Award-winning lecturer fired 
amid misconduct allegations

LEO VP says 
John Rubadeau is 
filing a grievance 
against U-M

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

On Tuesday, July 24, John 
Rubadeau, a University of Michigan 
senior lecturer, sent out an email to 
his colleagues within the English 
department informing them the 
University was terminating his 
employment before the remaining 
four years of his contract had 
expired.
According to his email, the 
University removed the 78-year-old 
lecturer from his position without 
benefits, effective Aug. 3. Motives 
behind the University’s action 
against Rubadeau, an instructor 
in the English department for 
33 years, remain unclear. Some 
of Rubadeau’s former students 
point to potential allegations of 

misconduct.
English department chair David 
Porter, as well as department 
undergraduate director Andrea 
Zemgulys declined to comment, 
and directed all questions to 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald wrote the 
University cannot comment on 
personnel matters.
“Our 
approach 
is 
designed 
to respect the privacy of our 
employees,” Fitzgerald wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily. “I 
can tell you that the university takes 
the termination of any employee 
very seriously and in each case these 
matters are carefully considered.”
Rubadeau 
also 
declined 
to 
comment due to legal concerns.
“Sadly, on the advice of my 
lawyer, I can not respond to any 
direct questions,” Rubadeau wrote 
in an email to The Daily. “I have 
much to say, and I should certainly 
like to say it to you, but my tongue is 
legally tied.”
University 
protocol 
directs 
complaints against faculty and staff 

through the Office for Institutional 
Equity, which operates under the 
authority of Title IX to investigate 
claims of misconduct. OIE is headed 
by Pamela Heatlie, who came 
under fire recently by students for 
mishandling bias cases.
Less 
than 
48 
hours 
after 
Rubadeau 
received 
news 
of 
the University’s final decision, 
University alum Parker Procida, 
who works as Rubadeau’s typist, 
sent out a mass email to more than 
4,000 former students informing 
them of the University’s decision 
and calling on them to contact 
University president Mark Schlissel 
on Rubadeau’s behalf.
“Most of you know and love 
John,” Procida wrote. “Three of 
John’s favorite words are ‘Quid pro 
quo.’ The man that has taught us 
all and given so much of his life to 
educating young people deserves a 
little quid pro quo-ing from those 
that he has impacted.”

Details emerge 
in prof’s death

Robert Sharp was 
stabbed 28 times, 
burned by ex-convict

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

Isom 
Hamilton, 
an 
ex-convict 
charged with the murder of Robert 
Sharp, a retired University of Michigan 
professor 
emeritus, 
underwent 
preliminary examination July 19 and 
has been scheduled for an August 30 
pretrial hearing before Judge Darlene 
O’Brien.
Sharp, who was 76 years old, taught 
in the U-M chemistry department for 
39 years before retiring in 2008. He 
held a doctorate from Case Western 
Reserve studying multidimensional and 
multiquantum NMR of paramagnetic 
systems, and completed his postdoc 
education at Oxford University.
Sharp was found dead in his home at 
3200 Alpine Drive on Monday, June 11. 
Police believe Hamilton killed Sharp on 
June 10 or 11, attempting to cover his 
tracks after breaking in for the second 
time in a week and discovering Sharp 
was home.
The AAPD entered Sharp’s home 
after his neighbors expressed concern 
over Sharp’s failure to show up for 
a community meeting. Police found 
heavy smoke residue in the home as 
well as bloody drag marks leading to 
the basement, where they discovered 
Sharp’s body.
“I followed the blood trail down 
the stairs into the basement,” said Ann 
Arbor police officer Craig Lee. “At the 
very bottom of the stairs, we did find the 
victim.”
Pathologist Jeffrey Jentzen testified 
Sharp died after suffering 28 knife 
wounds. A one-inch piece of knife blade, 
which investigators think Hamilton 
took from Sharp’s kitchen, was found 
lodged in Sharp’s neck vertebra.

Task Force calls for 
subpoena power

The group discusses 
responsibilites 
of future AAPD 
review board

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor Police Task Force 
met Wednesday night to continue 
documenting a plan for how the future 
official police review board would 
operate. Specifically, the task force 
discussed the powers and tools the 
future commission would need in 
order to perform its function of police 
oversight.
The group was created in early 2018 
to draft a proposal for a police oversight 
commission, in response to the police 
brutality and misconduct exemplified 
by the 2014 police shooting of Aura 
Rosser. The task force comprises 11 Ann 
Arbor residents.
During the early minutes of the 
meeting, Task Force Co-Chair Lori 
Saginaw proposed a system for 
streamlining the night’s meeting. She 

suggested task force members look 
at the problems listed in the meeting 
documents, which were handed out 
to task force members and the other 
community members in the audience, 
and then identify problems they found 
important, share their viewpoints and 
offer their solutions.
“Essentially, this page identifies what 
I felt were the four issues that we needed 
to get everyone’s thoughts on,” Saginaw 
said. “As a task force, we can figure out 
which ones we agree on, and which 
ones we don’t, and work on those.”
This plan for the night was not 
adopted however, as members of the 
task force felt it was not presented 
early enough. Voting member Dwight 
Wilson commented he would be 
willing to work on the document and 
have it prepared for a future meeting. 
Voting member Anna Gersh seconded 
Wilson’s position. Based on these 
shared feelings within the task force, it 
was decided to allow members to 
work on the document and bring 
their completed thoughts to the 
next Police Task Force meeting.

At age nine, more 
than one in 10 kids 
from urban areas 
have been expelled

By Katherina Sourine

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 
released a study in early July 
that 
explores 
elementary 
school 
disciplinary 
policy 
in urban cities, focusing on 
the demographics of affected 
children 
and 
investigating 
how racial inequality can be 
fostered at a young age.
Data was collected from 
Princeton University’s Fragile 
Families & Child Wellbeing 
Study, 
which 
conducted 
interviews with the primary 
caregivers of approximately 
5,000 children born in large 
cities 
between 
1998 
and 
2000. The U-M study aimed 
to explore elementary school 
exclusionary 
discipline 
— 
measures 
that 
remove 
a 
student from their educational 
environment — as well as racial 
variations within the policy 
and 
possible 
associations 
between 
exclusionary 
discipline 
and 
aggressive 
behavior.
According 
to 
the 
study, 
exclusionary 
discipline 
is 
“anything 
but 
a 
rare 
experience” 
in 
elementary 

schools; at age nine, more than 
one in 10 children born in urban 
areas have had suspension or 
expulsion on school records. 
Furthermore, these statistics 
disproportionately 
affect 
urban-born 
Black 
children, 
with about 40 percent of 
non-Hispanic 
black 
boys 
were suspended or expelled, 
compared to 8 percent of non-
Hispanic white or other-race 
boys.
Garrett Pace, U-M social 
work and sociology doctorate 
student, 
co-authored 
the 
study with colleagues from 
Pennsylvania State University. 
He emphasized the importance 
of 
implementing 
resources 
that 
foster 
more 
inclusive 
disciplinary 
practices, 
especially for racial minorities.
“Black 
children 
are 
disproportionately exposed to 
exclusionary discipline, and 
this is largely due to differences 
in 
school 
characteristics, 
family 
context, 
and 
home 
environments 
rather 
than 
differences 
in 
behavior 
problems,” Pace wrote in an 
email interview.
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
conducting 
these 
types 
of 
research 
projects at the University in 
order to improve the city and 
the University’s approaches to 
education.

U-M prof improves
water safety in lakes

After almost 
drowning, Jamie 
Racklyeft creates 
new intiative

By NATASHA PIETRUSCHKA

Daily Staff Reporter

Jamie Racklyeft, the commu-
nications director of the Michi-
gan Institute for Clinical and 
Health Research at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, knows second 
chances are rare. After nearly 
drowning off the shore of Van’s 
Beach in Leland, Michigan in 
2012, Racklyeft is leading the 
effort to end drownings in the 
Great Lakes.
In 2016, Racklyeft founded 
the Great Lakes Water Safety 
Consortium, a non-profit part-
nered with more than 350 orga-
nizations to create guidelines 
for water safety.
“There are a lot of people 
working on preventing drown-
ing in the Great Lakes, but they 
weren’t 
working 
together,” 
Racklyeft said. “That’s when I 
got involved as a communica-
tor. The more we can get people 
working together and collabo-
rating, the more we can find 
what’s working and what isn’t.”
A study by the Great Lakes 
Surf Rescue Project, one of 
GLWSC’s 
partners, 
reported 
there were 669 drownings in the 
Great Lakes from 2010 to 2018. 
According to Racklyeft, 85 per-
cent of drowning victims are 
male with a particular emphasis 
between ages 18 and 24. A study 
concluded males tend to over-
estimate their abilities in the 
water and are more susceptible 
to peer pressure.
LSA junior Connor Kippe 
explained pier diving was a com-
mon pastime for young adults in 
his hometown of Grand Haven, 
Michigan.
“Growing up, guys tend to be 
a little more flippant about risk 
and showing off,” Kippe said. 
“It was a thing people did. Some 
people would just watch, they 
wouldn’t always jump. Others 

would do tricks off the side of 
the pier.”
Water safety was part of Kip-
pe’s middle school health cur-
riculum, setting his school apart 
from many others in Michigan. 
But despite being educated on 
the subject, Kippe said people 
in his community and similar 
areas continue to participate in 
risky behavior.
Racklyeft recognized the dif-
ficulty of communicating the 
importance of water safety. 
“If they’ve gone to the lake 
before and they’ve been fine, 
they’ll think they’ll be fine 
again,” Racklyeft said. “There’s 
so many ways things can go 
wrong. How can we get that 
across? It’s tough. It’s not just 
about awareness. We can let 
them know, but does that mean 
it’ll 
change 
behavior? 
Not 
always.”
According to GLWSC, there 
are many factors that can con-
tribute to a drowning. Rip cur-
rents, powerful fluxes of water 
that jets away from shore and 
out into open water, are one of 
the main causes of drownings 
in the Great Lakes. “Flip, float 
and follow” is a universal tech-
nique used for escaping these 
currents. Rhett Register of the 
Michigan Sea Grant, another 
GLWSC partner, said someone 
caught in a rip current should 
never try to fight it.
“Even Michael Phelps can’t 
swim against a rip current, 
they’re so powerful,” Register 
said. “Flip over on your back, 
float for a second and follow 
the best path out of the current. 
Don’t fight the current.”
Swimmers can also prevent 
drowning by being prepared. 
According to Racklyeft, out 
of the 669 people who have 
drowned in the Great Lakes 
since 2010, only 5 of them were 
wearing life jackets. He also 
advises checking the National 
Weather Service before going 
to the beach and staying out of 
the water when waves are more 
than two to three feet high.

TMD talks to Council candidates about 
political controversy, plans for Ward 1

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor 

Ann Arbor’s Ward 1 City Coun-
cil candidates, Democrats Jef-
frey Hayner and Ron Ginyard 
and Democratic Socialist Ryan 
Hughes, spoke with The Michi-
gan Daily to address controversies 
surrounding their campaigns and 
to elaborate on their respective 
platforms.
Hayner, a 53-year-old busi-
ness owner who works in design 
and fabrication, and Ginyard, 
a 61-year-old retired financial 
adviser, will compete in the Aug. 
7 primaries. The winning Demo-
crat will face off against demo-
cratic socialist Ryan Hughes, a 
37-year-old computer program-
mer, in November. The candidates 
are vying to replace the incum-
bent representative, Sumi Kaila-
sapathy, D-Ward 1.
A July 23 MLive article drew 
attention to the Ward 1 City 
Council race by highlighting con-
troversial aspects of Ginyard and 
Hayner’s pasts. Specifically, the 
article mentioned Ginyard’s past 
financial difficulties and noted he 
hasn’t voted since moving back to 
Ann Arbor four years ago. MLive 
reporter Ryan Stanton also raised 
concern over some of Hayner’s 
contentious tweets.
In an email interview with 
The Daily, Ginyard, an Ann Arbor 
native who lived in California 
from 1970 to 2014, said he wasn’t 
able to give Stanton the whole 
story.
The MLive article cited the 
Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority’s BrokerCheck website, 

which reveals several complaints 
filed against Ginyard while he 
was working for investment firm 
Morgan Stanley in California. In 
2003, clients of Ginyard’s claimed 
he made poor investment sugges-
tions and they requested $525,000 
in compensation. The case was 
settled for $110,000. Different cli-
ents made similar claims in 1998 
but withdrew their case.
Regarding the 2003 complaint, 
Ginyard said the financial loss-
es of his clients — for whom he 
invested $600,000 — were a result 
of economic downturn.
“Over the course of three and a 
half years, I made a lot of money 
for them,” Ginyard wrote. “They 
withdrew a quarter of a million 
dollars during that time and still 
the value of their investment grew 
to $1,000,000. They were very 
disappointed when the market 
ate their gains during the tech-
nology crash of 2001, even though 
they were still up by $100,000 at 
the time they brought their com-
plaint.”
He added only two of the 
approximately 45,000 transac-
tions he completed during his 
32-year career ended in formal 
complaints.
Stanton’s article also notes sev-
eral tax liens were filed against 
Ginyard for failure to pay taxes 
between 1988 and 2013. The larg-
est claim was a $263,547 federal 
tax lien issued by the IRS in 2006.
Ginyard said family issues pre-
vented him from paying taxes on 
time, but he has now paid off all 
his debt.
“(O)ver that 18-year period I 
paid $280,000 in child support 

for my two daughters,” Ginyard 
wrote. “In addition, in the early 
1990s, the mother of my young-
est daughter was diagnosed with 
glaucoma and declared legally 
blind. This put additional pres-
sure on me to keep her household 
up and running, which included 
paying my daughter’s tuition for 
her first year at USC and pay-
ing all of her health insurance 
expenses. When you work for a 
firm like Morgan Stanley, a lot of 
your income comes from bonuses, 
so when the market fluctuates 
your income can vary widely from 
month to month.”
Responding to MLive’s cover-
age of Ginyard’s financial history, 
Hayner said he does not want to 
get involved in Ginyard’s personal 
business but does find it problem-
atic that Ginyard missed tax pay-
ments. Hayner said paying taxes 
gives a citizen the right to speak 
out about local policy issues.
“In this city, I think that our 
services are not commensurate 
with the prices we pay for them,” 
Hayner said. “I’m happy to go 
down and complain about them, 
because I pay.”
Hayner also took issue with 
Ginyard’s spotty voting record, 
another controversy addressed 
in Stanton’s article. Since moving 
to Ann Arbor four years ago, Gin-
yard has not voted once, including 
in the 2016 presidential election.
“I think it shows a complete 
lack of commitment to the sys-
tem,” Hayner said.

L

ast week in Helsinki 
with the whole world 
watching, 
President 
Donald Trump enthusias-
tically renounced any last 
semblance 
of 
presidential 
demeanor 
he 
possessed, 
yielding to one of America’s 
greatest foes with seeming 
indifference. Beside adver-
sarial strongman and Rus-
sian 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin, Trump issued a stun-
ning rebuke of all 17 U.S. 
intelligence agencies and an 
emphatic denial of Putin’s 
chicanery 
in 
the 
same 
breath, an act appropriately 
chastised as the most embar-
rassing presidential perfor-
mance in recent memory 
(even after his post-summit 
statement 
that 
supposed-
ly “clarifies things pretty 
good”).
In absolving himself of the 
president’s paternal obliga-
tion to stand firmly against 
national 
enemies, 
Trump 
went one step too far, even 
in a presidency where mis-
rule is the norm. It is not 
just that Russia’s interests 
often run afoul of our own – 
its regime routinely violates 
the human rights of journal-
ists and other political dissi-
dents, is engaged in a lengthy 
and brutal proxy war with 
the United States, illegally 
annexed sovereign Ukrai-
nian territory in an affront 
to post-Cold War rules and 
order, and more than any-
thing maliciously interfered 
in the most sacred of Ameri-
can political institutions.
Other than the obvious con-
clusion that Putin returned 
from Helsinki emboldened 
to embark on his next sinis-
ter pursuit, the Trump-Putin 
summit made clear there are 
only three possible explana-
tions for the chief executive’s 
stunt.
First, Trump is irretriev-
ably ignorant of the intrica-
cies of foreign affairs and is 
equally impervious to the 
attempts of those around 
him to roll back his per-
sonalist approach to world 
leaders. Second, Trump has 
been 
personally 
compro-
mised by Putin (surely a long 
shot, between the honest 
authoritarian and the sexu-
ally wholesome frequenter 
of Russia), and will not hesi-
tate to protect himself at the 
expense of the United States. 
Third, Trump is even more 
selfish and psychologically 
fragile than previously imag-
ined, and desires more than 

anything to indulge his ego 
in his 2016 presidential elec-
tion victory – even if feeding 
the narrative that his Her-
culean feat was unassisted 
comes at the cost of elevating 
a dictator’s word above that of 
U.S. intelligence officials. Or 
some combination of them.
Accepting any of the expla-
nations for Trump’s behavior 
only demands the belief that 
Trump’s 
well-documented 
narcissism is so overcoming as 
to blind him to the best inter-
ests of the country he governs 
– not a stretch by most stan-
dards. For a figure as poorly 
versed in public service and 
foreign policy as Trump, the 
shameful display in Helsinki 
may alternately be explained 
by the president’s inadequa-
cy with regard to executive 
statesmanship as much as it is 
by his lack of commitment to 
the public.
Regardless of the expla-
nation, Trump’s uniquely 
deleterious statements made 
unequivocally obvious his 
woeful inability to perform 
the basic duties of a world 
leader. Therefore, Congress 
should 
objectively 
have 
no qualms in considering 
impeachment; a sparingly 
used tool that, according 
to constitutional architect 
George Mason, was afforded 
to Congress as a “mode of 
displacing an unfit magis-
trate.” America’s ability to 
remove an unfaithful and/
or severely incapable execu-
tive in the direst of circum-
stances remains, however, 
intertwined with the politics 
of the lawmakers to which it 
is entrusted.
It is unsurprising, then, 
that even after the summit 
fiasco, the Republican-dom-
inated House and Senate 
have so far distanced them-
selves from anything close 
to calls for Trump’s removal. 
This congressional inaction 
is what one would expect, 
of course, in a country fur-
ther removed from apoliti-
cal unity than ever, perhaps. 
For Trump’s hegemonic base, 
unwavering in its loyalty to 
figure above ideology or even 
state, 
Trump’s 
blundering 
betrayal is nothing more than 
the next hill on which to die 
in the culture wars, and any 
serious critics in Washington 
will be met with fire and fury 
accordingly.

T

his is part one in a two-
part series on an experi-
ence abroad in Chile.
Living in Chile this past 
month has served as a remind-
er of the significance of my 
social identity as a U.S. citizen 
and a woman, the implications 
of which can be something I 
tend to take for granted.
Before attending the Uni-
versity of Michigan, I lived in 
Peru for a year, and my experi-
ences there left me with mixed 
emotions towards this part 
of my identity. At times, I was 
grateful for being born in the 
U.S. and all the advantages the 
“lottery of birth” had bestowed 
upon me. At other times, I 
wished I was not at all associat-
ed with the U.S. because of the 
negative reactions I would get 
from people when they realized 
my citizenship. Peru was a long 
time ago and I never really real-
ized how important my identity 
as a U.S. citizen was in shaping 
my experience abroad until I 
returned to South America once 
again for a three-month intern-
ship in Chile.
My Spanish was much bet-
ter this time around when I 
arrived in Chile than it was 
when I first arrived in Peru, so 
I blended in better and was able 
to even pass as Chilean at times. 
Now, when I see other tourists 
or people passing through who 
speak in poor Spanish with 

heavy American accents, I find 
myself making assumptions 
about them as well. I have been 
there and I understand the dif-
ficulty of trying to survive in a 
foreign country with a different 
language and culture, but I also 
understand why I stood out as 
a foreigner so much during my 
first few months in Peru. I am 
still the same girl from Min-
nesota, but I also feel like the 
language and culture of South 
America are becoming greater 
parts of my identity as well—so 
much so that it is hard for me 
to identify with travelers from 
North America who I happen 
to meet in passing. This new 
realization is exciting for me 
as I can honestly say that I am 
fully assimilated here in South 
America and that I even feel at 
home.
One big difference between 
my time in Peru and my time 
in Chile is that here in Chile I 
am not reminded constantly 
of my identity as a woman as 
I was in Peru, due to a variety 
of different reasons. In Peru, 
I was always cautioned about 
leaving the house alone and was 
often harassed on the streets, 
at university and, at times, at 
home because I was a woman. 
One of the cultural norms in 
Peru is that women, especially 
younger women, do not leave 
the house except to go to school 
or if they are accompanied by a 

male. This norm is not without 
grounds as gender violence 
towards women is a huge 
issue in Peru, as in many parts 
of South America, and most 
parents see preventing their 
daughters from leaving the 
house as a way to protect them. 
Women are also expected to 
contribute more in terms of 
chores. They cook, clean, wash 
the laundry and often take 
care of their younger siblings. 
However, teen boys spend their 
time out with friends and are 
hardly ever required to help 
with housework, and they are 
expected to act macho or “like a 
man.” Boys in their early teen-
age years have more freedom 
than some women have in their 
entire lifetime. I was very for-
tunate to have incredible host 
moms in all my host families 
who made it possible for me 
to have more freedom during 
my time in Peru by advocating 
for me at my university and at 
home, an advantage that many 
fellow female exchange stu-
dents and Peruvian friends did 
not have. As someone who grew 
up in an environment in which 
I always felt I was treated as 
equal to men, living in a place 
in which your sex very much 
defines you was an unpleasant 
shock that left me angry and 
even scared at times.

JULIA MONTAG| COLUMN

A

s covered in Part 1 of this 
three-part series, a look at 
nationwide opioid overdose 

data led me to question the presence 

of an epidemic here at the University 

of Michigan, and, upon investigat-

ing, I was confounded by shockingly 

low numbers. The 2016 University of 

Michigan National College Health 

Assessment shows 98.5 percent of 

respondents answering “never” when 

asked about the frequency of their 

opiate use. Michigan is not the only 

campus that the opioid epidemic has 

skipped, Grace Bird says for Insid-

erEd. University of Wisconsin-Madi-

son recently instituted an agreement 

with pharmacy chain Walgreens to 

allow students to buy overdose-coun-

tering Narcan, even though opioid 

misuse at the school is “exceptionally 

rare,” Bird writes. Like the University 

of Michigan, the University of Tennes-

see-Knoxville has a police department 

that stocks Narcan; U-M officers have 

only needed to administer it twice, 

which is two more times than needed 

in Knoxville.

“I would agree with the general 

observation, one supported by the 

NCHA data, that the campus com-

munity has largely been spared by the 

dramatic rise in opioid use compared 

to the general population,” Robert 

Ernst, medical director of U-M Uni-

versity Health Service, says. But if 

the entire country is being hit with 

the serious crisis that is addiction to 

prescription pain relievers, what’s 

keeping the numbers so low on many 

campuses?

Colleges have avoided the rise in 

drug use, Bird claims, because the 

epidemic “discriminate[s] in terms 

of education, as it disproportionately 

affects poorer, more rural and less-

educated communities.” She explains 

the research that connects individuals 

with lower educational attainment to 

scarce, dangerous job opportunities — 

opportunities that increase the risk of 

workplace injuries and make use of an 

opioid painkiller likely.
Now, I am no doctor, but my 
extensive digging within the drug 
discussion showed me one important 
factor that college campuses have in 
common: Schools across the country 
are continuously pumping out novel, 
influential studies that work to com-
bat the crisis. An immense amount 
of research takes place at these edu-
cational hubs, including Ohio State 
University, University of Miami, 
University of Maryland — the list 
goes on — and I’d go as far as to say 

that this research is what’s suppress-

ing addiction within this subpopula-

tion. Universities are assembling vast 

resources to prevent and intervene 

upon addiction, as well as promote 

treatment and recovery. Perhaps sheer 

proximity to this information is what’s 

subduing addiction at the student level.

To corroborate this theory, I took a 

look into Michigan Medicine through 

a specific and inquisitive lens: What 

exactly is it about our university that 

keeps us from misusing? I found 

that the University of Michigan has 

assembled some brilliant minds, and 

they’re at the forefront of the crisis 

with power, intelligence and innova-

tion. Schools around the country are 

citing the University’s groundbreak-

ing studies to create the foundations 

of their programs. We have the safety 

nets and safety blankets of Wolverine 

Wellness and the CRP, just as we have 

the recovery-safe housing and medica-

tion disposal programs; we also have 

some of the country’s leading experts 

on drug misuse, and they’re working 

to revolutionize the way that the entire 

country tackles the crisis.

Among those professionals is Sean 

Esteban McCabe, an “internation-

ally recognized scholar” and former 

director of the University of Michi-

gan Substance Abuse Research Cen-

ter. McCabe is rolling out studies that 

focus on the trends of prescription 

opioid use among U.S. adolescents and 

college students by analyzing motives, 

methods of administration and symp-

toms of disorder. In his study that 

attempted to clarify when and why 

people begin to misuse drugs, McCabe 

found that “most adolescents become 

fully responsible for their own medi-

cation management for the first time 

in their lives during college and are 

presented with more opportunities for 

— and a higher expectation of — sub-

stance use.” It’s possible that his work 

has so powerfully aided in our under-

standing of why this crisis began that 

it sparked other campus programs and 

projects that mitigate concerns and 

take control of addiction.

Exhibit A: the Opioid Overdose 

Summit in 2015, hosted by the U-M 

Injury 
Prevention 
Center, 
which 

assembled folks around the com-

munity and started important con-

versations surrounding the growing 

epidemic. The University also par-

ticipated in the 2018 Opioid Abuse & 

Heroin Overdose Solutions Summit, 

where various doctors and residents 

presented on their specialties within 

the field. We have invaluable tools 

manufactured by our medical profes-

sionals and students, including the 

Michigan-made Opioid Prescribing 

Recommendations for Surgery. The 

website, of use to all patients in any 

hospital, provides new, lower recom-

mended dosages of different pain-

killers for different surgeries and 

procedures. “(W)hen patients are 

prescribed fewer pills, they consume 

fewer pills with no changes in pain 

or satisfaction scores,” the site reads. 

The suggestions were developed by 

Michigan OPEN, or the Opioid Pre-

scribing Engagement Network, which 

was established in 2016 with support 

from the Institute for Healthcare Pol-

icy and Innovation at the University 

of Michigan. Using patient-reported 

data, researchers found that previ-

ous recommended dosages swamp 

patients by meeting and oftentimes 

exceeding self-reported use, as dis-

cussed on the website.
Ernst explained to me yet another 
feature of our health system that 
fortifies proper prescribing efforts: 
changes implemented to the pre-
scribing functionality of the com-
mon electronic health record system 
shared between UHS and the aca-
demic medical center. The advan-
tages of those changes, rolled out just 
over the past few months, include a 
“single-click sign-on to the Michi-
gan Automated Prescription Sys-
tem which provides for review by 
the prescriber a detailed report of 
all previously filled controlled sub-
stance prescriptions by that patient,” 
Ernst explained. “… No prescrip-
tions for controlled substances, new 
or renewal, can be completed now 
without the provider first attesting 
to the fact that the MAPS report has 
been reviewed.” In addition to this 
detailed list, information packets 
that outline risks of overdose and 
dependence are now automatically 
provided for patients filling new pre-
scriptions. Additionally, “for acute 
pain, the duration of prescribed opi-
oids is limited to a maximum of seven 
days in order to prevent the occur-
rence of leaving unused pills,” Ernst 
said. Together, these novel features 
are paving the way for other medi-
cal centers to counter the norm and 
make new rules. 

So what is it that keeps campus-

es from misusing? I believe it’s the 

McCabes, the Injury Prevention Cen-

ters, the thought-provoking summits 

and recommendations, and the con-

sequential organizations that marshal 

vast troops of affiliates to exchange 

ideas and confront community issues 

head-on. I believe we fortunately live 

in a community where these influ-
ences are within reach.

OPINION

Thursday, August 2nd, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By 
polarizing 
the 
debate over Trump’s most 
blatant 
disregard 
for 
national concern yet, his 
coterie of supporters has 
ensured any full-throated 
defense 
of 
American 
sovereignty will be met 
with substantial outcry, 
thereby redirecting GOP 
politicians 
toward 
the 
path of least of resistance. 
 
As they have repeatedly 
made 
clear, 
Republican 
lawmakers 
have 
heard 
the message and will not 
hold Trump accountable 
if 
it 
means 
upsetting 
constituents — even if 
impeachment (or at least 
moving toward it) will 
mitigate future damage 
to American international 
standing. 
In light of unending 
congressional deference to 
Trump’s ignobility, there 
seems to be little hope for 
recourse, a prospect even 
more disconcerting given 
the momentum of Russia’s 
continuing 
campaigns 
against 
American 
domestic 
security 
and 
overseas interests. Just 
as it is futile to hope that 
Trump will change his 
predispositions, it is naïve 
to call upon Republican 
members 
of 
Congress 
to 
sacrifice 
their 
own 
electoral security for some 
higher 
cause 
(perhaps 
a justification in and of 
itself for doing away with 
the 
two-party 
system 
and its many maladies). 
Republican 
lawmakers’ 
predictable 
and 
demonstrated preference 
for political expediency 
speaks to an era where 
reminiscing on the days of 
“bipartisanship” is hokey 
at 
best, 
and 
deceptive 

at 
worst, 
demanding 
a 
Congress 
capable 
of 
pushback.
As Trump’s rhetoric has 
moved beyond bombastic 
to outright terrifying, he 
has proved himself beyond 
deserving of impeachment 
and possible removal from 
office. Deliberation on the 
true nature of his historic 
missteps will not become 
a reality as long as those 
lawmakers poised to forgo 
the nonpartisan duties of 
the legislature remain in 
power. Accommodation 
of Trump and his ever-
flirtatious 
dance 
with 
outright 
treason 
can 
therefore come to a close 
only under a Congress 
headed by the Democrats, 
necessitating widespread 
electoral 
support 
for 
blue House and Senate 
candidates come this fall. 
To 
be 
clear, 
this 
is 
not a partisan call for 
a 
Democratic 
takeover 
of 
Congress 
predicated 
on liberal policy toward 
health 
care, 
abortion 
access, 
gun 
control 
or 
any 
other 
hot-button 
political issue – it is a 
straightforward 
demand 
for Congress to put its 
allegiance 
to 
America 
first, and act deliberately 
when the man elected to 
the nation’s highest office 
so clearly fails to do so. 
No longer answering to 
Trump’s steadfast base, 
maybe a new majority of 
Democratic 
legislators 
can, as Mason envisioned, 
contain 
our 
unfit 
magistrate.

ARTS

With just one look at the 2018 
lineup for Mo Pop Festival, anyone 
with a decent grip on modern 
music knew the event was going 
to be a hit. Stationed in Detroit’s 
West RiverFront Park adjacent to 
the Detroit River, with Detroit’s 
eclectic skyline as a backdrop and 
equally eclectic acts like Bon Iver, 
The National, BROCKHAMPTON, 
Billie Eilish, Rex Orange County, 
Homeshake and Clairo, all the Mo 
Pop administration had to do to 
satisfy ticket-holders was not make 
a Fyre Festival. And they did exactly 
that. 
The festival was organized to 
maximize the music on display: 
Two stages, 200 yards apart, an 
overlap-free (a.k.a. anxiety- and 
regret-free) performance schedule 
and minimal other attractions save 
a neat arcade courtesy of Punch 
Bowl Social. There wasn’t much 
going on, but not much has to go 
on when you’re hopping back-and-
forth from Clairo to Rex Orange 
County to Homeshake to Billie 
Eilish to Alvvays — does a more 
solid quintuple threat exist?
The minimalist nature of the 
festival also made it easy on social 
groups; with just two stages and 
a one-act-at-a-time platform, the 
dreaded group-schisms that tend 
to plague big events like music 
festivals were pretty avoidable.
— Mike Watkins, Daily Arts 
Writer
Clairo
The queen of bedroom pop 
had an extremely impressive and 
dynamic backing band, something 
unexpected from an artist who first 

turned heads with her minimalism. 
The drums knocked, the bass 
bumped, and the guitar cooed, 
making for a steadily enjoyable set 
and a great start to my Saturday at 
Mo Pop. 
— Mike Watkins
Rex Orange County 
Charming British, boyish singer/
songwriter or just a bad Frank 
Ocean?
— Mike Watkins
When I first saw Alexander 
O’Connor, 
from 
a 
distance, 
I 
thought he kind of looked like Bo 
Burnham. He wore a colorful, 
striped tee shirt that set him apart 
from the rest of his band, and he had 
an self-assured way of singing that 
at times made it feel more like he 
was reciting poetry. His deliveries 
of “Best Friend” and “Untitled” 
were surprisingly touching, but the 
most tender moment came during 
“Loving Is Easy,” when everyone 
in the crowd joined together to sing 
along. As one of the earlier acts on 
Saturday, Rex Orange County was 
instrumental (get it?) in setting 
the tone for the rest of the festival. 
While later acts might have been 
more explosively memorable, Rex 
Orange County brought a shrewd 
sentimentality onstage that added 
color to Mo Pop as a whole.
— Laura Dzubay, Daily Arts 
Writer
Billie Eilish
My friend told me Billie was 
16 and I collapsed in a fit of self-
loathing and jealousy. This young 
woman controlled her crowd like 
a seasoned pop star and is primed 
for a boundless music career (see: 

Lorde).
— Mike Watkins
Alvvays
If Mo Pop was a dream, Alvvays 
was the moment when you’re falling 
asleep and you let go of everything 
that kept you tired. The indie set 
was a excellent precursor to Vince 
Staples and Bon Iver, and a perfect 
experience of synth pop in general. 
Molly Rankin led the audience 
on a carousel ride through songs 
like “Dreams Tonite” and “Archie, 
Marry Me,” hitting every note with 
exuberance and spirit.
— Laura Dzubay
Vince Staples
Probably the most fun experience 
of Saturday was being in the crowd 
for Vince Staples late in the evening, 
jumping and shouting along to 
songs like “Norf Norf,” “Big Fish” 
and “Get the Fuck Off My Dick.” 
Staples himself was charming. 
His was the last act before the 
headliner, Bon Iver, which seemed 
like an appropriate way to round off 
the night. Staples was energetic and 
exciting, a bang on which things 
easily could have ended, and Bon 
Iver was able to seal the deal under 
the stars afterward.
— Laura Dzubay
Bon Iver
The money set; the big kahuna; 
the primary reason Mo Pop was 
such a draw this summer: Bon 
Iver. Indie’s king, Justin Vernon, 
and his band graced Detroit for the 
first time ever to deliver the most 
unbelievable live performance I 
have ever seen.
The stage was filled to the 
brim 
with 
music 
equipment. 

Ten feet from the stage, I stood 
in anticipation wondering what 
Vernon and his men planned to 
do to me with these sonic tools. 
I predicted where Vernon would 
stand and planted myself between 
two 12-foot men for the perfect 
view. When the band assumed their 
positions on stage, the crowd fell 
under Vernon’s electro-folk spell for 
an hour and a half. The ear-tickling 
falsettos of For Emma, Forever 
Ago and Bon Iver, Bon Iver and the 
digital mush of 22, A Million merged 
seamlessly under Vernon’s raw 
and passionate stage presence; his 
modified melodies, lively shouts and 
charged audio pulsated through 
the crowd to create an experience 
impossible to achieve anywhere but 
a live setting.
For the last song of the set, “The 
Wolves,” Vernon enlisted the crowd 
to loop the phrase, “What might 
have been lost,” as the band grew 
their sound to a chaotic crescendo. 
As the performance peaked, the 
crowd screamed ferociously in an 
exhilarating atmosphere of pure 
emotion that seemed to bridge the 
gap between the performers and 
the audience for a brief moment. 
The song ended; Bon Iver thanked 
the crowd and exited the stage; I 
was satisfied. 
Then, in front of the dark stage, 
the crowd began to stir; the same 
phrase, “What might have been 
lost,” grew from a timid experiment 
to a roaring beckon in which you 
couldn’t help but participate. We 
were calling on Bon Iver, but with a 
more personal touch that reflected 
the band’s ability to impress and 
move its fans. Eventually, dark 
shadows hopped across the unlit 
stage, and the band returned for an 
encore. Bon Iver gave us a fitting 
and introspective reminder of our 
own mortality with a performance 
of “22 (OVER SOON)” and left for 
good.
— Mike Watkins
Early on in Bon Iver’s set, I 
lingered toward the middle of the 
enormous crowd, trying to figure 
out what I was supposed to be 
feeling. Periodically I’d close my 
eyes and tune into the live renditions 
from 22, A Million swelling from 
the stage speakers — but I was also 
acutely aware of a group of people 
standing nearby, who kept breaking 
the rapt silence of the audience with 
loud shouting and peals of drunken 
laughter. Live music tends to be a bit 
of a mixed bag in this way, but as the 
set went on, we wriggled forward 
in the crowd, gaining both distance 
from the noise and a slightly better 
view of the stage.
The immersion, for me, happened 

gradually, but it also happened 
naturally, because Bon Iver’s music 
is nothing if not immersive. Almost 
everyone in the crowd closed their 
eyes and swayed to the music, 
standing near friends and the ones 
they loved while a bright full moon 
perched high above the Detroit 
River and the lights of Windsor. 
It’s hard to say what was more 
transfixing — the sounds of Bon Iver, 
or the sight of the moon’s reflection 
spreading over the river — but then 
again, this didn’t feel like an either/
or situation. Everything that was 
mesmerizing, was mesmerizing at 
once.
Anyone who came looking to 
hear strictly softcore acoustic tracks 
like “Skinny Love” and “Re: Stacks” 
might have been disappointed or 
at least surprised by their setlist 
on Saturday, which covered a wide 
variety of material spanning across 
all of their eclectic releases from the 
last ten years. But it ended up being 
an ideal ending to the day as the 
atmospheric synths and hypnotic, 
high-pitched vocals filled West 
Riverfront Park, sending us off for 
the first good night of the weekend.
— Laura Dzubay
St. Vincent
A neon goddess. Annie Clark 
wore a tight orange dress and heels 
that looked like they’d been flown 
in from outer space (or some ‘70s 
or ‘80s vision of it, anyway) and she 
switched to a new bright color of 
electric guitar every couple of songs. 
She shared the space of the stage 
equally with guitarist Toko Yasuda, 
keyboardist Daniel Mintseris and 
drummer Matt Johnson, the latter 
two of whom moved only minimally 
and robotically, and wore bizarre 
masks that obscured their faces. 
On the screen behind her, music 
videos displayed Clark in a variety 
of situations that felt bizarre and 
sometimes 
body-horror-esque: 
stepping 
through 
hoops 
and 
climbing ladders in increasingly 
sped-up and boomeranged footage, 
speaking into a telephone while 
bright blue vomit dripped from her 
lips.
Every 
movement 
was 
coordinated 
and 
confident, 
every 
song 
captivating. 
St. 
Vincent’s closing performance of 
“Happy Birthday, Johnny” was 
unquestionably the most heartfelt 
and personal moment of Mo Pop, 
and a clear reminder to the audience 
that while we had all come here to 
share this moment with each other, 
the artists were sharing it with us, 
too.

Thursday, August 2, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Rap’s current state of affairs 
is puzzling, to say the least. 
Juggernauts like the Migos, Drake 
and J. Cole have put out some of the 
most stagnant music of their careers 
and have plateaued artistically. 
Pusha T appears to be the last of 
rap’s old guard who can drop a 
quality album. Female rappers like 
Cardi B and CupcakKe are blazing 
a 
much-needed 
trail 
critically 
and commercially. We finally got 
the Kid Cudi/Kanye West collab 
which would’ve blown our minds 
eight years ago, only released to 
much less fanfare; Cudi shines 
having confronted his struggles and 
addictions, while Kanye, to put it 
lightly, is taking crazy pills. Another 
burgeoning, mumbling, problematic 
superstar in XXXTentacion was 
murdered in broad daylight, but the 
public can’t immediately decide if 
that was a good or a bad thing.
While all this is going on, while 
Chief Keef is hunting 6ix9ine down 
on a cross-country beef, while 
rappers like Lil Pump and Trippie 
Redd are becoming the new norm, 
Denzel Curry sat perched, watching 
over this baffling bizarro world like 
a stone gargoyle. And with his latest 
full length TA13OO, he swooped in, 
with ghoulish demeanor and the 
precision of a silver stake piercing 
Dracula’s heart.
Critics are often quick to lump 
Denzel Curry into the ambiguous 
realm of SoundCloud rap. Although 
Curry is of the same DNA as 

fellow South Florida denizens like 
Smokepurpp and Ski Mask the 
Slump God, if anything, he’s the 
genre’s Grim Reaper. Here to take 
names and collect souls, Curry has 
made a name for himself for being as 
sharp as a swinging scythe and hard 
as steel. Even if you’ve never heard 
of him, there’s a chance you’ve 
heard of his insanely high energy 
“Ultimate” (most likely as the viral 
soundtrack to a handful of Vines in 
the platform’s last days).
On the mic, Denzel raps like a 
man possessed, with many a heart-
pounding beat to back him up. His 
2016 release Imperial managed 
to sustain the same verve of 
“Ultimate” for 40 minutes, so when 

he announced TA13OO last year 
(backed up by 13, a five-track EP 
of demos), his fanbase was rightly 
scared. The proper genre to describe 
Curry’s output is “music that makes 
you want to commit large-scale 
arson and/or tax fraud.” Another 
hour of hard-hitting insanity would 
be sure to start a real-life version of 
“The Purge.”
Yet while most of his previous 
work was turbulent, pedal-to-the-
metal momentum, TA13OO is smart 
to control its acceleration, starting 
at zero and gradually building up 
speed to get to 100. Split up into 
three “acts” of four to five songs 
each — Light, Gray and Dark — there 

is a flow of tone that revitalizes and 
re-energizes Denzel and keeps the 
album consistently sounding fresh. 
Even straight-up bangers can get 
repetitive sometimes.
Opening 
track 
“TABOO” 
is an oddly ethereal way to 
rope the listener in; Denzel is 
uncharacteristically soulful, singing 
his way through emotional damage 
and trauma and functioning as a 
spirit guide who’s warning us of the 
path ahead. “BLACK BALLOONS” 
and 
“CASH 
MANIAC” 
are 
refreshing quasi-summer grooves, 
smooth as the GoldLink feature on 
the former but peppered with talk of 
suicide and drowning in excess. But 
just when you thought Denzel was 
going soft on you, he ends Act One 
with “SUMO,” and the real madness 
of TA13OO begins.
“SUMO,” alongside Act Three 
cut “PERCS,” follow the same 
formula that Zeltron perfected on 
“Ultimate” — ten or so seconds of a 
neutered version of the main beat 
that puts you into the same scramble 
that sirens forewarning the coming 
of a natural disaster would, then 
a perfect storm of trenchant bars 
and unstoppable flow. The rest of 
the album sustains this brand of 
aggression, but Denzel Curry finds 
new ways to innovate and harness 
his raw power.
“SUPER SAIYAN SUPERMAN” 
is a detached two-minute sprint; 
imagine Denzel’s eyes rolling into 
the back of his head “Exorcist”-
style when he was recording 
that 
in 
the 
booth. 
“SIRENS” 
and “VENGEANCE” excellently 
incorporate the style of its guest 

rappers in J.I.D and JPEGMAFIA, 
respectively. Curry showcases his 
technically ability and impressively 
varies his cadence and delivery on 
the aptly-named “SWITCH IT UP.”
TA13OO never strays far from 
its carnival horror ride concept, 
which manages to ground its 
seemingly 
unrestrained 
zeal. 
Without proper explanation, the 
tracks are stylized in all caps then 
followed by a numerical spelling 
(“THE BLACKEST BALLOON” 
becomes 
“THE 
13LACKEZT 
13ALLOON,” for example). There 
is also an unholy reverence to the 
number 13, which Curry previously 
described as “something to be 
afraid of worldwide, the part of 
an 
unfortunate 
distorted 
life.” 
This 
twisted 
triskaidekaphobia, 
along with the embracing of the 
melancholy, paranoia and dark 
subject matter that frame the album, 
seems to be an unorthodox way of 
confronting fear. Denzel’s method 
of diminishing terror is allowing 
himself to mosh alongside it.
The scary themes like hatred, 
revenge and near-death experiences 
that haunt TA13OO’s halls only 
grow more frightening as the album 
approaches its fiery conclusion. 
The 
end 
of 
“VENGEANCE” 
followed by first few seconds of 
“BLACK METAL TERRORIST” 
are a beautiful little breather from 

the nonstop vehemence, but if 
someone like Denzel gives you a 
breather, you best know you’re in 
for something potent. “BLACK 
METAL 
TERRORIST” 
is 
the 
result of a fusion dance between 
“Ultimate” and “SUMO” and quite 
frankly the hardest fucking song 
you’ll hear all year. “I am the mark 
of the beast,” screams Curry, who 
moves 
“tortuously, 
killin’ 
[his] 
infidels effortlessly.”
While he certainly goes for 
the throat of his contemporaries 
on songs like “BLACK METAL 
TERRORIST,” 
Denzel 
has 
a 
concerned 
message 
for 
his 
troubled contemporaries on Act 
Two closer “CLOUT COBAIN.” 
Its accompanying video plays out 
like the nightmare you would have 
after watching “It” with the sound 
off and “Gucci Gang” on repeat in 
the background. From the title and 
simple lyrics, one would think this 
is yet another entry in the catalog of 
rap songs glamorizing the Nirvana 
frontman’s suicide for a shitty 
metaphor. However, Curry’s intent 
is subversive; the refrain “I just 
wanna feel myself, you want me 
to kill myself” and the visuals are 
both a criticism of the new class of 
rappers and a call to action.

‘TA13OO’ is a formal invite 
to Denzel Curry’s haunting

City Council 
talks design 

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor 

Ann Arbor City Council unan-
imously passed a resolution 
Monday, June 16, calling for an 
evaluation of the city’s design 
review process for downtown 
developments. The resolution 
instructs the Planning Com-
mission to appraise Ann Arbor’s 
protocol, comparing it to that 
of other cities, and to outline a 
plan for improving the review 
process before Oct. 15, 2018.
Drafted by Councilmember 
Kirk Westphal, D-Ward 2, the 
resolution is backed by Mayor 
Christopher Taylor and Coun-
cilmembers Chuck Warpehoski, 
D-Ward 5, Graydon Krapohl, 
D-Ward 4, and Julie Grand, 
D-Ward 3. Downtown develop-
ment has been at the forefront 
of many recent City Council 
discussions, as in the Library 
Lot controversy, and has also 
inspired new legislation.
Currently, 
new 
downtown 
developments go through the 
Design Review Board, a seven-
person commission established 
in 2011 that comments on the 
compliance of new proposals 
with Ann Arbor’s Downtown 
Design Guidelines. The Design 
Review Board’s recommenda-
tions are not legally binding.
Westphal said he thought it 
necessary to evaluate the Design 
Review Board because so many 
City Councilmembers receive 
comments from residents about 
new developments. He said City 
Council unanimously recogniz-
es Ann Arbor’s review process 
is not fully serving the commu-
nity, but clarified the resolution 
is not a criticism of the Design 
Review Board.
“I think if there’s one thing 
that every single Councilmem-
ber agrees with it is that we’ve 
heard different kinds of feed-
back about downtown build-
ings,” Westphal said. “This, I 
think, will always be an evolv-
ing process; I think it’s an evolv-
ing process for every growing 
city.”

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Playing more than a “Black Woman” 

 So, I’ve been doing a lot of 
writing lately… Whenever 
my life gets real messy or 
whatever, I turn to writing 
to kind of just detach 
from 
everything 
that’s 
happening 
all 
around 
me. It’s like this super 
cathartic 
practice 
I’ve 
taken up over the years 
to decompress and flush a 
bunch of things from my 
head all at once. I’m never 
as well-spoken as I’d like to 
be in person. Like … okay, 
honestly? I’m literally the 
furthest 
possible 
thing 
from well-spoken, but it’s 
for this exact reason that 
I’ve come to write as much 
as I do. Outside the realm 
of academics, my writing 
doesn’t have to follow any 
specific form or tone. I can 
be as formal or as casual 
as I’d like to be, as flowery 
or as vulgar as is needed 
of me. I really end up just 
writing about anything, 
honestly.
 The other day I was on 
the phone with my mom 
and I asked her about 
the meaning of my name: 
Vinh 
Khang 
Huynh. 
Vinh means “eternal” or 
“infinite,” while Khang 
means 
“health” 
and 
“prosperity.” Huynh just 
represents a family name 
distantly linked to royalty. 
I wrote about my own 
name for damn near an 
hour before I remembered 
that I had a life outside of 
writing I had to care for. I 
just really liked thinking 
about the concept of some 
infinitely bountiful sense 
of well-being marked by 
the subtleties of royalty 
being carried on through 
my own name. Writing 
plummets me down deeper 
and deeper into this rabbit 
hole of self-reflection. I’ve 
come to learn that asking 
myself why I am the way 
that I am and why I do the 
things that I do is the most 
surefire 
means 
toward 
both 
understanding 
myself and learning to do 
the same for others. The 

two questions that’ve had 
me parading about in my 
feels the most have been: 
“Why do I choose to write 
so much?” and “What 
exactly do I gain from of 
all of it?”
 So, throwback to my 
first day of sophomore 
year of high school. I find 
the classroom where my 
first-period English class 
is being taught and go to 
grab a seat toward the 
back, next to the wall. 
Eventually, a woman walks 
in, introduces herself as 
Ms. Brush and welcomes 
us all to her English class. 
I guess she really wasn’t 
trying to shoot the shit 
that morning, given that 
she just skipped right 
past the whole icebreaker 
and 
syllabus-recitation 
tradition and had us all 
pull out pieces of paper. 
Our assignment for that 
first morning of class was 
to write a letter addressed 
to anyone, living or dead, 
about any possible topic 
under the sun. I wrote my 
letter to a friend of mine, 
knowing full well that he 
would never read it since 
I obviously had to turn 
it in at the end of class. I 
gave myself the freedom 
to write about every little 
thing on my mind, so much 
so that I forgot that it was 
an actual assignment.
 The next day in class, 
Brush sat at the front of 
the room and called our 
names out one by one 
as she handed back our 
letters. I don’t remember 
exactly what she told me, 
but I remember that she 
complimented me both 
on how my voice shined 
through the letter as well 
as my choice in expletives. 
I walked up to the room to 
grab my letter, flustered 
and embarrassed as all 
hell. I was never the type 
of student to be noticed for 
anything in class, so it felt 
strange to be recognized 
for something like my 
voice by someone I had 
just met the day before.
 As the term rolled on, we 
would be asked to submit 

these mini-reports on the 
stuff we were supposed to 
be reading for class. To be 
honest, I never actually … 
well … read the books or 
anything. I just went on 
to SparkNotes and half-
assed the assignment. In 
addition to these reports, 
we 
were 
also 
given 
the option to include a 
feedback portion at the 
end where we could write 
about our own thoughts 
and opinions on the book. 
The 
scammer 
residing 
inside 
my 
very 
soul 
obviously took the easy 
way out by forming the 
bulk of those book reports 
around what I thought 
of the books themselves 
since I obviously wasn’t 
going 
to 
provide 
any 
sort of detailed literary 
analysis or anything. To 
my surprise, Brush would 
leave a lot of her own 
feedback on the backs of 
my essays in addition to 
detailed critiques on my 
grammar and sentence 
structure. She offered me 
a lot of encouragement in 
these critiques too. She 
always told me to keep 
writing because there was 
something different and 
unique about my voice. 
I would later find out 
from friends that she was 
wondering what she could 
do to break me out of my 
shell and make me feel 
more comfortable with 
speaking out more, either 
in class or to her directly.
 See, the thing you 
really 
gotta 
know 
about Brush is that she 
understood people, often 
times without them even 
having to say a word. On 
top of all of that, she was 
explosive. Like an entire 
canister of Fourth of July 
fireworks going off all at 
once. She cursed like a 
sailor, but always made 
sure to blow her F-bombs 
away from the presence of 
administration...

 This is probably my 
third article on the lack 
of 
representation 
and 
positive representation of 
Black people in the world, 
but that just shows how 
much farther we have to 
go in our society to reach 
equal Black representation. 
Last weekend I had the 
opportunity to see the 
musical 
“Waitress”- 
it 
was my first time seeing a 
Broadway show in Chicago 
as all the ones I’d seen 
previously were in New 
York. I love theater and 
Broadway and was super 
excited to see my first show 
in Chicago.
 I went into the show 
blind, having no idea what 
the musical was going to 
be about, but I still loved 
it. The music, written 
by popular artist Sara 
Bareilles, was beautiful 
yet poppy and catchy. I 
enjoyed the modern-day 
storyline and the cute 
way the story was able to 
intertwine the motif of pies 
and baking throughout the 
show. But I’m not writing 
to comment on whether 
I liked the musical or not, 
because overall it was a 
great musical.
 As I watched the show, 
though 
I 
enjoyed 
it, 
something 
was 
still 
bothering me at the back 
of my mind, about race. 
It wasn’t that the entire 
audience 
watching 
the 
show was white. That 
was 
to 
be 
expected, 
and as a person being 
used to constantly being 
surrounded by only white 
people, 
it 
didn’t 
make 
me 
feel 
uncomfortable. 
It wasn’t the fact that 
the main characters and 

love interests were white, 
because that was also to be 
expected too.
 It was the roles the Black 
women 
were 
playing. 
Foremost, they were all 
supporting 
characters, 
but what upset me the 
most was that they were 
all just stereotypes. The 
main 
character 
was 
a 
30-something-year-old 
white 
woman 
named 
Jenna. Her best friend, 
Becky, was a large sassy 
Black woman who was 
always back talking and 
making 
sassy 
remarks 
to the amusement of the 
audience. 
The 
problem 
with this? She was just a 
caricature. The character 
she played was completely 
based 
off 
of 
all 
the 
stereotypes Black women 
try so hard to get away 
from. That we’re sassy, 
loud, rude and are always 
there with a comeback. 
Because 
shockingly 
enough, 
not 
all 
Black 
women are like that!!
 The only other prominent 
Black character in the 
show was the nurse who 
more or less fell into that 
same stereotype as sassy, 
always saying something 
smart and just a comic 
relief. Don’t get me wrong, 
the two women who played 
the parts were both great 
actresses 
and 
amazing 
singers as well as all-
around performers. But 
it was still disheartening 
to me to watch the show 
and know that as a Black 
woman trying to pursue 
theater, I would be limited 
to roles like these. That 
when I watch musicals, 
there are so many roles 
and characters I’d love to 

play but I’d never be able to 
because I’m not white. And 
I’m not talking about shows 
where the character has to 
be cast as someone who is 
white in order for the story 
to make sense contextually 
or historically. I mean roles 
where the character could 
probably be played by any 
race but I’d still never be 
given a chance to play it 
because I’m not white. 
So I’ll only be pushed to 
roles in which I’ll have 
to 
embody 
stereotypes 
that 
I’m 
otherwise 
working so hard to show 
the world that I, as well 
as other Black women, 
am 
more 
than. 
When 
I was younger I never 
consciously noticed things 
like this, as only seeing 
white representation was 
something that I was used 
to.
 There are musicals in 
which the majority of 
the cast are Black people 
and people of color, like 
“The Color Purple” and 
“Dreamgirls”, 
and 
it’s 
amazing to have those 
shows 
that 
feature 
so 
many Black artists and 
celebrate 
Black 
culture 
so beautifully. But I don’t 
want to have to have the 
mindset that if I want a 
lead in a show, I’ll have 
to be cast in one of those 
shows. I want to be able to 
play Jenna in “Waitress”, 
Heather 
Chandler 
in 
“Heathers”, 
Sophie 
in 
“Mamma Mia”, Rose in 
“Dogfight.” I don’t want 
to have to limit my dreams 
because of the color of 
my skin. I want to be 
appreciated as an actress 
because of my ability to 
play a character, not just 
fulfill a stereotype.

SPORTS

For many Americans, soccer 
is an ultimately illusive idea, a 
foreign phenomenon that the 
whole world has seemingly 
bought into and that has left 
America unaltered.
Citizens across the country 
watch 
the 
unmatched 
excitement surrounding events 
such as the World Cup or 
Champions League Final year 
after year with indifference. 
They see mega-stars such as 
Christian Ronaldo and Lionel 
Messi — two of the most 
popular 
human 
beings 
on 
planet Earth — and shrug off 
their fame. Enjoying soccer 
in America has been a niche 
pastime that has never been 
taken seriously.
But for some reason, that’s 
all begun to change.
For the first time in modern 
American 
history, 
soccer 
has 
gained 
real, 
tangible 
momentum in terms of its 
expansion 
into 
America’s 
golden sports market. All of a 
sudden, stadiums from Atlanta 
to Seattle are selling out Major 
League Soccer (MLS) games 
and 
the 
casual 
American 
sports fan is giving soccer a 
shot.
And helping lead the charge 
of spreading the world’s most 
popular sport into America 

is 
Michigan 
alum 
Daniel 
Sillman.
Sillman, 
only 
29, 
is 
currently serving as the Chief 
Executive Officer of Relevent 
Sports — a division of the live 
entertainment 
investment 
firm 
RSE 
Ventures 
that 
focuses on expanding soccer’s 
influence into the US and 
other untapped markets. Most 
notably, Relevent Sports hosts 
the International Champions 
Cup (ICC) every summer. The 
ICC serves as the flagship 
program for Relevent, seeking 
to entice American fans with 
the spectacle of European 
soccer and its stars.
“We’re 
seizing 
the 
opportunity 
in 
the 
marketplace,” Sillman said, 
“We see soccer as the biggest 
sport in the world and growing 
like crazy in America and Asia, 
and we feel that we’re best 
positioned to take advantage 
of the growth of the sport.”
While currently embracing 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
sport, 
Sillman’s 
journey 
did 
not 
begin in soccer. It didn’t even 
truly begin in sports.
At 
Michigan, 
Sillman 
studied finance at the Ross 
School 
of 
Business 
where 
he honed his analytic mind 
and eventually started his 
own 
business 
— 
Compass 
Management Group. Compass 
was a multi-family office for 

athletes 
and 
entertainers 
whose services ranged from 
accounting 
to 
estate 
and 
insurance planning.
Sillman’s staked interest in 
establishing Compass began 
through 
his 
relationship 
with 
former 
Wolverine 
football player and current 
Philadelphia Eagle Brandon 
Graham. Sillman began the 
business 
to 
help 
Graham 
out financially and use his 
newfound finance knowledge 
and increase his stock as an 
executive.
Before he knew it, Sillman’s 
company 
had 
taken 
off 
and was soon acquired by 
multi-family 
and 
business 
management firm FFO. As for 
Sillman, the Michigan grad 
served as an advisor for FFO 
while 
transitioning 
to 
his 
new position of Director of 
Business Development at RSE 
Ventures.
Throughout 
his 
short, 
yet storied career, Sillman 
has 
primarily 
operated 
in 
financial management, but he 
has found himself more and 
more entrenched in the realm 
of sports due to the clientele of 
his businesses.
While sports and athlete 
management have seemingly 
been the thread tying Sillman’s 
career together, another factor 
has blatantly helped the young 
executive achieve his success 

— 
the 
Michigan 
alumni 
network. After all, Sillman’s 
career did truly kick off due 
in part to his relationship with 
Graham.
Now, Sillman finds himself 
working for another Michigan 
man — legendary real estate 
developer and namesake of the 
business school Stephen Ross.
Ross owns RSE Ventures 
and continues to make deep 
investments 
into 
Sillman’s 
family of companies and is one 
of the early backers of soccer’s 
expansion into the states.
“The relationships I built 
at Ross School of Business 
are those that have really 
helped me my entire career,” 
Sillman said. “Ultimately, now 
I work for Steve Ross, so the 
alumni of the university have 
been relationships that I’ve 
been able to build through 
my experience at Ross and 
ultimately led to my career 
opportunities beyond selling 
my own business, but going 
to work at RSE Ventures, and 
now as the CEO of Relevent, 
working 
with 
so 
many 
Michigan alums has been a 
huge piece of my life.”
Now, Sillman is looking to 
use those connections and 
spin a miracle in soccer and 
other 
live 
entertainment 
opportunities in the states.
Beyond 
the 
men’s 
ICC, 
which most recently brought 
Manchester 
United 
and 
Liverpool to Michigan Stadium 
in front of a 100,000-plus 
person crowd, Sillman and co. 
have recently expanded into a 
women’s ICC, an ICC Future’s 
event at Disney’s Wide World 
of Sports Complex in Orlando, 
Fla. and an entertainment 
property 
called 
House 
of 
Soccer meant to inspire youth 
excitement around the sport.
While Sillman recognizes 
that 
these 
programs 
are 
undoubtedly 
a 
long-term 
investment 
into 
America’s 
future sporting landscape, he 
and his company are already 
seeing promising returns. By 
Sillman’s 
reports, 
Relevent 
affiliated 
sporting 
events 
garnered 140 million views 
last year and are on pace to 
reach as many as 160 million 
this 
year. 
Over 
a 
million 
people have attended their 
events in the past and with 
North America set to host the 
World Cup in 2026, Sillman 
firmly believes the sport is 
here to stay.

“To say, ‘Will it work?’ you 
gotta open your eyes because 
you have MLS which has 
been extremely successful,” 
Sillman said. “If you go study 
the media rights landscaping 
in North America, the English 
Premier League sold their 
media rights for $180 million 
to NBC which is double their 
last right’s sale.”
With a budding MLS and 
international stars coming to 
play stateside, it’s clear that 
America 
has 
the 
sporting 
infrastructure 
needed 
to 
support 
the 
world’s 
most 
popular 
sport. 
Now 
the 
question is whether Americans 
are ready to make the switch.
So how exactly do you make 
the pitch to the general public 
that soccer is worth the time?
Sillman says there exists a 
simple answer — storytelling.
“We do a lot to work with 
the clubs to tell the amazing 
stories behind the history 
of their formation and the 
success that they’ve had,” 
Sillman said. “We try to tell 
the stories of the mythical-like 
players and their stories and 
where they come from and how 
they’ve achieved success, and 
it’s our job to provide amazing 
entertainment 
experiences 
which is why we’ve developed 
House of Soccer which is 
very similar to NBA House 
of Hoops or NFL Experience 
at the Super Bowl, and we’ve 
expanded our investment off 
the pitch into entertainment 
properties that have really 
engaged 
the 
communities 
that we’re bringing to games 
so that people can participate 
with soccer.”
In the end, soccer still has a 
long way to go in dethroning 
the power four of football, 
basketball, 
baseball 
and 
hockey in America, but Sillman 
and Relevent seem to be taking 
all the right steps. They’re 
capitalizing off big spectacle 
events such as the World Cup, 
starting grass roots initiatives 
with kids camps and programs 
and 
are 
even 
organizing 
celebrity soccer games with 
such superstars as Drake and 
Draymond Green.
If 
currents 
trends 
hold 
and Sillman and Relevent, 
the 
silent 
workhorses 
of 
American 
soccer, 
continue 
their steadfast investment in 
the sport, it’s hard to imagine 
anything standing in their 
way.

State of soccer in USA

Waking up at 8.a.m on a 
weekend isn’t what most would 
consider normal. But that is the 
life of a soccer fan in the United 
States: watching the first half of 
a Premier League game on NBC 
Sports through groggy eyes before 
being woken up by a Mohamed 
Salah curler or Kevin De Bruyne 
screamer.
The International Champions 
Cup pays European clubs to play 
preseason games in America with 
the ultimate goal of growing the 
presence and importance of soccer 
in the United States. It wants to 
allow these fans to watch their 
favorite teams and players strut 
their stuff in person—and at 
normal hours of the day.
In the last four years, Michigan 
Stadium has held three such 
preseason friendlies: Manchester 
United - Real Madrid, Chelsea - 
Real Madrid, and now Liverpool 
- Manchester United. Each match 
gathered crowds north of 100,000, 
more than what is possible at any 
European stadium.
These fans came to watch 
Cristiano 
Ronaldo, 
Mohamed 
Salah, Paul Pogba and Eden 
Hazard, to name a few. They got 
mere glimpses of these superstars, 
sitting on the bench and warming 
up more than actually playing. 
They saw youngsters like Sheyi 
Ojo take penalties and coaches 
like Zinedine Zidane make eleven 
changes at half-time. But that’s 
pre-season.
“If I were them (the fans) I 
wouldn’t come,” said Manchester 
United coach Jose Mourinho. “I 
wouldn’t spend my money to see 

these (weakened) teams.
“For example, I was watching on 
television, Chelsea against Inter, 
and the people decided beach was 
better than this, and they went to 
the beach instead of going to the 
game. The stadium was empty.”
Mourinho echoes what many 
have fans been saying for a while. 
Last year, the ICC organized El 
Clasico in Miami: FC Barcelona 
vs Real Madrid CF. Tickets soared 
as high as $4,500. And then, 
Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t play, and 
Messi, Suarez and Neymar didn’t 
even last the full 90 minutes. 
Despite being a 3-2 thriller, it 
wasn’t a real El Clasico.
The venues don’t help the 
cause 
either. 
Despite 
being 
held in storied stadiums across 
America, more often than not, 
those stadiums weren’t designed 
for soccer games. Most games are 
held at NFL or College Football 
battlegrounds where the field is 
smaller than a regulation soccer 
pitch.
“A difficulty with the pitch is 
that, it is an American football 
pitch,” said Liverpool manager 
Jurgen Klopp. “So it is not that 
wide. It’s like you play in a very 
narrow way that makes football 
really not easy to play.”
The high price of tickets and the 
often sold out matches indicate 
that there are many fans in the 
United States passionate for soccer 
and desperate to watch their clubs 
play. In fact, over the course of 
the weekend, both United and 
Liverpool 
players 
repeatedly 
praised the atmosphere at the Big 
House.
“I 
think 
the 
passion 
that 
many Americans have for soccer 
deserves more,” Mourinho said. 

“It deserves the best teams. What 
creates passion is the quality (of 
soccer), good players, good teams, 
a good Liverpool - Manchester 
United. A good Manchester United 
- Real Madrid.”
But after a grueling World Cup, 
it is understandable why most 
teams aren’t able to play their 
starting lineups in these games. 
After all, they need them to be in 
perfect condition for the start of 
the new season.
According to Klopp, playing 
pre-season friendlies in America is 
less for growing the sport of soccer 
in the U.S, and more for giving to 
the fans that already exist.
“We alone are responsible for 
our fans and supporters all over 
the world.” Klopp said. “It (the 
Liverpool - Manchester United 
match) is not a commercial for 
football, it’s rather a show up for 
our supporters abroad, and that is 
what we like to do.”
“Its giving back to the fans 
that are here,” echoed breakout 
Liverpool 
left 
back 
Andrew 
Robertson. “Because there are 
supporters every weekend who 
get up early because of the time 
differences, and they get up and 
watch us. And for us to give them a 
small thing back, it’s a good thing 
to do.”
To their credit, Liverpool held 
an open training session at the 
Big House the day before the 
game. This gave the fans a chance 
to come watch them play and 
become more familiar with the 
players they support. Even some 
Manchester United fans in jerseys 
were seen at Liverpool training 
as their club didn’t offer anything 
similar.
After training, some fans went 
to the team hotel where they were 
greeted by players like Salah and 
were treated to a sing along with 
Klopp.
“It was amazing to see him in 
person,” said recent Michigan 
graduate Jamie Bahoura, one of 
the supporters at the hotel. “It 
shows how much he cares about 
us (the fans). He took time out 
of his busy schedule, and he was 
probably 
exhausted 
too 
after 
traveling, but he still made an 
effort to come down to see us and 
then join in on the singing which 
means a lot.”
Despite being more concerned 
with seeing existing Liverpool 
fans, Klopp did share his thoughts 
on the idea of expanding football 
in the United States.

Shaqiri stuns in his 
Liverpool debut at ‘M’

With eight minutes left in 
the game and Liverpool already 
up 3-1, Xherdan Shaqiri set 
Michigan Stadium alight on 
his Liverpool debut. With Ben 
Woodburn’s cross behind him, 
Shaqiri contorted his body, and 
in a show of pure athleticism, 
scored a bicycle kick that 
left even his fellow players 
stunned.
Having just signed for the 
club a week ago, no one thought 
Shaqiri would make such an 
impact from the get-go. Having 
been a star at the World Cup for 
Switzerland, his was a big name 
entering this game. However, 
even though his introduction 
to the game was 
well 
received, 
the 
man 
he 
replaced 
was 
Mohamed Salah, 
and 
people 
expected 
less 
excitement in the 
second half.
“It was better 
than 
I 
would 
have 
expected 
to 
be 
honest,” 
said Liverpool manager Jurgen 
Klopp. “That’s not normal after 
four days in the club, adapting 
that well to the style of play.”
His goal was just another 
stunner in Shaqiri’s collection 
of 
wonder 
goals. 
Another 
bicycle kick against Poland in 
2016, a chip against Everton in 
2015, and the list goes on really.
“I think I’m used to doing 
it 
(scoring 
wonder 
goals),” 
Shaqiri said. “I love bicycle 
kicks, and the ball was perfect, 
and why you shouldn’t try? 
I tried, and it was a very 
beautiful goal.”
Upon 
entering 
the 
field 
at halftime, Shaqiri showed 
boundless energy—constantly 
making runs in behind the 
back line, holding up play 
and creating space for his 
teammates.
One such run saw him get 
in 
behind 
the 
Manchester 
United 
backline 
and 
latch 
onto a longball played into 
the box. From there he held 
the ball between three United 
defenders, freeing up space for 

his teammates. He then played 
the ball to an on-rushing Daniel 
Sturridge who gave Liverpool 
the lead with their second goal 
of the game.
“We wanted to give him 
more 
freedom 
offensively,” 
Klopp said. “(He offers) runs in 
behind, and that’s what he did 
for the first goal in the second 
half.”
A goal and an assist on his 
unofficial debut against his 
club’s arch-rivals—not bad for 
a first week with the new club.
Shaqiri has been somewhat of 
a football journeyman, making 
a name for himself with FC 
Basel in the Champions League 
before being signed by Bayern 
Munich. 
After 
three 
years 
playing a bit part role at the 
Allianz 
Arena, 
he was with Inter 
Milan for part of 
a season before 
being shipped to 
Stoke City in the 
Premier League.
Once 
wanted 
by 
top 
clubs 
across 
Europe, 
occasional 
but 
inconsistent 
brilliance saw his 
stock drop. However, following 
another strong World Cup with 
Switzerland, Liverpool thought 
fit to buy him at a slashed price 
due to Stoke’s relegation.
Despite 
only 
being 
with 
the squad for a handful of 
days, it appears Shaqiri is 
working hard to settle in and 
make the most of his time at 
Liverpool, wanting to skip his 
holiday post-World Cup and 
begin training with the team 
immediately, 
according 
to 
Klopp.
“My first game for this big 
club, and with a beautiful goal, 
it’s more beautiful.” Shaqiri 
said. “It’s amazing to play with 
this great team, and you can see 
this team has amazing players. 
I’m excited (for the season).”
Because the game was still 
just a friendly, Shaqiri is yet 
to make his official debut for 
his new club. But if this is any 
indication of things to come, 
the most fearsome attack in 
Europe last season just got 
stronger.

The name of the game for both 
teams was pressure.
While there are little stakes in a 
preseason game — even in a rivalry 
matchup — the pressure exerted, not 
by the situation, but by the players on 
one another made the difference.
Squashing any remote chances 
created by Manchester United, 
Liverpool FC swarmed the midfield 
and controlled the pace of play for 
the majority of the first half. Any 
signs of a play created, despite the 
heroics of Manchester United’s 
Alexis Sanchez, were crushed by a 
Liverpool defensive line that would 
oftentimes double up on the man-to-
man coverage, making it hard for the 
forward as well as the midfielders to 
push.
The heavy press offered success 
on the offensive end by allowing 
Liverpool more possession time in 
the offensive zone. By forcing the 
turnovers on Manchester United’s 
side of the field, less was asked of 
the offensive end of the midfield and 
allowed the forwards all the room in 
the world to move — a strategy that 
allowed Liverpool to dominate the 
game against Manchester United in 
a 4-1 win.
The offensive pressure forced 
the Manchester United defense to 
respond. But while it did, it came 
only in high-danger situations. The 
defensive pressure was finally forced 
off Manchester United. However, it 
came off like a procrastinator would, 
carelessly, lazily and, often times, too 
late.
The last-minute effort by the 

defensive line worked during a few of 
the early scoring chances, diverting 
the passing lanes so that the passes 
were too far forward for Dominic 
Salanke or Mohammed Salah to 
garner within the box. Even when 
garnered, the stuffed box would be 
too crowded for a clear shot from the 
Liverpool forwards.
But as Liverpool caught on to 
the opportunities it was given, it 
made the most of the space allowed 
by the Manchester United defense 
to start a play. The time given was 
enough for the dynamic duo of Salah 
and forward Sadio Mane to force 
chances.
Around the five-minute mark, 
midfielder Rafa Camacho started 
the ball out with time to view for 
the open man. Spotting Mane, 
the pressure was then transferred 
toward the young forward, who’s 
offensive talents can’t be ignored, as 
the ball was passed to him. Opening 
the opportunity for Salah, the 
Egyption forward found himself by 
the near-post with no one in front of 
him. Ball at his feet and inches away 
from the goalline, Salah’s slight back-
heel tap went astray, and the ball was 
cleared and out of play.
The pressure from the attack 
didn’t 
stop 
from 
there. 
Salah 
continued his offensive onslaught 
with a header coming around nine 
minutes. The attack came amidst a 
crowd of three Manchester United 
defenders and seemingly caught 
the defense off guard, as his header 
went uncontested and sailed straight 
toward the top of the goal.
If it weren’t for the heroics of a 
last second touch by the Manchester 
United goalkeeper, who extended 

himself fully for the save, the score 
would have better reflected the 
dominant play by Liverpool to that 
point.
The breakthrough finally came at 
the 28th minute, as Liverpool finally 
found the payoff from its repeated 
offensive pressure, when Salah and 
Mane found one another to create 
a threat Manchester United just 
couldn’t settle. Forced into a bad 
position by his late contest, defender 
Demitri Mitchell gave in and fouled 
Salah at the baseline within the 
box — allowing Salah to draw the 
penalty.
Mane put an end to the open 
frames of the scoreboard and tacked 
on a point for Liverpool with a line 
drive to the left of the goal during the 
penalty kick.
Despite 
the 
wavering 
methodology 
that 
the 
defense 
had played with, the offense of 
Manchester United stayed true to 
what had created the little chances 
the team did generate — which were 
chances through counters.
Earlier in the game, Manchester 
United had seen its only other 
scoring opportunity from a counter 
that had opened the fast break. Even 
while Sanchez was falling down as 
he controlled the ball, he managed to 
lob it to an open man who found the 
back of the net but was ruled offsides.
Immediately 
after 
the 
score 
from Liverpool, Manchester United 
countered with a quick draw from 
the circle and a pass to midfielder 
Juan Mata, who redeemed his team’s 
performance by drawing a free kick 
just slightly outside of the box and 
within scoring distance.
With a creative shot toward the 
top left of the goal, in a curve ball, 
the score was evened by midfielder 
Andreas Pereira, and the momentum 
seemingly 
turned 
in 
favor 
of 
Manchester United for the first time. 
However, 
whatever 
momentum 
the team had garnered was quickly 
diminished through, again, the 
efforts of the Liverpool defense and 
midfield.
Where 
Manchester 
United’s 
midfield 
was 
unorganized 
and 
frustrated, 
Liverpool’s 
thrived 
through concise passing that didn’t 
settle with just winning a possession 
but turning it into a scoring 
opportunity.
While the halftime score was 
even, very few who watched the 
game could call Manchester United’s 
efforts on par with Liverpool’s. It 
was simply a one-sided affair. And 
the score showed that after the 
second half.

Liverpool and Manchester United faced off at the Big House in front of 100,000+

JACOB KOPNICK
Summer Managing Sports Editor

Mohammed Zakyi and Umar 
Farouk Osman stood at the 
first row of Michigan Stadium 
excitedly gazing out at the 
spectacle before their eyes.
It 
was 
the 
day 
before 
legendary 
English 
football 
clubs 
Liverpool 
and 
Manchester United were set 
to face off at the Big House, 
and Zayki and Osman came to 
watch the Meyersides practice. 
For 
the 
rising 
sophomores, 
it 
represented 
the 
ultimate 
goal: becoming a professional 
soccer player and achieving 
international fame. After all, 
a sizeable crowd had gathered 
just 
to 
watch 
the 
global 
powerhouses practice before a 
preseason friendly.
For Zayki, Osman and the rest 
of the Michigan men’s soccer 
team, this day had long been 
a big red X on their calendars. 
Not only will the experience of 
watching the best in the world 
matchup on their home turf 
instill a deep desire to reach 
the next level, but it will also 
serve as a unique learning and 
bonding opportunity for the 
team.
“When we heard about this 
two years ago, because we came 
here two years ago for our visit 
and we heard they were coming 
to play here, I was like, “Bro, 
that’s gonna be lit,” Zayki said. 
“So, we couldn’t wait to see 
them and hopefully tomorrow 
we get to see Manchester as 
well. Everyone’s excited to be 
here, all the soccer guys, so it’s 
gonna be great.”
More than just for the boys 
on the soccer team, Zayki 
hopes that having the two 
powerhouses face off in the 
United States will expand the 
influence of the world’s most 
popular sport to the states.
“For me, personally, I want 
Americans 
to 
see 
how 
big 
soccer is because soccer’s not 
really broadcasted really well 
here,” Zayki said, “so people 
coming out to see this game will 
motivate them to come more to 
see extra games and stuff, so 
it will just (make) Americans 

more 
aware 
of 
soccer 
in 
general.”
Added 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka Daley: “This is the third 
time we’ve hosted it at the 
University of Michigan, so our 
school certainly understands 
the importance of the game to 
the community, to Ann Arbor, to 
the state of Michigan, so that’s 
great, from that standpoint, and 
then our players and our staff 
understand the significance and 
the fortunate nature we have in 
hosting such world powers at 
our place, and the humility we 
gotta have by having the best 
of the best at our facilities, so 
we’re certainly excited about it 
and happy they’re here again.”
While Saturday’s spectacle 
will mostly be fun and games, 
Daley 
understands 
the 
necessary 
commitment 
one 
needs to make to the sport to 
find success. Therefore, while 
he and his staff will be sure 
to soak up the atmosphere at 
the clash of the titans, Daley 
sees this display as a learning 
opportunity as well.
“We come for the enjoyment, 
but you certainly take some 
things in — how the teams 
play, how they react, how they 
respond — there will be some 
high-level stuff in the sense 
of when coaches make certain 
changes, timing—they’re still in 
preseason, so you think about 
those things as well,” Daley 
said.
“You can learn one thing 
and that one thing can be 
the difference or be unique 
or interesting for your group 
that you can put your spin on 
because your coaching’s not 
necessarily… you don’t replicate 
others, it’s those adjustments 
that you make.”
In terms of playstyle and 
what exactly can be gleaned 
from these two clubs, Daley 
sees his program as a hybrid 
between 
the 
two, 
mixing 
Liverpool’s hard-hitting, fast-
paced offense with Manchester 
United’s stalwart defense.
But in terms of who he wants 
to win on Saturday, Daley 
made his motivations clear, 
responding, “Whoever I meet 
first.”
