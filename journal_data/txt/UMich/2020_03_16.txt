A confirmed case of the novel 

coronavirus 
(COVID-19) 
at 

the Vic Village-North student 

apartment building on Central 

Campus was announced by the 

leasing office in an email to 

residents Friday afternoon. It is 

the first case to be discovered at 

either student on-campus or off-

campus housing at the University 

of Michigan, though it remains 

unclear if the individual is a 

student. 

In the email, the leasing office 

reminded students of guidelines 

and recommendations from the 

Centers for Disease Control on 

minimizing exposure and spread 

of the virus.

“Now that we have a confirmed 

case, 
the 
guidelines 
and 

recommendations from the CDC 

relating to the coronavirus are 

even more pertinent,” the email 

reads.

Earlier 
Friday 
afternoon, 

University of Michigan President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
a 

University-affiliated 
individual 

had tested positive for COVID-19. 

According to the announcement, 

the individual is self-isolating in 

Ann Arbor. It is unclear whether 

that case is the same as the one 

confirmed in Vic Village. 

In its email to residents, Vic 

Village said it has contracted 

a third-party cleaning service 

to perform a deep cleaning of 

the building on Friday night. 

The usual cleaning service will 

also enhance its “normal daily 

cleaning 
protocol.” 
The 
Vic 

Village leasing office did not 

reply to request for comment in 

time for publication. 

On Friday morning, President 

Donald 
Trump 
declared 
the 

coronavirus outbreak a national 

emergency. There are currently 

25 confirmed COVID-19 cases 

in Michigan as of Friday night, 

including three in Washtenaw 

County. 

In a video posted online Friday, 

Jimena Loveluck, health officer 

at the Washtenaw County Public 

Health Department, discussed 

the status of the outbreak.

Despite numerous warnings from 

University of Michigan officials and 

public health authorities, some students 

still attended parties and went out 

to bars in the nights following the 

University’s decision to move classes 

online on Wednesday and in celebration 

of St. Patrick’s Day on Saturday. 

In response to the novel coronavirus 

(COVID-19) 
pandemic, 
President 

Donald Trump declared a national 

state of emergency Friday morning. 

The United States currently has more 

than 1,600 positive cases of the virus, 

including 33 in Michigan as of Sunday 

morning — with four in Washtenaw 

County, one of which was confirmed 

in the student apartment building Vic 

Village on Friday afternoon.

The official University Twitter 

account emphasized the importance 

of 
minimizing 
social 
gatherings 

in celebrating St. Patrick’s Day on 

Saturday night.

“Gathering socially in dense groups 

is not safe,” the tweet reads. “Please 

avoid large groups and confined 

spaces this weekend and in celebrating 

#StPatricksDay. We can lead by being 

responsible. #GoBlue!”

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
the 

Interfraternity 
Council 
and 
the 

Panhellenic 
Council, 
two 
groups 

overseeing 
many 
fraternities 
and 

sororities on-campus, suspended all 

social events, including those meant 

for St. Patrick’s Day, in light of the 

coronavirus outbreak. According to 

a statement shared with The Daily, 

these cancellations are due to the size 

of social events and the concern of 

disease transmission. 

LSA sophomore Sameer Matta, 

a member of the fraternity Alpha 

Tau Omega, said he agrees with the 

councils’ decision to cancel social 

events for the semester. 

“Sure, it’s a letdown at first, because 

(St. Patrick’s Day) is an event we all 

look forward to, especially people in 

Greek life,” Matta said. “But at the end 

of the day, it’s definitely much more 

important that we take initiative so 

the virus doesn’t spread anymore. 

And having a party would be a very 

prominent social gathering, so I think 

shutting it down was definitely the 

right thing to do.”

On his Twitter, Regent Jordan Acker 

(D) also encouraged students to avoid 

going to bars. In an interview with 

The Daily, Acker said he understands 

the disappointment students may 

feel regarding the cancellation of 

festivities. However, he emphasized 

the seriousness of the coronavirus 

situation.

“As someone who not that long ago 

would’ve longed to spend St. Patrick’s 

Day at Skeeps or Rick’s, I know that’s 

what students want to do right now,” 

Acker said.

initiating a wave of uncertainty and 

concern.

On March 5, four days before 

classes resumed from Spring Break, 

University President Mark Schlissel 

and Chief Health Officer Preeti 

Malani sent an email to the University

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The 
University 
of 

Michigan Central Student 

Government’s 
executive 

branch has transitioned 

its 
funds 
to 
support 

emergency 
resources 

within 
the 
University. 

While the weekly CSG 

Assembly meetings will 

now take place virtually, 

all future CSG executive 

programs and events have 

been canceled, according 

to 
a 
statement 
from 

President 
Ben 
Gerstein 

posted on social media 

Friday.

The 
announcement 

comes 
two 
days 
after 

University 
President 

Mark Schlissel announced 

classes will be held online 

beginning 
Monday 
due 

to the threat of COVID-

19. On Friday, Schlissel 

encouraged all students 

who are able to leave 

campus and return home. 

In 
his 
post, 
Gerstein 

recognized 
the 
mixed 

emotions 
students 
may 

feel about the University’s 

decision.

“Sometimes 
things 

come to an unexpected 

end,” Gerstein wrote. “As 

evidenced by this week, 

our lives can suddenly 

change and we are forced 

to adapt to unfamiliar 

situations. I know these 

last few days have brought 

significant 
uncertainty, 

anxiety, 
sadness, 
and 

fear 
to 
the 
University 

community. 
In 
times 

like these, we should not 

forget the strength our 

community 
possesses 

even if we are physically 

isolated from each other.”

In Gerstein’s Facebook 

post, he said the Executive 

Team 
has 
reallocated 

its 
budget 
to 
provide 

$10,000 to the Maize and 

Blue Cupboard, a food 

pantry based out of Betsy 

Barbour Residence Hall 

for students, and $10,000 

to the Dean of Students’ 

Student Emergency Fund, 

which is available for 

students facing unusual 

situations or hardships 

with a one-time monetary 

assistance of up to $500.

After 
noting 
the 

budget changes, Gerstein 

thanked 
the 
student 

body for allowing him 

to 
serve 
as 
president. 

He 
noted 
CSG’s 
work 

to 
ensure 
financial 

access and privacy for 

students seeking testing 

for sexually transmitted 

diseases 
or 
infections 

and 
its 
passage 
of 
a 

resolution calling for Big 

Ten schools to freeze 

fossil fuel investments, as 

well as the organization’s 

support 
for 
increasing 

mental health resources 

on campus and renewing 

a scholarship to mitigate 

monetary 
barriers 
to 

leadership.

“It has been an honor 

to be a partner in so many 

important 
movements 

driven by students on 

our 
campus,” 
Gerstein 

said. “There are endless 

other 
accomplishments 

and moments of progress 

I could name—and none 

of 
these 
would 
have 

been 
possible 
without 

the 
many 
students, 

organizations, 
and 

friends who contributed 

to these efforts.”

The 
CSG 
debate, 

originally scheduled for 

Wednesday evening, has 

been 
canceled. 
Spring 

elections for the executive 

branch 
and 
Assembly 

are still expected to take 

place online March 25-26.

Gerstein thanked the 

University 
community 

for the opportunity to 

help make changes to 

improve student life on 

campus. He said his work 

will continue until a new 

administration is elected.

“The list of individuals 

to thank is too extensive, 

but to everyone in CSG, 

and all students on campus 

who spend their hours, 

days, and weeks fighting 

for others: thank you for 

showing me what it looks 

like to strive for better, 

both as a leader and as a 

human being,” Gerstein 

wrote. “This unexpected 

closing to my term as CSG 

President is bittersweet. 

Thus far, this has been 

the 
greatest 
personal 

honor of my life, and I am 

forever grateful to those 

who trusted me with this 

responsibility. 
Although 

many of us might not be 

physically 
on 
campus, 

this work does not stop. I 

will continue supporting 

students 
through 
this 

challenging time until the 

next administration takes 

office.”

He 
also 
reminded 

students 
of 
the 

importance 
of 
keeping 

love and justice as central 

components 
of 
the 

University community. 

“To 
close, 
I’m 

constantly 
inspired 

by 
the 
late 
Reinhold 

Niebuhr’s quote: ‘Love is 

the motive, justice is the 

instrument,’” 
Gerstein 

wrote. “We are—and can 

always be —a community 

of love at Michigan, and 

one that diligently works 

towards justice.”

CSG President Ben Gerstein says the executive budget has been reallocated to emergency support services.


“The first cases of COVID-

19 in Washtenaw County have 

been 
confirmed,” 
Loveluck 

said. 
“These 
individuals 

remain isolated and have been 

working closely with the health 

department to identify close 

contacts and other lower-risk 

contacts so they can be notified, 

quarantined and alert to the 

possibility of symptoms.” 

COVID-19 symptoms include 

fever, 
cough 
and 
shortness 

of breath, which may appear 

two to 14 days after exposure. 

The virus is thought to spread 

through 
the 
respiratory 

droplets of those infected, so 

maintaining a distance of at least 

six feet between individuals is 

recommended. 

To 
prevent 
spreading 
the 

virus, the CDC recommends 

individuals wash their hands 

frequently and avoid touching 

their faces, advice that Loveluck 

reiterated. Those who are sick 

should stay home and wear a 

facemask. 
Unless 
caring 
for 

someone who is sick, CDC 

recommends against wearing a 

face mask if you are not sick. 

On Tuesday night, Whitmer 

announced 
the 
first 
two 

confirmed cases in Michigan and 

declared a state of emergency. 

In 
response, 
the 
University 

canceled classes for two days 

on Wednesday afternoon and is 

moving to online classes starting 

Monday, March 16 until the end 

of the semester. 

All spring and summer study 

abroad 
programs 
have 
been 

called off, and the University 

has begun recalling all students 

currently 
abroad. 
Spring 

Commencement 
was 
also 

canceled. 

Both the University and state 

government have implemented 

rules 
to 
encourage 
social 

distancing. 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer issued an executive 

order 
banning 
all 
events 

with more than 250 people 

in Michigan until April 5 on 

Friday morning. The University 

has banned all events with 

more than 100 people, though 

Schlissel 
emphasized 
in 
his 

email on Friday that all social 

gatherings 
in 
large 
groups 

should be avoided. 

“We strongly encourage you 

to limit interactions in groups 

this weekend and in celebrating 

St. 
Patrick’s 
Day,” 
Schlissel 

wrote. “Reducing the density 

of people in physical spaces 

will help to prevent the spread 

of disease not just within our 

community but for society at 

large. Even in small groups, we 

strongly recommend practicing 

social distancing.”

Additionally, 
the 
city 
of 

Ann Arbor canceled all city-

permitted events expecting 50 

or more people on Thursday 

afternoon. 

In his email Friday afternoon, 

Schlissel 
encouraged 
all 

students who are able to return 

home to do so. For students 

who stay on campus, University 

residence halls and dining halls 

will remain open. 

Other 
institutions 
in 
the 

state, 
including 
Michigan 

State 
University, 
Washtenaw 

Community 
College, 
Central 

Michigan University and Wayne 

State 
University, 
have 
also 

transitioned 
to 
online-only 

classes. 

Additionally, 
on 
Thursday 

afternoon, 
Whitmer 
ordered 

the closure of all Michigan K-12 

schools until April 5. 

To help those in need of aid 

during 
the 
rapidly-evolving 

coronavirus outbreak, a group 

of 
students 
and 
organizers 

have 
gathered 
resources 
of 

community-sourced 
options 

for housing, food, health care, 

transport, 
emotional 
support 

and more. 

Local businesses have also 

moved to help people whose 

lives have been disrupted by the 

outbreak. Starting on Monday, 

TeaHaus will also be handing 

out free boxed lunches to school-

aged children at their sister 

location on 211 E. Ann Street. 

Daily News Editor Claire Hao 

can be reached at cmhao@umich.

edu.

The 
email 
included 
details 

regarding 
relaxing 
documentation 

requirements and grade penalties for 

students missing class, as well as self-

isolation tips, illness prevention and 

campus preparation.

Public Health senior Josie Lee, 

president of Curis Public Health 

Advocacy, said she was concerned 

with the initial response the University 

issued to students returning from 

Spring Break.

“(From) studying public health, we 

see that we can save a lot more money 

if we’re preventative than if we’re 

reactionary,” Lee said. “I’m kind of 

surprised, I felt like knowing that this 

was happening in the U.S., and knowing 

the potential that Spring Break could 

have in bringing the virus to Michigan, 

I’m surprised that the University didn’t 

take 
better-standardized 
protocol 

or tell their faculty how they could 

prepare — maybe even making them 

have plans with how they could move 

their courses online.”

Public 
Health 
senior 
Emily 

Benedict shared similar sentiments. 

She worried about the spread of 

COVID-19 following Spring Break, 

considering many students traveled to 

areas affected by the virus.

“In my mind, it’s very unlikely that 

no one came back from spring without 

an outbreak in their system,” Benedict 

said. “I just feel like having classes 

those few days potentially allowed 

for it to spread. I feel like maybe over 

spring break there should have been 

more preparation and discussion 

knowing people are going to be coming 

back from areas that may have had the 

virus.”

On Friday afternoon, a case of 

COVID-19 was confirmed in student 

apartment building Vic Village-North 

on Central Campus through an email 

sent to residents by the leasing office.

Upon return from Spring Break, 

Lee said she felt her classes were not 

affected by the precautionary measures 

the University recommended in the 

email. She noted the limited actions 

her classes took and the potential for 

students to not follow self-isolation 

protocols.

“I think the warnings from the 

school, just the emails that we got from 

the provost, the deans of our schools 

or the president — it was something 

that I wonder if it was enough,” Lee 

said. “When I was going to my classes, 

some of my classes didn’t even entirely 

mention how they were going to 

handle the situation, or they didn’t 

even discuss it, and I feel like some of 

the people in those areas might not 

have self-isolated, and there might 

not have been proper protocols, so I 

feel like the warning the school gave 

to the students might have not been as 

explanatory, or telling, of why it was 

important.”

“But the reality is, even if students 

themselves may not get really sick, 

some will, and even more could 

be carriers of this disease … and 

pass it along to people who are 

immunocompromised, their parents, 

their grandparents. So even if they 

don’t feel the effects, gathering in these 

spaces, we’ve seen is one of the biggest 

ways this disease is spread.”

On Saturday night, Engineering 

student Adam Scott went to Rick’s 

American Cafe to celebrate St. Patrick’s 

Day weekend. Scott said he thinks 

the low risk of serious illness for 

young people who contract COVID-19 

contributes to students coming to bars 

against public health recommendations. 

“Clearly this is probably a bad idea, 

but I think most people don’t care 

because it’s a very selfish attitude,” Scott 

said. “They don’t think they’re going to 

get sick and they really don’t care how it 

affects others.”

Rick’s management did not respond 

to The Daily’s request for comment in 

time for publication.

COVID-19 is considered highly 

contagious and thought to be spread 

via 
infected 
respiratory 
droplets. 

Therefore, the Centers for Disease 

Control recommends keeping at least 

six feet of distance between individuals. 

The CDC also encourages social 

distancing, in which people avoid large 

social gatherings. By implementing 

these preventative techniques, national, 

state and local governments hope to 

avoid an influx of patients at health 

care facilities, a phenomenon that has 

crippled other countries, such as Italy, 

in their ability to contain and treat the 

disease. 

On Sunday evening, the CDC also 

recommended 
the 
cancellation 
or 

postponement 
of 
events 
bringing 

crowds of 50 people or more for the next 

eight weeks.

Faye Mendelson, Michigan Medicine 

employee and University alum, also 

went out to Rick’s Saturday night to 

reunite with old classmates. Mendolson 

told The Daily she thought her personal 

health risk of going to a bar was low.

“I feel like people should take it 

seriously and they should be safe,” 

Mendelson said. “They should take it as 

if it’s not just going to affect them, but 

it’s going to affect the people around 

them and the people that they’re close 

to, either family, friends of family or 

so forth. But at the same time, I don’t 

feel like we should completely close 

ourselves off from the world. Just be 

smart about it.”

To prevent the spread of the virus, the 

University and other colleges in the state 

and across the nation have transitioned 

to online classes for the remainder of 

the semester. Multiple emails Friday 

and Saturday from University President 

Mark Schlissel, other administrators 

and University offices have urged 

students to leave campus if they are able 

to do so. All University spring and study 

abroad programs have been canceled 

and the University is recalling students 

currently abroad. 

All University events expecting 

more than 100 people have been 

banned, leading to the cancellation of 

Spring Commencement, the NCAA 

tournament and all spring and winter 

sporting competitions, among other 

events. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has 

banned all events larger than 250, while 

the City of Ann Arbor has canceled all 

events expecting more than 50. 

For LSA senior Caelen Caspers, 

Rick’s and other bars hold emotional 

significance as places where friends have 

always met and enjoyed themselves. 

However, she stayed away from what 

she described as huge crowds at Rick’s, 

especially earlier in the week, when she 

said many students saw canceled classes 

as an opportunity to party.

“There’s a person at Vic Village who 

has (COVID-19), and I didn’t go to Rick’s 

on Thursday, but I guarantee they did,” 

Caspers said. “I hope they didn’t, but if 

they did, how do you not infect people in 

that proximity?”

The Washtenaw County Sheriff’s 

Office has also prohibited all events 

larger than 250 and discouraged 

events larger than 100. It recommends 

canceling gatherings larger than 10 

if there is someone with higher risk 

of severe illness involved. Failure to 

follow the order could be subject to a 

misdemeanor, resulting in up to 90 days 

in jail and/or a $200 fine. 

At a press conference on Sunday 

afternoon, Attorney General Dana 

Nessel said bars and restaurants could 

face a state-mandated shutdown or lose 

their liquor license if they do not comply 

with Whitmer’s order. She particularly 

referred to businesses having St. 

Patrick’s Day celebrations. 

“We’re hoping that no one has to be 

cited,” Nessel said. “Most proprietors in 

the industry are good actors and want 

to ensure the safety of their patrons 

and employees,” Nessel said. “But in the 

event there are some bad apples, we are 

prepared to enforce the law.”

Along with going to popular local 

bars, many students held their own 

large gatherings. Several houses near 

Central Campus hosted parties during 

the day on Saturday.

LSA sophomore Faye Polasek did not 

go to any parties or bars herself, but said 

she saw numerous house parties while 

driving down Hill Street during the day 

on Saturday.

“I passed tons of people in St. Patrick’s 

Day gear — like the whole darty getup,” 

Polasek said. “At basically every corner, 

people were walking places along the 

strip of Hill from Packard to South 

Forest. And then on my street where I 

live on South Forest, I saw multiple large 

house parties of people on the porches 

and the lawns, making me think there’s 

probably lots of people in the house 

as well. Same thing — all green for St 

Patrick’s Day.”

Polasek also noted she saw people 

visit other local bars such as Good Time 

Charley’s and The Brown Jug over the 

past week.

However, 
other 
students 
are 

emphasizing the importance of adhering 

to public health recommendations. On 

Friday, LSA junior Carolyn Chen posted 

one of several memes in the UMich 

Memes for Wolverteens Facebook 

group directed at students who were 

partying. Her post, with a picture of 

“hard to swallow pills” and a caption 

saying “your social life and (fear of 

missing out) is not worth risking the 

lives of other people,” has almost 1000 

likes.

Chen said she made the post because 

she was disappointed seeing many of 

her friends and others on social media 

go to bars and host large parties.

“A few days ago, I’ve just been seeing 

a lot of my friends and all over social 

media, people going out to clubs, parties, 

hanging out with their friends, selfies of 

everyone being really close together, not 

the six feet apart of social distancing,” 

Chen said.

Chen said she finds it frustrating 

that even students who are aware of 

the public health rationale of affecting 

vulnerable populations choose to go out.

“It’s such a privilege to be young and 

to not have to care whether or not you 

get impacted by the virus because you 

think you’re going to be fine,” Chen 

said. “It’s funny to me, I see people post 

‘Flatten the curve’ on their story, and 

then they’ll literally be at Rick’s that 

night, and I’m just like ‘what?’” 

Chen said she sympathizes with 

senior students, who have had their 

time left in college with their friends 

cut short. However, Chen said the 

coronavirus pandemic is too serious to 

ignore.

“I sympathize with the seniors, I’m 

not invalidating how sad it must be,” 

Chen said. “But I’m saying it’s even 

sadder to lose a loved one or lose your 

own life, and that is what is at stake 

here.”

Chen hypothesized that students may 

not be taking public health guidelines 

seriously because Michigan’s COVID-19 

cases were so recent. However, she still 

said she thinks large social gatherings, 

such as big house parties and crowded 

bars, are unacceptable. 

“To me, I think it’s a really, really 

selfish thing to do,” Chen said. “I get that 

it’s scary and that people don’t want to 

change the way they live, but sometimes 

you need to change the way you live 

in order to protect or help the rights 

of other people. And the right to live is 

definitely a right.”

The Centers for Disease Control 

recommends people wash their hands 

often and avoid touching their eyes, 

nose and mouth.

Symptoms of coronavirus include 

fever, cough and shortness of breath. 

Anyone who believes they have been 

exposed to COVID-19 should call their 

health care providers or the nearest 

hospital.

SOCIALIZING
From Page 1


There isn’t much that hasn’t 

already been said about the power 

of voting. In a society in which 

many aspects of our livelihoods 

aren’t 
controlled 
by 
us, 
it 
is 

important that we at least have a 

say on who is allowed to lead our 

nation. As citizens of the U.S., 

we aren’t necessarily given the 

chance to determine the future of 

healthcare policy or the allocation 

of public school funding. Casting 

our vote is the only way we can 

ensure that our interests are taken 

into consideration when decisions 

are being made that directly affect 

our lives. While the importance 

of voting needs to be constantly 

reiterated, it is a topic that is heavily 

discussed. What deserves more 

attention is the power of the Black 

vote specifically.

As the current election cycle 

continues to unfold, the ability of 

13% of the population to control 

the results of the Democratic 

presidential campaigns has become 

increasingly clear. In recent months, 

both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders 

have 
experienced 
devastating 

lows and unexpected highs in 

the polls, and four candidates — 

Tom Steyer, Pete Buttigieg, Mike 

Bloomberg, and Kamala Harris 

have ended their campaigns. All of 

these phenomena have at least one 

common denominator—they were 

influenced by how these candidates 

were perceived by Black voters. For 

the bulk of 2019, and even some 

of 2020, Biden’s kryptonite was 

young Black voters. His stance on 

bussing, his revealed lack of support 

for Anita Hill in her sexual assault 

case against Clarence Thomas, and 

his blaming of Black mothers for 

the racial achievement gap caused a 

rocky foundation for his campaign. 

However, the South Carolina polls, 

which are made up largely of Black 

voters, revived Biden’s chances 

in the same way they devastated 

Buttigieg and Steyer’s. And as for 

Kamala Harris, her questionable 

stances on issues that are most 

pertinent to Black voters, as well as 

her perceived lack of authenticity 

when it came to her comments on 

racial justice, led to her slowed 

momentum 
and 
decreased 

availability of funds. In the past 

six months, the ability of the Black 

vote to be either the kiss of death 

or the source of life for any given 

campaign has become increasingly 

clear. There is no denying the power 

of the black vote.

The only thing left to happen is 

for the people with this power to 

take advantage of it. Historically, 

this hasn’t been seen as a viable 

option. 
This 
country’s 
track 

record of disenfranchisement and 

discriminatory 
voting 
practices 

has, understandably, stolen our 

community’s 
sense 
of 
hope. 

However, as contradictory as this 

may seem, utilizing this system is 

the only way to stop it from abusing 

us. Voting in people who represent 

us and our values is one of the best 

things we can do to create a system 

that works more for our benefit. 

Even as the Democratic primaries 

come to a close, this message 

remains important. It is one that 

extends to every political office that 

we are able to vote on, from the local 

level to the national level. There is 

power in the Black vote, and it needs 

to be harnessed.

On March 10, five states held 

their primaries (Idaho, Michigan, 

Mississippi, 
Missouri 
and 

Washington), while North Dakota 

held their Democratic caucuses. 

As a first time voter, I made sure to 

plan out when I was going to stand 

in line to exercise my right to vote — 

after attending the Bernie Sanders’ 

rally on Sunday, I felt even more 

empowered to let my voice be heard 

on that day because I had faith in my 

peers to “fight for someone that they 

didn’t know”. 

But in this spirit of excitement 

to vote, I couldn’t help but think 

about what my vote meant today; a 

topic which was on my mind heavily 

this election cycle was in regards 

to what is being done to address 

the current Black maternal health 

crisis (while also thinking about 

access to quality healthcare services 

that include family planning and 

reproductive health). Some past 

potential Democratic presidential 

candidates such as Kamala Harris, 

Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and 

Kirsten Gillibrand have introduced 

legislation to address this issue. 

Numbers do not lie: Black women 

are three to four times more likely to 

die during childbirth from pregnancy-

related complications than white 

women; the United States has some 

of the worst maternal mortality 

rates in the developed world. And 

Black women are twice as likely to 

lose an infant to premature death. 

Further, the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention reports that 

60% of the 24.6 deaths per 1,000 

live births are preventable. These 

figures have also been adjusted for 

education and income. Maternal 

mortality disproportionately affects 

Black women and should not be 

taken at face-value — racial health 

disparities and patient-doctor trust 

are some of the main factors that 

contribute to this crisis. The pain 

Black women may report to their 

healthcare providers may not be 

taken seriously or downplayed. 

Most importantly, the structural 

systems of racism Black women have 

to navigate daily in the workplace 

and public spaces can take a toll on 

their physical health. 

Luckily, a group of legislators 

acted on this racial health disparity 

and made history today. 

The 
Black 
Maternal 
Health 

Caucus was created in the United 

States Congress by Reps. Lauren 

Underwood (D-Ill) and Alma Adams 

(D-N.C.) back in April of 2019 to 

address this crisis; the caucus has 

grown to hold 75 members. And 

today these members made history 

for the future of Black maternal 

health through the introduction 

of nine bills to the U.S. House of 

Representatives - the Black Maternal 

Health Momnibus Act of 2020. This 

Act is a set of comprehensive bills 

that “aims to fill gaps in existing 

legislation to improve the health 

outcomes for Black moms who are 

dying at three to four more times the 

rate of their White counterparts.” 

The goal of these bills center on 

the care of Black mothers, so that 

they receive “comprehensive, and 

culturally-competent care”; Reps. 

Underwood expressed at a press 

conference that the Black maternal 

health crisis is a national priority. 

A summary of what the legislation 

entails can be found on Reps. Lauren 

Underwood’s website. 

Black maternal health is an issue 

that will have to continue to be 

addressed in all levels of government 

as well as in classroom settings 

centered around Public Health, 

Policy, Psychology, Women’s Studies 

and many other disciplines to stir up 

healthy dialogue. In the meantime, 

hopefully 
the 
Black 
Maternal 

Health Momnibus Act 2020 will 

bring real change to how healthcare 

is provided and create safe spaces 

in the healthcare industry for Black 

mothers.

The Black Maternal Health Crisis: The Beginning of An End 

I became hip to Noname’s Book 

Club this past summer. Noname, a 

rapper and organizer from Chicago, 

started a book club to uplift voices 

of color by highlighting two books 

each month for online and in person 

community 
members 
to 
read. 

February was the first time I was 

able to read along. I choose to read 

a collection of poems by Morgan 

Parker called “Magical Negro”. 

I’ve always loved to read books, 

especially work written by Black 

people but poetry is a whole other 

realm for me. I feel as if some poems 

go over my head and I have to read 

over and over until I force meaning 

out of it. I felt that way about some 

of the poems in “Magical Negro” but 

the majority of them I could relate on 

a level I didn’t realize would connect 

with me, especially pertaining to my 

experiences as a Black woman.

One poem in particular titled 

“Now More Than Ever” really struck 

a chord with me. Parker writes about 

the way in which people use the 

saying, “now more than ever” to talk 

about social issues and politics. This 

phrase has been utilized so regularly 

by the privileged after 2016. They 

say, “Now more than ever, it is 

important that we stand together 

to fight against hate” or “Now more 

than ever, we have to uplift the most 

marginalized,” and so on. I’m tired 

of hearing this bullshit.

So many people have obliviously 

walked through the world thinking 

things were getting better, more 

tolerant, and accepting. Clinging so 

dearly onto the Obama presidency 

and the legalization of gay marriage 

while turning a blind eye on the 

increases of deportations, lead-

poisoned water in Flint, MI, and 

the lack of administrative change 

being done to stop police violence 

towards Black citizens. Activists of 

color, especially Black activists and 

organizers have been saying these 

things for decades.

SHAD JEFFREY II | COLUMN

Are we ready for a socialist reality?

T

housands of students, myself 

included, flocked to the Diag 

on Sunday, March 8 to witness 

and participate in the campaign rally 

of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Attendees 

were urged to rush to the polls to 

support Sanders in Tuesday’s Michigan 

primary in his attempt to be nominated 

as the Democratic Party’s candidate, 

the candidate to run against President 

Donald Trump in the general election.

Sanders, and his preceding speakers 

at the rally, had a common set of beliefs 

and all called for free — or at least 

heavily subsidized — housing, health 

care and college education. These 

ideals are commonly characterized as 

socialist in nature as they involve the 

nationalization and substantial takeover 

of what are chiefly private industries. 

As a result, one could consider Sanders 

and his supporters to be “socialist.”

The generation of my parents, and 

anyone who lived during the “socialist 

experiment” that was the Soviet Union, 

may have a different perspective on the 

hopefulness of Sanders’s campaign. 

While the ideals Sanders speaks about 

are utilitarian, the world has already 

witnessed the messy collapse of such 

a system and how the implementation 

of state socialism failed to provide the 

quality of life it promised in Eastern 

Europe. The world’s experience with 

socialism left a bad taste in their mouths. 

I can only speak from my experience 

as an American growing up in the 

conservative state of Indiana, but the 

words “communism” and “socialism” 

were associated with treason. To doubt 

the status quo, or to even be curious 

about different modes of political 

governance or economic regulation, 

was un-American — and frankly wrong. 

The generations that came before 

mine lived through socialism and saw 

its pitfalls, human rights violations 

and authoritarian nature. Whether 

they recognized the Soviet Union’s 

idealistic aims, or whether they now 

recognize that the United States is in 

a more technological, economical and 

ethical advantageous position than the 

Soviet Union was at its onset, they saw 

a failed experiment and the devastation 

of millions of repressed people. That 

undoubtedly shapes their view and their 

optimism for such ideals.

The 
political, 
economic 
and 

technological 
climate 
of 
modern 

America is vastly different than the 

post-World War II Soviet Union satellite 

states, but the experience of witnessing 

the failure of socialism has been enough 

to dissuade older generations from 

considering Sanders’ ideals. Socialism 

(and by extension socialist ideals) is 

considered to be “post-capitalist” in 

that its implementation requires a 

highly developed and technologically 

advanced market economy to then 

subsequently 
nationalize. 
We 
are 

currently living in such a society, with 

increasing levels of automation to work 

for the benefit of the people and with 

the amount of compiled wealth among 

the nation’s top one percent. 

A new generation of socialists, or 

so-called “democratic socialists,” may 

have been born, but America isn’t 

ready for a president like Sanders yet. 

He is ahead of his time, but the role he 

is playing in opening people’s minds 

and creating a sense of hope and 

urgency for a political revolution is not 

to be undersold — his contribution is 

invaluable. The population isn’t ready 

for such dramatic change yet, but it will 

be interesting to observe the political 

trends of the generations to come and to 

see just how left American politics lean 

as my generation transitions toward 

being middle-aged. The saying goes 

that people get more conservative as 

they age, that the burning liberalism 

and anarchical view of the status quo 

fade as the years tack on, so the socialist 

reality may never come to fruition if 

the generation whom Sanders largely 

appeals to doesn’t stay the course.

I

n the past two months, 

novel 
coronavirus 

(COVID-19) has caused 

an outbreak of mild to severe 

respiratory disease in over 144 

locations worldwide, including 

the United States. On Jan. 30, 

coronavirus was declared a 

public health emergency by 

the World Health Organization 

(WHO). 
Since 
then, 
the 

virus has reached pandemic 

proportions with over 125,000 

reported 
cases 
and 
4,600 

deaths.

It 
is 
impossible 
to 
be 

completely prepared for public 

health emergencies like this. 

Admitting to this, though, is 

the first step to executing a 

quick and effective response. 

The 
Centers 
for 
Disease 

Control (CDC) has focused on 

developing 
and 
distributing 

test kits, providing epidemic 

response 
guidance 
and 

monitoring the virus. It has 

emphasized the importance of 

the federal government’s key 

role as a communicator between 

state and local partners, public 

health institutions and health 

departments. 
In 
response 

to the coronavirus, the U.S. 

administration 
has 
instead 

provided potentially misleading 

information that contradicts 

many public health institutions 

and experts. 

President Donald Trump’s 

constant 
downplay 
of 
the 

pandemic has failed to reassure 

Americans (and raises criticism 

for his public communication of 

the crisis). During an interview 

with Fox News, Trump said, 

“Now, this is just my hunch, but 

based on a lot of conversations 

with a lot of people … personally, 

I would say, the number (death 

rate) is way under 1 percent.” 

In contrast, WHO estimates a 

death rate of 3.4 percent based 

on the number of deaths and 

people who have been tested. 

Public health experts have noted 

that due to a lack of information 

about the virus, incomplete 

testing and reporting the crude 

death rate remains unknown. 

Trump’s history of distrust 

in 
scientific 
evidence 
and 

subsequent condemnation of the 

media questions the credibility 

of his “hunch.”

Last week, Trump put Vice 

President Mike Pence in charge 

of the U.S.’s response to the 

coronavirus. Pence announced 

that any American could get 

tested for coronavirus with 

health insurance coverage. He 

stated there would be 2,500 test 

kits available with the capacity 

to test one million individuals 

and an additional one million 

tests would be manufactured in 

the coming week. In reality, only 

certain public health labs have 

the resources to accommodate 

the initial testing demand after 

delays in test manufacturing. 

These labs have administered 

fewer than 100 tests a day, 

amounting to significantly less 

than the one million predicted. 

With the rapid increase in virus 

cases, especially in densely 

populated states like California 

and New York, testing demand 

has heightened. Public health 

labs all around the country not 

only lack the resources but also 

the capacity to conduct testing.

In addition, in early February, 

Trump eliminated the global 

health unit of the National 

Security Council and instead 

proposed various programs and 

budget cuts because he believed 

the unit was not necessary. 

Tom Inglesby, director of the 

Johns 
Hopkins 
Center 
for 

Health Security, commented 

on this by saying, “You build a 

fire department ahead of time. 

You don’t wait for a fire. There 

is an underappreciation for the 

amount of time and resources 

required to build a prepared 

system.” It is, in fact, almost 

impossible to reassemble an 

institutional unit such as this 

during an ongoing crisis. The 

result: The U.S. is not 

prepared for this pandemic. 

Pence’s 
empty 
promises 

of 
preparedness 
and 
the 

misrepresentation 
of 
the 

U.S.’s 
response 
capabilities 

reflects a lack of experience 

in responding to public health 

emergencies 
and 
his 
poor 

public health record as former 

Indiana governor. Pence’s role 

in this response is more akin 

to “a political damage control” 

for 
Trump 
than 
a 
public 

health 
emergency 
response. 

The 
administration’s 
poor 

communication 
both 
among 

health 
institutions 
and 
to 

the public has resulted in the 

hindrance of U.S. response 

efforts. 

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading 

infectious disease public health 

expert who led U.S. response to 

SARS, HIV, MERS and other 

outbreaks, has been correcting 

Trump’s 
recent 
assessment 

of the crisis. He believes that 

“... the public needs solid, 

understandable 
medical 

information, especially during 

crises.” When responding to an 

emergency such as this, federal 

governments need to be: “... 

encouraging calm, providing 

key information and leading an 

assertive response.” 

While Trump has stressed 

that Americans should “remain 

calm,” 
his 
communication 

and response to this crisis 

have 
not 
provided 
any 

reassurance to the public. In 

fact, the administration’s lack 

of transparency in terms of 

making informed decisions and 

communicating to the public 

has 
impeded 
our 
response 

to this crisis. Public health 

experts 
like 
Fauci 
should 

be the spokespeople during 

epidemics. They understand 

that what needs to happen 

is a public health response, 

not 
a 
political 
cleanup 

effort. What’s important to 

Americans, like you and me, 

is faith in our administration 

in their ability to promise and 

deliver. It is a necessity that 

our representatives must have, 

especially 
during 
times 
of 

crisis.

Trump’s response to pandemic is far from reassuring

T

hank you for the Feb. 18 article 

headlined “Students opt to take 

math classes outside of the 

University” in which you describe some of 

the issues with STEM and mathematics 

courses at the University and the complex 

set of considerations students navigate in 

deciding whether to take required courses 

at the University or to transfer credit from 

other institutions. We are acutely aware 

of the financial pressures that your article 

highlight, and sympathetic with the goal 

of lessening one’s course load during the 

regular term.

However, we are concerned that none 

of the individuals you quoted in the article 

have first-hand knowledge of the courses 

about which they were speaking. It is 

difficult for your reporting to be factual 

when all of the reasons students give 

for taking mathematics courses at other 

institutions, save the concerns of cost or 

course load, are based on hearsay. Students 

may hear that “Michigan math is just the 

worst,” especially when this is printed in 

your article, but if your goal as a newspaper 

and reporter is to be factual and objective, 

you should have some support for the 

assertion beyond unsubstantiated claims 

from students who have never actually 

taken the courses in question.

We agree that there is room for 

improvement in the instruction in all units at 

the University, which includes mathematics. 

At the same time, however, the Department 

of Mathematics works hard to ensure that 

our students learn as much as possible in 

our courses. There are many aspects of our 

program that are recognized nationally 

as being best practices in mathematics 

instruction. Moreover, we are currently 

working with the University’s Center for 

Research on Learning and Teaching and the 

College of Literature, Science & the Arts to 

improve the assessment in our introductory 

courses and the support that we provide 

our instructors. At the end of the day, our 

goal is for students to learn mathematics 

at a deep and fundamental level. Learning 

at this level is not easy, but we believe that 

goal is the core of the University’s mission 

as an elite academic institution. We believe 

that Michigan students can succeed at this 

level, and that rising to the challenge is the 

best preparation to gain the knowledge and 

tools to ensure their success when they 

graduate and take on the challenges of the 

world.

KRISTEN MOORE | LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Addressing the difficult reputation of STEM courses


Monday, March 16, 2020 — 6

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Identical twins are one of nature’s most 

fascinating wonders. Two offspring, born of the 

same pregnancy, who look exactly alike; one 

can’t help but compare one sibling to the other. 

To scientists, twins offer a unique research 

opportunity that is too good to pass up, and they 

have therefore been an integral component to 

researching the effects of nature versus nurture. 

In one famous yet ethically questionable study, 

three twins who were separated at birth were 

studied to explore how deeply their similarities 

ran when each sibling was raised in a completely 

different environment. 

Brit 
Bennett’s 
upcoming 
novel 
“The 

Vanishing Half” offers a new take on the study 

of twins, using twin characters to explore 

the controversial topic of racial passing. The 

novel follows Stella and Desiree, the identical 

Vignes 
twins, 
a 

once 
inseparable 

pair who ultimately 

chooses to live in 

two 
completely 

different 
worlds. 

As 
16-year-olds, 

the 
twins 
are 

able to escape the 

restrictive confines 

of 
their 
tiny 

“colorstruck” Black 

community 
called 

Mallard and make their own way in the world. 

However, while Desiree ultimately returns to 

her birthplace, Stella chooses to “pass over” and 

live her life as a white woman. Stella cuts off all 

ties to her previous life, and takes measures to 

ensure that no one in her new life has any idea 

of her past life as a Black woman. Years later, 

chance brings together the daughters of the 

estranged twin sisters. The result is a breath-

taking generational family story that tackles the 

charged topic of racial passing in America. 

Reading “The Vanishing Half” is like a breath 

of fresh air. Bennett’s writing style immediately 

catches the eye: straightforward and to the 

point, yet incredibly insightful and saturated 

with emotion. The characters are real, raw 

and relatable, and it is so easy to become lost 

in the twins’ respective worlds. Bennett takes 

great care to shape the Vignes sisters into 

three dimensional characters, and as the novel 

unfolds, the characters come to life. While 

Stella is timid and proper, Desiree is restless and 

impulsive. Desiree is flighty like a bird, Stella 

pragmatic and realistic with a mathematician’s 

mind. They are perfect foils to each other, like 

two sides of a coin. Their differences complete 

each other. As Bennett beautifully puts it, the 

Vignes twins were like “two bodies poured 

into one, each pulling it her own way.” Their 

estrangement is devastating for both sisters, and 

each is left feeling like they are missing a part 

of themselves. It’s as if there is a magical bond 

connecting them to each other, and no matter 

where they go, they still feel the presence of their 

far away other half. Bennett carefully explores 

the effects that Stella’s choice to pass over has on 

their sisterly bond and beautifully captures the 

essence of what it means to be a twin. 

The chance meeting of the Vignes twins’ 

daughters strayed dangerously close to being too 

far-fetched, but their unembellished and rocky 

acquaintance ended up being a remarkably 

interesting addition to the novel. Jude (Desiree’s 

daughter) and Kennedy (Stella’s daughter) could 

not have turned out more different; Jude, whose 

skin is “black as tar,” grows up dealing with 

racism, Kennedy, blonde and fair, is raised with 

the privilege of whiteness, Jude is thoughtful 

and studious, Kennedy is dramatic and lazy. It is 

hard to believe these two girls, each the absolute 

antithesis of the other, originate from identical 

twins. This divide 

just uncovers how 

different the lives 

that the Vignes 

twins choose for 

themselves 
are. 

These differences 

translate 
into 

the 
lives 
of 

their daughters, 

shaping 
the 

unfolding 
paths 

of 
the 
next 

generation. Stella and Desiree’s daughters have 

to face the confusion of their split identities, one 

half of the family being white, the other Black. 

Kennedy asks her boyfriend, “Would you love 

me ... if I weren’t white?” Jude faces hatred and 

racial prejudice for being a different skin tone 

than her mother. Stella’s choice to pass over has 

consequences far beyond the scope of her own 

life. Bennett explores the subtle effects of Stella’s 

choice in a carefully measured and deliberate 

manner. 

Found on countless booklists for most 

anticipated new releases in 2020,“The Vanishing 

Half” lives up to the hype. It is clear from the very 

first chapter that author Brit Bennett created 

a masterpiece. Bennett weaves together the 

stories of the Vignes twins and their daughters 

with extraordinary attention to detail, creating 

an emotionally satisfying novel that leaves the 

reader with a subtly new perspective. “The 

Vanishing Half” is a page turner to the very 

end, and transcends genres with elements 

of romance, mystery, history, crime and 

heartbreak. Brit Bennett is a young, up-and-

coming American author, and “The Vanishing 

Half” promises to be her breakthrough novel to 

launch her into the realm of literary recognition. 

This will be one of the best books of the year, no 

doubt about it.

I have a complicated relationship with the 

world of animation. I was raised in the caring 

arms of Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. As a 

kid I would come home from school, crash on the 

couch and watch episodes of “Avatar: The Last 

Airbender,” “Regular Show,” “Adventure Time” 

… the list goes on and on. When I got older, I 

started wading my way into the more mature side 

of animation. I found myself strangely attracted 

to staples of American “adult animation,” i.e. 

“Family Guy,” “The Simpsons,” etc. 

But even as I matured further, it seemed like 

these shows had not. With “The Simpsons” 

now airing its 31st season, my point becomes 

increasingly clear. While real people learn a 

lesson once, Homer 

(Dan Castellenata, 

“Family Guy”) has 

to relearn a new 

job, and how to be a 

good father episode 

after episode. Too 

much of a good 

thing isn’t just a 

bad thing — it’s a 

boring thing. It’s 

an 
unimaginative 

thing. 
American 

media 
moguls 

have a mantra: If 

it ain’t broke, don’t 

fix it. If something 

is making money, 

why end it? Even if it’s exhausted everything it’s 

needed to say and more. What worked in the ’90s 

ought to work in the ’20s, right? 

Needless to say, I became disillusioned and 

disappointed with the art of adult cartoons. I 

became sick of shows that were decent at first, 

but overstayed their welcome. It’s hard to enjoy 

a show when you know the events of the episode 

have little to no impact on the overarching plot of 

the show. It becomes terrifying to imagine that 

these characters, trapped in their tiny worlds, will 

live forever in cycles of eternal recurrence. Their 

desires, actions and choices will be exploited 

for a solid 19 to 25 minutes, then flushed down 

the memory hole. Watching an old episode or 

two of these shows could be fun, but large doses 

of the newer episodes could be lethal. I lost my 

faith in adult animation, that is, until I met a one 

unhinged horse and his anthropomorphic pals.

At first, “BoJack Horseman” didn’t feel all too 

different from other adult cartoon staples. The 

animation style is broadly similar. The world 

and the people who inhabit it are sometimes 

whimsical and vacuous. But where “BoJack 

Horseman” deviates from the norm is its 

obsession with consequence. The brilliance of 

“BoJack” is its depiction of characters dealing 

with the fallout of their actions or desires, 

particularly when these consequences are not 

just contained to one episode, but follow the 

characters for the remainder of the season. This 

makes for substantially more entertaining and 

more meaningful television. 

I am shocked at how well “BoJack Horseman” 

was able to illustrate consequence while 

remaining true to its episodic format. For 

example, in the season one episode, “Our A-Story 

is A ‘D’ Story,” BoJack (Will Arnett, “Arrested 

Development”) steals the “D” from the famous 

Hollywood sign for his crush, Diane (Alison Brie, 

“GLOW”). For the rest of the series, Hollywood is 

referred to as “Hollywoo” to reflect this change. 

That’s a smaller and more charming detail, but it 

sets the tone of realistic repercussions for the rest 

of the show. Other more serious consequences 

still plague BoJack as well as other characters. 

However, when 

something 
is 

not 
resolved, 

these choices are 

purposeful 
in 

supporting 
the 

central 
themes 

of 
 
“BoJack 

Horseman.” 

In 
addition 

to consequence, 

another 
way 

“BoJack 

Horseman” sets 

itself apart from 

its genre is its 

sense of maturity. 

Around 
season 

four, I was worried the show would turn into the 

next “Spongebob Squarepants”: A never-ending 

series of antics with no progress or remaining 

novelty. To my surprise (and relief), the show 

recently ended with season six. Not only was the 

show’s final season emotional and realistic, it felt 

deserved. It felt like the journey we embarked on 

for six whole seasons was coming to a definite 

end. The thread is cut, the curtains close. The 

final episode ends in a simple scene where BoJack 

and Diane look up at the stars, and yet I felt no 

desire to see more. In fact, I wanted to go back 

and rewatch old episodes. I couldn’t imagine 

a moment where I felt like this watching “The 

Simpsons” or “Family Guy.” “BoJack Horseman” 

is a prime example of what adult cartoons should 

strive to be like.

Needless to say, “BoJack Horseman” is the 

exception, not the norm. Luckily for us though, 

it seems like other shows within the genre are 

taking more and more cues from our addled 

horse friend. The latest season of Adult Swim’s 

“Rick and Morty” was surprisingly consequential 

compared to its previous ones. In all, the end 

of “BoJack Horseman” is a new beginning for 

the world of adult cartoons. It’s a world with 

consequence, finality and most of all, meaning.

‘BoJack’ breathes new life

Last Tuesday evening, book critic 

Donna Rifkind spoke to a modest 

audience in the sun-soaked coffee 

shop above Literati bookstore. 

Rifkind’s reviews have appeared 

frequently in the Wall Street 

Journal, The New York Times 

Book Review and Washington 

Post. However, earlier this week 

she presented her own first book, 

entitled, “The Sun and Her Stars: 

Salka Viertel and Hitler’s Exiles 

in the Golden Age of Hollywood.” 

This biography follows the untold 

true story of Salka Viertel (the 

“sun”), the Austrian-born actress 

and screenwriter who opened her 

door in Santa Monica to countless 

European 
actors, 
composers, 

scientists and artists (the “stars”) 

after they were forced out of 

Hitler’s Germany. 

Weaving in facts about the life 

of her “sun,” Rifkind spent the 

evening at Literati describing her 

writing process for the book. She 

grew up in Los Angeles in a self-

described 
bookish 
house 
with 

somewhat 
mysterious 
eastern 

European grandparents. Naming 

the Beach Boys and Disneyland as 

examples, she explained 

how everything at the time 

of her adolescence was new; 

California was thought of 

as a “cultural wasteland” in 

comparison to the artistic 

and relatively diverse East 

Coast. After a decade of 

living on the “superior” 

East 
Coast, 
Rifkind 

returned 
to 
California, 

and it was then that she 

came across Salka Viertel’s 

name.

Viertel 
was 
famous 

for 
being 
one 
of 
the 

best-connected 
women 

in 
Hollywood’s 
Golden 

Age. One of her well-

documented 
friendships 

was with Greta Garbo, who 

was one of the most famous 

actresses of the 1920s and 

’30s. Salka was married to 

Berthold Viertel, a famous 

Viennese 
filmmaker. 

The list goes on and on. When 

researching this interesting yet 

forgotten woman, Rifkind realized 

that Viertel could be found almost 

exclusively in the footnotes of more 

famous actors’ books. She decided 

she would have to write Viertel’s 

biography herself. 

In her discussion of the subject of 

her book, Rifkind made it clear that 

Viertel was an exceptional woman. 

She 
invited 
exiled 
strangers 

into 
an 
international 

community of struggling 

yet 
immensely 
talented 

artists. Viertel herself was 

also a screenwriter and an 

actor, classically trained in 

Europe and fluent in eight 

languages. At the time, 

women had a lot influence, 

but no actual formal power 

in the film industry; Viertel 

used this influence to act 

as a connector between 

the German emigrants and 

Hollywood.

Rifkind also explained 

some of the background 

necessary to understand 

just 
how 
impactful 

Viertel’s actions were at 

the time. While there was 

an abundance of new and 

innovative technology in 

Los Angeles and the film 

industry 
seemed 
to 
be 

progressing by leaps and 

bounds in technique, there was a 

relative shortage of real creativity. 

As the artists who had been 

greatly successful in Germany 

began to arrive in California, they 

needed help, both financially and 

linguistically. Viertel used her 

connections and experience in both 

the film industry and in Europe 

to become a sort of “cultural 

broker.” She opened up her home, 

connected struggling artists with 

filmmakers in need of content, 

acting as a translator and liaison. 

Rifkind said Viertel “softened the 

boundaries between high culture 

and commerce in Hollywood.” She 

went on further to say that a lot of 

the famous stories coming out of 

Hollywood from that time period 

“had their genesis in Salka’s living 

room.”

In her research, she came across 

German 
playwright 
and 
poet, 

Bertolt Brecht, who was one of 

the many exiled artists during the 

Third Reich. With the chaos and 

uncertainty in the world during 

the lives of the people in this book, 

Brecht is perhaps most famous for 

this quote: “In the dark times will 

there also be singing? Yes, there 

will also be singing. About the dark 

times.” This is the clear and simple 

message of Rifkind’s piece.

The most famous review of “The 

Hunt” comes from the 45th president 

of the United States. The man 

formerly known as Donald Drumpf 

tweeted that “The Hunt” was made 

“to inflame and cause chaos. They 

(the filmmakers) create their own 

violence, and then try to blame others. 

They are the true Racists, and are very 

bad for our country!”

The 45th president wasn’t the only 

person to weigh in. Much has been 

said about “The Hunt,” most of which 

came before its release. The buzz 

concerned the plot, which consists of 

“liberal elites” sport hunting radical 

conservatives, dubbed “Deplorables,” 

at a manor in Vermont.

Now, this reviewer is no President 

of the United States, but I do know 

a bit about movies — enough to 

determine that “The Hunt” isn’t 

inflammatory, 
racist 
or 
harmful 

to Americans. Real dangers, like 

shootings and viral infections, easily 

combatable by gun control and test 

kits respectively, probably should be 

higher on this President’s priority list 

than exploitation cinema, but that’s 

neither here nor there. Now, back to 

“The Hunt.”

The movie was originally supposed 

to be released in September 2019, but 

was pulled in the wake of the Dayton 

and El Paso shootings, and moved to 

Mar. 14 of this year (ironically perhaps 

an even worse time to release the 

movie, but who could have known). 

The release date switch was both 

spurred by and accompanied with 

controversy, from both sides of the 

political aisle. Be it because of its 

perceived “glorification of violence,” 

or depiction of deplorable hunting, 

many deemed “The Hunt” “a movie 

that should never have been made.” 

However, 
others 
lamented 
the 

movie’s delay, with one pundit calling 

it “left-wing political correctness… 

getting out of control.” Everyone had 

something to complain about, yet no 

one had even seen the movie. 

Like 
with 
“Joker,” 
so 
much 

had been predicted, analyzed and 

determined about “The Hunt” before 

its release that it was always destined 

to fall short of every hyperbolic claim 

lobbed its way.

First of all, it’s not hate speech. 

“The Hunt” takes aim at everyone, 

reflecting current politics through 

a fun-house mirror that inflates 

the worst qualities of both sides 

of the political aisle. The liberals 

are arrogant, touchy “holier than 

thou” CEOs of huge companies. The 

conservatives are racist, homophobic 

and trophy hunters. While “The 

Hunt” is undoubtedly satirical, it does 

not try to solve America’s problems — 

its politics are too exaggerated to be 

sincere, leaving the viewer to make 

their own conclusions. They’re also 

incredibly funny. One highlight is 

when one of the elites shoots someone 

and leans in, exclaiming, “For the 

record, climate change is real!”

Political flourishes aside, though, 

“The Hunt” is really just a well-done 

thriller. There’s a fascinating swap 

of protagonists at the start, where 

it seems that every character is 

expendable, as well as a few cool fight 

scenes. Betty Gilpin (“Killing Eve”) is 

great too. It’s basically “Black Mirror” 

meets 
“Inglourious 

Basterds,” 
a 
hyper-

violent, 
imaginative 

and satirical thrill ride 

which 
doesn’t 
take 

itself too seriously. Still, 

this feels like somewhat 

of an anticlimax. Was 

all the arguing really 

about something this 

harmless? 

It’s high time movies 

stopped 
becoming 

hotbeds of controversy 

for 
no 
reason. 
All 

the 
hand-wringing 

creates 
unreasonable 

extremes 
that 
the 

movies involved rarely 

live up to. Don’t presidents and TV 

news anchors have better things to 

do than lament the perceived politics 

of an action movie? The conservative 

pundits couldn’t get over the term 

“Deplorable,” even though it is only 

used once or twice in the entire movie. 

Keep in mind, these people are fine 

with hurling “snowflake” at most 

liberal pleas for decency.

Movies aren’t meant to be picked 

apart 
by 
political 
demagogues. 

They’re meant to be watched, and 

hopefully enjoyed, by individuals. It’s 

past time to move past the outrage 

machine — turning cinema into an 

ideological battleground does nothing 

but cloud the movies themselves. If 

people watch a movie before arguing 

about it, everyone will be better off as 

the films can actually stand on their 

own.

That’s not to say that cinema 

shouldn’t engage with contemporary 

issues or be debated for doing so. 

However, if any movie that includes 

politics is going to become a flashpoint 

of societal rage before it is even 

released, studios may eventually start 

avoiding them entirely which, in the 

age of masterpieces like “Get Out” 

and “The Invisible Man,” would be 

something truly deplorable.

‘The Hunt’ is just another thriller, 
despite what the president claims

Maddie Nolan’s long road back

It was just an ordinary play.

Maddie Nolan, playing for her AAU 

team in mid-July after her junior year 

of high school, went up for a layup. But 

the result was anything but ordinary.

On the way up, Maddie made 

contact with a defender, causing her 

to land awkwardly on her left leg. She 

immediately went down in pain, the 

possibility of an ACL tear running 

through her mind.

Maddie’s mother, Kris, viewing 

the play from the stands, saw it a 

little differently. Her first thought 

was an ankle injury, possibly a sprain. 

Something not too serious. But when 

she saw that Maddie couldn’t get up 

on her own, couldn’t put any weight 

on her leg, she knew it was worse. 

Much worse.

The Nolans immediately got in 

their car and drove seven hours from 

Kansas City to Zionsville, Indiana — 

their hometown —fearing the worst. 

Maddie’s uncle, a doctor, helped her 

get an MRI immediately when they 

got back.

The initial diagnosis was a torn 

popliteus tendon, which would keep 

Maddie out six to eight weeks. It 

was definitely a setback, but she was 

relieved. She would still be able to play 

her senior season of high school.

But because it was such an 

uncommon injury, doctors continued 

to re-evaluate it. And when they did, 

they found that Maddie was missing 

a chunk of cartilage in her knee — a 

microfracture — which could keep 

her out anywhere between six and 18 

months, depending on the procedure.

“I cried,” Maddie said. “You miss 

your senior season. You miss playing 

with all the kids you’ve grown up 

with. It was really tough.”

Added 
Kris: 
“(It 
was) 
like 

somebody had sucker punched me 

right in the stomach. … Just knowing 

that she wouldn’t be able to play her 

senior year, because she loved her 

high school teammates so much, was 

probably even more heartbreaking.”

***

From a young age, Kris and Henry 

— Maddie’s father — knew that 

Maddie was driven.

When she was five, she played on 

a co-ed youth soccer team. She was 

never afraid to take down the boys 

and do whatever it took to score.

“She was a pretty intense little kid,” 

Kris said.

But she was always destined to 

play basketball. Both her parents 

coached high school basketball and 

Kris played at New Mexico State, 

where she graduated as the all-time 

leading scorer. Dinners were filled 

with conversations about plays and 

days were filled either in the gym or 

watching basketball on TV.

Kris knew that Maddie could be 

something special since sixth grade, 

but it wasn’t until eighth grade 

Maddie started to put the work in.

Zionsville 
hadn’t 
been 
a 

powerhouse in girls basketball for 

a long time — it was long since Kris 

played there and set the all-time 

scoring record. When Maddie was in 

eighth grade, the team won just four 

games. But Maddie wanted to change 

that.

“Maddie’s class came in and they 

were told, ‘Oh, you guys will never 

amount to anything. Nobody wants to 

come to girls games,’ ” Kris said. “And 

Maddie and her teammates, her class, 

are just like ‘OK, watch us.’ ”

Maddie knew freshman year would 

be a challenge. For the first time in her 

life, she was playing against players 

four years older than her, who were 

bigger and stronger. But Maddie saw 

the potential the team had and knew 

her class could change the reputation 

of Zionsville girls basketball. She 

spent hours in the gym after practices 

putting up shots. On Sundays, she 

took Henry’s key to the school and 

shot for hours on end. 

Maddie earned a starting spot her 

freshman year and led Zionsville to 

its first section title in 20 years. Her 

sophomore year, Zionsville won the 

section again.

By the time her junior year came 

around, the college offers started 

coming in. Maddie had interest from 

many power conference schools, 

including Michigan. Her dream of 

playing at one looked like it would 

become a reality.

All the while, Maddie was playing 

the best basketball of her life. She 

averaged 21.5 points per game and 

broke 
Kris’s 
Zionsville 
all-time 

scoring record as it made a run to the 

state championship game. Maddie 

was named to the Indiana all-state 

team. Her basketball career looked as 

promising as ever.

But then came that dreaded July 

day.

***

When Maddie heard the six to 18 

month timetable, her first thought 

was, “Six months and I’m playing 

again.” 

She counted out the days. Six 

months would allow her to return for 

her final regular season high school 

game. There was no doubt in her mind 

she would be back for that game. But 

those six months were difficult.

The 
phone 
stopped 
ringing. 

Schools stopped showing interest. 

Maddie didn’t have many options 

left, and committed to Miami (OH). 

She wouldn’t get to play at a power 

conference school.

“She wanted to be on the big stage,” 

Kris said. “That was her goal, and 

when she got hurt, there were just a 

handful of schools that stuck with her. 

So seeing that dream, at that time, was 

not going to be realized was hard. 

“We just kept saying, ‘Look, you 

still get to play basketball. There are 

a lot of kids who don’t and who won’t 

be able to come back from something 

like this or get a worse diagnosis than 

you had.’ ”

Maddie started physical therapy 

a month after her surgery, but she 

couldn’t do much — she would still be 

on crutches for another month. In her 

first few sessions, she was extremely 

limited. 

“For the first couple times I would 

literally sit on a table, do heel slides, 

trying to see how far I could bring up 

my leg, just kind of flexing my quad, 

getting those muscles back,” Maddie 

said “So it was very limited.”

All she wanted to do was get back 

to playing basketball, but for the first 

few months of her rehab she had to 

essentially re-learn how to use her 

leg. But once she was allowed to put 

weight on it and stop using crutches 

— about two-and-a-half months after 

her surgery — the road back became 

a little bit clearer. Maddie started 

seeing a sport-specific trainer to begin 

basketball activities, in addition to her 

physical therapist.

Once she got back to basketball, 

as limited as it was, Maddie was 

more motivated than ever to make it 

back in six months. When her high 

school season started, and for the first 

time ever she had to watch from the 

bench, it grew even more. There was 

no doubt in her mind she would play 

another high school game.

And 
when 
that 
doctor’s 

appointment finally came, exactly 

six months after her surgery, Maddie 

finally heard the words she had waited 

so long to hear. She was cleared to play 

basketball again.

A couple days later, midway 

through 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 

Zionsville’s 
final 
regular 
season 

game, Maddie checked in. She didn’t 

play much. She limped a lot. She was 

nowhere near the dominant player 

she had been her junior year. But 

Maddie was just happy to be back.

“The smile on her face when she 

went into the game midway through 

the first quarter, that smile could light 

up a dark room,” Kris said.

Adrenaline got Maddie through 

that first game. But for Kris, it was 

the most stressed she had ever been 

watching from the sidelines.

“I could hardly watch that game,” 

Kris said. “Every time she fell down, 

or drove to the basket, I’m covering 

my eyes. It was nerve racking.”

Maddie played in four more games 

her senior year, feeling pain and 

limping in every one. Getting to finish 

out her high school career on the court 

was worth it, and Maddie was excited 

to get the chance to truly return to full 

strength at Miami (OH).

But in April, a coaching change at 

Miami allowed Maddie to re-open 

her recruitment. And when she did, 

her dream of playing at a power 

conference school came back as 

Michigan re-entered the fold. While 

Maddie wanted to commit, she was 

concerned that when she got to 

campus her knee wouldn’t be fully 

healed and she wouldn’t be able to 

play at that level.

“She was still rehabbing and still 

working on strength,” Kris said. “And 

(Michigan coach) Kim (Barnes Arico) 

just believed in her. Kim had seen her, 

knew what she was capable of doing.”

Maddie committed to Michigan in 

May.

Before she got to Ann Arbor, 

Maddie was selected to play on the 

Indiana All-Star team in June — her 

first game action in three months. 

In that time, her knee hadn’t gotten 

much better. She still felt pain. She 

still limped.

“Obviously I was playing,” Nolan 

said. “But I didn’t feel like it was the 

same.”

So 
when 
Maddie 
arrived 
in 

Ann Arbor weeks later, there were 

concerns as to whether she would 

ever be able to contribute at the 

college level. She couldn’t practice 

fully from the start. She didn’t do all 

of the workouts and running, and 

sometimes she didn’t practice at all if 

her knee was hurting too much.

To alleviate the pain and stabilize 

her knee when she played, the training 

staff gave Maddie a bulky knee brace, 

which added about an inch on the side 

of her leg. She had to learn how to run 

with the brace on and how to dribble 

without dribbling off the brace.

Despite all the obstacles, Maddie 

got to work. When she didn’t practice, 

she biked or ran on an Ultra-G 

treadmill. After practice, she worked 

to strengthen her leg. Her thigh grew 

so much over the summer that she had 

to get a new knee brace.

“I got a lot more muscular, which 

I think helped with the pounding 

not as much,” Maddie said. “It’s more 

muscle around my leg so it doesn’t 

hurt as much when I step.”

Even though Maddie saw major 

improvement over the summer, by 

the time the season started she was 

still behind the rest of the team. Early 

in the season, she played sparingly, 

typically only in blowouts.

But as the season progressed, 

Maddie showed more and more in 

practice, and she impressed. By the 

time senior forward Kayla Robbins 

suffered a season-ending torn ACL on 

Jan. 19, Maddie had earned enough 

trust from the coaching staff to take 

some of her minutes.

“She was kind of behind everyone 

just because she wasn’t out there, and 

we didn’t really have an opportunity 

to see her game and see what she was 

capable of doing,” Barnes Arico said. 

“But it was funny because then when 

she started to get out there, little by 

little I’m like, ‘Golly, Maddie’s doing a 

good job. Golly, Maddie’s doing a good 

job.’ And it was quiet. It was a quiet 

way about her that she continued to 

impress.

“She just always seems to be in 

the right place. She doesn’t get sped 

up. For a young kid, for a freshman, 

her understanding of the game is 

incredible. She handles pressure 

well.”

And when starting sophomore 

guard Danielle Rauch broke her hand 

in practice the day before a Feb. 6 

game against Purdue, it was Maddie 

who Barnes Arico called upon to fill 

her spot.

But when Maddie told her parents 

earlier that day she might be starting, 

they didn’t really believe it. They were 

headed to the airport, about to get on 

a plane to El Paso for Kris’s college 

reunion. 

And when they got off the plane an 

hour before the game started and saw 

that it was true, that Maddie really 

was starting, everything else they had 

planned had to wait.

“I’ve got my phone pulled up, we’ve 

got it ready to go,” Kris said. “So we’re 

watching the game on the drive to Las 

Cruces, New Mexico, and then we 

check into the hotel and I’m like, ‘We 

can’t eat or anything until we watch 

this.’ ”

Maddie played 29 minutes that 

game and scored two points. For 

her first few starts, that was the 

norm — she wasn’t an offensive focal 

point. But over time, Maddie gained 

confidence, and made more and more 

of an impact. 

Like in a Feb. 27 win against Penn 

State, when she hit two consecutive 

3-pointers to put the game out 

of reach. Or against Nebraska in 

the second round of the Big Ten 

Tournament, when she scored five 

points in two minutes to break a tie 

and give Michigan a lead it wouldn’t 

relinquish. Or the next day against 

No. 11 Northwestern, when her 10 

second-half points led the Wolverines 

to their biggest victory of the season.

“She’s become an offensive threat,” 

junior forward Hailey Brown said 

after the Northwestern game. “You 

have to guard her. She can take it 

off the bounce, she kind of does 

everything. … She’s a large defensive 

presence as well. She’s definitely a 

strength in our team and opponents 

have to guard her.”

Maddie may never regain the same 

speed or explosiveness that she had 

before. She still has to wear the bulky 

brace. She has to go through intensive 

preparation before each game just to 

be able to play, including cutting off 

80 percent of the blood flow to her leg 

and doing leg presses to strengthen it.

But to Maddie, it’s all worth it. 

She may never be the most talented 

player on the team. She may never get 

back to her pre-injury form. But it’s 

becoming harder and harder to see a 

future for Michigan in which she isn’t 

a key asset.

And if you told her that less than 

two years ago, she would feel lucky.

“When she takes time to reflect 

on what her journey has been, I 

think she’s just very thankful for the 

opportunities that she’s been given,” 

Kris said. “... It just amazes me what 

she’s done. When Dr. Miller told her 

an ACL tear would have been better 

— you hear that and you’re like, ‘What 

did you just say?’ — than to have this 

injury. 

“It’s a chip on her shoulder. That’s 

how she rolls.”

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico expected her team to get an NCAA Tournament bid this year.

MILES MACKLIN/Daily

The Michigan baseball team showed promise in the 15 games it played before the season’s cancellation.

Adjacent Stadium Boulevard, outside of 

Crisler Center, there’s a billboard.

During the day it’s merely a roadside 

distraction. Its rotating images about 

Michigan are only given attention when 

drivers sit still, stuck at the red light 

between Stadium and Main.

At night, its hundreds of LED panels 

stand alone as a source of light for the 

meager commuters driving past to look to, 

one of the only roadside attractions they’ll 

pass.

Most of the frames it shows are harmless: 

a plea for a passerby to buy football tickets, 

a lab photo with a declaration of being the 

best public school in the nation. There’s 

nothing someone looking at it would think 

twice about, until it reaches the photo of 

Jon Teske and Naz Hillmon framing the 

words “This week in Michigan basketball.”

This week in Michigan basketball is 

depressing. COVID-19 has forced the 

NCAA and Michigan to stop all athletic 

events for the rest of the year. There’s not 

much else to it, other than depressing. 

Seniors won’t see their season off the way 

they want to. Neither will coaches or fans 

or other players.

It brings a finality to the season that 

no one wanted, forcing us to reflect on an 

almost-done women’s basketball team far 

before anyone ever wanted.

Who knew that when a reporter asked 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico about 

reflecting on the season, “Now that it was 

over,” after its semifinal loss to Ohio State 

in the Big Ten Tournament, the season 

actually was over? And Barnes Arico’s 

gentle nudge at the end of her answer that 

the season was not over — there was the 

NCAA Tournament after all — proved to 

be wrong.

“This was a special group,” Barnes Arico 

said last Saturday. “It’s a special year. It’s 

kind of a bummer to end on a loss, but I 

think we put ourselves in a position with 

this tournament and with our schedule all 

season long to be an NCAA Tournament 

team.”

This 
year 
in 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball was a rollercoaster, and it’s 

easy to look at the bad parts. The loss of 

superfan Chuck Raab on the day of the 

season opener, a fourth-quarter collapse 

against a weak Notre Dame team, Kayla 

Robbins’s ACL tear, blowout losses at 

home to Maryland and Indiana — a myriad 

of times to look back on and ponder, “If 

only.”

This season was long and grueling, 

with few payoffs for the Wolverines. An 

overtime victory over a Syracuse team on 

the program’s first-ever appearance on 

ESPN, sweeping Michigan State for the 

first time in years, a 15-point win over 

then-No. 18 Iowa on Pink Day — yet the 

biggest payoffs have, perhaps, a lot more 

to do with the future than with this year.

Freshman guard Maddie Nolan, after 

riding the bench for the first three months 

of the season, became a starter due to 

Danielle Rauch’s injury and literally stole 

the show in Indianapolis. Freshman center 

Izabel Varejão developed throughout the 

season to where, at the end, her potential 

was obvious: With Naz Hillmon, she will 

be unstoppable.

And then there are the two that you 

forget are sophomores, Hillmon and point 

guard Amy Dilk. Hillmon last week, amid 

the bombardment of depressing sporting 

news, was named one of five finalists for 

the best power forwards in the country. 

Her dominance became commonplace, to 

the point where no one blinked when she 

had a double-double by the third quarter.

Dilk, 
meanwhile, 
struggled 
with 

turnovers to start the year, but as the 

season progressed, the ball grew closer 

and closer to her hip until the pair were 

inseparable. She also became a scorer and 

distributor and figured out how to balance 

those two things.

While those futures are known, senior 

guard Akienreh Johnson’s is not. The 

team has applied for her to gain another 

year of eligibility, retroactively, after her 

freshman year was cut short with an ACL 

injury.

And now, with practices cancelled and a 

dead campus, she has to wait, not knowing 

if she’ll get that extra year — or when.

She’ll have to wait while that billboard 

outside Crisler Center will keep changing, 

rotating through its eight pictures as fewer 

and fewer people drive past it, blinking 

along as the country shuts down.

That 
billboard 
will 
be 
normal, 

promising normal, promising a next year 

for Michigan. One that will be more stable, 

with an ending.

For Wolverines, a long wild 

year holds promise for 2021

KENT SCHWARTZ

Daily Sports Writer

Last Wednesday night, I sat in front 

of a microphone and predicted that the 

Michigan baseball team would end its 

season at the College 

World Series.

Less than 24 hours 

later, 
the 
take 
was 

rendered freezing cold; 

the NCAA and Big Ten 

canceled all competition 

for the remainder of the 

spring sports season in 

response to the COVID-

19 pandemic. Now, not 

even 
the 
best 
team 

would be Omaha bound, let alone the 8-7 

Wolverines.

“(We haven’t) played a cupcake schedule 

like a lot of teams have done,” Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich said. “... We’ve played 

all (NCAA) Regional-caliber teams.” 

True. Pepperdine, the Wolverines’ final 

foe of the campaign and to whom they lost 

two of three, slashed a gaudy .301/.390/.441 

as a team. Connecticut starting pitcher 

Nick Krauth tossed 10 2/3 innings against 

the Wolverines, earning two wins and 

allowing just one earned run.

But other high-performing teams and 

players didn’t stop the Wolverines from 

taking three of four in their opening 

weekend of play in Arizona, winning an 

away series against Cal Poly or avoiding 

sweeps against the Huskies and Waves. At 

the end of the day, the greatest roadblock 

to Michigan’s success was Michigan itself. 

Offensively, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

great at piggybacking off the success of 

teammates, but often unable to get the ball 

rolling. 

“I think the problem is that we didn’t 

use (my leadoff homer) to gain momentum, 

and we struggled the rest of the game to 

string quality at bats together,” Nwogu 

said after losing the last of three games 

to the Huskies, 9-2. “I think sporadically 

we put together some good at-bats but 

not enough to plate runs and that was the 

problem.” 

That was painfully evident in power 

outage defeats, and sometimes held true 

even in victory. In a 5-0 win at California, 

Michigan was stymied from posting 

crooked numbers despite working against 

the Golden Bears’ bullpen for eight 

innings. 

But 
when 
the 
floodgates 
opened, 

they gaped, and that was a cause for 

optimism. Against Cal Poly in Arizona, the 

Wolverines used two three-run innings 

— sending the entire order to bat in the 

first — to put up an eight-spot that lasted 

despite a catastrophe in the bullpen. 

A near-constant shuffle of the lineup 

and relievers didn’t help maintain this 

success.

“We haven’t had the same lineup twice 

which always leads to inconsistencies,” 

Bakich 
said 
after 
last 
weekend’s 

Pepperdine series. “But in the early part 

of the year you just have to experiment to 

find your best nine and we still don’t know. 

We are still trying to figure that out.”

Bakich had just begun to figure that out. 

A step in the right direction was moving 

junior shortstop Jack Blomgren from 

second to third in the order; Blomgren 

responded by reaching base 16 times in the 

ensuing eight-game span.

“I think it was just to split up the right 

handers,” Bakich said. “We want Jack up 

in the first inning, but I don’t think there 

was any strategy behind it other than 

sandwiching a left-hander between him 

and Nwogu.” 

By playing 31 of his 36 guys in the 

season’s first and only month, rather than 

sticking with nearly exclusively veterans, 

Bakich had a lot of similar decisions to 

make. And at season’s end, a core group of 

starters was starting to emerge.

Freshman outfielder Clark Elliott was 

becoming a fixture in right field, freshman 

Ted Burton and sophomore Cam Hart 

formed a yin and yang at third base and 

freshman Jimmy Obertop began to take 

over the first-base job. Redshirt freshman 

left-hander Steven Hajjar and junior right-

hander Blake Beers were the rotation’s 

rookies, but each pitched to lower ERAs 

than ace junior right-hander Jeff Criswell.

With junior outfielder Jesse Franklin 

and projected closer, sophomore right-

hander Willie Weiss, winding down 

rehab on their injuries — along with a 

more solidified group of starters — the 

Wolverines could have reached a perfect 

storm 
against 
significantly 
weaker 

competition. 

The bright spot is that everyone on the 

roster who would like to return will be 

able to do so for the 2021 season, thanks 

to eligibility relief for spring athletes. 

With all the pieces able to return, Bakich 

can continue to assemble the puzzle of 

the starters on which he was nearing 

completion this year. 

“The number one goal every year is to 

add as much value as we possibly can to 

an already storied program,” Bakich said 

at the team media day. “So last year going 

into it we wanted page 153 in the Michigan 

history book to be bookmarked for all 

time, and it’s the same goal this year.”

That goal, of course, is no longer 

attainable.

The value from team 154, though, may 

not come with a trophy, but with a group 

that showed the capability to power 

Michigan to Omaha come summer 2021.

In 15 games, ‘M’ showed what 

next year could hold

Bonaire is a small island off the coast of 

Venezuela that is a part of the Netherlands 

and home to dozens of ethnic backgrounds. 

It holds a special place in my heart, as I have 

been there every single year since I was 9 

months old. This spring break trip was my 

19th time on the island. Every time that I 

return, the ocean and the people capture my 

heart all over again.

Most people visit Bonaire for scuba 

diving or windsurfing. The windy west side 

of the island provides perfect waves for 

windsurfers, while the sheltered east side 

is where all of the dive sites are located. 

There are 86 dive sites on Bonaire, all on the 

eastern side of the island.

My parents first visited Bonaire for 

scuba diving in the 90s. I learned to dive 

in Bonaire as soon as I was old enough,and 

have been certified for 9 years. I have been 

on approximately 150 dives in Bonaire over 

the years. Before I even learned how to 

snorkel, I would lay on a raft with a small 

plastic viewing hole and watch my parents 

scuba dive below me as my grandparents 

were with me on the surface. Bonaire is 

where I first discovered my love for wildlife, 

and photography. I was mesmerized with 

the whole other world that was beneath the 

surface of the ocean, and I still get that same 

feeling jumping into the water this trip. 

After watching my dad take underwater 

photos for years, I wanted nothing more 

than to try it. I got my first camera, 

waterproof up to 20 feet, when I was 7. 

I was truly enamored with underwater 

photography back then, and I still am today. 

It’s interesting to think how I actually 

learned how to photograph underwater, not 

on land. Underwater photography presents 

a lot more challenges than taking photos on 

land and requires a different skill set. 

In the coral reefs there is an abundance 

of marine life. There is a large variety of 

fish species as well as other interesting 

creatures. In the shallows there are often 

rays and sea turtles passing by. Every dive 

has something interesting to see.

Bonaire’s 
main 
industry 
is 
tourism, 

however they also produce and export sea 

salt. It is strange to be driving along the 

coast, and suddenly see white mountains of 

salt, that almost look like snow.

Bonaire is also a leading destination for 

sustainable tourism. All divers must pay a 

marine park fee to help fund reef restoration. 

There 
are 
many 
restoration 
projects 

happening all over the island. Visiting divers 

can even take a coral restoration course and 

help with the maintenance of some of the 

projects. The coral reefs are diminishing 

due to many stressors including rising ocean 

temperatures, and increasingly common 

severe storms. Common restoration projects 

are coral nurseries and tying up sponges with 

fishing line until they re-establish.

On land, Bonaire is very well known for 

their flamingos. The island is one of few 

breeding locations in the Caribbean, and the 

birds are protected on the island. Flamingos 

have become a mascot for Bonaire, tributes to 

them found all over the island. Flamingos are 

born with grey feathers that turn pink due to 

the shrimp and algae in their diet.

Bonaire holds such a special place in my 

heart, it is where I first discovered my love for 

nature and photography, which are two very 

big parts of my life.
