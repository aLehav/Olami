In a phone interview with Uni-

versity spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald on Tuesday afternoon, the 
Daily requested specific informa-
tion about the sexual misconduct 
investigation process in order to 
clarify several aspects of a news 
report published in today’s edi-
tion of the paper. On behalf of the 
University, Fitzgerald declined 
to comment and said the Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy would 
suffice in answering the Daily’s 
questions.

In February 2014, the Depart-

ment of Education’s Office of 
Civil Rights announced it would 
investigate the University for 
violations of Title IX legislation. 
In response to the investigation, 
the University issued the follow-
ing statement: “We’re very proud 
of our student sexual misconduct 
policy, our prevention efforts and 
our programs to support sur-
vivors of sexual misconduct … 
we believe that a review of our 
policy, programs and investiga-
tions will conclude that the Uni-
versity of Michigan is doing what 
it should in this important area.”

While the University claims it 

is doing “what it should” to sup-
port survivors of sexual miscon-
duct, after reviewing documents 
and University policies, it is 
undeniable that the University’s 
sexual assault adjudication and 
education processes contain sig-
nificant policy faults that cannot 
be ignored.

First, the University’s sexual 

misconduct investigations func-
tion in a manner that brings 
their equitability into question. 
Second, there are discrepancies 
between the Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Awareness Center’s 
definition of consent and that of 
University policy it determines 
cases on, which raises concerns 
about the educational materials 
promoted by the University. In 
light of this specific case and the 
larger Title IX investigation, the 
University is left with one choice: 
It must change its sexual miscon-
duct investigation policies and 
formulate better sexual educa-
tion programs for its students. To 
persist with the current policies 
would only further discredit the 
University’s sincerity in combat-
ing sexual assault on campus.

In December 2013, LSA soph-

omore Emily Campbell alleged 
that she was involved in unwant-
ed sexual contact with then-
LSA-freshmen Aaron Reuben 
and Jonathan Barnet. Campbell 
reported the incident to SAPAC, 
which referred her to a Uni-
versity hospital sexual assault 
nurse examiner, or SANE. A 
University Police Department 
investigation was automatically 
initiated. Information from this 
investigation was brought to the 
Office of Institutional Equity, 
where an adjudication process

ocuments reviewed by The Michigan Daily — detailing a 2013 sexual assault complaint filed 
by a University student — raise potential questions about the school’s internal process for 
investigating allegations of sexual misconduct.

Documents reviewed by The Michigan 

Daily, 
detailing 
a 
2013 
sexual 
assault 

complaint filed by a University student, raise 
questions about the University’s process for 
investigating allegations of sexual misconduct.

In February 2014, the U.S. Department of 

Education launched a formal investigation 
into the University’s handling of sexual 
misconduct cases. In the months 
since 
federal 
officials 
commenced 

their 
investigation, 
the 
University 

was subject to another Title IX 
complaint. Title IX is a component of 
federal education law that prevents 
discrimination based on gender in 
any education programs that receive federal 
funding.

In December 2013, then-LSA-freshman 

Emily Campbell reported to the University 
that she had been sexually assaulted on 
campus by Jonathan Barnet and Aaron 
Reuben, who were LSA freshmen at the time. 

The 
University’s 
judicial 
process 

determined the two were not responsible for 
sexual misconduct — a decision Campbell 
unsuccessfully 
appealed 
— 
but 
were 

sanctioned for disseminating photos of the 
incident without Campbell’s knowledge or 
consent. Barnet and Reuben were ultimately 
suspended, effective in January 2015, on 
that charge — a decision they unsuccessfully 
appealed. They will remain suspended until 
January 2016.

Campbell’s 
mother, 
Maria 
Mortellaro, 

filed a Title IX complaint with the U.S. 
Department of Education on Campbell’s 
behalf. The complaint argues the University 
mishandled her daughter’s sexual misconduct 
case. The Department of Education has taken 
on the complaint and added it to its ongoing 
investigation of the University.

This complaint details several steps of the 

University’s process that Mortellaro says were 
handled unfairly and alleges the University 
failed to provide a prompt and equitable 
response to Campbell’s report.

The complaint centers around Campbell 

and Mortellaro’s view that a discrepancy 
persists between the standards of consent 

taught by the University’s Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center and those 
used during the University’s judicial process. 
The complaint also alleges that the University 
does not employ adequate protocols for 
determining what types of evidence and 
witnesses are permitted in proceedings. 

Another key part of the complaint is 

Campbell’s claim that the University advised 
her that hiring a lawyer was unnecessary. 
However, without a lawyer advising her 
throughout the University’s appeals process, 
Campbell said attorneys for the respondents 

blocked several documents from being 
considered in the appeals deliberations. 
These documents included a letter from the 
University Police detective who investigated 
her case, in which he called the panel’s decision 
to find the respondents not responsible for 
sexual assault “unfathomable.”

The 
Daily 
reviewed 
the 
documents 

pertaining to the University’s investigation, 
including the Office of Institutional Equity’s 
investigation 
report, 
appeals 
documents 

filed by both Campbell and the students who 
she alleges assaulted her — referred to as 
“respondents” in the University’s documents — 
and the final findings of an appeals board. 

Attorneys for the respondents chose to 

speak on behalf of their clients and did not 
comply with the Daily’s requests to interview 
the respondents directly on Tuesday. 

The Daily filed a Freedom of Information 

Act request in January 2015 regarding 
documents considered in the U.S. Department 
of Education’s March 2014 investigation of the 
University. The Daily has not received these 
requested documents. 

University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 

could not provide more information regarding 
any questions raised by the documents 
related to this case and declined to comment 
regarding the University’s general processes 
at large. It could not be confirmed whether the 
documents reviewed by the Daily for this case 
encompassed all of those generated by the 
investigation and judicial proceedings.

The incident occurred after Campbell, 

according to OIE investigation documents, 
attended a date party as a Kappa Kappa Gamma 
sorority pledge. Both Reuben and Barnet 
attended the same party. Campbell alleges she 
was coerced into participating in unwanted 
sexual acts with both Reuben, a Pi Kappa Alpha 
fraternity pledge, and his roommate Barnet, 
a Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity pledge, at 
approximately 2 a.m. on Dec. 6, 2013 in their 

Mary Markley Residence Hall dorm 
room. 

Campbell reported the alleged 

assault to SAPAC later in the day on 
Dec. 6, where she was advised to go the 
University Hospital. At the hospital, a 
sexual assault nurse examiner, also 
known as a SANE, administered a rape 

kit. 

At the hospital, University Police Detective 

Ryan Cavanaugh was the first to ask her 
questions about the previous night’s events — 
the initial step in a yearlong series of hearings, 
interviews and discussions regarding the 
incident.

After Cavanaugh’s interview with Campbell, 

the Office of Student Conflict Resolution and 
Anthony Walesby, the University’s Title IX 
coordinator, reviewed the case and transferred 
it to the Office of Institutional Equity, which 
launched

Roughly 200 sign 
letter calling for 
cancellation of 

‘American Sniper’

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Center for Campus Involve-

ment announced Tuesday afternoon 
they would cancel a planned show-
ing of “American Sniper” at UMix 
following a student petition over the 
depiction of certain communities in 
the film.

In a statement posted on by Face-

book CCI, which runs UMix, the 
organization said the choice was 
made in response to concerns raised 
by students about the film in the peti-
tion.

“Student reactions have clearly 

articulated that this is neither the 
venue nor the time to show this 
movie,” the statement read. “We 
deeply regret causing harm to mem-
bers of our community, and appreci-
ate the thoughtful feedback provided 
to us by students.”

LSA sophomore Lamees Mek-

kaoui started the petition Tuesday 
morning after discovering that 
UMix, a University program dedi-
cated to providing students with 
alcohol-free events on Friday nights, 
would be showing the 2014 war 
drama “American Sniper” this Fri-
day.

Mekkaoui, who is a a member 

of Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality and the Middle Eastern and 

Arab Network on campus, said she 
found the choice of film disconcert-
ing because of its depictions of the 
Iraq War and residents of the Middle 
Eastern and North African region.

The film, directed by Clint East-

wood and starring Bradley Cooper, 
is based on the autobiography of 
Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy Seal who 
served in Iraq and has the most con-
firmed kills as a sniper in U.S. mili-
tary history.

“As a student who identifies as an 

Arab and Middle Eastern student, I 
feel that ‘American Sniper’ condones 
a lot of anti-Middle Eastern and 
North African propaganda,” Mek-
kaoui said.

She added that she felt the film 

was released at a time when negative 
attitudes toward Middle Eastern and 
Northern African groups were at a 
peak.

“It was released at a time when 

these anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and 
anti-Middle Eastern (and) North 
African hate crimes were already 
skyrocketing and this movie only 
contributed to that,” he said.

In response to the CCI’s announce-

ment on Facebook Tuesday morning 
that it would screen the film during 
UMix, Mekkaoui sent CCI a personal 
letter of concern at 11 a.m.

After posting the letter on her 

Facebook page and receiving positive 
feedback, Mekkaoui then drafted a 
second letter expressing similar con-
cerns to her personal letter that was 
circulated to various communities on 
campus.

Weinzweig to 
jointly deliver 
commencement 

address

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Ari Weinzweig, Zingerman’s 

co-owner and founding partner, 
could be found on campus Tues-
day before his commencement 
speech next month for students 
who knew where to look.

During a “Man Behind the 

Sandwich” event Tuesday in the 
Michigan 
Union, 
Weinzweig 

spent an hour answering student 
questions from students about 
the operation of Zingerman’s 
and his business philosophy. The 
event was hosted by Alpha Kappa 
Psi, a business fraternity on cam-
pus, and sponsored by the Cen-

tral Student Government and the 
Ross School of Business.

Weinzweig and his partner 

Paul Saginaw opened Zinger-
man’s Deli on March 15, 1982. 
After 
33 
years 
Zingerman’s 

operations are still expanding, 
though it continues to operates 
solely out of Ann Arbor. Weinz-
weig said even though the deli 
originally faced difficulties, hard 
work eventually validated their 
business model.

“Five to six years after open-

ing, we were geniuses,” Weinz-
weig said.

He drew many of his remarks 

from the Twelve Natural Laws of 
Business, a series of ideas about 
business created by both Zinger-
man’s founders. The laws include 
philosophies such as valuing 
staff, making the workplace 
engaging, and always looking for 
ways to improve.

Weinzweig told students he 

considers the set of laws to be 

universal principles that all suc-
cessful businesses adhere to, 
consciously or unconsciously.

At Zingerman’s, he said these 

principles were integrated in sev-
eral ways, leading to a structure 
that’s different from traditional 
businesses.

“Our business is like an old 

school family farm,” Weinzweig 
said. “It looks messy from a cor-
porate standpoint, but within 
itself it is organized, like the fam-
ily farm (it) has a harmony and a 
rhythm to it.”

He also referred to these prin-

ciples to dispel what he called 
common misconceptions about 
business. Weinzweig said people 
often consider success to be the 
end of logistical and financial 
challenges, such as not having 
enough money to operate. How-
ever, he said he believes success 
can be defined as simply having 
more influence over the types of 
challenges a business has.

“Success means you get better 

problems,” he said. “It’s getting 
the problems you want.”

According to Weinzweig, a 

“better problem” is Zingerman’s 
policy of using higher quality 
products that are more expen-
sive, meaning they have to spend 
more money to uphold quality. 
Another is finding the time to 
launch the many new ideas he 
has to improve the company, 
given how much he’s investing 
in Zingerman’s due to its relative 
success.

Weinzweig also highlighted 

the importance of employees, 
describing Zingerman’s process 
for engaging employees in the 
company and fostering a sense of 
individual purpose.

“I realized we were teaching 

our employees about business in 
a systemic way,” he said.

Legislation in 
response to last 
week’s divestment 
proposal is tabled

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

Central Student Government 

tabled a proposal Tuesday evening 
requesting an audit of the Univer-
sity endowment for companies 
directly and uniquely responsible 
for ethical violations throughout 
the world during the final meeting 
of its 2014-2015 student assembly.

After a first motion to table the 

resolution failed, the legislative 
body voted on a second motion with 
14 in favor of tabling the proposal, 13 
opposed and one abstaining.

If passed, the resolution would 

have led CSG to ask the University 
Office of Investments to conduct 
periodic audits on companies the 

University 
Endowment 
Fund 

invests in to assess whether or not 
these companies are deliberately, 
directly and uniquely responsible 
for ethical violations nationally as 
well as internationally.

Engineering senior Andy Mod-

ell, an Engineering representative 
for CSG, and Education senior 
Michael Chrzan, a School of Edu-
cation representative, wrote the 
legislation. Modell said it was 
written in response to the divest-
ment resolution, which CSG voted 
against during the assembly’s 
meeting last week.

Modell said he was inspired 

by the hundreds of members of 
the University community who 
attended last week’s meeting, 
which he said showed him how 
concerned many on campus are 
about the University’s invest-
ments.

He said he thought his resolu-

tion addressed many of the con-
cerns raised during last week’s 
meeting.

“Hopefully this way the Uni-

versity will be more responsible 
in regards to the ethics of their 
investments and students will be 
overall happy,” he said.

Chrzan echoed Modell’s sen-

timents, adding that the resolu-
tion is meant to be a measure that 
keeps the University administra-
tion transparent.

“I think it’s a really good first 

step towards what students want-
ed last week,” Chrzan said. “I 
think it’s a great first step for the 
University holding itself account-
able and not putting it on the stu-
dents to do it.”

The rules were suspended to 

allow the resolution to be moved 
to second reading, after which the 
resolution can be voted on. This nor-
mally occurs in the week following 
the introduction of a proposal.

Michael Yee, a School of 

Medicine 
representative, 
first 

motioned to have the resolution 
tabled because he felt the resolu-
tion needed to be given more time 
and thought. That motion was 
debated and then failed to pass.

Following the initial motion to 

table, several amendments were 
made to the resolution. These 
included calling for an audit to be 
conducted every three years by 
the Investment Office as well as 
for a CSG representative to meet 
with an official from the Invest-
ment Office to learn about the 
audit and its implications.

As amendments were being 

made to the resolution, Business 
junior Maddy Walsh motioned to 
table the resolution. The second 
motion was voted on and led to its 
ultimate tabling.

While those who voted for the 

tabling of the proposal said they 
felt similar to Yee, others such as 
Business sophomore Adam Weiss, 
a representative for the Business 
School, said they felt as though 
this was a subject that was impor-
tant to representatives’ constitu-
ents and thus should have been 
addressed at the meeting.

Reporter says 

Chinese government 

hid the infamous 

incident

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Though it likely means she will 

not be allowed to return to China 
for years, Louisa Lim, a former 
NPR and BBC correspondent, told 
students Tuesday that exposing 
details about a shrouded massacre 
that occurred almost 30 years ago 
in the country made it worth it.

Lim was a correspondent for 

both media outlets and is a current 
Howard R. Marsh visiting profes-
sor of journalism. She lectured 
on her new book, “The People’s 
Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen 
Revisited,” Tuesday evening in 
the Michigan League. Her book 
focuses on a culture of silence that 
exists in China concerning the 
Tiananmen Square massacre and 
the Chinese government’s ensuing 
cover-up.

She also touched on a series of 

similar protests at the same time 
in another Chinese city to which 
the government responded more 
openly.

In 1989, students held politi-

cal demonstrations in Tiananmen 

Square after the death of Hu Yao-
bang, the former general secretary 
of the Communist Party of China 
and a government reformist.

During their protests, the stu-

dents asked for freedom of speech, 
freedom of the press and better 
opportunities for workers, includ-
ing more control over industry 
practices. Groups had been pro-
testing for seven weeks, inciting 
protests in more than 400 other 
cities. On June 4, the Chinese 
government intervened, institut-
ing martial law and killing an 
unknown number of demonstra-
tors.

In China, the massacre is 

referred to as the Tiananmen 
Square “incident” when spoken 
about. It is still not known how 
many people were killed on June 
4, 1989.

Lim said that throughout the 

time she spent working on her 
book in China, she was terrified 
the Chinese government would 
detain her. She kept all of her notes 
on a laptop that had never been 
connected to the Internet, and 
locked the laptop in a safe at night. 
She was even unable call her editor 
to say she had decided to focus on 
the topic for her book until she left 
the country months later.

“I was terrified,” Lim said. “I 

was convinced that I would be 
detained or arrested the whole 
time I was asking things on cam-

puses, wandering around with this 
picture of ‘tank man’ I had sweaty 
hands.”

Her lecture began by show-

ing the infamous photo of a pro-
tester standing in front of a line of 
tanks. Though this photograph is 
recognized by most in the West-
ern world, Lim said it is largely 
unknown in China. When she 
went to four of the top universities 
in Beijing and polled 100 students, 
just 15 percent could recognize the 
photograph as being taken during 
the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Lim said this results from the 

extreme media censorship the 
government practices.

“If you search Tiananmen on 

Google, you will immediately 
get pictures of ‘tank man’ and 
descriptions of what happened in 
1989,” Lim said. “If you search on 
the Chinese equivalent you’ll get 
photos of Tiananmen Square and 
tourist information.”

Lim said the government went 

as far as to block the search of 
“2^6” because it equals 64 — short-
hand for June 4 — the day of the 
massacre. The only time the 1989 
event is taught in school is in col-
lege courses for history majors, 
and even then, Lim said that in a 
500-page textbook, just four pages 
mentioned it.

is enforced by the University and 
Michigan State Law. 

According 
to 
the 
Student 

Sexual Misconduct Policy, consent 
is 
“Clear 
and 
unambiguous 

agreement, expressed in mutually 
understandable words or actions, 
to engage in a particular activity. 
Consent can be withdrawn by 
either party at any point.” 

The 
definition 
provided 
by 

SAPAC on its website goes further, 
saying body language or silence do 
not constitute consent; only words 
do. 

Though 
Campbell 
testified 

she never verbally said “no,” she 
stated both in her testimony in the 
criminal preliminary examination 
and in a letter to the University’s 

appeals board that she asked 

to leave the room before the alleged 
assault took place. The testimonies 
of 
both 
Barnet 
and 
Reuben 

corroborate Campbell’s statement, 
though all three disagree about 
the exact way in which she asked 
to leave and how they responded 
when she asked.

“After 10 minutes in the room, 

things felt scary and wrong,” 
Campbell wrote in a letter to the 
appeals board. “I asked to leave and 
was told ‘no’ by Mr. Reuben. After 
that, I froze. Did nothing to protect 
myself, just froze. There was no 
way to fight, no where to flee. I 
do not know how to explain that 
reaction. Something just takes over 
and you just want to live.”

Campbell 
argued 
Barnet 

and 
Reuben 
had 
malicious, 

premeditated plans to engage in 
sexual behaviors with her.

Barnet testified he offered to 

leave the room but was told he 
could stay, according to the OIE 
investigation documents.

According to Elizabeth Seney, 

an OIE investigator, in the OIE’s 
investigation report, Reuben said, 
“She could have left at any time” and 
testified that he did not remember 
the complainant asking to leave the 
room. 

SAPAC’s website includes a list 

of five definitions of what does not 
qualify as consent. Among them 
is “Silence is never consent. If a 
person does not verbally say no, it 
does not mean that they mean yes.” 
The literature also says, “It is never 
acceptable to assume that consent is 
given. Each one of us is responsible 
for making sure we have consent in 
every sexual situation. If you are 
unsure, it is important to clarify 
what your partner is feeling about 
the sexual situation. Consent can 
never simply be assumed.”

However, 
the 
investigation 

and the appeals board found that 
because Campbell did not provide 
verbal dissent at any 

point, the incident could not be 
considered sexual assault because 
the men involved would have had 
no way of knowing their actions 
were unwanted.

In response to this argument, 

and to the appeals documents 
Campbell submitted, the appeals 
board wrote:

“Complainant 
contends 
that 

the training and documentation 
about sexual misconduct provided 
by SAPAC to all students, which 
encourages students engaging in 
sexual acts to solicit and receive 
affirmative 
verbal 
consent, 

constitutes 
the 
University’s 

policy on sexual misconduct. We 

understand 
why 
Complainant 

is 
espousing 
the 
affirmative 

verbal consent standard, and we 
are sympathetic to her reasons. 
However, the ‘Policy on Sexual 
Misconduct by Students’ that OIE 
and this Board are obligated to 
apply states otherwise.”

According to documents from 

the OIE investigation, a text 
message 
conversation 
between 

Barnet and Reuben from the night 
of Dec. 6 consists of a discussion 
about whether Barnet should leave 
the dorm room, and Reuben said 
he was already “hooking up” with 
Campbell on their way back to the 
dorm. The conversation continued, 
and Reuben and Barnet discussed 
how to set up the room to make a 

“threesome” 
possible.

Once 

Campbell 
and 

Reuben returned, 

Reuben 
texted, 

“Should I make a move 

right now,” to which Barnet replied, 
“Let’s try this turn lamps on lights 
off. Trust me it is def doable,” and 
a minute later, “Ok now I will sit on 
couch and u sit on couch too. On 
opposite sides tell her to koi. Join.”

In a letter to the appeals board, 

Campbell said the text messages 
retrieved 
from 
Barnet’s 
and 

Reuben’s phones show that she 
was not aware of the plans they 
were making. She said this signifies 
they knew she was unwilling to 
participate in the activity they were 
discussing. 

“If they thought I would consent, 

they would have been talking to 
me instead of secretly texting each 
other,” Campbell wrote. 

In her appeals letter, Campbell 

also wrote, “The defendants are 
hoping you will not notice how they 
plotted for hours by text before 
trapping me in their dormitory 
room, nor do they want you to see 
the forensic and physical evidence 
and witness testimony, all of which 
corroborates my story. 
 

 
 
 

Campbell said she froze and 

was silent at the time of the alleged 
assault — a reaction she said was 
considered a common response 
to sexual assault by University 
witnesses. Appeals documents 
from the respondents, however, 
show expert witnesses hired by 
Reuben and Barnet to testify during 
the 
University’s 
proceedings 

refuted these arguments.

In a letter submitted to the 

University for review by the appeals 
board, the lawyers representing the 
respondents argued that the central 
issue in this case is whether or not 
Campbell did or said anything that 
would have indicated she did not 
wish to engage in sexual activity.

“If Emily failed to do or say 

something to communicate lack 
of consent, the fact that after 
the fact she experienced some 
psychological reaction (such as, e.g. 
PTSD) is of no relevance from the 
point of view of what the boys saw 
and heard or what consent Emily 
did or did not give at the time,” the 
statement read.

In the letter to the appeals board, 

Campbell expressed her frustration 
with the University’s decision to 
allow the respondents to use their 
own expert witnesses — an issue 
Mortellaro said is just one example 
of inequity during the investigation 
of her daughter’s complaint.

Expert witness Suzanne Rotolo, 

a certified forensic nurse and 
certified 
medical 
investigator, 

testified that none of the injuries 
Campbell sustained are definitive 
for sexual assault. Katherine Okla, 
a clinical psychologist, and Roger 
Pitman, a psychiatrist, were also 
among those that presented their 
opinions to the OIE during their 
investigation.

Mortellaro said she initially 

chose not to hire a lawyer for her 
daughter after being told by the 
University’s investigator Elizabeth 

Seney that seeking outside counsel 
was 
unnecessary 
during 
the 

University’s investigation.

Seney referred an interview 

request 
to 
the 

University’s Office of Public Affairs.

Mortellaro said the respondents 

used financial wealth to avoid 
taking 
responsibility 
for 
their 

actions. During an investigation 
of this nature, the University is 
responsible for finding witnesses to 
review evidence from the case. The 
University did in Campbell’s case, 
and in response, the respondents’ 
lawyers presented testimony from 
hired expert witnesses.

“The University should not rely 

on paid witnesses from either side, 
because it just inherently makes the 
playing field uneven,” Mortellaro 
said. “It makes the richest person 
have their vision of the truth 
presented to be considered as 
opposed 
to 
unpaid, 
unbiased 

opinions.”

These three expert witnesses 

were hired by the respondents 
“to assess the opinions of the 
University’s experts,” according 
to documents included in OIE’s 
investigation, submitted by the 
respondents’ lawyers. 

People who are approved by 

a judge as expert witnesses — 
typically based on their education 
or specialized knowledge — are 
often hired to provide testimony 

in 
court 

proceedings. 
It 
is 

unclear 
how 
the 
University 

governs expert witnesses during 
disciplinary proceedings. 

The 
respondents 
said 
the 

nurse examiner mishandled the 
physical evidence. They alleged 
that the University’s psychological 
expert was “incorrect in her 
understanding of how memories 
are formed and retrieved, and the 
effect trauma may have on memory 
formation and recall.” 

“The opinions of experts the 

University has chosen to employ 
simply do not address any question 
that is at issue in this case. However, 

because the University has chosen 
to introduce ‘expert’ testimony to 
support Emily’s claim that she was 
sexually assaulted, the defense has 

retained 
three 
experts 
in 

the 
field 

of 
SANE 

examinations, memory formation, 
and PTSD to assess the opinions 
of the University’s experts,” the 
respondents’ lawyers wrote. 

The SANE nurse documented 

physical 
evidence, 
particularly 

a certain laceration, which the 
nurse described as a key indicator 
of sexual assault. Despite these 
injuries, one of the witnesses used 
by the respondents said, “This 
injury is no longer considered 
a ‘hallmark of sexual assault,’ ” 
and 
the 
document 
continues 

to say their witnesses said the 
injuries Campbell sustained could 
have been the result of many 
possibilities, including consensual 
or nonconsensual intercourse or 
trauma induced by the examiner. 

J. Samuel Holtz, Washtenaw 

County 
assistant 
prosecutor, 

prosecuted the case in district 
court. In an interview with the 
Daily, Holtz said the SANE report 
was not something that would have 
been used in the criminal case’s 
preliminary exam. In the district 
court procedures, SANE reports 

are only used to 
show that sexual 
contact occurred, 
he said.

“What a SANE 

report 
cannot 

show, except in 
the most extreme 

circumstances 

where 
there’s 

significant injuries or 

that type of thing, is a 

SANE report cannot show whether 
or not something was consensual or 
whether it was forced,” Holtz said.

Another 
piece 
of 
contested 

evidence included a letter written 
during 
the 
appeals 
process 

by Cavanaugh, which was not 
admitted for consideration by the 
appeals board. 

In this letter, which was written 

after 
the 
original 
University 

investigation 
was 
completed, 

Cavanaugh 
summarized 
his 

findings for the use of the appeals 
board as they considered revising 
the University’s original decision 
to find Reuben and Barnet not 
responsible for sexual assault.

“On the night of the incident, Lt. 

Neumann (now University Police 
Chief Robert Neumann) with over 
20 years of police experience and I 
thought there was enough probable 
cause to believe a criminal sexual 
assault 
occurred,” 
Cavanaugh 

wrote. 
“The 
investigation 
by 

Elizabeth Seney was very thorough 
and filled with details. But finding 

a formal internal University investigation in accordance with the 
University’s publicly available process for handling reported sexual 
assaults. 

The University’s Office of Public Affairs offered to schedule an 

interview with Wallesby on Tuesday, which they did, but it was 
ultimately canceled by Fitzgerald.

“Upon further consideration and hearing your several follow-up 

questions, I am afraid we will not be able to come to the Daily this 
afternoon to respond to your questions,” he wrote in an e-mail.

Campbell said she reported the incident to a confidential 

employee at SAPAC and also chose to have a rape kit administered 
at the University Hospital. Whereas confidential employees — such 
as SAPAC volunteers — are permitted to keep their conversations 
private if requested by the alleged victim, University employees are 
required to report any incidents of sexual assault when they become 
aware of them. As a result, hospital employees are mandated to report 
incidents of sexual assault to the University, as they did in Campbell’s 
case. The University was then obligated to pursue the issue and 
decide whether the case would be investigated.

The University’s Student Sexual Misconduct Policy was last 

updated August 19, 2013, four months before Campbell’s alleged 

assault took place. The process for Campbell’s case followed this 
updated policy. 

Four criteria must be met for a respondent to be found responsible 

for some form of sexual misconduct through the Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy, according to the final and appeals process 
reviewed by the Daily. First, the investigation must establish that 
sexual contact did occur. Second, the encounter must violate the 
University’s Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Third, 
the encounter must have been unwanted by someone involved. Lastly, 

the party responsible for the unwanted 

sexual acts must have been aware 

that those actions were unwanted — 
requiring a verbal dissent expressed 
by one of those involved.

According to the documents 

reviewed by the Daily, the first 
three criteria were met in 
Campbell’s case but not the 
fourth. During the investigation, 
neither 
Campbell 
nor 
the 

respondents testify that she said “no” 

or asked the respondents to stop at any time during the alleged assault.

However, Campbell maintains that the contact was not consensual. 
There are four different avenues through which Campbell’s case 

has been investigated: the University’s OIE-conducted investigation, 
which included a review by an appeals board after the initial decision 
was made to find the respondents not responsible for the alleged 
assault; a criminal case filed in the 14A District Court; an ongoing 
civil case filed in the Washtenaw County Circuit Court; and an 
investigation by the U.S. Department of Education.

The University found Barnet and Reuben responsible for taking 

and disseminating compromising photographs on the night of the 
alleged assault without Campbell’s consent. The University did not 
find them responsible for sexual assault. 

During the preliminary examination of the criminal case, in which 

Barnet and Reuben were charged with first-degree criminal sexual 
conduct, District Court Judge Richard Conlin determined there was 
not enough evidence to go forward with a trial.

Campbell’s civil lawsuit against Barnet and Reuben alleges eight 

different counts, including assault and battery, criminal sexual 
contact and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 

On April 1, the attorneys for both Barnet and Reuben filed 

motions for dismissal of the civil case. David Nacht, an 
attorney representing Barnet, argued in his brief: “The 
simple truth is that no matter how many times Ms. 
Campbell brings the same claims, Defendants 
cannot be responsible for sexual assault where her 
actions did not manifest any lack of consent.”

Judge Timothy Connors has not ruled on their 

motion. 

Campbell’s case raises a central question: What 

is consent? Is a verbal dissent required to signal 
unwanted contact, as in the University’s policy, or, 
as taught by SAPAC, does a sexual action require 
an affirmative “yes” to satisfy consent?

The University’s final decision found the respondents not 

responsible for sexual assault, arguing that they were never made 
aware their actions were unwanted since Campbell never explicitly 
said “no.”

John Shea, an attorney representing Reuben, cited a document 

written by Campbell to the Appeals Board that he says demonstrates 
a misunderstanding of how consent is defined for the purposes of the 
University’s sexual assault investigation process. 

“She even cites the reader to SAPAC’s definition of consent, which 

is not the University’s definition or that adopted in state law,” Shea 
wrote in a statement to the Daily. “There may be a larger social 
problem in this country related to sexual assault, but you cannot from 
that draw any parallel to this case when there’s abundant proof that 
these boys in no way assaulted a fellow student.”

This discrepancy is seen in what is taught by SAPAC and what

commenced. OIE found Reuben and 
Barnet in violation of University 
policy for disseminating electronic 
images of Campbell during the event 
without her knowledge, but did not 
find them responsible for unwanted 
sexual contact. Reuben and Barnet 
were suspended from the University 
for one year and will be allowed to 
return to campus in January 2016, 
pending the fulfillment of proba-
tionary stipulations.

Part One: 

Equitability of the process

The University has a right to con-

duct its misconduct investigations 
independently. However, OIE inves-
tigative proceedings must be altered 
to include safeguards that increase 
the equitability of the process and 
allow individuals a more just oppor-
tunity to file, pursue and defend any 
claims made by or against them.

The Student Sexual Misconduct 

Policy explicitly states that both 
respondents and complainants “may 
bring a support person or adviser 
with them to any meetings with 
the Investigator” handling the OIE 
investigation. However, there is 
no specific policy in existence gov-
erning whether complainants are 
advised to seek legal counsel, and 
Fitzgerald declined to elaborate fur-
ther as to what standard procedure 
entails. Both Reuben and Barnet 
retained high-quality legal repre-
sentation at the onset of the process, 
while Campbell did not retain attor-
ney services until she decided to 
press civil charges 11 months later.

Leaving the decision to retain 

counsel up to students who are 
involved with a stressful and likely 
emotionally damaging investiga-
tion could lead to a situation where 
ill-equipped individuals are pitted 
against experienced attorneys using 
experts to discredit and counter 
their claims. A system that provides 
guaranteed representation for all 
individuals involved with an OIE 
investigation must be created to 
ensure equitability.

In addition to the retention of 

legal representation, paid expert 
testimony and analysis is allowed 
in the OIE investigation process. 
The OIE investigator in charge of 
the case consulted various experts 
for 
the 
investigation, 
including 

the SANE who examined Camp-
bell and a University psycholo-
gist 
with 
post-traumatic 
stress 

disorder expertise. In response to 
these 
University-obtained 
testi-

monies, Reuben’s attorneys paid 
and consulted experts regarding 
the SANE examination, memory 
formation and PTSD to directly 
contradict the informed opinions 
of University employees. The allow-
ance of this testimony is concern-
ing. To maintain a standard of 
review, it is crucial that the opinions 
considered do not harbor a vested 
interest in the outcome of any con-
tended issue, as is the case with paid 
 

expert opinions.

OIE investigations include an 

appeals process that allows new, 
“appropriate and probative” mate-
rial to be introduced after an appeal 
has been filed. This is entirely con-

tradictory to the purpose of an 
appeal. An appeal is a review of 
an original decision to determine 
whether a “harmful legal error 
has occurred”; it is not intended to 
“give a litigant a second opportuni-
ty to reargue the facts of his or her 
case.” Complainants and respon-
dents are allowed to submit objec-
tions to materials during the appeals 
process, which are considered and 
ruled upon by OIE staff. Permitting 
additional documents to be submit-
ted during an appeal only muddles 
the factual findings of the Univer-
sity’s investigation and unneces-
sarily complicates and elongates 
 

the process.

Furthermore, the policies gov-

erning students and their actions 
bear few definitive thresholds for 
punishment. The University only 
provides a list of potential sanc-
tions, meaning very few violations 
of policy result directly in a spe-
cifically defined punishment being 
levied against violator(s). Alarm-
ingly, academic standing policy 
is more concrete in its language 
and 
punishments 
than 
sexual 

assault policies. Leaving punish-
ments undefined limits the abil-
ity of University policy to inhibit 
 

unwanted behavior.

Punishments aren’t just unde-

fined. They are, as in Campbell’s 
case, mercurial. E. Royster Harper, 
vice president of student life, after 
reviewing the materials from the 
OIE investigation and suggested 
sanctioning from the appeals pro-
cess, wrote in a Dec. 17, 2014 memo 
addressed to Stacey Vander Velde, 
associate director of the Office of 
Student Conflict Resolution, that 
she had “chosen to modify the 
sanctioning recommendations” by 
extending the suspension period 
levied against Reuben; he will not 
be allowed to return to the Uni-
versity until January 2016. This 
was done without explanation or 
rationalization by Harper or her 
office, which further raises ques-
tions about the transparency of 
 

the process.

Reworking the OIE investigation 

system is essential because it will 
benefit both the University and stu-
dents, leading to a more equitable 
process and definitive outcome.

Part Two: Consent definition 

and sexual education

According to its website, SAPAC, 

the main campus provider of sex-
ual education, defines consent as 
“when someone verbally agrees, 
gives permission, or says ‘yes’ to 
sexual activity with someone else.” 
However, the Student Sexual Mis-
conduct Policy defines consent with 
less detailed description. It states 
that consent is “clear and unam-
biguous agreement, expressed in 
mutually understandable words or 
actions, to engage in a particular 
activity,” with the key issue being 
“whether the Respondent knew, or 
should have known, that the activ-
ity in question was not consensual.” 
Because of the University’s official 
policy, Reuben and Barnet were 
found not guilty of unwanted sex-
ual contact during the encounter 
with Campbell. While we under-
stand that SAPAC’s definition of 
consent is educational and not a 
standard used to hold individuals 
accountable to University policy, 
the large discrepancy between the 
two is troubling; “mutually under-
standable words or actions” is too 
ambiguous. The current policy sets 
a dangerously low threshold for 
consent that can be misconstrued 
and misunderstood.

To remedy these ambiguities, 

the policy should clearly state that 
silence and inaction are not accept-

able and do not, under any circum-
stances, 
constitute 
consent. 
In 

an interview with The Michigan 
Daily, Barbara Niess-May, execu-
tive director of SafeHouse Center, 
further elaborated on the topic of 
consent. “It’s active, not passive,” 
Niess-May said. “Cooperation does 
not equal consent.”

According to the American Psy-

chological Association, immediate 
reactions to sexual assault include 
shock, disbelief and fear. While 
the lack of a response, as a result 
of these reactions, can cause con-
fusion for involved parties, misun-
derstanding is not a viable excuse 
for sexual misconduct. The Univer-
sity’s policy must take into account 
the very real, biological reactions 
individuals may experience during 
a traumatic event.

Beyond the pitfalls in the policy 

itself, sexual education on cam-
pus is minimal, at best. Currently, 
the University administers sexual 
education to incoming students 
indirectly 
through 
AlcoholEdu 

and directly through Relationship 
Remix. However, completion of 
these programs is fail>not strict-
ly enforced, and neither of the 
programs detail the University’s 
sexual misconduct policy nor the 
investigative process. These pro-
grams are not rigorous enough 
educational tools because, even if 
enforced, such brief sessions can’t 
cover all of the material necessary 
for an adequate understanding of 
sexual misconduct.

Therefore, the University must 

provide SAPAC with more resourc-
es to expand its educational pro-
grams for students. For students, 
a more thorough and prolonged 
curriculum should be taught to 
provide a comprehensive and con-
tinual education. A mini-course 
should be mandated for freshmen 
during their first semester aimed 
at clarifying all policies and pun-
ishments regarding sexual miscon-
duct. In addition, online refreshers 
should be mandated before class 
registration each academic year 
to provide updated information 
regarding 
sexual 
misconduct 

resources and policy.

That said, it would be unfair 

to claim the University is com-
pletely uncommitted to changing 
campus culture and policies. Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel 
has announced a student survey 
on sexual assault to gather infor-
mation, UMPD has formed a sex-
ual assault special victims unit 
focused on sexual misconduct and 
SAPAC is currently hosting round 
tables to provide feedback on the 
sexual misconduct policy. While 
these steps will improve aware-
ness, gather information and bet-
ter train UMPD officers — all 
critical to tackling sexual mis-
conduct — they do not adequately 
address the issues that currently 
exist within the system, the policy 
and how information is dissemi-
nated on campus.

The University must own up to 

its faults and make integral chang-
es to its OIE investigation process, 
sexual misconduct policy and edu-
cation programs. Further inaction 
in this regard cannot be tolerated.

A

nother April is upon us, which means 
another Hash Bash is behind us. As 
the cleanup crews get to work try-

ing to get the Diag ready for 
another week of classes, the 
entire student body needs a 
gentle reminder to help keep 
this area pristine for all of us. 
However, it’s not the trash I’m 
talking about (though the out-
of-towners bring a lot, damn 
dirty hippies), but the noise 
pollution.

Yes, it’s just about that time 

for the campus hate-mongers 
to make an appearance. If this isn’t your first 
semester, then you know exactly who I’m talk-
ing about: the angry man with his sandwich 
board, spewing hate and vitriol to anyone who 
will listen; the guy who argues with him while 
hocking his own book and performing a few 
weird magic tricks; or just about any imagin-
able kind of gospel-preachin’, soul-savin’ out-
door evangelist.

Regardless, when you break all of them 

down into their constituent parts, they’re 
here spreading a message 
of hate, intolerance and/or 
exclusivity, and that is the 
polar opposite of what cam-
pus should be. Anyone car-
rying around a sign that says 
“Repent or die,” “Ask me 
why you’re going to be cast 
into a lake of fire” or “Obey 
Jesus” isn’t coming at you 
with an attitude of love or 
respect (again, except Magic 
Guy, and he’s just here for your cash — though 
at least he’s honest about it).

Don’t get me wrong; I love a good campus 

preacher. One of the first groups I associ-
ated with, the campus Atheists, Agnostics & 
Humanists at Western Michigan University 
— presently the Center for Inquiry — origi-
nally congregated around a campus preacher. 
Then again, what they had at WMU we lack 
here at the University; mainly, a strong-
willed, intelligent group that could factually, 
and loudly, counter anything that gets tossed 
around — and do it in a way that isn’t overly 
insulting or condescending.

And that is a problem here on the Diag. Sure, 

we have plenty of people who will yell at the 
guy, but all they’re doing is playing into his 
hands. This preacher isn’t doing anything spe-
cial, per se, but a lot of this goes back to the facts 
that we just don’t have many older students 
here, and campus religious diversity always 
seems to revolve around some sort of god (as I 
have noted before).

Unfortunately, the Diag is technically 

considered a public space, so they are well 

within their rights to preach their message 
of hate — or magic and books, depending on 
the source. But there are a few things we can 
do to combat this nuisance. One tried-and-
true response is for a well read, free thinker 
to stand out there, to heckle him back while 
winning over the crowd, until the preacher 
gets irritated and goes away. However, lack-
ing a 350-pound man with a booming voice, 
quick wit and a powder blue t-shirt that reads 
“Friendly Neighborhood Atheist” — and we 
are lacking that on campus, trust me — the 
best thing we can do is ignore him.

I know, much easier to ignore such a spec-

tacle. Students naturally congregate around 
these people. Honestly, we’ve all done it. In 
fact, I stopped and watched one about this 
time last year. I probably should have spoken 
up, but I was underprepared, and that’s the 
last thing you want to be when dealing with 
these loons. “Never argue with an idiot. They 
will drag you down to their level and beat you 
with experience,” as the saying goes.

Then again, as much as I say we should 

ignore them, I also have some weird fantasies 
about these people getting their comeuppance. 

I mean, wouldn’t it be fan-
tastic if the circle of people 
around one of them just spon-
taneously turned around and 
started talking to the people 
behind them, alienating the 
preacher in the midst of a 
large group of people? Or if a 
couple of them started some 
sort of preacher rap battle, 
and we were on hand to judge 
it, complete with scorecards? 

I’d love to see sandwich board guy try to spit a 
rhyme — I bet it would be hysterical.

Anyhow, remember they are not there to 

be nice or make friends, no matter what they 
say. They are here for self-serving ends, to get 
attention and money, whether it be American 
dollars or spiritual spending power for the 
afterlife. Be vigilant around these con men, 
and stay out of their money trap.

Finally, whatever you do when you see 

these guys, make sure you don’t get violent 
or make threats. All of these things play into 
their hands, and the last thing we want is to 
give them more self-righteous fury. Instead, 
smile and walk away. If they have no crowd, 
they have no currency, and they will quickly 
move along to the next group of “suckers.” Let 
them say what they came to say, and then let 
them leave. The sooner they get the message 
that we don’t care, the sooner they’ll go away 
and the sooner we’ll go back to having a nicer, 
cleaner Diag.

‘Dead’ end opens 
onto new world

RADIUS-TWC

‘The Hunting Ground’ explores the facts and fictions of campus sexual assault.
Confronting sexism 
in Greek life cinema 

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

Human beings categorize each 

other for convenience; it’s a way 
to make a complex world easier to 
understand. When we stereotype, 
we don’t take into account individu-
al differences. But how about when 
the subjects of our daunting world 
put themselves into uncomplicated 
boxes for us?

Greek life in college does just 

this. It allows people to have the 
ability to describe 50 to 70 people 
using a few derogatory words. “The 
Hunting Ground,” a documentary 
about the severity of sexual assault 
on college campuses, devotes a 
portion of its run time to illustrate 
the problem of rape in American 
fraternities. Sitting in the theater, 
listening to statistics and personal 
accounts of Greek life, the charac-
ters created realistic identities for 
people whom I didn’t even know.

The classic sorority girl stereo-

types are often prevalent in mov-
ies, but few are so overwhelming 
as “Legally Blonde,” a film about 
Elle Woods, (Reese Witherspoon, 
“Wild”), president of her soror-
ity’s chapter, who follows her boy-
friend to Harvard Law School. 
Elle eventually realizes that she 
is more than her sorority’s let-
ters, but her friends continue to be 
portrayed as well-dressed, mani-
cured morons.

More recently, “The House 

Bunny” and “Sydney White” cre-
ate an obvious binary between the 
mean and exclusive sorority girls 
who are portrayed as the “bitchy” 
and “slutty” villains juxtaposed 

with the sweet “I’m not like others” 
girls who are allowed to care about 
other things, but who are often val-
ued for their non-sexual innocence.

The female characters in these 

movies encourage the sexism of 
the system of Greek life. These ste-
reotypes let people say that they’re 
all the same; they’re dumb; they’re 
“basic.” Sometimes even women 
who don’t participate in Greek life 
fall into this trap; they don’t want to 
be identified with what the “soror-
ity girl” has come to represent, so 
they join the ranks of people who 
look down on them.

Ask anyone on campus, even 

someone not affiliated with Greek 
life in any way, to give you one to 
two words describing a certain 
sorority and they can do it without 
hesitation. But we can’t describe 
“other” people in one to two words 
as easily. And these stereotypes 
perpetuate the idea that we can take 
multi-faceted humans and turn 
them into “basic” things that don’t 
deserve respect. By taking away the 
humanity of these women, we take 
away incentive for others to treat 
them like real people. This depreci-
ation of sorority sisters contributes 
to hazy understandings of consent 
– if someone isn’t seen as deserv-
ing of a voice, they are not seen as 
deserving of control over their own 
body.

Men also become victims of 

misogyny in the cinematic por-
trayal of Greek life. In films like 
“Neighbors,” 
fraternity 
broth-

ers are depicted as beer-guzzling 
“basic bros” whose main objec-
tive in life is to sleep with as many 
women as possible. However, their 

stereotypes are fundamentally dif-
ferent from those of sorority girls, 
because when they adhere to their 
social norms, they are celebrated – 
laughed with and not at. The main 
frat boys are never characterized as 
villainous or dangerous. The issue 
of sexual assault is rarely touched 
upon in the web of Greek life 
interpretations. The most preva-
lent example is in the satirical film 
“Animal House”, when, after much 
internal debate, a fraternity charac-
ter does not rape a passed out girl 
and he is lionized as a hero.

Greek life itself may or may not 

be inherently sexist, but its por-
trayal in films almost always is. One 
of the statistics in “The Hunting 
Ground” points out that the popu-
lation of rapists is small in compari-
son with the number of people who 
experience sexual assault, because 
the majority of men who do rape 
will be repeat offenders. However, 
because of the stereotypes that 
films perpetuate about sorority sis-
ters as being hypersexualized and 
vapid, it makes it easier to not take 
them seriously and guiltlessly com-
mit crimes against them.

The gorgeous houses in the 

inevitable montages of films about 
Greek life are built brick by misogy-
nist brick. The worst part is that 
we take those constructions at face 
value and we use them to judge 
people in our actual lives. But with 
films like “The Hunting Ground” 
that tell the stories of individual 
girls and frankly discuss facts about 
the correlation between Greek life 
and rape culture, we can see the 
structure of sexism slowly crum-
bling.

Rick Grimes goes 

all the way in 

season five closer

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Early in season five of “The 

Walking 
Dead,” 
Abraham 

(Michael Cudlitz, “Band of 
Brothers”) 
wrote, 
“The 

new 
world’s 

gonna 
need 

Rick Grimes.” 
But, can Rick 
(Andrew Lin-
coln, 
“Strike 

Back”) survive 
in 
the 
new 

world? 
That’s 

the 
question 

that drove the 
second half of AMC’s hit series 
as it found its group of survivors 
struggling to adjust to the set-
tlement of Alexandria, a place 
mostly untouched by the hor-
rors outside.

If any quote encapsulates Rick’s 

philosophy in the apocalypse, it 
would come from fellow AMC 
series “Breaking Bad” ’s Mike 
Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), 
who said, “I chose a half measure, 
when I should have gone all the 
way. I’ll never make that mistake 
again.” Rick has learned this les-
son more than once. He lost his 
wife (Sarah Wayne Callies,”Prison 
Break”) when he left an enemy’s 
fate to chance and then his men-
tor (Scott Wilson, “In Cold Blood”) 
when he let the Governor (David 
Morissey, “Extant”) get away 
at the end of season three. This 
message continues to resonate as 
the threat of Terminus returns to 
attack an already weakened group 
in the first three episodes of season 
five. All this leads to a pragmatic 
leader, unafraid to take the brutal 
steps needed to survive. However, 
within the sheltered community of 
Alexandria, Rick is a product of a 
completely different world.

Set in the aftermath of Rick’s 

violent confrontation with the 
abusive Pete (Corey Brill, “The 
Normal Heart”) and his sub-
sequent gun-waving rant, the 
season five finale, “Conquer,” 
questions Rick’s place in a civi-
lized community. Glenn (Steve 
Yeun, “The Legend of Korra”) 
openly questions Rick’s resolve 
to violently take Alexandria 
if he is voted out, comparing 

his plan of butchery displayed 
by the residents of Terminus. 
However, “The Walking Dead” 
could have looked even farther 
back into its history to find the 
strongest comparison – season 
two’s Shane (Jon Bernthal, “The 
Wolf of Wall Street”), Rick’s for-
mer friend turned rival. Shane 
displays many of the traits that 
Rick currently possesses: Aha-
rah survival instinct, the need 
to strike first and a problematic 
relationship with another man’s 
wife. The show paints Rick in a 
light compared to the eventual 
condemnation 
Shane 
faces, 

which demonstrates how far 
characters have been pushed.

In 
particular, 
“Conquer” 

pushes not only Rick, but Glenn 
and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-
Green, “Once Upon a Time”) 
to points they could never turn 
away from. Glenn faces death 
at the hands of the cowardly 
Nicholas 
(Michael 
Traynor, 

“Rectify”) while Sasha, who 
struggles to come to grips 
with the deaths of her brother 
and boyfriend (Chad L. Cole-
man and Lawrence Gilliard Jr., 
“The Wire”), is confronted by 
the hypocritical Father Gabriel 
(Seth Gilliam, “The Wire”). 
Both confrontations conclude 
with Glenn and Sasha point-
ing guns at their attackers, and 
both times, the show walks 
them away from the ledge. It’s a 
mixed-bag in term of dramatic 
results; while it’s enjoyable to 
see the usually nihilistic series 
give hope to its characters, 
there’s a sense of anticlimax, 

much like the downbeat mid-
season finale, “Coda.”

On a lighter note, it’s awesome 

to see the return of Morgan 
(Lennie James, “Low Winter 
Sun”) and his newfound Zen 
warrior philosophy and fighting 
style. Back on Rick’s side, there 
is sometimes a little too much 
justification on its protagonist 
side. The show has seen Rick 
walk the line between sanity 
and insanity multiple times, as 
Lincoln gives the character an 
undercurrent of dark madness 
that always risks coming forth. 
However, the show’s writers 
seem to be more cautious in 
embracing that darker side. 
Several characters defend Rick, 
like Abraham eloquently says 
to the Alexandrians, “There’s 
a vast ocean of shit that you 
people don’t know shit about.” 
But, the show might go a little 
too far in its defense of Jessie 
(Alexandra 
Breckenbridge, 

“American 
Horror 
Story”), 

the woman Rick is at times 
disturbingly attached to, which 
only solidifies his importance.

However, when Rick comes 

forth with the body of a walker 
who sneaks in, the show states that 
the new world needs Rick Grimes, 
because in the words of “True 
Detective” ’s Rust Cohle, “The 
world needs bad men. We keep 
the other bad men from the door.” 
That’s why Rick kills Pete after he 
kills Reg (Steve Coulter, “The Con-
juring”). In “The Walking Dead,” 
survival can’t be compromised. 
This is a lesson Rick knows, and 
Alexandria needs to learn.

FILM NOTEBOOK

Barnet and Reuben not responsible 
for the criminal sexual assault of 
Emily Campbell is unfathomable. 
I could not respectfully disagree 
more with the final findings of the 
OIE investigation.” 

When contacted by the Daily, 

Cavanaugh said he wanted to 
discuss the case for this article, 
but his supervisor and Diane 
Brown, the Division of Public 
Safety and Security spokeswoman, 
prevented 
him 
from 
doing 

so. 
Brown 
said 
University 

Police Chief Robert Neumann 
was 
unavailable 
to 
answer 

questions 
Tuesday 
afternoon 

regarding the role of UMPD in 
these types of investigations or 
whether detectives are used as 
expert witnesses in University 
proceedings of this nature.

Timothy Lynch, University vice 

president and general counsel, 
wrote a letter to Campbell — which 
was reviewed by the Daily — in 
December 2014, stating that the 
OGC, OIE and OSCR had reviewed 
all 
the 
documents 
submitted 

by both the complainant and 
respondents “in light of continuing 
objections” raised by both parties.

“Detective Cavanaugh’s personal 

opinions on the findings of OIE, 
the credibility of the parties or the 
ultimate issue before the Appeals 
Board are neither relevant nor 
appropriate,” Lynch wrote. He 
elaborated to say Cavanaugh acted 
outside of University policies as an 
impartial investigator by sending 
his letter, and that his letter 
“cannot be characterized as new 
information.” 

In the letter, Lynch briefly 

explained what types of evidence 
are and aren’t used in University 
investigations. 

“The University of Michigan’s 

sexual misconduct policy and 
procedures are not designed to 
mimic the criminal justice system 
or civil litigation; they are student 
disciplinary 
proceedings,” 
he 

wrote. 

Lynch’s letter continued that 

while “formal rules of evidence do 
not apply,” the University attempts 
to keep the investigation fair to 
all parties, which might mean 
“disallowing proffered information 
from being considered.”

Other documents presented by 

the respondents in advance of the 
appeals process were also blocked 
from consideration. 

Jane 
Briggs-Bunting, 
an 

attorney and former director of the 
Michigan State University School 
of Journalism, said University 
disciplinary proceedings are often 
less formal than a criminal case, 
and standard rules of evidence do 
not generally apply. However, she 
said if the University is allowing 
one party to bring in extra 
witnesses, the other party should 
be notified.

Lynch could not be reached 

for comment on Tuesday, and the 
University’s Office of Public Affairs 
declined to make him available for 
an interview.

During the appeals process, 

Mortellaro said the respondents’ 
lawyers were meeting with various 
University 
officials 
and 
staff 

members to discuss this case.

The Daily attempted to confirm 

these meetings with Lynch, but he 
was unavailable for comment. The 
respondents’ lawyers also declined 

to comment on this matter.

“I think it’s highly unusual for 

generals counsel to be involved in 
student disciplinary proceedings 
and talking to attorneys on one 
side and excluding the party on the 
other side,” Briggs-Bunting said. 

Following a meeting with Stacy 

Vander Velde, associate director 
of OSCR, Mortellaro said she left 
with more questions than answers.

“I had a long conversation with 

(Vander Velde) and I just asked 
her what policy and procedure 
they were using to make these 
determinations and she said she 
had no idea, that it was all coming 
from the general counsel’s office, 
and later we found out that the 
respondents’ 
attorneys 
were 

having undue influence over the 
counsel. We were never made 
privy to that or allowed to respond 
in any way.”

The 
University’s 
Office 
of 

General Counsel is not mentioned 
in the University’s Policy on 
Student Sexual Misconduct, which 
lists offices such as OIE and OSCR 
that are traditionally involved in 
the proceedings. 

An OSCR staff member said 

Vander Velde was unavailable for 
comment on Tuesday, and the 
Office of Public Affairs declined to 
make a representative from OSCR 
available for comment.

Fitzgerald declined to discuss 

policy used to determine admissible 
evidence or testimony, referring 
the Daily to the University’s 
Student 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Policy. He also declined to discuss 
standard 
language 
used 
for 

advising students on hiring an 
attorney during the process, citing 
the Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy’s provision that students 

may have a “Support Person” 
participate in the process. The 
policy does not stipulate whether 
the University is required to 
notify the other party when 
a 
complainant 
or 
respondent 

involves a support person, such as 
an attorney.

“It’s just about equity, and that’s 

why we filed with the federal 
government,” 
Campbell 
said. 

“Their rule is that the University 
can decide either way as long as it is 
equal, but it wasn’t. You can’t pick 
and choose what evidence is seen.”

Part 
Four: 
Communication 

concerns

Campbell did not hire her own 

lawyer until November 2014, 11 
months after the alleged assault, 
when she decided to file a civil 
suit against Barnet and Reuben. 
The decision not to hire a lawyer, 
Mortellaro said, was made based 
on trust in the University’s process 
— trust she and Campbell said they 
feel the University abused. Because 
they were advised that they did 
not need a lawyer, Campbell and 
Mortellaro said, the investigation 
and appeals process was filled with 
miscommunication and confusion. 

“They told us it was completely 

unnecessary to have a lawyer 
to work through the University 
process,” Mortellaro said.

Nacht, the attorney representing 

Barnet, said he regularly represents 
women and men in the University’s 
sexual assault process. 

“It is normal for a student or for 

that matter a university faculty 
member or staff member going 
through the process to want the 
assistance of counsel,” he told the 
Daily in a statement. “The fact 
that women and men continue to 
contact our firm indicates that the 

need is there.”

Mortellaro 
said 
the 
status 

of Campbell’s case was always 
unclear during the appeals process.

“All of the sudden, this had gone 

up the chain of command, and no 
one could tell us why or who was 
making decisions, or what they 
were basing those decisions on,” 
Mortellaro added.

Prior to submitting Campbell’s 

request for appeal, however, the 
University was clear about its 
policy. As is publicly stated, the 
process did move in a predictable 
way, Campbell said. When the 
incident was originally reported, 
Campbell was offered a resolution 
by OSCR, which would have been 
to have the respondents complete 
an essay or come to some other 
informal agreement to solve the 
conflict, which Campbell rejected.

Once the University found the 

respondents not responsible for 
sexual assault, and after Campbell 
requested an appeal, both she 
and the respondents were able 
to submit any new, relevant 
information for the appeals board 
to review. After this, Mortellaro 
said everything seemed to come to 
a stop.

“There came a point in the 

appeals process where we went 
off of that flow chart and no one 
could answer why, and that’s 
when we discovered that the 
respondents’ 
attorneys 
were 

having 
private 
meetings 
and 

e-mails and conference calls with 
the general counsel’s office with 
the University,” Mortellaro said. 

The University’s Student Sexual 

Misconduct Policy states, “Upon 
receipt of a report, the University 
will strive to complete its review 
within sixty (60) calendar days.” 

Campbell reported the alleged 
assault on Dec. 6, 2013, and the 
review was completed on June 
26, 2014. The final report from the 
appeals board was issued on Dec. 
22, 2014 — more than a year after 
the alleged assault. The suggested 
timeline 
for 
completing 
the 

appellate process is within 15 days 
of the appeals board’s receipt of the 
appeal, and Campbell submitted 
her request for appeal on Sept. 29, 
2014, and received a final decision 
on Dec. 22, 2014. 

“I think the respondents have 

great legal representation and that 
they played the system beautifully,” 
Mortellaro said.

Mortellaro said she made 

numerous phone calls during 
the three-month period of the 
appeals 
board 
deliberations, 

including e-mailing and calling 
the office of University President 
Mark Schlissel multiple times 
asking to reflect on Campbell’s 
experience with the University’s 
process. The Daily could not 
confirm this, and Fitzgerald 
declined to comment.

While motions to dismiss the 

civil case are pending, Barnet 
and Reuben are able to return to 
campus as soon as January 2016. 
Their return to campus is pending 
their submission of a 2,000-word 
essay — which is to be based on 
a series of required readings 
provided by the University — 
and their attendance at multiple 
mandatory, individual meetings 
before and after their return 
to campus. They will be on 
disciplinary 
probation 
and 

are 
prohibited 
from 
having 

contact with Campbell for the 
remainder of her enrollment at 
the University.

Toro y Moi bores 
on latest release

New direction on 
‘What For?’ is a 

wrong turn

By YARDAIN AMRON

Daily Arts Writer

Before his third album Any-

thing in Return garnered the 
critical praise 
it did, before it 
even dropped 
Chaz Bundick, 
Toro 
y 
Moi, 

said 
— 
with 

the 
certainty 

of one David 
Foster Wallace 
on 
taking 
a 

cruise — that writing the album 
was fun, but he would never do 
it again.

“I’ve seen artists turn into 

characters, and I don’t want to 
become the ‘pop music guy,’ ” 
Bundick once said in an inter-
view 
with 
Pitchfork. 
“Pop 

music is awesome, but I like to 
keep changing it up … I’m not 
worried about repeating myself 
— I’m more worried that I’d just 
get bored.”

Sagacious words from the 

then-26-year-old. Boredom is a 
universal human fear no doubt. 
But unlike us common folk who 
cope with boredom’s chains 
via Facebook and Caribbean 
cruises, Bundick seems to have 
figured out how to evade the 
affliction altogether, at least 
musically … well, at least until 
now.

A brief tour: Listening to 

Bundick’s four records chrono-
logically is a testament to an 
artist who detests pigeons and 
dreads holes, and refuses to 
play in the neat genre boxes 
us critics create. The dreamy 
slink of his 2010 debut Causers 
of This — considered founda-
tional to the rise of chillwave 
— was followed starkly a year 
later by the velvety funk of 
Underneath the Pines, which 
proved Bundick could compose 

for more than a laptop. Then, 
in 2013, he released the weirdly 
danceable and unclassifiable 
Anything in Return, which Ian 
Cohen described on Pitchfork 
as a composite of everywhere 
Bundick had taken Toro y Moi 
to date.

“So there’s silky R&B, roll-

er-rink pop, bubblegum funk, 
tasteful chillout music, all uni-
fied by a voice that’s grown 
more confident with time,” 
Cohen wrote.

What 
For? 
is 
Bundick’s 

sharpest departure from every-
thing Toro y Moi has been, 
and his disappointing attempt 
at a throwback ’70s pop radio 
record. The album opens to the 
zoom of racecars on a track, 
speeds through ten songs in 
barely 36 minutes, and never 
really slows down to catch its 
breath. When the music stopped 
after my first listen-through, I 
kept waiting for it to start again, 
hoping Bundick had included a 
hidden track or something. It’s 
hard to believe this is the same 
guy who’s credited as a founder 
of chillwave.

My main bone with the 

album is its lack of a defin-

ing moment. Even the singles, 
“Buffalo” and “Empty Nest-
ers,” which have Bundick’s new 
band at its best, aren’t really 
memorable. And for all the time 
Bundick spent trying to write 
catchy melodies, there’s no song 
on the album truly tempting 
to return to, no refrain to stick 
in our heads, no groove that 
makes us want to dance, no real 
surprises. The album naturally 
fades to the background and 
doesn’t demand my attention. 
In a word, What For? is boring.

Call it hipsterness or what 

you like, but the Bundick aes-
thetic is appealing — he once 
told Rookie Magazine he likes 
White Vans, hiking, mid-cen-
tury Danish furniture, Weezer, 
The Blue Album by Weezer and 
rock documentaries, in that 
order. And while the beachy 
guitars and traditional fills on 
What For? fit the ’70s aesthet-
ic Bundick is aiming for, the 
album is missing the weirdness 
and awkwardness that made 
Toro y Moi so great in the past. 
Bundick may have been so con-
cerned with escaping his own 
boredom, that he actually ended 
up writing a boring album.

Grace Helbig moves 
to the small screen

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

From “What’s up, fuckers?” to 

“I don’t know,” Grace Helbig has 
become the queen of multi-media 
since her earli-
est 
YouTube 

days eight years 
ago. Now, she is 
the New York 
Times 
best-

selling writer of 
a self-help book 
for millennials, 
“Grace’s Guide: 
The Art of Pre-
tending to Be a 
Grown-up;” she 
has a top-rated 
audio-video 
podcast, “Not too Deep;” she is 
the one-woman production team 
for It’s Grace, her YouTube chan-
nel with over 2 million subscrib-
ers. She has experimented with 
new media, film, improvisational 
and stand-up comedy, screen-
writing – and now, television.

“The Internet’s awkward older 

sister” took her quirky sense of 
humor to the small screen, where 
she has her own talk show on the 
E! network, where she is now 
the only woman on late-night 
television since Chelsea Handler 
stepped down. Helbig describes 
it 
as 
a 
“curious 
introvert’s 

nighttime talk show #notsexual.” 
She has always predicted that 
the 
Internet 
and 
television 

will eventually enter a happy 
marriage, while still retaining 
their independent identities – 
and her show now merges the 
two in “a beautiful sandwich.” 
“The Grace Helbig Show” should 
be the epitome of everything 
Grace herself is – a preservation, 
yet magnification of her idiotic-
idiosyncratic personality.

The show is set in a Los Ange-

les home akin to Grace’s real resi-
dence where she shoots her web 
videos. Unlike all other late-night 
shows, her decision to not use a 
live audience reflects her Inter-
net-introversion, or as she puts 
it, “TGI-Fuck going out, we’re 
staying in where we’re safe from 

physical and emotional dangers.” 
Though her lack of a live audi-
ence may seem to create greater 
distance between herself and her 
viewers, she uses social media 
instead as a virtual connec-
tion to her audience. What new 
media (and especially vlogging) 
is all about is creating a realistic, 
though virtual, sense of reality 
and acquaintanceship, which she 
emulates in her new TV show. 
Grace chooses not to alienate 
herself as a “celebrity” with fans. 
Rather, her show emits a homey 
vibe more like a Friday night 
hang-out among best friends. 
With late-night shows like Seth 
Meyers or Jimmy Fallon, even at 
their live tapings, the audience 
feels more aloof than ever before.

Grace begins the show with a 

“Let’s Browse” segment where 
she covers the week’s pop culture 
news – attempting to talk sports 
and all things relatable in her 
typical frenetic fashion, where 
she does not try to hide her lack of 
true knowledge about the topics. 
Even when interviewing celebri-
ties, she strives to learn about the 
mundane quirks that draw them 
closer to us, instead of promoting 
their fame to isolate them even 
further from viewers.

Unlike other late-night talk 

shows that attempt to create seam-
lessness, trying to hide their tele-
prompters and crew members, 
“The Grace Helbig Show” is very 
conscious of itself. As Grace stated 
in an interview with USA Today, 
“There’s no trying to hide that 
there’s a crew involved. I (want) the 
fourth wall to be destroyed. I want 
the audience to feel like they’re on 
set; they know the director, they 
know the camera guy, they know 
the boom operator’s favorite type 
of deodorant.” On YouTube, Grace 
is a one-woman production team 
– directing, writing, starring and 
editing all of her own content with 
complete control. However, even 
though she now must work with 
a creative team, the show is still 
inherently so Grace. Grace typi-
cally improvises all of her content 
in her web videos – and though she 
may be following a slightly more 
structured script on her show, she 
still manages to seem like her free-
form, spontaneous self. In her You-
Tube videos, much of her humor 
comes from her editing style, and 
the show follows suit with erratic 
jump cuts and purposely hyper-
dramatic sound effects.

On YouTube, Grace is famous 

for her hilarious “collabs” with 
other YouTubers – and her show is 
merely an extension of the natural 
chemistry and brilliant comedic 
timing she exudes. As her first 
guest, she brought Aisha Tyler, 
who is nowhere near any type of 
A-list, but still a talented, highly-
respected 
actress-comedienne. 

Even though they spoke about 
Tyler’s podcast and work, their 
conversation was far more casual 
and personal, never falling into 
the sort of free advertisement most 
late-night shows often provide 
for guests. Grace later introduces 
another YouTube personality like 
herself, the German DJ, Flula, 
whom she enlists to create an 
eccentric theme song for her show. 
During his segment, they even 
leave the usual set to shoot in his 
car – a refreshing change of scen-
ery from the stagnant couch space 
usual talk shows stick to. It also is 
especially exciting to see a guest 
list of underrated celebrities in an 
amalgam with new media stars.

Unfortunately, though the show 

tries very hard to preserve Grace 

just the way she is, because she 
is on television for a much wider 
audience, she is not able to fully 
be her awkward, unrestrained, 
uncensored self by dropping an 
“eat shit” at any random moment. 
The semi-scripted nature of the 
show becomes more apparent 
when she interviews her real-life 
best friend and fellow YouTu-
ber, Mamrie Hart, host of “You 
Deserve a Drink.” There is a subtle, 
yet slightly uncomfortable sense 
of tension as they work through 
clearly rehearsed segments of 
prepared information to laugh on 
cue. Especially during their seg-
ment “Deal,” when they watch 
YouTube videos together as they 
normally would on a live Friday 
night YouTube livestream, it’s 
hard to believe or imagine them 
preparing themselves to laugh at 
content they have already seen and 
prepared. For the small screen, 
Grace is forced to become, in part, 
someone poised and trained for 
the camera – a persona that highly 
contradicts her usual discombobu-
lated personality.

On YouTube, we love Grace 

because she isn’t grace-ful; she 
wears the same groutfit for a week 
in a row without showering, yet 
she still produces hilarious content 
that makes us hurl in laughter. We 
feel comfortable curling up with 
her while we stay in on a Friday 
night in our pajamas because she 
is always on social media, tweet-
ing that she is doing the same. 
But now, because we have a look 
behind the scenes, we see that a 
three-woman team dolls her up 
in lavish garments and jewelry 
far more expensive than the items 
she vlogs about buying on sale at 
Forever 21. Her hair and make-
up are too perfect for the Grace 
we know to care about. If the 
purpose of the show is to stay in 
with her on a Friday night like 
she says, viewers wouldn’t feel 
as “at home” in her “house” as 
they would with the Grace they 
do know. Who looks that good at 
home with their best friends?

Finally, Grace signs off her first 

episode with a compilation video 
of clips her viewers have created 
– just another way she incorpo-
rates the audience so well. While 
Grace’s foremost aims are to 
maintain her own creative style 
over all else, she still wishes to 
work with her viewers, from 
their suggestions for set décor 
to guest lists and even content 
ideas. As she told Entertainment 
Weekly in an interview, “That’s 
kind of what social media is for 
— it’s a two-way conversation. I 
would be doing myself a disser-
vice if I didn’t continue that con-
versation with (the viewers).”

Television and new media 

are always looking to expand in 
unprecedented directions, and 
for the sake of being slightly more 
revolutionary, at least Grace is 
trying something new even if it’s 
not perfect. Just as Grace signs 
off all her YouTube videos with 
her tagline, “I don’t know,” she 
doesn’t know exactly what her 
show will become, but she aims 
to bring her audience along as lab 
assistants. Just as she has experi-
mented with a variety of media 
in her rise to recognition in Hol-
lywood, she has a beautiful free-
dom to just experiment with this 
cross-hybrid of mediums on her 
new show.

After all, her sole goal is 

just to “make something that 
doesn’t suck.” And for her high 
aspirations, that is exactly why 
we love Grace.

Wagner earns 
birthday win

Lefty settles down 
after first-inning 
home run, retires 

last 12

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Haylie 
Wagner’s 
birthday 

was just another reason to 
celebrate.

Michigan softball’s senior 

left-hander has had some very 
happy 
birthdays 
throughout 

her tenure with the Wolverines. 
With every passing year for 
Wagner, it seems that April 7 
has brought her more luck in 
the circle.

And her 22nd birthday was 

no different.

Tuesday, 

her 
birthday 

fortune 
was 

in full effect 
at 
Alumni 

Field, though 
it didn’t look 
that way from 
the start. After 
recording 
two outs in 
the top of the first, Eastern 
Michigan right fielder Michelle 
Kriegshauser 
stepped 
to 

the plate. On a 2-2 delivery, 
Kriegshauser crushed the ball 
over the left-field fence to put 
the Eagles up 1-0.

But that was the worst of 

Wagner’s play, as she went 
on to earn a nice present — an 
11-1 run-rule victory. Wagner 
pitched a perfect game after 
the solo shot off the bat of 
Kriegshauser. She mowed down 
12 straight Eagles and recorded 
six strikeouts in five innings.

“It’s the same thing every 

game that I’ve been focusing 
on,” 
Wagner 
said. 
“Just 

attacking 
the 
hitters 
and 

finishing my pitch. So after that 
(home run), I was just focusing 
on that and making the ball 
move. And it’s cool to get a win 
on your birthday. It’s fun.”

Though 
not 
quite 
as 

impressive 
as 
her 
Tuesday 

showing, 
Wagner’s 
other 

performances on April 7 stood 
out.

Wagner, just a freshman at 

the time, had a seven-inning 
battle against Ohio State in the 
circle in 2012, allowing just five 
hits, conceding four earned 

runs and leading Michigan to a 
6-5 victory.

And 365 days later, in 2013, 

the Wolverines’ ace picked up 
where she left off against the 
Buckeyes. Wagner produced a 
strong three-inning outing as 
Michigan cruised to a 17-5 run-
rule victory in which she didn’t 
allow a single earned run or 
walk.

Michigan didn’t get to play 

a game to mark Wagner’s 21st 
birthday in 2014, but she put 
together a shutout performance 
two days prior.

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins 
joked 
about 
the 

happenstance that Wagner has 
pitched on her birthday three 
times in her four-year career.

“It must be (a coincidence), 

because I’m not aware of that,” 

Hutchins said. 
“(And) 
last 

year 
didn’t 

fall 
on 
her 

birthday? 
Then I didn’t 
start her on 
her 
birthday 

(all 
four 

years).”

But 

Wagner’s 

career can’t be chalked up to a 
few special performances on 
her birthday. She boasts a 2.08 
earned-run average and a 15-2 
record in the 2015 campaign, 
and 
her 
performance 
has 

especially excelled as of late.

After faltering late in a 

loss to Iowa on March 29, the 
veteran quickly recovered for 
a crucial Big Ten series against 
Minnesota. 
In 
five 
innings 

against the Golden Gophers, 
Wagner 
allowed 
just 
one 

earned run and recorded five 
strikeouts, leading Michigan to 
a 9-4 victory.

“The 
main 
thing 
with 

her is her confidence,” said 
sophomore left fielder Kelly 
Christner. “When she has that 
self confidence, like, ‘Yeah I 
can dominate this game,’ and 
whenever she has that presence 
on the mound is when she really 
shuts the batters down.”

Tuesday was the last time 

Wagner will ever have the 
opportunity to step into the 
circle donning the maize and 
blue on her birthday. Yet for 
the next 30 games, she’ll still be 
wishing for the best gift of all — 
a Women’s College World Series 
ring.

Senior left-hander Haylie Wagner pitched five innings of one-hit ball Tuesday.

Wolverines rout EMU

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan and Eastern 

Michigan campuses are roughly 
11 miles apart from each other. 
But 
when 
the 
Wolverines 

played the 
Eagles 
on 

Tuesday, 
they 
proved that the two softball 
programs are many more miles 
apart in talent and performance.

With a day off on Monday, 

Michigan 
looked 
mentally 

prepared 
against 
its 
cross-

county opponent. It got the win 
by run-rule in five innings, 11-1.

“We usually have Mondays 

off so we can catch up on our 
studies and everything,” said 
sophomore left fielder Kelly 
Christner. “Then we can come 
out stronger like today. We have 
those Mondays to not worry 
about and kind of forget about 
softball and relax, and then we 
come back Tuesday refocused 
and ready to go.”

Added Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins: “It’s a long season, 
and it’s cumulative. … As a 
coach, you worry about how it 
will affect them and whether 
they’ll be focused when you 
have a game the next day.”

The worry may have settled 

in early as Eastern Michigan 
drew blood in the first inning. 
Senior pitcher Haylie Wagner 
went through the first two 
batters, earning a strikeout 
and a groundout. With Wagner 
needing one more strike to get 
out of the inning, sophomore 
Michelle Kriegshauser timed 
the 2-2 pitch perfectly, sending 
it over the left-field wall to give 
the Eagles a 1-0 lead.

But Wagner was perfect the 

rest of the way, not allowing a 
hit or walk through the next 
four 
innings. 
The 
offense 

backed her up, batting through 

the lineup in a single inning on 
two separate occasions.

The Wolverines evened the 

score 
almost 
immediately. 

Junior 
centerfielder 
Sierra 

Lawrence started the three-
run first inning with a walk 
and stolen base to get into 
scoring position. Junior second 
baseman Sierra Romero then 
drove Lawrence in with a 
base hit back up the middle, 
advancing to second on the 
throw home. Christner hit a 
ball right to the shortstop, but 
Romero was able to reach home 
on an errant throw. Christner 
scored off of another single 
by junior right fielder Kelsey 
Susalla.

Later in the inning, Michigan 

loaded the bases but couldn’t get 
a runner home. Nonetheless, the 
Wolverines had batted through 
the whole lineup, giving Wagner 
ample time to prepare mentally 
for the next inning. She used 
the time well, coming out in 
the second inning to earn three 

straight groundouts.

“They were ready to go and 

came out aggressive,” Hutchins 
said. “We love aggressive.”

The Wolverines started the 

second inning like they started 
the first, with Lawrence earning 
a walk and Romero hitting a 
single to knock the speedster 
in for a run. Two batters later, 
sophomore 
third 
baseman 

Lindsay Montemarano hit an 
RBI double to make the score 
5-1.

Sophomore shortstop Abby 

Ramirez stepped up to the dish 
in the third inning with one 
runner on. Given Ramirez’s 
status as a slap hitter, the Eagles 
outfield was playing in. Ramirez 
made them pay, hitting a shot 
past the centerfielder, batting a 
run in to push the lead to five. 
Two batters later, Christner 
hit a double to score two more. 
The next batter, Susalla, hit 
a liner past a diving Eastern 
Michigan right fielder, driving 
in yet another run. After an 

RBI sacrifice fly by freshman 
catcher Aidan Falk, Michigan 
had a commanding 10-1 lead to 
end the third.

Montemarano 
walked 

with the bases loaded in the 
fourth inning, scoring another 
run. But that was it for the 
Wolverines, as Wagner struck 
out to close the inning. With 
a 10-run lead, Wagner had the 
opportunity to redeem herself 
after her strikeout by pitching 
a shutdown inning to end the 
game on the run rule.

She did just that, picking 

up two more strikeouts to put 
her count at six on the day. 
With Wagner’s stellar pitching 
and Michigan’s potent offense 
scoring at will, it was a near-
perfect day for the team.

And with the Wolverines’ 

dominant performance, they 
continue 
to 
have 
bragging 

rights in Washtenaw County. 
The schools are close, but with 
regard to their softball teams, 
there’s a much bigger gap.

Hill, Maezes continue road back

Benedetti keeps 
hot streak going in 
blowout win over 
Eastern Michigan

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

was already rounding into form 
in the last two 
weeks. 
Now 

it 
has 
two 

key contributors returning to 
provide a boost.

Following a series win at 

defending Big Ten champion 
Indiana last weekend, Michigan 
returned home and steamrolled 
Eastern Michigan on Tuesday, 
18-4, notching 20 hits in the 
process.

“It was great to see some 

offensive explosion and some 
fireworks out there today,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“They did a good job of taking 
advantage of pitches that they 
could drive for extra base hits. 
We didn’t hit 20 singles.”

The contest featured two key 

contributors for the Wolverines 
who have been suffering from 
injuries: 
junior 
left-handed 

pitcher Evan Hill and junior 
infielder Travis Maezes.

Hill 
— 
who 
has 
been 

rehabilitating 
from 
a 
knee 

injury — made his first start of 
the season Tuesday. He pitched 
two innings and surrendered 
only one run on two hits while 
striking out two batters. Hill’s 
return adds even more depth 
to an already-stacked pitching 
staff.

“I definitely thought I had 

more in me, but the two-inning 
start was scheduled,” Hill said. 
“Whatever (the coaching staff) 
wants me to do going forward, 
I’ll be there ready to go.”

Maezes, 
who 
has 
been 

suffering 
from 
a 
strained 

oblique, was moved from his 
usual 
shortstop position 
to 

third base in order to allow 
him 
playing 
time 
without 

exacerbating the injury.

And it has paid off. Since 

returning to the lineup April 
1 against Central Michigan, 
Maezes is batting 10-for-21 
with six runs scored and three 
doubles. Against the Eagles, he 
went 1-for-4 with a run scored.

BIG 
EARLY 
INNINGS 

PROPEL 
MICHIGAN: 
In 

Tuesday’s game, the Wolverines 
scored three runs each in the 
first and second innings.

Michigan’s 
offense 
has 

made a habit of storming out 
of the gate, such as in the first 
innings 
of 

games against 
Maryland 
on 

March 29 and 
Toledo 
on 

March 31. The 
Wolverines 
put up five in 
the first frame 
against 
the 

Terrapins and 
four 
against 

the Rockets.

With 

runners on first and second 
and none out in the first 
frame, Maezes hit a single and 
advanced to second on an error 
that also allowed a run to score. 
Two batters later, junior left 

fielder Cody Bruder smacked a 
double to left field that drove in 
two more runs.

“Our guys are focused on 

helping the team score the most 
runs,” Bakich said. “A lot of it is 
just that we’ve got good hitters.”

In the second, with Michigan 

ahead, 3-1, sophomore right 
fielder Johnny Slater added 
another run to the Wolverines’ 
total by rounding the bases in a 
highly unusual fashion. He drew 
a walk, advanced to second on a 

failed pickoff 
attempt, 
reached third 
on a balk and 
scored 
on 
a 

wild pitch.

“(Slater) 

manufactured 
the 
run 
all 

by 
himself,” 

Bakich 
said. 

“We’ll 
take 

it. It was a 
big run at the 

time.”

Later 
in 
the 
inning, 

sophomore 
first 
baseman 

Carmen Benedetti and Bruder 
contributed to the Wolverines’ 
cause in a more conventional 

matter. Both belted RBI base 
hits — Benedetti a double and 
Bruder a triple — to extend 
Michigan’s lead to 6-1.

“A lot of guys had quality 

at-bats,” Bakich said. “We made 
a lot of hard contact all over the 
field.”

BENEDETTI CONTINUES 

HOT STRETCH: It has been 
a banner year for Benedetti, 
who leads the Big Ten with 35 
RBI. In addition, he posts a .353 
batting average with 41 hits, 
three home runs and a team-
best 12 doubles.

But he really made waves in 

last weekend’s series against 
the Hoosiers by going 7-for-
13 with a slugging percentage 
of 1.077. Benedetti carried his 
momentum 
into 
Tuesday’s 

game, nabbing three hits in four 
at-bats and scoring a run in the 
process.

Benedetti is hardly alone in 

his offensive success, though. 
The Wolverines topped the Big 
Ten in batting average (.294) 
following the weekend series 
against Indiana.

“We’ve got a lot of confidence 

right now,” Benedetti said. “It’s 
an awesome feeling.”

“It’s cool to get 
a win on your 
birthday. It’s 

fun.”

Wolverines pound 
Eastern Michigan

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

Coming 
into 
Tuesday’s 

matchup at Ray Fisher Stadium, 
the Michigan baseball team 
had lost its 
last 
seven 

games 
against 
nearby foe Eastern Michigan. 
After slugging 13 extra-base hits 
and accumulating a season-high 
42 total bases, the Wolverines 
broke that losing streak with an 
18-4 victory.

“What 
stood 
out 
to 
me 

today was that we didn’t hit 20 
singles,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “We had a lot of 
extra-base hits, and our guys 
were really making hard contact 
even on some of our outs. It was 
great to see us not settle and 
keep the score at 8-4, but be able 
to put 11 runs up in the last three 
innings.”

Though it was the end of the 

game that contained the biggest 
fireworks, the Wolverines (4-5 
Big Ten, 19-13 overall) jumped 
out to a quick start in the bottom 
of the first inning when they 
muscled three runs across the 
plate.

The first two hitters in the 

lineup reached base and moved 
around on a run-scoring single 
from 
junior 
third 
baseman 

Travis Maezes. That left two 
men on base with two outs for 
junior left fielder Cody Bruder, 
who would smack his first of 
four extra-base hits on the 
evening.

“It was really important to get 

out to a good start tonight,” said 
Michigan first baseman Carmen 
Benedetti. “Eastern has kind 
of had their way with us, and it 
was good to start off hot against 

them, throw some punches and 
knock them down.”

The 
Eagles 
(4-5, 
12-19) 

knocked in one run against 
junior left-handed pitcher Evan 
Hill, but Michigan responded 
in the bottom of the frame 
with three more scores. Seven 
Wolverines went to the plate, 
highlighted 
by 
back-to-back, 

line-drive hits by Benedetti 
and Bruder, falling for a double 
and triple, respectively, to put 
Michigan up 6-1 heading to the 
third.

Earlier 
in 

the 
week, 

Bakich 
said 

that Hill, who 
was 
making 

his 
first 

start 
of 
the 

season 
after 

rehabbing 
a 

knee 
injury 

sustained 
in 

the fall, was 
expected to throw just a few 
innings in order to rebuild his 
arm strength.

Hill gave two innings of work, 

allowing just two hits and one 
earned run while striking out a 
pair of hitters.

Freshman 
right-hander 

Jayce Vancena came in for 
the Wolverines after Hill had 
completed his scheduled two 
innings of work, putting together 
four solid innings on the mound. 
Vancena allowed three runs to 
score, but there was little doubt 
concerning the outcome of the 
game. After Vancena entered 
from the bullpen, the closest 
the game became was 8-4 after 
Eastern Michigan tacked on 
two runs in the top of the fourth 
inning.

From that point on, Michigan 

would slug three home runs, two 

triples and five doubles en route 
to its final tally of 18 runs.

Two Wolverines stood out in 

the run-producing department. 
Bruder and sophomore right 
fielder Johnny Slater combined 
for 11 RBI on the night and 
accounted for much of the high 
level of the game’s slugging 
statistics.

Two of Michigan’s three 

home runs came from Slater, 
who launched balls over the 
right-field wall in both the 
sixth and seventh innings, and 

Bruder ended 
up being only 
a 
home 
run 

shy of hitting 
for the cycle. 
No Wolverine 
has hit for the 
cycle 
since 

2007, 
and 

Slater was the 
first Michigan 
player to hit 

two home runs in a game since 
Jacob 
Cronenworth 
did 
so 

against Illinois on April 12, 2014.

“Something 
we’ve 
talked 

about has been that we can 
put up a crooked number and 
then maybe not score for a 
few innings or just hold the 
lead after a three- or five-run 
inning,” Bakich said. “So for us 
to have five different innings 
where we score multiple runs 
was good to see our team do. It 
was great to see some offensive 
explosion and fireworks out 
here.”

Michigan has won seven 

of its last eight games and is 
sailing toward easier parts of its 
conference schedule. If it hopes 
to get into the national rankings 
again, the team will have to keep 
dominating even the midweek 
games.
