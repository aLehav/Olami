CAMPUS CRIME
Mass e-mails
condemn
Haven Hall
vandalism

Provost, LSA dean
express concern
over the incident
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily Staff Reporter
Administrators sent state-
ments to the University com-
munity on Thursday deploring
alleged vandalism that occurred
earlier this week in Haven Hall.
University Provost Philip
Hanlon and LSA Dean Terrence
McDonald sent mass e-mails on
Thursday expressing concern
over the incident, which is still
under investigation.
Late Monday night or early
Tuesday morning, informa-
tional posters - includingthose
supporting LGBT rights, black
rights, feminism and multi-
cultural programming - were
reportedly torn from bulletin
boards in several departments
in Haven Hall.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown
said a number of postings on
four floors of Haven Hall were
dismantled, but not all of them
were discriminatorily biased.

The incident is being investi-
gated by DPS as a malicious
destruction of property, Brown
said, but the department does
not believe the alleged crime
was a discriminatory incident.
Still, some graduate students
and professors have argued
that the incident constitutes a
biased act, claiming that van-
dals seemed to primarily target
academic departments focused
on multicultural education.
About 30 graduate students
posted fliers in Mason and
Angell Halls that supported
free speech and tolerance in
response on Wednesday night.
Hanlon's e-mail - which
was sent at about 4:20 p.m. on
Thursday - condemned van-
dalism and intolerance but
refrained from directly refer-
ring to the vandalism as a bias
incident.
"This act of destruction and
intolerance is not Michigan,"
Hanlon wrote in the e-mail.
"Michigan is the sharing of
diverse viewpoints and ideas in
a safe environment grounded in
mutual respect."
Hanlon concluded his e-mail
by urging students to remember

ELECTION 2012
College

in dorms
 Group registered
about 5,000
voters this year
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Students in many of the
University's residence halls
woke to the sound of knock-
ing on their doors a few Sat-
urdays ago. As they stumbled
out of bed to investigate
the commotion, they were
greeted by members of the
University's chapter of Col-
lege Democrats, urging them
to register to vote before the
Oct. 9 deadline.
The group referred to its
effort as the "dorm storm,"
a centerpiece of its project
to register voters and ener-
gize Democrats in the resi-
dence halls. This year is the
first presidential election
in which groups other than
the non-partisan Central
Student Government com-
mission, Voice Your Vote,
may canvass in the residence
halls.

2010, two new restaurants are

slated to fill the vacancies on
East William Street this sum-

Firehouse Subs, a family-

than 525 restaurants in 32 U.S.

John Kupiec - the Michigan
representative for Firehouse
Subs, which will feature subs,
salads and sides such as chili -
said the chain's goal is to open
2,000 locations by 2020, with
59 in Michigan alone.
"We're looking to expand

A white Bay City man has been
charged with committing a hate
crime, accused of the racially
motivated beating of a black man.
Twenty-four-year-old Justin
Bouza was due in court Thursday
for a preliminary examination to
decide if he should stand trial on
chargesofethnic intimidation and
aggravated assault. The intimida-
tioncharge carries upto two years
in prison.
Mlive.com reports that author-
ities say Bouza and a 21-year-old
man attacked 26-year-old Jeremy
Love about 2:45 a.m. onAug. 12.
Police say they found Love
lying on the ground, bleeding and
groggy. He was treated for a con-

Witnesses say Bouza and his
companion used racial slurs while
punching and kicking Love on the
ground.
LOS ANGELES
Filmmaker behind
anti-Muslim movie
denies allegations
The California man behind the
anti-Muslim film that sparked
violence in the Middle East
denied Wednesday that he vio-
lated terms of his probation for
a 2010 bank fraud conviction by
using aliases and lying about his
role in the movie.
Mark Basseley Youssef, 55,
made a brief appearance in a
courtroom packed with media
and quietly repeated "deny" when
all eight probation violation alle-
gations were read by U.S. District
Judge Christina Snyder, who
scheduled an evidentiary hearing
for Nov. 9.
None of the alleged violations
have to do with the content of the
movie or whether Youssef was
the one who posted to YouTube
the 14-minute trailer for "Inno-
cence of Muslims," which depicts
Mohammad as a religious fraud,
womanizer and pedophile. Fed-
eral authorities are seeking two
years in prison for Youssef, who
remains in custody and held with-
out bail.
ANKARA, Turkey
Turkey intercepts
arms bound for
Syria from Russia
Escalating tensions with Rus-
sia, Turkey defended its forced
landing of a Syrian passenger jet
en route from Moscow to Damas-
cus, saying Thursday it was car-
rying Russian ammunition and
military equipment destined for
the Syrian Defense Ministry.
Syria branded the incident pira-
cy and Russia called the search
illegal, saying it endangered the
lives of Russian citizens aboard
the plane.
The accusation by Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan contradicted denials by

both Russia and Syria that any-
thing illegal had been aboard
the Airbus A320 that was inter-
cepted over Turkish airspace late
Wednesday.
ATHENS
Greek jobless rate
reaches 25 percent
Unemployment in Greece hit a
record high of 25.1 percent inJuly
as the country's financial crisis
continues to exact its heavy toll,
official figures showed Thursday.
All indications are that unem-
ployment in Greece will continue
to rise. The economy has shrunk
by around a fifth since the reces-
sion started in 2008 and youth
unemployment has pushed far
above 50 percent. The economy is
expected to enter a sixth year of
recession next year.
"This is a very dramatic result
of the recession," said Angelos
Tsakanikas, head of research at
Greece's IOBE economic research
foundation.
The state statistics agency said
Greece's unemployment rate rose
from 24.8 percent in June.

Daily wire reports

CANVASS
From Page 1
In previous election years,
canvassers for Voice Your Vote
could register voters only dur-
ing designated hours and were
not permitted to display any
signs of partisanship. How-
ever, in 2008, members of the
College Democrats and law-
yers from President Barack
Obama's campaign met with
University Housing and the
University's Office of Gen-
eral Counsel. The night before
the registration deadline that
year, the University cleared the
group to register voters in the
residence halls.
Since 2010, when the Uni-
versity's Residence Halls Asso-
ciation created a committee to
examine the issue, the policy
stands that students may can-
vass only in the residence halls
they live in, according to Uni-
versity Housing spokesman
Peter Logan.
Though the College Demo-
crats, the University's chapter
of College Republicans and the
American Civil Liberties Union
challenged the policy at the
time, arguing that it was too
limiting, the code has remained
in place even after housing offi-
cials re-evaluated it this sum-

mer.
The reason, according to
Logan, is that the policy offers
the "most workable approach"
to balancing concerns about
the privacy of students with
the efforts of political groups
to reach the broadest constitu-
ency of students.
"Because of literallythe huge
number of student organiza-
tions on campus, it can become
very intrusive in a student's
privacy when non-residents
are coming into the building,"
Logan said. "It's not to say that
other organizations don't have
good points of view; it's just
that there are so many."
Registration of on-campus
residents was a priority for the
College Democrats, accord-
ing to LSA sophomores Mary
Bridget Lee and Jacob Light,
co-chairs of the ResHall Dems
committee.
In an interview Thursday
after the registration deadline
passed, Lee and Light said get-
ting underclassmen who are
likely first-time voters regis-
tered and prepared to vote was
a critical issue for them.
"The residence halls are a
huge resource for us in the
upcoming election," Lee said.
"A lot of times you forget that so
much of the student body lives
in the residence halls. It's silly

not to have those resources."
To engage voters in the resi-
dence halls, Lee and Light said
the committee organized can-
vasses throughout the semester.
They also equipped committee
members who are living in the
dorms with voter registration
forms and literature about how
and where to vote.
"More than anything, the
ResHall Dems really prepared
dorm residents to be the go-to
person for questions about vot-
ing and questions about the
election," Light said.
Light and Lee said they
obeyed the resident-only policy
during the "dorm storm" event
and in their other efforts in
the residence halls. In the two
months between the start of
the semester and the registra-
tion deadline, Light said the
group registered about 150 to
200 students in the residence
halls.
Though that figure repre-
sents only a small percentage
of the group's total - approxi-
mately 450 voters on Tuesday
alone and about 5,000 this
election cycle - Light said the
efforts in the residence halls
were crucial for the group.
"Politics is not just candi-
dates - it's going door-to-door,
phone-banking, writing, social
media," he said.

VANDALISM
From Page 1
the University's values of multi-
culturalism and mutual accep-
tance.
"I encourage all members of
the University community to
take this opportunity to reaffirm
our deepest ethical commitment
to diversity and respect, values
that make Michigan a recog-
nized leader in higher education
and beyond," Hanlon wrote.
McDonald sent an e-mail
addressed to the "Haven Hall
Community" that released fur-
ther details about the vandalism
and expressed sorrow for the
incident while assuring those
who received the e-mail that the
building was safe.
"Like you, I was appalled and
upset by the news I received
Wednesdaymorningofextensive
vandalism to bulletin boards and
faculty doors throughout Haven
Hall," McDonald wrote. "This
conduct was deplorable, coward-
ly, and anti-intellectual."
McDonald wrote that the
doors of 11 faculty members were
affected by the incident in addi-
tion to the boards in hallways.
McDonald's e-mail confirmed

that additional DPS patrols
would be initiated in the area.
McDonald reaffirmed DPS
reports that only some of the
removed postings related to race,
gender or sexuality, but added
that messages concerning class
and capitalism were also taken
down.
McDonald also wrote that
LSA condemns the event and
encourages its professors to con-
tinue their multicultural studies
in defiance of the alleged intoler-
ance.
"The entire college joins me
in deploring this attack on our
free speech and our commit-
ment to studying the topics that
the vandal(s) seemed to want to
remove from view," McDonald
wrote.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the administra-
tors' e-mails are in accordance
with the University's established
values of diversity and accep-
tance.
"I think both Dean McDon-
ald and Provost Hanlon make
strong statements about what we
believe as a University and what
they believe about what values
the University and the University
community hold in the highest
regard," Fitzgerald said.

munity with plenty of things to
offer for a franchise restaurant
brand like ourselves."
Mark Cairns, the director of
franchise development for Top-
pers Pizza, said about half of
the company's stores are locat-
ed around college campuses
and entertainment areas.
"We're a Midwest franchise;
our brand caters towards the
18-to-34 (year old) feel," Cairns
said.
Cairns said he is not con-
cerned by the number of pizza
businesses already in Ann
Arbor because he believes
Toppers uses better qual-
itv ingredients than the tvical

chain-style pizza restaurant,
such as Domino's or Little Cae-
sar's.
"We grind block Wisconsin
cheese fresh in the stores every
day," he said. "We just have a
great product."
NeoPapalis Pizza, which
opened Wednesday, is also
located on East William Street
in the new Zaragon West devel-
opment. New York Pizza Depot
and Jimmy John's sandwich
shops are also located on the
street.
NYPD manager Alex Kassem
said he isn't worried about Top-
pers Pizza opening next door
because NYPD has become an
Ann Arbor staple.
"They do have very differ-
ent pizza," Kassem said. "We
are sure we have a better prod-

uct. Ask anybody in Ann Arbor
- they will tell you this is the
best."
Psychology Ph.D. student
Alanna Epstein - whose office
is located near the future loca-
tion of the two restaurants -
said she personally does not
plan to visit either restaurant,
but believes other students
would.
"If another sub shop and
another pizza place opened
right there it would seem a little
bit redundant to me," Epstein
said. "I personally would prefer
to have a healthier restaurant."
Scott Goci, an Ann Arbor
resident and a University alum,
said he may have lunch at a new
sub shop, but believes there are
already too many pizza places
in Ann Arbor.

Public crossing
Town should take down religous symbol in park
The United States has long held separation of church and
state as a fundamental principle. In order to prevent religion
from holding too much sway over the functions of govern-
ment that affect people of all faiths, the two are kept apart. Prob-
lems arise when strict secularism infringes on the religious rights of
a few. In Frankenmuth, Mich., a privately funded cross was recently
erected in a public park. Americans United for Separation of Church
and State filed a complaint in July and may file a lawsuit since the
city has not removed the 55-foot tall structure.

Riding dirty

As fall descends and Mother
Nature exerts an even great-
er effort to make Michigan
commuters mis-
erable, some of us
will stop cycling
to class. For oth-
ers, though, rid-
ing is the best
option even in
fall showers
and light snows. MICHAEL
Those bikers will SMALLEGAN
face a difficult
choice between
what's good for
them and what's good for their bike.
This shouldn't be the case.
The University is a leader in
numerous areas, but it lags behind
in the area of sustainable bike infra-
structure. Last year, the League
of American Bicyclists awarded a
bronze-level Bike Friendly Univer-
sity designation to Michigan State
University. Almost a year behind
them, the University received that
same designation. Bronze is by no
means the top though, and admin-
istrators clearly see this as a growth
area. In January, high-ranking cam-
pus officials held a forum to discuss
bike transportation on campus, and
it wasn't an idle talk. This fall, the
announcement of the Blue Bikes
rental program through Outdoor
Adventures signaled that supporting
sustainable transportation is an area
of focus and action.
There are many directions the
improvement of campus bike infra-
structure could take, including the
expansionofbikelanes andbike path-
ways, implementing a bike-sharing
program, increasing the availability
of bike education and constructing
enclosed, secured bike parking. All

of these are fantastic solutions, and
all may need tobe explored if we aim
to match Stanford University's level
of bike friendliness, the only school
with a BFU platinum ranking. How-
ever, the most pressing and immedi-
ately helpful measure costs a lot less:
providingsheltered bike parking.
In Michigan, we all know that if
one minute it's cloudy and raining,
in the next five it could be pleasantly
sunny. The opposite is also true, and
without covered bike parking, con-
scientious bike owners's days are
disrupted facing these concerns.
Physics Prof. Gus Evrard, a com-
mitted bike commuter, has often
had to leave meetings to retrieve
his bike from sudden inclement
weather. Unlike cars, bikes have
all of their most important compo-
nents exposed to the elements, and,
if left uncovered, can deteriorate
very quickly.
The bicycle graveyard that we
witness every spring is an unfortu-
nate side effect of winter exposure.
Biking is considered sustainable, and
yet snowmelt uncovers rusty frames,
missing wheels and broken spokes all
over campus. Not only is this a waste,
but the Department of Public Safety
has to incur the cost of impounding
and disposing of the bikes. Certainly,
increasing educational programs
that teach the basics of bike mainte-
nance can help minimize this, but if
bikes are covered, this simple protec-
tion may keep them usable enough to
discourage student abandonment.
Covered parking does exist on
campus, notably on the east side
of North Quad Residence Hall and
underneath the backside of Hatcher
Gradate Library. It's clear from the
crowding of the North Quad bike
racks that the introduction of the

shelter was not only valuable, but
also popular. However, additional
bike shelters don't need to be as
costly as the one installed at North
Quad. A lightweight model made
from sustainable materials could
easily be adapted to enhance the
University's current bike parking
layout. Evrard, who has given the
issue considerable thought, envi-
sions a bike shelter project that
unites campus under a shared goal.
'U' should
install sheltered
bike parking.
"We have all the resources right
here for the whole process," said
Evrard, elaborating on his vision of a
design competitionto choose the best
innovation to install across campus.
Parking and Transportation Ser-
vices released a70-page reportonthe
future of University bike infrastruc-
ture in 2009. Three years later, very
littleofthat"BikeBlueprint"hasbeen
implemented. Fostering bike trans-
portation is a priority for the Univer-
sity, and it's important that planners
know the direction that the com-
munity needs most. In this case, it's
easy to have your voice heard - the
University is listening. Make a bike
parking request on the PTS website.
It's time for action before our bikes
suffer another Michigan winter.

place. In France, laicite controversially pre-
vents Muslim women from wearing the hijab,
or burka, in government-sponsored public
schools. Alex Luchenitser, associate legal direc-
tor at Americans United, stated that the cross
"sends a message that the city holds Christian-
ity above all other religions and a message that
non-Christians are not welcome."
According to the U.S. Court of Appeals
decision ACLU v. Mercer County in 2005,
religious displays on public property are
allowed when the display's purpose is secu-
lar. The city of Frankenmuth has stated that
its cross celebrates the 200th birthday of the
U.S. in 1976 and the history and culture of the
city itself.

The three-pronged Lemon test established
in Lemon v. Kurtzman in 1971 establishes that.
any government legislation "must have a secu-
lar legislative purpose; must not have the pri-
mary effect of either advancing or inhibiting
religion," and "must not result in an 'exces-
sive government entanglement' with religion."
A violation of any one of these results in the
unconstitutionality of the law.
The cross was assembled by a private organi-
zation, not the city of Frankenmuth. However,
since the property is public rather than private
- and though the park is named "Cross" - it
should be removed. Americans have the right to
express their religion, but not in such a fashion.
The cross is a permanent fixture and should be
taken down, if not for the logical reason of its
potential to offend the populace or even Fran-
kenmuth tourists, then for the principle behind
the separation of church and state.

A cure for health care

Health care reform status: Dire. Prognosis:
Pending November results. As a physician, Iam
highly concerned. Health care reformhas come
too far for its progress to be erased. No one
gets to choose when he or she gets sick. Illness
afflicts everyone at some point in their lives,
often without warning. Before the passage
of the Affordable Care Act, the status quo of
health care was one of great uncertainty. Like
pulling out a trusty umbrella to shield yourself
from a sudden downpour only to find it broken,
many patients found their insurance did not
cover them when they needed it most.
Since being passed, the ACA has made great
strides toward the goal of affordable, effective
and fair health care. The ACA is already having
a huge impact in Michigan. As of April, 1,263
previously uninsured Michigan residents are
covered underthe ACA's new Pre-Existing Con-
dition Insurance Plan. These residents need not
worry about a change in employment or loss of
job leavingthem withouthealth insurance.
For those currently healthy, prevention is
the best medicine. Nationwide, the ACA cov-
ers preventive services for 54-million privately
insured Americans, including almost 2 million
in Michigan. The famed Medicare donut hole
will be closed by 2020, but Michigan seniors
have already saved more than $90 million on
the cost of prescription drugs. Young adults
under the age of 26 are eligible to stay on their
family insurance plan, which has helped pro-
vide coverage to 3.1-million people nationwide
and more than 94,000 people in Michigan as of

December 2011.
Soon patients will be able to choose their
insurance policies in state-run affordable
insurance exchanges. Insurance plans will be
presented in a standardized format that allows
people to compare them head to head. This rep-
resents a true step forward for patient freedom
of choice.
As for employers, a new study by the Urban
Institute found that "the ACA benefits, rather
than burdens small employers who wantto pro-
vide health insurance, leaves the overall costs
of employer-sponsored health insurance large-
ly unchanged, and offers the potential, through
cost containment, of slowing the growth in
health care costs, benefiting private along with
public purchasers of health insurance."
Thus, the ACA is already helping patients
get much-needed care and health coverage,
reigning in the abuses of the most egregious
health insurance policy practices and actively
addressing the cost of health care in general.
As a physician, I support the ACA and I'm not
alone. Nearly all major medical associations
and patient advocacy groups support the ACA
as well. It's not political, it's essential - for
the health, well-being and care of all Ameri-
can citizens.
If you're sick of politics getting in the way of
patient care, I have a prescription for you: take
two friends to the voting booth and call me in
the morning.

I thought I could ignore it. But
it's hard to when it's screamed at
me from six television screens at the
CCRB. It's hard to avoid something
that fills my inbox, demanding inter-
view requests and providingunsolic-
ited advice and commentary. And it's
almost impossible to ignore when it's
subversively brought up in class by
the student sitting across from me -
"I mean just look at what's happen-
ing in the Muslim world!"
What's happening in the Muslim
world? What is the Muslim world?
What do Muslims have to say about
this madness? It's not that I want-
ed to ignore these questions, but
at some point, the painful images
symbolizing what critics from all
political spectrums have claimed as
the epitome of the clash of civiliza-
tions have affected my social real-
ity. All around me there have been
conversations normalizing racism
and vilifying Muslims.
There's a lot to say. I could spend
hours talking about the complex his-
tory and consequences of coloniza-
tion in Muslim-majority countries.
I could talk about the perception of
U.S. hegemony in other countries as
a resultof years of systematic imperi-
alistic foreign policies. I could spend
a long time writing about who my
compassionate Prophet Muhammad
was, or how my faith encourages me
to "repel (evil) with what is better"
(Qur'an 41:34). I could write pages
about the dangers of demonizing
the Other - but this isn't meant to
be a classroom lecture. Rather, I will
share my personal narrative, focus-
ing on how these global events affect
my daily life as a University of Michi-
gan student.
Since the start of the school year,
our lively board - made up of vary-
ing committee heads - has been
working tirelessly with dedicated
community members to organize
a diverse range of activities, events
and discussions. We hope this pro-
gramming will improve and enhance
the life of students on campus - for
Muslim students and the greater
campus community alike.
Like many students at the Uni-
versity, balancing school and work
while leading a large and active
campus organization takes a toll
on my inbox (thank God for Gmail
filters). It's constantly replenished
with e-mails regarding event logis-
tics, outreach with other student
organizations and random requests
on MSA listservs for textbooks,
sewing kits and anything else you
can imagine. Recently, the e-mails
have continued, but with a new ring
to them:
"Are you guys going to post a
condemnation of the terrorist kill-
ing of a U.S. Ambassador? Might be

a good idea."
"Dear sir, You can see why Islam
is a false religion and Mohammed is
a false prophet by looking at what is
going on in the Middle East. Muslims
have raped, tortured, and killed our
U.S. ambassador."
"I'm doing a story localizing the
controversial anti-Islam film "Inno-
cence of Muslims" to Michigan,
speaking to representatives of the
Islamic community here. YouTube
is refusing to remove the video from
their website, and I hope to talk to
someone who can offer an opinion
on the behalf of your organization
on this issue."
"Hi there. I am writing to ask for
a brief over-the-phone interview
from you. This is in light of the
YouTube video and the events that
have taken place in the Middle East
as a result. I simply wish to ask your
opinions regarding the video, the
reaction to it and any future course
of action you guys would like to see
taken."
Aside from the e-mails, I've
been approached by a number of
people who've asked me to provide
them with MSA's official state-
ment regarding the recent protests
around the world.
I'd like to hope that most of these
requests are well-intentioned, or
an attempt to put a local spin on
an international story. I appreciate
those individuals who want to pro-
vide Muslim students at Michigan
the opportunity to share their opin-
ions on this issue. But the fact that
some media outlets and individuals
reach out to us only in times of neg-
ative and unfortunate events makes
me skeptical of their motives. The
idea that the very diverse Universi-
ty Muslim community is expected
to have a single "reaction" and be
seeking a unified "course of action"
is precisely the image of reaction-
ary, threatening Muslims on which
the media thrives. It's understand-
able that some will want to hurry to
condemn these senseless acts and
defend our faith from prevalent
prejudiced rhetoric, but it's impor-
tant to remember that this reac-
tionist narrative is being pushed by
racist, alarmist media that can't be
trusted to report honestly on Mus-
lim Americans' experiences and
opinions. There's very little evi-
dence that this "film controversy"
or these protests hold a priority in
Muslims's daily lives.
I'm tired of defending ignorant
and reactionary people who do
not represent me. I am also tired
of being told to publicly condemn
extremism or become apologetic
for people I've never met.
For when I do, my voice seems
to not be loud enough - my voice

becomes ventriloquized and the
spotlight stubbornly remains on
fringe extremists anyway. Pushing
us to consume our time and efforts
with these issues is not only burden-
some, it also poses a serious social
justice issue for our community.
When we are expected to spend
our time focusing on responding to
international events or reacting to
incidents instead of being proactive
and engaged activists within our
communities, this causes a margin-
alized community to stay within
the margins. Instead of focusing on
the many incredible initiatives and
proactive projects that our commu-
nity puts together - things like the
Civic Engagement Forum or Fast-a-
thon or the Islam & Hip Hop Panel
- we are pushed instead to narrow
our focus on a defined set of issues
and to let that consume our time
and minds, limiting the scope and
strength of our community.
I refuse to play by these pre-
conditioned terms. I refuse to let
anyone dictate the agenda for how
our relationship with the greater
community ought to be or how
we should focus our energy on
explaining ourselves instead of
working on initiatives to create a
more inclusive Muslim and cam-
pus community. I refuse to follow
the script and act out the scenario
that certain individuals want to
see played out - these individuals
benefit from perpetuating this nar-
rative of a looming clash of civiliza-
tions and these individuals believe
that as a Muslim, my voice is only
valuable when condemning or
reacting to a distant event. To ask
me, an American citizen, howI feel
about the killing of an American
ambassador is a scathing insult. To
ask me why Muslims are so angry
and savage presumes that you've
already made up your mind and are
simply looking for a few words to
affirm your preconceived notions. I
am all for dialogue and effectively
engaging different communities,
but not when dialogical efforts fur-
ther pigeonhole oppressed groups.
Until we come to see everybody
as multidimensional individuals
with complex identities, stories
and histories; until we reach a point
where we are able to appreciate the
nuanced and diverse narratives
we carry; until we reject absurd
attempts to tokenize, homogenize
and essentialize one another using
ridiculous phrases like, "What is
your reaction as a Muslim?" and
"Muslim Rage" and false binaries
like "Why do they hate us?" - until
then, we cannot learn to shift para-
digms and reclaim our voices.

Princes and equality will
win a woman's heart.
TO THE DAILY:
In his response to Bethany Biron's article
about trends in women sexual culture, Jef-
frey McMahon completely reframes and mis-
represents the issue as black and white. He
looks down at those living a promiscuous life-
style, calling it immature, underclassman-like
behavior and he says that the guys on campus
need to man up and treat women like the prin-.
cesses that they are.
But in denouncing the sexual objecti-
fication of women, McMahon becomes

a proponent of a whole different kind of
objectification: viewing women as spineless
creatures dependent on men. His outlook is
entirely based on the assumption that women
are incapable of being socially and sexually
independent and that they need a man to
make them feel good about themselves.
Undoubtedly, some women would like to be
treated as princesses, but I think just as many,
if not more, would rather be treated as equals.
A real man can care about a woman and "cher-
ish her heart" by treating her with respect, not
putting her on a pedestal.

public television.
"The disease was discussed in
whispers, but it's very difficult
for students today to compre-
hendthat with a24/7 news cycle,
social media and the ability to
share opinions instantly across
the world with a mobile device,"
Brinkler said.
Despite the challenges, Ford
prevailed, and today Susan G.
Komen for the Cure is the largest
advocacy organization for can-
cer awareness in the world. Brin-
kler noted that the organization
began in 1982 with 800 members
and now has grown to include
more than 2 million people.
"Most people thought that we
would have a fundraiser or two
and then just go back to being
housewives," Brinker said.
In her address at the event,
President Coleman lauded Ford
for exemplary actions as first
lady.
"Betty Ford was a role model
- and not just for women," Cole-
man said. "She raised our con-
sciousness and helped expand
public perceptions of the roles
of women to include family and
professional careers. She showed
all of us the value and impor-
tance of integrity, honesty and
dignity."
Coleman said she was able
to interact with both Ford and
President Ford in the time she's
been at the University.
"I first admired Betty Ford
from afar," Coleman said. "After
coming to the University, I had
the great honor of knowing her
and President Ford and calling
them friends. As so many people
here know, President and Mrs.
Ford were absolutely delightful
and together with their children

last week, but a strong perfor-
mance could provide a harsh con-
trast to Obama's shortcomings.
Heaney added that ABC News's
Martha Raddatz, the debate's
moderator, played a vital role in
making the debate more compre-
hensive than last week's debate.
"The last debate didn't seem
to have a moderator," Heaney
said. "It does affect the quality of
the debate because if you have a
strong moderator you can advance
more issues through the debate,"
Heaney said.

they were steadfast supporters
of Michigan."
Public Policy Dean Susan M.
Collins said while Ford had no
formal training in public policy,
she succeeded in tremendously
impacting women's rights and
influenced some of the most
important public policies of the
modern era.
"She was, of course, married
to a career politician and spent
over 27 years as the wife of a
congressman, vice president and
then president," Collins said.
"But most importantly, Mrs.
Ford had conviction. Outspo-
ken and independent by nature,
upbringing in life circumstance,
she had the courage to speak her
mind. It's no surprise that here at
the University of Michigan and
,at the Ford School, we consider
Mrs. Ford an exemplar for our
students."
Though Ford began study-
ing dance at' Bennington Col-
lege in Vermont, she eventually
returned to her home in Grand
Rapids, Mich., where she met
Gerald Ford and became a dedi-
cated wife and effective cam-
paigner.
In 1975, she was famously
quoted insisting she would not
let her position as first lady pre-
vent her from expressing her
stances on issues like women's
rights, Collins said.
"She proudly called herself a
feminist, and she actively lob-
bied for the passage of the equal
rights amendment," Collins said.
"After the Watergate scandal
and cover up, her husband took
all this promising transparency
to the American people. And in
that charged context, Mrs. Ford
bravely decided to make public
her treatment for breast cancer."
Collins said Ford's courage
and outspokenness was initially
controversial, but Americans

from each side of the political
aisle came to admire her can-
dor and her popularity soared.
Initiatives launched during her
time as first lady de-stigmatized
the discussion of prescription
drug abuse.
"Throughout her life, Betty
Ford spoke her story - an hon-
est, American story about child
bearing, work, illness, recovery
and family," Collins said. "That
story resonated with so many of
her fellow citizens in a way that
political leaders rarely do."
Collins concluded her speech
by encouraging students to look
to Ford as an inspiration and an
example.
"Speak out," Collins said.
"Find your conviction. Tell your
story, your work, your impact,
and your service might be just
the living legacy that President
Ford and the irrepressible Mrs.
Betty Ford would most have
treasured."
LSA senior Mallory Edel
expressed her admiration for
Ford and Brinker, adding that
she enjoyed attending an event
that honored such distinguished
women.
"They created the perfect
storm for breast cancer prog-
ress," Edel said. "I found the
lecture very inspiring. It was an
incredible and amazing talk."
Lisa Braddix, a program
specialist for Komen Detroit
Race for the Cure, said she was
amazed to learn the extent to
which Ford was involved in
promoting the cause of fighting
breast cancer.
"I didn't really understand
how her role led to the explosion
of awareness that we have now,"
Braddix said. "Comparing it to
what it was when she was in the
White House to where we are
today, we really have to give her
a lot of credit."

Boutique caters to
student sexual needs

Costume grand
opening celebrates
sexuality on
campus
By KATIE SZYMANSKI
DailyStaffReporter
Nestled in the basement
below Bongz & Thongz, the
new adult boutique Get Curi-
ous with Safety Girl recently
opened its doors to students
looking to explore their inti-
mate desires.
The boutique, which pro-
vides everything from costumes
and lingerie to toys and safe sex
products, opened at 119 E. Lib-
erty St. in April to customers 18
years old and older. Though the
store opened months ago, it's
now working to promote its ser-
vices to students, starting with
a grand opening costume party
this Saturday.
Brown said she opened her
first safe sex boutique 20 years
ago, but the store closed due
to lack of funding. For Brown,
opening Get Curious with Safe-
ty Girl is a fresh start.
"I feel like this is my sec-
ond chance," she said. "No one
wants to get rich off of this; we
... just want to see it here."
In addition to using her
businesses to promote sexual
health, Brown also performed
in the public-access sex educa-
tion program "Getting Curious
with Safety Girl." Brown said
she uses her role as a sex edu-
cator to help girls boost their
confidence.
"When I was starting out 20
years ago, I wish I could have
gotten some advice. That's why
I started Safety Girl to begin
with," Brown said. "I love help-
ing to build their confidence,
with themselves and their own

body. I tell them to explore
their body, explore it first (and)
be your own best lover."
Brown said the store has
received negative feedback
since opening, but she hopes
customers will see that it is
more than just a sex toy store.
"The most important thing
that I think people get out of
this (store) is it's not a red light
district porno-shop," she said.
"It is very upscale, classy, and
edgy, and (customers) feel com-
fortable being in here ... if you
can laugh and giggle and feel
relaxed enough to ask some
intimate questions ... that's
huge. You don't get that at any
other shop around here."
Brown said while her store
has its educational compo-
nents, it is also a fun way to sell
products.
"I'm not going to be in here in
a suit and a tie with flashcards,"
she said. "I'm going to tell you
what my husband and I did last
night and why we like this toy."
Despite the presence of other
sex and novelty stores in town,
like the S3-Safe Sex Store,
Brown said there isn't a high
level of competition.
"I love the Safe Sex Store,"
she said. "I'm not in competi-
tion with them- I'm not in
competition with anyone. I like,
to spread the love and send cus-
tomers everywhere."
BethAnn Karmeisool, the
owner of S3-Safe Sex Store and
a University alum, said there
is room in Ann Arbor for both
stores because they reach dif-
ferent audiences. She said she
believes both stores will thrive.
"I welcome their business to
the downtown area, because
their store fills a different
need," she said.
Karmeisool pointed out that
unlike Get Curious with Safety
Girl, S3 doesn't sell lingerie.
"I don't have room for linge-

rie (because) it is not part of my
mission," she said. "My mission
is defined and very narrow.
There is a definite need for
lingerie in the downtown Ann
Arbor area, and that's a great
niche that (Get Curious with
Safety Girl) can fill."
Karmeisool said the main
purpose of her business is to
inform customers about safe
sex practices and the safe use
of the store's products.
"(There is) a need for correct
consistent dissemination of
sexual health information," she
said. "The main mission of the
store is education for the user."
She added that she believes
both businesses aim to provide
a comfortable environment for
customers, especially when
selling a sensitive type of mer-
chandise.
"I think that we can all work
together, and people are going
to formulate their own opinion
based upon the experiences
that they have," Karmeisool
said.
LSA sophomore Katelyn
Wolffe said she thinks it's
important for these stores to
promote safe sex practices,
especially on a college campus.
"Even though we are all
pretty smart here, there are
probably a lot of people who
aren't smart when it comes to
(sex)," Wolffe said. "It's good to
have these stores so that people
aren't stupid about it."
The grand opening on Sat-
urday will feature a DJ, games,
tarot card readings, free
spankings from a dominatrix,
photo shoots with Justus Boyz
models, giveaways and bond-
age demonstrations. There will
also be an hourly raffle fund-
raiser to support First Step, a
Wayne County organization
that aids survivors of domestic
and sexual assault and their
families.


At the DPC viewing party, par-
ticipants were invited to vote on
the responses of the candidates
with iClickers and tweet using
specified hashtags, and students
came prepared with laptops and
iPhones to fact check claims made
by the candidates.
Students laughed and com-
mented when Biden grinned and
chuckled at Ryan's responses, but
maintained a respectful silence
when the candidates gave their
responses.
Engineering junior John Corser
said the candidates captivated his
attention for the entire 90 minutes,
and he was more impressed with
the vice presidential candidates
than the presidential nominees.
"I was veryentertained ... it was
much better than the presidential

debate," Corser said.
LSA freshman Julie Sarne
said she watched the debate to
solidify her views on the election
and thought both candidates per-
formed well, though Ryanwasless
relatable.
"I didn't think there was nec-
essarily one clear winner," Sarne
said. "I thought Joe Biden ...
worked a little more with the emo-
tions of the audience, Paul Ryan
seemed a little more scripted,"
Sarne said.
Public Policy graduate student
Caitlin Goddard said the vice
presidential candidates provided
more evidence of their claims than
their presidential counterparts.
"This time (the candidates) are
more factual, last time it was more
about the moderator than the
actual debate," Goddard said.
While students with varying
political backgrounds attended
the DPC event, the College Repub-
licans were united in their support
for Ryan.
Nursing freshman Andrew
Schmitz said he attended the
event to be around other students
who share his views.
"I just wanted to watch the
debate to understand how stu-
pid Joe Biden was ... I came here
because I wanted to be around
fellow Republicans who can laugh
with me and understand the same
beliefs," Schmitz said.

RIT stuns No. 3 Michigan in
comeback overtime victory

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
It wasn't the start Jared Rut-
ledge imagined when he commit-
ted to coach Red Berenson and
the Michigan hockey program.
In fact, the ending to Rutledge's
career debut was borderline
nightmarish.

soft to me."
In all, five goals slippedby Rut-
ledge, each shrinking the Wol-
verines' lead until there wasn't
one left. There was perhaps no
softer Rochester Institute of
Technology tally than the game
winner. Just 14 seconds into
overtime, forward Adam Hart-
ley fired a puck that slid between
Rutledge'slegs and into the net to
seal the 5-4 upset of No. 3 Michi-
gan in the season opener.
Berenson added there's a
chance he'll give freshman
goaltender Steven Racine the
start between the pipes Friday,
but he'll "talk it over" with the
coaching staff, before making a
decision.

looked as if the Wolverines were
heading for a blowoutvictory.
Junior forward Derek DeBlois
scored the first goal of the young

the game off a nifty one-timer
through the slot following an
RIT turnover.
Assisting on the goal was
senior forward Lindsay Sparks,

to have found a nice touch early
on. He also recorded two points
against Windsor.
At the-11:00 mark, senior
defenseman Lee Moffie received
a cross-crease pass and failed to
finish into an open net, but man-

Merrill is expected
to miss at least
six weeks with a
fractured vertebrae
By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer
Early last week, Michigan
hockey coach Red Berenson
said that junior defenseman Jon
Merrill wanted to "leave a lega-
cy." But that dream was quickly
put on hold.
The third-ranked Wolverines
disappointed in the home open-
er against Rochester Institute
of Technology, dropping a 5-4
overtime contest without their
preseason all-conference defen-
seman.
Merrill suffered a frac-
tured seventh vertebrae after
being checked into the boards
during Tuesday's exhibition
against Windsor. The Brighton,
Mich. native will miss at least
six weeks, according to New
Jersey's The Bergen County
Record - the second year in a
row he'll have missed substan-
tial time.
Last season, Merrill was sus-
pended for violating of team
rules, but emerged in the last
19 games with a pair of goals,
nine assists and 42 blocks. His
absence at the beginning of the
year, however, didn't signifi-
cantly affect the Wolverines, as
they reached the NCAA Tourna-
ment as the No.1 seed.
Tuesday was a different story.
"We're disappointed in our
overall defensive game, start-
ing with our goalkeeping, our
defense and our D-zone play,"
Berenson said.
With one less defensive
option in the battery, Berenson
made a few adjustments to his
lines against the Tigers. His
defensive pairings were junior
Mac Bennett with sophomore
Mike Chiasson, senior Lee Mof-
fie with sophomore Brennan

Serville and freshman Jacob
Trouba with junior Kevin Clare,
replacing Merrill.
But Berenson wasn't using the
unexpected line shuffles as an
excuse.
"We played all kinds of dif-
ferent pairs last year," Beren-
son said. "I think it's individual
breakdowns and mistakes. ... We
didn't get the puck out when we
should've."
Though Berenson intended to
pair Merrill with Trouba at the
start of the season, those plans
have taken an obvious hit.
In the third period, the
deflated Wolverines' defense
gave up back-to-back goals.
Though Michigan was plagued
by the Tigers' late surge, Trouba
manned the defensive zone with
physical hits and recorded a pair
of career firsts.
In the first period, Trouba
was sent to the penalty box for
holding, but returned with an
immediate assist on Bennett's
shot to the back of the net to
open the scoring.
Later in the same frame, the
ninth-overall draft pick of the
Winnipeg Jets continued to
wreak havoc on RIT. He skated
behind the goal line and slipped
a wraparound between the posts
unassisted on a power play,
extending Michigan's lead to
3-0.
Through one game, Trouba
lived up to the high expecta-
tions that tagged him in the
preseason, making a statement
in the newly renovated Yost Ice
Arena. But with little defensive
production and a sidelined Mer-
rill, the Wolverines felt the sting
of an early-season loss.
"We're going to miss Jon Mer-
rill, no question," Berenson said.
"He's arguably our best defense-
man and certainly he's a big part
of our D-corps.
"But we said one of the
strengths of our team should be
the depth on defense and we're
going to be tested."

adjusting and
ever evolving.
Paula Cole, who hasn't per-
formed in Ann Arbor since play-
ing at The Ark's 21st Annual "Folk
Festival" in 1998, will be returning
with some changes herself.
The seven-time Grammy nomi-
nee, who has sold over three mil-
lion albums in her 18-year career,
will be performing Sunday at The
Ark.
Cole is on tour to promote her
upcoming album, Raven, which is
set to release spring of 2013.
Cole said her previous album
Ithaca, with songs written mostly
during and about her 2007 divorce
from Hassan Hakmoun, was "very
much a grief outpouring." But fans
can expect something a little dif-

ferent this time around.
"I'm in a good place right now
in life," Cole said. "(I'm) happy,
and I find that when I am happy,
I am more productive and there's
more music flowing out of me."
Cole has grown from her
divorce and childhood struggles,
as evidenced by the title of her
upcoming album, Raven. Cole said
the title partly drew from Native
American culture, where ravens
are viewed not only as symbols of
wisdom, but also as "highly intel-
ligentbirds of transformation."
. Transformation has been a
recurring theme throughout
Cole's career. The artist is now in
her mid-forties, and finds spend-
ing time at home with family
increasingly important.
"I am a mother so I play week-
ends and extended weekends,"
Cole said. "I don't tour like I used
to. I don'tgo on a bus and say good-
bye to my family like I used to. I'm
constantly coming home."
The music industry changed
during the course of Cole's career,
and it continues to do so. Cole's lis-
teners are divided by a generation
gap, which forced her to reevalu-
ate how she markets to her fan
base. It also created moral issues
surrounding digital media.
"I have two very distinct
careers: one pre- and post-Inter-
net," Cole said. "The generation
below tends to not feel morally
compelled toopay for music, where-
as Generation X and above do

feel morally compelled to pay for
music digitally."
Even so, Cole welcomes the
music industry's transformation.
The failure of huge music labels
opens doors for musicians and
provides new ways of marketing
totheir fan base.
"We can exercise our entrepre-
neurial muscles and gather our
fans and go directly tothem," Cole
said. "I think there's more artis-
tic freedom in that. And I like not
going through management chan-
nels. I embrace it."
Cole has certainly embraced
the change in preparation for
Raven's release. It will be Cole's
fourth independently produced
album, which she is funding
through a Kickstarter cam-
paign. Listeners can download
and sponsor the album online,
with rewards going to generous
donors. A $15 dollar pledge or
more gives listeners a download-
able bonus track.
Cole is also utilizing social net-
working sites to get Raven out to
fans.
"This is kind of my first time
going entrepreneurial that way
- through fan funding and going
direct to social media," Cole said.
"(I'm) choosing not to go to
a major label now. I'm choos-
ing to use whatever fan base and
platform I have at this point and
spread my message directly," Cole
said. "It's just me and I'm excited
about it."

Michigan poised to roll Fighting Jilini

0

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
Let's be clear from the outset:
Illinois will have to do just about
everything right on Saturday to
topple the No. 25
Michigan foot- Illinois at
ball team.
It's not an Michigan
impossible Matchup:
matchup, but the Illinois 2-4;
Fighting Illini Michigan 3-2
(0-2 Big Ten, 2-4 When: Satur-
overall) have the day 3:30 P.M.
worst offense Where: Michi-
and worst gan Stadium
defense statisti- TV/Radio:
cally in the con- BTN
ference, scoring
21.2 points per
game and allowing 28.3.
Michigan (1-0, 3-2), on the other
hand, has played stiffer competi-
tion yet still stands in the middle of
the pack in the Big Ten. With losses
to two ranked opponents under
their belts, the Wolverines have
averaged 31.6 points per game and
allowed 21.0 points per game.
Regardless of the statistics, the
game willbe played, and we're here
to break it down. Michigan and
Illinois will take the field at Michi-
gan Stadium for a 3:30 p.m. kickoff
on Saturday.
Michigan pass offense vs. Illinois
pass defense
This is probably the closest pair-
ingheadinginto Saturday, and it's a
battle of weaknesses.
Seniorquarterback Denard Rob-
inson, offensive coordinator Al
Borge4 and the Michigan offense
aren't known for their pass-happy
ways. Robinson is a danger to dash
out of the pocket and beat defenses
on the ground, but he's struggled in
the passing game throughout his
career.
This fall, Robinson has thrown
eight interceptions on just 115 pass
attempts - only Auburn's Kiehl
Frazier has a higher intercep-
tion rate in more than 100 pass
attempts. A 44-13 victory over Pur-
due in West Lafayette last weekend
was the second time in the last 13
games that Robinson didn't throw
an interception.
The debate, though, is whether
the Fighting Illini secondary can
capitalize on Robinson's weakness
in the air game. Their track record
answers "probably not."
Illinois has allowed 226.8 pass-
ing yards per game, and since pick-

ness and relative weakness.
The major weakness is Illinois's
running game, led by redshirt
freshman tailback Josh Ferguson
and sophomore tailback Donovonn
Young. Ferguson has taken over as
the starter this fall, but the Fight-
ing Illini rank last in the Big Ten
averaging just 126.5 rushing yards
per game.
Michigan's front seven, though,
has also struggled. The statistics
may be slightly skewed because
the Wolverines allowed 290 yards
to the triple-option offense of Air
Force in week two, but Michigan
also allowed 232 rushing yards to
No. lAlabama in the season opener.
The Wolverines have held oppo-
nents to 112, 94 and 56 rushing
yards and only one touchdown in
the last three games against Mas-
sachusetts, Notre Dame and Pur-
due.
Given the defensive corps'
recent stonewalling, the Michi-
gan defense takes the advantage
against Illinois's rushing attack.
Edge: Michigan
Special teams
Michigan redshirt junior kicker
Brendan Gibbons (6-for-8 on field
goals) gets the edge over Illinois'
duo of freshman Taylor Zalewski
(2-for-4) and sophomore Nick
Immekus (1-for-2).
Gibbons was 3-for-4 in Michi-
gan's win over Purdue on Satur-
day, and his only miss, a 44-yard
attempt, plunked off the bottom
crossbar and landed short.
Junior punter Will Hagerup is
tops in the nation averaging 49.7
yards per punt, over 13 yardsbetter
per punt than last season.
Though neither team has
returned a kickoff for a touch-
down, Michigan freshman Dennis
Norfleet has returned five kicks for
over 30 yards, while Illinois hasn't
had a single 30-yard return.
Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
Hoke is a perfect 10-0 at home
since he arrived in Ann Arbor.
Michigan is coming off a blowout
victory over Purdue to start the
Big Ten season and hasn't lost to
Illinois since 2009. The defense is
rounding into form and so are Rob-
inson and the offense.
It's all leaning Michigan's way.
Edge: Michigan

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson should have little trouble picking apart the Illinois defense on the ground or the air.

ing off three passes in the season
opener against Western Michigan,
it has forced just one interception
in the last five games.
Edge: Push
Michigan rush offense vs. Illinois
rush defense
You know where this is going.
The Wolverines have Robinson,
one of the most dynamic sprinter
in college football, to go to in the
backfield. He is flanked by redshirt
junior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint. Both accumulated over
1,000 yards rushing lastseason, but
it's been a one-sided affair this fall.
The Michigan offense has aver-
aged 208.4 yards per game this sea-
son, and Robinson averages 135.2 of
those yards.
Toussaint, after missing the
season opener due to a suspension,
has spun his tires, gaining just 42.2
yards per game.
The Wolverines undoubtedly
will continue to try and get Tous-
saint up and running on Satur-

day against an Illinois front that's
allowed 124.5 rushing yards per
game and a Big Ten-high 11 rushing
touchdowns.
The Michigan backfield tandem
should do just fine to carry the
offense past Illinois if Robinson
doesn't find success through the
air.
Edge: Michigan
Illinois pass offense vs. Michigan
pass defense
Like the Wolverines, the Fight-
ing Illini have an offense domi-
nated by the run, especially with
junior quarterback Nathan Scheel-
haase at the helm.
Scheelhaase, who was spelled by
sophomore Reilly O'Toole early in
the season, is a dual-threat quar-
terback that Michigan coach Brady
Hoke has keyed in on during game
week. Hoke said he had the defense
playing a 'chase the rabbit,' drill
this week to prepare for Scheel-
haase.
But Scheelhaase's passing has

leveled out as mediocre at best.
Scheelhaase has maintained a
completion percentage of just over
62 percent during two seasons as
a starter, but he has thrown five
interceptions and just three touch-
downs this fall.
Scheelhaase's favorite target is
junior Ryan Lankford, who has col-
lected 25 catches for 362 yards and
five touchdowns.
Across the line of scrimmage,
Michigan's defense has been
unbreakable in the passing game.
The secondary has allowed just
155.0 yards per game this fall, good
for first in the Big Ten and seventh
nationally.
Despite the defensive line's lack
of pressure on opposing quarter-
backs, the defense has managed
more interceptions (4) thanpassing
touchdowns (3) this fall.

council and works for the fire
department. "We've got kids on our
team now that aren'tgetting a dime
to play football. They love to play
football, and they love to play for
Slippery Rock."
Mihalik stood in front of these
football players, these students.
"I haven't seen that look in a
while, fellas," he said. "We're ready
to play tonight. You know what's on
the line tonight. You know what we
can do tonight.
"The Rock's ready."
And with that, they streamed
out the locker room, through a
small concrete corridor that serves
as their tunnel, through a gate in
the chainlink fence in front of the
bleachers - where there was no
banner to touch - and onto the
field.
High up above the field, on a hill
above the visiting team's bleach-
ers, Slippery Rock President Cheryl
Norton watched the game from
the Gail Rose Stadium Lodge with
donors and other administrators.
It's the Slippery Rock version of
a luxury box, more homey and
with fewer corporate frills. Nor-
ton watched from the inside of the
wooden structure through big win-

dows. Then she moved to the patio
outside, where on a nearby picnic
table sat the quarterback of the Slip-
pery Rock High School team, which
had won the nightbefore.
The president here likes foot-
ball. She likes it just as much as she
likes women's soccer - she took in
that team's game against Shippens-
burg before she went to the football
game. She likes football, it seems, as
much as anything else at the uni-
versity. Football is nice, but football
isn't king.
Three fumbles and abysmal spe-
cial teams play had given Kutztown
a 41-21 lead. In the Lodge, Norton
cheered and grew quietlike the rest
of the crowd. But she kept perspec-
tive.
"It's not a live-or-die sport, peo-
ple can actually play football for
the love of the game," Norton said.
"And not because theythink they're
going to go pro, not because they
think they're the best thing next to
sliced bread, but because they really
love the game. And that's wonder-
ful."
Back down in the locker room
at halftime, there was little of that
perspective.
"I've never been a bitch in my
life," Jeff Thompson, a fifth-year
senior defensive end and one of the
team's leaders, told his teammates.

"That's how we're being treated
every play."
Mihalik, frustrated, began a rant.
"You can't beat an opponent and
also try to beat ourselves," Mihalik
said. "And we're just knocking the
shit out of ourselves. Special teams,
you're killing us tonight."
And he was right. The Rock had
lost a fumble, punted for just 20
yards, missed a field goal, allowed
a 51-yard kickoff return, lost two
more fumbles and allowed a 53-yard
kickoff return just in the first half.
Mihalik promised his team one
of the biggest comebacks in Slip-
pery Rock history. But for a room
full of players payingtheir own way
through school, playingin front of a
few thousand fans, Thompson said
it best.
"Act like you love it!"
And Slippery Rock ran back out
onto the field.
The quarterback here is recog-
nized by some on campus, but no
one takes pictures with him. No one
asks for an autograph. Nigel Barks-
dale is the backup, actually, filling in
for the starter who sustained a head
injury the previous week.
But Nigel Barksdale can play.
After the game, after Barksdale had

rushed for169 yards, thrown for 261
more and combined for five touch-
downs with no interceptions, Miha-
lik would make a comparison.
"He reminds me of someone you
watch, doesn't he?" Mihalik asked.
That someone is Denard Robinson.
On the field, Barksdale is quick
and creative, capable of outrunning
any defender. He's also reckless and
had to leave the game with a knee
injury at multiple badly timed junc-
tures. But his explosiveness can
change games.
After a Thompson sack started
the half, Barksdale seized control.
He rushed for a touchdown, then
threw for another. After one touch-
down, a teammate lifted Barksdale
into the air, much like Taylor Lewan
does with Robinson.
A third touchdown in the half, a
run by Akeem Satterfield, evened
the score, and then another Barks-
dale touchdown suddenlygave Slip-
pery Rock the lead.
For the moment, Barksdale was
the hero. And yet he'd still probably
go largely unrecognized around
campus.
"Being a student football player
at Slippery Rock ... you have your
people," Barksdale said. "You see
them in the stands - there's a lot of
people at our games. We have them
when you're walking through cam-

pus. Good game here, good game
there, you guys could've done better
here, you guys could've been better
there. It's nothing like rah-rah-rah
walking through the halls (like)
you're the big man on campus."
But right now, Barksdale was
the big man on campus. With 10:35
remaining in the game, Slippery
Rock led 49-42.
There is no instant replay here.
No coach's challenges.
When the referees say the ball
is fumbled, the ball is fumbled and
that's that. It doesn't matter that
Slippery Rock had clawed back
from three scores down and let the
lead slip away ontwo straight Kutz-
town touchdowns. It doesn't matter
that the Slippery Rock receiver's
knee had likely been down.
After it was over, Mihalik dis-
cussed the game with Steele, the
equipment manager. Mihalik was
upset, but calm. He looked at the
box score, saw the five turnovers,
the large total yards differential
that favored Slippery Rock and gave
an aw-shucks shrug.
He glanced over.
"I told the team, 'We have to win
for the Michigan guys,' " Mihalik
said.

The coach here has a doctorate.
Slippery Rock is like that.
Dr. George Mihalikhas aDoctor-
ate of Education and has remained
a full-time professor for all 26 years
he's been the head coach.
One hour before a game against
Kutzdown one recent late Septem-
ber day, he chatted and joked with
two reporters visiting from Michi-
gan aboutthe power of the Slippery
Rock name.
Legend has itchatctheborough of
Slippery Rock got its oame from a
group of colonial soldiers who were
heing pursued hy Seneca Native
Americans. The soldiers came
upon a creek and were able to cross
hecause they wore heavy boots.
The Native Americans, wearing
moccasins, slipped on the rocks in
the creek bed. They called the place
Wechachochapohka - literally a
'slippery rock.'
The power of that name has
taken Slippery Rock around the
nation. Most recently, Michigan
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
invited Mihalik and other Slippery
Rock ambassadors to Michigan
Stadium to be recognized during a
game. Mihalik posed for pictures,

was invited to parties and hounded
for autographs.
"We walked up through the stu-
dent section," Mihalik said. "I know
what a rock star feels like. I know
what a celebrity feels like.
"Too often, the big guy is too
enthralled with just who they are
and what they are, who cares about
any little person. And Michigan
is not that way. They've embraced
Slippery Rock University and we
really appreciate the fact that they
announce our scores, and we just
wish everyscore couldbe awinning
score."
As game time approached, he
got upto leave, but notwithout say-
ing something that likely has never
been said in a big-time football sta-
dium before.
"Here's the thing," Mihalik said
with a laugh. "You guys have any
play suggestions, I don't have a
problem with it. Just give them to
me before the game and not after.
Alright?"
The unlikely marriage between
Slippery Rock and Michigan began
in 1959 when Steve Filipiak, Michi-
gan's public address announcer, saw

the funny name on the wire service
ticker. Wanting to inject life into
a boring game, Filipiak read the
score. The fans loved it.
"It got a humorous reaction from
people because a lot of people didn't
even believe there was such a place,"
said Art Parker, who worked in the
control room that day, as he has for
425 consecutive Michigan games.
The scores became a regular
occurrence. The wire ticker even-
tually was replaced by the tele-
phone, and that required Parker
to call each day to people like John
Carpenter, Slippery Rock's sports
information director, for scores. On
his first day, Carpenter had never
heard of the tradition, and puzzled,
he asked the inquisitor from Michi-
gan why he wanted the score,,
As Carpenter related to the Chi-
cago Tribune in 198S, "I said, 'Why
do youpeople want to know what
the Slippery Rock score is?' And he
said, 'If you hold on a minute, I'll
tell you.' The guy held the phone
near the public address announcer,
and then I heard, 'Here's the score
you've all been waiting for: Slip-
pery Rock 27, Waynesburg 7.' And
the place went berserk."
In 1979, Michigan Athletic
Director Don Canham invited The

Rock to play a game in Michigan
Stadium, something Slippery Rock
officials are hopeful will happen
again.
Slippery Rock optimistically
expected 15,000 people to show
up for its game against Ship-
pensburg. Instead, four times
that number, 61,143, attended, a
Division-I record. Canham gave
the team sneakers and cleats. Bo
Schembechler addressed the team,
according to Mihalik. They played
in the Big House again in 1981.
Bob McComas, Slippery Rock's
current sports information direc-
tor, remembers being unimpressed
with Michigan Stadium's sunken
design. That is, until he walked
down the tunnel
"We see this light toward the
end," McComas said. "The whole
group stopped breathing. You look
up and go, 'Wow.'
"You would've thought we were
big-time dignitaries. We're just
some Division II school from Penn-
sylvania."
Yet for a few years, Slippery Rock
grew evasive, and Parker struggled
to get the scores relayed during
games. He theorized that Slippery
Rock felt like it was being mocked.
But that feelingsoon passed.

Nowadays, the Slippery Rock
scores appear around the nation,
from Michigan to Texas. When
McComas fails to text the score in,
Michigan fans grow irate. McCom-
cas recalls one instance when the
Michigan radio station called him,
saying its callers were demanding
the score of the Slippery Rock game.
"They think it's a joke that
Michigan and Texas announce the
scores," McComas said. "But it's
amazing. They want to know. The
people want to know."
The lockerroomhere iscramped,
with lockers in the middle of the
room to maximize space. Before
the game against sutztown, the
members of the Slippery Rock foot-
ball stepped away from their rick-
ety stools and small lockers. They
gathered in the middle of thelocker
room and said the Lord's Prayer.
Most here don't have a scholar-
ship. Slippery Rock only awards 18,
half as many as the teams in its con-
ference.
"If you want to play football,
they're going to come here," said
Ronald Steele, the equipment man-
ager who also serves on the town

At this point, Michigan
fans probably feel like
Nathan Scheelhaase has
been playing college football for
a decade.
But the redshirt junior Illinois
quarterback is in just his third
season as the starter, with another
one on tap next year. A two-time
captain, Scheelhaase has had
plenty of success as a dual-threat
gunslinger for the Fighting Illini.
But the wins haven't been plen-
tiful, which led to a coaching
change after last season.
Former coach Ron Zook was
replaced by Tim Beckman, for-
merly of Toledo, who has led
Illinois to a disappointing 2-4
heading into this week's matchup
against Michigan.
At Big Ten Media Days in July,
the Daily sat down with Scheel-
haase to discuss his new coach, as
well as the quarterback's memo-
ries of going up against the Wol-
verines.
The Michigan Daily: How has
the transition to Coach Beckman's
system gone so far? Were you
apprehensive at all about having
to go through such a big change,
and did you try and help the team
stay focused through it all?
Nathan Scheelhaase: Once
Coach Beckman got in, we all got
comfortable with him in pretty
rapid fashion. It was easy to make
that transition. But those are some
of the things that you worry about,
and there's no question that you
do. I think he understood that
he had made a transition before,
and knew what it took to really
get around to us, and to not only
know us as players on the field but
as men off it. He did a great job. I
didn't have anything to do with
that, that was all him gaining that
respect in a great fashion.
TMD: What's the biggest dif-
ference between Coach Zook and
Coach Beckman that you've seen
so far?
NS: I think just the competitive
nature Coach Beckman has. He
makes everything a competition,
from offensive and defensive GPA,
to spring practices, to strength
competitions in the summer. It's
always a competition. That's defi-
nitely been really exciting for all
of us, because it tells us just that

german, that's going to make the
rteam confident in turn.
TMD: How different is the
offense going to look this season?
NS: Pretty different. It's not
going to look like anything we've
Fn"done the past two years. It's going
to go at a faster pace. We expect
the ball to get to all areas of the
field at any given time. And that's
something that really makes us
more ofa dangerous offense, puts
the defense on its heels. It's some-
thing that as players you feel good
about, because I think there were
times last year, having A.J. (Jen-
kins), as good a player as he was,
we keyed on him a little too much,
and the defense knew that wher-
ever he was, that's where the ball
was going to go. This year, I think
we're becoming more diverse
in how we're spreading the ball
around a little more.
TMD: You've been playing for
quite a while now. Was there a
L$ moment when it sort of clicked for
you, when you became fully com-
fortable?
NS: There's a certain point
when it doesn't matter what
offense you're running, you kind
of have a grasp of things. I think
it happened somewhere probably
freshman year when we played
Michigan in that high-scoring
game. It was one of those games
when I felt like I had complete
. control. I knew what I was look-
ing for, I knew where I was going
j with the ball. Just saw things from
tba different lens.
TMD: Speaking of that game
against Michigan in 2010, now
that you've had a couple years to
tEry reflect on it, just how crazy was it,
to have a score like 67-65?
NS: Honestly, it'll probably
