UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
'U' develops
state's first
embryonic
stem cell line

Monday, October 4,2010

Line developed by
* donated embryos
will be used to study
stem cell growth
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
After spending months and
long hours in University labo-
ratories, University researchers
announced yesterday that they
have successfully created Michi-
gan's first human embryonic stem
cell line.
Five researchers in the Univer-
sity's Consortium for Stem Cell
Therapies began working on the
stem cell line, referred to as UM4-
6, in March. The line - completed
last month - was developed from
donated embryos and will be used
to study how embryonic stem cells
grow.
Human embryonic stem cell
lines are used by researchers
throughout the country to study
human development and poten-
tial treatments for fatal diseases
and debilitating injuries. Few
universities and institutions have
successfully generated lines for

research purposes.
In a press release issued yes-
terday, University President
Mary Sue Coleman praised the
researchers' work and relentless
effort to find cures for diseases.
"This historic achievement
opens the door on a new era for
U-M researchers, one that holds
enormous promise for the treat-
ment of many seriously debilitat-
ing and life-threateningdiseases,"
Coleman wrote. "This accom-
plishment will enable the Univer-
sity of Michigan to take its place
among the world's leaders in every
aspect of stem cell research."
Sean Morrison, director of the
University's Center for Stem Cell
Biology, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that University scientists are
"startingto deliver" on the human
embryonic research Michigan
voters approved in a 2008 ballot
initiative.
"This is just the beginning, we
have big plans," Morrison wrote.
Gary Smith, co-director of the
Consortium for Stem Cell Thera-
pies and professor of obstetrics
and gynecology, said in an inter-
view the stem cell line will be
used for "basic work" like under-
standing how different culture

BLOOMINGTON -
So, Denard. You had anoth-
er pretty good Saturday.
You led Michigan to a
42-35 victory.
over Indiana
in Blooming-
ton and won
your first
Big Ten road
game. No
small feat.
You had JOE
494 total STAPLETON
yards. You
threw three
touchdowns and ran for two
more. This was your second game
this season in which you passed
and ran for more than 200 yards
- something no one else has

ever done in a college career. You
even orchestrated a last-second,
game-winning touchdown drive
(though redshirt junior wideout
Junior Hemingway gave you
some help).
That being said, I know this is
going to sound weird, but...
Could you maybe, I don't know,
slow down a little bit?
Here's the thing: The defense,
for whatever reason, is not good
at all right now. I don't know if
it's passing or coaching or youth
- probably a combination of the
three - I just know it ain't good.
The Wolverines allowed
568 total yards to Indiana, 480
of them through the air. They
allowed 11 third-down conver-
sions. And this isn't a new rev-

elation - you could argue the
defense hasn't had a solid game
since holding Connecticut to
10 points in the season opener.
Heck, they gave up 37 points to
Massachusetts, an FCS team.
Like I said, I'm not sure of the
cause. ButI know they need all
the help they can get on the other
side of the ball.
Which leads me to my point.
Look, I love watching you as
much as the next guy. I love
watching you run the ball with
a speed and agility previously
thought impossible for humans.
Watching you reminds me of
watching Lost; every week, some-
thing completely inexplicable and
out-of-this-world happens, and it
doesn't make any sense. All Ican

do is roll with it and watch as the
Lost writers rewrite the script
and you rewrite the NCAA record
books.
It's just that, well, you score so
fast. Like, blindingly fast. And it
doesn't really give your defense
much time to restup on the side-
lines.
Try to put yourself in their
shoes. Take the first couple drives
of this game, for instance. The
defense gives upa touchdown
to Indiana on the Hoosiers' first
possession of the game after a
long, sustained drive. They finally
get to the sidelines, already suck-
ing wind. You trot out on the
field, shoelaces flapping, and pro-
ceed, two plays later, to dart into

LANDMARK EXPANSION ALCOHOL AND THE ECONOMY
Washtenaw Co. liquor sales
booming, despite downturn

Charley's tops all
bars in county in
sales with more
than $200k worth
ByLINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
Though most cope with a
recession by cutting down costs,
students have proven to be an
exception - specifically when it
comes to buying alcohol.
Despite the ongoing floun-

dering economy across the state
and county, liquor sales in both
Washtenaw County and around
Michigan have grown over the
last year.
In 2009 Washtenaw County
reported a 1-percent gain in its
$31.59 million annual wholesale
liquor purchasing industry. The
top 16 of the 100 establishments
in the county that sell single-
serving drinks on premises
bought more than $100,000 in
liquor from the state, accord-
ing to a report by the Michigan
Liquor Control Commission.
Seven of these 16 establish-

ments cater specifically to Uni-
versity students.
Good Time Charley's, which
ranked at the top of the list,
brought home more than
$200,000 in liquor sales last
year and showed a 6.6-percent
increase over 2008.
Paul Drennan, general man-
ager of Charley's, attributed
the bar's big growth in liquor
sales to the student population,
which has continued to buy
alcohol despite the recession.
"The students are one of
those demographics that have

ELECTION 2010
A2 bike lane plan behind schedule Business leaders debate merits of

Major portions of
plan supposed to be
done by Sept., but
remain unfinished
By JEFF WARANIAK
For the Daily
In order to maintain its place
among the 15 most bicycle-
friendly city in America, Ann
Arbor is adding about 10 miles
of bike lanes and improving 24
miles of the existing bike lanes
around town.

The new bike lanes are part of
a comprehensive non-motorized
transportation plan adopted by
the city in 2007. The goal is to
improve transportation accessi-
bility for Ann Arbor cyclists and
pedestrians.
Federal and local funds
amounting to nearly $300,000
have been used to improve the
city's bike-lane system, with the
most significant changes tak-
ing place along Catherine Street,
North University Avenue, Ashley
Street and First Street. Other
areas receiving updates include
South University Avenue, Hill
Street, East Hoover Avenue and

Geddes Avenue.
Though a major portion of
the project was scheduled to be
completed in September, many
of the lanes are still unfinished.
According to Ann Arbor Trans-
portation Program Manager Eli
Cooper, the installation of bike
lanes is a complex process.
"There are very specific
requirements," Cooper said.
"There are literally tens, if not
hundreds of signs that need to go
up as a result of this project."
Installing proper construction
signs can be a challenge depend-
ing on where they need to be

constitutional convention proposal

Supporters say
convention could
open up Michigan
for business
By A. BRAD SCHWARTZ
Daily Staff Reporter
Come election day, Michigan
residents will vote on Proposal
1 - a statewide ballot initiative
that gives voters the option to call

for a constitutional convention to
rewrite or revise Michigan's state
Constitution.
Last Friday, the University,
Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Regional
Chamber and the Center for
Michigan - a non-partisan think
tank - held a public policy dis-
cussion called Impact 2010 at the
Kensington Court Hotel in Ann
Arbor, where state policymakers
met to discuss the idea of rewrit-
ing the Michigan Constitution.
State Sen. Tom George (R-Kal-
amazoo) spoke in favor of the

proposal and said the potential
benefits of a constitutional con-
vention - referred to as ConCon
- outweigh the risks of not taking
action to help the state.
"Good, well-intentioned peo-
ple are hamstrung by a constitu-
tion that was handed to us when
Michigan was a rich state," he
said, adding that a constitutional
convention is an "opportunity to
re-open Michigan for business."
Arguing that voters should
reject Proposal 1, Dianne Byrum,

Rutgers suicide raises questions

Two Rutgers freshmen

ion of privacy after secrecly
videotaping a fellow studenc'n
involvement in sexual accs in
a dorm room, according to a
Sept. 29 article in the Daily

On Sept. 22, shortly after
learning that he had been
videotaped, first-year Rutgers

suicide, the paper reported.
The students facing charg-

DUKE UNIVERSITY
ALUM'S POWERPOINT
ON SEXUAL CONQUESTS
LEAKED ONLINE
A detailed account of a
recent Duke University grad-
uate's sexual encounters with
13 Duke students, intended to
be seen by only a few friends,
has begun spreading across
cyberspace, according to
Jezebelcom, a feminist biog.
Jezebebcom reported that
author Karen Owens used a
collection of PowerPoint slides
- titled 'An education beyond

the classroom: excelling in the
realm of horizontal academ-
its" - to share her comedic
"wisdom" with a few friends.
Reportedly, one of the
three recipients that Owens
sent the slideshow to for-
warded it via e-mail, and
since then the slides were
received by multiple listservs
before making their way into
the blogosphere. Since the
website's report of the inci-

editor-in-chief of Jezebelcom,
said that two publishing com-

in representing Owens for a
book deal.

labor and bribery for making
students cook and clean in
order to maintain their schol-

If the students did not
perform Chang's tasks, they

NYC mosque's
imam and wife get
death threats
The wife of an imam planning
an Islamic community center and
mosque near ground zero said
yesterday that she and her hus-
band have received death threats.
"For the record, my life is under
threat," Daisy Khan said during a
town hall debate on Islam broad-
cast on ABC's "This Week" news
program.
Khan, who's married to Imam
Feisal Abdul Rauf, said her hus-
band's life also is under threat
but, "We do not walk around with
bodyguards because we love this
country."
Chief police spokesman Paul
Browne confirmed that Khan had
told authorities about the tele-
phone threats she'd received.
"There were telephone threats
made," Browne said, adding the
police department was investi-
gating.
Rauf would be a spiritual lead-
er of a 16-story Islamic center and
mosque planned for lower Man-
hattan two blocks north of where
Islamic extremists destroyed the
World Trade Center on Sept. 11,
2001.

His capture came more than two
weeks after he escaped police dur-
ing a shooting at a shopping mall in
Guatemala City. Two police offi-

Pa. men face 2nd
trial in immigrant
beating death
One night two summers ago,
an illegal immigrant from Mex-
ico brawled with a gang of white
teens from Shenandoah, an old
mining town in the coal fields of
northeastern Pennsylvania.
The fight's outcome is not in
dispute: 25-year-old Luis Ramirez
wound up dead. The question for a
jury is did two forner high school
football stars commit a federal
hate crime.
Brandon Piekarsky and Der-
rick Donchak are charged in
connection with the attack - a

case brought by the U.S. Justice
Department's civil rights division
after an all-white jury acquitted
the defendants of state charges
last year.
Jury selection begins today at
the courthouse in Scranton.
A guilty verdict in the high-
profile trial could send Piekarsky,
now 11, and Donchak, now 20, to
prison for life, as well as soothe
the anger felt by Ramirez's sup-
porters after the May 2009 ver-
dict in Schuylkill County Court.
Piekarsky was cleared of third-
degree murder and ethnic intimi-
dation; Donchak beat aggravated
assault and ethnic intimidation
charges. Both were convicted of
simple assault.

CONVENTION
From Page 1A
Michigan State University trustee
and former state House minor-
ity leader, said a constitutional
convention would only create a
partisan battle and voters would
probably reject the.new constitu-
tion.
"It would be very divisive.
We're going to revive every hot-
button issue all over again,"
Byrum said. "There is no fatal
flaw that needs to be fixed."
Michigan has rewritten its
constitution three times - in
1850, 1908 and 1963. Under the
current constitution, the state
must include a proposal on the
election ballot every 16 years that
gives voters the option to elect
delegates to revise the state con-
stitution. Voters rejected the pro-
posal in 1978 and 1994.
According to a report on Pro-
posal 1 by Julie Cassidy and Joe
Carrasco, both analysts for the
non-partisan Michigan Senate
Fiscal Agency, partisan elections
to choose the 148 delegates for a
constitutional convention would
need to be held within six months.
One delegate would be chosen for
each senatorial and representa-
tive district in the state.
The report states that delegates
would have the power to change
the current constitution in any
way - including revising the doc-
ument, submitting amendments
or making no changes at all. The
revisions would then need to be
voted on by Michigan residents.
The Senate Fiscal Agency
report estimates that the con-
vention and election costs could
exceed $45 million. Byrum said
this price tag is too high for the
state at this time, while George
countered that the cost could be
recouped within one year by hav-
ing the state legislature meet part
time.
The Impact 2010 panelists in
favor of a constitutional conven-
tion saw it as a way to cut the size
of Michigan's state government.
Shrinking the size of the state
legislature, eliminating one of
the houses or making the Senate
and House meet part time would
save the state money, the officials
explained.
"The problems stem from the
size and inefficiencies of govern-
ment," George said.
The two panelists opposed to
the proposal said rewriting the
constitution is too risky, adding
that there hasn't been enough
preparation to ensure fairness in
the election process.
Robert LaBrant, senior vice
president of political affairs and
general counsel for the Michi-
gan Chamber of Commerce, said
previous constitutional conven-
tions lacked preparation and that
voters are not ready to decide on
a convention this year. "I think
this is premature to ask voters of
the state of Michigan to vote for a
ConCon when there has been no
effort to prepare," LaBrant said.
One of the dtbate's contentious

issues was whether a constitu-
tional convention would hurt the
state's economy. Byrum said a
convention would "hit the pause
button on Michigan economi-
cally" because businesses would
be less likely to invest in the state
if the future tax codes and other
rules are unclear.
"We are going to fall behind
economically," she said. "Other
states in the region are going to
get those investments."
But George said the current
structure of the government
already dissuades outside invest-
ment, and a constitutional revi-
sion is needed to draw businesses
to Michigan.
"It's not hitting the pause but-
ton; it's hitting the move-forward
button," he said.
Those against a new consti-
tutional convention argued that
special interest groups would
have too much control over the
convention because only motivat-
ed voters would go to the polls at
the primary election in February.
John Logie, former mayor of
Grand Rapids who is in favor of
Proposal 1, said the quick turn-
around between the November
and February elections wouldn't
allow enough time for outside
special interest groups to mobi-
lize a large campaign.
"This is going to be a very
grassroots-oriented thing," Logie
said.
He added that the constitu-
tional convention would be "too
big" to allow special interests to
take over.
"You don't have anything to
be afraid of if you put 148 people
together for the single task of
forming a new constitution," he
said. "There will e some crazies,
but they will be overruled."
According to a Detroit News
poll released in August, 46 per-
cent of polled voters were in favor
of Proposal 1, 32 percent were
against it and 22 percent were
undecided.
According to LeBrant, both
Michigan gubernatorial can-
didates Virg Bernero and Rick
Snyder are opposed to a consti-
tutional convention. He also said
former Michigan governors Jim
Blanchard, a Democrat, and John
Engler, a Republican, have spoken
out against calling a convention.
LeBrant said a constitutional
convention would be a three-year
process that would not accom-
plish any results, adding that it's
not the Michigan Constitution
that is "holding this state back."
George was optimistic about
the possibilities a constitutional
convention would offer the state.
"It's time for Michiganders to
look at the big picture and look at
this as an opportunity," he said.
"I trust, and we should trust, the
citizens of Michigan to do the
right thing."
But Byrum said the process
would be too expensive, too polit-
ically divisive and too risky for
the state at this time.
"At the end of the day, I main-
tain it will go down in flames,"
she said.

Dismiss Shirvell

*

After unbecoming conduct, Cox must fire asst. AG Politics isn't business as usual

The University is a diverse place of many opinions and
backgrounds. But on one issue, we are united. Support for
Michigan Student Assembly President Chris Armstrong
following attacks on Armstrong by Andrew Shirvell, a University
alum and Michigan assistant attorney general, has been inspiring.
Shirvell, who took a voluntary leave of absence on Thursday, is now
facing a personal protection order from Armstrong and is subject to
a disciplinary hearing from his boss, Attorney General Mike Cox.
Also on Thursday, Cox admitted to The Detroit News that he "made
a mistake" by supporting Shirvell. But overdue apologies aren't
enough. Cox shouldn't have hesitated to dismiss an employee who
clearly doesn't represent the people of Michigan. Cox should remove
Shirvell from his post in the attorney general's office.

Shirvell started his blog to comment
about Armstrong in late April. His initial
post criticized Armstrong and what Shirvell
called his "radical homosexual agenda."
Subsequent posts went on to rage against
Armstrong with unsubstantiated claims and
labels. On Thursday, the blog was limited to
invited readers only. According to an Oct. 1
Daily article, the University's Department
of Public Safety issued Shirvell a trespass
warning on Sept. 14, which bans Shirvell
from campus. Armstrong filed for a personal
protection order against Shirvell on Sept. 13.
The hearing will be held today.
In mid-September, The Michigan Daily
first reported on Shirvell's blog, noting
its offensive language and unsubstanti-
ated claims. This was shortly followed by
a report on WXYZ, Detroit's ABC affiliate.
The story gained national attention when it
was picked up by CNN's Anderson Cooper
last week and was then picked up by news
outlets across the nation. The resulting
public outrage was overwhelming.
As the Daily predicted in its Sept. 16 edi-
torial condemning Shirvell's hatred, the
campus community has seen Shirvell's blog
for what it is: the rants of a bigot. But no one
could have predicted the strength of the
support that the campus community has
shown. The Spectrum Center has created
shirts sporting the phrase, "Elected by us;
Respected by us." And on today's page 3A,
you'll see a advertisement supporting Arm-
strong signed by dozens of campus organi-
zations. Addtionally, the Facebook group
"We Support Chris Armstrong" has more
than 14,000 members as of Sunday - and
it's only one of several groups backing Arm-
strong and condemning Shirvell.
At their Sept. 16 meeting, the University
Board of Regents announced its support of
Armstrong, stating that "When one mem-
ber of our community is targeted, we are all
targeted." And last week, several Univer-
sity officials, including University President
Mary Sue Coleman, voiced their support

for Armstrong. The unity that campus has
shown is inspiring. Our community has been
strengthened with a shared value of respect.
Armstrong deserves praise for the dig-
nity with which he's handled the affair. At
the Sept. 27 MSA meeting, Armstrong stat-
ed that he "will not back down" from these
types of attacks, according to a Sept.28 Daily
article. The strength of character that Arm-
strong has displayed is admirable.
Attorney General Mike Cox's char-
acter has not been so commendable.
Despite public outrage, Cox has failed to
properly respond to Shirvell's actions.
Cox has argued that Shirvell's words are
protected by the First Amendment and
the state's civil service laws and that he
therefore can't dismiss him. But Cox does
have the authority to dismiss Shirvell on
the grounds that his behavior qualifies as
"conduct unbecoming a state employee."
There is no doubt that Shirvell's behavior
is unbecoming - as Cox admitted when
he appeared on "Anderson Cooper 360"
on Wednesday. Though the blog is run on
Shirvell's free time, as a member of the
attorney general's office, he represents
the people of Michigan even when he's not
on duty. And his actions have made many
people doubt the integrity of the attorney
general's office.
During Cox's interview with Cooper,
Cox said that he would consider sending
Shirvell to an "employee assistance pro-
gram" in the event that Armstrong filed
for a personal protection order and it
was granted. But the kind of hatred that
Shirvell harbors for members of the LGBT
community can't be countered by an assis-
tance program. Regardless of the outcome
of today's hearing, Cox must take action.
The attorney general has been indecisive
for too long. His comments to The Detroit
News don't make up for his delay in remov-
ing Shirvell from his post. When Shirvell
returns from his leave of absence, Cox
should not hesitate to dismiss him.

Every time I go out for a run, I
can't help but see all those
goofy yard signs that say we
should "hire" Rick
Snyder to be our -
next governor.
Frankly, I don't'
want to "hire" any
one for governor
- I want to elect
someone. So can
we please stop this
whole nonsense
that running a suc- PATRICK
cessful business
gives you special O'MAHEN
insights into how
to govern that non-
business people
lack?
During his run for governor, Snyder
has been touting his business experi-
ence at Gateway as a key qualification
for his ability to be governor. In doing
so, Snyder joins a long line of entrepre-
neurs that have run for elected office
on the basis of their business lead-
ership. In this election cycle alone,
former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly
Fiorina is the Republican nominee for
the U.S. Senate seat in California while
ex-eBay CEO Meg Whitman is vying
for the governor's mansion there. For-
mer CEOs have made similar bids in
Florida with Democrat Jeff Greene
unsuccessfully challenging for the
open Senate seat and while for CEO
Republican Rick Scott winning his
party's nomination for governor.
The flip side to touting your candi-
date's CEOexperience isthe demoniza-
tion of your opponent asa professional
politician. For example, last week the
Republican Governor's Association
aired an advertisement denouncing
Democratic candidate Virgil Bernero
as a career politician. And the implica-
tion of the advertisement was simple:
Businessmen are out in the real world
creating jobs and making the economy
work and have the ability to clean up
the wasteful government that the
incompetent "politicians" created in
pursuit of an ego trip.
The first problem is that some of

these business people running for
office aren't all that competent at
business, let alone at government.
Take Fiorina for example. She's
famous for her rocky tenure as the
head of Hewlett-Packard, during
which she forced through a disas-
trous merger with Compaq Comput-
er, presided over a 50-percent drop in
HP's share price and left the company
with a $42 million severance package.
Based on that record alone, I'd have
seriously considered voting for her
primary opponent Tom Campbell or
incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer
- both career politicians.
Scott's business expertise con-
sisted of founding and running
Columbia/HCA, the nation's largest
for-profit hospital chain. The com-
pany grew quite profitable, in part
because it engaged in rampant fraud.
HCA overbilled Medicare - a taxpay-
er-funded program - so egregiously
that the company agreed to pay a
$1.7 billion fine to the government
in 2001, a dubious record that still
stands today. Scott's primary oppo-
nent, Florida Attorney General Bill
McCollum, might have been a career
politician, but at least he sent crimi-
nals to jail instead of installing them
in the executive boardroom.
But I don't merely wish to keep
incompetent business people out of
political office (nor to hint that Sny-
der is incompetent - all indications
are that he's quite the opposite), but
rather to question the idea that busi-
ness experience somehow provides
brilliant insight into running a gov-
ernment that the rest of us mere mor-
tals don't have.
Atits core, the goal ofbusiness is to
make profits. The goal of democratic
government is to provide for the com-
mon good with the consent and input
of the governed. There's a difference
there.
Often the profit incentive does
line up with the common good. A
background as a business executive
can help efficiently manage public
resources. But a business background
is neither necessary nor sufficient to

be a good financial manager.
Nor is efficiency the only crite-
rion of good democratic government.
Academics often get derided for not
living in the real world. But they gen-
erally have a superior grasp of broad
policy problems from taxation and
health care to infrastructure and ecol-
ogy. Though many entrepreneurs have
experience in these issues, it's often
only in the narrow context of running
their business. Yet you never hear a
groundswell of support to get more
professors into elected offices.
Being a CEO
doesn't qualify
someone for office.
The point is that business people do
bring some relevant skills and knowl-
edge that are useful to governing and
some might be quite capable in office
- but so do people inother professions
like teaching, social work, medicine,
law, economics and the arts.
That brings me to my final point
that power can corrupt anyone - and
CEO's are just as vulnerable as the
rest of us. Whitman by most accounts
did an exemplary job running eBay,
but numerous allegations of shady
stock dealings involving Goldman-
Sachs and abuse of employees dog her
record. Similar problems followed
Greene into his unsuccessful race.
That's a sobering point for Snyder
to think about as he contemplates his
likely victory in November. He cer-
tainly has plenty of skills as a busi-
nessman that might translate into a
successful governorship. But he can
drastically increase his effectiveness
if he remembers that he doesn't know
everything and incorporates the skill
sets of people from outside of the
business world as well.

AIDA ALIl I
Muslim misconceptions

When Florida pastor Terry Jones announced
his plans to burn the Quran on the ninth anni-
versary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, he sparked
worldwide protests and indignation. All that
this threat of burning the Quran made me real-
ize was that the world still had much growing
up to do.
Let's start at the root of the problem - Osama
Bin Laden. Bin Laden today represents someone
who is pure evil, is in possession of unknown
power, has been able to avoid capture for 9
years and is a Muslim. He was responsible for
the hijacked planes that crashed into the World
Trade Center and Pentagon. He killed thousands
and claimed he did it in the name of religion.
But that isn't true. Islam doesn't preach vio-
lence. Since the beginning of the war on terror,
Islamic practices have been misunderstood. The
original teachings are blurred because of the
impression that these militants give and the per-
ception of the people affected by this violence.
It isn't the teachings of their religion that
lead these men to war. It's simply the unsound-
ness of their minds that make them this way.
There are always extremists in every religion
and in every aspect of the society. The general
public doesn't agree with these extremists, but
there are some who do. And the more you tell
any extremist that he is wrong, the more deter-
mined he will become to prove his relevance.
Take some poverty-ridden, uneducated civil-
ians with religion as their only crutch, throw
in a bunch of malicious, heartless men who are
thirsty for power and you get a team of brain-
washed militants who fight for a cause only they
understand and believe in. If only we had stayed
united and not discriminated against each other
on the basis of religious differences at a time
when the world was blaming Islam, things might
have been better in the present. But now that so
many years have passed, can we really still not
understand the core of the problem? Are we still
pointing fingers and raising guns against each
other because of the Gods we believe in?
The threat to burn the Quran didn't so much
hurt me as disgust me. To think that burning

a holy book could solve any problems is fool-
ish. Even though the Quran burning didn't take
place, there were several copycat incidents.
One such incident was in East Lansing, where
the remains of a burnt Quran were found in
front of the Islamic Center near Michigan
State University. This incident sparked inter-
national outrage and resulted in an attack on a
church in India. Does anyone else see a pattern
here? This is just a ridiculous cycle of events in
which nobody is right and nobody wins.
This religious war has been going on for a
while, but it's time we realize that religion is
only a front. We are educated, smart people who
understand the capabilities of the human mind
and the human thirst for power. With the current
situation, it's like when the bad guy forces people
who could collectively defeat him into fighting
against each other instead.
Park51, the proposed mosque and Islamic
Center a few blocks from ground zero, might
do good in bringing the community together.
It will perhaps create acceptance and respect
amongst the common American toward the
Muslim faith. And there is definitely no reason
for it to be offending anyone.
The final thing that I have to mention is ste-
reotyping. How many people reading this view-
point have really known a Muslim person in
their everyday life? The chances are pretty good
with Michigan being one of the largest Muslim-
populated states in the U.S. But for many others,
the only Muslims they know are the ones they
see on TV holding guns and creating war. That
is simply awful. There are over1 billion Muslims
in the world. A mere fraction of them are set-
ting the image for the rest.
The bottom line is that it's not the religion
that is to be condemned. Let this be the end of
the 'International Burn a Koran Day' idea -
which was absolutely absurd to begin with. Let
us understand the reasons behind terror and
resolve existing issues instead of creating new
ones.
Aida Ali is an LSA sophomore.

This Thursday morning - at
the U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services office
in Detroit - I will
take the Natu-
ralization Test in
order to become
an American citi-
zen. And, barring
an unprecedented
and unforeseen'
mental break-
down, I expect to
pass. After all, the TOMMASO
questions askedP
during the test are PAVONE
along the lines of
"Who is our cur-
rent president?"
And so by the late morning on
Thursday, there is a 99-percent prob-
ability that I will be an American cit-
izen. That is, in addition to being an
Italian citizen. Oh, and also a citizen
of the European Union.
In essence, I will technically be a
tri-citizen - a citizen of two nations
and of a supranational polity. That
should make me a very confused indi-
vidual and some might ask where my
loyalties lie.
This raises a fairly existential ques-
tion: Is citizenship simply a loyalty
pledge or does it represent something
greater and more meaningful? My
experience seems to suggest the latter;
that citizenship is representative of my
individual and cultural identity.
As an Italian citizen, I know full
well that citizenship isn't about blind
loyalty - I find myself criticizing
Italy just as often as I praise it and
I don't consider this being disloyal.
After all, when I criticize the Italian
party system, Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi or the Italian judicial sys-
tem, I'm doing so because I feel that
constructive criticism engenders

progress. In this light, loyalty and
criticism often operate in harmony.
When I reflect back on my Italian
citizenship, I think about my child-
hood, my family and my culture. I
think back to our chaotic Christmas
family reunions where dozens of fam-
ily members would squeeze into a little
bourgeois apartment in Rome, greeted
by copious amounts of food and des-
serts, laughing and gesticulating wild-
ly while discussing politics and family
issues. often, the red glow from the
burning tips of a few cigarettes would
dance around the apartment like fire-
flies, diffusing a light haze that made
the experience feel even more dream-
like. And there I was, a child of no
more than four or five, watching this
play-like drama unfolding before me,
soaking up its vitality as I ate some of
the best food of my life.
When I move to consider my Euro-
pean Union citizenship, I think back
to my time in Brussels, Belgium,
which is the de-facto capital of the EU.
I remember my experience attending
a private British elementary school.
For the first time, I was in the minor-
ity. I was no longer surrounded by
native Italian Catholic students.
Rather, my peers came from all over
the world - they looked different,
spoke different languages and held
different social and cultural identi-
ties. The whole experience reminds
me of the ideals encompassed in the
EU motto, "United in Diversity." We
often didn't appreciate the opportu-
nities inherent in our differences -
rather, we frequently argued, made
fun of each other and formed cliques.
Europe is more diverse now than
ever and, just as with my elementary
school experience, Europeans have
yet to fully understand, accept and
celebrate this diversification.
So I'm left to wonder what my

American citizenship will end up
representing. Just as it has taken me
time to understand what being "Ital-
ian" and being "European" means to
me, I'm sure that it will take me years
to begin to recognize the significance
of being "American."
National
identities aren't
mutually exclusive. 0
One thing I've learned, however, is
that the identities symbolized in citi-
zenship status aren't mutually exclu-
sive. By this I mean that my identity
as a European is largely influenced by
my Italian cultural perspective. And,
just as I process my experience living
in the United States through the lens
of being a European immigrant, liv-
ing abroad has allowed me to better
understand what it means to be a citi-
zen of Italy and of Europe.
I consider becoming a tri-citizen to
be another step forward in this jour-
ney. It's a geographic journey that has
allowed me to live in three separate
countries and five different cities. It's
a legal and political journey that has
granted me the rights and privileges
that accompany citizenship status.
And it's also been a personal jour-
ney, one that has forced me to better
define myself as an individual and as
aglobal citizen.
Thinking about it this way, I couldn't
be more grateful for what I've experi-
enced. And it's not over - on Thursday,
everything will change again.

the end zone so quickly it appears
to the untrained eye that you tele-
ported there.
And right after, the poor defense
has to get back on the field! If you
think about it, it really isn't fair.
And this isn't the first time this
has happened. Remember the first
score against Notre Dame? That
pass to redshirt sophomore Roy
Roundtree? Yeah, that took you a
whopping five seconds to complete.
Even later in the game, you started
one scoring drive from the two-
yard line. The defense was antici-
pating along, sustained drive, but
you couldn't resist, could you? You
just HAD to eat up 87 yards on one
run. Goodness gracious.
You may be thinking, But Joe,
Ijust take what the defense gives
me. How can you expect me to think
STEM CELLS
From Page 1A
conditions impact the derivation of
human embryonic stem cells.
"This line in itself is what we
could consider a normal embryonic
stem cell line so it does not have any
genetic abnormalities," Smith said.
In the future, researchers hope
to create lines that contain genetic
defects, which can be used to study
specific diseases such as Hunting-
ton's and Parkinson's disease.
"There are very few, if any, dis-
ease specific lines on the registry,"
Smith said.
The National Institutes of Health
registry currently contains 75
human embryonic stem cell lines.
Once University researchers gen-
erate enough cells for distribution,
they plan to submit an application to
the NIH and offer the line - which
would become number 76 - for the
registry.
Since U.S. District Court Judge
Royce Lamberth blocked federal
funding for embryonic stem cell
research in August, researchers
have been concerned that scientists
will not be able to use the line if the
ruling remains in place. Smith said
the field is "in a bit of turmoil," and
he hopes the U.S. Court of Appeals
willoverturnthe decisionso Univer-
sity researchers can carry on with
their work.
"The responsible thing to do for
us is to actually make these lines
compatible with being on the regis-

about how much timeI'm spending
on thefield whenI have all the other
responsibilities of a starting quar-
terback to think about? Solid point.
Here's mine: Iam thoroughly
convinced you can do anything you
feel like on a football field, whether
you know it or not.
You hold defenses in the palm of
your hand. They are at your will.
You alone decide their fate, and
with a slight clench of your fist, you
can grind them to dust. DUST, I
say! - (ahem) sorry... I got a little
excited. That was embarrassing.
Anyway, I've seen you do things
on a football field I never thought
possible. So is it really that much
of a stretch to ask you to not only
orchestrate the offense, run the
ball, pass the ball, occasionally kick
the ball and conductcgame-winning
drives, but to also make sure you
give the defense some rest on the
sideline? I don't think so. Maybe it
won't make a huge difference, but
try and then let the politics make its
wayout," he said.
Sue O'Shea, co-director of the
Consortium for Stem Cell Therapies
and a professor of cell and develop-
mental biology, said in an interview
the plan is to make the line available
on the registry so researchers at the
University and other institutions
canuse it.
"Otherwise, there is not much
point in makingthe cell line," O'Shea
said.
While University researchers
now know what it takes to produce
a human embryonic stem cell line,
Smith said all future lines are "going
to take time."
"The kind of the interestingthing
here is that not many people have
done this," he said. "As you do it, you
realize you can't really speed up the
process."
However, Smith said the goal is to
work on multiple lines at the same
time so that more than one can be
generated every few months.
"Hopefully, as we ramp up here,
we'll be able to do a few lines at a
time and have them overlapping,"
he said.
Accordingto the press release, the
stem cell line was derived from a five-
day-old embryo about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence. A
patient who no longer needed the
embryo for reproductive purposes
donated it to the University.
In November 2008, Michigan
voters passed a ballot initiative
called Proposal 2 that allows women
to donate unwanted embryos for

right now, that defense needs all
the help it can get.
Of course, make sure you're still
scoring around five or six touch-
downs per game - even with the
defense getting more rest, some-
thing tells me you'll still need to
score a heckuva lot of points for
Michigan to win. Shouldn't be too
much of an issue - you've scored
at least two touchdowns in each
game since the season opener, and
against Bowling Green you only
needed a quarter to do that.
That's not asking too much, is
it? Wait - I forgot one thing: stay
healthy. I know the media has been
saying that so much it's becoming
a cliche, but justthought I'd men-

research. Before the proposal, fertil-
ityclinicswere forcedtothrowthem
away.
Since January, four couples have
donated approximately 20 embryos
to the University, and Smith said
many people have contacted him
about donating.
"At least once a week we have
interactions with somebody who's
wanting to donate embryos," he said.
Besides generating a new stem
cell line, researchers are making
induced pluripotent stem cells - a
technique that involves repro-
gramming adult body cells to have
therapeutic capabilities similar to
embryonic stem cells. Pluripotent
cells are deemed less controversial
because they can be derived from a
patient's own cells.
O'Shea said researchers will be
able to use pluripotent cells to study
disease progression and look at
factors that interfere with disease
growth.
"It has real potential (to be used)
in drug development for diseases
that develop over time," she said.
After years of stem cell research
restrictions, Smith said it's "been a
long road" in gettingto this point.
"Even before Proposal 2 passed,
this is something that many of us
talked about and looked toward the
future for," he said. "When we got
our first embryo, when we got our
approval, when we got the first lines
growing, when we found out that
they were genetically normal - all of
these little steps have been exciting
and rewarding."

BIKE LANES
From Page 1A
placed. It can take a construction
crew anywhere from 10 minutes
to one hour to install a sign if it
needs to drill through concrete.
"As travelers, we don't real-
ize the difference between put-
ting up a sign in a lawn area as
opposed to erecting a sign in an
area that has a sidewalk," Cooper
said.
The weather can also present
difficulties when installing bike
lanes. In order for the white paint
used to mark bike lanes to adhere
to the street, the pavement must
be above a certain temperature.
If the pavement is the wrong
temperature, the thick lines and
"sharrow" - which stands for
"shared road" - emblem may
not survive harsh weather condi-
tions.
A sharrow is a traffic sym-
bol painted on pavement, which
shows a white bicycle picture
with two chevron arrows above
the bicycle. The sharrow indi-
cates the location in the road
where a cyclist should ride to
ensure his or her safety.
Sharrows are placed in areas
where the road isn't wide enough
for a standard bike lane, but bicy-
tle traffic is still heavy. They can

be found in downtown Ann Arbor
and in low-speed areas through-
out the city, particularly where
curbside vehicles are parked. The
symbol serves as a reminder that
the roadway needs to be shared
appropriately, Cooper said.
"It's a comprehensive approach
to creating a visual environment
where the motorist should be
aware that they need to be driv-
ing slowly," Cooper said. "We
want cyclists to feel welcome in
the street, and we want motorists
to be alert that cyclists are likely
to be present."
Safe cycling is a critical ele-
ment to the development of the
new bike lanes. As a cyclist him-
self, Cooper said he is aware of
the dangers that a cyclist is likely
to encounter.
"I know the different feeling
and perception I have of being
safe when I'm in a segregated
bike lane, as opposed to when I'm
riding in mixed traffic," he said.
Despite the proper signage and
security measures, bike safety
can only be ensured by the indi-
vidual, Cooper added.
"I firmly believe that I do have.
rights as a cyclist, but it is really
important to defend myself and
be absolutely aware of what's
going on around me," Cooper
said. "Each cyclist has a respon-
sibility to themselves and their

Monday, October 4, 2010 - 5A
health and well being."
LSA junior Kayla Paulson, who
rides her bicycle to class, said she
would like to see more bike lanes
installed around campus - add-
ing that bike lanes make it safer
for cyclists like herself.
"The bikes aren't really watch-
ing for the cars, and the tars
aren't really watching for bikes,"
Paulson said.
Safe and suitable transpor-
tation is valued not only by the
city but also by the University,
according to Jim Kosteva, the
University's director of commu-
nity relations.
"We're prepared to cooperate
as best as we can with the city in
providing amenities and support
for alternative transportation,"
Kosteva said. "We work with the
city in trying to incorporate all
modes of transportation in our
own projects."
As the city and the University
continue to accommodate resi-
dents and students by providing
an even more efficient bike-lane
system, officials are hopeful that
the number of cyclists will grow.
"We're not putting stripes on
the street just to put stripes on
the street," Cooper said. "We
have a goal, and our goal is to see
the level of cycling increase to be
among the leading communities
nationally."

a limited amount of disposable
income," Drennan said. "When
they don't have it they manage to
find it and find a way to come in
and have a good time."
Drennan said that he has
seen some customers hold back
because they're tight on spending
money, but it hasn't been an over-
all trend.
"We've noticed a little pinch in
some of our guests' spending hab-
its," he said.
While some have been pinch-
ing pennies, Charley's customers
haven't adjusted their preferenc-
es to make buying a round cheap-
er, Drennan said.
"It's still the same kind of mix
between draft sales and liquor
sales," Drennan said.

choices are changing based on
their costs.
Chris Hesse, owner and man-
ager of Rick's American Cafe,
said the bar has definitely noticed
a change in the types of sales at
the bar.
"The liquor and the type of
drink people are drinking are
definitely the lower-end drink,"
Hesse said. "We've found our-
selves trying to special some of
the higher-end drinks to keep
them moving that we wouldn't
typically special."
Due to a combination of the ail-
ing economy, student preference
and Rick's specials, Hesse said
beer sales have greatly increased
at the cafe.
"Beer numbers have gone up
for us dramatically in the last
two years. Our bottles sales have
increased, and our draft sales
have decreased," Hesse said,
attributing this difference to a
Rick's promotion.

Statewide liquor retailers have
also noticed a more acute change
in the type of alcohol patrons
purchased last year. Andrea Mill-
er, spokeswoman for the Michi-
gan Liquor Control Commission,
said sales of less-expensive liquor
have been increasing as custom-
ers are holding back because of
the economy.
"What we found is that people
are definitely still buying liquor,
they just weren't buying anymore
top-shelf liquor," Miller said.
"The cheaper, bottom-shelf, sec-
ond-shelf liquors were just sell-
ing more."
Lorin Brace, manager of Vil-
lage Corner, said most of the
store's expensive liquors have
still sold, except for top-shelf
scotch. But overall, Brace said
Village Corner's profits have
been steady.
"There hasn't really been any
difference," Brace said. "People
still buy liquor."

Things get weird
at Sub Terrain'

Young brings 'Le Noise'

By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
If "Inception" made you question the
meaning of reality, the University may
have something to
blow your mind. At the Sub Terrain
School of Art & Design's
gallery Work - Ann Tomorrow,12
Arbor, an exhibit titled p.m.tolTp.m.
"Sub Terrain" explores Work - Ann Arbor
different levels of con-
sciousness through
various forms of media - from paintings
and sculptures to an interactive mask
projection.
These levels of consciousness range
from examining sleeping patterns -
either peaceful or troubled - in a pho-
tography piece by Mira Burack, to a
fantastical and surreal state, shown in a
projection piece of the islands over which
Amelia Earhart reportedly disappeared
and commenting on her intriguing image
in today's world.
"Some of the pieces seem literal, like
The Burrow by Melissa Jones," said
Andrew Thompson, the show's cura-
tor and a lecturer in the School of Art
& Design. "It's referencing this human
child that is feral, living in an under-
ground dwelling in an iron suitcase, so
it's kind of an underground space you can
fold up and take with you."
Inspiration for "Sub Terrain" came
from Thompson's previous work with
independent artist Audrey Russell.
"Audrey had a solo show a few years
ago in her hometown, Greenville, Ten-
nessee, and she hired me to write her
exhibition essay," Thompson explained.
"I liked the thoughts I put down so I
thought this could be a show. I called her
and I was like, 'Audrey I have an idea for
a show and you have to be in it because
you're the foundation for it."'
Russell commonly works with land-
scapes and parts of the body.
"It's all kind of a mystery where
things feel familiar, but there's a lot of
unexplained elements going on, and you

wonder how much is weird psychologi-
cal baggage and how much is free asso-
ciation," Thompson said. "That's the idea
behind the show, finding other artists
that have work that has an element of
mystery to it."
With an idea in mind, Thompson had
to find a space to house the "Sub Terrain"
exhibit. One of his top two choices was
Work . Ann Arbor. The gallery allows
anyone in the Art & Design at the Uni-
versity to propose a show, including stu-
dents, lecturers and faculty members.
The pieces in the exhibit have widely
varying backgrounds and contexts to
them, with influences from literature,
history and medicine. Some of the piec-
es are frightening and shocking, such as
Sleep of Reason by Rachel Frank, which
features photography of three figures in a
room wearing donkey costumes.
"She references Francisco Goya, who
has pieces about death and people as
demons," Thompson said. "So these don-
key people are like monsters in this state
of being."
Your mind is the
scene of the art
exhibit.
There is one piece in "Sub Terrain"
by the University's own Scott Wagner
and Morgan Morel, both Performing
Arts Technology majors in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance. Their interac-
tive project, titled Face Lift, gives one
person the opportunity to look into a
camera that projects his or her face into
the openings of a mask. Another person
looks through the mask and sees that pro-
jection.
"It was a combination of our mutual
interests," Wagner said. "Morgan was
doing a lot of video-on-video work,

Veteran rocker harnesses
power of the full moon
in latest release
By EMMA GASE
DailyArts Writer
Le Noise is the most recent of Neil Young's
34 solo albums. Yep, this is his 34th - and
that isn't even including
his material with Buffalo
Springfield and Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young. NeilY
Damn. This guy is also
64 years old, though Le Noise
one would never know Reprise
that from his live shows,
where he rocks harder
than 99 percent of our current crop of
rock'n'rollers. Not to mention he has influ-
enced basically every respectable modern
guitar-savvy band today (we're looking
at you, Built to Spill and Wilco). So what
does this veteran have left to prove? Isn't
he cool enough already?
Le Noise is simply Neil and his guitar.
To add a little mystique, he recorded only
during a full moon. The name Le Noise is
a tongue-in-cheek nod to Young's famous
brainchild producer, Daniel Lanois (U2,
Bob Dylan). Recording took place entirely
at the producer's home studio, where he
laid down the underlying space-scape son-
ics that permeate the entire album, filling
the traditional songs with odd echoes and
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot-esque white noise.
In an interview with the Chicago Tri-
bune, Young described his guitar's tone on
Le Noise as sounding "like God." And he's
correct. This behemoth of a tone could
easily level a building. "Sign of Love"
treats listeners to the chunkiest guitar
sound Young has used since "Hey Hey My
My-(Into the Black)" - a sound so deep
and thundering that you can practically
feel it, like a bass in your stomach.
Young's trademark plodding rhythm
and palm-muting strum style are present
throughout the record. He also busted out
the big gun to record the majority of tracks:
his trademark Gretsch White Falcon, the
Bentley of guitars, quite possibly the most
ostentatiously stunning instrument (visu-

I was told there would be Le Funk."
ally and aurally) in his collection.
The theme of loss hangs heavy on Le
Noise. Young is getting older, and recent-
ly lost two of his closest colleagues, one
being his band's steel guitarist and close
friend, Ben Keith. On opener "Walk with
Me," despite a kick-ass guitar riff and
optimistic."oohs" and "aahs" in the mid-
dle-eight, Young takes on a more melan-
choly disposition: "I lost some people I
was traveling with / I missed a soul in the
old friendship."
But fans looking for the simple lyrical
genius and poetic beauty of the songs circa
Rust Never Sleeps or After the Goldrush
will have to look elsewhere. The lyrics in
Le Noise, while straightforward, are often
bland and overly sentimental. A prime
example is from acoustic ballad "Love and
War": "The saddest thing in the whole wide
world / Is to break the heart of your lover."
Not exactly world-shaking stuff, but hey,
Young's allowed to get a little soft in his old

COURTESY OF REPRISE
age. Nevertheless, the echo-y Spanish-style
acoustic finger-picking saves the song.
Le Noise proves that Neil Young is rel-
evant in the year 2010 and showcases his
boldness and risk-taking. On the other
hand, as much as Young continues to
evolve and try new sounds, this is not an
album that fans will think to revisit after
the initial few listens. Le Noise really is
just another arguably failed grand experi-
ment from an artist who had a prime so
enduring and so expansive that few things
ever measure up. The songs on the album
are almost too personal to relate to, and
contain little actual enjoyment in the
song craftsmanship. It is easy to become
absorbed in the musical intrigue of the
sonics created by Lanois that you forget
that the songs themselves, when absent
from modern tweaking, are simply aver-
age. Young is still cool, but not cool enough
to rescue this peculiar record from gather-
ing figurative dust in your iTunes library.

these little clubs - either you're in
my club or you're not. And so it's
like you're attacking people's club if
you're not a fan of their movie."
Gleiberman is unapologetic
about the things he likes and
doesn't like.
"I think the phrase 'guilty plea-
sure' has become a bullshit term,"
he said. "There are so many things
that people watch and enjoy that
may not necessarily be works of
art, but are they really guilty about
watching them?"
"I think that 'Jersey Shore' is
a show that some people tend to
think of as a guilty pleasure, but
that's because they don't want to
own up to what really engages
them," Gleiberman said.
"Something in America that
hasn't been always there has been
this party culture, this kind of
spring break, frat house party cul-
ture. And okay, so youth party cul-
ture has become a bigthing, and the
people on 'Jersey Shore' are really
good at it."
"I also think that the fights on
that show are great," he added.
"Sure, we all know that parts of
reality television have elements of
manipulation to it, but it's too easy
to say it's all staged. And when you
watch a show, your gut can kind of
tell you whether it's real or not. And
I have seen fights on'Jersey Shore,'
whether they're physical fights or
verbal fights, that remind me of
scenes of Scorsese.
He continued, "When you think
about what people love a movie
about 'Goodfellas,' like Joe Pesci
throwing a psychopathic fit, it's
partly the mesmerizing quality of
watching somebody get so angry. I
think that could be there in 'Jersey
Shore'And while that doesn't make
'Jersey Shore' a work of art, there's
certainly a mesmerizing quality
to it. And so why do (people) have
to be calling something like this a
guilty pleasure?
Gleiberman also addressed the
question that many have struggled
to answer - the state of criticism in
the future.
"There's sometimes the tempta-
tion to take what's going on online
less seriously than what's in print,"
he said. "But there's a part of me
that believes that a piece of writing
is a piece of writing. The second you
put two words together - I don't
care if it's an email, an article or a
presidential speech - it's a piece
of writing, it's a piece of prose - it
can be good or bad or somewhere in
between."
"Of course there are going to
be differences, and I'm interested
in talking about them," he added.
"But before you do, isn't it worth
saying that, gee, the fact that what
we read used to be on dead trees
and now is digital - does it really
mean that the content is chang-
ing so profoundly? Can't it just be
that the means of transmission is
changing?"

ast winter I took Introduc-
tion to Film, Video and
Television Production.
The most valuable experience I
obtained from
this class was
the hands-on
work with
16mm film. I
went into the
class looking
for an introduc-
tory course on ANKUR
filmmaking SOHONI
and came out
with a better
understanding of the roots of the
art itself.
In one especially memorable
session, we learned how to manu-
ally thread film through an old
Kodak projector. The projector that
we were working on seemed to be
in good order, so we did our best to
follow our instructor's directions.
Everything was set up: All the
film was thread into the take-up
reel, all the spikes in the sprockets
and all the necessary gates closed.
One of my group members pushed
the lever forward and the film
started to roll.
While the projector ran, she
excitedly turned around to our
other classmates and exclaimed,
"It's like the Dharma Initiative!"
referring to the training films in
TV's "Lost." But that's when our
projector went horribly wrong.
Something got caught, it didn't
advance, film went flying upwards
and for just a few moments too
long, a single frame was trapped in
the beam of light.
The surreal result was the
projected image of a frame of
film melting from the inside out.
Whether you've seen it before in a
movie like "Persona" or as a video
editing effect, the experience of
seeing a gaping hole in the cellu-
loid on a physical strip of film was
profoundly strange.
I learned, through that expe-
rience and our continued use
of 16mm film, to appreciate the
inherent difficulties the physi-
cal medium entails - to respect
filmmaking at its most basic level.
Moving on to a digital video proj-
ect later in the class, it was never
really satisfying to play with Final
Cut Pro when we had already
worked with film.

"(The room) really encloses the

we had the opportunity to set it up

is how we originally intended,"
Wagner explained. "In the original

dred feet long."

mysterious and thought-provoking
works, but pieces that are eye-
catching as well.
"I want all the work to be
intriguing enough and interesting
enough to look at on an aesthetic
value, whether it's color or form
or subject matter," Thompson
explained. "The exhibit is kind of
like a buffet - there's all these dif-
ferent visual flavors going on. If
someone wanted to see a painting
show they would only be partially
satisfied, so I tried to make some-
thing for everybody and to repre-
sent different media."
"Sub Terrain" is built to encour-
age confrontation of subjects
unknown to the viewer.
"You look at it and think you can

understand, you think, 'I can break
this down, I can analyze it and it'll
make sense,' but really the work
has this element where it defies
precise logic," Thompson said. "It's
not a Freudian show."
Having less than a week to
replace the old show in the gal-
lery, Thompson and Mark Nielsen,
the director of the gallery, worked
tirelessly to finalize "Sub Terrain."
In the end, Nielsen had only posi-
tive things to say about the result.
"I personally find the show
extremely satisfying," Nielsen
wrote. "The work is compelling,
edgy, and often surprising, and
was curated and installed with a
lot of sensitivity and respect for
each individual work."

Blind Pig crowd will
cheer for Ra Ra Riot

There are a lot of bands out

collegiate thing.

York-based sex- Tonight at

stand out from
the rest of the
baroque bands inundating today's
indie-chamber pop scene.
While its 2008 debut album
The Rhumb Line offered a quirky
juxtaposition of dizzying orches-
tration flourishes and kitschy,
youthful lyrics ("My bed's too big
for just me" on "Can You Tell"),
Ra Ra Riot's latest album, The
Orchard, has a more mature vibe
complete with quiet moments of
misery.
These mournful undertones are
the product of events surround-
ing the band before recording the
album. In the midst of making its
self-titled EP, drummer John Pike
went missing. Later the band was
given the unfortunate news that
Pike had passed away. Several
weeks later, Ra Ra Riot released a
statement expressing their intent
to continue as a band, and in 2008
gained a new drummer in Gabri-
el Duquette. They soon started
work on The Orchard with The
Rhumb Line producer Ryan Had-
lock (Blonde Redhead, Gossip,
Islands).

Alex O'Laughlin
ruins yet another
CBS enterprise
By KAVI SHEKHARPANDEY
Daily Film Editor
Remember those Cheetos com-
mercials where Chester Cheetah
had a meter to
adjust levels of
cheese? Well, if
Chester were to Hawaii
see the revamp
of the iconic Fie-0
"Hawaii Five- Mondays at
0," he'd crank 10 p.m.
that lever all the CBS
way up to Dan-
gerously Cheesy.
Filled to the brim with shoot-
outs, explosions and bikini-clad
women, "Hawaii Five-O" is the
television equivalent of a Michael
Bay movie - which could trans-
late to either mindless fun or a
torturous experience.
The show follows an elite
law enforcement squad clean-
ing out high-profile criminals
from Hawaii because apparently,
behind all the wind surfing and
luaus, the state is a hotbed of
international terrorism. The team
answers only to the governor
(Jean Smart, "24") who promises
them "full immunity" and "no red
tape," which is just a convenient
plot device to allow characters to
bypass proper police procedures,
letting them shoot first and ask
questions later.
The squad is led by Steve
McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin), a
former Navy SEAL who, in the
show's pilot, puts together the
task force to hunt down the man
who killed his father. McGar-
rett is a veritable G.I. Joe, an
extremely proficient soldier who
is as impassive as an actual action
figure. It all comes down to the
ineptitude of O'Loughlin, who
drags down the show with his
inability to emote or inject any
sort of personality into his char-
acter. O'Loughlin is so awful that
it feels necessary to take a (rel-
evant) tangent to momentarily
raise some hell.

"Look at this guy's smile. It's dangerously cheesy."

What exactly is CBS's obsession
with Alex O'Loughlin? "Hawaii
Five-o" is his fourth collabora-
tion with the network in the past
four years. He was given the lead
role in "Moonlight" and "Three
Rivers," two instantly forgettable
series that lasted 16 and 13 epi-
sodes respectively, and he was the
male lead in crapfest "The Back-
up Plan," released earlier this
year by CBS Films. There's clearly
some sort of talent deal going on
- O'Loughlin is objectively a very
bad actor and seriously limits the
potential of "Hawaii Five-0."
O'Loughlin's miserable perfor-
mance is only accentuated by the
excellence of Scott Caan ("Ocean's
Eleven"), who plays his partner
Danny "Danno" Williams. Caan is
witty and goofy as a divorced dad
who moves out of his New Jersey
comfort zone to Hawaii so he can
be closer to his daughter. Caan is a
magnetic presence, cracking jokes
throughout gunfights and crime
scenes but unearthing his softer
side in the appropriate occasions.
The squad is rounded out by
two fairly flat characters: Chin Ho
Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim, "Lost")
and the show's single significant
female character; Chin Ho's cous-
in Kona (Grace Park, "Battlestar
Galactica"). Chin Ho doesn't do
much besides brandish a shotgun
(though he's sure to develop as
the show progresses) and Kona is
relegated to disgustingly exploit-
ative eye candy - she's shown in
her underwear twice within the
pilot and engages in a catfight in

the second episode which, yes,
ends up with both women fighting
in a pool.
"Hawaii Five-0" fits nicely on
the CBS schedule, among all the
episodic crime procedurals. Yet
instead of mere homicides a la
"CSI," the crime of the week is
larger in scope, involving such
nefarious deeds as human traf-
ficking and the abduction of very
important people. These lead to
some very entertaining action
sequences - quite impressive for
network television - that look
incredible due to ace cinematog-
raphy and well executed direction.
But the action also highlights a
major flaw of the show: There are
no stakes. During the shootouts,
the four main characters may get
nicked or bruised, but as an audi-
ence, we know that they will be
perfectly fine by next week. As
fun as the action sequences are,
there's a significant lack of sus-
pense knowing that our heroes
are not in any danger. Compare
this to "24," where every firefight
generated heart-stopping tension,
as any given character (even Jack
Bauer) could be killed.
"Hawaii Five-O" works as a
turn-off-your-brain, subtext-free
hour of television. And no matter
how much O'Loughlin sucks it up
or how grossly exploitative it is
toward women, there are enough
elements in place to make it a fun
time-pass (if you have time to
pass). Plus, it has the greatest
theme song of all time. Objec-
tively.

between hyperbole and reality.
Still I searched for every possible
reason not to start the discussion,
to battle against the omnipresent
power of the national media hype
machine. It has only been five games
after all. But the last five Heisman
winners' stats through five games
offer little consolation to the doubt-
ers.
Last year, Alabama running back
Mark Ingram had just 487 yards and
six touchdowns through five games.
The year before, Sam Bradford had
accumulated almost 1,700 yards and
18 touchdowns by game five, but
most of that came through the air.
Going back even further, Tim
Tebow, in one of college football's
greatest seasons, accumulated 1,730
total yards (1,297 passing, 433 rush-
ing) and 19 touchdowns by week five
of the 2007 season. And in 2005, if
you can still consider ita Heisman
year, USC running back Reggie Bush
notched 791 yards and eight touch-
downs.

Solid seasons - for someone with
his shoes tied.
But Robinson's numbers tower
over the award's modern winners
through five games of their legend-
ary seasons. His 1,008 yards passing
nearly eclipses 2006 winner Troy
Smith, and Smith rarely ran for any
yards. Robinson's 905 yards on the
ground are closer to Ingram and
Bush's total combined than either
of their separate contributions. And
though itgoes without saying, his
total yardage makes every member
on that list look pedestrian through
five games.
There's only one candidate in the
history of the honor who Denard
looks like through five games. And
it's the most staggering comparison
of all.
Barry Sanders' 1988 season is
arguablythe best of any collegiate
football player in the game's history.
He ran for 2,850yards and tallied 39
touchdowns from all over the field,

Robinson bails out 'D' in close win

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
BLOOMINGTON - Denard
Robinson's explosive speed, a
struggling defense and a final-
minute victory - same old, same
old for the Michigan football team
in its win over Indiana.
There was one slight difference
in this game.
Five-feet-six-inches, to be
accurate. That's the height of
sophomore running back Vincent
Smith.
For the first time all season, the
Wolverines used just one tailback
in a game. It was a far cry from

last week's merry-go-round of
backs against Bowling Green (six
running backs had carries).
Smith rushed nine times for 80
yards, including a 56-yard touch-
down run late in the third quarter
to put Michigan ahead by a touch-
down.
"I'm sure it helped him get into
a bit of rhythm, being out there
every play," senior offensive line-
man Steve Schilling said. "A lot of
times with the run game, they'll
hit one, two, three yards and then
a big one, like he did.
"Denard's been having most of
our big plays so far, but Vincent's

game.
When the team returned from
a timeout, Robinson took the ball,
kept it in his own hands and slipped
around the left side into the end
zone for the game-winning touch-
down with 17 seconds remaining.
It was an ending that seemed
inevitable throughout the game:
whoever had the ball last would
win.
Indiana entered the game with
the Big Ten's top passing attack.
And fifth-year senior quarterback
Ben Chappell played like it, fin-
ishing with 480 yards, setting an
all-time record for passing yards
against Michigan (5-0,1-0 Big Ten).
On the very first drive, Chappell
connected with his three veteran

wide receivers: Tandon Doss, Dam-
arlo Belcher and Terrence Turner.
The Hoosiers (3-1, 0-1) dinked and
dunked their way down the field
throughout the game, taking bits
and pieces here and there.
And it worked against Michi-
gan's defense in the first half. Indi-
ana had three drives that lasted
10-plus plays and 70-plus yards
to tie the game 21-21 at the half,
including a gutsy call at the end of
the half to go for a touchdown with
just enough time for a single play.
While the Hoosiers were din-
king and dunking, Michigan took
full-sized bites out of the Indiana
defense. It started with a 72-yard
touchdown run that Robinson
broke on the Wolverines' second

Michigan rebounded with a 4-2

Penalties derailed the Wolver-

in the first period, the team took six
in the second, including a five-min-

The Wolverines killed off the major
and over a minute of five-on-three,
but midway through the second, the
Lakers finally capitalized.
Almost a minute after senior
center Matt Rust's shorthanded

three quick passes, resulting in a
backdoor goal that left senior goalie

A frustrating draw for Michigan

In adverse conditions,
freshman notches late
game-tying goal
By CAITLIN SMITH

The Michigan women's soccer
team returns from Evanston, Illi-
nois with a tie. But for the Wol-
verines, the stalemate sure felt
like a loss.
North-
western MICHIGAN 1
(1-1-1 NORTHWESTERN 1
Big Ten,
5-4-3 overall) gained an early lead
on their home field after capital-
izing on a scramble in front of the
Wolverines' net. Despite facing
strong winds and a slick field, the
Wolverines (0-1-1, 5-2-3) found the
equalizer and sent the game into
double overtime. But even after
110 minutes of play, neither team
could connect for the win.
"It was disappointing," Michi-
gan coach Greg Ryan said. "I
thought we were really the team
worth the win tonight. North-
western is a very solid team and

it was really a tough game, but
I though we actually created
enough chances to put it away."
Michigan did have its share of
opportunities, led by freshman
forward Nkem Ezurike. Ezurike,
who has already established her-
self as an offensive powerhouse
early in the year, tallied her sixth
goal of the season to tie up the
game in the second half.
Ezurike tied the game up after
collecting the ball deep in the
Wildcat box. After spinning off
the opponent, she defiantly placed
the ball past Northwestern's div-
ing goalkeeper. The freshman
spectacle continued throughout
the snatch, but was dampened, to
put it simply, by bad luck.
The Wolverines managed to
clang two shots off the goal post
during the two sets of extra time,
one of which was followed by two
unsuccessful, rebound opportu-
nities.
Ezurike also netted the appar-
ent game-winner within the final
ten minutes of regulation, but the
goal was not counted due to an
offside call.
"You know, it is (luck)," Ryan
said. "Whether you're in soccer or

on the defensive end of the
field, the Wolverines showed
great discipline with their one-.
on-one matchups. Michigan con-
trolled the ball effectively on the
ground, but it was redshirt soph-
omore goalkeeper Haley Kop-
meyer who kept the game within
reach by making a season-high
eight saves.
"Always out of those eight
(saves), there are one or two
that she has to make," Ryan said.
"And she made it. She made good
decisions in a game that was very

slick and windy. She was focused
on making sure she didn't give up
any rebound, really protecting
the goal well."
In a game that was decorated
with a variety of environmental
elements, Michigan still managed
to play with great focus and inten-
sity. If this style of play continues
throughout the season, the Wol-
verines could arise as a dominant
force in the Big Ten - as long as
they leave the bad luck behind.
Michigan continues its confer-
ence play next Saturday at home
against Michigan State, contrib-
uting to a sports weekend marked
by the intrastate rivalry against
the green and white.

Redshirt junior goalkeeper
Chris Blais knew that Sunday's
contest _
against PENN STATE 1
Penn MICHIGAN 2
State
would be a word-fought battle
from the start. But he couldn't
have predicted that a diving save
during a last-ditch scrambleby the
Nittany Lions in the final seconds
of the game would seal the 2-1 win
at the the U-M Soccer Complex.
Looking at this Big Ten match-
up in advance, many Wolverine
fans would have predicted a game
driven by revenge - as Penn State
eliminated the Wolverines last sea-
son during conference tournament
play. But the Michigan men's soc-
cer teamhad an alternative agenda.
"Since they got us out of the Big
Ten Tournament last year, we defi-
nitely talked about it," Blais said
after the game. "But again, that's
last year, a different team. That
game hurt, we'll all remember it
- but this is now. This game is all
that matters."
The Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten,
C-2-3 overall) played true to this
mantra, gaining an early lead as
freshman forward Soony Saad set
up his brother, sophomore mid-
fielder Hamoody Saad, for a goal.
The Saad brothers have been a
spectacle this season, together
tallying 10 goals and managing to
score in six of Michigan's 10 games.
Although the Wolverines
seemed to have the game at their
feet, they struggled to capital-
ize on several close offensive
attempts. Unable to secure a
healthy lead, Michigan went into
the second half with its advantage

in jeopardy.
Penn State (0-2-0, 6-3-0) was
awarded a controversial penalty
kick just minutes after the start-
ing whistle. The Nittany Lions
took advantage of this, netting the
equalizer.
At this point, emotions began to
show and the game's tempo picked
up, Aggression surfaced, and by
the end of the game the two teams
had racked up a total of 41 fouls
and seven yellow cards.
"That's just the Big Ten sea-
son for you," Blais said. "Guys are
sliding, there are stupid fouls, and
there is a lot of stuff after the play.
People's feet are constantly get-
ting stepped on, but that's justpart
of Big Ten soccer and you've got to
deal with it."
Despite the roughhousing,
Michigan managed to take final
control of the match. With 15
minutes left in regulation, senior
defender Chase Tennant lofted
the ball over the defense to senior
forward Justin Meram. Meram
chased the ball down and thread-
ed it through the legs of Penn State
goalkeeper Warren Gross.
"Whenever a player scores a
goal, I think the whole world goes
blank and they just run and cel-
ebrate," Michigan coach Steve
Burns said. "That's the great thing
about our sport. The same thing
holds true for a coach but you only
celebrate for a second or two and
then you quickly have to look at any
adjustments you need to make."
Sitting on a one-goal lead, the
Wolverines focused their efforts
on keeping Penn State out of scor-
ing position for the final 14 min-
utes of the game. No one wanted
to chance another Nittany Lion
comeback. The Michigan defense,
which fended off 14 shots during
the course of the match, showed
its strength is the final seconds of
the contest.
Penn State was awarded a cor-
ner kick with 20 seconds remain-
ing and put together an assault to
try to send the game into overtime.
The ball was delivered deep inside
Michigan's six-yard box and wild-
ly bounced around, hitting limbs
on both teams. During the scram-
ble, Blais made the game-winning
save, divingtoblock aballthat was
inches away from the goalline.
"This is a signature win for our
season," Burns said. "And I think
whenever a win like that happens
in a season, you'll see that the
team willgain confidence and gain
momentum and will really startto
roll. And that is what we expect to
see from our guys."

BLOOMINGTON - After
Michigan's 42-35 victory over
Indiana - a win that yielded the
second-most
total yards in NOTEBOOK
Michigan's his-
tory - Hoosier quarterback Ben
Chappellwas exhausted.
And rightfully so. The Big Ten's
passing leader had torched the
Wolverines' secondary for 480
yards on 45-of-64 passing -all
threeofwhich were Indiana school
records.
But the record-setting perfor-
mance maysaymore for the young,
struggling Michigan secondary
than it does for Chappell.
"They've got a fifth-year senior
quarterback and some veteran
wideouts that did a nice job and
made some nice catches," Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said

play of the game.
Then, Robinson completed a
32-yard touchdown pass to red-
shirt sophomore wide receiver
Roy Roundtree on the next
drive.
But the act continued.
On the third drive, Roundtree
caught another pass and sprint-
ed down to the two-yard line for
a 74-yard completion.
Robinson and the offense
scored touchdowns of 72, 70, 56
and 32 yards - and four of Mich-
igan's six touchdown drives last-
ed less than a minute.

absolutely dominating every
single player he faced.
But through five games, Rob-
inson has been, well, better.
Granted, he has 100 fewer
rush yards and two fewer touch-
downs, but that fails to account
for any of Robinson's 1,008 pass
yards. Or the fact that he's a
freaking quarterback.
It's safe to say that no one
knows how to deal with Ron-

after the game. "A few times it was
a true freshman getting worked on
a little bit. Other than a few times
that they went after the rookies, I
have to watch the film to see what
happened."
Chappell's favorite target on
Saturday, junior Tandon Doss,
played a huge part in harassing the
Wolverines' young corners, grab-
bing 15 receptions for 221 yards
- both career highs. His counter-
part on the other side of the field,
junior Damarlo Belcher, also had
his way, notching 91 yards and a
second quarter touchdown that
tied the game going into the half.
"They have a lot of young guys
in their secondary," Doss said. "So
we exposed them a lot ... Obviously
they won, but they left the middle
of the field open a lot."
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
has talked abouthis youngcorners'
development, insisting that guys
like freshmen Terrence Talbott,
three-and-out or three-and-
touchdown for most of the
game," fifth-year senior left
guard Steve Schilling said after
the game. "If we're scoring fast,
we need to do it every time."
That quick scoring left the
defense on the field to face Chap-
pell and the Hoosier offense for
a long time.
The 568 yards Michigan
allowed is the third-most in
school history.
"The stats are interesting,
huh?" Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez remarked. "Thirty-
five first downs for them to 15
for us. They ran 98 plays to 45
for us. I don't like seeing that."
In the second half, the Wol-
verines started to stand their
ground, forcing Indiana to punt
tnson's astronomical stats or
domination of his opponents. A
significantly more difficult slate
lies ahead in Big Ten season that
will absolutely separate the con-
tenders from the pretenders.
But no one can stop Denard
Robinson, and Rich Rodriguez
sure won't stop using him
because he as well as anybody
knows they're going nowhere
without him. He is indeed col-
lege football's most valued
player.
How often do you hear that
about someone who's started
just five games?

Courtney Avery, Cullen Christian
and Carvin Johnson would get
playing time in Big Ten season.
But many of those young guys
struggled on Saturday. So did
more established veterans in the
secondary like senior James Rog-
ers and solhomore J.T. Floyd,
allowing receivers like Doss and
Belcher to have too much of a
pocket on man-to-man coverage.
Then, when the Hoosiers' wide-
outs cut across the middle of the
field, the Michigan's corners were
often too far behind, resulting in
an 11-of-19 mark ton third downs
for Indiana.
"I'm not concerned," second-
ary coach Tony Gibson said. "It's
a lot easier to fix it when you win.
I thought our kids, you know, we
didn't have many stops but we
came up big when we had to a few
times in the second half. We just
have a lot of work to do."

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN

MAIZE GAUGE

The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box-score. The Spread-o-Meter measures the success of quarterbacks, the Rod-o-Meter
judges how emotional (positive or negative) Rich Rodriguez was following the game and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

SPREAD-O-METER

Denards

On Saturday against Inidiana, sophomore Denard Rob-
inson became the first quarterback in college football
history to run for 200 yards and pass for 200 yards in
two regular-season games in a college career. The best
part? He'll have plenty of opportunities to do it again.

ROD-O-METER
2 After the game, Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
was all business - again. It almost defeats the
Rich Rods purpose of having a Rod-O-Meter when Michigan
wins every week. Rodriguez, once again, didn't get
too high on the offense or too low on the defense.

HYPE-O-METER
2 Sellout? Indiana claimed to sell out this game
but the stands told a different story. The Indi-
g ana tailgate scene must be something else, as the
Big Houses stands were about two-thirds full until the end of
the first quarter, when they finally filled up.


LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

PLAY OF THE GAME

REDSHIRT JUNIOR WIDE RECEIVER JUNIOR HEMINGWAY
With about a minute left, Hemingway made what
is undoubtedly the biggest catch of his collegiate
career. See 'Play of the Game' to see exactly
how the play went down. But that wasn't all -
he had another long score right after halftime.
Teammates tease the wideout for looking more
like a tight end, and he almost got caught at
the goal line but eluded the Hoosier defenders
for the score. Hemingway prompted his coach
to say after the game that the wide receiver
may have "the best ball skills on the team."

DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR GREG ROBINSON
After what was almost definitely the worst defensive
performance of the season for Michigan, Greg
Robinson refused to talk to the media. He repeatedly
said "No," when approached and literally scurried
away from reporters outside the stadium. All other
assistants were available, including Tony Gibson.
"I'm happy we won the game, I'm disappointed how
we played at certain times on defense," Gibson said.
Shouldn't coach Robinson be accountable, too? Would
that be so hard? Please stop making coach Rodriguez
answer for you. Until then, you're staying here.

With less than 30 seconds remaining, Michigan called for three ver-

out to Denard Robinson's right. Hemingway ran his route down the
field and Robinson threw the ball up for grabs, but behind Hemingway.
So Hemingway adjusted and jumped to catch the ball, then fell down to
the four-yard line to complete the 42-yard pass. The Wolverines scored
the game-winning touchdown on the next play.
