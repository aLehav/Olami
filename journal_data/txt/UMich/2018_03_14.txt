Anthony, an LSA junior at 

the University of Michigan, 
said he learned to shoot 
when he was 8 years old. 
His grandfather, a military 
veteran, taught him how to do 
it well and how to do it safely. 
He mainly uses guns for 
hunting and target shooting, 
and owns several different 
types of rifles, all of which he 
keeps in a locked safe.

Anthony, who asked to 

remain anonymous for fear 
of 
student 
repercussions, 

said 
he’s 
noticed 
some 

common misunderstandings 
about guns — and posed 

counterarguments 
often 

raised by gun owners. 

“That 
owning 
guns 
is 

‘dangerous,’ I’ve heard that 
one a lot,” he said. “They’re 
not dangerous to own, it’s 
people 
who 
lack 
proper 

knowledge and care.”

Anthony, 
who 
has 
had 

official training in gun safety 
and taken hunters’ safety 
courses, said he’s also seen 
people “fearing a gun based 
on how it looks,” citing recent 
calls to ban AR-15 rifles.

“People just need to have 

knowledge on guns and do 
their due diligence on the 
issue because most things 
they are told around the 
issue is false, but they have 

According to a recent study 

of demographics within the 
Ann Arbor Police Department, 
the demographics of the city’s 
police force do not match those 
of the Ann Arbor community. 
In a city that is 69 percent 
white according to a 2010 
census, 
a 
surveyconducted 

earlier this year shows the 
AAPD is 87 percent white or 
Caucasian.

Several members of the 

AAPD 
explained 
the 
lack 

of 
diversity 
within 
the 

department seems to be the 
result of an even greater lack 
of diversity within the pool 
of graduates from the police 
academy. 
Lieutenant 
Mike 

Scherba said in the state of 
Michigan, about 97 percent 
of the academy graduates are 
white males.

“What we found traditionally 

is that those coming out of the 
police academy in this area are 
white males and the tentative 
pool for the police department 
is then obviously primarily 
white males,” Scherba said. “As 
a result, we had to then look 
and think: ‘How do we better 
represent the diversity within 
our city?’”

A 
need 
for 
diversity 

representative 
of 
the 
Ann 

Arbor populace has also been 
emphasized 
due 
to 
recent 

racially-charged incidents in 
AAPD, such as the shooting of 

Aura Rosser in 2014 and the 
violent arrest of high school 
student 
Ciaeem 
Slaton 
in 

September, leading Ann Arbor 
citizens to call for increased 
transparency in the AAPD 
as well as a police review 
board. At an October rally in 
support of Slaton, Ann Arbor 
resident DaQuann Harrison 
said the incidents involving 
Slaton and Rosser –– both 
Black residents of the city –– 
were representative of a larger 
problem that existed in Ann 
Arbor as well as the rest of the 
country.

“(Ciaeem) is one of many 

youth of color who are targeted 

by police in here,” he said. “His 
situation is also one of many 
that has historically appeared 
here in Ann Arbor.” 

Members 
of 
minority 

communities 
at 
the 

University of Michigan as 
well, 
including 
Rackham 

student 
Javier 
Solorzano 

Parada, have experienced a 
lack of communication and 
understanding 
with 
AAPD 

that they feel is not on par 
with the relationship between 
the police and white student 
communities. When students 
were arrested at a tailgate 
hosted by Solorzano Parada’s 
former fraternity, which is 

predominantly 
Latino, 
he 

said 
officers 
provided 
no 

explanation.

“Communication is key with 

communities of color, and you 
need to tell us it’s not about race 
but safety, or size or whatever 
reason you may have,” he said. 
“And if I’m scared after all 
these years here, what must it 
be like for an undergraduate 
student? Or a first-generation 
student? We shouldn’t have 
to be afraid of the police. We 
shouldn’t have to live in fear.”

To combat the discrepancy 

between 
the 
community 

demographics and the lack 

Students know it is almost

of “trolling” or “fake news,” 
terms 
that

2016

The University of Michigan

More than 100 people gathered 

inside Rackham Auditorium at the 
University of Michigan Tuesday 
afternoon to explore the benefits 
of digital technologies in helping 
depression on college campuses 

nationwide.

This discussion is just one of 

many events taking place during 
The 
Depression

College 

Campuses Conference held March 
13 through 14. The conference, 
which has been held annually 
for 16 years, includes a series of 
workshops, 
panel 
discussions 

and sessions that pertain to 

mental health awareness. These 
sessions include information on 
how to provide safe spaces for 
LGBTQ students, how to promote 
wellness on campus and how to 
aid international student mental 
health. There is a multitude of 
sessions specific to every kind of 
individual and demographic.

A campus task force last year 

found 96 percent of student 
respondents feel mental health 
should be accommodated on a 
college campus, but 74 percent do 
not feel comfortable addressing 
their concerns with faculty.

Tom Insel, co-founder and 

president of Mindstrong Health, 
kicked off the two-day conference.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 14, 2018


of diversity within the AAPD, 
the department has responded 
by seeking to recruit a wider 
pool of candidates through 
extending 
their 
recruiting 

radius. 
Sergeant 
Jaime 

Crawford from the recruiting 
and hiring unit of the AAPD 
explained the department is 
actively looking for candidates 
from all over Michigan.

“We 
are 
really 
trying 

to 
broaden 
where 
we 
are 

recruiting from and the type 
of events we are attending,” 
Crawford said. “In the past, it 
was easier to recruit inasmuch 
as we didn’t have to do much 
because people were seeking 
out law enforcement as a career, 
and now that has changed so we 
are really trying to attend events 

at universities and we are going 
into more urban areas.”

Crawford said AAPD has 

begun 
recruiting 
at 
many 

colleges throughout the state, 
attending career fairs at the 
University of Detroit Mercy, 
Wayne State University, Ferris 
State 
University, 
Michigan 

State 
University 
and 
Mott 

Community College. Recruiters 
like Crawford seek to identify 
good candidates — even those 
who might not be ready to 
apply for several years — in 
order to develop awareness of 
opportunities within AAPD.

“We want to expose them 

to what the Ann Arbor Police 
Department 
is 
all 
about,” 

Crawford said. “We are highly 
regarded within the state and 
among other police departments 
so we really want to pull them 
in early and let them know what 
we have to offer.”

Part of how AAPD goes 

about recruiting is through 
maintaining diversity within 
the recruiting staff.

“We try to have diversity in 

our recruiters,” Crawford said. 
“Just so that the representatives 
we have from the Ann Arbor 
Police 
Department 
are 

approachable and can answer 
any questions or concerns that 
potential 
candidates 
might 

have. As a female, I get a lot of 
questions from females that are 
curious to know what it’s like in 
this field.”

Crawford went on to explain 

that while it is obviously a 
male-dominated environment, 
she has been afforded every 
opportunity.

“My experience with Ann 

Arbor has been phenomenal,” 
Crawford said.

Alongside pursuing potential 

candidates 
at 
universities, 

AAPD has also initiated a 
sponsorship 
program 
as 

another mode of promoting 
diversity. The program allows 
the city to assume the cost of 
the candidate attending the 
academy with the promise 
that when they graduate, they 
become an officer in AAPD. 
This 
has 
been 
helpful 
as 

Crawford said the academy 
itself can be a roadblock for 
potential candidates. It can be 
difficult for some to attend the 
academy due to the cost, which 
is about $7,000, combined with 
the fact students in the academy 
don’t have time to work during 
the training process.

Scherba cited two recent 

instances where the sponsor 
program 
has 
helped 
bring 

diversity into the force

“In our most recent process 

we identified one non-white 
male we intend to sponsor,” 
Scherba said. “Our most recent 
hire group included a female 
who we sponsored.”

While the change in numbers 

from 2014 to 2016 appeared 
bleak 
for 
the 
department, 

hiring solely white officers 

during that period. Crawford 
said diversity has since picked 
up in the hiring process.

“We just hired one brand 

new officer, non-white male, 
and we have another that is 
in the process right now,” 
Crawford said. “We just hired 
another female as well.”

The resurgence in diversity 

in the hiring process is timely 
considering the AAPD seems 
to be losing diversity through 
the 
retirement 
of 
several 

members. However, Scherba 
says the process of creating 
more 
diversity 
within 
the 

department is a gradual process 
with long-term effects.

“We are kind of in the more 

beginning 
stages 
of 
really 

starting to see the fruits of our 
effort,” Scherba said. “We are 
finally beginning to see some 
positive results. Getting more 
candidates is increasing our 
applicant pool so it’s only going 
to result in a better department 
for our community.”

The AAPD is in a state of 

transition, due to the transfer 
of AAPD Police Chief Jim 
Baird, 
who 
is 
relocating 

to 
Breckenridge, 
Colo. 

Meanwhile, the city is still in 
the process of determining his 
successor. While some may 
question how the transition 
between police chiefs may 
affect the AAPD’s momentum 
in pursuing diversity within the 
force, the City Administrator 
Howard Lazarus said they will 
undoubtedly select a chief who 
will be supportive of this goal.

“As we recruit a new police 

chief, we will recruit someone 
who reflects the values of Ann 
Arbor and city government,” 
Lazarus said. “We are an 
inclusive society that meets in 
an inclusive community, and 
we try to reflect that in all of 
our commissions. So whoever 
we recruit as the police chief 
will reflect those values.”

On the surface, it would appear 

rapper Iggy Azalea and Danny 
Sheridan, University of Michigan 
Business senior, don’t have a 
lot in common. Azalea grew up 
on Azalea Street in Australia. 
Sheridan grew up on Woodside 
Lane in Ohio. However, both 
Azalea and Sheridan have shaped 
a brand around their hometown 
street name.

Sheridan founded Woodside 

Distributors as a high school 
freshman. Like any successful 
entrepreneur, 
Sheridan 
began 

his business in his childhood 
bedroom. He saw an opportunity 
within the video game market for 
Xbox Live, a gaming membership 
sold as a gift card which allows 
virtual gameplay between friends. 

Just like the popular Webkinz 

World membership of the early 
2000s, XBox Live memberships 
became highly coveted. Sheridan 
capitalized 
on 
this 
demand 

and developed a pricing model 
that allowed him to resell the 
memberships for profit.

The early days of Woodside 

Distributors 
resemble 
the 

narrative 
of 
an 
archetype 

technology icon. Sheridan quit 
lacrosse and football to focus his 
efforts on expanding his business. 
He spent his free time modeling 
profits with Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheets 
and 
contacting 

suppliers. 
He 
even 
recruited 

“the smartest kid in AP Physics,” 
University alum Alex Glassman, 
to lend expertise in data analytics. 
Instead of venture capitalists, 
his investors were bar mitzvah 
guests.

“So I decided to use $6,000 of 

my bar mitzvah money, which 
was actually my funding source,” 
Sheridan told Click on Detroit. “I 
am glad that my parents didn’t say 
no because at the time I wasn’t in 
control of the funds. They actually 
transferred all of it over and said, 
‘It’s your life,’ which was nice to a 
freshman in high school. I really 
appreciated it.”

By his senior year of high 

school, Woodside Distributors 
revenue reached the $2 million 
milestone. One can only wonder 
what his Common Application 
essay was about.

When Sheridan left Woodside 

Lane, 
he 
took 
Woodside 

Distributors with him. Sheridan 
and Glassman headed for Ann 
Arbor with big goals for the 
company. Over the course of their 
four years at the University, they 
have recruited classmates, spent 
a summer working in a rented 

Business School classroom with a 
team of 12 students, expanded to 
sell over 200 products and topped 
$3.5 million in revenue.

Perhaps most surprising is 

how the nimble architecture 
of 
Woodside 
Distributors 

has allowed for Sheridan and 
Glassman to not sacrifice the 
typical college experience.

“We get to sit behind a 

computer, paying no full-time 
salaries, paying no rent,” Sheridan 
said. “Right now, it’s making 
money and I’m putting in about 
seven to 10 hours a week. The 
ideas are based off a four-hour 
workweek.”

After graduating from the 

Business School in May, Sheridan 
will not be returning to Woodside 
Lane. Rather, he is headed to 
Seattle, where he has accepted 
a job offer from Amazon as a 
product manager.

Prosecutor prepares to take se-

rial rape case to trial 

For the past 2 1/2 years, Ann 

Arbor citizens have had to live 
with the fear of possibly becoming 
the next victim of a serial rapist - a 
criminal who brutally beats his vic-
tims into unconsciousness and then 
rapes them. The viciousness of his 
attacks left one woman dead and 
four others emotionally scarred.

Then on Christmas Day, an alert 

cab driver gave Ann Arbor police 
a gift in the form of a tip that led 
to the arrest of a suspect. Ervin 
Dewain Mitchell Jr., 33, now stands 
accused of being the serial rapist. 
If he is convicted, many concerned 
members of the community will 
finally have peace of mind.

Before the arrest, the Ann Arbor 

police, who questioned nearly 800 
possible suspects, seemed power-
less to stem the series of sexual 
assaults occurring on the city’s 
west side.

Mitchell was already in police 

custody at the Washtenaw County 
Jail on $50,000 bond awaiting an 

April 3 trial before Judge Don-
ald Shelton for an assault and 
attempted Christmas Eve purse- 
snatching of a 34- year-old Ann Ar-
bor woman. If convicted on those 
charges, he faces up to 15 years in 
prison. He was denied bond last 
week when he was charged with 
four counts of first-degree criminal 
sexual conduct and one count of 
first-degree murder.

“First-degree murder in Michi-

gan carries a mandatory sentence 
of life in prison without parole,” 
said Washtenaw County Prosecu-
tor Brian Mackie, the attorney 
handling both of Mitchell’s trials. 
“Criminal sexual conduct in the 
first degree carries any term of 
years - up to life.”

Mitchell remained unemotional 

as he pleaded not guilty before 14-A 
District Court Magistrate George 
Parker. The arraignment came after 
months of public speculation and 
one of the most intensive manhunts 
in the police department’s history.

Before the arraignment, while 

his client sat in jail unable to meet 
his bond, Washtenaw County As-
sistant Public Defender Lankford 

accused the prosecution of stalling 
and not being able to meet their 
burden of proof.

“If the evidence the prosecution 

has is that good, why haven’t they 
charged him?” Lankford asked. “If 
you can’t charge him, you definitely

can’t convict him.”
It was less than three months 

ago that police arrested Mitchell 
for allegedly punching a 34-year-
old Ann Arbor woman in the 1800 
block of Dexter Avenue and at-
tempting to take her purse.

Amid the glare of TV camera 

lights and a swarm of reporters, 
Mitchell smiled at his arraignment 
Dec. 27 on those charges before 
14-A District Court Magistrate A. 
Thomas Truesdell. “You all are 
going to be seeing a lot of me,” 
Mitchell said as he was escorted 
back to his jail cell in handcuffs and 
leg shackles.

Mitchell’s words were prophetic 

indeed.

LSA sophomore Emily Levy discusses her personal struggles with mental illness at SpeakABLE, to spread awareness for mental illness and 
disabilities at the Gallery in Hatcher Tuesday. 

SPECIAL PRESENTATION
STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENTS: UCLA DEPRESSION 
GRAND CHALLENGE & RESILIENCE PEER NETWORK
SPEAKER: ELIZABETH GONG-GUY, PHD

Wednesday, March 14, 3:00 - 4:00 p.m.
Rackham Auditorium

The steady rise in mental health service offerings has continued to exert pressure on CAPS services 
campus-wide. In this talk, Dr. Elizableth Gong-Guy of UCLA’s Resilience Peer Network will address how 
strategic engagements have helped train and engage students to support the delivery of robust evidence-
based internet cognitive behavioral therapy for students screened for mild-to-moderate depression and 
anxiety. Dr. Gong-Guy will provide a preliminary overview of our findings, and describes our successes in 
bringing a scalable screening, early intervention, treatment, and resilience-building program embedded in 
research to our students.

This special presentation is part of the U-M Depression on College Campuses Conference, 
and is free and open to the public. For more information about the overall conference:

emphasized 
how 

prevalent depression is on college 
campuses, 
especially 
within 

the larger microcosm of ever-
evolving university life.

“We are constantly trying to 

figure out what kind of world we’re 
living in,” he said. “Our ever-
changing 
political, 
economic, 

scientific and cultural society 
has an influence on the kind of 
problem we’re trying to solve. 
How do you address depression? 
Or school violence? Students these 
days are claiming to be from the 
‘school shooting generation.’ New 
tariffs may produce profounding 
change within economic society. 
Basically, there is a changing 
ecosystem of campus life.”

14 months ago, the World 

Health Organization declared the 
number one cause of disability 
for medical illness in the world 
is clinical depression. Moreover, 
according 
to 
a 
2013 
survey 

conducted 
by 
the 
American 

Psychological Association about 
a third of college students have 
experienced depression within 
the past year and had difficulty 
functioning because of it.

“Students 
within 
the 
21st 

century come to college with 
more issues,” Insel said. “About 
30 percent of kids have been 
medicated since middle school. 
It seems that students are more 
willing to seek help, to talk about 

issues, and have seemed to reduce 
the stigma surrounding mental 
health.”

However, Insel warned though 

we have progressed by means of 
talking about mental health, we 
may have progressed at such a fast 
rate we cannot seem to combat 
mental health through services at 
quite the same pace.

“But while all of this is 

changing, supply has not kept up 
with demand,” he said. “Only one-
half of counseling centers have 
any source of accreditation, and 
only 13 percent have a full-time 
person available for students. 
Thirty-one percent of campuses 
essentially 
have 
no 
services 

whatsoever.”

Many believe the problem to 

be an increasing disconnection 
within society due to an increased 
connectivity 
through 
social 

media and technology. College 
students are the “iGen,” the 
first generation to grow up on 
smartphones. Adolescents have 
lower rates of teen pregnancy 
and 
auto-accidents. 
However, 

they also have lower rates of 
possession of driver’s licenses. 
All we need to do if we want to 
connect to our peers is just merely 
sit in our bedroom.

“It most certainly affects how 

people interact face to face,” Insel 
said. “Kids no longer know how 
to interact; the shock they have 
when they leave home and end 
up in the dormitory environment 
or they actually have to live with 
somebody who is not just an 
avatar or a virtual friend.”

no prior knowledge to tell the 
difference,” he said.

Anthony is one of the 28.8 

percent of Michigan residents 
who own a gun — but his anti-
control views are being called 
into question in the wake of 
the Parkland shooting, one of 
the worst mass shootings in 
the country’s history. Now, 
as students across Michigan 
prepare to walk out of class 
Wednesday in remembrance 
of the Parkland victims, state 
lawmakers 
are 
considering 

two gun control measures. One 
would arm certain teachers 
and the other would allow 
authorities to confiscate guns 
from 
people 
who 
exhibit 

symptoms of mental illness.

State Rep. Jim Runestad, 

R-Waterford, 
is 
drafting 

legislation that would permit 
school 
districts 
to 
give 

specially-trained 
teachers 

access 
to 
guns 
stored 
in 

locked, undisclosed locations. 
President Trump has recently 
endorsed the idea of arming 
teachers.

In a statement, Runestad 

said keeping children safe in 
school means having “adequate 
defenses.”

“Children 
are 
vulnerable 

targets in our schools and 
school shootings will not be 
stopped until our schools are 
secure,” Runestad said. “By the 
time police arrive it is usually 
too late. It’s time to develop 
model protocols for the nation 

here in Michigan, whereby 
specially trained staff who 
volunteer will be able to access 
a secured firearm in event of an 
emergency.”

Under 
Runestad’s 
bill, 

volunteers would receive 80 
hours of training on gun use, 
gun safety and de-escalation 
techniques, 
as 
well 
as 

instruction on how to respond 
to an active shooter. Opening 
the 
compartments 
housing 

the guns would require the 
thumbprint of an approved 
school employee.

Public 
Policy 
junior 

Kellie Lounds, chair of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said she disagreed 
with the idea that arming 
teachers would help combat 
gun violence.

“The solution to the epidemic 

of gun violence that our country 
is facing is not to add more 
guns to the equation,” she said. 
“By arming teachers, we would 
be putting an undue burden 
on our already overexerted 
and underpaid educators and 
making the classroom more 
dangerous than before.”

The second measure gaining 

traction 
in 
Lansing 
would 

establish a procedure for taking 
guns away from individuals that 
a judge deems to be a legitimate 
threat. Gov. Rick Snyder, R, has 
expressed support for so-called 
“red flag” legislation, a position 
that puts him at odds with 
some of his fellow Republicans, 
who reference concerns about 
possible 
violations 
of 
due 

process.

Lounds highlighted the need 

to get individuals with mental 

illness treatment, rather than 
focusing only on the role they 
play in mass shootings.

“Mental illness, while not 

the main cause of gun violence, 
is 
something 
our 
country 

should be talking more about,” 
she 
said. 
“People 
dealing 

with mental illness have been 
institutionally 
neglected 

continuously 
and 
should 

receive proper attention all the 
time, not just when politicians 
want to use them as an excuse 
to not do anything about gun 
violence. If we had more strict 
gun laws, these individuals 
wouldn’t have access to guns in 
the first place, and so we can’t 

continue to use mental illness 
as a deflection.”

At 
POLITICO’s 
Eighth 

Annual 
State 
Solutions 

Conference 
in 
Washington, 

D.C. in February, Snyder said 
it’s “worth looking at” red flag 
laws, commenting, “We need to 
have a thoughtful dialogue.”

Lounds 
said 
the 
state 

government 
and 
federal 

government 
are 
“severely 

lacking” 
in 
legislation 
that 

would be effective in decreasing 
gun violence.

“From our perspective, one 

facet of ideal gun regulation 
would be the banning of semi-
automatic 
and 
automatic 

weapons; guns meant largely 
for military activity have no 
place in domestic life,” she 
said. “We should also have 
universal background checks 
for 
individuals 
wishing 
to 

purchase a firearm as well as 
banning the purchase of bump 
stocks. Finally, as some states 
and retailers are starting to do, 
the minimum age to purchase a 
firearm should be raised.”

The 
University’s 
chapter 

of College Republicans did 
not respond to request for 
comment.

After 
the 
shooting 
at 

Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 

High School in Parkland, Fla., 

major retailers including Dick’s 
Sporting Goods and Walmart 
raised the minimum age to 
purchase a gun at their stores 
to 21. A Michigan teen recently 
filed a lawsuit against Dick’s 
Sporting Goods after the chain 
refused to sell him a firearm 
at its store in Troy. The teen 
is suing on the grounds of age 
discrimination.

Anthony disagreed with the 

stores’ decision to raise the 
minimum age to buy a gun. 

productive, 
which 
is 
the 

principal motivation for the 
center.

“The principal avenue to 

improve social media in my 
mind was to update the quality 
of public discourse so that it 
isn’t as corrosive and divisive 
as it has become,” Finholt 
said. “We’ve known, for over 
25 years in some cases, a 
number of simple strategies 
that can be applied to make 
online 
conversations 
more 

sociable and less antagonistic, 
and it’s just a question of 
promoting those strategies and 
compelling the social media 
platform to adopt them.”

University 
alum 
Garlin 

Gilchrist, executive director 
of 
the 
program, 
intends 

to make Finholt’s dream a 
reality. He is from Detroit 
and has worked for Microsoft 
along with serving as one of 
Barack Obama’s social media 
managers during the 2008 
presidential campaign.

Gilchrist 
said 
this 

experience 
showed 
him 

that making the change the 
center is aiming for is not just 
possible, but important.

“It really showed me what 

was possible really early on 
with people using a social 
network 
to 
connect 
with 

others, and it showed me the 
potential for that, and that 
is informing me today when 
I look at how information is 

spreading and all that kind 
of stuff online right now, and 
how it’s going to change in the 
future,” Gilchrist said. “So that 
foundational experience for 
me showed that it is definitely 
possible 
and 
important 
to 

understand 
how 
people 

connect, how they converse, 
and how they engage.”

Gilchrist and the center are 

already working on strategies 
based on algorithms created 
by 
U-M 
researchers 
that 

could be used within the year. 
Gilchrist said the center was a 
response to an important set of 
questions about the way people 
receive information and how 
that is evolving.

“How 
reliable 
is 
that 

information?” 
Gilchrist 

asked. “How healthy is the 
environment? How can we 
measure the level of toxicity or 
personal attack or aggression 
in the conversation, and how 
can we use that research to 
make tools, to make a set of 
recommendations for social 
media makers, social media 
consumers, and for the social 
media platforms themselves 
so we can really make our 
experience online healthy and 
productive?”

The algorithms that have 

already been created are able to 
measure the level of aggression 
or toxicity in a particular 
conversation online, and the 
center 
intends 
on 
sharing 

this information with social 
media platform companies so 
they can make their websites 
friendlier. Finholt mentioned a 
small change made by the New 

York Times that was able to 
positively affect their platform 
and related it to what the 
center was trying to do.

“The New York Times did 

an experiment where instead 
of giving people the option 
of 
thumbs 
up 
or 
thumbs 

down, they gave them a third 
option, 
which 
was 
simply 

‘respect,’” 
Finhold 
said. 

“So you didn’t have to say 
you hated something or you 
loved something; it could be 
something 
that 
you 
didn’t 

agree with, but you liked the 
way the person had said it. And 
that simple intervention made 
a huge difference in the quality 
of the comment thread, and 
tended to extinguish some of 
the trollish behavior that you 
usually see on those comment 
threads.”

Information 
graduate 

student Samuel Carton, who is 
working on machine learning 
for the new center, said he felt 
the hate spread on these sites 
has had a serious impact on the 
issues around politics in the 
U.S.

“Societally, we have this 

huge issue on social media 
where 
informal 
political 

engagement, 
among 
other 

kinds 
of 
interaction, 
is 

really hamstrung by a lack 
of 
stability, 
and 
by 
the 

prevalence of different kinds 
of harassment,” Carton said. 
“It really contributes to some 
of the problems with politics 
in this country, and it really 
drives 
people 
apart 
when 

you can’t have a political 
discussion online without it 

devolving into various forms 
of personal insult and other 
uncivil language.”

Finholt explained how, in 

the scheme of world problems, 
this was one in which an 
average student could make a 
significant impact, which is 
one of the reasons he tackling 
this issue as a responsibility of 
the School of Information.

“One of the key things is to 

recognize that there are many 
problems in the world that it 
can seem like whatever we 
do will make no difference,” 
Finhold said. “Recycling, or 
driving my car less, or taking 
one fewer flight, it may seem 
like that’s sort of a drop in 
the 
bucket. 
But 
with 
the 

behaviors around social media, 
particularly if we were to 
create norms around passing 
around 
information, 
there 

could be within the generation 
a profound normative shift 
where that kind of behavior 
starts to be shunned, kind of 
the way we feel about smoking 
in public or getting in the 
car 
and 
without 
buckling 

the seatbelt. For a large part, 
those 
transformations 
are 

normative and have to do 
with campaigns to fix people’s 
behavior, 
sometimes 
very 

small behaviors.”

Finholt said he believed 

students could have a large 
impact on this issue by doing 
small things.

disability overlap is labels,” 
Schreibman said.

“If there’s a label, it means 

there are enough people who 
experience the same thing 
that a label had to be thought 
of,” they said. “The simple 
existence of a label meant that 
I wasn’t alone.”

Schreibman 
described 

theater as a space for people 
who are unaware of an issue 
to learn about life experiences 
that are much different from 
theirs.

“Theater 
has 
this 

opportunity for people who 
have no idea what’s going to be 
able to go for entertainment, 
but also get really crucial 
information,” they said.

Empathy goes a long way 

for many of these students, 
especially 
when 
it 
comes 

to plans after college, they 
said. 
A 
common 
theme 

among 
presenters 
was 

academic hardships due to 
their disabilities. Many have 
criticized 
the 
University’s 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
plan for overlooking rights and 
access of disabled students, 
faculty and staff.

“The University-wide plan 

only 
mentioned 
disability 

three times,” Art & Design 
sophomore 
Celeste 
Adams 

told the Daily last year. “That 
was appalling and very, very 
offensive.”

According 
to 
LSA 

sophomore Emily Levy, a lack 
of academic accomodations 
can 
affect 
employment 

possibilities, which in turn 
makes certain these struggles 
don’t end after college. 

“Here in a bigger college 

environment, others people’s 
view of you matters more than 
your own view of you,” Levy 
said. “I’ve missed out on many 
opportunities solely to my 
GPA...”

Standing with Planned Parenthood, again

CHARLES CALLIS | OP-ED

STEPHANIE TRIERWEILER | COLUMN

A

t this point, it hardly 
feels like a headline 
since 
it 
happens 
so 

cyclically: 
Republicans 
are 

once again trying to defund 
Planned Parenthood, the largest 
provider of reproductive health 
care and sex education in the 
United States.

Last 
Thursday, 
Politico 

reported 
that 
after 
nearly 

coming to an agreement on 
funding 
levels 
with 
House 

Democrats, House Republicans 
“reneged on women’s health 
issues” during a discussion on 
the annual health spending bill 
for 2018. They are demanding 
several policies that threaten 
health 
care, 
including 

cutting off federal funding to 
Planned Parenthood as well 
as eliminating a federal family 
planning program. This comes 
on heels of President Trump’s 
administration 
slashing 

funding for the Teen Pregnancy 
Prevention Program.

Articles revolving around 

the 
bill 
trickled 
into 
my 

newsfeed at the end of last 
week, quietly juxtaposed with 
the massive waves of pride, 
conversation 
and 
activity 

sweeping across the internet 
for International Women’s Day. 
Hearing news of this attack on 
women’s freedoms feels like 
a stinging reminder of just 
how far we still have to go. 
Despite our progress and sense 
of empowerment in so many 
spaces, women’s autonomy and 
lives continue to be at stake.

Make 
no 
mistake: 
If 

attempts to defund Planned 
Parenthood come to fruition, 
people will suffer, particularly 
women, 
people 
of 
color, 

communities 
of 
lower 

socioeconomic status and rural 
communities with geographic 
barriers 
to 
health 
care. 

National Public Radio explains 
that 
Planned 
Parenthood’s 

federal funding comes from 
Medicaid reimbursements and 
Title X grants. “Defunding” 
the 
organization 
would 

immediately block low-income, 
uninsured people — who depend 
on public health programs — 
from accessing health care. And 
since near half of its revenue 
comes 
from 
government 

funding, Planned Parenthood 
would struggle to maintain its 
centers and services in the same 

capacity.

Planned 
Parenthood 

currently plays a central role in 
providing health care to millions 
of people across the country. 
According 
to 
its 
2016-2017 

annual report, the organization 
saw 2.4 million patients and 
provided 9.5 million services. 
It’s the largest provider of sex 
education in the United States 
and has programs for schools, 
families and professionals. It 
has also conducted research 
in 
reproductive 
health 
for 

over 100 years and provides 
services such as birth control, 
pregnancy testing, emergency 
contraception, abortions and 
referrals, sexually transmitted 
disease 
testing, 
treatment 

and 
vaccines, 
HIV 
testing 

and medication, and LGBTQ 
education.

Additionally, 
Planned 

Parenthood provides critical 
services for people who don’t 
have other options. For example, 
78 percent of its patients have 
incomes at or below 150 percent 
of the federal poverty level. 
According to the Guttmacher 
Institute, 
family 
planning 

health centers like Planned 
Parenthood are the only source 
of care for four in 10 women.

Brianna Jackson, a regional 

patient 
services 
associate 

for 
Planned 
Parenthood 
of 

Michigan 
and 
member 
of 

Planned Parenthood Advocates 
of 
Michigan, 
said 
in 
an 

interview that her interactions 
with patients remind her every 
single day of why she does her 
job: “Just today, I saw a patient 
who was coming in for an IUD 
(intrauterine 
device), 
which 

is usually standard. However, 
she is also homeless and is 
battling an eating disorder, 
depression and anxiety without 
medication. We got her signed 
up 
with 
Medicaid 
so 
she 

could have insurance moving 
forward to find a counselor and 
found her resources to go to a 
shelter if needed. We try and go 
beyond basic health care and 
address the patient and their 
needs as a person.”

Despite 
how 
much 

Planned 
Parenthood 
means 

to women’s health care, rights 
and education, anti-abortion 
activists 
have 
unleashed 

smear campaigns against the 
organization and lawmakers 

have 
relentlessly 
attempted 

to strip it of funding. But this 
crusade is nothing new. Planned 
Parenthood has been routinely 
demonized 
throughout 
its 

history, and its activities have 
been unfairly framed, time 
and time again, as morally 
objectionable.

Even its beginnings are 

rooted 
in 
fighting 
stigma. 

When Margaret Sanger opened 
the first birth control clinic in 
the United States in 1916 and 
distributed birth control as 
well as health information to 
women, she and her staff were 
arrested within two weeks for 
distributing the materials. (This 
clinic was later organized into 
what would become Planned 
Parenthood 
after 
national 

attention was brought to her 
cause). And since the 1970s, 
many state and federal attacks 
have been made to circumvent 
access to abortions and criticize 
Planned Parenthood for being a 
significant provider of abortion 
services.

The common denominator? 

An ideological push that views 
women as second-class citizens. 
Yesterday, it was birth control. 
Today, it’s abortion. Tomorrow, 
it might be something else 
critical to women’s health.

Jackson 
says 
of 
the 

consistent attacks: “At the end 
of the day, we want to offer 
comprehensive women’s health 
care, and some people really 
don’t like that. Because of the 
fact that we offer abortion 
services, because we’re such a 
large organization and because 
we receive federal money, we’re 
being attacked. But we are never 
going to stop abortion services 
just so the attacks stop. Safe 
and legal abortions are part of 
women’s health care and part of 
their rights.”

This new threat of defunding 

is particularly worrisome due 
to the Trump administration 
laying the groundwork to roll 
back protection of abortion 
rights. But we must be resilient, 
we must support women and we 
must fight for organizations that 
do critical work for women. I 
stand with Planned Parenthood.

I

n preparation for writing 
my previous column, “A 21st 
Century Science Course,” I 

interviewed Yuri Popov, a lecturer 
for two sections of Physics 140. 
Originally, I had planned to talk 
to Popov about changes that he 
has seen throughout the years 
while 
teaching 
introductory 

mechanics. However, we ended 
up discussing how U.S. high 
school students compare with 
other students around the world 
in math and science.

The causes and how to address 

these problems are debatable 
topics, but the fact that the U.S. lags 
behind many other industrialized 
countries in math and science 
education is a well-researched 
fact. From data collected by the 
Programme 
for 
International 

Student Assessment and analysis 
conducted by the Pew Research 
Center, the U.S. ranks 38th in 
math and 24th in science out of 71 
countries assessed.

Some people may not see this as 

a huge issue. Though the U.S. is not 
first in either math or science, we 
are not last either. Someone might 
ask why this even matters as most 
people will not end up using what 
they learn in high school chemistry 
class in their everyday lives, and 
they might be right. However, it is 
important to expose every child to 
these topics so that they have every 
opportunity available to them.

Just because someone doesn’t 

use the information every day, it 
does not mean that it is useless 
to teach. There is inherent value 
in teaching every person math 
and science. In these high school 
classes, students focus on logic and 
reasoning, and this will influence 
their cognitive development. We 
owe it to future generations to 
improve the way we teach these 
subjects to give them the best 
opportunity to learn and to grow. 
To do this, we first must recognize 
some of the problems that could be 
causing U.S. students to fall behind.

Popov highlighted what he 

sees as the issues that cause U.S. 
students to fall behind. “The three 
main problems are how schools 
are funded, who decides the 
curriculums and the (excessive) 
amount of choices these young 12 
and 14-year-old kids have when 
signing up for classes,” Popov said.

The property taxes that fund 

schools 
obviously 
offer 
more 

advantages in high-income areas 
as opposed to low-income areas. 
Changing the way that schools 
receive 
funding 
would 
make 

education more equal across the 
board. Deciding what material to 

teach and how to teach it has also 
been a hot issue for many years. 
Popov suggested that professionals 
in each field should be the ones to 
help develop the curriculums so 
that what is truly important is able 
to be discussed in the classroom.

These first two issues I think 

most people understand, and it is 
fairly simple to show that these are 
problems. However, the third is 
slightly more complex, and I myself 
did not think of this as a problem 
initially. In fact, giving kids 
choices and autonomy over their 
own lives is important for their 
development. As pointed out by 
Ned Johnson in an interview with 
Scientific American, children can 
lose motivation if they do not feel 
they are in control of their lives. It 
is great for someone who is a parent 
to encourage their child to explore 
what interests them and allow for 
them to make choices based on 
those interests.

However, as I began to reflect 

on this topic more, I realized that 
there might be some value in more 
standardized requirements and 
less flexibility in a high school 
student’s class schedule. I can’t 
speak for everyone, but at least for 
me, choosing courses in college is 
a confusing and anxiety-riddled 
time. I probably change my mind 
about a certain class four times 
before finally signing up for it, 
and I was the same in high school. 
Though it may help a child’s 
motivation if they are able to make 
their own choices, how do they 
know where their interests lie if 
they end up electing not to take 
what could be an important course 
in high school?

From the Scientific American 

article mentioned earlier, Ned 
Johnson used the example of 
allowing children to choose their 
own personal pastimes. I agree 
these choices should come in the 
form of what extracurricular 
activities 
a 
kid 
wants 
to 

participate in and what to do with 
their Saturday afternoons rather 
than what classes to enroll in. If 
a student has been required to 
spend a few years in high school 
studying and learning a topic, 
they will be more prepared 
to make decisions regarding 
specialization after high school.

During Popov’s years of 

secondary education, he was 
required to take four years of 
physics, four years of math, 
two years of chemistry and two 
years of biology. There was an 
importance placed on math 
and science, and the classes 
filled up his schedule. Four full 

years of physics in high school 
seemed unheard of to me, but 
thinking about it, I came to see 
it as not unreasonable.

To many people, this might 

seem too intense for every student. 
However, I think that if done 
correctly, this type of curriculum 
would be very beneficial. This 
is anecdotal evidence, but many 
people I talk to found physics, or 
any science for that matter, hard 
because it was confusing and 
taught very quickly. In contrast, if 
you had four years to really learn 
it, the subject could be taught at 
a better pace and be much more 
approachable. In doing so, people 
who may not have considered 
a career in a certain field might 
now be more inclined to do so.

It may seem like a radical 

change, but I think science 
literacy is truly just as important 
as English literacy. The more you 
are exposed to true science and 
scientific thinking, the better 
you will be at telling truth from 
fiction. From a study conducted 
by 
the 
National 
Science 

Foundation, from data located 
in Appendix Table 7-11, one can 
see that in 2014, 80 percent of 
college 
graduates 
responded 

that astrology was “not at all 
scientific” 
whereas 
only 
60 

percent of high school graduates 
responded with this answer. I 
believe this is because those who 
go on to college become exposed 
to more scientific thinking and 
therefore are able to distinguish 
real science from pseudoscience. 
Increasing the amount of science 
that is taught in high school 
would help those who do not 
go on to college or those who 
avoid science classes in college, 
to think more critically in their 
everyday lives.

Of course, there could still 

be room for advanced programs, 
classes that go at a slower pace 
and a multitude of electives to fill 
in gaps, but a more standardized 
high school curriculum that 
places 
more 
importance 
on 

science than it currently does is 
needed in the U.S. Implementing 
this is highly dependent on 
solving the issues of funding and 
curriculum creation. However, 
if every student was exposed to 
more science, more people would 
develop better analytical thinking 
skills and more opportunities 
would develop for those who may 
not have been exposed to these 
subjects otherwise.

A case for more science in high school

O

n Feb. 14, 17 children 
and 
educators’ 
lives 

were taken at Marjory 

Stoneman Douglas High School 
in Parkland, Fla. Since then, 
students, educators and millions 
of others have called for policy 
changes to curtail the epidemic 
of mass shootings in America. 
However, here in Ann Arbor, 
Central 
Student 
Government 

campaigns stayed silent.

It is the sad reality in 

America that as students, we are 
an at-risk population for mass 
shootings. Yet, spending much of 
my time holed up in classrooms 
and focusing most of my energy 
on my studies, the threat of an 
active shooter is not normally 
at the forefront of my attention. 
When I find myself thinking 
through what I would do if there 
were a shooter on campus, I 
find myself utterly ill-equipped. 
The Parkland massacre and 
the more than 200 other school 
shootings 
in 
America 
since 

Columbine in 1999 demonstrate 
the threat of an active shooter 
on the University of Michigan’s 
campus is more of a concern 
than I thought previously. Still 
not sold? Ask Central Michigan 
University students how they felt 
on Friday, March 2.

Each CSG election cycle, 

students complain about the 
governing body’s inability to 
impact important issues, like 
minority enrollment, and its 
fixation 
on 
seemingly 
less 

important issues, like Wi-Fi 
on the Diag. This year, the 
campaigns for CSG can address 
an issue of national and local 
importance: school shootings.

Yet, 
since 
the 
Parkland 

shooting, 
the 
MVision, 

momentUM, 
True 
Blue, 

eMpower and aMplify campaigns 
have not even acknowledged 

the tragedy Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School, let alone 
proposed any ideas for gun 
violence prevention. The current 
leadership has done marginally 
better, sharing the March for 
Our Lives Ann Arbor event 
happening later this month, but 
without mention of any steps to 
ensure a tragedy like Parkland 
does not happen on this campus. 
 

Why the deafening silence 

on the issue? Is the University 
of Michigan, one of the most 
prominent public universities 
in the nation, immune to school 
shootings? Of course it isn’t. The 
threat to the lives of students is 
very real. It is the duty of our 
future campus leaders to protect 
our hoMe from gun violence.

In Florida and across the 

country, students have risen 
up. 
They 
organized 
school 

walkouts, 
protests 
and 
the 

March for Our Lives. These 
efforts joined movements like 
Moms Demand Action for Gun 
Sense in America, the Center 
for American Progress, Dick’s 
Sporting 
Goods 
and 
many 

other non-profits, government 
officials 
and 
businesses 
in 

demanding policy change. CSG 
campaigns must join these brave 
students and organizations to 
take a stand for the safety of the 
University’s students.

CSG campaigns can start 

by talking about the issue. 
Incorporate 
student 
safety 

and gun violence prevention 
measures 
into 
campaign 

platforms 
and 
messages. 

Demonstrate 
we, 
as 
at-risk 

students, are taking a stand 
against gun violence. Explore 
preemptive 
measures. 
Arm 

educators 
and 
students, 

not with guns, but with the 
knowledge of what to do in 
the event of a shooting. Then, 

require professors share this 
information with their students 
at the beginning of the semester, 
as they do with campus mental 
health 
resources. 
 
Explore 

advanced infrastructure, such 
as safety-communication apps 
or bulletproof doors, which can 
prevent or mitigate the effects 
of mass shootings. Take a stand, 
as representatives of the student 
body, and lobby University and 
government officials at all levels 
in favor of policies ensuring the 
safety of University students. 

Campaigns should also take 

a stance on policies that do 
not work. Arming professors 
increases the risk of accidents 
in the classroom by allowing 
potentially 
dangerous 
and 

untrained individuals to carry 
weapons in the very classrooms 
we seek to protect. Arming 
educators also perpetuates the 
unrealistic idea of a teacher 
saving the day, demonstrated by 
the armed sheriff deputies hiding 
during the shooting at Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School. 
Armed faculty creates more 
problems than solutions.

If this year’s CSG campaigns 

truly 
seek 
to 
improve 
the 

livelihood of students, let us start 
by ensuring no one is lost to gun 
violence here on campus. To all 
those pursuing a position within 
CSG, the time to talk about this 
issue is now. Take a stand, speak 
out and pursue changes that will 
protect the student body and save 
lives. Take this opportunity to 
give light to and impact an issue 
of local and national importance. 
I would say campaigns can keep 
their thoughts and prayers, but 
it seems like those aren’t on the 
table either.

Mindy Kaling’s ‘Champions’ off to a slow, steady start

A 
carefree 
bachelor’s 
life 
turns upside down when his 
kid is dumped on his doorstep. 
We’ve seen that before, haven’t 
we? “Parenthood” did it. So did 

“Baby Daddy” and the short-lived 
“Grandfathered.” But if anyone 
can take an old trope and give it 
new life, surely it’s Mindy Kaling, 
who 
elevated 
the 
workplace 
sitcom with heart and chutzpah 
on “The Office,” and subverted the 
expectations of romantic comedies 
on “The Mindy Project” just as 
often as she reveled in them.
On 
“Champions” 
— 
her 
charming new NBC comedy with 
“Mindy 
Project” 
co-producer 
Charlie Grandy — Kaling returns 
to TV in a recurring role as 
Cleveland-based 
single 
mom 
Priya Patel, who surprises her 
high school flame Vince (Anders 
Holm, “Workaholics”), a washed-
up gym owner in Brooklyn, with 
their 
flamboyant 
15-year-old 
son Michael (J.J. Totah, “Glee”). 
Michael needs a place to live in the 
city so he can attend a prestigious 
performing arts high school, and 
Vince is Priya’s last resort. 
Holm did excellent work on 
“The Mindy Project” as pastor-
turned-DJ-turned-shoe 
mogul 

Casey, but as Vince, he’s woefully 
underwritten and lacking the 
depth or charisma of anyone he 
shares scenes with, leaving him 
in the awkward position of being 
a supporting character on his 
own show. He’s helped out a bit 
by the delightful Andy Favreau 
(“The Mick”) as Vince’s brother 
Matthew, who manages to muster 
enough energy for the both of 
them.
The breakout star here is J.J. 
Totah as Michael. An updated 
version of “Ugly Betty”’s Justin 
Suarez, Michael is equally stylish 
and quippy, this time with a little 
extra swagger, delivering every 
biting takedown with a breezy 
elan, but also with a fragile, earnest 
hunger for a life beyond Ohio that 
recalls the likes of Rachel Berry 
and Kurt Hummel. His great fear is 
having to “go back into the closet, 
marry an ugly girl from my high 
school and run a pashmina cart at 
the mall.”
It’s refreshing, and maybe a 
testament to the state of TV today 
that Michael’s homosexuality is 
neither bad comedy fodder nor 
some nagging source of tension. 
Where Justin’s coming out was a 
seasons-long, 
milked-for-all-the-
drama-it’s-worth saga typical of 
television in the aughts, Michael’s 
is done quickly after meeting his 
newfound father and uncle, who 
are both totally unfazed. “You 
think we have a problem with gay 
people?” Vince chuckles. “Our big 
dream is that someday our gym will 
become a gay gym, because women 
and straight guys are filthy.”
If something like “Champions” 
had aired 10 years ago — even five 
years ago — it would certainly be 
littered with lazy jokes operating 
under the bizarre premise that 

jockish homophobia is hilarious. 
But thankfully, there’s none of that 
here, and the show is far better for 
it.
But one wonders how far the 

“theater-crazed kid meets gym 
bros who don’t understand him” 
gimmick can really go. It got old 

‘In The Heights’ highlights 
real Latinx communities

COMMUNITY CULTURE

Prior to 2008, few musicals 
centered 
around 
(or 
even 
contained) Latinx characters. 
Besides “West Side Story,” a 
musical now heavily criticized 
for its casting of white actors and 
actresses in Latinx roles, Latinx 
communities 
were 
depicted 
almost entirely in a negative light.
Lin-Manuel Miranda’s award-
winning 
“In 
The 
Heights,” 
however, was the first hit musical 
to realistically depict America’s 
Latinx lifestyle. Predating his 
now famous “Hamilton,” it uses 
rap music and bilingual lyrics to 
depict both the strength of the 
Washington Heights community 
in New York City and the 
challenges that it faces. Written 
while Miranda was still in 
college, it is a first-hand depiction 
of the Latinx experience.
“It tells a very recent story 
about 
Latino 
immigration 
in 
the 
United 
States,” 
said 
Musket 
production 
director 
Bruna d’Avila, a junior Theatre 
Performance major in the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance. “It’s 
about a community that is so 
lively and happy and energetic, 
and so many people can relate to 
this story.”
“It really changed the game for 
Latinos in terms of representation 
on stage,” said Gian Perez, a 
sophomore 
acting 
major 
in 
SMTD. “It’s never a piece about 
Latino pain or Latino struggle. 
It’s the first show to meet the 
mainstream 
that 
portrays 
Latinos as just a community with 
a particular culture.”
“The audience in the Midwest 
doesn’t know this as well,” said 
d’Avila. They are “welcoming the 
audience into this community 
like they’ve never felt welcomed 
anywhere before.”
Musket has worked to preserve 
the diverse nature of the original 
production, 
putting 
together 
an extremely diverse cast. It is 
a point of pride for all involved, 
with d’Avila boasting that it 
is, “the most diverse stage the 
University of Michigan has ever 
seen.” It’s a topic that is deeply 

personal to many members of the 
cast.
“I’ve always thought that as a 
Puerto Rican actor, I should be 
limited to Puerto Rican roles,” 
said Perez, “but there are parts 
of being a Latino man that I’m 
learning in these roles.”
The play even goes beyond 
the 
generic 
Latinx 
identity 

to 
pick 
apart 
the 
various 
nationalities within this identity. 
Seemingly subtle differences in 
pronunciation and dialect, for 
example, can represent entirely 
different 
national 
identities 
within the larger Washington 
Heights community.
“It brings together so many 
different styles of Latin American 
music into one musical,” said 
d’Avila.
Though the significance of the 
rap and hip-hop influences in 
the show’s music is now largely 
overshadowed by “Hamilton,” 
it was a groundbreaking idea 
that sparked the careers of 
both Lin-Manuel Miranda and 
music director, arranger and 
orchestrator Alex Lacamoire. 
“When 
I’m 
rapping 
I’m 
actually just speaking,” said 
Perez. “I think that the audiences 
can engage with this much 
more than they can with other 
musicals.”
The musical also features a 
style of rap noticeably different 
than much of what is being 
produced today. It is the rap of 
the early 2000s and earlier, the 
rap that was being produced 
not for streaming services or 
mass-market consumption, but 
for public performances within 
urban environments such as 
Washington Heights.
“I’ve never really felt that 
I could readily access poetry 
that speaks about struggle and 
pain at face value like this,” said 

Perez. “It has that essence of rap 
being used for togetherness and 
unity. It’s about erasing the lines 
between people.”
Earlier this semester, the cast 
was given the rare opportunity 
to work with Alex Lacamoire. 
The musical theatre department, 
through their extensive alumni 
network, was able to reach out 
to Lacamoire. Last week was 
the 10 year anniversary of the 
musical’s premiere on Broadway. 
Lacamoire’s 
recent 
work 
on 
“Hamilton” and “Dear Evan 
Hansen,” however, has distracted 
from this early success — he was 
just as excited to speak about this 
early work as the cast was to work 
with him during the rehearsal 
process.
“It was very emotional to talk 
about ‘In The Heights’ the way 
that he would have 10 years ago,” 
said d’Avila. “He had several 
amazing notes, and it made the 
process so much more exciting.”
And while the story may take 
place in a Latinx community, it is, 
at its core, about the basic struggle 
of human emotion. Whether it is 
the experience of first attending 
college or the struggle of working 
three jobs, it is a deeply relatable 
story 
about 
the 
American 
experience — particularly among 
recent immigrants.
“We all went through what 
Nina goes through,” said d’Avila. 
“We have all had to make a whole 
new group of friends.”
“In The Heights” is a story 
about the Latinx experience in 
contemporary America. It is a 
story of a diverse, multifaceted 
group of people overcoming the 
stereotypes that they face both 
in the real world and on stage. 
A striking relic of the diverse 
American dream as it was defined 
in 2008, the musical is a chilling 
reminder of the changes that 
this concept has undergone, as 
previously marginalized groups 
have sought to redefine it.
“It will open the audience’s 
eyes to a different perspective,” 
said d’Avila. “It’s about all those 
who have immigrated to America. 
It’s a message from them saying, 
‘We’re OK. We’re doing fine.’ And 
it’s about sharing this story as 
only theater can.”

‘Rudderless’ demonstrates 
painful struggle of healing

FILM NOTEBOOK

Art and emotion share an 
essential link, and in order to 
thoroughly leave an impression 
on their audiences, artists must 
harness what they feel within 
and translate it into something 
tangible. As one of the most 
intense human emotions, grief 
is a timeless topic explored by 
artists, and one that William 
H. Macy’s film “Rudderless” 
exemplifies and entwines with 
song. Severely unrecognized, 
“Rudderless” is a film that 
will draw audience members 
under with sorrow, while still 
managing to entrance them 
with the marvelous and curative 
powers of music. 
Desperate and floundering 
to regain purpose following 
his son Josh’s (Miles Heizer 
“Nerve”) death in a university 
shooting, Sam (Billy Crudup 
“Almost Famous”) is, as the 
film title suggests, rudderless. 
Quitting his high-paying suit-
and-tie job for a construction 
gig and splitting from his wife, 
Sam enters a life of solitude, 
sustained by low-budget meals 
and 
booze 
on 
an 
isolated 
houseboat. Despite his clear 
attempts to distance himself 
from the outside world and from 
the memories of the past, Sam 
slowly begins to unravel his grief 
when he happens upon drafted 
songs written and recorded by 
his son. He reconnects with one 
of the passions that he and his 
son shared: music. 
Through 
the 
reluctant 
relationship that he develops 
with 
energetic, 
fanboyish 
Quentin (Anton Yelchin “Star 
Trek”), 
who 
idolizes 
Sam’s 
musical prowess, Sam is able 
to regain a semblance of the 

musical connection he shared 
with his son. Crudup and 
Yelchin’s portrayal of Sam and 
Quentin’s slow-growing bond is 
golden. On the surface, through 
his exudence of childishness 
that counters Sam’s uncaring, 
asshole 
attitude, 
Yelchin’s 
character 
could 
be 
labeled 
as a convention, serving as a 
“replacement” of sorts for the 
hole in Sam’s life left by his 
son. However, what Crudup 
and Yelchin are able to conjure 
on screen feels so genuine 
that, convention or not, we 
want to buy into it. Though in 
completely different life stages, 
Sam and Quentin are able to find 
an 
unexpected 
commonality 
through their affinity for music. 
For Quentin, his musical talent 
represents a glimmer of hope for 
finding a path to success, fame 
and money, while for Sam, it is 
a means of holding on to what 
little he has left of his son. 
Along 
with 
the 
fabulous 
performances 
by 
Yelchin 
and 
Crudup, 
another 
commendable piece of this film 
is its soundtrack. A perfectly 
compiled mixture of tunes sung 
by a mashup of artists, the music 
in this movie is truly masterful 
in its remarkable ability to be 
simultaneously 
raw, 
spirited 
and 
heartbreaking. 
Filled 
with both the slower and more 
downcast pieces composed by 
Sam’s son and a variety of new, 
more upbeat songs crafted by 
Sam and the band, the blend of 
contrasting tones in the songs 
creates a bittersweet effect, 
reflective 
of 
Sam’s 
broader 
internal 
struggle. 
On 
the 
one hand, music for Sam has 
become a means of regaining a 
sense of joy and light in his life, 
emphasized through fast-tempo, 
eccentric and playful numbers 
like a rock-infused “Wheels on 

the Bus” and “Real Friends.” At 
the same time, however, playing 
Josh’s songs functions as a 
cutting and consistent reminder 
that his son’s presence in his life 
only exists through the songs he 
has left behind.
The final scene, in which 
Sam strums one last song, “Sing 
Along,” before the screen goes 
black, is perhaps the film’s most 
impactful 
exemplification 
of 
grief. By the end of the film, 
Sam is not cured of the pain 
and heartache that the death 
of his son has inflicted because 
there is no such cure. The depth 
of this closing scene comes 
from the fact that it does not 
attempt to provide resolution 
or a guarantee of happiness for 
Sam in the future, nor does it 
illogically suggest that Sam’s 
grief 
will 
eventually 
fade. 
Instead, it demonstrates Sam 
confronting the grief, owning 
it, playing for his son, not out of 
acceptance of his death, but out 
of remembrance. Finishing the 
song, Sam tearfully sings, “I will 
find a way to sing your song,” a 
final promise to hold on to the 
memories of his son, painful as 
it may be. 
In its essence, “Rudderless” 
is a film about finding direction 
and 
regaining 
purpose. 
It 
explores 
the 
complexity 
of 
grief, the necessity of friendship 
and the healing capabilities 
of music. Far quieter than its 
contemporary — the popular, 
bold and critically adored music-
centric picture “Whiplash” — 
“Rudderless” is undeservingly 
overshadowed. 
Despite 
the 
film’s lack of recognition and 
appreciation by the cinematic 
community, its poignancy and 
profundity is undeniable and in 
passing it by, viewers would be 
missing out on a true treasure of 
a film.

pretty fast on “Glee,” and it gets 
old pretty fast in the pilot. Jokes 
that write themselves tend not to 
be very funny. At a certain point, 
the audience sees it all coming, so 
the show will have to work to avoid 
falling into the sorts of clichés its 
premise suggests it will fall into.
The bad news? “Champions” 

isn’t instantly impressive. The good 
news? Network sitcoms rarely are 
— “The Mindy Project” certainly 
wasn’t — and Kaling’s shows tend 
to be at their best once they’ve 
gotten into a reliable groove 
and established a set of familiar 
rhythms. 
What 
“Champions” 
will have to do to be fresh and 

compelling is what “The Mindy 
Project” and “The Office” often 
struggled to do in later seasons: 
balance out the zaniness with 
some narrative heft and walk that 
fine line between character and 
caricature. It has all the pieces 
of a great comedy, all that’s left is 
putting them together.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘THERE’S A REASON’

 It’s been two years since 
Brooklyn-based indie pop 
group Wet last came out with 
new music. After their debut 
Don’t You in 2016, they pretty 
much fell off the map, giving 
no indication that they were 
working on future records 
other than the occasional 
releases of remixed versions of 
old songs.
 Until this past week’s sur-
prise, “There’s a Reason”: 
evidence that Wet is back in 
the studio with a potential new 
album just around the corner.
 The single is also evidence 
that Wet have used their hia-
tus as a time to explore their 
sound, gaining confidence and 
adding weight to their previ-

ously noncommittal synthpop 
ambivalence. “There’s a Rea-

son,” contrasting the washy 
ballads that often times turned 
Don’t You into a haze of direc-
tionless rambling, is a bubbly 
celebration. The steady per-
cussion keeps a lighthearted 
tempo, the nearly nonexistent 
synths clink together in the 
background like champagne 
glasses. Towards the end of the 
track, dulcet string instrumen-

tation give the listeners one 
final serenade.
 Throughout it all, the steady 
optimism of frontwoman Kelly 
Zutrau’s vocals holds the song’s 
various components together. 
“There’s a reason you’re by 
my side again,” she sings over 
a beat that leaves no room for 
Don’t You’s hesitation.
 With “There’s a Reason,” 
Wet proves themselves to 
be new and improved; self-
assured, they back every note 
with a conviction that gives 
their melodies substance. It’s 
almost spring, and Wet is ready 
to blossom.

litter the floor. Soda cans lie 
empty on the table. It’s 2 a.m.. 
“Mario Kart” is on the TV. Is 
this a middle school sleepover? 
No, it’s an average Wednesday 
in some dorm or apartment or 
student house somewhere on a 
college campus. College kids like 
to play video games, but what a 
lot of college kids like to do more 
than play video games is play old 
video games. The GameCube is 
a popular console on campus, 
with perhaps 70 percent of 
its usage coming purely from 
“Super Smash Bros. Melee.” 
“Wii Sports” still makes regular 
appearances from time to time. 
But “Mario Kart” remains the 
gold standard. It’s not unusual 
to see an Xbox 360 or Playstation 
2 right next to a much nicer and 
more expensive newer model on 
the mantel. What’s the appeal of 
old games? Is it simple nostalgia? 
Or is it something deeper?

When I left for college after 

high school I brought my family’s 
Nintendo Wii with me. I didn’t 
take the PS4 that had become a 
mainstay over the previous year 
or two. Part of the reason for 
this was because it was easier to 
convince my younger brother to 
let me take the Wii than the PS4, 
but part of the reason was also 
that I thought the Wii would be 
a more fun thing to have. I was 
right about that, but not for the 
reason I had originally thought. 
While 
my 
freshman 
year 

roommate and I did play some 
“Mario Kart” and “Wii Sports” 
from time to time, what really 
made the Wii worth our while 
was its backward capability 
with GameCube games. We 
picked up a copy of an early 
2000s children’s game, “Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Battle 
Nexus,” for a few dollars at a 
game shop and reignited our 
childhoods.

I cannot recommend this 

game 
enough 
to 
anyone. 

Designed for children by people 
who clearly didn’t care that 
much about the finished product, 
the game is simple enough to 
seem easy but poorly designed 
enough to be excruciatingly 
difficult. Some of the jumps 
between 
platforms 
require 

mind-boggling precision. Many 
of the boss battles took us weeks 
to complete. It had a simplicity 
you wouldn’t find in modern 
games and a stupidity that was 

almost charming. Would we 
have ever bought a Ninja Turtles 
game that was released for 
the PS4? Doubtful. Something 

about it being a GameCube 
added to the mystique. We later 
picked up a Hot Wheels game 
that was actually impossible 
and the first and third games in 
the Turtles GameCube series, 
neither of which were as good 
as “Battle Nexus” and were soon 
abandoned.

One of my current roommates 

brought home his old PS2 after 
Thanksgiving and has spent 

the past few months playing 
through the game version of 
“Shrek 2.” Multiple members of a 
student org I’m in bring their old 
Nintendo DSs on every trip we 
go on so they can play Pokémon. 
Old games have a strange appeal. 
“Super Smash Melee” is still 
deemed 
the 
greatest 
Smash 

game, even though both Brawl 
and the one they released for the 
Wii U feature more players and 
more characters. Graphics have 
improved dramatically since the 

mid-2000s, so why is there an 
appeal in cracking out “NCAA 
2005” for the Xbox 360? 

For 
a 
culture 
that 
is 

increasingly growing cordless, 
cords 
are 
starting 
to 
have 

nostalgic value. Just the act of 
having to plug a controller into 
a TV and sit within a certain 
range to not pull the console off 
the ledge adds a level of intimacy 
with the product that doesn’t 
exist in modern videogames. The 
fun factor of, “Oh, I remember 
this level,” and the journey of 
rediscovery is an easy way to 
form connections to childhood 
with people whom you’ve only 
known since the age of 17 or 18.

Recently “Wii Sports Resort,” 

the “Wii Sports” spinoff that 
required an extra “Wii Motion 
Plus” adapter for the controllers 
in order to be played, has become 
my friend’s go-to late night game 
of choice. The jankyness of the 
controls, the randomness of the 
game designs, the hilarious idea 
that Nintendo actually released 
a game designed purely to get 
people to buy an extra add-on 
for their Wii-motes and that 
people actually did it, all of that 
has made “Wii Sports Resort” a 
great addition to our late night 
nostalgia. Expense is surely 
another reason why old games 
appeal to college students. Video 
games 
nowadays 
are 
really 

expensive. New games can go for 
as much as $80 just for a single 
disc or download. But you can get 
an old PS2 for like $30 on eBay. 
These things don’t break often 
either. Most GameCubes were 
made between 2001 and 2005 
and most people I know who 
still have one have never had a 
problem with it. A buddy of mine 
had an old Xbox that had to be 
kept a precise angle so as not to 
shred the disc in it but that was 
still remarkably useable after 
almost 15 years of use. This kind 
of tactile upkeep adds a sense of 
character to an object and gives 
the games a story, a story that is 
funny to tell to others.

So the next time you wonder 

if your house needs some more 
videogames, 
maybe 
consider 

going backwards and picking 
up an old Wii, Xbox or PS2. Or 
go to your grandma’s and dig 
an old Atari or N64 out of the 
attic. For many college students, 
video games are a semi-constant 
part of their lives. The older the 
better.

Starnone deftly sketches 
a ghost story in ‘Trick’

The late and great American 

author 
Henry 
James 
was 

fascinated with the ghost story. 
Unlike most writers of horror 
fiction, however, James was 
not concerned with a ghost’s 
capacity to scare. Rather, he 
focused on its ability to function 
as dark reflections of humanity, 
how they supernaturally guide 
us through the darker side 
of the human psyche. Ghosts 
are “the strange and sinister 
embroidered on the very type 
of the normal and easy,” writes 
James in the preface of his final 
ghost story, “The Jolly Corner.”

Daniele 
Mallarico, 

the 
central 
character 
of 

contemporary Italian author 
Domenico Starnone’s “Trick,” 
is very much a ghost himself. 
An 
aging 
illustrator 
past 

his prime, Daniele has been 
commissioned to create images 
to embellish a deluxe edition 
of “The Jolly Corner.” While 
this task certainly occupies 
his 
time 
and 
his 
fading 

livelihood, Daniele primarily 
functions as a grandfather as 
the book unfolds, as he labors 
to look after his four-year-old 
grandson, Mario. The contrast 
between Daniele’s overbearing 
protectiveness 
(manifested 

sometimes in meanness) and 
Mario’s advanced innocence 
for a boy his age defines the 
relationship 
between 
the 

two 
but 
creates 
problems. 

Conversations between those 
two push the narrative forward, 
as 
Starnone 
explores 
the 

connection between artistry 
and age.

Translated masterfully into 

English 
by 
Pulitzer 
Prize-

winning author Jhumpa Lahiri, 
“Trick” — like “The Jolly 
Corner” — is “about the horror 
of returning to one’s place of 
origin,” states Lahiri in her 
introduction. Daniele has to 

return to his ancestral home in 
Naples, which has now become 
the modern living space for 
his daughter and her family. 
And while his daughter and 
her husband are off at a work 
conference having relationship 
issues of their own, Daniele 

has to care for the boundless 
ball of energy that is Mario. 
While Mario oscillates at 100 
kilometers per hour between 
playing with his action figures, 
watching TV and just generally 
jumping and moving around, 
Daniele is weakened in his 
old age and constrained in 
his 
childhood 
home. 
This 

contrast of bodies — “One 
small and mighty, the other 
large, laid low” — is central to 
the relationship dynamics of 
“Trick.”

Much like Spencer Brydon, 

the protagonist of “The Jolly 
Corner,” Daniele prowls the 
house he once grew up and 
confronts the ghost of the man 
he might have been. Only for 
Daniele, this ghost is alive and 
has manifested itself in Mario. 
For a four-year-old, Mario is 
quite capable but limited by 
his size; for example, he knows 
exactly how to make breakfast 
for his family and how his 
father takes his coffee, but 
he can’t reach the milk in the 
fridge. In this way, Mario and 
Daniele are a perfect pairing, 
yet they never play off of each 
other’s strengths. Many a time 
their relationship is strained 
because Daniele lacks the vigor 
to do what Mario asks of him. 
The climax of the narrative, 
a “trick” Mario plays on his 
grandfather, 
is 
humorous 

on paper, but is exacerbated 
because completing the “trick” 

requires Mario to go beyond his 
physical capabilities and listen, 
for once, to Daniele.

The crucial moment that 

defines 
the 
relationship 

between 
grandfather 
and 

grandson 
happens 
when 

Daniele finally allows Mario 
to work alongside him, both 
drawing. While Daniele works 
on the James story, Mario, 
miming his elders in a way 
only a child can do, decides 
to draw his grandpa. When 
Daniele gazes at Mario’s work 
to see what he drew, he is in 
awe of the “natural harmony 
of composition, a fanciful sense 
of color.” Yet Mario doesn’t 
realize the simple perfection 
in his drawing, which causes 
Daniele to be overcome with 
horror: “I really was my ghost.”

After 
Mario 
is 
finally 

reunited with his parents and 
the story ends, an appendix 
awaits the reader, presented 
as Daniele’s diary before and 
during his time with Mario, 
accompanied by some of his 
illustrations. To Lahiri, it is “an 
organ literally cut out of the 
story, 
seemingly 
extraneous 

but in fact fundamental to our 
understanding.” Providing a 
crucial subtext to the action 
of the book, this appendix 
fuses Starnone’s writing with 
James’s fiction, glued together 
by Lahiri’s translation. But 
while 
Starnone 
willfully 

combines 
art 
of 
the 
past, 

he does so with purpose. In 
Mario’s purity of age, he only 
does what he knows and copies 
the work of his grandfather, of 
the past. In copying, however, 
he creates something entirely 
new, 
something 
comparable 

to his grandfather’s work but 
stands entirely on its own. 
While most artists are well past 
their childhood, with “Trick,” 
Starnone reminds them to never 
forget their initial inspirations 
and how their art serves as a 
vivid link between past and 
present.

Too early to start thinking about next year for Barnes Arico, Wolverines?

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team finally got what 
it 
wanted. 
During 
Monday 

night’s 
Selection 
Show, 
the 

Wolverines were chosen as a 
seven seed in this year’s NCAA 
Tournament.

The tournament bid called for 

a moment of celebration for the 
team. The last time Michigan 
(10-6 Big Ten, 22-9 overall) made 
it to the tourney was 2013, during 
Kim Barnes Arico’s first season 
as head coach. The Wolverines 
defeated Villanova and made it 
to the second round, but their 
run ended when they fell to 
Stanford, 73-40.

Since then, though, Michigan 

hasn’t had the same post-season 
luck. 
The 
Wolverines 
have 

come close to getting bids on 
multiple occasions. Last year, 
they finished third in the Big Ten 
and racked up 22 victories by the 
time the Selection Show rolled 
around, yet were shocked to find 
out their efforts weren’t enough. 
Instead, they went on to win the 
WNIT Championship.

Because 
of 
last 
year’s 

disappointment, guard Katelynn 
Flaherty and forward Jillian 
Dunston entered their senior 
years having never played in the 
tournament.

That’s right.
Flaherty, the school’s all-

time leading scorer — man or 
woman — and Dunston, the 
team’s defensive backbone and 
leader, have never played under 
the big spotlight. That’s why this 
year’s opportunity is all the more 
important to them.

“Thrilled 
for 
our 
seniors 

and for our program,” Barnes 
Arico 
said 
following 
the 

Selection Show. “Katelynn and 
Jillian deserve to be watched 
on the national screen. … Just 
happy that they will have an 

opportunity to represent the 
University of Michigan and the 
‘Block M’ before they graduate.”

Given all that’s happening, 

it’s hard not to fixate on what is 
to come over the 
next week. On 
Friday, Flaherty 
and 
Dunston 

will 
live 
out 

their 
dreams 

when 
Michigan 

takes on No. 10 
seed 
Northern 

Colorado (26-6) 
in Waco, Tex.

As 
the 

tournament 
approaches, 
though, the end of the season 
still looms overhead. At any 
moment they could lose and it’s 
all over. With that said, one can’t 

help but wonder — what happens 
next year?

With Flaherty and Dunston 

gone, the Wolverines will have 
big shoes to fill. Junior guard 

Nicole 
Munger 

and junior center 
Hallie 
Thome 

both return and 
will likely play a 
more prominent 
role. The duo has 
started in every 
game this season 
and has played 
an 
integral 

part 
in 
the 

team’s 
success, 

averaging 9.4 and 

17 points, respectively.

Munger’s 
offensive 

contributions will be essential 
next season. She is shooting 41 

percent from beyond the arc, 
which will need to be put on full 
display next year to help make up 
for Flaherty’s departure. With 
Flaherty gone, the offense may 
also shift toward post play by 
giving the ball to Thome more.

Freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown and freshman guard 
Deja Church are also returning. 
Brown 
was 
a 
starter 
until 

suffering an injury in February 
against Michigan State. But 
when healthy, she was an impact 
player. As the season progressed, 
Brown got into her groove and 
shot at least 50 percent from 
the field six games in a row. Her 
recovery and return to the court 
next season will be vital to her 
team’s well-being.

Church 
should 
see 
more 

minutes 
as 
well. 
Prior 
to 

becoming 
a 
starter 
due 
to 

Brown’s injury, Church was 
Michigan’s first player off the 
bench and often gave the team 
a much-needed spark. She will 
likely 
need 
to 

replace 
Flaherty 

at point.

Sophomore 

forward 
Kayla 

Robbins 
and 

sophomore guard 
Akienreh Johnson 
have 
potential 

to 
work 
their 

way 
into 
the 

starting 
lineup, 

too. 
Johnson 

significantly 
improved late in the season — 
when Brown went down — and 
notched 19, 17 and 13 points 
against Minnesota, Maryland 

and Penn State, respectively.

The roster is expected to 

expand next season as well, with 
five freshmen set to join the 
squad.

Five-star guard Amy Dilk 

is Michigan’s top recruit. The 
Carmel, Ind. native is ranked No. 
39 in her class by ESPN. She’s a 
talented ball-handler and scorer, 
so if the transition to the college 
game goes smoothly, she could 
help fill in Flaherty’s spot.

“She has an unbelievable IQ 

for the game and can see things 
happening two steps ahead of 
anyone else,” Barnes Arico told 
MGoBlue on Nov. 8. “She is a true 
point guard with tremendous 
size that we have not had at 
the position before. She has the 
ability to see over smaller guards 
and to really make everyone 
around her better.

“She can score in so many ways 

— off the bounce, from the three-
point line. She runs her team and 
has a great feel for the game. She 
has played for a great high school 
program, and we have watched 
her develop throughout the years 
into one of the top point guards 
in the country. She is going to 
have an immediate impact on 
this program.”

Four-star recruits in forwards 

Naz Hillmon, Emily Kiser and 

guard 
Ariel 

Young 
and 

three-star 
guard Danielle 
Rauch 
will 

also 
look 
to 

contribute.

Though 

it 
will 
be 

challenging 
to 

make 
up 
for 

losing Flaherty 
and 
Dunston, 

the pieces to the 

puzzle are there. And if Barnes 
Arico can put them together 
effectively, then she may be able 
to build another tournament bid.

Michigan’s mental toughness put to test at NCAA Indoor Championships

Mental 
fortitude 
isn’t 

something that comes to mind 
when 
talking 
about 
weight 

throws and shot puts.

But for the Michigan men’s 

track and field team, that wasn’t 
the case this weekend at the 
NCAA Indoor Championships.

“I was thinking too much,” 

said junior Joe Ellis. “That was 
the real bane of the throwing 
events. You just have to let your 
body take over, and I started to 
think, ‘I just really want to blast 
each as far as I could’ instead of 
just letting the process naturally 
happen 
as 
it 
happened 
all 

season.”

The mental aspect of the sport 

was put to the test early in the 
rounds for both weight throw 
participants, Ellis and senior 
Grant Cartwright. Coming into 
the championship, Ellis had 
posted career-highs in all areas. 
He credits the recent success 
to a shift in emphasis towards 
technique.

Whereas 
last 
year 
was 

frontloaded with room strength 
training — specifically squats — 
this year was fully focused on 

improving techniques.

“I added an extra turn,” Ellis 

said on his technique changes. 
“I do four turns in the ring and I 
think that added a more difficult, 
technical aspects, but when I hit 
a good one, it’s usually farther 
because of that. I’m a lot more 
technically sound.

“This year was way more on 

the technical (side), trying to 
figure out how to just throw far 
right away, and I’ve done that 
all season. I threw pretty deep 
all season, and this was kind of 
a shocker, when I fouled my first 
two, because before this meet, 
I had only fouled two or three 
throws.”

The result, despite finishing 

fifth in the event and earning 
First-Team 
All-American 

accolades, was not what Ellis had 
expected or wanted. Breaking 
multiple school records through 
the regular season, expectations 
couldn’t have been higher for 
him.

However, he just couldn’t cash 

in.

“It’s the nature of the event,” 

Ellis said, “and you only get six 
chances or three chances, and if 
you’re lucky, you get all six.”

Though 
disappointed 

he couldn’t do better, Ellis’ 
performance 
wasn’t 
one 
to 

forget.

“I’m phrasing it a lot like it 

wasn’t a successful weekend, but 
in fact it was,” he said laughing. 
“Becoming a First-Team All-
American is super difficult, and 
this is my highest performance 
I’ve done yet at any national meet. 
… You were saying improvement 
from last year. You know seventh 
(last year), I felt like I squeaked 
in, but fifth, I felt like I was really 
part of the conversation all year.”

It just so happens that Ellis 

had found himself in the highest-
leverage situation he’s been in 
all season — and on the biggest 
stage. Fouling his first two 
rounds out of the sector put 
immense pressure to throw a 
big one for the third round with 
the goal of ultimately qualifying. 
Already swamped with thoughts 
that troubled him in the early 
rounds, he stepped back and 
took to his friend and teammate 
Cartwright.

Cartwright calmed him down 

and brought him back into focus. 
As Michigan coach Jerry Clayton 
put it, it was a “competitive 
advantage” to have friends both 
participate in the same event 

— the NCAA Championships at 
that. But for Ellis, it was a helpful 
beacon to remind him it was just 
another throw, allowing him to 
post a 22.55-meter mark.

Cartwright faced a similar 

situation as Ellis, but rather than 
fouling the first two rounds by 
throwing outside the sectors, 
he committed foot fouls. For 
his first attempt, he threw what 
could have been a qualifying 
First-Team All-American throw, 
but he couldn’t hold the front of 
the ring. For his second throw, 
just narrowly, Cartwright fouled 
on another good throw, which 
was met with skepticism from 
the Michigan coaching staff.

After 
filing 
a 
protest 
to 

challenge the call, his throw was 

reviewed and confirmed a foul. 
Just as Ellis had, Cartwright 
had to face his final throw with 
mounting 
pressure 
to 
make 

the final round. He failed to 
qualify, throwing 20.82 meters 
to get a 12th-place finish, good 
for Second-Team All-American 
honors.

“You have to go after the 

throws and hit the rhythm,” 
Clayton said. “The problem is 
you can’t — I guess people say 
to just take a ‘safe throw’ — but 
you can’t really take a safe throw 
at this level and make the finals, 
especially with two fouls.”

Sophomore Andrew Liskowitz 

also 
got 
Second-Team 
All-

American honors with his 18.38-
meter shot put. Just as the other 

Wolverine participants, his first 
two attempts were met with 
fouls.

“That week, you always have 

on your mind, ‘You have to make 
finals,’ and there were 16 other 
people in the heat which was a 
little irregular,” Ellis said. “And 
so when you have your first one, 
you wait about 15 minutes before 
you have a chance to get back in 
the ring, and so it really takes a 
toll on you mentally.”

The 
mental 
strife 
was 

evident 
through 
Michigan’s 

performances 
for 
what 
was 

an underachievement by the 
standards of the players and 
program, but there was plenty to 
learn from for the players going 
forward.

Montana Kaimin writer offers insight into Michigan’s first round opponent

Montana’s name popped up on 

the screen as the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
first-round 

opponent and you froze. You 
knew nothing about the Big Sky 
Tournament champions. And you 
weren’t alone.

Michigan coach John Beilein’s 

initial reaction was equally tepid. 

“Is Montana the Grizzlies?” 

Beilein said shortly after the 
bracket announcement. “I’m sure 
they’ve got a great team. They 
wouldn’t have 26 wins without a 
great team.”

And as Beilein and his staff are 

busy cutting tape and concocting 
a gameplan, The Daily reached out 
to Jackson Wagner — a reporter 
for the Montana Kaimin, the 
University of Montana’s student 
newspaper — to get the lowdown 
on the Grizzlies ahead of Thursday 
night’s 9:50 pm ET tipoff:

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 
For 

Michigan fans who maybe haven’t 
seen Montana play, who are the 
main two guys to watch out for and 
the skillsets they bring?

Wagner: I’d say the main two 

guys to watch out for is Montana’s 
backcourt. Mike Oguine is a 
hyper-athlete basically. He gets to 
the rim almost relentlessly. He’ll 
try, bacially everytime he gets 
the ball, to get to the rim, but he 
also has expanded his shot this 
year. He’s our Big Sky Conference 
Tournament MVP and the Big Sky 
Defensive Player of the Year. Just 
all over the floor. He plays with a 
ton of energy. And Ahmaad Rorie 
is the Oregon transfer that is easily 
the best scorer on the team when 
his shot’s falling. He’s had some off 
games, but when he gets hot, he’s 
a really, really good shooter and a 
really good ballhandler. He made 
the SportsCenter Top 10 with a 
crossover in the Championship 
game. Those two are the main guys 
to watch for, I’d say.

TMD: You wrote in your article 

the Big Sky Tournament run was 
improbable. How so?

Wagner: I think it was just kind 

of the nature of what happened. 
This is the best Montana team 
we’ve seen in awhile. I would say 
it’s the best since the mid-2000s 
when they beat Nevada in an 
NCAA (Tournament) game, but 
they just trailed in a lot of games 
and it seemed like everything was 
kind of going against them. We’ve 
been good with this coach, Coach 
Travis Decuire, but haven’t gotten 
it done in the Big Sky Tournament. 
So when things started to go 
against them, it looked like it was 
going to be another early exit. 
But they came back in multiple 
games, they were down 11 in the 
championship game, came back. 
That’s something we have seen 
from them all year — they’ve been 
a super good second half team. 
Decuire has made a ton of halftime 
adjustments where, they would go 
in down five or six and come out 
and win games by 15 points. It was 

something we had seen all year, but 
come tourney time it seemed like 
teams had made the adjustments 
in the first half and then Decuire 
would outsmart them in the second 
half to get those wins.

TMD: Was there a pattern to 

those adjustments?

Wagner: I think it was mostly 

defensive changes that he made. 
Eastern Washington has a player, 
Bogdan Bliznyuk — the Big Sky’s 
MVP of the regular season. He’s 
kind of a bigger guy, so Decuire 
started with the post on him to try 
to keep him outside, but then he 
was controlling the (championship) 
game basically as a point forward. 
So Decuire switched Rorie, who’s 
our smallest player, and typically 
not a great defender, onto him 
and it just threw everything that 
Eastern Washington was doing 
off. That’s kind of been what’s 
happened in a lot of games — 
defensive changes that he makes. 

They’re kind of balanced as far as 
where they’re at in rankings terms 
of offense and defense, but it’s the 
defense that’s won more games for 
them this year.

TMD: What are a couple 

strengths and weaknesses of this 
team?

Wagner: The biggest strength 

has been that anybody can be on 
on any night, which especially 
looking forward against a team 
like Michigan is going to be harder 
to do. But against Big Sky teams 
they basically have — one through 
seven — that anyone can go off for 
a 15-to-20-point game. Timmy 
Falls and Sayeed Pridgett both 
off the bench have been pretty 
dynamic as far as, if the Grizz are 
lacking scoring they just plug one 
of those two guys in and it seems 
like every time they get a response 
from them. The big guys down low, 
Jamar Akoh and Fabijan Krslovic, 
have both just been pretty efficient. 

They look to Akoh a lot more, but 
Krslovic is a high efficiency guy. He 
doesn’t get a lot of looks, but he’ll 
probably get close to 10 points in a 
game just on layups coming from 
people focusing elsewhere. One 
through seven being able to step up 
has definitely been their strength 
— they’ve failed in the past because 
of (isolation) and guys trying to 
take over games on their own, and 
that hasn’t happened this year. 

The weakness, I would say, is just 

the size, kind of, and athleticism. 
6-foot-8 is basically as big as we 
go, and not dominant down low 
defensively. There’s no real rim 
protector on this team. Krslovic 
and Akoh are both good defenders. 
Krslovic is a really smart defender, 
but not very athletic and not great 
at defending the rim. They’ll try to 
take a lot of charges but not get a lot 
of blocks, I would say.

TMD: A lot of talk in Michigan 

has been about the matchup 

problem with Michigan’s bigs 
who can stretch the floor. Is that 
a problem you agree with? Why or 
why not?

Wagner: I think, especially 

looking at Wagner, that’s a guy 
already with three inches on 
basically anyone the Grizz will put 
on him, and the ability to stretch 
the floor. I dont think that’s as 
huge of a thing, because we don’t 
have big guys that just sit in the 
paint and protect the rim. Both of 
them can move pretty well. As far 
as getting out to him on the three-
point line, I think they’ll be OK. 
But just the sheer size. If Michigan 
decides to pound the ball into him, 
I don’t really see the Grizz having 
much of an answer for that.

TMD: What do you think is the 

formula for an upset?

Wagner: I think the formula 

basically is they have to be almost 
perfect 
offensively. 
I 
think 

defensively, Michigan is going 
to exploit the mismatch down 
low. Other than that, I think 
Oguine and those guys can kind 
of hold their own. They’re a good 
enough team defensively that I 
don’t think Michigan will be able 
to just beat them by scoring 90 
points, like we see with some of 
these matchups. But for Montana, 
Ahmaad Rohrie is going to have 
to have a big day. They’re going 
to have to be knocking down the 
3-point shot, which is something 
they’ve struggled with at times this 
year. Their starter at the ‘3’, Bobby 
Moorehead, hit a huge shot when 
they were down in the Big Sky 
Conference Tournament, but he 
hasn’t really proved himself from 
the 3-point arc. But I think that’s 
going to be basically what Montana 
needs — to get a few buckets down 
low early, to get shooters open, 
then they just need to be almost 
perfect shooting the ball.

TMD: Prediction?
Wagner: I think Michigan is 

easily the favorite. You guys are 
coming in super hot and have more 
talent and athleticism. I think it’ll 
be fairly low scoring, maybe like 
66-52, Michigan.

Marody, Hughes headline Big Ten Honors 

While the Michigan hockey 

team awaits its destiny in the 
looming 
NCAA 
Tournament, 

five players already have reason 
to celebrate after earning all-
conference 
awards 
Tuesday 

afternoon.

Junior 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody netted All-Big Ten first-

team honors and clinched the 
Big Ten scoring title. Freshman 
defenseman Quinn Hughes was 
named to the All-Big Ten Freshman 
Team and was also a second-team 
conference selection.

Junior forward Cooper Marody earned the Big Ten scoring title with 27 points in 24 conference games.

Senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone also earned second-
team distinction and sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne was 
an honorable mention. Senior 
defenseman Sam Piazza was voted 
Michigan’s Big Ten Sportsmanship 
honoree for the second straight 
season.

Marody notched 27 points in 

24 conference games, becoming 
just the third Wolverine ever to 
be the Big Ten scoring champion. 
In his first full season donning 
the maize and blue, the Brighton, 
Mich. native boasted 46 points — 
14 goals and 32 assists, which rank 
third in the country and first in the 
Big Ten.

Hughes entered the season 

as a blue-chip prospect for the 
upcoming 2018 NHL Entry Draft 
and didn’t disappoint. Described 
by Michigan coach Mel Pearson to 
be “worth the price of admission,” 
he tallied 24 assists, first among Big 
Ten freshman, third nationally and 
the most by a rookie defenseman 
in program history. The youngest 
player in college hockey, Hughes’ 
28 points tied for 12th in the 
NCAA, and rank third among Big 
Ten freshman and third most for a 
freshman in Michigan annals.

On 
a 
team 
with 
16 

underclassmen 
— 
the 
third 

youngest in college hockey — 
Calderone’s 
veteran 
presence 

shined when the lights were 
brightest and Michigan needed a 
leader. In his senior campaign, the 
captain posted career-highs with 
40 points, 17 assists and 23 goals 
— most in the Big Ten and eighth 
nationally.

When asked about the line of 

Calderone, Marody and senior 
forward 
Dexter 
Dancs 
after 

Saturday night’s 3-2 overtime 
loss to Ohio State in the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinal, Pearson 
was quick to praise its leadership.

“They gave us what they have 

all year … on and off the ice when 
we need a goal,” he said. “That’s 
what you expect from seniors and 
juniors. It’s been fun for me to be 
around these guys, I hope I get 
another couple of weeks.”

While Hughes protected the 

blueline, 
Pearson 
constantly 

underscored the importance of 
the goaltender being the best 
defenseman on the ice. After 
splitting starts with classmate 
Jack LaFontaine, Lavigne assumed 
the starting job halfway through 
the season. He recorded a career-

high 16 wins in 30 starts, averaging 
2.79 goals allowed per game and 
posting a .910 save percentage.

Helping 
Lavigne 
in 
the 

defensive zone was the always-
dependable Piazza. During his 
final season in Ann Arbor, he set 
career bests in games played (35), 
assists (13), points (15) and shots 
(64). The blueliner was nominated 
as a finalist for the Senior CLASS 
award, 
recognizing 
student 

athletes who shine on and beyond 
the ice.

The 
prestige 
of 
awards 

notwithstanding, after a dismal 
15-win campaign in 2016-17, the 
Wolverines are less than a week 
away from returning to the NCAA 
Tournament and having a chance 
at a national championship. And 
that’s in part because of those 
awarded Tuesday.

“Coming in at the start of the 

season, nobody really believed in 
us,” Marody said. “Nobody saw 
us having any success this year, 
and we proved people wrong. We 
did that by out-working opponents 
and coming together as a team. 
Battling to the end is something we 
take a lot of pride in, and we know 
we’re going to have to do that to 
have success in the Tournament.”

Michigan in Color
BBUM: 
Our History


T

he summer before my freshman 
year, I worried about what I was 
going to do in college. There 

was so much pressure to grow, to get 
involved, to build that résumé. One day, 
I received a copy of The Michigan Daily 
in the mail. And I thought: Why not? As 
a questioning, indecisive, undeclared 
English major, getting involved with 
journalism was probably a good idea.

But there was a problem. I didn’t like 

journalism. The thought of writing for a 
newspaper scared me. I liked to write, 
but I didn’t like to write articles. I felt 
like I couldn’t report news brilliantly or 
state strong opinions eloquently. I didn’t 
like the idea of being forced to write a 
certain number of pieces by a deadline. 
So much for that.

However, as I was browsing The 

Daily’s website, I found a section that 
stopped me mid-scroll: Copy Desk. I read 
the description, and I knew this was the 
role for me. I sent an email asking how 
I could join the copy desk and received 
an answer back from the copy chief. I 
starred the email and spent the rest of 
my summer keeping this job in the back 
of my head, looking forward to applying.

Before I knew it, I arrived on campus. 

I found The Daily at Festifall. I attended 
the mass meeting. I took the copy quiz. 
I shadowed shifts. I took the post-test. I 
got the job.

“When do you get promoted to writing 

articles?” many of my friends obliviously 
asked when I explained my new job to 
them.

“No,” I would reply. “I applied to be 

a copy editor. I don’t want to write — I 
want to edit.”

This 
response 
is 
often 
met 
by 

confusion and polite, though piteous, 
chuckles. Who wants to fact-check 
news and opinion articles and correct 
grammar and style? How is that fun for 
anyone?

I didn’t realize how much I wanted 

to be a copy editor until I received the 
email congratulating me that I was in. 
Many of my fellow copy editors walked 
into the newsroom with the intent of 
joining another section — news, opinion, 
sports, arts — with the hopes of actually 
writing articles. I went in knowing the 
only thing I wanted to do was edit them. 
I made a beeline for the copy desk after 

the mass meeting, frantically avoiding 
all the other sections. Now, every time 
I go in for my shift, I make that same 
beeline.

I love words. I love English. And 

the copy desk offered me the perfect 
opportunity to do something I was 
passionate about in a way that I was 
comfortable doing.

But, my anxiety towards article-

writing kept coming back to bite me. 
There was a voice in the back of my head 
— an echo of everyone around me — 
telling me that the work I do is inferior 
to the work I am editing.

Now, I know that voice is full 

of lies. The copy desk, one of the 
quietest sections in the newsroom, is 
my favorite section. There is a much 
underappreciated need for copy editors, 
and I enjoy the work I do. I don’t need 
to be on the frontlines interviewing 
the lead singer or star running back or 
presidential candidate to leave my mark 
on The Daily. In fact, the mark I leave 
from behind the copy desk is arguably 
more important.

But, college really is about getting 

involved and overcoming fears. And 
with that, we are here. I am happy to 
report that I have accomplished the 
one thing I wanted going into college — 
joining the copy desk — but I have also 
accomplished the one thing I wanted to 
avoid going into college — writing for 
The Daily. With this Copy That, I have 
conquered that fear.

There are no objective facts here 

that can be fact-checked, yet they are 
undeniable facts to me. There is no 
strong, controversial opinion here, yet I 
feel strongly about this position.

For some people, Copy Desk is a 

backup option. For many more, Copy 
Desk is misunderstood. For me, Copy 
Desk is right where I belong.

This is my article, one I wrote rather 

than edited. And one article is enough 
for now. Baby steps — even though this 
a giant leap for me.

So, thank you, Copy Desk, for 

giving me everything I wanted — and 
everything I didn’t want as well.

Critical Questions: Who gets to 

say what feminism is?

W

ho gets to define feminism?

With 
contemporary 

feminism 
going 
global 

from its origins as an originally 
1960’s American movement, the way 
various groups absorb — or reject — 
feminism in their own cultures is an 
intriguing subject.

The topic crossed my mind when 

I was attending a career seminar for 
students interested in working in 
Japan. Five of us sat in a small room 
in the Michigan League, listening to 
an agent from a recruiting company 
explain the job search process in Japan.

After the seminar was done, the 

agent asked if we had any questions. 
One female student raised her hand 
and asked how working conditions 
were 
for 
women 
in 
domestic 

Japanese companies versus Japanese 
subsidiaries of foreign companies. The 
agent calmly answered the latter was 
better for women.

I was shocked by the casualness 

of the whole exchange. In the agent 
and student’s voices, there was an 
assumption that the geezer male 
executives in domestic companies 
wouldn’t do anything for women. 
There was also a tone of defeatism. 
To the female attendees, it was an 
immovable fact of life that working as 
a woman in Japan will be subpar when 
compared to men, but it couldn’t be 
helped (or as we like to say in Japan, 
shikata ga nai).

And their attitude is understandable. 

Only 12.1 percent of women in Japan 
are in managerial roles as of the 
2016-17 fiscal year, a far cry from the 
government’s stated objective of 30 
percent by 2020, which they since 
abandoned in 2015. Women are still 
expected to cut their careers short 
when they start having children. The 
Supreme Court of Japan decided in 
2015 that married couples cannot 
legally have separate last names, 
and not to mention the notorious 
groping and molestation on public 
transportation, which in turn is 
fetishized in adult media.

(This isn’t to say Japan is some sort 

of hellish dystopia for women. Though 
it may be lacking when compared to 
Europe and the United States, it still 
fares better than most other countries. 
But 
it’s 
also 
understandable 
that 

Japanese international students, upon 
experiencing the superior conditions 
in the U.S. and especially in liberal Ann 
Arbor, can’t go back to the world they 
knew before.)

I just listed facts lamenting the 

lack of progress for women in Japan, 

but if someone else were to say that 
to me, I would be defensive about it. 
It’s similar to how if some foreigner 
criticized the U.S.’s atrocious record on 
environmental causes or role as world 
police; I know we’re doing terribly and I 
know the criticism wasn’t personal, but 
no one wants to believe their neighbors 
are bad people.

“We live in different cultures,” I’d 

say. “We have our own way of dealing 
with internal issues.” 

This defensiveness, I feel, is an 

obstacle for feminism going forward 
globally.

When Black women became tired of 

middle-class white feminism and the 
male-dominated civil rights movement, 
they created Black and intersectional 
feminism, with the notion that sexism, 
racism, class oppression and gender 
identity are linked together. But can we 
reproduce that on a global scale?

Take female genital mutilation as 

an example. Though women (and men, 
including myself) in the West think 
it’s a horrible and inhumane idea, 
the practitioners may be wondering 

why college-educated white women 
feel entitled to decide what they 
want to do with their child. Indeed, 
some anthropologists have criticized 
Western opposition to FGM as cultural 
imperialism and the imposition of 
Judeo-Christian morals.

Another example would be the 

treatment of women in Islam. Certain 
sections of Islamic texts can be read 
as oppressive to women in a Western 
context: For instance, a section in the 
Quran says that a woman’s testimony 
in court is equal to half of that of a 
man. Many Muslim-majority countries 
follow this custom in some or most 
legal cases. The Quran also explicitly 
states there are only two genders 
in this world, in direct contrast to 
progressive Western ideals.

It is understandable why many 

liberals and feminists are silent on this 
issue; they know Islamophobes and far-
right elements have used this argument 
to 
sow 
division 
in 
multicultural 

societies. But philosophically speaking, 
it does beg the question of why moral 
relativism overrides universal human 

rights in certain areas but not others.

If feminism were to become a truly 

universal movement penetrating people 
of all nations, genders and classes, it 
would need to be able to resolve this 
internal conflict. For feminism is about 
giving all women the freedom to choose, 
but if a woman chooses to live under 
what we in the West call “oppression,” 
would it be acceptable?

Philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote 

in “The Subjection of Women” in 1869 
that men have successfully conditioned 
women’s minds to view oppression and 
subjugation as a form of benevolent 
paternalism. But who are we in the 
West to tell women in other cultures 
that their choice is locked under 
certain invisible constraints set by 
their patriarchs?

As numerous feminist scholars have 

argued over this and haven’t produced 
a universally accepted answer, and 
I am not a woman, I cannot claim to 
answer it.

Who defines feminism? It’s a food 

for thought during Women’s History 
Month.

I

t is hard adjusting here because 
there are so many people who 
do not look like me, and the first 
thing people do is judge me by 

my appearance, my skin color.”

When asked what was the hardest part 

of their first year at the University of 
Michigan, every Black student responded 
with this answer in one way or another.

Your melanin-enriched skin is a target 

you carry with you each day of your life. 
What separates you from the crowd of 
people you pass on the Diag, what makes 
you the only person in your chemistry 
class and what narrows you down to 5 
percent on a campus of about 46,000. 
Your Blackness is something the world 
will never let you forget, especially on a 
campus where there are few spaces for 
your Blackness to be unapologetically 
itself.

However, life was not always like this…
The year is 1979 and the Black popula-

tion is 8 percent at the University, near 
double today’s.

It was a group effort across campus: 

the Black Student Union, the Black Law 
Student Association, the Association of 
Black Social Work Students and Black 
students from the University medical and 
psychology schools. Each organization 
came together to create the Black Action 
Movement (BAM) to manifest change 
for students who faced marginalization 
for their skin color on a daily basis. They 
demanded the University increase the 

Black population to 10 percent, in order 
to reflect the state of Michigan’s Black 
resident population at the time, and to 
overall increase the representation and 
awareness of Black students on campus.

Through strikes that often lasted up to 

a week and protests with students pas-
sionately holding signs and chanting, 
seven years of enraged passion at the 
University’s failure to create a campus for 
students of color were finally recognized. 
Professors canceled classes until stu-
dents’ demands were met and the faculty 
and staff worked to create changes that 
were insisted after years of failure to rec-
ognize their Black students. Lasting from 
1970 to 1987, BAM I, BAM II and BAM 
III progressively worked to increase the 
Black population and bring attention to 
the concerns of harassment, racial ten-
sion and discrimination on campus.

Though the University never did reach 

10 percent enrollment, programs like the 
multicultural lounges in each dorm and 
living/learning communities exclusively 
for Black students arose as a result of the 
BAM movements that took place in the 
early ’80s — places like the Ambatana 
Lounge in South Quad Residence Hall. 
Black students finally had spaces to 
escape from the everyday racism of cam-
pus — spaces just for us.
S

pades, UNO and of course … the 
kid that flipped the Monopoly 
board over because he did not 

want to pay rent to the rest of his oppo-

nents. This was how my parents met.

Long nights in the Ambatana Lounge 

in South Quad. Spontaneous step-shows 
between rival Greek organizations in the 
middle of Angell Hall as students walked 
to class. Soul Train Lines that formed on 
Friday nights in the cafeteria of Mary 
Markley 
Residence 
Hall. 
Basketball 

courts full of late night pick-up games. 
These were unforgettable memories for 
students like my parents. They found 
camaraderie in the living communi-
ties that brought Black students togeth-
er from different parts of the country. 
Through funded trips to attend movie 
premieres and snacks for their lounges 
provided by the council, the Black com-
munity grew closer.

Black history at the University of 

Michigan is complicated, affirmative 
action ended in 2006 and the Supreme 
Court upheld the ban after a momentous 
6-2 vote. The Black population at the Uni-
versity dropped dramatically, and with 
that came the end of an era.

The Black living/learning communi-

ties that created friendships among Black 
students who lived just across the hall 
from each other disappeared. The loung-
es that were once centralized places for 
Black students to easily socialize with 
others of their own community until the 
early hours of the morning slowly grew 
empty. This is a result of the scattering 
of Black students across campus. With 
the loss of the living communities, con-
nections that were formed by living next 
door to one another were broken. It was 
much harder to meet Black people who 
lived in different parts of campus, espe-
cially since the already miniscule num-
ber of students continues to falter. A 
diminishing population could no longer 
sustain the elements that made it home 
for so many.
I 

interviewed a few alumni about 
their experiences at the Univer-
sity. This is what they said:

The Athlete (1999-2003):
“My experience at the University of 

Michigan was different because I was a 
public figure and so people were more 
willing to come up and talk to me than 
what was the case for most of the Black 
community. I was approached and asked 
questions because I was the face for the 
University, for the basketball team. How-
ever, I knew at the end of the day that I 
would always have a community to come 
back to after long days of practice when 
I walked into South Quad. There was 

always someone flipping over a chair 
because they were losing at Spades, and 
I remember those days as being the best 
moments of my college career. ” 

The Sigma (1979-1984):
“Being here from 1979 to 1984 was the 

peak for the Black community, we had 
the largest Phi Beta Sigma pledge line 
the University had ever seen and it was 
exhilarating being a part of something so 
special. Learning the steps and staying 
up late practicing with my Line Brothers, 
the parties, and competitions we used to 
perform in; those are the moments I will 
never forget. I made friends for life dur-
ing my time here, and I wish everyone 
could have a piece of what I had during 
undergrad.” 

The Socialite (1979-1983):
“Although I was not a part of any 

clubs, I had the time of my life here. The 
lounge is where I met my best friends, 
beat people in Spades, and tried to learn 
Calc. Being at the University of Michi-
gan gave me the confidence I needed to 
succeed in the real world. The programs 
in the dorms that created activities for 
the Black kids helped me to find people 
who experienced the world like I did. 
Although, I wish that it was something 
that all minorities had because creating a 
space for people who are marginalized is 
so important in this world.”
T

he lounges remain, but the his-
torical context and the memo-
ries of those who once occupied 

these spaces do not. The multicultural 
lounges now serve as spaces where mem-
bers of non-marginalized communities 
can enter.

With the recent removal of a short 

orientation 
requirement 
for 
use 
of 

multicultural lounges like CAMEO in 
Couzens and the Ambatana Lounge in 
South Quad, the history and camarade-
rie that once centralized Black students 
and other minorities alike is now forgot-
ten. Ambatana, the lounge named for the 
Swahili term “stick together,” has unfor-
tunately lost its meaning when students 
began referring to it as the “Afro-Amer-
ican Lounge.” With the decreased use of 
these lounges by minority students and 
the fear of creating spaces that were “too 
exclusive,” the lounges had to accommo-
date students from the entire campus, 
including those who made us feel unwel-
comed. A door closed on history is now 
silenced by the effort to create inclusive-
ness, but takes away from the meaning of 
what created these safe places, to begin 

with.

Ironically, the most notable differ-

ence is what remains invisible to us all: 
the immense number of kids who were 
denied the opportunity to attend this 
University because affirmative action 
was voted out. Considering that the state 
of Michigan currently has a population 
of 14.2 percent Black/African American 
residents according to the 2017 census 
report, it does not make much sense as to 
why our University’s Black population is 
so small. Black students especially have 
lost the opportunity that they once had 
to attend one of the highest-ranked uni-
versities in the country. For Black stu-
dents like my parents, education paved a 
pathway to a lifestyle outside of the one 
that society fabricated for them. We will 
never know the accomplishments of stu-
dents who were denied the opportunity 
to attend this University: a chilling real-
ity we all need to face.

Efforts to create a community for the 

Black population by the Black Student 
Union, the National Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil and many other Black organizations 
on campus should not be overlooked. For 
example, the screening of “Black Pan-
ther” put on by BSU united Black students 

from around the campus. NPHC events 
highlight the tradition and the impor-
tance of Black Greek life, and academic 
groups like the National Society of Black 
Engineers bring Black engineers together 
in a field that lacks Black representation. 
Without the tireless ventures from these 
programs that help bond the Black stu-
dents at the University of Michigan, we 
certainly would not feel as united.

Black History Month might be over, and 

soon the school year will conclude with 
melting snow and longer days. Before 
we know it, our time as students will 
come to an end. The moments we share 
and relationships we build are a testa-
ment to our community. Simply because 
we know what it means to overcome the 
targets placed on our backs by society 
and the outside world as a whole. Sim-
ply because our journey to defy what has 
been fabricated to deter us will never be 
easy. Simply because having a supportive 
community that unifies us through every 
moment of our journey is imperative to 
our success in a world of homogeneity.

Simply because … We matter.
A special thank you those who were 

interviewed for this piece; without you, 
this would not be possible.

I 

am devoting my first column 
after Spring Break to a friend-
requested 
topic: 
Travel 

etiquette. Many students spent this 
week-long break from classes traveling 
— be it on University-affiliated trips 
like 
Alternative 
Spring 
Break 
or 

definitely-not-University-affiliated 
trips to Cancun or Miami or even just a 
simple trip home filled with sleep and 
pets.

In all of these scenarios, it is likely 

that you traveled in some way, from 
driving to flying. With travel comes 
annoyances from your fellow travelers, 
and if you don’t find other travelers 
annoying, you are either far nicer than 
me or the annoying person yourself.

Am I allowed to recline my seat?
The question of who owns the space 

taken up when reclining a seat on a 
plane or bus is as controversial as 
pineapple on pizza (ew). People spend 
$21.95 on Knee Defenders, which 
prevent people from leaning back 
their airplane seats. However, amid 
controversy, the device was banned by 
many airlines. 

I have heard complaints from many 

friends about the issue of shrinking 
seats and decreasing legroom, but 
since I only stand at 5-foot-3-inches, I 
cannot say that this is a problem I can 

relate to. In fact, I regularly recline 
my seat on airplanes, because why 
wouldn’t I?

If I’m not allowed to recline my seat, 

why is there a button on my armrest? 
And if I have a long flight ahead of me, 
I want to be as comfortable as possible. 
Why would the airplane include this 
feature if I’m not supposed to use it? 
And if the person in front of me wants 
to recline their seat, I welcome them to 
do so.

Of 
course, 
this 
experience 
is 

different for tall people, but there are 
options if the issue is that important 
to you. Pay extra for economy plus or 
exit row seats on airlines that offer it. 
Even if you are traveling on a budget, 
the extra cost is not outrageous. If you 
don’t feel that it is worth the extra cost, 
then remember that you chose not to 
pay extra for more legroom before you 
get angry with someone for reclining 
their seat.

On top of all that, a few hours of 

discomfort is a small price to pay given 
the other benefits of being tall. You can 
reach high shelves, you might be more 
likely to be rich and successful and 
you might be seen as more attractive (I 
would never make it on America’s Next 
Top Model). I’m sorry that in this one 
area you do not get to exercise your tall 

person privilege, but in economy class 
on an airplane, we are all equals in seat 
size and reclining ability.

Who taught you how to walk?
While there isn’t necessarily a right 

way to walk, there are definitely wrong 
ways to walk. So here is a list of things 
that people need to stop doing.

Walking slowly in a group of more 

than two and taking up an entire 
walkway:

Please move or I will rudely shove 

past you, hitting you with my bag 
without remorse. Why do people 
always seem to walk slower in groups? 
@UMichresearch get on this.

Taking up both sides of a moving 

walkway/escalator:

I understand that some people 

have their life together and are not 
constantly late for things, but please 
have mercy on those of us who are 
about to miss our flights and move to 
the side so I can get past. It is a narrow 
space that can fit usually two people, 
so please stand to one side.

Stopping/dramatically 
slowing 

down to look at your phone:

Are you 60 years old? Why do you 

need that much concentration to look 
at your phone? If you cannot maintain 
your velocity and send a text message, 
please move to the side before you look 

at your phone.

How 
about 
you 
manspread 

yourself away from me?

I honestly don’t understand how 

manspreading is still such a large 
issue. You tell women to close their 
legs to solve unwanted pregnancies, 
but you can’t do the same thing? I’m 
talking to you white-haired, tattooed 
man with the scruffy beard on my 
flight over break. And to you, sweaty 
man in shorts that are too short on the 
bus.

Women are stuck cringing and 

sitting on the far side of their seat 
in order to avoid the discomfort 
of 
touching 
some 
strange 
man’s 

leg. Why is this necessary? Is it a 
display of male dominance? Are you 
overcompensating? It’s not even a 
comfortable way to sit.

Just please stop.
Did your infant really enjoy the 

family vacay?

On my flight back to Michigan, I had 

the unfortunate experience of sitting 
near four infants and three toddlers, 
courtesy of five different families. 
Several times I made eye contact 
with the flight attendant in mutual 
understanding that there is nothing 
worse than babies on a plane.

I don’t understand the compulsion 

to bring your young child on vacation. 
They are not going to remember any 
of it, and you are just making the 
trip worse on yourself. Are you really 
enjoying your trip if your child still 
cannot sleep through the night? How 
can you enjoy a beach or sightseeing 
if you have to push a stroller and 
constantly worry about the well-being 
of a small child?

I understand that parenting is 

difficult, but it was your choice to have 
the child. Please do your best to stop it 
from running up and down the aisles 
and screaming for the entire duration 
of the flight. Not everyone finds it cute 
when your unrestrained toddler stares 
at them for an entire two-hour flight.

Please spare the rest of us (and 

likely improve the quality of your own 
vacation) and leave the kid with their 
grandparents during your vacation, 
until they can at least use the bathroom 
and eat on their own.

While most of us will be stuck on 

campus for another few weeks, please 
keep these helpful tips in mind the 
next time your travel. If you do not, 
then know you will be the victim of 
angry stares throughout your journey.

Let’s Bitch About It: Travel etiquette

BY LYDIA MURRAY, COLUMNIST

ILLUSTRATION BY HANNAH MYERS


Dear Michigan Daily Editors,

I am an April 2017 graduate of the 

University of Michigan and four-year 
resident of the Martha Cook Building. 
I read with intense interest Ms. Andrea 
Perez’s article: “An Afternoon Tea: The 
stark traditionalism of Martha Cook 
dorm.” I found the lack of objectivism, 
bias, and complete misrepresentation 
of the Martha Cook dorm breathtaking.

While there exist two other all-

female dorms, as well as countless 
sororities, on the University of Michi-
gan campus, Ms. Perez chooses to 
emphasize Martha Cook’s “distinc-
tive reputation.” From the beginning 
of the article, Ms. Perez’s intent to 
criticize the Martha Cook Building’s 
deeply rooted history and traditions 
is extremely clear. The result is both 
defamatory and insulting.

As a four-year resident of the build-

ing, I can truly say that Martha Cook 
residents are some of the most intelli-
gent, inclusive, and progressive women 
on the University of Michigan campus. 
William Cook intended for the Mar-
tha Cook Building to be governed by 
women. An all-female Board of Gover-
nors continues to run the dorm to this 
day. I am also disappointed that Ms. 

Perez did not discuss the residents’ 
regular involvement in building-wide 
multicultural events, as well as the 
building’s largest event of the year: 
International Tea.

As a prior student journalist, I fully 

endorse Ms. Perez’s right to express her 
opinions about the history of female 
oppression on the University of Michi-
gan campus. However, it is extremely 
inappropriate to falsely depict the 
Martha Cook Building’s residents as 
ignorant and entitled to advance the 
purpose of her article. Additionally, I 
am disappointed that the Daily editors 
did not adequately fact-check or ques-
tion Ms. Perez’s illusory statements 
and conclusions. For instance, Ms. Per-
ez’s description of “baby days” is not a 
Martha Cook tradition, but is generally 
stated in Dr. Yanni’s work.

I wish Ms. Perez luck in her future 

journalistic endeavors.

Best,

Melanie Boskovich
