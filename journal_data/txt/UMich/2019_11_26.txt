For 
the 
last 
time 
before 
her 

retirement in January, The Michigan 

Daily sat down for an interview with 

E. Royster Harper, the University’s 

vice president for Student Life. In the 

interview on Friday afternoon, Harper 

discussed 
IFC-affiliated 
fraternities 

recruiting freshmen against University 

policy, controversy surrounding the 

senior honor society Order of Angell, 

protests against the University’s sexual 

misconduct policy and reflections on her 

20-year career at the University.

The Michigan Daily: A Michigan 

Daily 
investigation 
found 
some 

IFC-affiliated fraternities recruited 

freshmen students against University 

policy. In addition, the investigation 

found that at least one IFC-affiliated 

fraternity used freshmen pledges as 

sober monitors for at least one party 

without these students completing the 

required University training. What 

are potential negative consequences 

of students participating in unofficial 

rush and pledging processes? What 

are potential negative consequences 

of students serving as sober monitors 

without proper training? What does 

University administration plan to do to 

address these issues?

E. Royster Harper: The whole 

point of having the new policy in place 

is to really give first-year students a 

chance to get anchored academically 

and socially. In part because we know 

that when students have more of an 

opportunity to get settled into college, 

they’re less likely to be susceptible 

to behavior that puts them in harm’s 

way. So, I’m deeply disappointed if 

that is actually going on, and we have 

reason to believe that it is going on. 

You can imagine also how ineffective 

and concerning it would be to have 

first-year students acting as sober 

monitors, not likely to approach an 

upperclassman and insist on the kind 

of behavior that causes students to be 

safe, and they’re certainly not likely 

to confront an upperclassmen in a 

fraternity that they want to be a part of. 

So, what we’re trying to do and 

are having conversations about now, 

because we believe in self-governance, 

because we’ve tried to do this work 

with IFC, because we believe that 

they are acting in good faith and 

with integrity. … We are looking at 

and working also with the Nationals 

and with the police about what the 

consequences of this kind of behavior 

will be. There is a process that the 

Greek community uses when there are 

violations of policies and procedures. 

So of course, we will be taking a look 

at that. What the Office of Fraternity 

and Sorority Life is certainly looking 

at is following up on reports that come 

through the hazing hotline. … But I 

want to be careful that I don’t accuse 

them of doing something that they’ve 

not done. So, now the issue is trying to 

figure out, where is the truth?

Wallace House expands fellowship

Program to add 2 positions for journalists from news outlets across the Midwest

The Knight-Wallace Fellowship 

— a program for accomplished 

journalists to study at the University 

of Michigan — has expanded to 

include two fellowship positions 

for leadership of beginning news 

operations in the Midwest. 

Wallace House Director Lynette 

Clemetson said the opportunity, 

housed 
within 
the 
current 

fellowship 
framework 
and 
its 

benefits, will allow project leaders to 

develop outlets focused on bringing 

news to the Midwest. Fellows in the 

new program will work with faculty 

in the University’s Business School 

and Law School and can continue 

to work for their operation from 

Ann Arbor, a responsibility fellows 

normally must forgo during their 

eight months in the program.

“When you look at the Midwest, 

in these areas where things have 

been closing, there hasn’t been 

a rush to to address those voids 

and there hasn’t been a rush in 

funding or attention,” Clemetson 

said. “The repercussions of local 

news disappearing in the Midwest 

are striking and quite serious, and 

things that I think we’ve all been 

feeling socially and politically for 

the past several years.”

Clemetson said the new addition 

to the fellowship program was 

inspired by a report from the Knight 

Center and the University of North 

Carolina, which found growing 

news deserts in the Midwest. The 

report found around one in four 

newspapers in the U.S. have shut 

down or merged since 2004, and 

approximately half of newspaper 

jobs have been terminated in the 

same period. 

Ann Arbor became the first city 

of any size to lose its professional 

daily newspaper in 2009 when the 

Ann Arbor News shut down and 

then merged with the media group 

MLive. The new Ann Arbor News 

now publishes a paper twice-weekly 

and online daily.

Clemetson said Ann Arbor has 

felt the effects of losing one of its 

main sources of news. She said 

she hopes the fellowship allows 

participants 
to 
build 
outlets 

to fill voids left by shuttered 

publications.

Managing Podcast Editor

Monday morning, a group 

of students from the One 

University Coalition and the 

Climate Action Movement 

sent a joint statement to 

University 
of 
Michigan 

administrators, 
making 
a 

series of demands regarding 

equity between U-M’s three 

campuses and moving the 

University towards carbon 

neutrality. 

In response to climate 

issues, 
the 
University 

announced the President’s 

Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality 
in 
February. 

The commission’s goal is to 

provide 
recommendations 

to the University on how to 

achieve carbon neutrality 

through 
collaboration 

between 
students 
and 

faculty. In September, the 

University joined a group of 

Northern American research 

universities in the University 

Climate Change Coalition to 

reach their environmental 

goals.

About a month ago 1U 

and 
CAM 
joined 
forces 

to petition the University 

to divest over $1 billion 

currently invested in natural 

gas and expand the Go Blue 

Guarantee to U-M Flint and 

U-M Dearborn, among other 

items. 

Amytess Girgis, an LSA 

junior 
and 
1U 
activist, 

said the two groups began 

working 
together 
several 

weeks ago, and share many 

of the same goals.

“Both of us have been 

just 
entirely 
admonished 

and 
ignored 
by 
this 

administration,” 
Girgis 

said. “We’ve been promised 

that change will come and 

change has yet to come, 

despite the fact that it’s been 

a year. Neither of us have 

seen any signs of progress.”

Girgis also said some 

of the coalition’s requests 

— expanding the Go Blue 

Guarantee 
to 
Flint 
and 

Dearborn, for instance — 

have been acknowledged by 

the University, yet no action 

has been taken.

“This is something that 

they 
have 
acknowledged 

would be a theoretically 

good thing to do and that 

they have refused to take any 

action on,” Girgis said. “So 

that’s the sole ask, and if the 

University can’t meet that 

ask, then we really have to 

question what its intentions 

are between its words and its 

actions.”

LSA 
junior 
Solomon 

Medintz, 
a 
member 
of 

CAM and columnist at The 

Daily, said another unifying 

factor 
between 
the 
two 

organizations has been their 

attempts to work with the 

University to make change 

happen. Medintz said the 

University has attempted to 

pit activist groups like 1U 

and CAM against each other, 

making it seem as though 

the goals of one group are 

counterintuitive to the goals 

of the other. 

“President 
Schlissel 

actively tried to pit us against 

one another by saying that 

getting to decarbonization 

by 2030 and being a leader in 

climate justice would come 

at the expense of the Go Blue 

Guarantee,” Medintz said. 

“And we are kind of joining 

forces to show that we reject 

that kind of sowing division 

between different 

social 
justice 

organizations.”

Medintz 
said 

the 
University’s 

investment 
of 

its $12.4 billion 

endowment 
in 

controversial 

interests 
is 

troubling to the 

student body.

“Approximately 

8 percent (of the 

endowment) 
is 

invested in natural 

resources, 
and 

natural resources 

is almost entirely 

oil 
and 
gas,” 

Medintz 
said. 

“And 
we 
know 

that for a couple 

of reasons. The 

first is that when 

they’re comparing 

it to what their 

expected returns 

for 
the 
given 
category 

is, 
they’re 
comparing 

it to an energy index. 

And secondly, of the last 

eleven natural resources 

investments made, about 

ten of them are in the oil 

and gas industry.”

In March of this year, 

students 
organized 
a 

sit-in 
at 
the 
Fleming 

Administration 
Building 

and ten protestors were 

arrested. 
Medintz 
said 

this 
incident 
shows 

the 
University 
doesn’t 

truly 
support 
climate 

justice. 
One 
of 
the 

coalition’s 
demands 
is 

for 
administration 
to 

apologize for these arrests.

“I think the University’s 

actions have spoken for 

themselves,” 
Medintz 

said. 
“Back 
in 
March 

they arrested individuals 

who 
were 
peacefully 

protesting and were simply 

requesting a meeting with 

President Schlissel, and 

they have yet to apologize 

for those arrests. Charges 

have yet to be dropped for 

those arrests.”

According to University 

Spokesperson 
Public 

Affairs Rick Fitzgerald, the 

University is committed 

to environmental justice 

initiatives, 
but 
sees 
a 

different 
path 
towards 

carbon 
neutrality 
as 

student activists.

“The 
university 
is 

committed to doing the 

research 
necessary 
to 

support the how so we can 

help not just ourselves but 

others beyond our campus 

also 
become 
carbon 

neutral,” Fitzgerald said. 

”That’s the real benefit 

of a research university 

making a commitment to 

becoming carbon neutral. 

We have the resources to 

figure out how to do it and 

then we can share that 

information with others.”

“People around the country have 

seen local news diminish, from 

daily newspapers to weeklies,” 

Clemetson said. “Even if people 

aren’t specifically paying attention, 

I think it is something that people 

in communities have felt. We 

certainly have experienced that 

here in Ann Arbor, and it’s in 

communities across the country.”

A 
gift 
from 
Ann 
Arbor 

entrepreneurs and philanthropists 

Dug and Linh Song funds the new 

opportunity within the fellowship. 

In addition to the $70,000 stipend 

and subsidized classes, seminars, 

workshops and travel, the two 

fellows will also receive six months 

of consulting support after the 

conclusion of the fellowship.

Clemetson 
described 
the 

Midwestern 
fellowship 
as 
a 

“concentration” within the current 

fellowship structure rather than a 

separate entity. She took inspiration 

from 
her 
own 
experiences, 

specifically 
with 
working 
on 

a startup for The Washington 

Post prior to her Knight-Wallace 

fellowship in 2010, as well as those 

of board members and former 

fellows into account when creating 

the new role.

Clemetson said she tested out 

how one could participate in the 

fellowship 
without 
completely 

stepping away from work. She 

did this with Dayo Aiyetan, a 

former Knight-Wallace fellow who 

serves as the founding executive 

director and editor in chief of 

the 
International 
Centre 
for 

Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit 

investigative 
news 
organization 

based in Nigeria. Aiyetan was able 

to continue completing some of his 

job’s duties while in Ann Arbor.

Aiyetan 
said 
he 
sees 
the 

opportunity as a way for leaders 

of developing journalism ventures 

to 
obtain 
additional 
support, 

while understanding they cannot 

completely step away from their 

operation. Aiyetan said there is 

a risk in jeopardizing the new 

operation’s survival if the leader 

steps away for a long period of time. 

“For newsroom leaders who 

would ordinarily not be able to lead 

their work for one year to come 

for a fellowship in Michigan, this 

is perfect for them so that they 

can be part of the Knight-Wallace 

Fellowship and still be able to do 

some of the work they will do back 

home,” Aiyetan said. “The person 

will partake in all the fellowship 

programs, but for that person it 

will be structured in a way so that 

you go back home and not discover 

that there’s no job for him again, 

because he has spent one year in 

Michigan and he’s lost everything.”

Clemetson said the selection 

committee will judge applicants 

without preference to the medium. 

The goal, she said, is to support new 

operations providing communities 

access to information, regardless of 

the way in which it is delivered.

Additionally, 
she 
noted 
the 

new option is not an incubator for 

ideas for potential news outlets. 

The traditional Knight-Wallace 

fellowship 
program 
allows 

journalists to focus on a long term 

project, which could be developing 

a 
new 
journalistic 
venture. 

However, this new opportunity is 

for leaders of projects already off 

the ground.

Clemetson said communities are 

negatively impacted in many ways 

when news organizations shutter. 

With the majority of journalism 

jobs on the coasts, she noted a 

lack of communication between 

journalists 
and 
community 

members can contribute to distrust 

in the media among Midwesterners. 

She said she hopes the fellowship 

plays a role in changing this 

by bringing new projects and 

journalism jobs into the Midwest.

According to a press release, Amy 

White, director of the Michigan 

Union, said the search for restaurants 

was broad in terms of cuisine, dietary 

considerations, pricing and national 

recognition. 

“When 
looking 
at 
restaurant 

brands we made a very broad request 

for proposals, including both local 

and national brands, so that we could 

consider a variety of cuisines, dietary 

advantages, and price points,” White 

said. “Taco Bell rounds out this diverse 

offering with a mix of options and 

selections to make students, staff and 

guests want to return regularly. We 

are very pleased to welcome Taco Bell 

to the Union.”

Susan Pile, senior director of 

University 
Unions 
and 
Auxiliary 

Services, 
said 
Taco 
Bell’s 

announcement 
comes 
a 
month 

after the rest of the vendors due to 

processing agreements. 

“We can’t make an announcement 

until we have signed agreements with 

each of the respective vendors,” Pile 

said. “This one took a little bit longer 

to actually get signed than the others 

did and lots of people were wanting to 

know who the vendors were going to 

be and we wanted to honor that and 

get the information out that we could 

at the time.”

LSA junior Brianna Morigney said 

she is looking forward to the opening 

of Taco Bell in the Union and thinks it 

offers a better alternative to Wendy’s.

“I am really excited about Taco Bell 

in the Union,” Morigney said. “I think 

it’s a well known, inexpensive and 

fast option that’s great for students. I 

know many people were upset about 

Wendy’s leaving the Union but I think 

Taco Bell is a better replacement and 

will be popular amongst students.”

Taco Bell franchise owner Louis 

Dortch Jr. said in a press release the 

menu offers American Vegetarian 

Association approved items.

“At Taco Bell, we’ve had innovation 

on our mind since Glen Bell started 

serving tacos at the first location in 

1962 in Downey, California,” Dortch 

said. “Since then, we’ve grown to 

be a culture-centric, lifestyle brand 

that provides craveable, affordable 

Mexican-inspired food with bold 

flavors. Not only do we provide 

breakthrough 
value, 
we 
offer 

quality ingredients and are the first 

QSR restaurant to offer American 

Vegetarian Association (AVA)-certified 

menu items. In fact, our restaurant 

brand is one of the very few in the QSR 

industry leading that charge.”

Because there’s two narratives 

out there, one that we’re hearing 

from the fraternities, and one that 

we’re hearing from places like The 

Daily and the hazing hotline and 

other places. So, the first thing we 

have to figure out is what happened, 

because there are two stories.

TMD: In the last few months, 

several 
multicultural 
student 

organizations 
have 
published 

statements publicly condemning 

the senior honor society Order 

of Angell, which they claim is an 

organization historically rooted 

in 
indigenous 
appropriation, 

elitism and secrecy. What are 

your thoughts on the ongoing 

controversy surrounding the Order 

of Angell, especially given you 

were the VP of Student Life during 

the Students of Color Coalition’s 

occupation of the Union Tower in 

2000? 

Harper: 
I’m 
deeply 

disappointed. I feel strongly that 

we have a lot of work to do with 

student organizations who believe 

that it is both legal and their right 

to tell other students or condemn 

members of their organizations 

for other groups that they want 

to be a part of. I think students 

should decide what groups they 

want to be a part of. And that, if 

these are members that care about 

the organization and want to be in 

the organization, that they have a 

right to do that. I think that Order, 

over the years, has looked at its 

history, made changes related to 

this history, changed some of their 

traditions, to reflect the changes 

that they have made. And that to 

continue to not accept that they 

made changes is inappropriate and 

unkind. … And what I have said to 

students who come to me really 

torn about this, who want to be in 

both organizations, I say to them, 

“You have a right to be in both 

organizations.” And I don’t believe 

it’s appropriate for one organization 

to say to another student, “You 

can’t be in my organization,” or to 

shame another student, or call out 

another student, because they have 

multiple interests and multiple 

organizations that they want to be. 

So, we have a lot of work to do.

You also cannot be a sponsored 

student organization and engage 

in 
this 
behavior. 
The 
Center 

for Campus Involvement works 

with student organizations, and 

works to make sure that they have 

policies and procedures that are 

in alignment, that don’t violate 

people’s constitutional rights, that 

you don’t give up just because you 

choose to join an organization. ... 

We just got to keep working with 

the student organizations and this 

sort of calling people out has ebbed 

and flowed. There was a time 

when that was going on, and then 

it stopped, and it sounds like now 

that’s back, the trend, and I think 

it’s unfortunate and wrong. … Our 

work as an institution is to help 

the student organizations come to 

understand and consider a different 

way, and to look at the criteria 

that they’re putting in place that 

I suspect doesn’t have anything to 

do with advancing the mission of 

that organization. Because, I don’t 

see the relationship between what 

some groups are trying to do and 

Order’s prior behavior. 

TMD: We know we asked you 

about the University’s use of cross-

examination in sexual misconduct 

cases during our last interview. 

Since then, students have protested 

on the Diag, continuing to claim 

direct cross-examination between 

the accuser and the accused is 

“cruel.” What is your response to 

these student activists? 

Harper: First of all, of all the 

cases that we’ve had, they’ve all 

been separated. You can be in 

separate spaces, you can do it by 

voice, you can do it by text. So, what 

is being alleged has not happened 

in reality. I am struggling right 

now with pockets of protest where 

the protesters decide what they 

think is best and then impose it 

on others. So, there are some who 

think, “I don’t want a lawyer there, 

I didn’t go to the police because I 

don’t want a court hearing where 

somebody is hammering me, and 

if you make me go through that, 

I’m simply not going to tell you.” 

Numbers of reporting are so low. 

So, what we’ve been trying to think 

about, is there a third truth? Is 

there a way that we can ensure that 

survivors get what they need and 

have a sense of agency? The federal 

government is going to make some 

rules, and we’re going to be bound 

by them, and they’re coming soon. 

So, it may end up being a moot 

point. And the court, we wouldn’t 

be having cross-examination at all 

had the law not forced us to. 

So, what I’d like to say to the 

students who were protesting is 

three things. One: you keep helping 

us get it right. Because what’s right 

for one survivor may not be what’s 

best for another, and we’re trying to 

have a space where survivors’ sense 

of agency is what we’re honoring. 

There is evidence, researchers 

and scholars say what’s being 

imposed on the University and 

imposed on survivors is the worst 

thing we could possibly do. It is 

not something that the University 

chose to do. So, the protest needs 

to be focused on where the power 

and the decision-making is. The 

University’s intent would never be 

to create a process or set of policies 

that harmed the very students that 

we’re trying to make sure get the 

kind of support that they need. 

We’re hearing both narratives, and 

depending on who you talk to, you 

will get just the opposite request. 

And so, how do we individualize 

this? Are there multiple options? 

And more importantly, how do 

we reduce the number of sexual 

assaults 
on 
campus 
and 
get 

students to come forward when 

they are assaulted? How might we 

create options that give students 

a reasonable but multiple ways of 

engaging in the process, without 

expanding the time, honoring due 

process, all of those things we’re 

trying to try and hold in balance?

TMD: Take us back to when you 

first started as VP of Student Life 

at the University. Compared to your 

expectations of the role then, what 

about your time here has been the 

most 
unexpected? 
Challenging? 

Rewarding?

Harper: I think for me, the most 

rewarding has been to work with 

students and to see over time how 

that has changed and to see how 

some of the things that students 

have really wanted to make this 

place more supportive and better 

for them has happened. Our new 

Multicultural Center, the changes 

in housing, the fact that we do have 

alternative resolution for students. 

The fabulous Union that’s going to 

open, the number of scholarships 

that are available, the fact that 

we have a program for students in 

foster care (Blavin Scholars), all of 

those things that have changed in 

these 19 years to make this place 

more affordable and accessible 

for a broader range of students. 

That’s probably what has brought 

me the most joy, to see many more 

different kinds of students here 

and them thriving and doing well. 

I think a big change has been 

students expectations about what 

the University will do or provide. 

Probably for me the hardest, has 

been, I think, as an institution, we 

get better and better, and I guess I 

want an acknowledgement that we 

are better than what we were. And 

yet, I know students only know, 

it’s only what they get that they 

really know and understand. And 

when you’ve been around a while 

you’ve seen the changes. I know 

our support of survivors is much 

stronger than what it used to be. 

I am proud of the fact that this is 

a responsive administration, that 

students’ protests are important 

and they shape the University 

and help shape policy. This is a 

University that responds to our 

students, that expects them to look 

for ways that we can get stronger 

and better, and then we respond to 

those. 

If I had a wish … it would be that 

our faculty, staff and students could 

see ourselves more as one. And 

the problem is something we’re 

working on. So, if IFC is taking in 

first-year students and hurting 

them, we all need to be upset about 

it. We all need to be saying, “Don’t 

put a sign out for the Michigan, 

Michigan State game that harms 

and makes fun for people that have 

been harmed.” Don’t do that. That’s 

not who we are. So, it’s a little bit 

more of us caring enough for each 

other, to be honest about those 

things that are in violation of our 

values.

Against buzzword politics
I

n recent years, several trends have 

defined American politics: the rise of 

populism, exacerbated polarization 

and talks of impeachment, to name a 

few. A less frequently discussed trend, 

however, is the proliferation of buzzwords 

and empty rhetoric in political discourse. 

The rise of “buzzword rhetoric” cheapens 

our political discourse and impedes policy 

formation. If left unaddressed, buzzword 

rhetoric could fundamentally change the 

way this nation debates and discusses 

politics for the worse, and its effects 

could linger long after the current wave of 

populism recedes.

As with many trends in today’s politics, 

buzzword 
rhetoric 
is 
embraced 
by 

President Donald Trump. Trump has never 

been known for his eloquence or detailed 

policy proposals, but he is especially prone 

to using buzzwords. Trump regularly 

dismisses opposing ideas and inconvenient 

realities as “fake news” — in the first year 

of his term, he averaged one “fake news” 

or related variation every day. When 

confronted with specific policy issues or 

challenges, Trump habitually distorts 

the issue at hand with inflammatory 

buzzwords. Immigration at the southern 

border is referred to as an “invasion” and 

trade agreements are reduced to zero-

sum games where America is “winning” 

or “losing.” Special interests and neutral 

career bureaucrats are lumped together as 

“The Swamp,” and Democratic opponents 

are accused of being a part of “The Deep 

State.”

On many matters Trump can be 

considered an anomaly, but Trump’s 

proclivity for buzzwords is shared by many 

of his fellow conservatives. In response 

to criticism for his blocking of election 

security measures, Senate Majority Leader 

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused his critics 

of “McCarthyism.” Ironically, McConnell 

accused critics of diminishing “our ability 

to debate public policy” despite being 

the one who responded to policy-specific 

criticism with grandstanding.

Another prime example is the right’s 

effort to paint Democrats as “socialists.” 

The 
conservative 
campaign 
to 
link 

Democrats to socialism is nothing new — 

Barack Obama was regularly denounced 

as a socialist — but the campaign was 

reinvigorated by the rise of progressive 

politicians like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 

and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. 

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. To be 

fair, some of these left-wing figures do 

embrace the label of “democratic socialism,” 

but equating progressive proposals, such as 

universal health care and higher taxes on 

the wealthy, with the brutal collectivism of 

communist regimes is both inaccurate and 

irresponsible.

There are plenty of legitimate criticisms 

of progressive proposals — such as their cost, 

efficiency and efficacy — but these critiques 

are usually voiced by the center-left rather 

than conservatives. Regardless of the merits 

of progressive policies, the blanket dismissal 

of these policies as “socialist” lacks nuance 

and fails to address the policy issues that 

these proposals respond to.

Of course, the usage of buzzword rhetoric 

is not exclusive to conservatives. Trump 

critics frequently slip into using buzzwords 

and hyperbole when denouncing his policies 

and conduct. Former Massachussetts Gov. 

Bill Weld, a Libertarian and Republican 

presidential candidate, accused Trump 

of treason in response to revelations that 

Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine 

in order to pressure Ukraine’s president 

to investigate former Vice President Joe 

Biden. The Constitution defines treason 

narrowly as waging war against the United 

States or assisting U.S. enemies in wartime. 

Trump’s request abused power, spawned an 

impeachment probe and likely constitutes a 

crime, but it was not treason, as Weld had 

implied.

O

n Sept. 7, 2018, the U.S. 

Sixth Circuit Court of 

Appeals ruled in the Doe 

v. Baum case that the University of 

Michigan must allow and mandate 

“live 
cross-examinations” 
in 

sexual misconduct cases where the 

accused could face suspension or 

expulsion or where the accuser’s 

credibility 
is 
disputed. 
The 

interim policy has been in effect 

since January 2019, but instead of 

having an attorney perform cross-

examination, it is the accused 

interrogating the accuser. It was 

not mandated by the court that the 

cross-examinations happen this 

way.

Since January, the interim policy 

has been protested. In September 

2019, the American Civil Liberties 

Union sent a letter to the University 

calling on the University to change 

the sexual misconduct policy to 

adhere to Title IX and due process 

by having the cross-examination 

performed by a lawyer, not an 

accused student. The ACLU claims 

that by having an alleged abuser 

conduct the cross-examination, it 

discourages reports, re-traumatizes 

those who do report and creates 

a “hostile campus environment.” 

Since the letter, the University has 

still not changed its policy. While 

the University does have a student 

advisory committee in place, the 

committee has not made any lasting 

changes to the interim policy, as 

it has been in effect for almost 

a year with no changes made. 

Students are in danger of becoming 

re-traumatized.

Beyond the ACLU, University 

students have protested the policy. 

I spoke with LSA sophomore Emma 

Sandberg, an aspiring public policy 

student, about her non-profit Roe 

v. Rape. The non-profit aims to 

help survivors heal through their 

activism. Sandberg has “met with 

countless administrators” to discuss 

the University’s policy and work 

to change it. Roe v. Rape’s goals 

are to have the University change 

the requirements and have the 

cross-examination conducted by 

professionals and for the University 

to cover the costs for attorneys. This 

way, regardless of their financial 

situation, both parties will have 

equal representation.

Cross-examination 
by 
an 

attorney is by no means a good 

solution. The process can be 

re-traumatizing, with the purpose 

being to find damning discrepancies. 

An attorney will know how to ask 

more cutthroat questions than 

the accused. The questions will 

be brutal, and the process will 

likely be longer. However, at least 

it is not the accused doing the 

cross-examination. 
Reporting 

is already traumatic, and an 

investigation even more so. But 

cross-examination performed by 

the accused heightens trauma. 

According to Roe v. Rape, survivors 

on and off campus have stated it 

would be “far more traumatic to be 

cross-examined by their assailants 

than by attorneys.”

As a survivor, the idea of not only 

facing my assailant but being cross-

examined by him is beyond belief. I 

never reported, much less went to 

court against him, but the thought 

of even being in the same room 

as him is disturbing and causes 

anxiety. I cannot fathom having 

to be cross-examined by him, and 

those who have had to go through 

it should be commended for their 

bravery. 

Healing from sexual assault is 

not just physical. The emotional 

healing process takes months 

and years to recover from. Even 

without reporting or seeing their 

abuser 
again, 
sexual 
assault 

survivors 
face 
shock, 
denial, 

depression, guilt, shame and anger. 

Furthermore, post-traumatic stress 

disorder can develop, as well as 

general fear and panic. With these 

emotions, other symptoms include 

flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety 

and depression.

Even though the court mandated 

the 
live 
cross-examination 
of 

survivors, the University can and 

should make it as comfortable 

as possible for the survivors. 

Cross-examination is going to be 

traumatic whether it is an attorney 

or the accused performing the 

cross-examination. 
However, 

it will be even more traumatic 

if the accused is doing it. Cross-

examination will force the accuser 

to relive the assault in distinct 

detail as their story is questioned 

over and over again. While the 

University does allegedly offer 

the cross-examination to be done 

using technologies like Skype, 

this does not necessarily make the 

cross-examination less traumatic 

or 
painful 
for 
the 
survivor. 

Furthermore, even through Skype, 

survivors still have to communicate 

with their assailant. They have to 

see their assailant’s face, and they 

have to listen to the questions and 

defend their trauma to the very 

person who perpetuated it, all in 

hopes of obtaining justice. 

Whether through Skype or 

in-person, 
this 
is 
traumatic. 

Moreover, 
it 
is 
unnecessary. 

By either providing attorneys 

or covering the legal costs, the 

University can still adhere to 

the court’s mandate while also 

adhering to Title IX and due 

process. While providing legal aid 

obviously costs money, it would 

be money well and fairly spent. 

Additionally, 
providing 
legal 

assistance will benefit both parties 

as it relieves them from the financial 

stress of the situation. Despite the 

fact that University of Michigan 

students live in an expensive city, 

the student population is financially 

diverse. Not everyone can afford 

lawyers, but in investigations like 

sexual misconduct and assault, 

both parties deserve equal legal 

representation to ensure the trial’s 

equity. 

The current sexual misconduct 

policy has been in place for almost 

a year. It is time the University 

reforms 
the 
policy. 
Enough 

is enough. In the meantime, 

remember to continue to support 

survivors. Support can be shown in 

a myriad of ways: listening to and 

believing their stories, providing 

resources, giving them space, 

respecting 
confidentiality 
and 

educating yourself about sexual 

violence. Do not pressure them 

to report. Reporting is not the 

responsibility of survivors; healing 

is. Instead, resources provided 

can be national or local, on or off 

campus and survivors can choose 

whether or not to utilize them.

Beyond supporting a specific 

person, you can show support by 

continuing to educate yourself, 

joining groups like the ACLU and 

even attending protests to show 

your allyship. A benefit of our large 

campus is that there are multiple 

ways to get involved even for one-

time events. We, as students, do not 

have to quietly allow poor policies 

to continue. Through education 

and protest, we can convince the 

University to reform the policy. 

It takes time and passion, but the 

The University’s damage to sexual assault survivors

Multiple pieces to the puzzle of our economy
W

e are officially less than one 

year away from the 2020 

presidential 
elections, 
and 

voters across the country are watching 

candidates as they talk about critically 

important issues: health care costs, job 

opportunities and wages. One of the biggest 

splits among Democrats and Republicans, 

and even between different wings of the 

Democratic party, is the economy. 

Many Republicans and other supporters 

of President Donald Trump have been 

using the economy as proof that, despite 

being unconventional and constantly mired 

in 
controversy, 
Trump 
is 
successfully 

accomplishing the goals he set out to 

accomplish in 2016. Democrats, however, tell 

a different story — a story of wealth inequality 

and an economy that is only benefiting a small 

number of Americans.

The main disconnect comes from the fact 

that “the economy” is an ambiguous term — 

one whose definition changes depending on 

how you look at it. So both sides can technically 

be correct, but who is telling the more complete 

picture and how can we measure it?

Traditionally, measuring the health of 

the economy uses statistics surrounding 

gross domestic product and GDP growth, 

commonly called the growth rate. This simply 

tracks and measures GDP over time for the 

entire country, broken down into quarterly 

reports, to see how the economy as a whole is 

growing or shrinking. President Trump has 

been vocal about the success of the economy, 

and often uses the growth rate as his only 

evidence. Indeed, the growth rate in the U.S. 

has been steadily positive since Trump took 

office in 2017. Over his first term, the growth 

rate is about 3.1 percent — an impressive 

number to be sure, though much smaller than 

the 5 to 6 percent goal Trump promised while 

on the campaign trail. 

As it turns out, however, the picture of our 

economy’s health is actually more complicated 

than President Trump advertises. While total 

GDP may be up, that growth is almost entirely 

concentrated on the top-earners in the 

country and is not shared among the majority 

of Americans. This is the fundamental flaw 

in only observing the growth rate: GDP as a 

measure of the economy’s health only looks 

at total growth in the economy, and therefore 

paints an incomplete story. To find the whole 

story, we need to look at other indicators.

For example, one important statistic that 

impacts all Americans is income inequality. 

Income inequality is the measure of how 

wealth is divided among different percentile 

earners. Unfortunately, in the U.S., income 

inequality has become a serious problem. 

According to Bloomberg News, the richest 

1 percent of earners in the U.S. are about 

to surpass the entirety of the middle class 

— meaning all of the middle class’s wealth 

combined will be less than the wealth of the 

top 1 percent.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

As a video game critic, I’ve been exposed 

to more games than the average player. I 

play games that were masterfully crafted 

by the best in the industry. Games that are 

lethally boring and riddled with bugs. I 

play fast-paced games that test my reaction 

speed. I play slow games that require 

critical thinking. Violent or passive, indie 

or big-budget, I’ve had my fair share of 

experiences. Yet despite all the games 

I’ve played throughout the years, there’s 

one type of game that I always find myself 

coming back to: esports. 

The term esports denotes a very loose 

category. Its definition has changed in 

recent years, but most games classified 

as esports follow a similar convention: 

They are always competitive multiplayer 

games contained within the duration of 

a match. The rules are flexible enough 

where players can employ several different 

strategies to win, and matches take place on 

predetermined “maps.” They typically do 

not have narratives or worlds to explore, and 

if they do contain characters there is very 

little development. Esports can span many 

genres including fighting, real-time strategy 

and first-person shooting. Currently, games 

like Fortnite, Overwatch and League of 

Legends dominate the esport scene.

Though I try to diversify my gaming 

palette, I routinely find myself coming back 

to Overwatch, even though the game is now 

over three years old. There’s something 

timeless about esports that just doesn’t apply 

to traditional games. Like traditional sports, 

esports are constantly in flux. No single 

match will ever be the same as the last. 

One person’s approach to the game might 

be completely different than another’s. But 

does that make esports necessarily better 

than traditional games? I would argue that 

esports are not fundamentally superior 

to other games, but their design is more 

impressive. 

The medium of video games is different 

from other art forms, and its most unique 

feature is interactivity. Unlike passive 

artforms such as music and film, the player is 

involved in the art and actively engages with 

it to reveal its meaning. What the player can 

and cannot do effects their experience with 

the game. In essence, the manipulation of 

interactivity is game design. 

Now apply this logic to an esport. The 

designer crafts interactivity to fit the 

confines of the game. The designer must 

consider the objective, the many ways the 

player can reach that objective, and, most 

importantly, how other players will either 

assist or inhibit them. Since the game is 

meant to be competitive, the designer must 

make everything balanced so no player has 

an advantage over another player. Because 

the designer doesn’t know how the player 

will interact with the game, making an 

esport is the art of creating affordances 

rather 
than 
curating 
an 
experience. 

Designers aren’t telling the player what to 

do or giving them a straight path; instead, 

they are hinting at what is possible and 

letting the player figure it out. 

Compare this to a traditional game 

where the objective is clear and the level 

can only be beaten one way. Even if there 

are multiple approaches, the experience is 

linear. The player interacts with the game as 

the designer intended and follows the path 

created for them. 

There’s nothing wrong with a traditional 

game; in fact, many of my favorite games 

are traditional narrative based games. 

For instance, take God of War, which won 

Game of the Year in 2018. Critics hailed 

it as a masterpiece and many considered 

it a perfect example of how sophisticated 

video games have become. The game had 

narrative complexity exploring themes such 

as fatherhood and grief. 

Yet despite all the acclaim, if one looks 

at the actual design, God of War is simple 

compared to games like Overwatch. The 

experience is mostly linear, with the player 

following the story and interacting with the 

game mostly through fighting. Narrative 

games like God of War are essentially 

interactive films. The focus is on the story 

with the interactive elements only serving 

to augment the experience. Narrative games 

can easily be movies and still retain their 

artistic message. In contrast, esports have 

to be video games because the message they 

convey is exclusive to the medium. The art is 

the interaction between team members and 

their opponents, requiring the viewer to be 

active to appreciate its beauty. 

All games are valuable and the message 

they share has merit regardless of the genre. 

However, esports garner respect because 

their design is most true to the medium. 

Games are meant to be interactive. Thus, I 

will always consider games that encourage 

interaction to be masterpieces.

I have something to admit. I may be 03 

Greedo’s biggest fan. He’s my most-listened-

to artist of all time, according to Last.fm 

and Spotify. Ever since I first heard “Mafia 

Business” on Vince Staples’s SEABS radio 

show back in 2016, I’ve been hooked. I can’t 

get enough. Something about Greedo and his 

style just resonates with me. He used to rap 

over only his own rudimentary Frooty Loops 

experimentations and, somehow, it worked. His 

voice isn’t the best and the bars are pedestrian 

at best (and non-existent at worst), but he has 

endless charm and creates an atmosphere that 

no one else can. Greedo describes his music as 

“emo music for gangbangers,” suggesting he 

makes music that will resonate with everyone, 

even the most hardened individual. He’s 

often pigeonholed into the “so bad it’s good” 

category of rap a 

la Blueface and 

Lil B, but I have to 

disagree with that 

sentiment. Greedo 

can’t 
play 
any 

instruments, is an 

unconventional 

vocalist and barely 

a 
producer, 
but 

he has a musical 

mind. He knows 

what 
he 
wants 

and knows how 

to 
execute 
his 

vision. So when I 

heard Greedo was 

collaborating with 

Kenny Beats, the nascent producer known for 

perfectly executing his clients’s visions, I knew 

I was in for a treat.

Netflix & Deal is Greedo’s second full-length 

(and fourth overall) release since he was 

sentenced to prison for 20 years for firearm 

possession and drug trafficking. With such 

a bleak future looming, Greedo kicked into 

overdrive, recording vast amounts of high-

quality music to ensure that his family would 

be supported while he is locked up, and the 

final products have been nothing short of 

phenomenal. His collaborators really care 

about preserving Greedo’s vision and are 

willing to take any measures necessary to do so. 

From the get-go, Greedo is deep in his bag. 

“Traffic” is textbook Greedo. His froggy voice 

slinks across a cosmic CaptainCrunch-assisted 

Kenny beat like liquid mercury. Greedo bends 

his voice at will, switching from staccato 

bursts to limitless croon with ease. Every 

vocal inflection is unexpected and wonderful, 

perfectly in time with the rumble of an 808. His 

dreamy flow provides an interesting contrast to 

lines about his rough upbringing. His unease 

and weariness are palpable as he warbles lines 

like “Crippin’ with the war wounds, told my 

momma I was tired of cartoons / Jumped off 

the porch / I’m in the field, call the same with 

the rings and the torch” and “Either you get 

killed, go to jail or have a jump spot / Focus 

on your skills, boy, you know you only got one 

shot.”

If “Traffic” was Greedo in his comfort 

zone, “Disco Shit” is him at his most creative. 

Kenny provides what may be one of his most 

surprising beats, defined by disco-inspired 

keys and off-kilter bass hits, and Greedo brings 

the firepower. He doesn’t rap much here, 

instead opting to sing with pure soul, littering 

it with references to “Blow,” his all-time 

favorite movie. Despite Greedo and Kenny’s 

outstanding performances, Freddie Gibbs, 

another Kenny Beats regular, steals the show. 

Gibbs’s voice is drenched in autotune, yet he 

still raps with surgical precision, starting with 

sing-song, T-Pain-

esque flow which 

quickly 
returns 

to his trademark 

spitfire delivery.

With 
such 
a 

strong 
opening 

run, 
it 
seems 

inevitable 
that 

Netflix & Deal will 

eventually 
lose 

steam and land as 

yet another front-

loaded 
hip 
hop 

release. Not the 

case. Kenny and 

Greedo 
display 

their unparalleled 

chemistry across the entire album, and the 

album’s guests bring their A-game, too. 

How could they not? Sharing a track with a 

personality like Greedo demands it. Notably, 

Maxo Kream softens his typically gritty and 

grizzly style on “Beg Your Pardon.” However, 

03 Greedo shines brightest when it’s just him 

and Kenny Beats. 

On “Life,” Greedo elevates. It’s the full 

package. He’s charismatic, emotional and 

sentimental on this track, thanks to Kenny 

pulling a sample of Dire Straits’s “Sultans of 

Swing” out of left field. Greedo tackles matters 

regarding his lifestyle and life choices, his 

friends and family and his accomplishments. 

The track feels a bit like a bittersweet victory 

lap when Greedo’s circumstances are taken 

into consideration, an idea that aligns well with 

the chorus: “Feelin’ like Carly Rae, they offerin’ 

all the days / They tried to say that I had a lil 

baggage I might make the holidays / I’m flyin’ 

all the time, I done did all the crime / Life, life, 

life made me lose my mind.” Greedo knows he’s 

down now, but that’s a part of life’s ebb and 

flow. He’ll be back on top soon.

The story of William Evans’s poetry collection “We Inherit 

What the Fires Left” is one caught not only between generations 

but also between worlds. He remembers the struggle of growing 

up in a rough urban neighborhood which left him with scars and 

trauma, and he cannot help but compare 

it to the childhood his daughter is living. 

These comparisons are frank without 

feeling cheap, because Evans has a real 

talent for making the mundane special. 

He excels at showing the reader how the 

smallest, seemingly insignificant things 

put an entire life into perspective. Right in 

the beginning of the book, his daughter’s 

frequent nosebleeds become a metaphor 

for the way his life has changed in just a 

few short decades. For his daughter, the 

blood is “perfectly natural,” but he does 

not “remember anything natural about 

(his) own blood.” In the same poem 

where he recalls physical punishment for 

his childhood disobedience, Evans thinks 

about how older generations would feel 

about his life now — they would think 

“we’re too soft.” 

Evans clearly struggles with trauma 

from his past and survivor’s guilt about 

his present. After he “watched cemeteries grow fat on his 

friends,” how could he live his normal life with his wife and his 

daughter? His poems are haunted by the ghosts of people he 

lost in his childhood. He mourns their premature deaths, not 

by saying “they died still children” but instead “we put enough 

potential into / the ground to make a college of prayers.” Honest 

and poetic, Evans contemplates the effect his childhood has on 

his life now: “You know / the world wants to hollow you out 

because you / loved someone that was once your age and now / 

they no longer have an age.” He has countless ways to describe 

death like it is something completely new. Evans strips away all 

of the previous constructions around death and makes it raw 

again.

Despite the emphasis on death, Evans’s 

book does not deal solely with sadness — 

it is too full of hope for it to be just a sad 

book. His deep grief is counterbalanced 

by a profound wonder and love for his 

daughter. Where his childhood friends 

died young, his daughter flourishes with 

an innocence Evans never had. In a way, 

she is a channel for Evans to recreate a 

childhood filled with more joy and less 

fear than his own. Like any father, he sees 

himself in her: “she is already my mimic 

after all, / having taken my nose / and 

eyes and smile for her own.” In poems full 

of death and melancholy, his daughter 

punctures through with radiance and 

expectation.

Evans’s daughter is most often a motif 

that weaves throughout the poems in this 

collection, stringing them together, but 

sometimes she gets a poem all to herself, 

like “Clean.” This poem, and the others like it, reads like pure 

happiness distilled into a few stanzas. Evans’s love is so apparent 

he never even needs to use the word love; instead, he can call 

her “the atomic girl / who laughs at everything” or “a brand-

new sun.” He trusts the reader to understand that his love is 

more than a word or a realization and is instead a culmination 

of many little moments. These poems remind the genre why it 

continues to write about love and death when those subjects 

have been discussed millions of times over — because people 

like Evans continue to make us feel them in new and different 

ways. 

Even in a book defined by its skillful handling of emotions, 

Evans still manages to impress with his mastery of poetic form. 

He frequently varies his style, switching from long lines with 

no stanza breaks throughout an entire poem to curt, choppy 

lines split into small stanzas. The resulting effect is a poetry 

collection that keeps readers on their toes, never knowing what 

poetic voice Evans will seamlessly slip into next. He is also able 

to manipulate form to serve the emotional goal of a poem, from 

short lines of similar length to create a visual of conformity 

in “How to Assimilate” to strange caesuras and enjambments 

to create the scatter-brained visual of raising an infant in 

“Descendant.” Evans may tackle ambitious subjects, but his 

dexterous use of language and emotion makes his book stand 

out. He somehow manages to make anew the timeless topics of 

race and familial love in a way that deserves to be heard.

The old made new in ‘We Inherit What the Fires Left’

EMELIA FERRANTE
Daily Arts Writer

A few weeks ago Disney+ was released. Viewers 

young and old alike flocked to the streaming service, 

bingeing everything from “Mulan” to “Avengers: 

Endgame.” I was one of them. My sister texted the 

family group chat that morning, saying that she’d 

purchased it and we were all welcome to mooch. So 

I powered up my laptop and logged in. 

Scrolling past the smiling princesses, steeled 

Jedi and armored heroes, I couldn’t help but feel a 

vague sense of guilt. This continued as I clicked on 

“The Mandalorian,” the new Star Wars TV show, 

and started to watch. As the bounty hunter began 

an epic stellar quest, my heart wasn’t fully in it. It 

almost felt like I was cheating on someone. In a 

sense, I was.

Between me, my family and my friends, there 

have to be at least a dozen streaming services I can 

use. I didn’t feel bad about neglecting HBO Go, 

Hulu or Netflix, though. It was the only streaming 

service that I actually pay for that I felt bad about 

ignoring — the Criterion Channel. 

The Criterion Collection, a long running 

compilation of what its website calls “important 

classic and contemporary films,” launched this 

streaming service last summer. It collects movies 

from across the world and throughout history, and 

of every genre imaginable. They all share one thing: 

They exemplify cinema in the best sense of the 

word. 

The Criterion Collection restores classic movies 

to high definition, which blew me away when I saw 

1954’s “Godzilla,” the first film I choose to watch on 

the service. The restoration was immaculate, and 

the images and soundtrack were pristine. It filled 

me with wonder, how those seeing it must have felt 

when it was first released. 

Next, I chose “Don’t Look Back,” a restored 

version of D.A. Pennebaker’s famous 1964 Bob 

Dylan documentary, which contains one of the first 

music videos of all time. Next was “Antichrist,” a 

deeply unsettling experimental film by Lars Von 

Trier about a husband and wife turning on one 

another in the middle of the woods. 

Now, I admit it may be difficult to consider 

this channel as an entertainment choice. It seems 

more like education, after all. Outside of a Russian 

film class, who would choose Tarkovsky’s bleak, 

impenetrable three-hour “Stalker” over the surefire 

thrills of “The Force Awakens?” Even I wouldn’t, 80 

percent of the time. That isn’t to say the channel is 

unnecessary, though. Quite the opposite.

The Criterion Collection offers a vital alternative 

to 
the 
binge-worthy 
entertainment 
offered 

everywhere else. It invites one to think about what 

they watch, engaging with cinema as an art form. 

While most of the movies aren’t the easiest to watch, 

understand or enjoy, there is much worth seeing. 

A notable example is “Fitzcarraldo,” the 

three hour magnum opus of Werner Herzog, a 

famous German auteur. It’s about an early-20th-

century man who tries to pull a steamboat up an 

Amazonian mountainside to sail to the rubber fields 

beyond. While this sounds like a difficult, maybe 

insurmountable quest, the film’s production is 

almost worse.

The collection also offers a documentary 

companion called “Burden of Dreams” about the 

many perils of making “Fitzcarraldo,” such as when 

a crew member was bitten by a poisonous snake and 

had to chop his leg off with a chainsaw. 

At one point, director Werner Herzog notes in 

his famous German drawl, “The trees here are 

in misery, and the birds are in misery… they just 

screech in pain.” Needless to say, you won’t find 

“Fitzcarraldo” on Disney+.

‘M’ men’s hoops off to Bahamas for first road trip of the season

Three weeks into this watershed 

season, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team sits at 4-0. 

The Wolverines’ performances 

have varied from a late-game scare 

in the opener to Appalachian State 

to two blowouts against lowly 

mid-majors Houston Baptist and 

Elon, with a solid victory against 

Creighton sandwiched in between. 

If there’s been one common 

denominator between all of these 

games though, it’s the location. 

Michigan has yet to play outside the 

confines of Crisler Center. 

That all changes on Wednesday, 

when the Wolverines tip off against 

Iowa State in the first-round of the 

Battle 4 Atlantis in Nassau, Bahamas. 

For Michigan — a program 

very much in transition with new 

coach Juwan Howard and a slew of 

underclassmen playing key roles — a 

trip to the Bahamas may seem like 

the last thing it needs. Having home-

court advantage has likely helped 

the Wolverines slip past the Bluejays, 

and maybe even the Mountaineers, 

unscatched. 

Ask anyone around the team 

though, and they’ll tell you it’s quite 

the opposite. Michigan is relishing 

the chance to leave Ann Arbor 

behind for a few days. 

“We’re gonna be on the road for the 

first time away from our home crowd 

so it’s gonna be a little different,” 

said junior forward Isaiah Livers. 

“I think it’s gonna be exciting. I’m 

excited to see how Coach Howard 

treats a ‘business trip,’ as he calls it.”

“It’s that simple,” Howard said. 

“Bahamas 
is 
Bahamas. 
We’re 

approaching it like we’re gonna take 

care of business.”

In order to accomplish that goal, 

Michigan will have to knock off a 

number of high-profile programs. 

Iowa 
State, 
North 
Carolina, 

Gonzaga, Seton Hall and Oregon 

make up a stacked field, with four of 

them in the AP Top-25. Still though, 

Howard and his coaching staff isn’t 

expecting a drop-off. 

“To a man I’m looking for our 

group to be a competitive group,” 

Howard said. “We know that every 

opponent we’re gonna face is good, 

just like the opponents we face here 

at home. It’s only gonna prepare us 

for the Big Ten season, which is right 

around the corner.”

Not only will the Wolverines face 

better competition than they have 

thus far, they’ll have less than a day 

to prepare for each. 

In typical early-season fashion, 

Michigan has had three or more days 

between each of its first four games 

— before Creighton and Houston 

Baptist, it had an entire week. 

Projecting forward though, the 

Wolverines won’t have the benefit 

of such gaps. From their perspective 

though, they might as well acclimate 

to it now. 

“We 
prepare 
for 
it,” 
said 

sophomore forward Colin Castleton. 

“It’s just something you gotta be 

used to. All the other teams do it, just 

like us, so we gotta just be ready and 

prepare for and practice every day. 

So it’s just like, go out there and 

play.”

Added Howard: “One game at 

a time, we understand that we 

cannot be hanging out at the beach 

enjoying the fun in the sun. I truly 

wish (we’d) have that moment, but 

when we get there, we’ll have that 

practice and start locking in for our 

opponents.”

Teams like Michigan partake in 

these types of tournaments in order 

to test itself against high-caliber, 

non-conference opponents. While, 

the Wolverines might not win the 

Battle 4 Atlantis, they’ll be reaping 

the benefits later on. 

“It’s beautiful when you go 

on the road,” Howard said. “It 

really helps your team form that 

mental toughness as well as that 

togetherness. I think that’s a perfect 

opportunity for us at a perfect time 

where we can bond, get to know one 

another.”

Junior forward Isaiah Livers scored 24 points in Michigan’s 111-68 win over Houston Baptist on Friday, the final tune-up before the Wolverines head off to the Bahamas.

Power-play tweaks end streak without a man-advantage goal

Nick Blankenburg looked across 

the ice, surveying his options as 

he decided which play to make for 

Michigan’s top power-play unit.

The sophomore defenseman had 

senior forward Will Lockwood in 

the slot, senior forward Jake Slaker 

on the right half-wall, fifth-year 

forward Jacob Hayhurst on the left 

half-wall and freshman forward 

Johnny Beecher at the net front. 

He could pass to any one of those 

options or choose to shoot the puck 

himself — less of an attempt to score 

and more of an attempt to make 

the New Hampshire penalty killers 

respect him as an option to shoot.

Blankenburg 
looked 
first 
at 

Lockwood sliding into the slot, who 

brought a defender with him as he 

read Blankenburg’s eyes. In a split 

second, Blankenburg turned slightly 

to his left and fired a tape-to-tape 

pass across to Hayhurst.

Hayhurst, all alone on the left 

wall, quickly moved the puck inside 

for Lockwood, who sent it ahead 

for Beecher in front of Wildcat 

goaltender Mike Robinson.

Beecher tipped the puck out of 

the air to himself and poked it home 

for the Wolverines’ first power-play 

goal in 15 attempts across five games.

“Power play hasn’t been very 

good this year at times, but tonight 

I thought it was excellent,” said 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson after 

Friday’s game. “That was a huge 

power play goal by Johnny to get us 

going.”

On Monday at Yost Ice Arena, 

Pearson expanded on the work that 

went into Michigan’s power play 

finding twine for the first time in 

three weeks. The Wolverines spent 

more time on the man-advantage 

units in practice than usual and 

made some key position changes 

throughout the week, ultimately 

culminating in a 2-of-6 performance 

on the weekend.

Freshman 
defenseman 
Cam 

York, who had been running the top 

power-play unit from the blueline, 

was moved to run things from the 

left half-wall and Blankenburg took 

York’s spot up top — but not his role.

York’s role as the quarterback 

of the power play remains intact, 

it’s just from a different position on 

the ice. And the change came after 

Pearson took a look at film from 

last year’s team and how he used 

defenseman Quinn Hughes — now a 

rookie with the Vancouver Canucks, 

who leads all NHL rookies and ranks 

fifth overall in points on the power 

play.

“That was just to switch because 

we looked at some tape from last year 

and where Quinn played,” Pearson 

said. “We had Quinn Hughes in 

some different plays — with some 

different plays and in some different 

positions. We decided to try to put 

our people in situations they would 

be comfortable in.”

York had been running things 

from the blueline all year, but he 

never looked fully comfortable in 

the role. And though he missed his 

shift when his typical unit scored 

in Friday’s game, on Michigan’s 

other two opportunities in the 

game, he was visibly more at ease 

working out of the half-wall — and 

the Wolverines’ one power-play goal 

Friday night came after Hayhurst 

made a play from York’s spot on the 

wall.

“He put Yorkie on the left side, so 

(my role is to) get the puck to Yorkie 

and then he’ll have speed going down 

the wall so he can either shoot it (or) 

give it back up to me,” Blankenburg 

said. “…Yorkie’s got a lot of options 

he can do. He can, like I said, go back 

to me, look for Will in the middle, go 

cross-ice to Slakes, go down kinda 

below the net, Beech pops out.

“We had a play where that 

worked, so I think he’s just one of 

those guys where you want the puck 

in his stick.”

While York wasn’t on the ice for 

Michigan’s goal Friday night, the 

principles of his role can easily be 

applied to the play Hayhurst made 

out of the same position.

“Ironically, 
(York) 
was 
tired 

because of a long shift the first night 

so we didn’t have him out there,” 

Pearson said. “We had Hayhurst in 

that position, and Hayhurst actually 

made the play to Will to Beecher, so 

there you go.”

One weekend is almost certainly 

too small of a sample size to 

make sweeping claims about the 

Wolverines’ power play returning to 

functionality, but signs were there 

for both the first and second units 

that there may not be a five-game 

drought again.

In 
Saturday’s 
game, 
junior 

forward Michael Pastujov found 

twine 
with 
Michigan’s 
second 

power-play unit for the first goal of 

the game — and his first tally of the 

season.

And 
Pearson 
feels 
confident 

that the Wolverines are starting to 

figure out the best positions for their 

players on each unit, whether that’s 

York moving down along the wall or 

Pastujov continuing to work from 

the right side, where he had success 

last year.

“You have to be careful and try to 

build your power play around what 

your guys can do well. Maybe in the 

past, we haven’t had guys in the right 

position. I don’t know. (Maybe) we’re 

trying to force some guys into some 

spots. Especially with new guys, you 

have no idea what they’re capable of. 

You think you do, but when you get 

in games, it’s different.”
