Arabic program
will offer three new
courses, 'U' applied
for Chinese flagship
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Students looking to study
beyond Ann Arbor will soon
have more opportunities to do so
through the University.
The Arabic Language Flag-
ship Partner Program, founded at
the University in August 2008 to
help students improve their Ara-
bic writing and speaking skills, is
increasing its course offerings for
the winter semester and applying
to become an independent Arabic
Flagship Center at the University
for the next academic year.
The ALFP is an intensive lan-
guage program offered at multiple
universities, in which undergradu-
ate students work toward attain-
ing superior language proficiency
in Arabic, as rated by the Ameri-

can Council for the Teaching of
Foreign Languages scale. The pro-
gram kicked off in the 2009 winter
semester.
In the program, students must
take at least one modern standard
Arabic course per semester and are
eligible to receive financial support
from the International Institute of
Education, a part ofnthe National
Security Education Program,
which funds the program at the
University.
Since its creation in 2008, Sofia
Rosenberg, coordinator of the
ALFP, said the program has grown
from having nine students to 49
from 16 different majors. She said
enrollment in the program has
been increasing exponentially
every semester.
"It has really expanded and the
interest is just great," Rosenberg
said. "For every application period
we get more and more so that's
wonderful."
As program enrollment increas-
es, Raji Rammuny, director of the
ALFP, said there will also be more
course offerings available. Three

*LSA Theme Semester asks
students to mull life choices

Profs. behind theme
say goal is to promote
thoughtful reflection
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
What makes life worth living?
For millennia, scholars - from
Socrates to Dr. Phil - have been
ondering that very question. And,
as it's the premise for LSA's theme
semester, so will the LSA commu-

nity in the upcoming months.
This semester, hundreds of
classes, lectures, discussions,
films and other events throughout
several departments across the
college will focus on this central
question.
Prof. John Chamberlin, direc-
tor of the Center for Ethics in Pub-
lic Life, and Prof. Chris Peterson,
director of the Michigan Center
for Positive Psychology, came up
with the idea for the semester's
theme and are the co-organizers of
the theme semester.

In separate telephone inter-
views last week, both Chamber-
lin and Peterson said they hope
students take advantage of the
semester's theme because college
is one of the few times when people
have the freedom and resources at
their disposal to think legitimately
about what matters in their lives.
"What we're really hoping for
is, simply, to raise the question,"
Peterson said.
"Ultimately, (everyone) has to
answer that question for them-

Events on Diag,

By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Crossing the North Campus
Diag on their way to class yes-
terday, students were met with

blaring music, bright posters and
pledges for sustainability.
Passersby who stopped to inves-
tigate learned they had come upon
EarthFest - an event held by the
University to advertise a new
movement towards sustainability
and conservation.
The two-day event - a joint
effort between the Graham Insti-
tute for Sustainability, Planet Blue
and a number of other organiza-

tions dedicated to environmen-
tal safety - was held on the Diag
on Tuesday and at The Grove on
North Campus yesterday.
Students who stopped at the
various EarthFest booths were
presented with a flyer containing
a pledge to help the environment
that offered suggestions for dem-

'U' alumopens
William St. location
to help students
deal with pressure
By SARAH ALSADEN
For theDaily
Students meditated, stretched
and breathed deeply in a heated
room as light poured in through
the long, rectangular windows on
the second story of an East Wil-
liam Street building earlier this
week.

These students were partici-
pating in a hot Vinyasa class - a
yoga class taught in hot tempera-
tures - at the Center for Yoga's
fourth and newest location at 621
E. William St., which opened ear-
lier this month.
The Center for Yoga was start-
ed by University alum Jonny Kest
in 1993. Kest, who graduated
from the University in 1985, said
he's wanted to open a yoga studio
close to campus for some time.
"I've always wanted to bring
yoga back to the University of
Michigan," he said.
Kest recalled being a student at
the University and dealing with

high levels of pressure and now
hopes the Center for Yoga can be
a helpful outlet for students to
relieve stress.
"Because when I was there, it
was very stressful being a student
at the University of Michigan,"
Kest said. "There's a lot ofcompe-
tition, a lot of pressure to be suc-
cessful and you need something
healthy to counter that. Rather
than going to the bar or smoking
pot, you need something healthy
to counter the stress."
Kest also said he volunteers
from time to time at Mary Mar-
kley Residence Hall - where he

A detective, left, briefs New York City Council Member Fernando Cabrera, center, and Assemblyman Nelson Castro as they
arrive at the scene where Nicaraguan diplomat, Cesar Mercado, 34, was found dead with his throat slashed in his New York
apartment. He was found by his driver, who was picking him up for the United Nations General Assembly's annual meeting.

Diplomat discovered
with throat slashed,
knife in apartment
NEW YORK (AP) - A Nicara-
guan diplomat was found dead yes-
terday with his throat slashed in
his blood-spattered apartment and
a knife by his side, hours before he
was to attend the United Nations
General Assembly's annual meet-
ing, officials said.
Cesar Mercado, 34, who had
worked at the Nicaraguan consul-
ate as acting consul general, was
found at 10:35 a.m. in his apart-
ment in the Bronx by the driver
who came to pick him up to attend
the meeting, police said.
The driver found the door ajar
and Mercado's body lying just
inside, police said.
"The knife was found on the
floor next to him," said Paul
Browne, the NYPD's deputy com-
missioner for public information.
Police were investigating and no
suspects were immediately iden-
4i

tified. Investigators were looking
into Mercado's recent contacts, his
relationships and where he had
been during the days leading up
to the slaying. A motive remained
unclear.
"He had no enemies. He was
loved by everyone who knew him,"
a friend, Amparo Amador, said in
Spanish. "When I first heard of his
death, I thought he must've died
from natural causes because there
would be no way he could be killed."
Mercado came to the U.S. in
2001 to work as an assistant in the
office of Nicaragua's ambassador
to the United Nations, a friend
said. He was single and his family
was in Nicaragua.
He eventually took on the duties
of consul general, working with
passports and immigration visas.
Amador said he was like a son to
her. Recently, she'd urged him to
go to the doctor because he looked
thin, and he was diagnosed with
diabetes. The two danced at a wed-
ding of another friend in Brooklyn
last week, she said.
"He was the perfect guy. The

best person, just wonderful," she
said. "I feel as if one of my children
has died."
Leaders from 192 nations were
in town for the General Assembly,
including Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, who is a fierce critic
of the United States and a defender
of North Korea and Iran. President
Barack Obama addressed the Gen-
eral Assembly on Thursday.
Nicaraguan Vice President
Jaime Morales said U.S. Ambassa-
dor Robert Callahan assured him
that the FBI would do everything
possible to investigate.
The assistant to the ambassa-
dor said the Nicaraguan mission
in New York couldn't immediately
release any information.
Mercado lived on the top floor
of a six-story apartment building
in a working-class section of the
Bronx. Police barred reporters
from entering the building yes-
terday. Residents said they didn't
hear anything out of the ordinary
Wednesday night, but some said
it's often noisy in the building at
night.

Aretha Franklin
speaks out on her
son's beating
Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin
is speaking out on the beating her
adult son took from three men at a
Detroit gas station.
Franklin said in a statement
yesterday through a public rela-
tions firm that Eddie Franklin
underwent surgery after arriving
at a hospital emergency room early
Tuesday morning. She said his jaw
was wired shut.
Franklin also said her son's girl-
friend gave her the wrong location
of Monday night's attack.
Police said Eddie Franklin, who
is in his 50s, was driven to the hos-
pital by a female acquaintance. He
gave officers a written statement
Wednesday.
The attack originally was report-
ed by Gwendolyn Quinn, who at the
time was Franklin's spokeswoman.
Franklin calls Quinn's GQ Media

Four shot to death
in Seattle home
Police found four people fatally
shot in a Seattle home yesterday
after neighbors reported gunfire
and a wounded woman ran into
the front yard telling officers, "My
mom's gone crazy."
Officers responded to a report
of gunshots at about 1:30 p.m. and
could still hear shots being fired
from the house when they arrived,
police spokesman Sean Whitcomb
said.
Police said that while they were
arriving, a man in his 50s ran into
the house. Two more shots were
fired and he ran back out, telling
officers his wife had shot herself.
When police were able to go
inside, they found the four dead,
including a woman in her 50s they
believe was the shooter, Whitcomb
said.
He said police don't believe any-
one else was involved.
In addition to the older woman,
the dead were two women in their
late teens and a man in his 30s,
police said. Their relationships
were not immediately known.
Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel
told Seattlepi.com a 42-year-old
wounded woman - who fled the
house and is expected to survive -
was able to speak to officers when
they arrived.

gin" of the kidnapping, French
Foreign Minister Bernard Kouch-

Woman fends off

A Montana woman fended off a

her home yesterday by pelting the
animal with a large piece of zuc-
chini from her garden.
The woman suffered minor
scratches and one of her dogs was

200-pound bear.
The attack happened just after
midnight when the woman let her
three dogs into the backyard for
their nighttime ritual before she

Authorities believe the black bear
was just 25 yards away, eating
apples from a tree.
Two of the dogs sensed the bear,
began barking and ran away, Mari-
celli said. The third dog, a 12-year-
old collie that wasn't very mobile,
* remained close to the woman as she
stood in the doorway of the home
near Frenchtown in western Mon-

pipe repaired
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP)
- Oil should resume flowing early
Monday through an underground
pipe that ruptured nearly two
months ago and spilled at least
820,000 gallons of crude oil into a
southern Michigan waterway, the
pipeline owner said yesterday.
Enbridge Inc. CEO Patrick Dan-
iel said the operation will begin in
the morning unless government
regulators object. The company's
restart plan won approval Wednes-
day from the federal Pipeline
and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration.
Enbridge's line 6b - which
runs from Griffith, Ind., to Sarnia,
Ontario - has been out of service
since the leak was detected July
26. When the flow resumes, pres-
sure in the 286-mile-long pipe will
be 20 percent below normal, Dan-
iel said.
"It is very significant to get this
line back into service ... safely," he
said, adding that the company will
notify the public and emergency
response agencies in the area over
the next two days.
U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a
Michigan Democrat, said she was
concerned about going ahead with
the plan before the government
investigation ofthe spillis finished.
"Restarting the pipeline with-
out fully knowing the cause of the
rupture will put families and com-
munities across Michigan at risk,"
Stabenow said.
PHMSA said the restart will be
monitored by an independent third
party. Enbridge alsowill haveto fix
numerous defects in the line and

replace a dented section running
beneath the St. Clair River within
a year.
Daniel said those requirements
will be met, and the new 3,800-
foot segment under the St. Clair
should be installed and operating
by mid-2011.
Enbridge, based in Calgary,
Alberta, also will meet a Monday
deadline set by the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency for
completing the initial cleanup of
the Kalamazoo River and nearby
creeks and shorelines, Daniel
said.
Yesterday, the EPA ordered the
companytofinishremovingoilthat
has been found beneath the water's
surface - and contaminated sedi-
ments - by Oct. 31. Other measures
to restore the area to its pre-spill
condition will continue into next
year, said Mark Durno, the EPA's
deputy incident commander.
Some plants along the Kalama-
zoo River will die this winter, said
Mike Masterson, a section chief
with the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources and Environ-
ment. Experts will decide next
spring where additional vegetation
is needed, he said.
Enbridge also must submit a
report on potential damage to
drinking water supplies and take
samples from wells within 200
feet of affected waterways, said
Susan Hedman, the EPA's regional
administrator.
Some oil in sensitive areas may
be left to deteriorate naturally if
removing it would cause additional
damage, Hedman said.
About 11 million gallons of oily
water have been removed from
the river and creeks, and about
700,000 gallons of oil has been
recovered through a separation
process, Daniel said.

Iranian president
suggested U.S.
staged 9/11 attacks
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.S. delegation walked out of
the U.N. speech of Iranian Presi-
dent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
yesterday after he said some in the
world have speculated that Amer-
icans were behind the Sept.11 ter-
ror attacks, staged in an attemptto
assure Israel's survival.
He did not explain the logic of
that statement that was made as
he attacked the U.S. wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
Ahmadinejad has called for the
destruction of Israel and is deeply
at odds with the United States and
European allies over its nuclear
program and suspicions that it is
designed to produce an atomic
bomb. Iran says it is only working
on technology for electricity gen-
eration.
The U.S. delegation left the
hall after Ahmadinejad said there
were three theories about the
Sept.11, 2001 attacks:
-That "powerful and complex
terrorist group" penetrated U.S.
intelligence and defenses.
-"That some segments within
the U.S. government orchestrated
the attack to reverse the declining
American economy and its grips
on the Middle East in order also
to save the Zionist regime. The
majority of the American people
as well asother nations and politi-
cians agree with this view."
The Americans stood and

walked out without listening to
the third theory, that the attack
was the work of"a terrorist group
but the American government
supported and took advantage of
the situation."
Mark Kornblau, spokesman
of the U.S. Mission to the world
body, issued a statement within
moments of Ahmadinejad's attack.
"Rather than representing the
aspirations and goodwill of the
Iranian people," he said, "Mr.
Ahmadinejad has yet again cho-
sen to spout vile conspiracy theo-
ries and anti-Semitic slurs that
are as abhorrent and delusional as
they are predictable."
Ahmadinejad, who has in the
past cast doubt over the U.S. ver-
sion of the Sept. 11 attacks, called
for establishment of an indepen-
dent fact-finding U.N. body to
probe the attacks and stop it from
turning into another sacred issue
where "expressing opinion about
it won't be banned".
He said the U.S. used the
attacks as a pretext to invade
Afghanistan and Iraq that led to
the killing of hundreds of thou-
sands of people, saying the U.S.
should have "designed a logical
plan" to punish the perpetrators '
while not sheding so much blood.
Ahmadinejad boasted of the
capture in February of Abdulmalik
Rigi, the leader of an armed Sunni
group whose insurgency in the
southeast of Iran has destabilized
the border region with Pakistan.
He said authorities did not resort to
violence, but captured the suspect
after trailing his movements in an
operation by Iranian secret agents.

Rigi was later hanged.
The Iranian leader spoke of
threats to burn the Quran by a
small American church in Florida
to mark the anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terror attacks. Although
that church backed down, several
copycat burnings were posted on
the Internet and broadcast in the
Muslim world.
"Very recently the world wit-
nessed the ugly and inhumane
act of burning the holy Quran,"
Ahmadinejad said.
He briefly touch on the four sets
of sanctions imposed on his coun-
try by the United Nations over
Tehran's refusal stop enriching
uranium and to prove Iran is not
trying to build an atomic bomb.
Some members of the Security
Council have "equated nuclear
energy with nuclear bombs,"
Ahmadinejad said.
He accused the United States
of building up its nuclear arsenal
instead of dismantling it and reit-
erated his call for a nuclear-free
world.
"The nuclear bomb is the
worst inhumane weapon which
must totally be eliminated. The
NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty)
prohibits its development and
stockpiling and calls for nuclear
disarmament," the Iranian presi-
dent said.
Ahmadinejad hinted that Iran
is ready for talks on its nuclear
program provided they are based
on "justice and respect", suggest-
ing that the U.S. and its allies must
stop pressuring Iran through
sanctions before Tehran will sit at
the negotiating table.

Peace Corps events'
timing with theme
semester 'a lucky
accident,' officials say

Chicago awaits Emanuel's
decision on mayoral race

White House chief
of staff is rumored
to be mulling bid
CHICAGO (AP) - The phones
are ringing. Signatures are being
gathered. Groups are vetting who
to support. If White House chief
of staff Rahm Emanuel is going
to launch his expected campaign
for mayor of Chicago, the clock is
ticking on getting started.
Prospective candidates are
lining up support around town,
reaching out to business leaders,
union officials, activists and oth-
ers. Unlike Emanuel, who has
not been seen in Chicago since
Mayor Richard Daley announced
he would not seek re-election and
even canceled a trip to the city,
some already are showing up at
local events and drawing voters
into their corners.
"I met with business leaders, I
met with labor leaders, religious
leaders, an individual who is a
representative of the gay commu-
nity," said James Meeks, a state
senator and one of the Chicago's
leading black clergymen, who is
gathering signatures and widely
expected to run.
And, he said, "It has reached
the point where I've talked to a
group of people who can write
some fairly large checks."
Even if Emanuel decides to
run, it's not clear whether he
would leave President Barack
Obama's administration before
the Nov. 2 midterm elections.
Playing wait and see now could
find him playing catch-up later.
While Emanuel has clearly

been working the phones and
meeting with Chicago politicians
in Washington - and imme-
diately would be considered a
heavyweight if he entered the
race - his absence from the city is
only highlighted by other actions
by Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart
and others.
Dart will enter the race,
according to people close to him,
and this week alone he's doing
something other candidates,
particularly Emanuel, cannot:
Making news for doing his job in
Chicago. He's touted an arrest by
his office of someone suspected of
bilking a mentally disabled man
out of tens of thousands of dollars
and issued a news release about
a new partnership with federal
agents to prevent abuse and theft
of prescription drugs.
Chicago Alderman Bob Fio-
retti, another possible candidate,
attended a recent protest march
by Chicago police who are angry
at their boss, Superintendent
Jody Weis. Fioretti told officers
he supports them and believes, as
they do, Weis should be replaced;
he mentioned that his supporters
were collecting petition signa-
tures too.
Mayoral candidates need
12,500 valid signatures to get
on February's ballot. And Dick
Simpson, a University of Illinois
at Chicago political scientist and
a former alderman, said that
actually means collecting about
30,000 to ensure a spot once any
number of signatures are thrown
out for one reason or another.
That takes people working the
streets. While Meeks and Dart
and others are seen by analysts as

able to reach that number, Simp-
son said he is not sure Emanuel,
with no apparent army of volun-
teers at his disposal, can do the
same.
"My sense is Rahm won't be
able to pull it together," Simp-
son said. But, he said, "If he does
enter the race soon and uses the
money he has he could hire the
people (to collect signatures)."
Some black and Latino candi-
dates mulling a run are preparing
for interviews with a coalition
of black and Latino clergymen,
union leaders, elected officials
and others who are holding what
amounts to their own mini pri-
mary to determine a single candi-
date to support.
City Clerk Miguel del Valle has
announced his run and released
a television ad, while U.S. Rep.
Luis Gutierrez has been gather-
ing signatures for support in Chi-
cago's heavily-Mexican enclaves.
Former U.S. Sen. Carol Mose-
ley Braun, who announced this
week she was considering a run,
is making her own rounds of the
city.
But to some, including U.S.
Rep. Danny Davis, the interviews
are the whole ball game.
"If I'm chosen then I'm a can-
didate," he said. "If (they) choose
someone else, I will support who-
ever they choose."
Meeks said he doesn't know
whether he also would drop out
without that group's support,
but he may be a front-runner to
win it after finishing first last
week among 16 candidates in a
straw poll of 100 ministers, most
from black churches on the city's
South and West sides.

From Page 1A
selves," he continued. "There's
probablya huge variety of answers,
but you're not going to have an
answer unless you engage the
question. Our goal ... is to raise
the question, to legitimize discus-
sion of it, because if you can't do it
on a university campus, where are
you going to raise that question?
Where are you going to discuss it
l an open way?"
The co-organizers added that at
the University today, students are
often more worried about prepar-
ing for future careers than they are
about learning for learning's sake.
Chamberlin and Peterson both
said they hope the theme semester
will help change this mindset.
"In these economic times, stu-
dents are especially concerned
about, 'How am I going to prepare
for a career?' and sometimes that
takes them towards pre-profes-
sional thinking and, perhaps, away
from a general question of what
makes life worth living," Peterson
said. "I think in the modern uni-
versity, disciplinary specialization
increasingly leaves attention to
these questions to others."
Peterson used a metaphor to
describe the focus on pre-profes-
sional tracks.
"It's easy to miss the forest for
the trees," he said. "The forest is
what makes life worth living. Why
are we trying to get good grades?
Why are we trying to get jobs?
We just want to have a discussion
going, and I think it's starting."
Most of the theme semester

events, Peterson said, are being
organized by other departments
and are just being co-sponsored by
the theme semester. This means
there will be a wide array of events
to appeal to individuals with vary-
ing interests.
Some of the theme's signature
events will revolve around the Uni-
versity's celebration of the Peace
Corps's 50th anniversary, from
Oct. 13-1S.
When then-Senator John F.
Kennedy was runningfor president
in 1960, he made an impromptu
late-night speech to a crowd gath-
ered on the steps of the Michigan
Union. In that speech, Kennedy
first announced his intentions to
create an organization for interna-
tional service - later to be named
the Peace Corps.
Chamberlin said it was a tre-
mendous coincidence that this
particular theme semester so
appropriately coincides with the
Peace Corps celebration.
"That was a lucky accident for
us," he said. "Sometime after we
said, 'Let's do this!' we realized the
Peace Corps celebration was going
to happen. It's the perfect event to
have duringthe theme semester."
Chamberlin continued, "Michi-
gan has sent several thousand peo-
ple into the Peace Corps. It's been
an important way in which liberal
arts graduates, in many cases, go
out and find themselves in the
world."

ter events can be found at the

State tax incentives for film should be continued
M ichigan has seen more than its fair share of movie
stars recently. The state's tax rebates for the film
industry have brought television and movie produc-
ers to Michigan. But a recent report from the state Senate Fiscal
Agency questions the benefits of the program. The report claims
that the industry doesn't provide the financial stability needed to
revitalize Michigan's economy. It also suggests that the majority
of the money spent by the film industry doesn't stay in Michigan.
Though the film industry isn't a sustainable source of revenue,
the tax incentive should be continued to give Michigan's econo-
my whatever help it can get in a time of need.

Shoelace is a student

Michigan's film industry tax rebate is
the highest in America at 42 percent. If the
project doesn't use Michigan resources
and workers, the rebate drops to 30 per-
cent. Since 2009, the incentive has brought
several producers to the state. The movie
"Gran Torino" and the new show "Detroit
1-8-7" are only a few of the recent proj-
ects filmed in Michigan. But the Michigan
legislature isn't convinced that the pro-
gram is helping bridge the deficit, citing
the nomadic nature of the film industry.
With the gubernatorial election approach-
ing, candidates and voters are scrutiniz-
ing the tax rebate. Rick Snyder sides with
the legislature with his plan to phase out
the incentive while Virg Bernero plans to
keep them as long as they continue to cre-
ate jobs.
The tax rebate has attracted a new and
lucrative industry to our state in its time
of economic struggle. The film industry's
presence creates new jobs and helps coun-
ter the state's dismal unemployment rate.
While the actors, directors and producers
are filming they need food and a place to
stay. Michigan's restaurants, hotels and
local businesses profit from the thousands
of people who work on production sets.
This ripple effect helps the economy at
all levels, increasing the overall positive
effect of the incentives.

The industry also provides a necessary
transformation from dependence on the
automotive industry. Abandoned warehous-
es and plants are put to use as film studios.
Workers laid off from the auto industry are
retrained in film positions. The industry is
helping Michigan achieve an important eco-
nomic goal - diversification.
But the SFA's report was correct in say-
ing that the industry isn't going to stay in
Michigan permanently. Once production
is wrapped, the jobs it created will once
again leave and there needs to be some-
thing to fill the void. It's important that
the legislature realizes this and doesn't
expect profits from the film industry to
single-handedly solve Michigan's econom-
ic issues. The film industry may not besus-
tainable, but it will help maintain the state
while our economy changes and recovers.
The state should continue the incentive to
entice the film industry to work in Michi-
gan as a stop-gap measure. But Michigan
must continue to pursue other plans to
improve and diversify the economy.
Profits .from the film industry aren't
going to fix Michigan's economy in the
long run, but for now they are a nice source
of revenue and support for local business-
es. The state legislature needs to maintain
the existence of tax incentives while still
exploring other avenues for job creation.

With every football Satur-
day that has gone by since
the start of this season, I
have seen at least
two new t-shirts
dedicated to fellow
student-athlete,
Denard Robinson.
These creative -
t-shirts have sport- y
ed phrases such as
"Nard Dog," "Shoe-
lace," "Let's Get -
Denarded" and are COURTNEY
worn by students
all over campus. FLETCHER
While these t-shirts
are great in the
fact that they recognize outstanding
performance and reflect positively on
Robinson, they pose a problem to the
Athletic Department and the NCAA.
The Athletic Department recently
issued cease and desist letters to local
businesses, which ordered a discon-
tinuation of the production and sale
of individualized t-shirts glorifying
current Michigan student-athletes
due to NCAA rules, according to a
Sept. 21 article in the Daily. The rule
states that no NCAA student-athlete
or business can make money off of
current players. The reasoning is that
getting money in exchange for play is
meant for professionals.
This doesn't just mean getting paid
to play. Athletes also have to be care-
ful about autographed apparel, public
appearances, personal promotion and
private lessons. Student-athletes have
to be very careful to not violate these
rules or their loss of amateur status
and eligibility to play in college could
be compromised. And when busi-
nesses capitalize on the fame, they are
also breaking this rule. Even though
student-athletes are not involved in
making these t-shirts, it's considered

self-promotion and could endanger an
athlete's amateur status.
If I were giventhe option of watch-
ing a professional team or watching
a college team, I would choose col-
lege almost every time. That goes
for football, basketball, tennis, base-
ball, hockey - everything. There is
something special about being and
watching an amateur athlete. When
you watch a college team, you know
their motives. Student-athletes are
playing the game because they love it
and it's a part of their education. It's
about the team, the University and
the game, not the self-gratification. A
vast majority of college athletes will
not play professionally, so they real-
ize that this is their time to shine,
that they should leave it all on the
court and to give it everything they
have. There's no reason to hold back
because it will be over in four short
years. I'm not saying that profession-
al athletes don't love what they do or
that they don't have immense passion
for the games they play, but after the
wins and losses there's still a pay-
check. And that changes the waythey
play and the atmosphere of the team.
There is also more community sup-
port coming from everyone includ-
ing everyone from students, alumni,
teachers, faculty and fans for col-
lege teams. For example, if you're a
Lions fan, and you happen to be in
New Orleans when the Saints win a
Super Bowl, you will most likely go
out and celebrate the Saints's win.
But let's say you're a Michigan fan
and Florida wins a national cham-
pionship. I highly doubt you will be
doing the Gator chomp or wearing
that hideous shade of orange (though
I do know there are crazy pro sports
fans that will disagree). But that's
because there is more behind college
programs. There are some 15 other

sports, tradition, an entire university
and more people invested ina college
than a professional sports team.
There is also something to be said
for the loyalty in college sports. By
the time a professional athlete is done
playing, they could have a laundry list
of teams they've played for, but their
college will still be listed as one.
Keep the
celebrity out of
college athletics.
.0
Which brings me back to the
t-shirts. There are always going to be
outstandingplayers thatget more glory
and press than others. And with all the
hard work they put in, this credit is
absolutely deserved. But let's not let
this recognition take college athletics
into a professional arena. Profession-
als have toworry aboutpaparazzi, tab-
loids, public image and trust, but let's
leave that for them. Letcollege athletes
be college athletes and learn to grow
up and succeed along with everyone
else. Keep the celebrity of professional
athletics in professional athletics.
Personalized t-shirts, autograph
signings, money and celebrity are all
.perks of making it to the next level.
Though it is no doubt a smart busi-
ness move to make money off of out-
standing performance, it's taking
away from the atmosphere of college
sports. Let the wins and outstand-
ing performances be about Michigan
football - not individuals.

41,000+ helping hands

Ann Arbor comes with a certain organic,
community-oriented reputation. But as I
walked up State Street, the sign posted outside
the space previously occupied by independent
bookseller Shaman Drum screamed quite the
opposite. This October, a Five Guys Burgers
and Fries chain will open up where the book-
store resided for 29 years and will contribute
the demise of local business in Ann Arbor.
Is it completely idealistic to hope that Ann
Arbor will stay unique? Is it a lost cause to
believe that citizens and students alike can
resist a corporate takeover? The loss of Sha-
man Drum is just one example of the declin-
ing city support for locally owned businesses.
In the area visible from where Five Guys will
open, I can see a Starbucks, Chipotle, Buffalo
Wild Wings and Urban Outfitters. The trend is
most definitely not Ann Arbor's friend.
Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. Ann Arbor has
managed to maintain some of its ingrained local
culture. Between a string of independent record
stores, coffee shops and the famous Fleetwood
Diner, Ann Arbor is far from generic. Unfortu-
nately, however, in the areas most accessible to
students, evidence that Ann Arbor was once a
locally supported city is becoming sparse.
In my opinion, Michigan students have
played a prominent role in the downfall of
local business. We seem to struggle with the
notion that we have a certain responsibility
to the community of Ann Arbor. Far too many
students treat Ann Arbor as if they are simply
passing through while they are enrolled at the
University. Given the massive presence the
University has in Ann Arbor, it's possible that
students lose sight of the reality that this is also
the permanent home of over 100,000 residents,

many of whom rely on the local economy to
make a living. But ignorance is by no means an
excuse for the lack of consideration the student
body has for the city of Ann Arbor.
As far as I can see, the student body as a
whole makes very little effort to foster the
growth of local business in Ann Arbor. But the
encouraging news is that it will take very little
initiative for the student body to actually make
a difference. Instead of settling for the conve-
nience of Jimmy Johns, Dominos and a variety
of other large, recognizable chains, students
should frequent Maize and Blue, Pizza Bob's
and a variety of other locally run establish-
ments. Instead of buying their books from the
massive Barnes and Noble, students should
purchase their books and supplies from Ann
Arbor's own Ulrich's. The list of simple ways
in which students can support local businesses
can go on and on. As a university of more than
40,000, the slightest effort on behalf of the stu-
dent body can undoubtedly make a difference
in the composition of Ann Arbor's economy.
Borders, the international bookstore chain,
was founded in our city of Ann Arbor, right
around the corner from where Five Guys will
open. The support of local business is not some
idealistic pet project. Rather, local business
in Ann Arbor has the capacity to flourish to
heights far beyond the city limits. I urge the
student body to step up, harbor the spirit of
our city and sustain the tradition of local busi-
ness in Ann Arbor. It would truly be a shame
for future generations of Wolverines to have
no proof of the unique culture of local business
that is integral to the history of Ann Arbor.

To the man that assaulted
me last week at the Hatcher
Graduate Library: Thank
you. Now, don't get
me wrong - I'm
still slightly irked
that you threw me
down a flight of
stairs. The bruises
and bumps still
hurt, and trying
to get through the
Diag on a Tues-
day afternoon on MELANIE
crutches is about KRUVELIS
as easy as organic
chemistry. But
despite the inju-
ries, I must thank you, because if
it hadn't been for that fateful push
down the staircase, I might have
never felt like I belonged here. You've
given me something more permanent
than a couple of scars - a glimpse at
what it means to be part of the Michi-
gan community.
Before I get caught up in too many
"we bleed blue" metaphors, allow me
to backtrack to Welcome Week 2010.
For us freshman, it's the first bite of
college, seasoned with innumerable
handshakes, countless names lost in
an instant and a plethora of inebriated
moments forever remembered through
tagged photos on Facebook.
As I wandered through the alphabet
soup of frat houses, I was left with a
bitter aftertaste - and it wasn't just the
jungle juice at work. After four years of
kind of working hard in high school, I
had arrived. These were my "Animal
House"years - Icould be Otter, I could
be Bluto (every teenage girl's dream).
But somewhere between being
crushed in a mob of intoxicated
men and stepping in vomit, I began

to question whether or not I could
ever fit into the party scene. Though
my thick-rimmed glasses and dowdy
sweaters might suggest otherwise,
perhaps I wasn't meant to spend the
next four years as an anonymous face
with a red plastic cup in tow. Sudden-
ly I found myself preparing a funeral
for my social life, pondering how
many UMixes I could attend before I
would spontaneously combust at the
sight of pizza and hemp bracelets.
In no time, classes started up, forc-
ing me to leave my social insecurities
on the backburner. And unlike my
foray into Greek life, I was prepared
this time. I was convinced that I could
make a voice for myself and emerge as
a leader of provocative discussions. It
wasn't until I attended my first lecture
that I found a significant roadblock
in my plan to become the professor's
pet: The kids here are kind of smart.
And unless you shell out cash for an
i>clicker, it can be next to impossible
togetyourvoiceheard in those imper-
sonal auditoriums. I didn't know
anyone's name and they didn't know
mine. I felt about as much at home as I
do in the gym.
But as fate would have it, my appre-
hensions, my concerns and, yes, my
whiny attitude were put to rest last
Monday evening. After about an hour
on Stumble Upon and a good 20 min-
utes on a philosophy paper, I headed
out of the third floor cubicles. Then I
noticed Lenny Kravitz's doppleganger
approaching the stairs. I turned to hold
the door open for him, when suddenly
I felt him grab the back of my shirt and
hurl me down a flight of stairs. Luckily,
my screams resonated throughout the
second floor and my knight in shining
armor - a studious lookingyoung man
with a calculus book in hand - entered

the stairwell. The attacker grabbed my
cell phone and ran off.
When I hobbled onto the second
floor, the entire computer lab rushed
to me, offering water or a phone
- anything to help. I was shaken,
no doubt, and in quite a bit of pain,
but never once did I feel as if I were
alone. The librarians, the police offi-
cers, the students themselves - they *
all rushed to my side. I couldn't recall
a time where I felt more at home with
a group of complete strangers.
Despite large
numbers, the 'U' is
still a community.
The support didn't end at the steps
of Hatcher. Upon returning to the
dorms, I was greeted with endless
support. Strangers asked to carry my
books, provided an open ear, offered
anythingin hopes to make me feellike
I was home. And maybe it was slight-
ly unorthodox to feel such a sense of *
belonging after being assaulted, but
then again, so was being attacked in
a library.
So thank you, Mr. 61", 160-lb,
dark-skinned male. Thank you for
showing me that despite the large
numbers, the University is indeed a
close-knit community. Thank you for *
making me feel likeI belong. Oh, and
if it's not too much trouble, could I get
my iPhone back?

'M' opens Big Ten play
after starting year 11-1

Senior Lexi Zimmerman is 25 assists away from the breaking the Michigan all-time assists record, previously held by Linnea
Mendoza. Michigan coach Mark Rosen said Zimmerman may be the best player to ever suit up for the Wolverines.
Zimmerman ready
to mak real histoy

Want to see some real
history this weekend?
You know, the kind of
achievement that may never be
surpassed? Something like Wayne
Gretzky's single-season record of
92 goals or Cal Ripken Jr.'s "Iron
Man" streak of 2,632 consecu-
tive games played in the major
leagues?
Michigan
volleyball
senior setter
Lexi Zimmer-
man is on pace
to accomplishl
something
pretty special
on Friday. With MARK
just 25 assists BURNS
separating her
from Linnea
Mendoza - the Wolverines' all-
time assists leader - the spotlight
will shine ever so brightly on the
Barrington, Illinois native inside
Cljffea~enAryea tonight. , -
The only question is when last
year's Michigan Female Athlete
of the Year will finally eclipse
the historic mark. Early in the
second set? Toward the end of
the frame? Possibly as late as the
third? This I'll guarantee: barring

any unforeseen circumstances,
Zimmerman will make some real
history against Iowa.
All of Zimmerman's hard
work - extra workout sessions
and dedication in the gym - will
culminate ina record-breaking
performance, even if it isn't a
surprise, and one that you need to
truly witness.
Arguably the best volleyball
player to have worn the maize
and blue in program history, Zim-
merman has been at the heart of
all the Wolverines' success in the
past three seasons, the program's
most successful stretch run.
Just look at the wall next to
the electronic scoreboard at Cliff
Keen and you'll see what I'm talk-
ing about.
Since her freshman year, Zim-
merman has started in every set
of every Wolverine match, a total
of 119 consecutive matches. She's
overcome an injury to her right
thiAb last October,, ot missing
a beat as she led Michigan to an
Elite Eight appearance, its best
finishever. t!I k"
Oh, by the way, she also led the
nation in assists in 2009.
Not to mention that Zimmer-
man isn't going to barely squeak

by or just topple the all-time
mark. She is going to crush the
record.
If Zimmerman continues at
this pace, by season's end she will
have roughly 1,000 more assists
than the closest setter. That
seems pretty unreachable - for a
while at least.
With a host of other Michigan
records to her name - first fresh-
man setter to start an NCAA
Tournament match, most assists
in a single season and first Wol-
verine to be named to the AVCA
All-American first team - this
one is the record.
Even if you don't care at all
for volleyball or aren't too crazy
about sports in general, head to
State and Hoover tonight. Grab
a few friends. Throw on some
maize garb. Witness some real
history.
Oh, and remember how I was
telling you Zimmerman will
probably crush Michigan's all-
time assist record by 1,000. Well,
she's at 5,048 now.
The Big Ten record is 6,087.
Think about it.

first 12 games as the "preseason."
Though its 11-1 non-conference
record has just as legitimate an
influence on Michigan's postseason
as Big Ten games do, the Wolver-
ines have treated their first dozen
games more like a warm-up than
anything else.
Michigan used this preseason
to get its younger players adjusted
to Division I volleyball, to give
the older players more experience
working with the younger players
and to give the coaches different
ideas about how to rely less on the
veterans.
Michigan started strong in the
Rocket Classic by defeating Bing-
hamton and Loyala 3-0. But in the
tournament's final match, Toledo
upset the Wolverines, 3-2. After the
game, Michigan coach Mark Rosen
sat against the wall on the floor
outside of the locker room. Nearly
speechless, it was clear that Rosen
did not intend for this to happen
again. Maybe his team wasn't as
good this season.
"In hindsight, the slip-up against
Toledo was a good thing," Rosen
said this week. "We saw who we
were, and we saw how we were.
If we didn't open our eyes to that
we would not know where we are
now."
Michigan then played in the
Active Ankle Challenge in Corval-
lis, Oregon one weekend and in the
Michigan/Adidas tournament in
Ann Arbor the next. The Wolver-
ines walked away with a first-place
finish in both. They defeated five
of their six opponents 3-0. Oregon
State provided the only challenge,
but Michigan still had no trouble
beating the Beavers 3-1.
The Wolverines used those six
games to improve communication
between a host of new and experi-
enced players. It took some getting
used to, but by the end of the six-
game stretch, Michigan had played
every person on its active roster.
"I think the freshmen are ready,"
senior defensive specialist Maggie
Busch said. "They have gotten com-
fortable with us. The game now is
different then club and high school.
Keeping with the pace ... they have

JED MOCH/Daily

adjusted. And they have gotten
used to the emotional side of it."
Junior outside hitter Alex Hunt
had the most kills in three of those
games. Likewise, right side Claire
McElheny and middle blockers
Courtney Fletcher and Jennifer
Cross each led the team in kills for
one of those games, helping Hunt
shoulder the load.
"All five of our freshmen have at
one point or another impacted us
and not all at the same time, and
thank God," Rosen said jokingly
after practice on Tuesday. "But I
don't think we ever had a freshman
class where all had impacted us.
We're going to be young for a long
time, but we are getting less young."
Michigan learned three things
in its preseason tournaments. First,
the team no longer has to revolve
around Hunt's hot hand, which was
the expectation with such a young
roster.
"There is no question that we
will have to be balanced to be suc-
cessful," Busch said. "Alex is our
big gun, and we will use her. But we
trust our young girls. We do have
the ability to be a well balanced
team."
Secondly, the freshmen have
proven reliable. Cross and fellow
freshman Lexi Erwin played valu-
able minutes and accounted for 137

kills in the "preseason." That's 23
percent, overall.
Lastly, the freshmen got a chance
to play with senior setter Lexi Zim-
merman. The Wolverines run a
nuanced offense, with only one set-
ters. The entire team must know
how that one setter plays. The expe-
rience the freshmen gained playing
with Zimmerman will be needed
when they are playing a fast-paced
conference team.
The Wolverines traveled to Ari-
zona for the ASU Sheraton tour-
nament last weekend. Michigan
defeated three of its toughest oppo-
nents each in 3-1 matches to finish
in the most ideal way heading into
conference play.
Big Ten play starts tonight
against Iowa, as the Wolverines sit
at fourth in the conference stand-
ings and the Hawkeyes rank last.
But as the Wolverines know too
well - you can never be too sure
aboutyour opponent.
"I told the girls today we want to
have signature wins and afterward
say, 'That's a good win right there,"'
Rosen said on Tuesday. "We haven't
had signature wins yet because we
haven't played signature teams.
We've only played the preseason.
But now that we have the opportu-
nity, (we'll) have the chance to see
what's ahead of us."

After an injury-plagued career,
* Nissen remains part of team


By EMILY FONTENOT
For the Daily
Adorning the locker room wall
of the Michigan volleyball team is
a simple, yet meaningful phrase.
'Committed to the unknown'. Jack-
ie Nissen, as she entered the locker
room as a young freshman, had
dreams of becoming an All-Atheri-
can, leaving her mark at Cliff Keen
Arena.
Michigan athletes who walk
through the locker room are all
ultimately "committed to the
unknown." As the players know
hauntingly too well, in sports there
are no guarantees.
They understand some goals are
dreams that may be attainable at
one point in time, and due to cir-
cumstances unachievable in the
next. The Wolverines witnessed
this in Jackie Nissen, whose injuries
throughout her career have made
her dreams of being an All-Ameri-
can unachievable.
The injuries started in Nissen's
junior year of high school in 2006,
when she had a surgery to shorten a
tendon in her shoulder. The simple
surgery allowed her to continue to
play. But she then needed yet anoth-
er on her shoulder to fix her torn
labrum.
"I remember vaguely the doctor
saying that there was a small chance
of (it) getting irritated (because)
right where they had to fix it, it was
where my bicep was." Nissen recalls
of her meeting with the doctor prior
to her second surgery. "But it was a
really small chance."
She optimistically rehabbed,
believing that this small chance of
irritation that the doctor warned
her of would not happen to her. But
it did. She had pain flowing through
her arm, specifically where her
bicep attached, just as the doctor
said might occur. Pain became the
theme of her life as a student-ath-
lete.
Once again, the only relief she
would have from the pain would
be another surgery. Reluctant to
endure the rehab and recovery of
another surgery, Nissen opted for a
cortisone shot to help the pain.

"It wasgreat while it lasted." Nis-
sen says, her voice trailing off.
Although the cortisone shot
allowed her to participate in prac-
tice, she left practice with a limb
that felt as if it weighed 100 pounds,
causing her pain to intensify. Final-
ly, she succumbed to the idea of a
third surgery, which she underwent
in 2008.
In the meantime, a stress frac-
ture was added to her injuries, leav-
ing Nissen with a swollen foot. And
after months of medicating her-
self through practices and restless
nights filled with pain, Nissen sat
down with her doctor and Michigan
coach Mark Rosen. The three came
to the decision for her to finally call
it quits.
Surprisingly, Nissen described
her decision to be done with playing
college volleyball as a relief.
"If you had talked to me two
months before it, I would've said,
'Absolutely not, I want to give
this everything,' " she recalls.
"But when he came to me it was
a relief"
Although playing volleyball is
no longer a part of her life, Nis-
sen hasn't given up her place on
the team. Taking her injuries in
stride, she worked on a plan with
Rosen to be the team's student
assistant.
"Coach told me I could define
whatever type of position I want-
ed, and I told him I just wanted
to be treated like I'm an injured
player," Nissen said. "I want to
travel if it's possible."
While the job at first didn't
entail traveling, after her team-
mates insisted, Rosen agreed to
let her partake in all the activi-
ties an injured player would.
Whether it was pointing out
things to aid in the develop-
ment of the middle blockers or
shagging balls to help practice
run smoother, her day-to-day
role is obvious to those on the
team.
Despite her injury-plagued
career, through good and bad,
Nissen has an aura of grace
which has been admirable to
newcomers on the team. In fact,

senior defensive specialist and
housemate of Nissen, Maggie
Busch, sees her as someone who
the freshmen can easily look up
to.
"They feel comfortable around
her," Busch said. "She leads by
example ... (which) I feel is truly
rare in this world."
Nissen is also the first vol-
leyball player to go through the
nursing school under Rosen, a
feat requiring impeccable time
management as well as intense
dedication.
Nissen has taken on her chal-
lenges and obstacles with vigor.
"Because I committed to
coming here, I committed to
playing volleyball here and if
I can't do that I want to make
sure I finish out strong," Nissen
said.

FLAGSHIP
From Page 1A
new online courses for students
who have reached an advanced
language level will be offered in
the winter semester.
As part of the program's initial
three-year grant, from 2008-2011,
the University's program operates
in partnership with the University
of Texas at Austin and Michigan
State University.
However, Rammuny wrote in
an e-mail interview that the pro-
gram will apply to become an
independent center for the next
academic year.
Rammuny added that though
the application process is "com-
petitive," he feels the large enroll-
ment numbers in the program, as
well as its development of creative

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

research studies and language
courses, will work in the pro-
gram's favor.
Rosenberg echoed Rammuny's
optimism, saying she is confident
the program will become an inde-
pendent center.
As the flagship program pro-
gresses, students are also strongly
encouraged to spend a year or
summer studying abroad at the
flagship sites of Alexandria Uni-
versity in Egypt and the University
of Damascus in Syria, Rosenberg
said. Students with a high level of
proficiency are able to attend the
yearlong curriculum, while those
with lower proficiency levels can
take part in the summer program.
Rosenberg said this is the first
year that University students in
the program traveled abroad for
the summer program. Two stu-
dents participated in the yearlong

program after completing courses
in the program's first year.
Students can also take part in
an extracurricular Arabic cultural
club, in which they can practice
speaking or receive tutoring.
When students graduate from
the program, they receive a certifi-
cate stating that they have reached
an L3, or professional proficiency
level. Rosenberg said this desig-
nation is an important resource
when looking for a job, as a vari-
ety of employers want employees
who can speak critical world lan-
guages.
Rosenberg added that because
the flagship program is govern-
ment-funded, many students are
able to find jobs in the public sec-
tor.
LSA senior Valerie Montes, who
is in her third year of the program,
said she feels her experience in

the program will make her a more
employable job applicant.
"I think it will be pretty easy to
find opportunities," Montes said.
"I just have to decide what direc-
tion I want to go in."
Montes, who studied abroad ina
yearlong program, added that her
experience overseas was invalu-
able to helping her achieve fluency
in Arabic.
The University has also applied
to the International Institute of
Education to establish a Chinese
Flagship Center, which will be
housed in the Department of Asian
Languages and Cultures. The
status of the application will be
determined in December, however
department and University offi-
cials declined multiple requests
for comment on the center, veri-
fying only that an application has
been submitted.


EARTHFEST
From Page 1A
tips include using refillable water
bottles, closing windows when air
conditioning is on, using energy
saving computer settings and pur-
chasing "green" products.
The event was designed to
publicize the University's new
approach toward conservation,
dubbed "integrated assessment"
by its organizers. Since the offi-
cial creation of the University's
Office of Sustainability by Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
in October of last year, the new
initiative has aimed to employ
all available campus resources to
achieve the goal of a greener cam-
pus.
Andrew Berki, manager of the
University's Office of Sustain-
ability, said EarthFest improved
upon an event called Energy Fest,
which the University held for the
last ten years.
"Energy Fest was focused
mainly on energy reduction and
the operational programs that we
have on campus," he said. "This
year we wanted to make it a broad
sustainability event instead of just
about energy reduction, and we
wanted to include other groups as
well as operational units."
The University drew from
every possible resource to achieve
a broader approach for the event,
Berki said.
"It complements a holistic
view of campus," he said. "Not
just operations, but teamwork
between operational efforts, aca-
demic efforts, research efforts and
student involvement and activity."
As a result, 32 organizations,

release about the study distribut-
ed last week states.
Scott Hirth, manager of The M
Den, said the retailer uses their
Twitter account, @TheMDen, to
announce new products and infor-
mation about in-store events to
their 1,655 followers.
"We've been around for a lot of
years, using a variety of different
advertising mediums, but using
Twitter to let a lot of people know
about something instantaneously
has been successful," Hirth said.
Jim Millan, owner of Bella
Italia Pizza and Pasta of Ann
Arbor, located at 895 West Eisen-
hower Pkwy., said he uses the
restaurant's Twitter account, @
BellaItaliaA2, to hold contests and
announce the restaurant's deals of
the day.
"Last summer we did a contest
where almost every day we would
give away a free pizza to people
who 'followed' us on Twitter,"
Millan said. "The first five people
who came in and mentioned the
tweet got a free slice or free pizza.
We got a good following out of it."
Along with the benefit of inter-
acting with the restaurant's 705

lived as a freshman - giving free
lessons to students. Because stu-
dents are often on a tight budget,
Kest said his yoga studio offers stu-
dent discounts.
The Center for Yoga, which has
three other locations around south-
east Michigan, offers Hatha-based
yoga, a style of yoga that dates back
to 15th Century India. The East
William location currently offers
two types of classes - hot Vinyasa
and Vinyasa flow.
Juliana Khalifeh, an instructor
at multiple locations of the Center
for Yoga who was previously a stu-
dent at the yoga studio, said she's
glad tobe teaching at the new loca-
tion, because she says teaching stu-
dents is a unique experience.
"I love it. There's nothing quite
like it," Khalifeh said. "Teaching
up here is really great because you
get to teach to students that are
a little bit younger and a little bit
more open and looking for spiri-
tuality, and I think it's something
important in these years of a young
person's life to have this kind of
spiritual grounding and element."

Twitter followers ina more engag-
ing way, Millan said he likes that
Twitter is fast and free to use.
"Instead of spending money on
advertising, I am spending money
on the customers for the promo-
tion," Millan said.
Another local business, the
Produce Station, uses their @
producestation Twitter account
to inform customers when they
get unique and fresh ingredients
in the store, located at 1629 State
Street.
According to Andrew Gorsuch,
the gourmet market's general
manager, tweeting about seasonal
produce to their 549 followers has
proven to be "an effective way to
communicate quickly with cus-
tomers about cool products with-
out having to spend a lot of time."
Being able to connect with their
followers and posting pictures
of new produce on Twitter has
"attracted customers for sure,"
Gorsuch said.
Chris Hanrath, a University
alum who graduated in 2009, said
he often uses Twitter to learn
about discounts and promotions.
"I go to places for dinner
because they tweet something like
50-percent off your meal," Han-
rath said. "I look at Twitter and
use pretty much any discount if it's
worth going to the business."
LSA senior Ashley Musiker
started taking classes at the Center
for Yoga's West Stadium Boulevard
location in August, but has since
switched to the East William loca-
tion. She said that so far, her experi-
ence has been very gratifying.
"It's been really great physically
and mentally," Musiker said. "I feel
stronger and more in shape and it
helps with mental clarity and deal-
ing with stress."
Business School senior Sandra
Fadel, who just finished her first
class at the Center for Yoga, said
she's taken yoga classes at the Cen-
tral Campus Recreation Building
before, but much prefers the atmo-
sphere of the new studio.
"(There were) less people, a dif-
ferent environment, not as crowd-
ed, I would say," Fadel said. "Plus I
have to say the instructor is young-
er so you relate to her more."
LSA senior Pranadhi Koradia
asked another student who came
out of the studio about her experi-
ence, as Koradia said she's inter-
ested in taking a class sometime in
the future.
"This is a really good location,"
Koradia said. "I haven't attended a
class yet but I hear it's really good.
It's a good break from routine."

Architecture senior Michael Herrick signs a pledge to protect the environment at Earthfest on the North Campus Diag yesterday.

including the Michigan Animal
Rights Society, the Michigan Sus-
tainable Foods Initiative, U-M
Green It and Strategies for Ecol-
ogy Education and Development,
participated in the event.
Sarah Romanski, senior admin-
istrative assistant at the Graham
Institute, said EarthFest also pre-
sented an important opportunity
for environmental action groups
to recruit members and to get peo-
ple involved.
"Undergraduate applications
for the Graham Institute are com-
ing out in a couple of months,"
Romanski said. "And we have a
town hall meeting coming up that
we are trying to advertise."
O4both Tuesday and Thursday,
a massive pile of trash sat on the
pavement of the venues as volun-

teers sorted the recyclable materi-
als from landfill trash.
LSA sophomore Cydney Sieg-
erman worked at the trash sort
and recycling booth. She said her
activity showed students that dis-
posing of trash properly is an easy
way to play a part in the greater
movement toward environmental
action.
"We should make sure as indi-
viduals and as a group to be envi-
ronmentally safe and to make the
University a more environmental-
ly-friendly campus," Siegerman
said.
Berki said the trash-sorting
booth, which sorted through
one day's worth of garbage from
Mason and Angell Halls, helped
show students the impact of their
actions. 17 trash bags out of the

42 total bags - about 40 percent
- that were collected contained
recyclable content, he said.
"We viewed that as a teachable
moment for the campus commu-
nity," Berki said.
In the wake of EarthFest's
success, Berki said students and
other members of the Ann Arbor
community should look out for
more environmentally-friendly
messages and changes around
campus as a result of the Inte-
grated Assessment sustainability
movement.
"We want to continue work-
ing with students and groups on
campus to spread the word about
being a green Wolverine," Berki
said. "It's a growing program at U
of M, and it's something everyone
ought to be proud of."

this has never been done before
on a law show - posing someone
that crazy as a successful individ-

"Californication"), the young and
pissy male law clerk (Jesse Brad-
ford, "Bring it On") and the sex-

"Orange County"). About the only
other thing missing from this uber-
stereotypical law show is the nerdy

of the show's orginality, he will
probably make an appearance very
soon.
With "Outlaw," NBC has wasted
its time trying to make a unique
law show and has crossed the line
separating inventive and over the
top. The network should have dedi-
cated time to writing more episodes
for the recently canceled "Law
& Order" rather than pursuing a
shoddier series in the same genre.

escape the box of
traditional the-
ater form.
Leddy, who acts as a specialist
advisor for the Scottish Arts Coun-
cil and sits on the council for the
Scottish Society of Playwrights,
created "Susurrus," which means
"rustling in trees," so he could
present a work that used a close,
intimate voice like someone whis-
pering in your ear.
"You can do that live if you want-
ed to, but it would be quite a dis-
turbing thing for most audiences to
have a stranger come and whisper
in their ear over their shoulder,"
said Leddy, who has a background
in performance art, in an interview
with the Daily.
He wrote the script in 2006 and
recorded the four characters to be
played through earphones. "Susur-
rus" is the second addition to
"Auricula," Leddy's environment-
specific audio series.

"Susurrus" premiered in botani-
cal gardens in Glasgow, Scotland,
and the piece has visited gardens
around the world in the last few
years. Glasgow's gardens were par-
ticularly inspirational for Leddy's
play, being a Glasgow resident him-
self.
"The botanics in Glasgow have
quite a mythic position for resi-
dents," Leddy said. "Lots of people
who grew up there would go every
weekend when they were children,
and it has this sort of great power
for them."
He wanted to present the play
in the gardens as part of Glasgow's
Shakespeare festival, so he drew
themes from Shakespeare's "A Mid-
summer Night's Dream," a play that
captivated him when he first saw it
at eight years old.
"I was a very fidgety child -
I'm still a very fidgety adult, but I
apparently watched it with com-
plete, raptured attention. I was
mesmerized by it," he said. "I have
no memory of this at all, but I'm told
that I completely loved it."
He added that "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" works well as inspi-
ration because of its fantasy ele-
ments and that it's set in a forest.
But above all he chose it because
it's his favorite.
"I think you have to go on
instinct with these things," Leddy
explained with a warm smile.
But audience members, who are
admitted into a carefully plotted
path in the garden and set their
own pace in groups of four, don't
need to be familiar with the Shake-
speare play to appreciate "Susur-
rus." It's important to Leddy that
the play be an original work in its
own right.
Although Leddy used 40 to 50
quotes from "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" and worked with some of
the play's themes, including Ober-

on's sensual obsession with the
"changeling Indian boy," he didn't
use any of the same characters, and
the plot is entirely different.
The ultimately dramatic work
containing what Leddy described
as "flashes of humor" has four char-
acters or voices, and centers on a
fictional opera singer rehearsing
for the premiere of Benjamin Brit-
ten's 1960 opera of "A Midsummer
Night's Dream." Itfollows the opera
singer's relationship with his chil-
dren and Britten, and "how those
relationships begin to break apart,"
Leddy said.
"It is a play about intimacy and
relationships and secrets and fam-
ily secrets, and it has the sense of
somebody whispering secrets in
your ear in the middle of the night,"
he added.
Of course, the play uses plenty of
music, starting with Britten's opera
and expanding outward to opera
singerslike Janet Baker and Maria
Callas and popular singers in the
'40s and '50s like Nat King Cole and
Edith Piaf.
The "power of the human voice"
is part of the piece's theme, Leddy
said, particularly the "slightly
super-human quality that opera
singers have to draw out emotions
of other people."
Leddy prefers to experiment
with the elicitation of intense emo-
tional reactions in his theater, as
well as pushing the boundaries of
form. And he isn't worried about
his audience, in Ann Arbor or else-
where.
"I don't know who the audience
is, anywhere really," Leddy said.
"I don't try to communicate with a
particular audience. I think you'd
go a little bit mad if you try to do
that as an artist.
"I make pieces that I want to
make and then try to find the people
who want to see the piece."

HOsrohibitive hit

Scorsese's 'Empire'
is stunning, but lacks
a riveting story
By JAMIE BLOCK
Managing Arts Editor
"Boardwalk Empire" is among
the best new shows of the season
- if not the standalone favorite -
but that does not
make it phenom-
enal. The Martin
Scorcese-direct- Boardwalk
ed series delivers .
on many of the Emr
unspoken prom- Sundays at
ises of an HBO 9p.m.
original series: HBO
an all-star cast
backed by big-
name producers, production value
out the wazoo and a premise here-
tofore unexplored on television.
But HBO struggled just like Steve
on "Blue's Clues," not knowing how
to arrange these three pieces once
it had them all figured out.
We enter a world about to go
parched: Atlantic City in 1920, as
prohibition first seizes its grip on
a country of wastrels, gamblers
and no-good crooks. Our no-good
crook of interest is the city's trea-
surer Enoch "Nucky" Thompson,
for whom Steve Buscemi ("Big
Fish") gives a portrayal as adept as
it is unsettling. Behind his faiade
of public hero - which he main-
tains only for a select few ignorant
women searching blindly for a
champion - Thompson is nothing
more than a ruthless crime boss.
Buscemi is clearly the standout
actor of the cast, as he well should
be in a lead role. But he is closely
followed by Michael Pitt ("The Vil-
lage"). Pitt takes on the personage
of Jimmy Darmody, Nucky Thomp-
son's one-time apprentice who
went off to college and then to war
- quite selfishly, Thompson might
add. Pitt's performance shows the
most emotional depth, as he man-

ages to make Darmody's struggle
to fit back into his own life feel sin-
cerely jarring.
But beyond Pitt and Buscemi, no
actors manage to stand out. That
said, it's not entirely their own
fault. There are just so damn many
of them. We're presented with the
entire city council of Atlantic City,
several officials from other major
cities looking to get in on Thomp-
son's smuggled booze, and all of the
assistants and lackeys those poli-
ticians need to muscle each other
around while keeping it under
wraps. It becomes unmanageable,
and scenes lose their spark in an
instant when the viewer can't even
identify who's on screen. There is

an exception to this problematic
trend though, and he's just a lackey
- well, just a lackey who's name is
unceremoniously revealed to be Al
Capone (Stephen Graham, "Gangs
of New York").
And really, what makes "Board-
walk Empire" captivating at all is
its subtle presentation of the pro-
hibition era and its turbulence.
Where HBO has always succeeded
is not hitting its viewers over the
head with obvious symbols, while
at the same time bringing smaller
details to the fore. A champagne
bottle, popped in celebration of
prohibition's official beginning,
is tossed into a montage, while
Thompson spends a full min-

ute staring through a window as
nurses attempt to save babies born
drastically underweight. And all
this is highlighted by HBO's req-
uisite stunning set and costume
design. Without feeling like they're
being patronized, audiences can
see the 1920s as though they were
living them. They also see that
this Thompson fellow might not
be totally heartless. After all, that
same cruel treasurer who turned
down a drink invitation with "I
already got what I wanted, what
the fuck would we talk about?"
comes to an abused wife's aid -
by having her husband killed.
Nobody's perfect.
And while the writers certainly
pull off strong dialogue and some
gripping events that fit well in the
epoch, they struggle to pull togeth-
er a cohesive, compelling story.
The consequences of everyone's
actions are made clear by the end,
but the plot itself is somewhat of a
blur. A lot of similar men in suits sit
around a lot of similar tables mak-
ing similar business deals, then
some people get shot. None of it is
particularly memorable, but luckily
for "Boardwalk," the show's suc-
cess does not depend solely on the
sensibility of its story.
The real focus of "Boardwalk
Empire" is power. In an era when
political and economic influence
came in a corked bottle, it was
only a matter of time before one
crook smashed the bottle over
the others' heads. "Boardwalk" is
about men trying to maintain the
lifestyle of the affluent emperor,
whatever the cost. As Jimmy Dar-
mody says, "That's what we all
want. At least I got the gumption
to take it." And in this respect,
the series prevails. We get sucked
into a dark, dirty, amoral but well
dressed world where the only
light to see by is the brothel mar-
quee. We meet ruthless, believ-
able and captivating characters,
battling to control this world. But
as it unfolds, that battle is a mud-
dled and forgettable mess.

Maroon 5 remains in pretty-boy pop realm

By ARIELLE SPECINER
DailyArts Writer
Maroon 5 spiced up the summer with its
hit single "Misery," leaving fans wanting
more. With their newest
album, Hands All Over,*
the Los Angeles natives
bring fans out of misery Maroon 5
and into a new collection
of Maroon 5 sounds. Hands All Over
In true A-list pop star A&M/Octane
form, Maroon 5 creates
a captivating tune that,
if their past albums are any evidence, will
soar up the pop charts. "Misery" starts
the album off with a tropical feel, easing
the listener into the record. Lead vocal-
ist Adam Levine's high-pitched melodies
instantly intoxicate as his smooth, but-
tery voice blankets across the track. It's
Levine's captivatingly unique voice that
makes Maroon 5 so easily recognizable.
Adam Levine
explores new genres.
Standout track "Stutter" has a blues-ey
sound that resonates in a handful of songs
on the album. Stadium-ready hooks domi-
nate the track: "Whoa whoa whoa/I really
need to know-oh-oh-oh / Or else you gotta
let me go-oh-oh-oh." Another blues-rock
Maroon 5 rampage is "Hands All Over."

Reminiscent of Maroon 5's biggest single
"Harder To Breathe," Levine sings sexu-
ally charged lyrics dealing with a desper-
ate attempt to coax a distraught, pretty girl
back into his life. While Levine does his
seductive thing, the rest of the gang exper-
iments with dragged-out guitar riffs and
lustful whispers of harmonies.
"How," the album's powerful rock
ballad, is the climax of Hands All Over.
Levine's voice booms across this heartfelt
track with the lingering lyrics, "But I don't
understand the meaning of love / I don't
mind if I die trying / I don't mind if I die
trying."
While Hands All Over may feel similar to
2002's Songs About Jane, it also features a
'70s disco ambiance fused with a Motown
mood that marks a new sound for the band.
Strange combination? Yes, but it works
... mostly.
Tambourine-heavy "Get Back In My
Life" veers toward a disco dance track. The
Jackson 5-inspired song "I Can't Lie" has
a doo-wop candy-counter feel, which could
easily be this album's "Sunday Morning."
Poppy, sunny pianos clink with playful
staccato guitar riff contradicting the mel-
ancholy lyrics, "I just die so much inside
now that you're not there / I wanna feel
your heart beat like yesterday."
With so many genres appearing on
this album, Maroon 5 displays its creative
range. Still, it often seems as if the band
threw together incoherent songs without
much thinking. For example, "Out of Good-
byes," the country-influenced duet featur-
ing Lady Antebellum, not only throws the

Based on this pattern, will the next member of Maroon 5 have long hair or short hair?

album off course, it's just downright for-
gettable.
However, the deluxe version (which
includes a slew of acoustic and live versions
of songs on the standard record) makes
many of the album's not-so-great songs
worth a listen. Stunning acoustic versions
of "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" and

"Misery" are included in the extras. The
acoustic versions of these tracks, which are
significantly better than the album record-
ings, convey the band's pure talent. The
band even takes its shot at covering Alicia
Keys's pop treat "If I Ain't Got You" and
proves its ability to twist any song to make
in sound like their own (though the track

is still comfortable in Maroon 5's main-
stream realm).
Maroon 5's newest album includes the
stadium pop listeners already have a feel
for, while throwing in some curveballs.
HandsAll Over may not be Maroon 5's best
work, but it's good enough that you'll want
to get your hands all over it.

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez had
hoped his team wasn't in need of an
awakening, but after the team's first two
emotionally charged victories, it seemed
almost inevitable.
"You would hope you wouldn't need
that," Rodriguez said Monday. "I think

Some big question marks remain for
Michigan (3-0) on the defensive side of
the ball, but several players were quick
to assure Wolverine fans that they
wouldn't see the same defense against
Bowling Green that they saw against the

more hungry this week."
Preparation will be key for the Michi-
gan's defense as it faces a Falcon team
that, despite its 1-2 record, has averaged
more than 340 yards of offense per game.
Containing that offense may have
become slightly easier when, just before
the fourth quarter last week, Bowling
Green's starting freshman quarterback

Matt Schilz was injured. Schilz will
most likely not play against the Wolver-
ines.
Sophomore Aaron Pankratz finished
the game under center for Bowling
Green last week and went 5-for-8 with a
touchdown and an interception.
Even with their starting quarterback
injured, the Falcons offense remains a
threat. Junior wide receiver Kamar Jor-
den is averaging more than 100 yards per
game this season, and senior running
back Willie Geter has averaged more
than 80 yards per game.
"(We're worried about) all their skill
guys," Rodriguez said. "Their wide
receivers and their running back, I've
been impressed with him. All their big
guys up front ... They do a lot of different
things offensively."
While the defense may have its hands
full with the Bowling Green offense,
Michigan's special teams unit is still
searching for answers.
The Wolverine field goal kickers are a
combined 1-for-5 on the season and both
redshirt freshmen Seth Broekhuizen and
Brendan Gibbons have been struggling
on kickoffs.
After last week's game, Rodriguez
sent out a message to the Michigan stu-
dent body requesting any able-bodied
kicker to come try out for the team.
So far it's been rough going.
"We had one youngster show up
the other day, but he's actually in grad
school," Rodriguez said.
"There have been quite a few who have
shown up, and it's been interesting."
However, Rodriguez reiterated that
he has no doubt Broekhuizen and Gib-
bons can get the job done.
"There's no question in my mind they
can do it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes
it's just a matter of being able to concen-
trate and focus and I think they'll do it
in a game."
INJURY NOTES: Rodriguez said he
will be looking to get some of the other
running backs involved, including the
previously injured redshirt freshman
Fitzgerald Toussaint, who Rodriguez
said should be "ready to go." Redshirt
junior linebacker Brandon Herron and
freshman spur Carvin Johnson will not
play.

Whew. That was close. The Wolverine faithful are hoping
for a much better showing on Saturday against Bowling
Green. The defense will have to improve, but look for the
man they call Flash Dilithium to run roughshod over the
Falcon defense.

8GAME PREVIEW: Michigan's defense will have
its hands full against the Falcons, especially if it
plays like it did last week. And, uh, who will kick
field goals?

2010 Schedule

Connecticut (Sept. 4): Denard ran all over
UConn. He proved he could pass the ball too.
Notre Dame (Sept. 11): After UConn, the ND
game was Denard's encore on steroids, with a
game-winning drive.
Massachusetts (Sept. 18): Michigan squeaked
by the Minutemen last weekend, winning by less -./OS
than a touchdown. A win is a win is a win.
Bowling Green (Sept. 25): Michigan's defense
was thrown into question vs. Massachusetts. It
will have a lot to prove aginst the Falcons.
Indiana (Oct. 2): If Michigan wins a close one
done the stretch again, we fully expect Bill Lynch
to top last year's gum-throwing sideline stunt.
Michigan State (Oct. 9): Mark Dantonio seems
to be in good health after a scary heart attack juste
after the Spartans' win over Notre Dame.

Iowa (Oct. 16): Iowa's Adrian Clayborn may be
the Big Ten's closest replacement for BG. That's
a problem only if he can catch Shoelace.
Penn State (Oct. 30): PSU has a freshman QB.
Michigan knows what that's like. 'Nuff said.
Illinois (Nov. 6): Ron Zook is probably the only
coach in the nation who makes RichRod feel like
his job is secure.
Purdue (Nov. 13): Danny Hope did something
last season RichRod would kill for: beat OSU.
Now, they actually have a quarterback.
Wisconsin (Nov. 20): The Badgers basically
return their entire team. But hey, their last visit
to the Big House went pretty well for Michigan.
Ohio State (Nov. 27): Who knows, maybe
Terrelle Pryor and OSU will have to try and derail
Michigan's title hopes.

"No, he's going to get that educa-
tion," Barry tells them.
Mike always had a soft spot for
Lloyd Carr - ever since that 1997
National Championship game. So on
the day of his official visit to Michi-
gan, Mike sat in awe of the former
Michigan coach. He committed that
day.
He still has a football with an
inscription that reads, "To: Mike, a
Michigan man," signed Lloyd Carr.
So when Carr decided to retire
right before Mike's freshman season
at Michigan, everything started to
unravel. Mike re-opened his recruit-
ment and schools barraged him with
calls. Michigan State and Notre Dame
were hot in pursuit.
Eventually, Notre Dame coaches
were coming to the Detroit Medical
Center, where Theresa worked as a
nurse, and Barry in plant operations.
The Fighting Irish's then-defen-
sive coordinator Corwin Brown and
another defensive coach talked to
Mike's parents about an official visit
at Notre Dame.
When Mike went to visit his girl-
friend at Michigan State, the recruit-
ers would see him and call him to slyly
ask why he was in East Lansing. The
Spartans were trying to get Mike to
take an official visit, too.
He was still undecided when he
drove up to Michigan State with
Coach Mack and his parents to attend
an Elite 8 players banquet at the
Kresge Building. On the way home,
the conversation shifted to Mike's
impending decision.
Mack notices that when Mike
referred to Michigan, he'd say "my
team," and "my school."
Coach Mack caught the slip up.
"What did you just say?" he recalls
blurting out.
Mike never made it to South Bend
or East Lansing.
Mike Rodriguez sees Mike put his
wrestling techniques to good use every
fall Saturday afternoon in a Michi-
gan football uniform. He's seen all of
Mike's 80 tackles, 15.5 tackles for loss
and five sacks that have come in his
first two-plus years as a Wolverine.
To most who watch him, it's as if he
puts on a cape and accomplishes what
mere mortals only dream of.
After his rough loss, Mike didn't
quit wrestling. He didn't let his emo-
tions get the best of him - he stuck it
out.
Soon after that first match, Rodri-
guez sat Mike down. Mike was
beginning to grasp the technique of
wrestling, but there was something
else this heavyweight had to hear.
"The biggest downfall that wres-
tlers have - especially heavyweights
- is fear," Mike Rodriguez said. "So

whenyou getover fear there's nothing
you can't do."
Mike had to unleash himself,just as
he had done in football.
"How many times did your mother
tell you from the time you're (little)
until (now), don't hurt him because
you're so much bigger than everybody
else," Rodriguez asked him.
"All the time coach," Mike respond-
ed.
"So that just stays in your mind,"
Rodriguez said. "You need to be phys-
ical."
Another piece had fallen into place.
Mighty Mike Martin was starting to
understand - he could be unstoppable.
But he had to work at it. He under-
stood what it took to get to that point
in life. Nothing had come easy for
him. He could be a superhero, sure,
but by way of his own power. Not by
a magical potin or a wave of a wand.
So Rodriguez and wrestling coach-
in-waiting Mitch Hancock taught
Mike how to change levels - which
helps Mike get underneath an oppo-
nent and explode. Rodriguez also
taught Mike how to use his hips to his
advantage.
In December of his junior year,
Mike used his newfound knowledge
to take the No. 7 wrestler in the coun-
try into overtime. And even though
Mike lost, 2-1, Rodriguez knew right
then and there, he would be Michi-
gan's state heavyweight champ. He
did just that - in just his first year
competing in the sport.
And he defended that title in his
senior year.
Now, Mike is tormenting opposing
quarterbacks. Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez knows how valuable Mike
is on this year's defense.
"Mike has been outstanding,"

Rodriguez says. "He's played an awful ines' defense has rewritten the record

MIKE MARTIN
From Page 5B
that passion out of Mike.
Hattie coached Mike during his
fifth-and-sixth grade years on the JV
team. He saw from the start that Mike
was a good kid, a sponge you fill up
with information and wring out when
the games started.
But this big kid wasn't being physi-
cal enough to put his size to good use.
"When he found out that he could
block or knock some kid down - and
that was a good thing - he became
really, really good at it," Hattie says.
"He was very emotional, which
actually worked to his advantage
because he didn't like to make mis-
takes. When he did, he got down on
himself, but not to the point where he
would shut down. The next play, he
would go back in there and make the
coach happy."
While being big had its advantages,
Mike also had to worry about being
too big to play - his kryptonite early
on. The CYO weight limit for the area
was 165 pounds for a varsity player
and 135 for aJV player.
Mike wouldn't eat breakfast and
when he was on JV, he would wear
sweatpants and run laps around the
track before games to make weight.
He weighed 200 pounds in June
before his eighth grade year. By the
beginning of August, he had lost that
excess 35 pounds.
"He wouldn't eat because he
wanted to play so bad," Theresa said.
"That's when I knew he was serious."
During Mike's freshman year at
Catholic Central, Eugene Grewe, the
track coach, found him in the weight

room and approached him with a
proposition.
As the coach who dealt with shot
putters and discuss throwers, Grewe
sought big kids with good work ethic
in the weight room. Mike fit the mold.
The two talked about the possi-
bility of Mike joining the track team
that spring, but Mike told Grewe that
he was just too busy that year. Mike
promised him that he would throw
during his sophomore year.
Saying Mike was busy at that time
was an understatement. The fresh-
man was working on advancement
in boy scouts. He was also the No. 1
junior handler for the American Ken-
nel club in 2005.
"Everything he does, he's good at,"
Theresa says. "Everything he touched
turned to gold," Barry adds.
The dog handling was partly his
mother's doing. But he became so
good that he was at one point two
wins shy of making it to Westminster
- the pinnacle of dog shows.
Mike was a regular Johnny Col-
trane, too.
He picked up the alto saxophone
in elementary school, and performed
at school concerts. During his fresh-
man year at Catholic Central, Mike
marched with the band on Friday
night for the varsity game after play-
ing on the freshman team on Thurs-
day night.
Mike eventually made it to the track
team, keeping his promise to Grewe.
In his sophomore year, he had a slow
start with the shot put. He needed to
get his feet wet, just like in his
debut in football.
At his first meet, he threw
the shot 38 feet - "Which is not
horrible for a sophomore, but
for someone who became what
Mike became, it's a pretty meager
beginning," Grewe says. ~

By the end of the season, he threw
farther than 52 feet and was fifth in
the state in Division I in his first year
of competing. He was a state champi-
on the next two years, and his senior-
year throw of 63 feet, 9 niches came
within three inches of breaking T.J.
Duckett's all-time state record.
Grewe noticed that if he saw an
adjustment that would improve
Mike's craft, Mike could make that
adjustment in one practice. In high
school, it would take most a whole
season to adapt like that.
"His work ethic was just unbeliev-
able," Mike Rodriguez said. "I got
upset with him. We work hard and
then (Mike) was taking off and going
in the weight room getting ready for
track season doing the shot put. I fig-
ured he must not be giving 100 per-
cent in this room, because I worked
the hell out of him.
"In his mindset, he wanted to be
something special. And he was. ... In
anything he does, he wants to suc-
ceed and to excel. In order to do that,
he understands how hard he has to
work."
Years later, at Michigan, Mike's
physique is marveled at by team-
mates and coaches. Other players talk
about his work ethic in the weight
room, and the results are on the field.
He has what football experts call a
"motor" - Mike doesn't stop work-
ing on the field.
"Mike Martin is just an animal out
there," sophomore linebacker Craig
Roh said. "He's the strongest person

I've ever seen in the weight room.
It's really showing on the field. He's
taking on double teams. (Against
Massachusetts), I think the play he
sacked the quarterback, he beat a
double team and sacked him. Which
is - stupid."
Every superhero has a sidekick.
Mighty Mike Martin had two - his
parents.
Barry and Theresa never married
after having Mike. He lived with his
mom and she took care of making him
breakfast in the morning and getting
him to school. His dad would pick him
up from school to hang out or go to
one of Mike's various activities.
Though they weren't together,
Mike saw both of his parents every
day.
"That's all that mattered: we were
going to get this kid right, make him a
gentleman," Barry says. "That's what
he turned out to be."
Just last month, Mike couldn't
make his dad's birthday party on
August 20. So he and Barry's fian-
cee planned a surprise party. And
because Mike couldn't make it, he
made a video tribute wishing his
dad a happy birthday. It almost made
Barry cry. Everyone was "damn near
tears."
The maturation process really
started when he made the jump to
Catholic Central - an all-boys Cath-
olic high school in Novi, Michigan.

That's when everything began to click
for Mike.
"It teaches them how to be men,"
Theresa says. "Stuff that I could never
teach him.
"Once he hit high school, he was
just so focused."
"I had people that did a good job
letting me know the right things and
how to do them," Mike said. "I was
around people I wanted to emulate:
their character, how they carried
themselves, just how friendly they
were to me. They just taught me a lot
of things that you just need someone
to show you the way."
At Catholic Central, he developed
many relationships that are still
important to him. Grewe and Babicz
and the rest of his support system
that he built there is still intact. Not
only were they mentors, but they
were Mike's friends. His varsity foot-
ball coach, Tom Mack, said that Mike
has the uncanny ability to relate with
adults and get along with his peers.
His senior year at Catholic Cen-
tral, Mike could have easily quit the
track team as the season extended
deep into the spring. He even missed
a spring break trip with his friends
because of track. He stayed commit-
ted. With great power came great
responsibility.
Now, people are already question-
ing whether Mike will stay all four
years at Michigan. They speculate
that he'll leave early for the NFL Draft
- but they don't know Mighty Mike
Martin very well.

Breakdown: After last week's scare, Blue
looks 'for Big Ten tune-up against Falcons

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily SportsEditor
After a serious hiccup last week
against Massachusetts, the Wolverines
know their defense will have to be sig-
nificantly better with Big Ten season
just on the horizon.
With Bowling Green coming to the
Big House this weekend, Michigan
gets another test game before the Big
Ten conference season starts next
weekend against Indiana.
Luckily for the Wolverines, Fal-
cons' quarterback Matt Schilz will
miss the game with a shoulder inju-
ry. In addition, speedy running back
Willie Geter has struggled in Bowl-
ing Green's first three games. But
these Michigan players, especially
those on defense, won't be gettingtoo
ahead of themselves when it comes to
a lesser opponent.
MICHIGAN RUN OFFENSE VS.
BOWLING GREEN RUN DEFENSE
Junior running back Mike Shaw had
his breakout performance last week,
scampering to a career high in touch-
downs and yards.
And you can bet that Shaw will get
plenty of chances to improve on that
this weekend.
The coaching staff said they hoped
to integrate freshman Stephen Hop-
kins and redshirt sophomore Mike
Cox, at the very least, at some point
against Massachusetts but never got
the chance to do so. They may get the
call this week, and we should still see
sophomore Vincent Smith as well. So
it should be a true committee showing
this week.
The Falcons are nothing to write
home about on the defensive interior,
and the Wolverines should be able to
run with relative ease.
Plus, there's that Denard Robinson
fellow who tends to run the ball quite
a bit.
EDGE: MICHIGAN

MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS.
BOWLING GREEN PASS DEFENSE
In all the doom and gloom from
last weekend, the good news was
that sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson got a chance to display his
passing skills Robinson passed for 241
yards and two touchdowns against the
Minutemen on just 10 completions.
The Falcons have allowed more
than 30 points per game and have been
even worse than the Wolverines on
the other side of the ball this season.
On paper, Michigan should be able to
carve the Bowling Green secondary
like a jack-o-lantern, but the Wolver-
ines are a young team that esuld be
inconsistent, as we saw last weekend
against Massachusetts.
That being said, I fully expect Rob-
inson to improve on his passing yards
from last weekend. But who knows, he
may not even be in the game that long.
EDGE: MICHIGAN
BOWLING GREEN RUN OFFENSE
VS. MICHIGAN RUN DEFENSE
Bowling Green's running back, Wil-
lie Geter, has an interesting combina-
tion of tools, but so far this season, he
hasn't been able toput them all togeth-
er in one game. Geter leads one of the
worst rushing attacks in the nation
into Ann Arbor.
But the Wolverines have been pret-
ty bad defending the run this year,
letting Massachusetts pair of backs
dominate their linebackers all game.
Senior Jonas Mouton has been a bright
spot and sophomore Craig Roh should
bounce back after being one of the
most visibly upset players after last
week's close win.
That intensity should allow the
Michigan rush defense to recover from
by far it's worst performance of the year.

Junior running back Mike Shaw and redshirt junior wideout Junior Hemingway celebrate during Michigan's win over Massachusetts.


Another week, another hold-your-
breath game for the Michigan sec-
ondary. The Falcons won't have their
starter, but Aaron Pankratz, the back-
up, should have an interesting match-
up with an underachieving, yet ornery
secondary.
Pankratz will probably be the least
skilled quarterback the Wolverines
have seen this year (Kyle Havens
looked good last weekend), but you
can't expect Michigan to compete very
often this year in this category.
Plus, with the likes of Kirk Cousins,
Ricky Stanzi and even Terrelle Pryor
on teh docket, it's looking pretty grim
for Michiga.

win this battle, it's this week though

Mike Rodriguez thought for sure that
Mighty Mike Martin had put a dent right in
the middle of the gym floor.
Mike went through his opponent, picked
him wayup in the air and slammed him right
there on the blue mat in the center of the
gymnasium - a tackle of sorts. The crowd
went nuts. Opposing teams hated wrestling
at Detroit Catholic Central, mostly because
of that crowd.
Right there in the middle of the packed
gymnasium stood a massive man, cloaked in
his wrestling singlet. Mike had the power to
do great things. He just didn't know it yet.
Mike's friends, family, teachers and men-
tors were there, everyone was excited to
see what he would do in his first wrestling
match. The whole school was let out an hour
and a half early from class to watch this, the
first match of the season. And the heavy-
weight was the first match drawn, so Mike
was up first. Front and center.
Mike's mother Theresa and father Barry
were there, waiting to see if their son's new-
est pursuit would be a successful one.
Everyone in that gymnasium knew who
Mike Martin the football player was, but
now he was trying his hand at wrestling -
a sport completely different from football,
which he had played since fifth grade.
This was mighty Mike Martin. He could
do anything.
Then the referee's whistle blew. He called
Mike's takedown a slam, which cost him one
point. The crowd sat down in quiet disbelief.
This opponent wasn't too big, and Mike
wasn't intimidated. He knew he could han-
dle him. But Mike was facing a senior who
had been wrestling since junior high.
The savvy senior responded and pinned
Mike with seconds remaining in the match.
Mike didn't know how to get out of a pin just
yet. Mighty Mike Martin had lost.
After the match, Rodriguez, Mike's
wrestling coach, rolled up the mat and
approached his dejected heavyweight.
"You've learned something," Rodriguez
told him. "You've got to work harder."
It was a somber car ride home that evening.
Barry tried to calm his son. He told Mike
everything was going to be all right.
"I know, Dad, but I wasn't supposed to
lose," Mike said desperately. "I wasn't sup-
posed to lose."
"It was embarrassing for him, because
he had high standards for himself," says
Eugene Grewe, Mike's high school English
teacher and track coach. "He kind of wanted
to go out there and make a statement. So it
was frustrating for him. I think he had a
moment of doubt."

Another couple of weeks slipped away,
Thanksgiving came and went. On Black
Friday, Mike had a mid-morning wrestling
practice at the high school. Mike took the
car and went to practice, but returned just
an hour later. His mom knew something
was up.
Mike had had enough. He just wasn't get-
ting it and he let his mom know that. This
was completely different from anything he
had done before and it just wasn't coming
easy to him.
"You gotta stick it out, just give it your
best shot," Theresa told him.
This kid, who would become a superhero
for Michigan at defensive tackle, was caught
in a moment of weakness.
Mike Martin wouldn't quit - would he?
The signs were there, constant remind-
ers to those in his life that he was destined
to be better than average, faster than a
speeding bullet, able to leap across tall
buildings in a single bound and save the
damsel in distress.
But it started with doubt.
When Mike was in the sixth grade, just a
year after he started playing organized foot-
ball, he dreamt about playing in the NFL
someday. When Theresa took Mike to the
pediatrician that year, the doctor tried to
temper his expectations.
"I don't know if you're going to be playing
college ball," the pediatrician said. He knew
the odds were stacked against any kid with
that lofty a goal.
That didn't sit well with Theresa.
"It just made me so mad, people's negativ-
ity to young people," she says. "Because if
you have a dream you should nourish it and
help support it - instead of squashing it. I
know all kids, there's a very small percent-
age that play college ball and from there go
onto the pros, like a one-percent chance. But
if a kid has a dream, you should be there to
support it."
Mike's parents started him in sports at a
young age and tried to encourage him the
best they could.
Mike played baseball - his dad's sport -
at a young age and excelled. After games,
umpires would rave to Theresa and rave
about Mike's arm strength. He was throw-
ing natural curveballs and sliders, they
would say - before the age of 10. But he
didn't stick with baseball or basketball,
which he also tried.
Football was going to be his sport, and
Dan Hattie was the first coach who brought
