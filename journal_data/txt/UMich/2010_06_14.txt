ADMIN IST RATION
'U' could lower rate of
endow-ment spending

Nebraska
joins the
Big Ten
Conference will
increase to 12 schools
on July 1 next year
By TIM ROHAN
Daity Sports Writer
It had been 20 years and seven days,
to be exact, when the Big Ten last
added a school to its ranks.
Back then, Penn State was granted
admission to bring the conference to
11 teams. And last Friday, June 11, the
Big Ten Council of Presidents/Chan-
cellors voted unanimously to accept
the application from the University of
Nebraska to join the conference and
increase the membership to 12.
"The Big Ten Conference has much
te offer," Nebraska Athletic Direc-
tor and former football coach Tom
Osborne said in a press release. "This
is a tribute to eocr athletic program,
ocr academic programs and or fans.
This is the right move at the right
time. This is a rare opportunity that
may not have been an option for us in
the future."
The decision will be effective July 1,
2011, which will allow Nebraska ath-
letics to compete in all sports for the
2011-12 academic year. And regarding
football, with 12 teams, Big Ten com-
missioner Jim Delany told reporters
via teleconference that he expects the
conference to have a championship
game come 2011.
Delany added that three criteria for
placing Big Ten teams into divisions
were, in order: competitive fairness,

Regent says change
to spending rule may
come this summer
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsoEditor
The University's Tioard of
Regents will likely vote this summer
to alter their endowment spending
rule, which dictates how much of the
endowment can be spent each year,
one regent told The Michigan Daily.
Regents have been discussing a

potential change to the University's
endowment spending rule since
April, though very little about their
discussions is known publicly since
they have taken placed. in private
committee meetings.
However, in an interview late
last month, Regent Andrea Fisher
Newman (R-Ann Arbor) told the
Daily that the regents had been dis-
cussing a possible change to the rule,
hinting that a possible decrease may
be forthcoming.
"I think the objective is, if you
were to decrease (the spending rule),
we would want to make sure that the
funding doesn't actually go down,"

Newman said. "You might have a
slight decline if you decreased it, at
least initially, but overall the antici-
pation would be that (the amount
paid out annually) would stay the
same or go up."
For instance, if the University
were to lower the payout by one-half
percent, the endowment may pay out
less money next year. However, rein-
vestment of the additional one-half
percent could increase the net worth
of the University's endowment more
quickly. As a result, future endow-
ment payouts would likely be on par
with or greater than those currently

U' picks new
NCRC leader

Pharmaceutical
research veteran to
oversee former Pfizer
complex
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVAKKARASU
ManagingNews Editor
The University has selected an
executive director to oversee the
North Campus Research Complex,
accordingto a recent University press
release. The appointment comes
a year after the University's pur-
chase of the two million-square-foot
research and development facility
previously owned by Pfizer Inc.
Pending approval from the Univer-
sity Board of Regents, David Canter,
director of health care research at the
non-profit William Davidson Insti-
tute at the University, will be appoint-
ed the NCRC's executive director
starting on July 19.
Canter, who previously led the
Pfizer pharmaceutical research oper-
ation at the current site of the NCRC
until the company ceased its work in
2007, will be charged with the task
of coordinating the use of labora-
tory and manufacturing resources
along with the University's move into
the two million square-foot facility,
according the release.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Canter said his experi-
ence as a project leader on several

drug projects at Pfizer - notably the
development of top-selling drug Lipi-
tor - will help him take on the NCRC
directorship.
"(The experience has) connected
me with pharmaceutical scientists,
toxicologists, chemists, biologists and
made me appreciate how integrated
science needs to be in order to tackle
difficult questions," he said. "Drug
development really is a whole series
of difficult questions that you have to
answer in which no one specialty can
answer them on their own."
Having spent nearly 25 years in
pharmaceutical research, Canter
said he first began to consider the
opportunity to lead the NCRC after a
chance conversation last fall with Ora
Pescovitz, executive vice president
for medical affairs, on the future of
the complex.
"I can think of no one better
suited to guide the development of
NCRC and transform our univer-
sity's approach to multidisciplinary
research and partnership with the
private sector," Pescoyitz said in the
release.
"I have every confidence that with
David Canter's leadership, we will
fulfill the promise that this extraor-
dinary facility holds," echoed Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman in
the release. "He will guide the NCRC
in creating new knowledge and accel-
erating economic growth for our
region."
Canter praised the University's
$108 million purchase of the site as
a "wonderfully bold move," adding

David Canter will be appointed the executive director of the NCRC starting on July 19.

that research is often stymied by an
unwillingness to construct the facili-
ties that can support it.
"It's a capital cost that just inhib-
its many organizations from joining
or wanting to participate," he said.
"Here we don't have that issue-
they're already there. (The buildings)
may need a little renovation, but the
real capital cost is already made."
Canter said because the University
did most of the legwork in purchas-
ing the Pfizer campus, he would first
focus on coming up to speed with
the current progress at the site and
recruiting a small, entrepreneurial
team to help him map out the future
of the complex.
Members of the University
research support staff - some of
whom worked in the former Pfizer
facilities and security teams - have
already moved into NCRC offices,
ronmental quality and site location.
According to the USGBC website,
the Green Building Certification Insti-
tute uses a 110-point scale to deter-
mine if a building qualifies for one of
four levels of certification - certified,
silver, gold or platinum.
The Office of Campus Sustainabil-
ity reported that the University now
pledges that all non-clinical build-
ings and additions with a construc-
tion budget of 10 million dollars or
more will meet the LEED silver certi-
fication standards, meaning they will
earn 50-59 points out of the 110 points
possible.
The new initiative will add to last
year's commitment by the University
to have campus buildings exceed the
national standard for energy efficien-
cy by 30 percent, said Terry Alexan-
der, executive director of OCS.

according to the release. Informa-
tion from the University of Michigan
Health System's website in February
suggested that approximately 125 fac-
ulty and 450 staff members will also
move into the site.
After what he called a deliberate
decision to move on from pharma-
ceutical research and development,
Canter said his work in the William
Davidson Institute was eye-opening
to the rigors of an academic setting.
The experience, he said, would be
invaluable in developing the NCRC
beyond its potential as a laboratory
and manufacturing site.
"We call it the North Campus
Research Center, but it's going to
have to be much more than that," he
said. "It's going to really be a part of
the University with education, with
students, part of the medical school
and service as its mission."
To kick-start the University's ini-
tiative, the new Mott Children's and
Women's Hospital and the new law
school addition, which are both cur-
rentlyunder construction, are en route
to LEED silver certification, according
to the Office of Campus Sustainability.
The North Quad Residence Hall,
which is set to open this fall, has been
under construction for about two
years but is not a LEED-certified proj-
ect.
Alexander said the primary benefit
of this new standard will be having an
outside source recognize the Univer-
sity's efforts to promote sustainability.
"The biggest change is probably
that buildings will now be certified
by a third party organization as being
environmentally sustainable," Alex-
ander said. "From the aspect of get-

'U' research grows
cells on new matrix

WORLD CUP FEVER

University researchers
develop synthetic cell
matrix for stem cell
cultures
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Two University researchers may
have developed a new way to success-
fully cultivate stem cells by changing
their direct environment rather than
their biological properties.
Gary Smith, an associate profes-
sor in the department of obstetrics
and gynecology, and Joerg Lahann,
an associate professor in the chemi-
cal engineering department, recently
led a team of researchers to develop a
synthetic cell matrix to facilitate cell
cultures and avoid contamination that
could affect the function of growing
stem cells.
First isolated in 1998, human
embryonic stem cells have only been
under the microscope for about 12
years. Smith said some aspects of hES
cell growth, which make it better
suited to research applications rela-
tive to mouse embryonic stem cells
and human adult stem cells, remain a
mystery.
"The actual requirements of the
(hES) cell are not fully understood,"
he said.
Smith added that he and Lahann
grow the hES cells on synthetic poly-
mer surfaces instead of the traditional
gels made from ground-up animal cells
or animal-derived fibroblasts, which
are connective tissue cells that secrete
extracellular matrices.
Smith referred to the animal-
derived surfaces as "undefined" insol-
uble components, because the cell
secretions and cell-to-cell interactions
that occur among animal cells cause
variability in the components of the
surface.
"What (anundefined insoluble com-
ponent) does is it causes ... problems
with not knowing exactly what is in
the culture environment," he said.
For instance, using mice skin cells
to form the insoluble component can
cause hES cells to take up the proteins
from the mice cells, Smith said. This
uptake of foreign biological matter, he
added, makes it difficult to determine
if apparent characteristics of hES cells
are actually due to the mice cell pro-
teins.
To avoid this type of uncertainty in

the observed needs and behaviors of
hES cells, Smith and Lahann are turn-
ingto artificial, or "defined," surfaces.
"(Using a defined insoluble com-
ponent) makes it much easier to test
and define what are the requirements
of hES cells and what actually regu-
lates differentiation," Smith said. "The
long-term benefit is (that) removing
undefined contaminates from hES cell
growth is going to facilitate the ability
to use hES cells in the future for clini-
cal research."
To test a defined insoluble com-
ponent, Smith said he and his team
allowed the cells to grow for seven
days and then "passage" the cells to a
new dish, where they grow for another
seven days before repeating the pro-
cess until the cultured cells cease to
divide.
Smith said he and Lahann started
with eight different test surfaces -
three of which successfully anchored
the cells. Cells from two of the three
remaining cultures differentiated of
their own accord, rendering the cul-
tures useless for the purposes of hES
cell research. The one test surface that
the cells successfully attached to and
grew on undifferentiated, Smith said,
has supported cell growth for up to 40
passages.
Smith said the next step in their
research, in addition to extending the
growing period of the cells, is to derive
their own line of hES cells. The current
cells they use, he said, are all federally
approved lines grown on fibroblasts -
an undefined insoluble component.
Proposal 2, which was passed in
November 2008 by Michigan voters,
currently allows researchers to derive
their own lines of hES cells under cer-
tain restrictions. Notably, the propos-
al mandates that the cells are created
for the purpose of fertility treatment,
that they are donated by the person
seeking treatment and that they are
either in excess or unsuitable for clini-
cal use.
"Once we have the hES cell line that
we have derived under fully-defined
conditions, then we have something
that has not ever been done before and
then we can start testing if the cells
that are derived and grown on an (ani-
mal-derived surface) are any different
than the ones grown in a fully defined
manner," Smith said.
Smith stressed the importance of
interdisciplinary research, saying that
his research with Lahann could not
have been accomplished without their
combined knowledge in biology and
chemical engineering.

Patrons at Conor O'Neill's pub watch Germany play against Australia at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Germany won its match, scoring tour
goals against Australia, which scored none.


"This is actually a perfect, perfect
example ofsomethingthatin mylab we
could not have done alone ... and some-
thing that in Lahann's lab he could not
have done alone. It really took a col-
laboration of different disciplines and
different people and different ideas to
make this work," Smith said. "To me
that's the exciting part about it."
Smith, Lahann and several co-
authors wrote a paper on their research
called "Synthetic polymer coatings for
long-term growth of human embryon-
ic stem cells," which was published last
month in the online journal Nature
Biotechnology.

The LEEDers and best
Silver certification should be a baseline, not the final goal
The University has a subpar record on environmental friendliness.
But last week, the administration took a positive step in announc-
ing that all of its future construction projects would meet at least a
LEED-silver certification level. This commitment is commendable, but con-
sidering that some colleges and corporations are committing themselves to
carbon neutrality, it's clear the administration could still do more. If the
University is to be a world leader in both research and social responsibility,
it should aim to attain the highest standard of environmental sustainability.

When I learned that law-
makers on Capitol Hill
were seeking to gut the
Office of Congres-
sional Ethics, only{
one thing crossed<
my mind: It's about
damn time.1
I realize that
I might be in the '
minority on this,
but bear with me.
I, like most Ameri- NOEL
cans, believe that all GORDON
of our elected offi-
cials should be held
to a higher ethical standard because
of the power entrusted to them by our
votes. At the same time, I also know
that politicians are human and that
there needs tobe some type of mecha-
nism in place to ensure that abuses
of power are punished to the fullest
extent of the law. But it seems to me as
though many of the offices and com-
mittees charged with this simple task
are failing their mission.
The Office of Congressional Eth-
ics is an independent, non-partisan
committee charged with reviewing
allegations of misconduct against
members of the House of Representa-
tives and their staff. It's governed by
an eight-person Boardof Directors of
private citizens that cannot work for
the government or serve as members
of Congress. While I think the Office
of Congressional Ethics is a good idea
on paper, for a number of reasons, it
just doesn't seem necessary.
First and foremost, the OCE refers
all appropriate cases to the United
States House Committee on Stan-
dards of Official Conduct, which
essentially does all of the same
things as the OCE. So, in effect, there
are two separate entities perform-
ing the same exact jobs, doubling the
cost of ethics oversight to taxpayers.
Moreover, the OCE has an absurd
amount of discretion when it comes
to handling allegations of abuse and
misconduct that the official House
committee does not. It can initiate
investigations based on unsubstanti-
ated complaints or news reports and
publicize its findings even if a case
proves to be fruitless.
These privileges alone should
be cause for alarm, as it essentially
means that I could make up an alle-
gation about a representative I don't
like, submit it anonymously to the
OCE and wait for the reputation-
damaging circus that is an eth-
ics investigation. Though I'm sure
this isn't something that happens
every day, the fact remains that this
amount of leniency lends itself quite
easily to both wasteful investigations
and wasted taxpayer dollars.

But above all else, my biggest issue
with the Office of Congressional Eth-
ics is one that can be applied elsewhere
in Washington. Investigators need to
do a much better job of distinguish-
ing a professional ethics violation
from a personal one. Nothing irritates
me more than seeing a member of the
House of Representatives request a
hearing because someone from the
opposing party cheated on his or her
spouse. Suchaction, whilehorrible and
worth condemnation, are not grounds
for an ethics probe.
Professional and
private violations
are not the same.
Now I'm not saying that we should
suddenly ignore the fact that a con-
gressman or senator cheated on his
wife. After all, such an act suggests
a disregard for honesty and virtue,
both of which are characteristics I
think most of us want in a politician.
But a clearer line needs to be drawn
between what is and is not an ethics
violation. It was definitely the right
call to launch an investigation into
allegations made against Represen-
tative Eric Massa (D-N.Y.), since he
allegedly used his position to sexually
harass and then intimidate his aides.
But I think that is completely differ-
ent from the huge deal being made
about Senator John Ensign (R-Nev.),
who cheated on his wife because he
apparently had other things on his
mind than legislation.
Ethical probes should only be
launched when an elected official is
suspected of either breaking the law
or hiding his or her actions. But that
doesn't seem to be happening these
days. Investigations seem to be start-
ing at the drop of a hat in this con-
tentious political climate, and that is
simply unfair to both the American
people and our elected officials.
We deserve a government that
works tirelessly to fix the problems
facing our country. But we are enti-
tied to a government that is prudent
about which allegations it spends its
precious time and money investigat-
ing. I suspect there'll be a lot of talk
about cleaning up Washington in the
coming weeks as Election Day draws
nearer and nearer. I just hope that
those same people start realizing
that some ethical lapses must take
priority over others.

A project of the nonprofit U.S.
Green Building Council, Lead-
ership in Energy and Environ-
mental Design (LEED) provides
its certification to buildings that
meet its eight standards of envi-
ronmental friendliness at the
certified, silver, gold or platinum
levels. These standards include
energy and water use as well as
materials used and location. Two
University buildings, the Ross
School of Business and the Dana
Building, are already silver and
gold certified, respectively. The
new Mott Children's and Von
Voigtlander Women's Hospital
and the law school addition are
also expected to meet some level
of LEED certification. North
Quad, however, is not.
The University is right to rec-
ognize the importance of envi-
ronmental sustainability. The
threat of climate change is a pow-
erful reminder of the very real
impact humans can have on the
planet and its resources. An insti-
tution of the vision and prestige of

this university should know that,
in the long-term, sustainability
won't be a choice - protecting
the environment now is the only
way to be able to continue using
it later. As Michigan's flagship of
higher education, the University
should act as a model, setting an
ambitious and unparalleled stan-
dard for environmental steward-
ship. Adopting a policy of LEED
certification is an important step
toward doing just that.
But avague policy for silver cer-
tification on "major" construction
projects won't make the Univer-
sity the leader it needs tobe. Uni-
versity policy should clearly and
forcefully dictate what consti-
tutes a "major" construction proj-
ect and have similarly stringent
policies for more minor projects.
And whatever the language of
the policy, administrators should
consistently seek to go above and
beyond its requirements. If the
University is to be an environ-
mental leader on the internation-
al stage, it must relentlessly strive

to out-green its own standards.
That's why silver-certification
should be the University's base-
line, not its final goal. It's true
that the University has made an
impressive commitment to green
building by this recent action.
Even before the adoption of its
new LEED-silver policy, the Uni-
versity plans to exceed national
energy use standards by 30 per-
cent. But other colleges, like Mid-
dlebury College in Vermont, for
example, have committed to com-
plete carbon neutrality. LEED-
silver is a great stepping-stone,
but it falls far short of placing
the University at the forefront of
the environmental sustainability
movement - a place an institution
with the University's resources
should invariably hold.
Only setting that kind of inter-
national example is acceptable
for this institution. And the way
to do that is by striving for the
top certification on all construc-
tion projects, not settling for
third-best on most.

A red cardfor cost?

It's now that time that occurs
once every four years when
soccer actually becomes pop-
ular in America.
And like many of
my peers, I will
pay marginally
more attention
to soccer than
usual by watch-
ing the occa-
sional highlights ERIC
on SportsCenter. STULBERG
But the World
Cup is much more than just a
soccer tournament - it's a huge
investment in South Africa that
will have enormous economic and
sociopolitical impact. And in a
nerdy way so typical of University
students, I think these results of
the Cup will be much more inter-
esting than whether Spain can
fend off Brazil or France.
Let's delve into the numbers.
According to an estimate made by
the consulting firm Grant Thorn-
ton, the World Cup will infuse
South Africa's economy with $7.6
billion, attract 490,000 tourists
and create or save 415,000 yearlong
jobs. But these are just the resultant
benefits - there are many costs as
well. South Africa built ten new
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums at
a hefty price tag, and they will also
absorb increased costs from con-
struction, beautification and labor.
As noted by Rob Baade, an econom-
ic analyst of major sporting events,
the construction and beautification
process has historically lowered the
revenues of many local businesses
prior to the World Cup due to gen-
eral infrastructure disruption.
Ultimately, both critics and
advocates of the World Cup as
an economic boon agree that the
impact will depend on how every-
thing plays out. If the event can cre-
ate a spike in tourism and security
that sustains itself for the follow-
ing years, then it will ultimately be
a success. If the World Cup turns
away potential non-Cup-related
tourists and only provides a tem-
porary boost, then it will hurt the
South African economy. More sig-
nificantly, many experts both from
inside and outside of South Africa
argue that the money invested into
the World Cup could have been
invested into social problems, like
the high HIV/AIDS rate, and debate
whether the revenue from the
World Cup will allow for greater
social spending.
With that said, while I don't
have access to a crystal ball - or
an accurate calculus-based model
- that can predict the long-term

consequences of the World Cup,
just a few years ago Detroit hosted
the world cup of "real" football, and
its long- term impact can be seen
today. Detroit directly made $125
million from the Super Bowl from
the estimated $100 million of public
and private money spent on prepa-
ration costs.
The World Cup
might not be an
economic "goal."
While the economic impact of
the Super Bowl definitely helped
Detroit in the short term, there
seems to have been no sustained
benefit. Today, Detroit still has
unfinished and postponed con-
struction and beautification proj-
ects, which all have maintenance
costs in addition to the initial Super
Bowl preparation costs. Making
matters worse, they create eyesores
that hurt the perception of Detroit
by suburbanites and tourists, which
harms propertyvalues.
Detroit's economy invariably
suffered from the massive recession
that struck the nation as a whole, sot
the Super Bowl cannot be blamed
for its downward spiral. Yet while
the event may not have objectively
hurt the city, it certainly didn't
help. The recession still ravaged the
unemployment rate, with unem-
ployment in the Detroit-Warren-
Livonia area rising from 7.2 percent
in February 2006, the month of
the Super Bowl, to 15.5 percent in
March 2010. And tourism in Detroit
has hardly taken off in the last four
years, with most news sources still
citing Detroit as one of the top five
most dangerous cities in the coun-
try. At best, the Super Bowl slightly
stimulated the economy of Detroit,
only for its benefit to be neutralized
by the recession. At worst, it hurt
the city by creating unsustainable
infrastructure projects and not pro-
viding any new, long-term jobs.
Like Detroit, South Africa
is plagued by a high crime and
unemployment rate. I hope that
South Africa, unlike Detroit, will
be able to sustain whatever ben-
efits it can reap from the World
Cup and that its tourism industry,
already a pillar of its economy, will
grow exponentially once the last
goal is scored.

Recruit responsibly
Poor communication creates another embarrassment

On the heels of the first major
NCAA violations in the history of
the program, the University's foot-
ball team is again in the headlines
for questionable practices. After
being offered a spot on the team,
recruit Demar Dorsey was told
that he would not be admitted to
the University. This incident illu-
minates an exceedingly clear lack
of communication between the
football program and University
administration. If the football pro-
gram, and by extension the Univer-
sity, want to be taken seriously, they
must more effectively coordinate
their recruitment operations with
the admissions office.
Since 2007, Demar Dorsey has
been charged with involvement
in at least three separate counts of
burglary, at least two of which he
confessed to. Instead of being con-
victed, Dorsey was sent to an alter-
native juvenile program. In school,
Dorsey struggled before dropping
out and enrolling in an alternative
program called LifeSkills, where
his grades and test scores dramati-

cally improved. While there has
been some dispute over the facts
and order of events, it's known
that football coach Rich Rodriguez
offered Dorsey a scholarship to play
at the University before he enrolled
at LifeSkills, and that, in turn,
Dorsey signed a Letter of Intent,
preventing him from looking at
other schools. Recently, however,
the admissions office sent a letter
notifying Dorsey that he would not
be admitted and that he was no lon-
ger bound by the LOI.
There have been several con-
flicting reports about whether
Rodriguez actually consulted the
admissions office before offering
Dorsey a scholarship. But what-
ever the case may be, the episode
reinforces the disconnect between
the football program and the Uni-
versity administration. Ironically,
this comes after an already embar-
rassingly public investigation into
NCAA rule violations, when Ath-
letic Director Dave Brandon prom-
ised more transparency and better
communication between the ath-
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

letic department and varsity teams.
Clearly, this promise has gone
unfulfilled. The Dorsey case is rep-
resentative of an intrinsic, recur-
ring and problematic detachment
between these two entities.
The shameful nature of this
incident will likely harm the Uni-
versity's recruitment of future stu-
dent-athletes. By offering Dorsey a
place on the team, Rodriguez cre-
ated an expectation that he would
be admitted to the University
itself - an offer that should never
have been made considering Dors-
ey's history and lack of academic
credentials. But the turnaround
engenders a far broader concern:
It calls into question the legiti-
macy of any offer by the athletic
department to a student-athlete
on the border of the University's
academic standards.
The whole ordeal has dealt yet
another blow to the football pro-
gram's already ailing reputation.
But ultimately, it reflects a larger
pattern of poor coordination and
communication that must end.

Daily story on public
art misled readers
TO THE DAILY:
On June 1, 2010, an article was
published in this paper on the public
art project "Vessels" (Visiting art-
ist discusses challenges of installing
public art at the 'U'). It is my conten-
tion that in this article words were
poorly chosen, leading to a mischar-
acterization of my statements, and
undermining the whole intent of
the project, which was to help build
bridges between the various agencies
dealing with public art in Ann Arbor.
The headline set the tone by stating,
"Visiting artist criticizes bureau-
cracy in public art." The article
then goes on to say that artists like
me were "stymied" in this process;
clearly stacking the deck for how one
should interpret my experience with
bureaucracy in Ann Arbor.

It is hardly newsworthy, but
bureaucrac~y is a challenge for any art-
work that goes into a public space. At
times the process was daunting, and
some aspects of the bureaucracy were
particular to Ann Arbor. However,
my comments were never intended
as criticism; they were statements of
fact when doing a public art project.
In presenting those facts I also
made clear statements aimed at
counterbalancing the difficulties; yet
strangely, and I would argue inten-
tionally, none of these comments
appeared in the article. I pointed out
that everyone involved in the bureau-
cratic process had been helpful and
did not state that there was anyone
actively undermining the project. I
mentioned that people on the vari-
ous committees also have full-time
jobs and therefore can only meet to
discuss these matters at monthly
meetings. I explained that everyone
had learned from the experience, and
that this project might actually stand

as a model for future cooperation
between these agencies.
I also suggested that this project
might help to reduce the whole pro-
cess to a shorter timeframe. I gave
examples of how a website is being
set up at the University to help facili-
tate the process so that future vis-
iting artists might be able to work
through some of the steps before
coming to Ann Arbor. Finally, I men-
tioned that in choosing the Huron
River I made extra problems for
myself because it overlapped with
three levels of bureaucracy: the city,
the state and the University, thereby
tripling the normal difficulties one
encounters in a project like this.
These statements suggest an under-
standing of the bureaucratic process,
not, as the article portrayed, a blan-
ket criticism of local bureaucracy.

And while Newman would not
definitively say that the regents were
planning to lower the endowment
payout rule, she said they would likely
vote on a change this summer.
"I think it will probably come
before the Board in June or July,"
Newman said.
= If the change is to go into effect
for the upcoming year, the June tim-
ing would coincide with the Board of
Regents' approval for the University's
2010-2011 budget and student tuition
rates, which is scheduled to take place
later this week.

ting a more sustainable building, this
decision doesn't really get you a lot...
We were already pretty green in our
building aspects."
He added that the previous stan-
dard for sustainability in University
construction already brought build-
ings about 75 percent of the way to the
new LEED silver standard.
Peggy Matta, the chair of the Green
Schools Committee for the Detroit
regional chapter of the USGBC, said
having an outside source confirm the
University's efforts in creating a sus-
tainable campus is a valuable form of
validation.
"(It's important to have) somebody
that's not you corroborating the fact
that you've built the building to the
design standards you say you have,"
Matta said. "There are other green
systems out there but they're all self-
certifying ... but that doesn't go far
enough we think."
To stress the importance of green
buildings, the USGBC website reports
that buildings are responsible for 38.9
percent of primary energy use, 38
percent of carbon dioxide emissions,
72 percent of electricity consumption
and 13.6 percent of potable water use
in the U.S.
LEED-accredited professional Jan
Culbertson is a senior principal at A3C
Collaborative Architecture located on
East Huron Street in Ann Arbor.
Culbertson said when she and part-
ner Dan Jacobs first ventured into the
world of sustainable architecture in
the 1970s, the concept was more of a
"counterculture" idea. Now, she said,
designing buildings to "perform" to
certain standards of sustainability is
becoming the norm.
"(The USGBC) transformed the
whole construction industry by pro-
viding that rating system," she said.
"There's this demand for green build-
ings and (they're) driving it."

Both the budget and tuition rates
can be affected by the amount of
money available from the University's
endowment, which partially pays for
a wide variety of expenses at the Uni-
versity, including student financial aid
and program support in certain areas
across campus.
According to the University's Office
of Public Affairs and Media Relations'
website, the endowment contributed
$244 million to help cover expenses
in the University's budget last year.
The agenda for the University's
Board of Regents June meeting this
Thursday will be posted online at
noon today.
Asked about the topic last week,
University spokeswoman Kelly Cun-
ningham declined to comment on
Prior to this new commitment, the
University had already received two
LEED certifications for campus build-
ings - a gold certification in 1994 for
the Dana Building, home of the School
of Natural Resources and Environ-
ment, and a silver certification earlier
this year for the new Stephen M. Ross
School of Business. Both of those cer-
tifications, however, were based on
an older rating system, whereas new
construction will meet the silver stan-
dard of the new system, dubbed LEED
2009, according to Alexander.
Culbertson said the new system
enforces prerequisites that buildings
must meet in order to even qualify for
certification, including pollution pre-
vention during construction, a 20-per-
cent water use reduction, a 10-percent
improvement in energy efficiency over
the national standard, storage and col-
lection of recyclables and a no-smok-
ing policy both inside the building and
within a certain distance outside the
building.
Culbertson added that the new
system also weighs points differently
in a way that emphasizes energy effi-
ciency and carbon dioxide emissions
reduction, and it offers bonus points
for buildings that address regionally
specific environmental priorities.
Alexander said the improvements
of LEED 2009 are partially why Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Coleman
and the Environmental Sustainability
Executive Council made this commit-
ment.
"There's been kind of this building
momentum over the years and when
their version 2009 came out and we
looked at it, it really is a much more
improved system over the earlier ver-
sions," Alexander said.
The School of Natural Resources
and Environment website details the
numerous technologies and materials
used in the "greening of Dana" that
make the building a prime example of
a sustainable building, including the
use of solar power, a radiant cooling
system, insulation, mechanical and

the topic, saying she couldn't confirm
anything about the potential change.
The University's endowment cur-
rently pays out five percent of its
overall value annually. However, the
University's total endowment value
is determined by a seven year rolling
average calculated at the end of every
fiscal quarter, which means that the
percent paid out of the endowment
may be slightly more or less than five
percent of its current marketvalue.
The University's seven year rolling
average procedure replaced a three
year rolling average procedure in
2006 as a way to provide more stable
payouts against market unpredict-
ability. Prior to its three year rolling
average policy, the University paid out
the full interest earned on its invest-

ments.
In an April interview, University
President Mary Sue Coleman said dis-
cussions around the topic were a rou-
tine evaluation based on prior action
taken by the University's Board of
Regents.
"We changed from a three year
rolling average to a seven year roll-
ing average about four years ago,"
Coleman said in April. "And so in that
action item, we did four years ago,
we said periodically we wanted to go
back and look at just the rule itself of
five percent, so that's the discussion
we've been having."
In the same interview, Coleman
said in evaluating the spending rule,
it's important to keep in mind that
the endowment serves not only the

University's current needs but also its
future ones.
"We're trying to balance paying
for the future with providing enough
money for the units today and that's a
tricky balance," Coleman said.
However, at the time, Coleman
would not say whether an increase or
decrease would be more likely.
In an interview on the same day,
Tim Slottow, executive vice president
and chief financial officer, also refused
to state explicitly whether an increase
or decrease might be forthcoming.
However, until asked about the pos-
sibility of increasing the University's
endowment payout, Slottow only dis-
cussed the possibility of a decrease,
adding that it might make more sense
for the University at the present.

Construction at the University Law School will be certifed as a LEED silver project.

electrical systems that are control-
lable in individual work spaces, dual
flush toilets, sensor-activated faucets
and low-flow plumbing fixtures.
Alexander said the Dana building
costs slightly more to maintain than
is expected for future construction
projects.
"We do have a little history on Dana
on the cost to maintain some of the
systems," he said, "and it is a little bit
higher because we've got things like
composting toilets that we normally
don't deal with ... so the cost goes up
there."
He added that some of the more
standard ways to achieve LEED cer-
tification like having extra insulation
and using more efficient fan systems
won't substantially affect mainte-
nance costs.

According to Alexander, the only
major opposition to the new initiative
is fueled by worry over increased con-
struction costs, which he estimated
would be about a two-to-four-percent
increase.
"In this day and age, cost is always
something you have to overcome," he
said. "The decision was made that the
benefits outweighed the costs."
Culbertson said the increased con-
struction costs will be more than
compensated in the long run through
money-saving sustainable technology.
According to the USBGC website,
an investment of about two percent
of construction costs in green build-
ing design will ultimately result in an
overall saving of about 20 percent of
the total construction costs over time.
Culbertson said this type of major

commitment to sustainability in
buildings is not groundbreaking and,
in fact, has become quite popular and
continues to grow.
"It's the way we should be building
anyway," she said.

Grads create
feedback site

Recent University
alums host website for
users to vote on fashion
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor locals in search of spe-
cific fashion and style advice before
a job interview, first date, or a night
out may not have to look further than
their own computers.
The desire to get feedback about
one's appearance and style sparked
three recent University graduates to
create a new website called DTLOK.
com - Does This Look Okay? - which
allows people to post pictures and get
constructive feedback about their
appearance and style.
LSA graduate Drew Tevrizian said

he originally came up with the idea
for the new site, which allows people
to leave comments and vote on photos,
after growing up with a sister who
was interested in fashion and noticing
how much people desired feedback
for their choices in clothing.
Tevrizian said he has no knowledge
of fashion, so he enlisted the help of
his friend and Business School gradu-
ate Michael Eichberg.
In need of someone able to code
DTLOK.com, Tevrizian said he used
Craigslist to hire John Gorman for
the position. Tevrizian added that
Gorman has been "the backbone of
the website," because of his voluntary
work on getting the site up and run-
ning.
After three months of work, the site
launched Apr. 1, and it received 8,000
hits on its first day, primarily from

around the Ann Arbor area.
The website is currently attract-
ing about 300 visits per day, partly
due to advertising around the Univer-
sity campus and peer encouragement,
Tevrizian said. The website's traffic,
he said, has spread beyond the Ann
Arbor area anymore but rather it has
spread to other cities, including some
from around the world.
DTLOK.com relies on Facebook
and Twitter for online advertising,
but Tevrizian said word-of-mouth
advertising has been most effective in
drawing hits to the site.
Gorman said he believes DTLOK.
com has been so successful because
of the idea itself and how insecure
and vain people can be. The website,
he said, offers an outlet for people to
receive anonymous feedback about
their appearance, like ways in which
they could improve their outfits.
"It's not meant tobe superficial, it's
meant to be a boost of confidence,"
Eichberg said.
For those who are new to a city
and don't have anyone to get feedback
from, the site acts "like your second
friend," Eichberg said.
In order to use this website, visi-
tors do not need to create an account.
Instead they will need to provide an
officers arrest him.
Beatty was arrested and released
Jan. 13 after being pulled over by Ypsi-
lanti police with an open container
and an unspecified amount of cocaine
in his car, according to AnnArbor.com.
The arrest was made by Ypsilanti
police and members of LAWNET,
according to a Jan. 30 article in The
Michigan Daily.
After being released, Beatty was
placed on unpaid administrative leave

Jones said. "Whereas modern mov-

to happen," he added. "If you expect
things to happen you'll be disap-
pointed because not a whole lot hap-
pens in terms of action.
"But there's a lot of emotional
content. And that I think is very
easily appreciated by almost any-
body."

the end. Thus, in what has largely been
a forgettable year for the blockbuster,
"The Karate Kid" may well be the best
that summer 2010 has to offer - even
if it falls well short of the original.
The film stars Jaden Smith (most
memorably seen alongside his famous
father Will in "The Pursuit of Happy-
ness") as Dre, a Detroit youngster who
has to move to China with his mother.
Apart from its changed setting and
character names, the story closely
resembles that of the original: Dre
meets a girl in Beijing, but some mean
bullies keep messing with him every
time hetries to talk to her.
After one particularly painful
beatdown, Dre is rescued by Mr. Han
(Jackie Chan), the local maintenance
man, who happens to be a secret kung
fu master. Dre asks Han to teach him
kung fu, and Han agrees after seeing
firsthand the ruthless philosophy the
local kung fu master is passing along
to his students - who happen to be
the same kids tormenting Dre. After
many painful training sessions, with
the usual underdog-story angst and
adversity, Dre competes in a kung fu
tournament, facing and defeating the
bad guys.
For all the film's shameless cli-
ches, it's made watchable, and
occasionally enjoyable, by superb per-
formances from its two stars. Smith's

performance is fresh, energetic and
surprisingly believable. That he has
the same mannerisms and some-
thing reminiscent of the swagger that
made his father one of the world's big-
gest movie stars certainly can't hurt.
Young Jaden even drops a hip-hop
track on the film's soundtrack, as Will
Smith did in so many of his biggest
hits. (Regrettably, the track also fea-
tures Justin Bieber, but still.)
And Chan, as he has done in nearly
every recent role of his, brings a good
deal ofgrace and solemnity, along with
unmatched kung fu skills. Although
his role is hampered by a needlessly
meandering character backstory, Han
is a worthy replacement for the vener-
able Mr. Miyagi - humble and under-
standing, but also funny and blunt
when needed.
With a grueling runtime of nearly
140 minutes - well beyond the atten-
tion span of the film's key demograph-
ic - "The Karate Kid" nearly exhausts
the considerable charm of its stars
and the patience of its audience before
Dre's kung fu training even begins.
But when the uplifting, musically
enhanced scenes of sap and sentiment
finally appear, viewers will be all too
willing to cheer out loud.
It's clear, then, that "The Karate
Kid" is a film to love, even if it isn't all
that good.

Dorsey denied admission to the U'

Five-star recruit
signed papers that
released him from
Letter of Intent
By MARK BURNS
Daily SportsEditor
"You have to look at the whole story
before you pass judgment on a young
man," Michigan football coach Rich
Rodriguez said after five-star recruit
and defensive back Demar Dorsey
signed with the Wolverines on Feb. 3,
2010. "Not everybody is perfect. Some-
times young people get in the wrong
situation at the wrong time, but they're
found innocent or they're acquitted. We
feel comfortable that every guy we sign
is going to be a great fir for not only the
football program but for this university
and our community."
"Every kid we recruit, we spend an
awful lot of time, probably more than
anything on character," offensive coor-
dinator Calvin Magee said at the time.
"Just like the other kids we recruited,
we saw a kid that has good character
and we had no problems with it."
From both statements, both Rodri-
guez and Magee believed Dorsey's
prior encounters with the law could
be overlooked - even though he was
charged with two felonies, a burglary
of an unoccupied dwelling in 2007
and a robbery with a deadly weapon
in 2008.
And despite Dorsey's non-con-
viction in both cases, the Office of
Admissions still refused to grant him
NEBRASKA
From Page 1
"I think it's a phenomenal fit, aca-
demically, athletically, culturally,"
Delany said of Nebraska in an inter-
view with the Big Ten Network.
It has been widely discussed that
the reason for expansion is to extend
the reach of the Big Ten Network and
generate even more money for new
and existing Big Ten schools.
With Nebraska, the Big Ten is
getting a Midwest, blue collar-type
school in the same mold as the Wis-
consins and the Iowas that are already
0 linchpins in the conference.
The move makes sense for Nebras-
ka, too.
"We're obviously not (located) in
the Sun Belt," Osborne said at a press
conference. "And we find some of our
sports at a disadvantage because of

admission into the University last
Wednesday.
Dorsey signed and returned docu-
ments that released him from his Let-
ter of Intent.
According to a statement posted by
the University's website shortly after
the announcement, "A Letter of Intent
is not a guarantee of admission, and
student-athletes are told they must
meet not just NCAA but also U-M
requirements. If student-athletes
meet NCAA eligibility requirements,
they are not automatically admitted
to the U-M."
Dorsey's high school coach at Boyd
Anderson, Mark James, was quoted by
ESPN.com last Monday saying Dorsey
had met NCAA requirements pertain-
ing to his ACT score and grade-point
average.
But while he may have academi-
cally qualified to attend Michigan, the
Office of Admissions has the final say
whether or not a student or student-
athlete is granted final admission to
the University.
The Statement on Admissions and
Student-Athletes continues by say-
ing, "All undergraduate admissions
decisions are based on the individu-
alized, holistic review of information
about each applicant that considers
academic achievements and his or her
potential to succeed, as well as many
additional variables such as essays,
letters of recommendation and other
factors.
"In the end, some student-athletes
who have received letters of intent are
not admitted and that has always been
the case."
Dorsey's father, Eddie Jackson,
that.
"Most young people who are golf-
ers or play tennis or play baseball or
play softball, sometimes even soccer,
would prefer to go someplace where
they can practice outside year-round
... So we would probably be having, in
comparison, more of apples to apples
(with Big Ten teams). It doesn't mean
that we can't compete (in the Big 12).
We can compete, but it's just more dif-
ficult."
With rumors flying that the Pac-10
Conference was looking at expanding
from its 10 teams by possibly taking up
to six Big 12 teams, the latter seemed
to be in turmoil and looked unstable.
The Big Ten had the security that
the Cornhuskers were longing for.
"Stability is something (that) when-
ever you can see it, you want to hold
onto it," Osborne said. "Because ath-
letics tends to be a very unstable pro-
fession. So we think the stability of

expressed his disappointment in an
interview with the Detroit Free Press
last week.
"Anybody would be disappointed
if you're not going to the school you
hoped," Jackson said. "He's optimistic
to go to school ... He's your son - got
to try to keep your spirits up. You live
and you learn.
"You look at it sometimes, a lot of
things coming down hard on him
through his past. Through all that he
kept a good sprit. He's a strong-head-
ed kid."
And while there continues to be
the Big Ten is something we cannot
ignore at this time."
Whether or not the Big 12's
remaining teams will stay in the con-
ference is still up in the air. And with
the departure of the University of
Colorado for the Pac-10 days before
Nebraska announced its move, the
conference is already down to 10
teams.
Osborne and Nebraska don't see
it as their fault that they might be
jumping off a ship on the verge of
sinking.
"One school leaving a confer-
ence doesn't break up a conference,"
Osborne said. "Two schools leaving a
conference doesn't break up a confer-
ence.
"Six schools leaving breaks up a
conference."
Added Nebraska chancellor Harvey
Perlman: "I (asked Big 12 presidents),
'What if Nebraska stayed and Mis-

speculation about whether other
issues affected Dorsey's situation -
the lack of communication between
the coaching staff and the Office of
Admissions or the failure of Rodri-
guez to contact the University before
offering Dorsey a scholarship, for
example - there lies one certainty:
Dorsey will not be a Michigan Wol-
verine.
Without Dorsey in defensive

souri left?' The response was that they
would stay. I said, 'What happens if
Nebraska stays and Colorado leaves,'
and the response was they would stay.
I said, 'What happens if both Missouri
and Colorado leave and Nebraska
stays?'
"And they could make no commit-
ment that they would then stay in the
Big 12."
Athletically, the changes are obvi-
ous - Nebraska provides another
team to round out the sporting sched-
ule and create new rivalries with. But
the move fits academically, too.
"The Big Ten is all members of the
(Association of American Universi-
ties), which is of considerable impor-
tance when you try and recruit faculty,
when you seek research grants, when
you do other things in the academic
environment," Perlman said. "The

see almost all of Nebraska's competi-
tive games - not just football, not just
men's basketball."
Nebraska is also a member of the
AAU.
Michigan could see the Cornhusk-
ers show up on its schedule in 2011 at
the earliest.
The two schools shared a Nation-
al Championship back in 1997 and
are among the winningest college
football programs of all time. It also
increases the Wolverines national
exposure as well.
From here, continued expansion of
the Big Ten is possible.
Many scenarios are still on the
table, with teams in the Big 12 and
Big East being linked to other confer-
ences.
But at least for now, Nebraska,
after 20 years and seven days, has
evened out the Big Ten once again -
this time at 12 teams.

Five Wolverines selected in2010 MLB Draft

By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Writer
After the 2010 Major League Base-
ball Draft last Monday-Wednesday,
one thing became clear - the Michi-
gan baseball team will face a tall task
next year.
Five Wolverines were chosen in the
MLB Draft, with three having anoth-
er year of eligibility remaining.
Junior outfielder Ryan LaMarre,
junior right-handers Matt Miller and
Tyler Burgoon, senior right-hander
Alan Oaks and senior catcher Chris
Berset went in the second, fifth,
eighth, tenth and twentieth rounds
respectively. As of this past weekend,
LaMarre, Miller and Oaks had inked
deals.
LaMarre reached terms on a con-
tract with the Cincinnati Reds, who
selected him with the 62nd overall
pick.
The junior star was out for 18 games
this year because of a broken thumb
but still managed to belt five home
runs and collect 40 RBI, leading the
team in hitting, on-base percentage
and slugging. He was named First
Team All-Big Ten for his efforts.
"This is definitely a dream,"
LaMarre said. "The Reds (are) a great
program and I'm glad to be a part of
it now.
"I feel like (Michigan coach Rich
Maloney) and myself did quite a bit of
work and that Michigan prepared me
both mentally and physically for pro-
fessional baseball."
The Jackson native reported to
the Dayton Dragons, the Reds' Low-
Single A affiliate. LaMarre's signing
officially means that he will forgo his
senior season at Michigan to begin his

professional career.
"Losing (LaMarre) in particular
is huge," Michigan coach Rich Malo-
ney said on Saturday night. "He is a
great player and has a legitimate shot
at the big leagues. It's hard to replace
a player like that. But he had a great
experience at Michigan. LaMarre has
something special. His makeup is dif-
ferent."
Miller, too, will skip his senior year.
He signed with the Milwaukee Brew-
ers, and will join the Helena Brewers
of the Rookie-ball Pioneer League,
which opens its season on June 21.
He was perhaps Michigan's most
talented pitcher, but couldn't consis-
tently perform this season. Pitching
mostly as a midweek starter, Miller
"I'm happy
for the guys,
because this is
their dream."
went 3-3 with a 5.06 ERA.
"Matt Miller is a late riser," Malo-
ney said. "A lot of times in pro base-
ball, they hope some players emerge
(later) in their career. Miller may do
that."
The Wolverine senior class also saw
success in this year's draft.
Ace pitcher Alan Oaks was picked
by the Florida Marlins. Oaks struck
out 71 batters his final year as a Wol-
verine and recorded six wins, which
tied him with Burgoon for the team

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Michigan baseball junior Ryan LaMarre has decided to forego his senior year after signing a contract with the Cincinnati Reds.

lead.
The high school hockey player
joked in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily on Saturday night about
taking advantage of his additional
year of eligibility in a different sport
and staying in Ann Arbor to play for
Red Berenson, but he said that he has
reached terms with the Marlins.
Berset followed LaMarre in the
lineup and coincidentally may also
follow him to Cincinnati. The Reds
drafted him as well and have offered
Berset a contract, which he had not yet
signed as of Saturday.
The co-captain enjoyed a breakout
senior season and was a semifinalist
for the Johnny Bench Award, named
for the former Red and given to the
best collegiate catcher in the nation.

Maloney says that despite their
amateur success, the senior pair of
Oaks and Berset have a long way to go
to make itto the big leagues.
"They have to continue to get bet-
ter," Maloney said. "If Alan pitches
like he did at Michigan, he won't make
it. For the pros, all these guys are good
players. It is so highly competitive and
it is cutthroat.
"Alan has the makings of good stuff
but it is going to have to get better. And
so will Chris."
The Seattle Mariners picked Bur-
goon, who was the Wolverines' closer.
The right-hander recorded 10 saves
this season, and was named Second
Team All-Big Ten.
Burgoon had not yet decided
whether to sign or return to school for

his senior year.
"He hasn't made a decision yet,"
Maloney said. "I think he may sign but
he hasn't told me anything. I think he
will make a decision sometime early @
next week."
Though Michigan finished second
place in the conference, the team's five
draftees were the most in the Big Ten.
It was the most for the program since
five Wolverines were also selected in
2008.
"It's great to have five players draft-
ed for our program," Maloney said.
"That means that our guys are making
some improvements and that our guys
work hard. That means people are rec-
ognizing our program.
"I'm happy for the guys, because
this is their dream."
