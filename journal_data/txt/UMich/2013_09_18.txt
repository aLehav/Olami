$301K budget is
about 12 percent less
than winter term
By DAILY WRITER
who has thisposition
Implementing an agenda on
campus doesn't come cheap.
With lower-than-expected
total student enrollment for this
academic year - 38,125 students
- to contribute to student gov-
ernment dues and about $50,000
less than expected from last
semester's carry-over, the Cen-
tral Student Government budget-
ed $301,104 for the fall semester.
The new budget is approxi-
mately 12 percent less than what
was available winter 2012.
Unlike previous semesters -
where commissions were allocat-
ed funds individually along with
the other budgeted expenses
- the 25 executive commissions
were not allocated funds for the
fall.
As per the new commission
structure implemented dur-
ing the summer by CSG Presi-
dent Michael Proppe and Vice
President Bobby Dishell, the
commissions are responsible
for compiling research-based
reports until November. The
reports include information on
the funds required during the
remainder of the year to drive

initiatives.
In the meantime, if commis-
sions require funds for their fall
initiatives, they will draw from
the $14,700 allocated to the com-
mission discretionary fund.
During the meeting, Proppe
said this structure solved the
dual purpose of allowing a great-
er allocation to the Student Orga-
nization Funding Commission
- the body primarily responsible
for funding voluntary student
organizations - and accommo-
dating the reduced budget.
Despite the new commission
structure, SOFC was allocated
about 12 percent less than what
they were given last semester. A
portion of the debate surround-
ing the budget was dedicated
to passing an amendment that
mandated that a minimum of 5
percent of the SOFC budget be
spent solely on graduate student
organizations.
On the other hand, Proppe
said it's necessary for the politi-
cal insurance to be written into
the budget, as graduate student
organizations did not face dis-
crimination when applying for
funding through SOFC along
with other undergraduate orga-
nizations.
"I don't think it is a good
idea to earmark a percent of the
SOFC budget to graduate stu-
dents," Proppe said. He added

400 Michigan Marching Band mem-
bers twinkling in time to songs made
famous by Queen Bey herself.
But that's exactly what hap-
pened when the marching band
turned down the lights at a Beyon-

Saturday's football game against the
University of Notre Dame.
The idea for the show originated
at the end of winter 2013 and the
concept developed over the summer.

new system, effective imme-
ately, in which students who
rchased full season tickets
ill have to individually claim
mes they plan to attend. He
id the move will help improve
e atmosphere at Crisler Cen-
r, which was often not filled
capacity last season because
any students attended just a
ndful of games.
"We want Crisler full," Loch-
ann said. "We want a loud
ena."
According to Lochmann,
average of 46.1% of student
'kets were used per game in

2012-13, well under the Big Ten
average of 67%. This season,
4,500 tickets were sold - an all-
time high - despite there being
just 3,000 seats allotted for
students. If seats go unclaimed
by students, they will be made
available to the general public.
Under the new system, Mich-
igan's 17 home fixtures will be
split into six different pods of
three or four games each. A cou-
ple of weeks before each pod's
contests, tickets will become
available online for a 72-hour
period. Students can then
select which games they plan to
attend, and the ticket will then
be electronically transferred to

the student's MCard where it
can be used or sold.
"The only con is not every
student is guaranteed a seat,"
Lochmann said. "But I think -
we don't know this - that if you
want to go to every game, you're
going to go to every game."
The first online claim period
will open Oct. 8, and the Wol-
verines' first home exhibition
tips off on Oct. 29.
However, if a student twice
claims tickets that he or she does
notuse, hewill notbe eligible for
tickets to the next pod of games.
If a student misses four claimed
games, he will not be eligible for

A woman reported that she was
sexually assaulted early Sunday
morning on the 300 block of May-
nard Street, accordingto the Ann
Arbor Police Department.
Between 2:15 and 2:36 a.m., a
29-year-old female was walking
to her vehicle on the 300 block
of Maynard Street when an
unknown male who had been
walking toward her exposed
himself and touched her,
according to AAPD. The woman
said she punched the suspect,
who ran toward a nearby stair-
well.
The incident is currently being
classified as fourth-degree crimi-
nal sexual conduct, which is a
misdemeanor.
In addition to providing a sur-
veillance photo, AAPD describes
the suspect as a male of unknown
race but medium complexion. The
suspect is estimated to be in his
early 20s, 5'6" to 57" in height
and 130 pounds. He has brown
straight short hair, a clean-shaven
face and brown eyes.

Georgia students lobby against textbook taxes

The University of Geor-
gia-Athens Student Gov-
ernment Association has
decided to petition the state
legislature in 2014 for a tax-
free holiday on textbooks,
The Red and Black reported.
Jon Goodfriend, the SGA
senator who authored the reso-
lution, said Georgia students
pay $70 per year in taxes on
textbooks. When accounting
for full-time students across the
state, textbook taxes amount
to $15.3 million in revenue.
StudentsinUtahrecentlycon-
vinced the state that textbook
sales served a mission of higher
education and should receive a
tax exemption similar to other
nonprofits. At UGA, university

libraries do not pay sales tax on
the acquisition of new books.
Currently, 22 states grant
some form of tax relief in text-
book sales. Georgia already
designates a tax-free week-
end for school supplies, as
well as children's books, the-
sauruses and dictionaries.
UniversityofMaryland
expands police jurisdiction to
off-campus neighborhoods
Administrators at the Univer-
sity of Maryland-College Park
announcedthatuniversitypolice
would expand their jurisdiction
to cover more off-campus areas,
The Diamondback reported.
The policy will stipulate

new zones, measuring about
a square mile, in which both
university police and local law
enforcement agencies have
enforcement powers. The uni-
versity police chief said the
department added eight offi-
cers, two squad cars and a patrol
motorcycle to better protect
areas in which students reside.
"Ours is a safe commu-
nity," University of Maryland
President Wallace Loh said.
"This initiative is to make
our community even safer."
The changes are occurring
along with an expansion of
the university's code of con-
duct to these off-campus areas.

Concurrent storms
wreak havoc on
Pacific coast area
ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)
- The death toll rose to 47
Tuesday from the unusual
one-two punch of a tropical
storm and a hurricane hitting
Mexico at nearly the same time.
Authorities scrambled to get
help into, and stranded tourists
out of, the cutoff resort city of
Acapulco.
With roads blocked by
landslides, rockslides, floods
and collapsed bridges, Acapulco
was cut off from road transport
after Tropical Storm Manuel
made landfall on Sunday.
The terminal at the city's
international was flooded, but
not the landing strips.
Commercial carriers and the
Mexican military responded
by setting up flights ferrying
tourists to a nearby concert
hall instead of the terminal.
Emergency flights began
arriving in Acapulco to evacuate
at least 40,000 mainly Mexican
tourists stranded in the resort
city where some streets were
transformed into raging brown
rivers.
Interior Secretary Miguel
Angel Osorio Chong told the
Radio Formula that 27 people
had died because of the storm
in the Pacific coast state of
Guerrero, where Acapulco is
located. Osorio Chong said 20
more people died nationwide,
many as a result of former
hurricane Ingrid, which struck
the Gulf coast on Monday.
Mexican meteorologists said
it was the first time since 1958
that two tropical storms or
hurricanes had hit both the
country's coasts within 24
hours.
While most Acapulco
hotels seemed to be operating
normally on Tuesday, many
outlying neighborhoods were
without water or electricity, and

floodwaters were knee-deep
at the city airport's check-in
counters.
Federal officials said it could
take at least another day to open
the main highway to Acapulco,
which was hit by more than 13
landslides from surrounding
hills, and to bring food and relief
supplies into the city of more
than 800,000 people.
Two of Mexico's largest
airlines, Aeromexico and
Interjet, began running flights
to and from the still-swamped
international airport.
Those with tickets got first
priority,thenfamilies withsmall
children or elderly members,
officials said. Interjet's director
Luis Jose Garza told Milenio TV
that his airline's first flightwas
taking 150 passengers back to
Mexico City and it hoped to run
four to six such flights Tuesday.
The Guerrero state
governmentsaid 40,000tourists
were stuck in the city, while the
head of the local chamber of
business owners said reports
from hotels indicated the
number could be as high as
60,000.
Many tourists finally
emerged from their hotels
Tuesday morning after days of
peltingrain.
"We realized the extent of
the disaster for the first time
because we were closed in and
only saw rain and flooding," said
Alejandra Vadillo Martinez, a
24-year-old from Mexico City
staying with seven relatives
in the Crowne Plaza Hotel
overlooking Acapulco's bay.
The main coastal boulevard
was open Tuesday and most
hotels appeared to have power,
water and food. But that was
little consolation to those unable
to leave.
"We've realized that it was
a mistake to come to Acapulco
because all we saw was rain,
rain, rain," said Guadalupe
Hernandez, a 55-year-old
housewife from the Mexican
capital.

The situation was far more
serious in the city's low-
income periphery, where steep
hills funneled rainwater into
neighborhoods of cinderblock
houses.
City officials said about
23,000 homes, mostly on
Acapulco's outskirts, were
without electricity and water.
Stores were nearly emptied by
residents who rushed to stockup
on basic goods. Landslides and
flooding damaged an unknown
number of homes.
Natividad Gallegos said
she returned Monday from
shopping to find her house in a
poor Acapulco neighborhood
buried by a landslide that killed
six members of her family,
including her two children. "I
saw a lot of strangers with picks
and shovels, digging where
my house used to be," she said,
weeping.
The coastal town of Coyuca
de Benitez and beach resorts
further west of Acapulco,
including Ixtapa and
Zihuatenejo, were cut off after a
river washed out a bridge on the
main coastal highway.
Marcela Higuera, who runs a
breadstallintheCoyucamarket,
said the only aid thathad arrived
so far was a helicopter that
rescued stranded flood victims.
"Flour's already run out.
There isn't any in Coyuca,"
she said, adding that the
Coyuca River had swept
away the bridge and riverside
restaurants, and flooded low-
lying neighborhoods. "This is
the worst storm that I've seen."
"There are hundreds of
people in shelters and they're
begging for clothes and blankets
because everything they have is
wet," Higuera said. "They had to
leave without taking anything."
Remnants of Manuel
continued to drench Mexico
further up the Pacific coast and
the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said it could regain force
near resorts at the tip of the Baja
California Peninsula.

Asian carp found
in water near
Lake Michigan
The recent discovery of a large
Asian carp near Chicago under-
scores the need to protect the
Great Lakes from the voracious
fish and other invasive species
that could slip into Lake Michi-
gan, two members of Congress
said Tuesday.
"If Asian carp are not stopped
before they enter the Great Lakes,
they could destroy the ecosystem,
as well as the boating and fishing
industries, and hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs," said Sen. Debbie
Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat.
The director of the White
House Council on Environmen-
tal Quality's Asian carp program
reported the find last week dur-
ing a Great Lakes conference in
Milwaukee that drew hundreds
of environmental advocates, sci-
entists and government officials
from across the eight-state region
and Canada.

$30 million fund
issued to redevelop
Woodward Avenue
A $30 million fund has been
launched to promote physical
redevelopment along Detroit's
Woodward Corridor.
The Kresge Foundation and
NCB Capital Impact say the
money will be used for real estate
projects that promote density
and diversity in the city's core.
The project is being
announced 2 months after state-
appointed emergency manager
Kevyn Orr made Detroit the
largest city in the U.S. to file for
bankruptcy.
The fund will provide long-
term fixed rate loans to let devel-
opers start construction more
quickly.
Kresge President Rip Rapson
says the Woodward Corridor
InvWstment Fund is an example
of one of the tools needed to sup-
port revitalization in Detroit.

Colorado flooding
could keep tourists
away
A little more than a year after
Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper
insisted his wildfire-ravaged state
was still "open for business," he
mayhave to throw another lifeline
to the state's billion-dollar tourism
industry as the world takes in the
startling images of dramatic flood
rescues and washed-out roads.
The flooding has struck at the
very mountains that give the
state its identity and attract mil-
lions of hikers, campers and ski-
ers. Months and possibly years of
painstaking, expensive repairs lie

ahead, but Colorado officials must
also deal with a second problem-
the risk that catastrophic damage
could keep tourists away, even
from places that are unharmed.

Lochmann said.
Lochmann added that the
system has worked well in other
schools, including at Kansas.
Entry to Crisler Center on
gamedays will commence as in

previous years; those who arrive
earliest will earn bleacher seats.
For the Wolverines' marquee
contest against rival Michigan
State, the Athletic Department
will distribute its allotment of
3,000 tickets to the students who
attended the most games.
"(The Michigan State game) is
where we're going to reward our
most loyal students," Lochmann
said.

Lochmann said demand for
student tickets is at its highest
point since the Fab Five era in
the early 1990s. The new system
allows for the Athletic Depart-
ment to grant full season tickets
to every student who request-
ed them while avoiding a split

further debated the distribution
of money between the executive
and legislative discretionary
funds. The budget proposed that
the executive fund be allocated
$2,000 more than the legislative
fund; representatives, however,
debated over this margin.
Despite the reduced total
budget, the legislative fund was
allocated $2,500 more than
what was the previous semester

and the executive fund would
be given $4,500 more than last
semester.
LSA senior Pratik Ghosh said
he believed the assembly's work
warranted additional legislative
funds.
"While the (greater legisla-
tive discretionary funding) is
unprecedented, I think this
assembly is unprecedented,"
Ghosh said during the meeting.
"We're going to get a lot done."
In addition, the committee
unanimously approved a reso-

responsibility of allocating a

music. While some of the con-
tent for halftime shows, such as
scripting, is student-generated.
Just like University athletes,
marching band members return
to campus early to prepare for
the fall sports season.
Information graduate student
Kayla MacLennan, currently a
staff assistant for the march-
ing band, performed with the
band during her four years as
an undergraduate student at the
University. She said the band
begins intense practices about
two-and-a-half weeks before
classes begin, often drilling from
about 9a.m. until 10 p.m.
"Our style is different than
anywhere else, so everyone kind
of has to start from scratch,
and then we get time to start
(practicing for) our first show,"
MacLennan said.
There's also a weekly "chal-
lenge process" during the school
year to decide which members
will actually perform for which
games. Out of 405 members, only
235 perform in the pregame and
280 perform at half time.
The chosen members are noti-

this monumental task," which
includes developing a pool of
candidates, conducting inter-
views and recommending candi-
dates to the board
The firm and the seven fac-
ulty members serve as the
Presidential Search Advisory
Committee to the Board of
Regents, who alone serve as the
Presidential Search Committee.
Ultimately, the final choice for
the next president will be left up
to the board.
Unlike past years, the advi-
sory committee doesn't include
a student representative. Under
the State of Michigan Constitu-
tion, the regents "shall, as often
as necessary, elect a president of
the institution under its super-
vision," meaning the board has
"the sole authority and respon-
sibility" to elect the president,
according to White.
Out of the top 25 U.S. public
universities, the University of
Michigan and Clemson Univer-
sity are the only institutions that
didn't include students on their
most recent presidential search
committees. The College of Wil-
liam and Mary did not have a for-
mal committee beyond its Board
of Visitors in its most recent
search.
Instead of allowing students
on the actual search committee,
the regents and their advisers
announced the dates of public
forums that will allow students,
faculty, alumni, staff and the
general public to weigh in on the
presidential search. The forums
will be question-and-answer
based, and will survey attendees
on the qualities they desire in the
next University president.
White wrote that the forums
will allow the committee to

gather "different perspectives"
on important qualities necessary
in the next president. The com-
mittee will take the information
into account when making rec-
ommendations to the board to
select the new president.
To develop a diverse selection
ofcandidates, theboardwill con-
sider contenders nominated by

fled on a Friday, and rehearse the
following Monday through Fri-
day for an hour and a half each
day. The band never repeats the
same show at home, giving them
a lot of shows to learn and little
time to learn them.
For Engineering junior Ruiqi
Chen, rehearsals during the
school year that led up to the
Beyonce show weren't always
enough. He described the cycle
of practicing and performing
for the shows like studying for
a test.
"If you don't do your home-
work, you're not going to do well
on the exam, and the exam is the
halftime show," Chen said.
For Chen, who said he tends
to have problems when it comes
to dance moves, the dance break
in the middle of the Beyonc6
performance was particularly
challenging. The increased par-
ticipation of the dance team this
year has led to the creation of
more complicated dances per-
formed at halftime.
Yet another elaborate - and in
some ways perplexing - aspect
of the Beyonc6 show was the use
of lasers.
Spectators may have noticed
a larger-than-life figure swaying
to the music along with the band.
That image was actually cre-

received at the search commit-
tee's e-mail address, umich.
president@russellreynolds.com,
to which the public can submit
recommendations.
White could not give many
details on the search process
itself, since the process is still
underway and its details are pri-
vate.
However, University alum
Matt Nolan - former Michi-
gan Student Assembly president
and member of the 2001 search
committee that chose Coleman
- said the committee he par-
ticipated on spoke with former
University presidents as well as
the current president at the time,
Lee Bollinger, who now serves as
the president of Columbia Uni-
versity.
The 2001 group - which also
included University alum Lisa
Jackson, current regents White,
Laurence Deitch (D-Bloomfield
Hills) and Andrew Fischer New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) and Athletic
Director Dave Brandon, a former
regent - fielded through many
resumes and CVs, eventually
narrowing down candidates and
conducting interviews.
Nolan said he felt fortunate to
participate on the board, espe-
cially since he heard from Cole-
man before she was hired on why
she deserved to be the University
president.
"Hearing in her words sort of
why she would want to leave the
position she was in to become
president of the University of
Michigan, to me, underscored
my appreciation for how special
of a place Michigan is and just
how really unique it is not just
in the state, not just in the coun-
try, but in the world it can bring
together," Nolan said.
Nolan and Jackson served as
student representatives for the
group - a role missing in the

current committee. Nolan said
he felt his presence allowed the
group to remind the committee
of the importance of students
and to take that point into con-
sideration during the search pro-
cess.
However, times have changed.
With the advent of social media,
Nolan said, a student representa-

ated by pre-recording a member
of the dance team, making her
movements into a silhouette and
then outlining her figure in laser
beams to be projected during the
show.
MacLennan said while the
band directors always want
members in perfect formation,
the added element of laser beams
shooting from the press box
made staying in formation an
even greater necessity.
"We had to be really careful,"
she said.
Chen said performing in the
dark was a peculiar experience
compared to previous shows.
"It was a little bit scary when
I couldn't see where I was going.
We never fully rehearsed with
the lights off," he said.
Last Saturday's performance
marked the first time the stadi-
um lights were ever turned off at
a football game halftime show at
Michigan Stadium
MacLennan cited the support
of the Athletic Department and
talent of marching band mem-
bers for the success of the show.
"Dave Brandon is extremely
supportive of the band," she said.
"We wouldn't be able to do the
cool things that we do without
that (support) ... or even get those
really cool blinky bracelets. It's
tive on the committee runs the
risk of breaching privacy and
possibly leaking secretive infor-
mation.
However, students plan to
take the input that they do have
with great stride. The University
Council established a student
committee that will gather stu-
dent opinions on the qualities
desired in the next president
through a five-question survey to
be e-mailed to the student body.
The compiled feedback from
that committee will be presented
at the public forum on Sept. 26.
Since the group is recognized by
the regents, White said the com-
mittee is "crucial" in aiding the
process.
One year ago, the University
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
- another large, public research
university - underwent and
completed a chancellor search
with a 21-member committee
that held four public forums that
were similar to the University's
upcoming meetings. The com-
mittee included members of the
school's Board of Trustees, stu-
dents, faculty, staff, alumni and
community members.
The UNC committee selected
R. William Funk & Associates to
help the search process for a price
of $120,000, excluding addition-
al travel and general expenses. It
also set up an e-mail address to
which the public could send their
opinions and nominations.
Although the committee met
privately, they published their
meeting location, dates and some
of the minutes for the public to
see. The committee held a total of
19 meetings, including the public
forums, between Nov. 2012 and
March 2013. The chosen chan-
cellor, Carol Folt, who served as
interim president at Dartmouth
College before former University
Provost Phil Hanlon took office,
was appointed in April.

However, as the committee-
sponsored public forums began
Tuesday, the decision on who the
next president of the University
will be inches closer and closer
with each opinion offered.

Search committee
holds public forum
on med. campus

Speakers seek pres.
with experience in
health care
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily Sports Editor
The first set of six public=
forums on the search for the
next University president con-
vened Tuesday on the Medical
Center Campus and at the Uni-
versity's Flint Campus.
Regent Katherine White (D)
led the discussion Tuesday eve-
ning, along with Alison Ranney,
a consultant with the firm hired
to conduct the seaarch, Russell-
Reynolds Associates.
Three faculty members of the
Presidential Search Committee
and four additional regents-
Julia Darlow (D), Mark Ber-
nstein (D) and Shauna Ryder
Diggs (D) - jotted notes and
asked follow-up questions to
about 25 students, faculty and
community members gathered
in the Taubman Biomedical Sci-
ence Research Building's audito-
rium.
After briefly explaining the
search process, White and Ran-
ney asked the crowd of mostly
faculty and medical students to
consider the challenges the Uni-
versity will face over the next
one, five or twenty years as well
as qualities they would want the
committee to keep in mind when
choosing a candidate.
While a few periods of
silence occurred in the mostly
unfilled auditorium, a steady
flow of comments generally
characterized the forum. Com-
ments centered on a wide array
of issues and challenges. Some
were focused on the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health Sys-
tem, with multiple speakers
expressing the importance of
a candidate with a background

at an institution with a hos-
pital. Two other contributors
also expressed the importance
of facing the challenges of the
changing landscape of health-
care, following passage of the
Affordable Care Act.
More generally, multiple med-
ical school students addressed
college affordability, touching
on topics such as scholarships
and tuition costs, as well as the
need to attract students from
diverse backgrounds in terms
of race and socio-economic sta-
tus. Other comments addressed
alumni engagement and build-
ing cohesion and partnership
between University of Michigan
units and campuses, in Flint and
Dearborn.
Peter Farrehi, an assistant
professor in the department of
internal medicine, pointed out
that the next University presi-
dent effect not just the campus
in Ann Arbor, but the entire state
of Michigan, including cities like
Flint and Dearborn.
"The state is in dire need of
the University's leadership," he
said.
Farrehi mentioned that
many people are interested in
becoming more global, but the
University and its next presi-
dent must place greater empha-
sis on supporting the local
community.
Multiple commenters men-
tioned community-oriented
needs as challenges that are just
as important as the University's
global expansion, both in the
scope of the hospital and the
University at large.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
White said many of these con-
cerns were also echoed earlier
in the day at a forum on the Flint
campus.
The next public forums will
occur on Thursday, Sept. 26 and
Friday, Sept. 28.

Brazil to depart from
U.S. -centric Internet

Nation increases net
independence, cites
concerns with NSA
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -
Brazil plans to divorce itself
from the U.S.-centric Internet
over Washington's widespread
online spying, a move that many
experts fear will be a potential-
ly dangerous first step toward
fracturing aglobal network built
with minimal interference by
governments.
President Dilma Rousseff
ordered a series of measures
aimed at greater Brazilian
online independence and secu-
rity following revelations that
the U.S. National Security
Agency intercepted her commu-
nications, hacked into the state-
owned Petrobras oil company's
network and spied on Brazilians
who entrusted their personal
data to U.S. tech companies such
as Facebook and Google.
The leader is so angered by
the espionage that on Tuesday
she postponed next month's
scheduled trip to Washington,
where she was to be honored
with a state dinner.

Internet security and policy
experts say the Brazilian gov-
ernment's reaction to infor-
mation leaked by former NSA
contractor Edward Snowden
is understandable, but warn
it could set the Internet on a
course of Balkanization.
"The global backlash is only
beginning and will get far more
severe in coming months," said
Sascha Meinrath, director of
the Open Technology Institute
at the Washington-based New
America Foundation think tank.
"This notion of national privacy
sovereignty is going to be an
increasinglysalientissue around
the globe."
While Brazil isn't proposing
to bar its citizens from U.S.-
based Web services, it wants
their data to be stored locally
as the nation assumes greater
control over Brazilians' Internet
use to protect them from NSA
snooping.
The danger of mandating
that kind of geographic isola-
tion, Meinrath said, is that it
could render inoperable popu-
lar software applications and
services and endanger the
Internet's open, interconnected
structure.

Success with social bonds?
Michigan should be cautious with this program
his month, Michigan became the eighth state chosen to receive
aid from the Social Impact Bond Technical Assistance Lab at
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
The crux of this social impact bond model is that private investors team
up with state governments to create and finance social-service programs.
The bonds, also known as pay-for-success contracts, allow governments
to explore solutions to persistent social problems while saving taxpayer
dollars. In light of recent budget cuts made by the states GOP leadership
and legislature, the advent of this program comes with good timing. How-
ever, because of the lack of sufficient empirical evidence on the success of
the program, the state must proceed with caution.

SIB Lab's venture into social-impact bonds
is the largest in the United States to date. The
bonds provide states with money for programs
that were previously underfunded to tackle
pressing issues such as recidivism, lack of early-
childhood education, homelessness and more.
If the programs succeed, taxpayers pay the
investors back with a profit. Bonuses are also
awarded if programs exceed target levels. If the
programs do not succeed, however, taxpayers
incur no cost, and investors receive no returns.
What makes the bonds worthwhile is that
through pay-for-success contracts, states are
able to reap the benefits of these programs with
little risk up front. The contracts encourage
private investment and also allow state gov-
ernments to reallocate existing funds to other
underfunded matters. Additionally, fellows
from the SIB Lab monitor the programs, elimi-
nating the possibility of investor corruption
and an expensive bill for the government and
taxpayers, as was the case when school admin-
istrators fabricated test scores to receive money
from the No Child Left Behind program.
The chief complaint against social-impact
bonds is that they lack performance data.

Although considerable success has been seen
in Britain and Australia, it's difficult to tell if
the program will thrive in the United States.
New York and several other states have only
just begun the program. That being said, it's
imperative that the state of Michigan takes
all risks into consideration and is as transpar-
ent as possible throughout the process. More-
over, the state should play a significant role
in the search for investors in order to provide
greater oversight.
The recent balancing of the state's budget
has severely curtailed funds for critical social
programs, such as the Michigan Prisoner
Reentry Initiative. Social-impact bonds have
the potential to ease these blows and increase
the amount of money flowing into our econ-
omy without crippling our tax base. Snyder
describes Michigan as "the nation's Come-
back State," but if the state wants to make a
significant economic recovery, it should not
do it by taking this program at face value and
gambling on people's livelihoods. The state
legislature certainly welcomes this program
as it applied to be a part of it, but it should
embrace it carefully.

Miss-represention

"How the fuck does a foreigner win Miss
America?" they said. "Miss New York is an
Indian ... With all do respect, this is America."
In the shadow of Nina Davuluri's historic
win at the Miss America pageant, her fellow
Americans flocked to Twitter to voice their
patriotism. "So Miss America is a terrorist,"
they cried.
Davuluri's crowning on Sunday marks the
first time an Indian-American has won the
prestigious scholarship pageant - a day to be
celebrated as America trends toward a collec-
tive tolerance, and yet the moment is marred
by prejudice and ignorance. Born in Syracuse,
N.Y., Davuluri legally deserves the second
half of her descriptor - Indian-American. She
attended the University of Michigan, earning a
degree in brain behavior and cognitive science,
and plans to pay back her debt to U.S. society
by applying to medical school. For some Ameri-
cans, however, this isn't enough.
"WHEN WILL A WHITE WOMAN WIN
#MISSAMERICA? Ever??!!" they protest.
While the racist remarks directed towards
Davuluri are certainly not a sentiment shared
by the majority, I know it's a dialogue that all
minorities in America have heard before. I,
like our new Miss America, don't look like the
prototypical American - but you already knew
that. Wang might be equivalent to Smith in
China, but here it's a dead giveaway. Despite

being born in Michigan, I look like I was born
in Hong Kong. And because of these differenc-
es, I am occasionally invited by other Ameri-
cans to go back to my own country. Usually,
they address me as a "chink" - rude. But, it's
not just me. Minorities all across the country
have experienced something similar to varying
degrees. I want to be American, yet sometimes
I can't help but feel that America doesn't want
minorities like me. Davuluri was born in New
York, but she looks like she was born in Mum-
bai, leadingsome to say, "If you're #MissAmeri-
ca you should have to be American."
I know that most Americans are not so big-
oted, and that the general consensus is that
diversity is something to be celebrated. I know
the United States is one of the only nations on
earth that has to balance so many different
people. And I know that, for the most part, we
are doing a good job of coexisting together. But
it's insulting to suggest that we are a post-racial
America. And it is insulting to hear other Amer-
icans bemoan the efforts of expanding diversity
and compassion as excessive and unnecessary.
When the first American of Indian descent is
crowned Miss America and a group of Ameri-
cans respond with, "Asian or indian are you kid-
din this is america omg," I know we've still got
work to do.

After the acoustic album

the band continued with their

playing songs from their most
recent effort, Daisy, as well as
those from The Devil And God

cert lacked any songs from Your
Favorite Weapon, which marked
the band's debut in 2000. This
is understandable as the band's
extensive catalog of songs allow
them some separation from their
less-developed first album. Less
understandable, however, was
the noticeable absence of the
songs "Jesus Christ" and "Sow-

most popular songs.
The set's closer, "Luca," con-
veyed the overall feeling of the
entire performance with many
standing in subdued apprecia-
tion during the slow, stripped-
down sections before going
wild and screaming along to
the song's climactic explosions.
After the conclusion of the set,
many fans were left waiting for
an encore that might have con-
tained one or two of the still-
unplayed hits, and their chants
of "one more song" were left
unanswered as the lights went
up and the crew began putting
away the equipment.
This lack of closure seemed
like a slight snub to the fans
for whom Lacey professed his
appreciation for earlier in the
set - even more disappointing
compared to the transcendental
nature of the performance. Alas,
all things must come to an end,
and even without the encore
most fans were left with the sat-
isfaction of finally being able to
see the iconic band perform live
while they still had the chance.

Travel to Lovecraft Country

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
DailyArts Writer
My interest in H.P. Lovecraft
began while reading the thoughts
of another master of horror, Ste-
phen King. King's statement that
Lovecraft was the impetus for
his literary life in horror caught
my attention. Acting as the single
greatest influence on a man who
wrote such chilling pieces as "The
Man in the Black Suit" and "Suf-
fer the Little Children," I was
impressed and intrigued.
Then suddenly, Lovecraft
began to pop up more and more.
I quickly decided I needed to see
what all the fuss was about and
planned to read one of his works.
However, the sheer number of
stories, coupled with the fact that
I found the short-story format
an awkward fit to my schedule,
meant that I kept pushing it off.
Enter mysummer job. Sittingin
a small, isolated booth for upward
of two hours a day, I found the
length, and atmosphere, of Love-
craft's stories a perfect fit. With
high temperatures and some
unreasonably angry patrons, it's
no wonder I turned to tales of ter-
ror and madness.
I discovered a very devoted fan
base, covering everything from
RPGs to theoretical postulates on
the Cthulu mythos. Indeed, I'm
still very much a newbie to the
cult of Lovecraft. But even so, I'm
here to initiate you.

Jacques Greene's
remix strips down
the original song
By ERIKA HARWOOD
Daily Arts Writer
I'll admit: I'm slightly (and
sadly) prejudiced toward remix-
es of songs I adore. I speak from
past listening experiences when
I say that shoving unnecessary
dance beats or a dubstep-style
drop on a flawless original is
essentially akin to taking a dump
on a Picasso. Anyone armed with
a laptop with a half-full battery
can take a song and embellish it
with technological nonsense, but
Jacques Greene's veteran touch
makes
his remix First seen on
of Autre -the filter
Ne Veut's

"Play By Play" stand out as so
refreshing.
For the past few months ANV's
"Play By Play" has been my go-to
song. Despite a play count in the
triple digits, I still listento it mul-
tiple times every day - likea psy-
cho - and have yetto get sick of it.
Filled with layers upon layers of
Arthur Ashin's R&B-style croon-
ing on top of dazzling electronic
sounds, every listen provides a
new experience. Unarguably, the
song overwhelms, but in the most
euphoric and transcendent way
imaginable.
Then I saw this tweet by
Ashin: "I'm not sure that it can be
overstated that @jacquesgreene
made a remix of Play By Play."
I cried a little. Is nothing
sacred anymore? Is it possible for
music lovers to have one beloved
song go untainted by some
bearded Brookyln-ite's shitty
keyboard?

Apparently so, because this
remix isn't terrible. It's actually
pretty damn good. And to top it
off, Greene's beardless - so as far
as the glass ceiling of DJs go, he
seems to be making an attempt
to shatter all barriers. Instead
of distorting and misusing the
original (the ultimate crime of
awful remixes), Greene's version
strips it down, crafting a distinct,
alternate vision of Ashin's track.
The muffled beats build slowly
during the course of the song's
nearly seven minutes and keep
you clutching to Greene's every
sound and Ashin's every word.
Don't get me wrong, the origi-
nal will always reign superior
in my eyes, but as perfectly exe-
cuted remixes go, Greene knows
how to kill it.

fully available NOTEBOOK
to play against
Connecticut, three weeks after
undergoing arthoscopic knee sur-
gery.
Avery dressed against Notre
Dame but was only available in a
supporting special teams role. He
didn't play against Akron.
"Some programs might've
thrown him in a lot in these last
two weeks when they cleared
him, but we're not going to do
that," Mattisonsaid. "We'regoing
to make sure a guy is healthy, 100
percent. I know he's really anx-
ious to get going, and we're anx-
ious for him to be in there also."
But as excited as Mattison is
at the prospect of Avery's return,
one looming question remains:
where does he even fit in with the
rest of the secondary?
The problem lies within the
Wolverines who have filled in
since Avery's absence - Mat-
tison cited sophomore Jarrod
Wilson and fifth-year senior
Thomas Gordon as players who
have stepped up to the two safety
positions.One position that Avery
certainly won't play, though, is
the nickel.
"(Redshirt sophomore) Blake
(Countess) has done a real good
job for us there, so we'll keep
him there and the next corner up
would go at the corner," Mattison
said.
Countess has three intercep-
tions in two games.

INSTANT MEALS: In what way
did the Wolverines treat their
game against Akron like a micro-
wave?
According to offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges, the Wolver-
ines seemed to expect the same
instant gratification when playing
the Zips as they do when cooking
afrozen meal - thatatouchdown
or a sack would come as easily as
pushing a button.
"The big thing about a game
like that, because you're playing
a team that you're heavily favored
(against), there's a natural ten-
dency for everyone to think every
time you get the ball you should
score (and) every time they get it,
they should be stopped," Borges
said. "If that doesn't happen,
everyone starts freaking out....
These are the types of things that
are a perfect storm for the team to
upset you."
Borges didn't anticipate hav-
ing to keep on-field frenzies to
a minimum against Akron. He
also didn't expect having to do so
much coaching and re-coaching
during the game either. After
watching the Wolverines strug-
gle play after play, it was clear to
Borges his message wasn't getting
through to his offense.
"How many times am I telling
you the same thing time and time
again, and you're just not getting
it?" he asked. "It's a different deal
when you're playing on Main
Street than when you're playing
on State Street.
"A great coach demands what
he wants, he doesn't suggest it."
CABLE, ZERO, TRAIN: Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke said he
knew what the final defensive
play call that would save the Wol-
verines from Akron was going to

By JEFF GARLAND
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's golf team
opened the season Monday with
a third-place finish in the Wol-
verine Intercollegiate at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Golf Course
behind standout Chris O'Neill.
The sophomore posted an
impressive five-under-par 66 in
his final round Tuesday, which
brought his tournament total to
seven-under par, good enough for
an individual runner-up finish.
Despite the low score, he
didn't necessarily play his best
golf Tuesday. He managed to
make putts when he needed to,
though, which was a point of
emphasis for him this offseason.
"My putting has gotten signifi-
cantly better since last season,"
O'Neill said.
After a tee shot deep into the
trees, a lateral punch-out to the
edge ofthe fairway and astraight-
forward approach onto the 15th
green, the sophomore drilled a
10-footer into the back of the cup
to save par. O'Neill pumped his
fist as the ball rolled in.
O'Neill's best shot of the day
came following a wayward tee
shot on the par-3 12th hole that
left his ball in a nasty green-side
bunker.
"There was a big slope," O'Neill
said. "I was able to land it on top
of the slope with a bunch of spin,
and it was able to check and then
release down the slope. I just got
lucky enough to have it on exactly
the right line for it to go in."
O'Neill's performance was
complemented by sophomore
lefty Brett McIntosh. He shot a
one-under 212 for the tourna-
ment - good enough for a share
of sixth place individually out of
a field of 60.
Collectively, the team finished
four over par for the two-day,
54-hole tournament, five strokes
behind the winner, Michigan
State. Lamar finished second

with a score of one-over par.
This tournament marks the
only time the team will play at its
home course all year.
The last time the Wolverines
played competitively as a team
was the 2012-13 Big Ten Champi-
onships in April, when Michigan
placed 10th out of 12.
Despite the result, expecta-
tions are high for this year's
team.
"We've got to compete at a
high level, and we've got to com-
pete to win tournaments," said
Michigan coach Chris Whitten.
"That's our expectation."
With a roster composed of
three freshmen, three sopho-
mores and one junior, this year's
group lacks the senior leadership
of last year's, but the current col-
lection of talent is very exciting
for the third-year coach.
"This group is going to be
together for a long time," Whit-
ten said. "The thing about them
that stands out is the chemistry
they have with each other, and
we'll get better because of that."
O'Neill is the team's undis-
puted leader, both on and off the
course. He is the team's return-
ing leader in scoring average,
having posted a 73.96 mark per
round last year.
"I'm only a sophomore, but I
did it last year," O'Neill said. "It's
hard, especially for the freshmen
coming in, so I'm just trying to
show these guys how it's done."
For the Wolverines, finish-
ing in the top three of any event
is always a team goal. In that
respect, this was a successful
tournament for Michigan.
"We were in it with a chance to
win with nine holes to go," Whit-
ten said.
But the Wolverines were
unable to come from behind and
win at the end. Going forward,
look for this team to play more
aggressively down the stretch to
put it in position to win tourna-
ments.

Senior defensive back Courtney Avery has played limited minutes recently.

be before Mattison even called it.
The play - "cable zero train" -
was a full-on blitz, with complete
man-to-man coverage from the
cornerbacks and no help from the
safeties.
"Everybody has a responsibil-
ity. Everybody has a gap. Every-
body has to execute that defense
perfectly, and they did," Mattison
said. "In that defense, if you take
a false step, you're a second late."
And no one executed better
than junior linebacker Brennen
Beyer, whose hit on Akron quar-

terback Kyle Pohl preserved the
Wolverines' perfect record.
And apparently, all it takes to
pull off that type of play is being a
"Michigan man," at least accord-
ing to Mattison.
"He just does what he's
coached to do every time," Mat-
tison said. "When he doesn't, he
will tell you before he doesn't.
That's what we want in a Michi-
gan defensive player, and that's
what he's responded to do week
in and week out, play in and play
out."

Pass rush a chief concern

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
It's been nearly11months since
the Michigan men's soccer team
has earned a regular-season vic-
tory on the road.
Tuesday night, the Fighting
Irish shut down the Wolverines,
3-0, in South Bend, Ind., making
that stretch _
of time a MICHIGAN 0
little longer NOTRE DAME 3
and a little
more painful for the team, its
fans and Michigan coach Chaka
Daley.
After posting a 1-5 road mark
last season, the team is hungry
for wins in enemy territory, and it
showed on the field against Notre
Dame. But so did its inability to
capitalize on offensive chances.
The Wolverines racked up 13
fouls in the first half alone, and
freshman defenseman Andre
Morris was issued a yellow card
in the 43rd minute, the first of
three cautions for the team on
the night. The Wolverines tacked
on anther 0 oulsin +he secnd

Brett Nason and senior defen-
seman Ezekiel Harris were the
Michigan players tagged with
yellow cards.
While it was the Wolverines
(1-2-2) that had the game's first
scoring chances off shots from
sophomore forward James Mur-
phy and junior midfielder Marcos
Ugarte, Notre Dame (3-0-2) was
able to capitalize early on when
senior forward Harrison Shipp
tucked the ball behind Grinwis
and into the left corner of the goal
in the third minute.
Notre Dame scored again in
the 24th minute off a header from
sophomore midfielder Evan Pan-
ken, and its final marker came in
the 81st minute off a breakaway
goal that slid in the lower-right
side of the goal.
Each team posted seven shots
in the first half, yet Michigan
couldn't put the ball past senior
goalie Patrick Wall. Murphy and
senior forward Fabio Pereira, two
of Michigan's top scorers, contin-
uously missed outside the box or
gave the ball right back to Notre
Dame.

defense after the break, unable
to move the ball up the field until
a good 20 minutes in. The Fight-
ing Irish maintained possession
for the majority of the half, not
allowing the Wolverines to even
get a second-half shot off until
the 67th minute. Michigan had
only five shots in total in the sec-
ond half to Notre Dame's 12.
While Grinwis allowed three
goals, he also came up with five
saves, tied for his season high.
Co-captain and redshirt junior
midfielder Tyler Arnone gave the
Wolverines their best chance for
a goal in the 79th minute, beating
two defenders from 19 yards out
before firing a left-footed blast
that was deflected out of bounds
by Wall for a corner kick, one of
six Michigan earned on the eve-
ning.
The loss was a tough pill to
swallow for a team that is so
badly in need of road wins, and it
served as a reminder that it will
take more than an aggressive on-
field presence to win games.
Note: Michigan coach Chaka
Daley refused to comment after the

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEdior
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison anticipated the ques-
tion almost immediately after sit-
ting down for his Tuesday press
conference.
"I might as well answer it
before you ask," Mattison said.
"What about the pass rush?"
Mattison feels that it's him,
not his defensive front, that
has the most to answer to after
another lackluster effort of pres-
suring the opposing quarterback
in Saturday's narrow win over
Akron.
He also expressed surprise
that all ofthe teams Michigan has
faced so far have opted to go into
max protection. Senior defensive
tackle Jibreel Black noted that
teams are quickly picking up on
 the increased emphasis placed on
the pass rush in camp.
"We've got a lot of athletes on.
our defensive line," Black said.
"We've really got to focus, tune
in and get past that max protec-
tion."
According to Mattison, teams
are choosing to turn games
against the Wolverines into
possession battles, challenging
Michigan to either send more
men to pressure the QB or sit

back and get shredded apart. So
far the Wolverines have opted for
the latter option, getting torched
for 346 yards per game through
the air.
Still, Mattison acknowledged
that all the criticism of the defen-
sive woes shouldn't fall on the
pas rush. After all, it's only three
games into the season and some
leeway is warranted for each
defensive lineman to figure how
to fulfill his role.
The secret to an effective pass
rush is success in individual
matchups. That has eluded Mich-
igan to this point, and according
to Mattison, it will continue to
until the defensive front masters
moves it should be grasping.
The Wolverines defense was
held without a sack against the
Zips and has collected just five
sacks through three weeks.
"I don't think we're over-
whelmed," Black said. "We didn't
digest the information as well as
we could've so that's why we're
goingback to the drawingboard."
Black also said that it would
be unfair to judge the line exclu-
sively by its sack totals, though he
did say, "The numbers don't lie."
According to Black, this week in
practice has marked a return to
fundamentals for the unit.
The Wolverines will con-

tinue to rotate speedier bodies
into obvious passing situations,
because they lack the move-
ment that players like 301-pound
fifth-year senior defensive tackle
Quinton Washington and 315-
pound sophomore defensive
tackle Ondre Pipkins have from
the outside.
As the unit continues to search
for solutions going forward, Black
said he wouldn't take it personal-
ly should Mattison decide to dial
up more blitz's.
"We want to do what's best for
the team," Black said. "If it's best
for the team to blitz certain quar-
terbacks, that's what we're going
to do."
Whether sending more than
four rushers will solve Michi-
gan's pass rush problems remains
to be seen. But a change is needed
before the lack of pressure shows
up as an 'L'. After all, a goal-line
stand with an all-out blitz on the
last play of the game is all that
kept Michigan from a devastat-
ing loss to Akron.
"I told them on Sunday, it's
not acceptable how we're pass
rushing," Mattison said. "Appar-
ently, I'm not doing a good job of
teaching you, and I'm going to do
a good job teaching you because
we are going to be able to pass
rush."

Sophomore forward James Murphy led all players with four shots on goal in the loss.

Racine enters year
as No.1 goaltender

ByGREGGARNO
Daily Sports Writer
Featured on sophomore goal-
tender Stave Racine's biography
on the Athletic Department's
website is his list of accomplish-
ments. Included are his career
achievements, highlights from
last season and game-by-game
statistics.
But one category - the shut-
outs - reads different than the
others. Instead
of the number NOTEBOOK
zero, it reads,
"To come."
The phrase, though com-
mon for future milestones on
MGoBlue.com, says a great deal
about the confidence the Michi-
gan hockey team and its coach-
ing staff have in Racine this
season. In the team's first week
of practice, Michigan coach Red
Berenson declared Racine the
Wolverines' starter for their Oct.
9 season opener against Boston
College.
"Now, I think it's a whole dif-
ferent ballgame," Berenson said.
"He's been through a year of the
routine. Of school, and hockey,
and off-ice training and he's had
the ups and downs. Fortunately,
he finished on a high.
"If 90 or 100 percent of the
game is mental, then he's got alot
more confidence going forward."
Last year, it took the Wolver-
ines nearly three quarters of the
season to decide on a starting
netminder, but the way Racine
played at the end of the season
was enough to set him apart.
Racine started the final 10
games of the season, in which
he allowed 2.1 goals per game
and posted an 8-1-1 record. He
also made three saves to assure
Michigan a shootout win in the
regular-season finale against Fer-
ris State.
At the beginning of last year,
Racine was slowed due to a sum-
mer hip surgery that kept him
off the ice for six months. In his
first nine games, he posted a
2-5-2 record, leading Berenson to
rotate goalies for the duration of
the season.
"This is definitely the hard-
est I've worked in the summer,"
Racine said. "Fitness-wise, I'm
much stronger than I was at the
end of last year and especially at
the beginning oflast year."
But Racine's improved season
doesn't guarantee that his spot
is secure for the remainder of
the season, according to Beren-
son. Freshman goaltender Zach

Without King, 'M'
looks to freshmen

0

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Prior to the end of last season,
the Michigan men's tennis team
knew it was losing a one-of-a-
kind player in Big Ten Athlete of
the Year Evan King. When it was
all said and done, the wily vet-
eran became the program's all-
time win leader and arguably the
greatest player it has ever had.
How do you replace that?
Coach Bruce Berque will be
the first to tell you: it starts with
recruiting. And he took a bigstep
toward finding the next King
when he announced the com-
mitments of Tyler Gardiner and
Kevin Wong in January.
Gardiner and Wong certainly
won't be expected to completely
replace King, but Berque hopes
that they bring competiveness
to bolster a deep, senior-heavy
team.
The freshmen feature strik-
ingly different backgrounds.
Gardiner hails from Novi, Mich.,
while Wong grew up in Hong
Kong.
Despite learning the game
thousands of miles apart, Ber-
que sees similar traits in the two
freshmen.
"They are both good athletes
and neither of them are very big
physically," Berque said. "They

are both all-court players and
have hands at the net, allowing
for good doubles skills."
Getting the freshmen to Ann
Arbor, though, was a completely
contrasting process.
Tennisrecruiting.net, an
American tennis recruiting ser-
vice, rated Gardiner as a four-
star recruit after he won the
Michigan state championship his
junior year and placed second his
senior year, amassing a 63-2 high-
school record in the process.
But not even King held his
own during his freshman year
campaign facing the stiff Big Ten
competition.
"In high school, (Gardiner)
was just that much better than
people, but it's a whole new level
he's about to dive into," Berque
said. "For him to continue his
success at the college level, he
will have to outwork his compe-
tition and get more competitive
and not just for the team, but for
himself."
Wong took a different path.
Growing up in Hong Kong, expo-
sure to the U.S.' collegiate system
can be difficult.
However, Wong played several
International Tennis Federation
tournaments, including some in
the United States.
Michigan has had a player
from Hong Kong before. Brian

Hung, a 2006 graduate, is one
of the greatest doubles players
in school history and holds the
record for most doubles wins ina
season. Wongknew about Hung's
success in Ann Arbor before the
recruiting process began, so he
always had an eye on Michigan.
Wong ranked as high as No. 93
in the ITF and has two victories
against blue-chip recruits.
But despite the prior successes,
the freshmen shouldn't expect to
see King's result right away.
"My expectations for them
are to have high expectations
for themselves and to really
push themselves to put them in
a position to help the team in the
lineup," Berque said. "I think it's
a stretch for both and a good goal
for both. We will be constantly
re-evaluating and resetting new
goals as we go along."
King's void inherently leaves
the No. 1 singles and doubles
spots open for competition.
Is it a spot a freshman can
jump into? Probably not, but Ber-
que wouldn't rule it out. After all,
Gardiner and Wong each have
elite doubles skills, while Wong
has three ITF doubles champion-
ships on his resume.
"They are the dark horses,"
Berque said. "I think it's realis-
tic they see the lineup, but also a
stretch."

"Can female students have it all after
graduating from the University?"

with Associate Prof. Elizabeth Armstrong
and Business junior Sumana Palle

Sumana Palle, a Business junior
and executive board member for
What the F feminist magazine,
and Associate Prof. Elizabeth
Armstrong, a sociologist who
specializes in gender and higher
education research, met at The
Michigan Daily newsroom to
discuss this question. Below are
selected excerpts from their con-
versation.
Sumana Palle: I mean, I know the
intention wasn't bad, but when I
first read the question I was kind
of offended, I felt like it was a bit
sexist. It was such a gendered
question as if something different
is expected of male students than
female students. Which it is, in
reality, but I feel like at this point
we should try and combat that as
opposed to asking if it is possible
for females to have the same qual-
ity of life - I felt that the question
was implying - as males.
Prof. Elizabeth Armstrong:
That's interesting. I guess the way
to rephrase the question ... is how
do both men and women kind of
build lives out of college where
they can combine work and fam-
ily, personal and professional suc-
cess, and what are the conditions
for that?
SP: Right, and I felt like the ques-
tion should more be what can we
do to make sure that female stu-
dents can have it all, as vague as
that is. What can we do to make
sure everyone regardless of race,
gender, sexuality, whatever can
have whatever they want to have,
and that should be the question.
EA: Expanding the options.
,,,SP: Right.
EA: But, then of course, that
immediately leads to what are
some of the things that tend to
reduce those options for people.
And of course, that would vary
depending on what kind of group
they're in whether it's gender or
race or disability or sexual orien-

know, one of the things graduat-
ing from the University of Michi-
gan will buy most people, is the
opportunity to have the kind of
quality of work where they'll
have the flexibility where they
will be able to leave work to go to
the doctors appointment where-
as other people aren't going to be
able to have that if they're going
to get fired by taking the time.
SP: Which, going back to what
you were saying about the man
having to sacrifice, that's the
other problem I had with the
question that it kind of made it
seem like only females have to
face this choice but men do too.
EA: Well there's just a lot of
things that it's possible to want.
So, I mean, in that sense there it
comes to a kind of value-based
thing. There's the issue of what
kind of structural arrangements
can be set up to make it possible
for people to have lots of differ-
ent things that they value in their
life but then it's also the case that
it probably isn't possible for any-
body - man or woman - to really
fully engage in the nurturing
of, like, five children and have a
super, super amazingly ambitious
career. I mean, they may be able
to have five children and do that
if they don't actually fully par-
ticipate themselves in the process
of nurturing them, but there is a
finite quality of life. I mean, we're
not going to all climb Mt. Everest
and be president and have ten
children. People are always going
to have to make choices about
what things they care about, and
that's men and women. It's just
women are usually put in that sit-
uation of having to make harder
choices.
SP: I completely agree! ... And I
do see where the question was
coming from, I don't want to
completely bash the question,
but in society, like you said,
women do have to make harder
choices and for us, I feel like it's
always a fight.

making hard choices. So, it
shouldn't be a kind of dichotomy.

the fashion voyeur: military time byadrienneroberts

Fashion has never had what
you would call a "tight-knit rela-
tionship" with feminism. The
associations are seemingly irrec-
oncilable. Feminists traditionally
don't stand for materialism; the
fashion industry doesn't stand
for frumpiness. Yet it's hard to
arguethat fashion isn't a very real
form of self-expression. What we
purchase, and how we put those
pieces together, is a very tangible
statement about who we are and
how we want others to see us.
Fashion is a way to communicate
your identity, whether you're a
feminist or not.
What we're seeing on the run-
way, as well as on the streets of
Ann Arbor, are women dressed in
military inspired clothing, from
lace-up boots to brass-buttoned
jackets. On the runway for the
Fall 2013 season, Michael Kors
showed women dressed in cam-
ouflage mink coats and goggles.
Charlotte Ronson, Rachel Roy
and Rebecca Minkoff all were
inspired by military style. Pra-
bal Gurung perhaps took the
trend most literally, limiting his
entire collection to army green
as the primary color. Accord-
ing to Fashionista.com, Gurung
drew his inspiration from the
measures the U.S. military has
taken to adapt their uniforms to
the growing number of female
troops. Other articles, however,
say that Gurung was inspired
by an all-female conclave in the
Carpathian Mountains where
"womenaresupposedly trained
in the martial arts to build self-
confidence and are generally
empowered to combat a culture
of gender inequality and sexual
trafficking." While the article
notes that this conclave's exis-
tence is questionable, it's cer-
tainly a statement regardless.

When I first came to New Jer-
sey from Bangladesh, I stayed
in a two-bedroom apartment
that was about 1,070 square feet altogether.
I would spend the next 12 years of my life
there. The apartment complex was called
Quail Ridge and located in the suburban
town of Plainsboro. These are the only state-
ments I can make about the place where I
grew up that aren't muddled by conflicting
emotions. The front door was both a cheerful
cherry red as well as a mocking vermillion.
The cube-shaped bedrooms were
both comforting and suffocating.
The living room was a soothing
creme on lazy Sunday afternoons
but an apathetic beige on angry
Friday nights. I rarely called the
place home. It was either my
apartment or simply Quail Ridge
when I described it.
As a 6-year-old, the words
Quail Ridge evoked images of
sharp-eyed quails roosting far
above on the roofs of the build-
ings. I imagined that they spent
their time watching and observ-
ing those below them mercilessly.
It was difficult to tell to what kind
of conclusions they came to from
their observations. These quails
had indiscernible expressions
much like my new classmates
in Mrs. Hansen's second-grade
class. My apartment became the
physical manifestation of all that
was foreign to me in America -
the blue-eyed children, the funny
language and odd food. My house
in Dhaka was a rectangular, pale pink build-
ing sandwiched snugly between a weathered,
mustard-yellow house and an unfinished
seven-story apartment. The apartments
in Plainsboro were surreal in comparison.
Quail Ridge was rows of buildings with red-
shingled roofs and woodenbalconies. I would
wander with my mom through the neighbor-
hood and stare in bewilderment at the uni-
formity of it all. My first month in Plainsboro,
I had trouble remembering which one of the
buildings I was supposed to go to. We had
little furniture and had more take-out than I
ever thought my mom would allow. All of this
led me to the conclusion that this was all a
long vacation. For an extended holiday, I con-
cluded that the apartment was an acceptable
hotel. Home was the house where I woke up
to the noise of construction every morning.
The idea of a holiday was squashed when
I was enrolled into school. I counted down
the days until I could return for the sum-
mer to Bangladesh in June and cried every

August when I was forced to leave. I told
everyone that I went to study in America
and thus could only come home once every
nine months. This pattern continued on for
a while even when I began to notice that
I seemed to have less and less in common
with my friends in Bangladesh each year I
visited. We were living different lifestyles. I
was learning about the American Revolution
and they were learning about the Bangladesh
Liberation War. I used a washing machine
and they had maids. Because of my half-com-

only meant to be placeholders for something
nicer at the "new house." Days congealed
into months and months into years and we
were still living in Quail Ridge. Yet, in those
12 years, we did not change our attitudes
towards the apartment. Explanations, ratio-
nales and excuses were given for why we
had outstayed all of our neighbors and even
the complex's managment companies. The
apartment was small and crowded for a fam-
ily of five. Things like money and jobs always
seemed to get in the way of obtaining another

long existence at Quail Ridge was scattered
everywhere. The wall next to the TV was
marked with a small line of wobbly pencil
marks indicating my long held aspirations of
one day becomingasix-feet tall. The taupe car-
pet in front of my parent's bedroom door was
stained by greenish blue splatters, evidence
of a nine-year-old's attempt to be Van Gogh.
Although the number of bedrooms and
bathrooms in Quail Ridge are the only things
I can describe that aren't entangled with
a slew of emotions, it's all I know about the
new place my parents are mov-
ing to. I don't know how the color
of the front door or the shape of
the room will make me feel. The-
introduction of a foreign loca-
tion makes me want to romanti-
cize what that small apartment
in the quiet town of Plainsboro
meant to me. But as much I want
to pretend as though I always
loved Quail Ridge, I know this
is far from the truth. Home is a
far more malleable concept than
I ever let myself think it could be.
Home has a variety of traditional
definitions. It can be the location
a person originates from or the
place where someone resides.
Home can also be a feeling of
being in harmony with one's sur-
roundings.
Quail Ridge isn't the place
where I amfromnoris itthe place
where I am currently living. My
living environment there was
usually inharmonious. When I
was younger, calling Quail Ridge
home meant that I was rejecting my past and
Bangladeshi roots. As I grew older, I didn't
want to embrace the place because my feel-
ings were at odds with the rest of my family.
My parents didn't consider Quail Ridge home
and neither did my brothers. For my par-
ents, it was a daily reminder of everything
they hadn't accomplished. To my brothers,
it only brought back memories of too many
toothbrushes in the bathroom and endless
shouting in the living room. Would calling
Quail Ridge home mean that I wasn't being
supportive of my parent's hopes or that I was
pretending it didn't hold ugly memories? I
realize now that accepting Quail Ridge aswv
home means I am finally comfortable being
a Bangladeshi American. It means accepting
that home for me is where I have experienced
both painful events but also wonderful ones,
like learning how to read an entire book on
my own or discovering my love for painting.

created clothing for the powerful

But this trend is hardly new.
In World War I, British soldiers
needed coats to keep them warm
in the trenches, and Thomas
Burberry is credited for design-
ing the first ever trench coat. By
the 1940s, the trench coat was
deemed a stylish piece. Since
then, military-inspired styles

have been seen on the runway,
from U.S. army jackets in the
1970s to combat boots in the
1990s.
Military style today has been
stripped of any meaning in sup-
port of the military (if anything,
it's most likely ironic); instead,

pleted education in Bangladesh and my lack
of practice, I slowly forgot how to read and
write Bengali. Quail Ridge became a place
where I didn't have to be ashamed because I
couldn't read the street signs and where my
friends didn't giggle at the notion of living in
apartments that looked like everyone else's.
After a few years in America, my parents
sold our house in Bangladesh to distant rela-
tives. Soon my relatives referred to it as their
home. If the house in Dhaka was no longer
my home, then why didn't that make Quail
Ridge my home by default? Quail Ridge was
supposed to be a transitional place for us, or
at least that is how my parents had planned
it. We never bothered painting the rooms
because it was accepted that we would be
moving out soon. My mom never bothered
to fully decorate the apartment. "I'll get
this when we get our new house," was the
line every time we went to Home Depot or
Lowe's. The sofas, the curtains and even the
dishes we bought for the apartment were all

apartment. The countless disappointments
became the main source of contention for my
family. They became bitter and exhausted.
The apartment mocked my parent's aspira-
tions of having lifestyle as comfortable and
accommodating in America as they had in
Bangladesh.
While my parents spent their days dream-
ing of a pale pink home in America, my
brothers quickly abandoned Quail Ridge.
They were both in college by the time I was
ten. After graduation, they wasted no time
finding places of their own. Quail Ridge was
regarded as a location where they briefly
stayed and a place where they didn't want to
particularly return to.
After I finished high school, my parents
finally found a new place. As I packed for
college and put away the rest of my things in
assorted cardboard boxes, I was surprised by
the sheer number of dusty, dog-eared chapter
books and crumpled science projects appear-
ing from the depths of my closet. Proof of my

Magazine asks campus 'What the F?'
by Stephanie Shenouda

hat would you expect to see
in a University sponsored
feminist magazine? A how-
to on the most effective ways to burn
your bra? A picture of Todd Akin with
a bulls-eye over his face? A hundred
things to say while rejecting the creep
that hit on you at Rick's?
Since early 2012, the monthly magazine
What the F has been working to connect
the women of the University, giving them
a place to go every time they've seen some-
thing in the media or their daily lives that
made them say, "What the eff??"
1.-"Fresh, funny, factual, feminine, femi-
nist, f*ck," is what the "f" stands for in the
magazine title. You're probably not used
to seeing that last word associated with
University publications, but What the F,
the official women's health publication
on campus, has been pushing the enve-
lope ever since its creation two years ago.
What started out as two girls in a women's
health class tasked to find a way to use the
media to promote women's health is now
a monthly publication that prides itself on
bringing "lady Wolverines" accurate infor-
.,.onation in an edgy manner.
LSA senior Jennifer Spears, What the
F president and founding editorial board
member, sees the magazine as a catalyst
for dialogue and discussion regarding
women's health and other issues.
As president, Spears works to expand
What the F's presence beyond the print-
ed magazine by hosting events in order
to allow people to learn more about the
publication and the issues they advocate
for, such as showings of the documentary
"Miss Representation," which criticizes in
the role of women in the American media.
This year, the ladies of What the F plan
to take their stories online with a website
launch in an attempt to expand their read-
ership beyond 2,000 printed copies.
"Aside from being a magazine, What the
F brings social change to campus and gets
a conversation started by bringing these
issues to the forefront," she said. "Working
in a publication that goes to such lengths to
be not racist, sexist or violent really made
me more aware of how much the media is
into those things."
With regards to feminism, Spears hopes
'the magazine dispels the misconceptions
that many have about the movement.
"I think that everyone should be a femi-
nist," she said. "It's not like women are
trying to take over the world, we just want
to be equal and I think people who don't
think that are just misinformed. We're not
man-hating feminists, and we understand
that men also have issues. We just want to

be represented equally."
For Co Editor in Chief Brianna Kovan,
also an LSA senior, her journey with
What the F began with her interest in
publishing.
"I want to pursue (publishing) as a
career, but it's disheartening to see how
many magazines that claim to be aimed at
women end up being very male-centered,"
she said. "The neat part is how (What the
F) combines the literary aspect as well
as social-justice themes, which I'm real-
ly passionate about, but I feel like don't

and fighting for social justice."
Kovan added that people are often
shocked by her beliefs, frequently receiv-
ing the comment that she "doesn't look
like a feminist" - a preconceived idea of
a man-hater with hairy armpits clouding
their ability to hear her message.
"When people say that to me, I just
have to laugh," Kovan said. "It definitely
reminds me why it's important that we
have this publication on campus."
When asked about the shock-factor of
some of their articles, Kovan explained
e-V -neshould

just wanrt to
Spears, LSA senior
that it's one of her favorite things about
What the F.a
"My favorite article was one from last
year where an artist made a compilation
of all of these plaster-cast vaginas," she
said. "The article that went with it talked
about the process and how it was done, as
well as why they did it, and it was really
cool. I think it probably freaked a lot of
people out, but when you take that strong
of a stance on something you're probably
going to do that."
Stories in the publication run the gamut
from personal stories regarding sexual

assault to vagina cupcakes and tips for
finding the perfect vibrator. They've got
opinions about Miley Cyrus's perfor-
mance at MTV's Video Music Awards, the
wage gap, Congressman Todd Akin, Robin
Thicke's "Blurred Lines" and the hetero-
normative nature of the Disney princesses.
LSA senior Jillian McConville said
working at the magazine helped cultivate
her interest in women's issues.
"I fell in love with everything that the
magazine stands for working at What the
F," McConville said.
McConville also admitted that prior to
working with What the F, she was wary
of the F-word.
"Feminist is a very intimidating word
for a lot of people and it carries a lot of
unnecessary negative stereotypes," she
said. "I would have never really told any
of my friends that I was a feminist at the
time, but junior year of college, I had this
realization that I did identify with a lot of
things that feminists stand for and I would
be proud to say it."
McConville added that working for the
magazine has opened her eyes to the reali-
ties of complex women's issues, both at the
University level and on a global scale.
"Working at What the F has helped me
embrace a lot of things about femininity
and also myself, giving me the ability to
observe women in a broader scope," she
said. "As a Christian, white woman, I've
never had to consider what other reli-
gions and races experience in their fight
for their rights and equality, but this has
helped me to see that."
McConville said she appreciates the var-
ied content within the pages of What the F.
"My favorite thing about What the F is
the articles that people have been strong
enough to write about their experiences
with rape and sexual assault, because
I've seen firsthand the impact that it
has on people who read it and have had
a similar experience and are still trying
to find their strength," she said. "But on
the other hand, you'll see some shock-
ing things too, like this portrait that was
done by a really talented artist, made
entirely of period blood. You never know
what you're going to find between the
pages of What the F."
McConville adds that What the F is
made to empower women, taking issues
that seem taboo and making them more
approachable.
"The general consensus is that peri-
ods are super gross and awkward and
we should never talk about them ever,
but newsflash, we all have them, so why
is that weird?"

ion. Trench coats and camouflage
pants don't exactly scream sex,
and women are literally buttoned-
up or laced into their clothing. It's
utilitarian and, furthermore, it's
definitely not a style that's worn
for the attention of a man. This is
women dressing for women at its
finest. This type of clothing, in its
androgyny, effectively obstructs
the male gaze.
Women have been dressing like
this for hundreds of years, wear-
ing clothes that have no explicit sex
appeal and that make references to
women in heroic roles. This is noth-
ing new, yet the fashion industry
and feminists are still not on the
same page. It's interesting that col-
lege women are overwhelmingly
adopting this trend and communi-
cating a very specific identity. It's
by no means overkill; one small
piece, from leather shoulder panels
on a military green jacket to brown
lace-up boots, delivers the message.
I think we're finally seeing the start
of not just the military trend coming
back into style once again, but also
the eventual unification of fashion
and feminism.

4B Wednesday, September 18, 2013 // The Statement

Wednesday, September 18, 2013 // The Staternent B

hey are multinational, multiracial.
They are the GSIs leading your Fri-
day chemistry discussions, your
group members in your Design and
Manufacturing course and researchers scur-
rying around campus labs in white coats. Some
will be management consultants for Accenture.
Others will be computer engineers for Amazon,
Google and Facebook. Big names. Important
names. Still, some will be told to leave.
Chan Woo Kim, a senior studying Industrial
and Operations Engineering, knows this. As
a South Korean citizen who grew up in Hong
Kong, his job search will be harder than usual,
despite graduating with a degree that could nor-
mally land him a nice consulting gig.
"I want to work here," he said, seated in the
basement of Espresso Royale on South Uni-
versity Ave. He paused, then added, "But, ya'
know, that visa thing, that green card, citizen-
ship - it's a big obstacle."
As an international student, Kim is here on
an F-1 visa, which gives graduates with the
minimum of a bachelor's degree or a comparable
degree 12 months of Optional Practical Train-
ing, or OPT. For graduates in science, technol-
ogy, engineering or mathematics that period can
be extended to 29 months. To stay any longer
requires an H-1B visa - a program started in
1990 for temporary immigration to the United
States and is issued for three years but can be
extended to six years.
But H-1B visas are hard to come by. They're
capped at 65,000 per year with an additional
20,000 for holders of U.S. advanced degrees.
Institutions for research and higher educa-

tion are exempt from the annual H-1B visa cap,
according to Louise Baldwin, associate director
of the University's International Center. Which
means even if the 85,000 visas disappear, the
University, for example, could still hire foreign
employees on H-1Bvisas.A companylike Google,
however, could not, which makes securing a job
- and staying in the U.S. after getting a degree -
difficult for international students.
While the immigration reform bill that passed
in the Senate in June would increase the number
of H-lBs to as high as 180,000, it has yet to pass in
the House of Representatives.
A NATIONAL DEBATE AT THE UNIVERSITY
High-tech industries want foreign talent. Just
ask Mark Zuckerberg, whose political action
committee FWD.us was formed to lobby Con-
gress on immigration reform. Other members of
FWD.us's leadership include Reid Hoffman, co-
founder of LinkedIn, AdityaAgarwal, vice presi-
dent of engineering at Dropbox, and Bill Gates.
They want foreign talent with skills their com-
panies can use. This year, the national H-1B visa
cap was reached just five days after the applica-
tions went live. In 2012, it took 10 weeks.
So does it make sense to keep this current
limit inplace when demand is so clearlyoutstrip-
ping supply?
James Duderstadt, University president
emeritus and professor of science and engi-
neering, says no.
"We spend a tremendous amount (of resourc-
es) educating international students of extraor-
dinary talent," he said. "And then when they

finish their degrees, in many cases, they would
like to stay here and we tell them to go away,
which is crazy."
With 21 other corporate and academic
leaders from around the country, Duderstadt
helped author "Research Universities and the
Future of America," a series of 10 recommen-
dations to Congress on how to improve U.S.
research universities.
The study proposes a streamlined process
to give green cards, which allow permanent
residence in the United States, to international
students graduating with master's degrees or
Ph.D.s, keeping them in the country and keeping
the U.S. globally competitive.
In 2009, 55.2 percent of doctorates given to
temporary visa holders were for engineering,
while 42.4 percent were for the physical sci-
ences, according to a national study. At the Uni-
versity from2009 to 2012, international students
accounted for more than 50 percent of total
enrollment in the College of Engineering Mas-
ter's and Ph.D. programs.
"We have universities capable of attracting
talent from around the world," Duderstadt said.
"We ought to make it easy for people we attract
to stay here, if they choose to do so."
Yet, some say international students are
admitted to universities at the expense of citi-
zens from minority groups, such as Latinos,
blacks and Native Americans, that are histori-
cally underrepresented in the science and engi-
neering fields. But Duderstadt, quick to give a
historical analogy, said the nation has always
relied on foreign talent for scientific innovation,
from European immigrants in the twentieth

century to Asian immigrants today.
It gets tricky when universities try to attract
world-class talent and serve local populations
simultaneously. Given the eroding state support for
public universities, you can't really do both, he said.
"The University of Michigan is kind of on a
knife edge right now," he said. "I don't think
we have the answer yet of how we meet both
the public purpose of public universities in this
country, which is to serve a very gross spectrum
of our population, and at the same time act as
a talent magnet to recruit United States talent
from around the world that kind of fuels our
economy and provides leadership."
Most foreign nationals pay full international
tuition, with few scholarships available to them.
This, too, jeopardizes a public institution's pur-
pose, especially if it purports to serve the "com-
mon man," Duderstadt said.
"Public universities are attracting a very large
number of wealthy international students that
come with the capacity to pay $50,000 a year for
their education," he said. "To the degree that the
common man is being redefined as someone that
can pay $50,000 a year, we're not meeting our
public purpose."
Kim agreed.
"It takes a huge toll in terms of finances,"
said Kim, the engineering senior, who pays full
tuition. "But the way I look at it, it's a good invest-
ment as long as I stay dedicated to my program."
But why is ita good investment for Kim, given
the tough visa requirements? According to Dud-
erstadt, the reason is simple: he's needed. Those
who need him - high-tech industries - are
pushing hard to get him to stay.

"We're just not producing enough of these
folks in the United States," Duderstadt said.
HIGH AND LOW (TECH) CLASSES
In scientific circles, there's a debate that goes
something like this: Businesses say they can't find
the talent they need in the domestic labor market.
Criticssaythetalentishere,butforeignworkersare
preferable because they work for cheaper wages.
"What is happening is that the people who run
this industry are getting everything they want,
and the workers are being completely ignored,"
Kim Berry, president of the Programmers Guild,
told The Verge, a technology news publication, in
July. "American workers are being passed over in
favor of foreign workers who make far less money,
and politicians seem oblivious to our plight."
According to a study done in May at the
Brookings Institution, an independent research
think tank based in Washington, D.C., workers
on H-1Bvisas are paid more than their American
counterparts working the same jobs.
In 2010, there were 5,439 H-1B engineers
between the ages of26 and 30 whose wages aver-
aged $75,376. Their American counterparts aver-
aged $65,686. Likewise, for engineers ages 31-35,
there were 4,580 H-1B engineers whose wages
averaged $82,604 while their American counter-
parts averaged $78,195.
"For every prominent H-1B occupational cate-
gory, except life scientists and operations special-
ties managers, wage growth was stronger than
the national average since 2009,"the reportstates.
Though this appears to contradict the image
of H-1B workers as exploited and underpaid, the

report also says "about 25 percent" of H-1B visa
requests are for jobs that don't require more than
an associate's degree, meaning "the current U.S.
workforce could be trained to do these jobs at rela-
tively little cost" instead of relying on foreign labor.
And according to a February report from
Computerworld, the majority of H-1Bvisa recipi-
ents receive training in the U.S. and then return
to their home countries to continue working.
According to The Verge, "the largest employers
of H-1B workers aren't firms like Facebook and
Microsoft, they are actually outsourcing compa-
nies like InfoSys, Tata and Wiproc."
This indicates high-skilled international sci-
entists and engineers fill vital, otherwise vacant,
highly-paid positions, while the mid-level IT
worker is competing with someone willing to
take a slightly smaller paycheck.
"GIVING BACK TO THE
COMMUNITY I GREW UP IN"
Chandramouli Nagarajan, a senior study-
ing mechanical engineering, wants to go home,
one day. Born in India, he grew up in Ghana and
considers it home. A smile breaks across his face
as he describes the markets, beaches and warm
weather he was raised in. He talks about "giving
back to the community (he) grew up in" since
Ghana's economy is developing and growing -
he wants to be a part of that change, using the
skills he gained here.
But first he needs experience, American experi-
ence.He'sonlyjuststartingthejobhunt,but already
the harsh reality of finding an employer willing to
sponsor him for his visa is beginning to sink in.

"You see a hundred job postings online," he
said."Thenyouhitthat check mark saying'accept-
ing international' and it easily goes down to like 10
or even less than that. So that's pretty scary."
Not to mention the visa hunt.
"They have a quota on how many H-1 visas
they give out," he said. "And that disappears.
Like every year it fills up within a week and then
it disappears totally."
Kerri Boivin, director of the College of Engi-
neering's Career Center, said she frequently
encounters companies unwilling to hire inter-
national students. They could put all their
resources into hiring a student, only to have that
student's visa application rejected.
"Duringtheir recruiting in the fall, if they have
a domestic student and an international student
who have the same qualifications, they're mostly
going to go with the domestic student," she said.
Companies most likely to hire foreign
graduates, she said, are those that do not have
government contracts and do not require a
security clearance.
In "Is American Science in Decline?", Sociol-
ogy Prof. Yu Xie, one of the paper's co-authors,
argues that salaries for science careers have not
kept pace with highly-educated fields such as
law, medicine and business, thus lowering the
cost of doing science in the United States., while
also makingscientific careers less attractive.
Moreover, "science is globalized," Xie said,
and undergraduate science training in coun-
tries like India, China and South Korea is often
comparable to that in the United States While
it's known that elementary math and science
educations are lacking in the United States, it

still has the best graduate programs in these
fields, he said.
Given recent trends of foreign graduates
returning to their home countries to live and
work, he says it's necessary to make the United..
States an attractive place to live and work for
skilled graduates in STEM fields. Otherwise,
they'll leave, he said.
"H-lB problems? Pivot to Canada,' reads a
billboard in California, an attempt to attract
the brightest tech wizzes out of Silicon Valley
and into Canada, a country with more lax visa
requirements.
In the past year, Boivin cited an increase of
companies hiring international students to work
at branches in their home countries.
Will Nagarajan work for a branch of Dow
Chemical or Exxon Mobil in Ghana or India?
For now, like most seniors, he's figuring it out,
with an added twist - he could be forced to leave
after spendingupwards of $200,000 for his edu-
cation. Lately, he's begun to think aboutcongres-
sional policy for the first time. He has to. After
all, it could seriously affect him.
"(Companies are) looking to hire very-W
advanced technical-skills people. But ... there
aren't necessarily Americans that have those
skills," he said. "I guess the policies were mostly
probably made to keep jobs for Americans. And, I
mean, I agree with them."
He paused, rubbing his hands together,
thinking.
"But if there isn't really an American who can
fit the job then shouldn't the company be given
the free chance to bring in the international per-
son who can do the job?"
