“Undergraduate 
women 
remain the most at-risk for 
experiencing 
nonconsensual 
touching 
or 
penetration 
since enrolling at U-M at 
34.3 percent, down from 38.2 
percent in 2015,” according to 
U-M Public Affairs. 
The survey also said there 
is a statistically significant 

difference 
in 
rates 
of 
“nonconsensual 
sexual 
contact” between heterosexual 
students and members of the 
LGBTQ+ community.
“Non-heterosexual students 
(gay or lesbian, other or 
multiple categories) had a 
prevalence rate of 19.8 percent 
and 
heterosexual 
students 
had a rate of 11.8 percent,” 
according to the survey. 
LSA junior Sidney Aloisi, 
co-coordinator 
of 
Sexual 

Assault 
and 
Prevention 
Awareness Center, discussed 
how 
important 
it 
is 
to 
recognize 
women 
are 
not 
the only victims of sexual 
assault. Trans and LGBTQ+ 
students 
also 
experience 
disproportionately high rates 
of sexual assault.
“I know, historically, a lot 
of people in the trans and 
LGBTQ+ community have a 
big, drastic difference,” Aloisi 
said. “I know that they can be 

very close to women, number 
wise. I think that’s something 
that’s important. I think a lot 
of times we say women are 
the only victims, those are the 
only people that we talk about, 
and that’s really not the case 
… for the trans community, 
it was very similar to the 
women’s statistics, which is 
interesting if you think about 
it.”

The University of Michigan 
will host a presidential debate in 
fall 2020, University President 
Mark Schlissel announced Friday 
morning. 
In the press release, Schlissel 
said the University has prioritized 
public 
service 
and 
civic 
engagement in its educational 
mission.
“This 
is 
a 
tremendous 
opportunity for the university 
community to contribute to our 
democracy, 
while 
setting 
an 
example of civic engagement 
and shining a light on the 
outstanding academic strengths 
of 
our 
institution,” 
Schlissel 
said. “Public service and civic 
engagement are at the core of our 
great university and its history.”
The debate will be held at the 
Crisler Center on Oct. 15, 2020. 
Schlissel said the University will 
schedule programming related to 
the debate in classes and across 
campus. 
“For generations, the University 
of Michigan has led the way in 
advancing understanding of our 
nation’s most pressing issues 
— and next year our students, 
faculty and staff will have a novel 

opportunity 
to 
enhance 
this 
essential quality of our mission at 
the national level,” Schlissel said.
In a statement, Congresswoman 
Debbie Dingell, who represents 
Ann Arbor, said the choice to host 
the debate in Ann Arbor will put 
Michigan at the forefront of the 
2020 election.
“This election will be the 
most important of a generation,” 
Dingell said. “It is important that 
we listen to all sides. Democracy 
relies on vigorous debate and 
freedom of speech. The University 
of Michigan is driven by a 
fundamental belief in the need for 
open dialogue in the democratic 
process so its students, the 
citizens of the State of Michigan, 
and the citizens across the world 
engage with and participate in the 
electoral process.” 
Former 
President 
Gerald 
R. Ford is a University alum, 
and the Ford School of Public 
Policy, which is helping lead the 
University’s debate initiative, is 
named after him. Dingell said the 
University was perfectly placed to 
host the debate.
“As 
one 
of 
our 
nation’s 
premier 
public 
institutions, 
the University of Michigan is 
uniquely situated to host a debate 
experience of the highest caliber 
at this critical moment in our 
nation’s history,” Dingell said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Hundreds 
of 
people 
attended 
the 
fourth 
Democratic 
Debate 
on 
Tuesday night at Otterbein 
University in Westerville, 
Ohio. The debate was hosted 
by CNN and The New York 
Times and was moderated 
by CNN anchors Anderson 
Cooper and Erin Burnett and 
New York Times national 
editor Marc Lacey.

The debate featured a 
record number of candidates, 
with 12 presidential hopefuls 
qualifying under Democratic 
National Committee rules. 
All 
candidates 
registered 
at least 2 percent in four 
qualifying 
polls 
and 
received donations from at 
least 130,000 online donors. 
This is the first debate to 
take place since the House of 
Representatives opened its 
impeachment inquiry into 
President Donald J. Trump, 
which was the first topic 
discussed 
by 
candidates. 

All 
the 
candidates 
on 
stage voiced support for 
impeachment. 
Moderators 
challenged them to justify 
continued 
impeachment 
proceedings 
despite 
the 
upcoming election. 
Cooper began the debate 
by asking the candidates if 
President Donald Trump’s 
fate 
should 
be 
decided 
by the electorate at the 
voting booth or through an 
impeachment 
inquiry 
in 
Washington.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of 
Massachusetts 
responded 

first, 
emphasizing 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
impeachment 
inquiry 
in 
light of evidence of Trump’s 
unconstitutional behavior.
“Sometimes 
there 
are 
issues that are bigger than 
politics and I think that’s the 
case with this impeachment 
inquiry,” 
Warren 
said. 
“Impeachment is the way 
that we establish that this 
man will not be permitted to 
break the law over and over 
without consequences.”

Late 
Tuesday 
morning, 
Bobby Reyes, a 14-year-old boy 
who was pronounced brain 
dead after suffering an asthma 
attack on Sept. 21, died when 
mechanical 
ventilation 
was 
discontinued in his room at C.S. 
Mott Children’s Hospital. 
After Reyes went into cardiac 
arrest on Sept. 21, doctors at 
Michigan Medicine determined 
Reyes had no brain activity and 
would be removed from life 
support on Sept. 27. In response, 
Reyes’ family reached out to 
an attorney to request a court 
order that extended Reyes’ time 
on life support. 
Reyes’ death occurred hours 
after 
Circuit 
Court 
Judge 
David S. Swartz dismissed the 
lawsuit at a hearing. He argued 
the 
Washtenaw 
County’s 
22nd Circuit Court lacks any 
jurisdiction 
over 
the 
case, 
and only the Michigan Court 
of Claims could handle the 
decision.

Two University of Michigan 
reports reveal diverging trends 
in sexual assault and misconduct 
on campus, according to numbers 
from a campus climate survey 
released 
Tuesday 
and 
the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security report from two weeks 
ago.
The University was one of 
33 schools across the country 
to participate in the Campus 
Climate Survey on Sexual Assault 
and Misconduct, which was 
sponsored by the Association of 
American Universities, as a follow 
up to a similar survey in 2015. 
The 
survey 
highlights 
differences in sexual assault 
rates for minority populations, 
women, members of the LGBTQ+ 
community and students with 
disabilities. 
The 
rates 
have 
decreased overall since 2015. 
According 
to 
the 
survey, 
one in three women report 
nonconsensual 
touching 
or 
penetration on campus.

Numbers 
differ on 
sex crimes

Instead 
of 
seeing 
the 
Goodyear blimp from 1,500 
feet below on game day, 
people now have a chance 
to spend a night in the 
aircraft. In honor of the 
150th anniversary of college 
football, Airbnb is offering 
two fans the opportunity to 
stay aboard the Goodyear 

blimp in anticipation of the 
University of Michigan versus 
Notre Dame football game.
Airbnb spokesperson Jinny 
deCarlos Davoudi wrote in 
an email to The Daily that 
Goodyear was very interested 
in 
partnering 
with 
the 
company.
“We have been in touch 
with 
Goodyear 
who 
was 
keen to list the blimp as a 
unique space on Airbnb,” 
she said. “We loved the idea 

and supported them in the 
renovation of the blimp so 
that it is a place that can 
accommodate an overnight 
stay and in publicizing the 
listing.”
In honor of the listing 
being the first of its kind, 
Airbnb and Goodyear will 
collectively donate $5,000 to 
the Cotton Bowl Foundation, 
an 
organization 
dedicated 
to 
supporting 
educational 
organizations in North Texas. 

Football 
fans 
can 
temporarily rent the blimp 
through 
Airbnb 
for 
$150 
a night plus taxes on the 
evenings of Oct. 22, 23 and 
24. To ensure people have the 
chance to book, availability 
will be added for the three 
individual one-night stays 
as reservations will go live 
throughout the day on Oct. 
15.

Democrats talk impeachment, 
drawbacks of Medicare for All


After Former U.S. Rep. Sander 
Levin agreed to give documents 
from his time in the House of 
Representatives to the Bentley 
Historical 
Library’s 
archives, 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
hosted the Congressman and 
several members of his family on 
Monday evening to celebrate his 
history in public service.
Levin represented Michigan’s 
17th District from 1983-1993, 12th 
District from 1993-2013 and 9th 
District from 2013-2019. He was 
chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee in 2010, 
helped to pass the Affordable Care 
Act and played a pivotal role in 
shaping economic policy. Levin is 
currently working as a professor 
of practice and Distinguished 
Policymaker in Residence at the 
School of Public Policy. 

According 
to 
Terrence 
McDonald, director of the Bentley 
Historical Library, the library’s 
archives include papers from 
former U.S. Rep. John Dingell, 
D-District 12, former U.S. Senator 
Carl Levin, D-Mich., — Sander 
Levin’s brother — as well as 
several former governors of the 
state of Michigan. 
Materials stored in the Bentley 
Historical Library’s archives are 
held in bankers boxes, each of 
which measures out to one foot. 
Sander Levin’s documents equate 
to over 700 feet, indicating the 
breadth of material to be collected 
and accessible to the public for 
future research in approximately 
one year.
In an interview with The Daily, 
McDonald explained the process 
behind bringing Sander Levin’s 
documents to the collections. 
“We try to contact members 
of the Michigan congressional 

delegation, governor of the state, 
(and) senators the year before or so 
their terms are coming to an end,” 
McDonald said. “We want to build 
— and we have — a substantial 
collection of all the officeholders’ 
(documents) in the state.” 
After a brief reception in Weill 
Hall, McDonald provided opening 
remarks in the Vandenberg Room, 
introducing community members 
to speak on Sander Levin’s history 
in 
public 
service. 
University 
President Mark Schlissel praised 
the Bentley Historical Library and 
the opportunities for scholarship 
and 
research 
Sander 
Levin’s 
papers would provide. 
“I’d especially like to thank 
Congressman Sander Levin for his 
service to the people of Michigan 
and to our nation,” Schlissel 
said. “That service will live on in 
perpetuity as he’s generously made 
his papers available to students, 
faculty and scholars by donating 
them of course to the Bentley 
Historical Library. There they 
can enlighten and encourage 
and inspire all those who read 
them and use them.”
Public 
Policy 
Dean 
Michael 
Barr 
reflected 
on his experiences with 
Sander Levin when they 
both 
held 
positions 
in 
public service.
“It’s been a real honor to 
have had a chance to work 
with him when I was in the 
government and to see first 
hand the extraordinary work 
that he did in the halls of 
Congress fighting for working 
people, fighting for families 
throughout his career,” Barr 
said.
Barr 
also 
explained 
students and staff appreciate 
the work Sander Levin has 
been doing at the Public 
Policy School. Sander Levin 
currently co-teaches a class 
with former Public Policy 
Dean Susan Collins titled 
“Policy 
Design, 
Strategy 
and 
Practice” 
with 
a 
particular focus on trade and 
unemployment policy. 

Taubman and LSA sophomore 
Jared Freeman attended the event 
because of his family’s connection 
to the Levin family. Freeman 
said he enjoyed hearing how 
the University is using Levin’s 
experiences to serve students on 
campus.
“It was cool to hear the 
perspective on how Sandy can 
apply 
his 
actual 
experiences 
battling different legislation in 
Congress to kind of apply that to 
his teaching and to the students 
taking his class,” Freeman said.
At 
the 
event, 
McDonald 
introduced Sen. Carl Levin to 
speak about his brother. The two 
brothers are the longest serving 
pair of siblings in congressional 
history. Carl Levin described his 
brother’s work in public service 
before being elected to Congress, 
focusing on the experience the 
archives will show.
“There’s a goldmine in his 
archives,” Carl Levin said. “It’s 
a 
goldmine 
of 
intelligence, 
of learning, of the lessons of 
experience from 36 years in the 
House, the lessons of learning how 
to fight … for average people who 
need fighters. And Sandy’s always 
been there.”
McDonald 
also 
moderated 
a 
brief 
conversation 
on 
policymaking with Sander Levin. 
Sander Levin expressed gratitude 
for the opportunity to teach at the 
Public Policy School.
“Carl and I faced this issue as 
we were retiring: what we would 
do next,” Sander Levin said. “This 
University...has provided us with a 
chance to carry on, and what more 
could we do … than to be with the 
next generation?”
Sander 
Levin 
ultimately 
explained his hope that those 
who interact with the collections 
will be able to learn from his 
Congressional work.
“The archives there represent 
the efforts of so many people,” 
Sander Levin said. “What Carl and 
I are trying to do is to take these 
documents and to extract lessons 
from them that will be useful for 
the future.”

Opinions on Clarence Thomas cut across race, sex 

October 15, 1991
The tumultuous debate that 
has swept the country over the 
Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill 
hearings has left University 
students deeply divided.
Riddled with diametrically 
opposing forces - Black and 
white, man and woman - the 
Senate hearings have yielded 
student opinions that do not 
conform to any strict patterns. 
Within the Black community, 
opinions differ among women. 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Jessica 
Daniels 
threw 
her 
support behind Prof. Hill.
“My support for Professor 
Hill has nothing to do with 
her being an African-American 
female,” she said. “If she’s 

proven wrong she has a lot to 
lose.”
Baker-Mandela 
Center 
(BMC) 
Director 
Latrice 
Dixon also said she considers 
Hill’s 
accusations 
accurate. 
Furthermore she said she saw 
the issue of sexual harassment 
rather than that of race as the 
salient issue.
“(Prof. Hill) has been a 
symbol for so many women 
who are reluctant to bring 
sexual harassment forward,” 
she said. 
Yet not all women said 
Thomas should suffer for his 
past behavior. First-year LSA 
student Dyann Logwood said 
she believes Clarence Thomas 
sexually harassed Anita Hill, 

but
should not be penalized for 
his past actions now.
“Since it happened 10 years 
ago I think he would realize 
that that’s a mistake that he 
made and life goes on.” 
Rejection from the Supreme 
Court on this incident alone, 
she said, would be unjust. Yet 
other women saw Hill as the 
opposition’s vehicle to the 
destruction of a Black Supreme 
Court nominee.
LSA senior Cherron Rowland 
said, “She’s being paid-off. The 
whole thing is a set-up against 
him.”
“I think they are making 
him an example that Black 
people can’t be involved in 

the Supreme Court or higher 
positions.”
Other women denounced the 
Senate’s handling of the sexual 
harassment charges and called 
their actions insensitive.
“What I’m most angry about 
is that those 98 men will never 
understand her fear of not 
exposing this earlier,” said RC 
senior Abigail Warwick.
In 
response 
to 
Hill’s 
potential 
credibility 
gap 
of never detailing Thomas’ 
actions to friends, Warwick 
says, “It was very professional 
of her not to talk of the graphic 
details with her friends who 
defended her.”
Among men, disagreement 
also 
cut 
across 
racial 

boundaries.
Although 
opposed 
to 
Thomas’ political views, LSA 
senior 
Anthony 
Haralson, 
expressed 
remorse 
over 
witnessing what he called an 
“obvious conspiracy” to derail 
Thomas.
“I feel sad that these are 
supposed to be the better 
people of our race and they
are being pitted against each 
other,” he said.
Haralson 
questioned 
Hill’s accusation of sexual 
harassment, “I believe Anita 
Hill perceives she was sexually 
harrased.”
But Haralson pointed to 
Thomas’ 
otherwise 
clean 
record as evidence attesting 

to his probable innocence. 
“I don’t think when sexual 
harassment happens, that is an 
isolated thing.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Oscar 
Daniels 
agreed 
that 
Hill’s 
accusations may have been 
merely twisted perceptions.
“They may have had a close 
relationship where he believed 
that he could joke around about 
certain subjects and Anita not 
be offended by them. She was 
but she kept it inside… had he 
known, I think he would have 
stopped completely,” he said.
LSA sophomore Tony Pitts 
echoed 
this 
sentiment. 
“It 
would be different if she would 
have come forward at the 
beginning.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South 
Bend, Ind., has called for bipartisan 
support 
of 
the 
impeachment 
inquiry. Buttigieg said he still 
supports the impeachment inquiry, 
which is largely supported by 
Democrats, with one Independent 
— Rep. Justin Amash of Grand 
Rapids — backing the effort.
“Well, it’s a mistake on the part 
of Republicans, who enable the 
president whose actions are as 
offensive to their own supposed 
values as they are to the values 
that we all share,” Buttigieg said. 
“It’s also about the presidency 
itself, because a president 10 years 
or 100 years from now will look 
back at this moment and draw the 
conclusion either that no one is 
above the law or that a president 
can get away with anything.”
In response to Trump’s call for 
an investigation into Joe Biden’s 
son Hunter, Cooper asked former 
Vice President Joe Biden about the 
appropriateness of a president’s 
family having foreign business 
entanglements. 
Biden 
referenced 
his 
son’s 
statement, which was released 
Tuesday morning, and dismissed 
the importance of this topic. 
“My son did nothing wrong, I 
did nothing wrong. I carried out 
the policy of the U.S. government 
by rooting out corruption in 
Ukraine,” Biden said. “What we 
have to do now is focus on Donald 

Trump. He doesn’t want me to be 
the candidate. He’s going after 
me because he knows, if I get the 
nomination, I will beat him like a 
drum.”
Another hot-button issue — and 
a conversation continued from the 
last three debates — was health 
care. Warren and Sen. Bernie 
Sanders of Vermont continued 
their joint effort in emphasizing 
the push for Medicare for All, 
while moderate candidates such as 
Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar 
of 
Minnesota 
criticized 
such 
proposals.
In discussing her Medicare For 
All plan, Warren suggested taxes 
would be proportionally applied 
to corporations and the wealthy, 
while not directly addressing if it 
would affect the middle class. In 
contrast, Sanders acknowledged 
there would be tax increases for 
the middle class.
“I do think it is appropriate to 
acknowledge that taxes will go 
up. They’re gonna up significantly 
for the wealthy and for virtually 
everybody,” Sanders said. “The tax 
increase will be substantially less 
— substantially less — than what 
they were paying for premiums 
and out-of-pocket expenses.”
Klobuchar argued Warren was 
not being honest about the true 
price of her health care plans. 
“At least Bernie’s being honest 
here and saying how he’s going to 
pay for this,” Klobuchar said. “I 
think we owe it to the American 
people to tell them where we will 
send the invoice.”

Klobuchar said the best way to 
tackle affordable healthcare is to 
build off Obamacare. 
“The difference between a plan 
and a pipe dream is something 
that you can actually get done. 
And we can get this public option 
done,” Klobuchar said. “I believe 
the best and boldest idea here is 
to not trash Obamacare but to 
do exactly what Barack Obama 
wanted to do from the beginning 
and that’s have a public option that 
would bring down the cost of the 
premium and expand the number 
of people covered and take on the 
pharmaceutical companies.”
Biden took the mention of 
the Affordable Care Act as an 
opportunity to highlight his role in 
the implementation of the plan. 
He 
claimed 
proponents 
of 
Medicare for All plan are not 
transparent about its costs and the 
long process of implementation. 
“I think it’s awfully important 
to be straightforward with (the 
American public),” Biden said. 
“The plan is going to cost at least 
$30 trillion over 10 years. That 
is more on a yearly basis than the 
entire federal budget.”
The 
group 
also 
discussed 
the 
threat 
of 
automation 
to 
American jobs, with entrepreneur 
Andrew Yang advocating for his 
cornerstone policy of a $1,000 
stipend 
a 
month, 
known 
as 
universal basic income. 

The survey also provided 
findings regarding bystander 
intervention. 
According 
to 
the survey, out of 15.3 percent 
of students who witnessed a 
situation they believed could 
have led to sexual assault, 
75.2 percent took some type 
of action, with 44.9 percent 
directly intervening. 
Aloisi explained intervening 
in situations involving sexual 
assault can be hard. She said 
this statistic was impressive.
“I was really happy to see 
that the statistics were going 
on an upward trend for people 
that were being bystanders and 
bystander intervention,” Aloisi 
said. “I think that was a really 
surprising statistic for me, 
just because it is very hard to 
intervene.”
The DPSS report contradicts 
the Campus Climate Survey
According 
to 
the 
DPSS 
report, the number of reported 
on-campus sexual assaults at 
the University of Michigan has 
increased significantly. Forty-
five rapes were reported in 
2018, compared to the 18 rapes 
reported the year before. 
According to Heather Young, 
DPSS Director for Strategic 
Communications, one of the 
reasons for the increase could 
be due to survivors feeling 
more comfortable reporting 
assaults to the police as a result 
of the Me Too movement. 
“It’s hard to say definitively, 
but there are a couple of things 
that are a national trend that 
I think could help contribute 
to that increase,” Young said. 
“The first thing would be the 
Me Too movement. And this 
is actually documented in a 
government report that has 
shown that survivors of sexual 
assault were more likely to tell 
the police of the incident in 
2017 than in the previous year. 
We’re seeing that in general, 
police stations do have a long 
struggle to make sure that 
survivors of sexual assault 

report such crimes, but this 
report suggests the Me Too 
movement has helped take 
reporting sexual assault to law 
enforcement and people feel 
more comfortable reporting to 
law enforcement.”
Aloisi also believes the Me 
Too movement influenced the 
increase in reports, along with 
individuals in the University 
community 
sharing 
their 
stories.
“Looking around us, and 
seeing what the world’s been 
doing with sexual assault, a 
lot of people have been coming 
forward, and I think that 
probably has a big influence 
on why people are choosing to 
come forward,” Aloisi said. “It 
can seem almost like healing 
when you see someone else 
who’s experienced the same 
thing be brave and come out 
and tell their stories. It almost 
influences a person to want to 
do the same thing.”
Young also believes DPSS’s 
efforts 
to 
communicate 
resources to students could 
have brought about the increase 
in reports of on-campus rapes. 
“From 
our 
end, 
this 
is 
hard 
to 
measure, 
but 
we 
do invest in our staff and 
in 
our 
communications 
to 
our 
community 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
reporting,” 
Young said. “And we’ve worked 
really hard to make it more 
comfortable for survivors.”
Aloisi said while there is 
always more work to be done, 
she thinks the University is 
doing a good job.
I think that we can always 
do 
more, 
there 
is 
always 
progress to be done, but I think 
Michigan is doing a good job,” 
Aloisi said. “I think people 
don’t really know how difficult 
of a process it is to work with 
the court system and the legal 
system surrounding Title IX … 
This University is here for us.”
University resources
Some of these resources 
available to survivors include 
a special victims unit, which 
specifically serves victims of 
interpersonal violence, such 
as sexual assault, domestic 

violence, dating violence or 
stalking. 
The 
University’s 
police department has also 
engaged with the Start by 
Believing 
campaign, 
which 
aims to raise awareness about 
sexual assault and its victims.
According to Young, the 
Ann Arbor Police Department, 
Eastern Michigan University, 
St. Joseph’s Mercy Hospital, 
Michigan 
Medicine, 

University 
Health 
Services, 
the prosecutor’s office and 
the sheriff’s office have all 
followed 
DPSS’s 
lead 
and 
adopted the Start by Believing 
campaign as well. 
Another one of the ways 
DPSS fosters communication 
with 
students 
in 
different 
communities in Ann Arbor 
is via the work of the DPSS 
Student 
Advisory 
Board, 
a student-led group at the 
University that speaks with 
DPSS 
representatives 
to 
shed light on campus safety 
concerns and offer feedback 
on DPSS’s efforts to address 
different issues in the area.
Stephen 
Bonesteel, 
vice 
chair of the DPSS Student 
Advisory 
Board 
and 
LSA 
senior, 
encourages 
students 
to take advantage of the many 
resources available to them.
“I just would encourage 
a message to be voiced that 
DPSS and their Special Victims 
Unit 
is 
really 
fantastic,” 
Bonesteel said. “We work with 
SAPAC every day, and there’s 
just numerous resources if 
people don’t want to go all 
the way with a formal report 
and 
investigation. 
DPSS, 
our officers in the Special 
Victims Unit … They’re here 
for everybody and they’re here 
for you … just to make sure that 
message is heard.”
Bonesteel 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
these 
resources, noting that relying 
on statistical reports is not 
enough, 
particularly 
when 
dealing with sensitive issues 
like sexual violence.

Those lucky enough to 
book a reservation will also 
earn seats close to the field 
for the game, according to 
Airbnb. 
According to the listing, the 
stay will include the complete 
tailgating 
experience 
— 
minus the back of a pickup 
truck. 
Accommodations 
include a “football lounge” 
where guests will be able 
to watch some of the most 
historical 
football 
rivalry 
games in college football. 
It will also include space 
for four friends to join the 
revelry during the day, along 
with access to a lakefront 
camping space with a grill, 
fire pit, cornhole toss and 
other tailgating festivities. 
Jerry Hissem, Airbnb host 
and pilot of the blimp, said 
he wants to give fans an 
unforgettable experience.
“The blimp has always 
been about the fans and 
giving them a better way 

to experience the game,” 
Hissem 
said. 
“We’re 
continuing this tradition by 
giving fans an experience 
they’ll never forget by listing 
the blimp on Airbnb.”
The guests will also get 
a 
tour 
of 
the 
Goodyear 
facilities, 
located 
in 
Mogadore, Ohio, to meet 
the crew and learn about 
the blimp’s 100 year history 
and more than 60 years of 
providing aerial coverage of 
college football games. Guests 
will have exclusive access to 
the blimp’s 312-yard hangar, 
where it will remain during 
the 
booking. 
The 
guests’ 
sleeping quarters are located 
in the aircraft’s gondola, 
which is complete with a bed, 
couch and a lounging corner. 
They will also receive official 
University football gear to 
wear to the Notre Dame 
football game on Oct. 26.
Kinesiology senior Claire 
DiFranco is a long time 
Michigan football fan and 
said the idea is very exciting 
and unique.
“I think this would be an 
experience like no other and 

the price is very reasonable,” 
DiFranco 
said. 
“I 
would 
totally consider doing this 
before the game … I think it’s 
a really cool idea and it’ll be 
very popular for the alumni 
crowd.”
Shortly after the stay, the 
blimp will be retired and 
inducted into the College 
Football Hall of Fame, where 
it will be the first non-player 
or coach to be given this 
honorable distinction.
YouTuber 
Levi 
Kelly 
frequently stays in unusual 
Airbnbs and announced he 
plans on making a reservation 
for the blimp when they 
become available.
“I actually have a Youtube 
channel 
basically 
around 
unique Airbnb’s,” Kelly said. 
“I stay in some like tiny 
homes, container homes, or 
anything that’s special and 
do reviews on them. So when 
I saw that the blimp was up 
for 
grabs, 
I 
immediately 
wanted to book it.”

According to Swartz, any 
action other than dismissing the 
case was void. Swartz’s decision 
reversed 
the 
Washtenaw 
County’s 22nd Circuit Court 
Sept. 30 order, which delayed 
taking Reyes off life support 
indefinitely 
and 
allowed 
the family to seek out other 
treatment facilities. 
At the hearing on Tuesday 
morning, 
Swartz 
said 
he 
sympathized with Reyes’ family 
but only had the power to 
dismiss the case.
“I have no authority to do 
anything,” Swartz said. “My 
hands are tied.”
Mary Masson, director of 
public relations for Michigan 
Medicine, wrote in a statement 
to The Daily that a brain 
examination Tuesday revealed 
Reyes had no detectable brain 
activity and could no longer 
legally remain on life support. 
“Further 
testing— 
including 
an 
electrical 
encephalogram (EEG) and 

a cerebral blood flow study 
— 
detected 
no 
electrical 
activity and no blood flow 
to Bobby’s brain,” Masson 
wrote. “By law in Michigan, 
an 
individual 
is 
dead 
who has sustained either 
irreversible 
cessation 
of 
circulatory and respiratory 
functions 
or 
irreversible 
cessation of all function of 
the entire brain, including 
the brain stem. Continuing 
medical interventions was 
inappropriate after Bobby 
had suffered brain death 
and violates the professional 
integrity 
of 
Michigan 
Medicine’s clinicians.”
After the Sept. 30 ruling, 
Reyes’ family and his team at 
Michigan Medicine contacted 
nearly 20 hospitals in order to 
arrange a transfer for Reyes 
to 
receive 
alternate 
care. 
According 
to 
Masson, 
all 
facilities declined to take Reyes 
as their patient. 
After the hearing, William 
Amadeo, 
the 
attorney 
representing Reyes’ family, said 
Michigan Medicine’s reputation 
as a top hospital has made other 

facilities around the country 
reluctant 
to 
question 
the 
University’s decisions. 
“Whenever 
any 
qualified 
(facility) makes a ruling, it’s 
hard to find a facility to counter 
that,” Amadeo said.
Amadeo noted there were 
three physicians at hospitals 
around 
the 
country 
who 
believed Reyes had a chance of 
survival if allowed to remain 
on life support. He said the case 
should have been filed in the 
Court of Claims, rather than 
the circuit court, and requested 
a 48-hour stay from Swartz 
in order to file in the Court of 
Claims. 
After the hearing, Amadeo 
told The Daily the attorneys 
were 
working 
to 
file 
an 
emergency appeal in the Court 
of Claims in Lansing. When 
the Court of Claims declined 
Amadeo’s request to file the 
claim 
electronically, 
the 
attorneys drove to Lansing to 
file it in person.

Approximately 
50 
people 
gathered in the Vandenberg 
Room at the Michigan League 
Saturday to discuss the ongoing 
role Hinduism plays in casteism 
both in India and abroad. The 
event, “Dismantling Casteism 
and Racism: A Symposium,” 
was organized by the Asian/
Pacific 
Islander 
American 
Studies Program and several 
other University of Michigan 
organizations in cooperation 
with the Michigan chapter of 
the Ambedkar Association of 
North America. 
The symposium aimed to 
celebrate and continue the 
work of B.R. Ambedkar, a Dalit 
Indian 
statesman 
famously 
known as the Architect of 
India’s Constitution. Dalits, 
otherwise 
known 
as 
the 
Untouchables, are considered 
excluded or at the lowest level 
of the Hindu caste system 
and 
face 
discrimination 
and violence in South Asian 
communities. 
Ambedkar 
sought to fight caste-based 
discrimination 
through 
activist and legal processes, 
becoming a leader for the 
movement in opposition to 
casteism. 
Manan 
Desai, 
assistant 
professor 
of 
Asian/Pacific 
Islander studies and American 
culture, moderated the panel, 
providing opening remarks on 
the importance of analyzing 
the complacency that gives 
rise to Hindu oppression of 
different ethnic groups. 
“For those of us who have 
historically 
enjoyed 
the 
privileges — the generational 
privilege approved of being 
the right color, or holding 
privileged caste and racial 
identities — it is an important 
time to consider what it truly 
means to commit to dismantling 
the institutionalized forms of 
oppression,” Desai said. “What 
are the harsh truths that we 

need 
to 
hear 
internalized 
and be mobilized by? While 
progressive-minded 
South 
Asians might challenge white 
supremacy, in what ways can 
they or we turn a blind eye to 
Hindu fundamentalism, which 
is responsible for the ongoing 
atrocities and lynchings of 
Dalits and Muslims?”
Desai introduced the panel’s 
first speaker, Kancha Ilaiah 
Shepherd, who is the current 
director of the study of social 
exclusion and inclusive policy 
at Maulana Azad National 
Urdu University in Hyderabad, 
India. 
Shepherd 
explained 
activists and South Asians in 
the United States influence 
protests and debates in India.
“It 
is 
very 
significant 
that in America, whatever 
happens makes news in India,” 
Shepherd said. “And whatever 
happens here impacts our lives 
on almost (a) daily basis. It is 
in this situation where India 
is going through a crisis with 
the coming of the most rapid 
anti-human forces in power. 
This battle has to carried to 
(a) logical end … therefore 
this conference is very, very 
important.”
Shepherd, 
a 
member 
of 
the Sudra caste, commented 
on 
Ambedkar’s 
legacy 
in 
supporting those like him who 
were members of a lower caste. 
He 
described 
Ambedkar’s 
philosophy 
that 
underlying 
beliefs in Hinduism support 
caste discrimination.
“Annihilation 
of 
caste, 
or 
destruction 
of 
caste, 
as Ambedkar said, is not 
possible without dismantling 
or destroying Hinduism as 
a religion … Hinduism does 
not reform, does not change 
because 
of 
the 
structural 
problems 
in 
the 
religion,” 
Shepherd said.
These problems, as Shepherd 
argued, 
include 
Hinduism’s 
theory of the origin of human 
existence. 
He 
described 
Buddhism and Christianity as 

religions that both function 
as a “spiritual democracy” in 
which divine forces create 
all humans indiscriminately. 
Hinduism, Shepherd claims, is 
a system of “spiritual fascism” 
inasmuch as it alleges God 
only 
created 
Indians 
and 
created each caste from a 
different part of the human 
body, establishing a system 
of inequality inherent to the 
religion.
Shepherd 
continued 
his 
criticism 
of 
Hinduism 
by 
arguing 
other 
countries 
prospered 
because 
“dignity 
of 
labor” 
was 
integral 
to 
their religions. He described 
how Brahmins — considered 
high caste citizens — lack 
this sentiment and enjoy the 
production of other castes.
“Brahmins never worked in 
the field in production from 
childhood onwards,” Shepherd 
said. “But they consume the 
best food. They drink the milk 
of both cows and buffalos and 
abuse buffalo and bison … 
therefore Ambedkar said, ‘All 
this philosophy needs to be 
rooted out.’ Then caste begins 
to dismantle.” 
The 
symposium 
featured 
four 
other 
speakers, 
including activist Thenmozhi 
Soundararajan and three other 
speakers from universities in 
the United States. 
Rackham student Shalmali 
Jadhav came to the event 
because her research centers 
upon the intersection of racism 
and casteism, and Desai, one of 
the organizers, is her adviser. 
Jadhav expressed appreciation 
for the decision to include both 
a researcher and a professor in 
the discussion.
“I think it’s always really 
important for researchers and 
activists to be in conversation 
so that researchers can provide 
the kind of frameworks that 
activists need and also figure 
out how to make their research 
relevant to the ground reality,” 
Jadhav said.

ALICE LIN | COLUMN

Don’t use my race to further your agenda
W

hen I first heard 
about the lawsuit 
against 
Harvard 
University’s 
admissions 
process 
for 
discriminating 
against 
Asian-American 
applicants, I was a high 
school 
senior 
applying 
to 
college. 
I 
was 
beginning 
to 
understand 
the 
debate 
regarding affirmative action 
and how it could potentially 
impact my own admissions 
results. From a discussion 
about this in my government 
class, my understanding was 
that affirmative action was 
created to ensure equality of 
opportunity for students who 
come from underprivileged 
backgrounds. 
The 
whole 
point is that instead of setting 
quotas — which is illegal 
— colleges are still able to 
use race as a factor when 
considering applications. 
The lawsuit claims that 
Harvard’s affirmative action 
works negatively for Asian-
Americans by focusing their 
efforts to be more inclusive 
towards non-Asian-American 
minorities. It was recently 
decided that Harvard did 
not 
discriminate 
in 
its 
consideration of applications 
from Asian-Americans, which 
raises concerns about where 
affirmative action is going to 
end up if the case is appealed 
to the Supreme Court. Since 
the court currently has a 
conservative 
majority, 
the 
case 
might 
result 
in 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
entire 
practice, which would be a 
setback towards equality for 
underprivileged students. On 
the surface, it may seem like a 
win for Asian-Americans if the 
initial verdict is overruled, but 
at a closer look, the students 
who are suing are really 
being used as pawns to help 
dismantle an entire system 
that was created to give those 
who are more underprivileged 
a chance. 
The 
problem 
with 
the 
Harvard lawsuit is the person 
who is heading the protest 
against 
the 
admissions 
process is a white man. If 
the case does end up at the 
Supreme Court, it would not 
benefit 
Asian-Americans 
and 
other 
minorities, 
but 
rather white students. The 
purpose of affirmative action 
is to help support minority 
groups 
obtain 
the 
same 
opportunities 
that 
white 
students have, due to the 
disparity 
in 
socioeconomic 
privilege. If we dismantle 
this practice, this would not 
only perpetuate the system of 
white privilege but also make 
it immensely harder for non-

white students to advance in 
society. Furthermore, it would 
be much easier for colleges 
to be able to discriminate 
when considering applicants, 
which would limit diversity 
at 
these 
institutions 
of 
higher education. It is also 
just outright insensitive and 
close-minded if we do not 
acknowledge how privilege 
and race have a role in 
influencing 
the 
ability 
of 
students to perform. I’m also 
not sure if a white man is 
the best representative for 
Asian-American voices when 
it comes to such a racially 
charged issue; it feels like 
this case is being exploited 
so an outcome that would 
benefit 
more 
privileged 
students at the expense of 
more disadvantaged groups 
can be reached. Regardless of 
the intention here, this is an 
issue that affects minorities 
the most and should not be 
forgotten.

Affirmative 
action 
has 
become 
a 
complicated 
subject, since past court cases 
against it argue that it holds 
students of color to less harsh 
academic 
standards. 
The 
precedent set by these cases 
argues that white students 
are 
hurt 
by 
affirmative 
action because it appears as if 
minority students do not need 
to work as hard or that the 
spots of white students are 
given away to create artificial 
diversity. At the same time, 
Asian-Americans 
are 
hurt 
by affirmative action despite 
being a minority, because 
they tend to perform well 
academically. There are a 
lot of problems with the way 
that race is considered in the 
pursuit of “creating” diversity 
and 
Asian-Americans 
are 
constantly overlooked. They 
are constantly seen as a 
model 
minority, 
meaning 
that 
despite 
all 
of 
the 
disadvantages 
that 
come 
with not being white, they 
are still able to overcome 
discrimination and prejudice 
to succeed and rise. 
This 
perspective 
is 
problematic and completely 
wrong; as someone who comes 

from 
an 
Asian-American 
background and community, 
the idea of success through 
hard work is deeply ingrained 
into the culture. Children 
face a lot of pressure from 
their 
parents 
to 
achieve 
certain expectations, and it 
is due to parental sacrifices 
and priorities that Asian-
American children are turned 
into hard working machines. 
The 
model 
minority 
stereotype 
only 
reinforces 
the racial divide between 
minorities 
and 
instead 
perpetuates 
discrimination 
when it comes to programs like 
affirmative action. The lack 
of racial privilege that Asian-
Americans have compared to 
white students should not be 
forgotten; just because the 
mindset of hard work that 
exists in Asian culture pushes 
Asian-American children to 
perform at a certain standard 
does not automatically mean 
that they are less racially 
disadvantaged. On the other 
hand, one minority group’s 
success should not set a 
precedent 
or 
expectations 
for another. We should strive 
to remember that privilege 
exists and varies on all levels. 
There is a need to promote 
equality 
and 
ensure 
that 
those who begin in more 
disadvantageous 
situations 
are given the opportunity to 
succeed.
Affirmative action is not 
the problem here. Sure, it is 
not the perfect solution to 
tackling the larger issue of 
socioeconomic 
inequality 
and 
racial 
privilege, 
but 
we should not attempt to 
dismantle it. It has been ruled 
that affirmative action does 
not hurt white students, so 
we need to focus on changing 
the 
inequalities 
that 
are 
deeply 
ingrained 
in 
our 
society. Rather, the system 
can be improved upon, so it 
does not hurt the groups it 
was designed to help. Invest 
more 
in 
public 
primary 
education or create programs 
to encourage and lift less-
privileged students to the 
same level of opportunity. 
Don’t 
pit 
students 
who 
are 
already 
disadvantaged 
against each other at the 
benefit of a group that has 
more privilege to begin with. 
Instead, focus on ensuring 
that everyone has the same 
opportunity 
regardless 
so that we eventually will 
have no need to implement 
programs that force diversity 
to be created.

The wealth tax: an ineffective and dangerous measure
F

or many, taxes have 
always been a dreaded 
and inevitable fact of 
life. 
Considering 
the 
sheer 
complexity of the system and 
the stress that often comes 
with sending the check off to 
the government, paying taxes 
— while being essential to the 
well-being of our society — is 
ultimately difficult at times.
But 
amid 
the 
divisive 
2020 presidential race, the 
more liberal members of the 
Democratic field — notably Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass., 
and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — 
have proposed a dramatic new 
measure dubbed the “Wealth 
Tax.” This proposal would 
bring our government even 
more tax revenue, trillions of 
dollars more, as the proposals 
have outlined.
While 
our 
federal 
government 
has 
generally 
taxed income and property, 
among 
other 
common 
and 
current sources of tax revenue, 
the wealth tax would be a new 
measure never before enacted 
in the United States. Differing 
heavily 
from 
present-day 
methods of taxation, the wealth 
tax would target only the top 
0.1 
percent 
of 
Americans, 
taking a considerable chunk 
of 
those 
taxpayers’ 
total 
income 
each 
year. 
Under 
Warren’s more modest, though 
nonetheless worrisome plan, 
the government would collect 
nearly $3 trillion over a 10 
year period from this measure, 
while Sanders’ more ambitious 
actions would produce even 
more, cutting the wealth of 
billionaires in half over a 15 
year period, as stated on his 
website
The truth is, what Warren 
and Sanders are addressing is a 
serious issue in our nation, with 
real and concerning economic 
and 
societal 
implications. 
Income inequality continues to 
deepen; with the top 1 percent 
of Americans holding nearly 
40 percent of total wealth, and 
the bottom 90 percent holding 
only about a quarter, according 
to research published in a May 
2019 Business Insider article. 

A wealth tax would in theory 
work against this destructive 
inequality, taking from the 
top of the top and lifting up 
the rest of American society 
through beneficial programs. 
As theorized by the Institute 
on Taxation and Economic 
Policy, the measure “would 
raise revenue to make public 
investments and curb growing 
inequality among Americans.”
However, while millions of 
Americans 
are 
undoubtedly 
suffering 
disproportionately 
compared to the top income-
earners, the wealth tax is 
ultimately 
not 
the 
answer. 
Many 
in 
this 
nation 
may 
support enacting it, as recent 
data suggests, but this seems 
to 
come 
from 
a 
common, 
unwarranted sense of unity 
against 
the 
wealthiest 
taxpayers. 
The staggering divide is 
surely disturbing, but it doesn’t 
justify going after the top 0.1 
percent. On the contrary, this 
wealthy taxbase is one of the 
powerhouses of our economy, 
serving as a significant source 
of investment that works to 
stimulate economic activity and 
benefit all. Forcing billionaires 
and others to hand over large 
portions of their net worths 
would surely reduce business 
investment, 
consequently 
slowing 
our 
economy 
and 
hurting everybody.
“You’re going to completely 
disincentivize 
capital 
investment, which is going to 
be very, very bad for economic 
growth,” Treasury Secretary 
Steven 
Mnuchin 
said 
to 
the New York Times in an 
interview from September. In 
the end, what Warren, Sanders 
and 
others 
are 
proposing 
would directly cut off one of 
the greatest stimulants in our 
economic system. 
Furthermore, 
the 
wealth 
tax 
would 
rapidly 
punish 
the innovation and audacity 
that have fostered such great 
advances in our country. Why 
would 
a 
wealthy 
business 
owner set out to invent and 
sell a revolutionary product if 
they knew that they could one 

day be penalized for making 
significant profits? Under a 
wealth tax, there would be 
fewer incentives to produce 
and improve on many of the 
technological 
leaps 
of 
our 
lifetimes for fear of getting 
significantly wealthy, only to 
have a sizable chunk of these 
earnings taken away. There 
are few entrepreneurs who 
would one day want to see as 
much as half of their wealth 
taken from them by our federal 
government. The wealth tax is 
really an un-American measure 
disguised as a beneficial one 
that will work to undermine 
the spirit of hard work that 
defines 
our 
respected 
free 
market economy.
And moreover, the tax is 
not the necessity that Warren 
and Sanders market it as. 
Proponents claim that we need 
the additional revenue, but 
there is great evidence that 
the federal government has 
mismanaged its current tax 
revenue for years. For the war 
on terror, a widely criticized 
effort, our federal government 
spent nearly $2.5 trillion, an 
amount that could have likely 
been 
significantly 
reduced 
with better leadership. There 
is far too much fraud, waste 
and misallocation of resources 
in our government’s current 
operations to consider pumping 
even more revenue into the 
system. We all would be much 
better off supporting a dramatic 
restructuring of our leaders’ 
current spending habits before 
we attempt to weaken one of 
the key drivers of our economy. 
Without a doubt, we have 
much work to do to address 
the 
disturbing 
income 
inequality 
rampant 
in 
our 
society, something we have 
unfortunately grappled with 
for generations. But in a nation 
that has often been admired 
for its great inventiveness, we 
surely have the power in us to 
tackle our problems without 
killing that same spirit of 
innovation in the process.

I

f you’ve been paying any 
attention to things the 
past couple years, it can 
seem like the world is going 
mad. The Amazon rainforest 
is 
burning, 
the 
president 
is using Twitter to defend 
himself against impeachment, 
the U.K. is imploding from 
the pressure of Brexit and 
Hong Kong is embroiled in 
a fight for its democracy, 
among many other prominent 
struggles. It’s hard to keep up 
with it all. But in the chaos 
of the modern era, there’s a 
dangerous and demonstrable 
trend 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
popping up. 
In places all around the 
world, fascist demagogues 
are coming to power. In 
Poland, the institutions that 
preside are facing a battle 
with PiS (Law and Justice 
Party), a nationalistic party 
that prides itself on anti-
immigrant and anti-LGBTQ 
rhetoric. In the Philippines 
there is President Rodrigo 
Duterte, 
a 
leader 
who 
outright kills drug dealers. In 
India we have Prime Minister 
Narenda 
Modi, 
who 
uses 
Islamophobia in the Hindu 
populace to inspire support 
and 
congregate 
power 
in 
the 
executive 
branch. 
In 
Brazil 
there’s 
 
President 
Jair Bolsonaro, a man who 
fetishizes 
the 
military 
dictatorship that ruled Brazil 
from the mid-1960s to the 
1980s. And of course, we 
have Trump, who stirs up 
the divisions of this country 
and strips the press of its 
credibility 
through 
“fake 
news” 
gaslighting. 
Right-
wing populism is on the rise, 
and you should be scared. 
Let’s first focus on PiS 
(Prawo i Sprawiedliwo´s´c) in 
Poland. PiS is a right-wing, 
nationalistic party that first 
came to power in 2015 in the 
wake of Donald Tusk leaving 
Poland to become President 
of 
the 
European Council.
The party prides itself on a 
rhetoric of anti-LGBTQ and 

anti-immigrant 
sentiments, 
with 
typical 
nationalist 
slogans including (but not 
limited 
to) 
“refugees 
get 
out” and “pure Poland, white 
Poland.” Since PiS came to 
power, the country has been 
in a crisis of rolling back 
constitutional rights, with the 
party gaining more and more 
control over the government. 
PiS almost passed a law that 
would 
require 
judges 
to 
retire based on age, which 
would 
almost 
immediately 
relinquish 24 out of the 76 
seats on the Polish Supreme 
Court. The law would have 
expanded the court to 120 
judges as well, which would 
give PiS immediate control 
over two-thirds of the court 
by means of the president 
appointing judges who would 
follow 
the 
party’s 
whim. 
This congregation of power 
within the ruling party is 
a guaranteed way to get 
oppressive decrees against 
marginalized groups. 
Another example can be 
seen in the large democracy 
of 
Brazil. 
Jair 
Bolsonaro 
was 
elected 
president 
in 
late 2018 and took power on 
January 1 this year. Some of 
Jair’s rhetoric includes anti-
LGBTQ, sexism and racism. 
Conventions too familiar for 
comfort. Bolsonaro has been 
quoted saying that criminals 
“should die on the street like 
cockroaches,” and is noted 
as wanting to rid his country 
of “lefties” and communists. 
And he’s gone on record in 
support of President Donald 
Trump. By the way, Bolsonaro 
is selling hundreds of miles 
of the Amazon rainforest to 
loggers and farmers. It’s one 
of the reasons the forest is 
burning up right now. 
In 
the 
world’s 
largest 
democracy 
— 
India 
— 
a 
populist leader was elected 
on the back of Islamophobia 
and nationalism. India finds 
itself embroiled in a decade 
long rivalry with Pakistan 
and is incredibly vulnerable 

to such toxic campaigning. 
Islamic 
immigrants 
from 
places like Bangladesh have 
been labeled as “termites” 
and wretches of society by 
members of Modi’s party. 
After Modi’s first election, 
lynch mobs against Muslims 
cropped 
up, 
and 
those 
inciting them got away with 
their extrajudicial killings. 
Unfortunately, India is falling 
victim to the nationalist wave 
many in the Western world 
are succumbing to as well.
The commonality between 
all of these different instances 
can be found within the gripes 
of the people: a failing system 
with forces acting in bad faith 
manipulating the affected. 
A corrupt government left 
a power vacuum in Brazil 
once they were found out; 
Polish 
right-wing 
actors 
blamed unrelated problems 
on 
the 
emerging 
migrant 
crisis; a nation consisting of 
0.1 percent Muslim people 
(38,000) fell to Islamophobic 
fervor; a nation still recovering 
from the economic crash of 
2008 and faced with a more 
powerful China is blaming its 
economic woes on Mexican 
immigrants who are fleeing 
their own country at the 
behest of wealthy legislators. 
Unchecked 
rhetoric 
can 
become a malignant movement 
of far-right extremity. What 
we can take from this here in 
the United States is a reflection 
of how similar movements can 
take hold, with an emboldening 
far right taking advantage of 
the political turmoil in the 
Trump era. Keep tabs on the 
rhetoric being thrown around 
in discourse, and don’t be 
swayed in your thinking by 
demagogues who prey on 
your fear. Speak up against 
bad 
faith 
actors 
putting 
the blame on marginalized 
people 
and 
demonstrate 
against injustice. Don’t let 
your country fall to fascism.

How many times have you been to Hill 
Auditorium? Would you be able to pinpoint 
on a map where it is? What it’s primarily 
used for? If you struggled to answer any of 
these questions, you’re not alone. Oftentimes, 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
don’t 
experience all the performances Michigan 
has to offer. The numerous opportunities to 
see the profound talent that lies within the 
city of Ann Arbor can feel overwhelming. 
There are so many websites to look at, so 
many brochures to open up, links to follow 
and people to network with. However, thanks 
to the University Musical Society (UMS) 
Student Committee, events such as the Hill 
Auditorium Open House allow students 
to explore the various offerings at the 
University. 
The Hill Auditorium Open House will 
feature a free tour of Hill Auditorium, as well 
as the opportunity to explore some areas that 
only performers have access to. Students will 
have the chance to learn about the historical 
significance of Hill Auditorium and discover 
what famous musicians and performing 
artists have been featured on its stage. The 
Open House will also feature information 
regarding upcoming UMS performances and 
other opportunities. 
I had the opportunity to sit down with 
the two co-presidents of the UMS Student 
Committee, School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance senior Jamie Sharp and LSA senior 
Jacob Gibson. The two planned the event in 
hopes that it would bring more attention to 
the opportunities UMS provides for students 

across campus. 
“A lot of students don’t even know that we 
have Bert’s tickets, which allow freshmen 
or sophomores at the University to see UMS 
events for free,” said Sharp. Bert’s tickets 
give every student at the University a free 
ticket to a UMS show. Sharp and Gibson are 
both passionate about student accessibility 
to arts. The primary function of the student 
committee is to allow students to be informed 
of these types of opportunities.
“The Hill event in particular is a way 
to bring students to a space that is on their 
campus, one that they likely walk by every 
day, but they may not have had a chance to 
see a performance there or be on the stage,” 
said Gibson. Oftentimes, the only students 
with an opportunity to set foot on the stage 
of Hill Auditorium are the students who 
perform there. This event gives those that 
perhaps would never get another opportunity 
to experience what it is like to perform on the 
stage a chance to see it first hand. 
“I have performed in there for the past 
three years, and in preparation for the event 
I am learning so much about the space that I 
honestly didn’t even know,” Sharp said about 
the rich history of Hill Auditorium. The Open 
House is a perfect opportunity for students to 
be informed of its history as well as to take 
a moment to appreciate the gift that this 
auditorium is for the University. 
Even if you are not able to attend the Open 
House on Friday, Oct. 18, I encourage you to 
further explore not only UMS, but the other 
performance outlets and venues available 
to the students on campus. We only have a 
few years of our life to spend at University, 
why not take advantage of all the glorious 
resources it has to offer?

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

For years, the American music competition show has 
been a staple genre in television. It’s reliable — it’s always 
the same sad stories, the same person covering “Firework” 
by Katy Perry, and the same person that thinks they’re 
gonna change up the music industry. You’ll find the same 
reliability in Netflix’s first rap music competition, “Rhythm 
+ Flow.” It’s a refreshing new take on music competition 
shows like “American Idol” and “The Voice,” streamlined 
into the hip hop genre. It’s necessary; nobody ever really 
auditions to these classic competitions through rap or hip 
hop, and when they do, they rarely ever make it that far. 
“Rhythm + Flow” keeps it authentic, using rap industry 
icons Cardi B, Chance the Rapper and T.I. to judge the 
contestants. The main judges band together in the first 
round of auditions in Los Angeles along with guest judge, 
Snoop Dogg to kick off the show, then break apart to go 
to their native cities to find the next rap icon. When they 
break apart to find worthy contestants in their native cities 
in the later episodes, it feels a bit like the family’s broken 
apart, and it never feels like the guest judges have much of 
a say in the decisions of who gets to move on or not. Had the 
main judges stayed together and rotated the guest judges 
out, they could have brought similar and reliable chemistry 
to each episode. After all, the audience sticks around for 
the Simon Cowell, not for the rotating-out Luke Bryan. 
Familiar music competition tropes are followed, but the 
focus on hip hop allows us to see contestants with different 
backgrounds and origin stories than your average suburban 

pop star. This ensures that the sob stories and contestant 
motivations aren’t regurgitated from typical competitions, 
and we get to see another side to the music industry. The 
tears are limited and don’t seem overdone, and it’s just 
enough to attach the audience to these individuals and 
their stories. But like Cardi B mentions, everyone in the 
industry is going to have a sob story — it’s about who can 
redirect it into their music and sell records with it. 
Its intentions are different than other music 
competition shows out there. They’re not looking for the 
next “American Idol” — they made it clear in the beginning 
that they were looking for someone with star quality who 
can collaborate with other rap artists to make money and 
get signed to record labels to turn a profit. They don’t 
bullshit the purpose of music competitions like some 
others do. The judges know that the contestants are there 
to start their career, not win an ephemeral competition. It 
feels directed toward a purpose, like the judges are really 
there to support the up and coming music artists of the rap 
industry.
However, like all competition shows, “Rhythm + Flow” 
also has a tendency to drag on. Especially without the 
presence of all the main judges in each episode, episodes 
featuring dry guest judges make the critiques bland and 
repetitive, and it often feels like the main judge is holding 
up the ship on their own. That being said, the stories and 
relatability of some of the contestants makes it easy to get 
attached and root for the people you believe in. If they 
push together the main judges further on into the season 
and figure out how to separate themselves from average 
music competitions a little bit more, “Rhythm + Flow” can 
jumpstart several careers and have a good Netflix run.

‘Rhythm’ is an alright reboot

TV REVIEW

“The Forest of Love,” directed by Sion Sono 
(“Why Don’t You Play in Hell?”), follows the hazy 
adventures of a group of young filmmakers, a 
slick con man and two girls with dark high school 
memories. The film is highly experimental without 
a close reference in genre or style, but the closest 
that comes to mind is “Mulholland Drive.” The 
two movies share a similarly fragmented narrative 
structure and gauzy harshness to their aesthetic, 
but differ vastly in their atmospheres.
A 
major 
strength 
of 
“Forest” 
is 
its 
characters. 
Each 
of 
them bursts with life, 
from Shin (Shinnosuke 
Mitsushima, 
“Kingdom”), a loner 
who finds his passion 
in 
Tokyo 
when 
approached by a pair 
of aspiring filmmakers, 
to Mitsuko (newcomer Eri Kamataki), a mysterious 
recluse struggling to overcome the ghosts of her 
past. As zany as the movie eventually becomes, 
the audience’s connection to these characters is 
ultimately what keeps “Forest” afloat.
The film’s first 90 minutes are especially 
compelling, powerfully juxtaposing the themes 
of buried sexual anxiety and zealous adolescent 
spontaneity. The screenplay is easy to follow but 
never predictable, riding the line between the 
genres of comedy, horror, romance and thriller 
without cost to its vibrant characters. “Forest” 
makes an interesting point about the fantastical 
gravity of filmmaking, comparing it to a kind of 
superpower through which to see the world. The 
lens of a camera can be an enlightening way to 
capture the entire world and to garner praise (for 
Shin and his friends, this means winning at a local 
film festival). Of course, that superpower has its 
consequences too; when placed in the hands of the 
lonely, sexually depraved schoolboys, it becomes 

a tool of exploitation rather than exploration. The 
divide between those two outcomes of filmmaking 
is characteristic not only of the movie that Shin 
creates, but of “Forest” itself.
Where the movie loses the cogency of its ideas is 
in its absurd, macabre final hour. Though he hangs 
over the story in vignettes and flashbacks, the 
permanent entrance of conman Joe Murata (Kippei 
Shina, “Hand of God”) irreversibly transforms 
“Forest” into psychological horror. He clutches onto 
the film’s intimate revelations, its haloed innocence 
and burns them to the ground with a nihilism that is 
more than shocking — it’s assaulting. The contrast 
is stark and uncomfortable, exchanging the film’s 
slow treatment of a few 
ideas to the intense, 
unforgiving focus of 
just a few. 
While this violent, 
stomach-churning 
segment of the “Forest” 
is sure to turn off some 
viewers, I found it a 
remarkable example of 
how far a director can 
both sharpen and discard the rules of a story, so 
unbound to logic or his viewers that each new turn 
the film takes is as affecting as the last. In other 
words, the filmmakers begin to fall into the lunacy 
of their characters, an idea that ultimately consumes 
“Forest” behind and in front of the camera. To 
experience that downward hedonic spiral of isn’t 
necessarily enjoyable or entertaining, but it shook 
me to my core in a way that few films ever have. In 
sacrificing the wit and tangible message of the ideas 
it initially presented, “Forest” forces viewers into 
the tattered psyche of its own director. 
To say I’ve never seen anything like “Forest” is not 
completely accurate. I’ve never seen anything that 
even approximates the clawing, bruising torment 
of this film. That realization was both exciting as 
it was frightening during the movie, but I finished 
it feeling more enlightened than anything else. For 
those looking to expand the limits of their movie 
watching, “Forest” is the perfect pick, especially for 
October.

The enigma of the ‘Forest’

ANISH TAMHANEY
Daily Arts Writer

It’s October in Michigan. The pale, mossy-
colored fields lined with skinny trees in tangled 
rows. Scarlet dotting the wild leaves, peeking out 
like a secret. The air is light and sharp, the chill 
nestled in between the knits of your sweater. 
The surrounding trees are ablaze in bonfire 
shades. Donut in one hand, cider in the other. 
For Michiganders, October is not a month — it’s 
a tradition. October isn’t understood in days or 
events. It’s understood in memories. All of the dirt 
roads and trails that lead through the tumbling 
October airs of yesterday lead Michiganders to 
one place: orchards.
Apples decorate the bushels of my memory. 
My father worked on an apple orchard when I 
was a kid. My childhood is filled with the faint 
recollections of trees and pumpkins. Scattered 
around in my head is hay and cinnamon. Haunted 
hayrides and canvas bags full of apples — these are 
the things that made me. Each October brings with 
it the sweet scent of Gala or Ambrosia. Without 
them, I don’t imagine I would be the same. I don’t 
imagine Michigan would be the same, either.
My father worked at Miller’s Big Red, an 
orchard that’s been resting on a sprawling 90 
acres of Washington, MI land since around since 
1876. He used to take me to work with him, letting 
me ride on the back of the tractor or follow him 
around while he tended to the trees. He let me try 
the cider he would make, or pick apples down off 
branches for me. In many ways, I was raised on 
orchards.
Michigan is the third-largest producer of apples 

in the country. It produces, by far, the most apples 
in the Midwest. With over 11 million trees across 
825 family farms, the Mitten is an autumnal 
cornucopia. Michigan’s orchards rest in a palm 
of plenty, cradled in the insulating embrace of the 
Great Lakes. Please try Blake Farms in Armada. 
They’ve been providing pomaceous delights to 
Macomb County since 1946. Or perhaps Franklin 
Cider Mill in Bloomfield Hills. It’s an old-style 
cider mill in a wooden-building where they press 
their own apples. A creek runs through it. If 
you don’t go there for the cider, you ought to go 
for the beauty. Maybe Dexter Cider Mill is more 
your taste, with its honored spot as the oldest 
continually operating orchard, operating along 
the Huron River.
Pies and fritters. Cider and donuts. Turn 
the fruit into butter or pick them right off the 
tree and eat them. Apples make autumn worth 
experiencing. For some, apples symbolize the fall 
of man. For Michigan, it’s the last beautiful thing 
we get all year. It’s our most valuable fruit crop. It 
feeds our deer. It’s the treat we get for making it 
through a whole year.
Whether you’re in Michigan for a lifetime or 
a moment, it’ll stay with you. You don’t have to 
be born and raised here to be one of us. You’re 
a Michigander so long as you love this place. If 
you’ve made it through a whole year in Michigan, 
you’ve earned an October. Go to an orchard. 
Pick an apple. Scoop up a pumpkin. Drink some 
cider. Make Michigan your own by making 
some Michigan memories. When you bite into 
a honeycrisp that you just picked off a tree, with 
the chill of an October gust hugging you under the 
arms, you’ll know where you belong. You deserve 
it. Welcome home.

Home is where the heart
and the Honeycrisps are

The streets of Ann Arbor are peppered by about 1.45 million 
trees. Elm, ash and honeylocust line the sidewalks and fill up 
the spaces between the buildings. Each one makes living in 
Ann Arbor that much more pleasant. Now, imagine if an over-
caffeinated Literature student summoned one of the many 
ashy-barked birches in the Arb to life to stalk and strangle their 
enemies. This is the kind of existential questioning Facebook’s 
newest show, “The Birch,” asks of its viewers.
“The Birch” follows the interwoven stories of three high 
schoolers in a sleepy Oregon town. Evie Grayson (Xaria Dotson, 
“American Vandal”) is a purple-haired loner who longs for her 
deceased mother. Thurston Polk (Dempsey Bryk, “The Silence”) 
is a drug dealer with a heart of gold who manages to get tangled 
up in a murder. Lanie Bouchard (Midori Francis, “Good Boys”) 
gives birth to a baby girl who will ultimately be raised as her 
sister to protect her father’s political career. The thread that 
connects them is the Birch: A chaotic tree spirit with a maternal 
sensibility who can be summoned for malevolent and violent 
protection.
Evie accidentally catches Thurston and two of his more 
delinquent acquaintances standing over a dead body. Then, 
they catch Evie spying. Thurston’s associates ensure that Evie 
won’t talk by inflicting a small amount of pain. But when one 
terrorizes Evie more than he ought to have, Evie accidentally 
summons the Birch, who takes care of the boy.
As a show, “The Birch” is based on a 2016 horror short with 
a similar premise. Each episode is a quick 15 minutes, but the 
plot manages to move very slow. Facebook Watch released three 
episodes of the 15-episode series, but not much plot manages 
to find its way into those three episodes. The show is partially 
suffering due to its format, but it’s also suffering due to poor 
writing. We’ve received slim, quick biographies about each 
character and we know they’re all connected. But that’s mostly 
it. It took three episodes for the Birch to be summoned, and a 
key part of its mythology has been left out so far.
Part of what makes the Birch such a thorny antagonist is 

that its services are not free. Summoning the Birch — and it 
killing someone on your behalf — comes at a price. The idea is 
that the amount of pain it inflicts on others and gives to you 
will be equal. Which can be a very terrifying concept. Yet, the 
show hasn’t sold itself on that yet. Too much is given away, not 
enough is hidden. The monster is in plain sight, which only 
draws attention to the fact that the true horror is the show’s 
stunted, messy plot.
A mother’s love never dies. This can make the mothers of 
horror quite intimidating and terrifying. Consider Guillermo 
del Toro’s “Mama,” a film that, while not the best, was certainly 
fun for all its shape-shifting and affectionate terrorizing. Yet, 
that fun and terror seems to be missing from “The Birch” thus 
far. 
What the writers have is incredibly rich material, even if it 
might not seem like it. The monster is akin to a maternal demon. 
It’s a play on eco-horror, invoking the very plants that help give 
this world life. The plot points are very basic, allowing for a lot 
of room to play with the what’s revealed. But, it still misses the 
mark. It doesn’t know how to pace itself, things are given away 
almost immediately, and it isn’t even particularly scary. That’s to 
say nothing of the dialogue, which doesn’t really inspire a whole 
lot of emotions. “The Birch” probably never will be incredible. 
I’m not sure it’s meant to be. It could at least be fun. We have 12 
more episodes to see whether or not it can deliver.

‘The Birch’ is menacing, but stunted

In the acknowledgements section of her third novel, “Dominicana,” Angie Cruz writes that the 
novel is inspired by her mother’s story of immigration. Cruz writes: “...she said, who would be 
interested in a story about a woman like me? It’s so typical.”
“Dominicana” is a portrait of the 15-year-old Ana Canción, who is from the countryside town of 
Los Guayacanes in the Dominican Republic. She is married off to Juan Ruiz, a man twice her age, 
and resettles in New York City with the expectation of bringing her mother and siblings after an 
interval. This plan is complicated when the abusive Juan moves back to the Dominican Republic 
to protect his restaurant during a civil war. Ana is left with his charming but flighty brother 
César, who is a completely different, supportive presence in her life and with whom she soon falls 
in love. Close to the middle of the novel, Ana is suddenly conflicted between her distaste for Juan 
and her love for César on one hand, and her obligations to her family on the other. 
In an essay on the Paris Review blog, Cruz details how her mother’s young marriage, the basis 
for the novel, is in a sense typical of the immigrant experience — parents make tough decisions 
for the sake of their children. “For many years, I vilified my grandmother for marrying off my 
mother, for not giving her a choice, for coercing her to sacrifice her body, desire, and liberty. She 
was just a child. But then I think my grandmother was trying to save her.” To be in Ana’s position 
means that no decision is merely personal — she has to think of her mother and her siblings as 
well. 
Ana’s predicament thus resembles a classic novelistic situation — many, many novels center 
around a love triangle that energizes a social milieu, makes its internal workings visible. 
“Dominicana” doesn’t quite work like this, though. It’s ultimately a novel where not much 
deviates from the expected course of affairs, a sense one reaches long before the plot with César 
emerges. Ana’s actions of resistance do not develop the 
plot, but have a quality of furtiveness, futility. After 
Juan chokes her, she decides to try to escape back home 
to her mother, anticipating the abuse she would endure 
upon arriving.
“On the table she’ll have laid out a plastic slipper, 
my father’s leather belt, a sack of uncooked rice, a 
ream from a tree, the fly swatter, and a wire hanger.” 
She is eventually stopped by César, whereafter she 
resigns herself to staying in New York. After another 
abusive episode, she tries to make Juan sick by feeding 
him a meal made from a pigeon she caught from 
her fire escape, which he “survives without even a 
stomachache.” 
The novel has a tendency to short circuit its narrative 
before it begins. What remains is, more often than not, 
minutiae: She cooks food for Juan and her few friends, 
she endures Juan’s abuse and the restrictions he places 
on her life, she tries to make money via odd jobs, she 
thinks absentmindedly about home. This is all done in 
scenic rather than expository writing — we are in the 
room for every routine preparation of a meal, for every 
time Juan comes home exhausted and drunk from 
work.
Several storylines move under the surface but fail to 
fully assert themselves above the noise of the everyday. Ana gives food to and tries to communicate 
with several elderly people in her building who seem to live on their own; Ana befriends a woman 
named Marisela who disappears one day; Ana starts a business selling Dominican food to workers 
at a textile factory. Each story doesn’t ever really pose as a serious contender for dominance over 
the central story of Ana’s endurance for the sake of her family. Even the plot with César, which 
most threatens to destabilize Ana’s tenuous hold on her situation, simply fizzes out toward the 
end of the novel without any real sense of closure or even change. It never comes into the open or 
forces anyone to confront anything. 
The plot of the novel is quiet, living more in gestures than arcs. Obligation asserts its hold 
everywhere in a way that is likely about as realistic as it gets for someone in Ana’s situation. 
Good writing can come out of this mold — the short stories of Yuko Tsushima come to mind — 
but it requires an attention to detail that isn’t exercised here. The prose style is clipped, with 

little in the way of sensory detail. The novel is built out of statements rather than emotions, 
emotion factual rather than sensual: “We walk back to the apartment, both too hungry to speak. 
He carries my bag. I loop my arm around his. The sun beams on us. The wind whips paper cups up 
from the corner garbage cans. I want to scream, sing, spin, laugh. I’m having a baby!”
It’s a kind of writing that is at times bright and 
pointillistic but doesn’t let a whole lot of internality 
through, even when it depicts pain or desire. It’s an odd 
choice for a story where not much out of the ordinary 
actually happens — the book is dry, brittle, factual. I 
didn’t feel like I was let into much of Ana’s world at all. 
More than anything, Cruz spoils a lot of the narrative 
for herself by her tendency to editorialize as things 
happen, clipping the narrative by essentially glossing 
its meaning. When César is arrested, Ana pauses at one 
point, like someone recalling something: “I hate you! 
I continue to scream. You don’t know what it’s like for 
us. How hard it is trying to survive in this big city. How 
many times César has been screwed, even if he always 
walks in a straight line.” Glosses like this tended to take 
me fully out of the narrative into Cruz’s attitude toward 
her subjects, one that is respectful but ultimately 
distant. 
Ultimately, it feels like Cruz is trying to do something 
with the form of the novel that it doesn’t naturally do 
well: stand in for a collective, “typical” experience. I’m 
reminded of Julie Otsuka’s novella “The Buddha In The 
Attic,” which is told from a collective we. Cruz’s title, 
as well as the voluminous research she underwent to 
write the novel, seems to indicate that she is trying to 
do something similar with one woman’s story. Otsuka’s novella works because the collective we 
can accommodate a great range of contradictory experiences. If a single character needs to stand 
in for a place, a time, or a people, she runs the risk of losing the ability to speak for herself. Ana’s 
character, in the end, feels less like a real person and more like a synecdoche.
She both has a saintly devotion to her family and a desire for freedom, and because she stands in 
for the Dominican-American experience writ large, this contradiction isn’t allowed to complicate 
matters. It feels like Ana’s desires are not her own but those of her potential readers, who Cruz 
imagines as white Americans. “Stories like my mother’s, although common, are rarely represented 
in the mainstream narratives available to us,” she writes in the acknowledgements. I’m starting 
to wonder whether the desire indexed by this statement might create a set of expectations that 
the form of the novel can’t fulfill.

The complex highs and lows of the love triangle in
‘Dominicana’ are riveting but feel somewhat regular

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 16, 2019

I 

haven’t always loved Ann Arbor — I don’t know 
if I love it right now. Its quintessential charm 
is lost upon me. But, there are things about it I 
have learned to love, most of all my late night walks 
across campus when the rest of the world is fast asleep. 
There is a certain beauty to walking around the build-
ings on campus when the air is crisp and cold. I listen 
to music on these walks, which gives me the preten-
tious feeling of walking in my own indie film. These 
silent spaces are the moments when I feel most alive. 
But there is an Ann Arbor I loved that no longer 
exists. So now, when I go on these walks, I am walk-
ing in the shadow of what once was. Next to me are 
the memories of my Ann Arbor. 
We often talk about grief as the uncontrollable 
disbelief of something gone, and we portray it as the 
tears that stain our faces. But I think Joan Didion was 
right when she wrote that when grief comes, it “is 
nothing like we expect it to be.” She says that grief is 
the tidal force that makes us reconcile with the axis 
of our being. 
Saying goodbye to Rin is the tide of grief that has 

crashed upon the shores of my Ann Arbor. I know that 
she is no longer on the fourth floor of North Quad. I 
know that she is no longer on the other end of a phone 
call. I know that, for me, she now only exists in my 
Ann Arbor: the Ann Arbor that was. 
Grief is the demand for attention, something that 
turns us on our sides, where North and South switch, 
a state of being where we are lost. It consumes our 
lives. Grief, is the momentary impossibility of form-
ing a future, because the past has too tight a hold on 
our present. 
I 

wrote Rin a letter before I left for Germany, 
while she was fast asleep next to me. I wrote 
in my big cursive letters, “I don’t know how it 
is that we lived next to each other for so many years, 
met at a random gathering for the French Club, and 
then ended up having to go to France to be friends. 
Whatever reason the universe delayed our beginning 
it doesn’t matter because we have now found each 
other.” Rin was my friend. Rin was my best friend in 
my Ann Arbor. 

S

eneca, the Roman philosopher once advised 
to really let the idea of a friendship sink in, in 
fact the word he used was ponder. “Ponder for 
a long time whether you shall admit a given person to 
your friendship.” However, the most important lesson 
Seneca leaves us with is, “but when you have decided 
to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and 
soul.” 
Losing Rin, the one I had welcomed into such inti-
mate spaces of my life, is my grief. Losing a friend is 
the hollowing of the heart, the misplacement of the 
being. Losing a friend is inevitable. We all we lose a 
beloved friend at one point or another, for any of a 
million reasons. 
M

y grief is the slow realization that the key 
of my Ann Arbor now lies in the impos-
sibility of a friendship that once was. It 
is knowing I will not hear her laughter. I will not feel 
annoyance at her persistent tardiness. It is knowing 
that my Ann Arbor is locked in the memories of what 
was. It is in this moment that I have begun my true 
mourning — for nothing can replace Rin. Nothing will 
come close to the beauty of shared memories, of trials 
endured together, of fights and reconciliations. My 
Ann Arbor sits idle in my mind. 
I 

promised Rin to hold her well. I hoped that all 
the parts that weighed in her mind were prov-
en light in my arms. I hoped that the love I held 
for her flowed into her soul. I hope she felt it when I 
was gone. I hope she feels it when she smells lavender. 
I hope she still feels it now: honest and imperfect. 
I thank Rin for her unnerving ability to love, and 
daring to see the good in everyone. I thank Rin for 
the many nights she picked up the phone when I 
called from Germany, for the nights I didn’t have the 
courage to hang up so she would let me fall asleep on 
the phone. I thank her for giving me the space that 
allowed me to safely remain myself. 
I hope Rin is out in the world living her truth. I 
hope we all can be a bit more like Rin. To embrace our 
capacity to love — hers was certainly powerful, warm, 
and rare. 
M

y heart breaks daily as I walk the streets 
of Ann Arbor. My heart breaks daily 
at the memory of my Ann Arbor. I have 
resented her absence in my life more than I could 
have ever imagined. I will forever be grateful to Rin. 
But more than anything, I hope that despite the hurt 
I have caused she still holds the key to her Ann Arbor. 
That she can still feel the love that was.

My Ann Arbor: Saying goodbye to Rin

BY MARTINA VILLALOBOS, STATEMENT COLUMNIST


M

y Friday nights are always 
the same: after grimacing 
through heavy deadlifts and 
squats, I hurry back to my room with 
a takeout box in hand. There’s always 
salmon, broccoli and brown rice, my 
three favorites (and a wonderful excuse 
to skip the ludicrously busy “daily 
special” line in the school cafeteria). 
Soon, my room is perfectly quiet 
except for the crunching of broccoli 
stems and the muffled breathing of my 
roommate, Margaret, who shares my 
appreciation of peace, quiet and early 
bedtimes. After the food is gone, I wipe 
off my table until I can’t see a single 
crumb, plug in my headphones, and 
queue “Columbo” on my computer. Yes, 
I not only share the domestic habits of 
a 1980s housewife, but her taste in TV 
shows as well. When I finally get tired 
of Peter Falk, I head to the communal 
shower and prepare for a squeaky-clean 
hour of reading a novel, before I slip off 
to sleep. The night repeats every week. 
For me, it’s a paradise. 
Unfortunately, it’s always about this 
time that the noise starts up down the 
hall. Every Friday night, I hear them 
through the walls — the other freshmen 
girls who occupy every inch of space 
in front of the bathroom mirror. They 
giggle and adjust their makeup and 
miniskirts, as I hold my bathroom urges 
until the last minute. Eventually, I brave 
the crowd at the mirror and sneak past 
them on my way to the stall to avoid any 
small talk. Admittedly, I admire their 
makeup skills, but I can’t imagine telling 
them so — especially when I’m in my 
Mickey Mouse pajamas. I often wonder 
if the sound of me flushing the toilet 
will be buried among their freshman 
memories. 
O

ne Friday last spring, right 
when 
I 
was 
chewing 
my 
broccoli as usual, a hint of 
perfume slipped into my nose. I turned 
my head and miraculously discovered 
Margaret putting on eyeshadow. As she 
reached for the zipper on her fabulous 
dress, she murmured that she wouldn’t 
be back until midnight. I stared at her 
and nodded. Her heels clicketey-clacked 
as she walked out of the room. She 
closed the door right in front of my eyes, 
and sitting there in my Mickey Mouse 
pajamas, in my salmon and broccoli-
smelling room, I immediately reached to 
open the window. For some inexplicable 
reason, the scent was suffocating. 
As I was preparing to shut the blinds 
entirely, I caught sight of Margaret 
through the window. In the darkness, 
the sequins on her dress reflected 
the moonlight. I returned to my desk. 
Weirdly, I’d lost the desire to watch 
“Columbo” that night. What happened 
to my sweet, quiet roommate? It made 

no sense. 
Like me, Margaret never 
deviates from her nightly 
schedule of giggling softly 
at Saturday Night Live, 
then going to bed at 9:30 
p.m. sharp. What could she 
possibly be doing? What 
was she possibly doing in 
such a dress? How was 
she even comfortable in 
that V-neck? At that very 
moment, the silence in my 
room was stifling. I was 
absolutely embarrassed. 
The 
following 
day, 
I 
still 
couldn’t 
help 
but 
think 
about 
Margaret 
while catching my breath 
after squats. It was then, 
however, that an unfamiliar 
voice broke my train of 
thought: “Ummm, excuse 
me, hey, but … aren’t you 
Ivy?” 
Turning 
around, 
I saw the guy who I’d 
nicknamed “Under Armour 
T-shirt.” He must have had 
a routine too, because he 
was always there at the 
same time as me. “I have 
to admit, it’s not often we 
get girls in here who make 
me look weak, haha.” His 
laugh was awkward, but it 
was cute. “I’m Jeff! By any 
chance would you like to grab 
some food … When you’re done?” With 14 
more squat repetitions to go, the correct 
answer have been: “Hey man, leave me 
alone.” Yet strangely, in that moment, 
Margaret popped into my mind, and 
suddenly the idea of eating salmon and 
broccoli, alone, sounded terrible. 
“Umm, actually, OK. Yes. Sure.”
The task of eating and talking at the 
same time was so unfamiliar that I took 
twice as long as Jeff to finish my meal. 
“I have to tell you,” Jeff said while 
curling his spaghetti. “I never thought 
you’d be easy to talk to.” I lifted my 
eyebrows. “My friends talked about this 
new, Chinese girl who never speaks to 
anybody else on campus. But hey, now I 
get to know you!” I was dumbstruck. This 
weird Under Armour T-shirt guy, Jeff, 
a complete stranger to me 30 minutes 
prior, had now apparently become my 
friend. Just like that, with the snap of 
a finger, he’d struck up a conversation 
with a stranger — something I couldn’t 
possibly imagine. Just like that, Jeff had 
made himself special, even despite his 
hipster glasses and dorky T-shirt. 
When the dinner conversation came 
to an end, I stared at Jeff as he waved 
goodbye. Talking to people was so 
easy for Jeff. Even my dear, sweet, 
mellow Margaret looked courageous 

and dazzling in her sparkling dress, 
and now, my new friend had that same 
super power while curling forkfuls of 
spaghetti. Why was this so difficult for 
me? 
The question lingered. The following 
day, to celebrate my good grades, I still 
ran to Zweet and ordered the biggest 
acai bowl available. As I was chewing on 
fresh blueberries, a slim, tall girl walked 
in with a flowy satin dress. She looked 
like a supermodel. A voice started 
bubbling in my brain. I slowly moved 
out of my chair. “Excuse me,” I said to 
her, blushing a little, “But your dress is 
stunning.” The girl looked amazed, and 
her eyes twinkled. “Thank you!” she 
smiled, with a bit of shyness. “You’ve 
made my day.” 
Her twinkling eyes seemed to have 
a magical power. As more and more 
people came in for acai bowls, I couldn’t 
help but try to smile at anyone who 
made eye contact with me — the guy 
I’d seen often in the math building, the 
long-haired clerk behind the counter, 
the happy couple with a stroller. The 
act of a little smile was miraculous — I 
felt my mood lighten instantly. Just as I 
thought my day couldn’t have gotten any 
better, I caught sight of a guy whom I’d 
nicknamed “White Baseball Cap.” Now 

the voice within me was screaming. Mr. 
White Baseball Cap was murderously 
cute, and I’d wanted to talk to him since 
the start of the year. He wasn’t on his 
phone, and his friends weren’t around. 
Oh, dear god!? He liked acai bowls too? 
“Hey … you know … I’ve seen you 
around a lot lately. Would you mind … 
telling me your name?” 
Eric held out his hand. He had the 
prettiest smile. 
That evening, when I’d finished 
writing about this memory (or miracle, 
perhaps), I turned and saw my dear 
sweet Margaret quietly watching SNL 
in her kitty blanket again. Down the 
hall, the bathroom girls were gobbing 
on a thousand layers of makeup, and 
for a moment I imagined Margaret and 
I walking in there and actually telling 
them how fabulous they looked. I doubted 
if Margaret was up to the task, however, 
so I kept my admiration a secret. Yet 
either way, it was enough to know that a 
different girl was sitting at my desk just 
then. Certainly, she was still a little bit 
awkward, but if she wanted to know the 
best way to put on sparkly lip gloss, all 
she had to do was snap her fingers, and 
just like that, say, “Hello,” and ask. Not 
even Mickey Mouse pajamas could stop 
her if she wanted.

Nevertheless,

I 

was a sophomore in high school when I first 
decided to identify as a feminist. 
My English teacher at the time was a 
charismatic and outspoken man. Everyone wanted 
him as their teacher because he used iPads in his 
class and assigned fun projects instead of papers on 
“The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.” What I slowly 
came to realize as a student in his class was how oddly 
invested he was in his female students, but only in the 
ones who were sweet, soft-spoken and typically had 
big breasts. I was unsettled by his behavior from the 

beginning and actively called him out on it, which 
(unfairly) had an effect on my grades. I was the first to 
raise my hand and argue when his analysis of our class 
readings turned into unnecessarily, oversexualized 
discussions of characters that weren’t straight white 
males.
I was also quick to question him whenever I saw 
him taking pictures of unsuspecting girls on the fancy 
Google glasses he had recently gotten as a gift. During 
the course of that year, I saw him constantly stare at 
my friends’ butts and breasts and heard him say to a 
group of students that he “could always tell when a 
girl is wearing a dress with a thong.” 
Someone told me that some of my peers filed a joint 
report over his harassment to the principal, but the 
only news that was published about him by the time 
I graduated was that the school board had given him 
$75,000 to create a new technology center in our 
library.
That same year, I started taking voice lessons from 
a man who prided himself on teaching only the most 
talented and promising students that my hometown 
had to offer. I only heard rave reviews about him, and 
I assumed that if his other students got solos and roles 
as a result of taking lessons from him, then he could 
help me as well. He taught out of a practice room in a 
local church on Sunday afternoons when no one was 
around — which should have been red flag number 
one, but I was 15, naive and I trusted the opinions of 
my peers. 
In the few months I took lessons from him, I 
improved greatly and started racking up solos for my 
choir concerts. I never had any concerns about him, 
and I was blindsided one day when, instead of diving 
directly into warm-ups at the beginning of my lesson, 
he sat me down to tell me he no longer wanted to 
work with me. He said it was due to my “poor attitude 
and constant gossiping about other students.” Those 
words were (and are) entirely untrue. I had never 
said a bad word about any of my peers without his 
encouragement; the only times I did were because he 
was trashing them to begin with, and I thought the 
only way to stay on his good side was to join in.

For the entirety of my 45-minute, pre-paid lesson, 
this man, who claimed to be a serious professional 
in his field, told me how bad a person I was while I 
sat there silently crying. I had nowhere to go — my 
dad had dropped me off and would not be back until 
the end. It wasn’t until after I stopped taking lessons 
from him that I found out that he once told a friend 
to “shape her mouth like she was giving a blowjob” 
during vocal warm-ups. This man continued to teach 
teenagers and garner praise for the next five years. In 
September 2018, I received a call from my mom, and 
she told me there was a lawsuit against him. He had 
sexually assaulted one of my classmates.
Everyone finds their feminist identity on their own 
time and for their own reasons. Mine so happened to 
develop as a direct result of two specific experiences 
of injustice at the hands of men in power, which 
continues to shape my feminism to this day. 
In my haze to try and process this gross misuse of 
authority by some men in my life, I started using the 
phrase “I hate men” — both jokingly and seriously. 
Phrases like this, as well as “men are trash,” “men 
are scum” and “men ain’t shit,” are commonplace 
nowadays among millennials and Gen Zs. Tweets 
trashing men are likely to get favorites and maybe even 
go viral. The once-#1 song on the Billboard charts has 
an opening lyric of “Why men great ‘til they gotta be 
great?” The last Buzzfeed listicle I read was entitled 
“16 ‘Men Have Underdeveloped Frontal Lobe’ Tweets 
To Put a Smile On Straight Women’s Faces.” In 2019, it 
is trendy to rip on an entire gender.
Perhaps this trend is why critics of feminism 
have taken to saying there is a “war on men.” I first 
learned about this narrative when former Fox News 
contributor Suzanne Venker wrote an op-ed in 2012 
entitled “The war on men,” criticizing women for 
being irrationally angry toward the opposite gender 
and for regarding men as the enemy. 
Most recently, the New York Post published a piece 
accusing presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren of 
promoting a feminist agenda that borders on declaring 
a “war on men.” During a rally at Washington Square 
Park, she had said, “I wanted to give this speech right 

here and not because of the arch behind me or the 
president this square is named for — nope ... We are 
not here today because of famous arches or famous 
men ... In fact, we’re not here because of men at all.” 
It is also interesting to note that both of these articles 
were written by women. 
Let me acknowledge some things: The women who 
wrote these articles might have never experienced 
sexism or violence or manipulation at the hands of 
men (although I highly doubt it). There are certainly 
women out there who identify as feminists and support 
a platform entirely based around the demonization 
of men — which I don’t believe to be feminism, but 
misandry. There are also women who have falsely 
reported being sexually assaulted by men — though 
this statistic is reportedly frequently inflated. None 
of these things give any merit to the supposed “war 
on men.”
I am not here to defend an all-out smear campaign 
on the male gender, but what the perpetrators of this 
narrative do not realize is that there cannot really be 
a war on a gender that has always had, and potentially 
will always have the upper-hand — at least for the 
forseeable future. The difference between being male 
and female is that men can strike fear into women by 
just existing. I am vulnerable because I am a woman 
living on Earth, and that is a truth I will grapple with 
every day for the rest of my life. 
There is a reason hating on men is trendy, and even 
socially encouraged, in this day and age: Women are 
trying to have a semblance of control in this power 
discourse. If women feel like they will never be able to 
be equal in society to men, then perhaps joking around 
on Twitter is one way we can retain some autonomy.
This discussion is one-sided because I only speak 
for myself and my experiences as a straight, white 
woman. I cannot imagine how the vulnerability 
associated with being a woman increases for those 
of different races, sexualities, gender identities, etc. 
Maybe I sound paranoid or dramatic, or even anti-
feminist, for “letting” men have this much effect on 
me. However, I know for a fact that all of the women 
in my life have experienced genuine fear, trauma, and/

or pain at the hands of men.
When I first started saying 
things like “I hate men” as 
a young, teenage feminist, 
I was usually greeted with 
responses of disgust. People 
— usually men — said to me, 
“OK, no you don’t” and “Do 
you really hate all men?” And 
these people would be right 
— I don’t. My brother, dad 
and grandfathers are some 
of my favorite people in the 
whole world, and my male friends are absolutely lovely 
in every way. I have only respect for honorable men 
that I have worked alongside, worked for, and even 
those I have not met and may never meet. But what 
I have come to notice in my 21 years of experience on 
this planet is that good men who are secure in their 
masculinity are never actually the ones immediately 
enraged by a playful “men are trash” joke on Twitter. 
Respectable men do not have to assure other people 
with their words that they are good; it should be 
evident in their actions. Men who utilized the trend 
of #NotAllMen to prove that they were not like other 
men were probably just like the type of men they were 
claiming they weren’t. Sure, a large number of the male 
population are upstanding people, but every single 
member of the female population will be subjected 
to some type of sexism, misogyny, harassment or 
violence at some point in their lives. 
Is it really worth the time to distinguish between 
who is moral and immoral among men if the 
immoral are what cause women to mistrust an 
entire gender? Women on the internet fought back 
against this insensitive hashtag with creating their 
own. #NotAllMen but #YesAllWomen, as women on 
Twitter said in 2014. 
So yes, I do not, in fact, hate all men. However, 
here are some things I do hate: I hate that 85 percent 
of true crime fans (including myself) are women 
because they feel the need to learn how to prevent 
it. I hate that I remember where and when the first 

time I got catcalled was, 
and I hate that I knew 
it was certainly not the 
last time. I hate that I 
have been followed by 
men while driving before, 
and that not even the 
3,500 pounds of metal 
surrounding 
me 
could 
make me feel safe in those 
moments. I hate that a 
client at my internship 
two summers ago made 
jokes about me being a sex worker, and all my boss did 
was laugh. I hate that I have had to cut off two separate 
friendships with guys in the past year for either being 
emotionally manipulative or making repeated sexual 
comments even after I expressed my discomfort.

Everyone finds their 
feminist identity on their

own reasons. Mine so 
happened to develop as 
a direct result of two 
specific experiences of 
injustice at the hands 
of men in power, which 
continues to shape my 
feminism to this day.

From Page 5C

I hate that I can demarcate the 
milestones in my life when my 
mistrust in men as a whole has 
grown stronger and stronger. I hate 
that I have built up impenetrable 
walls as a result of my experiences, 
and I hate that this has an effect 
on my ability to date and let down 
my guard enough to feel any type 
of intimacy. But the thing I hate 
the most is that as long as I am 
living and breathing, I will remain 
susceptible to further fearful and 
anxiety-inducing experiences with 
men.
I am sure it is hard to believe 
from a man’s perspective — unless 
they have seen it firsthand — that 
living as a woman means inherently 
having to expect the worst as a way 
to maintain safety and sanity. In 
fact, the concept of belief is a hot 
topic as of recent years in the storm 
of the #MeToo era. And listen, I get 
it. 
We are human beings, not 
puppets who should mindlessly 
agree with everything we are told. 
It is perfectly normal to approach 
things unfamiliar to us with doubt. 
I can understand why the men who 
have never personally harassed anyone 
or been exposed to assault, and even 
women who have never been sexually 
assaulted, would proceed with caution 
when standing alongside women who 
are outspoken about their traumatic 
experiences. But being apathetic means 
involuntarily siding with the non-
believers and the supporters of men 
who are sexual assailants. 
There’s a difference between healthy 
doubt and plain ignorance. In 2017, 
former New Republic editor Moira 
Donegan created an anonymous Google 
spreadsheet as a place for women in the 
media to anonymously report sexual 
misconduct, but she took the document 
offline only 12 hours after hearing 
that Buzzfeed planned on publishing 
the document and its contributors. 
Prof. Christine Blasey Ford waited 36 
years to confess that she was sexually 
assaulted by Supreme Court justice 
Brett Kavanaugh. Chanel Miller did 
not step forward as “Emily Doe” in the 
Brock Turner rape case until just last 
month, four years after the trial. All of 
these women revealed their identities in 
order to expose themselves before news 

outlets did it for them, an attempt 
to take back a semblance of their 
autonomy. It is no wonder that 
three out of every four sexual 
assaults go unreported. 
This fear is why humor persists 
as a socially acceptable way 
to talk about these real issues 
that face women. Presenting 
truths through the form of a 
funny tweet or a 10-second 
TikTok or a viral meme makes 
them 
non-threatening. 
After 
all, that is what jokes are — 
exaggerations 
of 
the 
truth. 
They are funny because there is 
some semblance of relatability 
in them. We need to stop, as a 
society, placing restrictions on 
the way people speak about their 
trauma. A woman coping with 
everyday 
micro-harassments 
by constantly tweeting jokes 
about how men are the worst 
is no less valid than a woman 
who publishes a serious memoir 
about her experience with being 
sexually assaulted. Let’s stop 
penalizing women for talking 
about 
women’s 
issues, 
OK? 
After all, there is no one more 
qualified.

Presenting truths 
through the form of 
a funny tweet or a 
10-second TikTok or a 
viral meme makes them 
non-threatening. After 
all, that is what jokes 
are — exaggerations of 
the truth.

spresso 
Royale 
(specifically 
the one on State Street) prob-
ably isn’t anyone’s favorite Ann 
Arbor coffee shop. It’s the standard, the 
status quo, the closest to Central Cam-
pus and a reliable place to grab some 
quick caffeine in the morning or work on 
assignments in awkward half-hour class 
breaks. It doesn’t have Literati Coffee’s 
expansive selection of designer station-
ary, or the tasteful mismatched furni-
ture and sparse plants of Lab Cafe, or 
the coffee quality and quirky branding 
of Roo’s Roast.
Espresso belongs in a different cat-
egory than its other trendier Ann Arbor 
coffee shop siblings. It’s a little rough 
around the edges — most of the tables are 
a bit wobbly, the walls could use a fresh 
coat of paint and the carpet has some 
suspicious stains. Espresso Royale is, at 
its core, essentially your standard col-
lege coffee shop — a little grimy, heavily 
trafficked, a place to meet for interviews 
or quick “catch-ups” with friends you 
lived down the hall from freshman year. 
It’s also probably the Ann Arbor 
locale I’ve spent the most time in during 
these past three years at the University 
of Michigan (living quarters excluded, 
obviously). Espresso Royale is reliable, 
it’s comforting. The coffee shop is not 
pretending to be anything it isn’t — 
that’s what I like about it. As I write this 
column at a table in the back, a woman 
sitting in one of the armchairs clustered 
in the center of the main room is filing 
her toenails. Gross, yes, but also some-
how exactly what I would expect from 
this coffee shop. It’s not a performative 
place — I don’t feel pressured to pres-
ent a façade of the productive student 
who also looks incredibly put together at 
every instant. This is a space where any-
thing goes, unfortunately toenail filing 
included. 
One of the many quirks of Espresso 
Royale is that you never know if the 
internet will be working. More often 
than not, it will trickle along at a snail’s 
pace. Espresso Royale is not the place to 
watch lecture recordings—I learned this 
the semester I had Stats 250 at 8:30 a.m. 
and rarely made the trek from South 
Quad to class in the MLB. It’s also really 
not the place to go if you need to buckle 
down on work. I’ve met many friends 
here over the years to work on various 
projects, and though the Wi-Fi speed is 
always initially a frustration, it also has 
been the initiator of many incredible 

conversations when the laptops inevita-
bly close after struggling to load Canvas 
for the better part of an hour. 
The internet speed might be a deal-
breaker for some, but I’d argue that 
to the contrary, it’s nice to have some 
(minor) inconveniences imposed on you 
occasionally. I thoroughly enjoy going 
through the cycle of complaining about 
the internet connection, but also refus-
ing to relocate to a study spot with bet-
ter Wi-Fi. Perhaps it’s my subconscious 
seeking some disconnect from the digi-
tal sphere and associated stresses, but 
whatever it is, Espresso Royale somehow 
knows exactly how to address that need 
without requiring me to take some dras-
tic and deliberate action like disconnect-
ing from my home Wi-Fi network—for 
which I am very thankful.
And while your internet page might 
never load, there’s also no need to worry 
about getting distracted from whatever 
off-line task you’ve found to keep your-
self occupied by the background music—

another wonderful quirk of Espresso 
Royale is that the store playlist is thor-
oughly unexciting. It’s all songs that are 
super familiar and non-confrontational. 
Right now, “I’m Yours” by Jason Mraz 
is playing. I’ve heard a lot of the Eagles 
here, and a lot of Fleetwood Mac. Noth-
ing that I would really choose to actively 
listen to, but there’s something so com-
forting about a blanket of music that is 
passively recognizable. It’s the music 
that might be playing in my grandpar-
ents’ house, music that I’ve heard from 
a young age and is buried deep within 
me. Nothing new or edgy, nothing that’s 
going to demand my attention or pique 
my interest. It’s the musical equivalent 
of a cup of hot tea—nothing to write 
home about, but a nice warm presence 
regardless.
I’ve been interviewed for intern-
ships in this space and opened rejection 
emails from internships here. I’ve had 
first dates here, and I’ve fought with 
friends here. I’ve laughed and also cried 

here, after bad exams and as a result of 
heart-wrenching conversations about 
identity and social justice and things 
that really matter. Espresso Royale has 
marked just about every milestone of my 
college career—from freshman year to 
senior year, this coffee shop has seen it 
all. 
This coffee shop feels like college. It 
feels a little messy, a hodge-podge of dif-
ferent personalities and energies con-
tinuously entering and exiting. It feels 
like a place of personal exploration, of 
the occasional existential crisis, of bud-
ding friendships. It feels like hangovers 
and it feels like cramming for an exam 
the hour before. 
So, Espresso Royale, thank you for 
your overwhelming mediocrity and nor-
malness — it’s what I love the most about 
you. And though I’ve certainly been 
disloyal to you for other, trendier Ann 
Arbor coffee shops, I have a feeling I’ll 
keep coming back here — bad Wi-Fi and 
all.

Michigan staves off Illinois 42-25, set for Penn State clash

CHAMPAIGN — For all the 

pent-up 
concern 
about 
this 

Michigan football team, there 

was never much of a question as 

to whether it would beat Illinois 

on Saturday. The question lay in 

the “how” of it. 

For a time, it seemed like 

Michigan (5-1 overall, 2-1 Big 

Ten) might answer that question 

emphatically, 
beating 
down 

Illinois and taking momentum 

into a trip to Penn State next 

week. But it’s hard to be 

optimistic after a second half in 

which the offense stalled, the 

defense let Illinois back into the 

game and the Wolverines needed 

late heroics in a 42-25 win over 

the Illini.

Those late heroics came on 

both sides of the ball. Once 

Illinois had cut into a 28-0 lead 

to make it a three-point game 

early in the fourth quarter, senior 

quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 

strung together a 10-play drive, 

converting a key fourth-and-2 

in the red zone with his legs and 

lofting a pass that found junior 

wideout Donovan Peoples-Jones 

in the corner of the end zone.

That brought the lead back 

to 10 and from there, it was 

the defense’s turn. Sophomore 

linebacker Cam McGrone and 

fifth-year senior defensive end 

Mike Danna forced fumbles on 

two consecutive Illinois drives, 

killing any chance of a comeback 

and securing the win.

“The things I’m proud of as a 

team is — there wasn’t this, ‘Here 

we go again,’ ” said Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh. “They rose 

up and got a few fumbles of our 

own.”

Still, especially against Illinois, 

a perennial Big Ten doormat with 

a 2-4 overall record, it’s hard to 

square the victory itself with 

everything that made it so hard 

to get. 

On paper, this should have 

been easy for Michigan, and for 

the first half, it was. The offense 

ran the ball straight down Illinois’ 

throat, 
passing 
last 
week’s 

rushing yards total by the end 

of their fourth drive. Patterson 

worked off that success, hitting 

sophomore Luke Schoonmaker 

and senior Nick Eubanks for 

touchdowns to make the lead to 

28-7 at halftime. 

Then it nearly fell apart. The 

offense fell back into its struggles 

after Illinois started slanting 

a defensive end hard in the 

run game. Patterson’s rhythm 

seemed off in the passing game, 

and the Wolverines didn’t score 

in the third quarter as its defense 

gave up 10 more points.

Suddenly, minutes into the 

fourth, senior running back 

Tru Wilson fumbled — the 

same issues that have haunted 

Michigan all year cropping up 

again. Illinois running back Dre 

Brown scored and then converted 

a two-point attempt to make it 

28-25 with 12:50 to go.

“Anytime you got a lead like 

that, coming out of the second 

half you gotta keep the foot on 

the pedal and in full throttle,” 

Patterson said, admitting there 

was frustration. “But sometimes 

in a game, it happens like that and 

just gotta stay within ourselves.”

Michigan did, but still, the tune 

felt familiar. Here the Wolverines 

were, again, fumbling the ball, 

playing down to an opponent and 

taking a win that felt just a little 

bit hollow.

“I think it was after they 

scored a two-point conversion, 

everybody kinda started wilding 

up and not really trusting each 

other at that moment,” McGrone 

said. “But I think we got back to 

the sideline, got to talk. It’s all 

good.”

It 
was 
an 
oddly 
candid 

moment from McGrone, who 

admitted things started to break 

down with the defense yelling at 

the offense as others continued 

to speak in the language of 

optimism and positivity. 

To be sure, there are positives 

to take. A season-high average of 

6.1 yards per carry behind Zach 

Charbonnet and Hassan Haskins 

— and a first-half stretch in which 

Josh Gattis’ offense seemed 

to work as intended. Another 

standout 
performance 
from 

sophomore wideout Ronnie Bell, 

who went for 98 yards as Nico 

Collins sat out with an injury. 

Another game in which the 

defense stepped up when asked.

Harbaugh, standing at the 

podium afterwards with his 

hands in his pockets, seemed 

genuine in his praise. “Pleased 

with the way the offense played,” 

he said. “Thought they performed 

extremely well.”

Michigan 
will 
take 
the 

win. But to meet any of their 

preseason goals, the Wolverines 

must navigate a gauntlet that still 

includes Penn State, Notre Dame, 

Michigan State and Ohio State. 

“Our 
guys 
rose 
to 
the 

challenge,” Harbaugh said. “They 

were tested mightily and they did 

a great job. Didn’t flinch, kept 

playing, kept fighting.”

But when the challenge gets 

greater — starting next week in 

State College — it could take a 

whole lot more to meet it.

T

wo seasons ago in mid-
October, Michigan held 
a 5-1 
record that 
seemed to 
paper over 
greater con-
cerns. The 
Wolverines 
went into half-
time with Cin-
cinnati and Air 
Force in games 
at home. John 
O’Korn strug-
gled to replace Wilton Speight at 
quarterback after he went down 
with an injury and the offense 
lagged its way to a loss at home 
against Michigan State. It took two 
overtimes to put away Indiana in 
Bloomington the week after that.
Two days later, Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh got asked about 
the next game on the schedule — a 
prime-time matchup with Penn 
State, a white out and a College 
Gameday visit to Happy Valley.
“I’m excited about it,” Harbaugh 
told reporters then, “and if you talk 
to the players about how they feel, 
I feel like they would feel the same 
way. Excited for the opportunity. 
They’ve been on the big stage 
already this year multiple times 
in big games and having another 
crack at this, knowing our guys the 
way I do, they’re competitors.”
You probably already know 
what happened next. If you don’t, 
here’s a refresher: Penn State’s 
Saquon Barkley took the game’s 
second snap for a 69-yard touch-
down, and it got worse from there. 
All the problems the first six games 
of the season foreshadowed came 
to pass. The Wolverines lost, 42-13, 
all but eliminating themselves 
from Playoff and Big Ten conten-
tion and before the season was 
over, they would lose three more 
times for the worst mark of Har-
baugh’s tenure.
It’s hard not to see the parallels.
Again, Michigan is 5-1 in mid-
October heading into a matchup 
with Penn State. Again, there have 
been a series of less-than-con-

vincing wins — double-overtime 
at home against Army, scoring 
10 points at home against Iowa, 
and most recently, Illinois pulling 
within a three-
point deficit at the 
start of the fourth 
quarter. Again, 
the game is in 
prime time, with 
College Gameday 
in Happy Valley, 
and there will be a 
white out.
“Every loss 
sticks with me,” 
said senior safety 
Josh Metellus on Tuesday. “That 
one (in 2017) really stuck. That 
could’ve been the real defining 
part of our season. We lost that 
game and we went downhill from 

there.”
Of course, that loss was the 
defining point in Michigan’s sea-
son — just not in the way Metellus 
wanted it to be. It 
put the Wolver-
ines’ flaws on dis-
play for everyone 
to see. It ended the 
chances of meet-
ing their goals.
If they lose on 
Saturday, be it in 
the same spec-
tacular fashion 
or not, it could 
set the season on 
the same course as two years ago. 
Michigan isn’t expected to win 
this game — Vegas currently has 
Penn State as a nine-point favor-
ite and, going by the eye test, it’s 

hard to argue the Wolverines are 
the better team. Inside of Schem-
bechler Hall, predictably, belief 
has permeated on both sides of the 
ball.
“We execute, 
there’s nobody in 
the country bet-
ter than us,” said 
senior linebacker 
Josh Uche this 
Monday, speaking 
about the defense. 
“And that’s a fact.”
Uche, minutes 
earlier, had taken 
the media to task 
for calling out the defense after 
the Wolverines’ loss at Wisconsin. 
He took the criticism to heart, 
adamantly contending that it was 
misplaced, that those outside the 

team couldn’t possibly understand 
schematics well enough to accu-
rately comment on things of that 
nature.
When a 
reporter pointed 
out the bottom 
line — Michigan 
gave up 35 points 
to the Badgers and 
let them run for 
359 yards — must 
mean something, 
Uche bristled. 
“That’s what y’all 
was claiming,” he 
said.
To Uche’s credit, the defense, 
even to the untrained eye, has been 
significantly improved since that 
day in Madison. The stats back 
that up, as the Wolverines are third 

in defensive SP+. They have won 
three straight games, and have the 
defense to thank, as it’s given up 
just 28 total points in that span.
“We feel a lot better. We’ve been 
feeling like we’re getting back to 
our roots,” Metellus said. “We 
know we got a lotta guys that can 
play football. We all know what 
we’re capable of doing.”
For the last few weeks, that’s 
been a common theme. After the 
Wolverines scored just 10 points 
against Iowa, Harbaugh claimed 
the offense was hitting its stride 
and later in the week, senior quar-
terback Shea Patterson backed him 
up. Both fell back on what fans and 
media couldn’t see — in practice 
and on tape — to argue that the 
score wasn’t representative.
And, to the credit of Harbaugh 
and Patterson, the offense clicked 
for stretches against Illinois in 
ways that it hadn’t all year. Michi-
gan averaged 6.1 yards per run, 
and came out looking to hand the 
ball off with eight straight runs. 
Patterson stepped up in the fourth 
quarter with a clutch 79-yard 
drive, perhaps his best moment of 
the year.
Doing all of that against a team 
of the Nittany Lions’ caliber — one 
that could easily beat even a good 
defense — is another matter entire-
ly. So is doing it against Notre 
Dame, Michigan State and Ohio 
State. Throughout Harbaugh’s ten-
ure, and never more so than 2017, 
an inability to get it done against 
those kinds of teams has come to 
be the nagging factor underlying 
any success.
“We already got a loss,” 
Metellus said. “We can’t afford 
another one.”
Win or lose, Saturday will set 
the Wolverines’ season on its 
defining course. So if Michigan 
wants to back up its words and 
make the public eat theirs, it 
should start before the second 
snap.

A repeat of 2017 rout would end Michigan’s season

Hassan Haskins making most of his opportunity

Position switches in football 
are relatively common, but what 
happened to Hassan Haskins is 
much more rare.
The redshirt freshman doesn’t 
remember exactly when, but he 
knows that sometime last year, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
called him in for a meeting and 
told him that instead of playing 
running back, where he was 
recruited, his best fit was at 
linebacker. But after a season 
of learning how to play viper, 
Haskins switched back to his 
original position.
For many players, such a switch 
would delay their development 
and keep them from seeing the 
field much. Not for Haskins.
Saturday 
in 
Champaign, 
Haskins took the field on the fifth 
play of the Wolverines’ first drive. 
On their four previous plays, 
freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet had run all the way to 
the 29-yard line, but Haskins did 

him one better.
After the handoff, Haskins 
spun past his would-be tackler 
and broke through, with nothing 
but turf between him and the end 
zone. He topped off his first career 
touchdown with an emphatic fist 
pump.
“I 
was 
trying 
to 
get 
a 
touchdown,” 
Haskins 
said. 
“Every play I run, I’m trying to get 
a touchdown. I just move. I felt it 
after my spin — nobody around 
me, so I took off.”
Added senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks: “I was blocking, was 
thinking the play was over and 
this dude springs out from a tackle 
and keeps his feet going, so I was 
kinda surprised.”
Haskins finished the game 
with 125 yards on 12 rushes and 
was Michigan’s leading rusher 
on the day in net yards, yards per 
rush (10.4) and longest run (29 
yards).
But the performance didn’t 
come from nowhere. Anyone 
who’s been watching the last few 
games could see that Haskins was 

primed for a breakout. Against 
Rutgers two weeks ago, Haskins 
ran for 45 yards, including a 
game-high 15-yard run. He also 
garnered 22 yards on 10 carries 
against Iowa and even made 
a tackle while playing special 
teams.
If Haskins ever questioned the 
coaches’ plans for him, he never 
said so Monday, instead repeating 
that he was willing to do whatever 
it took to help the team and that 
he wanted to make the most of 
any opportunity he got, no matter 
what side of the ball. And instead 

of stunting his development, 
Haskins believes the switch to 
linebacker aided him when he 
returned to running back.
“I feel like I can tell what the 
defense, what they doing, so 
they help me for sure.” Haskins 
said. “I feel like I got a defensive 
mindset. I think I have a better 
vision of a running lane. I’m more 
comfortable.”
Senior viper Khaleke Hudson 
worked with Haskins during his 
brief foray into playing defense 
and in Haskins saw a fast-twitch 
player with good instincts and a 
knack for the ball. Linebackers 
have to see the same holes as the 
running backs — and their success 
is often predicated on seeing those 
holes before the running backs do.
From 
his 
vantage 
point, 
Hudson sees how much Haskins’ 
experience on the other side 
helped his vision. But he also 
made sure to add that Haskins 
was “great in man coverage” and 
“could definitely come back and 
play on the defensive side of the 
ball” if Michigan ever needed him.
Now, Haskins seems to have 
firmly cemented himself as the 
fourth member of the Wolverines’ 
running back rotation, a unit that 
seemed to finally find its footing 
against the Illini after several 
lackluster games. And if his 
teammates and coaches are to be 
believed, this is just the start for 
Haskins.
“The progression has been 
ascending each and every week,” 
Harbaugh said. “Some wild type 
of plays in practice and now 
we’ve seen it in games, somebody 
getting better and better. This last 
game was a great game, 100 yards. 
… His ability to see holes, sink his 
hips, get yards after contact really 
showed up.”

‘M’ beats Wildcats in OT

After a grueling fight, during 
the final minute of regulation play, 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Raleigh 
Loughman fired a powerful corner 
kick into a crowded box and 
was able to connect with junior 
midfielder 
Nicki 
Hernandez. 
Hernandez executed a precise 
header that met the back of the net 
and earned the Michigan women’s 
soccer team a well-deserved first 
goal of the match.
What seemed like the winner 
was anything but as just a few 
seconds after the first goal, a 
handball inside the box off a corner 
kick resulted in a Northwestern 
penalty kick. Wildcats forward 
Mikayla Hampton scored from the 
spot tying up the game and sending 
it to overtime — the Wolverines’ 
fourth OT game of the season.
After beating Illinois 4-1 on 
Friday, Michigan (11-3-1 overall, 
6-1-1 Big Ten) had the confidence to 
prevail against Northwestern (5-7-
2, 3-3-1) in overtime after a grueling 
fight. 
Both 
teams 
came 
into 
Sunday’s matchup off of conference 
victories on Friday — Michigan 
defeated Illinois and Northwestern 
beat Michigan State—adding to the 
excitement of Sunday afternoon’s 
game.
The Wolverines endured two 
long shots in the first six minutes 
of the match and responded with 
force, keeping the ball out of the box 
and creating more opportunities 
during buildup play for shots 
against the Wildcats’ aggressive 
defensive 
line. 
Michigan’s 
top 
scorer, junior midfielder Sarah 
Stratigakis, was able beat her 
defender and take a shot late in the 
half that was eventually blocked, 
with another shot attempt in the 
final two minutes of the half.
Though 
Northwestern 
had 
greater ball possession during the 
first half, it appeared as if Michigan 
had the ball more due to its excellent 
ball control, communication in 
the midfield and ambitious shot 
attempts. Freshman Jayde Riviere 
was key to this midfield control 
by consistently outrunning her 
opponents and preventing the 
Wildcats 
from 
executing 
on 
opportunities inside the box.

 The Wolverines were especially 
hungry to beat Northwestern, who 
won its last two matchups. Adding 
to the stakes, Michigan hadn’t been 
victorious in Evanston since 2013 — 
where the conditions always prove 
difficult.
 “We were aware that with the 
location of their field that it was 
going to be windy,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein, “so we really 
wanted to keep the ball on the 
ground and connect passes to get up 
into the final third.”
At the start of the second half, the 
Wolverines’ offense continued to 
struggle to penetrate the Wildcats’ 
defense, while the defense was 
threatened by Northwestern’s shots 
on goal. Riverie’s two powerful, 
ambitious shots from 30 yards out 
showed that Michigan would be 
relentless until its shots connected 
with the back of the net.
“They (the team) felt like they 
created some good opportunities 
in the run of play and just were a 
bit unfortunate, so I think for them 
they wanted to win and so they 
went out and got it,” Klein said.
In 
overtime, 
Michigan’s 
effort was there and it outshot 
Northwestern 3-0. During the 8th 
minute of the first overtime half, 
sophomore midfielder Meredith 
Haakeson was unstoppable after a 
clean assist from freshman forward 
Hannah Blake, sending the ball 
into the right corner of the net 
and scoring a Michigan victory. 
Haakeson is now the Wolverines’ 
top scorer.
Klein led Michigan back into the 
Big Ten Tournament for the first 
time since 2016 last season, and 
another conference victory shows 
the team is continuing to grow this 
season under her guidance. The win 
marks the first time that Michigan 
has reached double-digit wins since 
2016 when it made its last NCAA 
Tournament appearance.
“The changing of the culture 
and of the style of play has led to 
that,” Klein said. “But I think a big 
thing that we did from last year 
to this year that is putting us in a 
better position to get those results 
is our commitment to be disciplined 
defensively, and I think the girls 
have done a great job responding 
to that and being relentless to help 
keep the ball out of our net.”

Offense 
shows ceiling, 
and how it 
must go

CHAMPAIGN — Nick Eubanks didn’t 
have to break stride as Shea Patterson’s 
pass floated towards the back of the end 
zone and into his arms.
The only celebration necessary was 
a pair of chest thumps and a quick point 
to the sky, honoring his late mother. The 
groan from the Illinois fans was virtually 
non-existent. In the equal portion of the 
crowd donning maize and blue, cheers 
were similarly subdued.
With the score at 28-0 and less than 
half a game gone, it made sense, because 
this is Michigan and they are Illinois and 
this is what Michigan does to a team like 
Illinois. Or, at least, that’s what you’d like 
to believe.
Then, there’s the scene 20 minutes of 
game time later.
The 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
line 
returned from giving up yet another 
touchdown with nothing to do but lean 
back into the benches lining Michigan’s 
sideline, faces expressionless as the 
scoreboard read, Michigan 28, Illinois 25.
The thing is: it wasn’t really the 
defense’s fault.
Of the Illini’s four scoring drives, 
only one started inside its own 33. The 
Wolverines lost a pair of fumbles and 
even when they held onto the ball, they 
couldn’t do anything with it. Illinois — 
2-4 Illinois, lost-to-Eastern-Michigan 
Illinois — dominated time of possession 
as a result, wearing down a thin Michigan 
defense.
“In the second half, they came out and 
they hit us in the mouth,” said sophomore 
receiver Ronnie Bell, understating the 
obvious.
The Wolverines eventually held on to 
win on the back of a defensive turnaround 
that forced consecutive fourth-quarter 
turnovers. The result was a 42-25 win, 
allowing Michigan to talk about fighting 
through adversity and all those good 
things.
“Third quarter, we had a bit of a 
momentum swing and we just gotta be 
ready to roll with the punches, just react 
to it,” Patterson said. “Call it adversity or 
whatever you want, at the end of the day, 
we gotta be ready for anything.”
The problem is, this is week seven. 
Being ready for adversity was the mantra 
when 
the 
Wolverines 
beat 
Middle 
Tennessee State, 40-21. That was the 
opening week, when adjusting to a new 
offensive install was understandable, 
when discrepancies between practices 
and games made sense.
Michigan’s next two games are against 
Penn State and Notre Dame, teams who 
wouldn’t stand for “adversity” against 
an opponent like Illinois. Their offenses 
average 39.0 and 41.0 points per game 
respectively.
For a half on Saturday, that’s the type 
of offense the Wolverines looked like they 
had. Their running game — averaging just 
3.5 yards per carry entering the day — went 
for 295 yards on 48 tries. Both freshman 
Zach Charbonnet and sophomore Hassan 
Haskins ran for over 100 yards, with 
the Illini defense on its heels against an 
offensive line that effortlessly created 
holes. “It starts up front,” said sophomore 
tight end Luke Schoonmaker. “Our line 
playing great ball, pushing guys back.”
Meanwhile, Patterson, much maligned 
for his senior-year regression, found 
receivers at will inside or outside the 
pocket. Even without junior receiver 
Nico Collins — arguably Michigan’s 
most talented playmaker — out injured, 
Patterson had two early touchdowns and 
found five receivers for completions.
“Shea Patterson had a great game,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. “Again, I 
don’t know what all the statistics and the 
numbers are, but that was tough throwing 
the ball today. And came up with the big 
throws.”
Those statistics and numbers tell the 
point. Patterson, with his 8.8 yards per 
attempt, four total touchdowns and no 
interceptions, did enough to beat a team 
like Illinois every time. With an 11-for-
22 passing performance, he also put his 
defense in short-field situations too often, 
allowing the Illini back into a game that 
should’ve been over at halftime.
So while Patterson said after the game 
that he was “never worried,” he couldn’t 
help but break a sheepish smile seconds 
later, when a reporter asked if there were 
any offensive frustrations.
“Yeah a little bit,” Patterson said. “Any 
time you got a lead like that, coming out in 
the second half, you gotta keep the foot on 
the pedal, full throttle. But sometimes, in 
games, that happens like that.”
Saturday afternoon, Michigan didn’t 
keep its foot on the pedal. The result, in 
the end, allowed Patterson to shrug it off. 
It also showed how far the Wolverines 
still have to go.

CHAMPAIGN — For a time, it all 
went down as easily as it should have. 
Michigan marched down the field 
on the first drive of Saturday’s game 
against Illinois, running the ball 
five consecutive times for 65 yards, 
capped by an impressive 29-yard 
touchdown run from junior Hassan 
Haskins. 
The 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
throw 
the ball until their ninth play from 
scrimmage, tallied 161 rushing yards 
in the first quarter alone and held a 
28-0 lead by the middle of the second 
quarter.
It looked every bit the contender-
meets-pretender matchup it had been 
billed. This game was dead, buried 
and sufficiently eulogized. It was on 
to Penn State.
And then, like The Undertaker 
rising swiftly from his coffin, Illinois 
found life.
In 
doing 
so 
— 
scoring 
25 
unanswered 
points 
and 
coming 
within three points of the lead, 
briefly putting Michigan’s season 
on life support — the Fighting Illini 
resurfaced a bevy of questions on 
both sides of the ball that have come 
to define the Michigan football season 
to date. Questions that will soon 
bury it if they don’t get answered. 
Promptly.
“Honestly, most of the defense, we 
kinda lost our heads a little bit,” said 
sophomore linebacker Cam McGrone 
after the game. “Like yelling at the 
offense, which we can’t do. But yeah, 
it was kinda like breaking down, but 
we all talked and we all kinda got 
back into our heads.”
Those 
frustrations 
reached 
a 
boiling point, he said, after Illinois 
cashed in a two-point conversation to 
make the score 28-25. After allowing 
just 29 yards on the first seven 
drives, Michigan’s defense yielded 

four consecutive scoring drives that 
amassed 214 yards in over 14 minutes 
of game time.
Offensively, Michigan did nothing 
to aid its scuffling defense. From the 
4:33 mark in the second quarter — 
when a touchdown from senior tight 
end Nick Eubanks extended the lead 
to 28 — to the end of the third quarter, 
the Wolverines’ offense mustered 
just 2.5 yards per play in five empty 
drives. The capper was a lost fumble, 
Michigan’s ninth of 
the season, that gave 
Illinois the ball in the 
Wolverines’ territory.
“In the running 
game, they made a 
nice adjustment with 
their defensive end,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim Harbaugh said. 
“Then we made a 
counter 
adjustment 
later in the ball game 
that really paid off for us. They were 
spiking their end hard and got us 
for a few. Then I thought (offensive 
coordinator) 
Josh 
(Gattis) 
and 
(offensive line coach) Ed (Warinner) 
and the coaches did a nice job 
countering that and they were able to 
get outside again with some big runs.”
The halftime break, sandwiched 
in between, did nothing to quell 
the resurgent Illini — the same 
group that lost to Ypsilanti-based 
Eastern Michigan earlier this season. 
Guided by backup quarterback Matt 
Robinson, who filled in for the injured 
Brandon Peters, Illinois appeared on 
the verge of quite an upset.
“Yeah, a little bit (of frustration),” 
said 
senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson. “Any time you’ve got 
a lead like that coming out of the 
second half, you’ve got to keep the 
foot on the pedal and full-throttle. 
Sometimes in a game, that happens 
like that. (We’ve) just got to stay 
within ourselves.”

There were no major scheme 
adjustments, McGrone said, nor a 
natural lack of focus. That’s when 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
gathered his defense to try and 
rejuvenate a suddenly-reeling group.
“He just told us to lock in play our 
game and we’ll come out with a win,” 
McGrone said.
To its credit, the unit responded. 
Michigan allowed just six more 
plays in the ensuing three drives — 
with two turnovers 
sealing the game. One 
came when McGrone 
grabbed ahold of a 
scrambling Robinson 
with his left hand 
and 
punched 
the 
football out with his 
right. The next when 
pressure 
off 
both 
edges helped pry the 
ball free, where in 
feel into the waiting 
arms of senior Carlo Kemp. 
Michigan’s 
defense 
allowed 
negative-21 
yards 
after 
Brown’s 
recalibration, closing out a forgettable 
win over an inferior foe. Now the real 
challenges beckon, with Penn State 
and Notre Dame looming in back-
to-back games, ready to unearth any 
facade that might come with a 5-1 
record. If Saturday’s game clarified 
anything about this team, it’s that 
the Wolverines have not moved past 
their sluggish past in any substantial 
way. Soon enough, with mounting 
competition, that will reflect in their 
win-loss record.
For now, until those tests arrive, 
Michigan will happily notch another 
in the former column.
“Third quarter, they made some 
plays and we did turn it over,” 
Harbaugh said. “And our guys rose 
to the challenge. They were tested 
mightily and they did a great job. 
Didn’t flinch, kept playing, kept 
fighting.”

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said his team rose to the challenge when Illinois came back to pull within three points in an eventual 42-25 win.

Fourth-
down 
conversion 
lifts ‘M’

CHAMPAIGN — There was a time in 
Jim Harbaugh’s past when, leading the 
game by a small margin and facing fourth-
and-short in the opponent’s territory, he 
opted to kick the field goal. It came back to 
bite him, and his team lost.
Harbaugh won’t go into specifics about 
which game it was or who it was against. 
But the truth is, the semantics aren’t really 
important. That exact situation could 
describe nearly every football coach in the 
country. Games are lost every week on the 
risks coaches don’t take, as much as the 
ones they do.
What’s important is that on Saturday, 
facing a pivot point in a game and possibly 
a season, Harbaugh remembered that 
game. Knowing that this wasn’t just about 
analytics, but about confidence and trust, 
Harbaugh took the risk and averted a 
crisis. Partially because of it, Michigan 
walked out with a 42-25 win against 
Illinois.
“The offense was hungry to do it,” 
Harbaugh said. “So made the decision to 
go for it on that fourth down, and the guys 
came through.”
The Wolverines went up by 28 early, 
then teetered on the brink of disaster 
as they allowed 25 unanswered points. 
Michigan drove down the field but stalled, 
facing fourth-and-2 at Illinois 13-yard line.
A lot of coaches would kick in that 
situation, in hopes of getting back some 
semblance of confidence or momentum, 
not wanting to risk an empty possession 
with the bottom daring to fall out.
But the Wolverines knew what they 
wanted to do. The offense trotted out 
and senior quarterback Shea Patterson 
took the ball himself, running for the first 
down. Two plays later, Michigan was in 
the end zone.
“We all knew that we wanted to get 
the first down and end the game on our 
terms,” said sophomore wide receiver 
Ronnie Bell.
Nobody 
doubted 
the 
call. 
The 
Wolverines wanted to finally answer back, 
and all another field goal would’ve done 
was put Michigan up six, where another 
Illini score could beat them. Going for it 
would put a touchdown within reach, and 
a touchdown was what the Wolverines 
really needed.
The truth is, to truly move the 
pendulum, Michigan needed more than 
just points. It needed to string together 
a full drive again, to get some mojo back. 
And everyone on the field knew it.
Asked after the game why he went for it, 
Harbaugh could’ve mentioned analytics, 
like he did after two failed fourth-down 
conversions last month against Army. He 
could’ve said that the wind made kicking 
difficult. He could’ve maintained that 
kicker Quinn Nordin had already missed 
once, from 34, or that the other kicker, Jake 
Moody, missed from a similar distance last 
week. But he didn’t say any of those things.
Instead, he made it clear that this was 
about trust.
“We put the ball in Shea Patterson’s 
hands,” Harbaugh said. “He is tenacious 
in those kinds of situations in these kinds 
of big moments and I felt really good that 
he could pick it up for us.”
Harbaugh’s trust in the offense — 
and Patterson, who started out well but 
reverted to his early-season struggles 
after halftime — to make a play provided 
one shot of confidence. The fact that the 
play worked added another. The rest of 
the game, the Wolverines looked how they 
had at the beginning. Driving down the 
field on offense. Making stops on defense. 
Playing like a team assured of itself.
“Definitely, our momentum spiked 
from there,” said redshirt freshman tight 
end Luke Schoonmaker.
We’ll never know what would’ve 
happened had Harbaugh chosen the 
“safe” option and kicked. It’s quite possible 
that the Wolverines still would’ve won. 
After all, Michigan tacked on another 
touchdown two possessions later and 
Illinois didn’t score again.
But once again, that’s not the important 
part.
The important part is that the call sent 
a message to the offense: I trust you. You 
aren’t going to blow this.
The important part is that through all 
their ups and downs this season, when the 
Wolverines most needed to make a play, 
they were given the opportunity.
And the important part is that, facing 
that kind of situation, they trusted each 
other, too — and converted.
Standing on the field after the game, the 
Michigan players treated it like a win. Not 
a “we almost blew this” win, an honest-to-
goodness, hard-fought win.
No matter the eventual outcome, 
kicking a field goal — into the wind with 
two kickers who have struggled — would 
have sent a very different message.

false alarm

Mid-game struggles resurface questions, but Michigan escapes with win

CHAMPAIGN — For two weeks, 
Michigan made it easy to forget the 
fumbling issues that haunted it all year.
After Ben Mason put the ball on 
the ground early in the Wolverines’ 
loss at Wisconsin — ending a scoring 
opportunity and setting Michigan on 
a spiral — they didn’t repeat the same 
mistake against Rutgers or Iowa. And, 
coincidence or not, they won both 
games, including a nail-biter against the 
Hawkeyes.
And, despite freshman running back 
Zach Charbonnet losing the ball in 
the second quarter against Illinois, it 
seemed like that would be relegated to 
a minor issue in the wake of a blowout. 
The Fighting Illini failed to capitalize, 
going three-and-out, another drive 
amounting to nothing in a game that 
figured to be full of them.
Then things started to go wrong for 
Michigan. Illinois climbed back into the 
game. And then, with the Wolverines 
holding onto an 11-point lead early in the 
fourth quarter, senior running back Tru 
Wilson fumbled and handed the Illini a 
chance to make it a one-score game — of 
which they did.
What happened next, the Wolverines 
working their way out of trouble to win, 

42-25, does little to hide one of the 
overarching issues of their season. After 
Saturday, they have fumbled 17 times, 
ranked 126th of 130 in the FBS, and lost 
nine. After six games in 2019, they have 
lost triple the number of fumbles they 
did in 2018 while passing their overall 
total in turnovers from the previous 
year.
“I think we didn’t even really think 
about (the fumbles),” said sophomore 
tight end Luke Schoonmaker. “We got 
right back up and knew that our defense 
was gonna hold for us. We were gonna 
answer and stay confident.”
That’s not too dissimilar to the 
answers we’ve heard from most players 
and Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, 
throughout the year when pressed on 
the issue. To hear them is to be painted a 
picture of a statistical anomaly. Among 
the disparities between practice and 
games — a talking point for any and 
every issue related to the offense — this 
seems to rank near the top.
Harbaugh has been asked, repeatedly, 
what he can do to coach the fumbles out 
of his team. He was again on Saturday.
“Coaching ball security all the way to 
the ground,” Harbaugh said, “through 
the whistle and the echo of the whistle 
and beyond.
“The things I’m proud of as a team 
is, there wasn’t this, ‘Here we go again.’ 

They rose up and got a few fumbles of 
our own. From where I was standing, 
we created some of our own.”
It’s more than valid after a win to turn 
the conversation to what Michigan did 
well. Where against the Wolverines let 
the fumble get into their heads against 
Wisconsin, they rose up against Illinois. 
Particularly the defense, which stepped 
up and forced two late turnovers to seal 
the game. But that doesn’t change the 
reality facing Michigan right now.
After six games, and with two top-
10 opponents looming in the next two 
weeks, this can no longer be swept 
aside as an issue that will inevitably 
be fixed. Because Penn State and 
Notre Dame aren’t Illinois. And if 
the Wolverines give either team an 
opportunity, they’ll pay dearly.
“Yeah a little bit (of frustration),” 
said 
senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson. “Anytime you got a lead like 
that, coming out of the second half you 
gotta keep the foot on the pedal and in 
full throttle. But sometimes in a game, 
it happens like that.”
“Couple fumbles that (we) wouldn’t 
have liked to seen,” Harbaugh added. 
“Outside of that, I think our offense 
was playing pretty darn good.”
With 
the 
oncoming 
schedule, 
though, it’s hard to be confident in 
caveats.

VOICES 
MANY

Before the puck even dropped, 
something was different about 
the Michigan lineup.
Freshman defenseman Cam 
York was out with a lower body 
injury. Junior forwards Michael 
Pastujov and Jack Becker didn’t 
dress, either.
Instead, the roster featured 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Jake 
Gingell, 
sophomore 
forward 
Jack Olmstead and redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 
Emil 
Öhrwall.
And as the last seconds 
ticked off the clock at Yost Ice 
Arena, 
Michigan 
(0-1-1) 
felt 
their absence, as it lost to No. 11 
Clarkson (1-0-1), 3-1.
“We had all the momentum,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. “But it’s a bounce or a 
break here. They won the game 
but I can’t tell you that they’re the 
better team. I thought we played 
well and they got some bounces 
and some goaltending. But I feel 
good about a lot of things going 
on in the program.” 
When the puck dropped, the 
Wolverines were ready to go. 
They fired shot after shot — none 
found the back of the net. But 
around the halfway point of the 
period, momentum started to 
slip away from Michigan. A shot 
came at sophomore goaltender 
Strauss Mann from the slot. 
Mann made the first save, but 
coughed up a rebound. A split 
second later, Golden Knights 
forward Adam Tisdale found 
the back of the net. Just like that, 
Clarkson took the lead, 1-0.
In the second period, the 
Wolverines were still unable 
to capitalize on their offensive 
opportunities. As the offense 
tried to even the score, in net, 
Mann worked tirelessly to keep 
his team down only one goal. He 
made glove saves. Pad saves. Stick 
saves. And even a couple saves 
while sprawled out on the ice.

“He was unbelievable this 
weekend,” 
said 
sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg. 
“The first three goals tonight, he 
didn’t have much of a chance on 
those. He’s keeping us in these 
games and he’s been great for us.”
Despite Mann’s impressive 
performance, 
the 
Wolverines 
found themselves down 2-0 
in the opening minutes of the 
third period after the Golden 
Knights 
recovered 
a 
Griffin 
Luce turnover, sailing a pass to 
the right post. Clarkson forward 
Anthony Romano was faced with 
an open net, and a blink later, he 
beat Mann.
Desperate to cut the deficit 
with only a period remaining, 
Michigan pushed harder. Its first 
— and only — goal of the game 
came with 14 minutes remaining 
on the clock.
Blankenburg 
found 
Jake 
Slaker alone in the left faceoff 
circle. With pressure coming, 
he hit a one-timer at Clarkson’s 
goaltender. The puck came loose, 
and a split second later it was on 
the stick of senior forward Nick 
Pastujov, who sent the puck 
sailing into the back of the net.
And with that, the Wolverines 
were on the board, but still 
trailing, 2-1.
“It’s definitely nice to get 
that first one however you can,” 
Pastujov 
said. 
“We’ve 
been 
battling a lot, and we’ve been 
getting good chances. It’s nice 
to just pop that first one and 
hopefully just start rolling.”
The 
momentum 
from 
Pastujov’s goal resulted in an 
onslaught of Michigan offense. 
Every time the puck found a 
stick in the offensive zone, the 
Wolverines fired it towards the 
net. They were playing with a 
sense of urgency for the first 
time all night. In just a span of 
eight minutes, Michigan tallied 
10 shots on goal.
As quick as the game had 
swung in favor of the Wolverines, 
the Golden Knights took back 

control. After redshirt junior 
Luke Morgan missed a shot on 
goal, Clarkson controlled the 
puck. Junior forward Grant 
Cooper skated the puck through 
center ice and into Michigan’s 
defensive zone. He fanned on the 
first attempt, but quickly rifled 
a backhanded shot into the net 
behind Mann.
Just like that, the Wolverines 
lost all momentum and were 
down two goals for the second 
time in the period.
Frustration 
set 
in. 
With 
under five remaining, Luce hit 
a Golden Knight from behind 
and earned a game misconduct. 
Because of the timing of the 
penalty, Michigan spent the 
remainder of the game playing a 
man down.
“You have to understand the 
time of the game, what’s going 
on, where you are on the ice, 
the situation,” Pearson said. 
“You have to understand that. I 
know Griff is — he plays hard, 
he plays physical. He plays all 
out. Sometimes, you just have 
to control your emotions and 
control your aggressiveness.
“You have to be more careful 
on that, especially (when) we’re 
doing everything we can to get 
back in the game.”

The defense was there.
The offense was coming along.
The 
penalty 
kill 
was 
an 
underlying factor in Friday’s 1-1 tie 
for the Michigan hockey team, and 
a key in keeping Saturday’s game 
close.
The power play, however, was 
not.
The 
Wolverines 
struggled 
with the man advantage, unable 
to capitalize on any of the seven 
penalties 
they 
drew 
Friday, 
and converted only one of five 
Saturday. 
Michigan’s 
inability 
to convert haunted them with 
wasted opportunities in a tight 3-1 
loss Saturday against Clarkson.
The struggle to score was 
reminiscent of last year, when the 
Wolverines capitalized on just 
16 percent of their power plays. 
With a different assistant coach 
helming the man advantage and a 
more modern system in play, hopes 
arose on Michigan’s ability to score 
on the given opportunities. This 
weekend series against Clarkson 
showed otherwise.
Michigan drew early penalties 
in the first and second periods 
on 
Saturday. 
Yet, 
somehow 
the 
Golden 
Knights, 
despite 
being short a player, outshot the 

Wolverines.
“I think over time we are going 
to get more comfortable with 
ourselves,” said senior forward 
Nick Pastujov, “and you’ll see a lot 
more goals.”
Michigan looked uncomfortable 
on the man advantage early in the 
game, moving the puck from side 
to side without any semblance of a 
plan. Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
had stated the day before that 
Clarkson doesn’t beat itself and 
that the Wolverines would have 
to, but the idle passing looked like 
a half-hearted scavenger hunt for a 
slip-up from the opponents.
“I just think we’ve gotta 
simplify,” 
said 
sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg. 
“We’ve just gotta get pucks on net 
and shoot for rebounds. I think the 
rest will come.”
The 
strategy 
Blankenburg 
noted — getting the puck to the 
crease and looking for high-danger 
opportunities — is exactly how 
Michigan netted its first power 
play goal of the season.
Winning 
the 
faceoff, 
Blankenburg collected the puck 
at the blue line and lasered a pass 
across ice to a waiting Jake Slaker, 
camped at the faceoff circle. The 
senior forward cocked back his 
stick and shot the puck as it sped 
into his vicinity. The one-timer 

itself wouldn’t have gone in, but it 
gave Pastujov an opportunity to 
deflect it in.
It took eight seconds for that 
play to find success.
The opportunity arose first from 
winning the faceoff, something 
the Wolverines struggled to do all 
game long. The Golden Knights 
had won 15 of the 20 faceoffs in 
the first period alone. That in turn 
led to Michigan chasing the puck 
around, many times during their 
man advantage, and cost them 
precious seconds that could have 
been used to attack rather than 
aimlessly chasing Clarkson.
“We 
were 
terrible 
there, 
tonight. Terrible,” Pearson said. 
“Then you’re chasing the puck, you 
don’t win faceoffs, you’re chasing 
the puck all over the rink and we 
did not do a good job in that area.
“ … We gotta play with the puck, 
we want to be a puck-possession 
team instead of chasing the puck 
the entire time.”
Eight seconds showed just how 
quickly Michigan could convert on 
the power play. It took 20 seconds 
alone for the Wolverines to recover 
a puck lost on the draw during a 
power play sophomore forward 
Garrett Van Wyhe drew in the 
second period on Saturday.
The Wolverines’ power play 
looked its best when the players 
initiated the attack by bringing 
the puck near the net, whether by 
shot or stick-work, and pursuing 
the opportunity in “hard ice” — a 
term Pearson coined to describe 
the gritty play around the net.
“A shot off a pad almost 
turned into a goal off a rebound,” 
Blankenburg. “So I think we’ll 
keep working on that this week.”
It’s a point of emphasis that 
Pastujov agrees the team should 
work on. The team averaged 4.2 
power plays last season. It’s already 
drawn 12 in two games this season.
“I think we are going to be 
drawing a lot more penalties,” 
Pastujov said. “We can capitalize 
on a lot more of those chances.”
And if Michigan wants any 
chance of winning, it’ll have to.

Michigan soars to top of Big Ten

Sarah 
Stratigakis 
passed 
the ball across the pitch to her 
right, where her teammate was 
open for the finish. Sophomore 
midfielder Raleigh Loughman 
shot and found the bottom of the 
net for the first of the Michigan 
women’s soccer team’s four 
goals against Illinois. For the 
second 
consecutive 
game, 
the Wolverines scored four 
times. This time, the offensive 
barrage came late in the game, 
with two goals in the final 10 
minutes.
With their second straight 
4-1 victory and seventh win 
in their last 10 games, the 
Wolverines (11-3-1 overall, 6-1-1 
Big Ten) have caught fire with 
just three games left in the 
season.
Loughman, 
whose 
performance 
against 
the 
Fighting Illini helped her earn 
Big Ten Offensive Player of the 
Week honors, scored on both 
of her shots on goal and added 
an assist on a second-half goal 
by freshman forward Danielle 
Wolfe.
Wolfe, 
who 
was 
named 
the Big Ten Freshman of the 
Week as a result of her scoring 
outburst 
against 
Illinois, 
scored her first goal since the 
Wolverines’ 
opener 
against 
Marshall on August 22. In 32 
minutes off the bench, Wolfe 

scored twice on five shots, 
including a goal in the 88th 
minute that all but sealed a 
victory for Michigan. 
“It’s really great for us when 
we have Raleigh score two 
goals and also have a freshman 
in Danielle that can score off 
the 
bench,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein.
Thanks 
to 
the 
pair 
of 
multi-goal 
performances, 
the Wolverines 
have 
advanced 
into first place 
in the Big Ten, 
one point above 
Wisconsin, 
which 
is 
currently 
undefeated 
in 
conference play. 
At this point in the season, 
Michigan and Wisconsin, with 
19 and 18 points, respectively, 
are a step ahead of the rest of 
the conference, with the next 
two teams, Iowa and Penn 
State, having only 15 points 
each. 
Consequently, both teams 
appear to be locks for a top-
four seed in the Big Ten 
Tournament, which would give 
them 
home-field 
advantage 
through the quarterfinal and 
potentially semifinal and final 
rounds, if the Wolverines make 
it that far.
“We 
(might) 
need 
some 

help,” Klein said. “But it’s 
certainly something we want in 
the end.”
Winning 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament is Michigan’s most 
surefire route to the NCAA 
Women’s Soccer Tournament, 
as doing so would earn them 
an automatic bid, but it’s a 
tough task. The Wolverines 
haven’t 
won 
the tournament 
since the 1999-
2000 season.
This year has 
been a breakout 
season 
for 
Michigan, 
which currently 
sits at No. 19 
spot in the most 
recent 
United 
Soccer Coaches 
Poll. 
The 
Wolverines will finish with at 
least 11 wins for the first time 
since 2015 and have just one 
loss in conference play — a 2-0 
loss at the hands of Wisconsin, 
currently ranked No. 10 in the 
aforementioned poll. 
As a result, the team will 
almost 
surely 
receive 
an 
at-large bid — even if they fail 
to win the Big Ten Tournament 
— and return to the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
in four years. 
Friday 
night’s 
offensive 
output from Loughman and 
Wolfe move the Michigan one 
step closer to that goal.
