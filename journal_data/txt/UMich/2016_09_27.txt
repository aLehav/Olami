Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

emphasized several concerns 
with the city’s plans for a 
new Amtrak station during 
two public meetings Monday 
evening.

The city hosted the public 

meetings 
to 
discuss 
the 

recently released Alternatives 
Analysis 
Report, 
which 

suggested four possible sites 
for the new train station 
— three of which reside on 
Depot Street and the fourth 
on Fuller Road. The locations 
were chosen based on several 
criteria, such as ample parking 
space and access areas for 
buses and taxis. Plans for the 
new train station have been in 
progress since 2012 to relocate 
the current station to a more 
accessible location. 

The meeting began with a 

presentation 
from 
AECOM, 

the firm in charge of the 
project, led by AECOM Project 
Manager Robert Gorski, who 
gave a brief overview of the 
four potential sites.

Gorski explained that all 

First-Generation 
College 

Students 
@ 
Michigan, 
a 

student 
group 
that 
focuses 

on recognizing and resolving 
the needs of first-generation 
students, held a welcome dinner 
for about 100 first-generation 
University of Michigan students 
Monday evening.

First-generation 
students, 

defined by the University as 
students whose parents have 
never attended and/or graduated 
from college, make up 13 percent 
of the undergraduate and 18 
percent of the graduate student 
population, which is almost 
6,500 students combined.

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, called first-generation 
students 
“trailblazers” 
who 

lead the way for future first-
generation prospective students, 
during remarks at the event.

Sociology lecturer Dwight 

Lang 
has 
advised 
First-

Generation 
College 
Students 

@ Michigan for the past eight 
years and was a first-generation 
student himself. During the 
dinner, he said first-generation 
students 
often 
face 
several 

unique 
challenges, 
such 
as 

feeling marginalized or invisible.

“(First-generation 
students) 

sometimes feel like they haven’t 
had the same set of experiences 
as privileged students had,” 
Lang said. “Maybe they haven’t 
had AP classes in high school, 

maybe they haven’t traveled to 
Europe or Asia before coming to 
college.”

LSA senior Logan Meyer, 

president of First-Generation 
College Students @ Michigan, 
echoed Lang and said his desire 
to find a community motivated 
him to join and be active in the 
organization.

“My first year was absolutely 

terrible — I hated every single 
second of it,” Meyer said. “I was 
not close to my roommate, I felt 

constantly intimidated by other 
students and I felt dumb. And 
here I stand four years later, as a 
president of the first group that I 
joined in college.”

LSA junior Camille Cu, who is 

an international first-generation 
student and a transfer student 
from Washtenaw Community 
College, said she was forced to be 
self-sufficient and independent 
because her parents could not 
help her prepare for college in 
the United States.

“I had to do all the research 

by myself about what college to 
go to and what major I should 
choose,” Cu said. “Also, I had to 
prepare coming to the U.S. by 
myself.”

Lang 
said 
first-generation 

students 
exhibit 
two 
main 

strengths that are not usually 
present in other students — risk-
taking and crossing boundaries. 
He said these skills could help 
first-generation students succeed 

The first presidential debate 

drew significant interest on 
campus Monday night, with 
watch parties hosted by several 
organizations 
including 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

College Democrats and College 
Republicans chapters.

Political Science Prof. Robert 

Mickey 
hosted 
a 
viewing 

party in Angell Hall for his 
American 
Political 
Science 

class, and spoke afterward 
about how presidential debates 
usually don’t play a huge role 
in determining the outcome of 
the election. However, Mickey 
said this election cycle might be 

different. 

“Debates don’t matter as 

much as we would think they 
do, but I think this is maybe a 
race that’s so strange that the 
past might not be a good guide,” 
Mickey said.

Monday’s debate focused on 

a wide range of topics, including 
national security, race relations 
and 
recent 
controversies 

surrounding both candidates’ 
experiences.

Throughout, 
Democratic 

presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton touted policies more 
than her opponent, Republican 
presidential nominee Donald 
Trump. Several issues received 
extended attention, including 
creating 
jobs, 
reforming 

At 
the 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on Undergraduate 
Affairs meeting on Monday, 
University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack 
expressed 
concern 

after racist posters were found 
in University buildings and on 
campus that morning, while 
also noting the importance of 
free speech on campus.

Though she said she was 

disappointed with the posters, 
saying, “I would describe them 
as white supremacist or racist 
posters,” Pollack added she 
supports University policy on 
free speech regarding whether 
tehy can be removed.

“Consistent with our policy 

for posting, whenever they are 
on buildings, we can remove 
them,” Pollack said. “If they are 
on kiosks, they are protected 
by free speech, as they should 
be. Not only do we have a 
constitutional 
obligation 
to 

allow all speech no matter how 
heinous, but if you’re going to 
stand by the First Amendment, 
you’re going to stand by the 
First Amendment. But what

LSA senior and NAACP chapter president Travis Jones speaks at the Black Lives Matter protest Monday night at the Fishbowl.

More 
than 
200 
students 

gathered in Angell Hall at the 
University of Michigan for an 
hour Monday afternoon to protest 
racially charged posters found 

hanging in University buildings 
and around campus earlier in the 
day.

The posters included comments 

such as “reasons why women 
shouldn’t date Black men” and 
explanations of “race differences 
in intelligence.”

The protest began with a group 

of about 30 students in the Diag, 

growing to its full size of 200 as the 
group marched to the Fishbowl in 
Angell Hall. Upon entering the 
building, students and attendees 
chanted, “No justice, no peace.” 
The 
demonstration 
grew 
in 

numbers as students working in 
the Fishbowl stood up to join the 
group.

criminal 
justice 
and 
earlier 

comments from Trump about 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

birthplace.

Early in the debate, Trump 

charged that Clinton supported 
policies that caused Americans 
to lose jobs to other countries, 
citing the North American Free 
Trade Agreement as one example 
and saying his plan would bring 
jobs back.

“The first thing you do is 

don’t let the jobs leave,” he said. 
“The companies are leaving. I 
could name, I mean, there are 
thousands 
of 
them. 
They’re 

leaving, and they’re leaving in 
bigger numbers than ever.”

In response, Clinton charged 

that Trump’s plan was not 
practical and would increase the 
national deficit.

“Independent experts have 

looked at what I’ve proposed 
and looked at what Donald’s 
proposed,” 
she 
said. 
“And 

basically they’ve said this, that 
if his tax plan, which would 
blow up the debt by over $5 
trillion and would in some 
instances disadvantage middle-
class families compared to the 
wealthy, were to go into effect, 
we would lose 3.5 million jobs”

Speaking 
to 
the 
criminal 

justice system, Clinton stressed 
the necessity of working to 
remove racial biases in dialogues 
and the justice system. Trump, in 
contrast, repeatedly emphasized 
the need for “law and order” and 
praised “stop and frisk” policies 
which were banned in New York 
in part due to claims of racial 
discrimination.

Clinton was the only candidate 

to bring up the issue of higher 
education reform and college 
debt, briefly calling for debt-free 
higher education reform and 
allowing students to refinance 
their existing loans at lower 
rates.

Mickey 
said 
compared 
to 

presidential debates from the 
1980s to now, he was shocked by 
how argumentative this one was.

“This was nuts compared 

to all of those — so much more 
combative, 
interrupting 
and 

crazy,” Mickey said early on. “I 
can’t believe we have another 
three hours.”

Several 
specific 
moments 

throughout the debate drew 
big reactions from the studio 
audience and were noticeably 
heated, including a discussion 
over Trump’s previous comments 
about 
Obama’s 
birthplace. 

Though Obama produced his 
birth certificate several years 
ago, Trump has raised questions 
about the president’s place of 
birth as recently as January.

In response to a question from 

moderator and NBC Nightly 
News host Lester Holt about 
the comments, Trump said he 
had not started the conversation 
around 
Obama’s 
birthplace, 

instead saying Clinton’s team 
had during the 2008 election. 
Rather, he said, he had finished 
the debate around it. This claim, 
which Trump has said several 
times on the campaign trail, has 
been rated as false by multiple 
fact-checking organizations.

“I think I did a great job and 

a great service not only for the 
country but even for the president 
in getting him to produce his 
birth certificate,” Trump said.

Speaking directly afterward, 

Clinton pressed Trump on his 
recent comments about Obama’s 
place of birth, calling the idea 
that the president wasn’t born in 
the U.S. a racist lie.

“The birther lie was a very 

hurtful one,” she said. “And you 
know, Barack Obama is a man 
of great dignity. And I could tell 
how much it bothered him and 
annoyed him.”

In terms of the candidates’ 

performances, 
Mickey 
said 

Clinton 
performed 
pretty 

much as expected. However, 
he said Trump’s performance 
and outspoken demeanor on 
the national stage somewhat 
surprised him.

“I thought Trump was going 

to have more self-control than he 
displayed. I thought he was going 
to be more relaxed and even-
keeled,” Mickey said.

On Twitter, 
The 

Michigan 
Daily 

hosted a series of informal polls 
throughout the debate, open to 
anyone with a Twitter account. 
Respondents 
overwhelmingly 

responded saying they believed 
Democratic 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton had won the debate.

Along 
with 
nonpartisan 

viewing parties, the debate also 
sparked significant interest from 
students across the political 
spectrum on campus.

Roughly 300 students attended 

a presidential debate watch party 
in Angell Hall sponsored by Fox 
News, along with the Young 
Americans for Freedom, College 
Republicans, 
The 
Michigan 

Review and Young Americans for 
Liberty, who were coordinators 
of the event.

“Fox 
News 
is 
sponsoring 

debate watch parties all across 
the country and we’re one of 
the groups that co-sponsored 
the event,” said LSA senior 
Grant Strobl, chairman of the 
University’s Young Americans 
for Freedom chapter. “We were 
excited to offer a bipartisan 

forum for students to watch the 
debate.”

Strobl said groups from all 

ends of the political spectrum 
were invited to the viewing 
party to foster a bipartisan 
environment, adding that an 
invitation was extended to the 
College Democrats, though they 
respectfully declined

“It’s OK to listen to other 

viewpoints and listen to them 
respectfully,” Strobl said. “We’re 
all fellow Wolverines — we 
can disagree sometimes and 
sometimes 
disagreeing 
isn’t 

easy, but in order to learn it’s 
necessary.”

In the midst of the viewing 

party, a group of about 10 
protesters entered the room, 
banging on drums and cymbals. 
The motivation of the protest was 
unclear.

LSA senior Nick Murray was in 

the room to witness the protest, 
but said he was also involved 
in a physical altercation with 
protesters in the hall outside of 
the viewing.

“They were throwing cymbals,

John Hudak, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, discusses 
marijuana policy in the United States Monday at the Ford School of 
Public Policy.

M ARIJ UANA POLICY

Three hundred Business stu-

dents, faculty and staff wore all 
black and posed for a photo in 
the Ross School of Business Win-
ter Garden lobby on Monday in 
response to several recent shoot-
ings of Black men by police nation-
wide.

The demonstration, which was 

organized by the Black Business 
Students Association in partner-
ship with the Ross Student Gov-
ernment Association, aimed to 
start a conversation among stu-
dents of the Business School and 
the greater University of Michi-
gan community about supporting 
students of color in the months to 
come. It focused on several recent 
incidents, including the deaths of 
Terence Crutcher of Oklahoma 
and Keith Scott of North Carolina.

Marissa 
Smith, 
second-year 

Business student and president of 
BBSA, said she saw this event as 
the start of the conversation, not 

the end of it.

“This demonstration is not 

going to do anything to solve sys-
temic racism, but we see this as a 
step one. We want to raise aware-
ness within the Ross community 
of the magnitude of this issue and 
gather allies to make them feel 
empowered,” she said.

Smith said the BBSA chose to 

do a “Black Out” demonstration, 
instead of holding a protest or 
march, to add to a already long list 
of schools across the country dis-
playing their support in a similar 
manner.

“We primarily decided to do a 

‘Black Out’ to show solidarity with 
other business schools across the 
country” Smith said. “Ross was 
actually the first school to do this. 
We did this in 2014 and unfortu-
nately, we’re still having similar 
issues so we wanted to bring it back 
and show how united the Ross 
community can be two years later.”

Terence Crutcher, 40, was 

stunned with a Taser first by Tulsa 
police officer Tyler Turnbough 

and then fatally shot by Offi-
cer Betty Shelby on Sept. 16. In a 
video released by the Tulsa Police 
Department, four police officers 
run up to Crutcher, who is walking 
toward his car with his hands up. 
After the altercation, the depart-
ment reported that Crutcher was 
unarmed. According to Shelby’s 
lawyer, Shelby suspected Crutch-
er of having a weapon and acting 
erratically.

In the same week, Keith Scott 

of Charlotte, N.C. was shot exit-
ing his car and backing away from 
it. Charlotte police claimed Scott 
was in possession of a handgun 
and marijuana. According to the 
Washington Post, the body camera 
was not activated until after Scott 
had been shot, which is a violation 
of the department’s policy.

The killings of Crutcher and 

Scott have sparked a series pro-
tests in their respective cities and 
across the country, including at the 
University. Students protested the 
shootings in front of the Michigan 
Union Saturday with signs saying 
“Not One More” and “Say Their 
Names.”

Business senior Holly Price, 

who is white, participated in the 
photo as an ally because she want-
ed to show her fellow classmates 
that there is a large support group 
at the Business School.

“I think the demonstration 

helps the students of color under-
stand who some of their stronger 
supporters are so that they know 
who they can turn to for support,” 
Price said. “It will continue to raise 
awareness and help spark conver-
sations so that maybe change can 
be affected long-term by people 
having some of these tough conver-
sations sooner rather than later.”

Marketing Prof. David Wooten, 

the school’s director for Diversity 
and Inclusion, attended the event 
and said he was pleased to see peo-
ple of all ethnicities in attendance.

“We are concerned about mak-

ing a difference, in addition to 
making a dollar, over here in Ross,” 
said Wooten. “To me, there was 
a pretty strong show of solidar-
ity. We had quite a bit of diversity

though he, along with Provost 
Martha Pollack, Harper and Rob 
Sellers, vice provost for equity, 
inclusion and academic affairs, 
released a statement condemning 
the posters this morning.

School 
of 
Social 
Work 

graduate 
student 
Lawrielle 

West, an organizer of the protest, 
said the demonstration was in 
response to what she said was 
an inadequate response from the 
administration.

“When I saw that apology 

from...administration, I wasn’t 
comforted,” she said. “I want to 
be acknowledged as a real person 
who pays money to this school...
we’re not going to get anything 
done until we disturb the peace.”

LSA junior Lakyrra McGee, 

another organizer, called for an 
address from Schlissel and also 
criticized his focus on a long-term 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
strategic plan as a solution to 
campus 
climate 
issues. 
The 

plan, which Schlissel began the 
process for last year and is set 

to be released October 6, uses 
the year 2025 as a benchmark to 
evaluate potential success. Many 
students, however, urged for 
more immediate options.

“It’s possible to do both,” 

Magee said, referring to the 
University addressing current 
events and the 5-year DEI plan. 
“But they’re not doing it. We 
want Schlissel to address us… 
about 2017, not 2025,” she said.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said Schlissel did not 
attend the event because he is 
out of town.

Protesters chanted “Why wait 

for 2025, will I even be alive?” 
on the Diag and also held signs 
reading “We Want More than 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion”

West 
and 
other 
speakers 

during the event also questioned 
the importance of free speech 
when that speech is threatening 
to entire student demographics.

“They’re protecting freedom 

of speech, but what about my 
safety?” West asked. 

In their statement Monday, 

the administration condemned 
the posters and said they did not 
consider them protected free 
speech, but did not state whether 

the University would act to 
take them down. Fitzgerald 
said Monday afternoon that the 
University would take down 
posters on campus buildings, 
but would not remove posters 
in posting kisoks, such as the 
Mason Hall posting wall.

Many of the flyers distributed 

featured 
an 
Alt-Right 
logo, 

though it remains unclear if the 
group has an affiliate branch on 
campus.

Kinesiology 
senior 
D’kari 

Wilson, who also spoke during 
the 
rally, 
said 
the 
posters 

demonstrated a need to change 
campus climate. 

“You don’t understand my 

frustration or my pain,” Wilson 
said. “Go educate someone that 
looks like you. If you don’t do 
something, it’s going to manifest 
itself … and it manifested itself 
today in the postings.”

Other recent racially charged 

incidents 
came 
up 
during 

the protest, including racist 
graffiti discovered at Eastern 
Michigan University last week, 
a demonstration by Michigan 
football players on Sunday and 
a number of instances of police 
brutality sparking controversy 

around the nation.

Magee 
highlighted 
the 

emotional toll of current events 
on Black students, many of whom 
voiced the need to take time off 
from their academic schedules.

“We want faculty and staff 

to address us too, but not 
necessarily 
by 
facilitating 

discussions,” she said. “They 
need to realize students need 
time and they need space to deal 
with things.” 

LSA sophomore Timberlee 

Whiteus 
agreed, 
and 
called 

out 
non-Black 
students 
for 

common insensitive actions and 
microaggressions.

“I get distracted when y’all are 

handing out bullshit on the Diag 
about my race, and I’m tired,” she 
said. “You want to be Black until 
it’s time to be Black.” 

History Prof. Martha Jones, 

who attended the protest, said 
she believes this incident not 
only affects the Black campus 
community, but also the overall 
student body.

“It seems to me the white 

students have an interest, more 
so than any of us perhaps, 
today in thinking critically and 
responding to people who are 

attempting to provoke them and 
to define their identities and to 
position them as against African 
American students for example,” 
Jones said.

Jones said it is crucial for 

instances such as these to be 
looked at from the perspective of 
allowing freedom of speech and 
expression, but with additional 
consideration to the value of 
safety for all members of the 
University community.

“In my view, it is an attempt 

to attack the very fabric of what 
higher education might be, could 
be, should be, and the residential 
experience,” Jones said. “These 
are the tactics of people who 
are not only looking to attack 
groups of students within our 
community but are looking to, 
in fact, undercut and destroy our 
community.”

After the event, administrators 

such as Martin spoke briefly with 
student organizers. Martin did 
not speak at length to organizers 
assembled after the event, but 
voiced agreement with student 
motivations.

“Yes, 
I 
would 
support 

this protest,” he said to the 
organizers.

you have to do then is loudly 
make known your abhorrence 
of this.”

Kisoks refer to areas where 

posters can be hung, such as 
the posting wall in Mason 
Hall. 

Pollack also said she worries 

about younger students who 
have only been on campus for 
a few weeks.

“I 
would 
always 
be 

concerned, but I’m particularly 
concerned because it is the 
start of the new academic 
year, we have young students 
here, very young, away from 
home for the first time,” she 
said.

Silke-Maria 
Weineck, 

chair of the Department of 
Comparative Literature and 
SACUA 
member, 
suggested 

creating 
SACUA-sponsored 

posters to potentially cover 
the 
inappropriate 
posters 

as a solution that would not 
infringe on free speech.

Members 
of 
SACUA 

also discussed releasing a 
statement in response to these 
remarks; but, not all members 
were in agreement about what 
type of statement should be 
released.

Tom 
Schneider, 
director 

of the Faculty Senate Office, 
said he was uncertain about 
releasing the statement or 
creating posters, especially 
depending 
on 
whether 
or 

not University faculty were 
emailed ahead of time.

“I’m hesitant to do that for 

every posting of an unsavory 
character,” Schneider said.

Pollack tied the incident 

to the upcoming release of 
the 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Inclusion strategic plan on 
Oct. 
6, 
a 
University-wide 

effort a year in the making 
which 
aims 
to 
increase 

campus diversity and climate.

In addition to discussing 

campus 
climate, 
Pollack 

also touched on a number 
of 
strategies 
to 
maintain 

sustainability efforts already 
present on campus, which 
included expanding on the 
current School of Natural 
Resources and Environment.

“I think by and large this 

is going to be a way of the 
University putting its stake 
in the ground and saying yes, 
we can be a leader in this field 
and we can be a leader in a way 
that many other universities 
can’t be, precisely because of 
our breadth,” Pollack said.

Shortly after Pollack left the 

meeting, the group went into 
executive session, which press 
is barred from attending.

in spite of their backgrounds and 
previous experiences.

“(First-generation 
students) 

have 
taken 
significant 
risks 

coming here, coming to a new 
place that they are not familiar 
with — a middle-class, upper-
middle-class college,” Lang said. 
“They feel comfortable crossing 
boundaries and getting to know 
people who grew up in very 
different circumstances.”

Cu said attending the dinner 

helped her realize other first-
generation 
students 
also 

experienced the problems she 
has been experiencing, such 
as feeling like she had no one 
to talk to. She added that the 
first-generation students should 
believe in their strength.

“I just want to say ‘just be 

proud of yourself,’ ” Cu said. “I 
am the first one in my family to 
go to college and I’m so proud of 
myself for that. Everyone’s really 
strong, and it’s good to have a 
group of people to support you.”

DINNER

four sites would have similar 
features, such as new traffic 
lights, buses and the need 
to 
acquire 
property 
from 

DTE, but the Fuller station 
would require a taller parking 
structure 
than 
the 
three 

other proposed Depot Street 
locations.

After 
the 
presentation, 

Gorski 
opened 
the 
floor 

to 
questions 
along 
with 

Eli 
Cooper, 
Ann 
Arbor 

transportation 
manager. 

Members of the public asked 
about several aspects of the 
project, including the timeline 
for it and when the station 
would open.

Cooper stressed that there 

is currently no way to properly 
estimate 
an 
opening 
date 

due to a number of unknown 
variables, such as the timeline 
for submitting and receiving 
authorization from the federal 
government for funding.

Many 
members 
of 
the 

public present also expressed 
concern that the expected 
cost of each proposed site 
has not been considering in 
the narrowing down process. 
Cooper and Gorski said cost is 
not a concern at this current 
stage of planning.

“The cost for developing the 

project element is irrelevant 
for the phase we are in now,” 
Cooper said.

Cooper 
and 
Gorski, 
as 

well as officials from the 
Federal Railroad Association, 
who were not available for 
comment, also addressed the 
public’s concern over potential 
repurposing of park land and 
the Gandy Dancer restaurant 
on Depot Street.

Two of the four possible 

station designs are both at the 
location of the current Amtrak 
station on Depot Street. One 
of the design options is for an 
elevated station. The other is 
for a ground level station north 
of the tracks.

Several 
members 
of 
the 

public also spoke during the 
meeting to share what site they 
found most desireable. Eric 
Lipson, Ann Arbor citizen and 
former member of the Planning 
Commission, spoke in favor 
of one of the Depot Street 
locations, detailing how he 
believes Ann Arbor has grown 
out of the original location on 
Depot Street in Gandy Dancer.

Other arguments were made 

in favor of the Fuller location 
because of its potential to 
support a link to commuter 
rail.

Several 
attendees 
also 

commented on the planning 
process itself. William Allen 
Simpson, a former Ann Arbor 
citizen, told officials he was 
happy the city and Federal Rail 
Association would be doing a 
comprehensive environmental 
report before moving forward.

“All the things that people 

are saying — this site is better 
for this or that — that’s what 
the environmental analysis is 
all about,” Simpson said.

in terms of students from different 
schools, colleges and different eth-
nic groups.”

Along with black outfits, par-

ticipants in the photo wore white 
nametags with the phrase “#Ross-
4Change” on them. Jerry Won, a 
Business graduate student and pres-
ident of SGA, said he believes the 
hashtag is more than just a Twitter 
convention.

“Our hashtag ‘#Ross4Change’ 

embodies that spirit of ‘We’re doing 
this to make a positive change,’ ” 
Won said. “That can be interpreted 

in a number of different ways but 
ultimately, we want people to feel 
safe. We want there not to be trag-
edies like this going forward.”

Many Business administrators 

and faculty also attended the event 
alongside students. Business School 
Dean Scott DeRue, who was in 
attendance, said he wanted to sup-
port both the movement and the 
students behind it.

“At Ross, we aspire to develop 

leaders who make a positive dif-
ference in the world,” DeRue said. 
“To me, it’s leaders that bring 
people together despite forces that 
may try and draw us apart — that 
is part of making that positive dif-
ference. I wanted to be here and 

support our students in being lead-
ers who make a positive difference 
and bring people together around 
issues that are critically important 
to our society.”

Wooten echoed DeRue’s senti-

ments, adding that the faculty also 
wanted to demonstrate their sup-
port.

“This was largely a student-run, 

student-planned event and they 
brought it to our attention and as 
leaders of this school, we wanted to 
show our support for their event,” 
Wooten said.

Business junior Justin Chan, a 

demonstration participant, said he 
saw the event as a display of unity 
in times of struggle.

“It kind of showed how the Ross 

community can come together 
at times when very controversial 
issues such as race and ethnicity 
are dividing the country especially 
in an election year,” Chan said. “I 
think it kind of showed how diverse 
Michigan is, as well as Ross.”

In the coming months, BBSA 

plans to host several events where 
diverse groups can engage in con-
structive dialogue about recent 
events and how the community 
can support one another.

“We want to make it very wel-

coming, non-confrontational, just 
to help teach people about some of 
the issues at hand,” said Smith.

making noise, one of them threw 
a cymbal on the ground and I 
picked it up. I came outside and 
they followed me,” Murray said.

Strobl said he was disappointed 

that some students felt the need 
protest in such a disruptive 
manner.

“Students have the right to 

listen to freedom of speech as 
projected on the screen,” Strobl 
said. “I respect a student’s right 
to protest, but disrupting other 
people’s right to listen to the 
views of our two presidential 
candidates is not OK.”

LSA 
senior 
Casey 

VanderWeide, 
a 
member 
of 

the College Republicans, said 
a presidential debate in this 
election cycle could finally allow 
voters to see the candidates in a 
new and more raw light.

“I 
think 
especially 
with 

these two candidates who are 
so 
polarizing, 
these 
debates 

will actually show people some 
substance,” VanderWeide said. 
“We haven’t really been seeing 
that a lot and with the news 
coverage it’s just been back and 
forth with bad characteristics.”

Citing 
a 
poll 
that 
was 

conducted among the audience 
before the debate, Strobl said 

most students at the debate watch 
party originally believed Trump 
would win, but by the end of the 
debate it seemed as if Clinton had 
the slight advantage.

Engineering 
junior 
Alex 

Knecht said he expected Trump 
to perform better, but believed 
Clinton had won by the end.

“Trump was definitely more 

aggressive, but I think Clinton 
ended up winning the debate,” 
Knecht said. “Trump was kind 
of just echoing what Hillary was 
saying and I don’t think (Trump) 
enforced his points well enough.”

The College Democrats and 

Students for Hillary also hosted a 
watch party at Weill Hall, which 
ran out of chairs to seat students, 
many of whom stood in the back 
or sat on the floor. Throughout 
the debate, students in the room 
cheered at various statements by 
Clinton and booed at statements 
from Trump.

College 
Democrats 
Chair 

Collin Kelly, an LSA junior, said 
he hoped the watch party would 
increase 
enthusiasm 
for 
the 

Clinton campaign and encourage 
the student vote.

“We just wanted to make sure 

that students learn that this is the 
best place to get together to learn 
— as we all obviously saw — why 
Hillary Clinton is the best choice 
to lead our country as the next 
president,” he said. “We wanted 

to make sure that students were 
energized and could be mobilized 
to get out to vote in such strong 
numbers, because as we all know 
when students vote, Democrats 
win.”

On 
campus, 
the 
first 

Michigan Daily election survey 
last week showed that an 
overwhelming majority of a 
sample of students supported 
Clinton.

Prior to the start of the 

debate, students shared what 
they believed were the most 
important 
issues, 
citing 

immigration, higher education 
reform, health care and race 
relations.

Engineering 
freshman 

Kelsey Toporski said she hoped 
the candidates would discuss 
immigration 
policy 
because 

she comes from a town near 
the Southern border of the 
United States and has seen the 
effects of policy on the lives of 
immigrants firsthand.

“We come from a small town 

and there is a lot of Mexican 
families,” she said. “And I know 
that if something happens then 
their families could be torn 
apart, and I don’t want any of 
that to happen to my friends.”

Following 
the 
debate, 

students at the watch party 
overwhelmingly 
felt 
that 

Clinton had won the debate. 

However, students had mixed 
reactions about the implications 
of it on the election as a whole.

LSA junior Brendan Schroder 

said he is afraid Trump may 
succeed in winning the White 
House if he continues to receive 
support after the debate.

“My heart rate over the 

whole debate because of Donald 
Trump was over 100 beats per 
minute,” he said. “I was that 
stressed out. I just couldn’t 
take it … This election could be 
heading in a direction where 
Trump could be the president.”

FROM THE DAILY

We stand with communities of color
E

arly yesterday morning students discovered three different types of 
fliers in Haven and Mason Halls that advocated racist viewpoints 
such as “Why white women shouldn’t date black men,” among 

other ridiculous and incendiary statements. This detestable act of hate 
speech follows the recent startling episode of racist graffiti spray-painted 
on the campus of Eastern Michigan University. Racial epithets and calls 
for Black Americans to “leave” were emblazoned on the side of an EMU 
building, causing community members and students to march in the streets 
of Ypsilanti. These events, following years of heightened racial tension and 
increased focus on race relations on our campus and beyond, are alarming 
to say the least. As peers together in the struggle for diversity and inclusion, 
we categorically denounce these racist pieces of speech.

Almost 
immediately, 

on 
Monday, 
University 
of 

Michigan officials condemned 
the fliers. University President 
Mark 
Schlissel, 
University 

Provost 
Martha 
Pollack, 

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life and 
Rob Sellers, vice provost for 
equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, wrote an open letter to 
students noting that though 

protecting 
free 
speech 
is 

paramount to the University, 
the fliers were unacceptable 
and not consistent with the 
University’s values. LSA Dean 
Andrew D. Martin echoed 
these sentiments along with 
Carol Fierke, dean of Rackham 
Graduate School. More than 200 
students also spoke out against 
the fliers, staging a protest in 
Haven and Mason Halls.

As an Editorial Staff, we join 

the 
administration, 
faculty 

and 
hundreds 
of 
students 

condemning 
the 
posting 
of 

these appalling, racist posters. 
We support and agree with 
the 
below 
statement 
from 

Michigan in Color editors, and 
we stand in solidarity with all 
who have been affected by the 
racist statements.

Where in the world was Lester Holt?

BRETT GRAHAM | COLUMN

L

ast August, 10 men took 
the stage in Cleveland 
in front of an audience 

of 24 million viewers, kicking 
off the Republican primary. It 
was reality television. There 
was a close-up on the star of the 
show and, of course, 
the 
big 
question, 

asked by Bret Baier 
with baited breath: 
Was anyone on stage 
unwilling to pledge, 
without reservation, 
to 
support 
the 

Republican nominee, 
no 
matter 
who 

that may be, and 
not 
launch 
an 

independent bid for 
president? 
Donald 

Trump, center stage, raised 
his hand with a grin. Starting 
with that moment, the media 
has failed the American public 
when it comes to covering 
the Republican nominee for 
president. Last night, Lester 
Holt continued that failure.

Ignore the hundreds of hours 

of phone interviews Trump has 
given, or how roundtables about 
his most recent inflammatory, 
outrageous 
comments 
have 

monopolized airtime more so 
for him more than any other 
candidate. Ignore the fact that 
analysts frequently compare 
Mr. Trump’s not-yet-released 
tax returns to Clinton’s emails, 
which have been investigated by 
a House Oversight Committee 
and the FBI in a ludicrous 
pursuit 
of 
being 
“biased 

towards fairness.” Ignore the 
fact that scrutiny has taken 
a backseat to headlines and 
ratings. Ignore the idea that 
fact-checking 
presidential 

candidates during a debate is in 
question rather than assumed. 
Ignore everything the media 
has afforded Donald Trump to 
this point. If you can. Center in 
on the fact that for 90 minutes 
last night, we witnessed a free-
for-all.

In 
response 
to 
Clinton’s 

attack that he stood to gain 
from the housing crisis of the 
late 2000s that put millions 
of Americans in foreclosure, 
Trump 
retorted, 
“That’s 

called business, by the way.” 
In response to Clinton’s attack 
that he does not pay income 
taxes, he crowed, “That makes 
me smart.” Trump then went 
on to explain that he takes 

pride in his ability to “take 
advantage” 
of 
the 
system. 

There was no follow-up. There 
was no challenge. Only a few 
moments of dead air and then 
the next question. Lester Holt 
sat and watched. With the 

exception 
of 
one 

admonishment and 
briefly 
curtailing 

one 
of 
Trump’s 

interruptions, 
it 

was as if this were 
an 
unmoderated 

debate.

Then, there was 

a glimmer of hope. 
On 
the 
topic 
of 

stop-and-frisk, Holt 
politely 
reminded 

the 
Republican 

nominee that one of the central 
points of his law and order 
policy was unconstitutional. 
Not questionable or subject 
to scrutiny, unconstitutional. 
Trump rolled on.

The greatest sin came in the 

last half hour of the debate, 
on the topic of the Iraq War. 
Three times, Trump denied 
that he ever supported the 
conflict (a denial that has been 
rated false by several watchdog 
organizations) with three loud 
exclamations of “Wrong!” and 
the suggestion that this was 
a mainstream media lie, for 
which Secretary Clinton was 
responsible. 
His 
evidence? 

Call 
Sean 
Hannity. 
Lester 

Holt 
provided 
the 
context 

for 
his 
question, 
meekly 

offering, “That question was in 
reference to your statement in 
2002.” Later, on the question 
about whether or not Clinton 
had a presidential “look” (a 
ridiculous question in its own 
right), Holt was silenced by 
a condescending “Hold on. 
You asked me a question. Did 
you ask me a question?” from 
Trump.

Donald Trump’s candidacy 

is 
a 
media 
and 
cultural 

phenomenon. Last night, rather 
than take the opportunity to 
rein in rhetoric and bring a tone 
of seriousness to this election, 
Lester Holt let Trump off the 
leash. Reminiscent of the nearly 
absent Jim Lehrer from 2012, it 
was often easy to forget that a 
moderator was present, and not 
just because of the odd split-
screen format. Why? Because 
the millions of Americans who 
tuned in to watch last night 

would not be disappointed by 
Donald Trump on the loose. It’s 
entertaining. But entertainment 
was not in Lester Holt’s job 
description. A moderator is 
not a host on the Game Show 
Network, a moderator is a 
force to be reckoned with, a 
voice to be heard. There is a 
difference between provoking 
good discussion and provoking 
entertainment.

Last night, Hillary Clinton 

needed 
to 
be 
poised 
and 

professional. She needed to 
reconnect with voters after 
over 25 years in public life, 
demonstrate 
the 
composure 

and intelligence to be expected 
by the first woman to stand on 
the debate stage, the highest 
arena 
of 
public 
debate 
in 

American 
politics. 
On 
the 

other hand, so long as Donald 
Trump did not bring up the 
possibility of nuclear warfare, 
insult an enormous segment 
of the population like Muslims 
or Latinos or mention Rosie 
O’Donnell, there would be one 
commentator on the morning 
talk shows or the CNN post-
debate breakdown who would 
call 
him 
“disciplined” 
and 

“composed.” Clinton had to 
impress. Trump had to show 
up and act like a decent person. 
And that comes in part because 
of the expectations that the 
media has set.

By the end of the 90 minutes, 

the no-applause rule was a 
distant memory. The debate 
had become blood sport, and 
I would have preferred Jerry 
Springer floating around on 
stage 
with 
a 
microphone, 

allowing the drama to unfold, 
rather 
than 
Lester 
Holt 

twiddling his thumbs. At least 
Jerry is above board about his 
purpose.

For the sake of the American 

public and the integrity of this 
election process, a message to 
the moderators of the upcoming 
debates, 
Martha 
Raddatz, 

Anderson Cooper and Chris 
Wallace — American media 
has to be better than this. You 
are there for a reason, as a 
prosecutor for the public, with 
a singular bellwether: facts. 
Show up. Lester Holt did not, 
and, like most Americans, I am 
ready for the referee to step in.

D

ear Editorial Board,

An entire op-ed was 

written about housing 

affordability in Ann Arbor, 
ending with a strong, resolute 
statement: Housing must be 
more affordable in Ann Arbor. 
Yet there was absolutely no 
mention of our most affordable, 
successful 
and 
long-lasting 

housing option in our city! 
Cooperative housing provides 
the most affordable housing 
for residents. Members of most 
houses pay less than $600 per 
month for rent, home-cooked 
meals, utilities and Wi-Fi.

We own 19 buildings near 

campus. We are one of the 
oldest and largest cooperative 
housing organizations in the 
United States, second only 
to Berkeley. We even host a 
national cooperative housing 
conference every year in the 
Michigan Union, The NASCO 
Institute. How on Earth has 
the editorial board overlooked 
such a characteristic staple of 
Ann Arbor? How on Earth has 
this absolutely viable option 
for everyone not been brought 
forth? Housing cooperatives 
are absolutely the future. They 
are the solution.

There are even non-student 

housing 
cooperatives 
near 

campus 
(Arbor 
Vitae) 
and 

cohousing units just outside 
of Ann Arbor (Great Oak, 
Touchstone 
and 
Sunward) 

with 
equally 
affordable 

pricing. From my experience, 
almost all of Ann Arbor’s 
activists, artists and engaged 
citizens live or have lived in a 
cooperative house. They are 
cultural 
centers. 
They 
are 

political centers. 

They are the answer.

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

I

n response to the recent 
plastering 
of 
white 

supremacist 
and 
anti-

Black 
posters 
around 
our 

campus, the continued unjust 
murders of Black people at the 
hands of police in the United 
States 
and 
the 
oppressive 

systems 
that 
allow 
these 

events to occur, the Michigan 
in Color editors would like to 
issue a statement of solidarity 
with Black students, faculty 
and staff at the University of 
Michigan.

As a group that was founded 
out of a necessity to amplify 
the voices and stories of people 
of color at this University, 
Michigan in Color wants to 
emphasize that this is a space 
for you. We acknowledge the 
immensely 
harmful 
impact 

these events have had on the 
Black community, an impact 
felt even within our own staff. 
We acknowledge the pain and 
fear that comes from being 
at an institution that does 
nothing to ensure your safety, 
an institution whose empty 
words continue to miss the 
point. We will not ignore it, and 
we will not be silent.

To non-Black students of color 
and white students who ally 
themselves with the Black 
community, if we call ourselves 
allies, then we have to work to 
prove it. We do not do this by 
co-opting space and co-opting 
struggle. We do not do this by 
assuming what our Black peers 
need from us and speaking for 
them. We do this by actively 
challenging our internalization 
of 
anti-Black 
racism 
and 

rhetoric. We do this by naming 
these acts for exactly what they 
are: manifestations of a system 
that does not value Black 
bodies.

In the face of violence and 
oppression, 
silence 
speaks 

volumes about our indifference 

when it comes to confronting 
and deconstructing the anti-
Blackness 
perpetuated 
by 

our communities. We must 
continue to acknowledge the 
deeply rooted and targeted 
nature of racism against Black 
people. We must continue to 
reach out to our Black friends 
and remind them that their 
lives matter to us. While they 
take time to grieve and heal, it 
is our duty to not waste time by 
remaining silent. Show up and 
speak up.

To the perpetrators of these 
violent acts, you say, “white 
people have the right to exist.” 
Luckily for you, no one has 
ever denied that fact. You have 

never endured existing in a 
country that was founded upon 
centuries of the enslavement 
and dehumanization of people 
of your race. You have never 
faced a lifetime of violence 
and disenfranchisement. You 
have never had your humanity 
debated. Undoubtedly, you will 
argue that your right to free 
speech is being taken away by 
those who refuse to accept your 
hate speech. But your ability to 
occupy space with these words 
of aggression is proof enough 
that your autonomy has and 
always will be respected in this 
country without question.

Your hate is anonymous, but the 
Black community’s pain is not. 
It is publicly displayed, thought 
to be open for conversation and 
even debate. All the while, 
Black folks are expected to be 
silent.

But we know, through the 
current efforts of movements 
such as #BlackLivesMatter and 
#BBUM, as well as the historic 
and revolutionary resistance 
and resilience of Black students, 
faculty and staff, that Black 
folks do make their struggles 
and their experiences heard. 
Their demand to be human and 
to be valued echoes, despite 
societal silence.

We do this by 
naming these 
acts for exactly 
what they are: 

manifestations of 
a system that does 

not value Black 

bodies

Since “Parks and Recreation” 

and “Parenthood” left the air in 
2015, NBC’s lineup has been miss-
ing 
shows 
that 

carry their ban-
ners. NBC started 
programming 
more mainstream, 
plot-based content 
like the procedural 
“Chicago” 
fran-

chise and dramas 
like 
“Blindspot” 

and “The Black-
list,” 
but 
were 

missing shows that were warm, 
sweet and incredibly enjoyable to 
watch on a weekly basis. It took 
18 months, but NBC might have 
found something to fill those holes 
in their lineup with “This is Us.” 
The pilot episode contains char-
acter development and emotional 
payoff that suggest a show that 
will effectively go for the jugular 
each week, and will only become 
more effective as time goes on.

“This is Us” follows a few dif-

ferent groups of people as they 
move through their lives. There’s 
Jack (Milo Ventimiglia, “Heroes”) 
and Rebecca (Mandy Moore, 
“Tangled”), who are about to 
become parents as Rebecca gives 
birth in the first episode; Kate 
(Chrissy Metz, “American Hor-
ror Story”), an overweight woman 
who starts to attend a weight loss 
support group where she meets 
Toby (Chris Sullivan, “Stranger 
Things”), an overweight man who 
she begins dating; Kate’s brother 
Kevin (Justin Hartley, “Small-
ville”), an actor who stars on a 
multi-cam sitcom; and Randall 
(newly anointed Emmy Award 
Winner Sterling K. Brown, “The 

People vs. OJ Simpson”), a success-
ful professional who tracks down 
his biological father.

These stories are simple at the 

surface, but “This is Us” excel-
lently digs into them. The drama 

isn’t necessarily for 
plot 
significance; 

instead, it’s focused 
on developing its 
characters. 
That’s 

what’s most suc-
cessful in this pilot. 
Until the last few 
minutes, the hour 
is about getting to 
know the people 
who the show will 

be following, setting up what they 
need to do to grow on a week-to-
week basis. It’s a classic character-
focused format, and it’s something 
that’s been sorely missing from 
NBC’s lineup.

Much like “Parenthood,” “This 

is Us” goes for the emotional 
jugular in its emotional payoffs. 
Each story ends with some sort of 
moment where the music swells 
and the characters share some sort 
of “moment.” Whether it’s Jack and 
his wife’s elderly OBGYN (Gerald 
McRaney, “House of Cards”) hav-
ing a heartfelt conversation as the 
doctor tells Jack about what hap-
pened during the birth, or Ran-
dall bringing home his biological 
father to meet his grandkids, the 
last ten minutes are filled with 
effectively treacly scenes. There is 
an element of emotional manipu-
lation; because this is only the first 
episode, and I’ve only spent 40 
minutes with these characters, it’s 
hard to care for them as strongly 
as I did for the Bravermans toward 
the end of “Parenthood,” which is 
how the show seems to expect me 
to feel. Hopefully, this will become 
easier as the show goes on and they 

spend more time growing these 
characters.

It’s impossible to talk about “This 

is Us” without discussing the huge 
twist at the end of the pilot. If you 
don’t want to know what happens, 
stop reading here, go watch it and 
come back.

The last moments of “This is 

Us” reveal the children Jack and 
Rebecca have are Kate and Kevin, 
and they adopt Randall after he’s 
brought into the hospital by a fire-
man and they lose their third trip-
let in the birth. So, this is a show 
that will be taking place across 
two different decades, with Jack 
and Rebecca in the ’70s and their 
now adult children in the present. 
It’s a compelling bait-and-switch 
that’s only matched in this week’s 
premieres by creator Dan Fogel-
man’s (“Galavant”) other drama, 
“Pitch.” This could easily become 
a gimmick, where the drama relies 
on the twist to force its emotional 
payoffs (especially because it 
doesn’t reveal the fates of the par-
ents in the present). However, if 
used well, it can connect the les-
sons the parents learn in the past 
with what the kids are doing in the 
present. The trick will be to not 
force ties between past and pres-
ent where they don’t belong.

The twist in “This is Us” has 

somewhat overshadowed discus-
sion of the other aspects of the 
pilot. It’s a very good twist, but 
it wouldn’t work without all the 
convincing character work earlier 
in the episode. “Parks and Recre-
ation” and “Parenthood” are two 
of my favorite shows, and compar-
ing them to “This is Us” is setting 
an awfully high bar for the new 
series to cross. However, if this 
drama reaches its full potential, it 
will easily be up there as one of the 
best on network television.

New pilot comes with big emotions, big twists and big talent

All it took was six seconds. 

This small blip of time was 
enough to launch Shawn Mendes 
from his popular 
Vine account to 
releasing two solo 
albums. Working 
with the basics 
of popular songs, 
Mendes 
covered 

others’ 
tracks 

while 
putting 

his own acoustic 
spin on them. The 
newest of his albums, Illuminate, 
steps outside the realm of young, 
male pop stardom and into more 
mature, complex territory.

As would be expected, the 

album deals almost exclusively 
of love, of heartbreak, budding 
physical intimacy and how to 
handle a relationship gone sour. 
Instead of focusing on the gooey 
center of a fresh relationship, 
Mendes often chooses to tackle its 
hardened end. Tracks like “Three 
Empty Words” and “Don’t Be a 
Fool” hint that Mendes is wise 
beyond his years; he confronts 
the imminent end in his relation-
ships rather than unnecessarily 
stringing them out. Echoing art-
ists like John Mayer, the open-
ing song “Ruin” allows Mendes’s 
voice to echo as the guitar rolls 
and drawls on with him.

Though much of the album is 

well developed in sound and lyr-

ics, there are moments when the 
talk of romance and relationships 
becomes too much. Slipping into 
repetitive territory, sections of 
the work are plagued by lulls. 
Never spanning more than three 

tracks, these low 
moments are char-
acterized by recur-
rent 
reassurances 

that Mendes wants 
only what is best for 
his 
soon-to-be-ex 

and that the break-
up isn’t any easier 
on him than it is the 
other party. While 

all is well and good, when used 
in excess these traits become 
stretched and slightly unbeliev-
able. “Like This” and “Don’t Be a 
Fool” are two songs that unfortu-
nately fall victim to this phenom-
enon.

Despite its low points, Illumi-

nate is made up of successes. Play-
ing on his various vocal abilities, 
Mendes pairs his dynamic voice 
with an equally as varied instru-
mental scape. Slower tracks fea-
ture drawn out, ringing guitar 
while others, like “Patience,” use 
strum and slap techniques paired 
with round, atmospheric tones 
to create a lively sound. On these 
lighter tracks, Mendes’s voice 
shifts from that of a more serious 
ballad to a spry, soft delivery.

Following in those nimble 

footsteps, the most notable tracks 
are those that played into some 
element of the pop-tune machine. 

Songs like “Mercy” and “No 
Promises” have choruses fea-
turing energetic backup vocals 
and lyrics that are easy to catch 
on to. Scratching the surface of 
the playboy pop persona, “No 
Promises” depicts a no-strings-
attached relationship.

Even though the album is 

filled with talk of love and pas-
sion, Mendes barely touches the 
topic of sexuality and, as this is an 
album penned by an 18-year-old-
boy, its absence leaves something 
to be desired. That being said, the 
one track that does tackle this 
topic head first, “Lights On,” does 
it very well. Feeding Mendes’s 
“good guy” persona, “Lights 
On” is playful as Mendes sings 
of appreciating his lover’s body. 
One can almost hear the longing 
sighs of dedicated fans as Mendes 
croons, “I can’t deny I want your 
body.” In directly addressing 
physical intimacy, “Lights On” 
branches out from other tracks 
while pointing toward the poten-
tial future of Mendes’s sound.

The mature nature of Illu-

minate is even more impressive 
when considering this is only 
Mendes’s 
sophomore 
album. 

Though young, Mendes’s tal-
ent is undeniable — spewing out 
vocal riffs far more soulful than 
his years and perfectly executing 
Ed Sheeran-esque instrumenta-
tion. Having only recently turned 
18, the possibilities for the young 
Canadian are multiplying by the 
minute.

ALBUM REVIEW

TV REVIEW

ABC has added yet another 

series to its roster of formulaic 
family sitcoms, but this one’s a 
little 
different. 

“Speechless” cen-
ters on the DiMeo 
clan –– a fam-
ily with a special-
needs child named 
J.J. (Micah Fowler, 
“Labor Day”). J.J., 
who has cerebral 
palsy (as does the 
talented 
young 

actor who portrays 
him), 
is 
quickly 

revealed to be an audacious teen 
in his own right, not unlike his 
two siblings Ray (Mason Cook, 
“The Goldbergs”) and Dylan (Kyla 
Kenedy, “The Walking Dead”).

In the series premiere, the three 

teens are forced to change schools 
yet again as their mother, Maya 
DiMeo (Minnie Driver, “About 
a Boy”), relentlessly searches for 
a school that will accommodate 
J.J. Maya fights the commonly 
futile struggle against a system 
that fails to provide the neces-
sary resources to students like J.J. 
The latest pretext in their series 
of moves is a school that provides 
a “voice” for J.J., a cloyingly chip-
per school staff member who is 
constantly at J.J.’s side to help him 
communicate with those around 
him. Though the “voice” is a win 
for Maya, she soon finds another 
cause for protest: the school’s 
handicap ramp is the same ramp 
used to load and unload trash. In 
a hilariously piercing comment, 
Maya asks the school principal 
what kind of disabilities the trash 

being carried out has, pointing out 
the neglectful injustice in her son 
being required to use such a ramp.

Driver executes her role as 

the unfettered advocate for her 
son’s rights with such moxie that 

it’s impossible not 
to find her feroc-
ity 
charming. 

Her 
indignation 

at every obstacle 
faced by her son 
is 
heartwarming, 

yet the show estab-
lishes that her char-
acter is as strong as 
she is endearing. 
The town’s police 
seem to agree –– 

when she speeds past a parked 
cop car no less than two times, a 
seasoned officer stops his partner 
from pursuing her, simply shak-
ing his head and saying, “Not her. 
Life’s too short.”

Though the title would have you 

believe otherwise, “Speechless” is 
actually full of sharp, unfiltered 
dialogue wielded primarily by 
the charming-as-ever Driver. The 
family’s unconventional, outspo-
ken matriarch adds a refreshing 
dose of brazen quirkiness to the 
stale family dynamic seen in most 
of the network’s sitcoms. That 
isn’t to say that everyone is eas-
ily persuaded by Maya’s persistent 
charm. J.J.’s younger brother Ray 
questions whether his parents’ 
decision to move into a shabby 
home along the bustling high-
way is a necessary change or just 
another rash solution to the perva-
sive issue of J.J.’s schooling. 

John Ross Bowie (“The Big 

Bang 
Theory”) 
plays 
Jimmy 

DiMeo, Maya’s equally eccentric, 
yet complacent parenting partner. 

Without being overshadowed by 
Maya, Jimmy complements her 
character with a subtle quirkiness 
and grounding acceptance. He and 
Ray also share a bond that deepens 
the audience’s relationship with 
the DiMeo family through yet 
another lens into what feels like an 
authentic family dynamic. Though 
Ray’s maturity and determina-
tion to be heard in his parents’ 
decision-making process borders 
on absurd at times, as do Maya and 
Jimmy’s antics, these qualities feel 
like exaggerated personifications 
of their real-life counterparts.

While the resonance of the 

series is partly due to creator Scott 
Silveri’s (known for “Friends”) 
own experiences growing up with 
an older brother with cerebral 
palsy, it has all the components of 
a great comedy. Poignant moments 
are countered with warm humor, 
making the plot and its charac-
ters feel familiar. The show pro-
vides insight into what it’s like 
to live with a disability without 
overtly politicizing the subject 
matter. Simply, in a time where 
network television has fallen 
under criticism for failing to accu-
rately portray diversity on screen, 
“Speechless” 
has 
successfully 

found its voice through an identity 
that has rarely, if ever, been repre-
sented in the media in an accurate 
and relatable manner. 

Though “Speechless” has the 

feel of a network TV sitcom, it 
tackles a reality far beyond the 
grasp of most network shows cur-
rently on air with refreshing heart 
and humor. The new show is more 
than a deftly executed series with 
a stellar cast, it’s a win for both 
ABC and for network television 
comedies.

FILM REVIEW

A woman’s struggle to balance 

her career and family is well-trod-
den ground in narrative cinema, 
but “Mia Madre” 
goes beyond the 
surface 
to 
illus-

trate one woman’s 
own 
experiences 

in nuanced — albeit 
dull — detail.

The film cen-

ters on Margherita 
(Margherita 
Buy, 

“A Five Star Life”), a film direc-
tor having difficulties shooting a 
film about labor rights while deal-
ing with her distant relationships 
with loved ones. The driving force 
of the movie is her elderly mother 
Ada (Giulia Lazzarini, “Piazza 
Fontana: The Italian Conspira-
cy”), who is being hospitalized and 
is slowly dying after pneumonia 
enlarged her already weak heart.

Though this sounds quite dra-

matic, the film buzzes around so 
many other people in Margherita’s 
life (her crew, her daughter and ex-
husband, her new boyfriend) that 
it never gives Margherita time to 
truly share her feelings and let the 
viewer feel what’s going on inside 
her head during these difficult 
times. She’s too busy, no thanks to 
her American leading man Barry 

(John Turturro, “Barton Fink”) 
delivering his lines in bad Italian 
and accommodating Margheri-
ta’s firm directing decisions with 
unwanted interjections.

Barry’s first meeting with Mar-

gherita makes it 
clear that he’s an 
asshole. After being 
personally 
picked 

up by her from the 
airport late at night, 
he tries to sleep 
with her and then 
claims he’s joking 
when he’s rebuffed. 

This immediately establishes him 
as an unlikable character from the 
get-go. Though he doesn’t try any-
thing that problematic for the rest 
of the movie, he does pull these 
“jokes” after making diva demands 
on set one too many times to be 
totally likable. Thankfully, Barry 
and the rest of the crew become 
more likable after respecting Mar-
gherita’s directorial choices to a 
fault and listening to her concerns 
about her mother. This not only 
adds depth to secondary charac-
ters, but gives Margherita a cru-
cial sense of authority that avoids 
the stereotypical “bossiness” that 
might have been come across oth-
erwise.

Unfortunately, the same tech-

nique is used to convey how 
Margherita conflicts with her 

family, with less effective results. 
Her family tells her she isn’t 
around enough and make her feel 
bad when they display a stronger 
connection to her mother. But the 
director is never shown choosing 
to film over spending time with 
her loved ones, making the true 
cause of their frosty relationship 
unclear. Plenty of people have a 
full plate at work, and as a result 
spend less time with their family 
than they would like. Is Margher-
ita upset now because she didn’t 
consider the long-term conse-
quences of living like this before? 
For such a dedicated woman, this 
seems unlikely. Since we only 
see what she can see, it’s impos-
sible to understand the effect her 
busy work schedule has on those 
around her. There’s no way to tell 
how valid her family’s complaints 
of her distant relationship with 
them are.

Though the plot gets a little 

murky as it tries to incorporate 
the struggles of the many people 
who populate Margherita’s life, 
the pacing is swift and the actors 
are engaging. The focus of the 
movie could have been narrowed 
to give Margherita enough time to 
give meaning to what’s happening 
in her life. But it still manages to 
portray her existence realistically, 
giving her complexity and life, 
which is no easy feat.

‘Mia Madre’ is a dull but well-made, 
mature film with realistic detail

TV REVIEW
GENDER & MEDIA COLUMN

The first time I heard the 

premise of “Jane the Virgin,” 
I rolled my eyes. A virgin gets 
artificially inseminated with 
some guy’s sperm? That sound-
ed like it would be hard to take 
seriously. Then I hit finals week 
before Christmas vacation and 
needed a new show to help me 
procrastinate. It was on Netf-
lix, and I needed to practice my 
Spanish anyway, so I figured I’d 
give it a try.

It instantly became one of 

my favorite shows. A few weeks 
ago, I finished the second sea-
son.

I love “Jane the Virgin” 

because it never allows people 
to make snap judgments about 
the role feminism plays in it or 
in the lives of its characters. 
It’s one of the most nuanced 
shows regarding intersectional 
feminism, specifically as it 
deals with sex, virginity and 
religion. Today, thanks to femi-
nists and time, women can now 
have sex — even premarital 
sex! — without worrying about 
ruining their entire reputation, 
or you know, their lives. Yes, 
it’s still complicated and there 
are social consequences, and 
it isn’t the same everywhere in 
the world, but it’s inarguably 
better for women now than it 
used to be.

But as more people — spe-

cifically women, as virgin-
ity is a much more weighted 
symbol for women than for 
men — recognize virginity as a 
social construct, we’re seeing 
increasing backlash the other 
way. It often has less to do with 
the semiotics of sex and more 
with the sex-obsessed and 
exploitative media industry. 
Either way, virginity is now 
something people actively try 
to leave behind on their college 
campuses. The possession of it 
is ridiculed in popular media, 
in stories about high school, 
college and even real adults. 
Sometimes sex positivity is 
taken too far and used as a tool 
to shame people — again, espe-
cially women — who aren’t hav-
ing sex, for whatever reason.

When this reason is religion, 

discussions about feminism 
get even more complicated. 
There are some feminists who, 
forcefully rejecting the sexual 

suppression of women, are so 
sex positive that women who 
choose to wait until marriage 
or the “right person” or what-
ever can be subject to their 
condescension, disdain and 
ridicule. 

“Jane the Virgin” pokes 

holes in that brand of femi-
nism (there’s a penis joke in 
there somewhere, I’m sure, 
let me know if you find it). 
I’d be lying if I said it didn’t 
take me a minute to get over 
the virginity thing — not that 
Jane Villanueva is a virgin, but 
that she’s a virgin because her 
abuela told her firmly when she 
was younger to “protect her 
flower” because once she’s lost 
it, she can never get it back. I 
immediately mentally recoiled 
at that part while watching this 
show for the first time. I was 
raised Catholic — Irish Catho-
lic, not Venezuelan Catholic, 
but the ideas about virginity 
are the same. I went to an all-
girls Catholic school and loved 
parts of it, but by the time my 
friends and I hit 10th grade, we 
were starting to wonder about 
things, like why women’s vir-
ginities were being sold by their 
fathers to passersby and things 
like that. (Then we learned 
about the misogyny inherent 
in the Bible and several girls in 
my grade became atheists, but 
I digress.)

So there was a day or two 

where I asked myself if the 
show was as feminist as I first 
thought, if part of the premise 
revolved around an antiquated 
value placed upon virginity. 
It’s a valid question, but any 
single-word answer is bound 
to be incorrect. As this show 
reminds you over and over 
again, agency is more compli-
cated than that. The show offers 
everyone another fresh and dif-
ferent perspective on virginity 
while still being a sex-positive 
and anti-slut-shaming show. By 

complicating the narrative, it 
broadens our scope and forces 
us to remember that feminism 
means respect for all people, 
and all women, both those who 
have sex whenever, wherever, 
and those who decide to wait — 
for any reason.

And the writing of the vir-

ginity plot isn’t the only reason 
“Jane the Virgin” is such a femi-
nist TV staple. While there are 
love triangles — most notably 
the triangle with Michael and 
Rafael, who are both basically 
good guys — the true love sto-
ries in this show center around 
the Villanueva women, Jane and 
her work and Jane and her son. 
And maybe it’s because it’s a 
telenovela, or maybe it’s because 
the writers decided that it’d be 
nice to have a happy ending for 
once, but at the height of con-
flict between Jane’s love life and 
her work life, she gets to have 
both. The show also devotes a 
story to the often faceless issue 
of deportation. I’d bet that this 
show has done more to make 
people empathize than any lib-
eral pundit on the news.

Incidentally, I was reading 

random blog posts about “Jane 
the Virgin” a while ago, and 
read a self-proclaimed conser-
vative feminist’s praise that 
“Jane the Virgin” was pro-life. 
But it isn’t. It’s pro-choice, 
because it isn’t anti-choice. 
When Jane first finds out that 
she’s pregnant and is sent into 
a tailspin, her mother seriously 
asks her if she would consider 
an abortion. Pro-choice doesn’t 
always have to mean abortion; 
it simply means women get to 
choose. I love this show because 
it affords women respect, no 
matter what their sexuality sta-
tus or beliefs. 

Given our current political 

situation, it can be hard to for-
get that it’s never as simple as 
“liberal” or “conservative,” pro-
life or pro-choice, even virgin 
or non-virgin (not that that one 
should matter, but in some ways 
regrettably it still does). People 
aren’t composed of checkboxes, 
and like sexuality, ideologies lie 
on a spectrum. Few shows right 
now encapsulate this as per-
fectly as “Jane the Virgin.”

What does the afterlife look 

like? Is it dark and barren? Do 
we get to see our loved ones 
who have passed 
already? Are any 
religions correct 
in 
determining 

what it’ll be like? 
These 
kinds 
of 

questions 
have 

been asked and 
thrown 
around 

for years in philo-
sophical debates, 
college 
class-

rooms and laid 
back stoner ses-
sions. But in the 
world of NBC’s clever new com-
edy “The Good Place” — created 
by “Parks & Recreation” and 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine” 
mas-

termind Michael Schur — the 
afterlife might simply be a place 
that mirrors our own flawed 
society, except with a few thou-
sand more frozen yogurt shops.

Without 
ruminating 
too 

much on the complicated, reli-
gious-heavy nature of Heaven 
and Hell, “The Good Place” 
pulls no punches in establish-
ing an amiable yet thought-
provoking idea of the world 
to come. Even more so, the 
show offers an intriguing plot 
about grappling with past mis-
takes and working to become 
a “good” human being, even in 
the afterlife.

The hapless female lead Elea-

nor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell, 
“House of Lies”) attempts to 
be this better person after her 
tragicomic death sends her to 
the Good Place, a paradisal, 
corporatized hereafter filled 
with millions of deceased do-
gooders. Enter Michael (Ted 
Danson, “Bored to Death”), the 
befuddled, 
bow-tie 
wearing 

architect of the Good Place, who 
explains to Eleanor that she’s in 
the Good Place due to her good 
deeds of getting innocent people 

off death row and helping starv-
ing children in Ukraine. Prob-
lem is, Eleanor didn’t do any 
of that — there’s been a mixup, 
and she’s been put in the Good 
Place by mistake. Now, Eleanor 

must avoid being 
found 
out 
and 

subsequently sent 
to eternal damna-
tion, known as the 
Bad Place. 

For 
a 
tradi-

tional sitcom with 
a 
high-concept, 

supernatural 
twist, “The Good 
Place” 
is 
fasci-

nating and even 
quite 
cerebral, 

thanks to Shur’s 

assured direction, writing and 
talented collaborators — “The 
Martian” screenwriter Drew 
Goddard directed the pilot. 
The witty dialogue alone makes 
“The Good Place” stand out as a 
comedy aiming to take risks and 
often hitting the targets. At one 
point in the pilot, Eleanor asks, 
“Who’s in the Bad Place that 
would shock me?”

“Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basi-

cally every artist ever. Every 
U.S. president, except for Lin-
coln,” Michael deadpans.

“That sounds about right,” 

Eleanor responds.

The main plot, though some-

what formulaic, also proves 
to be an effective and intelli-
gent story, tracking Eleanor’s 
journey from being a horrible, 
insufferable person on Earth, 
showcased 
through 
darker 

toned flashbacks, to someone 
with a slightly improving moral 
compass in a utopic eternity. 
Along the way, Eleanor gets 
reluctant help from ingenious 
ethics professor and chosen 
soulmate Chidi Anagonye (Wil-
liam Jackson Harper, “True 
Story”), who has promised to 
keep her secret from Michael 
and the rest of the Good Place 
townsfolk. Bell and Harper’s 
banter and chemistry is also 

surprisingly 
pleasant 
and 

refreshing, 
propelling 
“The 

Good Place” into something 
that’s more than just an ordi-
nary comedy about the afterlife. 

In the midst of the show’s 

brilliant writing and storytell-
ing, the acting is what truly 
certifies the brilliance of “The 
Good Place,” which makes sense 
considering how Schur has 
incorporated similarly talented, 
diverse casts in his other shows. 
Following her comedic lead-
ing part on Showtime’s now-
defunct “House of Lies,” Bell 
returns to the small screen to 
deliver yet another nuanced and 
charming lead performance. 
Danson also makes a welcome 
comeback to network televi-
sion, still hilarious and sharp at 
68 years old. Additionally, Jack-
son Harper performs admirably 
in what might be his breakout 
role, along with Michael’s Siri-
like assistant Janet (D’Arcy 
Carden, “Broad City”), Elea-
nor’s beautiful, uppity neigh-
bor Tahani al-Jamil (newcomer 
Jameela Jamil) and her mute 
monk soulmate Jianyu (Manny 
Jacinto, “Once Upon a Time”). 

While “The Good Place” 

certainly delivers, a part of me 
fears for its fate. It reminds me 
of another somewhat similar, 
high-concept sitcom that I used 
to watch: ABC’s promising, 
short-lived “Samantha Who?” 
That show, which lasted only 
two seasons, followed a blonde-
haired female lead (Christina 
Applegate), who wakes up with 
amnesia and seeks to make a 
fresh start to separate from 
her past mean self. Fortu-
nately, “The Good Place” pos-
sesses a much stronger position 
in this newly emerged era of 
“peak TV.” But considering the 
crowded network schedule and 
the tendency for networks to 
cancel shows with middling rat-
ings despite high acclaim, let’s 
hope the NBC heads keep “The 
Good Place” from going six feet 
under.

Braden, O-line coming off strong performance

Like his fellow offensive 

linemen, Ben Braden heard the 
criticism. And like the rest of 
the unit, he had heard it before. 
But when the Michigan football 
team rushed for just 119 yards 
against Central Florida, Braden 
— the Wolverines’ fifth-year 
senior left guard — had to take it 
from unlikely sources.

“Even my family and friends 

will be like, ‘What was going 
on with that?’ or ‘We expected 
more from you guys,’ and yeah, 
we always expect to have more 
rushing yards,” Braden said. 
“Sometimes it just depends on 
the game and what scheme the 
defense has.”

Saturday, two weeks after 

that 
lackluster 
performance, 

the Wolverines erased doubt. 
They rushed for 326 yards, 
their highest total since the 
2014 season opener against 
Appalachian State and their 
most in a Big Ten game since 
Oct. 13, 2012, against Illinois.

The 
breakout 
game 
was 

rewarding especially for Braden, 
who missed the Sept. 3 season 
opener against Hawaii to avoid 
aggravating a lower-back strain. 
After he fully recovered, he 
jumped back into action the next 
week against Central Florida, 
splitting time with freshman 
Ben Bredeson and then playing 
the entire game Saturday against 
the Nittany Lions.

Braden said he hasn’t suffered 

any setbacks since the injury 
and now feels better than he did 
even at the end of last season. 
According to Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh, he played 80 
snaps, the most on the team — a 
title usually reserved for redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers.

But this week, Michigan’s 

offense ran 84 plays compared 
to Penn State’s 55, putting the 
offense on the field for most 

of the game. The Wolverines’ 
running 
game 
controlled 

the clock, and while some of 
the other proficient rushing 
performances 
have 
been 

boosted by big plays, the 326 
on Saturday was a result of a 
bruising attack.

Michigan gained 40, 39, 37, 

30 and 25 yards on five runs, but 
no more than 11 on any other. 
Even without those carries, the 
Wolverines still would have 
averaged a modest 3.5 yards per 
carry.

The pounding took a toll on 

Penn State, too. At one point in 
the second half, Michigan called 
seven consecutive runs — five 
dive plays and two toss plays 
— and rolled over the Nittany 
Lions to the tune of 43 yards and 
a touchdown.

“I loved it,” Braden said. “It 

was a lot of fun. I haven’t had 
that much fun in a while … that 
is always awesome. It’s always 
a sense of satisfaction as an 
offensive lineman when you 
run that many yards and you 
have that many points and score 
many touchdowns. You see your 
running backs hitting huge run 
plays, and you just feel like, ‘All 
right, we did our job because 
he’s 10, 15 yards down the field, 
or more.’ ”

More often, the opposing 

offensive players are the ones 
standing with 
their 
hands 

on 
their 

hips 
in 
the 

second halves 
of 
games, 

buckling 
under 
the 

physicality of 
Michigan’s 
defense. 
Saturday, Penn State’s defense 
showed similar wear toward the 
end of those drives in the second 
half. The Wolverines strung 
together six possessions of at 
least nine plays apiece.

Michigan’s rushing attack 

also 
showed 
less 
diversity 

and more of a rhythm than in 
previous weeks. The Wolverines 
can use several weapons in 
their ground game, including 

four running 
backs, 
two 

fullbacks and 
speedy 
wide 

receivers 
Jehu Chesson 
and 
Eddie 

McDoom.

But 
on 

Saturday, 
42 

of Michigan’s 

49 carries went to the backfield, 
and many of those went up 
the middle. Two sweeps to 
McDoom, two scrambles by 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight and three kneel-

downs were the only exceptions. 
The four running backs each 
ran for at least 6.7 yards per 
carry, a good sign for a rushing 
attack that was still looking to 
establish continuity between 
four players.

“I like so many things,” 

Harbaugh said. “De’Veon, boy 
does he run hard, gosh. He had 
one of his runs early in the game 
where he broke in there, six or 
seven yards, and then bounced 
off a tackle, did the spin, kept 
going. Somebody’s trying to hit 
him, and he’s still going.

“But to watch our offensive 

line pursue, that’s what really 
got me excited. Our offensive 
line 
knows 
it, 
too, 
when 

De’Veon’s running the football. 
Their pursuit was almost as 
good as our defense’s pursuit. 

And 
that’s 
gotten 
better, 

because they know that they got 
a chance to get downfield and 
make a block.”

The 
offensive 
line 
now 

heads into a stern test Saturday 
against 
Wisconsin, 
which 

deploys a defensive front much 
like Michigan’s. The Badgers 
rank 10th in the country in 
rush defense, allowing just 80.5 
yards per game, 42 fewer than 
the Wolverines.

Making holes against that 

unit will not be as easy as it 
was against Penn State, but 
with a fully healthy Braden, 
the Wolverines are as prepared 
as they can be. When told he 
played 80 snaps on Saturday, 
Braden said, “I didn’t know I 
played that many. It went by 
quick.”

Fifth-year senior offensive guard Ben Braden is settling back in after missing the season-opener with a back strain.

“I haven’t had 
that much fun 

in a while.”

Clark’s season-ending injury hits ‘M’ hard

It was one of the lowest 

moments of his career on the 
Michigan football team, but 
Jeremy Clark was far from 
alone.

When the fifth-year senior 

cornerback tore his anterior 
cruciate ligament while part of 
a kickoff return in the fourth 
quarter Saturday against Penn 
State, most of the Wolverines’ 
sideline walked out to midfield 
and gathered around Clark as 
he was helped onto the cart that 
took him to the locker room.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen 

that before,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “It was 
that way in the locker room 
as well. We came together as 
a team after the game in the 
locker room, and half the team 
went into the training room 
to see Jeremy. He’s a highly 
respected person on our team.”

Even 
with 
All-American 

senior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis finally returning to action 
last week, Clark is no small loss 
for the Wolverines. Before this 
weekend, Pro Football Focus 
College Football had rated him 
as the second-best cornerback 
in the Big Ten, behind only his 
teammate, senior cornerback 

Channing Stribling.

Monday, 
when 
Harbaugh 

officially 
confirmed 
the 

season-ending injury, most of 
Michigan’s players still had 
Clark on their minds. Redshirt 
junior fullback Khalid Hill was 
part of the group to come out 
and comfort Clark at midfield. 
Having torn his own ACL in 
2014, Hill was one of the few 
players 
who 
could 
actually 

understand what his teammate 
was feeling.

“To be in a game, in your fifth 

year, that’s not how you want 
to go out,” Hill said. “I wanted 
to shed a tear with him (when) 
he was on the field. I went to 

him, grabbed him, told him, 
‘Everything’s gonna be OK.’ If 
he needed me, I’d be there for 
him.”

Clark played safety before 

Harbaugh entered the fold at 
the end of 2014, and according 
to fifth-year senior offensive 
lineman Ben Braden, seeing the 
work he put in to earn a job as 
starting corner made it all the 
more difficult to see him go 
down.

As Harbaugh mentioned, the 

support for Clark continued in 
the locker room, where redshirt 
sophomore defensive end Chase 
Winovich was just one of many 
players to share a moment 

with him. Winovich wouldn’t 
disclose what exactly was said, 
but Monday, he reflected on just 
how cruel football can be.

“I remember in camp, one of 

our managers actually dislocated 
his shoulder,” Winovich said. 
“He was in a sling, and he wasn’t 
even on the football field. It’s 
crazy to think that nobody’s safe. 
… It’s a shame that it happened 
to Jeremy the way it did. I’m 
sure he’s gonna come back from 
it stronger than ever, like a 
slingshot, but it’s heartbreaking 
to see that happen to one of my 
teammates.”

Harbaugh 
said 
Michigan 

will try to pursue a medical 
redshirt to get Clark a sixth 
year of eligiblity. The NCAA 
typically will grant a medical 
hardship waiver to players who 
are injured in the first half of 
the season and have played 
under 30 percent of the year, 
but there is no guarantee. In 
the meantime, the Wolverines 
will have to scramble quickly to 
replace Clark for this season.

Lewis 
and 
Stribling 
are 

extremely capable of holding 
down the secondary as starting 
corners, but the picture behind 
them is less clear. Redshirt 
sophomore cornerback Brandon 
Watson will have to be a factor, 
especially 
after 
seeing 
an 

increase in playing time this 
season due to Lewis’ injury. And 
Harbaugh anticipates that a pair 
of freshman corners will need to 
be thrown into the fire as well.

“Both 
David 
Long 
(and) 

Lavert Hill are gonna step to 
the fore now,” Harbaugh said. 
“They’ve been practicing and 
playing a little bit, and now 
they’ll be called on.”

Michigan shows championship 
potential in win over Spartans

As the whistle blew for 

halftime, the Michigan women’s 
soccer team, which won its 
first two Big Ten games last 
weekend, walked to its bench 
with the score still stuck at zero. 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan was 
visibly upset. His team looked 
nothing like the one that had 
won its last four games.

“I really got into them at 

halftime,” Ryan said. “I told 
them they’re better than that. 
And 
they 
responded 
really 

well.”

The Wolverines (3-0-0 Big 

Ten, 7-1-1 overall) came out for 
the second half looking like 
the same team they have been 
most of the season. By the final 
whistle, the scoreboard read 1-0 
in favor of Michigan.

The 
Wolverines 
showed 

Michigan State why they are 
being touted as potential Big 
Ten champions by earning their 
third win, keeping their perfect 
conference record intact and 
increasing their overall win 
streak to five. And truth be 
told, the score-line flattered the 
Spartans.

At first it was a day where 

the ball just didn’t want to go 
in for Michigan, but by the end, 
the Wolverines proved their 
quality. 

They ended the day with 

20 shots, forcing Michigan 
State 
goalkeeper 
Savanna 

Wojtanowski into seven saves. 
Michigan also had two further 
efforts cleared off the line, and 
one pushed onto the post by the 
Spartans’ stubborn defense.

With a few minutes left on the 

clock, redshirt junior forward 
Ani Sarkisian rose highest in 
the box to head home a cross 
from 
sophomore 
midfielder 

Reilly Martin. For all her good 
work that night, Wojtanowski 
stood helpless as she saw the 
ball hit the back 
of her net.

“I think Reilly 

and I are a good 
duo,” Sarkisian 
said. “We both 
like to get the 
ball, turn and 
go after them. 
That’s a team’s 
worst nightmare 
when 
players 

take 
them 
on 

one on one and 
I think we did that really well.”

The 
Wolverines 
boast 

an 
intimidating 
front 
line. 

Sarkisian sits on five goals 
this season, while Martin and 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Abby 

Kastroll have scored four each. 
It seems goals are flying in 
from everywhere as Michigan 
is scoring at a rate of 2.11 
goals per game, second only to 
Minnesota’s 2.36 in the Big Ten.

“Their goalie made some 

great saves,” Ryan said. “On 
another day like this, we might 
have scored three or four. We 
just gotta keep doing what we’re 
doing.”

At the defensive end of the 

field, only Northwestern has 
more clean sheets per game 
than 
Michigan’s 
sophomore 

goalkeeper Sarah Jackson. She 
has conceded in just two out of 
the seven games she has played 
this season.

The 
statistical 
dominance 

is reflected in the Big Ten 

standings where the Wolverines 
are the only team with three 
wins and a perfect record. 

“This team is capable of 

beating every team on our 
schedule,” Ryan said. “So if 
we just roll up our sleeves, we 

can 
contend 

for the Big Ten 
championship.”

Michigan will 

host Rutgers on 
Thursday night 
in 
a 
top-of-

the-table 
clash 

that could be a 
potential tipping 
point in the race 
for the Big Ten 
title.

The 
Scarlet 

Knights have had a season 
almost identical to Michigan. 
They would have matched the 
Wolverines’ record, but were 
held to a stalemate against 
Illinois the day after Michigan 
beat Michigan State.

However, a win for Rutgers 

would see them jump ahead of 
the Wolverines, while a win for 
Michigan would make the team 
an outright favorite for the Big 
Ten championship.

“The 
way 
we’ve 
always 

worked is that we’re totally 
focused on the next game,” 
Ryan said. “We want to contend 
for the championship, and to do 
that, we’re probably gonna have 
to win the next game.”

With 
Michigan’s 
current 

form, playing the Wolverines 
is a daunting prospect for 
anyone. Although still early in 
the season, the Wolverines have 
effectively thrown down the 
gauntlet for every team in the 
Big Ten this season.

Wolverines finish third at Windon

Two tournaments into the 2016 

fall season, the Michigan men’s 
golf team has begun what could be 
a trend: a good Day 1 followed by 
an even better Day 2.

The 
Wolverines 
teed 
off 

Sunday in Glenview, Ill., at the 
Windon Memorial Classic, an 
annual tournament hosted by 
Northwestern. The tournament 
consisted of two rounds Sunday 
and a final round Monday.

Despite having played only one 

tournament prior, Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten felt good about the 
lineup he chose.

“We had about 10 days, or about 

two weeks after the first day of 
school, to play a lot of qualifying 
rounds 
around 
Ann 
Arbor,” 

Whitten said. “Between that and 
looking at their past experiences, 
that helps us to shape the lineup a 
little bit.”

Though Michigan ended up 

shooting an 870 for an impressive 
third at the tournament, the event 
did not begin as well as it hoped 
for.

In 
the 
first 
round, 
the 

Wolverines were led by senior 
Reed Hrynewich, who shot a 68 
to lead all competitors in the field. 
Following Hrynewich were junior 
Kyle Mueller and sophomore 
Nick Carlson, who shot 71 and 74, 
respectively. Overall, the team shot 
a 288 for the first round, which had 
Michigan tied for fourth.

Later that day, the Wolverines 

had to go back on the course for 
the second round. Michigan was 
holding its position through the 
second round before a lightning 
delay postponed the final two 
holes of the round until Monday. 
At the end of Day 1 — with the 
second round not yet finished — 
the Wolverines were sitting fifth.

After finishing the final two 

holes Monday morning, Michigan 
was still sitting fifth, and Mueller, 
Hrynewich and Carlson again led 
the team.

Though the rain and lightning 

had passed, a strong wind swept 

through the Windy City metro 
area, which caused most teams to 
falter. For the Wolverines, though, 
the wind was just the boost that 
they needed.

With the winds behind the 

team, Michigan shot a day-
three score of 288, the lowest 
third-round score of any of the 
fourteen teams competing. The 
next lowest third-round score 
was a 293, shot by tournament 
champion Florida.

Leading the charge for the 

Wolverines during the third round 
was Mueller, who shot a 67 to earn 
the individual tournament crown 
with an overall score of 209.

“Kyle just had a great round 

today,” Whitten said. “The course 
played more difficult today; there 
was really a lot of wind, and the 
greens were faster, and the hole 
locations were really tough. So for 
Kyle to shoot five-under today was 
a great round.”

Carlson 
followed 
Mueller 

with a round-three 70, and the 
Wolverines’ total score of 870 
put them in third place for the 

tournament, behind Florida and 
Eastern Michigan.

“In the first two tournaments 

of the year we’ve started kind of 
slow but then had very good final 
rounds,” Whitten said. “So we 
need to play a little bit better in 
rounds one and two.”

With such an experienced 

lineup 
returning 
this 
year, 

though, Michigan should be in a 
good position to meet Whitten’s 
request. Mueller was one of a 
small handful of college golfers 
to compete in the U.S. Open in 
June, while Carlson made an 
unexpected run all the way to the 
semifinals of the U.S. Amateur. 
There, Carlson lost to eventual 
champion Curtis Luck in a 
sudden-death, 21st-hole playoff.

“We really have good players 

on this team, and the guys know 
it, and they know they are capable 
of playing well,” Whitten said. “I 
think our final round in the first 
two events showed we are capable 
of competing, so we just have to go 
play and be confident and do our 
best every single time.”
