This is the second installment of 
a three-part series investigating 
student mental health at the 
University of Michigan. The Daily 
interviewed students on campus, 
students across the country and 
prominent leaders of mental 
health to contribute to this series. 
In part one, The Daily examined 
student 
complaints 
about 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 
Services 
(CAPS). 
This 
part 
looks at student-led alternatives 
to 
CAPS 
on 
campus. 
Part 
three will discuss how mental 
health systems work at other 
universities, such as Michigan 
State University. 
The University of Michigan 
offers resources to complement 
services 
offered 
by 
the 
University’s 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological Services — such 
as 
peer-to-peer 
counseling, 

Nearly one year after University 
President Mark Schlissel announced 
the addition of a Student Advisory 
Panel to help advise the President’s 
Commission on Carbon Neutrality 
(PCCN), a group working to reduce 
carbon emissions on campus, some 
members of the student panel claim 
the Commission has sidelined their 
role. The Commission’s creation 
followed 
months 
of 
student 

activism and protests that urged 
the University to reduce its carbon 
footprint. 
In Schlissel’s video announcing 
the creation of the PCCN on Feb. 
4, 2019, he directed part of his 
remarks to students, telling them the 
Commission would value their input 
throughout the process. 
“All 
stakeholders 
will 
have 
opportunities to contribute their 
perspectives 
along 
the 
way,” 
Schlissel said in the video. “... I 
especially want our students to know 

that their insights and contributions 
will be key to the successful future 
we are seeking to achieve.”
Schlissel charged the PCCN 
with creating four advisory panels, 
including the SAP, to provide 
various stakeholder perspectives on 
the Commission’s focus and work. 
In the past year, most of the panel’s 
work has consisted of reviewing the 
Commission’s reports and providing 
comments addressing additional 
issues that the members believed 
merited inclusion. 

According 
to 
SAP 
member 
Grant Faber, a Rackham student 
at the School for Environment and 
Sustainability, there was initially 
the possibility that the student 
panel might do research for the 
Commission as well. He said 
the PCCN’s co-chairs, Jennifer 
Haverkamp, director of the Graham 
Sustainability Institute, and Stephen 
Forrest, 
professor 
of 
electrical 
engineering and computer science, 
had indicated this possibility.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
about 75 Ann Arbor residents 
gathered in the SPARK office 
for the Center of the City Task 
Force open house. Residents 
discussed plans for a new park 
and civic center commons on 
the library lot between Fifth 
Avenue and Division Street, 
as well as improvements to 
Liberty Plaza, a public park 
located on East Liberty. 
The Task Force, a 10-person 
municipal 
committee, 
was 
established 
following 
the 
November 2018 passage of 

Proposal A, which designated 
the plot adjacent to the city’s 
downtown public library for 
recreational use. Wednesday’s 
event, in combination with 
an earlier open house and 
online survey, will serve as 
the basis for the Task Force’s 
recommendation 
to 
City 
Council in February.
Task Force Chair Meghan 
Musolff, Ann Arbor resident 
and University of Michigan 
librarian, 
said 
the 
event 
was meant to “report back” 
prior comments and provide 
an 
opportunity 
for 
other 
residents 
to 
voice 
their 
opinions 
about 
the 
park 

and 
commons. 
Musolff 
said the Task Force aims to 
incorporate all opinions from 
the community without bias.
Residents discussed three 
issues: the oversight of the 
library 
lot, 
the 
existence 
and extent of a plot of land 
adjacent to the library and 
the renovation of Liberty 
Plaza. These three issues 
were controversial, Musolff 
said. The event included three 
tables where attendees could 
discuss these issues in small 
groups, monitored by a Task 
Force member.
“We are here to steward 
this process, but it’s really 

important to me that we 
gather the feedback, we hear 
from 
the 
community 
and 
synthesize 
that 
and 
refer 
back to it as we develop 
recommendations and submit 
them,” Musolff said. “Then 
it is up to City Council to 
execute.”
Musolff 
said 
the 
Task 
Force has so far identified 
community 
interest 
in 
developing both affordable 
housing and a green, open 
area that could accommodate 
different events like protests 
and community gatherings.

The University of Michigan 
plans to increase the cost of 
parking violations on campus 
property starting Feb. 1, 2020.
The fine for parking at an 
expired 
meter 
will 
increase 
to $40, or $30 if paid the next 
business day. The fine for parking 
with no permit in a University lot 
will be $75, or $65 if paid the next 
day.
The city of Ann Arbor has its 
own traffic laws separate from the 
University, with meters charging 
$1.90 per hour of parking. The 
price of a parking ticket in the city 
is $25, or $15 if paid the next day. 
The University fees are more 
expensive than city fees for the 
same violations. The Ann Arbor 
fine for violations such as parking 
over the legal limit at a meter, 
parking when no stopping or 
standing signs are posted and 
parking in no-parking zones are 
all $35, or $25 if paid the next 
day. The biggest difference is the 
fee for parking in a fire lane. The 
Ann Arbor violation is $50, or 
$40 if paid the next day, and the 
University violation is $100, or 
$90 the next day.

Council 
considers 
limits on 
Airbnbs

After the Ann Arbor City 
Council 
voted 
to 
consider 
banning dedicated rental houses, 
Airbnb owners and students who 
rely on the service expressed 
disappointment at what they 
considered 
an 
unjust 
and 
misinformed decision on the part 
of the council. 
On Monday, Jan. 6, City 
Council held a vote considering 
the ban of non-owner occupied 
short-term rentals in the city 
— including dedicated Airbnb 
homes. The vote was 9-2, with the 
majority of council members in 
support of the ban. City Council 
has called for city staff to draft 
potential regulations for short-
term rentals by the end of July. 
City Council previously held 
three public forums considering 
regulations for short-term rentals 
in October. These regulations 
considered banning short-term 
rentals in certain zones, taxing the 
properties, requiring registration 
and inspection, establishing a 
minimum and maximum length 
of stay for guests and only 
allowing properties where the 
owner remains at home during 
the stay.

Wolverine 
Support 
Network 
(WSN) — but many students told 
The Daily they were unaware of 
these resources. 
In response, students rely 
on a number of efforts to fill in 
the gaps of CAPS. While these 
resources are distinct from the 
professional counseling services, 
many of them have affiliations 
with CAPS. 
Student Efforts
Some students have stepped 
up to promote positive mental 
health when they can’t find what 
they need in University services. 
Wolverine 
Support 
Network, 
founded by students in 2014 in the 
wake of two suicides on campus, 
provides a peer-led alternative to 
traditional counseling. 
More than 30 groups of six 
to 10 students meet weekly for 
open-ended discussions on their 
well-being, facilitated by trained 
student leaders.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Freda 
Herseth said she does not support 
the use of the library plot for 
affordable housing. She said it was 
not what she agreed to when she cast 
her vote in support of Proposition A. 
She said it was this disagreement 
that compelled her to attend the 
open house.
“I’ve heard that some of the Task 
Force may be wanting to change this 
to include things that we did not vote 
for,” Herseth said. “I’m here to try to 
keep democracy going.”
According to Herseth and other 
attendees, the desire to place 
housing and other private businesses 
in a building on the library plot is 
motivated by money. Ann Arbor 
resident Braxton Blake said he fears 
City Council may be acting on their 
own behalf, rather than on behalf of 
their constituents.
“(The library plot has) become 
a vehicle to sell the quality of our 
city for the profit of those who have 
money already,” Blake said.
When asked what she wanted 
visitors to say about the City when 
they leave, Ann Arbor resident Libby 
Hunter said she wanted people 
to note the area’s walkability and 
uniqueness.

“I would like them to say, 
‘What a great downtown. Let’s 
come back, and let’s tell people 
about it,” Hunter said.
According to Hunter, Blake and 
Herseth, the open plan for the 
library plot can only exist if the 
plans for housing and commercial 
real estate are scrapped.
However, not all attendees 
felt disdain for the library lot 
being developed into affordable 

housing. Ann Arbor resident 
Zachary Storey spoke to the group 
about a period of time in which 
he 
experienced 
homelessness 
and would have benefited greatly 
from 
affordable 
housing 
or 
convertible furniture, which can 
be used as beds after dark.
Despite 
calls 
for 
more 
affordable 
housing 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
some 
attendees 
said 
there are other sites in the city 
that have been designated for 
development. They said residents 
should pressure City Council to 
proceed with those plans without 

undermining their open, green 
vision for the library plot.
Ann Arbor resident Saharsh 
Hajela is a University alum 
who went to work in Ann 
Arbor 
immediately 
following 
graduation. Hajela said he came 
to the event to become more 
involved in his community, but 
feared older residents would 
“villainize” certain types of 
people occupying the park.

“(The co-chairs) hinted at other 
ways to get involved,” Faber said. 
“They said that there might even be 
some research opportunities, things 
that they would want the Student 
Advisory Panel to look into to figure 
out … maybe the Commission would 
run into some kind of problem 
and they would task the Student 
Advisory Panel with doing some sort 
of basic research.”
The PCCN ultimately delegated 
this additional research work to 
eight 
Internal 
Analysis 
Teams 
(IAT): specialized units composed 
of both students and faculty that 
investigated means of cutting carbon 
emissions. The PCCN’s Fall Interim 
Report, which was published on 
Dec. 2, describes this change in the 
SAP’s intended role.
“It was originally conceived 
that (student advisers) would also 
provide research contributions on 
specific topic areas – a role that is 
now being fulfilled through student 
participation on the internal analysis 
teams,” the report reads.
Three SAP members allege that 
the PCCN gave them a short period 
of time to provide their comments 
and that the PCCN ignored most 
of their suggestions. They said the 
PCCN did make changes to official 
reports in response to some of their 
comments, but claimed that these 
revisions were restricted to changes 
in phrasing. According to the 
members, the PCCN never provided 
feedback for why suggestions were 
excluded and they did not learn 
which were included until they saw 
the final published versions.
A member of the panel who 
requested anonymity due to fear 
of losing their position on the 
panel sent an email to The Daily 
detailing concerns with the PCCN. 
The member will be referred to as 
Member 1 in this article.
“Commission 
members 
have 
never once responded to SAP 
suggestions to ask for clarification 
or to explain their reasoning for 
rejecting serious concerns that 
the SAP has brought to them, as 
representatives of the student body,” 
Member 1 wrote. 
Another member of the SAP, 
referred to in this story as Member 
2, 
confirmed 
this 
claim 
and 
expressed disappointment with the 
Commission’s lack of a response to 
their feedback.
“It was frustrating,” Member 2 
said. “We felt it was necessary to 
continue to engage in good faith in 
this process, but we’re still frustrated 
with the outcome and the responses 
that we got from that.”
Faber 
described 
the 
SAP’s 
confusion after seeing little of 
their feedback implemented in the 
reports.
“(We asked ourselves), ‘Are we 
on the right track? Is there a reason 
these things haven’t been addressed? 
Were these things discussed?’ We’ve 
just kind of been totally in the dark,” 
Faber said.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Haverkamp and Forrest explained 
how the PCCN evaluated feedback 
to incorporate into the final versions 
of documents. 
“I’d 
say 
our 
process 
with 
comments from students was the 
same as our process with input from 
members of the Commission, which 
is that we got feedback from multiple 
sources and weighed and balanced 
what we got and as a group put 
together the document that made 
the most sense,” Haverkamp said. 
“We valued the input that we got and 
look very much forward to serious 
engagement by them when we have 
recommendations in the spring.”
According to three SAP members, 
the PCCN held two meetings with 
the entire panel in the Winter 
semester of 2019. The PCCN also 
asked the two student members of 
the Commission to attend the panel’s 
meetings and relay communication 
back to the Commission. The SAP 
members said they haven’t met with 
the co-chairs of the Commission 
since their second meeting on April 
10, 2019. 

Haverkamp and Forrest have 
confirmed they met with the SAP 
twice during the Winter 2019 
semester and have not met with the 
SAP since April 10. However, they 
said they have not met with any 
of the other three advisory panels 
either.
Since the last meeting, the student 
panel has attempted to schedule a 
meeting with the co-chairs at least 
four times, beginning in the middle 
of the Fall 2019 semester, according 
to Member 1 and Faber. 
Member 1 and Faber used their 
suggestions on the Internal Analysis 
Teams reports to explain how their 
advice was neglected. They claimed 
that of the 15 suggestions the SAP 
made, only three were reflected in 
the published version. 
Faber told The Daily he thought 
the official reports should have 
discussed 
the 
early 
focus 
on 
quick solutions that would reduce 
emissions, the dates the co-chairs 
met with the SAP, summaries of 
issues raised at community meetings 
and 
an 
explanation 
for 
why 
divestment does not fall under the 
scope of the PCCN’s work. Instead, 
the three sets of reports focused 
primarily on logistical matters, 
including the purpose and structure 
of the Commission and a timeframe 
for how it would complete each 
phase of its work.
In the Fall Interim Report, SAP 
members also sought to include 
an explanation addressing energy 
procurement 
and 
why 
Camilo 
Serna, vice president of regulatory 
affairs at DTE Energy, had a seat 
on the Commission. Activists raised 
concerns about the inclusion of a 
representative from DTE, a major 
energy utility serving southeast 
Michigan, when the Commission 
was announced last February. The 
University also has an agreement 
with DTE to purchase renewable 
energy from the utility. 
Member 1 argued the Commission 
should have taken up the matter in 
the Fall Interim Report.
“There’s serious concern about 
the fact that the vice president of 
corporate strategy of DTE is on 
the Commission itself,” Member 
1 said. “If we publish this report … 
and nowhere is it mentioned how 
we’re procuring our energy and 
who we’re buying it from and how 
that could potentially be the biggest 
way that U of M impacts the state of 
Michigan and emissions beyond its 
own campuses … it’s basically going 
to be seen as validating the concerns 
that have been raised for more than 
a year.”
The Daily obtained a series 
of memos written by the SAP 
including 
recommendations 
for 
the 
Commission. 
The 
memos, 
dated Oct. 24, 2019, request that 
the Commission address structural 
and planning issues in advance of 
preparing its final recommendations, 
including a justification for every 
SAP suggestion the PCCN did not 
include in its documents. 
In an email to The Daily, Faber, 
one of the five students who signed 
the memos, said the other members 
have been discouraged by the 
PCCN’s general lack of a response 
and that attendance at SAP meetings 
has begun to decline as a result.
“Attendance was pretty high in 
the last couple months of the 2018-
2019 school year but really dropped 
off once we got back for the 2019-
2020 year,” Faber wrote. “We used 
to have ~12 at meetings and now 
it is down to maybe five or so per 
meeting. We were told there would 
be meetings over the summer on 
something like Skype, but this did 
not happen once.”
Faber credited this dropping 
attendance to a feeling that their 
work did not matter.
“There are intelligent and highly 
accomplished students on the SAP,” 
Faber wrote. “My theory is that they 
stopped coming because they began 
to see it as a waste of their time 
rather than out of laziness or a lack 
of caring.”
Some SAP members said the 
PCCN never formally discussed 
the structure of the panel, leaving 
students confused about how often 
the panel would meet and what the 

objectives of the meetings would be.
The two student members of 
the Commission — Engineering 
doctoral student Austin Glass and 
Engineering junior Logan Vear, 
Climate Action Movement president 
— serve as liaisons to the SAP, 
attending both group’s meetings and 
relaying communications between 
the panel and the Commission. Both 
Glass and Vear declined to comment 
for this article due to confidentiality 
agreements they signed with the 
Commission. 
Member 2, who also signed the 
memos, said they wrote the memos 
in an attempt to clearly communicate 
their concerns to the Commission.
“We wanted to make sure that all 
of the concerns that we considered 
serious were contained in one place 
to provide an easy response course 
for the Commission,” Member 
2 said. “They were extended in 
good faith that the Commission 
was considering student concerns, 
and the lack of response seems to 
indicate the opposite of that.”
Three SAP members told The 
Daily they have received no formal 
response to the memos they sent 
to the Commission, though the 
Commission has recently agreed 
to schedule a meeting with the 
panel after weeks of back-and-forth 
communication.
At the time of the interview, 
Member 1 expressed frustration at 
the lack of a response to the memos 
and the inability to find a time to 
meet.
“The fact that they have not 
agreed, not even responded to that 
request, let alone implemented it, 
has been really, really discouraging 
as somebody who has spent a lot 
of time trying to work within this 
process and represent and work 
in good faith,” Member 1 said. “It’s 
really hard to still believe that we 
are not actually just being used as a 
marketing ploy.” 
The co-chairs, Haverkamp and 
Forrest, said shortly after they 
received the SAP’s memos, they 
began the process of scheduling a 
meeting with the SAP to occur in 
the near future, where they plan 
to discuss how they assessed each 
recommendation that they received. 
“We absolutely read everything, 
took it all into consideration,” 
Forrest said. “We are looking 
forward also to our meeting with 
them… that’s the time when we want 
to go methodically through with 
them what was considered with 
each and every recommendation 
so that we can fill the gaps and 
understanding about what they 
think or what they feel became of 
certain recommendations.”
Haverkamp and Forrest said 
the advisory panels will become 
more involved in the future as the 
PCCN prepares to deliver its final 
recommendations to Schlissel.
Member 2 said they were hopeful 
that the upcoming meeting with the 
co-chairs would be productive. 
“Meeting face to face with people 
is an important way to help ideas be 
understood between parties, and I 
think there’s plenty of options and 
ways the PCCN can make this into a 
really powerful experience both for 
the students who are involved and 
the community and really be able to 
push towards carbon neutrality with 
all the resources and brainpower 
that we have here and in the area,” 
Member 2 said.
While 
Member 
2 
seemed 
optimistic for the future, Member 
1 expressed skepticism in regards 
to the University being able to take 
decisive action to lower emissions on 
campus. They argued that external 
pressure from activists was driving 
the institution to address the issue.
“U of M has been way off target in 
terms of addressing climate change,” 
Member 1 said. “The only reason we 
have this Commission in the first 
place is because of years of student 
advocacy on this front … I believe 
that we are only here because of 
people 
advocating 
and 
forcing 
the administration to form this 
Commission and have some sort of 
response to the claims that they are 
basically asleep at the wheel as we’re 
careening towards catastrophe on a 
global scale.”

 As many students struggle to 
connect with counselors who are 
decades older than they are, Hannah 
Connors, executive director of WSN 
and Public Policy senior, said she sees 
a clear benefit to the peer-led model.
“People enjoy talking to their 
peers about their problems because 
it’s easier to relate to each other,” 
Connors said. “There’s research that 
young people turn to their peers first 
when they’re struggling before going 
to a professional or a trusted adult 
just because there’s a lower barrier of 
entry and it feels comfortable and non-
intimidating.” 
WSN makes a deliberate effort to 
be accessible, with group sign-ups 
open all semester at no cost, Connors 
said. 
“Maybe you tried to get counseling 

at CAPS and you’re facing an 
undesirable wait time, WSN can 
be another piece of your coping,” 
Connors said. “It provides people at 
least some outlet to talk about things if 
they aren’t able to get into counseling 
right away.” 
Other student groups dedicated 
to mental health promotion include 
CAPS In Action, Wolverine Wellness 
PULSE and CAPS Student Advisory 
Board. These groups actively give 
feedback to professional University 
resources. 
CAPS Director Todd Sevig met 
with the CAPS Student Advisory 
Board in December to gauge student 
preferences on the time of initial 
appointments and time in between 
appointments. The meeting also 
sought 
student 
input 
on 
non-
traditional clinical options such as 
placing counselors in “non-clinical” 
settings and virtual appointments. 
Sevig says CAPS has received all of 
the Board’s responses and are going 
through them all.
Members 
of 
Central 
Student 
Government are also looking at ways 
to make mental health care more 
accessible. In 2017, CSG recommended 
improvements to University efforts 
to be implemented within one year, 
within one to three years and beyond 
three years. 
Many of the goals have been met, 
including an increased number of 
CAPS counselors, establishing a first-
year wellness course and revamping 
the CAPS office in the Michigan 
Union. 
However, 
no 
progress 
has been made on the long-term 
recommendation for a complete CAPS 
office on North Campus. 
LSA senior Sulayman Qazi ran for 
CSG representative to improve the 
University’s mental health efforts. He 
said he felt like the resources available 
on campus were inadequate for 
transfer students like himself and that 
they did not take into consideration 
uninsured students who can’t afford 
long-term care.
“I ran to direct these resources in 
the right direction,” Qazi said. “Even 
if I can’t make big changes, I want to 
at least have a discussion where people 
recognize the problems that need to be 
fixed.”
Since joining CSG, Qazi said he has 
met challenges, including a possible 
tradeoff between more funding for 
mental health services and raising the 
student health services fee.
“It’s a balancing act,” Qazi said. 
“You want to have enough money 
so these services can run perfectly, 
but at the same time, we don’t want 
to alienate anybody who might feel 
they’re putting a lot of money into a 
system that they’re not using. I’d hope 
students would look at it from the 
perspective of the greater community 
that uses these services.”
Wolverine Wellness 
Wolverine Wellness, the public 
health branch of University Health 
Services, is known for initiatives 
including free condoms in the 
residence halls, rapid HIV testing and 
the Stay in the Blue app. It also offers 
free Wellness Coaching, one-on-one 
conversations with a trained graduate 
student to guide students through 
common challenges of well-being in 
college. 
According 
to 
Director 
Mary 
Jo 
Desprez, 
Wellness 
Coaching 
represents a shift in strategy from 
specialized appointments in content-
specific areas such as alcohol, sexual 
health and body image issues to a 
more holistic approach in student 
well-being.
“Students come to us as a beautiful 
combination of lots of those issues,” 
Desprez said. “They will come see 
me and say, ‘I don’t know if I used a 
condom last night because I was so 
drunk,’ or ‘I’m saving all my calories 
for the bar.’”
Previously feeling isolated as an 
out-of-state student and a freshman 
living 
on 
North 
Campus, 
LSA 
sophomore Delaney Walsh went to 
Wolverine Wellness last year and had 
a positive experience with Wellness 

Coaching.
“I think it feels like specific care, 
maybe because there are less people,” 
Walsh said. “I’ve never been to CAPS 
but it seems like it’s more quantity over 
quality there. Wolverine Wellness 
is nice because it’s smaller and their 
questions are easily answerable.”
According to a Wolverine Wellness 
report obtained by The Daily, 464 
students utilized Wellness Coaching 
over the past two academic years, 
but the resource is still not as widely 
utilized as CAPS, which took in more 
than 4,500 new clients in just one 
year. Out of 11 University students 
interviewed for this story, only one 
mentioned Wolverine Wellness when 
asked about mental health resources 
on campus. 
While Desprez emphasized that 
Wolverine Wellness does not offer 
clinical psychological services like 
CAPS or UHS, she said the program 
is looking at a number of avenues to 
reach students more effectively.
“I would say our partnership 
with Housing is a big one,” Desprez 
said. “We try to reach out to RAs a 
lot, and also partnerships with all 
of our other colleagues. CAPS can 
refer students and rec sports can 
refer students. One of the things I’m 
hopeful for is the syllabus statement. 
Wolverine Wellness and all the well-
being resources on campus will be 
in it, so if you sign up for four classes 
and see that syllabus statement four 
times you’ll hopefully be saying, ‘All 
right already, I get it that Wolverine 
Wellness is a thing.’”
Peer Collaborations
In the CAPS 2018-2019 annual 
report, 36 percent of students said 
they heard about CAPS from a friend. 
That is a 12-percent increase from the 
second-largest category, which is the 
CAPS website. Sevig told The Daily 
that students encouraging each other 
to focus on mental health will increase 
the usage of all the resources available. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“The number one is a friend,” 
Sevig said. “It’s not (an) email from 
me. It’s not communications from 
communications. It’s not our website. 
It’s not a faculty. It’s a friend. It’s a great 
recurrence on our campus and it’s 
different from other campuses. That 
means two things. One, that there is 
an increased comfortability among 
students to actually talk and address 
mental health. Two, it also means 
that there’s a huge increase in student 
energy and advocacy.”
Even though Music, Theatre & 
Dance sophomore Helen LaGrand 
has never used CAPS, she said she has 
referred her friends to the service. She 
recognizes that not all students come 
to the University knowing the benefits 
of mental health counseling and that 
peers are often the link between 
struggling students and available 
resources.
“I have a pretty good support 
system outside of school. I’m really 
close to my family and my parents are 
really supportive of my mental health,” 
LaGrand said. “But I have friends who 
don’t have that support system and it’s 
really hard for them going to college 
and not really knowing where to turn 
to.”
In light of the number of students 
turning to CAPS on the basis of 
peer referrals, Sevig told The Daily 
he would like to see more peer 
collaborations within CAPS.
“Another thing is that I would love 
to see a huge increase and inclusion 
in peer support and peer counseling,” 
Sevig said. “I would like to see the 
possibility of some peer individual 
counseling, 
peer 
programming, 
workshops, peer education around 
mental health.”
Group therapy is one example of 
the peer collaborations within CAPS 
— there are other groups such as 
#Anxietytoolbox, 
#Blackgirlmagic 
and Graduate Women’s Group. CAPS 
currently runs these programs every 
semester, developing new ones each 
year. Sevig said he encourages these 
group sessions because it encompasses 
the vision he sees for peer support 
within CAPS.
“The idea for group therapy, 
support groups and workshops is that 
you get support from other people, not 
just the professionals,” Sevig said. “It 
actually normalizes it.”
Faculty Training 
CAPS created a faculty toolkit 
explaining how to respond to different 
situations of students struggling 
with mental health issues. This 
toolkit provides negative and positive 
example scenarios when introducing 
CAPS in the syllabus, confidentiality 
and creating an inclusive classroom 
community, among other topics. 
Students told The Daily they had 
experienced both types of situations.
LSA sophomore Noelle Seward said 
she had negative experiences with her 
professors, emphasizing their lack 
of empathy when she reached out to 
them for support.
“So many professors go into the 
beginning of the semester preaching 
that they’re so understanding about 

mental health and they think that all 
these things they have in their syllabus 
are enough,” Seward said. “I feel like 
my professors were preaching how 
they’re understanding and that they 
get it. But when you actually could use 
some help, they’re like, ‘That sucks 
for you.’ It’s very crushing. I feel like 
there are resources, but they’re not 
accessible to students.” 
LSA freshman Ishita Shukla did not 
have trouble with her rigorous classes 
in high school, but she struggled to 
adjust when she started her courses 
on campus. As a result, she said her 
exam grades faltered and she started 
to experience exam anxiety. Once she 
recognized her situation, Shukla said 
she reached out for help.
“I was taking Bio 171 this year and 
I felt like exam anxiety was getting 
in the way,” Shukla said. “The course 
coordinator met with me and she 
sent me her own list of exam anxiety 
strategies. I followed it and I did a lot 
better on my final exam than I did on 
my other exams.”
LaGrand said she saw a lack of 
community in the large classes she 
took in LSA. She said she believes that 
strong social ties in academic settings 
are important to students’ mental 
health.
“A lot of mental health stuff for 
me comes from being connected to 
people. If I don’t feel mentally good, 
it’s because I don’t feel connected to 
people,” LaGrand said. “I feel like 
ways to facilitate more connections 
in class (is having) professors or 
GSIs encouraging more conversation 
between people in classes. This is such 
a huge school and you’re on the run all 
the time so you don’t necessarily see 
the same people all the time.”
CAPS Outreach
During the Union’s 20-month 
renovation, CAPS relocated to the 
Tappan Auxiliary Building. Now that 
the Union has reopened, Sevig said he 
anticipates CAPS’ return to its original 
location will make their office more 
accessible.
“The Michigan Union, symbolically 
and concretely, is the center of student 
life,” Sevig said. “We’d also like being 
in a building where you can come in 
for many different reasons because 
while there is drastically less stigma, 
some students still do have stigma. 
We’re also not (on the) first floor 
where there is so much activity. We’re 
on the fourth floor next to SAPAC and 
that’s one of the biggest new things 
that we’ve never had.”
A new wellness zone is now open 
next to the CAPS office in the Union. 
The wellness zone offers massage 
chairs, yoga and meditation tools, 
seasonal 
affective 
disorder 
light 
therapy and many more resources 
focused on improving wellness among 
the student body. Sevig said that he 
was hesitant about creating a larger 
wellness zone in space that could 
have been used for additional CAPS 
offices, but the positive response to 
the existing wellness zone on North 
Campus convinced him to expand it.
“That’s why we built the wellness 
zone. We could have used the space 
for two or maybe three more small 
offices for individual work,” Sevig said. 
“Based on student input and feedback, 
we tried the wellness zone. I was a 
little nervous because if students don’t 
come to it or they don’t use it, that’s 
when quantity started to increase but 
students said this a good idea.”
Sevig told The Daily that CAPS has 
made advertising efforts for its own 
services through orientation, emails, 
website and paper material given to 
RAs. A list of additional CAPS-related 
resources is online for reference when 
counseling appointments are not 
immediately available.
“What’s cool is that a lot of students 
who have had some mental health 
challenges in high school, they find us 
right away and they seek it out,” Sevig 
said. “(But) the reality is until you need 
it at a certain time, it might go in one 
ear and out the other.”
Sevig told The Daily that CAPS was 
involved with orientation through 
the Educational Theatre Company 
and gave a presentation at the Parent 
Orientation. 
However, 
the 
ETC 
does not perform at transfer student 
orientation.
Qazi transferred to Michigan 
from a community college in Illinois. 
When Qazi attended transfer student 
orientation, he did not hear anything 
about CAPS and did not know where 
to go when he was seeking help. 
“As a transfer student, in the 
orientation, I didn’t know about 
CAPS and all those things because 
orientation was four hours long,” 
Qazi said. “So when I was having all 
these issues, I did not go to CAPS at 
all. I actually went directly to UHS 
services and through UHS they would 
end up referring me to someone else. 
But initially, before I transferred to 
Michigan, I would always just go to 
my Illinois doctors. But at Michigan, it 
was really confusing and I didn’t know 
where to go.”

Our need for labels underscores our discomfort with the LGBTQ+
W

ith the release of his 
newest album and a 
stark gender-bending 
fashion 
sense, 
musician 
Harry 
Styles became the latest victim of 
intense questioning and pressure to 
label “what” he was. We frequently 
see this labeling game take place 
when a gay, lesbian or bisexual 
person marks their “coming out.” 
But what does a formal statement 
translate to when it comes to 
everyday interactions with LGBTQ+ 
individuals? It seems to be a way for 
people to compare that person to a 
stereotype they already have formed 
in their heads for their own comfort 
and understanding. The labels we 
rely on to describe members of the 
LGBTQ+ community serve to limit 
them and reflect our need to stick to 
what we already understand, rather 
than challenging our preconceived 
notions of sexual identity and gender 
expression.
Many of the labels slapped on 
members of the community dictate 
the way others perceive a person, 
rather than relying on personal 
connections formed. Referring to 
your friends as your “gay best friend” 
or “trans friend” limits them and 
often puts them in an uncomfortable 
or vulnerable position before they 
even have a chance to speak. In 
addition, it reflects a need for straight 
individuals to prove something of 
themselves as if having a gay friend 
is an accessory to wear. With these 
labels branded on the community’s 
forehead, 
individuals 
feel 
as 
though they’re filling a role and 
satisfying 
someone’s 
stereotype 
of how members of the LGBTQ+ 
community are supposed to be 
presenting 
themselves. 
This 
pressure to satisfy stereotypes and 
be understood is reflected across 
popular culture.
Recently, Styles was interviewed 
by The Guardian, where he was 
pushed to define his sexuality after 
they accused him of pandering to 
the LGBTQ+ community. To the 
question of sexuality, he responded, 
“Who cares?” The theories spread 

across social media and the influx 
of articles pinpointing his sexuality 
based on clues reflect society’s need 
to label and place individuals into 
palatable and comfortable boxes. 
Styles went on to add that he dresses 
“not because it makes me look gay, 
or it makes me look straight or it 
makes me look bisexual,” but rather 
without 
labeled 
boundaries 
of 
feminine or masculine. His general 
indifference to the question and 
desire for ambiguity in his identity 
are reflective of the approach society 
should strive for. 
The societal desire to label 
someone or something as “gay” or 
“lesbian” emulates a sense of power 
over the community by deciding 
what their identity says about them 
and how they are to be viewed 
within the confines of a stereotype. 
Furthermore, the boxes individuals 
are placed in allows for society’s 
perception of that identity to confine 
someone and steer them towards 
traditional paths or be deterred from 
activities, based on the way they’ll be 
perceived. These labels historically 
carry negative connotations and 
can be oppressive, thus leading 
to a second-class status for the 
community. Straight people already 
understand the malice in these labels 
when they are offended by someone 
who mistakenly refers to them 
as LGBTQ+, as seen with Shawn 
Mendes’ case of feeling pressured to 
prove that he’s not gay.
“Coming out” is a held practice 
in which those in the LGBTQ+ 
community 
publically 
define 
themselves in an effort to distinguish 
themselves and begin the cycle of 
labeling. The process ostracizes those 
who hold these identities because 
straight individuals feel no pressure 
to announce their sexuality to others, 
rather it is presumed. By “coming 
out” we seemingly make the process 
of 
labeling 
and 
understanding 
easier for straight individuals who 
otherwise would not have known 
what to refer to us as.
This societal desire to label 
becomes even more complicated for 

those who fit multiple categories or 
fall into a gray area, such as those 
who are bisexual or pansexual. 
With less available stereotypes 
and a need to pin a person down, 
the idea of “percentages” arises, 
which is a common practice of 
determining how gay or straight 
a bisexual or pansexual person is 
based on what gender they prefer 
more or less. With this confinement 
of sexual expression, people often 
perpetuate bisexual erasure by 
limiting their sexuality to a category 
more comfortable to them instead of 
embracing their fluidity and actual 
orientation.
Bisexual erasure and the need 
for labeling are not limited to 
the straight community, rather 
it is perpetuated through the 
LGBTQ+ community by an added 
pressure of categorizing yourself 
within your overarching label. 
This is especially prevalent in the 
dating scene as many LGBTQ+-
identifying individuals present 
themselves in “tribes” and express 
their preferred label, leading to 
hierarchies 
and 
perpetuating 
the toxic behavior exhibited by 
oppressors. 
The 
systemic 
desire 
to 
label and limit others reflects 
society’s discomfort with the 
LGBTQ+ 
community 
because 
it demonstrates the need for 
us to fit a stereotype to be 
understood. This practice of 
labeling stretches from simple 
“coming outs” to chart-topping 
musicians when someone strays 
from society’s expectation of 
expression. Instead of using 
labels 
for 
individuals, 
rely 
instead on similarities, passions 
and connections to humanize 
a person rather than belittling 
them to a comfortable stereotype. 
Assigning labels to members of 
the community perpetuates the 
less-than-understanding 
that 
comes along with stereotypes 
and limits rather than liberates.

Campus carbon neutrality efforts should prioritize reevaluation
S

ince the spring of 2019, the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
campus 
has 
experienced 
several major events regarding how 
we — the city of Ann Arbor and 
University campus — are responding 
to the current global climate crisis.
Some of the major events include 
two climate strikes and one recent 
incident in which civil protesters 
were arrested. At the same time, 
the 
University’s 
administration 
took its first major strides toward 
reducing the detrimental effects of 
our campus on the climate. Since 
the launching of the President’s 
Commission on Carbon Neutrality 
in February 2019, we can certainly 
consider the action taken by the 
University thus far as satisfactory 
and 
progressive. 
However, 
going forward, it’s important to 
recognize that some aspects of 
the commission’s plan should be 
adjusted to better serve the public 
opinion toward how the climate 
crisis should be addressed in our city. 
The President’s Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
is 
composed of faculty, students, 
local administrators and other 
local partners. It was formed to 
address 
several 
responsibilities 
and a timeline for creating a final 
recommendation 
to 
University 
President Mark Schlissel for how 
administrative action should be 
taken to achieve carbon neutrality. 
The timeline — beginning in Fall 
2018 and ending in Fall 2020 
— is divided into three phases, 
throughout which the commission 
is expected to achieve specific 
goals. Given the actions currently 
outlined in the timeline, there 
should be a general designated 
effort to reevaluate this process of 
composing a final plan for Schlissel 
in order to consider implementable 
improvements 
to 
the 
process 
along the way. This would allow 
the commission to improve the 
execution of its purpose: to evaluate 
the ways in which the University 
can achieve carbon neutrality and 
sustain it for the future. 
The first phase of the PCCN 
plan, spanning from February 
2019 to November 2019, deals with 
creating plans to address the major 
challenges of achieving carbon 
neutrality and establishing a shared 
understanding among commission 

members of these major challenges 
going forward. Specifically, the 
commission is set to define a plan to 
address the complexities of carbon 
neutrality, 
educate 
community 
members on their work, secure 
the expertise necessary to evaluate 
complexities, create a unanimous 
outlook on these complexities 
and compose an interim progress 
report. 
During these months of the 
first phase, the commission has 
successfully begun to evaluate 
forthcoming 
challenges 
and 
establish 
an 
all-encompassing 
perspective of which areas on 
campus need adjustments and 
which 
subsequent 
areas 
will 
be affected by the predicted 
adjustments. 
However, 
the 
commission 
lacks 
prioritizing 
a 
mentality 
of 
reevaluation 
as they engage in the process 
of determining the best way 
to approach the challenges of 
achieving carbon neutrality. In 
that way, this commission should 
constantly reevaluate whether or 
not their approach to addressing 
these 
challenges 
continues 
to 
be successful. This allows the 
commission to make alterations 
necessary 
for 
improving 
the 
process.
The second phase of the PCCN 
plan, spanning from November 
2019 to May 2020, deals with 
evaluating 
options 
shown 
by 
analyses teams and continuing to 
establish a shared understanding 
among commission members of 
the major challenges in achieving 
carbon neutrality. Specifically, the 
commission is set to engage experts 
in 
informing 
analyses 
teams, 
evaluate recommendations made 
by analyses teams, further define 
aspects of the challenges, create 
a unanimous outlook on these 
challenges and compose another 
interim progress report. 
During the months of this next 
phase, I find that the commission 
could benefit more by establishing 
permanent 
staff 
positions 
in 
analysis teams in addition to 
the faculty advisors that lead 
them. More importantly, I find it 
imperative that the commission 
works to expand both staff and 
student involvement in the social 
justice sub-group because of the 

important 
correlation 
between 
poor 
environmental 
conditions 
and 
significant 
socioeconomic 
disparities. In that way, this 
commission 
should 
continue 
building their staff and other 
administrative personnel involved 
in their analysis teams and sub-
groups in order to create the 
most informed and well-versed 
evaluations of the challenges as 
possible. 
The third phase of the PCCN 
plan, spanning from May 2020 
to December 2020, deals with 
making final consultations and 
creating a final report for achieving 
carbon neutrality to Schlissel. 
Specifically, the commission is set 
to allow stakeholders to evaluate 
final 
recommendations, 
draft 
a final list of recommendations 
for public input and deliver a 
final revised report to Schlissel. 
During the months of this final 
phase — and realistically for each 
of the phases — the outcome of 
the commission could be most 
satisfactory if public engagement 
is prioritized during the process. 
In that way, this commission 
should work to promote public 
involvement further and continue 
to emphasize the importance of 
discussing actions taken for our 
campus and our city to become 
carbon neutral. 
Above 
all, 
I 
encourage 
everyone — as a community and 
as a public student body — to 
involve yourself more in the plans 
and 
developments 
currently 
being made in our city in order 
to have an influence on this 
system that is made to serve us. 
The President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality exhibits great 
intentions that our campus should 
be proud of, but that they could 
benefit from the feedback and 
input we give about the policies 
they materialize in their report 
to Schlissel on how to approach 
achieving carbon neutrality. In 
the end, this effort will take 
the involvement of everyone 
in order to be successful, and 
we ought to feel concerned 
about our future whether we 
want to work for it or not.

Minding the orgasm gap

W

hile the 1989 rom-
com 
classic 
“When 
Harry Met Sally” may 
seem a little too old to be relevant 
on the modern college campus, 
one of the movie’s most climactic 
moments has become a cultural 
icon. Whether they’ve seen the film 
or not, most people would likely 
recognize the scene in which Sally 
challenges Harry’s ability to tell a 
real orgasm from a fake one, giving 
a loud demonstration of the latter in 
a crowded café and producing the 
often-repeated line, “I’ll have what 
she’s having.” This scene serves as 
one of the most pervasive on-screen 
portrayals of the female orgasm — 
quite telling, then, that the orgasm 
depicted is unambiguously fake.
To the film’s credit, the scene 
probably wouldn’t have had the 
chance to become so iconic if the 
orgasm was not explicitly fake. While 
the film did receive an R-rating for 
profanity and vulgarity, it almost 
certainly would have been hit with 
a highly restrictive NC-17 rating had 
they shown Sally sincerely enjoying 
sex — especially oral sex. That’s right 
— the MPAA considers both drug 
abuse and intense violence more 
appropriate for viewing by children 
than the explicit female orgasm, 
despite the fact that women are 
often highly sexualized in popular 
films. Simultaneously portraying 
women as sexual while refusing 
to acknowledge their pleasure 
contributes to the prevalence of 
female objectification. Even the 
theoretically 
equivalent 
male 
orgasm is widely viewed as more 
acceptable to show in movies.
This 
orgasm 
inequality 
is 
certainly not limited to the silver 
screen. The existence of a gender pay 
gap is established and well-known, 
but women are consistently shorted 
fair compensation in many measures 
beyond their salary, including the 
frequency of achieving the Big O. 
Female college students consistently 
report having an orgasm during 
intimate encounters — both within 
hookups and relationships — less 
than their male counterparts, with 
the largest difference being an 
astounding 32 percent. As I’ve said 
previously, emotional and mental 
factors are just as crucial to safe, 
healthy sex as physical factors. 
This includes the recognition and 
fulfillment of desires and pleasures. 
It’s about time we come to widely 
acknowledge closing the orgasm 
gap as part of the fight for gender 

equality. We need to get comfortable 
talking about it, too, as open 
discussion is often an important step 
in the path toward reconciliation. We 
have a lot of catching up to do, but 
improving our personal and cultural 
understanding of the female orgasm 
gives us a good place to start.
While the term ‘orgasm gap’ 
is fairly new, gender inequality in 
terms of sexuality is not a recent 
development. Women have been 
receiving the short end of the stick 
when it comes to sexual pleasure 
for centuries. In fact, female sexual 
desire was so misunderstood it used 
to be pathologized as hysteria, a 
diagnosable illness in need of a cure 
which — somewhat ironically — 
led to the invention of the vibrator. 
Hysteria remained in the American 
Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders until 1980, and while it 
has since been removed, gender 
inequalities when it comes to the 
understanding 
and 
acceptance 
of pleasure and desire remain an 
issue. The statistics about orgasm 
frequency demonstrate the results 
of this misunderstanding. According 
to a 2017 article from the Archives of 
Sexual Behavior, heterosexual men 
are most likely to orgasm from sexual 
intimacy, while landing in last place 
is — you guessed it — heterosexual 
women. It’s not even close, either, 
with 95 percent of heterosexual 
men reporting they usually orgasm 
during sex, compared with just 65 
percent of heterosexual women. This 
already significant difference widens 
to 52 percent when the population is 
narrowed down to college students, 
with just 39 percent of female 
respondents reporting they usually 
or always experience orgasm during 
partnered sex in one survey. These 
numbers make it clear that the issue 
of orgasm inequality is undeniable, 
especially on college campuses.
Obviously, this massive gap isn’t 
going to close itself, and in order to 
realize 
statistical 
improvements, 
we need to recognize the factors 
leading to inequality. Laurie Mintz, 
a psychology professor at the 
University of Florida, cites cultural 
misunderstandings 
and 
myths 
surrounding female anatomy as 
the “number one reason for the 
orgasm gap,” along with inaccurate 
media depictions of sex and the 
under-valuing of female sexuality 
— especially when compared to the 
over-privileging of male sexuality. 
This over-privileging includes the 

cultural definition of penetrative 
sex as the primary form of sexual 
behavior — it’s widely considered 
the “main event” in any intimate 
encounter, with other behaviors 
being secondary supporters of 
penetration rather than independent 
and equally valid forms of sex. In 
fact, many people don’t even believe 
sex without a penetrative element to 
truly be ‘sex.’ This creates issues for 
people of varying gender and sexual 
identities (for example, the cultural 
question of “How do lesbians have 
sex?”) 
including 
heterosexual 
women. Their desires, pleasures 
and, 
yes, 
their 
orgasms, 
are 
neglected and reduced as a result of 
the heteronormative prioritization 
of penetrative sex.
With the scale of the orgasm 
gap established and the factors 
that create it laid out, we can 
work to mitigate, and possibly 
eliminate, this inequality.
First, we’re going to need to 
do a bit of brushing up on our 
anatomy. Ideally, American sex 
education should be improved 
to include a more comprehensive 
understanding 
of 
sexual 
desires and pleasures and their 
connection to anatomy. But for 
those of us beyond high school 
sex-ed, our learning likely is 
of our own initiative. Luckily 
enough, the Internet provides 
a vast number of resources for 
learning more about female 
anatomy. 
The 
University 
of 
Michigan offers some resources, 
as well, and if you have time 
between 
double 
majors 
and 
distribution 
requirements, 
consider using a few credits to 
take a course on women’s health.
On a macro-level, we need to 
reassess our cultural agreement 
on 
what 
constitutes 
“real” 
sex. Instead of heterosexual 
penetration being considered the 
ultimate form of sex, we must 
begin to see it as one of many 
equally valid forms of intimacy. 
This societal reconsideration of 
sex will be a continuous progress, 
as will closing the orgasm gap. 
But a dedicated progression 
toward 
improvement 
should 
certainly be seen as a form of 
success. The day when we can 
all “have what she’s having” — in 
equal proportions, of course — 
can’t come soon enough.

Thursday, January 16, 2020 — 5A

In a blow to Michigan’s 
2020 defensive line, defensive 
tackle 
Michael 
Dwumfouor 
announced Tuesday afternoon 
that 
he 
had 
entered 
the 
transfer portal.
“My time here at Michigan 
has come to an end, these 
past four years has been some 
of the best time of my life,” 
Dwumfour 
wrote 
in 
a 
statement 
posted 
to 
Twitter. 
“I’ve 
learned 
and 
matured 
so 
much 
here, 
I’ve 
built 
relationships 
with 
people 
that will last 
a 
lifetime. 
I 
would like to thank Coach 
(Jim) Harbaugh, Coach (Don) 
Brown, Coach (Shaun) Nua, 
Coach (Ben Herbert) and staff 
and the athletic training staff 
for all they’ve done for me. 
With that said, I have entered 
the portal and will be a Grad 
transfer. God Bless.”
In 2019, Dwumfour finished 
with nine tackles and 1.5 
tackles 
for 
loss, 
getting 
rotational 
snaps 
on 
the 

interior and starting against 
Indiana and Ohio State. He 
did not travel with the team 
to the Citrus Bowl against 
Alabama after undergoing a 
medical procedure, news that 
Dwumfour revealed via an 
Instagram post in which he 
was at a Detroit Lions home 
game instead of in Orlando 
with the team.
As 
a 
graduate 
transfer, 
Dwumfour 
will 
have 
immediate eligibility wherever 
he goes.
In 
2020, 
Michigan 
will 
be 
dependent 
on 
Chris 
Hinton 
and 
Mazi 
Smith, 
who redshirted 
last 
season 
as 
freshmen, 
to take a step 
forward 
on 
the 
interior. 
Though it seems likely that 
Carlo Kemp will be granted 
a fifth year of eligibility and 
retain his starting spot, nothing 
has been made official. Jess 
Speight also worked himself 
into the rotation towards the 
end of the year, including in 
the Citrus Bowl.
The Wolverines’ defensive 
line ranked 12th in sack rate 
and 25th in opposing line 
yards, per Football Outsiders.

Wolverines suffer defeat in opener
LBs coach Campanile to Dolphins, 
Michael Dwumfour to grad transfer

Just one day after Rutgers 
hired Robb Smith as its defensive 
coordinator 
— 
seemingly 
meaning 
that 
Michigan 
would 
retain 
linebackers 
coach Anthony Campanile — 
Campanile is gone.
The New Jersey native has 
accepted a job as an assistant 
coach for the Miami Dolphins, 
per Yahoo’s Pete Thamel. His 
role is unclear as of now. 
Retaining 
Campanile 
had 
been 
of 
utmost 
importance 
for the Wolverines, especially 
after 
former 
special 
teams 
coordinator Chris Partridge left 
to take a defensive coordinator 
job with Ole Miss. Campanile, a 
New Jersey native, is from the 
state and played college football 
as a linebacker at Rutgers from 
2001-04. Those ties helped him 
with recruiting efforts in New 
Jersey, where Michigan has 
found fertile recruiting ground 
under 
Jim 
Harbaugh. 
The 
Wolverines have now lost their 
two coaches with the strongest 
ties to the state.
Rutgers and Michigan had 
fought it out for Campanile’s 
services over the last few weeks, 
with 
Campanile 
eventually 
turning 
down 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights’ defensive coordinator 
job. According to NJ.com, he 
was expected to get a pay raise 
at Michigan, with a potentially 
new title. His name had also 
come up in rumors for Boston 
College’s defensive coordinator 
job.
Campanile will owe Michigan 
25 percent of his $415,000 
annual salary under his buyout 
clause.
The Wolverines now must 
replace two of their assistant 
coaches. 
Under 
Harbaugh, 
Michigan has yet to go an 
offseason without turnover on 
the coaching staff.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Redshirt junior Michael Dwumfour announced his decision to transfer.

These past four 
years have been 
some of the best 
time of my life.

Michigan’s No. 5 singles player, 
junior Harrison Brown, found 
himself down, 5-2, in the third set 
of what had become the deciding 
match of the evening. 
Brown immediately responded 
to the adversity with an ace. He 
added two more on his way to tying 
the match, 5-5. 
Yet 
North 
Carolina 
State’s 
Tristan Smith ended Brown’s 
comeback in a crushing tie-
breaker, sealing the match for the 
Wolfpack. 
Late-game 
heroics 
were 
a 
common theme at the Varsity 
Tennis Center Wednesday evening, 
as the 17th-ranked Wolverines (0-1) 
fell to No. 23 North Carolina State 
(1-0), 4-3, in their season opener. 
A combination of finesse and 
domination at the net allowed the 
Wolfpack to jump out to a lead in all 
three doubles matches. 
The No. 1 doubles tandem of 
sophomore Andrew Fenty and 
junior Mattias Siimar were able to 
counter their early deficit through 
a clinic at the net to notch a 6-4 
victory.
With the doubles point hanging 
in the balance, the duo of senior 
Connor Johnston and Ondrej 
Styler found themselves down, 6-5.
The one-two punch of Styler’s 
serve and Johnston’s net play 
helped them climb back, taking 
the set, 7-6, and earning the 
Wolverines their first point of the 
match, and the season. 
Styler struggled in his debut at 
No. 2 singles against Tadas Babelis, 
quickly falling behind in a 6-3 first-
set defeat. 
The more experienced Babelis 
was able to stall Styler’s second-
set surge, securing a 6-4 victory, 
winning 
the 
match 
for 
the 
Wolfpack. 
Siimar found himself in a 
highly-competitive No. 3 singles 
match. Endless rallies became the 
norm as he and Yannai Barkaie 
traded blows. 
The seasoned Siimar was able 
to pick and choose his moments en 
route to a 6-4, 6-2 victory.

Nick 
Beaty’s 
crippling 
groundstrokes propelled him to 
a 6-2 first-set victory in his No. 
6 singles match against Martins 
Rocens. 
Rocens came out firing in the 
second set, earning a 4-1 lead and 
capping off a 6-3 victory with an 
ace. 
Beaty’s 
continued 
baseline 
dominance helped him prevail in a 
6-3 third-set victory. 
At No. 4 singles, Johnston’s 
ability to track down any ball was 
quickly put to the test against Rafa 
Luque’s pinpoint accuracy. 
The senior rose to the occasion 
after dropping the first game 
to take 5-2 break. Luque came 
storming back, rattling off five 
straight games, handing Johston a 
crushing 7-5 first-set defeat.
“The thing with him is he has to 
serve better and he would be able 
to hold on to those leads a little 
bit easier,” Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg said. “He’s a senior he’s 
got to control that.”
Johnston flipped the script 
in the second set, winning three 
straight games after falling behind, 
4-1, albeit in a 6-4 losing effort. 
“He fought back, he always 
will,” Steinberg said. “He’s an 
amazing fighter. He loves college 
tennis so much.”
In his debut at No. 1 singles, 
Fenty lost his first six points, 
quickly falling behind and losing 
the first set, 6-1. 
The reigning NCAA Rookie of 
the Year came out rejuvenated in 
the second set, jumping out to a 
4-1 lead in a dominant 6-1 first-set 

victory. 
“He competed great,” Steinberg 
said. “In the beginning of the 
second set he hung in there, still 
wasn’t playing great, but he fought 
through some tough games.”
Fenty found himself down 
4-3 in the third set, but quickly 
recaptured the momentum with 
an emphatic ace followed by a 
swinging volley that ignited an 
“Andrew Fenty” chant resonating 
throughout the Varsity Tennis 
Center. 
Nevertheless, Alexis Galarneau 
kept Fenty’s hot streak at bay, 
taking the next break, 5-4, and 
winning the set, 6-4.
Brown’s 
valiant 
comeback 
effort was the silver lining in a 
heartbreaking 
ending 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
“To see that was great, almost a 
victory in itself for him to get all the 
way to being up, 3-1, in the breaker,” 
Steinberg said. “He started to 
really play aggressive and really hit 
the ball and he’s capable of that.”
While resilience was on full 
display for Michigan, it didn’t show 
up on the scoreboard.
“Our movement and racket 
speed at the beginning of matches 
needs to be better,” Steinberg said. 
“I thought we needed to warm 
up before the match with better 
intensity and better fight.
“I think our guys were like, ‘Oh 
wow, this is college tennis again. I 
forgot how hard these other teams 
are gonna fight against us.’ I think 
they got a wake up call. It takes a 
lot to get four points against these 
teams.”

Wagner gaining coaches’ trust

Months 
ago, 
during 
Michigan’s media day, associate 
head coach Phil Martelli raved 
about freshman forward Franz 
Wagner.
“He’s just different,” Martelli 
said on Oct. 17. “I suggest, if 
you’re on the fence or there 
are tickets available, get your 
tickets. You’re gonna want to 
see this kid play.”
Fans soon learned they’d 
have to wait when Wagner 
fractured his wrist in practice 
just three days later. He missed 
the first four games of the 
season, which the Wolverines 
won, before making his much-
anticipated college debut in 
the first game of the Battle 4 
Atlantis against Iowa State. He 
scored six points in 23 minutes 
against the Cyclones.
Like any freshman, Wagner 
was inconsistent in the games 
that followed. He had to adjust 
to the pace and physicality of 
college basketball and acquaint 
himself with a new team and 
coaching staff. 
Wagner backed up Martelli’s 
praise in games against Iowa 
and Oregon, scoring 18 and 21 
points, respectively. Bracketing 
his performance against the 
Hawkeyes, though, he scored 
a combined nine points on 
4-for-14 shooting in losses to 
Louisville and Illinois.
Wagner’s season so far can 
largely be characterized as 
up and down, boom or bust, 
occasionally 
thriving 
and 
occasionally struggling — all to 
be expected from a freshman. 
And 
yet, 
his 
confidence 
and Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard’s confidence in him has 
steadily increased over time. 
Lately, Wagner’s shot attempts 
and 
minutes 
have 
climbed 
considerably. The former might 
be a direct result of the latter, 
but both come at a time when 
the Wolverines are trying to fill 
the void left by injured starter 

Isaiah Livers. 
In the last three games, 
Wagner has scored double-
digit points and played 111 of 
130 minutes. More notably, in 
the past two contests against 
Purdue and Minnesota, Wagner 
put up a combined 29 shot 
attempts. While he hit just six in 
each and Michigan split the two 
games, Wagner’s willingness to 
shoot is a welcome sight. 
“I give it to Franz pretty much 
everyday at practice,” senior 
point guard Zavier Simpson 
said after last Thursday’s win 
over the Boilermakers. “I tell 
him to stop passing up shots, 
knock em down. I don’t pass it 
to him just because he’s open. I 
pass it to him because he’s open 
and I believe he can make the 
shot.
“I told him to shoot the ball 
… I think it was early in the 
second half. We were being 
too unselfish. Trust yourself to 
make a play.”
With Livers out indefinitely, 
the Wolverines have needed 
Wagner’s 
scoring 
from 
the 
wing. Even when Livers returns 
— rumblings are that could 
be this Friday against Iowa — 
they’ll still need it.
Michigan’s depth has recently 
come into question. After a 
hot start to the season, junior 
guard Eli Brooks’ production 
has tailed off. In the last four 
games against major conference 
opponents — Oregon, Michigan 

State, Purdue and Minnesota 
— Brooks has shot 27.5 percent 
from the field and averaged just 
4.3 points per game.
Brooks isn’t the only one 
who’s struggled. On any given 
night, senior center Jon Teske, 
the team’s leading scorer, could 
find himself relegated to the 
bench because of foul trouble. 
While sophomore guard David 
DeJulius 
and 
sophomore 
forward Brandon Johns Jr. have 
provided a spark defensively, 
their scoring production has 
been inconsistent all year.
As the Wolverines continue 
through Big Ten play, with or 
without Livers, Wagner is going 
to have to be a threat offensively. 
There’s only one way to do that 
though: shoot when given the 
opportunity. 
“Yeah, 
I’m 
feeling 
good 
when I shoot it,” Wagner said 
following his 17-point outing 
against the Golden Gophers. 
“I’m gonna stay aggressive.”
His shooting percentage isn’t 
necessarily stellar, but given 
his skill set, those shots should 
eventually fall.
As 
Martelli, 
who’s 
been 
coaching for over 40 years, 
added on media day: “He’s a 
guy that you come to practice 
everyday and then you leave 
scratching your head. To be that 
age, to be that cerebral and to be 
that pure — not to put too much 
pressure on him but he’s a rain 
man. He’s a savant.”

Turnaround doable for Wolverines

By 
many 
standards, 
the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team has had a rough few 
weeks. 
Since Dec. 22, the Wolverines 
have endured three matchups 
against 
ranked 
opponents, 
resulting in a loss to Florida 
State and two to Maryland 
— the last of which being a 
77-49 blowout — plus a loss at 
unranked Ohio State. In these 
defeats, 
Michigan 
suffered 
just about every problem a 
basketball team can face, from 
turnovers to cold shooting to 
defensive collapses. 
Still, during that span, the 
Wolverines managed to pick 
up 
blowout 
victories 
over 
Penn State and rival Michigan 
State. 
Though 
these 
wins 
do little to numb the overall 
disappointment 
from 
this 
stretch, they show Michigan 
is still capable of competing at 
a high level — if it’s having a 
good day. 
The Wolverines will need a 
lot of good days to salvage this 
season. 
The Big Ten is having one 
of its best seasons in recent 
memory, 
with 
Indiana, 
Maryland 
and 
Iowa 
all 
cracking the top 25, plus 
Rutgers and a surprisingly 
tough Northwestern team both 
receiving votes. 
“Every year, I say (the Big 
Ten) is getting better and 
better. But this is arguably 
the best that its ever been,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “Obviously they’re 
talking about 10 teams being 
in the NCAA Tournament, so 
from top to bottom the league 
is 
tremendous, 
and 
we’ve 
played a bunch of great teams 
already. It’s a grind, and I 
think our kids are adjusting to 
that, as are all the other kids in 
the league.”
To manage the grind of the 
Big Ten, the Wolverines have 

required consistent individual 
performances 
across 
the 
board. Each starter offers a 
unique skill set that can change 
a game in an instant, but tends 
to disappear in big moments. 
Take junior forward Hailey 
Brown. Her strong outside 
shooting provides the team 
more than just the three points. 
It creates space for Michigan’s 
ballhandlers to get to the 
hoop and pick up a bucket or 
a foul. But in 
the Wolverines’ 
four 
recent 
losses, she shot a 
combined 3-for-
20 from three 
— a far cry from 
her 33.9 percent 
season average. 
Then 
there’s 
sophomore 
guard 
Amy 
Dilk. 
Her 
quickness off the dribble and 
often incisive passing makes 
her a nightmare for opposing 
defenses when she’s at her 
best. As a result, she held the 
team together against Florida 
State and in the first Maryland 
game, scoring 26 and 18 points, 
respectively. But she went 
cold against Ohio State and in 
the second Maryland game, 
putting up just seven and two 
points, respectively. 
The list goes on and on. 

Michigan’s lineup is loaded 
with 
talented 
players 
that 
can be elite when they’re at 
their best. But they never 
seem to be at their best at 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
that 
leads to miscommunications, 
frustration 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
confidence. 
Make no mistake, though, 
this season is far from over. 
The Wolverines are through 
the toughest part of their 
schedule, 
and 
their upcoming 
matchup 
with 
a 
struggling 
Wisconsin 
team 
will 
give them an 
opportunity 
to clean up the 
errors and get 
a few players 
going. 
And many of 
them have been here before. 
Last season, Michigan lost 
five of seven in the month 
of January, before an 8-1 
finish to the regular season 
propelled the Wolverines to a 
strong showing in the Big Ten 
Tournament — where they lost 
to conference-best Maryland 
by only one point. 
A repeat of that won’t be 
easy.
But Michigan has shown 
that it is doable.

Dakota Raabe undeterred after being kept out of lineup against Irish

There 
was 
no 
jersey 
embroidered with the number 12 
left to greet Dakota Raabe, the 
then-freshman forward. Bags 
filled with his equipment laid to 
the side. There were no helmet 
or pads hanging in the top-shelf 
bins.
If he looked, the only thing 
he’d see was his name plate and 
an empty locker under it. No 
skates dangling below on the 
bottom rack.
“We gave him a week off to 
make sure he did what he was 
supposed 
to 
do,” 
Michigan 
hockey coach Mel Pearson said, 
“and took the hockey away from 
him.”
At 
the 
time, 
it 
was 
an 
academic issue. He wasn’t living 
up to the team’s standards and 
expectations and broke the trust 
of the coaches when it pertained 
to classes. 
So they sent him a message. 
Don’t live up to the team’s 
standards, and they’ll take away 
the thing every hockey player 
cares about: hockey.
But 
last 
weekend 
was 
a 
different case. It was no longer 
academic. It was an on-ice 
issue, and ultimately, an off-ice 
coaching decision. Earlier in 
the year, the Wolverines were 
allowed to bring the entirety 
of the roster, but now they can 
only bring 23 players, leaving six 
behind to sit at home and watch 
from afar. And it was up to the 
coaches to decide who those six 
were going to be.
Immediately after practice 
last Wednesday evening, the 
coaches gathered the players in 
a room, sat them down behind 
closed doors and explained the 
new Big Ten travel rules. But the 
players knew what was coming. 
They knew just 23 could go. 
They just didn’t know which 
six were going to be left behind. 
That meeting was to let them 
know.
Emil Orhvall. Shane Switzer. 
Jack Leavy. Adam Winborg. Jay 
Keranan. Dakota Raabe.
Upon 
learning 
he 
wasn’t 
chosen 
to 
go, 
Raabe 
was 
surprised — and disappointed. It 

was the first time the junior had 
been held out of the lineup since 
his freshman year.
But poor play and end results 
had forced Pearson and the 
coaching staff’s hands to make 
some sort of change to spark the 
team.
“You’re always in conflict,” 
Pearson said. “As a coach, you’d 
like to take everybody, but I 
think we have to get to a certain 
point where we have to make 
changes if things aren’t working, 
and you have to be ready to make 
those changes. That was a good 
change.”
This time, the message was 
just as transparent as it was 
Raabe’s freshman year. There 
was no need to empty a locker 
or throw aside his equipment. 
Instead, Michigan opted to fill 

that same seat on the bus with 
a different body, one who would 
help bring the impact they so 
desperately sought.
The end result was a weekend 
sweep against No. 14 Notre 
Dame.
“It’s 
tough,” 
Raabe 
said. 
“Biggest thing is just seeing the 
team success.
“Obviously, you want to be a 
part of it. You want to be there 
but you can’t, can’t pout about it. 
That’s the most important thing 
is we got those two wins, we got 
those six points and helped us in 
the standings. And that’s all you 
can ask for really.”
He watched the wins on 
television with the remaining 
five teammates left behind. He 
cheered when Michigan scored 
and celebrated when his team 

won, hoping his wishes of good 
luck helped them succeed.
When the games ended, so 
did his time off. Pearson had 
left him and five others behind, 
but he also left behind a clear 
template of what they need to 
do to have more opportunities. 
So the weekend’s games weren’t 
the only thing they spent time 
watching. Pearson had given 
Raabe a list and video of things 
he needed to improve on.
“It’s not all just offense, 

even though he’s got one goal,” 
Pearson said. “Production is 
down … So we just felt it, he 
wasn’t doing a lot of things in 
practice and we kept playing 
him because of, you know, he 
adds some speed.
“Dakota’s been told, you know, 
things you got to work harder, 

pay more attention to defensive 
detail because he’s not scoring 
a lot. Then use the speed more, 
like he’s might be the fastest guy 
on our team, but we don’t see 
that enough.”
That was the caveat. He was 
fast, but that was it. His utility 
on the penalty kill and ability 
to put pressure on the opposing 
puck handler was valuable but 
he was, more or less, a black hole 
on offense, and at times, defense.
Raabe had trouble finishing 
his chances. He took egregious 
and unnecessary penalties. He 
would make turnovers in the 
defensive zone that frustrated 
Pearson to no end. And so 
Pearson gave him a message and 
took hockey away from him.
“You 
could 
tell 
players 
things, but one thing that they 

really hold dear is the ice time,” 
Pearson said. “You can tell them 
this or that, but when you take 
that opportunity or that ice time 
away from them, then it hits 
home a little bit more. 
“That’s the ultimate hammer 
is the ice time.”
In the past, the Wolverines 
have sat captains. They’ve sat 
hard workers and hustle players. 
The reason being the same: They 
weren’t playing to their potential 
or standard of play.
So for Raabe, it was no 
different. Seven points in 20 
games, while being a wild card 
on defense, was not going to 
cut it. But he understood the 
message and came into the new 
week of practice undeterred 
— his mind set on making the 
lineup once again.

b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

1. Tyler The Creator, 
IGOR
IGOR is the soundtrack to falling out of 
love after an emotionally turbulent period 
of denial, as Tyler desperately tries to hold 
on to a romance he knows is fading away. 
The raw feeling imparted in IGOR is 
almost palpable: the rough textures of 
retro synths combine with peculiar drum 
patterns and distorted, pitch — shifted 
vocals to build up emotional tension. This 
tension is released with beautiful, fleeting 
flashes of weightlessness, such as the bridge 
of “I THINK” and the soulful sample in “A 
BOY IS A GUN*.” Early in the album, this 
harmonic unsteadiness creates an ironic 
contrast with lyrics such as “I think I’m 
falling in love,” this tension suggesting that 
Tyler is lying either to you or to himself 
as he struggles to free himself from the 
obsessive limerence that ties him, almost 
involuntarily, to this other person.
“But at some point you come to your 
senses”
“GONE, GONE / THANK YOU” is the 
emotional centerpiece of IGOR as Tyler 
finally accepts that his “love’s gone” after 
trying to fight back against the inevitable 
for most of the album. To my ears, IGOR 
functions as a warped, almost mocking 
companion piece to the more optimistic 
and lush Flower Boy up until the second 
half of that track, when a beautiful, fleeting 
flash of melody (“Thank you for the love”) 
unexpectedly and powerfully reaffirms the 
value of love in the face of disillusionment, 
albeit from a more mature and cautious 
perspective (“Now I’m scarred for life”). 
It’s better to have loved and lost, according 
to Tyler, even if he doesn’t feel ready to go 
through it all again at the moment (“But 
I don’t ever want to love again”). That last 
line might seem awfully pessimistic, but 
in context, melodic and lyrical, it becomes 
clear that there’s more here than meets the 
eye. Acceptance is not the end of the story. 
The final two tracks show Tyler questioning 
what the future holds. Where does he go 
from here? What does his relationship with 
this person look like now that they are no 
longer romantically involved? Has he truly 
accepted the loss, or is he still hanging on? 
Maybe if we’re lucky, one day he’ll let us 
know. 
 — Jonah Mendelson, Senior Arts Editor

2. Lana Del Rey, Norman 
Fucking Rockwell! 
“Maybe the way that I’m living is killing 
me,” sings Lana Del Rey in her 2019 album 
Norman Fucking Rockwell!, and if anything 
better summarizes the ethos of this past 
year, this writer is at a loss. It’s Del Rey’s 
undeniable, bone-cutting relevance that 
earns her such a high placement on our 
“Best Of” roundout. Norman Fucking 
Rockwell! is more than an album, more 
than Del Rey, more than any of us — it’s 
a musical transcription of the glory and 
gore of modern America. This album is 
both a love letter to and a condemnation 
of the “American Dream,” a once shining 
gold-standard that has now rusted. Maybe 
it is better to compare Norman Fucking 
Rockwell! to a time capsule: Del Rey weaves 
together an eon of America culture, from 
50’s Doris Day to contemporary pop, from 
artist Norman Rockwell to the icon herself, 
Lana Del Rey. 
Allow me to make a bold claim: Del Rey 
has never written a pointless song. Every 
lyric is carefully constructed to add layers 
of thematic depth and imagery to her songs. 
A wordsmith and master of her craft, Del 
Rey proves her chops not just from the 
sociopolitical insight of her music, but also 
in her razor-sharp skills that never dull. 
I said it once, and I’ll say it again, to round 
out the year: Listen to Norman Fucking 
Rockwell!. Consider it a mandatory exercise 
of patriotism. 
 — Maddie Gannon, Daily Arts Writer

3. Freddie Gibbs and 
Madlib, Bandana
Bandana is the long awaited follow-up 
to 2014’s Pinata. A seemingly unlikely duo 
in 2014, the collaborators curated a tour-
de-force with a blaxploitation inspired 
album that perfectly bridged Gibbs’ street 
rap with Madlib’s throwback G-Funk 

flair. The result was a nostalgic, genre-
defiant throwback that was gritty and well 
developed enough to feel contemporary. 
This is not the case with Bandana, an album 
that is just as provocative as its predecessor 
but more unhinged and in the now. Gibbs 
is all over the lyricism with Black activism 
and freedom at the very core. He paints the 
album in historical references that harken 
back to major Black figures and moments 
in history while still keeping it personal. 
This is nothing new to Gibbs, it’s a quality 
he’s had since his mixtape days — but 
here, he’s less assured of how to approach 
activism. “I can’t move the same/ I gotta 
readjust how I maneuver,” he raps on “Gat 
Damn.” Madlib’s production is robust and 
maximized, a significant departure from his 
signature lo-fi beats. Different elements and 
instruments develop the background from 
twinkling bells and spazzed-out cymbals 
on “Half Manne Half Cocaine” to “Flat 
Tummy Tea’s” jerky, warped riff. Through 
Bandana, Madlib and Gibbs further the 
strength of their teamwork, their individual 
styles bouncing off one another’s seamlessly 
for a powerful rap album.

4. 
slowthai, 
Nothing 
Great About Britain
Despite 
countless 
British 
culture 
references going over my head, this album’s 
cleverness and excellence has not been 
lost on me. Nothing Great About Britain is 
stacked with genuinely terrifying beats 
beneath slowthai’s grim tales of growing 
up in Northampton. The title is defiant 
by nature, a challenge to the prevailing 
mindset of patriotism, but slowthai shows 
love and pride for Britain through his 
storytelling. This is his story set in his home 
and slowthai doesn’t hold back one bit. On 
the rage-fueled “Doorman,” he critiques 
the wealthy through his characterization 
of a relationship with a higher-class 
woman: “I pour my heart out, she laps up 
my blood.” Then on “Gorgeous,” slowthai 
is nostalgic for the time him and the boys 
first got arrested — “Five man deep and we 
all in cuffs” — the experience made fond 
by the presence of his friends. Every word 
slowthai spits, he gives it raw. And if the 
main album wasn’t enough, slowthai’s got 
all his bases covered with six bonus tracks 
that bang even harder than the album cuts. 
“Drug Dealer” and “Polaroid” are easily the 
most scream-along-able tracks of 2019. But 
Nothing Great About Britain has a greater 
accolade: This is the punkest rap album of 
the decade.
 — Dylan Yono, Daily Arts Writer

5. Purple Mountains, 
Purple Mountains 
Purple Mountains, the project of former 
Silver Jews frontman and author of the 
acclaimed poetry collection Actual Air 
David Berman, is best summed up by 
this line from “Storyline Fever”: “Got a 
comb over cut circa Abscam sting / Make 
a better Larry than Lizard King.” It’s 
simple yet complex, chock-full of witty, 
self-referential anecdotes and esoteric 
blurbs and comparisons, all tinged with 
melancholy. Berman is strictly himself on 
Purple Mountains. He is always truthful and 
has nothing to hide, even when it hurts.
Unfortunately, Purple Mountains is the 
last album that Berman will ever release. A 
few weeks after the album’s release, he was 
found dead in an apartment in Brooklyn, 
having committed suicide. 
To be blunt, this album is deeply sad, 
but Berman expertly circumvents the 
sadness by writing captivating, catchy and, 
most importantly, congenial songs. He 
incorporates humor with all the sadness, as 
if to say it’s the only way to overcome. It is 
simultaneously and accessible, infused with 
Berman’s essence. 
Purple Mountains was Berman’s swan 
song. A beautiful, bleary-eyed, poignant 
swan song.

6. Harry Styles, Fine Line 
Masculine and feminine, moody but 
cheeky, former boyband member turned 
current sex symbol, Harry Styles knows 
a thing or two about fine lines. That’s why 
Styles’s second solo album sounds like a drive 
up the California coast, a burst of sunshine 
turned torrential downpour and a dance 

between darkness and light — sometimes 
all at once. In fact, the atmosphere Fine Line 
builds is such a distinct mixture of pop and 
rock that Styles and his promotion team 
created an imaginary island, “Eroda,” just 
to market it. 
Songs like “Golden” and “Watermelon 
Sugar” shimmer whereas stripped back 
“Falling” and “Cherry” burst. On the latter 
Styles can’t help but wonder, “Does he 
take you walking in his parents’ gallery?”, 
achingly holding onto the final syllable until 
he’s forced to rip back into the chorus. 
The lyrics on Fine Line are often sparse 
and simple, but always packed with a punch. 
“Put a price on emotion,” Styles pleads on 
the title track, “I’m looking for something 
to buy.” When the song is taken over by 
building horns and military drumming, he 
is left to insist that, “We’ll be alright.” And 
the listener wants to believe him. Maybe 
it is that easy to be everything at once. If 
anyone can do it, Styles can.

7. Danny Brown, 
uknowhatimsayin¿
The man, the myth, the legend. Danny 
Brown. After a relatively quiet three 
years mostly spent streaming on Twitch, 
Danny Brown has finally returned to the 
scene, bringing with him a new album, 
uknowhatimsayin¿, executive produced by 
none other than Q-Tip, and he’s embracing 
his elder statesman status.
A 
new 
sheriff 
is 
in 
town 
on 
uknowhatimsayin¿. Gone is the old, strung-
out, yelping Danny Brown. The new 
Danny Brown is almost a different person 
— happy, relaxed and loving life. Almost. 
uknowhatimsayin¿ may have a heavy focus 
on pure rapping, but Danny is still Danny. 
He’s still experimental, but he’s more subtle 
about it. He selected beats that sound more 
traditional on the surface, but a deeper 
look into songs like “Best Life” shows that 
they are anything but. His set-ups are 
crisp, and his punchlines are executed 
flawlessly throughout the entire album. 
There are bars aplenty as Danny Brown 
raps his ass off for the entire thirty-three 
minute runtime over art-house boom-bap 
beats. uknowhatimsayin¿ is the perfect 
introduction to this new stage of Danny 
Brown’s career.
— Jim Wilson, Daily Arts Writer

8. FKA Twigs, 
MAGDALENE
FKA twigs and her airy, seraphic vocals 
come to life in the most godly of ways on 
her second studio album, MAGDALENE. 
It is fair to say that, five years following her 
last release, twigs has created what could 
be considered a masterpiece. Without a 
doubt her most impressive and deep work 
to date, the album encapsulates all of what 
makes FKA twigs special in ways that her 
listeners haven’t heard before. She dives 
into sounds she hasn’t tried on her past 
projects with grace, taking on a variety 
of instruments and background vocals 
that she hasn’t before. She effortlessly 
tackles the concepts of religion and 
heartbreak, introducing pain and solving 
it with healing. The album completes 
itself perfectly; it doesn’t feel like any song 
doesn’t belong exactly where it is. 

FKA twigs did not need to make more of 
a presence for herself. Her initial full-length 
release, LP1, brought her to the attention 
of the mainstream public. Through doing 
a feature on A$AP Rocky’s album, Testing, 
she got even more exposure. Despite her rise 
over the years, twigs has stayed extremely 
true to the sound that gave her a name. 
While MAGDALENE is clearly her most 
well-rounded and outstanding release, it 
still sounds exactly like what an FKA twigs 
album should sound like; otherworldly. One 
of the most obvious choices for a top album 
of the year, MAGDALENE was exactly what 
the progression of FKA twigs’ discography 
should be and so much more.
— Gigi Ciulla, Daily Arts Writer

9. JPEGMAFIA, All My 
Heroes Are Cornballs
On All My Heroes Are Cornballs, 
JPEGMAFIA takes the aggressive and 
industrial spirit of his 2018 record Veteran 
and injects it with more singing and ethereal 
warmth than on any of his past projects. 

This is an album that’s jarringly discordant 
yet harmoniously smooth, outrageously 
grimy yet polished to near-perfection. In 
one moment, Peggy is singing a beautiful 
chorus, like on “Free The Frail” — “Don’t 
rely on the strength of my image, hey / If 
it’s good, then it’s good / Break it down, 
the shit is outta my hands, whoa.” Next 
thing you know, he’s spitting hilarious and 
hard raps like on “Post Verified Lifestyle” 
— “I’m treatin’ this bitch like a cuck, brrt, 
MAC, loadin’ it up.” He’s here to piss people 
off and make them uncomfortable; lines 
like “I’m not a rapper, I’m white trash 
in a mocha body” are on the gentle side. 
So many disparate elements meld into a 
genuinely experimental album. How many 
people were making music anything close 
to what JPEGMAFIA was making in 2019? 
Next to none.
— Dylan Yono, Daily Arts Writer

10. Billie Eilish, When We 
Fall Asleep, Where Do We 
Go?
At just eighteen years old, Billie Eilish 
can play into your fears and masterfully 
manipulate them into a chart-topping 
hit. Despite the album’s chilling nature, 
its heavy bass riffs and exotic lyrical 
approach sucks you in; Eilish’s dark yet 
beautiful world of monsters and “bad guys” 
hypnotizes listeners. In a string of songs 
loaded with haunting vocals and heavy, 
reverberating bass, Eilish transports you to 
your worst nightmares while also feeding 
you with the satisfying electro beats you 
didn’t know you needed. While Eilish 
sticks to the spooky motif throughout the 
entire album, it contains brief moments of 
arbitrary elements — Eilish giggling, audio 
clips from “The Office,” and Eilish removing 
her Invisalign — slightly resembling the 
cluttered mind of a teenage girl. The most 
notable aspect of the album is the way 
Eilish boldly disassociates herself from the 
modern pop scene, giving a more mature 
and controlled style as compared to her 
teen-idol counterparts. Her distance from 
the status quo is the most defining element 
of the album and has certainly rewarded 
her in 2019. 
— Kaitlyn Fox, Daily Arts Writer

11. (Sandy) Alex G, House 
of Sugar
House of Sugar sets up the euphoric 
highs and dark pitfalls of a haunted gamble, 
except it places your 10-year-old self in front 
of the dealer. With a loose connection to the 
Philadelphia Casino “SugarHouse,” (Sandy) 
Alex G tackles indulgence and sweet facades 
with an eerie twist on what it means to be a 
kid in a candy shop. 
House of Sugar calls your bluff. The 
production distorts reality and then swings 
intermittently to moments of earnest 
acoustic chords that seem to snap us back 
to a discernible and disarming reality 
(perhaps when the candy is less addictive). 
The constancy of the acoustic chords offer 
a sober shoulder to lean upon, grounding 
his 
cosmic 
launches 
into 
electronic 
instrumentation. 
(Sandy) Alex G skews vocals and plays 
with repetition to expose youth throughout 
the record — tracks like “Taking” launch 
me back to a time when the most prominent 
lesson to learn was how to share. He’ll 
take a synth and turn the knob on it, with 
tracks like “Crime” and “Gretel,” like taking 
the pitch of a wolf’s howl and watching 
it deepen. You can physically feel the 
downward parabolic projection. The forest 
is haunted, the candy turns sour. Then 
we’re back to the sugar rush of his sweet 
upper register. 
House of Sugar seamlessly dips into 
southern folk, electronic,and psychedelic 
rock (to name a few), all while resting under 
this umbrella of assiduous DIY. It’s sincere 
and homey but takes immense, professional 
risks in a production that makes you feel 
like the entire animation team at Pixar 
could be behind this. But yet it’s still a DIY 
vibe. Baffling. 
— Samantha Cantie, Daily Music Editor

12. Lizzo, Cuz I Love You
Let’s make one thing clear from the get-
go: Cuz I Love You is a fantastic album. That’s 
it. Yes, we can talk — and will — about how 
Lizzo is exhilarating, powerful and bold, 
how she breaks barriers we didn’t realize we 
still had. But Lizzo isn’t on this list because 
she’s Black, or plus-size or explicit (I prefer 
free) with her words and actions. Lizzo is on 
our list because her album is good; Because 
her music is foot-stomping, hip-swinging, 
booty-shaking great. The bottom line is her 
music, and everything else that’s amazing 
about her can come after. I won’t cheapen 
Lizzo’s victory by suggesting Cuz I Love You 
is printed here for anything other than it’s 

own merits. 
Why is Cuz I Love You so good? The album 
is like a cannon blast: Lizzo’s powerful 
singing, the colorful, energizing lyrics, the 
diversity of sound in every track; because 
“Truth Hurts” is the anthem not just of 
the year, but of a coming generation. Lizzo, 
while undeniably a feminist powerhouse, 
speaks for the masses of the fed-up and 
taken for granted. Regardless of gender, 
age or race, Cuz I Love You speaks a little 
bit to everyone. Any album that can reach 
the hearts, minds, and souls of so many 
deserves 
profound 
acknowledgement. 
Because no one can hear Lizzo call out “I 
just took a DNA test, turns out I’m 100% 
that bitch” and not crow in joyful chorus. 
— Maddie Gannon, Daily Arts Writer

13. Solange, When I Get 
Home
In a conversation with Antwuan Sargent 
about her new project When I Get Home, 
Solange said “with this album I had so much 
to feel. Words would have been reductive to 
what I needed to feel and express. It’s in the 
sonics for me.” 
This 
impressionistic 
philosophy 
is 
executed to blissful effect on the project. 
Listening to When I Get Home feels as 
though you’ve been transported directly 
into Solange’s reveries. She’s aware of your 
presence, but pays it no mind. She’s not 
singing for you. The project is the sound 
of memories, curiosity and longing. The 
high concentration of dreamy interludes 
makes this album feel more like a singular, 
forty-minute experience than a collection 
of individual tracks. This is not to say that 
no songs stand out: “Stay Flo,” “Almeda” 
and “Binz” seem to break through the haze 
that hovers over most of the project, yet 
they are still rooted in the same sense of 
mellow curiosity as the rest of the album. 
And on top of it all, Playboi Carti’s feature 
on “Almeda” is life-changing. 
On When I Get Home, Solange sounds 
comfortable and confident, drifting over 
lush keys and sleepy grooves. While 
certainly less lyrically profound than A 
Seat at the Table, it is no less impactful or 
entrancing.
— Jonah Mendelson, Senior Arts Editor

14. Liturgy, H.A.Q.Q.
Liturgy’s last release, The Ark Work, was 
a step in the wrong direction with regard to 
the band’s mission to create “transcendent 
black metal.” It featured too much hip-
hop, too much glitchy weirdness and too 
much non-black metal music. It looked like 
the band was doomed to abandon their 
black metal roots and try something new, 
something that wasn’t black metal.
Not the case. Liturgy proves that The Ark 
Work was a misfire by reloading with the 
release of H.A.Q.Q. It took four years, but it 
was well worth the wait. H.A.Q.Q. presents 
a band one step closer to the realization of 
transcendent black metal. Sure, it doesn’t 
all work. The series of “EXACO” interludes 
aren’t quite necessary nor are they black 
metal, but songs like “PASAQALIA” and 
“GOD OF LOVE” more than make up for 
them. These songs breathe and adapt, 
almost like the music is alive. The glitchy 
elements are still present, but they augment 
the songs. It seems that with H.A.Q.Q., 
Liturgy has righted their course on the long 
road to the discovery of transcendence in 
black metal.
— Jim Wilson, Daily Arts Writer

15. 100 gecs, 1000 gecs
1000 gecs is a carnivorous approach 
to every music trend that’s spanned the 
last decade. None of this is new, none of 
this hasn’t been heard before, but the way 
everything comes together feels exciting 
and fresh. 100 gecs duo Laura Les and 
Dylan Brady take a maximalist approach to 
music that combines almost every trend of 
digital age and it feels right. Do not be fooled 
though; this almost abrasive mishmash 
never feels contrived or overwhelming. 
The grimy dubstep mix that thrashes at the 
end of “745 Sticky” is a departure from the 
song’s initial distorted, plinking synths but 
they transition into one another with ease. 
As is the case with the EDM emo blend 
that wraps incoherent “hand crushed by a 
mallet,” the perfect bridge between Brady 
and Les’ distinct production styles. Maybe 
it’s the creaky, pitched vocals that stand 
out amid the chaos or the sparse, almost 
incoherent lyricism that keep this project 
from feeling like an incomprehensible 
catastrophe — in theory, this project 
shouldn’t have worked. Whatever the case 
may be, Les and Brady brilliantly, dare I 
say meticulously, curate an energetic mix 
of short tracks that deftly display different 
forms of music all at once.

Thursday, January 16, 2020 — 3B

Every year, we search curiously for movies we love. Often, we miss. I find that I am insufferably dour 
when it comes to deciding if a given year is a good year for movies up until the very last month, when 
the Oscar-eligible films come rushing in like the downpour after a drought. This year, we found movies 
we adored, and we honored some of them here. And when “Joker” wins best picture in February I will 
only hold this list closer.

1. Little Women
The first time Timothée Chalamet’s (“Beautiful Boy”) Laurie steps inside the March sisters’ 
household, he just stares. The titular little women are melting into the choreography of sisterly 
dynamics, all undergirded by undeniable love, and he watches. Yes, he’s a man, yes, he’s gazing — 
both key components of the male gaze — but that’s not what presents itself. His look does not belittle 
them, or their individuality, or their collectivity; it gathers all of that up somehow and returns it to 
us, glowing with admiration.
Greta Gerwig’s (“Lady Bird”) adaptation of “Little Women” does not stand out because it is radical. 
It’s occasionally revisionist — suggesting Jo’s marriage was not the original ending of her story — 
but that’s not it, either. It is special because of moments like this, for its habit of asking us to look 
with indiscriminate kindness upon people who are struggling to love each other, and themselves.
And it’s asking us to look up to them, too. Not just to the subversive woman. Gerwig gives us 
reason to look up to the woman who chooses not to marry as well as the one who does. The woman 
who wants to leave, and the one who chooses to stay. The woman who stands up for herself, and the 
one who stands down when her sister asks her to. To anyone who’s looking for their place in the 
world, at the same time that they’re fighting for it, at the same time that they’re just trying to get 
through another day in it. That may not be everything, but it is outstanding.
— Julianna Morano, Managing Arts Editor

2. Parasite
“Parasite” is so powerful that its cinematic excellence is almost taken for granted — one is too 
focused on the crushing plot to notice the airtight vessel it comes in. 
In “Parasite’s” immersive narrative, the Kims, an impoverished family, con their way into working 
for the Parks, an affluent one. But isn’t just a masterwork of suspense and thrills; it’s scathing social 
commentary. Throughout the film, the grimy sub-basement where the Kims live is contrasted with 
the Parks’ Edenic mansion. Without a single word, Ho conveys a more brutal and heart wrenching 
message than the best documentaries or political ads could ever hope for.
In the context of the first few days of 2020, the film is terrifyingly relevant. In “Parasite,” the rich 
complain as their servants stink from the rising, pollutant filled water that has filled their homes. 
No wonder blood is spilled. 
“Parasite” is a finely crafted, Swiss watch of a movie that becomes a social hand grenade at the end 
of its flawless runtime. As the credits roll, viewers have something to both wonder at and endlessly 
contemplate when the lights come back on. What else could one want? 
— Andrew Warrick, Daily Arts Writer

3. Knives Out
Rian Johnson’s (“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”) “Knives Out” was one of my 2019 movie highlights. 
Though it didn’t necessarily go the way I was expecting it to go based on promotional language and 
trailers, as I expressed in my review of the film, I genuinely enjoyed watching it.
Despite the primary cast member being Daniel Craig (“Casino Royale”) in his role as Benoit Blanc, 
the stars of the show for me were Ana de Armas’ (“Blade Runner 2049”) Marta Cabrera and Chris 
Evans’ (“The Avengers”) Ransom Drysdale. De Armas’ portrayal of an innocent and shockingly real 
character among a family of snobs was heartwarming and Evans’ dedication to a character so unlike 
Steve Rogers was steadfast, though I’ll admit it was incredibly strange to see him play a jerk after 
watching him play the golden boy, Captain America, for so many years.
The movie doesn’t play out as the ‘whodunnit’ it was promoted as, at least not by my standards, 
but even though I was initially slightly annoyed by that, after some time, I was able to appreciate 
the movie for what it was: not necessarily an Agatha Christie-esque enclosed murder mystery and 
‘whodunnit,’ but a story of an unconventional and yet very real, family. Though many of the family 
members were exaggerated caricatures and obviously overplayed to dramatize their relationships 
and circumstances, they were almost unnaturally relatable as well — even the cruel ones (perhaps, 
especially the cruel ones). 
— Sabriya Imami, Daily Arts Writer

4. Booksmart
Actress Olivia Wilde’s (“Richard Jewell) directorial debut is warm and funny, filled with 
kinetic camerawork and dynamic performances. Beanie Feldstein (“Lady Bird”) and Kaitlyn Dever 
(“Beautiful Boy”) team up to play Molly and Amy, smart and uptight high school seniors who want 
to have some fun on their last night before graduation. This pair is the heart and soul of the movie, 
carrying an infectious energy and love for the other, as well as the kind of lore that can only be built 
on the back of a decade-long friendship. 
However, they are in no way dominant over the movie, and the mini universe the film builds up 
around them feels just as real and interesting as the protagonists. To watch “Booksmart” is to enter 
a tight and carefully constructed world, with every ancillary character having a defined personality 
and a purpose, and every joke well-timed and executed. The teenagers feel real, not like studio-
mandated projections, and every space they occupy, from high school to the rich kid’s house to the 
local pizza parlor, feels lush and well lived-in. “Booksmart” is the very best of what teen movies can 
do — full of laughs and horribly awkward moments, but also full of love and honesty. It’s hilarious, 
sweet and tender. There’s no doubt that it will come to join the pantheon of the great high school 
movies.
— Asif Becher, Daily Arts Writer

5. Jojo Rabbit
Taika Waititi’s “Jojo Rabbit” made me cry. And not just in the theoretical, texting exaggeration 
sense, but in the very real, sniffling in the theater sense. The film takes the Nazi regime and thinly 
layers it with moments of comedic relief. The overall effect is an unsettlingly funny exploration of 
the blind faith of youth. 
Aside from its heart wrenching plot and adorable cast, Waititi’s newest film came at an opportune 
time in American politics. As we enter a new election year, “Jojo Rabbit” highlights the teachable 
nature of bigotry and racism and gives hope that even those who seem intensely rooted in their 
belief system can find a way to change. 
— Emma Chang, Daily Arts Writer

6. The Farewell
“The Farewell,” based on its premise alone, may just be the saddest film of 2019. The film, 
which follows a young Chinese American woman (Awkwafina, “Crazy Rich Asians”) who is asked 
by her family to keep her grandmother in the dark about her terminal illness in accordance with 
traditional Chinese customs, asks painful, emotionally resonant questions about what it means to 
die and, conversely, what it means to live. Though “The Farewell” is very much centered around 
non-Western, specifically Chinese perceptions of death, it also reminds us of something universally 
true: everyone is afraid to die. 
Clearly, “The Farewell” is a bit of a downer. But it’s also not a downer at all. In demystifying death, 
in capturing it with honesty and a complete lack of romanticization, the film reminds us of just how 
special it is to be alive, and in doing so encourages us to be present, to live as though every day might 
be our last. 
— Elise Godfryd, Senior Arts Editor

7. Midsommar
There’s this moment in “Midsommar” that stuck with me more than any other. It got memed to hell, 
so that hasn’t helped me forget the scar of watching it for the first time either. After Florence Pugh’s 
(“Outlaw King”) Dani discovers her boyfriend (Jack Reynor, “What Richard Did”) participating in a 
Pagan sex ritual, she returns to her cabin and promptly collapses onto the floor. So her companions 
from the May Queen celebration gather around her and begin to imitate her agonized wails, in a 
blood-curlingly hideous chant. Their voices only grow, their breathing in sync; her pain is their 
pain. Their sobs become cries and their cries become shrieks, ripping violently into a viewer’s ears. 
It’s cathartic and spine-chilling. “Midsommar” is a movie that horrifies a viewer by literally passing 
the limits of what they thought could be horrifying. It is anxiety incarnate. 
On top of the fertility rites and the carnage and the claustrophobic tone of it all, “Midsommar” 
is also hilarious. From one perspective, it’s about the worst-case scenario of competing PhD theses 
gone wrong. Watching Dani’s American companions grapple with the sheer weirdness of the 
commune is endlessly entertaining. Oh, not to mention Will Poulter (“War Machine”) juuls and 
broods the entire time. 
— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

8. Marriage Story
Noah Baumbach has always been an artist interested in separation. His breakout 2004 film “The 
Squid and the Whale” tells the semi-autobiographical story of two New York City writers’ caustic 
divorce, their two children hanging in the balance. Films like “Frances Ha” and “The Meyerowitz 
Stories” deal with the severance of friendships and with serialized isolations. The ways people fall 
out of relationships and the lasting effects that linger seem to always be at the front of the writer/
director’s mind when he’s developing his films. “Marriage Story” is no different.
There’s a tremendous amount of potential energy stored up in a relationship that has passed the 
point of no return. Two people, once in love — maybe still so — hold the details of the other’s most 
piercing insecurities and defeats up their sleeves. As Scarlett Johansson’s character Nicole says 
early in the film, “It’s not just about not being in love anymore.” “Marriage Story” explores what 
two people are pushed to do and feel and say when life as they know it begins to come apart. The 
film earns its accolades in its last fifteen minutes with two scenes that show what’s really lost in a 
divorce, two peoples’ reasons for being alive.
— Stephen Satarino, Daily Arts Writer

9. The Lighthouse
There’s something otherworldly about Robert Eggers’ second feature. It’s probably the mermaid.
The film works hard to embed its characters in the dramatic circumstances of their prolonged 
stay out tending the light. When their transport doesn’t arrive on time, time itself begins to bend 
and break. We’ve got no more clue than they do about how long they’ve been stuck out on the rock.
It’s always a joy to see an artist thrill themselves with the prospects of allegory. To anyone 
intimately familiar with the Greek myths of Proteus and Prometheus, the characters Willem Defoe 
and Robert Pattinson respectively play come as refreshing iterations on two age old tales. The risk of 
such heavy allegory is that it will take the viewer out of their experience. When watching something 
like Darren Aronofsky’s “Mother!,” it’s hard not to nudge the person beside you in the theater and 
point at Cain and Abel and the fall. “The Lighthouse” manages its allegory brilliantly, distancing 
itself enough to feel fresh while still managing to soak up some of the gravitas of the source material.
— Stephen Satarino, Daily Arts Writer

10. Uncut Gems 
To call this film a rollercoaster would be to describe a ride that doesn’t exist. “Uncut Gems” is 
unlike most other movies you’ll watch in that it doesn’t pause for a moment to give you your bearings, 
allow you to unpack what is happening or even explain to you what in the world is going on. The 
movie moves like a firecracker, throwing Adam Sandler (“Punch-Drunk Love”) into all kinds of 
just-crazy-enough-to-seem-real situations and demanding that the audience stay out of the way. 
Sandler is an actor unhinged in this sometimes frightening, sometimes funny, always surprising 
film that doesn’t let you ask any questions, because you simply don’t have the time.

Everyone had distinct experiences in 2019, and The Michigan Daily Book Review has put together 
the best works it experienced throughout the year. Accounting for the differences in everyone’s 2019 
experiences, these works range from novels to poetry collections to graphic novels and come from 
authors originating from Ohio to Ukraine. Enjoy.
— Andrew Pluta, Daily Book Review Editor

“Deaf Republic” by Ilya Kaminsky
The deaf republic in Ilya Kaminsky’s poetry collection of the same name is not collectively hard-
of-hearing; its citizens are deaf by choice. They are living in a fictional, seemingly Soviet-era town 
under harsh military rule. In protest of a sergeant’s shooting of a young boy, they refuse to hear the 
soldiers’ commands, existing in silence instead. Kaminsky, who lost most of his hearing at age four, 
not only shatters our conception of deafness, but our hearts, too, at the heights cruelty and sacrifice 
reach under oppressive regimes. He also shatters our illusions of what civic responsibility and 
political protest mean, and all — most notably — without making speeches, or filling the emptiness 
with sheer noise.
He does so more inventively than any writer in recent memory. “Deaf Republic” could be described 
as a play in verse, straddling the genres with elegance. On various pages, illustrations of hands 
signing a word in the townspeople’s improvised sign language accompany the text, taking up the 
same protest as the citizens of the story. In one of the most unexpected elements from the collection 
(which, as you can see, is saying a lot), Kaminsky makes brilliant use of puppets, as the townspeople 
put on shows to satirize the absurdity of their oppressed lives.
“At the trial of God, we will ask: why did you allow all this? / And the answer will be an echo: why 
did you allow all this?” Kaminsky writes, in one of his most resonant lines. You can hear a similar 
echo at the conclusion of Kaminsky’s work, when he shifts into the present-day United States where 
he now lives, and indicts our passivity toward the police killings taking place on our own soil, day 
in, day out. It’s literature that doesn’t exempt you from its implications — the best, most urgent kind.
— Julianna Morano, Managing Arts Editor

“Ohio” by Stephen Markely
The continental Midwest is a landscape so bleak and sore that it’s usually difficult to write about 
— in most fiction it’s a place to escape from, or else it’s just plain depressing (think Eugenides, 
Franzen). In “Ohio,” Stephen Markley understands that this is the Midwest, with all of its blandness 
and forgotten-America rust. He doesn’t shy away from it. He doesn’t gloss over the dirty parts. 
Rather, he centers his entire novel on the dim Midwest — in this case, New Canaan, Ohio — and lets 
it live for itself. Ohio isn’t such a setting or a title. It’s the very lifeline of Markley’s freshman novel, 
sewn deep into the gut of every character and propelling every action taken.
“Ohio” is most striking for its capacity to capture agrestic, patriotic small-town America not in 
a single frame, but in an evolving, cinema-like fashion. The story feels encompassing, spanning 
decades of social change and decline while feeling dangerously fresh. Markely writes both accurately 
and unabashedly about the crisis of identity and social immobility facing places like New Canaan, 
though not in a manner that feels moralizing. The books themes are never overwrought. Instead, 
“Ohio” is merely a depiction: a raw, thrilling exposition of what much of America looks like, thinks 
and talks about; and at times, it is a tale that sickens more than it remedies.

“Normal People” by Sally Rooney 
“Normal People” proves Sally Rooney is not a one-hit-wonder with “Conversations With Friends.” 
Rooney extends the psychological undertone of “Conversation With Friends” until it reaches that 
precarious line of discomfort in “Normal People.” On the surface, “Normal People” tells a simple 
romance between two people with diverging socio-economic classes. Marianne is an intensely 
private girl, unpopular among her classmates but from an affluent background. Conner is the 
complete opposite — popular and handsome but struggling to get by. Somewhat embarrassed by 
Marianne, Conner conceals their romance from their classmates. Conner’s selfish decision as a high-
schooler sparks the deeply complex relationship with Marianne that prevails until the very end of 
the novel. “Normal People” is the perfect romance novel for people that hate romance. “Normal 
People’s” introduction seems familiar enough: boy meets girl, boy and girl have a conflict. But 
Rooney quickly subverts the traditional plotline with her emphasis on the various obstacles outside 
Conner and Marianne’s bubble, making it impossible to foresee the customary “happily-ever-after” 

ending. Rooney’s subtle Marxist and feminist critique and ability to capture the imperfections of 
the human psyche allow “Normal People” to break the boundaries of “romance” and fill the space 
of brilliance. While it’s hard to idealize Marianne and Conner, their aptly human flaws make it easy 
to fall in love with them. Nearly a year later, I find my thoughts veering to “Normal People” and the 
ways that I, too, am a flawed human.

“Fix Her Up (Hot & Hammered)” by Tessa Bailey 
Delightfully steamy and funny, Tessa Bailey’s “Fix Her Up” is the perfect novel to read if you 
need a palette cleanser. “Fix Her Up” follows two characters, Georgette Castle and Travis Ford. 
Georgette Castle has harbored a deeply intense crush on Travis Ford since, well, forever. Travis 
Ford, meanwhile, has always viewed her as his best friend’s little sister: someone to look after, but 
not someone to develop feelings for per se. While Georgette has been rooted in her small-town 
of Port Jefferson with her career as a clown, Travis Ford has been revered all over the nation as 
major league baseball’s hottest rookie. That is, until, Travis gets injured. As their paths collide, 
Georgette gradually realizes that she must take control of her future, whether it be by standing up 
to her dismissive family or by wooing Travis. Travis also recognizes that his self-worth is not merely 
his prematurely halted baseball career and that the people who were truly most important to him 
might’ve been under his nose all along. Bailey’s “Fix Her Up” includes plenty of romantic staples, 
including a heady scene with the “other woman” and the “innocent” heroine with the prolific playboy, 
but those tropes are handled with care. Bailey thoughtfully resolves angsty misunderstandings with 
communication and even subverts the common idealization of the “playboy” hero by addressing 
society’s constraining concept of masculinity. “Fix Her Up” has the ability to yoke a myriad of 
emotions, tears, laughter and those elusive twinges of “it-hurts-so-good!” It’s not just a chick-lit, 
but a funny, romantic and deeply touching novel about discovering your full-potential, independent 
from anyone else.
—Sarah Salman, Daily Arts Writer

 “The Crying Book” by Heather Cristle
I love crying. It’s one of my top three favorite physical activities. So when the Goodreads algorithm 
suggested this book to me, I grew a little nervous about exactly how closely the FBI agent living 
inside of my computer has been paying attention lately. But regardless of how this book fell into my 
hands, it quickly became one of my all-time favorites. 
Heather Cristle is a poet who is also a self-proclaimed crying enthusiast. In “The Crying Book,” 
she explores tears and the role they fill in gender, history, race and art. Part memoir, part historical 
and cultural analysis, this novel touches on subjects that are personal to Cristle — suicide, pregnancy, 
depression — and also universal. The way she unfurls her prose is slow, interweaving and, much like 
the act of crying, left me feeling vulnerable and gutted in the best way. The ideas she explores in 
her novel are presented in such palpable and beautiful terms that I can remember where I was and 
what I was doing when I was reading any part of the novel. I read about how Cristle delved into the 
world of Amazon reviews for crying plastic dolls while eating a solitary dinner in the Whole Foods 
food court. I bookmarked a passage describing the way tears look in the absence of gravity as I 
absentmindedly stroked my cat’s head, right on the bald spot between his eyes. 
If you have ever cried at least once in the span of your entire life, this book is also for you. 
—Jo Chang, Senior Arts Editor

“Sabrina” by Nick Drnaso
There is something unsettling about the artwork in Nick Drnaso’s graphic novel “Sabrina,” which 
follows the aftermath of the disappearance and anonymous murder of the titular young woman. It 
strays from the use of bright colors and details, opting for simple geometric figures and a muted color 
palette that is reminiscent of a coloring book for a child with a limited range of drawing utensils. 
Characters mill around with facial expressions devoid of much personalization and feeling — even 
during the most morbid scenes, the characters’ simple facial expressions reveal nothing about the 
terror behind them. For a novel that explores brutal violence, misogyny and isolation, this over-
simplicity and lack of visible human emotions creates an atmosphere that is deeply unsettling. The 
effect is something similar to being the object of the steady gaze of a wild animal or, say, a small 
child, and not knowing exactly when they plan on springing upon you with unrepressed fury — but 
living in constant dread knowing that something horrible is coming, wondering not if but when. 
“Sabrina” will leave you feeling uncomfortable and disturbed, but also in awe of the way Nick 
Drnaso is able to capture the essence of loss and pose a commentary 
on human interactions in the modern world so subtly and succinctly.
—Jo Chang, Books Senior Arts Editor

This 2019 awards race might have one of the most crowded 
acting fields in recent years. Last year delivered so many impressive 
performances that many of them were either snubbed from 
nominations or will lose to someone we find unfavorable. So here, we 
did our best to highlight the best performances of 2019. (They’re all 
more compelling than Joaquin Phoenix in “Joker,” so feel free to turn 
off the TV when he accepts his Oscar.)

Best Actresses

1. Florence Pugh: “Little Women”
In Gillian Armstrong’s adaptation of “Little Women” — which 
was my introduction to Louisa May Alcott’s story — Amy March 
was so easy to hate. And I did hate her; I longed for Jo’s fierceness 
and independence, and I denounced Amy for her jealousy and 
sabotage. I could only ever see her as the anti-Jo, never as a woman 
of her own.
That is, until Florence Pugh stepped into Amy’s shoes. Her 
shoes from adolescence into early adulthood, I will add. Unlike 
previous depictions, Pugh plays Amy in both flashbacks and the 
present, and at any age steals the show. I smiled every time Pugh’s 
Amy snuck in a clever dig at Jo. I didn’t resent her for her stance 
on marriage, or for stealing Laurie. I recognized some of my 
younger brother’s pain in hers. Not only that, but after all these 
years I could even see myself in her: I cried when I saw the look of 
impossible relief on Amy’s face, as she asked for forgiveness from 
Jo without expecting to receive it. It’s a look I’ve worn myself, 
many times.
That self-recognition would’ve been inconceivable to a younger 
me. But the explanation is simple: Pugh finally showed me that 
Amy is a full person, rather than my hero’s foil. Isn’t that what all 
great performers force us to confront? It’s dangerous to reproduce 
troubling sibling dynamics on screen; it’s a feat to undo it, and to 
get a more complicated hero out of it. On that note, Pugh is the 
real hero of this adaptation, and we’re the better for it: Our heroes 
should be hard to love.
— Julianna Morano, Managing Arts Editor

2. Lupita Nyong’o: “Us”
Okay, so this is a little bit of a cheat because Lupita probably 
deserves two spots on this list. One of them is for her performance 
as Adelaide, a loving mother with haunting memories in “Us.” The 
other is for her performance as “Red,” a murderous doppleganger 
with a robotic instinct for violence and a memorably raspy throat 

in “Us.” Indeed, it is impossible to articulate the level of acting 
talent required to pull off roles as hero and villain in a movie 
simultaneously, but Nyong’o carries the whole movie on her back. 
Her stark duality is a feat in and of itself, but she also lends 
credibility to the film’s mystifying twist ending. We thought we 
understood Adelaide. But maybe, we no longer do. And the image 
of her snapping to the offbeats of Lunis’s “I Got 5 On It” comes 
back to haunt you.
— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

3. Ana de Armas: “Knives Out”
In a movie full of familiar faces, Ana de Armas (“Blade Runner 
2049”) is one of the least recognizable, dwarfed in the marketing 
campaign by big names like Daniel Craig (“Spectre”), Jamie Lee 
Curtis (“True Lies”), Christopher Plummer (“Beginners”) and 
Chris Evans (“Avengers: Endgame”). Yet from the moment she 
appears on screen, De Armas seizes the audience’s attention 
and claims her position as the movie’s main character. Her role 
as Marta Cabrera, the nurse of the recently deceased Harlan 
Thrombey (Plummer) and a genuinely kind soul, is a breath of 
normalcy in comparison with the ignorant and greedy Thrombey 
family. De Armas’ performance is incredibly compelling, uniting 
the film around a character who appears to be one of the few 
people the audience can trust and whose emotions are palpable 
and relatable. In a movie filled with crazy characters, being the 
“normal” person is not easy, yet it is a role that De Armas takes on 
with grace and skill.
—Kari Anderson, For the Daily

4. Honor Swinton Byrne: “The Souvenir”
Honor Swinton Byrne’s performance as Julie in “The Souvenir” 
is not immediately notable. She is a vehicle for Hogg’s own 
experience with a shady older man during her time in film 
school. Nearly everything about her is normal — seemingly too 
ordinary to be a character in a movie. But it’s precisely this sense 
of harmless normalcy that gives the film’s building conflict its 
searing edge. When Julie becomes involved with Anthony (Tom 
Burke, “Only God Forgives”), all appears well. But it is only when 
the audience grasps the magnitude of her gravitation toward 
him despite his money problems, drug problems and alarmingly 
callous disposition that we realize how hard it is for her to pull 
away. And we are pulled in, too. 
— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

Best Actors

1. Roman Griffin Davis: “Jojo Rabbit”
Roman Griffin Davis’ performance in last year’s “Jojo Rabbit” is 
remarkable and not just by child actor standards. In this role, that 
of a 10-year-old Nazi youth struggling to decide what he actually 
believes in, Davis is asked to emote what feels at times like the 
entire human experience. Not only is he expected to provide much 
of the film’s humor, his character undergoes several of life’s most 
momentous emotional experiences — first love, first loss, first 
realization that maybe the people you’ve looked up to for so long 
aren’t so great after all. In short, Davis is responsible for carrying 
the film, and he doesn’t just pull it off. He knocks it out of the 

park, setting an entirely new standard for what child actors are 
artistically capable of accomplishing. 
— Elise Godfryd, Senior Arts Editor

2. Brad Pitt: “One Upon a Time in Hollywood”
“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” is a whirlwind of a film, held 
together by loose duck tape and one of Brad Pitt’s (“Ad Astra”) best 
performances in years. In the role of aging stuntman Cliff Booth, 
Pitt’s laid back charm and easy swagger come together to perfectly 
embody a man going through the motions but seemingly content to 
do so. Whole sequences rely entirely on the audience’s capacity to 
like Brad Pitt, despite the hints at Cliff’s potentially violent past. 
In the hands of an actor of Pitt’s caliber, it never seems to entirely 
matter that Cliff Booth may be a murderous maniac. Maybe that’s 
the point, or maybe Pitt can put on just that good of a show.
— Ian Harris, Daily Arts Writer

3. Adam Driver: “Marriage Story”
The most intense scene in “Marriage Story,” and arguably the 
most intense scene of Adam Driver’s (“Star Wars: The Rise of 
Skywalker”) career, has been meme-ified by the Internet. Many of 
these memes revolve around the premise of Driver and Johansson’s 
(“Jojo Rabbit”) big fight resembling the fights people have heard 
countless times from their neighbors, their extended family, even 
their own parents. Others simply mock the sheer drama of the 
scene and the ferocity of Driver’s performance.
For the first, doesn’t this speak to the authenticity of Driver’s 
performance, that he was able to so accurately replicate the 
realities of marital strife? For the second, isn’t Driver’s burst of 
anger justified within the context of the movie? His character 
before this key moment is emotionally restrained in nearly 
everything, a pushover in the face of his wife’s demands. The entire 
movie builds up to this moment when he finally loses it. And his 
outburst is a completely natural reaction to months and months 
of emotional and psychological torment. Though it is certainly 
dramatic, it’s also very human, and Driver makes it work.

From Eilish to Lil Nas X:
 the ten best songs of 2019

DAILY MUSIC WRITERS
Daily Arts Writers

If there’s one thing we can be sure of in a year of 
uncertainty, it’s good television. The day-to-day 
chaos that overwhelmed our lives made 2019 feel 
slow and exhausting, yet it somehow managed 
to fly right by. As some of our favorite television 
shows retire with the decade, we open the door to 
new possibilities and spaces for original content. 
I can only imagine how much more challenging 
it’ll be in the future to make a list like this 
considering the new limbo we’ve entered between 
cable television and streaming services, but it fills 
me with hope to see how far television has come 
in the past decade. This year, we saw talk shows 
get political, witnessed John Mulaney make 
a children’s comedy special and realized that 
looking directly at the camera isn’t only for Jim 
Halpert. I have high hopes for what the television 
gods will cook up for us in the coming years. In 
making this list, the TV beat admittedly struggled 
for a bit to look past the horrendous television we 
consumed for the purposes of journalism, but 
we finally narrowed it down to ten of the most 
groundbreaking, entertaining and compelling TV 
shows of the year. So without further ado, here 
are the best television shows we watched in 2019 
(in no particular order).
— Sophia Yoon, Daily TV Editor

“You” 
A wise prophet once said, “you know you’re 
that bitch when you cause all this conversation.” 
It doesn’t take an English degree to catch that 
Mrs. Knowles is making a daring, yet direct 
reference to the man at the center of the cultural 
phenomenon “You” — the plaid shirt-clad serial 
killer himself, Joe Goldberg. 
Day-one fans will be quick to point out 
that “You” was originally released in 2018 on 
Lifetime, the edgy, hip network where women 
just on the cusp of menopause really let their 
hair down, but I will contend that because the 
Netflix masses did not get their hands on “You” 
until early 2019, that 2019 should be considered 
its cohort year instead. 
It is no secret that “You,” obnoxiously 
pretentious in all the right ways, lacks 
plausibility in almost every storyline, as well 
as dimension for its female characters. But 
what “You” lacks in substance it makes up in 
character names so ridiculous that “Riverdale” 
seems tame in comparison: There’s Guinevere 
Beck, Peach, Forty, someone operating under 
the alias Amy Adam and who could forget the 
central love interest, aptly dubbed Love. 
“You” is an interesting television show — not 
just because of Penn Badgley’s chest hair making 
consistent appearances — but rather because 
it exemplifies the rarity of a piece earning 
the status of cult classic in real time. While 
normally it takes 10 to 15 years for someone to 
build the courage to make a revisionist reading 
of a critically panned piece, it took viewers 
under a year to determine that yes, “You” is 
bananas, but that isn’t going to get in the way 
of us figuring out just how Joe cleaned up the 
blood the Roomba smeared. 
— Ally Owens, TV Senior Arts Editor

 “Shrill” 
Hulu’s comedy series “Shrill,” based on the 
novel of the same name and starring SNL cast 
member Aidy Bryant, reflects the social moment 
of 2019 in all of its tragedy and absurdity. Main 
character Annie struggles with her status as a 
plus-sized woman in a culture that expects her 
to stay timid and ashamed. Unable to assert 
herself at work or in her relationships, Annie 
feels utterly powerless in her life. In the first 
episode of the season, however, the balance of 
power is shifted when she makes the choice to 
get an abortion and place her own needs before 
others for the first time in her life. This initial 
action pushes Annie to take control of her life 
and believe in her own talents and abilities. 
Throughout the season, she learns what it 
means to stand up for herself and take up space 
in all the places she’s been shut out of.
The show’s depiction of her journey to 
embrace self-love and confidence mirrors the 
current push towards body positivity that is 
popular on social media. Much of the series 
is devoted to depicting demographics often 
shamed by popular culture and presenting 
diversity in a more realistic way. In portraying 
characters of different body types, races, 
sexualities and lifestyles as equally human and 
equally flawed, the weight of stigma is lifted and 
the opportunities for lightness and humor are 
allowed in. With the talent of star Aidy Bryant 
and a solid and inspiring storyline, “Shrill” sets 
itself apart from TV’s less nuanced comedies.
— Anya Soller, Daily Arts Writer

“Dead to Me” 
Grief and loss. Only Christina Applegate (“Up 
All Night”) and Linda Cardellini (“Green Book”) 
could make a comedy out of that. “Dead to Me” 
is the definition of a tragicomedy. Applegate 
plays Jen, a mother of two whose husband was 
recently killed in a hit-and-run. Cardellini plays 
Judy, who also has recently experienced a close 
loss. After meeting in grief counseling, the dark 
place that Jen is in, coupled with the positivity 
of Judy, leads to an unexpected friendship. Judy 
then moves into Jen’s guest house. However, 
Judy lives with the guilt of knowing she was 
involved in the death of Jen’s husband. Over 
the course of the season, the audience learns 
along with the characters themselves how 
imperfect the lives of both Jen and Judy are 
and why their friendship is perfect for one 
another. Jen scavenges the neighborhood, 
looking for cars with human-sized dents as 
she pressures the police into finding the killer 
of her husband, unbeknownst that she is living 
with them. The mystery that surrounds the 
first season is whether or not Judy is crazy for 
living with Jen and the family of the man she 
accidentally killed. The secondary mystery is 
how a character as loveable as Judy could run 
from the crime scene. All these questions are 
answered by the finale, but not before more are 
presented.
— Justin Pollack, Daily Arts Writer

“Watchmen”
How do masked police officers, squids that 
rain from the sky and the KKK fit together in one 
coherent show and make sense? “Watchmen” is 
the answer — a show crafted from a confusing, 
destabilizing series of puzzles, each more 
complex than the last. The series’s first episode, 
which featured the forgotten Tulsa Race Riot, 
blew apart expectations. Each episode after 
was a gut punch. As a masked detective of the 
Tulsa Police, Angela Abar — or Sister Night — 
weaves her way through secrets and lies toward 
discoveries about both herself and the world, 
making the truth seem more ridiculous than 
what she originally thought. Under the watchful 
eye of FBI Agent Laurie Blake, Abar gets real 
with evil geniuses, white supremacists and 
literal gods. “Watchmen” was bold, breathless 
and brilliant. With knockout performances 
from Regina King (“If Beale Street Could 
Talk”), Tim Blake Nelson (“The Ballad of Buster 
Scruggs”), Jeremy Irons (“The Borgias”) and 
Hong Chau (“Downsizing”), “Watchmen” was 
both intense and wacky. Not a minute of the 
show’s nine episodes was wasted. Each offering 
was a narrative suckerpunch that disturbed 
and enthralled as HBO made bold visual and 
narrative choices that left viewers consistently 
uncertain about where the show was heading. 
In the end, what was produced was one of the 
best television shows not just of 2019, but of the 
decade.
— Maxwell Schwarz, Daily Arts Writer

“Undone” 
A show’s first season, more often than not, 
is an attempt to find target audiences and to 
find footing in a chaotic world of different 
television genres. But the shows that enter 
the arena without shame or hesitation either 
revolutionize audience perceptions of TV and 
genre or run the risk of completely bombing. 
“Undone” passes easily as the former and finds 
footing in being undefined. 
After a severe car accident and a visit from her 
dead dad, Alma discovers she can manipulate 
time. Throughout the season, she works with 
her dad to learn how to use her newfound power 
to her advantage and figure out who murdered 
her father. The show uses rotoscope animation 
so that the characters can take shape in the 
form of their respective actors, making the 
transition between fantasy and reality nearly 
undetectable. 
Despite the fantasy aspects of the show, its plot 
remains grounded and realistic, particularly in 
the way it handles the effects of trauma and 
interpersonal relationships. What initially drew 
me in was the unique art style, which certainly 
held its own against the complex layers of the 
plot and three-dimensional characters. But I 
gradually realized throughout the season that 
the animation style wasn’t the most unique part 
of the season. “Undone” is a show that fluctuates 
in between genre and style, and while I’m often 
nervous that the quality of good television 
decreases after its renewal, I maintain full faith 
that the series will hold its own in a future “best 
of” list.

WARNER BROS. TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION

1. Tyler The Creator, “EARFQUAKE”
For real this time.
Imagine being told four years ago that Tyler, 
the Creator would release the best track of 2019 
and that it would be a bittersweet soul song 
featuring Playboi Carti. It’s remarkable how 
much Tyler has grown in the last few years, and 
“EARFQUAKE” is a powerful exhibition of his 
newfound songwriting strength.
“EARFQUAKE” is the thesis statement of 
Tyler’s latest album IGOR. It establishes a few 
key themes right out of the gate: an insecurity as 
to whether his partner reciprocates his feelings, 
a fear of abandonment and intense internal 
turmoil that can’t be entirely expressed. Most 
remarkable is how he manages to communicate 
these essential and resonant themes through 
such few words, a testament to the power of 
brevity. “Don’t leave / it’s my fault”: A desperate 
plea, almost choked out, simple and earnest, this 
expression of weakness is paradoxically linked to 
the pounding drums that accompany its delivery. 
Harmonically speaking, the song is composed 
entirely of major and minor seventh chords, ones 
which do not clearly resolve in any direction, 
creating a sort of rootless feeling. The rhetorical 
effect of this compositional choice is a sense of 
liminality and impending change. The desperate 
frustration of the lyrics combined with the 
unclear harmonic backdrop creates dramatic 
tension: How will his partner respond to his 
plea? 
“EARFQUAKE” 
is 
a 
deft 
piece 
of 
craftsmanship, particularly in its ability to 
evoke and intensify the tension of the situation 
Tyler finds himself in through the symbiotic 
relationship between harmony and lyrics. It’s 
catchy, emotionally saturated and profoundly 
human. It’s lightning in a bottle. 
 — Jonah Mendelson, Senior Arts Editor

2. Charli XCX and Christine and the 
Queens, “Gone”
“Gone” is muscular. Its fireworks of grandeur, 
pop-futurism and expert execution make it 
a driving, catchy force that reflects Charli 
XCX’s gradual ascent into her truest form. 
“Gone” glows neon in my mind; it’s the song I 
consistently place on repeat to start my morning 
routine. It’s this fierceness of pushing forward 
and a reflection of the generational lifestyle 
both her and her audience are experiencing, as 
she states in her NOWNESS interview: “I’m not 
super sentimental about much of my stuff. I just 
like to kind of go, and as long as I have friends 
with me — that’s my main thing.” There’s an 
unmatched authenticity that Charli brings to 
the future of pop — she completely backs up her 
persona with her actions, during a time when 
following through with the image you create is 
more important than ever. 
“Gone” is a wonderful contradiction in its 
reflection of both the hustle and strength of being 
on the move (surrounded by friends, partying, 
going going gone) while still questioning why 
we’re always so quick to move along. Charli XCX 
writes anthems for the uncontrollable emotions 
of this generation. She’s speeding 100 miles 
per hour down a highway of confidence, sex, 
and body positivity. “Gone” is the apex of that 
mentality. 
 — Samantha Cantie, Daily Music Editor

3. Lil Nas X, “Old Town Road” 
You couldn’t go through 2019 without hearing 
“Old Town Road.” Gen Z’s #YeehawChallenge 
was every boomer’s go-to barbecuing anthem. 
And Lil Nas X produced it with 30 bucks and a 
steady online personality. The song transcends 
our expectations for genres and popular music: a 
confident, effortless and blithe blend of trap and 
country that samples Nine Inch Nails. Lyrically 
about riding a horse, the track became Lil Nas 
X’s breakthrough rags-to-riches story when he 
lived on his sister’s couch. And he took its rise 
to ubiquity all in stride. When Billboard deemed 
it not country enough to place on the country 
charts, the infamous Billy Ray Cyrus remix was 
released to really play up the country energies 
Lil Nas X was certain of. This only furthered his 
song’s starhood, it eventually making history for 
topping the Hot 100 for 19 consecutive weeks. 
This eventually spun the track off to various 
other remixes that pervaded popular culture and 
furthered its reach — but that’s not the point. “Old 
Town Road” defines 2019 in its effortless ability 
to adapt to and navigate our social spheres in a 
digital age that doesn’t take itself too seriously. 
— Diana Yassin, Daily Arts Writer

4. Lana Del Ray, “The Greatest” 
“The culture is lit and if this is it, I had a ball,” 
croons Lana Del Rey in her song “The Greatest” 

from her album Norman Fucking Rockwell!. 
While a tad pessimistic, the line is fitting for the 
end of one decade and the start of a new one. As 
2020 slowly gets rolling, “The Greatest” becomes 
increasingly 
–– 
worryingly 
–– 
prophetic, 
“Hawaii just missed that fireball / L.A. is in 
flames, it’s getting hot,” and as the climate crisis 
drives the flames hotter, “The Greatest” feels 
like the conclusion of something equally terrible 
and great. Del Rey’s somber, melancholy track 
is on our list for how well it encapsulates the 
rapidly changing times. 
There is a tangible sense of frustration, 
distress and loss that rang through 2019 –– but 
there is also a sense of undeniable optimism for 
the coming year. Del Rey sings that “I want shit 
to feel just like it used to,” and while certainly 
it can be difficult not to long for days gone by, 
rose-tinted through our iPhone screens, change 
is unique in its ability to be positive or negative. 
2019 may not have ended on the foot we wanted, 
but time is on our side to change direction to a 
grander future. “Don’t leave, I just need a wake-
up call.” Think instead that the greatest is yet to

5. 100 Gecs, “money machine” 
The first time I played “money machine” for 
my dad, he said, “If you told me this was a comedy 
sketch parodying modern pop music, I would 
believe you.” Except “money machine” is no 
joke and 100 gecs has thousands of fans playing 
their post-ironic pop masterpiece. This song is 
shaking up the game with hilariously goofy yet 
absurdly catchy lyrics. When 100 gecs was asked 
about their songwriting process in a Reddit 
AMA, Laura Les explained how her iconic intro 
to “money machine” came about: “I just came up 
with it on the spot.” It’s unconventionally noisey 
and over — processed brilliance. And if you think 
this song is some sort of blasphemous taint on all 
that Good Music™ stands for, then all I have to 
say to you is: “Hey you lil’ piss baby, you think 
you’re so fucking cool?”
— Dylan Yono, Daily Arts Writer

6. FKA Twigs, “Cellophane” 
FKA Twigs’s Mary Magdalene era is marked 
by the release of “Cellophane” following a 
four-year hiatus from music. This break was 
characterized by devastating news for Twigs, 
from her breakup with former vampire Robert 
Pattinson (and its highly publicized nature) to 
her suffering from fibroid tumors. The result is a 
shattered interiority that falls apart just as much 
as it shines across MAGDALENE. Her emotional 
afflictions are as potent as the physical ones, and 
this sentiment peaks with “Cellophane.” Twigs 
aches over a sparse, glitchy beat that synchopates 
and chugs ever so delicately as she exposes the 
fragile nature of a failing relationship under 
the public gaze. She is vulnerable and bare, her 
voice and emotions palpable and resonant. It 
feels almost an intrusive listen, as though the 
listener is reading through someone’s personal 
diary as she croons, “They’re waiting, they’re 
watching / They’re watching us, they’re hating 
/ They’re hoping / I’m not enough.” The result 
is a devastatingly beautiful song that gathers all 
the turmoil and reflection following the end of 
a relationship where it felt like the other party 
wasn’t trying hard enough. 
 — Diana Yassin, Daily Arts Writer

7. BROCKHAMPTON, “SUGAR”
Although BROCKHAMPTON’s 2019 release, 
GINGER, wasn’t exactly a fan-favorite, one song 
in particular stood out. “SUGAR,” the second song 
off the album and hands-down the most popular, 
really struck a chord with the group’s audience. 
Arguably the most BROCKHAMPTON-esque 
song of the whole release, “SUGAR” was already 
the most played song off the album once the whole 
project was released. It’s true skyrocket to fame 
was its popularity on Tik Tok (unfortunately), 
and now it is possibly the group’s most popular 
song to date.
The song is like a lot of what made 

BROCKHAMPTON famous back in the days of 
the SATURATION trilogy. The hook has sweet 
vocals by Ryan Beatty and ends on the signature 
mumblings of bearface. The soft rap sound is 
reminiscent of songs like “BLEACH,” one of 
BROCKHAMPTON’s 
most 
enduring 
songs. 
Perhaps BROCKHAMPTON’s best release of the 
year, “SUGAR” was a monumental release.

B-SIDE: DIGITAL CULTURE NOTEBOOK

The terribly crazy year that was 2019 has 
come to a close, and though most are glad 
to have it in the past and see what the new 
decade brings, it would be a shame to not 
muse on the strange and wonderful year it 
was for gaming. From the revival of classic 
franchises to the success of numerous indie 
darlings, as the year comes to a close, let’s take 
a look at the best gaming experiences it had to 
offer. Here are The Daily’s picks for the best 
video games of 2019.

1. “Fire Emblem: Three 
Houses”
There are a million things I could say 
about “Fire Emblem: Three Houses” — 
how it perfects the standard gameplay of 
the series to make it more accessible for 
new players without sacrificing difficulty 
and depth, how you can play the game four 
different times and experience four distinct 
story pathways all totaling up to hundreds 
of hours of content, how the game got me 
to buy DLC just so I could pet cats — but I 
think the best testimonial I can offer is how 
it has firmly embedded itself into my mind. 
Ever since I first booted up the title screen, 
I haven’t been able to stop thinking about 
“Fire Emblem: Three Houses.”
The quick and dirty summary of “Three 
Houses” is that you play as a mercenary-
turned-professor at a medieval military 
academy, smack dab in the middle of a 

continent on the brink of war. Over the 
course of many years, you follow the 
professor and their students (from one 
of the titular three houses you choose to 
teach, each representing a certain slice 
of aforementioned continent), and how 
you and these students grow, change and 
challenge each other.
Even though you can kind of facetiously 
boil it down to “be gay do war crimes,” the 
classic video game suspension of belief 
kicks in and allows you to fall for the most 
loveable group of idiot students you’ll want 
to both strangle and hug as you remind 
them that everything is going to be alright. 
Though the gameplay and quality of life 
improvements to the franchise are top 
notch, the character design does the real 
leg work here, imbuing these kids with 
some of the most intimate and relatable 
stories, despite the overarching narrative 
ultimately being a tale of knights and kings 
and war.
“Three Houses” is a phenomenal game, 
and one made made all the more special 
because of the life it has taken on outside of 
my Nintendo Switch cartridge. I can’t go five 
seconds scrolling through my Twitter feed 
without seeing some fanart of characters 
pulling pranks on the professor, crushing on 
each other or having a wholesome holiday 
celebration. I would die for Marianne, and 
I want the chibi charm I have of her on my 

backpack to make that fact known to the 
world.
I had only played half a previous “Fire 
Emblem” game before picking up “Three 
Houses,” and if you went back to the 
summer and told me I would be so in love 
with this game to the point of drawing 
my own fanart of my favorite characters, 
or hypothesizing with my girlfriend and 
roommate about how the students of the 
Blue Lions house would squabble and 
gossip with one another on a class road trip, 
I don’t think I would’ve believed you. With 
fulfilling tactical gameplay, a painfully real 
story and an incredible cast of characters, 
“Fire Emblem: Three Houses” is my game 
of the year and it should be yours too. The 
fact the fanbase has stayed strong with a 
steady pipeline of memes and art months 
after the game’s release really tells you all 
you need to know.

2. “Sekiro: Shadow Die 
Twice”
Controversial? Yes. A new beginning? 
Yes. Mentally strenuous and engaging? Yes. 
A game for everyone? No. “Sekiro: Shadows 
Die Twice” is a masterpiece of gaming 
because it does not compromise.
After 
concluding 
their 
critically 
acclaimed series “Dark Souls,” developers 
FromSoftware 
had 
a vision and stuck 
to it. That vision is 
“Sekiro”: the 15th 
century 
Japanese-
themed 
stealth 
action 
adventure 
that 
left 
gamers 
either glued to their 
screens or screaming 
at it. “Sekiro” is 
hard. 
Very, 
very 
hard. But it’s exactly 
this 
struggle 
that 
allows the player to 
appreciate the craft 
and 
sophistication 
that went into this 
game. “Sekiro” does 
not 
accommodate 
for 
its 
audience, 
the audience must 
accommodate to it. 
To endure it is to 
admire it. “Sekiro: 

Shadows Die Twice” is committed to an 
artistic message. It is that commitment that 
makes it the best game of 2019.
— Eli Lustig, Daily Arts Writer

3. “A Short Hike” 
While we all love video games because 
they let us inhabit and explore worlds where 
our wildest dreams become possible, where 
we can slay dragons or quest after legendary 
lost treasures, sometimes all we need is a 
good game that shows us the beauty in the 
ordinary, letting us take it in at our own 
pace. “A Short Hike” is exactly what the title 
says it is, and I love it for that. 
You’re a bird named Claire on vacation 
with your family, and you want to climb to 
the top of the mountain to get some decent 
cell service. Aside from some small bits of 
narrative, there’s no greater story than that.
Though the game has a clear objective, it 
doesn’t really care how or when you decide 
to do it. You can walk up the mountain by 
taking one of many trails or by forging 
your own path. You can go swimming or 
play volleyball or help a character find 
their missing headband. You can sit by 
the campfire and take your hands off the 
keyboard for a minute. The pixel art is a joy 
to marvel at, and it exudes the same charm 
as one of Nintendo’s finest outings: it’s what 
I imagine the villagers in “Animal Crossing” 
do when you’re not around.
“A Short Hike” is like your favorite 
dessert — it may only be a small treat that 
you can finish in a minute, but it’s made 
better if you take it slow, savoring every bite. 
It’s the special chocolate cake you always 
asked for on your birthday, a flavor you 
could never forget. “A Short Hike” leaves 
your heart full as much as that cake did your 
belly.

4. “Baba Is You”
It’s perhaps an objective truth that 
no one will ever be able to make a more 
perfect puzzle game than “Tetris.” 
Universally 
simple 
and 
endlessly 
replayable, even your computer-illiterate 
grandma could pick up a Game Boy and 
know exactly what “Tetris” is about 
and how to play it as soon as the first 
block drops from the top of the screen. 
I could write a whole article about this 
(I actually won’t and would rather you 
watch Matthewmatosis, one of the 

best video game channels on YouTube, 
concisely sum up said hypothetical 
article in six minutes) but that’s not my 
point. It wouldn’t be controversial to say 
the best puzzle games in recent years, like 
“Portal 2” or “The Witness,” still exist in 
the shadow of “Tetris” Peak, gracefully 
attempting but ultimately failing to 
summit it. Instead of launching yet 
another futile expedition, “Baba is You” 
just moved the whole damn mountain.
“Baba is You” starts as simple as 
“Tetris,” quite literally telling you 
everything you need to know: “Baba 
is You,” “Flag is Win,” “Rock is Push,” 
“Wall is Stop.” Simple enough, right? 
Well yes, until you realize that these 
simple three-word facts are only facts if 
the player wants them to be. Each word is 
morphed into a block that can be moved 
around however you see fit. Want to push 
the flag instead of walking through it? 
“Flag is Push.” Want to be a wall and just 
vibe around? “Wall is You.” So on and so 
forth, as you clear more and more levels 
and the game throws keys and lava and 
crabs into the mix.
It’s one of the smartest core video 
game mechanics in recent years, and 
“Baba is You” succeeds because the 
puzzle is not just finding a way to get 
to the end of the level, it’s pushing and 
pulling and morphing the rules of the 
level so the end gets to you. The game 
isn’t any pushover, but prevents itself 
from being frustratingly hard thanks 
to a handy Ctrl+Z-like feature and its 
inherent silliness. Still, “Baba” never fails 
to make me feel like a MD-PhD in puzzles 
through the tiny victory of completing a 
level.
Sure, I could look up the optimal 
solution to each level that takes the least 
amount of moves possible, but where’s 
the fun in that? The best part of “Baba 
is You” is that there’s never just one 
solution to any given level. You don’t 
find the right way to do it, you find your 
way. And even if your way is hilariously 
stupid, no one can deny it got you over 
the finish line.

‘Fire Emblem’ and other video game highlights of 2019

The most notable events around Ann Arbor in 2019

“War Requiem”
Few 
pieces 
of 
music 
carry 
the 
magnitude of meaning that can be ascribed 
to Benjamin Britten’s “War Requiem.” 
The work combines traditional requiem 
texts with poetry by Wilfred Owens about 
World War I. It calls for three separate 
performing groups: a full orchestra with 
choir and soprano soloist, a chamber 
orchestra with baritone and tenor soloists 
and a children’s choir accompanied by 
organ.
This past February, the UMS Choral 
Union, Ann Arbor Youth Chorale and Ann 
Arbor Symphony Orchestra decided to take 
on this work under the baton of conductor 
Scott Hanoian. The performance lasted 
about 90 minutes. It spanned all sorts 
of textures and styles, from traditional-
sounding Roman Catholic choral singing 
to dissonant, 20th-century orchestral 
pandemonium — it was impossible to 
escape the brutal irony of war as justified 
by 
traditional 
secular 
and 
religious 
institutions.
At the end of the work, the melodic 
interval of a tritone — the most dissonant 
interval, known by Church composers 
at one point as “the Devil in music” — 
becomes a consonant form of closure. 
Over the course of the piece, Britten 
slowly inverts the fundamental laws of 
functional Western harmony. What was 
once consonant is now dissonant, what was 
once dissonant is now consonant. 
The “War Requiem” was by far my 
most intense audience experience of the 
past year. I’ve never left a performance 
with more thoughts running through my 
head. It took days before I wanted to listen 
to music again — before I was ready to 
interrupt the perpetual experience that is 
the “War Requiem.”
— Sammy Sussman, Daily Arts Writer

Rachmaninoff at Hill 
Auditorim
In late February 2019, the Ann Arbor 
Symphony Orchestra and pianists from 
the Doctor of Musical Arts program in 
the School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
performed the best and most moving 
orchestral works over the course of 
two days of shows. I vividly remember 
listening to a live arrangement of a Sergei 
Rachmaninoff piece for the first time. I 
sat truly entranced in Hill Auditorium as 
“Finale: Alla breve” echoed off the high 
ceilings. I left the performance with a 
new fascination in Rachmaninoff. The 
performance was a characteristic example 

of how the arts — particularly the arts at 
the University can have a lasting effect on 
the audience. As I imagine the case was for 
many students in prime midterm season, I 
was able to escape the stress of consecutive 
nights spent studying by placing myself 
in Hill Auditorium. It took only these few 
hours to be rejuvenated and energized by 
listening to the masterful work done by the 
Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra and the 
University’s own pianists. This combined 
recital was the best of 2019, not only as a 
result of the quality of music being played, 
but also because of how well it represents 
the utility of experiencing the arts as a 
university student. The recital pulled me 
away from my work for a little while, and 
released me back with a new perspective 
and a new song playing in the back of my 
mind.

Teac Damsa: “Loch na 
hEala”
There is no bodily noise in ballet. 
Ballerinas do not talk, clap or whistle. They 
land each jump softly and gracefully and 
keep heavy breathing to a minimum. These 
rules are the epitome of “Swan Lake,” 
a show that is as much about its tragic 
storyline of lost love as it is about ballet itself. 
Irish dance group Teac Damsa’s modern 
interpretation of the story — performed at 
the Power Center this past November — 
pushed these conventions to the wayside. 
Characters spoke, grunted and screamed, 
swans clapped and stomped, people shook 
plastic tarps and threw cinder blocks. In 
doing so, they stripped “Swan Lake” of its 
classical identity to present the story’s most 
organic form: “Loch na hEala,” a gripping 
story of darkness. 
During the one-act show, protagonist 
Jimmy struggles to fight his depression in 
the aftermath of his father’s death. Using 
the gun gifted to him by his mother, he 
attempts to kill himself while standing 
by the side of a lake’s gloomy waters. As 
he raises the weapon to his head, a swan 
named Finola diverts and captivates him. 
Together, the two characters dance in an 
ephemeral moment of darkly emotional 
movement 
before 
being 
aggressively 
separated by Finola’s rapist, a priest who is 
also the show’s narrator. 
I first went and wrote about the show 
for a class, but by the time Teac Damsa 
was done with its 90-minute performance 
I knew its impact would continue to touch 
me for far longer than the semester, or 

even the year. While the synopsis might 
sound disconnected from the original 
19th-century ballet, I was most captivated 
by its similarities. In the original ballet, 
Odette is also a swan cursed by a male 
predator. Prince Siegfried is also a man 
who struggles to find his purpose, and 
both characters suffer because of their 
misunderstandings. Teac Damsa’s founder, 
Michael Keegan-Dolan, reached deep into 
the original story to find these similarities, 
producing a modern essence of an old 
show: darkness, depression and the lasting 
effects of power abuse. In doing so, he 
reminded audiences about the timelessness 
of dance itself. Without a doubt, it was the 
best performance of 2019.

The Final BLED Fest
2019 saw the last installation of BLED 
Fest, a small festival showcasing some 
of the biggest up-and-coming names 
in punk, indie rock and metal. The 
festival began over 15 years ago as a 
small house show, eventually expanding 
into the all-day festival it is today with 
multiple shows spanning across the high 
school campus turned festival grounds. 
Performances from modern punk legends 
and local newcomers alike took place in 
gymnasiums, cafeterias and classrooms. 
While this festival took place just outside 
of Ann Arbor and gained considerable 
national 
attention, 
its 
do-it-yourself 
roots still shone through as local bands 
from southeastern Michigan, including 
Ann Arbor, littered the lineup. Groups 
like Dogleg, Ness Lake, the Doozers and 
Complainer all played heavily attended 
sets. 
While it does involve a community just 
slightly larger than Ann Arbor, the final 
installation of BLED Fest proved to be a 
significant event that was different from 
any other summer music festival, not 
only because it took place inside of a high 
school, but also because of its unique lineup 
that featured members of the southeastern 
Michigan music community. 
This installment of BLED Fest also 
proved to be the most diverse, both in terms 
of genre and artist personnel. While the 
original BLED Fest featured heavier music 
performed by mostly white males, the final 
installation of the festival featured hip-
hop, spoken word and singer/songwriter 
acts with a wide variety of identities, 
allowing the festival to end on a different, 
more diverse chapter than it started on.

The Polar Vortex
The Tuesday night before the Polar 
Vortex, my housemates and I were in the 
kitchen making dinner when we were 
alerted about the cancellation of classes for 
the next two days. Within a minute, Jacob 
had made us a Facebook event: ENTER 
THE VORTEX. The cover photo showed 
our house in the middle of a storm system 
map that posited Michigan to be colder 
than the Arctic for the next 24 hours. We 
were having a darty.
The following day was filled with ski 
shots, blankets and mulled wine. The 
crowd was composed of individuals who 
had actually left their houses that day to 
come over. This sense of comradery was 
not bound by the house’s walls.
Everyone at the university seems to 
remember last January’s Polar Vortex 
fondly. Some stayed in and spent quality 
time with their roommates. Some painted 
the scenery. Others trekked across campus 
to the promise of warm drinks and good 
company elsewhere. I personally went to 
see “Your Name” at the Michigan Theater 
after the party. We all proved creative and 
robust.
At the same time, though, we were 
shielded from the storm’s ugly side by 
warm abodes and comfortable clothes. It 
proved a hardship for many others, and 
even though it was memorable, let’s hope 
to leave such callous weather in 2019. 
— Ben Vassar, Daily Arts Writer

18th Annual Clown 
Show
As someone who is truly terrified of 
clowns, it feels strange saying this, but 
my favorite event of 2019 was hands 
down the 18th Annual Clown Show (also 
known as the final presentation for the 
class “Physical Theatre”). The Clown 
Show acts as the final assessment for a 
senior BFA acting class in which majors 
develop a clown persona and perform 
short improvisations for about an hour. 
The clowns perform short 15-30 second 
“noodles” (brief solo improvisations) as 
well as loosely structured partner scenes. 
They perform in the heart of finals week — 
right after classes end and right before the 
first week of exams — in the Arthur Miller 
Theater. The house is always packed, the 
admission is always free and the evening 
is always bubbling over with laughter. 
This year, as with every year, the acts were 
wonderfully unpolished; the audience got 
the delicious chance to see actors’ minds at 

work. We got to laugh when they failed and 
laugh even harder when they found a spark 
of success (which sometimes took the form 
of an earnest failure). 
As a member of SMTD, this event always 
means a lot to me. Regardless of the finals 
or the papers, everyone finds a way to make 
it out for the clown show and share warm 
laughter together before the cold isolation 
of exam time. In the stressful period when 
everyone is asking the students to plan 
ahead, we get to turn that off and be present 
for an hour to watch people try to make us 
happy, if only by accident or for a fleeting 
moment. I can’t quite explain what exactly 
makes it so joyful; perhaps it stems from 
that mischievous sense of schadenfreude 
inside all of us, or perhaps because it is the 
beginning of a series of goodbyes to the 
senior acting class, and the happiest one 
we’ll probably ever get. 
Regardless of the reason, the Clown 
Show — and all of the community, warmth 
and delightful distraction it brought — 
slipped over a banana peel and landed at 
the top of my 2019 list.
— Stephanie Guralnick, Daily Arts Writer

2019 Protests
I came home for fall break in October to 
an unusual sight: My parents were nestled 
in the living room, art supplies strewn 
haphazardly around them, drawing a large 
peach on a white board. My mother’s eyes 
glistened mischievously as she looked up 
at me. “I’m going to draw Trump on this 
peach,” she giggled, then proceeded to 
pick out a brilliant orange from the sea of 
colored pencils in front of her. Political 
action and protests have always been an 
important part of my family’s life, and 2019 
was a big year in politics. Protest events 
littered my facebook feed the whole year: 
I attended the climate strike in Ann Arbor, 
the gun control rally in Detroit and the 
women’s march in Ann Arbor, and that 
wasn’t enough. These issues are far from 
mutually exclusive, and I urge everyone to 
resist confining them to their own isolated 
spheres. If you care about tackling climate 
change, chances are you’re in favor of 
background checks for gun purchasing as 
well. If you’ve never been, attend a protest 
or two in 2020, to listen and observe if 
nothing else. Let 2020 be the year where 
you give a sh*t.
