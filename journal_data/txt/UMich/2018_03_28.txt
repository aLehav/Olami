Regarding what issue she 

wanted to see prioritized in 
the University of Michigan’s 
Central 
Student 
Government 

elections, Public Policy senior 
Gloriela Iguina-Colón expressed 
one of many shared sentiments 
on campus: a need for diversity 
of representation and a rise in 
student leaders who prioritize 
engaging with individuals in 
the University and Ann Arbor 
community.

Iguina-Colón 
worked 
as 

a deputy campaign manager 
for 
the 
MomentUM 
party, 

and 
highlighted 
her 
work 

with Engineering junior A.J. 
Ashman and LSA junior Charlie 

Bingham as an integral part of 
her experience in the campaign 
movement.

“CSG has lacked representation 

of different identities and thus 
has 
excluded 
marginalized 

voices. MomentUM is about 
genuinely 
bringing 
everyone 

into the conversation,” she said. 
“This starts by acknowledging 
that these problems exist. That 
people and their identities are 
not invisible. But rather their 
identities and experiences are 
primordial.”

CSG elections, which took 

place last week Wednesday and 
Thursday, resulted in a landslide 
victory for MVision’s executive 
candidates, 
Public 
Policy 

junior Daniel Greene and LSA 
sophomore Izzy Baer, amassing 
3,439 votes. The second-place 

David, a Social Work student 

at the University of Michigan, 
tried Vicodin for the first time 
when he was 17. 

“I’ve never felt this good in my 

life,” David, who requested his 
last name remain anonymous, 
said.

His doctor prescribed him the 

drug in order to alleviate any pain 
he may feel after undergoing a 
wisdom tooth surgery. The next 
year, after a lacrosse injury at the 
University of Georgia, a doctor 
prescribed him the drug again. 
When Vicodin didn’t suffice, 
his doctors prescribed Percocet. 
After one month of taking the 
prescription pain medication, he 
was addicted.

“I ended up taking it for about 

a month and tried to stop, (but) 
it’s pretty addicting,” David said. 
“Then I started buying (opioids) 
from the streets from friends, 
and eventually started writing 
fake prescriptions so I could get 
more.”

When David started graduate 

school at the University, he 
reached out to the Collegiate 
Recovery Program, a support 
service for students who are 
recovering from alcohol and 
drug addiction that has branches 
at universities throughout the 
country. The University chapter, 
run single-handedly by Program 
Manager Matt Statman, seeks to 
help students in recovery do well 

in school and enjoy their time at 
the University without alcohol 
or drugs. 

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

sophomore Julia, who requested 
her name be changed to remain 
anonymous, 
struggled 
with 

alcohol addiction in middle 
school and high school and 
described 
the 
program 
as 

“crucial” in aiding students with 
finding community outside of 
college drinking culture.

“I think it was because it 

was hard for me to find a way 
to connect with people in my 
dorm socially because so much 

of it was bonding over partying, 
or rushing or stuff like that, 
and I had no interest in either 
of those,” Julia said. “CRP was 
really crucial in a social way for 
me to be able to find people who 
I had something in common 
with and were pursuing the 
same things that I was.”

Julia started drinking and 

smoking marijuana when she 
was 13 years old. Proudly calling 
herself a “weekend warrior,” she 
would spend the entire weekend 
drunk or high, but usually did 
not indulge during the week. 
However, after spending days 

in the hospital and threatening 
suicide, she joined a rehab 
program her senior year of high 
school. About seven months into 
the program, she said she “really 
wanted to get sober” after 
realizing the core of many of her 
problems was addiction.

Julia decided to take a gap 

year 
before 
starting 
school 

at the University, and while 
meeting with a voice teacher 
in Ann Arbor over the summer 
for a vocal lesson, she met 
up with Statman. She said 
acknowledging her addiction 

On 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 

Michigan State Treasurer Nick 
Khouri addressed an audience 
of about 75 students, faculty 
and 
community 
members 

as part of the University of 
Michigan Center for Local, 
State, and Urban Policy lecture 
series, titled “Fiscal policy in 
Michigan: Past, present, and 
future”, to discuss the primary 
focuses of the state treasury 
moving forward.

Khouri, a University alum, 

was appointed state treasurer 
by Gov. Rick Snyder in April 
2015 after working in the 
private sector as vice president 
of Corporate Affairs at DTE 
Energy in Detroit. His role 
as 
state 
treasurer 
involves 

collecting 
and 
investing 

state 
money, 
advising 
the 

governor on tax and revenue 
policy, collecting state taxes, 
overseeing state credit and 
ensuring 
local 
government 

financial health.

Panelists discussed intersectionality, social injustices, and overcoming barriers to access

The second annual “Seat at 

the Table” was hosted Tuesday 
evening 
by 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Students 
of 

Color in Public Policy in the 
Michigan Union. The event, 
including 
four 
panelists 
of 

color, created a dialogue on 
issues of intersectionality, social 
injustices and illuminating the 
voices of women of color. 

The theme for the panel was 

“Sister 
Outsider,” 
based 
on 

Audre Lorde’s 1984 collection 
of poems and essays of the 
same title that touches upon 
similar issues. Juliana Pino 
Alcaraz,

During the final meeting of 

the seventh council of Central

at 
the 

University of Michigan, many 
representatives spoke about what 
CSG meant to them over the past 
year, the experiences and growth 
they will take away and concerns 
for future engagement.

At the beginning of the 

meeting, 
Business 
junior

Surveying 
the 
crowd 

gathered in Hutchins Hall at 
the University of Michigan 
Tuesday afternoon, the first 
thing Justice Albie Sachs asked 
of the more than 100 attendees 
was that they sit down.

“It’s 
wonderful 
and 
it’s 

despairing to see so many 
people standing — puts a lot 
of pressure on the speaker,” 
he 
said, 
referring 
to 
the 

dozens of students, professors 
and 
University 
staff 
who 

were unable to find seats 
at the Law School’s 2018 
William W. Bishop Lecture in 
International Law.

The annual Bishop Lecture 

has 
previously 
featured 

Mary Robinson, the former 
president of Ireland, and Judge 

Navi Pillay, the former United 
Nations High Commissioner 
on Human Rights.

Sachs, a native of South 

Africa, 
was 
a 
freedom 

fighter in the anti-apartheid 
movement and a former judge 
on the country’s constitutional 
court. As a law student in the 
1950s, Sachs joined the African 
National Congress and began 
advocacy work to combat the 
racist statutes of apartheid.

He was first arrested at 

17 years old for violating 
segregation laws. When the 
judge found out how old he 
was, Sachs was released into 
his mother’s custody.

“Which was a big letdown,” 

Sachs joked. “I wanted to be a 
revolutionary hero.”

Sachs was later raided by 

the security police and placed 
in solitary confinement for 
168 days without trial. He 
went into exile in 1966. Two 

decades later, while living in 
Mozambique, South African 
government forces attempted 
to assassinate him with a car 
bomb.

The explosives were planted 

on the wrong side of his 
vehicle, and Sachs survived 
but lost his right arm and 

went blind in one eye. Sachs 
said while he was recovering 
from the attack, he received 
a note from his allies in the 
anti-apartheid movement that 
read, “Don’t worry, comrade 
Albie, we will avenge you.”

Sachs rejected an eye-for-

an-eye mentality.

“What kind of world will 

it be if everyone is blind and 
without arms?” Sachs said. “If 
we get democracy, if we get 
the rule of law, that will be my 
soft vengeance.”

Included in the title of a 

1991 book he wrote about his 
recovery from the attack as 
well as a documentary about 
his 
life, 
“soft 
vengeance” 

signals retaliation based not 
on retribution, but success. 
Sachs said putting an end 
to the oppression he spent 

his life fighting was his “soft 
vengeance.”

“What was the one good 

thing 
apartheid 
did?” 

Sachs said. “It created anti-
apartheid. And it was because 
of apartheid I met Nelson 
Mandela.”

In 1990, the South African 

government yielded and the 
apartheid 
state 
collapsed. 

The country’s first national 
multiracial 
elections 
were 

held in 1994 and Mandela 
was elected president. He 
appointed Sachs to one of the 
11 seats on the Constitutional 
Court, South Africa’s version 
of the Supreme Court. During 
Sachs’s tenure on the bench, 
the court abolished the death 
penalty and overturned laws 
criminalizing homosexuality. 

Sachs 
advocated 
heavily 

for the inclusion of a bill of 
rights in South Africa’s new 
constitution 
and 
argued 

that the document should 
include rights to housing, 
water, health care and a clean 
environment.

Nausiza Palawzo, a student 

at 
Washtenaw 
Community 

College, said she appreciated 
Sachs’s discussion of Ubuntu 
philosophy, 
an 
idea 
in 

southern Africa that roughly 
translates to a belief that all 
people are connected to one 
another.

“I think that’s the way to go, 

just recognizing each other as 
human beings,” Palawzo said. 
“In Western society, people 
can focus a little bit excessively 
on individualism.”

Caroline 
Kim, 
assistant 

director of the Program on 
Intergroup Relations, lived in 
South Africa for five years. She 
said having Sachs speak at the 
University was an “incredible 
honor.”

“This 
was 
absolutely 

surreal,” she said. “I was just 
in South Africa last week and 
just having gotten back, it’s 
totally surreal.”

The University of Michigan 

set the stage for two Hollywood 
personalities on Tuesday as 
students frantically traced the 
stars via social media. Steve 
Carell, famed movie actor and 
television star, was spotted 
on a campus tour with his 
daughter. “Star Trek” actor 
Zachary Quinto was also seen 
on campus purchasing a mid-
day coffee at Starbucks on 
State Street. 

The 
celebrity 
sightings 

stirred up social media activity 

with 
photos 
corroborating 

their 
campus 
appearance. 

Some tweets captured Carell 
walking 
into 
the 
Student 

Activities Building to meet the 
tour and standing outside in a 
black baseball cap, black coat 
and dark sunglasses.

According 
to 
WMTV 

Channel 
15 
in 
Madison, 

Wis., Carell visited in the 
University 
of 
Wisconsin-

Madison on Monday prior to 
his appearance in Ann Arbor. 
Carell is best known for his 
role in the TV show, “The 
Office” and movies including 
the “Despicable Me” series and 
“Crazy, Stupid, Love”.

LSA 
sophomore 
Rebecca 

Bernstein saw Carell and his 
family checking out of the 
Graduate 
Hotel 
on 
Huron 

Street. While excited about his 
presence on campus, she was 
concerned about his celebrity 
status as he roamed campus 
for personal reasons.

“It was pretty cool to see a 

celebrity on campus, especially 
one who is so beloved by our 
generation,” Bernstein said. 
“I did feel bad for him because 
I 
could 
not 
imagine 
him 

simply trying to enjoy family 
time while being stalked by 
thousands of students.”

LSA sophomore Ilana Char 

also saw Carell on Tuesday.

“I just hope his daughter 

had a good tour and good luck 
to her as she starts the college 
process,” Char said.

While social media stirred 

about the presence of Carell 
on 
campus, 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Claire 
Stemper 

snapped a discrete photo of 
another 
celebrity, 
Zachary 

Quinto. Quinto most notably 
played Spock in “Star Trek.”

“We made eye contact once, 

but I don’t think he wanted 
to be bothered so I didn’t say 
anything, just stared a bit,” 
Stemper said. “I was definitely 
starstruck.”

March 28, 1981 (vol. 91, iss. 

144, Page 1)

By David Crawford

Poised with one knee on a 

chair, the phone receiver resting 
on her shoulder, she looks into 
the horizon. A floodlight hung at 
the left lightens the shadows on 
her naked body. 

Half an hour later, she is in the 

same position. After the students 
finish drawing, she alks off the 
stage and reaches for her robe. 
Her job as a model for Figure 
Drawing 102 is over for a while. 

To some, the idea of model-

ing nude is risque, but for most 
people enrolled in figure drawing 
classes “it’s nothing,” said one 
student. 

Some students admitted they 

were embarrassed the first time 
they saw a naked model. Senior 
American Studies Major Corinne 
Coen recalled that at the first 
drawing session, the model took 

off his clothes before the class’ 
professor arrived. Coen said she 
was shocked and intimidated 
because “I didn’t know what to 
draw.” 

“Everyone turns red, but the 

models aren’t embarrassed,” said 
freshwoman art student Amy 
Ewald. 

Sophomore Art student Robin 

Kandel explained that after a 
time, “you’re not viewing (the 
model) as a sexual thing. The 
model becomes an object and 
you concentrate on your work.” 

According to Art School Dean 

George Bayliss, using nude mod-
els instead of

clothed ones is “an essential 

thing to do. Reference points 
have to be seen.”

Administrative Assistant 

Pat St. George, who hires and 
schedules models, emphasized 
that a “professional” approach 
is taken in nude modeling. On 
the stage, she explained, the 

model is a figure for the artist to 
draw, but in the five-minute rest 
period between poses, the model 
“becomes himself again.”

Since administrative guide-

lines state that the model 
should be undressed only when 
necessary, the model is required 
to wear a fulhlength robe, she 
added.

According to Art Prof. Julia 

Andrews, the objective of Figure 
Drawing (one of four art- school 
prerequisite courses for upper-
level classes) is for students “to 
learn about the proportion of the 
human body, how it moves and 
articulates, and how to transpose 
a moving three-dimensional 
form which exists in space to a 
two-dimensional flat surface.”

“It’s hard to draw the clothed 

form,”

Andrews explained, because it 

is difficult to see “the structure 
and mechanics of the body.”

ELIZABETH LAWRENCE

Daily Staff Reporter

ON THE DAILY: SEATTLE SCHOOLS SEEKING ANN ARBOR 
SUPERINTENDENT SWIFT

Former South African freedom fighter 
talks anti-apartheid advocacy work

LEAH GRAHAM
Daily Staff Reporter

“What kind of 
world will it be 
if everyone is 

blind and without 

arms? If we get 
demcoracy... that 
will be my soft 

vengeance.”


Public Policy professor Barry 
Rabe touched on the unique 
contours of the past decade of 
Michigan economic history. 

“This is a state that has 

had good times and bad times 
over the past half-century and 
beyond,” Rabe said. “What an 
interesting decade we have been 
through, what an interesting 
time the Snyder years have 
been in the fiscal condition in 
the state of Michigan.”

Khouri 
began 
his 
talk 

by calling attention to the 
highlights 
of 
the 
current 

Michigan 
economy. 
As 
of 

January, state unemployment is 
at 4.7 percent, down from 14.6 
percent during the recession in 
2009. Personal income growth 
has outpaced the national rate, 
and Michigan has successfully 
diversified 
its 
employment 

base away from manufacturing 
and 
into 
sectors 
such 
as 

professional 
and 
business 

services. Khouri said now there 
are jobs available, the task at 
hand is adequately training 
employees to be efficient in 
those roles.

“It’s the real focus now 

of everybody,” Khouri said. 
“These jobs are available now, 
at least during this part of 
the cycle. How do we get the 
employees trained and ready to 
take the jobs that are available 
right now?”

While the state has mostly 

recovered to its position prior to 
the recession, it is experiencing 
a downward shift in its size and 

relative wealth compared to the 
rest of the nation.

“We’ve had to painfully, 

slowly adjust our budget and 
our fiscal policy towards this 
change in relative deterioration 
in the economy,” Khouri said.

Khouri gave an overview 

of the tax revenue, with over 
85 percent generated from the 
property, income and state 
taxes. He noted that the tax 
burden on Michiganders has 
decreased, as Michigan has 
only the 30th highest taxes in 
the nation.

Before the final part of his 

talk in which he mentioned 
policy focus areas for the 
future, 
Khouri 
addressed 

the 
struggles 
of 
Michigan 

local governments, of which 
there are 1,800. He said both 
rural and urban areas alike 
are 
encountering 
economic 

challenges.

“When 
we 
talk 
about 

the 
fiscal 
health 
of 
local 

governments, the answer is 
it depends,” Khouri said. “It 
really does vary by geography, 
by size, by function. It’s not 
just urban areas. Some of the 
districts that are struggling 
the most are in the (Upper 
Peninsula).”

Among the issues facing 

local 
governments, 
Khouri 

mentioned the lack of diversity 
in 
their 
revenue 
sources, 

that they rely too heavily 
on property taxes. Another 
pressing issue is the unfunded 
liabilities 
of 
pensions 
and 

healthcare.

“I know there’s this question 

of justice, of what retirees need 
and deserve, that’s not what 
I’m talking about, although 

it is what I’m talking about,” 
Khouri said. “What I’m talking 
about is the unfunded liabilities 
continue to grow and (the local 
government’s) ability to service 
that is not growing at the same 
pace.”

As Khouri turned toward 

the future of the Michigan 
economy, 
he 
showed 

predictions 
of 
economic 

expansion, with the treasury’s 
general fund and school aid 
revenues rising.

He outlined objectives of 

sustaining current progress, 
avoiding yo-yo fiscal policy and 
preparing for next recession. 
These objectives necessitate 
addressing long-term spending 
needs while the economy is 
good, reforming the tax system 
to match the evolving economy 
and improving the fiscal health 
of local governments across 
Michigan.

He ended his talk with advice 

to the public policy students in 
the audience.

“You’re the next generation 

of policymakers,” Khouri said. 
“I think you’ll do fine. Just 
focus on the basics. Focus on 
the policy, not the politics. 
Take a longer-term view of 
what’s required and not just a 
short-term view.”

LSA sophomore Johnny Luo, 

who will be studying public 
policy at the Gerald R. Ford 
School of Public Policy next 
year, said he was motivated 
to come to the event for 
professional 
development, 

as well as his coursework in 
economic inequality. Luo said 
he thought the new generation 
of 
policymakers 
would 

bring a fresh perspective to 

solving Michigan’s economic 
challenges.

“The thing (Khouri) talked 

about so many times was that 
we need new energy in our 
state policies and our state 
legislature,” Luo said. “I think 
that’s the way — some new idea 
or new ideologies.”

After his talk, Khouri fielded 

specific questions from a panel 
of graduate students enrolled 

in a public budgeting course. 
The students had collected 
submissions from the audience 
and via Twitter. When asked 
what he most wished the public 
understood about his domain, 
Khouri said he wished people 
understood the trade-offs that 
come with policy.

“Like 
life, 
broad 
public 

policy issues are always trade-
offs,” Khouri said. “They’re 
never black and white. I think, 
without really thinking about 
it, I wish people understood 
that most of these typical 
questions are balancing acts 
between two goods, and it’s not 
good and bad.”

Ashman and Charlie Bingham, 
won 1,927 votes.

Some, 
like 
outgoing 

representative Matt Thomas, 
an LSA senior, commended the 
representation of communities 
in the assembly. 

Outogoing 
CSG 
President 

Anushka Sarkar, an LSA senior, 
expressed her disappointment 
with the significant amount of 
voters who wrote in Reggie the 
Campus Corgi. 1,403 students 
wrote in Reggie, 63 votes shy 
of the True Blue candidates, 
Business junior Arathi Sabada 
and LSA sophomore Marianne 
Drysdale. 
She 
criticized 

popular news outlets, such 
as the Detroit Free Press and 
BuzzFeed, for adding coverage 
to Reggie’s “campaign” and 
delegitimizing the work of 
student candidates.

In order to combat the lack 

of 
informed 
voting 
among 

students, Sarkar outlined the 
importance of the Big Ten 
Voting Challengeas a way in 
which students can learn the 
importance of civic engagement 
and understand how voting 
processes take place.

“Fostering a commitment to 

voting and civic engagement 
at a young age is incredibly 
important,” Sarkar wrote in 
an email interview. “It’s not 
because people don’t understand 
CSG that people voted for 
a dog. It’s not because CSG 
doesn’t do anything that people 
are 
disengaged 
with 
their 

representative body and resort 
to memes and throwaway votes. 
It’s because of a larger problem 
of insufficient education around 
civic engagement. It’s because 
proving to people that their 
representative body truly does 
work in their best interests is 
an age-old battle with which 
governments 
have 
been 

struggling.”

Sarkar 
pushed 
the 

importance 
of 
INNOVATE, 

CSG’s public service pitch 
competition, and the Diag 
events as avenues through 
which CSG can interact with 
students on campus and show 
the type of work happening 
within 
CSG, 
as 
well 
as 

legitimizing CSG positions to 
students unfamiliar with their 
efforts.

Though Sarkar supported 

the 
True 
Blue 
campaign 

during 
this 
election, 
she 

voiced her admiration for all 
those who ran as candidates 
and her hopes for the future.

“I have faith in Daniel Greene 

and Izzy Baer to lead this 
organization and student body 
with integrity, with emphasis 
on 
empowering 
marginalized 

students, and maintaining the 
momentum of this year,” Sarkar 
wrote. “I have faith in the elected 
Assembly Representatives to give 
voice to their communities and 
schools. And I have faith that 
the values Arathi and Marianne 
represented in leadership of True 
Blue will be embodied in this next 
year of CSG,” Sarkar wrote.

as she proposed a resolution 
to make graduation a more 
equitable

This 
includes 

providing regalia and headshot

West 
emphasized 
the 

importance of students of all

“We have to make sure we

“I think the thing we revisit 

year and year, and every time 
we have elections, is ‘what does 
CSG do?’ and ‘what has CSG 
done for me?’” Jawad said. “It 
has to be your mission to leave

it. I can honestly say that I have 
given everything I could to this 
organization, to this campus 
in my four years. While I made 
mistakes and all, I can truly feel 
that I left something here that I 
love so much and it will hurt a lot 
to leave it.”

“How do we get 
the employees 

trained and ready 

to take the jobs 
that are available 

right now?”

“We’re hoping to have a 

really lively conversation with 
the audience and the panelists,” 
Sánchez said. “It often feels like 
a lack of a voice for women of 
color, so it’s important to see 
those voices at the table.”

The panelists included Ashley 

Tuomi, the executive director 
of American Indian Health and 
Family Services of Southeastern 
Michigan; 
Desiree 
Cooper, 

a 
former 
attorney, 
Pulitzer 

Prize-nominated journalist and 
reproductive 
rights 
activist; 

Mahima Mahadevan, a New 
American 
Leaders 
Michigan 

program 
coordinator; 
and 

Sandra O’Brien, the chair of 
Wayne State University’s Board 
of Governors.

After 
introductions 
of 

each of the panelists by SCPP 
President Gabrielle Horton, a 
Ford graduate student, Alcaraz 
presented questions for each of 
the panelists.

Alcaraz first asked the panel 

about what it means for a woman 
of color to be at the table.

“There are so many white 

norms determining that space 
before we came in,” Mahadevan 
said. “Even though there are 
women that are there, there 
are so many norms that we are 
struggling to push against.”

Tuomi commented on what 

she has witnessed in her career 

so far.

“There’s 
almost 
this 

competition among women to 
be at the table,” Tuomi said. 
“We fall into the trap of tearing 
each other down rather than 
bringing each other up, so find 
a way that we make comprises 
and help each other.”

Cooper also mentioned the 

workplace 
discrimination 

women often face for having or 
wanting to have children.

“I’ve spoken to a lot of 

audiences and always ask this 
question,” Cooper said. “How 
many 
women 
have 
hidden 

the fact that they are having 
children, or are pregnant, or are 
planning to be?”

The 
answer 
was 
many. 

Alcaraz also posed the question 
of 
what 
mentorship 
from 

women of color has meant to 
the panelists through their 
experiences.

Cooper responded to this 

question first, bringing in her 
experience 
working 
at 
the 

Detroit Free Press, where she 
said she was initially underpaid 
for the work that she did. Cooper 
said only after an older woman 
of color made Cooper aware of 
it, did she stand up for herself.

“There is still a taboo that 

(women) don’t talk about and 
that is money,” Cooper said. 
“Let’s talk about that and that is 
a huge validation of our power.”

O’Brien, who is the only 

person of Latinx descent to 
serve in her position at the 
University, 
spoke 
from 
her 

experiences working in the 
judicial system.

“Without 
somebody 
that 

looks like you, whether it’s a 
female or a person of color, 
there’s a higher probability that 
your interests won’t get served,” 
O’Brien said.

For the final question, the 

panelists gave advice to their 
younger selves at the beginning 
of their careers.

“You can do it all,” O’Brien 

said. “I grew up with modest 
means on a farm, and I’m the 
first in college of my family. 
Women can have it all, if you 
want to have a family and a 
career, then you can.”

After the questions were 

over, the panelists interacted 
with the audience to discuss 
issues with representation and 
employment.

Rackham 
student 
Save 

Gasaiwai said he came to the 
event because he heard from 
Mahadevan earlier this year 
and her ideas had resonated 
with him as a Pacific Islander 
student.

“I’ve been doing a lot of soul-

searching about what I want to 
do after I graduate,” Gasaiwai 
said. “They (the panel) really 
clarified some issues that I have 
myself have been struggling 
with like discussing my pay, 
saying if I’m good enough for a 
position, because of my position 
in society.”

was crucial to her steps towards 
assistance.

“I know people say, ‘I’m a 

person in recovery,’ just so people 
don’t get scared by the word 
alcoholic, but I’m an alcoholic,” 
Julia said.

According to Julia, one the 

largest 
obstacles 
CRP 
faces 

in attracting members is the 
stigmatization 
of 
addiction 

and recovery. CRP’s biweekly 
meetings 
average 
“around 

20 
members” 
with 
total 

membership consisting of 30 to 
40 undergraduate and graduate 
students. However, with over 
46,000 students at the University, 
she believes a lack of awareness 
about the program and its utility 
to those in recovery, along with 
the stigmatization of addiction, 
prevent students from joining.

“(The 
University 
tries) 

to push their mental health 
resources, but I think what is 
preventing more people from 
utilizing those resources is the 
nature 
of 
American 
college 

culture of heavy drinking and 
also the stigma associated with 
addiction,” Julia said. “(It’s) 
the idea that you can’t be an 
addict while you’re in college, 
or alcoholics are the homeless 
people who live on the streets in 
downtown Ann Arbor when in 
reality, it has so many more faces 
than we care to acknowledge.”

David 
echoed 
Julia’s 

sentiments and said he thinks the 
University should be more open 
to talking about recovery.

“Recovery needs to be more 

talked about at the University 
of Michigan because a lot of 
students don’t know what it is and 
have biases or stigmas against 
being in recovery or having an 
addiction problem,” David said.

A 2012 study conducted by the 

National Center on Addiction and 
Substance Abuse at Columbia 
University found that 40 million 
Americans over the age of 12 
suffer from addiction to alcohol, 
nicotine or other drugs. The 
student also found only one in 10 
of Americans who are addicted 
to alcohol or drugs, excluding 
nicotine, receive any form of 
treatment.

According 
to 
Wolverine 

Wellness 
Director 
Mary 
Jo 

Desprez, part of the problem may 
be that only certain kind of drugs 
are stigmatized.

“The words we say matter, and 

when you say, ‘I use a hard drug,’ 
that’s a stigmatizing category 
where, let’s just say somebody 
lives in an off-campus house who 
drinks a lot, they don’t get that 
same (stigmatization),” Desprez 
said.

Though 
the 
Collegiate 

Recovery 
Program 
serves 

people like David, who suffer 
from 
opioid 
addiction, 
the 

most common addiction that 
students 
struggle 
with 
in 

college is alcohol. According 
to the National College Health 

Assessment 
study 
conducted 

at the University in 2016, 46 
percent 
of 
undergraduates 

exhibited 
high-risk 
drinking 

(defined as four drinks or more 
for females and five drinks or 
more for males), while only 9 
percent of undergraduates used 
prescription 
drugs 
for 
non-

medical purposes.

Desprez said while an opiate 

crisis can be mirrored at the 
University, 
students 
are 
far 

likelier to be addicted to alcohol 
or other drugs such as marijuana 
and 
Adderall 
that 
are 
less 

stigmatized.

“If you’re seeing an opiate 

epidemic in society, it doesn’t 
show up the exact same way, 
but we’re not impervious to it,” 
Desprez said. “But on a college 
campus, the data has always 
really been clear that the number 
one drug of choice is alcohol, and 
not very far behind is marijuana, 
and then you have some of the 
study 
aid 
drugs, 
stimulant, 

misuse and things like that.”

The 
Collegiate 
Recovery 

Program 
does 
not 
provide 

treatment to those in recovery. 
Instead, it recommends that 
its 
members 
attend 
12-step 

programs, programs pioneered 
by 
Alcoholics 
Anonymous 

designed to help people through 
a 
therapeutic 
medium, 
and 

focuses on providing additional 
resources and support to students 
in recovery at the University.

MAGGIE MIHAYLOVA | COLUMN

I 

walked into the lab, finished 
with my classes for the day 
and ready to get some data. I 

had been wrestling with the lab 
equipment for weeks. The computer 
kept crashing, turning entire days 
into wasted time. Luckily, it was 
put down to its final resting place. 
We now had a brand-new computer 
and I was ready to finally get 
some results. As I was setting up, I 
realized that the laser was not lasing 
at all. To fix this kind of problem, 
you have to adjust small mirrors and 
align the inside of the laser cavity. I 
had done this before, but I had help. 
This time, I was on my own. After an 
hour of moving the beam up, down, 
left, right, a laser came out the other 
side. I had fixed it. I felt better about 
myself than I have ever felt finishing 
a homework problem set, and now I 
was ready to take data.

This type of experience was 

not a one-time thing for me, and 
not an experience only I have had. 
I have talked with many other 
undergraduates at the University of 
Michigan doing research, not just 
in physics, and a ton of them have 
had to work through issues on their 
own. Figuring out how to solve 
one of these issues is an invaluable 
experience. You not only learn a 
new skill, but you learn how to 
solve problems on your own and 
are able to gain confidence in your 
own abilities.

A lot of people stress the 

importance of doing research as 
an undergraduate, but I feel that 
they don’t always talk about the 
most important reasons for it. A 
reason commonly cited is to gain 
experience in your field to prepare 
you for graduate school. This 
is usually directed to convince 
students in the hard sciences — 
physics, biology, chemistry — to get 
into research early. It is true; it does 
help students prepare for what they 
will be expecting in graduate school, 
and as Sarah Webb pointed out in an 
article for Science, many graduate 
schools “have come to expect it.”

Though this reasoning is drilled 

into students’ heads from the 
moment they step on campus, it has 
a small scope and is often restricted 
to a specific group of students 

focused on STEM research. It raises 
the question: What about those in 
the social sciences?

I have a friend who had to 

participate in research for the 
Psychology Department for her 
marketing major. I think that this 
experience sets a great example of 
what many people should do. Just 
because she is not majoring in 
psychology does not mean she 
couldn’t participate in research 
in the field, especially since many 
of the skills she learned were 
directly applicable to her future 
marketing profession.

You could ask me, “But why 

would I do research in a field that 
might only be tangentially related 
to the field that I am in, when 
instead I could get an internship 
that directly relates to what I want 
to do?” I would respond, “Go for 
it! Do what’s best for you,” but I 
would follow that comment with 
an attempt to convince you that 
what’s best for you would be at least 
a semester of research.

An internship will look pretty 

good on your résumé. However, 
think about all the other people 
doing the same internship you are 
— maybe not exactly the same, but 
similar and standard. Employers 
have seen that résumé before; it’s 
not 
necessarily 
anything 
new. 

Nowadays, you have to stand out 
and do something different. The 
thing that could set you apart could 
be research.

However, the reason for doing 

research should not be so you can 
just stamp it on your résumé as 
another checkbox checked. The true 
value of research is what it teaches 
you. A study by John Petrella and 
Alan Jung concluded that doing 
research as an undergraduate can 
help in creating more tolerance 
for obstacles, learning to work 
independently and boosting self-
confidence, among other things. I 
have seen this while participating in 
my own research. In the example I 
opened with, I was able to deal with 
a problem that came up, figure it out 
on my own and felt better about my 
abilities afterward.

According to data from the 

United 
States 
Department 
of 

Labor, in 2017, over 60 percent of 
those between 16 and 19 years of 
age worked in either the service 
occupation or sales. Now, I am 
not disparaging anyone in these 
industries, but some of the jobs in 
these sectors, which most 16-19 
year olds take part in, do not offer 
much opportunity for ingenuity or 
discovery. I have worked both as 
a barista in a coffee shop and as a 
busboy in a restaurant, and in each 
one, I had to stick to the rules and 
steps that I was told when I started 
the jobs. There was not much 
room for creativity, and I pretty 
much just followed instructions 
and went through the motions. 
Undergraduate research offers 
a break from these types of jobs. 
You are able to work on projects 
in which you need to think 
critically and develop new ways 
of doing things.

According to the National 

Science Foundation, as of 2016, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

spends the second most money 
on research and development 
of any U.S. university. It spends 
the most out of any public school 
and is only beat by a private 
university, 
Johns 
Hopkins 

University. In my opinion, it 
would be a crime not to at least 
explore the option of doing 
research while attending this 
university. There are a ton of 
ways to start, from applying to 
the 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity Program to just 
emailing professors as I did.

Mirroring the slightly self-

righteous motto of our university, 
you might not immediately be the 
best at research, but you will get 
to work with the best and will 
be given a real chance to help 
lead a project. Research will be a 
new experience for many, but no 
matter what your major is or what 
your career ambitions are, it will 
be helpful in one way or another. 
So in preparation for next fall, or 
even this summer, look into doing 
some research.

I

t was a surreal Saturday. As 
the seconds dwindled down 
in what was a close, low-

scoring and sloppy March Madness 
basketball game, Michigan vs. 
Florida State, the entire bar was 
silent. Each breath began to pulsate 
to the same rhythm, a hypnotic 
mumbled version of “The Victors,” 
as we watched the five sweeping 
flat-screen 
TVs 
with 
ignited 

interest. Then, with the realization 
that we were going to win — “The 
Wolverines are going to the Final 
Four!” — the bar erupted into a chaos 
of chants, screams, hugs, clinks of 
glasses and euphoric happiness.

It was in this moment of 

observing pure joy that I turned my 
gaze back to the screen. I watched 
as these 19 young men celebrated 
in a manner almost identical to us, 
but with a barely visible hesitation. 
They still hadn’t made it: They had 
to worry about the next game, their 
homework due on Monday and 
various other concerns normal 
college students face. Whereas 
we fans would head home for the 
night, the weekend stretching 
before us, they were faced with a 
long, packed schedule.

Before starting college at the 

University of Michigan, I didn’t 
know much about the NCAA. I 
had read a few things about its 
supposed exploitation of players, 
but it wasn’t until I arrived on 
campus that I realized the weight 
of this truth. Before, I had viewed 
student-athletes 
as 
celebrities, 

arrogant and entitled to their full-
ride scholarships, fancy gear and 
free passes in class. Now, I see them 
everywhere, in the flesh — asking for 
double servings in the dining hall, 
studying in the basement of East 
Quad Residence Hall, stopping at a 
tabling event in Angell Hall — and I 
realize that they are real people; real 
college students. They are here both 
to learn and represent our school — 
to further both their education and 
athletic career. The only difference 
between me, a freshman, and 
Jordan Poole, a freshman, is that he 
is part of a department that makes 
up to $158 million in revenue for the 
University— and I am not.

The most profitable college 

sports are men’s basketball and 
football. These sports generate 
huge amounts of revenue for the 

NCAA 
and 
their 
universities 

through ticket sales, merchandise 
and 
television 
viewership. 

According to the NCAA, about 
$821 million is generated through 
television and marketing rights 
from 
the 
Division 
I 
Men’s 

Basketball Tournament and about 
$130 million is generated through 
ticket 
sales 
to 
championship 

events. Moreover, in 2013, CBS and 
TBS split $1 billion in revenue just 
from March Madness. And two 
years ago, the University generated 
more than $97 million for football 
and earned a $60 million profit.

There is no denying that these 

athletic programs make a lot of 
money, so where does it all go? In 
football, there are the reasonable 
investments, 
such 
as 
facility 

maintenance, travel expenses and 
student scholarships, but there 
is also a large amount diverted 
to extravagances, such as flashy 
new jumbo screens or the usage of 
private jets. Coaches also receive 
generous and arguably excessive 
salaries. Jim Harbaugh is known 
as college football’s highest-paid 
coach, with yearly pay of $9 million.

With all the money and deals 

and chaos, the students often get 
pushed aside in the financial battle. 
The industry is so concerned with 
profiting that it exploits their 
players. In exchange for their 
athleticism, 
student-athletes 

receive 
full-ride 
scholarships, 

which includes their tuition, room 
and board. They get to travel and 
play the sport they love. However, 
behind the glamour and seemingly 
righteous 
compensation, 
they 

struggle in even their menial 
needs. In an interview with 
Shabazz Napier, former University 
of Connecticut Huskies basketball 
player, he stated that “some nights I 
go to bed starving.” His sentiments 
have been echoed by many student-
athletes who believe that a full-
ride does not sustain a real college 
lifestyle, one that includes buying 
textbooks, going out to eat or 
attending events.

Critics suggest that student-

athletes, like other busy students, 
should 
be 
grateful 
for 
their 

scholarship 
and 
follow 
the 

standard path of getting a part-time 
job to make that extra money. Yet 
I would argue that their position 

as an athlete for a university 
functions as a job. For example, in 
a 2013 report on Northwestern’s 
football program, it is outlined that 
a player’s “typical training camp 
day entails mandatory meetings, 
film sessions and practices from 
6:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.” Something 
that consumes one’s day cannot 
be labeled as a hobby, especially 
when its results come in the form of 
billions of dollars.

Student-athletes 
also 
lack 

security. As of 2013, universities 
aren’t required to provide health 
care when an athlete is injured, 
which leads to steep medical 
bills, and oftentimes, rescinded 
scholarships. One notable story 
is that of Kyle Hardrick, a former 
University of Oklahoma basketball 
player who now works 12-hour 
shifts in the oil fields near his home 
in Texas. During his freshman year 
of college, he tore his meniscus, 
and after a lethargic reaction by the 
athletic department, the university 
refused to pay for his surgery 
and rehab. However, in hopes of 
playing, Hardrick went through 
with the operation and recovery, 
paying out of his own pocket. Once 
ready and optimistic, his head 
coach Lon Kruger decided that 
“Kyle really don’t belong here” and 
the university rescinded Hardrick’s 
scholarship. It is a disgrace that 
universities 
can 
so 
blatantly 

disrespect and discard such vital 
members of their institution.

There needs to be impactful, 

dynamic bylaw change within 
the association. Student-athletes 
deserve 
better 
compensation, 

in whatever form it may hold. 
The current situation is not 
fair. 
Student-athletes 
provide 

and 
produce 
so 
much 
for 

their universities, and yet the 
NCAA profits in an extremely 
disproportionate manner. With 
the implementation of a work-
study type program, free lifelong 
health care and non-rescindable 
scholarships, 
student-athletes 

will find themselves represented 
and respected, and therefore 
empowered, in performing for the 
school and sport they love.

The Michigan Daily Editorial Board 
commends Schlissel for his proposal, 
and calls on the board to listen to 
the opinions of both students and 
faculty to approve this change. At 
the same time, we commend the 
student activists who made their 
voices heard to get us to this day. It 
is time we acknowledge our own 
history and take the proper steps to 
ensure we honor those who reflect 
the values of our community.

Across 
the 
nation, 
at 

universities like Yale University and 
Georgetown, students have come 
together to address the growing 
issue 
of 
controversial 
building 

names. A name, especially one of a 
prominent university building, has 
a special kind of presence that is 
felt throughout a campus. Recently, 
University students have focused 
their efforts on the C.C. Little Science 
Building and Winchell House in 
West Quad. Little was unremarkable 
as University president with a tenure 
of only four years from 1925 to 1929. 
While he tried to implement various 
university policies, he remains 
infamous for his support of eugenics 
as well as his role in the spread of 
tobacco propaganda in the country. 
Winchell, similarly racist, published 
“Proof of Negro Inferiority” in which 
he tried to explain the “biological 
proof” that African Americans were 
inferior. On a diverse campus, the 
glorification of Little and Winchell, 
inherent in the naming of a building, 
does not support the image of 
inclusivity that the University works 
to purport. 

The proposal to rename the 

building would not have been 
possible without the determination 
of students on campus. The Editorial 
Board would like to commend all of 
the student activists and leaders on 
campus who organized and fought 
to change the name of C.C. Little. 
There have been years of fighting 
from students, determined to correct 
what they saw as a visible display of 
values severely incompatible with 
what our campus hopes to embrace. 
As a University that is trying to fight 
for diversity, equity and inclusion on 
campus, changing the name of the 
C.C. Little building and Winchell 
House is a formidable step in 
promoting inclusivity for students 
on campus. With campus issues like 
these, student voices should be heard 
and heeded as we are the ones who 
interact, both directly and indirectly, 
with buildings on campus. We call 
on the Board of Regents to listen to 
student concerns and understand 
that they have taken the time to go 
through the process to implement 
this change on our campus.

Additionally, 
we 
hope 
the 

University considers the changing 
of the C.C. Little building’s name 
a first step, not a final resolution. 
Oftentimes, building renames and 
other policy changes happen as 
a result of student protests and, 
while the action on this project by 
the University is commendable, we 
hope the administration pays due 
respect to the work of the student 
activists by being proactive and 
work to audit all names of existing 

University buildings. Students have 
already expressed concerns over 
the names of other buildings such 
as Angell Hall. Instead of waiting 
for campus activism, the President’s 
Advisory Committee on University 
History, which assesses building 
rename requests, should apply 
guidelines, such as those used at Yale, 
to show students on campus that 
their concerns are prioritized and 
have a lasting effect on University 
policy. What is most important is 
the inclusion of student perspectives 
in 
administrative 
and 
board 

discussions on how the campus can 
better reflect the values we find most 
important.

Let us be clear: Removing the 

names of despicable individuals in 
our University’s past from buildings 
must not be construed as an erasure 
of their legacies at the University. 
Should the board approve this 
measure, the University must take 
steps to ensure that the legacies of 
C.C. Little and Alexander Winchell 
live on, not atop the honored 
pedestals of named facilities, but in 
the historical record. The University 
should publicly display, whether 
in a plaque or exhibit or another 
medium, that these individuals had 
previously been honored, and that 
it took significant student activism 
for the names to come down. The 
University must never hide its 
history of honoring these individuals 
and the student activism it took to get 
to this change.

A

s undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Michigan, 
the names of places become embedded in our language. For many, 
C.C. Little is the name of a bus station, a location for class or simply 

a landmark to give directions. Underneath our colloquial use of the name, 
however, is the inherent glorification of a man who stood for everything 
University students and administrators oppose. This week, after years of 
protest, discussion and deliberation, University President Mark Schlissel 
has proposed to the University’s Board of Regents to rename the C.C. Little 
Science Building along with Winchell House in West Quad Residence Hall.

“Welcome Back — we missed 
you!” reads a sign written in light 
blue chalk cursive on the wall 
of Blank Slate Creamery, Ann 
Arbor’s 
premier 
sweet-tooth 
hotspot. It is 2:30 p.m. on a sunny, 
yet chilly, Monday afternoon in 
early March, about 26 degrees 
fahrenheit with scattered snow 
showers. 
The 
shop, 
nestled 
on a corner near the heart of 
downtown Ann Arbor, right past 
Main Street, had opened its doors 
for business only 30 minutes 
previously. 
Despite 
the 
cold 
weather and trek from campus, 
as snow falls and the temperature 
drops, the shop is a revolving 
door of happy customers — a mix 
of townies and students alike. All 
of them hovered over the circular 
tables with chalkboard surfaces, 
spooning balsamic strawberry, 
brown butter cookie dough and 
(a personal favorite) wolverine 
tracks flavored ice cream between 
laughs.
On this particular Monday, 
Blank Slate has just reopened for 
the season, having been closed 
for the dead of Michigan winter, 
when most of us can barely get 
out of bed to go outside, let alone 
eat ice cream. I’m an advocate 
for them to open their doors all 
year around, considering the 
midterm 
season 
craving 
for 
some of my favorite scoops calls 
even when it’s 10 below zero (a 
further testament to wolverine 
tracks being the best ice cream 
flavor I’ve ever had). That being 
said, I couldn’t wait to open the 
front door when I arrived to visit 
the shop’s owner, Janice Sigler. 
A few days before my visit, they 
celebrated the fifth anniversary 
of their 2014 opening, which 
Sigler did not anticipate at all.
“We ran out of ice cream in the 
first two days. And people were 
saying it was a marketing ploy! 
But I was so stressed, thinking 
how could I open this place and 
run out of our product before the 
first two days?” she said in an 
interview with The Daily when 
asked to describe that opening 
weekend.
Though stressful at the time, 
this first weekend set up very well 
for what was to come for the shop, 
as it quickly became one of the 
most popular dessert locations in 
Ann Arbor. Marketing ploy or not, 
Janice and her family must’ve 
been doing something right, 
because the minute they had 
enough ice cream to re-open their 
doors the crowds came running.
Sigler is an alum of the 
University, having completed her 
degree in 1991. She went on to 
work with alumni relations for 
about 20 years before deciding 
she wanted to be her own boss. 
In brainstorming ideas of what 
she could do if she left her job 
with alumni relations, she was 
reminded of an old dream of 
hers she had growing up. She 
used to live near an old school 
house she always thought would 
make a great ice cream shop. 
And suddenly, she realized that 
her destiny was to open her own 
shop — one with its own quirky 
personality that would make it 
stand apart from the 80,000 ice 
cream, gelato and frozen yogurt 
shops around the U.S.. When she 
was in her 20s, this ice cream shop 
ambition seemed like it would be 
nothing more than a dream, but 
things have since changed. This is 
a testament to an ongoing theme 
running through the central vein 
of the shop: authenticity and 
going back to your roots.
Sigler’s son Nate showed me 
around the shop’s kitchen while 
he told me about his mother’s 
journey to becoming what I call 
an ice cream engineer — making 
her own unique flavors, all from 
scratch. She began with a little 
cupboard 
ice 
cream 
maker, 
testing out different flavors and 
ingredients 
before 
realizing 
the potential she had in the 
world of ice cream. Some may 
say she bends the rules of the 
conventional ice cream flavor, but 
I say she advances the world of ice 
cream, taking even the diehard 
Breyers french vanilla fans and 
making them go nuts over Fresh 

Basil 
or 
Blueberry 
Pancake. 
Suddenly, everyone is interested 
in 
blackberry-riesling 
sorbet 
paired with a scoop of creamy 
matcha.
After 
the 
initial 
experimentations with the little 
ice cream maker, it was time to 
step it up a notch. Janice was 
trained in Massachusetts by 
Gary of Gary’s ice cream, and 
had mentors from all over the 
country — the dairy programs at 
neighboring Big 10 universities 
especially. She nods to MSU, who, 
despite the rivalry, welcomed her 
warmly and aided her with the 
cooling process. Since then, the 
team at Blank Slate have become 
experts.
Nate showed me how they mix 
in the fresh ingredients for each 
individual flavor, adding garden 
mint or coffee grounds to the mix 
while it’s still hot. Chemically, 
this really infuses the ice cream 
with the specific ingredients, 
making the flavor all the more 
aromatic and heavenly. After 
the ice cream is finished being 
made it goes into a -25 degree 
freezer to harden. The time on 
the process is precise, and when 
the timers go off for various steps 
Nate and the other employees 
drop what they’re doing to attend 
immediately to the product.
“It’s hard to change people’s 
taste and their minds when it 
comes to ice cream and when 
they’re used to artificial flavor,” 
Janice said about their flavors. 
“The mint chip is not bright 
green, and over here I’m making 
fresh blackberry jelly for our 
peanut butter and jelly ice cream. 
It’s not what people are used to, 
but that’s the fun of it.”
I never realized how much 
goes into the process before the 
cone is passed over the white 
countertop into my thankful 
palms — and I certainly gained a 
further appreciation for the trials 
and tribulations of the ice cream 
chemist.
So what’s the secret?
“Well, we go the extra mile,” 
laughs Nate, “and that’s why they 
go the extra mile,” gesturing to 
the filled tables of customers 
who have walked a little less than 
a mile from campus for an ice 
cream cone.
Blank Slate certainly does go 
the extra mile. I was lucky enough 
to get a backstage glance into 
the ice cream making process, 
and learned about the rigorous 
process that goes into the end 
product: a pink cup enclosed 
with rich, creamy hot fudge and 
adorned with a glossy maraschino 
cherry. While most ice cream 
places purchase a mix or perhaps 
just receive large containers of 
their ice cream from a bigger 
corporation, Blank Slate makes 
everything from scratch. This 
means everything from the ice 
cream to the mix-ins, including 
things like cookie dough, caramel, 
fudge and brownie bites. They use 
the freshest fruit for their fruitier 
flavors and the most quality 
ingredients for mix-ins that they 
cannot make from scratch. Their 
dairy provider, Guernsey Dairy 
Farms, in Northville, Mich., 
pasteurizes their product before 
it gets to the store, however, the 
staff must re-pasteurize the dairy 
prior to making the ice cream, 
which is one of the earliest steps 
of the process.
When I was there they were 
making the brown butter cookie 
dough flavor. The eggless cookie 
dough is made from scratch, and 
the dough is swirled into the base.
“I want to try to make it so I 
would like every bite, you know? 
And so everyone doesn’t have to 
be picking out the cookie dough,” 
Nate laughs as he focuses on the 
swirl of the ice cream filling up 
white containers, en route to the 
freezer. 
The 
staff 
has 
a 
certain 
camaraderie 
and 
personality 
to them, which fits Blank Slate 
perfectly. As a family owned 
business, Janice and her son Nate, 
who is the operations manager, 
work closely day in and day out, 
and the value of having a mother-
son duo working together is 
something really special. Janice 
and her husband live on top 
of the shop, both Michigan 
graduates with passionate, warm 

personalities. I had the pleasure 
of meeting both of them in my 
recent visit to Blank Slate — and 
got to talk to them about the 
family values that are the key 
to Blank Slate’s charm. Janice’s 
father did the electrical work of 
the building, and her brother, a 
carpenter helped upon opening 
too. The employees make the 
atmosphere and energy in Blank 
Slate vibrant, hospitable and 
waffle cone scented.
This takes me back to the 
first time I ever had Blank Slate, 
which I consider one of my best 
memories at the University thus 
far. My best friend and I, having 
finished our first exams of college 
in mid-December of our freshman 
year decided to head out to get ice 
cream in celebration of our tests 
being over. We selected Blank 
Slate as the location, despite the 
9:00 p.m. chill in the December 
air. When we were halfway there 
from our dorm room in East 
Quad it began to really snow for 
the first time since we’d arrived 
at Michigan. This was the first 
blizzard of the winter. The snow 
was coming down in huge wet 
flakes, sticking to our hair and 
our hats and our coats. Our first 
instinct was to turn back, but 
we were already halfway into 
the 30-minute walk, and we had 
heard that the ice cream was 
worth it. So we trekked on. Our 
hands were freezing cold, and 
tears — a result of laughing too 
hard, or perhaps the nostalgia of 
growing older — froze like icicles 
on our cheeks. Our noses were 
pink and our eyes bright. Finally, 
after what seemed like an eternity, 
we arrived. The black and white 
sign hung like a cloud in the sky, 
the little grey building like a 
temple or a house of worship. We 
skid down the sloped road toward 
the front door, and collapsed into 
its open embrace, still smiling 
as we proceeded to defrost. I 
think this was the moment that 
I realized what I adore so much 
about this city and its peculiar 
idiosyncrasies everywhere you 
turn, making it so easy to fall in 
love with. Everything in Ann 
Arbor, even the ice cream, is done 
with a degree of love I didn’t 
know existed in any other pocket 
of the Earth. This was my first 
time at Blank Slate. I had the 
white chocolate raspberry flavor, 
with homemade hot fudge, still 
my go-to, and still tastes like 
coming home.
Since then, I’ve brought every 
visitor I’ve ever had to the shop, 
from 
my 
grandparents 
who 
were craving ice cream after the 
spring football game last year 
to my best friend, who visited 
on a snowy Nov. weekend to 
see a performance of a show I 
was working on. Each time is 
better than the last, with new 
memories and flavors. A personal 
favorite moment was when my 
younger 
brother 
decided 
to 
commit to the University class 
of 2022, and we celebrated with 
two ice cream flights and a pile 
of tiny plastic spoons. That’s 
the best way to describe Blank 
Slate: a celebration, even when 
it isn’t called for. Just a spoonful 
of celebration. A spoonful of 
happiness.
After the tour of the ice cream 
laboratory, an array of tasters 
on little paper spoons (matcha 
is incredible, the brown butter 
cookie dough is to die for) and of 
course a warm waffle cone with 
none other than white chocolate 
raspberry, I had to walk out of the 
front door of Blank Slate and back 
into the real world. But luckily, 
I got to do it with a feeling of 
amiability and satisfaction in my 
heart, and an ice cream cone in 
my hand.
One of the most endearing parts 
of the shop to me is the name. It’s 
unconventional, nonetheless with 
sweet individuality that makes it 
more alluring and distinctive.
The name of the shop is a 
testament to the journey from 
Communications major to dairy 
expert, starting anew in pursuit of 
a childhood dream. And isn’t that 
what we all need sometimes? An 
ice cream cone dripping down the 
side of our hand (chocolate fudge 
brownie and madagascar vanilla 
with fresh raspberry sauce), an 
adventure and a fresh start.

In 2015, the Netflix series 
“Narcos” enthralled audiences 
with a retelling of the life and 
business 
of 
Columbian 
drug 
kingpin Pablo Escobar. An instant 
hit, the series was renewed for 
four seasons, the third of which 
premiered this past September to 
critical acclaim. Now, attempting 
to feed off of this success is “The 
Mechanism,” a “Narcos”-esque 
show from the same producer: 
José Padilha.
Departing 
from 
Escobar’s 
Colombian 
cartel, 
“The 
Mechanism” 
takes 
place 
in 
Brazil and is loosely based on 
the investigation of rampant 
bribery and foul-play in the state-
controlled oil industry, known as 
Operação Lava Jato (Operation 
Car Wash). Told through the 
eyes of police officer Marco Ruffo 
(Selton Mello, “The Movie of My 
Life”), the series highlights both 
the personal and professional 
consequences of trying to take 
down corrupt public officials. In 
the first episode alone, Ruffo’s 
family is threatened by the 
money-laundering 
criminal 
Roberto Ibrahim (Enrique Diaz, 
“Rust”). The second episode 
jumps 
10 
years 
ahead, 
the 
case still unsolved, with Ruffo 
struggling to find another job 
because he’s been marked with 
retirement due to mental illness.
With 
the 
narration-based 
storytelling and a crime story 
plotline, the comparisons to 
“Narcos” 
are 
obvious 
and 
unsurprising. What would be 
surprising is if “The Mechanism” 
receives the same praise as its 
predecessor, as quality is not one 
of the things the two shows share. 
Though effective in introducing 
its 
main 
character 
and 
understanding his obsession with 

solving the corruption scandal, 
Ruffo’s voiceover is suffocating 
at points — often using cheesy 
one-liners 
and 
unnecessary 
profanity to tell the story. There 
is a chance for recovery when the 
series continuously shifts focus 
between Ruffo and his badass 
woman mentee, Verena Cardoni 
(Caroline Abras, “Something Like 
That”). Yet without sustaining 
the narration style that the show 
debuted with, some later parts 
and episodes feel disconnected, 
and as a result, the audience 
fails to understand some main 

characters, like Verena, as much 
as they may others.
In fact, most of the issues with 
“The Mechanism” comes from 
its dialogue; not necessarily what 
it contains, but rather how it is 
presented. The show does not 
use subtitles, but instead dubs its 
Spanish and Portuguese-speaking 
actors with English voices. This 
makes for an uncomfortable and 
distracting experience, one that 
could be resolved if the majority 
of American people wouldn’t 
mind understanding their shows 
through subtitles rather than 
relying on less-than-exemplary 
dubbing.
The saving grace of the series 
is its cinematography, which 
showcases the sweeping skylines 
of some of Brazil’s most beautiful 
cities, including São Paulo and 
Brasília. In more poignant shots, 
the severe economic inequality 
of Brazil is depicted through 
contrasting scenes of the lavish 
houses of politicians and the 
sagging huts of a poverty-stricken 
portion of the public.
Yet not even this can redeem 
“The 
Mechanism” 
from 
the 

larger problem of the genre that it 
hails from.
While perhaps entertaining, 
there are dangerous undertones 
to the thread of series and movies 
that use the stereotype that 
Latin America is nothing more 
than a crime-infested drug hub. 
Even the promotional art for 
“Narcos,” a series praised for 
its representation of Escobar’s 
Columbia, turned the entirety of 
South America into a single pile 
of cocaine. From dramas like 
“Narcos” to comedies like “We’re 
the Millers,” Latin Americans 
and their countries are turned to 
nothing more than drug dealers 
or their victims. This phenomena 
just perpetuates an unfavorable 
view of its population that many 
in America are attempting to 
foster.
As important as it is to learn 
about 
and 
understand 
the 
violence and struggle that many 
are facing in Latin American 
communities, there has to be 
better ways to do so. Tacky, 
over-dramatic Netflix shows can 
be fun to watch, but they only 
succeed in making entertainment 
out of the real-life and ongoing 
misery of the citizens they 
address. Instead of relying on an 
eight-part series for global news, 
perhaps we should demand more 
of our media in their depictions 
of ever-vibrant culture of the 
Americas, and not just their 
unfortunate blemishes. Though 
“The Mechanism” may shed light 
on a serious and topical issue that 
those outside of Brazil may not 
know about, it does so in a way 
that is trivializing and artificial. 
True understanding comes from 
resources beyond what is fun 
to watch; and if someone really 
wants to educate themselves on 
the political and socio-economic 
issues of surrounding countries, 
“The Mechanism” is certainly not 
the way to do it.

There are huge venues and 
there are small venues — think 
Little Caesar’s Arena compared 
to St. Andrew’s Hall — and then 
there is Hill Auditorium. Though 
I’ve been inside for academic 
lectures 
and 
student 
group 
performances, I’m ashamed to 
admit that until Saturday, I’d never 
actually been to a concert there. 
Under the auditorium’s sweeping, 
megaphone-like 
arches, 
I 
sat 
silently, waiting for the chatter of 
the audience around me to die 
down.
When Roy Woods sauntered 
onto the stage, I was slightly 
surprised. In my experience, I’ve 
never been to a single concert 
where the set actually started on 
time. From the upraised platform 
that overlooked the hall, Woods 
immediately threw his entire 
being into the stage; I don’t think 
he was still for a single second 
of his nearly hour-long set. His 
energy, magnetic stage presence 
and 
eclectic, 
bouncing 
dance 
moves captivated the crowd. At 

some point, he took his shirt off 
and stared at us silently while the 
auditorium echoed with screams 
for about a minute straight. I’d 
come in with no idea of who Roy 
Woods was, but by the time he 
exited, waving enthusiastically 
back at us, I knew that many people 
felt as if his performance was 
the perfect appetizer to the main 
course — blackbear.
On his tracks, blackbear’s voice 
is smooth, measured and chilled 
out: In the studio recording, 
“Idfc” is resigned yet emotionally 
hard-hitting, 
and 
carries 
an 
undercurrent 
of 
powerful, 
subtle grief. Performed live, the 
song takes on a heavy, intense 
desperation 
that’s 
absolutely 
intoxicating to listen to. With 
the help of some amped up bass 
and tinkly percussion, the same 
melody reached higher highs and 
deeper lows, and all this combined 
with the diffused light from an 
army’s worth of phone flashlights 
made for a very stereotypical (but 
not altogether unpleasant!) loud, 
boisterous 
concert 
experience. 
Besides “Idfc,” blackbear also 
performed some of his most 
popular tracks off of his most 

recent albums, including “4u” 
and “Dirty Laundry” from 2015’s 
Deadroses and “gucci linen” and 
“bright pink timbs” off of last 
year’s cybersex (although I was 
more than a little disappointed he 
didn’t actually play “Deadroses” 
itself). He closed the night with a 
feint by leaving amid a chorus of 
cries and then coming back for one 
last hurrah.
blackbear is undeniably one of 
the most popular artists in the U.S. 
right now. Some love him. Some 
hate him. Some think that his whole 
mega emo, bleeding-heart vibe is 
way overdone. Even though I’ve 
been listening to blackbear in some 
way or another since high school, 
I haven’t really made up my mind 
on his music. In the end, his tracks 
are probably still going to remain 
on my every-once-in-a-while, I’m-
feelin’-kinda-basic 
playlist. 
To 
some extent, I agree that singing 
about love is cliché — people 
have been doing it for thousands 
of years — but at the same time, 
blackbear wouldn’t be popular if 
his lyrics and style weren’t deeply 
relatable to a broader audience, and 
there’s nothing wrong with staying 
relatable.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Wednesday, March 28, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Almost 10 years ago, “Iron 
Man” was met with great 
critical 
and 
commercial 
success. The film ended with 
the now well-known “post-
credits sequence,” in which 
an eyepatch-wearing Samuel 
L. Jackson (“The Hitman’s 
Bodyguard”) 
arrived 
on 
the 
scene 
and 
mentioned 
something called the “Avengers 
Initiative.” The rest is history. 
Ten years and 18 movies later, 
we are now one month away 
from “Avengers: Infinity War,” 
the 
ostensible 
culmination 
of the sprawling superhero 
saga and the capstone to all 
that has come before. I don’t 
particularly care for these 
Marvel movies, but I am 
hopeful about “Infinity War.”
I have long argued in this 
column that ending defines 
meaning. For a story to have 
a point, it has to have an end. 
Without an ending, a story 
isn’t a story at all, but merely 
a continuous series of events 
that goes on and on and on. 
Even the most elementary 
of storytellers could tell you 

that everything has an arc, a 
beginning, middle and end. The 
Marvel Cinematic Universe (or 
MCU), that idea of smashing 
different franchises together 
into one super franchise, in its 

quest to continue expanding 
ad nauseam, has utterly failed 
in its attempts to tell an 
overall story. “Infinity War” is 
its final chance.
In broad strokes, it would 
be easy to say that the MCU 
has told a story. In the films 
leading up to “The Avengers,” 

we saw The Avengers form. 
In “Captain America: Civil 
War,” we saw them fall apart. 
And now, in “Infinity War,” 
we will see them come back 
together 
to 
fight 
Thanos, 
the evil alien who is after 
all of the MacGuffins from 
previous films which, when 
collected, can be combined 
into the ultimate MacGuffin 
that he will use to take over 
the universe. That’s the story. 
But it hasn’t been told. Or at 
least, not told well. Oh sure, 
the events have happened, 
more or less. But the fatal flaw 
of the MCU has long been that 
the idea is much cooler than its 
actual execution.
Almost every single film 
in the series begins with the 
status quo and ends with the 
status quo. A major character 
has never died. Over the course 
of almost 20 movies, we have 
seen the Earth be saved from 
complete destruction almost 
20 times. Never once has any 
of it seemed to mean much 
of anything. The story of a 
team coming together, falling 

‘Infinity War’ & Beyond 

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

IAN HARRIS

“When I was a kid, I 
was always putting models 
together. My bedroom was full 
of hot rods, monster trucks 
and classic cars. Deep inside 
my soul, I am still that kid 
when it comes to building 
these 
vehicles. 
And 
when 
I’m 
immersed 
in 
building 
something from scratch, I am 
no longer in prison. I’m sitting 
in my bedroom, gluing in each 
piece, getting it just right. 
I hope you enjoy checking 
these out as much as I enjoyed 
creating them.”
That is the artist statement 
from Michael Hiltz-Denman, 
whose work appeared in the 
“23rd Annual Exhibition of 
Art by Michigan Prisoners” 
in 
the 
Duderstadt 
Center. 
The exhibit showcases works 
created by people incarcerated 
in Michigan Department of 
Corrections facilities. Curators 
and volunteers visit artists in 
all 28 adult prisons to select 
work for the show. The pieces 
range in media, content and 
level of artistry, making for a 
diverse exhibit.
I don’t often think of the 
incarceration experience, save 
for the few times I drive past 
a corrections facility. Yet it 
was impossible not to consider 
it when looking at all the 
pieces. Some of the art directly 
addressed 
the 
experience, 
portraying the bars and the 
cells. Others, like Monster or 
Victim? by Parrish Collision, 
were clearly meant to make 
us question the conviction 
process. At first glance, the 
piece appears to be a huge 
human eye, drawn in close 
detail. But in the pupil, you 
can see the courtroom and two 
hands in handcuffs. I spent 
a long time wondering about 

the backstory of this artist and 
about the amount of artwork 
I saw that similarly hinted at 
wrongful convictions.
We could also read artists 
statements from those who 
decided to write one. As I 
flipped through the booklet, 
I was struck by the common 
threads — for many of them, 
art is a means to express 
themselves 
or 
remember 
different 
times, 
much 
like 
Hiltz-Denman’s statement. It 
was a surprisingly intimate 
look 
into 
the 
minds 
of 
prisoners, who we may often 
forget or choose not to think 
about because they dredge 
up conflicted feelings about 

the 
horrible 
crimes 
that 
have 
been 
committed 
and 
the way our system handles 
criminal behavior. I found the 
statements to be incredibly 
humanizing and a way for me 
to think about each individual, 
instead of thinking collectively 
of them as prisoners.
The 
exhibit 
also 
made 
me think beyond issues of 
incarceration 
or 
wrongful 
convictions. Artists made a 
variety of statements, whether 
personal, 
environmental 
or social. Spill Ink Not Oil 
by Bradlee M. Patrick is a 
watercolor and acrylic piece 
depicting an ocean in dark 
blue hues. The black that seeps 
into the water stems from a 

massive quill pen’s ink, and the 
colors drip off the canvas onto 
its mounting. This is a piece 
that’s stunning because it’s so 
simple and elegant. It doesn’t 
try hard to tell us what it’s 
about. Instead, its power is in 
the detailing of the feather and 
the droplets spraying off of it.
Another piece I spent a lot 
of time looking at was One 
Forgotten Part by Thomas 
Gordon. It’s a sculpture of a 
robot fashioned out of metal 
parts. One arm holds up a 
circular box with a mechanical 
heart placed inside it. A frame 
at the bottom of the piece 
showcases a poem written by 
the author, discussing how 
he was once a human but was 
changed into a lifeless bot. The 
ending lines hit at the dilemma 
Gordon is portraying: “They 
say I have no emotions and 
can’t feel pain, / Then why do I 
cry from the stress and strain, / 
Do they not realize they missed 
one part. / I still am suffering 
because they forgot my heart.”
It was tough for me to 
look at this work when I was 
wondering about why these 
people were incarcerated. A 
part of me wanted to believe 
these artists had done nothing 
wrong, but a few quick Google 
searches of some of them 
hinted at troubled backgrounds 
and 
serious 
crimes 
like 
sexual misconduct. It was an 
uncomfortable conflict, and I 
wasn’t sure how much empathy 
to feel or not feel, how much I 
was supposed to like the art or 
not like it. Though I want to 
ignore the discomfort, I know 
that I can’t. Instead, I must 
look at this art as a reminder 
that 
these 
incarcerated 
adults are people too, who 
have creativity, emotions and 
passions. And while it may be 
difficult for me to view, their 
art deserves the chance to be 
shared.

apart and having to come back 
together again is a classic one 
and one that should not have 
been that hard to tell. But 
the problem is that the MCU 
has worked almost entirely 
in bullet points, without the 
connective tissue needed for 
such a story to work. At the 
end of the original “Avengers” 
movie from 2012, the heroes 
all go their separate ways after 
fighting one battle together 
and meeting each other. At the 
beginning of 2015’s “Avengers: 
Age of Ultron,” the group is 
now best friends that have 
clearly been working together 
for months or even years. 
Two of them are suddenly in 
a previously never-mentioned 
relationship. Tensions exist 

that were nowhere to be found 
in the original. The Avengers 
are now a family, but we never 
got to see them become one. 
The films elided the part 
where the characters actually 
got to know each other. The 
audience is left to assume 
that there were a bunch of 
adventures off-screen in which 
the characters developed. It 
doesn’t work.
Something similar happened 
with “Civil War.” What on 
paper is the story of our heroes 
disagreeing about whether or 
not superheroes should have 
to be held accountable by 
the government in actuality 
turned out to just be a conflict 
about whether or not Iron 
Man can get over the fact 
that Captain America’s buddy 
Bucky Barnes killed his mom 
(never mind the fact that 
Bucky did it while under mind 
control, because the film never 
seems to care about it). The 

central conflict of hero versus 
hero, of a family torn apart 
by a fundamental political 
disagreement, is sidestepped 
in favor of a story that boils 
down to miscommunication. 
“Civil War” wanted to be the 
dark middle chapter of the 
franchise, the “Empire Strikes 
Back” of the saga so to speak. 
But it misses its chance by 
both undercooking the central 
conflict and leaving its heroes 
in a pretty good place with 
each other at the end. No one 
dies. No one is truly hurt. 
The closest thing we get is 
Don Cheadle’s War Machine 
breaking his legs. He’s up and 
walking again by the end of 
the movie. You want to come 
out of this, a film called “Civil 
War,” feeling that there is no 
way the Avengers will be able 
to handle what is coming to 
them. In the end, you get the 
sense everything will be just 
fine.
And now comes Thanos. 
The big baddie to end all 
big baddies. The thing that 
all of this has been building 
towards. Or has it been? You’ll 
notice Thanos has barely been 
mentioned thus far in this 
article. That’s only one or two 
times fewer than he’s appeared 
in all 18 films. J.K. Rowling 
did a better job building up 
Voldemort as the ultimate 
villain in the pages of her 
first Harry Potter book than 
Marvel has done in 18 feature-
length 
films. 
What 
does 
Thanos want? Where does he 
come from? Who in fact is he? 
If you haven’t read a ton of 
comic books, it’s doubtful that 
you have any idea. Has he had 
any real impact on any of the 
events that have come before? 
If he has, it hasn’t been made 
clear. And if all he wants is to 
take over the universe using a 
magic power MacGuffin, what 
makes him more dangerous 
or more threatening than the 
countless villains we’ve seen 
before who wanted to do the 
exact same thing? In the end, 
despite all of the bluster and 
popular cheer, the Marvel 
Cinematic 
Universe 
has 
operated far too much like a 
comic book, and not enough 
like a film series.
I said at the beginning of 
this piece that I had hope for 
“Infinity War.” I do. I’m not 

naïve enough to think that 
there won’t be more MCU 
films after this. But many of 
the original actor contracts 
expire with this film and it 
seems this is the closest thing 
to an ending we will ever get. 
It’s the series’ final chance 
to prove that it is more than 
just a giant advertisement 
for toys and comic books. It’s 
the final shot for the series 
to decide to actually be about 
something. For it to give the 
characters arcs that last, for 
Tony Stark to finally make the 
ultimate sacrifice, for Captain 
America to decide what it truly 
means to be a symbol, for The 
Hulk to come to grips with 
his affliction, for Hawkeye to 
do something, anything, this 

is the last chance. Stick the 
landing, and you can make 
it all worthwhile. The Ant-
Mans and Doctor Stranges 
and forgettable Thor movies 
and rebooted Spider-Man — it 
can all be made to have lead to 
something great, like how the 
original pre-Avengers movies 
were raised up by the quality 
of what they led to. It isn’t too 
late for the MCU to prove that 
it’s actually telling a story, 
rather than just trying to print 
money. The alternative is that 
“Infinity War” will turn out 
to merely be the lead-in to 
“Avengers: Ultimate War” or 
“Avengers: 
Eternal 
Battle” 
and then we will get three 
more “Iron Mans” and six 
more “Thors” and 17 “Black 
Panther” spin-offs and on 
and on it will go forever and 
ever and ever. On April 27, we 
will have reached “Infinity.” 
Please just for once, let us not 
go beyond.

And now comes 
Thanos. The big 
baddie to end all 
big baddies

On April 27, we 
will have reached 
“Infinity.” Please 
just for once, let us 
not go beyond

Breakdown of the four teams remaining in this season’s Frozen Four

Since the conference’s genesis 

in 2014, no Big Ten hockey team 
has won the national title.

But that fact seems poised to 

change this year, as three of the 
four teams that populate the 
Frozen Four in Saint Paul, Minn. 
hail from the Big Ten.

No. 2 Notre Dame, who 

stands 
as 
the 

lone conference 
champion 
of 

the quartet will 
face off against 
Michigan. With 
a 
5-1 
routing 

of Denver, No. 
4 
Ohio 
State 

is set to battle 
Minnesota-
Duluth 
in 
the 

other 
semifinal 

matchup.

With No. 1 seeds St. Cloud 

State and Cornell eliminated, 
both of the semifinal matchups 
feature 
a 
clear 
David-and-

Goliath complex. The Wolverines 
and Fighting Irish split their two 
regular season series, and the 
Bulldogs fell to Denver in the 
NCHC finals, the same team the 
Buckeyes stomped over in the 
quarterfinal.

The Daily breaks down the 

four teams contending in the 
Frozen Four vying for a National 
Championship:

Minnesota-Duluth (13-11-0 

NCHC, 23-16-3 overall)

Perhaps the most battle-tested 

team with the highest strength of 
schedule in the pack, according 
to the 2017-18 KRACH Rating, 
the Bulldogs could give the 
Buckeyes a run for their money.

With 
a 
23.9-percent 

conversion rate on the power 
play — which stands as the 
paramount of the four — and the 
second-best defense according 
to USCHO, Minnesota-Duluth 
purports a dual-threat front that 
could take advantage of timely 
situations.

Defenseman Scott Perunovich 

— the CHN Rookie of the Year 
— and forward Peter Krieger 
headline the attack with 36 
and 
30 
points, 
respectively. 

Perunovich tallied 15 of those 
points on the power play.

The second-to-last time the 

Bulldogs played in Saint Paul on 
March 16 in the NCHC Frozen 
Faceoff, they were dominated on 
the power play by Denver. But 
with wins over St. Cloud State 
and Air Force in the Tournament, 
they seem to have found the 
answer to the issue that plagued 
them late in the season.

Ohio 
State 

(14-8-2 Big Ten, 
26-9-5 overall)

The Buckeyes 

strolled to the 
Frozen Four with 
victories 
over 

Princeton 
and 

Denver. Arguably 
the 
best 
team 

in the Big Ten, 
Ohio State boasts 
the best defense 

of the group with 2.08 goals 
allowed per game and the best 
penalty kill at 89.29 percent.

But the Buckeyes’ resolute 

defensive line isn’t the tip of the 
iceberg.

Forwards Tanner Laczynski, 

Mason Jobst and Matthew Weis 
combine for 126 total points, 
which easily stands as one of the 
scarier top-lines in the nation. 
And with 60 total goals scored 
in the third period alone this 

season, Ohio State is the outright 
best closing team of the four.

The Buckeyes have notched 

wins over every member of the 
final quartet, save Minnesota-
Duluth, but have also lost to 
Notre Dame four times, the 
most recent being in the Big Ten 
Championship.

Michigan (11-10-3, 22-14-3)
The 
Wolverines 
have 

been 
underdogs 
this 
whole 

tournament. 
With 
tough 

wins 
over 

Northeastern 
and 
Boston, 

Michigan 
has 

proven its ability 
to 
provide 

offensive output 
in dire straits.

And 
with 
a 

middle-of-the-
pack offense and 
defense, the Wolverines’ grit 
has certainly propelled them 
to their first Frozen Four berth 
since 2011, when they lost to 
Minnesota-Duluth in the final.

Forwards 
Cooper 
Marody 

and Tony Calderone are the 
undisputed 
leaders 
of 
the 

offense with 86 total points. The 
junior and senior, respectively, 
combined for three tallies in 
the first two rounds of the 
tournament.

Perhaps Michigan’s greatest 

strength, though, is its newfound 
versatile streamline from the 
crease all the way up to the 
attacking zone.

Sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden 
Lavigne’s 
mental 

fortitude paired with a .910 save 
percentage has been consistent 
and 
reliable. 
And 
freshman 

defenseman Quinn Hughes’ 28 
points, supplemented by junior 

Joseph Cecconi’s 
veteran stalwart 
efforts 
on 
the 

blueline, serve as 
a 
multipurpose 

feeder 
to 
the 

productive 
attacking arm.

While 
the 

Wolverines 
have 
found 

success 
this 

season 
against 

Notre Dame — sweeping them 
in a weekend series when they 
were the top team in the land 
— they have experienced quite 
the opposite against Ohio State. 
The Buckeyes have defeated 
Michigan five times in five 
matchups.

Notre Dame (17-6-1, 27-9-2)
Riding the wave of a victory 

in the Big Ten Tournament 
Championship, 
the 
Fighting 

Irish squeaked by Michigan 

Tech and Providence in their 
Regional matchups.

But with the worst offense of 

the four teams, it’s not surprising 
that Notre Dame is winning by 
close margins. Forwards Jake 
Evans and Andrew Oglevie stand 
as the bannermen, amassing 78 
total points.

Where the Fighting Irish 

make up for their lack of 
offensive prowess is in their 
vigorous defense. Their 2.16 
goals-allowed per game stands 
as the ninth-best in the country 

— behind Ohio State’s 2.08 — and 
their 88.89-percent penalty kill 
prove that they can stop the best.

And 
if 
Notre 
Dame’s 

opponents do find their way past 
the back line, they have Cale 
Morris to worry about. With 
the best save percentage in the 
country at .945, getting anything 
past Morris is a feat.

As the regular and postseason 

Big Ten champion, the Fighting 
Irish are the best team in the 
Frozen Four on paper. Time will 
tell if they can prove it.

Slaker continues to have success in late-game situations for Michigan

One look at Jake Slaker’s 

freshman-year stat line tells you 
everything you need to know 
about the 2016-17 Michigan 
hockey team.

First, the good: Slaker scored 

seven goals and added 14 assists, 
ranking seventh among Big Ten 
freshmen with 21 points and 
hinting at a promising future 
ahead.

The not-so-good? Slaker’s 21 

points led the team. A season 
before, Kyle Connor paced the 
Wolverines with 73.

Slaker put up 21 in something 

else last season — plus-minus. 
Minus 21, to be precise.

Granted, it’s hard to fault 

Slaker directly — he was more 
symptom than cause. Michigan 
scored just 2.62 goals per game 
last season, a drop of over two 
goals from 2015-16, and had 
one of the youngest rosters in 
college hockey; a roster that lost 
seven of its top eight scorers 
from a year before.

But that was last season. This 

season, the Wolverines are in 
the Frozen Four for the first 
time since 2011, and Slaker, 
now an assistant captain, is a 
bellwether for something else 
entirely.

The San Diego, Calif. native 

has been a solid contributor all 
year long. He’s third in goals, 
eighth in assists and fourth in 
total points. But it’s not only 
about what he’s done — it’s about 
whenhe’s done it.

Slaker has shown off a knack 

for clutch goals ever since 
Michigan’s second home game 
against Vermont. On Oct. 21, 
with the Wolverines down 2-1 
a five minutes to play, he fired 
home a wrister to tie the game. 
He lit the lamp again with 54 
seconds 
remaining, 
almost 

single-handedly 
stealing 
a 

victory.

Against 
Ferris 
State 
two 

weeks later, Slaker’s two third-
period goals were the final nail 

in the coffin. In Michigan’s 
biggest game of the season to 
that point against Minnesota, 
his goal in the final stanza sent 
the game to overtime, where 
the Wolverines claimed a 5-4 
victory. When Michigan was left 
for dead, down 4-0 to Bowling 
Green in the opening game of 
the Great Lakes Invitational, 
he scored two straight goals to 
lead a near-comeback effort. 
And it was his empty-netter that 
wrapped up a victory against 
Wisconsin on Mar. 2, all but 
punching the Wolverines’ ticket 
to the NCAA Tournament.

“He’s just a game-time player 

when he gets in big situations,” 
said 
senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone. “He’s moving his 
feet all game. I don’t know, it 
might be a coincidence that he 
scores all of them in the third 
… But he comes up big when we 
need him.”

In fact, out of Slaker’s 15 

goals this season, 10 of them 
have come in the game’s final 20 
minutes. But he couldn’t tell you 
why — in fact, he wasn’t even 
aware of that fact until recently.

“I guess I need to start playing 

better in the first and second 
period,” he deadpanned when 
asked about it after practice 
Tuesday.

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

can’t explain Slaker’s third-
period success either. But he has 
a theory.

“He’s good around the net, and 

he’s got good speed,” Pearson 
said. “And maybe it’s because 
teams break down as the game 
goes on, and he’s able to use that 
speed to get to loose pucks and 
put pressure on people.”

It’s 
a 
pitch-perfect 

description of what happened 
Sunday afternoon in the NCAA 
Tournament Northeast Regional 

final against Boston University. 
With 13 minutes to play and the 
Wolverines locked in a 3-3 tie, 
Slaker was exhausted and near 
the end of a shift. Eyes still on 
the puck, however, he chased 
it 
into 
the 
offensive 
zone, 

bearing down hard on Terrier 
defenseman Brandon Hickey. 
Under pressure to make a quick 
decision, Hickey swung his stick 
and missed the puck entirely, 
and Slaker jumped on the loose 
change.

Just Boston’s Cam Crotty 

stood 
between 
Slaker 
and 

goaltender 
Jake 
Oettinger. 

Slaker tried to swerve around 
Crotty before shooting, but his 
shot hit the defenseman’s right 
knee. 
Regardless, 
the 
puck 

deflected off of Crotty and 
found its intended destination, 
pulling Michigan back into the 
lead. The Terriers wouldn’t 
score again.

Was it somewhat of a lucky 

goal? Perhaps. But it was Slaker’s 
forecheck that put Hickey on his 
heels. It was Slaker skating as 
fast and as hard as anyone, no 
matter how tired.

“His speed and the pressure 

he put on the defenseman to 
make the error and then get the 
puck and make the shot, I think 
that could be some of it because 
he is a good skater,” Pearson 
said. “He’s just as strong in the 
third period as he is in the first.”

That’s the case for his entire 

line, actually. Slaker, junior 
Brendan Warren and freshman 
Josh Norris are three of the 
Wolverines’ strongest skaters 
— Pearson believes that the 
trio skates as well as any in the 
country.

“We’re 
getting 
on 
the 

forecheck early, and it lets us 
play a little bit more on the 
offensive side,” Slaker said. “So 

then when we’re playing the 
defensive side, we can skate 
harder back and catch the guys. 
I think it just plays in our favor 
being faster, just taking pucks to 
the net and just playing as fast 
as we can, pushing the pace for 
the other team.”

Pushing the pace has other 

benefits, 
too. 
Michigan’s 

first two lines are built much 
differently — Calderone, senior 
Dexter Dancs and junior Cooper 
Marody carry much of the 
scoring burden, but aren’t quite 
the elite skaters that Slaker, 
Norris and Warren are. The 
Wolverines’ second line may 
not light the lamp as often, but 
can break teams down with 
the stress they put on opposing 
blueliners, setting up the “DMC” 
line to inflict a mortal wound.

“They add speed, they get 

defensemen 
thinking 
about 

where 
they 
need 
to 
go,” 

Calderone said. “When they’re 
moving their feet and they’re 
going, offensive pressure opens 
up everything for all the other 
lines. So once they’re getting 
pucks deep, hitting guys and 
skating, it’s dangerous.”

You 
can 
chalk 
Slaker’s 

propensity for big-time plays 
up to to pure coincidence, if you 
so choose. That’s probably fine 
with him — he pretty much does 
so himself.

But 
Pearson 
frequently 

mentions 
players 
getting 

rewarded for efforts that usually 
go unseen. That’s been Slaker 
all season — working hard in 
both zones, playing on special 
teams, skating opponents to 
exhaustion. And even when he 
hasn’t directly experienced the 
benefits of his hard work, others 
have.

Sunday, Slaker was rewarded. 

The reward: a game-winning 
goal and a trip to St. Paul.

And going from a minus-21 as 

a freshman to being an assistant 
captain and the third-leading 
scorer on a Frozen Four team?

It’s a bit harder to call that a 

coincidence.

Notebook: Yaklich familiar with Loyola-Chicago

If you had Loyola-Chicago 

in your Final Four, the rest of us 
would like to know about the 2018 
midterm elections, tomorrow’s 
lottery numbers and the date of 
the Game of Thrones season nine 
premiere.

The Ramblers have been the 

darlings of March Madness, as 
they enter San Antonio with all 
the support that comes with being 
an underdog. But the allure of 
Loyola-Chicago rests in that they 
were — and still are, to an extent 
— unknown.

Unless 
you’re 
Michigan 

assistant coach Luke Yaklich.

Prior to joining the Wolverines, 

the defensive maestro went 7-1 
against the Ramblers in his four 
seasons spent at Illinois State as 
an assistant coach and is familiar, 
at least fundamentally, with coach 
Porter Moser’s style of play.

“Coach 
Moser 
is 
an 

unbelievable coach ... you have 
to be locked in on both ends of 
the floor,” Yaklich said. “It’s 

gonna be a dog fight. His teams 
reflect his personality. They’re 
prepared, they get better, tough 
and they have a bunch of really 
great kids that have been through 
the Missouri Valley and non-
conference wars.

“Loyola is obviously gonna 

have 
our 
full 
attention 
all 

week, and we’re 
thrilled with the 
opportunity 
to 

play in the Final 
Four 
against 
a 

really good and 
well-coached 
team.”

Yaklich 
has 

been the architect 
of 
Michigan’s 

top-five 
defense 

that has propelled 
them to the Final Four. His 
expertise 
could 
help 
lead 

the 
Wolverines 
past 
Loyola-

Chicago and into the National 
Championship game.

C.J. Baird becomes a fan 

favorite

Besides 
the 
victories 

themselves, there was a clear-

cut, 
feel-good 
moment 
from 

Michigan’s 
second 
weekend 

matchups — C.J. Baird’s last-
minute 3-pointer in the blowout 
over Texas A&M.

The walk-on freshman had 

scored only once this season — a 
layup — against Alabama A&M on 
Dec. 21.

“It’s the best 

feeling 
of 
my 

life,” Baird said. 
“I told Ibi Watson 
when I got in 
there I’m gonna 
shoot it and he 
said, ‘Okay, do 
it then.’ I was 
kinda 
nervous 

when 
(Jaaron 

Simmons) called 
me because I’m 

like, ‘Oh, they actually want me 
to do this.’ I didn’t think they’d 
actually let me do it.”

The 
nearly 
30-foot 
shot 

catapulted Baird into Twitter 
fame. Besides a couple thousand 
mentions to his name, former 
Cleveland Browns quarterback 
and Texas A&M alum Johnny 

Manziel also tweeted at Baird, 
“Final 
four 
bound 
@baird_

cj#IfYouCantBeatEmJoinEm” 
and promised an appearance in 
San Antonio.

Baird also scored a video 

interview with The Ringer that 
racked up 146,000 views.

While the shot put the walk-on 

in the spotlight, it also brought 
attention to the rest of the scout 
team for their efforts in game 
preparation 
throughout 
the 

season.

Football coaches react to 

Michigan basketball success

There is one thing that the 

football and basketball teams 
clearly have in common: elite 
defense.

On 
Tuesday, 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown spoke 
with the media and talked not only 
about his team’s improvements 
over the offseason, but he also 
marvelled at the basketball team’s 
hard-nosed play.

“They’re doing everything,” 

Brown said. “The point guard, 
(Zavier) 
Simpson? 
He’s 
an 

impressive guy. Boy, I remember 
watching him and l’m like, he’s a 
dude now.

“Let’s get him out there, I’m 

sure coach (Jim Harbaugh) would 
love that. I’m enjoying the ride 
like everybody else.”

Harbaugh also raved about 

how the basketball team and 
his coaching counterpart, John 
Beilein, have ascended to once-
unthinkable ranks.

Unlike 
Brown, 
Harbaugh 

wasn’t reserved about his praise 
for the team.

“They’re beasts,” he said. “I 

don’t think I’m going too far on a 
limb here, I think that the way the 
team played (against Texas A&M), 
they could’ve beat the Los Angeles 
Lakers. ... Guys were attacking 
on both ends of the floor on the 
offensive side and the defensive 
side. So much excitement for 
Coach Beilein and his staff and the 
team. And onward.”

Wolverines sweep their 
home, weekend series 

The 
homecoming 
was 

everything 
the 
Michigan 

women’s tennis team could have 
hoped for.

After 
11 
straight 
away 

matches — including a 5-2 
victory at Minnesota on Friday 
— 
the 
Wolverines 
returned 

to the Varsity Tennis Center 
and secured a 7-0 win against 
Purdue to remain undefeated in 
Big Ten play. 

“It’s been a tough stretch for 

the girls,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “It’s definitely 
good to be home. We played 
really well today too, which was 
a bonus. We’re starting to put it 
together which is nice.”

Added 
sophomore 
Chiara 

Lommer: “It was really nice 
having a home crowd. Having 
everyone behind us was really 
great, 
especially 
after 
that 

doubles point. It was just a really 
good, positive atmosphere and 
we felt really confident being 
back home after the tough away 
conditions.”

Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 

weekend, 
the 
Wolverines 

dominated singles play, winning 
11 of 12 matches. 

No. 1 junior Kate Fahey 

continued 
her 
dominance 

with a 6-4, 6-2 win Friday, and 
rolled Purdue’s Silvio Ambrosio 
6-0, 6-2, on Sunday. Ambrosio 
fought off a match point, but in 
the end, Fahey took advantage 
of Ambrosio’s slice return and 
used the slow-moving ball to 
drill the shot down the line. The 
Boilermaker could barely muster 
a shot back as the return landed 
in the net.

Fahey was the first off the 

court, so all she could do was 
wait and watch her teammates 
pick off each Purdue player one 
by one.

No. 5 senior Mira Ruder-Hook 

followed closely behind with a 
6-2, 6-0 win of her own, and it 
became a race between No. 6 
sophomore Lera Patiuk and No. 3 
Lommer to see who could clinch 
the match for the Wolverines.

Within seconds of each other, 

Patiuk, then Lommer, won their 
matches 
off 
of 
Boilermaker 

errors.

No. 2 junior Brienne Minor 

was the final Michigan point. 
Her first set was a grind, and 
required a tiebreaker. Minor 
jumped out to a 6-1 lead, and 
while Alex Sabe threatened a 
comeback, Minor escaped with 
a 7-5 win in the tiebreaker. 
She took the second set easily, 
breezing to a 6-1 victory.

The Wolverines usually rely 

on singles play to make up for 
their lackluster doubles play. 
Michigan dropped the doubles 
point Friday but won it Sunday, 
leaving much to be desired.

Though shaky doubles play 

isn’t the end-all be-all for the 
Wolverines, but it’s just another 
facet they need to keep working 
on if they hope to stay undefeated 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten, 
especially 

with matches against No. 5 
Northwestern and No. 6 Illinois 
approaching in two weeks.

“We just gained a little bit 

of confidence,” Bernstein said. 
“You start believing in yourself 
and you figure out how to get the 
four points. I think as a group 
that’s what we’re starting to 
figure out and it’s good timing 
because we’re in the Big Ten 
season which is very important.”

Added Lommer: “Since we’ve 

been back in Big Ten season, 
we have a different demeanor. 
Coming in and knowing we’re 
the best and just that first win 
(against Iowa) was like, ‘Yeah, we 
are the best in this conference’ 
and we have just been rolling 
since then because our attitude 
is back and we’re back on top 
where we belong.”

Dwumfour has potential to fill in for Hurst

It doesn’t take much to get Don 

Brown talking about his defense.

On Tuesday, the defensive 

coordinator was asked who, 
of the younger guys on the 
Michigan football team’s roster, 
was competing for playing time 
at linebacker. It sent Brown into 
a four-minute answer, listing 20 
players from all over the defense 
who have impressed him in some 
way this spring.

He lingered longest while 

talking about the Wolverines’ 
defensive line, naming seven 
specific players who stood out 
before giving a caveat.

“I just hope I’m not missing 

anybody up front,” Brown said. 
“Because I really feel very 
strongly that we’ll have seven or 
eight guys there.”

It makes sense, as the defensive 

line was perhaps Michigan’s 
deepest position last season. 
Its only loss this offseason was 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst, 

who graduated.

But the question does remain: 

Who will replace Hurst?

Junior defensive end Rashan 

Gary was much more brief when 
asked who’s stood out in Hurst’s 
absence.

“We’ve got this guy, you know, 

Jersey kid, (junior defensive 
tackle) Michael 
Dwumfour,” 
Gary said. “He’s 
fast off the ball, 
just like (Hurst). 
It’s 
ridiculous. 

But, you know, 
you’re gonna see 
it when the time 
comes.”

Maybe there’s 

some bias, as 
Gary, 
a 
New 

Jersey native himself, admitted 
he’s known Dwumfour since the 
second grade. Still, though, it’s 
high praise from the junior.

In 
fact, 
it’s 
somewhat 

surprising 
considering 
that 

Dwumfour has been a bit of a 
second fiddle in his time being 

recruited and playing for the 
Wolverines.

When he graduated from 

high school, Dwumfour was a 
three-star recruit, according to 
247Sports. In Michigan’s 2016 
recruiting class that had 13 four 
and five-star players, including 
three on the defensive line, 

Dwumfour 
was 

overshadowed. 
That 
isn’t 
an 

automatic 
disqualifier, 
but 
Wolverine 

faithful 
weren’t 

exactly clamoring 
for 
Dwumfour’s 

arrival.

The same could 

be said for his 
time on campus 

too. Dwumfour has played in just 
10 games in his career — nine last 
season — and amassed six career 
tackles. For the past two seasons, 
he’s been mostly an afterthought 
at a position that has yielded 
multiple NFL players in recent 
years.

Hurst’s departure leaves a 

question mark on a defense that 
otherwise has very few. But 
from all accounts, Dwumfour 
has returned this season with 
a new mindset. He’s made 
improvements that have his 
teammates taking notice, and he 
is smack-dab in the middle of the 
conversation for who will take 
Hurst’s spot on the interior of the 
defensive line.

“I’ve seen a guy, you know, 

grow 
up,” 
said 
sophomore 

linebacker Devin Bush. “I’ve seen 
a guy go through ups and downs. 
He was feeling one way, this 
way, and he’s down on himself, 
then he’s up in spirits. I’ve seen 
a guy go through a bunch of 
mixed emotions and, you know, 
when we’re on the field, he’s 
out there working. And you can 
see improvement from him and 
he has taken a huge jump from 
when he first got here.”

Added Brown: “The guy that 

was taking great steps a year ago 
during Bowl prep was (Michael) 
Dwumfour. He hasn’t slowed.”

‘M’ extends win streak, 
then falls to Ohio State

The No. 8 Michigan men’s 

tennis team split the weekend, 
beating Penn State on Saturday, 
5-2, before faltering, 6-1, against 
No. 2 Ohio State on Sunday.

Saturday’s 
match 
started 

with 
inconsistent 
doubles, 

which was nothing new for the 
Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 12-3 
overall). After winning the first 
doubles match, 6-2, Michigan 
couldn’t close out any of the 
other two matches, losing, 6-2 
and 7-6 (4), at second and third 
doubles, respectively.

“We served for (the doubles 

point) 
twice, 
and 
that’s 

happened a lot this year where 
we are just not finishing,” 
said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg. “It’s becoming a little 
bit of a habit where we have it 
in our sights and we’re letting 
it go.”

However, 
the 
Wolverines 

rebounded and hit the ground 
running during the singles 
matches, winning four of the 
six 
matches 
in 
convincing 

fashion while senior Runhao 
Hua grinded out a fifth point in 
three sets at No. 1 singles.

“You want to grab that 

momentum back as soon as you 
can,” Steinberg said. “Davis 
(Crocker) did a great job. Carter 
(Lin) has had a great year and 
finished his opponent pretty 
quickly, but that whole side 
with Alex (Knight), Davis and 
Carter were great yesterday and 
brought us to victory.”

Michigan 
experienced 

another win on Saturday — 
freshman 
Mattias 
Siimar’s 

return from injury. Siimar not 
only won at No. 1 doubles with 
Knight, but also harassed the 
Nittany Lions (1-2, 11-7) at No. 5 
singles, winning 6-1, 6-2.

“Keeping him off the court is 

really tough, but he feels good, 
and (he) needed that,” Steinberg 
said. “He loves to be on the 
court, so I know he was really 
dying to get back out there, and 

it obviously helps our team. We 
need him.”

His return was not enough 

to overcome the Buckeyes (3-0, 
16-2), though. Despite a lopsided 
6-1 defeat, the scoreboard did 
not reflect how close many 
individual matches were, as 
the Wolverines lost two of their 
singles matches in third-set 
tiebreakers on top of losing the 
doubles point, 6-4, 7-5.

“With our team, I think 

everyone feels like we have a 
chance to win at every position, 
which is really good because it 
doesn’t really put extra pressure 
on anybody,” Steinberg said. 
“When you go into Ohio State, 
you’re playing on those front 
courts against the best players.

“It’s a huge challenge, but it’s 

also fun. It’s the atmosphere 
you want to play in front of and 
I think they grow a lot from it.”

The one win on Sunday came 

at No. 4 singles from junior 
Myles Schalet, who was the 
only player to lose against Penn 
State. Playing the No. 42 player 
in the country, Schalet closed 
out a tight three-set match, 7-6 
(1), 4-6, 10-3.

“Today, he handled himself 

well when he was down and 
hung in there,” Steinberg said. 
“(He) was more positive and 
played with real good energy 
even when he was losing, and 
(it) helped him through the 
match. And then his best tennis 
comes out of that.”

With 
conference 
season 

just 
beginning, 
Steinberg 

continues to play with new 
doubles lineups in hopes to 
remedy Michigan’s deficiency 
in that area. But Steinberg also 
looks at the bigger picture. His 
takeaways from the weekend 
are straightforward.

“We just have to get four 

points,” he said. “We don’t have 
to get any more than that. So if 
we can win the doubles and find 
three spots against these top 
teams, then that’s all we need. 
And we are good enough to do 
that against anybody.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 28, 2018

The Machine: 

Inside the CSG race


T

here’s nothing like waking up 
to a blue sky and shining sun. 
Rolling out of bed doesn’t 

seem quite so hard when you know that 
waiting for you is the warm embrace of 
sunshine on your face and the sweet 
taste of finally-seasonally-appropriate 
iced coffee. You get dressed, put on a 
light coat and step outside to meet the 
beautiful day.

But wait — instead of the warm 

sun, you are abruptly confronted by 
an icy wind that stings your skin. It’s 
almost April. Where is the 60-degree 
weather? Why is it still freezing out?

Spring can be beautiful and exciting, 

but in Michigan, spring is a temptress 
who leaves you cold and disappointed.

What in the heck am I supposed to 

wear?

Deciding what to wear in the spring 

is a constant battle. Is it still sweater 
weather? Can I wear short sleeves? 
Often, I will get dressed in a giant 
sweater and scarf and walk out in my 
parka only to find that by midday I am 
sweltering under all of my layers.

Or conversely, I head to class midday 

in a light jacket and T-shirt only to 
be freezing to death on my late-night 
walk home from the library. The only 
way to accommodate for the weather is 
to pull a “Clueless”-style outfit change 
every few hours.

While 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
dress 

appropriately for the weather, there is a 
clear portion of the student population 
who do it completely wrong. Perhaps 
University of Michigan students have 
just evolved to be immune to the cold 

in ways I have not, but somehow as 
soon as it is above 50 degrees, half the 
campus is on the Diag in shorts and 
T-shirts, throwing a Frisbee or sitting 
in a hammock.

I don’t know what’s more blinding: 

The reflection of the sun off the 
remaining snow patches or off the calf 
of a pale white boy in shorts? Do you 
not get cold? It’s really not that warm 
out. This truly seems like Stockholm 
syndrome but for Michigan weather.

That one dude who insists that it’s 

still going to snow again

Why are you like this? Who hurt you? 

Can’t you let people be happy? Spring 
is a time for optimism and sunshine. 
Perhaps you are trying to protect me 
from the devious nature of Michigan 
spring, but please do not remind me 

the one day when I am finally enjoying 
the weather.

Constantly predicting that it will 

snow again is like reminding students 
that finals are just around the corner 
during that one week where there 
aren’t any midterms. It’s the calm 
before the storm, and you’re right that 
the storm is coming, but darn it, let a 
girl relax at least long enough to finish 
an iced coffee.

I’m stressed out of my mind and 

can never enjoy the weather when it 
is good

Speaking 
of 
exams 
and 
stress, 

Michigan spring — the cruel being that 
it is — always seems to know when 
students are busiest and then picks 
those days to be warm. Do you have 
an exam tomorrow? What a perfect 
time to make it sunny and 65 degrees 
so you can watch all the other students 
enjoying themselves from the confines 
of the UGLi!

Aside 
from 
offering 
beautiful 

weather when we cannot enjoy it, 
spring also has other ways to make 
us feel bad about ourselves. In this 
atmosphere where everyone seems 
happy and excited about their summers 
comes a stream of Facebook posts 
announcing summer internships and 
fellowship offers which, even if you 
have a job lined up, can make you feel 
inadequate.

Oh great, Josh, the random dude 

from that club I joined freshman year, 
is working for McKinsey this summer 
and Jessica from high school is at 
Google. Meanwhile, I’m stuck here 
just hoping that someone in D.C. will 
be kind enough to actually pay me for 
my services.

Spring has so much potential for 

beauty and new opportunities. We 
look forward to it every year when 
we trudge our way through the snow. 
Although Michigan winters are so 
dreadful even the most expensive 
Canada Goose jacket can’t keep you 
warm, the only people who really enjoy 
spring are the ones lying to themselves 
about what tank-top weather is.

Critical Questions: What’s a good liberal, 

what’s a good conservative?

F

or those of you who sit back 
and watch as this country gets 
rocked by political turmoil 

and maybe feel a little guilty about 
that, this story’s for you.

In politics today, it seems as if there 

is only one way to be a good liberal 
or a conservative. Or a feminist, 
environmentalist, 
fundamentalist, 

fascist, communist, you name it. If 
you’re a Democrat but you oppose 
abortion, you’re out. If you’re a 
Republican but you support amnesty 
for illegal immigrants, you’re also out. 
This sentiment felt all the more real 
for me the other day — in my case, 
being a good person of color — during 
Central Student Government elections 
here at the University of Michigan.

It was Thursday night, high time 

for each party’s campaign. Reggie 
the Campus Corgi just dropped out 
of the race and students had to look 
for a human candidate to support. A 
few members of the Japan Student 
Association, of which I am part, 
wanted the organization’s executive 
board to endorse the MomentUM 
party for their platform and diverse 
representation, just as a few other 
cultural organizations have done.

Yet I was opposed. Aligning the 

board with a certain party meant 
we were endorsing an organization, 
which I may have been skeptical 
of. Moreover, I wanted to keep JSA 
apolitical. A non-negligible number of 
members and I joined the organization 
to forget about politics and have a 
good time with people who share the 
same background or an interest in 
Japanese culture.

There were certainly valid points 

being made by the members who 
wanted to endorse a party. Perhaps 
we, as an organization that represents 
a certain ethnicity on campus, have 
an obligation to endorse candidates 
and movements that are committed to 
expanding representation for people 
of color on campus. Yet not everyone 
thinks about social justice all day 
every day. Just as there is a right to 
advocate, there is also a right to stay 
silent.

In the end, we compromised and 

allowed individual members (not the 
entire board) to endorse MomentUM 
on JSA’s Facebook page. Yet, I was 
left saddened. Thought civil, over the 
course of the argument, some accused 
me of not caring about people of color 
and not using my privilege to help 
others. Of course, I care about race and 
class and privilege (That’s why I write 
these columns in the first place!). I 

just choose to display it differently, 
and I believe they had just as much a 
right to their own opinions.

To assume that every person in a 

certain ethnic or cultural category 
would 
unconditionally 
support 
a 

given slate of causes is fallacious. 
The reality is that most Americans’ 
political 
preferences 
are 
not 

uniformly attached to any single party 
or ideology. That is why there were 
Rockefeller Republicans and Blue Dog 
Democrats until each party’s base 
began to increasingly apply purity 
tests.

The vitriol many of us encounter 

regarding political issues sometimes 
may be because we are college 
students –– the time during our lives 
when we are perhaps the most radical 
–– but that doesn’t mean it’s a healthy 
way to persuade people.

Take this New York Times story 

about a man who cut himself off from 
all the news in the world after the 
election of Donald Trump and lives 
a solitary existence on a pig farm in 
Ohio. A former corporate executive, 
Erik Hagerman deliberately avoids 
all form of current events –– what he 
calls “The Blockade” –– even going as 
far as asking his relatives and friends 

to not talk about politics and listening 
to white noise at the cafe to avoid 
overhearing political conversation.

Some in the comments section of 

the article criticized Hagerman for 
shirking from his duties as a citizen 
to 
be 
informed 
and 
benefitting 

disproportionately from his white and 
class privilege. These are valid points. 
Women, people of color, as well as 
anyone without the disposable income 
to hire a financial adviser in San 
Francisco to take care of their assets 
cannot enjoy Hagerman’s luxury.

Yet who are we to judge Hagerman? 

Most of us read or watch the news but 
are too powerless and/or lazy to do 
anything about it. There are so many 
of us, upon hearing of some great 
injustice in this world, who would 
rather sit down and watch Netflix 
than go protest or run for office. He 
is the extreme version of those of us 
who may have political views but want 
to stay silent and go on with our lives.

Though 
Hagerman 
may 
have 

isolated himself from society, he does 
contribute something to this world. 
He is currently planning to restore 
land around an abandoned strip mine 
and leave it for future generations to 
enjoy. That is his civic contribution, 

he claims.

This is not to say there is something 

wrong about not doing “enough.” We 
are all students, workers, parents, 
guardians who in the end need to make 
the grade and wait for our paychecks 
to arrive. And even among those of us 
who are active in the political arena, 
there are people who cannot voice 
their personal opinion — think about 
the news reporters at this very paper, 
whose silence is a tool that conveys 
neutrality.

As for me, I am just a columnist 

for my college newspaper. My piece 
is merely an appetizer to the more 
important feature article in The 
Statement. Yet if even one person reads 
this and changes their perspective 
on things, I feel like I’ve fulfilled a 
sufficient amount of my civic duty.

In the end, what matters is not 

whether you’re a good liberal or good 
conservative, or even that you make 
a statement. Rather, for those of us 
that are not the most active, popular 
or outspoken, we should do our best 
to be a good human being and benefit 
others by doing what we do best. For 
Hagerman, 
it’s 
the 
environment. 

For me, it’s writing. What’s your 
contribution?

The Machine: Inside the CSG race

by Tanya Madhani, Contributor

I 
 

remember the outcome of each 
Central 
Student 
Government 

election during my time on the 
University of Michigan cam-

pus clearly. My freshman year, the elec-
tion between Make Michigan’s Cooper 
Charlton and Stephen Halperin, and 
The Team’s Will Royster and Matt Fidel 
ended in a victory for Make Michigan by a 
four-vote margin. Junior year, I saw LSA 
senior Anushka Sarkar and Public Policy 
senior Nadine Jawad’s campaign and 
achievements dismissed by the opposing 
party’s candidates.

Seeing candidates of color lose and 

their platforms dismissed in campus 
elections is not a frequent event, but their 
occurrences, however sparse and minute, 
were frustrating to me nonetheless.

As part of my last semester on campus, 

during yet another CSG election, I found 
myself writing this article with the sim-
ple motivation to learn more about what 
CSG campaigns are actually like, but 
instead I found that frustrations I had 
as a voter were just as apparent among 
those who were in the assembly.

In the interviews I conducted through-

out the month, many raised concerns 
about the tokenization of individuals and 
the shadow of Greek life that loomed over 
platforms from various parties.
“C

SG is treacherous,” Public 
Policy junior Allie Brown, 
senior policy adviser for 

eMpower, said.

To Brown, the perception of CSG as an 

organization that “does nothing,” is fair.

“For a lot of people, it’s more about 

how it’ll look on their resume than what 
they’re doing on campus,” she said.

During the fall semester of 2017, CSG 

proposed a resolution to pay themselves 
in a move that many panned as self-serv-
ing. Earlier this semester, CSG published 
an affordability guide which students 
criticized heavily as out of touch for rec-
ommending students cut back on laundry 
and housekeeping services in order to 
save money. Following the controversy, 
CSG took the guide down, but many stu-
dents hadn’t forgotten about it by the 
time the election for the 2018-2019 school 
year came around.

Unlike Brown, several of the candi-

dates in the CSG race were previously a 
part of the assembly and were part of the 
incumbent president and vice presidents’ 
campaign during winter 2017. 

When I spoke with candidates in 

MomentUM, MVision, eMpower and 
True Blue, each of them acknowledged 
the criticism CSG receives for its sup-
posed ineffectiveness.

“I welcome the criticism when it comes 

to CSG,” LSA junior Arathi Sabada, True 
Blue’s presidential candidate, said, prior 
to the election. “For me, it’s a lot less 
about the position and the title, and more 
about my impact. Being a good leader is 
the ability to empathize with other stu-
dents.”

Sabada’s ties to CSG began in her fresh-

man year when she applied to the orga-
nization on a whim, eventually holding a 
position as chief operating officer during 

University alum David Schafer’s term in 
the 2016-2017 school year.

“CSG can be a taxing organization,” 

she said. “While there was change that 
was happening when I was in it, I was not 
satisfied.”

One of her initiatives was the annual 

demographics report, Sabada said. She 
spearheaded the report after being dis-
satisfied by the representation in the 
organization.
“A

nushka and Nadine are the 
first women of color to ever 
hold the office together and 

nothing can take that away from them,” 
Public Policy junior Daniel Greene, now 
president-elect from MVision, said about 
the candidates that he formerly worked 
for during their campaign.

When I met Greene at Espresso Royale’s 

State Street location, he sat hunched over 
his laptop typing away at another email 
or text or Facebook message from some-
one in his campaign. After I brought up 
how busy he must be, his eyes went wide, 
and he nodded slowly.

“Let me show you my calendar,” he 

said, twisting his laptop toward me. All 
that was visible was a large purple square 
on a bright, white background. “This is 
my schedule for the week.”

When asked if he’s eaten, he gestured 

towards a small plate in front of him, 
which was clean, save two small pastry 
crumbs.

When asked what his impression of CSG 

this past year was, Greene hesitated and 
offered an implicit rebuke of his predeces-
sors: “I’m sick and tired of large promises.”

“Campus is really hurting,” Greene 

said, referencing racist flyers found dur-
ing the winter and fall 2017 semesters. 
“What I want to do is follow up on those 
promises. That’s why I’m running a cam-
paign that’s based on direct experience 
and that’s why I’m willing to get less 
sleep.”

There is virtually no difference in the 

basic stances of each party’s platforms, 
Greene said. What makes his party stand 
out is first-hand, personal knowledge 
of hot-button campaign issues and the 
unique experiences they bring to each 
aspect of their platform.

“No one on our campaign is here to 

check off any boxes,” he said. “We’ve 
picked the people that are the best for 
the job.” 

MVision was the only viable party with 

an all-white executive ticket with both 
being a part of Greek life. Their inclusion 
of Black students in high-level positions 
seemed to stand in contrast with their 

ticket and Greek life roots. Some within 
CSG, as well as voters, said this seemed 
like a case of racial tokenization.

Public Policy junior Gabby McFarland 

was part of MVision in its first few days, 
but resigned two weeks before election 
day for what she said were a variety of 
different reasons, including some of the 
party’s promotional material.

“There’s just a lot of dynamics with-

in the campaign that frustrated me,” 
McFarland said.

This pressure would have been fine 

had she only felt it from individuals out-
side campaign, McFarland said. Howev-
er, that was not the case, as she did not 
feel supported within MVision as well.

“There’s a lot of pressure on me, being 

behind two white candidates, which 
would have been fine,” she said. “When 
I was receiving a lot of negativity on the 
outside of the campaign, and then inter-
nally, I began to lose faith in what we 
were campaigning on. It started to feel 
very disingenuous.” 

McFarland, who is part of the Sexual 

Assault Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter, said she was interested in crafting 
MVision’s sexual assault platform and 
gravitated toward writing those policies, 
but lost faith in the team after facing dis-
agreements with others from the party. 
In particular, the Next Step Program 
that MVision crafted in order to address 
sexual assaults puts immense pressure 
on survivors when it should be doing the 
opposite, she said.

According to MVision’s website, the 

Next Step Program aims to address the 
needs of sexual assault survivors to be 
heard, supported and protected at the 
student organization, SAPAC and admin-
istrative level. This program was heavily 
criticised by an op-ed in The Daily, in par-
ticular for its failure to hold Greek life on 
campus accountable for its role in sexual 
assault and the culture surrounding it.

McFarland tried to combat the policy, 

she said, but MVision went forward and 
incorporated it into their larger platform.

“I’ve been lectured on, ‘Oh, you can’t 

run away from politics,’ but I think when 
politics compromises your core values, 
I think it’s definitely OK to take a step 
back,” she said. “The Next Step Program, 
when they were designing that, I really 
don’t agree with a lot of the policy in 
there … Like I said, it just began to feel 
very disingenuous.”

Another thing that contributed to that 

feeling was MVision’s use of Black celeb-
rities in their social media promotions. 
In off-the-record conversations, mul-

tiple members of opposing campaigns 
expressed the same discomfort.

One photo in particular that made her 

uncomfortable was an image of former 
President Barack Obama and first lady 
Michelle Obama with a caption that stat-
ed, “Only 3 more days until election day … 
Vote MVision.” The image was posted on 
Snapchat by LSA junior Michael Heyward, 
MVision’s co-campaign manager and a 
Black man.

“I think it’s hard because Michael 

and Caitlin ... I’m completely rooting for 
them, but I think it’s hard for them to put 
it in perspective,” McFarland said, refer-
ring to Heyward and LSA junior Caitlin 
Christian, a Black woman and MVision’s 
co-campaign manager. “We’re not the can-
didates. The candidates that are associated 
with these pictures of Black people are two 
white people. I think it’s hard to make that 
connection as a campaign manager.”

Christian 
said 
that 
accusations 
of 

tokenizing against their party were hurtful.

“I definitely think tokenizing has been 

used for our campaign in a lot of situa-
tions,” she said. “People say Michael and 
I are tokens, but that’s really disrespect-
ful because that’s kind of like saying, 
‘You don’t deserve the position you’re in’ 
and that we’re just here because of our 
identities. I don’t think that’s fair.”

As for the use of Black celebrities in 

their promotional material, Christian 
said they were simply using figures in 
pop culture as a fun way to engage with 
students on campus by using individuals 
from media they are interested in.

“(They’re) people that we look up to 

and I’m sure a lot of other people do,” she 
said. “I don’t think it’s fair to say that it’s 
tokenizing celebrities ... Saying that it’s 
because they are Black, again just like 
tokenizing people on our team, it takes 
away from the fact that it’s just an (indi-
vidual) that we look up to.”

Using Black celebrities like Nicki 

Minaj and Kanye West on posters is one 
last attempt to grab voters that MVision 
does not have, according to McFarland, 
from demographics they were unable to 
reach through their messaging.

“I think Izzy and Daniel are very 

aware that they don’t have this empa-
thetic, genuine connection with (vot-
ers of color),” McFarland said. “Putting 
out that propaganda with Black people’s 
faces on them is a last attempt at getting 
those votes.”

EMpower and MomentUM, McFar-

land said, garnered more support from 
students of color and were doing more 
outreach toward those students. She 
said Public Health junior Lloyd Lyons, 
eMpower’s candidate for president, had 
face-to-face meetings with students in 
Good Time Charley’s to speak with them 
about a campus incident where a student 
published a racially charged image on 
Snapchat.

“MomentUM and eMpower are mak-

ing genuine attempts to connect with 
their voters,” McFarland said.

AJ Ashman, an engineering junior and 

MomentUM’s 
presidential 
candidate, 

said both his and his running mate’s 
identities as Black men contribute to 
their campaign naturally being viewed as 
more diverse.

“Most politicians don’t look like Char-

lie and I,” he said. “Most student govern-
ment leaders, I should say, I don’t look 
like Charlie and I.”
T

he night before the Michigan 
Daily CSG debate, Lyons of 
eMpower shuffled through a 

PowerPoint detailing his party’s mis-
sion and campaign. As the meeting 
wrapped up and Lyons opened the room 
for questions, one of his representative 
candidates — who was in Greek life — 
informed the room that his fraternity’s 
president had told his fraternity broth-
ers to “vote for MVision since it’s the 
Greek life party.”

“What are we supposed to say to that?” 

he asked.

“Tell them we’re not just a party for 

Greek life, we’re a party for everyone on 
campus,” Lyons said.

Though members of opposing cam-

paigns casually referred to MVision as 
a “Greek life party,” and the fact that its 
presidential and vice-presidential candi-
dates were both involved in Greek life, 
MVision denied this label.

“I think that we want to be more than 

a Greek life party,” Public Policy senior 
Josh Martin, MVision’s senior policy 
advisor, said. “We obviously want to rep-
resent members of Greek life. They are a 
big part of our campus … They have seri-
ous needs. There’s a lot of problems in 
Greek life that need to be addressed.”

Martin said MVision was a party for 

more than just Greek life on campus and 
that the team was working to push issues 
that will affect all students. Christian 
added to this sentiment.

“I just want to add … A lot of members 

on our core team aren’t involved in Greek 
life,” Christian said.

Christian and Martin sat down togeth-

er for an interview on March 22, the last 
day polls were open. The two of them 
had spent the morning on the Diag, along 
with representatives from MomentUM, 
passing out fliers and encourage passers-
by to vote in the CSG elections.

“That dog though cannot win,” Chris-

tian said as she left the interview. “It’s so 
embarrassing ... We, not just us but also 
the other parties, have been outside cam-
paigning and trying our best to reach out 
to students on campus.”

“That dog,” was Reggie the Campus 

Corgi, a Pembroke Welsh corgi that fre-
quents campus and has over 5,000 friends 
and followers on his Facebook page. The 
week before voting began, students had 
organized a grassroots write-in cam-
paign for their beloved Reggie as both 
a joke and protest vote, catching fire on 
social media and drawing press attention 
from the likes of the Detroit Free Press 
and Buzzfeed.

The Monday before voting began, 

Michael Sola, Reggie’s owner and an Ann 
Arbor resident, jokingly endorsed the 
write-in campaign from Reggie’s Face-
book page. However, after voting had 
been open for 15 hours, students per-
suaded him that his dog was disrupting 
the other candidates and he urged Reg-
gie’s followers to vote for “humans” on 
Facebook.

“As soon as they made me aware of that, 

I realized the thing to do would be to go 
ahead and end the campaign,” Sola said.
O

n election night, Reggie came 
in fourth in the election with 
1,403 votes, while Greene and 

MVision won first place with a plural-
ity of votes, double the number of votes 
earned by runner-up MomentUM.

Nonetheless, a dog had beaten four par-

ties, half of which were led by students 
of color. On March 24, the day results 
from the election were released, Sarkar 
tweeted her disappointment at students 
on campus and those from the press that 
gave Reggie’s campaign coverage.

Business 
sophomore 
Michelle 
Fan, 

aMplify’s director of communications, 
bemused that while it is important to prop-
erly advertise and market candidates, she 
chalks up the election results to students’ 
lack of knowledge about how to vote.

“It’s all focused on names in the cam-

paign,” she said. “I think part of it is, 
also on North Campus, it’s like also very 
largely ignored.”

Fan said students who have most of 

their classes on North Campus may feel 
that CSG policies do not affect and apply 
to them.

“They don’t really care about elections 

necessarily, or because they’ve personal-
ly been ignored, so it’s not like a big point 
for them to take out the effort to do it,” 
she said.

The tendency to vote for candidates 

like Reggie also stems from a mistrust of 

CSG, she and several others who worked 
on campaigns have said.

“I know that there are definitely some 

aspects of CSG that are very problemat-
ic, of course, but I think when it comes 
down to it, there are people who are run-
ning for a reason, and they’re running to 
make a change with CSG, so it’s really 
important to vote for them,” she said. 
“But people just think, like, ‘Oh, noth-
ing’s going to happen.’”

This is a trend that is evident on the 

national scale, Fan said.

“In the Asian-American community, voter 

turnout is really low in the United States,” 
she said. “If you’re ignored constantly, or you 
don’t feel like anything’s going to change, 
you have no motivation to vote.”

True Blue came in third in the CSG 

elections, narrowly beating the dog by 63 
votes. After multiple attempts to reach 
Sabada for a comment on her experience 
during elections, I did not get a response.

As for the accusations of tokenizing 

against MVision, the tendency to use 
individuals for their race and ethnicity as 
a means to reach particular voter bases is 
nothing new, Ashman said.

“They’re not viewed as contribut-

ing members of the assembly ... They’re 
viewed as ‘Oh you’re going to bring me a 
population of votes so that’s why we need 
to engage, that’s why I need to talk to 
you,” Ashman said.

He doesn’t know if there were any mer-

its to the allegations against MVision’s 
marketing and can’t speak to their validi-
ty, but hopes that Greene and Baer rectify 
the situation during their time in office.

“I think we have serious questions 

about how a party that stands accused 
of doing this thing can seriously lead 
and change the culture of CSG that has 
existed for years now that tokenizes stu-
dents of color when they stand accused 
of doing what sounds like essentially the 
same thing,” Ashman said.

Bill Clinton talked to a chair?

W

ithin the first month of 
joining my high school’s 
newspaper, I had made 

it on the wall. Or rather, my idea for 
the Bullseye — Opinion’s spread that 
discussed the hottest trends — had.

“Bill Clinton talked to a chair?” 

was what I had scribbled onto the 
brainstorming sheet.

I 
was 
referencing 
actor 
Clint 

Eastwood’s iconic speech in 2012 when 
he talked to an empty chair as if then-
President Obama were sitting in it, but 
at the time knew nothing about the 
speech’s contents or apparently, who 
said it (I am just now realizing as I 
write this piece that Bill Clinton was, in 
fact, not the one who talked to a chair).

The Opinion editor thought it was 

the funniest thing she had ever seen, 
and so she slapped it up on the wall and 
told me I was hilarious. She was sweet, 
taking the time to talk to me and make 
me feel welcome on staff, which at the 
time was intimidating and very serious.

Our 
newspaper 
was 
recovering 

from a major scandal just a few years 
back when all the editors of the staff 
quit in protest against the school 
administration’s requests for them 
to remove controversial articles and 
give the names of their anonymous 
sources after a series of issues covering 

teenage sex, drug 

use, 
drinking 

and 
more. 

The 
Chicago 

Tribune 
even 

covered 
the 

story and wrote 
an editorial about 

our 
school’s 

administration and its “censorship.”

Because of the scandal, the new 

editors were trying to rebuild the 
newspaper to the Pacemaker-winning 
publication it had once been. They 
were on the high alert, and though the 
principal no longer previewed articles, 
it was a tense time.

My class of staffers was the most 

removed from the scandal, having been 
in middle school when it all happened. 
But we could feel the rigidity of the new 
newspaper, and while we were trying to 
learn AP style and InDesign, we were 
also realizing the extent of the damage 
that had occurred and the tedium of 
rebuilding a newspaper’s reputation.

I had entered the journalism world 

dubious from the start. I took the 
introductory journalism class solely 
because there wasn’t a creative writing 
class offered for freshmen, and I 
wanted to write. It had always been my 
passion, and English had always been 
my favorite subject. Journalism had 
seemed alright, so after freshman year, 
I signed up for the newspaper class, 
thinking it could be a way for me to 
further my interest.

Yet somewhere along the way, I began 

to loathe writing and newspapers. 
There were good times—progressive 
dinners, a trip to San Antonio and 
many inside jokes. But the anxiety and 
self-doubt that came from writing for 
the newspaper were too much. Our 
newspaper was a highly competitive 
place, and as someone who had little 
experience writing articles and the 
inability to differentiate Bill Clinton 
from Clint Eastwood, I began to 
question myself. Why didn’t I get a good 
piece to write? Why am I not allowed 
to write an editorial yet? Why am I not 
writing about something I really want 
to write about?

With each year of high school, the 

politics and competition among staffers 
increased, and we got yet another new 
adviser. I worked tirelessly to improve 
my writing skills because I was used to 
being a standout writer, and I wanted 
to continue to stand out. By the end 

of senior year, I was the 

co-managing 
editor 

of production and 
had finally written 
editorials and a 
front-page article, 
but 
it 
wasn’t 

enough. 
I 
felt 

more 
irritation 

than 
pride 
for 

what 
I 
had 

accomplished, 

and underappreciated by the paper I 
had poured so many hours into. Though 
many people would acknowledge the 
fantastic job we were doing, I fixated 
on all the criticism the paper received 
and the errors we made. So, with a fair 
amount of teen angst, I decided I’d 
never do journalism again after high 
school.

My English classes weren’t much 

better, as they came with the rigor of 
preparing for the AP exam. I had stellar 
English teachers, but they couldn’t 
make up for the rigidly structured AP 
essay requirements we had to meet. 
Though my teachers tried hard to 
inspire us and make us worry less about 
APs and our grades, it still felt like 
writing became “insert quote here” or 
“insert argument here.” Yes, my writing 
improved dramatically, but I resented 
the mechanical nature of our work and 
the pressure I put on myself. If that was 
what majoring in journalism or English 
looked like, then I wanted to do neither.

When I came to the University of 

Michigan, I stayed away from The 
Daily and English classes. I was bitter 
about my history with newspapers, 
and worried college would be worse 
than high school. I knew that secretly, 
I still loved writing, but I hid that 
away, telling myself that people don’t 
really get to write what they truly 
want to write because of grades, 
expectations and other limitations. 
Likewise, pursuing creative writing or 
an English major seemed unrealistic 
for a person like me, who had always 
got caught up in the competition. 
No, I thought I’d be better off doing 
something safer.

Of course, I had to meet the First-

Year Writing Requirement. I believed 
I was signed up for a class on satire, 
but in a stereotypical freshman move, 
I registered for the wrong section. 
Two minutes before class I shakily 
checked the course guide and learned 
I was instead registered for the topic, 
“Who Are You and What Are You Doing 
Here?” I stayed in the class, partly 
because I didn’t know how to switch 
to another one, but also because it was 
too ironically perfect to pass up on. 
Who was I and what was I doing in that 
class?

It was nothing like the other English 

classes I had taken, but I still told 
myself I couldn’t see English as my 
future major. I took a communications 
class, and then a creative writing class 
sophomore year thinking I would apply 
for the Organizational Studies major 
and maybe pursue the Creative Writing 

minor since it was far enough removed 
from pure English.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about 

English. 
Second 
semester, 
I 
took 

English 298 on the tiniest off-chance 
that I would like it and awaited the 
decision from Organizational Studies. 
I ended up obsessively reading and 
re-reading James Baldwin’s “Sonny’s 
Blues” and revering over my professor’s 
eloquent and emotional speeches in 
class. Though he had taught many of 
the texts at least six times, he spoke 
like it was the first time he had ever 
encountered them, and I was enamored. 
A few weeks before the Organizational 
Studies decisions were to be announced, 
I found myself daydreaming in English, 
thinking that maybe in that gloomy, 
windowless room in the basement of 
Angell Hall, I had finally found the 
place I was supposed to be all along.

One rejection from Organizational 

Studies later and I was back where I 
started so many years ago — with an 
unthinkably tremendous love for words 
on a page.

Finally, I declared English, joined 

Daily Arts and later got another writing 
job.

One night after dinner last semester, 

my roommate carefully cut up an 
orange and put the slices in one of 
our multi-colored plastic bowls while 
I washed my dishes. I was hit with a 
pang of familiarity; my dad eats an 
orange every day after dinner, peeling it 
with precision while my mom does the 
dishes, and my sister and I lean against 
the counter, talking to them.

It felt slightly odd to watch her do 

something I had seen for my entire 
life, but it also felt comforting — like I 
was returning home, like nothing had 
changed. No matter what or where 
I was, nobody could take away the 
soothing sensation of the experience. 
I’ve since recognized it’s the same 
feeling I get every time I open up a 
new Word document and start writing 
again.

I’d be nowhere without my long-

winded path to my major and rekindled 
passion for journalism and creative 
writing. Likewise, I’m grateful for 
the 
teachers, 
professors, 
students 

and friends who have influenced me 
— whether positively or negatively — 
and of course, for my family and their 
constant encouragement. It’s all taught 
me to push past the self-doubt because 
I’m incredibly lucky to do what I’ve 
always loved.

And no, in case you missed it earlier, 

Bill Clinton did not talk to a chair.

M

y nani stands over the 
griddle, slight beads of 
perspiration forming over 

her brow from the heat of the stove. 
She leans in to smell the egg chutney, 
a classic south Indian dish, and 
wrinkles her nose. Adding chopped 
coriander to the concoction, she 
sniffs again.

“Much better. You want it to have 

flavor, you know?” she said, dropping 
her rs and shortening her yous, 
a consequence of having a semi-
British, semi-Indian accent. After 
immigrating to England 46 years ago, 
my grandma uses cooking as a way to 
connect to the culture and people she 
left behind. This mindset has been 
passed down to my mom, and now to 
my siblings and me.

Food is a big deal in my family. 

Each member of my family knows 
how to cook, whether it is chocolate 
nachos 
made 
by 
my 
9-year-old 

brother or tandoori chicken made by 
my dad. Sunday dinners consisted of 
“cook off” competitions between my 
parents until they got too intense 
and we had to cancel them to spare 
hurting parent’s feelings. Cooking 
carried too much weight for either 
parent to simply dismiss the results 
as part of a silly competition.

Every so often, my mom will 

attempt to cook egg chutney. She uses 
the same recipe as my nani, except 
her dish always tastes different. 
Instead of having the herby, rich feel 
that is indicative of the East, hers 
tastes lighter, healthier and plainer — 
more within the confines of the West. 
Here, the influences of her British 
upbringing surface. Cooking seems 
to be a place where people can assert 
their individuality.

Yet at the same time, cooking is 

a familial, communal experience. 
On weekends, my entire family will 
gather in our kitchen as my mom 
and dad cook. We are never told to; 
the kitchen just always seems to 
exude warmth and inviting tones. 
The 
tempting 
smells 
don’t 
hurt 

either. When I was little, as I hovered 
behind her in the kitchen, my mom 
would tell me the names of the spices 
she poured into the pot: tamarind, 
chili powder, cumin and coriander. 
I would recite the words back to her, 
absorbing each syllable, each sound 
as it rolled across my tongue. Despite 
only having traveled to India once, 
these words taught me of the East.

Growing up as a second-generation 

American, I’ve found that much of 
the “old” culture has been lost in 
translation. I’m not fluent in the 
language of my grandparents and I 

only dress in traditional Indian attire 
two or three times a year. However, 
through food, I have found a link 
to my culture. Food has satiated my 
appetite for language, culture and 
community.

When I finally learned how to cook, 

it wasn’t through formal instruction. 
I watched my parents sauté onions, 
marinate chicken and sear fish — 
picking up tips and tricks along 
the way. After setting many dishes 
on fire and cooking food drowned 
in oil and/or deficient in flavor, I 
finally invented my own dish: an 
egg sandwich. It was a variation 
of something my dad had whipped 
up one lazy Sunday afternoon, but 

included my own twist. I toast and 
butter an English muffin, scramble an 
egg, add Havarti cheese to the muffin 
and then combine all the components 
into my own little homemade brunch.

The process is time-consuming — 

it takes much longer to make an egg 
sandwich than it does to pour a bowl 
of cereal. However, there is nothing 
like hunching over a frying pan in the 
morning while listening to the eggs 
sizzle and feeling the sun shine on 
your skin through the window in the 
kitchen. On slow weekends and lazy 
summer days, those rare days when 
my family wears pajamas until 1:00 
p.m., I might fight clutter, my siblings 
and my parents for counter space to 

assemble my creation, but it is those 
days that I miss most now that I am 
away at college.

It took me a long time to realize I 

cook my eggs in the same style that my 
mom and nani cook their egg chutney, 
albeit a little more oily and flavored 
only with half a pinch of salt. My egg 
sandwich was an adaptation of what 
my family has cooked for generations, 
and I subconsciously included it in 
my own “unique” recipe. It is never 
possible to fully lose touch with 
one’s culture, even if it is because of 
something as fundamental as food. 
In a world where assimilation is the 
norm, food connects me to my roots.

What do reflection rooms 

mean to you?

“A reflection room, for my purposes, 

is somewhere I can sort of retreat 

to. There’s like so many things 
that happen during the day and 
you can get really caught up in 

school, schedules, meetings, and 

sometimes at the end of the day you 

think I haven’t really been intimite 
or in communication with my God. 
The reflection rooms, having them 

around campus and scattered 

around campus, it just makes it 

so much more convenient and it’s 
a reminder to take the time to be 

mindful and in communication with 

my God.”

Public Health freshman Maica Mori, in the 

Haven Hall reflection room
