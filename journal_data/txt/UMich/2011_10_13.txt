LOCAL BUSINESSES
Publishers
try to recover
from closure of
Borders Inc.

Local publisher:
Closing was a
'wake-up call' to
the book industry
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
The closure of Borders last
month left physical and figura-
tive holes across the country.
The company's closing not
only led to 399
store vacancies
nationwide, but
it also put a large j
financial burden 0
on the publish- ,
ing industry.
Several pub-
lishing companies in the region
have experienced the effects of
the bookstore chain's closure
on the industry and individual
businesses. Despite losing one
of their main customers, the
publishers are confident they'll
bounce back from the loss.
David Swan, sales director at
Chelsea, Mich.-based publishing
company Sleeping Bear Press,
said while it is too earlyto deter-
mine the publisher's monetary
losses due to Borders closing, the
publishing industry has lost a

significant number of dedicated
workers.
"Borders had some really fine
booksellers and book advocates,"
Swan said. "Losing them and
knowing that the market is tight
for places for them to find work is
a great loss to the culture - the
book culture."
The once-flourishing book
chain announced its liquida-
tion on July 18 and subsequently
closed its flagship location at 612
East Liberty St. on Sept. 9.
Though the Borders closure
has put a dent in the industry,
Swan said Sleeping Bear Press
has long had strong relationships
with independent bookstores
and hopes former Borders cus-
tomers will continue to buy their
books through alternative sell-
ers.
"It's heartening to see that a
number of independent book-
stores have opened since Borders
has closed its doors," Swan said,
specifically referring to a group
of Borders employees in Cali-
fornia who bought their former
place of employment and are in
the process of openingtheir own
bookstore.
When asked whether he
thinks independent bookstores
will thrive in a post-Borders
market, Swan said he has confi-

Student entrepreneurs look-

have to look further than The
Offices at Liberty Square - the
new home of the TechArb Stu-
dent Startup Accelerator.
After moving into the larg-

take on about 20 student busi-
ness teams in addition to the
several returning groups. In
addition to increasing the num-
ber of students, the accelerator is

"This year, we willbe bringing

UN1VERSITY RESEARCH
'U' researchers identify molecule that
causes rapid movement of cancer cells

Initiative part of

By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
On any given day, dining hall
trays are piled high with pizza,
macaroni and cheese, salad,
soda, cereal, softserve and choc-

olate chip cookies. But much of
this food often ends up in the
trash.
To combat this waste prob-
lem, the University is making a
push for trayless dining in cam-
pus residence halls. The initia-
tive - that started as a trial in
East Quad Dining Hall last year
- has been implemented in the
Betsy Barbour Dining Hall, will
soon be in place at Twigs Dining
Hall at Oxford Housing and will

officially be part of East Quad
Residence Hall dining in fall
2013.
The efforts are part of the
University's 14-year plan for a
greener campus, which Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Cole-
man announced on Sept. 27. All
future dining halls being built or
remodeled will incorporate the
trayless dining concept.

Cancer Center
awarded $3.5M to
study stem cells
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
More than 40,000 Americans
are projected to die of breast
cancer this year, but researchers

at the University's Comprehen-
sive Cancer Center are working
on ways to decrease this num-
ber.
Sofia Merajver, professor
of internal medicine and epi-
demiology and director of the
University's Center for Global
Health, was the lead research-
er of a study that identified
the molecule that causes rapid
movement of a cancer cell and

the importance of disrupting
the molecule to fight cancerous
ce emoe. l
The molecule, called
p38-gamma, controls the struc-
ture of the cytoskeleton of the
cell and ultimately influences
how the cell moves. A cancer
cell's cytoskeleton is typically
arranged in bundles of fibers
that make the cell move quickly.

Investigating education

Why are you inter-
ested in education?
I have been dedicated
to teaching and the field
of education my entire
career. After college,
I worked at the Coali-
tion for the Homeless in
New York where I met
and worked with many
wonderful children and
families who were living
in extreme poverty and
had little access to stable,
much less, exceptional
schools. From that point,
I've worked in schooling,
teaching and learning in
one form or another, with
a key focus on access,
excellence and equity.

What do you teach at
the University of Mich-
igan?
I teach both under-
graduate and master's
students at Michigan.
Right now, I'm teach-
ing ED118: Schooling in
a Multicultural Society.
Although it's a large class,
we treat it like a seminar,
with lots of student inves-
tigation and discussion.
We use many different
kinds of texts to address
three main questions:
What are the purposes
of schooling in the U.S.?
How do schools work?
And what is involved in
improving schools?

What do you enjoy
doing in your spare
time?
I love to cook, do yoga,
play with my kids, listen
to them play guitar ... and
read!
What is your favorite
dish to cook?
Ilived in Thailand with
my husband - I taught at
a Teachers College there
- so my favorite food to
cook is Thai food. I loved
eating Thai food for an
entire year and half. I
especially enjoyed start-
ing my day with a bowl of
hot steaming noodle soup
in an outdoor cafeteria
with my students.

What is the best part
about being a professor
at the University of z
Michigan?x
I am so fascinated by
the way that my students
make sense of our work
together, and I've been
inspired by their creativ-
ity. At the close of every
semester, I always feel
so sad that my time with
my students is over, but
every new semester, I'm r
greeted by more incredi-
ble students. It's an honor
and a privilege to work
with such thoughtful
learners. COURTESY OF SIMONA GOLDIN
Simona Goldin, a lecturer in the School of Educa-
- CECE ZHOU tion, once taught in Thailand.

al-Saadi Gadhafi, son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, watches a military exercise by the elite military unit
commanded by his brother, Khamis, in Zlitan, which is 90 miles southeast oflTripoli, Sunday, Sept. 25, 2011.
Libyan official: Gadhafi
son's capture unconfirmed

Visit an Mcard office soon:

Pre-emptive
reports of son's
seizure prompts
celebration
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - A
Libyan spokesman said yester-
day that revolutionary forces
have captured some fighters
close to one of Moammar Gad-
hafi's sons in the fugitive lead-
er's hometown but that he has
no information that the son
himself has been seized.
Jalal el-Gallal, a spokes-
man for the National Transi-
tional Council in the eastern
city of Benghazi, said his office
has called commanders in the
besieged city of Sirte and "so
far as we are concerned there is
no confirmation that Mutassim
Gadhafi has been captured."
He was commenting on
reports that the son had been
seized, which prompted heavy
celebratory gunfire in Tripoli
and the eastern city of Beng-
hazi.
Anti-Gadhafi fighters have
been closing in on armed sup-
porters of the fugitive leader in

Sirte, the most important of two
major cities yet to be cleared of
loyalists more than two months
after the fall of Tripoli. Libyan
officials have said they believe
Mutassim Gadhafi and other
high-level former regime fig-
ures are hiding in Sirte and that
is the reason for the fierce resis-
tance.
Mutassim was Libya's nation-
al security adviser and had
a strong role in the military
and security forces under his
father's regime.
Libya's de facto leader,
Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, said ear-
lier yesterday he expected to
declare total victory in less than
a week, which would pave the
way for a new interim govern-
ment to be named to guide the
oil-rich North African nation to
elections within eight months.
"I hope that liberation will
be declared in less than a week,
after we free Sirte, and within
less than a month we will form
a transitional government and
the youth and women will have
a role in that," Abdul-Jalil said
at a joint news conference with
visiting Tunisian Prime Minis-
ter Caid Essebsi in Benghazi.
Gadhafi is still on the run

and his supporters also hold the
desert enclave of Bani Walid.
But the transitional leadership
says Sirte's capture will give
them full control of the coun-
try's ports and harbors, allow-
ing them to move forward with
efforts to restore normalcy and
establish a democracy.
The International Commit-
tee of the Red Cross warned
that thousands of civilians were
still trapped inside Sirte with-
out sufficient food, clean water
and other basic necessities. Red
Cross staff evacuated 25 war-
wounded and other patients,
including a newborn baby in its
incubator, from the main Ibn
Sina hospital in the coastal city
on Monday and Tuesday. Few
doctors or nurses remained, the
Red Cross said in a statement.
"The situation inside the
hospital is very chaotic and dis-
tressing," the ICRC's Patrick
Schwaerzler said. "When we
arrived there, we found patients
with severe burns and shrapnel
wounds. Some had sustained
recent amputations. A few were
half-conscious. They were lying
among crowds of other people
who were also asking us for
help."

In this Aug, 11, 2011 photo, a participant in the weekly NOLA Social Ride, prepares to ride to a local pub. Since 2007, the
city has used about $100 million in federal rebuilding dollars tolay 56 miles of new asphalt on 55 heavily used streets.
Post-storm New Orleans
makes room for cyclists

City has 40 miles
of bike-friendly
pathways
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - For
decades, blogger Joseph Don-
nelly saw few improvements
for urban cyclists like himself
in New Orleans, so he used the
title of a website he started
five years ago as a call to arms:
"How To Start A Revolution In
An Unfriendly Bike City."
But a push by the city to use
Hurricane Katrina recovery
money to make the roads more
accommodating has left him
with little choice but to scrap
the label in favor of something
more prosaic. The top of the
blog now reads: "Bicycling New
Orleans: Practical Survival Tips
for Cyclists in NOLA."
"A lot of my gripes have been
resolved," said Donnelly, who
started cycling in the 1970s and
ditched his last car for good in
1989. "When I started the blog
in 2006, there was not a single
bicycle lane anywhere in New
Orleans. Before Katrina, the
roads were dangerous for every-
one."

Since 2007, the city has used
about $100 million in federal
rebuilding dollars to lay 56 miles
of new asphalt on 55 heavily
used streets, transforming pot-
holed boulevards into smooth
blacktops ideal for bike riding.
Under the city's Submerged
Roads Program, bike lanes have
also been painted on 15 streets,
giving the city about 40 miles of
bike-friendly pathway. There are
plans to pave 26 more streets.
The city is also poised to
spend $7 million in federal aid
to turn a wide 3-mile stretch
of an abandoned railroad ease-
ment between the French
Quarter and City Park into a
greenway that will be known as
the Lafitte Corridor.
Ridership has also grown. In
2010, New Orleans ranked 12th
in the number of bicycle com-
muters among American cities,
an 84 percent increase in bike
commuters since 2005, accord-
ing to the latest Census data.
New Orleans-based urban
planner Robert Tannen said an
increase in cycling has many
benefits. "It slows down traf-
fic. People are more cautious. It
makes for a far more pedestri-
an-friendly city; bikers are also

walkers. And it increases the
health and overall well-being
of citizens," Tannen said. "It
increases the number of people
who patronize local stores and
smaller shops rather than the
malls."
The progress has bike enthu-
siasts dreaming: Can New
Orleans, with its flat terrain,
warm weather and tightly-
knit neighborhoods, rival the
nation's best cycling cities like
Seattle, Portland, Ore., and
Boulder, Colo.? This summer
New Orleans was named a
"bicycle friendly community"
by the League of American
Bicyclists, but it still has further
to go to attain the league's top-
tier "platinum" status.
By comparison, Portland has
180 miles of bike lanes. Nearly 6
percent of workers there com-
mute to work, according to the
league's database, compared to
about 2 percent of commuters in
New Orleans.
Still, the city has come a long
way. Bicycle shop mechanic and
bike activist Tim Eskew said
groups plodded along for years
in obscurity and tried to drum
up interest in cycling mostly
through schools.

larger community of student
entrepreneurs, and not just the
ones that are officially tenants of
TechArb," he said. "The previous
space was functional but didn't
have enough room for any event
that was bigger than a few dozen
people."
In addition to TechArb's week-
ly advisory sessions, Kirsch said
the accelerator holds monthly
board meetings to update staff
members on the progress of each
business team and challenges
each group faces. TechArb also
facilitates networking opportu-
nities for students to help them
further their businesses, accord-
ing to Lee.
"This upcoming year, we are
goingto do more to catalyze com-
munity, engage more mentors
from the area and connect stu-
dent teams to funding opportu-
nities," Lee wrote. "Our hope is
that TechArb becomes the best
in class student incubator in the
world. We have already seen sev-
eral student teams receive ven-
ture capital funding or get bought
out."

RESEARCH

But the researchers discovered
that deactivation of the p38-
gamma molecule causes the
fibers to be arranged like a bas-
ket weave, which interrupts the
cell's movement.
"What we were able to find
is that the motion of the cell
changed very drastically from
being very fast, directed motion
to being more like fluctuating
back and forth without moving
very great distances," Merajver
said. "The cells looked a little
more like fried eggs or empana-
das just sitting around versus the
elongated cells that move large
distances, which is the usual way
aggressive cancer cells are."
Merajver said the study is
unique in that it provides under-
standing of the molecular basis
for cell movement and identi-
fies a target molecule that plays
a specific role. She added that
the discoveries could lead to the
development of new drugs to
fight and prevent breast cancer
by targeting cell motion.

"Hopefully we will be able
to develop drugs against it,"
Merajver said. "Whether it will
be us here at the University of
Michigan doing that or not, that
remains to be seen - we'll see
what the future holds."
The research also shows that
analyzing live cells could be an
effective way to monitor patients
undergoing therapy. This would
be done by obtaining cells from
a patient and looking at them
under a microscope while the
cells are still alive, Merajver
said. She added that live-cell
monitoring is not widely used,
but the study's findings suggest
it would be a useful addition to
certain cancer treatments.
"It could help to know if the
therapy is working," Merajver
said. "One of the biggest prob-
lems in cancer is people may not
be respondent to therapy, but
that doesn't mean that you know
exactly where the cancer is. So
we need to know indirectly some-
times if the cancer is being killed
or not, or if it's respondingor not."
According to Merajver, the
Breast Cancer Research Foun-
dation and the Avon Foundation
have provided more than $2 mil-
lion in funding for her team's
work over the last few years. She
added that Breast Cancer Aware-

and reaped many benefits from
working with TechArb is Giant
Eel Productions, a company that
works on innovations for 3-D
media. University alum Edmund
Zagorin, a Giant Eel executive
producer, wrote in an e-mail
interview that TechArb's close-
knit community of businesses
inspired the company to take the
risk of starting a business and
helped him and his colleagues
avoid certain mistakes.
"One of our first video produc-
tion clients was a TechArb com-
pany and provided us an amazing
experience to gain feedback and
build relationships," Zagorin
wrote.
Benjamin Blackmer also said
TechArb's constant support
helped develop his team's com-
pany, called "Are You a Human?"
The business gives websites a
new way to verify that users are
actual people, and not robots. The
company's option is an alterna-
tive to a program that generates
distorted words that users must
translate.
TechArb isn't looking for one
specific start-up to join the accel-
erator, but a diverse group of stu-
dents with a range of different
business ideas and companies in a
variety of stages, Kirsch said.
"It's an environment where
students can learn from each
other as well as from the whims
and learning moments the other
teams experience as well," he
said.
Among the qualities TechArb
looks for in its applicants are a
drive to succeed and a willing-
ness to be coached, according to
Lee. Zagorin echoed the impor-
tance of havingthese qualities.
"If you want to apply to
TechArb, be honest about how
much time and energy you have
to commit to your vision," Zago-
rin wrote.
He added that TechArb is
"good at helping people with nei-
ther a business or engineering
background."
"So don't be scared off if your
company idea doesn't fit the pro-
file of a high-tech start-up," he
wrote.
ness Month plays an important
role in furthering research to
prevent the disease.
"Most of us feel that hav-
ing this focus on breast can-
cer worldwide in October is
extremely helpful to channel a
lot of energy and funding to con-
quer breast cancer, because it's a
very complex disease that isn't
going to be a single solution,"
Merajver said. "Breast Cancer
Awareness Month puts scien-
tists in touch with a lot a breast
cancer survivors and advocacy
groups, and they work together
for one cause: to cure and pre-
vent breast cancer."
Researchers at the Univer-
sity's Comprehensive Cancer
Center were also awarded a
$3.5 million grant from Susan
G. Komen for the Cure in Sep-
tember to study cancerous stem
cells and to develop and test new
treatments for triple negative
breast cancer - an aggressive
form of the disease that dispro-
portionately affects African-
American women.
Max Wicha, the director of
the Comprehensive Cancer Cen-

ter and the principal investigator
of the study, said research in this
area will involve a collaboration
between the Karmanos Can-
cer Institute in Detroit, the Van
Andel Institute in Grand Rapids,
Mich. and the Henry Ford Hos-
pital. Since the centers are geo-
graphically diverse, treatments
will be available to patients
across the state, Wicha said.
After studying the differences
in stem cells in the first phase of
research, Wicha said he and the
other researchers plan to devel-
op medicine that can specifically
target cancerous stem cells and
develop therapies for triple nega-
tive breast cancer.
Wicha has previously stud-
ied why some cancers are more
aggressive than others, and his
research team has determined
that the aggressiveness of the
cancer depends on the amount of
cancerous stemcells. Preliminary
studies have shown that African-
American women have more can-
cerous stem cells when they get
breast cancer, while Caucasian
women have the lowest percent-
age of stem cells when they have
the disease, according Wicha.
"We really need to develop
new therapies that are specific
for this form of breast cancer and
can offer women with this breast
cancer a new hope," Wicha said.

N igerian man pleads guilty
in underwear bomb attack

Man receives
life sentence for
Detroit plane plot
DETROIT (AP) - A Nigerian
man pleaded guilty yesterday to
trying to bring down a jetliner
with a bomb in his underwear,
defiantly telling a federal judge
that he acted in retaliation for
the killing of Muslims world-
wide and referring to the failed
explosive as a"blessed weapon."
Umar Farouk Abdulmutal-
lab, who acknowledged working
for al-Qaida and never denied
the allegations, entered the plea
against his attorney's advice on
the second day of his trial. He
stands to get a mandatory life
sentence for the 2009 attack
that aimed to kill nearly 300
people on Christmas Day in the
skies above Detroit.
Abdulmutallab calmly
answered the judge's questions
and read a political statement
warningthatifthe United States
continues "to persist and pro-
mote the blasphemy of Muham-
mad and the prophets," it risks
"a great calamity ... through the
hands of the mujahedeen soon."
"If you laugh at us now, we
will laugh at you later on the day
of judgment," he said.
Abdulmutallab suggested
more than a year ago that he
wanted to plead guilty but
never did.' He dropped his
four-person, publicly financed
defense team in favor of rep-
resenting himself with help
from a prominent local lawyer
appointed by the court, Antho-
ny Chambers.

In an interview, Chambers
said Abdulmutallab privately
renewed his interest in a guilty
plea Tuesday before the start
of the trial. But it did not hap-
pen immediately because the
defendant was not prepared to
go through the lengthy required
question-and-answer session
with the judge.
When the two met again
Wednesday morning, Abdul-
mutallab was ready, Chambers
said.
Prosecutors were aware of
a possible plea, but there were
no negotiations. Abdulmutallab
had "no interest" in speaking
to prosecutors, Chambers said,
and was unlikely to get any ben-
efit at this stage of the case.
"It was too late. We were
ready to go," U.S. Attorney Bar-
bara McQuade said.
Chambers wanted to go to
trial to raise doubts about just
how powerful the explosive
was. And if Abdulmutallab were
convicted, there was also a pos-
sible appeal involving the lack
of a Miranda warning before a
crucial FBI interview.
"I know he prayed about it
and came to what he believed
was the right decision," Cham-
bers said. "I don't think there
was anything done (at trial) that
made him say, 'This is a done
deal. I have to take a plea.' It was
a personal decision."
Passenger Lori Haskell of
Newport, Mich., watched the
plea by video from a room near
the court. She called Abdulmu-
tallab's statement "chilling" but
not surprising.
"I'm just really relieved that
it's done with," she said. .

The Amsterdam-to-Detroit
flight was just moments from
landing when Abdulmutallab
tried to detonate the bomb in his
pants. It failed to go off, but his
clothes caught fire, and passen-
gers jumped on him when they
saw smoke and flame.
The evidence was stacked
high.
The government said Abdul-
mutallab willingly explained
the plot twice, first to U.S. bor-
der officers who took him off
the plane and then in more
detail to FBI agents who inter-
viewed him at a hospital after
he was treated for burns to his
groin.
There were also photos of his
scorched shorts, video of Abdul-
mutallab explaining his suicide
mission before departing for the
U.S. and scores of passengers
who could have been called as
eyewitnesses.
Attorney General Eric Hold-
er said the plea "removes any
doubt that our courts are one
of the most effective tools we
have to fight terrorism," refer-
ring to a long-running debate
over whether suspects such as
Abdulmutallab should be tried
in civilian or military court-
rooms.
"We will let results, not rhet-
oric, guide our actions," Holder
said.
Dimitrios Bessis of Harri-
son County, Ga., sat two rows
behind Abdulmutallab on
Northwest Airlines Flight 253
and used his hat to beat out
the flames. He said his trip to
Detroit to serve as a potential
witness was his first plane ride
since the attempted attack.

Tear down trade barriers
Detroit meeting will be good for commerce
A 11 eyes will be on Detroit tomorrow as South Korean presi-
dent Lee Myung-bak and President Barack Obama convene
at the General Motors plant in Lake Orion, Mich. to promote
a trade deal between the United States and South Korea. In the first
trade agreements to pass Congress since 2007, the U.S. House and
Senate passed three free trade agreements yesterday, which will
ultimately increase international trade and promote commerce for
Aierican industries through overseas markets.

Grow new roots

In addition to negotiating this trade agree-
ment with South Korea, the U.S. will secure
trading partnerships with Colombia and Pan-
ama to further improve international com-
merce.- Passing the trade agreements with
these three countries could potentially boost
U.s exports by $13 billion through agricul-
ture, machinery and other goods and services.
The most substantive of the pacts, however,
would be with South Korea.
South Korean markets will provide near-
ly $11 billion in additional potential rev-
enue. Though trade agreements were almost
reached four years ago between the U.S. and
South' Korea, long disputes concerning South
Korea barriers to U.S. automotive imports
prevented their passage. Now, both nations
are pushing to quickly ratify the agreement,
which would allow each U.S. automaker to
import 25,000 cars into South Korea every
year.
In the agreement, South Korea would
change its automotive safety standards for
imported vehicles to those required for Amer-
ican vehicles. Additionally, South Korea plans
to cut the current tariffs on U.S. products in
half and eliminate them by the fifth year ofthe
agreement. While many South Koreans have
expressed a preference for domestic vehicles
because of safety concerns, they should be
assured that the U.S. safety standards are
amongthe highest in the world.
Capitalizing on this opportunity to engage

in increased international trade could prove
invaluable to the U.S. economy. Once enacted,
the trade agreements will create tens of thou-
sands of jobs for the country and small U.S.
enterprises will directly benefit from a larger
labor force. Economic growth will be boosted
by the increase in employment and the cre-
ation of new markets in which the U.S. can
export goods and services. The Motor City
will also reap the benefits associated with this
proposed surge in commerce thanks to the
auto industry's presence in Michigan.
The expansion of U.S. exports to South
Korea, Panama and Colombia coupled with
reduced tariff barriers on U.S. products will
further stimulate the struggling economy.
Since products exported from the U.S. to
South Korea currently face higher tariffs than
U.S. imports from South Korea, the trade deal
will level the playing field between the two
countries.
With lowered tariffs on U.S. exports to
international markets, the U.S. economy has
the potential to gain revenue. And with a
lower trade deficit, government spending will
not be sacrificed or affected by these trade
deals.
Gongress made positive progress for Mich-
igan-based automakers in approving the
agreements. This is an important business
opportunity for the companies involved and
has the potential to aid in the rebuilding of
Michigan's economy.

P retty much all cultures
have an established rite of
passage for young people.
Some of these
are ancient tra-
ditions, like the
Jewish bar- and
bat-mitzvah.
But there's no I
question what
the most impor-
tant one is for
middle-class JOEL
youth in Amer- BATTERMAN
ica today: going
to college. Now
that we're here, what does that say
about us and our society?
As I see it, the single-most
important thing about college is
that it's a place we leave home for.
The second is that it's a community
composed largely of people our own
age. That's easy to take for granted,
but in the sweep of history, it's
pretty darn unusual. Only within
the last century has it become so
routine for so many young people to
pack their bags and go off to live in
little enclaves for four years.
Our training for life is now an
experience of dislocation. The fam-
ily loses its gravitational pull. We
leave behind many - if not most,
or even all - of the people we've
known before. The communities
where we may have spent all our
years become a memory. Even those
of us who grew up nearby have
entered a distinctive social niche.
In Europe, it's common for under-
graduates to live at home and attend
school nearby. Not here, despite the
cost of housing. For Americans,
"college life" has to be its own dec-
laration of independence, or, when

parents turn into "pay-rents," at
least the imitation of one.
Uprooted from wherever we've
been, we're immersed in a big sea
of the similarly young and discon-
nected. The "student ghetto" is a
less isolated place than its name-
sake, but most student haunts are
decidedly segregated by age. You
might guess the Fountain of Youth
was spouting on Ingalls Mall by the
average ages of folks passing by.
At its best, this grand experiment
more than lives up to its promise of
liberation. Removed from the par-
ticular context of our upbringing
and inserted into a volatile crowd of
peers, we can gain space to discover
other ways of living, see the world
with new clarity, even loosen the
grip of certain kinds of oppression.
I got a reminder of this Monday
when I stepped out of the Hatcher
Graduate library and discovered
the National Coming Out Day rally
on the library's steps.
And it's no coincidence. So many
social movements in the past 50
years were nurtured at campuses
like ours - as the New Deal and
Baby Boom made higher education
a mass phenomenon. Isolated from
the world that bore them, and with
the power of numbers on their side,
these new concentrations of young
people decided they wouldn't toler-
ate Jim Crow, or war in Vietnam or
the burning of the Cuyahoga River.
Starting from places like the Diag,
they challenged the egregious fol-
lies of grown-ups and changed the
country for good.
Yet the college excursion also
carries big risks. Isolation from
the world can breed utopian think-
ing, but it's less helpful for utopian

practice. Most seriously, separation
from the people and communities
we've known can erode our sense of
responsibility toward others. Some
of the new groupings that form
in college may be extraordinarily
close-knit, but they are also, for the
most part, inevitably temporary.
Despite the great collective ritu-
als of Football Saturday solidarity,
one wonders if they only conceal a
growing atomization of ourselves,
if the experience of college doesn't
threaten to be one big acidbath that
dissolves us into a permanently
nomadic set of professional individ-
uals, every bit as liquid as the global
economy's flows of cash.
Leaving what
you know can be
liberating.
That would be an appropriate
rite of passage, given the troubled,
transient nature of our society. For-
tunately, while we didn't organize
this ritual, we still have the power
to make it serve our purpose, just as
the 1960s generation did. Instead of
acting out a dress rehearsal for the
world as it is, we could use college
to improvise what we'd like it to
be. We can't undo what brought us
here, nor would many of us want to,
but we can work to shape a future
that might emancipate us from the
alienated present.

Michigan Interactive Investments, a
student investment organization at the
University, is hosting its fourth annual Under-
graduate Investment Conference on Friday,
Oct. 14 and Saturday, Oct. 15., MII has invited
students, alumni, professionals and sponsors
to participate in the conference throughout
the"weekend. The UIC will feature a stock
pitch campetition - where teams select a
stock according to conference guidelines and
present it to a panel of judges - and serve as
an opportunity to meet professionals and
students from investment clubs at different
schools across the country. This interaction
allows students to learn from each other and
think about investment ideas and campus
investment clubs from a new perspective.
MII is focused on educating its members
about investing and financial markets. Older
students collaborate with younger students
to develop the technical and personal skills
for professional careers. Many of the com-
peting investment clubs are focused on the
same goal MII members are encouraged
to help organize the UIC or compete in the
competition.
In its inaugural year, the UIC was found-
ed to bring together investment clubs from
other universities to compete in the stock
pitch competition. The UIC has been suc-
cessful for the past three years due to the
participation of schools across the country,
Michigan alumni and corporate sponsors.
This year, the conference will host 16
schools - including the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania

and Carnegie Mellon - which will compete
for a $3,000 grand prize. Each team of two to
four students will deliver a 12-minute stock
pitch followed by eight minutes of Q & A on
Saturday morning. Three teams will be select-
ed to compete in the final round and will give
a longer stock pitch to a panel of four experi-
enced professionals, including head of debt
capital markets for SunTrust Robinson Hum-
phrey, Beau Cummins, and David MacGregor,
CEO of Longbow Research. These judges will
determine which school is the winner of the
competition and grand prize.
In the past, the UIC has hosted several Uni-
versity alumni as judges and speakers for the
event. MII will host Cummins, MBA class of
1989, of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey for
the third time. He will give a keynote speech
at 1p.m. on Saturday about careers in finance.
In addition, the event is sponsored by Long-
bow Research, Wells Fargo, BP and Blackrock.
The sponsors of this event are providing eight
first and final-round judges. Three first round
judges are MII alumni and friends.
The final round of the stock pitch competi-
tion will begin at 3p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 15.
The speech by Cummins and the final round
of the stock pitch competition will be open to
the public and held in the Blau Auditorium at
the Ross School of Business. We encourage
anyone who is interested to attend.
David Bleznak is a Ross School of Business
senior. He is the director of the Undergraduate
Investment Conference and also serves as
the vice president of operations for MIl

When I graduated from the University in 1995, I had
little idea of what I wanted to do professionally. I had a
general impulse to get training and skills, so I went to
work at an investment bank. It didn't take me long to
conclude that I was more interested in our clients than
I was in my job. What drew me to these companies were
the entrepreneurial stories of their founders. I realized
that the real creation of value was coming from these
visionary entrepreneurs and not the lawyers and bank-
ers. Pretty soon I left to throw my hat in the start-up
ring.
So at the ripe old age of 23, I founded my first com-
pany, Community Connect Inc., with four other friends.
We started the company out of my apartment, and I
ran it as CEO for more than 12 years until we grew the
company to about 150 employees and then sold it to a
publicly traded media company. Having started a com-
pany at such an early age with so little experience was
an incredible challenge, but I was fortunate to have the
support of some amazing entrepreneurs. Their mentor-
ship, combined with hard-won experience, has made
an enormous difference in my career. When I speak to
recent graduates who want to someday start or run a
company, I tell them to seek out mentors who will help
them develop professionally. Find someone who has
built a career like the one you want, and engage with
him or her until you get a good sense of how things are
done.
Right now,there are some phenomenal entrepreneurs
building successful businesses in Detroit, just a stone's
throw away. There's Brian Balasia, the co-founder of
Digerati who graduated from the University in 2003
and proceeded to build a business helping other busi-
nesses use technology to increase productivity. There's
Brett deMarrais, who graduated from the University
in 2009 and is now the CEO and Founder of Wedit, a
crowd-sourced wedding videography business set to
clear six-figures of revenue this year. And there's Phillip
and Ryan Cooley, whose destination restaurant Slow's
BBQ has revitalized the Corktown neighborhood. Phil-.

lip and Ryan are now working on a 28,000-square-foot
incubation space to house new enterprises.
These entrepreneurs and their success have given
rise to a new sense of opportunity and excitement in
the region. Josh Linkner, managing director of Detroit
Venture Partners and founder of ePrize, recentlytold us
how happy he was with the dozens of innovative com-
panies they've been seeing. DVP has already invested in
seven companies, with many more on the way.
For those of you who would like to follow in the
footsteps of Brian Balasia, Brett deMarrais, Phillip
Cooley, Ryan Cooley and even Josh Linkner, there's
the University's Center for Entrepreneurship, which,
under managing director Doug Neal, is one of the best
in the country. There's Bizdom U. - an entrepreneur-
ship accelerator funded by Dan Gilbert and based in
Detroit. And there is the Venture for America Fellow-
ship, which will be offered to roughly 50 of the top
college graduates in the country. Venture for America
Fellows will attend training camp held at Brown Uni-
versity next summer with experienced entrepreneurs
and investors before beginning work at a start-up
in Detroit or another low-cost city. After two years,
one Fellow will receive $100,000 in seed investment.
Applications are now open at www.ventureforamerica.
org/apply.
The path to entrepreneurship has historically been
less clearly marked than other paths. Indeed, that has
been one of its defining features. But the country, and
Michigan in particular, needs its best and brightest to
become entrepreneurs who build businesses and create
jobs more than ever. You will never be more able to take
risks than at this stage in your career. Entrepreneurship
is much like other professional paths in that you tend to
get better at it over time, but the decision to start must
be yours. The challenge is there for you, and the time to
start is now.

willing to refuse to appreci-
ate and bargain in good faith
with the very people who work
so tirelessly - so compassion-
ately - and who help make the
University health system such a
highly recognized and premier
health care institution in our
nation," Oppenheim said.
MNA President Jeffrey Bre-
slin also spoke at the event and
compared the union's nego-
tiations with the Occupy Wall
Street movement, in which pro-
testers across the nation are
voicing their discontent with
politicians and corporations.
"Wall Street caused this cri-
sis, and we demand Wall Street
pay us back. It wasn't Wall
Street that bailed out the banks.
It wasn't us that crashed the
economy. Yet we are the ones
that are suffering," Breslin said.
"Because nurses are America's
most trusted profession, and

because of our deep commit-
ment to patient advocacy, we're
demanding that our legislators
support (the) nurses' version
of the Occupy Wall Street cam-
paign."
Susan Ahlstrom, who has
worked at the University Hos-
pital as a nurse on the surgical
floor for three years, echoed
Breslin's sentiments regarding
the Occupy Wall Street move-
ment.
"The public has to realize
that nurses have jobs that are
demanding physically, emotion-
ally and intellectually," Ahl-
strom said. "... I think that the
money needs to be spread more
evenly when 1 percent of the
people are taking care of 90 per-
cent of the wealth."
Ahlstrom added that the pro-
posed benefit cuts hit close to
home considering the sacrifices
nurses make to care for their
patients like staying overnight
despite having families of their
own.l
"Health care workers want to

be able to receive the same kind
of care I give my patients," she
said.
Union leaders and local politi-
cians like State Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) and Yousef
Rabhi, a commissioner on the
Washtenaw County Board of
Commissioners and recent Uni-
versity graduates also addressed
the crowd yesterday and empha-
sized the importance of nurses
and the necessity of contract
negotiations.
Tom Mallon, a UMHS nurse
since 2004, said he's supporting
MNA because he is displeased
with how nurses are being treat-
ed.
"I've historically never been a
pro-union guy, but whenIsee the
University giving their adminis-
trators and giving their execu-
tives substantial pay increases
and then asking me - as a staff
nurse - to work more hours but
reduce my access to overtime
and increase my healthcare cost,
it's a slap in the face," Mallon
said.

that food goes directly into the

speech last month. "Knowing we
serve 2.5 million meals a year,
wasting less food and washing
far. fewer trays will deliver real
benefits."
Mike Lee, director of Residen-
tial Dining Services, added that
the University isn't able to collect
data on whether going trayless
will conserve water in the dining
halls.
The new plans for East Quad
dining hall include a dining area
designed specifically for trayless
dining after the residence hall
undergoes a $116 million renova-
tion next year. The dorm will be
closed for the 2012-2013 school
year and is scheduled to reopen in
fall 2013.
Lee said Coleman's announce-
ment will help shed light on sus-
tainable practices already in use
in dining services and other areas
of the University.
Trayless dining was imple-
mented as a pilot program in East
Quad in 2010 after students in an
Environment 590 class presented
the option. The students, along
with the help of University Hous-
ing officials, organized and moni-
tored East Quad going entirely
trayless for a few days. East Quad
was picked for the pilot, Lee said,
because it was thought that many

of the residents would be accept-
ing of the change.
"You always have some stu-
dents that may not be so positive,
but in East Quad the majority real-
ly support (sustainable options)"
Lee said.
In 2009, students attempted to
create a similar trayless pilot pro-
gram, over the course of 15 meals,
in Mary Markley Residence din-
ing Hall, but their project was
unsuccessful.
Upon completion of the 2010
pilot, East Quad became "tray-
light" by giving students the
option of using trays or not. LSA
sophomore Hannah Pearlman
and Art & Design sophomore
Hannah Nathans, both current
East Quad residents who also
lived there last year, said they
rarely use trays.
"It makes more sense," Pearl-
man said. "You've got two hands
- you can just carry it (without
trays)."
However, trayless dining poses
some challenges in larger dining
halls. University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said it is difficult
to implement the trayless model in
large dining halls where the serv-
ing areas are far from the dining
areas, or in dining halls with mul-
tiple levels like Hill Dining Center.
"There are some situations
in which trayless doesn't work
so well and where we have to be
first and foremost attentive to our
mission to provide a good din-
ing experience for the students,"
Logan said. "Where we can, we

do, and where it may not be prac-
tical, then we won't comprise the
primary mission of Residential
Dining Services."
Nathans said she notices a dif-
ference when she eats at Hill Din-
ing Center, which is not designed
to be trayless. She said she thinks
it would be an inconvenience to
not use a tray there because once
she finished eating, it would be
hard to know what to do with only
a plate.
To educate residents on the
trayless dining initiative in East
Quad, Dining Services provides
information to residents to make
them aware of trayless dining
procedures.
"I think it's a good idea," Pearl-
man said. "It comes to a point
where I think people need to
learn to be more aware of the
environment and deal with the
fact that you have to adapt to cer-
tain things to make the world a
better place, because that's what
it's about."
In addition to trayless dining,
the dining halls also incorporate
other sustainability efforts such
as using napkins made from recy-
cled materials and implementing
a pre-consumer waste compost,
in which excess food from cook-
ing meals is composted.
"Sustainability is certainly
something that we're trying to
fold into what we do, as long as it's
also consistent with or achieves
our responsibilities to provide a
quality residential experience for
students," Logan said.

PUBLISHERS
From Page 1A
dence in book retail.
"I sell books for a living, so
I'm charged with being eternally
optimistic," he said.
Jim Edwards, publisher and
CEO at Ann Arbor Editions, said
his company had a "fantastic"
relationship with Borders, but
it wasn't always sure about the
chain's long-term security.
Before Borders went out of
business, Ann Arbor Editions
published books produced by

Borders. Edwards explained that
while Ann Arbor Editions has
always made a small share of its
revenue from independent book-
stores, it relied on Borders as a
large source of business.
Foreseeing Borders's financial
decline starting about two years
ago, the company began to diver-
sify its sales and marketing strat-
egies through increasing online
sales and the use of social media.
Edwards added that though sales
are not as substantial as they pre-
viously were, Ann Arbor Editions
is a "healthier" company after
Borders's collapse.

"The uncertainty of (the) eco-
nomic realities of Borders is no
longer part of our day-to-day
decisions," Edwards explained.
He noted that the publishing
industry can learn a lesson from
Borders's mistakes and its subse-
quent closure.
"We really believe that with
the closing of Borders, it's a
wake-up call to everybody in
this business (that) we need to
be understanding our customers
and reaching them better direct-
ly, and in many ways reaching
around traditional booksellers,"
Edwards said.

'M' searches for go-to scorer

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson did something slightly
unusual for a Tuesday practice.
At the end of the
session, he had St.Lawrence
the middle of
the ice cleared at Michigan
by a Zamboni Matchup: St.
and puthis team Lawrence 0-2;
through a simu- Michigan 3-0
lated shootout. When: Thurs-

verines have Where:nYost

since the shoot- Michigandaily.
out rule was
instated three
years ago, soit's
highly unlikely they'll encounter
one against St. Lawrence (0-2) on
Thursday. Still, Berenson always
runs the team through a simu-
lation in the practice directly
preceeding a game, so the team
will gain confidence if the situa-
tion ever should arise. There was
another reason Berenson wanted
the extra reps in Tuesday's prac-
tice, too - he needed to evaluate
the talent. Right now, he has no
idea who would take the shots
with the game on the line.
"I'd like to find who those play-
ers are," Berenson said. "That's
another reason we do it - we're
not sure."
The choice would've been clear
last season. Michigan would've
invariably gone with a top scorer,
like Carl Hagelin or Louie Capo-
russo.
This year, the Wolverines don't
have such players. Sure, forwards
like senior David Wohlberg and
junior Chris Brown will light the
lamp with relative consistency,
but they're just not the natural
goal-scorers that Michigan has
had in the past.
"We don't have those guys,"
Brown said. "We have a couple
of guys who can really put the
puck in the net, but we don't have.

Blue falls to top-ranked
Fighting Illini on road

JED MOCH/Daily
Michigan coach Red Berenson is still seaching for a go-to scorer in the mold of a Carl Hagelin or Louie Caporusso.

those guys who are going (to go)
out on the ice and probably get a
goal."
That supposed lack of elite
goal-scoring talent has translat-
ed to 14 goals for Michigan (3-0)
this year. Not too shabby.
The Wolverines' offense didn't
skip a beat in the opening week,
partially due to the strength of its
opponents - Niagara and Bentley
are not exactly Miami (Ohio) or
Notre Dame - and also because
the whole team has contributed
to the scoring.
Nineteen players have record-
ed points through only one week
of play, including fifth-year senior
goalie Shawn Hunwick, who
picked up an assist in the first
game against Niagara. Michigan
had just five more players tally
a point all of last year. And nine
players this year have scored the
Wolverines' 14 goals.
"I think we're getting some
balanced scoring," Berenson
said. "But this is good. How pro-
lific we'll be offensively remains
to be seen, but I think we're
going to get more goals from
our defense as we get going, and
(junior forward) Kevin Lynch
hasn't played yet and (freshman

forward) Zach Hyman's going to
score, and so on. So we'll see, we
might have more offense on this
year's team."
Michigan will face a St. Law-
rence team limping into Yost Ice
Arena on Thursday. The Saints
finished 13-22-5 last season, good
for second to last in the ECAC.
They dropped their first two
games this season to Ferris State
by a combined six goals.
Berenson said that St. Law-
rence will still be an experienced,
gritty team. Its physical play
could make goals hard to come
by.
"Typically they're hard to play
against," Berenson said. "They
don't give you much and you've
got to earn it. So when we do
our man-on-man drills, that'll
go right into the game. You'll see
that on Thursday."
There will be an extra empha-
sis on defense in Thursday's
game, with scoringexpected to be
at a premium. That style matches
the Wolverines' approach to the
season - Brown said that prac-
tices this year have placed extra
stress on defense.
"We did lose a lot of guys,"
Brown said. "We've got to make

sure we're not giving up more
than two to three goals a game
since we know scoring is going to
be limited."
Hunwick said that until scor-
ers emerge, Michigan will have
to be an opportunistic team that
plays solid defense. Through
three games, the defense has
done its part. And the offense
has gotten it done, too, even if the
goals were sometimes what Hun-
wick described as "ugly."
The Wolverines did pump a
lot of shots on goal without much
to show for it early in games last
week, and Berenson said that
the team needs to do a better job
finishing. Still, they capitalized
when it counted, especially late,
and that may need to continue
for Michigan to have a potent
offense.
Berenson is still evaluating his
offense, but he said the key is the
'D.'
"When we looked at our team
last year, we were in the top
maybe five or six offensively, but
we were number one defensive-
ly," Berenson said. "That's why
we finished in first. And that's
what we're going to have to really
focus on with this team."

The No. 20 Michigan women's
volleyballteamsetagoal foritself
after the 25-14 loss in the first set
to No. 1 Illinois. It wanted to put
five more points on the board.
The Wolverines tacked on
those
five more MICHIGAN 1
points but ILLINOIS 3
ended up
losing the set, 25-19. In the locker
room they joked about how they
should have set their sights a lit-
tle higher - so they came out and
won the third, 25-21.
Going into the fourth set, they
decided to do it again. They were
neck-and-neck the whole way to
20 points, but their momentum
could only carry them so far.
Michigan lost the final set 25-20.
On Wednesday night, the
Fighting Illini (7-0 Big Ten,
18-0 Overall) added the Wolver-
ines (2-5 Big Ten, 14-5 Overall)
to the long list of teams left in
their undefeated wake. And the
loss was the fourth straight for
Michigan in its current Big Ten
slump.
The Wolverines lost the first
two sets due to a combination of
errors and an inability to mount a
serious offensive run. Senior out-
side hitter Alex Hunt, the hard-
hitting lefty, was having some
success going around Illinois's
front line down the side, but it
wasn't enough to pull out a win.
One set away from being
swept by Illinois, Michigan
looked to its middle blockers,
senior Courtney Fletcher and
sophomore Jennifer Cross, for
some momentum - they deliv-
ered in spades.
"We really wanted to establish
our middles in the third set," said
Michigan coach Mark Rosen.
"Jen and Fletch were doing a
great job of getting up quick and
swinging fast, and that's what

we needed them to do. Once
our middles got going, then that
opened up opportunities for
(redshirt junior outside hitter)
Claire (McElheny) and Ithought
that changed the game."
The Wolverines rode the
momentum from the third set
into the beginning of the fourth,
leading Illinois 9-5 at one point.
The Fighting Illini eventually
tied the set at 13 points apiece,
and Michigan kept the margin
within two until the very end.
But the Wolverines were never
able to retake the lead. The Wol-
verines were charged with the
task of toppling the top team in
the country on the road after
a surprise loss at home to an

sum business,
you either win
or lose."
unranked Wisconsin team last
weekend. Winning a set over Illi-
nois could be considered a step
forward.
While Rosen sees the game
only in terms of winning and los-
ing, he is admittedly proud of his
team's performance, despite the
fact that he knows it will need to
improve a great deal in order to
fight out of this slump.
"I think we took some pretty
big steps from three days ago to
now," Rosen said. "But we are in
the zero sum business, you either
win or you lose. There is no con-
solation. What we need to do is
improve the things we're work-
ing on enough to come out with
the win, which is what we're
here to do. That's what keeps us
fighting."

Robinson's throwing
issues are an easy fix

Brute strength anchors'D'

By TIM ROHAN
Daily SportsEditor
The second Denard Robinson
lets go of a pass, he can tell if
something's wrong.
Maybe his feet weren't right.
Maybe it wasn't the best decision.
Last Saturday against North-
western, when Robinson tied a
career high with three first-half
interceptions, the problem was
his hips.
"Do you transfer through
your throws when you set your
hips to throw?" asked Michigan
offensive coordinator Al Borges
on Tuesday. "If you can get your
hips set to the target and you can
transfer it through your throw,
you can do a lot of other things
wrong and still complete passes.
We didn't do that and that's why
we threw a couple of intercep-
tions."
Borges and Robinson "went
over the tape and doggone it we
beat it up one side and down the
other," as Borges said. They saw
Robinson sail two passes over
the head of fifth-year senior wide
receiver Junior Hemingway and
toss another carelessly into dou-
ble coverage, looking for junior
running back Vincent Smith.
"Over-striding," Robinson
said, diagnosing the problem.
"And every time you over-stride,
the ball tends to sail.
"It's really easy to correct. I
mean, we've been working on it
all fall and summer."
Most of Robinson's mistakes
are easy to correct. Simple tech-
nique and fundamentals usu-
ally are, but now he just has to be
more consistent in his approach.
Each time he struggled early
against Notre Dame and North-
western - two of Michigan's
toughest opponents so far - then
he improved in the second half.
He threw for 202 yards, com-
pleting 7-of-10 passes for three
touchdowns and one intercep-
tion in just the fourth quarter
against the Fighting Irish, then
completed 7-of-8 passes for 139
yards in the second half against
the Wildcats.
And the Wolverines outscored
their opponents 56-7 during
those three quarters.
After the Northwestern game,
Robinson admitted to being
excited and amped up at the
start, just like he was against
Notre Dame when he started
poorly and recovered late. The
overthrows may have been over-
striding, but they were ultimately
blamed on an "excitable" quar-
terback, as Michigan coach Brady
Hoke likes to call him.
"He's not the first guy to have
that happen to him," Borges said.
" He was fired up. It's interesting.

"They're a good team all
around," said Michigan coach
Greg Ryan. "They're a solid
defensive team, but I don't
think they were really worried
about defending us because
they knew that we didn't have
our personnel in place, and
rightly so. I give them a lot of
credit for having a very aggres-
sive game plan."

KICK ONE FOR THE GIBBER:
Up 11 points in the fourth quar-
ter, Michigan didn't necessar-
ily need redshirt sophomore
kicker Brendan Gibbons to hit
the 47-yard field goal he stared
down. But it would've been nice.
Gibbons's kick was blocked,
Hoke explained Thursday,
because the guard just couldn't
handle the two or three guys
Northwestern threw at him.
With the miss, Gibbons fell to
4-for-6 on the season, connect-
ing on all four kicks inside the
40-yard line and missing tries of
40 and 47 yards.
Hoke previously said that if
the kick was too long for Gib-
bons, freshman kicker Matt
Wile would be called upon from
a certain distance. But that plan
seems to have changed.
Hoke was comfortable send-
ing Gibbons out for the 47-yarder
against Northwestern because
he's seen the kicker hit from 55
yards, "with a little bit of dis-
tance to it."
But has he supplanted Wile as
the long-range field goal kicker?
"I don't know," Hoke said.
"I have a lot of faith in Brendan
right now."

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson has thrown nine interceptions this seasor.

You can feel it pregame the way
the guy's going to go. Basically
you want to make sure he under-
stands to keep a good fundamen-
tal foundation. Do the things that
are right about the position. It's
a finesse art, and if you let your
emotions override your funda-
mentals, like any other position,
you'll struggle.
"Once he got a groove, it all
changed. You could see it. You
could really see it. Second half, he
flung one dig on third down, and
I could tell he was back. Every
quarterback, even great quarter-
backs sometimes, they have those
kinds of games."
Borges praised his quarter-
back's ability to recover once he
did make a bad throw. But the one
mistake Borges can live without
is the interception - Robinson
has already thrown nine in six
games this season. Only two of
the top-100 rated passers have
thrown more interceptions than
Robinson.
Borges's mantra is simple:
"You can recover from incom-
plete passes."
Turnovers hurt more.
They certainly did a year ago
when Robinson ran into his first
roadblock of a Heisman-hyped
start to his 2010 season - rival
Michigan State.
In perhaps his worst passing
game of the season, Robinson
threw three interceptions and
quarterbacked four drives that
ended in three-and-outs.
"There were some turn-

overs that hurt (Michigan last
year)," Borges said of the 2010
Michigan-Michigan State game.
"Mostly a lot of the same stuff we
did last game. That was pretty
much it. There were times when
I've watched last year where they
looked like they moved the ball
pretty good on them, but there
were some issues with just not
being able to finish drives."
If he sticksto his fundamentals
and avoids letting his excitement
inhibit his throwing motion, the
2011 season has proved Robinson
should be fine against the Spar-
tans.
"Big thing is he's got to let the
game come to him sometimes,"
Hoke said.
Regardless, Borges isn't a
believer in benching quarter-
backs, even if he wasn't coaching
Denard Robinson.
"Just because a kid throws a
couple of picks, pulling him out
of the game - I know a lot of guys
who are quick trigger guys and
they'll say, 'He's not playing well,
we'll get the other guy in there,'
" Borges said. "We're never doing
that. They can boo or do whatev-
er. ... You want to stick with that
guy, and if you stick with him you
give him a chance to prove that
he's your leader and the team will
believe in him. But if you go south
on him, I just don't believe that's
a good way of doing it.
"Now I've taken quarterbacks
out before, but that's usually
because they've lost their confi-
dence."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

_

Kirk Cousins might not
be speaking with some
of his friends back home
in Holland, Mich. after
beating their Michigan
Wolverines three straight
years. But Cousins sure
has done enough to eas-
ily find. some new ones.
Michigan State's senior
quarterback has thrown
for more than 5,000
yards, nearly 40 touch-
downs the past two sea-
sons and he's helped
"Little Brother" grow up
in a big way. At Big Ten
Media Day in August,
Cousins sat down with
the Daily to talk about
the upcoming season:
The Michigan Daily: Kirk
Cousins, do you hate Michigan?
Kirk Cousins: I don't hate
anybody. I think hate's a strong
word. But the rivalry is personal.
I grew up in Michigan. I grew up
in Holland. And when you have
friends that say they'll root for

you every day but one, they don't
understand: you're either with
me or against me. It's sort of like
if Isaid, I like you, but I don't like
your kids or your wife.' You're
either with me or against me. And
to say you'll root for me every day
but one, you might as well just not
root for me at all. We need to beat
Michigan. We need to beat Mich-
igan, I've said that every year.
They will be ready. Michigan will
be ready when they come play us
in Spartan Stadium. They will
come loaded. And we will need to
play a tremendous game to beat
them.
TMD: How well do you know
Denard Robinson?
Cousins: I don't know Denard
at all. I've never spoken to him.
I know him pretty well because
he's on TV a lot. So I guess I see
his highlights a lot. I know his
great plays. He's a tremendous
player, tremendous athlete. He
deserves all the hype, or all the
attention he's gotten because he's
just a tremendous player. And he's

for leadership. What Jesus did
above all other leaders was ser-
vice. He served people. So agoalof
mine as a leader is to be a servant.
So now if you go and talk to the
other players, they'll tell you dif-
ferently - that I'm not a servant.
But I try to be. And when I do that,
that's my bestway of leading.
TMD: Your leader and coach,
Mark Dantonio, seems to have
the backing of your whole team.
How much does that help?
Cousins: We're actually
believers in Coach Dantonio. And
I think the proof is in the pud-
ding. Four years now, he's won
a Big Ten Championship and
brought this program to new
heights. He's given us every rea-
son to get behind him and believe
in him.
TMD: Does it feel good to be a
part of the Spartans' resurgence?
Cousins: Yeah, yeah it does.
It's very fulfilling to be a part of
it. But my career's not done. We'll
see when the last chapter is writ-
ten come December or January.

But there's no doubt to have a Big
Ten championship already on our
resumes is a special thing. And no
one can take that away from us
going forward.
TMD: Is there any added pres-
sure on you, with the type of
supporting cast Michigan State
returns? It's your job to perform,
right?
Cousins: If anything, it makes
my job easier to throw to three
senior receivers and hand off to
three experienced runningbacks
who could all be top running
backs in the Big Ten. My job is
to just be a distributor, to make
great decisions and get them the
football. No one's going to put
more pressure on me than I put
on myself. And it's been that way
since I was a redshirt. I came in
as a freshman and had a lot to
learn. I had higher expectations
of myself, than any coach or any
media member or any fan. And
as a result, I think I don't let the
pressure or the expectations get
to me.

Spartan senior quarterback Kirk Cousins led Michigan State to a share of the
Big Ten title and a Capital One Bowl berth a season ago.

going to have another greatyear.
TMD: What kind of leader are
you, Kirk?
Cousins: I'll put it this way:

what kind of leader I try to be.
The greatest leader of all time was
Jesus Christ. So I go to the Bible
and read the Gospels to get insight

Secondary improving, still a work in progress for Blue

0

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
secondary needed to make big
changes after ranking 112th in
pass defense last season. But sec-
ondary coach Curt Mallory start-
ed small.
A two-year letter winner for
the Wolverines from 1989-90,
Mallory came back to Ann Arbor
after spending last year as the
defensive coordinator and cor-

nerbacks coach at Akron. He took
over the secondary when Hoke
was hired and went about adjust-
ing the players' technique.
In spring ball, he realized
sophomore cornerback Court-
ney Avery took a false step - a
small step forward before back-
peddling. He fixed*it in about five
practices.
"One false step or one bad step
here, he's going to talk to you
about it even if you do make the
play," Avery said. "I thought it was

a small thing. I was like, 'come on
coach,' but it is important, and I
see that now."
That emphasis on technique
has the Wolverines' secondary
telling a different story, even if
Michigan coach Brady Hoke isn't
pleased yet. No. 11 Michigan is
now ranked 32nd nationally in
pass defense. After giving up 23
passing plays of 30-plus yards last
season, it's surrendered just three
this season, and none more than
40 yards. While the improvement

seems vast, Hoke says the unithas
only improved "some" since the
beginning of the year.
"We are a long way from being
a good secondary," Hoke said.
According to Hoke, the big-
gest problem hasn't been the long
passes that plagued the unit last
year - it's been the short ones.
The backs aren'tgettingoffblocks
well enough or supporting the
runs or bubble screens.
Northwestern ran the bubble
screen nine times last Saturday,
completing every pass and aver-
aging about seven yards a recep-
tion. As the Wolverines made
adjustments in the second half,
the yards per screen decreased
but the completions remained.
The task of stopping the short
passes usually falls to the cor-
nerbacks, which have consisted
of redshirt junior J.T. Floyd and
a rotation of fifth-year senior
Troy Woolfolk, Avery and fresh-
man Blake Countess. And with
Hoke, helping them defend is
simple.
"You show it to them," he said.
"You talk about their technique
and their hips and if they're
keeping their feet under their
hips, not opening up. There's a
lot of technique, and you can't
defend all of those."
While Floyd has generally
remained in the game on one
side, the rotation among the

I

Redshirt junior cornerbackJ1T. Floyd has three pass break-ups in sir tames.

other three has increased in
recent weeks, as Woolfolk has
been banged up and Countess has
received more playing time. In
certain situations, Avery has left
the rotation to play nickel back, a
position he also played as a fresh-
man.
"You don't want to get caught
up in how much playing time
you're getting," Avery said. "At
times (it's tough getting into a
rhythm), but I feel like we rotate
pretty well."
Avery will feel comfortable
wherever he plays next Saturday.
He played nickel back significant-
ly against the Spartans last season
and knows the challenge Michi-

gan State's receivers pose.
The Spartans' corps possesses
the most depth the secondary has
seen this season, with B.J. Cun-
ningham, Keshawn Martin and
Keith Nichol lining up on the out-
side. This week, defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison said he
believes Cunningham is an NFL-
caliber player. And as the second-
ary triesto stop the short routes, it
knows what the stakes are if it lets
a reciever get open deep.
"You can say anything you
want about the secondary," Mat-
tison said last week. "But you're
one big pass away from not look-
ing like you should look, and they
understand that."

THE $iC1IIUMION M 5
1908 1909
or nearly a century, the Michigan Union has towered over campus.
Within its ivy-covered walls lies a wealth of history that all too
often goes unnoticed. Take some time to wander among the oak-
paneled rooms with their comfy leather armchairs and stained-
glass windows - it's easy to feel the spirit of the University in such
historic surroundings.
As you explore, you may stumble upon a small lounge on the first floor.
Adorning the walls of the room is a series of frames displaying photographs,
newspaper clippings and brightly colored posters. At first glance, you may be
shocked to see black-and-white images of rather homely women. But a plaque
near the entrance soon clears things up - these are no women.
From 1908 to 1955, all-male groups of students produced and performed
wildly popular original shows known as the Michigan Union Operas. As part
of a long-standing tradition, men played all of the roles, male and female. But
beyond their entertainment appeal, the operas served a greater purpose: With-
out the participation of hundreds of corsetrwearing cross-dressers, the Michi-
gan Union might never have been built.
The need for a Union -1904-1918
Established in 1904, an organization called the Michigan Union was created
to bring together all male students on campus. The University's tiny popula-
tion of women already had such an organization, which met in the now non-
existent Barbour Gym. In his book "The Michigan Union 1904-2004:100 Years
of Student Life," 1992 Michigan alum Jeff Rowe, who also serves as the Media
and Events Coordinator at the Union, chronicles the history of the men's Union
from this early period.
According to Rowe's book, the Michigan Union had raised enough money by
1907 to purchase a home - in the Union's current spot on State Street - that
would serve as a temporary clubhouse for it. A sizable portion of the funds for
the clubhouse was raisedby a small performing troupe known as the Michigan
Union Minstrel Show, a group that would develop into the Michigan Union
operas a year later when the Union started raising money to build a larger per-
manent headquarters.
The very first Michigan Opera, "Michigenda," premiered in February 1908
at the Whitney Theater located downtown at the corner of Main St. and Ann
St. The term "opera" is a bit of a misnomer - the show was more akin to comic
operetta with elements of vaudeville and minstrel shows. Earning a profit of
$2,000 for the Union, "Michigenda" was a tremendous hit - The Detroit Jour-
nal wrote that audiences insisted on five encores of the show's finale number
one night.
The success of "Michigenda" ensured that the Michigan Union Operas
would be an annual event - and a reliable cash cow for the Union. December
1908 saw the second opera, "Culture," which featured a giant 10-footslide rule
that could answer any question.
A year later in December 1909, "Koanzaland" was produced at the Whitney.
The show centered on Buck and Sliv, "two Michigan rah-rahs" who fly a zeppe-
lin from Ann Arbor to "darkest Africa." The work was racially insensitive, like
many of its time, but it did produce one of the University's most-loved college
songs, "College Days." This bittersweet tune was composedby School of Music
Prof. Earl V. Moore, who would go on to serve as dean of the Music School from
1921 to 1960.

FOOD WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
CORNED BEEF HASH

4
4

FRANK'S
334 Maynard Street
The hash is formed into a patty with a
nice texture: soft and tender inside with
a nice crust on the outside. The focus is
the mashed meat. Some sort of vegetable
chunks are visible, but limited. This is
unfortunate, because more vegetables
might distract from the nagging thought
that your plate was accidentally swapped
with the dog's.
MR. GREEK'S
215 South State Street
Corned beef hash isn't the sexiest food.
Most of us would prefer bacon, the prom
queen of breakfast meats. Still, like an
expensive stylist, Mr. Greek's does its
best with the plain Jane of corned beef,
adding a tangy blend of spices and flavor-
ful onions to the beef/hash mixture. It
almost works, except every other bite is
sort of bland. Add hot sauce.

ANGELO'S
1100 Catherine Street
The potatoes are the star of Angelo's
version of corned beef hash. The meat is
delicious, but acts as more of an adorn-
ment than an equal one half of the dish.
It's the tinsel, not the tree. It's a fried
mass, crispy on the edges but not too
greasy, and it's all complemented by deli-
cious eggs and the world-famous scrump-
tuousness that is Angelo's toast.
FLEETWOOD DINER
300 South Ashley Street
Technically speaking, Fleetwood Diner's
hippie hash isn't cornedbeef hash at all and
should be disqualified. But the stuff is just
so unflinchingly addictive - the crunchy
potatoes, the crispily cooked veggies, that
perfect touch of feta - this Ann Arbor sta-
ple can't be left off the hash-lover's menu.
Maybe we don't live in the best corned beef
town, but hippie hash makes up for it.

And the winner is: Fleetwood Diner

OPERAS
From Page 1B
Two more Union Operas fol-
lowed "Koanzaland": 1910's
"Crimson Chest," a pirate tale,
and 1911's "The Awakened
Ramses," a riotous mummy com-
edy. "Ramses" began the tradi-
tion of including football players
in the operas, after they stepped
in at the last minute when half of
the cast was deemed ineligible to
participate.
"Not only were the guys play-
ing the women's roles, but these
big, beefy, hairy guys were play-
ing the women's roles," Rowe
said.
By then, the operas had
become a regular fixture on cam-
pus, yet a lack of organization
and continuity from year to year
was a problem. So in 1912 a fixed
managerial position was created,
andthe Operawas organized into
a permanent theatrical organiza-
tion known as the Mimes. In the
introduction to his score of the
Mimes' first show, 1913's "Con-
trarie Mary," Prof. Moore wrote
that the formation of the Mimes
would allow for the "attainment
of ideals hitherto impossible."
Women in the operas -
World War I
The creation of the Mimes also
began the tradition of taking the
Michigan Union Operas on the
road. After "Contrarie Mary"
successfully toured, subsequent
productions made visits to cities
across Michigan and the Mid-
west.
"Michigan alumni were - and
are - everywhere," said Marilyn
McNitt, an associate archivist at
the Bentley Historical Library
who organized a 2008 exhibit
celebrating the Mimes' 100th
anniversary. "So they would go
to places where there were large
groups of alumni. And then other
people would hear about it, too.
It was new and fresh - there
weren't a lot of college troupes
going on the road to perform their
original plays. And all guys!"
With the aid of funds raised
from the Mimes' local produc-
tions and road shows, the Union
was able to complete just the
exterior of its new clubhouse,
which can still be seen today. But
when war broke out between the
U.S. and Germany in 1917, finish-
ing the interior became a dire
necessity. A government loan
allowed the Union to be complet-
ed enough to serve as a barracks
and mess hall for the Student
Army Training Corps.
In 1918, with much of the Uni-
versity's male population enlist-
ed or conscripted, the Mimes
faced a major dilemma: whether
to allow women students to par-
ticipate in the Michigan Union
Opera.
"The Union was a male bas-
ket," McNitt said. "It was really
hard for them to let women in.
There was a big controversy
about that."
Many protested the inclusion
of women, claiming this would
ruin a decade-old tradition.
Yet the faculty, including Prof.
Moore, objected to "the impro-
priety of sending out to its alum-
ni an entertainment representing
the university with a score of men
frolicking in petticoats when the

nation is at war," according to an
article published in an unidenti-
fiable newspaper in January 1918.
Feminism won out, and in
March 1918 "Let's Go," the only
D Michigan Union Opera in his-
tory to feature women in the cast,
was produced. With a score by
Prof. Moore, this propagandistic
wartime comedy helped to raise
funds for the war effort.
The heyday of the Michigan
Union Opera - The 1920s
With the end of the war in
November 1918, the doughboys
returned to Ann Arbor and the
University's women were forced
out of the spotlight. The Mimes
resumed their all-male tradition
for the March 1919 production of
"Come on Dad."
The Michigan Union also
opened in 1919. The building -
which would become the heart
of the University community
in the coming decade - housed
common areas, dining rooms,
ballrooms, libraries, a hotel,
a soda bar, a barber shop, an
indoor swimming pool (where
D Barnes and Noble is located
today) and a bowling alley. Yet
women, who had helped save
the Michigan Union Opera the
year before, were only allowed

to enter through a back door and
had tobe accompanied by a male
escort while in the building.
"We were such a dominant
men's university," said Carl
Smith, a retired CPA who serves
as faculty advisor for the Men's
Glee Club. "Women had their
League; men had the Michigan
Union. That was just the way it
was. It took a long while for that
to change."
With the arrival of the 1920s
the following year, there was an
explosion in the popularity and
sheer size of the Michigan Union
Operas, reflecting the extrava-
gance and excitement of the
Roaring Twenties.
With elaborate sets and cos-
tumes that required custom-
designedshoes, the Union Operas
of the '20s were on par with pro-
fessional theater companies. Pro-
duction costs soared as high as
$80,000 (comparable to $1 mil-
lion today). The quality of female
impersonation also reached new
levels with the December 1923
production "Cotton Stockings,"
which starred leading "lady" Lio-
nel Ames.
"He was so good that there
were men who saw him in his
performance and didn't real-
ize that he was a female imper-
sonator," McNitt said. "So they
would wait for him backstage
with flowers and candy, and he
would walk bythem.
"He had very delicate, femi-
nine features. He was a very
attractive, um, 'woman."'
Ames, who would eventually
become a professional female
impersonator, led "Cotton Stock-
ings" on a 15-city tour that
included performances in Chi-
cago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,
Washington and New York's
Metropolitan Opera House.
"(His legs) were insured
because the routines in 'Cotton
Stockings' were so acrobatic,"
McNitt said. "They were afraid
that he'd fall and hurt himself....
They wanted to make sure that
if their star hurt himself, they
didn't lose everything."
In crisis - The Depression
and World War II
Yet, the dazzling and carefree
era of the '20s, the Michigan
Union Operas would grind to
a halt when financial difficul-
ties set in. Beginning in 1927 the
operas failed to turn a profit,
and by 1929 the Mimes had lost
a total of $15,000 from three
productions. The stock market
crash of that same year was also a
major contributor to the Opera's
demise.
In 1934 the Union Operas
made a brief revival with two
productions, but this revival was
short-lived. The University didn't
see another Mimes production
until .1940's "Four Out of Five,"
which starred the Wolverines'
halfback, eventual Heisman Tro-
phy winner Tom Harmon.
Two more Union Operas were
produced in December 1941, but
these would be the last produc-
tions for several years. Four days
before "Take a Number" opened,
the Japanese attacked the Ameri-
can fleet at Pearl Harbor. Just
as in World War I, the Mimes'
activities were interrupted
when much of the University's
male population marched off to

the Pacific or Europe. With the
women on campus mobilized to
assist the war effort, this made
even a co-ed Union Opera impos-
sible.
The Michigan Union Opera
Renaissance - The 1950s
With the end of the war in
1945 and the introduction of the
G.I. Bill, men soon returned to
campus en masse. With the Uni-
versity's male population now
restored, it seemed sensible to
bring back the all-male Union

Saying Ido-'
for the dollars

Cross-dressing actor Lionel Ames had his legs insured for "Cotton Stackings."

Operas. 1949's "Froggy Bottom,"
the first production in seven
years, centered on the lives of
tenants in Willow Run Village
apartments, a housing facility the
University created for returning
veterans who had married. The
show was also the first Michigan
Union Opera run entirely by stu-
dents.
"This was a novel experience
for everybody in it," said Phelps
Connell, a 1950 'U' alum who
played in "Froggy Bottom."
"Whoever was running it
imported a professional director
from Broadway to come in and
direct the show," Connell added.
"I can't imagine how he did it,
but he had to teach people who
had never danced before how
to dance and had to teach the
acting. It had to take incredible
patience."
Though the Union Operas
were successfully integrated
into post-war campus culture,
the 1950s saw much debate sur-
rounding the now-antiquated
tradition of men playing wom-
en's roles. In 1954, a committee
was formed to address this and
other problems that plagued the
Mimes. According the commit-
tee's report, the cross-dressing
element was now "in poor taste"
and modern audiences were tir-
ing of this archaism.
While the committee ulti-
mately voted against a co-ed
Opera, the "apparent feminiza-
tion of the choruses" was dis-
continued. Instead, the sex of
the men in drag had to be appar-
ent to audience members at all
time. The sort of gender bending
that Lionel Ames had perfected
more than 30 years before was
replaced with what the report
called "hairy legs and male mas-
querade."
And yet the co-ed debate raged
on. Both sides of the issue were
manifested in the shows during
the 1950s, which contain increas-
ingly nostalgic subject matter
and feminist themes. 1954's "Hail
to Victor" took place in turn-of-
the-century Ann Arbor, when the
all-male Michigan Union Operas
were just beginning, but focuses
on the women's suffrage move-
ment with an opening number
titled "It's Equality We Demand."
Despite this attempt at open-
mindedness, the Mimes' days
were numbered. 1955 saw the
final Michigan Union Opera,
"Film Flam." In 1956 - the same
year women were first allowed
through the front door of the
Union - the Mimes changed
their name to MUSKET (Michi-

gan Union Shows, Ko-Eds Too)
and began performing main-
stream Broadway shows. The all-
male cast hung up their garters
and corsets for good as real-live
women took the stage.
Why not today?
While MUSKET has been a
source of quality entertainment
on campus for the last 55 years,
its shows bear little in common
with the cross-dressing, satirical
spectacles of the Michigan Union
Operas. The change to MUSKET
and the switch to well-known
musicals ensured that any ves-
tiges of the drag tradition would
be eliminated; yet this also did
away with the original, student-
created material.
Would student-run shows in
the tradition of the Union Operas
have an appeal on campus today?
A revival of "Michigenda" or
"Koanzaland" would most likely
come across as outdated and even
offensive in the case of the latter.
Yet original productions focus-
ing on modern student life and
lampooning campus celebrities
like University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Michigan football
coach Brady Hoke or quarterback
Denard Robinson could generate
considerable interest.
The Union Operas' niche may
already be filled by such Univer-
sity organizations like Basement
Arts and the Educational Theatre
Company (ETC), which perform
their own shows. Team StarKid
of "A Very Potter Musical" fame
has even toured across the coun-
try, bringing to mind the Mimes'
road shows. So while MUSKET
may be the direct descendant
of the Michigan .Union Operas,
campus theater troupes like
these can be seen as their spiri-
tual successors.
As for the Michigan Union
Operas themselves, all that is
left are a few cardboard boxes
of scores, programs and photo-
graphs at the Bentley Library.
While there are some reminders
around campus, like the opera
Lounge in the Union and the
School of Music's Earl V. Moore
Building, the Mimes and their 36
productions are quickly fading
into obscurity.
As a 1930 Detroit News article
stated: "Thus, with a final glitter
of its costumes, and a last ges-
ture of its he-she chorus, into the
discard tumbles an institution
which cometed from unpreten-
tious beginnings into a series of
musical revues of a technical per-
fection and beauty."

J t finally happened. We
haven't solved the economic
crisis in America, we still
haven't resolved the unrest in
the Middle East and our public
school system
is still down
the tubes.
But rest easy
because ...
Kim Kar-
dashian is
married! Yes,
it's true - HALEY
Kim and Kris GOLDBERG
Humphries,
an NBA bas-
ketball player, tied the knot on
Aug. 20 in Montecito, Calif.
Kris - who so conveniently
fits in with the all-'K' first initials
of the Kardashian family clan -
and Kim became engaged after
only six months of dating (though
they still dated longer than Kim's
sister Khloe, who married Lakers
basketball player Lamar Odom
after one month). The two-night
weddingspecial E! aired, nos-
talgically titled "Kim's Fairytale
Wedding: A Kardashian Event,"
gave us an inside look at the wed-
ding and, of course, the drama
behind the "I Do's." But how
much did the fairytale spectacle
that had us glued to the tube for
two nights actually cost?
Thanks to TheHollywoodRe-
porter.com, we know the major
expenses. And just takea look
at these figures: $2.5 million for
the Lorraine Schwartz head-
piece Kim wore when walking
down the aisle, $5 million for
the 28-carat earrings she wore,
$200,000 for her wedding band
- which includes "15 carats of
emerald-cut diamonds" - and
$150,000 for her grooming,
including hair and makeup.
These figures don't even include
the cost of the private estate the
newlywed couple rented, the
three custom-made Vera Wang
gowns Kim wore throughout the
night and the catering of celebrity
chef Wolfgang Puck!
Don't worry about Bruce Jen-
ner's wallet being empty after
the event, as the Kardashian
family had help paying offthese
costs from the money made off
the wedding. Kim waspaid to
get married ... sort of. People
magazine spent $1.5 million for
exclusive access and licensing
fees for photos, accordingto
TheHollywood Reportercom.
The magazine didn't even feature
Kris on the cover, just a solo shot
of Kim.
And other people are making
money off of her marriage too.
E! charged up to $100,000 for
ad rates duringKim's wedding
special, which it anticipated
would be seen by five million
viewers. Call me old fashioned,
but isn't a weddingsupposed to
be a celebration of love between
two people, not a commodity
exploitedby reality television and
gossip magazines? Since when
has getting married become a
business where people not even
working for the wedding can

"make money" off the nuptials?
Can these extravagant weddings
actually lead to what matters the
most - a good marriage?
The answer to that question
can be found in any gossip maga-
zine on any given week. While we
see many celebrities engaging in
these lavish ceremonies, we also
see an excess of celeb marriages
ending in bitter divorces. Take
Eva Longoria and Tony Parker,
for example. Their July 7, 2007
wedding at a chateau in Paris was
estimated around $1.5 million
according to People.com. Their
divorce? Finalized this January.
How about Jennifer Lopez and
Marc Anthony'swedding? Lopez
wore more than $7 million in
jewelry at their ceremony in June
2004. After seven years, they
called it quits this July.
Kim and Kris:
money or love?
While I'm not predicting that
Kim and Kris's marriage will end
the same way or saying putting
a significant amount of money
into a wedding will always lead
it astray, it's hard not to make a
connection between the two. An
exception is Kim's sister Khloe,
who married Lamar in the same
lavish fashion with a reality tele-
vision extravaganza and recently
celebrated her one-year anniver-
sary with him. Maybe the big fat
reality television wedding can
lead to a lasting marriage.
But when and why have wed-
dings become such a commercial
spectacle? Why couldn't Kim
and Kris have simply gone down
to the courthouse and tied the
knot there? Well, anyone who has
watched "Keeping Up with the
Kardashians" knows the Kar-
dashian family does not do things
without effect. The family has a
reality show based on the mem-
bers' lives, and in order to keep
viewers interested they have to
go big or go home.
But what does that say about
Kim's marriage? Is it real, ortis it
all for the sake of the ad price E!
can charge on the special, or the
money that was paid by People
for the rights to the wedding?
Even parts of the wedding special
were reported by PerezHilton.
com to have been scripted. While
E! depicted the image of love
between Kim and Kris, we won't
know for sure until we see their
marriage last. And as a Kardashi-
an fan, I hope Kim and Kris are
truly happy. But still, as a follow-
er ofcelebrity gossip, I've seen
too many of these over-the-top
weddings end in divorce. While
the weddinghad all the amenities
one could think of, let's hope for
Kim and Kris that it had the one
key component: love.

CELLULAR CREATIVITY
Art under the microscope

DTHE VAULT 'SHERLOCK JR:(1924), METRO PICTURES

Bioartography
looks at aesthetics
of microbes
By ELLIOT ALPERN
Daily Arts Writer
The image - a blue backdrop
with swirls of yellow, clusters
of red dots and a certain dis-
cernible texture - could easily
be attributed as a post-Impres-
sionist oil painting. Its title is
"Van Gogh's Skin," alluding to
the close resemblance in col-
ors and pattern with the Dutch
master's famous "Starry Night."
However, the nuanced hues and
seemingly intricate design belie
the picture's true nature - that
wavy red band at the top is actu-
ally the skin surface of a mouse,
and those red dots are stained
tumor cells.
The image is a sample of bas-
al-cell carcinoma, the most com-
mon type of skin cancer found in
humans and a valuable affliction
to study through the use of ani-
mal research at the University's
Center for Organogenesis.
And "Van Gogh's Skin" is an
example of bioartography, which
presents one of the few oppor-
tunities for typically unrelated
fields - in this case biology, pho-
tography, and art - to be amal-
gamated. Such a coalition opens
up the chance to tap into a vast
endless subject matter: nature.
None should know this bet-
ter than Brad Smith, the associ-
ate dean for creative work at the
School of Art & Design, and a
professor who previously direct-
ed a program in biomedical illus-
tration.
"What nature presents to
us, and what we discover and

find and unearth in nature, is
very visually rich, and opens up
many intriguing questions just
by looking at it and seeing it,"
Smith said.
The idea of bioartography was
conceived six years ago as an
answer to a completely different
problem: restrictions on trav-
el money for student training
grants. Strapped for extra fund-
ing, Deborah Gumucio, a pro-
fessor in the Medical School's
department of cell and devel-
opmental biology, and her col-
leagues realized that the answer
was all around them.
"We thought, 'Well, what've
we got that we can raise money
with?' " Gumucio said. "And we
realized that our images were
really gorgeous and that a lot of
them were artistic and had a lot
of artistic appeal."
The work also represents a
different side of the art umbrel-
la. Unlike pastorals or scenic
views, the pieces are a direct
result of natural elements, rath-
er than a simple inspiration from
the subject.
"Art can sometimes be inor-
ganic, but the art of a butterfly,
or the art of a flower, or a person
- any of that visual art is organ-
ic," Gumucio said. "And this is
just going deeper with it - this
is just beginning to look at the
structure not only of a tissue, but
going deeper to look at the struc-
ture of the cells."
The images are a by-product
of research in organogenesis, but
still have value after their scien-
tific purpose has been fulfilled.
However, the photos are never
done solely for the sake of art.
Nicole Evans, a graduate stu-
dent in the Medical School's
cell and developmental biol-
ogy department and a two-time

recipient of the travel grant,
gave insight into the process of
bioartography.
"We never stain something
with seven colors to take a bio-
artography picture," she said.
"We're taking pictures for our
research to better understand
organogenesis and development
in general, and we happen to
come across something cool. It's
never forced."
The actual method of prepar-
ing the tissues for photography
varies depending on whether
the specimen is animal (which
is transparent and needs to be
dyed) or plant (which has its
own natural pigment). For the
cells that need to be stained,
a liquid is added that contains
either chemical agents or anti-
bodies. These agents or antibod-
ies bind to the cells, infusing
them with color.
"Our favorite colors in this
context are blue, red and green,"
Gumucio said, describing the
analysis for research purposes.
"The microscopes are able to
shine just the right wavelength
of light to fluoresce the dyes."
Once a photo is taken, it may go
through a range of manipulation
effects, including color inversion
or addition. The "Van Gogh's
Skin" piece is a prime example:
The yellow streaks that create
the effect of a nighttime sky were
added to the image of basal-cell
carcinoma after the picture was
taken. Such alterations are com-
pletely aesthetic, and act only to
enhance the natural beauty that
is already present.
Once the photos have been
submitted and selected as can-
didates for being exhibited, they
are compiled into a book and
sent to various art authorities for
further consultation and selec-

tion. Smith has been a yearly fix-
ture in the process.
"If it captures my imagina-
tion, then I give ita higher rank-
ing," Smith said. "And what
focuses my imagination, for me,
is that it's got to have something
very visually interesting. There's
something about composition,
pattern, color, texture - the
form itself."
Once the year's collection has
been selected, the images are
put online, where they can be
bought as prints. However, the
most important medium for the
artwork is the Ann Arbor Art
Fairs, where the bioartography
booth is staffed with faculty and
medical students who work with
the images regularly.
"To the public ... it makes
them feel like they have a con-
nection to the science that might
be something they don't neces-
sarily understand," Evans said
of working atthe booth. "Itgives
them a connection to what we do
here."
And though the University
of Michigan is the only univer-
sity to have a specific bioartog-
raphy program, the practice of
microscopic photo art is receiv-
ing worldwide attention. Nikon
holds an annual "Small World"
contest, in which organisms,
minerals and other materials are
blown up and entered into a com-
petition - in the 2011 contest, the
top prize was for the expanded
image of an insect larva's head.
Popular Science magazine has
also been known to frequently
publish microscopic images.
These venues, along with the
University's bioartography pro-
gram, reveal the art within an
arm's length - all one has to do
is look a little bit closer.

Buster Keaton's nickname was The Great Stone Face.
The epitoCmeyof
slap,"sti~ck comedy

4

By PHILIP CONKLIN
Daily Arts Writer
In our time, so far removed
from the early days of cinema,
silent films are considered
obscure, art-house curios to be
enjoyed by serious connoisseurs.
Film aesthetics have changed so
much that the films made dur-
ing cinema's infancy may now
seem inaccessible for the average
moviegoer. But in the late teens
and early '20s of the last century,
when film was still a nascent art
form, it was entertainment for
the masses.
The period's reigning genre,
the slapstick comedy - the best of
which today are revered as high
art - were originally enjoyed by
every average Joe with a spare
nickel. One of the masters of
this early film genre was Buster
Keaton.
Of the great slapstick comedi-
ans, Buster Keaton was the fun-
niest. Whereas many films of the
time tended toward sentimental-
ity, Keaton's films were purely
and unrelentingly funny. Today,
Keaton is remembered most for
his amazing stunts, which he
performed himself - he even
sometimes did other actors'
stunts if they were too dangerous
- but he was also one of the best
directors of the silent era. And in
"Sherlock Jr.," arguably his best
film, Keaton is at the top of his
game.
"Sherlock Jr." stars Keaton as
a film projectionist who aspires
to be a great detective. The first
scene shows him sitting in the
back of the empty theater read-
ing a book called "How to be a
Detective." As in all his mov-
ies, Keaton is a hapless, ingenu-
ous but resourceful young man
with high ideals and unflappable
determination. In this film, the
object of that determination (as
in nearly every slapstick comedy)
is a beautiful ingenue, cleverly
called The Girl.
But just when Keaton's court-
ing of The Girl is starting to go
well, it all goes beautifully and
hilariously wrong. When a com-
peting courter (Ward Crane)
frames Keaton for stealing The
Girl's father's watch, the aspiring
detective decides to put his bud-
ding skills to the test.
The real fun begins when
Keaton falls asleep in his projec-
tion booth and dreams himself
into the film he is projecting. In
this dream movie, which shares
the plot and characters of his

real-life conundrum but in a
high-society setting, he is the
suave, titular Sherlock Jr., "the
best detective in the world."
In the raised stakes of the
dream movie, Keaton must solve
the crime and win The Girl,
among a melee of hulking hench-
men, high-speed car chases,
incredible death-defying stunts
and head-turningtricks.
More than anything, "Sher-
lock Jr." is a funny paragon of
slapstick comedy. The film is sat-
urated with gags, each one more
hilarious than the last. Every
second is funny, which speaks
to Keaton's ability as both a film-
maker and performer. Keaton's
nickname was The Great Stone
Face, because whatever befell
him, he always retained his
bemused expression. He relied
on nuance, transforming the
smallest gestures into brilliant
comedy.
A film, within a
film, within
a film.
But "Sherlock Jr." transcends
broad comedy. Back in 1924,
Buster Keaton was already chal-
lenging the conventions of film.
One of the best and funniest
comedies of all time, the film also
grapples with questions about
the nature of cinema - half of the
action takes place in asfilm within
the film within a dream, and this
was 86 years before "Inception."
By all accounts, "Sherlock Jr."
is way ahead of its time. It con-
tains ground-breaking special
effects: In one scene, after leav-
ing his sleeping body, Buster
walks into the film he is project-
ing - which is something Woody
Allen did 60 years later in "Pur-
ple Rose of Cairo." And Keaton's
intricately choreographed stunts,
done with the crude technology
of the time, were unparalleled
before and have been since.
Silent films represent some of
thegreatest works of cinema, and
are regretfully neglected by most
filmgoers today. These films are
not inaccessible, nor incompre-
hensible. They're fun and enter-
taining. "Sherlock Jr." is not only
one of the best of these, but also
a great gateway into that legend-
ary silent filmgenre, the slapstick
comedy.
