About 100 people gathered 

in the Ford School of Public 
Policy 
Monday 
to 
hear 

personal 
experiences 
and 

reactions to the Flint water 
crisis from a diverse group of 
panelists, including activists 
and government workers.

The 
Flint 
water 
crisis 

occurred 
after 
a 
state-

appointed 
emergency 

manager decided to cut costs 
by changing the source of 
city water to more corrosive 
sources, which caused lead 
from the pipes to leach into 
the water, poisioning Flint’s 
residents. It was not publicly 
addressed until nearly two 
years after the initial notice 
of potential lead in the the 
water.

Panelist 
Chris 
Kolb, 

president of the Michigan 
Environmental 
Council, 

started the discussion with 
comments on his work on 
Gov. Rick Snyder’s (R) Flint 
Water 
Task 
Force, 
which 

reviewed the state, federal 
and municipal actions leading 
to the crisis.

“We 
worked 
for 
five 

months to come up with the 
report,” Kolb said. “When 
we held our press conference 
in March of this year, I said 
that I thought the Flint water 

crisis was a toxic brew of 
intolerance, 
incompetence 

and ignorance.”

The report was a consensus 

document 
that 
contained 

36 findings about the crisis 
and placed the majority of 
the blame on the Michigan 
Department of Environmental 

Quality, a state government 
agency 
meant 
to 
ensure 

water and air quality are up 
to healthy standards. The 
emergency manager, Snyder 
and the ill-prepared Flint 
water treatment plant were 
also to blame for the disaster.

In an interview, Thompson 

said her research has largely led 
her to conclude that the slow 
downfall and ultimate economic 
collapse of Detroit can be traced 
back to former President Lyndon 
B. Johnson’s Law Enforcement 
Assistance Act, which, Thompson 
argues, started the so-called war 
on crime and the incentivization 
of incarceration that came with it.

“As 
important 
as 

deindustrialization and ‘white 
flight’ are, we have also given 
short shrift to the punitive turn 
the embrace of mass incarceration 
had in destroying cities like 
Detroit,” she said.

University of Michigan Housing residential advisors and other staff members hold signs that read “You Belong Here” as they gather at the final meeting point of the 
march on the Diag Monday.

About 400 University of 

Michigan Housing residential 
advisers, 
peer 
academic 

success specialists, diversity 
peer 
educators 
and 
other 

staff members participated in 
three collaborative marches 
across 
Central 
Campus, 

North Campus and the Hill 
Neighborhood 
Monday 

evening.

March participants walked 

through the community centers 
of every campus dorm in a 

stance of solidarity for dorm 
residents in light of the anti-
Black, anti-LGBTQ and anti-
Islam posters found in Mason 
and Haven Halls and current 
discussions surrounding the 
release of University President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
Diversity, 

Equity & Inclusion Plan earlier 
this month. 

Participants walked from 

dorm to dorm, holding signs 
and 
chanting 
“You 
belong 

here.”

LSA senior Kim Ellsworth, 

community 
center 
manager 

for 
West 
Quad 
Residence 

Hall, said the march was 

organized in a collaborative 
effort for dorm residents to 
feel more included on campus, 
she noted that residential life 
had been raised as an issue in 
community discussions held by 
the University around the DEI 
plan.

“We heard during the open 

forums of President Schlissel 
that students couldn’t express 
(their 
feelings) 
and 
they 

weren’t feeling safe in the 
residence halls, so we wanted 
to come together as a res staff 
to show that we’re a physical 
presence in the halls and on 
campus and show that we 

stand with our residents and 
that they belong here in our 
communities,” Ellsworth said.

Stressing 
the 
importance 

of visibility, Ellsworth said 
University Housing was not 
asking for an administrative 
response, 
but 
rather 
was 

working in support of their 
diversity strategies.

“One of the core values of 

Housing and of the University 
is to make this be a diverse and 
inclusive space for all residents 
because this is their home, 
and when they’re not in class, 
they’re at home,” Ellsworth

COSTUME PREPARATIONS. puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Though most students at 

the University of Michigan are 

long past their trick-or-treating 

days, the Halloween spirit still 

lives on — Halloween and its 

festivities now come begin a 

week before the actual holiday, 

with various events on campus 

getting students in the holiday 

mood.

This week at the University, 

there are several events slated 

to celebrate the holiday, such as 

the North Campus Haunted Bell 

Tower, a Spookappella concert, 

Halloween at the Ann Arbor 

Farmers Market and a haunted 

house hosted by Triangle 

Fraternity and Phi Sigma Rho 

sorority. 

Triangle and Phi Sigma Rho 

will host their haunted house 

Tuesday to Thursday, from 8:30 

p.m. to midnight. The Triangle 

haunted house will cost $5 at 

the door, but tickets are on 

pre-sale for $3, with donations 

going to Habitat for Humanity 

and STEMpowered Detroit.

Closer to Halloween, (g)

imble and Maize Mirchi 

will host what they call the 

spookiest A Cappella event 

of the year. The event will be 

Friday night at the Modern 

Languages Building. The 

groups will don their 

favorite costumes, sing 

festive Halloween tunes 

and introduce each group’s 

new members. Attendees 

are encouraged to wear 

costumes.

Then, on Saturday, the 

Ann Arbor Farmers Market 

will host “Halloween at the 

Market.” Guests can dress 

up in costumes, go trick-or-

treating and play themed 

games. At the event, Beyond 

the Diag will be offering 

free donuts and cider from 9 

a.m. to 10 a.m.

To cap off a weekend 

full of Halloween festivities, 

the Haunted Bell Tower on 

North Campus, which will be 

decorated for Halloween, will 

take place from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. 

on Monday, Oct. 31 and students 

will be able to enter the Bell 

Tower at no cost.

Whether you attend all 

these events, wear a costume 

all week long or just eat 

some candy, there’s plenty of 

Halloween spirit to go around 

this week.

crime control programs and 
initiatives by providing grants for 
training officers and improving 
incarceration conditions.

Thompson said her work points 

to the origin of the war on crime 
stemming from not only racism 
based in the southern United 
States, but also a mentality many 
white northerners held during 
the Civil Rights Movement.

“To many white Detroiters, the 

mere presence of so many more 
African Americans in the wake of 
the Second Great Migration, who 
were vocal about their need for 
an equal share of civil resources, 
was 
threatening, 
dangerous 

and even criminal,” Thompson 
said. “White southerners, both 
ordinary citizens and elected 
officials, had long equated Civil 
Rights unrest with criminality, 
and when African Americans 
began fighting for greater equality 
in the North as much as in the 
South, this is how northern whites 
began to interpret their actions as 
well.”

While 
many 
researchers 

argue that the war on crime was 

instituted in reaction to increasing 
homicide and violent crime rates, 
Thompson said she thinks this is 
misleading, if not blatantly untrue.

“The murder rate had been 

far higher in the 1930s — as high 
as 9.7 per 100,000,” she said. 
“Indeed, if one looks at the entire 
20th century, it is remarkable 
how much safer the 1960s were 
compared to previous decades.”

Thompson argued that because 

federal funding is allocated by 
need, Detroit had an incentive to 
boost crime figures, resulting in 
a much more aggressive form of 
policing than Detroit had seen 
prior to the War on Crime.

“Thanks to the intensified 

criminalization of urban space 
in the 1970s and 1980s, today, 
Michigan’s 
prison 
population 

has increased by (53.8) percent,” 
Thompson said.

This increase in the prison 

population has had a significant 
social impact on Detroit, including 
the orphaning of many of Detroit’s 
children, Thompson said.

“According 
to 
the 
Pew 

Foundation and the Osborne 
Society, by 2010, more than 2.7 
million children in the United 
States had a parent in prison and 
approximately 10 million had a 

parent who had been incarcerated 
at some point in their childhood,” 
Thompson said.

“This 
experience 
fell 

disproportionately on children of 
color, with one in nine African-
American kids experiencing this 
trauma compared to one in 57 
white kids (with parents who have 
been in prison),” she added.

Increased 
incarceration 

rates have had deep economic 
consequences as well, making it 
almost impossible for a formerly 
convicted person to find a steady 
source of legal income, according 
to Thompson.

“Not 
only 
did 
employers 

routinely require them to reveal 
whether they had a criminal 
record, but employers also made 
clear that they were unlikely 
to hire anyone who had been 
convicted of a crime,” Thompson 
said.

Ultimately, Thompson said, 

the 
profitability 
of 
private 

prisons in Michigan is one of 
the greater causes of Detroit’s 
economic 
collapse 
and 
has 

played a tremendous role in the 
deindustrialization in the former 
manufacturing city.

However, she added that not 

only does the private sector 
have culpability fror the prison 
industry, but the government does 
as well.

“Detroiters lost jobs not just 

because companies moved their 
work 
and 
consumers 
moved 

their purchasing dollars into 
Michigan’s 
prisons, 
but 
also 

because the state was investing 
more money in building prisons 
than in building or incentivizing 
factories in the free world that 
would, in turn, employ free-world 
workers,” she said.

While Detroit’s recent history 

is 
complex, 
Thompson 
said 

continuing to conduct research 
like hers will help the state and 
the 
country 
understand 
the 

broader needs of the city and the 
roots of the unjust practices that 
have taken place.

“Ultimately, Detroit suffered 

much economic fallout from a 
now 
almost 
five-decades-long 

War on Crime, and if we really 
are to understand the dire fate of 
this city, we must understand the 
hidden as well as visible costs of 
the dramatic punitive turn we 
took as a nation in the wake of the 
Civil Rights ‘60s,” Thompson said.

deadline on Oct. 11, 90 percent 
of 
respondents 
said 
they 

registered to vote. Various 
groups on campus have worked 
to register voters throughout 
the semester, including the 
University’s 
chapters 
of 

College Democrats and College 
Republicans — college students 
typically 
register 
at 
lower 

rates.

The survey also asked if 

state and federal congressional 
races are as important as the 
presidential election, to which 
79 
percent 
of 
respondents 

answered “definitely yes” or 
“probably yes.”

LSA 
junior 
Enrique 

Zalamea, president of College 
Republicans, 
wrote 
in 
an 

email that his organization 
has been working to promote 
conservative candidates up and 
down the ballot to encourage 
student voting.

“Since 
September, 
we’ve 

been actively volunteering in 
campaigns for congressmen 
and 
state 
representatives,” 

Zalamea 
wrote. 
“We 

continuously 
encourage 

everyone to do the same and 
to make the effort to vote for 
your Republican congressional 
candidates regardless of your 
opinion on our presidential 
candidate.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, 

chair of College Democrats, 
also stressed the importance 
of congressional races, saying 
having a Republican Congress 
with a Democratic executive 
has been a barrier to passing 
legislation 
these 
past 
few 

years.

“Congressional 
races 
are 

more difficult to get excited for 
and are not covered nearly as 
thoroughly as the presidential 
election, but if we want to 
actually see the progressive 
change 
Secretary 
Clinton 

is advocating, it’s essential 
Democrats take back the House 
and Senate,” Kelly said.

The lack of change among 

students comes among recent 
incidents in both the Trump 
and 
Clinton 
campaigns 
— 

including a leaked tape of 
Trump making references to 
touching women without their 
consent and hacked emails from 
the Clinton campaign featuring 
controversial statements about 
various voting demographics — 

stems to indicate they have not 
heavily impacted support on 
campus.

In 
questions 
about 
the 

incidents 
specifically, 
47 

percent of respondents reported 
that scandals associated with 
Clinton impacted their views 
and 46 percent of respondents 
reported 
that 
scandals 

associated 
with 
Trump 

changed their views.

Kelly said he found Trump’s 

leaked comments about women, 
compounded by accusations 
from multiple women that 
allege he sexually assaulted 
them made after the tape’s 
release, are more noteworthy 
than Clinton’s email hack. He 
called the WikiLeaks situation 
a “non-scandal” that points to 
momentary carelessness rather 
than incompetence or danger, 
saying this could be why 
student support for Clinton 
remained unchanged. Zalamea 
did not respond to a question 
about Clinton and Trump’s 
comments.

“(Students) knew who the 

candidates were and what they 
stood for before these came 
out, and all the news recently 
has simply confirmed that,” 
Kelly said.

said. “So it’s really important 
for us to show support for 
them; it’s important that we 
have a physical presence and 
we’re doing the most we can to 
outreach to all of our res staff 
and all of our residents.”

Business graduate student 

Zelin Wang, a residential staff 
coordinator, said the event 
was organized last week in a 
University Housing meeting 

with the goal of being timely, 
active 
and 
engaging 
for 

residence hall staff to connect 
with residents.

“We’re 
responding 
to 
a 

lot of the events on campus 
that 
have 
been 
happening 

recently with the flyering,” 
Wang said. “Also, a lot of the 
political 
climate 
nationally 

is also making a lot of our 
residents feel unwelcome and 
not necessarily accepted here. 
With any larger organization 
like University Housing it can 
be easy to get bogged down or 

not necessarily know how to 
meet the demands in a timely 
fashion, and for this event we 
really wanted to act as swiftly 
as possible.”

LSA 
junior 
Kate 
Vogel, 

residential staff coordinator at 
Martha Cook Residence Hall, 
said she felt the event went 
well and hopes her residents 
feel a safe sense of community.

“First and foremost, we are 

here for our residents,” Vogel 
said. “We as representatives 
of Housing wanted to find a 
way that would let all of our 

residents in all of the dorms 
on campus to know that we are 
here to support them and all 
of the different identities and 
diversity within our campus in 
light of recent campus events.”

“In times like this, it’s so 

important not to stay silent 
and to come together,” Vogel 
said.

Event organizers said they 

were not sure if there would be 
similar marches in the future.

Kolb said the report also 

highlighted 
the 
broader 

issues 
of 
environmental 

injustice that led to the crisis, 
including 
the 
purposeful 

refusal to involve residents in 
making government decisions 
regarding 
environmental 

policy laws.

E. Hill De Loney, executive 

director of the Flint Odyssey 
House 
Health 
Awareness 

Center, 
echoed 
Kolb’s 

sentiments, 
saying 
the 

government 
still 
is 
failing 

to work with the people of 
Flint in resolving the water 
crisis. Hill De Loney said 
despite complaints of tainted 
water from many of the city’s 
residents, 60 percent of whom 
are Black, state officials did 
not listen until a white person 
spoke up.

“When we talk about what 

has happened in Flint, racism 
as it relates to the water 
crisis in Flint is the elephant 
in the room,” Hill De Loney 
said. “However, it is also the 
elephant in America.”

She 
said 
many 
citizens 

of Flint did not want an 
emergency manager, yet one 
was appointed and residents 
were subsequently excluded 
from important talks by city 
officials on how to handle the 
crisis. 

“There wasn’t too much trust 

in the first place but when that 
happened, I cannot tell you 

how deeply mistrust became a 
cancer in our community,” Hill 
De Loney said. “We don’t trust 
anything they tell us.”

Nayyirah Shariff, co-founder 

of the Flint Democracy Defense 
League, reemphasized that the 
people of Flint distrust the local 
officials tasked with fixing 
the crisis. She said citizens of 
foreign countries were even 
calling family members in Flint 

and warning them not to drink 
the water.

“Those 
of 
you 
who 

understand intimate partner 
violence, this really feels like 
a violent relationship, because 
the state is responsible for 
poisoning us, and now the state 
is in charge of our recovery,” 
Shariff said.

Kent Key, director of the 

Office of Community Scholars 
and Partnerships at Michigan 
State University’s College of 
Human Medicine and another 
panelist, connected his work 
in 
vetting 
the 
numerous 

researchers entering Flint to 
the University of Michigan 
community in his talk. He 
has created the Healthy Flint 
Research Coordinating Center, 
which was funded by both the 
University of Michigan and 
Michigan State University as 
a way to encourage an ethical 
and respectable community, as 
well as academic partnerships.

“One thing is to really start 

some 
dialogue, 
start 
some 

conversations,” Key said. “The 
racial climate in this country is 
something I have never seen in 
my lifetime before.”

an internet-based white nationalist 
movement.

LSA freshman Kori Thomas first 

noticed the posters at around 11 a.m. 
on Friday and tweeted out photos to 
show other students the fliers being 
displayed on campus.

“At first, when I saw those fliers, 

I was shocked,” Thomas said. “I 
thought that we were done with 
those after last month’s incident. I 
wanted to get the photos out there 
for others to see. After that though, I 
was just mad.”

In 
total, 
seven 
fliers 
were 

discovered and posted to social 
media, including one that was 
previously posted around campus 
last month.

Following the initial discovery 

of anti-Black fliers on campus in 
September, students held protests 
around the school, drawing more 
than 400 students and calling for the 
University to take more immediate 
action to resolve issues of campus 
climate. Administrators released a 
statement condemning the posters 
soon after, and University President 
Mark Schlissel hosted a forum six 
days later to further discuss the 
impact the posters had on students.

In response to Thomas’s tweet of 

the posters on Friday, dozens of alt-
right supporters and sympathizers 
responded 
directly 
with 
racial 

epithets and insults. Some responses 
also targeted Schlissel with anti-
Semitic language.

Earlier this month, the University 

launched a campus-wide Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion initiative 
that aims to increase diverse 
representation on campus through 
institutional 
initiatives 
and 

discussion. In an interview with The 
Michigan Daily in October, Schlissel 
noted the importance of campus 
engagement to resolve issues of 
people hanging up offensive posters.

“Regarding the episodes of the 

posters, on multiple occasions, 
we’ve got no eyewitnesses, we don’t 
have video, so (finding the people 
responsible) will be very difficult,” 
Schlissel said. “But in a sense, this 
is something that students can 
help us with as well. In that you all, 

collectively, are the eyes and ears of 
the campus. And if this is offensive, 
as it is to almost everybody, if not 
everybody, then keep your eyes 
open. If you see someone putting 
something up and you look at its 
content, now you are an eyewitness 
to something that is offensive to a 
large faction of our community, and 
you should speak up.”

LSA sophomore Carly Marten 

said she also noticed an anti-Islamic 
poster that characterized the New 
Year’s assaults in Cologne, Germany 
as a “brutal mass rape” on the 
concrete pillar at the corner of State 
Street and North University Avenue 
Friday morning.

“When I saw the poster at North 

University and State Street, I was 
so upset and mad,” Marten said. 
“So I took a photo, sent it to some 
on-campus activists I knew and then 
tore it down.”

Only minutes later, Marten, 

who 
is 
a 
supporter 
of 
the 

#BlackLivesMatter movement, saw 
another poster that contained an 
infographic titled “What does the 
alt-right want?” on a concrete pillar 
outside of the Chemistry Building. 
Immediately she photographed it 
and contacted local BLM activists.

“When I saw the posters, some 

guys kind of heckled me outside the 
Chemistry Building,” she said. “My 
emotional reaction was just shocked 
and angry, even though I am not a 
member of the attacked group.”

Following the initial reporting 

of the flyering, The Michigan 
Daily 
reached 
out 
to 
several 

Students4Justice 
campaign 

members, who declined to comment. 

After being informed of the 

incident by the Daily, LSA senior 
David Schafer, president of Central 
Student Government, wrote in 
an email interview that the fliers 
were contrary to the values of the 
University.

“Again, we are confronted with 

the presence of racist and white 
supremacist flyers on our campus,” 
Schafer wrote. “This is a perversion 
of the fundamental values on which 
this university rests. Let us all 
stand tall — and stand in solidarity 
with the targeted communities. 
Our commitment to truly serving 
as allies requires us to back up our 
words with concrete actions.”

The University of Michigan’s 

Residential College hosted a 

discussion on issues of criminal 

justice, incarceration and drug 

addiction Monday evening.

The event featured married 

couple Graham MacIndoe and 

Susan Stellin, authors of a recent 

memoir titled “Chancers: Addition, 

Prison, Recovery, Love” which 

focuses on MacIndoe’s decade-long 

struggle with heroin addiction, his 

experiences in New York City and 

Homeland Security-run prisons and 

Stellin’s efforts in navigating the 

complex criminal justice system.

Stellin began the discussion by 

reading a passage from the book that 

describes the night in 2006 when 

MacIndoe was arrested in Brooklyn 

for misdemeanor drug possession. 

For more than a day, Stellin had to 

travel between numerous New York 

City jails to obtain information on 

MacIndoe’s whereabouts and the 

nature of his arrest.

MacIndoe talked about the 

humiliation of being strip-searched 

in a Brooklyn jail and his anxiety that 

night about how the arrest would 

impact his future. He went on to 

describe the physically and mentally 

taxing time he spent at Rikers Island, 

a New York City prison complex 

notorious for abuse of prisoners by 

guards, unsanitary and overcrowded 

conditions and the large amount 

of people held there without being 

convicted for a crime, as detailed in a 

2014 article in The New York Times.

However, MacIndoe was a 

citizen of the United Kingdom at the 

time his of arrest, which captured 

the attention of the Department 

of Homeland Security and led to 

his transfer from Rikers Island to 

a Homeland Security detention 

center in rural Pennsylvania. While 

MacIndoe described life at Rikers as 

bleak and difficult, his experience as 

an inmate in Pennsylvania was to be 

much tougher.

“They whisked me to 

immigration detention, which, as 

Susan said, was so dehumanizing 

and devastating to me,” MacIndoe 

said. “I used to lie in my bunk at the 

Homeland Security detention center 

and fantasize about being back at 

Rikers because as rough and tough 

and crazy as Rikers was, I had a job 

and I could go out in the yard and I 

got good meals, but in immigration 

detention I got none of that.”

For Stellin, one of the most 

difficult parts of MacIndoe’s 

detention was the lack of 

transparency about his legal 

status. She said a large number of 

legal documents she and a lawyer 

assembled for him were never 

delivered and money that was 

put in his commissary account 

“mysteriously disappeared.”

“What really horrified me was 

how quickly all of this happened and 

how little contact he was allowed to 

have,” Stellin said.

MacIndoe said he was lucky he 

had friends and family who supported 

him in his legal case and battles with 

addiction after being released. Many 

at Rikers Island and in the American 

criminal justice system do not have 

this type of support, he said.

“The thing is that many of them 

are stuck in there for long, long 

periods but they can’t afford bail, and 

bail is not that much sometimes, but 

people live in poverty and can’t pay 

it,” MacIndoe said. “We shouldn’t 

be spending our money on keeping 

people locked up at Rikers Island 

because they can’t afford a 500-dollar 

bail for weeks, months or years on 

end.”

Ypsilanti Township resident Amy 

Atwell, who attended the event, said 

the detailed account of MacIndoe’s 

struggles with drug addiction, his 

subsequent arrest and Stellin’s efforts 

just in locating where MacIndoe was 

sent in the city showed strength of 

character.

“What struck me initially was 

how brave both the addict, Graham, 

and his spouse were, because she is 

the support to a person who is dealing 

with an illness that does not go away,” 

Atwell said.

LSA sophomore Chanelle Miles 

said MacIndoe and Stellin’s account 

resonated with her on a personal 

level, as she has seen people she 

knows locked up or dealing with the 

stigma of having a criminal record 

upon release.

“The one and most important 

thing is that even though he was on 

Rikers Island and it seems so far away 

from here, it touches so close to home 

as I am African American, I come 

from a community that is urban and 

I come from a community where the 

majority of my friends and my family 

members know people who have 

been incarcerated,” Miles said. “He 

went through his different trials and 

tribulations, but even through his 

trials and tribulations, I could see my 

friends and I could see my uncle and 

their stories.”

Residential College holds talk on drug addiction

Authors discuss recent memoir on struggle with heroin use, imprisonment


Content Warning: This column 
contains 
explicit 
language 

about sexual assault.
S

everal years ago, I was 
sitting in a hot tub with 
five or six friends. As the 

night wore on, a few of them 
went inside, one and two at a 
time, until I was alone in water 
with a friend of a 
friend. 
We 
were 

kissing, but I wasn’t 
interested in going 
any further. He went 
much further than I 
wanted to, telling me 
to “hold on” after I 
told him to stop and 
tried to push myself 
away from him.

For three years, 

I didn’t tell anyone 
that I had been assaulted. I kept 
it from my parents, doctors and 
closest friends. My Catholic 
upbringing taught me not to 
have sex before marriage, and 
believe it or not, that’s exactly 
what I planned to do. I felt 
ashamed that I’d been unable 
to make him stop, and naive for 
having trusted him enough to 
allow myself to be alone with 
him in the hot tub. All I wanted 
was to forget it ever happened.

Of course, I didn’t. While I’m 

fortunate to have had the support 
necessary to move past what was 
without question the worst night 
of my life, I’ll never be able to 
unlive it. Research suggests that 
one in five women and one in 71 
men experience sexual assault at 
least once. Those individuals will 
never unlive it either.

Our 
legal 
and 
criminal 

justice systems contribute to 
the problem by allowing an 
estimated 97 percent of accused 
rapists to escape conviction. 
And those who are convicted? 
Many receive far less than 
the maximum 14-year prison 
sentence. Data from 2009 shows 
that of 84 percent of convicted 
rapists sentenced to prison, five 
percent go to jail and 11 percent 
recieved probation or “other.” 

I’m not interested in raising 

my future children in a world 
where this heinous crime occurs 
with such appalling frequency. 
I don’t want my friends — or 
strangers for that matter — to live 
in constant fear of spiked drinks 
and strange men hiding behind 
bushes, waiting to grab them 
when they’re walking home at 
night. I’d like to think that most 
of you don’t want that either.

Over the past few years, our 

country has made considerable 
strides 
on 
this 
issue. 
The 

national “It’s On Us” campaign 
— 
whose 
powerful 
backers 

include the White House, the 
U.S. Olympic Committee and 

MTV parent company Viacom 
Media Networks — has raised 
awareness 
about 
the 
issue 

on 
college 
campuses 
across 

the country, including ours. 
California became the first state 
to pass an affirmative consent 
law, and several others enacted 
legislation to help prevent sexual 

assaults 
on 
college 

campuses.

One 
man 
has 

already 
begun 

to 
unravel 
the 

progress 
achieved 

by 
women’s 
safety 

advocates at every 
level of government: 
Republican 
presidential nominee 
Donald 
Trump, 

the 
first 
major 

party candidate to have been 
accused before the primary 
of sexual assault in formal 
court documents from three 
different lawsuits, including an 
ongoing civil case alleging he 
tied a 13-year-old to a bed and 
raped her. 

Despite 
his 
transparent 

awfulness, 
Trump 
has 
the 

power to influence millions of 
his supporters whether or not 
he actually wins the presidency. 
Trump’s words are dangerous for 
the simple reason that leaders’ 
consequences 
have 
actions. 

Diminishing 
boastful 
claims 

that he can grab women “by the 
pussy” without consent as mere 
“locker room talk” runs the risk 
of normalizing the criminal 
behavior he described.

In interviews with Politico, 

several 
Trump 
supporters 

defended Trump’s words in the 
video as they way “real men 
talk”; one 17-year-old said that 
“Trump’s 
comments 
weren’t 

predatory because they let him 
do it because he’s a star, and that 
is a form of consent,” according 
to the article. It’s possible that 
these words were born out of 
pure loyalty to the candidate. 
But it’s equally likely — perhaps 
more so — that these are the true 
attitudes that some hold.

As 
just 
one 
example 
of 

Trump’s influence on those 
closest to him, his own son told 
radio listeners that Trump’s 
“grab 
her 
by 
the 
pussy” 

comments were simply a “fact 
of life.”

Reducing the prevalence of 

sexual assault requires that more 
— not fewer — American men 
recognize it as the serious crime 
that it is. It also requires a social 
and legal environment where 
women can come forward with 
the reasonable expectation that 
she and her accusations will be 
taken seriously. Trump has made 
this unlikely as well.

After 
the 
now-famous 

“grab her by the pussy” video 
was released, 11 women came 
forward claiming that Trump 
sexually assaulted or harassed 
them. 
Trump 
responded 

by personally attacking the 
women’s 
characters 
and 

appearances. 
He 
defended 

himself against one woman’s 
claims 
by 
saying 
that 
she 

wouldn’t be his “first choice” 
to sexually assault. He told the 
American public that the women 
were manipulative liars, part 
of a media scheme to “rig” the 
election against him — despite 
the fact that several witnesses 
claimed that wasn’t the case.

When the women refused 

to 
recant 
their 
statements, 

Trump announced to cheering 
supporters that he would sue 
each woman who accused him 
of assault. He also threatened 
to sue The New York Times for 
publishing articles about the 
women’s allegations.

To be clear, these aren’t likely 

to be very successful lawsuits. 
Even still, the media coverage 
surrounding Trump’s threatened 
lawsuits 
could 
create 
the 

misconception that survivors of 
sexual assault could face legal 
action against them if they come 
forward about their experiences 
or report the crime to police. 
In the eyes of some of his 
supporters, this might actually 
be a good thing.

In a few weeks, voters will 

have the opportunity to seize 
Trump’s national soapbox by 
electing 
his 
opponent. 
Both 

the polls and election-betting 
markets strongly suggest that 
voters will seize this opportunity.

But a Clinton victory will 

not be sufficient to undo the 
damage 
Trump’s 
campaign 

has inflicted on the legitimacy 
of sexual assault as a serious 
crime and on survivors as 
people to support and believe.

When it’s all said and done, 

millions of voters will not believe 
Hillary Clinton was rightfully 
elected, even if Trump loses. 
Trump will still be a leader to 
some of those people, and his 
words will still have value.

I still want my children to 

inherit a world devoid of sexual 
violence, and I still think it’s 
possible. It will require years of 
education, advocacy and criminal 
justice reform. But perhaps the 
best first step toward combatting 
the vehement, baseless rhetoric 
Trump spreads is to simply 
be louder than the pervasive 
coverage of the campaign.

The prowess of the lamestream media

ROLAND DAVIDSON | COLUMN

I 

have a deep self-destructive 
streak, which is why I often 
add myself to Tea Party 

Facebook groups. These groups 
are 
wonderlands 
of 
people 

totally 
unironically 
sharing 

National Inquirer articles, and 
conspiracy theories 
that 
Michelle 

Obama is actually 
a trans woman and 
that 
Obama 
will 

declare martial law 
any day now. To be 
clear, none of this is 
exaggeration. What 
binds these Facebook 
posts together is the 
persistent complaint 
that the mainstream 
media (itself a nebulous term) 
is not covering these “issues.” 
I often see a similar complaint 
from the left, that mainstream 
journalism 
doesn’t 
cover 

issues (note the lack of scare 
quotes) as well as they should. 
However, neither critique really 
holds water once one critically 
examines the relationship that 
consumers of news and niche 
news organizations have with 
mainstream media.

After ISIS agents killed 130 

people in France last November, 
many 
progressives 
begun 

criticizing 
the 
“mainstream 

news media” for not properly 
covering 
terroristic 
violence 

in non-Western countries like 
the bombing in Beirut, which 
happened 
a 
day 
prior 
and 

claimed over 40 lives. I could 
rationalize 
the 
discrepancy 

and come up with reasonable 
justifications, such as the fact 
that a terrorist attack in France 

is more concerning to American 
audiences than one in Lebanon 
since the former could portend 
violence here. But all of this 
is 
irrelevant 
because 
these 

maligned news outlets actually 
did an excellent job covering 

these terrorist attacks, 
giving them plenty 
of airtime and page 
space. What I believe 
is going on here is that 
people didn’t know 
about these issues and 
instead of owning up 
to 
their 
ignorance, 

they made the claim 
that the media had 
failed to educate them.

A 
similarly 

common 
critique 
is 
that 

the 
news 
media 
“rigged” 

the election against Bernie 
Sanders because they denied 
him essential coverage during 
the primary. This simply isn’t 
the case. A report by Harvard’s 
Shorenstein Center confirmed 
that though he may have gotten 
a third of the coverage Clinton 
received, he also had the most 
positive coverage out of all 
candidates, 
averaging 
50.5 

percent more positive news 
coverage than his competitor. 
However, liberal media outlets 
chose to ignore that part of 
the report, instead printing 
headlines like “Harvard Study 
Confirms Bernie Sanders Was 
Right: Media Blackout Badly 
Hurt Campaign” and then not 
bothering to go into the story 
on a deeper level. You can’t 
have your big media conspiracy 
go both ways.

Part of the issue with these 

critiques of mainstream media 
is that these critics are people 
who don’t even bother to glance 
at, say, The New York Times. 
Many 
progressives 
claimed 

that The New York Times didn’t 
even bother covering the Dakota 
Access 
pipeline, 
a 
pipeline 

that would run through miles 
of Sioux land. Lo and behold, 
on Aug. 24, 2016, the Dakota 
pipeline is on The New York 
Times’ front page. I would add 
that the Anti-Media article I 
linked to was actually published 
on the 25th, lending further 
credence to my belief that those 
critical of mainstream media 
don’t even bother looking at it.

Explicitly 
liberal 
news 

sources don’t have the same 
vested interest in presenting 
balanced media coverage as 
The New York Times because 
websites like Democracy Now! 
specifically cater toward a 
niche audience, much in the 
same way that Fox News does. 
These leftist journalist outfits 
don’t 
bother 
interviewing 

government officials or people 
building the pipeline so they 
can churn out the stories faster. 
The process of creating fair and 
balanced media has cleaved 
against our society’s desire 
for faster and faster news such 
that taking time to properly 
research a story has become 
perceived as media blackout.

Support scholarships for Syrian refugees
I 

wake up in my room and 
I close my eyes, trying to 
go back to sleep as the sun 

shines through my windows. 
In a state neither quite asleep 
nor awake, I hear the sound of 
a plane. Instantly, I am awake. 
All I can hear is the sound 
of the plane, and 
it’s coming closer. 
Nothing will happen, 
I reassure myself. 
This sound brings 
me back to Jordan 
and Syria, and all the 
individuals I met this 
summer who fled the 
brutal civil war, now 
going into its sixth 
year. I sit up in my 
bed and immediately 
turn toward the window. All 
I can focus on is the sound of 
the engine nearing my house. 
Nothing will happen, I say. 
There is nothing you can do, the 
refugees would say. I sit helpless 
in my bed and wait, my eyes 
on the sky. I am transported, 
if only for a second, back to 
Jordan, to the stories that I 
was told while living there, 
many revolving around what 
the sound of a plane evokes for 
those who fled rebel-held areas 
in Syria, where bombs would be 
dropped on civilian areas. The 
sound of a plane consumes you, 
the refugees would say; you look 
to the sky and follow the plane 
with your eyes, and wait to see 
if you are spared this time. It is 
an anthem of death, our anthem, 
they would say. At this moment, 
I am thinking of Amira, a Syrian 
girl whom I tutor over Skype. 
Amira, upon hearing the sound 
of a plane fly by (even though 
she was granted asylum in 
Canada) hysterically bursts into 
tears and shakes uncontrollably 
as she is reminded of the horror 
she witnessed. But, as expected, 
as I sit in my small town 1,000 
miles away, the low-flying plane 
is already gone.

Once you cross a border, 

everything changes. This is 
what the refugees I met this 
summer in Jordan would say 
to me. Here, lives are valued, a 
plane isn’t dropping bombs and 
I am already asleep. I am here. 
The sound of a plane means 
nothing to people here anyway, 
I remind myself.

While studying for midterms 

this past week, did you have a 
safe place to study? Access to 
Internet? A teacher to email 
to ask pre-exam questions? 
Did you fear an end to your 
education? Were you confident 
that school was going to begin 
again on Wednesday? I ask 

these questions only because 
it is important to realize that 
the very environment we find 
ourselves in, one that allows 
safety and security and is 
conducive to our ability to study, 
is one we take for granted. The 
normalcy of what we experience 

is 
something 

unavailable to many 
individuals 
around 

the world. As we 
posit 
ourselves 
as 

“Leaders 
and 
the 

Best,” and recognize 
our unique position 
to 
assist, 
stand 

with 
and 
support 

disadvantaged people 
throughout 
the 

world, we must also 

take a look at the importance 
of education and what it can 
do. While we are empowered 
by virtue of our education, let 
us pass on the opportunity of 
a world-renowned education 
to also empower others. This 
is why I am calling on Central 
Student Government to support 
fully funded scholarships for 
Syrian refugees, as proposed in 
a resolution this Tuesday by the 
Books Not Bombs campaign.

The impact of the Syrian 

Civil War on education has been 
disastrous. After five continuous 
years of civil war, the conflict in 
Syria has reversed more than a 
decade of progress in children’s 
education. Today, 2.2 million of 
Syria’s 4.8 million school-age 
children are not in school as a 
result of the conflict.

Since the start of the war 

over 4,000 schools throughout 
Syria have been devastated, 
damaged 
or 
converted 
into 

shelters for those displaced. If 
they are able to attend school, 
many students are stopped from 
accessing education. They are 
physically attacked for trying 
to go to school, under threat of 
having their school bombed, and 
commonly find themselves in the 

crossfire of snipers. Under the 
United Nations Convention of 
the Rights of Child, the right to 
a quality education is guaranteed 
to 
all 
children. 
Under 
the 

continuing civil war, children 
and students our age are being 
denied a basic human right.

As students who have made a 

promise to ourselves and to the 
University of Michigan to use 
our education to contribute to a 
more just and equitable society, 
will we stay silent in the face of 
the worst humanitarian crisis 
the world has ever seen? The 
answer has never been clearer. 
If we truly believe in the power 
of an education to transform 
the lives of individuals, and if 
we truly believe education to 
be the basis of the betterment 
of society, we must stand by 
our commitment of education 
 

for all. We must remember 
that we are here by luck. By 
chance, we found ourselves 
not in the midst of a civil war; 
by chance we can achieve our 
dreams. We are the lucky ones; 
we get to continue our lives as 
normal simply because we are 
here. If we are “Leaders and 
the Best,” let us as students 
collectively come together to 
ask our University to provide 
educational 
opportunities 
to 

individuals 
who 
have 
been 

displaced, and whose education 
has been interrupted by a 
conflict they found themselves 
embedded within by no fault of 
their own. It is time, and it is 
long overdue, to place Michigan 
among the ranks of the many 
other universities that have 
been 
offering 
fully 
funded 

scholarships to Syrian refugees.

Many in the world have risked 

being dangerously complacent 
about the Syrian humanitarian 
crisis. Those who have lost the 
opportunity of education risk 
becoming a lost generation in 
our lifetime. Let us be among 
those who stand up and make 
our voices heard in this time of 
deafening 
silence. 
Education 

knows 
no 
borders 
and 
no 

ethnicity; it is a human right and 
one we must support by offering 
scholarships to Syrian refugees. 

You can support the Books 

Not Bombs campaign to support 
scholarships for Syrian Refugees 
as an individual here, and as a 
student group here.

Does anyone want to hear 

Drake, the rapper pop star whose 
hit song, “One Dance,” is the most 
streamed song ever on Spotify 
and Apple Music, complain that 
the rap game is “all lies” and “all 
filthy?” Apparently so, because on 
Sunday, October 23rd, on the eve 
of Drake’s 30th birthday, he used 
his OVOSoundRadio show to pre-
miere a new song on which he pro-
fesses those exact grievances, and 
two hours later he was trending 
on Twitter, enjoying five times the 
number of mentions as any NFL 
team.

“Two Birds, One Stone” is one 

of four songs that were released 
during the broadcast and it fea-
tures one of those rare, reflective 
monologue verses that spill out 
of Drake every year or so (think 
“5AM In Toronto,” “The Ride” or 
“30 For 30”). Its beat is airy with 
minimalist drums and Drake’s 
tone is conversational, like he’s 
merely clearing his head, help-
less to a natural rhyme scheme. 
Some of the song’s three-minute 
verse sounds sincere, such as 
Drake’s acknowledgment that he’s 
indebted to a higher being or his 
reminiscing on his parents’ rela-
tionship, but other parts, particu-
larly his attacks on other rappers 
and basking in his success, are 
tacky and too familiar.

Still, “Two Birds, One Stone” 

is an exciting song that features 

Drake’s most technically impres-
sive rap verse of the year. The 
other new songs — one of which is 
a remix, not an original — are less 
personal and more pop-aimed, 
but equally solid. “Fake Love” is a 
bouncy sing-song in obvious par-
allel to “Hotline Bling” and “Snea-
kin,” which features 21 Savage, 
Atlanta’s most recent trap music 
titan, is guaranteed to be a speak-
er-shaking, strip club anthem. 
“Wanna Know (Remix)” lets 
Drake exercise his softer style and 
spotlights Dave, an emcee from 
London who has already earned 
attention from the endorsement.

There is no room to debate 

Drake’s ability to make hits, but 
his formula for going viral — an 
exclusive contract with Apple 
Music, partnerships with rela-
tively underground artists who 
are about to explode and disses 
directed at other celebrities to stir 
up extra attention — is starting 
to seem a little bit “extra.” Drake 
employed the same strategy last 
summer, using a string of singles 
to distract from allegations that 
he doesn’t write his own lyrics, 
and his latest album, Views, is the 
magnum opus of Apple Music’s 
marketing schemes. I don’t need 
another masterminded assault by 
Drake on hip-hop’s Top 40. I want 
innovation and progress from the 
world’s best-selling artist.

On the hook for “Fake Love,” 

Drake whines about fake people 
who are showing fake love to 
him, straight up to his face, and 

on “Sneakin,” he boasts “I don’t 
need love, I’m the G.O.A.T. / I just 
hit the beat and float.” The lyrics 
are ironically hollow for an emcee 
of such high esteem, especially as 
he attempts to regain some of hip-
hop’s respect after sinking into a 
bubblegum pop vacuum. Drake 
songs are typically the most excit-
ing releases in the rap sphere, but 
he’s starting to get monotonous. 
He makes me feel like a naive con-
sumer.

Drake began the action-packed 

episode of OVOSoundRadio by 
announcing his new project, More 
Life, which is due out this Decem-
ber and has been deemed a “play-
list” despite the fact that it will 
feature original music. Some of the 
songs that he played on-air will be 
a part of the project, but it was also 
described as having been made 
“with the fam,” so it’s expected 
to feature Drake’s friends, such 
as Kanye West and Gucci Mane, 
or label-mates like Majid Jordan, 
dvsn and Roy Wood$.

More Life will surely shock 

aux chords everywhere, prolong 
Drake’s reign atop the charts and 
inspire more Apple Music sub-
scriptions, but hopefully it does 
more than stack sure-thing hits. 
When Drake released “Marvin’s 
Room” in 2011, or “Hold On, We’re 
Going Home” in 2013, he was tak-
ing risks that left him vulnerable 
and pushing creative boundaries. 
Right now, it seems like he is mere-
ly repeating a proven recipe. That 
tactic will only work for so long.

Rapper/pop star debuts new songs, but seems stuck in the same recipe

Let’s get one thing straight: 

Technology isn’t all that bad. 
Yes, in the age of reality televi-
sion, social media, 
virtual reality and 
computer 
hack-

ing, 
technology 

has proven to be 
taking control of 
our 
world, 
one 

gadget and app 
at a time. But for 
the 
most 
part, 

many of the 21st 
century’s techno-
logical innovations — the iPod, 
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and 
music streaming services — have 
influenced our awareness of the 
world, broadening our minds to 
new realms and endless oppor-
tunities that were once believed 
to be impossible. In a sense, tech-
nology has cultivated a paradox: 
we are more connected than 
we’ve ever been, and yet there 
remains a visible disconnect 
among society.

This 
unnerving 
conflict 

serves as the thematic core of 
“Black Mirror,” the popular 
British anthology series that 
has been deemed by many crit-
ics and viewers a modern-day 
“Twilight Zone.” Created by 
English satirist Charlie Brooker 
(“Dead Set”), “Black Mirror” 
depicts different realities and 
characters in each episode, but 
every story connects to one 
another through their thought-
provoking, somewhat cynical 
perspectives on technology.

The first two seasons tackled 

a variety of tech-based issues, 
critiquing everything from the 
pervasiveness 
of 
advertising 

and the porn industry (“Fifteen 
Million Merits”) to the double-
edged sword of artificial intel-
ligence (“Be Right Back”). With 
a third season comprising of six 
episodes instead of the usual 
three, “Black Mirror” returns 
to the drawing board with more 
ambitious ideas, even if not all of 
them hit the target.

Though the first four episodes 

struggle under the weight of 
the binge-laden Netflix format, 
“Black Mirror” ’s third season 
remains a landmark in televi-

sion storytelling. It continues 
to explore the dark depths of 
technology, but also manages to 
offer an optimistic message in 
some episodes. In fact, the epi-

sodes with those 
optimistic 
mes-

sages (the fascinat-
ing season opener 
“Nosedive” 
and 

the unpredictably 
poignant love story 
“San 
Junipero”) 

work 
far 
better 

than the grimmer, 
more heavy-hand-
ed ones (the terri-

fying horror clip “Playtest” and 
the meandering cyber-thriller 
“Shut Up and Dance”).

Co-written by “Parks & Rec-

reation” ’s Michael Schur and 
Rashida Jones (“Angie Tribe-
ca”), “Nosedive” triumphs as 
a satire of instant gratification 
and the constant yearning for 
validation a la Instagram, even 
if the episode feels somewhat 
familiar and predictable. The 
story is set in a reality akin to 
the one in Spike Jonze’s “Her,” 
matching the film’s utopian/
dystopian setting and aesthetic 
styles with gorgeous pastel color 
tones and a beautiful piano-lad-
en score.

The only real difference is 

that in the world of “Nose-
dive,” people rate one another 
on a five-star system and earn 
a greater status in society with 
the more stars they receive. 
Perky 
social 
climber 
Lacie 

Pound (Bryce Dallas Howard, 
“Jurassic World”) is determined 
to reach a 4.8 in order to get a 
discount on her dream house, 
no matter if she has to pretend 
to be nice to everyone she meets 
or give them all five-star ratings. 
Soon, however, Lacie finds that 
perhaps it might be better to be 
her more authentic self, even 
if she’s ridiculed and alienated 
for it. We see her undergo this 
gradual realization during an 
incredible final act that’s hilari-
ous, devastating and mesmeriz-
ing all in one.

“San Junipero” also man-

ages to be a highlight in season 
three of “Black Mirror,” mixing 
sci-fi, drama and romance with 
remarkable performances from 

Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw 
(“Easy”) 

and Mackenzie Davis (“Halt 
and Catch Fire”). Without giv-
ing too much away, the story 
of “San Junipero” is quite riv-
eting, tracking the relation-
ship between the timid Yorkie 
(Davis) and the outgoing Kelly 
(Mbatha-Raw) and how their 
love literally transcends time, 
space and technology. 

On the downside, the main 

problem with the third season of 
“Black Mirror” is that its darker 
episodes don’t have the same 
balance of unpredictability and 
intrigue as previous seasons. 
Even with an increase in run-
ning time, episodes like “Play-
test” and “Shut Up and Dance” 
could probably work better if a 
sequence or two were cut, per-
haps in order to focus on the 
payoff of both stories.

With the trippy “Playtest,” 

technology plays a villainous 
role, as free-spirited Cooper 
(Wyatt 
Russell, 
“Everybody 

Wants Some!!”) takes part in an 
experimental, 
virtual-reality-

type video game in order to make 
some quick cash. However, Coo-
per runs into some trouble when 
he encounters some of his worst 
repressed nightmares come to 
life. The build-up is certainly 
effective, as is Russell’s surpris-
ingly strong performance, but 
the conclusion of “Playtest” falls 
somewhat short, opting to make 
one extremely dark joke instead 
of trying to make a point.

Similarly, the extremely tense 

“Shut Up and Dance” loses its 
momentum right when it could 
easily turn into something inter-
esting. 
Introverted 
teenager 

Kenny (Alex Lawther, “The Imi-
tation Game”) is forced to carry 
orders from an anonymous tex-
ter in order to avoid getting a 
nude video leaked online. The 
episode keeps you on your toes, 
but ends on a disappointing and 
frustrating note. 

Despite some of its drawbacks 

this season, “Black Mirror” is 
still worth watching, either for 
entertainment or insight. And 
whether or not “Black Mirror” is 
anti- or pro-technology, its third 
season confirms that it remains 
one of television’s greatest hid-
den gems.

EVENT PREVIEW

Art meets science through an 

inquisitive look at the theory of 
multiverse in “Constellations” 
by Nick Payne — a 
captivating 
and 

passionate 
love 

story that explores 
questions of fate 
and choice.

This Thursday, 

School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance 
Senior 
Clarisza 

Runtung will pres-
ent Payne’s piece as 
her senior thesis.

In January 2012, 

“Constellations” 
earned immense praise when 
it premiered at the Royal Court 
Theatre. It later appeared on 
Broadway at the Samuel J. Fried-
man Theatre in January 2015. In 
London, the cast was led by Rafe 
Spall and Sally Hawkins and later, 
in New York, by Jake Gyllenhaal 
and Ruth Wilson.

“ ‘Constellations’ is about a boy 

meets girl and then a boy meets 
girl again and again,” Runtung 
said. “With all the decisions they 
make when they meet each other, 
which one progresses to the next 
level?”

The set and lights for the show 

are minimalistic, as these sim-
plistic elements leave room for a 
thorough look into the inner com-
plexities of science. Exchanges 
between both characters leave a 
myriad of possibilities to unfold, 
with their relationship growing 
stronger as space and time prog-
ress.

“You’ll be peeking at a very 

personal world of these two char-
acters — how their relationship 

develops, how it breaks, how they 
first met each other, how they first 
break up, how they first hurt each 
other,” Runtung said. 

The 
play 
revolves 
around 

the 
relationship 

between Marianne 
and Roland. Mari-
anne, a physicist, 
explores how the 
theories of physics 
apply to her own 
life. Roland, a bee-
keeper, shares his 
passions alongside 
Marianne, as their 
unique 
interests 

complement their 
evolving relation-
ship and each new 

possibility 
examined 
through 

different multiverses leads them 
both on an entirely different path.

“It’s kind of like a laboratory. 

One person does this and one per-
son does that and you kind of get 
to play around with those things,” 
Runtung said.

Marianne and Roland both 

have 
different 
passions, 
yet 

in their differences, they are 
brought closer together. Rutung 
describes the script as written 
with language that is simple, but 
effective in communicating the 
dimensions of this relationship.

“I want the audience to leave 

the room thinking about what 
‘meant to be’ really is,” Runtung 
said. “There are so many pos-
sibilities and I would like them 
to see that they have to be in the 
moment, because every possibil-
ity can happen.”

The cast considers how time 

and space intersect, as well as the 
power of free will. Do we have 
it? Where is its place in our lives? 
“Constellations” offers guidance 

to answering these questions.

Runtung’s project is particu-

larly exciting for her because of 
the play’s focus on science and art 
illuminates her own interests and 
studies.

“I have always been really 

interested in connecting art and 
science,” Runtung said. “I do 
theatre because I really want 
to explore what a human being 
really is and I feel like there’s no 
better way to explore that than 
putting it onstage.”

While planning what her thesis 

would look like, Runtung’s advi-
sor suggested she choose some-
thing that she liked and to just 
go crazy with it. This play offers 
the challenge of representing 
complexities of theory, while also 
connecting these ideas with the 
beauty and familiarity of a love 
story.

“I don’t want to say it’s realis-

tic, because sometimes when you 
say that, it just seems like you’re 
watching two people talking to 
each other,” Runtung said. “It’s 
not that.”

“Constellations” is composed 

of a team of four: Runtung direct-
ing, SMTD Senior Anastasia 
Zavitsanos 
playing 
Marianne, 

SMTD Junior Peter Donahue 
playing Roland and SMTD Fresh-
men stage managing. The intima-
cy of the group, Runtung said, has 
allowed for deep thinking about 
what ideas this play is exploring 
and what the actors are ultimate-
ly trying to communicate through 
their story.

“This play has been a beauti-

ful journey for every single one 
of us in the room and all of us are 
exploring the beauty of the space.” 
Runtung said. “It’s the first time I 
have had an experience like this.”

FILM REVIEW

The documentary “Songs from 

the North” is a fascinating experi-
mental film contrasting scenes 
from North Korean 
movies, 
theater, 

state media and 
everyday 
life 
to 

paint a more vivid 
picture 
of 
the 

notorious 
hermit 

nation. The film 
doesn’t have a nar-
rative of any kind; 
it’s essentially a 
distilled hour-long 
collection of footage the South 
Korean director Soon-Mi Yoo shot 
on three different trips she took 
took to North Korea. And yet the 
way she weaves in selections from 
movies and live performances illu-
minates the psyche of a country so 
blocked off from the world.

The documentary has several 

moments that are incredibly raw 
and must be seen to be believed. 
In one scene, Yoo records a Kore-
an War veteran speaking to chil-
dren at the Shinchon Museum of 
American Atrocities, describing 
incredibly inhumane conditions he 
endured as a prisoner of war under 
American control. He concludes 
by unapologetically defending his 
absolute hatred towards Ameri-
cans to children. No amount of sat-
ire like “The Interview” would be 
able get at the root of North Kore-
an aggression towards the United 
States like this. The North Koreans 
interviewed in the documentary 
are unflinching when describ-
ing their complete loyalty to their 
country. Having only heard the 
stories of grateful defectors, seeing 
the faces of those who maintain 
North Korea’s tense position in 
world affairs is shocking.

And yet the humanity of indi-

vidual North Koreans is vividly 
captured here as well. Such small 
moments as schoolchildren smil-
ing and waving to the camera as 
they walk past, or a restaurant 
owner getting flustered after Yoo 

tells her she’s pretty, makes North 
Korea feel like any other place in 
the world, despite how closed-off it 
is. The fact that Yoo is South Kore-
an noticeably helps the dialogue 

feel 
like 
natural 

conversation, 
and 

less like an intrusive 
window into their 
mysterious culture.

The public opin-

ion expressed by 
North Koreans is 
supplemented 
by 

scenes of daily life 
in film, live perfor-
mances and state 

propaganda that explicitly play out 
the hostile attitudes the DPRK’s 
government holds to this day. How-
ever, it quickly becomes apparent 
that every aspect of North Korean 
life ties back to propaganda. It’s 
incredibly nauseating – there’s not 
a single orderly school building or 
pristine yet barren temple without 
pictures of former supreme leaders 
Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il front 
and center. The way North Korean 
art is juxtaposed with interviews 
with North Koreans brilliantly 
illustrates the cause-and-effect 
relationship between the deeply 
nationalistic messages conveyed in 
the media and the loyalty the citi-
zens express to the perceived well-
being of their country.

The most vivid patriot in the 

documentary is a middle school 
boy who passionately sobs as he 
speaks to an assembly after being 
selected as a representative for his 
school at a government function 
in Pyongyang. As if it wasn’t eerie 
enough watching North Koreans 
tear up just looking at imagery of 
Kim Il-sung, the little boy goes 
on to declare Kim Jong-il his real 
“father and mother” who loves 
and protects him when his parents 
do not after he was informed the 
President bestowed love onto him 
“endlessly.”

To be sure, this was the most 

hysterical display of devotion to 
the ruling family in the film. But 
the spooky domination the DPRK 

has over the collective North Kore-
an psyche is made tangible after 
watching the country’s art extol 
the same values the boy expresses.

“Songs from the North” is not 

only chock-full of information 
on North Korean art, but its cin-
ematography is lovely as well. The 
traditional architecture of North 
Korea is consistently framed by 
the lush, green nature abundant 
around Pyongyang, making the 
country look like somewhere you 
could actually call home in spite 
of the known harsh standards of 
living.

The subjects are always placed 

in such a way that brings the view-
er’s eyes across their surround-
ings, setting them off-center or 
enveloped within their location 
to artfully capture the context of 
their scenes. There are no “talking 
heads” here, just a taste of North 
Korean public opinion straight 
from the source. And the crisp, 
vivid coloring breathes life into 
the people and their daily jobs. 
This keeps the indifferent nature 
of some people interviewed, saying 
things like “Why film me clean-
ing?” or “You are filming too long!” 
from feeling unconducive to the 
film’s topic. With Kim Jong-un 
dominating headlines regularly, it 
is jarringly humanizing to see the 
faces and hear some of the voices 
of countless regular people who 
make up the country. The fact that 
such normal people can have their 
worldview so radically controlled 
by their government is thought-
provoking in the highest.

The documentary does a fantas-

tic job getting as close as possible 
to North Korea to see the country 
on its own terms. In spite of its 
experimental form, the film logi-
cally charges through almost the 
entirety of North Korean history 
with raw emotion from all direc-
tions – by actual citizens and art-
ists’ interpretations of them. Yoo’s 
contribution to the limited amount 
of footage capturing North Korea 
from an outsider’s perspective is 
one to be treasured.

T

he Manic Pixie Dream 
Girl has been part of 
pop culture for as long 

as men have looked to women 
to occupy a two-dimensional 
role in their lives. The feminine 
trope acquired that quirky 
name when Nathan Rabin, a 
film critic for The A.V. Club, 
used that phrase to describe 
Kirsten Dunst’s character in 
“Elizabethtown” (2005). He 
called her “that bubbly, shallow 
cinematic creature that exists 
solely in the fevered imagina-
tions of sensitive writer-direc-
tors to teach broodingly soulful 
young men to embrace life 
and its infinite mysteries and 
adventures.”

Having never actually seen 

“Elizabethtown,” I cannot 
attest to the truth of this state-
ment. However, I do know a 
MPDG when I see one: they’re 
everywhere. In fact, they seem 
to be multiplying, waltzing 
with their ukuleles from film to 
TV show to music video, from 
Hollywood to Sundance to 
Cannes to SAC 310.

It’s great that people are 

more aware of how female 
characters are often written as 
solely two-dimensional vehi-
cles for male enlightenment. 
But recently, as more and more 
female characters are slapped 
with the disparaging label of 
MPDG, there has been some 
backlash — and deservedly so. 
People, including Nathan Rabin 
himself, who has said that he 
regrets coining the phrase, 
are starting to think it’s unfair 
that every female character 
who possesses some weird trait 
or unusual hobby or obscure 
taste in music is labeled as 
MPDG. If girls are MPDGs 
when they’re different, but 
basic when they’re “normal,” 
how do you write a non-MPDG 
female character who doesn’t 
too closely resemble a piece of 
Wonder Bread?

While there’s no shortage of 

Manic Pixie Dream Girls pop-
ping up, the quickness of the 
gavel to label a female charac-
ter a MPDG — thus shrinking 
opportunities to believe in 
creative, complex female char-
acters — isn’t the real crux of 
the issue.

The problem is that the term 

Manic Pixie Dream Girl is 
starting to become an insult in 
itself wielded against women, 
not the men who use them. The 
whole point of the label is to 
hold writers accountable for 
using women as plot drivers, 
bringers of male epiphanies or 
adventuresses who brighten 
the lives of the men they laugh-
ingly lead by the hand into the 
horizon (or don’t: see “500 
Days of Summer” for an exam-
ple). Instead, it has become 
a quick, culturally relevant, 
in-the-know way to criticize 
women. This is especially 
relevant to how it relates to 
aesthetics. The point of Manic 
Pixie Dream Girl is not to 
criticize a woman’s wardrobe 
or hair or makeup choices; it 
never has been, but that is what 
it has devolved into.

By focusing too much on aes-

thetics and allowing the term 
to be used to criticize female 
characters in a vacuum without 
analyzing how they’re used 
by the men in the story, we’re 
forgetting the point. What used 
to be a term used to criticize 
writers and directors for using 
women solely as props has now 
become a term to demean or 
dismiss the women themselves.

I have even heard people 

call real women — women they 
know, are friends with, are dat-
ing — Manic Pixie Dream Girls. 
The most obvious example of 
this would be Zooey Deschanel, 
who has become the poster girl 
for MPDGs. The actor herself 
has been referred to by this 
label, starting from when she 
was the undeniable MPDG 
in “500 Days of Summer” to 
the recurring Saturday Night 
Live sketch “Bein’ Quirky with 
Zooey Deschanel” to even her 
character in “New Girl.” While 
her character in the 2009 
movie was absolutely a MPDG 
— her only role to lead Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt to emotional 
awakenings — her character 
in “New Girl” is not. And the 
SNL sketch doesn’t make fun of 
the idea of MPDGs, but rather 
takes Deschanel’s character 
traits and holds them up to 
mockery.

Real women can’t be Manic 

Pixie Dream Girls, because that 
term refers to a construct built 
by men. Calling a real woman 

a MPDG for any reason — her 
wardrobe, her taste in music, 
her favorite books, whatever 
— is essentially turning her 
into two-dimensional arche-
type. Please, for the love of 
the nine muses — all of whom 
were women, who would’ve 
thought? — don’t refer to a real 
woman as a Manic Pixie Dream 
anything.

Ross Putnam, a producer 

with a Twitter account that 
went viral — @femscriptin-
tros — helped shine a spotlight 
on the origins of this problem 
when he started tweeting 
“intros for female leads in 
actual scripts” that he has read, 
changing all of the names to 
Jane.

Some of my personal favor-

ites include: “JANE stares into 
camera through intense eyes 
— she’s beautiful but hard, like 
a layer of humanity has been 
scraped away,” “Jane (late 20s) 
sits hunched over a microscope. 
She’s attractive, but too much 
of a professional to care about 
her appearance,” “All heads 
turn to fine JANE (28) in the 
doorway: stunning and trying 
her best to hide it” and finally, 
“A gorgeous woman, JANE, 23, 
is a little tipsy, dancing naked 
on her big bed, as adorable as 
she is sexy. *BONUS PTS FOR 
BEING THE 1ST LINE.”

The worst part is that not all 

of these characters would be 
described as MPDGs, because 
some of them may just be side-
kicks or non-romantic leads or 
just happy neurotypicals. Not 
every single one of these char-
acter intros have to do with 
the woman’s attractiveness or 
her relationship to her physical 
appearance, but the vast major-
ity do. And these are real films. 
If even the intros to a character 
hold nothing of substance, how 
is the character supposed to?

The MPDG trope isn’t the 

only archetype or misogynis-
tic weak writing tool that still 
plagues our media, but the 
creation and consumption of 
trope itself coupled with the 
flawed criticism of it is one of 
the most insidious problems in 
the industry.

As climate change is a hugely 

complicated 
and 
multifaceted 

issue, it’s difficult to create a com-
prehensive 
look 

into all of its causes 
and implications. 
However, “Before 
the Flood” does 
an impressive job 
of showcasing the 
multiple perspec-
tives surrounding 
climate change, as 
well as its real-time impacts and 
possible solutions. Oscar Award 
winner, United Nations Ambassa-
dor for Peace and slick man about 
town Leonardo DiCaprio (“The 
Revenant”) partners with Nation-
al Geographic to create a terrify-
ing and provocative exposition of 
climate change.

The documentary begins with 

a look at the industrial side of cli-
mate change, revealing the world’s 
dependence on fossil fuel indus-
tries for global energy systems. 
Unsurprisingly, the U.S. is revealed 
as one of the major consumers of 
energy and subsequent emitters 
of fossil fuels, providing a much-
needed slap in the face to the issue 
and consequences of American 
consumerism. The film constantly 
reinforces the massive scale and 
harmful effects of the fossil fuel 
industries. However, it sometimes 
falls short in explaining exactly 
how they operate, instead assum-
ing the viewer understands these 
processes.

One of the major achievements 

of the film is that it goes beyond 
attempting to convince the view-
er that climate change exists; 

instead, it presents the indisput-
able science and moves on from 
any discussion of its validity. The 
film does address the many biases 
in politics and the media, with 
clips of Republican politicians and 

newscasters deny-
ing the existence of 
climate change. The 
documentary 
suc-

ceeds in revealing 
a terrifying reality 
of the number and 
power of climate 
change 
deniers, 

showing gridlock in 

a Congress stuffed with ignorant 
policymakers blocking legislation. 
The public, in turn, is force-fed the 
illusion that climate change is a 
debatable issue.

The brilliance of “Before the 

Flood” lies in the way it shows 
how all these perspectives are 
intertwined. The film uncovers 
the practice of fossil fuel corpora-
tions paying people with scientific 
or political credentials to deny cli-
mate change and lobby Congress 
to block any climate change legis-
lation. In short, politics is rife with 
institutional corruption in favor of 
corporate interest. This influences 
the media and the public perspec-
tive, adding to public ignorance of 
the very real and immediate prob-
lem of climate change.

The documentary also does a 

nice job widening the lens from 
American politics to the global 
environmental and social effects 
of climate change. With gorgeous 
footage from all over the globe, 
Leonardo DiCaprio explores the 
melting of the polar ice caps, the 
flooding of agricultural lands in 
India and the devastation of the 
pacific islands. Testimony from 

real people in real places works 
to put this issue into a digestible 
context, reinforcing the fact that 
climate change is affecting land-
scapes and people in real time. 
Furthermore, the film brilliantly 
captures one bitter paradox, that 
those who contribute to climate 
change the least are the ones most 
effected. This crushing reality is 
necessary to understand but leaves 
the upper middle class American 
viewer feeling powerless.

The film rounds out with an 

exploration of solutions. Almost 
gratuitously, 
President 
Barack 

Obama slides in with his charac-
teristically presidential optimism, 
reinforcing the hope that educat-
ing the masses will elicit change. 
Economists and other officials 
discuss a carbon tax to incentivize 
clean energy use, while reinforc-
ing following the example of world 
leaders in renewable energy. Even 
the Pope endorses climate change 
and calls for global systematic 
restructuring.

Despite these possible solu-

tions, Leo remains heavily cynical; 
the film ends with the bone-chill-
ing driving point that the U.S. 
and the world has the capacity to 
reverse climate change, but lacks 
the political will. The documen-
tary’s main failing lies in its final 
confusing placing of responsibil-
ity – is it the people’s job to change 
policy through careful consumer-
ism or careful voting? Does it go 
higher, with the need for nations 
to implement clean energy sys-
tems? Is it both, or something else? 
The effect of this confusion is an 
overall documentary that is cap-
tivating, thought-provoking and 
inspiring – but ultimately over-
whelming.

Lewis feeling fresh heading into East Lansing

Usually, this is the time of 

year when bodies are aching.

The college football season 

is more than halfway over, and 
as the games get tougher, it 
only makes sense that players 
start to feel the effects. But for 
Jourdan Lewis, this year has 
been different.

“I was getting thrown at a lot 

(last year), but it just seems like 
they go at me every once in a 
while now,” Lewis said Saturday. 
“Probably just once a game.”

The 
result 
is 
a 
fresher 

feeling at this time of year for 
Michigan’s All-American senior 
cornerback.

Lewis missed the season’s 

first three games with an injury, 
but the other reason he feels so 
fresh right now is more about 
what’s happened when he’s on 
the field. After he said he was 
targeted only one time against 
the Fighting Illini, Lewis said 
his body feels much better after 
games now, and with decreased 
snap-by-snap dependence, it’s 
easy to understand why.

“The trainers came in and 

joked with me a little bit (after 
the Rutgers game),” Lewis said 
Monday. “They told me, ‘I don’t 
even know why you’re here, 
man. You played a quarter and 
a half.’ ”

Really, this benefit extends 

to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
whole 

secondary. Right now, Michigan 
has had the fifth-fewest passes 
attempted against it nationally 
with 164. The first-ranked team, 
Florida, has 140, but has also 
played one fewer game.

That means that either no one 

wants to throw at Michigan, or 
no one has been able to — and 
the answer is likely both.

When opponents have thrown 

on the Wolverines, it hasn’t 

exactly been a fruitful endeavor. 
Michigan is allowing just a 
40.9 
completion 
percentage 

this season, second-lowest in 
the country behind Florida. 
The Wolverines have picked off 
seven passes, which is one more 
than the number of touchdown 
passes they have allowed.

Somehow, those numbers are 

even uglier against Michigan’s 
cornerbacks. According to Pro 
Football Focus College, opposing 
passers 
are 
11-for-39 
when 

targeting 
receivers 
covered 

by Lewis or senior cornerback 
Channing Stribling. The two 
have allowed a total of 131 yards 
with zero touchdowns and have 
racked up four interceptions.

And all of that is when 

those quarterbacks can get 
their throws off. For as little 
as opponents decide to pass 
against Michigan, there’s also 
the matter of what happens 
when they do.

The 

Wolverines 
have 25 sacks 
through 
seven 

games, 
and 

that’s 
to 
say 

nothing 
of 

plays 
where 

quarterbacks 
are 
forced 
to 

throw the ball 
away or run out 
of bounds. So while it’s easy 
to point to Lewis’ dominance 
in coverage as the reason his 

targets 
have 
lowered, 
the 

cornerback 
offered 
another 

explanation.

“I’m telling you,” Lewis said 

Monday, “The defensive line 

is so good, I 
can’t even tell 
you if that’s me, 
really.”

Of 
course, 

it doesn’t hurt 
to 
have 
two 

corners as good 
as 
Lewis 
and 

Stribling.

Lewis’ 

success 
has 

been 
well-

documented, but Stribling is 
having a breakout season of his 
own. He has three interceptions, 

including 
one 
touchdown, 

numbers that may soon make 
quarterbacks think twice about 
throwing his way, too.

And if they decide to go to 

the other side again, Lewis is 
ready for that, too. As it turns 
out, covering receivers who 
don’t get thrown to leaves 
Lewis wondering when his few 
chances will come.

“It’s not so much bored, it’s 

just like anxious, you want to 
know when your next play is 
coming,” he explained. “Every 
time you’re in there, it’s not so 
much, ‘Oh my god, when are 
they going to throw at me?’ I’m 
just like, ‘Oh my god, this could 
be it, this could be it.’ ”

But most of the time, it isn’t.

Nation’s best defense still trying to improve

When Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh was asked Monday 
how his defense could improve, 
he was stumped. Harbaugh 
leads his team with the mantra 
of improving every single day, 
but it’s hard to imagine how the 
defense could get much better.

“I 
mean, 
that’s 
a 
great 

question,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 

“They’re playing so good. We just 
really have to give them a pat on 
the back right now, but it’s not 
time to take a victory lap. Just to 
keep going at the same relentless, 
intense pace that they’ve had 
and approach that they’ve had to 
every game, because we’re a little 
over the halfway point. You don’t 
want to take a victory lap, but you 
do have to recognize that this 
defense is playing great football.”

The second-ranked Wolverines 

have allowed the fewest total 
yards in the nation while ranking 
first in passing defense and fourth 
in rushing defense.

The latter irritates fifth-

year senior defensive end Chris 
Wormley.

“When 
you 
look 
at 
the 

different 
categories, 
we’re 

(ranked No. 1) in a lot of them, 
but we want to be (No. 1) in all of 
them. I think we’re third in like 
rushing defense, which kind of 
pisses us off, but at the end of 
the day, if we get wins, we’re 
pretty happy.”

This week, Michigan will 

travel to East Lansing to take 
on a Spartan squad that has lost 
its past five games. Michigan 
prides itself on preparing for 
each game the same way, and 
this week will be no different for 
the defense.

The 
unit 
generally 
looks 

at the opponents’ big plays 
that can cause a swing in a 
game when looking for areas 
of 
improvement, 
and 
after 

Michigan 
State 
beat 
the 

Wolverines on an infamous 
game-ending play last season, 
Michigan is unlikely to overlook 
the details. 

After last week’s game, when 

the Wolverines routed Illinois 
41-8, the Fighting Illini’s fourth-
quarter 
43-yard 
touchdown 

pass has been a point of focus.

“I guess when you look at the 

film and you see what you can 
do better, you look at the big 

plays first,” Wormley said. “You 
look at when they scored, and 
you 
see 
what 

we can do as a 
defense 
better 

than what we 
did on that play.

“But 
at 
the 

end of the day, 
like 
you 
said, 

it’s hard to find 
things 
when 

we’re doing so 
well, 
but 
like 

I said, there’s 
always things to get better on.”

The 
Wolverines 
have 

allowed just 70 points this 
season, the fewest of any team 

in the nation. 
Part of that can 
be 
attributed 

to the defense’s 
overall age. Of 
the 11 starters 
on defense, nine 
are seniors.

Fellow senior 

Jake Butt isn’t 
surprised 
by 

just how prolific 
the defense has 

been because he has seen its 
work ethic and development 

throughout the last four years. 
The tight end has known for 
months how good they would 
be.

“I’m not dazzled, because I 

knew how talented they were,” 
Butt said. “I’m confident saying 
they work as hard, if not harder, 
than anyone in the country. 
That started with this summer 
and 
through 
this 
summer 

preparation. Those D-line guys 
have had that mentality for as 
long as I’ve been here. I’d say 
that they’re the hardest working 
group on the team and it shows 
in how they play.”

Harbaugh on how top-ranked unit can be better: ‘That’s a great question. They’re playing so good’

‘Team Michigan’ in the hunt for $500,000

Engineering doctoral students 

Kyle 
Hanquist 
and 
Kevin 

Neitzel’s journeys to national 
TV began in an alleyway in 
Copenhagen, Denmark.

At a conference in Europe 

last 
year, 
the 
aerospace 

engineers 
received 
an 
email 

from the University’s College of 
Engineering about a new Golf 
Channel reality show “Driver vs. 
Driver.” The challenge: in “Shark 
Tank” style, aspiring golf club 
designers invent an innovative 
driver to pitch to equipment 
manufacturer Wilson Golf.

Hanquist and Neitzel received 

the information only one week 
before video submissions were 
due and questioned whether 
there would be enough time to 
produce an idea and application.

But the opportunity to combine 

their aerospace knowledge with a 
love for golf couldn’t go to waste 
— not to mention the prospect of 
teaming with one of golf’s most 
legendary brands.

Wilson Golf’s range of products 

includes drivers, fairway woods, 
hybrids, wedges, putters and balls 
for amateur and professional 
players. Since 1922, PGA Tour 
stars Arnold Palmer, John Daly, 
Vijay Singh and others have won 
a combined 61 major tournaments 
using Wilson products.

“Being outside of the golf club 

design industry, we thought our 
idea could bring something new 
to (golfers),” Neitzel said. “And 
there’s 
a 
half-a-million-dollar 

prize, so that was pretty good, too.”

After 
brainstorming 
to 

reach their best concept, they 
conducted the video shoot in the 
Copenhagen alleyway.

“That was pretty random,” 

Hanquist said. “But I think it 
helped us stand out when they 
saw us.”

Besting over 300 applicants, 

Hanquist and Neitzel — now 
coined 
“Team 
Michigan” 
— 

were among 11 teams selected 
to compete head-to-head on the 

show. Engineers, teachers and 
golf professionals are among the 
many hopefuls.

The seven-episode elimination 

series 
culminates 
with 
the 

announcement of the winner on 
the Nov. 22 finale. The $500,000 
grand prize comes with a chance 
for the winning driver design to 
be included in next year’s Wilson 
product line.

The first episode aired on 

Oct. 4 and the second this past 
Tuesday. Teams pitched their 
designs to judges Tim Clarke, 
President of Wilson Golf; Frank 
Thomas, former United States 
Golf 
Association 
Technical 

Director; and Brian Urlacher, 
former Chicago Bears linebacker 
and avid golfer.

Through 
two 
episodes, 

Team Michigan survived the 
elimination of five teams and 
were surprised the cut was so 
steep so early in the filming. The 
third episode airs Tuesday, and 
Hanquist and Neitzel say they 
will be heavily featured.

“To have a one-in-six chance 

on half-a-million dollars, I’d take 
those odds,” Hanquist said.

Even if defeated, Hanquist and 

Neitzel plan to pursue turning 
their driver design into a business.

Team Michigan is confident 

its expertise in aerodynamics 
will not only help golfers hit balls 
with greater velocity and further, 
but straighter off the tee. They 
turned to Formula One cars and 
airplane designs’ aerodynamics 
for inspiration to incorporate into 
their club technology.

“(Wilson 
Golf) 
wants 

something that’s new, that’s going 
to break the mold a little bit, so we 
really tried to be different than 
what’s out there already,” Neitzel 
said. “We really focused on things 
that we would want in a driver, 
and pushed things a little bit with 
the physics background we have.”

Taping started last October 

at 
Wilson’s 
Chicago-area 

headquarters and presents the 
full process of bringing driver 
ideas to life. Although Hanquist 

and Neitzel know the contest’s 
outcome, they are prohibited from 
disclosure. However, they alluded 
the next five episodes shift focus 
from design pitches to the evolution 
and production of tangible clubs, 
with more contestants getting cut 
along the way.

Though having their club being 

used on the PGA Tour would be a 
remarkable feat, Team Michigan 
hopes one person above anyone 
else will “grip it and rip it.”

“We see (Michigan football) 

head coach Jim Harbaugh golfing 
in a lot of Pro-Ams,” Hanquist 
said. “That would probably be 
the coolest thing ever if we saw 
him using our golf club at Pebble 
Beach. I mean, that would be the 
most surreal thing ever.”

Over a year ago, Hanquist and 

Neitzel shot their application video 
in a Copenhagen alleyway, with 
no idea if they would get a spot on 
the show. Now, the opportunity to 
represent their university on such 
a large scale is one neither man 
could ever have imagined.

MEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ stands united with 
Ohio State in rivalry

There is arguably no bigger 

rivalry in college athletics than 
Ohio State-Michigan, but some 
things are bigger than sports. 
That was evident Friday night, 
when the Michigan men’s soccer 
team put the competition aside 
to honor Fikayo Idowu, the Ohio 
State defender who passed away 
in a drowning accident in June.

For a brief moment, there 

were no Wolverines or Buckeyes, 
just players and fans observing 
a moment of silence for one of 
their own. Idowu was a young 
man who had the same passion 
and played the game with the 
same intensity as the Michigan 
players. This sense of community 
is rare in any matchup between 
Ohio State and Michigan.

“Sports 
give 
us 
an 

extraordinary opportunity to 
come together,” said Michigan 
senior captain defender Lars 
Eckenrode. “Coming into this 
game I felt we had an opportunity 
to honor their player, who passed 
away, and it did bring us closer.”

Eckenrode wrote a letter to 

the Ohio State program on behalf 
of the Wolverines, sending their 
condolences in a time of grieving. 
The team wanted to further 
honor Idowu on Friday evening.

“Our captains approached us 

to want to do something prior to 
the game,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “To do something 
for the game I thought was great, 
to continue to honor his memory 
regardless of the rivalry.”

Despite the pregame show of 

respect, the rivalry proved fierce 
as ever on the field. Throughout 
the game, the teams committed 
hard fouls and kept tensions high.

This was evident near the end 

of the first half, when Michigan 
junior defender Billy Stevens had 
to be held back by teammates 

during an argument with several 
Ohio State players, following a 
hard foul against the Buckeyes. 
In overtime, Stevens was again 
restrained 
by 
teammates, 

following an altercation that led 
to yellow cards for players on both 
sides. The game ended with 34 
total fouls. Michigan’s previous 
outing featured just 20 total fouls.

Historically, 
the 
Buckeyes 

have had the edge in the rivalry, 
holding a 20-10-1 record going 
into 
Friday 
night’s 
game. 

Michigan needed a win to avenge 
last year’s performances. In 2015, 
the Wolverines went 0-2 against 
Ohio State, losing in both the 
regular season and in the Big Ten 
Championship.

The game was filled with 

intense play, and neither side 
could 
gain 
any 
momentum. 

However, with 23 seconds left in 
the second overtime, Ohio State 
scored, ending the game 1-0.

Off the field, the bond between 

each team runs deep. Ohio State 
assistant coach Ian Gordona 
spent two seasons at Michigan. 
Forwards Jacob Duska and Nate 
Kohl transferred to the Buckeyes 
after each spent their freshman 
years in Ann Arbor.

“It’s always fun,” Eckenrode 

said. “And it was cool to see 
(former teammates) on the field 
again.”

This is another example of 

a bright spot on an otherwise 
bitter coexistence.

While the majority of the time 

there is nothing but animosity 
between the sides, honoring 
Idowu showed that there are 
things that transcend the rivalry 
and puts the game on hold.

“Football is one thing, but life 

is another,” Daley said.

It’s moments like the one 

before Friday’s game that Daley’s 
point is never more evident, and 
reminds fans that at the end of 
the day, everybody is human.

Just nine minutes into the 

second race of the day, the 
Michigan women’s rowing team’s 
first boat, after starting in eighth 
place, overtook Penn’s boat to 
slide into third. At the same 
moment, the New York Athletic 
Club came up from behind and 
pushed the Wolverines into 
fourth. But Michigan kept steady 
on the meter of first-eight junior 
coxswain Nadia 
Roohparvar 
for 
the 
next 

seven minutes. 
Michigan went 
on to give up 
only one spot 
to 
first 
bow-

number Brown 
in 
the 
final 

stretch for a top-
five finish. 

This 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines sent two eights 
to the 52nd annual Head of 
the Charles regatta in Boston. 
Competing Sunday against 33 
other boats, both Michigan’s 
first and second eights placed 
in the top 10 of the women’s 
championship race.

“Practices have been intense,” 

Roohparvar said. “There’s been 
a lot of switching between boats; 
I think people have been really 
stepping up to the challenge … 
Lots of the results (Sunday) were 
exceeding expectation for this 
point in the season.” 

The 
race 
began 
with 

Michigan’s first eight in eighth 
place, and its second eight in 15th 
overall. After passing the first 
marker at 4:12.083, the second 
boat was in 18th place. Within 
five minutes, at the Weld marker, 
the crew pushed itself to 10th.

The talk of the race from 

Michigan’s end was volunteer 
assistant coach, Felice Mueller, 

who rowed for the New York 
Athletic Club. Her boat overtook 
the Wolverines at the second 
marker, 
just 
as 
Michigan 

overtook Penn at time 9:29.775.

While the second eight looked 

to make their way up to ninth, 
the first eight looked to maintain 
their top-five place. Past the CBC 
marker at just over 14 minutes, 
Brown inched just past the 
Wolverines. Unable to take back 
fourth in the final two minutes, 
Michigan maintained its lead 

over 
Virginia 

by under seven 
seconds 
for 

a 
fifth-place 

finish time of 
16:53.339.

Though 

it 
was 
a 

picturesque 
day 
on 
the 

Charles River, 

high-speed winds made the 
course challenging. As much 
as the race was about strong 
rowing, the conditions made 
it also a tough test of steering 
and planning. According to 
Roohparvar, the start of the 
race was particularly windy.

“There’s a lot of chaos, and you 

kind of have to keep your cool,” 
she said. “The start was really, 
really windy, but we were able to 
make up a lot of ground because 
we dealt with it better than a lot 
of crews did.”

Coach 
Mark 
Rothstein 

highlighted 
Roohparvar 
and 

second-eight coxswain freshman 
Kathryn Boyle, as well as stroke 
seats Kaitlin Wright and second-
eight senior Tessa Yurko.

“There’s a lot of steering, and 

it’s important for the coxswains 
to manage that well,” Rothstein 
said. “I thought both our stroke 
seats set really good rhymes. 
I feel good about the results, a 
much stronger result than we 
had last year.”

Flaherty a preseason 
All-Big Ten selection

Junior point guard Katelynn 

Flaherty is probably the most 
familiar face on the Michigan 
women’s basketball team — 
and with good reason. She 
already holds program records 
in points, with 774, and field 
goals, with 280.

Those numbers have now 

gotten the attention of the 
rest of the Big Ten. Flaherty 
was named to the preseason 
All-Big Ten team, the first 
Wolverine 
to 
earn 
that 

distinction since LeeAnn Bies 
received the same honors 
14 years ago. Flaherty was a 
unanimous pick for the All-
Big Ten squad, one of just five 
players to earn that distinction 
this season.

But adulation for Flaherty 

has not been limited to those 
inside the Big Ten.

She was also put on the 

preseason watch list for the 
Nancy Lieberman Award, an 
honor given to the NCAA’s best 
point guard. Among returning 
players, Flaherty ranked third 
in the nation in scoring in 
2015-16.

As if all of that weren’t 

enough, she was even picked as 
a preseason fourth-team All-
American by Sporting News. 
Flaherty 
received 
an 
All-

American honorable mention 
by the Women’s Basketball 
Coaches’ Association at the 
end of last year.

While 
she 
already 
has 

multiple 
Michigan 
team 

records 
under 
her 
belt, 

Flaherty appears poised to 
break more as she still has two 
years of eligibility remaining. 
She currently ranks third in 
Wolverine history in scoring 

average with 18 points, 10th 
in total points with 1273, 
fourth in 3-pointers with 183 
and second in free-throw 
percentage at .879.

Flaherty will not be the only 

source of offensive firepower 
for Michigan, though.

Sophomore center Hallie 

Thome 
and 
senior 
guard 

Siera Thompson, who ranked 
second and third, respectively, 
in scoring for the Wolverines 
in 2015-16, will be back in 
action this season. Freshman 
guard 
Kysre 
Gondrezick 

also figures to factor into 
Michigan’s offense, as she 
scored a state-record 72 points 
in a game for Benton Harbor 
High School.

But 
even 
with 
that 

strong supporting cast, the 
Wolverines’ scoring will not 
live up to its potential without 
Flaherty’s 
outstanding 

offensive output.

during Michigan’s 
2016-17 campaign.

STAFF PICKS


Michigan needs more from its offense

I

t took just three seconds for 
Alex Kile to score a goal that 
ranks among the best of this 

young season.

The senior forward emerged 

from a routine 
scrum near 
the boards 
with the puck, 
surrounded 
on the ice 
by all five 
Michigan Tech 
players. With 
no teammates 
near, he evaded 
one defender 
before falling 
to his knees and sliding toward 
the net.

And somehow, despite losing 

his balance, he deked out Huskie 
goaltender Matt Wintjes and 
poked the puck into the net to 
give No. 11 Michigan a 2-1 lead. It 
was an amazing individual effort 
— the type that will find its way 
onto postseason highlight reels.

But the incredible goal from 

Michigan’s co-captain only 
illustrated the problem facing the 
Wolverines early on this season: 
an offense that lacks cohesion 
and has relied on a steady diet 
of individual performances like 
Kile’s to stay afloat.

Sure, Michigan has a 3-1-1 

record through five games, and 
no one expected the Wolverines 
to replicate the lethal attack 
they had last season, when they 
averaged 4.76 goals per game on 
the strength of perhaps the best 
line in all of college hockey.

If Michigan hopes to finish 

in the top half of the Big Ten, 
though — let alone make it back 
to the postseason — it will need 
to develop a more consistent 
approach when it has the puck.

Perhaps some sporadic 

moments from players new to 
their roles are to be expected.

The standout performances 

from new contributors have 
been a pleasant surprise. A more 
sustainable model of success, 
though, would be more efficient 
play across the board.

The Wolverines have been 

outshot in all five games, and 
while shots don’t often tell 
the whole story, Michigan has 
struggled to move or possess 

the puck, tallying a Corsi For 
percentage (a measure of puck 
possession) of just 37.5 thus far.

The Wolverines’ average 

goals per game and power-play 
percentage don’t tell the full 
story, either. Michigan averages 
3.20 goals per game — good for 
25th in the nation — and has 
converted on 
24 percent of its 
power plays, but 
there are far too 
many instances 
during both even-
strength play and 
on the power play 
when the attack 
stagnates. Shots 
are few and far 
between and 
Wolverines skate 
up and down the ice, aimlessly 
chasing dumped pucks.

Possession was rare in 

Saturday’s game against 
Michigan Tech, when the 
Huskies controlled the puck 
and subdued Michigan with an 
aggressive forecheck — a tactic 
that both Union and Ferris 
State, Michigan’s previous two 
opponents, also utilized to great 
effect.

Michigan Tech 

ended with a 
27-shot advantage, 
peppering 45 
shots on goal 
compared to 
just 18 from the 
Wolverines.

To Michigan’s 

credit, this isn’t an 
issue that’s new 
to them, and the 
players have been 

working on correcting it. They 
know that being outplayed for 
most of the game won’t always 

lead to wins or ties, and they’ve 
already heard from coach Red 
Berenson and the rest of the staff.

“I mean, let’s face it, we 

haven’t played the best teams in 
the country yet,” Kile said after 
Saturday’s game. “Once we play 
Minnesota, Ohio State and Penn 
State, we can’t play like this, or 
else we’re going to lose.

“We’re going through some 

growing pains, and we’re trying 
to find our chemistry right now. 
But I think we’re going to get 
better. We got outplayed both 
games this weekend, and we 
were lucky to come out on top 
last night and get the shootout 
win today.”

Michigan freshman netminder 

Jack LaFontaine, whose 42-save 
performance Saturday helped 
his team escape with the tie, was 
more positive when it came to 
evaluating his team.

“We’re a very clutch team,” 

LaFontaine said. “When the 
going gets tough, we get tougher. 
And I think that’s good. But 
today, coach Berenson was 
talking about how we have to 
play a full 60 (minutes), and 
I personally see it as a silver 
lining. If we can do this in the 
third period, what’s going to 
happen in a couple months with 
the first and second periods?”

And it’s hard to argue with 

LaFontaine. It’s difficult to know 
just how good this team could be 
if it sharpens up offensively.

But what’s clearer is what 

the result will be if Michigan 
continues to play inconsistently 
into the bulk of its schedule — a 
lot fewer wins and draws.

Wolverines’ young players have stepped in well so far, but team must improve consistency for the long haul

Senior forward Alex Kile and Michigan have strung together some clutch goals in their five games this season, but the Wolverines still need to improve their puck movement.

De Jong becomes comfortable in new role

For those who grow up in 

Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, 
hockey is nearly a birthright. So 
almost since he was born, Nolan 
De Jong has been itching to start 
playing the sport.

His father, Kevin De Jong, played 

in a men’s league, and Nolan would 
go to his games with his mother and 
brother to watch.

“His deal with me was that if I 

was potty-trained, if I could use a 
toilet, then he would teach me how 
to skate,” De Jong said. “That was 
his deal with me, because I wanted 
to play hockey so bad, because I saw 
him playing and watched it on TV 
and everything.”

From there, De Jong never looked 

back. He played in a minor league in 
his hometown and began improving 
his craft. And it didn’t take long for 
De Jong to realize that he might 
have a future in hockey.

Years later, De Jong is living that 

future in Ann Arbor.

Before every game, the Michigan 

hockey 
team 
crowds 
around 

the goal. Players drape over the 
back of the net, and the starting 
goalie crouches in the crease. The 
Children of Yost give another round 
of the “Let’s Go Blue” chant to the 
tune of the pep band, and the rest of 
the fans get louder in anticipation 
for puck drop. But among all the 
commotion, the players are silent. 
All the players, that is, except one: 
De Jong.

De Jong gives the final pep talk 

before the puck drops, visibly 
bobbing 
his 
head, 
giving 
his 

teammates 
encouraging 
words 

before they take the ice against 
their opponents.

In some ways, this position seems 

an obvious endpoint for the boy 
who started skating at that Victoria 
rink at age 2. In reality, it’s not that 
simple.

***

De Jong has always felt the 

passion that he now exhibits as 
a captain of the Wolverines. And 
when he was a child, that passion 
paired with physical ability to start 
him on the right track.

“I always knew I was one of the 

better, more competitive guys from 
pretty much when I was 6 or 7,” De 
Jong said. “Me and my best friend 
(American International College 
forward Shawn McBride), we would 
just kind of get the puck and we 
could skate through everyone at a 
pretty young age.

McBride further attested to De 

Jong’s hard work: “He was tons of 
fun to hang out with and be around, 
but then when it came time to work 
hard, he was the hardest-working 
guy. That’s a lot like he is today, and 

that’s how he was back then.”

De Jong’s hard work translated 

to early notice from colleges. Before 
he had even played his first game 
in junior hockey, De Jong received 
his first offer from Cornell. And 
from a school with such academic 
and hockey prestige, that offer was 
enough for De Jong. He committed 
to play for the Big Red, and 
Michigan moved its focus to other 
recruits.

Michigan knew about De Jong 

in those days. In fact, Wolverines 

assistant coach Brian Wiseman 
went to his British Columbia to take 
a look at him. But when Wiseman 
arrived, he soon found out about De 
Jong’s commitment to Cornell, and 
Michigan went home packing.

The pursuit wasn’t over, though. 

Once De Jong and his family took 
a deeper look into the financial 
prospects at an Ivy League school, 
they reconsidered their options.

“Cornell doesn’t do scholarships 

because they’re Ivy League,” Kevin 
De Jong said. “And when it came 
down to that, we were looking at 
either paying a bunch of money for 
him to go there, or he said, ‘There’s 
probably other opportunities,’ and 
Michigan was at the top of the list.”

When the Wolverines caught 

wind of De Jong’s decommitment, 
they pounced.

“It was about a year later that 

we had heard he decommitted with 
Cornell,” Berenson said. “So then 
he was available. And we knew 
enough about him to go ahead and 
recruit him.”

***

For 
De 
Jong, 
the 
move 
to 

Michigan wasn’t easy. He had spent 
his entire life in Victoria, even 
playing juniors for the hometown 
Victoria Grizzlies of the British 
Columbia Hockey League. So when 
he came to Ann Arbor, it was the 

first time De Jong had to spend an 
extended period of time away from 
home.

“In 
hindsight, 
it’s 
a 
funny 

situation,” De Jong said. “(My 
parents) basically packed me up and 
put my life in a few suitcases and a 
hockey bag and said, ‘There you 
go.’ You kind of get thrown into it a 
little bit, but I’m glad it worked out 
that way.”

But De Jong wasn’t necessarily 

alone. He came to Ann Arbor as 
a part of a vaunted recruiting 
class that included 11 players. The 
shining stars in the class were 

JT Compher and Tyler Motte. 
They were fresh off a stint with 
the United States National Team 
Development Program, a team that 
is made up every year of the most 
talented players in the country. 
Even 
Michael 
Downing 
was 

considered a superior defenseman 
to De Jong entering college. So it 
wasn’t expected that De Jong would

have to be a star right away.

And that turned out to be the 

case, at least early on. De Jong 
struggled in his first two years at 
Michigan, tallying just nine points 
— all on assists — in two seasons 
over 52 games.

“Things have not been easy for 

Nolan,” Berenson said. “He came 
here and he ran into a wall, and it 
was a big jump for him, and in terms 
of his confidence and his role on the 
team and how he played and how he 
expected to play. And he had a hard 
time living up to that.”

The rest of De Jong’s recruiting 

class, meanwhile, played starring 
roles. 
Compher 
and 
Motte 

developed statistically into two 
of the best forwards in Wolverine 
history. And heading into this 
season, it was expected that those 
two would return to play in their 
senior 
seasons 
with 
De 
Jong 

and company — especially after 
Berenson announced he would also 
return after speculations of his 
retirement.

They didn’t stay, though. Instead, 

Compher, Motte and even Downing 

all opted to head to the NHL, and 
Michigan was left with holes to fill.

“I was really close, especially with 

JT and (Motte), so it’s weird,” De Jong 
said. “It didn’t really kick in until we 
were doing summer workouts and 
running the stadium and doing all of 
the stuff where I’m so used to having 
them there in the locker room. So 
it was a little bit bizarre, and that’s 
where it started to set in, like, ‘Where 
are those guys?’ ”

Once those players left, there 

were questions of who would step 
up as a scorer, who would fill in on 
the defensive blue line and, maybe 
most 
importantly, 
who 
would 

reveal themselves as the team’s 
leader. And as the season crept 
closer, those questions persisted.

In preseason interviews and 

press conferences, senior forward 
Alex Kile was pegged as a likely 
candidate to fill some of those roles. 
After all, he was the team’s leading 
returning scorer and, as a senior, 
it made sense for him to be the 
mouthpiece for the team. However, 
when captains were announced in 
early October, some were surprised 

to see that Kile would be serving 
as a co-captain along with fellow 
senior De Jong.

Those 
on 
the 
team 
weren’t 

surprised at all, though. Even De 
Jong had a hunch that he might get 
the nod along with Kile.

“I expected it,” De Jong said. 

“Me and Alex took responsibility, 
because there’s a lot of stuff that 
happens behind the scenes. We 
were coordinating times and doing 
team events and things like that 
even during spring and summer.”

Added senior goaltender Zach 

Nagelvoort, a roommate of De 
Jong’s: “Just talking about captains 
we’ve had here, we’ve had a range 
of different guys since I’ve been 
here. We’ve had guys that are very 
vocal, we’ve had guys that aren’t 
super vocal, but they just lead by 
what they do every single day, and 
I think Nolan does a good job of 
embodying both of those things.”

A good captain can only do so 

much, though, and De Jong has 
his own limitations. He has never 
scored a goal while playing for 
Michigan — something that his 
teammates jokingly remind him of.

“We definitely give him a hard 

time about that,” Nagelvoort said. 
“Personally I would love to see him 
put up a couple of goals this year. I 
think that would be awesome. But 
it’s a hockey team — you’ve got to 
have thick skin, and we definitely 
give him a hard time.”

Of course, De Jong realizes 

scoring 
goals 
isn’t 
his 
most 

important job. In his eyes, building 
team camaraderie will lead to the 
most success for the team. And with 
a freshman-laden roster this year, 
that task has become even more 
important for him.

“People keep talking like, ‘What 

are you going to do about the 
scoring?’ and ‘What are you going 
to do about this or that?’,” De Jong 
said. “But I think if we have a hard-
working team that’s extremely tight 
at the rink and hangs out away from 
the rink, that’s going to make us a 
better team than anything.”

But De Jong has clearly filled 

his new role with grace. He doesn’t 
have to put in extra effort to get 
along with younger teammates 
or lead by example — that comes 
naturally to him.

“I can go talk to anybody at any 

time,” he said. “It’s never awkward 
if it’s just me and one guy. We have 
something to talk about. We have 
something in common, so it’s pretty 
easy, with the group of guys we 
have, to be friends with everyone.”

***

Now De Jong is a co-captain 

on an extremely young Michigan 
team, and the pressure is now 
firmly on him. With all of the 
attrition that the Wolverines face 
this season, he is one of the most 
experienced players on the roster. 
And, despite never scoring a goal in 
college, he’s going to be expected to 

produce now.

But with this being his senior 

season, De Jong isn’t worried. 
Instead, he’s more focused on 
taking everything in.

“We have so many alumni come 

in and talk to us, and the coaches 
talk to us, and every single guy says 
how fast it goes by,” De Jong said. 
“So I do my best to try and take it 
in. But at the same time, I know 
it’s not really going to hit me until 
I leave and kind of realize what we 
had here.”

That sentiment was made evident 

this weekend, when De Jong’s 
parents came to visit him. They 
have only visited a few times total 
over De Jong’s career, but this 
season they are making an effort to 
see him more.

After 
both 
practices 
on 

Wednesday 
and 
Thursday, 
the 

three gathered just off the ice. De 
Jong sat on the bleachers with one 
foot up next to him. He smiled and 
nodded along with his parents as he 
stared out onto the ice, watching 
his teammates finish up their days 
with shooting and skating drills.

De Jong has seen it all. He’s 

been a top-three defenseman in 
terms of points on a playoff team 
in the BCHL, he’s been a freshman 
fighting for ice time 2,000 miles 
away from home, and now, he’s the 
top defenseman for the 11th-ranked 
Wolverines.

But after all of that, De Jong is 

clearly in his element. It’s his turn 
now. And the people who know him 
best have taken notice of that.

“Each year he’s gotten more 

comfortable there,” McBride said. 
“I feel like he’s ready for this. He 
wanted this, and he’s got it now, and 
he’s going to run with it.”

“Things have 
not been easy 

for Nolan.”

De Jong played in just 52 games in his first two seasons before breaking out last year and

Big Ten Breakdown: Minnesota, Ohio 
State provide strongest competition

After losing nearly two thirds 

of its scoring to graduation 
and 
the 
NHL, 
the 
No. 
13 

Michigan hockey team will face 
difficulties in repeating as Big 
Ten 
champions. 
Minnesota, 

Wisconsin and Ohio State each 
enter the season with lineups 
heavy on experience, and nearly 
every contending team returns a 
top-five Big Ten scorer.

It will be challenging for the 

young and raw Wolverines to 
compete in a conference with four 
ranked teams. The Daily broke 
down the Big Ten in 2016, teams 
listed in order of predicted finish.

Minnesota (No. 12)

The Golden Gophers won last 

year’s Big Ten season title by 
only one point over second-place 
Michigan. Returning from that 
winning team are forward Justin 
Kloos, who tallied 43 points — 
the most of anyone not named 
Kyle Connor, JT Compher or 
Tyler Motte — and Leon Bristedt, 
who scored 20 goals, the most of 
any player who returned to the 
Big Ten this season. In the net, 
Minnesota 
returns 
freshman 

standout Eric Schierhorn, who 
played the most games and 
minutes in the crease of any 
goaltender in the conference 
last season. Both Kloos and 
Schierhorn earned unanimous 
All-Big Ten preseason watch list 
selections, while Bristedt also 
received a spot on the list.

With 
so 
much 
preseason 

promise, the Golden Gophers 
have disappointed so far, opening 
this year 2-2 with two losses 
to then-No. 14 St. Cloud State 
last weekend. Minnesota will 
face top-ranked North Dakota, 
No. 18 St. Lawrence and No. 9 
Minnesota State to finish up 
their extremely challenging non-
conference slate.

The Golden Gophers begin 

conference play with a series 
against Ohio State at home. 

This series will pit two between 
the teams projected to lead the 
Big Ten, and could determine 
whether the Golden Gophers 
will defend their season title or 
fall prey to the just as deep and 
experienced Buckeyes.

Ohio State (No. 15)

Through 
three 
weeks 
of 

hockey, the Buckeyes remain 
the Big Ten’s only undefeated 
team. Ohio State returns two 
top offensive players from last 
season: forward Nick Schilkey, 
who scored 19 goals, and David 
Gust, who earned 36 points, good 
for ninth in the Big Ten. Standout 
sophomore wing Mason Jobst is 
also back in Columbus after a first 
year in which he bagged 19 goals. 
Schilkey has already tabbed four 

goals and two assists to lead the 
Buckeyes in their first few games 
this season. Both Schilkey and 
Jobst were named to the All-Big 
Ten Preseason watch list along 
with defenseman Josh Healey, 
who has garnered four assists in 
five games.

Ohio State opened its season 

with an impressive 3-2 victory 
over Denver and defeated Air 
Force and Miami (OH), two 
teams that earned votes in this 
week’s USCHO’s rankings. The 
Buckeyes success stems from 
their 10th-ranked defense, which 
has allowed just 2.20 goals per 
game and their equally potent 
offensive attack that averages 
3.60 goals.

The series with Minnesota 

will prove to be one of the 
more important sets of games 

in conference play this year. In 
theory, it could show whether the 
Golden Gophers or the Buckeyes 
have the early edge in the season 
standings and send a message to 
their fellow conference members 
as to which is the team to beat.

Wisconsin

Last 
season, 
the 
Badgers 

finished dead last in the Big 
Ten, accumulating just three 
wins in conference play and 
earning eight total victories. This 
season, though, Wisconsin seems 
primed for a rebound, splitting 
its first two series with Northern 
Michigan and No. 8 Boston 
College. The Badgers return their 
top two offensive leaders from 
last season, forwards Luke Kunin 
— drafted by the Minnesota 

Wild — and Grant Besse, Kunin 
earned a unanimous All-Big Ten 
Preseason watch list selection 
by scoring 19 goals in last year’s 
campaign, and Besse tallied 22 
assists. Also returning on the 
offensive front is Seamus Malone, 
who finished last season with 21 
assists and, through four games 
thus far, currently ranks second 
in the Big Ten in total points 
with six. Freshman standout 
Matt Jurusik mans the crease for 
Wisconsin, and the Badgers hope 
he will improve upon last year’s 
performance in which he allowed 
114 goals, the most of any Big Ten 
netminder.

Through 
just 
two 
series, 

Wisconsin 
has 
shown 

tremendous improvement from 
last season, when it took seven 
games for the Badgers to earn a

JAMES COLLER/Daily

The Michigan hockey team won its first Big Ten Tournament title last year, but the Wolverines must overcome Ohio State and Minnesota to repeat this year.


win. And because of its success 
thus far in this campaign, the 
rankings rewarded Wisconsin, 
which received six votes in last 
weekend’s USCHO’s poll.

Wisconsin is led by new coach 

Tony Granato, who played for 
the Badgers and later in the 
NHL, in which he scored 30+ 
goals four times. Before arriving 
in Madison, Granato worked as 
an assistant for the Detroit Red 
Wings.

Wisconsin will play against 

No. 6 Denver, a team that ranks 
seventh in goals allowed with 
just two per game. As such an 
offensive-minded 
team, 
the 

Badgers could be challenged 
if Jurusik and the defense 
continue to struggle as they 
did two weeks ago when they 
allowed nine goals in two games 
to Boston College. 

Penn State (No. 19)

Penn 
State 
brings 
back 

forward David Goodwin, who 
finished third in the conference 
with 27 assists, and forward 
Andrew Sturtz, who scored 18 
goals last season.

Thus far, the two have picked 

up right where they left off, 
with Goodwin notching three 
assists 
through 
five 
games 

and Sturtz netting four goals. 
The 
Nittany 
Lions, 
though, 

will need to replace netminder 
Eamon McAdam, who finished 
second in the Big Ten in save 

percentage with a .913 clip and 
averaged 28.7 saves per game. 
Thus far, Penn State has turned 
to freshman Peyton Jones, who 
ranks fourth in the conference 
with a .916 save percentage and 
has earned wins in all three of 
his completed games to anchor 
the net.

The Nittany Lions entered the 

USCHO rankings for the first 
time this season at the No. 19 slot 
after impressive wins over No. 7 
Notre Dame and St. Lawrence. 
Penn State finished third in the 
Big Ten last season and split 
the season’s series with both 
Minnesota and Ohio State. It 
looks to be trending upward this 
year, but it will be interesting to 
see how the Nittany Lions fare 
once conference play begins.

Michigan State

The 
Spartans 
lost 
their 

top scorer from last season, 
MacKenzie MacEachern, who 
signed a contract with the St. 
Louis Blues. Also departed is 
netminder Jake Hildebrand — 
who gave Michigan problems in 
the past — and forward Michael 
Ferrantino. They return junior 
forward and captain Joe Cox, 
who finished last year with 23 
points. 

Michigan State is clearly in 

rebuilding mode with 10 new 
freshmen entering its system. 
For now, though, the cellar seems 
likely in such a competitive 
conference and a schedule that 
has seen the Spartans begin 
the year 0-4 after facing No. 
3 Denver and surging Lake 
Superior State.

Its games will not get any 

easier. The Spartans face off 
against top-ranked North Dakota 
in Grand Forks next month and 
begin conference play with a 
series against No. 12 Minnesota 
in East Lansing.

In its four games, Michigan 

State has struggled offensively, 
scoring just six goals while 
allowing 18. Its power play is 
nearly nonexistent with just two 
goals on 28 attempts, and its 
penalty killing isn’t much better. 
The Spartans rank 52nd overall 
in that category. A bright spot is 
defenseman Zach Osburn, who 
leads Michigan State in shots 
and points with 16 and two, 
respectively.

This season could be even 

worse than last year for the 
Spartans, when they finished 
10-23-4, good for fifth in the 
conference.

Roster breakdown: ‘M’ trying to 
replace CCM line, other losses

Already 
five 
games 
into 

the 2016-17 season, the No. 11 
Michigan hockey team has a 
lot to break down. The team 
features 11 freshmen in addition 
to 17 returning players, which 
has made much of the season a 
learning curve so far.

After the Wolverines lost some 

of their top scorers last season 
— including Kyle Connor, Tyler 
Motte and JT Compher — the 
team is looking to replenish some 
of the offensive initiative it lost 
last year.

And while Michigan has yet 

to solidify lines and a starting 
goaltender, it’s clear from the 
Wolverines’ first five games that 
they have been attempting to fill 
this void. With a few individual 
freshmen 
standing 
out 
early 

on and many returning players 
assisting in the 3-1-1 record, 
Michigan’s 
roster 
showcases 

plenty of potential.

Goaltenders

Even after five games, it’s 

still unclear which player is 

going to be saddled with the 
full-time responsibility of being 
the starting goaltender for the 
Wolverines.

Three of the four goaltenders 

listed on Michigan’s roster have 
seen game time this year, and all 
three have looked solid in front of 
the net.

Returning 
senior 
Zach 

Nagelvoort 
recorded 
a 
.929 

and .906 save percentage his 
freshman and sophomore years, 
respectively. His junior year, 
however he only played in 11 
games after Steve Racine claimed 
the job. This year, he’s in the 
running to take the job back.

Nagelvoort has only guarded 

the 
net 
twice 
this 
season, 

one of which was in the first 
period of the exhibition against 
Windsor, where he tallied seven 
saves and recorded an assist. 
The other was in the season 
opener against Union, where 
he recorded 36 saves. But even 
though the game ended in a 4-3 
loss, Nagelvoort looked solid in 
front of the net and has the most 
experience among the rest of the 
goaltenders, which makes him 
one of the strongest candidates 
for the starting spot.

Freshman Jack LaFontaine 

has quite noticeably made a 
name for himself in the position 
as well. He made his collegiate 
debut during the third period of 
the Windsor exhibition, where 
he recorded 12 saves.

It wasn’t until the Wolverines’ 

first road match, however, that 
LaFontaine truly put himself in 
the running for the position. In a 
close match against Ferris State, 
LaFontaine saved 28 of 29 shots 
for a 2-1 win over the Bulldogs. 
He also saw game time in the 
3-3 tie against Michigan Tech 
on Saturday, when he collected 
42 saves.

The final goaltender who has 

seen action this season is Hayden 
Lavigne. The freshman recorded 
13 saves in the exhibition against 
Windsor and 31 saves in both his 
first collegiate debut in a shutout 
against Union and in Michigan’s 
4-3 win over the Huskies on 
Friday.

All three goaltenders have 

modest records behind them, and 
it’s unclear which one will take 
the position. They’ve all proven 
they can handle being in between 
the pipes — so far.

Forwards

Motte, Compher and Connor 

didn’t just pace Michigan on 
offense last year. They became one 
of the most prolific lines in college 
hockey.

All three players are gone now, 

leaving a young team to try to 
replace them.

One member of that young 

team is freshman forward Will 
Lockwood. 
Lockwood’s 
father 

was a part of Michigan coach 
Red Berenson’s first four year-
class and scored a total of 69 goals 
throughout his career — and so 
far, it looks like his son is living up 
to the family legacy.

Lockwood — a former member 

of the United States National 
Team 
Development 
Program 

with current teammate Luke 
Martin — has already notched 
three goals and three assists this 
season and has been a consistent 
name on the first line. Off the 
stat sheet, he’s known for being 
speedy on the ice and it looks as if 
he is acclimating well to the pace 
of college hockey.

Coming 
off 
of 
a 
season 

captaining 
the 
Bloomington 

Thunder of the United States 
Hockey League, forward Jake 
Slaker had a record of 21 goals and 
21 assists in 57 games. So far this 
year, he’s matched Lockwood’s 
total of three assists and three 
goals and has been a consistent 
name on the first line.

And then there’s senior captain 

Alex Kile, and though he’s only 
scored a single goal so far this 
season, he has been a constant 
presence on the ice. And his 
experience from the previous 
season, when he scored 16 goals 

and recorded 18 assists, puts him 
in good position for the team to 
lean on.

Freshman James Sanchez has 

recorded two goals in a single 
game in the shutout against 
Union and looks to be solid as 
well, generally sitting on the 
second or third line with two 
senior forwards, Evan Allen and 
Max Shuart. Shuart has scored 
a single goal this season, but has 
capitalized on opportunities for 
assists.

Sophomore Brendan Warren 

and juniors Dexter Dancs and 
Tony Calderone have also made 
offensive contributions so far this 
season.

Defensemen

Michigan 
also 
suffered 

significant losses on defense, 
with 
Michael 
Downing 
and 

Zach Werenski turning pro. But 

a few new defensive recruits in 
addition to the returning class 
offer an optimistic look for the 
Wolverines.

Nolan De Jong is highlighting 

the returning class, and has 
taken on a captain position for 
the season. De Jong led the 
defense last season, playing in 
every game and leading all Big 
Ten defensemen. As one of the 
captains of the team this year, he’s 
been a significant factor in the 
success of the younger team.

Junior defenseman Sam Piazza 

is one of the top returners this 
season as well. In the past five 
games, he has scored three goals 
and tallied two assists, a clear 
indicator he is attempting to fill 
the void left behind from last 
year’s top scorers.

Juniors Cutler Martin and Niko 

Porikos have also each scored 
a goal, and sophomore Joseph 
Cecconi tallied an assist.

Christian 
Meike, 
Griffin 

Luce and Luke Martin are all 
newcomers for the defense.

With strong returners leading 

the defense, the freshmen have a 
good opportunity to learn what 
they need to in order to help 
fill the shoes of Werenski and 
Downing.

***

Overall, Michigan has a lot of 

potential to work with. Despite 
the abundance of fresh faces, 
many of the freshmen have 
earned their place on the roster. 
The team has some kinks it needs 
to work out after getting outshot 
in each of its first five games. 
But with a few more weeks 
before conference play begins, 
the Wolverines have a little bit 
of time to find the chemistry 
they need to capitalize on their 
individual talents.

Freshman forward Will Lockwood has been tasked with picking up some of the scoring load on Michigan’s first line after forwards Tyler Motte, JT Compher and Kyle Connor each went to the NHL after last season.
