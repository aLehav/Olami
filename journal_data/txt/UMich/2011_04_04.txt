Campus rinking patterns
hard to define, officials say

Judy Shepard
urges campus to
support LGBT
community
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
With inspiring stories, a
passionate theatrical perfor-
mance and afilm evoking tears
from the audience, about 130
people gathered on Saturday
evening to hear testimonies
about prejudice against the
LGBTQ community across the
nation.
At the presentation in Blau
Auditorium, Judy Shepard
shared the story of her son
Matthew's death that resulted
from a hate crime in 1998. MSA
President Chris Armstrong
and University alum Jim Toy,
founder of the University's
Spectrum Center, were also
honored for their activism on
LGBTQ issues.
In her presentation, Shepa-
rd explained that she became
an activist after her son's

death when she began the
Matthew Shepard Foundation
on the anniversary of her son's
birthday Dec. 1,;in 1998.
Shepard said one of the most
integral steps in furthering the
rights of the LGBTQ commu-
nity is to educate people and
bring the issues to the fore-
front, emphasizing the crucial
role of allies in the fight.
Armstrong is the first MSA
president in the student gov-
ernment's history to be openly
gay. At the event he received
an award from the Jim Toy
Community Center for his
composure and resilience
when dealing with harassment
by former Michigan assis-
tant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell, who created a blog
that targeted Armstrong for
his sexual orientation and
accused him of having a "radi-
cal sexual agenda."
In February, Armstrong's
attorney Deborah Gordon told
The Michigan Daily that she
and Armstrong intend to file
a civil lawsuit against Shirvell
if he does not recant his state-
ments.

'U' hosts alcohol-
free activities as
party alternative
By CLAIRE HALL
DailyStaffReporter
Instead of grabbing a cup of
jungle juice on Friday nights,
many students choose free food

at the Michigan Union, accom-
panied by a movie screening or
singing karaoke.
The free weekend activities
are part of UMix, a University-
sponsored event that takes place
every other week. While it was
originally instituted as an alter-
native to drinking on Friday
nights, University officials say it
is unclear whether UMix has had
a significantimpact on the rate of

underage drinking on campus
since it began almost five years
ago.
Though binge drinking on
campus decreased from 2007
to 2009, there has been an
increase in the number of stu-
dents brought to the University
hospital for drinking this year
compared to last year. There has
also been a rise in the number of
violations reported to University

offices related to alcohol educa-
tion and conflict resolution. But
due to several factors, University
officials say it is hard to deter-
mine the actual patterns of stu-
dents' drinking in the last few
years.
Eric Heilmeier, program
adviser for University Unions
Arts and Programs who oversees
the UMix program, said UMix

The University Senate at
Columbia University voted last
Friday to overturn a ban on
ROTC from campus. The ban
had been in place since 1969,
according to an April 1 article in
The New York Times.
The decision came after the
Columbia University Senate
created the Task Force on Mili-
tary Engagement, according to
the article. The task force was
formed after President Barack
Obama signed the "don't ask,
don't tell" repeal act.
Not all students and faculty
are in favor of the change, but
some Columbia University stu-
dents spoke positively about
ending the ban.
"The conversation between

the military and the university
has traveled through an arc,"
Columbia University Student
N. Rudy Rickner told The New
York Times. "Veterans and
people who come here to study
have not always had the kind
of interaction they should have
had for the last 30 years. Now
they will."

SPONSORS LAW SEMINAR
ON BOB DYLAN'S SONGS
Tonight and tomorrow a
group of scholars will discuss
the influence of Bob Dylan's
songs at a seminar called "Bob
Dylan and the Law," organized
by Fordham University's Louis

Stein Center for Law and Ethics
and Touro Law School, accord-
ing to an April 2 Associated
Press article.
Fordham University Prof.
Bruce Green, one of the orga-
nizers of the event, asked Dylan
fans to write about how the
law and Dylan's lyrics relate,
according to the AP.
"We think it's important once
in a while to have fun, and to
free the scholarly imagination,"
Green told the AP. "It's a lens
through which to look at the
relationship between law, soci-
ety and culture. We hope it leads
some scholars to think things
they haven't thought before."

Adoptions of HI V-positive children
on the rise among American parents

"Stigma is steadily
lessening" toward
HIV/AIDS
The immediate task might be
coaxing a toddler into one more
swallow of nasty-tasting medica-
tion. Longer term, there are tough
choices to be made about telling
that child - and the surround-
ing community - why those daily
doses maybe needed for the rest of
his orher life.
While most adoptions present
challenges, there's a distinctive set
of them facing parents who decide
to adopt children living with HIV.
A twice-daily medication regi-
men, lingering prejudice and fear,
uncertainty about the child's lon-

gevity and marriage prospects.
Yet the number of U.S. parents
undertaking HIV adoptions, or
seriously considering them, is
surging - from a trickle five years
ago to at least several hundred.
Most involve orphans from for-
eign countries where they faced
stigma, neglect and the risk of
early death.
"I can't think of a more signifi-
cant way to make an impact than
to do this," said Margaret Fleming,
a 74-year-old Chicagoan whose
nine adopted children include
three HIV-positive first graders.
"These kids were, in many
ways, the modern-day lepers," she
said.
Ignorance and bias related to
HIV haven't vanished in the Unit-
ed States. But the stigma is steadi-

ly lessening, especially compared
to many of the other countries that
are home to an estimated 2.5 mil-
lion children with the disease.
At forums and overthe Internet,
parents who have adopted HIV-
positive kids are offering advice
and encouragement to those who
might follow suit. In February,
Bethany Christian Services - the
largest U.S. adoption agency -
unveiled a detailed educational
package about HIV adoptions
to help the growing number of
interested parents make informed.
decisions.
"We didn't feel we could ethi-
cally place these kids without
some really solid education for
these families," said Sara Ruiter,
Bethany's international services
coordinator.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- Afghan protests against the
burning of a Quran in Florida
entered a third day with a dem-
onstration in a major eastern
city yesterday, while the Tali-
ban called on people to rise up,
blaming government forces for
any violence.
The desecration at a small
U.S. church has outraged Mus-
lims worldwide, and in Afghani-
stan many ofthe demonstrations
have turned into deadly riots.
Protests in the north and south
in recent days have killed 20
people.
Yesterday's protest in Jalala-
bad city was peaceful, with hun-
dreds of people blocking a main
highway for three hours, shout-
ing for U.S. troops to leave and
burning an effigy of President
Barack Obama before dispers-
ing, according to an Associated

countries have wrongly excused
the burning a Quran by the pas-
tor of a Florida church on March
20 as freedom of speech and
that Afghans "cannot accept
this un-Islamic act."
On Saturday, U.S. President
Barack Obama extended his
condolences to the families
of those killed by the protest-
ers and said desecration of the
Quran "is an act of extreme
intolerance and bigotry." But he
said that does not justify attack-
ing and killing innocent people,
calling it "outrageous and an
affront to human decency and
dignity."
Eleven were killed Friday
when demonstrators stormed a
U.N. compound, including seven
foreign U.N. employees.
A riot Saturday in south-
ern Kandahar city resulted in
nine deaths and more than 80
injured.
The Taliban statement said

order of the foreign torces
attacked unarmed people dur-
ing the protests, killing them
and arresting some, saying
there were armed people among
these protesters, which was not
true," the statement said.
Sher Jan Durani, a spokesman
for the government of northern
Balkh province, where the first
riots occurred, said there were
multiple armed men among the
more than 20 arrested. Afghan
authorities suspect insurgents
infiltrated the mob.
In Kandahar, officials said 17
people, including seven armed
men, have been arrested.
The protests come at a critical
juncture as the U.S.-led coali-
tion gears up for an insurgent
spring offensive and a summer
withdrawal of some troops, and
with Afghanistan's mercurial
president increasingly question-
ing international motives and
NATO's military strategy.

Southwest Airlines cancelled
about 600 flights this week-
end as the airline continues its
inspection of 79 of its Boeing 737
aircraft, in the aftermath of an
emergency landing of one of its
planes on Friday.
The airline cancelled 300
flights yesterday after cancelling
the same number on Saturday.
Southwest Airlines spokeswom-

Southwest normally has about

it's slightly reduced on Saturday.
That means that almost 9 per-

were cancelled each of the two
days. No flights were cancelled
on Friday.

A strong earthquake hit off
Indonesia's main island of Java
today, prompting authorities to
briefly issue a tsunami warn-

residents fleeing their homes in
panic.
There were no immediate
reports of injuries or damage
from the 6.7-magnitude quake,
which struck shortly after 3 a.m.
today (2000 GMT, 4 p.m. EDT).
The U.S. Geological Survey
said the temblor was centered
318 kilometers (nearly 200 miles)
off southern Java, just 24 kilo-

ocean floor.
Thousands of people in the
town of Cilacap poured into the
streets and ran to high ground,

Disaster's after-math puts

Previously secret
account of 1942
mission unveiled
LONDON (AP) - The four
men wading ashore on a Flori-
da beach wearing nothing but
bathing trunks and German
army hats looked like an unlike-
ly invading force.
Declassified British intel-
ligence files describe how the
men were part of Nazi sabotage
teams sent to the U.S. in June
1942 to undermine the Ameri-
can war effort.
They were trained in bomb-
making, supplied with explo-
sives and instructed in how
to make timers from "easily
obtainable commodities such as
dried peas, lumps of sugar and
razor blades."
Fortunately for the U.S., they
were also spectacularly unsuc-
cessful.
"It was not brilliantly

planned," said Edward Hamp-
shire, a historian at Britain's
National Archives, which
released the wartime intelli-
gence documents Monday. "The
Germans picked the leader for
this very, very poorly. He imme-
diately wanted to give himself
up."
A detailed new account of the
mission - code-named Pasto-
rius after an early German set-
tler in the U.S. - is provided
in a report written in 1943 by
MI5 intelligence officer Victor
Rosthchild. It is one of a trove
of previously secret documents
which shed light on the Nazis'
desire to use sabotage, subter-
fuge and even poisoned sausages
to fight the war.
Pastorius was a mixture of
elaborate planning, bad luck and
human error.
Eight Germans who had lived
in the U.S. were dropped along
the Eastern seaboard - four on
Long Island, the rest south of
Jacksonville, Florida.

these youngsters once held as
normal is suddenly anything but.
"That's what is so wonder-
fully adaptive about children.
They can move very easily into
playing or laughing," says psy-
chologist Susie Burke, a disas-
ter response specialist with the
Australian Psychological Soci-
ety. "But that's not saying they're
not deeply distressed and upset
about what's going on."
Reminders of the tiniest vic-
tims are scattered throughout
the wreckage: a little girl's white
shoe caked in mud, a red rub-
ber ball coated in dust, a sodden
comic book whose ink has run.

As many as 25,000 people may
have been killed in the March 11
earthquake and tsunami that
devastated Japan's northeast
coast and damaged a nuclear
plant, sending radiation spew-
ing into the environment. Tens
of thousands are still living in
shelters.
For the children, the monster
in the closet has been replaced
by the monster of Mother
Nature: The ground they play on
can rattle and crack, the ocean
they swim in can morph into a
killer wave, the air they breathe
might carry harmful radioactive
particles.
Ten-year-old Fumie Unoura
remembers well the terror of
the day. She was sitting in class
when the earth began to shake,
sending her and her classmates
scrambling under their desks
for cover. When the rumbling
stopped, the teacher shepherded
the students outside, where their
town had turned to rubble.
"I saw the dust rising up,"
she recalled days later, standing
outside a shelter in the shattered
coastal city of Rikuzentakata.
With the tsunami coming, she
ran as fast as her short legs could
carry her, surrounded by others
sprinting for safety.
She escaped with her life but
little else. Her home is ruined.
She sleeps on the floor of a school
gym with her family and more
than a thousand other survivors.
She misses her Nintendo DS.
Her father, Masanari Unoura,
volunteers at the shelter. He wor-
ries constantly about what will
become of his life, where they
will live, how he will clean up the
ruins of their home.
"We parents have alot to think
about," he says. "Whereas the

kids are basically free."
It is not so simple, experts say.
In fact, the disruption of daily
life, if prolonged, can be more
damagingthanthe disaster itself,
says psychologist Gaithri Fer-
nando, who led a study on how
the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
affected children in Sri Lanka.
Suddenly discovering they
have no water to bathe, no bed of
their own and no school where
they can see their friends can be
highly upsetting, says Fernando,
a professor at California State
University in Los Angeles.
Experts say getting children
back into a routine - even an
unusual one - is key.
Unoura and his family are
doing this. Every morning, they
join others at the shelter for
group exercise sessions broad-
cast on the radio. They have
breakfast as a family, and then
Fumie and her older sister Shiho
have time to play until they all
meet for lunch. Fumie's teacher
stops by regularly with home-
work assignments - a source of
complaint for his daughter, her
father notes with a grin.
That kind of basic structure
to the day helps prevent long-
term psychological damage, says
Burke, the Australian psycholo-
gist.
"It gives them a sense that
their world is predictable, and
when we feel things are predict-
able, we beginto relax," she says.
"A disaster makes us realize or
think the world isn't predict-
able."
Save the Children, an inter-
national aid agency, has set up
safe spaces for children to meet
and play throughoutthe tsunami
zone, with toys, games, crayons
and paper.

U.S. Justice Department appeals
Florida judge's health care ruling

Department rules
health care plan
constitutional
ATLANTA (AP) - The fed-
eral health care overhaul's core
requirement to make virtually
all citizens buy health insurance
or face tax penalties is constitu-
tional because Congress has the
authority to regulate interstate
business, the Justice Department
said in its appeal of a ruling that
struck down the Obama admin-
istration's signature legislation.
The government's 62-page
motion filed Friday to the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals argued
that Congress had the power to
enact the overhaul's minimum
coverage requirements because
it is a "rational means of regulat-
ing the way participants in the
health care market pay for their
services."
The motion also warned other
pieces of the overhaul, includ-
ing a law that blocks insurers
from denying coverage to people
because of pre-existing condi-
tions, would be "unworkable"
without a minimum coverage
provision.
Twenty-six states filed a
lawsuit that said Congress had
exceeded its authority by requir-

ing that all citizens buy health
insurance or face tax penalties.
U.S. District Judge Roger Vin-
son of Florida agreed in a Jan. 31
ruling that said President Barack
Obama's entire health care over-
haulis unconstitutional.Itis con-
sidered the most sweeping ruling
against the health care law.
Vinson ruled against the over-
haul on grounds that Congress
exceeded its authority by requir-
ing nearly all Americans to carry
health insurance, an idea dating
back to Republican proposals
from the 1990s but now almost
universally rejected by conserva-
tives.
His ruling followed the same
reasoning as one last year f=rom
a federal judge in Virginia who
struck down the insurance
requirement. But while the first
judge left the rest of the law
intact, Vinson invalidated provi-
sions that range from Medicare
discounts for seniors with high
prescription costs to a change
that allows adult children up to
age 26 to remain on their parents'
coverage.
At the center ofVinson's ruling
and the government's challenge
is the legality of the requirement
that Americans carry health
insurance except in cases of
financial hardship. Those who
cannot show they are covered by

an employer, government pro-
gram or their own policy would
face fines from the IRS when the
program takes effect in 2014.
Vinson ruled that lawmakers
do not have the power to penalize
citizens for not doing something,
but the Justice Department said
he overreached.
The government disputedVin-
son's claim that Congress can't
penalize someone for not buy-
ing health care coverage, saying
the requirement was a "quintes-
sential exercise" of the legisla-
tive branch's powers. It said the
judge "impermissibly substituted
its own judgment for that of the
elected branches" by declaring
an insurance requirement can't
be imposed until people actually
seek medical care.
"Common sense, experience,
and economic analysis confirm
the testimony to Congress that a
'health insurance market could
never survive or even form if
people could buy their insurance
on the way to the hospital."'
Some states, including Alaska,
have cited Vinson's decision in
refusing to cooperate with the
health care law. But the judge
issued another ruling in March
ordering states to continue
implementing the law while the
case makes its way through the
courts.

Simply a scare tactic
FOIA shouldn't be abused for political motives
Arecent Freedom of Information Act request from the Mackinac
Center for Public Policy solicited e-mails regarding the union
isputeinWisconsinfromprofessorsatthreepublicuniversities
in Michigan. Filed last week, the non-profit, nonpartisan research
institute's request seeks faculty e-mails from the labor departments
at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne
State University that contain the words "Wisconsin," "Scott Walker"
or "Maddow." Though the state's sunshine laws technically give the
organization the right to ask for the messages, the universities involved
shouldn't feel pressured to release faculty e-mails. The Mackinac
Center's request is simply a scare tactic that aims to intimidate pro-
labor professors and suppress academic freedom.

Public enemy number one

This isn't the first time FOIA has been used
to intimidate and stifle criticism. On March
17, the Wisconsin Republican Party demand-
ed the release of e-mails from University of
Wisconsin-Madison Prof. William Cronon, an
open critic of Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott
Walker. Though the GOP claimed the request
was filed in order to determine whether or
not Cronon had violated a Wisconsin law that
stipulates state-funded resources - like work
e-mail - cannot be used for political purpos-
es, it's clear that Wisconsin's GOP was using
bureaucratic means to intimidate those who
oppose its actions.
Now the political witch-hunt has crossed
Michigan's borders. While the Mackinac Cen-
ter claims that the call for faculty e-mail is sim-
ply for apolitical analysis, the fact that the think
tank only solicited e-mails from the three uni-
versities' labor departments suggeststhere may
be more political motives behind the request. If
the organization wanted an unbiased analysis
of professors' responses to iheIabor protests
in Wisconsin, it could have requested informa-
tion from a number of other departments that
may address the dispute. Only requesting the
e-mails from the labor departments suggests
that the center aims to intimidate and suppress
the voice of one group - labor.

The FOIA request infringes on something
more important than e-mail privacy: academic
freedom. While it may not be appropriate for
university staff members to openly engage in
partisan politics, expressing judgments on the
actions of the government via personal e-mails
is well within their rights. Professors and stu-
dents alike should be able to question policy-
makers even if they're affiliated with a public
university.
The issue of whether certain staff members
violated policies by sending personal, political
e-mails fromtheiruniversitye-mail accounts is
the business of the universities, not the Macki-
nac Center. The think tank is trying to expose
which staff members at which universities are
pro-labor in order to present skewed informa-
tion about the political leanings of different
universities. The University of Michigan has
yet to respond to the FOIA request, and the
administration have a right to do what they can
to protect the privacy of their employees.
While the release of information under
FOIA is an important tool in making public
information public, sifting through the e-mails
of university staff members is an absurd mea-
sure. The Mackinac Center's request is sense-
less and an attempt to intimidate and stifle
dissenting opinions.

Michigan, it seems, has
become a dumping
ground for Wisconsin's
leftovers.
Just as Repub-
lican Gov. Rick
Snyder has fol-
lowed the lead
of Wisconsin's
Republican Gov.
Scott Walker
in scapegoat- NEILL
ing public sector MOHAMAD
employee unions
and gutting edu-
cation spend-
ing in order to pay for corporate tax
breaks, the Mackinac Center for Pub-
lic Policy- anon-partisan, non-profit
organization - has followed Wiscon-
sin's Republican Party in using spu-
rious Freedom of Information Act
requests to demand access to the
e-mail accounts of University faculty.
In Wisconsin, the Republicans'
bete noire is Bill Cronon, a prominent
professor of history at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison. On March
13, Cronon drafted an op-ed for The
New York Times that framed Walk-
er's assault on public sector unions
against the progressive tradition of
Wisconsin Republicans like former
Wisconsin Gov. Robert LaFollette.
In other words, he was practicing his
profession. On March 15, he started
a blog and wrote his first post about
the American Legislative Exchange
Council, a low-profile conservative
group which likely wrote Wiscon-
sin's anti-union legislation and then
handed it to Republican state legisla-
tors. And on March17, the Wisconsin
GOP demanded any e-mail Cronon
may have written from his univer-
sity'e-mail account that includes the
names of any prominent Wiscon-
sin conservatives. At the end of last
week, the Mackinac Center followed
suit by submitting FOIA requests for
any e-mail sentby various labor stud-
ies professors at Wayne State Univer-
sity, Michigan State University and

here at the University of Michigan
that includes the words "Wisconsin,"
"Scott Walker" and MSNBC host
"Rachel Maddow."
One thing is immediately clear:
There's no place in the entire world
where university professors have
more power and influence than in
conservatives' own minds. To critics,
academicfacultyaretheSupermenof
a new era - leaping tall buildings in a
single bound, and producing a new
generation of radical Marxists and
secretly preparing to ban apple pie
and put us all in prison camps where
we'll be forced to receive socialized
health care and Spanish lessons. As
a fellow social scientist in a related
field, this is an unending source of
comedy to me. Just last fall, I attend-
ed the annual meeting of the Ameri-
can Political Science Association,
where the unofficial, but still wildly
depressing, theme of the weekend
was whether political science could
ever make any contribution to our
daily lives. Other than, perhaps, the
economists, researchers in the other
social sciences rarely have the oppor-
tunity to use their expertise to guide
the public policy debates of the day.
Many ofus sometimes doubt whether
students remember anything about
our courses at all after final exams
are turned in.
And yet, here we are. He may be
our nation's preeminent authority
on early 20th century Midwestern
economic development, but up until
two ago, I wouldn't have recognized
Cronon if I ran him over with my car.
Now he's a bona fide public enemy,
with the Wisconsin GOP rummag-
ing through his digital trash, hunting
for an inevitably out-of-context quote
to pit'hindown as the new boogey-
man of a vast liberal conspiracy,
somewhere between Bill Ayers and
whoever first decided to start putting
fluoride in water.
It would be bad enough if Wiscon-
sin Republicans' fixation on Cronon,
or the copy-cat Mackinac Center,

simply reflected an unhealthy obses-
sion with the academy. But it's not
just that; it's a feint, and one more
step into a briar patch where billion-
aires like David and Charles Koch,
who helped bankroll Walker's elec-
tion in Wisconsin, are viewed with
equal suspicion as modest professors
like Cronon, or City University of
New York Prof. Frances Fox Piven,
who somehow found herself the tar-
get of death threats from Glenn Beck
viewers over a book she wrote in the
late 1960s. When no one is beyond
suspicion, everyone is a suspect, and
the most immediate consequence is
that the wealthiest and most pow-
erful political lobbies will be less
scrutinized than ever before. It's
most assuredly not an accident that
this development comes only a year
after Citizens United v. Federal Elec-
tion Commission, the Supreme Court
decision that effectively eliminated
even modest limits on campaign
spending.
GOP's fixation on
Cronon reflects
an obsession.
Speaking of political donations -
where does the Mackinac Center get
its support? Predictably, it's never
made any of its donor lists public. But
you can work out at least some of the
largest donors based on their own
income tax filings. The list includes
the heirs to Sam Walton's Wal-Mart
fortune, Amway founder gnd Michi-
gan Senate Republican candidate
Dick DeVos and - drumroll,'please
- Charles and David Koch.
But hey, at least we're cracking
down on this Bill Cronon loser.

Planned Parenthood should
lose its federalfunding
TO THE DAILY:
As members of the University of Michigan
Students for Life and counter demonstrators
at the March 26 Planned Parenthood rally
and Walk for Choice, we would like to elabo-
rate upon our reasons for attending.
One of the Planned Parenthood supporters
quoted in a Michigan Daily article (Planned
Parenthood supporters protest proposed slash
to funding, 03/28/2010) said abortion only
comprises 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's
services. However, this statistic is misleading.
Planned Parenthood performed 305,310
abortions in 2007, according to its 2008
annual report (contrast this with 4,912
referrals to outside adoption agencies). The
Kagen's blog was too hard on
First Lady's charitable acts
TO THE DAILY:
I'm disappointed that The Michigan Daily
chose to publish Kylie Kagen's ugly and
unnecessary attack on First Lady Michelle
Obama (Seeing Red: Give it a rest, Michelle,
3/29/2011). It is a tradition for the first lady
to have a charitable focus during her hus-
band's presidency. Both Laura and Barbara
Bush helped combat illiteracy. Nancy Reagan
started the "Just Say No" anti-drug cam-

average abortion costs between $400 and
$450. This means that Planned Parent-
hood's total income from abortions is at least
$122,124,000. The total health center income
is listed as $374,700,000 in the same annu-
al report. Therefore, abortion accounts for
about 30.6 percent of Planned Parenthood's
income.
We are not interested in taking away
health care services for women and children.
Rather, we want the public to be aware of
these facts in order to realize why defund-
ing Planned Parenthood is so crucial. There
are many truly non-profit organizations, like
our local ArborVitae Women's Center, which
deserve a greater degree of public support.

Anna Paone, LSA junior Elise Aikman, LSA
freshman Joseph Lipa and LSA sophomore
Carmen Allen on behalf of Students for Life.
paign. Lady Bird Johnson focused on beauti-
fying our highways. Yet I doubt Kagen would
be so quick to insult any of these women.
The sole reason people are so upset with
Michelle Obama's continuation of this tradi-
tion is because they disagree with her hus-
band. This serves no purpose other than
an attempt to slander Michelle Obama and
her husband. Kagen claims that the Obama
administration is run through propaganda,
but I think she needs to take a look in the
mirror.

Glover is continuing MLK's legacy

The internationally acclaimed actor Danny Glover is
coming to campus today at 4 p.m., and it's important
to understand the reason why. Our region has been
uplifted by a surge in Hollywood celebrity sightings
because of the film industry tax that may soon expire.
This visit, however, isn't motivated by quick eco-
nomic incentives. Beyond the Hollywood spotlight,
Glover has devoted countless hours to the cause of
social justice, garnering numerous awards for his
humanitarian efforts. Today, he will honor the unique
spirit of community building and creative organizing
emerging from Michigan, especially the grassroots
activist movements rising out of abandonment and
destruction in post-industrial Detroit.
Glover emphasizes these points in his foreword to
"The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activ-
ism for the Twenty-First Century", the new book by
Grace Lee Boggs that I helped to produce. "What does
it mean to develop the life-affirming relationship that
we must have not only for our own survival as a human
species but also for the survival of the planet itself?"
he challenges us to answer. "How do we bring out of
these ashes the ideas, the motivation and the spirit of
this particular moment and take it to the next step?"
Boggs is a 95-year-old philosopher and activist
with seven decades of community organizing expe-
rience, including the last 58 years in Detroit. Baits
Residence Hall has named a lounge after her, and she
received an honorary doctorate from the University in
2009. As University President Mary Sue Coleman then
remarked, "By nurturing Detroit as a city of Hope,
(Boggs has) brought optimism and inspiration to our
state and country."
Together, Glover and Boggs embody a vision of
humanism and global citizenship that carries on the
legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On this date in
1967, King gave one of the most important and cou-
rageous speeches in his life when he declared it was
"time to break silence" by denouncing the Vietnam

War. The urban rebellions of the 1960s had convinced
him that local and international pursuits of nonvio-
lence needed to be connected.
"A nation that continues year after year to spend
more money on military defense than on programs of
social uplift is approaching spiritual death," King pro-
claimed. What our society needed was a "revolution of
values" against the "giant triplets of racism, militarism
and materialism."
Exactly one year later, April 4, 1968, King was
assassinated.
We have all inherited King's unfinished agenda.
With American troops engaged all over the planet,
education systems in crisis and economic hardship
crippling household and government budgets, his pro-
phetic words ring as true today as they did 43 years
ago.
Because the problems we face often seem so over-
whelming, students often ask, "What can I do to make
a difference?" There is no easy answer.
We can start by taking the time to reflect on how we
came to this point as individuals, as a nation and as a
society. The next step is to educate ourselves about the
struggles for social change from the bottom up that
are already in motion in Detroit and places around the
world.
Today, we have a unique opportunity to learn from
Glover, Boggs and two award-winning scholars of Afri-
can American history, Robin D. G. Kelley and Gwendo-
lyn Midlo Hall. Professor Stephen Ward, who has played
a pivotal role in connecting students to Detroit, will
moderate this historic discussion, "Sustainable Activ-
ism for the 21st Century: A Forum in Honor of MLK."
Join them from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. this afternoon in the
Modern Languages Building Auditorium 3.
Scott Kurashige is director of the Asian/Pacific
Islander American Studies Program and associate
professor of American Culture and History.

Though the incident was
initially reported at midnight,
Brown said because the police
did not receive a confirmation
of the suspect's presence, did
not receive other calls report-
ing the incident and did not
have any reports of shots fired,
the alert was not immediately
sent out. The alert was sent at 1
a.m. when officers encountered
a few students in the Chemistry
Building.

Brown said police will return
to talk to the original person
who reported seeing the armed
man to see if they can find out
any more information. She said
police will also continue to
search the area.
While the emergency alert
was issued through text and
voice messages, a campus wide
e-mail about the incident failed
to activate, Brown said.
Brown said if an incident
like this happens in the future
students should take safe and
appropriate measures.
"If anyone sees anything sus-
picious always call the police
immediately," Brown said. "If
it's safe to do so get out of the

area, if it's not be sure to shelter
in place."
The last armed incident on
campus occurred on Jan. 18,
2011 when a DPS crime alert
was issued about a man who was
robbed at gunpoint at 3:30 a.m.
near Hill St. on the 700 block of
Oxford Rd.
The two male suspects in the
incident were arrested on Feb. 11
by the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment.
The last time an emergency
alert was issued was on March
3, 2011, when a severe weather
warning was in effect for south-
ern Michigan, with possible
tornados and 80 mile-per hour
winds.

attracts between 500 and 900
students at each event. But even
with a steady attendance rate,
Heilmeier said it is difficult to
gauge UMix's effect on student
drinking rates at the University.
" The night (students) do
choose to come to UMix, they
more often than not don't par-
ticipate in drinking because they
already have something going
on," Heilmeier said.
In addition to free movies
and karaoke, other activities
that have been offered at UMix
include billiards, video games,
roller-skating and making music
videos using a green screen.
The 2009 Student Life Survey,
conducted by the University's
Substance Abuse Research Cen-
ter and Addiction Research Cen-
ter, examined patterns of binge
M drinking and other alcohol and
drug habits among University
students. The study found that
there has been a statistically sig-
nificant drop in the percentage of
binge drinkers - 52.1 to 46.3 - at
the University between 2007 and
2009.
This continues a downward
progression in the number of
binge drinkers on campus from
a peak of 53.2 percent in 2005 to
46.3 percent in 2009. However,
Mary Jo Desprez, the alcohol and
other drug policy and preven-
tion administrator at University
Health Services, said until the
2011 survey has been completed,
itis impossible to tell if the recent
decreases can be classified as a
trend or as just a deviation in the
data.
Despite the percentage drop
in binge drinking from 2007 to
2009, more students have been
taken to the hospital for their
alcohol intake this year com-
pared to last year. This academic
year, 156 University students
have been transported to the
emergency room by authori-
ties for excessive intoxication,
Desprez said. Fifteen of the stu-
dents were repeat offenders, she
added. In comparison, Desprez
said 113 students were taken to
the hospital for excessive intoxi-
cation during the 2009-10 aca-
demic year.
According to the 2009-2010
executive summary of AlcoholE-
du for College surveys - admin-
istered to uncover drinking
tendencies of freshmen before
the academic year and again sev-
eral weeks into their first semes-
ter - drinking rates of University
of Michigan freshmen are simi-
lar to national averages.
Desprez said when freshmen
come to the University, there is
a range of drinking preferences.
These include non-drinkers who
intend to stay non-drinkers,
non-drinkers interested in try-
ing alcohol in college, students
who already drink a signifi-
cant amount and students who
have an alcohol addiction. The
University attempts to provide
resources and support for all stu-
dents, Desprez said.
"(The University's) respon-
sibility is to make sure we have
something for students wherever
they fall along that continuum,"
Desprez said.
Combating the alcohol cul-
ture among college students and

attracting them to non-alcoholic-

based events is something the
University has been working
toward and will continue to do,
Desprez said.
"Right now we don't really
have anything as powerful as
the beverage industry has in
their advertisements, and that
becomes really difficult," she
said. "Until we can really do well
with media literacy and really
pick apart those ads - that's sort
of what we're up against in terms
of how do I feel like I can connect
with someone."
The University's Office of Stu-
dent Conflict Resolution has also
seen a significant rise in the num-
ber of students going through
the center's Adaptable Conflict
Resolution for Alcohol and Other
Drugs Program. OSCR Director
Jay Wilgus said the program has
seen an increase from 112 stu-
dents last year to more than 300
so far this year.
"I'm not certain that (the
increase) is a result of increased
drinking," Wilgus said. "All fac-
tors indicate that it's a sign of
increased reporting from Ann
Arbor Police Department."
Because of improved com-
munication between AAPD and
OSCR, students who had previ-
ously received Minor in Posses-
sion citations but had not sought
help from OSCR are now being
referred there, Wilgus said.
According to the University's
Department of Public Safety
website, in 2009 there were
324 liquor law arrests or cita-
tions - defined as violating laws
including the transportation
and possession of alcohol - on
campus property and 655 refer-
rals to non-police programs like
OSCR for disciplinary actions.
For reports in 2007 and 2008, the
number of citations and referrals
were about 500.
Wilgus and Desprez said
the funding firm grants AAPD
received for enforcement this
fall has probably accounted for
part of the increase in the num-
ber of violations reported to their
offices.
Desprez noted that UMix's
sole purpose is not to combat
alcoholism on campus.
"(UMix's) goal is not neces-
sarily to do alcohol reduction,"
she said. "Their goal at the (Uni-
versity) Unions is to do a really
fun event in the Union on Friday
night, because when you do that,
people will come."
The AlcoholEdu for College
surveys indicated that students'
most important reasons for
drinking included having a good
time with friends, celebrating
and being outgoing in social situ-
ations. Desprez also said many
students drink to try to form con-
nections among peers.
Desprez said she believes
UMix provides a place for stu-
dents who don't drink or who
drink rarely to come and have
fun.
In attendance at UMix this
past Friday LSA sophomore
Katie Gauthier said she and her
friend, LSA freshman Elizabeth
Swindle, come to almost every
UMix event because the specific
activities offered, like the wax
hands students could make at
Friday's event, are a fun alterna-
tive to going out.
"We don't drink, and there's
not a lot to do on a Friday night

if we don't drink," Gauthier said.
Though UMix is a non-alco-

holic event - asnare all programs
administered by UUAP - even
students who have been drinking
are welcome to stop by and get
food before heading home, Heil-
meier said.
"We don't advertise it as a
non-alcoholic event because it's
not about the drinking," he said.
"The event is about students
coming together and having
fun."
Other events on campus,
however, are more explicit alter-
natives to drinking. Students
for Recovery, a campus organi-
zation established almost two
years ago, advocates sobriety
and lends support to students
recovering from drug and alco-
hol addiction.
"Our purpose is really just to
promote an overall wellness on
campus and to promote an alter-
native to the social culture here,"
Jennifer Cervi, a master's stu-
dent in the School of Social Work
and the group's president, said.
The organization, which is
supported entirely by donations,
hosts movie and game nights,
coffee crawls instead of bar
crawls and dances in collabora-
tion with the Michigan Electron-
ic Dance Music Association that
are open to all students, not just
those in recovery, Cervi said.
"We have 20 core members
that are in recovery, but we'll get
up to 200 people at our dance,
easy," she said.
The University's Residence
Halls Association also provides
alternative events on the week-
ends, according to Public Policy
sophomore DJ McKerr, RHA's
vice president for public rela-
tions.
In addition to RHA-spon-
sored events like Pre-Class Bash
and Siblings Weekend, RHA
works closely with each resi-
dence hall's multicultural and
hall councils to put on events
such as casino nights and ice
cream socials. McKerr said.the
events draw students who would
probably not attend parties as
well as those who would but
choose to go to the RHA events
instead.
Though Heilmeier said UMix
has a consistent attendance rate
and is considering bringing in
new activities like a live band to
attract more people, many stu-
dents say they never thought
about attending the event.
LSA senior Maria Galano said
she has never been to UMix and
found it unappealing because of
its association with the Univer-
sity.
"I just wasn't interested in
going and hanging out at, kind
of, a school function on a Friday
night," Galano said. "I spent my
whole week in school."
LSA senior Nick Caverly said
he hasn't attended the events
but said he doesn't feel there is a
stigma surrounding them.
"I don't think that it's socially
unacceptable," Caverly said. "I
just think (it isn't) something
thatmy friends and I ... ever
thought about going to, so we
never went."
Though she has never been to
UMix either, LSA senior Kristen
Krause said she thinks it is fun
for students who do attend.
"I know a lot of people that ...
go all the time, so for those that
like to be involved in that kind

of thing, more power to them,"
Krause said.

CONFERENCE
From Page 1A
author and environmental activ-
ist Derrick Jensen yesterday.
Saturday's open mic nightr
featured poetry and literature
readings as well as music per-
formances based on common
themes of the evening. Topics
covered during the event includ-
ed the suicide of a gay student at
Rutgers University in September,
the issue of bullying on college
campuses and the rights of gay
and lesbian students.
The first panel discussion
yesterday morning focused on
divestment from Israel, particu-
larly on college campuses. The
panel included Varilone as the
moderator, as well as Luis Sfeir-
Younis, a University lecturer of
sociology, Robbie Routenberg,
program manager of the Univer-
sity's Student Affairs Program,
and Barbara Harvey, a board
member of the Detroit chapter of
Jewish Voice for Peace.
The panel members discussed
the varying perspectives on

managing the University's rela-
tions with Israel, including total
divestment and dissociation
from the country, restriction of
certain business initiatives with
the nation or ignoring the issue
altogether and continuing busi-
ness relations with the country
- the University's current plan
of action.
Many people in the audience
spoke out during the discus-
sion, voicing opinions on foreign
affairs and the United States's
relations with Israel, as well
as discussing how a change in
the relationship could lead to
changed policy at the University.
The conference culminated
with a presentation and lec-
ture from Jensen, who spoke to
an audience of about 70 people
about a variety of social justice
issues. He began by describing
his research on environmen-
tal affairs and the steps he feels
people must take to formulate
more environmentally conscious
decisions and halt the growing
climate problem.
During his speech, Jen-
son quoted a part of his book

"Dreams" that highlights his
theory that people develop their
personal meaning of life, rather
than science or religion defining
it for them, and how this impacts
their environmental decisions.
"Science is the way to view
religion, and religion is the way
to view science," Jenson said.
Jensen concluded his speech
by detailing his support of legal-
izing medical marijuana in his
home state of California and
highlighted the economically
positive components of legalizing
the drugin more states across the
county.
LSA senior Gahl Liberzon said
he came to the event to raise his
voice and to learn more about
social issues on campus.
"I consider myself someone
committed to social justice and
social change, so I try to come to
events like these to try and get
myself more informed, to educate
myself," Liberzon said. "I think
that events like these are a good
place to do that. A lot of people
here are experts in their fields,
experts in organizing, coming
together, making a difference."


SPARK CEO
From Page 1A
Michael Finney, resigned from
his position at SPARK in Decem-
ber after Snyder nominated him
as the CEO of the Michigan Eco-
nomic Development Corporation
- a corporation that offers busi-
nesses economic development
services.
Since Finney's resignation,
Skip Simms, who was SPARK's
vice president of entrepreneurial
business development, has served
as interim CEO and president.
Simms will resume his position
as vice president when Krutko
starts at SPARK later this month.
Krutko said the University is
a key asset to the city's economic
atmosphere.

"The student body, the profes-
sors and the researchers at the
University of Michigan create a
very rich area for companies to
work to establish themselves and
to grow to global scale," Krutko
said.
While Krutko desires to bring
more high-tech companies to
Ann Arbor, local officials have
also advocated for more manu-
facturing and production compa-
nies in the area.
Ann Arbor City Council mem-
ber Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5)
said in an interview last month
that while Ann Arbor could ben-
efit from the presence of cutting-
edge companies, he would also
like to see more manufacturing
and production companies since
tley would provide more work-
ing class jobs.

Krutko acknowledged that
Ahn Arbor needs to diversify
its economy, but noted that the
products of technological com-
panies also create and safeguard
jobs in the manufacturing indus-
try.
"We need to have a balance of
companies that are creating the
next new thing that can be man-
ufactured or sold somewhere
else," Krutko said.
 1Aeadded that the city needs
to retain people with unique
skills and knowledge to make
Ann Arbor an appealing business
location.
"I think Ann Arbor and
SPARK have created a solid foun-
dation to be a strong competitor
... that is known for spinning out
innovative companies that grow
to global scale," Krutko said.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.con

ARMSTRONG
From Page 1A
Toy, who is the first gay man
to come out publicly in Michigan,
was also presented with an award
for his dedication to activism in
the LGBTQ community since the
1970s. Toy explained the begin-
ningofhis involvementin LGBTQ
rights, starting when he attended
a gay meeting at his Episcopal
parish in Detroit in 1970.
Before Armstrong approached
the stage, Toy called him a "men-
tor."
After walking on stage smiling,
Armstrong explained his initial
involvement in the LGBTQ com-
munity on campus, saying that
walking into the Spectrum Cen-

ter the day after his first football
game at the University was one of
the "scariest things" he had ever
done. But he said the support he
has received has been incredibly
positive.
"(The award) solidifies all
of the growth that I've gone
through, all the sort of experienc-
es and training that this school's
provided," Armstrong said in an
interview after the event.
Before the presentations, Riot
Youth - a group composed of
LGBTQ students and allies inAnn
Arbor and Washtenaw County
through the leadership program
at the Neutral Zone in Ann Arbor
- performed a theater piece
called "Gayrilla" and directed
by LSA junior Michael Sullivan.
In the performance, the group

voiced some of the struggles
LGBTQ high school students face
on a daily basis and used stories
based on a survey conducted in
Washtenaw County high schools.
"'Gayrilla' is really about mak-
ing schools a safer place fOr all
queer students," Sullivan said.
Thomas Zerafa, an LGBTQ
community activist in Michigan
who attended the event, said he
was happyto see the level of dedi-
cation for LGBTQ rights demon-
strated by Armstrong as well as
the Riot Youth performance.
"Chris is just so marvelous,
and he's kept his sanity through
everything he went through and
that's a sign of true leadership,"
Zerafa said.
Armstrong said he hopes his
experiences inspire other stu-

dents in the campus community
who are faced with struggles
regarding their sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity.
"I hope that (students) under-
stand that they can strive andsur-
vive despite some of the harsher
treatment," Armstrong said.
Shepard said in an interview
after the event that she was
happy to attend because of her
admiration for Toy and Arm-
strong.
"The weekend was amazing,
and honoring Chris was espe-
cially special because of all he's
gone through in the last several
months," Shepard said. "Every-
body needs to feel safe, or there's
no learning going on in any envi-
ronment. The University has to
make a commitment from the top

down to protect all their students,
and that takes education and a pri-
ority set by the administration."
Gabe Javier, assistant direc-
tor of the University's Spectrum
Center who also spoke at the
event, said in an interview after-
ward that though the event was
inspiring, it is only one step in the
process of changing the campus
climate for the LGBTQ commu-
nity.
"The real work is done when
you talk to people about what
you heard and saw tonight and
the impact you can make beyond
this," Javier said.
In an interview after the event,
LSA freshman Brian Collins said
he found Shepard's experience
very moving and inspiring for
further activism.

"Living in Ann Arbor, you get I
a lot of speakers and presenters,
and I have to say Judy Shepard
is one the most phenomenal
presenters that I've ever experi-
enced in my life, so I encourage
people to get active and to find
out for themselves and hear the
message that she has to give,"
Collins said.
LSA sophomore Charlotte
Keeler also stressed the impor-
tance of the event in influencing
the entire campus community,
not solely the individuals at the
event.
"I think most the people in
attendance tonight are probably
involved with the LGBT commu-
nity, but it's important for othef I
people to see that they can d
something," Keeler said.

A Caldecott Medal couple

It's over,
Steve Carell

G etting dumped sucks.
What sucks more is
getting dumped, giv-
ingit another cry, learningto
love once more and then getting
dumped
again. I
would know
- I was just
spurned for
the second
. time by
Steve Carell.
I bet he
doesn't even KAVI
remember SHEKHAR
the first PANDEY
time we
met. It was
the sweltering summer of 2002,
when I stayed up a wee bit late
one night and caught my first
episode of "The Daily Show."
Steve did one of his "Produce
Pete" sketches, something
about pineapples and Hawaii.
I don't recall exactly why, but
the sketch just killed me, and he
was so effortlessly charismatic
and wonderful. My dad lam-
basted me the next morning for
sleeping in so late, but I didn't
care - I had found Steve.
Months later, it was Steve
who helped me get through
the start of the war in Iraq - a
confusing, frustrating time for
a kid in middle school - with
"his spectacular deadpan as the
show's Senior War Correspon-
dent. By then, my parents had
finally accepted Steve, and I
didn't have to sneak around
to see him anymore. Sure, the
likes of fellow correspondents
Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry
and Ed Helms were strong
temptations, but I only ever had
eyes for Steve.
As 2004 started, Steve
became unexpectedly distant.
His appearances on "The Daily
Show" grew slim, appearing
maybe once a month on the
show. And then, one day, he just
left without any word or warn-
ing. My initial sadness arose
out of youthful bewilderment
- how could Steve have some-
thing better to do than making
me laugh on "The Daily Show?"
Sadness turned into rage
when I discovered he was head-
lining the American adaptation
of "The Office," which was to
begin airing in March 2005. I
had seen the first season of the
original British "Office" the
year before, and had become
infatuated with its sheer bril-
liance. Now these boorish,
"I-think-getting-hit-in-the-
balls-is-funny" American louts
would be remaking the show,
starring Steve "butt soup"
Carell? Despicable.
I did watch the premiere of
the American "Office," mostly
to affirm my belief that it was
going to be a steaming pile of
tutt. I could hardly contain my
maniacal glee when it turned
out I was right - the pilot was

a nearly shot-by-shot remake
of the first episode of the Brit-
ish version, except worse. The
American counterparts were
humorless schmucks, Geico-ad
rejects who were just happy
to quit their day jobs as bur-
rito builders at Chipotle. Steve
Carell, in particular, was exas-
perating, lookinglike Augustus
Gloop in Wonka's Factory as he
"upgraded" from Comedy Cen-
tral correspondent to broadcast
network sitcom star, yet falling
flat on his face in the shadow of
Ricky Gervais. Not only that,
his character was detestable -
a slimy, sexist blockhead who
had no business anchoring a
network show.
I ended up watchingthe
rest of the brief first season
of the American "Office,"
mostly because observing Steve
Carell's ineptitude felt like vin-
dication for him deserting me.
But then came the magnificence
of "The 40 Year Old Virgin," fol-
lowed by the highly improved
second season of "The Office,"
and I remembered why Steve
stole my heart in the first place
- his goofy abandon, blistering
charm and sublime smile.
The theme to
'The Office'
makes me cry.
I decided to give Steve a sec-
ond chance, and our renewed
relationship blossomed over the
next few years. Sure, there were
the subterranean lows (Prison
Mike from season three) but
the highs were soaring (Date
Mike from season six, Agent
Michael Scarn). Steve Carell's
' portrayal of Michael Scott
became infused with human-
ity - behind all the incompe-
tence, he was just a nice guy
who wanted everyone to like
him. Carell also developed a
now-legendary rapport with his
costars, who quickly evolved
from the cardboard-cutout
imitations they were in the first
season. By the end of season six
last May, watching Steve yuk it
up on "The Office" was one of
the highlights of my week.
Then came the Incident: June
2010, Steve Carell announced he
was leaving "The Office" after
its next season, quoted as saying
"I justthought it was time for
my characterto go" (celeb speak
for "I want mo' benjamins").
Oops, he did it again.
Now, television actors leave
shows all the time - it's the
nature of the medium. Michael
J. Fox left "Spin City" because
of Parkinson's, David Duchovny
left "The X-Files" because of
a contract dispute. But Steve

'Amos McGee'
brings prestige for
'U' alum and wife
By LUCY PERKINS
Daily Arts Writer
Early last January, 'U' alum
Phil Stead found out he was the
writer of a Caldecott award-win-
ning book, "A Sick Day for Amos
McGee." The Caldecott award is
annually given out by the Ameri-
can Library Association to an
artist for his or her work on a chil-
dren's picture book - in this case
Phil's wife, illustrator Erin Stead.
"It was bizarre," Stead said of
that fateful phone call from the
Association.
Stead first started sending his
ideas for picture books to pub-
lishers when he was at the Uni-
versity. As a full-time student and
an illustrator for Zingerman's,
he toyed with picture books as a
hobby.
A student in the School of Art
& Design, Stead took multiple cre-
ative writingclasses in LSA. But it
was a poetry class, taught by the
director of the creative writing
program, Keith Taylor, that influ-
enced Stead more than any other.
"When I was in college, I
wrote very serious poetry that

was deliberately dense and dif-
ficult to understand," Stead said.
"I thought I was Alan Ginsberg or
something."
Through poetry, Taylor taught
Stead the key to writing concisely
for children.
"While I was (in college), I was
just starting to learn how to craft
language," Stead said. "I didn't see
any connection between writing
poetry and writing for children."
But the two forms share a simi-
larity - in poetry and childrens'
books, the writer must choose
leach word carefully, using the
minimum amount of words pos-
sible to tell a story.
"You have to be a really great
wordsmith to be able to write
for kids, and you have to know
how to write succinctly," Stead
explained. "It's difficult, and
poetry can help you hone that."
After graduation, Stead and his
wife moved to Brooklyn. Stead
was working at a bookstore there
when a friend and colleague of
his had abook published by Roar-
ing Brook Press. His friend knew
Stead was a hopeful children's
book writer, and passed his name
along to his editor. Stead sub-
mitted a story idea that eventu-
ally turned into his first published
children's book, "Creamed Tuna
Fish and Peas on Toast."
After his editor discovered

that Stead's wife was an illustra-
tor, the editor asked to see Erin's
work. Impressed by her illustra-
tions, the Steads' editor requested
that the couple write and sketch
a story. So Stead sat down and
wrote something for his wife to
illustrate - the origin of "A Sick
Day for Amos McGee."
The book tells a story of an
elderly man named Amos, who
visits the zoo every day after
work. But when Amos gets sick,
the animals at the zoo visit him
instead.
"I decided that I'd write a story
based on what I thought (Erin
would) be good at illustrating,"
Stead said. "The first image that
came to me was Amos playing
chess with an elephant. That was
the first buildingblock."
The process involved constant
dialogue between the writer/
illustrator couple, but the final
product resulted in a Caldecott-
worthy creation.
Soon after "Amos" was selected
as a New York Times Best Illus-
trated Book, the couple began to
see the Caldecott as a possibility,
but doubted they would win. To
their surprise, on Jan. 10, they did.
"Erin's the youngest to win,
she's only 28," Stead said. "No
one's ever won for their first book,
it typically goes to someone who
has a lifetime of work behind

COURTESY OF ROARING BROOK
them."
The winner of the Caldecott
was announced publicly at noon
later that day, and in minutes both
Phil and Erin's phones were ring-
ing off the hook.
"Seriously, at 12:01 our phones
started ringing," Stead said. "We
got calls from every major and
minor newspaper. Meanwhile,
our publisher told us to get on a
plane to New York."
In June, the couple will travel
to New Orleans, where Erin will
be honored as the newest edition
to a long line of talented illus-
trators like David Wiesner and
Maurice Sendak. But the couple's
careers as individuals and col-
laborators won't stop here. Both
Steads have books that will be
coming out this summer, and they
have several more in the works.

"Wait a second ... this isn't the Polar Express?!"

Fun at the 'Source'

Gyllenhaal is eye
candy, 'Source
Code' is PB&J
By MACKENZIE METER
Daily Arts Writer
Sometimes things don't need
to be amazing to be good. There
are plenty of things that are
perfectly good
but also per- *
fectly generic.
Example: a Source Code
peanut butter
and jelly sand- At Quality16
wich. There's and Rave
nothing really
remarkable Summit
about it - in
fact, it's renowned for its ordi-
nariness. "Source Code" is like
a peanut butter and jelly sand-
wich. It's uncomplicated (except
for the plot) with just the right
amount of action and thrills to
balance out the lack of character
development.
When Air Force Captain Colter
Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal, "Love
and Other Drugs") awakes, he is
on a train. There is a woman he
has never seen before calling him

by a name he has never heard. In
his pocket is an ID that doesn't
belong to him and then, out of
nowhere, the train is engulfed in
a fiery inferno. Stevens is jerk-
ed back to a darkened capsule,
where it's explained to him by a
soldier named Colleen Goodwin
(Vera Farmiga, "Up in the Air")
that he is being sent back to relive
the last eight minutes before a
train explosion through the eyes
of a stranger in order to find
the bomber, and he will not be
allowed to rest until he succeeds.
The film is a little bit confused
about where it wants to go from
there. It could be a psychologi-
cal thriller, it could be an ethical
commentary, it could be a story
about true love and destiny - the
possibilities are endless. What
it is for sure is gripping. Audi-
ences will have a hard time tear-
ing their eyes from the screen
just in case they miss something
really amazing. The only thing
is - as gripping as the film man-
ages to be - that really amazing
something never comes. There's
no real pathos and it is difficult
to relate to the more or less card-
board-stiff characterization.
That being said, Jake Gyllen-
haal is in it. He's pretty easy on

the eyes, which makes certain
dull areas, like the constant rep-
etition, easier to stomach. Played
by Michelle Monaghan ("Due
Date"), his love interest Christina
is pretty bland as far ascharacters
go, but that's more of a reflection
on the script than on Monaghan's
actual performance. However,
Farmiga, the other female lead,
is a real scene-stealer. There's
something about her voice that
commands attention, and the way
she carries herself is transfixing.
Though entertaining to the
last minute, in trying to mimic
mind-freak thrillers, the film is
left with some weak spots. It's
not as complex or as smart as a
film like "Inception," but it tries
to be with its plot twists and
mind games. What results is a
somewhat confusing resolution
in which the film fails to address
some lingering questions about
the science and methodology
behind the strange experiment.
But, just as a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich is no Jimmy
John's Beach Club (with extra
avocado and no mayo), the film
is not incredibly groundbreaking
or very memorable. Just appreci-
ate it for what it is - simple and
great in the moment.

By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Arts Writer
"I'll be there for you, when
the rain starts to pour / I'll be
there for you, like I've been there
before."
Two sentences. Twenty-one
words. These song lyrics evoke
a very special time in my life -
time spent happily plopped in
front of the TV set watching my
six favorite friends. Each episode
may be a bit' different and the
characters' dilemmas may vary,
but when I hear that '90s one-hit
wonder band The Rembrandts
croon those timeless lyrics, I
know I'm back home.
OK, I'll admit I'm being cheesy
and romanticizing the whole
thing. But Itdo associate shows
with their theme songs andI
happen to believe the creators of
"Friends" found the perfect mel-
ody for their series.
I want to posit the notion that
the great shows, the ones we
remember for years, laugh about
and even cry about all have some-
thing in common: great music. To
see if my hypothesis holds true,
I think a look back upon some of
the finer past themes is in order.
(Note: These will be some of my
favorites. There are hundreds
of other shows with wonderful
musical accompaniment that will
not be mentioned.)
"Seinfeld." The juggernaut.
The "show about nothing." It
stays with us because of Jerry's
infamous raise of the eyebrows,
Kramer's legendary entrances
and, of course, the indelible
bassline that opens the show and
marks major transitions from
scene to scene. It so captures
the essence that is "Seinfeld" it
almost seems silly to attempt a
description here, but hey, we have
to set the bar somewhere.
As far as I'm concerned, this
is the epitome of what music can
achieve through the medium of
television: a level of interconnect-
edness with the series wherein
the music becomes another char-
acter within the show. Jonathan
Wolff's composition, supported
by background percussion tracks,
don't just enhance moments
between characters. They
respond and play along as though

Left to right: Barney, Robin, Lily ... wait .
the music itself were the invis-
ible fifth member of television's
"Fab Four." As "Seinfeld" fans
will surely attest, the only way to
move from a George rant to one
of Elaine's poignant observations
on life are a few good riffs of the
bass. It's simply how it's done.
Now, I've only covered sit-
coms. Let's not forget the serious
overtones that go with the finer
dramas of our time - remember
the brass orchestral tunes and
opening drums of the "Hawaii
Five-O" theme? I don't care if
you've never seen the show -
I definitely haven't, but I sure
know the theme song. It's a musi-
cal catchphrase for the 1970s.
And if you don't know it, I'll bet
your parents do. Care for some-
thing more timely? How about
"Woke Up This Morning" by
Alabama 3, the song that bumps
every time Tony Soprano makes
his way down the New Jersey
turnpike to his mansion in the
suburbs of North Jersey. Or the
pulsing synthesized rhythms of
the "Mad Men" opening credits,
which lend an aptly sinister qual-
ity to watching a silhouetted ad
executive fall from a Manhattan
skyscraper.
I could - and would love to -
go on and on and on. The point is
that, unlike film, television pro-
vides a sense of grounding and
solidarity that cannot be achieved
in a two-and-a-half-hour movie.
While there are unforgettable
film scores, by its nature, televi-
sion is more personal. We watch
it in the comfort of our living

rooms, on our laptops, with close
friends and family as opposed to
strangers in the theater.
Even when a show comes to
its inevitable conclusion and
specific plot points fade into the
recesses of TV history, the music
lives on. Just think - it's been a
while since Will Smith played a
kid from Philly transplanted to
Bel Air. Yet I'll wager that more
than a few of you out there can
still hum the tune to that opening
song.

A TV theme song, then, isn't
indicative of a few hours. It can
define years spent tracking and
growing with characters that
have graced the small screen.
An opening might be long or it
may be short. Sometimes there
are lyrics, and at times it's just a
few notes that permit us escape-
ment into a world where we feel
safe. The music reminds us of the
consistency inherent in a series,
letting us know we're back in
the same place with the same
people we know and care about.
To quote from one of the greats -
"Cheers" - "Sometimes you want
to go / Where everybody knows
your name / And they're always
glad you came."

'Belong' revisits teen anxiety

'Jane' anything but plain

By ARIELLE SPECINER
DailyArts Writer
The Pains of Being Pure at
Heart sounds like the title of a
depressing book about the hard-
ships of ado-
lescence - and ***C
that's not too
far from the the Pains Of
truth. Named Being Pure
after the
unpublished at Heart
children's story Belong
by lead singer
Kip Berman's Slumberland
friend, the
Brooklyn-based quartet brings
the high school drama sans
sophomore slump with its sec-
ond full-length album, Belong.
The Pains's latest brings
'80s dance rhythms and a more
poppy edge to its once extremely
to-fi, gritty sound. The band col-
laborated with mega-producer
Flood, who has worked with
groups like U2 and Nine Inch
Nails. The production has nota-
bly improved on tracks like "The
Body" where listeners can easily
pick up on the big, sparkly U2
production.
Belong begins with a punk
sound that transcends its way
into a scruffy vibe of whispered
vocals and the muffled guitars
that Pains fans are used to, with
an anthem-esque flare. It starts
off boldly and paves the way for

a dance party essence.
Though the album does
swing on the peppier side, it
has enough fuzzy reverb to star
in its own John Hughes movie.
Belong has the whole teenage
angst, rebel-chant thing going
on, but it's not whiney enough to
make listeners cringe. On track

This is arguably the larg-

with Jane running for her life

self nearly dead on the stoop of a
dreary house, where she will be
nursed back to health and reflect
on the events that brought her
there.
Though some fans of the novel
may be dismayed by the decision
to play with time and reduce
Jane's entire childhood to such
a short segment, it works well in
the context of the movie. Splin-
tering the past with the present
gives the viewer a much stron-
ger sense of how haunted Jane is
and makes the film far more real.
Looking drearily out the win-

The Pro You Don't Know
Evan King

By: Matt Rudnitsky // Daily Sports Writer
We all know Denard Robinson.
Just like we all know Mike Martin, Darius Morris, Tim
Hardaway Jr. and every other Michigan athlete with a
legitimate shot at becoming a successful pro athlete.
They look the part, don't blend in and can't even walk
through the Diag without turning a few nearby students
into the likes of 12-year old girls at a Justin Bieber concert.
But what most students don't realize is that there is a
guy on campus who already is a professional athlete - sort
of.
That guy is sophomore Evan King, No. 1 singles player
for the No. 22 Michigan men's tennis team.
A guy who has been virtually everywhere that matters
in tennis, from Michigan's own Varsity Tennis Center on
State Street all the way to the All-England Club in the
Wimbledon district of London, England.
But nobody in Ann Arbor seems to notice.
The funny thing is that before Evan King
became the Wolverines' top-ranked singles player, he was
in the spotlight.
Now? Not so much.
At a school dominated by football, hockey and basket-
ball, a tennis star isn't exactly hounded all day by star-
struck students, no matter how talented he is.
"I'll run into a couple people (on campus) who played
tournaments around the Midwest and ended up coming
here," King said. "They're like, 'Hey, I'm a tennis fan, I
know about you - you're a top recruit!' But it's extremely
rare."
But before college, King was featured on the cover of
RISE magazine (now ESPN RISE) and even served on a
committee supporting Chicago's 2016 Olympic bid.
"It was just a bunch of hometown people who would
have been the right age in 2016, in their prime, to be in the
Olympics." King said. "It was a great experience because
we got to speak in front of the Olympic committee, show
off our skills just a little bit, kind of demo stuff around.

"It was fun to meet a bunch of differ-
ent world-class athletes that were my
same age."
While King might downplay the
experience, it's pretty clear what it
meant.
At just 16 years old, the kid was
considered a future Olympian. But in
Ann Arbor, he's more anonymous than
the guys who produced the "The Pursuit of Jappiness"
video.
Standing at the hallowed grounds of Wim-
bledon, sliding across the fresh red clay of Roland Garros
and patrolling the most famous courts in our country at
Flushing Meadows would make any tennis player weak
in the knees. It just doesn't get any better.
But at 19 years old, Evan King has done it all.
King, who before college was No. 1 in the USTA
18-and-under rankings and No. 14 in the ITF rankings,
was at the forefront of junior tennis as a teen. That
means King was ranked above every junior tennis
player in the US and was ranked 14th internationally.
With that came opportunities most teenagers
could only dream of.
He got to play at the 2008 Junior Davis Cup -
tennis's version of the World Cup - in San Luis
Potosi, Mexico, where he went 8-0, leading the
United States to the title over Argentina.
He got to play at three of the junior Grand
Slams - Wimbledon, the French Open and
the US Open - sharing a locker room with the
game's biggest stars, marveling wide-eyed at
Rafael Nadal's gargantuan biceps and Roger
Federer's unmatched elegance.
He got to do just what Nadal, Federer and the
other professionals do every year - the only dif-

Krantz's homer lifted the Wol-
verines over Indiana in the first
game of a doubleheader in Ann
Arbor, and Michigan's momen-
tum spilled over into the night-
cap with a two-run first inning.
But soon enough, the mistakes
that have plagued the Wolverines

all season came back as quickly
as Krantz's homer left the park.
Michigan's seven errors this
weekend proved costly as the
Wolverines (1-2 Big Ten, 7-18
overall) dropped Friday's game
12-5 and won Saturday morning,
3-2, before an embarrassing 10-3
loss later in the day.
In Saturday's second game, it
was Indiana (2-1, 18-9) who was
on the wrong end of the defensive
miscues. A first-inning error led
to an RBI from freshman right-
fielder Michael O'Neil. Fifth-year
senior second baseman Anthony
Toth, who reached on the error,
later scored on a wild pitch to put
the Wolverines ahead, 2-0.
But sophomore hurler Kyle

"We had a game plan going
in ... and I didn't feel we exe-

Hutchins said. "I don't feel our
kids trusted it."
The third-ranked Wolverines
(3-1 Big Ten, 33-3 overall) faced
the Hoosiers in a double-header
on Saturday at Alumni Field
for their first home conference
matchup of the season. Michi-
gan won the opener, but lost the
second game in an extra-inning
battle to split the series.
The opening game remained
scoreless through three frames,

as both teams' mounds seemed
to have control. Senior pitcher
Jordan Taylor headed into the
bottom of the fourth inning with
seven strikeouts, and Indiana
pitcher Morgan Melloh, who
pitched both games, had already
struck out four Wolverines her-
self.
After starting off its season
on an offensive high, scoringhas
become an issue for Michigan.
In the beginning of the season,
during tournament play, the
Wolverines were averaging 8.1
runs per game, but since Big
Ten games started last weekend,
Michigan has cut that average in
half, scoring under 3.8 runs per
outing.
Melloh was not making this
issue any easier, as the All-
American pitcher transferred to
Indiana from Fresno State (the
Bulldogs had handed the Wol-
verines their most recent loss)
for her senior season to give
Michigan an ace to face.
"(Melloh's) one of the best,"

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins didn't think her team was unified in its loss.
Hutchins said. "She's one of the Wolverine to really capital-

CHAMPAIGN - As freshman
Sam Mikulak walked over to the
Michigan bench after Saturday's
Big Ten Championships, he had
his arms full.
He carried a third-place Tro-
phy for his vault routine, a tro-
phy for the Big Ten Freshman of
the Year and one for the Big Ten
Gymnast of the Year.
All of the awards were second
to the all-around title he won
on Friday - becoming the first
freshman to do so since 1994.
There have been three other
freshmen to ever achieve those
honors: Drew Durbin of Ohio
State in 1994, John Roethlisberg-
er from Minnesota in 1990 and
Harley Donner from Michigan
in 1975.
As Roethlisberger went on to
become a three-time Olympian
gymnast and Durbin a six-time
All-American, being compared
to those gymnasts categorizes
Mikulak as one of the elite.
"It feels amazing to know that
my name will forever be remem-
bered as one of the only fresh-
man to ever win gymnast of the
year," Mikulak said. "Words
can't describe how it feels."
On Friday, when Michigan
was trailing Illinois and needed
a clutch routine, Mikulak was
called on. He came through for
No. 6 Michigan by qualifying for
four of the six event finals and
also scoring a season high on the
rings.
"I don't think (Mikulak)
lets the competition rattle him
very much," Michigan coach
Kurt Golder said. "I think he's
a focused and calm competitor
and a good steady worker. He's
not the hardest worker I've ever
had, but he also has a lot of natu-
ral ability."
What may be one of the most
impressive aspects of the perfor-
mance is that on the floor exer-

cise - arguably his best event
- he suffered some miscues and
didn't make the event finals.
Although Mikulak didn't
notch an individual event title
on Saturday, his scores on every
event Friday night were one of
the top-four Wolverine scores.
This is something last year's Big
Ten Gymnast of the Year and
teammate senior Chris Cameron
wasn't able to do.
"(Sam) has got so much tal-
ent, and he isbuilt for this sport,"
senior Ian Makowske said on
Saturday. "Mentally he's solid as
a rock, and that's just a danger-
ous combo. This isjust thebegin-
ning of what he's going to do at
Michigan and beyond."
Even after making history, the
fact that Michigan didn't accom-
plish what it had set out to do was
more important than any indi-
vidual achievements.
"(Mikulak) is a great team-
mate," Makowske said. "It's not

often you find someone so tal-
ented who's also so modest. He's
just all around a really great guy,
and it's a privilege to have him on
this team."
As the Wolverines travel to
Columbus for the NCAA Cham-
pionships in two weeks, Mikulak
will look to cap off a success-
ful year in his debut season for
Michigan.
After placing second on the
vault at the Winter Cup Chal-
lenge in February, he has expe-
rience on the national stage. He
was also earned six medals at the
Junior Olympic National Cham-
pionships when he was a senior
in High School.
"I definitely want to place
in the all-around (at NCAA's),"
Mikulak said. "Personally, I

Michigan the 1-0 lead.
Two more strikeouts by Mel-
loh and two innings later, it was
Blanchard who was back at the
dish to lead off the bottom of the
sixth.
She impressed again, launch-
ing a solo home run off her first
pitch and over the right field
wall, putting Michigan up 2-0.
Indiana (2-2 Big Ten, 20-14
overall) capitalized in the top of
the seventh to put a tally on the
board, but Taylor worked her-
self out of a jam to earn her 17th
win of the season.
"I told them after the first
game that I was really happy we
got to see Melloh again - I knew
we would," Hutchins said. "And
to get up for the challenge."
But that was advice Michigan
didn't utilize.
During the second game,
Indiana knocked the Wolverines
back on their heels from the get
go.
Sophomore pitcher Stephanie
Speierman walked her first bat-
ter of the game, and after several

Clark was tagged for seven
runs - only one of which was
earned - in just 2.1 innings of
work.
Freshman designated hitter
and pitcher Alex Lakatos was
Michigan's lone bright spot,
going 3-for-4 in the game and
5-for-9 on the weekend, but it
wasn't enough to lift the Wol-
verines in the late game on Sat-
urday.
The game - which saw a
brief hailstorm blanket the
field - was moved to Saturday
afternoon because of predicted
inclement weather during the
scheduled Sunday start.
The early Saturday game was
a pitching duel, with redshirt
sophomore Bobby Brosnahan on
the mound for Michigan.
The lefty - who struggled
for much of the non-conference
schedule - finally found his
control, as he went 6.1 innings
and gave up just two earned
runs.
But when he was pulled in the
seventh with the Wolverines
trailing 2-1, it appeared Bros-
nahan's strong outing would go
for naught due to the stagnant
offense.
That all changed when
Krantz - starting for the
injured sophomore Derek Den-
nis at shortstop - came to the
plate with a runner on in the
seventh. Krantz crushed a 3-1
pitch high over the brick wall in

the lead right there, I thought
that sealed the deal right there,"
Krantz said of his homer. "It
gave us huge momentum and we
just worked off that."
Lakatos - who relieved Bros-
nahan in the seventh - was
the beneficiary of the go-ahead
score.
The righty pitched 2.2 score-
less, no-hit innings to lock up
his first career win - and the
team's first conference win, 3-2.
"That was one of the happiest
I've ever seen a Michigan base-
ball team since I've been here,"
Brosnahan said. "It was a big
win. They're a good team in the
Big Ten - they've got one of the
better lineups we'll face hitting-
wise ... So it's big to get a win
against these guys.
"Obviously we would've liked

Inthe opener Friday, the Wol-
verines were aided by another

But redshirt sophomore

Junior Coley Crank led the

three hits and an RBI.

With the opening week-
end of conference play in the
books, Michigan will take the
momentum of a win with it into
Wednesday's game at Central
Michigan before heading to
Purdue next weekend.
"We know we can beat any-
body," Krantz said. "In certain
times of the games, we've got to
make a play here and there and
we're right in it, like we did in
the first game (on Saturday). We
came up with a timely hit that
gave us the win, so we know we
can do it, we've just got to find
ways to do it more often."

-ference being the "junior" pre-
ceding all of the legendary tour-
nament names. And soon enough,
that word will disappear for him.
"It was awesome," King said. "It
was a little bit overwhelming at
first; you're in the same place, the
same locker rooms as all of the
famous players. You've got abadge;
you feel important and can go into
places where the normal popula-
tion can't really go.
"Every time, I see on TV - I
didn't playjunior Australian which
I kind of wish I could have done
- when like the French Open is
on, or Wimbledon is on, or the US
Open is on, they'll show an aerial
view of all the grounds and I'll be
like, 'Oh yeah, I was there.' Or, 'Oh
yeah, I played on that court.'
"Or, 'You remember that one
time I was eating crepes in Paris?"'
King has had some success at
the majors, too, most notably as
a 2009 doubles quarterfinalist at
Junior Wimbledon.
And in his favorite event - the
Junior US Open - King, playing
with his friend Denis Kudla, took
out the tournament's top seed in
2009 playing doubles. He also
pulled an upset of the No. 5 seed
in the singles, but in both draws,
fell in the following round. Then
in 2010, he took out the tourna-
ment's No. 6seed in the firstround,
cruised to a double-bagel, 6-0, 6-0
victory in the second round and
then finally lost to the No. 10 seed
Kudla, who took champion Jack
Sock to three-sets in the finals.
"Tennis has taken me to Brazil,
it has taken me to Europe," King
said. "It has taken me everywhere
in North America.
"I guess not many 18, 19 year-
old guys can really say that they've
been all around the world."
Guess not.
Evan King went to a
normal high school, once. He even
played in the Illinois State Cham-
pionships for tennis, winning eas-
ily as a sophomore.
"I think my closest match was
6-1, 6-3, or something like that,"
King said, casually downplaying
a feat most high-schoolers would
love to accomplish.
"(After winning state) I had
to really make the decision, was
(tennis) something I really, really
wanted to focus on and improve
on? I knew my development would
kind of stunt if I stayed at home. So
r that was a really, really big decision
the summer after my sophomore
year.
"I decided to go to Florida to
train at the USTA Training Acad-
emy, just for tennis basically, to try
and improve my game."
. Located in Boca Raton, Fla., the
USTA Training Center chooses a
select few of the nation's top junior
players and trains them full-time
- while providing them a Kaplan
online education - for the sole
purpose of molding them into pro-
fessional tennis players.
"It was basically all about ten-
nis down there," King said. "Their
goal down there is basically to pro-
duce a top-100 tennis player."
Florida was no walk in the park.
And it wasn't high school tennis. It
wasn't even college tennis. It was
tougher.

Playing with the country's
brightest young stars - the class
included some current pros and
No. 19-ranked Ohio State sopho-
more Chase Buchanan - King
went through a grueling daily
schedule for two years. Buchanan
ended the recruiting process as the
No.1 prospect in the 2009 class.
"So, pretty strict schedule day-

to-day," King said, describing his
daily routine. "Just wake up - it
was online schooling, so you'd
have like two hours ofcstudy hall in
the morning - then you had ten-
nis, then you had fitness, then you
had lunch.
"Then you had another two
hours of school, and then, ten-
nis, fitness, lunch, and just repeat,
Monday through Friday. And then
Saturday morning, that again, and
then you kind of got Sunday off."
So when he made the transition
to college athletics - something
that normally involves a lot of
sweat and pain mixed with vomit
for a freshman - King was rela-
tively unfazed.
"There was more tennis in
Florida because the school sched-
ule was a ton more flexible," King
said. "Everything was online so it
was basically at your own discre-
tion to do the work. So instead of
playing once a day for three hours
like we do here, we played twice a
day there for four hours. But con-
ditioning and weight lifting was
pretty similar-type stuff.
"It was a pretty smooth transi-
tion from Florida to Michigan, I
think, for me."
Try telling that to your average
college freshman, athlete or not.
Fortunately for King, the
money involved in NCAA tennis
pales in comparison to football -
tennis players don't have to deal
with Reggie Bush or Cam Newton-
like temptations.
Still, he was in their league as a
recruit. And he got his fair share of
attention.
"I really enjoyed (the recruit-
ing process) because every match
I played during the summer of
my junior year and the fall of my
senior year, there were tons of col-
lege coaches watching every single
match I played," Kingsaid.
"You get calls and they discuss
their programs - what they can
give to you and what you can gain,
stuff like that. I mean, I really, real-
ly enjoyed the process."
King ranked as high as the
nation's No. 2 prospect by Ten-
nisrecruiting.net and No. 1 in the
TennisRPI rankings - the same
system used by the NCAA Tour-
nament Selection Committee in
basketball.
He won the 18-and-under sin-
gles title at the 2009 Easter Bowl
ITF Championships in Rancho
Mirage, Calif. - one of the most
prestigious tournaments in junior
tennis - and the 2008 USTA
National Clay Courts title, as a
16-year old playing in the 18-and-
under division.
But that only scratches the sur-
face of King's junior success.
With a chance to go to nearly
any college he wanted to, King
faced a tough choice. Growing up
in Chicago and watching North-
western tennis, he had an affinity
for the Big Ten.
So he didn't struggle much in
narrowing down his choices to
Michigan, Ohio State and Illinois.
But choosing Michigan wasn't
exactly a no-brainer. Ohio State
and Illinois are Big Ten and
national powerhouses. As a com-
petitive kid, it's tough to pass that
up. But King did it anyway.
Citing the balance between the
styles of Michigan's head coach,
Bruce Berque and its assistant
coach, Sean Maymi - not to men-

tion their vast knowledge of the
game and stellar reputations -
King chose to go blue.
"And out of the three, academi-
cally, I mean, if it was close, then
(Michigan) is so much better,"
King said, smiling.
Now that's a Michigan man.
King's freshman year

was solid, but unspectacular.
Playing mostly No. 2 singles -
with a few matches at No. 1 - he
went 21-13 in singles as a fresh-
man, with a 14-9 record in dual-
matches.
That was good enough to earn
him All-Big Ten Honors and tobe
named Big Ten Freshman of the
Year. But it didn't make a huge
splash on the national stage.
On the other hand, as a sopho-
more, King is winning at a rate that
would make Charlie Sheen jealous.
Prior to losing on Saturday, he
had won 12 matches ina row at No.
1 singles. And nearly all of them
came against ranked opponents,
including a straight-sets win over
No. 6 Reid Carleton of Duke.
The Wolverines have faced
eight top-25 teams in their first
seventeen dual-matches, but King
has emerged nearly unscathed,
going15-2 while facing each team's
top dog.
He's gone from being (laugh-
ably) unranked to start the season,
toNo.21nationally.And ifhekeeps
up his current pace, that ranking
will keep climbing. Fast.
"Individually, I'd love to win
(individual) NCAA's," King said.
"That's an extremely tough task;
there are a ton of really solid play-
ers in college.
"But that's my ultimate college
goal: to win NCAA's."
Trailing No. 45 Wake For-
est senior Jonathan Wolff 5-0 on
Saturday, Feb. 5, King demon-
strated what sets him apart from
the average racket-slamming,
profanity-howling player. Peering
at his perennially-calm demeanor,
you'd never know if he was trail-
ing the No. 45 player in the nation

of No. 6 Carleton or casually beat-
ing one of his buddies in a game of
ping-pong, as he so enjoys.

of frustration.
You won't see him sulk. And you
won't see him choke.
"The mental component is so
big because once you get to a cer-
tain level in tennis, everybody can
pretty much hit every shot," King
said. "So it's basically what you do
with what shot, when you decide
to make a decision, how cool you
are under pressure."
King's balance of enthusiasm,
relaxation and ferocity is a sight to
behold, one that engages the crowd
and lifts his intensity, but some-
how, keeps him calm.
"I'm a really, really relaxed indi-
vidual," explained King, leaning
back in his chair, with his trade-
mark sincere, serene, focused look
pinned to his face.
You just can't faze him.
King won't buckle
under pressure.
But for any future opponents, all
hope isn't lost. There is something
that makes King's cool crack.
"(My serve speed) is like a sore
subject with me," King said, grit-
ting his teeth, reluctantly continu-
ing. "I played US Open juniors this
year and we had radar guns and all
that really cool stuff, and I couldn't
break 120. I got 119.I cannot break
120.
"I was really embarrassed about
that, butI got 119.I didn't purpose-
ly go like, 'Boom,' see how hard
I could actually hit it, but in the
course of the match, I didn't break
120. I always thought that I could
crank it up a little bit higher than
that, butI don'tknow.
"I wish we had radar guns here,
so I could see that, but 119 I guess
is officially the fastest I've served.
But Im pretty sure I can get higher
than that, so next time I'm in that
kind of situation I'm just gonna go
crank one as fast as I possibly can
just to know."

cally model their game off of a pro,
but I try to play like that."
King had a choice.
There's no "one-and-done" rule in
tennis.
He could be a pro, right now.
Successful pro tennis players,
especially Americans, who took
the college route are a steadily
growing trend - like James
Blake, John Isner and Bob and
Mike Bryan - but they're still the
minority..
Stars like Andre Agassi, who,
per CNN, was once a two year-old
prodigy "running around with
a racket taped to his hand and
sleeping with a tennis ball over his
head," turned pro as early as 16,
putting guys like King behind the
eight ball while pursuing higher
education.
. But King stands by his choice to
go to college.
"I think for each individual it's
different because most pro ten-
nis players really don't reach their
success until they're like 22, 23,
24 years old," King said. "So that
means if a guy turns pro at 17,
that's a good five or six years that
they're struggling week in, week
out, playingfutures and challenger
level tournaments, with a ranking
somewhere around the 600s, trav-
eling week-to-week'to different
countries.
"And I mean, for me, I'd rather
be in a stable environment; I know
my game is improving here. But
for other people, they'd rather be
out there playing tournaments and
traveling the world. I couldn't real-
ly deal with playing a tournament
20 weeks out of the year and if
you have a good year you win one,
maybe two of those tournaments
when you're my age."
What if he had taken
the other path?

Two of King's best friends,
Denis Kudla and Jordan Cox,
skipped college and went straight
to the pros. It hasn't worked out
badly for them, either. Kudla
already owns a Futures tourna-
mentsingles title and is ranked No.
462 in the world. Cox is ranked No.
449.
"I think for me it's the right
choice," King said. "But (Kudla
and Cox) are pro right now floating
around the 500 (ranking) range,
and that was the right choice for
them. But this was definitely the
right choice for me."
Still, it makes you wonder
where King would be right now if
he hadn't gone to Michigan.
"(Kudla and Cox) are the same
age (as me). We traveled to Europe
in juniors together, played the
junior grand slams, we were dou-
bles partners, and we're all the
same level. So for me, it's kind of
interesting to see who will be the
most successful. It's kind of like
a little friendly rivalry, which is
cool."
We're all the same level.
Let that sink in. King - just
a 19-year old sophomore - is on
the same level as two guys ranked
above allbut about 450 guys in the
entire world.
And if you want to talk strict-
ly in terms of our country,- as
Americans often love to do - Cox
is the 29th-ranked American while
Kudla is 30th.
Just think about it. Say all goes
according to plan and Denard Rob-
inson is picked near the end of the
first round of the NFL Draft in a
couple of years. That would mean
he's one of the best 32 players in the
country in that year's draft, one of
about 1,700 players in the NFL.
But King might just be as good
as all but 30 people in the country,
of any age. Right now.
So you should probably get to
know his name.
It's Evan King.

using the crowd and enjoying it
and was just having a good time
out there."
Most tennis players aren't "hav-
ing a good time" trailinglS-0 in the
first set of a big match.
Still, after whipping a fore-
hand passing shot worthy of the
highlight reel on a dead sprint
that bear-hugged the line, King
didn't hesitate to let out a Nadal-
esque "Come on!" that ignited
the record-setting crowd, forcing
them to gather their sunken jaws
off the Varsity Tennis Center's car-
peted floor.
Moments like that aren't out of
the ordinary for King, who con-
stantly pumps himself (and his
teammates) up with booming "Go
Blue" and "Here we go Michigan"
cries that can probably be heard in
his native city of Chicago.
You can hear King yell. You can
hear him cheer. And it's loud.
But his yells will always be
encouraging. They won't come out

Just because King
chose to stay away from the grind
of the pro tour for a few years
doesn't mean he won't get there.
King knows that the old-school
notion of college tennis being a
hindrance to development is a
bunch of Oscar Meyer's finest
bologna, and he's determined to
make tennis his career.
"I just want to be the best I
possibly can, and hopefully that
means traveling the world play-
ing ATP-level stuff, so that would
mean I'm probably a top-50 or 60
player, something like that.
"(My goal is) just traveling the
world, making money, playing ten-
nis. That would be unbelievable."
Still, the adjustment from the
college game to the pros is a big
one. King realizes that in college,
he won't play anybody older than
23 years, even in the most extreme
case. But he could be playing a
futures tournament this summer,
matched up against a 29-year old
veteran who oozes experience and
savvy.
"I'm not saying the level is any
better (in the pros) because there
are a ton of great guys in college,
but I guess the pro guys have more
experience," Kingsaid.
"And I know that everything (in
my game) can improve. I'd love to
have a bomb serve by the time I get
out of here."
While King's a great athlete
with top-end speed, his game is
nothing like Rafael Nadal's - even
if both are lefties and have stellar
baseline forehands.
"I guess I kind of aspire to be a
player like (ATP No. 9 Fernando)
Verdasco," King said. "Pretty big
forehand, solid off both sides,
spends most of his time on the
baseline, but can come in (to net).
"I've got a long way to go to get
to that level, but I try to model
myself as that type of player. I
don't think anyone can realisti-

Robinson makes impression,

Signal caller finding
success against
Mattison's defense
this spring
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
It didn't take long for Denard
Robinson to make Greg Matti-
son eat his words.
Michigan's star quarterback
and defensive coordinator had
been exchanging friendly jabs
before spring practice started
- and Robinson has served his
coach a large piece of humble
pie.
"I've had to be really humble
around him lately," Mattison
said. "Now, the other guy I've
really started to get on, so he's
been getting hit a couple of
times. So I can get on him a little
bit."
While Mattison turns his
mockery to Devin Gardner, one
would assume, Robinson has
dazzled his new coaches with
his speed and athleticism.
"If the darn kid would throw
the ball, rather than run all
the time - I mean, anybody
can scramble," Mattison said,
tongue in cheek.
"No, I'll tell you one thing, if
you're calling defenses against
him - I said it after one of our
days - we rushed four, played
regular coverage and you're
asking for trouble," Mattison
added. "When he drops back
and you're not perfect in your
lanes, it's going to be a first
down. Because he beats some-
body and he's going to beat you
inside or outside - I didn't real-
ize how fast he was.
"I mean, there's guys that
have perfect angles, and all of
a sudden I look and they're past
the stakes. He really is some-
thing."

sive Wolverine offense' will try
to avoid a slump in 2011.
His left tackle, Taylor Lewan,
summed it up perfectly in an
interview with MGoBlue.com
on Friday.
"No one has any doubts,

Lewan said. "That's probably the

Interestingly enough, Robin-

whom he has stayed in contact,
said Robinson's ultimate goal is
to play in the NFL - playing in

playing quarterback at the next

ESPN's NFL Draft Analyst

ing the NFL Scouting Combine
that he didn't think Robinson
would play quarterback in the

could change that notion. For
now, Robinson is working with
his receivers to settle into an
offense that requires him to
drop back and spray passes all
over the field.
"We come in every day ready

And though Mattison may be

"It's kind of funny," Robin-

verines' doubleheader, the Indiana
softball team stood in the outfield
to take pictures of the Alumni Field
scoreboard, capturing the monu-
mental upset on camera phones.
The Hoosiers didn't get there
withoutcontroversyor acomeback
from the Wolverines, who eventu-
ally fell to the Hoosiers, 5-4, in a
bizarre game.
The strange happenings began
early in game two, when play was
stopped for a few minutes as ahail-
storm fell at the Wilpon Complex.
Within seconds, the playing field
was covered with white pellets,
and although the game eventually
resumed and the sun returned to
the sky, the abnormal occurrences
didn't cease. In the sixth inning,
the umpires, players, coaches and
the 1,271 fans in attendance were
left looking for answers.
A Michigan grounder was
ripped up the middle for a base
hit, but Indiana shortstop Brean-
na Saucedo and Michigan senior
Alycia Ryan became entangled
while both acting in their best
interests.
According to the rulebook, if
both players are indeed acting in
their own best interests, no inter-
ference call shall be made. The
Hoosier fielder was attempting to
prevent the base knock, while Ryan
was simply advancing to third.
The umpire initially ruled that
there was no interference on the
play by Ryan, and she was awarded
third base. But after hearing from
Indiana coach Michelle Gard-

ner - a former Wolverine softball
player under Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins - the umpires conferred,
eventually ruling that Ryan had
impeded the Indiana fielder's
attempt to make a play. She was
subsequently called out.
Then, it was Hutchins' turn to
put in her two cents. After a heated
discussion with the head umpire,
she was ejected from the game.
"I felt that there was no play
on the ball," Hutchins said. "But,
clearly, I don't get to make the call."
Hutchins and Ryan agreed that
Ryan was simply trying to advance
on the play.
"I'm not exactly sure of the rule
on that, but I was just going to
third," Ryan said.
Nevertheless, the ruling killed
a Michigan rally. Senior Jordan
Taylor came in to relieve starter
Stephanie Speierman. But Taylor
was not her normal All-American
self - a rarity that Hutchins said
her team must be ready for.

"Taylor has done her part for
us," Hutchins said. "We can't make
her do everything."
Taylor surrendered a tower-
ing two-run home run in the fifth
inning, allowing the Hoosiers
to regain a 4-2 lead. The score
remained that way until the Wol-
verine half of the sixth when
Michigan (3-1 Big Ten, 33-3 over-
all) knotted the score by way of a
two-out rally.
The teams needed extra frames
to conclude the nightcap, and Hoo-
sier Sara Olson took Taylor deep
in the top of the eighth for the sec-
ond time. The homer turned out to
be the crushing blow from which
Michigan would not recover.
"(Taylor) needs some help,"
Hutchins said. "She needs some
support because she's not always
going to be at her best.
"You look through our lineup
and you look through our RBI col-
umn, and we need some people to
pick it up."

He has gone hitless in his last 26

His streak was temporar-
ily snapped in the first inning
of the second game on Saturday
when he appeared to pick up an
infield single. The ruling was
later changedto a throwing error,
though, and the slide continued.
"Anthony will come around

Maloney said. "He wants it so
bad, and sometimes, when you
want it so badly, it can actually be
a hindrance because this game is
so mental.
"And he's really a good hitter.
The irony of the whole thing is,
he's putting so much pressure on
himself, he wants to do so well.
And sooner or later, he's just
going to have to let it go. And it's
hard to do."
DENNIS GOES DOWN: Sopho-

injured his foot in last weekend's
series against Michigan State
and has been wearing a boot ever
since.
Though he didn't leave the
game, he suffered a fracture and
will be out three more weeks.
Krantz, the hero'of Saturday's
first game, took over the short-
stop duties in the Indiana series.
Maloney said he might experi-
ment with moving Krantz to
second base and Toth to short-
stop. Toth played the shortstop
position earlier in his career but
moved to second base to make
room for Dennis last season.
