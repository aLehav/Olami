UNIVERSITY SPONSORSHIPS
: Adidas
mishandled
severance

Coleman writes
letter encouraging
company to pay fired
workers
By ADAM RUBENFIRE and
PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor and
DailyStafReporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman expressed concern
over the treatment of terminated
employees at a former Adidas con-
tractor in Indonesia ina letter sent
to two Adidas America, Inc. execu-
tives on Sept.21.
At the heart of the issue is the
ongoing treatment of the former
employees of P.T. Kizone, one of
Adidas' former suppliers. The
Indonesia-based company closed
in April 2011 when its owner fled
the country after the company's
sudden bankruptcy.
More than 2,700 workers never

received compensation from the
company. Nike and one of its sup-
pliers contributed $1.5 million
to the severance payments for
employees, but Adidashas not con-
tributed directly to the fund. Still,
Adidas says it has offered food
vouchers and job placement ser-
vices to the former employees.
The University's eight-year
partnership with Adidas began
in 2007 after its deal with Nike
expired, and is set to provide the
University with $60 million over
the life of the agreement. Though
Coleman did not directly threaten
to sever ties between the company
and the University in the Sept. 21
letter, she did request that Adidas
provide assistance and reparations
to the former employees of the P.T.
Kizone factory and also submit
monthly reports to the University
about the progress of arbitration
over the issue.
"I hope that Adidas will fully
appreciate the importance the

the violence that has killed hun-
dreds in the country's north.
In a video uploaded Sunday to
YouTube, Abubakar Shekau also
denied claims that the spokes-
man for the sect known as Boko
Haram had been killed by Nige-
ria's military. He said the group
would continue to "follow our
religion" and carry out attacks in
Nigeria's predominantly Muslim
north.
The Associated Press could
not immediately authenticate the
video Monday, but it appeared
to be from the sect and followed
the pattern of other videos previ-

TEHRAN,
Rare labor petition
in Iran shows

For weeks, a manifesto com-

economy circulated in secret
among factories and workshops.
Organizers asked for signatures
and the pages began to fill up.
In the end, some 10,000 names
were attached to the, petition

in one of the most wide-reaching
public outcries over the state of
the country's economy, which has
received a double pounding from
tightening Western sanctions and
alleged mismanagement by Presi-
dent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's
S government.
The rare protest document -
described to The Associated Press
this week by labor activists and
others - suggests growing anxi-
ety among Iran's vast and poten-
tially powerful working class as
the ruling system struggles with
the latest sanctions, which have
targeted critical oil exports and
blackballed Iran from integna-
tional bankingnetworks.

Taliban suicide bomber kills 14

At least three

60 civilians hurt
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP).
- A Taliban, suicide bomber
rammed a motorcycle packed
with explosives into a joint U.S.-
Afghan patrol on Monday, kill-
ing 14 people including three
Americans in the latest attack on
an increasingly fraught program
to help Afghan forces take over
security so foreign troops can
withdraw from the country over
the next two years. -
The attack followed more
American casualties over the
weekend that pushed the U.S.
military's death toll for the
11-year-war above 2,000 - a fig-
ure that has climbed steadily in
recent months as attacks on the
so-called "partnering" initia-
tive have risen.
Joint patrols between NATO
and Afghan forces, like the
one targeted Monday, have
been limited following a tide of
attacks by Afghan soldiers and
police on their international
allies. Last month, the U.S.
military issued new orders that
require units to get approval
from superiors before conduct-
ing operations with Afghans.
Two weeks later, U.S. officials
said most missions were being
conducted with Afghans again,
though the system of approvals
remained in place.
The close contact - coalition
forces working side by side with
Afghan troops as advisers, men-

tors and trainers - is a key part
of the U.S. strategy for putting
the Afghans in the lead as it and
other nations prepare to pull out
their last combat troops by the
end of 2014.
But the rising death toll for
international troops has raised
troubling questions about
whether they will achieve their
aim, boosting calls inside the
alliance for a pullout as soon as
possible and jeopardizing the
goal of training the Afghans to
fully secure their country.
In the latest attack, the
bomber struck the mixed police
and military patrol shortly after
they got out of their vehicles to
walk through a market area in
the eastern city of Khost. It was
a reminder that the insurgency
is still fighting hard after 11
years of a U.S.-led war to defeat
the militants.
In addition to three Ameri-
cans and their translator, six
civilians and four police officers
were killed in the explosion,
provincial government spokes-
man Baryalai Wakman said.
The police officers were part
of a specialized quick-reaction
force, he added.
Blood could be seen on the
market road as Afghan police
and soldiers tried to clean up
the area after the blast. Slippers
and bicycle parts were strewn
about.
"I heard the explosion and
came right to this area. I saw
the dead bodies of policemen
and of civilians right here," said
policeman Hashmat Khan, who
ran to the site of the blast from
his job as security for a nearby
bank.

Coalition spokesman Maj.
Adam Wojack would only con-
firm that three NATO service
members and their translator
died in a bombing in the coun-
try's east, without giving an
exact location or the nationali-
ties of the dead.
The international military
alliance usually waits for indi
vidual nations to announce
details on deaths. Most of the
troops in the east and in Khost
province are American. The
translator was an Afghan citi-
zen, Wojack said.
More than 60 Afghan civil-
ians were also wounded in the
bombing, the governor's office
said in a statement. The city's
hospital alone was treating
about 30 people injured in the
explosion, said Dr. Amir Pacha,
a physician working there. He
added there could be other vic-
tims being treated at nearby pri-
vate clinics.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah
Mujahid said in text messages to
media that the insurgent group
was behind the attack.
The weekend firefight that
led to the 2,000th U.S. death
occurred in a gunfight between
Afghan and U.S. forces,
although, both sides have con-
flicting accounts. It may have
been sparked by a disagree-
ment between the troops, or
confusion over the source of an
insurgent mortar or grenade,
according to various Afghan
and international officials.
So far this year, more than
50 U.S. forces have been killed
in insider attacks by Afghan
troops or insurgents who have
infiltrated their ranks.

Syria rails against
rebel supporters at
United Nations
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Syria's foreign minister brought
his regime's case before the
world Monday, accusing the
U.S. and its allies of promot-
ing "terrorism" and blaming
everyone from neighbors and
extremists to the media for
escalating the war - except the
Syrian government.
Addressingministers and
diplomats from the United
Nation's 193 member states as
fighting spread in the historic
Old City- of Aleppo, Foreign
Minister Walid al-Moallem
lashed out at calls in Wash-
ington and in Arab and Euro-
pean capitals for Assad to step
down as interference in Syria's
domestic affairs.
Al-Moallem blamed inter-
national organizations for
prolonging the crisis and
denounced countries such as
the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar
and Turkey for supporting the
opposition's "terrorism."
"This terrorism which is
externally supported is accom-
panied by unprecedented media
provocation based on igniting
religious extremism sponsored
by well-known states in the
region," he told the U.N. Gen-
eral Assembly.
Members of the opposition
said it was common knowl-
edge that these neighboring
Arab countries were support-
ing and financing the rebels,
but said the Assad government
had brought it upon itself after
cracking down on protests that
began peacefully 18 months
ago.
"It is the regime's mindless,
brutal and criminal, military
crackdown that pushed the
Syrian people to ask for help
from the international com-
munity, from NATO and from
the devil himself if necessary
to protect them," Haitham
Manna, a Paris-based veteran
Syrian dissident who heads the
external branch of the National
Coordination Body opposition
group, told 'The Associated
Press.
Al-Moallem's speech fol-
lowed his meeting with Secre-
tary-General Ban Ki-moon in
which the U.N. chief "raised

in the strongest terms the
continued killings, massive
destruction, human rights
abuses, and aerial and artillery
attacks committed by the gov-
ernment," according to a state-
ment by his press office. "He
stressed that it was the Syrian
people who were being killed
every day, and appealed to the
Government of Syria to show
compassion to its own people."
The Syrian foreign minister
in his address invited the oppo-
sition to "work together to stop
the shedding of Syrian blood"
and said that a Syrian-led dia-
logue could produce a, "more
pluralistic and democratic"
country.
The opposition called the
speech a classic case of regime
"propaganda," and 'dismissed
his calls for dialogue as not
genuine.
"While the brutal and delu-
sional Syrian regime con-
tinues to pay lip service to
diplomacy, its actions over the
past 18 months have demon-
strated beyond any doubt that
they have no interest in mean-
ingful reform or " dialogue"
Radwan Ziadeh, a U.S-based
spokesman for the chief opposi-
tion group, the Syrian National
Council, said in a statement.
Al-Moallem argued in his
address that his regime is con-
fronting a myriad of conspira-
cies by internal and external
forces determined to end the
Assad family's 40-year rule.
But al-Moallem made clear
that Baslhar Assad has no inten-
tion of relinquishing the presi-
dency.
Armed groups were inciting
civilians in border areas to flee
to neighboring countries "to
fabricate a refugee crisis," al-
Moallem said.
Up to 3,000 Syrians are leav-
ing the country every day, said
Vincent Cochetel of the U.N.
refugee agency. Some 300,000
Syrians are registered, or wait-
ing to register with the U.N. in
Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Leba-
non and the agency expects the
number to grow to 700,000 by
the year's end.
Al-Moallem called for a Syr-
ian-led dialogue to agree on a
roadmap to "a more plu-alistic
and democratic Syria."
His call, similar to other
overtures made by Assad's
regime, is unlikely to be heeded
by the opposition.

White House says it
thwarted cyber attack

Hackers tried to
infiltrate White
House computers'
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House is acknowledging
an attempt to infiltrate its com-
puter system, butsays it thwarted
the effort and that no classified
networks were threatened.
White House spokesman Jay
Carney told reporters the White
House is equipped with .iitiga-
tion measures that identified the
attack, isolated it and prevented
its spread.
He said there was no indica-
tion that any data was removed.
"There are distinctions
between those networks that
contain classified information
and those that don't, and the
attack was against an unclassi-
fied network," Carney said.
Carney described the attack
as "spear-phishing" and said
such efforts against government
computer systems are "not infre-
quent." Carney spoke in Hen-
derson, Nev., where President
Barack Obama is preparing for
his first debate against rival Mitt
Romney on Wednesday.
"Phishing" is a tactic that
involves sending an email that
falsely claims to be from a legiti-
mate enterprise in an attempt to
trick the user into turning over
information.
Last year, Google Inc. blamed
computer hackers in China for
a phishing effort against Gmail
accounts of several hundred

people, including senior U.S.
government officials and mili-
tary personnel. Last November,
senior U.S. intelligence offi-
cials for the first time publicly
accused China of systematically
stealing American high-tech
data for its own national eco-
nomic gain.
The White House would not
say whether the recent attack
was linked to China.
Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta, during a visit to China
last month, raised the subject
of China-based cyberattacks
against American companies
and the government.
News of the most recent
attack came as the Obama
administration - is preparing
an executive order with new
rules to protect U.S. computer
systems. After Congress failed
this summor to pass a compre-
hensive cybersecurity bill, the
White House said itfvwould use
executive branch authorities to
improve the nation's computer
security, especially for networks
tied to essential U.S. industries.
An initial draft of the order
included provisions for volun-
tary cybersecurity standards
for companies, a special coun-
cil run by the Homeland Secu-
rity Department and a review to
determine if existing cybersecu-
rity regulations are adequate.
But by issuing the execu-
tive order, the. White House
risks complaints that President
Barack Obama is anti-business
from Republicans and the same
pro-business groups that killed
the legislation on Capitol Hill.

FROM THE A
End modern slavery
Sex trafficking deserves attention and solutions
ith the election fast approaching, birth certificates
and tax returns seem to take precedence over serious
issues, including sex trafficking. However, it's still a
major problem in the United States. According to the National Cen-
ter for Missing and Exploited Children, at least 100,000 children
are trafficked annually in the United States. On Sept. 25, President
Obama specifically addressed the issue, calling on more people to
act against this "modern slavery." Obama's speech, though promis-
ing, was a small push in the larger war against sex trafficking. This
is an unsung issue in our country, and everyone from the president
to the average citizen needs to step up efforts to put an end to such

NOTABLE QOTABLE
I was lucky. In the next four years, 48,000
Americans won't be so lucky, because they'll
be murdered with guns in the next president's
term, enough to fill over 200 theaters."

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of over 600 mayors who advocate gun control.

an atrocious industry.
At the Clinton Global Initiative on Sept. 25,
President Obama announced plans to issue an
executive order implementing a zero-tolerance
policy when it comes to trafficking in gov-
ernment contracting. He emphasized proper
training for police, judges and educators when
dealing wit'h victims, and the need for fund-
raising efforts to help victims. He also called
on Congress to reauthorize the Trafficking
victims Protection Act, which aims to combat
traffickingbothdomestically andglobally. The
president rightfully designated human traf-
ficking as "one of the greatest human rights
battles of our era."
Here in Michigan, we're not so far removed
from incidents of sex trafficking. In May 2012,
a Detroit man was sentenced to three years in
prison for "conspiring to lure Eastern Euro-
pean women to the U.S." and forcing them to
become strippers. In 2001,this same man lured
two young Ukrainian women to the United
States and forced them to serve as exotic danc-
ers in Detroit. This is happening in Michigan,
yet the state isn't taking sufficient initiative to
put an end to it.
One of the largest forums for online traf-

ficking advertisements is Backpage.com, which
has 70 percent of the market share in prostitu-
tion ads. New York Times columnist Nicholas
Kristof has spoken up against the website, con-
demning the escort ad listings as a front for sex
trafficking in the United States. The website
doesn't validate age in its advertisements, nor
does it make sure the person is willing to pro-
vide the sexual services posted.
Sex trafficking is deplorable and a prevent-
able form of solicitation that we can greatly
reduce and eventually eliminate completely
through community and federal efforts.
Backpage.com needs to remove their person-
al ads and follow in the steps of other web-
sites, such as Craigslist, which is escort free
and still successful.
Awareness needs to be raised to help pre-
vent trafficking, aid victims and arrest those
profiting from this industry. It's the second
largest and fastest growing criminal industry
in the world, yet largely passed over by the
media. By taking steps to prevent sex traffick-
ing from happening, we, as a society, may be
able to release the chains and finally become
free from this modern form of slavery.

f you look at the University's
Maize Pages website - which
catalogues campus student
organizations
- you'll find an
entire "activ-
ism" category.
This category
encompasses
173 incredibly
diverse orga-
nizations, from ERIC
the . Universi-
ty's chapter of FERGUSON
Invisible Chil-
dren to a group
providing financial assistance to
students in Wayne County. All of
these disparate organizations have
a common aim of raising awareness
for a particular issue. In order for
an activist organization to exist,
people must first be aware of the
underlying issue and feel that it
needs to be addressed in some way.
Thus, awareness of an issue is
essential for the existence of all
activist organizations, not just stu-
dent-run ones. Remember Invisible
Children's Kony 2012 campaign?
The video that initially launched
the movement turns seven months
old this Friday, having garnered'
over 110-million views since its
release. It did an incredible job of
raising awareness in Americans
ages 18-29 of the deeds of Joseph
Kony, since 58 percent of them
were aware of the video within
10 days of its release. I found the
video 'through a friend's Facebook
page, and I remember being moved
almost to tears by the video and
pleased that so many people my age
were talking about it.
Despite how effective the cam-
paign was at raising awareness for

these under-discussed atrocities,
it was slammed with a withering
broadside of criticism for the man-
ner in which it advocated a solution
to the conflict. There are other con-
troversial issues that have reached
a significant sector of Americans
through traditional and social
media as well, such as the ongoing
civil war in Syria and the dispute
between Israel and Iran over the
latter's nuclear activities. When
organizations such as the Friends
of Syria Group or J-Street discuss
methods to remedy the issues, they,
become as vulnerable to criticism
as the Kony campaign proved to be.
An organization faces consider-
able hurdles if it wants to see its
exact prescription for an issue ful-
filled, and a major one of those is
fundraising. This isn't a straight-
forward process, since members
of the public that support an
organization on principle may not
be willing to make a significant
donation to an organization. Orga-
nizations also need some kind of
legitimizing and powerful force
behind their activities, whether
that's through the government or
through private institutions. The
Kony issue, for example, neces-
sitates military force that Invis-
ible Children isn't in any position
to provide. They've sought. pri-
vate donations and lobbied the
U.S. government to provide force.
However, opinions on those meth-
ods vary greatly. Criticism of an
activist organization encourages a
productive dialogue regarding the
best way to solve an issue.
This criticism has the poten-
tial to frustrate some of those on
this campus who are members of
Invisible Children or those who

fervently believe that Kony and
his Lord's Resistance Army need*
to be stopped immediately. How-
ever, that criticism will ultimately
benefit their cause. Awareness
of an issue is only a baby step on
the path to that issue's resolution.
Whether it's most feasible to cap-
ture or kill Kony, how to help those
affected by the LRA and how to
prevent another tragedy are three
questions that have a multitude of
answers. Larger-scale issues like
the Syrian civil war - involving
international diplomacy and tens
of thousands of deaths - are even
Criticism will
ultimately benefit
any cause.

S

more difficult to address.
But there's an even more impor-
tant reason why Invisible Children
and other organizations benefit
from the debate and criticism in
implementing their agendas. This
creates an environment where
many responses to issues can be
proposed, their merits examined
and their flaws exposed. Student
activists should know that though
awareness is fundamental to any
effort to address an issue, what
happens after awareness has been
raised is at least as important and
far more difficult a task.

An unexpected message

A friend recently told me she didn't believe
in voting. Intrigued, I pressed her with the
obvious question: why not? She told me that
she thought her one vote wouldn't matter
among the millions of votes cast on Nov. 6. As
she rattled off a list of reasons, I was forced to
reconsider whyI was voting in this election.
I'm voting because I believe we as stu-
dents should have the right to graduate with
the guarantee of jobs. The economy needs a
revival, backed by American workers and a
thriving middle class of educated Americans.
This is only possible if we provide all citizens
with the education necessary for success..
I'm voting because my friends of different
sexual orientation should have the right to
love who they choose, a right I've been guar-
anteed throughout my life.
I'm voting for my rights as a woman. I
believe that I should have the right to make
as much money as my male counterparts for
the same job, and the right to make medical
decisions about my own body.
Above all, I'm voting to move forward as a
nation.
This election, we Americans have to make
an important choice to either propel this coun-
try forward or to spiral backward into the past.
If we give up on our progress now, we'll
return to a time 93 years ago when women
were not treated as equals, a time 47 years
ago when contraception was illegal, a ltime
eight years ago when no state had legalized

gay marriage and to a time five years ago
when this economy was in the hands of a
select few institutions.
Although this backsliding may seem out of
the realm of possibility, it's all too real. The
threats of restricted abortion, a constitution-
al amendment to define marriage as between
a man and a woman and the deregulation
of the financial system that caused the eco-
nomic meltdown are all on the table for dis-
cussion. Without a strong opposition to these
ideas, they'll come to fruition and we'll have
no one to- blame but ourselves as we watch
our government turn back time.
whether you feel passionate about women's
health, marriage equality, the disappearing
middle class or countless other topics, vote in
this election and vote in Michigan. Although
a vote holds obvious meaning anywhere in
the United States, Michigan's importance as
a swing state means our votes are essential in
shaping this presidential election.
So to my friend who believes voting doesn't
matter, I have this to say: While I only have
one voice, I vote because I believe it's mine
alone to have. Don't'allow yours to be taken
away from you because you feel small or insig-
nificant. There are more than 300-million
individual voices in this country and you have
the right to claim yours.

The Power Center wasn't even
half full, yet somehow an attendance
record was set for the tour thus far -
which says a lot about Cain's lasting
popularity. I highly.doubt there was
one Republican in the crowd, except
for the chair of the University's
chapter of College Republicans. It
was 600 liberal arts students ready
to make a mockery out of this event
and man. On top of that, the open-
ing band was a group of guys singing
Britney Spears's "Toxic" accompa-
nied by violin. Picture that.
The second Cain took the stage
my first reaction was disbelief.
Did this guy really run for presi-
dent? His persona seemed forced.
He talked back to the audience
whenever someone shouted some-
thing outrageous. It felt like I was
watching stand-up comedy. But,
behind the laughs .(and trust me,
there were plenty) and the crowd
chanting "USA, USA,,USA" and "9,
9, 9", there were parts of his mes-
sage that resonated.
Cain discussed how the Ameri-
can dream still exists, even in an
LE T TE R TO T HE E DI TOR
Vote yes' on Proposal
3,for clean energy
TO THE DAILY:
As a University of Michigan
senior graduating during a tough
economic moment for our coun-
try and even tougher job market,
it feels as though so much of my
future is riding on the outcome of
the Nov. 6th elections. That's why
I'm so strongly in favor of Proposal
3 for increased reliance on clean

era of so much economic uncer-
tainty. He stressed the impor-
tance of everyone having their
own dreams and using goals as
stepping stones to reach them. He
told the crowd an uplifting story
about his father and his own rise
to success through jobs in the U.S.
Navy, Pillsbury, Burger King, God-
father's Pizza and even as a radio
talk show host. He may have got-
ten lucky at times, but there's no
questioning that he worked hard,
to get where he is today.
Although this event was hosted
by the College Republicans, it wasn't
particularly partisan. Cain said
Washington needs to be changed
and it will only happen if the public
demands it. That's something that I
can't disagree with. He also couldn't
help but comment that the demise
of his campaign was due to political
lies. That one's up for debate.
Toward the end of his remarks,
Cain made it clear through a hilari-
ous rant, that the United States is
the greatest country in the world,
which deservedly brought the audi-

ence to its feet. The lack of partisan
politics from a political figure was
refreshing and welcomed. He didn't
endorse Republican presidential
candidate Mitt- Romney and made
no reference to his own views as a
Republican. It was all about Amer-
ica, the positives and negatives and
the importance of an education.
It doesn't matter to me that his
views don't necessarily align with
mine because the fact is we're both
Americans who have achieved or
aim toward success. There's always
some form of common ground with
everyone, which is important to
keep in mind as we inch toward the
presidential election.
When the tour concludes at the
end of the year, my guess is that
Cain will fall into national obscu-
rity. My hope though, is that his
message will live on for a longtime.
Because what this out-there, crazy
guy taught me is that with a col-
lege education and a good attitude,
there's still hope.

Hip-hop artists discuss,
Islamic musical culture

Resistance
movements plays
role in developing
musical stylings
By KATIE SZYMANKSI
Daily StaffReporter
About 60 students took out
their ear buds and learned from
the artists on their playlists
firsthand about the unique con-
nection between music and the
Islamic religion at an event at
Rackham Amphitheatre on Mon-
day night.
The Islam & Hip Hop Panel
Discussion: The 5 Pillars & The
5 Elements - sponsored by the
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student
Affairs and developed by Hip
Hop Congress, a University orga-
nization that utilizes hip-hop
culture to spark social action,
and the Muslim Students' Asso-
ciation -addressed the historical
link between hip hop and Islam.
The event featured a question
and answer session with Muslim
hip-hop artists One Be Lo and
Langston Luv.
Amer Ahmed, the associate
director of MESA, emceed the
event, opening with a rap greet-
ing and moving into an in-depth
lecture on the interconnected-
ness of hip hop and the Islamic
community throughout history.
The presentation discussed
moments of struggle that helped
shape hip hop's creation, includ-
ing the slave trade involving the
Islamic population from West
Africa. Ahmed's presentation
highlighted' how the Islamic
faith was part of the guiding ide-
als of African-American culture
in North America, because both
groups spoke against resistance.
ADIDAS
From Page 1
University places on ensur-
ing that the workers who have
been involved in manufactur-
ing license products receive the
assistance they require and have
earned," Coleman wrote in the
letter.
Coleman's letter was addressed
to Patrik Nilsson, the president
5 of Adidas America and Gregg
Nebel, the head of the company's
Social and Environmental Affairs
department. Coleman wrote that
she acted in response to the rec-
ommendation of the University's
Advisory Committee on Labor
Standards and Human Rights,
which oversees the responsible
use and reproduction of the Uni-
versity's copyrighted logo.
"Adidas has acted laudably in
seeking and locating re-employ-
ment for former P.T. Kizone work-
ers and in pursuing improved
enforcement of labor laws, and
the University appreciates these
efforts," Coleman wrote. "How-
ever, it remains the committee's
considered view that the compa-
ny's response to the P.T. Kizone
situation is inadequate. I accept
the committee's assessment"
Adidas spokeswoman Lauren
Lamkin acknowledged that the
company responded to Coleman's

letter last week, but declined to
release the reply letter. But she
did say the workers' well-being is
a concern for Adidas.
"Importantly, we are mak-
ing headway in leading industry
efforts to develop sustainable
business solutions that address the
systemic root cause of unethical
factory closures around the globe,
and protecting workers impacted
by them," the statement said.
The apparel company said it
works with governments, indus-
try groups and other companies
to investigate poor labor condi-
tions in factories it contracts for
manufacturing.
"We work with hundreds of
factories in our supply chain
every year to ensure fair, healthy
and safe working conditions,"
the company said. "We measure

"There is a continuation of
oral tradition and the delivery
of these messages of identity, of
reclaiming of identity, of resis-
tance through the use of oral tra-
dition," Ahmed said.
He explained how the resis-
tance movement fueled the cre-
ation of a genre of music that
embodied the same ideologies.
"This culture of resistance
was very much part of the iden-
tity of people connected to Islam-
based ideologies, but it was also
part of the cultivation of hip-hop
culture," Ahmed said. "Hip-hop
culture is a counterculture; it's
a resistance to hegemonic forces
and systems of oppression."
After Ahmed's introductory
presentation, One Be Lo and
Langston Luv appeared on a
panel to answer questions and
demonstrate their rapping tal-
ents. Luv addressed how it can
be difficult to be a hip-hop artist
that also identifies as Muslim.
"I'm almost fearful because
I, don't want to become (or)
appear as if I'm some poster-boy
for Islam," Luv said. "I would
misrepresent it personally; I do
things that are maybe against the
permissibility of Islam."
He added that many well-
known hip-hop artists such as
Lupe Fiasco are associated with
Islam and place Islamic refer-
ences in their music.
"The jewels that these people
are sharing are a part of their
gift and a part of their faith," Luv
added.
During the question and
answer session, One. Be Lo
described his process of convert-
ing from Christianity to Islam,
and how he. was introduced to
Islamic faith during his time in
prison. He explained how his
original views towards Islamic
faith changed during this time.

"I was comingto Islam in stag-
es," One Be Lo said. "When I first
heard about Islam, I thought it
was about 'The white man is the
devil,' and when I started read-
ing the Quran, (I learned) it was
nothing like that. It was a real
beautiful thing to me."
In an interview after the
event, One Be Lo said music is
a universal language that is all
encompassing.
"Maybe we don't speak the
same language and totally dif-
ferent backgrounds, but we both
like this beat," he said.
LSA freshman Dakota
DeGroot said he attended
because of his interests in hip-
hop music and Islam.
"I like to write music (and) I
write a lot of hip hop," DeGroot
said. "It's something that I've
really loved my entire life. On the
religious side, I tend to believe
in the general beliefs of Islam,
so it's culminating two things
that I feel strongly about into one
event."

ism committee chair, said the
event was important for spread-
ing knowledge about various
aspects of Islam.
"(The event) helps to give a
greater awareness of what Islam
is," Kherallah said. "It is not real-
ly one dimensional. Islam relates
to so many things."
LSA junior Zach Kendall, the
president of Hip Hop Congress,
said the event was successful in
uniting a variety of people from
many backgrounds.
"We like to get people in a
space, in the name of hip hop,"
Kendall said. "We want to bring
people together that wouldn't
normally be in the same space
... for me, this was an extremely
successful event."

sional ambitions I might .have.
And in the 1950s, he was statis-
tically right, but he was wrong
about me."
The last chapter of her book
boasts the title "Having It All."
"What I mean by that is, look-
ing back at my advanced age, I
realized that I've been able to do
what my father wanted me to do,
which is use whatever intellectual
capacities you have," Whitman
said.
"I managed to be very happily
married for 56 years to the man I
announced at the age of 17 I would
marry. And we had two terrific
children and two terrific grand-
children. And so, in a sense, all
* those expectations merged," she
added.
Using two distinct anecdotes,
Whitman's second focus in the
book is how society has changed
during her lifetime. In the first,
she describes how she was turned
down for a prospective job oppor-
tunity at IBM because the rfcruit-
er saw she was engaged to be
married.
"I stood up and apologized for
taking up his time and left," Whit-

Twitter had that capability,"
Foreman said. "Soit's really quite
incredible."
As a result of government
restrictions, individuals living in
China are prohibited from access-
ing Twitter, Facebook or You-
Tube, and turn to Weibo for their
social networking fix. On Weibo,
people make profiles to create and
comment on 140-character Weibo
posts, photos and videos that their
followers can view.
The University's Weibo profile
currently has about 4,000 follow-
ers, comprised primarily of peo-
ple from Beijing and Shanghai.
"(Weibo is) the mostimportant
source of information for a large
segment of the Chinese popula-
tion," Foreman said. "Right now
the most recent estimates are
400 million Chinese are using
Weibo."
According to Weibo analytics,
Foreman said the University's
Weibo site was the most influen-

man said. "He was completely in
his rights. I could have kicked and
screamed on the floor and threw a
fit, and it would have made abso-
lutely no difference. There was no
(Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission), nothing."
The second anecdote dis-
cusses Whitman's application to
Princeton University for a Ph.D.
in economics; the economics
department invited her to apply,
yet turned her down for a simple
reason.
"I went to see the president (of
Princeton). And what the conver-
sation boiled down to was, 'I'm
so sorry, Mrs. Whitman, we can
accept a student of your caliber,
but we just don't have enough
ladies' rooms.'
"And I think the message for
younger people, young women,
but young people in general today,
is that it is still within my lifetime
that things have changed," Whit-
man said.
"It took the work of a lot of peo-
ple to get there despite the fact
that there are still plenty of prob-
lems," she said. "And it's fragile;
it could disappear. And I think in
the current political environment
the notion of that fragility, and
the fact that it takes some work to
make sure we move forward and
not backward, is relevant."
tial American university profile
and ranked fourth among other
global university Weibo sites.
The University's Weibo,
account also serves to attract
prospective . students overseas
and publicize the University's
acclaimed programs, while also
allowing alumni to remain con-
nected.
Foreman and Zhangsendthree
posts a day and post pictures and
videos regarding University mat-
ters, deriving their content from
campus life and University activ-
ities. Foreman said the program
attracts viewers of a wide age
range of users, including parents
and alumni.
Foreman added that the page
allows the University to promote
school spirit overseas.
"It's a great platform for
engagement," Foreman said. "For
example, during (the) Michi-
gan-Alabama football game, I
was (posting) quarterly scores
on Weibo, and alumni in China
started sending me pictures of
parties that they were having."
Foreman specifically noted

Having served in such power-
ful positions during her career,
Whitman said the media was
much 'to blame for continuing
stereotypes about women in the
workplace.
"The very worst were the
Fourth Estate," Whitnan said.
"The press was appalling. Every
headline was, 'Woman Econo-
mist' Half of them would write
things about my looks and my
clothes and whether the family
gerbil survived the trip to Wash-
ington. I mean the press reports
were about as sexist as you could
get."
In the gallery of the Hatcher
Graduate Library on Tuesday,
Whitman will read the prologue
to "The Martian's Daughter,"
take questions and sign cop-
ies of the book. There, one can
ask about her dream job on the
Council of Economic Advisors -
and why she eventually chose to
resign in 1973.
"Like many people, I suc-
cumbed to the vanity of thinking,
'Well, if rm involved in it, it'll do
less harm than if someone else
was involved,' "Whitman said.
As hinted by the book's title
- which references a nickname
given to her father by his col-
leagues - like Martian father,
like Martian daughter.
an instance last spring when
he posted a photo of maize and
blue cookies at a Ross School of
Business graduation event. The
photo was reposted by a Hong
Kong investment banker who is a
University alum with more than
10,000 followers, many of whom
are former Ross students.
"The coolest part of it was
people started tweeting back to
her, 'Oh, I didn't know you went
to Ross.' This was great exposure
for the University... That's what
we're doing. We're tryingto raise
the awareness of the University
of Michigan overseas," Foreman
said.
University students who use
Weibo feel that it has become an
important part of their lives.
Dang Shuodong, a Business
and Engineering junior and a
Chinese international student,
said he has used Weibo since it
first started.
"I basically go on Weibo every
single day," Dang said' "On
Weibo, I tweet about college life
... other times I retweet other
people's tweets."


factories' performance, 'as well
as our efficacy in resolving these
issues."
In the statement, Adidas
announced that it has called
for a summit of manufacturers,
financing institutions, insurance
experts and other firms in part-
nership with the Global Forum
for Sustainable Supply Chains,
an industry advocacy group, to
form a private insurance fund for
workers affected by the factory
closures and lack of compensa-
tion. The forum is scheduled to
take place in Switzerland later
this month.
Adidas claims the use of an
insurance fund, which the com-
pany is calling a "provident
fund," will provide relief in coun-
tries that require severance pay
by law, but don't ensure employ-
ers have sufficient funds to fulfill
severance obligations.
In addition to a job placement
program and a $250,000 food aid
program that Adidas said it has
provided for the former employ-
ees of P.T, Kizone, the company
announced in the statement that
'it would pledge an additional
$275,000 in humanitarian aid.,
"As a company, we are sym-
pathetic to the plight of workers
impacted by the unethical clo-
sure of the P.T. Kizone factory in
Indonesia," the statement said.
"Although the Adidas Group had
no business relationship with the
factory for nearly six months prior
to its closure, we are the leaders
in the industry and, accordingly,
the Adidas Group has directly
dedicated more towards the for-
mer P.T. Kizone workers than any
other brand."
In March, University students
met with Nebel to discuss the con-
troversy, asking the executive to
leave after 30 minutes of intense
questioning.
At the time, Nebel said the
meeting made no progress in find-
ing a solution to concerns with the
company's handling of the dis-
pute.
"That wasn't very respectful to
just make me dismissed like that,
and that is a little disconcerting,"
Nebel said. .

United Students against Sweat-
shops released aletter on Monday
praising Coleman's recognition of,
the issue with Adidas, but also
criticizing her for not going far
enough in "targeting the true
problem."
"As we have seen from past
groundbreaking campaigns
against Nike and Russell Athlet-
ic, apparel brands only respond
to universities making credible
threats of contract loss if they fail
to remediate their code of con-
duct violations," the letter stated.
"Given this reality, we call on you
to put Adidas on notice, and if the
company fails to pay the legally
mandated severance within the
contractual remediation period,
then the University should termi-
nate its $60 million contract with
Adidas."
The letter also stated that
USAS took issue with the services
that Adidas has offered to the for-
mer P.T. Kizone employees, writ-
ing that the food vouchers were
a cheaper way of getting out of
paying the actual severance pay
owed to the workers.
Public Policy senior Michael
Guisinger, a member of USAS,
said although the organization
was pleased to see Coleman rec-
ognizing the problem, they were
dissatisfied that Coleman did not
directly threaten the partnership.
"We're not entirely satis-
fied," Guisigner said. "It does not
threaten actually severing the
contract. What we wanted was
for the University to say, 'If you
don't do something about this,
we're going to have to end ties
with you.' There's none of that in
the letter."
In September, a representative
of USAS presented the group's
case before the University's
Board of Regents at the board's
month meeting.
The University of Wisconsin
and Cornell University have pre-
viously expressed their concerns
about Adidas' conduct in the P.T.
Kizone case. Earlier this year,
the University of Wisconsin-
Madison sued Adidas, alleging
it was not in compliance with its
contract with the university. The

"It is not an aggressive

He said he planned to fly to
Lima, Peru later Monday for a
summit of South American and
Arab leaders and then undergo
surgery on his return to Bogota
on Wednesday.
Santos said the surgery
would be performed under local
anesthetic so he would not need
to relinquish temporarily his
presidential responsibilities.
Santos said his doctors told
him the surgery places him
in no danger, "but they have
recommended that after the
surgery and after I leave the
hospital, I don't travel for

He was also joined by his
doctor, Felipe Gomez, who
characterized Santos' situation
as "common among men."

Hoke, offensive line vowto
protect Robinson in backfield

Hockey season TV
schedule released

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Nobody's denying that Denard
Robinson struggled mightily in
the Michigan football team's
13-6 loss to Notre Dame. Robin-
son ended five consecutive drives
with turnovers - including four
interceptions on four straight
throws.
Robinson apologized to the
team and the Michigan fan base
after the game, calling it the
worst game of his career. But his
teammates and coaches down-
played Robinson's struggles by
attributing the woes to the col-
lective offensive effort.
The offensive line, in particu-
lar, took some heat.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
entered the locker room at half-
time with offensive coordinator
Al Borges at his heels. The Wol-
verines trailed 10-0. Something
had to change.
Robinson hadn't done him-
self any favors, but he certainly
wasn't getting much help. He'd
been sacked twice, had pressure
in his face constantly through
two quarters and had passed for
just 59 yards.
"When you look at the process,
it's not all one guy," Hoke said on
Monday. "When you've got a line-
backer in your face and you've got
somebody around your leg, some-
times it's hard to finish plays like
you'd like to.
O "Do we want him to throw the
ball away when the opportunity's
there? Do we want him to be a
little more on target with the ball
at times? No question. But it's not
just him by any count."
When he stepped into the
locker room at halftime, Hoke
said that "the rest of this game
is on the offensive line," accord-
ing to redshirt junior right tackle
Taylor Lewan. Borges adjusted
his scheme to buy Robinson time.
"I was pretty fired up about
the situation - a lot of guys
were," Lewan said. "Every single
guy who played in that game as
an offensive lineman took that to
heart."
And it worked. Though Robin-
son and the offense couldn't fin-

INJURIES: Redshirt junior
defensive end Nathan Brink suf-
fered an undisclosed injury dur-
ing practice last week and will
*be out indefinitely, according to
a release from the Michigan foot-
ball program.
Brink made two tackles in four
games this season.
Hoke said the rest of the
injured players - those who
don't have season-ending inju-
ries, that is - have returned to
practice and should be able to
play on Saturday against Purdue.
That lineup includes sophomore
defensive end Brennen Beyer
(knee), fifth-year senior tight end
Brandon Moore (knee), fifth-year
senior left guard Ricky Barnum
(shoulder), junior fullback Ste-
phen Hopkins (hamstring), red-
shirt sophomore defensive tackle
Richard Ash (undisclosed) and
junior safety Marvin Robinson
(undisclosed).

unique in that it neatly divides this Saturday.

The Wolverines have done a
good job of staying sharp com-
ing off bye weeks in recent years,
having won eight of their last
nine games in such situations.
Last season, they also faced the
Boilermakers in their initial
post-bye- game, and that ended
as a 36-14 win for Hoke and his
team.
To help stave off any poten-
tial lethargy, Hoke said the first
team offense and defense scrim-
maged frequently during the bye
week practices.
"A lot of competition, because
of the speed of the game we want
to play with," Hoke said. "I think
that's helped over the years."
"It just sharpens you, because
we have a lot of great guys on
offense who are great players, so
it just keeps you where you need
to be at to play at a very high
level," added Roh.
The extra practices last week
also should prove beneficial for
the young players seeing time
for the Wolverines, and there
are plenty of those, especially on

defense. Five true freshmen and
four second-year players have
seen significant time so far for
defensive coordinator Greg Mat-
tison.
Hoke mentioned that many of
his first-year players were able
to go home during the week-
end since they live within driv-
ing distance, and he thinks that
should help them out mentally
after what's likely been a head-
spinning month for them.
But it's back to the grind for

the team, and Hoke said he's
already waiting to see how his
players respond in practice
on Tuesday after the rest they
received.
Lwan said it was good tohave
the time off that he and his team-
mates did - it's the last opportu-
nity they'll have until December,
after the regular season is over.
By then, Michigan will know
whether its season was a suc-
cess or whether it was the "fail-
ure" Hoke has termed last year's

non-Big Ten championship cam-
paign.

What sepa-
rates Miguel from his R&B con-
temporaries is the fact that his
music can't be defined by the
standard R&B guidelines. He
lacks the dance moves of fisher,
the multi-octave vocal range of
R. Kelly and even the soulful-
ness of Raphael Saadiq. A more
apt comparison would be a 21st-
century Prince - a man in a

Miguel's debut, 2010's All

received solid reviews. That
being said, for every experimen-
tal and soulful slow jam on the
album, there was a songthat was

Blame it on the major label influ-
ence, but listening to the album,
you get the feeling that there
was something Miguel was
holding back, something even
freakier, even wilder - the true,
down and dirty Miguel.
Kaleidoscope Dream, Miguel's
second album, is the unhin-
dered expression of this pent-
up emotion. The opening track,
"Adorn," a standout from the
album and his most success-
ful song to date, simply gives
you that feeling: Miguel hits
every note, the beat is funky and
smooth and you can't help but
sing along. Remember, though,
Miguel is not an R&B singer, and
Kaleidoscope Dream is markedly

Most Americans aren't famil-
iar with Cher Lloyd's journey
through Simon
Cowell's "The
X Factor U.K.,"
so many default Cher Lloyd
to labeling her
as "the one that Sticks and
grunts" in this Stones
summer's hit
song "Want U Epic
Back." With
Lloyd's rough-and-tough, Sticks
and Stones attitude, this label isn't
too far off.
This album is the embodiment
of quirkiness. "Grow Up" is prac-
tically a competition between
Lloyd and Busta Rhymes to find
out who can spit out words the
fastest. Asa white Britishi girl, her
intense rap verses should be the
most tacky, annoying aspect ever
thrown into an album, but some-
how it sounds natural and fun.
It doesn't end with rap either.
If a bit of dubstep on "Over the
Moon" and "Playa Boi" isn't
enough, the song "Dub On the
Track" delivers exactly what it
promises. Imagine that. It's not
radio friendly in the slightest;
major bonus points for creativity.
One of the simpler playful
tracks, "With Ur Love," was a
major hit in the UK and originally
featured vocals by Mike Pos-
ner. The bouncy beat of Lloyd's
lighthearted vibe brings back the
mood of Fergie's "Clumsy." Pos-
ner was removed from the song
for the US release, which essen-
tially removed the aspect hat
would have drawn in American
listeners, which is unfortunate
because he does little in the way
