Local eateries offer
good food at steep
discounts
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
Eat well, students. It might
be the only week you can -
affordably, at least.
On Monday, local restau-
rants kicked off Ann Arbor's
Restaurant Week, a long-
standing city tradition, which

provides students on a budget
with an opportunity to try res-
taurants normally reserved for
a wealthier clientele.
Running through Jan. 17,
patrons can enjoy seven days
of lunch and dinner specials
at fixed prices at 58 down-
town Ann Arbor restaurants.
Throughout the week, partici-
pating venues serve lunch for
$15 and three-course dinners
for $28 - with some restau-
rants offering two for one pric-
ing.
While the event is also held

annually in June, this week's
event will feature more partici-
pating restaurants, including
The Original Cottage Inn, Grat-
zi, Cafe Zola and Frita Batidos,
among others.
Maura Thomson, director of
the Main Street Area Associa-
tion, said the January event is
usually busier than its summer
counterpart because there are
fewer competing special events
offered in the winter in Ann
Arbor.
"We typically try to choose
weeks where restaurants are

historically very slow," Thom-
son said. "We're trying to help
restaurants get a little more
business and give people the
opportunity to try these new
places during a time when it
is not as busy and your odds of
getting a table are better."
Aventura and The Lunch
Room are new additions to
Restaurant Week. Aventura is
a tapas restaurant run by the
owner of Sava's on State Street
and The Lunch Room is a new
vegan restaurant located in

EAT UP

Prof. acheives German honors

Andrei Markovits is an Arthur
F. Thurnau Professor and the Karl
W. Deutsch Collegiate Profes-
sor of Comparative Politics and
German Studies at the Univer-
sity. In 2012, The Federal Repub-
lic of Germany honored him with
the Federal Cross of the Order of
Merit, an award recognizing indi-
viduals who have done a "service
to the nation" of Germany.
What's your favorite class
to teach?
My sports class (German 379:
Sports, Politics and Society). I
love the topic, I love the scope.
I just love it.

You've written a lot of
books in your career. Which
are you most proud of and
why?
Probably "Offside: Soccer
& American Exceptionalism"
because when I wrote that, very
few academics wrote serious
books on sports. In the mean-
time, it's become very normal.
But when I published that and
worked on that, it was still quite
rare.
What does winning The
Federal Cross of the Order of
Merit in 2012 mean to you as a
scholar of German studies?

It's the highest honor that
the Center Republic of Germany
gives to anybody. I'm not quite
believing that I got it. That's a
very, very high honor. And it
was not only for my scholar-
ship on Germany, but also for
my helping lots of German aca-
demics and German students
but also helping many Ameri-
cans. It's basically for German-
American relations. It's not an
academic award. It also includes
my work as an academic, but it's
also not for what I did but for
who I am, so to speak. Namely,
that I played this important role
in German-American relations.

Supreme Court works to reach Trial continues for German
decision on recess appointments man accused of murder

Administration's
lawyer is hard pressed
to defend the system
WASHINGTON (AP) - Just
back from their own long break,
Supreme Court justices set out
Monday to resolve a politically
charged fight over when the Sen-
ate's absence gives the president
the power to make temporary
appointments to high-level posi-
tions without senators' approval.
The legal battle is the out-
growth of partisan rancor over
presidential appointees that has
characterized Washington over
the past 20 years, and especially
since President Barack Obama
took office in 2009.
Recess appointments have
divided Democrats and Repub-
licans, with views changing
depending on which party holds
the White House. But during
more than 90 minutes of argu-

ments Monday, the Obama admin-
istration was hard pressed to find
support for its stand in favor of
recess appointments from justices
named by Republicans and Demo-
crats alike - including Obama.
Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama
nominee, seized on the politi-
cal dispute to make the point to
Solicitor General Donald Verrilli
Jr. that "congressional intransi-
gence" to Obama nominees may
not be enough to win the court
fight.
Kagan, Verrilli's predecessor as
Obama's top Supreme Court law-
yer, suggested that it "is the Sen-
ate's role to determine whether
they're in recess."
The court is writing on a blank
slate as it considers for the first
time the Constitution's recess
appointments clause. That clause
allows the president to fill vacan-
cies temporarily, but only when
the Senate is in recess.
The constitutional issue maybe
new to the court, but two justices

H-o-

lived through the political tussle
over nominations. Both Chief Jus-
tice John Roberts and Kagan were
nominated to the federal appeals
court in Washington, but saw
their nominations blocked in the
Senate. Roberts eventually won
confirmation, but Kagan did not.
And one of the lawyers involved
in Monday's case withdrew his
nomination to the same court.
The Senate has "an absolute
right not to confirm nominees
that the President submits," Rob-
erts said.
The administration was "latch-
ing onto" the constitutional pro-
vision to combat the Senate's
refusal to act, even though it was
written to deal with an era when
horseback was the fastest mode of
transportation and Congress was
absent from Washington for long
periods, Roberts said.
Even Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, perhaps Verrilli's most sym-
pathetic questioner, said at one
point, "I think to be candid, the
Senate is always available. They
can be called back on very short
notice."
Monday's case, the first argu-
ment at the court in more than a
month, is a dispute over Obama's
appointments to the National
Labor Relations Board in January
2012. Republicans and employers
who objected to NLRB decisions
made by those Obama appointees
say the Senate was not in recess
when Obama acted, and so any
decisions made by the board were
illegitimate.
There are three questions
before the court - whether recess
appointments can be made only
during the once-a-year break
between sessions of Congress,
whether the vacancy must occur
while the Senate is away in order
to be filled during the same break
and whether brief, pro forma ses-
sions of the Senate, held every few
days to break up a longer Senate
hiatus, can prevent the president
from making recess appoint-
ments. -
The latter question offers the
court a narrower way to rule on
recess appointments.

49-year-old Muth
allegedly killed
91-year-old wife
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Jurors in the trial of a German
man charged with killing his
91-year-old wife were shown
bloody crime scene photo-
graphs Monday and a portion
of an interview with homicide
detectives in which he referred
to the couple's relationship as a
"marriage of convenience."
Albrecht Muth, 49, also
describes in matter-of-fact
fashion how he found the life-
less body of his wife, Viola
Drath, in a bathroom of their
home but decided that it would
be futile to even try to resusci-
tate her.
"The obvious was obvious,"
Muth can be heard telling the
pair of detectives.
Muth is charged with first-
degree murder in the August
2011 beating and strangulation
death of Drath, a German jour-
nalist and socialite. He faces
life in prison if convicted.
The interview, recorded in
a cramped police interroga-
tion room in the days between
the discovery of Drath's body
and her husband's arrest, gave
jurors their closest look yet at
the defendant: Muth has been
absent from the trial, partici-
pating passively through vid-
eoconference, after doctors
said his self-imposed starvation
made him too weak to appear
in court. He has been fasting
off-and-on for what he says are
religious reasons.
The case is expected to go to
the jury later this week.
Muth's lawyers say he is
innocent and that there's no
evidence he killed his wife.
Prosecutors, meanwhile, say
Muth lived off a monthly allow-
ance from his wife that had
recently been reduced and that
he killed Drath in hopes of col-
lecting a portion of her estate.
In the segment of the video

jurors saw, the detectives asked
Muth to walk them through
the discovery of Drath's body
but did not ask whether he had
anything to do with her death.
When one of the detectives
noted the large age difference
and asked whether the couple
were intimate, Muth replied,
"We had a marriage of conve-
nience."
Muth called police early on
Aug. 12, 2011, to report finding
his wife dead in a third-floor
bathroom of the home they
shared in Georgetown, a posh
Washington neighborhood.
Investigators initially treat-
ed the death as one of natural
causes but settled on Muth as
the suspect after finding no
signs of forced entry and deter-
mining that he and Drath were
the only ones home at the time
she died. A crime scene techni-
cian testified Monday that none
of the windows to the home had
been opened. Another inves-
tigator said he found Inter-
net searches on Muth's laptop
computer for flights to Iceland,
crossing the Canadian border,
extradition arrangements with
Mexico and challenging a pre-
nuptial agreement.
Also Monday, Latoya
Jamison, a forensic investigator
with the D.C. medical examin-
er's office, said Muth appeared
anxious and fidgety but oth-
erwise emotionless after she
came to the home to take pho-
tographs and inspect the body.
She said he seemed especially
curious to know the cause of
death and whether any trauma
was found that could explain it.
One of Drath's daughters testi-
fied that Muth told her that her
mother had been having bal-
ance problems, but she said that
surprised her since her mother
had been in excellent physical
health.
With Drath's daughters and
other relatives present in the
courtroom, prosecutors pre-
sented graphic photographs of
Drath sprawled out dead on the
bathroom floor. A large, bloody

gash covered her neck, another
wound was found on the back
of her neck and aifngernail had
been nearly ripped off, Jamison
said.
She said the position of
Drath's body struck her as
peculiar for someone who
would have died from a fall,
as Muth had maintained, or
of natural causes. She said it
appeared likely that Drath had
died somewhere else in the
house and then been placed in
the bathroom, which prosecu-
tors contend is what happened.
One of Drath's daughters,
Connie Drath Dwyer, also testi-
fied that Muth had begun pres-
suring her mother for money
and insisted that he be able to
keep items of household furni-
ture upon her death.
She recalled how he was
wearing eye patch the first time
they met - he said he lost his
eye to injury - and made refer-
ence to having been a merce-
nary soldier in South America.
She said she never again saw
him with a patch and never
noticed problems with his eye.
Prosecutors contend the
patch was part of a web of
elaborate fictions that Muth
spun about his professional
career and connections. He had
claimed to be a brigadier gen-
eral with the Iraqi army, but
the military uniform he would
wear around the neighborhood
was actually purchased and he
had no authentic army connec-
tions, prosecutors say.
Drath's daughter also testi-
fied that Muth balked when she
asked him to compose an obitu-
ary for her mother, even though
he wrote about his wife all the
time and regularly prepared
speeches for her. She said she
ultimately wrote up an obituary
that said her mother had died
after being injured in a fall, con-
sistent with what Muth had told
the family.
"The papers always like to
have a cause of death," she
explained. "I thought I had to
put something in."

Man sets Walmart
aflame, steals iPads
and flees premises
Police in southwestern Michi-
gan are searching for a man who
wore a mask when he set fire to
baby clothes at a Walmart store,
then went to the electronics
department where he smashed
a display case and stole several
iPads.
The Berrien County sheriff's
department says the robbery hap-
pened about 4:45 a.m. Sunday at a
Walmart store in Niles Township.
It's about 20 miles south-south-
east of Benton Harbor.
The department says the man
fled out the front door and drove
off.
MLive.com says investigators
have surveillance video showing
a man they think is the suspect
also trying to steal electronic
items at the store on Saturday.
The say he wasn't masked then.
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Court-martial of
Naval student will
begin in March
The court-martial of a U.S.
Naval Academy midshipman
accused in a sexual assault case is
now scheduled to begin in March
after a military judge agreed to
delay the proceeding, which had
been scheduled for February.
A military judge on Monday
said the court-martial, the mili-
tary's equivalent of a trial, for
Joshua Tate of Nashville, Tenn.,
will begin with the selection of
the military jury on March 14.
Opening statements will begin on
March 17.
Tate's lawyers had asked for
the start of the trial to be delayed
in part because charges against
another man involved in the
case, Eric Graham of Eight Mile,
Ala., were dropped last week.
Tate is now the sole remaining
defendant facing charges, though
prosecutors had initially accused
three men in connection with the
case.

PHOENIX, Ariz.
Court rejects 20-
week deadline for
state abortions
The Supreme Court on Mon-
day rejected Arizona's attempt to
implement a ban on most abor-
tions after 20 weeks of pregnancy,
a development that doesn't dis-
turb most of the similar prohibi-
tions that other states have on the
books.
The justices declined to recon-
sider a federal appeals court's rul-
ing that the Arizona law violates a
woman's constitutionally protect-
ed right to terminate a pregnancy
before a fetus is able to survive
outside the womb.
"Viability" of a fetus is general-
ly considered to start at 24 weeks.
Normal pregnancies run about 40
weeks.
Gov. Jan Brewer signed the ban
into law in April 2012. Nine other
states have enacted similar bans
starting at 20 weeks or even ear-
lier.

economic reward for Iran

Obama warns
against sanctions
during meeting
with Spanish P.M.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
weekend deal spelling out how
Iran will roll back its nuclear
program in exchange for sanc-
tions relief buttresses the
Obama administration's argu-
ment Tehran may be prepared
for a grand diplomatic com-
promise averting the potential
for war. But it has done little
to sway skeptical lawmakers
determined to levy new sanc-
tions against Iran.
With world powers and
Iran set to start the clock on
their six-month interim agree-
ment Jan. 20, a parallel show-
down looms between President
Barack Obama and Congress
over legislative action each side
says has serious implications
for the chances of diplomatic
success. Obama warns add-
ing more sanctions could kill
negotiations; legislators insist
they're the only way to ensure
Iran keeps 06 word. Much cduld~
depend on Tehran quickly mak-
ing good on its commitments.
"Now is not the time to
impose new sanctions," Obama
said Monday as he met with
Spanish Prime Minister Mari-
ano Rajoy.
White House press secretary
Jay Carney said the fact Iran's
government was now imple-
menting what has been agreed
"demonstrates that at the very
least, testing whether or not
Iran is serious is the right thing
to do."
The question of sanctions is
essentially a tactical dispute
over the best way to achieve a
shared goal: preventing Iran
from acquiring nuclear weap-

ons and delivering an exis-
tential threat to Israel, while
fundamentally reshaping the
power dynamics of the Mid-
dle East. But for the Obama
administration, the pressure
from Congress has proven a
constant headache at precisely
the moment Iran's moderate-
sounding President Hassan
Rouhani is offering unprece-
dented flexibility in talks.
The administration reached
a milestone in its strategy Sun-
day. The U.S. and its five negoti-
ating partners - Britain, China,
France, Germany and Rus-
sia - secured a deal with Iran
articulating how the Islamic
republic will scale back its ura-
nium enrichment program,
halt progress at a plutonium
plant and open up key sites
to daily inspectors beginning
next week. In exchange, world
powers outlined how they will
phase in $7 billion worth of
relief from international sanc-
tions that have crippled Iran's
economy. The full agreement
has yet tobe made public.
The agreement "will advance
our goal of preventing Iran
from obtaining a nuclear weap-
on," Obama declared in a state-
ment Sunday. He reiterated a
threat to veto any new sanc-
tions legislation from Congress,
saying such action risks "derail-
ing our efforts." Carney added
Monday that new sanctions are
"wholly unnecessary" because
Congress could always act later.
The implementation agree-
ment provides the nuts and
bolts to November's break-
through interim deal with
Iran, an arrangement that can
be extended by six additional
months. Negotiators hope to
replace it with a comprehen-
sive accord this year ending the
threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.
Iranian reformers and mod-
erate conservatives welcomed

the agreement Monday, while
hardliners repeated their oppo-
sition. Iran's leaders say ura-
nium and plutonium activity
is designed solely for peaceful
nuclear energy and medical
research purposes, but the
United States and many other
countries fear Tehran is covert-
ly advancing toward atomic
weapons capability. Israel and
Iran's Sunni Arab rivals such
as Saudi Arabia have been
most vocal in their skepticism
of diplomacy, their concerns
echoed by a growing chorus in
Congress..
Fifty-nine senators now back
the latest proposed U.S. sanc-
tions package, which they say
would increase the pressure on
Iran to make concessions and
fully dismantle - not simply
slow down - the entire nucle-
ar program. The count takes
sanctions proponents closer to
being able to push a bill through
Congress and override even a
presidential veto. The House
overwhelmingly supports addi-
tional economic pressure on
Tehran.
No sanctions vote is expect-
ed imminently. Congressio-
nal aides said top proponents
such as Democratic Sens. Bob
Menendez of New Jersey and
Chuck Schumer of New York
were waiting for the best oppor-
tunity to push the issue, with
much of the focus now on build-
ing a stronger coalition. Some
Senate aides cited early Febru-
ary as the earliest possibility.
The legislation under consid-
eration would blacklist several
Iranian industrial sectors and
threaten banks and companies
around the world with being
banned from the U.S. market if
they help Iran export any more
oil. The provisions would take
effect if Tehran violates the
interim deal or lets it expire
without a final agreement.

Discriminatory
laws influence some
to flee the country
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) - A
new law in Nigeria, signed
by the president without
announcement, has made it
illegal for gay people to even
hold a meeting. The Same Sex
Marriage Prohibition Act also
criminalizes homosexual clubs,
associations and organizations,
with penalties of up to 14 years
in jail.
The act has drawn interna-
tional condemnation from coun-
tries such as the United States
and Britain.
Some Nigerian gays already
have fled the country because
of intolerance of their sexual
persuasion, and more are con-
sidering leaving, if the new law
is enforced, human rights activ-
ist Olumide Makanjuola said
recently.
Nigeria's law is not as draco-
nian as a Ugandan bill passed
by parliament last month which
would punish "aggravated"
homosexual acts with life in
prison. It awaits the president's
signature.
But Nigeria's law reflects a
highly religious and conserva-
tive society that considers homo-
sexuality a deviation. Nigeria is
one of 38 African countries -
about 70 percent of the continent
- that have laws persecutinggay
people, according to Amnesty
International.
The Associated Press on Mon-
day obtained a copy of the Same
Sex Marriage Prohibition Act,
which was signed by President
Goodluck Jonathan and dated
Jan. 7.
It was unclear why the law's
passage has been shrouded in
secrecy. The copy obtained
from the House of Represen-
tatives in Abuja, the Nigerian
capital, showed it was signed by
lawmakers and senators unani-
mously on Dec. 17, though no
announcement was made.
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry said Monday the United
States is "deeply concerned" by
a law that "dangerously restricts
freedom of assembly, associa-
tion, and expression for all Nige-
rians."
Former colonizer Britain said,
"The U.K. opposes any form of
discrimination on the grounds
of sexual orientation."
A statement from the spokes-
man for the British High Com-
mission, traditionally not
identified by name, said the law
"infringes upon fundamental
rights of expression and asso-
ciation which are guaranteed by
the Nigerian Constitution and
by international agreements to
which Nigeria is a party."
The British government last
year threatened to cut aid to
African countries that violate
the rights of gay and lesbian
citizens. However, British aid
remains quite small in oil-rich
Nigeria, one of the top crude

suppliers to the U.S.
Washington-based Human
Rights First urged President
Barack Obama to "consider all
avenues for response," saying
leaders such as Uganda's presi-
dent, Yoweri Museveni, will be
watching.
"This law threatens the very
livelihood of LGBT people and
allies in Nigeria, and sets a dan-
gerous precedent for persecution
and violence against minorities
throughout the region," said the
organization's Shawn Gaylord.
The motivation for the Nige-
rian law is unclear, given that
the country already has one
making homosexual sex ille-
gal. And gay people were not
demanding to be married in a
country where being gay can get
a person lynched by a mob. In
parts of northern Nigeria where
Islamic Shariah law is enforced,
gays and lesbians can be legally
stoned to death.
Some have suggested the new
law in Nigeria and the proposed
one in Uganda are a backlash to
Western pressure to decrimi-
nalize homosexuality. Several
African leaders have warned
they will not be dictated to on a
subject that is anathema to their
culture and religion.
Yahya Jammeh, the president
of Gambia, has said homosexu-
als should be decapitated.
In June, Senegal's president,
Macky Sall, argued with Obama
about the subject at a news con-
ference. Sall told the AP after-
ward that other countries should
refrain from imposing their val-
ues beyond their borders.
"We don't ask the Europeans
to be polygamists," Sall said.
"We like polygamy in our coun-
try, but we can't impose it in
yours. Because the people won't
understand it. They won't accept
it."
Jonathan, Nigeria's president,
has not publicly expressed his
views on homosexuality. But his
spokesman, Reuben Abati, told
the AP on Monday night, "This
is a law that is in line with the
people's cultural and religious
inclination. So it is a law that
is a reflection of the beliefs and
orientation of Nigerian people.
Nigerians are pleased with
it." Abati said he has heard of
no Nigerian demonstrations
against the law.
The few Nigerian gays and
human rights activists who
tried to give evidence last year
during the debate in the House
of Assembly were heckled and
booed until one broke into tears
and another could not be heard.
Nigerians are the least toler-
ant nation when it comes to gays,
with 98 percent surveyed saying
society should not accept homo-
sexuality, according to a study of
39 nations around the world by
the U.S. Pew Research Center.
Under Nigeria's new law, it is
now a crime to have a meeting
of gays, to operate or go to a gay
club, society or organization, or
make any public show of affec-
tion.

Christie's presidential bid faces
uncertainty after 'Bridgegate'

GOP rivals stay
silent as New Jersey
governor flounders
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - As
Democrats intensify their probe
in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Chris-
tie has found little support - and
sharp criticism in some cases -
from the slate of potential rivals
for the Republican presidential
nomination. At the same time,
would-be allies from key states
have been slow to rally behind
the Republican governor, whcse
administration appears to have
created a massive traffic jam to
punish a political adversary.
Some Republican leaders in
Iowa and New Hampshire -
states already gearing up for the
nation's first 2016 presidential
nominating contests - offered
only conditional support for
Christie, acknowledging the
New Jersey investigation is far
from over.
"I think only time will tell
on this," said Bruce Rastetter,
a wealthy Iowa businessman
who led a group of like-minded
Republican donors to New Jer-
sey to encourage a 2012 Chris-
tie presidential run. "And if he

didn't have any knowledge, he
should have a future."
Documents revealed last
week that figures in the Christie
administration may have inten-
tionally caused major backups
near the George Washington
Bridge, linking the community
of Fort Lee to New York City,
to exact political retribution
against a Democratic mayor who
refused to endorse his re-elec-
tion campaign. Christie fired a
top aide and jettisoned his chief
political adviser after internal
communications confirming
their involvement became pub-
lic.
He adamantly denied any
personal "knowledge or involve-
ment" in the lane closures.
Democrats in New Jersey on
Monday formed special legisla-
tive committees with subpoena
power, expanding the traffic-
jam investigation into an abuse
of power probe. But Christie,
who is considering a presidential
bid, is also facing criticism from
his own party - particularly
from other Republicans who are
eyeing the presidency.
The intense scrutiny under-
scores the tremendous political
pressure Christie faces as one of
his party's most popular figures

ahead of the 2016 presidential
contest.
"Nobodylikes the ideaofusing
government against someone
for political reasons," Kentucky
Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who
is examining a 2016 run, said in
an interview with KPNX-TV in
Phoenix. "I think that's what's
being addressed here and that's
why I think it's a bigger issue
than just traffic. Because if it is
true, if it looks like someone who
won an election is punishing
people they beat in the election;
that leaves a really bad taste in
people's mouth."
Former Pennsylvania Sen.
Rick Santorum, weighing a
second presidential candidacy,
complimented Christie on Sun-
day for taking tough questions
but raised new questions about
the governor's staffing decisions.
"The people that you hire
are the policies that are imple-
mented," Santorum said. "It's
very clear that the personnel
there was not sensitive to what
seemed to be a fairly obvious
wrong thing to do."
Other prospective Republican
presidential candidates simply
declined to support Christie
in recent days when given the
opportunity.

T e l
Investing in the future
The state's budgetary surplus is an opportunity to invest in the future
T he state of Michigan can expect a $917 million budget surplus,
according to estimates from the Consensus Revenue Estimating
Conference on January 9th, where the representatives of the State
Treasury and the House and Senate fiscal agencies met to discuss economic
forecasts. As the state continues to recover from the national recession, the
bulk of the surplus should be spent on education funding and tax rebates for
pensioners who were unfairly targeted by recent policy changes. The state
government should also allocate funds for infrastructure, the civil service in

Detroit and renewable energy.
The budget for 2013 amounted to $48.2 bil-
lion, and included the $400 million budget sur-
plus from 2012. While this is the second year
in a row that the state of Michigan has seen a
surplus - 2011 saw a budget deficit that totaled
$1.5 billion - it has certainly come at a cost.
To get there, the state made significant cuts
to education spending for the second year in a
row, despite hinting that a reprieve may come
after the 2012 cuts to per-student allocation for
schools. Gov. Rick Snyder has also cut funding
fromhigher education and should restore fund-
ing to public universities. A plan to aid strug-
gling school districts is also critical, as50 school
districts ended the 2013 fiscal year with budget
deficits. Pension recipientswere also negatively
affected by Snyder's budgetary policies. Both
public and private pensioners saw increased
tax rates from 2011, significantly burdening
their limited, fixed income. These two groups
deserve a share of the budget surplus, especial-
ly as their reasons for needing the money stem
from budget cuts and taxes that were levied by
the state. However, even if education funding is
increased and pensioners receive a tax rebate as
a result of the surplus, Snyder does not deserve
to be lauded as an advocate for education or a
friend to retirees - something that would be
expedient in an election year.
Michigan should take note of other munici-
palities that are trying out innovative ways to
promote education. San Francisco has created
a program that creates a savings account for
every kindergartener, and places a seed of $50
in the account. It then partners with business
to match contributions by friends and family
into the fund. It helps students save for college
starting at a young age, and should be used to
make college more affordable for families with
financial need.
Other priorities for the surplus money
should include infrastructure, renewable

energy and Detroit's civil service to help the
city pay employees and pensions. Michigan's
roads and road clearing systems have proven
inadequate this winter. Major Michigan roads
were not cleared for up to two weeks after the
storm Jan. 4, caused by the polar vortex. Some
roads were cleared quickly, but many remained
icy and snow covered long after storm had
ended, making travel difficult for students
and faculty returning to campus after holi-
day travel. Grants to counties in need to aid in
winter cleanup could help people all over the
state get to work and school, as well as reduce
the dangers of driving on inadequately cleared
or un-cleared roads. Looking to Michigan's
future, investing in renewable energy will help
the state wean itself off of fossil fuels. Wind
energy in particular has become much more
efficient. In 2009, the cost of wind energy
was about $100 per megawatt-hour. This has
since decreased by about half. Furthermore, a
state energy commission report has concluded
that Michigan is on track to meet its require-
ment that 10 percent of electricity come from
renewable sources by 2015, and it will be eco-
nomically viable to increase that standard to 30
percent by 2035. Additional funding from the
state government could provide the necessary
push to make that happen. Finally, some of the
money should be set aside to help Detroit as
it restructures, especially to help it meet pen-
sion obligations and meet its obligations to its
current employees.
Snyder's surplus was created through sac-
rifice by specific constituencies in the state.
Michigan schools and pensioners deserve to be
repaid for their contributions in creating the
surplus in the first place. The rest of surplus
needs to be spent on Michigan's infrastructure
and investing in its future. Educated students
and a clean environment will ensure a promis-
ing future for the state.

fall 2013 edition, the participants
were almost completelymale.
Hackathons are the most awaited
and attended collegiate computer
science events, and the gender
imbalance is almost reflective of the
demographics of the tech industry
as a whole.
From a cool 37.1 percent in 1984, to
less than 12 percent in 2011, the pro-
portion of Computer Science bach-
elor's degrees awarded to women has
taken a nose dive. what shocked me
was that things aren't different here
on campus. U of M is Ranked No. 7 in
the Computer Science and Computer
Science Engineering track in Amer-
ica. Yet, word is that you can count
the number of female students in
middle-level to upper-level Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science
classes on your fingers.
Since most of the students in com-
puter science are male, male students
are able to form a tight community
of friends much faster. Outside of
the classroom, they end up spending
most of their time with each other,
and some even decide to live together
after leaving the dorms. For them,
collaboration begins early on. Inter-
actions don't stop at classrooms and
living spaces; they interact with like-
minded peers - and potential col-
leagues - at hackathons, internships
and even tech startups - all of which
are male-dominated. They're con-
stantly networking, even uninten-
tionally. Knowing the kind of people
they're going to work with makes it
easier for them to find their place in
the industry.
Why is the gender ratio dramati-
cally skewed in the tech industry?
Is it merely a matter of interest? Are
men just naturally more skilled at
coding? History suggests otherwise;
in fact, in the mid-1980s the number
of women majoring in CS and CSE
was increasing.
Those days are gone, and women
like Grace Hopper remain underap-
preciated. Now we hardly ever see
female figures in computer science.
There's the projected stereotype
of a Computer Science major being
a "gamer," "geek" or "nerd." Sadly,
mainstream media doesn't portray
any of these as females.
The more pressing issue, however,
is the lack of mentorship and role
models available to female students.
According to a 2012 report on
the Institutional Indicators of
Diversity for faculty at the Univer-

sity of Michigan - referred to as
the AY2012 report - 23 percent of
all Science, Technology, Engineer-
ing and Mathematics faculty at the
University were female. For Engi-
neering, the figure stands at 16 per-
cent. The dynamics are even more
skewed at the highest rank for full
professors in STEM, where only 17
percent were females.
Although I, too, can walk up to
professors with questions regarding
course selections, where to apply for
internships, etc., my male counter-
parts usually have more people they
can easily approach. I know that's
not a good excuse, but seeing some-
one similar to you makes them more
approachable; it's easier to have con-
versations with them. With so few
female instructors in the introduc-
tory courses, female CS majors are
deemed as different right from the
beginning of their college careers.
As a college campus with an amazing
reputation for computer science, the
University should have a more inclu-
sive and diverse faculty.
There are definitely efforts being
made by female students to make CS
and CSE more inviting for under-
graduate females. Student organiza-
tions such as Girls in EECS, Women
in Science and Engineering and Soci-
ety of Women Engineers, manage to
receive funding and regularly hold
events for students to interact with
each other, as well as with poten-
tial employers. However, for what-
ever reasons, participation remains
extremely low and their efforts
largely remain unheard of.
Male students, on the other hand,
can't comprehend what stops women
from being an active presence in the
tech community on campus. When
I attended one of the core meetings
of Michigan Hackers at the start
of fall 2013, I was the only female.
"Yeah, right now we're pretty much
a boys club. I don't understand why
can't girls just join Michigan Hack-
ers," said one of the social chairs of
the organization when I asked what
he thought of the gender dynam-
ics in the room. When I inquired if
they had made any efforts to con-
tact gEECS or WISE, he said the
team hadn't thought of that. "I just
focus on promotion of tech talks and
other events that we host." Michi-
gan Hackers, along with MPowered,
organizes MHacks.
For CSE junior Natasja Nielsen, an
active member of MPowered Entre-
preneurship, it has always been about
taking action. "Being a woman in CS
isn't easy, but eventually you've got to
ignore the sexist side of it and tough-
en up. There is no difference between
female and male hackers, and that is
why I decided not to join any gender-
specific tech student orgs. I think it is
necessary for every student to devel-
op their own support system, and
having both male and female friends
in and outside of my major has helped
me a lot."
CS sophomore Anna Rode said
it's necessary for girls in CS classes
to be able to regularly interact with

their male counterparts. "Person-
ally, it has always been easier for
me to be friends with guys, so the
gender imbalance didn't personally
bother me much. But if you want
to be able to comfortably work in
the tech industry, you have got to
find those people who will be sup-
portive and cut out those who treat
you different."
Both Neilson and Rode think that
it is extremely important for girls to
find support among male students,
since they form the majority of their
peers. However, the CS student orga-
nizations almost mirror the situa-
tion in classrooms - as if there is an
almost invisible line separating girls
from the good old boys club.
Not surprisingly, the decline
in the numbers start right from
high school According to the Col-
lege Board in 2013, a total of 5,485
girls and 24,070 boys took the AP
Computer Science exams. Colleges
need to encourage participation of
females in tech-related concentra-
tions. Ever since Carnegie Mellon
University started hosting programs
to bridge this gender gap in 1995, the
number of female CS undergradu-
ates rose from 7 percent in 1995 to
30 percent in 2004. These programs
included reaching out to high school
students and efforts towards chang-
ing the peer culture on campus.
Andrew DeOrio, a Computer
Science Engineering professor
said he wants all his students to
feel supported. "Regardless of
what social, cultural, or gender
demographic a student fits in, they
should feel supported, and I would
definitely encourage any endeavor
to make CS classrooms on campus
more diverse."
But the question remains: Who
should be taking action? Should stu-
dents take the initiative first, and
work on programs like those at Carn-
egie Mellon themselves? Or is the
administration responsible?
Right now, italmostseems as if the
administration is blatantly ignoring
this gender disparity. Even if they
were making efforts, they aren't
doing a good job of making them
known. It is essential that incom-
ing freshman females be supported;
acknowledgement by the adminis-
tration shows that they are willing to
put in work to bridge this gender gap.
I have only mentioned figures
and opinions concerning the gender
binary. Diversity as a whole in com-
puter science is a story for another
time. With the dependence on tech-
nology increasing by the hour and its
influence on culture exponentially
rising, dictation of terms in the tech
industry by a single, like-minded
majority isn't, to say the least, fair.
As MHacks looks to its winter 2014
iteration this weekend, it's time the
University administration and stu-
dent body started making efforts to
live up to their reputation in the tech
community.

ALLISON RAECK I
The 'Rundown' Languages Bldg.

Thirty minutes after the hour, nestled in the
basement of the Modern Languages Building,
my French class glanced from the clock to
the door, bewildered as to the whereabouts
of our professor. Like a herd of lost sheep,
we anticipated her arrival in echoing silence.
At precisely 12:35 p.m., our professor made a
grand entrance, proclaiming, "Excusez-moi,
j'etais coinced dans '616vateur!"
"Excuse me, I was trapped in the elevator."
Tosomethismayseemlike atraumatic, rare
occurrence. But to us MLB regulars, getting
stuck in the elevator is a casual rite of passage.
I remember my first time being trapped in the
MLB elevator like it was yesterday, mainly
because it was yesterday. On the way to my
professor's office hours, I was naive enough to
pass up the stairs and board the University's
very own Tower of Terror only to come to a
jerky halt somewhere between the third and
fourth floors. On my way out of the contraption,
after thanking the maintenance worker and
kissing the seemingly stable floor beneath my
feet, I came to a dramatic realization: nobody
should ever have to endure the nightmare that
is the MLB.
As if LSA's foreign language requirement
isn't inconvenient enough, the University has
its students learnthese languages in a building
reminiscent of the set of "Saved by the Bell."
Its basement, home of many failed conjugation
quizzes and a few lost hopes and dreams, sets
the foundation for a building which, contrary
to what its title may suggest, is anything
but modern. Though the University's 2011
financial report states that renovation for the
basement and second floor of the MLB started
three years ago, the basement continues to look
like something from 50 years ago. Students are
shoved into tiny classrooms with desks I have
not experienced since my elementary school's
field trip to a one-room schoolhouse. I am
still waiting for someone to explain why the
writing space of these desks is not big enough
for a piece of paper. The white, brick walls
symbolize the emptiness of the building's

soul, with abandoned lockers and blackboards
adding a nice, vintage touch. Everyone knows
that the MLB is the "Throwback Thursday"
of University buildings, paying homage to the
dismal, underfunded days of high school.
While I realize that one's ability to learn
is not fully dependent on the interior design
of his or her classroom, I have experienced
unrest in the basement's classrooms that have
inhibited my ability to focus. Snuggled elbow-
to-elbow with two of my classmates every
day, I sometimes question my life choices
when coming to class. Though my minor
case of claustrophobia has only caused me to
dramatically exit the room on one occasion,
I can't help but wonder how the MLB
basement experience is for other students at
the University. Its seating is problematic for
people who physically cannot use the wrap-
around desks, and the elevator is a necessary
risk for those relying on its accessibility.
Small desks have even been shown to cause
back pain, especially among tall students. For
the most part, most other buildings at the
University accommodate those with special
needs. Still, the MLB remains stagnant,
showing very little alterations since its
construction in 1965.
While a repair for the building's elevator
is scheduled to take place this June, the MLB
needs to see many other changes as well.
The University prides itself on being at the
pinnacle of academic excellence, supplying
its students with what they need to succeed.
But what Michigan students need isn't a
$4.4 million fishbowl redesign or a $4 billion
fundraiser. What they need is a place to learn
without getting stuck in a desk, elevator or
overcrowded hallway. A crudely graffittied
quote in one of the MLB's women's bathrooms
says it all: "I hate this f***ing place." Let's get
with the times, spend our money, responsibly
and give students a reason to come to class.
Let's renovate the MLB, already.

Themir foptions

Birth. It's not a topic that many
college studentsstress over. Ifwe do,
it's probably because we're stressing
to avoid it, right? But for those of you
(I'm talking to my male peers, too)
who have thought about becom-
ing a parent, have you ever actually
considered how you, or your part-
ner would give birth? It may seem
like a ridiculous question, but why?
Most of us explored other colleges
and universities before deciding to
attend the University of Michigan.
A number of us won't choose our
major until after our expected grad-
uation date - hello, fifth year. And,
let's not get started on the countless
hours we've all wasted scouring the
Course Guide for that perfect three
credit, Tuesday/Thursday, after-
noon-but-before-4 p.m. elective.
We dedicate our valuable time to
researching options before making
even the most trivial of decisions.
So why don't we spend a comparable
amount of time exploring our birth-
ing options? You're only bringing a
kid into the world.
Take the time to think about it.
If you or your partner were to have
a child someday, what would your
child's birth look like? The experi-
ence most of us picture is an ago-

nized mother laboring on her back
in a hospital bed, too many painful
hours later a doctor decides to end
the misery with drugs and push-
ing or drugs and a C-section. An
image like this comes as no surprise
because it reflects the reality of a
typical American birth. The Center
for Disease Control and Preven-
tion reported that 98.7 percent of
all births in 2011 were delivered in
a hospital, and of this overwhelm-
ing majority, 86.1 percent were
attended by doctors. It's no wonder
we don't spend time thinking about
birth. Our overall perception of the
process is negative. There is good
news, though. Childbirth does not
have to be a feared or negative expe-
rience. This common perception
is just that, a perception. Despite
their rarity, there are other birth-
ing views and options out there that
are just as safe and definitely worth
your exploration.
If you want children someday, you
will truly be doing your future self a
favor if you take the time to research
childbirth. While a home birth with
a professional midwife and doula
might be the ideal birthing experi-
ence for one individual, a delivery
in a birthing center with a certified

nurse midwife may sound appealing
to another. A laboring mother may
choose to manage her pain with pres-
sure point massage therapy, but a dif-
ferent woman could prefer the pain
relief that a warm bath can provide.
These birth scenarios may sound for-
eign to you, but that's exactly why you
should do some research for yourself.
There are many options available to
us in order to uniquely shape our own
experiences with childbirth. In the
end, the power you will gain when
you know you've made an informed
decision will become more valuable
than the options themselves. Wheth-
er you choose to enjoy the birth of
your child in your home, in a birthing
center or at the hospital in the com-
pany of doctors, nurses, midwives
or doulas, do so with the knowledge
that you consciously chose your
experience. We often overlook a par-
ent's experience with birth in order
to ensure the safety of a new life,
but one does not have to come at the
expense of the other. Childbirth can
be a positive and empowering expe-
rience if you just take the time to
research the options that will bebest
for your or your partner.

Pollack also detailed the
ongoing creation of four faculty
committees designed to address
various aspects of the Univer-
sity that need development. The
tentative titles of these commit-
tees are Diversity Equity and
Inclusion, Having Faculty in the
21st century, Financial Mod-
els for Higher Education and
Engaged Learning and Digital
Instruction.
Additionally, searches for
new deans of the School of Lit-
erature, Science, and the Arts
and the School of Pharmacy are
still underway.
Initial interviews for both
schools have been completed
and the second round of selec-
tion is underway. There are
three internal candidates for the
position and between two and
four external candidates.
Astronomy Prof. Sally Oey, a
SACUA member, inquired about
specific characteristics the Uni-
versity was seeking in the new
LSA dean. Pollack said the Uni-
versity is looking for someone
committed to enhaneing the
value of a liberal arts education.
"'We are looking for an excel-
lent academic with a strong
academic record, good admin-
istrative and management expe-
rience," Pollack said. "They
should be very collaborative,
have very good ethical values."
Pollack said the search to
replace Lester Monts, senior
vice provost for academic
affairs, as well as Christina
Whitman, vice provost for aca-
demic and faculty affairs, will
also begin soon.


FUEL-EEICIENT

considered to calculate the aver-
age energy intensity of airplanes,
whereas all "light-duty" vehicles
- cars, SUVs, pickups and vans -
were considered to calculate that
of cars.
Sivak observed that between
1970 and 2010, air carriers collec-
tively reduced their energy inten-
sities by 74 percent, whereas the
improvement for driving was only
a 17 percent bump. In 2010, the
energy used for driving surpassed

that of flying by 57 percent.
Sivak- also' addressed electric
cars in his report, adding that
their limited prolificacy - less
than 1 percent of all vehicles on
the road - made them unneces-
sary to include in his calculation
of light-duty vehicle energy out-
put.
He also wrote that without any
improvement in fuel economy, an
increase in average vehicle load
from 1.38 to 2.3 persons would
match the energy intensity of
driving and flying.
"The fuel economyofthe entire
fleet of light-duty vehicles would

have to improve from the cur-
rent 21.5 miles per gallon to at
least 33.8 miles per gallon," Sivak
wrote.
However, neither of these
changes will be easy to imple-
ment. Even as new technology
yields better fuel economy for
light-duty vehicles, their intro-
duction into the current fleet of
cars in use will have a marginal
effect on the total energy inten-
sity produced by driving.
However, the number of pas-
sengers on an average trip has
decreased in recent years -
increasing the per capita energy

intensity of each trip. The down-
ward trend ih vehicle'load'meanris
the 67 percent load increase need-
ed to reduce energy intensity may
not be a realistic expectation.
"It is important to recognize
that the energy intensity of flying
will continue to improve," Sivak
said. "Consequently, because the
future energy intensity of flying
will be better than it currently is,
the (suggested) improvements ...
underestimate the improvements
that need to be achieved for driv-
ing to be less energy intensive
than flying."


CARDIAC
From Page 1
an observational study tracking
Medicare information from 2007
to 2008, which revealed the cor-
relation outlined in their study.
However, the researchers cau-
tioned that some of the disparity
remains unexplained.
"Other studies have looked at
the racial disparities and have
tried to explain them by pointing
to differences in the patient popu-
lation - that nonwhite patients
tend to be sicker or have more
medical comorbidities, and that
affects their outcomes," Rangrass
said. "Or they could have a lower
socioeconomic background,
lower education levels. One thing
that hadn't been looked at was
where they went for care."
The study followed over
173,000 patients in the Medicare
database who underwent coro-
nary artery bypass graft surgery.
About eight percent of the study
population was nonwhite. Results

indicated that nonwhite patients
had a 33 percent higher mortal-
ity rate post-surgery than whites,
bearing out previously estab-
lished differences.
Carmen Green, UMHS associ-
ate vice president and associate
dean for health equity and inclu-
sion, said the broad impact of
inequalities like these could be
quite expensive.
The social cost of healthcare
inequalities - the cost hospitals
must incur due to sicker popula-
tions and lost productivity - is
estimated at about $1.2 trillion,
according to a report from Johns
Hopkins University.
In examining the link to hos-
pital quality, the study found that
the mortality rates in hospitals
that treated the most nonwhite
patients had the highest mortal-
ity rates of all hospitals included
in the study - regardless of the
race of individual patients being
treated.
To improve care, Rangrass said
hospitals that treat large com-
munities of nonwhite patients
need to be looked at more closely,

which might be difficult in com-
ing years since a mandate in the
Affordable Care Act that penal-
izes underperforming hospitals.
"It's kind of like a reverse Robin
Hood effect, where now we're
going to be penalizing those hos-
pitals that actually need the most
amount of resources," he said.
"These are hospitals that have
lower access to tech - they are
underfunded, under resourced,
they may also be lower volume
centers for care, and so diverting
resources from those underper-
forming centers, specifically plac-
es who treat larger percentages
of nonwhite patients, is actually
going to worsen the racial dispar-
ity."
The study still leaves some
questions unanswered and raised
some new ones. Independently,
hospital quality explained only 35
percent of the racial differences
in mortality rates. When the data
was adjusted for patient factors
and socioeconomic status in addi-
tion to hospital quality, research-
ers were able to explain 53 percent
of the racial disparities.

The study's authors said this
research is just the first step in
exploring why the inequalities in
mortality rate between white and
nonwhite patients exist. Factors
listed as potential causes for the
remaining unexplained differ-
ences include regional variations
in hospital quality, proximity to
high-quality hospitals and segre-
gated referral patterns.
For Green, the UMHS vice
president, the real world implica-
tions of data like this is something
that should first be considered
on the internal level. Green cau-
tioned that she viewed this study
more as preliminary research
rather than conclusive results
because of the many factors that
can contribute to the inequalities.
"A person like me, who's in my
position, would say 'Hmm. Let's
take a look at ourselves,"' Green
said. "Let's look at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. How do we
think about this? At our cardio-
vascular center, how do we think
about making certain that one, we
always put patients and family
first?"

several days in December with

There are fears the protest-
ers are trying to incite violence
to prompt the military to inter-
vene, and Yingluck has dealt
softly with the demonstrators in
a bid to keep the situation calm.
There was no effort by police to
stop Monday's seizure of major
traffic intersections.
The country's powerful army
commander has repeatedly said
he wants to stay out of the con-
flict, but in a sign of apparent
impatience late last month, he
refused to rule out the possibil-
ity of a military takeover.
The real target of the protest-
ers' wrath is Yingluck's brother,
former Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra, who lives in self-
imposed exile to avoid jail time
for a corruption conviction but
still wields considerable sway
over Thai politics. They accuse
Yingluck of being Thaksin's
puppet, but the rural poor like
him for the populist policies he
implemented, including virtu-
ally free health care.
"I'm here to get rid of Thaksin
and his cronies," said Darunee
Suredechakul, a 49-year-old
Bangkok native and resort
owner who is staying in a hotel
so she and her daughter can
join the protests. "The govern-
ment has to go. Reforms must
be carried out. This is mainly
because we don't want to see the
same old corrupted politicians
returning to power over and
over again."
While she acknowledged the
street blockades must be creat-
ing some headaches for people,
"Bangkok residents must be
patient until we move past this
point so that our children will
not have to suffer like we do.
Trust me. It's worth it," she said.
Most Thai and international
schools in Bangkok were closed
Monday, as was at least one
major shopping mall.
Enterprising residents set up
makeshift booths to sell drinks,
skewers of chicken and bowls of
noodles, while others hawked
whistles, caps and T-shirts.

in Cairo, Egypt, Monday.
Egyptian mi litary oversees
referendum ongav. charter

Opposing party
members arrested
for protesting
campaign efforts
CAIRO (AP) - Egyptians are
being asked to vote this week on
a vision of their nation's future
sponsored by the powerful mili-
tary, a two-day election widely
seen as a referendum on a likely
presidential run by the country's
top general - but held in a cli-
mate of fear and intimidation.
An astounding 160,000 sol-
diers and 200,000 policemen
were expected to deploy across
Egypt on Tuesday and Wednes-
day to guard polling stations
and voters following months of
violence that authorities have
blamed on Islamic militants.
Supporters of Mohammed
Morsi, the Islamist president
ousted in a coup last summer,
have said they would stage mas-
sive demonstrations and boycott
the vote on a new constitution.
In many ways, Egypt looks
more like a country going to war
rather than one preparing for
what is supposedly a transition
to democratic rule. The govern-
ment and the overwhelmingly
pro-military media have por-
trayed the balloting as the key to

the nation's security and stabil-
ity over which there can be no
dissent.
Hundreds of thousands of
fliers, posters, banners and bill-
boards exhort Egyptians to vote
"yes." Posters urging a 'no' vote
have led to arrests.
"There appears to be a con-
viction among security officers
that there should be zero accom-
modation for anyone who wants
a 'no' vote," said Heba Morayef,
the Egypt director for Human
Rights Watch.
Authorities have threatened
legal proceedings against the
owners of cyber cafes, presses
and stationery stores if they
allow use of their facilities for
the production of 'no' fliers
or posters, according to secu-
rity officials. They said police
commanders have instructed
officers to arrest anyone distrib-
utingleaflets or hanging banners
against the draft charter. The
officials spoke on condition of
anonymity in exchange for dis-
cussing security operations.
"We are trying to mobilize
the 'yes' vote. Anyone doing
the opposite is a traitor and an
American agent," said Moham-
med Hamdy, a politician and
local dignitary from the city of
Assiut, an Islamist stronghold
with a large Christian commu-
nity south of Cairo.

In Washington, U.S. State
Department deputy spokes-
woman Marie Harf said Mon-
day: "We're deeply concerned
by reports of ongoing arrests for
campaigning for a 'no' vote on
the constitutional referendum.
We are also deeply troubled by
reports that at least one indi-
vidual was beaten during his
arrest."
The referendum is the sixth
nationwide vote since the 2011
ouster of longtime authoritar-
ian ruler Hosni Mubarak, with
the five others possibly the fre-
est ever seen in Egypt. While
unlikely to be stained by fraud,
this week's vote is taking place
at a time when many of the free-
doms won in the uprising that
toppled Mubarak have vanished
in the months since Morsi was
removed after just one year in
office.
The government has detained
thousands of Brotherhood mem-
bers including Morsi and most
of the group's leaders. Recently,
the notorious domestic security
agency set up hotlines for citi-
zens to report members of the
Brotherhood, which the gov-
ernment has declared a terror-
ist group. For their part, Morsi's
supporters have been waging
-near-daily protests since the
popularly backed July 3 coup
that ousted him.

everyone in the Charleston
metropolitan area is cleared to

said the water in certain des-
ignated areas was safe to drink
and wash with as long as people
flushed out their systems. They
cautioned that the water may
still have a slight licorice-type
odor to it, raising the anxieties
of some who believed it was still
contaminated.
"I'm not going to drink it. I'll
shower in it and do dishes in it.
But I won't drink it. I don't think
it's (the chemical) all out," said
Angela Stone, who started the
30-minute or so process of flush-
ing her system out soon after the
ban was lifted.
By Monday evening, officials
had given the green light to
about 15 percent of West Vir-
ginia American Water's custom-
ers, and company spokeswoman
Laura Jordan said as much as
25 percent of its customer base
could have water by the end of
the day.
The water crisis shuttered

showed a very small portion in
blue and a vast area across nine
counties still in the 'do not use'
red.
Customers were credited with
1,000 gallons of water, which
was likely more than enough to
flush out a system. The average
residential customer uses about
3,300 gallons per month.
Some people said they weren't
worried about the odor.
"It's not goingto bother me as
long as we know it's clean," said
Peter Triplett, a state library
commission worker whose home
was near the first area allowed
to use water. "It's been rough
going."
The first area cleared was
downtown Charleston, the state
capital and its largest city. Hos-
pitals were open and flushing
out systems, but schools were to
stay closed Tuesday.
The water crisis started
Thursday when a chemical used
in coal processing leaked from
a Freedom Industries plant into
the nearby Elk River.

It's time to award credit
where credit is due.
In one and a half seasons,
Kim Barnes Arico has turned
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team into a competitor.
This season in particular, the
Wolverines are over-performing
because of their second-year
coach.
Last year,
Barnes Arico
led Michigan
to its best
season ever,
but it's easy
to dismiss
it from her
ALEXA resume
DE XA because of
DETTELBACH the strong
batch of
seniors she
inherited. But whether or not
you appreciate what the coach
did last season, it's hard to argue
with her early results in 2013-14.
She returned only one starter
and 16 percent of her offense
from last year, setting the stage
for a slow transition year. But
her squad has come out shooting
on all cylinders.

struggle
program history, ranked No.18
by Prospects Nation. It includes
four players in the top 20,
according to ESPN's HoopGurlz.
The future Wolverines's
commitment to their coach says
a lot about Barnes Arico, but her
game time demeanor also proves
illuminating.
She's very emotional and it
shows from the opening tip.
She starts most games seated
on the bench next to her team,
one hand in a fist with the other
wrapped around it. When she's
satisfied, her hands relax. She
almost always starts with a
sweater on, but it's usually on
the back of her chair by the first
timeout.
Barnes Arico stands when
she's frustrated or trying to get
someone's attention. She also
stands when Michigan makes a
good play on defense. Offensive
plays don't get the same
excitement, but that's probably
because she expects them.
The second-year coach is a
talker, and she jaws on the side-
lines to her team and assistant
coaches. And while Barnes Arico
has a naturally soft voice that
easily grows hoarse, her yells
during the game can be heard
from the upper level. She's pas-
sionate and confident, and that
spreads to her team.
After a loss, she's more
deflated than angry. But when
the Wolverines win, she's the
happiest person in the room,
and there's always a bounce in
her step.
Michigan has come a long way
in the short time since Barnes
Arico took over, and in that time,
the maize and blue has become
just as important to her.
It's hard to know where
this Michigan team would be
without Barnes Arico, but it
wouldn't be here.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Michigan women's basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico has brought the program back to national prominence and narrowed a long-standing gap with the Spartans.

Avery undersized Michigan
team currently sits first in the
Big Ten at rebounding margin,
at plus-9.7 per game.
Oh, and the team is 11-5.
It's a testament to Barnes
Arico's coaching job that her
team has overcome its size
disadvantage. From day one, the
Wolverines have embraced her
coaching style and her vision.
Since taking over in Ann Arbor,
Barnes Arico has posted a 33-16
record, including a 22-win
season lastyear, which tied the
program best.
Her moniker for the squad
is, "hardest working team
in America," and it's hard to
argue with that considering its
ability to play smart, aggressive
basketball. And that starts with
Barnes Arico.
Despite the Wolverines
falling to Michigan State on
Sunday, Barnes Arico's team
outrebounded the Spartans for
the first time since 2002. And

last season, her squad snagged
a win over Michigan State,
something her predecessors
hadn't done in 12 tries.
But more than just wins and
losses is her impact on individu-
al production. Last season, then-
senior forward Kate Thompson

prepared and even refers to Ohio
State as "Ohio" - and she wins.
She gets the best from her
players and that's been apparent
this season. Junior forward
Cyesha Goree lost weight,
improved her physicality
and, under

exploded onto
the scene with
her 3-point
shot and
often credited
Barnes Arico
for her looks.
The coach also
helped guide
Jenny Ryan as

point guard
and developed

like," Goree said. "She keeps
pushing me, because there are
a lot of things I need to work
on. overall, she's helping me
become a better player and
person inside and out."
Barnes Arico has helped ease
the transition for junior-transfer
guard Shannon Smith and has
guided Smith to a career season,
including a 32-point perfor-
mance against Detroit Mercy.
And once the team got its
sea legs, Barnes Arico tinkered
with the lineup, moving players
around to find the best starting
five and developing freshman
point guard Siera Thompson and
senior center Val Driscoll into
starters. Thompson in particular
has grown significantly under
Barnes Arico's coaching.
In addition to coaching,
Barnes Arico has strengthened
the Michigan brand on the
recruiting trail. Last month, she
signed arguably the best class in

a strong bond with the rest
of the 2012-13 seniors as they
helped her get acclimated to the
University and the Michigan
culture.

Swecomes Penn State

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
Penn State men's basketball
coach Pat Chambers has seen it
all. He's had a successful career
as a businessman, made a Final
Four as an
assistant, BEH
revived a
stagnant LNLMY
Boston LNES
University
program
and even
survived a near-fatal stabbing.
But perhaps no obstacle he
has encountered can match the
challenge he currently faces in
Happy Valley. Currently in his
third season, his team is a com-
bined 6-34 in Big Ten play. Yet
the biggest win of his tenure
came over then-No. 4 Michigan
last February - one of the sea-
son's two conference wins.
A spirited Chambers sat down
with the Daily at October's Big
Ten Media Day.
The Michigan Daily: Your
win over Michigan last year was
a big deal for your program. Can
a win like that help push the
program forward?
Pat Chambers: First of all, I
think we helped Michigan. By
beating them, I think we helped
them. They came together and
they went on a run of runs - it

was just amazing and (Michigan
coach) John Beilein's a good
friend. He and I talk all the
time, so I've got great respect
for Michigan. It can help our
program, yes, but we can't put
ourselves in that position every
year, or I'm not going to be
around much longer, you know?
We need to start winning games
consistently and competing at
a higher level and bringing in
the right talent that can put
ourselves in position to make
some postseason play.
TMD: Last year, you nearly
beat the Wolverines twice. What
about Michigan is it with you?
Do you have things figured out,
maybe even going back to facing
Beilein in the Big East when you
were an assistant at Villanova?
PC: I have nothing figured
out. (Laughter.) Sometimes we
get too much credit as coaches.
... To go on the road at Penn
State, and we're 0-14, maybe
they weren't as up for the game.
Human nature sets in. I don't
know if we have them figured
out, but we did play them well. I
feel like we've played them well
the last couple of years and I
can't tell you why.
TMD: It wasn't long ag'o that
Michigan was finishing at the
bottom of the conference. To see
them rise so quickly, is that pro-

gram something you look at as a
model for building Penn State?
PC: I do. I look at Michigan;
I look at Wisconsin when they
were a little down before Bo
(Ryan) got into the league. It
can be done. People say, 'How
are you going to do it? How are
you going to do it? The league is
brutal.' It can be done. Coaches
have done it. John Beilein has
done it; Bo Ryan has done it. I'm
sure I'm missing some of these
other coaches that have done it.
TMD: Last year, you talked
abouthowhavingagood football
program can complement a
basketball program and help
it out in a lot of different ways.
How much can that boost your
program's recruiting?
PC: It definitely helps because
I'm bringing recruits to the
game and they can see the pride
and passion that Penn State
and Penn Staters have for their
athletics. If you were at the
white out against Michigan, or
watched it on TV, it was the most
electric, loud, amazing event -
I'm 42 - that I've ever been to
in my entire life. That's how loud
it was. I don't know if you guys
can say it because you have the
Big House, but it definitely rivals
Michigan - it's just incredible.
That type of atmosphere, that
type of event can only help you
in recruiting.

"I've been TV:Big Ten

time for this
game," said sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III.
Tuesday night serves the
Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 11-4
overall) a chance to avenge their
shocking loss at the hands of
Penn State last year. Michigan,
No. 4 in the nation at the time,
squandered a late lead to give the
Nittany Lions, previously 0-14
in the conference, their first Big
Ten win. It was the Wolverines's
fourth loss in their previous
seven games, and from the looks
of it, was bound to send Michigan
into a complete tailspin.
That's why Robinson recalls

that game in such an interesting
light.
"I definitely remember that
game," he said. "We learned a
lot as a team. I think that was a
changing point for our season,
but it was a tough one to swallow
for us."
Calling them a "very, very hun-
gry Penn State team," Beilein's
compliments were more than just
coach speak. After a rough start
to the Big Ten season that saw
blowout losses to Michigan State
and Illinois, the Nittany Lions
(0-4, 9-8) showed promise in
back-to-back three-point losses
to Minnesota and Indiana.
Their backcourt, featuring
upperclassmen DJ Newbill and
preseason All-Big Ten point
guard Tim Frazier, is "one of the
better backcourts in the nation,"
according to Beilein.
Newbill, at 17.3 points per
game, and Frazier, at 16.6 points
per game, are both top-10 scor-
ers in the conference. The well-
rounded Frazier, who missed all
of last season with a ruptured
Achilles tendon, also averages 6.5
assists and1.7 steals per game.
But the Wolverines can't divert
all of their attention to the Penn
State backcourt. Forward Ross
Travis, who averages 11.2 points
and 8.3 rebounds per game,
recorded double-doubles in each
of his three games against Michi-

gan lastyear.
While Michigan's talent has
the potential to overwhelm the
Nittany Lions, Beilein said he
continually reinforces that no Big
Ten game is ever a guaranteed
win, which is why he's confident
that the Wolverines won't
overlook anything on Tuesday.
"I don't know that we did
that last year - we just did not
execute," Beilein said. "If they
beat us, it won't be because we
looked past them."
Robinson will look to continue
a streak of strong offensive
showings that are finally living
up to the lofty expectations that
accompanied him to Ann Arbor.
The sophomore hasscored atleast
17 points in three of Michigan's
five games since sophomore
forward Mitch McGary was lost
for the season, and is shooting
an efficient 58.5 percent from the
field in that stretch.
Robinson attributes his recent
success to a conversation he had
two weeks ago with his high-
school coach, Dave Milausnic.
"He said, 'It doesn't look like
you'rehavingmuch funoutthere.
Just try to smile more and see if
that helps,' " Robinson said. "I'm
just trying to have fun out there,
and I think that's when Iplay my
best basketball.
"I have a lot of confidence
going right now."

Flailing ABC: the new NBC

PIVOT

Joseph Gordon-Lovin it,
Gordon-Levitt
creates a 'Hit'

Variety show puts
authentic spin on
reality TV
By GRACE HAMILTON
Daily Arts-Writer
Joseph Gordon-Levitt's new
variety show, "HitRecord on TV,"
challenges the conventions and
structure of
popular tele-
vision today -
and promises HitRecord
a season full of
pleasant sur- 011 TV
prises, laughs
and possibly Pivot
some confus- Saturdayat10 p.m.
ing graphics
sequences.
The first episode is set to premiere
on Saturday, Jan. 18 on the Pivot
network but is already available
online. Gordon-Levitt offers much
of the same quirkiness that audi-
ences have come to love in his
acting, which offers a far more
revealing portrait of him in the
role of artist, as well as entrepre-
neur.
Gordon-Levitt founded HitRe-
cord with his brother in 2005. In
2010, it was launched as an open,
collaborative production company,
meaning anyone is free to con-
tribute on a given project, which
includes short films, music and

books. The TV show is an exten-
sionofHitRecord'sonline presence
and provides a more structured
platform for the projects.
Each episode will be guided
by a specific theme - in the pre-
miere episode, it's "The Number
One." The broad and abstract idea
is explored in an equally abstract
way, including clips of inter-
views with people discussing first
impressions and first times, mus-
ings on the number one itself and
Gordon-Levitt's own personal
commentary. His additions are
sincere and there is no option but
to like him - regardless of your
feelings about the show. Much of
his commentary is given through
talking into a hand-held camera,
giving the show a close, intirmate
ethos.
The episode is like an extreme-
ly crafty homemade video, held
together by an over-arching con-
ceptrather than anepisodic narra-
tive arch. The 22-minute length is
perfectly appropriate.
What is particularly special
is that the episode reveals the
enormous complexity building a
project from thousands of con-
tributors. Credit is given where it
is due; to the actors, visual artists,
musicians and the faces of the nor-
mal people whose ideas inspire the
themes and messages of the show
in the first place. For example, the
audience meets Roswell Gray, a
site contributor whose story about

the first time she saw stars was
adapted into a short film, starring
Elle Fanning and James Patrick
Stuart - oh, and contributions
from another 1440 people.
The result is thoughtful and
elegant. There are corny moments,
but they maintain tastefulness
and a sense of aesthetic beauty.
The episode contains two other
films put together in the same
fashion, with topics ranging from
the Pando Forest to songs about
loneliness. Each collaboration has
an entirely different approach and
style, demonstrating the nearly
unlimited range of possibilities
available for episodes ahead.
This show is an ambitious proj-
ect to bring to TV. The viewing
experience is fun and thought-
provoking, in many ways more
similar to perusing a museum or
listening to a podcast than watch-
ing a TVshow. The interesting aes-
thetic provides the show with its
charm; however, it may not fit well
into any of the pop culture themes
that dominate most successful TV
programs today. It is likely the gen-
eral audience may not understand
its charm, or if they do, consider it
reason enough tokeep watching.
Nonetheless, the show is a tes-
tament to the power of new media
age and the internet's ability to
bring together the talent of people
across the world. The product is
well-executed, entertaining and
most importantly, different.

For years, NBC was the butt
of every joke about broadcast
television. Failed programming
and questionable decisions kept
the once-venerable Peacock
in fourth place for years. And
while NBC isn't out of the woods
yet, it has been the number one
network for the past two fall
seasons. Conversely, ABC has
quietly been on a years-long
downward spiral, begging the
question: is ABC the new NBC?
ABC chief Paul Lee
approached this television sea-
son with an interesting strategy.
In a bid to mimic the success of
cable series, most notably "The
Walking Dead," the Alphabet
Network planned to break up the
seasons of a number of its most
successful programs: two batch-
es of 12 episodes to air in the fall
and the spring, with miniseries,
reality shows and event pro-
gramming to bridge the winter
gap. By only the second week of
January, however, it's looking
less and less likely that ABC's
gamble is going to pay off.
With many of its signature
programs, including "Once Upon
a Time," off the air from Decem-
ber to March, alot of pressure is
being put on its new crop of win-
ter series, and the initial results
have been extremely disconcert-
ing.
While ABC's strategy was
certainly innovative - reaping
the benefits of airing its flagship
series uninterrupted and sam-
pling more series in the process
- it has simply taken ABC out
of the television game for the
winter. Even repeats of "Grey's
Anatomy" and "Scandal" would
bring in more viewers than the
new Thursday night lineup, con-
sisting of the low-rated "The
Taste" and "The Assets," which
posted one of the lowest debuts
in the history of broadcast tele-
vision and was pulled after just
two episodes.
Unfortunately, ABC's troubles
go far beyond its scheduling mis-
steps. The network hasn't been
able to launch successful shows
for some time now. Whereas

LITERATURE NOTEBOOK
A fan's case for the classics

By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
Senior Arts Editor
For many students, it seems
that their major is simply ameans
by which to do something - and
maybe not much more than a job.
Many biology majors plan on
attending medical school, many
Ross students want to enter the
business world, and so on and
so forth to the point that you
can almost predict someone's
career based on what they study.
But classics? Studying Ancient
Greek and Latin? Why the hell
would you want to do that? I'm
a Comparative Literature major,
and much of the subject's course
material involves the classics.
I often get asked why I study
them, and to be honest, have
even asked myself the same
question. Well, I've come up
with an answer; I study classics
because I like them.
I'll start by addressing some
of the "practical" reasons that
are given for studying classics.
First, my absolute favorite; the
old "study Latin if you want to
be a doctor because so many
medical terms are Latin," dic-
tum. I've never understood the
logic behind this, yet it seems to

to study Latin. All I'll say is that
this makes as much sense as tell-

Spanish before atrip to Chipotle.
Then, there is the slightly
more tolerable idea that studying
Greek and Latin helps your ana-
lytical skills. Unlike the former,
this is actually true; taking a
sentence from Plato's Apology of
Socrates and keeping track of the

At their core, art museums are
largely impersonal. Unless a visi-
tor feels particularly connected
to a piece of artwork, it'svery easy
to feel disconnected - and over-
whelmed by the vast collection of
paintings and sculptures that line
the walls. But what happens when
the visitor becomes the art?
The University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art (UMMA)
attempts to answer this question
with its new exhibit "Instant Nar-
rative" by Dora Garcia, running
through April 27. The exhibit is
part of a larger showcase called
"Affecting the Audience." The
point of "Instant Narrative" is to
have someone write a continu-
ous narrative in real time about
the museum visitors, thus making
each person the subject of the art.
The story is then projected into
the gallery space for everyone to
read.
As a writer, I was intrigued to
see how individuals would react
once theylearned they were being
watched.
I mentioned the exhibit to a
couple friends and theyexpressed
interest, so when I decided to go
severalofthemtagged along.From
the moment I entered through the
front doors, I'd become a part of
the exhibit. The story was pro-
jected onto a blank wall making it
impossible to miss and on it were
the remnants ofafdifferentstory -
a story that I wasn't a part of, not
yet anyway.
In the corner, tucked behind
the doors and out of immediate
sight to the visitors, sat a young
man at his computer. To those not
aware of the exhibit, he appeared
to be just a student working on a
paperor aproject, but Ididn'tmiss
