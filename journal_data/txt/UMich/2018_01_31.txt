In the first hours of the 

University of Michigan’s West 
Quad Residence Hall’s armed 
robbery in early December, 
residents 
and 
staff 
grew 

concerned with the sudden 
unexplained presence of police 
vehicles outside of the dorm 
and officers in the building. 
Many residents turned to social 
media and their friends to make 
sense of the situation, and very 
rapidly, a rumor about an active 
shooter spread through campus. 
Fortunately for residents, the 
matter was determined to be a 
robbery — not an active shooter 

situation — but the incident has 
students calling for a notification 
system that will advise the 
community about developing 
stories.

For many college campuses 

across the U.S., recent incidents 
have 
community 
members 

asking if relaying important 
information to students, faculty 
and community members as it 
develops should take precedence 
over communicating developed 
crime alerts hours after the crime 
has occurred. The verification 
process is lengthy and police 
departments are often afraid of 
spreading misinformation by 
reporting facts unless they are 
absolutely certain. 

There are tips on the DPSS 

In honor of International 

Data Privacy Day, the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
School 
of 

Information and the Office of 
Information Assurance hosted 
Privacy@Michigan, 
a 
series 

of interdisciplinary panels on 
internet privacy Tuesday in 
North Quad Residence Hall. 
Approximately 100 faculty and 
community members attended.

The 
first 
panel, 
“Privacy 

in a Connected World: An 
Oxymoron?” 
dealt 
with 

generational privacy differences 
and online personal privacy. 
Sol Bermann, interim Chief 
Information 
Security 
Officer, 

moderated 
the 
event. 
Each 

speaker discussed their personal 
privacy research as well as their 
common observances of privacy 
in today’s world. 

Prior to a question and answer 

session, each speaker gave a 
brief overview of their research. 
Susan Gelman, a professor of 
psychology and linguistics, spoke 
about her research on people’s 
feelings regarding a stranger 
tracking their personal items. 
She found a divide between the 
children 
and 
undergraduate 

students she studied.

According to Gelman, children, 

up to about age six, did not have an 
issue with — and sometimes even 
liked — when a stranger was able 

to track the number of items they 
owned. However, undergraduate 
students were almost entirely 
opposed to strangers having the 
ability to track their items, citing 
an invasion of their privacy as the 
main reason for the opposition. 
She wrapped up her section of 
the panel by pondering why 
this division occurs and what is 
significant about its timing.

The second speaker, Sarita 

Yardi Schoenebeck, an assistant 

professor 
in 
the 
School 
of 

Information, spoke on issues 
of privacy in social media. She 
showed the extensive range of 
ways parents have started to 
share everything by citing the 
specific nature of some parenting 
blogs. This opened up her main 
question of why parents post 
so much information online, to 
which she responded, “They feel 
validated as a good parent.”

“For the first time in history, 

children are growing up with 
this online (presence) established 
without their permission or 
consent often started before 
they’re even born,” Schoenebeck 
said.

The 
second 
part 
of 

Schoenebeck’s talk focused on 
older childrens’ comments about 
their past online posts. She said 
most undergraduate students on 
social media tend to keep their 

On Tuesday, the American 

Enterprise Institute Executive 
Council at the University of 
Michigan — the University’s 
branch 
of 
a 
conversative 

leaning think tank based in 
Washington D.C. — held a 
talk on the Iran Deal and its 
consequences for Iran and the 
United States. Michael Rubin, a 
resident scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute and former 
Pentagon official, led the talk.

Rubin’s talk focused on the 

specifics of the Iran Deal and 
Iran protests and how the U.S. 
has reacted to the deal and its 
effects in the past.

“Rather than simply engage 

in the political fight between 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 

about whether or not this deal 
is a good thing, the fact of the 
matter is we also need to be 
forward-looking in regard to 
our policy,” Rubin said.

One of the key points of the 

talk centered on the premise of 
the Iran Deal. The main focus 
of this deal was to ensure Iran 
reduced its nuclear facilities;

DACA, economic policy, transparency important for politicians, students this year

As the year begins to kick into 

gear, activist groups and politicians 
are starting to implement goals for 
2018. It will no doubt prove to be 
another tumultuous year in U.S. 

politics, as the federal government 
will likely tackle immigration 
and entitlement reform — two 
long-standing 
and 
particularly 

contentious issues that tend to 
arouse high passions on either 
side of the political spectrum. 
Midterm elections in November 
will certainly be equally hard-
fought, as Democrats attempt to 

retake control of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate.

The Michigan political world 

may prove just as exciting, as 
the federal in 2018. Members of 
the legislature will be working 
to pass a budget during the first 
several 
months, 
with 
likely 

Republican victories in store. 
Michigan Democrats will use 

their comparatively smaller, but 
vocal, caucus to bring new issues 
into the statewide debate. Voters 
will choose a new governor on 
Nov. 6, bringing an end to current 
Governor Rick Snyder’s two terms 
in office.

than 
Student 
Government 

Council. Yet fraternities still do 
more. 

That is why we’re the best. 

MSU trustees appoint John Engler as 
interim president of the University 

The announcement received mixed reviews from Nassar survivors, MSU and state communities

It 
is 
anticipated 
the 

Michigan State University 
Board 
of 
Trustees 
will 

appoint John Engler, former 
governor of Michigan from 
1991 to 2003, as interim 
president of MSU following 
the resignation of Lou Anna 
Simon.

Simon released a statement 

of resignation after criticism 
surrounding 
the 
case 
of 

Larry Nassar, a former MSU 
and USA Gymnastics doctor 
who received 40-175 years in 
prison for sexual abuse.

During 
Nassar’s 

sentencing in Ingham county, 
The Detroit News released 
a report stating Simon and 
thirteen other high ranking 
MSU officials had knowledge 
of Nassar’s misconduct. 

“To the survivors, I can 

never say enough that I 
am so sorry that a trusted, 
renowned 
physician 
was 

really such an evil, evil 
person who inflicted such 
harm under the guise of 
medical treatment. I know 
that we all share the same 
resolve to do whatever it 
takes to avert such tragedies 
here and elsewhere,” her 
statement read. 

Last week, the Detroit 

Free 
Press 
reported 
the 

succession 
plan 
with 

potential candidates BVfor 
interim president including 
Engler, along with former 

Michigan 
governors 

James 
Blanchard 
and 

Jennifer Granholm. The 
board will convene at 9 
a.m. Wednesday, where it 
is expected Engler will be 
appointed.

Rachael Denhollander, 

the 
first 
woman 
to 

publicly 
announce 
her 

allegations 
against 

Nassar, took to Facebook 
to write she is “beyond 
disappointed” with the 
selection of Engler.

“Engler 
is 
a 
deep 

political insider at MSU,” 
Denhollander 
wrote. 

“At a time the university 
desperately needs, and 
survivors 
pleaded 
for, 

outside 
accountability 

and leadership, the Board 
chooses one of the most 
entrenched 
insiders. 

Despite the Board’s words 
about accountability, it is 

business as usual. I sincerely 
hope the Board reconsiders.”

In 
a 
later 
post, 
she 

acknowledged 
the 

expectation 
that 
Engler 

will indeed serve as interim 
president, 
expressing 
her 

hope that “he will act with 
leadership and integrity.”

The decision to appoint 

Engler has received criticism 
from 
Democrats 
across 

the state, while Michigan 
Republicans 
have 
praised 

the 
selection. 
Michigan 

Republican Party Chairman 
Ron Weiser stated he feels 
Engler 
will 
provide 
the 

experience necessary during 
the transition period in a 
previous 
interview 
with 

MLive.

“Governor Engler is an 

excellent 
choice 
to 
lead 

MSU in this difficult time. 
Both his pride for his alma 
mater and his reputation as a 
reformer will serve this great 
institution well as they seek 
to right the ship,” Weiser 
said.

Both 
state 
Sen. 
Curtis 

Hertel, D-East Lansing, and 
Michigan Democratic Party 
Chair Brandon Dillon have, 
according to the report from 
MLive, spoke on Engler’s 
connection 
to 
Attorney 

General Bill Schuette and his 
investigation of MSU, a tie 
that may create a conflict of 
interest. According to Dillon, 
Engler’s 
previous 
position 

as Governor allowed him to 
assist 
Schuette’s 
political 

career following his defeat 
for a position in U.S. Senate.

“I think it’s just another 

problem for Bill Schuette,” 
Dillon said. “Another day, 
another conflict of interest.”

Daily Staff Reporter

Civil rights activist and 

writer Shaun King endorsed 
Abdul El-Sayed for governor in 
a press release distributed by 
El-Sayed’s campaign Tuesday.

“(Abdul) cares about all of 

Michigan and will put the state 
on the path to be being a beacon 
of equality and fairness,” King 
said in the press release. “I 
believe in Abdul and will fight 
my heart out to help him help 
Michigan!”

King rose to prominence 

after his coverage of the 
shooting of Michael Brown 
in 2014. He has since written 
extensively 
about 
various 

civil rights issues and is now 
a columnist for The Intercept. 
King is known for utilizing 
social 
media, 
particularly 

Twitter, to advocate for social 
and political causes such as the 
Black Lives Matter movement.

The 
El-Sayed 
campaign 

believes 
King’s 
support 

indicates 
that 
El-Sayed’s 

platform is consistent with the 
national progressive agenda.

“Shaun is one of our nation’s 

leading voices for equity and 
racial justice,” El-Sayed said in 
the press release. “His support 
tells us that our progressive 
ideals and policy ideas for 
Michigan are consistent with a 
broader progressive movement 
toward a more just, equitable, 
and sustainable country.”

King’s 
endorsement 

arrives 
after 
El-Sayed 

released 
an 
urban 
agenda 

on Monday, which includes 
policy 
proposals 
aimed 
at 

strengthening 
Michigan’s 

cities. In the urban agenda, 

El-Sayed 
outlines 
his 

approach 
to 
bettering 

Michigan’s economy, housing 
market, public transportation, 
environment, criminal justice 
system and auto insurance.

“Our cities can be places 

that 
generate 
growth 
and 

prosperity, 
but 
that 
will 

require a new vision and 
new policies: policies that 
prioritize people over profits 
and doggedly pursue equity,” 
the urban agenda stated.

emergency, such as the “Run, 
Hide, Fight” strategy if an active 
attacker enters campus. DPSS 
also launched a new smartphone 
app in 2017 which provides DPSS 
news and crime alerts.

The 
University 
of 
North 

Carolina at Chapel Hill has been 
criticized for its current alert 
system as well. The university’s 
newspaper published an article 
earlier 
this 
month 
citing 

problems with their notification 
system, AlertCarolina, after an 
alert was sent 45 minutes after an 
explosion near campus.

Currently, all students and 

faculty are automatically signed 
up to receive emergency alerts 
through their University email. 
However, users have to manually 
register for emergency alerts 
to receive texts through the 
Michigan app or as text messages 
on their mobile devices. For text 
alerts, opting-in requires that 
users enter the Wolverine Access 
site online to sign up for alerts. 

However, many students have 

not seen an incentive to download 
either 
Michigan 
or 
DPSS 

application, other than searching 
for dining hall information and 
bus schedules, unlike the Canvas 
app, 
which 
allows 
students 

to 
check 
assignments 
and

there was a shooter in West Quad. 
Are you ok?’” Jo said.

After the incident was reported 

to the police, the Division of 
Public Safety and Security sent 
out a crime alert via email to 
students and faculty about an 
armed robbery in West Quad. 
The crime alert was not sent out 
until 2:00 a.m., hours after the 
robbery had occurred at 10:00 
p.m., according to DPSS.

In a prior statement about the 

robbery, DPSS said they were not 
notified of the incident until 30 
minutes after it occurred. 

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown clarified the difference 
between crime alerts, which 
are sent through email, and 
emergency alerts, which can be 
delivered as push notifications 
through the Michigan App or 
optional 
text 
alerts 
through 

Wolverine Access. She explained 
emergency alerts are reserved 
for urgent situations that require 
immediate community action.

“If we have confirmed reports 

of 
some 
kind 
of 
imminent 

emergency, where we believe a 
majority of our campus needs 
to take immediate action for 
their safety, we would issue an 
emergency alert,” Brown said. 
“When I said we need a confirmed 
report, the confirmation doesn’t 
necessarily mean that a police 
officer has gone to that location, 

and said ‘Yes, this is what’s 
happened.’ But we need to have 
something more than someone 
saying, ‘You know I heard this 
sound in the parking structure 
and it sort of sounded like gunfire 
but it could have been a car 
backfiring.’”

Brown 
explained 
there 

was a delay in emailing of the 
crime 
alert 
because 
police 

quickly determinde there was 
no 
imminent 
threat 
to 
the 

community. She also said in the 
West Quad robbery DPSS had 
received reports that the suspects 
had left the building.

“There is a lot of difference 

between 
somebody 
having 

possession of a weapon and 
somebody 
having 
possession 

of a weapon, brandishing it, 
threatening 
people, 
shooting 

people, (and) running around,” 
Brown said.

Jo said he was concerned 

no message from a person of 
authority relayed information to 
students during the West Quad 
incident. He cited the delayed 
crime alerts as a communication 
issue between DPSS and the 
community and suggested that 
DPSS should include on-going or 
developing story alerts.

“I think that was what was 

frustrating for us was not really 
knowing,” Jo said. “I think 
getting that crime alert out while 
something is actually happening 
instead of when it’s already dealt 
with.”

activist groups to assess their 
goals for the coming year. Below 
are some 

previews of what may be in 

store for 2018.

College Democrats
On campus, the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 

College Democrats is focusing 
on 
increasing 
student 
and 

community engagement. Public 
Policy junior Lauren Schandevel, 
communications 
director 
for 

the College Democrats, said 
the group hopes to channel the 
political energy left over from 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

election into tangible action.

“A lot of people are frustrated, 

angry or concerned about the 
current administration — and 
rightfully so,” Schandevel said. 
“We want to recruit these people 
to knock doors, make calls and 
get involved in ways that can not 
only alleviate some of the stress 
they are experiencing, but also 
make a difference in shaping the 
future of our country.”

The College Democrats are 

aiming to emulate the goals 
and strategies of the national 
Democratic Party, which entails 
mobilizing community members.

“Like 
the 
national 
party, 

we are also shifting our focus 
from a top-down to a more 
bottom-up approach by training 
our members to organize and 
engage with members of the 
community,” Schandevel said.

She 
said 
the 
College 

Democrats’s mobilization efforts 
will be dedicated to ensuring 
Democratic 
candidates 
get 

elected into all levels of office in 
2018 elections. Part of the group’s 
role this year will be to bring 
candidates to campus to discuss 
their campaigns and key issues so 
students can engage in different 
races across Michigan.

Another main goal for the 

College Democrats is to increase 
voter turnout by collaborating 
with 
like-minded 
student 

organizations. 
Schandevel 

said this will involve College 
Democrats 
expanding 
their 

reach 
and 
participating 
in 

campus-wide campaigns like the 
Stop Spencer coalition.

“In 2018, we hope to connect 

with more groups and maintain 
a 
coalition 
of 
progressive 

organizations that can come 
together and mobilize students 
around 
common 
goals,” 

Schandevel said.

 College Republicans
The 
University’s 
chapter 

of College Republicans is also 
looking to get involved with 
the 2018 elections. Engineering 
sophomore 
Lincoln 
Merrill, 

the 
group’s 
communications 

chair, told The Daily in an email 
interview that his organization is 
excited to continue the progress 
made in 2017.

“We will continue to be 

involved in the 2018 midterm 
elections 
and 
hope 
to 
be 

active 
throughout 
the 
year 

trying to help the conservative 
candidates,” 
Merrill 
wrote. 

“Overall, we believe 2018 will 
be a very successful year as we 
continue to build on our positive 

momentum from the past year.”

The 
College 
Republicans 

chapter hopes to continue to 
grow their presence on campus 
by increasing membership and 
hosting events throughout the 
year. They are bringing Charlie 
Kirk, founder of conservative 
education group Turning Point 
USA, to campus in February. A 
conservative 
women’s 
panel, 

which will potentially include 
RNC 
Chair 
Ronna 
Romney 

McDaniel, is being planned for 
later in the spring.

“We want to continue to foster 

good debate on campus and give 
conservative students an outlet 
to express themselves,” Merrill 
wrote. 

 
Congresswoman 
Debbie 

Dingell

U.S. 
Rep 
Debbie 
Dingell, 

D-Ann Arbor, wants 2018 to be 
a year of national conversation 
about critical issues that are 
concerning to the Democratic 
Party. 

“We need to talk about the 

economy and jobs, pensions and 
secure retirement, education and 
student loans, the environment 
and the Great Lakes,” Dingell 
said. “There’s a lot of issues that 
we’ve got to talk about. This 
November’s election will impact 
what happens to those issues.”

Among her personal goals, 

Dingell 
mentions 
improved 

infrastructure in Michigan, net 
neutrality, addressing student 
loans and finding a solution to 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals.

Dingell 
emphasized 
her 

passion for increasing access to 
affordable 
quality 
healthcare 

and addressing rising insurance 

premiums and deductibles. In 
Michigan, she wants to make 
sure the automobile industry is 
innovating and thriving.

“I’m committed to working 

with everybody to make sure 
that we stay at the forefront of 
innovation 
and 
technology,” 

Dingell said. “It’s an important 
issue for Michigan. Our state’s 
always 
been 
synonymous 

with the development of the 
automobile.”

She 
mentioned 
the 
SELF 

DRIVE Act as critical for the 
evolving automobile industry. 
Dingell is on the Committee 
on 
Energy 
and 
Commerce, 

which 
unanimously 
passed 

the bipartisan legislation that 
improves the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration’s 
ability to apply new safety 
standards 
to 
self-driving 

cars, and clarifies federal and 
state roles regarding the new 
technology.

Dingell also stressed how 

critical student activism is to 
furthering 
the 
Democratic 

Party’s 
goals 
and 
achieving 

political change. She referenced 
how she was a college student 
when 
she 
started 
getting 

involved in politics.

“I got involved when I was in 

college,” Dingell said. “I went 
door to door. I worked phones. I 
cared about issues.”

With the 2018 midterms on the 

horizon, she said student groups 
have the power to increase voter 
turnout and impact election 
results.

lifting 
economic 
sanctions 

placed on Iran did that.

After 
neighboring 
nation 

Iraq managed to hide nuclear 
facilities from the United Nates, 
stricter inspections of countries’ 
nuclear facilities were added to 
the deal. According to Rubin, 
Iran chose to accept — not 
ratify — the treaty, resulting 
in the country receiving new 
technology without increased 
inspections. 

“Whatever you think about 

the deal, we still need to … be 
forward-leaning to deal with 
Iran as the terms of this deal 
start to expire,” Rubin said. 
“It’s going to happen faster than 
many people expect it.”

The talk shifted to protests 

within Iran and how these 
protests 
immediately 
turned 

on Iran’s security forces. The 
focus of the protests centered 
on common complaints, like 
those of Iranian workers, which 

according 
to 
Rubin, 
include 

unpaid 
wages, 
not 
foreign 

politics.

Rubin also mentioned the 

effect of demographics on the 
protests in Iran. He discussed 
how young adults primarily held 
the protests, but as these young 
adults grow older and have 
children, they will be less likely 
to protest out of fear of losing 
their families.

“Different people can think 

in very different ways, and I 
would argue that it is culturally 
arrogant to project our own 
value system onto others and 
assume that other people think 
like us,” Rubin said.

Additionally, 
Rubin 

discussed a bounty the Turkish 
government has placed on him as 
a result of his analysis predicting 
a possible coup in Turkey. After a 
failed coup in 2016, the Turkish 
government issued an arrest 
warrant for Rubin and a bounty 
of 3 million Turkish liras (about 
$800,000).

older posts in order to seem 

more real online.

“(Undergraduates) 
say 
that 

they are embarrassed by these 
old photos but typically they don’t 
delete them because that would be 
inauthentic,” Schoenebeck said.

She closed her portion of the 

panel by concluding that parents 
and children should think of 
themselves together, not separate, 
in terms of social media.

J. Alex Halderman, an electrical 

engineering and computer science 
professor, spoke about how privacy 
and 
security 
work 
together. 

Halderman said he wanted to 
“celebrate some of what technology 
is doing well” instead of focusing 
on the negatives related to privacy.

He discussed the benefits and 

advancements privacy has made 
through encryption.

“It’s never been possible before 

to send a message to the other side 
of the world with a pretty high 
assurance that nobody is going to 
be able to read it,” Halderman said.

Halderman also talked about 

Facebook, saying privacy on the 
medium has improved and is not 
the only problem.

“Many of us like to argue people 

are oversharing,” Halderman said. 
“They also provide very fine grain 
and detailed controls about how 
your information is going to be 
shared.”

Florian Schaub, an assistant 

professor 
in 
the 
School 
of 

Information and an organizer of 

the event, was the final speaker 
of the first panel. Schaub focused 
on asking how people can learn to 
make better privacy decisions.

“People struggle to make good 

privacy decisions,” Schaub said. 
“People 
are 
concerned 
about 

privacy but … don’t even know 
where to start.”

Schaub outlined three potential 

solutions to this decision problem. 
The first solution was to provide 
relevant information to citizens, 
not material manufactured by 
legal professionals, in hopes of 
seeing privacy policies that are 
more concise and understandable. 
The second was to make the 
information 
in 
these 
policies 

easier to be acted upon. His third 
solution was to embed privacy into 
interaction.

After Schaub’s talk, Bermann 

opened the floor to questions 
which brought forth many new 
thoughts on privacy.

In response to a question on why 

Gelman did not include teenagers 
in her study, she said she didn’t 
believe there would be a large 
enough impact on this age range.

“Honestly 
it’s 
because 
we 

couldn’t imagine that by 10 years 
of age kids wouldn’t be (affected) 
by privacy implications of this 
stranger tracking their backpack,” 
Gelman said.

When asked a question on 

the government’s role in privacy 
and security, Halderman said 
he wished the government was 
involved in more elements of 
personal privacy due to their 
breadth of resources.

country,” Caulkins said. “So the cap 
is a lot lower, and usually we don’t 
actually reach the cap that is set.”

President Donald Trump has 

set the ceiling for 2018 to be 45,000 
refugees — a drastic decrease from 
the 110,000 refugee cap enforced 
under the Obama administration 
in 2016.

When 
Pharmacy 
student 

representative Ibtihal Makki asked 
what CSG could do to help MRAP, 
Caulkins responded with “speak 
out, make donations, volunteer, call 
your representatives and educate 
yourself.” 

Sarkar then gave her “State 

of the Campus” address in the 
mode of Trump’s State of the 
Union address Tuesday night. 
The address covered all aspects of 
campus life, including University 
sports, 
financial 
aid, 
campus 

performances, 
sustainability, 

CSG work, sexual assault and 
misconduct 
prevention 
and 

campus climate. After discussing 
the 40 percent increase in reported 
incidents of sexual assault on 
campus in the past year Sarkar said 
the reporting process should put 
more faith in those willing to speak 
out.

“When survivors speak out 

about the pain and abuse they’ve 
faced, believe them,” Sarkar said.

In regards to campus climate, 

Sarkar discussed campus protests 
in response to racist incidents; 
Rackham student Dana Greene 

taking a knee in the Diag, a swastika 
found in the Modern Languages 
Building and the possibility of 
Richard Spencer speaking on 
campus in the near future.

“Marginalized students have 

been dealt blow after blow this 
past year, but not this past year 
alone,” Sarkar said. “It is of utmost 
importance that we do not let these 
forces of evil and hatred divide us 
… And if we stand strong, then the 
state of our campus will remain 
strong.”

During community concerns, 

LSA freshman Elizabeth Larky-
Savin asked CSG to join her 
in 
starting 
an 
informational 

campaign to address issues of 
congestion 
on 
campus 
buses. 

Larky-Savin sent out a survey to 
bus-riders regarding the issues, 
and 82.5 percent of respondents to 
the survey said they have trouble 
fitting on the buses, due to sheer 
congestion or particular students 
taking up too much room. Larky-
Savin requested the assembly aid 
her in teaching students about 
bus etiquette and alternate routes 
they can take to avoid congestion, 
whether that be in an email every 
semester or a video at freshman 
orientation.

CSG Vice President Nadine 

Jawad went on to address the 
recent 
critiques 
the 
Campus 

Affordability Guide has received. 
The guide, released last week, has 
been criticized for not addressing 
true 
affordability 
issues, 
but 

rather suggesting cost-effective 
tips, such as cutting down on 
impulse purchases, that could 
only be utilized by higher-income 
students.

“I hold myself accountable for 

the writing that was submitted 
because I should’ve given a more 
critical lens to the groups that 
were being marginalized in the 
content that we put out,” Jawad 
said. “I think the people that went 
to look in that guide were looking 
for something different than what 
we gave them … The guide was 
in no way intended to address or 
solve issues in the housing market 
process.”

Previously, Jawad posted a 

comment on Facebook in response 
to critics, saying the Guide was the 
product of research on housing 
with the city of Ann Arbor.

“As the director of this guide, and 

as a first-gen student who struggles 
with finances and costs here, this 
is a misrepresentative portrayal of 
two years of compiling research,” 
Jawad wrote. “My advocacy on 
affordable housing started with 
a journey through 15+ meetings 
with Ann Arbor commissioners 
and council members as well 
as several meetings with U-M 
Housing. CSG actually helped 
institute a student advisory board 
to City Council last winter as a 
result of some of this research. 
This guide is a compilation of 
notes, but doesn’t erase the fear 
of prices in an ever-increasingly 
expensive city that doesn’t feel like 
someone like me can fit in or afford. 
SES and inaccessibility to low-
income students isn’t a joke and is 
worthy of more than a string of FB 
comments.

L

ast week, I attended a town 
hall meeting hosted by Stop 
Spencer at the University 

of Michigan, which was set up in 
order to discuss Richard 
Spencer’s 
impending 

visit to campus. I wanted 
to catch myself up on 
the current situation, 
the 
likelihood 
he 

would 
actually 
come 

and to understand the 
University’s response to 
this saga.

I want to respond 

to two different things 
that I learned. First, 
according to the organizers 
of the meeting — who did an 
incredible job presenting all of the 
information — administrators have 
made no contact with Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CAPS) 
to either understand the status of or 
to improve the mental well-being of 
their students.

This 
failure 
to 
coordinate 

with CAPS demonstrates an act 
of callousness. And it entirely 
contradicts 
the 
University’s 

publicly disseminated, “official” 
position. In one of the sparse, 
vague 
statements 
released 
by 

the University about Spencer’s 
visit, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald wrote, “The university 
will carefully consider [Spencer’s] 
request, paying close attention 
to the safety and security of our 
community.”

Since I began writing this 

column, 
the 
University 
has 

announced that Spencer will not 
be coming this semester. I urge you, 
the reader, the campus community, 
anyone, to not understand this as a 
victory, but simply as the University 
kicking this disgusting can further 
down the road. Even with this 
news, I think we should deliberate 
about Spencer’s potential visit.

We might, for example, pause 

and consider the debate around 
hate speech more broadly. Why 
would the University want Spencer 
to come here? I believe it’s because 
the University would like to 
demonstrate the strength of this 
institution. This position might say 
that no one individual, regardless 
of their beliefs, can tarnish what 
we have collectively made here. 
By allowing Spencer to come and 
continuing to function as a school, 
even after he is gone, we will 
emerge stronger; victorious over 
this one bigot.

But the University has arrived 

at this position without any input 
from its students. By largely 
excluding its students from these 
negotiations, 
the 
University 

is 
suppressing 
the 
voices 
of 

marginalized communities — the 
victims of Spencer’s hate speech — 
in order to promulgate this image 

of strength in the face of evil. To 
be clear, this school belongs to its 
students. By coming here, we give 
these administrators work to do. 

They work for and 
alongside us. And yet 
nobody among us, 
not even those most 
informed 
on 
this 

issue, knows what’s 
going on.

It 
takes 
an 

immense 
amount 

of 
exclusionary 

privilege to declare 
what 
will 
make 

our 
University 

stronger, 
especially 

as marginalized communities are 
crying foul in the face of those 
declarations. To arrive at the 
decision that Spencer’s presence 
will ultimately be a withstandable 
event, one that might eventually 
bring us together and prove our 
collective strength, ignores this 
conflict entirely. The solution would 
be to engage the entire University 
community, Ann Arbor residents 
and the relevant southeastern 
Michigan communities in this 
debate. Tragically, the University is 
doing just the opposite.

What does all of this say about our 

University? What characteristics 
can be gleaned from this misguided 
response? What does it say about 
our campus climate that Richard 
Spencer, one of the most prominent 
white supremacists of our day feels 
he can come here, feels he would 
have enough of an audience here 
to make it worth his time? And, 
finally, why does the University 
believe Spencer’s presence on this 
campus would make us better off?

By not reaching out to CAPS, 

the 
University 
is 
failing 
to 

leverage its power to make a real 
difference in the mental health of 
the members of its community. 
Apparently, mental health does 
not fit the scope of the “safety and 
security” that Fitzgerald and his 
fellow administrators are trying to 
protect.

By hardly telling us — the 

students — anything about the 
ongoing 
negotiations, 
by 
not 

providing any real public space for 

a conversation between students, 
faculty and the administration to 
take place, thereby leaving it to 
uncompensated students — already 
coping with the psychological 
burden of Spencer’s impending visit 
— to make that meeting happen, the 
University is seeking to suppress 
dialogue.

By telling us that we cannot 

stop Spencer from coming here 
based on the content of his speech 
and that stopping him would lead 
to a court battle, the University is 
capitulating in the face of bigotry. 
I say, go to court for your students. 
Fight for us. By protesting (as we do 
so often), we fight for you, we fight 
to make this place more equitable. 
Now, it is your turn for an equitable 
and inclusive exchange between 
diverse groups of people. Diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion. 
Sound 

familiar? These are principals that 
you, the University, claim to uphold 
and strive for but routinely fail to 
embody.

Just by living here, students 

of color and marginalized folks 
sacrifice their sense of safety and 
their mental well-being (which you 
don’t even care about enough to 
check in with the office delegated 
for doing exactly that), and yet you 
won’t potentially lose a legal battle 
in the name of these students.

Because it would tarnish your 

reputation as a premier law school 
in the country. It would be a drag 
to be dealing with Spencer in such 
a public way. This drag, of course, 
pales in comparison to the drag that 
so many of my peers and professors 
feel in having to deal with this 
University all the time.

Maybe Spencer wants to come 

here because he can sense all of this 
in the air. Maybe he wants to come 
because the University’s shocking 
inaction has left a real void in our 
trust of the administration that 
runs our everyday lives, in the 
communication between us and 
them, in our collective feeling of 
security here in Ann Arbor, in 
our sense that we can actually do 
anything to advocate for ourselves 
in such a way to see tangible, direct, 
immediate results. He sees an 
opportunity to fill this void with his 
sick, twisted version of an answer 
to our problems.

No matter his reason, it’s time 

this University stops prioritizing 
its lofty, mystical, fake public image 
over its responsibility to take 
tangible actions to ensure the safety 
and well-being of our community. 
It’s time we stop having to judge 
this University by noticing what it is 
not, what it refuses fails to do, time 
and time and time again.

T

he federal government 
shutdown 
ended 

anticlimactically 
last 

week after three tense days, 
with a bloc of Senate Democrats 
lending their support 
to 
a 
Republican 

short-term spending 
plan. In exchange, 
Republican 
Congressional leaders 
promised to schedule 
a vote in the coming 
weeks on continuing 
the Deferred Action 
for 
Childhood 

Arrivals 
program, 

which 
President 

Donald Trump plans to dismantle.

Despite 
the 
compromise, 

a renewed struggle looms in 
the near future. The stopgap 
funding 
measure 
will 
expire 

on Feb. 8, setting the stage for a 
prolonged battle over a long-term 
spending plan. Even with the 
Republican 
concessions, 
many 

Senate Democrats and a majority 
of House Democrats still voted 
against the spending bill that 
ended the shutdown, raising the 
possibility that the government 
could shut down again, especially 
if Congress is unable to come to 
an agreement on the future of 
DACA. An even more bitter fight 
potentially waits in the distance 
over the debt ceiling, which will 
need to be raised or suspended at 
some point this year.

This shutdown — and the 

sparring to take place over the next 
few weeks — is closely intertwined 
with immigration policy, similar 
to the infamous 2013 shutdown 
revolving 
around 
Obamacare. 

While policy takes the central 
role in each iteration, the broader 
issue of the national debt looms 
above these spending battles, even 
though shutdowns are not directly 
related to the debt.

The current hyper-partisan 

political 
climate 
prevents 

Congress from reliably passing 
the 
12 
core 
appropriations 

bills, as in decades past. This 
forces Congress to fund the 
federal 
government 
with 

massive 
“omnibus 
budgets,” 

but the deep divide between 
Republicans and Democrats on 
government spending, taxation 
and the federal deficit makes this 
challenging. When legislators fail 
to agree to an omnibus budget, 
Congress must resort to funding 
the federal government through 
a series of short-term continuing 

resolutions. These continuing 
resolutions are ripe for partisan 
conflict, as evidenced by the 
current fight over DACA. Since 
their primary purpose is to simply 

keep the government 
operating, continuing 
resolutions often fail 
to address budgetary 
concerns or produce 
a plan to stabilize the 
national debt.

Though Republicans 

championed themselves 
as 
deficit 
hawks 

throughout the Obama 
administration, 
their 

actions thus far during 

the Trump presidency paint a 
different 
picture. 
The 
GOP’s 

signature piece of legislation in 
2017, the tax reform bill, slashes 
government 
revenue, 
which 

inevitably bloats the federal deficit, 
thus increasing the national debt. 
When passing the bill, Republican 
leaders argued that economic 
growth would offset the tax breaks, 
leaving government revenue levels 
the same, but this contention is 
simply not supported by the facts. 
The nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office projects the tax bill 
will pour $1.5 trillion onto the 
national debt, while an analysis by 
The Wharton School of Business 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
predicts a nearly $2 trillion 
national debt increase.

Meanwhile, 
Trump 
seems 

misinformed about the national 
debt, despite his campaign pledge 
to eliminate it within eight years. 
On the campaign trail, Trump 
made a disturbing proposal to 
renegotiate the debt in hopes of 
persuading the U.S. government’s 
creditors to accept less than 
they are owed — in essence, 
defaulting on the national debt. 
Doing so would derail the U.S. 
economy and irreversibly destroy 
investor confidence in the federal 
government, as experts were quick 
to point out.

And after Trump was blasted 

for the proposal, he countered 
with the claim that the U.S. 
can’t default on the debt, since 
it can merely print money. This 
is technically true — the U.S. 
Treasury could theoretically just 
make the money it owes — but 
this “solution” is nonetheless 
ludicrous, as it would lead to 
catastrophic inflation and major 
economic problems of its own.

Since 
his 
victory 
and 

inauguration, Trump has stepped 

back 
from 
his 
renegotiation 

proposal while making several 
more suspect claims. Last October, 
Trump blamed the debt on 
foreign aid, even though such aid 
constitutes only a minute fraction 
of the federal budget. Days later, 
Trump falsely claimed that gains 
in the stock market are reducing 
the debt.

Little can be interpreted from 

the president’s statements about his 
true feelings towards the national 
debt, but his conflicting claims 
and evolving positions are clear 
evidence that his administration 
lacks a clear and realistic plan to 
address the national debt. In fact, 
Trump’s enthusiastic embrace of 
the Republican tax plan indicates 
that the debt is likely to grow far 
worse during his presidency.

In order to truly address 

the national debt, a pragmatic 
solution 
involving 
both 

reasonable 
tax 
increases 

and spending cuts is needed. 
Unfortunately, such a solution 
seems 
unlikely 
to 
manifest 

itself in the near future given 
the passage of the Republicans’ 
fiscally irresponsible tax bill 
and 
the 
Trump’s 
apparent 

commitment 
to 
wasteful 

spending on frivolous matters 
such as his infamous border wall. 
Still, voters and legislators should 
not let the national debt fade 
into the political background. 
Without concrete action and 
responsible budgeting, Congress 
could easily come to rely on 
continuing resolutions to fund 
the 
government. 
If 
these 

stopgap 
measures 
become 

the 
norm, 
shutdowns 
will 

become commonplace and our 
government’s functions will 
consistently be held hostage 
to 
partisan 
gimmicks 
and 

political feuds.

Though the end of the latest 

shutdown may bring short-term 
relief, it is no cause for celebration 
and Congressional leaders deserve 
little praise for the bare bones 
stopgap measure that temporarily 
reopened the government. With 
this spending plan only funding 
the government until Feb. 8, more 
trouble looms on the horizon, and 
always will unless political leaders 
can reach consensus on budgeting 
and implement a comprehensive 
plan to counter the nation’s 
growing debt.

Shutdown ends, but trouble looms

NOAH HARRISON | COLUMN

A

fter 
Larry 
Nassar’s 

sentencing last week, the 
convicted sexual predator 

will now serve a minimum of 100 
years in state and federal prison. It 
is an unquestionable that he will 
die there.

Controversy was elicited by 

the intense, emotional nature of 
Nassar’s sentencing. Specifically, 
the behavior of Judge Rosemarie 
Aquilina attracted a significant 
amount of the media’s attention. 
Far 
from 
being 
impersonal, 

Aquiliana ensured her fury was 
felt by Nassar. She also extended 
her empathy to each victim 
immediately after they read their 
statement, as opposed to waiting 
for every victim to speak first, as 
is convention. Hesitation towards 
her approach, if not outright 
disapproval, could be found in 
varied and credible news sources.

In an article for Vox, a public 

defender argued that Aquilina 
“overstepped her boundaries as a 
judge.” Andrew Cohen of the New 
Republic took it a step further, 
asserting that Aquilina could not 
be both “crusader for sexual assault 
victims and a tribune for those who 
are struggling to find their voice” 
while maintaining her impartiality 
as a judge who has sworn to uphold 
the U.S. Constitution.

For many, especially those with 

a respect for and a familiarity 
with tradition, it was jarring 
to see such passion in what is 
frequently 
a 
disimpassioned 

process. But as our generation 
begins to work in, for and against 
the current system of justice, it’s 
important that we recognize that 
justice is ours to define.

The 
meaning 
of 
“justice,” 

as practiced, has always been 
contested. 
For 
some, 
justice 

means retribution, as with Larry 

Nassar’s life sentence. For others, 
justice would mean rehabilitating 
Nassar, putting an expectation of 
restitution on him. Most times, 
justice entails both elements of 
suffering and penance.

What is certain is that humans 

determine how justice is carried 
out. To be inhuman is impossible. 
In the 21st century, we can no 
longer let Lady Justice wear the 
blindfold. It was supposed to 
symbolize fairness in spite of race, 
gender or wealth, but I argue that 
the blindfold is a slap in the face.

Our generation has witnessed 

countless instances where justice 
was poisoned by those tasked 
with carrying it out. We’ve seen 
police officers carry out capital 
punishment for noncompliance; 
we’ve seen the character of people 
of color be impugned by the 
media, as if any amount of teenage 
delinquency merits execution in 
the street.

We know the justice system 

counts money. It plays a part every 
time rich defendants assemble 
legal dream-teams; meanwhile, 
poor young people of color are 
often encouraged to plead guilty 
to crimes regardless of their 
culpability, saving the system 
time and money. Lady Justice, 
to be clear, peeks out from under 
her blindfold all the time, because 
we do that same thing. But our 
conversation has evolved in ways 
that have made the pretending of 
impartiality a farce.

The vision of a post-racial 

society in the wake of President 
Barack Obama’s 2008 victory 
came unraveled when segments of 
the public conscience realized that 
racism would never be a problem 
of the past. Even as Obama 
enjoyed unprecedented support 
from people of color, so too did his 

behavior attract derision in ways 
it would not have if he looked like 
our previous 44 presidents, or the 
president after him.

In America now we have two 

paths: to feign blindness, claiming 
that we don’t see race, gender or 
wealth when we make impartial 
decisions, or to acknowledge our 
vision and biases. I choose not to 
act, to pretend as if it’s possible not 
to see these factors of race, gender 
and wealth.

I’d much rather begin the hard 

work of deconstructing the social 
mores in place that allow for 
prejudice to impact impartiality. 
What good does it serve to pretend 
that the justice system works the 
same for people of color, for each 
gender, for the poor?

It’s rarely a good idea to 

remain married to the past. 
Perhaps 
more 
fittingly, 
it’s 

important 
to 
acknowledge 

that some marriages are better 
off ended. When it comes to 
the abuses of the system, it’s 
important that criminals are not 
the only ones being tried. The 
system itself must also come 
under scrutiny.

The voices that flinch at 

Judge Aquilina’s wrath have a 
point. Feelings can’t be trusted 
to fairly inflict punishment, nor 
can emotion ever be expected to 
fairly arbitrate the outcome of a 
case like Nassar’s. But we cannot 
uphold impartiality unevenly. 
It 
is 
hypocritical 
absurdity 

to pretend the system is not a 
method of cathartic vengeance 
for every victim of Nassar’s, and 
all victims of such crimes, while 
looking the other way as the 
guise of impartiality reigns.

Wednesday, January 31, 2018 — 5A

On Friday, Jan. 26, Ann Arbor 
locals and residents from the 
far corners of the mitten state 
alike flocked to the University’s 
own Hill Auditorium for the 41st 
Annual Ann Arbor Folk Festival. 
Being so close to the festival, in 
geographical terms, might make 
University students write the 
event off as a minor happening, 
but the festival is, in reality, 
central to the Ann Arbor music 
scene. At its core, Folkfest, as 
it’s often amicably referred to, 

serves two express purposes. 
First, it is a fundraiser for (and 
by) The Ark, a local venue and 
hub for all things folk. Second, 
it draws people from all over the 
Midwest together to partake in 
an oft-underappreciated genre. 
A folk festival whose headliners 
include Jason Isbell and John 
Prine can only be expected to 
meet expectations, but Friday’s 
portion of the annual event far 
surpassed them. While the final 
act of the night was always sure 
to be a success, there was never 
a dull moment during the night’s 
earlier performances. Every set 
was musically compelling and 

honest, and a few artists managed 
to touch on the current state of 
affairs in a way that felt refreshing 
and candid.
At half past six, as the audience 
continued to fill the auditorium, 
Chastity Brown took to the stage. 
If the occasional usher’s light or 
the murmur of conversation were 
distracting, she didn’t show it, 
and soon after she began playing 
the room fell quiet. With sparse 
instrumentation — acoustic and 
electric guitar as well as a single 
bass pedal — she set the tone 
for the night: intimate, soulful, 
reflective. Before playing her last 
song, she offered her thoughts

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

TV REVIEW

HBO’s latest limited series, 
“Mosaic,” bears a fitting title. Not 
only are viewers left to puzzle 
through and piece together the 
unforeseen murder of children’s 
book author Olivia Lake (Sharon 
Stone, “Total Recall”), but also to 
try and decipher what “Mosaic” 
even is — or better yet, what it 
wants to be. The series grapples 
between branding itself as a 
TV show, “an interactive app 
experience,” a more cinematic 
mystery or at times all of the 
above. This only goes to blur the 
(what should be) very clear line 
between 
poignant 
television 
and one of those predictable and 
cringey pieces of whodunit dinner 
theater. Nevertheless, I’ll give it 
this — as a narrative, “Mosaic” is 
at times much too tedious, but as 
an experience, it’s perplexing in 
all the right ways.
Originally released in the fall 
of 2017 as a choose-your-own-
adventure style app, “Mosaic”’s 
recent adaptation into a Steven 
Soderbergh (“Ocean’s Eleven”) 
six-episode TV thriller explores 
both the moments leading up 
to and the dynamic aftermath 
of Olivia’s small-town murder. 
Switching between flashbacks 
from the night of the crime to the 
reopening of the investigation 
four years later, the core of 
“Mosaic” attempts to uncover the 
real killer and bring long-overdue 
justice to Olivia’s accused fiancé, 
Eric (Frederick Weller, “In Plain 
Sight”). Even though the viewer 
has no real capability of changing 
the outcome of the story in either 
the app or the series, a constant 
thread of engaging with varying 

perspectives and weighing the 
truth is woven throughout — 
enough to make you feel like a 
detective in the case.
To say the least, the first episode 
of the series is hard to grasp. Right 
from the get-go, the audience is 
privy to a whole slew of characters 
and personalities that have some 
sort of tie to Olivia. But without a 
Google search, just what that link 
is remains fuzzy. While leaving out 
any sort of formal introductions or 
anterior characterizations does 
heighten the drama and suspense 

of the mystery, deciphering who is 
who then becomes a tiring task. It 
isn’t until episodes three and four, 
where Olivia’s almost-sister-in-
law, Petra (Jennifer Ferrin, “Hell 
on Wheels”), returns to town with 
a vengeance. With that, “Mosaic” 
proves its merit and prompts a 
full-out binge session to unearth 
how the murder actually went 
down.
It is for that reason that the 
ending of this mini-series felt 
particularly disorienting because 
— without giving too much away 
— there is a, shall I say, curious 
lack of traditional closure in the 
finale. In fact, I was left with such 
an unhealthy amount of questions 
regarding certain whereabouts 
and specifics that I (against 
previous discretion) felt the urge 
to turn to the app version of the 
exact same story to try my hand 
at some major sleuthing. While 
there are a few extra details in 
the app that were cut from the 

linear version, I still felt the 
purposeful level of dissatisfaction 
and confusion that Soderbergh so 
often intends in his work. Lucky 
for me, that void is one that can 
be filled by another Soderbergh-
confirmed season of “Mosaic,” 
though this time anthology style 
with an all new storyline.
When thinking of aspects of 
“Mosaic” that stand out above the 
rest, the camerawork is the first to 
come to mind. The way in which 
there is obviously little editing or 
special effects adds on gives the 
series a very intimate, naturalistic 
tone. The handheld feel of the 
camerwork 
truly 
allows 
any 
outside viewer to sink themselves 
into the fictional world of Summit, 
Utah. It is fascinating to feel 
both like a fly on the wall and an 
intruder while watching the same 
piece of media.
The other internal element of 
“Mosaic” that beams with allure 
is the casting. Not only is Stone 
compelling 
and 
tenacious 
as 
Olivia, but her male counterparts 
share equal degrees of charisma. 
Frederick Weller is gritty and 
captivating in his scenes behind 
bars, and Garrett Hedlund (“Tron: 
Legacy”), as an aspiring artist and 
murder suspect Joel, fights his 
inner demons and overwhelming 
anxiety 
with 
honesty 
and 
refinement.
While it may be difficult to 
explain all the nuances of the plot 
here, you too will be sucked into 
the whirlwind that is “Mosaic” 
after a mere six-hour watch. 
Moving 
past 
the 
wandering 
start of the series and the cliché 
tropes that come along with 
every murder mystery, “Mosaic” 
presents itself as a sleek noir that 
sets a new standard of innovation 
for TV production. 

‘Mosaic’ is a whirlwind

MORGAN RUBINO
Daily Arts Writer

on the past year, recounting in 
specific an incident immediately 
before one of her shows when a 
white supremacist approached 
her, 
shouting 
insults 
and 
threatening violence. Though the 
story itself was disheartening, 
Brown’s tone during the following 
song 
was 
overwhelmingly 
hopeful. With the mood defined 
and a powerful set delivered, she 
exited the stage.
One thing that we absolutely 
can’t help but credit The Ark for 
is their efficiency. Every year, 
Folkfest is a demonstration not 
only of folk music and the culture 
that surrounds it, but also of 
entertainment at peak efficiency. 
Only 
moments 
after 
Brown 
exited and before her applause 
had subsided, emcee Joe Pug 
appeared stage right, guitar and 
harmonica at the ready. A talented 
musician in his own right, and 
even more impressive entertainer, 
Pug kept the audience’s attention 
between sets. While he played 
original songs and offered his 
tastefully subtle sense of humor, 
stage hands and audio engineers 
prepared the stage for the next 
set with a degree of coordination 
that could qualify as art in and of 
itself.
After Brown came the duo of 
Dead Horses, comprised of Sarah 
Vos on acoustic guitar and Daniel 
Wolff on double bass. Though an 
ostensibly odd pairing, the two 
managed to fill the room with 
their hymnal-like sound, Wolff’s 
fingers dexterous on the neck of 
his bass. Next was Lori McKenna, 
writer of “Humble and Kind,” 
which took the Grammy for 

Best Country Song in 2017. Her 
apparent comfort on stage was 
infectious, no doubt a product of 
her experience as a performer, 
and the songs she performed 
were influenced in part by her five 
children.
Also a proud parent — though 
to four rather than five — 
Massachusetts-based 
Stephen 
Kellogg played the final set before 
intermission, a rousing romp that 
consisted of just four or five songs, 
ones that made me wish he would 
play one or two or five more. What 
was beautiful about Kellogg’s 
performance 
was 
his 
sheer 
exuberance at being on stage. He 
beamed out at the audience with 
an eagerness and thankfulness 
that was reflected perfectly in the 
energy with which he delivered 
his uplifting folk-anthems. It was 
hard not to be excited both with 
him and for him.
Following intermission were 
JJ Grey & Mofro, a prolific group 
whose performance received an 
immediate standing ovation at 
its conclusion. The act featured 
not one but two trumpets, both 
of whom played huge solos, and 
John 
Higginbotham 
(aka 
JJ 
Grey) himself on harmonica. 
Afterward, Jason Isbell and the 
400 Unit took to the stage. Now, 
although 41st anniversaries don’t 
tend to be particularly notable 
in and of themselves, the Folk 
Festival’s 41st marked at least 
one significant change. During 
the final set of the night, several 
stadium-style lights came on, 
filling the hall with motion and 
colorful patterns. This was the 
first year for these features, 

and more than providing pretty 
visuals, they signify growth for 
the festival, and hopefully not a 
departure from what has made it 
so near and dear to Ann Arbor’s 
heart for the past two generations.
Isbell 
and 
company’s 
set 
made the lights feel appropriate, 
and 
guitar 
solos 
abounded. 
The most valuable parts of the 
performance, 
though, 
came 
between 
songs, 
when 
Isbell 
exhibited his charisma, making 
well-received jabs at the kind of 
people who leave the room when 
he plays “White Man’s World” 
and giving a nod, before his 
last song, to his struggles with 
alcoholism. It was the sort of 
honesty that wouldn’t necessarily 
be expected from a festival 
headliner, even if the festival were 
a folk festival in Ann Arbor, and 
that’s not even mentioning the 
counterintuitiveness of Isbell’s 
decision to write and perform a 
song that he knows challenges a 
significant portion of his listeners. 
At the end of the night, attendees 
had a choice: They could leave 
Hill with a splendid night of music 
behind them, memories of soaring 
vocals and subtle harmonies, 
harmonica solos played at a 
breakneck pace and softly sung 
acoustic-guitar 
ballads, 
or 
choose to see a community being 
fostered. Four bars of music can 
sound as pleasant as you want, 
but it’s seeing and knowing the 
human side of it that makes those 
melodies truly awe-inspiring and 
that brings the folk community 
together. It makes me excited for 
Folkfest 2019 — even just two days 
after 2018’s iteration.

Big Ticket: blackbear & 
Roy Woods to play Hill

EVENT PREVIEW

INTERSCOPE

artists 
on 
their 
own campus for 
discounted prices,” 
said Valdes.
Tickets to the 
performance

It 
makes 
perfect 
sense 
for David Wain, one of the 
masterminds behind “Wet Hot 
American Summer,” to direct a 
biographical film behind one 
of the great figures of modern 
comedy. Douglas Kenney, who 
founded National Lampoon 

Magazine, 
wrote 
“Animal 
House” and “Caddyshack” and 
indirectly assembled much of 
the original cast of “Saturday 
Night Live,” before they were 
taken from under his nose, is 
a master of ensemble comedy. 
When a number of people work 
on one project with different 
styles of comedy, the result 
will often be something of 
widely varying quality, at least 
in each person’s eyes. Some 
respond more to screwball 
and one-liners (like me), some 

respond 
more 
to 
physical 
comedy (OK, also me). As 
was the case with National 
Lampoon, so it was with “Wet 
Hot American Summer.”
Then why, why, why does “A 
Futile and Stupid Gesture,” a 
biopic of Kenney’s tragically 
short life directed by Wain 
feel so empty? Why does a 
most 
unconventional 
man, 
played satisfyingly but not 
compellingly by Will Forte 
(“Last 
Man 
on 
Earth”), 
receive a harshly conventional 
treatment? These are questions 
Wain must answer, both to 
us and to his comedy idols. 
Perhaps the starting point is 
the too often-made conflation 
between bombast and being 
interesting. 
In 
a 
decision 
truly 
befitting 
the 
film’s 
title, Kenney’s story is told 
by “modern” Doug (Martin 
Mull, “Veep”), who committed 
suicide in 1980. In an attempt 
to further humanize the man 
for whom a filmic depiction 
should be sufficient, Kenney’s 
resurrection feels not only 
strange, 
but 
somewhat 
malevolent, 
a 
cinematic 
dancing-on-the-grave of sorts.
Kenney, 
especially 
his 
romantic 
and 
professional 

relationships, is so naturally 
compelling. Having his story 
told lifelessly and whittled 
down to nothing for the sake 
of event-retelling feels like 
a giant missed opportunity. 

It’s not that the film is 
dramatically bad — in fact, it’s 
often rather funny (but not 
enough) — it’s just so utterly 
mediocre that it ends up just 
meaning nothing more than an 
excuse for Wain to pay homage

SUNDANCE REVIEW

NETFLIX

to his role model. That’s good 
enough for him, but not for us.
***
The 
title 
of 
“Hearts 
Beat Loud,” the latest film 
from 
director 
Brett 
Haley 
(“The 
Hero”) 
comes 
from 
a song written by one of its 
protagonists 
Sam 
(Kiersey 
Clemons, 
“Flatliners”), 
one 
day after she takes a pre-med 
summer school class before 

going off to UCLA. Her teacher 
explains that the heart beats 
loudly during cardiovascular 
stress, but also, he says with 
something of a wink when 
someone falls in love. Later 
that same day, Sam meets 
Rose (Sasha Lane, “American 
Honey”) and, sure enough, 
she takes a liking to her. Her 
heart, beating loudly, becomes 
the subject of a song that she, 
after refusing several times, 
records with her father Frank 
(Nick 
Offerman, 
“Comrade 
Detective”), who is a retired 
musician who now owns a 
fading record shop in Red 
Hook, Brooklyn, a seemingly 
magical neighborhood where 
everyone knows each other. 
In a sort of twist, after 
Frank secretly uploads the 

song to Spotify and it appears 
on the New Indie Mix playlist, 
“Hearts Beat Loud” becomes 
something of a minor hit. 
While it doesn’t lead to any 
tangible 
financial 
benefits, 
and We’re Not a Band — the 
adamant response by Sam 
that Frank turned into their 
name — doesn’t become a 
major 
phenomenon, 
father 
and daughter become closer. 
“Hearts Beat Loud” doesn’t 
offer anything by way of twists 
and turns, but it’s a delightful 
movie at which, when it hits 
theaters, one can imagine in 
late July, audiences will have 
a splendid time. What’s not 
to love? Offerman is reliably 
goofy, Clemons and Lane are 
charming 
and 
convincingly 
enamored with one another. 
Ted 
Danson 
(“The 
Good 
Place”), who plays Frank’s 
local bartender and friend, 
delivers some great jokes. The 
songs by We’re Not a Band, 
which sound something in 
between “Ultralife” by Oh 
Wonder and “Slip Away” by 
Perfume Genius, erring on the 
pop side, are pretty great!
There are some knots in the 
plot, which contains a tad too 
many threads for such a breezy 
movie. A strange will-they-
won’t-they dynamic between 
Frank and his landlord Leslie 
(Toni Collette, “xXx: Return 
of Xander Cage”) feels forced 
and never leads to any sort of 
emotional peaks or valleys. 

Tacked on is a thread of Frank’s 
mother 
Marianne 
(Blythe 
Danner, who worked with 
Haley in “I’ll See You in My 
Dreams”), who is repeatedly 
arrested for shoplifting, even 
in her golden years.

Artificial though it is, this 
is also a film with some killer 
indie cred. Mitski is name-
checked (a major thrill for yours 
truly, who could identify when 
Sasha 
Lane 
recommended 
“Your Best American Girl” 
without mentioning the artist) 
and Frank explains the merits 
of Animal Collective’s “My 
Girls.” Once Frank realizes 
that he needs to let go of his 
too-strong attachments to his 
college-bound daughter and 
his 17-year-old record store 
and develop a sense of parental 
responsibility, there is some 
tender emotional digging that 
might bring a faint tear to the 
eye.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Singer-songwriter Rachael 
Yamagata 
is 
returning 
to 
Ann 
Arbor 
for 
a 
soulful 
performance on her United 
States 
tour. 
Yamagata 
has 

collaborated with many well-
known artists in the past 
(including 
Bryan 
Adams 
and Jason Mraz), and is now 
bringing her own poetic style 
to The Ark this Thursday.
Yamagata started off her 
career and love of music non-
traditionally. 
She 
did 
not 
enjoy piano lessons growing 
up, 
and 
she 
struggled 
to 
find herself during college, 
bouncing 
between 
majors 
and universities. She finally 
found her calling by playing 
around on the piano and 
seeing the funk group Bumpus 
play in Chicago while she was 
in college. This inspiration 
was all that she needed as 
validation to start her career. 
Yamagata became infatuated 
with the idea of talented 
people her age playing music 
for the fun of it and realized 
that a music career is what she 
wanted to pursue.
“I’m really excited about 
(taking) 
down 
the 
fourth 

wall — having a living room 
style, special experience,” said 
Yamagata, in an interview 
with The Daily. The intimate 
concert is bound to be a 
personal 
experience 
for 
everyone who comes.
“(I hope my concert) can 
inspire 
people,” 
she 
said. 
“Almost like when you go see a 
movie by yourself, (and) you’re 
like, ‘Wow, I really felt that 
wholeheartedly.’” 
Yamagata 
hopes to reach every member 
of the audience, affecting them 
in personal and unique ways. 
Her music aims to affect every 
audience member differently. 
The audience brings their 
distinct experiences to the 
concert, 
while 
Yamagata 
brings her poetic lyrics and 
indie groove to dissect these 
experiences 
and 
destroy 
inhibitions, creating a raw 
experience that is meant to 
heal.
Vulnerability plays a large 
role in the songs of the set: 
“My songs are (like a) deep 
dive into what makes us really 
uncomfortable and angular, 
and makes us feel like our 
heads and hearts are going to 
explode, and then I put you 
back together,” she said.
Yamagata 
is 
fearless 
in 
the face of topics that are 
otherwise difficult to discuss. 
She strives to create a space 
where she encourages people 
to look at themselves in a 
different light — a concert 
dedicated to the introspective.
She hopes to break the 
emotional fronts that humans 
put up and use the power of 
her music to heal the audience. 
She creates a safe space for 
people to open up by leading 

by example and pouring her 
heart out to the audience in 
the way she knows best: song.
In addition, Yamagata has a 
special place in her heart for 
the city of Ann Arbor.

“I love that it’s a college 
town,” she said. Being in Ann 
Arbor is reminiscent of her 
own college years, and she 
is excited to give students 
what she felt with Bumpus in 
Chicago: a real, raw, emotional 
experience with music and 
people.
“Anyone in school, and you 
don’t know what you’re doing 
— it’s OK. You will figure it 
out!” Her concert is bound to 
be one of emotional depth and 
healing for anyone trying to 
find their own voice and place. 
She also encourages audiences 
to come to the show as early as 
possible to hear her opening 
act, Hemming, an acoustic 
singer-songwriter, 
whose 
compelling 
performance 
is 
also bound to inspire and heal.

Lockwood out for year 
after shoulder surgery

Three 
weeks 
ago, 
Will 

Lockwood faced a choice: He 
could attempt to play through 
his 
latest 
shoulder 
injury 

and have surgery once the 
Michigan hockey team’s season 
was over, or have surgery as 
soon as possible.

Rather 
than 
delay 
the 

inevitable, 
Lockwood 
chose 

the latter.

After 

Tuesday’s 
practice, 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson 
said that the 
sophomore 
forward 
had 

undergone 
surgery 
Tuesday 
morning, and he will not play 
again this year.

“(I) was just talking to his 

family, and everything went 
extremely well,” Pearson said. 
“Now that that’s done he’s on 
the road to recovery, and one 
day closer to being on the ice, 
whenever that is. Definitely out 
for the year but he should be 
ready to go next fall.”

While playing for the United 

States national team in a Dec. 

29 game against Canada at the 
World Junior Championships, 
Lockwood took a hit from 
behind and fell hard on his 
left shoulder. He was initially 
ruled out for the remainder of 
the tournament, and was later 
told that surgery was necessary 
after 
being 
evaluated 
by 

Michigan’s medical staff.

In 16 games this season, 

Lockwood registered four goals 
and seven assists, primarily 

playing alongside 
sophomore 
Jake Slaker and 
freshman 
Josh 

Norris 
on 
the 

Wolverines’ 
second forward 
line. 
Junior 

Brendan Warren 
has 
mostly 

filled in during 
Lockwood’s 
absence, 
and 

has found success, scoring five 
points in his last six games.

Lockwood previously missed 

five games his freshman season 
due to an injury on the same 
shoulder, 
and 
underwent 

surgery during that offseason. 
When healthy, Lockwood was 
a key player for Michigan, 
especially 
on 
offense. 
He 

tallied 20 points in his 30 
games in 2016-17, the second-
best total of any Wolverine.

“Now that 

that’s done he’s 
on the road to 

recovery.”

Struggling power play getting back to basics 

Talk to anyone on the Michigan 

hockey team — or really, anyone 
on any hockey team — and you’ll 
probably hear the phrase “pucks 
to the net,” or some variation 
thereof.

If you get enough pucks to the 

net, some of them will inevitably 
go in. It’s an idea that’s easy to 
understand and easy to repeat. 
But it’s not as easy a concept to put 
into practice.

There 
aren’t 
many 
better 

examples 
of 
this 
than 
the 

Wolverines’ power play unit. 
After last weekend’s sweep at 
the hands of No. 6 Ohio State, 
Michigan ranks 47th out of 
60 teams nationally in power 
play percentage, scoring just 15 
percent of the time with a man 
advantage.

It’s a perplexing statistic, at the 

very least. The Wolverines rank 
13th in the country in scoring and 
take more shots on goal than any 
team in the Big Ten, save for Penn 
State’s 
frenetic, 
trigger-happy 

attack. Michigan has its share 
of individual firepower — senior 
forward Tony Calderone is tied 
for the Big Ten lead in goals and 
junior forward Cooper Marody 
ranks second in assists.

But 
in 
power 
play 

situations, where you’d expect 
this 
playmaking 
talent 
to 

shine 
through 
even 
more, 

the 
Wolverines 
have 
been 

inconsistent at best. Seven times 
against the Buckeyes they went 
to the power play, and seven 
times they failed to score. Over 
Michigan’s last 14 power plays, 
they have only scored once.

“We’ve got a bunch of good 

players, so we should be able 
to have more success than we 
have (on the power play),” said 
freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 

Hughes. “Sometimes, you never 
know, hockey is a strange game.”

A team should have an easier 

time scoring when it has an 
additional player on the ice. 
There’s 
nothing 
complicated 

about the math behind it. Maybe 

that’s why Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson has stressed simplicity 
when 
addressing 
his 
team’s 

special teams struggles.

His answer? Getting pucks to 

the net.

“Just try to outnumber them at 

the net instead of trying to make 
these fancy, tic-tac-toe plays,” 
Pearson said. “Just go low to high, 
get three guys going to the net and 
one of our two guys up top gets 
something to the net.

“We need more shots. We’re on 

the perimeter too much, trying to 
make these fancy plays, and we 
slow it down and we don’t get any 
shots.”

Of course, if it was easy to make 

the easy play, the Wolverines 
would be ranked much higher in 
power play percentage.

Pearson stated that his team 

showed well in power play 
scenarios 
during 
Tuesday’s 

practice. 
But 
he 
cited 
the 

difference in atmosphere between 
practices and actual games, and 
the lack of actual chances to 
convert — Michigan averages 
3.8 power plays per game for the 
season, but has seen just 2.9 per 
contest since Jan. 5. During that 
same span, the Wolverines have 
recorded just 1.1 shots per power 

play, compared to 1.8 for their 
opponents.

“All it takes is one goal to get a 

little momentum,” Pearson said 
Tuesday. “We haven’t had many 
opportunities. Even in the games 
this weekend, (Penn State) we 
didn’t have many, Minnesota we 
didn’t had many, so we haven’t 
had a lot of time to really work on 
it in game-like situations, which 
we could use more of.”

Meanwhile, 
the 
scoring 

prowess of Marody and Calderone 
has forced opponents to key in on 
them much more closely. Physical 
play and close checking have been 
on display from opposing teams 
more and more throughout the 
season — Pearson noted how 
successful the Buckeyes were in 
taking away Marody’s time and 
space in both of their meetings.

“(Marody) and Tony have 

really drawn a lot of attention 
and rightly so, because they’re 
two really good hockey players, so 
teams are really watching them 
close,” Pearson said. “Even on the 
power play, (they’re) going to take 
those two guys away and let one 
of the other three guys beat you.”

But no matter what reasons 

may be behind Michigan’s power 
play struggles, Pearson and his 

players all came to the same 
solution: Less time spent on the 
perimeter, more hard work in and 
around the crease and more shots 
on goal.

“We’re 
over-handling 
the 

puck, I think overthinking it, 
trying to get too cute, trying to 
make the great play instead of 
just taking what they’ve given 
you,” Pearson said. “... We know 
we have the personnel. Some of 
it’s mental, some of it’s physical. I 
think a lot of it’s mental. You get 
down, you get discouraged, you 
get frustrated. And you can’t, you 
just have to get ready for the next 
power play.”

Added Marody: “I think we 

need to get back to outworking 
the penalty kill. It’s easy on a 
power play to just get a little 
lackadaisical and not keep your 
feet on the gas. If we (outwork the 
penalty kill), we’re going to have 
success.”

The Wolverines know what 

they need to do to turn their 
scuffling power play unit around. 
The keys to doing so are simple, 
and they’ve known them for some 
time.

But as this season has shown, 

simplicity can be deceptively hard 
to attain.

Matthews working to find balance offensively

Everything was seemingly 

going 
to 
plan 
for 
Charles 

Matthews.

Through 
December, 
the 

redshirt junior guard averaged 
over 16 points-per-game and 
shot a remarkable 56 percent 
from 
the 
floor. 
Using 
his 

6-foot-6, 
200-pound 
frame, 

Matthews could slash around 
weaker defenders throughout 
non-conference play for the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team.

That addressed a certain 

level of unpredictability that 
surrounded Matthews before 
the season. After transferring 
from 
Kentucky 
and 
sitting 

out last season, his fit within 
the Wolverines’ offense was a 
mystery.

But 
15 
games 
into 
his 

Michigan 
career, 
Matthews 

was 
a 
mystery 
no 
longer. 

Instead, he proved himself as 
the Wolverines’ best scorer.

“I think he’s starting to 

understand how it all fits 
together,” 
said 
coach 
John 

Beilein after Matthews scored 
29 
points 
against 
Alabama 

A&M on Dec. 22.

Fast forward five weeks, and 

it’s been a different story for the 
Chicago native.

Matthews’ 
numbers 
have 

dipped. In the nine conference 
games since the New Year, 
he’s shooting 44 percent and 
averaging 11.6 points per game 
— third on the team behind 
junior center Mortiz Wager and 
senior 
guard 

Muhammed-
Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman.

The 
drop 

led to a key 
conversation 
between 
Matthews and 
his coaches.

“The coaches 

let 
me 
know 

that I had to 
find the balance between not 
forcing it, but then not over 
‘letting-it-come-to-me.’ 
” 

Matthews said. “I had to find 
that medium, and coaches are 
still working with me on that.”

Matthews 
failed 
to 
find 

that balance against Maryland 
earlier 
this 
month. 
He 

frequently relied on off-balance 
jump 
shots, 
going 
3-for-10 

from the floor with a pair of 
turnovers.

“I want him to hunt,” Beilein 

said. 
“But 
there’s 
certain 

shots that (he) hunts that are 
tough twos — just not good 
analytically, and it’s proven 
they’re not good shots to take.”

On Monday in Michigan’s 

win 
over 
Northwestern, 

Matthews avoided many of 

those 
tought 

twos. 
In 
a 

performance 
reminiscent 
of 

those early in the 
season, he led 
the 
Wolverines 

with 14 points 
on 
6-for-11 

shooting.

But 
most 

impressive 
was 
Matthews’ 

offensive awareness that has 
escaped him at times. Twice 
he broke a stifling defense by 
getting behind the back line 
of the Wildcats’ 2-3 zone for 
dunks.

That awareness was also 

paramount to Matthews’ ability 
to facilitate for others. Faced 
with a double-team roughly 
midway through the first half, 

for example, Matthews found 
sophomore center Jon Teske 
before Northwestern’s defense 
could rotate completely, leading 
to a bucket and a foul.

It was one of five assists 

on the night for Matthews — 
the second straight game his 
passing ability has impressed 
his coach.

“He had six assists at Purdue 

(last Thursday),” Beilein said. 
“That was a monumental move 
for him to see that and score 
some points.”

Matthews’ 
blending 
of 

scoring and passing has made 
Beilein’s own balancing act even 
tougher. 
Matthews, 
Abdur-

Rahkman and freshman Jordan 
Poole are all strong scoring 
assets, but Beilein can’t play all 
three simultaneously without 
sacrificing the presence of a 
true point guard on the court.

When Matthews committed 

his first foul early in Monday’s 
contest, Poole was the first off 
the bench. Frequently, Beilein 
employs a flip-flopping of the 
two.

“We understand that — that’s 

why 
we’re 
both 
laughing,” 

Matthews 
said. 
“We 
have 

that great relationship where 
it’s like, ‘He better not make 
this shot, because I know I’m 
coming in.’

“I call him J.R. Smith — the 

human microwave. He loves 
that. In fact, I’m not going to 
call him that because he wants 
to be called that.”

Just as it is for Matthews, 

balance is the key for Poole, 
who doesn’t find many shots he 
doesn’t like. Sometimes, that 
draws ire from his coaches. 

But if he and Matthews can 

find a happy medium — both 
with the ball and in their usage 
— it could lead to more offensive 
harmony for Michigan.

“We both have these crazy 

scoring mindsets,” Matthews 
said. “Every time we get open, 
we want to shoot, but there’s a 
whole offense as well. I try to 
mentor him as well, just trying 
to balance it all.” 

MEN’S GYMNASTICS
‘M’ freshmen impress 
despite losing in debut

Nerves are always a part of 

sports.

Whether an athlete has 

been competing for decades or 
making a competitive debut, 
it’s hard to stay calm. The 
freshmen on the Michigan 
men’s 
gymnastics 
team, 

in 
particular, 
faced 
that 

challenge as they went up 
against No. 1 Oklahoma. The 
Sooners haven’t lost since 
2014.

Despite an overall team 

loss, two freshmen were a 
bright spot for the Wolverines: 
Cameron 
Bock 

and 
Jacob 

Moore.

Bock 

competed 
in 

three events: the 
pommel 
horse, 

parallel bars and 
the high bar. His 
slow handstands 
and bent knees 
on the parallel 
bars 
reduced 

his score to a 12.75, and his 
fall on Tkatchev during his 
high barroutine plummeted 
his score down to 10.6. But 
Bock’s best moment came on 
the pommel horse. He kept his 
feet together well, had good 
swings and stuck his dismount 
to earn a team high 13.55 on 
the event.

“They weren’t as nervous 

as normal freshmen would 
be,” said junior Uche Eke. 
“Cameron Bock hit a really nice 
pommel horse set. They were 
hitting good sets in the gym 
so it just showed that practice 
reflects your competition.”

Moore competed in four 

events on the day — scoring 
14.05 on both the vault and 
floor. He had great height 
during his floor routine, and 
pumped his fist after sticking 
his dismount.

“Floor, I consider that my 

strongest event so I don’t 

really have any nerves there,” 
Moore said. “Before I go I take 
a deep breath and I just go into 
autopilot. To get that triple 
full stick dismount, that felt 
great.”

Michigan coach Kurt Golder 

had nothing but praise for his 
freshmen and looked forward 
to their growing involvement 
as the season progresses.

“About a third of the routines 

today were from freshmen and 
that number will probably go 
up as Jake and Cameron Bock 
recover from their surgeries 
that they had either over the 
summer or recently,” Golder 
said “And yeah, we’re going 

to be counting 
on them a real 
lot.”

Both 
Bock 

and 
Moore 

competed 
in 

a 
combined 

seven 
events 

and 
got 
a 

taste 
of 
the 

collegiate 
atmosphere.

“It 
was 

really fun,” Moore said. “You 
know, I wanted to kind of come 
out here and get the season 
started, just have a good time, 
and I think we did that.”

Though 
Oklahoma 
beat 

Michigan down the stretch 
due to strong performances 
on the parallel bars and the 
high bar, the Wolverines were 
pleased at how they competed.

“I think last year we were 

kind of lacking that energy as 
a team, you know,” Moore said. 
“I think this season’s going to 
be a lot different and we’re 
going to show some people 
what Michigan’s made of.”

If 
the 
Wolverines 
can 

continue 
to 
work 
hard 

and 
make 
the 
necessary 

improvements on the parallel 
bars and the high bar, this 
pair of freshmen will have 
the opportunity to announce 
themselves to the rest of the 
country.

Three days to learn: Inside Michigan’s game preparation

On average, a college basketball 

team gets three or four days 
between games.

Three or four days to process 

the last game, get better, learn 
everything there is to know about 
the next opponent, teach it to the 
players, travel if the game is on the 
road, then go out and play. That’s 
a hefty order, especially when 
players have classes to attend.

This is how the Michigan 

women’s basketball team pulls it 
off.

***
The process starts at the 

beginning of the season. Coach 
Kim Barnes Arico and assistants 
Melanie Moore, Wes Brooks 
and Joy McCorvey sit down and 
split up the opponents, with 
each assistant assigned to scout 
a number of teams. From there, 
video coordinator Emma Golen 
— with the help of graduate 
assistants and student managers 
— gets to work.

Golen’s job is perhaps the most 

exhaustive of anybody employed 
by the program. Her title is video 
coordinator and, while she does 
put together film, Golen also 
helps compile scouting reports 
and track internal stats that 
determine how the team spends 
its time. She carries a binder that 
could be generously estimated 
at four inches thick, filled with 
numbers of every kind and sorted 
by tabs marking each game the 
Wolverines 
have 
played 
this 

season.

“The coaches will get this after 

the game,” Golden said, opening 
the binder. “They’ll get our lineup 
efficiencies. … All the lineups 
that were in the game, their plus/
minus, and then individually who 
was the best plus/minus. Then 
they’ll get a defensive efficiency. 
So the different defenses we were 
in, how well the opponent shot 
off of that, that type of defense, 
as well as a points per possession 
and their turnover percentage. 
And then our offensive efficiency. 

So the plays we ran, how we shot 
out of them.”

That’s not all. There are also 

individual shot charts for each 
player, 
breaking 
down 
their 

percentages from each spot on 
the floor, coded green and red 
based on how the player shot 
compared to the national average. 
Michigan’s offense and defense is 
split up by the type of possession 
— for example, transition — with 
numbers grading the Wolverines’ 
efficiency in such a situation.

This allows Michigan to self-

scout, finding its own tendencies 
and problems to fix after each 
game.

“I’ll do a lot (of self-scouting), 

just kind of what went well, what 
didn’t go well, did we run plays 
right, did we kinda follow the 
game plan,” Golen said. “Before 
games, Coach will have her goals 
for the game up there, so just 
kinda seeing if how we performed 
matched up with those goals and 
finding just little ways that we 
can improve and be better.”

Golen compiles much of this 

information during games, using 
an iPad app, SportsCode, to 
manually track the outcomes of 
individual plays. Not only can she 
record individual players, tapping 
a headshot of junior center Hallie 
Thome and then 
marking whether 
a shot was made 
or missed; Golen 
follows outcomes 
of specific sets 
and how they do 
against 
specific 

defenses. 
After 

the game, the data 
automatically 
links up with the 
game film.

The 
Wolverines 
also 
use 

Synergy, an analytics service, to 
find uber-specific stats.

“For like post moves, it splits 

up left block, right block and flash 
middle,” Golen said. “And then 
it’ll give the times that (players) 
turn left, times that they turned 
right, and when they turned left 
… a hook shot, an up-and-under, 

a drop step, the number of times 
they do that. And they break it 
down into percentages.”

Michigan uses self-scouting 

and data, in part, 
to 
figure 
out 

how 
to 
spend 

practice time. For 
example, 
after 

losing in overtime 
at home to then-
No. 8 Ohio State 
— a game they 
had a chance to 
win in regulation 
— the Wolverines 
practiced 
with 

a renewed focus on late-game 
situations.

“We spent a (lot of) time, end 

of game situations, making sure — 
not necessarily the right lineups 
that were in but everybody 
kinda felt comfortable playing 
with everyone in those kinda 
situations,” Golen said.

“Comfort in knowing your 

teammates, getting familiar with 
your teammates, making sure you 
know the plays, first of all. It’s 
different on the sidelines versus 
doing it in practice. And then next 
step, doing it in a game. There’s 
a (lot of) layers to kinda finally 
being able to be on the floor and 
do it right.”

At the beginning of the season, 

Golen was talking to a Synergy 
employee 
who 
told 
her 
an 

astounding number: 90 percent 
of Division I conference games 
in 2016-17 were decided by five 
points or less.

“So we kinda get in the 

discussion, like, your season 
comes down to maybe 30-50 
possessions that can win or lose 
you a game,” Golen said. “So with 
that comes BLOBs (baseline out 
of bounds plays), SLOBs (sideline 
out of bounds plays), and after the 
Ohio State game, we pretty much 
built into every practice was 
BLOBs, SLOBs.”

Between that loss to the 

Buckeyes and a win against them 
nine days later in Columbus, 
the Wolverines also focused on 
stopping Ohio State point guard 
Kelsey Mitchell, who dropped 39 
points in the first matchup.

“It was really important for 

(senior 
forward 

Jillian Dunston) 
to kinda see how 
(Mitchell) scored 
on her,” Golen 
said. “How she 
was able to kinda 
get in her comfort 
zone a little bit 
towards the end 
of the game and 
how she kinda 
took 
over 
that 

fourth quarter and overtime. For 
Jill and our whole team to be able 
to see that, (because) obviously 
it’s not just Jill’s responsibility 
to stop her. And just being able 
to bring that to the next game 
and improve on that and we were 
able to hold her under control the 
second game.”

That they did. Mitchell scored 

a comparatively-low 20 points on 
5-of-14 shooting from the field 
the second time around, and the 
Buckeyes fell short.

While fixing its own problems, 

Michigan is also, of course, 
preparing for the opponent itself.

***
As soon as the Wolverines are 

done playing a game scouted by a 

certain assistant, Golen starts to 
feed the assistant information 
about 
their 
next 
scout: 
a 

preliminary 
report, 
compiled 

through Synergy, detailing the 
team’s tendencies.

Some opponents will stick 

to those tendencies no matter 
what. Others mix it up, trying 
to find something that will work 
against the Wolverines. Iowa, 
for example, threw a triangle-
and-two defense at Michigan, 
putting its offense out of whack 
in what ended up being a 10-point 
Hawkeye win.

Since then, more opponents 

have flashed the triangle-and-
two at them — and the Wolverines 
have practiced going against it 
every day.

“That was the first time a league 

opponent did it and I think it kind 
of shook us a little bit,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think since that time, 
we’ve gotten better and we’ve 
practiced more and we’re moving 
the basketball better on the 
offensive end. So I think it’s been 
a combination of it being thrown 
at us and our players improving as 
the season progresses.”

The end product comes in the 

form of a booklet, given to Barnes 
Arico, featuring detailed play-by-

play diagrams, a 
page of sets run 
by the upcoming 
opponent, 
the 

opponents’ recent 
box scores, best 
rebounders, 
3-point shooters, 
and 
free-throw 

shooters (as well 
as the worst free-
throw shooters).

In 
addition 

to a recently compiled scouting 
report, Barnes Arico will go 
through booklets from prior years 
as well. She finds it to be useful 
exercise, even if there has been a 
coaching or system change.

“Kids have tendencies,” Barnes 

Arico said. “So that’s the biggest 
thing in your preparation, is can 
you get ready for their tendencies? 
You know, and there might be a 
total different style of play, but if 
you can, you know, ‘Hey, this kid’s 
gonna pull up when they go left. 
This kid’s gonna try to go all the 
way when they go right.’ So you 
can practice those things.”

The scouting report is given to 

the players themselves through 
team-distributed iPads, on the 

app Just Play.

“That has all the scouts on 

there, all the film on there, player 
tendency, film, full-game film,” 
Golen said. “So kinda whatever 
they need, they have access to as 
well.”

While the assistant coaches 

are working on a given opponent 
well beforehand, players aren’t 
given this information until that 
opponent is up next. But that 
doesn’t mean they aren’t being 
prepared.

“I can incorporate some of 

those things in practice without 
them knowing,” Barnes Arico 
said. “So if we’re gonna play 
against an offense that we’ve 
never played against before, we 
only have one or two days to prep 
for it because of our schedule, I 
can incorporate that a little bit 
earlier. Or, like, press break stuff. 
So, if we incorporate that five 
minutes every day in practice, 
when we’re getting ready for a 
press break, we’re already used to 
doing that. But for the kids, they 
don’t know it until the last game 
is over.”

When it comes to film study, 

the coaches meet to decide what 
gets shown to the entire team.

“A lot gets shown to us that 

doesn’t get shown to them, 
because there’s just not that 
much time and the focus on that 
too,” Barnes Arico said. “So we’ll 
take probably five or six clips per 
individual player.”

On one day, Michigan will 

watch film as a team. The next, 
the Wolverines will split into 
groups, the specifics of which 
often vary.

“We’ll do some groups in terms 

of position,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And we can do groups in terms 
of the Maize team and the Blue 
team. So we try to vary it, so it’s 
different learning styles, can pick 
things up differently. Different 
voices among the group are good 
to learn with.”

Like learning the scouting 

report, 
players 
are 
also 

responsible for watching film 
at home on their iPads. By 
gametime, it’s on them to know 
everything 
from 
which 
way 

their matchup prefers to drive, to 
which plays will work against the 
opposing defense.

When the ball tips, Golen 

opens her iPad and gets to work. 
It’s time to start the process all 
over again.

Tech takes a seat 

in Ann Arbor


I

f I have one hope for 2018 — besides 
finishing 
school, 
graduating, 

figuring out life and finding my 

bigger purpose in this world — it’s to drink 
better coffee than I did last year.

Since I am coming to the final pages of 

this chapter of my college career, it would 
make sense for me to try “adulting” in all 
corners of my life. This includes the music 
I listen to, the things I eat, the things I 
say, the books I read, but also, the caffeine 
I drink. Which means putting away the 
Starbucks app and prioritizing quality 
over convenience.

There are many hidden gems in Ann 

Arbor. Like the fairy doors, there are 
some things you just don’t know until 
you do — and then, your life is changed 
forever because you can’t unsee or untaste 
pure greatness. RoosRoast isn’t really a 
secret, being voted the second best coffee 
shop in all of Michigan and sold in every 
nice grocery store in town, but it has an 

ambiance that is unlike any other cafe.

From the moment you walk into the 

oddly angled door, there’s something 
different. It smells like rich coffee beans, 
but so do most coffee shops. It’s something 
about the way the bright yellow wall paint 
lights up the room — who would have 
thought bright yellow paint could look 
something other than ugly? It actually 
lights up the entire interior and makes me 
smile from the inside.

I haven’t tried all of their roasts or 

teas yet, but it’s on my to-do list. The 
chai bomb is one of my favorite drinks 
so far. It’s something like a dirty chai 
without artificial sweetener. Sometimes I 
crave it so much, I’ll walk across campus 
to get one for the afternoon. Of course, 
the drip brews and espresso drinks are 
delicious. The “Bad Ass Women Blend” 
has this verticality to the flavor with fruity 
undertones; I sound like a snob, but even 
my amateur tongue can taste the depth. 

Tea drinkers, the turmeric ginger tea will 
soothe your anxiety and stress.

When you sit at their bar or at one of 

their tables, you start to forget you’re 
in Ann Arbor. It feels like Portland or 
Brooklyn or somewhere I’d like to be a 
freelance writer working on a new book 
— the romanticized part of the life of an 
artist I imagine, or take away from indie 
films. The colorful paintings, the sign 
“Welcome Badass Women,” the floating 
lobster, the hand-drawn logos. It’s buzzing 
with conversation and new ideas.

Beanies and beards and tie-dye shirts; 

it’s quirky like that. The names of the 
coffee beans and coffee bag covers are also 
creations of John Roos, the founder and 
owner. A native of Ann Arbor, Roos is an 
entrepreneur and artist. People and places 
from his life inspire his coffee roasts: Rich 
French Neighbor, A-A Cowboy, Portland in 
the 90s.

It has this personal, welcoming vibe. I 

hate the word “vibe,” it’s out of character 
for me. But honestly, it’s the only way 
I can describe it. Or by saying, “Go to 
RoosRoast” and you’ll get it.

I find myself getting annoyed at coffee 

shops on campus when all I overhear is 
the same break-up stories over and over. 
Inevitably, going to coffee chains seem to 
attract people of similar demographics, 
similar conversations and less diversity 
of thought — it becomes redundant to 
the dozens of coffee shops within a 
certain walking radius of campus. I get 
disappointed when people go to coffee 
shops without ordering a drink and 
taking tablespace. From what I can tell at 
RoosRoast, though, people are here for the 
experience. They come for the coffee, for 
the food, for the atmosphere. And stay for 
the taste, the energy, the vibe — at least, I 
know I do. It’s one of the coffee shops with 
the largest diversity of age, gender, color 
and everything in between.

Sure, the music may be too distracting 

if you are a regular library-goer or 
want to read in silence. I usually 
compartmentalize my work and choose 
where I study accordingly. I have trouble 
thinking about cell biology when I’m 
surrounded by artists and music and talk 
about renewable energies in downtown 
Detroit. But when I write or choreograph 
or compose, I like being in stimulating 
environments. It helps to be surrounded by 
other creative energies, to feel like you’re 
not pushing boundaries and imagining the 
unimaginable alone — it’s non-judgmental 
and tastes like possibility.

The baristas and staff are friendly, and 

it would make sense that they attract a 
similar crowd. I feel like it takes a certain 
type of person to say, “I want the Lobster 
Butter Love.”

If your New Year’s resolution had 

something to do with better coffee, here’s 
a good place start.

On their website, they write: “We are 

the home of Lobster Butter Love and 
highly caffeinated, freaky people who love 
coffee. You could call us drug dealers, but 
we deal in good vibes, and yes, caffeine. It’s 
not just a business, it’s a lifestyle. We roast 
coffee, we sell coffee, we make art.”

Soundtracking: A Voice Crack

W

hy? Why would you betray 
me like this?

I trusted you. I gave 

you my everything, and you went and 
pulled this shitake mushrooms? 

We all know voice cracking isn’t 

incredibly uncommon. It happens to 
the best of us. Even the best voices to 
ever grace our ears hit speed bumps 
every now and then. I bet some nights 
when he’s unwinding and getting 
ready for bed, Morgan Freeman lets 
a crack slip into conversation. If the 
king of voiceovers himself can let 
his inner 13-year-old out, I should be 
allowed to let my voice crack once in 
awhile.

But no. For some reason, I am 

held to a higher standard than 
Freeman. By some unfounded logic, 
Matthew Harmon is not allowed to 
sneak in a voice crack without an 
incomprehensible amount of judgment 
falling upon his shoulders.

We can all agree puberty was a 

female dog. Whoever paints puberty as 
a time of beautiful blossoming can take 
a long walk off a short pier.

Yes I’m Changing — Tame Impala
During my freshman year of high 

school, my voice was squeaking more 
than a rickety floorboard. I couldn’t 
stop it. Every time I opened my mouth, 
my voice tried to do gymnastics, 
flipping 
around 
and 
eventually 

crashing and burning. However, in 
this tumultuous time, I wasn’t alone: 
Almost everyone was in the same boat. 
Kids were accidentally hitting Michael 
Jackson high notes left and right.

But in my 20s, I am alone. No 

solidarity for the occasional squeak 
when it comes out of a 20-year-old.

Let’s set the scene. Huge lecture 

hall. Over 200 students staring at a 
screen, iClickers poised and ready 
to fire at a moment’s notice, some 
diligently taking notes and others 
trying desperately to stay awake.

I am of the latter cohort.
I wasn’t trying to doze off. It’s never 

my intention, but sometimes numbers 
just lull me to sleep. I was never a 
math or science person (which kind 
of explains why I’m spending my free 
time writing this column) so whenever 
mathematic 
mumbo-jumbo 
like 

logarithms and parabolas start getting 
thrown around, you can guarantee 
I just bought a one-way ticket to 
Snoozeville.

Boredom — Tyler, the Creator
If you had seen my face, you would 

have been bored just by the transitive 
property 
(that’s 
some 
geometry 

knowledge for you, you’re welcome). 

Everything was in one ear and right 
out the other for me. Though my eyes 
were open and the lights were on, no 
one was home.

If you’ve stuck with this column 

for this long (which at this point 
is probably just my mom and the 
Statement editors), there’s something 
you should know about me. I get the 
worst 
second-hand 
embarrassment 

of anyone I know. If someone told me 
to run around in the street screaming 
“September” by Earth, Wind, and Fire, 
I’d probably do it in a heartbeat, but sit 
me down in front of someone else doing 
the same thing, you’ll see me squirm 
and avert my eyes. I can’t explain it but 
it’s the gospel truth.

The worst is when a professor asks a 

question and has the audacity to wait 
for someone to answer. If we don’t 
know, we won’t raise our hand. It’s 
as simple as that. However, I’d rather 
be outwardly wrong than sit in that 
professor-induced awkward moment. 
So when the professor in this lecture 
asked a question and no one wanted to 
answer, I knew what had to be done.

Someone had to be a hero and say 

something.

Something — The Beatles
This was my moment. I was about to 

step into my supersuit. The entire class 
would lift me up and parade me out of 
the lecture hall for having saved them 
from the silence. I was ready to shine.

Did I know the answer? No.
Did I care? Not at all.
Everything 
happened 
in 
slow 

motion. My hand crept into the air. I 
saw my professor’s face light up. His 
arm reached out and pointed at me. I 
think he was more so shocked that I 
was even willing to speak. He knew 
I wasn’t in the mood for numbers but 
I guess he thought I was giving it the 
good old college try.

“Yes, you in the back!” the professor 

said.

I was ready. I opened my mouth, 

ready to B.S. harder than I ever have 
before, but instead of some meaningless 
mathematical jargon, a tiny peep 
echoed across the room.

Frick me. 
How Could This Happen to Me? — 

Simple Plan

“I try to make a sound but no one 

hears me.”

In all my years of living, I had never 

seen more heads dart towards me at 
once until that day. Every single person 
in that lecture hall heard my vocal 
throwback to middle school. The entire 
purpose of me raising my hand was to 
break the silence, and break the silence 
I did.

What did I do to deserve this fate? 

I’m just an average dude. I pay my taxes 
when applicable. I sometimes hold the 
door for people assuming they aren’t 
too far away for it to be inconvenient. 
I do that little white person jog across 
the street when a car is waiting to turn.

Why do bad things happen to 

mediocre people?

I wanted to just click my heels and 

magically be hundreds of miles away 

from that lecture hall seat.

No Place Left to Hide — Jessica 

Hernandez and the Deltas

Have you ever seen those ostrich 

pillows where you can lay on your 
desk with your entire head covered 
by comfort? I wanted to bury myself 
10 feet under. I couldn’t even answer 
the professor’s question. He waited 
patiently again but I was just silent.

Then the waiting began again. The 

endless waiting.

I had failed. I let my class down but 

somehow — more importantly — I let 
myself down.

When duty called, my voice box kept 

me from realizing my true potential. 
Instead of being championed by the 
class like Rudy after the last play, I left 
class with my head hung low.

Death with Dignity — Sufjan 

Stevens

Shame. It’s a thing we feel from 

time to time. But we learn from our 
mistakes. We move forward, endlessly 
striving for better days. Did I learn 
anything this time around? Yes.

I learned to shut my fricking mouth 

or else middle school Matt is going 
to make an incredibly unsolicited 
appearance. 

The best we can do in times like 

these is recognize your place in this 
world and laugh. And sometimes write 
a column about it.

Tech takes a seat in Ann Arbor

I

n October 2017, Duo Security 
— an Ann Arbor-based com-
pany, launched by two Uni-
versity of Michigan alumni in 

2009 — made national headlines when 
it secured a $70 million round of fund-
ing that brought it to be valued at over 
$1 billion dollars; the information tech-
nology startup is known for producing 
two-factor authentication systems.

“Ann Arbor is our home,” Dug Song, 

one of Duo Security’s founders, said in 
an October interview with TechCrunch. 
“With more than 350 employees based 
here, we’re proud of our Michigan roots 
and our heritage of global cybersecurity 
innovation in Southeastern Michigan. 
The region has a wellspring of talent 
that we will continue to invest in and 
hire from, and attract talent from out-
side the state as well.”

Duo is at the forefront of a fledgling 

wave of early-stage technology startups 
that have chosen to take root not in the 
San Francisco and East Coast technol-
ogy hubs, but within Metro Detroit.

As of 2016, there were 49 active 

venture-based startups in Ann Arbor, 
according to the Michigan Venture 
Capital Association Annual Research 
Report. These companies represent 35 
percent of startups in the state, and are 
are primarily split between information 
technology and life sciences sectors, 
with the remainder scattered across 
advanced manufacturing and energy.

In 
December 
2017, 
VentureBeat 

described Ann Arbor as one of four 
emerging national tech hubs, alongside 
much-larger Pittsburgh, Indianapolis 
and Raleigh, N.C.

“Given that there are currently 112 pri-

vately held unicorn companies in the U.S., 
it’s impressive that Ann Arbor — with a 
population of just 120,000 — managed to 
cultivate one,” VentureBeat wrote.

What draws entrepreneurs to Ann 

Arbor are elements of a strong entre-
preneurial community, a large research 
institution and the fact that more than 
half of the venture capital firms in the 
state are located in the area, according 
to Emily Heintz, associate director at 
the Michigan Venture Capital Associa-
tion.

“We 
believe 
the 
entrepreneurial 

investment community is made up of 
four things — research, capital, commu-

nity and talent,” Heintz said.

These elements, combined with the 

city’s accessible Midwestern culture 
and relatively lower cost of living, have 
begun to make Ann Arbor an appealing 
alternative to the crowded Bay Area for 
some entrepreneurs, despite a regional 
dearth in capital.
A

nn 
Arbor’s 
college-town 

atmosphere makes it easy 
for entrepreneurs to con-
nect with potential partners 

due to the educated local population, 
according to Bill Mayer, SPARK’s vice 
president for entrepreneurial services.

SPARK is the county’s publicly-

funded economic development asso-
ciation, which has taken a keen interest 
in curating the local high-tech sector. 
Its downtown Liberty Street office — 
despite a simplistic interior — serves as 
an incubator housing early-stage tech-
based startups.

In terms of what draws entrepre-

neurs to the area, Mayer explained the 
coasts are far more populated than the 
Midwest. As a result, he believes it can 
be very difficult to raise capital due to 
competition on the dense coasts. Ann 
Arbor, contrarily, is a “nice size” — a 
smaller city with 120,000 people.

“If you’re in New York or San Francis-

co, you can go to meetups and meet peo-
ple but it’s really hard to get a meeting 
on Sand Hill Road,” Mayer said, refer-
ring to Silicon Valley’s arterial road 
known for housing the world’s marquee 
venture capital funds. “It sounds like 
everything gets funded out there, but 
it’s actually quite challenging to get on 
the radar of investors out there.”

Investors know they can hire employ-

ees in Ann Arbor that won’t get stolen 
by Google or Facebook, he said. They 
can also pay these employees a compa-
rably lower wage than they would have 
to in San Francisco due to lower costs 
of living (although Ann Arbor is still 
expensive relative to its region), making 
Ann Arbor startups far more “capital 
efficient.”

Ann Arbor is also a place executives 

know their employees can thrive in, 
unlike San Francisco or Boulder, Colo.

“From an employer’s standpoint, the 

fact that your employees can actually 
buy a house is pretty amazing,” Mayer 
said.

Cash Butler, an Ann Arbor native, is 

one of many SPARK-based innovators. 
After spending several years in Boston, 
he relocated his company, ClariLegal, 
to Ann Arbor, drawn by the University 
community and lower costs. ClariLe-
gal matches corporations and law firms 
with the vendors they need to ensure 
they get the best value for their work.

“I came back because there was a 

vibrant community of innovative think-
ers and a wonderful level of talent at 
(the University of) Michigan, East-
ern Michigan, Washtenaw Community 
College that I could staff my company 
with,” he said.

Butler said he has taken advantage 

of hiring University students as interns 
and been extremely happy with the 
results. He also pointed to the relatively 
lower cost of living in addition to easier 
travel compared to the coasts.

In the future, he hopes to collaborate 

more with the University, particularly 
with alumni, to bring in people who are 
interested in software innovation for 
the legal industry.

“My biggest marketing thing is flying 

people in and taking them to a Universi-
ty of Michigan football game,” he joked.
H

owever, the Midwest still 
lacks the critical entre-
preneurial infrastructure 
that coastal tech hubs 

have, namely venture capital to fund 
early-stage companies. 

Michigan startups in particular face a 

“capital gap” in raising their necessary 
investors, according to Heintz. Most of 
the country’s venture capital funds are 
based around San Francisco and the 
financial hubs of New York and Bos-
ton. As a result, many new Midwestern 
tech companies need to leave their geo-
graphic home to raise funding.

As associate director of the MVCA, 

Heintz represents the 33 venture capi-
tal funds in Michigan, 18 of which are 
based in Ann Arbor as of 2016, accord-
ing to the MVCA report.

Of the 49 active venture-backed start-

ups in Ann Arbor in 2016, 25 received 
more than $101 million from venture 
capital firms in 2016, according to the 
MVCA report. Of course, this is a tiny 
slice compared to the $69 billion raised 
in funding across the U.S. in 2016.

Midwestern investors also tend to be 

more conservative than those on the 
West Coast, according to Mayer. This 
makes it more difficult for an early-
stage company to raise funds; however, 
this means the Midwestern startups 
that ultimately receive a vote of con-
fidence are generally lower-risk than 
something that would get funded in 
California.

“The good news about that is that the 

companies that do get funded here tend 
to have a higher survival rate,” Mayer 
said. “On the other hand, from an entre-
preneur’s standpoint, sometimes it can 
be harder to raise capital, because inves-
tors typically look for more achieved 
milestones, more business results, ver-
sus just kind of pitching a concept.”

Heintz said it is crucial to have a 

robust foundation of capital in Michi-
gan — which currently the overwhelm-
ing majority comes from out-of-state 
— in order to fund new companies. 
According to the MVCA report, every 
dollar invested in a Michigan startup by 
a Michigan venture capital firm attracts 
$4.61 of investment from outside of 
Michigan.

“On one hand that’s good because it’s 

more money coming into the state, but 
on the other hand it’s something that 
you do want to worry about because you 
want CEOs and founders to be able to 
focus on their companies and not have 
to always fly around the country look-
ing for capital,” Heintz said.

Recently, more startups are choosing 

to remain in the area, Mayer explained. 
He said 15 years ago, people would be 
able to raise money in Ann Arbor, but 
then when it was time for them to raise 
follow-on capital, they would find an 
out-of-state investor that would often 
stipulate they would need to relocate to 
California.

Today, this doesn’t happen as much, 

largely because San Francisco has 
become so costly, competitive and over-
crowded.

“There’s so much competition for all 

of the employees (in San Francisco),” 
he said. “There are people paying over 
$100 per square foot for office space. 
You can pay $15 or $20 per square foot 
here. So investors do the math.”

T

he University of Michigan’s 
research and human capital 
contribute heavily to the 
entreprenurial 
appeal 
of 

Ann Arbor. When Mayer began work-
ing at SPARK, he was surprised to learn 
only about 20 to 30 percent of the com-
panies SPARK works with originate 
from the University of Michigan.

Nonetheless, he said the University 

serves as a key catalyst to successful 
entrepreneurial activity — conducting 
$1.5 billion of federally-funded research 
each year, the largest research funding 
budget of any public university in the 
nation. Some of this research translates 
into commercial application and can be 
licensed directly to industry — that, or a 
startup can sometimes spin off.

“The good news about the Univer-

sity companies is that the potential 
of those companies tends to be very 
high, because almost always they have 
some kind of high (intellectual prop-
erty), they have patents, they have mil-
lions and millions of dollars of federal 
research already done,” he said.

In the private sector, startups launch 

outside of large research institutions 
and depend on competitions and grants; 
student startups often fall into this cate-
gory. In general, one advantage to start-
ing up in Ann Arbor, Mayer explained, 
is the close proximity to University 
experts and departments available for 
collaboration.

Clinc, located in downtown Ann 

Arbor, builds conversational AI soft-
ware that was based on the work of the 
University’s Clarity Lab. Their work 
builds on the research conducted in 
Clarity Lab, directed by Jason Mars 
and Lingjia Tang, assistant professor 
of computer science at the University. 
Hauswald and alum Michael Lorenzano 
worked with Mars and Tang as doctoral 
students, and all four are co-founders of 
the company. Clinc raised at least $7.5 
million in a funding round as of early 
2017, according to Crain’s Detroit Busi-
ness.

The dark interior of the Clinc office 

compliments the view of downtown 
Ann Arbor in the winter. On a Friday 
afternoon, instead of already leaving 
for the weekend, they were hard at work 
— in meetings in a glass-walled confer-
ence room and scrutinizing code while 
hunched over their desktops.

Johann Hauswald, co-founder and 

chief architect at the company, is a 
three-time University graduate. Haus-
wald is the perfect representation of 
his company — laid back and casual, but 
extremely astute — a description deno-
tative of Silicon Valley.

One of the team’s objectives was to 

examine intelligent personal assistants 
like Siri — to find out how the technol-
ogy was built and then insert it into cus-
tomer-facing apps.

The team ultimately created their own 

intelligent personal assistant software. 
Now, companies can adopt the technolo-
gy and personalize it to their domain so 
their customers can communicate with 
a more customized assistant.

One area the software is particularly 

helpful in is banking, demonstrated by 
Hauswald as he opened his banking app 
and asked his phone how much money 
he had spent on food in Ann Arbor in 
the past month. The virtual assistant 
responded with an amount and the 
screen presented a report.

Hauswald explained Mars and Tang 

could have moved their entire research 
lab to Stanford University to take advan-
tage of the nearby investors.

“It sounds attractive, but from our 

perspective, we had this tight connec-
tion to the University, there’s this whole 
research lab of Ph.D. students that are 
at the University,” he said. “Ann Arbor 
is an awesome city, it’s cheaper. There 
is a lot of tech in downtown Ann Arbor, 
and also in Michigan in general.”
S

tartup ventures are a risky 
business and not all of them 
are met with success, and this 
is no different in Michigan.

Cribspot began as a class project by 

University of Michigan Business under-
graduates, but ultimately launched as 
a property management startup in late 
2013. By summer 2014, the company had 
raised $660,000 in investment, primar-
ily from Michigan-based venture capi-
talists. 

Cribspot compiles and crowdsources 

off-campus housing options for stu-
dents, and grew to include over 100,000 
users at 175 schools as of early 2018.

“It’s actually a really growing com-

munity of startups in Ann Arbor and 
Detroit,” Cribspot co-founder Jason 
Okrasinski told The Daily in 2014. 
“There’s maybe a handful of startups, 
so it’s a tightknit community and all 
together, it’s just a really great place to 
start a business and really start to grow 
it.”

Yet four years later, The Daily report-

ed Cribspot is expected to quietly shut-
ter its Ann Arbor operations.

A former Cribspot employee, who 

asked to remain anonymous, told The 
Daily in early January the company 
leaders couldn’t agree upon a direction 
for the company, suggesting this caused 
its operations to be economically unsus-
tainable. 

“Essentially what happened — to the 

best of my knowledge — is that the com-
pany was kind of going in two differ-
ent directions, one more tech-oriented 
and the other more concerned with the 
physical business of Ann Arbor hous-
ing management,” he said. “With this in 
mind, it was starting to look less feasi-
ble for the latter to continue functioning 
if the company was to follow these two 
separate paths.”

Meanwhile, back at the Clinc offic-

es, Hauswald said the company has no 
desire to relocate from Michigan.

“Never at any point did we think we 

have to move to California in order to 
make this work,” Hauswald said. “We 
did get sort of hints from investors — 
like, ‘If you want to be a successful 
startup, you have to go the Valley.’”

According to Hauswald, finding talent 

and engineers has never been a problem 
for Clinc. He added, however, business 
executives don’t necessarily live in the 
area. To overcome this issue, companies 
needs to be able to have people working 
remotely, and be able to pay them.

Like Butler, Hauswald noted Clinc 

hires many student interns, many of 
whom come from West Coast schools 
like Stanford University and the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley.

“They are coming and applying to us 

for internships,” he said. “They don’t 
necessarily think of location, they think, 
‘What are the interesting problems?’”

Connor Borrego, a serial entrepreneur 

and 2017 LSA graduate that currently 
works in product marketing at a local 
startup, said the geographic expansion 
of the tech industry would be a socially 
beneficial long-term trend.

“I think there’s a lot of concentration 

of wealth and talent and education on 
the coasts of this country, and I think it 
has lead to a silo of communities across 
the country,” Borrego said. “By spread-
ing the talent, spreading the wealth out 
across the country, I think you’ll do a 
much better service to democracy as a 
whole.”

I 

got a text from my mom on a 
hot, busy afternoon in July. 
Of course, all of your July 

afternoons are hot and busy when 
you spend so much time taking care 
of 7-year-olds that you almost have 
no time to take care of yourself. The 
text read, “Call Dad. It’s important.”

My Nana had been sick for years. 

Ovarian cancer is a relentless battle, 
one that she had both lost and 
conquered gracefully. I braced myself 
for the news as I dialed the number, 
subtly noting that there really is no 
such thing as “bracing yourself.”

But the news my dad broke to me 

over the phone, as I stood alone in the 
woods getting eaten by mosquitos, 
wasn’t the death of my grandmother. 
It was my dog — a victim of cancer 

as well. Boomer was put to sleep that 
same evening. I wasn’t going to make 
it home from camp in time to bid him 
a formal goodbye, so Facetime had to 
suffice.

I shed tears on the screen of my 

iPhone and felt real loss for the first 
time in my life.

I felt something else too, though. 

Something so strange I wasn’t sure I 
could even talk about it: relief. I was 
relieved that it wasn’t my grandma. 
Emotions are complex and hard 
to decipher. Sometimes we simply 
can’t comprehend them. Sometimes 
they’re too overwhelming and the 
dissonance is too discomforting that 
all we can do is push them aside and 
continue to live our lives.

And that’s exactly what I did. 

I finished the summer with an 
acute 
sense 
of 
accomplishment 

and tried to reflect on everything 
I learned: taking care of kids is 99 
percent instinct, takes 100 percent 
commitment and energy, but is one of 
the most gratifying things I’ve ever 
done. I learned that the innocence of a 
7-year-old girl with so many mistakes 
to make and so much to learn still 
ahead of her is both refreshing and 
nostalgic. It made me wonder what I 
would do differently if I were in her 
shoes and could do it all again.

Life after camp seemed to revolve 

around only one thing: college. It was 
hard to breathe with the omnipresent 
weight of the future on my shoulders. 
It was supposed to be an exciting 
time for me, but the thought of 

leaving the people and places that 
watched me grow up stung a little. 
And the thought of everyone who had 
weathered the last four years with 
me moving on to a new life scared me 
most of all. 

Amid of all my end-of-the-summer 

activities, I got a call, this time, from 
my mom. My response was, “You’re 
telling me this over the phone?”

So I got in the car and drove home 

in violent sobs, almost pulling over at 
one point to throw up on the side of 
Woodward Avenue.

The next day we were on a plane 

to New York. It was good to see my 
dad’s family. And it was good for my 
dad to see my dad’s family. I learned, 
that week, that everyone handles 
grief differently; the prescribed five

How Did I Get Here?

BY SYDNEY LAUB, CONTRIBUTOR


stages aren’t necessarily the same 
for everyone.

I also learned that the anticipation 

of death doesn’t make it hurt any 
less. You can try to imagine what 

life will be like when someone is 
gone, in a morbid sort of attempt to 
prepare yourself. But when you get 
the call, when the finality sets in, it 
doesn’t matter how long you spent 
preparing, or how many times you 
said goodbye. It hits you hard and 
hurts all the same.

I spent too much time thinking 

about death that week, trying to 
figure it all out until I decided that 
you can’t “figure it all out.” 

I came home and enjoyed what was 

left of my summer. I said too many 
goodbyes and then moved to East 
Lansing and tried my hardest to feel 
OK about everything. I set a picture 
of Boomer on my desk and slipped 
one of Nana’s rings onto my finger, 
and moved forward.

I fell into a routine: wake up, 

exercise, class, homework, sleep. On 
the weekends I went out. Hangover. 
It got old fast. I tried to construct 
meaning out of things that I knew 
meant nothing to me. I made new 
friends and I missed my old friends. 
The ex-relationship ensued. The 
silence 
was 
both 
peaceful 
and 

deafening. I kept reminding myself 
that it would get better. Change is 
hard, but it just takes time, right? It 
felt like I was losing at some arbitrary 
game. Who was I losing to, though? 
Myself? I looked at old pictures too 
often. I was homesick.

I 
found 
joy 
in 
little 
things, 

though. Like the walk down the path 
behind my dorm to the Starbucks 
in 
Michigan 
State’s 
College 
of 

Business, and Friday morning runs 
around campus with a new friend. I 
learned about things that interested 
me and had long phone calls with my 

parents. I became more observant 
of everyone and everything around 
me. I learned that change and fresh 
independence inherently comes with 
loss, but that’s OK.

The last time I heard from my dad 

was Tuesday, Nov. 8. I texted him 
on Wednesday. No response. And 
again on Thursday. I said, “What’s 
going on with the stock market?” I 
was expecting some paragraph about 
the economy that I didn’t totally 
understand, ending in “everything 
will be OK.” He was always like that 
— making me feel safe. No response. 
I didn’t think much of it.

My mom told me on Friday. I had 

just gotten home from chemistry 
lecture and I was sitting in my bed 
drinking Teavana orange tea. My 
grandparents were already almost 
at my dorm to pick me up, she told 
me. And I remember asking my 
roommate if I needed to bring home 
black tights for the funeral.

I remember the first week he was 

gone through a blurry, tear-stained 
lens; I was drowning in a tsunami of 
grief. I wasn’t angry, just in shock. 
After the funeral, we flew back to 
New York and broke the earth next 
to Nana. I felt my heart shatter into 
a million pieces inside my chest and 
wondered if it would ever feel whole 
again.

It felt hard to breathe for a while 

after that. It still does sometimes. 
My dad has been dead for over a year 
now.

I found out later that my brother 

was supposed to stay at my dad’s 
house on Thursday night — the night 
before we found out. So he drove 
over there, but he forgot his key. He 
knocked and no one answered, so he 
left.

It’s funny how the world works 

like that. It’ll take away your dad, 
but protect you from what’s behind 

the locked door. Somehow it meant 
everything and nothing all at once; 
I had nothing left to learn, except 
everything.

When you lose someone too young, 

too suddenly, you also lose a future 
you were supposed to have. You’re 
left with all these things that were 
supposed to happen and now they 
won’t, they can’t. So without a 
choice, we adjust the plan, we accept 
the cards we’re dealt and we try our 
best.

We try to figure everything out. 

We grieve. We cry. We pick up the 
shattered pieces, slowly. And we 
try, desperately, to make sense of 
everything, even when it doesn’t 
make sense.

I really don’t know what I believe 

in anymore. I don’t know if there’s 
a God or afterlife or fairness. But I 
know it’s harder to believe in nothing 
at all.

Slowly, time will fill parts of 

what’s empty now. The thought 
of loving something so much and 
having it taken away from me again 
terrifies me. But the only thing that 
scares me more than the potential 
for loss is having nothing to lose.

Sometimes, I think about the 

person I was one year ago when 
my 
world 
was 
shaken 
and 
I 

questioned everything. Sometimes, 
I can’t believe that person was me. 
Sometimes, I wonder how I got here: 
I go to a different school, my hair is 

less curly and blonder, I still bite my 
nails and question everything, my 
ears are studded with faux diamonds, 
I don’t drink orange tea anymore. I 
know less about sports than I used to 
and more about health care in Haiti 
and still have no idea who I am.

But here’s what I’ve learned from 

this:

My dad, along with so many others, 

wasn’t 
particularly 
deserving 
of 

what he got. My dad died because 

his veins stopped pumping blood to 
his heart. It was a side effect of his 
anatomy. It was an unlucky, random 
stroke of fate.

We don’t really have control over 

a lot of things that happen in this 
life, but we do have control over how 
we choose to deal with them. After 
you get the call, after the earthquake 
cracks the ground beneath you, who 
will you be in the aftermath? That’s 
when we get to choose.

Maybe the memories will always 

invade my dreams and I’ll always 
see him in crowded rooms, having 
to remind myself it’s not him. Maybe 
I’ll always search for artifacts, for 
something tangible to hold onto, 
from the life my dad lived. I’ll wipe 
the dust off the photograph from the 
abandoned box in the basement and 
tell myself that he’s smiling like this 
somewhere.

It’s crazy to me how the days come 

and go quietly and then suddenly it’s 
a new year in a new city, strangers 
became friends and friends became 
strangers and right now I am here 
— made of all the people that have 
come and gone, all the places and 
moments that came before this.

I learned that sometimes happiness 

becomes a choice you need to make; 
you can find it in your friends and in 
your family and most importantly in 
yourself. I think I’ll always exist with 
regret and heartbreak and loss, but 
I’ll also live with health, happiness, 

love and the exciting uncertainty of 
the future.

So finally, I ask myself what I 

can do to repay the people who 
have touched me so deeply, the 
people that taught me so much, even 
though they weren’t here nearly long 
enough? What can I do with my tiny 
part of this massive whole that can 
somehow make up for them not being 
here?

Because I am here. I’m right here.
