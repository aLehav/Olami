Officials at the ACT — a 
college admissions test taken by 
more than 1.9 million students 
each year — announced a policy 
change earlier this month that 
will allow students to retake 
single sections of the five-part 
test rather than having to sit 
for the entire exam in hopes of 
improving their score. Typically, 
the test takes about three hours 
to complete. 
In an email to The Michigan 
Daily, University of Michigan 
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald 
said the University would need 
more information from ACT 
officials in order to determine the 
impact the changes will have on 
admissions policies. 
“Clarification 
from 
ACT 
regarding how test information 
will be shared and viewable 
by universities is still unclear,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 
“The 
admissions team will continue to 
monitor this situation as policies 
are shared and make changes to 
the process where appropriate.”
The 
change 
comes 
amid 
concerns 
over 
testing-based 

anxiety, 
the 
importance 
of 
standardized testing and its 
role 
in 
perpetuating 
social 
inequities. Critics of the change 
worry 
it 
will 
increase 
the 
role of socioeconomic status 
on performance, since those 
who come from higher-class 
backgrounds likely have more 
resources that will help them 
succeed on the exam, such as 
access to coaching and the money 
to take the exam multiple times.
For Michael Hartt, a junior 
at Grosse Pointe North High 
School, the change has relieved 
test-related anxiety.
“It 
makes 
me 
feel 
less 
apprehensive about preparing,” 
Hartt said. “I know that if I get 
a score in section that I’m not 
satisfied with, I can study for that 
single section to get my score up.”
In announcing the change, 
ACT 
leadership 
said 
a 
“superscore,” 
which 
is 
the 
culmination 
of 
the 
highest 
scores on each section of the test 
without regard to when it was 
taken to create a new composite 
score, is more indicative of how 
students will perform in college 
courses. Previously, students had 
to retake the test in full each time 
to obtain a higher score.

Three prominent multicultural 
groups — the United Asian 
American Organizations, La Casa 
and the Arab Student Association 
— at the University of Michigan 
have 
released 
statements 
condemning 
participation 
in 
Order of Angell, an exclusive 
senior honor society formerly 
known as Michigamua, due to 
the 
organization’s 
historical 
exclusivity and past appropriation 
of 
Native 
American 
culture. 
The groups announced policies 
that bar students who accept 

membership in the society from 
holding a leadership position 
within their cultural organization.
Former University President 
James Angell originally founded 
Michigamua, 
now 
Order 
of 
Angell, in 1902 to bring students 
from different corners of campus 
together and facilitate “campus 
synergy.” The current goal of 
the organization, according to 
members who spoke with The 
Daily on Friday afternoon, is to 
bring a diverse group of up to 
25 students with demonstrated 
leadership on campus together to 
better the University. 
The Order’s reputation has 
been marred by instances of 
racism in the past, specifically in 

regards to its nature of exclusivity 
and use of Native American 
rituals. 
The 
organization’s 
meeting 
space 
previously 
exhibited 
Native 
American 
statues and headdresses, and the 
room itself had a “wigwam-like” 
interior design. Michigamua also 
displayed photos of members 
taking part in Native American-
like rituals and gave members 
derogatory 
nicknames 
like 
“Squaw,” which references female 
reproductive organs.
The 
University 
banned 
Michigamua 
from 
using 
the 
seventh floor of the Michigan 
Union, 
its 
historical 
meeting 
space, 
in 
2000 
after 
native 
artifacts were discovered in the 

space and demonstratorsoccupied 
the 
area 
for 
37 
days. 
The 
University reinstated the group 
as a recognized organization in 
2007 after losing the distinction 
in 2000, and the organization 
renamed itself as Order of Angell 
the same year.
Historical documents related 
to the Order are available in the 
Bentley Historical Library on 
North Campus. According to 
itswebsite, the Order “recognizes 
the 
hurt” 
caused 
by 
using 
“co-opted 
Native 
American 
rituals” and noted the group 
does not partake in any Native 
American 
practices 
currently 
and “actively condemns” doing

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

At 
Larcom 
City 
Hall 
Monday, 
about 
50 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
and 
City 
Councilmembers 
attended 
a public meeting to discuss 
possible 
locations 
for 
monitoring 
water 
wells 
regarding the Gelman Plume. 
According to Washtenaw 
County’s 
website, 
the 
Gelman Plume is the spread 
of 
the 
contaminant 
1,4 
dioxane 
throughout 
the 
county 
groundwater 
that 
is contaminating residents’ 
drinking water. 1,4 dioxane 

is a carcinogen that, from 
1966 to 1986, the company 
Gelman 
Sciences 
used 
in 
their manufacturing process, 
in which they improperly 
disposed of their waste water.
Brian 
Steglitz, 
water 
treatment plant manager for 
Ann Arbor, opened the event 
with a quick overview and 
introductions, 
sharing 
the 
reason behind the meeting. 
“So why are we here?” 
Steglitz said. “We are here 
because we want to make sure 
that we are doing everything 
that we can to make sure 
that the city’s drinking water 
supply is protected.” 

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Mozghan 
Savabieasfahani, 
an environmental taxologist, 
told The Daily she feels Ann 
Arbor has fallen short in 
protecting its residents.
“The spirit of actual change 
(is missing),” Savabieasfahani 
said. “The city of Ann Arbor 
has miserably failed from 
protecting us and our water 
supply is contaminated. We 
want change and the urgency 
to clean it up is missing.” 
Patti 
McCall, 
associate 
geologist 
and 
professional 
wetland scientist at Tetra 
Tech, broke down the plans 
for 
the 
monitoring 
well, 

which is meant to test water 
thought 
to 
be 
untouched 
by 
1,4 
dioxane. 
If 
the 
contaminant is present, then 
the monitoring wells will 
trigger early warning signs, 
McCall said. 
McCall said the project 
is 
broken 
down 
into 
six 
phases: 
data 
collection, 
three-dimensional modeling, 
independent review, sample 
collection, 
well 
location 
recommendations and public 
engagement.

The 
National 
Academy 
of Medicine announced the 
election 
of 
100 
members 
at its annual meeting last 
Monday. Three University of 
Michigan 
faculty 
members 
are among the new class of 
members, including Rebecca 
Cunningham, James Dalton 
and Gabriel Nuñez. They join 
53 other current and emeritus 
University 
of 
Michigan 
faculty, and living former 
faculty, in the prestigious 
society.
According 
to 
the 
NAM 
website, election to NAM is 
one of the most prestigious 
recognitions in the health 
and 
medicine 
fields, 
and 
recognizes those who have 
excelled in their professions.
The 
Daily 
spoke 
to 
Cunningham, 
Dalton 
and 
Nuñez about their research in 
medicine and health.
Cunningham 
is 
the 
Interim 
Vice 
President 
of 
Research, 
Director 
of 
the 
Injury 
Prevention 
Center 
and a professor of emergency 
medicine.

Update to test allows students to retake 
single sections instead of entire exam 

When 
Atharva 
Kharkar, 
former Business sophomore at the 
University of Michigan, was told 
he had leukemia last June, he rolled 
his eyes and said with a smile on his 
face: “Honestly, life is so dramatic.”
In East Lansing five years prior, 
Alex Powell was preparing to 
begin his undergraduate career at 
Michigan State University when 
he found out he was diagnosed 
with a rare bone cancer. Though 
they have both since passed away, 
both these students legacies’ live 
on and will be honored by students 
and staff of both universities 
during Alex’s Great State Race on 
November 15.
Every year since 2013 on the 
eve of the Michigan vs. Michigan 
State 
football 
game, 
Reserve 
Officer Training Corps students 
from both colleges gear up to 
partake in a 64-mile relay race to 
deliver the ceremonious game ball. 
From 3 a.m. to 3 p.m., flights will 
trek through the almost freezing 
weather, blustering winds and 
pitch-black sky to honor Alex’s 
legacy. Though originally set up 
by Powell’s parents, this year, LSA 
senior and Army ROTC student 
Alex Zhang decided to make it 
more personal and run in honor of 
Kharkar.

On 
Monday 
evening, 
the 
Weiser 
Center 
for 
Emerging 
Democracies organized a lecture 
titled “Hegemon Risen: Turkey’s 
Emergence as an Independent 
Authoritarian 
State” 
with 
support from the Donia Human 
Rights Center, the University of 
Michigan Department of History, 
the Michigan War Studies Group 
and the International Institute. 
The audience consisted of about 
50 people, both students and 
professors. 
Michael 
Hickok, 
an 
FBI 
assistant special agent-in-charge 
in the Las Vegas Division with a 
Ph.D. in Ottoman history from 
the University, was the lecture’s 
keynote speaker.
Fatma Müge Göçek, professor 
of sociology and women’s studies, 
began the event by introducing 
Hickok’s background in Ottoman 
history and work with the FBI. 

Hickock said he conceived 
of the idea for this lecture two 
decades ago. 
“The Hegemonic Rise piece 
comes out of something I did 
approximately twenty years ago,” 
Hickok said. “I was sitting and 
doing some thinking about some 
pieces I had done previously in 
Turkey in the context of what was 
changing in Turkey in that period 
and I speculated a little on where I 
thought things were going, sitting 
in 2000.”
Hickok asserted that very little 
of what is happening in Turkish 
politics is happening for the first 
time. He mentioned a piece he 
wrote in 2001, where he analyzed 
the political and economic history 
in Northern Iraq to get a broader 
understanding of the situation. 
“In taking it back to the 
Ottoman 
times, 
through 
the 
British, through what Saddam 
was trying to do, I would suggest 
to you that the themes are very 
similar,” 
Hickok 
said. 
“The 

mistakes that we made in our 
policy, the mistakes that the 
Ottomans made, the mistakes that 
the British had made in trying to 
make an economy in Iraq.”
Hickok 
also 
contrasted 
1990s Turkey and present-day 
Turkey. He spoke about Turkey’s 
newfound willingness to invade 
other 
countries, 
which 
has 
contributed to Turkey’s rise as a 
hegemon. 
“(Turkey’s) previous strategic 
planning had been based on 
somebody else invading them,” 
Hickok said. “But they spent much 
of the 2000s, and more recently 
last week, invading other people. 
They are comfortable doing that 
in a way they would not have been 
prior to 1998.”
Hickok further emphasized 
that Turkey’s previous view as 
a bridge to get somewhere else 
and not be somewhere to go has 
changed and that this change 
in perspective has led Turkey 
to recognize itself as a regional 
power. 
“Now Turkey no longer 
sees itself as this thing 
that people use to get to 
somewhere else,” Hickok 
said. “It is, in itself, an 
independent security actor 
within the area.”
In an interview with 
The Daily after the event, 
LSA sophomore Alp Yel, 
executive board member 
of 
the 
Turkish 
Student 
Association, said he believes 
Turkey can indeed become 
a significant regional power 
in the future.
“If 
Turkey 
plays 
its 
moves right it can become 
a regional power,” Hickok 
said. “Turkey has to strike 
a balance between its own 
goals and political ties with 
its allies and neighbors.”
To conclude the lecture, 
Hickok said he believed that 
though there are changes 
coming in the future in 
regards to Turkey’s internal 
politics, 
the 
relationship 
between 
Turkey 
and 
the United States is still 
uncertain. 

“Whether in the end (these 
internal 
changes) 
bring 
us 
to a better relationship with 
Washington or whether it makes 
Turkey 
a 
more 
predictable 
security actor within the region,” 
Yel said. “I think it is something 
that has not been decided and I 
think that it is very hard right now 
from the Americans’ point of view, 
due to the nature of our relation, 
to see that. We are in a position 
where it is very hard for us to see 
what’s going on internally.”
At the end of the lecture, 
audience members were able to 
ask Hickok questions.
In response to a question 
regarding whether the change 
in Turkey’s military strategy is a 
reflection of the Ottoman legacy, 
Hickok said Turkey was almost 
semi-isolating 
the 
Ottoman 
legacy and recognizing itself as a 
Eurasian power. 
“(Turkey) is almost turning its 
back on the Ottoman tradition and 
Ottoman history,” Hickok said. “If 
anything, (Turkey) is integrating 
with the West.”
Finally, Hickok was asked how 
powers like the Moscow, Tehran 
and Baghdad reacted to Turkey’s 
assertion 
as 
an 
independent 
power as compared to the United 
States.
“So it’s been a different dynamic 
because the Russians, the Iraqis 
have had a different relationship 
with Turkey than Washington,” 
Hickok said. “So for Iraq, to see 
Turkey as an independent security 
actor is less of a concern than the 
internal issues within Iraq right 
now. So they can’t do anything 
about Turkey’s interference in 
Northern Iraq and so are more or 
less set with kind of negotiating it 
out.” 
LSA senior Selin Levi said after 
the lecture she thinks Turkey is 
indeed becoming an unpredictable 
hegemonic power.
“Turkey’s rise to a hegemonic 
power has made the future 
uncertain,” 
Levi 
said. 
“With 
its military action in Syria, it is 
becoming increasingly hard to 
predict what sort of actor it will 
become in the future.”

For the Daily 


According 
to 
the 
ACT 
website, students can take the 
test up to twelve times, though 
the majority of students take 
it no more than twice. The test 
comes with a price tag of $68, or 
$52 without the writing section, 
though there are fee waivers 
available.
There is no set price for the 
individual sections yet, but ACT 
officials expect it to be cheaper 
than the price to retake the test 
in full, the New York Times 
reported.
For 
some, 
like 
Nursing 
sophomore Zoe Gierlinger, who 
received extra time to take the 
ACT, the decision is a step in 
the right direction toward a 
more equitable testing process, 
especially for those who receive 
extra time to complete the test 
due to medical necessity.
“For someone like me who 
received extra time on the ACT, 
it would most likely be easier to 
focus with the sections divided,” 
Gierlinger said. “Otherwise, you 
test for six straight hours and 
ultimately it becomes harder to 
keep focus, although the extra 
time is necessary. Dividing the 
sections would help improve 
concentration 
and 
allow 
students to perform at their 
potential.”
LSA junior Jason Fernando 
co-founded Excel Tutoring, a 
standardized test preparation 
company, in 2017 to bridge the 
gap between those who receive 
extensive test preparation and 
those who do not. Fernando 
echoed 
Gierlinger’s 
point, 
adding he thinks the new policy 
will allow lower-income college 
applicants to achieve higher 
scores 
on 
the 
standardized 
exams. 
“I think this will allow for a 
less of a barrier for students who 
don’t have the means to take the 
[full] test over and over again,” 
Fernando 
said. 
“For 
lower-
income students, a cheaper 
test that is not as high-stakes 
can 
be 
more 
advantageous 
for them, and let them knock 
down barriers that they hadn’t 
before.”
The score has received mixed 
feedback 
from 
colleges. 
A 
Georgetown University official 
noted the school would not 
accept individual superscore 
results.

According to the Common 
Data Set, 74 percent of the Fall 
2017 incoming freshman class 
at U-M submitted an ACT score 
when applying. The University 
reports the 25th percentile to 
75th percentile of the incoming 
class’s performance on the test.
The Fall 2017 class’s range 
was a 30-33 out of a total of 
36 points — placing the class 
in the 93rd to 98th percentile 
nationally.
In 2016, the state of Michigan 
switched from offering one 
free ACT test to a free SAT for 
all students in the state. Before 
the switch, the state had used 
the ACT as its free college 
assessment exam since 2007.
A 
2018 
study 
from 
the 
National Bureau of Economics 
Research 
found 
that 
while 
half of SAT-takers retake the 
exam after their first try, these 
retake rates are significantly 
lower among students from 
low-income backgrounds. The 
study found that race impacts 
retake rates, as well— students 
classified as underrepresented 
minorities are nine percentage 
points less likely to retake 
the SAT than white students. 
The 
College 
Board 
— 
the 
organization that administers 
the 
SAT 
and 
Advanced 
Placement tests — cited the 
study as evidence that students 
who retake their exams often 
receive higher scores than those 
who choose to take it only once. 
Joshua Goodman, one of 
the authors of the study and 
a professor of economics at 
Brandeis 
University, 
said 
while the data from his study 
is specific to the SAT, it can be 
generalized to the ACT because 
of the similarities between the 
two tests.
“These are two entities that 
are competing over students,” 
Goodman said. “And they are 
competing by offering the test 
as many times a year as they 
can, trying to make it as easy 
to take as possible. And I think 
this move was partly because 
the ACT was sort of trying to 
figure out how they can make 
their test more appealing by 
making students think they can 
get higher scores the easiest 
way.”
Goodman 
said 
higher-
income students often have 
more information about how 
retaking the tests will improve 
their scores, making the ACT’s 
change possibly detrimental to 

lower-income students during 
the college application process.
“It seems like higher-income 
students 
already 
understand 
that 
part 
of 
the 
college 
admissions game, which is why 
they are retaking these exams 
so frequently,” Goodman said. 
“But then low-income students 
may not quite realize that. 
So if that’s the case, if there’s 
a disparity in the quality of 
information 
students 
have 
about the value of retakes, then 
making retakes easier to do 
may actually exacerbate gaps in 
college enrollment.”
Hartt, who has already taken 
the ACT, said he feels this change 
is coming too abruptly. He said 
there are already students in 
his graduating class who have 
taken the test more than once 
who may have preferred to only 
retake a section. Hartt also 
said he felt this change has the 
potential to allow students to 
cherry-pick their sections into 
what he called an “artificially 
higher” composite score.
“I’m 
almost 
certain 
that 
for the universities that I’ll be 
applying to will make it so that 
you can’t superscore the ACT, 
so everything will pretty much 
be the same as it was,” Hartt 
said. “But I would say from a 
standpoint of having already 
taken it, it just makes me a little 
bit upset that I worked really 
hard and went through all the 
processes to get the score that I 
got, and that students now will 
be able to get artificially higher 
scores because they’re retaking 
one section at a time.”
Additionally, Hartt said this 
change in layout is catering 
to shortening attention spans 
students 
are 
experiencing, 
which he believes is not a good 
idea. Hartt said even though 
the change has made him less 
anxious about preparing for the 
exam, he still views the policy 
in a negative light.
“I 
am 
against 
the 
new 
development because I don’t 
think that it follows what the 
ACT originally was set to do,” 
Hartt said. “I think it was 
originally created to measure 
intellect, and I think that having 
the sections in a certain order 
and having to take the sections 
one after the next makes the 
test more difficult and really 
tests an individual’s intellect 
and their ability to continue 
focusing on things for a long 
period of time.”

so. The website also mentioned 
the 
Order 
educates 
new 
members about the history of 
the group. Current members 
are committed to promoting 
diversity 
both 
on 
campus 
and within the organization, 
according to the website.
In an email to The Daily, 
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen said the Order is 
currently a sponsored student 
organization and is in good 
standing 
with 
the 
Center 
for 
Campus 
Involvement. 
Broekhuizen noted the Order 
is sponsored by the School of 
Information and is entitled to 
benefits — including falling 
under 
the 
University’s 
tax 
exempt 
status, 
using 
the 
“University of Michigan” in 
its name and being eligible for 
funding from the University — 
that accompany its SSO status.
Additionally, 
Broekhuizen 
said SSOs are required to abide 
by a code of conduct set by the 
University.
“The 
Center 
for 
Campus 
Involvement regularly works 
with 
all 
sponsored 
student 
organizations to ensure the 
leaders of these groups fully 
understand 
and 
respect 
both 
students’ 
and 
student 
organizations’ right to freely 
associate,” Broekhuizen wrote.
Multicultural 
groups 
release statements opposing 
the Order
Two 
multicultural 
organizations 
on 
campus 
released statements last month 
condemning 
participation 
in 
the Order and requiring leaders 
in their organizations to forfeit 
their positions upon accepting 
membership in the Order. A 
third organization released a 
statement aligning with this 
position directly to The Daily.
The 
executive 
board 
of 
the United Asian American 
Organizations, 
an 
umbrella 
organization 
for 
Asian 
and 
Pacific 
Islander 
American 
groups, published a statement 
last 
month 
calling 
for 
dismantling 
rather 
than 
modifying the Order, due to 
its “indigenous appropriation, 
elitism and secrecy.” In addition 
to announcing the new policy 
requiring those who accept 
membership in the Order to 
forfeit any leadership position 
held within UAAO, the board 
apologized for board members 
who held membership in the 
Order in previous years.
“UAAO does not stand for 
the 
exclusionary 
practices 
of this organization, James 
Angell, and the manifestations 
of what the Order of Angell has 
done within this campus,” the 
statementreads. 
“This 
group 
has used indigenous and Native 
culture under the name of honor 
and has not advocated for the 
indigenous struggles within our 
student community.”
According to the statement, 
UAAO’s constitution has been 
updated to reflect its stance. 
The statement noted UAAO’s 
advocacy does not exist to 
“decorate 
historically 
racist 
groups” and their resources 
would be better used toward 
assisting 
the 
indigenous 
community 
and 
other 
marginalized groups directly.
UAAO co-chair Dim Mang, 
LSA senior, clarified in a message 
to The Daily that the statement 
applies only to UAAO and not to 
its 20 member organizations, as 
UAAO does not hold jurisdiction 
over them.
Following 
the 
publishing 
of the UAAO’s statement, La 
Casa, 
anorganization 
with 
the goal of supporting the 
Latinx community on campus, 
published a statement aligning 
itself with UAAO’s position. The 
group wrote that it is against the 
Order both in its historical and 
current iterations.
“For over 50 years, students 
and 
student 
organizations 
extended 
every 
opportunity 
for the organization to change 
and 
modify 
practices 
that 
appropriate culture and damage 
the campus climate for students 
of color and other communities,” 
the statement reads. “At each 
point, Order of Angell (formerly 
known as Michigamua) have 
failed to honor those agreements 
and demonstrate the needed 
transparency to ensure that 
their 
current 
practices 
are 
not equally problematic and 
damaging.”
Mang and LSA sophomore 

Julianna 
Collado, 
La 
Casa 
external director, issued the 
following joint comment to The 
Daily when contacted about 
providing further comment.
“Both La Casa and UAAO 
decline to comment further 
on 
their 
public 
statements 
criticizing the Order of Angell 
for the following reasons,” the 
statement reads. “La Casa has no 
additional comments concerning 
organizations that historically 
and currently appropriate and 
bastardize Native culture. La 
Casa continues to strive to 
holistically support the Latinx 
community and remains aligned 
with our allies. Our principles 
and actions remain grounded in 
the legacy of previous activism 
on our campus.
“The 
United 
Asian 
American 
Organizations 
declines to comment due to 
the Michigan Daily’s history of 
misrepresenting our statements. 
Especially 
with 
a 
delicate 
matter such as this, we believe 
that we must decline in order 
to prevent any possible harm 
towards our community. La 
Casa and UAAO stand together 
on this issue and will continue 
to work in tandem with each 
other and other communities 
against this historically racist 
organization.”
According to a new statement 
from the executive board of the 
Arab Student Association sent to 
The Daily, the ASA will also be 
following the UAAO’s position 
and taking a “formal stance” on 
membership in the Order. After 
releasing the statement to The 
Daily, the ASA posted it to its 
Facebook page Monday evening. 
“We refuse the sentiment that, 
through the mere participation 
of our community members, 
the Order of Angell can evolve 
into a platform for diversity,” 
the 
statement 
reads. 
“An 
honest platform for diversity, 
inclusion, 
and 
transparency 
cannot be built on a foundation 
of the oppression of the Native 
community. We will not be 
complicit in the tokenization of 
leaders in our community and 
others, and oppose all secret 
societies who have attempted to 
do so.”
All three statements noted 
the groups’ positions apply both 
to the Order and all other “secret 
societies” at the University. 
The 
statements 
of 
the 
multicultural 
organizations 
follow the lead of the Black 
Student Union, which asked 
a student to step down from 
organization 
leadership 
in 
2011 because of ties to the 
Order. According to the then-
BSU spokeswoman Samantha 
Martin, holding membership 
in the Order violates the BSU 
constitution, 
meaning 
any 
member — not just one holding 
a leadership position — will no 
longer claim membership if they 
accept a spot in the Order.
The Black Student Union did 
not respond to multiple requests 
for comment.
Current Order members 
respond
In an interview with The 
Daily, four members of the 
Order — LSA seniors Roland 
Amarteifio, Vidur Prasad, Kevin 
Ashwood and Public Policy 
senior 
Hannah 
Davenport— 
responded to the statements. 
They did not speak on behalf of 
all current 22 members of the 
Order.
Davenport said the group is 
different in many ways from 
when it was founded, including 
its composition. She said the 
current group is more than half 
female and approximately 50 
percent people of color.
There are few details about 
the current selection process 
available to the public, but 
Davenport said the Order looks 
to bring in students from many 
different 
areas 
of 
campus. 
Davenport described the Order 
as being a place where leaders 
from various corners of campus 
can collaborate, though they 
are aware the approximately 25 
members selected each year do 
not represent all students at the 
University.
“In 
terms 
of 
Michigan, 
it’s actually one of the most 
diverse spaces I’ve ever been 
in,” Davenport said. “I think 
that moving forward, we’re 
only trying to continue that 
and trying to make sure that 
different corners of campus are 
represented and different voices 
are heard. It kind of is like a 
symbolic ‘table’ that people get 
to sit at, and getting as many 
different people to that table I 

think is a pretty big priority.”
The Order has been criticized 
for 
its 
previous 
selection 
process, which barred men of 
color until the 1940s and women 
until 2000.
Members 
rejected 
the 
branding of the Order as a secret 
society — which it was listed as 
in the statements — though they 
understand why they could be 
viewed as such. Amartedifio 
noted the website lists all 
members and the goals of the 
Order, and said if anything, they 
strive to be the opposite: open to 
and interested in hearing from 
other students.
“When I went through the 
process of being tapped, and 
then becoming a part of the 
organization, there was a large 
focus on really acknowledging 
the history and not trying to 
hide it at all,” Amarteifio said. 
“We don’t try to minimize or 
not address the fact that this 
has had this history, but we also 
don’t believe that that history 
is a representation of who the 
organization is now or the 
current members.”
In 
their 
statement 
about 
participation 
in 
the 
Order, 
UAAO said it “condemn(s) all 
the leaders in the 2019 roster 
and past alumni, some of whom 
were on our Board or in our 
member organizations.” 
Ashwood 
said 
the 
Order 
understands the frustration of 
the multicultural organizations, 
but explains the difficulty for 
those condemned. He speculates 
that these students feel a loss 
of community on campus after 
being barred from groups they 
were a part of throughout 
college. 
“If we’re set out to be 
multicultural 
organizations 
and to be the voice of those 
people on campus … we should 
be that voice for them and be 
that support system for them,” 
Ashwood said. “And so, that’s 
what we would hope would come 
out of this, is understanding that 
being a part of (Order of Angell) 
makes them no less Latinx or 
no less Asian American and 
needing of a support system for 
that.”
Representing minorities on 
campus is sometimes a blind 
side of the University, according 
to Ashwood. He says that being 
able to be a voice for these 
students through the Order is 
an honor for him and a way to 
make positive change for these 
communities. 
Creating this campus synergy 
may not be seen through specific 
initiatives, 
Davenport 
said. 
She did not highlight specific 
initiatives the Order has been 
pursuing, 
explaining 
that 
humility was one of the group’s 
pillars.
“As 
far 
as 
specific 
programming, 
one 
of 
our 
tenants is really supposed to be 
humility,” Davenport said. “So 
with the initiatives we do, we 
try not to stamp Order of Angell 
on it, because the goal there is 
more to quietly serve, not in 
a way that is really bringing 
attention to the organization.”
Davenport said a main goal of 
the Order is to promote campus 
synergy, which is described 
on the website as an avenue 
“to 
facilitate 
organizational 
interaction 
between 
student 
groups and their leaders that 
may not have existed before; and 
to enable them to make positive 
change in the best interest of 
Michigan, without recognition, 
either collectively or through 
their respective organizations.”
Members of the Order noted 
they have reached out to La 
Casa and the UAAO “very 
recently” and are hoping to start 
a dialogue.
The 
question 
the 
multicultural groups posed — 
why the Order is a modified 
version 
of 
Michigamua 
rather 
than 
a 
completely 
new 
organization 
with 
no 
connection to the past — is the 
same question current order 
members are asking themselves, 
Davenport said.
“The present is connected 
to the past and the present is 
connected to the future, and 
we’re in the position where 
we get to define the future,” 
Davenport 
said. 
“That’s 
a 
question that we’re asking and 
that we really are wrestling 
with, because that does lie on 
us.”

According 
to 
Akshata 
Kharkar, 
Atharva’s 
sister, 
every morning Atharva would 
wake up at 5 a.m. to finish all 
his work by 8 a.m, and simply 
continue on with his day. As 
an accomplished filmmaker, 
photographer and drawer, it 
seemed there was nothing he 
couldn’t do. 
“If he had a goal in mind, 
he would accomplish it — 
no matter what,” Akshata 
Kharkar 
said. 
And 
this 
tenacity did not go unnoticed. 
“So 
many 
people 
from 
U-M are telling me that they 
knew him — he was really 
compassionate, he would as 
much as he could, try to get 
to know someone,” Kharkar 
said. “He had the best memory 
… he would always remember 
their name and know exactly 
where he met them, what they 
did; he was just really good at 
talking. He would start up a 
conversation 
with 
anyone, 
like we went to Florida one 
year and homeboy just talked 
to this person sitting next 
to him for the whole flight. 
He had no idea who they 
were, they just started up a 
conversation and went for it 
for a couple hours.”
For Zhang, it was that 
effortless, personable quality 
that drew him to Atharva in 
the first place. At a networking 
event for the Alpha Kappa Psi 
business 
fraternity, 
Zhang 
and 
Atharva 
immediately 
clicked. They bonded over 
apertures, or as Zhang says 
“technical nerd stuff.” But, 
because he was stationed in 
El Paso this summer, Zhang 
didn’t hear about Kharkar’s 
diagnosis 
until 
after 
his 
passing. This feels like the 
right way for him to help, he 
said, as he couldn’t be there 
for him before. 
“I can’t pretend I was too 
close with him,” Zhang said. 

“But I felt like I was touched 
enough 
in 
those 
limited 
interactions and I felt like I 
should do this in his honor.”
However, due to a torn 
hamstring Zhang is not able 
to run in Alex’s Great State 
Race. Instead, he will be 
marching from East Lansing 
to Ann Arbor with 35 pounds 
on his back, a task commonly 
known as rucking. Though 
he’s walking, Zhang assures 
this journey is not easy.
“Giving up comes across my 
mind a little bit, but then you 
remember the bigger picture 
and why you’re there for and 
that’s 
motivation 
enough 
to just keep going,” Zhang 
said. “The pain that you feel 
reminds you that you’re alive 
— in this case, it’s a privilege 
to feel pain.”
Business 
sophomore 
Sriram 
Papolu, 
who 
considered Atharva one of his 
closest friends and mentors, 
wanted to emphasize that 
“Atharva means more than 
the running.”
“He had all this — but its 
unfinished,” Papolu said. “So, 
in our time here, as long as 
we get a chance, we owe it to 
people like him to finish. Like 
we have to do this because we 
only have limited time, we 
have to grow and get better 
because somebody else didn’t 
get the chance to.”
This sentiment was echoed 
by Akshata Kharkar, who 
hopes 
the 
ambition 
and 
compassion 
that 
Atharva 
possessed 
is 
not 
only 
remembered, 
but 
used 
as 
a guide on how to live a 
successful and full life.
“I hope that people think 
about their actions and what 
they do now,” Kharkar said. 
“Because my brother lived 
such a great life, in a way that 
he did things that made him 
better and made decisions 
that made his life better. He 
put himself on a path that a lot 
of people can be on and I hope 
that people understand that 

and believe it themselves.”
After his diagnosis, Powell 
received 
treatment 
from 
MSU’s Resource Center for 
Persons 
with 
Disabilities, 
with collaborative support 
from 
U-M’s 
Services 
for 
Students 
with 
Disabilities 
and 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
effectively 
helping 
him 
remain 
in 
East 
Lansing 
and 
begin 
his 
freshman 
year. Similarly to Powell, 
throughout 
his 
treatment, 
Atharva 
was 
frequently 
visited by SSD workers in 
the hospital. All proceeds 
from the event will go toward 
these organizations in order 
to support higher education 
for students with disabilities. 
The proceeds will also allow 
students dealing with chronic 
and 
terminal 
illnesses 
to 
remain enrolled in school and 
get both the financial and 
mental support they need. 
Jill Rice, coordinator of 
services for deaf and hard of 
hearing students at SSD, said 
though the service has been 
operating for almost 40 years, 
many students don’t even 
know it exists. 
“I think this is partly 
stigma,” Rice said. “People 
don’t want to say ‘oh, I have 
a disability.” They think, “I’m 
at the University of Michigan, 
I don’t want to be less than 
my peers.” But we are there 
to help, even for temporary 
disabilities … we want to 
support our students.”
In addition to his walk, 
Zhang 
has 
started 
a 
GoFundMe 
for 
Atharva, 
with all proceeds going to 
the University of Michigan 
Rogel Cancer Center. In total, 
Zhang hopes this race — or 
walk — can bring awareness 
to these sometimes invisible 
illnesses. 
“It’s a really great way to 
bring together and support 
and honor the fallen ones and 
do what we can do to prevent 
this from happening in the 
future,” Zhang said.

American police are not equipped for mental illness
T

he July 18, 2016 shooting 
of 
Charles 
Kinsey 
is 
just one of many police 
shootings of unarmed Black men 
that has garnered media attention. 
Kinsey, a caretaker for individuals 
with disabilities, was allegedly 
accidentally hit by the officer’s 
bullets. The intended target was 
Arnaldo Rios Soto, a man with 
severe autism who had wandered 
away from the group home where 
Kinsey was employed. As Soto sat 
motionless on the ground while 
clutching a toy firetruck, which 
the officer allegedly mistook 
for a firearm, Kinsey tried to 
explain the situation and pleaded 
with the officers not to shoot. In 
this instance, Kinsey survived 
his 
injuries, 
and 
the 
North 
Miami officer who shot him was 
ultimately acquitted of attempted 
manslaughter charges. Beyond 
the connection to racial biases 
in the police force, this example 
highlights 
another 
problem 
plaguing law enforcement: the 
treatment of individuals with 
mental illnesses. 
There is no shortage of stories 
involving those with mental 
illnesses or other disabilities 
experiencing violence at the 
hands of police officers, and they 
often have more tragic outcomes 
than Kinsey’s experience. Take, 
for example, the 2017 fatal 
police shooting of a deaf man 
in Oklahoma, the fatal shooting 
of an 18-year-old man with 
schizophrenia and the brutal 
beating and tasing of a diabetic 
man experiencing altered mental 
status due to hypoglycemia. In 
fact, mental illness was involved 
in 25 percent of police shootings 
in 2017. Even more sobering, 
mentally ill individuals are 16 
times more likely to die from a 
police encounter than the general 
population. Based on these facts 
and the multitude of tragic deaths 
at the hands of police violence, 
it is clear that American police 
officers require further training 
on how to handle cases involving 
those with mental illnesses. 
The main problem contributing 
to the elevated levels of police 
violence 
toward 
individuals 
experiencing 
mental 
health 
crises is that law enforcement 
is often the first line of defense 
called to manage them. The 
mentally ill or those experiencing 
medical emergencies impacting 
their mental state are often 
perceived as threatening to those 
around them. The purpose of law 
enforcement is not to be a frontline 
in providing medical care, such 
as for mental health. However, 
when family members or loved 
ones of someone experiencing 
an acute mental health crisis 
call 911 in search of support, 

police officers often show up, 
rather than emergency medical 
technicians. In some states, such 
as Oklahoma, police officers are 
legally required to transport 
the mentally ill to the hospital 
for 
involuntary 
commitment. 
Oklahoma police officers even 
receive payment from the state 
mental health budget specifically 
for performing these transports. 
Even in states where the police 
are 
not 
legally 
required 
to 
transport involuntary commits 
to the hospital, it is often easier to 
have law enforcement do so. 
The involvement of police 
in mental health emergencies 
concerning 
involuntary 
commitment is often a matter of 
law or practicality. However, it 
often perpetuates the notion that 
the mentally ill are a dangerous 
population. In the vast majority 
of scenarios, people with mental 
illnesses are not a danger to others. 
They are simply in need of serious 
medical attention that can often be 
difficult to obtain. Yet, training for 
police officers seldom focuses on 
the correct management of mental 
health emergencies. Instead, the 
majority of training is centered on 
how to manage individuals who 
actually are dangerous, creating 
a disconnect for police officers 
between what they have learned 
and what they actually experience.

Seth Stoughton, a University 
of South Carolina law professor 
and former police officer, says 
that “do whatever you need to 
do to get home at the end of your 
shift” is the most important 
rule taught to training officers. 
Such a line of thinking clearly 
emphasizes 
the 
worst 
case 
scenario in all situations. Thus, 
police officers are trained to 
seem intimidating to those they 
are 
interacting 
with. 
These 
behaviors can include speaking 
with a loud, booming voice, 
moving closer to whom they 
are 
speaking 
with, 
keeping 
their hand on their weapon and 
maintaining a wide stance. To 
an individual of sound mind, 
such behaviors are unnerving 
and signal the necessity of 
compliance. However, to an 

individual 
experiencing 
an 
acute mental health emergency, 
interacting with police officers 
behaving in this manner is 
downright terrifying. As opposed 
to obeying officers’ commands, 
a mentally ill individual may 
begin to behave unpredictably. 
For example, they may lunge at 
the officer or otherwise try to 
escape the situation. When this 
happens, the officer may then 
resort to violence, such as tasing 
or shooting. Therefore, police 
training does not adequately 
prepare the officers to handle 
the 
complexities 
of 
mental 
health emergencies. 
Treatment of mental illness 
is 
often 
overwhelmingly 
complicated. There is no one 
universal approach on how to 
best handle an individual in 
mental crisis. That being said, it 
is clear that the current method 
of employing law enforcement 
to 
handle 
mental 
health 
emergencies is failing. In order to 
provide better treatment for the 
mental ill in medical crisis, some 
police departments have begun 
to implement Crisis Intervention 
Team 
programs. 
These 
programs are community-based 
and create connections between 
law enforcement, mental health 
care providers, hospital-based 
emergency services and mentally 
ill individuals. CIT programs 
look to educate officers on how 
to best handle mental illness 
without the use of lethal force 
or the arrest of the individual. 
The trainings aim to increase 
empathy and techniques on how 
to best de-escalate a situation. 
Police officers receiving training 
also listen to recordings to 
simulate auditory hallucinations 
sometimes 
experienced 
by 
schizophrenic 
patients 
and 
take multiple daily “pills” made 
of candy to demonstrate the 
difficulties in maintaining a 
treatment regimen. 
Mental illness is extremely 
common in the United States. 
With nearly half of all adults 
diagnosed 
with 
a 
mental 
illness at some point in their 
lives, it is increasingly likely 
that police officers will come 
into contact with a mentally 
ill individual throughout their 
daily work. Currently, police 
encounters with the mentally 
ill all too often employ the 
use of lethal force. In order to 
best provide for the nation’s 
mentally ill population, police 
departments and communities 
must come together to create 
an 
environment 
to 
provide 
assistance to those in crisis.

Andrew Yang offers the best of the 2020 Democrats

ALICE LIN | COLUMN
The Democratic debates are getting us nowhere
A

s I was watching the 
fourth 
Democratic 
debate, the realization 
struck me halfway through that 
I was bored. Since the summer, 
I’ve been following the televised 
discourses religiously to gain 
a better understanding of each 
candidate’s platform and gauge 
their responses to issues affecting 
our nation before the primary 
election. But the fourth time 
around, I just didn’t have it in me 
to sit through another three-hour 
show. With a fifth one scheduled 
to take place in November, the 
question nagged at me: Why do we 
need so many debates? 
Of course, the purpose is 
to allow the public to learn 
more about why one of these 
18 candidates is best fit to be 
president. But is there really 
anything new being said on stage? 
Ever since candidate Andrew 
Yang said it in the second debate, 
it has become more apparent these 
debates are really just “political 
theater.” Candidates still vie for 
standout moments where they 
can get a jab at another candidate 
or a slogan they can overuse — 
like the “I wrote the damn bill” 
line from Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt. It stops feeling like a forum 
for the discussion of important 
issues and more like a moderated 
verbal sparring match. There’s no 
need for an excessive amount of 
debates when candidates are only 
going in circles with their talking 
points and nothing new is being 
introduced. 
The problem with these debates 
is the field of candidates hasn’t 
narrowed; while the third debate 
had only 10 candidates, the fourth 
had 12. The whole purpose of 
having a smaller pool of candidates 
is to get a deeper insight how their 
views and plans differ, but if the 
debates continue to include more 
candidates who probably will not 
win, it defeats the purpose. There 
is less time for each candidate 
to talk and many of the lesser 
known candidates barely get any 
speaking time compared to the 
frontrunners. Even at the last 
debate, the moderators spent a 
lot of time going back and forth 

between candidates who were 
arguing over one issue, which 
restricted the amount of air time 
other candidates got to speak. If 
anything, the qualifications to 
participate in these debates need 
to become more selective so the 
public can focus their attention 
on those who will most likely have 
the best chance at winning the 
primary. 
Furthermore, it felt like the 
candidates were just reusing their 
talking points at this last debate; 
a lot of the topics candidates are 
asked are recycled versions of 
questions from older debates that 
tie back into the larger umbrellas of 
foreign policy, gun control, health 
care and the economy. There is a 
lack of focus on other issues which 
also matter; Sen. Kamala Harris, 
D-Calif., called out the lack of 
focus on women’s rights while 
former Rep. Julian Castro added 
climate change and immigration 
to the list of neglected topics. 
It becomes repetitive to hear 
candidates recite the same lines 
about Medicare for All versus 
private plans when there are so 
many other health care issues the 
audience wants to hear about.

Another 
aspect 
about 
the 
structure of these debates that 
should change is how much 
the audience gets to contribute 
towards 
deciding 
what 
the 
candidates 
discuss, 
especially 
since candidates are running for 
the right to represent these people. 
While the debates are too large to 
follow the structure of town hall 
meetings where constituents get 
to directly ask questions, there are 

other ways to gauge the audience’s 
interests. 
The 
organizations 
hosting the events should allow 
constituents to send in issues they 
want to hear more about or even 
host a livestream where viewers 
around the nation could send in 
questions. While it is also true that 
candidates are able to change the 
subject to focus on women’s rights 
or climate change, it takes away 
from their time to give their input 
on other policy issues. It’s unlikely 
that any candidate would have 
changed their mind in the month 
between debates, so why not ask 
more relevant questions instead 
of forcing viewers to sit through 
another three hours of the same 
discourse? 
All 
of 
this 
comes 
into 
consideration since the University 
of Michigan is scheduled to host 
its own presidential debate next 
fall. Of course, the circumstances 
of this debate will be different 
— the pool of candidates will 
be much smaller and this time 
they will be on opposing sides. 
Even so, the structure of political 
debates 
can 
be 
improved, 
especially since students would 
want a chance to ask questions 
about issues they care about such 
as in previous debates. We should 
aim to make the experience more 
streamlined 
and 
productive 
especially since students have 
a 
personal 
investment. 
For 
many of them, it may be the first 
presidential election in which 
they get to vote. Furthermore, 
a lot of the proposed policies 
will actually impact the future 
of these students, so students 
should be given the opportunity 
to directly participate and gain a 
better understanding of pressing 
issues. 
The 
University 
itself 
stated its intentions to contribute 
as a whole to the development 
and understanding of issues that 
face the nation. With all eyes on 
it next fall, the school should take 
the chance it has to improve on 
the way that these debates are 
structured and set an example for 
the future.

e’ve all experienced 
this story before. A 
businessman comes 
out from the political dark. He 
has never held office before, 
neither local nor national. He 
has one main policy proposal 
that encourages a few people to 
give him a following. At first, he’s 
ridiculed by his peers, the media 
and the public, and few people 
decide to take him seriously, 
particularly online and on social 
media. The argument goes that 
this man is neither experienced 
nor qualified for the nomination. 
For the first few months, he 
lags behind his traditional and 
established competitors but starts 
to weed out established senators 
and governors. And when the 
primaries come around, he begins 
to galvanize the people. Suddenly, 
in one fell swoop, he secures the 
nomination and then shortly after 
the presidency. This is the story of 
Donald Trump. For some, it was 
a horror show highlighting the 
flaws within our political system. 
For others, it was a legendary tale 
of a man that, for lack of a better 
word, trumped the established 
political landscape. Regardless 
of how one may have seen the 
rise of Trump, it is undoubtedly a 
historic political feat.
Fast forward to the beginning 
of November 2017, a relative 
unknown joins the race as a 
Democrat, vying to challenge 
Trump for the presidency in 
2020. His main claim to fame 
— if one could even call his 
existence before the election 
cycle anything akin to “fame” — 
is that he was a tech executive. 
He has one main policy proposal 
that encourages a few people to 
follow him. At first, it seemed as 
though no one mainstream gives 
him attention and chalks his 
main policy as merely a gimmick. 
But, he continues nonetheless. 
While the mainstream TV media 
neglects him, a newer medium 
— the internet — carves him a 
following in the form of podcasts 
and videos. Moreover, he does 
something nearly unprecedented 
in modern America’s divisive 
political climate and crosses the 
partisan divide to speak with 

some of the opposition’s most 
provocative 
and 
influential 
figures. He has developed a 
passionate base on the internet, 
and that support has manifested 
into thousands showing up for 
his rallies. This man is Andrew 
Yang, and his flagship proposal 
is a Universal Basic Income, or 
“Freedom Dividend,” providing 
every adult in America $1,000 per 
month.
Considering the results of the 
2016 election, it would have been 
well-advised for the Democratic 
establishment 
and 
the 
mainstream media to be wary of a 
seemingly small political outsider 
with a fervent media following. 
But they weren’t. And now, a 
man with zero political chops 
hovers around the fifth favorite 
for the Democratic nomination, 
according to Business Insider’s 
polling, competing right behind 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and 
former Vice President Joe Biden.
Yang’s rationale for UBI stands 
on the fact that the immediate 
automation of labor fields will 
disenfranchise millions over the 
next decade. He proposes that 
UBI be the preemptive measure 
for America to brace for the 
Fourth 
Industrial 
Revolution. 
And even now, the ramifications 
of automation have begun to 
show. At the beginning of 2019, 
it was estimated that roughly 25 
percent of America’s jobs were 
threatened by automation and 
potentially 73 million jobs could 
be leveled by automation by 2030. 
Being a tech executive in Silicon 
Valley, Yang has spoken to the 
fact that automation is one of 
America’s greatest coming crises. 
Yet, 
at 
the 
September 
Democratic debate, Yang offered 
to give 10 families $1,000 per 
month for one year to prove the 
effectiveness of UBI, and he 
was met by laughter from the 
other candidates on stage — 
once again, shamelessly proving 
the disconnected nature of the 
Democratic 
Party. 
Millionaire 
Democratic 
candidates 
once 
again patronized average working 
families. These elitist millionaires 
laughed, but everyone else did 

quite the contrary. After the 
debate, the entire pilot paid for 
itself in the form of $1 million 
raised in just 72 hours after the 
debate from 450,000 donors. And 
in the October debate, just one 
month later after being laughed at, 
UBI and automation stood at the 
forefront of the debate. It doesn’t 
seem like anyone is laughing now. 
Furthermore, 
Yang 
has 
fervently placed emphasis on 
bridging the political divide. 
Instead of focusing on why Trump 
should not have been elected like 
other candidates, Yang humbly 
recognizes that there was a large 
and influential disenfranchised 
working class that felt abandoned 
by the Democrats and settled 
for Trump. Yang has become 
an advocate for the Midwest, 
catering to both Democrats and 
Republicans alike, arguing for 
more investment in the Midwest. 
His mottos are also inherently 
bipartisan: “Not left, not right, 
forward” and “Humanity First.” 
Yang’s 
followers, 
comically 
known 
as 
the 
Yang 
Gang, 
are comprised of a coalition 
of 
Democrats, 
Republicans, 
independents and everything else 
in between.
Possibly one of Yang’s most 
impressive 
feats 
is 
not 
his 
meteoric rise in popularity or 
his bipartisan commitment to 
bettering humanity, but his ability 
to dodge the explosive, immature 
wrath of Trump. Ever since the 
announcement of his campaign, 
Trump has barely tweeted about 
him. Think about it. Trump. 
The man who has an opinion on 
everyone and everything has yet 
to speak about Yang. Before, one 
could say it was because of his 
relative obscurity. Now, he has 
reached the main stage, and still 
nothing. There’s something else 
going on here. Andrew Yang is the 
political paradox: He resonates 
with the people like Trump did – 
minus the reckless temperament 
of Trump – and is extremely 
substantive, presenting dozens 
of comprehensive and innovative 
policies.

Fall came on my birthday this year. Not officially, 
and not according to the seemingly arbitrary “first 
day of fall” that our calendars mark every year. On 
that official day, the high was 82 degrees. Given my 
unconventional love for cold weather, this sequence of 
events seriously depressed me. There was not a golden 
leaf in sight, and I was sweating on my way home from 
class. 
I had to wait several more weeks for the real fall 
— the tangible fall — to grace us with her presence. 
By the time she showed up for good it was the first 
week of October. The air turned crisp and a prickly 
breeze danced across my cheeks. The tree outside my 
apartment shimmered with hints of gold, and I wore 
boots to class. It was the best birthday present I could 
have asked for. 
I grew up in a California beach town where we have 
no seasons. We divide the years into rainy halves and 
dry halves and live in a year-round temperature range 
of 50 to 80 degrees. It’s beautiful weather, sure, but 
when deciding on the college that would take me away 
from home I knew it had to be somewhere with more 

temperature variation. I wanted to watch the leaves 
turn for the first time and feel my skin contract in 
bitter cold. I wanted to see the flowers come out from 
hiding and watch the sun melt the last bits of snow off 
the sidewalk. 
Out of all the seasons, though, fall is so easy to 
love. It is not too harsh nor too long, and it brings an 
unbeatable color scheme. It offers me sweaters and 
boots and scarves and pumpkin bread that my mom 
sends me in the mail. The crunching leaves create 
soundtracks for my walks to class and the crispness of 
the air in my lungs makes me smile. I am not swollen or 
sweating; I am cozy and comfortable and happy. 
The closer we come to brushing shoulders with 
winter, the more I recognize fall’s communal spirit. 
She brings us together as we prepare for the looming 
frost. Friends often disagree with me. They say that 
cold weather separates us. That, apparently, our thick 
coats and hunched postures encourage isolationist 
tendencies. 
But I think that a gust of cold air and a fallen leaf 
will teach us more about the meaning of community 
than anything else. I point to the Big House on the 
first Saturday that the air is just a tad too cold to be 
comfortable. I gesture toward the thousands of us who 
still march toward kickoff, gloves in hand. I make a 
note of the crop tops that 
have 
become 
sweaters 
and the sunglasses that 
have turned into beanies. 
I point to the loyalty 
of Michigan’s fans, the 
friends huddling together 
under the lights of a rainy 
night game and the beat 
of students jumping along 
to “Mr. Brightside” just to 
get their blood pumping. 
I point and smile at our 
unbreakable spirit, as I’m 
reminded what it really 
means to be a Michigan 
Wolverine. And then I 
shiver, because it is cold, 
and I can’t seem to get 
enough of it.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

LITERATURE COLUMN

In the past month or so, I have 
started keeping track of what books I 
want to read next by placing them in 
a short, orderly stack next to my bed. 
This is a step forward from my previous 
method, which was to make a spur-of-
the-moment decision after finishing a 
book. I would look at my shelf, suddenly 
enamored by the possibilities it holds for 
a giddy moment before finally lighting 
on one almost by chance. This seemed, 
ultimately, like an odd way to pick 
something that I was to spend several 
hours with later. I thought it would be 
worth considering the structure of my 
reading. 
This 
hasn’t 
been 
going 
well 
at 
all, of course. I 
spontaneously 
move 
things 
around, 
add 
books I deem 
necessary 
for 
whatever 
I’m 
working on, put 
books back on 
the shelf for the 
simple 
reason 
that 
I 
don’t 
really feel like 
reading 
them 
just now. The 
stack of books 
has 
become 
a 
representation 
of my confusion 
and flightiness 
rather than the 
solution to it. 
I don’t study 
literature 
in 
school, but have 
recently started 
taking 
reading 
more seriously. 
My 
reading 
has 
taken 
on 
a 
furtive, 
almost desperate quality, balanced as 
it is between vocation and distraction. 
It’s frequently what I retreat to when 
everything else is too much, and I 
forget that reading is, in fact, work, and 
difficult work at that. In a related way, 
I tend to forget that reading is slow, 
and any given 200-page book might be 
a commitment of ten or so hours, and 
longer if I choose to annotate it. The 
other day I looked at my bookshelf, 
which is full of unread books, and calmly 
realized that it will take me years at my 
present rate to finish everything on it. 
This is a source of mild stress to me as 
much as it provides me with a wellspring 
of possibility. I pass by my bookshelf and 
sometimes open a book at random, flip 
through it, put it back. I feel ambivalent 
about this impulse — it feels cursory, 
usually leaves me feeling hollow. I 
sometimes wonder what the point of 
my collection is, why I’m overwhelmed 
by it, but keep continuously adding to 
it. I can spend hours browsing around 
bookstores, even as the unread books in 
my room pile up. 

I’m reminded, of course, of Walter 
Benjamin’s 
famous 
1931 
essay 
“Unpacking 
My 
Library,” 
a 
semi-
personal 
investigation 
into 
“the 
relationship of a book collector to 
his possessions.” Benjamin wrote the 
essay on the occasion of moving, after 
an acrimonious divorce, into a half-
furnished apartment with crates full of 
nearly 2,000 books. He seems sheepish 
about his habit even as he enumerates 
its appeal — toward the end of the essay 
he admits that “this passion is behind 
the times,” and more than once adopts 
a sort of ironic position that suggests 
the ridiculousness of the collector. 
“Writers are really people who write 

books not because they are poor, but 
because they are dissatisfied with the 
books they could buy but do not like,” he 
writes, deftly compressing all of literary 
endeavor into that of the collector. The 
real thesis of the essay is that collecting, 
at its core, is about appreciating and 
preserving 
the 
kind 
of 
historical 
memory that coalesces in old objects, 
something that has a quality of childlike 
“renewal” of objects. 
The essay is beautiful, generous, 
self-aware and judiciously funny. I 
never really liked it; I don’t find myself 
agreeing with Benjamin most of the 
time. At one point he mentions that the 
“non-reading of books” is characteristic 
of collectors. An unread book is, for me, 
an assignment. Too much of them and 
I can feel them 
staring 
at 
me 
reproachfully. 
I have friends 
who, 
like 
Benjamin, own 
thousands 
of 
volumes. 

It 
seems 

terrifying. 
It’s 
worth 
noting 
that the great 
philosopher 
wrote 
his 

essay 
as 

someone whose 
collection 
is 
specific to topics 
that he had a 
special interest 
in: 
children’s 
books, theology, 
Baroque 
German 
literature. 
It 
means 
something else 
to be in your 
early 
twenties 
and have such 
a 
voluminous 
collection. 
There’s 
an 
element here of 
self-creation, divorced from the actual 
work of reading, that feels slightly 
distasteful to me. 
And yet, this attitude is still more 
legible to me than that of my friends 
who only acquire copies of books by 
happenstance, or only own what they 
read in class, or my housemate, who 
returned from the bookstore one day 
and said, like it was the simplest thing 
in the world, “I finished my book, so 
I went and bought a new book.” A lot 
of the time, these friends are better-
read overall than I am, but just have an 
uncomplicated relationship with the 
physical objects associated with them. 
I am still compelled to buy books, to 
wonder what my collection says about 
me as a reader, a writer, a person. 
Maybe I envy them. Sometimes 
I look at my (still comparatively 
modest) bookshelf and wonder if it 
has a mnemonic quality, as if I will 
not only forget to read these specific 
books but will forget to read at all if 
I don’t have the force of my unread 
books compelling me. On the other 

hand, there is so much pressing on my 
attention that I don’t get to choose: A 
book offers immersion and solace that 
is elusive elsewhere. To have a large 
collection of books is to have a large 
and varied window of possibility that I 
can take comfort in when my world is 
feeling small. This is a silly, irrational 
feeling that is only tenuously related 
with actually reading, but it’s one I 
treasure for its silliness — it reminds 
me that in every ostensibly serious 
thing I do, there is always an element of 
indeterminacy and blind passion. I live 
my life, as Benjamin wrote, somewhere 
in between the “poles of order and 
disorder.”

A library between the
poles of order, disorder

EMILY YANG
Daily Literature Columnist

Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, was deemed great 
for a reason. “Catherine the Great,” the mini-series, hasn’t 
quite decided what that reason is just yet. 
HBO’s new historical drama “Catherine the Great” stars 
Helen Mirren as the titular Russian queen who assumed the 
role following a coup that dethroned her husband, Peter III. 
The premiere follows Catherine and her advisors, including 
the cautious and calculating Minister Panin (Rory Kinnear, 
“The Imitation Game”), as they determine how to handle her 
tenuous grasp on power.
After giving a speech calling for the end of serfdom, 
Catherine struggles to maintain control over her court of 
wealthy landowners and military leaders. In the midst of her 
shaky political future, she is met with a young man’s claim: 
He is the rightful heir to the 
throne. Fearing a possible 
revolt, Catherine ultimately 
decides to disregard her 
liberal principles and call 
for him and his conspirators 
to be executed. This violent 
and 
out-of-character 
decision 
marks 
the 
beginning of her struggle 
to uphold her values while 
cultivating respect as a 
leader. 
As Catherine navigates her life with absolute power, 
she juggles the personal relationships that have defined 
her legacy in history as much as her policies have. Former 
lover and accomplice in dethroning Peter III, Grigory Orlov 
(Richard Roxburgh, “Moulin Rouge!”) demands more of 
a share in her rule due to his involvement with the coup. 
However, handsome military lieutenant Grigory Potemkin 
(Jason Clarke, “Zero Dark Thirty), begins courting the 
queen, much to the chagrin of Orlov. The men, in hopes of 
obtaining bureaucratic influence and wealth, compete for 
Catherine’s affections.
While the costuming and set design beautifully reflect 
the royal grandeur of the Golden Age of Russia, the rest of 
the show does not seem nearly as powerful. Throughout the 
premiere, the threat to the throne and a looming war with 

Turkey feel inconsequential and take back seats to romantic 
subplots. This, of course, is perfectly fine, but without any 
significant dramatic stakes, “Catherine the Great” fails to 
excite in the ways it could.
Helen Mirren, though committed to her role, does not get 
to play with some of Catherine’s more outlandish personality 
traits. Frequent mentions are made to the queen’s infamous 
promiscuity, but she is never shown doing anything more 
than making suggestive eye contact. Rather than dive into 
Catherine the Great’s salacious reputation outright, the mini-
series substitutes any lewd content with tangential scenes of 
lesser court members exchanging sex for power.
This is just the most visible failure of the show to engage 
its audience with the most compelling parts of this woman’s 
history. Catherine’s dynamic with her murdered husband 
and her ambitious son, Prince Paul (Joseph Quinn, “Game 
of Thrones”) is hinted at but ultimately unexplored. In 
splitting its focus between the 
members of her court instead 
of solely Catherine herself, 
the show dilutes whatever 
cultural impact it could have. 
On 
a 
network 
known 
for its provocative content, 
“Catherine the Great” has 
the opportunity to present 
a 
history-making 
and 
enlightened 
female 
ruler 
within the context of her 
own sexuality. Given the chance, the show could break 
expectations of women in politics and present a more 
thorough examination of how power and femininity interact 
in a conservative environment. 
While undoubtedly beautiful, this mini-series does not 
seem to understand its angle in depicting Catherine’s history. 
Not quite political and not quite shocking, “Catherine the 
Great” has trouble choosing what its audience wants. Mirren 
delivers a few lines that strain to be potential feminist adages, 
but the appearance of depth proves as fabricated as the cast’s 
lustrous outfits.
All things considered, “Catherine the Great” is a fine 
show. Though nothing about it is distractingly poor, the 
series suffers from its hesitance to make waves and commit 
to its own controversy. Here’s hoping they at least pay 
homage to that horse rumor.

In 2019, a year when most people try their hardest 
not to offend, not to make light of racism and cruelty, 
Taika Waititi’s Hitler comedy “Jojo Rabbit” should 
not work. To make a drama about Nazi Germany is 
one thing, but to make a film about that same era of 
history that is intentionally comedic — that wants its 
audience to laugh — is another thing entirely. The 
very thought of it is uncomfortable. There is arguably 
nothing more horrific than the actions of Adolf Hitler, 
and there is arguably nothing less funny. 
Yet “Jojo Rabbit” works, and it definitely made me 
laugh. But it wasn’t a mindless, simple kind of laughter. 
It was laughter with substance, with darkness, 
laughter that drew attention to itself, laughter that 
forced me into a painful awareness of why, precisely, 
I was laughing at a movie about Nazism. “Jojo 
Rabbit” straddles the 
dangerously thin line 
that divides comedy 
and 
tragedy 
with 
remarkable grace, and 
the tension that builds 
through this balance 
makes watching the 
film utterly strange 
and eye-opening. 
“Jojo Rabbit” is the nickname of Jojo (Roman 
Griffin Davis, debut), a ten-year old boy growing up 
in Nazi Germany, who is thrown out of a Hitler Youth 
training camp for refusing to kill a rabbit. When he 
returns home to his mother (Scarlett Johansson, 
“Under the Skin”), who he learns is not only critical 
of Hitler but is in fact hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin 
McKenzie, “Leave No Trace”) inside their house, 
Jojo is forced to reconsider his own beliefs and his 
own sense of belonging. His imaginary friend Hitler, 
tellingly played by Waititi, a Maori and Jewish man, 
doesn’t make things any easier. 
But what is “Jojo Rabbit” really about, and why 
is it so uncomfortable to watch? Simply put, “Jojo 
Rabbit” is about us. It is about how children learn 
to hate, and how these children, conditioned to 
hate, grow up to run our governments. It is about 
the allure of discrimination, its power to unite and 
foster communities and make us feel like we belong 
somewhere. Jojo doesn’t actually hate Jews — he 
thinks he hate Jews because his role models do, 

because it is the sentiment his entire community is 
built around. Elsa, the aforementioned Jewish girl, 
even tells him, “You’re not a Nazi, Jojo. You’re a ten-
year old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform 
and wants to be part of a club.” 
Isn’t this exactly what is happening right now? 
Alt-right extremist groups built on racist hate market 
themselves to young, vulnerable, lonely people 
who feel forgotten by the world. Though there is no 
legitimate excuse for participating in these groups 
and playing a role in acting out their agendas, “Jojo 
Rabbit” reminds us that these people are, like us, 
human humans whose evil is not innate, but taught. 
And only by understanding where they are coming 
from can we move forward.
Even if this is the case, isn’t analogizing our 
current social situation to Nazism a tad extreme? 
Maybe even insensitive? In asking this question, I’m 
reminded of what happened earlier this year when 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote a tweet calling the 
detention 
centers 
at 
the 
US-Mexico 
border “concentration 
camps,” 
in 
doing 
so drawing a direct 
parallel 
between 
the current political 
administration 
and 
Nazi Germany. Her 
analogy 
received 
immense backlash but equally immense support, 
with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee history 
professor Rachel Ida Buff affirming AOC’s statement 
as “absolutely” accurate in Newsweek. In explicitly 
linking its subject matter to the social climate of 
2019, does “Jojo Rabbit” exaggerate our situation to 
the point of becoming offensive, or is the film simply 
calling it what it is? 
Maybe the complexity of the questions it 
compels us to ask is what makes “Jojo Rabbit” such 
a bizarre, unsettling viewing experience. Maybe 
my laughter was a kind of defense mechanism, 
an awkward response to my own discomfort and 
newfound cognizance of the unacknowledged evil 
we live among every day. Yet, despite the darkness 
it addresses and the awful, uncomfortable things it 
forced me to ponder, “Jojo Rabbit” is ultimately an 
optimistic movie, affirming that no one, not even 
a ten-year-old Nazi youth, is irredeemable. I can’t 
think of a message for the people of 2019 more 
comforting or more uplifting than that.

‘Jojo Rabbit’ is for 2019

Odditties Sodomies just sounds like it would be 
the name for a compilation of Ariel Pink’s best 
previously-recorded yet unreleased tracks. The 
off-kilter and kitschy Pink has never been known 
for doing things conventionally, and he certainly 
isn’t going to start now. The songs on this record 
were recorded in the days of Ariel Pink’s Haunted 
Graffiti and afterward. The tracks didn’t have 
a place on his main releases, so they were all 
thrown into the Odditties Sodomies series instead.
Unfortunately, it seems these songs may have 
been left off Pink’s previous releases for a reason. 
They are far from his best tracks, but that doesn’t 
mean they’re bad songs by any means. Some of 
them are quite enjoyable. 
However, 
some 
things 
just don’t need to be 
released — some things 
are best left abandoned 
on the cutting-room floor.
None of the songs on 
Oddities Sodomies (Vol. 
2) are essential to Pink’s 
discography, 
but 
now 
that they’ve been brought 
to life, they adequately 
augment 
his 
already-
massive resumé. A few songs, like “Unwritten 
Law,” a snoozer reminiscent of new wave’s most 
mundane, and “Chart-Beep,” an alright song with 
one of the most most blown-out and annoying-
sounding synth lines of all time, probably 
shouldn’t have been unearthed. But for the most 
part, Oddities Sodomies (Vol. 2), if not superfluous, 
is a fun, discretionary listen.

However, some songs stand heads and 
shoulders above the rest. If “Unwritten Law” and 
“Chart-Beep” are the floor of the ocean, songs like 
“The Night Has Opened My Eyes” and “Go Go x2” 
are the Mount Everest and K2s. “This Night Has 
Opened My Eyes” finds Pink crooning Morrissey-
like atop jaunty guitar strums and warm, heart-
filling bass. After all, it is a cover of The Smiths 
song of the same name. However, Pink gives it 
his own signature lo-fi, antiquated twist, and it 
sounds great. He took the song and made it his 
own; it’s an example of a good cover (take notes, 
Weezer).
“Go Go x2,” though it does not reach the same 
highs as “This Night Has Opened My Eyes,” 
deserves to be mentioned in the same breath. It 
is a strange, passionate song directed to a woman 
that, for some reason, Pink cannot bring himself 
to leave. He sheepishly 
sings all sorts of lines like 
“I’m crazy for you / What 
can I do? / I don’t care, 
walk all over me / Till I’m 
black and blue.” Despite 
it’s 
less-than-pleasant 
subject matter, “Go Go 
x2” is a sunny, vibrant-
sounding track that is a 
very welcome addition to 
Pink’s discography.
Odditties 
Sodomies 
(Vol. 2) is just that, a collection of oddities. As 
listeners, we didn’t need any of these songs, but 
that doesn’t mean that they can’t be enjoyable. 
The compilation warrants very few repeat listens, 
but for hardcore fans, it is a nice addition to the 
collection. Ariel Pink isn’t at his best, but he’s not 
at his worst. And that’s about all you can ask for 
with a compilation album of unreleased rarities.

Mexican Summer

On the day of October 1st (sometimes even 
before that), our campus suddenly turns orange. 
Lattes are pumpkin flavored, candy is a meal and 
“spooky szn” is the go-to Instagram caption. 
Even concerts take on a special theme. The 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance University 
Philharmonia Orchestra has been putting on 
their annual Halloween Concert for years, 
contributing to the spooky season and pleasing 
long time patrons.
Though the only music that immediately 
comes to mind when you think “Halloween 
music” is “This is Halloween” from “The 
Nightmare Before Christmas” or “I Put a Spell 
on You” from “Hocus Pocus,” the Philharmonia 
Orchestra was able to fill an entire afternoon 
with lesser known, but no less spooky songs for 
all ages to enjoy.
The music was a thrilling mix of recognizable 
classics and exciting new discoveries. “Infernal 
Dance of King Kastchei” from “The Firebird,” 
composed by Igor Stravinsky, made me jump 
out of my seat with its vibrancy and intensity. 
“Pavane for a Dead Princess,” composed by 
Maurice Ravel, brought me back to a dream-
like peace with its beautiful lullaby-like melody. 
Adam Glaser’s “March of the Little Goblins” gave 
the audience the perfect opportunity to see all of 
the costumes of the performers as they marched 
on stage to the beat of their own melody. With 
some of SMTD’s most talented performers, each 

song was executed to perfection with stunning 
accuracy and breathtaking passion.
Though the music was fantastic, the skits 
were even better. Each piece was introduced by 
a new conductor in a new costume, somewhat 
related to the piece. When I say “somewhat” I 
mean SMTD master’s student Leonard Bopp 
entered to conduct Swan Lake in a chicken 
costume, claiming to be “winging it.” Between 
songs, we saw SMTD master’s student Elias 
Miller, dressed as a princess, fall dead, only 
to be revived by a knight in shining armour — 
SMTD master’s student Nathan Bieber — while 
conducting “Pavane for a Dead Princess.” 
The six student conductors even put on a 
choreographed “Ghostbusters” dance to get the 
crowd on their feet.
The audience participation took the cake — or 
should I say candy, which was handed out after 
the concert. Some patrons had been coming for 
over 20 years, some weren’t even 20 years old. 
Little Mary Poppinses and Wonder Womans 
roamed the upper balcony, clapping along to 
Ghostbusters and jumping out of their seats to 
see the “worlds scariest monster.” No matter 
what age, everyone thoroughly enjoyed the 
performance.
The Halloween Concert is a long-standing 
tradition that brings in all kinds of goblins, 
ghouls and ghosts of all ages. If you missed this 
supernatural, fun-filled evening, don’t worry. 
There will be one next year, and the year 
after, and the year after. You can see this 
show until you’re mummified, or maybe 
just dressed as such!

Sainristil turning hype to production

Throughout 
spring 
ball, 
Mike Sainristil’s name had an 
inescapable 
presence 
inside 
Schembechler Hall.
Offensive players praised the 
three-star freshman receiver. 
Defensive players said he was 
terrifying to face. Coaches spoke 
ad nauseam about his adaption 
to the college game.
“He’s been really good,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, 
summarizing 
the 
general 
consensus at the time. “Can’t say 
enough good things about him.”
Fall ball, though, brought a 
different reality.
Suddenly, 
Sainristil 
was 
absent. Ronnie Bell took his 
place at the center of the 
Wolverines’ ever-churning hype 
machine and actually followed 
up 
with 
production, 
while 
Sainristil notched just one catch 
for eight yards through seven 
games.
“Coming in from spring ball, 
the speed adjustment was really 
a big factor,” Sainristil said. “… 
Fall camp is just more game 
reality. Putting yourself in those 
game situations compared to 
spring ball is when (we do) big 
installs.”
That, in turn, lowered a 
confidence 
that 
had 
soared 
throughout the spring.
“A couple times during fall 
camp, a couple times during 
season 
practices 
where 
I 
just really wasn’t locked in,” 
Sainristil said. “Because I was 
just feeling like I wasn’t giving 
my all to the team. I kinda didn’t 
like the position I was in.”
Slowly, though, Sainristil has 
begun working his way onto the 
field, mostly as the slot receiver 
in three and four-wide looks.
Saturday against Notre Dame, 
he doubled his career reception 
total with a key second-quarter 
third-down conversion. Two 
quarters later, he notched his 
first 
collegiate 
touchdown, 
weaving through a trio of 

would-be tacklers for a 26-yard 
score to put Michigan up, 45-7.
“It felt great scoring for the 
first time,” Sainristil said. “… 
And it surprised me that my first 
touchdown was against Notre 
Dame.”
Sainristil knows that he’s not 
a central cog in the Wolverines’ 
offense. Bell, Donovan Peoples-
Jones, Nico Collins and Tarik 
Black take that mantle, with 
82 of Michigan’s 92 receiver 
receptions between them.
It’s part of what makes the 
regular season different from 
spring 
ball, 
when 
Peoples-
Jones, Collins and Black were 
out, 
allowing 
Sainristil 
to 
thrive. But it’s also given him 
an opportunity to develop at 
his own pace, adapting to the 
college game over the course of 
the past three months.
“Really seeing a lot of growth 
from Mikey,” Harbaugh said. 
“The last four weeks, especially 
in practice, he’s really gained 
a lot of confidence in catching 
the football. He’s always been 
really good at route running. He 
went through a little spell there 
where he wasn’t catching the 
ball great. Now his confidence is 
back and surging.”
Sainristil’s route to this point 
took the path of most freshman 
contributors. It required hours 
in front of the jug machine, 
working with graduate assistant 
coach and former Michigan wide 
receiver Roy Roundtree. Every 

time the Wolverines had what 
Sainristil calls an “opportunity 
practice,” Roundtree’s message 
was simple: “Come out, have 
a day.” Sainristil took that 
message to heart, knowing it 
would eventually translate to 
game scenarios.
All of that is normal. The 
difference for Sainristil is where 
expectations stood six months 
ago, when he was praised as 
Michigan’s 
next 
freshman 
sensation.
Since then, he has been able 
to push his position on the 
depth chart out of his mind, 
focusing instead on his own 
performances.
The result is a catching ability 
that’s finally caught up to his 
route-running and yards-after-
catch savvy. The proof is a trio 
of catches and a game-high 73 
yards in Michigan’s biggest win 
of the year.
Thinking 
back 
on 
the 
touchdown catch that defined 
his day, Sainristil knows that it 
didn’t win Michigan the game, 
that it won’t catapult him to the 
top of the depth chart, that it 
isn’t going to make the coming 
weeks any easier.
And yet, as he spoke, he 
couldn’t help a massive smile 
from spilling over his face.
“I wouldn’t say I overcame 
a lot within these months that 
I’ve been here, but it was just a 
big relief,” Sainristil said. “I just 
wanted to get into the end zone.”

How Mel Pearson used his timeouts

Despite a four-goal lead 
midway through the third 
period Friday, the Michigan 
hockey team was reeling, and 
coach Mel Pearson had had 
enough.
The game was at hand, and 
the players settled. In turn, 
they 
took 
on 
unnecessary 
wear-and-tear, 
defending 
against Western Michigan’s 
dominating zone presence.
Instead of attacking the 
opposing net, Michigan players 
were 
blocking 
shots 
and 
taking hits, fending off attacks 
with their bodies. Instead of 
dominating the ice as they 
had done all night long, they 
had become mere spectators, 
watching along as the other 
team had its way with things.
And 
so 
Pearson 
called 
timeout.
“(What) you’re trying to do 
(in) that last seven minutes 
(is), force them to have to 
play in their zone,” Pearson 
said. “So when it does take a 
toll on you for the next night, 
we were playing in our zone 
way too much in our defense 
and having to endure more 
hits and more pressure when 

they 
shouldn’t 
have 
been. 
And (sophomore goaltender) 
Strauss (Mann) too, you wear 
him down a little bit.
“So that was the whole 
reasoning as to try to not give 
them any momentum or a life 
for the next night.”
It was an example of a coach 
seeing a play 
slip and making 
a 
timely 
judgement call 
to sway things 
in 
his 
favor. 
The Wolverines 
had 
gotten 
complacent. 
He wanted to 
remind 
them 
what 
exactly 
they 
had 
to 
lose. Sure, not the game. But 
there was the chance of a 
shutout still up for grabs and 
the condition of players, who 
may have benefitted from a 
couple less bumps or bruises 
on Saturday’s game.
“I 
just 
usually 
see 
a 
momentum shift a little bit in 
and when you do that and just 
trying to slow them down and 
whatnot,” Pearson said. “And 
just give our guys a little break 
but just try to light a fire under 
them. The matches weren’t 

working so couldn’t get the fire 
going underneath our guys.”
“And 
it 
didn’t 
work,” 
Pearson said on the timeout 
Friday. “We should’ve saved 
the time out.”
While he expressed wanting 
to save it at the time, there was 
really no better time to use 
it. The team was losing focus 
and there was really nothing 
to lose to try to jolt effort in 
them. Pearson didn’t need to 
use it for strategy to secure a 
close game. It would have gone 
to waste.
“You can’t save them, you 
can’t take them with you,” 
Pearson said. “So you might 
as well use them, we only get 
one, and I thought was a good 
chance to use it and try to 
change that momentum.”
It was a similar case on 
Saturday, except instead of 
using the timeout defensively 
to change momentum, Pearson 
used 
it 
offensively. 
After 
sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert 
took 
a 
hit 
from 
behind, a minor penalty was 
assessed but the 
players thought 
otherwise. 
Trusting 
his 
players, Pearson 
gambled 
a 
timeout in the 
chance 
the 
call would get 
overturned. 
“That point of 
the game, yeah, I 
have no problem 
with that because it could have 
been a big momentum change,” 
Pearson said. “And as it worked 
out, we didn’t really need our 
timeout maybe when it’s 3-1 at 
some point later, you’re still 
down two goals though. So not 
as critical, going down one.”
In hockey, there’s only one 
timeout for 60 minutes. When 
and how it’s used can shift a 
game in any direction. And for 
Pearson, his weekend uses of 
his were no-brainers.
“It’s just a gut feeling.”

Amy Dilk ready to take the next step

It’s never easy for a freshman 
to fill a vacant starting role. It’s 
even harder when that freshman 
is replacing a program’s all-time 
leading scorer.
That 
was 
the 
case 
for 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk last 
season. Katelynn Flaherty, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
program’s 
most 
decorated 
player, graduated the year prior 
to Dilk’s arrival, leaving a huge 
hole in the Wolverines’ roster. 
Dilk came in as Michigan’s top 
recruit, a five-star ranked No. 40 
in the nation, with the weight of 
filling an important role on the 
team. 
While 
a 
highly-touted 
freshman like herself could let 
the pressure to replace Flaherty 
affect her play, Dilk did what was 
asked of her and got acclimated 
to the college game.
“I think the biggest challenge 
for her last year was that she 
didn’t realize that you have 
to actually play hard on every 
possession,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “I think 
when you’re in high school and 
you’re such an elite player ... you 
can take possessions off where 
you don’t even realize that you’re 
taking possessions off.”
With a full season under her 

belt, Dilk evaluated her weaker 
aspects and improved them. 
One area in particular is taking 
care of the ball. Dilk turned the 
ball over 3.4 times per game last 
season, higher than both she and 
Barnes Arico would like.
Additionally, 
Dilk 
looked 
to improve her shooting (39.4 
percent last season) and scoring 
(7.2 points per game) abilities 
during the offseason. With three 
other players averaging over 10 
points per game and two other 
established scorers averaging 
over seven, she was not asked to 
be one of the Wolverines’ main 
scoring threats last season. But 
after losing three of their top 
four scorers from last season, 
Dilk will be relied upon as a 
distributor and a scorer.
“I think those two things are 
primarily what I’ve focused on 
over the summer because I think 
that’s what I needed to improve 
to be the best that I can be,” Dilk 
said. “Taking the fundamentals 
and going back to the basics of 
making sure my free throws 
snap, my form is perfect, and 
tightening my ball handling 
skills so I don’t create those 
turnovers. 
“We call it daily vitamins. It’s 
just things that we personally 
need to get better at that we do 
every day as an individual.”
Added Barnes Arico: “I think 

for her to take those next steps in 
her development ... she’s gotta be 
a more consistent shooter. She’s 
gotta be willing to take those 
shots and knock down those 
shots, and she has worked hard 
on that in the offseason.”
Dilk’s 
teammates 
have 
praised her passing ability. She 
finished seventh in the Big Ten 
last season with 4.4 assists per 
game. Her knowledge of her 
teammates’ style was key to this.
“As a point guard, coach talks 
about it all the time, being able 
to make the right reads and just 
knowing the person also,” said 
junior forward Hailey Brown. 
“Building relationships on the 
court as well, I think she just did 
a really good job her freshman 
year.”
While Dilk has worked hard 
to improve her game, the most 
important factor that could 
lead to a breakout season is the 
increased confidence that comes 
with having played a year in the 
system. 
“(She) knows her teammates, 
and knows what she has to do to 
get those wins, and she knows 
what she has to do to put her 
teammates in the best position,” 
said sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon. “I think she’s going to 
look even better than last year, if 
you guys can even imagine what 
that looks like.”

‘M’ defense shuts down Terrapins

Studs out and the U-M 
Soccer Stadium packed, the No. 
16 Michigan women’s soccer 
team 
dominated 
Maryland, 
4-1, in its last regular-season 
game Sunday. Sitting behind 
just Wisconsin and Rutgers 
in the Big Ten standings, the 
Wolverines 
(13-4-1 
overall, 
8-2-1 Big Ten) put in a fierce 
performance 
against 
the 
Terrapins (9-7-3 overall, 5-5-1 
Big Ten). 
During a crisp fall afternoon 
where 
Michigan 
outshot 
Maryland, 12-2, it was the 
Wolverines who dominated for 
90 minutes in a critical game 
leading into the postseason. 
Though the game included 
multiple 
goals 
from 
the 
winning side, the Wolverines’ 
defense also proved to be an 
important aspect to its success. 
In its 18 games prior to Sunday, 
Michigan allowed just 15 goals, 
an average of .83 goals per 
game and an impressive stat 
from a commanding back line. 
The center back partnership 
of junior defender Alia Martin 
and 
sophomore 
defender 
Sydney Shepherd anchored the 
Wolverines’ back line and shut 
out the Terrapins until the 83rd 
minute. 
“We 
want 
to 
be 
good 

defensively,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein. “When 
you want to be a great team you 
have to be a team that can keep 
the ball out of your net. It is a 
goal of ours to be good at that.”
The 
goals 
came 
for 
Michigan this year, with junior 
midfielder Sarah Stratigakis 
leading the team in points with 
six goals and nine assists. Yet, 
the importance of the backline 
is obvious. As the Wolverines 
dominated offensively Sunday, 
it was the calmness of Martin 
and Shepard that controlled the 
flow of the game. The passing 
between the two and into the 
opponents’ defensive third gave 
Michigan the edge. 
“This year, defensively, we’ve 
been very strong, especially 
with Hilary Beall back their 
in 
the 
goal,” 
Stratigakis 
said. “We’re doing well both 
offensively and defensively and 
that’s how we are winning our 
games.”
Though the team could not 
finish the game with a shutout, 
the confidence remained. With 
Big Ten Tournament play about 
to begin, the team will rely 
heavily on its back line to grind 
out wins in games in which 
results matter more heavily. The 
Terrapins’ lone two shots came 
on a long shot from freshman 
forward Kaylee Kozlowski that 
barely challenged Beall. The 

second came from a late second 
half goal. In other words, 
Michigan’s back line didn’t give 
Maryland the chance to reach 
its defensive third. 
“It’s 
a 
huge 
confidence 
booster any time you can get 
a result at your last regular 
season game,” Klein said. “Now 
we can close the chapter on 
regular season and prep for 
postseason.” 
Whether it was clearing 
a ball from a Terrapin cross 
or keeping possession in the 
final moments of the game, the 
Wolverines stayed compact and 
dominant throughout the game. 
Out of five players who played 
the full 90 minutes, Beall, 
Shepherd and Martin were 
three of them. Not only does 
this show their importance 
to the squad, but also how 
dependable they will be as the 
postseason begins and a trophy 
is at stake. 
Michigan has not played 
in a Big Ten championship 
game since 2005 and hasn’t 
won since 1999. Anything can 
happen in tournament season 
and the Wolverines will look to 
capitalize on that chance and 
use their stalwart defense to do 
so.
“We are very confident,” 
Stratigakis 
said. 
“We’re 
a 
team to watch out for coming 
postseason.”

Partridge, Campanile form friendship in football

The year Paramus Catholic 
High School finally got over 
the hump, going from four 
straight losing seasons to a state 
championship in 1997, the team 
was full of the kind of players 
that might not go onto the NFL, 
but could still elevate everyone 
around them.
It was the kind of season 
that sparks careers and forges 
connections that come back 
around, so maybe it was no 
surprise that 22 years later, two 
of those guys ended up on the 
same team again.
Chris 
Partridge 
was 
the 
senior captain, the heart and 
soul of the team who doubled as 
a hard-hitting middle linebacker 
and tough-as-nails right guard.
Anthony 
Campanile 
was 
the coach’s son, the talented 
freshman quarterback whose 
season was derailed by injury.
The two friends kept in touch 
throughout the years, crossing 
paths as they rose in the 
coaching profession. But they’d 
never been at the same place 
before, not until this year.
Now, 
Partridge 
and 
Campanile 
are 
reunited 
at 
Michigan — Partridge coaching 
safeties 
and 
special 
teams 
and 
Campanile 
coaching 
linebackers.
In some ways, they’re two 
guys talking football, just as 
they always have. The stakes are 
just a little higher now.
***
Paramus Catholic’s coach at 
the time was Mike Campanile, 
Anthony’s 
father 
and 
the 
patriarch of a quintessential 
New Jersey football family. 
Mike’s four sons are all coaches 
— Nunzio is the interim head 
coach and offensive coordinator 
at Rutgers, and Vito and Nicky 
are 
successful 
high 
school 
coaches back where they grew 
up.
Anthony and his brothers 
spent their childhoods coming 
to practice with their dad. They 
got to know the older kids, who 
made them feel special. As 
Anthony grew up, he naturally 
meshed with Partridge, who 
also came from a football family 
— his father, Rick, was a punter 
in the NFL and helped coach 
high school teams. Partridge 
was an easy person to look up to.
Campanile managed to make 
varsity as a freshman but tore 
his ACL over the summer before 
he had played a single snap. He 
was forced to watch from the 
sidelines as his team made a run.
Partridge was an inspiration 
to Campanile that entire season. 
He was never the most athletic 
or naturally talented guy, but 
he worked hard to mold himself 
into not only a top player, but a 
leader. The way he and the other 
team leaders went about their 
season made Campanile want 
to work that much harder to get 
back so he could play with them. 
In the process, Partridge and 
the other seniors helped guide 
Campanile’s recovery.
“I wish they did play together 
in high school,” Mike told The 
Daily in a phone interview. 
“(Anthony) used to watch those 
guys, the older guys, and he 
became close with those guys 
from not being able to play. He 
would watch them all day, watch 

every little thing they did. … It 
was a good year, it really was. 
Too bad he couldn’t have really 
participated with them on the 
field. That would’ve been — ah! 
— it would’ve been so good. But 
what are you gonna do?”
After 
Paramus 
Catholic 
scored the game-winning two-
point conversion in the state 
title game, Partridge headed 
off to college while Campanile, 
finally recovered from injury, 
stepped into a larger role. But 
their friendship, as it turned 
out, was just beginning.
In college, the two hung out 
over breaks and during the 
summer, heading to the Jersey 
Shore and talking football. And 
when both entered the coaching 
world, their trajectories were 
remarkably similar.
As 
Anthony 
started 
his 
freshman 
year 
at 
Rutgers, 
Partridge was about to graduate 
from Lafayette College and 
knew 
his 
feature 
laid 
in 
coaching. So he gave Mike a call.
Mike 
no 
longer 
coached 
at 
Paramus 
Catholic 
but 
encouraged Partridge to apply 
there anyway. Mike suspected 
what Partridge later proved: 
that he had what it took to be a 
champion, on the field and on 
the sidelines.
Partridge 
served 
as 
the 
defensive 
coordinator 
and 
assistant head coach of Paramus 
Catholic from 2003-04 before 
brief college stints at Lafayette 
and The Citadel. After three 
years 
away 
from 
football, 
Partridge came back as the head 
coach of his alma 
mater in 2010. In 
2012, his literal 
and 
figurative 
return to his roots 
was complete, as 
he lifted Paramus 
Catholic to its first 
state title since 
that fateful one 
back in 1997.
Campanile 
coached 
linebackers for one year at 
Fair Lawn High School before 
becoming 
the 
defensive 
coordinator and later offensive 
coordinator, at Don Bosco Prep, 
one of Paramus Catholic’s most 
bitter rivals. For two years, the 
friends coached against each 
other.
“Didn’t say a word to each 
other, before or after (the 
game),” 
Partridge 
told 
The 
Daily. “Later, about a month or 
so. We’re both competitors, so 
we know it’s all in good love.”
Through all this, the two met 
up at times, talking Xs and Os 
with whatever means they could 
— even if it meant scrounging 
for a napkin and scrawling out 
hypothetical plays.
Partridge was the first to 
make the jump to the Power 
Five when he took a job as a 
recruiting analyst with the 
Wolverines in 2015. When the 
Scarlet Knights visited Ann 
Arbor that year, Campanile, 
then at Rutgers as a wide 
receivers and tight ends coach, 
brushed paths with Partridge 
once again.
During 
his 
tenure 
at 
Michigan, Partridge has helped 
bring 
in 
several 
big-time 
New Jersey players — among 
them Rashan Gary, Michael 
Dwumfour and Cesar Ruiz. But 
last year, he recruited more than 

just players. A position opened 
on the Wolverines’ defensive 
staff, and Partridge knew just 
the guy.
Partridge 
had 
talked 
to 
Campanile about his job at 
Michigan before, and how much 
he loved the place. But this time, 
he hoped his friend could see for 
himself. He called Campanile 
and told him, “This could be 
something special, and I think 
it would be awesome for you to 
look into.”
Then, Partridge told Jim 
Harbaugh 
about 
Campanile. 
With 
Campanile’s 
other 
connections on staff — he knew 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown from his time at Boston 
College 
and 
then-offensive 
analyst Ben McDaniels from 
a mutual stint at Rutgers — 
he seemed like a perfect fit. 
Campanile came out to see for 
himself, an official visit of sorts, 
and felt right at home. He was 
hired in January of this year.
In football, chemistry on 
the staff is just as important 
as chemistry on the team. 
Otherwise, it becomes every 
man for himself, people just 
striving for paychecks instead 
of working together towards a 
common goal. The way Mike 
describes it, good camaraderie 
lights a fire under a coaching 
staff, and that rubs off on the 
players. In a broader sense, 
communication is vital in such 
a 
high-stress 
position, 
and 
familiarity can breed that kind 
of assertiveness.
“It was awesome because we 
work 
really 
hard 
and 
you’ve 
gotta 
have guys you 
trust and lean 
on and stuff 
like that in this 
profession,” 
Partridge said. 
“I think now 
we have that. 
It’s so huge.
“And 
(Campanile) just adds to it 
because I’ve known him for 
so long. It’s cool just to see the 
mesh of coaches that we have 
here now and the fact that we 
get along so well for so long, I 
knew he would fit if that makes 
sense. I just knew he would be a 
guy that Jim would love and the 
whole staff would love.”
At 
Michigan, 
Partridge 
and 
Campanile 
are 
expert 
recruiters — bouncing New 
Jersey recruiting knowledge off 
each other — and work closely 
together on the defensive staff. 
Partridge came to his interview 
straight from his office, where 
he and Campanile were drawing 
up schemes. They bring not 
only that all-important sense of 
camaraderie, but also the same 
qualities that lifted their once-
moribund school: toughness, 
leadership and a will to win.
Back in the old days, when 
Partridge and Campanile were 
both new to the wide world of 
coaching, Partridge remembers 
the two joking about how they 
were so like-minded — wouldn’t 
it be fun to work together?
Campanile 
maintains 
that 
they 
never 
exactly 
framed 
it that way. But he still sits 
back sometimes and thinks to 
himself, “What are the chances 
of this?” He knows that if 
you went back and told the 

freshman quarterback with a 
torn ACL that he’d be here, with 
Partridge, coaching at the same 
school, he wouldn’t believe you.
“How often does two kids 
from the same team end up 
coaching at a major college 
together?” Mike said. “That’s 
especially if one of them’s not 
the head coach. … It’s kind of 
strange that they ended up on 
the same team.”
***
That 1997 season did more for 
Partridge and Campanile than 
simply making sure they left 
with a trophy.
Ask Campanile, and he’ll say 
Partridge was a masterful team 
leader the entire season. Ask 
Partridge, and he’ll tell you how 
much Campanile’s passion for 
the game shined through. Ask 
either one, and they’ll tell you 
they could tell the other was 
going to be a coach, even back 
then. And guiding their team 
was a perfect role model in the 
business.
Mike was a master motivator, 
pushing players to places they 
didn’t believe they could take 
themselves. He believed that 
hard work and leadership were 
vital, both on the sidelines and 
in the locker room. Those are 
values both still take to heart.
“(Mike) really gave me the 
foundation 
of 
how 
football 
should be played,” Partridge 
said. “Hard-nosed, tough, just 
the qualities of an old-school 
coach that I try to employ now.”
Mike, who still coaches high 
school freshmen even into his 
70s, follows his former players 
from afar. He offers up advice 
— “You can’t play the game 
for them,” he says to Anthony 
when he’s too hard on himself 
— and sees in the two the same 
competitive fire they had back 
in high school.
Now, 
Partridge 
and 
Campanile, two kids who grew 
up and won a state championship 
together, are striving for Big 
Ten championships together. 
They sometimes hit the road 
together on recruiting trips 
and meet up with their families 
other childhood friends — many 
of whom are also coaching 
— when they’re back in New 
Jersey. Instead of scavenging 
for napkins to get in some Xs 
and Os, they get to talk football 
together, all day, every day, on 
the whiteboards in their offices.
“I think the similarities really 
lie in what we learned growing 
up,” Campanile told The Daily. 
“About, there’s nothing wrong 
with 
being 
tough. 
There’s 
nothing wrong with having 
character. … There’s really only 
one way to do it. Be tough, do 
your job, do it to the best of your 
ability. But love your players. 
Be a rational, competitive and 
compassionate person.
“ … That’s something I think 
we probably learned when we 
were young, from our staff in 
high school, which inspired 
us to be coaches, among other 
guys that we played with in high 
school to be coaches. That’s the 
cool thing.”
Maybe the odds of them both 
ending up here were small on 
paper, but after the two friends 
built their foundations in the 
same place and brushed paths 
for years, it’s only appropriate 
that things have come full circle.

Michigan finishes 13th

The circumstances weren’t 
advantageous for the Michigan 
women’s golf team this past 
weekend 
at 
the 
Landfall 
Tradition 
tournament 
in 
Wilmington, N.C. But that’s 
what’s 
expected 
when 
competing in a tournament 
fielding 13 of 18 teams ranked 
in the top 50 on a challenging 
course in inclement weather. 
And 
yet, 
the 
Wolverines 
finished in a formidable 13th 
place. The team finished at 
27-over par (296, 303, 292) over 
the course of three days and 54 
holes. Junior Ashley Kim was 
the top individual performer, 
finishing 2-over par and tied for 
17th place. 
Michigan felt like it had 
something to prove. Coming 
into this high-level tournament, 
the last of the fall season, the 
Wolverines 
hoped 
to 
finish 
on a high note and gain some 
momentum for the offseason 
before the year picks up in 
February.
“We had quite a few flashes 
of some high-level golf,” said 
Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“In our final round, we really 
played quite well. I think we had 
a little bit of something to prove. 
We were the fourth-lowest team 
score (on the last day). This was 
definitely a moral victory.”
Going into the final day of 
the tournament, Michigan was 
in 15th place and focused on 
moving up in the standings. They 
accomplished this by limiting 
their mistakes and capitalizing 
and staying in control on par 
5s. In the final round, they were 
3-under par on such holes.
There 
were 
plenty 
of 
positives to take away from 
this tournament, like Kim’s 
continued consistency and good 
play. This was Kim’s second 
top-20 individual finish in four 
events. In the first round, she 
shot 2-under par, notching her 

third under-par round of the 
season. Her play this tournament 
reaffirmed everything she has 
been working on throughout the 
summer and fall. 
“It was nice for her to see (her 
hard work) come together on a 
hard golf course in some pretty 
tough 
conditions,” 
Dowling 
said. “That’s only going to build 
some confidence for her. She is 
working on the right things and 
that validates the work she has 
done.”
Sophomore 
Ashley 
Lau 
followed Kim by finishing the 
tournament 6-over par (72, 76, 
74) and tied for 39th place. This 
was her second top-50 finish of 
the season. 
As a collective, Michigan 
was excited to compete against 
some of the best talent from 
around the country. While it did 
not finish as well as they did in 
similar caliber tournaments at 
the beginning of the season, this 
tournament showed what they 
are capable of. 
“If you look at our schedule 
we are constantly trying to play 
against the best teams on some 
great golf courses,” Dowling 
said. “That really prepares us 
for the big picture which is 
the postseason and the NCAA 
championships. It’s a really big 
challenge but it’s also something 
that our team welcomes every 
time we tee it up. It’s always 
a great opportunity and we 
embrace it as much as we can.”
The 
Wolverines 
do 
not 
compete in another tournament 
until February but will use this 
time off to prepare for the spring 
season.
“The idea for the spring just 
keep building on those flashes of 
brillance we had,” Dowling said. 
“It shows our capability. We have 
a great lineup of tournaments in 
the spring and have some nice 
changes to work on our games, 
compete, and spend some good 
time over the winter to make 
some 
improvements 
in 
our 
consistency.”

‘M’ gains experience

The Eastern Michigan Fall 
Classic is a small event at the end 
of cross country season. You could 
even say it’s unimportant, but 
that’s not the case to Michigan 
coaches Mike McGuire and Kevin 
Sullivan who view it as a great 
oppurtunity to showcase young 
runners’ talent and the work 
they’ve put in all season.
The 
Michigan 
men’s 
and 
women’s cross country teams 
competed at the Eastern Michigan 
Fall Classic on Friday in Dexter, 
Mich. While a small event, the 
meet is still a good benchmark for 
the young Wolverines searching 
for experience at the end of the 
fall season.
Michigan rested its starting 
lineups in preparation for the Big 
Ten championships meet next 
Sunday. And even though the 
meet was not scored, that didn’t 
stop the Wolverines from having 
what Sullivan labeled a positive 
day, gaining experience for their 
young runners. 
For the men, sophomore Gabe 
Mudel was the first to cross for 
the Wolverines in fourth place, 
with a time of 15:04. Freshmen 
Colton Yesney and James Gedris 
crossed the line next in seventh 
and ninth, respectively.
“Our guys did a good job of 
injecting themselves in the race 
and being competitive,” Sullivan 
said.
The women’s team brought 
a larger group to the meet and 
got similar results. Five runners 
finished from spots eight to 13, led 
by senior Faith Reynolds in eighth 

place.
“Faith’s been running with the 
travel squad all year so I thought it 
was a strong race, ” said Michigan 
coach Mike McGuire.
This is the second time the 
Wolverines 
have 
raced 
this 
course this season, the first of 
which was in the season opener 
at the Michigan Open, where they 
had overall slower performances.
“We came back and improved 
on what they established in late 
August on this course,” McGuire 
said.
This all comes after an entire 
fall of training and an entire 
season of experience. And while 
most of these runners don’t get 
to see action as often as some 
of their teammates, when the 
opportunity arose on Friday, they 
showed up.
“Really 
happy 
that 
their 
body of work in the falls being 
reflected,” McGuire said.
While 
the 
runners 
here 
aren’t running in the postseason 
this year, they may next year, 
making this experience possibly 
invaluable.
“We will have people running 
in the Big Ten meet who were in 
this position a year ago,” McGuire 
said.
Preparing for next year isn’t 
all experience is good for. In the 
more immediate reality, this 
is a time for young runners to 
showcase what they’ve worked 
towards. 
“This is like studying all 
fall and taking an exam at the 
end,” McGuire said. “This exam 
happens to be different and 
maybe next year, this exam will 
be the Big Ten meet.”

We’re both 
competitors, so 
we know it’s all 
in good love.
