over

University

Michigan faculty, students 
and 
community 
members 

gathered 
to 
perform 
and 

watch 
performance-based 

art and comedy acts in a “Not 
My President’s Day” rally 
in opposition to the current 
President Donald Trump.

The rally was organized 

by Bad and Nasty, an online 
movement that has organized 
and planned performance-
based rallies at more than 63 
locations in four countries, 
including 
the 
U.S. 
on 

President’s Day in retaliation 
against the 2016 election. The 
movement 
describes 
itself 

as a coalition of activists, 
artists and concerned citizens 
who wanted to create spaces 
where they could express 
their emotions in light of the 
election.

Bad and Nasty was created 

and 
organized 
by 
Art 
& 

Design Prof. Holly Hughes. 
She 
described 
how 
the 

movement came to exist based 
on the responses she received 
from what she called an “idle 
threat” against Trump she 
posted on a Facebook page 
made in the weeks following 
the election. In the post, she 
invited all the “Bad Hombres 

and 
Nasty 
Women” 
— 

referring to Trump’s dialogue 
toward 
undocumented 

immigrants 
and 
women 

during the election — to take 
action on President’s Day. 
Within a day, Hughes said, 
she couldn’t keep up with the 
number of people expressing 
interest in and wanting to 

participate in the movement.

“By 
the 
next 
morning, 

there were so many people 
that 
wanted 
to 
interpret 

the idea on their own I was 
moaning, because I couldn’t 
add them quickly enough to 
the Facebook group,” Hughes 
said. “Within a day 2,000 
people signed up on our Bad 

and Nasty website.”

She went on to describe 

how far the movement has 
spread and how diverse it is, 
spanning from a cabaret in 
Wyoming to an all immigrant 
poetry-slam in Brooklyn.

LSA 
junior 
Leila

co-chair of Michigan Refugee

University, said the event was 
held to provide information to 
students who had questions 
about the refugee crisis but 
may not have felt comfortable 
asking them in public settings 
— especially after President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
recent 

immigration ban on several 
Muslim-majority countries.

“We had a lot of people come 

up to us specifically after the 
executive order on refugees 
and immigrants asking us, 
because they knew that we 
knew about the topic, what was 
happening in Syria,” she said.

The University of Michigan 

is slated to receive an overall 
2.5 percent increase in funding 
— a 2.4 percent increase for 
UM-Ann Arbor, 3.1 percent for 
UM-Dearborn and 2.8 percent 
for UM-Flint — as a part of Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder’s 
recommended 

budget for the 2018 fiscal year.

Snyder’s 
recommendations 

include an overall state public 
university funding increase of 
$36.6 million, bringing total 
operations funding to nearly $1.5 
billion. If the budget is ultimately 
approved by the legislation, this 
would mark the seventh straight 
year state funding for higher 
education has increased.

At 
the

Board 

of 
Regents 
meeting, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
criticized 
Snyder’s 

recommendation, saying it lags

Author, historian and activist 

Rebecca Solnit drew a full crowd 
to Rackham Auditorium on 
Monday evening in her “Hope 
and Emergency” lecture as she 
discussed the importance of 
maintaining hope in current 
political climate and of using 
stories to affect change.

The lecture was a part of 

the Jill S. Harris Memorial 
Lecture series, honoring the 
memory of Jill Harris who was 
an undergraduate student at 
the University in the 1980s. 
Each year, as part of the 
series, the University brings 
a distinguished visitor who 
will appeal to undergraduates 
interested in the humanities. 

English Prof. Megan Sweeney 

introduced Solnit to the crowd, 
sharing how she felt Solnit’s 
writing — spanning 18 books, 
numerous essays and a column 
in Harper’s Magazine — has 
impacted society.

“Rebecca 
Solnit 
tells 

compelling, 
lyrical, 
essential 

stories,” 
Sweeney 
said. 
“In 

telling these stories, she offers 
fresh insights about politics 
and social change, community, 
geography, 
wandering 
and 

walking, the environment … 
Whether she’s writing about 
an explosion in Halifax, Nova 
Scotia, in 1917, or the birth of 
Zapatismo in Chiapas, Mexico 
in 1944, Solnit has an uncanny 
ability to make the faraway seem 
nearby.”

Indeed, when Solnit came 

on stage, she used powerful 
vignettes to illustrate the effect 
of the current administration 
has had on the nation in the 
last month, which, according 
to Solnit, has been to unite the 
country in protest.

“When the Environmental 

Protection Agency was silenced 
early in the (President Donald) 
Trump era, a rogue EPA Twitter 
account appeared, and then 
one for the National Parks 
Service … (and) 200 coders

Knight-Wallace fellows cover confidentiality, legal issues and collaborative news to over 200

Among 
the 
panelists 
of 

the University of Michigan 
Knight-Wallace 
Fellowship 

panel held Monday at Rackham 
Amphitheatre 
were 
Bastian 

Obermayer and Marina Walker 
Guevara, two journalists who 
helped 
break 
the 
Panama 

Papers — a prominent story 
implicating 
high-ranking 

government 
officials 
from 

dozens of countries for tax 

crimes.

Also included in the panel 

discussion 
were 
French 

journalists Edouard Perrin, a 
former Knight-Wallace Fellow, 
and Laurent Richard, a current 
Knight-Wallace 
fellow, 
who 

helped reveal the Luxembourg 
Leaks, 
which 
involved 
the 

secret tax deals between the 
government 
of 
Luxembourg 

and 
major 
international 

corporations.

The 
event, 
which 
was 

attended by over 150 students, 
professors 
and 
journalists, 

began with remarks about the 
evolving 
challenges 
facing 

journalists 
in 
the 
United 

States today from Will Potter, 
a 
former 
Knight-Wallace 

Fellow and visiting professor 
of journalism at the University.

“We have a president that 

calls CNN and The New York 
Times 
fake 
news, 
and 
as 

Charles 
(Eisendrath) 
noted 

earlier, regards the free press 
as an enemy of the people,” 
Potter said. “I think it bears 
a reminder of the importance 
that it plays in the history of 

the United States; it’s not one 
that is new or unique in world 
affairs but it is something 
that is taken for granted — it’s 
regarded as something that’s 
always there.”

Potter emphasized to the 

audience 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s treatment of the media 
represented the biggest threat 
to the profession of journalism 
in modern American history, 
but 
unlike 
journalism 
in 

other countries, investigative 
journalism 
rarely

Ranking first in research 

spending among public universities 

for seven consecutive years, the 

University of Michigan’s research 

continues to grow and diversify. 

With programs in engineering, 

medical research, data science and 

the humanities, the University 

spent $1.39 billion in research 

development in 2016—a record 

amount. This 7.2 percent increase 

from last year is the second highest 

in the nation, following Johns 

Hopkins University. Most of the 

year’s growth came from a $467 

million increase in expenditures 

from the Department of Health and 

Human Services.

Approximately two thirds of 

spending is facilitated by federal 

agencies. Since 2011, federal funding 

for research has decreased by 11 

percent. Despite these decreases, 

the number of University research 

contracts increased by 3.6 percent, 

with the dollar amount of each 

contract rising by about 14.8 percent. 

Jack Hu, vice president for 

research, is confident the University 

will be able to hold on to these funds 

for years to come.

“I think we are very 

competitive,” Hu said at the Board 

of Regents meeting on Feb. 16, 

according to MLive. “We are very 

good in securing grants from all 

agencies of the government. Federal 

funding is still very dominant, in 

terms of the source in funding for 

our research. Over the last two 

to three years, we average about 

57 percent of the total in terms of 

federal support for research, so it is 

a very important source of research 

funding.” 

Hu said the University needs to 

be cognizant of potential changes 

in federal funding due to the 

new presidential administration. 

However, not all University funding 

comes from the federal government; 

funding from the University 

increased by 7.86 percent between 

fiscal years 2015 and 2016 and $317 

million out of the total $456 million 

increase came either from the 

University’s general fund or from 

medical school resources.

In a recent interview, Hu also 

said diversification of sources is 

necessary to continue to develop 

research.

“The goal is to diversify sources 

of research funding and continue 

to expand our partnerships with 

industry,” Hu said.

ON THE DAILY: U RESEARCH CONTINUES TO EXPAND

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Professor Juan Cole, who specializes in the Middle East and Middle Eastern conflicts, talks 
about the ongoing conflict in Syria at the League on Monday.

TE ACH - IN ON SYRIA

Self-affirmation 
and 
self-

awareness 
are 
the 
keys 
to 

productivity — or so Julia Lee, 
Business 
postdoctoral 
fellow, 

thinks. 

A 
crowd 
of 
about 
200 

gathered Monday afternoon for a 
presentation by Lee, who explored 
the power of self-insight and its 
ability to help workplaces grow. 
She highlighted the importance of 
internalizing other people’s views 
about one’s personal contributions 
and strengths — a process called 
relational self-affirmation — in 
the fourth Positive Links Speakers 
event organized by the Center 
for Positive Organizations this 
semester.

According to Lee, when an 

employee is asked to analyze their 
contributions in the workplace, 

the results tend to be biased and 
misleading. She suggested asking 
others how they perceive these 
contributions 
helps 
increase 

productivity.

“When it comes to assessing our 

own weakness and own strengths, 
unfortunately we are full of blind 
spots,” Lee said. “Maybe if you ask 
other people how they see you and 
what contributions you’re making, 
maybe your vision of who you are 
becomes a little bit less blurry.”

Lee compared relational self-

affirmation to reading an obituary 
about oneself or looking into a 
mirror that other people hold up. 
It is a narrative-based process that 
relies less on one’s own evaluation 
of oneself and more on other 
people’s perceptions.

One of the event organizers, 

Katie 
Trevathan, 
associate 

director 
of 
communications 

for 
the 
Center 
of 
Positive 

Organizations, 
compared 

relational self-affirmation to the 
Myers-Briggs 
Type 
Indicator, 

which is a psychological test used 
to understand how people interact 
with others and make choices.

“It’s an opportunity to get a 

360 (degree) view of yourself,” 
Trevathan said. “You get these 
really cool stories that you might 
not even remember but somehow 
it touched your family, your 
co-worker and you can help build 
up this portrait of you at your best. 
Instead of looking at the things 
you can improve upon, you’re 
emphasizing the stuff that you 
already do really well.”

Lee then went on to explain the 

results of her research as a doctoral 
candidate at the Harvard John F. 
Kennedy School of Government.

Her research asked meaningful 

people in a subject’s life to write 
stories about them. Lee found 
subjects 
felt 
more 
powerful 

after reading these stories about 

their personal strengths and 
contributions. 
She 
argued 

people are more likely to 
problem solve in teamwork 
settings when they receive 
these 
narratives 
prior 
to 

working, compared to those 
that do not.

Lee is currently the first 

postdoctoral 
student 
with 

the 
Center 
for 
Positive 

Organizations. She will be 
starting as a 10-year faculty 
member in the Ross School of 
Business by summer 2017.

LSA senior Jeewon Oh was 

inspired by the lecture and 
hoped to utilize relational 
self-affirmation in the future, 
in order to be beneficial to 
her friends. She also said 
the lecture prompted her to 
become a better listener in her 
social circle.

“I thought about my friends 

and being a positive impact 
to them,” Oh said. “All of 
my friends are kind of going 
through this senior year life 
crisis and I think it would be 
better to go and ask them and 
see how they’re doing.”

of the event’s sketches and acts, 
which ranged from personal 
journal readings and comedy 
acts. Many of the actors were 
involved with the University’s 
Educational Theatre Company 
or were a part of the School of 
Art & Design BFA in Interarts 
Performance program.

ETC Director Callie McKee 

was the Master of Ceremonies 
for the event and performed a 
recitation of a prose piece she 
wrote after the election. In it, 
she describes the emotional 
response she felt when the 
candidate she had campaigned 
for lost. In a compelling, yet 
comical sense, she illustrates 
the “hole” left when Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton lost 
the election.

“I woke up this morning and 

I was faced with a disturbing 
lack of Hillary,” McKee said. 
“She had been there for nights 
before, for years before, in 
magnets, buttons and shirts, 
pictures framed and cut out, 
articles, greeting cards. Her 
profile carved into the skin of 
a gourd, coursed, yet gooey, 
orange, 
yet 
decidedly 
not 

orange, her profile glowed 
against the dark and greeted 
trick-or-treaters.”

ETC 
member 
Theresa 

Beckley-Amaya, an LSA junior, 

performed a piece she titled 
“I Am Protest,” in which she 
describes how she sees her 
role in society.

“My 
life 
is 
a 
protest,” 

Beckley-Amaya said. “A queer, 
mixed, 
spiritual 
woman 

of color in white, Catholic 
suburbia. 
Now, 
don’t 
get 

me wrong, I am immensely 
grateful for my community, 
as it shaped me into who I am 
today, a battling activist who 
constantly questioned, ‘Why 
in the world can’t women be 
priests?’ ‘Why was our teacher 
fired for being gay?’ Breath, 
fight, breath, protest, breath, 
exhale. I am an on-going act of 
protest.”

Art & Design senior Ian 

Renstrom, of the Interarts 
program, 
performed 
a 

comedy stand-up act. Later, 
he discussed how the faculty 
helped prepare his piece.

“Channel 
the 
darkness,” 

Renstrom said. “For me, it 
was a very vulnerable time 
when Trump got elected, I 
was alone in my room and 
watching 
everything 
turn 

red on the map and thought: 
‘What is happening? Everyone 
is failing me.’ I feel hopeless, 
this was like the epitome of 
hopelessness.”

Renstrom 
said 
he 
saw 

the 
arts 
in 
the 
country 

under 
attack 
by 
the 
new 

administration. At the end 
of 
January, 
Trump 
stated 

he wished to cut programs 
such as public broadcasting 
— programs that cost 0.02 
percent of federal funding.

“It’s inspired me to get 

angrier,” he said. “The U.S. is 
the one country that doesn’t 
have 
a 
state-funded 
art 

initiative. Trump is getting rid 
of the National Endowment 
for the Arts, which is like the 
closest thing we have.”

He said the central message 

of his performance was to 
create change and progress 
during Trump’s presidency. 
He hoped the rally would 
spawn similar events in the 
future, since he felt it was a 
way to express his mind. 

“Let’s not fuck up the next 

four years,” Renstrom said. “I 
want people to realize we can 
overcome this for sure. He’s 
going to get away with half 
the things he’s doing. People 
are regretting voting for him. 
There’s going to be hope.”

He also said he felt the 

University has neglected to 
support 
performance-based 

art forms in favor of more 
mainstream projects. 

“They’re supportive of very 

accessible 
stuff,” 
Renstrom 

said. “Like, oh we’ll do ‘Angels 
in America’ or ‘Rent,’ but I 
feel like with performance art 
people don’t take it seriously 
and the University is becoming 
more accepting. I just wish it 
was faster.”

Fourth-year 
medical 

student Harold Gomez saw 
the event on Facebook and 
felt his views aligned with the 
movement’s message.

“I 
think 
of 
the 
most 

important for me that, as you 
can tell I’m an immigrant, too, 
being in the United States and 
being American is tolerance,” 
he said. “There have been 
many 
statements 
for 
the 

Muslim 
community, 
people 

who are supporters of Planned 
Parenthood, LGBTQ, who I 
feel transgress all that we have 
done over the past 50 years for 
civil rights … I think there 
should be more work done by 
the University to try and foster 
that kind of environment and 
prevent things that happened 
with the email controversy 
from happening.”

last 
weekend,” 
Solnit 
said. 

“Intelligence 
agencies 
and 

individual employees seemed to be 
placing themselves in opposition 
to the administration. The power 
of the presidency is to command. If 
people do not obey the commands, 
the power does not exist.”

Solnit went on to speak about 

the Women’s March, the travel 
ban executive order and how she 
came to think of hope as a catalyst.

For 
Solnit, 
hope 
became 

important in 2003, when U.S. 
troops descended on Iraq. Today, 
she sees hope as the driving force 
of all change in the country.

“Fourteen years later, I use the 

term hope because it navigates 
the way forward between false 
certainties of optimism and of 
pessimism, and the complacency 
of passivity that comes with both,” 
Solnit said. “Hope, for me, has 
meant a sense that the future is 
not yet written, and that we don’t 
actually know what will happen, 
but we may be able to write it 
ourselves.”

Solnit, 
a 
self-identified 

progressive 
whose 
political 

ideologies often color her writing, 
did not shy away from claiming 
partisan affiliation in her speech.

“I’m just assuming you’re all 

progressive here,” Solnit said. 
“For those of you who aren’t, I’m 
assuming we can bring you in … 
because it’s more fun and it has 
more people. It has better facts, 
too! The facts are generated on our 
side but the stories have not been. 
We need to tell riveting stories 
about how a progressive agenda 
can make their lives better.”

Solnit returned to her theme of 

hope later in her speech, saying 
that hope in activism — hope that 
what is being done will make a 
difference, even if it isn’t evident 
— is what drives change forward.

“The most important effects 

are often the most indirect,” 
Solnit said. “I sometimes wonder 
when I’m at a mass march like 
the Women’s March a month ago 
… whether the reason it matters 
is because some young woman is 
going to find her purpose in life, 
that will only be evident when she 
changes the world in 20 years as a 
great litigator. Maybe the purpose 
of what you’re doing won’t reveal 
itself in your lifetime, but it will be 
tremendous nonetheless.”

Many audience members came 

to the event because of a passion 
for Solnit’s writing, and a feeling 
of connection to her words. Liz 
Bayans, a resident of Toledo, Ohio 
drove all the way to Ann Arbor 
to hear Solnit’s speech. She feels 
Solnit’s bold stances are what 
make her writing so important.

“I think that she talks about a 

lot of topics people maybe don’t 
breach or feel comfortable with 
discussing openly,” Bayan said. 
“I think it’s important that those 
things are discussed in a more 
mainstream venue.”

Taubman 
graduate 
student 

Phillip Redpath came to hear the 
talk because he’s using elements of 
Solnit’s work in his master’s thesis 
in architecture, but he also shared 
Bayan’s enthusiasm for the way 
Solnit presents her ideas.

“I came because I thought it 

might be relevant to my thesis, 
but also more so because of the 
current political climate,” Redpath 
said. “To me, she offers a way of 
approaching things, not like a 
‘here’s what you do’ but a ‘here’s 
how to think about what to do.’ ”

that they didn’t know about 
it, so we wanted to provide, 
because we had the position to 
do so, (a) comfortable setting 
and educational setting for 
people to learn about it from 
the ground up so that they feel 
more educated on the topic.”

Cole started by explaining 

how the conflict began with 
peaceful protests in Syria in 
March 2011, around the time of 
the Arab Spring, in which both 
Tunisia and Egypt overthrew 
their long-term rulers.

Cole 
stated 
these 

protests 
began 
with 
the 

youth and expanded to a 
broader population as loss 
of employment and lack of 
opportunity 
became 
more 

frequent. He also described 
the unrest in Syria in regard 
to President Bashar Assad’s 
authoritarian regime.

“Any time there’s a ceasefire 

or a slight political opening, 
people come out and protest,” 
he said. “They protest the 
regime, 
they 
even 
protest 

ISIL.” 

Though 
the 
revolution 

did begin peacefully, Cole 

described the violent reaction 
of the regime and the military 
tactics it used to respond to the 
protests, including firing tank 
shells into groups of peaceful 
demonstrators.

“This regime is not nice,” 

he said. “It’s not a nice regime. 
It 
kills 
prisoners. 
There’s 

nothing more helpless in the 
world than a prisoner. They 
torture prisoners to death. 
Not one, not two, how many 
prisoners do we think they 
tortured to death in the last 
five years? At least 10,000.”

Four 
hundred 
thousand 

Syrians were found dead by 
the end of 2016, 11 million are 

currently homeless and 13.5 
million are in need of some 
form of aid or assistance, Cole 
stated in his presentation. 

One 
of 
his 
conclusions 

about civil wars was the 
idea that many people don’t 
understand how easily, or how 
quickly, a nation can fall into 
this sort of unrest.

“People don’t understand 

civil wars if they don’t live 
through them,” he explained. 
“They think it’s something 
that happens to other people, 
but it can happen to you. You 
can fall into a civil war.”

The 
majority 
of 
Syrian 

refugees escaping the chaos 
of their home nation have fled 
to Jordan, Lebanon or Turkey. 
For comparison, he stated the 
United States has let in 22,000 
refugees, while Turkey has 
let in 2.5 million. Turkey had 
many economic benefits from 
the influx of refugees.

“The refugees, when they 

came in, they increased the 
money supply,” Cole said. 
“They figure that Turkey’s 
economy grew 4.5 percent 
because 
of 
the 
refugees 

coming in, otherwise it would 
have stalled out.”

Once refugees enter these 

new countries, however, they 
often find similar hardships 

with standards of living, he 
explained. Many are often 
denied access to local jobs 
and, as a result, are isolated 
and forced to live in tent 
cities.

Michigan has the second 

highest population of Syrian 
refugees in the United States, 
after California, with more 
than 1,400 Syrian refugees in 
September 2016. A majority of 
the Michigan refugee families 
reside in the cities Troy and 
Dearborn.

LSA junior Alaina Dehner 

attended the event because 
she was hoping to learn more 
about an issue with details 
that might be misconstrued 
or not fully explored through 
social media conversations 
or other sources that many 
college students are exposed 
to.

“I think it’s important for 

students to come to events 
like these if only to stay 
informed,” she said. “There’s 
not a whole lot we, as students, 
can do directly involving the 
situation, directly impacting 
the situation, especially with 
the stance that Prof. Cole 
mentioned 
that 
America’s 

taking on it right now, but just 
to stay informed I think is of 
the utmost importance.”

PROFESSOR

said. “However, we keep in mind, 
when 
adjusted 
for 
inflation, 

funding still lags well behind 2011 
levels.”

The 
$316.1 
million 
budget 

recommendation for the Ann 
Arbor campus is lower than the 
funding level in 2011, when the 
state instituted a 15 percent cut to 
higher education funding.

Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
vice 

president 
for 
government 

relations, 
echoed 
Schlissel’s 

sentiment in a statement and said 
the University appreciates the 
increase in funding, but plans to 
advocate for a greater amount of 
funding and more opportunities 
in the future.

“We 
appreciate 
that 
this 

budget 
recommendation 

continues the recent trend of 
increased funding for higher 
education,” 
Wilbanks 
wrote. 

“In the coming months, we will 
work with the state Legislature to 
support this increase and explore 
opportunities to do better, if 
possible.” 

Conversely, state Rep. Kim 

LaSata 
(R–Bainbridge 
Twp,), 

chair of the Michigan House 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee 

on Higher Education, said in a 
statement she is emboldened 
by the increased investment in 
higher education and would like 
to see this funding in Michigan 
continue to increase to pre-
recession levels. LaSata did not 
respond to interview requests 
from the Daily.

“I am encouraged by the 

proposal to invest more money 
into higher education and will 
work hard as chair to ensure 
these dollars are spent in an 
efficient and fair manner,” LaSata 
wrote. “Michigan’s colleges and 
universities have still not fully 
returned to their pre-recession 
funding levels and it is my goal 
to see these institutions made 
whole again using dollars tied to 
performance.”

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–

Ann Arbor) said in a phone 
interview he was pleased to see 
at least a small increase, but said 
he believes higher education 
in Michigan is still severely 
underfunded.

“I’m happy to see at least higher 

education got a small increase,” 
Rabhi said. “But the governor cut 
higher education substantially 
back like five years ago and if you 
adjust for inflation, we’re not even 
close to where we used to be — 
it isn’t good enough, we can do 
better.”

In 
addition 
to 
funding 

increases, 
Snyder’s 
budget 

recommendation also includes 

a provision to limit any tuition 
increases 
to 
3.8 
percent 
or 

$475 per student in order for a 
university to receive any new 
performance funding.

In her statement, LaSata said 

she believes efforts to cap tuition 
will aid in making college more 
affordable and accessible

“This will serve to keep tuition 

increases down and ultimately 
allow more students to pursue 
their educational dream,” LaSata 
said.

Contradicting this idea, Rabhi 

said he believes this will have a 
vicious effect on higher education 
institutions, because he thinks the 
state is limiting its funding, while 
also capping tuition increases as 
ways for universities to receive 
any additional funding.

“We’re putting our higher 

ed institutions in a situation 
where the legislator is capping 
their tuition increases and also 
underfunding them at the same 
time,” Rabhi said. “So they’re 
really hamstringing the ability 
of our public universities to 
provide that high quality of public 
education that we’ve come to 
expect.”

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Republicans, 
wrote in an email interview 
he personally doesn’t support 
massive 
increases 
in 
higher 

education funding without more 
specificity and transparency in 
how 
Michiganders’ 
taxpayer 

dollars are being allocated.

“Federal 
student 
aid 
only 

accounts for roughly 3% of 
Michigan’s 
higher 
education 

spending, the majority of the 
higher education budget actually 
goes to ‘University Operations,’ 
” 
Zalamea 
wrote. 
“Without 

more transparency, I personally 
wouldn’t 
want 
my 
taxpayer 

money going towards university 
sponsored partisan events or 
towards the discounted tuition 
rates of undocumented students.”

In comparison to Zalamea, 

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair 
of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 

of 
the 
College 
Democrats, 

wrote in an email interview he 
unequivocally supports increased 
higher 
education 
funding. 

Kelly said he believes Snyder’s 
recommendation is a positive 
step, but advocates to see more 
invested in higher education.

“While we are glad this is 

another positive step in the right 
direction, we need the state 
government to go much further 
in supporting higher education in 
Michigan,” Kelly wrote. “A 2.4% 
increase is nice, but that likely 
won’t even be a drop in the bucket 
for most students, we would 
strongly urge the legislature and 
Governor to support our students 
by increasing funding even more.”

threat to physical well-being.

“Obviously the risks are 

high in the United States, but 
in other countries, we can be 
talking about their lives that 
are on the line,” Potter said.

Obermayer, 
who 
writes 

for the German newspaper 
Süddeutsche 
Zeitung, 

highlighted the importance 
of being methodical when 
investigating complex data 
leaks. He noted the scope 
of 
an 
investigation 
like 

the Panama Papers, which 
encompassed over 11 million 
pages of leaked documents, 
makes the process of review 
even more important.

He also noted the challenges 

of language barriers, political 
knowledge 
and 
sourcing 

that journalists face when 
investigating 
international 

scandals.

“You 
need 
people 
on 

the ground who know the 
language,” Obermayer said. 
“When I was investigating the 
Panama Papers, a part of our 
research involved Icelandic 
politicians, and ... I personally 
don’t know a word of their 
language. You also need to 
have people who know the 
country and politicians.”

Much 
of 
the 
panel 

discussion centered around 
issues faced by investigative 
journalists in the information 

age, such as security issues 
surrounding encryption and 
data transfer and coordinating 
work between large teams of 
reporters.

One 
of 
Obermayer’s 

colleagues on the Panama 
Papers investigation, Guevara, 
from 
the 
Washington 

D.C.-based 
International 

Consortium of Investigative 
Journalists, spoke about the 
challenges faced during large 
collaborative 
projects 
like 

Obermayer’s 
research 
into 

tax evasion in Panama, which 
involved journalists from over 
100 media outlets.

“How 
do 
you 
convince 

journalists to let go of some of 
the control over their work?” 
Guevara 
asked. 
“Because 

when you collaborate, you 
share 
a 
lot 
of 
research 

and resources, but when it 
comes time to publish, you 
have to respect each other’s 
independence.”

Perrin, 
who 
helped 

spearhead 
the 
large 

investigative 
LuxLeaks 

project, 
echoed 
Guevara’s 

sentiments.

“You need to be really 

disciplined 
and 
need 
to 

respect the plan and date,” 
Perrin said, emphasizing the 
necessity to uphold ethical 
standards of fact verification 
prior to publication.

This, Guevara added, is 

particularly 
important 
in 

light of the increasing rate of 
large-scale scandals. She cited 

the revelations of corruption 
in FIFA, the international 
body governing soccer, and 
Petrobras, the Brazilian state-
run petroleum company.

The 
panel’s 
focus 
then 

shifted 
from 
journalistic 

methods and ethics to the 
means of facilitating large 
transfers of data.

Richard, editor in chief of 

Premières Lignes Télévision, 
a French media outlet, spoke 
about his new project — 
Freedom Voices — that is 
being 
developed 
alongside 

University researchers.

Freedom Voices is a service 

that 
enables 
journalists 

to save information to a 
secure server if their work 
or safety is jeopardized. If 
the journalist using Freedom 
Voices is imprisoned or killed, 

their information is then sent 
to a team of journalists who 
will finish and publish the 
uncompleted work.

“SecureDrop 
makes 

communication of documents 
more secure, safer to be a 
whistleblower or investigative 
journalist,” Richard said of the 
open-source 
whistleblower 

submission 
system. 
“But 

to 
send 
information, 

whistleblowers also can also 
opt to use postal mail, which 
is often very secure.”

Guevara 
concluded 
the 

event by stressing the role of a 
journalist as a public servant 
whose job is to share facts 
that have a public interest.

“I believe there is moral 

responsibility in journalism 
to think about what your story 
will change,” Guevara said.

Following the event, LSA 

junior Tyler Robinson said 
he believed it was valuable 
to him as a communications 
major who is not pursuing a 
career in journalism, because 
it provided him with insight 
into how news stories are 
produced.

“I 
thought 
the 
event 

was 
great; 
everyone 
was 

very 
knowledgeable 
and 

experienced in their field,” 
Robinson 
said. 
“I 
think 

that 
whistleblowing 
is 

extremely valuable and at 
times necessary if there is 
severe wrongdoing occurring 
within the government or 
corporations.”

RALLY
From Page 1

He’s going to get 
away with half 
the things he’s 

doing. People are 
regretting voting 

for him. 


On Feb. 11, after relentless 

student 
protests, 
Yale 

announced that the university 
would change the name of its 
residential college named after 
John C. Calhoun, the seventh 
vice president of the United 
States remembered for his 
racist views and as a prominent 
spokesman for slavery. While 
there have been no similar 
protests 
about 
University 

of 
Michigan 
facilities, 
we 

recognize 
that 
there 
are 

buildings on campus named 
after figures with controversial 
histories. Buildings such as C.C. 
Little — named after University 
President Clarence Cook Little, 
a proponent of eugenics — and 
Angell Hall — named after 
University 
President 
James 

Angell, who played a role in 
crafting the Chinese Exclusion 
Act — are just a few examples of 
buildings named after figures 
who deserve greater scrutiny.

While these are prominent 

examples we would expect 
to be proposed for review, 
we worry that the names 
of 
smaller 
facilities, 
such 

as Winchell House in West 
Quad — named for Alexander 
Winchell, 
a 
20th-century 

University 
professor 
of 

geology and paleontology who 
published many racist works 
— will be overlooked in the 
renaming procedure.

In 
2008, 
the 
University 

published a set of standards for 
naming campus facilities in an 
attempt to provide consistency in 
the naming process. Under these 
guidelines, 
building 
naming 

decisions are often initiated 
by the nine-member Board of 
Regents and the final decisions 
ultimately rest with them, too.

In 
addition, 
the 
current 

standards for naming campus 

facilities 
are 
somewhat 

vague in order to account 
for the complexities of the 
human 
characters 
after 

whom buildings are named. 
Because the guidelines are 
open 
to 
interpretation, we 

believe it is not only valuable, 
but necessary, to have more 
than the voices of the Board 
of Regents and President’s 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
History 
when 

making 
these 
decisions. 

Furthermore, the few people 
making 
naming 
decisions 

spend little time in campus 
buildings compared to students 
and faculty, who work and 
study in them — and therefore 
deal with the implications 
of each building’s name — 
every day. Thus, we suggest 
the University implements a 
student and faculty committee 
to work alongside those already 
involved in order to provide 
a more inclusive and more 
informed 
decision-making 

process. 
This 
is 
especially 

important for structures like 
the Biological Science Building, 
which 
is 
currently 
under 

construction and does not have 
a donor name attached. 

When deciding the name 

of a campus facility, it is 
crucial that the University 
finds the right balance in 
continuing the University’s 
history while not “honoring” 
or endorsing the past actions 
or beliefs of a discriminatory 
individual. 
We 
recognize 

that it is often hard to judge 
influential historical figures 
due to the fluidity of social 
norms over time. Moreover, if 
given enough scrutiny, there 
is potential to find something 
offensive about any building 
name or honoree.

That being said, there is 

still a moral line that should 
not be crossed. The University 
should be proactive in changing 
names of buildings named after 
individuals who were blatantly 
racist. While it is important not 
to forget the past, we believe 
that renaming a building will not 
erase the University’s history, 
but rather create a more inclusive 
environment where all students 
can feel comfortable and, in turn, 
create a productive learning 
experience. Furthermore, we 
can remove the name while still 
acknowledging the building’s 
history 
and 
maintaining 
a 

medium to recognize the flaws 
of our past.

The decision to name or 

rename 
a 
campus 
facility 

should not be taken lightly 
and we hope the University 
continues 
to 
encourage 

student 
and 
faculty 
voices 

in the matter. Right now, 
the only avenue for students 
and faculty to get involved 
is by submitting a proposal 
recommending that buildings 
be renamed. While this is a step 
in the right direction, we believe 
it is not enough. Students must 
be afforded a more tangible role 
in these processes, such as a 
committee that works alongside 
the 
Board 
of 
Regents 
and 

President’s Advisory Committee 
on University History.

Everyone involved in the 

naming 
process 
must 
be 

mindful about how we name our 
buildings, as legacies and societal 
views constantly change over 
time. While it is important 
not to erase the University’s 
history, it is crucial that the 
name of our campus buildings 
and facilities align with the 
University of Michigan’s core 
mission and values.

A

t 
this 
point 
in 
the 

semester, many of us 
find 
ourselves 
buried 

in 
midterm 
exams, 
projects 

and 
applications 

for 
internships, 

scholarships, jobs and 
summer 
programs. 

My 
experience 

is 
no 
exception. 

As 
we 
pursue 

these 
professional 

opportunities 
and 

strive 
to 
achieve 

high marks on exams 
and 
projects, 
it 

remains 
important 

to anticipate the possibility of 
failure.

Falling short in the attempt 

to achieve a goal, like getting 
a particular job or receiving a 
good grade on an assignment, 
presents us with two choices: 
A) sulk about it and move on to 
something else or B) use this 
failure as an opportunity to learn 
how to add value to a group 
without being in that role, or 
learn why our work on that 
project was insufficient and 
how we can find more success 
in our next attempt. The latter 
choice may be more difficult 
for most, as it requires us to 
be open to receiving criticism; 
however, it often is more 
rewarding in the long term. 

Learning 
to 
embrace 
the 

disappointment of not getting a 
promotion is a skill acquired after 
repeated failure. In order to move 
forward, it may be helpful to ask 
the following questions: “How 
can I add value to this business 
or organization?” “How can I 
still grow and challenge myself 
so that I can feel engaged with 
my job?” “Is the work that I do 
for this business or organization 
personally gratifying?”

The answers may not be 

immediately apparent, but if 
you are truly passionate about 
your work, the most important 
objective should be the projects 
you work on, rather than the job 
or position that you hold within 
a business or organization. For 
example, when I was denied the 
opportunity to join the executive 
board of the glee club that I’m a 
part of, I decided that instead 
of leaving the group, I could 
find other ways to contribute in 

spite of not holding the status 
that comes with being on the 
board. I am lucky to find myself 
among many members in the 

organization 
who 

have 
expressed 
a 

fondness 
for 
my 

ideas and an interest 
in 
collaborating 

with me on various 
projects. 
This 

decision 
of 
mine 

was purely driven 
by the desire to add 
value to something 
greater than myself, 
because I love what 

this organization stands for and 
believe in contributing toward 
its longevity. 

The same can be said when 

completing projects in a class 
for a grade. This past fall, I took 
a prerequisite class for declaring 
a 
major 
in 
communications 

and 
media 
studies 
called 

Communications 122 — Media 
Analysis: Concepts and Methods. 
In this class, I worked on a 
semester-long qualitative media 
research project that involved 
analyzing 
the 
manifestation 

of gender identities in two 
advertising 
campaigns: 
the 

“Dream Angels” campaign by 
Victoria’s Secret and the “Axe 
Angels” campaign by Axe.

I had worked with my GSI 

throughout the entire semester 
on crafting a unique argument, 
finding 
related 
research 
to 

compare to mine and pondering 
the suggestions of the findings of 
my research. I put hours of work 
into the project, and in spite of the 
tremendous time commitment, I 
found myself delighted with the 
work that I was doing because it 
was both interesting to me and 

relevant to a career interest of 
mine — advertising.

All 
aside, 
I 
ended 
up 

receiving a B on the project. I 
initially felt quite dissatisfied 
with that mark, because I 
believed my work and efforts 
warranted 
a 
higher 
mark. 

However, instead of choosing 
to take out my frustrations on 
my GSI or professor, I took 
it upon myself to consider 
the critique of my GSI on the 
final product. In doing so, I 
realized my shortcomings and 
where I could have analyzed 
the ads further and added 
nuance to my argument and 
conclusions, which would have 
consequently lead to a higher 
grade on the project.

Most importantly, I saw 

this as an opportunity to delve 
further into the concepts that 
I discussed and accomplish 
the most important goal of 
the 
educational 
aspect 
of 

college: to learn how to learn 
through asking questions and 
finding the answers on one’s 
own, as opposed to someone 
else offering an answer.

This brought me to a three-

step process that allowed me 
to grow as a student. First, I 
enhanced my ability to learn and 
perform at a higher level in future 
research projects. Second, I grew 
by finding an understanding of 
what my shortcomings were 
and learning from them so my 
mistakes are not repeated in 
the future. Finally, I found that 
after reviewing my work and 
the suggestions of my GSI, I was 
more gratified by the work than 
I was before, because I learned 
more about the subject and about 
myself, particularly regarding 
my logical reasoning capabilities.

Failure 
can 
serve 
as 

an ending point, but it can 
also provide a beginning, a 
context in which you have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
create 

something 
special 
and 
be 

innovative and do something 
meaningful 
that 
has 
a 

tremendous impact on you 
personally or an organization 
that you are a part of. The 
choice is yours.

Turning failure into opportunity

ZACHARY COX | COLUMN

Zachary Cox can be reached at 

coxz@umich.edu.

I 

received 
a 
book 
about 

manners two years ago as 
a Christmas present from 

a distant relative. At first, I was 
slightly 
offended; 

I took it as a subtle 
implication 
that 

this relative was not 
particularly fond of 
my behavior and I had 
somehow stepped on 
traditions of which I 
was not aware.

The book, titled 

“50 
Things 
Every 

Young Lady Should 
Know: 
What 
to 

Do, What to Say, and How to 
Behave,” is co-authored by two 
men and one woman. It made me 
cringe and I immediately placed 
it out of sight on my bookshelf. 
I did not touch it again until a 
few months ago when I dared 
to flip through a few of the 
chapters while clearing out my 
room. Curiosity killed the cat as 
I started on “Chapter 1: Saying 
‘Please,’” and I continued to read, 
wondering why I was so quick to 
dismiss basic manners simply 
because they were presented in a 
way with which I did not agree.

There 
is 
a 
negative 

connotation 
surrounding 

the idea of behavior manuals 
specifically for men and for 
women, especially among our 
generation. 
Aside 
from 
the 

binary gender division these 
books promote, the implication 
that we have to change our 
ways to accommodate traditions 
we see as somewhat archaic is 
typically labeled as sexist with 
no further thought. But we forget 
there is value in participating 
in 
certain 
mannerisms 
to 

communicate respect.

Formal etiquette is easy to 

learn, is only required in specific 
settings and is incredibly useful 
when facing situations in which 
one does not normally engage. 
Having a set behavior you know 
to be acceptable allows you to 

operate confidently with little 
worry of offending others. This 
should not be seen as “giving in” 
or forced conformity; it should 

be seen as a form of 
behavior that we can 
default to when we 
wish to convey our 
appreciation of others.

Cultures all around 

the world have set 
traditions 
in 
place 

that help define their 
way of life, and such 
framework is not to 
be 
frowned 
upon. 

Universal 
social 

interactive behavior that reflects 
common decency among people 
is the beginning of a society 
that knows how to function on 
an elementary level. We need 
this within our own culture. 
Discrimination 
still 
unjustly 

divides many places in the United 
States, and a set of manners we 
agree upon to show respect is 
one place to start the essential 
communication that moves us 
toward a more united country.

It will not be easy to define 

manners upon which we all 
agree, but millennials are key 
in designing the next set of 
manners within our society 
that express the social justice 
evolution we are experiencing 
right now. It is up to us to remove 
the oppressive behaviors that 
perpetuate gender roles and 
are unaccepting toward people 
outside of what is usually seen 
as the “traditional” lifestyle. The 
world is no longer in this state of 
mind, and our manners need to 
indicate that.

Additionally, with 90 percent 

of young adults on social media 
platforms, millennials are in 
a position to devise a new set 
of manners specifically for the 
virtual world. This is only one 
example of the many areas of our 
lives in which outdated manners 
never needed to cover, therefore 
it is up to millennials to update 

the current set of manners to 
correspond to the changes we 
are seeing.

We begin changing by not 

dismissing specific behaviors 
right away under the excuse that 
they make us uncomfortable. 
This does not mean we all need 
to go visit the nearest bookstore 
to buy the hottest manners book 
currently on the shelves and read 
the latest trends in etiquette. 
We can only learn when we are 
uncomfortable. 
Finding 
new 

ways to behave toward one 
another will inevitably step on 
some toes, but this cannot deter 
us from trying.

Many 
millennials 
will 

disregard 
manners 
as 

expectations 
unfairly 
placed 

upon 
them 
by 
society 
and 

outdated practices, but manners 
that go beyond “please” and 
“thank you” are not evil rituals 
set to defeat social progress or 
restrict our behavior. Society has 
undergone many changes, and 
our manners need to reflect that. 
Some of our old practices will no 
longer be needed or will be in 
need of an update. However, we 
cannot use this as an excuse to 
abandon all formalities.

Manners, and manner books, 

should not be seen as deliverers 
of 
misery. 
Their 
primary 

function is to communicate 
decency among friends, family, 
acquaintances and strangers. 
They give a sense of acceptance 
to all interactions between 
people, which is something 
many 
claim 
to 
strive 
for. 

Millennials are in the perfect 
position to lay the groundwork 
for our next set of manners that 
are crucial to a well-functioning 
society, so it is time to step 
up and take responsibility for 
our interactions (not just our 
actions).

Thank you for your time.

Manners aren’t just unfair expectations

FROM THE DAILY

More voices in renaming buildings
I

n recent years, college students across the country have called 
upon universities to rename campus buildings that commemorate 
individuals who have histories of supporting slavery and other racist 

and discriminatory programs and policies. The University of Michigan 
has been no exception. In 2016, University President Mark Schlissel asked 
the President’s Advisory Committee on University History to review the 
University’s policies on facility naming in light of the University’s bicentennial. 
After reviewing University policies on the matter, this committee 
recommended that a process be created to allow University community 
members to propose facility names for review to the president’s office. This 
past month, Schlissel accepted the committee’s recommendations. While 
The Michigan Daily Editorial Board commends the University for taking 
this important step, we believe the University should take a more proactive 
role in investigating problematic building names and make more of an effort 
to give students and faculty a stronger voice in the decision-making process.

Two young girls sit in a locker 

room. They are scared and unsure. 
One girl tells the other to punch 
her in the stomach — maybe that 
will suffice to abort the fetus 
growing inside of her.

This week, Basement Arts 

presents 
Ruby 
Rae 
Spiegel’s 

“Dry Land,” in Studio One at the 
Walgreen Drama Center. “Dry 
Land” tells the story of an unlikely 
friendship that forms in the face of 
a conflict in which both girls have 
to keep a secret.

Amy, a popular teenager with 

a strong personality, confides 
in Ester, an intense athlete and 
introvert, who offers Amy the 
counsel and support that she 
cannot find anywhere else.

“The whole play, except for one 

scene, takes place in the locker 
room of a girls’ swim team,” said 
Delaney Moro, Music, Theatre & 
Dance Senior, and director of the 
show. “It follows the story of these 
two girls named Amy and Ester, 
who become unlikely friends, 
basically because Amy is in a 
predicament that only someone 
like Ester can help her with — 
which is that Amy is pregnant.”

The girls go on this journey 

together, supporting one another 
through a conflict that they refuse 
to tell their classmates or parents 
about. After having read through 
the script many times, the cast 
has brought plenty of delightful 
surprises 
to 
the 
process 
of 

developing these characters. 

“For Ester, the character has 

surprised me in a lot of ways. I 
think initially when I read her, I 
didn’t give her enough credit. I 
thought of her as a very naïve girl, 
who is just this athlete with no 
friends,” Moro said.

Carly Snyder, Music, Theatre 

and Dance senior, plays Ester. She 
presents an entirely new version 
of her character, one that further 
illuminates 
the 
brilliance 
of 

this play and offers depth to the 

character as she helps her friend 
through an extremely difficult 
situation.

“When Carly came in, she 

brought this sweetness to her and 
also brought an intelligence that 
really came alive in the room,” 
Moro said.

Amy, played by Kay Kelley, 

Music, Theatre & Dance senior, is 
the figure who is battling the most 
intense conflict in 
this piece, but is 
hesitant to turn to 
anyone for help.

“Kay can take 

a 
character 
like 

Amy, who has this 
tough outer shell, 
but 
also 
show 

she is extremely 
vulnerable 
on 

the 
inside 
and 

susceptible with all 
the basic human 
emotions that we 
can come to terms 
with,” Moro said. “Especially 
when we are going through 
something traumatic, like hiding a 
pregnancy.”

The dynamic between both 

actors has added extra reward 
to this piece, as both Kelley and 
Snyder build off each other in 
beautiful ways.

“When I put them together, 

they just fed off of each other so 
well, their natural banter with the 
dialogue is something that you can 
only dream of when you have three 
weeks to put it together,” Moro 
said.

Though abortion is a politically 

sensitive topic, Moro says the 
politics of the issue do not 
overshadow the performance. =

“I don’t think I would call it a 

political play,” Moro said. “What I 
think it does so well is it presents 
this issue and it allows the audience 
to think for themselves about it. It 
doesn’t have a spin, it doesn’t have 
an idea about abortions that says: 
‘Okay this is what we think, what 
do you think?’ You can decide for 
yourself.”

The cast has engaged in multiple 

discussions about the pro-life and 
pro-choice debate, and they have 
realized that even with differing 
views, there are different ways to 
communicate ideas to an audience 
without forcing them to sway to 
one side of the spectrum. 

“I think after talking to the cast 

and really sitting with the piece for 
a while, I didn’t want to put just one 
commentary on the issue. Because 

I 
don’t 
think 

that really solves 
anything,” 
Moro 

explained. 
“We 

live in Ann Arbor, 
which is a bubble 
of people who are 
very 
likeminded, 

but that takes us 
away 
from 
the 

entire 
country, 

which is something 
I think we saw in 
November.”

“Dry 
Land” 

explores 
the 

importance of assistance and safe 
abortion care when it’s needed. 
Amy and Ester are so terrified to 
tell anyone that they go about the 
process in a highly unsafe way.

According to Moro, that is just 

one side of the issue.

“Another way to look at it — 

there’s a life. There is something 
in there … she (Amy) describes it 
as the size of a lemon. It’s shocking, 
when you actually look at it,” Moro 
said.

This play is constantly evolving, 

as the cast discovers further truths 
about friendship, hardship and 
who to turn to in the midst of such 
events. 

Supportive of the project, the 

cast is grateful that they could 
bring a piece like this to the Ann 
Arbor 
community, 
and 
they 

continue to dive into the reality 
of the situations proposed in the 
show.

“As we have gone along, every 

time we read a scene, we discover 
something new about the script,” 
Moro said. “That’s the joy of being 
an actor, you dig and you find stuff 
to keep it alive and surprise you.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

20th Century Fox

A still from Verbinski’s “A Cure for Wellness”

‘Cure’ combines genuine 
thrills with poor pacing

Verbinski’s film presents a kooky, occasionally entertaining 
movie which locates its fault in an overbearing run time 

For most of its runtime, 

“A Cure for Wellness” plays 
like a poor man’s version of 
Martin 
Scorsese’s 
“Shutter 

Island.” But where that film 
had the advantage of stellar 
source material and one of the 
greatest directors to ever live, 
“A Cure for Wellness” has Gore 
Verbinski, the man behind 
“The Lone Ranger.” That’s not 
to say that this is a bad movie. 
There is certainly plenty to like 
here, and the story — that of a 
young businessman who is sent 
to a mysterious wellness center 
to retrieve his boss — is initially 
intriguing, but the whole thing 
labors under the feeling that a 
more experienced hand could 
have polished it to the point of 
greatness.

Instead, 
“A 
Cure 
for 

Wellness” is a Verbinski film 
through 
and 
through. 
It’s 

weird. It’s creepy. And, by 
god, is it long. Clocking in at 
almost two and a half hours, 
it feels like a flick in desperate 
need of editing, particularly 
in the first act, where a steady 
stream of flashbacks disrupts 
the pacing and several scenes 
pass 
without 
contributing 

anything to character, plot or 
scares. At least in Verbinski’s 
“Pirates of the Caribbean” 
movies, 
audience 
had 
the 

swashbuckling tone and fun 
characters to gravitate towards 
when the story dragged. Here, 
there is nothing besides a 
central mystery that is too 
poorly developed to be truly 
captivating.

But even if “A Cure for 

Wellness” had asked a clear 
and intriguing question right 
off the bat, Justin Haythe’s 
(“Snitch”) script does it no 

favors. The dialogue is the 
worst 
part 
of 
the 
movie, 

as it is so on-the-nose that 
guessing the twists is all too 
easy. By the halfway point 
of the film, everything has 
been so telegraphed that later 
scenes that could have been 
surprising are robbed of their 
heft. 
Foreshadowing 
twists 

is a necessity in 
order 
to 
make 

repeat 
viewings 

that much more 
enjoyable, 
but 

Haythe crosses a 
line here.

Finally, 
at 

around 
the 

midpoint 
of 
the 

film, the pacing 
picks up and the story becomes 
interesting, allowing Verbinski 
to 
indulge 
in 
his 
most 

ridiculously weird dreams on 
screen for all to see. The first 
half isn’t entirely devoid of 
scares, for example a creepy 
scene in a steam bath, but these 
moments were drowned in the 
then-uninteresting plot. But “A 
Cure for Wellness” cuts loose 
in the second half. Verbinski 
shows able command of the 
horror, switching from gross-
out scenes to psychological 
thrills to a distinctly gothic, 
Edgar Allan Poe-influenced 
feel, oftentimes within the 
space of a single scene.

Visually, 
“A 
Cure 
for 

Wellness” 
is 
unassailable. 

Cinematographer 
Bojan 

Bazelli 
(“Pete’s 
Dragon”) 

and production designer Eve 
Stewart (“The Danish Girl”) 
construct a world that is 
simultaneously reminiscent of 
the aforementioned “Shutter 
Island,” 
yet 
something 
all 

its own. The darkness of the 
outside world clashes with 
the 
bright, 
almost 
sterile 

wellness 
center, 
giving 
it 

an 
otherworldly 
appeal. 

Even during the film’s worst 
moments, the visuals make it 
bearable.

The 
performances 
do 

the 
movie 
a 
service, 
as 

well. 
Dane 
DeHaan 
(“The 

Amazing Spider-Man 2”) gets 
progressively 
better 
as 
“A 

Cure for Wellness” goes along; 

he begins as a 
stereotypical 
young 
businessman 
who speaks in 
nothing 
but 

sanctimonious 
monologues 
and smug one-
liners and ends 
as a character 

worthy of DeHaan’s range with 
whom audiences can actually 
begin to sympathize in his fear.

The real star of the film is 

Jason Isaacs (“Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows—Part 
2”) as the head of the wellness 
center. As Dr. Heinrich Volmer, 
Isaacs infuses every line he’s 
given with the kind of creepy 
energy that much of the first 
half of the movie needed. He 
alone avoids the pitfalls of the 
dialogue to create a gloriously 
entertaining antagonist, and 
he only gets better as the film 
peels back the layers of his 
character.

Gore 
Verbinski 
makes 

weird movies. Even when the 
films are ostensibly for kids, 
like his excellent “Rango,” 
they’re 
almost 
stunningly 

kooky. “A Cure for Wellness” 
is no different. If Verbinski 
had shown the restraint with 
the runtime that he showed 
for the first half, the movie 
might have been great, but as it 
stands, his newest is a plodding 
yet occasionally entertaining 
entry into the gothic horror 
genre.

“A Cure for 
Wellness”

Rave Cinemas, 

Goodrich Quality 16

20th Century Fox

A 
pre-teen 
British 
girl 

(newcomer Madi Linnard) ditches 
school on the German military 
base where her family is stationed. 
As she walks the snow-covered 
roadside, a yellow van approaches. 
Years later, a woman (Abigail 
Hardingham, 
“Broadchurch”) 

walks perhaps the same path with 
the snow melting before reaching 
a small town and collapsing. 
Simultaneously in the past, the 
van stops and the girl disappears. 
We soon learn that the two are one 
and the same — Alice Webster — 
sharing the same improvised spider 
web tattoo. Lying in a hospital bed, 
the grown Alice mentions another 
long-missing girl, Sophie Giroux, 
and a whole new mystery unfolds.

“The Missing” is a series that 

excels when it’s able to play its two 
timelines off of each other, letting 
the past inform us about the present, 
while changes in the present make 
us speculate about what happened 
in the past. Whether it’s a change in 
a relationship or a scar that wasn’t 
there before, “The Missing” has a 
wait as it methodically fills in the 
blanks. It was this interplay that 
made the first season so intriguing 
as it continuously brought forward 
new questions and revelations, 
using each timeline to construct 
an intricate web of connections 
and deceptions that stretched out 
over nearly a decade. Meanwhile, 
the series dove into the lasting 
effects of trauma that afflicted all 
the characters involved with the 
disappearance of the young Oliver 

Hughes, the missing boy from the 
first season.

However, instead of focusing on 

Alice’s initial disappearance and 
subsequent reappearance, season 
two takes the reappearance in2014 
as a starting point and then flies 
us forward to 2016, where retired 
French detective Julien Baptiste 
(Tchéky Karyo, “The Patriot”) 
steps out of an airport into the 
scorching heat of the Middle East.

In 
addition 
to 

common 
themes 

and methods, “The 
Missing” finds its 
connective 
thread 

in 
the 
character 

of 
Baptiste, 
the 

sole returning cast 
member from the 
show’s first season. 
And 
while 
the 

first season tied up its long tale 
of mystery and grief with very 
few loose ends, it was clear that 
the wounds, both physical and 
emotional, would leave deep scars 
for all those involved. Still haunted 
by the disappearance and death of 
Oliver and the ghosts of so many 
others he’s lost over the years, 
Baptiste jumps at the new lead on 
Sophie Giroux, another case he was 
unable solve. Desperate to make 
things right, Baptiste now pursues 
this case with the same reckless 
intensity that consumed season 
one lead Tony Hughes (James 
Nesbitt, “The Hobbit” trilogy).

The hunt for those long-gone 

leads Baptiste to Iraq, a sharp 
contrast to the frigid German 
forests that dominate the exteriors 
of the 2014 mission. And while 2014 
is captured in the washed out greys 

of winter, where questions remain 
to be answered and the truth lies 
of focus, 2016 is filmed in sharp 
daylight as Baptiste moves forward, 
boldly following his instincts, in 
spite of the horrors that may lie in 
wait.

As 
Baptiste 
searches 
for 

answers, 
the 
Webster 
family 

struggles 
to 
deal 
with 
their 

daughter’s return in 2014. Led by 
patriarch Sam (David Morrissey, 

“The 
Walking 

Dead”), 
the 

Websters 
go 

through a gauntlet 
of emotions upon 
reuniting 
with 

their 
daughter. 

Disbelief, 
relief, 

uncertainty 
and 

horror grip the 
family 
as 
Alice 

recounts her captivity. Morrissey’s 
strong presence as an actor is tested 
as the military man Sam tries 
to bear the brunt of his family’s 
trials; however, by the time we 
reunite with the family in 2016, 
Sam looks tired with a large burn 
scar covering the right side of his 
body — a man worn down by years 
of hardship. The rest of the family, 
including mother Gemma (Keeley 
Hawes, “The Casual Vacancy”) 
and son Matthew (Jack Davies, 
“Cyberbully”), is equally up to the 
task in conveying the wear and tear 
of time.

Ending on two gut punch twists, 

“The Missing” ’s season premiere 
forces us to rethink everything 
we’ve just seen as the truth again 
slips through the cracks and the 
characters are left to pick up the 
pieces. 

‘The Missing’ brings new 
mysteries and emotions

6 — Tuesday, February 21, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

With 
an 
impressive 

repertoire of work, including 
the infamous alternative cover 
of Taylor Swift’s 1989, 15 solo 
albums and a stint as member 
of alternative country band 
Whiskeytown, 
Ryan 
Adams 

is perhaps one of the most 
overlooked solo artists of 2017.

Following his 2016 divorce 

from “This Is Us” actress 
Mandy Moore, Adams released 
a statement saying he had over 
80 songs influenced by his 
divorce, ultimately selecting 12 
tracks to comprise Prisoner. 

Influenced by folk, country 

and rock, Adams brings the best 
elements of each to his work. The 
harmonica unique to folk, the 
twang that nods to country and 
the grit that is rock intertwine 
in each track, making his music 
both stylistically distinct and 
coherent.

But 
while 
his 
music 
is 

enjoyable 
and 
the 
album 

is 
emotionally 
felt, 
Adams 

ultimately falls prey to what 
most singer-songwriters are 
victim to: redundancy.

Although each isolated track 

is lyrically and instrumentally 
superior to most music that 
infiltrates 
the 
mainstream, 

when 
pieced 
together 
and 

listened to as a whole, it 
becomes hard to notice what 
precisely is that great about it.

Three songs are undoubtedly 

great whether listened to stand-
alone or on the 
album as a whole; 
the two opening 
tracks, “Do You 
Still Love Me?” 
and 
“Prisoner,” 

as well as one of the final songs, 
“Broken Away.”

“Do You Still Love Me?” 

opens with an ethereal organ 
solo and is abruptly stabbed 
with an 80s-esque guitar riff. 
Adams comes in with raw, 
gritty, angry vocals, beautifully 
juxtaposing the demure organ 
moment with sudden passion 
— perhaps a metaphor for 
his failed relationship with 
Moore. 
The 
unique 
vocals 

and instrumentation are met 
with equally as realized lyrics: 
“Another year will pass / I will 
count the days / Another sun 
goes down / And I’ll never see 
the rays / What can I say? / I 
didn’t want it to change / Is 
my heart blind and our love so 

strange? / Do you still love me, 
babe?”

Moving into the title track, 

“Prisoner,” Adams takes a less 
angry and passionate approach 
in favor of slowing down the 
tempo, utilizing softer lyrics and 
vocals to convey his message 
of lost love. Similarly, “Broken 

Away” 
begins 

instrumentally 
stripped, 
showcasing 
Adams’ 
lyrics 

and quiet vocals, 

gradually 
building 
with 

increased instrumentation and 
a more powerful sound on his 
end. Despite the blending of 
each track, Prisoner remains 
an enjoyable listen. It paints 
vignettes of love and loss, 
marriage 
and 
divorce 
and 

the trials and tribulations of 
moving on. Sometimes it can be 
easy to get caught up in finding 
the perfect album with songs 
unlike any other, but at the 
end of the day, it’s more than 
that. This album is about a man 
telling his side of heartbreak 
— whether or not each track 
is Grammy-worthy is almost 
irrelevant — what’s relevant 
is the lyrics; the sound is just 
extra.

From Herrera to Yeezy: 
NYFW 2017 at a glance

Style writer Tess Tobin analyzes and critiques the various 
clothing lines brought to us by NYFW prominent designers

“I think the strongest message 

[of this week] was looking at 
the American woman in a very 
universal way, and looking at 
fashion in a very inclusive way. 
It was really a celebration of 
women from all walks of life and 
from all backgrounds.” – Anna 
Wintour, to Vogue.com

New York Fashion Week 

houses the most diversified 
assortment of shows. While 
reoccurring trends surfaced, 
it 
is 
nearly 
impossible 
to 

categorize the conglomeration 
of designers that showcase 
their 
work 
in 
New 
York. 

Each of the 180 shows of this 
season demonstrated a distinct 
interpretation of “The New 
York woman,” and American 
fashion.

Below are reviews from four 

shows scattered on opposite 
ends the spectrum of NYFW.

Carolina Herrera:
Beautiful but bland. Crisp 

nice silhouettes, but nothing 
particularly enthusing. Herrera 
is not a designer that typically 
aims to push boundaries or 

break new ground, and that 
bears no inherent wrongdoing. 
Instead 
she 
strives 
for 

predictable 
excellence. 

However, this collection fell 
a little short. It was not bad 
so much as it was not as good 
as her usual. That being said, 
I would not be surprised if 
the penultimate look, a navy 
tulle and sequin gown with 
a Victorian collar, makes an 
appearance on a red carpet 
sometime soon.

Proenza Schouler:
With 
a 
bang. 
Proenza 

Schouler’s Ready to Wear Fall 
2017 collection was their final 
NYFW show, as they have 
announced they are making the 
move to Paris. This collection 
was marked by many different 
reoccurring style motifs, such 
as cut-outs, wrap effect and 
oversized outerwear. And in 
all, served as an excellent final 
bow, with each look destined to 
be worn by New York’s coolest.

Delpozo:
For 
a 
ready 
to 
wear 

collection, Delpozo is fairly 
unwearable. The clothes are 
immensely 
architectural, 

to the point where jackets 
resemble sculptures. But they 

are as brilliant as they are 
batty. Delpozo’s collection was 
vibrant, fun and meticulously 
executed. Every silhouette was 
obviously carefully planned. 
What’s more, the collection 
was rich both in terms of 
ornate fabric and indulgent 
colors. You’ll have to forgive 
my alliteration, but frankly, it 
was festive, fancy and fabulous. 
A wonderful respite from this 
season’s prevalent grayscale.

Yeezy:
Definitely better, still not 

good. I must applaud Kanye 
what was truly an intelligent 
decision: toning himself down. 
Fashion loves a spectacle, but 
it does not love Kanye. A fact 
made very clear after editors 
absolutely lampooned him post 
Yeezy Season 4 fiasco. This 
collection was genuinely low 
key, devoid of Kanye’s fanfare. 
The relaxed setting allowed 
for New York’s fashion elite 
to focus on the clothes, except 
there was not a whole lot to 
appreciate. Some looks were 
strong, particularly those with 
outwear. However, it seemed 
like Kanye styled clothes one 
could find elsewhere as opposed 
to designing anything novel.

A still from Almodóvar’s “Julieta” 
‘Julieta’ does everything 
right, but still goes wrong

Almodóvar’s emotional film fails to captivate the entire heart

“Julieta,” a Spanish-language 

movie 
directed 
by 
Pedro 

Almodóvar, is a bit of a paradox. It’s 
an emotionally rich and satisfying 
story encompassing a lifetime’s 
worth of pain, grief, love and 
longing, and yet, it’s not exactly 
a “feelings” movie. It doesn’t 
connect with viewers at their 
core; it doesn’t leave its audience 
thinking and pondering over it 
after it’s done.

All the building blocks of a 

beautiful story are technically 
there. “Julieta” is told largely 
in flashback. The older Julieta 
writes the story of her life as a 
young woman when she met the 
love of her life, Xoan, on a train. 
The older Julieta chronicles their 
early days, their joy at the birth 
of their daughter and the tragedy 
that struck their lives when Xoan 
drowned in a boating accident. 
Julieta fell into a deep depression, 
leaving only her daughter, Antía, to 
take care of her. The older, present 
day Julieta is estranged from her 
daughter, leaving her wracked 
with guilt and grief. 

Actresses Emma Suárez (“¿Para 

qué sirve un oso?”) and Adriana 
Ugarte (“Palm Trees in the Snow”) 
play the older and younger Julieta, 
respectively, and both turn in 
gorgeous performances. Suárez 

can break your heart with the 
tiniest movements around her 
eyes, the smallest uptick in the 
pitch of her voice. When we meet 
Julieta at the start of the film, she is 
almost entirely alone in the world, 
and this is communicated almost 
entirely through the visual style 
of the filmmaking and through 
Suárez’s performance. But Ugarte 
might have the more difficult task, 
in regard to acting. She takes us 
through 
Julieta’s 

transformation 
from 
the 
most 

charismatic person 
in any given room 
into a deeply sad 
and broken woman. Together, the 
two actresses paint a portrait of a 
complete and complex character, 
one who holds a sort of fragile 
inner strength that’s as delicate as 
it is powerful.

Almodóvar creates a striking 

visual world for Julieta to live 
in — primary colors stand out, 
richly 
saturated 
against 
the 

Spanish seas and mountains. It’s 
all accompanied with a lush and 
graceful score by Alberto Iglesias 
(“Exodus: 
Gods 
and 
Kings”). 

The movie is rich with detail and 
lovingly made, all with the intent 
of submerging the viewer into 
the emotional world of Julieta, to 
empathize with her as fully as we 
possibly can.

It works, for the most part. 

Julieta is a character that many 

other stories would villainize or 
cast aside as pathetic and spineless 
— the depressed, absent mother 
unable to be there for her children. 
In “Julieta,” we’re forced into her 
head to really understand her, 
flaws and all. But even with its 
beautiful performances, stunning 
cinematography and emotionally 
dense subject matter, “Julieta” 
leaves the viewer feeling cold.

Maybe 
it’s 
the 
flashback 

structure that holds 
us at a distance. 
Maybe it’s the rapid 
pace that doesn’t 
give us enough time 
to 
be 
immersed 

in what’s happening beyond the 
surface 
level 
plot 
mechanics. 

Maybe it’s both. Either way, there’s 
something embedded in the film’s 
core construction that doesn’t 
leave enough room for the feelings 
it so desperately wants to explore to 
resonate with the audience. To wit: 
In my showing of “Julieta,” the end 
of the film was not accompanied by 
a stunned silence or a roomful of 
crying people, but of a widespread 
muttering of “wait, that’s it?” and 
“oh, okay, it’s over.”

It’s not a bad movie, not even 

close. I would say it’s actually a 
lovely movie, wonderful to look at, 
and made by incredibly talented 
people. Everything on the surface 
is just right — beautiful and soulful 
and engaging. Beneath the glossy 
surface, though, is a hollow core.

Michigan completes 
shutout over Baylor

Junior 
Mira 
Ruder-Hook 

drove her shot deep into the 
court, catching her opponent 
off guard and forcing her to 
hit it wide. Though the match 
had been 
clinched 
for 
a 

while, 
Ruder-Hook’s win meant the 
Wolverines had swept their 
dual match against Baylor, 7-0.

While 
Michigan 
was 
in 

control during the singles, 
earning the doubles point did 
not 
come 
as 

easily. The No. 
3 doubles duo 
was the first off 
the court with a 
quick 6-2 win. 
Then the battle 
was on to see 
who could give 
the Wolverines 
an 
advantage 

going 
into 

singles play.

Ultimately, the No. 2 doubles 

pair of sophomore Brienne 
Minor and Ruder-Hook won 
their match, 6-4, clinching 
the doubles point for the 
Wolverines. Minor returned a 
serve with a sharp backhand 
down the line, forcing her 
opponent to hit the ball into 
the net for the match-deciding 
point.

“We got a little bit of a slow 

start in the doubles, but we got 
it going,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni 
Bernstein. 
“Singles 

was really good, I feel like we 
competed really hard.”

Michigan 
rode 
its 

momentum straight into the 
singles matches. Sophomore 
Kate Fahey was the first off the 
court with a 6-0, 6-0 win at the 
No. 1 spot.

The score may not reflect 

it, 
but 
the 
match 
wasn’t 

easy for Fahey. She made 
many unforced errors in an 
attempt to stay aggressive, but 
fortunately for the Wolverines, 
it didn’t matter. 

Minor had the chance to 

take the first set in her match 
6-0, but couldn’t close it out. 
She allowed Baylor’s Theresa 
Van Zyl to get two late games, 
but eventually took the first 
set, 6-2.

She cruised through the 

second set and took advantage 
of Van Zyl being out of position 
after a wide serve. She crushed 
a backhand down the line and 

celebrated 
before the ball 
even 
hit 
the 

line.

“I just came 

out there and 
was 
like 
‘I’m 

gonna win this 
match,’ ” Minor 
said. 
“I 
just 

wanted to go for 
my shots and 
get to the net 

and play my game.”

Even 
Michigan’s 
newest 

players were able to earn 
victories on Sunday. Freshmen 
Valeria 
Patiuk 
and 
Chiara 

Lommer 
both 
took 
their 

matches in two sets, winning 
6-2, 
6-1, 
and 
6-4, 
6-3, 

respectively.

The Wolverines were excited 

about their victory, but are still 
hungry for more. The score 
may be deceiving because it 
wasn’t a complete dominant 
performance, and Michigan 
knows it needs to make some 
changes going into the rest of 
the season.

“We just have to go match by 

match,” Bernstein said. “We’re 
not going to win them all and 
we’ll have to be able to bounce 
back. Overall, I’m happy with 
how we played today.”

WOMEN’S TENNIS

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Ruder-Hook adjusts 
mental focus in win

Looking 
to 
bounce 
back 

from a recent blemish at No. 5 
Ohio State, the No. 10 Michigan 
women’s tennis team (7-2) hosted 
Baylor (6-1) on Sunday. Despite 
the Wolverines’ recent loss, 
the atmosphere in the Varsity 
Tennis Center was spirited from 
the start of doubles play.

Sandwiched 
between 
the 

number one and number three 
doubles 
teams, 
junior 
Mira 

Ruder-Hook 
and 
sophomore 

Brienne Minor have been rock-
solid for Michigan this season. 
Coming off an 
undefeated 
weekend at the 
ITA 
National 

Team 
Indoor 

Championship, 
they 
did 
not 

disappoint 
Sunday in the 
Wolverines’ 7-0 
victory.

After 

breaking 
their 

opponents’ serve, the duo was 
up 3-1, but squandered three 
straight games to go down 4-3. 
With the eighth game going to 
deuce and essentially deciding 
the match, Ruder-Hook took 
matters into her own hands, 
chased down a defensive lob 
from the Bears and forced 
Baylor to attempt another shot.

The shot died into the net.
With the pair up 5-4, the 10th 

game came down to another 
nerve-wracking deuce point. 
Minor 
drilled 
a 
backhand 

shot directly at one of the 
opponents, which was too hot 
to handle, causing the crowd 
to erupt in elation. The tandem 
went on to win the match, 6-4, 
and solidify the doubles point 
for Michigan. 

Ruder-Hook 
believes 
the 

key to capitalizing on these 
situations is more of a mental 
task.

“I honestly think it’s not 

thinking 
about 
it,” 
Ruder-

Hook said. “Just acting like it’s 
a love-all point. I love playing 
with (Minor) so it’s more just 
playing our game right, (to) 
move forward and try to get 
forehands.”

Securing the doubles point for 

the team was important going 
into singles play, something 
the Wolverines failed to do in 
Columbus on Friday.

Ruder-Hook’s singles match 

seemed to follow a similar 
storyline to her doubles bout, 
as she started out hot in the 
first set, taking a 5-2 lead. But 
Baylor’s Angelina Shakhraichuk 
won two straight games to 

close the gap. 
Here, 
Ruder-

Hook 
showed 

growth 
from 

her experience 
against 
Ohio 

State. 
Instead 

of focusing on 
her 
struggles, 

she 
powered 

through to win 
the first set and 
eventually 
the 

match, 6-4, 6-3.

“I definitely feel like I’m 

more focused on my mental 
game,” Ruder-Hook said. “I 
feel like playing Ohio State was 
really great because we got to 
see what we needed to work 
on and what to improve on. I 
focused on my serve and getting 
up to the ball and coming to the 
net because that’s what I didn’t 
do against the Buckeyes.”

Although 
Ruder-Hook 

changed some tactical aspects of 
her game, she was very pleased 
with how her mental game was 
improving.

“It was more just like mentally 

being a little bit more precise 
on what I’m doing, intentional 
about what I’m doing,” Ruder-
Hook said.

With 
her 
mental 
game 

becoming more reliable, Ruder-
Hook is ready to lead her team, 
as they head into their spring 
break trip to California, where 
they will play USC on March 3. 

Michigan players reflect on their first goals

When 
Joseph 
Cecconi 

received the puck off a faceoff, 
there was nobody between 
him and Wisconsin goaltender 
Matt Jurusik.

In the midst of a 3-2 game 

between 
the 
Badgers 
and 

the Michigan hockey team 
on 
Saturday, 

the 
sophomore 

defenseman 
didn’t hesitate to 
pull the trigger. 
He shot the puck, 
and despite the 
lack of traffic in 
front of Jurusik, 
it found the back 
of the net.

It was the first 

goal of Cecconi’s 
career, and all of the other 
Wolverines on the ice swarmed 
him as he threw both hands 
in the air. All except senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong, 
that is. He skated toward the 
referee with his bare hand 
outstretched, asking for the 
puck so he could give it to 
Cecconi to keep.

This is the usual routine for 

when players score their first 
collegiate goal.

“I think it’s more of an 

instinctual thing when you’re 
a senior,” said senior forward 
Alex Kile. “I feel like every time 
someone’s scored this year, if 
it’s their first goal, someone 
made sure they grabbed (the 
puck) right away, and make the 
guy happy.”

Kile has seen both sides of 

this tradition for himself. On 
Dec. 15, he assisted freshman 
forward Jake Slaker for his first 
career goal, and on Dec. 29, 
he did the same for freshman 
forward Adam Winborg.

Both times he was the one 

asking the referee for the puck 
to give to a first-time scorer.

On Nov. 22 in the 2013-14 

season, Kile scored his first 
career goal against Niagara.

“I just kind of played it off,” 

Kile said. “On the replay, I just 
kind of throw my hands up in 
the air — no big celebration or 

anything. I was just kind of 
more frustrated that it took me 
nine games to score.”

That type of celebration is 

standard across the players’ 
varied 
experiences, 
too. 

Cecconi said after his goal that 
he wasn’t “going to go down 
and do the nice celebration like 
some of the forwards do.”

Yet, for some, their first 

career 
goal 

isn’t 
always 

a 
happy 

occasion — as 
was the case 
for 
freshman 

defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce. 

On 
Feb. 
11, 

with 
just 
10 

seconds 
left 

in the game, 
he 
scored 

against Michigan State, but the 
Wolverines were already losing 
by four goals.

For Luce, the experience 

was a mix of emotions.

“Obviously I was excited for 

myself,” Luce said. “… But at 
the same time, in a game like 
that, with (10) seconds left, I 
mean it doesn’t really make a 
difference in the game. Later 
on, actually, I saw that it was 
their goalie’s first win, so I was 
kind of happy that I spoiled his 
shutout.”

Because of the situation, 

though, 
Luce’s 
goal 
didn’t 

warrant as much 
of a celebration. 
In 
fact, 

nobody 
went 

and 
grabbed 

the 
puck 
for 

him. 
Instead, 

equipment 
manager 
Ian 

Hume found the 
puck 
for 
him 

afterward.

That is the 

main thing all of the players 
have in common. No matter 
where their first goal was 
scored, or in what situation, 
all of them have kept the puck 
or given it to a close family 

member. Kile’s resides in his 
house in Troy, Mich., Luce 
keeps his in his dorm room, 
and Cecconi mentioned that 
he wanted to give his to his 
father or grandfather once he 
got home.

“It’s good to get that weight 

off your shoulders,” Kile said. 
“I know, at times, people don’t 
score after a certain amount of 

time, and they 
kind of just have 
that weight on 
their 
shoulder, 

so 
I’m

There 
is 

still 
more 

opportunity for 
first goals this

Michigan players still haven’t 
scored. And if they do manage 
to find the back of the net, one 
thing is certain: the puck and 
the memory will be with them 
forever.

Three-point shooting, defense haunt ‘M’ 

One week ago, the Michigan 

women’s basketball team was 
ranked No. 20 in the Associated 
Press poll, riding a six-game win 
streak and boasting a 10-2 Big 
Ten record — the best start to 
conference play in school history. 

Since then, things have taken 

a turn for the worse for the 
twenty-fifth ranked Wolverines 
(10-4 Big Ten, 21-7 overall). 
After a 72-61 loss at Indiana 
last Thursday, a game in which 
the Wolverines trailed by as 
many as 23 in the second half, 
Michigan was routed at Crisler 
Center 
on 
Sunday 
by 
rival 

Michigan State, 86-68. Given the 
season’s previous successes, the 
current slump has caught many 
onlookers by surprise.

“Michigan State and Indiana 

right now are fighting for their lives 
to make the NCAA Tournament,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico following Sunday’s defeat. 
“They (both) came out and played 
incredibly tough, incredibly hard 
and were able to make a lot of 
shots. That made it difficult for us 
to come back.”

A close examination of the 

numbers, though, reveals a clear 
picture as to why the Wolverines 
dropped their past two contests.

The most glaring figure is 

the percentage of 3-point shots 
Michigan is making. Prior to 
the loss to the Hoosiers, the 
Wolverines were shooting 40.8 
percent from behind the arc 
— which was the best in the 
country.

Against 
Indiana, 
Michigan 

made just 27.3 percent of its 
threes, including an abysmal 
1-for-8 stretch in the first half. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
long-range 

woes were even worse against 
the Spartans, as they shot 17.6 
percent from beyond the arc and 
failed to make a single 3-pointer 
in the second half. Michigan 
now ranks fourth in the country 
in 3-point percentage, averaging 
39.6 percent from long range.

“We’re accustomed to making 

(threes) so much that it’s almost 
one pass and a fire, instead of let’s 
move it, move it, move it,” Barnes 
Arico said, “and maybe get the 
best shot instead of the first shot. 
What’s happening is that we’re 
taking the quick shot and the 
other team is coming down and 

scoring. Then we’re taking a quick 
shot and not making them defend 
and the lead is growing instead of 
getting smaller.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
shooting 

troubles have had much to do 
with normally reliable scorers 
going through uncharacteristic 
slumps. Junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, who has made 38.9 
percent of her threes during her 
career, failed to sink a single 
3-pointer in 10 tries over the last 
two games. Freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick, herself a 47.3 
percent 3-point shooter, went a 
combined 2-for-14 from behind 
the arc in the last two games.

Flaherty was able to make up 

for her inaccuracy from distance 
on Thursday, as she sank eight of 
her 18 shots from the floor and 
tallied 23 points. But on Sunday, 
she went just 2-for-12 from 
2-point range and mustered just 
four points, her lowest total in 
two years.

“I don’t think Flaherty had 

an easy look at all today, she had 
to work for everything,” Barnes 
Arico said on Sunday. “We have 
to, as a program and as coaches, 
try to get her some easier looks 
— try to run some things where 

maybe she’s going to get an open 
look.”

Defense was also an issue for 

Michigan, particularly against 
Michigan State. The Wolverines 
allowed the Spartans to make 58.3 
percent of their field goals and 50 
percent of their 3-pointers. Guard 
Tori Jankoska abused Michigan’s 
defense the most, making 10 of 
her 16 shots en route to a 28-point 
outing.

The Wolverines did not have 

nearly the same defensive woes 
against Indiana, as the Hoosiers 
sank 46.4 percent of their field 
goals and shot 36.8 percent from 
3-point range. Michigan even 
managed to hold Indiana to one 
3-pointer in eight tries in the 
second half of the game.

Yet forward Amanda Cahill 

and guard Tyra Buss still had 
their way with the Wolverines’ 
defense. Cahill notched a double-
double against Michigan, totaling 
15 points and 12 rebounds, while 
Buss recorded 21 points.

The 
good 
news 
for 
the 

Wolverines is that their next two 
opponents — Nebraska (2-12, 
6-20) and Penn State (8-6, 18-8) 
— are both ranked outside of the 
top 50 in the Ratings Percentage 
Index. Even better for Michigan 
is the fact that the Cornhuskers 
boast the worst scoring defense 
in the Big Ten, allowing 75.9 
points per game. It would appear 
that Nebraska presents a golden 
opportunity for the Wolverines to 
get their 3-point shooting back on 
track.

But 
Barnes 
Arico 
quickly 

brushed aside any notion that 
she views the Cornhuskers as an 
easy opponent, especially given 
the fact that they defeated the 
Hoosiers, 67-64, on Sunday.

“We always tell our kids, ‘Play 

for the team on the front of our 
jersey, and not the opponent,’ 
” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“(The 

Cornhuskers) have no pressure 
on them. They’re loose, they’re 
carefree. They’re going to come 
in here and say, ‘Hey let’s upset 
Michigan.’ That would make their 
season.”

Lin, Michigan go down to the 
wire to beat No. 15 Kentucky

Kentucky’s 
Enzo 
Wallart 

prepared to return a serve from 
Michigan junior Carter Lin in 
the right corner of the backcourt. 
Wallart struck the return and the 
ball torpedoed back over the net, 
landing just outside of the singles’ 
sideline. Lin dropped to his knees 
and the rest of the Michigan 
men’s tennis team rushed the 
court, piling on top of each other 
and tackling the No. 6 singles 
player as the crowd at the Varsity 
Tennis Center erupted.

In the final match of the day, 

with the two teams tied at three, 
Lin propelled the 18th-ranked 
Wolverines to a 4-3 victory in 
a thrilling third-set tiebreaker 
over the 15th-ranked Wildcats on 
Saturday.

“That’s why I play college 

tennis,” Lin said. “That feeling 
is amazing. Big points and big 
matches like this, having the 
whole team with you. Having 

that pressure, I like it. It’s a good 
feeling.”

The win gave Michigan (6-1) 

its third victory over a ranked 
opponent this season — a major 
improvement from just two years 
ago, when the team went 1-7 
against ranked competition.

“We’ve come a long way from 

two years ago,” said Michigan 
coach Adam Steinberg. “It’s a lot 
(of emotion). It’s great to see these 
guys have these types of wins and 
enjoy all the hard work they put 
in.

“It’s just a lot. We’ve just 

started from ground zero and 
look where we are. A million 
things go through your head and 
to see Carter win (the match) like 
that and the guys enjoy (it), that’s 
what it’s all about.”

In the decisive, match-winning 

No. 6 singles matchup, Lin 
and Wallart stayed fairly even. 
Wallart took the first set 7-5, and 
Lin countered with a 7-5 win in 
the second frame. Lin never led 
in the third set until the game-

clinching 
tiebreaker, 
battling 

back from 0-1, 1-3, 3-4, 4-5 and 
5-6 deficits.

It was a hotly-contested match 

that saw the Kentucky coaching 
staff argue against several of 
the 
officials’ 
decisions, 
with 

the height of the disagreement 
coming when Wallart received a 
code violation for arguing a call 
that gave Lin his second point and 
moved the third set to a 2-3 score.

“The one thing he did really 

well was he made me earn every 
single point,” Lin said. “He didn’t 
really give me any free points. … 
He just gave me a tough time. He 
fought like crazy.”

Sophomore Myles Schalet and 

junior Alex Knight also added 
singles points for the Wolverines. 
The 
afternoon’s 
narrative 
of 

resilience and endurance was 
representative in both matches, 
with 
Schalet 
quickly 
falling 

behind 0-2 in the first set and 
Knight trailing 1-3 in the second 
set of his match. The two would 
both come back, earning victories 
in the No. 2 and No. 5 singles 
matchups, respectively.

The doubles point ended up 

being the difference maker in the 
match, which Michigan earned 
with victories in No. 1 doubles 
— from senior Jathan Malik and 
freshman Connor Johnston — 
and No. 3 doubles — from Schalet 
and senior Kevin Wong. The 
Wolverines won both matches 
assuredly with 6-2 scores.

“I feel like we have found the 

right matchups,” Steinberg said 
of the team’s doubles pairings. 
“It’s not 100 percent yet, but I feel 
like those three teams (are) good 
at every position. We feel like we 
can win at 1, 2, or 3.”

Above 
everything 
else, 

Saturday’s emotional rollercoaster 
provided the team with a marquee, 
season-defining victory.

“This is a lot. This is our best 

win of the year without a doubt,” 
Steinberg said. “Two of the 
next three matches are against 
top-10 teams, so this is a great 
springboard for that. We needed 
this, this is the next step in our 
program.”

Late-game losses becoming Michigan’s biggest burden

M

INNEAPOLIS 
— If there’s one 
consistency Michigan 

has shown throughout its wildly 
inconsistent season, it’s that no 
deficit is too large to overcome. 

In 

countless 
games, the 
Wolverines 
had been 
able to dig 
themselves 
out of the 
holes they 
created. 
Against 
Texas, Penn 
State and 
Wisconsin, Michigan faced 
second-half deficits that had 
the Wolverines under immense 
pressure, just a crack away from 
breaking. Michigan bent to its 
limit, but never broke, and that 
sort of resiliency has been a 
defining characteristic of the 
Wolverines all season.

But as great as Michigan’s 

mental fortitude has been, it 
isn’t always good enough. For 
every one time the Wolverines 
have been able to overcome 
those sorts of deficits, it feels 
like they’ve fallen short two 
times more.

Michigan has 10 losses on 

its record — seven of which 
by single digits, five of which 
the Wolverines had a second-
half lead and three of which 
Michigan had the ball with the 
chance to win or extend the 
game on the final possession.

To put it simply, the 

Wolverines shouldn’t be a 
10-loss team. They have too 
much experience, talent and 
endurance to keep on fumbling 
these late-game situations, 
or even be in them in the first 
place.

Sunday night was the latest 

episode of the late-game 
horror show Michigan has 
been putting on all season, 

and it encapsulated all of the 
Wolverines’ struggles.

For 35 minutes, Michigan 

and Minnesota were in a 
jabbing match, 
exchanging 
buckets and 
leads on every 
possession. That 
all changed 
when a technical 
foul called on 
the Wolverines’ 
bench and a 
four-point play 
extended the 
Golden Gophers’ 
lead to eight with under three 
minutes to go.

With its back up against 

the tallest wall it has faced 
all season, Michigan came up 
with the right combination of 

explosiveness, calmness and 
determination to avoid complete 
collapse in the moment, and 
come up with a response. 

Between senior 
guard Derrick 
Walton Jr, 
sophomore 
forward 
Moritz Wagner 
and redshirt 
sophomore 
forward DJ 
Wilson, the 
Wolverines went 
on a 12-4 run, 
culminating in 

Wilson’s last-second three to 
send the game to overtime.

The Wolverines had climbed 

out of another seemingly 
insurmountable hole and 
had five minutes to use that 

momentum to make Minnesota 
pay for leaving the door open.

“We thought once it got to 

overtime, the game was ours,” 
Walton said. “We 
were making 
the right plays, 
and down the 
stretch, even 
though a lot of 
stuff didn’t go 
our way, we still 
got a chance to 
win.”

But everything 

that went right 
for Michigan 
in the final two minutes of 
regulation went wrong in 
overtime. The Wolverines 
opened with two turnovers, 
missed two 3-pointers and saw 
junior guard Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman come up empty 
from a trip to the free throw 
line.

Michigan melted in crunch 

time again, 
after it played 
some of its best 
basketball to get 
there.

That final 

eight-minute 
stretch captured 
what could be the 
most regrettable 
trend the 
Wolverines have 
developed and 

struggled to correct all season.

Michigan has shown time and 

again that it’s capable of putting 
up points in a hurry when it 
absolutely needs to. But in other 
situations, the Wolverines have 

shown a harmful tendency 
to freeze on offense when it 
matters most.

That began way back in 

November against Virginia 
Tech, when Michigan scored 
just five points in the final 
five minutes to give away the 
game. In Iowa, the Wolverines 
had the ball in a tie game with 
16 seconds left, only to turn 
it over before getting a shot 
off. Wisconsin held Michigan 
scoreless at the Kohl Center 
for over four minutes while it 
rattled off 15 unanswered points 
towards the end of the game.

The Wolverines had the 

chance to step on their 
opponents’ throats and put 
each of these games away 
with relative ease. Riding the 
adrenaline from Wilson’s shot, 
they could have done the same 
at Minnesota.

But Michigan let another 

golden opportunity to close out a 
win slip away against the Golden 
Gophers, and those missed 
chances are starting to compile 
for the Wolverines.

NCAA Tournament teams 

are expected to know and show 
that they can finish close games, 
and Michigan hasn’t done a 
good enough job of convincing 
anyone it can do that against 
good teams.

If the Wolverines continue to 

collect these late-game losses, 
their Selection Sunday could 
become a reflection on “what 
if” rather than a celebration of 
“what’s next.”

With that in mind, Michigan’s 

bubble status will have this team 
feeling like its back is against 
the wall from here on out. If 
there’s one thing we know about 
the Wolverines, it’s that they 
respond best when there’s no 
other option.
