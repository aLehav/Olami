'U' seeks new DP Sexecutive
direc tor WithMagee on leave

Provost hopes a vote
on the proposal will
be made by spring
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily NewsEditor
University Provost Philip
Hanlon's proposal to lengthen
the tenure probationary period
for faculty is one step closer to
becoming University policy.
In an
e-mail Michigan Daily
acquired by EXCLUSIVE
The Michi-
gan Daily, Hanlon wrote to fac-
ulty members on Friday that
he will bring the proposal to
extend the tenure probationary
period from eight to 10 years
forward today for public com-
ment - a necessary step for any
change in the University's Board
of Regents' Bylaws.
After two weeks of public
comment, the proposed bylaw
change could be brought before
the regents for a final vote.
According to the e-mail, Han-
lon hopes to bring the proposal
before the regents for a vote this
spring.
The proposed change would
alter Regent Bylaw 5.09 and

would allow any school or col-
lege within the University a
maximum of 10 years to grant
tenure to faculty members.
Decisions to alter the tenure
probationary period would still
be up to the governing faculty in
any given school or college.
All schools and colleges
within the University currently
have tenure probationary peri-
ods between six and eightyears.
Only the Medical School, Ross
School of Business, School of
Education, School of Dentistry
and Taubman College of Archi-
tecture and Urban Planning use
the full eight years.
In the e-mail to faculty
members, Hanlon wrote that
a number of issues. caused the
University and Office of the
Provost to consider lengthening
the tenure probationary period
from the current eight-year
limit established by the regents
in 1944.
Specifically, Hanlon men-
tioned the evolution of science,
engineering and community-
basedresearch,whichallrequire
tremendous amounts of time
and resources to undertake. He
added that familial structures
have changed- often making
it difficult for faculty members

After medical
absence, current
DPS director not
expected to return
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
The University is now look-
ing for a new Department of
Public Safety executive director,
according to a University job list-

ing that was posted on Thursday.
DPS Police Captain Joe Pier-
sante was named interim public
safety director after Ken Magee,
the current DPS executive direc-
tor, went on sick leave, according
to University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald. Piersante was named
interim director because Uni-
versity officials initially weren't
sure if Magee would return,
Fitzgerald said in an interview
on Friday.
"We do not expect him to
return to that position," Fitzger-

ald said. "So that's why the posi-
tion has been posted."
He added that University offi-
cials waited until they were cer-
tain Magee wouldn't be coming
back to post before listingthe job
onthe University's website.
During the public comments
section at the University's
Board of Regents meeting last
month, former University Prof.
Douglas Smith said he believes
Magee is on leave because
of sexual misconduct allega-
tions. Smith requested access

from the regents to documents
detailing allegations against
Magee - records Smith said he
was previously denied based on
attorney-client privilege.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman would not com-
ment on Magee's situation fol-
lowingthe meeting.
At the time, Fitzgerald said
there was no investigation into
the matter.
Fitzgerald said Friday that
he had no comment about the

Professors at Michigan
State University have dis-
covered that depression and
recruitment for employment
are the most likely reasons
students drop out of college,
according to a Feb. 17 State
News article.
The recent study exam-
ined survey results from
students at a variety of
American universities. Stu-
dents were asked questions
at orientation and at the end
of their first term about what
would affect their decision
to leave college, the article
states.
The researchers said in
the article the results were

surprising because they
thought other issues, like
death in the family or drug
addiction, would be leading
causes of students ceasing
their studies at a university.
LASERS HELP UC-
BERKELEY SCIENTISTS
MEASURE EARTH
Recent developments in
lasers have allowed physi-
cists at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley to better
study Earth's magnetic field,
according to a Feb. 16 article
in The Daily Californian.
The finding could impact
geological undertakings

as well as make it easier
to determine the weather
and. locate oil and miner-
als, the article states. The
new method is more pre-
cise and less costly than the
traditional use of satellite
technology, The Daily Cali-
fornian reported.
The scientists, called the
Budker Group, use the lasers
to send a powerful beam into
the mesosphere to detect
sodium atoms to determine
the frequency of their rota-
tion in the magnetic field
around the Earth, according
to the article.

Airlines cancel 230
flights in Detroit,
drivers advised to
stay off highways
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Hun-
dreds of flights were canceled at
Minneapolis-St. Paul Internation-
al Airport and officials in several
states advised people to stay off
the highways as a winter storm
blew through the upper Midwest
yesterday.
Even before the worst of the
storm hit, Delta Airlines canceled
about 700 flights to and from the
Twin Cities airport and other air-
lines thinned out their schedules,
said airport spokeswoman Melis-
sa Scovronski. She said yester-

day afternoon the storm had shut
down two of the airport's four
runways.
In Detroit, airlines canceled
roughly 230 flights though the
city's Metro Wayne County air-
port, while more than 200 flights
through Chicago's O'Hare airport
were off.
Traffic on the roads wasn't
much better. The National Weath-
er Service reported blizzard con-
ditions in western Minnesota and
issued a winter storm warning for
the rest of the southern half of the
state.
It was part of a storm that
stretched from Montana to Michi-
gan and was moving east. The
National Weather Service pre-
dicted it would bring a wintry mix
across the upper Midwest for sev-
eral days.

Weather service forecasters
predicted the storm would drop 10
to15 inches ofsnow on Minneapo-
lis by this afternoon, which prom-
ised to make for a tough commute
for those working on President's
Day.
"It's going to be snowing in the
morning," said weather service
meteorologist James McQuirter.
"It's going to be a messy com-
mute."
A spokesman for the Minnesota
Department of Transportation
recommended that people just
stay home and watch television on
yesterday afternoon, rather than
risk driving through the wind-
driven snow.
"If people don't need to travel,
they shouldn't," said spokesman
Kevin Gutknect. "It's really hard
for people to see."

Japan to dig site linked to World
War II human body experiments

Former nurse says
she and colleagues
buried body parts at
war site
TOKYO (AP) - Japan is exca-
vating the site of a former medi-
cal school that may reveal grisly
secrets from World War II.
The investigation begins this
afternoon at the former school
linked to Unit 731, a germ and
biological warfare outfit during
the war. Shadowy experiments
conducted by the unit on war pris-
oners have never been officially
acknowledged by the government
but have been documented by his-
torians and participants.
It is the first government probe
of the Tokyo site, and follows a
former nurse's revelation that she
helped bury body parts there as
American forces began occupying
the capital at the end of the war.

Health Ministry official
Kazuhiko Kawauchi said the
excavation is aimed at finding out
if anything is buried in the plot.
"We are not certain if the sur-
vey will find anything," Kawauchi
said. "If anything is dug up, it may
not be related to Unit 731."
The former nurse, Toyo Ishii,
now 88, broke 60 years of silence
in 2006, sayingshe and colleagues
at an army hospital at the site were
ordered to bury numerous corps-
es, bones and body parts during
the weeks following Japan's Aug.
15, 1945, surrender before Ameri-
can troops arrived in the capital.
Her disclosure led to a face-
to-face meeting with the health
minister and a government pledge
to investigate. The digging had to
waituntil the scheduled relocation
of residents and the demolition of
apartments on the site last year.
The site is close to another area
where a mass grave of dozens of
possible war-experiment victims
was uncovered in 1989 during the

construction of a Health Ministry
research institute.
Any remains found at the
planned excavation site would
have a stronger connection to
Unit 731, said Keiichi Tsuneishi,
a Kanagawa University history
professor and expert on biological
warfare.
"The site used to be the research
headquarters of Unit 731," Tsunei-
shi said. "If bones are found there,
they are most likely related to Unit
731."
From its wartime base in Japa-
nese-controlled Harbin in north-
ern China, Unit 731 and related
units injected war prisoners with
typhus, cholera and other diseases
to research germ warfare, accord-
ing to historians and former unit
members.
The 1989 find revealed dozens
of fragmented thigh bones and
skulls, some with holes drilled in
them or sections cut out. Police
denied there was any evidence of
criminal activity.

marching in Sanaa, the Yemeni
capital. Demonstrations were
also held in a number of districts

The protests pose the most
serious challenge to Saleh's rule
to date.

of concessions, pledging that

him and that he would not

Yesterday, he repeated his offer
for negotiations.

Saleh told a news conference. "I

they are legitimate," said the
Yemeni leader, who warned
against "infiltrators" seeking
to divide Yemenis and sabotage
their country.
A group of opposition parties
refused to engage in dialogue
while security forces continued
to suppress demonstrations.
"No dialogue with bullets,
clubs and thuggery," the group
said in a statement yesterday.
The protesters have been
inspired by uprisings in Egypt
and Tunisia.

Demonstrations
continue for
sixth day
CAIRO (AP) - After anti-gov-
ernment unrest spread to the Lib-
yan capital and protesters seized
military bases and weapons yes-
terday, Moammar Gadhafi's son
went on state television to pro-
claim that his father remained in
charge with the army's backing
and would "fight until the last
man, the last woman, the last bul-
let."
Seif al-Islam Gadhafi, in the
regime's first comments on the six
days of demonstrations, warned
the protesters that they risked
igniting a civil war in which Lib-
ya's oil wealth "willbe burned."
The speech followed a fierce
crackdown by security forces
who fired on thousands of dem-
onstrators and funeral marchers
in the eastern city of Benghazi
in a bloody cycle of violence that
killed 60 people yesterday alone,
according to a doctor in one city
hospital. Since the six days of
unrest began, more than 200 peo-
ple have been killed, according to
medical officials, human rights
groups and exiled dissidents.
Lybia's response has been the
harshest of any Arab country that
has been wracked by the protests
that toppled long-serving lead-
ers in neighboring Tunisia and
Egypt. But Gadhafi's son said his
father would prevail.

"We are not Tunisia and
Egypt," the younger Gadhafi said.
"Moammar Gadhafi, our leader, is
leading the battle in Tripoli, and
we are withhim."
"The armed forces are with
him. Tens of thousands are head-
ing here to be with him. We will
fight until the last man, the last
woman, the last bullet," he said
in a rambling and sometimes con-
fused speech of nearly 40 min-
utes.
The younger Gadhafi, who
is the regime's face of reform,
conceded that the army made
some mistakes during the pro-
tests because the troops were not
trained to deal with demonstra-
tors, but he added that the num-
ber of dead had been exaggerated,
giving a death toll of 84.
Western countries have
expressed concern at the rising
violence against demonstrators in
Libya. British Foreign Secretary
William Hague said he spoke to
Seif al-Islam Gadhafi by phone
and told him that the country
must embark on "dialogue and
implement reforms," the Foreign
Office said.
In the speech, the younger
Gadhafi offered to put forward
reforms within days that he
described as a "historic national
initiative" and said the regime
was willing to remove some
restrictions and begin discussions
for a constitution. He offered to
change a number of laws, includ-
ing those covering the media and
the penal code.

Democratic law
makers left state to
prevent quorum
MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Wis-
consin Republicans yesterday
upped the pressure on Demo-
crats who fled to Illinois to
return home and vote on an anti-
union bill, with the governor
calling them obstructionists and
a GOP lawmaker threatening to
convene without them.
Gov. Scott Walker said the 14
minority Democrats who left
Madison on Thursday were fail-
ing to do their jobs by "hiding
out" in another state. And Senate
Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald
said his chamber would meet
Tuesday to act on non-spending
bills and confirm some of the
governor's appointees even if
the Democrats don't show up -
a scenario .that ..shuldoutrage,
their constituents.
Senate Democrats acknowl-
edged that the 19 Republicans
could pass any item that doesn't
spend state money in their
absence. The budget-repair bill
they have been blocking requires
a quorum of 20 senators to pass,
while other measures require
only a simple majority of the
chamber's 33 members.
Nonetheless, Democrats said

they were standing firm in their
opposition to the budget-repair
bill, which would take away the
right of most public employees
to collectively bargain for their
benefits and working conditions.
Hundreds of protesters filled the
Capitol for a sixth straight day,
noisily calling on Walker to drop
the plan they consider an assault
on workers' rights.
Mary Bell, the president of
Wisconsin's powerful teach-
ers' union, called on teachers to
returnto work as scheduled today
rather than continue absences to
protest that have shut down pub-
lic schools across the state. The
Madison district said it would
still cancel today's classes.
Bell said unions agreed to cuts
in health care and retirement
benefits that could reduce take-
home pay for many workers by
about 8 percent, and it was time
for the Republican governor to
compromise.
In an interview from Madi-
son with Fox News yesterday
morning, Walker said he did not
believe union leaders were really
interested in giving up their ben-
efits and cities, school districts
and counties will need weakened
unions to cut spending for years
tocome. Walkersaidhewouldnot
compromise and predicted Wis-
consin would pave the way for
other states to follow suit, much

like it did with welfare reform
and school vouchers in thet1990s.
"We're willing to take this as
long as it takes because in the
end we're doing the right thing,"
Walker said.
The sweeping measure led
to massive protests that started
Tuesday and have gained steam,
with an estimated 68,000 peo-
ple turning out Saturday inside
and around the Capitol. Most
opposed the bill, but the day
marked the first time that a sig-
nificant contingent of Walker
supporters showed up to coun-
ter-protest.
Yesterday's crowd was much
smaller, as snow and freezing
rain moved the protest inside the
Capitol. But the crowd swelled
throughout the day, and protest-
ers chanted for hours in opposi-
tion to the bill. Another large
protest was expected Monday,
when many state workers are
beingfurloughed.to save money..
Mariah Clark, an emergency,
medical technician at Univer-
sity of Wisconsin hospital and
a volunteer firefighter, said she
stands to lose $250 per month
from her income with the ben-
efits concessions. Standing on
a bench holding a sign reading
"EMT. Firefighter. Not the pub-
lic enemy," she said the pay cut
would hurt but that's not why
she was protesting.

Bahraini protesters ask
to talk with gov't leaders

Seven killed since
protests began
last week
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP)
- Bahrain's opposition wants
the nation's rulers to guaran-
tee they will back up their con-
ciliatory words with actions, a
Shiite leader said yesterday as
he and other activists weighed
the regime's offer for talks after
nearly a week of protests and
deadly clashes that have divided
the Gulf nation.
The streets in the tiny but
strategically important island
kingdom were calmer as efforts
shifted toward political hag-
gling over demands the mon-
archy give up its near-absolute
control over key policies and
positions.
But bitterness and tensions
still run deep after seesaw battles.

that saw riot police opening fire
on protesters trying to reclaim
landmark Pearl Square and then
pulling back to allow them to
occupy it. At least seven people
-aveheen killed and.hundreds
injured since the Arab wave for
change reached the Gulf last
Monday. The protesters were
preparing to spend another night
in the square by late Sunday.
Bahrain holds particular
importance to Washington as
the host of the U.S. Navy's Fifth
Fleet, which is the main U.S.
military counterweight to Iran's
efforts to expand its armed forc-
es and reach into the Gulf. Bah-
rain's ruling Sunni dynasty has
strong backing from other Gulf
Arab leaders, who fear that Shi-
ite powerhouse Iran could gain
further footholds through the
uprising led by Bahrain's Shiite
majority. The Shiite majority has
often complains of discrimina-
tion by the Sunni rulers.

Texas proposes bill allowing guns
to be carried on college campuses

Similar bills have
been introduced in
about a dozen
other states
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Texas
is preparing to give college stu-
dents and professors the right to
carry guns on campus, adding
momentum to a national cam-
paign to openthis partofsociety
to firearms.
More than half the members
of the Texas House have signed
on as co-authors of a measure
directing universities to allow
concealed handguns. The Sen-
ate passed a similar bill in 2009
and is expected to do so again.
Republican Gov. Rick Perry,
who sometimes packs a pistol
when he jogs, has said he's in
favor of the idea.
Texas has become a prime
battleground for the issue
because of its gun culture and
its size, with 38 public univer-
sities and more than 500,000
students. It would become the
second state, following Utah,
to pass such a broad-based law.
Colorado gives colleges the
option and several have allowed
handguns.
Supporters of the legisla-
tion argue that gun* violence
on campuses, such as the mass
shootings at Virginia Tech in
2007 and Northern Illinois in
2008, show that the best defense
against a gunman is students
who can shoot back.
"It's strictly a matter of self-
defense," said state Sen. Jeff
Wentworth, R-San Antonio. "I

don't ever want to see repeated
on a Texas college campus what
happened at Virginia Tech,
where some deranged, suicidal
madman goes into a building
and is able to pick off totally
defenseless kids like sitting
ducks."
Until the Virginia Tech inci-
dent, the worst college shoot-
ing in U.S. history occurred at
the University of Texas, when
sniper Charles Whitman went
to the top of the administra-
tion tower in 1966 and killed 16
people and wounded dozens.
Last September, a University of
Texas student fired several shots
from an assault rifle before kill-
ing himself.
Similar firearms measures
have been proposed in about a
dozen other states, but all face
strong opposition, especially
from college leaders. In Okla-
homa, all 25 public college and
university presidents declared
their opposition to a concealed
carry proposal.
"There is no scenario where
allowing concealed weapons on
college campuses will do any-
thing other than create a more
dangerous environment for stu-
dents, faculty, staff and visitors,"
Oklahoma Chancellor of Higher
Education Glen Johnson said in
January.
University of Texas President
William Powers has opposed
concealed handguns on campus,
saying the mix of students, guns
and campus parties is too vola-
tile.
Guns occupy a special place in
Texas culture. Politicians often
tout owning a gun as essential to
being Texan. Concealed hand-

gun license holders are allowed
to skip the metal detectors that
scan Capitol visitors for guns,
knives and other contraband.
Guns on campus bills have
been rejected in 23 states since
2007, but gun control activists
acknowledge it will be diffi-
cult to stop the Texas bill from
passing this year. "Things do
look bleak," said Colin Goddard,
assistant director of federal leg-
islation for the Brady Campaign
Against Gun Violence, who
was in Austin recently to lobby
against the Texas bills.
Goddard was a student at
Virginia Tech when he was shot
four times in his French class.
Student Seung-Hui Cho killed
32 people, including 10 in God-
dard's classroom, before shoot-
ing himself. Goddard dismisses
the idea that another student
with a gun could have stopped
the killer.
"People tell me that if they
would have been there, they
would have shot that guy. That
offends me," Goddard said.
"People want to be the hero,
I understand that. They play
video games and they think they
understand the reality. It's noth-
ing like that."
But Derek Titus, a senior at
Texas A&M who has a state
license to carry a concealed
handgun, said someone with
a gun that day could have
improved the chances of sur-
vival.
"Gun-free zones are shooting
galleries for the mass murder-
ers," Titus said. "We do not feel
that we must rely on the police
or security forces to defend our
lives."

FROM THE DAILY
Working out the kinks
University gym renovations are long overdue
Student-athletes at the University have access to some of the fin-
est athletic facilities a college can offer. Far from the same can
be said for the rest of the student body. The conditions of the
Central Campus Recreational Building, North Campus Recreational
Building and Intramural Sports Building are each far below the qual-
ity that students deserve.

From the lack of new equipment, to the
decrepit locker and shower rooms, the Univer-
sity's recreational facilities have long needed
a facelift. The University's recent decision to
allocate $1.6 million to upgrade the school's
recreational facilities is a step in the right
direction. But the University has waited too
long to address the state of recreational facili-
ties that are widely used by students, and it
must ensure that these facilities are improved
to alevel that is acceptable to the studentbody.
According to an article in the Daily today
("Recreationfacilities get1.6M renovation") the
$1.6 million will cover the cost of60 new cardio
machines, the addition of televisions in cardio
areas, refurbished lobbies and renovated lock-
ers and shower rooms for the school's recre-
ational facilities. Studies are currently being
conducted to determine future renovations
to the facilities, such as the expansion of gym
space and the installation of wireless Inter-
net and food areas. The Department of Rec-
reational Sports explained that the upgrades
have taken a long time to be proposed because
recreational facilities have little value for the
school in recruiting and retainingstudents.
While the planned renovations are a prom-
ising start, the University should make sure
future renovations cover the gamut of what
needs improvement in recreational facilities
on campus. More new cardio machines are a

necessity. As a campus of nearly 40,000 stu-
dents, 60 new cardio machineswill only slight-
ly solve the problem of overcrowding. And the
shortage isn't limited to cardio machines. A
variety of new equipment is also needed, from
new weights and weight machines, to new
rental equipment like basketballs and squash
rackets.
More spacious cardio and weightlifting
areas are also needed, as students should have
the opportunity to work out in an open setting
- not the current congested exercise rooms.
Many facility surfaces, like the basketball and
racquetball courts, have been worn down and
are in need of serious refurbishing. The avail-
ability of wireless Internet and food options
would also make the recreational facilities
more functional places for students.
The University's explanation as to why
these renovations have been their last priority
shows a serious disregard for student needs.
The conditions of the University's recreational
facilities are about the quality of life for stu-
dents, not whether or not the recreational
facilities draw students to come to the school.
The University's negligence can easily be cor-
rected by appropriately handling the planned
$1.6 million renovations and future improve-
ments. The facilities and equipment available
at the CCRB, NCRB and IM Building need to
reflect the desires of the student body.

eff Daniels thought he was all
set. After all, he had spoken
to the man
and made a deal.
What could go
wrong?
According to
a Feb. 17 Detroit 0
Free Press arti-
cle (Jeff Daniels:
Snyder said one
thing, did anoth- IMRAN
er, 02/17/11), SYED
Daniels said that
then-candidate
and now Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder told him during the 2010
campaign that, if he was elected
governor, he would not eliminate
Michigan's film incentives.
Daniels - a prominent Michigan-
der and actor who is perhaps still
best known for his role opposite
Jim Carrey in "Dumb and Dumber"
- thought that personal assurance
from Snyder would be good enough.
Regardless of what Snyder was say-
ing in public, Daniels thought he
knew the real truth. He had a gen-
tleman's agreement, and he expect-
ed it would be abided.
So, when Snyder announced
plans last week to effectively elimi-
nate the state's film incentives, Dan-
iels was incensed. He told the Free
Press: "It's not what he told me pri-
vately, so to be honest, I guess he's
a politician after all. Say one thing,
do another."
Now, Snyder denies ever telling
Daniels anything, and whether or
not the film incentives are a good
investment is a worthy debate, but
one we will not have just now. What
I'd like to focus on instead is Dan-
iels's statement and mindset, and
for that purpose, we will assume
that Snyder did in fact tell him that
he would keep the film incentives.
If that is the case, then Daniels
expected that Snyder would honor

that private agreement with him,
regardless ofthe dutyheowedtothe
voters at large. For example, Snyder
mentioned on several occasions
on the campaign trail that the film
tax credits cost more than they're
worth and should be reevaluated
and perhaps eliminated. Millions
of Michiganders heard him express
those thoughts, and surely they
expected him to follow through on
what he said after they elected him
by a considerable majority.
But Daniels expected Snyder to
ignore all that and follow through
on their secret agreement. And
because Snyder didn't do that,
Daniels disparagingly called him a
calculating politician. Interesting,
right?
This isn't a rebuke of Daniels,
but rather a sad commentary on
how the minds of most voters work.
We all hate special interests; the
thought of some rich and powerful
guy getting to whisper orders into
our leaders' ears enflames the core
of every American. As ideas go, spe-
cial access and private agreements
among politicians are the most un-
American things of all.
Daniels knows all this. But, like
all of us, he is conveniently blinded
when his own issues are involved,
and the secret agreement is his own.
Much like Republican senators who
hate the filibuster, the judicial nom-
inating process and special rules of
legislative procedure when they're
in the minority - but love it all
in the majority - Daniels is in the
unenviable position here of living a
double standard.
Snyder is no hero in all this: I
would argue that he is failing to
live up to his campaign promise
to return innovation and jobs to
Michigan by short-sightedly elimi-
nating the one fledgling industry
that could-quickly return business,
tourism and enthusiasm to this

state. There's plenty to criticize in
his budget plan, but his failure to
honor an alleged secret agreement,
if one was ever made, must be above
rebuke.
Daniels meanswell, and I happen
to agree with him on the film cred-
its, but he has no right to expect pri-
vate service from a public servant.
Be it the evil tobacco lobby or some-
thing much more lovable, all spe-
cial interests serve to short-circuit
a democracy. Part of reforming our
political system away from a glacial
bureaucracy thatonly some insiders
can shape is coming to a realization
that there can be no exceptions.
Daniels expected
Snyder to protect
film incentives.
The core of this argument is that,
regardless of what we believe about
specific issues, we must first ensure
the integrity of the governmental
systems that we use to bring about
our preferred brand of change. It
may be perfectly well to support
issues like welfare reform, gun
rights or easier access to abortions,
but we must all understand that
an "at all costs/this very instant"
approach cannot work. We cannot
dismantle the very systems that
support our governmental order to
affect change. To do so would be to
kill the golden goose.
In the end, it all returns to civil-
ity, patience and compromise. Yes,
that's the hard way to do things, but
who ever said the American way
was the easy way?

Bringing GSRAs into GEO
isn't the best solution
TO THE DAILY:
Recently I have heard a bit of rhetoric and
speculation involving the push by the Gradu-
ate Employees' Organization to incorporate the
wages andbenefits ofgraduatestudentresearch
assistantsintotheir collective bargainingagree-
ment. However, as far as hard facts are con-
cerned, there is quite a bit left to be desired. The
following is the opinion of a lowly engineer.
Here is what I know on the issue. GEO
doesn't represent me to the University, not
even implicitly. The University desires to be
a top-level research institution. As such, it
employs my fellow graduate students and I as
GSRAs. Yes, research is a primary mission of
the University. Market forces dictate that if
the University wants the best students then
it needs to give good pay and benefits. The
wage paid to graduate student instructors
is one of a number of benchmarks that the
University uses to determine a good GSRA
wage. Many departments use different stan-
dards. Furthermore, all students employed as
GSRAs with whom I have talked to state that
they have excellent working conditions, pay
and benefits. Also, their work as a GSRA has
become, or is intended to become, their thesis
Hoke's comment at Mock
Rock wasn't appropriate

work. Obviously, I cannot claim to speak for
the students with whom I have not spoken. So,
this is not a universal statement, just the pat-
tern that I have noticed.
Beyond what I know, I have heard a lot
of things both in favor and in disapproval of
unionization. I have heard thatGEO is the only
guaranteed means for students to petition the
University for the redress of grievances. I have
also heard that students already have many
options. I have heard secondhand stories about
bosses forcing students to work unreasonable
hours with no means of recourse. I have yet to
hear confirmation of a single one ofthese stories.
I have also, not even remotely, heard how the
unionization of GSRAs would work to increase
the pay or benefits of the students involved.
That being said, after filtering through all
of the rhetoric and claims that are bouncing
around, I cannot find a good reason why stu-
dents should pay several hundred dollars in
dues a year with no definite benefit. If someone
could come forward with confirmable stories
of unreasonable working conditions for stu-
dents - where joining GEO would be the most
reasonable recourse, or a good breakdown of
wage and benefit disparity; where joining GEO
would serve to correct this - then I might con-
sider changing my view.

This fall, the Michigan Student Assembly launched
the "Get Involved Campaign" to encourage students
to join different organizations on campus. Campaign
events like Pre-Class Bash and Service Diag Day aim to
promote freshmen involvement outside the classroom.
While this programming was extremely effective in
informing students about the diversity of opportunities
on campus, the process of determining interests and pas-
sions begins prior to a student's arrival in the fall. Once
on campus, students often feel smothered by invitations
to attend mass meetings or overwhelmed by their adjust-
ment to college life. Even events like Festifall, which
aim to expose students to the abundance of groups and
activities on campus, can be cumbersome and difficult
to navigate.
Each year, a new pool of motivated and hardworking
men and women attend New Student Orientation in order
to become better prepared for life at the University. This
program is very successful in informing students about
most of the challenges they will face and the experiences
they will have once on campus in September. However~
campus involvement is understandably marginalized
during this program to make room for necessary infor-
mation regarding academics, campus safety, etc. Office
of Student Activities and Leadership staff members are
only allotted a short, 10 minutes to discuss the resources
they provide for students in finding the right niche out-
side the classroom.
This is unfortunate because the work done outside of
a student's academic program can offer as much value as
the work done within it and can account for a student's
most memorable experiences at college. If incoming stu-
dents heard about the importance of joining a student
organization duringtheir orientation session,ctheywould
find it easier to navigate the wealth of student organiza-
tions prior to their campus arrival in September.
MSA is seeking to remedy this problem by crafting a
program that grants a platform to current student lead-
ers in the form of a panel discussion during new student
orientation. A forum led by current students, rather than
staff, and one which allows for incoming students to
engage with current ones about their extra-curricular

involvement, would send a powerful message to fresh-
man that community involvement is a crucial part of
the University experience. By introducing freshman to
current student leaders, who can explain why and how
to get involved, students can begin thinking about how
they want to make their mark on campus. The program
could even provide students the opportunity to look
through Maize Pages, discover options that they didn't
even know existed, get the contact information for
that organization's leader and quickly reach out to that
group. Student organizations benefit from this as well,
since many groups begin their work prior to the start of
the school year, and would welcome the opportunity to
include freshmen in the planning process.
One goal of this program is to present incoming
freshman with student leaders from a diverse group of
campus communities and organizations. While these
panelists won't aim to recruit students to their specific
organizations, having representation from service orga-
nizations, cultural and advocacy groups, Greek Life and
student government will provide freshmen with numer-
ous perspectives that can inspire them to find their own
passions.
New Student Orientation, which is run by the Office of
New Student Programs, would benefit from the program
because freshmen are not otherwise exposed to current
college students during orientation, except orientation
leaders. This exposure helps accomplish the goal of stu-
dent orientation.The opportunitytospeak, notonlywith
students but with those who lead our campus, would be
a great catalyst in instilling energy and enthusiasm in
incoming freshmen, as well as calm the nerves of those
unsure of what lies ahead.
In the coming weeks, members of MSA will be meet-
ing with ONSP to present their plan in the hopes of
implementing a pilot program for this summer's orien-
tation sessions. While those most invested in the initia-
tive believe that their model for the event is strong, they
are fully committed to accommodating the needs and
desires of ONSP in order to make these efforts a reality.

TENURE
From Page lA
on the tenure track to balance
research, teaching and family
responsibilities.
Though all faculty members are
affected by the changing nature of
research, Hanlon wrote that clini-
cal faculty in the Medical School
are recommending a change to the

policy.
"In those departments (in the
MedicalSchool),these factors cre-
ate stress that has been recounted
to me by numerous faculty, as well
as the academic leadership of the
School," Hanlon wrote. "The time
pressures in the Medical School
are further evidenced by the
requeststhat come to me for facul-
ty to switch from the tenure track
to the clinical track."

At the regents' monthly meet-
ing last Thursday, five Medical
School faculty members spoke in
favor of the proposal. Each indi-
vidual cited various health crises
and research setbacks to illustrate
the need for an extended tenure
probationary period.
While the clinical faculty in
the Medical School support the
proposal, members of the Senate
Assembly - the faculty's govern-

ing body - have publicly voiced
their oppositionto the measure.
At its January meeting, Senate
Assembly passed two resolutions
stating its disapproval of the ten-
ure proposal.
One resolution reaffirmed sup-
port for a 2006 Senate Assembly
resolution that expressed concern
with any changes that would be
made to Regents' Bylaw 5.09. The
other resolution stated that only

tenured or tenure-track faculty
should be able to make decisions
regarding tenure, not the faculty
as a whole.
"Only tenure-track faculty
should be eligible to make final
decisions (regarding tenure),"
Ed Rothman, chair of the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs, said at the meeting.
"And the reason for this is because,
in the Medical School in particu-

lar, we tenured and tenure-track
faculty are a minority."
The University Senate was
scheduled to meet today to dis-
cuss the proposed change to the
tenure process, but that meeting
has been postponed until March
21. Instead, SACUA will meet
this afternoon and will discuss
the tenure probationary period,
according to the assembly's week-
ly agenda.

man said in an opening address
that the University is committed
to encouraging students to cre-
ate original ideas.
"The University of Michigan
actively supports entrepreneurs
who are committing themselves
to making an impact, whether
economically, socially or envi-
ronmentally," Coleman said.
"We can all be proud of the teams
that competed in this statewide

event because it is a powerful
statement about our collective
future."
Gerard Anderson, president
and CEO of DTE Energy, intro-
duced Snyder and said the Clean
Energy Prize competition pro-
motes a more positive future for
Michigan.
"We founded this competition
because, like Governor Snyder, we
believe that this state's best days
are yet to come," Anderson said.
Prior to assuming his first
public office position in January,
Snyder was a public accountant
and venture capitalist in Ann
Arbor. He said in his speech that
his experiences in technological
entrepreneurship taught him the
importance of understanding the
challenges of starting a new busi-
ness.
Itis criticalthat budding entre-
preneurs have passion for the
projects they take on, Snyder

said. Prospective entrepreneurs
should have patience, he said,
because a normal venture takes
an average of seven years to
go from an idea to a successful'
product.
"That's a significant commit-
ment," Snyder said. "But I can
tell you personally ... it's a com-
mitment that's worth it."
Snyder said when he became
involved with venture capital-
ism in 1998, many Michigan
business leaders weren't aware
of what the business entailed.
He said the difficulty of obtain-
ing licenses was a particularly
cumbersome obstacle for entre-
preneurs.
"We've come so far," Snyder
said. "and the best part is we're
going to continue to grow and get
better and better."
He added that he is proud the
University has developed strong
relationships with technology

companies and cited the Univer-
sity as one of the top five institu-
tions in the country involved with
technology transfer.
Snyder also said organiza-
tions like Ann Arbor SPARK- a
locally based business incubator-
encourage entrepreneurs to use
their ideas to create startup busi-
nesses.
Snyder said though morale
about the state's economy might
be low, Michigan is a leader in
innovation and has much poten-
tial.
"We're up there with the
top," he said. "We don't actually
recognize that yet, so I remind
you, hold your head with pride if
you're an entrepreneur or inno-
vator in our state today."
Addressing the finalists of
the competition, Snyder said it
is important to look forward to
forthcoming opportunities.
"This is about doing new

things; this is about building in
the future," he said. "If you don't
win today, don't lose that fire.
Don't lose that passion. Learn
some lessons. Learn what you
can do better."
In an interview following the
event, Coleman said she was
happy to see that the competi-
tion gave students the tools and
opportunity to further their
innovative ideas.
"I am always impressed with
the sophisticated, high-level
work that students can do, and
we need to keep tapping into that
energy because that's going to be
our future for the country and
for the state," Coleman said.
She added that Synder's pres-
ence at the event shows the
importance of clean energy
entrepreneurship.
"I think it really says how
much everyone is embracing
these ideas," Coleman said.

Rackham student Nick Moroz,
team leader of CSquared Innova-
tions, said in an interview after
the event that the awards cer-
emony was uplifting.
"It's really easy to see that
there are a lot of great innova-
tions in the state that are going to
help manufacturing really bring
back a great economic turn for
the state," Moroz said.
Other finalists included West-
ern Michigan University-based
Perennial BioEnergy LLC, and
Impact Card and Smart Energy
Loan Fund, two other startups
from the University.
He added that the competi-
tion shows Michigan students'
desire to develop ideas that have
a broad impact.
"... it really shows that they're
not driven just to their stud-
ies, but they're driven to make
an impact in the world around
them," Moroz said.


COLLEGE
From Page 1A
Michigan College Advising Corps,
a program that places University
graduates in underrepresented
Michigan schools to serve as col-
lege advisers, were chosen for the
Wolverine Express program.
William Collins, executive
director of the Center for Educa-
tional Outreach and a member of
the Diversity Council said he felt
the new initiative would comple-
ment the advising program well.
"We married the Wolverine
Express to our Advising Corps
Program," he said. "It meant a
great deal of work in a relatively
short period of time."
The creators came up with

the idea last summer and devel-
oped the initial stages through-
out the fall, working with high
school principals and counselors
to determine the best ways to
assist students. Collins said when
they were ready to begin, all eight
schools in the advising program
also wanted to be involved with
Wolverine Express.
Because many of the students
in the schools would be first-gen-
eration college students, they may
not know what is necessary to do
to get started in certain job fields,
Collins said.
"The background information
of what one needs to do to pursue
a particular career is often miss-
ing for many of these students,"
he said.
For example, students don't

necessarily make the connec-
tion that becoming an engineer
requires extensive knowledge
of applied mathematics, or that
medicine involves advanced sci-
ence and chemistry skills, Collins
said.
"One of the things that hap-
pens when faculty members go
into these schools is students have
the opportunity to interact with
them directly," Collins said. "It
allows them to identify with what
that person is doing."
The purpose of Wolverine
Express isn't to recruit for the
University, Collins said, but rather
to encourage students to pursue
higher education. This message
is important, he said, because the
United States has shifted focus
from primarily manufacturing

jobs to service jobs, particularly
in the state of Michigan.
"The jobs that are available to
young people today increasingly
are jobs that require post-second-
ary education," Collins said.
Noori, who is also a lecturer of
American Culture and English,
emphasized the significance of a
college degree when she spoke to
Saginaw High School Students.
She told the students that their
education is extremely valuable
and can't be taken away by oth-
ers despite difficult economic cir-
cumstances.
University alum Ryan McBride,
who is serving as a college adviser
at Saginaw High School through
the Michigan College Advis-
ing Corps, said he estimates that
more than half the high school's

student body participated in
Wolverine Express. He said the
programwas beneficial tothe stu-
dents because they had a chance
to meet professors and learn from
their research and knowledge.
"It gave them a really good
glimpse into what college is like,"
McBride said. "It exposed them to
people who work in higher educa-
tion."
He said the program inspired
the students and "gave them the
confidence that they could pursue
higher education."
She added that it is important
for schools like the University to
focus on reaching out to these stu-
dents.
"I think it's easy for schools like
ours to become potentially elitist
and selective in ways that aren't

necessarily the most healthy
...(Diversity) makes for a stronger
structure," Noori said.
While visiting Saginaw High
School, Crisca Bierwert, chair of
the University's Diversity Coun-
cil, set out to inspire the students
by giving a brief lesson on the
Treaty of 1817, explaining how
the state of Michigan bought the
land on which the University was
built, and at its inception, the
University only had 11 students
enrolled.
"I told them that this is a story
of small beginnings and big
accomplishments, and I hoped it
would inspire them to go to col-
lege," Bierwert said. "I told them
that I thought they could all make
history, and that they would all
make history."


RENOVATION
From Page 1A
ther areas for improvement and
longer-term projects apart from
those that will use the $1.6 million
for Recreational Sports facilities,
according to William Canning,
director of Recreational Sports at
the University.
All the renovations, including
those that will potentially be done
as a result of the upcoming study,
will take approximately five to 10
years, according to Canning. The
funding will potentially extend
gym hours and increase programs
and the number of staff members.
By replacing old equipment,
Canning said the University will
save money in the long term since
upkeep of broken-down machines
amasses substantial fees.
"The older equipment was
costing us so much time, labor
and money for the replacement
parts of some of the old treadmills
that we've already seen some sig-
nificant savings in our expense
budget because we have new
equipment that are now under
warranty," Canning said.
Equipment replacements and
locker room overhauls are already
underway, and the department is
currently in the process of install-
ing cable television in some cardio
rooms at each gym, he said. The
renovation funding will also be
used to install AstroTurf on Elbel
Field. The funding has already
been used to replace the roof and
upkeep of the University's ropes
challenge course located on Dix-
boro Road, according to Canning.
To garner student input on
the renovations, the Department
of Recreational Sports held stu-
dent focus groups last year and
throughout the summer, Canning
said.

Fitzgerald said Magee would

groups, said that as a member
of the club softball team she is
forced to play at Ann Arbor city
parks rather than on University
property because there is no reg-
ulation field. Since her team trav-
els to other universities, she said
she was able to compare their
facilities to those of the Univer-
sity and gauge how they can be
improved.
Kraft said she felt the Univer-
sity took student feedback into
consideration when developing
the final renovation plans. She
said while the project may not be
exactly what she would hope for,
the University strived to incorpo-
rate the student perspective.
"Because of the size of the stu-
dent body, it's hard to capture
our voice," Kraft said. "It's hard
to know what the students want
because we're here for a couple
years, and we're gone, and a proj-
ect like this is going to take a lot
of time."
The study that Harper com-
missioned will call for continued
expansion of space at the gyms to
more efficiently accommodate the
growing student body, according
to Canning.
The University's student body
was the largest ever during the
fall2010 semester with 41,924 stu-
dents enrolled at the Ann Arbor
campus. There were 3.1 percent
more undergraduates than the
previous year - due partly to a
bigger freshman class than origi-
nally estimated - and 6.7 percent
more graduate and professional
students.
According to Canning, the
study calls for almost a doubling
of square footage and an increase
from three to 12 general recre-
ation rooms like those used for
U-Move classes.
Canning said one reason Rec-

vations may not have been a top
priority for funding allocation in
past years is that gyms are often
used as draws for recruiting stu-
dents and increasing retention
rates at universities - problems
the University doesn't struggle
with. However, Canning said ini-
tiatives like renovating the gyms
and residence halls are more of a
"quality of life" issue at the Uni-
versity rather than incentives to
bring in more tuition money.
"My job is to make sure ... that
it's a good experience when you
come in the facilities," Canning
said. "It will be a bright, better
experience for students to come in
and get healthy."
Building closures will depend
on the magnitude of renova-
tions, Canning said, but there will
always be a gym open on campus.
LSA sophomore Ida Ahmadi-
zadeh said she regularly goes to
the gym but still views the Uni-
versity's facilities as "abysmal,"
especially in comparison to those
at other schools.
"Other schools are so much

nicer, they actually have televi-
sions and machines from this cen-
tury ... and they're cleaner," she
said.
LSA freshman Dylan Margalit
said the gyms are often crowded
and that while he enjoys using the
IM building, he dislikes the over-
all layout of the CCRB.
"There are all these different
rooms and each one's a little box,
and you don't have much space,"
he said. "It gets a little claustro-
phobic."
LSA freshman Kendal Noonan
said though she doesn't use the
gyms often, she thinks they're
sufficient. She said she doesn't
foresee the renovations leading to
an influx in use amongstudents.
"I don't really think it will
make that much of a difference
to students," Noonan said. "Obvi-
ously if it's nicer it's going to be
more pleasant when you're there,
but I don't necessarily think that
means that you'll go more. If it's
not in your routine to go to the
gym, you're not going to go to the
gymjust because it's nicer."


remain on paid leave until the
executive director position is
filled. He added that he isn't sure
what will happen to Magee's
title or paid leave after Magee is
replaced.
"I don't know how it will play
out," Fitzgerald said.
The job posting is slated to
expire on April 18. Qualifications
listed for the position include
eight years of safety experience

and a degree in criminal justice,
among other criteria.
Fitzgerald said he doesn't know
how Magee's replacement will be
decided.
Originally from Ann Arbor
and a University alum, Magee
was named executive director
of DPS in November 2008. After
an extensive screening process,
he was selected from 250 candi-
dates from numerous universi-

ties.
At the time of his appointment,
Magee said he was happy to be
back in his hometown.
"I plan on being here a long
time; this is not a stepping stone
for me," Magee said in January
2009.

and restricted Internet searches

Though there are many simi-

voiced by Middle East citizens
and the everyday troubles of Chi-

country's media, Internet and
other communication forums
poses difficulties for anyone try-
ing to organize mass demonstra-
tions.
Police stepped up their pres-
ence near major public squares
and canceled holidays for officers
across 20 cities in response to the
protest appeal, the Hong Kong-
based Information Center for

Human Rights and Democracy
reported.
Extensive Internet filtering and
monitoring meant that most Chi-
nese were unlikely to know about
the call to protest Sunday. Boxun.
com is blocked, as are Twitter and
Facebook, which were instru-
mental in Egypt's protest move-
ment. Tech-savvy Chinese can
circumvent controls, but few of
the country's Internet users seek
out politically subversive content.
Anti-government gatherings
in China are routinely stamped
out by its pervasive security forc-
es, which are well-funded and
well-equipped. A pro-democracy
movement in 1989 that directly
challenged the Communist gov-
ernment was crushed by the
military and hundreds, perhaps
thousands, were killed.
On Saturday, President Hu Jin-
tao ordered national and provin-
cial officials to "solve prominent
problems which might harm the

harmony and stability of the soci-
ety."
One person sitting in the
McDonald's after the brief protest
in Beijing said he saw Sunday's
gathering as a dry run.
"Lots of people in here are
Twitter users and came to watch
like me," said 42-year-old Hu Di.
"Actually this didn't have much
organization, but it's a chance to
meet each other. It's like prepar-
ing for the future."
With foot traffic always heavy
at the Wangfujing pedestrian
mall, it was difficult to discern
who showed up to protest, who
came to watch and who was out
shopping. Many wondered if
there was a celebrity in the area
because of the heavy police pres-
ence and dozens of foreign report-
ers and news cameras.
As the crowd swelled and police
urged people to move on, 25-year-
old Liu Xiaobai placed a white jas-
mine flower on a planter in front

of the McDonald's and took some
photos with his cell phone.
"I'm quite scared because they
took away my phone. I just put
down some white flowers, what's
wrong with that?" Liu said after-
ward. "I'm just a normal citizen
and I just want peace."
Security agents tried to.take
away Liu, but he was swarmed
by journalists and eventually was
seen walking away with a friend.
Two other people were taken
awaybypolice,includingashabbi-
ly dressed old man who was curs-
ing and shouting, though it wasn't
clear if he was there because of
the online call to protest.
In Shanghai, three young men
were taken away from outside a
Starbucks coffee shop in People's
Square by police, who refused to
answer reporters' questions about
why they were detained. They
trio had been shouting complaints
about the government and that
food prices are too high.

... I'm
studying anthropological
archaeology."
"What? What is that? How
is that different from archaeol-

"Well, Michigan has two
archaeology departments - clas-
sical archaeology and anthro-
pological archaeology - and
classical archeology focuses on
Greece, Rome, Egypt and the
Middle East, while anthropo-
logical archaeology focuses on
everything else. I don't really
want to study just 'classical'
stuff, so I decided archaeology
under the anthropology umbrella
was abetter fit."
"Huh. So, how in the world
did you become interested in
that? That's so bizarre/interest-

stick out squarely in my memory:
Dr. Paul Sereno, a paleontologist,
Dr. Bob Ballard, an oceanogra-

Appeal 'Unknown'

Surprisingly, January
Jones is one of the
few pros of new film
By WILL DEFEBAUGH
DailyArts Writer
Unknown are the reasons why
anyone would want to see the
2011 film starring Liam Neeson
("Taken") and
January Jones
(TV's "Mad
Men") of the Unkno
same title.
Correction: At Quality16
Unknown are and Rave
the reasons
why anyone
should see the
film. After all, its draw is under-
standable. Captivating, cryptic
trailers that, arguably, give away
too much of the plot. Car chases.
Explosions. January Jones. The
promise of a new and improved
"Bourne Identity." The allure is
definitely there. Unfortunately,
that's all this film has going for it.
When Dr. Martin Harris (Nee-
son) awakes from a car accident-
induced coma four days after
arriving in Berlin for a medi-
cal conference, no one believes
that he is who he says he is. This

includes the police, doctors,
hotel clerks, fellow conference-
goers and even his wife Eliza-
beth (Jones). Too bad for Martin
that he left his briefcase, which
contains his identification, at the
airport and doesn't remember
doing it. The plot thickens when
he reaches the conference to dis-
coverthere is alreadya Dr. Martin
Harris there, standing with his
arm around his wife.
Possibly the most chilling
moment of the film comes when
Martin taps his wife on the shoul-
der. She turns around in a gor-
geous, backless velvetgown, looks
at him blankly and then asks: "Do
I know you?" The haunting fac-
tor of this scene, of course, comes
from Jones. With her icy blue
eyes, perfect platinum hair, por-
celain skin and hollow stare, she
keeps the mystery alive. From
the beginning, it's difficult to
say whether she is an innocent
bystanderinthetraumaunfolding
before her husband or an accom-
plice in his undoing. She isthe real
star of the film, which would have
been far better off including more
of her.
Every other aspect "Unknown"
is, in a word, boring. Dr. Harris.
quickly discovers that it is not
all in his head, becomes desper-
ate to prove his identity, meets a

convenient old man who "finds
people" and teams up with the
poor girl with the bad German
accent (Diane Kruger, "Inglorious
Basterds") who was driving the
taxi when he crashed. Yawn.
These plot points, while not
necessarily predictable, are
just not exciting enough. With
each plot development the story
becomes more tiresome and less
believable. Even the bigplot twist
that is meant to make audiences'
jaws drop doesn't. It's not that
the audience isn't surprised when
it happens. They just don't care
anymore. By the time the race to
stop the ticking bomb begins, they
have lost interest entirely.
The film's sole redeem-
ing quality, besides Jones, is its
direction. Director Jaume Collet-
Serra ("Orphan") employs cin-
ematic techniques that entice the
audience and communicate the
film's suspense and desperation
well. The faded color palette of
Neeson's perpetually grim sur-
roundings capture the feel of
Berlin. The subtle experimenta-
tion with focusing messes with
the viewer's head in the same way
that Dr. Harris's is being tam-
pered with. Unfortunately for
Collet-Serra, good direction and a
hot blonde aren't enough to carry
a film.

Alien thriller Four' is a charm

By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily TV/New Media Editor
If there's one thing producer
Michael Bay knows how to do,
it's packaging films about super-
powered aliens
for the masses. **
His newest
endeavor, "I I Am Number
Am Number Fo
Four," based
on the novel At Quality16
by Pittacus and Rave
Lore, follows
the tradition Disney
of "Transform-
ers" and presents sci-fi action in
its most digestible and entertain-
ing form.
"I Am Number Four" stars the
U.K.'s newest import, Alex Pet-
tyfer ("Alex Rider: Operation
Stormbreaker"), in the title role.
Number Four - known by his
alias, John Smith - is one of nine
aliens from the planetLorien who
seek refuge on Earth from the
malevolent Mogadorians. After
the first three are killed - the
first scene is a particularly adren-
aline-charged hunt that results
in Number Three's death - Four
has to hide or fight. While hiding
out in the fantastically obscure
Paradise, Ohio, John falls in love
with a human girl, Sarah (Dianna
Agron, TV's "Glee").
Pettyfer is no breakout thes-
pian, but he doesn't pretend to
be. He narrates the film in a deep,
sexy monotone and just happens
to be sinfully attractive enough to
make audiences forget his medio-
cre acting for the rest of time. The

ALBUM REVIEW
'King' goes out on limb

TV REVIEW
Not feeling the love for
CBS's newest show

Radiohead's surprise
release will grow
toward greatness
By ELLIOT ALPERN
DailyArts Writer
In the aura of mystique that has sur-
rounded Radiohead since its debut, Pablo
Honey, frontman Thom York dropped
another abrupt sur-
prise on delighted fans
everywhere in the form
of eight ethereal tracks. Radiohead
Announced just five
days before its intended The King
release (and four days of Limbs
before its actual one),
The King of Limbs is an Self-released
acute turn away from
2007's In Rainbows. The total runtime
is a scant 37 minutes, and the record will
be released as a purported "newspaper
album" on clear vinyl and with accompa-
nying pieces of artwork later this year. In
addition, Radiohead's latest is thoroughly
more abstract than anything the band
has put out to date.
Those new to Radiohead might not
know what to expect from the album,
and could be disappointed with the
result. It's full of Yorke's characteristic
falsetto, but lacks the driving force com-
monly present in past hits like "Creep"
and "Karma Police." In its absence,
King is unearthly yet organic, ranging
from celestial guitars to actual birdsong
(which sets up the dreamy "Give Up
The Ghost"). Principal impressions of
confusion and discouragement are plau-
sible byproductsupon the first listen, but
Radiohead has done again what it does
best - it's changed the game.
"Lotus Flower" is set over a rever-
berating bass line, and is the first single
released from the album. Yorke's philo-
sophical meanderings on life and free-
dom are punctuated only by a surgical
snare beat. The British singer unleashes

"All we want's a friend..."
lines like "... all I want is the moon upon
a stick / Just to see what it is" that will
snag the listener's attention long past the
final note. The following "Codex" is a
haunting piano ballad featuringthe Lon-
don Telefilmonic Orchestra. The track is
brimming with somber reflection and the
notion that innocence is worth preserv-
ing.
Though Kingis serene - and, at times,
truly beautiful -the brevityofthe record
is unnerving. It is strange that a four-
year break between albums could yield
just eight songs. What's more, there is
a great deal of material from live shows
(like "The Present Tense" and "The Daily
Mail") that was apparently cast aside. It
might be rash to suggest that Radiohead
will release a follow-up any time soon,
but consider the last track, "Separator."
The bright and uplifting finale finds
Yorke singing, "If you think this is over
/ Then you're wrong" close to its conclu-
sion. If there's anybody that would be
willing to pull such shenanigans, bet on it

being Radiohead.
This record will certainly have its
critics, as well as listeners that are
unwilling to devote the effort necessary
for full appreciation. Those looking for
an immediately likable album should
search elsewhere. Each listen brings
with it new understanding and discov-
ery - a line of lyrics here, a burst of gui-
tar there - and what each person takes
away from King is unique. Radiohead,
time and time again, accomplishes
something that is immensely difficult
to achieve even just once: freshness.
The record is vastly distinct from In
Rainbows, and until one fully grasps the
enormity of it, each run-through of The
King of Limbs is an individual experi-
ence. The moment it sinks in - whether
it occurs while taking a nature walk
or just finishing an assignment - will
seem like an epiphany of musical pro-
portions. It isn't old-school Thom Yorke
by any means, but with such a great
effort, it's something to be grateful for.

A good TV show can make us laugh. It
canmakeus cry. Itcanmakeus fall inlove
with the characters and welcome them
into ourlives like old
friends. Then there's .
another kind; the
kind that attempts Mad Love
to woo viewers into
believing it's one of Pilot
the good ones. These Mondays at8:30 p m.
do nothing but clothe MondayspCBS
themselves in the
reputations of others,
winding up as an insult to the audience.
It's sad to see such a show make it onto
network airwaves, but better to recog-
nize this menace early on than be tricked
by its innocent exterior. CBS's "Mad
Love" is such a show. It lowers the bar for
all television everywhere.
"Mad Love" stars Jason Biggs as Ben
Parr, a young New York City lawyer
searching for romance. His character
talks and acts so similar to Biggs's char-
acter from the "American Pie" franchise
it's laughable. The love interest in ques-
tion is Kate Swanson (Sarah Chalke,
"Scrubs"), another thirty-something
who's looking to find "the one." Unfor-
tunately, Chalke left her A-game back
at Sacred Heart hospital. For that mat-
ter, she left her B and C game as well.
Granted, it's not her fault her character
has the depth of a cardboard box and
spouts non-sequiturs masquerading as
one-liners. But it is her fault for walking
through the role and giving us only Dr.
Elliot Reed on a bad day.
The pilot episode opens with a
voiceover from Ben's best friend Larry
(Tyler Labine, "Reaper"). "This fairy
tale will be different because I'm telling
it," he says. It's an interesting premise,
yet it proceeds to depict an ordinary
boy-meets-girl storyline that goes
something like this: Ben and Kate meet
by chance at the top of the Empire State
Building due to a lucky mix-up with a
cell phone and a hat. From the moment
they set eyes on one another, there's a
connection that can't be denied. This

happens about five minutes into the epi-
sode. After this point things start to go
downhill - way downhill.
Ben and Kate both have annoying
best friends who offer obnoxious rela-
tionship advice. These friends can't
stand each other (though there is some
unnecessary sexual tension between
them). Ben screws things up with Kate.
Kate gets upset. Then she forgives him.
This process repeats itself over and over
again. Thus, this fairy tale is not differ-
ent. It's ordinary at best.
Young professionals searching for
love in the big city is a formula that's
worked well in the past - most recently
on CBS's "How I Met Your Mother," a
series creator Matt Tarses ("Scrubs")
clearly admires.
Like "How I Met
Your Mother,"
but nobody cares.
Sowhydoes "Mad Love" fall flat? The
primary reason is because, unlike other
sitcoms of the genre, there's no reason
to root for or even like these characters.
Many of the jokes are crude and bland.
The fairy tale gimmick is pointless and
adds nothing to the episode. Finally, the
episode doesn't hold together on a lin-
ear level. One minute they're in a bar,
the next they're at the apartment of
the boss of Kate's friend Connie (Judy
Greer, "27 Dresses") and then they're
in Ben's office. All this racing around
leaves little room for character devel-
opment. In short, by the episode's end,
exactly who these people are has yet to
be determined.
CBS must have been desperate for a
midseason replacement. It seems like all
they did was take a successful idea (i.e.
young lawyer looking for beautiful girl,
womanizing best friend, etc.) and tell us
the ending from the outset: The boy gets
the girl. This gives usviewers absolutely
zero incentive to continue watching.

rior to Saturday's contest against
Western Michigan, the Michigan
hockey senior class was in
agreementthat a come-from-behind
3-2 win against Notre Dame three
years ago was its most memorable moment at
Yost Ice Arena. Then-freshman forward Louie
Caporusso scored with 20.3 seconds left on the
clock to propel the Wolverines past the Fighting
Irish.
But on Senior Night this past weekend, senior
Carl Hagelin's game-tying and game-winning
goals - with just 2.9 seconds remaining in
overtime against the Broncos - might have
caused a stir in the minds of the seven-member
class.
"It definitely ranks up there as one of the
best games I've (seen) here at the University of
Michigan," senior Louie Caporusso said after
the win.
Hagelin tallied the Wolverines' final two
markers in the dramatic 5-4 victory on Saturday.
The comeback win completed the weekend
sweep of Western Michigan (9-8-9-5 CCHA,

a late-season game, where the
games are a little more important

into the NCAA Tournament and
what seed you get.
But Michigan didn't necessar-

to make the NCAA Tournament,
especially after their win on Fri-

the rise of Shawn Hunwick last

reminiscing to do. And like every

Boylan's heroics deliver key win

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
With five minutes remainingin
the Michigan women's basketball
team's game against Wisconsin on
Saturday, junior guard Courtney
Boylan had just two points.
But during the next five min-
utes, Boylan scored arguably the
most important eight points of
her career,
allowing the MICHIGAN 68
Wolverines WISCONSIN 66
to squeak by the Badgers, 68-66, in
Madison. The win left Michigan
in third place in the Big Ten stand-
ings with just two conference
games left to play.
"I guess it was just kind of my
turn at the end," Boylan said after
the game. "I saw some openings
driving the lane, and I was able to
make a few shots at the end, so it
was great."
It was her bucket with eight
seconds left that proved to be
the winner. With the game tied,
Boylan came off a screen and
drove left, cruised by the Wis-
consin defenders and finished the
drive with a kiss off the glass to
give the Wolverines the victory.
But early on, it was the Rachel
Sheffer show. The sophomore
forward scored Michigan's first
seven points of the game and 15 of
the team's first 20.
The Badgers dared her to
shoot the deep ball - and she
did. After Sheffer hit a 3-pointer
to start the game, Wisconsin (9-5
Big Ten, 14-12 overall) tightened
up its defense on the perimeter
and Sheffer moved her game
inside.
"All week, we practiced on them
doubling down, because Wiscon-
sin always doubles the post," Shef-
fer said. "But they weren't really
doing it alot in the first half, or as
much as we thought (they would).
So it was more one-one-one post-
ing."
Sheffer took advantage of the
one-on-one situations, converting
a myriad of post moves and hitting
layups with both hands, making it
look easy in the process.
"In the first half, she carried
us," Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth said .

Despite injuries, 'M' easily tops UIC

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Taking at least the top-two
spots in the first four events, the
No. 6 Michigan Men's gymnas-
tics team defeated No. 13 Univer-
sity of Illinois-Chicago this past
Saturday at Cliff Keen Arena.
Even without freshman Sam
Mikulak - the Wolverines top
vault competitor - and senior
Ben Baldus-Strauss, Michigan
still defeated the Flames 341.90-
322.70. Mikulak was suffering
from a sternum and lower back
problem and Baldus-Strauss
wore a sling on Saturday, while
recovering from a previous inju-
ry.
Senior Chris Cameron com-
peted after missing last week,
but his ailments aren't complete-
ly gone. The U.S. Senior National
Team member took third place
on the pommel horse and still
rings, but was troubled by falls
and poor dismounts on the high
bar and floor exercise. As he's
still recovering, he couldn't per-

fect most of his routines this
week in practice.
"(Cameron) wasn't prepared
well, and he's still battling some
mystery illness," Michigan coach
Kurt Golder said. "At least he
was better enough to feel like
'I can get in the meet,' but that
doesn't mean the preparation
has been there. Hopefully if he
can get feeling better, than we
can get him back on track and
back where he belongs."
But injured gymnasts aside,
senior's Thomas Kelley and
Ian Makowske, redshirt junior
Andrew Vance, sophomore
Rohan Sebastian and freshman
Michael Myler led the way for
Michigan
Kelley captured first place
on the parallel bars and second
place on the still rings and high
bar. And Myler took second place
on the pommel horse and floor
exercise, respectively.
Senior Adam Hamers equaled
his highest pommel horse score
of the season en route to win-
ning the event. On the pommel

horse, along with the still rings
and vault, the Wolverines swept
the events, taking first through
fourth.
"I thought I did pretty well,"
Myler said. "I've been struggling
a little bit on pommel horse late-
ly, butI kind of pulled it together
this week and focused more on
form and trying to maximize my
execution score."
Without the usual high vault
score of Mikulak, Sebastian
earned the event title. His score
of 15.75 surpassed his season-
best score.
Since UIC isn't one of the
strongest opponents Michigan
has faced this season, the Wol-
verines came into the competi-
tion with a different preparation.
"I felt the team today didn't
really rise to the occasion," Kel-
ley said. "We were trying to go
into this meet competing against
ourselves and competing against
our team score. I feel like we
performed to the standards of
our competition as opposed to
ourselves."

This was particularly evident
on the last two rotations.
After the fourth rotation, the
Wolverines led by 16.20. Nor-
mally on the last two rotations
- parallel bars and high bar -
Michigan is competing to earn a
victory. On Saturday, none of the
pressure to hit a set was there on
those last rotations.
"It's a little more difficult
when you know you've got them
beat," Golder said. "Sometimes
it's difficult to keep the incentive
up."
Michigan will have plenty
of opportunity for a close meet
next weekend as No. 4 Stanford
travels to Cliff Keen Arena. Last
season, the Cardinal were the
runner-up to the Wolverines at
the NCAA Championships.
"They're going to be coming
after us big time," Golder said.
"We are the target. They were, at
least I thought, supposed to win
NCAA's last year, and then we
knocked them off. I'm sure their
whole year since NCAA's has
been pointed to this meet."

IOWA
From Page 1B
had two fouls, and just as the
Hawkeyes (3-12, 10-17) were
gaining momentum, the Wol-
verine bench players hit the
floor and saw significant time
in the first half of a conference
matchup for the first time this
season. Sophomore guard Eso
Akunne scored his first basket
since playing in garbage min-
utes against Gardner-Webb on
Nov. 21:
And after the starters ran out
to a 14-4 lead to open the con-
test, the reserves stumbled and
allowed Iowa to take a 32-24
lead into halftime. The team's
frustration actually manifested
itself in a technical foul when
Beilein argued a call with four
minutes left in the half.
"It just seemed like every-
thing was going wrong," Mor-
gan said. "We stuck in there
together and battled. Then
coach got T'ed up, and we
foughtfor our coach, and for our

season. We hung on together
and battled this one out."
At the halftime buzzer,
almost as a microcosm of how
the whole first half went for
Michigan, Cartwright heaved
a shot from beyond the half-
court line and banked it in, giv-
ing the Hawkeyes an 11-point
lead at the half. But after both
teams hit the locker rooms, the
officials determined the ball
was still touching Cartwright's
fingertips as time expired, and
they took the three points off
the scoreboard.
In retrospect, it was just the
turning point Michigan needed.
"Those are the breaks of the
game," Beilein said. "We talk all
about strategies and all these
different things ... If that ball
was in his hands for one (less)
second, or one-tenth of a second
(less), we're sitting here and
(Iowa coach) Fran (McCaffery)
is the winning coach. It'sthe life
Fran and I have chosen to live."
In the second half, the Wol-
verine starters returned and
gradually pecked away at the

lead until tying the game up at
40 apiece 10 minutes into the
half, and the contest was neck-
and-neck the rest of the way.
With 14 seconds remainingin
regulation and Michigan down
by two, Hardaway Jr. took a
jump shot from the paint and
missed. Morgan grabbed the
offensive rebound and drew the
foul. At the line, he hit the first
free throw, and, after an Iowa
timeout, he hit the second to tie
the game, 65-65.
"We said, 'If (Morgan) gets a
rebound or he gets the ball near
the basket, you have to chop
him, make him earn it. Don't
let him lay it in,' " McCaffery
said. "That's what Bryce (Cart-
wright) did, and the kid made
both (free throws) - with the
timeout in between. Soyou have
to give the kid credit for that."
The Hawkeyes couldn't score
on the final possession of regu-
lation, and for the second time
this season - the first time since
playing Kansas on Jan. 9 - the
Wolverines forced overtime.
With the win, Beilein's squad

ERIN KIRKL ANC,
Redshirt freshman Jordan Morgan scored 18 points and grabbed eight
rebounds against the Hawkeyes.

picked up its fourth road win of
the season, adding to impressive
victories at Clemson, Michigan
State and Penn State. And with

three games left in the regular
season, the Wolverines are con-
fident they can make a push for
an NCAA Tournament bid.


HAGELIN
From Page 1B
obviously he did that. Maybe we
have to play the Swedish national
anthem every weekend."
On Saturday, with Western
Michigan grabbing a go-ahead
power play tally just three
minutes into the third period to
lead 4-3, Michigan would have to
come back for the second time on
the night in hopes of potentially
securing a victory - it had
bounced back from a 3-1 deficit in
the first period.
As play continued in the final
stanza, the Wolverines (18-7-1-
0, 21-9-4) pressed even harder,
particularly the line of Caporusso,
Hagelin and sophomore Chris
Brown. The Wolverines out-shot
the Broncos, 34-24, withsome of
the final shots obviously being
the most important.

It wasn't until 39.1 seconds
remained on the clock that
senior goaltender Shawn
Hunwick pulled for an extra
attack, and that Hagelin flicked
a soft wrister on net. The
puck deflected off a Bronco
defenseman's leg and squeaked
past goaltender Jerry Kuhn,
sendingYostinto a frenzy.
Following the game-tying
tally, Kuhn raised his arms
above his head in frustration - a
sign the momentum had swung
in Michigan's favor.
"I think they just had that
look in their eye," Berenson
said in the post-game press
conference on Saturday. "They
were tired. You could just see
them pushing through it in that
last minute."
The Yost faithful had to wait
less than 10 minutes of real
time to jump into a hysteria
once again. At the 4:31 mark of

overtime, the Wolverines went
on their fourth power play of
the game when senior forward
Scooter Vaughan was interfered
with.
Holding a 5-on-4 advantage
and having an earlier power
play goal to its credit, No. 11
Michigan had hopes of sending
its seven-member senior class
out with a victory in front of
the 6,838 people in attendance.
Sophomore defenseman Lee
Moffie carried the puck into
the Western Michigan (9-8-
9-5, 15-9-10) zone as seconds
remained, leaving a drop pass
for Hagelin. The co-captain let
a half slap shot go from the top
of the left circle with 2.9 seconds
left on the clock that banked off
the left post and.into the net to
cap off the dramatic comeback.
"Our classhad one of the most
intense Senior Night games,"
Hagelin said. "Today, we had

to battle back and show some
character."
The victory kept Michigan
just one point behind Notre
Dame for first place in the
CCHA, with two games for each
team remaining in the schedule.
Following the win, Hagelin
joked that he approached first-
year Bronco coach Jeff Blashill,
saying Blashill told him he'd get
a win against the Fighting Irish
next weekend in the last two
games of the regular season
But more important, the
Wolverines are slowly getting
some of the luck they didn't
receive last season - a year in
which they had to battle just to
make the NCAA Tournament. In
the current campaign, Michigan
is all but guaranteed a lock for its
21st straight tourney.
"When you win when you're
not supposed to win, I think
it's a sign," Caporusso said.

"It's a sign that maybe this is
the year for Michigan hockey.
Sometimes last year,we couldn't
getawin anditwastough. Every
game, we would get bad calls,
bad bounces and sometimes, it
works out for you. Hopefully
this is theyear."
After the game, the seven
seniors skated around Yost
- each donning a University
of Michigan flag and Hagelin
sporting a student-made
Swedish flag too, a token of
appreciation given to him by the
Children of Yost, the student
cheering section.
"That's as good as it gets,"
Berensonsaid of the come-from-
behind win.
"Our crowd is so good. Our
players will never get to play
in front of crowds like this, the
enthusiasm and all the little
things going on. It doesn't get
any better than this."

stripe. The Hawkeyes cashedF
in the freebies, as the Wolver-
ines watdhed their 10-point
lead dwindle away. Arguably
because of the fouls, Beilein
went to the bench and Iowa
took an eight-point advan-
tage going into halftime.
NOTHING FOR NOVAK:
For the first time this sea-
son, junior guard Zack Novak
was scoreless at the end of
regulation time. Novak's
first points didn't come until
overtime when he netted
two free throws. Those two
points were his only two of
the afternoon.
"Everybody has their
off day man," Morris said.
"Novak just had his today.
He didn't score until late,
but he's still out there work-
ing every play. It's not like he
gives up."
On top of his little offen-
sive production, Novak
fouled out by the game's end.
His first two personal fouls
came in the first half, which
forced Beilein to play fresh-
man Colton Christian for the
end of the first frame - when
Iowa took a 10-point lead.
All five of Novak's fouls
were the result of him try-
ing to draw a charge. Unfor-
tunately for Novak, all five
attempts failed.
"That's part of the game,"
junior guard Stu Douglass
said. "(Novak) was a little
unlucky because he was like
0-for-5 at drawing charges.
Who knows? Next game he
could draw five charges."
Shooting 0-for-10 from the
field, Novak still collected
three rebounds, two assists,
and a steal. But his fouls
forced him to play conserva-
tively in the second half.
FOUL PLAY: It wasn't
just Novak who posed foul-
ing problems for Michigan.
The Wolverines recorded
everything from tic-tac fouls
to technical fouls. Each of
Michigan's four other start-
ers collected three fouls
before the end of the game,
and freshman forward Evan
Smotrycz tallied two off the
bench.
What was most haunting
was the timeliness of them.
The Wolverines tallied 10
fouls before halftime and it

Miami (Ohio) in the CCHA Tour-
nament semifinals felt like a bonus
scoop of ice cream.
Despite its lack of a goal-scor-
ng magician, and despite Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson coming
into nearly every post-game press
conference pointing out five or six
ways his team could've lost, this
team believes it's the year.
"When you win when you're
not supposed to win, I think that's
a sign," senior forward Louie
Caporusso said after Saturday's
game. "That's a signthat maybe
this is the year for Michigan
hockey."
Caporusso and the rest of the
team have been around long
enough to know that when a

program is on its third straight
decade ofmaking the postseason
every single year, most people are
just bidingtheirtime untilthe
NCAAtouPnament.
So remember Saturday's game
for what it was - one of the
best sporting events you've ever
attended. Remember Hagelin's
two goals to remind everyone
that Michigan was Michigan and
Western Michigan was Western
Michigan. Remember the Senior
Night festivities, and the Class
of '11 doing pushups at center ice
after the game because according
to Hagelin, "It just felt like that
was a moment to do push-ups."
But if you're a Michigan fan,
you better hope this was the
beginning of the seniors' legacy -
not the end.

Lynch ends scoring drought with Unlikely source
three goals in sweep of Broncos Pateryn helps


By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Ninety days.
Sophomore forward Kevin
Lynch entered Yost Ice Arena for
a weekend series against West-
ern Michigan riding the worst
streak of any skater on the No.
11 Michigan hockey team - an
18-game pointless streak span-
ning nearly three months.
Lynch wasn't just snake-bit
- the monkey on his back had
evolved well beyond its infancy
stage.
But midway through the first
period of the Wolverines' 6-3
victory against the Broncos,
Lynch found a rebound off to the
side of Bronco goaltender Jerry
Kuhn and shoveled it into the
net. Streak snapped.
For the Grosse Pointe, Mich.
native, it was a sigh of relief
months in the making.
"A little while? It's been a long
time," Lynch said with a laugh
after the game. "It felt good to
give something to the team. I
thought I'd been playing well,
but it hasn't been going in for me.
"It was a really good feeling to
get the monkey off my back."
The goal - Lynch's seventh
of the season - brought confi-
dence. To ensure that the streak
was gone, Lynch knocked in his
second goal at the 11:15 mark of
the third period.
"We've explained to him, it's
not about scoring, it's about play-
ing well and playing hard and
playing good defense," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said Friday.
"When you're not scoring, you'd
better notget scored against. For
the most part Lynch has kept
himself in the lineup by work-
ing hard, and tonight he was
rewarded."
Lynch was on a tear, and he
left Broncos strewn in his wake.
The big-bodied forward was the
sheriff on the ice at Yost, pun-
ishing Western Michigan and
letting his physicality match the
ne*wffensive outpobringl'"
"Ijust think (Lynch) is playing
with a little more grit," Berenson
said. "Sometimes when you play
more physical, good things hap-
pen. When he quits hitting, he'll
probably quit scoring."

Blue offense roll

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan junior defenseman
Greg Pateryn is not primarily
known for his scoring ability -
he came into
this weekend's NOTEBOOK
series with just
10 points. The Wolverines ask
Pateryn to play a strong defense,
and anything he nets is a bonus.
But in Friday's 6-3 win over
Western Michigan, Pateryn had
the scoring touch from the get-
go. He scored his third goal of the
seasonand addedthree helpersto
get the Wolverine offense off to a
quick start - Pateryn couldn't
remember ever accounting for
four points in agame before.
"I don't think ever in my
hockey career," Pateryn said. "I
think the last time was maybe
high school when we beat a team
like 9-0 or something. Guys were
putting the puck in. (Senior for-
ward Scooter Vaughan has) been
scoring on every chance he's had
basically. (Sophomore forward
Kevin Lynch) put one in there for
me. (Sophomore forward Chris
Brown), good deflection, and
(senior forward Matt Rust) made
an unbelievable pass. You got to
give everyone else credit, notjust
myself."
Pateryn notched just six total
points last season - one goal and
five assists - but his increased
offensive production this year is
a good sign for a Michigan team
that looks to a different guy to
play hero each night. Pateryn's
offensive contributions on Fri-
day helped propelthe Wolverines
from the first goal onward. Just
seconds after Vaughan finished
servinghis penalty for elbowing,
Pateryn dished the puck to
Vaughanoutofthebox,who skat-
ed down theTight side and placed
the puck iiitheback ofthe net
"(Pateryn's) keeping the game
simple," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "We're asking our
(defensemen) to move the puck,
quick up the puck. He made that
play to Scooter coming out of

the penalty box. That was a little
bit of luck there, the timing and
everything, (but) that was a nice
play."
POWERPLAY PERKS UP: After
22 consecutive unsuccessful
power play attempts, on Satur-
day, the Wolverines showed that
all they needed was one more
chance.
On Friday, Western Michigan
didn't take any penalties, so the
Michigan man-advantage didn't
have an opportunity to see the
ice.
But on Saturday, when West-
ern Michigan defenseman
Dennis Brown went to the box
for tripping with 10 minutes
remaining in the first period,
the Wolverines didn't miss their
23rd opportunity. Junior defen-
seman Brandon Burlon ripped a
shot from the point that sopho-
more forward Kevin Lynch
deflected before the puck went
wide right of the net, hitting the
backboards.
Junior forward David Wohl-
berg picked the puck up on the
rebound and netted his 12th goal
of the season.
"It was a great finish, little bit
of luck, nice to see the power play
capitalize," Berenson said. "It
was nice to get a power play, and
good for our team."
Wohlberg's power-play tally
moves the junior into second on
the team in goals this season 4
but the Wolverine who leads the
team in goals, senior forward
Carl Hagelin, was also involved
in getting the man-advantage
unit going on Saturday.
Hagelin's game-winner with
just three seconds remaining in
overtime came onthe powerplay,
as Michigan went 2-for-4 with
seven shots on net with that unit
on Saturday.
"NOTES: With'thlg weekend's
sweep of the i'onil&i, Michig4.t
is all but guaranteed a top-two
finish in the CCHA. It needs
only one more point to do so...
Conference-leading Notre Dame
is currently one point ahead of
Michigan.

CHRIwDZ
Sophomore forward Kevin Lynch (11) snapped his 18-game scoring drought in Friday's 6-3 win with two goals.

The next night, Lynch proved
that Friday was no fluke.
In Saturday's 5-4 barnburner,
Lynch assisted on sophomore
forward David Wohlberg's pow-
er-play goal in the first period -
the team's first man-advantage
goal since a Jan. 22 matchup
against Alaska. In the following
period, Lynch scored the Wol-
verines' biggest goal of the first
59 minutes of the game - over-
shadowed only by senior for-
ward Carl Hagelin's late-game
heroics.
Just over two minutes into the
second frame, with Hagelin in
the penalty box for high-stick-
ing, Lynch showcased his scbr
ing finesse on a short-handed
attack. After picking up a loose
puck in his own end, Lynch
dashed the length of the ice on
a two-on-two with Wohlberg.
With Wohlberg covered and two

men converging on him, Lynch
split the defensemen with a nifty
toe-drag and wristed a shot past
Kuhn to tie the game at three
goals each.
"The short-handed goal was
huge - that got us back in the
game," Berenson said on Satur-
day. "Great play by Lynch. We've
had those go against us, as you
saw, and it was good to get that
one back."
This wasn't the same Lynch
whose inability to produce on
the offensive end had befuddled
both he and the coaching staff
for months.
Before last weekend's match-
up against Ohio State, Beren-
son shifted Lynch over from
right wing to center, his natural
position. The change didn't pay
dividends against the Buckeyes,
but it may have sparked Lynch
against the Broncos.

With time winding down
in the third period on Satur-
day, Lynch had four points on
the weekend, but the Wolver-
ines still trailed, 4-3. Berenson
called a timeout with 90 sec-
onds remaining to set up a final
stab at sending the game into
overtime.
When Michigan took the ice
coming out of the timeout, senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick was
on the bench and Berenson sent
Lynch as the extra attacker.
After three months of disap-
pointment, he'd earned the trust
of his coach.
A. minute later, Lynch Was
skating alongside Hagelin whe'n
the Swede deadlocked the game
with 40 seconds remaining.
The barn was ablaze, and
nobody more so than Kevin
Lynch - the weekend's most
unlikely hero.


BASEBALL
Wolverines swept in Big
East-Big Ten Challenge

SOFTBALL
'M' remains perfect on season

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
DailySports Writer
Their opponents' big innings
were too big and the Wolverines'
big innings
weren't big LOUISVILLE 6
enough in MICHIGAN 3
the opening
weekend of S.CHN 6S 1
the Michi-M
gan baseball UCONN 16
team's sea- MICHIGAN 9
son.
Michigan dropped all three
games of the Big Ten-Big East
Challenge in St. Petersburg, Fla.
after being outscored by a com-
bined 17 runs in the losses.
Pinpointing exactly where
the Michigan baseball team fell
short this weekend might be a
useless task, as the Wolverines'
inconsistent pitching, scattered
hitting and porous defense all
contributed to their fate against
Louisville, St. John's and Con-
necticut.
The crooked number wasn't
kind to Michigan (0-3) - high-
scoring innings hurt the Wolver-
ines in all three games.
"The number one thing we
preach is staying out of the big
inning," Michigan coach Rich
Maloney said. "And the big
inning occurs from walks, hit
batsmen or errors. That just
can't happen, but it did."
On Friday, No. 22 Louisville's
four-run second inning put the
Cardinals ahead, 5-0 - a deficit
Michigan chipped away at, but
couldn't overcome en route to a
6-3 loss.
Two four-run innings on Sat-
urday helped No. 31 St. John's
make easy work of the Wolver-
ines in the Red Storm's 13-6
victory. Michigan sophomore

starting pitcher Ben Ballantine
was chased in the fourth inning
after surrendering six runs on
nine hits, capped by a three-run
double from sophomore outfield-
er Jeremy Baltz.
"There were several times
where we could have stopped the
bleeding if we would have been
able to make one more pitch in a
pressure situation," Maloney said,
pointing to Baltz's base-clearing
double. "That one pitch set the
momentum on fire for them. Had
we made that pitch and got out
of the situation, the whole game
could have been different."
And Sunday, it was shoddy
defense that led to No. 17 Con-
necticut's big innings - a six-
run second inning and a five-run
third. With two outs and only
one run across in the second
inning, sophomore shortstop
Derek Dennis committed an
error on a fielder's choice that
would have ended the inning.
Five runs later, the blowout
was on. Michigan tallied four
errors on the day, which led to
six unearned runs.
But despite the weekend's
deflating results, Michigan did
receive promising performances
from a handful of players. Sopho-
more first baseman Garrett Ste-
phens went 4-for-12 and knocked
in eight of the Wolverines' 18
runs in the Challenge.
Meanwhile, freshman right-
fielder Michael O'Neill"- neph-
ew of former major leaguer
Paul O'Neill - earned his way
into the third spot in the lineup
against Connecticut to finish
5-for-11 in the series.
He also starred in the field,
gunning down two runners with
outfield assists and registering a
running catch. Maloney said it

was just the second time he has
batted a freshman third in the
lineup.
"It's a big confidence boost
that Coach has confidence in
me to hit me third - that's big,"
O'Neill said. "I think guys on the
team know that (I'm) for real."
Michigan also had to deal
with some of its players getting
their first starts collegiate starts.
Stephens, O'Neill, redshirt soph-
omore infielder Kevin Krantz
and freshman third baseman
Alex Lakatos all started their
first games this weekend.
"We're going
to be going
through some
growing pains."
"We've got a lot of guys who
don't have experience that we
have a lot of confidence in and
that we think over time are
going to be really good players,"
Maloney said. "We're going to
be going through some grow-
ing pains and we have a very
difficult schedule to go through
those growing pains."
In order to make sure that
the Wolverines' come out with
their first win of the season next
weekend, Maloneysaid improve-
ment on pitching and defense
would be emphasized this week
in practice.
"We just have to get better so
that at some point we can learn
from all these experiences,"
Maloney said.

Wolverines defeat
Massachusetts
to capture FAU
Kickoff Classic title
By EMILY BONCHI
DailySports Writer
After three shutouts, nine
home runs and five wins, the
No. 11 Michigan softball team
clinched top honors at the Flor-
ida Atlantic University Kickoff
Classic
this past UMASS 1
weekend MICHIGAN 5
and kept
an unblemished record.
After going 4-0 during Fri-
day's and Saturday's matchups
in Boca Raton, Fla., the Wol-
verines earned first-seed hon-
ors, facing Massachusetts in
the bracket championship for a
weekend rematch.
"I thought today was one
of our best efforts," Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins said after
the game. "It was a very com-
petitive game against a good
UMass team and a very good
pitcher.
"We've got a lot of work to do,
we've got a lot of new-kids. We
are definitely getting better."
For the first time this sea-
son, Michigan (10-0 overall)
dropped a game's first run, after
an error allowed Minutewoman
Jordan Storro onto first base in
Sunday's championship game.
She eventually stole her way
around the diamond, scoring
the first run of the game.
Michigan quickly rebounded
in the bottom of the first, put-
ting its own tally on the board.
After two consecutive singles by
freshman outfielder Nicole Sap-
pingfield and senior first base-
man Dorian Shaw, junior third

baseman Amanda Chidester
singled up the middle to send
Sappingfield home.
Three scoreless innings
passed, with most of the work
coming off the defensive ends
of each team. Massachusetts
pitcher Sara Plourde registered
one strikeout, while Michigan
pitchers sophomore Stephanie
Speierman and senior Jordan
Taylor (who came into the game
during the fourth inning) each
sent two girls back to the dug-
out.
The Wolverine offense found
new life in the bottom of the
fifth, as junior Bree Evans
made the most of a Minute-
women error and a wild pitch
by Plourde to work her way into
scoring position.
With one out, Shaw sent a
deep sacrifice fly to left field -
giving Evans the opportunity to
score and put Michigan in the
lead.
"We all wanted to win that
last game," Evans said. "And we
knew it was a tough pitcher so
we all adjusted, and the major
difference is that we ended up
having a better outcome on this
one."
The Wolverines pulled
farther ahead after two
sixth-inning home runs by
sophomores Ashley Lane and
Amy Knapp.
Michigankept Massachusetts
off the board for the remainder
of the game, beating them for
the second time in two days, 5-1.
"We have a number of girls
that have been waiting in the
wings," Hutchins said. "You
look at Marley Powers, who's
a senior. And you look at Amy
Knapp and Ashley Lane, and
those are people who really need
to step in and help us be success-
ful throughout the course of the
season. They've all been doing
their part and contributing."

The Wolverines kicked off
the tournament last Friday with
a doubleheader against Long
Island and Classic host Florida
Atlantic.
Taylor led Michigan against
the Blackbirds, throwing her
seventh career no-hitter to give
the Wolverines the 6-0 shut-
out to start the weekend. Later
that day, Speierman followed
suit, blanking the owls in five
innings, 11-0.
Friday also included strong
offensive performances, paced
by two home runs apiece by
Shaw and Lane.
Michigan's success continued
into Saturday's double-header
with closer games against Tulsa
and Massachusetts.
Taylor continued to dominate
on the mound, tossing a one-hit-
ter and striking out 10 against
the Minutewomen, as the Wol-
verines took the first meeting of
this series, 3-0.
"It's my senior year and I
don't want to start it off poor,
Taylor said.
Michigan's closest game
of the weekend series came
against Tulsa. After Evans and
Sappingfield led off in the first
inning with back-to-band sin-
gles, Chidester broke the game
open early with a two-run dou-
ble, sending both base runners
back to the plate.
The inning was retired with
the Wolverines already leading
3-0, but an offensive surge start-
ing in the third inning by Tulsa
prompted the veteran Taylor to
come in for Speierman to earn
her second save of the season.
Michigan took the game, 4-3,
and earned the top slot for the
bracket championship.
Coming off their best start in
years, the Wolverines will con-
tinue tournament play in Flor-
ida during Michigan's spring
break trip next weekend.
