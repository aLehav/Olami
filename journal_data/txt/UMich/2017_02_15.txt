Jack Hu, vice president for 

research at the University of 
Michigan, said last January his 
goals for his tenure as head of 
one of the nation’s best research 
facilities included improvement 
in 
undergraduate 
research 

opportunities, 
supporting 

faculty research initiatives and 
broadening 
multidisciplinary 

collaboration of projects across 
the University.

In 
a 
one-year 
follow-up 

interview on Feb. 9, Hu reinforced 
the role the University’s Office 
of Research plays in launching 
new 
initiatives 
and 
making 

progress in future prospects — 

particularly amid a changing 
social, technological and political 
climate.

Hu highlighted in particular 

the goals of the office in terms 
of innovation and collaborative 
efforts 
with 
international 

industry partners.

Partnerships 
completed 

throughout the first year of 
Hu’s tenure include those with 
Frontt 
Capital 
Management 

Ltd., a Chinese investment firm, 
for work on new driverless 
vehicle technology, and with the 
Beijing Institute of Collaborative 
Innovation.

The BICI, Peking University 

and the University developed 
the 
concept 
of 
this 
global 

collaboratory and drove its agenda 

A 
resolution 
to 
fund 

lunches to strengthen the 
dialogue 
between 
pro-

Palestine 
and 
pro-Israel 

students 
on 
campus 
was 

vetoed by Central Student 
Government President David 
Schafer this weekend, but 
was brought up again at CSG’s 
weekly meeting on Tuesday. 
The authors of the resolution 
argued that the Schafer’s veto 
was 
unconstitutional 
and 

moved to bring the resolution 
back to a vote, which would 
need a two-thirds majority of 
support to override the veto. 

 The override to the veto 

failed 
to 
pass 
with 
the 

required majority, with 14 
votes in favor, 12 opposed and 
1 abstaining. 

 
CSG 
Vice 
President 

Micah Griggs, an LSA junior, 
reiterated her reasoning for 
supporting Schafer’s veto of 
the resolution.

 “About this resolution, 

it was very one-sided, and 
I’m just being honest,” said 
Griggs. 
“Everything 
that 

happens on a national or 
international level does affect 
students on this campus. 
However, if I were to put 
forth a resolution that said 
I want to talk about police 
brutality and I need $200 for 
lunches, do you think this 
would have the same outcome 
as this resolution?”

 
The 
authors 
of 
the 

resolution stated they will 
continue their efforts to use 
legislative money to fund 
lunches 
that 
further 
the 

Israel 
Palestine 
dialogue 

highlighting the importance 
of a constructive effort to 
tackle the delicate subject on 
campus. 

Student 
Government 

representative 
Gaby 
Roth, 

an LSA junior, explained 

why the resolution should 
be enacted despite the veto 
because of the nature of how 
power to spend allocated 
money is dictated in the 
Central Student Government 
constitution.

“We feel that because this 

resolution was asking for 
funds from the legislative 
discretionary 
account, 
it 

should 
be 
the 
legislative 

branch that determines the 

use of these funds,” she said. 
“And just as we wouldn’t have 
a place in determining the 
place of the executive funds, 
the same goes the other way. 
”

 Rackham Student rep. 

Andy 
Snow 
supported 

Roth’s sentiments about the 
legislative 
branch’s 
power 

to use their allocated money 
without intervention from 

The 
day 
after 
President 

Donald Trump won the election, 
critically acclaimed poet and 
educator 
Terrance 
Hayes 

immediately began writing. The 
result? A collection of more than 
30 sonnets titled “American 
Sonnets for my Past and Future 
Assassins.”

More than 70 students and 

faculty 
members 
gathered 

Tuesday 
night 
inside 
the 

University of Michigan Museum 
of Art to listen as Hayes read 
excerpts from his anthology 
of work, discussing concepts 
of race, popular culture and 
modern masculinity in a lyrical 
manner. 

The 
poet 
received 
the 

prestigious 
MacArthur 

Fellowship 
in 
2014 
for 

outstanding creative work and 
is the author of “Lighthead,” 
winner of the 2010 National 
Book Award. His most recent 
publication, “How to Be Drawn,” 
was a 2015 National Book Award 
finalist.

Hayes said explicitly that 

most of the sonnets were written

A documentation of some of the stories of displaced people coming to the state seeking safety

Rania Daboul remembers having 

to call her older brother who was 
6,000 miles away from her, anxiety 
building about her future.

She was stuck in Jordan, taking 

care of her three younger siblings 
while her parents were in the 
United States. There were a lot of 
times when Daboul felt as if she had 
no academic future and no possible 
way to accomplish her dream of 
becoming a doctor like her brother.

She would call him, unable to 

actually leave Jordan to join the rest 

of her family, thinking she had no 
hope, that it was all over.

After living in Jordan without her 

parents for two years, Daboul finally 
received the call from her family 
that they would be coming to United 
States, gaining refugee status after 
two long years, a process that should 
have only lasted six months.

Daboul still remembers jumping 

up and down on her bed the whole 
day. She was moving farther away 
from her native country of Syria, 
but she would finally be reunited 
with her family in yet another new 
country.

She is now an LSA sophomore,

happy valetines day our 5 page 
midterm is due tomorrow....

When the temperatures were 

higher than normal in January, 

many believed the weather 

would get back to normal soon. 

Winter months at the 

University of Michigan normally 

consist of below-freezing 

temperatures and a lot of snow. 

But here, in the middle of 

February, some might say Spring 

Break has arrived early.

Many students have 

expressed their appreciation of 

the sunny days. The Michigan 

Students account wrote on 

Twitter, “Ann Arbor’s sunshine 

and clear, blue skies is making 

me feel all kinds of happy 

today!”

Despite a positive reaction to 

the warmth, a new study led by 

Ian Winkelstern, a postdoctoral 

researcher in the Department 

of Earth and Environmental 

Sciences at the University, 

found this latest warming to be 

harmful to rising sea levels.

The last time it was this 

warm, cold water that had 

melted from Greenland’s ice 

sheets was flowing as far 

down the Atlantic Ocean 

as Bermuda, altering the 

ecosystem and changing the 

ocean’s climate. Winkelstern 

told the Michigan News this 

could destroy the coral reefs 

of Bermuda, flood North 

America and cause Europe’s 

temperature to drop.

“If a big enough chunk of 

Greenland falls off, which has 

clearly happened in the past 

and has clearly caused these 

dramatic changes in the past, 

there’s no reason to think 

it couldn’t happen again,” 

Winkelstern told the Michigan 

News. “We’re doing a pretty 

good job of melting it right now.”

Regardless of whether this 

warm-up is from the effects of 

climate change, get ready for the 

warm days and sunny skies to 

continue this weekend and next 

week.

ON THE DAILY: CAMPUS WEATHER HEATS UP FOR VALENTINES

HAYLEY MCLAUGHLIN/Daily

LSA English professor Walter Cohen presents on issues of the Jewish identity and modern-
ist fiction in the Thayer building on Tuesday. 

FACT AND FICTION

championed affordable housing 
reform this year, while Sarkar 
advocated for increased mental 
health resources as a part of the 
Mental Health Leaders Network 
last 
year. 
eMerge’s 
executive 

candidates, though, are shaping 
their campaign around more than 
policy credentials.

Together, if voted into office, 

the pair would be the first women 
elected on one ticket as president 
and vice president since at least 
1993. 

Much of the excitement about 

eMerge’s launch, and indeed 
the party’s platform as a whole, 
centers around these questions 
of identity and inclusion. Driving 
the platform is Sarkar and Jawad’s 
aim to broaden the base of voices 
in student government, to include 
groups on campus not familiar 
with, or even faithful in, CSG.

“It’s about representation and 

empowerment,” Sarkar said. “We 
want students to speak without 
us necessarily speaking for them. 
Some students don’t feel like 
CSG does anything for them … 

CSG should listen and not be 
autonomous because 10 people in 
a room don’t know what’s best for 
43,000.”

Jawad, clad in hijab, is quick 

to 
clarify 
neither 
candidate 

represents all women of color. 
She 
agreed, 
though, 
that 

as 
a 
low-income 
Lebanese-

American Muslim, the politics of 
representation greatly affected her 
time on CSG. The average member 
of CSG, a recent demographics 
self-survey reported, is white, 
hetereosexual and male — and 
37.2 percent of the governing body 
comes from homes earning more 
than $250,000 a year. 

“Our identities are pivotal,” 

Jawad said. “There is power 
working with students different 
from yourself, and me being 
different is a new avenue for 
students who look like me. My 
identities haven’t been represented 
before. I want them to know this is 
a real thing you can do.”

“I forced myself to break the 

homogeneity,” Sarkar said. “Some 
people told us not to run together 
as two women of color, and that 
to me was the most empowering 
thing. We can still win … we know 
how important it is to bring people 
who look like us to the table.”

Current CSG Rep. Arlyn Reed, 

an LSA junior, hasn’t endorsed 
eMerge, but lauded Sarkar and 
Jawad’s credentials.

“Even talking to my friends, a lot 

of people are asking if they can do 
it,” she said. “And they absolutely 
can. I think representation is 
important, and that this is really 
cool.”

In a year fraught with racial 

tension and political anxiety, 
eMerge hopes to foster unity and 
collaboration, 
following 
much 

in the footsteps of Schafer’s 
stated goals. Many of its short-
term policy proposals, labeled 
“hold us to it,” were crafted 
with the entire student body in 
mind. Such initiatives include 
stronger Wi-Fi on the Diag and 
off campus, improved bathroom 
facilities and making phone and 
computer chargers available at 
on-campus study spots. Campaign 
Communications Director Cassie 
Fields, an LSA junior, said the 
goals are simple, but tangible.

“We want to make it easier for 

students to be students, and (make) 
campus more accessible,” she said. 
“There’s no false advertising.”

Jawad agreed small barriers to 

accessibility can often amount to 
significant hurdles. She strives to 

create a centralized hub for 
students to find both resources 
and avenues to lobby for 
even more. This year, Jawad 
helped launch the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship, 

which 
is 
geared 
toward 

alleviating 
the 
economic 

burden 
of 
extracurricular 

activities. 

“Coming from economic 

hardship, 
I 
know 
how 

important it is to convey 
those resources,” she said. 
“The economic disparity is 
really reflected in student 
engagement.” 

eMerge 
accordingly 

weaves inclusion into most 
of its broader goals: creating 
mentorship 
programs 
for 

non-traditional, multilingual 
and first-generation students; 
connecting students to service 
opportunities and expanding 
in-state tuition benefits to 
undocumented graduate and 
non-traditional students.

Wednesday, February 15, 2017 — 3A

since fleeing Syria more than six 
years ago. After members of her 
family were kidnapped and others 
received threats, her father’s side 
of the family decided to flee from 
Damascus, Syria to Jordan. Like 
so many others, their journey to 
the United States was a long and 
stressful one.

Daboul’s 
older 
brother 
was 

already attending medical school 
in the United States when the 
family fled to Jordan. Once settled 
in Jordan, her parents decided to 
visit their eldest son in the United 
States. Once they were there, her 
parents decided to apply for visas 
and request refugee status.

The 
process 
was 
supposed 

to take six months — Daboul’s 
parents ended up waiting in the 
United States for two years without 
permission to leave the country 
except for a two-week trip to see 
their children. Daboul, the eldest 
of the four children left behind in 
Jordan, took on the role of cooking, 
cleaning and, in a general sense, 
being the parent while waiting for 
the U.S. government to allow her 
parents to come back to Jordan and 
bring them to join the rest of the 
family in Michigan.

“There were so many times in 

Jordan I would call my brother 
and be like, it’s over — I was a really 
dramatic kid,” Daboul said. “The 
day we found out we were going to 
America, I was jumping on the bed 
the whole day because I finally was 
able to join my parents and brother.”

In 
2011, 
the 
Arab 
Spring 

saw the end of two long-term 
administrations, 
Tunisian 

President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 
and Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak. Syria’s own protests 
developed into violence after the 
torture of 15 teenage boys who 
voiced support of the Arab Spring.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 

continued an assault on his citizens, 
detaining hundreds and beginning 
the civil war known as the Syrian 
conflict. The Free Syrian Army and 
the terrorist movement ISIS were 
born out of the struggle against 
al-Assad, leading to more than 
450,000 killed and 50 percent of 
the country’s pre-war population 
displaced.

As of December 2016, there 

are 4,873,248 refugees from Syria 
worldwide.

Daboul considers her family 

lucky since they left so early in the 
revolution and were able to move 
to the United States relatively 
smoothly, leaving before ISIS even 
became a prominent threat in the 
country.

“To me, most Americans think 

the only issue is ISIS,” Daboul said. 
“It was mainly an opposition to the 
president and ISIS isn’t as big as the 
media makes it to be. I was in Syria 
five years ago and ISIS didn’t exist 
back then. It bothers me. This isn’t 
to say ISIS isn’t a big deal … but now 
everything people talk about is ISIS, 
which is a big deal and we need to 
get rid of it but you’re not talking 
about the other main issue at all 

anymore.”

Michigan’s population
Michigan has the second highest 

population of Syrian refugees, 
with most residing in Troy and 
Dearborn. The state has the highest 
Arab population in the United 
States, containing 2 percent of the 
state’s population in 2015.

Tawfik Azalem, director of the 

U.S. Committee for Refugees and 
Immigrants in Detroit, said the 
group mostly settles refugees in 
Wayne and Macomb Counties — 
areas with large Middle-Eastern, 
Iraqi and Chaldean populations.

“Michigan 
is 
a 
welcoming 

state and immigration is a really 
great opportunity to grow our 
state,” Azalem said. “I truly think 
diversity is power. Michigan and 
the specifically Detroit metro area 
is one of the largest Middle-Eastern 
populations in the country.” 

Patrick 
McLean, 
a 
Syrian 

American Rescue Network board 
member, explained many refugees 
settle in Michigan through the 
network of past Syrian immigrants 
— he referred to Dearborn as the 
“heart of Arab-American culture.”

On Jan. 25, Ann Arbor City 

Council passed a resolution to 
protect immigrants from federal 
investigation — however, the city 
did not declare itself as a “sanctuary 
city.” This was in response 
to 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

executive order on the same day 
against sanctuary spaces that could 
potentially lose federal funding.

The attempt at an immigration 

ban

On Jan. 27 — International 

Holocaust Remembrance Day — 
Trump signed an executive order 
calling for suspended immigration 
from 
seven 
Muslim-majority 

countries such as Somalia, Yemen 
and Syria.

Trump’s order in return faced 

exceeding amounts of backlash, 
with protests sparking across the 
country. However, some viewed 
the immigration halt as a means of 
protecting the nation.

“Without question, what the 

current president is doing with his 
executive order is really creating a 
culture of fear among the refugee 
population 
and 
the 
broader 

immigrant population,” McLean 
said. “It is not going to make us safer 
— it has the potential to make us less 
safe, because it will make refugees 
and immigrant much more reluctant 
to deal with law enforcement and 
the broader community. It’s terribly 
misguided.”

However, McLean found hope 

in the support he saw throughout 
the country. On Jan. 29, thousands 
crowded in the Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport, chanting “Let them in” and 
welcoming arrivals.

The ban received mixed reactions 

on campus. LSA senior Adam 
Mageed, president of the campus 
University Muslim Coalition, said 
in late January the policy ignores 
refugees whose lives could be in 
greater danger.

“I think that Americans are 

incredibly safe and take their safety 
for granted,” Mageed said. “Security 
at the cost of heavy discrimination 
isn’t security.”

Some on the conservative side 

disagreed, believing the ban to 
be vital for national security. LSA 
junior Enrique Zalamea, president 
of the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans, said in an 
earlier interview that it was the 
government’s 
duty 
to 
uphold 

security.

“I 
am 
a 
first-generation 

American, and I love this country, 
but I would rather have a more 
secure immigration process in order 
to reduce the risk of future terrorist 
threats,” Zalamea said. “It truly 
bewilders me to see so many people 
protesting what is essentially a vital 
step towards proving our national 
security.”

After the ban was announced, 

University President Mark Schlissel 
said he would not turn over 
students’ immigration information. 
Michigan Attorney General Bill 
Schuette, however, backed the 
order, insisting it was not a Muslim 
ban but “placing the security of 
Americans first.”

Gov. Rick Snyder, along with 31 

other governors, placed a temporary 
ban on the entry of Syrian refugees 
into the state following the terrorist 
attacks November 2015 in Paris. 
Snyder’s 
ban 
prompted 
many 

University faculty and staff to speak 
out against the governor’s actions. 
In an interview, that November, 
History Prof. Pamela Ballinger 
expressed her dismay with the 
states ban. 

“The 
growing 
chorus 
of 

governors who wish to block 
resettlement of Syrian refugees in 
their states is a worrisome, yet sadly 
predictable, response to the terror 
attacks in Paris,” Ballinger said. 
“These governors displace blame 
onto the literally displaced, victims 
forced to flee their homes as a result 
of the same extremist violence that 
shook Paris last week. Such a view 
ignores that the U.S. commitment to 
take Syrian refugees is already low, 
as well as the fact that the process of 
refugee vetting in the U.S. is a slow 
and careful one.”

On Feb. 9, the federal court 

rejected the appeal for Trump’s 
travel ban on the basis that there 
was no evidence of that anyone had 
committed terrorist acts from the 
seven countries. Despite Trump’s 
claims the court had no power on 
his order, the ban was disabled.

Yet 
uncertainty 
still 
reigns 

throughout 
the 
country 
— 

with 
refugees, 
immigrants, 

undocumented 
individuals 
and 

organizations 
unsure 
how 
to 

shape their futures based on the 
contentious political climate.

The 
U.S. 
Committee 
for 

Refugees and Immigrants is a 
national refugee program, federally 
funded, that addresses the needs 
of refugees worldwide, supporting 
a transition to the United States. 
USCRI 
attempts 
to 
provide 

refugees 
with 
transportation, 

housing and other necessities in the 
first 30 to 90 days they are in the 
country. Other programs include 
aid in employment and family 
counseling. They also must have a 
health screening within the first 30 
days of arrival.

for 
global 
challenge-centered 

goals. Though other universities 
are also able to get involved, these 
three central participants have 
already applied this model to 
establish a global collaboratory in 
advanced manufacturing.

The University has been on the 

forefront of driverless technology 
nationally 
and 
internationally 

with the creation of Mcity, the 
simulated urban-suburban driving 
environment located on North 
Campus that prototypes and tests 
automated vehicles.

Carrie Morton, deputy director 

of the Mobility Transformation 
Center — established in 2013 as 
a partnership program within 
academia that expands to include 
industry 
and 
government 
— 

said Mcity is the MTC’s largest 
contribution to the University’s 
research 
interests. 
Morton 

highlighted 
its 
significance 

in terms of drawing partners 
and 
government 
involvement, 

especially 
through 
the 

Department of Transportation 
both statewide and nationwide.

“We have been able to grow 

our 
research 
portfolio 
well 

beyond 
the 
technology 
and 

we’re starting to get a better 
understanding of how humans 
interface with these technologies, 
which is really important when 
we try to understand consumer 
acceptance,” Morton said.

Morton outlined much of the 

progress that has been made 
with 
regard 
to 
intelligence 

infrastructure, including a new 
traffic control center, the launching 
of TechLab — an initiative with 
the Center for Entrepreneurship 
where early-stage companies are 
launched at the MTC — and having 
open connected and automated 
vehicles. This fleet of two vehicles, 
professionally established as drive-
by-wire vehicles, hold the goal of 
creating a platform allowing MTC 
researchers to speed innovation 
and reduce the normal barriers of 
working on these technologies.

“We really have a wonderful 

glide path to be able to deploy what 
we learn in the real world very 
quickly,” Morton said.

Hu also initiated a student 

Scholars 
Program 
through 

MCubed — which stimulates 
innovative 
research 
and 

scholarship through distributing 
real-time 
seed 
funding 
to 

multidisciplinary, 
faculty-

headed 
research 
teams 
for 

undergraduates. 
$4000 
is 

allocated 
for 
each 
accepted 

undergraduate 
participant 
for 

summer work. The graduate level 
program is similar but allocates 
$8,000 per student to those 
involved.

“I’m 
very 
supportive 
of 

undergraduate 
research,” 
Hu 

said. 
“Everywhere 
I 
travel, 

people talk about their research 
experience, how undergraduate 
research really enabled them to 
be independent thinkers, define 
problems, solve problems, drawing 

a conclusion or writing a report.”

New Initiatives
Another program of Hu’s is 

the Exercise and Sport Science 
Initiative, which aims to optimize 
health and athletic performance, 
co-directed by Kinesiology Prof. 
Ron 
Zernicke. 
The 
initiative 

involves collaboration from the 
fields of data science and analytics, 
new 
sport 
technologies 
— 

including design and prototyping 
— and performance optimization.

Zernicke, 
who 
focuses 
on 

optimal 
performance, 
was 

appointed 
to 
co-direct 
the 

initiative 
with 
biomedical 

engineering Prof. Ellen Arruda 
last September. Zernicke said he 
has found Hu to be supportive 
of cross- and interdisciplinary 
research 
branching 
multiple 

sectors of the University in many 
ways.

Though a new program, the 

ESSI has conducted research 
that could hold implications not 
only for athletes, but also for the 
medical field, particularly through 
recording 
technology 
useful 

for critical care units in terms 
of monitoring individuals’ life 
sciences measurements, care input 
and nutrition.

Zernicke cited the ESSI as a way 

to solve social problems, establish 
a business venture and hold 
corporate partnerships, all within 
the multidisciplinary expertise of 
the University.

“One of the intriguing things 

is that Michigan has the health 
system here — including the sports 
medicine — it has the athletics, 
and it has all of these other 
multiple schools and colleges,” 
Zernicke said. “What I was most 
impressed with Jack was that he 
basically saw this as a way of really 
integrating the breadth and depth 
of Michigan to look at significant 
societal needs and maintaining 
health and wellness.”

DEI
In terms of the role the office 

plays in University President Mark 
Schlissel’s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan — a five-year plan 
aiming to create a more inclusive 
campus environment and promote 
a more diverse climate — Hu said 
he fully supports the University’s 
efforts.

“We support the president’s 

plan and I also truly believe 
diversity is very conducive to 
innovation,” 
Hu 
said. 
“From 

a 
company 
perspective, 
I 

understand exactly why there is 
interest in this, because for any 
company that provides services 
or products, their customers are 
diverse, so you must understand 
their needs and preferences. You 
want your product team and 
marketing team and everyone to 
understand what your customers 
want … a diverse team is very good 
for innovation. Because we are a 
research organization, I believe in 
that as well.”

Through service and research 

units, the Office of Research’s 
specific 
DEI 
plan 
aims 
to 

strengthen and expand the office’s 
educational offerings that promote 
the goals of the DEI, increase 
the diversity of its staff through 

targeted recruitment strategies 
and improve external outreach to 
corporate partners, governmental 
agencies and foundations.

Challenges
One challenge Hu said he has 

faced includes involving differing 
sciences in University research.

“We have been trying to 

promote the participation of the 
faculty and schools in the social 
sciences,” Hu said, specifying this 
particularly applies to Mcity.

Hu highlighted understanding 

consumer 
behavior 
and 

acceptance to autonomous cars, 
legal and ethical issues with 
autonomous driving and a need 
for increased business models 
in 
response 
to 
autonomous 

vehicles are all facets of social 
sciences that can contribute to the 
studies of technology’s impact on 
transportation and employment 
opportunities.

“If a lot of things are automated 

in manufacturing, service and 
transportation, then we don’t 
need that many drivers, we don’t 
need that many workers, so what 
do people do? This is a critical 
discussion I think the country as a 
whole needs to have.”

LSA senior Adedolapo Adeniji, 

an 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity 
Program 
social 

sciences peer advisor, said she has 
been involved with UROP since 
her freshman year.

“I’ve found myself utilizing a lot 

of the skills that I learn through 
research in class,” Adeniji said. “I 
think people undervalue the role 
research can play in your everyday 
college life.”

Adeniji said the issue is not 

the University’s lack of focus on 
social science research, but rather, 
a negative stigma attached to 
research that is not based on data 
science and mathematics.

“I think there’s a common 

misconception 
that 
research 

is a hard science,” Adeniji said. 
“That research is math. That 
research is only for people who 
are pre-med, or that research is 
chemistry or physics ... and that’s 
a misconception I had when I 
came into college when UROP was 
introduced to me.”

Both Morton and Zernicke 

expressed interest in further 
collaboration with the social 
sciences as well.

“There’s such a strain on the 

talent pipeline right now,” Morton 
said. “The heart of what we’re 
doing that is so unique is providing 
this real-world data about how 
these technologies are used and 
how they’re deployed, and so 
getting further engagement with 
the social sciences will be really 
important for us in the next year to 
continue to get a glimpse into the 
future.”

One initiative that Morton 

said 
has 
improved 
the 

multidisciplinary 
dialogue 

between Mcity and law students 
was the University Law School’s 
creation of two new courses 
focused on studying multifaceted 
issues within the MTC.

the executive board.

 “First, I agree with them 

constitutionally,” 
Snow 

said. “And second, whether 
or not you like it, I want to 
understand, 
your 
thought 

process to take our money 
from us. Because that is what 
you’re doing.”

 The executive branch of 

Central Student Government 
has expressed its reservations 
for the proposed resolution 
because of its exclusivity 
and its lack of precise details 
regarding the time, location, 
size and mediation of the 
discussion lunches. 

 However Devin Jones, an 

LSA senior who identified 
as 
a 
Palestinian 
student, 

noted the privateness of the 
proposed lunches were due 
to the sensitivity of the topic.

 “These are people who 

identify as pro-Israel, and 
then on the other side you 
have people who identify as 
pro-Palestinian...the reason 
it is closed is something that 
could be debated,” Jones said. 
“I personally do not believe 
in CSG coming in and sitting 
in on meetings, because the 
meetings 
are 
discussing 

personal 
things 
that 
you 

have to be a part of the 

communities to understand.”

 After the vote, some CSG 

representatives 
expressed 

disheartenment at how much 
the vote in support of the 
Israel 
Palestine 
dialogue 

lunch resolution had changed 
since last week, when the 
resolution 
was 
supported 

widely by the body. 

 CSG representative Sheema 

Rehman, an LSA senior, also 
announced to the body that 
general lack of attention to 
the needs of the student body 
is a problem which should be 
addressed within CSG. 

 She mentioned the student 

sit-in 
last 
week 
saying 

she 
believed 
it 
is 
CSG’s 

responsibility to be present 
at such events when students 
are protesting to have their 
voices heard on key issues.

“On 
Thursday, 
Students 

for Justice held a sit in at 
the Michigan Union from 
5-2AM 
showing 
student 

frustration at the lack of the 
University’s 
response 
and 

calling CSG and members 
of 
the 
administration 
to 

listen to student concerns,” 
she said “But what was even 
more disheartening was the 
fact that we had very little 
representatives 
show 
up 

at any point- and this was 
a seven hour time period. 
Student’s aren’t asking for you 
to do much accept listen.”

CSG

in response to his thoughts 
regarding a Trump presidency, 
and he said one sonnet was printed 
on orange paper — to emulate the 
color of the president’s skin.

“Are you not the color of this 

country’s current threat advisory, 
and the poms-poms of a school 
whose mascot is a clementine?” 
Hayes 
read. 
“Light 
as 
a 

featherweight monarch, viceroy, 
goldfish.” 

Aside from the compilation of 

sonnets, Hayes also read longer 
poems from his 2015 work “How 
to Be Drawn.” In “American 
Sonnet for Wanda C.” he mused 
on the ways femininity is both 
portrayed and stereotyped.

“Who I know knows why all 

those lush-boned worn-out girls 
are whooping at where the moon 
should be, an eyelid clamped 
on its lightness,” Hayes read. 
“Nobody sees her without the 
hoops firing in her

ears because nobody sees. 

Tattooed across her chest she 
claims is bring me to where my 
blood runs and I want that to be 
here where I am her son, pent in 
blackness and turning the night’s 
calm loose and letting the same 
blood fire through me.”

I

’ve been waiting for years 
for a show to be made 
about 
photographers. 

The thrill of following light, 
seeking out stories 
and 
composing 

masterpieces 
offers 
the 
perfect 

ingredients 
for 
a 

captivating 
story. 

Enter: 
Netflix. 

Netflix 
recently 

introduced 
the 

Australian 
series 

“Tales 
by 
Light,” 

which 
follows 
an 

expert photographer 
in each episode. Needless to say, 
I binge-watched the first season, 
but something about the episode 
“Tribes” disturbed me. The show 
documents 
photographer 
Art 

Wolfe in Papua New Guinea as he 
attempts to “record what might 
not exist too far into the future.”

He speaks throughout the 

episode of his “obligation” to 
photograph the peoples, cultures 
and traditions of the places 
he visits. Is this photographer 
“running around third world 
countries 
objectifying 
their 

subjects to the fullest extent,” as 
one reviewer put it, any different 
from the influx of so-called 
humanitarian selfies seen on 
social media post-Spring Break? 
As alternative Spring Breakers 
gear up for their trips of a lifetime, 
it’s imperative they strongly 
consider replacing phones with 
full-on philanthropy.

To get a sense for the selfie 

epidemic — a selfidemic, if 
you will — everyone going on 
an alternative Spring Break 
should 
pay 
a 
visit 
to 
the 

viral blog, Humanitarians of 
Tinder. The page provides a 
steady flow of Tinder profiles 
featuring 
seemingly 
well-off 

20-somethings 
posing 
with 

impoverished 
individuals 
in 

foreign countries. It doesn’t take 
long for an innocent selfie taken 
with a kid in a school, orphanage 
or clinic to go through editing, 
filtering and captioning, directly 
reducing it from memory to 

marketing material. Don’t see 
the problem? At the center of this 
issue is the greater conversation 
on 
voluntourism, 
the 
ugly 

American 
and 
the 

white savior complex. 
Unsurprisingly, many 
of these problems are 
evident in Art Wolfe’s 
travels in “Tales by 
Light” and in many 
of our ASB Facebook 
albums.

When 
we, 
as 

students, go abroad 
in 
service, 
what 

do 
we 
stand 
to 

gain? Are we widening our 
worldviews? Or are we going 
abroad 
for 
popularity 
and 

profit? In the end, it’s a mixture 
of both. When Art Wolfe travels 
to Papua New Guinea out of a 
self-given obligation to preserve 
the 
cultures 
of 
indigenous 

tribes, he’s also focusing on the 
expansion of his photographic 
curriculum vitae. And that’s 
fine. But we have to be critical 
about serving abroad in order 
to increase our social media 
presence when doing so comes 
at the cost of the service itself.

It took a full year of reflection 

on my freshman year week-
long ASB in Guatemala to come 
to terms with this. I went on 
my first ASB as the student 
photographer in 2015 and took 
tens of thousands of photos 
for our host organization. The 
photos were to be used for 
donor recruitment — in a word, 
marketing. But to be fair, it was 
altruistic marketing with the 
goal of sustaining development 
efforts in Guatemala. Each photo 
began with my asking to take 
their photo, a scrambled, “¿Puedo 
tomar tu foto?” and was followed 
by uncomfortable smiles amid a 
firing of my camera shutter.

Eventually it got easier to take 

photos without receiving full 
consent. I assumed everyone 
would want their photo taken 
and wouldn’t care what was to 
be done with the picture. The 
same kind of socially required 

permission to photograph in the 
United States is thrown out the 
window when we, as student 
volunteers, begin documenting 
our 
trips. 
Throughout 
the 

“Tales by Light” episode, I 
uncomfortably 
watched 
as 

the 
photographer 
decorated 

multiple Papuans with paint 
and photographed them as full-
fledged models. What would 
constitute participation in the 
modeling industry in the United 
States is free labor from the 
Papuan. But this is an idea that 
escapes many. When we post pics 
with our friends, we tag them, 
and they presumably receive the 
benefits of social recognition. 
When we photograph models, 
we pay them, either in publicity 
or money. Why don’t we afford 
these same benefits to the people 
(read: “fellow human beings”) 
we serve?

I made a decision to put down 

the camera during my second 
year in Guatemala and couldn’t 
be happier with my decision. My 
focus shifted from self-promotion 
to service. My concern was no 
longer photographing the child 
on his way to getting his vitals 
checked, but checking his vitals 
and monitoring his health. So my 
greatest exhortation to anyone 
going on an ASB: Think about 
why you’re going. Think about 
the people you’re serving and 
what they deserve and whether 
or not you want to partially 
deliver. Don’t make the same 
mistakes I did; be deliberate in 
your presence and treat everyone 
with the same respect you wish 
to be treated with.

A viral and satirical Instagram 

account, @barbiesavior, really 
drives the point home. Complete 
with captions like: “Just taking 
a #slumfie amidst this dire 
poverty and need. Feeling so 
#blessed and #thankful,” Barbie 
Savior highlights the issues we 
can get caught up in when we 
place posting over people.

I 

want to thank Senate 
Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell. 
Not 
for 

his public service record or 
anything like that; 
I am not a fan of 
him 
and 
do 
not 

support any of his 
political 
beliefs. 

No, I want to thank 
him for accidentally 
giving 
Democrats, 

feminists and anyone 
else who does not 
agree with Trump’s 
appointments 
or 

actions 
their 
next 

rallying cry.

By now, I’m sure everyone 

has seen the instantly iconic 
phrase 
“Nevertheless, 
She 

Persisted” 
or 
#LetLizSpeak 

on Twitter or Instagram. On 
Tuesday night, during a Senate 
debate on the nomination of 
Jeff 
Sessions, 
Democratic 

Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren 

(Mass.) read a 1986 letter 
written by Coretta Scott King 
in which King argued against 
confirming Sessions for a 
federal judgeship. But, Sen. 
McConnell interrupted her by 
citing a rule, one that is rarely 
used, meant to keep a certain 
level of civility in the Senate.

I’m not surprised that he 

tried to quiet his opponent. I 
would expect that from any 
politician, 
especially 
one 

who refused to hold hearings 
to fill the vacant seat left by 
Antonin Scalia, former U.S. 
Supreme Court justice. But 
I wonder what he thought 
would happen when he tried 
to shut up one of the most 
vocal Democratic voices in the 
country. Did he really think 
that a woman who exchanged 
blows with Donald Trump on 
Twitter and joined protesters 
in a Boston airport following 
Trump’s travel ban would 
stop speaking?

McConnell 
should 
have 

realized that any attempt to 
silence her would have the 
opposite effect. Sen. Warren 
is not someone who will sit 
quietly in the background 

if you tell her to. She was 
barred 
from 
speaking 
on 

the Senate floor, so she said 
what she needed to outside 

of the Senate and 
broadcasted it to 
millions of people. 
Whether or not you 
warn her against 
doing 
something, 

she will do what she 
feels needs to be 
done. If anything, 
attempts made to 
silence her, like the 
one 
on 
Tuesday, 

will just make more 

people listen to her and make 
her message more potent.

I hate the fact that attempts 

to 
silence 
progressive 

female politicians continue 
to happen, but I love what 
follows. 
When 
Trump 
or 

McConnell 
try 
to 
dismiss 

their opponents, the result 
is never what they intended. 
With Trump, it was “Nasty 
Woman”; 
with 
McConnell 

it 
is 
“Nevertheless, 
She 

Persisted.” 
In 
both 
cases, 

these 
statements 
were 

reclaimed and used to band 
women together. They gave 
us great memes and slogans 
for shirts, but they also gave 
many women something they 
could connect to. This shows 
that there are people, masses 
of people, who oppose the 
limits Trump attempts to 
set on freedom and who will 
support each other in the 
fight against him.

Sen. Warren, and other 

senators 
fighting 
against 

Trump, give me hope that he 
will not just stomp on and 
tear down what people have 
worked hard to achieve. I 
need this reassurance.

For the past few months, 

national political news has 
seemed like a constant stream 
of disappointments. Watching 
Trump 
be 
inaugurated 
as 

president, hearing the news 
of 
the 
confirmations 
of 

Betsy DeVos as secretary of 
education and Jeff Sessions 
as attorney general and seeing 

the anger and frustration of 
my friends leaves me worried. 
The people who are coming to 
power have records showing 
that they are unfit for these 
jobs and that they do not have 
everyone’s best interest in 
mind. They want to bring the 
old rules of the game back; 
the ones that say if you’re not 
rich, white and male, you may 
as well count yourself out and 
watch while the boys play.

Seeing 
this 
political 

shift 
is 
discouraging, 
but 

this shift has forced people 
out 
of 
complacency. 
It 

has encouraged people to 
take a more active role in 
government; this is obvious 
by the amount of protesters 
at the Women’s March and 
even in late-night shows. It 
brings attention to the voices 
of 
minorities 
and 
other 

marginalized groups because 
Trump will affect everyone. 
Hopefully, this activism and 
inclusion will continue. We 
need to keep this attitude 
and 
sustain 
this 
energy; 

we cannot allow the events 
Trump has orchestrated to 
become the norm. We need 
to stay vigilant, not just 
right now but always, to 
ensure that the government 
is filled with people like 
Elizabeth Warren, who does 
not just advocate for the rich 
and ignore the concerns of 
minorities like Betsy DeVos 
or Jeff Sessions do. 

Warren’s actions, those of 

other senators speaking out 
against Trump’s nominations 
and actions and the protests 
that 
followed 
Trump’s 

election win and travel ban 
show that no one is going to 
quietly take their seat. People 
will speak whether Trump 
or Sen. McConnell want to 
hear it or not. Any attempt to 
silence us will only make us 
louder. If you try to stop us or 
to warn us, nevertheless, we 
will persist.

L

ast 
Tuesday, 
racist 

emails were sent to the 
University of Michigan 

computer 
science 
and 

engineering email list. Three 
days later, Students4Justice 
organized 
an 
emergency 

protest and sit-in to denounce 
white supremacy, racism and 
bigotry and to call for action by 
the University administration 
to create a more inclusive 
environment on campus.

As the protest commenced 

last Thursday on the Diag, I sat 
in the Michigan Union’s quiet 
Reading Room, unaware that 
the organizers were planning 
the sit-in and protest in the 
same building. By afternoon 
the protesters could be heard 
marching down State Street, 
passionately 
chanting, 
“If 

you’re with us, join us!” and 
ascending into the Union, 
where 
they 
distributed 
a 

letter of demands directed 
to the University president, 
administration and Central 
Student 
Government. 
The 

attendees 
and 
organizers 

protested 
in 
the 
Reading 

Room as well, urging those 
studying and quietly working 
to join the protest. But a 
majority of people packed 
their things and left. 

The discomfort I felt when 

the protesters walked into the 
Reading Room and the reaction 
from those who decided to 
leave troubled me. Though I 
decided to join the sit-in, I was 
conflicted. Over the past few 
weeks, I have questioned how 
my anger toward the political 
climate can be channeled to 
effect change.

Ending racism, misogyny 

and xenophobia calls for broad 
support 
and 
participation. 

With Trump as president, 
combating 
discrimination 

and seeking reparations for 
hate speech and crimes will 
be an ongoing struggle. White 
supremacists, 
like 
those 

who sent the racist emails, 
feel emboldened, no doubt, 
by Trump’s success in the 
election. Richard Spencer’s 
“Hail Trump” speech at the 

“alt-right” 
conference 
in 

November is an example of 
this sentiment.

So, the question remains: 

How do we build a broader 
political coalition to resist 
dangerous government actions 
and hateful speech?

Sometimes, forceful protest 

will be necessary. Actions by 
the Trump administration, and 
his extremist supporters, have 
had a threatening impact on 
the lives of minorities, women 
and immigrants. His executive 
orders and cabinet appointees 
threaten to further disempower 
the already oppressed and 
vulnerable. These actions need 
to be opposed with strong, civil 
expressions 
of 
disapproval. 

Jeff Session’s appointment as 
attorney general presents an 
imminent threat to civil rights. 
The executive order banning 
refugees from several Middle 
Eastern and African countries 
was targeted toward Muslims 
and thus was discriminatory. 
Hate speech, like the racist 
emails, 
poses 
a 
threat 
to 

people’s 
lives 
by 
inciting 

violence 
against 
minorities. 

The list goes on. 

Furthermore, protests like 

the one in the Union or like the 
protests carried out in airports 
across the country in response 
to the Muslim ban should 
not wane. It is necessary to 
continue to advocate for the 
people whose lives are affected 
by hateful actions.

In order to continue the 

momentum 
of 
resistance, 

however, 
we 
need 
broader 

coalition 
building: 
The 

organizers needed everyone in 
the Reading Room to join the 
protest.

On campus, we strive to 

promote 
inclusivity. 
The 

initiatives set forth by the 
University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan have created 
programs to teach incoming 
students about diversity and 
political 
correctness 
during 

orientation. With good reason, 
then, we begin our college 
career cautious to approach 
sensitive topics.

But this poses a problem: 

Avoiding a controversial topic 
out of fear of criticism, or 
critically denouncing our peers 
for using potentially offensive 
language, limits discussion; it 
shoves difficult issues aside. 
In our classes we restrain 
ourselves from expressing our 
opinions on difficult issues 
— if we avoid talking about 
race, at least we won’t say 
anything racist. Associating 
ourselves 
with 
like-minded 

people protects us from having 
our 
opinions 
challenged. 

However, 
this 
inhibits 
us 

from 
developing 
a 
deeper 

understanding of the problems 
facing minorities. We need to 
create an environment where 
discussion about controversial 
issues is encouraged.

So, engage in open dialogue. 

Work together to understand 
how 
non-politically 
correct 

language can have harmful 
implications. 
Be 
open 
to 

criticism and be willing to 
point out when assumptions 
about others are biased.

If 
the 
vulnerable 
and 

disempowered 
in 
society 

continue 
to 
be 
threatened 

by actions from the Trump 
administration — and by his 
extremist supporters inciting 
violence 
— 
organizations 

advocating for change will 
need stronger coalitions to 
resist. Being open to speaking 
to people who look, sound and 
think 
differently 
than 
you 

do and reaching out to your 
peers, including the ones who 
are 
apolitical 
or 
generally 

apathetic, 
is 
crucial 
for 

mobilizing a broader base of 
allies over the next four years.

Now is not the time to 

ignore the demands of those 
who feel threatened. And 
it is not the responsibility 
of minorities to teach the 
world why they must chant 
their demands so loudly. By 
working 
together 
we 
can 

build greater understanding 
and unity in the face of 
oppression.

‘Fifty Shades Darker’ is 
disturbing and unsexy

Newest installment of book adaptation fails to arouse excitement

There’s a scene somewhere 

between the sixth and ninth 
hour of “Fifty Shades Darker” 
where a guy pushes Ana 
(Dakota Johnson, “How to Be 
Single”) against 
the wall, corners 
her, refuses to 
let her leave and 
begs her to have 
sex 
with 
him. 

Ana kicks him 
in 
the 
crotch, 

runs 
out 
and 

everyone 
in 
the 
audience 

cheers. Two scenes later, the 
exact same thing happens only 
it’s with Christian Grey (Jamie 
Dornan, “The 9th Life of Louis 
Drax”) instead of a random 
dude. Except this time, she 
doesn’t violently injure him, 
she just goes along with it and 
we’re all super happy because 
he loves her, I guess?

We know all this already, 

though, don’t we? We know 
how messed up and abusive 
this relationship is and how 
much it sucks that Hollywood 
and the world glorifies it. 
And yet, despite going in 
knowing how coercive and 
manipulative Christian Grey 
is, “Fifty Shades Darker” is 
still deeply upsetting.

The film picks up several 

weeks after the first one 
ended. The couple has been 
separated for a while because 
the 
last 
time 
they 
were 

together, Christian beat Ana 
with a belt and she promptly 
ran away. But it’s OK now 
because he’s changed, you see, 
and he’ll totally never do it 

again. So Ana happily reunites 
with Christian, whose favorite 
ways of showing his affection 
are by telling her what to wear, 
eat, who to speak to, what to 
do, how to think, and of course, 
by 
forbidding 
(forbidding!) 

her from going on important 
work trips. But it’s OK, see, 

because he loves 
her and buys her 
beautiful dresses 
and they have 
lots of sex.

There’s 

a 
subplot 

where 
one 
of 

Christian’s 
old 

sex partners stalks him and 
violently threatens Ana, and 
the way he subdues her — the 
sheer power he has over her — 
is maybe the creepiest thing 
about the movie. It leaves one 
thinking that this movie would 
maybe work better as a deeply 
disturbed 
psychological 

thriller, only it still wouldn’t 
be very good. This subplot is 
resolved in the first half of 
the movie, but it’s hard to say 
exactly what happens to fill the 
remaining hour, because the 
movie thuds gracelessly from 
scene to scene. After about 
20 minutes, the characters 
fall into a horribly depressing 
routine: get dressed up, go to 
a fancy party, have sex, fight, 
have sex, sort of talk about the 
cause of the fight but not really 
because there’s another party 
to get to. As you’d imagine, 
this gets old really fast, and, 
as a result, a two-hour movie 
feels like it’s 60 years long.

Even the parts that are 

supposed to be decent are 
miserable. The first “Fifty 
Shades” movie’s soundtrack 

received a lot of attention 
and acclaim, but its sequel’s 
selection 
of 
pop 
songs 

isn’t nearly as strong. The 
soundtrack does the movie 
a 
disservice 
because 
it 

makes the “plot” even more 
predictable. Happy scenes of 
Christian and Ana having sex 
go with pop songs, sad scenes 
go with forgettable scored 
music. It makes the whole 
enterprise feel even more rote 
and familiar than it already 
did.

The one saving grace is 

Dakota Johnson. Most of the 
cast seems like they really, 
really don’t want to be there, 
but Johnson, bless her heart, 
really does try. She has a 
subtle sense of comic timing 
that helps make her character 
far more likeable than she was 
in the first film, and gives her 
that much more agency. With 
Johnson’s help, the movie is 
actually kind of funny, but 
the kind of funny that sort of 
makes you wonder how the 
hell you ended up here and 
why bad things happen to 
good people.

Leaving the theater after 

seeing “Fifty Shades Darker” 
has the viewer feeling like 
a 
slightly 
worse 
person 

than they were before. It’s 
not so much that it’s an 
incompetently made movie, it’s 
more that, for a movie that’s 
marketed to women as a sexy 
night of excitement, it’s such a 
bummer. The issue I take with 
it isn’t just that it’s offensive 
(and it is deeply offensive), 
it’s that it’s boring. And for a 
movie that’s supposed to be 
all about provocation, I can’t 
imagine anything worse.

Romanticizing party culture

Partying is something that will 

always be intrinsic to the college 
experience. For college students, 
a party represents an opportunity 
to be independent, and more 
importantly, it’s an excuse to be 
young, wild and free (yes, I am 
quoting 
that 
Wiz 

Khalifa & Snoop Dogg 
song). But while we 
should embrace certain 
aspects of a fun college 
party, we shouldn’t be 
ignoring the potential 
red flags that idealize 
the 
college 
party 

experience.

With 
the 

widespread 
growth 

of social media and 
advancement 
in 

technology, big party colleges 
have incorporated the “go hard or 
go home” mentality, prompting 
competition with other schools to 
throw large, crazy parties and have 
them go viral in some way. One 
of the most pervasive purveyors 
of this kind of unruly partying 
comes from “I’m Shmacked,” an 
online 
entertainment 
platform 

that has capitalized on the college 
party scene through entertaining, 
albeit provocative and problematic 
videos.

Created by Arya Toufanian 

and Jeffrie Ray, “I’m Shmacked” 
implemented itself as the premier 
platform 
for 
showcasing 
the 

“reality” of college parties when it 
debuted its first video in 2011, taken 
at a Temple University party. After 
their online presence proliferated, 
video crews from “I’m Shmacked” 
continued to visit universities all 
around the United States, where 
they would record the wildest of 
parties, usually held at fraternities, 
and edit them into highly stylized, 
five-minute clips, synced to a 
blaring, frenetic EDM soundtrack.

Now with 130,000+ likes on 

Facebook, 449,000 followers on 
Instagram and 37,000 subscribers 
on YouTube, “I’m Shmacked” 
has 
become 
a 
nationwide 

phenomenon. In order to expand 
its online empire, “I’m Shmacked” 
has developed subaccounts for 
different universities across the 
country, everything from Indiana 

University to USC to even here 
at the University of Michigan. In 
addition to parties, they promote 
everything 
from 
college 
fall 

festivals to spring break trips to 
sorority recruitment. Toufanian 
and Ray have also monetized the 

“I’m Shmacked” brand 
by 
booking 
venues 

near college campuses 
and 
throwing 

insane 
parties. 
“I’m 

Shmacked” 
has 
its 

own merchandise and 
it even spawned a few 
imitator 
platforms, 

including the similarly 
popular TotalFratMove 
and the unabashedly 
explicit Old Row. In 
2014, it was reportedly 

valued at $5 million.

What 
I 
find 
particularly 

dangerous about this platform is 
not just how it normalizes binge 
drinking and objectifies college 
girls, but how it romanticizes party 
culture. “I’m Shmacked” frames 
the culture of college parties as a 
free-for-fall extravaganza, filled 
with 
gorgeous 
girls, 
toxically 

masculine guys and a whole lot of 
alcohol.

Some might argue that one of 

“I’m Shmacked” ’s more beneficial 
quality is its ability to show 
prospective students what college 
parties are like, which can help 
them determine what school’s 
party scene suits them the most 
(note: “A new way to scout colleges” 
is written in their Instagram bio). 
However, I would counter that by 
saying that it promotes a negative, 
misleading and distorted portrait 
of college party life. A prospective 
student might watch an “I’m 
Shmacked” video and think these 
are what college parties are like — 
a place to shotgun beers, chugging 
Four Lokos, watch girls twerk on 
each other and do stupid shit with 
no consequences.

In particular, “I’m Shmacked” 

profits off distributing amateur 
videos sent by college students of 
people binge drinking and heavy 
drinking. However, these videos, 
which are littered on the platform’s 
Instagram account, neglect to 
showcase just how dangerous 

binge drinking can be. According 
to a 2015 article from the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism, 37.9 percent of college 
students 
ages 
18–22 
reported 

binge drinking in the past month 
compared with 32.6 percent of 
other persons of the same age. 
Researchers also estimate that 
each year 1,825 college students 
between the ages of 18 and 24 die 
from alcohol-related unintentional 
injuries, including motor-vehicle 
crashes. “I’m Shmacked” may not 
be directly responsible for these 
deaths, but they are complicit in 
perpetuating and glorifying binge 
drinking as normal and celebratory 
rather than fatal.

As for objectifying women, 

“I’m Shmacked” uses college girls, 
most of whom are white, blonde 
and scantily clad, to promote their 
merchandise, spring break events 
and generally for entertainment.

This is nothing new, of course. 

Objectifying women and binge 
drinking have been portrayed 
in several films and TV shows 
about college, such as “Blue 
Mountain State,” “Animal House,” 
“American Pie,” “Road Trip” and 
“Old School.” But the important 
distinction to make here is that 
because our generation has become 
so 
acclimated 
to 
consuming 

information and content from 
social media, “I’m Shmacked” has 
taken advantage of the virality 
of social media by reinforcing 
the stereotypes of college parties 
through the pictures and videos 
they post.

Most people in our generation 

grew up obsessing over this idea 
that you have to throw the biggest, 
craziest and largest party in order 
to have fun. Parties can be fun, 
and they should be. People should 
feel like they can drink without 
having the compulsion to black 
out. Women should be able to dress 
in whatever they want at parties 
without being perceived through 
the male gaze of Instagram. If the 
kind of partying in “I’m Shmacked” 
videos is the “ideal” fun for college 
students, then maybe there should 
another platform that portrays 
college parties — and college life, 
for that matter — more accurately.

NYFW REVIEW
Taoray stained by Trump

Apparently, Tiffany Trump 

was there.

When I arrived at the venue 

for fashion designer Taoray 
Wang’s Fall Winter 2017 show, 
I knew her work was a favorite 
of Ms. Trump’s. Heck, I’d 
even seen photos of her front 
row at the previous season’s 
production. But when I took 
my seat on Saturday morning, 
I felt entirely certain that the 
President’s daughter would not 
be making her first public debut 
since the Inauguration at such 
an openly liberal function. Few 
paparazzi were stationed in 
the venue. The usual huddled 
pockets of celebrity onlookers 

were nowhere to be found. No 
Trumps today, I assumed, and 
yet Tiffany remained the only 
thing on my mind.

As I watched models parade 

down the runway, all I could 
think about was whether she 
would wear that pantsuit, how 
she felt about jewel-tones, if 
that slit was too high for the 
President’s 
daughter. 
Once 

we hit the oversized tweed 
pieces, I pictured the grown 
woman’s father barring her 
from wearing something so 
“unflattering.” 
I 
imagined 

Donald Trump tweeting a photo 
of the risque lace tops captioned 
“Sad!” Though I would gladly 
wear nearly every look from 
the show’s second half, my 
brain instinctively eyed every 
outfit from a “build the wall” 
perspective.

Wang’s 
color 
choice 

was 
nearly 
flawless, 
her 

craftsmanship 
precise. 
Even 

her fabric choices, from a 
remarkably fine velvet to a 
crumpled 
tweed, 
appeared 

innovative. 
Unfortunately, 

my Trump-infested thoughts 
prevented me from viewing her 
collection in all of its strong-
meets-sexy-woman glory.

I would love to go back to 

that day, to view that show 
through the eyes of someone 
who is not scared for the fate of 
their country. Tiffany Trump’s 
choice of dress may not be the 
difference between war and 
peace, but the world to which 
she belongs is cruel enough 
to dull even the brightest of 
sparkles. Tiffany, I would have 
loved it if your dad wasn’t the 
President.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
Curtis’s A2 homecoming

Ann 
Arbor 
native 
and 

saxophonist 
Caleb 
Curtis 

brought a welcoming party to the 
Kerrytown Concert House this 
past Sunday. Returning this time 
to perform with pianist Marta 
Sanchez, the duo was embraced 
by the Ann Arbor community.

As I sat waiting for the 

performance 
to 
begin, 
talk 

over the latest changes to the 
local middle school and general 
catching-up 
filled 
the 
room. 

Socializing 
was 
a 
primary 

aspect to the atmosphere where 
everyone seemed to know each 
other. Largely community-based, 
the crowd was limited to an older 
generation, setting up a stark 
contrast to many jazz concerts I 
have attended here in Ann Arbor.

The feeling of community 

contributed 
to 
the 
intimate 

setting of the Kerrytown Concert 
House. A hybrid of a living room 
and art gallery, there are two 
main seating sections that stretch 
the lengths of two rooms. The 
piano and performance space are 
set on a platform in the center 
room with both seating sections 
facing the stage. As stated by 

Curtis, the venue provides a very 
“special experience” with “a lot 
of space for people to hear the 
instruments.”

While there may be a significant 

amount of audience space, I found 
that the two different rooms 
provided vastly different listening 
experiences. 
Initially, 
I 
sat 

directly facing Marta Sanchez on 
the piano and Curtis playing from 
the front. The sound was direct 
and the two were in balance, as 
though perfectly set to volumes 
in a recording. From the other 
room, the sound of the saxophone 
was much more striking. The 
complexities of Curtis’s sound 
came out from this vantage point 
while the piano melted into the 
background creating an entirely 
new 
landscape. 
Hearing 
the 

complexities added to the live 
aspect of performance and created 
a more provoking experience.

The Sanchez and Curtis duo 

concert was incredibly well put 
together. Playing from a range 
of jazz standards and original 
compositions of each of the 
musicians, the pieces kept a 
certain 
level 
of 
engagement 

from the audience. As musicians, 
their performance had unity 
and a deliberateness to each 
phrase. Despite being free of 
mistakes 
and 
an 
effortless 

performance, I craved more: more 
communication 
between 
the 

artists and more engagement with 
the audience. The performance 
felt too planned at times, which 
took away from the live aspect I 
am so drawn to. In such a familiar 
setting, I would have hoped for 
more risks and taking advantage 
of the space to have fun.

On stage, Curtis referred to the 

homecoming as a “relief from the 
stress of New York.” This came 
through in the performance; 
Curtis seemed to be taking a deep 
breath and focusing solely on 
playing. It was a familial affair as 
the crowd cheered on Curtis, and 
the duo took a step back from the 
pressures of the New York music 
scene.

As a musician, I realized that 

the technical and musical aspects 
alone are not enough to create 
an extraordinary performance 
— it is authenticity that drives 
excitement into a performance. 
When an audience can witness 
risks being taken and become a 
part of the performer’s musical 
exploration, a profound power 
surfaces. 
The 
perfection 
of 

technique and rhythm are not 
enough; it is the uniqueness 
and individuality of a musician 
that creates an enduring and 
compelling performance.

HELP WANTED

Last Friday, I once again 

found myself in a sea of most-
ly 
bearded, 
20-somethings 

(apparently a common motif in 
my life) at the beautiful Royal 
Oak Music Theatre. This time, 
it was to witness one of emo 
rock’s most talented bands 
Circa Survive. In honor of its 
ten-year anniversary, the band 
performed their second LP On 
Letting Go in full, including 
two b-sides recently put out on 
Bandcamp with all proceeds 
going to the ACLU.

Circa Survive are an astound-

ingly gorgeous band. Their 
music is absorbing, and their 
visual performance keeps up 
toe-to-toe. Last year, Circa did 
an anniversary tour for their 
first record, Juturna. While 
still a beautiful show, Circa 
decided to one-up it and go all 
out with their stage presence 
this time around. Two replicas 
of their iconic woman’s head-
turned-hot-air-balloon 
image 

from the album cover flanked 
each side of the stage, featuring 
mesmerizing projections timed 
to the music. In contrast to last 
year’s show, I found my eyes 
constantly sweeping the stage 

from the fantastical light show 
and energy flowing through 
every member.

A 
caveat 
to 
anniversary 

shows is that there’s no sus-
pense to the setlist — the 
album is the setlist. There’s 
no thinking involved in pac-
ing the set. When an artist has 
such expertly crafted material 
like Circa’s, they really can’t 
be blamed for wanting to con-
tinue playing them through. 
On Letting Go encapsulates 
the inimitability of Circa while 
still remaining an incredibly 
cohesive listen ten years later. 
Even with the addition of the 
heavier b-side tracks, the play-
through felt incredibly satisfy-
ing.

Beyond 
the 
spectacular 

lights and sounds, the band 
members themselves add vol-
umes to the merit of the per-
formance. This was my third 
time seeing frontman Antho-
ny Green in concert, and the 
enigmatic ecstasy in which he 
performs remains radiant. He 
commands the sea of fans with 
ease, hands grasping for him 
as they scream the words back 
in his face, attempting to pull 
off his unmatched growling 
falsetto. His bandmates follow 
suit, moving with the music, 
rarely stagnant. The entirety 
of the stage was as visually 

dynamic as I’ve ever seen at 
the venue — the performance 
demanded absolute attention.

Another prominent feature 

of the show (and anniver-
sary shows in general) is the 
intensity of the crowd. The pit 
moved as one big mass as long-
time fans let themselves go 
(no pun intended) to the music 
they’ve loved for years. United 
in their love, strangers and fans 
sing with each other, throw 
each other in the pit and boost 
each other to crowdsurf in 
their passion. The camaraderie 
amongst the crowd — especial-
ly those within the punk rock 
scene — adds a uniquely beau-
tiful, dynamic element to the 
entire experience.

Circa Survive is a band 

whose beauty, both sonic and 
visual, simply crackles with 
electricity. The complexity of 
their recorded music trans-
lates perfectly into perfor-
mance. Every word and note 
were heard with the utmost 
clarity, and the band’s spar-
kling brilliance shone through 
every aspect of the show. Circa 
proved they know damn well 
how to put on an anniversary 
show for the second year in a 
row, this time outdoing them-
selves and more than satisfy-
ing the fans who have been 
with them since the beginning.

ATLANTIC

NICKELODEON

‘Airbender’ primed for future chaos 

For some, television is an outlet 

for escapism from worldly prob-
lems and personal anxieties. But 
while that may be true for real-
ity TV and other forms of vapid 
entertainment, television should 
be a medium that goes beyond 
just an escape. It should be pro-
active in informing the public 
about how to deal with issues that 
affect everyone.

Recent programs like “Atlan-

ta,” “Insecure,” “Bojack Horse-
man” and “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” 
are such cases that offer both 
subtle and overt commentary 
on today’s most prevalent topics 
— race, sexuality, fame, gender 
and mental illness. But perhaps 
the two programs that feel more 
relevant than ever are the bril-
liant Nickelodeon animated show 
“Avatar: The Last Airbender” and 
its just-as-brilliant spinoff “The 
Legend of Korra.”

While both are currently off 

the air — “The Last Airbender” 
finished with three seasons in 
2008 and “The Legend of Korra” 
wrapped up its four seasons in 
2014 — their critical look at xeno-
phobia, terrorism, social unrest 
and totalitarian populism makes 
for an eerie, albeit timely, fore-
shadowing to today’s milieu. 

In “The Last Airbender,” the 

messianic 
protagonist 
Aang 

spends the entire series learning 
how to “bend” the elements of 
earth, water and fire in order to 
defeat the evil Fire Lord Ozai and 
restore balance to the world. The 

story is a classic powerful-hero-
versus-powerful-villain scenario, 
but “The Last Airbender” offers 
a mix of solace and intelligence 
by humanizing the characters, 
both the good and bad ones. 
Along with its terrific animation, 
intelligent writing, breathtak-
ing action and droll humor, “The 
Last Airbender” is masterful 
in presenting moral dilemmas 
and giving practical solutions to 
those challenges. During the epic 
series finale, Aang, a non-violent 
airbender, is faced with the chal-
lenge of killing the Fire Lord, a 
power-hungry firebender. In the 
end, the writers make an effec-
tive, inspired choice to have Aang 
take away Ozai’s bending instead 
of killing him, which proves to be 
even more poetic in its reflection 
of the show’s recurring conflict 
between corruption and purity. 
Instead of resorting to complete 
destruction of another person, 
Aang shows restraint by taking 
away the only power that the Fire 
Lord possessed using a peaceful 
yet powerful tactic. 

However, even with “The Last 

Airbenders” ’s happy ending, a 
new evil force would inevita-
bly appear again in the show’s 
excellent spinoff, “The Legend of 
Korra.” Set 70 years after Ozai’s 
defeat, “The Legend of Korra” 
tracks the journey of the new 
Avatar, a crafty waterbender 
named Korra, who must learn 
airbending in order to fulfill all 
four elements. In contrast to the 
Fire Lord and an amalgama-
tion of other antagonists in “The 
Last Airbender,” “The Legend 
of Korra” introduced a new vil-
lain in every season, each more 

powerful than the one before. 
Korra first engages in a hard-
fought battle against Amman, an 
anti-bending populist, followed 
by spirit-obsessed waterbender 
Unalaq, 
airbending 
anarchist 

Zaheer and totalitarian earth-
bender Kuvira. After each major 
clash, Korra grapples with the 
fear of being the sole savior of 
the entire world, knowing that 
she’ll be weakened as the forces 
of evil grow stronger. But similar 
to Aang in “The Last Airbender,” 
Korra finds the moral compass 
within her and fights for the 
greater good of humanity with-
out resorting to simply annihilat-
ing the enemy.

Of course, we don’t live in a 

world where people can manipu-
late classical elements through 
kinetic, supernatural abilities. 
But it is still satisfying and almost 
relieving to have shows with a 
remarkable amount of depth like 
“The Last Airbender” and “The 
Legend of Korra.” Given the cur-
rent tense sociopolitical climate, 
television plays an even greater 
role in shaping a viewer’s percep-
tion on the world, as well as offer-
ing consolation and clarity in 
times of confusion and profound 
distress. In an era where “alterna-
tive facts” and “fake news” have 
become embedded into the main-
stream American consciousness, 
truth can often be found in places 
like television shows. So maybe 
next time, instead of mindlessly 
watching an episode of “Keeping 
Up with the Kardashians,” watch 
TV shows that can entertain and 
educate. Otherwise, how else are 
we supposed to make sense of the 
world?

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
‘Winter’s Tale’ at Miller

Every year, the Department of 

Musical Theatre puts on a studio 
production of a straight play: No 
music, no designers and no bud-
get. In comparison to the upscale 
musical performances that come 
before and after this one in the 
department’s season, this show 
is a refreshing and immensely 
impressive change of pace.

This Thursday, the theatre 

department 
will 

be 
presenting 

Shakespeare’s 
“The 
Winter’s 

Tale.” 
Professor 

Malcolm 
Tulip 

will 
be 
direct-

ing, as he does 
each year, along-
side two student 
assistant 
direc-

tors: Senior BFA 
Acting 
Major 

Zoey Bond and 
sophomore 
Act-

ing Major Marty 
McGuire.

“The Winter’s 

Tale” tells the intrigue-filled 
story of King Leontes of Sicily on 
a quest for redemption. As one of 
Shakespeare’s later plays, pub-
lished in 1623, the play is often 
considered one of the author’s 
tragicomedies or late romances. 
Despite a happy ending (gener-
ally speaking), death and the 
fantastically haunting elements 
situate the play evenly between 
his more classical, delineated 
comedies and tragedies.

“The first three acts feel like 

a completely different play, so 

the challenge lies in uniting the 
tragedy/comedy, and making it 
all exist in the same world,” Bond 
said.

Although the play is one of 

Shakespeare’s least popular, it is 
one of Bond’s favorites.

“Each character is strong, lay-

ered, and has a nice arc, providing 
a wonderful treat and challenge 
for actors — especially in an edu-
cational setting,” Bond said, “in 
some ways it is a better, re-devel-
oped version of Othello.” 

However, Marty McGuire, the 

other assistant director, said that 

the major theme of 
the play is transfor-
mation.

“It’s ‘The Win-

ter’s Tale,’ so there 
is the transforma-
tion 
of 
seasons 

happening, there’s 
the transformation 
of time, and most 
importantly, 
the 

transformation 
of 

people,” 
McGuire 

explained. “At the 
center of the play is 
King Leontes, who 
makes some bad 
decisions, and as a 

result he has to transform from 
that in order to be forgiven or in 
this case also move on with his 
life.”

Although the play and the 

entire theatre season was set 
about a year ago, there is an 
unavoidable and eerie echo of 
the show and our current politi-
cal climate –– the fact that “The 
Winter’s Tale” follows the story 
of a rash dictator is an accidental 
irony that the production team 
has not neglected to emphasize.

“The character of Leontes is 

a dictator of sorts who operates 
on the basis of his emotions, and 
makes very rash decisions that 
solely benefit him and how he 
appears to other people, without 
regards to how that might affect 
them,” McGuire said. “So, we 
have changed a couple things in 
order to draw the allusion a bit 
more strongly towards a certain 
political character in our country 
right now.”

With that being said, and apart 

from switching the genders of 
some characters, not much will 
change from this production 
to the original. This is mainly a 
result of the low budget of the 
production.

“The cool thing about hav-

ing no budget is that you don’t 
have the money to really go time 
and place, so the time and place 
becomes androgynous and non-
specific,” McGuire said, “It’s this 
cool design mismatch of just what 
we had to create a very universal 
play with themes that are true to 
all times and places.”

What’s best about these pro-

ductions each year though, is 
not due to the mastery of Shake-
speare, but to the students them-
selves who are given the freedom 
to take the creative lead.

“It’s the perfect conglom-

eration of teamwork in the arts,” 
McGuire said. “I think that mov-
ing forward, as we try to create 
theatre that can relate to all peo-
ple, of political persuasions, gen-
der, we include all people in this 
process in order to allow as many 
voices heard as possible.”

Following the performance on 

Friday, there will be a post-per-
formance discussion moderated 
my director Tulip, also featuring 
members of the cast and crew.

Goaltenders balancing
pressure, performance

There’s no straight path to 

becoming a goaltender — no 
rulebook, no schedule written in 
stone. It’s just a little bit different 
for everyone. 

For 
freshman 
Jack 

LaFontaine, it started during 
a birthday party one day when 
he was six. There was a group 
playing road hockey, and the 
makeshift 
goaltender 
before 

him hadn’t been doing well 
— “He was getting shelled,” 
LaFontaine said — so they put 
him in the net.

It didn’t seem like much at 

the time, but his stint in front 
of the net started a passion for 
hockey that would drive him 
to want to play competitively. 
After two years of badgering his 
dad, LaFontaine finally started 
playing organized hockey. At 12, 
he started to take it seriously, 
working out in the summers and 
playing more and more.

Now, he’s a goaltender for 

Michigan.

LaFontaine — along with 

senior Zach Nagelvoort and 
freshman Hayden Lavigne — 
make up Michigan’s starting 
rotation for goaltender.

Often viewed as a player 

that can make or break a 
game, 
goaltending 
comes 

with 
tremendous 
pressure. 

Goaltenders 
have 
to 
be 

competitive, have to be focused 
and have to be responsive.

They also have to truly want 

to be the person facing the tough 
shots.

“They obviously want to get 

hit with the puck,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “It’s an 
unusual position, but they know 
that there is a reward for that. As 
far as the technical part of goal, 
you have to be a good skater, 

you’ve got to be mentally tough. 
If you give up a bad goal — and 
everyone in the building knows 
it, your teammates know it — it’s 
not like you can take the puck 
and go down and get it back. You 
can’t score a goal; you just have to 
worry about the next shot. It’s a 
mentally demanding position as 
well as a physically demanding 
position.”

Padded up in protective gear, 

goaltenders are faced with the 
ultimate challenge of guarding 
the net generally from five 
opposing players. 

When a team’s offense is at the 

other end of the ice, goaltenders 
are left alone in their defensive 
zone, tracking the puck for 
any potential scoring chances. 
Sometimes, it can be easy to 
forget about the other goaltender 
when the action is at the opposite 
end of the ice.

But sometimes the player 

that’s left all alone in the crease 
can be the one that pulls a team 
together.

“When 
we 
had 
Shawn 

Hunwick, he was our third 
goalie,” Berenson said. “And 
nobody ever expected he would 
play, but when he did play, the 
team played so hard for him 
because they liked him so much. 
He worked so hard and got 
no credit and no opportunity. 
When he finally got to play, they 
couldn’t play hard enough for 
Shawn.”

After replacing the 2009-

10 goaltender, Bryan Hogan, 
due to an injury, Hunwick 
wound up leading his team to 
a CCHA Tournament title and 
made two NCAA Tournament 
appearances.

But even with team support, 

it can be difficult to handle the 
pressure of the position. Many 
often express that a goaltender’s 
job is mostly mental. As the last 

string of defense before a puck 
goes in the net, it’s easy to blame 
goaltenders for goals.

“If I have an office job, and I’m 

working from nine to five, and I 
make six mistakes that day, it’ll 
probably go unnoticed unless I 
bring them up to someone and 
say, ‘Hey, can you help me with 
these?’ ” Nagelvoort said. “If I go 
and play goalie and I make two 
mistakes, and the other team 
only makes one, we lose that 
game.

“It’s 
being 
able 
to 
keep 

yourself mentally strong, and 
knowing that you’re going to 
make mistakes almost every 
night. (NHL goaltender) Henrik 
Lundqvist doesn’t get shutouts 
every game. The best goalies that 
have played the game get scored 
on in probably the majority of 
the games they play. It’s making 
peace with that in your head.”

The 
pressure 
put 
on 

a 
goaltender 
is 
almost 

unparalleled. When a team wins, 
most look to the lead scorer or 
forwards for credit. But when 
a team loses, no matter by how 
much, goaltenders are often left 
to shoulder the burden.

But 
for 
some, 
the 
pros 

outweigh 
the 
cons. 
For 

LaFontaine, it’s what motivated 
him to abandon road hockey for 
the real deal. And it’s what makes 
putting up with the work and the 
pressure so appealing.

“After a win, when everyone 

comes to your crease, they’re 
pouring off the benches and 
they give you a little tap on 
the helmet,” LaFontaine said. 
“It’s nothing big, not like a 
massive hug, it’s just a little tap 
on the helmet and it’s the most 
rewarding feeling in the world. 
When you’re just lying across 
your crossbar and everyone is 
saying, ‘Hey, good job,’ it’s the 
best feeling ever.”

‘M’ responds to poll pressure

Four games are left in the 

No. 
20 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team’s 
regular 

season, and it’s never looked 
better — literally. 

It’s the first time under 

fifth-year coach Kim Barnes 
Arico and just the seventh 
time in school history that 
the Wolverines have won 10 
games in Big Ten play — the 
record stands at 13 conference 
wins in the 1999-2000 season. 
Michigan (10-2 Big Ten, 21-5 
overall) has also clinched a spot 
in both the USA Today Coaches 
Poll and the AP for the fourth 
time under Barnes Arico. 

But the success puts a “target 

on their backs” according to 
the Wolverines, and pushes 
opponents to play their hardest. 

“Everybody is bringing their 

best game to you, every night,” 
Barnes Arico said after a win 
against Iowa on Feb. 5. “So 
it’s incredibly difficult and we 
have some teams that are in the 
bottom of our league, but you go 
on their home court and you do 
life on the road in the Big Ten.

“That’s what happens when 

you’re a good team. People 
start coming for you. And 
now, Michigan is circled on 
everybody’s schedule as a good 
team, let’s knock them off. 
So I think we’re going to face 
everybody’s best game.” 

The Wolverines have won 

six straight games, hold third 
place in the conference and 
are the only team in the Big 
Ten to shoot at least 40 percent 
from deep. The team is ranked 
first nationally in 3-point field 
goal percentage — shooting 
40.8 percent — largely led 
by 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, who ranks third in 
the nation with a 47.3 shooting 
percentage from behind the 
arc. 

Barnes Arico has compared 

Gondrezick to both sophomore 

center 
Hallie 
Thome 
and 

junior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty, linking the athletes 
by their standout freshman 
performances. In some ways, 
though, Barnes Arico thinks 
being a freshman is the easiest 
year, despite the nerves from 
transitioning into college ball. 

Players like Gondrezick — and 

junior guard Jillian Dunston 
— keep the game “loose” and 
others feed off that energy.

By the time players become 

a sophomore or junior, though 
— like Thome or Flaherty — 
opposing teams set up double 
teams to defend, making it 
harder to maneuver around 
the court. This is the situation 
Thome faced Sunday in the 
Wolverines’ 75-66 win against 
Wisconsin.

The first time the Badgers 

came to Crisler Center on Jan. 
1, Thome broke away with 
a 37-point game. Yet, this 
past week, Thome managed 
just 13 points while Flaherty 
dominated 
the 
game 
with 

35. Though Thome was still 
the 
second-highest 
scoring 

Wolverine 
on 
the 
day, 

Wisconsin knew to stop the 
6-foot-5 center.

But what has pushed the 

Wolverines past the adversity 
directed at their top scorers is 
the ability of the team to look 
for assists and to depend on the 
depth of the bench. 

“I think our team has gotten 

to the point where they have 
a great understanding of, ‘If 
we’re going to be a successful 

team, we have to have more 
than one or two people that can 
score,’ ” Barnes Arico said. “We 
also have to have the ability to 
pass the basketball. When you 
have someone like Katelynn 
Flaherty who can score the 
basketball as well as she does 
but (can also lead) our team in 
assists, that’s pretty special.” 

Leading 
the 
team 
in 

assists is senior guard Siera 
Thompson, who has amassed 
136 to date. The senior class is 
small, as it’s comprised of just 
guards Danielle Williams and 
Thompson. And the pressure 
to not only perform, but to also 
recognize their careers’ end, is 
taking its toll. 

“(Thompson), who has been 

tremendous for us for four 
years, for the last few games 
has really struggled to make 
her shots,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She just looks like she presses 
a little bit and I tried to talk 
to her a little bit yesterday on 
our day off, and she said, ‘You 
know, Coach, there’s only (four) 
games left in my career in the 
regular season and I want to 
be at my best and I want to be 
perfect for the team.’ ”

But perfection may not be 

necessary, as the Wolverines 
seem to have the rest of the 
season firmly in check and 
are favored in the rest of their 
matchups against Indiana (7-5, 
17-8), Michigan State (6-6, 16-9), 
Nebraska (1-11, 5-19) and Penn 
State (7-6, 17-8). If Michigan can 
keep afloat, it could be looking at 
its first appearance in the NCAA 
Tournament since 2012-13. 

“The bigger picture is we 

just have to realize we’re being 
successful and keep doing what 
we’re doing,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Keep working extremely 
hard, keep practicing hard, but 
really try to enjoy the moment 
and really try to have some fun 
with it.

“It’s the end of the season, 

the final stretch. Let’s try to 
enjoy it as much as we can.”

ith two distinct 
possibilities for 
the future, the two 

outcomes of the past two weeks 
have been as different as night 
and day wfor the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

In the first seven-day span, 

the Wolverines suffered a 
disheartening eight-point loss 
to Michigan 
State in East 
Lansing, 
and after 
a midweek 
bye, lost to a 
subpar Ohio 
State team 
at Crisler 
Center by 
four.

In both 

of those games, Michigan 
displayed a combination of 
poor shooting from the floor 
and defending in the paint that 
ultimately led to its downfall. 
Those two central problems 
have appeared sparingly at 
various points throughout the 
season, but when they finally 
showed up in full force, the 
Wolverines didn’t have a ready 
response.

At the Breslin Center, 

Spartan forwards Miles 
Bridges and Nick Ward had a 
field day. Matched up against 
redshirt sophomore forward 
DJ Wilson and sophomore 
forward Moritz Wagner, 
respectively, Bridges notched 
a double-double with 15 points 
and 13 rebounds while Ward 
poured in 13 points on perfect 
6-for-6 shooting.

To add insult to injury, 

Michigan State’s defense held 
Michigan to just 33.9 percent 
shooting from the field and 
26.9 percent from beyond the 
arc. While the Wolverines 
attempted to generate an 
offense along the perimeter, 
the Spartans took over in the 
middle and led the points-in-
the-paint battle by 14.

The situation grew dire 

against the Buckeyes, as 
Michigan simply couldn’t 
stop Ohio State down low. 

The Buckeyes outscored the 
Wolverines 26-8 in the paint 
and 19-4 in second-chance 
points, dominating them both 
in the post and on the glass.

Ohio State’s trio of big 

men proved to be physical 
mismatches for Wilson and 
Wagner, who had the tall task 
of shutting down players with 
far more experience in the 
post. Forwards Marc Loving 
and Jae’Sean Tate led the 
way with 17 and 13 points, 
respectively, while center 
Trevor Thompson secured a 
double-double with 13 points 
and 11 rebounds. 

“It is tough,” said Michigan 

coach John Beilein after the 
loss. “Those guys are young 
bucks in there playing for the 
first time, and they are going 
to get overmatched sometimes, 
and they’re going to get better. 

We just gotta wait it out until 
they get there, that they’re not 
sitting next to me, that they 
know how to 
play without 
fouling and 
they know how 
to move their 
feet better.”

Two 

consecutive 
losses to its 
two biggest 
rivals was 
certainly a 
tough pill 
to swallow, 
but their 
implications took a harsher 
toll.

After the disappointing 

week, Michigan dropped 
to 4-6 in the conference — 
firmly in the bottom half of 
the standings — and sat on 

the outside looking in at the 
NCAA Tournament. With their 
postseason hopes on life alert, 

the Wolverines 
would need 
a dramatic 
resurgence to 
put themselves 
back into 
consideration.

Still, the 

upcoming week 
featured a 
rematch against 
Michigan State 
and a trip to 
Bloomington, 
where Michigan 

hadn’t won a game in seven 
years. Two more consecutive 
losses looked like a real 
possibility for the Wolverines, 
and with games against No. 
11 Wisconsin, No. 16 Purdue 
and Northwestern still left 

on the schedule, a sure death 
sentence.

But in the two days between 

the Ohio State and Michigan 
State contests, dusk turned to 
dawn, a new week began and a 
new Michigan emerged.

On Tuesday night, the 

Wolverines blitzed the 
Spartans from the opening 
tip. Shooting a scorching 75 
percent from the floor and 72.7 
percent from beyond the arc in 
the first half, Michigan had a 
55-29 lead at halftime.

“If you say, ‘This is the only 

way we’re going to win,’ and 
you go, ‘We’re going to shoot 
threes all night,’ then all of a 
sudden you can get empty real 
quick,” Beilein said. “We are 
a good shooting team. That’s 
never been the big adjustment 
we’ve had to make.”

While Bridges and Ward 

still repeated their totals of 
15 and 13 points, respectively, 
the Wolverines matched 
Michigan State with 34 points 
in the paint. Instead of being 
overmatched physically, 
Michigan overmatched the 
Spartans in terms of energy.

Forcing 21 turnovers and 

scoring 30 points off them, the 
Wolverines wreaked havoc all 
game long, eventually blowing 
out Michigan State by nearly 
30 points.

Though the hot shooting 

didn’t travel with them to 
Assembly Hall, that persistent 
energy did. On Sunday, 
Michigan forced another 15 
turnovers against Indiana 
and scored 20 points off them 
en route to claiming another 
double-digit victory.

Wilson and Wagner proved 

to be bright spots rather than 
blind spots, turning it around 
on the defensive end. The duo 
acted as a thorn in the side of 
Hoosier center Thomas Bryant, 
limiting him to just eight 
points in the contest. They 
came up big on offense as well, 
as Wilson scored 13 points 
and Wagner notched a double-
double with 11 points and 10 
rebounds.

Two decisive wins was 

clearly a dose of medicine, but 
their ramifications provide 
stronger relief.

The Wolverines pulled 

themselves up to 6-6 in the 
conference — the final spot 
in the top half — and now 
sit as a projected 11-seed 
in the NCAA Tournament 
according to ESPN’s most 
recent Bracketology report. 
While there is still much work 
to be done, Michigan is still 
breathing.

With six games left in their 

Big Ten season, the question 
remains: Will the Wolverines 
stay in the light of day or revert 
back to the darkness of night?

Adcock reflects on current minor league career

Brett Adcock may no longer 

don the maize and blue, but he’s 
still a Wolverine. 

Following 
an 
impressive 

three-year career at Michigan, 
the Houston Astros selected the 
6-foot left-hander in the fourth 
round of the 2016 MLB Draft. 
He was the 127th overall pick 
out of 1,215 draftees, and now 
plays for the Houston’s Single-A 
farm 
team 
– 
the 
Tri-City 

ValleyCats. 
Adcock 
finished 

his college tenure with a 24-13 
record – making him the sixth 
most 
winningest 
pitcher 
in 

Wolverine history. In addition 
to his impressive win total, 
Adcock ranks fifth in career 
strikeouts with 256.

Adcock established himself 

as a legitimate major league 
prospect in his junior season, 
when 
he 
struck 
out 
100 

batters in 14 starts and 15 total 
appearances. 
His 
ability 
to 

strike out batters as a lefty – 
Adcock ranked fifth amongst 
left-handed 
pitchers 
in 
the 

NCAA with 11.49 strikeouts 
per nine innings – appealed to 
many major league scouts. The 
interest from the big leagues 
left Adcock with the humbling 
decision of whether to finish out 
his career as a Wolverine, or live 
out the boyish dream of playing 
professional baseball.

“It was my time to take my 

play to the next step,” Adcock 
said. “I just felt like I was ready 
to go onto the next level.”

There is a learning curve 

for any player going from the 
collegiate level to professional 
baseball. 
Adcock 
recognizes 

this difficulty, but credits the 
Michigan coaching staff for 
preparing him for the next level.

“I feel like the (Michigan) 

coaches got me ready,” Adcock 
said. “The coaches definitely 

know what they’re talking about. 
They’re Division I coaches, they 
were 
hired 

in part to get 
college 
guys 

prepared for the 
minor 
leagues 

and the pros. 
They definitely 
did that for me. 
Honestly, I can’t 
thank 
them 

enough.”

In 
fact, 

he 
even 
says 

the 
training 

regimen was more intense in 
college than the minors.

Nevertheless, 
Adcock 
is 

quick to point out that the level 
of play is still much higher 

in 
professional 

baseball 
than 

in college; day-
in 
and 
day-

out 
one 
plays 

against 
a 
team 

of 
exclusively 

the 
very 
best 

collegiate players. 
But 
unlike 
in 

college 
ball, 

where 
there 
is 

a team element, 
he is constantly 

competing 
with 
his 
minor 

league teammates to get a call up 
to the next level and ultimately a 

chance at the big leagues. 

“When you get to minor 

league ball you 
don’t really have 
a team aspect 
anymore,” 
Adcock 
said. 

“Everyone 
is 

trying 
to 
get 

to the top and 
everyone 
is 

trying 
to 
get 

your 
job. 
In 

college, 
it’s 
a 

team 
aspect 

more than an 
individual one. You’re with 
those guys 12 hours a day, five 
to six days a week. We were all 

together doing the same thing, 
pushing each other. I definitely 

miss it, (my advice 
to 
my 
former 

teammates) is to 
enjoy it.”

The 

competitive 
nature of minor 
league 
baseball 

is simply a part 
of 
the 
process 

of 
becoming 
a 

professional. 
Luckily 
for 

Adcock, he has 

a former Wolverine in first 
baseman 
Carmen 
Benedetti 

going through the process with 

him.

The 
two 
are 
not 
only 

teammates on the ValleyCats, 
but friends who – after three 
years playing together – will 
rely on one another both on and 
off the field in 2017, during their 
first full year in the minors.

Adcock saw limited action in 

Single-A summer ball in 2016, 
appearing in just three games 
before tearing his meniscus 
fielding a bunt. In the summer 
between 
his 
freshman 
and 

sophomore years at Michigan, 
Adcock 
suffered 
a 
similar 

injury. Having gone through the 
injury and rehabilitation before 
gives him confidence moving 
forward.

“I had meniscus surgery, I 

had the same kind of injury in 
college,” he said. “So I knew 
what was going to happen and 
how I was going to get through 
it.”

In order for Adcock to rise 

up through the minor league 
ranks, he will have to come back 
strong from the injury and also 
improve his game, as about just 
17 percent of MLB Draft picks 
see any time in the majors, 
according to BaseballAmerica.
com. Adcock knows that to 
succeed at the next level he must 
stay consistent, throw more 
strikes and continue to improve.

Despite 
going 
from 
an 

amateur 
to 
a 
professional, 

which includes earning a salary, 
Adcock notes that his mindset 
hasn’t 
changed. 
While 
it’s 

an added benefit to get paid, 
turning pro was never about 
making money. 

“The potential to get paid 

didn’t play a role (in my decision 
to go pro) because it’s not just 
the money,” he said. “You have 
to love (baseball) and appreciate 
that you’re not sitting at a desk 
nine hours a day. You’re playing 
and having fun doing something 
you love.”

T

his season of New 
York Fashion Week, 
I was lucky enough 

to 
assist 
the 
production 

team at an anonymous (shh!) 
designer label in a two-
day, get-shit-done conquest 
leading up to their fall winter 
2017 show. Here’s how it went 
down, in real time.

Day Before Show
2:03 p.m.: My room key is 

MIA, my shoes are soaked 
and I just spent an entire 30 
minutes next to Kyle Mooney 
on the train without saying a 
word.

Craziest street style of the 

day has to go to my man, 
Winter Storm Niko. He’s 
wound up in every single 
photo, for better or worse. 
Look out, Vogue.com! I start 
my unpaid job at 3. Hopefully 
no one at the showroom is 
bothered by my discolored 
Nike combat boots.

4:21 p.m.: At Starbucks 

(again) on a break after 
working for an hour — 
grueling. 
The 
showroom 

is incredible, all glitz and 
gilded. Everyone is terribly 
nice. I organized expensive 
underwear for the expensive 
fashion show, took inventory 

of more nice things and 
stripped models of their less 
expensive clothes, stuffing 
their limbs into colorful, 
avant-garde confections. One 
model told me all about the 
laser eye surgery she had in 
Australia. This coffee tastes 
like chorizo. I can’t find my 
water bottle. Sad!

Two of my fellow interns 

just walked in. Have you 
guys seen a blue water bottle? 
No? I’m about to walk into a 
world-class showroom just 
to search for a half-broken 
water bottle. At least they’ll 
know that I mean business. 
I’m already bored here and 
I’m praying I will have some 
incredibly 
time-consuming 

task to go back to. That 
showroom is the bedroom my 
12-year-old self so desperately 
wanted. Come to think of it, 
this life is all my 12-year-old 
self could have asked for. She 
would be so proud.

9:04 p.m.: All right, now it’s 

really over for the day. I run 
around town in search of a 
FedEx, only to find it hidden 
in the basement of a Sheraton 
(a 
Sheraton?), 
down 
the 

street from the showroom. 
I accidentally walk in on the 

designer’s model fittings. I 
helped make the executive 
decision 
of 
what 
pants 

Kylie will wear to the show 
tomorrow. Full disclosure: 
She doesn’t own half of the 
merch 
in 
her 
Instagram 

photos. The designer loan is 
an age-old trick of the trade.

My boss seems to like me, 

and I’m liking her more and 
more by the minute — if 
corporate love really does 
exist, I think I’ve found it. On 
my way out for the night, she 
gave me a shirt to wear to the 
show tomorrow: A politically 
charged plain white tee, 
listing the phone numbers of 
every state’s Congressional 
representatives. Tell me again 
how “frivolous” fashion is, 
Jake Tapper. Tell me again.

Show Day
9:54 p.m.: I’ve been working 

since 10 a.m. Can’t talk. Too 
much. After-party in a few.

The Morning After
9:38 a.m.: I’m feeling so 

many things — my legs are 
jelly and my stomach is 
growling. I’m proud and 
scared for the team all at 
once. Speaking only in terms 
of the 20-minute span in 
which models paraded the 

runway, 
everything 
was 

perfect. Beautiful, kitschy 
pieces that hugged the body 
like a supermodel’s second 
skin.

Logistically, though, last 

night was a textbook example 
of how one powerful person 
can foil an entire company’s 
expertly-planned production. 
I won’t go into detail, but 
imagine a GSI stepping into 
your 
semester-long 
group 

project only to swap out its 
most reliable members in 
favor of his or her friends. 
That would never happen 
(read: Leaders and the Best), 
but you get the picture.

Last night taught me that 

what’s out of my control may 
suck, but that it will never 
take away from what is in 
my hands. Those seat cards 
I made? Mad awesome — 
Arial bold has never looked 
better. Gossip session with 
Fern Mallis? She’ll probably 
remember my name for 
three whole days.

In 
all 
seriousness, 

I’m so proud of what I 
accomplished alongside the 
rest of my team. Their free 
Moët at the after-party was 
well, well deserved.

Wednesday, February 15, 2017 // The Statement 

BY ASHLEY TJHUNG, MANAGING MICHIGAN IN COLOR EDITOR

ILLUSTRATION BY OLIVIA STILLMAN

A

t Michigan in Color, we pride ourselves on 
being a section by and for people of color, 
dedicating ourselves to producing inclusive 

content from all marginalized identities. Recently, in 
collaboration with The Statement, we published an 
article with contributions from several student leaders 
on campus. In the process, we accidentally published 
a contributor’s assigned birth name instead of her 
current name, Vidhya Aravind.

Unfortunately, I, in my role as co-managing editor, 

made a mistake. In doing so, I caused undeniable harm 
to her individually, in addition to the trans community 
at large.

A person’s chosen name is an important part of their 

identity and self. In assuming that Vidhya would keep 
her last name (which she did not), I unfairly took away 
that power by overlooking the complexity of names, 
and ignoring her Indian cultural heritage.

It would be false to say that my privilege as a 

cisgender woman did not play a role in this. When 
transcribing Vidhya’s interview, I realized she had not 
provided her last name. It crossed my mind if I should 
ask what last name she wanted used, but in the chaos 
of production, I let myself to think “good enough.” I 
wrote the last name used in her uniqname rather than 
asking her, like I should have.

That was both damaging and dangerous. Cis people 

often use dead names or improper pronouns when 
speaking with or about trans folx, creating discomfort 
and sometimes harm to the person’s mental health. 
Furthermore, news outlets often use dead names 
or improper pronouns for trans folx. High-profile 
examples of this include reporters continuing to use 
Caitlyn Jenner’s assigned birth name, rather than the 
name she chose for herself.

The media has a prominent voice in the issue, and 

with power comes responsibility. Using the birth 

names of trans folx in such a public sphere not only 
causes damage to their person, but can also put them in 
danger. Having information like birth-names publicly 
disclosed puts trans folx at a greater risk of being 
publicly outed or harassed.

On a legal level, trans folx face high levels of 

institutional discrimination, particularly in their 
attempts to change their names. Even when courts 
approve of such changes, administrative processes to 
have their name present on all forms of legal documents 
are both difficult and burdensome.

Besides names, trans folx often have little legal 

protection when it comes to workplace discrimination, 
or are forced to use facilities of their gender assigned 
at birth, rather than the one they identify with. This 
includes anything from bathrooms to prison cells.

After my mistake, I sat down with Vidhya to discuss 

what needed to happen next. She explained her careful 
process in choosing her name — the cultural reason for 
claiming a new last name, and the ways she and those 
close to her have been processing and reacting to seeing 
her birth name in print. During this conversation, I 
realized how little I knew about the issues, or even the 
jargon surrounding trans folx.

When researching for this article, I became 

frustrated with the lack of coverage on trans issues. 
While organizations such as the Human Rights 
Campaign and GLAAD, formerly the Gay and Lesbian 
Alliance Against Discrimination, attempt to educate 
and advocate for LGBTQ issues, few of the major news 
networks extensively cover everyday discrimination 
trans 
folx 
face. 
Coverage 
of 
discriminatory 

bathroom laws is plentiful, but information on trans 
discrimination in the workplace or the lack of trans 
representation in television and film are only available 
on advocacy sites and blogs.

As a member of a news outlet, I recognize I am 

part of the larger issue of misrepresenting trans 
folx and the issues they face. Beyond the individual 
mistakes behind misusing pronouns or birth names, 
we also need to do a better job of covering trans issues. 
According to a 2013 study by the National Coalition of 
Anti-Violence Programs, 72 percent of hate homicides 
violence crimes were against trans women, yet I find 
coverage of such violence minimal.

The media claims to take a neutral stance when 

relaying news to the public. However, not educating 
ourselves on the ways privilege can manifest itself in 
our work can reinforce dominant narratives of silencing 
and erasure of the trans community. Privilege is the 
ability to ignore aspects of violence or discrimination 
against trans individuals.

Some might argue that making an effort to cover 

specific situations of marginalized communities is 
working on a slant, but, in my opinion, not making 
more of an effort to cover these injustices is also 
showing bias. These issues are important to everyone 
— not just the trans community — and are necessary to 
fully understand the society we live in.

We 
must 
be 
respectful 
of 
marginalized 

communities, vigilant in accurately representing 
them and their experiences and work to create 
space for communities to represent themselves. 
The media has a duty to offer platforms to those 
facing discrimination and, for trans folx, we are 
consistently failing.

In context with society as a whole, we need to do 

better when it comes to being social justice advocates 
and allies to the trans community. My actions are 
just one in a stream of micro- and macro-aggressions 
Vidhya will face today. We must take it upon ourselves 
to continue our education, to acknowledge our own 
privileges and most of all, to understand when we 
cause harm and work to rectify it.

Changing trends in admissions
The Numbers Game

L

ocated in a predominantly middle-class 

Detroit suburb within a 20-minute drive 

of Ann Arbor, Plymouth-Canton Com-

munity School’s graduating class submits on aver-

age 300 applications to the University of Michigan 

each year. About one-third are usually admitted and 

choose to matriculate, according to Renee Eley, a 

high-school guidance counselor in the district.

As an adviser to many students applying to the 

University over the years, Eley said there has been 

a noticeable trend toward higher competition in 

admissions.

“It slowly keeps getting tougher,” Eley said.

Eley said she has noticed an increasingly com-

petitive admissions process turning away students 

whom she would describe as otherwise qualified, 

reflecting the increased selectivity of the application 

process.

“Last year I had a student who had a 3.9 (GPA), 

and she was accepted at NYU and some other highly 

competitive schools, but then she was deferred at 

Michigan, so she ended up attending Michigan 

State,” Eley said. “There’s no reason she shouldn’t 

have been at Michigan, and that’s where we get con-

fused, because we can’t really get straight answers.”

In the 2009-2010 admissions cycle, the accep-

tance rate to the University of Michigan for all 

applicants hovered just under 50 percent. In the 

2015-2016 cycle the acceptance rate was 29 percent. 

This shift has largely been credited to the imple-

mentation of the Common Application — an online 

college admission application that streamlines the 

application process to more than 600 colleges — five 

years ago, expanding the applicant pool.

Last October, the University released the latest 

enrollment figures for the freshman class of 2016-

2017. The data showed a significant increase in socio-

economic diversity and the number of high schools 

represented at the University, though admissions 

officers at the University are need-blind.

At the same time, the report showed some dis-

couraging trends for Michigan residents looking to 

attend the University.

From 2012 to 2016, the number of in-state stu-

dents in the freshman class decreased by four per-

cent, while the number of incoming out-of-state 

freshmen increased by 25 percent. Simply put, as the 

University expands its class sizes each year, out-of-

student applicants are the primary beneficiaries.

Over the course of the last two admissions cycles, 

the number of out-of-state students who matriculat-

ed has seen an upward trend, largely at the expense 

of Michigan residents.

Forty-eight-point-four percent of the 2016-2017 

freshman class represents out-of-state students, as 

compared to 46.5 percent in 2015 — an increase of 

1.9 percent. Over these two admissions cycles, the in-

state student enrollment dropped by 254 students, 

leaving the percentage of in-state students of the 

entire student body at 51.6 percent.

While Michigan residents, in general, have 

experienced greater competition in the admissions 

process, the University has implemented several 

programs to make itself more accessible to both in-

state and out-of-state students from low- and mid-

dle-class families.

For in-state students the University has invested 

heavily in two programs, the HAIL scholarship and 

Wolverine Pathways, which seek to improve the 

socioeconomic diversity of incoming classes.

According to Kedra Ishop, the University vice 

provost for enrollment management, the HAIL 

scholarship encourages the enrollment of students 

of low socioeconomic backgrounds throughout the 

state of Michigan by providing them with additional 

financial aid.

In 2016, the HAIL scholarship’s pilot year, the 

University enrolled 262 students as part of the pro-

gram.

According to an October interview with Univer-

sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald, HAIL also serves as 

a way of ensuring that traditionally underrepresent-

ed minority students who come from lower-income 

families in Michigan have increased access to the 

University without violating Proposal 2 — a court 

ruling that effectively eliminated affirmative action 

policies at state colleges in Michigan.

“The first year of our HAIL scholarship experi-

ment was very successful,” Fitzgerald said. “We 

brought in 262 HAIL scholars from all around 

Michigan. Now, this effort primarily targets socio-

economic diversity because that’s what the state law 

allows us to do.”

Another program implemented by the Univer-

sity to make itself more accessible to students of low 

socioeconomic backgrounds is Wolverine Pathways, 

a mentorship program piloted in 2015, for middle 

and high schoolers in Ypsilanti and Southfield, Mich. 

— two cities with significant populations of low- and 

middle-income families — that provides students 

with free tuition upon their successful completion in 

the program.

And according to Ishop, the University has been 

largely successful on this front. She noted that the 

number of Michigan high schools that sent students 

to the University increased in the most recent admis-

sions cycle.

The push to improve socioeconomic diversity at 

the University has not just been limited to in-state 

students. For low- and middle-income students 

from out of state in recent years, the University has 

become more financially accessible by the increase 

in freshmen participating in the federal Pell Grants 

program.

The number of students receiving Pell Grants 

— federal grants issued to low-income students — 

increased to 17 percent, up from 15.3 percent in 2015, 

and the number of first-generation students spiked 

by 5.7 percentage points.

According to Fitzgerald this increase in out-

of-state enrollment is partially explained by Uni-

versity efforts to boost the geographic diversity of 

each freshman class. Fitzgerald also noted the Uni-

versity’s increase in financial aid packages to such 

students has allowed the institution to attract more 

out-of-state students that don’t come from upper-

middle-class and wealthy families.

“We’ve grown a little bit in non-Michigan stu-

dents … to diversify the student body,” Fitzgerald 

said in October. “We’re looking at students of all 

socioeconomic statuses around the country.”

The trend toward greater out-of-state student 

enrollment at the University has not been without 

pushback among Michiganders. In the most recent 

election cycle, Carl Meyers — a Dearborn financial 

adviser and Republican — ran for University regent 

on a platform that focused on increasing in-state 

enrollment.

“The University pushes the message that they are 

a world-class University and we have an obligation 

to take kids from around the country and the world 

— and that’s great,” Meyers said. “However, try and 

say that to a kid from the city of Detroit, Canton or 

Traverse City that gets the rejection letter that says, 

‘We’re sorry, it was a competitive year and we wish 

you well on your academic endeavors.’ Their life is 

going to change. And because that out-of-state stu-

dent took their spot, their life has changed.”

*****

For the 2010-2011 admissions cycle, the Uni-

versity became the first flagship public university 

outside of the East Coast to switch to the Common 

Application, joining the ranks of lofty names such 

as the University of Pennsylvania, the University of 

Virginia, Dartmouth College, Northwestern Univer-

sity and Harvard University.

In effect, the Common Application made apply-

ing to the University a quicker and more convenient 

process.

As a result of the switch, many out-of-state admis-

sions critics, like Meyers, believe the University has 

become inundated by out-of-state applicants simply 

because it’s easier to apply.

“The Common App has facilitated students to 

‘carpet bomb’ applications to different schools,” 

Meyers said. “When my son was applying to college, 

he had a friend who applied to 30 different schools. 

He was accepted to about 28 of them, and can only 

attend one. So what we’re seeing happen is that the 

Common Application clogs up the admissions sys-

tem.”

The switch intended to help the University com-

pete against other highly ranked private and large 

public schools that also joined the Common Appli-

cation. Ted Spencer, then University associate vice 

provost and executive director of undergraduate 

admissions told the Daily in 2009 that he expected 

an increase in the quantity, credentials and diversity 

of applicants as a result of the switch.

Mary Sue Coleman, who was University president 

at the time, championed the Common Application as 

a means to ease the application process without for-

going holistic review of applicants.

“For me it became a matter of why wouldn’t we 

want to make it easier for students to apply to Michi-

gan?” Coleman told the Daily in 2009.

Indeed, many high-school students outside of 

Michigan based their decision to apply to the Univer-

sity on the new, convenient online form. In the 2010-

2011 admissions cycle, 39,570 applied for admission 

to the 2011 freshman class, an increase by 25 percent 

over the past year, with most of the growth in appli-

cants coming from out-of-state.

Julia Wiener, who was a high school senior from 

New York in 2011, told the Daily the Common Appli-

cation likely played a role in increasing the out-of-

state applicant pool. Wiener herself was accepted to 

the University.

“A lot of my friends applied to lots of different 

schools, and I think the Common App played a huge 

part in them applying (to the University of Michi-

gan),” Wiener said.

In a 2011 interview, then-University provost Phil-

ip Hanlon said he expected the number of applicants 

to be larger, but also less invested in the attending the 

University. He added that deferrals for early action 

also increased in response to the larger applicant 

pool.

“(This year’s extra applicants) aren’t, perhaps, as 

committed to (the University),” Hanlon said. “You 

always expect that when an application process gets 

harder, it’s more committed people who apply.”

The applicant pool continued to grow each year 

following 2010, with 55,500 applications submitted 

for the class of 2020. This represents a 85 percent 

increase from pre-common app levels.

In the 2015-2016 application cycle, 10,959 applica-

tions were submitted by in-state students, who had 

an acceptance rate of 42.4 percent. 44,541 applica-

tions were submitted by students from other states 

or countries, and these were accepted at a rate of 24.5 

percent.

With a more unpredictable applicant pool, admis-

sions officials found it difficult to control yield rates 

— the percentage of those offered admission who 

ultimately matriculate to the University — and fresh-

man class sizes regularly exceeded their guideline of 

approximately 6,000 students. In 2014, the Univer-

sity hired Kedra Ishop, a veteran admissions official 

from the University of Texas, to help curb over-

enrollment.

The class of 2019 was cut to 6,071, but the fol-

lowing year’s freshman class increased to 6,689; the 

largest incoming class in University history. In sum-

mer of 2016, Fitzgerald told the Daily that the new 

growth in enrollment was a deliberate decision in 

response to the growing number of applications.

“The number of applications continue to go up 

… and the University wanted to legitimately look at 

things carefully and say, ‘could we accommodate 

more of these students showing this great interest 

in coming to Michigan?’ ” Fitzgerald said. “Could 

we accommodate them without stretching ourselves 

too thin or at great additional expense? And what 

the University has decided is there is room for some 

growth as long as we can manage it properly and 

know what to expect.”

The number of incoming freshmen increased by 

618 students from 2015 to 2016, while the number of 

incoming out-of-state freshmen increased by 699 in 

the same time.

*****

Amid the backdrop of this out-of-state flock to the 

University over the course of the past decade, one 

thing has remained true: The cost of attending the 

University continues to increase.

According to University-released statistics, out-

of-state tuition and fees for incoming freshman 

during the 1999-2000 academic year were $19,761 

($28,968 adjusted for inflation). Today, an incom-

ing freshman from out-of-state can expect to pay 

$45,410 in tuition and fees — not including housing 

and other academic expenses.

Over the same period of time, the cost of tuition 

and fees for in-state residents also increased.

During the 1999-2000 academic year, an incom-

ing freshman from the state of Michigan could 

expect to pay $6,338 in tuition and fees ($9,291 

adjusted for inflation). In-state freshmen coming 

to the University last year were expected to spend 

$14,074 — an increase of about 51 percent over the 

past 15 years compared to the almost 57 percent 

increase for out-of-state freshmen.

This financial incentive to admit more out-of-

state students is part of the reason Meyers believes 

the University has recruited students from other 

states.

“The reason I believe we are here goes back to 

actions by the Board of Regents, going back to the 

1990s,” Meyers said in a recent interview with the 

Daily. “They began admitting more out-of-state stu-

dents to solve their budget deficit — that was their 

safety valve. And their justification is that ‘we’re in 

a worldwide economy and we want to admit more 

students from other places,’ but the fact is they (the 

University) need more out-of-state students to bal-

ance their budget because they weren’t as vigilant as 

they should on the expense side.”

University officials like Fitzgerald, however, 

reject Meyers’ claim that the number of out-of-state 

enrollees was a matter of revenue, instead argu-

ing that international and out-of-state students add 

sought diversity to the class profile.

Admissions to the University have been in flux 

in recent years because of several campus develop-

ments. Ishop said last November in an interview 

major administrative considerations — primarily 

the year-long renovations of dormitories, and past 

instances of over-enrollment — have spurred the 

University to reconsider their admissions strategy.

Now that all scheduled dorm renovations are 

complete, Ishop says the University can continue 

accepting students at the same rate as this year’s 

freshman class, which grew by 618 total students to 

6,689 freshmen. As a result, the admissions depart-

ment is looking to “stabilize” the process for enroll-

ing the freshmen class — or ensure the class size is 

controllable. This includes achieving the right bal-

ance between in-state and out-of-state students.

“From 2014-2015, and from 2015-2016 there has 

been a modest increase in out-of-state enrollees …” 

Ishop said in an interview in November. “Now we 

are in the process of stabilizing the freshmen class 

size, we would like to get to a steady point between 

in-state and out-of-state enrollment.”

Regent Ron Weiser (R) disagreed with Meyer’s 

characterization of admissions trends as well. While 

acknowledging that in-state applicants should 

receive preference from the University, Weiser also 

stressed the importance of geographic diversity, 

insisting that any change in enrollment figures must 

be taken in context with trends in the applicant pool 

at large.

“It’s important we have diversity of where people 

are from as well as income,” Weiser said. “I’d have to 

have a lot more information to come to any conclu-

sions … if you had out-of-state applications of quali-

fied students double, and the in-states down … then 

those numbers aren’t bad.”

W

e park the car in their garage, 

which always smelled of tar 

and gas, and I run toward the 

elevator up to their room. When 

the elevator opens to their hallway, I sprint down 

to the end, all giddy and showered, dressed up for 

Friday night. I could immediately smell chicken 

and Bubbie’s perfume.

The door opens and Bubbie gives me a big hug 

and a wet kiss on my cheek that I wipe off in feigned 

disgust. I make my way into the living room to see 

Yashie on the couch, reading the newspaper and 

drinking Scotch. I give him a big hug, taking in a 

whiff of his Old Spice cologne. My father greets 

Yashie with a friendly “How ya doing, Arthur?” 

while my mom, sister and aunt help Bubbie in the 

kitchen. I chomp on some hors d’oeuvres.

After we light the Shabbat candles, Yashie 

takes out his prayer book and mumbles the 

blessing over wine — his eyes sharp with 

concentration and his Brooklyn accent thicker 

than ever. Then, I do the honor of blessing my 

mother’s savory challah, sensing my family’s 

anxiety as I cut the bread with my young, stubby 

hands. We feast and converse about our weekly 

highs and lows until our eyes grow sleepy and 

our stomachs bloat.

Bubbie and Yashie were the names I called 

my maternal grandparents. The Yiddish term for 

“grandmother” is spelled “Bubbe,” but the fact 

that my family spelled it with an “I” somehow 

made it more special. As for Yashie, the term was 

made up by my sister, who couldn’t pronounce 

“zayde” — the traditional Yiddish term for 

grandfather — as a kid, so Yashie stuck.

Growing up, Bubbie and Yashie were an 

integral part of my life. In the late 1990s, they 

moved from the retirement paradise of Florida 

to a comfortable apartment in Los Angeles, 

situated a few blocks from my elementary and 

middle school. Almost every week on Friday 

night, my family and I would gather for Shabbat 

dinner at their place. It was undoubtedly the 

best part of my week, not only because I got to 

see Bubbie and Yashie, but because their home 

was always a place for joy and comfort.

During the eighth grade, I frequently walked 

to their apartment after school. Bubbie would 

give me milk and cookies (either Dunkers or 

Oreos), ask about my day and let me do my 

homework in peace. I’d pop into their bedroom 

to say hello to Yashie, who would be sitting in 

his plush, white reclining chair. For what it was 

worth, their presence in my life made me feel 

safe, known and loved.

Bubbie and Yashie instilled invaluable lessons 

during my childhood that would serve me later 

in life. Yashie taught me how to play chess, to 

cover my mouth when I burped and to pick up 

my food with the fork facing up. Bubbie made 

sure I washed my face every night before I went 

to bed and every morning when I woke up, so I 

could maintain my “shayna punim.”

Bubbie and Yashie shared a magnetic 

warmth they carried everywhere they went — at 

birthday parties, bar mitzvah ceremonies and 

other family functions. But while they radiated 

liveliness, their eventual path toward death 

would lead to a period of pain for my family.

The summer before my freshman year of high 

school, I started to notice a change in Bubbie. 

Her skin became unusually pale, she was a tad 

skinnier and she had a caretaker. My mother 

informed me that the liver cancer she survived 

a few years earlier, came back.

That fall, I felt alienated by Bubbie as the 

cancer had swallowed the life out of her. She 

became emaciated and jaundiced, confined to 

the guest bedroom of my aunt’s house where she 

stayed during the final months of her life. For her 

final Hanukkah, she smoked medical marijuana 

to ease the pain. It was the first time in ages I 

saw a glimmer of the old Bubbie, laughing with 

delight in her pink bathrobe.

But even then, I couldn’t enjoy moments like 

that because I knew it would be short-lived. 

After a particularly difficult evening in February 

2012 — the evening I said my final goodbye to 

Bubbie — I experienced my first panic attack.

It was in my bedroom that was re-done as a 

graduation present. Taking in the newness of my 

room and my farewell to Bubbie only minutes 

before, I felt overwhelming fright wash over me 

and I found myself sobbing uncontrollably. I felt 

like the world was caving in on me. Everything 

was changing too quickly. That night, I waited 

in restless agony until my father came into my 

room at two in the morning. Through baited 

breath and tears, my mother informed me of 

Bubbie’s passing on the phone.

For most of my childhood, Yashie suffered 

from a series of physical ailments — first to a 

cane, then a walker and finally a wheelchair. 

As he became immobile, his loquacious 

personality gradually disappeared, rendering 

him monosyllabic and catatonic. After Bubbie’s 

death, Yashie’s health continued to decline, 

forcing my mother and aunt to put him in 

several senior living facilities.

Like Bubbie, I felt alienated by Yashie during 

the final months of his life. I was reluctant to 

visit him at the senior living homes. Instead 

of staying with Yashie during our weekly 

visits, I opted to take long walks around the 

neighborhood to cool off. I couldn’t bear to 

see my mother and aunt weeping as Yashie sat 

motionless in his wheelchair, closing his eyes 

and opening them every other minute.

On his 90th birthday, I mustered up the 

courage to say goodbye — holding his soft, 

purple-stained hands and telling him I loved him 

and that I was sorry I wasn’t there for him when 

I needed to be. And for the first time in a while, 

I saw his mouth move to speak. The words were 

hard to hear and the sound was obscured by the 

oxygen mask glued to Yashie’s face.

A week later, he passed away, my family 

standing over him as he exhaled his last breath. 

I remember a strange mix of relief and disbelief 

wash over me, knowing that I spent the past 

year mourning Bubbie and now had to spend 

another year mourning Yashie — their collective 

presence was officially gone.

There were a lot of things I wish I knew 

about Bubbie and Yashie. I wish I asked about 

what their lives were like growing up in New 

York and what their favorite movies and songs 

were. I wish they saw me graduate high school 

and go on to study at the University of Michigan.

But then again I knew a lot about them. 

Yashie fought as a private in World War II and 

later took classes at Brooklyn College before 

working many jobs. His biggest venture was 

opening up his own business in New York, 

where he manufactured women’s clothing for 

stores like JC Penney. Most people called him by 

his middle name, Seymour, growing up.

Bubbie didn’t have a middle name. She grew 

up in the Bronx, went to Alfred University and 

transferred to New York University. Afterward, 

she became an audiologist for preschoolers 

with hearing loss and later became a para-

professional social worker. Both of their parents 

were Eastern European immigrants. Together, 

they were perfect, beautiful, fashionable and 

charitable. They were my role models.

Sometimes, Bubbie and Yashie appear in my 

dreams. I’m not sure if it’s just my unconscious 

mind fabricating images and memories, but 

I’d like to think that they’re visiting me from 

beyond. I still try to imagine Bubbie’s infectious 

cackle and her delicious cooking. I yearn to hear 

Yashie’s jokes and catchphrases and how they 

made my family laugh hysterically. But most of 

all, I wish I could go back to that apartment and 

relive Shabbat dinner with Bubbie and Yashie, 

together again.

Personal Statement: Alone, Not Lonely

T

he other night, I took myself out to see “La 
La Land” at the Michigan Theater. After 
countless recommendations from friends, I 
knew I had to go. The only showing I could 

fit in my day was at 9:45 p.m. on a Monday night, so natu-
rally it was hard to find a friend willing to tag alone. I 
didn’t think twice because, frankly, I just really wanted 
to see it.

I absolutely love being around people, but sometimes I 

like to do things alone. It doesn’t bother me. When sched-
ules conflict or when I’m the only one of my friends who 
wants to try a new restaurant, I won’t hesitate to take 
myself. Other times, I need a reprieve from the social 
exhaustion that comes with having Twitter, Facebook 
and Instagram accounts.

Being in college is like having a giant sleepover with 

all of my closest friends, but instead of gossiping on air 
mattresses, we’re running around and writing papers 
while applying to jobs. It can be exhausting to have the 
same conversation 10 times a day, lamenting about my 
lack of sleep and abundance of reading assignments. My 
calendar is a quilt of colors, and, yes, sometimes I sched-
ule time to sleep.

Doing things alone alleviates the stress of planning 

and interaction. My thoughts can sort themselves out 
without the pressure of keeping up conversations.

I wasn’t always this way. Freshman year, I felt weird 

doing anything alone on campus. It seemed like every-
one was constantly hanging out with their new friends, 
and I felt pressure to always have someone by my side. It 
was exhausting, but it was the true college experience, 
right? It wasn’t until after I worked in New York City last 
summer that I realized being alone didn’t mean I was 

lonely.

Being from North Carolina, I was thrown into a place 

600 miles from home where I didn’t know a soul. I was 
living with family in New Jersey and commuting two 
hours each way to work. My job ended at 4:30 p.m., and 
the last commuter bus didn’t leave until 9 p.m. — I wasn’t 
going to let those hours go to waste. Every morning I 
stuffed my camera and sneakers in a bag and left work 
with a new destination in mind.

I took myself out to dinner in Little Italy and asked for 

a seat facing the window, so I could watch the parade of 
tourists and businessmen as they ate gelato on the side-
walk. I strolled along the Brooklyn Bridge and called 
home just to say, “Hey, I’m standing on the Brooklyn 
Bridge right now!” I went to the famous Junior’s Cheese-
cake, sat at the counter and read all of the laminated 
newspaper articles hanging on the wall. I listened to my 
favorite podcast as I walked around the lake in Central 
Park.

One day, I was wandering around Chelsea Market and 

decided to stop for what would become the best taco I 
have ever eaten. The chef seemed to pick up on this as I 
stood at the counter savoring every bite. When I looked 
up with a smiling face covered in guacamole, he gener-
ously handed over another taco on the house.

Another day after work, I bought a ticket and rode the 

elevator to the observation deck on the 102nd floor of 
One World Trade Center. The deck had glass windows 
from the floor to ceiling, and exhibits about the history 
of the city. While reading a display, I began talking to 
an employee who was standing nearby. I talked about 
my summer job and pointed to the roof of the building I 
worked in, far below where we were standing.

After some small talk, I learned we were both study-

ing computer science. He originally studied in his home 
country of France, and was now working at the observa-
tion deck while taking night classes toward an American 
degree. After we parted ways, I thought about all of the 
people I pass in the dining hall or in the hallway that 
I never connect with because I’m too distracted by the 
people I’m already with. Being on my own prompted me 
to look for interaction outside of my comfort zone and 
talk to a stranger.

All too often I see friends miss out on going to new 

places or meeting new people because they are too afraid 
to be seen alone in public. When it’s just you and your 
thoughts, it’s hard to ignore the voice in your head point-
ing out that everyone around you is with friends or fam-
ily.

Don’t get me wrong — there is value in shared expe-

riences. But what if sitting alone in a cafe eating the 
same food as the strangers around you was considered 
a shared experience? Even when you’re sitting alone in a 
movie theater, you can hear everyone around you erupt 
into laughter at the punch line, right? Or what about two 
strangers appreciating the same painting in an art muse-
um? Even a bunch of strangers standing 102 stories above 
the street below could be a shared experience.

I’m grateful for my summer in New York City because it 

taught me the difference between being lonely and being 
alone. Ann Arbor isn’t quite as big as the city, but I still love 
to take myself on walks to the Arb or Main Street. I under-
stand the initial strangeness in sitting alone in the row of 
a movie theater all by yourself, surrounded by couples and 
groups of giggling girls. But I’ve promised myself that being 
alone will never hold me back from doing what I want.
