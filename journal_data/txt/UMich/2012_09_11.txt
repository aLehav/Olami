A firetruck reports to the fire at 611 Church St. that started when a deep fryer ignited at Amer's Delicatessen on Monday afternoon.
Fire displaces students

Residents of
611 Church St.
evacuated from
building
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA and
AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporters
The Ann Arbor Fire Depart-
ment responded to a report of
a fire at Amer's Delicatessen

on Church Street at about 4:10
p.m. Monday.
According to witnesses at
the scene, smoke was coming
from the front door of Amer's
and the roof of the apartment
building located above Amer's.
No injuries were reported, and
it is unclear when residents
who live in' the apartment
building will be allowed back
in the building.
Restoration workers on the
scene said there was about 140

gallons of water damage inside
Rick's American Cafe, located
in the same building.
AAFD CaptainJim Budd said
a deep fryer on the first floor of
the restaurant appeared to be
responsible for the fire when
the grease in it ignited. Budd
speculated that the equipment
then malfunctioned, rendering
the fire suppression systems
unable to contain the grease.
A handful of fire trucks -
including one with its ladder

extended to the roof of the
building - and emergency
response vehicles were d the
scene.
Craig Sidelinger, a safety
officer with the AAFD, said the
fire was active when the fire-
fighters arrived at the scene.
LSA junior Remi Forster, a
resident of 611 Church St., said
she initially thought the alarms
were a drill, but was quickly
evacuated from the building.

Like a Champion, a rental com-
pany based in South Bend, Ind.,

expands to Ann Arbor this year.
Founded by Notre Dame
graduates in 2006, Rent Like a
Champion was developed as an
effort to eliminate vacant prop-
erties around the South Bend,
Ind. campus and put them to
good use, according to Mike
Doyle, Rent Like a Champion
CEO. The graduates hoped to
improve their environment by
rehabilitating and renting out
properties to families and stu-
dents who are attending away
athletic games and need a place
to stay.

Since its creation, the website
has becomea resource for Notre
Dame fans looking for a place to
stay on game days.
After initially expanding
to Penn State University in
2011, the company now lists
rental housing for 27 universi-
ties, including the University of
Michigan and Michigan State.
Doyle said Ann Arbor is an
ideal town for his business
because of the University's large,

Ramadan talks Middle East unrest

After eight years
away, Olympic
runner Nick Willis
returns to the U'
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
It's not hard to imagine
returning to campus as a senior
- most of us will be there at
some point in the next three
years - but imagine you're 29,

an Olympic silver medalist and
married.
Welcome to Nick Willis's life.
After an eight-year hiatus
from school, Willis, a New Zea-
land native, decided to come
back to the University.
"After the (London) Olym-
pics, I figured it's time to finally
finish my undergraduate degree
(in) economics," Willis said.
Why such a long wait? Well,
Willis turned professional after
his junior year at Michigan with
the experience of running at the
2004 Athens Olympics under

his belt. He wanted to compete
on the international level, and
then-Michigan track coach Ron
Warhurst, suggested he pursue
his goal.
"When I first came to Michi-
gan, I came with the hope and
expectation to be able to rep-
resent my country, and it was
in agreement with the coaches
to allow me to do that," Willis
said. "(I turned professional)
primarily because of the free-
dom it allowed me for compet-
ing against the best in the world.

In speech, Oxford
prof. is critical of
U.S. role in the
Islamic World
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
For a man banned from the
United States for six years, Tariq
Ramadan drew a big crowd.
On a whirlwind tour of the

United States, Ramadan, a pro-
fessor of Contemporary Islamic
Studies at the University of
Oxford in England and one ofthe
world's pre-eminent scholars in
Middle Eastern affairs, gave a
lecture and answered questions
Monday night at the University's
Law School. Topics focused pri-
marily on the recent unrest in
Egypt and the other countries
involved in the Arab Spring, but
also shifted to critiques of West-
ern democracy and the role of
women in the Islamic world.

Ramadan, a controversial fig-
ure in global politics, was previ-
ously prevented from accepting
a teaching position at Notre
Dame University by the U.S.
State Department in 2004 when
his visa was revoked. The State
Department argued his exclu-
sion was justified by his ideol-
ogy and financial contributions
he made in the 1990s to groups
now linked with Hamas, the
Palestinian terrorist group that
controls the Gaza Strip.

30 years ago this week (Sept.
10,1982):
A federal investigation cleared
the University of any Title IX
sex-bias violations after four inci-
dents of alleged discrimination
were reported within the Univer-
sity's Athletic Department, The
Michigan Daily reported.
One of the reported episodes
of sexism was exposed when
the University's Office of Civil
Rights charged the Athletic
Department with neglecting to
fly women's teams to competitive
sporting events as often as men's
teams.
Though changes were even-
tually made, Virginia Nordby,
director of the University's

Office of Affirmative Action, said
she was still dissatisfied.
"The University would never
admit that it was in violation of
Title IX," Nordby said.
11 years ago this week (Sept.
12,2001):
On the night of Sept. 11, 2001,
an estimated 15,000 members of
the University community gath-
ered in the Diagto honor the vic-
tims of the attacks on the World
Trade Center, the Daily reported.
"By far this was the largest
turnout (the University has) ever
had," said Diane Brown, Depart-
ment of Public Safety spokes-
woman.
While the University can-
celled class in light of the attacks,

the Michigan State University
administration elected to hold
classes as planned.
" ... I am appalled," said Katie
Dirksen, then a junior at MSU.
"Everybody is irate about this."
10 years ago this week (Sept.
13,2002):
Former University basketball
player Chris Webber released a
statement in which he pleaded
not guilty to charges of conspir-
ing to obstruct justice and giving
false testimony before a grand
jury, the Daily reported.
If he was convicted, Webber
could have faced up to five years
in prison and $250,000 in fines
for each count.

RAMADAN
From Page 1
But, because the organizations
were not identified as affiliates of
terrorist groups at the time of his
contributions, Ramadan claims
he was not connected to them.
In January 2010, Secretary of
State Hilary Clinton personally
signed an order lifting the ban
against Ramadan, allowing him
to enter the United States.
His visit, sponsored by the
University's Muslim Student
Association, drew a crowd of
more than 600 students packed
into three rooms. The event was
also streamed online for others to
view.
Ramadan's visit to the United
States, which includes stops in
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C. and Ann Arbor,
is to promote his new book, "The
Arab Awakening: Islam and the
New Middle East." The book
presents his analysis and views
about the Arab Spring, its ramifi-
cations for the West and the peo-
ples of the Middle East.
Ramadan began his speech
by reminding attendees that the
West played a role in support-
ing the authoritarian powers of
the Middle East for generations,
and said the people of the United
States and Europe should criti-
cize their governments for sup-
porting the regimes for so long.
"Our governments in the
United States of America and the
European countries have been
supporting dictators, and sup-
porting a lie," Ramadan said.
Ramadan called on Western-
ers, particularly Western Mus-
lims, to stand up and defend the
nascent reforms in the Middle
East.He spoke atlength about the
discordant conflict between the
Islamist parties and the secular
groups vying for influence while
forming governments in post-
revolution countries.
"Western Muslims are too
much on the defensive in a dis-
cussion, they are apologetic
very often," Ramadan said. "It's
high time now to be much more
involved in the discussion."
The pervasive division
between secularists and Islamist
groups is another major problem
facing the new governments,
Ramadan said. He lambasted

Middle East intellectuals for ced-
ing too much blind authority to
religious leaders.
Still, he said the division
between the two groups prevent-
ed a real discussion of how to face
the economic and social problems
gripping the post-uprising coun-
tries.
"You have less critical think-
ing and more emotional politics,
you are losing democracy for
instance," Ramadan said. "People
are abusing Islamin an emotional
role to attract people, not about
critical thinking."
Ramadan disputed the idea
that the uprisingtook the Westby
surprise, and that governments
had been making contingency
plans years in advance.
"The United States and the
European countries needed
democratization in the region,"
Ramadan said. "Supporting the
dictators was becoming difficult
for a number of reasons."
Ramadan credited the U.S.
State Department and other
Western organizations for help-
ing train Egyptians in social
media tactics prior to the upris-
ing. He stated that some of those
who were trained in the United
States were arrested in the Cairo
airport by the Mubarak govern-
ment when returning to Egypt
before the revolution began.
"Google was also involved in
giving the satellite (access) codes
to demonstrators in Egypt, but
they didn't give them to Syrian
people," Ramadan said. "Why?
At the beginning, remember, the
philosophy from the American
government and the European
governments was to have Bashar
al-Assad reform his regime from
within."
Ramadan also addressed wom-
en's rights, saying the status of
women was more dependent on
their education than what cover-
ings they choose to wear.
"True empowerment is our
education and job market,".
Ramadan said. "When you are
serious about the education of
women and access to the job mar-
ket, this is what you are doing to
empower women, it's not the way
you dress."
LSA senior Amre Metwally,
the night's master of ceremonies,
said the event with Ramadan has
been in the works for almost a
year and that planning around

his schedule was the major chal-
lenge. He added that it was unex-
pected that Ramadan focused
so much on transnational issues
rather than the internal politics
of each country.
"It was a refreshing twist
to hear him talk about Muslim
Americans, European Muslims,
and how, once again this issue
goes beyond nationality, beyond
religion, and affects everyone,"
Metwally said.
Metwally, who said he visited
family in Egypt this summer,
described the situation as rest-
less, with the population becom-
ing disillusioned about how
quickly changes could take effect
after the revolution.
"Regardless of the how people
feel about the Muslim Brother-
hood (Egypt's dominant political
party), people are relieved to see
someone standing up to the mili-
tary," Metwally said.
LSA junior Zeinab Khalil, MSA
president, said she was impressed
that Ramadan downplayed the
role of Islam in the debate about
the Middle East, instead focusing
on civil society.
"For him, because he's studied
this topic so much, it seems trite,"
Khalil said. "Let's move on and
talk about what people are really
worried about, really thinking
about."
Khalil added she was sur-
prised to hear how much Western
involvement played a role in the
Middle Eastern uprisings.
"You can't dismiss the fact that
it was there, but I wonder if he
was over-emphasizing the role
that the West played during this
uprising," Khalil said. "It's some-
thingI want togo lookmore into."
LSA senior Sarah Awad-Farid,
an MSA member, said the focus
on empowering American Mus-
lims was refreshing.
"I was surprised ... that he
would encourage American Mus-
lims to think outside the box,
to say that you are an American
so you have the right to use lan-
guage that you're used to without
apologizing," Awad-Farid said.
"Don't be passive, be involved in
your communities, because once
you're passive and on the defense,
it's negative."
Awad-Farid added that the
focus on women's rights was
heartening, especiallyRamadan's
recognition of the issues that

At event, Behar
encourages
students to think
beyond money
By SAM GRINGLAS
For the Daily
While many students sip
drinks from Starbucks every
night to fuel their studies, a few
hundred students started their
night by listening to a speech by
the company's former president
Monday evening.
Howard Behar, former Star-
bucks Coffee president, spoke
Monday night in Blau Audito-
rins at an event co-sponsored
by University of Michigan Hil-
lel and the Ross School of Busi-
ness. Behar, author of "It's Not
About the Coffee", emphasized
serving others as the core of any
business or career, even in a field
when profit margins often reign
supreme.
Throughout his Starbucks

career, which included helping
the company grow from 28 stores
to an international brand, Behar
said he built a culture rooted in
values, rather than dollars.
"If it's not about the coffee,
what is it a bout? It's about the
people, Behar said. "It doesn't
make any difference what you
choose to do. There's really only
one profession in the world:
that's to be of service to another
human being."
Behar encouraged students to
develop their lives and careers
based on personal values, rather
than a race for corner offices,
promotions or six-figure sala-
ries.
"We forget that what we real-
ly should be chasing is service to
human beings," he said.
As students prepare to enter
the job market, many attend-
ees, including Business gradu-
ate student Matt Jackson, said
they found renewed importance
in seeking a greater purpose in
their careers.
"It was encouraging to hear
such a high level person talk

about values," Jackson said.
After Behar's speech, Busi-
ness senior Todd Siegel, the
event organizer, said he felt
students reacted positively to
Behar's philosophy.
"When you do the right thing,
the rest of it comes with it. That's
an important message," Siegel
said.
Siegel asked Behar to come to
Hillel after hearing him speak
at a conference last November.
When Behar expressed interest
in speaking with the Business
School, Siegel decided to inte-
grate the two groups.
In an interview after his
speech, Behar said he enjoyed
tailoring his speech to college
students.
"It's a wonderful experience
for me ... the fountain of youth
exists on college campuses,"
Behar said. "I get the energy and
the passion of college students. I
want college business students
to at least think a little bit dif-
ferently. You can lead with good
values, caring about people and
you can make money doing it."

Chinese micro-bloggers and
overseas websites have come up
with all kinds of speculation as
to why the current vice presi-

cessful sites just because of the
sheer number of people coming
back," Doyle said.
The site dedicated to Ann
Arbor has seven rental houses
listed. Doyle said there are about
130 houses listed in South Bend,
and he's hoping to expand the
-progranyinAnfl Arbor by adding
20 housesoverthe next few years.
"Once people hear what the
website does they're generally
pretty receptive to it," he said.
"Once people start making a
couple thousand dollars every
football season, they start telling
their friends ... and from there it
really kind of takes care of itself."
Doyle said the tough economy
offers another incentive for own-
ers to consider renting out their
homes.
"This is something that allows
them to make a significant
amount of money," he said. "Peo-
ple are able to pay off their mort-
gages for ayear by renting out for
six weekends ayear."
Though the website collects a
15-percent service fee for rented
houses,-there is no charge to list
onthesite. Ownersdeterminethe

price they want to charge renters
per event and standard check-in
is at 5 p.m. on Friday and check-
out is by noon on Sunday.
Doyle said though the business
is focused on housing football
game attendees, he's open to list-
ing rentals for other occasions as
well.
"A lot of that actually comes
from our homeowners," Doyle
said. "We're definitely willing to
help people put up their places
for weekends in the spring or
over the summer or anything like
that."
Ann Arbor resident Matt Gro-
coff, who owns Michigan's first
net-zero energy home - a facility
that has no annual carbon emis-
sions or energy consumption -
with his wife, began renting to
families this year. Grocoff's house
has been featured in The Atlantic,
USA Today and My Ford Maga-
zine for its ability to produce as
much energy as it uses.
He said the site made him
reevaluate his negative feelings
towards rental sites and the bad
experiences he has confronted in
the past.
"I'm happy that there is a ser-
vice that's not sleazy available,".
Grocoff said. "That's the impres-
sion I always had of these kinds of
services."

Grocoff said he and his wife
were also comforted that the
website takes a safety deposit to
ensure that any possible damage
will be covered.
"It's a great deal for everyone
involved," he said. "It's kind of
fantastic. We actually just added
more games because we're start-
ing to see the kind of people that
rent."
Engineering freshman Chris
Gresehover said he thinks the
website is a good way to make
money, but would be cautious
renting out his home.
"I think that would be a cool
thing to do, but I'd be worried
about the after effects," Grese-
hover said. "But it's a good atmo-
sphere to hang out with your
friends."
Washtenaw Community Col-
lege student Michelle McAnulty
said she wouldn't be nervous
about renting out her home for
football games.
"I wouldlikemeetingnewpeo-
ple and I wouldn't mind doing it,"
McAnulty said.
Fellow WCC student Emilie
Jarret, an Ypsilanti resident, said
she personally would never rent
out her home.
"I just don't like people that
much," Jarret said. "But it's not a
bad idea."

are earned by checking in via
smartphone app or at event site
kiosks, and students can win
rewards at different point lev-
els. Prizes range from athletic
apparel to "over-the-top grand
prizes, like eating lunch with
Athletic Director Dave Bran-
don," according to the app's
description in iTunes.
Thick explained that in order
for students to be eligible for
H.A.I.L.'s prizes, they must cor-
rectly enter their UM ID num-
ber in the app's account profile
section.
She added that the app has
functioned well at volleyball
and field hockey games and men
_and women's soccer matches.
Men's soccer has been the most
popular of the non-revenue
sports thus far, with 178,166 and
130 students checking in at each
of the team's first three home
matches. According to Thick,
these attendance figures are on
par with last year's men's soccer
numbers.
According to Thick, the Ath-
letic Department will have a
better idea as to whether the
H.A.I.L. initiative is improving

attendance numbers at non-rev-
enue sporting events later this
month.
"Everybody knows about
football," Thick said. "But we
want to make sure that (stu-
dents) are aware of all these
other events that they can come
to and the fact that they're free."
Though the program is
designed to increase non-reve-
nue sporting event attendance, a
secondary objective of H.A.I.L.
is to urge students to come
early for the revenue games.
Thick said a full student sec-
tion throughout the duration
of games creates a better atmo-
sphere.
"We want you there when
the game starts," she said. "It
looks bad when there are empty
seats."
Thick said the department
will continue to promote the
H.A.I.L initiative to reach even
more students early in the ath-
letic calendar. The depart-
ment has specifically promoted
H.A.I.L. to major student orga-
nizations on campus, includ-
ing Club and Intramural Sports
teams, Greek Life and the men's
basketball and soccer fan clubs.
While still in its early stages,
the program has helped attract
students to non-revenue sports.

As of Monday morning, LSA
senior Andrew Malmquist was
tied at the top of the H.A.I.L.
leader board with 21 points.
Though he said in seasons
past he has been a frequent
attendee of football, men's bas-
ketball and ice hockey games,
the program has helped encour-
age Malmquist to attend vol-
leyball, field hockey and soccer
matches this season as well.
"I personally had never been
to a soccer game ... I love the
soccer games," Malmquist said.
"They're a ton of fun to go to."
Malmquist said enjoying the
experience and atmosphere of
the events has been the primary
gratification of the program for
him so far, but taking home one
of the major prizes would be an
added bonus.
LSA senior Charlotte Rath,
who has accumulated 15 points,
said she participated because
she wants to attend more events
during her final year at school.
"It was just a goal of mine
since it's my last year here to
see more sporting events," Rath
said, who has already attended
volleyball, field hockey, soccer
and football games this season.
Rath said she also enjoys com-
peting with her friends to see
who can earn the most points.

From Page 1
When you're stuck within the
NCAA calendar, it makes it very
difficult to travel to go to the
races. I reached a certain level
in my competition - I went to
the Olympics as a sophomore -
I thought it was time to move
up to the next level."
Willis' professional career
began in 2005 when he imme-
diately made an impact on the
national scene by breaking New
Zealand's 32-year-old national
record in the 1,500-meter run.
A year later, he won the gold
medal in the race at the Com-
monwealth Games in Mel-
bourne.
The Kiwi's career took an
even bigger step in 2008, where
he took the silver medal in the
1,500-meter run at the Beijing
Olympics in a time of 3:34.16.
Willis said he didn't expect to
race so well in Beijing - his
13th-place finish in Athens put
him under the radar for the
2008 Summer Games - so he
was pleasantly surprised with
the results.
His outstanding finish in
2008 made him one of the
favorites for the 2012 London
Olympics. A few days before the
Opening Ceremony, Willis was
announced as New Zealand's
flag bearer. He said the honor
of leading his country's delega-
tion into the Olympic stadium
matched stepping onto the
podium to receive his medal in
Beijing.
But in the 1,500-meter finals,
Willis took ninth place, which
was a sour way for him to wrap
up his third Olympics, especial-
ly after the multiple opportu-
nities he had to represent New
Zealand, he said.
"I came in as one of the favor-
ites, and I had some incred-
ible experiences," Willis said.
"I got to be the flag bearer for
my country, I got to meet the
queen, but from a performance

"Someone ran through the
building yelling, 'Get out, get
out,"' she said.
Forster added that she saw
an oven in Amer's engulfed
in flames once she was forced
from her apartment.
"It was surreal," she said.
As firefighters climbed to
the roof and entered the build-
ing, student residents of the
complex milled around outside,
alongside concerned passersby
and employees and patrons of
businesses within the building
who anxiously awaited more
information from the AAFD.
Budd said residents will not
be let back in until the fire sys-
tem in the building is reset and
functioning properly. '
Another malfunction to
investigate is an error with
some fire alarms within apart-
ments.
LSA senior Rebecca Noren,
another resident who lives at
611 Church St., said she was in

her apartment when the alarms
began to sound, but it turned
off after approximately 20 to 30
seconds.
"We didn't even know any-
thing was happening until I ran
downstairs and saw smoke in
Amer's," Noren said.
According to Sidelinger, they
are investigating these reports.
"We're looking into that, but
at this point we cannot com-

standpoint, it was extremely
devastating. I didn't perform
the way I'm capable of, so it
was a really, really trying and
challenging time but also one
as something I'll hold on to as a
unique memory."
Though Willis will be 33 by
the time the 2016 Olympics
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, roll
around, he said he still has
plans to continue his career and
hopefully return to the medal
stand.
But for now, his career and
the Olympics are on the back
burner. Willis is simply focus-
ing on finishing his education,
which he said is a "fascinating
experience."
"When I was a student-
athlete here, no matter how
much focus I put in or deter-
mination to be a good student,
I wasn't emotionally connect-
ed with my studies," he said.
"You were really just clocking
in and clocking out of class
and just getting the task done.
Now, with the Olympics over,
I feel for the first time I get to
experience what it's like to be
emotionally connected to be a
proper student. It's quite enjoy-
able, actually."
Willis also ran the @umich-
students Twitter account for
the first week of classes, tweet-
ing about the many activities on
campus and the lesser-known
areas in Ann Arbor he likes to
explore, such as areas around
North Campus.
He also mentioned on Twit-
ter that he likes to participate
in MRun, the University's run-
ning club.
But re-acclimating to school
it hasn't necessarily been as
easy as he'd thought, Willis
said.
"I was so nervous for the
first class," Willis said. "It was
environmental geography, and
I was more nervous waiting 10
minutes before that class than
the whole wait before walking
in the Opening Ceremony with
the flag."
ment," he said.
Residents of the apartment
building said they were waiting
to hear when they would be able
to return to their apartments.
Firefighters advised that in
the event students are unable to
find housing, the American Red
Cross will provide temporary
shelter.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown
said the University provides
aid to students who are victims
of fires or other disasters if the
Division of Student Affairs is
notified, acknowledging that
the Red Cross is often able to
respond to incidents such as
today's fire.
Dan Clark - owner of Dol-
lar Bill Copying, located inside
affected building - said his
store suffered only slight smoke
damage.
He said he spoke to Amer
Bathish, owner of Amer's, and
Bathish had a "let's get this
fixed and move on" attitude.
LSA senior Brett Pere said
he and his roommates at 611
Church St. were able to enter

their apartment later Monday
evening to retrieve some of
their personal belongings, most
notably a case of beer.
"Just the essentials, really,"
Pere joked. "It's still Monday
Night Football."

Reward and restore
Early signs are positive for Detroit schools
fter years of dismal classroom attendance numbers,
the Detroit Public Schools system may be finally reap-
ing the benefits of the city's revitalization efforts. Last
Friday, the Detroit Free Press reported an encouraging upturn
in attendance on the second day of DPS classes. Though these
early reports don't guarantee that the attendance rate will hold
fast, they indicate the success of Detroit's renewed emphasis
on the efficient marketing of public education to parents and

address in honor of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

students alike.
Last Tuesday, DPS reported an attendance
rate of 70 percent on its first day of the aca-
demic year, a significantincrease from 50 per-
cent on the first days in both 2010 and 2011.
On Wednesday, attendance increased to 85
percent, reflecting DPS's successful efforts
to scale back the size of its school system and
to more aggressively showcase its revamped
education program.
In the past, DPS was criticized for its
overemphasis on "Count Day," a statewide
student tally that falls on the first Wednes-
day of October and the second Wednesday
in February. Since the fall count determines
90 percent of the year's state funding to each
school, DPS has often taken the road of least
resistance, drawing students in for one or two
days with gift cards, prize drawings and -
this year - "a free pair of Nikes, courtesy of a
local shoe store."
Since the schools lost about $7 million in
state funds last year due to low attendance on
crucial days, DPS's effort to draw students in
on Count Days is understandable. However,
the way the state determines funding can cre-
ate an incentive to keep students in class for
one or two days a year without retainingthem,
since DPS will receive funding for a student's

presence on Count Day regardless of whether
he or she stays in school year-round.
Fortunately, the early attendance numbers
reported for this school year show DPS is
committed to maintaining consistent student
attendance before and after Count Day. Roy
S. Roberts, Detroit Public Schools emergency
financial manager, confirmed this when he
stressed the importance of "teaching and
learning from day one" in a press release last
Thursday. Roberts continued by asserting,
"If kids aren't in school from the beginning
of the school year then their entire academic
year is affected."
DPS's reformed approach to education
owes its success to a scaled-back size, reno-
vated facilities and, most importantly, an
increased emphasis on faculty-parent inter-
facing - which includes a new automated
calling system that notifies parents whose
children aren't in school. The district's tri-
umph in spite of its recent budget cuts should
be rewarded with restored funding. Parents,
teachers, principals and members of Detroit's
grassroots movements have worked hard to
improve the educational system of their city,
and their efforts should be met with support
from the state government.

Imagine the most terrible feeling

This happens every day to at least
24 people in America because of gun
violence. There are up to 9,000 gun
related homicides in the U.S. every
year, and almost all of those will
result in a phone call, a funeral and
dozens of completely altered lives.

I came to a realization earlier this
summer. About a week before the
movie theater shooting in Aurora,
Col., I was having a conversation
with a coworker about gun violence
in Detroit. Elise, a Detroit resident
with two children, was concerned
with the rash of shootings that had
been taking place at gas stations
and Coney Island restaurants in the
city late at night (she hoped to get
security guards at these locations
to deter crime).sAfter hearing about
Aurora, I was upset to see how asub-
urban shooting had finally reignited
debates about security and guns,
while the ongoing urban violence,
like Elise talked about, was over-
looked. It seemed like just another
instance of race and class determin-
ing an issue's importance.
What troubled me more, however,
was what this debate was actually
about. Rather than a conversation
about how to tackle something that
is clearly a huge problem - whether
we're talking about rare mass shoot-
ers or daily homicides - the debate
was whether or not we should do
anything. That's right, our leaders
were arguing whether or not any
action at all should be taken to alle-
viate gun violence. Considering the
lack of any legislation or executive
action, itseemsthat once again we're
not addressing gun deaths head on.
Gun violence is not inevitable.
People being shot and killed are not
unstoppable occurrences like dis-
eases, viruses or natural disasters.
They can be prevented. We know
this because other developed nations
don't have this problem to the extent
of the U.S. Japan, Great Britain, Can-
ada, Germany - none of them have
problems with gun violence like we
do. Clearly, something can be done

about it. Should we enforce stricter
gun control, as many of these coun-
tries do, or should we come up with
a completely new solution based on
gun rights and security? This is a
necessary discussion that has the
potential to limit people like James
Holmes' all-too-easy access to dan-
gerous weapons.
Aurora should
have sparked
broarder
conversation.
The point is that we have the
political power to have a broader
conversation onthese senselessmur-
ders. It doesn't matter if it's a group
of people being fired at in a Colorado
movie theater or an individual being
shot during a carjacking in Detroit
- no son, daughter, mother, father
or friend ever wants to get that call.
After a mass shooting, people so
often say, "We can never let this hap-
pen again." But within a year, anoth-
er headline tragically appears. I'm
not asking for martial law on guns or
demanding we hire security guards
at every busy public place in Amer-
ica. I'm just asking that we please
accept gun violence as an epidemic.
I beg of our citizens and leaders:
please, let's stop ignoring the pre-
ventable tragedies occurring daily
and sit down for a real conversation
about gun violence in America.

JARED SZUBA |VEWPOINT
Eleven years after

The sky was a striking blue. The air was
hot, but not unusual for late August in Lower
Manhattan. I rode into the city via train on a
bit of a whim, finally paying a long-ago self-
sworn trip of reverence to the sixteen-acre
site that was the resting place of my uncle
Stephen. Not wanting to bear the somewhat
uncomfortable air of making the trip alone, I
texted a few friends. All responded that they
were busy with this or that. One of my closer
friends was already at her boyfriend's apart-
ment in Midtown - of course she'd join me,
she wrote.
I've been to Ground Zero before. In late
November of 2001 I'd gazed at (but utterly
failed to take in) the twisted, smoking horror
of what was then somewhat cynically dubbed
"the pile." In September of 2002, I stood in
the gaping square crater while President
Bush awkwardly attempted his best consola-
tion at the first anniversary of the exceptional
war crime. I've walked past it a dozen times
since then, poking my head around the tangle
of chain-link fences for a good angle to see
just how the local bureaucrats were slowly
rearranging the site from an open downtown
laceration into a tender scar.
Spending most months of the year in Mich-
igan, and some in Europe, left little time for
home and family, a sacrifice I unthinkingly
dove into three years ago in pursuit of a top-
notch education. I'd been occasionally check-
ing the construction progress of One World
Trade Center from afar via the Internet, and
on the day the welding of an I-beam trans-
formed it into the tallest building in New
York, I tweeted a tidbit with a trace of home-
town nostalgia and contentment.
Seeing it in real life, however, delivered a
sensation poles apart. Though it was incom-
plete, it hit me as too clean. The tower's sur-
face was an eerily flawless mirror; its stature
dwarfed my senses. It seemed out of reach.
Beautiful, though, I told myself as my friend
and I cruised past the gagglinghordes of over-
weight tourists (family members and friends
of victims had a separate, expedited entrance
process. It was something I felt I didn't
deserve, but was nonetheless thankful for).
We passed through security and entered
a pristine park. Young trees rose from fresh-
looking woodchip mulch. Perfectly folded
and organized pamphlets in probably a dozen
languages offered a guided tour of the memo-
rial, the essence of which was experienced in
two cavernous square fountains in the foot-
prints of the former towers. Dark and spar-
kling, these massive holes in the ground were
each outlined by a counter-like bronze ledge
bearing the names of the 2,977 victims plus

the six from the 1993 bombing.
But the somewhat off-putting sterility was
not complete - I noticed the dark enamel had
been slightly rubbed away in the south-west
corner of the south fountain. It looked almost
trashy in comparison with the fresh-from-
the-package feel of the other surroundings.
Why there, and nowhere else? I glanced over
my shoulder at the pattern of entering tour-
ists and understood. This area of the memori-
al was closest to the entrance. It was the most
convenient spot for heavy-legged sightseers.
This corner was flooded with kids, teens
and baby-boomers of every American stripe.
A handful of visitors nonchalantly sat on the
bronze ledge, planting their asses on the tex-
tual remnants of the deceased. Bored moms
and dads with receding hairlines snapped
photos of grinning kids pointing to the
gleaming tower. A Hispanic-looking young
woman dipped her hands in the fountain's
water and splashed it across her forearms,
nasally complaining of the heat. Powder blue
signs reminded visitors that throwing trash
in the fountains was prohibited.
I approached Steve's name with the help
of the brochure, but - "Excuse me" was all I
said, and quite politely. The girl straightened
up and removed her repose from my uncle's
name. She was probably only 12 or 13, but her
abashed look suggested she understood the
coarseness of her leisure. I couldn't be mad
at her; she had been a baby when the attacks
occurred. It was the behavior of the adults
that nauseated me.
I consoled my disenchantment by tell-
ing myself that they were mostly from out-
of-state or abroad. At the risk of sounding
conceited, I admit having thought that New
Yorkers would've been more reverent. I've
noticed over the years that the further one
travels from the epicenters of 9/11, less of the
population holds that inner solemnity for the
event. A friend here at the University once
admitted the attacks never really touched
her emotionally. Several Germans I've met
proudly boast America indirectly brought
the attacks on itself. A 2011 study by the Pew
Research Center revealed that in Egypt, 75
percent of Muslims do not believe Arabs were
responsible for 9/11. 92 percent of Afghan
men polled in 2010 have never heard of 9/11.
That widespread detachment doesn't
bother me much. There are still quite a few of
us who will indisputably "never forget." But
for the rest, I think fleetingly, maybe the city
should have left the site just a crudely gutted
hole in the ground.

Congressman Paul Ryan have been
goading Americans to consider one
simple and seemingly obvious ques-
tion: "Are you better off now than
you were four years ago?" In fram-
ing this election as a referendum on
President Obama, the goal of Rom-
ney's question is clear: if a voter
answers 'no,' they might begin to
doubt the effectiveness of the cur-
rent administration, which would
make them consider a vote for Rom-
ney as a path to becoming'better off.'
I know as well as anyone that
elections have never been based in
sound logic or strict truth-telling.
But if only in the interest of reason
as an ideal of liberal democracy, I
want to spell out explicitly the flaws
inherent in asking if you are "better
off now than you were four years
ago," and use that answer asa guide
for who to vote for in this election.
The first problem is that it's
framed not in terms of the well-
being of Americans in aggregate,
but in terms of a single listener
("are you better off?). It seems that
in framing the choice of who will
lead a nation, a moral agent ought
to consider not only the well-being
of himself but the well-being of his
fellow citizens as well. (You'll have
to excuse my naive idealism here

- I'm a philosophy major, and I'd
much rather deal with the world
as it ought to be rather than as it
actually is). An incrementally more
appropriate question might be, "Are
we better off than we were four
years ago?"
But, even framing the question in
terms of collective well-being can-
not suffice to make this a legitimate
question as it relates to your choice
in this election. The reason is simple:
Romney's question asks the listener
to consider a net increase or decrease
in well-being over time - "Are you
better off than you were four years
ago?" - rather than counterfactual
well-being -"Are you better off than
you would have been under different
leadership and policies?" Of course,
the latter question doesn'thave quite
the same rhetorical ring as the for-
mer, but I'm concerned only with
reason here, not rhetoric.
For example, consider the 2004
presidential election which pitted
the incumbent George W. Bush
against the Democratic challeng-
er Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). In
the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, it would have been simply
absurd for Kerry to ask Americans
if they were better off than they
were four years ago. The country
was still reeling from the tragedy
of only three years prior, had just
been catapulted into two wars

and was still recovering from the
recession of 2002-2003. The ques-
tion of whether or not Americans
were, strictly speaking, 'better off'
did not even enter into the public
debate - rather, Kerry asked the
sensible question of whether or not
Americans were satisfied with the
trajectory of their current leader-
ship given the enduring difficulties
of war, recession and tragedy.
This is not 2004, and President
Obama faces markedly different
challenges than Bush did in his
first term. But our current chal-
lenges cannot be understated: we
are still in the throes of the deepest
global recession since World War
II, according to the International
Monetary Fund. Given these cir-
cumstances, can it make any sense
at all to simply ask whether or not
you are better off now than you
were four years ago?
It's up to voters to consider the
successes and shortcomings of the
Obama administration, and pit them
against their understanding of Rom-
ney's plan for America. Ultimately,
each voter will generate his or her
own answers to the central ques-
tions of this election. But please,
when formulating these questions,
let's at least be sure they make sense
to ask before giving an answer.

'Babysitter' Hoke tempers praise for freshmen

Michigan has played
12 freshmen, more
than Hoke has ever
played in career
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Devin Funcheas baffled the Air
Force defenae on Saturday, blow-

apeed, outmuscling the smaller

.* ing everyone else with a perfor-

a freshman. He wowed everyone,
it seemed, except for Michigan
coach Brady Hoke.
"It looked like he played a good
game," Hoke said on Saturday.
"Can you expound?" one
reporter asked.
"He was productive," Hoke
said with a smirk, and that was
that.
The notoriously, tight-lipped
Hoke is not one to ramble, hut he
was particularly reserved when
speaking about Funchess, or
about the rest of his freshmen for
that matter. And for good reason:
Michigan's reliance on the fresh-
man class -12 have played so far
this year, with many playing sig-
nificant minutes - threatens to
undermine Hoke's philosophy of
leading through his seniors. On
Monday, Hoke said he has never
coached a team that played more
freshmen than this year.
Hoke preaches often about
the importance of seniors, and
he uses the eldest members of

t was another freshman lineback-
,,w; er, James Ross III, who was there.
After the game, one reporter
fgasked Hoke what Bolden and Ross
had proved against Air Force and
what they needed to improve on.
Hoke skipped the first part of that
"thnk the second part of the
question, there's a lotethey need to
w get better at," Hoke said. "From
drops and coverages to footwork,
all those things."
Of course, Hoke's apparent
cynicism is tempered by experi-
ence. After the opener against
Alabama, Hoke said the team had
to "babysit" freshmen on their
first road trip, and mocked that
they had to get "on a big boy jet"
and play "in a big boy stadium
with a big boy team."

show on the field, but off it he

the team as vehicles for his own
coaching values. The seniors,
unlike other classes, participate
in leadership seminars, and Hoke
took the seniors alone to train
with Navy SEALs in California
over the summer. When redshirt
senior lineman Elliott Mealer
addressed the media on Monday,
he wore ablue polo with a winged

helmet on the right breast and
"TEAM 133" embroidered below.
Above: "SENIOR."
Yet the freshman class has
begun to assert itself. On the field,
that is not a bad thing; Michigan
recruited them for a reason. On
one play on Saturday, six Michi-
gan defenders were freshmen.
"This is Michigan. They come

to Michigan to play football, and
if they play well enough in prac-
tice and in workouts, they're
gonna play," said senior defen-
sive tackle Will Campbell. "It just

But early returns are a bit trou-

a solid job after switching spots

right tackle Taylor Lewan, a pre-
season All-America candidate
and a potential early entrant to
the NFL draft next spring, called
the line's performance "awful"
immediately after the game on
Saturday. After watching the
game film, he was less critical on
Monday, pointing to Robinson's
rushing totals.
But he echoed Healer's senti-
ments about needing to get better.
"My goal for the running back
is 150-plus yards every week,"
Lewan said. "That's my goal, per-
sonally, and the offensive line's.
Our stats are Denard's rushing
yards and our rushing yards.
Those are our stats, and we have
to take pride in that."
.The aspect of the line's per-
formance that may be a bit over-
looked is in the passing game,
and Lewan said he's pleased
with the way the line has pass
blocked. Michigan gave up one
sack against Alabama and none
against Air Force, with Robin-
son's mobility helping to ease
pressure concerns.
But the run blocking for the
backs will be a major focus this
week against Massachusetts,
and it will likely need tu be much
improved in order to beat Notre
Dame the week after.
"I don't know if I'm real con-
cerned at this time," Hoke said. "I
think one, I give (Air Force) a lot
of credit for what their plan was.
I chink as a group they're coming
together. I think we've got to be
more consistent and better at the
point of attack on some things,
but I'm not concerned yet."

By DYLAN McKENZIE
Daily Sports Writer
Fresh off their international
performances for their respective
home countries in the Under-20
women's World Cup in Japan, the
Michigan trio of junior forward
Nkem Ezurike, junior defender
Shelina Zadorsky and sophomore
midfielder Christina Murillo hope
the experience can carry over into
the collegiate season.
Ezurike and Zadorsky, who
competed for Canada, and
Murillo, who played for Mexi-
co, rejoined the Wolverines last
weekend during Michigan's road
trip to California. Despite feeling
the effects of jet-lag in their first
couple of games back, the three
players made it clear that they are
in a class of their own.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan,
who was the U.S. Women's
National Team head coach for
three years, believes that the time
spent overseas had a huge impact
on the growth of the three play-
ers.
"Christina Murillo is a prime
example," Ryan said. "She was
a very good player last year but
she's taken it three levels higher.
Honestly, I don't see many col-
lege players playing the way she is
right now."
The World Cup took enormous
amounts of extra training and
months of preparation for the trio
and has paid dividends, especially
for Murillo, who left Ann Arbor
after the first semester last year to
train with the Mexican national
team.
"The past six or seven months
have helped me improve on my
one-on-one skills and I think it
helped on my shooting abilities,"
Murillo said.
Ryan hopes that the trio's
improvement from the interna-
tional circuit will push them to
become clear-cut leaders. How-
ever, due to the three players'
absence from the team during
international play, Ryan expects
their teammates to carry them as
they transition back to playing for
Michigan.
"I expect the other players
to carry them in this transition
time," Ryan said. "They haven't
been training with us and some-
times aren't in sync with the
team."
Perhaps most important of all
is the fact that the initial taste of
the World Cup has made the trio
hungrier to get better in order

Junior forward Nkem Ezurike is expected to he a major contributor this tall.

to try and make their respective
national squads in the next World
Cup.
"It was a phenomenal experi-
ence and a great honor to repre-
sent your country on the world
stage," said Zadorsky. "But I'm
going to keep working at iL."
If Sunday's game at Oakland
was any indication of things to
come, it is a great sign for the

team. Ezurike pressured Oak-
land's defense all day and the
lone goal was a difficult shot from
Murillo.
Zadorsky led the defense in a
shutout.
And there is no indication that
every game can't play out this way.
"Somewhere down the road,
these girls will carry us," Ryan
said.

Chicago teachers strike in
bitter contract dispute

Visitors to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum look at one of two reflecting pools at the World Trade
Center, on Thursday.
Debate surrounds annual
cost of Sept.11-memorial

Union in nation's
third largest
district strike for
1st time in 25 years
CHICAGO (AP) - For the
first time in a quarter century,
Chicago teachers walked out of
the classroom .Monday,. taking
a bitter contract dispute over
evaluations and job security to
the streets of the nation's third-
largest city - and to a national
audience - less than a week after
most schools opened for fall.
The walkout forced hun-
dreds of thousands of parents to
scramble for a place to send idle
children and created an unwel-
come political distraction for
Mayor Rahm Emanuel. In a year
when labor unions have been
losing ground nationwide, the
implications were sure to extend{
far beyond Chicago, particularly
for districts engaged in similar
debates.
The two sides resumed negoti-
ations Mondaybut failed to reach
a settlement, meaning the strike
will extend into at least a second
day. Chicago School Board Presi-
dent David Vitale told reporters
that board and union negotia-
tors did not even get around to
bargaining on the two biggest
issues.
"This is a long-termbattle that
everyone's going to watch," said

Eric Hanuskek, a senior fellow
in education at the Hoover Insti-
tution of Stanford University.
"Other teachers unions in the
United States are wondering if
they should follow suit."
The union had vowed to strike
Monday Ifiere was.no agree-
ment on a new contract, even
though the district had offered
a 16 percent raise over four years
and the two sides had essentially
agreedon a longer school day.
With an average annual salary
of $76,000, Chicago teachers are
among the highest-paid in the
nation, according to the National
Council on Teacher Quality.
But negotiators were still
divided on job security mea-
sures and a system for evaluat-
ing teachers that hinged in part
on students' standardized test
scores.
The strike in a district where
the vast majority of students are
poor and minority put Chicago
at the epicenter of a struggle
between big cities and teachers
unionsforcontrol of schools.
Emanuel,whohassoughtmajor
reforms while also confronting
the district's $700 million budget
shortfall, acknowledged his own
fight with the union, even as he
urged a quick resolution.
"Don't take it out on the kids
of Chicago if you have a problem
with me," he told reporters Mon-
day.
As negotiators resumed talks,
thousands of teachers and their

supporters took over several
downtown streets during the
Monday evening rush. Police
secured several blocks around
district headquarters as the
crowds marched and chanted.
The protesters planned to rally
through the evening at an event
that resembled a family street
fair. Balloons, American flags and
homemade signs hung above the
crowd.
Teacher Kimberly Crawford-
said she was most concerned
about issues such as class size and
the lack of air conditioning.
"It's not just about the raise,"
she said. "I've worked without a
raise for two years."
The strike quickly became
part of the presidential cam-
paign. Republican candidate Mitt
Romney said teachers were turn-
ing their backs on students and
Obama was siding with the strik-
ing teachers in his hometown.
Obama's top spokesman said
the president has not taken sides
but is urging both the sides to
settle quickly.
Emanuel, who just agreed to
take a larger role in fundrais-
ing for Obama's re-election, dis-
missed Romney's comments as
"lip service."
But one labor expert said that
a major strike unfolding in the
shadow of the November elec-
tion could only hurt a president
who desperately needs the votes
of workers, includingteachers, in
battleground states.

progress stopped amid a con-

the memorial foundation and

and New Jersey, the agency
that owns the trade center site.
The Port Authority claimed
the memorial foundation owed

the foundation argued it was
owed money because of project
delays.
The parties involved in the
dispute said Monday they had
reached ran agreement. Their
memorandum of understand-
ing addresses issues including
coordination of the site and gen-
eral financial terms but doesn't
go into detail on specific levels
of financing. The agreement
outlines that the memorial will
have six months' operating

ing capital and that it will give
the Port Authority a security;

ity expenses, but it doesn't say
what those figures are.
Even so, it remains unclear
how the foundation will cover
the costs of running the muse-

the impoverished Arab nation.
Saeed al-Shihri, a Saudi
national who fought in Afghan-
istan and spent six years in the
U.S. military prison at Guanta-
namo Bay, was killed by a mis-
sile after leaving a house in the
southern province of Hadra-
mawt, according to Yemeni
military officials. They said the
missile was believed to have
been fired by a U.S.-operated,
unmanned drone aircraft.
~~Two"seOr' U.S. officials
confirmed al-Shihri's death
but could not confirm any U.S.
involvement in the airstrike.
The U.S. doesn't usually com-
menfon such-attacks although
it has used drones in the past
to go after al-Qaida members
in Yemen, which is considered
a crucial battleground with the
terror network.
Yemeni military officials
said that a local forensics team
had identified al-Shihri's body
with the help .of U.S. forensics
experts on the ground. The U.S.
and Yemeni military officials
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because they weren't autho-
rized to release the information
to the media.
Late Monday, after specula-
-tion surfaced that the attack
was carried by a U.S. drone,
Yemen's Defense Ministry
issued a statement saying al-
Shihri and six companions
were -killed during an opera-
tion by Yemeni armed forces
in Wadi Hadramawt, but it did
not elaborate on how they were
killed.
Yemeni military officials said
they had believed the United
States was behind the operation
because their own army does
not the capacity to carry out pre-
cise aerial attacks and because
Yemeni intelligence gathering
capabilities on al-Shihri's move-
ments were limited.
A brief Defense Minis-
try statement sent to Yeme-
ni reporters on their mobile
phones earlier in the day only
said that an attack had targeted
the militants. It did not specify
who carried out the attack or
when ittook place.
Al-Shihri's death is a major
blow to al-Qaida's Yemen
branch, which is seen as the
world's most active, plan-
ning and carrying out attacks
against targets on and outside
U.S. territory. The nation sits
--on"the-southern-tip of-the Ara-
bian Peninsula and is on the
doorstep of Saudi Arabia and
fellow oil-producing nations of
the Gulf and lies on strategic
searoutes leading to the Suez
Canal.

The group formally known
as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Pen-
insula took advantage of the
political vacuum during unrest
inspired by the Arab Spring last
year to take control of large
swaths of land in the south.
But the Yemeni military has
launched a broad U.S-hacked
offensive and driven the mili-
tants from several towns.
After leaving Guantanamo in
2007, al-Shihri, who is believed
-to be in his late 30s, went
through Saudi Arabia's famous
"rehabilitation" institutes, an
indoctrination program that
is designed to replace what
-authorities in Saudi Arabia see
as militant ideology with reli-
gious moderation.
But he headed south to
Yemen upon release and
became deputy to Nasser al-
Wahishi, the leader of Al-Qaida
in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-
Wahishi is a Yemeni who once
served as Osama bin Laden's
personal aide in Afghanistan.
Al-Qaida in Yemen has been
linked to several attempted
attacks on U.S. targets, includ-
ing the foiled Christmas Day
2009 bombing of an airliner
over Detroit and explosives-
laden parcels intercepted
aboard cargo flights last year.
Last year, a high-profile U.S.
drone strike killed U.S.-born
Anwar al-Awlaki, who had been
linked to the planning and exe-
cution of several attacks target-
ing U.S. and Western interests,
including the attempt to down a
Detroit-bound airliner in 2009
and the plot to bomb cargo
planes in 2010.
Unlike other al-Qaida
branches, the network's mili-
tants in Yemen have gone
beyond the concept of plant-
ing sleeper cells and actively
sought to gain a territorial foot-
hold in lawless areas, mainly
in the south of Yemen, before
they were pushed back by U.S.-
backed Yemeni government
forces after months of inter-
mittent battles. The fighting
has killed hundreds of Yemeni
soldiers.
The Yemen-based militants
have struck Western targets
in the area twice in the past 12
years. In 2000, they bombed
the USS Cole destroyer in Aden
harbor, killing 17 sailors. Two
years later, they struck a French
oil tanker, also off Yemen.
U.S. drone strikes have
intensified in Yemen in recent
months, killing several key al-
Qaida operatives, including
Samir Khan, an al-Qaida pro-
pagandist whowas killed in a
drone strike last year.

The Avett Brothers
hammer out soulful
hits on new album
By ANDREW WEINER
ManagingEditor
Scott and Seth Avett, two-
fifths of folk-rock outfit the Avett
Brothers, are the subjects of the
new chromatic
GAP televi-
sion spots. The 7k**

feature the The Avett
pair in a clas- Brothers

scale studio, The Carpenter
just the Avetts Republic
and their gui-
tars. Watching
their eyes, it's clear something
isn't quite right - Americana,
melancholia, banjo and skinny
jeans? Both appear determined
not to meet the camera's eye-
line. They're the same folks who
helped bring American folk back
to the (near) mainstream in their
previous six albums, notably
2009's I and Love and You, but
with a cloudy blanket of corpo-
rate awkwardness. Would their
latest, The Carpenter, suffer
from the same?
"The Once and Future Car-
penter," opens the album and
answers this question with a
resounding "No." Right away,
the Avetts and their bassist Bob
Crawford (the core of the band)

remind us that they're real,
touch-the-dirt American musi-
cians. Simple guitar strumming
- other bands strum, but the
Avett Brothers strum - begins
the rhymed reflection on death.
In the course of the first minute
and a half, a second set of strings
joins, then another, and soon
voices add harmony. What start-
ed as a man and a guitar quickly
evolves into a humble tour-de-
force worthy of starting off The
Carpenter.
The words hit on beat in
"Pretty Girl from Michigan,"
until without warning, the last
lines spit rapid fire as if the
"Pretty Girl" stormed away and
the singer was compelled to fin-
ish his thought before the door
slammed. Like the vocals, the
guitar takes an unexpected turn
toward hard rock at the chorus.
But like a North Carolina gentle-
man, the rift is quick and the song
composes itself again. There's a
mish-mash of reasons it didn't
work out with the "Pretty Girl" -
first he blames her, then himself,
then, yeah, it was probably his
fault: "The way you cut the rope
that kept you dangling from such
pitiful amounts of hope / I would
have cut it too." Cue dramatic
guitar solo.
The cello steals "February
Seven," a haunting ballad of for-
getting but not necessarily for-
giving. "There's no returning to
the spoils / Once you've spoiled
the thought of them / There's no
falling back to sleep /Once you've

waken from the dream." The
cello is dreary enough for the wet
end of winter and its persistence
complements and.challenges the
lyrics in a battle of the disheart-
ened.
"Through My Prayers" follows,
its melody highly reminiscent of
"The Ballad of Love and Hate,"
from the Brothers' Emotionalism.
But "Ballad" is better, and this
track is easily passed over.
The biggest disappointment
on The Carpenter is that "Ger-
aldine" is only a hair over 90
seconds long. Its beat and four-
word-by-four-line stanzas are
up tempo and necessarily quick
- a shot of adrenaline before the
album fizzles out. Sandwiched
between "Geraldine" and album
closer "Life," the experimental
rock show "Paul Newman vs. the
Demons" sounds unneeded and
out of place.
"Life" is the perfect bookend
to complement "The Once and
Future Carpenter." It wouldn't
be an Avett Brothers album with-
out a casual reference to "hell on
earth," but overall the closer is
sentimental in instrumentation
and lyric. Exploring how love and
honesty can make life unearthly,
"Life" is the album's defining
track.
Produced by rock auteur Rick
Rubin, The Carpenter solidifies
that Avett Brothers can continue
to stay relevant with their classic
folk. The Gap jeans may be too
tight in a spot or two, but they
look great by and large.

It seemed
familiar - but
why? Were the wardrobe's retro
silhouettes stretched over the
mannequins of a nearby Urban
Outfitters? Did Instagram send
the film through the "Earlybird"
filter like an indie car wash? Was
I just watching too much "Mad
Men"? (Probably, no, yes).
"It's a Wes Anderson thing,"
replied my neighbor, her words
muffled by a fistful of popcorn
and the sudden hush of the audi-
ence as the stars of "Moonrise
Kingdom" shuffled closer in the
sand for a smooch. Yes, that Wes
Anderson thing. How could I
forget?
There's a thrill in discovering
new talent - nudging an art-
ist from iTunes to make room
for the precious new addition
(it's a boy!); adding a fan page to
Facebook so that the world can
ooh-and-ahh at your broadened
horizons. Yet there's an irre-
futable joy in rediscovery, like
unburying a childhood toy from
the depths of the closet, an arti-
fact of the once loved.
As a long-time fan of the "The
Royal Tenenbaums" director, I'd
smudge my eyeliner iila Gwyn-

with Anderson's world of quiet
nostalgia, deadpan gazes and dry
humor.

Pretend you're back in high
school, and David Byrne and
Annie Clark are in your class (for-

They're the
weird kids who

ward to 2012,
and they are
still the same old weirdos, but
now they're also the cool kids,
hugely successful and loved by
thousands. And now, they've col-
laborated to create the highly-
anticipated Love This Giant - an
album that feels like a 45-minute,
brass-filled inside joke.
While almost any living per-
son with a set of healthy ears
has heard of Talking Heads and
its founding member, Rock and
Roll Hall of Famer David Byrne,
Annie Clark is a name less rec-
ognized but equally adored.
Known for her band St. Vincent,
with its manic, distorted guitar
lines and cherubic vocals, fans
anticipating Love This Giant may
be unsure of what to expect from
her alliance with the genteel
David Byrne.
With the release of the first
single and first track off the
album "Who," the public was
finally given a metallic taste of
Love This Giant. "Who" seems
to be a peek inside the funky
relationship Byrne and Clark
established in their time togeth-

er. Cheeky horns kick off the
song, and Byrne begins a series
of punchy questions balanced
by Clark's croons. Simply put,
"Who" is fun - a clear departure
from the dark, I'm-going-crazy
stuff St. Vincent fans are used to.
"Who," like much of the album,
has a heavy dose of Byrne's
vocals, which makes Giant seem
unfairly lopsided. The idea for
the brass rampant throughout
Love This Giant, however, was all
