Robert 
Ortega, 
chair 

of 
the 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs, 
opened 
Monday’s 

meeting by alerting members 
of the groundbreaking of the 
new 
Trotter 
Multicultural 

Center and the release of the 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
survey results.

The climate survey found 

1 in 5 University of Michigan 
students 
experienced 
a 

discriminatory event during 
the past year, even though 
the large majority of students 
— 72 percent — reported 
satisfaction with the current 
campus climate.

Ortega began the meeting 

by asking members to think 
deeply about the findings of 
the survey.

“There’s 
important 

differences that we ought 
to be taking a look at and 
thinking about what they 
mean in terms of some of the 
views that could easily get 
masked if we’re not thinking 
about those different voices,” 
Ortega said.

Some 
members 

questioned 
the 
survey’s 

representativeness. 
SACUA 

member 
Neil 
Marsh 
said 

the 
survey’s 
randomness 

was 
questionable 
because 

respondents had to choose to 
respond.

“Ninety-three 
percent 

of 
the 
respondents 
are 

heterosexual; 
slightly 
over 

half are male,” Ortega said.

Other members, such as 

mechanical 
engineering 

professor 
Bill 
Schultz, 

expressed concerns over the 
survey’s length and scope.

“Some of it was definitely 

repetitive, I think just to see 
if you were paying attention,” 

Schultz said.

Schultz added the survey 

was advertised to take 20 
minutes, but actually took 
some people about 50 minutes. 
He then prompted meeting 
attendees to raise their hands 
if they got a survey.

Members 
were 
also 

confused why data collected 
in Fall of 2016 was being 

published over a year later. 

The Office of Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion recently 
announced a new upcoming 
survey of 5,000 librarians, 
curators, 
postdoctoral 

fellows and house officers at 
Michigan Medicine. This will 
be similar to the prior climate 
surveys sent to students and 

University 
Council 
met 

Monday 
evening 
for 
its 

biweekly 
meeting 
in 
the 

Michigan Union, discussing 
the possibility of a resolution 
to support and provide a 
greater 
awareness 
toward 

student caregivers, as well as 
other topics such as Central 
Student Government’s meeting 
Tuesday on the Diag and this 
week’s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion summit.

Business 
senior 
Grace 

Nasr proposed an idea for the 
resolution to raise awareness 
of 
student 
caregivers 
— 

students who have children on 
campus — specifically through 
modifying syllabus language.

“We’re just hoping to plant 

the seeds for change so that 
maybe one day this can be 
implemented 
in 
syllabus 

language … whether it be 
through the language we have 
presented, or something else, 
for nontraditional students,” 
she said. “It’s just something 
to kind of get the ball rolling, 
whether it be passing this

The results of Ann Arbor’s 

Changing 
Driver 
Behavior 

Study were released Monday. 
The 
study, 
geared 
toward 

pedestrian safety and local 
drivers, showed a doubling 
in 
stopping 
at 
crosswalks 

with increased enforcement 
from the Ann Arbor Police 
Department.

The study began in June 

with increased enforcement 
at 
crosswalks 
on 
major 

commuting routes in Ann 
Arbor and ended the last week 
of October. Through the course 
of the study, officers stopped 
hundreds 
of 
drivers 
and 

issued failure-to-yield tickets 
and warnings. The Changing 
Driver Behavior Study says the 
final round of the study will 
start on November 7.

At the targeted crosswalks, 

the 
rate 
of 
stopping 
for 

pedestrians 
went 
from 
27 

percent to 58 percent. At the 
sites where no enforcement 
took place, stopping rates went 
from 37 percent to 49 percent.

As a kickoff to its week of 

summit events, marking one 
year since the launch of the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plan, the Office of Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion debriefed 
results of its sample climate 
survey Monday to the student 
body at the Michigan Union. 
The event also allowed for 
dialogue 
between 
students, 

faculty, staff and the U-M 
Survey 
Research 
Center 

and SoundRocket team who 

conducted the survey. About 
20 students, faculty and staff 
attended.

The meeting began with 

Robert Sellers, the vice provost 
for equity and inclusion, who 
discussed the purpose of the 
survey and its significance to 
the DEI initiative.

“In this day of alternative 

facts, where facts have lost 
a little bit of its value, we 
feel strongly that what we 
are attempting to do needs 
to be based on the very best 
(measurements) at hand, and 
we also need to find ways to

Ramasami 
began 
his 

presentation — which was 

a part of the Ford School of 
Public Policy’s Policy Talks 
series — by discussing the 
perceived roles of science, 
technology and innovation 
in developmental economies 
and national prosperity. He 
explained that countries that 
have the greatest need for 
STI have fewer resources to 
invest in it, and developments 
in STI could help the people 
in developing countries the 
most.

“The resources available 

for the developing economies 
to invest in the STI are not 
properly 
matching 
with 

the needs that they have,” 
Ramasami said.

resolution through CSG or 
just having University Council 
submit a statement of support 
or solidarity that they agree 
that there should be more 
awareness or resources for 
student caregivers.”

According 
to 
Nasr, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

currently does not collect any 
data on student caregivers and 
there is currently no estimate 
on the number of student 
caregivers 
studying 
at 
the 

University.

“That 
was 
one 
of 
the 

challenges that we faced,” 
Nasr said. “The reason why we 
wanted to go through student 
government first was that we 
tried to go through professors 
and administration first … 
there was no data on this 
(student caregiver) population 
on campus.”

The council discussed the 

potential 
resolution 
with 

members, bouncing ideas off 
one another and providing 

feedback 
toward 
both 
the 

language and approach of the 
document. Rackham student 
Naomi Wilson advised the 
resolution should have clear 
explanations 
of 
resources 

available 
for 
graduate 
and 

undergraduate students.

“I think it’s important to 

delineate between graduates 
and undergraduates because 
I 
think 
in 
the 
graduate 

population 
we 
have 
a 
lot 

of 
resources 
for 
student 

caregivers,” Wilson said. “If 
we’re going to sign it as the 
University Council, I would 
like some clear language as it 
relates to student population.”

Following discussion on the 

potential resolution, CSG Vice 
President Nadine Jawad, a 
Public Policy senior, addressed 
the council and highlighted 
upcoming events. She spoke 
of Tuesday’s CSG meeting on 
the Diag, introduced by CSG 
President 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 

an LSA senior, to incorporate 
more of a public-forum aspect 
into weekly meetings. She 
also 
underscored 
Tuesday’s 

Washtenaw County elections 

and encouraged the body to 
promote use of TurboVote, 
a 
mobile 
voter 
and 
civic 

engagement platform used by 

the Big Ten Voting Challenge 
to provide users with updates 
and alerts.

Jawad also highlighted the 

DEI summit held this week 
on campus. Low attendance 
rates 
at 
Monday’s 
events 

spurred conversation within 

the council, as members 
discussed 
advertisement 

of 
the 
summit 
and 

suggested ways to remedy 
communications 
issues 

between the administration 
and students in regard to 
University-wide events.

Engineering 
senior 

Breanna DeCocker used the 
email sent to Engineering 
students as an example, 
even though she criticized 
its lack of promotion of the 
summit.

“I just found an email 

from my dean two weeks 
ago that casually mentioned 
the DEI summit very deep 
inside the email,” DeCocker 
said. “First of all, barely 
anyone reads those emails 
because they’re too long; 
two, it usually just goes to 
people’s spam folders; and 
three, where are the actual 
physical 
advertisements 

that are in your face so 
that when you’re walking 
around you’re reminded of 
it constantly?”

Panelists discuss North Korea’s successful publicity campaign that has

GLOBAL PANE L

Two University of Michigan 

alumni were chosen in October 
as some of Crain’s “40 Under 40.” 
Crain’s, a publication dedicated 
to Detroit business and industry 
news, publishes the list annually 
to honor some of the best young 
businesspeople in the city.

Detroit native Emily Linn, who 

graduated from the School of Art 
& Design and LSA in 2000, is a 
co-founder and creative director of 
City Bird, an art gallery and shop 
in Detroit’s Cass Corridor. Run by 
Linn and her brother, who is also 
a University alum, City Bird has 
sold locally made art, apparel and 
handcrafted goods since 2009. Now, 
Linn is focused on growing the 
business. She and her brother have 
begun selling their locally made 
products online to nearly 100 shops 
and museums around the state. 
With this expansion, their revenue 
is expected to reach $2 million this 
year.

In a 2013 interview with 

Michigan Today, Linn said she liked 
working in the Cass Corridor, as 
the neighborhood shops all worked 

together as a community. She noted 
business owners even get coffee for 
one another when their shops are 
busy.

“We support each other’s 

stores,” Linn said. “It’s helpful for 
all of us to have more businesses 
so the area becomes a shopping 
destination.”

Rebecca O’Reilly, who 

graduated in 2000, earned her 
spot on the list as a partner 
and co-chair for the Employee 
Benefits and Executive 
Compensation Practice Group 
at Bodman PLC, a Detroit-
based law firm. While she left 
Bodman in 2015 to start her 
own practice, she soon found 
her business was too successful 
for just one person to handle. 
O’Reilly considered merging 
with another firm, and Bodman 
jumped at the chance to have 
her back on its team.

“They came back to me and 

said, ‘We love what you’ve done 
with your practice, we see how 
it’s worked, and we believe in 
what you’re doing,’” O’Reilly 

told Crain’s. “‘Just bring it all back 
— we’ll do it the way you want to 
do it.’”

She took the company up on its 

offer, and this year she established 
Bodman’s Employee Benefits and 
Executive Compensation Practice 
Group. She loves living in Detroit.

“If you really want to be 

involved, to be part of the 
community, there are endless 
opportunities here,” she said.

From Page 1A

I think it’s 
important 
to delineate 

between 

graduates and 
undergraduates 


staff.

In addition earlier this week, 

students were also sent a second 
climate survey. 

SACUA 
members 
later 

spoke about the new Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center’s 

groundbreaking. 
Construction 

on the future site began over 
the summer outside the Helen 
Newberry and Betsy Barbour 
residences on State Street.

The 
Trotter 
Center 
is 

currently located in an old 

fraternity house on Washtenaw 
Avenue. In Winter 2014, the 
Black Student Union called for 
the relocation of the site as part 
of the #BBUM movement.

Dec. 17, 2016, the University’s 

Board of Regents approved a 
proposal to relocate the Trotter 
Center. Following that meeting, 
E. Royster Harper, Director 
of student life, said the new 
location was chosen to make the 
Trotter Center more visible. 

It was not until April 2017, the 

Board of Regents granted final 
approval to issue the contracts 
and bids to begin construction. 

The 
new 
center 
will 

be 
20,000-square-feet, 

approximately 9,000 feet larger 
than the current facilities, it is 
set to open Winter 2019. 

“My understanding is that 

it’s going to be the new Trotter 
house,” Ortega said. “I’ve gotten 
different 
versions 
of 
what’s 

going to happen. I don’t know if 
anyone else has heard anything.”

At the time of the meeting, 

some SACUA members had not 
seen design plans for the new 
building.

SACUA 
then 
went 
into 

executive session, which The 
Michigan Daily is not permitted 
to attend. 

assess 
what 
progress 

we have made and also the 
challenges that we still have 
yet to achieve,” Sellers said.

Assistant 
Vice 
Provost 

Katrina 
Wade-Golden, 
who 

oversaw the implementation 
of the plan, then went on to 
describe how the survey was 
conducted 
and 
its 
results, 

citing the desire to measure 
the 
“temperature” 
of 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

campus 
climate 
and 
how 

mindsets can be evolved.

“One thing that we know 

from social science research 
is that you don’t change hearts 
and minds by lectures,” Wade-
Golden 
said. 
“You 
change 

hearts and minds by (content).”

While Wade-Golden found 

some 
results 
surprising 
— 

such as the 48 percent of 
students 
with 
disabilities 

stating they have experienced 
a discriminatory event in the 
past 12 months on campus 
— 
some 
students 
are 
not 

surprised with some of the 
survey’s conclusions. Public 
Policy senior Jordan Sandman 
said he was not surprised 
with 
the 
data, 
especially 

regarding the responses from 
underrepresented minorities, 
but was surprised with the 
overall high satisfaction level 
of the University’s efforts.

“I notice that this campus 

is 
pretty 
self-segregated,” 

Sandman said. “I think if you 
ask a lot of people and really 
dug deeper rather than just 
having one question where it’s 

a percentage of people who 
respond that they have an 
interaction, if you actually look 
at the interactions that occur 
day to day that it’s far more 
stratified based on race.” 

LSA 
sophomore 
Kendall 

Kaiser 
said 
she 
was 
not 

surprised about the overall 
results, but cited her surprise 
at 
the 
individual 
racial 

statistics and how they may 
have changed in response to 
regarding recent bias incidents 
on campus.

“The problem the University 

of 
Michigan 
has 
is 
being 

prideful 
of 
an 
inclusive 

environment, 
but 
true 

progress hasn’t been made in 
making this environment more 
inclusive,” Kaiser said.

Postdoctoral fellow Austin 

McCoy also did not find the 
results shocking, but believes 
the DEI plan is more long-term 
than short-term.

“It sounds like this DEI plan 

is a long-term plan,” McCoy 
said. “I respect the fact that 
the administration is trying to 
address these issues over the 
long term, but what seems to 
be missing is a short-term plan 
(in) how we address issues 
pertaining to racism or any 
other forms of discrimination 
for students that are still here 
because they are the ones who 
are experiencing these sorts 
of interactions and these 
events.”

Throughout 
anti-racist 

protests last year, frustrated 
students 
criticized 

planners’ 
overlooking 
of 

immediate needs and asked 
Why wait until 2025, will I 
even be alive?

Wade-Golden 
also 

briefly 
mentioned 
an 

update regarding Richard 
Spencer’s request to speak 
at the University.

She said a meeting was 

held at University President 
Mark Schlissel’s home. LSA 
senior Ethan Hong attended 
the session with various 
student 
organizations 

and University executive 
officers 
was 
at 
the 

session, 
and 
said 
he 

attended alongside student 
organizations and executive 
officers. Hong said officials 
have not yet come to a 
conclusion 
regarding 

Spencer’s appearance, but 
the decision will be released 
within the next week.

University spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in 

an email statement the meeting 
at his house was scheduled 
prior to Spencer’s request to 
speak on campus.

“No decisions have been 

made yet regarding Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “This is a 
followup meeting to one they 
had earlier this year, and was 
scheduled before the request 
from Spencer’s team arrived to 
speak on campus.”

The 
controversy 

surrounding Spencer coming 
to speak on campus follows 
after the suit from Spencer’s 
tour 
organizer 
against 

Michigan 
State 
University 

for refusing to host the white 
nationalist on campus earlier 
this year. On Friday, a federal 
judge ordered MSU officials 
into court mediation to settle 
the dispute, ruling that the 
school violated free speech 

rights 
in 
what 
could 
set 

precedent for the University’s 
decision 
on 
Spencer. 
The 

speaker’s 
appearances 
on 

other 
campuses, 
including 

the University of Florida in 
September, 
have 
sparked 

large protests and unrest, but 
schools from Penn State to 
Texas A&M canceled requests 
in the aftermath of white 
supremacist 
rallies 
led 
by 

Spencer in Charlottesville, VA.

passed an ordinance that 
forces motorists to yield to 
pedestrians 
in 
crosswalks 

as well as those waiting to 
cross and has been a source of 
controversy since.

Councilmember 
Jack 

Eaton, D-Ward 4, said he is 
planning to bring forward a 
proposal which would call 
for a review of the ordinance, 
as he says Ann Arbor’s streets 
are filled with people who 
aren’t from Ann Arbor and 
are ignorant of the ordinance.

“Nearly 400 citations have 

been 
issued,” 
Eaton 
told 

Mlive. “We have so many 
visitors to this city every day 
that we really are expecting 
people to know intuitively 
apparently about our unique 
ordinance, and that causes 
me great concern that the 
experiment in enforcement 
has 
shown 
how 
little 

awareness there seems to 
be. Another reason to review 
the ordinance is the rapidly 
advancing 
technology 
of 

autonomous vehicles.”

Ann Arbor resident Kathy 

Griswold said she supports 
cars stopping for pedestrians, 
but has concerns about lights 
being out at crosswalks and 
intersections.

“I fully support vehicles 

stopping 
for 
pedestrians 

within 
a 
crosswalk,” 

Griswold said. “I have grave 
concerns about the number 
of unlit crosswalks and the 
number of streetlights that 
are out around Ann Arbor.”

Griswold 
added 
while 

enforcement has improved 
the rates of stopping by cars 
and thus pedestrian safety, 
there are other measures that 
need to be taken to improve 
safety.

“We 
could 
significantly 

improve 
pedestrian 
safety 

in 
our 
community 
with 

consistently 
marked 

crosswalks, 
proper 

illumination and enforcement 
of stopping for a pedestrian 
within 
a 
crosswalk,” 

Griswold said. “What we’re 
trying to do is go one step 
beyond and have people stop 
for pedestrians on the side 
of the road and I believe that 
is a problem because it is not 
consistent with the rest of 
literally the world. There’s no 
other community that has an 
ordinance like Ann Arbor’s.”

Other 
council 
members 

have voiced their support 
for the ordinance, including 
Julie Grand, D-Ward 3, who 
appreciates 
the 
increased 

enforcement at crosswalks.

“As a parent of a child 

who has now reached the 
age where she is too cool to 
walk with parents, otherwise 
known as middle school, 
I really do appreciate the 
increased enforcement and 
see the tickets in areas that 
we knew were problematic 
as a real gain for our city and 
the safety of our kids,” Grand 
told Mlive. “So I’m pleased to 
see this enforcement, which 
many of us on council have 
asked for, and encourage 
residents to be extra careful 
now that there are lots of 
little 
people 
and 
bigger 

people 
looking 
in 
their 

phones walking to school.”

Pedestrian 
safety 
in 

crosswalks has been a topic 
of discussion for City Council 
for years. 

In September 2015, City 

Council considered Vision 
Zero — an initiative endorsed 
by 
the 
city’s 
Pedestrian 

Safety 
and 
Task 
Force 

Committee that strives to 
eliminate fatalities or serious 
injuries to pedestrians — in 
an attempt to address this 
issue.

A previous council report 

presented 
several 
policy 

proposals 
for 
pedestrian 

safety, including improved 
crosswalks and a ban on using 
hand-held devices for drivers. 
A study conducted in 2015 
reported though Ann Arbor 
crashes involving pedestrians 
represented only 16 percent 
of all crashes, pedestrians 
account for one-third of the 
fatalities 
and 
one-fourth 

of all serious crash-related 
injuries. 

After a fatal crash last 

October 
where 
Qi-Xuan 

“Justin” Tang was struck 
by a car and killed while 
crossing Fuller Road, some 
residents 
questioned 
why 

City Council funding was 
deferred 
from 
pedestrian 

safety to downtown projects. 
In February, City Council 
passed a resolution approving 
funding 
for 
improvements 

to this crossing, but local 
advocacy 
group 
A2 
Safe 

Transport has consistently 
expressed 
frustration 
for 

what it claims is slow progress 
toward pedestrian safety. 

Ramasami 
stressed 

technology as both a “global 
divider and a social leveler.” 
As 
a 
country 
develops 

technologically, 
its 
people 

will be better served, but this 
country will also be set apart 
from the others.

The main problem faced by 

developing countries, according 
to Ramasami, is how to balance 
the need for STI with the cost of 
creating it.

“That’s the crucial problem,” 

Ramasami said. “How much 
should we invest?”

Ramasami’s 
claim 
is 
that 

resource-intensive 
models 
of 

STI are not sustainable. These 
models make it significantly 
more difficult for developing 
countries because they have 
less with which to invest. This 
is why lower- and middle-
income countries tend to invest 
less in STI and research and 
development.

However, Ramasami displayed 

how the geography of STI and 
R&D investment is changing. 
The percentage of investments 
that come from high-income 
countries is less than it used 
to be and the percentage of 
investments of low- and middle-
income countries is on the rise. 
Developing countries in Asia 
are becoming major investors in 
R&D, at about 20 percent of total 
investments.

Thinking 
about 
the 

investments 
of 
developing 

countries 
is 
something 

something 
that 
Rackham 

student Rachel Wallace was 
looking 
forward 
to 
hearing 

Ramasami discuss.

“In the sciences we’re often 

so siloed in our respective 
disciplines and we don’t really 
think about the broader context 

of our work and so for one the 
STPP (science, technology and 
public policy) program really 
opens you up to that,” she said. 
“But then we still largely think 
in a U.S. context and bringing 
Dr. Ramasami in has really 
expanded us to think in a global 
context and think about how 
the work we do impacts not just 
us in the U.S., but also how it 
affects social change in other 

developing places.” 

The next step once a country 

has decided to invest in STI 
is to decide whether to let 
competitiveness or inclusiveness 
guide the process. A competitive 
method would involve “leapfrog 
innovations 
for 
market 

advantages 
and 
returns 
to 

investors and innovators” while 
a more inclusive method would 
involve “incremental and frugal 
innovations for public and social 
good,” according to Ramasami.

Ramasami also made a case 

for 
collaboration 
between 

developing 
and 
developed 

countries. The weaknesses of 
developing countries — a lack 
of resources, for example — can 
be balanced out by developed 
countries and vice versa. 

“Countries with the ability to 

value-maximize and resource-
optimize seem ideal allies for 
strategic alliances,” Ramasami 
said. 
“Countries 
with 
large 

domestic markets could barter 

market access for access to 
innovations. This would call for 
migration from competition to 
collaboration.” 

Ramasami 
used 
his 
own 

country, India, as an example 
for how lower-middle-income 
countries can invest in STI and 
R&D, use an inclusive method, 
and have the potential for 
strategic partnership with a 
more developed country.

India is the only lower-

middle-income 
country 
to 

make the list of top 10 R&D-
investing countries, at number 
six. Out of the total 90 percent 
of investments of low-income 
countries 
and 
lower-middle-

income countries, India’s share 
of 
investments 
exceeds 
89 

percent because many nations 
cannot afford to expend so much 
on R&D. 

Ramasami says this is because 

India uses a bottom-up approach 
that focuses on helping the 
people rather than on getting 
ahead.

“(The) informal and frugal 

innovation sector of India offers 
unique strength for leverage 
in 
the 
global 
un(served) 

and 
underserved 
markets,” 

Ramasami said.

This is the part of his talk that 

Public Policy student Sruthi 
Gaddipati, who is native to 
India, agreed with most.

“In 
countries 
like 
India, 

it’s 
more 
public 
investment 

in research and development 
and 
they 
focus 
on 
what’s 

economically good for the people 
rather than just innovations for 
the rich,” Gaddipati said. “The 
innovations at the grassroot 
level … I’m from India so I’ve 
seen that those innovations are 
there.”

Ramasami’s closing remarks 

echoed that sentiment.

“It 
is 
not 
about 
the 

expenditure; it’s about the value 
it brings to people.”

PARE NTS WE E KE ND


G

rowing up, I always 
envisioned 
myself 

living in a sorority 

house at whatever college I 
ended up attending. For some 
reason, whenever I pictured 
what I would look like years 
down 
the 
road, 
happily 

committed to a university, I 
was always wearing Greek 
letters. To me, not going Greek 
was never an option. It seemed 
like a path everyone in my life 
had gone down and one I was 
willing to take myself.

However, 
this 

complementary 
image 
of 

college and Greek social life 
came crashing down when my 
older sister fell through the 
cracks of the system. Nobody 
decided to stand up for her 
and say, “She would fit in so 
well here!” and I was baffled. 
Rumored 
romances 
swirled 

around her, and unfortunately 
the Greek community truly 
values gossip. She is the most 
upbeat, “Sorority Sally” type 
of girl I know, so if she couldn’t 
thrive in the system, could I? 
Did I even know people who 
would be willing to stand up 
for me?

As a result of my sister’s 

experiences, I went into the 
recruitment process with fresh 
eyes. I could try to discern 
between 
the 
performance 

girls put on during each round 
and who each girl truly was. 
After all, I had to be able to 
feel comfortable living with 
these people. At the end of 
the day, I turned out fine 
and ended up in a house I am 
extremely happy in. The social 
aspect is phenomenal, and the 
philanthropy is an added bonus 
toward loving sorority life.

However, once it was my turn 

to rush girls, I caught a glimpse 

of the side of recruitment I don’t 
like — the side of recruitment 
that took my sister down in a 
tidal wave of judgment. We are 
expected to know, learn and 
love or hate girls in the span of 
20 — yes, 20 — minutes. Young 
girls entering the newest, most 
terrifying period in their lives 
are supposed to know and 
understand “unspoken rules” 
of conversation or socializing in 
order for houses to want them. 

No talk about boys, but if you’re 
comfortable with whom you’re 
talking to, they’ll look past it. 
No discussing parties, but if 
they like you, they’ll let it slide. 
It’s all so confusing because 
how would you truly know if a 
girl likes you or is coercing you 
to break these barriers through 
manipulated 
self-sabotage? 

Rumors like these constantly 
make way between nervous 
potential new members. 

Eighty 
girls 
making 
a 

decision is a nightmare in and of 
itself, and, from the first round, 
cutting girls becomes more and 
more intense. Relationships are 
formed once you begin rushing 
a girl more and more rounds, so 
a protectiveness tends to occur 
when someone tries to cut 
her. Countering opinions flew 

around the room, and these 
thoughts were often greeted 
by subtle jabs. Girls who know 
this potential new member 
from home want to keep her, 
while girls who were rubbed 
the wrong way by her during a 
round try cutting her. While I 
was semi-irritated by the way 
my house preferred some girls 
over others, there were horror 
stories 
swirling 
around 
of 

other houses electing a single 
girl to finalize decisions for 
their entire house.

Though 
Greek 
life 
has 

made me abundantly happy 
at school, it taught me more 
than the regular rules of 
sisterhood. While the process 
is meant to be tough and sort 
girls into houses they would 
be “more comfortable in,” 
I learned that second — or 
even third — chances matter. 
Sometimes first impressions 
can be correct, but most of the 
time, they can be completely 
misleading.

Greek life taught me to be 

more open and gave me the 
opportunity to talk to people 
I never thought I would. To 
face the facts, there are tons 
of negative stereotypes about 
Greek life circulating through 
college 
communities, 
and 

honestly, many of them are 
true. But it takes special people 
to move past these stereotypes 
and make the system their own, 
create the culture they went 
through this process searching 
for. Those are the types of 
people who thrive in the Greek 
life community, and those are 
the people that make being in 
Greek life worth it.

F

or 
individuals 

struggling with mental 
health, everything life 

throws 
at 
them 

during 
college 

doesn’t exactly help.

Maybe 
friends 

pressure me to go 
out, 
but 
saying, 

“I’m sad, I really 
don’t want to,” does 
not feel like a good 
enough 
excuse. 

Thoughts of losing 
out on a memorable 
night 
influence 

me to go out, and when I do 
go, chances are I feel worse. 
Maybe I have a mandatory 
meeting for a club on campus, 
but being sad won’t suffice as 
a good excuse for my group 
leader. And on the off chance 
I say I’m sick, I fear someone 
seeing me on the Diag and 
spreading rumors that I was 
not actually sick. When I email 
my professor for an extension 
for a deadline I could not meet 
because I had too much on my 
mind, he will probably respond 
with my score: a zero. 

The 
implications 

surrounding mental health on 
campus limit our conversations 
surrounding this issue. As 
students, 
we 
think 
school 

comes before everything. We 
are not taught to take a “mental 
health day.” It is only when 
we are physically unwell that 
we believe it is acceptable to 
miss a class or a deadline. The 
stigma we put on mental health 
as bystanders, sufferers and 
friends prevents us from openly 
discussing the topic and taking 
advantage of the few resources 
(that are already over capacity) 
available on campus.

For many students, mental 

health is compromised during 
their time at the University of 
Michigan, and often mental 
unwellness 
is 
exacerbated 

during stressful periods of the 
school year. We are constantly 
taught throughout our lives 

by 
our 
professors, 
parents 

and friends that we need to 
be cognizant of the mental 

health conditions of 
others. But we aren’t 
taught how to talk a 
roommate 
through 

a breakdown or how 
to stand up for our 
classmates who are 
dealing with mental 
illness.

Mental 
health 

is something that 
is 
different 
for 

each 
individual. 

Recognizing these differences 
is essential when conversing 
with a friend in crisis and 
making 
them 
feel 
OK 
to 

pour it all out. Some people 
never experience the anxiety, 
depression or other ailments 
that others have to deal with 
every day. When a classmate or 
friend is clearly upset and going 
through a lot, the common 
response from bystanders is 
“that sucks; I’m so sorry.”

Though this is clearly not 

what 
the 
suffering 
person 

needs to hear, I often find 
myself at a loss for words when 
someone tells me about all the 
bad things that are happening 
to them. There is no way to 
know how these experiences 
directly affect them or what 
is going through their head 
or how they feel in that exact 

moment. Everyone experiences 
hardship so differently that we 
cannot assume anything about 
anyone else, and that’s what 
makes this issue so hard to 
deal with.

As someone who struggles 

with anxiety, it is hard to let 
people in on what is really going 
on in my mind. What might not 
seem like a huge deal for one 
individual can be immensely 
different for another. To make 
it worse, being thousands of 
miles away from your family 
and constantly surrounded by 
strangers does not exactly make 
for a welcoming environment.

I 
have 
found 
several 

resources that discuss how 
to go about talking to a peer 
about their symptoms, but 
the results were inconclusive. 
And what if these formulaic 
steps don’t work? We all 
take things differently, and 
a cookie-cutter plan to make 
someone feel comforted in a 
stressful situation does not 
always 
work. 
Spontaneity 

is important, and catering 
to an individual’s needs is 
essential in making them 
feel trusted and welcomed 
confiding in you.

Mental health is even more 

essential to our growth as 
individuals because, without it, 
we are constantly in a state of 
discontent that is unproductive. 
As university students, we need 
to recognize that we all have 
moments of stress, despair and 
anxiety. Though we might not 
experience these things in the 
same way, it is important to 
validate the feelings of others 
and to let them know they are 
not alone. It is OK to voice the 
issues with mental health in 
society. This will allow us to 
come together and beat the 
stigma surrounding this valid 
illness, so we can all get the 
resources we need.

Ann Arbor: a vegan dystopia?

LEVI TEITEL | COLUMN

I 

am no fan of cold weather. 
In fact, I detest the very 
notion 
of 
winter. 
The 

inclement weather we have 
been graced with after a hot 
autumn has not fared well for 
me. In light of the rapid seasonal 
change, my body was not ready 
to handle snow Oct. 31. So, I 
have taken to my favorite coping 
mechanism to get over the 
winter blues: eating.

This week I walked from 

North 
Quad 
Residence 

Hall to Kerrytown, where I 
braved the wind and drizzle 
to meet an old friend at one 
of my favorite Ann Arbor 
establishments: 
The 
Lunch 

Room. Not only is The Lunch 
Room a fantastic restaurant, 
but it also happens to be a 
fantastic 
vegan 
restaurant, 

if you could ever fathom that 
(perceived) oxymoron.

Being a vegan in Ann Arbor, 

or anywhere for that matter, 
is 
extremely 
difficult. 
As 

a pescatarian of five years 
and a vegan for almost a full 
calendar year, I do my absolute 
best to meander through the 
complexities of the Ann Arbor 
restaurant scene with variable 
success. While greater Ann 
Arbor maintains a host of 
vegan fare, I feel unfulfilled. 
Why are there so many options 
that leave me unsatisfied? The 
combination of my unusual 
personal preferences and the 
inaccessibility of Ann Arbor 
vegan victuals makes for an 
unfortunate evening ritual for 
my own sake.

The geographic distribution 

of vegan restaurants in Ann 
Arbor is heavily concentrated. 
The bulk exist near Main 
Street and north of Central 
Campus, which is limiting 
to many students, including 
myself. 
Inconvenienced 
by 

the lack of options on Central 
Campus, where are students to 
go? As it turns out, we are not 
left with much.

While 
I 
have 
previously 

written on the waning status 
of student neighborhoods, the 
same argument extends to where 
students can grab a bite to eat. 
As I expressed in my previous 
column regarding the changing 
nature 
of 
city 
storefronts, 

the major intersection near 
my home (Packard and South 
State 
streets) 
has 
changed 

considerably over the past few 
years as restaurants come and 
go. Moreover, finding a wide 
variety of places to eat in just 
a few steps’ reach is incredibly 
difficult. This distance will 
only get more difficult when 
snow begins to cover the streets 
and sidewalks.

The options I have near my 

home consist of the following: 
cheese and bread, more cheese 
and 
bread, 
and 
barbecue 

chicken. This is not to say that 
you can’t even find one thing on 
the menu that would count as 
remotely vegan in some of these 
restaurants, such as a black 
bean burger. However, given 
the limited options, I am usually 
stuck with frequenting the same 
exact restaurants week after 
week, eventually running out 
of options and coming to abhor 
this repetitive routine.

Ann 
Arbor 
is 
also 

oversaturated with restaurants 
outside of the budget range of 
most college students, and this 
phenomenon is not just limited 
to vegan restaurants. However, 
because most vegan restaurants 
tend to be located near Main 

Street, they can charge whatever 
pedestrians there can afford.

Maybe I am just a picky 

eater with a skinny wallet. But 
besides limiting my diet to only 
plants, I am pretty much willing 
to try any type of cuisine or 
dish. And while there are many 
restaurants in Ann Arbor, I still 
need to spend as much time 
finding a restaurant on Yelp as it 
would take to actually have the 
meal I have not yet eaten.

I sometimes find it easier to 

schlep outside of town or even to 
Ypsilanti to find a more casual 
and as enjoyable restaurant 
experience. Plus, going outside 
of town can provide a more 
unique selection of places given 
the amount of foreign food that 
is not as prevalent within Ann 
Arbor. Of course, the extra gas 
it takes to leave town may not 
be as economical as just staying 
at one of the more upscale Ann 
Arbor 
restaurants. 
What 
a 

predicament.

Because of the difficulties 

I run into finding an ideal 
restaurant, I do much of my 
cooking at home. My at-home 
eating habits are not at all a 
detriment; if anything, it is 
a good thing to not have to 
spend money outside the home 
unnecessarily. 
However, 
it 

would be nice if I could stop 
on my way home after a long 
day of class to carry something 
out without having to worry 
so much about my distinct 
stipulations.

I just got a winter jacket 

today, so I am well prepared to 
brave the winter snow in order

When everything sucks, 
LCD Soundsystem rocks

As the clever hopes expire of 

a low dishonest decade, there 
are still fleeting moments 
of unfettered joy. That is to 
say, when everything else is 
bad, LCD Soundsystem’s live 
show will still be really, really 
good. It’s the kind of good that 
preserves itself in amber and 
makes a home in the deepest 
chambers of your heart.

But, of course, this isn’t 

the band’s first time around 
the block. The last time they 
played in Detroit they were at 
the Fillmore, around the block 
(and over a couple streets) 
from the Masonic Temple, 
where they set up shop this 
past weekend for two nights of 
dancing, joy and — naturally — 
a little nostalgia. 

The 
initial 
reservations 

that came with the band’s 
unexpected reunion were that 
the illusion of immortality that 
accompanies 
a 
resurrection 

would undermine the urgency 
their sound was built upon. 
The worry was that when they 
closed their set — as they always 
have and probably always will 
— singing, “This could be the 
last time,” it wouldn’t mean 
anything anymore.

While I’d like to affix my 

badge of unrelenting faith 
and say I never worried: I did. 

But, my worries were proven 
absurd last weekend when LCD 
Soundsystem, as deep down I 
knew they would, gave two of 
the greatest live performances 
I might ever be lucky enough 
to see.

There 
was 
a 
moment 

on 
Friday 
night, 
between 

“You 
Wanted 
a 
Hit” 
and 

“Tribulations,” where James 
Murphy looked back at Nancy 
Whang and the two seemed to 
share a quick moment of awe. 
The thrill of their reunion, 
the illicit audacity of it, hasn’t 
worn off yet. 

That energy translated to 

the crowd, who pulsed with 
expectant energy hours before 
Murphy and company took 
the stage. And as soon as they 
did, opening Friday night with 
american dream opener “Oh 
Baby” and Saturday with “Us v. 
Them,” the room exploded.

They still maintain all the 

trappings — Murphy’s bullet 
microphone, 
his 
periodic 

assent of an amp, calculated 
(yet 
seamless) 
mid-song 

instrument rearrangements — 
that define them as singular 
both in sound and presentation. 
No one can throw a party like 
James Murphy because no one 
would probably plan a party as 
meticulously as James Murphy.

The 
set 
wound 
it’s 

way 
through 
the 
band’s 

discography, 
hitting 
classic 

concert 
highlights 
like 

“Movement” 
and 
“Get 

Innocuous!” which inspired 
a small group of punk kids to 
open up a humble pit.

Their first stop in Detroit 

since the release of american 
dream 
in 
September, 
the 

show was an introduction to 
the 
performance-enhanced 

nuances of tracks like “tonite” 
and “call the police.” A bop 
on 
headphones, 
“tonite” 

is 
elevated 
to 
dance-punk 

platinum live.

Before 
their 
post-“pee 

break” encore, Nancy Whang 
took over lead vocals for a 
cover of Chic’s “I Want Your 
Love” and the band left us with 
a haunting rendition of Sound 
of Silver tearjerker “New York, 
I Love You But You’re Bringing 
Me Down,” before coming back 
for a encore trilogy of hits. 

An album and six years older, 

LCD 
Soundsystem 
haven’t 

lost any of their spark. They 
matched the crowd beat for 
beat, feeding off our rhythm 
as we danced to the one they 
created. Which is all to say: 
They still rock. 

Maybe 
the 
more 
things 

change, the more they stay 
the same. All I know is, LCD 
Soundsystem is always going 
to close with “All My Friends” 
and every time it’s going to lift 
me up and put me back down 
again restored, reenergized 
and re-in love with my friends. 
And sometimes that’s all the 
stability I need.

ARTIST INTERVIEW
A conversation with Cloud 
Nothings’s Dylan Baldi

Earlier this year, I had the 

pleasure of witnessing Cloud 
Nothings headline El Club in 
support of their most recent 
album, 
Life 
Without 
Sound. 

Over the course of their career, 
Cloud Nothings has continued 
to grow and flourish by existing 
in the gray area between indie 
rock and punk, never quite 
committing to one genre over 
the other. What results is a 
group of musicians with a knack 
for energetic shows and a tight, 
clean sound.

The band played at The 

Majestic Theater in Detroit 
opening for Canada’s own indie 
rock gems Japandroids, a match 
made in heaven between two of 
modern rock’s catchiest groups.

In 
a 
phone 
conversation 

with frontman Dylan Baldi, we 
talked about the band’s recent 
experiences on tour opening 
for Japandroids, the growth 
of Cloud Nothings since its 
inception and future plans for 
the band.

The Michigan Daily: Could 

you reflect on your experiences 
touring with Japandroids thus 
far?

Dylan Baldi: Sure. We were 

in Canada for most of (the first 
week), through a lot of Canada 
I’ve never been to. So it’s been 
kind of fun going through 
there. Touring through parts 
of the country that I’ve never 

even thought about going to. 
Just seeing what’s it’s like for a 
Canadian band to do that all the 
time, and thinking about how it 
can be really kind of taxing to 
make really long drives through 
what feels like the middle of 
nowhere, and just tour Canada 
all the time. It was interesting to 
get that perspective of touring 
through a different country. 
And the tour’s been fun.

TMD: Do you see a lot of 

overlap with your fans and 
Japandroids’ fans or do you 
think you’ve been reaching a 
new fanbase on this tour?

Baldi: I think a lot of the 

people who come to the shows 
are there specifically to see 
Japandroids. 
We 
get 
some 

people who are there to see us 
for sure, but it does feel like 
they’re 
Japandroids’ 
shows, 

which is cool. I think a lot of 
their fans may not know who 
we are, so it’s kind of fun to play 
for people who don’t know who 
you are every night. It makes the 
shows interesting, where you 
can never really tell what people 
are thinking.

TMD: How do you feel the 

crowds have been reacting to 
your sets compared to your last 
headlining tour?

Baldi: Pretty good. There’s 

like a little pocket of people. 
Usually you can tell when people 
know the songs, so those people 
have been going crazy. Everyone 
seems into it, you know. Nobody 
seems bored or anything. And 
we’re selling all sorts of t-shirts 
so somebody likes it.

TMD: Now that Life Without 

Sound is a few months away 
from being a year old, could you 
tell me how you think Cloud 
Nothings has grown since you 
first started?

Baldi: We’ve just become 

more and more — I just did 
another 
interview 
actually 

where I kind of said something 
similar — but it’s almost like 
a telepathic unit at this point. 
Where like we’ll have little parts 
in the songs that we’ll change 
every night or something, but 
none of us will talk about it 
or say like “We should do this 
differently!” It’ll just sort of 
happen on its own. We’ll be like 
“Oh, interesting, how did we do 
that without talking about it?” 
That’s something we probably 
couldn’t have done seven years 
ago whenever the band first 
started. Just little moments 
like that have definitely grown 
throughout time and been more 
fun to kind of naturally see what 
happens. We’re just a better 
band than we were when we 
started.

TMD: I know tour is a busy 

time, but do you have plans for 
a new Cloud Nothings record in 
the near future?

Baldi: I want to get something 

next year. That would be the 
goal for me, because we put this 
record out, we toured it, and 
now we’re done. It seems like it’s 
already time to get something 
new out there and try to have a 
reason to go back on tour rather 
than just play the same old songs 
again.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Local poet Cal Freeman 
brings flair to advocacy

Established local poet and 

critic Cal Freeman is bringing 
his new work, “Fight Songs,” 
to Literati Bookstore. Freeman 
uses rustic imagery to convey 
themes of social advocacy as 
he simultaneously, lyrically 
describes the struggle of the 
working class in Southeast 
Michigan.

“Fight Songs” 

is a collection of 
poems that deals 
with 
themes 

of 
social 
and 

ecological justice 
and 
politics. 

From 
a 
young 

age, 
Freeman 

was 
interested 

in 
the 
ecology 

of 
Southeast 

Michigan, which 
is 
where 
he 

grew up. His poems explore 
the geography of Southeast 
Michigan in the context of 
the social struggles of the 
working 
class. 
Although 

Freeman was not part of a 
working class family, he lived 
around working class families 
his entire life. He offers an 
insider’s view of the struggle 
that 
many 
working 
class 

families 
meet, 
connecting 

them 
to 
the 
ecological 

struggles that exist on the 
Michigan terrain.

“I am just telling stories of 

people and places I know,” 
said Freeman in an interview 
with the Daily. He sees social 
justice 
and 
environmental 

justice going hand-in-hand. At 
face value, many of Freeman’s 
poems may seem like an ode 
to 
the 
natural 
landscape 

of Michigan. If one reads 
between the lines, however, 
powerful statements of social 
injustice are being made.

Freeman, who reviews the 

work of other poets for the 
radio show “Stateside,” on 
Michigan 
Public 
Radio, 
is 

highly influenced by other 
local poets. Through constant 
exposure 
to 
the 
poetic 

experiments being conducted 
by other local poets Freeman is 
inspired to take risks and shake 
conventions. Additionally, his 
poetry is highly influenced 
by confessional poets such as 
Anne Sexton. The poems in 

“Fight 
Songs” 

resemble journal 
entries, 
yet 

these 
personal 

anecdotes 
have 
clout 
in 

the 
broader 

Michigan 
community.

“I 
try 
to 

go 
more 
for 

experience, 
something 
the 

reader 
can 
get 

invested 
in,” 

Freeman 
said. 
He 
invites 

us to be invested in his own 
mind, articulating his own 
perception on the challenges 
of the working class and the 
current 
environmental 
and 

political states of Southeast 
Michigan.

The book contains elegies 

and odes to the deceased 
members of the Southeast 
Michigan community, whether 
he knew them personally or 
not. Freeman is most proud 
of his poem, “Dearborn,” in 
which he exposes the uncut 
history of his home state and 
vilifies the traditional heroes 
of his neighborhood, most 
notably Henry Ford. The poem 
is the elegy to a young man 
named Kevin Matthews, a 
man with schizophrenia who 
was murdered by an off-duty 
police officer. Freeman, in 
his typical fashion, presents 
natural images that evoke 
the rugged Michigan terrain, 

exposing the dark past of his 
hometown’s hero, Henry Ford, 
and exploring the murder of 
the young Matthews. This 
narrative brings the reader 
into 
the 
deep 
history 
of 

Dearborn, as well as its natural 
landscape.

Freeman’s 
poetry 
speaks 

to local Michiganders, but 
he hopes hopes that it speaks 
to a larger audience as well. 
Freeman 
said 
he 
wants 

his 
work 
to 
“complicate 

(Michigan) in people’s minds.” 
There are many who have 
not experienced the social 
injustices 
that 
plague 
the 

working class or the raw nature 
scenes of Michigan. He hopes 
that Michigan is now thought 
of as more than just a state that 

produces cars and Motown, 
but as a place of complexity. 
Freeman is excited to share 
his work with Ann Arbor, 
bringing awareness to social 
issues that have been ignored 
for a long time in the Michigan 
community and creating a 
space of vulnerability and 
confession.

THE CW

The case for ‘Riverdale’ 
and other ‘trash television’

When I watch the CW’s 

“Riverdale,” 
two 
thoughts 

come to mind: One, this show 
is horrible and two, I can’t stop 
watching it. As an updated, 
mystery-filled adaptation of 
the Archie comics, “Riverdale” 
makes for equally fantastic and 
absurd entertainment. Coming 
to terms with this paradox 
made me want to explore how 
“Riverdale” became such a 
phenomenon and why it’s an 
example of modern day trash 
TV.

Trash TV, by definition, 

refers 
to 
a 
subgenre 
of 

television with a focus on 
controversy and confrontation. 
The term is often associated 
with tabloid talk shows that 
play on miniature TV sets in 
doctor’s offices or at the DMV: 
“Dr. Phil,” “Judge Judy,” “The 
Jerry Springer Show,” you get 
the idea. But more recently, 
the connotation of trash TV 
has 
broadened 
to 
include 

any show, tabloid or not, that 
sensationalizes and exploits 
violence, profanity and nudity 
as spectacle. Essentially, a 
trash TV show is considered so 
awful, you can’t look away.

This definition has found 

its way into more reality-
based shows like ABC’s “The 
Bachelor” and its spinoff, “The 
Bachelorette.” Both programs 
illuminate the worst parts of 
human relationships through 
a dating competition show, 
where one lucky hot person 
must decide whom to marry 
among a selection of 25 other 
hot people. Despite critical 
ire, “The Bachelor” and “The 
Bachelorette” have been met 
with commercial success since 
their premieres in 2002 and 
2003, respectively. Other iconic 
trash TV shows like MTV’s 
“Jersey 
Shore” 
and 
“Teen 

Mom” have also encountered 
similar 
prosperity 
during 

their runs, attracting loads 
of viewers for their tasteless 
portrayals of American life. 
Even though they weren’t the 
most 
sympathetic 
subjects, 

douchey club-goers from New 

Jersey and pregnant teenagers 
from rural American towns 
made for great television.

How, then, does “Riverdale” 

fit into the trash TV mold? For 
starters, “Riverdale” is a hot 
mess. It has the melodramatic, 
mawkish appeal of a daytime 
soap and the contrived acting 
of a teen after-school special. 
The show also lacks compelling 
writing, 
with 
characters 

mustering up excessive pop 
cultural references that are 
way too obscure, cheesy and 
confusing for its own good. 
“Can’t we, in this post-James 
Franco 
world, 
just 
be 
all 

things?” was a legitimate line 
of dialogue from the pilot — let 
that sink in. The characters 
themselves, 
unfortunately, 

don’t do any justice for the 
script either, resembling far-
fetched, 
one-dimensional 

caricatures straight out of 
a campy musical about high 
school (no disrespect to “High 
School Musical”). Even though 
“Riverdale” may not embody 
the typical traits of a trash TV 
show, it certainly embodies a 
trashy, cringe-inducing ethos. 

Along 
with 
exemplifying 

the spirit of the trash TV 
show, “Riverdale” also gets 
an extra boost from its online 
popularity. According to a 
Vulture article, the streaming 
platform may have had a role 
in 
“Riverdale”’s 
continuing 

success when the first season 
was made available on the 
streaming platform. There is 
plausibility to that argument: 
“Riverdale”’s second season, 
which 
premiered 
on 
Oct. 

11, reached a ratings high, 
peaking at 2.34 million in the 
first episode.

And “Riverdale” isn’t the 

only serialized TV show that 
has capitalized on their trashy 
appeal 
through 
an 
online 

presence. Back in 2012, Spike 
TV’s “Blue Mountain State” 
drew a heavy cult following 
once its first three seasons 
made its way to Netflix. The 
show 
depicted 
a 
fictitious 

college 
football 
team 
that 

indulged 
heavily 
in 
the 

stereotypical, 
over-stylized 

luxuries of American college 
life. For devoted fans, the 
insane binge drinking, toxic 

masculinity 
and 
objectified 

female 
characters 
inherent 

in “BMS” made the show 
both 
relentlessly 
amusing 

and 
wildly 
idiotic. 
The 

show’s growing, post-mortem 
fanbase was enough to ignite 
a Kickstarter campaign for a 
“BMS” movie that reached its 
goal of $1.5 million. Perhaps 
trash TV deserves more merit 
than we give it.

Of 
course, 
“Riverdale” 

isn’t 
without 
its 
perks. 

Underneath its flashy murder 
mystery plot, the show has a 
charming, diverse cast, stylish 
production values and tight 
structuring. Like other teen 
dramas, “Riverdale” discusses 
topical themes, such as mental 
illness, sexuality, the strains 
of 
friendship 
and 
family 

dynamics, 
with 
surprising 

nuance. Though most of the 
characters 
aren’t 
exactly 

A-level complex, “Riverdale” 
makes a concerted effort to 
develop their arcs. And during 
some of its most climactic 
moments, 
“Riverdale” 

understands how laughable the 
drama can get.

Cole Sprouse (“Suite Life 

on Deck”) exemplifies some of 
“Riverdale”’s best and worst 
traits 
as 
the 
introspective 

Jughead Jones, playing his 
role with an equal amount 
of 
grating 
self-seriousness 

and sly self-awareness. One 
of his most infamous scenes, 
which involves telling Betty 
(Lili Reinhart, “The Kings of 
Summer”) that he’s a weirdo, 
has 
spawned 
numerous 

scathing responses. At the same 
time, it has also become one of 
the most memorable, defining 
moments 
in 
“Riverdale”’s 

first season, enough to spark 
momentum and conversation 
among fans and non-fans of 
the show.

To be clear, “trash TV” isn’t 

just bad TV that gets good 
ratings (looking at you, “The 
Big Bang Theory”). It’s the type 
of “so-bad-it’s-good” show that 
breeds its own intense, devoted 
fandom, 
whose 
presence 

becomes so powerful that it 
develops into a cult following. 
People watch trash TV not 
just because it is so ineffably 
entertaining, but also because 

it inadvertently forms its 
own community. Watching 
a crappy TV show like “The 
Bachelor” with a group of 
people seems just as common 
nowadays as watching an 
acclaimed 
TV 
show 
like 

“Games of Thrones.” Trash 
TV remains a relevant staple 
in modern day entertainment, 
even in the age of so-called 
prestige television. Whether 
you love to hate “Riverdale” 
or hate to love it, it’s a show 
that subverts the dominant 
standard 
of 
quality 
TV. 

Depending on your taste, 
maybe that’s something we 
can all get behind.

‘Mom’ season premiere 
brings comedy, advocacy

In a world where laptops 

take the place of television 
sets and cellphone companies 
produce 
well-founded 
and 

popular entertainment (yes, 
really, just look at AT&T), it 
is easy to forget that quality 
television is still available on 
the classic broadcast networks 
we all used to love so dearly.

Entering its fifth season, 

“Mom” continues 
to stay true to 
its 
foundation, 

delivering sharp, 
if not sometimes 
slapstick, 
comedy 
while 

also confronting 
difficult 
questions 
about 

relationships, addiction and 
moving forward after hitting 
rock bottom. The fourth season 
ended with Christy (Anna 
Faris, “The Emoji Movie”) 
representing 
her 
mother 

Bonnie (Allison Janney, “Sun 
Dogs”) after she was tracked 
down by the IRS for $18,000 
worth of unpaid taxes. Now 
in the fifth season opener, 
Christy is studying for the 
LSATs as her mother struggles 
with a fear of commitment 
after her boyfriend, Adam 
(William 
Fichtner, 
“Hot 

Summer Nights”), proposes.

Within just this episode, 

both 
main 
and 
secondary 

characters 
demonstrate 
the 

difficulty of putting your life 
back together after a misstep 
or two. Bonnie wonders if she’ll 
be able to handle a marriage 
the way she has learned to 
handle her alcoholism. Christy 
prepares for law school after 
years of wrestling self-doubt 
and addiction. Her friend, 
Natasha (Missi Pyle, “Highly 

Functional”), looks for a job 
so she can get her child out of 
foster care, even though the 
only thing she’s ever done for 
money is strip and sell drugs. 
These are storylines that you 
wouldn’t expect to go hand-
in-hand with a laughing studio 
audience 
and 
jokes 
about 

G-spots, but after five seasons, 
“Mom”’s methods continue to 
be effective.

One 
particular 
stand-out 

moment in the premiere was 
when Adam first proposed 
to Bonnie. In a span of thirty 

seconds, 
you 

watch 
Bonnie 

spiral 
from 

complete 
joy 

to 
utter 
panic, 

ultimately 
sprinting 
away 

from her lover. 

In between the comedic banter 
and a joke about Bonnie’s 
inability to make meatloaf, the 
classic housewife dish, viewers 
are shown a woman still facing 
the mistakes of her past and 
grappling with the idea that 
she may not be good enough to 
truly be loved.

It is work that is clearly 

Emmy-worthy, and in fact the 
show has won quite a few of 
the golden statues, but this 
year something changed. Back 
in May, the producers and 
stars of “Mom” announced 
that they would be donating 
the show’s $250,000 Emmy 
campaign budget to Planned 
Parenthood. Allison Janney 
and series co-creator Chuck 
Lorre announced the effort 
amid President Trump and 
the Republican’s plan to push 
the American Health Care Act 
through Congress, a bill which 
would have detrimental effects 
on the work of the women’s 
health organization.

The move was reminiscent 

of a similar act by the United 

Talent 
Agency, 
which 

canceled 
its 
traditional 

Oscar party in February to 
protest Trump’s views and 
policy on immigration. While 
deeply 
political 
in 
nature, 

both “Mom”’s donation and 
UTA’s 
cancellation 
send 
a 

clear message not just to our 
elected officials but to the 
entertainment industry as a 
whole: It has a responsibility to 
speak up against injustice.

Movies, 
music, 
television 

shows and everything else we 
consume through screens and 
earbuds are meant to serve 
as distractions from reality. 
But in a culture where so 
many Americans and others 
worldwide are feeling targeted 
and unsafe, to ignore the 
problem is to submit to it. There 
are things in this world more 
important than praise and 
recognition, and it’s about time 
more people in entertainment 
learn that. If a television show 
wants to remain relevant and 
beloved, the people involved in 
making it should be ensuring 
their viewers that they care 
about them and are willing to 
use their platform to fight for 
them.

“Mom” has fallen on the 

good side of the fight, not just 
exploiting the story of a young 
mother for entertainment, but 
actually providing funds to an 
organization that will fight for 
that young mother once the TV 
is turned off. It’s a shame that 
we must rely on pop culture 
to act in the humane way our 
president fails to, but as group 
after group is marginalized by 
the people this country has put 
into power, somebody has to 
start making sacrifices so that 
we as a society can get better. 
And who better for that job 
than a mom?

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
UMS’s CrossCurrents and 
its display of fusion music

Growing up in an Indian 

household, 
Zakir 
Hussain 

has always been a household 
name for me. I’ve listened to 
his music crackle out from the 
boombox in our kitchen, the 
sounds of the tabla resounding 
off the walls. I’ve danced 
Kathak, a traditional form of 
Indian classical dance, to his 
compositions and have been 
astounded with the speed that 
is necessary to keep up with 
his 
tempo. 
Understandably, 

when I heard Zakir Hussain 
was coming to Ann Arbor with 
his band CrossCurrents, I was 
stoked.

Hussain is widely recognized 

as one of the most influential 
musicians of our time. Born 
in Mumbai, India, Hussain 
is 
treasured 
worldwide 
as 

a maestro player of tabla, a 
traditional 
type 
of 
Indian 

drum played with the hands. 
CrossCurrents, 
Hussain’s 

latest endeavour, is a blend 

between classical Indian music 
and Western jazz. His band is 
composed of a stunning array 
of musicians: the revered bass 
player Dave Holland, known 
for his large contribution to 
jazz, and Shankar Mahadevan, 
one of the top vocalists to 
come out of India in the last 
two decades. Others include 
leading saxophone player Chris 
Potter, the “Godfather of Indian 
Jazz” Louiz Banks on keyboard, 
Sanjay Divecha on guitar and 
Gino Banks on drums.

CrossCurrents capitalizes on 

the high level of improvisation 
in both Indian classical music 
and jazz, blending the two 
styles together to create a new 
and unique sound. To all those 
who are skeptical, rest assured, 
CrossCurrents 
seamlessly 

switched from Indian classical 
to jazz in a way that was fresh 
and exhilarating.

The band walked out to a 

full audience in the Michigan 
Theater on Wednesday evening, 
and everyone whooped and 
hollered when Hussain entered 
and bowed to the audience with 

his palms pressed together, an 
Indian gesture of greeting and 
respect. Dave Holland dressed 
in 
a 
kurtha, 
a 
traditional 

Indian garment worn by males, 
and the audience chuckled in 
admiration. With full smiles on 
their faces, they started to play.

The first piece started with 

the tabla and sax, a contrast 
that jarred the audience at first 
but slowly won their awe. The 
sharp, ringing sound of the 
sax contrasted greatly with 
the mellow, deep tabla, yet 
both complimented each other 
perfectly. Hussain fed off the 
sax’s leads, maintaining eye 
contact and following his pace 
the whole time. Gradually, the 
other instruments joined in, 
some tentatively and others 
loudly. CrossCurrents’ sound 
could be described as intervals 
of all the instruments playing 
together with random breaks 
for a rapid tabla sequence or 
sax solo. The effect was nothing 
short of beautiful.

NCAA “Bracket Buster”

NCAA Final Four


It’s time to go dancing

J

illian Dunston leaves no 
doubt.

It’s Media Day at Crisler 

Center and the senior forward 
is taking questions. The one at 
hand: Tournament or bust?

“Exactly.”
Dunston has yet to play in 

the NCAA Tournament. Ditto 
for guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty, the 
most talented 
scorer ever 
to put on a 
Wolverine 
uniform. And 
if neither of 
Michigan’s 
two seniors 
have gotten 
there, it’s not 
hard to figure out that none of 
the other nine members of the 
women’s basketball team have 
either.

The Wolverines haven’t 

danced since the 2012-13 season, 
Kim Barnes Arico’s first as head 
coach. But this is their best 
chance to do so since then.

Of course, so was last season. 

Michigan went 22-9 in the 
regular season with an 11-5 
mark in the Big Ten. It spent 
time in the AP Top 25, staying 
in the polls until late in the 
year. Even after losing three of 
their last four regular season 
games and getting bounced 
in the first round of the Big 
Ten Tournament by Michigan 
State, the Wolverines thought 
they had earned a bid to March 
Madness.

They didn’t.
Heartbreak came on March 

13, when ESPN’s selection 
show came and went without 
Michigan’s name getting 
called. Instead of the NCAA 
Tournament, the Wolverines 
went to the Women’s National 
Invitation Tournament for the 
third consecutive year.

Michigan went on to win the 

WNIT. They’ll raise the banner 
before Friday’s opener against 
George Mason, the first banner 
any women’s basketball team 
will put up at Crisler Center. But 
let’s be clear; that isn’t enough.

The bar for success this year 

is simple: get to the tournament.

There’s no doubt this team 

has enough talent to do it. 
Flaherty is back and set to 
become the program’s all-time 

leading scorer. She averaged 
18.9 points per game last year 
on 38.1 percent shooting from 
beyond the arc, then went home 
this summer and learned how 
to run point. That’s where she’ll 
start this year, and even with 
the potential for growing pains, 
it’s hard to believe Flaherty 
won’t earn a nod to the All-Big 
Ten first team for the third 
straight year.

“The game has slowed down 

for her,” Barnes Arico said on 
Oct 27. “And a lot of times as 
freshmen, you know, it’s so fast. 
And sophomores it becomes a 
little bit slower, juniors it starts 
to click. She’s a senior for us 
now and everything is clicking 
for her.”

Along with Flaherty, junior 

center Hallie Thome – named to 
the preseason All-Big Ten team 
in both the coaches and media 
polls – will provide the bulk of 
the scoring. Junior shooting 
guard Nicole Munger is a threat 
from outside as well, shooting 
42 percent from three last 
season.

But the Wolverines are more 

than three players. If Dunston 
was a football player, she’d win 
the Gruden Grinder award every 
week and sophomore Kayla 
Robbins looks like her natural 
successor. (Ironically enough, 
Robbins’ father, Kevin, played in 
the NFL for three seasons).

Freshmen Hailey Brown 

and Deja Church look ready to 
contribute in big ways as well. 
Brown went for 10 points and 
seven boards in the Wolverines’ 
exhibition game against Grand 
Valley State. As for Church, we 
saw what Barnes Arico meant 
when she said the freshman 
could be one of the best 
defenders in the league: a flying 
transition block, two steals, and 
strong defense throughout.

The only issue from the 

exhibition was depth. Michigan 
went with a seven-woman 
rotation and that strain could 
eventually take a toll, even if 
the Wolverines manage to stay 
healthy.

There’s also the potential 

struggle of replacing point 
guard Siera Thompson. 
Flaherty looked good against 

Grand Valley State, but that 
was a Division II school in an 
exhibition game – not the best 
parallel to Big Ten competition. 
Chances are she will struggle 
eventually. Flaherty herself 
more or less acknowledged this 
on Media Day.

“(At point guard), you don’t 

have to be good skill-wise, you 
have to know the game well,” 
she said. “You have to know 
where to put your players and 
know what plays to run. I think 
that’s something that’s harder 
for me: trying to think on the 
fly.”

Church and Brown won’t 

instantly be All-Americans 
either. They’re freshmen, after 
all, and it takes time to learn 
the college game, let alone build 
chemistry with a new team. 
The team’s trip to Italy over 
the summer was useful in that 
area, particularly for Church, 
who pointed to it as a moment 
where her confidence grew. But 
continuity doesn’t just happen 
– it takes time to build and not 
an insignificant amount of time 
at that.

This team isn’t perfect. It 

likely won’t win the Big Ten 
and expecting any team in the 
country other than UConn to 
win a national title is a fool’s 
errand. But the Wolverines 
don’t have to do either of those 
things. They just have to make 
the tournament – and that they 
can do.

The talent is there. So is the 

motivation.

When the WNIT banner is 

raised on Monday, Michigan 
will remember its triple-
overtime triumph over Georgia 
Tech in the tournament’s 
final. It should also remember 
selection night: the broken 
hearts and the cold reality 
that – at least in the eyes of 
the committee – it wasn’t good 
enough.

This year is about one thing 

for the Wolverines: making sure 
that scene doesn’t repeat itself. 
It’s tournament or bust. Simple 
as that.

Jillian Dunston: The unsung hero

‘Coach, they made a mistake.’ 
At the Michigan women’s basketball 

team’s Media Day, coach Kim Barnes 
Arico reminisced about the day after 
her team wasn’t selected to the 2017 
NCAA Tournament. As the players 
circled up before practice, with tears 
in their eyes, Jillian Dunston made one 
thing clear – the Wolverines should’ve 
been included in March Madness.

But the then-junior knew their 

season wasn’t over and that there was 
still work to be done.

“It’s our job to go out to prove to 

everyone in the world that they made 
a mistake,” Barnes Arico recalls 
Dunston saying. “Michigan is one 
of the best teams in the country. We 

should be represented in the NCAA 
Tournament.”

Under the leadership of Dunston, 

the Wolverines went into the Women’s 
National 
Invitation 
Tournament 

with a chip on their shoulders. That 
mentality carried them throughout 
the competition. Michigan won six 
straight games – including a triple-
overtime win in the finals over Georgia 
Tech – to claim the program’s first ever 
WNIT title.

“Not 
being 
selected 
to 
the 

tournament 
was 
heartbreaking,” 

Dunston remembers. “To think that 
our year was in the power of a few 
peoples’ hands, and they just tossed it 
like that was crazy.”

And with a smile on her face, 

Dunston is quick to point out that 
proving the tournament committee 

wrong and playing a role in winning 
the WNIT Championship is the 
highlight of her career. But finding her 
role wasn’t always easy.

Highly recruited players such as 

Dunston were used to being the go-to 
players – they expect to be the one 
scoring the ball. That’s not Dunston. 
She’s the one doing the little things.

***

Playing at Academy of the Holy 

Cross in Silver Spring, Md., Dunston 
was a highly-touted recruit – ranked 
by ESPN.com as the No. 24 small 
forward nationwide and by ASGR as 
the No. 98 overall prospect. Given 
her achievements in high school, a 
successful career at the college level 
seemed likely. But for Dunston, it took 
time to develop.

As a freshman, Dunston didn’t start 

once. In fact, she spent most of her 
time on the bench – playing only nine 
minutes per game and averaging a 
pedestrian 1.7 points and 2.6 rebounds.

“The early part of her career was 

tough. It was a journey,” said Joe 
Dunston, Jillian’s father. “Learning 
to be a major player on the floor and 
contributing is hard work. She had 
to get to where Coach (Barnes Arico) 
wanted her.”

Going from a high school star that 

received college offers from over 60 
schools to just another player may be 
difficult for anyone. But that is the 
harsh reality many college athletes 
face, and Jillian was no different.

“(Freshman year) was frustrating,” 

Dunston said. “Especially coming out 
of high school where I rarely came out 
the game.”

But Dunston had an advantage 

others didn’t: her father.

Growing up, Dunston learned from 

Joe, who played college ball at Tufts 
University. Despite strong basketball 
ties, Joe took a more hands-off 
approach by surrounding her with the 
best coaching possible.

But Joe did coach Dunston in certain 

ways. As he explained, he implemented 
a strong sense of work ethic, a lively 
personality and an appreciation for the 
game. And while Joe takes credit for 
Dunston’s personality, he gives kudos 
to his daughter for putting in the hard 
work necessary to elevate her game.

A lot has changed over the years. Joe 

admits that Dunston is a better player 
than him, but he could “possibly” beat 
her in a game of HORSE.

Backyard 
competitions 
aside, 

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Then-junior forward Jillian Dunston celebrated Michigan’s victory in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament championship game last year by cutting down the nets. Dunston collected 13 rebounds in the contest.

Michigan’s senior forward has grown to embrace her role as the Wolverines’ steady emotional leader

Dunston’s Michigan teammates have 
noticed the work ethic Joe instilled.

“The work ethic and the theme of 

‘hardest-working team in America’ 
is set by our other senior Jillian 
Dunston,” 
Barnes 

Arico said at Media 
Day. 
“If 
you’ve 

watched 
us 
play, 

(Dunston) … will do 
everything 
that’s 

needed to be done 
to help our team be 
successful. Whether 
that’s 
taking 
a 

charge to win a 
game, whether that’s 
a dive on the floor 
for a loose ball, get a key rebound or 
whatever we need to do.”

This was on full display throughout 

the WNIT run, where the senior 
amassed 54 rebounds – including 13 in 
the championship game. The forward 
also took a crucial charge at the end 
of regulation, forcing Georgia Tech’s 
leading scorer Zaire O’Neil out of the 
game. Then she hit two clutch free 
throws in the second overtime to pull 
Michigan ahead of the Yellow Jackets.

Those efforts found their way onto 

the stat sheet. What Dunston did 
before the start of the third overtime 
didn’t — but was perhaps even more 
important.

She told her teammates that they 

would win by 10. This must have given 
the Wolverines the confidence they 
needed. They outscored Georgia Tech 
13-3 in the final overtime, winning 
89-79.

***

None of this should be a surprise. 

Dunston’s 
grind-it-out 
mentality, 

hard-nosed 
style 
of 
play 
and 

persistence on the glass has been a 

constant throughout her career. With 
565 rebounds, Dunston ranks 16th in 
program history. If she can replicate 
her 286 boards from last season, she 
will finish tied for second most all-

time.

That ability helped 

her as a sophomore, 
as 
Dunston’s 
role 

increased, 
playing 

19 minutes per game 
and making nine spot 
starts. But the real 
strides came between 
her 
sophomore 
and 

junior seasons. All the 
dedication paid off. All 
the hours of training. 

All the time in the gym.

“I think patience and confidence 

was the biggest thing that propelled 
me my junior year,” Dunston explains. 
“I learned the impact I can make. I 
don’t have to be the leading scorer to 
have an impact on this team. I think 
that’s why I was able to have such a 
successful season.”

Last 
season, 
Dunston 
finally 

became an impact player, starting 
every game at forward spot while 
averaging 5.8 points per game and a 
team high 7.7 rebounds.

A lot of what Dunston brings to the 

court often gets overlooked. Grabbing 
rebounds and playing solid defense 
isn’t as glamorous as scoring 20-plus 
points a night. Players like Katelynn 
Flaherty and Hallie Thome consume 
much of the spotlight, earning the 
preseason and postseason accolades. 
This doesn’t bother Dunston, but she 
does envy her teammates’ ability to 
light up the scoreboard.

“I don’t mind not being the 

highlighted player because I know 
what I do for this team,” Dunston said. 

“But some days I do want to be that 
leading scorer. I sometimes do wish 
I could put the ball in the hoop like 
Hallie and Kate can. But you take your 
role, you embrace it, and you do the 
best you can.”

Dunston already does the little 

things well. This offseason, she 
worked on becoming more like 
Flaherty and Thome — and the scorers 
have taken notice.

“I think she’s going to be a big 

scoring threat,” Thome said. “Her 
ability to attack the basket and to be 
able to knock down a jump shot has 
really improved.”

Dunston doesn’t need to score 

20 points per game — her other 
contributions do enough. But her 
offseason efforts to add another 
aspect to her skillset only shows how 
determined she is to help her team 
improve upon last year’s finish.

***

Dunston 
has 
clearly 
found 

her role on the team as a hard-
working rebounder that does all the 
little things. Yet all that Dunston 
contributes doesn’t go unrecognized 
by her teammates.

“She’s 
grown 
so 
much 
since 

our freshman year,” said Flaherty, 
Dunston’s 
roommate. 
“She’s 
an 

incredible athlete. She has great speed 
and quickness and she rebounds well 
for us.”

Dunston’s most valuable assets are 

intangible and cannot be seen in the 
box score; she prides herself on her 
leadership skills.

“Everybody looks up to her,” said 

freshman guard Desha Church. “And 
we all respect her.”

Not only is she a leader, but anyone 

that watches Dunston play can see the 
energy and passion she approaches 

the game with. Whether it’s going up 
for a rebound, ripping the ball out of 
the hands of the opponent or laying 
out for a loose ball, she feels that she 
“can bring a spark when needed” – 
and her teammates agree.

“She is a positive energy all the 

time,” Flaherty explained. “She’s 
probably one of the funniest people 
I know. She always 
looks on the bright 
side of things and it 
is very inspirational 
to be around her.”

Her 
buoyant 

personality is clear 
from just watching 
how she interacts 
with 
teammates 

prior to games – 
dancing, 
laughing 

and 
performing 

elaborate handshakes. This vigor was 
immediately evident to freshmen such 
as Church.

“Her energy at practice is – well, 

if she wasn’t at practice, you would 
notice,” Church said. “She makes a 
presence. I’ve never seen her down 
before and she just makes you feel 
good if you’re down. And even outside 
of basketball, she is always positive.”

This sort of high-energy player 

and personality is what Barnes Arico 
saw out of Dunston as a high school 
recruit.

“I think every program needs a 

Jillian Dunston,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s just a really special kid and 

we’ve been fortunate to have her in 
our program.”

This season, the Wolverines will 

look to Dunston to continue their 
success and avoid another late-season 
skid.

Looking back, Dunston admits 

that the Wolverines may have let 
their ranking in the top 25 get to 

their 
heads. 
She 

acknowledges that the 
losing streak hurt them 
in the end, and likely 
cost them a trip to the 
NCAA Tournament – 
and all they can do now 
is learn from it.

She also explained 

that finding out that 
the Wolverines weren’t 
selected to the NCAA 
Tournament 
was 

devastating – and this motivates her.

As a senior, Dunston feels a 

responsibility to establish the team’s 
culture and not allow the group to 
become complacent. This may prove 
the difference in earning an NCAA bid 
or not. If the Wolverines learn from 
last season and make adjustments, 
Dunston 
believes 
Michigan 
will 

continue to make a national name for 
itself.

And with Media Day marking the 

beginning of a new season, Dunston 
can’t help but smile.

The season hasn’t started yet, but 

Dunston’s sure of one thing – “This 
year is going to be even better.”

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Dunston grabbed 12 rebounds in Michigan’s 65-43 win over Grand Valley State.

The early part 
of her career 
was tough. It 
was a journey.

I think every 

program 

needs a Jillian 

Dunston. 

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Dunston, now a senior, will be an integral leader for the Wolverines as they attempt to go dancing for the first time since 2012-13.

Roster breakdown: Flaherty, Thome 
once again crucial to Michigan’s success

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is relying on 
its upperclassmen heading into 
the 2017-18 season.

Though they lost two senior 

guards, 
Siera 
Thompson 

and 
Danielle 
Williams, 
the 

Wolverines 
have 
a 
lot 
of 

returners that make up the core 
of the team. That being said, 
there is a lot of young talent 
eager to get started.

Michigan 
finished 
last 

year with a 21-14 record and a 
WNIT Championship, but have 
their sights set on the NCAA 
Tournament this season after 
the heartbreak of missing out 
in 2016-17.

Guards
After 
losing 
two 
of 
its 

three 
starting 
guards 
from 

last 
season, 
it 
appears 
as 

though Michigan will almost 
completely have to re-work 
its starting lineup. The only 
returning 
player 
from 
the 

backcourt is senior Katelynn 
Flaherty, who has twice been 
named to the All-Big Ten First 
Team.

Flaherty 
has 
led 
the 

Wolverines since her freshman 
year. She averaged a team best 
20.2 points per game. Flaherty 
was the 2017 WNIT MVP and 
holds the school record for 
points in a game with 38. All 
eyes will be on her as she starts 
the season in a new position as 
point guard.

Joining 
Flaherty 
in 
the 

starting 
lineup 
is 
Nicole 

Munger. As a junior, the team 
is hoping her experience at the 
collegiate level will serve her 
well. She appeared in 35 games 
last 
season, 
averaging 
15.4 

minutes per game. Munger’s 
highlight of the season was a 
12-point performance in the 
WNIT 
championship 
game, 

including seven in the third 
overtime period.

Akienreh 
Johnson 
is 
the 

only other returning guard 
for the Wolverines. She begins 
her sophomore season after 
appearing in just 10 games last 
season due to a knee injury 
sustained in early January.

Michigan boasts two new 

additions to the backcourt in 

freshmen Priscilla Smeenge and 
Deja Church. Smeenge recently 
moved with her entire family to 
Michigan from Florida, where 
she had a noteworthy high 
school career. As a senior, she 
averaged 21.6 points per game 
and was named School District 
of Osceola Female Athlete of 
the Year.

Church, 
a 
native 
of 

Southfield, Mich., is expected 
to lead the offense at point 
guard 
alongside 
Flaherty. 

Although she is just starting her 
freshman year, Church looks 
college-ready 
as 
a 
physical 

point guard. She helped her 
high school win three district 
championships and one regional 
championship. 
She 
averaged 

24 points per game and was a 

finalist for Michigan’s Miss 
Basketball award.

Forwards
Senior 
Jillian 
Dunston 

stepped into her role as a 
leader for the team last year. 
She played a crucial part for 
the Wolverines, averaging 7.7 
rebounds per game. She started 
all 37 games, a large increase 
from 
her 
nine 
starts 
her 

sophomore year. In addition to 
tallying double-digit rebounds 
in 12 games, Dunston had 286 
rebounds on the year, which 
placed 
her 
fourth 
on 
the 

program’s single-season list.

Other 
returning 
forwards 

include Kayla Robbins, Keasja 
Peace and Samantha Trammel. 
During 
her 
freshman 
year, 

Robbins appeared in 34 games 
and averaged 8.8 minutes per 
game.

Newcomer 
Hailey 
Brown 

hails from Ontario, Canada, 
and the Wolverines will be 
hoping to put her international 
experience to good use. The 
freshman has played for the 
Canadian national team since 
2013 and has earned a gold 
medal for U-17 and a silver 
medal for U-16. Despite her 
youth, Brown has plenty of 
experience at the international 
level, which Michigan hopes 
can translate to the collegiate 
level with a minimal learning 
curve.

Center
Junior 
Hallie 
Thome 
is 

the sole returning center for 
Michigan. The 6-foot-5 junior 
will be returning to start her 
third season after making All-
Big Ten as well as earning a spot 
on the WNIT All-Tournament 
team. 
She 
averaged 
16.2 

points per game, 7.1 rebounds 
and two blocks on the year. 
Additionally, Thome started in 
all 37 games and scored in the 
double figures 35 times. Last 
season she became the third 
sophomore in Michigan history 
to reach 1,000 points.

Big Ten Breakdown: Familiar foes present challenge

Heartbroken.
That’s 
how 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team felt last 
March on selection day. Despite 
finishing 
third 
in 
a 
strong 

conference, 
the 
Wolverines 

failed to qualify for the NCAA 
Tournament 
for 
the 
fourth 

consecutive year.

Michigan made the most out 

of the situation, though, winning 
the Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament (WNIT) to claim 
their 
first-ever 
championship 

banner.

But 
a 
consolation 
bracket 

championship 
isn’t 
the 
end 

goal for a team that finished 
with a 28-9 overall record. The 
24th-ranked 
Wolverines 
are 

pushing to prove themselves 
worthy of a tournament bid this 
season.

The dynamic duo of senior 

guard Katelynn Flaherty and 
junior center Hallie Thome, as 
well as senior forward Jillian 
Dunston, all return. Flaherty 
and Thome were both selected 
as part of the preseason All-Big 
Ten Team. Freshman guard Deja 
Church and freshman forward 

Hailey Brown could also be 
difference makers.

While the Wolverines have 

talent and depth on the roster, 
there 
are 
plenty 
of 
teams 

standing in their way. The Daily 
breaks down this year’s Big Ten 
conference:

No. 5 Ohio State
Coming off a 28-7 season — 

which included a Sweet Sixteen 
appearance and a share of the 
Big Ten title — the Buckeyes 
look to be Michigan’s toughest 
competition.

Ohio 
State 
returns 
four 

starters, including senior guard 
Kelsey 
Mitchell 
and 
fifth-

year senior forward Stephanie 
Mavunga. The latter was a star at 
North Carolina for the first two 
years of her career before joining 
the Buckeyes. Despite missing 
time due to injuries, she averaged 
a double-double and was active 
on defense as a shot blocker.

Mitchell was nominated as 

the preseason Big Ten Player 
of the Year by both the coaches 
and media. It’s not a shock 
why. A skilled shooter and the 
conference’s 
highest-scoring 

player 
last 
season, 
Mitchell 

starred for Ohio State and has 
been a starter ever since joining 

the program.

Also returning are fifth-year 

senior 
guard 
Linnae 
Harper 

and redshirt junior guard Sierra 
Calhoun. Like Mavunga, neither 
started their careers in Columbus, 
transferring from Kentucky and 
Duke, 
respectively. 
Calhoun 

started 
in 
every 
game 
last 

year, and Harper accompanied 
Mitchell in playing on the USA 
Women’s U-23 National Team.

The Buckeyes defeated the 

Wolverines last year in their sole 
meeting, and they are talented 
enough to do the same this time 
around.

No. 15 Maryland
The Terrapins reached the 

Sweet Sixteen, ending the season 
with a 32-3 record. They won the 
Big Ten Tournament for the third 
consecutive year.

Maryland, though, returns just 

two starters in sophomore guard 
Kaila Charles and senior guard 
Kristen Confroy. Charles had an 
outstanding freshman season, 
making the All-Big Ten Freshman 
Team. Confroy is a reliable three-
point shooter and is one of just 
two seniors on the team.

But Maryland will need others 

to shine if it wants to compete 
in March. The team has a strong 

sophomore class — the No. 1 
recruiting class that year — 
that could provide the answer. 
Sophomore guards Sarah Myers 
and Blair Watson, as well as 
sophomore forward Stephanie 
Jones, are all back. The latter two 
battled injuries last season, and it 
is crucial for them to stay healthy 
for the Terrapins to make a run 
this year.

Aside 
from 
Charles, 

Maryland’s former top-ranked 
recruiting class doesn’t appear 
to have panned out yet. But if her 
classmates can stay healthy, there 
may not be as big of a drop-off as 
many expect.

Michigan State
The 
Spartans, 
meanwhile, 

return four starters. Last season, 
they made an NCAA Tournament 
appearance 
and 
finished 

21-12. Fifth-year senior guard 
Branndais Agee, senior forward 
Taya Reimer and sophomore 
guard Taryn McCutcheon were 
all standout players and will 
contribute again this year.

Michigan State has already 

faced 
hardship, 
though. 

Freshman 
guard 
Claire 

Hendrickson tore her ACL during 
the team’s first practice and is 
expected to miss the season. 

The Spartans have plenty of 
experienced players they can rely 
on, but Hendrickson’s injury is a 
blow to their depth.

Michigan 
State 
beat 
the 

Wolverines in both meetings last 
year, and it could be a thorn in 
Michigan’s side this year, too.

Iowa
The Hawkeyes missed out 

on 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 

last spring, but they still have 
a lot build on. They return 
four starters from last year’s 
team, which made the WNIT 
quarterfinals and finished with a 
20-14 record.

Junior 
forward 
Megan 

Gustafson started every game 
her sophomore year and will 
likely play a bigger role. She’s 
a skilled rebounder who can 
help the team establish itself 
in the paint. Sophomore guard 
Kathleen Doyle, who was invited 
to the USA U-19 tryouts during 
the summer, will also help carry 
the team.

Iowa was a high-scoring team 

last year — averaging 76.1 points 
per game — and will likely be 
this year as well. The Hawkeyes’ 
powerful 
offense 
will 
be 

challenging for defenses across 
the conference.

Minnesota
The Golden Gophers found 

trouble last season, finishing 10th 
in the Big Ten with a 15-16 overall 
record. They might have better 
luck this year, though, as they 
return seven upperclassmen.

Senior guard CarIie Wagner 

and redshirt junior guard Kenisha 
Bell were among the team’s top 
scorers last season and both will 
return. Sophomore guard Gadiva 
Hubbard will as well. She missed 
eight games due to injuries and 
illness, but made a clear impact 
when 
she 
played. 
Hubbard 

scored 28 points in Minnesota’s 
final game against then-No. 4 
Maryland. If she stays healthy 
this season, the Golden Gophers 
could take a step forward.

Indiana
The Hoosiers have trended 

upward the past few years. Their 
overall record has consistently 
improved, and last year they had 
a program record number of wins, 
finishing 23-11 and advancing to 
the WNIT quarterfinals.

This 
year 
will 
feature 
a 

different, younger squad with 
five new freshmen on the roster.

Indiana has just four players 
returning from last year. Senior 
guard Tyra Buss and senior 
forward Amanda Cahill were top 
scorers last season and could be 
impact players again. To find the 
same success, the Hoosiers need 
Buss and Cahill to help the others 
find their roles.

Purdue
After a solid 2016-2017 season 

— in which they played in the 
Big Ten championship game, 
advanced to the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament and 
finished with a 23-13 record — 
the Boilermakers are back and 
younger than ever.

Senior guard Andreona Keys 

is the sole senior on a team 
consisting of 10 underclassmen, 
so her leadership skills will be 
tested. It is unlikely that Purdue 
will be as good as last year, but if 
the youngsters learn their roles 
quickly, the team could be strong 
for years to come after brief 

growing pains.

Rutgers
The Scarlet Knights are the Big 

Ten’s mystery team. They return 
two starters, but also have a 
handful of new faces this season, 
including six transfers. It’s hard 
to predict how the team will do 
compared to last year, as it is 
very dependent on how well the 
transfers fit the system.

Returning is fifth-year senior 

guard Tyler Scaife, who missed 
last 
season 
due 
to 
injuries. 

Through her first three years, 
she was one of the best players 
on the team, averaging 17.2 points 
per game her junior season. A 
completely different style could 
be helpful to Rutgers, though, as 
it struggled mightily last year, 
finishing with a 6-24 record.

Wisconsin
Coming 
off 
a 
substandard 

9-22 season, the Badgers are 
looking to perform better this 
time around. Youth caused some 
issues, but this year, they return 
four starters and have a chance to 
improve in conference play.

Senior guard Cayla McMorris 

is the player to watch. She started 
in every game last season and is 
talented in all areas of the game. 
With many players returning, 
Wisconsin should make progress 
this season — though how much 
is uncertain.

Penn State
The 
Nittany 
Lions 
found 

success last season, finishing 
with a 21-11 record and advancing 
to the third round of the WNIT. A 
couple of their main contributors 
are gone, but junior guard Teniya 
Page and redshirt sophomore 
guard Amari Carter are two 
high-caliber players who return. 
Page led the team in points while 
Carter started at point guard the 
entire season.

Penn 
State 
has 
a 
senior-

less roster, so it is building the 
foundation for future years.

Illinois
The Fighting Illini are the 

same team as last year in most 
aspects — other than coaching. 
After finishing with a lackluster 
9-22 record, coach Matt Bollant 
was fired.

While he is gone, all five 

starters 
return, 
including 

sophomore guard Brandi Beasley. 
She had quite the impressive 
freshman year and is tracking 
to be one of the best players in 
program history.

Hall of Fame coach Nancy 

Fahey will be at the helm this 
year after a long tenure with 
Washington University in St. 
Louis. This marks her return 
to the Big Ten, as she played for 
Wisconsin in college. Experience 
— on both the roster and the 
sideline 
— 
should 
help 
the 

Fighting Illini step forward.

Northwestern
The Wildcats failed to qualify 

for the NCAA Tournament last 
spring, finishing with a 20-11 
record. But this year is much 
different.

The team lost a talented senior 

class, and will now have to rely 
on youth. Northwestern has four 
freshmen joining the team — and 
they have big shoes to fill. If they 
can adjust to the speed of the 
game by the time conference play 
begins, the freshmen could help 
the Wildcats meet the standard 

set by last year’s senior class.

Nebraska
The Cornhuskers are expected 

to be better this year. But that 
isn’t saying much, especially 
considering that they finished 
with a 7-22 record last season.

Three of their starters are 

returning, but they will have to 
perform much better to bounce 
back. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 

forward Rachel Blackburn is one 
player to look out for. She was a 
starter on a much more talented 
Nebraska squad at the start of 
her freshman year, but midway 
through the season, she faced 
multiple injuries and had to sit 
out her second year. If Blackburn 
can get and stay healthy, she 
could help the Cornhuskers find 
their groove.

Outlook
Overall, the Big Ten will once 

again be a strong conference. 
The Wolverines need to establish 
themselves in this competitive 
field 
to 
turn 
their 
NCAA 

Tournament dreams into reality.

But that is easier said than 

done.
