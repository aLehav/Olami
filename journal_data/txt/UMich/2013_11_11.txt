It's not often that hundreds of
students party with the Univer-

sity president.
Braving chilly temperatures,
students, staff, faculty and alum-
ni turned out Friday to celebrate
the formal launch of the Victors
for Michigan fundraising cam-
paign. Following an outdoor
community festival, attendees
crowded Hill Auditorium for a
glitzy campaign kickoff featur-
ing University President Mary
Sue Coleman and campaign
chair Stephen Ross.

Organized by the Universi-

festival and launch celebration
aimed to gather student and
donor support for the Victors for
Michigan fundraising campaign
- an ambitious $4 billion drive
slated to run until 2018.
With the inside of Hill Audi-
toriumbathed in blue light, cam-
paign organizers set the mood
on high as pop music blared
and crowds of yellow-shirted

students, alumni and guests
filled Hill's lower bowl and then
flowed up to the balcony.
In a carefully choreographed
lineup, discussion of the cam-
paign's top priorities - student
support, engaged learning and
bold ideas - were punctuated
by professionally produced vid-

U' sees up tick in
study abroad

With increased focus
and funding, more
students study outside
of the United States
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily Staff Reporter
Early Monday, the University
announced that it now ranks tenth in
* a national list of universities with the
most students studying abroad. The fig-
ure is significant in a way, as the Univer-
sity didn't even make the list between
2002 and 2005.
The 2012 to 2013 Institute of Inter-
national Education Open Doors survey
* showed that the University enrolled
2,060 students in study-abroad pro-
grams in 2011-2012, a 6 percent increase
over the previous period.
One of University President Mary Sue
Coleman's presidential initiatives during
her time at the helm has been an expan-
sion of study-abroad programs - some-
thing that wasn't a priority when she
began her tenure in 2002.
Between 2002 and 2005, fewer than
1,300 students enrolled in study-abroad
programs. The University earned a spot
on the list starting in 2006, and enroll-

ment has since fluctuated around 2,000
students.
However, when it comes to assessing
the quality of study-abroad programs,
the raw number of enrolled students
doesn't tell the whole story. According
to JamesPaul Holloway, vice provost for
global and engaged education, the sur-
vey only reflects students doing study
abroad for credit.
"The data you don't see there is the
co-curricular that that survey has not
systematically collected." said Holloway.
"The message for us, I think, is that for
students it's not about credit. It's about
educational experiences abroad, wheth-
er they're for credit or not."
The results from the 2010 to 2011
school year placed the University's
enrollment of 1,964 squarely in the
middle of the pack of peer institutions,
between a high of 2,451 at the University
of California, Los Angeles and a low of
1,347 at the University of Iowa. The full
2012-2013 ranking list was not available
Sunday.
Those co-curricular, or non credit-
granting opportunities, attracted 400
University students in 2005. By 2010,
co-curricular enrollment had grown to
1,500 students. The most popular desti-
nation for credit-granting programs was
Spain, with 312 students, followed by

About 500 people watched Sunday
as veterans of the United States Navy
and Army battled during a game of
wheelchair basketball to celebrate both
the service of military veterans as well
as the accomplishments of those with
physical disabilities.
The Army vs. Navy Wheelchair Bas-
ketball Game served as the last event
in the Investing in Ability Week spon-

the Veterans Week celebrations at the
University that will continue until Fri-
day.
The Navy may have overpowered
with a 31-22 win over the Army, but
there was more to the afternoon than
just the scoreboard.
Gerald Hoff, the event's organizer
and an insurance representative at the
University of Michigan Health System,
said the event was held to celebrate all
veterans regardless of physical ability.
"There may be many celebrity-type
games, but when it comes to Army-
Navy, you can say it's on," Hoff said.
"When that ball drops, these guys and
ladies go at it and they are very serious

Students travel to D.C. for protest

University students united
with protesters from across the
country in Washington, D.C. in
opposition to United States mili-
tary intervention in the Carib-
bean and Central America.
Michigan students made up
120 of the 50,000 demonstra-
tors, gathering first near the State'
Department for speakers and
music before marching to the
White House.
"Most people here already
know the problems," said gradu-
ate student Patrick Jones. "Oth-
ers need to be convinced that the
blood of the people of Nicaragua
is on their hands."

Francois Bochud, director of
Switzerland's Institute of Radi-
ation Physics, which carried out
the investigation, said at a news
conference.
Bochud and Patrice Mangin,
director of the Lausanne Uni-
versity Hospital's forensics cen-
ter, said they tested and ruled
out innocent explanations, such
as accidental poisoning.
"I think we can eliminate this
possibility because, as you can
imagine, you cannot find poloni-
um everywhere. It's a very rare
toxic substance," Mangin told
The Associated Press.
Palestinian officials, includ-
ing Arafat's successor, Pales-
tinian President Mahmoud
Abbas, had no comment on the
substance of the report but
promised a continued investi-
gation.
The findings are certain to
revive Palestinian allegations
against Israel, a nuclear power.
Polonium can be a byproduct of
the chemical processing of ura-
nium, but usually is made arti-
ficially in a nuclear reactor or a
particle accelerator.
Arafat's widow, Suha, called
on the Palestinian leadership
to seek justice for her hus-
band, saying, "It's clear this is a
crime."
Speaking by phone from the
Qatari capital Doha, she did
not mention Israel but argued
that only countries with nuclear
capabilities have access to polo-
nium.
In another interview later
Thursday, she described her
husband's death as a "political
assassination" and "the crime of
the century" and called the new
testing conclusive for poisoning.
She said she couldn't predict
who was behind the death, but
she added, "Whoever did this
crime is a coward."
Israel has repeatedly denied
a role in Arafat's death and
did so again Thursday. Paul
Hirschson, a Foreign Ministry
official, dismissed the claim as
"hogwash."

Typhoonz survvors struggle
for aid in the Philippines

Death toll estimated
at 10,000 in worst
storm in country's
history
TACLOBAN, Philippines
(AP) - Rescuers faced blocked
roads and damaged airports on
Monday as they raced to deliver
desperately needed tents, food
and medicines to the typhoon-
devastated eastern Philippines
where thousands are believed
dead.
Three days after the Typhoon
Haiyan ravaged the region, the
full scale of the disaster - the
biggest faced by the Philip-
pines - was only now becoming
apparent.
The winds and the sea waves
whipped up were so strong
that they washed hulking
ships inland, which now stood
incongruously amid debris of
buildings, trees, road signs and
people's belongings.
Authorities estimated that up
to 10,000 people may have died.
But the government, stunned by

w


the scale of the disaster, has not
given an official death toll yet.
Still, officials said after survey-
ing the areas there is little doubt
that the death toll will be that
high, or even higher.
In Tacloban city, the capital
of Leyte province, corpses hung
from trees and were scattered
on sidewalks. Many were bur-
ied in flattened buildings. The
entire city appeared to have
been obliterated. From the air
the landscape resembled a giant
garbage dump punctuated by a
few concrete buildings that still
stood.
Survivors wandered through
the remains of their flattened
wooden homes looking to sal-
vage belongings or to search for
loved ones.
Very little assistance had
reached the city, residents
reported. Some took food, water
and consumer goods from aban-
doned shops, malls and homes.
"This area has been totally
ravaged", said Sebastien Sujob-
ert, head of the International
Committee of the Red Cross in
Tacloban. "Many lives were lost,
a huge number of people are


missing, and basic services such
as drinking water and electricity
have been cut off," he said.
He said both the Philippine
Red Cross and the ICRC offices
in Tacloban had been damaged,
forcing staff to relocate tempo-
rarily.
Haiyan hit the eastern sea-
board of the Philippines on Fri-
day and quickly barreled across
its central islands, packing winds
of 235 kph (147 mph) that gusted
to 275 kph (170 mph), and a storm
surge of 6 meters (20 feet).
Even though authorities had
evacuated some 800,000 people
ahead of the typhoon, the death
toll was so high because many
evacuation centers - brick-and-
mortar schools, churches and
government buildings - could
not withstand the winds and
water surges. Officials said peo-
ple who had huddled in these
buildings drowned or were
swept away.
It inflicted serious damage to
at least six islands in the middle
of the eastern seaboard, with
Leyte, Samar and the northern
part of Cebu appearing to bear
the brunt of the storm. About 4

and research faculty who rely

efforts will be difficult to sus-

Engineering Prof. Anna Ste-
fanopoulou, the director of the
Automotive Research Center,
said the sequester has not only
reduced the center's funding,
but also created a lot of uncer-
tainty. She said the center,
which is funded solely by the
Department of Defense and
focuses on modeling and simu-
lating ground vehicle technol-
ogy, may experience a talent
drain with reduced funding.
"If we don't know exactly
what our funding is, we cannot
compete and recruit our best stu-
dents," she said.
In anticipation of contin-
ued decline in federal funding
brought on by the second round
of sequestration, Forrest said his
office has been concentrating
on diversifying their research
portfolio. Fiscal year 2013 saw
a 14-percent growth in industry
funding, chiefly coming from
the health care, automotive and
electronics industries. Howev-
er, Forrest added that industry
still comprises only 8 percent of
research funding, and could not
be relied upon to fill the gap left
by the federal government.
"There is no real substitute -
and there never has been - in
this country for federal support
in research," Forrest said, noting
that even industry funding relies
on federal support. "Every sig-
nificant advance in technology
in the postwar era has had its ori-
gin in federal funding, from inte-
grated circuits to the Internet."
If anything, many in the
research community say their
options for scientific exploration
are more constrained - a chal-

itself on being one of the top
research institutions inthe nation.
"Don't get me wrong, it's not

haus said. "You just don't know

Hamas government hires first
ever female spokesperson

Almodallal is part
of push to present
friendlier face to the
West, women
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- The Hamas government of the
Gaza Strip has for the first time
appointed a woman to represent
it to the world.
The hiring of Isra Almodallal
as a spokeswoman for the terri-
tory's conservative Islamist rul-
ers is part of a long-running push
by the group, which has at times
sought to curb women's free-
doms, to present a newer friend-
lier face both to its own citizens
and internationally.
Almodallal, a 23-year-old who
speaks fluent British-accented
English, has assumed a post nor-
mally held by tough-talking men
who voice Hamas' bitter opposi-
tion to Israel. She will be respon-
sible for the Gaza government's
communications with the inter-
national media.
"We are looking forward to
having a different and unique
language," said Almodallal in
an interview in her Gaza City
office, on her firstweek in the job.
"We will make the issues more
human."
The change in policy began six
months ago when a new head of
the government media depart-
ment, Ihab Ghussein, took over.
He hired younger media people,
started a new official govern-
ment website, began rampant
use of social media and started
conducting seminars and work-
shops.
Ghussein said he appointed

Almodallal in an effort "to be
more open to the West." He said
many women were among the
dozens of applicants considered
for the position.
"Women are partners in our
society," Ghussein said.
Almodallal, a divorced mother
of a four-year-old girl, does not
have her roots in the Hamas
movement. Unlike many other
Hamas officials, her office does
not bear a photo of Gaza's Prime
Minister Ismail Haniyeh. She
keeps a book on American his-
tory there, alongside the Quran.
She was raised in Gaza and
spent five years in Britain as a
teenager, studying at Grange
Technology College, a high
school in Bradford in the U.K.
Upon returning to Gaza, she
studied journalism at the Islamic
University, and worked as a TV
reporter for a local station and an
English-language satellite chan-
nel, which she said taught her
how to present herself on cam-
era.
Her appointment is the lat-
est step by Hamas to manage its
image.
"Hamas, as any other govern-
ment in the world, want others
to listen and believe in them,"
said Moean Hassan, a lecturer
in media at Gaza's Palestine Uni-
versity.
Since the group overran the
territory in 2007, it has cautious-
ly attempted to enforce its deeply
conservative version of Islam
and has at times placed some
restrictions on women's behav-
ior. But it has refrained from
passingsweepinglIslamic legisla-
tion, apparently fearing a public
backlash, despite criticisms form
ultraconservatives who say it is

not implementing Islamic law
quickly enough.
Under Hamas, there has been
mounting social pressure on
women to cover up in the tradi-
tional Islamic dress of long robes
and headscarves. The Hamas
government has also banned
them from riding on the backs
of motorbikes and from smoking
water pipes, but these rules have
not always been enforced. Earlier
this year, the Hamas government
barred girls and women from
participatingin aU.N.-sponsored
marathon, prompting a U.N. aid
agency to cancel the race.
At the same time, women
are permitted to work, drive
and hold public office, with one
female minister and six female
deputy ministers serving in the
Hamas government. Some 20 per
cent of public servants working
for Hamas are women.
Almodallal asserts that
women in Gaza are finding their
way into politics, medicine, edu-
cation and media. "Every day,
women's footsteps can be seen
advancing more in society," she
said.
Almodallal takes a slightly
different line than many Hamas
spokesmen. She refers to "Israel"
rather than the "Zionist entity."
And she does not consider her-
self a Hamas loyalist, saying she
would be equally willing to work
as spokeswoman for the rival
Palestinian government in the
West Bank.
But she does believe - in line
with the Hamas position - that
the Palestinians should con-
trol all of historic Palestine, or
the land between the Mediter-
ranean and the Jordan River,
including what is now Israel.

Kerry, Rouhami
seek solutions to
nuclear programs,
sanctions
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - With
a first round of nuclear negotia-
tions with world powers end-
ing without agreement, Iranian
officials looked ahead Sunday
to parallel talks with the U.N.'s
nuclear chief amid reminders
that concessions by Tehran
have limits.
The overall message from
Iran closely mirrored the work-
in-progress tone of U.S. Secre-
tary of State John Kerry and
other powerful envoys, who
failed to seal a first-step accord
during overtime talks in Gene-
va but then quickly agreed to
try again next week.
The administration of Ira-
nian President Hassan Rou-
hani is emphasizing that the
talks are a work in progress.
He's mollifying hard-liners by
reasserting that Iran will keep
on with nuclear activities that
it insists are its right, but at the
same time is trying to quell any
hints of stalemate in the nego-
tiations. The impression that
the talks are sputtering could
embolden critics uneasy over
his government's historic out-
reach to the U.S and fast-track
effort to ease Western concerns
over Tehran's nuclear ambi-
tions.
The framework for a pos-
sible deal could see an easing
of U.S.-led economic sanctions
in exchange for curbs on Iran's
highest levels on uranium
enrichment. Among the com-
plications ahead, though, is
addressing French concerns
that the proposed limits on
Iran's ability to make nuclear
fuel don't go far enough and
alarm over a planned heavy

water reactor that produces
greater amounts of byproduct
plutonium, which can be used
in nuclear weapon production.
Iran insists it rejects nuclear
arms and only wants reactors
of energy and medical applica-
tions, such as isotopes for can-
cer treatment.
Rouhani said progress was
made during "serious" talks
in Geneva with the six-nation
group, the permanent U.N.
Security Council members plus
Germany.
But he repeated that Iran
cannot be pushed to fully give
up uranium enrichment - a
comment that echoes past dec-
larations and appears aimed at
opponents of his nuclear dia-
logue with the West.
In related talks, U.N. nuclear
chief Yukiya Amano headed
to Tehran on Sunday for meet-
ings on the practical aspects
of expanding international
monitoring and gaining greater
access to nuclear sites. Attempts
have been stymied by nearly
two years of arguments over
what can be seen and who can
be interviewed by experts from
the U.N.'s International Atomic
Energy Agency.
Iran's new leadership has
promised more cooperation,
and Amano said "we aim to
build" on the offers. A positive
report from Amano could help
drive forward negotiations set
to resume Nov. 20 between Iran
and the six world powers.
Foreign Minister Moham-
mad Javad Zarif, in a posting
on his Facebook page Sunday,
said there are "some problems"
still to overcome with the six
powers, but called the latest
round "serious but respectful."
Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy
foreign minister and one of the
top nuclear negotiators, call the
Geneva rounds "very intensive
and difficult, but useful and
constructive."

Following cities' lead
Anti-discrimination legislation should be adopted at all levels
n Nov. 5th, voters in Royal Oak, Mich. approved a human-rights
ordinance that prohibits discrimination based on sexual ori-
entation and other identities, joining 29 other communities in
the state that have adopted similar policies. Clearly Royal Oak's push to
become a more inclusive community isn't an anomaly, and similar legisla-
tion should be adopted at the local and state level.

In the weeks leading up to the Nov. 5 elec-
tion, opposition from groups like Just Royal
Oak mobilized in an attempt to thwart the
ordinance's passage. The group centered its
argument on the potential increase in law-
suits and sex crimes that may arise from
banning discrimination. They're concerned
that businesses may become subject to law-
suits under the new legislation, a concern
that apparently trumps anti-discrimination
in housing and employment. Adversaries of
the proposed city law have argued that tol-
erance for the LGBTQ community is already
high, eliminating the need to institutionalize
anti-discrimination. "I don't believe it should
be a civil right," said Fadwa Gillanders, the
head of the Just Royal Oak campaign. "(The
LGBTQ community) is already protected on
the basis of their sex, their gender."
But the logic used by Gillanders and other
opponents to the new statute falls flat. The
group argued against legislation that may
lead to more gender-neutral restrooms, say-
ing, "There are a lot of bathroom cases of men
coming in and taking pictures under the stalls
- of masturbating in front of little girls."
That anecdote appears to have come from a
case in Colorado, where one student allegedly
harassed other students ina female restroom.
The case, propelled by conservative religious
publications, has since been debunked by the
school's superintendent. Furthermore, the
arguments used by the ordinance's detrac-
tors are nothing more than fear-mongering..
According to Michigan Radio, claims of
rampant lawsuits following the ordinance's
passage are largely baseless, as the cities in
Michigan with similar statutes report few, if
any, lawsuits based on such anti-discrimina-

tion laws. "The non-discrimination policies
offer legal recourse where there are none,"
said Emily Dievendorf, the managing direc-
tor of Equality Michigan. "The state of Mich-
igan provides no protections for the LGBTQ
community from discrimination in employ-
ment, housing and public accommodations.
And our local governments are stepping up to
the plate to protect their citizens."
The ordinance provides not only legal pro-
tection to the city's LGBTQ community, but
also psychological protection. The fines and
legal pathways are critical in safeguarding
LGBTQ residents, but the city's adoption of
such member signal a widespread acceptance
of an often-targeted community. In 2001, a
similar ballot was struck down in Royal Oak
by a two to one margin. Twelve years later,
the attitudes in the city have shifted, with
more than 53 percent of voters supporting the
ordinance. Royal Oak Mayor Jim Ellison sup-
ported the ordinance, saying, "It is needed. It
is the right time for it. Look around the coun-
try and the state. Attitudes are changing."
While Royal Oak's new statute offers a
previously nonexistent legal pathway for the
LGBTQ community, its strength won't fully
be realized until both other cities and the state
pass similar legislation. Currently, Michigan's
civil rights legislation doesn't protect LGBTQ
residents. But even augmenting the state leg-
islation isn't enough. According to Allison
VanKuiken, campaign manager for One Royal
Oak, complaints filed through state law would
have to be run through the attorney general,
whereas local ordinances can be filed with
nearby authorities. Both cities and the state
must pass legislation that will protect the
LGBTQ community at all levels.

Gains of learning language
outweigh chance of misuse
and commodification
TO THE DAILY:
In Layan Charara's article "Language - the
tool of oppression" she condemns those in her
Arabic language class for wishing to join the
U.S. State Department. It's quite bafflingto me
why one would object to diplomats - people
whose job is to communicate with other
countries - learning the native language.
While I agree with Charara that awareness
of the misuse of language in politics is
essential,she seems to be unaware ofherironic
use of stock political phrases in place of actual
evidence or argument. The article is filled with
the type of meaningless cliches George Orwell

railed against in his 1946 "Politics and the
English language:" "clarion call," "inherently
imperialistic endeavor," "breeding people of
privilege," "commodification of language." I
feel like I've just won a game of progressive
jargon bingo.
The language requirement in the college
of LSA is there for a reason. If Charara really
does see the next Donald Rumsfeld sitting
across from her, isn't it a good thing that the
potential imperialist is learning about the
native language and culture from dedicated
teachers? What's the alternative - no one in
the diplomatic corps or law enforcement that
can communicate with an Arabic speaker? I
side with Orwell: "language is an instrument
for expressing and not for concealing or
preventingthought."
Robert Havey
2009 Alum

I've been a die-hard Residential
College student ever since I came to
the University two and a half years
ago. I've declared my RC major,
joined an RC a cappella group, par-
ticipated in RC plays, written for RC
publications and done mymandated
time in an RC language class. I lived
in East Quad Residence Hall my
freshman year, and though it took
some time, I grew into the RC life-
style. I walked around the building
without shoes, went to morning lec-
ture in my pajamas and knew lunch-
time conversations were to be had
in a language other than English.
I will be the first to admit that
East Quad itself had some quirks,
for lack of a better word. Many
could call them flaws, but they were
part of the charm of the RC experi-
ence. Personally, I enjoyed that the
showerheads were best fit for those
5'5" and under because, as a 5'4"
girl, they made washing shampoo
out of my hair much quicker. Hear-
ing a toilet flush overhead during a
class was commonplace and added a
comedic interlude to serious debates
or tense conversations. The carpets
had a different dizzying pattern in
every room, spotted with mysteri-
ous stains, and the walls were only
a modest cinderblock. The ceilings
were a maze of piping, blotted with
the occasional leak and containing
possible asbestos threats, but the
health department hadn't shut us
down yet, so all was well. The Half-
Ass smelled like cream of broccoli
soup, but that didn't matter when
there was a free concert.
To most people, this lifestyle could
be deemed unorthodox at best, but to
RCers, it was a safe, anything-goes
kind of place, in which being differ-
ent was allowed, if not encouraged.
This difference was precisely what
deterred others from visiting East
Quad, keeping the community safely
enclosed and sheltered from out-
side criticism. When East Quad was
closed for renovations, however, all
of this changed.
RC faculty worked extremely
hard to ease the pains of transition
from East to West Quad; however,
the community took a serious hit.
Sophomores like myself couldn't

identify RC freshmen from anyone
else in the dining hall, depleting
the relationship between first- and
second-year students, and thus the
sense of community the RC tries to
stand for. Classes were in Denni-
son instead of the basement, mean-
ing it was necessary to put on real
clothes, walk across campus and sit
in a windowless building that has
been called ten levels of hell. As
terrible as Dennison is, it was truly
only one of many nails in the RC's
coffin that year.
Then, finally, a whole homeless
year later, East Quad was back.
RCers like myself rejoiced, look-
ing forward to wandering familiar
halls, sitting in old classrooms and
having a place to be weird without
being scoffed at by others.
Instead, we were greeted by a
generic building that lacks char-
acter and can be best compared to
the rich section of a shopping mall
or a brand new airport. For a reno-
vation that claimed it would main-
tain the integrity of the building, it
became blaringly clear that those
involved felt that there was not
much worth keeping except for the
outer walls. What appeared to be
the same building, the same home
was in reality gutted and redone
without much thought to the uses
of the building or the character of
the people that would be using it.
I'm not saying that new East
Quad isn't nice. It's clean and mod-
ern and freshmen that live there
now appreciate their new home as
much as I had appreciated mine
two years ago. However, they aren't
privy to how much was lost when
the building was redone.
The Half-Ass, or Halfway Inn,
was altogether removed from the
building's layout. It was not only a
place to study for students living
in East Quad, but a performance
venue for bands, a theater practice
space, a meeting room for forums
and the home of many art events
like open mic nights and poetry
readings. Without it, the art com-
munity is left only with one stage:
the Keene Theater. But, where is
the Keene Theater? Somehow in the
renovation, the outdoor entrance to

the theater was forgotten, the two
levels ofseatingwere separated and
left unmarked, and, adding insult
to injury, the lighting system was
disconnected and is now deemed
unsafe and unusable for what could
be the rest of the year. The East
Quad Music Co-op, a student run
non-profit that hosted shows in the
Half-Ass, not only lost their venue
space but also their office space,
which has been diminished to a
cage in a utility room. There are
also fewer music practice rooms
and the theater's classroom doubles
as a dance studio, combining two
heavily used spaces into just one
room with a mean septic leak.
For a community centered on
arts, the renovation certainly has
failed to prioritize the needs of the
artists who are living in the space.
My disdain for the new build-
ing doesn't even end with all that
was forgotten when redesigning
the quad; some of the additions are
just as ridiculous. First of all, why
so much glass? Is it supposed to be a
fish bowl or a zoo? Do people enjoy
being stared at in their glass class-
rooms, study lounges, or offices?
Why is there a portion of the cafete-
ria named 24 Carrots? Why 24, and
why carrots? Additionally, why so
mainstream? Everything about the
building reeks of business-mod that
appeals to potential students but
ignores the down-to-earth nature
of the RC.
East Quadders don't need swank
or class. We need walls that can be
painted on with murals of unicorns
and rainbows. We don't need a big
fancy cafeteria with "seven restau-
rant concepts," whatever the hell
that means anyway. We need more
pianos and places to dance at three
in the morning and stages to throw
free concerts on. We need the free-
dom to walk around without shoes
on and make the space our own,
not to feel afraid to leave our hand-
prints on yet another glass surface.
Regardless of how necessary the
renovation was, $116 million dollars
is an astronomical sum of money to
spend on making a home into a hotel.

DRIVE
From Page 1A
tives - Coleman, Ross or Regent
Julia Darlow (D) - appeared
onstage to discuss with students
the impact of their University
experience and the importance
of their overall message.
Engineering junior Hannah
Cheriyan, one of the students
featured in Ross' segment on "big
ideas," shared her experience
working in a University medical
lab. The lab works with ECMO
machines, an artificial respira-
tory medical device that saved
Cheriyan's life as a newborn.
"It was so exhilarating to see
everyone in the audience getting
so pumped up and waving their
lights around (as) I was talk-
ing about a cause I really love,"
Cheriyan said.
In a program largely focused
on showcasing exceptional stu-
dents and the University pro-
grams about which they're
passionate, Cheriyan said effec-
tive storytelling played a crucial
role in connecting with alumni
and potential donors.
That type of storytelling will
play a central role in the fun-
draising campaign's strategy,
especially considering its focus
on student support.
In an interview after the event,
Coleman said the testimoni-
als captured Michigan in a form
"more beautiful" than she could
have imagined.
"Itwasveryemotionalbecause
I think that what this represents,
for me, it was so much about the
energy of the students and what
they can do and how committed
they are, not only to this place,
but to the world," Coleman said.
And after the showcase Friday,
it seems the student's energy -
and the campaign's strategy -
are already paying off.
Jerry May, University vice
president for development, said
in the last few days, scores of
donors have approached him
during kickoff-related events
ready to make contributions.
"The students just knocked
it out of the park tonight," May
said in an interview inside Hill
Auditorium. "I was so proud to
have students being themselves
because it makes me realize why
I do what I do every day, and I'll
guarantee you every develop-
ment officer in the room felt the
same way."
May and development offi-
cials are also relying on the cam-
paign's inclusive nature to drive
giving as well as foster an under-
standing of philanthropy's role at
the University. Though the Uni-
versity hosted multiple alumni
and donor events Friday night,
campaign organizers also prided
themselves on the very public
launch - an unusual platform for
University campaign kickoffs.
One of the Victors for Michi-
gan campaign's vice chairs, Rich
Rogel, who also chaired the

Michigan Difference campaign
from 2003 to 2008, said the event
gave him a message and materials
to take to other donors and sup-
porters throughout the country
and the world.
"It's motivating donors, but
it's also educating people about
what's going on at this univer-
sity - it is incredible what we're
doing here," Rogel said. "I'm over
in China, and they know what
we're doing here more than some
people in the state of Michigan,
sometimes."
Rogel, who donated $50 mil-
lion, added that he expects to be
back in Ann Arbor 10 to 12 times
per year until the campaign ends
to engage with donors, develop-
ment planners and University
officials.
Darlow, who spoke about the
campaign's primary goal of fun-
draising for student support, said
after the event that she was proud
to represent the University's gov-
erning board in articulating the
need for affordability.
Darlow added that Coleman's
gravitas with donors and stu-
dents alike helped make the event
a success.
"Mary Sue Coleman, the emo-
tion that she evokes in all of us, it
was really very special," Darlow
said. "The love that was in the
auditorium for her tonight was
extraordinary."
Just prior to the main event
in Hill Auditorium, hundreds of
students congregated on Ingalls
Mall beneath strings of holiday
lights and among the scents of
cider and popcorn for the kick-
off's community festival.
LSA freshmen Jennifer Wang
and Puja Nair hadn't heard about
the event prior to wandering
through for cider.
Though they had read the
e-mail from Coleman sent to stu-
dents earlier in the week to pub-
licize the kickoff, Wang and Nair
did not know much about the
campaign prior to the festival.
Engineering senior Michelle
McClaughry also saw Coleman's
e-mail and decided to support the
University's efforts.
"I knew that it was philan-
thropy and donating money and I
knew there was going to be food
but I didn't know it was going to
be like this," McClaughry said.
Still, a handful of students in
attendance hesitated to laud the
campaign's initial efforts.
Steps from a cider stand, two
students handed out flyers pro-
testing the University's Munger
Residence Hall construction, a
project funded by a $110 million
gift from philanthropist Charles
Munger.
Rackham student Arcelia Guti-
errez said she hopes the Univer-
sity will consider student input in
deciding what the project's dona-
tions will be directed toward, as
some students have expressed
discontent with the new hall's
design and cost.
"We want to have people
thinking more critically about

donations," Gutierrez said.
Additionally, the Coalition for
Tuition Equality, a student group
that presses for granting in-state
tuitiontoundocumented resident
students, placed posters strung
along trees and lamps in front of
Hill Auditorium before the kick-
off. Many of the posters included
the phrase "Victors for Diversity"
- a play on the official campaign
name.
LSA senior Jacob Huston, a
CTE member and speaker for
the Michigan Latin@ Assembly,
said the goal was not to protest
the campaign's launch, but rather
to draw attention to the unmet
financial need of many undocu-
mented students.
"We want them to guarantee
that they'll meet the full financial
need of these students," Huston
said. "In reality, there's probably
not too many of these students
coming to the University, but
still, the need that they have is
very real."
LSA senior Meg Scribner,
along with other CTE organiz-
ers, met with University devel-
opment officials in recent weeks
to discuss aid for minority and
undocumented students. CTE
hopes to encourage financial aid
for undocumented students as
part of the campaign's $1 billion
target for student support.
Because the donors choose the
initiatives to which they gave,
Scribner said CTE plans to work
with development officials to
recruit donors to their cause.
Further down Ingalls Mall,
1969 University alum Richard
Price, Jr. had wandered to the
festival after attending an alumni
function in the Michigan League.
Price has been previously
involved in University campaigns
and said he was invited to attend
the kickoff festivities. He also
lauded the University's top cam-
paign priority: student aid.
"It looks like what they (the
University) are trying to do ulti-
mately is subsidize lots of under-
graduates so they don't have to
pay $50,000 a year," Price said.
"So I think that's awesome."
At the event in the League, Price
said student recipients of financial
aid shared the impact of University
support on their collegiate experi-
ence. He said this strategy was
particularly effective.
But after the lights of Friday's
events go dark, University offi-
cials are tasked with carrying
out the remainder of a multi-year,
multi-billion-dollar campaign.
E. Royster Harper, University
vice president for student life,
said the campaign's $1billion tar-
get for student support makes her
ready to work even harder.
"It's when you have to hit
the pavement," Harper said.
"The real work now is talking to
donors, talking to alums and try-
ing to achieve our goal."

ABROAD
From Page 1A
Italy, Germany, the United King-
dom, China and France.
"We're different from a lot of
schools because what we offer
students is many, many oppor-
tunities of all kinds," Holloway
said.
Today, the University offers
students the chance to study in 78
different countries. In compari-
son, Indiana University sends
students to 52 countries, and
UCLA sends students to 35.
The program has also experi-
enced internal growth over the
past 11 years. For students in the
School of Art & Design, study
abroad is a requirement.
Holloway said the School of
Information just launched a new
programto provide students with
study-abroad opportunities, and
the dean of the College of Engi-
neering has begun pushing for all
students to have a study-abroad
component.
"There's really been an explo-
sion in education abroad at the
University of Michigan," Hollo-
way said. "Of course, we always
had programs, we had strong
programs before (Coleman)
came, but when she came and
put a leadership focus on this, it

really made folks stop and think
and take note."
Coleman has also personally
backed the push with her own
money. Along with her husband,
Kenneth Coleman, she has donat-
ed about $1 million to study-
abroad programs during her time
at the University. Both Colemans
studied abroad in their college
years.
During the past 11 years,
overall donations for study-
abroad opportunities have
grown dramatically, according
to Brodie Remington, senior
director of international giv-
ing in the University's Office of
Development.
Remington said Coleman's
success in securing a $5 million
challenge grant in 2009 ended
up bringing in $15 million for a
study-abroad endowment. Chal-
lenge grants are a matching dona-
tion scheme meant to motivate
donors to give more.
"Both President Coleman
and Ken Coleman's gift, and the
challenge, really increased the
visibility of fundraising." said
Remington.
Increasing University stu-
dents' global experiences will
also be a focus of the newly
launched Victors for Michigan
funding campaign.
For LSA senior Antonio Bar-

ron, one of the first recipients of
a scholarship from Coleman's
endowed fund, receiving support
meant much more than just get-
ting financial aid.
"It's allowing you to have this
life-changing experience abroad
that not many students get to
have because of financial costs."
Barron said. "There was a lot of
encouragement I received from
the scholarship and from having
the University support me."
Last spring, the U.S. News
and World Report published its
inaugural ranking of the top 50
study-abroad programs at col-
leges worldwide - based on aca-
demic rigor and student-culture
interaction. Administrators at
thousands of colleges submitted
nominations for the rankings.
Peer institutions including
Indiana University, UCLA, and
the University of Texas made
the U.S. News list. The Univer-
sity did not, which officials say
can partially be attributed to its
focus on co-curricular opportu-
nities rather than credit-granting
options.
Coleman has made engage-
ment with Africa and China a
priority for her administration.
During her tenure, she has also
made trips to Ghana and Brazil,
and is set to travel to India this
week.


GAME
From Page 1A
While certain wheelchair
basketball players were physi-
cally disabled as a result of their
services, others played to show
solidarity. In addition, members
of an official wheelchair basket-
ball team were divided between
the Navy and Army teams and
incorporated into the game so
that there would be at least three
veterans on the court at all times.
Although the student veter-
ans and wheelchair basketball
team members did not practice

together prior to game day, Hoff
said he believed that there was an
"instant chemistry" between the
two groups.
"The wheelchair team had
the ability to overcome, whether
it was a serious accident or it
could have been from birth and
that's why they're where they are
today," Hoff noted. "Our military
is the same way - it's about doing
whatever you can to get the job
done."
The event, which was free to
the public, included a National
Anthem performance by the Tri-
Service Color Guard and select
members of the Men's Glee Club.

The University of Michigan
Dance Team and 338th Army
Band held shows between the
quarters.
Despite the Army-Navy rivalry
that themed the event, Robert
McDivitt, director of the VA Ann
Arbor Healthcare System and vet-
eran ofthe U.S.Army, said the event
was all about camaraderie and hon-
oring the service members.
"It recognizes that it is more
'about ability than about dis-
ability, it recognizes the service
of those that participate in the
game, and I think it is just abso-
lutely the right thing to do,"
McDivitt said.

Coach apologizes for slur

Former Eastern
Mich. coach says he
regrets language
Former Eastern Michigan
football coach Ron English
expressed regret in an interview
with The Associated Press for
using "inappropriate language,"
that included a homophobic slur
during a film session with defen-
sive backs last month.
"As a man who has coached 21
years, obviously, on this occasion
and particular meeting, I lost my
poise,gotupset and usedlanguage
that was inappropriate, particu-
larly as it pertains to homosexual
slurs. I regret that," English told
the AP in a telephone interview on
Saturday, hours after the school
released a statement explaining
why he was firedthe previous day.
"I apologize to the university for
putting it in this position and tar-
nishing its reputation. I look for-
ward to continuing a career that
has been marked by molding men
of integrity, passion, and intensity
for 21 years."
Eastern Michigan athletic

director Heather Lyke, in astate-
ment released by the school Sat-
urday, said she received audio of
English using "wholly inappro-
priate language" while address-
ing the Eagles.
"We hold our coaches and staff
to high standards of professional-
ism and conduct and there is no
place, particularly in a student
environment, where this lan-
guage is appropriate," Lyke said.
"The statements made by Coach
English are absolutely unac-
ceptable. My decision to make a
change in leadership of our foot-
ball program was the culmina-
tion of a lot of factors including
the comprehensive review of our
program, the competitive perfor-
mance and this tape."
English was fired Friday with a
1-8 record this season and an 11-46
mark over five years at the Mid-
American Conference program.
When the school made its decision,
Lyke only said it was necessary to
make a change in leadership of the
football program.
With interim Stan Parrish,
the Eagles beat Western Michi-
gan 35-32 in overtime for their
second win of the season at home

with 2,177 people in attendance
in Ypsilanti, Mich.
"Our primary interest is in
the well-being and success of
our student-athletes and this
will continue to be our priority
in every decision we make and
every action we take," Lyke said
in her statement Saturday. "My
focus moving forward is on the
quality of our student-athletes'
experience as well as the search
process for the next leader of
our football program.
Eastern Michigan was struck
by tragedy on Oct. 18 when
Demarius Reed, a receiver from
Chicago, was found fatally shot
at an apartmentbuilding.
English was hired before the
2009 season, and the former
Michigan defensive coordinator
went 2-22 in his first two years
with the Eagles. Eastern Michigan
was 6-6 in 2011, falling one win
short of bowl eligibility because
two of its victories were against
Football Championship Subdivi-
sionteams.After snappingastreak
of 15 straight losing seasons, the
Eagles were 2-10 last year and lost
eight in a row this season before
beating the Broncos.

Maine congressman says he's gay

Michaud is seventh
openly gay member
of U.S. House
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -
When the intensely private Rep.
Mike Michaud laid bare his pri-
vate life and announced he's gay,
one openly gay congressman
joked that the Maine Democrat
had never registered on his "gay-
dar."
As he prepares to return to
Capitol Hill this week as the
seventh openly gay member of
the U.S. House, Michaud said
the decision to come out last
week was a positive experience
that drew support from fellow
congressmen and hundreds of
constituents - even if it was
political nastiness that prompt-
ed his announcement.
"People know me as Mike.
They know my issues are vet-
eran issues, economic develop-
ment, health care and jobs, and
nothing is going to change," he
said.
Michaud, who's engaged in

a three-way race for governor,
used an op-ed provided to two
newspapers and The Associated
Press to disclose he's gay, say-
ing he did so to address "whis-
per campaigns, insinuations and
push-polls" that raised ques-
tions about his sexuality.
He said constituents have
been supportive, with many
finding his honesty refreshing.
Several members of Congress
including Democratic Reps. Joe
Kennedy of Massachusetts and
David Cicilline of Rhode Island
have reached out to show sup-
port, as well.
Among them was Republi-
can Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida,
chairman of the Veterans Affairs
Committee, who works closely
with Michaud, the committee's
ranking Democrat.
"Mike Michaud is my friend
and colleague. He is a strong ally
in advocating for veterans and
his recent announcement does
nothing to change that," Miller
said.
Before Michaud's announce-
ment, there were six openly
gay members of the U.S. House.

Michaud's sexual orientation
was as much a surprise to at least
some of them as it was to Main-
ers.
Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo.,who
is gay, tweeted in surprise after
Michaud's announcement that
"My #gaydar missed it." He also
reached out to lend support.
"I conveyed to him that I felt
it was great that he has this load
off his shoulders and I know
he'll be an even more effective
servant for the people of Maine,"
he said.
Back in Maine, politi-
cal observers said Michaud's
announcement likely won't have
a big impact on the governor's
race. Voters here approved gay
marriage a year ago.
Michaud continued a regular
schedule of public events after
making his announcement. On
Friday, the Maine Association
of Police and the Professional
Fire Fighters endorsed Michaud
over Republican Gov. Paul LeP-
age, the incumbent, and wealthy
independent Eliot Cutler.
Michaud's sexual orientation
was never mentioned.

EVENT PREVIEW
Gross to give 40th
annual lecture

Copernicus series
to showcase variety
of lectures, films
By JOHN BOHN
Daily Community Culture Editor
In 1941, the Jedwabne massa-
cre occurred, which the collective
memory of Poland had held to be
the tragic death
of hundreds of Annual
Polish Jews by
German for- CpriCUS
es during the Lecture
Nazi occupa-
tion of Poland. Monday at
In 2000, histo- 5:30 p.m.
rian Jan Gross Helmut Stern
published his
landmark text Auditorium
"Neighbors: Free
The Destruc-
tion of the Jew-
ish Community in Jedwabne,
Poland", which reinvestigated the
role of non-Jewish Poles in the
massacre. Going against the grain
of national narratives of Polish
victimhood and martyrdom dur-
ing the World War II period, the
text was so controversial that it
sparked a national debate.
"When it was published ... it
was earth-shattering," said Pro-
gram Director of the Copernicus
Endowment for Polish Studies
Genevieve Zubrzycki. "I was in
Poland then and everyone was
talking about this. On the bus, in
cafes, in people's kitchen, on the
radio, on TV ... It was difficult for
a lot of people to take."
"You can say there is a Poland
before and after Jedwabne,"
Zubrzycki added. "And that does
not refer to the pogrom of '41,
but before the publication of that
book and the debate."
Monday, at 5:30 p.m., Jan Gross

will give the 40th annual Coper-
nicus Lecture, discussing his role
as both a writer of history and a
creator of history, with a text that
challenged national Polish identi-
ty. Gross, aware of the controver-
sial nature, went so far as to delay
translated publications of the text
so as to give the Polish govern-
ment time to respond.
The major response was
the creation of the Institute of
National Remembrance, which
spearheaded the reinvestigation
of the massacre. Reopening the
Jedwabne case, which had been
closed after a trial in 1949, gener-
ated heated dialogue among Pol-
ish politicians.
"(The Institute of National
Remembrance was) accused by
the right by saying, 'Why are you
studying crimes against Jews,
they were not Polish,' so taking
a very ethnic definition of the
nation," Zubrzycki said. "And
then the director of the Insti-
tute, responding taking a civic
definition, saying they were Pol-
ish citizens, they were citizens of
Poland, and therefore, this crime
was committed by Polish citi-
zens on Polish citizens."
The investigation went so far
as to examine the mass grave
at Jedwabne to determine the
actual number of deaths, which
the Chief Rabbi of Poland had
claimed was around 1,200. This
action itself was no simple mat-
ter. Jewish law prohibits the
digging up of the remains of its
people, and so, in order to go
through with the investigation,
it was necessary to excavate in a
way that didn't violate this law -
underscoring the impact of this
text.
In the end, the Polish govern-
ment established the Jedwabne
Memorial on July 10 of 2001,
with President Kwa'sniewski

admitting to the complicity of
ethnic Poles.
The Copernicus Lecture series
has been bringing well known
Polish figures, such as Jan Gross,
to the Ann Arbor area since the
Endowment's inception in 1973.
Past lecturers have included poet
Czeslaw Milosz, famed historian
of Marxism Leszek Kolakowski
and last year, award-winning
filmmaker Agnieszka Holland.
In 1999, commemorating the
10th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall, the Coperni-
can Endowment invited Polish
speakers from across the politi-
cal spectrum to discuss the event
at a round-table in Ann Arbor.
"Being here they were able to
meet and talk, which they would
never have been able to do in
Poland," Zubrzycki said.
All of which has garnered
Polish Studies at the University
quite the reputation.
"This is basically one of the
best Polish Studies programs in
North America," Zubrzycki said.
"It's a really vibrant program."
Polish Studies at the Universi-
ty cuts across disciplines, includ-
ing classes in Sociology, Political
Science, History, Screen Arts and
Culture and Slavic Languages.
As a result, the program is able
to, on occasion, craft courses and
events to coincide with the eclec-
tic Copernican Lecture series.
In addition to Holland's lecture,
the Polish Studies program also
hosted a film series reflective as
well as a mini-course dedicated
to Holland's cinematic contribu-
tions to Holocaust memory.
This year, to commemorate
the 40th anniversary of the
endowment, a variety of lectures
and film viewings have been
organized that will continue
throughout the Fall and Winter,
semesters.

Nonetheless, Overgrown is
the culmination of all of Blake's
artistic endeavors - a compel-
ling record that manages to
strike a newfound sentimental
chord with songs like "Retro-
grade." It's a surreal collection
of tracks that seemingly tran-
scends space and time while
still feeling undeniably enjoy-
able in any listening setting.
When asked how he would
hypothetically prefer to have a
person listen to Overgrown for
the first time, though, Blake
playfully described an elabo-
rate, English-centric scenario:
"I'd put them at the back of
the N29 bus from Wood Green
to Enfield Town," Blake said,
"and they'd be listening to it on
an iPhone with no headphones,
just through the iPhone speak-
ers. And it'd be a packed bus, so
they'd be obnoxiously playing
my album through it."

No one stood. As the
screen cut to a con-
clusive black and the
credits rolled, we stirred uncom-
fortably in our seats. Our eyes
sank toward

a pair of still
knees, and
though our
breaths were

ing hands

brief moments of just sitting
there, letting the finality sink
in - in the pause before we'd
get up and walk back into
our lives - no one wanted to
acknowledge what they had
just seen. This wasn't a trip
to the movie theater; it was a
front-row seat to that infamous
break in humanity, smeared in
history, one we've spent cen-
turies trying to forget. It took
a digital projector and a life-
less cinema hall seat to make
us remember, but there was
beauty in that.
The applause never came
because we didn't want to
judge.
In the week since "12 Years a
Slave" debuted at the Michigan
Theater, we've all heard the
exclamations of award-worthy
brilliance, decade-defining
cinematic quality and unvary-
ingly stirring acting. Every
review has been a gushing tes-
tament to how director Steve
McQueen's masterpiece per-
fectly gives voice to a forgotten
era. According to any worth-
while Oscar pundit, the race for
the golden statuettes is already
over, the time finally here for
a Black man to be deemed Best
Director by the Academy.
But here's the thing: This
movie is more than just a con-
sequence of the yearly exercise
in picking the best. It's accu-
rate - the most unyielding
depiction of the horrors of
slavery we've seen released
in this medium, and it doesn't
sympathize. It draws a clear
line between right and wrong,
and in doing so, sets itself apart
from many of the other pieces
of cinema that have tried to
tackle the same subject matter.
Most movies that attempt
to categorize race into two

Small-town joys in 'Nebraska'

By KAREN YUAN
For the Daily
"Nebraska," directed by Alex-
ander Payne ("The Descen-
dants"), feels like coming home.
Among all the chaos within and
around the universe, it seems to
say there will always be the father
and the son, driving along a wide,
open road, side by side watching
the asphalt tip into the horizon.

Woody Grant (Bruce Dern,
"Django Unchained"), a cantan-,

claiming he's the million-dollar
winner of Mega Sweepstakes
Marketing. He wrangles his sigh-
ing and head-shaking son David
(Will Forte, "Life of Crime")
into a Montana-Nebraska road
trip to collect his winnings, Don
Quixote-style. It's a journey to
top off a life. There's a scene,
right before the trip, where we
see Woody lying in a flea-bitten
couch, every line on his face vis-
ible in the film's monochrome
lensing. He almost becomes the
couch with the way he's sunk into
it, and the audience realizes this
is a man who needs purpose as
his life slowly curtains.
The trip is beautifully shot in
black and white. Their car rattles
along the infinity vistas of the
Midwest - plains stretching left
and right and flat tongues of roads
guiding the way - before making
a pit stop in Woody's hometown
Hawthorne. There, word quickly

The cooking series
that made us care
way too much
By KENDALL RUSS and
KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Daily ArtsEditors
The recipe for "MasterChef
Junior" shouldn't have worked.
Its formula was simple enough:
Take the tone and form of
cooking-competition series
"MasterChef", remove the adult
competitors, add tiny, prepubes-
cent "chefs" and leave Gordon
Ramsay.
Well, it worked. And then
some. With impressive ratings
(which rose a staggering 15 per-
cent for this week's final install-
ment), "MasterChef Junior"
became FOX's secret ingredient
this fall.
What's more, it made us
care a lot (read: more than we
ever thought we could pos-
sibly care) about snot-nosed,
privileged middle schoolers.
We're talking screaming-at-
our-televisions, live-tweeting-
until-our-thumbs-hurt levels
of caring. "MasterChef Junior"
broke us. "MasterChef Junior"
changed everything.
Before we jump into our anal-
ysis of the finale, a quick note:
What's the point? A Sarah-less,
Jack-less finale? We never want-
ed this! We never asked for this!
Jack (11, Hawaiian shirt aficio-
nado) was tragically eliminated
in the semifinal round, but we'll
never forget his intensely seri-
ous chopping face, his bite-sized
wisdom or, of course, those
adorable Hawaiian shirts. Sarah
(9, feminist icon) seemed des-
tined for the finale, the youngest
in the competition and the only
aspiring MasterChef Junior to
truly understand the nature of
the game ("Keep your friends
close and your enemies closer,"
she once mused with the deter-
mination of a "Hunger Games"
tribute).
But, alas, Friday's finale fea-
tured not tiny Jack Hoffman
nor Sarah "Whip it like a man"
Lane, but older child-chefs Dara
and Alexander. In the final chal-
lenge, both homecooks had to
prepare a three-course meal in
90 minutes at their battle sta-
tions, while past competitors
and their families cheered from
the sidelines.
We present to you some of
the particularly inspired notes
we took on our iPhones as we
watched the finale and played
our self-made "MasterChef
Junior" drinking game one last
time.*
"I hate blue cheese." - Flash-
back Dara
Two highlight reels of
Dara and Alexander moments
throughout the season remind
us Alexander was a frontrun-
ner from the start (boring) and
Dara inex-
plicably .
hates blue First seen on
cheese -the filter

(unforgivable). Do we have to
choose sides? Is this what the
show has come to without Jack
or Sarah? "Drink every time
Alexander is the worst" and
"Drink every time you have
a negative reaction to Data's
bow(s)" are rules in our drink-
ing game. Clearly, we're not
rooting for either of these lil
chefs to take the cake (and, yes,
drink for every bad culinary pun
made).
Big Al's menu: Shrimp & Baby
Heirloom Tomato Crostini,
Potato Gnocchi with a Pan-
seared Veal Chop, Decon-
structed Cannoli Napoleon
There aren't enough ellipses
in the world to possibly repre-
sent our reaction to Alexader
saying the words "deconstruct-
ed cannoli." Do we know what
that even is? No? Drink.
Dara's menu: Ahi Tuna, Spot
Prawns with Wonton Coco-
nut Curry, Poached Pear in a
Lemon Ginger Miso Sauce
Miso sauce in a dessert
sounds innovative to be sure.
But is it as innovative as a
deconstructed cannoli? We're
not sure. We still don't know
what that is.
ALEXANDER GIVES HER
FLOUR
Dara forgot to grab a key
ingredient, but Alexander will-
ingly hands her his own. These
children might have a vicious
appetite for winning, but they
still have hearts.
DARA IS LIGHTHEADED.
COMMERCIAL. AHHHHH
Oh, she just needed water.
She's fine, everyone.
WHAT IS POKE?
For her appetizer, Dara pre-
pared tuna two ways: seared
(got it) and poke (what?). One
of our drinking-game rules is
to drink every time a child-chef
uses a word we University-
attending adults do not under-
stand (past examples: ganache,
acidulate). Drink for poke.
Way to go Dara, that's a $25
appetizer in Manhattan
The judges tell Dara her two-

- Luca Manfe (paraphrased)
Previous "MasterChef"
winner Luca Manfd inserts
commentary throughout the
finale that makes us a tad wor-
ried about his self-esteem. The
Italian chef doubts his cooking

could hold a candle to that of
these kids. At one point, he even
says: "I don't know how these
kids can handle this situation
so young. I can barely handle
myself." Is he talking about han-
dling his kitchen? His entire
life? Is Luca Manfe spiraling in
front of our eyes? Can someone
check up on him?

correctly pronounces "gnoc-

of our friends watching this
with us.

period, and it seems like we have
a very close race on our hands.
The words "bloody phenom-
enal" were thrown out about
Alexander's deconstructed can-
noli (still sounds more like an
art installation than a dessert),
but Chef Gordon Ramsay also
told Dara he wants to give her

tion.

ner." - Gordon Ramsay

Unfortunately, there were

several dramatic pauses, the

ed (finally). The dynamic and

"MasterChef Junior" came to a
disappointingly vanilla ending.

Alexander walks away with
$100,000, presumably to put
toward culinary school or the
restaurant he wants to one day

their lives figured out?!). Run-

Sp or Monday

Nebraska running back Ameer Abdullah (top) ran for 105 yards againt the Michigan defense. Fifth-year senior running back Fit: Toussaint (left) was held to just six yards on nine carries. Redshirt Junior quarterback Devin Gardner was again
sacked seven times. Once again, Michigan's rushing offense lost more yards than it gained, including sacks, as the Michigan football team continues its struggles in Big Ten play.

Five Things We
Learned
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
1. Hoke will defend Borges until
the bitter end.
Al Borges may well be the
most talked about man in Ann
Arbor, but not in a good way.
Calls for the offensive coordi-

nator's firing started with Michi-
gan's first loss to Penn State last
month. They became a little
louder after the Michigan State
loss, and they've reached their
peak now that the Wolverines
had their second consecutive
week of negative rushing yards.
After Saturday's game,
though, Hoke said he approved
of Borges's calls.
"I liked the play calling," Hoke
said. "We thought we could do
some things, and we didn't."
Michigan made no attempt to

change its game plan from last
week to thisweek, as it continued
to run the ball when the running
backs - fifth-year senior Fitzger-
ald Toussaint and freshman Der-
rick Green - couldn't find any
space.
Borges clearly thinks he's
making the right decision, and
Hoke justified the play calling,
saying that the execution and
poor coaching has more to do
with it than anything else.
That implies that Hoke
believes in the current game

plan, and that he intends to keep
up with the same played-out
scene until the Wolverines find
some way to master it. It's just
uncertain if there's enough time
left for that to happen.
2. It's November, and turnovers
are still an issue.
Remember three games ago
when the biggest question mark
for the Wolverines was if red-
shirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner could throw the ball

without it falling neatly into the
hands of an opponent?
That's hardly the case any-
more. Now, the bigger issue for
Michigan is how to capitalize
when it's on the receiving end of
a turnover.
The Wolverines had two gold-
en opportunities to score on Sat-
urday, one set by fifth-year senior
linebacker Cam Gordon forcing a
fumble to put the Wolverines at
the Nebraska 33-yard line, and
another where Dennis Norfleet
recovered a muffed punt on the

Nebraska 26-yard line.
And as a thank you for those
two gifts graciously given to it,
the Michigan offense went 1-for-
2 on field-goal attempts to cap off
those drives.
The problem to score has been
categorized as offensive ineffec-
tiveness. But when you're actu-
ally moving backward on a drive;
that's not ineffectiveness, it's self
destruction. The bottom line is,
when even the kickers aren't put
in a position to succeed, itunder-

Running game
loses yards, again

A broken streak, a
broken team

Michigan follows
negative 48-yard
performance with
negative 21 yards
By ZACH HELFAND
Doily Sports Editor
Somehow, after all the lost
yardage, the sacks, the runs up

the middle into walls of defend-
ers -followed by more runs into
more walls of defenders - the
Michigan football team still had
a chance to win the game against
Nebraska on Saturday. And at
the start of the fourth quarter,
Nebraska handed the Wolverines
one hell of a chance.
With the game tied, 10-10,
Nebraska return man Jordan
Westerkamp muffed a punt,
which bounced right into the

arms of sophomore wide receiver
Dennis Norfleet. Norfleetcruised
into the end zone, but it was for
naught - the kicking team can-
not advance a muffed punt. Still,
Michigan gained 50 yards on the
play, double its next-longest play
of the game. Now, just 26 yards
separated the Wolverines from
the end zone.
But it might as well have been
a mile. Michigan's first two plays
See NEGATIVE, Page 3B

Brady Hoke has always
shied away from ques-
tions about
his 19-game
winning
streak at
Michigan
Stadium,
but there
was always
a smile LIZ
behind his VUKELICH

eyes when he said the record
didn't matter - though he
never would admit it, Hoke
always seemed proud of the
streak that he had built.
Now that unbeaten streak -
the one thing the Wolverines
still had to play for despite all
their struggles this season - is
gone. And after Saturday's loss
against Nebraska, Hoke finally
showed some emotion when
talking about one of the big

things that's defined his tenure
in Ann Arbor.
"Any winning streak... "
Hoke paused as he searched for
words. "You're disappointed
when it's not there."
The home streak isn't the
only thing that isn't there any-
more, though. A lot of other
things seemed to break on
Saturday too - things bigger
and more significant than never

NO ANSWERS
It's unrealistic to expect Michigan to be
a powerhouse in 2013. But is it realistic to
expect answers from its coach? SportsMon-
day Column: Page 2B


2B - November 11, 2013

The Michigan Daily - michiganclaily.com,

f a ar i oeAe COLUMN
Ifthere are answers, time to share them*

The questions were mostly
the same at Brady Hoke's
postgame press confer-
ence this week, but the buzz-
word had changed. Last week,
execution was
to blame for
Michigan's
29-6 loss to
Michigan'
State, for the J"
negative 48
rushing yards.
This week? ZACH
Hoke just hasZHELFAND
to do a better
job coaching
this football
team. How does everyone know
this? He said so himself. Seven
times in less than 13 minutes.
How do you explain all the
negative rushing yards, he was
asked?
Last week, he responded, "We
didn't execute as well as they
did."
This week, "Well, it's hard to
explain, isn't it?" Hoke said. "I've
got to do a better job coaching
those guys."
How do you keep Devin's spir-
its up after seven sacks?
"His spirits will be up because
he's a competitor," Hoke said.
"He's goingto be sore, and that's
part of it. Again, I have to do a
better job coaching."
What kind of adjustments
were you hoping to make?
"There were a number of
things that we have to do a better
job coaching the kids on," Hoke
said.
What did you think of Mary
Sue Coleman's speech, coach?
"I have to doa better job
coaching," Hoke said.
OK, that last one was fake. But
it poses an interesting question:
in a famously insular profession,
does a coach owe answers to
anyone?
First, let's be clear about a few
things. One, this is an admirable,

back, too. For 19-to 22-year-olds,
that hurts.
"Whoever questions our
toughness, they can shove it,"
said redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner on Saturday.
And good for him - question-
ing a team's toughness is a cheap
analysis, especially when it's
abundantly clear that Michigan
simply isn't as good as many of
its opponents. Try to find a team
that has won despite a bad offen-
sive line. It just doesn't happen.
But without any clear direc-
tion from Michigan's leader
- without acknowledgingthe
flaws and how to fix them - the
center falls apart. And the fans
take it upon themselves to offer
solutions. Now, Michigan has
lost three of its last four because
Hoke doesn't wear a headset.
Or because the team isn't tough
enough.
In his first two seasons, Hoke
answered these complaints on
the field. This year, that hasn't
happened.
So does Hoke owe anything
to the fan base? Maybe - it's
unrealistic for anyone to expect
results in Hoke's third year with
a bare cupboard at offensive line.
The self-deception goes both
ways.
But providing an honest -
assessment of his team is prob-
ably worth the trouble for Hoke.
That's possible without throwing
anyone under the bus.
At his press conference, Hoke
was finally asked where, specifi-
cally, he had to do a better job
coaching the team.
"Just - everything," he said.
Had that answer been broad-
cast over the Michigan Stadium
scoreboards, it's not hard to
imagine it would've drawn
cheers. And not the sincere kind.

Michigan coach Brady Hoke has admirably taken the blame for Saturday's 17-13 loss to Nebraska, but the Michigan football team's problems go deeper than that.

if frustrating, response from the
leader of a football team. Hoke is
asking to shoulder all the blame.
His porous offensive line is still
too young and hasn't progressed.
The defense missed an assign-
ment late, which allowed the
final touchdown. Nebraska's
players said they could predict
Michigan's plays before the snap.
Hoke wants responsibility for
it all.
And this isn't anything new.
Typically, football coaches are
about as forthcoming as a pile of
bricks, especially after a game.
On that spectrum, Hoke is like a
brick somewhere right above the
bottom of that pile. He'll prob-
ably be more willing to share at
his Monday press conference.

But without any answers
before the game, with no
answers on the field and very
few explanations afterward, the
customers were not happy. After
a stretch of near silence, Michi-
gan Stadium finally came alive
with a murmur Saturday. The
murmur began to crescendo, and
soon all corners of the stadium
were cheering, and then they
were standing for the first time
all game.
It was late in the first quarter,
and Michigan had just gained its
first first down of the game. The
112,204 in attendance - polite
Midwestern folk - had turned
sarcastic. The cheer, derisive.
By now, the rest is familiar.
Reality handed offensive coor-

dinator Al Borges a bunch of
lemons, and he continued to try
to turn them into hot chocolate
by running his backs into a wall
of defenders. The interior line
continued to look like what you'd
expect from a freshman, a red-
shirt freshman and a redshirt
sophomore. The defense cracked
on a late fourth down, and
Nebraska won ugly, 17-13.
Hoke heard the sarcastic
cheering, and he later heard a
smattering of boos.
"Well, that's you know, that's
the way things are," he said.
But he hasn't helped his case,
either. Consider the circum-
stances: those fans with the
sarcastic cheering- and later
with a smattering of boos - they

pay an average of $230 per ticket,
according to Forbes. Those same
fans later go on message boards
proposing to fire the coach, the
offensive coordinator, the offen-
sive coordinator's secretary and,
hell, that secretary's great aunt
Sally, for good measure. This is
college football. What's sanity?
Those things trickle back to
the team, hurt recruiting and
begin to create a toxic atmo-
sphere. These things matter.
Rich Rodriguez's fatal flaw was
that he couldn't unite Michigan's
alumni and fan base, right?
When a high-profile ESPN
column (rather foolishly) calls
Michigan's quarterback and
freshman running back soft and
its left tackle lazy, that trickles

Soccer loses Big Bear Trophy

By MINH DOAN
Daily Sports Writer
In a rivalry game, physical-
ity is a given and fouls aren't an
uncommon occurrence either.
But of all the things the Michi-
gan men's soccer team expected
to happen in a rivalry game,
playing a man down was prob-
ably not one of them.
With Michigan State's lead-
ing scorer, forward Tim Kreutz,
streaking
down the MICHIGAN 0
field on MSU 2
a break-
away in the 60th minute, Michi-
gan sophomore defender Jack
Brown came from behind, slide
tackled to get the ball and took
down Kreutz in the process.
Brown was handed a red card,
forcing the Wolverines to play a
man down.
After the red card, the Wol-
verines "clicked off," according
to senior goalie Adam Grinwis,
as they went down 1-0 before
conceding another goal one
minute later en route to a 2-0
loss. Not only did the Wolverines
(3-3 Big Ten, 8-6-3 overall) lose
the Big Bear Trophy, given to
the winner of the annual rivalry
game, but they also missed a
chance at securing an at-large
bid into the NCAA Tournament.
No one could have predicted
the outcome of the game after
Michigan dominated the first
half in a convincing fashion.
The Wolverines had 10 shots on
goal while not allowing the 18th-
ranked Spartans (3-2-1, 10-4-3)
to rattle off even one shot.
"We came out flying because
we knew what was stake," Grin-
wis said. "Not only was it a local
derby, but also had huge NCAA
and Big Ten Tournament impli-
cations."
Not being able to finish their
chances has been Michigan's
Achilles' heel all season, and it
was evident in the first half.
"When you go away to play
against an instate rival, clearly
dominate a half and have noth-
ing to show for it, it's very frus-
trating," Grinwis said.
In the 18th minute, redshirt
sophomore midfielder Colin
McAtee had the ball inside the

0

six-yard box. After weaving
around to look for a clear shot,
he found an opportunity and
took a crack at the ball. His low
shot from the right side went
across the goal mouth and to the
left side of the net, just missing
the target.
Michigan had its best chance
in the 23rd minute when
senior midfielder Fabio Pereira
received the ball on the left flank
and dribbled down the touch-
line. As a Michigan State defend-
er came to take away the ball,
Pereira weaved his way past the
defender before cutting inside
to the six-yard box. Zach Ben-
nett, the Spartans' goalkeeper,
came out to cut off the angle and
Pereira tried to chip it over Ben-
nett's head. Bennett got a hand
on the ball and barely stopped
the ball from going into the goal.
After the halftime break, it
was clear something said in the
Spartan locker room ignited
them, as they came out and pep-
pered Grinwis with six quick
shots. Meanwhile, the Wolver-
ines could only muster one in the
first 15 minutes.
"We couldn't come out play-
ing the same we were playing,
and credit to Michigan State
who really put us on the back
foot," Grinwis said.
The red card given in the
second half drastically changed

the game and tilted the posses-
sion battle toward the Spartans
as the Wolverines sat back to
defend.
Only a minute after the red
card, a cross sent in by Michigan
State midfielder Sean Conerty
found the head of midfielder
Kyle Rutz, who unleashed a
header 15 yards from the goal
into the back of the net.
Less than three minutes after
the first goal, a Michigan foul
inside the box led to a penalty
kick for the Spartans. Michigan
State midfielder Fatai Alashe
stepped up to take the kick and
placed it into the left corner of
the goal,just away from the hand
of Grinwis. It ended any hope for
a Wolverine comeback and put
Michigan's NCAA Tournament
hopes on hold for another week.
"We need a solid turnout in
the Big Ten Tournament next
week to make the NCAA Tour-
nament now," Grinwis said. "I
think we need to go into the
tournament definitely needing
to win the first game, and most
likely winning the semifinal
game."
Note: Michigan fresh-
man defender Lars Eckenrode
received his fifth yellow card
of the season and is suspended
from the Wolverines' Big Ten
Tournament opener against
Indiana due to accumulation.

With a roster full of inexpe-
rienced players, the Michigan
women's basketball team entered
its season with more questions
than answers. But after the
team's first two games of the sea-
son, it is clear that it can succeed
in late-game situations.
The Wolverines fell to Bowl-
ing Green, 63-52, in the first
game of the Iona Tournament
on Friday, but defeated Arizona
in overtime Saturday, 73-71. Key
late-game plays were the differ-
ence for Michigan in its first win
of the season.
Against Arizona, the Wol-
verines found themselves down
by two with two seconds left in
regulation after squandering a
six-point halftime lead. The Wol-
verines forced a jumpball and set
up to inbound the ball with one
last opportunity to leave New
Rochelle, N.Y. with a win.
Junior guard Shannon Smith
inbounded the ball to junior for-
ward Cyesha Goree, who sank a
turnaround jumper to send the
game to overtime. Goree, who
played limited minutes last sea-
son, was the number one option
on the inbounds play and capi-
talized, proving herself as a valu-
able option in crunch time.
"She wanted the ball, that was
incredible," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "She really
wanted the ball. We were excited
she made the shot."
The Wolverines didn't imme-
diately capitalize on the momen-
tum of the bqzzer-beater, falling
behind early in the overtime

Junior forward Cyesha Goree made her first career start on Friday. She finished with 19 points comhined in two tames against Bowling Green and Arizona.

period until Smith and freshman
guard Paige Rakers hit back-to-
back 3-pointers to give Michigan
a 73-69 lead with 1:40 left in the
extra session. But Arizona cut
the lead to two again, and junior
guard Nicole Elmblad - who
was named the team's captain
the day before - needed to block
a piece of the ball on the Wild-
cats' final attempt to tie the game
to ensure the Wolverine victory.
Friday's game was a different
story for Michigan. The Falcons

jumped out to an 18-5 lead in the
first six minutes of the game,
digging the Wolverines an early
hole.
Though Michigan battled
back throughout the first half, it
never took the lead despite cut-
ting the deficit to two in the first
half. Each Wolverine run was
countered by a Bowling Green
response, and the Falcons took
an eight-point lead into the half.
Michigan kept the game in single
digits for parts of the second half

but could never get much closer
than that.
"If we would've come out with
a little bit more fire, we think it
would've been a different game,"
Elmblad said.
Smith led the Wolverines in
scoring over the weekend, post-
ing team highs with 17 points
Friday and 21 on Saturday in her
first games against Division I
competition in two years. Fresh-
man guard Siera Thompson was
the second-leading scorer for

Michigan, scoring 12 points each
game.
Though the Wolverines ended
the weekend 1-1, they feel as
though the ending of Saturday's
game is something they can
build off of.
"This team is really just ready
to fight, no matter what," Elm-
blad said. "When the going gets
tough, we're going to fight back
and stick together, and hopefully
give ourselves a chance to win
games."

mines everything the coaching
staff has preached about capital-
izing on turnovers.
3. The defense looks like the lone
bright spot.
Cam Gordon and Courtney
Avery were asked an interesting
question after the game. As fifth-
year seniors, they weathered the
Rich Rodriguez era that, among
other things, was criticized for
its porous defense. So, how does
it feel to be on the other side of
things this season?

They,of course, responded that
football is a team game, so their
performance doesn't count for
much. But when Hoke was asked
about any bright spots he saw in
the game, he cited the defense -
specifically, how it held the Husk-
ers to 6-for-16 on third downs.
Sure, that's ignoring the fact
that the Wolverines gave up
a critical 4th-and-two late in
the fourth quarter, but overall,
things are alot less iffy when the
defense is on the field. It just begs
the question of how long it will
take Michigan to have an electric
offense and a stout defense at the
same time.
4. Michigan needs to stick with

short passing routs.
Could it be just three weeks
ago that fifth-year senior wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon dazzled
everyone with his record-break-
ing day in receiving yards against
Indiana?
Gallon's been something of a
ghostly figure for the Wolverines
as of late. And that may continue,
as Michigan seemed to be more
effective short routs on Satur-
day compared to the long ones to
Gallon - fifth-year senior run-
ning back Fitzgerald Toussaint
and sophomore tight end Devin
Funchess thrived most on short
screen passes.
With Gardner facing a sack

each time he steps back into the
pocket to throw, these kind of
passes just make more sense.
Since the run game is in a rut and
these are the kind of passing plays
that Michigan can successfully
execute, it's not unreasonable to
expect to see more of them going
forward.
5. Bold Prediction: Michigan will
lose out.
Even if the Wolverines were
playing up to their full potential,
Ohio State was always going to
be the toughest team they faced
all season. At this point, a victory
over the Buckeyes would be noth-
ing short of miraculous.

But Michigan still has two
weekstogobefore OhioStaterolls
into town, and there is very little
to suggest that it will come out of
those two weeks unscathed.
The Wolverines are three-
point underdogs against North-
western next week, and just for a
frame of reference, the Wildcats
are winless in the Big Ten this
season. Northwestern has never-
been favored over Michigan. But
that day has finally arrived.
Iowa, too, has been a medio-
cre team this season. But never
underestimate the Wolverines'
poor road performances. In a sea-
son labeled as Big Ten title or bust
by Michigan, it has become the
latter.

NEGATIVE
From Page 1B
of the drive, rushes from
freshman running back Der-
rick Green, were swarmed by
defenders. The two plays lost a
yard, and now Michigan faced a
situation that has become all too
familiar: 3rd and long.
Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner could only mus-
ter a four-yard scramble. The
Michigan.Stadium crowd booed
loudly. The field-goal attempt
by fifth-year senior Brendan
Gibbons squeaked off the right
upright and in.
Michigan led, but by three
instead of seven. Once again,
negative plays tanked Michigan
in a key situation. The Huskers
would win the game on the next
drive.
The good news for the Wol-
verines in their 17-13 loss to
Nebraska is that they improved
on their record-setting nega-
tive 48 rushing yards from last
weekend. The bad news is that
all 112,204 fans in attendance
had zero rushing yards, still
more than Michigan for the sec-
ond week in a row.
And those in attendance
knew it. After Michigan's first
first down, with 2:45 remaining
in the first quarter, the stadium
erupted in sarcastic cheering.
For the second straight week,
the Wolverines were running
backward more often than not.
They finished with negative 21
rushing yards this time. And
once again, Michigan couldn't
find an offensive rhythm.
"The negative plays are what
kill you on third down," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
Michigan ran the ball 36
times (including sacks, which
count as a rushing attempt in the
statistics). Of those 36, five went
for no gain. Eight lost yards.

Seven were sacks. In all, more
than half of Michigan's attempts
on the ground went backward,
or at least failed to go forward.
This wasn't three yards and
a cloud of dust, because Michi-
gan rarely even advanced the
ball that far on the ground. The
ball carrier picked up at least
three yards on just 22 percent
of the team's rushes. More often
than not, the cloud of dust was
behind the line of scrimmage.
Not surprisingly, Michigan
went just 3-of-15 on third down.
That's probably because Michi-
gan's average distance was 3rd
and nine. For the second week
in a row, the coaching staff was
left searching for answers for a
rushing game that has combined
for negative 69 yards in the past
two weeks.
"Well that's hard to explain,
isn't it?" Hoke said. He then
repeated a line he used often
in his post-game press confer-
ence. "I've got to do a better job
coaching those guys."
Running was futile. Fittingly,
the game started where Michi-
gan had left off against Michi-
gan State: with a rush up the
middle to fifth-year senior run-
ning back Fitzgerald Toussaint
for a loss of one.
Toussaint finished with six
yards on nine carries. Green had
11 yards on eight. The longest
rush of the day was seven yards.
Gardner threw for 196 yards
and a touchdown, without any
turnovers, but passing was also
a gamble. Gardner was sacked
on 20 percent of his drop backs,
seven times in all for the second
week in a row.
He was sacked twice on his
second drive, setting up 4th and
30. He was sacked on fourth
down in the second quarter. A
third-down sack of Gardner set
up the punt that Westerkamp
would muff. And another sack
on third down on Michigan's

last possession helped end the
game.
"I think maybe a few plays
I did hold onto it a little long,"
Gardner said.
In all, Michigan failed to gain
any yardage on slightly less than
half of its plays.
Norfleet, the would-be hero,
lingered on the bench after
the game. As time expired, his
teammates quickly made for the
tunnel. But Norfleet stayed for a
moment, alone on the bench.
He had the game's momen-
tum-changing play in his grasp,
but the rules prevented him
from scoring. Instead, the game
was in the hands of the Michi-
gan offense - in this case, the
running game specifically. And
in this game, again, that meant it
was more likely to go the wrong
way.

The team's levelheadedness
is broken.
Hoke looked defeated and

game. The players were exas-
perated when asked the same
questions about where Michi-
gan's fundamental problems
are stemming from. Anger
flashed in Devin Gardner's eyes
as he defend-

were replaced with sarcastic
cheers.
There are always going to
be critics. But the fact that
some of the loudest cheers in
the stadium on Saturday came
when Michigan successfully
completed a pass? That says
something.
The Wolverines have looked
so disheveled and inconsistent
in their past four games that
maybe it's surprising things

asked about
what remains forthe team now
that locker-room morale has to
be at an all-time low.
"Things are still out there to
be won," Gordon said.
Things. There are "things"
to be won.
For the first time, Michigan
has had to lose its rhetoric that
a Big Ten championship is still
possible - that pipe dream,
though a long shot considering
the Wolverines' performance
the past two weeks, was finally
mathematically eliminated on
Saturday.
That was the goal Michigan
never believed was too far out
of reach. Now, what it has to
play for is something as won-
derfully vague as "things."
The fans' optimism is bro-
ken, too.
Boos echoed around the Big

No one would argue Michi-

so petty now, especially as the
Wolverines have just three
more games to fix the problems
in their machine, find an iden-
tity and maybe salvage a little
bit of their pride that's slipped
further and further out of their
grasp.
Hoke is already talking about
getting back to practice, as if
the start of another week will
be enough of a Band-Aid to help
Michigan recover from this
loss.
But when something is as
broken as this team looks,
maybe a Band-Aid as small as
another week to work things

5 Things We Learned: UMass Lowell

0

0'

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
1. The starting lineup, for one
thing.
The key element in Michigan
coach John Beilein's new starting
lineup was the decision to put an
extra wing on the floor in lieu of
two big men.
That meant fifth-year senior
center Jordan Morgan, who start-
ed both exhibition games along-
side redshirt junior Jon Horford,
began the game on the bench and
played just 12 minutes in Friday's
69-42 win over UMass Lowell. By
comparison, Horford saw nearly
double thattime as the starter.
After sophomore guard Spike
Albrecht started the first exhi-
bition game at point guard, it
appeared as though the sopho-
more might see more playingctime
over freshman Derrick Walton
rat least thefrs ,waekorsoe.

But Walton started the second
exhibition game and got the nod
in the season opener, playing 27
minutes to Albrecht's 12. The
distribution of minutes showed
that there may not be anything
resembling a time share and that
Albrecht is simply a capable back-
up point guard.
Sophomores Caris LeVert, Nik
Stauskas and Glenn Robinson III
rounded out the rest of the start-
ing lineup.
"That's a lineup that you'll
probably see quite a bit out there
at different times as we wait
for Mitch (McGary) to return,"
Beilein said.
2. Caris LeVert is too good to keep
on the bench.
Central to that determination
to scrap the two-big men plans
in favor of a smaller lineup was
LeVert. He flipped spots with
Moazara an nr.e.aseintod-uca-

tions, getting his name called on
the loudspeaker while Morgan
lined up on the side to high-five
the starters. The roles had been
reversed for the two exhibition
games.
"As we went through this
thing, we had 30 practice days
trying to find some way to play
with two big guys," Beilein said.
"Really, it wasn't about that. It
was about Caris LeVert. Let's get
him on the floor any way that we
can."
LeVert outscored every per-
son in Crisler Center on Friday,
totaling 17 points on 11 shots and
pulling down five rebounds. He
highlighted the night with a slick
up-and-under move, finishing on
the right side of the rim and get-
ting fouled for the and-one.
"His quickness, his second
dribble, he just explodes by peo-
ple," Beilein said. "And then you
complement that with a really
solid 3-noint shot"

LeVert made Beilein look like a
smart man on Friday.
3. There's no established, give-
me-the-ball scorer.
There are scorers on Michigan,
but as of now, no one with the
assassin-type mentality to take
and make the bigshot.
Robinson is probably the most
talented scorer on the roster, but
his game relies on open space,
and not so much a 1-on-1 game.
He's able to throw down the
alley-oop or exploit a mismatch to
drive past a defender or crash the
offensive boards with a put-back.
But his ability to break down a
defender from the perimeter to
create a jump shot is less devel-
oped.
Other options are Stauskas or
LeVert, but at this point, they're
unproven in those situations.
The weakness manifested
in the first half when the Wol-
verines couldn't buy a field goal
after jumping out to an 8-0 lead.
Missed layups, tentative shooting
and ill-advised 3-pointers hurt
Michigan as the River Hawks tied
the game going into halftime.
"It was a stagnant first half,
that's for sure," Beilein said. "The
offense had to make a couple
shots. The guys that are out there
on that floor right now, they had
a couple good games, but they
never had to make those big
plays in games that Trey (Burke)
and Tim (Hardaway Jr.) used to
always make."
4. Derrick Walton is no Trey
Burke, but you knew that.
Clearly. Of course.
Still, there was Ac rtzinty
over just how impressive Walton
would be. To what extent could
he approach Burke's level of play
as a freshman? What would he be
able to bring to the table?
Through two exhibitions
and one regular season game,
the answer seems to be "a good
amount."
Walton has been just as
impressive as Burke on defense,
being found guilty of copyright
infringement of Burke's patented

steal in the backcourt as the ball-
handler tries to turn away from
the defender while switching the
ball hand.
offensively, there's less pol-
ish. Walton, while quick, isn't as
dynamic in transition and hasn't
proven himself to be as consistent
of a finisher near the rim. He has
also yet to reign in the concept of
pace. Burke made himself an elite
point guard by changing speeds
and keeping the defense off bal-
ance. Though it may have been
because of opening-night nerves,
Walton seemed to be going at 100
miles per hour at all times. He
finished with four points on 1-for-
4 shooting, four assists and one
turnover.
5. Bold prediction: Barring injury,
the starting lineup won't change
by New Year's.
It seems that the experimental
phase of Beilein's futzing with the
lineup is over with. That is, until
Mitch McGary returns from his
back injury. But the implication
of this prediction is that I don't
expect McGary to be back until
Big Ten season in January.
It's looking like LeVert, Staus-
kas and Robinson are the best
players on the team, so there'd

be little pressure to remove them
from the starting lineup. Keeping
those three means that there's
only one big man on the floor
in addition to the point guard.
Though freshman forward Zak
Irvin might be good enough to
start, there's simply no room in
the starting lineup for him.
It seems unlikely that Wal-
ton would lose his starting spot
given the allocation of minutes
between him and Albrecht in the
first game. It would take some
considerable struggles by Wal-
ton in the first month or two for
Beilein to make a change. Pulling
the Michigan point guard of the
future out of the starting lineup
would be damaging to the young-
ster's confidence.
Only center remains, and it 0
seems to be the position most
susceptible to a lineup change.
Horford won the starting job, and
he rebounds better than Morgan,
pulling down 12 boards in the
opener. Neither is very dynamic
on offense. Morgan runs the floor
better, but Horford misses fewer
easy shots. If, in his senior season,
Morgan didn't win the starting
position by the opener, it seems
unlikely that he would do so later
on unless the incumbent is par-
ticularly incompetent.
