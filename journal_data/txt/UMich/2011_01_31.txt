After U.S.travel

By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
In the midst of almost week-
long anti-government protests in
Egypt, four University students
studying abroad in Cairo and
Alexandria prepared to evacu-
ate the country today as the Uni-
versity cancelled its Cairo-based
study abroad program.
Two University students and
one student from the Univer-
sity's Flint campus were study-
ing at the American University.
in Cairo through the University's
Center for Global and Intercul-
tural Study, and four University
students were studying at Alex-
andria University with a non-
University affiliated program,
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said last night.
Two of the students in Cairo
- who have been staying at two
separate American University in
Cairo dormitories - willbe evac-

uated today on a charter flight
to Athens before they fly back
to the United States, Fitzgerald
said. One student, meanwhile,
has been staying with her grand-
parents and will remain in Cairo
and plans to directly re-enroll
in classes at AUC after classes
resume. According to the AUC
website, classes have been can-
celled this week.
Demonstrators and looters
continue to quarrel with police
and military forces on the streets
of Cairo and other Egyptian
cities, demanding democratic
elections and protesting against
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who has been in power
for nearly 30 years.
Fitzgerald said the University
cancelled the program at AUC
after the U.S. State Department
issued a travel warning to Egypt
yesterday.
"(This is), consistent with the
University's policy of not hav-
ing study abroad programs in
countries where there are travel
warnings," Fitzgerald said.
The University was initially
unaware there were University
students besides those in Cairo
in the country as the students

About 80 gather on
Diag to denounce
Mubarak
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
"Mubarak, Mubarak, what
do you say? How many people
jailed today?"
So went one of the many
chants voiced by protesters on
the Diag Friday afternoon.

Starting at 3:30 p.m., around
80 people - including repre-
sentatives from several stu-
dent organizations - gathered
in the Diag to protest Egypt's
long-standing President Hosni
Mubarak and his regime.
The protest on campus came
in response to reports of civil
unrest in Egypt over the past
few days, with a wave of citizen
protests calling for Mubarak's
resignation. In response to
protesters, Mubarak's admin-
istration has reportedly set a

nationwide curfew as well as
shut down the country's Inter-
net and cell phone services.
During a televised press con-
ference Friday morning, U.S.
Secretary of State Hilary Clin-
ton criticized the Egyptian gov-
ernment for its reported use of
violence against protesters.
"The Egyptian government
needs to understand that vio-
lence will not make these griev-
ances go away," Clinton said.
To address the issue, Univer-
sity students took to the Diag.

Though University police
officers were stationed on the
Diag to monitor the protests,
police said they were only
there as a precautionary mea-
sure. And the demonstration
occurred without police inter-
vention.
Mohamed Mattar, an Engi-
neering junior and president of
the University's Egyptian Stu-
dents Association, said at the
event he's happy Egyptian citi-
zens have chosen to rise up and

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
For the Daily
Business leaders, foreign
investors and professorsfromthe
University and abroad addressed

key issues regarding business in
Asia during panel discussions
at the 21st annual Asia Business
Conference at the Ross School of
Business this past weekend.
The conference is the lon-
gest-running business confer-

States that is organized by stu-
dents. Business graduate student
Rama Ghanta, who co-chaired
this year's conference, said the
primary purpose is to educate
students and others about "the

challenges of doing business in
Asia."
"Being aware of the changes
in Asia is very important to stu-
dents," Ghanta said.
The conference originally
focused on Japan - and was
called Japan Day - when it start-
ed 21 years ago. However, the
conference has now expanded to
encompass discussions of multi-

SUNDANCE IN A2

E-mail reveals Columbia students' grades

A leaked document revealed that
for the fall 2010 semester, at least 8
percent of undergraduate students
at Columbia University received
consistent As or A pluses, according
to a Jan. 27 article in the Columbia
Spectator.
An advising dean leaked the
information to students through an
e-mail mistake, and the Columbia
Spectator received the document
last Wednesday, according to the
article. The document also includ-
ed the names and other academic
information of the 482 students on
the list, the article states.
Of the 482 students who had a
4.0 grade point average or higher,
372 were part of Columbia College
and 110 were in the School of Engi-

neering and Applied Sciences. The
class of 2011 had the highest num-
ber of students - with 156 on the
list - compared to the other three
classes.
BRISTOL PALIN PREVENTED
FROM SPEAKING AT
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY
Washington University in St.
Louis decided to cancel a scheduled
abstinence talk by Bristol Palin,
the daughter of former Alaska Gov.
Sarah Palin, during its upcoming
"sex week," according to a Jan. 28
article in The St. Louis Post-Dis-
patch.
The decision came after Wash-
ington University students criti-

cized the decision to pay Palin
several thousand dollars in funds
provided by students for her
appearance, The St. Louis Post-Dis-
patch reported.
Hundreds of people signed a
Facebook petition advocating for
Palin to not be on the event's panel,
according to The St. Louis Post-

Thousands ofVenezuelans
evacuate after arms explosion

5 Somalians brought
to S. Korea for trial

Causes unknown,
officials ponder
sabotage
MAACAY, Venezuela (AP) -
A fire and a series of explosions
tore through a military arms
depot yesterday, killing one per-
son and leading authorities to
evacuate thousands of people.
About 10,000 residents were
removed to safety from areas up
toseveral miles (kilometers) from
the site as the burning ammuni-
tion produced powerful blasts,
officials said. The cause of the
pre-dawn fire was unclear.
Hours after the initial explo-
sions, faint booms could still be
heard in the distance as clouds
of white smoke rose from the
area alongside hills in Maracay,
60 miles (100 kilometers) west of
Caracas.
"It's under control but there is
still risk," President Hugo Chavez
said as he visited firefighters and
other officials in Maracay.

He noted that the blasts hurled
some explosives such as grenades
long distances into surrounding
communities, and urged caution.
Officials were searching near-
by neighborhoods for any stray
explosives, Aragua state Gov.
Rafael Isea told the state-run
Venezuelan News Agency.
Chavez praised officials for
a swift response. "An event like
this could have produced ... a
much bigger tragedy," he said.
Chavez wondered aloud what
might have caused it, saying: "A
fire there is odd, and atthat hour."
Vice President Elias Jaua said
earlier on state television that
authorities were investigating -
and suggested they weren't rul-
ing out sabotage.
"We can't rule out any hypoth-
esis since Venezuela is a country
threatened by strong interna-
tional powers," Jaua said. "We
know of groups that act ina crazy
manner within our territory, but
it can't be determined yet if it was
provoked or if it was an accident."
He did not elaborate.

One woman in a house was
killed by a piece of shrapnel that
wounded her in the abdomen, the
Attorney General's Office said in
a statement.
Three people were injured in
traffic accidents amid the chaos
as people fled, Isea said.
"It seemed like they were
bombing us," said Yandry Rey, 30,
whose lives with her husband, a
military officer, and two children
in housing adjacent to the muni-
tions storage area.
She said the explosions shook
her house and woke her up, and
that they fled with their children.
Rey said she saw a "ball of fire"
when she opened the door.
Hours later, she and several
other people who fled the mili-
tary housing complex were rest-
ing on the edge of a ditch in the
shade. Rey's daughter still wore
her nightshirt.
Another woman, 27-year-old
Genesis Baricot, said her husband
returned to their house and saw
that the blasts had blown off their
front door and caused part of the

roof in the kitchen to collapse.
She said she didn't yet know
where the family would go.
"What are they going to do
with us?" she asked.
Soldiers and police blocked
exits on a major highway that
runs nearby.
Thousands of evacuees were
taken to a sports stadium, a mili-
tary barracks and a park, emer-
gency management director Luis
Diaz told state television.
Chavez said the evacuees
included Chinese and Russians
who were working on projects
in the area. He said the Russians
were building a rifle factory.
He did not elaborate on what
the Chinese were involved in.
National Guard Maj. Gen.
Luis Motta Dominguez said in
remarks broadcast by Union
Radio that authorities were wait-
ing for the smaller blasts to die
down and that what was left was
"a lot of smoke."
State TV showed firefight-
ers working to extinguish what
remained of the fire.

Somalian pirates
raided store, stole
freighter ship
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- Five Somali pirates captured
during a raid on a hijacked
cargo ship in the Arabian Sea
were brought yesterday to South
Korea, where they could face life
imprisonment, the coast guard
said.
The men were arrested as
South Korean commandos
raided the South Korean-oper-
ated Samho Jewelry earlier
this month, a week after pirates
seized the freighter and its 21
crew members. The commandos
rescued all crew members -
eight South Koreans, two Indo-
nesians and 11 Myanmar citizens

- and killed eight Somali pirates.
None of the crew members
was injured except for the South
Korean captain, who was shot
in the stomach by a pirate. The
captain, Seok Hae-gyun, was
brought to South Korea on Satur-
day night and had surgery for his
wounds.
Yesterday, the five suspect-
ed pirates arrived at Gimhae
airport in southeastern South
Korea and were placed in deten-
tion there.
Coast guard investigators
began questioning the Soma-
lis on charges they hijacked the
ship, requested a ransom and
attempted to kill the captain,
coast guard officer Hahm Un-sik
said. Under South Korean law,
the Somalis could be sentenced
to up to life in prison ifconvicted,
Hahm said.

Sanctuary to offer
more access to
general public
HOHENWALD, Tenn. (AP) -
Nestled on a secluded tract in the
wooded hills of rural Tennessee
is a sight that would likely startle
an outsider, if outsiders were
permitted to see it: the nation's
largest sanctuary for old, sick
and rescued elephants.
For the past 15 years, ele-
phants who had spent lifetimes
in zoos and circuses have found a
place to retire, rest and roam, far
from noisy audiences and free
from cramped quarters.
Now, after an unexpected
management change and a law-
suit filed by one of the original
founders last year, their place
of refuge is undergoing changes
that may allow the world a better
glimpse of their lives.
The sanctuary that's never

been open to the public now
wants to be a worldwide educa-
tional center for elephant care,
while still remaining true to its
mission to be a refuge for needy
elephants.
"The sanctuary is and has
always been about far more than
just the people who work in
it," said Rob Atkinson, the new
CEO who arrived in Tennes-
see late last year. "It's about the
elephants."
In 1995, two former elephant
trainers, Carol Buckleyand Scott
Blais, started the sanctuary near
Hohenwald, Tenn., about 85
miles southwest of Nashville, in
part because Tennessee's tem-
perate climate and vegetation
made it a good home for African
and Asian elephants.
With 2,700 acres of woodland
with a 25-acre lake, the sanctu-
ary has been home to 24 ele-
phants since it opened, including
several who were confiscated by
authorities.

Thousands of fish
dead in Erie and
St. Clair lakes
Officials say cold weather and
a fish virus likely are to blame for
thousands of dead gizzard shad
found recently in Lakes Erie and
St. Clair, the St. Clair River and
the Detroit River.
The Detroit Free Press and
The Detroit News report that the
weather and viral hemorrhagic
septicemia, or VHS, are suspect-
ed in the fish deaths. Researchers
from Michigan State University
and the University of Toledo took
samples of dead shad Thursday
and Friday that showed signs of
the fish virus.
Shad deaths are typical in the
winter. It's expected to take a
month to determine whether the
fish had VHS.
Although not dangerous for
humans, the virus has previously
caused large fish kills in Lakes
Ontario, Erie and Huron. It also
has turned up in Lake Michigan.

Nolan dies in N.Y.
Fashion designer Charles
Nolan, known to have a passion
for American classics but skew

personal touch, died yesterday at
age 53.
Nolan, who also was noted for
his political interest, had battled
cancer several years ago, and
it came back this past fall and
moved aggressively, said Mag-
gie Savage, the vintage buyer for
the Charles Nolan store in Man-
hattan's Meatpacking neighbor-
hood.
The store was open yeserday,
said Savage, who added that its
future was unclear but that she
hoped it would continue.
Women's Wear Daily, which
firstzreported Nolan's death on
its website, said he died of liver
cancer.
Nolan took a hiatus from the
fashion industry in 2003 and
worked on former Democratic
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean's
presidential campaign.

Mexican authorities say six

A Nuevo Leon state prosecu-

The spokeswoman said cartels
have been known to burn bod-

Residents return

About 600 people are return-

over nearby towns.
Hirokazu Taniyama, an offi-
cial in Miyazaki, said last Mon-
day that 612 people stayed in
elementary schools for the night
after volcanic activity increased
last Sunday. He said most of them
were returning home.
The explosive eruption at the
4,662-foot (1,421-meter) Shin-
moedake volcano Thursday was
its first major eruption in 52
years. Releases of ash and smoke
have continued since then.
Taniyama said nobody has
been injured in the eruptions.
The government has restricted
access to the mountain.

Aid continues amid
questions about the
nation's next leader
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) - The United States has no
plans to halt aid to earthquake-
ravaged Haiti in spite of a crisis
over who will be the nation's
next leader but does insist that
the president's chosen succes-
sor be dropped from the race,
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton said yesterday.
Clinton arrived yesterday in
the impoverished Caribbean
nation for a brief visit. She met
with President Rene Preval and
earlier met with each of the
three candidates jockeying to
replace him.
Only two candidates can go
on to the delayed second round,
now scheduled for March 20.
The U.S. is backing an Orga-
nization of American States
recommendation that the can-
didate from Preval's party, gov-
ernment construction official
Jude Celestin, should be left out
in favor of populist rival Miehel
Martelly.
The top U.S. official at the
United Nations, Susan Rice, said
recently that "sustained sup-
port" from the United States
required the OAS recommen-
dations be implemented. Many
Haitian officials, including lead-
ers of Preval's Unity party and
Martelly, interpreted that to
mean the U.S. was threatening
an embargo and cutting off aid.
Clinton flatly rebuffed that
suggestion. "We're not talking
about any of that," she said yes-
terday.
"We have a deep commit-
ment to the Haitian people,"
she told reporters. "That goes
to humanitarian aid, that goes

to governance and democracy
programs, that will be goingto a
cholera treatment center."
Asked if there were any set
of circumstances that would
prompt Washington to cut off
aid, Clinton said, "At this point,
no."'
Still, she insisted that the
United States would press the
recommendations by interna-
tional monitors after a disorga-
nized, fraud-ridden first-round
presidential vote in November.
They determined that Preval's
preferred successor, Celestin,
finished last and should drop
out. Celestin has yet to do so.
"We're focused on helping the
Haitian people," Clinton said
ahead of the meetings. "One of
the ways we want to help them
is by making sure that their
political choices are respected."
Haiti is in a deepening and
potentially destabilizing politi-
cal crisis. The announcement
of preliminary results from the
disputed first round led to riot-
ing in December. Final results
are expected to be announced
Wednesday.
Just five days after, on Feb. 7,
comes the constitutional end of
Preval's five-year term.
A law passed by an expiring
Senate last May would allow
him to remain in power for an
extra three months, but it is not
clear if his government would
continue to be recognized by
donor countries. But Preval has
said he does not want to hand
power to an interim govern-
ment.
"That's one of the problems
we have to talk about," Clin-
ton said. "There are issues of a
continuing government, how
that can be structured. And
that's what I'm going to be
discussing."w
Leaders of Preval's party said

last week that they would agree
with Celestin stepping down,
but the candidate has not com-
mented since and his lawyers
continue to plead his case to the
electoral council.
It is not clear what Preval
himself thinks.
Yesterday afternoon, each of
the bickering presidential can-
didates arrived by SUV at the
black metal gates of the U.S.
ambassador's sprawling resi-
dence for individual meetings
with Clinton.
Martelly came and went first.
Mirlande Manigat, the former
first lady who led the polling,
met with Clinton second.
Celestin's meeting came last.
Only Manigat stopped to talk
to a small gaggle of mostly for-
eign reporters waiting atcthe gate.
"You don't get the sense that
the United States wants the
election to be canceled but you
can feel that they would like
there to be stability," the law
professor said. "(Clinton) asked
me what conditions I could find
to make these elections more
acceptable. I said a climate of
calm ... (and) that they would
make some changes in the elec-
toral council."
Acknowledging the tight time
frame for Haiti, Clinton said she
wanted to hear ideas on how Hai-
ti's transition should be handled
but then make her own assess-
ment on the best way forward.
The political crisis comes
as the Western Hemisphere's
poorest nation tries to restart
its economy after decades of
stifling poverty and unemploy-
ment, and the massive loss of
life and infrastructure in last
year's earthquake.
Hundreds of thousands of
people remain in homeless
camps and rpajor rebuilding has
not started.

Columbia University
students ask for
rehab instead of
prison sentence
NEW YORK (AP)- They were
students who juggled an elite edu-
cation with criminal extracur-
riculars, dealing an array of drugs
from Ivy League dorm rooms and
frat houses, prosecutors say.
But beneath the surface of
academic success, some of the
Columbia University students
charged in a campus drug take-
down struggled with substance
abuse, their lawyers say.
Attorneys for two of the five
studentsplan to ask a court to pre-
scribe treatmentinstead of prison
- one of the most high-profile
tests so far of a recent overhaul
of New York's once-notoriously
stringent druglaws.
The outcome will be watched
closely by opponents and propo-

nents of2009 changes to mitigate
what were known as the Rock-
efeller drug laws. Backers called
the lesser punishments a more
effective and humane approach
to drug crime; critics said they
gave drug peddlers a pass.
With the bid for what's known
as' 'diversion"to treatment, the
Columbia bust "is probably the
case that's going to cause light to
be shed on what these new laws
mean: When diversion is appro-
priate, and what the Legislature
intended when it cut back so dras-
tically the Rockefeller laws," said
Marc Agnifilo, who represents one
ofthestudents, Christopher Coles.
Coles and fellow students
Harrison David, Adam Klein,
Jose Perez and Michael Wymbs
were arrested in December, have
pleaded not guilty and are due
back in court in March. Authori-
ties called the arrests one of the
largest drug takedowns at a New

ory, and the prestigious setting
made the case a media magnet.

15,000 Pakistani protesters
rally against American official

U.S. Embassy says
official detained
illegally by gov't
LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -
Hard-line Islamic leaders on
Sunday rallied at least 15,000
people against an American
official arrested in the shoot-
ing deaths of two Pakistanis
and warned the government
not to cave in to U.S. pressure to
release the man.
The protest in the eastern
city of Lahore, where the shoot-
ings took place, came as the U.S.
Embassy once again insisted
that the American has diplo-
matic immunity and was being
detained illegally by Pakistan.
But Pakistan has refused to
budge, saying the matter must
be decided by the courts.
The spat has revealed the
fragility of a relationship Wash-
ington believes is crucial for
success in Afghanistan and
against al-Qaida. Large protests
by hard-line Islamic groups,
which have significant influ-
ence in Pakistan, could make it
even more difficult for the gov-
ernment to free the American.
"We warn the government
and administration that ... if
they help the arrested Ameri-

can illegally, then this crowd
will surround the U.S. Embas-
sy and presidential palace in
Islamabad," Hafiz Hussain
Ahmed, a senior official in the
Jamiat Ulema Islam party, said
during Sunday's rally.
The U.S. has said the Ameri-
can, who has not been named,
acted in self-defense when
he shot two armed men who
approached his car in Lahore
on Thursday.
But many questions have
been left unanswered, includ-
ing exactly what the American
did at the U.S. Embassy and
why he was carrying a gun. The
lack of clarity has fueled media
speculation he may have been a
CIA agent or security contrac-
tor, as well as questions over
whether he qualified for diplo-
matic immunity.
The embassy attempted to
provide a little more clarity in
a press release Sunday titled
"Facts About Diplomatic Immu-
nity." It said the man is a mem-
ber of the embassy's "technical
and administrative staff" and
thus enjoyed the same crimi-
nal immunity that all diplomats
have under the Vienna Conven-
tion on Diplomatic Relations.
But legal arguments are
unlikely to sway ordinary Paki-
stanis, many of whom dislike

the U.S. and distrust their gov-
ernment in its dealings with
Washington. This animosity is
especially pronounced among
hard-line Islamic groups, which
oppose the war in Afghanistan
and object to Pakistan's alliance
with the U.S. in fighting the
Taliban and al-Qaida.
Sunday's demonstration was
organized by Jamaat-ud-Dawa,
which is widely believed to be
a front for the militant group
that attacked the Indian city
of Mumbai in 2008 and killed
166 people. The rally was origi-
nally called to protest changes
to Pakistani laws that mandate
the death penalty for insulting
Islam. But many of the speakers
used the opportunity to stoke
anger over the recent shoot-
ings.
"An American scoundrel has
killed two innocent youths in
the streets of Lahore," said the
leader of Jamiat Ulema Islam,
Maulana Fazlur Rahman. "It
should be decided in the courts
and any decision beyond the
courts will not be acceptable to
us. There should be an end to
American hegemony in Paki-
stan."
Lahore police chief Aslam
Tareen said there were between
15,000 and 20,000 people at the
rally in the center of the city.

Detroit vs. the suburbs
City and neighbors must co-manage water system
Due to a recent decision made by Oakland County and neigh-
boring suburbs, the city of Detroit may be hung out to dry.
Last Wednesday, Oakland County made a federal request to
implement a new oversight structure for the Detroit Water and Sewer-
age Department. The department has recently come under heavy scru-
tiny from state and national leaders due to its history of corruption and
mismanagement. Though the department has been mismanaged, the
city of Detroit should remain in control of the department. Detroit and
its suburbs must agree to share oversight of the department in order to
ensure an equal share of authority and financial liability.

Life is full of evaluations

Early last week, Detroit Mayor Dave Bing
met with regional leaders about the status of
the city's Water and Sewerage Department,
according to a Jan. 27 Detroit News article.
The meeting took place after Oakland County
filed a federal lawsuit calling for a new over-
sight board for the department. The Detroit
Water Department has been criticized for its
lack of oversight and longstanding corrup-
tion. Control over the department has come
into question after it played a central role in
former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's
racketeering conspiracy indictment. Oakland
County's proposed board would replace the
current oversight committee that's composed
of seven members, who are appointed by the
mayor, with a five member board including
Detroit's mayor and representatives from dif-
ferent counties in Southeast Michigan.
The Detroit Water Department has been
mismanaged under former oversight commit-_
tees, so the concerns being voiced by groups
from the suburbs aren't completely unfound'
ed. The city of Detroit controls ulti mil-
lion-dollar department that supplies water
to nearly all Southeastern Michigan. Any
problems with the department affect a wide
range of people, and Detroit leaders need to
acknowledge there are problems that need to
be addressed within the system.
While representatives from Oakland

County and other suburbs are correct in
recognizing that things must change at the
water department, taking away power from
Detroit isn't a viable plan. Detroit bears the
financial burden for the multi million-dollar
department, and the proposed change would
leave the city with that liability but give offi-
cials no authority over the functioning of the
system. The suburbs and the city of Detroit
must come to a compromise that holds the
department's leaders to a higher standard,
yet also allows Detroit to have a central role
in its operation.
The new water system should include input
from regional municipalities, but the current
state House bill being considered unfairly
allocates authority. Oakland County and other
suburbs that use Detroit's water need to have
an influence in the department's decisions,but
House Bill 4112 lets too much power rest in the
hands of the suburbs. A compromise on this
issue is in the best interest of the water depart-
ment, And it will foster a spirit of cooperation
between the different suburbs and the city of
Detroit.
There is progress to be made in the infra-
structure of Detroit, but stripping city officials
of authority in that decision isn't the way to
go about it. Detroit needs to work its way back
to being a hub city in Michigan, and regional
cooperation will help make that happen.

or eminently understand-
able reasons, arguments and
proposals about undergradu-
ate course selec-
tion, grading
and other related
issues tend to
dominate this
editorial page
(e.g. Viewpoint:
Abolish letter
grading, 12/5/10;
Viewpoint: Test NEILL
our GSI's before MOHAMMAD
they test us,
12/12/10; Jeff
Wojcik: Not enough course guidance,
1/4/11; Eric Szkarlat: Attendance
(not) mandatory, 1/19/11; Jeff Wojcik:
Test drive your class 1/17/11).
I can certainly see the value in
wantingto improve and refine under-
graduate instruction at the Universi-
ty. It's an important topic now more
than ever. The Chronicle of Higher
Education cited a recent study that
found only six of 10 American under-
graduates will see their performance
on a standardized skills test - the
Collegiate Learning Assessment -
improve over the course of a four-
year bachelor's degree. If there are
recurring and unnecessary barriers
to student achievement at the Uni-
versity, then we certainly ought to be
addressing them.
That said, it's difficult not to read
a disingenuous subtext into - just
to piekone example - Jeff Wojcik's
proposal for "the incorporation
of Michigan Student Assembly's
Advice Online right into the course
guide, so you can make informed
choices about how helpful and dif-
ficult your professors might be."
The implication, presumably, is that
simply knowing the course subject,
its content and the various factors
that will go into the grading process

for a course aren't enough to make
a decision. That's all covered by the
syllabus you're handed on the first
day of class. The risk, if I under-
stand this implication correctly, is
getting stuck with a GSI or profes-
sor who will give you a lower grade
- ignoringyour work ethic and your
aptitude - than someone else. And,.
of course, you're here to get good
grades, if not for your own sake,
then for your parents' or your future
employers'.
Here's where I should make a con-
fession: I've written three different
drafts of this column. The first time,
I drew on my teaching experience
at the University to write a column
fitting a company man to the bitter
end. I said that grades are assigned
anonymously whenever possible,
departments make every effort to
ensure consistency across sections
and between semesters, GSI's make
every effort to address serious grade
complaints or grievances, and so on
and so on.
The second time through, I wrote
it satirically: Since course evalua-
tions are themselves a type of grade
- a grade that you give to your pro-
fessor or GSI, which will go into
their "permanent record" and are
typically requested when apply-
ing for academic positions - what
recourse do they have? If you're will-
ing to believe that there are instruc-
tors who give their students unfair
grades, don't we have to also account
for students who give their ivustruc-
tors unfair evaluations? I would love
to know what particular kind of hell
would be unleashed if instructors
got to consult a similar rating scale
and admit students to their courses
and discussion section accordingly.
In the end,:I settled on a different
track and my point is this: Shopping
for an instructor who you think is

going to give you a better grade -
for reasons that are completely dis-
tinct fromyour effort and talent - is
self-defeating. Not because the set of
assumptions you make in doing so
are implausible on their face - even
though they are - but because it
ignores a basic fact of life: "Grades"
don't end with college. Someone is
going to be evaluating you and your
work, in some fashion or another,
for the rest of your life, and you will
rarely, if ever, get to pick who those
people are. Thinking that the key to
your academic record rests in pick-
ing the easy courses and instructors
over the "hard" ones fosters an illu-
sion of control over your life that is
never going to stand up under any
other conceivable set of circum-
stances after leaving the University.
Shopping for an
instructor is
self-defeating.
You might leave Ann Arbor and
end up working for a boss you don't
like. You might get an unwarranted
negative performance review that
leads to a missed promotion. You,
might open your own business, only
to have a few unreasonable custom-
ers poison its reputatio -Simething
will happen, inevitably, and there
won't be any opportunity to appeal:
No department chair, no dean of stu-
dents.
You might even go into teaching
and get an unfair course evaluation.
Wouldn't that be something?

Students aren't receptive to
department accommodations
TO THE DAILY:
The Daily's article about class enrollment
(Students Struggle to Enroll in 'U' Courses,
01/27/2011) contained a rather whopping
misrepresentation about alleged enrollment
problems in my department - Communica-
tion Studies. Because we're a very popular
concentration, students do sometimes have
trouble getting into our classes. But just before
the start of this term, we saw that we were
facing enormous enrollment pressures, so
the department added several sections to our
more over-subscribed classes, an additional
seminar and numerous faculty added extra
seats to their upper-level seminars for a total
of more than 150 additional spots.
Yet, as evidence of our alleged unrespon-
siveness to student needs, you cited an LSA
student, who claimed to have had "major
issues" trying to enroll in our courses. While
she said she got into COMM 101 and 102 "by

luck" - an enrollment procedure with which
I am unfamiliar - she had "no chance" of get-
ting into COMM 211. In fact, the student was
notified that two additional sections had been
created specifically forthis class, bothofwhich
fit with her schedule. They were, however, on
Thursday evening and Friday morning, times
that I realize can interfere with preparation
for, or recovery from, a night out at Rick's. The
student chose not to enroll in either of these
sections, so it's indeed wise that she "wouldn't
file a complaint." She did volunteer, however,
that she "would consider giving the comm
department some constructive criticism." As
a chair who watches approximately 15 faculty
handle nearly 1,500 students a term, all I can
say is "looking forward."
Of course it's very frustrating when stu-
dents cannotgetinto classes they want or need.
Our department actually cares about this and
to allege that we shut students out when just
the opposite occurred is to do an injustice to a
very hard-working faculty and staff.

an inviting atmosphere on campus

From Page 1A
Christon said her most memo-
rable experiences at the Univer-
sity have been witnessing cadets
swearing to support and defend
the Constitution at graduation.
She said her second-most memo-
rable moment was witnessing
cadets paint a message for her on
The Rock on the corner of Hill
Street and Washtenaw Avenue.
"For them to care enough to
do that - that was the greatest
gift ever ... thousands of people
don't get that opportunity to
get their name on the rock," she
said.
Christon also discussed how
she enjoyed counseling the
cadets as they prepare to enter
the Air Force after graduation.
"It's been a privilege to be
there for them, to help guide
them and help them understand
what the Air Force expects of
them."
Engineering senior Brad Oat-
men, a cadet in the AFROTC,
said that Christon has been a
driving force and mentor for all
students in the program.
"She keeps us in check
because she knows what's actu-
ally going to happen out there,"
Oatmen said. "She's kind of the
eyes and ears of experience that
we don't have."
The close-knit nature of the
University's AFROTC helped
Christon feel at home on cam-
pus.

"People are actually standing
up for their rights," Mattar said.
According to Mattar, the cri-
sis in Egypt is mainly the result
of frustration among young peo-
ple who are unable to find jobs in
the country's poor economy.
Mattar added he believes the
protests in Egypt will lead to
more citizen-led political reform
movements across the Middle
East.
"It's already having a ripple
effect," Mattar said. "But we
don't know what the outcome
in different countries is going to
be."

Mattar added he was encour-
aged by the number of people
who attended the event on Fri-
day.
"The number of people
around here is just shocking to
me," Mattar said.
Mohamed El-Sayed, an asso-
ciate professor in the College of
Engineering, led the group of
protesters in an Arabic chant.
El-Sayed said the chant trans-
lated into English as, "Down
for Mubarak's regime, long live
Egypt."
El-Sayed added that he
believes the crisis in Egypt
is representative of a lack of
democracy and acorruptregime.
"(Mubarak) has been in power
for 30 years," El-Sayed said.
"There is no democracy that
allows somebody to rule for 30

years."
Like Mattar, El-Sayed said he
was impressed with the turnout
and clear student interest in the
issue.
"It just shows that (students)
are fully aware of what's going
on," El-Sayed said.
LSA senior Noha Moustafa
also commended the turnout at
the protest, calling it "a testa-
ment to the student activism
that is on this campus."
Moustafa, another member of
the Egyptian Students Associa-
tion, said she supports the Egyp-
tian citizens who have decided to
expresstheir pent-up frustration
with Mubarak's administration.
"I'm glad that the people are
finally able to do something
about the oppressive regime,"
Moustafa said.

Capt. Jonathan Liscombe, an
assistant professor at the Uni-
versity's AFROTC who worked
with Christon for the past year
and half, said he'll miss working
with her.
"She's one of those rare
employees that will lift everyone
up, no matter what is going on
in the day," Liscombe said. "She
always has a smile on her face,
so it naturally puts a smile on
mine."
Liscombe continued, "From
day one she introduced herself to
me as Sgt. Christon, and she gave
me a big hug. That's very rare,
especially in the military where
it's really formal."
LSA senior Thomas Barger,
an AFROTC cadet, said Christon

helped him feel comfortable in
the program.
"She has such a personality
about her," Barger said. "It's not
just that she's a hard worker ...

approachable, and she's always
joking with people, always
laughing, always kind of teasing
you a little bit, but always with
something positive to say."
Though Christon said she's
looking forward to the next
chapter in her life, she'll miss
being at the University.
"I never even knew anything
about football before being here
at Michigan," she said. "(Now)
I've become a Wolverine to my
heart ... It's just the camaraderie
here at Michigan - it's conta-
gious."

Lanza said.
Rachford, who was not
a student at the University,
graduated from Ann Arbor's
Community High School in2009
and was a member of the div-
ing team at Ann Arbor's Pioneer
High School.
LSA sophomore Patton
Doyle, who was on Pioneer High
School's swim team with Rach-
ford, said Saturday evening Rach-
ford was a very valuable member
of the team.
"He was a great guy," Doyle
said. "This is a horrible thingthat
happened."
The second person found
unconscious - a non-University
student named Tyne Mosbey-
is in critical condition at Butter-
worth Hospital in Grand Rapids,

hospital officials confirmed late
last night.
Lanza said authorities are not
sure whether the residence met
fire safety standards or if it had
workingsmoke detectors.
"It's hard to say right now," he
said Saturday.
Lanza said Saturday evening
the fire department is waiting
to find out specific details of the
incident. AAFD did not return
multiple calls by The Michigan
Daily as of Sunday evening.
The department will most
likely release results of the inves-
tigation Monday, Lanza said on
Saturday.
Lanza also said he believes
the fire spread as much as it did
because of the time it originated.
"At that hour of the morning,
I'm sure everybody was asleep, so
it probably went unnoticed for a
while," he said.
One neighbor who lives near

the house, who wished to remain
anonymous, said she had seen
people entering and exiting
Rachford's house on Saturday at
about 3 a.m. Another neighbor,
who also requested anonymity,
said he had also heard and seen
activity inside and around the
house atthattime.
Eight other neighbors inter-
viewed Sunday said they were
awoken by the sound of sirens at
about 5 a.m.
None of the neighbors who
commented said they had met the
individuals living in the house
that caught fire. A few neighbors
said Rachford, the unidentified
injured woman and two or three
other young adults moved into
the house this past fall.

Panhel talks women's leadership

At discussion, Dean
of Students urges
sorority leaders to
band together
ByKIMBERLY PAGEAU
About 200 executive board
members of the University's
Panhellenic Association sorori-
ties attended a seminar titled
"Women Leading Women" yes-
terday afternoon to discuss the
importance of women leadership.
Held at the Michigan League
Ballroom, the event was exclu-
sively for sorority executive board
members. In addition to discuss-
ing women's leadership, par-
ticipants focused on teamwork.
Laura Blake Jones, the Univer-
sity's dean of students, spoke to
the group about obstacles women
leaders face today and how
women can overcome them.
Following Jones's speech, the
panel broke up into various ses-
sions for each executive position.
LSA junior Sarah Smith, Panhel's
vice president of public relations
and a Michigan Daily columnist,
said though some women have
different official titles, they often
perform the same duties in the
chapters.
"The event is a chance for
sorority leaders to meet and col-
laborate with each other on issues
that all these chapters are facing,"
Smith said.
Mary Beth Seiler, director of
University Greek Life, said in an
interview at the event that Panhel
holds a Women Leading Women
event every year.
This year's event was different
CONFERENCE
From Page 1A
cussion about Japan, the Associa-
tion of Southeast Asian Nations,
China, Korea and India. It also
held panels about technology, cor-
porate social responsibility and
energy and the environment.
Business graduate student
Carrington Renfield-Miller, the
conference co-chair, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the confer-
ence drew 217 people, including
students, alumni and area profes-
sionals. The event was sponsored
by the Ross School of Business's
Student Government Association,
the school's Center for Interna-
tional Business Education and the
University's Center for Chinese
Studies and the University's Cen-
ter for Japanese Studies among
others.

than previous years', Seiler said,
because a group of experts from
the University and Ann Arbor
community came to speak dur-
ing the breakout sessions. One of
the experts, University Assistant
General Counsel Maya Kobersy,
spoke to the sorority presidents
aboutrisk management and liabil-
Sity issues. 5
Before the breakout sessions;
began, Jones emphasized how
women can benefit from working
together.
"The value and relationships
of sisterhood that this group so
clearly espouses and embodies
has been a big part of my success,"
she said.
Following the event, Jones said
she hopes her own professional
experiences can inspire women.
"As a woman who has worked
in leadership roles for a long time,
it's rewarding to be able to give
back and encourage others to
think about all the possibilities
that are offered to them."
Jones said throughout her
career, she'sworked hard to prove
she's more than just compassion-
ate and empathetic - traits she
said were stereotypically associ-
ated with women in the work-
place. However, she added that
women need to find a balance
between being too nurturing and
too stoic.
"Some of the things that I put
in my speech have rung true in my
career," Jones said. "I've seen col-
leagues of mine who are women
who went so far to avoid that ste-
reotype that they've come across
... as not feeling and uncaring."
Still, in her speech, Jones said
it is often hard for women to stray
from what is traditionally expect-
ed of them.
"There's still powerful scripts

that exist in our society (in terms
of) stereotypes for women," Jones
said. "Deviating from what's still
considered to be the norm for
women can be costly."
Over the course of her time
in the workplace, Jones told the
attendees that women have come
a long way in terms of employ-
ent opportunities.
"You know that your future
has always included the oppor-
tunity to be mothers, daughters,
sisters and friends," Jones said
"Your Michigan experience and
today's opportunities that exist
for women also means you can be
doctors,lawyers, teachers, college
presidents, corporate executives,
the Speaker of the House (and)
state senators."
The University community
contains prime examples of
women leaders, Jones said. She
specifically mentioned University
President Mary Sue Coleman and
E. Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for Student
Affairs, as inspirational women.
"(Coleman) embodies the fact
that more and more women are
in executive positions on college
university campuses across the
country," Jones said.
Though women have made tre-
mendous strides in recent years,
they are still subject to certain
stigmas and prejudices, Jones
said. To overcome these challeng-
es, she said she believes women of
this generation need to continue
to capitalize on the bonds and
foundations that were built by
previous generations of women.
"As women we do need to be
champions and supporters of each
other," she said.

Ghanta spoke before the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents meet-
ing on Jan.20 asking for financial
support for the conference. Ghan-
ta wrote in an e-mail interview
last night that they didn't receive
any funding for the event from the
regents.
In an interview after speaking
on a panel about China, Marty
Kahn, CEO of the Ann Arbor-
based business ProQuest, said the
University's longstanding com-
mitment to the conference reflects
its presence on the global stage.
"It's really startling how inter-
national the University of Michi-
gan is," Kahn said.
Kahn, whose company sells
databases in China, added that it's
important for students to "recog-
nize that the global economy is
not just a flow of goods, but the
flow of ideas."
Venkatesh Prasad, a group

and senior technical leader for
Ford Motor Co., spoke during
the technology panel. He said in
an interview at the event that he
is pleased with the opportunities
the conference offers for Univer-
sity students.
"I think this is a really rich
experience for those students
(and) for those who come as pan-
elists," Prasad said. "The past
meets the present to create the
future."
Business graduate student MJ
Kamal, said in an interview at the
conference that he enjoyed the
event and its broad appeal.
"It's a nice break from every-
thing else," Kamal said. "It's very
good for students who are not in
the Business School."

EGYPT
From Page 1A
in Alexandria had not registered
with the University's newly-
revamped travel registry, Fitzger-
ald said: Two of the students
studying in Alexandria were out
of the country when the violence
started last week. The two other
students will leave Egypt today
and fly to Dubai on a charter flight,
according to Fitzgerald.
The University found out the
students were in Alexandria

because University officials called
several study abroad programs in
Egypt and throughout the Middle
East, Fitzgerald said, to ensure all
University students were safe.
Fitzgerald said it's feasible, but
"highly unlikely" there are still
University students in Egypt who
University officials don't know
about.
"It's always possible that a stu-
dent could've taken a semester off
from classes and not be registered
and we wouldn't know exactly
where they might be," he said.
Fitzgerald said University offi-

cials, like John Godfrey, assistant
dean for International Education
at Rackham, have been in touch
with the students either directly
or indirectly to ensure they were
out of harm's way.
"(Administrators) involved
with international study abroad
programs have been working
around the clock to make sure
where our students are, to know
that they're safe, to be in contact
with their families and to partici-
pate in making the arrangements
for them to come back to the Unit-
ed States," Fitzgerald said.

He added that Godfrey has also
been discussing with other Uni-
versity officials the possibility of
the students coming back to the
U.S. and enrolling at the Univer-
sity this semester.
A group of two University grad-
uate students, a faculty member
and a staff member are also con-
ducting research in the south of
Egypt, Fitzgerald said. The group
has been in contact with Univer-
sity officials, but since they are
about 300 miles south of Cairo, it
was determined they could stay.
For the third straight day yes-

terday, protesters in Cairo defied
a government-mandated 4 p.m.
curfew. At least 10,000 protest-
ers congregated in Tahrir Square
in downtown Cairo. Nobel Peace
laureate Mohamed ElBaradei is
leading the mass uprising that
was sparked suddenly last week
by social media sites like Twitter
and Facebook. ElBaradei spoke to
the assembled crowd shortly after
night fell on the Egyptian capital
last night calling for a democratic
political process.
The military, with tanks and
other armed vehicles, as well as

police, were stationed through-
out Cairo yesterday. Police were
increasing their presence in the
streets as part of an effort to end
looting and lawlessness that has
become rampant.
The U.S. Embassy suggested
Americans leave Egypt as soon as
they could and said it would begin
organizing flights out of the coun-
try today. Non-emergency embas-
sy employees and employee family
members are also allowed to leave.

Drowning in waves of

COURTESY OF THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY
"This worked with McAdams, goddamnit!"
A vapid'Vqalentine'

Well crafted film
tells stale story of
love gone wrong
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Arts Writer
it's that most familiar-seem-
ing of domestic dramas: the story
of a broken marriage unspooling
into crisis
before our
eyes. It boasts
two excel- Blue Valentine
lent perfor-
mances from At the State
two attrac- The Weinstein
tive people Companys
paid to give
excellent per-
formances. It crosscuts between
the couple's early courtship
and present-day derailment;
meanwhile, we're treated to an
adorable but personality-free
toddler, a vengeful ex-boyfriend
and several raw, nonerotic sex-
ual encounters (not even close
to NC-17 material unless your
blood curdles at the sight of a
man giving his wife 10-15 sec-
onds of otal pleasure).
In short, "Blue Valentine" is
exactly what it wants to be: an
ultra-low-budget cautionary tale
about the follies of love, a film
imminently disposable by its
very nature, with a shelf life only
as long as the gap until the next
prestige picture about a marital
struggle. It will prove illuminat-
ing for some viewers and unre-
markable for others; it will be no
one's favorite movie.
Yet the film boasts a note-

worthy visual style - the low
budget having freed writer-
director Derek Cianfrance
("Brother Tied") and cinema-
tographer Andrij Parekh ("It's
Kind of a Funny Story") to make
refreshing, effective choices.
Even when Dean (Ryan Gos-
ling, "Half Nelson") and Cindy
(the Oscar-nominated Michelle
Williams, "Brokeback Moun-
tain") occupy the same physi-
cal space, they rarely share the
same frame; we'll see soft-lens
close-ups of the sides of their
faces, one at a time in the blue-
tinged light of a love motel's
"future room," heightening the
sense of divide between the
two. When the film falls back
on digital video shaky-cam only
two scenes later, it's akin to a
concert where the singer fol-
lows up a rollicking new track
with his cheesy, overplayed hit
from the '90s.
The couple's two halves, Dean
and Cindy, merit our sympathy,
though not in equal measure.
We root for them throughout the
first two acts of the film on the
strength of their performances.
In the flashbacks, we see Cindy
driven to attend medical school,
while high school dropout Dean,
a lifter for a moving company
who meets her purely by chance,
is driven only to be with her. He
serenades her with a perfor-
mance of "You Always Hurt the
One You Love" that probably fits
the movie's theme a little too
closely, but nevertheless pos-
sesses mysterious heart-warm-
ing power.
Dean's certainly a hand-
ful, though. One could make

a strong argument that by the
end, he is much more at fault for
the couple's destruction than
Cindy. Consider: Dean is overly
emotional, childlike and brash
in his actions, selfish in the way
he drags Cindy to a sleazy love
motel the night before she's on
call because he can't get over the
death of their dog. Throughout
all of this, Cindy's chief crime
seems to be her inability to com-
municate her emotions prop-
erly - a problem to be sure, but
it doesn't manifest itself as a
breaking point the way Dean's
actions do.
It's difficult to say whether
this uneven distribution of flaws
was the Cianfrance's intention,
but it comes off as sloppy char-
acterization on his part. After
all, why root for Dean and Cindy
to work out their issues when we
agree with Dean's self-patroniz-
ing admission that he's not good
enough for her?
There is some material in
the script that holds promise -
mainly Cindy's conversations
with her frail grandmother,
which hints at the dark under-
current of loveless relationships
through America's generations.
But by the third act, when the
naturalistic, bubbling tension
between Dean and Cindy boils
over into soap-opera histrionics,
we no longer have that tie to a
larger thematic message. There
are only two ways this story can
end now: sadly or ambiguously.
And neither option will distin-
guish "Blue Valentine" from the
venerable domestic-struggle
stable of squids, whales and rev-
olutionary roads.

ver winter break, I was
making my list of the top
five television shows of
2010 for the Daily when it hit me
- there's an obnoxious amountof
quality tele-
vision cur-
rently on air.
Obnoxious
in the sense
that it drives r
me bonkers to
think about
how many
excellent KAVI
shows I need PANDEY
to regularly
watch, both
as a TV columnist and a devotee
of the medium, all while balanc-
ing studies, work and this thing
called a social life.
As I perused my final tally -
"Justified," "Parks & Recreation,"
"Boardwalk Empire," "HowI
Met Your Mother" and "Terriers"
- I was appalled by the number
of awesome shows I had left off.
There was the unrelentingly
clever "30 Rock," the endlessly
genius "Community," the slight-
ly-disappointing-but-still-great
"Lost," the understated "How to
Make It in America" and the rest
of HBO's programming arsenal,
among a bevy of others.
And those are just some of the
shows I regularly keep up with
- I'm always one season behind
on AMC's acclaimed alliterative
duo of "Mad Men" and "Break-
ing Bad" and have yet to sample
loads of other critically beloved
shows, like "Fringe," "The Good
Wife" and "Doctor Who." Late-
night TV-wise, it's a total clus-
tercuss - I sob at the number
of ?uestlove's epic "Remix the
Clips" I've missed on "Late Night
with Jimmy Fallon" because
I was watching the repeatof
Conan interviewing Donald
Glover or some other jabroni,
which I missed at its regular
time because I was watching Jon
Stewart eviscerate Glenn Beck
on "The Daily Show."
But the party don't stop
there, no. Whoah-ooh oh oh oh
oh. More intriguingshows are
constantly premiering on all
networks, like "Lights Out" on
FX, "Episodes" on Showtime and
"The Chicago Code" on FOX.

they're the
middle-aged Quality Hill
and slightly
pretentious Chill Out Men. Too
old for pop punk and too cool
to concede to straightforward
dad rock, the Kansas quintet
has traded in its three-chord
progressions and shamelessly
singable choruses about long
distance relationships for more
textured and often experimen-
tal arrangements whose subject
matter tends to be as abstract as
the songs themselves.
Coming seven years after the
band's last full-length release,
Rules has inevitably been tagged
with the dubious label of being
a "comeback album." However,
after listening to the heav-
ily distorted voiceover intro-
duction and disorderly guitar
tones of opener "Tithe," it's clear
the Get Up Kids no longer feel
comfortable treading old musi-
cal ground. Instead, they forge
ahead with warped, contorted
instrumentation and cryptic
messages, marking a strange
departure from their conta-
giously accessible past material.
The subtle pulse and pitter-
pattering of "Rally 'Round The
Fool" provides the best example
of the band's exploration of more

innovative sounds and song
structures. An ominous feel is
established with a barely con-
scious bassline, followed by the
howling high notes of a synthe-
sizer and a decidedly unemo-

Good. Now let's see the white swan.
Despite how modernized and
drenched in special effects "The
Mechanic" becomes, you can
tell the story itself was taken
from the '70s. That is, there is no
clear hero, no person we're sup-
posed to relate to or sympathize
with and no one, in the end, who
we can point to and call "good."
This action movie is fun, but it's
also dark. It presents a world in
which ridiculous, murderous
stunts go off without a hitch
and there seem to be too many
thugs, criminals and hitmen
to possibly live with any peace
of mind. Above all, it depicts a
world in which there is no jus-
tice save for what is rogue, cold-
blooded and ruthless.

Perhaps the silence inherent
to this film is not something
we're supposed to get used to.
Perhaps the fact that Statham
understands the merciless-
ness of this world is the reason
he has so little to say about it.
Maybe we're not meant to draw
any conclusion from this film
apart from the fact that the
world is terrible, and the sooner
we pack heat against it the safer
we become.
Stoic Statham makes himself
seem like the man to ask about
the justice, discipline and what
desolate fate awaits us all. But,
in "The Mechanic," he makes
it clear that he doesn't want to
talk about it.

By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
There are many paradoxical
problems in this world, like the
chicken-or-egg debacle. But the
one we are concerned with at the
moment is this: Does music influ-
ence fashion, or does fashion influ-
ence music?
Fashion has always made a big
statement in the music world. The
style of music a band plays often
determines what its members will
wear while performing. Imag-
ine The Ramones with perfectly'
slicked-back hair sportingsuits and
ties while rocking out on stage, or
Jimi Hendrix not in a silk robe with
wild hair sprouting from a bandana.
It just wouldn't compute.
Style is a significant component
of what a band sounds like. As we
live ina visual media-driven world,
appearance is everything. Now,
before you criticize my materialis-
tic approach to music, please con-
sider the fact that music probably
wouldn't be as cool if it didn't look
cool. For example, contemplate
the punk era - those rock stars
wouldn't seem as legitimate with-
out torn-up cigarette jeans and
messy bed-head hair paired with a
plaid flannel peeking out of a black,
leather, studded motorcycle jacket.
Looking badass is half the battle.
The style of songs a band or
musician plays on stage determines
their presence on stage, and with
that comes their wardrobe. Still
not convinced? Think about a more
modern, less era-driven band like
Vampire Weekend.*The Upper East
Side preppsters wouldn't be half as
fun without their Burberry button-
downs, blazers and Ralph Lau-
ren khakis. Their style makes the
band's sound, and the sound makes
the style. There is no chance in hell
I could take their profoundly intel-
ligent lyrics seriously without an
educated flair in their apparel.

However, some may argue that
bands with a conformed style are
just products of their record label.
Take '90s boy bands, for instance.
I'msurethe 20-something-year-old
boys of *NSYNC did not enjoy con-
forming and collaboratingtheir red
carpet-ready outfits just to make a
statement they were agroup. People
like individuality, and music is often
about individuality and uniqueness.
So in order to express their creativ-
ity further, musicians often create
their own styles.
She & Him is one of my favorite
bands,and one ofmylifelongdreams
is to raid singer Zooey Deschanel's
closet. I love the romantic frills and
girly silhouettes of her style, and
you can bet that when I saw She &
Him live and noticed Zooey wear-
ing a blue; 1950's flare-out, lace and
tulle dress, I rummaged through
every vintage store I encountered to
find a dress just like hers (I failed).
Zooey's fashion sense' meshes well
with the type of music she produces
and a sort of presence is created.
And I, like others, want to emulate
that presence - with that presence
comes a liking to a certain style of
music.
But which one
came first?
It is obvious that there's an ele-
ment of fashion in music - why
else would we care who was wear-*
ing what to the Grammy Awards
or want to dive into a pile of plaid
pullovers and sweater vests after
every time we saw the Tommy Hil-
figer commercial featuring Vampire
Weekend's "Holiday?" There is a
correlation, and while there is still
no saying which inspireswhich, one
thingis for sure - in order to sound
the part, you have to look it too.

A wake-up
callfor Blue

DETROIT -
Awake-up call.
It's a clich6d
phrase that's used
all the time by collegiate and
professional athletes, but it's
one that hadn't been used by
any members of the Michigan
hockey team this season - at
least not
publicly.
But
following
the Wol-
verines'
2-1 loss to
Michigan
State on
Saturday, MARK
senior BURNS
Louie
Caporusso
described
Michigan's defeat as just
that. It might be surprising to
some, considering the Wol-
verines are one measly point
behind Notre Dame for first
place in the CCHA - they
even have two games in hand
to pick up some ground on
the Fighting Irish.

Maybe the conference
standings and Michigan's
recent five-game win streak
don't tell the entire story of a
team winninga few games it
has no right being in. Not to
mention, maybe the toughest
part of its schedule is still yet
to come-in the waning month
of the season.
"It's gut check time I
think," Caporusso said after
Saturday's loss. "I think we
were almost, a little, not
being true to ourselves. We
won games that maybe we
shouldn't have won, and
maybe we had this confidence
that maybe we shouldn't have
had. That can hurt you."
Two weeks ago, the Wol-
verines came back from a
two-goal deficit at Yost Ice
Arena against Ferris State.
Last weekend, they secured
a sweep of Alaska in which
senior netminder Shawn Hun-
wick earned a star-studded
performance, stopping 73-of-
76 shots in two home contests.

Novak, Ann Arbor's
newest folk hero

nn Arbor, it seems you
finally have your folk
sports hero.
Watching Thursday's game
- a season-
changing win
for Michigan
basketball on
the road at
the Breslin
Center - it
became strik-
ingly clear RYAN
that Zack KARTJE
Novak is dif-
ferent from
any other student-athlete at the
University of Michigan.
Novak has never been a
superstar athlete. But last year,
he spent most of the season
guarding guys that were at least
four or five inches taller than
him.
Novak has also never been
the Wolverines' scorer. This
season, he's averaging just a
tick under 10 points, trailing
both Darius Morris and Tim
Hardaway Jr. in total scoring.
But chances are, when it really
counts, the junior guard is the
one making the baskets.
Since Big Ten season began,
Novak has been on an absolute
tear - far and away the team's
best overall player. Against con-
ference opponents, the Ches-
terton, Indiana native has only
come up short of double-digit
scoring in one game - Michi-
gan's tough loss to Northwest-
ern in mid-January.
But as Michigan State began
charging back in the second half
on Thursday and coach John
Beilein called a timeout, Novak
stormed into the huddle and
emerged as the obvious leader
of this team. He screamed with
a passion I haven't seen out of
any Michigan player on the

court in some time.
And it worked.
His team came out and held
on to end the Wolverines' awful
winless streak against Michi-
gan State, thanks to a handful
of 3-point beauties from Novak
himself.
"We are a young team with a
lot of guys that are kind of naive
because they're young," Novak
said at Big Ten media day. "They
don't know that they're not
supposed to win some of these
games. They don't know that
they should lose to teams like
Kansas. So youth can help us."
Through more than half of
the season, I'd say youth has
helped the Wolverines in plenty
of games, one of them being
last Thursday in East Lansing.
Young players tend to rely on
hot streaks in big games and the
Wolverines just happened to be
boiling against the Spartans.
It was exactly how Novak had
predicted.
Novak, like the team around
him, didn't have much hype
surrounding his 2011 season.
Despite being one of the team's
veterans, fellow junior guard
Stu Douglass always seemed to
be billed as the better shooter,
better scorer, better ballhan-
dler. Novak was often relegated
to the grinder's role.
He was left out of the start-
ing lineup on more than one
occasion for a younger, high-
potential product of Beilein's
offense. But Novak continued to
push for playing time. Now, he's
an absolutely indispensable part
of the Michigan offense.
And that's the best part about
watching Novak play. He's a
player any Michigan fan could
get behind.
He's a ballhawk on the
boards. You'd never know he's

just a 6-foot-4 guard, especially
if you're looking at the stat
sheet, where Novak leads the
team in rebounds per game.
He's preparing to shatter the
Michigan record books when
it comes to 3-point shooting.
With another year remaining,
he's already a staple in the top
10 in Wolverine history, and if
he keeps shooting like he did
against the Spartans, he'll have
a comfortable lead at the top
when his career is done.
And Novak isn't not afraid to
get his hands dirty. Any guard
who's willing to go up against
the Big Ten's fiercest post play-
ers, deserves a certain respect
that most players will never
find. I bet if you gave Novak a
chance, he would've guarded
Ohio State's Jared Sullinger in a
heartbeat.
Novak is becoming the kind
of player you know you'll talk
about 20 years from now with
your buddies, sitting around the
garage and remembering that
huge 3-pointer he hit against
the Spartans in 2011.
Or the buzzer beater he made
in the first round of the 2011
NCAA Tournament (wishful
thinking?).
Regardless, Novak has
stamped himself as the leader of
this Michigan team - a squad
that desperately needed a blue-
collar, smooth-as-silk shooting,
ballhawking, clutch type of bas-
ketball player.
And with no expectations, no
star players and plenty of poten-
tial, Novak could carry the odd-
est Michigan basketball team
in history to somewhere no one
would've thought possible back
in November.

Senior forward Loule Caporusso has scored more goals at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit than in Yost Ice Arena this season.
Caporussoshines indefeat

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
DETROIT - Maybe Louie
Caporusso just needed to enter
the familiar confines of Joe
Louis Arena one last time.
The senior forward entered
Saturday's contest against Mich-
igan State riding one of the worst
stretches of his career - held
scoreless in the last month with
only a pair of goals since the
beginning of December.
But Caporusso was one of the
few bright spots for the No. 6
Michigan hockey team in a frus-
trating 2-1 loss to the Spartans,
scoring the Wolverines' lone
tally in the waning moments of
the second period.
Just 37 seconds after Michi-
gan State scored the first goal
of the game, Caporusso took
a feed from senior forward
Scooter Vaughan on the right
side of the Spartan net. Capo-
russo cut across the crease in
front of goalie Will Yanakeff,
shifted over the downed goal-
tender, and as he went airborne,
he tapped in the loose puck on
the right side of Yanakeff for his
eighth goal..
It was a finesse move display-
ing the type of goal-scoring flair
the Wolverines haven't seen
often from their alternate cap-
tain this season.
Considering his history at the
Joe - 18 points in 18 games - it

shouldn't have been surprising
for Caporusso to play hero and
knot the game at such an impor-
tant juncture. But the Cana-
dian's cold snap has rattled him
worse than the bone-chilling
Ann Arbor weather, and he was
just as relieved as the Michigan
fans in the audience.
"It felt great," Caporusso said
with a laugh. "It's tough. When
you're not scoring it becomes
impossible to score. But once you
get one you feel like a large load
is lifted off your shoulders. It felt
really good."
And it's not the first time he's
felt this way.
On the same date last year
(Jan. 29), Caporusso battled sim-
ilar odds. He had scored twice in
two months and had almost the
exact same statistics - six goals
and 13 assists last season versus
seven goals and 14 assists as a
senior. But Caporusso rebound-
ed to tally 26 points in the final
19 games to finish as the team's
top goal scorer.
Caporusso, a self-proclaimed
second-half performer, may
have shrugged the perennial
monkey off his back on Saturday,
but it was difficult for Michigan
coach Red Berenson to accept
the silver lining in the team's
first loss in six games.
"The bottom line is you lose
the game, it doesn't matter who
scores or who does well, the
team doesn't win, and that's the

important thing," Berenson said
on Saturday. "But I think some
players took a step forward and
some took a step backward."
One of the skaters noticeably
absent from the box score on
Saturday was senior forward
Carl Hagelin, whose scoreless
night ended a nine-game point
streak during which he added
19 points. But while Hagelin's
streak ended, so did Caporusso's
drought.
Though Hagelin carried
the Wolverines during the last
two months, it will be vital to
have both players contributing
regularly. In the final 19 games
of Michigan's NCAA regional
semifinals run last season, Hage-
lin and Caporusso combined for
48 points.
If history is any indicator, the
key to Michigan's success may
have just have needed a trip
down memory lane and up the
steps of Joe Louis Arena to find
his scoring touch. The second-
period goal was Caporusso's
second of the season at the Joe
- one more than he's scored in
a dozen appearances at Yost this
season.
"I love it here, I don't know
what it is, it's just my place,"
Caporusso said. "It's just a
dream come true. I've always
watched the Red Wings play
here, and I never thought I'd be
playing here this much and be
having so much success here."

Smotrycz takes step forward .
in decisive win over Hawkeyes

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer
Conference play hasn't
always been kind to Evan
Smotrycz.
The axiom goes that the true
test of a freshman's mettle is
how he responds during the
grind of the conference season
- especially in a league as deep
and physical as the Big Ten.
Smotrycz has seen it first-
hand. The freshman forward
has struggled at times for the
Michigan men's basketball team
in recent weeks. He failed to
score a single point in the Jan.
12 game against then-No. 2 Ohio
State and against No. 25 Michi-
gan State this past Thursday.
That just makes his perfor-
mance in the Wolverines' 87-73
victory over Iowa (1-8 Big Ten,
8-13 overall) on Sunday all the
more impressive. Smotrycz
played just 19 minutes against
the Hawkeyes but still man-
aged to score 14 points, shooting
5-of-6 from the field, including
4-of-5 from 3-point range.
When sophomore point
guard Darius Morris penetrat-
ed the lane in one of his many
drives to the basket, Smotrycz
was waiting on the wing and
ready to knock down shots. He
said afterwards that a game like
the one he had is big for his con-
fidence.
"I'm pretty comfortable
(during conference games),"
Smotrycz said. "It's just, as a
shooter, you can't let dry spells
affect you. I kind of try to have
some amnesia and just shoot it,
knock them down when they're
open.
"It's tough (to rebound from
bad performances) but I think a

But Michigan - and
Smotrycz in particular - was
able to shoot over the Hawk-
eyes. And the 6-foot-9 forward
displayed some versatility that
he has rarely shown this sea-
son. His lone 2-point basket
came from a Morris-like drive
through the paint, punctuated
by a nifty layup. The shot put
Michigan up 45-25 and forced
Iowa totake a timeout.
"It was cool to see him do
that, because we make fun
of him for being just a shoot-
er," sophomore walk-on Josh
Bartlestein said. "For him to
do that, and to see the ball han-

ers.
"You certainly can see that
that happens quite often," Bei-
ein said. "And it depends on
who we're playing sometimes
as well, but Evan has really
worked hard in practice. Some-
times it's a matchup, sometimes
it's the defense - there's alot of
things that he's learning about
- but he's learning every day."
But because the Wolverines
often live and die bythe 3-point-
er - and because Smotrycz is
a starter and a player heavily
relied upon to make perimeter
shots - it's critical for Michigan
to get more "ups" than "downs"
from him.

Matt Rust, it looked as if
something was finally going
to give. While the Wolver-
ines fired three shots on that
power play, they couldn't find
a way past Spartan netmind-
er Will Yanakeff.
It took just over 39 minutes
for someone to lightthe lamp
at the Joe, butboth teams got
on the board in the final min-
ute of the second frame.
The Spartans (7-11-2, 11-3-
4) scored the first goal of the
game with 53 seconds left in
the second period. On the
power play, Michigan State
freshman Jake Chelios fired a
shot from the slot that passed
senior netminder Shawn
Hunwick to get the Spartans
out to the early lead.
Michigan responded just
33 seconds later. Senior for-
ward Louie Caporusso slid
the puck across the crease
and scored on Yanakeff.
The equalizer was Capo-
russo's eighth goal of the sea-
son, but his first tally in one
month - his last goal came
at the Joe in the GLI Cham-
pionship against Colorado
College.
"Those last minute goals
are important goals, and that
was an important goal for
us," Berenson said. "It was
a great effort by Louie, and
you wanted that to go into
the (third) period. I can't say
it did."
The Spartans went up 2-1
just under eight minutes into
the third period on a shot
from the point through traf-
fic that Michigan State soph-
omore Joey Shean picked up
down low and slid past Hun-
wick.
Just over two minutes
later - with five minutes
remaining in the game - the
Wolverines got their best
chance of the night when

sophomore forward Kevin
Lynch was given a penalty
shot after being tripped on a
breakaway.
At the time the penalty
shot was awarded, Michigan
and Michigan State were on
a 4-on-4 due to roughing,
and Berenson elected to have
Lynch take the penalty shot
instead of taking the 4-on-3
power play option.
Unfortunately for the
Wolverines, Lynch missed
the opportunity to tie the
game up at two, as his shot
hit Yanakeff's left pad.
"Penalty shots, they're not
easy to score," Caporusso
said. "They're tough. I kind
of felt bad for him. All that
pressure, everyone is going
crazy. (After he missed the
shot) we thought we'd just
keep coming.
"That's our plan, we
always try to play consistent
hockey, try to keep coming,
keep coming. Unfortunately,
they got one, and we were
unable to (respond)."
Saturday's loss to the
Spartans snapped Michi-
gan's five-game win streak
and dropped the Wolverines
back to second place in the
CCHA.
Heading into two games
at Miami (Ohio), the Wolver-
ines know they need to put
this game - and the chances
they couldn't capitalize on
- behind them to come out
firing against the team that
ended Michigan's season in
the NCAA regional last year.
"You've got to give credit
to Michigan State," Capo-
russo said.
"I thought they did a great
job. They handled us in our
zone at times ... that can be
frustrating. We're playing
pretty consistent hockey,
and we didn't give it our best
today. We weren't good in an
awful lot of areas around the
ice. We'll be better come next
week."

teammate he could be and for not
playing up to his abilities.
It was in that team meeting
that Morris displayed the matu-
rity that this team's point guard
has been lacking. For a sopho-
more in college to go before his
peers, his teammates, the guys
he spends the most amount of
time with and look within him-
self and be able to verbalize that
he is sorry, is nothing short of
impressive.
Most kids his age would senda
Facebook or text apology. But not
Morris.
But what may be an even big-
ger contribution from that team
meeting was that Morris's lead-
ership inspired other guys to look
at their own performances.
"Everybody else stepped up
too and said they've been lacking
too atbeing agoodteammate and
holding each other accountable
to go out there and playing hard
all the time," Morris said.
And then Morris and his team-
mates, humbled and re-centered,
entered Breslin Arena and took
down No. 25 Michigan State.
But wait, it only got better.
On Sunday, against Iowa, the
sophomore registered a triple-
double - the first of his career,
the third in University history.
Twelve points, 11 assists, 10
rebounds. Any of those three
stats on their own would be
pretty impressive, but to put
them all together, is incredible.
But it wasn't Morris's talent
alone that earned him that sta-
tistic line - his teammates had
to catch the passes he threw,
other teammates had to throw
assists for him when he scored,
post players had to clear out the
big men for Morris to clean up
the glass.
And when that talent is sup-

ported by humility, hard work
and consideration for one's
teammates is more impressive
than the fact that Morris did
what's only been done twice
before.
He's young - he will have
ups and downs. I'm not expect-
ing that he'll go out and shock
the world every game. But for a
guy to be down, know he's down
and figure out how to get himself
out of that hole means that he's
learning and getting better. And
maybe the next hole wouldn't be
so deep or his shovel will be big-
ger.
Michigan coach John Beilein

said after the Michigan State
game that he would be able to
tell everyone in March whether
the 61-57 win marks a turn in the
season.
Maybe Beilein can't wait until
March to tell if it was a turn for
his team this season - but it was
for Morris.
Call him D-Mo or call him The
Butterfly, as one commentator
dubbed him after he came out
of his cocoon early this season.
Just don't wait until March to
see what kind of a player Mor-
ris allows himself to be when he
plays to his potential and makes
everyone around him better.

said both games could have
easily gone to the Nanooks,
but his team found a wayto
win.
But as the final buzzer
sounded atthe Joe on Satur-
day, Michigan's alarm clock
finally went off as well. It lost
a game it should have lost and
needed to lose.
Let me repeat that: the
Wolverines needed to lose.
While some can view the
2-1 score asa minor weekend
blunder against an in-state
rival - one who played tough-
nosed hockey againstone of
the conference's best teams -
the defeathas larger implica-
tions for the Michigan hockey
program.
This upcoming weekend,
the Wolverines travel to
Oxford, Ohio to face one of
the conference's most talent-
ed squads in Miami and two
of the nation's best players in
Andy Miele and Carter Camp-
er. The duo leads the country
with 49 and 46 points, respec-
tively.
To compound the Wol-
verines'matters, the hottest

team in the CCHA - Western
Michigan - comes to Ann
Arbor in three weeks. The
Broncos haven'tlostin11
games and have climbed to
fourth in the conference. Led
by freshman forward Chase
Balisy, who leads the team
with 26 points, and a defense
that has surrendered more
than two goals only once in
the past 11 games, Western
Michigan finds itself in an
unfamiliar position - the
Broncos finished dead last
this past season in the CCHA.
Clearly, the road to a poten-
tial regular-season conference
title for Michigan doesn't get
any easier from here on out,
and in a way, the Wolver-
ines should be thankingthe
Spartans. The loss brought
Michigan back to reality and
made it realize that it cannot
continue winning games play-
ing the way it's been over the
past few weekends.
I won't get into X's and O's
because, frankly, the issue
isn't strategic. Sure, the Wol-
verines could clean up the
defensive end and playa little
more sound defensively. They
could even capitalize on a few
more chances.
The point of contention

centers around the team's
ability to go out and compete.
Earlier in the season, Beren-
son acknowledged that the
team is more of a "blue-collar,
lunch-buckethockey team"
than in years past. It doesn't
have the likes of Brendan
Morrison, Jack Johnson or
Kevin Porter - some of the
most heralded and flashy
Wolverines in recent memory.
In mid-November, fol-
lowing a weekend split with
Nebraska-Omaha, Berenson
said, "We've got to kick 'em in,
deflect 'em in, bounce 'em in."
The team can take some
advice from the tenured coach
and play a more old-school
brand of hockey.
At times on Saturday and
throughout the past few
weekends, the Wolverines
have started slowly only to
have to claw back into the
game (i.e. the 4-3 overtime
loss to Michigan State on
Jan. 7).
But for now, the alarm
clock's still ringing - and has
been for quite some time.

his team too. The morelhe found
scoring opportunities under-
neath, the more Iowa (1-8, 13-8)
keyed in on him and forgot about
shooters like Smotrycz and Hard-
away Jr. on the perimeter.
"We had a little bit of a size
advantage, and we just tried to
feed it," Morgan said. "We have
such deadly shooters that it puts
these teams in a pickle. They have
to decide, 'Are they going to give
us a three? Or are they going to
give us a two?"'
Morgan did struggle a bit on
the defensive end, allowing Iowa
freshman forward Melsahn Bas-
abe to score 25 points against
Michigan's frontcourt, though
Beilein believes that the positives
outweighed the negatives. The

improvements on the offensive
end were extraordinary.
Perhaps most impressive was
how he Wolverines attackedhl c
Ho ye 2-3 zone scheme. After
Minnesota held Michigan-to 64
points just last week, using the
2-3 for a majority of the game, the
Wolverines seemingly couldn't
solve the defensive scheme.
"Minnesota (used the zone),
and we didn't have great tim-
ing," Beilein said. "And that's all
it takes, and you get a little bit
spooked byit... We had open shots
(against Iowa), we made them -
that was the big thing. You can
execute the heck out of a zone, but
if the ball goes in and out, you can
get spooked again."
For now, Michigan is far from
spooked by anything, as the team
takes a two-game winning streak
into Columbus to take on No. 1
Ohio State on Thursday.


Michigan travels to Naples
for alumni scramble match

With a white blanket of
snow covering the University
of Michigan Golf Course, and
a gray layer of clouds hover-
ing above it, the Michigan
women's golf team escaped to
green, sunny Florida to take
on three former alumni in a
scramble match on Saturday.
The current Wolverines
topped former teammates
Ashley Bauer (class of 2010),
Laura Olin (2005), and Kim
Benedict (2003) by four
strokes in the friendly event
at Grey Oaks Country Club
in Naples. The team split
into three foursomes, each
led by an alumna. Benedict's
squad of freshman Alyssa
Shimel, junior Meagan Bauer,
and assistant coach Chris-

sie George combined for
10-under par in the scramble
event to take the victory.
Shimel turned the low
score of the team with a 69,
followed by Bauer's 72 and
sophomore Caramia Sitom-
pul's 73.
The event also served as a
tune-up for the team's upcom-
ing tournament in Puerto
Rico beginning on Feb. 13.
"Some of the girls hadn't
been on grass for a while so
it was a good opportunity to
get down there and play and
practice," Michigan coach
Cheryl Stacy said.
"It was really to get out
there and get the kinks out
and the rust ... We've been hit-
ting alot of balls and chipping
and putting indoors, but it is
different when you're actually
on the grass."

In Puerto Rico, the team
will face what Stacy described
as a very competitive field.
She added that she would be
pleased with a top-five finish,
but that it is difficult to have
expectations this early in the
golf season with the team still
shaking off the winter rust.
The Florida trip - which
the team makes almost every
year - gives the team the
opportunity to work out some
of those kinks.
"It was agood weekend, we
had good weather, the girls
really seemed to enjoy it, they
seemed to play well, and we
were out there all day long,
so it was good," Stacy said. "It
was nice seeing ... Benedict,
Olin and Bauer, three play-
ers that did a lot for Michi-
gan and had a good record
throughout their careers...

Blue disappoints on road
against lowly Minnesota

Freshman Shaun Bernstein won his consolation match over Corrado Tocci, 6-0, 6-0.
'M' ousted at ITA Kickoff

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
Virginia Tech's Corrado Tocci
may not have ordered a bagel on
Saturday, but Michigan men's
tennis team fresman Shaun Ber-
nstein served him two, anyway.
In an overall disappointing
weekend, Bernstein gave the
Wolverines something to cheer
about, winning 6-0, 6-0 - the
rare "double bagel."
The win helped No. 24 Michi-
gan get past No. 25 Virginia Tech
in the consolation round of the
ITA Kickoff Weekend in Dur-
ham, N.C. by a score of 4-2 after
the Wolverines were shut out
by No. 14 Duke, 7-0, in the first
round.
"(Bernstein's win) was impres-
sive," Michigan coach Bruce
Berque said. "(Tocci) is really
good, normally plays at the top
half of their lineup. We watched
him play yesterday, and he won
against the kid from Pepperdine.
It doesn't surprise me that Shaun
bounced back.
"He's serious about the sport.
His win was"big for himself, and
big for the team. To tie the match
so quickly after losing the dou-
bles point really swung momen-
tum back to our side and gave our
guys alot of confidence."
Bernstein leads the team -
along with senior captain Jason
Jung - with 11wins this season.
Jung won at No. 2 and fresh-
man Barrett Franks won at No. 6,
both in straight sets.
The Wolverines also benefit-
ted from a straight-sets win from
sophomore Evan King at No. 1
singles that clinched the victory
for Michigan.

"Virginia Tech is a good team,"
Berque said. "We watched their
match with Pepperdine yester-
day and knew that we would have
our hands full today. It's not easy
to beat a team like that. We com-
peted well on every court."
But Michigan lost the doubles
point for the third consecutive
match - a red flag as Big Ten play
approaches.
"Doubles is disappointing,
obviously." Berque said. "We'll
get better there. Evan and Jason
played a lot better. We didn't play
well or execute well today and
they did. Give them credit. Our
doubles play needs to get better,
and we're confident that it will."
The Wolverines' No. 1 duo of
Jung and King did get a routine
8-3 win, but the remaining two
pairs lost, giving the Hokies the
point. Freshman Alex Buzzi
made his dual-match debut with
a loss at No. 3.
And things were even worse
in doubles for Michigan on Fri-
day against Duke, as it lost two
matches fairly easily to allow the
Blue Devils to jump out to a 1-0
lead.
The third match was aban-
doned after Duke clinched the
point, with Michigan trailing 8-7.
In singles play, Duke sustained
its dominance, winning all six
matches - five ofthemin straight
sets.
Bernstein almost got the Wol-
verines off the schneid as he was
leadingf6-3, 4-3 late in the second
set. But he struggled from then
on, losing the next three games
and then finally succumbing to
Fred Saba of Duke, 10-6, in a
super tiebreaker.
It was a solid showing by Bern-

stein, but it wasn't enough to stop
Duke from shutting out Michi-
gan.
The Wolverines' loss knocked
them out of contention for a
berth at the ITA National Team
Indoors Championship - an
event they haven't qualified for
since the 2008-09 season.
But despite the lopsided loss,
Michigan (2-2 overall) showed
resiliency, bouncing back the
next day with a solid win against
the Hokies.
"I think they responded well
(to the loss against Duke)," Ber-
que said. "This was our first time
playing back-to-back matches,
which isn't a problem physi-
cally, but we came here with the
thought of winning two matches
and making it to the ITA National
Team Indoor Championships."
Duke also may be under-
ranked even at No. 14, as it boasts
a lineup that includes the Nos. 5,
9 and 118 singles players in the
country, as well as the No. 12
doubles team.
The Wolverines have just one
ranked singles player in No. 35
Jung and one ranked doubles pair
in No. 28 Jung and King.
"To go out and get beat pretty
decisively by Duke (Friday) was
certainly a disappointing loss,"
Berque said after bouncing back
against Virginia Tech. "We have
a lot of freshmen on our team,
and to see them respond so well
out there today was encouraging.
I could tell right away.
"We were on the court practic-
ing at about 7:30 this morning to
get that taste out of our mouth.
These guys are all eager to get
better. They came out with a lot
of energy and alot of confidence."

Daily Sports Writer
The halftime scene in Min-
neapolis looked quite similar to
that of Thursday's game against
Ohio State - Michigan went
into the locker room trailing by
a hefty margin.
But the difference between
a comeback victory against
the 24th-ranked Buckeyes and
Sunday's
60-50 loss MICHIGAN 50
to Min- MINNESOTA 60
nesota - a
team that had only one previous
win in the Big Ten - was resil-
"The game was honestly
determined in the first 10 min-
utes of play," Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth said after the
game. "Minnesota made us exert
so much energy with physical
play and from that point on it
affected out shooting."
In fact, the game may have
been decided even earlier than
that. The Wolverines (6-3 Big'
Ten, 13-8 overall) didn't make
their first field goal until five
minutes into play - after already
turning the ball over four times.
Michigan usually takes good
care of the ball, but the Gophers
(2-7, 10-12) frustrated the Wol-
verines offensively with their
tight defensive play.
Michigan's first frame was
plagued by more turnovers than
field goals, as the Wolverines
went just 7-for-25.
"We didn't set screens in the
first half and when we did, we
didn't hold them," Borseth said.
"We got pushed around and
bumped around. And (Minne-
sota) just came up and literally
out-physicalled us."
After making the first shot of
the game, the Gophers, shooting
35.4 percent, carried the lead for
the rest of the contest. But the
Wolverines did have opportuni-
ties to come back, bringing the
game to within one possession
on a handful of occasions.
Sparked by the energetic
defensive play of sophomore
guard Jenny Ryan, who tallied
three assists and two steals dur-
ing the game, Michigan went
on a 7-0 run with over 15 min-
utes left to play. The Wolverines
continued to chip away at the
Gophers' and Michigan came
within one point.
Sophomore center Rachel

JAMESWEAVER/G
Senior guard Veronica Hicks had eight points and five rebounds yesterday.

Sheffer, coming off a hot offen-
sive game against Ohio State,
led the team in scoring with 13
points. Junior guard Courtney
Boylan added to the mix with 10
points of her own, but the rest
of the Wolverines looked rather
stagnant on offense - especially
Ryan and senior guard Veron-
ica Hicks, who only tallied two
points each.
But Michigan looked tired
on its last few trips to the bas-
ket - taking quick shots rather
than putting the ball on the floor
and moving it around - and that
affected its transition back to
defense.
Minnesota took advantage of
a few misses by the Wolverines
and regained a considerable lead
as the clock ran out.
"I think all in all when we
were coming down to tie up
the game, or get into the lead,
we would get a turnover or
they would limit us to one shot
and out, or we would just get
an unlucky call," Hicks said. "I
think that kind of took some of
the momentum out of us and
then (Minnesota) would come
down and score. We needed to
getastop, butthey wouldget the
rebound or make the shot that
we were supposed to make."
Though the loss to Minne-

sota was unrivaled compared to
Michigan's last performance, it
was not a negative sign for the
program. The Gophers' 1-7 con-
ference record prior to Sunday's
game does not doesn't neces-
sarily reflect its level of play in
every game.
The Gophers were handlhd
in their home-opener against
Illinois, then lost to Indiana ty
just one point in overtime, and
were defeated by Iowa only after
a 14-point Hawkeye comeback,
Minnesota is a strong BigTeT
team that just doesn't have 'te
numbers to boast it.
"It was just an absolutd
smash-mouth basketball game
and we got beat up," Bors-.
eth said. "It was a very phy i'
cal game, almost like playing
against Stanford or Connecticut!
It was that physical and we jtst
got beat early on."
Borseth also reinforced lie1
fact that it is difficult to win
games on the road. He told his
team before the season began
that they would be lucky to get
one road win, but Michigan has g
clearly defied that.
The Wolverines have notched
four wins on opposing courts,
including two wins against
ranked opponents Iowa and
Ohio State.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
Nguyen and Critser's singles wins
push Wolverines past Southern Cal

By HEIKO YANG
Daily Sports Writer

About 90 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, nestled in the rain shad-
ow of the Santa Ynez mountains,
the city of Santa Barbara has 300
sunny days a year, January tem-
peratures in the 60s and the lon-
gest stretch of east-west shoreline
thatisn't in the Gulf of Mexico.
Perhaps the only similarity that
the school there has with the Uni-
versity of Michigan is a fierce pride
in its aquatic sports. Its women's
water polo team owns a cool 7-0
all-time record against the Wol-
verines, and it went into thisweek-
end looking to add another win to
that record.
But it couldn't add an eighth vic-
tory.
After losing to the No. 1 team
in the country the previous week,
the No. 7 Michigan women's water
polo team bounced back to sweep
all six of its games at the Univer-
sity of California-Santa Barbara
Winter Invitational Tournament,
beating the home team in the first
game and then four other nation-
ally ranked California teams along
the way.
"It's kind of unbelievable for
Michigan, a midwestern team, to
fly out to the West Coast and play
six games in a row and go unde-
feated," said senior Lauren Orth,
who is from Poway, Calif. "I don't
think we've ever gone undefeated
in California before."

Michigan tops
Auburn, 7-0,
and USC, 5-2, on
successful weekend
By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
For the second time in three
hours, the same two playerswere
left on the court, with two points
left to be decided. The weekend
outcome hung in the balance.
The No. 8 Michigan women's
tennis team was ahead of No. 18
Southern California, 3-2, leaving
the decision up to either sopho-
more Mimi Nguyen at the fourth
singles slot or freshman Sam
Critser, sitting at No. 2.
Nguyen clinched her match
first, beating Kaitlyn Christian,
6-4, 5-7, 7-5, to give the Wolver-
ines the victory and an invitation
to the ITA National Team Indoor
Championships. The University
of Virginia is hosting this year's
event from Feb. 18-21.
Critser played her match out
- and for good reason. After los-
ing her first set 5-7, the fresh-
man came striking back against
tenth-ranked Danielle Lao in the
second, taking the set 6-2. It took
Critser 180 minutes to defeat
the Trojan sophomore, but she
secured the upset, and the Mich-
igan win, with a 6-4 tally in the
third.
