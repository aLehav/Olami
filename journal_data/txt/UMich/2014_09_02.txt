Schlissel met with
campus leaders to
discuss leading issues
on campus

The Michigan Daily ia publiahing
an article each day this week to cover
the start of UniversityPresident Mark
Schlissel's first semester. He will be
formally installed as the University's
14thpresident duringa day ofinaugu-
ration festivities Friday.
Familiarize yourself with cam-
pus; meet new people; move to a new
home in a new city. Apparently, the
experiences of a new president and
a first-year student are not so differ-
ent.
Since starting his new job in mid-
July, Schlissel has been busy prepar-
ing for the school year. In the last
few weeks, he has met with a group
of student leaders and opened his

home to University students and
parents for introductions, pictures
and ice cream.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, said both
August gatherings demonstrate the
president's desire to be visible and
involved in student activities.
"I think he is going to continue
that tradition of being engaged with
students," Harper said at the Aug. 28
open house. "He's been really clear
(about that)."
Schlissel launched the initia-
tive to improve his administration's
relationships with students with a
small roundtable of representatives
from the University's largeststudent
organizations on Aug. 20.
Organizations present included
Central Student Government, the
Black Student Union, The Michigan
Daily, Hillel and Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality.
CSG President Bobby Dishell,
a Public Policy senior, said Schlis-
sel's newness has been a key driver
behind his push to engage with stu-
dents. He added that student leaders

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Shiokar steps
down from
VP position

CSG vice president
resigns to undergo
medical treatment
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
LSA junior Meagan Shokar,
Central Student Government
vice president, announced in
a statement Friday afternoon
she would be stepping down
from her position in CSG.
Shokar was elected last
winter by the student body,
along with her presidential
running mate, Public Policy
senior Bobby Dishell, for the
2014-2015 academic year.
The statement, released on
social media, cited an injury
and resulting treatment plan
as the reason for the decision,
and thanked the student body
and University administration
for their support during her
time in CSG, as well as Dishell
for his understanding.
In an interview Saturday,
Shokar said she is disappoint-
ed to be stepping down from

the role, but wants to ensure
her replacement can be fully
dedicated to the role's respon-
sibilitiesboth interms of time
and physical ability to get the
job done, which she said she
is unable to do at the moment.
"At this point, I'm taking
my life back to basics," she
said. "And that means classes,
and my treatment, and there's
not really much else I can do
right now."
Both Shokar and Dishell
indicated in a separate social
media announcement that
they would like to see LSA
senior Emily Lustig succeed
Shokar. Lustig was a co-chair
of Make Michigan, the party
Dishell and Shokar ran with
in the CSG elections. She has
also served as the chair of
the CSG Campus Safety and
Security Commission for two
years.
"She's always cared about
CSG, especially about the stu-
dents in general, in so many
ways and so much," Shokar
said. "She's just an extraordi-
nary leader, and I've just been

Student orgs. join
forces to highlight
campus diversity
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
University students were given
a taste - and sight and sound - of
other cultures Monday at UMOJA
Fest, a day-long event dedicated
to promoting cultural awareness
through traditional food, music,
and dance.
Several student organizations

dedicated to cultural awareness,
including the Black Student Union,
the South Asian Awareness Net-
work, the Native American Stu-
dents Association, the Michigan
Latin Assembly and the Persian
Students Association, collaborated
to provide an opportunity for stu-
dents to see cultural diversity on
campus firsthand. The event fea-
tured free food, drinks, dance per-
formances and carnival games, and
was open to all students and mem-
bers of the Ann Arbor community.
The Swahili word "umoja"
translates to "unity," reflecting the
partnership of these groups in put-

ting this event together. BSU Vice
Speaker Geralyn Gaines, an LSA
senior, said the UMOJA Fest is a
way for students to become more
culturally aware.
"It's really easy togetlostinyour
own sheltered community," Gaines
said. "Just to open up your eyes
and to see maybe I should try this
food, or this dance looks really cool,
maybe I should talk to somebody
about it, or just to give people an
opportunity that they may not have
had otherwise during Welcome
Week."

CRAZE
From Page 1A
freshman year, and said the sense
of community around this Wel-
come Week event is unlike any
other within the LGBTQ commu-
nity.
"This is such a great event,
especially for a lot of the younger
people here at the University who
are coming from a place that may
not be very supportive. I was one of
those people, and it was an amaz-
ing experience to be able to see how
large this community is," Jendry
said. "I feel really connected to the
people here, and for the people who
may just be becoming comfortable
with themselves, to see all of the
student organizations be accepting
of them is reallygreat."
Junichi Shimaoka, coordinator
of liaison services at the Univer-
sity's Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services, was a representative
at the "Do Something" display put
on at the event by CAPS. Shimaoka
said Gayz Craze is an opportunity
for CAPS to spread hope to new
and returning students, emphasiz-
ingthat 24 percent ofstudents have
had thoughts of suicide in the last
two months, and that this number
is larger within LGBTQ communi-
ties.
"We all know someone who has
been touched by suicide," Shimao-
ka said. "We want to try to reduce
the stigma and create more of a
sense of hope. Students within the
LGBTQ community are very open
to talking about mental issues and
trying to promote a positive mes-
sage."
Summer LaPointe, an LSA
freshman, said she saw Gayz Craze

as an opportunity to get to know
the LGBTQ communityon campus.
"I'm pansexual, so an event
like this is really exciting for me,"
LaPointe said. "I am really glad
that this is happening. Back home,
my parents are really strict, so I
wouldn't have been able to go to an
event like this before."
Similarly, LSA sophomore Alex
Ingraham said he volunteered at
the event to reach out to students
who might not be aware of campus
possibilities.
"In my high school, we
wouldn't have something like
this, so I think it's something
that's important to be promoted
and to bring this kind of educa-
tion to students," he said.
This year, organizers added
a wider range of organizations,
including groups that wanted to
express their support of mem-
bers of the LGBTQ community,
such as the Society for Women
Engineers, Blood Drive United,
Beta Theta Pi, Ross Out For Busi-
ness, Forward on Climate, CAPS,
the Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center, K-grams,
the Secular Student Alliance,
Lord of Light Lutheran Church,
Advocates for Mental Health and
Students for Choice. SAPAC and
CAPS both had large displays
centering on self-esteem.
"It's a big tradition now. The
thing we did this year is we decid-
ed to bring in more organizations.
Instead of justhaving a few LGBTQ
organizations, we're opening it up
to a lot more organizations, making
it an event that is inclusive to every-
one as it should be. We have a lon-
ger lineup of performances, more
entertainment," Bourke said. "Per-
sonally, I went last year and met all
of my best friends there."

VP

so privileged to work with her."
In an interview Friday,
Dishell said Lustig is the clear
choice to fill the position.
"She's incredibly well-versed
in CSG, has worked on a vari-
ety of successful initiatives,
I've worked closely with her in
the past both in high pressure
situations and also low pres-
sure situations," he said. "She's
a great writer, great messenger
and just gives a really great per-
spective that's very different
from mine on all sorts of events
that happened on campus and
things that come up during the
year."
In a statement on Facebook,
Lustig thanked Shokar for her
dedication, passion and hard
work in CSG, and stated that
she would be proud to assume
the role.
Dishell said they chose to issue
the announcement and relat-
ed statements on social media
because of the nature of the deci-
sion.
"It's a personal issue, and we
went ahead and made a state-
ment," he said. "There's vari-
ous medias in which we make
statements, and as you know,
social media is one way to go on
the record about something, so
that's why we decided to go that
way."
To officially replace Shokar,
Lustig will first be vetted by
the CSG Executive Nomina-
tions Committee, which will
make a recommendation to the
full CSG Assembly. She will

then need to be approved by the
Assembly with a simple major-
ity vote, according to CSG inter-
im counsel Justin Kingsolver, a
Law School student. The vote
on Lustig's confirmation could
occur as early as the first CSG
meeting of the year on Tuesday.
Dishell said there was an
internal vetting process with
several candidates prior to the
choice to put Lustig forward for
the position. He said he learned
of Shokar's decision to step
down relatively recently, but
he added that he felt there was
enough notice.
"It was somewhat recent, but
not something that's been going
on for a very long time," Dishell
said. "It's not a big secret we've
kept."
Both Dishell and Shokar have
worked on several initiatives
for CSG during the summer,
including the Night Owl bus
route and the Wolverine Sup-
port Network, which focuses on
supplementing mental health
resources on campus. Both ini-
tiatives came from the running
mates' campaign platform.
Shokar said she plans to
remain involved in an advisory
capacity with CSG to whatever
extent she's able to, notably
with the Wolverine Support
Network project. Dishell said he
didn't anticipate any delays in
the initiatives despite the tran-
sition, and added that Lustig
has previously been involved
in much of their planning and
implementation.
"(I'm) fully confident in Emi-
ly's abilities, and very sad to see
Meagan go, but looking forward
to continuing to work hard for
the student body," he said.

SCHLISSEL
From Page 1A
are some of the best people to
help the new president become
acclimated to the University.
Dishell added that an impor-
tant goal will be to strengthen
the administration's ties to the
initiatives of CSG and other
organizations - for example, the
Night Owl bus route - to help
sustain new student services and
resources.
"One thing I've learned ... is
that there's a lot of great ideas,
but if someone isn't incredibly
passionate about it, unless you
really institutionalize it, three
years will go by and the program
will be gone," Dishell said.
BSU Speaker Arnold Reed,
an LSA senior, said the meeting
indicated an effort to further
open up communication across
all facets of the University -
an effort he thinks will help
improve campus climate and
increase connectivity among all
types of University resources.
"The administration has been
very proactive this year in terms
of reaching out to us," Reed said.
"I think especially after last year,
they're really making a con-
scious effort to say, 'Hey, what is
it that we can do for you?' If what
has been goingon here lately car-
ries on to the school year, it'll be
an amazingyear."
Reed said his biggest concern,
which he and others brought up
in the meeting, is that while the
University has a set of incred-
ible opportunities, it lacks "one
thread that really unifies, or
unites or lets everybody know all

of these things."
LSA junior Becca Levin, Hil-
lel's Israel cohort chair, said it
will be necessary not only to give
students a greater awareness of
the University's vast resources,
but also of one another.
"I really think that Michigan
promises from the beginning
that it will make a big school
small, and I think that Michigan
sticks to that ... everyone finds
their niche," Levin said. "The
flipside of that is that, as we get
further in our careers as Michi-
gan students, we sometimes
don't branch out of our groups,
and so there's a lot of amazing
people on our campus that we
don't meet."
She called for some kind of
extracurricular avenue that stu-
dents can use to both meet new
people and sit down to discuss
difficult issues on campus.
LSA senior Tala Dahbour, a
SAFE co-chair, said she hopes
the meeting was "just the begin-
ning."
"We're hoping that President
Schlissel continues meetingwith
us... as marginalized students on
campus, we've never really had
that platformtobe heard, and we
appreciate any time that the Uni-
versity invites us to speak with
them."
At Schlissel's open house,
Harper said the informal lunch
with student leaders is far from
an anomaly; rather, it demon-
strates Schlissel's desire to learn
from the University community.
"We were teasinghim because
he just moved into the house this
morning," she said last week.
"Students are moving in and
unpacking, you're moving in and
unpacking... doing the same."


UMOJA
From Page lA
dent of the Persian Students Asso-
ciation, said the collaborative effort
provided a way for the cultural
groups on campus to get to know
each other.
One of the day's many perfor-
mances featured a traditional Native

American drumperformance bythe
Miskwaasining Nagamojig, mean-
ing"Swamp Singers"in Ojibwe. This
nonprofit group aims to preserve and
revitalize Ojibwe, a Native American
language.
"I think a lot of the audience
enjoyed it; they were very interac-
tive" said University alum Jasmine
Pawlicki, a former member of the
Native American Student Associa-
tion. "Maybe if we had been louder

or had speakers we may have drawn
more people, but I don't know how
often people get to hear pan-tribal
music at the Diag."
LSA junior Kidada Malloy said
she came to the festival to support
the Black Student Union and to meet
new students.
"It's important because it brings
together students from different
backgrounds and communities,"
Malloy said.

Although many student groups
put on cultural events, Gaines and
other members of the BSU said there
should be more initiative from the
University to promote these events.
"The BSU has been doing this
for a long time but that's just some-
thing we decided to do,"Gaines said.
"I think if the University put forth
more effort of having events like this
it would not be up to the students to
do it."

In the past year, a host of student
organizations have demonstrated a
desire for increased discussion about
race on campus. The BSU launched
the #BBUM movement through
Twitter in November to share expe-
riences of being Black at the Univer-
sity and raise awareness on issues of
race and diversity on campus. The
campaign expanded to a nation-
wide conversation, extending to
other universities.

The administration considered
the concernsraisedbythe movement
and facilitated a dialogue thatresult-
ed in a plan to renovate the existing
Trotter Multicultural Center and
search for a building space closer to
Central Campus in the future.
Though future events have not
beensetinstone,thegroupsinvolved
in UMOJA Fest plan to have more
collaborative events throughout the
year.

PAUL SHERMAN,;

Don't do stupid s***

I remember having a discussion
with one of my friends in Paris
about American foreign policy. On
a warm spring day in the City of
Lights;she asked me, "What should
Obama do to protect American
interests abroad?" I thought I
could summarize it in a couple of
words: "Don't Do Stupid Shit." And
that's what this administration has
attempted to do.
Up until recently, the American
public hasn't complained too much
about President Barack Obama's
foreign policy more or less. It
appears, however, that this is
starting to change.
According to a poll released by
The New York Times last week, 58
percent of Americans disapprove
of Obama's foreign policy, in light
of the recent actions of the Islamic
State in Iraq and Syria in Iraq,
particularly as ISIS advances on
Baghdad. The Washington Post
and FiveThirtyEight have posted
similar findings.
This policy presents a confusing
conundrum for Obama, as
Drezner found:
"Indeed, if one digs into the
NYT/CBS poll, one finds that
majorities of Americans support
the specific steps that the Obama
administration is proposing on Iraq.
Fifty-one percent support sending
in advisers to the Iraqi military, 56
percent support the greater use of
drones, (I didn't know whether to
get rid of the oxford comma since
it's a quote, but there's one here)and
77 percent do not support sending
in ground troops. Nevertheless, 52
percent of Americans disapprove
of the overall Iraq policy. Indeed,
the striking pattern is that when
Americans are asked about concrete
policies, majorities tend to support
the administration's position.
When asked about overarching
policy towards Iraq, or towards the
rest of the world more generally,

majorities now tend to dislike
what the administration is doing.
In other words, foreign policy is
the new Obamacare when it comes
to polling."'
This frustration is surprising
in that the President has followed
through on his promises and has
attempted to clean up the messy
policies that have hurt America
over the past decade.
I will not ignore the faults in his
policy (the sequel to "The Fault in
Our Stars"). Syria and Egypt have
been a mess to say the least. All of
the leaks that have occurred over
the years have created tensions
between the U.S. and its allies
(namely the NSA leaks). The
Ukrainian crisis has put strains on
already cool relations with Russia.
And the revelations of drone strikes
in Pakistan and Yemen haven't
helped either.
In spite of these blunders, Obama
has delivered on his word. Some
have called it the "Don't Do Stupid
Shit" Doctrine. In other words,
the President is trying to revive
relations with American allies and
adversaries as opposed to sending
in the ground troops.
Let'slookathisaccomplishments.
With the exception of some
military advisors helping to train
military and police forces in both
countries, he pulled most American
forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
The development of a new trade
treaty (the Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership) with
Europe that could be very beneficial
for both the U.S. and the EU is
underway. While talks have been
shaky recently, the U.S. and Iran
were able to make an important first
step towards a nuclear agreement.
Even if the P5+1 talks fail, Iran is
weaker than ever. Of course, Seal
Team Six successfully tracked
down and killed Osama Bin Laden.
In today's changing global

environment, the US is not going to
easily achieve all of its objectives.
Drezner raised another point that
is worth sharing: "The thing about
American foreign policy is that
even the best foreign policy outputs
do not necessarily translate into the
best outcome, because the United
States, for all its superpowery-ness,
is not actually an omnipotent deity.
In the case of Iraq, there are a lot of
other variables at play besides U.S.
foreign policy outputs: Maliki's
poor leadership, the neighboring
situation in Syria, the Kurdish
desire for an independent state,
Gulf funding of ISIS and Iran's
sway over the Maliki regime."
The point is that certain
"outputs" are out of America's
control, and Obama alone cannot be
blamed for that.
Furthermore, even though
the U.S. wouldn't like to admit it,
Washington needs to adjust to the
times. Fareed Zakaria in his book
The Post American World referred
to the "rise of the rest" and the
creation of a multipolar world.
With the rise of new powers such as
China, India and Brazil, in addition
to nations such as Germany, global
leaders have been able to develop
their own independent foreign
policies based on their economic
power. More factors today will be
out of America's control, and Obama
is preparing America for that reality.
At this point in time, it is hard
to tell what Obama's foreign policy
legacy will hold and what the
consequences of his policies will be.
For now, this administration is just
being realistic and adjusting to the
times, which is something America
needs to do sooner rather than
later. Hopefully, I will not have to
use "Don't Do Stupid Shit" when I
next talk to my Parisian friend.

y mom and I sat up in the stands
with dozens of other proud family
members as Marquette University's
faculty gave speech after
speech welcoming the new
freshman class. For these
new students, this was the 4
beginning of what someone
has undoubtedly told them
will be the best four years of
their lives. But not everyone
on campus was celebrating. VICTORIA
Recently, Marquette alum NOBLE
James Foley had been
brutally killed by Islamic,
State militants. The video of
his beheading had been made public worldwide,
and people from every corner of the earth
watched as a life was taken.
Yet, arising from this tragedy was one of the
most powerful arguments for higher education
that I've ever heard, anywhere. One of the
speakers at the freshmanf convocation centered
some of his remarks on Foley's death. Yet his
focus was markedly different from the media
refrainof(justified)disgustandoutrage. Instead,
his speech centered onthe work Foley was doing
before his kidnapping. Foley's murder was a
horrifyingtragedy, but he died usinghis position
and skills to inform others of the conditions in
the Middle East. He lived his life for others.
Sitting in that crowded gym, full of my little
brother's new peers and their parents teeming
withpride,Ibegan tounderstand whateducation
- something that I've now spent about 16 years
on - is all about. And it isn't about me; it's about
everyone else.
In our competitive academic world of
cutthroat classes, demanding assignments and
intense pressure to prepare for the so-called real
world, it's difficult to think about anyone but
ourselves. After all, only so many people can ace
that curved class, get into a top-tier grad school
or get hired by Goldman Sachs as a summer
intern. Helping others? That just might allow
someone else to steal away that cool internship
you'vebeen coveting.
But here's the thing - we can't be selfish with
our education. As students at the University, we
constitute an incredibly prestigious minority -
not because we go to college here, but because we

go anywhere at all. In our microcosmofpressure
and success, glamour and money, it may seem
like just about everyone except Bill Gates goes
to college nowadays. In reality, this couldn't be
further from the truth. Last year in the United
States, only 33.5 percent of 25-29 year olds held
a bachelor degree. Furthermore, in a global
context, the attainment of a college education is
even less widely dispersed. As of 2010, about 6.7
percent of the world's population held a college
degree, an improvement since 2000.
We are some of the most privileged people in
the world. We have the opportunity to learn. We
are generally safe. We have clean water, ample
amenities, a variety of affordable food options
and plenty of consumer goods.
And yet, with all of these incredible resources,
there is something missing. Our education is
totally useless unless it becomes a tool to improve
thelivesofothers.We have the ability tolearnthe
necessary information to create solutions to the
world's problems. And none of us can do it alone.
To move forward, we need each other.
And I guess that's the point of all that
reading, studying, paper writing, problem set
solving and model building. By maximizing
our opportunities to learn here, we are giving
ourselves the ability to really improve the lives
of others later on. We'll be equipped to go out
and address, expose, solve or otherwise improve
serious problems and situations in our world.
But more importantly, we're required to care.
Whether it be about a targeted people halfway
around the world or a little brother going off to
college, there is someone, somewhere, who can
benefit from you, from me, from whoever. And
whether we care about our families, ageopolitical
issue or anything else, it is our passion, interest
and sensitivity thatcmake the real difference.
I probably won't be flying to Syria as a
professional photojournalist to help educate
others on the struggle of a people - mostly
because I'm not a photographer. But I do have
other skills that I can use to build toward a life
serving others. We all have skills, and we're
learning them here, at the University. When we
leave Ann Arbor, we'll get to decide what kind
of life we want to lead. For me, the choice is very
clear: a life for others.

As I pressed the "End Call"
button on my phone, the memory
resurfaced amidst surging worries
about exams. It was one of those
memories I originally assumed was
perhaps too irrelevant to catalog
within the chaotic confines of
my mind. Yet, I've learned those
"forgotten" snippets of nostalgia
often sting the most. Immediately
after the conversation with my
best friend, I stared at the powdery
mountains accumulating outside
my window and recalled an
interaction from two years ago with
my former art teacher, a woman I
still admire to this day.
After offering me a wonderful
and under-appreciated compliment
aboutthe drawingI was working on,
my teacher worriedly asked if her
words had made me uncomfortable.
Easily discerning the perplexed
look plastered across my face, my
teacher explained I tended to look
down and cringe whenever she
complimented me. My best friend
confirmed I possessed this meek
and self-deprecating demeanor
with him as well. I never meant to
dismiss their kind words. Rather,
I was always self-conscious about
my work, and I assumed each piece
could've been improved in some
way. I've always detested scenarios
where I could feel the blistering
rays of the spotlight upon my skin,
but I couldn't believe I'd actually
reached a point where I was

recoiling from words of praise.
Little progress elapsed over the
past two years. The same support-
ive friend from that high school art
room futilely tried to congratulate
me and offer streams of accolades
for the first piece I wrote for The
Daily. He zealously encouraged me
to keep pursuing my writing aspi-
rations, and he was one of the first
people to convey how proud he was.
Yet, I regressed to my worn-out
strategy for receiving praise: Deny.
Deny. Deny. I volleyed excuse after
excuse to belittle my achievement.
While my confidence may be
lacking, low self-esteem unaccept-
ably plagues an extensive amount
of women in society. The Atlantic
writers Katie Kay and Claire Ship-
man confirm the cliched belief
women are our own worst critics in
their article "The Confidence Gap."
In fact, women undervalue their
capabilities and talents to such a
detrimental extent these doubts
create a gap in confidence between
women and men in the professional
world. Women negotiate their sala-
ries four times less than men, and
when women do garner the courage
to ask for a raise, they often request
30 percent less money. Therefore
the confidence gap helps to widen
the already hefty pay gap we are
fervently trying to combat.
However, money isn't the only
crucial issue regarding the "Con-
fidence Gap." Ironically, one of

most disappointing details is the
fact women's doubts are blockad-
ing them from opportunities and
careers they deserve - or are even
overqualified for. According to The
Atlantic article, women fixate on
perfectionism. For men, a mistake
may go unnoticed or be regarded as
an uncontrollable circumstance. If
women fumble in the slightest, we
attribute the mistakes to an inter-
nal flaw or a lack of ability. Conse-
quently, we refrain from embarking
on new opportunities or following
life-long passions. For example, if
a woman doesn't possess all of the 4
desired skills when applying for a
raise, she won't apply. Yet, a less-
er-qualified man with more confi-
dence definitely will.
As a feminist, I hate to perpetuate
any stereotypes, but I mustbegrudg-
ingly admit a sizeable amount of
women do tend to overthink. I'm
a classically trained over-thinker
who excels at doubting herself. Per-
haps this makes me a tad biased, but
I fully understand the inhibiting
effects of doubt and perfectionism.
With every compliment deflected or
challenge avoided, we - as women
- trick ourselves into believing we
are perpetual works in progress. We
accept the lies. Our fear of failure is
so paralyzing we surrender before
we even start.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Vice President
Biden says workers
deserve 'fair share'
U.S. workers deserve a "fair
share" of any improvement in
corporate profits, Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden told hundreds
of Detroit-area union members
Monday during the first of three
Labor Day stops in the city.
A job is "about your dignity.
It's about your place in the com-
munity. ... You can't do that
unless you get a fair wage," Biden
told the crowd gathered on the
grounds of the former Tiger Sta-
dium ahead of organized labor's
annual parade Monday.
He stuck with populist
themes, criticizing corporate
pay and companies that leave the
U.S. for lower taxes.
Workers don't want a handout,
said Biden, adding: "Just give
them a chance."
MILWAUKEE
Obama renews
push for raising
minimum wage
President Barack Obama
renewed his push for Congress
to raise the minimum wage
Monday in a buoyant accounting
of the economy's "revving" per-
formance, delivered on behalf
of Democrats opening their fall
campaigns for the midterm con-
gressional elections.
"America deserves a raise," he
told a union crowd in Milwau-
kee, vowing to keep a hard sell
on Congress in much the way
he once courted his wife. "I just
wore her down," he cracked.
Timing his push to Labor
Day, the traditional start of
the autumn campaign, Obama
aggressively drew attention to
recent economic gains, setting
aside past caution on that sub-
ject.
WASHINGTON
House and Senate
panels warn of
threat from Islamic
State fighters
Leaders of the House and
Senate intelligence committees
on Sunday prodded President
Barack Obama to take decisive
action against what they say are
growing threats from Islamic
State militants on U.S. soil.
The lawmakers, one Republi-
can and one Democratic, offered
bipartisan pressure on the White
House to turn back the hazard of
Islamist fighters who have taken
control of vast swaths of Syria
and Iraq. Those militants now
are looking toward the United
States or Western Europe for its
next targets, lawmakers said.
Without offering specifics on
any threats or suggestions how
to confront them, the lawmakers
said Obama soon needs to devel-

op a comprehensive strategy to
crush the fighters.
BERLIN
German chancellor
supports arming
Kurdish fighters
Chancellor Angela Merkel has
told lawmakers that it's in Germa-
ny's interests to arm the Kurdish
fighters who are battling Islamic
extremists in Iraq.
The government decided Sun-
day to send 16,000 assault rifles,
millions of rounds of ammunition,
hundreds of anti-tank weapons
and several armored vehicles to
forces fighting the Islamic State
group, breaking with Germany's
previous reluctance to send weap-
ons into conflicts.
Merkel on Monday told a spe-
cial session of parliament the deci-
sion was "very carefully weighed."
She said German officials faced
a choice between "taking no risks,
not delivering (weapons) and ulti-
mately accepting the expansion of
terror" or supporting those fight-
ing the extremists.

Schlissel makes
first remarks in
new student event

Annual convocation
welcomes freshmen
to the University
By JENNIFER CALFAS
ManagingNews Editor
When University President
Mark Schlissel approached the
podium in the Crisler Center for
the first time in his new role, he
was in good company. In front of a
crowd of several thousand fresh-
men at the New Student Convoca-
tion on Friday, Schlissel delivered
his first formal remarks to Uni-
versity undergraduates.
Immediately, Schlissel told the
University's newest batch of stu-
dents that they, like him, face the
challenge of adjusting to a new
environment.
"This evening, we begin our
Michigan journey together,"
Schlissel said.
Schlissel's speech came
between performances by stu-
dent groups and several other
addresses, including comments
by CSG President Bobby Dishell,
a Public Policy senior; Ted Spen-
cer, associate vice provost and
executive director of the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions; and
E. Royster Harper, vice president
for student life.
Schlissel began by address-
ing the obvious: As the 14th Uni-
versity president, he, like the
thousands of new freshmen, has
a lot to learn. After his first few
months, however, he already has
some advice to give.
"Have you figured out the
UGLi? If not, you will soon," he
said. "Learning the culture of the
Michigan community is a little
confusing at first, but soon none
of this will phase you."
Throughout his speech,
Schlissel lauded students for

their academic and personal
accomplishments that led to their
decision to attend the University.
He emphasized the value of a
University education, encourag-
ing students to make the most of
the academic and extracurricu-
lar resources offered.
"Drink from the academic fire
hose that is Michigan," Schlis-
sel said. "Learning at a research
university ... presents you unique
opportunities to discover, be
entrepreneurial and intellectu-
ally restless."
Harper echoed Schlissel's
remarks by highlighting the abil-
ity of students to make their own
mark on the University - which
she strongly encouraged.
"The University is a very
special and constantly evolv-
ing place; it's your universe,"
Harper said. "You need not leave
it or take it as it was when you
entered. We expect you to make
a contribution to the University
and the world."
In his speech, Spencer said
the class of 2018 was the "stron-
gest" class to have ever entered
the University - a characteristic
that has typically been associated
with each year's incoming class.
Though the class of 2018's
enrollment data will not be offi-
cially revealed until October,
Spencer said the freshmen are
"very diverse with strong rep-
resentation of racial, ethnic and
religious class."
Before closing his first set of
remarks to undergraduate stu-
dents, Schlissel quoted Mary
Oliver, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
poet, to pose a question for stu-
dents to carry throughout their
careers at the University.
"'Tell me: What is it you plan
to do with your one wild and
precious life?"' Schlissel recited.
"The answer begins here and
now."

City Council to discuss zoning,
affordable housing at meeting

Councilmembers
will also discuss
use of ridesharing
companies Thesday
The City Council will meet
Tuesday to consider resolutions
concerningzoning and ridesharing
companies. The Council will dis-
cuss the operation of Uber and Lyft
companies in Ann Arbor, aswell as
a fund transfer in support of a con-
tinuing affordable housing effort
and various zoning proposals.
Resolution: City
Administrator to negotiate
withridesharing companies
Councilmembers Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), Sally Hart Petersen
(D-Ward 2) and Christopher Tay-
lor (D-Ward 3) have announced
their sponsorship of a resolu-
tion that would recommend that
City Administrator Steve Powers
negotiate operating agreements
with companies such as Uber and
Lyft following last month's dis-
cussion regarding taxi ordinance

changes.
This resolution lists specific
parameters of such companies'
operation within the city of Ann
Arbor, including specifications
for acceptable drivers, required
driver background checks,
required reports from rideshar-
ing companies to the city and a
minimum insurance coverage of
$1 million.
Last month's approval of taxi-
cab rates will also be given final
consideration.
Resolution: Transfer of
$729,879 to West Arbor
affordable housing project
In support of the West Arbor
Section 8 rent-assisted housing
project,the Councilwillbevoting
to appropriate necessary funds to
fill a shortfall in the project's bud-
get of $16,564,370.
The Ann Arbor Housing Com-
mission is requesting aid fromthe
Council to make up the $729,879
difference not covered by the
Michigan State Housing Direc-
tory Authority and low-income
tax credits.

Council approved the project
on June 3 of last year, but this
additional transfer would come
from its affordable housing fund,
which currently has a balance of
$1,580,799.
Resolutions: Zoning
The Council will also be vot-
ing on various changes to zoning,
including approval of the Gift of
Life project and the demolition of
20 homes on North Maple Road in
order to construct a public hous-
ing apartment complex. Gift of
Life is a non-profit organization
that seeks to improve people's
quality of life by encouraging
quality organ and tissue dona-
tion.
Consideration for the Gift of
Life expansion was postponed
on Aug. 29 and will be given ini-
tial consideration at Tuesday's
meeting. This project concerns
the use of $10.5 million to add
a three-story building to the
existing Gift of Life research
facility in Ann Arbor, which is
contingent on the changes made
to zoning laws.

The constant stream of

Americans detained in North
Korea call for U.S. intervention

Washington sends
representative to
negotiate release
PYONGYANG, - North Korea
(AP) - North Korea gave foreign
media access on Monday to three
detained Americans who said
they have been able to contact
their families and - watched by
officials as they spoke - called for
Washington to send a high-rank-
ing representative to negotiate for
their freedom.
Jeffrey Fowle and Mathew
Miller said they expect to face
trial within a month. But they said
they do not know what punish-

ment they could face or what the
specific charges against them are.
Kenneth Bae, who already is serv-
ing a 15-year term, said his health
has deteriorated at the labor camp
where he works eight hours a day.
The three were allowed to
speak briefly with The Associated
Press at a meetingcenter in Pyong-
yang. North Korean officials were
present during the interviews,
conducted separately and in dif-
ferent rooms, but did not censor
the questions that were asked. The
three said they did not know they
were goingto be interviewed until
immediately beforehand.
All said they believe the only
solution to their situation is for
a U.S. representative to come to

North Korea to make a direct
appeal.
That has often been North
Korea's bargaining chip in the
past, when senior statesmen
including former President Bill
Clinton made trips to Pyongyang
to secure the release of detainees.
North Korea says Fowle and
Miller committed hostile acts
which violated their status as tour-
ists. Ithas announced that authori-
ties are preparing for the trial, but
has not announced the date.
In Washington, National Secu-
rity Council spokesman Patrick
Ventrell said, "We have seen the
reports of interviews with the
three American citizens detained
in North Korea."

Leaders rally downtown
for increased K-12 funds

Ross begins new initiative to
encourage startup growth

Educators, officials
and residents
criticize Snyder for
education policy
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor education and local
government leaders joined with
residents Thursday to advocate
for increased funding for the
city's public schools.
Held in Liberty Plaza in down-
town Ann Arbor, the rally high-
lighted statewide budget cuts on
K-12 and higher-level education
and the declining reputation of
Michigan public schools.
The speakers at the event,
which was hosted by Michigan
Teachers and Allies for Change,
included Linda Carter, presi-
dent of the Ann Arbor Educa-
tion Association, Jeanice Swift,
superintendent of Ann Arbor
Public Schools, Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) and Lisa Brown,
the Democratic candidate for
lieutenant governor.
Last week, Education Week
published a nationwide report
card last week comparing edu-
cation within states. Michigan
ranked eighth in the country for
K-12 education quality, 38th in
elementary reading and middle
school math and 40th in overall
high school graduation.
Citing this report, Swift,
the Ann Arbor Public Schools
superintendent, expressed her
frustration with state legislators
and criticized them for failing to
prevent this deterioration.
"While we've been having a
meltdown into mediocrity with
regard to how we fund public
education, other states have
mobilized and moved ahead of
us," she said.
Carter, the president of the

AAEA, echoed this sentiment,
inviting legislators into class-
rooms to assess the declining
condition of public schools.
Encouraging protesters to
sing along to her rendition of
a workers' union anthem, she
rallied the crowd of fellow edu-
cators to take a stand against
budget cuts.
"This is unacceptable," Carter
said. "We're not going to take it
anymore."
Though M-TAC, the host
of the event, is non-partisan,
event moderator Quinn Strassel
announced the group's support
for Mark Schauer, the Demo-
cratic opponent to Rick Snyder
in the upcoming gubernatorial
election.
Irwin, the state representa-
tive, castigated Republican legis-
lators in the state for the decline
of its public schools. Many Dem-
ocrats, including Mark Schauer,
the Democratic candidate for
governor, have criticized Snyder
for presiding over massive cuts
in education funding.
Though Snyder increased
funding for education in the fis-
cal year 2015 budget plan and
has increased state funding for
K-12 schools over the course of
his tenure, classrooms have been
receivingless money, largely due
to lapses in federal stimulus
money.
According to an analysis by
The Detroit Free Press, state
funding for K-12 education in
2011 - the final budget submit-
ted by former Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm - was $10.7 billion. In
fiscal year 2014, Snyder called
for an $11.4 billion state alloca-
tion to K-12 education.
However, many Democrats
have criticized the Snyder
administration for failing to
compensate for the loss of fed-
eral stimulus money.
Irwin criticized the state's
move to privatize public school-

ing, saying charter schools are
proven to perform worse than
public schools. Many Republi-
cans have advocated expand-
ing charter school options as a
method for improving education
in the state.
Irwin called on voters to
"take back the house" by elect-
ing Democratic representatives
to the legislature.
Brown, too, faulted Republi-
cans for decreasing education
funding and channeling funds to
allow corporate tax breaks.
She outlined some of the
points in Schauer's education
plan, which includes standard-
izing class sizes and eliminating
budget cuts.
She also encouraged protest-
ers to take to the streets and
social media to encourage more
people to vote in the upcoming
election.
"This is about giving every
child in Michigan a world-class
education and bringing a bright-
er future for all of our kids," she
said.

New financial
resources, mentoring
rolled out for 2014
ByMICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Ross School of Business
and the College of Engineering
unveiled their newest entre-
preneurship venture, the Desai
Family Accelerator, on Aug. 19.
The program aims to do more
than incubate student start-
ups, like many current Univer-
sity programs do. Instead, it will
seek to advance projects during
their early stages. The financial
resources and mentorship pro-
vided by the program are avail-
able to students, faculty and
external companies.

The Business School's Samuel
Zell & Robert Lurie Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies and the
College of Engineering's Center
of Entrepreneurship will man-
age the program together.
"This Accelerator is a great
example of two world class pro-
grams coming together," said
CFE Executive Director Tom
Frank ina statement. "Most suc-
cessful startups have multidisci-
plinary backgrounds."
The program will provide
financial resources, mentoring
by faculty and University alumni
and office space at Pillar Tech-
nology, a consulting firm located
in downtown Ann Arbor with a
focus on developing companies.
The investments in the program
will provide funding for entre-
preneurial ventures.
The Accelerator is sponsored

by the Desai Sethi Family Foun-
dation-founded by Business
alum Bharat Desai '81-and the
William Davidson Foundation.
Desai is also the co-founder of
IT company Syntel.
The latter institution, found-
ed by Business alum William
Davidson '47, is based at the
University and emphasizes eco-
nomic education and consulting
services.
Desai said in a statement the
Accelerator is a direct reflection
of the DS Family Foundation,
bringing together education and
entrepreneurship in "perfect
harmony."
"(T)his initiative will provide
a boost to the local entrepre-
neurial ecosystem and encour-
age the establishment of new
and innovative ventures in
Michigan," he said.

Israel calls on neighbors to help
rebuild Gaza and disarm Hamas

Fragile truce holds
after two months of
intense conflict
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
and several Arab countries
should work together to rebuild
the Gaza Strip while disarming
Hamas militants who rule the
territory, Israel's finance minis-
ter said Sunday.
The remarks by Yair Lapid
come almost a week after Israel
and Hamas militants reached a
truce after almost two months
of fighting that devastated parts
of Gaza.
"We need a regional confer-
ence, with the Egyptians, the
Saudis, the Gulf States," Lapid, a
memberofthe centristYeshAtid
party, told reporters in Jerusa-
lem. "That conference should

focus on one thing, ensuring the
rehabilitation takes place along-
side demilitarization," he said.
It is unclear how he foresaw
the group demilitarizing Gaza
as Hamas has vowed it will
never give up its weapons. Nor
was it clear how responsive
Arab countries, some of whom
like Saudi Arabia have no for-
mal ties with Israel, would be
to such a conference. Lapid did
not say if any countries had been
consulted about the idea.
"This is a stupid demand, and
no one among the Palestinian
people would agree to such a
thing ... our weapons are used
to defend our people, and this
right was granted by heaven
and human laws," said Mushir
al-Masri, a Hamas spokesman
in Gaza.
Hamas and other Gaza mili-
tants fired 4,591 rockets and

mortars at Israel during the
fighting. Israel's military says it
struck 5,226 "targets" in Gaza.
The two sides are set to hold
indirect talks in Egypt next
month on key disputes that
remain unresolved.
Meanwhile Sunday, Israel
announced the expropriation of
about 1,000 acres of West Bank
land in a step that could help
clear the way for construction of
a new Jewish settlement.
The Israeli military made the
announcement Sunday in accor-
dance with a government edict.
It said the directive was made at
the end of a military operation
in June that searched for three
Israeli teens who were abducted
and killed by Hamas militants.
The Hamas kidnapping and
murder of the teens sparked a
chain of events that led to the
50-day war.

'Sin City 2' bores

Frank Miller's latest
a lousy example of
film noir
By SEAN CZARNECKI
DailyArts Writer
I appreciate the right kind of
crazy in a person, and there is
plenty of crazy in "Sin City: A
Dame to Kill
For." The black- ("
and-white CGI
is gaudy, the Sin City: A
nudity is bra- Dame to
zen, the one-
liners pile on Kill For
and the gore AtQuality16
spills. It is loud
and tasteless, and Rave
but taste isn't Dimension
the point. It
is not elegant and never claims
to be. Absurdity means every-
thing in a neo-noir universe.
like this, where the ooker chins

stack as high as cities, chivalry
is punished, and the lines that
are drawn are always crossed.
Attitude is everything. Unfor-
tunately, Frank Miller's latest
dreamscape - however nasty,
however wicked - never reach-
es that same level of insanity its
predecessor had, which made it
an unqualified success.
"Sin City" was a novelty back in
2005 when it was released. Freed
from the normal boundaries of
taste, you got the sense Miller
was reveling in the opportunity
to adapt his characters for the big
screen, with co-director Robert
Rodriguez ("Machete Kills") add-
ing campy touches all his own.
The stylized CGI visual palette
of high contrast black-and-white,
coupled with unapologetic vio-
lence and sexuality, appealed to
our fascination with crime. Beni-
cio Del Toro's ("Guardians of the
* Galaxy") turn as the undead Jack-
ie Boy was inspired. Bruce Willis'
("G.I. Joe: Retaliation") self-naro-

dy of the grizzled cop he plays so
often earned smart laughter. But
you won't find such inspiration
in this installment. It would not
surprise me if we look back on "A
Dame to Kill For" as the end of an
era of this kind of visual style.
"A Dame to Kill For" is divided
up into four separate stories, each
of them about as good as the other,
and each following a single pro-
tagonist. Marv (Mickey Rourke,
"The Wrestler") is out killing frat
boys. Johnny (Joseph Gordon-
Levitt, "Don Jon") is an arrogant
card player who plays a risky game
against Sin City's most powerful
politician, Senator Roarke (Pow-
ers Boothe, TV's "Deadwood").
Dwight McCarthy (Josh Brolin,
"Men in Black 3") is a private
detective haunted by his past,
and drawn back hopelessly into
the schemes of his old lover Ava
Lord (Eva Green, "300: Rise of an
Empire"). And finally, Nancy Cal-
lahan (JessicaAlba, "Machete"), in
desnair.in the madness ofrevenee.

is out to kill Senator Roarke for the
untimely end ofthe man she loved,
John Hartigan (Willis).
Like the original, "A Dame to
Kill For" owes much of its appeal
to its ensemble cast. You get the
sense this movie is a costume
party and its actors come dressed
"to the nines." Christopher Lloyd
(yeah, dude, like Doc Brown from
"Back to the Future") makes a
cameo as a doctor who shoots up
heroin before every operation. (It's
how he's got those steady hands.)
It's a brilliant high point of the
movie; if only there were more
moments like it, with that same
outrageous humor. The actors
seem to be having fun, but for all
the noise, it was repetitive and I
ended up just being bored. The
amnesia-prone Marv serves as a
convenient metaphor: lumbering,
ponderous, hungover, constantly
re-tracing his own steps.
My political awareness has
grown since I was thirteen,
when I first saw "Sin City" and
the "awesome" factor was all
that mattered. It's time now to
acknowledge the series' conflicts
with its treatment of women. I do
understand Rodriguez and Miller
are treating their subject matter
tongue-in-cheek and that they
narodv and follow the "evlni-

Like a Black Widow baby.
tation" tradition of the '70s and
'80s - films like "I Spit on Your
Grave." I understand also they
wanted to create capable women
that are dangerous, who weap-
onize their sexuality and pun-
ish lechery. These are women
who like sex. They are confident
in their bodies. Still, at the same
time these women empower
themselves, they are limited.
While Miller and Rodriguez
play with male gaze, they want
to titillate their audience with
these women's bodies. They avoid
some sexisms and fall hopelessly
into others. In short, they want
to have their cake and to eat it,
too. We have to think about that
contradiction. This is not en ccn-

demn nor defend the series. This
is just to think about that conflict,
because of how important it is in
today's culture.
The death of Lauren Bacall,
who starred alongside Hum-
phrey Bogart, throws the influ-
ence of film noir into sharp relief.
Haven't we all wanted to sit smug
as hell in a wreath of cigarette
smoke, in the slants of light com-
ing through the window shades?
Can't we brood in the shadows?
If only to put our noir "hats" back
on, "A Dame to Kill For" might be
worth the trip. For me, thinking
backonhowgoodtheoriginal"Sin
City" was, and how lousy this one
is as an example of noir - it's just
denressinz.

FYF: Growing pains and rising bands

California festival
celebrates its eleventh
year running
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily Arts Writer
Until this weekend, I had never
been to a music festival that's
younger than I am. Then I was
introduced to FYF, the baby of the
festival world.
At just 11 years old, FYF is char-
acterized in part by similar mud-
dled uncertainties and growing
pains that plague the pre-teens of
this generation. And at only two
days, it has yet to grow quite as
much as more senior festivals. But,
like the 11-year-old kid everyone
hopes to have, FYF is smart, ambi-
tious and eager to learn and please.
Before the festival really got
going on Saturday afternoon,
everyone had just about had it with
its disorganization. People waited
up to two hoursto pass the security
checkpoints, a sign that this youn-
gin' didn't know exactly what it
was getting into with its increased
popularity and larger venue.
FYF started in 2004 with just
one day of shows in a few rooms of
L.A.'s The Echo (before it was The
EchoPlex). By2009, after tryingits
hand at two and three day events,
FYF went back to one day and
moved to the L.A. State Historic
Park with the fanatical, outland-
ish and downrightcout of this world
amazing Black Lips headlining,
making me wonder why I didn't
know about it then ... I guess I was
too young.
As of 2012, the festival seems to
have settled on two days, but this
was its first year at the L.A. Sports
Arena and Exposition Park. Fortu-
nately,.lines had cleared by about
5:00 p.m. and organizers responsi-
bly sent out an apology notification
the next day, plus an apology email
about a week after the festival.
But then there was the matter

of actually seeing the performers.
Our plan was to start with Chet
Faker in The Arena, but it was at
capacity before he even went on. I'd
never experienced an indoor stage
at a festival and was excited to try it
out, but unfortunately never made
it in. Instead of waiting around to
see if we could squeeze in later on
to catch Caribou or DJ Harvey,
we turned to Albert Hammond
Jr. - known to me as a vital mem-
ber of The Strokes, who headlined
the whole festival - in his smart
starry button-up and burgundy
pants, to cheer us up. We made it to
the main stage in time for his last
song and a reminder that we'd see
him tomorrow with Julianand Fab
and the whole gang, rightwhere he
belongs.
Isay"where he belongs"because
while I think it's great that mem-
bers of The Strokes have developed
as solo artists for their own sake, I
still wish they would have toured
Comedown Machine for my sake.
Eventhoughthealbumitselfwasn't
mind blowing, at least I could have
seen them together. And I wish
they would keep making that for-
every-occasion-to-make-it-the-
most-special-of-occasions music
together like they used to. That
was the music that I grew up with,
guiding me through the horrors of
adolescence, falling asleep to when
nothing else could clear my head.
I had high hopes for them before
the novelty of their 2011 album
Angles had begun to wear off, but
that eventually turned into nostal-
gia when Comedown Machine was
released in 2013 - sans tour-- con-
firming that they would never be
the same band thatcreatedthe gem
that is isThisItagain.
But, I digress. The rest of Satur-
day was a world of discovery: see-
ing Little Dragon, Slowdive, Tycho
and Interpol for the first time was
fantastic individually and enliven-
ing as a whole. FYF may be a slight-
ly scatterbrained 11-year-old, but
an 11-year-old that knows where
it's at when it comes to curating

a lineup. Little Dragon is a rather
little-known band with a magical
lead singer who should be more
popular than she is (and likely
will be soon). She has the endear-
ing stage presence of Taylor Swift
minus the constant boy drama, and
a unique sense ofstyle thatcontrib-
utes to her overall charm.
Performing in L.A. for the first
time in 20years, Slowdive certain-
ly attracted tried-and-true fans
that were excited by its appear-
ance. Lead singer Rachel Goswell's
"I'm in an indie band and trying to
appear angelic" expression mostly
translated into a boring look, but
nevertheless they sounded great
and a rousing drum solo to close
the set left fans elated. Scott Han-
sen of Tycho and his bandmates
looked wonderfully comfortable
on stage together, so much so that
I had the sense we as the audience
were almost intruding on a private
practice. They pulled off their set
with flying colors, enhanced by
a beautiful impromptu visual set
that included short clips of surfers
just doing their thing among stun-
ningscenery.
Once Phoenix took the stage
to close the day, everybody really
seemed to wake up. Kicking off
with "Entertainment" immedi-
ately got everyone singing along.
And when they got to "Lisztoma-
nia" a few songs in, almost every-
one screeched like star-struck
tweens. People seemed inspired to
let their goofiness show. Thanks
to the group of girls surrounding
me, however, I realized I must not
be the Phoenix fan I thought I was.
While they recited every lyric like
life-giving anthems, I was stand-
ing there relieved when "Trying
To Be Cool" finally came on and I
could actually join in. Phoenix is
definitely one of those bands that
sound just as perfect live as they do
recorded, a major reason I enjoyed
them so much despite not always
being able to sing along. Plus, you
really get a sense of their unique-
ness watching them perform that

just isn't accessible in a recording.
Instead of making an all-day
event out of Sunday as well, I slept
late and rolled into FYF as the sun
was going down, just as Built to
Spill was closing their set. I was
instantly drawn into their song and
I was sad that the one I heard was
the last. For the rest of the evening,
the band came up in many attend-
ees' listofbestperformances.
The first artist I actually saw
was rapper Earl Sweatshirt. I felt
especially accomplished when I
discovered that he graduated from
a nearby LA high school at the same
time I did. But all kidding aside, he
maintained an essence of matu-
rity despite beingarelativelyyoung
artist. "Chum," arguably one of his
most popular songs, deals with
identity issues and tense parental
relations, which really seemed to
speak to everyone in the audience.
Earl definitely knows how to put
on a show while mixing in deeper
messages.
Later on, Haim took the main
stage for the kind of jam session
usually only found athouse parties.
In fact, one of the sisters told the
crowd stories of the "epic" celebra-
tions they used to throw as high
schoolers living in the Valley. I've
been listening to Haim a lot lately,
and find their songs take on a much
different feeling recorded versus
live. On Spotify, the music is nice
and crisp. You can even listen to
them having a perfectly polite con-
versation about the making of their
album Days Are Gone. But live,
Haim is loud, raw and full of solos
and anecdotes that make the whole
experience incredibly lively. The
girls are an absolute joy to watch
together; you can tell they're used
to working with each other's styles,
which makes the music flow that
much easier. Then, the band ended
with a shout out to the weekend's
headliner, and allhell broke loose.
Judging by the sheer number
of band t-shirts that could be seen
throughout the weekend, it's safe
to say that there was no lack of love

for The Strokes. I felt this love first-
hand when thousands of people
literally charged forward, sweep-
ing me up ina human stream mov-
ing straight for the stage. In classic
rockstar fashion, they came on
about 40 minutes late (very possi-
bly because Julian was still sober-
ing up), giving me time to reflect
on the anxiety I had been feeling
about seeing them. Questions like
"What if they don't sound the same
as they used to?" and "What if they
only play songs from Comedown
Machine?" plagued my mind for
days leadingup to the festival. That
anxiety started melting away when
Julian, with his greasy/shaggy
hair and I-don't-give-a-fuck strut
started singing "Barely Legal." The
set continued with "Welcome to
Japan" and "Automatic Stop," and
I realized I had nothing to worry
about.
They knew what we wanted,
and they were going to give it to
us. Their ultra-clear and often poi-
gnantlyricsunfortunatelyinspired
many tone deaf but die hard fans to
belt along with them. After a bit of
shuffling I found a relatively quite
place to watch, but I had to won-
der ... when did The Strokes start
attracting such intensely vocal
fans? Maybe it has something
to do with how Julian sings. Not
just his voice, but the way he
leans forward and squeezes the
microphone, like he's working
really hard to get everyone to
understand (it worked). Maybe
it's how he addresses the crowd
but then decides he doesn't want
to talk, simply saying "I love you
guys." Well Jules, we love you
too.
But I came to a realization
throughout their performance:
I no longer love them the same
way I did when I was sixteen. I
don't need them as much any-'
more. 1251 was the code on my
phone for the longest time, and
I even toyed with the idea of
including lyrics to "Someday"
on my personal yearbook page,

but all the words I wanted to
use wouldn't fit. Working my
way through any given album
of theirs used to make me feel
progressively better after a shit
day. Now, their songs coming
up on shuffle is more like a sur-
prise visit from an old friend:
lovely, but not the same. Seeing
them live is almost the same
thing. It's a great time and it's
liberating as ever and it makes
you feel the way you want to
feel all the time. Not to mention
that there's such a novelty to it.
The Strokes don't just perform
with the frequency of any other
touring artists. But they're not
touring artists, and I'm not 16
anymore. They were amazing
just like they always are and I'll
love them like I always have, but
I have to start coming to terms
with the idea that they very well
may never be the same band
who created Is This It again.
FYF was a weekend of explo-
ration, and it was a weekend
of growth. I saw a lot of bands
I hadn't seen or hadn't heard
before, and as you read, I saw
one I have a whole lot of feelings
for. Before going to FYF, I sort
of just saw it as something dif-
ferent to do for a weekend and
noticed that a lot of the crowd
used it as a temporary alter-
native make-out location. But
besides being a reason for Ange-
lenos to use public transporta-
tion (there's a metro stop just
outside the venue) or an excuse
for girls to wear either wine bras
or no bra at all, it's a wonderful
way to step away from main-
stream music to find out where
all those Top 100 hits start,
and why. The amount of talent
and potential at FYF is hard to
overestimate, and I'd bet money
that some of those little-known
bands playing at noon on Sat-
urday will be closing shows in
a few years, singing to swarms

But like seasons six and seven,
the finale's final act delivered. In
the end, when Sookie chooses
to remain a faerie, she chooses
to finally accept who she is. She
chooses herself. And just like
that, "True Blood" roared back.
Like "Six Feet Under," Alan
Ball's other HBO series, "True
Blood" wisely chose satisfaction
over spectacle, as we were given
a peek into the futures of every
character - Eric and Pam run-

about everybody else coupled

never know, but that isn't really
the point.)
In its final hour, "True Blood"
was something it never was -
safe. But while "safe" would have
been a deal-breaker for a season
finale, it made for a surprisingly
sweet series ender.
Of course, many will remem-
ber the final scene between Sook-
ie and Bill, in which together the
pair stake Bill, dousing Sookie
one lasttime in vampire guts. The
scene is classically "True Blood,"
and incited the reel of similarly
classic scenes that is currently
playing through my mind like a
greatest hits album - its fantastic
series premiere, Sookie running

time, Godric's death, Pam turning

Eric fever dream threesome.
Was "True Blood" perfect? Of
course not. It never quite knew
what to do with Lafayette, it
spent an excessive amount of
time focused on werewolf cul-
ture and there was a season five
Iraq war/smoke monster story-
line that is just as bad as it sounds.
But all told, I will always have
a special place in my heart for
"True Blood." As the finale fast-
forwarded through years of the
character's lives, I couldn't help
but think about my own - about
how fast time goes, about the past
seven years and about the people
I've experienced "True Blood"
with. If it sounds like I'm giving

too much weight to a series that
at one point had a secret faerie
nightclub storyline, I probably
am. Or maybe it was the episode's
Thanksgiving-set ending. Or its
title, simply "Thank You." But
in those closing moments, I was
thankful. I was thankful for this
silly, scary, quirky, sometimes-
poignant, always-entertaining
comic book of a show that didn't
give a shit about what it was or
who it was. It was just itself.
So with that, I raise a glass of

Five Things We Learned: App. State

Appalachian
State an inferior
opponent, but
plenty to observe
By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
Entering Michigan football's
season opener against
Appalachian State, there were
numerous questions about how
it would respond to last year's
mediocre 7-6 season. With new
offensive coordinator Doug
Nussmeier making his debut,
the offensive was a mystery.
Though Michigan likely
didn't display the full breadth
of its offense in the 52-14 rout of
the Mountaineers, some things
can be gleaned about the team
from the victory.
1. Devin to Devin is the next
big thing:
It started on Michigan's first
offensive play, an 11-yard screen
pass from fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
to junior wide receiver Devin
Funchess. The chemistry
between Gardner and Funchess
was evident throughout the
entire first half.
The duo combined for
seven receptions - three of
which were touchdowns -
and 95 yards in the half. The
Mountaineers had no match
defensively for Funchess,
perhaps best displayed on his
third touchdown catch. Gardner
threw the pass to the back of the
end zone, where Funchess made
the catch over the outstretched
arms of defenders.
Wherever Gardner threw the
ball, Funchess caught it. The
pair cited improved chemistry
and extra work in the offseason
as the key to their success.

season, Michigan's offensive
line was the team's biggest
question mark going into the
season. The line got the job done
in the season opener, but how it
will look in the future is unclear.
Fifth-year senior Joey
Burzynski started at right
guard, but was relieved by
redshirt sophomore Kyle Kalis
in the first half. The offensive
line was more effective once
Kalis was inserted. Hoke said
Monday that he doesn't yet
know who will play the position
in the next game, but that he had
a plan. He didn't care to divulge
that plan to the media.
There is a similar conundrum
at the center position. Redshirt
junior Jack Miller started and
played the entire time the
starters did. But redshirt junior
Graham Glasgow returns from
suspension for the Notre Dame
game, putting the position
in flux. Glasgow started nine
games at center in 2013 while
Miller started four.
Once again, Hoke said he has a
plan for incorporating Glasgow,
but didn't want to share how or
if he will incorporate Glasgow
with the media.

F b M r r s LLpU/naiy
Devin Funchess become the first Michigan receiver to record three touchdowo passes inoa season opener, doint all the damage in the first halt on Saturday.

Last season, graduated wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon was
Gardner's favorite target. It
appears the role has transferred
to Funchess, the converted tight
end, this season.
2. Norfleet will finally be a
regular part of the offense:
For two years, junior slot
receiver Dennis Norfleet has
displayed tantalizing shiftiness
and speed for Michigan as a
punt and kick returner. He
appeared sparingly on offense,
though usually in specialized
packages and formations.
Norfleet was listed as the
team's starting slot wide
receiver before the season,
but it was unclear how he'd be
used. Saturday, Norfleet was

Daily Sports Editor
It doesn't take much to make
Michigan quarterback Devin
Gardner happy.
Against NOTEB
Appalachian 00K
State, it was
first-year offensive coordinator
Doug Nussmeier's presence on
the sideline that put a smile on
Gardner's face and was one of
the first things the fifth-year
senior mentioned after the
game.
"With Doug being on the
sideline I think it helps with
situations because (he was)
able to talk to (Gardner)
between series and make some
adjustments," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke Saturday.
Hoke later added Monday:
"With the whole offense, I
think it's important. I've said it
before, for Devin, (and) it being
their first year together. I think
overall, their communication
and the communication with
everybody else was positive."
Nussmeier was animated
on the sidelines - to the point
where Hoke had to pull him back
and make sure he didn't wander
onto the middle of the field.
His active style contrasts with
former offensive coordinator
Al Borges, who conducted the
offense from the booth. And
everyone is adjusting - and
benefitting - from the change.
"Having coach Nuss on the
sideline was great too, because
he got to really sit down and
explain on the white board to
us and fix it, instead of being
up in the press box and talking
to us through the headset,"
said junior wide receiver Devin
Funchess.
Funchess, in particular,
benefited from Nussmeier on
the field as he exploded for
three touchdowns and 95 yards
in three quarters of play.

ManagingSports Editor
Junior Devin Funchess is
Michigan football's newest No.
1, a uniform number given to an
exclusive group of Wolverines
wide receivers.
On Saturday against
Appalachian State, Funchess
lived up to his new designation,
hauling in three touchdown
passes and seven receptions
total for 95 yards.
In the process, he became the
first Michigan receiver in the
program's 135-year history ever
to catch three scores in a season
opener.
And Monday, senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
offered his opinion on Funchess'
talent and potential.
"He can probably be the
best receiver to ever play
here," Gardner said at his press
conference.
One reoorter replied,

"That's a pretty big statement,"
to which the quarterback
asserted, "Yeah, it is."
Michigan has fielded a slew of
talented receivers, from Braylon
Edwards - the last to wear No.
1 - to Heisman Trophy winner
Desmond Howard, to single-
season receiving yards leader
Jeremy Gallon.
Following Gallon's
graduation, Funchess has
become Gardner's top target.
Saturday's performance was his
first three-TD game.
Funchess' combination of
his 6-foot-5 frame, soft hands,
speed and power make him a
force to be reckoned with, one
that Appalachian State coach
Scott Satterfield said would
create matchup issues for every
team in the nation.
And if Gardner's prediction is
correct, Funchess will become
another household name
joining the list of greats who
have worn No.1.

defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison and Nussmeier
pointed to their respective
starting freshmen as poised
in their first college football
games.
Mason Cole, the first true
freshman to start at left tackle
in program history, struggled
on a couple plays, most notably
giving up a sack in the second
quarter. But save for a few plays,
Cole looked like a seasoned
veteran and generated praise
from his coaches.
"I thought Mason did a
nice job," Nussmeier said.
"Nothing's too big for him. He's
a young player and we knew
going into the game there would
be some things that happened,
and obviously the one sack that
occurred, but its not about the
sack, it's about how you react
to it
"I thought he did an
outstanding job, very focused
very level-headed, (he) played a
great football game."
Meanwhile, prized freshman
cornerback Jabrill Peppers

played in several defensive
series as the nickel corner
and also appeared as a punt
returner. An ankle injury kept
him in the locker room in the
second half, but he did enough
to impress Mattison.
"It wasn't too big for
(Peppers)," Mattison said. "I
was very impressed with that
part of it. If you watched him
early and pregame and how
he acts, and all that, he was
just like I thought he'd be. The
couple of tackles he made that's
what I thought I would see ...
He's going to bring it."
Peppers ended the game with
two tackles and had one punt
return for six yards.
ABSENTEES: Everyone can
breathe easy, Peppers should be
able to play Saturday. Following
the game, Hoke said Peppers
will be ready, but retracted a bit
Monday after he sat out practice
Sunday.
"He's been in here allmorning
getting treatment (and) he's
working hard to get better,"

Hoke said. "I don't think he'll
be a question mark, I think he'll
be ready to play."
Sophomore safety Delano
Hill, who broke his jaw in camp,
is also set to go for Saturday,
according to Hoke. He'll join
a young crop of safeties that
includes junior Jarrod Wilson
andthreesophomoresinJeremy
Clark, Dymonte Thomas and AJ
Pearson.
Meanwhile, offensive
lineman Graham Glasgow is
returning from his one-game
suspension for operating a
vehicle while visually impaired.
Hoke didn't give much
insight into his plans for
introducing Glasgow back into
the line rotation repeating, "we
have a plan."
Glasgow is also glaringly
absent from the depth chart,
but a week of work in practice
could shuffle things around.

Louro has been on different

Grinwis, who has played more

figured as the starter coming

contest the spot, just as he didn't

Daley said the two keepers

we also played two very different

to tell in my opinion, because we
were much more prepared and
focused as a collective group (on
Sunday) than we were Friday."
The Wolverines play one game
each of the next three weekends,
so with splitting the contests
not an option, perhaps a starter
will emerge. At the very least
for Louro, he's learning from
Grinwis in his first season.
"I learned a lot from Adam
because he's a senior and he's
been around the block," Louro
said. "(Assistant coach Jhojan
Obando) has been working with
both of us, and it's good to get
that competitiveness in training.
But at the end of the day, whoever
coach chooses to go out, we know
they're going to do a good job."
After two strong defensive
performances on the weekend,
the competition is just that - a
competition.
But Louro showed with his
play Sunday that he won't back
down from anything.

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
The West Coast has held a
hex over the Michigan women's
soccer team for most of coach
Greg Ryan's tenure - and
it continued to plague the
Wolverines this weekend.
For the first time since
2011, the
Wolverines MICHIGAN 0
(2-2) were SAN DIEGO 5
shut out
in back- MICHIGAN 0
to-back S.D. STATE 3,
matches.
Friday, San Diego dealt Michigan
its first loss of the season in a
5-0 onslaught. The Wolverines
couldn't rebound Sunday, when
they were blanked 3-0 by San
Diego State.
"I don't think it's tough to
respond to losses like these,"
Ryan said. "We hit our bottom
against San Diego, and I don't
think we'll play that poorly again
this year. ... Friday, we didn't
represent Michigan. We didn't
represent anybody."
Michigan's downfall stemmed
from an inefficient offense,
which has struggled to finish
its chances early in the season.
But this weekend, it fought to
even create those opportunities.
After taking 37 shots in their
opening homestand last week,
the Wolverines mustered just
four shots on goal in California.
"Coming onto the road,
you're in completely different
circumstances, and this is such
a young team," said junior
midfielder Corinne Harris. "We
were put in a situation where
we're not as comfortable, and it
affected us."
Friday night against San
Diego, Michigan gave up its first
goal of the season just three
minutes into the match off a
crossed ball. The Toreros (1-2-1)
continued to take advantage of
what Ryan called a "lack ofeffort"
and rampant disorganization,
notching two more goals before
the end of the half.
Sophomore goalkeeper Taylor

Bucklin made only one save in
the first half and was taken out
for the second half. Freshman
Megan Hinz and junior Maddie
Clarfield shared time in the net,
but each gave up anothergoal.
"That was really the first time
we gotoverwhelmed right away,"
Harris said. "Their intensity was
so high, and we didn't come out
ready to meet that.... We'll never
let that happen again."
In Sunday's game, San Diego
State (2-1-1) outshot Michigan
19-8 and put 13 shots on goal.
It took 11 minutes for Harris to
take Michigan's first shot, but
according to her, she felt the
team had good possessions and
created high quality scoring
opportunities. Harris took
half the team's shots but was
unsuccessful in getting one past
the keeper.
"Corinne has had a fantastic
start," Ryan said, "but the one
thing she has to do is score
goals. She's getting chances,
and I'm really proud of how
she's played, but at the end of
the day, she's got to put the ball
in the back of the net."
Nearing the end of the first

half, Aztec forward Meggie
Gulczynski scored on a free
kick that flew above the hands
of Bucklin. Adding insult to
injury, in the final 30 seconds,
sophomore midfielder Anna
Soccorsi accidentally headed the
ball into Michigan's goal.
With San Diego State sitting
comfortably with a two-goal
lead, Hinz replaced Bucklin,
who had made eight saves
in the first half. In the 87th
minute, the Aztecs collected a
rebound off a corner kick and
knocked it passed Hinz from
three yards out.
"The only chances that went
in for San Diego State were not
good chances," Ryan said. "They
were silly goals: an own goal, a
ball that's easily savable and a
late corner kick when I have all
the subs in."
Last year's Wolverines, who
reached the Elite Eight, never
suffered a weekend like this.
This year's team, which Ryan
said can't be compared to its
predecessor, has the same goals
for the 2014 season.
But there's still a long way to

The best damn team on this campus

DEXTER, Mich. - The
best team on campus
sets up a locker room
at two picnic
tables under
a gazebo.
There are no
showers or
expensive
training
rooms. You
probably GREG
haven't or
won't see GARNO
their home
course.
The coach of the best team on
campus rides his bike while he
works. He wears a windbreaker
with a ball cap, but you
wouldn't recognize his face.
His best runners are just over
five feet. You probably wouldn't
think twice if they walked past
you on the Diag.
The best team on campus
is ranked first in the nation
and could win its first national
championship in program
history. But you might have
gone the rest of the year
without ever knowing a thing
about them.
And they wouldn't care.
Because the best team on this
campus has never been in the
spotlight. And it won't act any
differently now that it is.
The Michigan women's
cross country team, after all,
isn't a team that brings in TV
money or draws large fan bases.
Cross country itself has never
attracted attention, because
why would anyone want to
watch a three-mile race when
they could watch people hitting
each other?
Most often, fans watch
runners go by for a fleeting
moment, and then silence. In
the Wolverines' only home meet
of the season - albeit, more a
scrimmage than invitational -
the men's and women's teams
might have collectively drawn
about 100 people. Most of them
were parents.

it also helps Kings of Cross
that it returns
its top-10 NCAA Rankings
runners after
fnsng 1. M ich igan

season. And 5. Georgetown

23rd season 7. Arkansas
who has led 8. Colorado
his team to 9. Iowa State
five top-six 10. Virginia
finishes and
three straight
regional titles in the last
decade.
Coaches took note, and
voted them as the No. 1 team
in the nation - the first time in
program history.
But you can probably guess
how they reacted to that
distinction.
"It's pretty cool, but rankings
don't mean much," Osika said.
"Once we start racing, actions
speak louder than words."
Added McGuire: "It's
a prognostication, not a
coronation. They know there's
work to be done."
Or senior captain Brooke
Handler: "We just talk about
trying to follow the process
and do everything we can to
get where we need to be in
November."
This team may not win the
national championship this
year, and that's OK, because
they'll come back next year to
go through the same process.
And you likely won't pay
attention to them next year.
But this year, if only for this
season, know that the best team
on this campus is running by,
and their coach is following on
his bike.
Garno would love to talk
about his own cross country
career at ggarno@umich.edu or
on Twitter: @.GGarno. And of
course, if you're looking to follow
the women's cross country team,
the Daily will have coverage.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
The Michigan women's cross country team is ranked No.1 in the country, yet few people follow their season. Garno sheds some light on the upstart program.

They won't have an
opportunity to run out in front
of 100,000 fans screaming with
the marching band playing, nor
will they have to worry about
their reaction after a bad race.
But they do hug their parents,
find friends and laugh with
teammates after the race.
There won't be interviews
from ESPN on camera or a
feature writer from Sports
Illustrated asking about their
life history.
There won't even be the
pressure of winning the next
race because almost all races
are non-scoring until the end of
the season.
That won't make a difference,
because the best team on
campus knows nothing else.
Instead, they know how to
run fast and what it takes to

win.
"It's just attention to detail,"
said coach Mike McGuire.
"Acting on what we're talking
about. It's
easy to
want to be
good. The The c
tough part
is actually the be

than just h sbike

So McGuire's team runs its
first meet of the season against
itself even if there are no fans,

behind her until she eventually

There were no lines of fans
along the finish line, and Finn

didn't hear the crowd pointing
out Osika closing on her.
When Finn did recognize her
competition, the pair met stride
for stride to an actual photo
finish. Neither girl knew Osika
won, though. They hadn't seen
results after their race. They
cooled down with everyone else
in the next step toward winning
the national championship.
"Each of them can make
the other one better, and they
all have strengths that others
can feed off of," McGuire
said. "The big thing is that
they get along really well. We
have a good balance between

These are the things that

Intrasquad meetcompetitive

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
DEXTER, Mich. - First-year
Michigan coach Kevin Sullivan
made it clear to his runners
before Friday's Michigan Open
that he didn't want them to push
the pace.
For the 22nd-ranked Wolver-
ines men's cross country team,
the sole home event of the season
represented little more than a
tuneup and a convenient setting
to get used to pre-race jitters.
But sometimes, boys will be
boys.
In the final meters of the non-
scoring, intrasquad 5K, junior
standout Tony Smoragiewicz
was clear of the pack and being
cheered toward the finish line,
but fellow junior Mason Ferlic
was closing fast. Smoragiewicz,
not to be surpassed, used his best
box-out maneuver to keep Ferlic
at bay to barely pull off the win.
Smoragiewicz, who competed
as anunattached runner, finished
in 15:19.8, just eight-tenths of a
second ahead of his teammate.
Ferlic, a first-team All-Amer-
ican in 2013, couldn't contain a
smile when he talked about get-
ting edged out of first place.
"(Smoragiewicz) wanted to

win there at the end," Ferlic said,
"but it was all in good sport. We
were trying to tell each other,
'Don't race at the very end.' It was
supposed to be a workout. Obvi-
ously, though, it's just fun to be
competitive."
The rest of the meet was some-
what uneventful as the team
stuck to Sullivan's advice, chug-
ging toward the finish line in a
large pack for much of the race.
The upcoming season, though,
should provide plenty of fire-
works. The drama started in the
spring when, after second- and
third-place finishes in the Big
Ten the past two seasons, former
coach Alex Gibbs was released.
The decision reflected the
Wolverines' poor performance
in distance track and field events,
but it still seemed to take some
runners aback.
"It was a tough change for me
before I got to know (Sullivan),"
said redshirt junior August
Pappas. "I was pretty close with
myoldcoach,soitwasn'teasy.But
I've been really impressed with
how smoothly everything has
gone, how calm and composed
coach Sullivan has been with
the change. He's impressed, I
think, all of us with his level of
professionalism and focus."

Added Ferlic: "It's been a
smooth transition. Obviously, a
lot of the guys really liked coach
Gibby, and it was a little rough at
the beginning, but coach Sullivan
has been great. He really took the
time to learn us as a team."
Sullivan, a former standout
distance runner for Michigan,
now has the challenge of
equaling past success in cross
country while delivering better
results in the spring season. That
task comes with the additional
hurdles of coaching a team with
little championship experience
and only one senior.
Friday,. the Wolverines did
see a promising performance
from redshirt freshman Austin
Baumgarten, who finished the
race in fourth with a time of
15:24, but the competition for
roster spots is still thick and the
clock is ticking.
"I'didn't want (the Michigan
Open) to turn into a race where
guys were racing for spots nine
through 12," Sullivansaid. "We're
going let the next few weeks play
out and determine who are our
fittest guys."
And Sullivan returned to
solving that puzzle immediately
following the finish, lining the
teamup for post-race sprints.

Junior Shannon Osika has won three consecutive Michigan Opens, capped by Friday's win over teammaterio Finn.
Osika claims Mich. Open

By JAKE LOURIM
DailySportsEditor
As far as competitions go,
Friday's Michigan Open was
little more than a tune-up for
the No. 1 women's cross country
team.
"It's easier to get competitive
with a red shirt or a green
shirt than it is with my own
teammates," said senior captain
Brook Handler.
But the Wolverines looked
just fine competing against their
own maize shirts.
Junior Shannon Osika and
sophomore Erin Finn took each
other right down to the wire,
finishing with identical times
of 17:01.5. One final push put
Osika past the finish line a split
second sooner, giving her a third
straight Michigan Open title.
Finn had the slimmest of
leads for most of the race, but
Osika pushed her the whole way
after the two broke away from
the pack.
"We don't really look at it
like competition," Osika said.
"Nobody's trying to beat each
other on the team, it's more just
pulling each other along. It's
nice to have that motivation."
Handler said the plan going

into the race was to stay together
as a team for the first mile.
Almost all of the 29 Wolverines
competing did that, and then
the top runners separated
themselves.
Handler finished 34 seconds
behind the leaders - an
uncharacteristically large deficit
for Handler, according to coach
Mike McGuire. According
to McGuire, Osika, Finn and
Handler formed the team's
lead pack at camp, which ended
Thursday.
"Each of them can make the
otheronebetter,andtheyallhave
strengths that others can feed
off of," McGuire said. "The big
thing is that they get along really
well. We have a good balance
between being competitive and
being harmonious."
Fifth-year senior Taylor
Pogue and redshirt junior Anna
Pasternak followed the top
three with times of 17:45.4 and
17:51.9, respectively. Just over 50
seconds separated the top five
runners, a time McGuire said he
would like to trim down to 40
seconds over 6K.
Nineteen of 32 runners were
Wolverines, including the top
10 finishers. The rest were
unattached.

While McGuire hopes to
improve the depth from Friday's
meet, he also wants to maintain
Finn, Osika and Handler as
three of the nation's best. The
trio finished 30th, 56th and
64th, respectively at the NCAA
Championships last year, helping
the team to a fourth-place finish
nationally.
Junior Taylor Manett,
another returner from lastyear's
squad, was 57th at the NCAA
Championships.
The returning talent earned
the Wolverines a preseason No. 1
rankingthis year.
"The ranking is calling a lot of
attention," McGuire said. "We
have more depth than we've had
in the last couple years, but you
get to the national meet, front
running is important. We feel
we're starting to develop front
runners."
Though the No. 1 ranking
is Michigan's first in program
history, the team is slow to bring
it up early in the season.
Whether they acknowledge it
or not, the Wolverines have one
of the best returning contingents
in the nation.
And as Osika and Finn proved
Friday, they'll be pushing each
other every step of the way.

Tony Smoragiewicz pulled off a win in the Michigan Open, boxing out Mason Ferlic to claim the intrasquad event.

App State: The good, bad, ugly

Finally, 'M'can
begin to heal

By MAX COHEN and ALEXA
DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editors
Each week, the Michigan
Daily football beat will pick out
the good, the bad and the ugly
from Saturday's game.
The Good: After an offseason
full of questions about Michigan's
offensive line, the unit responded
in the season opener, creating
holes that allowed Wolverines'
rushers to gain 350 yards on the
ground. The much-maligned unit
allowed just one sack of fifth-
year senior quarterback Devin
Gardner, who completed 13-of-14
pass attempts for 173 yards and
three touchdowns.
Junior wide receiver Devin
Funchess was unstoppable in
the first half, catching seven
passes for 95 yards and three
touchdowns. Appalachian State
had little answer for Funchess'
size and it showed. Wherever
Gardner threw the ball, Funchess
caught it, defenders be damned.
Defensively, Michigan
shut down the Mountaineers,
allowing just 127 passing yards.
Even the Wolverine special
teams got involved in the
scoring when redshirt freshman
linebacker Mike McCray
blocked a punt which sophomore
linebacker Ben Gedeon returned
for a touchdown.
The Bad: Michigan coach

Brady Hoke was disappointed
by the lack of playmaking by his
defense. The Wolverines record-
ed only one sack and forced zero
turnovers. Though the lack of big
plays on defense was inconse-
quential because of the margin of
Michigan's victory, the Wolver-
ines will need more out of their
defense in future games.
Another cause for concern
was the ankle injury freshman
cornerback Jabrill Peppers
suffered in the first half.
Peppers made two tackles in his
Michigan debut and returned
one punt for six yards, but didn't
come out of the locker room for
the second half.
. 4k

Peppers showed a hint of his
elusiveness on the punt return,
but Wolverine fans wouldn't get
to see any more of the prized
prospect. Hoke said the removal
from the game was strictly
precautionary and he fully
expects Peppers to play against
Notre Dame.
The Ugly: After a strong
afternoon behind center for
Gardner, Shane Morris took the
reigns for the last series in the
third quarter. But it was ugly for
the sophomore.
On his second pass of the 2014
season Morris dropped back in
a play-action pass and threw it
down the rihe etsline for sonh-

omore wide receiver Amara Dar-
boh. Morris, locked down on the
receiver and the Mountaineers'
Dante Blackmon keyed in and
grabbed the interception on the
three-yard line.
Morris took the field for
just one more series, a seven-
minute drive that stalled on
the one-yard line and resulted
in an 18-yard field goal. The
second-string quarterback has
garnered offseason praise from
his coaches, but looked less than
promising against Appalachian
State's back ups.
Morris finished the game
3-for-5 with 37 yards and one
intercention

PAUL SHt
The Michigan football team dominated Appalachian State from start to finish, but there were some negatives.

Breaking down the football schedule

Ffinally.
At 9:41 a.m. Saturday
morning ESPN's College
GameDay did a feature on the
2007 Michigan-Appalachian
State game, a
34-32 Moun-
taineers win.
But by 12:30
that same
afternoon,
the city of
Ann Arbor
was finally
ready to ALEXA
move on. DETTELBACH
For the
last seven
years the name "Appalachian
State" has left Michigan fans
with their heads buried in their
hands. Now they can begin to
peek up. While no one will soon
forget 2007, it's finallytime to
move on. And it took less than
a quarter into the 2014 season
to begin the healing process of
quite possibly the biggest college
upset of all time.
Two precision passes from
quarterback
Devin Gardner
to Devin Funch-
ess, erased W hil(
memories will for
blocked kicks
from seven it' fin
years ago. And S
that was only to m
the first quarter.
The Devin-
to-Devin show
had fans on
their feet and creating new
memories of playingthis small
team from Boone, N.C.
Up to hours before kickoff
people criticized this matchup.
And nothing spoke volumes of
disinterest more than the crowd
34 minutes before the game. It
was full come kickoff, but it was
clear that fans were begrudg-
ingly coming to this one.
What do the Wolverines
have to gain by playing the
Mountaineers again? You'd
think the Athletic Department
would want to eradicate all
memory of 2007. And if they
win, it's because they were
supposed to, and if they don't?
Well, that's not important
anymore.
But everyone can agree that
by the time Funchess caught his
third touchdown, a ridiculous
over-the-helmet, back-of-the-
end-zone catch, there was
little to criticize and alot to
commend.
From start to finish things
were different from 2007. Last
time, Appalachian State blew
open the game with a 21-point
second quarter - this time it
was Michigan's turn at three
touchdowns before the half.
Last time, the Mountaineers

made stops on defense and the
momentum carried over. This
time, the Wolverines punted
once all game.
While it was nowhere near
the level of beingthe fifth-
ranked team in the nation,
Michigan still shined. The
first quarter and a half was the
Funchess show, but the rest
belonged to sophomore run-
ning back's Derrick Green and
De'Veon Smith who both topped
100-yards rushing.
"All offseason everybody's
been talking about how App
State came in here and beat you
all in 2007," said Appalachian
State coach Scott Satterfield.
"You dadgum right they were
determined. We knew that from
the minute our AD said we were
playing Michigan, so they've
been eager for this one - the
fans and the players - and they
played like it."
The new-look offense was
dynamic, racking up over 500-
yards and seven touchdowns,
and the revamped offensive
line looked
competent.
Michigan's
no one starting
. 2 defense held
'get 200, the Moun-
taineers to 19
lly tile yards pass-
ing in the
ove on. first half. But
those who
remember
2007 know
it was special teams that made
history.
So, going into the opener, it
was special teams that Michigan
coach Brady Hoke emphasized
and he resorted to showing his
team the infamous blocked kick
throughout camp as motivation.
"It definitely inspired us
on special teams," said senior
defensive end Frank Clark.
"When you show that all of
camp and you show it lead-
ing into the week, you have no
choice, but to go in there and do
what you've gotto do."
So, one missed 48-yard field
goal aside, the special teams
did their job and Michigan
helped put a Band-Aid on a long-
standing wound. 34-32 can now
say what it should've seven years
ago: 52-14.
No one will forget 2007; but
a dominant victory Saturday
begins a healing process seven
years in the making. And even
those fans that entered the sta-
dium skeptical in the morning
smiled because this elusive vic-
tory was finally had.
Finally.

Notre Dame: Once again,
Michigan is facing the Fighting
Irish under the lights, and this
season the rivals will match up in
South Bend. In the last scheduled
meeting between the two teams,
Notre Dame will be missing
key players due to academic
dishonesty.
Miami (Ohio): Michigan has
defeated the RedHawks in all five
of their meetings. The teams most
recently matched up in 2008 in
what was Rich Rodriguez's first
win as the Wolverines' coach.
Michigan struggled to put Miami
away until Brandon Minor ran
for the Wolverines' final score in
Michigan's 16-6 victory.
Utah: The Rich Rodriguez era
began against the Utes on Aug.
30, 2008. Utah took a 15-point
lead midway through the third
quarter and hung on, 25-23. The
close loss earned respect later
in the season as the Utes beat
Alabama in the Sugar Bowl and
finished as the country's only
undefeated team.
Minnesota: It's the oldest
trophy game. in FBS college
football, even if it's not very
competitive. The Wolverines

and Golden Gophers have
fought for the Little Brown Jug
since 1909, and Michigan holds
a commanding 73-24-3 series
lead. The jug was left behind
in Minnesota in 1903 after the
Gophers rallied for a late 6-6
tie. (Those were the only points
allowed by the Wolverines all
year.) The jug isn't little (it's
a five-gallon container) and
originally was white, not brown.
Rutgers: Despite boasting 280
years of college football between
them, the Scarlet Knights and
Wolverines have never met.
Rutgers hosted the first-ever
intercollegiate football game on
Nov. 6, 1869, against Princeton in
New Brunswick, New Jersey. The
Scarlet Knights won, 6-4, but lost
the rematch the following week.
Meanwhile, Michigan played its
first game 10 years later against
Racine in Chicago.
Penn State: Last season's
version of the matchup was
a four-overtime affair that
tested the health of everyone's
heart. Now, both teams return
for another matchup at night.
This time, the Wolverines take
on a squad with just 11 seniors
and new coach James Franklin
replacing Bill O'Brien. In the
third year of their sanctions, the

Nittany Lions are playing with
fewer scholarship players where
the offensive line has taken one
of the biggest hits. Penn State has
time to adjust, though, and the
team that shows up midseason
could be different than the one
starting the year.
Michigan State: The rivalry
for the Paul Bunyan Trophy has
tilted in the Spartans' favor in
recent years. Michigan State
has won five out of the last six
matchups between the teams. It
could be difficult for Michigan
to reverse the trend this year
playing at Spartan Stadium for
the second consecutive season.
Indiana: Little defense was
played in last year's meeting
between the teams when
Michigan beat the Hoosiers,
63-47 at the Big House on Oct. 19.
The Wolverines will be coming
off of two difficult divisional
games against Penn State and
Michigan State, so avoiding a
letdown could be key.
Northwestern: The Wildcats
seem to have had Michigan's
number the past few years.
Threes years ago, the Wildcats'
held a lead in Evanston before
falling apart in the fourth
quarter. Two years ago, the

Wolverines needed a late effort
in the waning minutes to force
overtime and pull out the win.
Last year, they needed a last-
second field goal to hang on
for the win. All that said, the
Wildcats will be without several
key pieces, including running
back Venric Mark.
Maryland: Welcome to the Big
Ten, Maryland. Like Michigan,
the Terrapins are looking to
rebound from a 7-6 season and
have a long road to do it. The
two teams will face off on the
tail end of Maryland's brutal six-
game stretch that includes Ohio
State, Wisconsin, Penn State and
Michigan State.
Ohio State: The Buckeyes
will be without star quarterback
Braxton Miller, but given that
his replacement will have a full
season to grow, Michigan should
still see the dominant team it
saw last season. Ohio State lacks
Carlos Hyde and its powerful
run game and also lacks skill at
cornerback. But Urban Meyer is
24-2 in his two seasons.
Last year's thriller, middle
fingers and broken foot behind
them, this year's game could
have more meaning if the
Wolverines can handle a
manageable schedule.

After '07, defeat means
more to Mountaineers

By ALEJANDRO ZU1NIGA
Managing Sports Editor
In 2007, Appalachian State
shocked Michigan in Ann Arbor,
34-32, in what is recognized
as one of the greatest upsets in
college football history.
That team wasn't led by
current quarterback Kameron
Bryant or running back
Marcus Cox. It was a different
Appalachian State, one manned
by Armanti Edwards and
Dexter Jackson.
The 2014 Mountaineers,
making their FBS debut, were
no match for the Wolverines
on Saturday, providing little
resistance as Michigan rolled to
a 35-point halftime lead and an
eventual 52-14 win.
And because of Appalachian
State's history in the Big House,
this one meant a little bit more.
"I can just imagine how the
guys in '07 (felt)," said defensive
lineman Ronald Blair. "We tried
not to look so far back into '07.
This isn't the team from '07.
"We just tried to put our own
stamp on it, and it didn't end the
way we wanted it to."
The small contingent of
visiting fans did their part,
donning shirts and pins that read,
"Been there, beat that."
But these Mountaineers
couldn't stop Devin Gardner
(13-of-14 passing, 173 yards), or
Devin Funchess (three TDs), or
Michigan's running backs (336
yards).
"Those things happen when
you play good teams," Bryant
said. "When you play a team like
Michigan, you don't get those
mistakes. You've got to play
almost a perfect game."
Appalachian State's struggles
were systematic as much as
they were a product of facing a
superior opponent. Michigan's
defense employed tight, man-to-

man marking, and Bryant had
been prepped by his coaches to
face a zone system.
Last year, Bryant and the
Mountaineers thrived on quick
throws out of the shotgun and
picking up yards after the catch.
The Wolverines' corners, though,
disrupted the rhythm and bought
enough time for the defensive
line to burst into the backfield.
The result was an Appalachian
State offense that managed just
74 yards in the first half. Bryant
finished the game 8-of-19 for just
58 yards.
"This game was not what
(Michigan) had shown all last
year," said Mountaineers coach
Scott Satterfield. "Why they did
that, I don't know."
As Satterfield explained earlier
in the week, many members of
his current team committed to
Appalachian State in part because
of the 2007 upset, which stunned

the college football world and
landed the small school from
Boone, North Carolina on the
cover of Sports Illustrated.
It marked the first time
a Division I-AA (now FCS)
team beat a ranked opponent
from Division I-A (now FBS),
derailing Michigan's national
championship hopes before they
could really begin.
But in Saturday's rematch,
the Wolverines asserted
their dominance from the
opening kickoff, and the 2014
Mountaineers couldn't replicate
their predecessors' magic of
2007.
"Heck yeah, that was in
(Michigan's) minds the whole
offseason," Satterfield said.
"What else do they hear? 2007,
App State came and beat you
guys. That's all they've heard.
You're dadgum right they were
determined."

Campaign sets
$4 billion goal

By SAM GRINGLAS and
JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporters
NOV. 7, 2013 - The University
announced Thursday that the
Victors for Michigan campaign
will be the largest fundraising
drive for a public institution in
history - with an ambitious $4
billion goal.
Victors for Michigan, the Uni-
versity's sixth major fundraising
campaign, will launch Nov. 8.
The University's last campaign,
The Michigan Difference, raised-
$3.2 billion between 2000 and
2008 - surpassing its original
goal of $2.5 billion.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said last winter
that the primary priority for the
campaign will be student sup-
port through financial aid. At
Coleman's leadership breakfast
last month, Coleman reiterated
that $1billion in campaign funds
will be focused on student sup-
port.
Just like the last campaign,
Coleman said in an interview
after the event that passing the
$4-billion mark is possible.
"It is always possible that if

the campaign is phenomenally
successful, then maybe midway
we could raise it," Coleman said.
"There's a lot of analysis that
goes into doing it, but I feel really
good about this number. It's a
very audacious campaign."

paign strategy, not only creat-
ing goals for student support,

CSG votes against divestment from Israel

Hundreds gather in
Union for historic'
assembly decision
By WILL GREENBERG and
KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily News Editor and
Daily Staff Reporter
MARCH 26, 2014 - After
hours of discussion and debate,
the Central Student Govern-
ment reversed the indefinite
postponement of the controver-
sial divestment resolution and
subsequently voted to not pass it
in a 25-9 vote with five absten-
tions early Wednesday morning.
Hundreds of students lined
the second floor of the Michigan
Union and entered the Rogel
Ballroom on a first-come, first-
served basis Tuesday evening,
and more than 2,000 viewers
watched CSG's live-stream of
the six-hour-long event. Uni-
versity Police regulated the
large crowd that formed both
inside and outside the Union
and organized the crowds to
line up on State Street. Students
allowed into the meeting were
given tickets and encouraged
not to leave the room once they
entered. When the meeting
began, the number of people in
the room exceeded its 375-per-
son capacity. An additional 200

students were seated in the
nearby Pendleton Room as an
overflow space.
On March 18, many members
of Students Allied for Freedom
and Equality and its support-
ers attended the CSG Student
Assembly meeting to advocate
for a proposal to encourage the
University to divest from certain
companies allegedly involved in
human rights violations against
Palestinians. After the CSG
assembly chose to postpone the
vote indefinitely, SAFE and its
partners staged an indefinite
sit-in in the CSG chambers and
formed "calls for accountabili-
ty," asking CSG to make amends
for what SAFE viewed as its
poor handling of the situation
and to bring the proposal to a
full vote.
The sit-in garnered attention
across campus leading up to
Tuesday night's meeting. This
week, individuals both support-
ing and opposing the divestment
resolution attended in signifi-
cant numbers. SAFE represen-
tatives and members of the 36
student organizations that have
pledged support for the resolu-
tion spoke to the assembly about
the proposal. Students who
spoke against the resolution did
not identify with specific orga-
nizations, but were encouraged
by several members of Hillel to
attend.

CSG President Michael
Proppe, a Business senior,
motioned to allow a reconsid-
eration of the indefinite post-
ponement of the divestment bill
once the assembly reached the
Motions and Other Business

portion of the meeting. This
motion passed with five dissent-
ing votes, followed by a revote
on the motion to indefinitely
postpone the bill again, which
failed with only seven in sup-

Faculty raise concerns over
'U' consolidation project

Proposed cost
cutting initiative
sparks protest from
faculty, students
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Managing News Editor
DEC. 9, 2013 - Through bit-
ter winds and the frigid snowfall,
echoes of "chop from the top" and
"no AST cuts" resonated across
the Diag.
Marching from Rackham
Auditorium to the Fleming
Administration Building, almost
50 students, faculty and staff
gathered Monday to deliver a let-
ter to Rowan Miranda, associate
vice president for finance. Miran-
da is one of the administrators
involved in the implementation
of the proposed Shared Services
Center - but has come under fire
because of his previous relation-
ship with the consulting firm that
designed the initiative.
The center, a component of
the Administrative Services
Transformation project, would
consolidate some University
departmental staff members into
a central location on State Street
near the University's Wolverine
Tower, creating an estimated
savings of $5 to $6 million per
year. The transition would move
almost 300 clerical employees
to the new location and would
require that they re-interview for
their new positions.
While University administra-
tors announced that they will
delay the transition due to a
slew of faculty concerns and a
1200-signiture strong petition,
the group assembled Monday to
demand a full rollback of the AST
initiative.
Rackham student Brian Whit-
ener, a member of the Student
Union of Michigan, said the let-

ter delivered to Miranda includes
a job application for him to fill
out to be evaluated by the group
of protesters. The gesture comes
after staff members affected by
the Shared Services Center were
required to re-interview for their
jobs with the University.
Along with the Student Union
of Michigan, members of the
Graduate Employee's Organiza-
tion and Lecturers' Employee
Organization also participated in
the march.
Whitener said the mixed group
of student and faculty partici-
pants reflect the importance of
halting the AST initiative by
demonstrating how it negatively
affects the majority of the campus
population.
"We think that the University
should be run in a different way
and it should be run with the pri-
orities of students, who are the
primary attendees of the institu-
tion, and workers, who are the
primary motors of the institu-
tion," Whitener said.
While Whitener said he agrees
that costs should be cut at the
University, he believes AST is
not the right way to do it. He
said upper-level administrators'
salaries should be cut and the
University should halt "needless
and unnecessary" construction
projects that cost millions. SUM
has previously voiced its opposi-
tion to the $180 million Munger
Graduate Residences - the Uni-
versity's largest current construc-
tion project.
"It is a stand-in for a larger
logic of what the University
should be and how the University
should be run, and we're opposed
to that," Whitener said.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said while it is too
early to predict the future plans
for the consolidation initiative,
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack and Tim Slottow, executive
vice president and chief financial

officer, are currently speaking to
concerned faculty members to
gauge their opinions.
"We will continue that impor-
tant dialogue as we work together
to evaluate the different options
for structuring shared services in
the near future," Pollack said in a
statement.
Earlier this year, the University
signed an $11.7-million contract
with Accenture LLP, a Chicago-
based consulting firm, to help
facilitate the AST consolidation
process. Miranda previously
worked for the firm, but Slot-
tow said in November Miranda
removed himself from firm rela-
tions "to eliminate any possibility
of real or perceived bias."
Rackham student Diana Sierra,
a member of GEO, said the AST
consolidation efforts would hurt
the least financially stable staff
on campus and a disproportion-
ate amount of women employees.
"I see this as a very explicit
attack on the workers at campus,"
Sierra said. "You see that the Uni-
versity is trying to handle a so-
called budget crisis on the backs
of its most vulnerable workers,
and I think that's part of a bigger
issue as to who has decision-mak-
ing power on campus."
Although Sierra said that
workers would be potentially laid
off with the implementation of
AST, University officials said in
November that there will be no
layoffs as a result of the new Cen-
ter.
Rackham student Paige Ander-
sson said decreasing resources for
the lower-level workers on cam-
pus sheds light on what she sees
as the larger goals of the financial
framework at the University.
"The focus is away from educa-
tion and the resources to provide
an affordable education - which
affects diversity and all sorts of
other things - to basically enrich
people at the top," Anderson said.

Thom Madden
to replace Rowan
Miranda at head of
AST controversy
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
DEC. 11, 2013 - The Univer-
sity announced Wednesday that
Thom Madden, the University's
director of sponsored programs,
will replace Rowan Miranda,
associate vice president for
finance, as the leader of the
shared services initiative.
Madden will now serve as the
chief architect behind the imple-
mentation of shared services, a
component of the Administra-
tive Services Transformation
Project designed to centralize
275 department-level staff in a
principal service center.
University faculty, staff and
students have raised concerns
about Miranda during the past
month because of his previous
employment with Accenture
LLP, a Chicago-based consulting
firm that the University hired
to facilitate the shared services
implementation. The Accenture

contract is worth $11.7 million.
In a statement, Timothy Slot-
tow, executive vice president
and chief financial officer, said
Madden has worked closely
with departments and faculty on
financial reporting of research
grants, making him a strong can-
didate for the position.
"Thom Madden is inan excel-
lent position to lead the next
phase of this initiative," Slottow
said.
In orchestrating the leader-
ship transition, Slottow said
Miranda's focus was needed
elsewhere as the University
of Michigan Health System
begins steps to acquire Jackson-
based health system Allegiance
Health. The statement also said
Miranda will focus his attention
on the next wave of cost cutting
related to procurement costs and
the selection of the University's
next treasurer.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said Miranda's previ-
ous position at Accenture and
the resulting faculty outcry had
no influence on the change in
leadership.
"As you know, he wasn't a part
of the selection of Accenture,"
Fitzgerald said. "It has nothing
to do with that. It has everything

to do with this project moving
into a different phase. As associ-
ate vice president, he has a very
broad area of responsibility and
needs to focus his attention on
other areas."
He added that the transition
comes at a time when the initia-
tive's strategy has refocused on
seeking additional faculty input
and a more inclusive implemen-
tation process.
"At this point, we've essential-
ly turned the corner for getting
the important input in exactly
what form to move forward,"
Fitzgerald said. "It's gone from
conceiving the shared services
initiative to the best form for
implementation."
The transition in leadership
comes only a few days after
about 50 students, faculty and
staff, many of them members of
the Graduate Employees' Orga-
nization, Lecturers' Employee
Organization and the Student
Union of Michigan, marched
from Rackham Auditorium to
the Fleming Administration
Building to deliver a letter to
Miranda.
The letter included a satiri-

Shared services center set for August launch

Faculty release
40-page letter
addressing issues
surrounding move
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily NewsEditor
MAY 2, 2014 - Though admin-
istrators have spent months
addressing faculty and staff con-
cerns, the University's proposed
shared services center continues
to face criticism leading up to its
official launch date in August.
In recent weeks, University
officials have claimed success in
addressing concerns after outcry
over the consolidation erupted
last fall. However, faculty mem-
bers continue to voice dissent,
as evidenced by a 40-page let-
ter to the regents delivered last
week. The letter, signed by a
dozen faculty members, railed
the University's high administra-
tive salaries, but also launched
criticisms at the administration's
continued pursuit of service cen-
tralization.
The proposed project, which
would congregate about 250
unit- and department-level staff
in a shared operations center, is
predicted to save the University
$5 million annually and is part
of the larger cost-saving initia-
tive, the Administrative Services
Transformation.

With the first phase of its
implementation set for Aug. 4,
110 staff members will make the
initial transition to the shared
services building near Wolverine
Tower.
Thom Madden, the AST senior
project director, said this first
round would include central-
ization of accounts receivable
processing, accounts payable,
benefits administration and
human resource data manage-
ment.
In this phase, 16 of those
employees are moving from units
within schools and colleges, the
vast majority because they cited
preference for positions affect-
ed by the center's first deploy-
ment. The remaining employees
assigned to the new center will
make the move at some point
between January and March.
Madden said his project team
has spent the months leading up
to the implementation engaged
in a "collaborative process" to
ensure employees are prepared
for and comfortable with their
new assignments and faculty do
not face the burden of additional
administrative duties.
The project's next stage will
still require additional engage-
ment on behalf of the Univer-
sity, which Madden said his team
plans to continue during the
summer. Though construction of
the shared services facility will
be completed by the end of May,
he said the University will work

with faculty and staff to mold
business process for the new cen-
ter.
"The next phase has greater
touch points with both faculty
and staff, so we will have a very
comprehensive engagement pro-
cess in place for- this last phase,"
he said.
Madden said this kind of out-
reach has significantly cooled the
outrage expressed by many Uni-
versity faculty members of the
past year.
"The overall temperature for
the shared services center on
campus has gone down dramati-
cally," he said. "I think going
through the engagement process,
having good, open, construc-
tive dialogue with the faculty, is
really starting to resonate. And I
think they know we are not just
giving lip service, we are truly
listening to what they say and we
are acting on it."
AmericanCultureProf.Antho-
ny Mora, one of the authors of the
faculty petition, said this assess-
ment is inaccurate. He noted that
surveys asking for input under-
mined any real critique of the
process and that forums to open
conversation instead consisted of
lengthy presentations touting the
merits of AST.
"There's no way to bring fac-
ulty on board to something that
they actively oppose," he said.
Though Mora said the large
movement of faculty rallying
against the transformation pro-

vided cause for optimism, the
University's response has been
less than promising.
"It was an incredibly rare
moment that there was so much
consensus among such a huge
section of the faculty and the
response by Mary Sue Coleman
was just gut-wrenching for all of
us," he said. "It was astounding
that she treated the faculty as if
they were misbehaving five-year-
olds and basically gave us the
answer that we were doing AST
because she said so."
Coleman initially delayed
transitions beyond April to allow
time for gathering feedback
on the project, but remained
committed to AST's strategy
throughout the process.
Madden said the tangible
evidence of the center's suc-
cess would convince some of the
remaining critics to change their
views. Data accessible to the
public could include, for exam-
ple, markers such as customer
and employee satisfaction, cost-
savings and efficiency measure-
ments.
"These metrics will be very
visible and everybody will seo
how the organization is operat-
ing and the organization will be
managed based on those met-
rics," he said. "I really think
that's what sets this organiza-
tion apart as being a true campus
asset and that's the way it's going
to be governed."

UMHS doctors conduct first
implantation of bionic eye

Student group
hosts third annual
MHacks competition
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
JAN. 21, 2014 -Mike Ross, a
Quicken Loans security guard,
stood watch in the elevator
lobby of the seventh floor of the
Qube building in Detroit on Sat-
urday afternoon. Ross had heard
of hackathons before the week-
end, he said, but this was his first
time interacting with one.
Ross stood tall, watching a
constant trickle of hackers and
organizers go from side rooms
to the main hall elevator. He
wasn't a hacker, but he stood in
one of the best places to watch
the event.
Saturday afternoon was the
halftime of MHacks - the mid-
point - the make-or-break time,
when more than 1,000 hackers
got an idea of whether they'd
be ready to present at Sunday's
wrap-up celebration or have to
accept that their ambitions were
too big.
"I wish I could say energetic,"
Ross said of the atmosphere,
and pointed to the "dozen peo-
ple crashed on the floor," in the
main hall.
The kids that haven't burnt
out are zeroed in on their com-
puter screens.
"They work, work, work and
crash," Ross said.
He wasn't kidding. Walking
through the main hall occupied
by a few hundred hackers meant
stepping over pillows, suitcases,
sleeping bags and sleeping col-
lege kids.
If you haven't heard of
MHacks, here's what you need to
know: There's 36 hours to write
a program or make an innova-
tion, hundreds of students and
an abundance of caffeine. It's
part competition, part collab-
orative learning and part party.
The main hall of the seventh
floor embodied the hackathon
spirit. It might have been a large
office space for an online retail
mortgage lender, but there was
no beige or gray. Brightly col-
ored columns punctuated the
rows of tables taken over by
hackers and the walls were cov-
ered with white boards where
teams argued over scrawled
ideas or bored hackers sketched
out their school's logo.
And there, creativity did
come, but often at the expense
of sleep, hygiene and fashion -
sweatpants and pajamas make
for more efficient hacking.
But on Saturday afternoon,
when competitors rested their
heads on crossed arms and

drooled on the table, the creativ-
itywas at a lull.
The real start of MHacks
came before the Friday kickoff.
Competitors aren't allowed to
present projects they've previ-
ously worked on and they're
encouraged to come up with
fresh ideas. The real start of
MHacks came in the past couple
weeks when those fresh ideas
began to percolate.
A few days before Friday,
Matt Kula, a computer science
major from DePaul University,
was Facebook chatting with
his team, one DePaul student
and two from the University of
Michigan.
"It was a joke, honestly. But
they took it seriously," Kula said
on Saturday of the idea he had
proposed.
"That was a great idea," Engi-
neering sophomore James Kot-
zian said, surprised. "I thought
it was a sweet idea."
The team went along with it
and by Saturday afternoon, they
had built a functioning three-
dimensional Quidditch simula-
tor.
"You can get motion sickness
pretty easy doing some barrel
rolls," Kula said. "It's crazy."
To play the game, the Quid-
ditch player puts on a pair of 3D
goggles hooked up to the com-
puter and straddles a stick with
a Wii remote taped to its end,
twisting and leaning to fly their
broomstick in a recreation of
the stadium made famous by the
"Harry Potter" book series.
Kula said it was a good thing
his teammates didn't pick up on
his original sarcasm.
"We really expected to take
this much longer," he said. "Any-
thingwe do now is kinda a plus."
The group acknowledged
that there are some pretty com-
petitive hackers at these events,
but most students, including
them, come to learn and try
new things. DePaul doesn't have
the large hacking scene that
the University does, Kula said,
meaning hackathons can be a
time of immersive learning.
Nonetheless, the team knows
they've built something good.
"I still wanna win, but ... "
Kula said, trailing off. There's
more than just winning and
losing, he explained. There's
resum building and there's
interacting with other hackers
from across the country.
His team, for instance, was
formed after Kula met some Uni-
versity student at the MHacks
hackathon in November.
Plus, there were plenty of
ways to blow off steam. A break
room adjacent to the main hall
had a Pacman arcade game,
ICEE machine and foosball table
- among other amenities.

A block away, however, a team
fromthe State Universityof New
York at Stony Brook was power-
ing through programming an
annoying alarm clock for your
phone, although their surround-
ings weren't as ideal: two floors
of an unfinished office building
hastily fitted for the event.
Concrete floors, bare walls
and temporary fluorescentlights
gave off an industrial vibe at
best. And this vibe was amplified
when compared to the Qube's
eighth floor, which had views
of Windsor's skyline across the
river and ice skating at Cam-
pus Martius Park. But at least
both locations were only a quick
walk away from Lafayette Coney
Island, home of the world's most
heavenly Coney dog.
Nonetheless, the Stony Brook
team continued coding the app,
which was designed for people
who have trouble waking up
early in the morning, or, col-
loquially speaking, college stu-
dents.
Team member Ted Saint-
vil called it the "dreaded eight
o'clock class," and the three
New York students pointed at
the fourth member of their team
whose head was slumped down
on the desk in sleep.
This team, too, noted that
there were some people who
take the competition very seri-
ously, but those people are the
exception, not the rule.
"You come here to do what
you want to," Kenneth Ramos
said. "I come for the experi-
ence."
Besides, Ramos said, the big-
gest competition was for when
new rounds of food were distrib-
uted. "You ever see a Walmart
on Black Friday?" Ramos said.
But regardless if you're a first-
time hacker or a seasoned pro
looking for recognition, nobody
gets much sleep.
"What is that - sleep?"
Ramos joked.
None of Ramos's team had
more than four hours of sleep,
and even that's considered a
good night's sleep at hackathons.
Kula, despite having the lux-
ury of carpeting in his building,
only laid down for two hours.
"I don't sleep at these things,"
he said. "Too much going on for
me to sleep."
In the end, sleep-deprived or
not, the teams all had memo-
rable experiences. Some came
away with full, functioning
products they had planned for
all along. Others ... not so much.
While Stony Brook didn't place
in the top eight, Kula's team and
their Quidditch simulator placed
second overall. Both teams,
though, left the event as better
programmers. And that's what
it's really all about.

Bobby Dishell,
Meagan Shokar
elected president,
vice president
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
The results are in.
Public Policy junior Bobby
Dishell and LSA sophomore Mea-
gan Shokar of Make Michigan
willibe the CSG president and vice
president, respectively, for the
2014-2015 academic year.
The results come five days after
polls closed for the March 26-27
Central Student Government elec-
tions. Dishell and Shokar won
with 3,937 votes cast in their favor,
beating out their next-closest
competitors - FORUM candi-
dates Carly Manes, a Public Policy
junior, and LSA junior Pavitra
Abraham - by more than 1,000
votes.
Dishell is the current CSG vice
president and Shokar currently
serves as speaker of the CSG
assembly. Both candidates empha-
sized their experience in execu-
tive positions as a strength of their
ticketduringthecampaignperiod.
After receiving the news,
Dishell congratulated his support-
ers for their collective effort.
"All the credit goes to this
team," Dishell said. "We couldn't
be more proud of everyone."
CSG President Michael Proppe,
a Business senior, a large support-
er of Dishell and Make Michigan,
attended the party's makeshift
event. 4
"He's been right at my sid4 the
entire time this year," Proppe said.
"I'm really excited to see what
they're going to do next year."
Six complaints filed with the
University Elections Commission
delayed the release of results, but
each case was either resolved or
dropped by Tuesday afternoon.
The rulings had negligible impact
on the official results of the elec-
tion.

The complaint with the great-
est potential consequence was
dropped on Monday when Make
Michigan officially withdrew its
suit against FORUM for alleged
abuse of e-mail privileges.
Make Michigan filed the com-
plaint against its rival party after
LSA junior Domenic Rizzolo, out-
reach co-director for FORUM,
sent a campaigning e-mail using a
listerv he did not own. If the UEC
had ruled FORUM guilty, the
party would have faced demerits
for each recipient of the e-mail in
question. The total accumulation
of demerits would have exceeded
limits outlined in the election code
and resulted in the disqualifica-
tion of each FORUM candidate.
After further reviewing the
case, Dishell concluded that Riz-
zolo's e-mail would have had
marginal impact on the election
itself and decided to withdraw his
suit. In a statement sent out to all
candidates announcing the with-
drawal, Dishell said he wanted to
avoid the hostile environment and
unproductive intra-CSG rivalries
created by a lengthy litigation
process. He added that he filed
the official complaint initially to
uphold the provisions of the elec-
tion code.
"You can always withdraw, just
like we did," Dishell said. "But I
can't, after the fact, go back and
say, I really wish we had filed this."
The official complaints regard-
ing alleged campaign finance
infractions by FORUM, the Party
Party and the House of Cards
Party were.upheld and addressed
in a UEC hearing Monday eve-
ning. Business senior Matthew
Fernandez, rep-manager for Make
Michigan, filed the complaint on
behalf of Make Michigan, citing
failure to publish receipts on cam-
paign finance forms as a major
infraction.
Dishell said these cases, in con-
trast to the alleged e-mail misuse,
could have had an impact on vot-
ing. He said possible overspend-
ing could have created an unfair
advantage.
In an official ruling released

Tuesday, the UEC found all three
parties guilty of the infraction, but
reduced the punishment outlined
in the election code. Whilea major
infraction usually calls for three
to four demerits per violation, the
UEC instead assigned two demer-
its per party.
The UEC cited miscommunica-
tion between candidates and the
election director as well as vague-
ness of the wording of the election
code as grounds for reducing the
number of demerits assigned for
the violation.
In the ruling, the UEC said
campaign finance forms provided
to candidates did not explicitly
contain instructions for receipts
that were called for in the code.
Additionally, once respondents
were made aware of the violation,
they provided the appropriate
receipts.
These demerits did not affect
the outcome of the election in
any way. Parties are penalized for
demerits until they reach 10, at
which point that party is removed
from the election entirely.
Law student Bryson Nitta, elec-
tion director, released a dissenting
opinion along with the UEC's offi-
cial ruling. Nitta acts as an ex offi-
cio member of the UEC and does
not vote on official rulings.
Nitta expressed discontent
with the demerits assigned to-
FORUM, the Party Party and the
House of Cards Party.
"Candidates and students are
not law enforcement officers
trained in detecting deceit and
fraud," Nitta wrote.
Manes and Abraham hugged
fellow FORUM candidates after
receiving the news that they did
not win. Manes said their work
will not stop despite the election's
outcome.
"We wholeheartedly believe
that titles don't really give you
any extra power," Manes said. "If
students believe in doing things,
they can get things done just by
their own motivation and their
own personal drive and passion
because they care about things."

Students file formal
complaints in
response to Theta
Xis "ratchet" theme
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
October 30, 2013 -An inves-
tigation has been launched into
the University's chapter of the
Theta Xi fraternity after several
students filed formal complaints
with the University administra-
tion regarding the fraternity's
now-cancelled plans to host a
party with a "ratchet" theme
next Thursday.
Many students of color say
they were personally offended
by the invitation that was sent
via Facebook, complaining that
it parodied Black culture and
offended women, referring to
twerkingcontests, "bad bitches,"
gang references and repeated
use of the word "ratchet."
Early Thursday morning,
Theta Xi members said the fra-
ternity won't be commenting on
the matter. Fraternity brothers
were camped out on the Diag for
their annual "Defend the Diag"
ritual.
Dean of Students Laura Blake
Jones, who lodged a formal com-
plaint with the fraternity, said
the University responded imme-
diately and took student com-
plaints very seriously.
Jones held a meeting yester-
day with the Greek Life Director
Mary Beth Seiler, Interfrater-
nity Council leaders and LSA
senior Eric Quang, Theta Xi's
president. The University
also reached out to Theta Xi's
national board, whose members
expressed concern and are con-
ducting their own investigation.
The administration made it
clear that the party will not be
allowed to take place on Nov. 7,
and Theta Xi's national head-
quarters has determined all
further social events will be sus-
pended until their investigations
are concluded.
"It was very important that
we all get together and discuss
the impact this unfortunate
event has had on the Univer-

sity community, as well as our
expectations moving forward,"
Jones said. "Obviously, the way
the party was both conceived of
and executed is in direct contra-
diction to the standards of our
university."
Jones plans to meet with stu-
dents Thursday to discuss ways
of remedying the situation, as
well as making sure their under-
lying concerns about racial
issues on campus are addressed.
Additionally, an e-mail inform-
ing students of the discussion
and expressing disappointment
was sent out Thursday morning
to address a largely "negative"
situation.
While Jones stopped short of
calling events like this a trend,
she said it's clear that some
level of education and dialogue
is necessary to ensure that stu-
dents are aware what language
and behavior is appropriate, and
how cultural appropriation has
potential for harm.
"In society we certainly see
examples, not only in parties
but in the media and how people
present themselves; it's certainly
not a problem unique to Greek
Life or our campus," Jones said.
"The incident in question was
not only racially offensive, but
degrading to women in general,
and the most restorative way to,
move forward is to provide edu-
cation on why this is not accept-
able."
The fraternity is in the pro-
cess of drafting an apology to
the students who came forward,
which will later be broadly cir-
culated as a means of accepting
responsibility for their situation,
Jones said.
LSA junior Geralyn Gaines,
secretary for the Black Student
Union, described her initial
reaction to the event as "com-
plete and utter disgust." She said
this was the first time she's per-
sonally experienced racism on
campus or felt specifically tar-
geted and attacked.
"I love U of M and even today
I'm fundamentally happy, but
it's scary to think that I sit in
class with people who think this
way and people that agree with
them, people who legitimately
thought this party was a good
idea and was okay," Gaines said.

"The invitation amplified stereo-
types and used a level of disgust-
ing language that it was evident
they activelytried to offend us."
Gaines said she was particu-
larly offended by the use of the
word "ratchet," which she says
is prominently used in the Black
community to describe some-
thing terrible or someone who
doesn't know how to handle
themselves. She also took issue
with the invitees section, which
specifically asked for "bad bitch-
es" and "rachet pussy," which
she believes was an attempt to
make a mockery of Black cul-
ture.
Gaines believes that requir-
ing the University to approve all
party themes moving forward
would help avoid similar issues
in the future.
Music, Theatre & Dance
senior Erica Nagy said she was
compelled to write a formal
complaint after seeing the emo-
tional toll the situation took on
her roommate.
"We were all mad and found
the situation unacceptable,
especially after seeing how
upset she'd been the whole day
after carrying this hurt around
with her," Nagy said. "You don't
have to be a certain race to be
offended by racist matefial; I
think anyone who isn't offended
isn't paying attention."
She specifically took issue
with the fact that no one
involved in the fraternity identi-
fied with Black culture and that
they used language "that wasn't
theirs to use" in an attempt to
directly offend people.
Though this was the first time
she had been invited to a party
with an offensive theme, Nagy
she knows it happens often -
both in and out of Greek Life -
because people don'tunderstand
the ramifications of cultural
appropriation.
"I guess my hope for all of this
is that it starts a conversation
about race on this campus so
that people can learn that their
words and actions truly affect
other people," she said. "I don't
want to see (Theta Xi) punished
because I don't think that would
solve the true problem here; we
need to get people talking and
learning."

ADMINISTRATION
UMHS president and 'U' chief financial officer step down

After serving five
years as head of
health system,
Pescovitz moves on
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
MARCH 17,2014 - OraPesco-
vitz, CEO of the University of
Michigan Health System and
executive vice president for med-
ical affairs, announced in a blog
post Monday morning that she
will step down after her five-year
term ends on June 1.
Pescovitz, the first woman to
serve as the head of the health
system, has worked in her cur-
rent position since her 2009
appointment.
"I want to express my deep
appreciation to Dr. Pescovitz
for her commitment to Michi-
gan and for ensuring that the
Health System remains sound
and strong, which is an enor-
mous accomplishment given our
complex environment and the
changing national health care
landscape," Coleman wrote in
an e-mail to faculty and staff on
Monday.
As EVPMA, Pescovitz oversaw
the University's medical opera-
tions - three maino enitels .n

outpatient locations and more
than 120 clinics around the state
- as well as the Medical School,
School of Nursing and various
research initiatives throughvari-
ous departments and institutes.
Under Pescovitz's tenure,
UMHS has implemented major
renovation projects, most nota-
bly the construction of the $754
million C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Women's Hospi-
tal, completed in 2011. She also
oversaw the transfer of several
research departments from the
medical campus to the North
Campus Research Complex after
the University purchased the for-
mer Pfizer property in 2009 at a
cost of $108 million.
In a communication to the
University's Board of Regents,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman recommended Michael
Johns, professor of otolaryngol-
ogy and health policy at Emory
University, to serve as interim
EVPMA effective June 2.
A Detroit native, Johns gradu-
ated from the University's medi-
cal school in 1969 after obtaining
a bachelor's and graduate degree
in biology from Wayne State Uni-
versity.
"I look forward to the leader-
ship, depth of experience, and
vision that Dr. Johns will bring
to the University," Coleman
wrote. "I appreciate his willing-

ness to serve his alma mater and
his home state in this important
way."
Johns formerly served as dean
of the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine and vice president of
Medical Faculty from 1990 to
1996. He later became the execu-
tive vice president for health
affairs at Emory before serving
as chancellor from 2007 to 2012.
The recommendation will go
before the Regents for approval
at their next meeting this Thurs-
day.
In recent years, the Health
System faced scrutiny because
of a series of internal controver-
sies. In 2012, Stephen Jenson, a
medical resident, was charged
for possession of child pornogra-
phy, which was found on a thumb
drive plugged into a Health Sys-
tem computer. Slow response
to the incident prompted the
restructuring of the University's
Department of Public Safety,
Housing Security and Hospitals
& Health Centers Security into
the Division of Public Safety and
Security. Jenson was later sen-
tenced to three years in prison.
Later in 2012, the U.S. Securi-
ties and Exchanges Commission
sued Neurology Prof. Sidney
Gilman in regards to a poten-
tial insider-trading scheme. The
commission alleged that infor-
mation provided by Gilman
allowed Matthew Martoma, a
portfolio manager at CR Intrinsic
Investors, to profit $276 million.
Gilman later admitted in court
that he had provided information
regarding an Alzheimer's drug
trial to Martoma before it was
released to the public.
More recently, financial pres-
sures from sequestration and
expansion projects have caused
the Health System to explore cost
cutting measures, while steadily
increasing patient demand has
kept the majority of the health
system operating at capacity.
Despite the pressure, Coleman

GREEK LIFE
Stabbing at SAE prompts
debate over party security

7C - Fall 2014

Doubts raised over
impact of sober
monitor training
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
Despite the stabbing of two
members of the University's
chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon fraternity early November
by an angry party-crasher, the
Interfraternity Council is con-
flicted as to whether existing
security measures are sufficient
to handle future incidents.
The assault at SAE occurred
after four individuals were
kicked out of the fraternity
house, leading to a heated verbal
altercation in which the suspect
drew a knife and stabbed two
sober monitors.
Because SAE was expelled
from IFC in 2011 for hazing
allegations, the chapter's sober
monitors were not required to
complete University Health Ser-
vice's Sober Monitor training,
and the chapter was not under
jurisdiction of IFC's Social Envi-
ronment Management Policy. .
SEMP provides a mandatory,
19-page protocol for hosting an
IFC social event. Strict SEMP
guidelines are enforced by the
Social Responsibility Commit-
tee, which is composed of 13
Greek-affiliated students. On
party nights, members make
rounds as "checkers" to patrol
for policy violations. During
that time, sober monitors must
submit to breathalyzer tests by
request of SEMP checkers, who
also have the right to shut down
a party if deemed necessary.
Whether SAE was following
the SEMP policy the night of
the attack is unclear. Brandon
Weghorst, a national spokesman
for SAE, could not be reached
for comment after repeated
requests.
SRC, however, does not moni-
tor events that are unaffiliated
with IFC; like parties at SAE.
LSA junior Tommy Wydra,
the SRC chairman, said there

are serious safety concerns for
students at unregulated off-cam-
pus fraternities, but praised the
sober monitor training required
of IFC fraternities.
"I'm very confident that an
incident like this would not
occur at any of our fraternity
houses because of the training
that we go through," Wydra said.
Training for sober monitors -
the orange-shirt-clad fraternity
members who man the doors and
serve alcohol at many fraternity
parties - includes preparation
for dealing with sick party-goers,
violent confrontations and crowd
control.
However, Andrew Koffsky,
former president of AEPi, said in
a previous interview that he was
less convinced the sober monitor
training could prevent such an
assault.
"No 19 or 20 year old knows
how to deal with somebody who
has a knife and is trying to get
into a party," Koffsky said. "None
of us are trained to have mortal
combat abilities."
Stephen Siddall, risk manager
for the University's chapter of
the Chi Phi fraternity, echoed
Koffsky's concerns about the
stabbing.
"I think it's really scary; it
really could have happened at
any fraternity," Siddall said.
As risk manager, Siddall
approves plans for Chi Phi's par-
ties, works the front door and
coordinates up to 10 sober moni-
tors around the fraternity's prop-
erty.
Siddall said he had little for-
mal training aside from shadow-
ing the previous risk manager.
While Siddall admitted none of
his sober monitors are trained to
deal with a weapon, he said hir-
ing additional security - as some
fraternities have - would be
overkill, and he put the onus on
guests for keeping parties safe.
"People just need to under-
stand that fraternities are not
throwing open parties every
night," Siddall said. "Ninety-nine
percent of our parties are closed
events."
But when fraternities plan

massive parties - usually with
attendance of 500 people or
more - some risk managers see
a third-party security team as a
necessary investment.
K-9 Patrol, a risk manage-
ment consulting firm based out
of Dearborn Heights, Mich., has
been employed this year by the
University's chapters of Sigma
Alpha Mu, Alpha Sigma Phi and
Alpha Epsilon Pi. The company
provides pre-event guidance,
onsite armed and unarmed
guards and post-party consulta-
tions.
Timothy Schar, CEO of K-9
Patrol, said his guards are pro-
fessional and act as a strongvisu-
al deterrent to help reduce the
chance of an assault.
"We're not a company that
goes and puts a bunch of 300-
pound gorillas out there with
black t-shirts that say 'security'
on the back, because that's not
security," Schar said.
The company even deals with
angry neighbors through a hot-
line designated for complaints.
Guards generally cost $280,
and most parties need between
three and five guards, depending
on the number of guests, Schar
said. Most fraternities spend
between $1,000 and $1,500
upfront on his company's ser-
vices, and there are no refunds if
a party gets shut down, he said.
Without private security,
Schar said most fraternity par-
ties on campus have serious safe-
ty and liability issues.
"I would say probably 20 per-
cent at best have security that
is active and functional," Schar
said.
Still, the exorbitant costs
required to hire a company
like K-9 Patrol remain a strong
enough deterrent for some risk
managers, like Siddall.
"We haven't been asked to
(hire security), and that's an
added cost that we don't neces-
sarily need, and I really don't
think its necessary from a risk
management perspective," Sid-
dall said.

SACUA addresses alcohol
consumption trends at 'U'

Concerns include
drinking during
Welcome Week,
orientation
By ANDREW ALMANI
Daily StaffReporter
The Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs met
Monday with several adminis-
trators who are working towards
reducing the public health risks of
alcohol consumption on campus.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, Chief Health
Officer Robert Winfield, director
of the University Health Service,
Wolverine Wellness director
Mary Jo Desprez and J. Ann
Hower, director of the office of
new student programs, joined
SACUA for the meeting.
During her presentation,
Desprez presented materials on
alcohol consumption trends and

strategies for combatting high-
risk drinking. She said 64 percent
of students drink socially, and 61
percent drink to celebrate.
At one point, Desprez asked the
faculty seated around the table if
they were familiar with the "I'm
Shmacked" video filmed at the
University. No one in the room
had seen it, so Desprez proceeded
to play the video and explain the
role that social media plays on the
environment that induces drink-
ing for students.
"I'm Shmacked"' is a video
series that glamorizes partying
and alcohol consumption at cam-
puses across the nation. There
are at least three "I'm Shmacked"
productions featuring the Uni-
versity.
"This (video) has 807,749
views, while the University Cam-
pus Tour video only has 63,202
views," she said. "This is recruit-
ing students before we get to. I
might not play the whole thing,
because it sucks your soul."
"The social network and the

viral nature of the Internet is
in some ways is great on college
campuses, and it also has aharder
time for us to manage in terms
of the perception of alcohol use,"
Desprez said.
Hower spoke about the chang-
es the University is considering
making to the orientation process
due to concerns that new students
have easy access to parties and
alcohol, posing a high risk of irre-
sponsible drinking.
Another concern expressed
is the time students have before
classes start, while many are
moving to Ann Arbor. Several
speakers expressed concerns that
Welcome Week fosters an unsafe
drinking environment-especial-
ly for new students.
Several SACUA members
said they were concerned about
the issue,, and requested addi-
tional meetings to discuss ways
in which the administration is
working to make progress.
The last SACUA meeting of the
term will take place April 28.


IFC votes to ban hard liquor
at Tier 3 fraternity parties

COLD
From Page 1C
sory Committee for University
Affairs meeting Jan. 13 to discuss
the University's decision to not
cancel classes.
"By the time it became clear
that we were facing an extraordi-
nary weather event, we realized
that we didn't have appropriate
mechanisms to close the Univer-
sity even if we wanted to," Pollack
said.
During that meeting, Pollack
said the University planned to
establish a committee to address
emergency situations, including
weather, that merit the cancella-
tion of classes.
Though that committee was
formed and held one meeting last
week, Fitzgerald said the deci-
sion to cancel classes Tuesday was
made independently of that com-
mittee, in consultation with the
the office of the Provost, Winfield

and Thomas.
"This is a decision that was
made based on the unique circum-
stances that are being presented
with the weather forecasts for
tomorrow," Fitzgerald said. "This
is not a reflection of any new pro-
tocol."
Business senior Michael
Proppe, CSG president, said he
believes the dangerous conditions
Tuesday warranted the historic
measure.
"It's really going to be cold
tomorrow, I think the University
made the right call," Proppe said.
"When it's -25 degrees out with
the wind chill and you have stu-
dentswalking10, 15, or 20 minutes
to class, it can be dangerous to
have skin exposed in that kind of
weather."
Proppe said he was surprised
becausesuch adecisionis"unprec-
edented," but added that he knows
the University has students safety
at the forefront.
I "Though CSG did not play an

active role in today's decision,
executive members brought up
the school's lack of a severe weath-
er policy in their last few meetings
with the dean of students, Laura
Blake Jones," Proppe said.
While many students may
spend tomorrow binge-watching
Netflix or enjoying some other
form of leisure, Proppe said his
cold day will likely consist of
catching up on homework and
CSG related projects.
Eastern Michigan University
and Washtenaw Community Col-
lege also have canceled classes for
Tuesday.Accordingto the Twitter
of the State News Twitter, Michi-
gan State University spokesperson
Kent Cassella said that MSU is
expected to "continue operations
as usual."
St. Joseph County in Indiana,
where Notre Dame is located, is
under a state of emergency and
driving after 7 p.m. is subject to a
$2,500 fine.

Decision lauded as
step towards higher
on-campus safety
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
Some fraternity parties will
now be a little easier on the liver.
In a nearly unanimous
vote Wednesday night, the
Interfraternity Council
amended its Social Environment
Management Policy to ban
hard liquor at fraternities' open
parties. The new policy will be
effective immediately.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, Central Student
Government president, first
announced the policy change at
the meeting of the University's
Board of Regents Thursday.
"This is a proactive step
that Michigan students are
taking to improve our safety on
campus, and I commend the IFC
leadership," Proppe said.
The new policy comes less
than two months into IFC
President Tommy Wydra's
first term as the organization's
leader. Proppe said Wydra is
getting off to a successful start.
The SEMP amendment
applies to Tier IIIA and Tier
IIIB parties, known as "open
parties," which are limited
to 200 guests, along with the
hosting fraternity members.

"Due to the elimination of
hard liquor at Tier IIIA and
IIIB events, students will
enjoy a safer social scene at the
University of Michigan for years
to come," the IFC stated in a
press release.
The policy will not apply to
National Pan-Hellenic Council
or Multicultural Greek Council
parties because SEMP only
applies to the IFC and Pan-
Hellenic Association.
Wydra said the new policy
extends only to open parties and
not lower-tier parties because
the former tend to be the riskiest,
such as those during Welcome
Week or on Halloween.
"Many of the Greeks get
so much training, whether
it's sober monitor training or
alcohol awareness, so we feel
they can manage those Tier
II parties much more easily,"
Wydra said. "I have absolutely
no plans to expand it to Tier II
or Tier IIICs."
Proppe said the amendment
will help improve safety at the
larger parties.
"The nice thing about a Tier
II party is you know who is
going to be there and so it's a
little bit more of a controlled
environment," Proppe said. "At
a Tier III party that's open to
students who are not necessarily
a part of the Greek organization,
it's harder to control and hold
people accountable."
Kinesiology junior Elive

Likine, a member of the Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternity, better known
as Pike, said the policy might do
the opposite of its intention.
"I think it's going to turn into
people pre-gaming harder and
drinking faster in preparation
because they'll know they won't
be able to have it at the party,"
Likine said. "Some people
just don't like beer. When you
prevent something like this, I
feel like it will end up blowing
up in their own face."
As for enforcement, Wydra
sai d the Social Responsibility
Committee - a group of Greek
members who enforce current
SEMP policy - would be able to
take on the amendment.
"When SRC comes they hit
the bathroom, they hit the
bar, wherever people are SRC
goes and checks," Wydra said.
"They're going to be interacting
with guests at these parties and
randomly checking three to five
guest IDs. As long as there is no
hard alcohol, it will be ok."
Wydra added that he believes
the amendment will be accepted
without much controversy
among members of Greek Life.
"Once every Greek member
completely understands the
policy they will be on board
with it," Wydra said. "It's a lot
different if the Greeks think
we're taking away something
just to take away something
rather than doing it with good
intentions."

country are carrying out similar
fundraising drives - but the Uni-
versity's goal is closer to many
private schools than public peers.
Harvard Universityis currentlyin
the midst of the largest fundrais-
ing drive in the history of higher
education - with an ambitious
$6.5 billion goal. The campaign
launched earlier this year and will
conclude in 2018.
LSA Interim Dean Susan Gel-
man wrote in an e-mail that her
priorities for the campaignfocus on
financialaid,includingscholarships
dedicated to assisting students pay
for study abroad and internship
experiences, as well as undergradu-
ate research opportunities.
"We are committed to the lib-
eral arts, and we have evidence
from the stories of our alumni that
scholarship support makes a tre-
mendous difference, not only for
an individual student - maybe the
first in his or her family to attend

college - but also for siblings,
relatives, and entire communities
who are inspired and encouraged
by seeing dreams become reality,"
Gelman wrote.
The University has received
$1.7 billion in gifts in the twoyears
leadingup to the officialkickoffon
Friday.
In the last few months, dona-
tions from philanthropists includ-
ingStephenRoss, Charles Munger,
Penny Stamps, Helen Zell and the
Rogel and Frankel families have
donated gifts earmarked for an
array of new facilities, scholar-
ships and programs.
Coleman said these leadership
gifts highlight diverse areas of the
University - ranging from arts
and humanities to the Business
School, student support and ath-
letics. She added that the flagship
donations serve as examples for
smaller benefactors.
Ross, who donated $200 mil-
lion in September to his namesake
business school and the Athletic
Department, serves as chair of the
campaign.

On Wednesday, the University
announced a $50 million donation
from Richard and Susan Rogel -
which will benefit the Medical
School and the Center for Chinese
Studies. Richard Rogel served as
chair of The Michigan Difference
campaign and will serve as vice
chair of the Victors for Michigan
campaign - spearheading the
overall push for studentsupport.
Three students attended the
press conference to answer ques-
tions about how the campaignwill
support them. LSA senior Kather-
ine Man, a non-resident student
and a member of the Global Schol-
ars program, said without her
financial aid, she would not have
been able to attend the University.
"This opens the opportunities
for students who are good stu-
dents but don't have the financial
means," Man said.
The Victors for Michigan cam-
paignkick-off will begin Friday at
5 p.m. with a community festival
in Ingalls Mall, the main event in
Hill Auditorium and an after-par-
ty, ending at 10 p.m.

Sierra echoed Anderson's
points about financialization at
the University - one of SUM's
main issues. As the University's
Black Student Union recently
made national news by bringing
the experiences of Black students

- who constitute 4.65 percent
of enrolled students - on cam-
pus to light, Sierra said college
affordability for students from
diverse backgrounds should be
the University's top priority.
While the University's enroll-
ment does not directly relate to
the fight against AST, Sierra said
it reflects a larger issue of who
has the decision-making power

on campus.
"I think this initiative is part
of a larger effort to really address
those diversity questions in a
way that is not an empty buzz-
word (like) the University wants
to paint in their pamphlets, but
that if you're actually interested,
you actually need to have people
be a part of the process."

CAMPUS LIFE
Music Matters hosts festival

SpringFest
features 2Chainz
and student
organizations
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
In the third installment of its
annual SpringFest celebration,
MUSIC Matters pulled out all
the stops Thursday.
Rain served as an enforced
recess between the afternoon's
activities and the night's cap-
stone concert - which climaxed
as rapper 2 Chainz strolled onto
the Hill Auditorium stage, bel-
lowing his moniker to the heav-
ens.
During the day, food trucks
and live entertainment stretched
along North University Avenue
from Hatcher Graduate Library
to North University Avenue,
while 40 student organizations,
organized by themed tents, pre-
sented their year's work. Lasting
from 11 a.m. to 6p.m., the festivi-
ties built up to 2 Chainz: the day's
headlining act.
After his performance, 2
Chainz explained in an interview
how he connects to a diverse set
of audiences.
"I just think I'm very trans-
parent," he said. "What you see
is what you get. I'm like this
on and off camera - at home,
chillin' out. I've got a good spirit.
I'm very blessed and I think that
kind of projects to the crowd.
It's organic. People like it and I
appreciate it."
LSA senior Phil Schermer,
MUSIC Matters president, said
SpringFest as a whole - which
was revamped to resemble Aus-
tin music and technology festival
South By Southwest - exceeded
his expectations.
"My phone was dead for 45
minutes," he said. "I turned
it back on - had 46 texts from
people who were excited about
SpringFest. It's unbelievable."
Schermer said the festival's
new layout, which aimed to both
inspire and showcase student
accomplishment, set a strong
precedent for future improve-
ment. He said he hopes that
MUSIC Matters will recruit
more student organizations to
present next year, in addition to
bringing in more food options
and more live outdoor concerts.
One of Thursday's live per-
formers was LSA sophomore
Sylvia Yacoub, who was formerly
a top 10 contestant on thehird
season of NBC's "The Voice?' She
said the venue gave her a chance
to cater to a local audience, which
she appreciated.
"I thought it was a lot of fun,"
she said. "The crowd was awe-
some. I loved the energy ... It was
really cool to just perform with
students. It's the demographic,
essentially, that I want to jump to
when I release my album some-
time this year."
Yacoub performed a roughly
10-song set that included covers
of Jessie J., Christina Aguilera
and Rihanna. She also sang a
slow, acoustic version of Taylor
Swift's "I Knew You Were Trou-
ble."
Musical acts like Yacoub's
were intertwined with entrepre-

neurial-themed talks through-
out the day. University alum
Mike Muse, one of the nation's
top political fundraisers and the
co-founder of record label Muse
Recordings, delivered one of
these presentations.
In his speech to students,
Muse emphasized the close ties
between music and politics -
both mechanisms of enacting
change.
"We're here about SpringFest
and we're here about 2 Chainz
are we're here for MUSIC Mat-
ters, but really, what is the pur-
pose for us being here?" he asked
during his talk. "The purpose
is engagement. The purpose is
activism. The purpose is to build
community. The purpose is to
bust down the segregated walls
that we have here on this cam-
pus."
Muse has also been named the
first director of MUSIC Matters'
future board, which he said will
ultimately consist of profession-
als who "have ties to both the
intersection of pop culture and
change agents." This group will
work with outside sources to

help fund and build MUSIC Mat-
ters in the coming years.
Muse said he became involved
with MUSIC Matters after
Schermer reached out to him
earlier in the year, as he was
impressed with the similarities
between his work and that of the
student organization.
"I was using music to make
fundraising fun, and to make it
cool, and to make it inviting, and
to break the ice and say, 'This is
what politics looks like now,"' he
said, adding that his career and
MUSIC Matters "share a very
unique symbiotic relationship
that runs parallel."
On a similar tangent of devel-
opment, MPowered hosted an
event called MTank - modeled
after ABC's "Shark Tank," where
start-up entrepreneurs pitch
their potential productsato world-
renowned business moguls.
Five groups pitched their
products to a board of local ven-
ture capitalists, and ultimately a
product called "S-Pack" won the
contest.
According to a handout dis-
tributed by MPowered prior to
the MTank, S-Pack works to
"solve the problem every woman
faces by combining several essen-
tial toiletries into one product
small enough to fit in any wom-
an's purse."
Business sophomore Mariel
Reiss presented the product,
which she said targeted college-
aged women who might need
to freshen up following a night
on the town or even a drunken
hookup.
Engineering junior Chris
O'Neil, MPowered president,
credited SpringFest for provid-
ing entrepreneurship with a
wider audience.
"I'm kind of stuck in the entre-
preneurship end of this univer-
sity, and I think that SpringFest
was a really unique opportunity
to have an event that had a little
higher entertainment value - so
you have these people who maybe
aren't as familiar with entrepre-
neurship get to see what is going
on and see all the cool startups
and ideas that are actually hap-
pening on campus," he said.
Tom Frank executive direc-
tor of the University's Center for
Entrepreneurship, said there is
no longer a "normal" entrepre-
neurship crowd.
"I think that it's more about
people who have innovative
ideas; that they're becoming
less and less shy about sharing
with an audience, as opposed to
something thinking of an entre-
preneur as somebody locked in
a room who's going to build and
invent something that suddenly
gets released on the world," he
said. "They make it more collab-
orative, more open and a safer
environment to let those ideas
cross-pollinate."
This "cross-pollination"
of thought Thursday was not
restricted to entrepreneur-
ship. Schermer said the Identity
tent, located directly outside of
Hatcher Graduate Library, was
also a large factor in the trading
new ideas.
The Black Student Union pre-
sented a photography exhibit in
the tent as a culmination of the
#BBUM movement. LSA senior
Tyrell Collier, outgoing BSU
speaker, said the pictures were

meant to explore the experience
of Black students at the Uni-
versity in a new medium. The
photo-shoot largely took place
primarily in an alleyway off of E.
Liberty Street.
"We just wanted to show -
because the environment that we
shot in was a rough environment;
there was trash, dumpsters, some
bricks - we really just wanted to
get across the beauty in black-
ness, even in the roughest envi-
ronments," Collier said.
Despite 20 mph winds, Collier
said the extreme weather did not
impede the project's success.
"We were placed right on the
Diag proper," he said. "So there
was a lot of traffic. Even just stu-
dents going to class - there was
a lot of traffic flowing through
our tent. I don't think it's every
day that you see a tent with about
24 different pictures of Black
people."
University alum Jeff Sorensen,
a co-founder of social innovation
group optiMize, also commented
on the event's success in show-
casing student accomplishment.
Though optiMize had been

planning to host a dunk tank fea-
turing "well-known" students on
campus - including CSG repre-
sentatives and student athletes -
these efforts were halted early in
the day by the University's Risk
Management Services, Sorensen
said.
However, he added, opti-
Mize was most successful with
its whiteboards, on which buzz
words like "diversity," "health"
and "education" were written
and students were asked to write
down what those terms meant to
them. Sorensen said
optiMize received several

hundred responses, all of which
are now displayed in the Center
for Entrepreneurship.
Sorensen also lauded the work
of optiMize finalists, who pre-
sented their innovative projects
throughout the day.
As for the future of Spring-
Fest, Schermer said the best is
yet to come.
"I think it's going to be so
much bigger and better than it
was this year," he said.

Fashion show
promotes art
and ingenuity


EnspiRED event
features student
models, designs
By BRIE WINNEGA
Daily StaffReporter
Student models donning
undergrad-produced designs
stomped down the runway Sat-
urday night.
EnspiRED, a student orga-
nization that aims to promote
artistic expression at the Uni-
versity, hosted the fashion show.
Taking place in the Biomedical
Science Research Building, it
also featured pieces from artists
nationwide.
The event is traditionally
EnspiRED's biggest of the
year, LSA senior Tyrell Collier,
EnspiRED production manager
and president, said.
"We wanted to show that you
can be innovative, you can be
creative, and you can do things
that are outside of the norm,"
Collier said. "I feel like when
people leave this show this will
be something they've never seen
before on campus."
In its eighth year on campus,
EnspiRED donated 15 percent of
the show's proceeds to Art Road
Nonprofit, an organization dedi-
cated to funding art classes in
southeast Michigan schools that
have lost support for their pro-
grams. EnspiRED is also plan-
ning a trip to Detroit to assist
the nonprofit through volunteer
work. The majority of the gener-
ated money will fund this year's
and next year's show.

The show featured five waves
of clothing designs: Liberation,
Creation, Innovation, Domina-
tion and Live Red Nation.
"To 'live red' means to be
happy, be creative and just be
you and do what makes you
happy," LSA senior Danetta
Jameson, an EnspiRED model,
said.
Collier said he hopes to dem-
onstrate the positive influence
African American students
have on campus through orga-
nizations like EnspiRED and its
fashion show.
"We are a majority Black
organization, meaning that
our executive board is a major-
ity African Americans," Col-
lier said. "This is being Black at
Michigan to me."
For the first time, Music,
Theatre and Dance sophomore
Stephon Dorsey had the oppor-
tunity to showcase his own
clothing designs from his line
called Vision by Goodsteph.
"I wanted to showcase some-
thingthat exemplifiedthe whole
idea of using what you have to
get what you want," said Dorsey.
"At first, it was definitely a little
hectic, and I was a little anxious
and worried, but once I was able
to see everybody on the screen
- that was the most glorifying
moment of my life."
LSA junior Taylor Clayborne
said she enjoyed the outfits,
models and venue that the show
had to offer.
"I think that it's awesome
that they're using local and stu-
dent clothing lines," Clayborne
said. "I'm really impressed that
this was all student-run."

TAKE THE FIELD

SLOTTOW
From Page 6C
In a letter to colleagues in
the University's Office of Busi-
ness and Finance, Slottow said
the country's future relies not
only on institutions like the Uni-
versity, but also on those more
focused on meeting the needs
of non-traditional, mid-career
adult students. With the Univer-
sity of Phoenix's online program,
a college education is available to
a larger number of students and
professionals.
"As you know, I am passion-
ate about higher education and
believe deeply in the important
role the University of Michigan
plays in preparing future leaders
and helping to solve many of our
most vexing societal challenges,"
he wrote. "We know, too, that
our country's competitiveness
will rely on the full spectrum

of higher education opportuni-
ties to educate our workforce so
it can meet its potential and fuel
U.S. economic development."
The departure also poses an
additional challenge for Univer-
sity President-elect Mark Schlis-
sel, who will need to fill multiple
interim positions at the begin-
ning of his term. S. Jack Hu is
currently serving as the interim
vice president for research, and
Michael Johns will fill in as
interim CEO of the University of
Michigan Health System follow-
ing Pescovitz's departure.
During his 12 years in the posi-
tion, Slottow led the University
through a number of cost-saving
initiatives designed to keep bud-
gets in check during a period of
decliningstate funding.
Slottow piloted programs such
as strategic sourcing - procure-
ment measures designed to save
money by buying equipment
and supplies in bulk across mul-

tiple University units - and the
Administrative Services Trans-
formation Project - an initiative
that will centralize department-
level employees in a shared ser-
vices center.
"Collectively we have met the
largest and smallest challenges
- posed by our external environ-
ment and rapidly changing cam-
pus needs - with innovative new
ways of doing business," Slottow
said in his statement.
In October, Slottow
announced the University's
endowment reached an all-time
high of $8.4 billion over the fiscal
year. The endowment is now the
second-largest of any public uni-
versity, according to the National
Association of College and Uni-
versity Business Officers and the
Commonfund.
During Slottow's time at the
University, the endowment has
increased from $3.5 billion in
2003 to $8.4 billion.

port. Proppe's motionto reconsid-
er Resolution 3-050 then passed
with only three dissenting votes.
Despite an amendment to line
105 of the resolution, adding the
phrase "pending the results of
the ad hoc committee," the pro-
posal did not pass. It was voted
on in a secret ballot, an amend-
ment to the rules decided by the
assembly to ensure the safety of
individual representatives.
LSA senior Suha Najjar, one of
the original authors of the reso-
lution, said while it wasn't the
complete outcome that members
of SAFE wanted, she was happy
their voices were not silenced
this time.
"I am upset. I am disappoint-
ed. But more so, I am very proud
of what we've accomplished,"
she said. "Last week there was a
decision to indefinitely postpone
and resolutions like that don't get
called back in here, but because
of our persistence and because of
our determination we came back
and we fought and we got to say
what we wanted to say."
She added that the sit-in is now

over and SAFE members will not
no longer occupy the CSG cham-
bers.
After the vote, supporters of
the resolution left the chambers
in silence to rally at the Cube in
front of the Fleming Adminis-
tration Building. Speakers at the
Cube shared their plans to take
a divestment proposal to the
University's Board of Regents,
thanked the resolution's sup-
porters at large - particularly
the large number of non-Pales-
tinian supporters - and advised
all members to remain cautious
on their way home given the per-
ceived hostility on campus after
last week's vote.
During the Community Con-
cerns portion of the meeting,
selected members of the audience
are given a three-minute time
allotment during which they are
allowed to make statements to
the assembly. During the bill's
second reading, authors of the
resolution continued the discus-
sion. Guest speakers opened the
meeting, followed by 90 minutes
of Community Concerns. Usual-
ly, only 30 minutes are allocated
for Community Concerns, but
the CSG assembly voted twice to
extend this time limit.

Dishell and LSA sophomore
Meagan Shokar, speaker of the
assembly, said the hostile cam-
pus climate in the wake of the
March 18 meeting threatens the
democratic process and would
not be tolerated. SAFE represen-

tatives told The Michigan Daily
that members have been receiv-
ing racist comments, have been
yelled at on the street by people
driving by and have been classi-
fied as extremists. CSG members
claimed to receive similar threats
and members of both groups
have reported some individuals
do not feel safe enough to attend
their classes.
Administrators have met
repeatedly with SAFE and the
members of the sit-in, as well as
other groups, hearing the vari-
ous accounts of threats received
by CSG representatives as well as
members. of the sit-in. In antici-
pation of the meeting, E. Royster
Harper, vice president for student
life, sent a campus-wide e-mail
early Tuesday evening remind-
ing students of the University's
policy regarding freedom of
speech and artistic expression
outlined in its Standard Prac-
tice Guide. She urged students to
remain respectful and tolerant of
diverse viewpoints.
Harper referred to a previous
Daily article, an official response
from Proppe and a statement
from Palestinian students and
allies to provide students with
context of the issue.

LETTER
From Page 2C
The center will also be gov-
erned by an institution-wide gov-
ernance council. The University
has not yet determined whether
these representatives will be
elected or appointed.
"There will be faculty who
truly do not believe in this as the
right direction for the Univer-
sity," Madden said. "But until the
center is stood up and can prove
the value-add that it brings to
campus, there's going to be that
segment of campus that doesn't
believe this is correct. But I fully

believe that once this service cen-
ter is stood up and proves this
works, many of these conversa-
tions will simply dissipate."
However, if last week's letter
to the regents from a group of
faculty is any indication, faculty
will likely attempt to keep the
pressure on the University. Even
though the shared services center
is moving forward, Mora said the
concerns are part of larger issues
with the University's administra-
tion.
"I think there are immediate
concerns about AST's proceed-
ings and we want to make sure
staff are protected and they are
going to be treated well, but ulti-

mately I think there is this coun-
ter pressure to do some house
cleaning in the upper administra-
tion as well," he said.
But as the August launch date
nears, preparations for the cen-
ter's full operational capacity
have not stalled. The shared ser-
vice center's director, Pam Gabel,
officially assumed her duties last
week, which Madden declared a
"significant milestone." He also
said the project team will contin-
ue holding town halls and meet-
ings within colleges to gather as
much feedback as possible.
"My full belief is that this orga-
nization will be a significant val-
ue-add," Madden said.

shared services center.
Business junior Sumana Palle,
a SUM organizer, said the Uni-
versity's decision to replace
Miranda is almost certainly a
reaction to recent faculty and
student uproar. Palle said she
does not believe the timing of the
University's announcement was
coincidental.
"They thought maybe if we get

rid of this particular person the
protests will die," Palle said.
However, Palle said Miranda's
departure from overseeing the
shared services transition does
not translate into a total victory.
She said faculty and students are
still have broader concerns with
AST, such as the University's
approach to cost-cutting and
failure to gather input outside of
Fleming.
"This is not an overall success,"
Palle said. "This is a very small
victory in the fight against what
is going on at the University."
Palle said SUM plans to con-
tinue their fight against AST in
low-key forms such as letter writ-

ing or seminars as well as public
demonstrations. Protest, she said,
garner attention and educate the
campus community as well as
show administrators the pres-
ence of vocal and widespread dis-
sent.
Additionally,, Palle said the
University should have acknowl-
edged faculty and student con-
cerns as the cause of AST's
leadership transition. f
"That comes off as very uncar-
ing at a time when you have to
show staff who are very angry
with you that you genuinely
care," she said.

PICK-UP GAME


New high-rise
projects to move
forward near 'U'

Construction
seeks to offer 'wide
appeal' through
urban-loft styling
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily Staff Reporter
JAN. 24, 2014 - Two develop-
ment companies have received
authorization from the Ann Arbor
City Council to build new high-
rises near campus.
One building will be built on top
of the south side of Pizza House
at 624 Church Street, near South
University Avenue. The 14-story
building will consist of 76 units,
74 percent of which will be either
one bedroom or two bedrooms. It
is projected to open to tenants in
August2015.
University alum Bradley Moore,
owner of the Ann Arbor-based
architecture firm J. Bradley Moore
and Associates, will oversee devel-
opment and construction of the
high-rise above Pizza House. The
restaurant's owner, Dennis Tice,
and Opus Group, a Minneapolis-
based development company,
partnered with J. Bradley Moore.
Moore likened the atmosphere
of these new apartments to an
"urban loft" style, adding that the
development company intends for
them to have a wide appeal.
The building is estimated to
cost $17 million, although the
specifics of the construction plan
are not yet solidified. After the
plan is approved and a building
permit received, the surrounding
area south of Pizza House will be
demolished.
In addition to housing units, the
new building will also feature an

outdoor seasonal dining area on
the first floor.
The housing addition near pizza
house has been in the works for
years. A decade ago, J. Bradley
Moore designed an addition to
Pizza House intending to expand
it in the future - including a stron-
ger foundation that would accom-
modate a larger structure.
"When we designed the addi-
tion to the Pizza House, we actu-
ally had enough foresight toput in
extralarge foundations to preserve
the ability to someday inthe future
build vertically on top of that part
of the building," Moore said.
The second high-rise, with its
construction overseen by a Con-
necticut-based real estate firm
called Greenfield Partners, will
be located at 413 E. Huron St. and
Division Street. It will be 14 stories
high and include 513 bedrooms
and a two-floor underground
parking facility. The construction
is estimated to cost $45 million.
Both the former and cur-
rent owner of the property were
unavailable for comment.
The approval of its construction
was a controversial move by Ann
Arbor City Council, The Michi-
gan Daily reported. The Coun-
cil was originally opposed to the
structure's potential commercial
infringement on the community's
atmosphere but feared that the
developers would file a lawsuit if
their petition was denied.
Moore acknowledged that
while receiving approval from
the Ann Arbor City Council is
challenging for larger downtown
construction projects, the process
went smoothly for the Church
Street structure.
"I think there's a great demand
right now for housing anywhere in
the downtown area," Moore said.

unique sustainable designs of
the store, including LED light-
ing, an energy-saving instant

ficient green wall that features
live plants, as features she was
particularly proud of.
The cafe will be the first cof-
feehouse to be certified LEED

Council, she said. LEED certifi-
cation indicates that a business
has met certain construction

reduce the impact they have on
the environment.

bring a lot of foot traffic to the
area," he said.
Medical School student Erin
Conrad said she is very excited
to have another coffeehouse to
use as a study spot near campus.
"Since this store is close to my
apartment and Central Campus,
I'll most likely visit Sweetwa-
ters more often than before,"
she said. "I also like their music
and the seating arrangement is
great."
As for the rest of the build-
ing, Cavender said a lease has
already been signed for one of
the two empty spaces left, an
8,000 square-foot space fac-
ing Maynard Street, and nego-
tiations are currently underway
for the other.

POLICY
MERC ruling upholds GSRA's
ineligibility for unionization

DONATIONS
Grad. students express concerns
over design of new 'U' housing

Decision follows
long legal battle by
University research
assistants, state
By SHOHAM GEVA
Summer Managing News Editor
JUNE 20,2014 - In a decision
issued Thursday afternoon, the
Michigan Employment Relations
Commission ruled that graduate
student research assistants at the
University are not public employ-
ees, and thus are not eligible to
unionize.
The ruling, which was made
at the commission's June 10
meeting, was the culmination
of a almost three year long legal
debate on the issue.
The commission found that
University GSRAs are not eligible
to unionize because there was
not significant enough evidence
to prove that their situation had
changed since 1981, when MERC
ruled that the work GSRAs did
primarily benefited themselves,
not the University, rendering
them not public employees and
thus not eligible to be unionized
as a collective group.
"The record establishes that
in in 2012, as in 1981, a GSRA
appointment closely tracks a
student's own specific academic
goals," the decision read. "Almost
all GSRAs seek out projects in
order to find a subject that will
serve as the basis in some way for
their dissertations."
All hearings for the case were
held before administrative law
judge Julia C. Stern in February
of 2012.
This connection between
work and academics was the
prime determinant in classifying
GSRAs as non-public employees,
as well as the close relationship
typically observed between fac-

ulty and GSRA, according to the
decision.
The MERC case was brought
by University union Graduate
Employees' Organization and
the state affiliate of the American
Federation of Teachers in April of
2011. It represented the groups'
second try to re-open the issue
following an initial, unsuccessful
petition for consideration. The
case was temporarily stalled for
almost two years up until earlier
this year after the state legislature
passed an amendment to Public
Act 45 banning GSRA unioniza-
tion in 2012, which was declared
unconstitutional in February.
The unionization efforts were
not contested by the University
following a 6-2 vote in favor of it
by the Board of Regents in 2011,
though many top administrators,
including University president
Mary Sue Coleman, expressed
opposition to the idea.
In a statement Friday morning,
GEO said they withdrew their
original 2011 petition on the issue
on June 9th, 2014, one day before
the commission's meeting, and
called MERC's decision to rule on
it the demonstration of an anti-
labor agenda.
In reaction to the decision,
they characterized it as inaccu-
rate and unfair to GSRAs.
"GSRAs do work, they have a
supervisor, they have to report
to the lab every day, they pay
taxes, and the University itself
recognizes GSRAs as workers,"
the statement read. "The work
GSRAs do is vital to the univer-
sity's research enterprise which
now has expenditures well over
a billion dollars a year. To claim
that GSRAs are not university
employees is unjust and unethi-
cal."
A spokesman for MERC said
the decisions speak for them-
selves in regards to why the case
was ruled on after the original
petition was pulled.

AFT Michigan President
David Hecker expressed similar
sentiments in an interview Fri-
day morning. He said though they
weren't surprised by the decision
because the current commis-
sion was all appointed by Gover-
nor Rick Snyder, who along with
other state Republicans has not
supported GSRA unionization
efforts, it was a clear, disappoint-
ing case of an outside body inter-
fering with an employer's own
definition of who its employees
are.
"GSRAs are clearly employ-
ees," he said. "The University of
Michigan recognises that."
Hecker said AFT Michigan
will continue working towards
GSRA unionization through col-
laboration with local groups in
the state such as GEO, as well as
other advocacy efforts. He added
that they are not currently con-
sidering submitting a third peti-
tion to MERC.
Stephen Raiman, founder of
Students Against GSRA Union-
ization, which filed an amicus
brief against unionization in the
case and was active in earlier
debates around the issue, said ina
statement Thursday evening that
the organization was happy to see
the issue finally resolved, and to
know that GSRAs could continue
their research without fear of
outside influences.
"We are pleased that MERC
has decided to keep political
interests out of academia, and
allow academic decisions to be
made by academics," the state-
ment read.
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette (R) and former Uni-
versity GSRA Melinda Day, who
was active in earlier proceedings,
also filed amicus briefs on the
case in opposition to unioniza-
tion.

the design 'experimental.' Harp-
er said Munger Residence Hall
intends to cater to students in a
variety of graduate programs.
However, the residence hall will
not be suitable for graduate stu-
dents with families and children.
Harper stressed repeatedly
in response to suggestions for
plan changes from the audience
that she and the administration
had to remain within the wishes
of Munger's vision for the resi-
dence hall, as he continues to be
deeply involved with the plan-
ning process.
"If this were 'just us' and
the funding were 'just us,' we
would have some different

nating some of the costlier room
features proposed. "But I think
when you are in partnership
... you make some agreements
about what you're going to offer,
then we have to honor those
agreements."
In an interview after the
forum, Harper and Baier both
said they expect the residence
hall to be highly successful,
despite mixed reactions from
students.
"It has this wonderful com-
bination of your own privacy
- your own room, your own
bathroom, your own study space
- and then you come out and you
have this fabulous living space,"
Harper said. "What it feels like is
you get to be at home when you
want, sort of in your space, and
then you can be in a kind of'cof-
fee shop' if you will with people
that you know and like."
Harper said there would like-
ly be opportunity for students to
choose roommates, though there
is currently no plan for room
assignment or other logistics,
like parking.

~University to demolish North Hall

Post renovations,
former East Quad
recalled fondly

Repairs to current
building deemed
too costly
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
SEPT. 23, 2013 - South Quad
Residence Hall might look a bit
rough right now, but another
building on campus will have
it worse.
North Hall, the buildingthat
currently is home to the Uni-
versity's ROTC programming,
is set for demolition, pend-
ing approval by the Board of
Regents.
Operations Officer Wayne
Doyle said the building is being
torn down because repairs to
the current building would be
too costly.

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the building,
located on North University
Avenue near the C.C. Little
Building and the Museum of
Natural History, is "more than
a little old."
North Hall was built
between 1899 and 1900 as the
Homeopathic Hospital Build-
ing, according to records from
the Bentley Historical Library.
It has housed ROTC programs
since 1940.
Fitzgerald said plans for
demolition and reconstruction
of North Hall will be up for
approval by the University's
Board of Regents next month.
Therefore, he could provide
only limited information at the
time.
"It's been in development for
a long time," Fitzgerald said.
"It's a project that will try to

solve multiple problems on
campus."
Lt. Col. Allana Bryant, a pro-
fessor of military science, said
ROTC programs will be relo-
cated in May, and the building
will be torn down in June. It's
not clear where the ROTC pro-
gram will be held during con-
struction.
Fitzgerald declined to
comment on the timeline of
construction, but said more
information will become
available once the project is
approved.
Nursing junior Meghan
Conger, an Army ROTC cadet,
said she spends several hours a
week at North Hall because it's
the meeting place for almost
all of her ROTC activities. She
added that she's disappoint-
ed the building will be taken
down, as she thinks of it as a

campus landmark.
"It's a very unique building
with a lot of purpose, and it's a
building that's special to cadets
and midshipmen because it's
solely for ROTC operations,"
Conger said. "Not alot of other
students know about it or can
use it."
Conger was surprised by the
decision to raze the building,
because she thought it was in
good condition. She said the
building's basement isn't in the
best condition, but the class-
rooms, lounges and offices
appear to be in good shape.
"The building is undeniably
old-looking, but I think it has
a lot of charm," Conger said.
"While the building is getting
older and we can undoubtedly
find another area for us, North
Hall holds a lot of memories
and will be missed."

Students, faculty
and alums honor
North Hall before
demolition
By MICHAEL SPAETH
For the Daily
JULY 11, 2014 - Friday,
members of the University's
Reserve Officers Training
Corps held a small ceremony
on the front lawn of North Hall
to pay tribute to the building
they called home for 74 years in
advance of its scheduled demo-
lition.
The building is being demol-
ished to make room for the
new 300,000-square foot
Biological Science Building,
approved by the University's
Board of Regents in February,
which will house the Depart-
ment of Molecular, Cellular
and Developmental Biology,
the Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology, and col-
lectionsfromthe Anthropology,
Natural History, Paleontology
and Zoology museums.
.,At the event, current and
retired members of the Univer-
sity's Air Force, Army and Navy
ROTC units adapted the tradi-
tional Naval decommissioning
ceremony, which signifies the
end of a Naval ship's active ser-
vice, to mark the end of North
Hall's service to the University.
Captain Joseph Evans, pro-
fessor of Naval Science and
Commander of the University's
Naval ROTC, said though the
building was never commis-
sioned as a ship, it served the
same symbolic purpose.
"North Hall, much like any
naval ship, faithfully served
us all and all of us who ever
worked inside her walls knows
well that it's formed a personal-
ity all of its own, full of charac-
ter and spirit," Evans said.
He added that in a sense the
building was a vessel, not for
traveling on water but for the
training of students.
NorthHallwasbuiltbetween
1899 and 1900, and is the sec-
ond-oldest building on campus
still in use after the President's
House. From 1900 to 1922, the
building served as the Uni-
versity's Homeopathic Hospi-
tal. It then became the South

UPPER: ROTC students perform a final color guard ceremony on July 11, 2014 at North Hall, the home af theROTC pro-
gram for 74 years. LOWER: A bell is rung to decommission North Hall, an adaptation from naval tradition.

University stopped studying
homeopathy.
In the early 1940s, the build-
ing was renamed North Hall
and became home to the Uni-
versity's Navy ROTC program,
with the University's Army
and Air Force ROTC programs
joining a decade later. All three
programs relocated to the
Chemistry building last May.
During the ceremony, Evans
highlighted several memorable
moments in North Hall's his-
tory. On December 8,1941- the
day after Japan attacked Pearl
Harbor during World War II
- a local newspaper reported
that more than 100 University
students stood outside the com-
manding officer's office to sign
up to fight in the war, he said.

North Hall was also bombed
three times. The first, in June
1969, was felt two miles away
and broke 60 windows, though
nobody was injured.
University alum Captain Phil
Klintworth, an executive con-
sultant at Tetra Tech and for-
mer professor of Naval Science
who also spoke at the event,
said in an interview after the
ceremony that he was surprised
there wasn't more of an effort to
preserve North Hall as a histor-
ic landmark. However, he added
that he agreed with the regents'
decision.
"From a practical stand-
point, I mean, the building is
old, it certainly doesn't meet
fire codes, it's very expensive to
keep it in repair," he said. "If I

were on the Board of Regents,
I'd probably make the same
call."
Commander Scott Howell,
associate professor of Naval
Science and Executive Officer
of the University's Naval ROTC
Unit, said before the ceremony
that the event was bittersweet.
He added that moving forward,
he would like to see the Univer-
sity's ROTC program continue
to thrive and increase its cam-
pus visibility.
"I'm proud of our students,"
Howell said. "They're an amaz-
ing bunch of young men and
women who volunteer to serve
the country, go to school - I
mean, this is a tough school to
get into, so they're extremely
bright, extremely intelligent."

2 Chainz plays A

2 Chainz during his action-packed Ann Arbor concert

The superstar
rapper performs
an energetic show
at Hill Auditorium
By ADAM THEISEN
Daily Arts Writer
APRIL 11. 2014 - "Put your
hands up if you believe in God,"
2 Chainz screamed into the
microphone in the opening
minutes of Thursday night's
show at Hill Auditorium. At
least 90 percent of fans put
their hands up as 2 Chainz -
formerly known as Tity Boi,
born Tauheed Epps - launched
into "I Do It," one of the hard-
est-hitting songs on last year's

killer LP B.O.A.T.S. II: Me
Time. Throughout the night,
the packed three-decker crowd
of students at Hill pogoed and
danced to every song, shouting
2 Chainz's lyrics back at him
and finishing his sentences
with roof-raising energy when-
ever called on to do so.
Bursting onto the scene
a few years back with hits
like "Mercy" and "No Lie," 2
Chainz hasn't receded from
the spotlight since. Dropping
successful single after success-
ful single, he has cultivated an
adoring fanbase, one that loves
his enjoyable escapism, deca-
dent beats and quotable lyrics.
Dressed in mostly simple,
non-flamboyant clothes,
except for his titular gold

chains, the 6'5" Epps dominat-
ed the crowd, shaking the place
all the way up to the top deck
with his incomparably char-
ismatic brand of hip-hop. As
he moved from hit song to hit
song, fans got wilder and wild-
er. The audience was glued to 2
Chainz's energetic stage move-
ments all night, never staying
still for more than a moment
and making waves on the rol-
licking main floor.
Thanks to two massive-sell-
ing albums and tireless feature
work, 2 Chainz is now one of
the most beloved and success-
ful rappers in the game today.
However, this superstar is no
up-and-coming young gun. 2
Chainz didn't even have a solo
record deal until he was 34

years old. Proving those who
think rap is a young ;man's
industry wrong, 2 Chainz has
lit up the scene with his suc-
cess. Thursday's show at Hill,
the culmination of SpringFest,
only proved 2 Chainz's .com-
mercial clout.
Throughout the night, 2
Chainz threw smash after
smash at his adoring fans, play-
ing to the first few rows and
projecting himself all the way
up to the nosebleeds. Prac-
tically every song has had a
long run on radio within the
past two years: "Bandz a Make
Her Dance," "Birthday Song,"
"Feds Watching" and "No Lie"
just to name a small few. Beats
from superproducers like Mike

tire dor- gane, Jojen Reed) lost their lives,
y floor can fall silent on a and there was no shortage of
ay night, with the exception cathartic villain deaths (Tywin
clash of steel on steel play- Lannister was slain on the toilet).

A few storylines that have been
languishing all season (Jon Snow
and Bran Stark's dull adventures
north of the Wall), received a
new jolt of life. And the emotion-
al appeal of the show is as strong
as ever, as Daenerys heartbreak-
ingly chains her beloved dragons
and Tyrion faces another family
betrayal.
But amid the excitement,
there was a palpable sense of
hesitance and fear. Sure, this sea-
son of "Game of Thrones" was
action-packed, but how long can
it sustain this degree of vigor?
Although Lady Stoneheart, a res-
urrected and vengeful Catelyn
Stark, was supposed to appear in
this episode (as per the pages of
George R. R. Martin's "A Storm
of Swords"), she was notice-
ably absent. Fan favorites Sansa
Stark and Petyr Baelish were
entirely missing from the last
two episodes of the season. And,
the tragedy of poor Reek has
remained undeveloped for sev-

eral weeks. Obviously, the writ-
ers are choosing to save some of
the events of the third "Song of
Ice and Fire" book for future sea-
sons, but underlying that deci-
sion is a troubling thought. As
GRRM takes his time writing the
sixth book in the series, there's
a very real possibility that the
show could catch up to the events
of the novels, and "Game of
Thrones" could run out of mate-
rial to adapt.
The finale was also a showcase
for another flaw that haunted
the fourth season. Jaime Lannis-
ter, former chivalric Kingslayer,
has never been the same since
his disturbing rape of his sister/
lover. Again, the violence of this
scene was not present in the
book, and continues the disturb-
ing tendency "Game of Thrones"
has toward gratuitous sexual
assault. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau
did wonderful work with the
additional material he was given,

B-SIDE LEAD
The story of the Safe Sex Store

S3 promotes sexual
health and pleasure
among campus
community
By EMILY PITTINOS
DailyArts Writer
FEB. 26, 2014 - My first time
entering the Safe Sex Store (S3)
was on my 18th birthday. A
group of other freshmen and
I wanted to celebrate my new
legality by doing something
new and adult, so we stumbled
through the glass door and into
a wonderland of sexual delight.
Rows of brightly colored vibra-
tors in all sizes and shapes
saluted us from their plastic
stands. Giggling nervously, we
ran our hands through a buck-
et of Magnum condoms, their

gold wrappers glinting in the
sunlight that poured in from
the giant glass windows facing
South University. We sheep-
ishly eyed edible underwear.
Varying versions of the Kama
Sutra lined the bookshelves;
they were mysterious to me,
packed with secrets that felt
forbidden in other places but
seemed to proudly sing, "I'm
sexy and I know it," in this par-
ticular space.
We didn't stay long that day
- beef stroganoff was waiting
for us in the dining hall - but
I continued to think of S3 as
a place of adventure. I hardly
returned, but I liked the idea
of the store's presence. It was
exciting to be inside; it seemed
like a place of silly fun. When-
ever I walked by, I cracked a
little smile.
But S3 is actually much more
than an emporium of dildos

and flavored condoms.
BethAnn Karmeisool, a
vibrant woman in her early
40s with a new set of braces
and easy passion in her voice,
started the store in 1995. It was
the tail end of the AIDS crisis,
which began in the late 70s and
killed hundreds of thousands
of people before anyone fully
understood how the disease
was even spreading. Though
hope was slowly approaching
people were learning how to
prolongthe disease's transition
from HIV to full-blown, lethal
AIDS with incredibly expen-
sive and often harmful drugs -
fear was everywhere.
"People were afraid to hug
each other. People were afraid
to kiss each other," Karmeisool
said, her voice's bright tone
flattening into one of sadness.
"20 years ago, when I'd be in
a group of people and I'd say

'What is your number one fear
regarding your sexual heath?'
They would .say, 'HIV, con-
tracting HIV.' People were
afraid to die."
Most of the hysteria came
from a misunderstanding about
the disease. People were get-
ting bad information - many
thought AIDS could be con-
tracted from poppers, toilet
seats and skin-to-skin contact
- which led to panic amongst
even those who were low risk.
At the time, Karmeisool was
23 years old with a job incor-
porate America. She was mak-
ing plenty of money; she owned
her own house and had two
nice cars. But she was stunned
that people were still contract-
ing and dying from a disease
that they could easily avoid if
armed with the right facts. She
wanted to help save those inno-

2 CHAINZ
From Page 1D
Will Made It, Pharrell and
DJ Mustard blasted out of the
Hill's speakers at an eardrum-
shattering volume that could've
possibly made this the loud-
est show in the history of Hill
Auditorium. "I'm Different" and
"Mercy" probably got the loud-
est, most shout-along crowd
reaction, but with as many hits
as 2. Chainz has, every song
played is going to be somebody

in the audience's favorite.
But what is it about 2 Chainz
that makes him connect so well
with fans? To hear him say it,
the answer is his transparency.
"What you see is what you
get," he said backstage after
the show. "The energy from the
crowd is organic. People like it,
and I appreciate it."
The answer fits in with the
titles of his first two albums-
Based on a T.R.U. Story. While
other rappers tire themselves
out by ceaselessly elevating
themselves as much as possible,

bragging about all the cars they
buy and women they're with, 2
Chainz conveys an unparalleled
confidence and swagger around
his performances. Unlike some
of his pipsqueak imitators, he's
so blunt and strong when he
boasts about money and status
that you can't help but believe
everything he says. You for-
get about the artist-fan divide
when he performs because his
style is so conversational and
his mindset seems so similar
to yours. 2 Chainz is the easi-
est rapper to imagine yourself

wingmanning at a house party.
Adding to this organic and hon-
est image is 2 Chainz's engag-
ing onstage persona, he teased
the audiences about the Uni-
versity's basketball team, say-
ing that he had the Wolverines
going all the way and that "you
fucked up my bracket." He's the
last rapper you'd ever accuse of
being pretentious. His songs cut
right to the point, and he has no
qualms about trying to make
music that's accepted by a wide
audience.
"Being consistent and work-

ing hard" is what 2 Chainz says
is the key to a hit song. In just
the span of a few short years,
he has built up an impressive
following through music that's
built on earnest, confident fun.
The audience knows that with
every 2 Chainz verse they're
going to get the perfect com-
bination of quotable phrases,
charismatic swagger and tech-
nical confidence. He's created
a brand based around the exact
kids who went to see him at Hill
- young kids who want to have
a good time to hard-hitting rap

music. It's almost unheard of to
see a rapper as old as 2 Chainz
connect with youth culture as
much as he has, but he does it
at his shows night after night.
In every 2 Chainz song, and at
the Hill Auditorium show, you
can hear a man who has trav-
eled a long, long road to star-
dom. 2 Chainz knows that he
got where he is now because
of his fans, and now he's com-
mitted to give back to them by
recording the music they want,
and performing for them with
all he's got.

FILM REVIEW
'12 Years a Slave' apowerft triumph

'12 Years' went on to take home the Best Picture award at the 2014 Oscars

Year's best film
is provocative,
courageous and
visceral
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Arts Writer
NOV. 4, 2013 - Simply put,
"12 Years a Slave" is the best
of the year, a triumph - a proj-
ect of courage
and heart thatA
is unsettling,
provoking and 12 YD'S
truly stirring.
it portrays a Slave
slavery in all FoxSearchlight
of its horror
and forces the
audience to
examine a past typically shoved
to the deepest recesses of the
mind.
Based on the memoir of its
protagonist, the film stars tbi-

wetel Ejiofor ("Salt") in an
award-caliber performance as
Solomon Northup, a free man,
husband and father of two, who
lives out his days in happiness
in New York - until 1841, when
he is kidnapped and sold into
slavery. During his captivity, he
is moved to different owners of
varying degrees of cruelty.
Paul Giamatti ("Turbo"),
in that slimy fashion he does
so well, plays Solomon's first
owner, a slave trader who quick-
ly sells him to Ford (Benedict
Cumberbatch, "Star Trek Into
Darkness"), a devout Christian
that shows a sort of pity for his
slaves. He reads scripture to his
workers every Sunday and goes
so far as to treat Solomon almost
as family, later protecting him
from his twisted overseer (Paul
Dano, "Prisoners"). All in all,
Ford seems to be a good man,
but does his very involvement
in the practice of slavery make
him evil?
Ford eventually sells Solomon

to Edwin Epps (Michael Fass-
bender, "Prometheus"), another
deeply religious man that uses
the Bible to justify his role as
master, contrasted to Ford's use
of scripture as a means of salva-
tion. Epps prides himself on his
reputation as a "slave breaker,"
doling out lashings on a daily
basis, raping the young women
to fill his lust. Fassbender's por-
trayal of Epps will be compared
to Ralph Fiennes's portrayal of
Nazi war criminal Amon Goeth
in "Schindler's List," an evil
man of no redeeming quality
and unrelenting cruelty - much
like Fiennes, Fassbender should
receive an Oscar nod for his
work.
The audience is subjected
to multiple scenes of suffer-
ing, brutality and violence, and
without the brief levity of, say,
a Tarantino script heavy on sar-
casm, it will likely become bur-
densome for some viewers. And
yet I myself could not look away
from the screen. My eyes never

turned from the writhing bod-
ies being hanged, the lacerated
backs and bloody shirts. It's a
testament to the greatness of
the performances; to miss even
the slightest nuance, the sub-
tlest expression is to miss some-
thing profound.
But it's even more than that.
As much justice as the actors
owed to finding the truth in
their characters, we, too, owe
Solomon Northup and the
countless others like him our
undivided attention, to finally
accept that our past is a dark
one, to acknowledge that Edwin
Epps was as real as the man or
woman in the seat next to us in
the theater.
Many film critics are lament-
ing that it took an English direc-
tor (Steve McQueen, "Shame")
to craft the film that "properly"
portrays American slavery. But
there is no better director than
McQueen to tackle the central
human condition of this proj-
ect: pain. All of McQueen's

films have focused on the pain
imposed on their protagonists
by their societies, and McQueen
then uses that pain and suffer-
ing to explore each character's
strength of will. Despite the
blood, sweat and tears through-
out "12 Years a Slave," there is
something beautiful to be found.
I expect this film will be
taught to future film students
for every aspect of what makes a
great film, from Hans Zimmer's
haunting score, to the power-
ful performances and strong
writing, all the way down to
the importance of each linger-
ing angle of the camera. It's a
fantastic film, and no amount of
praise will satisfy.
Make no mistake that "12
Years a Slave" will be a classic
for one reason: For 133 minutes,
the story of Solomon Northrup
comes to life.
As an audience member, you
will not see a movie but a life,
a real life filled with sorrow
and tragedy, but also with hope

and strength - a story about
perseverance and healing as
equally as torment. Each gaz-
ing stare from Ejiofor reveals
a man breaking inside, strug-
gling every day to fathom just
why this fate has befallen him.
And yet, even as he burns what
is likely his last hope for rescue
(a letter home), as those embers
slowly smolder and fade into the
black night, Northup's will to
endure, to survive, to live never
falters.
And at last, when the credits
roll, when you have dried your
eyes and left the darkness of the
theater, you will recognize that
what you have seen is poetry as
much as it is biography. You will
turn to your friends or family
and you will discuss what you
have just witnessed, and you
will be haunted by every crack
of the whip as much as you will
be moved by the mounting cre-
scendo of each spiritual, and
you will realize that you feel
alive, so very alive.

Fall 2014 - 3D

GOT
From Page 1D
but Jaime's sugary-sweet broth-
erly caretaking toward Tyrion
seemed insincere considering
his past transgressions. In the
finale, Cersei spited her father
Tywin by gleefully admitting to
the "twincest" affair, but the fol-
lowing passionate scene between
the siblings was viscerally unset-
tling. Hopefully, time heals the
injury to what used to be one of
the most unique relationships on
television.
Tyrion's heartbreaking jour-
ney from circling the outskirts
of Lannister approval to being
imprisoned was one of the best
threads of the season, but his rag-
ing murder spree in this episode
was unnerving. Tyrion ruthlessly
choked Shae, a kind prostitute
and the supposed love of his life,
with a necklace. Though Shae
was a relatively minor charac-
ter, her confidence with Tyrion
was refreshing and his tender-
ness toward her always sweet.
Interesting
risks.
Between the loss of Shae and
Jon Snow's spunky lover Ygritte,
"Game of Thrones" may actually
run out of unconventional and
interesting female characters
before thebook materialruns dry.
Tywin's death was no surprise,
but since he was the instigator of
so much of the Lannister conflict,
I worrythat the show mighthave
offed a crucial catalyst just to add
to the body count.
The fourth season of "Game of
Thrones" took interesting risks,
but with mixed results. Every
episode was punctuated by stun-
ningly directed action sequences
and buckets of carnage, but cheap
gasps don't always make for
groundbreaking television. The
best parts of the season - Arya
and The Hound's fraught friend-
ship, Tyrion's struggle to prove
his innocence, Dany learning
that there's more to being a true
Khaleesi than some cool CGI
dragons - used minimal shock
tactics. "Game of Thrones" may
sit atop the Iron Throne of pres-
tige television for now, but to
remain the nonpareil that it is,
"Thrones" has to step up its game.

TV REVIEW
All 'Bad' things must end

"Say my name"
The TV
phenomenom
concludes in
spectacular fashion
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
ManagingArts Editor
OCT. 3, 2013 - It should go
without saying that the follow-
ing discussion of the "Breaking
Bad" finale
will contain A
information
as to what Breaking Bad
happened in
the "Breaking Series Finale
Bad" finale, AMC
but people
tend to be
particularly sensitive about spoil-
ing with this show, so this is your
very fair, explicit spoiler warning.
"All bad things must come to
an end," declared the AMC pro-
mos for "Breaking Bad" 's "Feli-
na." And for the first time in a
while, we got a series finale that
really did feel like the end. After
two weeks of episodes packed
with tension and horror, "Feli-
na" plays out much more quietly,
replacing the breakneck speed
and instability that defines the
whole series with an almost
dreamlike fluidity.
In the opening scene, Walter
White (Bryan Cranston) - stuck

in a stolen car covered in snow
as red-and-blues swirl around
him in blind pursuit - calls,
earnestly and for the first time,
upon a higher power to take him
home. Keys magically fall into
his lap, and everything that fol-
lows in the extended episode has
a fantastical, unreal haze cover-
ing it that so starkly contrasts
the slashing realness of all that
precedes it.
Walt haunts scenes perfect-
ly framed by Vince Gilligan's
directorial hand. Todd (Jesse
Plemons) and Lydia (Laura Fra-
ser) don't notice him sitting just
feet away in their usual meet-
ing place. After Marie (Betsy
Brandt) calls Skyler (Anna
Gunn) to warn her Walt's back
in towel and probably coming for
her, the camera shifts to reveal
he's already there, hovering. In
a perfect example of how "Bad"
uses sound mixing and other
techniques to set tone, evoke
emotion and even provide narra-
tive to an extent no other show
has accomplished, Walt lurks
in the shadows of Elliot and
Gretchen's (Adam Godley and
Jessica Hecht) home, the silence
and shadows more threatening
than Elliot's tiny knife could
ever confront.
It's a marked change of pace
from the rest of the whiplash-
inducing final season, and the
mostly unsettling series reaches
a surprisingly settled conclu-

sion.
"Felina" 's standout moment
comes not from its most violent
outbursts, but from a quiet con-
fession from Walt to Skyler. "I
did it for me," he cuts her off as
she tells him to stop giving her
bullshit about doing it for the
family. "I was good at it. And I
was really ... I was alive." Most
of us knew Walt's motivations
were never about others (except
for the contingency of the few-
but-loud Team Walt soldiers
insisting he was a Family Man
who lost his way, a victim of
uncontrollable circumstances -
they're, hopefully, eating their
words and then some). But to
hear Heisenberg himself spell it
out and show his true baby-blue
colors - in what's possibly the
only moment of pure honesty
from the character since sea-
son one - satisfies more than
anything else in "Felina." Gunn
(who gives off some serious Car-
mela Soprano vibes with her
physicality - worn but resolved
- in the scene) proves just how
worthy she is of the little golden
statue she won a week earlier,
capturing Skyler's surprise in a
single look.
"Breaking Bad" has always
been immensely punitive, and
while not a religious show, it
often possesses an Old Testa-
ment view of consequences and
justice. "Felina" doles out justice
with machine gun robots and
Stevia packets. Walt built the
legend of Heisenberg on mate-
rial wealth, but as he learns in
"Ozymandias," "Granite State"
and "Felina," money can be
stolen and empires can crum-
ble. With almost everything
stripped away from him, Walt
sets out on a direct path toward
justice, driven by the one thing
he has left, the one thing that
reignites Heisenberg mode:
his pride. Walt's determined
path in "Felina" is not wholly
redemptive, but there is defi-
nitely a sense that what's sup-
posed to happen, well, happens.
Lydia dies at the hands of the
the Chekhovian ricin. The neo-
Nazis get what they deserve in a
Tarantino-esque shootout that
allows for one last Heisenberg-
helmed tech trick. The most tit-

for-tat deliberation comes when
Jesse (Aaron Paul) kills Todd
in a grotesque scene that mir-
rors Walt's strangling of Krazy 8
back in season one.
This season in particular has
been so devastating, so pain-
ful for the characters we care
about: Hank and Marie meet
truly tragic endings, and both
halves of the season overflow
with blood and tears (two of the
periodic symbols that make up
the anagram "Fe-li-na": Iron.
Lithium. Sodium. Blood. Meth.
Tears. Gilligan is a genius/bas-
tard.). The amount of time I've
spent worrying about Jesse
Pinkman over the past five years
baffles even me. I know he's not
a real person and that even if
he were a real person our lives
would almost certainly never
intersect, and yet Jesse's fate
has always been a top concern
of mine. He's "Bad" 's foremost
tragic character for most of the
series, but he finds freedom at
last in "Felina." Jesse's defining
character moment - when he
shoots Gale at the end of season
three - sneaks back in an eerily
similar scene, but this time his
gun points at Walt. The wound-
ed Heisenberg tells him to pull
the trigger, but Jesse's done tak-
ing kill orders from the man,
done beinghis puppet.
Perhaps because of how
accustomed I became to Gilligan
- and every last actor on this
damn show - tearingrelentless-
ly at my heartstrings, I feel oddly
uneasy about how neatly "Bad"
wraps up. It's not a happy end-
ing by any means. It's not even a
just one. Inaperfect, just world,
Hank would live and bring
down the bad guys (or, Marie
would exact revenge herself ...
and then find peace, but mostly
I just wanted Marie to poison
everyone). Brock would have
a mother. Walter Jr. would get
unlimited breakfast food for life.
In a just world, Walt wouldn't
have had the final say or the
power to write his own fate. His
belief that the world owes him
something just because of who
he is, the belief that he's truly
peerless in terms of his intel-
ligence and power, informs all
of his actions. The writers don't

necessarily sympathize with
Walt in the final chapter, but
they do grant him thatsame con-
trol he used to hurt others time
and time again. "Felina" isn't
Walt's apology or his quest for
grace; it's just acceptance. He's
a ghost from the start. Despite
his cancer, Walt always fancied
himself a god, able to outsmart
his enemies at every turn. Or,
more accurately, thinking he can
outsmart them: The show's best
moments are when he under-
estimates those in his way and
overvalues his own abilities -
the most extreme case being
when he thinks he can spare
Hank's life in "Ozymandias."
In "Felina," Walt still has his
noxious pride, but that blinding
sense of immortality evaporates.
Now that we have all of
"Breaking Bad" 's pieces in
front of us, it's easier to point to
the series's highlights. "Phoe-
nix" haunts me to this day.
"Fly" unfolds like a poem, and
proved the series could shine
even when the intensity wasn't
turned up to explosive levels.
"Ozymandias" will go down as
one of the best hours of televi-
sion in our lifetime. "Breaking
Bad" has several cornerstone
episodes, but "Felina" isn't one
of them. It's satisfying, that's for
sure. And it's one of the better
series finales I've seen. But the
same reason it works so well is
the reason I walked away from
the end of "Breaking Bad" a
little disenchanted. For a series
about the moral complexity of
humans, the conclusion is strik-
ingly well defined. Walt receives
a death sentence in the pilot,
and so in the end, he dies. It's a
strangely beautiful (and poetic)
end for a man who embodied
so many ugly things. But that's
what "Breaking Bad" has always
been: a beautiful show about the
wicked. It's full of darkness and
evil, all set against a colorful
backdrop of sunny-bright Albu-
querque. It made me care about
junkies, drug dealers, shoplift-
ers and assholes. I already miss
it, but I also know we'll be talk-
ing about it for years to come.
In that way, I guess Heisen-
berg got what he wanted after
all: an indelible legacy.

COMMUNITY & CULTURE
Students look to'Take Back The RC'

Controversy over
protest-graffiti in
East Quad
By ALEX BERNARD
DailyArts Writer
MARCH 23, 2014 - Late Sun-
day night, a group of students
painted a mural in the basement
of East Quad. They did so without
permission or approval, but with
a very specific vision in mind. In
big bold letters, they wrote "the
WORK OF ART IS A SCREAM
OF FREEDOM - Christo."
Two days later, East Quad
maintenance staff painted over
the mural. That same day, the
Facebook page"Take Back the
RC" was launched.
The page's title references
the 2012-2013 renovations to
East Quad, which have given
the dorms an almost "hotel-like"
atmosphere (blank white walls,
cushy chairs, a law firm-esque
dining hall, etc.). Presently, there
is a zero-tolerance policy for wall
murals at East Quad - but that

may be changing fairly soon.
RC students are pushing for
a return to the old EQ commu-
nity, which was characterized
by underground music venues,
paint-covered walls and a gener-
ally grungy ambiance. Without
a suitable creation space though,
many students believe a suitable
RC is not possible. The Residen-
tial College is in East Quad, but as
of right now, the two might not be
interchangeable.
Sincetheremovalofthe Christo
quote, other murals have sprung
up throughout EQ, presumably in
the middle of the night. Pictures
of the paintings were posted to
the "Take Back the RC" Facebook
page, which has accrued 350+
likes and spurred an email from
Professor Angela Dillard, Director
of the Residential College.
I had a chance to sit down with
the founders of the page and later,
the muralists themselves. (Both
the page founders and the mural-
ists wish to remain anonymous
while the project continues.)
"We wanted to create some-
thing that had the chance to stay
up forever ... The purpose wasn't

just to send a message, it was to
make something that had the
potential to stay there as a piece
of art."
The founders of the "Take Back
the RC" Facebook page explained
that the page wasn't created to
inspire or incite the painting of
murals, but rather to document
them.
"We as a page are not encour-
aging students to do anything. We
really want to avoid encouraging
people to vandalize things," one
said.
The founders said that the
page is about "promoting an envi-
ronment where RC students have
the ability to express themselves
creatively and freely."
According to them, this feeling
has not existed at all in the new
building.
"The housing administration
sees (the new East Quad) as their
shining new object, whereas RC
students see this as more of a
blank canvas."
They mentioned instances of
"completely harmless, complete-
ly removable, completely non-
permanent art that have gone

up around the building." These
pieces were promptly removed,
usually on the same day.
On March 19, just one day after
the launch of "Take Back the
RC," Residential College direc-
tor Angela Dillard sent out an
email to the entire Residential
College (students, staff and fac-
ulty), addressing the murals and
the movement. Notably, Profes-
sor Dillard opened with the line,
"Every work of Art is a scream for
Freedom," which was the quote
included in the first mural.
Dillard addressed the desire
for murals by referencing an
older "Guide to the RC" from the
1970s/'80s. The Guide detailed
the old process for creating
murals in East Quad. The proce-
dure included approval from both
residents and the Housing Coor-
dinator, restrictions on painting
spaces and the requirement that
"only paint can be used." Suffice
to say, this was not a zero toler-
ance policy.
Along with the optimistic
message, Professor Dillard also
addressed the use of murals as a
message.

"We ought to be respectful of
our colleagues in Housing who
are charged with the mainte-
nance of our shared spaces, and
we need to be respectful of each
other ... Further acts, I'm afraid,
will start to look more like van-
dalism and I'm worried about
that dynamic that often seems to
take things too far."
The page founders said that
the '70s and '80s policy outlined
in the email "sounds reasonable,"
saying they'd agree to this pro-
posal if it were proposed during
negotiations.
The students, however,
remarked, that the process
wouldn't be as easy as Dillard
implied in the email.
"She came off asa little bit too
optimistic that we would be able
to easily reach a compromise. I'm
not sure any negotiations that
might occur would be that easy."
They said that the email's
positive tone may simply be an
appeasement method to prevent
other students from painting
future murals. Nevertheless, the
students remained cautiously
optimistic: "If we facilitate an

open conversation ... hopefully
something will be reached that's
going to allow creation to occur
in the way that it did in old East
Quad."
Looking toward the future,
a petition has been released on
the Facebook page detailing the
movement and the its goals. As
signatures are accumulated, the
founders are also in the process of
organizing a group to meet with
Dillard and University Housing
officials.
Likewise, the muralists said
that, while they have ideas, no
murals are planned for the near
future. The artists warned that
more murals would "damage the
trust" between Housing and stu-
dents.
"I don't think anything that
went up unofficially right now
would benefit the cause in any
other way." said one of the artists.
And yet, they too, remained
optimistic about the future of the
RC.
As the founders said, hopefully
in the future "Take Back the RC"
will be changed to "RC Murals."
We'll see.

FESTIVAL REPORT
Electric Forest: Decadent, but not depraved

Going beyond in hell what was happening on the

ManagingArts Editor a music festival!" article. I only

JULY 2, 2014 - "Unlike most that I was wrong. I figured I
of the others. we didn't give a hoot would go to Electric Forest as

a reporter. While my co-edi-
tor Adam covered the music, I
would observe the festivalgoers,
"the real beasts," and report on
their depraved excesses. There
would be me, with my media
bracelet and plaid shirt, furious-
ly jotting down notes, and then
there would be everyone else -
the legions of electro-junkies in
funny hats who eat tabs of acid
like Listerine Strips. I imagined
calling this article "Electric For-

est is Decadent and Depraved."
Most of my preconceptions
were based on rumors about
Electric Forest; that it was much
more than a music festival, that
it had the best people-watching
ever, that it was trippier than
an MGMT video. These rumors
were believable, considering
that Electric Forest takes place
in rural Rothbury, Michigan,
specializes in the relatively
niche genres of jam bands and
electronic music and that the
"forest" is an actual forest, so
decked out with lights, lasers
and shrines that it recalls some-
thing from Alice in Wonderland.
In truth, none of the rumors
turned out to be false. But now
that I've returned from Roth-
bury, and gone over the pages of
notes and hours of recordings I
accumulated during my time at
the festival, I cannot write this
report with my original focus.
Not because I feel the need to
write about the music, even
though it was amazing. Rather,
because I discovered that Elec-
tric Forest is less about the peo-
ple who choose to come than it
is about what this peculiar event
allows those people, including
me, to become.
Electric Forest is not so much
a music festival as it is a four
day act of collective weirdness,
heavily facilitated by the festi-
val organizers and sustained by
a pervasive spirit of community
and non-judgement. I began to
get an idea of this right when
we arrived at the camp grounds.
The actual festival area, the stag-
es and vendors, is located on the
Double JJ Resort, a sort of Wild-
West re-enactment spot heav-

ily repurposed for one weekend
every year. The attendees camp
out in a complex of fields adjacent
to the resort. These fields form a
small city during the weekend,
complete with named streets
and neighborhoods. From my
berth at the corner of "Airstrip"
and "Maple", I gazed out upon
the expanse. Thousands of
parked cars in neat rows, most
with colorful tents next to them,
filled the once-empty space like
a psychedelic Hooverville. These
people were clearly pros - many
tents were adorned with banners
and flagpoles featuring the logos
of the classics: The Grateful
Dead, Bob Marley, Sublime, all
fragrant with years of accumu-
lated incense and ganja.
But it was inside the actu-
al festival, a good ten minute
walk from our campsite, that I
finally encountered the masses
of people. I'd never seen such a
dazzling array of outfits. Some
attendees were dressed in stan-
dard music-festival attire: girls
in Daisy Dukes and flower head-
bands, guys in tank tops and
flat-brims. But they were the
minority. Some men wore top
hats and tight suits like the Mad
Hatter, and some girls wore only
bikini bottoms with fanny-pack
codpieces and painted mari-
juana leaves covering the tips
of their otherwise bare breasts.
Others wore Teletubbie or bear
outfits, or giant Pikachu heads.
One man I passed on Saturday
wore only a Speedo and a small
silver crown fixed to his head at
a rakish angle, while sucking on
a large lollipop. Another was so
adorned with ribbons, beads and
feathers that he resembled an
Aztec god.
But the decadence doesn't
stop there. Many festivalgoers
carry totems, which are long
poles with anything on top.
And I mean anything. Blow-up
sex dolls. Bill Murray's face.
Simpsons characters. I saw one
depicting a cartoon King of
Kings, with a Mr. Skin-esque
grin, and the words "PRAISE
CHEEZUS" in big block let-
ters, likely in honor of the String
Cheese Incident's combined 12
hours of stagetime.
And of course, drugs. They're
an essential part of the festival,
so ubiquitous and accepted that
one pizza vendor put up a sign
that read "DON'T FORM LINES.
LINES ARE FOR YOUR NOSE,
NOT SPICY PIE." I'm watch-
ing Ms. Lauryn Hill and a guy to
my left lights up a joint the size
of a Sharpie. I'm raving along at
Zedd, and a guy to my rightvacu-
ums a good quarter-teaspoon of
coke into his left nostril.
This overwhelming amount
of, well, everything made me
wonder "Is this where all the
weirdos gather? Or is this where
people gather to be weird?"
I've concluded that it's the lat-
ter. Of course, I don't think that
Electric Forest is where Mor-
mon missionaries and Goldman
Sachs executives congregate

to let loose, but I did get the
impression that Electric For-
est provides a safe environment
for ordinary people to abandon
mainstream mores for a week-
end. A guy in a hammock put it
best in a remark to another guy
in the hammock strung below
his: "I'm going hard tomorrow,
because I have to go back to real-
ity after that."
Electric Forest is not only a
retreat from "normalcy," but
also an oasis of kindness and
togetherness. Festivalgoers go
out of their way to accommo-
date each other. One girl entered
a Port-A-Potty after a long wait
in line, only to burst out and run
after the previous occupant who
had dropped a $5 bill. During a
packed performance by Steve
Angello, another girl got tired
and decided to sit down right in
the middle of the crowd. Every-
one, even those wildly dancing
while rolling, made sure to give
her space.
At an event like this, people
make themselves vulnerable by
dressing in shocking and reveal-
ing ways, taking mind-bending
substances, and then walking
around an environment that is
confusing even if sober. To have
a good time requires a level of
trust on everyone's part, that
their fellow attendees will not
take advantage of them, and will
even help them out if need be.
I experienced this trust first-
hand. On Saturday, I was sitting
in the crowd at the Sherwood
stage, vibing to Schoolboy Q
and taking notes. I struck up a
conversation with a couple sit-
ting near me, Nick and Kat from
Louisville. We chatted about
Electric Forest and why people
would come here.
"We're all here for the same
thing: music and good people,"
Nick said.
As a red-shirted security
guard walked around inquiring
whether the numerous people
smoking joints had medical per-
mits, I remarked to Nick that I
didn't usually strike up conver-
sations at concerts.
"But at a place like this you
should never feel like you can't
talk to anybody," he replied. "
You can go up to anybody and be
like'Hey, what's up?'"
At that moment, I saw a friend
about 15 feet away, one who
I hadn't talked to in awhile. I
immediately leapt up and moved
towards her, forgetting that my
phone, backpack and notebook
were still on the ground next
to Nick and Kat. I looked back
anxiously, and they motioned
towards my things and gave me
a thumbs up, indicatingcthat they
would watch over them. Leaving
your stuff with strangers prob-
ably isn't something to make a
habit of. But as Doctor Thomp-
son said, "When the going gets
weird, the weird turn pro." The
going at Electric Forest is defi-
nitely weird - I viewed them
watching my stuff as asmatter of
professional courtesy.

cent lives, so she got involved.
Karmeisool's journey with sex-
ual heath started at The Rain-
bow Connection, Michigan's
version of the Make-A-Wish
Foundation, where she worked
with AIDS-infected adoles-
cents. Eventually, with a little
help from her proud and phil-
anthropic parents, Karmeisool
opened S3.
Though the sale of adult toys
and products are Karmeisool's
means of stayingin business, she
is adamant that a commitment to
promoting sexual health comes
first. In fact, under especially
difficult circumstances she has
gone as far as giving away con-
doms and products to people
who could not afford them. She
even went back for her Masters
in Public Health after opening
S3 to reinforce her commitment
to the store's mission, which was
always to provide "consistent
and correct information about
sexual health, but do it in a way
that was open, normalizing sex,
reducing stigma and making
the store available to all people
regardless of age, race, sexual
orientation, economic standing,
religious values." It's crucial to
Karmeisool that customers at S3
can ask any employee personal
questions without feeling judg-
ment, and get information that
will improve their lives.
To ensure that this approach
to customer service stays con-
sistent, S3's hiring process is
extremely rigorous and selec-
tive. According to Karmeisool,
each applicant must have pre-
vious experience with sexual
health and education before
they are even considered for
a position. Also, because the
store's employees are a close-
knit team, each applicant must
be interviewed and approved
by everyone who works there.
If any worker has a bad feeling
about an applicant like if they
hesitated on the issues of trans-
gendered people, or other non-
normative lifestyles - they're

EVENT PREVIEW
David Sedarns to speak at Literati

Famed author and
humorist comes to
A to give reading
and sign books
By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
ManagingArts Editor
JUNE 10, 2014 - Hold onto
your moleskins: David Sedaris
is coming to town.
The famed essayist and
comedian, and author of works
such as "Dress Your Family in
Corduroy and Denim" and his
latest essay collection "Let's
Explore Diabetes with Owls,"
will be appearing at Literati
Bookstore Wednesday night.
Since he read his humor-

ous essay "SantaLand Dia-
ries," about working as an elf at
Macy's, on NPR in 1992, Sedaris
has become perhaps the preemi-
nent humorist in America today,
one whose essays, radio broad-
casts and speaking events have
earned him numerous fans.
Sedaris' writing is unique in
that he finds remarkable ele-
ments in very unremarkable sit-
uations. His stories aren't about
exotic adventure and intrigue,
but rather mundane elements
of his own life, from Hallow-
een ("Us and Them") to flying
to Paris ("Journey into Night").
But because of his wit and tone
(nebbishy but wise), he brings
out the absurd humor and unex-
pected lessons of these stories.
Sedaris is a raconteur - he
excels at telling stories, par-

ticularly funny ones, which has
made him immensely popular
as a public speaker.
"I find that if I conscious-
ly try to be funny it always
seems forced," Sedaris said in
an e-mail exchange with The
Michigan Daily. "Rather, I try
to be entertaining. I think of
how the story might sound out
loud to an audience and I pro-
ceed accordingly."
Sedaris often discusses
transgressive subjects - one
essay, "Full House," recalls a
game of strip poker in the sixth
grade where a still-closeted
David revels in witnessing the
bare bodies of his male friends,
one of whom he eventually con-
vinces to sit on his lap. But even
with his frank discussions of
sexuality, drug use and cancer,

he has such widespread appeal
that his essays are taught in
high schools. Sedaris himself
is rather blase about the whole
matter.
"I've never thought of myself
as particularly subversive," he
said. "If my essays are in English
classes perhaps ithas more to do
with the writing than the topic.
The New Yorker puts an odd
stamp of approval on things."
Tickets to the reading
became available on June 3, to
those who purchased a copy
of Mr. Sedaris' latest book and
sold out within an hour. But
the book signing is open to the
public and will go on as long as
there are eager fans in line
"From the sound of it, he's the
most accommodating human
being on planet earth," said

John Ganiard, Events Coordi-
nator at Literati Bookstore.
It's no surprise that for his
visit to Ann Arbor, Mr. Sedaris
chose Literati. Since opening in
April2013, the East Washington
store has become a cultural hot-
spot, with its regular hosting of
authors and open-mic nights.
"Since we opened, it's been
our mission to bring notable
authors to our space, which is
an intimate space, because we
serve the community beyond
just being a general bookstore,"
Ganiard said.
Sedaris is popular with all
ages, but high school and col-
lege students seem to respond
particularly well to his writ-
ings, and they flock to readings
like these with as much enthu-
siasm as if they were meeting a

favorite musician or actor. Per-
haps it is because Sedaris sim-
ply makes writing seem fun.
"Especially as a teenager, you
think of writing as something
you're forced to do in school,
and then watching someone do
it, and making you laugh, your
first thought is "I want to do
that," Ganiard said.
Sedaris doesn't harbor any
fantasies that his books will
keep people, including teenag-
ers, reading.
"Goodness no. If anything,
it's pornography that will keep
people reading," he said.
But he does have some advice
for those, attending or not, who
aspire to be writers.
"My advice is to write every-
day (with a pen that's shaped
like a candy cane)."

Pride Night at Necto: Asafer space

Popular nightclub
provides a
gay-friendly
environment
By NATALIE GADBOIS
Senior Arts Editor
FEB. 12,2014 - We're allfamil-
iar with straight spaces, even if
we don't know the term. The frat
parties, where a combination of
Heaven Hill and Drake creates
the assumption that any boy can
grind up against any girl. College
bars, where ladies pay half price
for shots on Thursday nights, the
owners finding ways to make girls
"loose," and ways to entice the
men to show up.
Houseparties,socialcirclesand
evenclassrooms;somanyfunction
under the assumption that unless
you say otherwise, you're straight,
and that's that. These pervasive
straight spaces are what made the
idea of spending a Friday at Pride
Night at Necto nightclub all the
more intriguing - and, to be hon-
est, alittle disconcerting.
The getting ready process was
the same - dashing on make-up,
confirming with my roommate
that my outfit was the perfect
combination of cute and edgy,

consuming fiery substances from
chipped Costa Rican shot glasses
- but the destination was so dif-
ferent fromwhat Iknew.
Pride Night was started in 1984
and has remained a nightlife fix-
ture in the gay community in Ann
Arbor since then, voted, multiple
times as the best gay club in the
Metro Detroit area. The large club,
located on East Liberty, has two
dance rooms, both with live DJs,
with the famous Red Room down-
stairs playing retro-pop hits with
accompanying videos - mainly
Beyonce and '80s dance-pop the
night I was there.
The crowd is filled with close-
ly dancing couples, the gender
composition more heavily male
than any party I had ever been to
before. Both rooms feature acces-
sible stages and stripper poles,
which guests are encouraged to
hop onto.
Necto touts itself as the place
to be on a Friday night for the gay
community, an association that
comes with some complexities
and some questions. How do you
define a safe space for gays? And
once defined, how do you success-
fully construct that space?
. LSA junior Schuyler Robin-
son believes that a "gay space" is
"a place kind of free of judgment,
because as gay people we some-
times deal with stigma and feel

judged solely by being ourselves."
Robinson argues that while
Necto is a fun place, somewhere
to dance and let loose, it isn't the
inclusive safe space it can be rep-
resented as. He has seen straight
female friends be harassed and
targeted with language that dis-
criminates them just as props for
their gay friends. In an effort to
classify Pride Night as a common
ground for the gay community,
sometimes other identities can
become marginalized.
"Because people feel so com-
fortable and so non-targeted, they
almost feel like their words aren't
accountable," Robinson said.
"Because they are in their space,
they are not the minority there."
Similarly, LSA senior Taylor
Portela, a volunteer at the Spec-
trum Center, agrees that Necto is
the best place to go dance, but is
waryto define it as asafe space.
"Necto is a beautiful, terrify-
ing place," Portela said. "It is a gay
space, but at the same time it's a
gay space with a twist, so when I
bring women of any orientation
and identity they still are actively
harassed."
Portela defines the distinction
between a gay space and a queer
space, holding that gay spaces
are often dominated by gay white
males, while queer spaces are
more inclusive of women and

racial minorities. Pride Night, he
argues, is distinctly a gay space -
an unfortunate limitation for the
club.
"At Necto there are just a ton of
white cisgenders; gay white men,
dancing and doing their thing -
which is fine. It's good. I mean,
I am one of them," Portela said.
"But at the same time my friends
of color get harassed, women get
harassed..."
Neither Portela nor Robinson
believes that Necto necessarily
promotes healthy connections in
a way safe spaces ought to. The
pounding music and dark rooms
make conversation difficult, so the
club becomes marked as the hook-
up place - though he's gone many
nights, Robinson can't recall ever
making a real friend or fostering a
relationship with someone he met
atNecto.
"You walk in (and) there's
music, its dark - it's not so condu-
cive to welcoming people."
"It's like the gay version of
Rick's," Portela said.
Rick's: an Ann Arbor bastion
of drunken hookups and texts-
from-last-night anecdotes. But
is it problematic when the pre-
dominant nighttime gay space in
Ann Arbor promotes that culture?
Though they reiterate that Necto
is a fun space (a statement I agree
with entirely), at times itsfrenetic,

hyper-sexualized atmosphere can
perpetuate limiting stereotypes
about the gay community.
"(Necto) feeds into the stereo-
type that gay people are obsessed
with bodies, about putting out a
good self-image rather than trying
to connect with someone," Robin-
son said.
Portela affirms this, but doesn't
think this depiction of gay culture
iswhollynegative.
"Gay culture is very much
built around some stereotypes,
yes, but part of gay culture - gay
white male culture - is having
song-tunes and Whitney Hous-
ton playing in the background,
the '80s synth pop blast really
loud," he said. "While (Necto) is
affirming of some stereotypes,
it points toward a larger gay cul-
ture, like the club culture that is
in this atmosphere." Both men
were excited about the opening
of a new gay night in town, Candy
Bar, located at Live Nightclub.
The event premiered last Thurs-
day, and Robinson and Portela
each hailed it as a more inclusive
but still fun environment. On
opening night, Candy Bar had a
host and DJs, and featured a drag
queen performance from former
contestants on the reality show
"RuPaul's Drag Race."
"(Candy Bar is a) much better
space, because at Necto you can't

hear anyone, so I think people
can connect more and get to know
each other better at that space,"
Robinson said. "And it was really
fun. The DJ played great music,
all the attitudes just seemed much
more positive."
Though Candy Bar only hosted
its inaugural night a week ago,
Portela finds the combination of
this event with Necto to be prom-
ising for Ann Arbor's gay and
queer community.
"I really like the set up of Live,
so that was, atmosphere-wise,
veryenjoyable,"Portelasaid."(It's)
a really nice space because it was
people of more than just one or
two identities who filled theaspace,
and I didn't hear afterwards of any
real threatening or harassment
going on."
With the induction of Candy
Bar, Ann Arbor is growing as
a destination for gay nightlife
scenes, a relief for students
who currently feel limited in
predominantly straight spaces,
However, the complexity behind
Necto proves that just the con-
struction of a gay space is not
enough - an inclusive environ-
ment comes from the clientee
and the set up of the space itself.
But wherever you choose to go,
it's Friday night, it's -20 degrees
out, and everyone just wants to
have fun.

well before anyone else. Glenn
Robinson III gives a quick wave
to the crowd and puts his head
down. Nik Stauskas is emotion-
less. Mitch McGary, who was
never getting into the game,
walks off wearing the uniform
his teammates have insisted he
wear.
Later, Morgan, held up by
his press conference, is one of
the last to enter the Michigan
locker room. Most of the room is
composed except for Zak Irvin,
who is emotional in one corner
of the room, and for Morgan. He
wipes his face with his sleeve
and cries in front of the televi-
sion cameras.
His teammates have said
the loss is all the more difficult
because it means they'll never
play another game with Mor-
gan. The senior doesn't know
how to respond.
He pauses to wipe his eyes.

anyone anticipated. With-
out Trey Burke, without
Tim Hardaway Jr., without
McGary, this team didn't just
win the Big Ten. It dominated.
It improved, steadily, each
game. The pieces, especially
offensively, meshed seamlessly.
A photo comes to mind now
from the summer of 2012. The
Michigan basketball team's
incoming class is posingtogeth-

pockets and smiles big. McGary
looks like akid atsummer camp.
Stauskas stands at the edge and
looks moody.
College basketball today
is brutal in this regard. Jor-
dan Morgans are rare. Play as
well as Michigan has and you
risk losing your best players. A
two-year-old photo feels like
a sepia-toned memory. Almost
certainly, some of those players
will be gone next year.

It's unclear what Michigan
could have done better. A few
more box outs, maybe. Less foul

But Michigan played at just

It was hard to ask much more
from this team in this game,
this season. Michigan's big men,
simply, weren't big. Kentucky
was too much to handle above
the rim. The final six minutes
on Sunday were the best bas-

Michigan takes a timeout,

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
Mikulak,
'M'repeat
as national
champs
By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
APRIL 11, 2014 - The word
'perfect' is almost never men-
tioned in gymnastics, a sport
that adheres countless deduc-
tions to the smallest of errors, but
the Michigan men's gymnastics
team's performance Friday night
came pretty darn close.
After finishing the regular
season undefeated and then win-
ning the Big Ten championship,
the second-ranked Wolverines
wrapped up their perfect season
by winning the-National Cham-
pionship with a score of 445.050.
Competing at home in the Crisler
Center, Michigan edged out
second-place Oklahoma and
third-place Stanford to reach the
pinnacle of collegiate gymnastics
for a second straight year.
The Wolverines earned the
first repeat national champion-
ship in school history since the
trampoline program did so in
1969-1970. Friday also marked
the third championship in five
years for Michigan, and its sixth
all time.
"It just doesn't get any better
than winning it at home," said
Michigan coach Kurt Golder.
"And this is my fourth one, and
they are all great, but winning it
in front of a Michigan crowd in
Crisler Center. And then it being
a repeat, it just makes it all the
sweeter. I couldn't ask for any-
thing more."
In addition to winning back-
to-back team championships,
senior Sam Mikulak also took
home back-to-back all-around
titles, with a total score of 91.10.
Mikulak had the highest score in
three out of the six events on the
night, highlighted by his perfor-
mapnces on parallel bars and floor
exrcise.
His individual title, the sixth
individual championship of his
career, leaves him only two short
of holding the most individual
championships in NCAA history
ahead of Saturday's competition.
Though starting the competi-
tion on one of the hardest events
- pommel horse - the Wolver-
ines took the early lead and never
looked back. Mikulak paced
Michigan with a score of 15.600
in the event - good enough to tie
for first. Michigan also got a pair
of 14.950s from junior Nick Hunt-
er and senior Matt Freeman on its
wayto atotal score of 75.100.
"Pommel horse is the most
difficult event to perform on,"
Golder said. "But I have a lot of
confidence in this team. That's
actually our most consistent
event, and that's very rare. So if
you go out and start on pommel
horse and hit like we did, it takes
the pressure off."
Added Mikulak: "We have a

FOOTBALL
An early look at Doug
Nussmeier s offense

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
APRIL 5, 2014 - Michigan
football's biggest story this
spring, sans the offensive line,
has been the rebuilding of its
offense. The chief signing this
offseason wasn't the No. 3 over-
all prospect in defensive back
Jabrill Peppers, but it was for-
mer Alabama offensive coordi-
nator Doug Nussmeier.
So, when Michigan held its
Spring Game on Saturday, fans
and media alike came to watch
the offense, and whatever
magic Nussmeier could bring
from Tuscaloosa,Alabama.
"All I can say is (Nussmeier's)
done an excellent job in teach-
ing (the new offense)," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
"Obviously, he's here because
we think he's an awfully good
football coach in all areas....
(But) room for improvement?
Oh my gosh, there's no question,
we need alot of improvement -
but the way it's being taught has

been real positive."
As Hoke has been saying
since practice began a few
weeks ago, only remedial plays
would be unveiled to the public
this spring. And the fourth-year
coach was telling the truth, as
most of what the Wolverines
showed Saturday was "vanilla,"
as quarterback Devin Gardner
called it.
The "vanilla" offense kicked
off with a less-than-inspiring
pass from Gardner, who was
looking for freshman receiver
Freddy Canteen on a fly route
but was intercepted by sopho-
more Jourdan Lewis. It was
Gardner's first pass in front of
fans since the Ohio State game
last November.
Before the scrimmage began,
though, all eyes were on the
offensive line and running back
drills. Freshman Mason Cole
practiced with the first team at
the starting left tackle position,
and redshirt junior Jack Miller
started at center, but both could
be bumped once redshirt soph-

omore Erik Magnuson and red-
shirt junior Graham Glasgow
return from injury and suspen-
sion, respectively. Cole did an
admirable job against Frank
Clark, and only a few members
of the line gave up would-be
sacks - a vast improvement
from last season.
But even during preliminary
drills, the running backs strug-
gled to break through the line.
The only time they were able to
consistently generate positive
yardage was when the defensive
line was replaced with a plastic
strip.
And once the team began
scrimmaging an hour into the
event, the defensive line con-
sistently stuffed the backs. The
longest run of the afternoon
came from sophomore Derrick
Green, and it was for just eight
yards. The backs had the most
success when they ran to the
outside, avoiding work between
the tackles - illustrating once

A dizzying, brilliant,
mesmerizing death

FOOTBALL
Athletic Department
announces new 2014
student seating policy

NOVEMBER 30.,2013-
If it was a death, it was
a mesmerizing death.
It was an end fitting for a game
that somehow made everyone
believe again.
Brady
Hoke went
for it. He
didn't have '
to, and he
even had a
chance to
change his ZACH
mind. Michi- HELFAND
gan lined up
for a two-
point conver-
sion to win the game. Ohio State
coach Urban Meyer called a
timeout. Hoke polled his seniors
in the huddle. They all said to
go for it.
It was a mesmerizing, bril-
liant death, but that doesn't ease
the pain, not for Devin Gardner,
who was so despondent after the
42-41 loss to Ohio State, with his
helmet pulled low over his face,
that he needed Kevin Koger to
escort him as he meandered in
a daze off the field, and then
sobbed so loudly it echoed down
Michigan's tunnel. His pain was
raw and endearing and real.
It didn't ease the pain for
Hoke, whose eyes were as red as
the thousands of Buckeye fans
in the Big House. They had come
expecting a rout, snatching tick-
ets from Michigan fans who had
long ago abandoned hope.
It didn't ease the pain for Tay-
lor Lewan, the fifth-year senior
offensive tackle, who nearly
choked up during his press con-
ference.
"I love every single one of
these guys," said Lewan, whose
last play at Michigan Stadium
was the most wrenching. His
voiced wavered. He turned to
Jake Ryan and tapped Ryan's
arm with his fist. "He's my best
friend."
Hoke went for it, because "we
wanted to go win the football
game," he said, and good for
him. The walls have been clos-

New format
replaces general
admission, rewards
attendance
By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
MARCH 11, 2014 - General
admission is no more.
Tuesday afternoon,
Central Student Government
announced a revamped policy
for student seating at home
football

to form seating groups of up to
100 people. This fall, a group
will sit closest to the field if
they are all SuperFans and
will otherwise be placed via
seniority; in following years, it
will be determined by taking
an average of the attendance
points of the grdup members
from the prior season.
Football season tickets this
fall will cost $280 with a $15
service fee, matching prices
from last year. Both seasons
feature seven home contests.

Devin Gardner scored five total touchdowns against Ohio State, but the Wolverines fell one two-point conversion short.

ing in during this nightmare of a
month. The team has underper-
formed - regressed even - and
some have called for Hoke's job,
or the job of his offensive coor-
dinator or that of his offensive
line coach. Michigan Athletic
Director Dave Brandon had to
issue a statement of support for
Hoke on Wednesday. The star
recruit chose the other team and
another said he might reconsider
Michigan. Why? He's worried
about Hoke's job. But Hoke went
for it.
It was a rub route, the same
one they practiced this week.
Gardner in the shotgun, with
Devin Funchess, Jeremy Gal-
lon and Drew Dileo stacked to
his right. Funchess ran a post,
Gallon an out. It was supposed
to create space for Dileo, the
little, sure-handed receiver who
always seems to be forgotten
until the biggest moments. Dileo
would surely make the catch,
because he always does.
But Tyvis Powell jumped the
route. Dileo never had a chance.
"I threw an interception to
lose the game," said Gardner,
who put his chin on his fist in
his press conference. He hardly

spoke above a mumble. "There's
not really much else I can say."
After the pass, Gardner
crumpled to the ground, spent.
He stayed there, his arms and
legs extended out. That's what
you'll remember, because that's
the image that will last. This
one hurts just like the loss
last year, maybe even more. A
win wouldn't have cured the
offensive line or erased any
losses. But it would've helped a
lot. Itwould've erased some of
the sting from a disappointing
season. It would've put to rest
any coaching rumors. So, yes,
you'll remember Gardner on
tie ground, because that's what
matters, but don't forget the rest.
Don't forget how it made you
believe, and Hoke too. It was a
painful end, but Michigan lived
it well.
Maybe you allowed yourself
to think this will be a game after
all, after the screen to Gallon on
the first drive. The fight, Hoke
running out to separate his play-
ers, the punches and the double
middle fingers made it personal.
Hoke went for it because he
wanted it as bad as his players.
He wanted it as bad as Gardner,

who threw a touchdown pass
to Dileo down 14 in the fourth
quarter. Afterward, Gardner
tried to run off the field, limping
so badly he nearly fell over on
the sideline. Taylor Lewan came
off limping after that play too,
and bloody again. Most of these
players are playing through inju-
ry because they don't care how
many losses they have. They just
want to beat Ohio State.
By the time Carlos Hyde
fumbled, and the clock showed
plenty of time, and Gardner
was fighting with everything he
had left and the breaks started
turning Michigan's way, a ripple
went through the stadium.
Then Jake Butt scored and
then Funchess, and then the
timeout and it seemed like des-
tiny.
It was a hell of a death, but it
was a hell of a game too, right up
until the end. For the best three
hours of the year, 7-4 Michigan
was on top of the world.
So Hoke went for it. It was
ballsy, and it was risky, and it
didn't work out. But that's what
you do when what you want is
right there to take.
You go for it. You go for it

Michael
Proppe, CSG president, and
Public Policy junior Bobby
Dishell, CSG vice president,
worked closely. with the
Athletic Department on the
changes. The result, Proppe
said, is "the best of both
worlds."
Under the new policy, an
individual's accumulated
attendance points this fall will
be the sole determinant of his
or her seat location in 2015.
Students will earn three points
for attending a game and can
collect three more if they arrive
at least 30 minutes before
kickoff. That pattern will
continue for the foreseeable
future, with seat location
assigned via the individual's
points from the previous year
only.
This fall will be a transition
season, in which seats will
be assigned in the following
order: Students who attended
at least five home games
on time in 2013 are deemed
"SuperFans" and will sit
closest to the field in order of
seniority, and those who did
not will be behind them based
solely on seniority.
The attendance points
accumulated this season will
be tallied automatically when
tickets are scanned upon
entering Michigan Stadium.
The new reserved ticketing
format will also allow students

CSG and
the Athletic Department have
been meeting regularly since
September 2013 to assess
the now-scrapped general
admission policy. On-time
attendance increased in 2013,
according to Proppe, but "the
effect was negligible" and
"did not achieve the Athletic
Department's goals" of having
a full student section at kickoff.
A survey conducted by CSG
released Oct. 16 revealed that
76 percent of respondents
said they were opposed to
general admission, with many
indicating their displeasure
at not being able to form
reserved groups to sit with
friends. Seventy-seven percent
indicated that they preferred
the policy in previous years, in
which seating was assigned and
determined by credit hours.
But Proppe believes the
new policy, which will ignore
seniority after 2014 and focus
on rewarding attendance, will
make students happy.
"Students are getting the
main things they wanted, and
the Athletic Department is
getting what they wanted," he
said. "Some of the nightmare
of general admission will be
over."

"Obviously we're missing some
pieces (on the line), but I feel like
they're playing well," Gardner
said. "It's hard to continue to stop

APRIL 6, 2014 - Of the Michi-
gan men's basketball team's fresh-
men last year, each saw important
minutes and had big moments.
Two of this year'sthree freshmen
did too.
Then there's Mark Donnal. The
6-foot-9 freshman from Mon-
clova, Ohio was redshirted and
rode the bench as his teammates
moved the Elite Eight.
Eventhewalk-ons that entered
blowouts late in the game became
more recognizable than Donnal,
the four-star recruit who flashed
a dynamic inside-outside game in
high school.
The 240-pound newcomer is
reticent and soft-spoken, and if
there were character traits that
would keep him from blooming
into a well-adjusted, productive
freshman, those were a few of
them.
"Coming in, I was a little
timid," Donnal said.
The lack of assertiveness and
the slow learning curve were
enough for Michigan coach John
Beilein to tag Donnal with the
"redshirt candidate" label early in.
the season. In a December victory
over Stanford, fifth-year senior
Jordan Morgan and redshirt
junior Jon Horford both fouled
out. Six-foot-six sophomore Glenn
Robinson III had to play the '5'
in the final possessions, and yet,
burning Donnal's redshirt never
crossed Beilein's mind.
That was the last game before
sophomore Mitch McGary was
ruled out with his back injury,
and so it would be just Morgan,
Horford and a dash of redshirt
sophomore Max Bielfeldt in the
frontcourt the rest of the season.
Donnal said the possibility
of a redshirt was never brought

up when Beilein recruited him,
yet, it still lingered in the back
of Donnal's mind. When Beilein
broached it to him early this sea-
son, he marketed the plan as a
chance to bulk up (he gained 10
to 15 pounds this year), become
stronger and get to learn the
offense.
It sounds nice enough, but that
also meant spending the season
watching from the bench, down
on the opposite end from Beilein,
where the guys who wouldn't be
of service onagiveneveningwere
placed. It was something Donnal
never had to do. It was tough for
him, but he knew there was noth-
ing to do but soak in information.
"Jordan, especially defensively,
just going up against him, I'm
learning from what he's doing
when he's playing against me,"
Donnal said.
Donnal was on the scout team
this season, and by seeing the
angles and nuances Morgan and
Horford played with in practice,
he was able to absorb the new
concepts.
"He's still learning the ins and
outs of the game," Morgan said. "I
don't even remember what Iknew
in high school, but he's learning."
Donnal's not sure when exactly
it was, just that it came around the
middle of the regular season, but
he turned a corner. He'd found
success against Morgan and Hor-
ford enough in practice that he
knewhe belonged.
"I started to pick up every-
thing, and my game started to
come back to me, and I'm getting
in the flow of the college game,"
Donnal said.
If it wasn't for the redshirt,
Morgan and Horford might have
had to worry abouttheir job secu-
rity.
"Over the past couple months,
he's just become really good.

Really dominates, shoots the ball
well."
The tentativeness that plagued
Donnal through the season's first
couple months seemed to disap-
pear.
"Now that I have my confi-
dence back, I know that Ican play
with these guys," Donnal said.
The hallmark '5' of the John
Beilein offense is a guy that can
hang with the best big men under
the rim, but also take hisdefender
outside to shoot the 3-pointer.
West Virginia sensation Kevin
Pittsnogle was the paradigm for
the type of player Beilein wanted
at that position.
But since he came to Michigan,
Beilein's '5' has looked less like
Pittsnogle and more like, well,
Morgan. The outside shot has
never been a threat from Beilein's
center in his Michigan days.
With Donnal, though, that
might change.
"He's told me that he's excited
to have a big man that can shoot
threes," Donnal said.
In a 10-minute open practice
at Lucas Oil Stadium a day before
Michigan's Sweet 16 bout against
Tennessee, Donnal showed fans
for the first time - outside of pre-
game warmups - what he could
do.
He had the most fluid jump
shot of Michigan's big men, he
finished around the rim with both
hands and he had perhaps the
most polished post game behind
Mitch McGary.
Asked if he's thought about
what the team might look like if
Donnal was on the court late this
year, Morgan sidestepped the
question, but made a point with
authority.
"I think about next year," he
said. "I think he's gonna make a
really big difference for this team
next year."

All that's left is hope

Zach Nagelvoort saved 63 shots in the BigTen Tournament against Penn State, but his effort wasn't enough.
Hockey falls short
NCAA Touramen

Loss to Penn State
makes 'M' first
team out
By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
MARCH 23, 2014 - Sitting at
the podium Thursday evening in
St. Paul, Minn., Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson answered
questions from the media, his face
illuminated by two spotlights,
eyes glassy.
With your resume as it stands
right now, do you think you get
into the NCAA Tournament?
"Some people look at it right
now and they'll say we've fallen
down to wherever we've fallen,"
he said. "I'm not one of those."
Instead, he said, the Wolver-
ines had been focused on the one
game they could have controlled,
a first-round loss to Penn State in
the Big Ten Tournament.
But on Selection Sunday,
Berenson didn't have to specu-
late about the immediate future.
Michigan finished 15th in the
PairWise rankings, missing out

on the NCAA Tournament for a
second straight year and start-
ing a new streak after snapping a
22-year-long one.
"There was still a glimmer of
hope, but we didn't deserve it,"
Berenson said Sunday. "I feel
worse this year. Last year was the
end of an era - Michigan had had
a lot of momentum getting into
the tournament and maybe being
a regular in the tournament was
taken for granted - but last year
it wasn't even close ... This should
have been a bounce-back year."
Saturday, the Wolverines held
their breath - some monitoring
Twitter, the others streaming the
game online - as Western Michi-
gan took on North Dakota in the
North Central Hockey Confer-
ence consolation game. They
rooted for the Broncos, who had
bested them in the Great Lakes
Invitational nearly four months
prior, even if they didn't check the
score until the bitter end.
"Some guys watched the game,
other guys couldn't watch the
game," said senior defenseman
Mac Bennett. "Eventually every-
one looked on (the website) and
realized what was happening.

When (North Dakota) wins that
game, that's it."
The game was one of three
Michigan needed to end in its
favor in order to secure a spot in
the NCAA Tournament. When
the buzzer sounded and the
scoreboard read 5-0 in favor of
North Dakota, Michigan's season
all but ended. Denver, which won
the NCHC, took the 15th Pair-
Wise slot from the Wolverines
with its automatic bid.
"That game was more impor-
tant to North Dakota than West-
ern Michigan," Berenson said. "I
can't blame them. We're in our
situation because of us."
Michigan became the first
team out.
Sunday, Berenson held a
glass mug of black coffee as he
answered questions about the
official end of the season, his pre-
dictions for the next few weeks
and the next year.
He smiled when reporters asked
if he would be back for another
season. The could've, would've,
should've of the weekend aside, he
was certain of one thing.
"Oh yeah, I'm back," Berenson
said. "One year at a time."

Three
members
of the Penn State hockey team
looked ahead at the locker room
they were preparing to enter.
Nearly 15 fans leaned over the
railing to congratulate their
team.
Sophomore forward Andrew
Copp looked into the near-
empty stands while freshman
forward Tyler Motte fixed his
gaze on the ice.
But Nagelvoort glanced up,
first to the shot line from 92:47
of hockey that just played out.
Flashed across the board, he
read 65-53 in favor of the Nit-
tany Lions. He looked up just a
bit further, for a brief moment,
to read the losing score: 2-1.
Four minutes ago, Nagelvoort
dropped to his knees and hung
his head. He didn't turn to look
for the puck. He hadn't seen it
get past him anyhow.
Within seconds, Nagelvoort
was swarmed by his teammates
around the net. Sophomore net-
minder Steve Racine tapped him
on the head and the 12th-ranked
Wolverines huddled around
him until he disappeared into a
hypno wheel of maize and blue.
For what could be the last
time this season, Michigan
shook hands before Nagelvoort
went to his spot just five feet
away from the exit to the locker
room. The seats all but cleared,

The walk of

MAY 24, 2014, TALLA-
HASSEE, Fla. - By
the time Florida State
rushed the field to celebrate its
Women's College World Series
berth, there was nothing more
Michigan could do.
Courtney Senas, the
Seminoles'
lightning-rod
center fielder
from Wahiawa, BULTMAN
Hawaii, hit On Softball
a two-run
walk-off home
run, and there was no bringing
it back. Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins always asks her team
to keep fighting, but now there
were no more battles to fight.
All that was left for the Wol-
verines to do was watch Senas
leap in the air before touching
first, then see her move into a
dead sprint toward home, then
try to collect themselves walk-
ing off the field for the toughest
moments in all of sports.

When a season ends, inevi-
tably, so does a career, or two,
or six.
For outfielders Lyndsay Doyle
and Nicole Sappingfield, Senas'
home run meantthey would
never again start the game in the
outfield, where they've played
together for their entire careers.
For designated player Taylor
Hasselbach, no more home runs
that make everyone in the stadi-
um wonder how she didn't play
more often early in her career.
For first baseman Caitlin
Blanchard, she was now just
an alumnus of the program she
has followed since long before
Hutchins invited her to be a
part of it. To Brandi Virgil, the
two-run shot meant her days
pinch-running were done, and
for Katie Luetkens, it was time
to christen a new leader of The
Bench Mob.
Looking back, Hasselbach
had her chances with the bases
loaded. Virgil could have been

called safe on a tag at home in
the fifth inning, and Blanchard
was stuck watching from third
in the seventh.
But that wasn't important
once reality sunk in. Hutchins
said she was proud of her team's
heart, and she meant it.
No one outside the program
knows what Hutchins said in
the huddle she called while the
Seminoles jumped up and down
around home plate, then rolled
around on the infield dirt, then
ran around screaming and hug-
ging. But you can bet it involved
the word "pride."
After all, they had done
everything she's preached since
day one.
They played the game pitch
by pitch, like Hasselbach and
Doyle did last week with their
unthinkable plays to beatArizo-
na State. They did their part, like
Virgil when she came into nearly
every game to pinch run, then
left each one without protest.

Sappingfield played through the
flu in 100-degree weather.
It was understandable, then,
for Hutchins to get a little
choked up when asked to reflect
on her senior group.
"It's tough," Hutchins said.
"It's tough to say goodbye."
The Wolverines have plenty
of returningltalent, and even
more in the incoming recruiting
class. They could very well make
another run next year behind
sophomore shortstop Sierra
Romero and the same pitching
staff of juniors Haylie Wagner
and Sara Driesenga and fresh-
man Megan Betsa.
But right now, it's hard to
imagine any of that without
Sappingfield, Doyle, Blanchard,
Hasselbach, Virgil or Luetkens.
In college sports, it's still
about winning with the people
you want to win with. Some-
times it's about walking away
together when there's nothing
left to do.

Men's swim wins fourth straight title

Wolverines take
Big Ten at home in
landslide
By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
MARCH 2, 2014 - When
the officials of the Big Ten
Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionships began handing out
All-Conference awards, Mike
Bottom took his shoes off.
For the fourth straight sea-
son, the world-renowned Michi-
gan swimming coach was about
to take a celebratory dive into
the pool. Bottom, who is in his
sixth season with the team, has
won five Big Ten championships
in his tenure.
This one, though, brought a
new twist to the celebration - a
home crowd.
The No. 2 Michigan men's
swimming and diving team (6-0
Big Ten, 9-0 overall) earned the
applause Saturday at Canham
Natatorium, finishing off a four-
day championship weekend that
saw the Wolverines accumulate
889 total points - 325 more than
runner-up Indiana.
"What it means is to see the
happy - I mean, look at the
fans," Bottom said, stopping to
gesture to a wall of parents, stu-
dents and alumni singing 'The
Victors' in the bleachers. "That's
a world of difference in what
we're doing."
Added senior Connor Jaeger:
"How many hours a week do I
spend here? This is my home. It's
so sentimental that my last swim
senior year ends with being
able to celebrate with the home
crowd and the whole team here."
Michigan was dominant
throughout the weekend, break-
ing school, pool and conference
records along the way. Eleven
of its athletes were named first-
team All-Big Ten.
The Wolverines' team of Jae-
ger, sophomore Anders Nielsen,
junior Justin Glanda and senior
Michael Wynalda began the
excitement Wednesday, setting
a new NCAA record in the 800-
yard freestyle relay. The qartet
finished in 6:09.85, beating the
old record by .25 seconds.
The record-setting per-
formance came just after
Michigan's first win of the
meet - the 200-yard medley
relay - in which senior John
Wojciechowski, sophomore
Peter Brumm and juniors Rich-
ard Funk and Bruno Ortiz won
in 1:24.38.
While the speedy relay times
were impressive, they were some-
what expected. The Wolverines
have arguably the best distance
corps in the nation and are the
reigning national champions in
the 200-yard medley relay.
Less expected, though, was
the standout showing by sopho-
more Timothy Faerber on the
diving board. Faerber became
the first Michigan diver in 11
years to score in all three div-
ing events - the one- and three-
meter diving boards, and the
nlatform dive. Oualifvine eiehth

in all three disciplines, Faerber
took fourth place in the three-
meter and the platform.
Though the diving board has
been a source of frustration
for the Wolverines this season,
Faerber delivered, something
that is sure to inspire confidence
in the team going forward -
especially considering how well
he bounced back from the few
dives that didn't score highly.
"I actually don't try to clear
my mind," Faerber said. "I let it
sit there. I used to try to forget
about it, but that's impossible. I
let it sit there to fuel to my next
dive and make me angry, and I
know I have to make up for it
with my next few."
Back in the pool, Michigan's
most electric display came from
senior Kyle Whitaker and soph-
omore Dylan Bosch.
The pair went 1-2 in three
individual events, including
both individual medleys. Bosch
won the 200-yard butterfly, set-
ting a new Big Ten record in pre-
liminaries and leading a pack of
Wolverines that took four of the
top five spots. In the final, Bosch
set the pace at 1:40.54, and was
followed by his training partner,
Whitaker, in 1:41.90. Brumm
and Wojciechowski took fourth
and fifth, respectively.
Whitaker, though, got the
best of the sophomore in the two
medleys. In Thursday's 200-yard
individual medley, Whitaker fin-
ished in 1:41.30, closely followed
by Bosch in 1:41.66. Earlier in the
day at prelims, Whitaker broke
former Wolverine Tyler Clary's
school record by swimming the
race ina time of 1:41.14.
Clary, an Olympic gold med-
alist in the 200-meter back-
stroke, was in the building to see
his record broken.
"Obviously, I'd love to keep
the record forever," Clary said.
"It's cool that the guys that
broke them are guys that I've
trained with. I've come to know
them, and I like them a lot.
"I know that those guys focus
a lot on detail. If anything, I
was watching them to see if I
could learn anything about their
breaststroke."
Clary too is part of the win-
ning tradition built at Canham
Natatorium.
The eastern wall of the pool
building holds the offices of
Bottom, diving coach KZ Li
and all of their assistants. In
the window of each office sits
a Big Ten championship trophy
- a reminder to everyone who
walks by of the high standard
for success.
"I think (it's intimidating),"
Jaeger said. "I think (other
swimmers) know where they
are when they walk in here."
Jaeger did his part to take up
more window space over the
weekend. The senior successful-
ly defended his titles in both the
500-yard and 1,650-yard free-
styles and added a fourth-place
finish in the 400-yard individu-
al medley.
In the 1,650-yard event, Jae-
ger was flanked by sophomore
Anders Lie Nielsen, his training

'season ends in NIT

Women's basketball
finishes 20-14,
loses in 3rd round
to Bowling Green
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
MARCH 27, 2014, BOWL-
ING GREEN, Ohio - It's safe to
say the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team will want to beat
Bowling Green next year. Badly.
The Wolverines kicked off
their season with a loss to Bowl-
ing Green (17-1 MAC, 30-4 over-
all) in early November, and just
four and a half months later, the
Falcons picked up where they
left off. Michigan's season ended
just like it started after the Wol-
verines (8-8 Big Ten, 20-14) fell
63-53 in the third round of the
WNIT.
In one of the loudest venues
Michigan has played in this sea-
son, Bowling Green pushed the
Wolverines from both teams'
favorite spot - the 3-point arc.
The Falcons hit five of nine from
beyond the arc in the first half
and added four more in the sec-
ond, holding Michigan to 3-for-
13 from three.

Sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski, who in recent weeks
has become the Wolverines'
most lethal long-range threat,
was unable to find a rhythm.
And freshman guard Siera
Thompson, who has hit a three
in all 35 games this season, went
just 1-of-5.
"I think our team really grew
(between matchups with the
Falcons), really improved and
really found its identity," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes

tough at home. They had a great
atmosphere here tonight, but I
think they had the edge playing
here."
Despite getting out of reach
late, the game looked promis-
ing early for the Wolverines
who, after trailing for the first
few minutes of the game, got a
jumper from the right side of
the key from junior forward
Nicole Elmblad to put them up
12-10 five minutes in. The bas-
ket not only marked Michigan's
new program record for points
in a season but also the Wol-
verines' last lead of the game.
From there, Michigan went
tight when its baskets weren't
falling.
"I think this time that we

played them we definitely start-
ed off a lot stronger," Elmblad
said. "This time we were more
focused and ready to lock up on
defense, but unfortunately we
didn't hold that the entire first
half and they were able to make
a good run."
With 5:02 left in the half and
the game still within reach,
Elmblad hit a fadeaway that put
Michigan within one, but the
Falcons countered with a 9-1 run
to end the half, putting the Wol-
verines down nine going into
the locker room. Bowling Green
used strong 3-point shooting,
going 5-for-9 in the first 20 min-
utes, to pad its lead.
Unfortunately for Michigan,
the second half wasn't any pret-
tier. The Wolverines were once
again plagued by turnovers,
committing12.
After beating their last two
WNIT opponents by an aver-
age of 38 points while commit-
ting 17.5 turnovers, Michigan
couldn't overcome the turnovers
in conjunction with a 40-per-
cent shooting night.
By the end of the night the
Bowling Green crowd was
deafening and the Wolverines
couldn't generate a last-minute
spark - ending their season just

As theUniversityhasexpand-
ed under Coleman's tenure,
Ann Arbor residents and city
officials have felt the effects of
its encroachment into the city.
The University has purchased
numerous properties within
the city, and a point of tension
between the two institutions.
Hieftje said he fears that the
city is reaching a tipping point
at which taxes must be raised
as a result of the significant tax
base loss the city experiences
as a direct result of University
expansion. Since the University
is a public entity, the school does
not pay property taxes to the
city for its buildings. The more
land the University purchases,
the more potential revenue it
takes from the city.
"We continue, in all other
areas, to have a good rela-
tionship with the University,
because if you look at that spe-
cifically over time, it's been very,
very significant as far as the
last 12 years, Hieftje said. "The
city has lost 5 percent of its tax
income because of the Univer-
sity. They do a lot of wonderful
things for us - they bring a lot
of culture, they help us attract
talent - it's just that practical
point that you cannot make all
of the land un-taxable."

clash over

Local residents
upset with lack of
compromise on
part of UMHS
By SHOHAM GEVA
Summer ManagingNews Editor
JULY 8, 2014 - The $34
million, 725-space University
parking garage that opened
Monday on Wall Street was
never one of the big ticket
items in the University of
Michigan Health System's
2005 expansion plan.
Located on the edge of the
medical campus but border-
ing the Ann Arbor Lower
Town residential neighbor-
hood, the garage wasn't even
the focal point of planned
development in its corridor,
which also included a major
2006-2010 renovation to the
Kellogg Eye Center. Further-
more, it built on previous
efforts in the area, adding on
to an already existing lot.
However, over the years
between its first approval in
2008 and second approval-
with modifications in 2012
following an unsuccessful
attempt at a city partner-
shipto place it elsewhere, the
project found plenty of vis-
ibility from a different sector.
Along with a net gain of 509
parking spaces for UMHS,
the opening also came with
a history of years of disagree-
ment between the University
and Lower Town residents,
prompted by its location
between campus and city.
Jim Kosteva, Univer-
sity director of community
relations, said in an e-mail
interview the University was
pleased to be able to open
the garage and fulfill a major
need on campus.
"The medical center area
has seen the greatest growth
in new employees over the
past decade, yet no additional
parking spaces have been
added inthispartofcampus,"
he wrote. "Many employees
have been inconvenienced by
having to park greater dis-
tances from their workplace
or spend time hunting for a
space."
However, in a series of
community meetings in both
2008 and in 2012, residents
expressed concerns about
the structure's impact on the
city ranging from increased
traffic to environmental com-
plications and aesthetic prob-

JAN. 28, 2014 - Four candi-
dates have declared for the Ann
Arbor mayoral race of 2014, and
though they all identify as Dem-
ocrats, their personalities, the
issues they plan to emphasize
and the way they plan to interact
with the University all differ.
Each candidate has a connec-
tion to Ann Arbor, whether it be
academic or personal, and each
has varying degrees of support
for current Mayor John Hieftje
(D) and experience as an elected
member of the City Council.
Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) attended the
University for 12 years, earn-
ing degrees
in vocal per-
formance,
English and "For ma
history and
finally attend- is w
ing the Law
School. His w hat th
background
has led him don't m
to explore
his long-term
interest in
governmentA
and politics
through the City Council.
Working as a transactional
lawyer, Taylor believes he has an
ability to work well with people
in opposition to one another.
Since his election to the City
Council in 2008 - when he
defeated Stephen Kunselman
(D-Ward 3), another current
councilmember now running fori-
mayor - Taylor has focused on a
few key issues in preservingAnn
Arbor's character while still
being open to innovation.
"Ann Arbor is a place where
there is tremendous opportu-
nity but there is also a value in
its character," Taylor said. "It
will be important that the next
mayor focuses on transporta-
tion, stability and trying to
ensure that we have the kind of
modest growth that will enable
us to attract and keep young
people in the city."
While Hieftje has yet to
endorse any candidate, Taylor's
voting history is very similar to
the mayor's.
Councilmember Sally Peters-
en (D-Ward 2) categorized the
candidates asbeingin supportor
opposed to the mayor's policies.
Petersen, in contrast to Taylor,
is an infrequent supporter of the
mayor. She attended Williams
College and Harvard Business
School and has been on the City
Council for more than a year.
Although she and Kunselman
have been in agreement on many
of the issues that have appeared
in the City Council over the past
year, Petersen said their person-
alities differ greatly.
"He seems to be at odds with
the mayor quite a bit," Petersen
said. "Steve and I actually tend
to vote very similarly, but it's
not because I'm voting against
the mayor, it's because I really
believe in the issue. His tem-
perament is very different from
mine - I like to consider myself
very diplomatic and collabora-
tive. He likes the argument."
While Petersen is currently
a stay-at-home mom, her back-
ground includes a focus on busi-

ness and customer concerns,
traits she said are highly trans-
ferable to the position of mayor.
Although Petersen and Taylor
do not seem to be in agreement
on all past City Council issues,

been told that is unique from all
of the other people running."
When it comes to the Univer-
sity, each councilmember hopes
to establish strong relation-
ships with the school in spite of
some competing interests. As
for expanding campus outward,
Ann Arbor residents often voice
concerns that their traditional,
family-based neighborhoods
could be in danger of a student
takeover.
"It is not, however, because of
the people in the building," Bri-
ere said. "But for many people,
their shorthand is we don't want
students because what they are
really saying is we don't want
beer pong, and I can understand
that."
The expanding Universityhas
increased tensions with the city,

Kunselman said his and Taylor's
politics and personality still dif-
fer for this election.
"That grudge is still out
there," Kunselman said. "There
is a contingent of peoplethat feel
they are better than the rest of
us."
As a University employ-
ee, Kunselman has a unique
approach to University and city
relations. He has also empha-
sized his intentions to make Ann
Arbor a more fiscally respon-
sible and practical city.
"Local government has con-
tracted in the past few years,"
Kunselman said. "It's going be
a slow road to get back some
of that because obviously gov-
ernment finance is much more
constrained than it has been in
years past."

Iconic 'Hash

Blake Transit Center reopens

Transportation
services aim to serve
as model for state
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Summer Daily News Editor
JULY 9, 2014 - Monday
morning, Ann Arbor residents
joined federal and local
legislators to commemorate the
grand opening of the new Blake
Transit Center on Fifth Avenue.
The Ann Arbor Area
Transportation Authority's
$8.1 million project included
demolition of the previously
existing transit center to build
a 12,019 square-foot facility that
lawmakers and contractors hope
will become a social hub in the
downtown area. In addition,
architects employed sustainable
and eco-friendly initiatives and
designs for the new building.
The center is the first
step in the AAATA's plans to
modernize and increase public
transportation in the area. Ann
Arbor and Ypsilanti passed a
millage early May to include
more night and weekend
bus routes; extend routes
to Ypsilanti and offer more
services for elderly and disabled
passengers.
"Today's grand opening
ushers in a new era for public
transportation in Ann Arbor,"
AAATA CEO Michael Ford
said. "The new Blake Transit
Center represents a unique
opportunity to promote Ann
Arbor as the home of one of

Michigan's effective, efficient,
environmentally-friendly public
transportation services."
The building received
the LEED Gold certification
from the U.S. Green Building
Council for its environmental
excellence, and it also complies
with guidelines required under
the Americans with Disabilities
Act
Some of the environmentally-
friendly features of the building
include the use of storm water
collected from the roof in public
restrooms,heated driveways and
sidewalks to decrease snow-salt
usage and the reuse of materials
from the former transit building
in the new facility.
Contractors and managers
of the center also partnered
with small Ann Arbor-based
and Detroit-based businesses in
excavating and facilitating the
building. Managers chose these
companies under the guidelines
of federal programs devoted
to fostering growth in local
economies and helping minority
individuals and women run
businesses. The center received
$7 million in federal funds
towards the renovation project.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
spoke at the event on the
importance of mass transit
to help move communities
forward. He said though he loved
to see American automobiles on
the road, mass transit is critical
in helping those that can't afford
their own vehicle.
Dingell also congratulated
the Ann Arbor community for its
achievement, and noted that this

Tech companies could spur rebirth of E. Liberty St.

By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily News Editor
DEC. 4, 2013 - The lights
from the Michigan Theater have
shone for more than 80 years,
but its constant presence has
been the exception rather than
the rule for businesses on East
Liberty Street.
In recent years the street has
seen a shuffle of businesses,
most notably the closure of the
flagship Borders bookstore in
2011. But the transformation
of the Borders space was one
of many over the course of the
street's history.
Before Borders, Jacobson's
department store occupied the
space on the corner of East Lib-
erty and Maynard Street, until
it moved to Briarwood Mall in
the 80s.
When Susan Pollay, execu-

tive director of the Downtown experience and, like Jacobson's storefront turnover in the past

"It became its own kind of East Liberty has seen a lot of fragile here for a while, and I

don't know that we all under-
stand just how fragile it is to
have an independent business,"
Pollay said.
Though there are still a few
empty storefronts, Pollay said
she sees the street growing and
evolving to support a different
clientele than in the past: tech
workers. Two tech companies,
Menlo Innovations and Barra-
cuda Networks, relocated to the
East Liberty corridor in the past
twoyears, which Pollay said will
bring a more stable customer
base than that of students, who
aren't in the city year-round and
don't necessarily venture down
the street.
"The neighborhood is going
to change because the new
economy fortunately includes a
lot of folks who are doing very
well in tech businesses and
those employees are now spend-

ing their money locally in that
neighborhood," Pollay said.
Anna Flynn of Menlo Inno-
vations said though they have
only been in their East Liberty
location for about a year and
a half, employees enjoy being
close to all the shops and res-
taurants that State Street, Main
Street and East Liberty have to
offer. Flynn added that they are
excited for the new businesses
moving into the former Borders
building.
"We love being downtown
and close to everything and see-
ing Liberty grow and change,"
Flynn said. "I think that East
Liberty is in the middle of town,
but it's not on Main Street or on
State Street so you can get the
best of both worlds."

Twelve hospitalized in UMHSintensive care with HiN1

Doctors say lack
of vaccination may
be factor in high
number of cases
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily Neas Editor
Twelve patients at the Uni-
versity Hospital are receiving
treatment in the intensive care
unit after contracting the H1N1
influenza virus - the same
strain seen in the 2009 "swine
flu" pandemic.
Dr. Sandro Cinti, professor
of infectious diseases, said sev-
eral of the patients have been
placed on an advanced form of
life support known as ECMO -
extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation. While the procedure

is intended to give patients more
time to recover from their dis-
ease, Cinti said it is both "very
serious" and a "last resort" for
the most seriously afflicted
patients.
All twelve patients are cur-
rently breathing with the help
of mechanical ventilators and
receiving aggressive treatment
to prevent infection while doc-
tors treat the underlying influ-
enza.
The patients range in age
from 22 to 58 and most were
considered healthy prior to con-
tracting the disease. This range
is consistent with 2009 infection
patterns, which showed young-
er demographics infected at a
higher rate than the elderly, who
were most likely exposed to a
similar form of the disease many
years ago.
H1N1 was most widely pub-

licized during 2009 - prior to
the creation of a vaccine - when
it killed over 470 individuals in
the U.S. Despite fading from the
public spotlight, the disease has
been present in every flu season
since the pandemic, Cintisaid.
"Last year it was just at a very
low level, but this year it's the
main flu going around," Cinti
said.
Since the current flu vaccine
is designed to protect individu-
als against the HiNi flu strain,
doctors at UMHS speculate the
12 individuals currently in the
ICU did not receive the vaccine,
or were infected before it was
able to take effect.
"This is a preventable disease,
so people should get vaccinat-
ed," Cinti said. "This is another
example of what happens when
the population doesn't take
recommendations from public

health and get vaccinated."
Although UMHS usually sees
several critical flu cases each
year, Cinti said 12 patients is an
unusual occurrence. In addition,
the flu season is not expected to
hit its peak for another couple
of weeks, meaning more cases
could be admitted.
This year's flu season, which
started slightly later than in the
past, will likely extend into Feb-
ruary and potentially further,
Cinti said.
The University accepts com-
plex referrals from across the
region, which may have contrib-
uted to the high number of criti-
cal cases.
"That's one of the reasons we
may be seeing more sick patients
is that we are a referral cen-
ter from all over the state and
from other states," Cinti said.
"This particular procedure, this

machine is really unique to just a
few centers in the state."
ECMO was used in a similar
context in 2009 to treat criti-
cal patients. Although it wasn't
originally designed for this pur-
pose, it has been used to suc-
cessfully treat a small number of
extreme cases.
"By the time you're on ECMO,
you're pretty sick and your

chances of survival or rather
low," Cinti said.
Cinti advises individuals to
take protective measures, such
as staying home if sick, to pre-
vent spreading the flu to other
individuals.



PARKING
From Page 1F
lems with the way the building
matched others nearby.
In 2008, the Ann Arbor City
Council got involved by passing a
resolution asking the University
to pause plans, which led to the
unsuccessful attempt at partner-
ship later that year.
Executive Parking Director
Steve Dolen said the garage did
receive more attention than can
be typical.
"This one, there may have
been more of a level of engage-
ment because of the proximity to
private residence," he said. "But
I think there's always a level of
community engagement with our
projects."
The final design of the newly-
opened garage included several
features designed to address
community concerns, including a
rain garden for runoff, a layered
pattern of darker brick to blend
more with surrounding buildings
and panels detailing the street's

history.
However, Tim Mortimer, pres-
ident of the Riverside Park Place
Condominium Association, said
nearby residents remain dissatis-
fied with the final product.
"None of the genuine concerns
were addressed," he said. "They
essentially put lipstick on a pig."
He cited unresolved issues of
increases in traffic and noise as
well as potential danger to chil-
dren from busier streets, adding
that -the environmental impact
from the pressure of 700 addi-
tional vehicles in the area also
remains a broader, fundamental
split of interest between the city
and the University.
"The last thing the city needs
is to have more single-occupant
vehicles commuting back and
forth near the center of the city
and back out again," Mortimer
said. "What's needed is the Uni-
versity to be genuinely committed
(to environmental stewardship.)"
This isn't the only Univer-
sity project in recent years to
run into issues due to a location
on the edges of campus. When

North Quadrangle was pro-
posed in 2006, original designs
were rejected by the regents
because of concerns about walk-
ability and fit. Several features,
including the courtyard, were
added to help blend the building
more with its surroundings.
Kosteva said the primary
consideration when deciding to
build on outer parts of campus
is whether the project fulfills the
University's core purposes.
"We are attempting to provide
the residents and the taxpayers
of the state of Michigan; and our
student and our healthcare cus-
tomers, with quality facilities to
provide research and teaching
and healthcare environments
that satisfy and enhance our mis-
sion," he said.
He added that while he hoped
residents would agree that com-
munity input was incorporated
in the garage, he recognized that
they were advocating for other
uses for the space.
"You would understandably
get two different opinions about
the extent of accommodation and

how much of the commentary
and comments are reflected in
it," he said. "I think, as I outlined,
this was a case where the Univer-
sity did listen, and we did hear
the expressions of concern and
the expression of interest regard-
ing the architectural treatment
and the facility's impact on the
neighborhood."
In the end, Councilmember
Sabra Briere (D- Ward 1), whose
ward includes the project, said
legally there's not much recourse
available to residents. The Uni-
versity isn't currently obligated
to compromise with the city on
this, or on other construction
projects.
However, she added that while
she recognized the University's
desire to meet its needs, she
hopes in the future they'll do it
in a way that's more conciliatory
with the city.
"I don't fault the University for
having its own agenda," she said.
"I just wish that they'd recognize
that other people and groups
have rights as well."

DEWOLF
From Page iF
the dots back to DeWolf's alleged
killers.
Police found it had been sold
on Craigslist by a man named
Jayson Atkins, who made the
exchange in Ann Arbor at the
State Street Starbucks. In state-
ments to the police, Atkins
asserted that he had met another
man, Joei Jordan, at a gas sta-
tion and paid $200 for the stolen
Macbook Air. He also provided
police with an explanation for
the cheap price tag: the sell-
ers only had a short period of
time to move their goods before
"heading south." It was this
identification of the man respon-
sible for the sale of this stolen
laptop that lead police to arrest
Jordan, Franklin and Jones in
South Carolina. At this point, it
is unclear how exactly the three
were tracked down.
In South Carolina, Jordan and
Jones were questioned individu-
ally on Nov. 5 and 6, and their
statements led to determining
the location of the PlayStation 3,
though information at this time
is unclear.
Tracing the stolen PlaySta-
tion 3 back to the three suspects
became the next step in the
investigation. Detectives ended
up on the doorsteps of Michael
Robertson's home in Ypsilanti,
where he allegedly behaved eva-
sively.
His testimony in Friday's pre-
liminary hearing was disputed

and inconsistent, but from his
original statements, police were
able to gather that Jones, Jordan
and Franklin, who were char-
acterized by Robertson as "jit-
tery" and "hyper," were all at
Robertson's residence multiple
times after robberies-gone-
wrong. They also discussed the
DeWolf murder, as something
that "could come back on us."
Robertson helped coordinate
the sale of the item stolen from
DeWolf's fraternity to his long-
time friend, Ypsilanti resident
Patrick Davis.
Police recovered the stolen
PlayStation 3 from Davis and
verified it as the console from
DeWolf's fraternity house. Along
with the recovered laptop, these
two items will help the pros-
ecution build a case connecting
Jones and Jordan first to the
home invasion incident and sub-
sequently to DeWolf's homicide.
At their preliminary hear-
ing Friday, Jordan and Jones
made statements admitting their
involvement in the home inva-
sion and subsequent death of
DeWolf.
At this time in the investiga-
tion, much evidence remains
undisclosed, but the strategies,
witnesses and small pieces of
evidence divulged at Friday's
preliminary hearing will be
expounded upon in the upcom-
ing trial.
Jordan and Jones will remain
in custody with no bond. The
pretrial hearing is set for Janu-
ary 29 at 1:30 p.m.

"We do all the assessments
(in the main room), we take

an informed decision about how

"A lot of the time since he's been

people should be treated even if
he hasn't seen them but a lot of

how to treat and he can adjust the

that you're just giving them medi-

you're getting to know them and
it builds rapport with the com-

JULY 2, 2014, DETROIT -
Like most of the places on Lyn-
don Street, Judy Sackett's house
is small, white and boxy. Her
lawn is cut, the yard filled with
flowering shrubs. A wooden
bench sits under a large tree.
But the story of Lyndon Street
is complicated. The house next
door is vacant. Plenty of struc-
tures are visibly marked by
blight -their roofs caved in,
shells scarred by fire. A block
over sits a tract of empty land so
vast that a family uses it to ride
their off-terrain vehicles. Some
of the residents mow the grass
in the vacant lots near their
homes just to keep their stretch
of street looking okay.
Detroit's blight problem is no
secret. But for years, community
organizations and city adminis-
trations have struggled to find
an adequate approach to tackle
an issue spiraling so quickly out
of control - until last winter,
when an army of surveyors from
Detroit's newly convened Blight
Removal Task Force set out to
catalog the condition of every
single land parcel.
What they found is sure to
directly impact the city's efforts
to beat blight. But on top of that,
the report is also likely to color
the ways in which neighborhood
alliances, preservation net-
works, urban planners and resi-
dents think about their blocks
and the futures they'll have
there.

daughter relaxes in a communi-
ty-built park on Lyndon Street.

vacant lots, cleared of blighted
houses, that her family use for

compared blight to a malignant
tumor "because, like cancer,
unless you remove the entire
tumor, blight grows back."
In Detroit's Jefferson-Mack
neighborhood many blighted
homes are being demolished
while others are boarded up
in hopes of deterring criminal
activity..
Sean Jackson is the 25-year-
old Quicken Loans associate
Gilbert appointed to lead the
Motor City Mapping Project, the
report's mapping component.
Jackson said dealing with blight
is in many ways a precursor to
improving most everything else
in the city, including education,
crime, unemployment and pub-
lic health. Blight also affects the

to date. The data is already avail-
able online. Motor City Mapping
is in the process of launching an
application that allows residents
to update the status of sites on
their street - a process they call
"blexting."
It's likely this kind of project
couldn'thave happened tenyears
ago. Technology, in part, has
made the effort feasible. But even
with data, decisions about where
and when to target demolitions
can be somewhat subjective.
For that reason, Jackson
noted the Task Force is engag-
ing residents with more block-
based knowledge, but said razing
blighted structures isn't likely to
be unpopular.

Insurance not accepted here
Perhaps the most impressive
part of this clinic is not its long
standing history or that it's stu-
dent-run, but rather that in an era
of rising healthcare costs, Cass
functions at virtually no cost -
all of the students and physicians
are volunteers and most of the
medications are donated.
Neha Meta, a first year Wayne
State University School of Medi-
cine student and the finance
coordinator for the clinic, esti-
mated that each year they receive
about $20,000 in grant money,
which she said they mainly use to
purchase medications, like insu-
lin, which they have not been able
to get through donations.
Rice said each Saturday the
clinic serves 30 to 40 patients
while it's open from 9 a.m. to
noon. According to Consumer
Reports, an average retail clin-
ic - which Consumer Reports
deems as the lowest priced clinic
compared to Urgent Care centers
and Emergency Rooms - charges
on average from $55 to $75 per
visit, thus, doing the simple math,
that means a clinic like Cass,
were they collecting fees for their
services, would receive at least
$85,800 each year.
As a result, the clinic some-
times can't provide necessary
medications for patients due to
the high cost of a drug and lack
of donations, so the students and
Costea have to make recommen-
dations for the patient to go else-
where.
"The hardest part is when you
can't help someone," Rice said.
"You want to so badly because
you know that you need it but you
don't always have the resources
to help them."

Patients receive free medical attention from Wayne State medical students at
the Cass Clinic in downtown Detroit.

Oliver was waiting outside
because every Saturday morning
at 9 a.m., the Cass Community
Social Services building, located
in the Cass corridor in downtown
Detroit, becomes Cass Clinic - a
free clinic run by Wayne State
School of Medicine students.
"Especially in your first and
second year (of medical school)
you don't have any exposure to
the clinic, you don't ever really
get to see patients," Weber, who
is one of the six student coordi-
nators of the clinic, said. "That's
why I love coming here, because
it's really just students treating
patients and you do your best,"
"(The patients) know they're
seeing students, but it's better
than nothing because they don't
really have access to doctors and

option," Costea said. "The Detroit
Medical Center isn't very far
away but people felt intimidated
by the medical center, just the
name itself, and we wanted to
give them someplace they'd feel
comfortable, another option, and
where we don't even ask about
whether they do or don't have
insurance.
"We treat everybody here," he
said of the Clinic. "We try to give
them as much as possible from
what we have here."
Initially, the Clinic was given
a very small space within the
church - which still stands
across the street from the social
services building. But with the
Clinic's increasing popularity,

social services building in the
