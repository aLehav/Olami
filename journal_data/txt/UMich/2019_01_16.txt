Photojournalist Rachel Woolf’s 
exhibit “Deported: An American 
Division,” which examines the 
impact of immigration policy on 
a local family, opened Tuesday at 
Weill Hall. Woolf’s photography 
depicts Lourdes Salazar Bautista 
and her family’s deportation 
from the United States to Mexico 
in 2017. The images capture the 
days before Bautista’s deportation 
hearing in Detroit and images of 
the family in Toluca, Mexico after 
their forced return.
Woolf won the Art Works 
Projects’ 2018 Emerging Lens 
Mentorship Program competition, 
which allowed her to put together 
her exhibition. Art Works Projects 
focuses on educating the public 
about human rights and social 
justice issues through visual art.
Woolf met Bautista through 
a 
friend 
during 
Bautista’s 
campaign to stay in the United 
States. Bautista was searching 
for someone to tell her story of 
fighting deportation, and Woolf, 
a photojournalist, met with her to 
photograph her experience. Woolf 
remained in touch with Bautista 
after she left the U.S. and visited 
her in Mexico.

University 
of 
Michigan 
Central Student Government 
met 
Tuesday 
to 
discuss 
banning Wendy’s on campus, 
new CSG appointments and 
adjustments to the judicial 
branch nomination process.
Early 
in 
the 
meeting, 
Rackham student Kim Daley 
spoke about blocking Wendy’s, 
the fast food chain, from 
campus. She said the first 
food workers in the U.S. were 
slaves, and even today, slavery 
still occurs on farms. Many 
farmers signed onto the Fair 
Food Program to better labor 
conditions. 
Several 
multi-
billion dollar companies have 

pledged to improve conditions, 
but Wendy’s still has not joined 
the petition.
Daley encouraged members 
of CSG to take action against 
the presence of Wendy’s at 
the University. CSG did not 
respond to Daley’s concerns at 
the meeting but said they focus 
on it at a later date.
“You all have a lot of power 
and you are listened to,” Daley 
said. “You can block Wendy’s 
from coming to campus.”
Following the graduation 
of the previous vice chair of 
the Ethics Committee, CSG 
voted to elect Public Policy 
senior Drea Somers to fill the 
position. When asked about 
her previous experience in 

Last 
month, 
local 
businessman Tom Brady Jr., 
along with his associate Darin 
Dingham opened up an Ann 
Arbor location of Jim Brady’s 
after nearly a year’s worth of 
development 
and 
planning. 
This is the second location 
opened by the two since 2015, 
when the first Jim Brady’s 
opened its doors to the public in 
Royal Oak, Mich. 
The restaurant served its 
first meal on December 10. 
According to Brady, the vibrant 
culture of the Ann Arbor 
community was a key factor in 
the choice to branch out into 
the area.
“Ann 
Arbor, 
to 
us, 
is 
incredibly exciting,” Brady said. 
“It’s just such a dynamic market 
in terms of the people that live 
there, in terms of the culture, 
the art and the music.”
Although the interior was 
only completed within the 
last year, the structure of the 
restaurant dates back to 1861. 
The restaurant is located in the 
heart of downtown Ann Arbor, 
close to the intersection of 
South Main and Liberty streets. 
In planning the interior of 
the restaurant, Brady hoped 
to 
capture 
the 
energy 
of 
the restaurant upon which 
Jim 
Brady’s 
was 
modeled 
— 
Diamond 
Jim 
Brady’s. 
The 
well-known 
Detroit 
restaurant and bar opened 
more than six decades ago by 

Brady’s grandfather. Located 
in 
downtown 
Detroit, 
the 
restaurant 
quickly 
gained 
popularity and became known 
for casual food and high-end 
atmosphere.
Brady recalled the origins 
of his grandfather’s restaurant 
and its success throughout 
the ’50s and ’60s, up until its 
relocation to Novi in 1990 
where it still stands today.
“He had this idea, to take this 
little corner bar and make it 
really upscale,” Brady said. “He 
had really amazing burgers, 
the chili became legendary. 
For that style of bar, that really 
wasn’t what was going on at the 

time.”
Business sophomore Alais 
Murillo explained the decades 
of success of the original 
restaurant in Detroit could 
bode well for the future of Jim 
Brady’s in Ann Arbor.
“We have such a diverse 
group of consumers as a college 
town,” Murillo explained. “If 
you’re successful in a big city 
like Detroit, that will likely 
transfer to Ann Arbor as well.”
During the year-long process 
of development, Brady and 
Dingman 
worked 
hard 
to 
emulate the atmosphere of 
the iconic Detroit restaurant, 
hiring the architecture firm 

Rossetti and Associates and 
principal 
interior 
designer 
Kelly Deines to help recreate 
the 1950s feel.
“It’s 
really 
a 
legendary 
Detroit firm, it’s been in Detroit 
since the 1940s,” Brady said. 
“They really helped us — 
starting in Royal Oak and then 
in Ann Arbor — realize what 
that whole visual experience 
was like.”
Scott Behler, an Ann Arbor 
native who now serves as the 
general manager of the Ann 
Arbor location, noted the work 
that went into finding the

The U.S. 6th Circuit Court 
of Appeals declined to hear a 
challenge to a city program 
requiring the installation of 
sump pumps in residents’ homes, 
ending the fourth such lawsuit 

Ann Arbor has faced over the 
initiative.
A 2001 ordinance established 
the Footing Drain Disconnection 
Program 
to 
alleviate 
storm 
water drainage problems, and 
while 
the 
city 
reimbursed 
homeowners for the cost of 
the renovations, the residents 

claimed in the lawsuit the city’s 
program was unconstitutional. 
They 
referenced 
the 
Fifth 
Amendment’s Takings Clause, 
which bars the seizure of private 
property for public use without 
just compensation.
City 
Attorney 
Stephen 
Postema said in a statement the 
city’s program was not a 
“taking” under state or 
federal law and the cases 
brought against Ann Arbor 
were groundless.
“The U.S. 6th Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled 
that this federal case was 
without any factual or legal 
merit,” Postema said. “… 
As has been true from the 
start, the City’s Footing 
Drain Disconnect Program 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
taking under the Michigan 
Constitution or the federal 
Constitution. 
None 
of 
this 
litigation 
should 
have ever been filed. The 
City 
Attorney’s 
Office 
will 
always 
vigorously 
defend the city from such 
lawsuits.”
Circuit 
Judge 
Alice 
Batchelder 
wrote 
the 
opinion 
affirming 
a 
previous 
decision 
by 
District 
Court 
Judge 
Stephen J. Murphy III 
to 
dismiss 
the 
case. 
Batchelder 
wrote 
the 
residents 
were 
barred 
from 
bringing 
federal 

claims that were fundamentally 
equivalent to the ones thrown 
out in state court.
“Issue 
preclusion 
bars 
subsequent litigation of the 
federal 
takings 
claim 
after 
litigation of the state takings 
claim on the merits,” Batchelder 
wrote.
In 2000, City Council passed 
an 
ordinance 
mandating 
residents install sump pumps 
after 
rainstorms 
flooded 
basements 
with 
sewage. 
In 
addition to causing residential 
backups, 
the 
storm 
water 
caused problems at the sewage 
treatment 
plant, 
sometimes 
resulting 
in 
overflow 
being 
discharged into the Huron River. 
The FDDP sought to deal with 
those issues by disconnecting 
footing 
drains 
that 
mixed 
sewage and storm water, using 
instead sump pumps to reroute 
the rainwater to the city’s storm 
water drainage system and away 
from the sanitary sewer system.
The FDDP has been the subject 
of multiple lawsuits brought by 
residents. A 2014 complaint filed 
on behalf of homeowners Anita 
Yu, John Boyer and Mary Raab, 
who went through the program 
in the early 2000s, alleged the 
FDDP amounted to the unlawful 
taking of private property in 
what the plaintiffs claimed was 
the absence of due process or just 
compensation.
According to the complaint, 

MEDICINE, EMPIRE, & RACE IN THE ROMAN WORLD 

ON THE DAILY: FOUR MICHIGAN CITIES RANK WORST IN US FOR BED BUGS 

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: LAWMAKERS AGAIN TO CONSIDER AMENDMENT 
TO LOWER VOTING AGE

If you live in Detroit, Grand Rapids, 
Lansing, or Flint, you may want 
to inspect your mattress tonight. 
According to Orkin Termite Treatment, 
these cities rank among the worst in 
the United States for bed bugs. 
The data is based on the number 
of treatments Orkin performed in 
metro areas from December 1, 2017 
to November 30, 2018. The ranking 
includes 
both 
residential 
and 
commercial treatments. 
Detroit and Flint both displayed 
progress, moving down from their 
2018 rankings. Detroit ranks number 8, 

which moved down from spot 7 in 2018, 
while Flint has moved down the ranks 
considerably, placing 47 after holding 
spot 36 in 2018. 
Grand Rapids has moved up the 
ranks, placing at number 20 after 
holding spot 23 in 2018. Lansing ranks 
32 after being unranked in 2018. 
Nationally, Baltimore takes first place 
in Orkin’s ranking with Washington 
D.C. taking second. 
“Bed bugs are the number one urban 
pest in many cities today,” Chelle 
Hartzer, an Orkin entomologist, told 
ClickOn Detroit. “They are master 

hitchhikers, so no one is immune. 
Sanitation has nothing to do with 
prevention: from public transit to five-
star resorts, bed bugs have been and 
can be found everywhere humans are.” 
Luckily, according to Orkin, there are 
steps homeowners can take to prevent 
bed bug invasions. Inspecting places 
where bed bugs tend to congregate 
during the day, such as mattress 
tags and seams, headboards, behind 
baseboards, 
electrical 
outlets 
and 
picture frames, is an important first 
step to identifying if you have a bed bug 
problem. Don’t let the bedbugs bite. 

January 13, 1970
In what has become an 
annual 
affair, 
the 
State 
legislature will again consider 
placing on the November ballot 
a 
constitution 
amendment 
which would lower the voting 
age to 18. 
Rep. 
Jackie 
Vaughn 
III 
(D-Detroit) 
said 
yesterday 
he plans to introduce the 
amendment proposal by the end 
of the month. The Legislature 
reconvenes tomorrow. 
The proposed amendment 
was defeated both times it 
was placed on the ballot by the 

Legislature. The last time it 
was on the ballot in 1966, the 
amendment lost by a vote of 
1,270,000 to 703,000,000. 
Vaughn 
predicted 
the 
amendment proposal would 
be able to muster the 2/3 
majority 
in 
both 
houses 
which is required to place an 
amendment on the statewide 
ballot. 
However, other supporters 
of the proposal were less 
confident. “It’s going to be 
a tough fight,” said House 
Speaker 
William 
Ryan 
)
D-Detroit), who supports the 

proposal. 
Sen. Roger Craig (D-Detroit) 
said he believed the amendment 
proposal would get through 
the House but not through the 
Republican-controlled Senate. 
Craig 
said 
many 
state 
legislators were in favor of the 
18-year-old vote in principle, 
but felt it was useless to placed 
amendment 
on 
the 
ballot 
which the people appeared not 
to favor. 
The legislators who support 
the amendment believe it has 
a better chance at the polls 
this November. Craig said the 

campaign will be aided by 
the 
increased 
participation 
of those most concerned with 
the amendment’s passage—the 
18-21 year olds. 
“The kids appear to be 
concerned more than they 
were in 1966,” he said. “They 
appear to be more enthusiastic 
about this issue.”
Craig 
said 
several 
high 
school 
groups 
and 
youth 
organizations have indicated 
their intention to lobby for the 
voting amendment after it is 
introduced in the Legislature. 
Should 
the 
amendment’s 

supporters be unable to muster 
the two-thirds majority of 
both houses necessary for 
placing it on the ballot, the 
youth group plans to organize 
a 
statewide 
petition 
drive 
on the amendment proposal. 
The signatures of eight per 
cent of the others in 1966 
gubernatorial election would 
then place the amendment on 
the November ballot. 
After being introduced into 
the House, the amendment 
proposal will be sent to the 
Committee on the Revision of 
the Constitution. 

The amendment proposal 
was announced along with 
several 
proposed 
measures 
which Vaughn said are part 
of a campaign to encourage 
young people to become more 
interested in politics. 
The other measures include:
—A bill which would allow 
people between the ages of 18 
and 21 to circulate petitions for 
political candidates. 
—A bill which would allow 
people between the ages of 18 
and 21 to serve as “precinct 
delegates.”

dealing with ethics on campus, 
Drea responded by describing 
her experience as a team leader 
of the University organization 
America Reads Tutoring Corps.
“I’m a team leader, so one 
thing that is interesting about 
that is rule enforcement and 
making sure I’m not partial to 
people because I know them, 
so as a team leader I make sure 
they’re following the code of 
conduct,” Somers said. “I have 
experience in terms of rule 
enforcement, in terms of, ‘Oh, 
hey, let’s have a conversation,’ 
and I don’t think conflict is 
something we should be shy of.”
When 
discussing 
new 
business 
occurring 
around 
campus, 
Law 
student 
Jacob Podell spoke about a 
constitutional 
amendment 
regarding the selection of the 
University’s 
Central 
Student 
Judiciary justices.
Adam Glass, speaker of the 
Assembly, commented on CSG’s 
efforts to improve the selection 
process.
“It seems that a lot of 
branches of CSG are coming 
together right now and are 
saying, ‘Let’s try and rethink 
this nomination process to make 
sure it allows for a diverse pool 
of applicants,’ and it effectively 
allows members of each of the 
three branches of government to 
be involved in the process early 
on,” Glass said. “This allows any 
red flags to be spotted early.”
According to Podell, two of 
the main reasons for proposing 
these adjustments include a lack 
of efficiency in the nominating 
process and a lack of diversity in 
the nominations pool.
“I think the biggest problem 
with the current system and 
the old system is diversity in 
recruitment,” Podell said. “I 
personally think the reason CSG 
is incapable of recruiting diverse 
candidates is our network is 
small. We are nine (justices) and 
need a system that incorporates 
the legislature and executive 
branch as a larger network to get 
more candidates.”

Under the current justice 
nomination process, the justices 
of the judiciary bring together a 
pool of potential nominees to fill 
an empty seat. They then present 
that list to the president, who 
selects and brings the nominee 
to the Assembly to advise, 
consent 
to 
and 
eventually 
confirm the nominee.
Under 
the 
new 
system, 
instead of the justices choosing 
a pool on their own and the 
executive branch subsequently 
vetting and choosing a nominee, 
both branches would complete 
the tasks at the same time.
In the proposed system, the 
committee for nominating a 
justice would have six members, 
four of which would have voting 
power. Two of those voting 
members would be justices 
and the other two would be 
appointed from the Assembly 
by the CSG president and 
vice president. The final two 
members would be the chief 
justice, who would break ties 
if necessary, and an observing 
member 
of 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly. The full Assembly 
then 
discussed 
potentially 

having the current chair of 
the 
Executive 
Nominations 
Committee 
serve 
as 
the 
observer.
Glass 
did 
not 
discuss 
his personal opinion of the 
measure, but said the authors 
of the proposed system believe 
improvements to the existing 
nomination 
process 
were 
needed.
“So 
under 
the 
current 
nomination 
process, 
the 
authors believe it needs some 
work,” Glass said. “Changes by 
the Assembly to the compiled 
code have indicated that the 

people necessary for an optimal 
restaurant staff.
“We started interviewing back 
in April, and didn’t stop until we 
opened,” Behler said. “We had 
over 700 people apply, probably 
about 500 interviews and ended 
up hiring about 120 people.”

Executive 
chef 
Ian 
Hockenberger 
attributed 
the 
attention 
drawn 
in 
by 
the 
restaurant 
thus 
far 
to 
the 
restaurant’s quality food and 
ingredients.
“We’re using a lot of local 
ingredients, 
a 
lot 
of 
local 
purveyors,” Hockenberger said. 
“We like to have fun with our 
menu. The food’s all really high 
quality.”

Hockenberger also credited 
the success of Jim Brady’s to the 
general retro ambiance of the 
restaurant.
“The visuals that you get inside 
the restaurant are great,” he said. 
“It’s really a stunning place to eat, 
especially the upper floors.”
Despite the consumer traffic 
the location and aesthetics of 
Jim Brady’s has brought since 
its opening, Brady still credits 

the majority of his restaurant’s 
success to the energy of his staff 
and the Ann Arbor community.
“My dad told me a long time 
ago: The secret to the restaurant 
business is people, people, people, 
location,” 
Brady 
explained. 
“Without the people and the 
energy that our team brings and 
that the community brings, it’s 
nothing.”

The Ross School of Business’ 
Case Competition team took first 
place at the ninth annual MBA 
National Case Competition, held 
Jan. 3-5 at Deloitte University in 
Westlake, Texas according to PR 
Newswire.
Business graduate students 
Thomas 
Corness, 
Jessica 
McClain, 
Jason 
Rock 
and 
Andrea Schiff earned a total 
of $20,000 in scholarships for 
their win. The competition, 
which challenges students to 
develop 
innovative 
solutions 

to business problems, hosted 
1,000 students from top MBA 
programs across the country in 
the regional competitions, with 
only 64 advancing to national 
finals.
The U-M team came in 
first place for their innovative 
presentation 
on 
a 
growth 
strategy 
for 
sweetgreen, 
a 
healthy fast food chain. The 
restaurant model would value 
transparency, 
nutritional 
value of menu offerings and 
environmentally 
sustainable 
business 
practices. 
The 
company, which operates in 
almost 100 locations throughout 

the U.S., sent leaders to judge the 
competition in addition to other 
industry and Deloitte leaders.
“This year, we challenged 
the teams with a case focused 
on creating a growth strategy 
for a startup health-conscious 
restaurant chain,” Bill Lam, 
principal of Deloitte Consulting 
LLP, said to PR Newswire. 
“The participants approached 
the case with passion and 
determination for helping guide 
a socially conscious, purpose-
driven brand. The competition 
provided the MBA students 
great exposure to the realities 
of working in a dynamic, ever-

changing business world.”
Competing teams suggested 
business development growth 
through 
expanding 
product 
offerings, creating innovative 
formats for target consumers, 
utilizing digital opportunities 
and 
identifying 
the 
requirements needed to execute 
those strategies.

her the Charles Rufus Morey Book 
Award — an award acknowledging 
distinguished books that have 
contributed meaningfully to the 
field.
Elizabeth Sears, chair of the 
History of Art Department, said 
Forsyth’s commitment to creating 
a global and wide-ranging history 
department made her a celebrated 
professor for more than 30 years.
“She was a really famous teacher 
in the day,” Sears said. “Very 
conscientious, (she) put together 
beautiful art history lectures 
where words and texts worked so 
well. She really helped people to 
learn to look, to see. I think she 
was very devoted to the University 
of Michigan, to art history and to 
her own field —medieval.”
As 
a 
result 
of 
Forsyth’s 
donation, the University became 
the second in the country to offer 
a professorship in the specialty 
of medieval art. Sears noted how 
medieval history is sometimes 
misused by contemporary politics 
to discuss ideas of racial purity. 

She said the professorship allows 
the department to shed light on an 
often neglected or misunderstood 
historical period.
“The Michigan department has 
always believed in the importance 
of studying many cultures and 
deep history,” Sears said. “Whereas 
some departments are focusing 
more exclusively on modern and 
contemporary, 
we 
believe 
in 
having a full chronological as well 
as geographical range. Medieval 
has been one of our great strengths 
for decades. This (gift) preserves 
it.”
Jeffrey 
Craft, 
chief 
administrator of the department, 
said the donation allows the 
department to “transcend” its 
previous 
research 
and 
study 
abroad programs. Craft noted how 
Forsyth’s gift will positively impact 
the history of art department as 
well as LSA as a whole.
“As for LSA, I think (the 
donation) will help them because 
there are things where we would 
go to them and ask them for 
funding, and that we now can be 
more self-sufficient,” Craft said. 
“That frees up the funds to be used 
for other departments and other 

initiatives. It’s a win not only for us 
as a department, but for LSA.”
Craft said the introduction 
of postdoctoral fellowships and 
faculty research projects allows 
the department to stand among 
national 
programs. 
He 
also 
mentioned how the donation, 
one of the largest ever given to a 
humanities department in LSA, 
must be distributed carefully in 
order to ensure the money will 
support different projects for 
undergraduates, graduates and 
faculty members.
“With such an endowment, 
there comes responsibilities on 
making sure we utilize the funds 
how Professor Forsyth wanted 
them to be used, while following 
all the regulations from the 
University,” Craft said.
The department has not decided 
on how to allocate the funds, but 
hopes the donation will incentivize 
new talented professors join the 
University.
Rackham 
student 
Michelle 
Al-Ferzly, whose research focuses 
on medieval Islamic art, considers 
Forsyth’s donation instrumental 
in guaranteeing the future of 
medieval studies at the University.

“If there is a professor in a 
certain discipline in a department 
and they retire, sometimes it is 
really hard to replace them because 
there aren’t funds devoted to that 
specific field,” Al-Ferzly said. 
“Having that professorship will 
just ensure that our department 
will continue to have expertise in 
the medieval field.”
Sears echoed this statement, 
noting how the gift will attract 
faculty members with a history 
of strong teaching and innovative 
research.
“It’s 
also 
very 
good 
for 
recruiting because it makes it very 
attractive for a faculty member to 
come to a place where they know 
that they have serious research 
money that is dedicated to their 
field of interest,” Sears said. 
“Of course, as you go outside, 
particularly in the humanities, 
there is a great deal of competition 
for limited resources. It’s also a 
world in which we’re realizing the 
advantages of collaborative work. 
The fact that this can supply the 
seed money for more ambitious, 
long-term projects is extremely 
attractive.”

“My favorite thing is to connect 
with people and that’s what I love 
about doing this sort of work,” 
Woolf said. “What’s challenging 
is seeing the people you start to 
care about hurting in a way that I 
wish I could do more. I think the 
most challenging is that all I can 
do it limited to a point. I can do 
everything I can and she is still in 
Mexico.”
Bautista has lived in Ann 
Arbor for the past 20 years with 
her three children, Pamela, 19, 
Lourdes, 16, nicknamed “Lulys,” 
and Bryan, 14, who were all 
born in the United States. After 
their permission to remain in 
the U.S. was denied, Bautista 
was forced to return to Mexico 
with her two youngest children. 
There, Bautista reunited with 
her 
husband, 
Luis 
Quintana 
Chaparro, who was deported 
in 2010. Lulys stayed in Mexico 
for one year and returned to the 
U.S. to be with her older sister 
Pamela, who chose to continue 
her education at Michigan State 
University.
The exhibit consisted of four 
panels of Woolf’s photographs 
and direct quotes from Bautista 
and 
her 
family 
members. 
One 
image 
showed 
Bryan’s 
schoolteacher wiping tears from 
his face as he waited in the airport 
security line to Mexico. Others 
depicted Pamela embracing her 
mother, Bautista and her husband 
cooking in a small kitchen and 
Bryan throwing old schoolwork 
into a fire in anticipation of his 
mom’s deportation.
Woolf said she hopes that 
by looking at the photographs 
viewers will understand the 
positive 
characteristics 
of 
Bautista and her family.
“The hardest thing is that a lot 
of times it’s a preconceived notion 
that being an undocumented 
immigrant comes with a bad 
connotation, so I want someone to 
look at this and see that Lourdes 
and her family are wonderful 
people that are doing the best 
they can in a difficult situation,” 
Woolf said.

Hannah Smotrich, associate 

professor in the School of Art & 
Design, designed the exhibit and 
collaborated with Public Policy 
professors Ann Lin and Fabiana 
Silva to give the photographs 
historical and political context. 
The exhibit included a timeline 
of changing immigration law 
enforcement policies from former 
president Ronald Reagan through 
President Donald Trump, as 
well as a graph representing 
the number of undocumented 
immigrants over several decades.
“I’m interested in how we can 
embed information in ways that 
allow you to access it at different 
levels,” Smotrich said. “I’ve done 
a fair amount of exhibition work 
with narrative, all of which have 
another layer of intent...the goal is 
not only to work on a visual level, 
but also to inform, whether it’s a 
social justice oriented story or 
just understanding a particular 
person’s story in a larger societal 
context.”
Kinesiology 
sophomore 
Rachel Rodriguez attended the 
event for her Latino/a American 
Studies class on Literature of 
the Undocumented. Rodriguez 
said she hoped the exhibit would 
raise awareness of the challenges 
undocumented individuals face. 
“I just hope more people 
become aware of what’s going 
on 
with 
other 
individuals,” 
Rodriguez said. “Some people 
have 
the 
privilege 
to 
stay 
in this country and to have 
documentation and apply to 
jobs, internships, schools. I just 
hope people are aware that 
undocumented people also try in 
this country.”
Similarly, LSA junior Gabriela 
Paniagua noted the importance of 
bringing attention to these issues. 
“I think this art and this 
exhibit really brings to light all 
the sacrifices people have to make 
to just make sure their children 
get what they deserve,” Paniagua 
said. “Looking around, there is 
a diverse group of people here 
having conversations about this 
art. I think exhibits like this and 
conversations like this — creating 
a discussion — can’t be bad. It’s 
good to be talking about the 
current policy going on right now. 
Real families are being affected 
by it.”

for Eduardo and opened the 
discussion by asking Eduardo 
how it feels being the grand-
son of an activist, and if there 
are feelings of guilt for not be-
ing more active in United Farm 
Workers, the organization his 
grandfather created.
“Growing up, I always felt a 
little disconnected and it was 
something that I pushed to the 
side,” Eduardo said. “I could 
give a memorized spiel about 
who he was and what he did 
but I didn’t feel a personal con-
nection.”
The son of a Mexican father 
and a Cuban mother, Eduardo 
confessed he has come to iden-
tify more with his Cuban heri-
tage.
“I actually feel more Cuban 
than I do Mexican,” Eduardo 
said. “I grew up more with my 
mom’s side of the family, always 
visiting my Cuban grandpar-

ents in Miami.”
However, he found that he grew 
closer to his father through this 
experience.
“I definitely feel through the 
process of this film closer to my 
dad and that side of the family,” 
Eduardo said.
Eduardo’s father gave him the 
advice that if he were to take 
on an activist role, it should 
come naturally. Through this 
film, Eduardo was able to find 
both his passion and his sense 
of duty.
“After making this film, I found 
my passion was filmmaking,” 
Eduardo said. “I get the best of 
both worlds — that I can make 
films and educate people at the 
same time. I can pursue my 
own creative endeavors.”
His grandfather shared the 
same approach to life. When 
asked by an audience member 
what question he would ask 
Cesar today, Eduardo stated he 
would want to know what kept 
him going despite all the obsta-

cles he faced. Eduardo shared 
that he already knew the an-
swer and that his grandfather 
believed the key to succeeding 
in life is having a passion for 
what you do.
“My grandfather used to always 
say ‘I’m not any different than 
anyone else, I just have a pas-
sion and I see what’s wrong and 
I try my hardest to fix it,’” Edu-
ardo said.
This statement resonated with 
LSA freshman Justin Hutchins, 
who said he believes it is imper-
ative the general public learn 
more about historical figures 
and discover how human they 
really are.
“There’s so much more you can 
learn about these historical fig-
ures and the human aspect of 
it,” Hutchins said. “They seem 
like not normal people, but 
even Cesar said he himself is 
just a normal guy.”
Overall, the members of La 
Casa found the event both in-
spiring and essential for the 

Latinx community. Julianna 
Collado, external director of La 
Casa, believed the documentary 
showing helped bring the com-
munity together and fostered a 
friendly environment.
“We thought this was a really 
important event to help center 
our community as Latinx stu-
dents on campus,” Collado said. 
“We really just wanted to focus 
on empowering our students, 
getting an education, getting a 
piece of their history, because 
so many people [in this group] 
identify as Mexican.” 
Ronnie Alvarez, lead director of 
La Casa, agreed and added the 
event helped with strengthen-
ing the Latinx community on 
campus.
“This event and what it was for 
aligns a lot with the goals of La 
Casa, which is a student organi-
zation that was created as not 
only a platform for political ad-
vocacy, but also to create a com-
munity,” Alvarez said.

while the plaintiffs “previously 
enjoyed 
the 
peace 
of 
mind 
and repose which comes from 
having dry basements and no 
water 
problems,” 
after 
they 
went through the program, they 
“experienced the inconvenience 
associated with the installation 
of the sump pump and related 
equipment, the ongoing burdens 
associated with the maintenance 
and operation of the sump pumps 
and, in general, the diminution in 
their quality of life attributable to 
the FDDP.”
Irvin Mermelstein, a local 
attorney, and Dan O’Brien, a 
contract lawyer from New York, 
worked together on the 2014 
effort, which ultimately failed. 

Mermelstein 
also 
represented 
Lynn Lumbard, who in 2015 filed 
a complaint against the city on 
identical grounds. It, too, was 
thrown out. In 2016, the two cases 
were consolidated and brought 
before the Court of Appeals, which 
upheld the lower court’s ruling in 
favor of the city.
Mermelstein 
and 
O’Brien 
collaborated on the most recent 
case against the city, which 
involved the same four plaintiffs 
as 
the 
previous 
challenges. 
The federal lawsuit, filed in the 
Eastern District of Michigan 
in 2017, alleged violations of 
the 
Constitution’s 
anti-slavery 
provisions and the Takings Clause.
The 
plaintiffs 
complained 
the 
program 
“destroyed 
the 
foundation drainage system at 
houses that had been constructed 
decades ago and appeared to be 
functioning as designed” and 

“replaced it with a system of 
unwanted operating equipment, 
inside and outside their homes, 
that is burdensome, costly, unsafe, 
noisy and incompatible with the 
peace of mind and comfort the 
Plaintiffs enjoyed.” The circuit 
court heard oral arguments in 
early December 2018.
Mermelstein said despite the 
circuit court’s ruling, the case was 
not yet over.
“This case is still in active 
litigation,” Mermelstein said. “It 
would be inappropriate for us 
to comment any further on the 
record at this time.”
Circuit 
Judge 
Kethledge 
issued a concurring opinion. He 
noted the plaintiffs had received 
compensation, as they owned the 
sump pumps the city installed in 
their homes.
“But the Takings Clause does 
not say that private property 

shall not ‘be taken for public use, 
without just compensation, and 
without remedy in state court,’” he 
wrote in his opinion. “Instead the 
Clause says that private property 
shall not ‘be taken for public 
use, without just compensation’ 
period. And that plainly means 
that, if the taking has happened 
and the compensation has not, 
the property owner already has 
a constitutional entitlement to 
relief.”
He said he wished the circuit 
court had decided to hear the 
matter, as the residents were 
entitled to make their case in 
court.
“Federal courts have a ‘virtually 
unflagging’ obligation to exercise 
the jurisdiction that Congress has 
given them,” he wrote. 

“Let’s try and 
rethink this 
nomination 
process,” Glass 
said.

D

ecember 2018 — the 
month 
when 
the 
stock market decided 
to abandon all normalcy and 
descend into complete and utter 
chaos. The month which instilled 
fear in all Americans about 
whether or not the 10-years-aged 
bullish market had finally begun 
to falter. The month when the 
White House abandoned all of 
America and decided it couldn’t 
deal with this ever-so-volatile 
economy, and began to argue — 
of all things — about a wall.
Okay, okay, too dramatic — I 
know. Still, it’s not exactly wrong 
for me to say 2018 really did go out 
with a bang. During the month 
of December, the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average plummeted 
more than 15 percent before 
posting a 1,086.25 point gain on 
Dec. 26, 2018, “logging its biggest 
single-day point gain ever.” This 
surprising increase came a day 
after the S&P 500 drew within 2 
points of entering a bear market 
— a condition wherein securities 
fall by 20 percent or more from a 
recent high.
Nevertheless, 
the 
market 
stayed 
resilient, 
refusing 
to 
drop into bear territory, and 
continuing said nearly 10-years-
long bullish run — the longest 
such 
run 
in 
the 
market’s 
history. During this time, the 
unemployment rate hit historic 
lows, dropping below 4 percent. 
And amid such circumstances, 
the Federal Reserve was quick to 
raise the interest rates, especially 
as indices showed inflation rising 
above the 2 percent mark.
The White House was quick to 
criticize the Fed’s raised interest 
rates, with President Trump 
lashing out, claiming that “the 
only problem our economy has 
is the Fed.” Now, such an action 
is not exactly unprecedented, as 
past presidents have been known 
to bash the Fed over economic 
policy, but it does beg the 
question of whether or not the 
Fed is making the right decision.
Before we begin analyzing 
this, however, we must first 
understand 
the 
mechanics 
behind how the Fed manages 
economic growth. The Fed is in 
charge of maintaining the federal 

funds rate — the rate at which 
financial institutions, such as 
banks, borrow money from one 
another. This influences national 
interest rates, or, simply put, the 
price tag that a lender puts on the 
money loaned to a borrower.
When the Fed decreases 
the interest rates, the amount 
of investment also increases as 
people the cost of borrowing 
decreases. As such, the amount 
of loans demanded increases, 
thereby increasing the quantity 
of 
money 
(based 
on 
the 
fractional-reserve 
banking 
system). And when the quantity 
of money increases, so does 
inflation.
In this way, the Fed has the 
ability to adjust the economy’s 
level of inflation. But why does 
this matter? There exists a 
model in economics devised 
by economist William Phillips 
— 
appropriately 
named 
the 
Phillips Curve — that posits an 
inverse 
relationship 
between 
unemployment 
rate 
and 
inflation. While most economists 
believe some level of inflation is 
acceptable, they acknowledge 
that when it gets out of hand, 
inflation is detrimental to an 
economy. By and of itself, this 
must be managed so that it 
doesn’t get too out of hand. At the 
same time, however, if inflation is 
too low, the unemployment rate 
naturally increases. This dual 
mandate is inherently very tricky 
to work with, especially due to 
many caveats. Nevertheless, a 
balance must be reached.
The Fed’s move to raise 
interest rates in 2017 and early 
2018 were very understandable. 
The United States had a booming 
economy that was showing no 
sign of stopping, something that 
is a signal of recession. However, 
as the inflation rate began to turn 
upwards of 2 percent following 
historic 
unemployment 
lows 
over the summer, in December it 
seemed to have stabilized around 
2 percent, based on fourth 
quarter data. While it definitely 
is too early to declare the “war” 
with inflation has been won — 
especially given market volatility 
in 2018 — such a trend forecasts 
good things to come in 2019.

Nevertheless, the Fed still is 
on track for additional interest 
rate hikes in 2019, something 
I think should definitely be 
approached with caution. Amid 
all of Trump’s complaining on 
the Fed’s disruption of the U.S. 
economy this past calendar year, 
there actually might be some 
truth to it based on recent trends. 
It does appear that the economy 
has begun to cool down from the 
hot start it had in 2016. 2018 was 
“the worst year for stocks since 
2008,” with the Dow and S&P 
both down by 5.6 and 6.2 percent 
respectively.
If 
the 
Fed 
were 
to 
overcompensate by increasing 
interest rates higher than they 
should be, the agency runs the 
risk of creating a recession 
by 
unnecessarily 
occluding 
economic growth. At the same 
time, if they undercompensate, 
the Fed runs the risk of inducing 
increased inflation. Both are 
formidably terrible outcomes in 
their own rights, but given our 
current circumstance, it seems to 
be a better idea to back the foot 
off the brakes a little and let the 
economy find its footing. This 
is perhaps strengthened by the 
fact that the global interest rates 
are running at levels much lower 
than those in the United States — 
a counteracting force out of the 
Fed’s control.
So despite Trump’s persistent 
complaints 
that 
the 
Fed 
is 
intentionally 
sabotaging 
his 
economy, it seems the Fed has 
truly been quite successful in 
managing 
the 
inflation 
rate 
thus far. Whether such a trend 
continues 
is 
determined 
by 
whether or not the Fed decides to 
back off on further interest rate 
hikes in 2019 (at least based on 
market signals today).
And Trump would do well to 
worry about his trade talks with 
China, which arguably played a 
large role in last year’s market 
volatility. Indeed, seeing to a 
resolution of some kind would 
help start 2019 off in a positive 
way.

Should the Fed be increasing interest rates in 2019?

Where politics, academia and tolerance collide
A

s a first-year student at the 

University of Michigan 

this past semester, I could 

see 
that 
tolerance 

was a big topic at the 

University. 
Incoming 

students 
received 

notices 
to 
attend 

tolerance-focused 

workshops, heard from 

their resident advisers 

about the importance 

of honoring differences 

and, in many ways, 

were made aware that 

mutual respect at U-M 

was vital. “Diversity, Equity and 

Inclusion” seemed not only to 

be a University office, but also 

a mantra on campus. However, 

the inverse appeared true when 

it came to the vast political and 

ideological diversity within the 

campus culture.

Rhetoric 
surrounding 

intolerance, specifically political 

intolerance, at our university 

made international headlines in 

September, when many students 

and those from all sectors of 

the school community felt that 

a professor chose to put his 

own political expression above 

a student’s academic freedom. 

This student, hoping to gain the 

professor’s 
recommendation 

to study abroad at an Israeli 

university, was denied — after 

previously being accepted — when 

the professor learned where the 

student wished to study. The 

professor stated he was pledging 

an “academic boycott against 

Israel in support of Palestinians 

living in Palestine.”

Though 
some 
argued 
the 

student could have easily received 

a recommendation letter from 

a different professor, others in 

the student body and University 

leadership viewed it as a clear 

violation of the student’s right to 

inquiry by a politically motivated 

professor.

The University administration 

responded 
by 
revoking 
his 

sabbatical 
privileges, 
and 

Elizabeth 
Cole, 
interim 
dean 

of LSA, criticized him for his 

misconduct by letter, writing, 

“Faculty…have 
discretion 
to 

decline 
(writing 
letters 
of 

recommendation) for legitimate 

reasons such as lack of time, 

information about the student, 

and 
academic 
assessment; 

however, that discretion… does 

not extend to withholding a letter 

because of your personal views 

regarding the student’s place of 

study and then using the student’s 

request as a political platform for 

your opinions, both in the media 

and in the classroom.”

Some 
in 
the 
University 

community felt that the professor 

had a legitimate right to withhold 

his recommendation on personal 

moral 
grounds. 
However, 
in 

addition 
to 
the 
University 

administration, many students, 

whether speaking as supporters 

of Israel or as self-described 

proponents of academic freedom, 

applauded 
the 
University’s 

response. 
Regardless, 
it 
was 

soon clear again that tolerance 

of 
ideological 
and 
political 

difference 
is 
still 
threatened 

at U-M. Within two weeks, a 

Graduate 
Student 
Instructor 

withheld 
her 
recommendation 

from a student who wished to 

study in Israel, and 

later, in a required 

speaking 
exhibition 

for first-year students 

in the School of Art 

& Design, a speaker 

showed a PowerPoint 

slide 
with 
side-

by-side 
pictures 
of 

Adolf 
Hitler 
and 

current Israeli Prime 

Minister 
Benjamin 

Netanyahu, 
with 

the words “Guilty of Genocide” 

written across their foreheads.

These 
actions, 
viewed 
as 

anti-Semitic and anti-Israel by 

many within and outside of the 

University, are reflections of an 

intolerance for certain ideological 

beliefs and an inequitable passing 

of 
judgement. 
Within 
both 

the required presentation and 

the refusals to write letters of 

recommendation is the frequently 

demonstrated practice of holding 

Israel to a different standard than 

other states. While the Israeli 

government’s actions may be 

frequently subject to controversy, 

it is certainly inaccurate to claim 

that 
it 
perpetuates 
genocide 

against the Palestinians. Both the 

United Nations and Palestinian 

authorities 
have 
noted 
the 

rapid growth of the Palestinian 

population 
in 
recent 
years. 

Additionally, 
even 
in 
violent 

conflict, the Israeli Defense Forces 

has been known to make repeated 

and constant efforts to prevent 

casualties of innocent civilians 

and specifically target militants 

who seek Israel’s destruction.

In these repeated incidents, it 

is clear that students and faculty 

need to be made increasingly 

aware of the necessary respect not 

only for another’s race, economic 

background or ethnicity, but also 

for differing political stances 

and worldviews. Incidents such 

as these carry the power to not 

only 
harm 
academic 
inquiry 

and freedom, but also the safe 

environment 
the 
University 

strives to create for students and 

faculty.

In the results of a survey 

published 
by 
the 
University 

in 
November 
2017, 
U-M 

researchers 
recognized 
the 

need for “(encouraging) greater 

productive interactions across 

different political orientations 

and ideologies,” and explicitly 

stated, 
“the 
university 
is 

sponsoring a series of events 

focusing on the issue of free 

speech with participants from a 

variety of perspectives.” These 

efforts, if continued, may help 

students — and faculty — to 

become aware and tolerant of 

other ideologies and political 

stances 
and 
create 
a 
more 

inclusive campus environment. 

However, these measures will 

not achieve their desired goals 

if 
political 
discrimination 
is 

allowed to continue at the hands 

of University faculty, staff and 

invited guest lecturers, as these 

groups not only hold positions 

of power, but also serve as role 

models for how students should 

behave in a diverse community. 

I believe positive change is 

possible, 
but 
before 
students 

can be expected to change, the 

University must do its best to 

assure that those at the helm of 

creating our U-M education also 

hold up the standards we set on 

campus.

The problem of intolerance, 

specifically 
in 
the 
collision 

between politics and academia, 

does not only exist at Michigan 

and 
other 
college 
campuses, 

but on a national scale as well. 

Tolerance and understanding is 

often preached by citizens and 

politicians on both sides of the 

aisle, yet, toward their political 

opponents, it is rarely practiced. 

A study conducted by the Pew 

Research Center in June 2016 

found 55 percent of Democrats 

and 49 percent of Republicans 

say they maintain an unfavorable 

attitude toward their opposing 

party. The descriptions most 

commonly used by those in each 

party for those with differing 

views 
were 
“close-minded,” 

“dishonest,” 
“immoral” 
and 

“unintelligent.”

Perhaps the most alarming 

statistic of them all was 45 percent 

of Republicans and 41 percent of 

Democrats said the other party’s 

policies “threaten” the well-being 

of the United States. In a country 

that is at its best when its citizens 

are united, these statistics show 

we have quite a bit of work to do 

in healing our divided society. 

The question arises: What can we 

do about this?

I 
propose 
a 
solution: 

reparation can be achieved by 

creating more opportunities for 

dialogue and interaction between 

people of differing ideological 

persuasions, both as examples 

for — and within — the student 

body. The survey also provided 

one statistic that revealed when 

supporters of the two major 

parties had few to no friends 

from the opposing party, they 

were much more likely to take on 

“very cold” views of their fellow 

citizens. Yet, the opposite proved 

true 
with 
respondents 
who 

reported having “a lot” or “some” 

friends on the other side of the 

ideological spectrum.

Maybe this is where the 

solution lies, nationwide as well 

as at the University of Michigan. 

Organized 
dialogue 
between 

various political organizations 

could potentially significantly 

improve 
inter-group 
political 

relations from the ground up. 

This 
could 
operate 
hand-in-

hand with a continued and easily 

accessible series of speakers with 

diverse perspectives, not just on 

free speech, but on many of the 

wide ranging issues that arise 

in political discourse. It may 

take work to convince the vast 

network of ideological camps to 

emerge from echo chambers and 

open their hearts and minds to 

others, but the positive results 

we could see from a united 

country and campus, seeded 

with tolerance and free thought, 

will hopefully prove such efforts 

fruitful for all.

G

ov. Gretchen Whitmer 
was inaugurated on Jan. 
1, 2019 and she is already 
busy working on a number of 
her campaign promises. From 
fixing the roads to making health 
care easier to access and more 
affordable, 
her 
priorities 
are 
numerous. However, one was 
conspicuously missing from the 
list: occupational licensing reform.
Occupational licensing is the 
concept that people ought to be 
licensed to perform certain jobs. 
In theory, it sounds appealing. 
Who wants a doctor or dentist 
without a license? However, in 
practice, it can (and does) get 
applied to far more mundane 
activities, like shampooers (who 
need a license to literally shampoo 
hair?). Per the Institute of Justice, 
in the state of Michigan, acquiring 
that shampooing license would 
run you about $200 and would 
take 15 days short of a full calendar 
year (1500 clock hours). Driving to 
Indianapolis from Detroit, on the 
other hand, would take you about 
four hours and the state of Indiana 
does not require licensing for such 
a mundane task, which would 
make setting up shop significantly 
less arduous.
There are two other main 
issues 
with 
occupational 
licensing: their disproportionate 
impact on society’s disadvantaged 
and how they lead to regulatory 
capture on an epic scale. It goes 
without saying that the less well-
off have less money to spend on 
acquiring these licenses, but what 
can go under the radar is that this 
effectively locks people out of 
certain career paths for absolutely 
no good reason other than them 
not having exorbitant amounts 
of money to blow on unnecessary 
licenses. In addition, this kind of 
licensing can be very problematic 
from a free market standpoint 
because it leads to regulatory 
capture. Regulatory capture is 
when the government creates an 
agency and it ends up getting taken 
over by those it was supposed to 
regulate, so the agency now acts in 
the best interests of the companies 
represented 
rather 
than 
the 

people. 
This 
happens 
when 
occupational licensing boards are 
led by industry folk. The boards 
then come up with more and 
more onerous regulations that do 
nothing to benefit the people, but 
instead benefit the corporations 
and fatten their wallets along the 
way.
With all of these negatives, 
you might think, is any of this 
necessary? Do people really need 
this much time to learn how to 
shampoo? Do they really need this 
strong of a barrier? The answer is 
no, it is not necessary, and no, we 
don’t need this long to determine 
the art of shampoo, and finally, no, 
we do not need these artificially 
inflated barriers.
You would think the existence 

of 
these 
boards 
would 
be 
beneficial by making work safer, 
but unfortunately, you would 
not be correct. An Obama-era 
Department of Treasury report 
puts it very succinctly: “With the 
caveats that the literature focuses 
on specific examples and that 
quality is difficult to measure, 
most research does not find that 
licensing improves quality or 
public health and safety.” What is 
interesting to note is sometimes 
this kind of licensing can directly 
make people more unsafe. In 
one example discussed by the 
Mercatus Center at George Mason 
University, additional licensing 
restrictiveness 
for 
electricians 
tends to be associated with fewer 
electricians per capita, which is 
associated with more accidental 
electrocutions.
Now, for the good news. 

Former Gov. Rick Snyder made 
a lot of progress in this area by 
creating a new office to focus on 
ending burdensome regulation 
called the Office of Regulatory 
Reinvention, which eventually 
issued a report on the status of 
licensing in Michigan. Nearly 
seven years ago, that report was 
released, and it had a number of 
immediate positive effects and 
a number of burdensome rules 
were cut (including ones that 
regulated barbershop wastebasket 
sizes). Better than the report 
and its changes is a letter the 
governor wrote to the state House 
and Senate leaders, in which he 
eloquently stated his desire to not 
unnecessarily overregulate: “We 
should enact new restrictions 
only when they are absolutely 
necessary to protect the public 
welfare.”
Whitmer has a chance to 
continue this legacy and lend 
it additional support, and she 
should absolutely seize it. Since 
the 2012 report, Snyder slashed 
seven requirements. This may 
seem small, but it represents 
tremendous progress on this front 
and Whitmer should continue 
quickly.
This is a bipartisan issue 
and people all over the political 
spectrum 
are 
working 
to 
make sure this kind of reform 
continues to pick up movement. 
Think tanks as diverse as the R 
Street Institute and the Center 
for American Progress both 
blast 
much 
of 
occupational 
licensing done today because 
many people see the problems 
with it. Those on the right 
can support reform because it 
helps get government out of the 
private sector, and those on the 
left can support reform because 
it helps disadvantaged members 
of society.
Whitmer can become the 
champion of a new generation of 
regulation busters, as the ball is 
in her court.

Governor Whitmer should lead on occupational licensing

It goes without 
saying that the less 
well-off have less 
money to spend 
on acquiring these 
licenses

“Middlesex” by Jeffrey Eugenides is 
so compelling and broad in both genre 
and style that it topped 2003’s bestseller 
lists and won the Pulitzer Prize that 
same year. Critics extolled the novel, 
successfully securing Eugenides a spot 
as a modern classicist and selling him 
over four million copies of the novel 
by 2014. Heralded a modern epic, 
“Middlesex” surveys three bifurcations 
of lineage in the Stephanides family. 
The narrative begins in Greece during 
the First World War, then alternates 
between late 20th-century Detroit and 
modern Berlin, all while tracking the 
history of a gene mutation that leads the 
book’s narrator to be born intersex. 
Indeed, the novel is impressive. A 
masterpiece, even, if a masterpiece is 
allowed a number of marginal flaws. 
It’s difficult not to fall in love with the 
narrator, Cal. His savvy and honest 
voice alternates between second-hand 
storytelling and eclipses of his adult life 
in the first-person. He is both sincere 
and eloquent. Through Cal’s voice, the 
book encompasses so many narrative 
arcs that it almost defies borders. This 
is a feat both difficult to pull off and 
wonderfully done. There are wartime 
tragedies, coming-of-age dramas, car 
chases, family troubles, identity crises 
extravaganza. All while, Eugenides 
succeeds in dealing with the human, 
nuanced-required experience of being 
intersex.
Recently, I loaned my copy of 
“Middlesex” to a friend. This loan was 
on the premonition that they would love 
it, as I’d only had positive responses 
to the book from friends, both literary 
fanatics and non. 
Instead, I was receiving one-in-the-
morning text messages berating the 
harrowed themes of the book. Berating 
the discomfort of what Eugenides placed 
on the page.
Fiction 
is 
not 
supposed 
to 
be 
comfortable. Often, it is. In the case of 
“Middlesex,” not as much. From the start 
of the novel, copious incest is injected 
into Eugenides’s work. The story itself 
is despondent. Moments of light and 
half-happy endings shine through, but in 
most cases, the novel circumvents joy in 
exchange for desperation and slow-burn 
identity crisis. Most of all, nearly every 
main characters is intensely flawed: 
most are ravaged by some marriage 
of addiction, illness, racism, sexism, 
blatant stupidity or complicity. Did I 
mention incest?
Still, when I found that it was the 

moral impairment of “Middlesex” that 
turned off some readers (including my 
friend), I was surprised. When I read 
fiction, rarely am I doing so for — or 
expecting, for that matter — pleasant 
narratives. 
If 
I 
wanted 
pleasant 
narratives, I would read Dr. Seuss or self-
help books. Which is not to disregard the 
authority of the masterful Seuss — these 
books simply stand in entirely different 
fields than “Middlesex.”
Fiction should, and usually will be, 
uncomfortable, flawed and ungracious. 
As Roxane Gay frames it in her essay 
“Not Here to Make Friends,” “(The 
fact that likability exists in literary 
conversation) implies we are engaging 
in courtship. When characters are 
unlikable, they don’t meet our mutable, 
varying standards … merit shouldn’t 
be dictated by whether we want to be 
friends or lovers with those about whom 
we read.” Or, the idea that a book’s 
stature is determined by the likability 
of characters and scenarios is, at best, 
simply absurd. 
Indeed, to soften this, the mere face 
of whether a person “liked” a book — the 
characters, the decisions they made, the 
setting — holds at least some significance. 
Much of reading is subjective. It is up to a 
reader to relate and be moved by a novel.
However, when did discomfort and 
character flaw become the assailant of 
good fiction?
In “Middlesex,” as mentioned, such 
dark 
denominators 
are 
abundant. 
Though just because something is 
discomfiting, or makes us wince — the 
incest between two characters, say, 
or their family members’ decision to 
look away from it — doesn’t mean the 
fiction is bad. In fact, it doesn’t say much 
of anything about the work. Fiction 
labors to dissect the world we live in, to 
magnify its peculiarities, its evils and its 
great joys. Fiction asks “what-if,” and 
these “what-ifs” regularly encompass 
the grotesque and immoral. More often 
than not, these things are happening, or 
have before. This is the case whether or 
not a reader acknowledges such a reality. 
Cal’s grandfather’s unbearable gambling 
and lack of prudence are investigative 
slices of addiction and family that 
make 
“Middlesex” 
so 
poignant. 
Desdemona’s hypocrisy and culpability 
in her family’s misdeeds are thrilling 
surveys into character and personhood, 
about what makes a person human and 
capable of love, and what makes them 
immeasurably flawed at the same time.
Obsessing 
over 
the 
thorny 
characteristics of a novel’s plot is a flawed 
approach to literary appraisal. It is these 
purposeful defects, rather, that make a 
novel like “Middlesex” brave, moving 

and, eventually, critically acclaimed.
“Small Great Things” by Jodi Picoult 
is perhaps the zenith of these malicious 
narratives in fiction. The book is feral. 
Picoult tells the story of a Black nurse who, 
after being barred from administering 
care to a white supremacist family, 
is faced with the difficult decision of 
whether or not to act when their child is 
dying before her. The result, despite her 
intervention, is a lawsuit filed against 
her. Picoult tackles the perspective of 
the nurse, Ruth, as well as her white 

lawyer and the deceased child’s father 
— a white supremacist. While I have 
reservations about the realism of some 
choices (and relationships) in “Small 
Great Things,” it is the perspective of the 
white supremacist that I find the most 
disquieting in the novel. Every dozen 
or so pages, Picoult delves undividedly 
into 
this 
narrative. 
She 
chapters 
violence against Black, queer and Jewish 
people. She holds back little. She crafts 
a character and refuses to do so in a 
subdued manner.
Of course, this is not some attempt to 
offend readers. This berserk extremist, 
Tuck, is grounded in reality (Picoult, in 
fact, went as far as to interview several 
now-amended white supremacists in 
the writing process). It is a horrific, 
loathsome reality that had me taking 
breaks between sections, but a reality 
nonetheless. Radical hate, worldwide, is 
alive and well. Jodi Picoult simply dared 
to write about it. This raises the stakes 
of her novel as a political and cultural 
statement, 
while 
simultaneously 

amplifying the grimness of the depiction 
extended to readers. 
Brand this type of narrative a guilt-
driven call to action, but Picoult’s novel 
still succeeds in providing an essential 
chronicle to culpable white readers. 
In “Small Great Things,” Tuck is 
unequivocally repulsive, but a quieted, 
censored version of him would be, 
perhaps, more offensive. Is it right to ask 
authors to simplify characters? To dumb-
down hate and discomfort — especially 
that which thrives in the folds of our 
own world — simply because we dislike 
it, or because we don’t find it personally 
plausible? These are questions we each 
must answer for ourselves.
If unfriendly characters and their 
narratives are central to a literary 
criticism, an argument of believability 
is generally bound to follow. Meaning: 
The scenarios and people detailed in 
a work are so intolerable or messed 
up or stereotyped that it is absolutely 
implausible that they be laced in a 
universe, fictitious or not.
This is an unfortunate line of thinking. 
The call to believability is an argument 
that 
holds 
little 
weight. 
Indeed, 
sometimes characters do come across 
as contrived — tarnished by logically 
impossible 
situations 
or 
downright 
terrible writing — and this faux plotting 
can make a book unbearable. Many 
times, though, this is not really the case. 
Take, for example, Hanya Yanagihara’s 
“A Little Life.” The novel is a paradigm of 
unlikeable fiction. The work relentlessly 
destroys its characters, which, in turn, 
destroys readers along with them. 
“A Little Life,” at times, seems like 
nothing but sad event after sad event. 
This continent of tragedy comes to a 
peak when one of the main characters, 
already ravaged by myriad relentless 
forces, attempts suicide. The novel is 
not comfortable. Yanigahara gets up 
close and personal with self-harm, rape, 
addiction, sexual identity and domestic 
violence to a nearly unbearable point. 
JB and Jude, two of the main characters, 
are constantly either diabolically self-
destructive or depressed. It is a novel 
that strongly elicits tears from readers.
According to some critics, this plainly 
despondent and uncomfortable narrative 
is apparently unrealistic. Instead of 
rebuking objective choices, critiques fall 
on the fact that the character encounters 
or flaws simply could not have happened. 
That Jude of “A Little Life” could not 
have befallen abuse, physical crippling, 
extreme depression and eventual suicide 
all in one lifetime. There is simply no 
way.
And yet, many of us spend our lives 
in privileged comfort zones. We like 

to assume there is a greater purpose 
to things, that there is generally a 
happy ending. This comes alive as we 
root for characters, as we are shocked 
when tragedy transpires. It’s why 
these uncomfortable narratives seem 
to warrant believability criticism. As 
though, from parlor chairs under a 
reading lamp, readers can dictate how 
pejorative the world can get. As though 
simply because a story doesn’t line-up 
with a politically correct, favorable, 
well-meaning cast of characters and plot 
points we want, it is suddenly unreal. As 
though crime, or indecent acts, are only 
disposed to befall people in twos — never 
threes or fours or fives. 
Granted, there is a responsibility 
that 
falls 
on 
writers. 
Specifically, 
accountability to correctly represent 
populaces, especially those marred 
by imparity or underrepresentation. 
Writers must be keen of the implications 
their depictions have. However, this 
is not to ask for restriction or carbon 
portrayals. I want messy characters. 
I 
want 
flaws 
and 
mistakes 
and 
representations of all kinds of folks. 
The idea that minority characters must 
be represented in a certain threshold of 
perfection is in itself dangerous. Just 
as the faultless woman on television 
doesn’t absolve representation issues, 
the depiction of LGBT characters as 
homogeneously educated, uppity, white 
and sexy is equally as disturbing. It begs 
strange expectations from those who 
encounter these depictions. It represents 
an artificially delightful world to readers, 
when, no matter how we wish it was, our 
world is defective and unpleasant.
An imperfect or stereotyped character 
is not the bane of a novel; in fact, to 
claim so would be to ask for unrealistic, 
brilliant mysticism from authors. People 
have flaws. Characters should be allowed 
flaws, too. There is simply the need for 
continual awareness from authors.
It is in these narratives that readers 
must 
evaluate 
both 
critically 
and 
carefully ranges of plausibility. Readers 
must, when possible, cognize the great 
power of the narrative of discomfort. 
More often than not, it is these depictions 
— those of the nasty, the broken, the 
repulsive and the extreme — that have 
the most to offer. An atrocity in the real 
world does not automate a purposeful, 
equally positive force. We should not 
expect it to in fiction.
The burden of characters and their 
shortcomings are something we must be 
prepared to shoulder each time we read. 
We must allow fiction to fight, question 
and heal, even when these narratives are 
ugly. Such journeys are well worth their 
product.

Bad company: On reading uncomfortable fiction

Netflix is an obvious go-to for any 
holiday movie-watching. But for me, 
the streaming service had an especially 
strong draw over winter break. It 
seemed like whenever I caught up with 
the latest Netflix release, a new one 
materialized the next day.
By the time I finally got around 
to watching “Bird Box,” my Twitter 
had already been flooded with its 
reliably funny memes — particularly 
Sandra Bullock blindfolded on a canoe 
— so by that point I didn’t so much 
care about the movie as I did about 

understanding the source of these 
quips. The movie itself, well, couldn’t 
have been much worse. It wasn’t 
even the best sensory horror creature 
feature of the year. It was little more 
than a breathless Bullock doing her 
best to enliven a laughably dull script.
Another Netflix disappointment was 
“Bandersnatch.” The latest installment 
in 
the 
“Black 
Mirror” 
anthology 
series is notable for its interactivity, 
allowing viewers to make decisions 
on 
characters’ 
actions 
throughout 
its duration. Naturally, the episode’s 
myriad outcomes — some far stranger 
than others — were a magnetic topic 
of discussion between my friends and 
me for days. The tediously self-aware 
experiment felt weighed down and at 
times just nonsensical.
However, December was not all let-
downs for Netflix. Of course, there 
was “Roma”; though not a Netflix 
Original, the film was made available 
for streaming via the service and also 

released in theatres. Alfonso Cuaron’s 
evocative remembrance of his Mexico 
City upbringing immediately became 
not only one of my favorite films of 
the year, but some of the best work I 
have seen from the writer-director. 
“Roma” is saturated with beauty and 
meaningful symbolism. It’s Cuaron’s 
whole heart.
Break also provided ample time 
to rewatch a throng of other films, 
often with friends and family. Some 
highlights include “Rounders” (the 
best poker movie of all time), starring 
vintage Matt Damon and Ed Norton, 
“Harry Potter and the Prisoner of 
Azkaban,” 
another 
masterpiece 
of Cuaron’s and “School of Rock,” 
arguably one of the most quotable films 
ever.

Winter break is a time for recharging, 
relaxing, and for me, re-watching. 

Over the break, I re-watched several 
of my favorite films, from classics to 
guilty pleasures. Christmas came and 
went, and with it two beloved holiday 
rom-coms: “The Holiday” and “Love, 
Actually.” They are the kind of movies 
that make your insides feel like a 
nice hot cocoa, warm and sweet. One 
reminds you that romance is possible. 
The other that Jude Law is sexy.
To balance out the gushiness, I had 
to take some drastic measures. You 
guessed it: thriller time. Whenever I 
get dreary with the state of rom-coms, 
I like to drown myself in morgue-porn 
thrillers as a reminder that life is not 
only full of love, but also murder. I 
re-watched one of my favorites, “The 
Silence of the Lambs,” while practicing 
my Jodie Foster impression (it needs 
work). And I have to say, after seeing 
the film over 15 times, it really never 
gets old — does it, Clarice? I took on 
Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” for the 
second time and I will not deny that 
Anthony Perkins 
as Norman Bates 
is a snack and 
a half. So if you 
thought 
Penn 
Badgley’s 
Joe 
Goldberg in “You” 
was 
the 
first 
psychotic hottie, 
you 
are 
sorely 
mistaken.
To 
end 
the 
break on a high 
note, I spent the 
last 
few 
days 
re-watching 
a 
selection of my 
favorite comedies. 
After missing out 
on his one-man 
show on Broadway 
(“The New One”), 
I watched Mike 
Birbiglia’s ode to 

improv, 
“Don’t 
Think 
Twice.” 
It 
was the first time I’ve seen it since 
becoming an improviser myself and 
I must say, it hit much closer to home 
this time around. It is a heartfelt look at 
success and friendship, and the improv 
— even if it is scripted — is pretty great. 
Finally, I re-watched my absolute, all-
time, number one, favorite McFavorite 
film, “Clueless.” I knew every burn, 
bang and bruise in the 1995 classic way 
before Iggy got biggy in her “Fancy” 
video or Dove Cameron starred in 
the off-Broadway musical of the same 
name.

Most of my interactions 
with 
other 
humans 
these 
days — more often than not 
— are centered around “The 
Marvelous 
Mrs. 
Maisel.” 
Have I seen it? What do I 
think about it? It’s about a 
Jewish, 
female 
comedian, 
that’s like all of your defining 
attributes! You must love this 
show, correction: live this 
show. No, I am not an absent 
mother in 1950s New York 
City working as a stand-up 
comedian, but I am writing 
this column dressed in a 
smart turtleneck tucked into 
sophisticated trousers, with 
a homemade brisket in one 
hand and a slender cigarette 
in the other. So no, I am not 
Midge, but I am pretty damn 
close. 
Amy 
Sherman-Palladino’s 
brilliant series has a very 
special place in my heart, 
right 
between 
coffee 
and 
Nick Kroll. The witty banter, 
the expertly crafted stand-
up routines, the smattering 
of Yiddishisms — I swear it 
feels like Amy is spying on 
me. OK, so I’m not buddies 
with Lenny Bruce or some 
reimaging of him, and you’re 
right, I’m not actually from 
New York. I’ve only ever lived 
in Ohio. And you would be 
correct if you reminded me 
that I do not in fact measure 
myself on a regular basis, but 
I can prove I have other body 
issues, I promise. No, I have 
never made a brisket myself, 
but I’ve eaten many cooked by 
my mother and grandmother 
and I think I could knock out 
a pretty good one if given the 
right kitchen and the right 
circumstances. 
No, I’ve never actually tried 
my hand at stand-up comedy. 
Why, 
you 
ask? 
Is 
it 
my 
crippling anxiety and fear of 

failure? Perhaps it’s that I’ve 
never had the opportunity 
or desire to try it. Maybe 
it’s because I am not funny. 
Maybe it’s because I am an 
alien 
disguised 
in 
human 
clothing, tricking everyone 
around me into thinking I 
am a real person and the 
only way to reveal myself as I 
truly am is to perform stand-
up comedy. Or maybe I’m 
just scared shitless. That is 

another column for another 
time, dear reader. 
Self-pity aside, Mrs. Maisel 
and Ms. Sherman-Palladino 
have made a beautiful thing 
together. The show makes 
me feel seen and I’m sure 
scores of others feel similarly. 
Watching a neurotic Jewish 
comedian tell jokes and win 
Emmys and Golden Globes 
for it makes me kvell like 
my 
grandmother 
during 
graduations. But as much as 
I love the character of Midge, 
I 
have 
to 
remind 
myself 
that she is not real. Midge is 
more like the construction 
of 
a 
Jewish 
comedy 
Frankenstein, assembled with 
the spunk of Joan Rivers, 
the rebelliousness of Lenny 
Bruce and the bad-assery of 
Fanny Brice. She takes men 
down with her pinky finger 
and irreverent wit, all while 

looking like a mannequin at B. 
Altman. Midge is what I’d be 
if I were a skinnier unfiltered 
version of myself. But I guess 
that’s why I aspire to be her. 
It took me far too long to 
reach the conclusion that I 
am not Midge Maisel. I think 
I became so absorbed in it, 
bingeing every episode with 
a fistful of macaroons (The 
Jewish ones not the French 
ones), that it became all too 
easy to replace my boring 
life with her exciting arcs. At 
points I even felt jealous of 
her. She is out in the world, 
making 
her 
name 
known 
while simultaneously banging 
a hot doctor she bagged in the 
Catskills. What a score!
People laugh at what she has 
to say because she makes them 
pay attention. She stands in 
the spotlight like she was born 
there, a sort of comfort I can 
only relate to my bed. Midge 
is creation of Amy Sherman-
Palladino’s imagination; an 
amalgamation 
of 
borscht 
belt heroes with breasts; a 
Jewish Lorelai Gilmore with 
a microphone.
Coming 
to 
terms 
with 
the fiction of Midge is both 
liberating and terrifying. On 
one hand, it is a reminder 
that her authors crafted her 
because she is a character 
worth writing, seeing and 
hearing. She is an imaginary 
representation of Jewishness, 
femininity 
and 
humor 
reflective of her very real 
predecessors. On the other 
hand, perhaps Midge only 
exists in the realm of fantasy 
and I am kidding myself trying 
to become some version of 
her. But maybe that’s OK. No, 
I am not Midge Maisel and I 
don’t think I should try to be. 
I am Becky Portman, and I am 
damn happy with that.

Gillian 
Anderson 
(“The 
X-Files”) 
could 
read 
the 
Maricopa County phonebook 
for eight hours and it would 
probably be the most riveting 
television 
of 
the 
year. 
Instead, 
probably 
for 
the 
better, she has opted to star in 
Netflix’s splendid new “Sex 
Education,” a British coming-
of-age 
dramedy 
brimming 
with charm and sincerity — 
and yes, considerably better 
than the phonebook.
Lovely 
as 
it 
is, 
“Sex 
Education” 
isn’t 
for 
the 
puritanical. 
If 
the 
snort-
inducing, 
did-they-really-
just-say-that, risqué Anglo 
humor 
doesn’t 
offend 
your 
delicate 
American 
sensibilities, its inclination 
toward the gross and graphic 
— on display from the opening 
scene 
— 
almost 
certainly 
will. It’s raunchy, explicit 
and totally unapologetic. But 
more importantly, it’s smart 
and 
bracingly 
thoughtful, 
with plenty of heart. And 
also, um, some other organs.
Anderson’s Jean Milburn 
is a progressive sex and 
relationship 
therapist 
and 
doting single mother to Otis 
(Asa 
Butterfield, 
“Hugo”), 
a 
perpetually 
mortified, 
neuroses-ridden 16-year-old 
so disturbed by his mother’s 
line of work that he can 
hardly stand to think about 
intercourse, let alone do the 
deed. A certain Philip Larkin 
poem about parents comes to 
mind: “They fuck you up, your 
mum and dad / They may not 
mean to, but they do.” When 
school bully Adam (Connor 

Swindells, “The Vanishing”) 
comes over one day to work on 
a class project, Otis whizzes 
about the house sweeping for 
any lingering phallic statutes 
or 
framed 
Kama 
Sutra 
illustrations that might give 
his mother away.
Alas, to no avail. Adam 
stumbles 
into 
the 
wrong 
room — Jean’s private office 
— and in that horrible teen 
movie 
way, 
Otis’s 
secret 
quickly becomes the talk of 

the hallways. The renegade 
Maeve (newcomer and Margot 
Robbie dead ringer Emma 
Mackey), 
entrepreneurial 
and 
fearsomely 
beautiful, 
suggests to Otis that he turn 
his shame into something 
of a hustle, using what he’s 
gathered from being raised 
by Jean to help his sex-crazed 
schoolmates 
sort 
through 
their 
own 
relationship 
problems.
Butterfield’s Otis is the 

rare, 
refreshing 
on-screen 
nice guy who isn’t a Nice Guy. 
Earnest, sweet and impossible 
not to root for, he shares his 
mother’s patience and care in 
being non-judgmental. And 
he’s surrounded by an equally 
winsome supporting cast in 
Mackey’s Maeve and openly-
gay best friend Eric (Ncuti 
Gatwa, “Stonemouth”), both 
of whom are given their fair 
share of screen time.
“Sex Education” is littered 
with 
high 
school 
tropes 
— 
there 
are 
swim 
team 
jocks, catty cliques, lunch 
money 
robberies 
and 
so 
forth. But the show nicely 
subverts those by showcasing 
everyone’s 
vulnerabilities. 
It 
will 
inevitably 
draw 
comparisons to other teen 
television in Netflix’s arsenal 
of originals: the transgressive 
drama of “13 Reasons Why,” 
the 
melancholy-punctuated 
breeziness of “On My Block,” 
the 
referential 
satire 
of 
“American 
Vandal.” 
Still, 
though, “Sex Education” feels 
like something we haven’t 
seen before. That’s true on 
a literal level: It’s shot like a 
clever, colorful period piece 
— what the romantic comedy 
might 
look 
like 
if 
John 
Hughes swapped Chicagoland 
for the expansive English 
countryside. But it’s also clear 
in a greater, thematic sense: 
As ABC airs a season of “The 
Bachelor” intent on breaking 
the Guinness World Record 
for Most Virginity Jokes Made 
in an Hour, “Sex Education” 
stands out as television that 
could so easily be cruel, but 
instead makes the braver, 
much more interesting choice 
to be positive, affirming and 
joyful.

Becoming Midge Maisel

Fun Fact: I discovered who Randy 
Houser was last night. I read up a bit about 
him on Wikipedia, and (spoiler) he’s no 
Taylor Swift, but apparently he’s a bit of 
a hot shot in the country community. He 
has had a few top-20 country hits, decent 
airplay and a neck beard going for him. 
However, he’s not particularly fond of his 
accomplishments over the last decade. 
In a recent interview with Billboard, he 
reflected on the progression of his music, 
stating that “It started to feel like that it 
wasn’t about music as much anymore as it 
was just entertainment.”
As the quote suggests, Houser’s most 
recent fifth studio album Magnolia is 
meant to distance itself from mainstream 
country 
appeal. 
I 
sampled 
some 
of 
Houser’s older music to get a feel for what 
this could possibly mean. Less cowbell? 
More narrative based cuts rather than 
braggadocious drinking anthems? Or is 
it all just a marketing ploy? Whatever it’s 
supposed to be, I hoped I would catch on to 
it for this review’s sake.
It didn’t take more than a few seconds 
into the first song, “No Stone Unturned,” 
to understand what exactly makes this a 
“different” country album. An introspective 
ode to self-discovery, the track serves 
as the perfect introductory piece to this 
album, effortlessly wafting into various 
rights of passages throughout Houser’s life, 
from leaving home to pursue his dreams in 
Nashville to having his heart broken for the 
first time. It glistens under its instrumental, 

building from slow, gentle guitar plucking 
to spaced-out drum beats and a faint bass 
in the chorus. It did not take long for the 
album to prove my assumptions — that it 
would be 48 minutes of shit — wrong. 
Unlike 
much 
of 
Houser’s 
previous 
work, Magnolia strives for an appeal that 
is strictly nostalgic. Whereas past tracks 
like “Anything Goes” or “Like a Cowboy” 
only ever reflect as far back as a recent 
one-night stand, Magnolia is willing to 
linger in experiences and emotions that 
trail farther behind Houser’s timeline. 
We get glimmers and pieces of a Houser 
before all the Nashville glitz washed over 
him. This heralds a return to a sound that 
is more traditionally country and a nod 
to his Mississippi roots, down to the very 
title; Houser’s late grandmother was buried 
under a magnolia tree.
This isn’t to say that Magnolia is a sappy, 
emotional conglomerate of redemption 
tracks that mourn a simpler past. The album 
samples a broad spectrum of emotions from 
the mundane to the memorable. Tracks such 
as the overly-sentimental “No Good Place 
to Cry” (which is just as emo as it sounds) 
perfectly display Houser’s bluesy crooning 
as he channels his emotions over faint piano 
notes in the background that play into brief 
moments of silence. Similarly, peppier cuts 
on the album such as harmonica-laden 
“Whole Lotta Quit” provide a necessary 
energy, as Houser details his desire to 
abandon his arduous blue-collar job and get 
high with his friends. The album ends on a 
gracious note, with the song “Evangeline” 
reminiscing on a past love that didn’t quite 
work out but is still memorable by virtue of 
its emotional value.

Regardless of the topic or emotion 
conveyed, this album carries itself as a 
cohesive piece not only in its nostalgic 
energies but its deliberate detailing. Not 
a single element feels contrived, forced 
or spared as the album makes skillful use 
of its negative space, letting melodies 
fall to moments of silence and building 
them back up. It follows a unique pattern, 
dedicating more lavish tracks to the middle 
of the album, those more restrained to the 

beginning and end.
As 
someone 
very 
unfamiliar 
with 
country, I can tell you that Magnolia is a 
spectacle worth considering for its sheer 
emotional value. It doesn’t run the risk 
of being overly sappy despite its case as a 
redemption album of sorts. It shows that to 
be emotional doesn’t necessarily mean to 
be sentimental; sometimes it’s just a matter 
of appreciating the experiences that have 
passed.

Once a forward, Nick Blankenburg finding his footing at a new position

Brian Burke had a problem.
It 
was 
halfway 
through 
the season, and one of the 
defensemen had left his Victory 
Honda major midget hockey 
team — based in Plymouth, 
Mich. — to go play junior hockey 
elsewhere. The Victory Honda 
coach needed a defenseman to 
fill that spot, and he needed one 
fast.
In 2016, Nick Blankenburg 
— then 18 years 
old 
and 
now 
a 
freshman 
at 
Michigan — was 
a 
forward 
on 
that team, but he 
had a hard time 
scoring. 
Burke 
decided 
to 
try 
Blankenburg 
at 
defense for the 
first time in his 
life.
After 
Blankenburg 
talked 
over the decision with his older 
brother Alex, a goaltender for the 
University of Nebraska-Omaha, 
he decided to dive into the new 
position.
“I was definitely hesitant for 
a little bit,” Blankenburg said. 
“I kind of sat — my brother, my 
older brother plays hockey too, 
so he helped me out a lot with 
the decision. I kind of talked to 
him and just kind of figured out 
what I wanted to do. I ended 
up making the decision to (play 
defense) and I don’t regret it at 
all.”
While he had never played 
any position other than forward 
at the time, Blankenburg saw 
defenseman as his path to junior 
hockey and, eventually, a spot on 
a Division I college roster.
And when it came time to 
learn his new skills, Burke said 
Blankenburg was ready to go 
right from the beginning.
“He was all in, right from the 
start,” Burke said in a phone 
interview. 
“Fully 
committed 
to 
just 
playing. 
He 
didn’t 
really hesitate or have any 

apprehension. He just jumped 
feet first, went after it and he did 
a real nice job.”
That commitment paid off.
Blankenburg’s 
success 
on 
defense with Victory Honda led 
to him getting a spot with the 
Okotoks Oilers of the Alberta 
Junior Hockey League — quite 
a change for a high-schooler 
who had spent his whole life 
playing for metro Detroit-based 
teams. Suddenly he was moving 
nearly 2,000 miles northwest 
to Okotoks, a city just south of 
Calgary.
“Coming 
up 
here, he didn’t 
know 
anyone,” 
said Oilers coach 
Tyler Deis in a 
phone interview. 
“It’s 
a 
new 
environment, 
coming 
to 
Canada and not 
knowing 
very 
many 
people. 
He’s a very sociable kid. He 
interacts really well. … It was 
a really easy transformation 
to integrate him into here just 
because of the social part of 
him.”
And it was while he was playing 
for the Oilers that Blankenburg 
caught the attention of Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson.
Daniel Farrell — who coached 
the Wolverines from 1973 to 1980 
— had seen Blankenburg play at 
some point and passed the name 
along to Pearson, then the coach 
at Michigan Tech.
“When 
I 
got 
down 
(to 
Michigan), 
I 
kept 
following 
the kid and seeing his stats,” 
Pearson said. “I was like, ‘Oh, 
this kid’s pretty good, putting 
up a lot of numbers for a 
defenseman.’ That’s how we got 
on (Blankenburg).”
And in December 2017, just 
about a year after deciding to 
switch to defense, Blankenburg’s 
decision 
paid 
off 
when 
he 
committed to play for Pearson 
at Michigan. He had achieved 
his goal of earning a spot on a 
Division I roster.

Now, Blankenburg — at 5-foot-
9 and 160 pounds — is one of 
the Wolverines’ most important 
blueliners. He’s spent most of the 
season on the second defensive 

pairing, but when sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 
missed four games because of the 
World Junior Championships, 
Blankenburg 
moved 
into 
Hughes’ spot on the top pairing 
with senior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi.
“We had seven defensemen 
we really liked, we thought were 
playing well,” Pearson said. “You 
usually only like to play six, so 
when Quinn left, it was a little 
decision (about) who to play with 
(Cecconi).
“We put (Blankenburg) there 
because he’s a lot like Quinn in 
some of the skating, the puck 
handling and whatnot. So much 
like — well, in his mannerisms. 
Hopefully (Blankenburg) gets 
about half as good as (Hughes).”
Comparisons to Hughes — 

who was the No. 7 overall pick in 
the 2018 NHL Draft — are lofty 
for anyone. They’re especially 
lofty for a freshman with less 
than 100 games as a defenseman.

But it seems they may be apt.
As 
a 
less-experienced 
defenseman, 
Blankenburg 
is 
always looking to learn from his 
fellow blueliners.
“I think I can either be more 
stubborn about it and just kind 
of do my own thing or I can look 
up to those guys and I do look up 
to all those guys,” Blankenburg 
said. “I watch them, and I try 
to learn from them every single 
day.”
And the one he learns from the 
most is Hughes.
“I think everyone says this, 
but I think you just can learn 
a lot from Quinn with what he 
does with the puck and when he 
does have it, how he’s just so, so 
calm,” Blankenburg said. “The 
things he can do with the puck 
(are) just insane.

“You try to — not try to play 
like him, but you try to learn 
those little details that he has. 
I mean, it’s a special talent and 
a special gift. I try to work on 

those little things every single 
day, so I can be more effective 
with the puck to create, in the 
long run, more offense.”
You would think that because 
of his experience as a forward, 
Blankenburg would be lighting 
up the stat sheet offensively. But 
in 22 games played, he has only 
one goal and four assists for five 
total points.
Though 
having 
skills 
as 
a forward is helpful in the 
transition, learning the type 
of 
offense 
that 
a 
two-way 
defenseman 
is 
expected 
to 
contribute is more complicated 
than 
just 
transferring 
his 
previous experience.
“He’s got some savvy with the 
puck and he’s got quick feet,” 
Pearson said. “I thought he 
would maybe have a few more 

points than he does because of 
those offensive tendencies when 
he was a forward. Those are 
some of the things you see.”
Two years ago, when Burke 

decided that Blankenburg might 
be successful as a defenseman, 
one of the key parts of that 
decision was the strength of 
Blankenburg’s shot.
Against Notre Dame on Jan. 5 
— one of the games Blankenburg 
played 
with 
Cecconi 
— 
he 
unleashed 
a 
cannon 
of 
a 
slapshot. It caught the post, but 
it showed signs that the skills he 
developed as a forward may be 
starting to come through in his 
relatively new role as a two-way 
defenseman.
Blankenburg originally made 
the switch to try to get on a 
Division I hockey team. 
But as he continues to learn 
from 
Hughes 
and 
develop 
at 
Michigan, 
Blankenburg’s 
transition to defense may bring 
him to even greater heights.

The story of Stormy Kromer, Mel 
Pearson and Michigan’s novelty hats

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
wore it behind the bench at Notre 
Dame Stadium on Jan. 5. As the 
players took off their gear and 
changed into their street clothes, 
they slipped it on as well.
It was a Stormy Kromer hat.
“It’s a unique cap,” Pearson 
said. “And a unique story behind 
the cap.”
The 
story 
began 
in 
1903 
with 
George 
Kromer 
— 
nicknamed 
“Stormy” — who 
was 
a 
semi-
professional 
baseball 
player 
who later became 
a 
railroad 
engineer.
“We had to do a little research 
on it,” said freshman forward 
Nolan Moyle. “It’s got a little 
history 
message 
inside. 
It’s 
basically about Stormy Kromer, 
he’s kind of a railroad worker, 
whose hat kept falling off so they 
sewed the flaps onto the side, 
and it’s a pretty good old-school 
look.”

After losing many hats to 
the wind on the locomotive he 
worked on, Kromer requested his 
wife to sew a hat that would not 
only stay on his head but keep it 
warm. So she took a baseball cap, 
sewed on a higher crown and 
added ear flaps to a pull-down 
earband.
The popularity of the hats 
pushed Kromer and his wife 
to take their small hometown 
production 
to 
a 
factory 
in 
Milwaukee, 
Wisc. 
with 
upwards of 30 
workers.
The expansion 
took off and over 
100 years later, 
it found its way 
to 
Ironwood, 
Mich. — a place 
not too far from 
Michigan Tech, where Pearson 
had spent years coaching.
“I spent a lot of years in the 
(Upper Peninsula),” Pearson said. 
“They’re very popular up there. 
They’re a very unique brand of 
cap and obviously a Michigan 
company.”
Upon returning from winter 
break, Pearson wanted to surprise 

the team with a present for the 
holidays as well as something 
special for the upcoming outdoor 
game in South Bend.
“Usually around that you get 
something different to wear,” 
Pearson said. “And I thought, 
hey you know what, give them 
sort of the Christmas gift and 
the outdoor ‘Let’s take it outside’ 
game. It’s amazing.”
Upon request, the company 
Pearson approached made it a 
priority to finish the product in 
time for the game.
“I found out that the general 
manager up there in Ironwood, 
Michigan considers himself the 
biggest Michigan hockey fan in 
the Upper Peninsula,” Pearson 
said. “So when they heard we 
wanted to do this, they really 
wanted to do this. They rushed 
them. They almost became a 
personal mission for them to 
see this through so it’s pretty 
exciting.”
Pearson had the block ‘M’ 
sewn on the side and the players’ 
numbers added to the front. On 
the bench and in the locker room, 
players and coaches alike donned 
the cap.
And with it, they took South 
Bend in style.

‘M’ looks for big wins in final stretch

When the Michigan women’s 
basketball team walked off the 
court at the Xfinity Center on 
Monday night in College Park, 
it was left wondering what had 
gone wrong. It had allowed a 
one-point deficit heading into the 
fourth quarter to balloon into a 
14-point loss.
The Wolverines outrebounded 
No. 
9 
Maryland 
and 
put 
themselves in a position to win 
by collecting 18 offensive boards 
compared to just seven for the 
Terrapins — the eighth-best 
rebounding team in the nation. 
Then, the defense collapsed, 
allowing 
Maryland 
to 
shoot 
77 percent from the floor and 
75 percent from deep in the 
final period while giving up its 
rebounding advantage.
This is no anomaly. Instead, 
it encapsulates what has been 
an up and down season for the 
Wolverines thus far. 
“Our 
defense 
is 
definitely 
a work in progress and that’s 
something that we are continuing 
to try and improve, sending (less) 
people to the free throw line,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I think the last few games 
we’ve done a much better job of 
that, but we have taken notice of 
that.”

A big reason for Michigan’s 
defensive struggles, especially 
late in games, is youth. While 
youth has long-term advantages, 
the lack of experience has hurt 
the Wolverines late in games 
when trying to hold a narrow lead 
or close a slim deficit.
“Well they say defense wins 
championships and we really 
pride ourselves on that here,” said 
senior guard Nicole Munger. “ … I 
think we’re just really focused on 
getting better every single day at 
defense and getting little things, 
like extra possessions, through 
charges, loose balls, rebounds and 
just really trying to lock into our 
scouts. We’ve shown the ability 
(against) like Missouri, Maryland 
for the first half, of being able to 
really shut down opponents, we 
just need to be able to out a full 40 
minutes together.”
That 
youth 
has 
also 
led 
to struggles in hostile road 
environments. 
Michigan 
has 
won just four times in its 10 
games away from Crisler Center, 
and without any notable road 
wins, the Wolverines will have 
a hard time making the NCAA 
Tournament. 
“I think that we just need 
to lock in and, like I said, do 
everything a little bit better (on 
the road),” Munger said. “You’re 
not going to have your refs or, like 
I said, your crowd, but that’s why 

you got to be a little bit better at 
every single thing.”
Thus far, Michigan has faced 
five ranked teams, four of them 
on the road. To little surprise, 
the Wolverines have lost all 
four of those games. But, for 
Barnes Arico, those losses have 
a silver lining — they provide a 
learning experience that will 
help the young players gain the 
skills they need to succeed away 
from Ann Arbor. That starts in 
Iowa City with a contest against 
the 22nd-ranked Hawkeyes on 
Thursday.
If it can learn from its previous 
road contests, Michigan is capable 
of snatching a few key road wins 
down the final stretch. 
“I think our schedule, even 
before Big Ten play, has been 
incredibly tough,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We’ve played against some 
of the best teams in the country. 
Whether that’s Texas or NC State, 
who I think is the only undefeated 
team left, and all of those games 
have been on the road. And then 
to head into Big Ten play and now 
have four of our first six on the 
road has really been challenging. 
“But we keep trying to put a 
positive spin on it, that it is going 
to prepare us for February, that it 
is going to prepare us for March 
and Big Ten play and the Big Ten 
Tournament when we will have 
to be at a neutral court.”

“I was 
definitely 
hesitant for a 
little bit.”

“They almost 

became a 

personal mission 

for them.”

Hughes, Norris return from World Juniors with experience in hand

Josh 
Norris 
and 
Quinn 
Hughes were no strangers to U20 
World Juniors. It was only one 
year ago the sophomore forwards 
had both appeared in it together 
for Team USA, earning a bronze 
medal.
Returning to the scene once 
more — this time in Vancouver 
and Victoria, Ont. — they had 
their eyes set on gold.
“It was obviously a lot of 
fun anytime you can go and 
represent your country,” Norris 
said. “Obviously that’s a pretty 
big tournament and something 
that you grow up dreaming about 
playing in.”
The duo ended with eight 
points and a plus-minus of nine 
between the two. Their impacts, 
however, were more than just on 
the stat sheet.
“It’s nice having a familiarity 
there with Josh,” Hughes said 

to SiriusXM. “I kind of know 
what he likes to do and I’m sure 
he knows what I like to do so 
whenever we’re out on the ice, 
it’s easier.”
After a slow start that ended in 
a narrow 2-1 win over Slovakia, 
Hughes 
emphasized 
USA’s 
growth and unity 
as a team.
“For 
us, 
we 
just got to keep 
building 
every 
game,” 
Hughes 
said to SiriusXM. 
“I 
think 
from 
the 
first 
game 
to the end of the 
tournament, we’ll 
be a completely 
different 
team. 
So us every day we just got 
to continue getting better so 
hopefully for today’s game we’re 
better today than two days ago.”
Hughes 
and 
Norris 
were 
named alternate captains before 
the start of the tournament, 

putting a bigger burden on them 
than just playing their best. They 
had to be leaders.
“You can have different kind 
of leaders,” Hughes said. “I think 
for me, just working really hard 
on the ice and showing that you 
really care, and that’s what I kind 
of attract to.”
The 
team 
got after it in 
the 
following 
match 
against 
Kazakhstan, 
ending 
in 
a 
dominant 
8-2 
win. 
Hughes 
contributed 
an 
assist 
to 
take 
the 
lead 
after 
Kazakhstan 
tied the game at one apiece. He 
sparked the power play goal after 
drawing the defense by passing 
the puck back and forth across 
the blue line. Norris tallied 
an assist and the eighth and 
final goal of the game to cap a 
commanding performance.
Even 
after 
the 
beatdown, 
Norris thought the team hadn’t 
reached its full potential. It 
wasn’t until the following game, 
against Sweden, that he saw 
the team grow. After allowing a 
three-goal deficit through two 
periods, Team USA looked out of 
sorts as it allowed in a fourth goal 
minutes after the third period 
started.
However, the 
team scored four 
unanswered 
goals to tie the 
game — one of 
which came off 
a Hughes assist 
— and pushed it 
into 
overtime, 
where the team 
ultimately failed 
to 
secure 
the 
comeback win.
Despite the close loss, Norris 
says that game will stick with 
him.
“I think the Sweden game, 
our round robin game against 
Sweden, we were down 4-1 with 
eight minutes left, and (St. Cloud 
State forward Jake Poehling) hit 
three in the last eight minutes 
and that was pretty crazy.
“That kind of gave our team 

a little bit of life, and right after 
that game is where we took off. 
We all kind of believed in each 
other a little bit more, that was 
probably the moment that stuck 
out to me.”
Norris would add an assist 
and a game-winning goal in the 
team’s subsequent wins over 
Finland and Czech Republic, 4-1 
and 3-1, respectively.
He 
also 
generated 
multiple scoring 
opportunities in 
the 
semifinals 
against 
Russia 
that ended in a 
2-1 win for USA.
“It 
was 
the 
first time in the 
tourney 
people 
were 
actually 
cheering 
for 
us,” joked U.S. 
National 
Team 
Development 
program player Jack Hughes to 
SiriusXM after the match.
Despite his solid performance 
throughout, 
Norris’ 
biggest 
achievement was in the final 
match Jan. 5 against Finland. The 
team had dug a 2-0 hole and after 
50 minutes of play, the deficit 
was cut to only one. Hitting a 
one-timer from the right circle, 

Norris scored the equalizer that 
rejuvenated not only the players 
on the ice but the entire bench.
“Everyone was really excited 
because we were down two 
nothing to a really good team,” 
Quinn Hughes said. “It’s hard to 
score goals in that tournament, 
so when he scored you could just 
feel the energy on the bench and 
in the stadium, that it was tied up 
and we were all really excited.
“There was a confidence on 
the bench that once we tied it up, 
we’d be OK.”
Added 
Norris: 
“It 
was 
obviously a pretty big momentum 
change and probably one of the 
biggest goals I’ve ever scored and 
I was on a high there for 15, 20 
seconds.”
Team USA went on to lose the 
match 3-2, earning a silver medal.
But 
despite 
being 
unable 
to 
secure 
the 
victory, 
the 
tournament offered Hughes and 
Norris a change of pace from 
college hockey.
“The NCAA’s pretty tough,” 
Hughes said to the Victoria 
media group. “You’re playing 
24-25 year old men actually, and 
the guys aren’t as strong, but 
you’re playing more elite players 
so sometimes they’re a little bit 
more skilled.”

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Sophomore defenseman Quinn Hughes competed alongside teammate Josh Norris at the World Junior Championships.

“I know I’m capable of knocking down those shots”: The terrifying 
proposition of Jon Teske, the 3-point shooter, and how it became possible

Jon Teske stood at the free-
throw line with Eli Brooks 
about five feet to his right. 
The two operated in tandem — 
Teske dropping back behind the 
3-point line to where Brooks 
once stood, Brooks vacating his 
original position to seal off two 
defenders with a screen at the 
stripe.
Next came the pass from 
junior guard Zavier Simpson. 
Then came the shot by Teske. 
Then came the sound of ball 
catching nylon.
Then it happened again.
Two minutes later, Brooks 
drove the lane, drawing Teske’s 
defender to help. Teske stepped 
back across the arc and fired 
away. The ball rattled home. 

The next possession saw the 
exact same play and the exact 
same result.
Here was Brooks, a 6-foot-
1, 185-pound guard, setting an 
off-ball 
screen 
to 
spring 
his 
7-foot-1 
center 
for a 3-pointer. 
Here 
was 
the 
center 
setting 
up and knocking 
it down delay-
free. Here was 
Teske, who had 
hit just five treys 
in 
his 
career 
before 
Sunday, 
hitting three in the first half 
alone.
Michigan’s 
80-60 
win 
Sunday 
over 
Northwestern 
did not actually take place in 
a parallel universe, although 

it may have seemed that way 
for those 150 seconds. Nor did 
Teske somehow switch bodies 
with a certain tall, sweet-
shooting Los Angeles Lakers 
rookie, even if 
that may have 
appeared to be 
the case too.
No, this was 
Jon Teske, all 85 
inches and 260 
pounds of him, 
doing 
exactly 
what many have 
long hoped he’d 
be doing.
Teske 
shot 
3-pointers 
at 
Medina 
High 
School in Ohio. But in Ann 
Arbor, the anticipation started 
last 
spring, 
when 
Moritz 
Wagner and his 110 career 
threes departed for the NBA 

Draft and was drafted by the 
Lakers. Of all the off-season 
storylines 
surrounding 
the 
Wolverines, Teske’s improved 
outside stroke was one of the 
most prominent. It was the 
intrigue of something unseen 
and the allure of yet another 
behemoth gunning teams down 
from deep. If Teske’s shooting 
was as accurate as hyped, 
Michigan’s pick-and-pop game 
— so deadly with Wagner as an 
outlet — wouldn’t miss a beat.
“Jon Teske has shot the ball 
really well (in practice),” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
on Sept. 25. “Having a big man 
that can shoot, you all see what 
can happen, it made everybody 
else better last year. Having Jon 
be able to do that … (that’s) big 
to get those big men that can 
shoot.”

Added Teske: “Now that 
Moe’s gone, it’s my turn to 
step up. And I think with my 
capability shooting the three, I 
can really stretch the floor and 
help us win games.”
Teske has indeed helped 
the Wolverines win games in 
many ways, but 
until 
Sunday, 
shooting wasn’t 
exactly 
among 
them.
In 
his 
two-
plus 
years 
on 
campus, Teske’s 
grown 
from 
a 
whistle-prone 
freshman 
into 
a 
mature 
rim 
protector 
who 
keeps his arms up and defends 
without fouling. In his first 
season, he committed 6.7 fouls 
per 40 minutes. This year, he’s 
sliced that rate in half.
Teske once ran out of energy 
quickly, but he now has both 
the defensive acumen and the 
stamina to average 27 minutes 
a night, including a career-
high 35 minutes on Sunday. His 
ability to switch onto guards on 
the perimeter has allowed him 
to anchor Michigan’s defense 
both inside and outside.
“Jon Teske’s come a long 
way,” said Purdue coach Matt 
Painter after his team lost, 
76-57, to the Wolverines on Dec. 
1. “He’s bypassed a lot of people, 
in my opinion, that he competes 
against. ... I don’t know him 
personally, but there’s no way 
he hasn’t worked hard, because 
he was a long way away two 
years ago.”
Added Northwestern coach 
Chris Collins after his team’s 
62-60 loss to Michigan on Dec. 
4: “The development he’s made 
this year has really added to 
(Michigan’s) weaponry, so to 
speak. They don’t have many 
holes.”
Teske 
has 
only 
showed 

flashes of the awaited range. 
But 
as 
with 
Simpson, 
a 
maligned shooter who went 
5-for-10 from deep against the 
Wildcats, what’s been more 
telling is the Wolverines’, and 
Teske’s, unwillingness to go 
away from the three-ball. Teske 
had 
attempted 
22 
threes 
before 
Sunday, 
including seven 
over Michigan’s 
last three games.
“I 
think 
(Teske’s 
confidence) 
never wavered,” 
said 
redshirt 
junior 
wing 
Charles 
Matthews. 
“(He) 
just 
understood that shots were 
going to fall at some point, 
kept taking those shots, kept 
believing in it.”
On Sunday, Teske came out 
firing. Though most of his prior 
3-point attempts were basic 
pick-and-pop looks, against the 
Wildcats, he showed a greater 
willingness to move without 
the ball and hunt his own shots. 
He faded out of the post to pop 
in a 16-footer from the right 
wing on the Wolverines’ fourth 
possession, and hit a long two 
from the left wing one trip 
later, part of a 10-0 start. Later 
in the half, the 3-point barrage 
came in full force.
“I 
know 
I’m 
capable 
of 
knocking down those shots,” 
Teske said. “Just finding the 
right shots within the offense 
… If the shot’s there, I’m going 
to take it. I’m not going to force 
anything.”
It’s too early to tell if 
Sunday’s 
17-point, 
3-of-5 
shooting performance was just 
another flash.
But if it isn’t? That’s a scary 
proposition for the Big Ten, 
as 
Michigan’s 
seven-footer 
continues to grow.

ANNIE KLUS/Daily
Junior center Jon Teske had only hit five 3-pointers in his career before Sunday, when he went 3-of-5 from beyond the arc in an 80-60 win over Northwestern.

“It’s hard 
to score 
goals in that 
tournament.”

“(Jon Teske) 
was a long way 
away two years 
ago.” 

“Probably one 
of the biggest 
goals I’ve ever 
scored.”

“(That’s) big to 
get those big 
men that can 
shoot.”

A second-generation 
reflection on the model 
minority

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL


P

acifist is a title I started giving myself after 
the fateful day I spent with Yoko Ono’s trea-
sure trove of experimental, anti-war art at the 
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain on my first trip 
abroad. Fifteen years old and wide-eyed, my first plane 
trip landed me in the heart of jet-lagged sentimentality 
and an art exhibit calling for non-violence. I can point to 
that day and know who I became on it, and like anyone, 
could point to a great number of other days relevant to 
creating the self, with impacts sometimes felt immedi-
ately and other times only much later.
I took Ono for God at the time (her status remains), 
and in feeling that 
I had stumbled 

upon the secrets of the world, I turned ideology into 
action, moving from pacifist to peacemaker. Ono’s strat-
egies were simple: Take the things you do and see each 
day, and make peace with them. Her famous Hair Peace 
became a symbol of the anti-war generation, as she and 
many others refused to cut their hair as an act of defy-
ing the violence that would otherwise be shown with 
scissors and blades. Bed Peace was another favorite, a 
10-day event during which she and John Lennon invited 
the press to broadcast their gentility as they led a “bed-
in” advocating for nonviolence. Living this way, with a 
conscious extension of effort toward object-awareness 
and making peace becomes cumulative, habitual.
Perhaps my own peacemaking has become 
cumulative, habitual. Since that fateful 
spring day, I have all but tattooed Ono’s 
books into my mind, have become a pupil 
of the nation’s leading peace scholars, 
invested my time in human rights proj-
ects, studied disarmament around 
the globe, written plays to nudge the 
world toward change, and found 
myself speaking in public fora 
on issues of citizenship, non-
violence and our chances for 
perpetual peace.
And yet as the new year 
brought 
forth 
the 
long-
awaited shared experience 
of watching the clock, I found 
myself ruminating on the areas 
of my life with which I had not made 
peace. The construction of peace, be it 
at micro or macro scales, seems to me 
to require only intention and ada-
mancy. Neglected in my previous 
pursuits — and at the forefront of 
my mind, as the fireworks greet-
ed the new calendar year — was 
making peace with the very thing 
we stood around to watch: the 
passing of time itself.
We are headfirst in the win-
ter semester of university, facing 
a multitude of goodbyes: to old 
courses and their expired syllabi, to 
old selves by way of resolutions for 
betterment in 2019, to friends who 
will soon graduate and move away. 
This liminality and tumult is a source 
of real anxiety for me and many others. I 
have been known to greet the uncertainties 
of the future with stasis and a fear of commit-
ment to that which is fleeting. For many peo-
ple I know, the heartache that time brings 
— by taking people we love and the people 
we think we are — is an unbearable one.
And yet, watching time pass in that sus-
pended state after midnight on New Year’s 

incited reflection on the momentousness of 2018. To take 
stock of a year in the life of the self is to recall its full-
ness: in joys and disappointments, solitudes and compa-
ny. For me, 2018 was a year of incomparable growth and 
mobility. I spent a fourth of it living in Iceland and solo-
traveling throughout Scandinavia, during which I felt 
constantly aware of time’s strange behavior. I wandered 
in an extended period of heightened sensitivity, loving a 
place and its landscapes, art and people wholeheartedly, 
fully. Every seaside mountain and cat roaming the street 
and stroll through a garden invoked in me tremendous 
love.
My heart was a thousand unsent thank-you cards and 
a thousand unsent love letters every moment of every 
day.
Local friends and I drove through countryside, 
lounged in cafes, and hiked postcard-style lands, and 
each moment, I knew, was the last of its kind. For three 
months, I was in a constant state of loving — deeply — 
and leaving. The solo travel was just as liminal. The 
cityscapes and hostel friends filled me and my days with 
a cinematic wholeness — the discovery and subsequent 
tenderness toward the details of the Scandinavian land-
scape was constant.
So, too, was the leaving.
For a long while after I returned to the States, I 
grieved for the too intense loving-and-leaving in which 
my heart had engaged. Time, it seemed, had taken back 
everything it gave.
To make peace with the passage of time means to 
accept the constancy of this fluctuation. That the lim-
inality is the guarantee. That the loving comes with the 
leaving. To me, having to say goodbye to those we care 
for is made easier when we remember the world is small, 
and if we’re lucky, life is long. Making peace with the 
passage of time means granting yourself the opportu-
nity to feel and care fully, no matter the rate of return.
Time-induced iterations of our selves are perhaps our 
greatest gifts. We both shed and acquire faults and fail-
ings, virtues and successes. We are both timeworn and 
always reborn. Perhaps our transience is our only guar-
antee. If that is so, making peace with time means ach-
ing for our old selves only in moderation, knowing that 
new ones are in constant creation.
The 15-year-old could not have dreamed what she 
would become, or what the world around her would 
become, or that she would find herself, at 20, on a Reyk-
javik shoreline looking at the inscriptions on Ono’s Peace 
Tower. Thankfully she had the foresight to let go of the 
pieces of her self that no longer became her, embracing 
transience as a tool for change instead of a penalty. Per-
haps, in the quest for peacemaking, I will do the same. 
My heart has learned how to be simultaneously full of 
goodbye letters and greeting cards. Maybe this making 
of peace with the passage of time is to 2019 what Hair 
Peace was to the ‘70s.
May we all strive to make a little more peace in these 
lives, transient as they are.

round a corner you might oth-
erwise stroll past on Main 
Street, there is a set of glass 
doors between ivory white brick that 
holds the smallest, most restless Cuban 
eatery in town. Home to coconut cream 
milkshakes, community tables, and 
burgers stacked with eggs, guacamole 
and fries, Frita Batidos is continuously 
brimming with culinary enthusiasts 
from open ‘til close.
As sacred as Fritas has been to Ann 
Arbor’s savory landscape for the last 
eight years, it is hard to deny its success. 
And in a parallel and perfect universe, 
there would be a Frita Batidos gracing 
at least one canopy sign in every met-
ropolitan city in the U.S — at least the 
Michigan alumni could attest to that.
So, what if there was?
Fritas rakes in $8.50 for each burger 
it so artistically serves, but building out 
several locations is still a slow and pric-
ey feat. Let’s say they decide to build a 
couple dozen locations over the next few 
decades.
In its theoretical expansion, if Fri-
tas funds were to run dry, a way to 
gain access to millions of dollars is by 
going public: letting laymen get a slice 
of the pie (or rather, a bite of the burg-
er). Investors nationwide can purchase 
a share, or a stock, of Fritas and own a 
fraction of what once was just the little 
restaurant down Washington Street. So, 
needing access to thousands of investors 
to be able to expand more rapidly, Fritas 
takes the leap and files to go public.
After a regulatory green light is sig-
naled by Wall Street and the federal 
government, bankers and attorneys 
tend to the grunt work. They analyze 
when to release shares to the public, 
how much each share will be, and iron 
out the details. And then, on the little 
ticker that scrolls robotically across 
your screen each weekday, FRTA▲14.2% 
joins the pack.
This “pack” is otherwise known as 
an index. Like the Dow Jones (DJIA) or 
S&P 500, an index is made up of tens, 
hundreds or even thousands of com-
panies that fit certain criteria that can 
speak to their holistic performance. For 
example, the S&P 500 is a listing of the 
500 largest companies in the U.S. While 
Frita Batidos could eventually size up 
to eatery behemoths McDonald’s and 
Chipotle, it may find itself listed in 
the Russell 2000 Index: a compilation 
of 2,000 small public companies that 
benchmarks small market cap stocks in 
the U.S.
Now, as an investor with the ability 
to purchase shares of Fritas, you want 
to make sure you’re getting the best 
bang for your buck. Essentially, the 

mindset to adopt when facing invest-
ment decisions is to purchase at a low 
price in hopes that it will rise over the 
course you own the share, so you can 
eventually sell it in the market at a 
higher price, and pocket the difference.
Think of this like a bet. When you 
buy a share in a company, you tempt 
fortune on either the company or mac-
roeconomic conditions to go well for 
the time period you plan on holding 
that investment.
Your Fritas investment in action: If 
you buy a share of Fritas at $20 and its 
fate turns south, you lose $2 if it sinks 
to $18.
Don’t bite? If you buy 20 shares of 
Fritas and things go well — say the 
share price increases to $25 — you earn 
$100 without lifting a finger.
This price can go up and down for a 
myriad of reasons, but fundamentally, 
it rests on the company’s performance 
and the market’s appetite for Fri-
tas’ stock. The more that people want 
to sink their teeth into a soft egg bun 
enveloping spicy chorizo, the higher 

Fritas revenue will be. And the higher 
the revenue, the better off the compa-
ny’s sustenance. As long as Fritas con-
tinues to perform as well as it does on 
a Friday night here in Ann Arbor, the 
more investors it will attract.
If you decide to take on the investor 
role, once you purchase shares in your 
first company, you have opened the 
cork to bottomless opportunity. You 
can pair passion and prognosis to delve 
into companies whose growth piques 
your interest. And as you accumulate 
investments in more companies, you 
inaugurate the beginnings of a portfo-
lio.
As you begin to piece your portfolio 
together, it is important to keep diver-
sity at the forefront of your decision-
making. While it pains me to report that 
just 12-15 percent of Wall Street traders 
are women, I’m referring to another 
kind of diversity: portfolio diversifica-
tion. For example, if every Main Street 
facility was to go public and be listed 
on the New York Stock Exchange, it is 
unwise to pour your money into Fritas, 

bd’s Mongolian Grill and Prickly Pear. 
Rather, some of your money should be 
allocated to other industries, such as 
retail, like Warby Parker or Shinola, or 
service industries, like Anneke’s Down-
town Hair & Company. So if restaurants 
have a bad week, there’s a good chance 
some of your other investments had a 
better week.
Beyond the inner workings of the 
companies you select, there are great-
er forces applied to every company on 
the volatile stock market. While your 
companies may perform well on their 
own, the stock market is collectively 
subject to good and bad news about our 
towering economy. So, when purchas-
ing shares, it is important to assess the 
health of our overall economic auster-
ity, as its performance will often trump 
that of your FRTA holding and other 
individual companies, and could be the 
determinant of how much you lose or 
pocket in your portfolio.
And this, friends, is the stock market 
as told by your favorite Cuban burger 
place. Need a soda?

A second-
generation 
reflection on 
the model 
minority

Annie Klus /Daily 
See SECOND GENERATION, Page 6B

I

n accordance with the Pew 
Research Center this article refers 
to second-generation as US-born 
children of immigrants.
It’s a Saturday morning, and the 
earthy, slightly acrid aroma perks me up 
as I walk into Philz Coffee in the Mis-
sion District of San Francisco with Chris 
Shih, a good friend and former classmate 
of mine who, despite having finished 
most of a pre-medical program, ultimate-
ly transferred and obtained a degree in 
electrical engineering. He now works as 
a software engineer, using almost none of 
what he studied in school.
We’re sitting a few minutes later, cof-
fees in hand, and he leans in with a smile.
“You’re really out here, huh? Living 
large,” he says to me, in reference to my 
cross-country visit to the area for a job 
interview.
“Yeah,” I respond with a chuckle. “I 
feel very lucky to be here.”
I haven’t seen him in quite a while. We 

were neighbors in college, but he was a 
bit older, graduating when I was a sopho-
more before dropping out of his master’s 
program to enter the workforce.
Chris and I are, at least demographi-
cally, quite similar. He’s a second-gen-
eration Taiwanese American, and I’m a 
second-generation Chinese American. 
We were both born to educated immi-
grant parents, attended university where 
we studied engineering and are early in 
our careers in the tech industry. Barring 
different Romanization, even our last 
names are the same.
This is a common archetype for young 
Asian Americans, describing not only the 
two of us, but many of our friends and 
hundreds of thousands of students and 
recent graduates around the country. It’s 
accurate even down to the experience of 
entering college on a pre-medical track — 
I too wanted to be a doctor, but dropped 
pre-med to become a software engineer. 
I laugh every time I tell people this, 

because it’s such a “typical Asian thing” 
to have done. Though, to be honest, I’m 
unsure of why I find it funny.
Chris and I have talked about this 
before, and it’s something I’ve thought 
about a lot. I have at least a dozen sec-
ond-gen Asian-American friends and 
classmates who have the exact same 
story. This can’t be purely coincidental, 
given the usual image evoked in the pub-
lic consciousness when we say “Asian”: 
someone, usually of East Asian descent, 
educated and economically stable, with 
a propensity for STEM fields, law-abid-
ing, reserved, unlikely to be politically 
involved or outspoken and perhaps a bit 
awkward.
This 
characterization 
is 
usually 
known as the “model minority stereo-
type,” a phrase coined by William Peter-
son’s essay titled Success Story, Japanese 
American Style published in the Jan. 
9, 1966 edition of The New York Times 
Magazine. The essay describes the rela-
tive success of Japanese Americans 
despite marginalization, citing strong 
work ethics and family val-
ues as factors that prevented 
the Japanese from becom-
ing a “problem minority.”
Statistically, Asian stu-
dents are significantly more 
likely to be in STEM than 
other fields of study. One of 
the prevailing hypotheses as 
to why so many Asian 
students 
choose 
to 
pursue medicine, law 
or engineering is the 
pressure that came 
from our parents and 
the Asian cultural val-
ues 
emphasizing 
education and hard 
work.
The topic comes 
up in my conver-
sation with Chris, 
and I take a poke 
at it.
“Well, 
Asian 
kids 
have 
four 
career 
options: doc-
tor, 
lawyer, 
engineer or 
failure,” 
I 
crack, 
knowing 
Chris will 
laugh.
He does, 
and 
his 
eyes 
have 
an inquisi-
tive 
look 
in them as 

he processes the joke. I’m unsure if it’s 
because he agrees, or because he pos-
sesses the same type of cultural under-
standing that makes it funny for me to 
have dropped biochemistry for computer 
science.
Then he responds, “Well, it’s kind of 
true, right?”
W

hy does it appear that so 
many Asian students go 
into STEM fields? What are 
the implications of our conforming to the 
so-called model minority stereotype? 
I started reaching out to friends and 
acquaintances with similar backgrounds 
— mostly second-gen Chinese, Taiwan-
ese, Korean and Indian Americans — to 
see how they felt about the stereotype 
and its impacts on the second-gen expe-
rience.
“I 
picked 
electrical 
engineering 
because an engineering degree was 
practical and just seemed like my best 
choice,” Justin Jung, a Korean-American 
senior at Michigan Technological Uni-
versity told me. He was wearing a dress 
shirt and slacks and loosening a necktie 
as he spoke, having just come from a job 
interview in town. He didn’t elaborate 
much on what constitutes a “best choice.”
“Maybe that was passed along to me 
by my parents, I don’t know,” Jung said. 
“They didn’t have any direct influence 
over my decision. They told me, ‘Do 
whatever you want,’ but they did suggest 
engineering, and that was my choice.”
Out of more than two dozen second-
generation Asian-American students I 
spoke to, enrolled in a variety of majors, 
almost none told me their parents 
pushed them very explicitly into STEM 
degrees. It just so happens that most of 
them ended up there anyway. It seems 
the tiger moms, caricatures of extremely 
strict Asian mothers (and parents in gen-
eral) popularized by Amy Chua’s contro-
versial 2011 memoir “Battle Hymn of the 
Tiger Mother,” are rarer than I thought. 
I always felt it was a stereotype that 
Asians have incredibly strict parents, but 
that wasn’t the case for me and evidently 
wasn’t for most of my friends, either.
“It’s more subtle than your parents 
saying, ‘You should do STEM’,” Raghu 
Arghal said with a thoughtful tone one 
day over the phone. Raghu is one of my 
closest friends from home, the child of 
two educated Indian immigrants, who 
studies electrical engineering with a 
focus in digital signal processing.
“We subconsciously develop these 
notions partially ingrained in us that his-
tory or the arts are not as useful as some-
thing like engineering,” Raghu said. “As 
a kid at some point, I remember thinking, 
‘Why would I study art?’ The implicit 
value system around education for most 
Asian immigrant parents boils down to 

more education is better than less edu-
cation, and technical education is better 
than non-technical education.”
The consensus among my peers was 
most Asian immigrant parents, rath-
er than explicitly demanding it, more 
actively encourage their kids to get As, or 
to want to become a doctor or to do math 
workbooks in the summer (like I used to) 
instead of encouraging them to practice 
arts or play sports.
For some of us, it works out. As my 
understanding has grown over the years, 
I’ve come to genuinely love working with 
computers and software, even though 
my decision to study computer science 
wasn’t much more of a thought than “the 
intro class was kind of fun and I know 
there’s a job market.” And I’d be lying if 
I said I didn’t get pleasure from know-
ing my parents must be, by stereotypical 
Asian parenting standards, proud of me.
Generally, immigrant Asian parents 
aren’t very verbal with their affection 
but they have no difficulty letting out an 
offhanded “Ling a-yi’s son got into Har-
vard,” or a more pointed, “You should get 
As.”
Though it’s expressed in a language 
that’s sometimes hard for us to under-
stand, we are loved. We know it because 
know our parents struggled in ways we 
do not know how to imagine, and in 
return, we try — sometimes under tre-
mendous pressure — to succeed.
But sometimes, the sacrifices I made to 
compete as an engineering student ren-
dered my personality one-dimensional. I 
pushed my other interests aside for years 
and I have more than once been the per-
son talking about class and work at par-
ties, eliciting eye rolls and dirty looks 
from those nearby. I’ve listened to my 
friends in similar positions divulge their 
frustrations with studying “safe” sub-
jects they weren’t passionate about, and 
wondered if my passions for writing and 
music might have taken off if I was brave 
enough to take the leap.
I

t’s safe to say our childhood 
experiences and our parents’ 
philosophies are phenomena of 
broader social trends. At least in the body 
of second-generation Asian students I’m 
acquainted with, usually one or both 
parents are highly educated and hold a 
professional occupation. That’s because 
most of us are here with direct ties to 
the passage of the 1965 Hart-Celler Act, 
which allotted 170,000 immigration 
visas annually, with per-country quotas 
and preferential categories for skilled 
laborers and those with family in Amer-
ica.
With Hart-Celler, immigration in 
America changed. Before 1965, more 
than two thirds of immigrants to Amer-
ica came from Europe or Canada. How-

ever, between 1971 and 1991, for the first 
time in history, Europeans did not con-
stitute the largest group of immigrants. 
During that period, in which immigra-
tion constituted about 40 percent of the 
population growth in the U.S., more than 
one in three immigrants was from Asia. 
The demographic landscape of America 
was changing rapidly.
For this wave of first-generation Amer-
icans, education and professional skills 
were the way to a better life, the realiza-
tion of their American dream. The story 
of the American immigrant is rife with 
challenges, sacrifice and, out of necessity 
if nothing else, faith in hard work. This is 
a big part of why Asian parents want the 
best for their kids, to the point of some-
times being incredibly harsh about it.
“We know our parents came here with 
next to nothing, and gave up everything 
for us to have a prosperous life,” Toraki 
Maehata, a second-generation Japanese-
American student at Michigan State 
University, told me. “I don’t really think 
I met my parents’ expectations, or fit 
that ‘smart as hell’ Asian stereotype. But 
those sacrifices still motivate me to suc-
ceed.”
As one of the major cultural influ-
ences of today’s second-generation Asian 
Americans, the Asian immigration boom 
was a natural catalyst for the develop-
ment of the generalized notion of Asian-
American identity that exists today. In 
many ways, Asian immigration became 
an extension of the already developing 
model minority stereotype in America.
The notion of the model minority 
reflects a partial truth, in that certain 
subgroups of Asians in America have 
achieved high degrees of socioeconomic 
success, but as a generalization, it boasts 
negative social implications. The per-
ceived socioeconomic success of Asians 
is based on income, education, low crimi-
nality and stable family structures.
Yet, today, about one-third of Bhuta-
nese Americans live below the poverty 
line and approximately one-fourth of 
Hmong Americans over the age of 25 do 
not have a high school diploma. No other 
group of Americans has a larger income 
disparity than Asian Americans, with the 
top tenth percentile of Asians in America 
earning a startling 10.7 times the income 
of the bottom tenth percentile.
The reality is Asian identity in Ameri-
ca is a nebulous thing, with Asian Ameri-
cans and immigrants from many cultures 
contributing vastly different experiences 
at vastly varying levels of representa-
tion. While there are some overarch-
ing experiences and challenges faced by 
overlapping subsets of Asian Americans, 
it’s difficult to point to any singular arti-
fact that is common to all Asians in this 
country.

T

he piano 
in 
my 
childhood 
home is tired. Her brown, 
fraying ivory sags with over-
use and dulled keys sing softly — 
worn out from years of pounding fingers. 
Her exterior — covered in stickers and 
stamps and carved into with uncut fin-
gernails — reeks of resignation. Old and 
abused, the bench squeaks with arthritic 
dejection when slid out into sunlight.
I have always been an extremely pas-
sionate person. The piano in my child-
hood 
home 
represents 
exactly 
the 
effects of this: After over a decade of 
fully-dedicated, emotional excess, the 
keys into which I poured my soul have 
started to give out. I used to get scolded 
by my mom, who would online shop on 
the computer near the music room, “He 

” which translates to, “Don’t throw your-
self onto the piano like a crazy person.” 
But throw myself I would, because I 
knew no other way. If I was going to do 
something, I would assert to her, why not 
do it with the utmost energy, emotion 
and excitement?
I lived my life like this for a while: in a 
hurricane of passion. I played my scales 
in the dynamic fortissimo. I tried to 
befriend every person I’d meet at a party. 
I banged out arpeggios to the frustration 
of my family. I would literally throw up 
after reading a book that moved me. I 
tried to memorize multiple sonatas at a 
time. I lay motionless on my bed as my 
heart strained over the latest boy I had 
decided to crush on.
While this approach to life, in which 
I felt everything amplified by 100, made 
everything more interesting, it was not 
sustainable. I soon came to realize this 
on the soccer field, another place where, 

like 
music, I 
found a home. 
Soccer was a passion, 
one that I never neglected: If we had a 
game, I would give it my all, even from 
the bench. If I was watching a game on 
TV with my dad, I’d exclaim loud com-
mentary at the screen. To me, soccer was 
an outlet, an intersection between cre-
ativity, energy and community. I could 
play as hard as I wanted to, and my ado-
lescent body would come out only with 
a couple of bruises and sore muscles. I 
could laugh and tease with my team-
mates, and sure, we’d have to run laps for 
it, but I’d leave practice with a feeling of 
warmth in my chest. Like piano, this exu-
berance reflected in my everyday life, and 
the world appeared vividly colorful to me 
because of it.
But rainbows are fleeting. With matu-
rity and experience, my naive lens of joy 
began to give way to the darker clouds of 
cynicism. High school proved demand-
ing; I had to quit playing music. Our fam-
ily’s piano remained sad and dulled in the 
dim light of Michigan winters, untouched 
for months. High school soccer proved 
political, and no longer did I enjoy the 
feeling of sisterhood that I had indulged 
in for years. Rather, girls were nasty and 
mean, making fun of the “weirdness” I 
believed to be my shining characteristic.
As I grappled with my sense of self, 
losing footing in music, my life changed 
once again – this time, through soccer. 
At 6:00 a.m. on a winter morning in 
December, as the newly appointed cap-
tain of my varsity soccer team, I tried 
to rally 12 yawning girls into a dedi-
cated and dynamic pre-season soccer 

game. What ensued, as I tried to exhibit 
enthusiasm with all my might, was that 
I finally crashed from the high I’d been 
riding for years.
On a simple corner kick play, I planted 
my leg to cut and felt a thudding pop – I 
had torn almost every ligament in my 
knee. In this moment, my body gave up 
against the overpowering force. Symboli-
cally, it represented the imbalance in my 
approach to life: I was putting too much 
weight on a single ligament that couldn’t 
keep up. As I was wheeled off of the 
field, my teammates looked at me, dumb-
founded. Later, they would tell me they 
thought nothing would be wrong — that 
I’d return to practice the next day entire-
ly the same.
The truth is, after that event, I never 
did return to a soccer field in the same 
way. The months following my injury 
were humiliating, disillusioning and 
frustrating. I lay in bed for weeks pop-
ping Tylenols and ignoring the rash of 
purple-blue bruises that covered my 
swollen leg. I relied on my mom, whose 
love brought her to sleep downstairs 
with me on an uncomfortable couch for 
more than a month, to carry out activi-
ties as simple as going pee. I crutched 
around school out of breath and sweaty, 
trying to keep up with classroom ban-
ter but rather becoming the object of 
tease when I walked in with my full-
leg brace. I felt beaten down, not just 
by those around me, but internally, too. 
I felt fully disconnected from my body. 
I didn’t recognize my frail and feeble 
legs. I yearned to jump up and down and 
dance and run.
I was ashamed that I couldn’t even take 
a shower on my own. To me, to be devoid 
of physical mobility meant to be devoid of 
my youth. I no longer felt strong, energet-
ic and full of life. I felt like the rejected 

piano in my family home: weak, tired and 
resentful.
As I attended physical therapy three 
times a week, I slowly began to regain 
my physical strength. Along with it, I 
tried desperately to rebuild my identity, 
too. I was no longer the carefree, blindly 
headstrong girl I was before I quit piano 
and had my injury. I was more cautious, 
mistrusting and resigned. But I appreci-
ated this newfound maturity, and as a 
result, I listened, observed and reflected 
more. I learned to conserve my energy 
and save pockets of it for the important 
things, like family, true friends and art. 
I revisited music, playing piano to divert 
my thoughts from the soccer games I was 
missing. Soon, I rediscovered my love for 
it. 
These self-discoveries, these adjust-
ments to who I am, are still a work in 
progress. I continue to struggle to find 
outlets for my energy and to live out the 
everyday stressors of college life with 
positivity. I never want to lose my spirit 
— it is the essence of who I am — but in 
such a time of uncertainty and growth, it 
is easy to get lost in pessimistic thought. 
And isn’t that what we’re all doing here 
in college? Desperately grasping onto 
the innocent self that we know, love and 
admire while receiving blows of reality 
that knock us down?
Eventually, I returned to the soccer 
field, albeit a less frenzied player. I still 
play with the utmost passion, but I know 
how to control my previous recklessness. 
And though I had to give up that part of 
me, I now play more consciously, safely 
and therefore, effectively. Similarly, I 
have returned to the music bench. There, 
I play piano: when I want to, how I want 
to and with whomever I want to. The dif-
ference is, I’ve now realized there are 
more dynamics than just forte.

Generalized notions of “Asian suc-
cesses” and “Asian struggles” don’t 
take this into account. Imagining all 
Asians in America as one group essen-
tially projects a singular pan-ethnic 
identity onto them, and the percep-
tion of this identity has been shaped 
by the portrayal of only a few ethnic 
groups. While this monolithic identity 
has provided a vocabulary for conver-
sations around race in America, it has 
also caused entire communities to 
be unrepresented in the mainstream 
Asian-American narrative.
With the development of the model 
minority stereotype, we see a story of 
one of the fastest turnarounds of racial 
perception in American history. The 
first major wave of Asian immigration 
to the mainland United States was in 
the late 1840s, when migrants fleeing 
harsh economic conditions in southern 
China entered through San Francisco 
to find work in railroad construction, 
mining and agriculture. They faced 
extreme racial discrimination, being 
cast pejoratively as “coolies” and con-
tibuting to the subjugating “Yellow 
Peril” in the American zeitgeist. After 
being segregated into enclaves like San 
Francisco’s Chinatown, in 1882, the 
passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act 
barred any further immigration from 
China. The passage of the Immigra-
tion Act of 1924 included the Asian 
Exclusion Act, and severely limiting all 
non-white immigration to the United 
States.
Less than 20 years after the passage 
of the Asian Exclusion Act, the modern 
model minority stereotype began with 
pro-Chinese propaganda in the 1940s, 
a diplomatic gesture toward China, 
who was America’s wartime ally in the 
Pacific theater. The contemporaneous 
internment of Japanese Americans 

seems to indicate this was a matter of 
national convenience and not of racial 
equity.
When the war ended, Chinese and 
Japanese Americans cited their mili-
tary service as appeals for acceptance 
as Americans, and Chinese community 
leaders in the ’50s touted Confucian 
values to frame their communities, 
especially their children, as law-abid-
ing, hard working and studious. The 
appeals around Confucian values in 
particular intended to lessen the vitriol 
of racism at a time when juvenile delin-
quency was one of the major concerns 
of the American public.
The 
Hart-Celler-era 
immigrants 
worked hard to be seen as construc-
tive members of society. Jeff Guo, 
a journalist focused on economics 
and Asian-American affairs, wrote 
in the Washington Post, “The model 
minority myth as we see it today was 
mainly an unintended outcome of ear-
lier attempts by Asian Americans to 
be accepted and recognized as human 
beings. They wanted to be seen as 
American people who were worthy of 
respect and dignity.”
F

or us who do fit the stereo-
type, the up-and-coming gen-
eration of the model minority, 
there are consequences to the cultural 
balance we find for ourselves. If we 
have children who look like us but 
whom we cannot teach the language, 
the food and the culture — children 
who may have little to point to but their 
appearance in claiming Asian identity 
— how do our identities, the culture 
we’re building today, affect what it will 
mean for them to be Asian-American in 
the future?
We who cheered fervently for the 
representation “Crazy Rich Asians” 
brought us — a depiction of wealthy 

East Asians, attractive by Western 
standards and portraying all ethni-
cally Chinese characters — might 
want to ask some questions. How does 
our growing “Asian” spotlight affect 
the undereducated, poor and largely 
unseen war refugee? What does it 
mean for Asians as an umbrella group 
when Harvard is being sued for alleged 
anti-Asian discrimination, apparently 
having too many qualified Asian appli-
cants to let them in fairly, when the 
median Hmong American doesn’t have 
a high school diploma?
People like me bear discrimina-
tion, assuredly. The elementary school 
lunchbox moments (“You eat that? 
Gross”). The surprised remarks of 
“Your English is so good!” and the 
almost innocuous “Where are you 
from?” Being picked for group proj-
ects presumably for our math skills 
and then being excluded socially. The 
reminders of the shape of your eyes and 
your funny name. Discrimination in 
admissions to elite schools, in getting 
promotions at work and in participat-
ing in the housing market are com-
monly cited grievances and legitimate 
concerns.
But these are marked improvements 
over the days of the Chinese and Asian 
Exclusion Acts, the brutal treatment 
of Asian railroad workers, the zoning 
policies and segregations into Chi-
natowns, the internment of Japanese 
Americans, the Los Angeles race riots 
and hate crimes like the senseless mur-
der of Vincent Chin. When I asked my 
Asian friends, ones who, like me, blunt-
ly fit the model minority stereotype, 
about the challenges faced by Asian 
Americans, many said we were faced 
with stereotypes and discrimination in 
general, but few could point to specific 
institutional or structural problems.

For the Asian Americans who get 
the prized stable jobs and the comfort 
that our immigrant parents worked so 
hard for us to have, what comes next? 
It’s socially myopic to stop asking ques-
tions about Asian identity and com-
munity once our own needs are met. 
When you look at the history behind 
the 
experiences, 
stereotypes 
and 
behaviors that have shaped our iden-
tity today, it is clear that our experi-
ences, stereotypes and behaviors today 
will shape what it means to be Asian 
American tomorrow. And that being 
the case, I’d argue the most important 
stereotype we have yet to break is that 
Asians are socially unconcerned and 
uninvolved. If we want Asians to be 
taken seriously and seen as a diverse 
group of people with culture beyond 
making grades and pulling paychecks, 
we need to start speaking up, making 
ourselves visible and pointing out that 
the story isn’t so simple.
I don’t think it’s naive to believe 
social change begins at the individual 
and the community level, but it’s going 
to take time and serious effort, not only 
on the part of Asian Americans, to build 
a new Asian-American identity — one 
that’s perceived as nuanced, genuinely 
American and unabashedly self-aware 
and conscious of gaps in status and rep-
resentation in our home country.
The stakes are ultimately higher 
than understanding why so many sec-
ond-generation Asian Americans live 
up to the model minority stereotype. 
They involve understanding the social 
factors that make it so others don’t 
have the opportunity to be “model” and 
indeed reduce entire races to “problem 
minorities.” And if those are the stakes 
at play, let’s be conscious of them, and 
be, in a new way, what we supposedly 
are: models.

“If we have children who look like us but whom we cannot 

teach the language, the food and the culture — children who 

may have little to point to but their appearance in claiming 

Asian identity — how do our identities, the culture we’re 

building today, affect what it will mean for them to be Asian 

American in the future?”
