Barrawillbe the third
woman to deliver

By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
Withjust afew months behind
the wheel of one of the world's
largest automakers, Mary Barra,
the CEO of General Motors
Company, has been selected to
deliver the University's spring
commencement address at Mich-
igan Stadium.
The University has announced
plansto award Barra an honorary
Doctor of Engineering when she
speaks at commencement exer-
cises May 3, pending approval by
the University's Board of Regents
at their meeting later this month.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said Barra's story
exemplifies a business leader
who learned every aspect of

her industry and earned her
advancements as she worked her
way through the ranks of Gen-
eral Motors.
"She represents so many, dif-
ferent things - somebody who
worked her way through the
company, someone who is in
Detroit helping to revive the
whole Michigan economy, a real
breakthrough for women's lead-
ership," Coleman said in an inter-
view with the Daily.
Born in Waterford, Barragrad-
uated from the General Motors
Institute - since renamed Ket-
teringUniversity - in1985 with a
degree in electrical engineering.
She earned an MBA from Stan-
ford University in 1990.
Barra, who has dedicated her
entire career to General Motors,
has held a variety of positions.
She was a plant manager at
Detroit Hamtramck Assembly,
vice president of global manu-
facturing engineering from 2008
to 2009, vice president of global
human resources from 2009 to

SAN DIEGO - While many
University students traveled to
the Golden Coast to laze in the

sun over Spring Break, Universi-
ty President Mary Sue Coleman
traveled to California for a dif-
ferent reason: to receive a Life-
time Achievement Award.
Presented by the Ameri-
can Counsel on Education, the
award recognized Coleman's
work in higher education as a
professor, administrator and
university president.
Before ACE President Molly

Corbett Broad presented her
with the award, Coleman gave
the distinguished Robert H.
Atwell Lecture before more
than 500 higher education offi-
cials at the organization's 96th
annual meeting at the Manches-
ter Grand Hyatt hotel in San
Diego.
In her speech titled "Inno-
vate, Disrupt, Repeat," Coleman
focused primarily on the impor-

tance of entrepreneurship and
innovation in higher education.
Calling Michigan the "first Sili-
con Valley," Coleman spoke of
the state's entrepreneurial drive
in the automobile industry in
the early 20th century. She said
entrepreneurship gives students
the opportunity to navigate the
ever-changing, unpredictable
job market today.

CAMPUS LIFE
NASA icon
gives keynote
on education

First woman of color
in space said diverse
workforce will
improve innovation
By TANAZ AHMED and
MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporters
For some, space may not be the
final frontier.
Mae Jemison, former NASA
astronaut, gave the keynote lec-
ture for the 32nd annual Women
of Color Task Force Career Con-
ference at Hill Auditorium on
Friday. Jemison, a physician and
former Peace Corps participant,
became the first woman of color
to travel to space when she joined
the crew of the space shuttle
Endeavour in 1992.
Marlanna Landeros, a member
of the WCTF executive team, said
the event was the largest profes-
sional development conference
hosted at the University. Open to
all University staff and students
as well as to the general public,
it was designed to promote the
career and personal development

of women of color working at the
University.
Jemison, a visiting professor
at the University, left NASA a
year after her space mission. She
went on to found her own tech-
nology consulting company, The
Jemison Group, Inc., teach at
Dartmouth College and become
a professor-at-large at Cornell
University.
During her speech, Jemison
focused on the importance of
diversity in the science, technol-
ogy, engineering and math fields.
"We're building and defining a
path with less than a third of the
intellectual capacity, the experi-
ence, the ambitions, the visions,
the perspectives given to us,"
Jemison said.
Since scientists and math-
ematicians choose the topics to
be researched, the data sets to
be analyzed and the standards
through which scientific obser-
vations are measured, Jemison
said it is necessary to encourage
a diverse workforce in STEM
fields.
Jemison noted examples of
how breast cancer in women and
testicular cancer were treated

its annual report for the 2012 to
2013 academic year Feb. 28, high-
lighting shifts in sexual miscon-

They spend their days shut-

Regent Power abruptly resigns

48 Years Ago This Week
(March 12,1966)
University Regent Eugene B.
Power resigned to the shock of
many on campus.
Prior to Power's resignation,
Michigan Attorney General
Frank Kelley stated Power was in
a situation in which there was a
"substantial conflict of interest."
Before becoming regent, Power
was the founder of University
Microfilms, a company that used
microfilm to reproduce and pre-
serveolder scholarlyworks.
Once he became a regent, con-
tracts between the company and
the University were canceled in
orderto avoid a conflictof interest.
However, in the interim before

Power assumed office, the Uni-
versity continued to conduct busi-
ness with the company, making
Power's position as regent contro-
versial.
40 Years Ago This Week
(March 13,1974)
Approximately 70 streakers
and nearly 10,000 spectators
filled the Diag on March 13, 1974
for mass "streak-ins."
There were two mass
"streak-ins" along with the
occasional individual streakers
throughout the day. Organizers
called the event "Annual U-M
Lucky Streak." The days leading
up to the "Annual U-M Lucky
Streak" also saw a few individual

streakers in the Diag as well.
33 Years Ago This Week
(March10, 1981)
A fight in Bursley Residence
Hall led to a gunshot being fired
and the arrest of student Billy
Jackson.
The fight occurred in the
second-floor bathroom of the
residence hall. After the fight
was broken up, the two students
involved were taken downstairs
to speak to Housing Security. The
men continued to scuffle while
downstairs, and after nearing an
exit; Jackson fired a shot with his
handgun and then ran to his car.

Sec. of Education pushes
for more higher ed. funds

Obama's proposed
2015 budget would
increase student aid
grants and loans
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
DailyStaffReporter
In his 2014 State of the Union
Address, President Barack
Obama told the nation that edu-
cation reform would be critical
to achieving economic stability.
Following the release of Obama's
2015 fiscal year budget proposal
Tuesday, Arne Duncan, U.S.
Secretary of Education, ham-
mered the point home.
The education portion of the
president's proposed budget
allots $69 billion in discretion-
ary funding to the Department
of Education, marking a 2-per-
cent increase from the 2014

budget. Three fourths of this
appropriation would go toward
financial aid for college stu-
dents, special education and
high-poverty schools, according
to the Department of Education
website.
The remaining funds would
be invested in the expansion of
high quality preschooling, the
establishment of a new college
ranking system and an effort to
increase college affordability.
In a conference call with
members of the media, Duncan
explained that all of these con-
cepts are ultimately linked.
"By investing in high quality
early childhood education, we
are able to close achievement
gaps, provide life transforming
opportunities for children and
strengthen and build a thriving
middle class," he said.
Closing the achievement
gap, he said, could ultimately
improve students' ability to get

H-,OKU

into college. However, college
attendance is also contingent
on its price tag, an issue that the
proposal also seeks to address.
The education budget as out-
lined would expand the gov-
ernment's Pay as You Earn
program, capping student loan
repayment plans at 10 percent of
discretionary income to "keep
your monthly student loan pay-
ments affordable," and to keep
college students from deepen-
ing their debts, according to the
PAYE website.
The bill would also make
the American Opportunity Tax
Credit - which provides up to
$2,500 in refundable tax credits
for tuition - permanent. Sen.
Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.)
cosponsored the legislation
behind the AOTC, which is cur-
rently set to expire in December
2017.
In the last year, affordability
has been a hot topic at the Uni-
versity, present in both adminis-
trative and student affairs.
In a speech to the Lansing
Regional Chamber Economic
Club on Feb. 13, University Pres-
ident Mary Sue Coleman said
higher education is central to
state development. She praised
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
2015 budget proposal, which
would increase public higher
education appropriations by 6.1
percent at a time when states,
on average, are spending 28
percent less on college students
than they did in 2008.
"We have a chance here in
Michigan to recapture national
leadership with the growth of
our public universities," Cole-
man said. "I firmly believe that
states that do not invest in high-
er education will not win the
21st century, and I want desper-
ately for Michigan to win."
In a January question-and-
answer with the Daily, Uni-
versity President-elect Mark
Schlissel said affordability
would be a top priority of his
from the beginning of his ten-

Zaineb Abdul-Nabi
helped present
awards to winners
on Oscar Sunday
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
Unlike most University
students, LSA senior Zaineb
Abdul-Nabi did not watch the
Academy Awards on March 2.
Instead, she attended them.
Abdul-Nabi, along with five
other college students from
across the nation, was a win-
ner of this year's Team Oscar
competition, a film contest that
gives students the chance to
appear at the awards ceremo-
ny and be recognized for their
work in creative filmmaking.
The winning filmmakers
are flown to California for the
week leading up to the Acad-
emy Awards. During the cer-
emony, the students are given
the opportunity to stand on
stage and hand the Oscar statu-
ettes to presenters.

"We created this contest
last year to give students who
are passionate about film, the
opportunity to set their sights
on the future," said show pro-
ducers Craig Zadan and Neil
Meron in an interview with
Variety. "We received so many
inspiring submissions this year
... but the talent and stories of
these six winners really rep-
resent what Team Oscar is all
about and convinced us that
they are a perfect fit for the
Oscar stage."
More than a thousand stu-
dents submitted pieces to Team
Oscar. The application for the
competition asked for a one-
minute video describing how
the contestants saw themselves
contributing to the future of
the film industry.
Entrants were also asked
to submit an essay discussing
a movie that inspired them.
Zadan and Meron conducted
interviews with the finalists.
"My video was on how I like
to focus on the everyday, ordi-
nary people's lives and what's
so extraordinary about those
stories," Abdul-Nabi said.

Abdul-Nabi elected to
write her essay on the Pedro
Almod6var-directed film
"Volver," starring Penelope
Cruz.
"That film was kind of monu-
mental in my life," Abdul-Nabi
said. "It got me thinking about
how women have the ability to
not only carry the story, but
drive the feelings of the entire
narrative. I thought that was
pretty remarkable."
During her week in Los
Angeles, Abdul-Nabi was able
to meet Gary Shore, director
of the indie film "The Cup of
Tears." Team Oscar winners
were introduced to the direc-
tors of the animated film "Fro-
zen" and given tours of Disney
Studios and the Academy Film
Archive.
The winners also attended
pre-Oscar events such as the
first-ever Oscar concert, which
featured performances of nom-
inated songs, and the Oscars
animation event hosted by
John C. Reilly.

From Page 1A
2011 and senior vice president
of global product development
from 2011 until her appointment
as CEO. Barra succeeded former
CEO Dan Akerson in January.
Barra will lead Detroit-based
General Motors as the city and its
automakers continue to rebound
from declining sales in the mid-
2000s and subsequent bankrupt-
cies.
Last year, the U.S. Treasury
Department sold its remaining
shares of General Motors com-
mon stock, closing a chapter in
the automaker's history marked
by a national economic crisis that
hit Detroit's auto industry espe-
cially hard. General Motors filed
for bankruptcy in 2009. The com-
pany still faces a historically low
market share, among other chal-
lenges.
In an interview with the Daily,
Barra said her selection as com-
mencement speaker could speak
to the resurgence of General
Motors and the city of Detroit.
"The company has great poten-
tial and is already demonstrating
that," she said. "I'm highly opti-
mistic for Detroit, and I think that
reflects on the whole state and all
the big institutions in the state
like the University of Michigan."
Looking at once-iconic compa-
nies that have now disappeared,
Barra said businesses - and
future business leaders - have
the opportunity to glean impor-
tant lessons.
"It's important lessons on being
focused on the customer, having
great products, being responsible
from all aspects of being a good
corporate citizen - but also the
power of heart: when things get
difficult, you can turn it around,"
she said.
Though Coleman said the
selection was made for a vari-
ety of reasons, she said the city's
resurgence did factor into the
decision.
"The fact that she does repre-
sent in many ways the resurgence
of the auto industry - I'm very
proud about that," Coleman said.
While Barra said she hasn't
written her speech yet, she wants
to ask graduates to think about
the kind of leader they want to be
upon leaving college.
"First of all, you should do what
you love," she said. "But there is
no substitute for hard work. I'm

"It's not just what our students
will gain, but also what our Uni-
versity gains with the similar
mindset focused on innovation,"
Coleman said.
Coleman defined three key
ways to establish a more innova-
tive environment at a university:
establishing policies to support
experimentation, building a
vibrant campus ecosystem and
creating a culture of innovation.
She said the University used
these steps to reach its entre-
preneurial educational goals,
though the potential is still
growing.
The University has expanded
its entrepreneurial efforts in sev-
eral ways during the past few

years. With 34 undergraduate
and 64 graduate courses current-
ly offered in entrepreneurship,
Coleman said students are the
driving force in this change in the
campus climate.
"This generation of students
has a passion for entrepreneur-
ship that almost knows no
bounds," Coleman said.
Coleman touched on sev-

differently. She said it was not
until women were more involved
in the field that alternatives to
mastectomies were considered.
After the event, Jemison dis-
cussed her current project, 100
Year Starship, and her role as its
principal. The Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency- and
NASA-funded project is work-
ing toward making interstellar
travel possible within the next
100 years.
100 Year Starship seeks to
include a variety of individuals
from across all disciplines in its
development.
"The capabilities that are need-
ed for successful human travel
beyond another star, they're the

proud of my parents for what
they accomplished and follow-
ing in my dad's footsteps of being
a part of the auto industry, so I
think there's very strong messag-
es about what you can achieve -
whether it's the American dream
or the global dream."
She also said it's often diffi-
cult to anticipate the entirety of a
career path - and that's okay.
"If you set your sights to it, you
can surprise yourself with what
you accomplish. I don't think
anyone can, as they leave college,
can say I'm going to do this and
that, because life doesn't happen
that way, but being ready for the
wonderful opportunities that are
goingto be put in front of you and
then working hard and seizing
them."
Barra, who in 2014 ranked first
on Fortune magazine's list of the
"50 Most Powerful Women in
Business," is the first woman to
lead a major automaker and is one
of only a few female leaders of a
major industrial corporation.
Since 1998, there have only
been two female spring com-
mencement speakers - former
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm in 2003 and Christiane
Amanpour, chief international
correspondent for CNN, in 2006.
Former NPR radio host Michele
Norris delivered the Winter 2013
commencement address.
However, Coleman, who is the
University's first female presi-
dent, said Barra likely doesn't
define herself as General Motors'
first female CEO.
"I know she probably down-
plays the symbolism of the role,
but I do think it's significant,"
Coleman said.
Still, Barra said she wants to
encourage students - especially
young girls - to not shy away
from math and science.
"I think we don't do a good
enough job of mapping how
important math and science is to
the areas they are interested in,"
she said.
Selection credentials aside,
Barra said she has always been a
Michigan fan and is thrilled about
the opportunity to address the
University's graduates.
"It's just a privilege and an
honor for me to have the oppor-
tunity to speak to the graduating
class at the University of Michi-
gan," Barra said. "I take it very
seriously."
University to award five
eral initiatives around campus,
including the creation of a minor
in entrepreneurship, the estab-
lishment of the Center for Entre-
preneurship and the creation of
the Senior Council to the Provost
for Entrepreneurial Education,
among dozens of other programs
put in place.
"We have reimagined our
future," Coleman said. "Entrepre-
neurship, disruptive innovation,
technology virtualization and
collaboration is making it happen
now."
After Coleman's speech, Cor-
bett Broad presented Coleman
with her award, lauding her work
during her tenure at the Univer-
sity.
"It is clear that she has and will
continue to receive well-deserved
recognition," Broad said. "We all
know that leaving from her post

as president of the University of
Michigan does not mean that she
won't continue her service in the
field of higher education."
"I'm very proud ACE can add
to the crescendo of thanks that
is deservedly given to Mary Sue
Coleman," she added.
Coleman received her under-
graduate degree in chemistry
from Grinnell College and her
very same capabilities that are
required for us to live successfully
here on Earth," Jemison said.
The project would not only
push for the discovery of other
alternative energy sources, but
could also transform the way
materials such as clothing are
produced and lead to a greater
insight into human behavior,
Jemison said.
"I was absolutely amazed
by her commentary - the
integration of what's happen-
ing in space and here is some-
thing I never thought about,"
said Tracey Taylor, a lecture
attendee and employee of
Gaining Early Awareness and
Readiness for Undergraduate
Programs.
Jemison concluded her
lecture by telling women to
begin setting the standards of

additional honorary degrees
Five others will also receive
honorary degrees, pending
approval by the regents.
James L. Curtis, a psychia-
trist and philanthropist, will
receive a Doctor of Science. The
only Black student in his Medi-
cal School class, Curtis graduated
with an M.D. in 1946 before pur-
suing a career in psychiatry that
spanned more than half a centu-
ry. Beside his work asa practicing
clinician, Curtis was an educator
and Medical School administra-
tor. He served as the associate
dean of student affairs at Cornell
Medical School for 10 years and
as a department director at the
Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons for two
decades.
Curtis has also been a longtime
donor to the University, includ-
ing support for the University of
Michigan Museum of Art's James
L. and Vivian A. Curtis Gallery
of African and African American
Art, established in 1998.
Computer scientist Adele
Goldberg, who made important
contributions to the develop-
ment of the personal computer,
will also receive a Doctor of Sci-
ence. Goldberg began her career
as a researcher at Xerox before
contributing to object-oriented
programming language devel-
opment in the 1970s. She is cur-
rently the founder and director of
consulting firm Neometron, Inc.
and is a member of the Women in
Technology International Hall of
Fame.
"She made real breakthroughs
in computer science," Coleman
said. "She was one of the people
who really began the develop-
ment of the personal computer."
Daniel Okrent, a journalist,
editor and cultural historian, will
be recommended to receive a Doc-
tor of Humane Letters. Okrent is
perhaps best known as The New
York Times' first public editor,
responsible for critiquing the
paper's accuracy and objectivity.
In 1980, Okrent created Rotisserie
League Baseball, a precursor to
today's fantasysports. Okrentwas
a features editor at The Michigan
Daily before going on to serve as
an editor at Life magazine and
Time magazine.
Okrent will serve as the key-
note speaker at Rackham's gradu-
ation ceremony on May 2 at Hill
Auditorium.
Marshall Weinberg, a busi-
doctorate in biochemistry from
the University of North Carolina.
Before coming to the University,
Coleman worked at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky for 20 years as
the director of its cancer research
center and later as the president
of the University of Iowa.
During her tenure as the Uni-
versity's 13th president, Coleman
spearheaded a host of initia-
tives aimed at improving student
life, campus infrastructure and
research funding, among other
administrative tasks.
Throughout her presidency,
Coleman faced several legal and
political battles, including Pro-
posal 2, which banned affirmative
action in college admissions deci-
sions - a proposal Coleman pub-
licly opposes.
Coleman led the University's
largest capital campaign - The

Michigan Difference - which
garnered $3.2 billion by the time it
concluded in 2008. The campaign
funded numerous campus renova-
tions and additions, including the
construction of the Ford School of
Public Policy's Weill Hall and the
Ross School of Business.
In November, Coleman
launched the University's next
fundraising campaign, Victors
achievements instead of fol-
lowing the ones already in
place.
"Be bold. Be brave. Push on
things and don't hold your-
self back. Don't limit yourself
because someone else is lim-
ited," Jemison said after the
address. "You have every right
to be here and to change things
around the world. You don't
have to wait for permission."
Before Jemison's address,
University President Mary
Sue Coleman lauded the task
force's success over her tenure
as a University administra-
tor, complimenting the group
on recently co-piloting a new
career development program.
Dubbed "Women's Repro-
ductive Health Research," the
initiative's goal is to "increase
the number and effectiveness of

nessman and philanthropist,
will receive a Doctor of Laws.
Weinberg earned an undergrad-
uate degree in philosophy from
the University in 1950 and spent
his career at Herzfeld & Stern,
a New York investment firm.
A noted philanthropist, Wein-
berg has frequently contribut-
ed to and raised awareness for
a variety of causes, including
Jewish organizations and Uni-
versity units. He has served on
the LSA Dean's Advisory Com-
mittee and the Honors Program
Advisory Committee, in addi-
tion to endowing professor-
ships, fellowships and programs
throughout LSA.
"What I love about Marshall
is that he has been so dedicated
- not only to the University of
Michigan - but to philanthropic
organizations all over," Coleman
said.
Jos6 Antonio Abreu, an
orchestra conductor, educator
and economist, will receive an
honorary Doctor of Music. A pia-
nist renowned across the world,
in 1975 Abreu founded El Sistema,
the National Network of Youth
and Children's Orchestras of Ven-
ezuela. Born in Venezuela, Abreu
simultaneously achieved success
in both economics and music.
Today, El Sistema has established
more than 280 centers through-
out Venezuela. Recently, the Uni-
versity's School of Music, Theatre
& Dance piloted a version of El
Sistema at Ann Arbor's Mitchell
Elementary School.
Abreu was first nominated for
an honorary degree in 2012, but
was unable to attend the ceremo-
ny.
Coleman to preside over her
final commencement
As this year's crop of graduates
prepares to leave Ann Arbor for
new jobs and cities, commence-
ment will in some ways serve as
a graduation for Coleman. The
University's 13th president will
retire in July when President-
elect Mark Schlissel assumes the
presidency.
"As our graduates are enter-
ing a new phase, so am I," Cole-
man said. "Over my time here,
when I reflect back on the people
we've been able to honor, it will
be a little bit bittersweet that it is
my last, but I'm always so proud
on commencement day because
it reflects the ultimate goal that
we're all gettingto - havinggreat
young people going out into the
world."
for Michigan, which aims to be
the largest such initiative in the
history of public higher educa-
tion with a $4 billion goal. The
campaign aspires to raise $1 bil-
lion in financial aid for students
by the end of its run, which will
conclude during the tenure of
University President-elect Mark
Schlissel.
Additionally, Coleman and
her husband donated $1 mil-
lion of their own money to sup-
port students who plan to study
abroad.
At a Lansing Regional Eco-
nomic Club luncheon in Febru-
ary, Coleman said she will serve
on a number of boards during
her retirement, including con-
tinuing her efforts on the board
of directors of the pharmaceuti-
cal company Johnson & Johnson
and as a member of the National

Institute of Health's Advisory
Council. She will also co-chair a
project for the American Acad-
emy of Art and Sciences that
will examine the significance of
public research universities.
Coleman added that she plans
to keep a house in Ann Arbor to
attend football games in the fall.
"I won't be lying on a beach
anywhere," she said in February.

the decades, the taskforce has
been committed to creating pro-
fessional development opportuni-
ties for all staff."
Along with the keynote, the
event included more than 30
workshop sessions held at the
Modern Languages Building and
the Michigan League. All of the
sessions were centered on this
year's conference theme, "Trans-
forming the Face of Leadership."
The event closed with a recre-
ational ballroom dance demon-

The report also emphasized
a 42-percent increase in alco-
hol violations from the previous
academic year. In an interview
with the Daily, OSCR Director
Jay Wilgus said the statistic had
been on an upward trend for the
last five years, but the numbers
fluctuate and aren't a cause for
alarm. The number of violations
related to the possession of other
drugs also rose from 10 to 24
cases.
Sexual misconduct was a main
focus in this year's report. Of the
621 total violations, 83 involved
sexual misconduct - assault,
harassment, stalking or hazing
"of a sexual nature" - an increase
from the 71 reported the previous
year and the nine reported in the
2010 to2011academicyear.
"I think that's a good thing
because it shows that folks are
utilizing the systems available or
reporting sexual misconduct mat-
ters and having them addressed,"
Wilgus said.
The 2012 to 2013 academic year
was the last during which OSC
dealt with sexual misconduct
using the Interim Procedure for
Addressing Sexual Misconduct
Allegations Against Students,
which became effective in August
2011 while the University was
working on drafting a new per-
manent policy.
The interim procedure was
implemented after an 868-day
revision process of the Univer-
sity's sexual misconduct policy
after the U.S. Department of
Education issued a mandate in
2011 regarding how universities
should handle allegations of sex-
ual misconduct.
Under the Interim Procedure,
the University took a more inves-
tigative approach to those kinds
of allegations compared to its
approach under the preceding

complaint-focused model, which

American figure skater Jason

in Chicago with Glastris and
performed with her at the first

"(Glastris) is someone who

dealt with incidents of sexual
misconduct through its resolution
programs described in the State-
ment of Student Rights.
This year's annual report high-
lighted OSCR's use of the interim
procedure in collaboration with
the Office for Institutional Equity
to handle these 83 incidents. It
also worked with the OIE to move
from the interim procedure to the
new University of Michigan Poli-
cy on Sexual Misconduct by Stu-
dentsothat went into effectlAug. 19,
2013, and which will permanently
replace that interim policy.
In January, The Michigan
Daily reported that former kicker
BrendanGibbonswaspermanent-
ly separated from the University
on Dec. 20,2013 after being found
responsible for violating the Uni-
versity'ssexualmisconductpolicy
in 2009. The University used the
newest sexual misconduct policy
to handle the violation.
Regarding its future goals,
the report noted an effort to
continue "working with campus
partners to implement the UM
Policy on Sexual Misconduct by
Students and educate the cam-
pus community about it."
Wilgus said his office has also
been working with the Univer-
sity's Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center, Central
Student Government, ROTC,
the College of Engineering, the
Athletic Department and others
in an effort to educate the stu-
dent body about the new policy.
"Anybody who has time and
interest and wants to learn
about the policy, we go talk to,"
he said. "And then in addition,
key student populations where
we know there is a big audience
and there's a number of folks we
can get in front of at one time."
This year was the last that
sexual misconduct will appear
in the annual OSCR report In

A modern family
Michigan's ban on gay marriage is outdated and overdue on reform
his past week, a Michigan couple, April DeBoer and Jayne
Rowse, challenged the state's constitutional ban against gay
marriage. The state government's callousness toward gay
rights must come to an end, as the state's 2004 constitutional ban on
gay marriage is outdated and discriminatory. Michigan must reform its
marriage policies to treat same-sex couples equally and to ensure that the
children of same-sex couples will be able to remain with their parents.

Notes on the vortex
U '..s
NWFW) ~Ii RVIN

Currently, Michigan does not recognize
same-sex marriages, meaning that same-
sex couples are unable to share custody of
independently adopted children. Therefore,
neither DeBoer nor Rowse has custody over
the other's adopted children. In the event of a
catastrophe involving one woman, Michigan
law would not recognize the other parent's
custodianship of the first woman's adopted
children and could take the children away -
arbitrarily and cruelly destroying a family.
The fight for same-sex marriage is only
one of many movements that have emerged
in the last few years that reflect the growing
support for the LGBTQ community. In fact, in
a recent Gallup poll, nine out of 10 Michigan
residents already believed that there was
existing legislation protecting individuals
against discrimination based on sexuality.
Popular support and relevance of the 2004
state constitutional amendment today is
questionable, seeing that nine states legalized
gay marriage in the past year, as opposed to
the six that confirmed a ban. Three of the 17
states that permit civil unions were adopted
by popular vote. Thirty-three states currently
have constitutional amendments and state
laws banning gay marriage. However, the'
anticipated statutes run counter to the
majority opinion, as 59 percent of adults in
the United States supported gay marriage
according to a recent Washington Post-ABC
News poll.
There are many progressive movements

pushing Michigan to join other pro-equality
states. Efforts that promote LGBTQ equality
are rapidly coming to fruition. In Michigan,
a petition with more than 1,000 signatures
created the Royal Oak anti-discrimination
clause in 2013. In the same year, Federal
Judge David M. Lawson granted a preliminary
injunction against a state law that bans
domestic partners of employees of local
Michigan government and school districts
from receivingjobbenefits.. On a national level,
President Barack Obama's administration
is continuously working to extend marital
rights to LGBTQ couples. The legalization of
same-sex -marriage in Michigan wouldn't be
groundbreaking, but rather an overdue ruling.
Though Assistant State Attorney Kristin
Heyse has presented social research that
reveals the advantages of both a mother
and father figure in a child's life, it does not
imply that same-sex marriage households
are detrimental or not sufficient. And there
is no question that love and support from
two parents is as good as, if not better than,
those from one divorced parent. 58.6 percent
of voters approved the 2004 ban, but that
number is outdated and doesn't reffect the
views of today's voters. As LGBTQ support is
rising, the state government must take action
along with it. Governor Rick Snyder should
recognize that the ban on gay marriage is a
prominent concern and work toward reform
that accommodates the LGBTQ community's
demands and rights.

alking back from the
Intramural Sports
Building, my sweat
freezes my hair
against my fore-
head. It's incred-
ibly painful and
incredibly unat-
tractive, and it
makes me think
about winter.
wanting it to SOPHIA
end, hating the P
snow that turns USOW
into slush that
turns into ice
that turns into sprained ankles or
lost dignity, etc. It's a very pensive
moment, and I'm glad the walk
from the gym to my house is short
because thinking in the cold hurts.
Brains, like iPhones and glass beer
bottles, have extreme-temperature-
induced breaking points, and it's not
smart or polite to mess around with
such delicate gray equipment.
At my house everyone is pretty
Vitamin D-deficient and it shows.
Conversations trail off into languid
silences only to be broken by the
enduring question: When does
Dominick's re-open again? (March
10th, we only ask because we like
to hear the answer). The thought of
walking up the steep slippery hill
to go to class makes my spine ache,
but I already used up almost all of
my sick days in one week because I
just gave up and decided not to leave
the house. That week my bedroom
was warm. I burned candles to give
the tiny attic space - in which I
dreamed sweet dreams of men with
Tom Selleck mustaches feeding
me pork tenderloin, a nice "Little
House on the Prairie" glow. Humans
don't hibernate - that type of
thing is for woodchucks and garter
snakes - but with proper funding
and a little technological follow-
through I'm sure humanity could
make the Great Leap Forward into

collective seasonal unconsciousness.
Personally, I'd be thrilled to give
my body up to science for a cause so
noble. I'd love to be remembered by
the world as the Neil Armstrong of
not being awake.
On a more serious note, we're in
the midst of a full-figured Tastee-
Freez. While the Arroyo Seco gulps
at dusty runoff, here in the North
Country I'm starting to think this
downyprecipitation will never stop,
that we'll die in Frosty's cleavage.
The Republican Youth of America
and their benevolent leaders will
try to persuade you that the whole
Polar Vortex Carbon Apocalypse
thing is a figment of your overactive
liberal imagination, but I say trust
your instincts. Believe your eyes,
believe the steel-tipped icicles
dangling off the edge of Weill Hall,
believe the sinking feeling you get
when you see the 10-day forecast
that winks menacingly and growls,
It ain't over yet. It's real. It's scary.
It's cold in a way the Mayans could
never have dreamed.
Also, believe the cabin fever.
Winter's not a great time for a
transition period, but that's what
I'm in right now, moving perpetually
forward inside the bounds of a drafty
house. My friends and I curl chapped
hands around mugs filled with Irish
coffee and ask one another, When do
you think you'll get married? I want
to go to a wedding, want the spring
to break so loved ones will copulate
like bunnies and bring rosy things
into the world that I can hold and
hand back. Nobody I know is stable
enough to care for another human
life, but I wonder if maybe 40 years
ago they would have been. Back then
instead of murky wooden beer dens
we would have met in fluorescent-
bulbed produce aisles, bouncing
babies on our hips, already familiar
with their weight and the sticky
touch of their fingertips. Or maybe
not. Maybe we were always destined

to be this rudderless, this unattached.
I think of my grandmother, pregnant
at 19 in the howling Upper Peninsula
winter, tethered to a life in which she
could never growby my mother, who
left her womb to travel the world:
Cuba, Venice, the top of the highest
building in Hong Kong. Mygrandma
still lives in the house she moved into
with my grandpa in 1949. She talks to
me in the third person. Does Sophia
want another cookie? Has Sophia
grown or am I just shrinking?
Ice can evaporate without ever
becoming a liquid. It's a process
called sublimation and usually
occurs on sunny days when there is
low humidity and high winds. Mt.
Everest enjoys frequent sublimation,
but I've seen it happen at the corner
of Arch and State - ice rinks
shrinking and cracking in the face of
a cold sun. Psychologically speaking,
Freud believed that sublimation was
how humans dealt with undesirable
impulses in acceptable ways. Instead
of making love to snow banks
or barren tree branches, people
shoveled and built fires. Instead
of giving in to distasteful forms of
sadism, they become dentists. There
is no in-between in sublimation:
earth becomes air so fast you'd like
to imagine it was never anything
different, that the winter never
happened, that it was always
summer. Freud called it a defense
mechanism, but here at Michigan
we know better than that. We don't
care how the ice goes away or what it
becomes. We just hope for shorts and
warmth, camping and moonlight
swims, renewal and rebirth. We go
inside and wipe the frost off of our
faces and look longingly at pictures
of warmer places, knowing that
they are not for us. If we lived in
Florida we wouldn't be able to truly
understand the gift of spring.

PHOEBE YOUNG I
How to shave like a feminist

SORIN PANAINTE I
Questions left unanswered

This past summer my sister - a bubbly,
makeup-wearing, nail polished, perfumed
14-year-old - went on a wilderness trip with a
local YMCA summer camp program. For close
to two weeks she did a combination of rock
climbing, whitewater kayaking and hiking -
and she loved it. But there was something she
told me in the car on our way home that got to
me. Oneofher counselors on the trip, acrunchy
woman in her 20s who had just hiked the
Appalachian Trail, proudly touted unshaved
legs and armpits on the trip. She hadn't shaved
in months and wasn't planning on it anytime
soon, she told them. When my sister asked her
why, she said it was because men didn't shave
their legs or armpits, so she felt that she didn't
need to.
What gave me pause about this comment
wasn't that I disagreed with it. In fact, acouple
of years ago I would have felt inclined to
agree with her: if men don't do it, why should
women? But simply condemning a practice
just because men don't do it is too simple of
an outlook to take on the social roles women
and men occupy in our society. In fact, it's
regressive for feminism. Women don't need
to be like men to be worthy of equal value in
our society. What a woman wears or whether
she shaves her legs or applies makeup doesn't
make her less than any other man or woman.,
She is different, perhaps. But that difference
does not imply inequality of worth.
The idea that women should not shave their
legs, wear makeup or give as much thought
to their outward appearance simply because
men don't do the same things still hinges too
heavily upon the way a woman should look.
And because of that it can often implicitly per-
petuate the very thing that it seeks to eradicate
- a stigmatization of women based on their
appearance. While it should by no means be bad
not to wear makeup and not to shave your arm-
pits, it should not necessarily be better. The fact
that a woman or a girl wears makeup isn't an

implicit indication that she is unsatisfied with
her appearance. Though manytimes, it can be.
It's true that our society doesn't give enough
value to diverse appearances - our magazines,
beauty stores and movies all have eerily familiar
faces that have failed to evolve significantly
over the past 50 years. Oftentimes, wearing
makeup or shaving one's legs feels less like a
personal decision and more like a necessary
ritual performed in order to receive recognition
from others. We're not at the point in time
where we, as women, can have full autonomy
over the way we look - there are implicit
(and explicit) standards for what constitutes
attractiveness in our society. But that doesn't
mean we ought to condemn those who conform
to those standards.
What we need to realize is that condemning
that girl, like my sister - who wears makeup
or puts on perfume and paints her nails
everyday - effectively achieves the same
results as the people who tell her she needs
those things to feel beautiful. It alienates her
from her own control over her appearance.
And perhaps more importantly, it still focuses
on a notion of a "right" appearance for
women, one that excludes a particular subset
of females - the ones that wear makeup like
my sister.
Instead, in order for women to truly be
equal to men, we need a shift away from the
importance of female appearance - we need
to have a varied and equally valued array of
appearances that aren't stigmatized within
or outside of the female community. Equality
doesn't mean adopting the same customs as
men. It means demanding the same amount
of respect irrespective of whether or not we
choose to share those customs.
So to my sister I say: Shave your legs if you
want - or don't. You're still a feminist, what-
ever you do.
Phoebe Young is an LSA freshman.

By now everyone has heard of the
Brendan Gibbons scandal and the
University's handling of the situation.
Since 2009 the University has waited
four - yes, I'm serious - four years
to separate Gibbons from our Univer-
sity. It shouldbe noted that many rape
offenders often repeat their offense.
But there is one thing that the
University has not addressed, and
that is the role of offensive lineman
Taylor Lewan in the case. Itis alleged
that Lewan sent a text message to
the victim threatening "to rape her
because (Gibbons) didn't." At the
NFL scouting combine Lewan said
in his defense, "That's definitely a
situation between those two people
... I've said a lot of dumb things in
my life, but those are not things that
I've said ... I would never disrespect
a woman like that." Meanwhile, the
University has remained silent.

when I satdown ina quiet room for a
one-on-one interview with a living
legislative legend, Congressman
John Dingell (D-Mich).
Congressman Dingell had just
spoken next door in a crowded
room full of supporters inside a
United Auto Workers building in
Taylor, an industrial downriver
city about 30 miles away from the
University that is gerrymandered
into the same congressional district
as Ann Arbor.
It was Dingell's final congres-
sional victory. He had 29 of them.
Though triumph seemed a routine
occurrence for almost everyone in
the room that night, the congress-
man wasby no means complacent.
There was a genuine passion
for progress in Mr. Dingell's eyes,
and the 85-year-old had the same
fiery look you might see on an
idealistic, politically active college

It really isn't surprising that the
administration has said nothing. In
her Fireside Chat, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said, "I am
very comfortable with the process
and what happened. We have pretty
well-defined procedures that we
use." If those procedures involve
waiting four years then they are not
exactly the most efficient or just
procedures are they? We need new
procedures, separate from the Uni-
versity as it has proven itself unreli-
able, to deal with these situations.
The president is comfortable
that no charges were filed because
the University avoided heavy
scrutiny. Coleman stated that the
Athletic Department didn't play
a role in reviewing the case, but it
seems highly suspect since Gibbons
was only separated after his final
season was over. Why are we left in

the dark? It cannot be for student
protection because, if the University
had our protection in mind, it would
not have waited so long to act. We are
tuition-paying students of this public
university who deserve to live in a
safe environment.
One thing is indeed obvious, and
that is that the University is not
doing all it can to protect its stu-
dents. The administration has shown
that they're willing to let dangerous
crimes go unaddressed for years. It
remains to be seen if the University
will make any further comments
regarding "Gibbonsgate." Until then,
we are left with only questions left
unanswered, and the hope that the
Department of Education investiga-
tion will shed further light on the
University's handling of the case.

student who truly believes they can
somehow change their world.
He took public service seriously.
Any decent reporter can tell
when a politician is feeding them
the safe and memorized lines from
a campaign pamphlet, and that was
not the case that night or anytime
I interviewed the congressman. In
fact, I was honestly astounded at
Dingell's frankness.
Either Iwas just anaive collegekid
who didn't realize the congressman's
years of experience had given him
herculean ability for crafting nifty
and seemingly heartfelt sound bites
on the spot, or he was genuinely
speaking from the heart.
I don't know. Either way, Dingell
was at least talking to me - just some
college reporter. And that's more
than you can say for most politicians
these days.
If you're a member of the press,
especially at a college publication,
you're lucky to even get a politician's
staff person to respond to your
e-mail - even if it's days or weeks
ahead of time.
Yet there he was, speaking on

the record, as he had time and
time before with so many different
Michigan Daily reporters - the
one and only John Dingell, whose
vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964
helped change the country and made
it so my generation never had to see
how "equal" separate really is.
Despite his historic list of legisla-
tive achievements, Dingell sees him-
self as just another Michigander, and
he would talk to me not just abouthis
hope for America, but about his time
in the military and his experiences in
the wilderness with bears.
With a generation who knows
the name Frank Underwood and
a Washington, D.C. that seems
increasingly distant and unreliable
to so many Americans these days,
Congressman Dingell's penchant for
giving people at least a few moments
of his time, let alone new rights and
freedoms, was a very welcome sight.
We can only hope the next
generation of leaders takes a page
from his book.

Diversity has also played a
large role in the conversation
about access to higher educa-
tion. In the last few months, the
Black Student Union has gained
national media coverage for
bringing attention to the lack
of diversity at the University
by calling for increased minor-
ity enrollment - an increase
of Black students to 10 percent
- and more on-site recruiting
in underserved communities,
among other demands.
This issue is one that the
Department of Education is
also trying to combat. Duncan
explained that minority gradu-
ation and college attendance
rates have been on the rise in
recent years, but added that the
proposed budget could further
bolster these trends.
"We've seen some very sig-
nificant improvement over the
last couple of years," Duncan
said. "Graduation rates are at an
all-time high, largely driven by
increases in Black (and) Latino
graduation rates. More students
not just waiting, but going on to
college. But we know we have
a lot of hard work ahead of us.
We're not where we need to be."
Duncan said closing the
achievement gap will directly
contribute to increased college
readiness in underserved and

low-income communities, a goal
reflected by Obama's proposed
"Race to the Top" initiative.
The initiative would invest $300
million to target and fix com-
munities saddled with educa-
tional inequity.
The program would allow
the government to give grants
to underprivileged schools to
invest in stronger teachers,
technology, expanded learning
time and more access to "rigor-
ous coursework," according to
an Education Department press
release.
The goal is to bolster career
readiness and post-secondary
education readiness, which
Duncan said is as important as
improving college affordability.
Duncan added that increas-
ing college readiness is one step
toward a greater goal: reclaim-
ing the top spot in college
completion internationally. He
said this achievement would be
"essential for our nation's eco-
nomic prosperity," an argument
that would contribute to the
budget proposal's four pillars of
addressing affordability.
These include increasing the
federal government's invest-
ment in the First in the World
fund, which supports institu-
tional policies to decrease the
cost of higher education, to $100
million; increasing the maxi-
mum size of federal Pell Grants,
which the government gives to
more than 9 million low-income
college undergraduates each
all the nerves," Abdul-Nabi said.
"It felt like we knew the people
and we were actually a part of
the production."
After being introduced on
stage during the night of the
awards by actor Channing
Tatum, the six students were
each given four of the 24 awards
to deliver to the celebrities pre-
senting. Abdul-Nabi was on
stage for the presentation of the

year to help pay tuition; allotting
funds to establish a new college
ratings system; and investing
$75 million in a new "competi-
tive grant initiative that would
give minority-serving institu-
tions financial support.
Kelly Cunningham, Universi-
ty director of public affairs, said
these initiatives are promising
with regard to the University's
goals for the future.
"We are reviewing the bud-
get proposal details now, but we
do note an increase in the Pell
Grant amount, which could be
helpful for our students," she
wrote in a statement. "We'll
continue to evaluate the budget
and work together with our col-
leagues in Washington as the
budget season progresses."
In a press release, the Asso-
ciation of American Universi-
ties - of which the University
is a member - wrote that the
government's proposed bud-
get amendments would bolster
access to higher education, but
have left research funding by
the wayside.
"The President's FY15 bud-
get does disappointingly little
to close the nation's innova-
tion deficit," the AAU state-
ment read. "When it comes to
research, its modest spending
increases in a few key research
agencies are not sufficient to

U.S. claims
reunification
movement violates
international law
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin
on Sunday defended the sepa-
ratist drive in the disputed
Crimean Peninsula as in keep-
ing with international law,
but Ukraine's prime minister
vowed not to relinquish "a sin-
gle centimeter" of his country's
territory.
Over the weekend, the
Kremlin beefed up its military
presence in Crimea, a part of
Ukraine since 1954, and pro-
Russia forces keep pushing for
a vote in favor of reunification
with Moscow in a referendum
the local parliament has sched-
uled for next Sunday.
President Barack Obama has
warned that the March 16 vote
would violate international law.
But in-Moscow, Putin made it
clear that he supports the refer-
endum in phone calls with Ger-
man Chancellor Angela Merkel
and British Minister David
Cameron.
"The steps taken by the legit-
imate leadership of Crimea are
based on the norms of interna-
tional law and aim to ensure the
legal interests of the population
of the peninsula," said Putin,
according to the Kremlin.
Following an extraordi-
nary Sunday meeting of the
Ukrainian government, Prime
Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk
announced that he will meet
with Obama in Washington on
Wednesday on a "resolution of
the situation in Ukraine," the
Interfax news agency report-
ed. The White House con-
firmed the meeting.
"Our country and our people
are facing the biggest chal-
lenges in the history of mod-
ern independent Ukraine," the
prime minister said earlier in
the day. "Will we be able to deal
with these challenges? There
should only be one answer to
this question and that is: yes."

In an emotional climate
of crisis, Ukraine on Sunday
solemnly commemorated the
200th anniversary of the birth
of its greatest poet, Taras
Shevchenko, a son of peasant
serfs who is a national hero and
is considered the father of mod-
ern Ukrainian literature.
"This is our land," Yatse-
nyuk told a crowd gathered at
the Kiev statue to Shevchenko.
"Our fathers and grandfathers
have spilled their blood for this
land. And we won't budge a sin-
gle centimeter from Ukrainian
land. Let Russia and its presi-
dent know this."
"We're one country, one
family and we're here together
with our kobzar (bard) Taras,"
said acting President Oleksandr
Turchynov.
Later, Ukrainians in the tens
of thousands massed in the
Kiev's center for a multi-faith
prayer meeting to display unity
and honor Shevchenko. One of
the speakers, former impris-
oned Russian tycoon Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, almost burst
into tears as he implored the
crowd to believe not all Rus-
sians support their country's
recent actions in Ukraine.
"I want you to know there is
a completely different Russia,"
Khodorkovsky said.
In the eastern city of
Luhansk, however, people who
gathered in a square to cel-
ebrate Shevchenko's birthday
were attacked by pro-Russia
protesters, and some were
beaten up, local media reports
said.
Chanting "Russia! Russia!"
the demonstrators then broke
through a police barricade and
took over the local government
building, where they raised the
Russian flag and demanded a
citywide referendum on join-
ing Russia, Channel 5 and other
local media reported.
But it's Crimea, a strategic
peninsula in the Black Sea, that
has become the chief flash-
point in the battle for Ukraine,
where three months of pro-
tests sparked by President Vic-
tor Yanukovych's decision to
ditch a significant treaty with

the 28-nation European Union
after strong pressure from Rus-
sia led to his downfall.
A majority of people in
Crimea identify with Russia,
and Moscow's Black Sea Fleet
is based in Sevastopol, as is
Ukraine's.
In Simferopol, Crimea's capi-
tal, a crowd of more than 4,000
people turned out Sunday to
endorse unification with Rus-
sia. On Lenin Square, a naval
band played World War II
songs as old women sang along,
and dozens of tricolor Russian
flags fluttered in the cold wind.
"Russians are our brothers,"
Crimean Parliament speaker
Vladimir Konstantinov said.
He asked the crowd how it
would vote in the referendum a
week hence.
"Russia! Russia!" came the
loud answer.
"We are going back home to
the motherland," said Konstan-
tinov.
Across town, at a park where
a large bust of Shevchenko
stands, around 500 people,
some wearing yellow-and-blue
Ukrainian flags on their shoul-
ders like capes, came out to
oppose unification with Russia.
They chanted "No to the
referendum!" and "Ukraine!"
People handed out fliers, one
of which listed the economic
woes that joining Russia would
supposedly cause.
"We will not allow a foreign
boot that wants to stand on the
heads of our children," said one
of the speakers, Alla Petrova.
"The people are not scared. We
are not scared to come out here
and speak."
Some pro-Russians drove by,
shouting "Moscow, Moscow!"
from their cars, but there was
no trouble.
Associated Press reporters
in Crimea said all Ukrainian
television channels appeared
to have been taken off the air
by Sunday evening, save for one
that appeared to rebroadcast-
ing programs from Moscow-
based Russia-24.

EU says no guaranteed
success in nuclear deal

Iranian President
advocates energy
and transportation
cooperation with EU
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - The
European Union's foreign policy
chief said Sunday that there is
"no guarantee" that Iran and
world powers will reach a final
deal over the country's nuclear
program.
Catherine Ashton was in Teh-
ran for meetings with Iranian
officials on ongoing negotiations
over the country's nuclear pro-
gram, as well as the civil war
in Syria and other issues. She
spoke to reporters in a jointbrief-
ing with Iran's foreign minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif.
Separately, Iran's President
Hassan Rouhani advocated pur-
suing "new relations" with Euro-
pean countries that for years
have been at odds, alongside the
United States, with Tehran over
Iran's disputed nuclear program.
"Besides ongoing nuclear talks
that should be driven ahead,

there are other suitable fields in
which both Iran and European
Union can consider push rela-
tions and cooperation ahead,"
the president said in remarks
quoted by his website. He sug-
gested energy and transportation
cooperation.
Under an interim deal in
November, Iran agreed to limit
a key nuclear activity, uranium
enrichment, in return for easing
sanctions by the West.
Negotiations for a final deal
are ongoing. Ashton leads the six-
nation group - the U.S., Britain,
France, Russia, China and Ger-
many - in talks with Iran.
"I think this interim agree-
ment is really important, but
not as important as the compre-
hensive agreement that we are
currently engaged in. Difficult,
challenging, there's no guarantee
we'll succeed," she said.
Zarif said Iran will only accept
a deal that respects its "rights," a
referenceto uraniumenrichment
on its soil, while reiterating Iran's
longstanding position that his
country is not pursuing nuclear
arms.
"Iran will only accept a solu-

tion that is respectful, that
respects the rights of the Iranian
people," he said.
"At the same time Iran finds it
in its own interest to make sure
that there are no ambiguities
about Iran's intentions, because
we have no intention to seek
nuclear weapons."
The two said they had also
discussed fighting terrorism,
drug trafficking, and conflicts
in Afghanistan and Syria. Iran
is a key ally of Syrian President
Bashar Assad.
Under the historic deal, Iran
agreed to halt its 20 percent
enrichment program, but will
continue enrichment up to 5
percent. It also will convert
half of its stockpile of 20 per-
cent enriched uranium to oxide,
and dilute the remaining half
to 5 percent. Enrichment to 20
percent is a possible pathway to
nuclear arms.
The West suspects Iran's
nuclear program has a mili-
tary dimension. Iran denies the
charge, saying its nuclear activi-
ties are aimed at peaceful pur-
poses like power generation and
medical treatment.

Biden accusesVenezuela of
concocting' stories about U.S.

U.S. objects
to Venezuelan
declaration of
solidarity by OAS
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden
calls Venezuela's, situation
alarming in remarks published
Sunday, suggesting its govern-
ment is using "armed vigilantes"
against peaceful protesters and
accusing it-of "concocting false
and outlandish conspiracy theo-
ries" about the United States.
Biden's remarks, issued in
writing to a Chilean newspaper
in response to questions, drew
an angry rebuke from Venezu-
elan President Nicolas Maduro.

"We reject their aggression,"
President Maduro told sup-
porters at a rally the socialist-
led government held at the
presidential palace. "They were
defeated in the OAS and now
they want revenge."
The U.S. had strongly object-
ed to a declaration of solidar-
ity for Venezuela issued by
the Organization of American
States on Friday night.
Washington said the decla-
ration contradicted the OAS
charter, in part, by stressing
non-intervention in Venezuela
over guaranteeing that human
rights and free speech are
respected there. Twenty-nine
states voted in favor of Friday
night's declaration with only
the United States, Canada and
Panama objecting.

"The situation in Venezu-
ela reminds me of previous
eras, when strongmen governed
through violence and oppres-
sion; and human rights, hyper-
inflation, scarcity, and grinding
poverty wrought havoc on the
people of the hemisphere,"
Biden told El Mercurio.
"The situation in Venezuela is
alarming," he wrote. "Confront-
ing peaceful protesters with
force and in some cases with
armed vigilantes; limiting the
freedoms of press and assembly
necessary for legitimate politi-
cal debate; demonizing and
arresting political opponents;
and dramatically tightening
restrictions on the media" is not
what Washington expects from
a signatory to international
human rights treaties.

Authorities still
searching for
answers in case of
missing airliner
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
(AP) - Vietnamese aircraft spot-
ted what they suspected was one
of the doors of a missing Boeing
777 on Sunday, while troubling
questions emerged about how two
passengers managed to board the
ill-fated aircraft using stolen pass-
ports.
Interpol confirmed it knew
about the stolen passports but said
no authorities checked its vast
databases on stolen documents
before the Boeing jetliner depart-
ed Saturday from Kuala Lumpur
en route to Beijing with 239 people
on board.
Warning "only a handful of
countries" routinely make such
checks, Interpol secretary gen-
eral Ronald Noble chided authori-
ties for "waiting for a tragedy to
put prudent security measures
in place at borders and boarding
gates."
More than two days after
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370
went missing, the final minutes
before its disappearance remained
a mystery. The plane lost contact

with ground controllers some-
where between Malaysia and
Vietnam.
However, searchers in a low-
flying plane spotted an object that
appeared to be one of the plane's
doors, the state-run Thanh Nien
newspaper said, citing the deputy
chiefofstaffofVietnam's army, Lt.
Gen. Vo Van Tuan.
Two ships from the maritime
police were headed to the site
about 60 miles (90 kilometers)
south of Tho Chu island in the
Gulf of Thailand, the same area
where oil slicks were spotted
Saturday.
"From this object, hopefully
(we) will find the missing plane,"
Tuan said.
The missing jetliner appar-
ently fell from the sky at cruising
altitude in fine weather, and the
pilots were either unable or had
no time to send a distress signal
- unusual circumstances under
which a modern jetliner oper-
ated by a professional airline
would crash.
Authorities were checking on
the identities of the two passen-
gers who boarded the plane with
stolen passports. On Saturday,
the foreign ministries in Italy
and Austria said the names of
two citizens listed on the flight's
manifest matched the names on
two passports reported stolen in
Thailand.
"I can confirm that we have
the visuals of these two people
on CCTV," Malaysian Transport
Minister Hishammuddin Husse-
in said at a news conference late
Sunday, adding that the footage
was being examined. "We have
intelligence agencies, both local
and international, on board."
The thefts of the two pass-
ports - one belonging to Austri-
an Christian Kozel and the other
to Luigi Maraldi of Italy - were
entered into Interpol's database
after they were stolen in Thai-
land in 2012 and last year, the
police body said. But no authori-
ties in Malaysia or elsewhere
checked the passports against
the database of 40 million stolen
or lost travel documents before
the Malaysian Airlines plane
took off.
In a forceful statement, the
Interpol chief, who has called
passport fraud one of the world's
greatest threats, said he hoped
"that governments and airlines
worldwide will learn from the
tragedy."
"Now, we have a real case
where the world is speculat-
ing whether the stolen passport
holders were terrorists," Noble
said. "Interpol is askingwhy only
a handful of countries worldwide
are taking care to make sure that
persons possessing stolen pass-
ports are not boarding interna-
tional flights."
Troubling details also
emerged Sunday about the itin-
eraries of the two passengers
traveling on the stolen passports.
A telephone operator on a
China-based KLM hotline con-
firmed Sunday that passengers
named Maraldi and Kozel had
been booked on one-way tickets
on the same KLM flight, flying
from Beijing to Amsterdam on
Saturday. Maraldi was to fly on
to Copenhagen, Denmark, and
Kozel to Frankfurt, Germany.
She said the pair booked the
tickets through China Southern
Airlines, but she had no informa-

tion on where they bought them.
As holders of EU passports
with onward flights to Europe,

the passengers would not have
needed visas for China.
Interpol said it and national
investigators were working to
determine the true identities of
those who used the stolen pass-
ports to board the Malaysia Air-
lines flight. White House Deputy
National Security Adviser Tony
Blinken said the U.S. was look-
ing into the stolen passports, but
that investigators had reached
no conclusions.
Interpol has long sounded
the alarm that growing interna-
tional travel has underpinned
a new market for identity theft:
Bogus passports have lured
illegal immigrants, terrorists,
drug runners, pretty much any-
one looking to travel unnoticed.
More than 1 billion times last
year, travelers boarded planes
without their passports being
checked against Interpol's data-
base of 40 million stolen or lost
travel documents, the police
agency said.
In addition to the plane's
sudden disappearance, which
experts said was consistent with
a possible onboard explosion, the
stolen passports strengthened
concerns about terrorism as a
possible cause. Al-Qaida mili-
tants have used similar tactics to
try to disguise their identities.
Still, other possible causes
included a catastrophic failure
of the plane's engines, extreme
turbulence, or pilot error or even
suicide. Establishing what hap-
pened with any certainty will
need data from flight recorders
and a detailed examination of
any debris, something that will
take months if not years.
Malaysia's air force chief,
Rodzali Daud, said radar indicat-
ed that before it disappeared, the
plane may have turned back, but
there were no further details on
which direction it went or how
far it veered off course.
"We are trying to make sense
of this," Daud said at a news
conference. "The military radar
indicated that the aircraft may
have made a turn back, and in
some parts this was corroborat-
ed by civilian radar."
Malaysia Airlines Chief Exec-
utive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said
pilots are supposed to inform
the airline and traffic control
authorities if the plane does a
U-turn. "From what we have,
there was no such distress signal
or distress call per se, so we are
equally puzzled," he said.
A total of 34 aircraft and 40
ships from Vietnam, Malaysia,
Thailand, Australia, Singapore,
Indonesia, China and the United
States were deployed to the area
where ground controllers lost
contact with the plane, the mari-
time border between Malaysia
and Vietnam.
Of the 227 passengers and 12
crew members on board, two-
thirds were Chinese, while the
rest were from elsewhere in
Asia, Europe and North America,
including three Americans.
Family members of Philip
Wood, a 50-year-old IBM execu-
tive who was on board the plane,
said they saw him a week ago
when he visited them in Texas
after relocating to Kuala Lum-
pur from Beijing, where he had
worked for two years.
"There is a shock, a very sur-
real moment in your life," said
Wood's brother, James Wood.

"With a situation like this, when
a plane just disappears ... it leaves
you with a lot of questions."

Death and darkness seem to
always stir at the periphery of all
of Hayao Miyazaki's visionary
work ("Spirited
Away"). A wild A
dreamscape
drops over the The Wind
world. Uncer- Rises
tainty sets in,
then fear and Michigan
catastrophe, all Theater
of which sus- I
tain equal parts Walt Disney
of wonder and
terror. And yet time and time
again, Miyazaki saves us with-
out shutting us blind to harsh
realities, and with his latest fea-
ture, "The Wind Rises," perhaps
for the last time.
Miyazaki is retiring, an
announcement which we've
heard before from the legend-
ary anime director, but there's
a terrible certainty this time
around. In "The Wind Rises,"
he turns now to where his
mind has wandered these past
six decades - to his dreams, to
the sky. The whimsy of his past
films has been toned down for a
more somber film, and suitably
so. This is the story of Jiro Hor-
ikoshi (Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
"Don Jon"), the mastermind
behind the infamous World War
II fighter plane, the Mitsubishi
Zero.
Horikoshi knows that with
the creation of his vision comes
destruction. It will kill Chi-
nese soldiers, it will kill British
soldiers, it will kill American
soldiers. But history can wait;
history must wait. Horikoshi is
on a solitary path that to turn
from would mean the ruin of
all toward which he strives: He
must dream, he must create.
In scenes of destruction that
border on the apocalyptic, we
are reminded throughout the
picture that war draws near.
Miyazaki, as an animator, artist

and director, develops some of
his best work in his rendering of
the pandemonium of the Great
Kanto Earthquake.
We begin in blackness and a
long crack of dark light thatsplits
open the void. The land rolls like
a huge rug and the passengers of
a train hold tight. As the earth-
quake subsides we watch little
stones shake and shift among
each other. Equally impressive is
a shot of a crowd in its thousands
swarm for safety. Miyazaki's
work ethic has always stunned
American animators, and his
artistry here shows no less effort
nor imagination.
We often picture Japan, a
small island frequently struck
by earthquakes and tsunamis, as
a place of annihilation, but also
reassembly and growth, tied to
the past, pulling for the future.
Such themes are always pres-
ent in Miyazaki's films, in his
redemption-bound character.
Horikoshi is a visionary, who
by the end of the film, becomes
emblematic of all Japanese inno-
vation. His planes bear his own
auteuristic spirit and his love for
Japan in their graceful design
and forward-thinking mechan-
ics. In this way, Miyazaki finds a
kindred spirit in Horikoshi.
Most of the film concerns
itself with Horikoshi's journey
as an aerospace engineer, but
there are also incredible char-
acter moments in "The Wind
Rises." Much of the tertiary
cast relies on tropes, such as
the blue-eyed German named
Castorp (the great Werner Her-
zog, "Grizzly Man"), who recalls
the joie de vivre of Count Greffi
of Hemingway's A Farewell to
Arms. Still, Miyazaki enriches
each of these familiar themes
with his own brand of humor.
No character seems superflu-
ous. As Roger Ebert once wrote
of a hopping one-footed lamp
in "Spirited Away": "It is a gift
from Miyazaki."
Miyazaki's observations are

quiet, even generous. Each of
these scenes fill naturally with
their own sorts of rhythms and
images - slowly, with delight
and understanding, free of
action-driven plots. Discovery
should be its own pursuit.
We continuously return to
Horikoshi's dreams. We enter
rooms of working engineers.
The ceiling fades, and overhead
passes a plane they all envi-
sion at once, passes so close you
could run your fingers over the
length of its body. It is Horiko-
shi's dream, but they all see it
as clearly as he can, if only for
a moment, and now his plane
belongs to all of them.
In one of the first of these
dreams, a spirited Italian engi-
neer named Giovanni Caproni
(based on a real historical fig-
ure) demands to know how
"Japanese Boy" wandered into
his dreams. Then he invites him
to stroll along the wing of his
plane while it soars. It's a friend-
ship that will last his entire life
- between Italian and Japa-
nese - and they never even meet
in real life. Throughout "The
Wind Rises" aeroengineers fight
against the warhawk nationalist
energies that drive (and finance)
their projects. They want only
to create "beautiful dreams," as
Caproni says. "Engineers turn
dreams into reality." Miyazaki
illustrates the necessity of oth-
er-worldly thinkers like Horiko-
shi, and the collaborative nature
of invention in these shared
spaces of imagination, wherein
all minds unite toward one goal.
Here is a celebration fitting to
tie off Miyazaki's body of work
- bittersweet as a farewell, com-
forting as an ode to the future. A
monument to Japan's innovating
spirits, and the minds the world
over. Miyazaki may retire after
the many years he's sacrificed
in order to delight his audiences
and we will miss him. But what
a beautiful dream it truly has
been.

Latest '300' lacks grit

Hitmaker shoots
for charts with
meandering LP
By ADAM THEISEN
DailyArts Writer
Coming just months removed
from the Summer of Pharrell,
what were you really expect-
ing from this
album? Did B
you think it
was going to GIRL
be ten differ-
ent versions of Phafell
"Get Lucky"? Columbia
Would it be an
hour of pure
summer serving as a blast of
warmth in the middle of Febru-
ary? Would it be the smash-hit
album of the year? Well, despite
helping to create some of the
biggest singles of the past year,
Pharrell 'presents his second
solo album G I R L to remind
us that he's actually capable
of recording songs that aren't
number one hits. That's not to
say that G I R L is a disappoint-
ment, but, simply put, Pharrell
is not destined to be the super-
star that his record company
surely longs for him to be on the
strength of this LP.
This is not a batch of freshly-
cooked, radio-ready singles.
In fact, aside from "Happy,"
Pharrell's most recent world-
dominating song, the Jus-
tin Timberlake collaboration
"Brand New" seems to be the
only other promising hit. The
problem is that "Get Lucky"
tricked the world into thinking
that Pharrell had it in him to be
a great leading man, when real-
ly, he's so much better when he
works in a less prominent role.
"Lucky" worked because all it
needed from Pharrell's vocals
was functional catchiness.
Songs like "Blurred Lines" and
"Feds Watching," though, suc-
ceeded because Pharrell set the
stage with the production and
feel of the song, but then got out

of the way to let the main artist
perform.
On G I R L, Pharrell is that
main artist, so after' setting
the stage, he's still left to fill in
everything else. The results are
vocals that seem improvised,
tossed-off and goofy. His skill
as a lyricist is practically non-
existent (see "Hunter," which
features not only an incredibly
strained metaphor but also a
hilariously out-of-place "Duck
Dynasty" reference), and when
he tries to sing about girls, he
comes off like a teenaged son
of R. Kelly awkwardly trying to
imitate his dad.
The inescapable "Happy" is
the outlier here, but goddamn
it's an infectious one. "Happy"
is the song most reminiscent
of Pharrell's hits, and it's per-
fectly placed directly in the
center of the album in order to
give the lagging songs a boost.
While its appearance on the
'Despicable Me 2" soundtraek
may cause some to categorize it
as kids' music, nothing on the
album is more danceable or fun.
The track is further proof that
Pharrell can make some truly
inspired awesome pop music,
and its electric piano, clapping
and effortlessly natural singing
make it endlessly replayable and
an early contender for catchiest
song of the year.
Despite several A-List col-
laborators, the record is mostly
about Pharrell. Alicia Keys has
a mostly forgettable cameo, and
Miley Cyrus is in-and-out on the
record's dirtiest sounding track,
"Come Get it Bae." Daft Punk
also shows up on the chilled-out
"Gust of Wind" to provide its
familiar robot vocals. (Unfortu-
nately, no Daft Punk/Pharrell
track will ever live up to "Get
Lucky," and knowingly, the art-
ists avoid trying to recapture
lightning in a bottle.) The best
appearance comes from Justin
Timberlake, a man who knows
pop music just as well as Phar-
rell, and the two duet over an
enjoyable old-school soul beat.
The production of G I R L is

always on point and confident.
Harkening back to the soul
music of decades past, Pharrell
always plays to his strengths,
and perfectly utilizes groovy
drums and 70s guitars and key-
boards on nearly every track.
Pharrell's help is such an
incredible asset for any artist
trying to make the Top 40, but
he shouldn't carry all the weight
by himself His vocals wander
through his production - some-
times he tries to sound like Mar-
vin Gaye, and on "Lost Queen"
he picks up a vaguely African
accent, but he never sounds
sure of what he's doing. Open-
ing track "Marilyn Monroe" is
so overdone and changes what
it wants to be so much that it's
almost unbelievable that it's all
one track. Pharrell's sweet and
innocent voice makes all of his
boasts about women sound like
parody, and he just doesn't have
enough charismato carrymost of
the soul bongs.
Is G I-R L a failure? Well, it's
probably not what Pharrell's
record company was wishing for,
as it lacks any real attempts for
radio, aside from "Happy" and
maybe "Brand New." Listeningto
the weird meandering of most of
the tracks, it's hard to even imag-
ine how the record company let
this even happen.
However, taking it for what
it is, G I R L can be an admit-
tedly goofy, but enjoyable record.
Despite Pharrell's recent chart
successes, it's not the work of a
future superstar, a Bruno Mars-
like singer groomed for radio
smashes. Rather, it's the work
of a man in control of every
aspect of his album. All of Phar-
rell's strengths (his throwback
production and pop sensibili-
ties) and weaknesses (his lyrics
and vocals) are on full display
throughout G I R L. Pharrell
should mainly stick to produc-
tion work and features, but as
a novel peek inside the head
of a pop music genius, it's far
more memorable and fun than
anything a record company
could've tried to manufacture.

At the conclusion of what

Squad") cries an Empire

as though the
scribes of his-
tory patiently await their victory.
The Greek word for this kind of
unwavering arrogance is hubris;
difficult to establish and even
more difficult to later disregard,
hubris is a catalyst for self-implo-
sion. It destroys from within.
Success builds on success, blur-
ring logic, masking failure, until
infallibility becomes the only
worthy objective. Director Noam
Murro's ("Smart People") "300:
Rise of an Empire" falls victim to
its own hubris. With the effort so
desperate and the story so focused
on delivering the perfect tale of
masnulinity and war, the film's
sole objective actually becomes a
blueprint for failure.
The film's story runs concur-
rently (it's not so much a sequel
or a prequel to 2007's "300") with
the Spartan-Greek effort against
the Persians at Thermopylae and
also on the naval conflict between
Greek and Persian fleets. Them-
istocles, general of the Greeks and
renowned politician, believes that
a new political framework called
"democracy" can unite a divided

Greece. He's willing to go to war
against the Persians to prove it.
Vastly outnumbered and lacking
support from much of his own
nation, he utilizes his character-
istic cunning to deceive and belay
the onslaught of the herculean
Persian navy.
Artemisia (Eva Green, "Casino
Royale") commands the Persian
force. She's a brutal, manipula-
tive and dominating leader whose
power of intimidation escapes
no one. Make a tactical error and
she'll tie stone braces to your
arms and heave you into the
depths. Hold steady eye contact
with her and she'll plunge a dag-
ger into your gut. Green delivers
a convincing performance as the
intense, power-hungry queen of
moral depravity. Her tendency to
err on instinct rather than emo-
tion contributes to the warrior
mentality of her character. Green
leaves no room for sympathy or
affection - Artemisia is as cold as
the blade she so skillfully wields.
"Rise of an Empire" will
appease viewers if they think of
it like the able-bodied, fully func-
tional sidekick to the real hero,
the Zack Snyder-directed original
"300." Because of its less-than-
enthralling fight sequences,
perennialtalk of war and politics
and overall lack of personality,
"300: Rise of an Empire" seems
more anecdotal than essential.
Even though it depicts a parallel
story to the Battle of Thermopy-
lae, the film really feels like an
afterthought of Zack Snyder and
company, who thought it might
be really cool to make a movie
about ancient naval warfare.
With every slash of the sword,
a stream of blood trails across

the screen. Every warrior is an
acrobat, every strategic decision
a do-or-die plot against destiny.
The film begins and ends in the
same instance of violence: Sol-
diers charging, clashing, grap-
pling, smiting each other, tossing
bloodied carcasses into the briny
Aegean sea. Everything in
betweenis aremonstranceoffor-
mer wars and rivalries, comple-
mented by scenes of aggravated
sexual intensity, vengeance and
historical context. The whole
effort feels contrived - carefully
wrought from the minds of exec-
utives who wanted to outdo an
already rambunctious depiction
of Greek mythology and war.
Was another
'300' necessary?
Not really.
But while the film may
sometimes be self-indulgent,
single-minded and even sloppy
to achieve its end, it still thrives
within the context of its genre.
After-all, graphic novels should
be over-the-top. A film based on
a comic based on loose accounts
of a fantastical war should be
allowed to exaggerate some
details. Is a film about 300
men defending their country
in the face of imminent death
interesting? Absolutely. Is a film
about the simultaneous naval
effort of undaunted, politically
driven Greeks necessary? Not
really. But is it entertaining? You
betcha.

assuming you find the premise
appealing and those aforemen-

you off completely. Given some
time it may shed those flaws and
reach a quality comparable to
"Awake" and "Lone Star." Other-
wise, it will only fall into a trou-

giving a shot, but not even close
to being crowned the best show

was all the Wolverines.
Despite clinching the
conference title Tuesday
with a win over Illinois in
Champaign, they waited until
Saturday night to enjoy it on
their own court. And when
the final buzzer sounded, the
moment belonged to this year's
Michigan team, and it savored
every moment of it.
The attention was on the
present celebration, not the
past. Not of the memories of a
dejected Trey Burke walking
off the court in Atlanta last year
with his head down and his back
to a different team.

team's lone senior was honored
before the game during Senior
Day festivities, and he had a
special night on the court to
go along with the occasion.
Morgan scored 15 points and
finished with 10 rebounds in his

Cheers of "J-Mo, J-Mo"
rained down from the student

crowd in singing a passionate

"It was a blast," Morgan said
during the celebration. "It's

of guys that people counted out,

As the confetti continued
to fall, a ladder was set up
underneath Michigan's basket,
and Morgan made his way to the
hoop. He cut off a small piece -
just enough of a reminder of the
accomplishment without losing
sight of the bigger goal.

Morgan was followed by
other Wolverine players who
climbed the ladder to get a piece
of the net - some who started
every game and others who
rarely got minutes.
Some were highly recruited
in high school and others
walked on at the beginning of
this season. Some have many
games at Crisler Center ahead

Each took the scissors to the

that ended with confetti falling

Nine Michigan facts we know to be true

This is all new and a
little overwhelming. All
you know as true is no
longer true.
Michigan is a
... basketball
school?
These
are heady
times for
Michigan. A
bit confusing, ZACH
too. The HELFAND
Michigan
men's
basketball
team has won the Big Ten
title with surprising ease.
The football and hockey
teams seem, respectively,
overpowered and inconsistent.
No one is quite sure how to
act. To help you navigate this
strange, new basketball world,
here is a revised list of truths
for the Michigan sports fan.
This is what we know to
be right. This is what you can
believe in.
1. The underclassman is
king.
Nik Stauskas climbed the
ladder to cut down his portion
of the net. The Crisler Center
cheered just a little louder than
for anyone else.
This was Senior Day for
Jordan Morgan, but it was
likely Stauskas' farewell game
too. He held up the net and
waved to the crowd.
By now, the panic is familiar.
Each April, the same questions
appear, just with different
names.
Will Manny Harris stay?
(No.) Darius Morris? (No.) Trey
Burke? (Yes. Then no.) Glenn
Robinson III? Mitch McGary?
Stauskas?
Rather quickly, Michigan
has become dependent on its
youngest players. This is a good
problem to have. But for the
foreseeable future, Michigan

will only go as far as its
underclassmen take it.
Believe in the underclassmen.
You don't really have any other
choice.
2. Glenn Robinson III is
better than you think.
But cut Michigan fans a
break on this one because
they're new to this basketball
thing. Most players are not
Burke or Stauskas or Caris
LeVert.
Most develop slowly and
unpredictably. Most are like
Robinson.
Believe in him, and he
may reward that belief with
important 3-pointers from the
corner.
3. November is
meaningless.
This one should be easy
to remember: Michigan
basketball in November is about
as meaningful as Michigan
football in November has been.
(Read: not much.)
Sure, the early part of the
season reveals a little about
a team. But try to reserve
judgment and panic until New
Years to avoid ridicule later.
Consider: Michigan State
probably should've lost to
Columbia. North Carolina lost
to Belmont. Michigan lost to
Charlotte.
The Wolverines have
rebounded admirably from that
most grave of setbacks. They
somehow clawed back from the
adversity of early losses to Iowa
State, Duke and Arizona.
Believe in March. Believe
in April. Beware of the false
prophets of November.
4. The 1-3-1 zone is
applicable in all situations.
The power of the 1-3-1
zone is boundless. The zone
hypnotizes opposing offenses.
It bewildered Indiana
Saturday, creating 12 second-

half turnovers and powering
Michigan's win.
Beilein has been shy to use
the 1-3-1 because, he says, he's
afraid of surrendering easy
3-pointers. That's logical. But
teams don't have much time
to prepare for the zone, and
it almost always succeeds in
slowing down a hot offense, at
least for a few possessions.
Beilein has learned to use
it more, and so can you. Put it
down when you're stumped
on your next Stats exam. With
four friends, use it to mystify
the bouncers at Rick's and cut
the long line. When driving
the caravan to the Big Ten
Tournament, put three people
in the middle row and one in
the back.
The 1-3-1 is good and just.
Believe in the 1-3-1.
5. Beilein knows what he's
doing.
When in doubt, reread No. 3.
Then No. 4.
6. Spike Albrecht has
never actually committed a
blocking foul.
Well, sure he has. He
probably committed multiple
against Indiana. But he scored
17 points in the freaking
National Championship Game,
so when he gets whistled for
three blocking fouls in15
minutes of play against the
Hoosiers, you're outraged with
the calls.
Believe in Spike Abrecht.
Believe in the charge.
7. Nik Stauskasjumper.
Believe in the jumper
(because you probably don't
have much time left).
8. Caris LeVert has a plan.
LeVert is shifty, but not in the
way other players are shifty.
On Saturday, Yogi Ferrell
bounced and bounded past

Sophomore forward Nik Stauskas may have played his final game at the Crisler Center and cut down the nets Saturday.

defenders. Ferrell was shifty.
Ferrell was smooth.
Trey Burke could change
speeds and control the tempo of
a game. He glided through the
lane. Burke was shifty. Burke
was smooth.
LeVert is not smooth. LeVert
is shifty - like a kid learning to
drive a manual transmission is
shifty. He lurches and stops and
then accelerates much faster
than anticipated.
And then the ball goes in.
Nothing wrong with that.
Believe in LeVert.
9. Championships feel like
this.
There's confetti on the
ground at the Crisler Center,
and the place is still mostly

full. Charles Woodson is posing
for photos with the team. The
rim is bare, because Beilein is
holding the net above his head.
Atop a ladder, he waves it
and, to no one in particular,
says, "Thank you, thank you,
thank you."
Then he climbs down and
smirks and looks out to a full
crowd to tell a story.
"Kathleen just reminded me,"
he says, referring to his wife.
"When we came here seven
years ago, there was about three
or four thousand people at our
first game. My son, Andy, said
to me, 'Tell me again why we
came to Michigan?"'
Nearby, Stauskas is searching
for his maize and blue Canadian
flag. Jordan Morgan, in tears

at his farewell hours earlier,
smiles big.
Moments ago, Tom Crean
walked, briskly and alone,
through the tunnel, scowling
so severely that his lower lip
nearly touched his nose, as if he
were trying to swallow his own
head.
Now, Derrick Walton Jr. and
Zak Irvin hold up the trophy:
Michigan is the outright Big
Ten Champions for the first
time in almost three decades.
"Tonight showed why people
come to Michigan," Beilein
says.
Believe it.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior left-hander Haylie Wagner couldn't makeup for Michigan's offensive struggles as it faltered to a 2-3 weekend.
Softball struggles in Classic

M goes 2-3, bats
fall silent
ByMAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team
spent its Spring Break brushing
up on basic probability.
The takeaway? Odds are even
the best teams in the nation will
hit a rut sooner or later.
Playing against three top-10
teams in two days, the fifth-
ranked Wolverines faltered
early in the Judi Garman Classic.
Michigan (16-6) couldn't get its
bats swinging for the second
time in three weekends. Only
this weekend, the pitching staff
wasn't able to bail the offense
out every time.
The Wolverines were shut
out to open the weekend, losing
2-0 to No. 10 Arizona State.
Freshman right-hander Megan
Betsa got the start, but allowed
six base runners and one run in
just over an inning before being
taken out in favor of junior left-
hander Haylie Wagner. Wagner
played the role of stopper,
holding the Sun Devils (22-3) to
only one run the rest of the way.
Despite having one of the
strongest lineups in the nation,
on paper, the Wolverines have
struggled to hit the ball lately,
including this weekend. Except
for offensive outbursts against
UCLA and Utah Valley, they've
been held to just 13 runs over

their last eight games.
"We'll be fine when we hit the
ball the way we have in batting
practice," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "We need to trust
our preparation and our game."
But the Michigan offense
couldn't put runs on the board or,
for that matter, even batters on
base. Senior Nicole Sappingfield's
sixth-inning single was
Michigan's only hit of the game.
There wasn't much time to
regroup, though, before the
Wolverines took the field against
No.6 Washington.
The offense only scored one
run in that contest as well and
fell victim to a new problem.
Whereas Michigan struggled
to get runners on base against
the Sun Devils, it had plenty on
base against the Huskies - it
just couldn't get them across
home plate.
The Wolverines had 10 hits,
all by their first through sixth
hitters, but stranded nine
runners. The bottom of the order
went 0-for-8 with a walk.
Though the pitching staff
bailed out the struggling bats on
multiple occasions before, this
time it could not. Junior right-
hander Sara Driesenga allowed
six runs on 12 hits in 3.1 innings
pitched. Considered Michigan's
top pitcher to start the year,
Driesenga has been inconsistent
early on.
"Sometimes pitchers are in a
groove and sometimes they're
not," Hutchinssaid."(Driesenga)

just has to work through it."
Following a loss to unranked
Houston the next day, Wagner
took to the circle and stopped the
skid, shutting out No. 7 Arizona.
The lefty allowed just four
hits in a complete-game win,
as sophomore left fielder Sierra
Lawrence's two RBI helped the
Wolverines to a 3-0 win.
Hutchins gave the ball back
to Wagner the next morning
against Texas, and she didn't
disappoint, going all seven
innings again and striking out
eight batters. Senior Lyndsay
Doyle went 3-for-4 with 2 RBI in
the 3-0 victory.
But even in the back-to-
back wins, the offense was still
troubling. Doyle's performance
was more than half the
Wolverines' output, putting
pressure on Wagner to pitch as
well as she did.
"I just take it in and throw one
pitch at a time," Wagner said. "I
embrace it and I really enjoy it."
That attitude shone through
for Wagner this weekend.
Her performance in the circle
ultimately salvaged a 2-3
showing for her team.
The woes on offense may not
persist long for the Wolverines,
but their coach plans to make
sure they don't forget about
them completely.
"We had a lot of teachable
moments this weekend,"
Hutchinssaid. "Whenwechange
our behavior then I'll know that
we've learned from them."

another snowy week training
in Ann Arbor, the team decided
to hit the sun and sand with a
training trip to Puerto Rico.
And Friday, the third-ranked
Wolverines' (10-0 Big Ten, 17-0
overall) trip culminated in a
matchup against the Puerto
Rican National Team and No.
5 Penn State. The week-long
vacation didn't affect Michigan's
successful season, after it
finished the night on top with a
final score of 438.80.
The Wolverines' first rotation
of the night was floor exercise,
where junior Stacy Ervin earned
a 16.10, the first floor score
over 16 points in the country
this season. Not far behind
was senior Sam Mikulak, who

walked away with a 15.60.
On pommel horse, junior Nick
Hunter earned the top score with
a 14.80. On still rings, Mikulak
and senior Jordan Gaarenstroom
tied with a pair of15.10s.
Mikulak again led the way on
the fourth rotation - the vault
- with a 15.30. Freshman and
Puerto Rico native Tristan Perez-
Rivera tallied a 15.20, while
sophomore Konner Ackerman,
who recently returned from an
injury, earned a 15.00 on vault.
On parallel bars, senior Syque
Caesar earned a 15.50 and
Hunter earned a 15.05. Michigan
closed out the night with a solid
performance on high bar, where
Caesar earned the top spot again
with a 14.70.
Though the scores were
lower in the final rotation, the
Wolverines landed all five of their
highbar routines, somethingthey
have struggled to do this season.
"Hitting 5-for-5 on high bar

(was a highlight)," said Michigan
coach Kurt Golder. "Even though
our score didn't reflect that."
This training trip was not
only an opportunity for the
Wolverines to compete against
another top-10 team, but also
a chance to get away from the
cold weather.
"Getting a change in pace from
a long, hard winter is always
refreshing," Golder said. "To
me, it seems like if you kept your
team on campus (during spring
break), it would almost seem like
a punishment."
Golder said the team was able
to balance training time and
relaxation time throughout the
week. In the afternoons, they'd
have a three-hour practice, then
spend the evenings either on the
beach or exploring San Juan.
Now it's back to Ann Arbor for
a return to the road ahead, and
the season, not the weather, is
heating up.

The Michigan hockey team

Ice Arena for

but Friday, MICHIGAN ST. 1
it scored
enough for an entire series.
Behind three second-period
goals and a hat trick from junior
defenseman Andrew Sinelli, the
11th-ranked Wolverines trounced
the Spartans, 7-1, for their third
straightwin over the rivals.
It took Michigan just 56
seconds and only one shot to get
on the scoreboard. Making the
most of a turnover and confusion
behind Michigan State's net,
junior forward Alex Guptill slid
a pass into the slot through two
defenders, where senior forward
Derek DeBlois found twine.
By the end of the second frame,
the Wolverines were scoring
with such ease that each goal
was little cause for celebration.
When Sinelli's innocuous wrister
caromed in off a Spartan player
for Michigan's fifth tally of
the evening, the junior simply
shrugged.

out MSU
"My first two goals were
garbage," Sinelli said.
Michigan's offense took just
17 shots through 40 minutes
but tallied in nearly every way
imaginable.
And in the second period, the
Wolverines scored more goals (3)
than Michigan State had shots (1).
"That's the most dominant
period I think we've had all
year," said sophomore netminder
Steve Racine. "We just really
took it to them."
Less than six minutes into
that second period, Michigan's
suddenly potent power play
struck on its first opportunity of
the night. Guptill again played
his part with an assist, taking a
hard wrister that junior forward
Zach Hyman redirected to make
it 3-1.
Even Spartan defenseman
RJ Boyd played his part with
an inadvertent deflection of
a centering pass from junior
forward Phil Di Giuseppe into
his own net to bury his team in a
three-goal hole.
Sinelli added his first before
the intermission.
"College hockey is a game
of momentum," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson.

Michigan's two-headed monster

EAST LANSING -
Michigan hockey, how
do you know which
version of your team will show
up on a given night?
How do you know when the
12th-ranked Wolverines that
won 7-1 against the fifth-place
team in the Big Ten, or the ones
that lost 4-3 to the same team
the next day,
will come to
play?
At what
point did

Michigan
State would
bounce GREG
back from GARNO
the loss
on Friday
night? Did you not focus on
staying even-keeled after you
won? Or was there a point
when you thought the Spartans
would go away without a fight?
Was something said to the
same 21 players on Saturday
night that was different than
Friday night? Was it an attitude
change, fast-spreading virus
or breakup that caused you
to drop off from the 3-1 lead
you held at the end of the first
period? Or the 3-2 lead you held
at the end of the second frame?
Did you miss your captain,
senior defenseman Mac
Bennett, that much on
Saturday? Did you struggle to
pick up the intensity late in the
game without him?
After the third goal was
allowed in the third period, did
you notice how the rest of the
team responded without saying
anything or hanging its heads?
Or did you notice after the
fourth goal was let in minutes
later and your goaltender,
sophomore Steve Racine,
shook his head? Weren't you
uncomfortable as Munn Ice

Senior forward Luke Moffatt had a goal and an assist Saturday against the Spartans, but the Wolverines were still upset.

Wolverines falter
late, fall to Sparty

EAST LANSING - A
frustrating,
eye- HOCKEY SATU
opening MICHIGAN 3
loss to MICHIGAN ST.4
Michigan
State in late December seemed
like a distant memory for the
Michigan hockey team. That is,
until Saturday night.
The 11th-ranked Wolverines
failed to cap off their fourth
consecutive victory over the
Spartans (4-8-6-4 Big Ten,
10-16-7 overall), eventually
stumbling to a 4-3 loss at Munn
Ice Arena.
The Wolverines' (9-7-2-1,
17-11-4) third line anchored a
high-flying offense that scored
10 goals over the weekend. Both
sophomore forward Boo Nieves
and junior forward Phil Di
Giuseppe tallied a goal and two
assists Saturday, while senior
forward Luke Moffatt had one
of each.
"They got off to a good
start," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "They played well all
weekend, and I think they're all
getting confidence. The puck was
going in for them."
"Our mistakes were costly."
But those three goals weren't
enough to stave off a hungry
Michigan State squad that scored
two goals just 73 seconds apart in
the final period.
Spartan forward Mike
Ferrantino jammed home a
rebound midway through the
frame to tie the game at three.
Moments later, Mackenzie
MacEachern skated untouched
into the offensive zone and
sored offawwrist shot from

the left circle to complete the
comeback.
Even a few shining moments
in the offensive zone couldn't
will Berenson's squad to victory.
Nieves earned his highlight-reel
goal with a move that pushed
the puck between his legs and to
his backhand before he roofed
a shot over goaltender Jake
Hildebrand at the 4:43 mark of
the first period.
Moffatt's tally came just 1:15
into the game, when he fired a
wrister from the slot for his 11th
goal of the season. And it was
Moffatt who pushed a cross-ice
pass to Di Giuseppe, who scored
his third goal in as many games
off a wicked slapshot from the
right point.
But the frustrating collapse
was looming for much of the
game. After Michigan's two
early goals, the Spartans had an
answer every time their backs
were against the wall.
"It's really tough," Nieves
said. "It's hard to pick the
positive things out after giving
up a lead like that."
With four minutes to play
in the second period, forward
Lee Reimer cut Michigan's lead
to one with a power-play goal
from the point, and that came
after forward Greg Wolfe was
credited with a much-needed
goal at 11:58 of the first period.
As Wolfe pushed the puck
toward the slot, it took a
deflection off freshman forward
Tyler Motte and trickled past
sophomore goaltender Steve
Racine to cut the Wolverines'
deficit in half.
What had been a locker room
full of smiles the previous night
was replaced by a sea of scowls
