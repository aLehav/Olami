CAMPUS NIGHTLIFE
New watering hole opens in South Campus

Dance Marathon surpasses
last year's fundraising total

Packard Pub owner
says business was
strong during
first weekend
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
Some students took a break
from the South University Ave-
nue bar scene to test out Packard
Pub, a new bar that opened this
weekend on the corner of Pack-
ard and State streets. The bar,
which is the only one in the stu-
dent-heavy South Campus neigh-

borhood, opened to long lines on
Friday night.
"We've been open two days,
and it's been a full house from
6 p.m. to 2 a.m.," Packard Pub
owner Kyle Miller said in an
interview yesterday.
Miller said the chance to lease
the pub's space fell into his lap
after a diner at his other restau-
rant, Buffalo Wings & Rings in
Chesterfield, Mich., told him
about the space.
Though Miller didn't officially
sign the lease until Oct. 1, 2009,
renovation had already started on
the space beginning in Septem-
ber. Before Packard Pub moved
in, Artisan Bistro, an organic

cafe, occupied the space.
Miller said the bar's early suc-
cess is partly due to its spot close
to students, but far away from
other bars, adding that one of the
most important aspects to start-
ing a business is "location, loca-
tion."
With maize and blue colored
walls and a mural of the Big
House, the sports bar gives stu-
dents the opportunity to watch
a variety of sporting events in a
spirited atmosphere. The bar also
features six cable boxes so own-
ers can air multiple college and
professional sports games at the
same time.

Participants raised
$425,762.48 in
event's 13th year
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Early Saturday morning, hun-
dreds of University students in the
Indoor Track Building posed in a
running stance, ready to go. As a
voice countdown reached zero, the
students were released and sprint-
ed toward the stage, jumping up
and touching a "Go Blue!" banner
as they ran underneath.
And the motion didn't stop for

the next 30 hours of the Universi-
ty's 13th annual Dance Marathon.
For the marathon, students
make a commitment to remain
on their feet for 30 hours to raise
money for children with illnesses
at the University's C.S. Mott Chil-
dren's Hospital and Beaumont
Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.
Dance Marathon, which is one of
the largest student-run nonprofit
organizations on campus, divides
participants into teams that build
relationships throughout the year
with the families they are support-
ing.
Last year, the event raised
$388,134, which was used for pedi-
atric rehabilitation programs. Par-

ticipants this year surpassed last
year's fundraising mark, bringing
in a total of $425,762.48.
Participants have to raise at
least $300 to participate in the
event. That money is supplement-
ed by general donations and corpo-
rate sponsorships.
LSA sophomore Gaurang Garg,
who participated in the event, said
he was shocked and excited to
see such a high amount of money
raised atthis year's marathon.
"It really shows what people
can do when they put the benefit
of others above their own selves,"
Garg said.

At Cornell, fences added to bridges

Temporary fences are currently
being installed along campus bridges
at Cornell University in response to
the suspected suicides of three Cornell
students earlier this month, The Cor-
nell Daily Sun reported on March 24.
In addition to the fences, the arti-
cle reported that security guards
will be stationed by the bridges until
about April 2. Security is expected to
increase when students return to cam-
pus from their spring breakthis week.
"(They'll only be) in place until a
longer-term solution is ready to be
implemented," Cornell spokesperson
Simeon Moss said in the article.
According to the article, the three
students that died earlier this month
are thought to have committed sui-
cide in Fall Creek Gorge.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MAY
REMOVE GUEST HOURS
The Residence Hall Association
at the University of Texas at Austin
recently passed a resolution to allow
guests to stay in student dormitories
at all hours, according to a March 23

article in The Daily Texan.
Bobby Jenkins, RHA president
at UT and sponsor of the legislation,
said in the article that the current
policy deters students from living in
residence halls on campus.
According to the article, residents
cannot have guests between midnight
and 9 a.m. on weeknights and 2:30
a.m. and 9 a.m. during the weekend.
"We're not able to compete with
off-campus entities or attract return-
ing students to the dorms because of
this policy," Jenkins said.
Some students said they weren't
pleased by the new resolution.
"People will be louder, people will
stay longer...people may not report
violations," Minae Noh, the president
of Kinsolving Residence Hall Council,
said in the article.
The article reported that the RHA
is currently trying to convince UT.
officials to adoptthe new policy.

Lawyer wants to question Pope Benedict XVI under oath


Documents reveal
Pope may have hid
molestation case
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Jeff
Anderson has filed thousands of
lawsuits alleging sex abuse by
priests and won tens of millions of
dollars for his clients, but he has
had a bigger goal in mind for nearly
two decades. He wants to bring his
career-long legal crusade against
misconduct in the Roman Catholic
Church right to the top.
He would love to question Pope
Benedict XVI himself under oath.
Though that is extremely unlikely
given that the pope is a head of
state, documents Anderson has
unearthed have the potential to
take a scandal that has plagued
dozens of dioceses around the
world and place it at the doorstep of
Vatican leadershio.

The documents, which became
publicly known in the past week
after Anderson shared them with
The New York Times, show that a
Vatican office led by the pope, then
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, halted
a church trial against a Wisconsin
priest accused of molesting some
200 boys at a school for the deaf.
"This is a tipping point," Ander-
son said. He found the documents
in handling one of the dozens of
lawsuits he has pending against
various church officials, and hopes
to use them to bolster a separate
federal lawsuit against the Vatican
itself.
Since 1983, Anderson and the
five other attorneys at his down-
town St. Paul firm have sued thou-
sands of Catholic priests, bishops,
and dioceses over allegations of
sexual abuse by priests and other
church leaders. He claims to have
no idea how much he has won in
settlements: in 2002 he estimated

that it was around $60 million.
"It's not about the money,"
Anderson told The Associated
Press.
The self-described "former athe-
ist" who rediscovered faith in God
through his recovery from alcohol-
ism professes a deep empathy with
abuse victims - he calls them "sur-
vivors."
More than a decade after his
legal battles with church officials
began, Anderson's adult daughter
revealed that as an 8-year-old she
was molested by a therapist she was
seeing as Anderson and his first
wife were going through a divorce.
The therapist, Anderson said, was a
former Catholic priest.
Anderson, 62, said the pain of
that revelation "brought another
dimension to the experience." But
he said he concluded years earlier
that the responsibility for shuffling
around problem priests and cover-
ing up their indiscretions would

extend to the Vatican.
"I came to the stark realiza-
tion that the problems were really
endemic to the clerical culture, and
all the problems we are having in
the U.S. led back to Rome," Ander-
son said. "And I realized nothing
was goingto fundamentally change
until they did."
The Wisconsin documents tie
Benedict, who as cardinal led the
Vatican's Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, to the deci-
sion in the mid-1990s not to defrock
the Rev. Lawrence Murphy despite
allegations that the Milwaukee
priest molested some 200 deaf boys
from 1950 to 1975.
The Vatican is defending that
decision, saying the case reached
the Vatican only in 1996, two years
before Murphy died. Church offi-
cials also say Murphy had repented
in a letter to Ratzinger, and that the
case's statute of limitations had run
out. They decry criticism over the

case as an effort to smear the pope.
The Milwaukee lawsuit does
not name Pope Benedict or other
Vatican leaders as defendants, but
Anderson hopes to use it to bol-
ster a separate lawsuit filed eight
years ago in U.S. District Court in
Oregon.
In that case, an unidentified
plaintiff claims he was sexually
abused as a teenager in 1965 or 1966
by the Rev. Andrew Ronan at St.
Albert's Church in Portland, Ore.
According to court documents,
Ronan was accused of abusing boys
in the mid-1950s as a priest in the
Archdiocese of Armagh, Ireland.
He was transferred to Chicago,
where he admitted abusing three
boys at St. Philip's High School, and
after that was sentto Oregon.
The church removed Ronan
from the priesthood in 1966. He
died in 1982.
The lawsuit says the Vatican
had to approve the international

transfer. The Holy See claims it is
protected by the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act, which prohibits
U.S. lawsuits against foreign coun-
tries.
Several lower courts have pro-
duced differing rulings on the suit,
and the Holy See has appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court to settle
the question. The high court has
not decided whether it will hear
the case.
Anderson said his legal team will
attempt to use documents from the
Milwaukee lawsuit to show the
Vatican was heavily involved in
decisions about how to deal with
problem priests.
Legal scholars have long been
skeptical of Anderson's chances of
penetrating the Vatican's foreign
sovereignty. He said it may be diffi-
cult to persuade judges to consider
documents from another lawsuit,
but added that he feels "closer than
we've ever been before."
"If there's anyone to press this
case, it's Jeff," said David Clohessy,
national director for Survivors Net-
work of those Abused by Priests,
a longtime ally of Anderson. "Jeff
doesn't get sole credit, and he
wouldn'tclaimit, buthewas among
the very first to see the magnitude
of this cover-up and is still among
the most dedicated to its undoing."
Jeffrey Lena, the Berkeley,
Calif.-based attorney for the Holy
See in the Oregon case, declined to
comment for this story.
Andrew Eisenzimmer, a lawyer
for the Archdiocese of St. Paul and
Minneapolis, has sparred frequent-
ly with Anderson and declined to
be interviewed. In earlier inter-
views with the AP, he described
Anderson as "prone to exaggera-
tion" but also said he's been unde-
niably successful.
Anderson has always had a flair
for the public relations aspect of
his work, and a visit to his office
the day after the Milwaukee story
broke found him fielding interview
requests from numerous media
outlets as lawyers and researchers
combed through documents on the
large, dark wood table in his office.
Anderson was raised Lutheran
and his first wedding was in the
Catholic Church, though he said
his spiritual journey no longer
involves church attendance. His
office, however, is full of religiously
symbolic art and sculpture, as well
as items salvaged from churches
- including a kneeler and confes-
sional booths.

Probe sought in
fatal shooting of
mosque leader
Political and civil rights
activists are renewing their call
for an independent investiga-
tion into the fatal shooting of
a mosque leader during an FBI
raid.
About 200 people gath-
ered Saturday for a town hall
meeting at New Bethel Baptist
Church in Detroitto discuss the
October death of Imam Luq-
man Ameen Abdullah.
He was shot at least 21 times
during a raid on a Dearborn
warehouse by FBI agents who
said they were investigating
Abdullah and several other
men in connection with a theft
operation.
Abdullah's supporters say it
was an act of police brutality
aimed at a black Muslim.
One of Abdullah's sons says

U.S. officials:
Relationship with
Israel still strong
Top advisers to President
Barack Obama say the rela-
tionship between the U.S. and
Israel remains strong despite
sometimes blunt talk and dis-
agreements between the two
' countries.
David Axelrod tells CNN's
"State of the Union" that Isra-
el is a close and valued friend
of the United States. He says
there's an unshakable bond but
that sometimes blunt talk is
part of friendship.
Axelrod says the peace pro-
cess is essential to Israel's secu-
rity and the administration is
doing all it can to move that
process forward.
Meanwhile, senior Obama
adviser Valerie Jarrett tells
ABC's "This Week" that friends
like Israel and the United States
can disagree without incur-
ring damage. She says what's
important is to be able to have
frank conversations and move
forward.
MONTERREY, Mexico
More than 7,000
protest Mexican
crime wave
More than 7,000 people
have gathered in the northern
Mexico city of Monterrey to
protest a wave of violence that
has affected the country's third
largest city in recent weeks.
Most of the protesters wore
white at a rally in Monterrey's
main park and some released
white balloons and a white
dove as signs of peace.
Nuevo Leon state Gov.
Rodrigo Medina led the pro-
testers on a brief walk through
Fundidora Park. His border

state has seen a surge in vio-
lence that authorities blame
on a turf war between the Gulf
drug cartel and the Zetas, the
cartel's former hit men.
Hours before the rally yes-

ian were wounded in a shootout
between troops and gunmen in
Monterrey.

Protesters
demand Pope's
resignation
British protesters called on
Pope Benedict XVI to resign
yesterday as they staged a dem-
onstration over the Catholic
Church's handling of clerical
sex abuse cases.
Demonstrators gathered
outside Westminster Cathedral
to call for action over the scan-
dal, carrying placards display-
ing messages including "Pope?
Nope!" and "Don't Turn a Blind
Eye," though fewer than SO
people joined the rally.
Revelations of the sexual
abuse of children by priests
at Catholic institutions have
swept across Europe, including
in the pope's native Germany.
Benedict has been criticized
over a case dating to his tenure
as archbishop of Munich, and
his actions when head of the

visit came as a surprise to the troops, who listened as he voiced the country's continuing military support.
During tri Obama vows to
continue Afghanistan fight

Obama tells troops
that the war is
'absolutely essential'
to American security
KABUL (AP) - Under elabo-
rate secrecy, President Barack
Obama slipped into Afghanistan
yesterday near the front lines of
the increasingly bloody 8-year-
old war he is expanding and
affirmed America's commitment
to destroying al-Qaida and its
extremist allies in the land where
the 9-11 plot was hatched.
Obama's six-hour visit was con-
ducted entirely under the shroud
of nightfall, after Air Force One's
unannounced flight from the U.S.
Obama defended his decision to
escalate the fight, telling troops
whose numbers he is tripling
that their victory is imperative to
America's safety.
His bid to shore up faith in
the struggle was aimed both at
the troops who cheered him and
Americans back home. And, he
demanded accountability from
Afghan authorities to make good
on repeated promises to improve
living conditions, rein in corrup-
tion and enforce the rule of law to
prevent people from joining the
insurgency.
"Your services are absolutely
necessary, absolutely essential to
America's safety and security,"
the president told a lively crowd
of about 2,500 troops and civil-
ians at Bagram Air Field north of
Kabul. "Those folks back home
are relying on you. We can't forget
why we're here."
It was Obama's first trip as
president to Afghanistan, where
the number of U.S. troops killed
has roughly doubled in the first
three months of 2010 compared
with the same period last year
as Washington has added tens of
thousands of additional soldiers
to reverse the Taliban's momen-
tum.
"We did not choose this war,"
Obama reminded the troops,
recalling the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks and warning that al-Qaida
was still using the region to plan
terrorist strikes against the U.S.
and its allies. "We are going to
disrupt and dismantle, defeat and
destroy al-Qaida and its extremist
allies."
Obama had gone Friday after-
noon to the presidential retreat
at Camp David, Md., from which
unnoticed departures are easier
because of its secluded mountain
location. The small contingent
of White House aides and media
brought on the trip were sworn to
secrecy. Obama arrived in Kabul

just two days after a threaten-
ing new audio message from al-
Qaidaleader Osama bin Laden,
believed to be hiding along the
ungoverned border between
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"If this region slides back-
wards," Obama told the troops, "if
the Taliban retakes this country,
al-Qaida can operate with impu-
nity, then more American lives
will be at stake, the Afghan peo-
ple will lose their opportunity for
progress and prosperity and the
world will be significantly less
secure. As long as I'm your com-
mander in chief, I'm not going to
let that happen."
That resolve was meant just
as surely for stateside citizens as
for the people who heard it face
to face. Polls find that Americans
are divided on the war if, more
recently, favorable to Obama's
handling of it.
Obama's dark suit was soiled
with dust when he stepped off?
his helicopter at the presidential
palace in Kabul. White House
officials said Obama, in private
talks, wanted to drive home the
point that Afghan President
Hamid Karzai and his Cabinet
must do more to battle corrup-
tion and cronyism in govern-
ment.
Karzai "needs to be seized with
how important that is," said Jim
Jones, Obama's national security
adviser. Karzai has raised eye-
brows in Washington with recent
trips to Iran, China and Pakistan
and his welcoming Iranian Presi-
dent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to
Kabul this month.
In public remarks, Obama told
Karzai and his cabinet that he was
pleased with progress made since
their last discussion by secure
videoconference on March 15.
Obama invited him to visit Wash-
ington on May 12. He also praised
recent steps in the military cam-
paign against insurgents. But he
stressed that Afghans need to see
conditions on the ground get bet-
ter.
"Progress will continue to be
made ... but we also want to con-
tinue make-progress on the civil-
ian front," Obama said, referring
to anti-corruption efforts, good
governance and adherence to the
rule of law. "All of these things
end up resulting in an Afghani-
stan that is more prosperous and
more secure."
Karzai promised that his coun-
try "would move forward into the
future" to eventually take over
its own security, and he thanked
Obama for the American inter-
vention in his country.
He told Obama he has begun to
establish more credible national
institutions on corruption and

made clear he intends to make
ministerial appointments more
representative of the multiple
ethnic and geographic regions of
the country, according to a U.S.
account of the meeting.
The White House insisted
that Karzai's Cabinet partici-
pate in most of the meetings with
Obama.
The Cabinetmincludesa number
of ministers favored by the U.S.,
including the heads of finance,
interior and defense, whom the
Obama administration wants
to empower as a way of reduc-
ing the influence of presidential
cronies. Some talented Afghans
administrators have complained
that Karzai marginalized them
in an attempt to solidify his pow-
ers.
"We have to have the strategic
rapport with President Karzai
and his Cabinet to understand
how we are going to succeed his
year in reversing the momentum
the Taliban and the opposition
forces have been able to establish
since 2006."
The Afghan government has
tried to tackle corruption in the
past with little success but Kar-
zai pledged after fraud-marred
August elections to rein in graft
by making officials declare their
assets and giving the country's
anti-corruption watchdog more
power to go after those accused of
misusing their office. This month
he gave more powers to an anti-
corruption body, including the
authority to refer cases to court
and act as prosecutor.
Initially, the White House
said Karzai had been informed
of Obama's impending visit just
an hour before his arrival. But
Obama's press secretary, Robert
Gibbs, said later that the Afghan
government was told about the
trip on Thursday.
At least 945 members of the
U.S. military have died in Afghan-
istan, Pakistan and Uzbekistans
since the U.S. campaign started in
late 2001, according to an Associ-
ated Press count.
Obama, speaking to troops in
a cavernous tent known as the
"clam shell," said, "We know
there's going to be some difficult
days ahead, there's going to be
setbacks. We face a determined
enemy, but we also know this: the
United States of America does not
quit once it starts on something.
We will prevail, I am absolutely
confident of that."
In December, Obama ordered
30,000 additional forces into the
fight against the Taliban. Those
new U.S. troops are still arriving
and most are expected to be in
place by summer, for a full force
of roughly 100,000 U.S. troops.

At least three people
arrested in Mich,
Indiana and Ohio
ADRIAN, Mich. (AP) - The
FBI said yesterday that agents
conducted weekend raids in
Michigan, Indiana and Ohio and
arrested at least three people,
and a militia leader in Michigan
said the target of at least one of
the raids was a Christian militia
group.
Federal warrants were sealed,
but a federal law enforcement
official speaking on condition
of anonymity said some of those
arrested face gun charges and
officials are pursuing other sus-
pects.
FBI spokeswoman Sandra
Berchtold said there had been
activity in two southeast Michi-
gan counties near the Ohio state
line. She wouldn't say whether
they were tied to the raids in the
other states.
FBI spokesman Scott Wilson
in Cleveland said agents arrest-
ed two people Saturday after
raids in two towns in Ohio. A
third arrest was made in north-
east Illinois yesterday a day
after a raid took place just over
the border in northwest Indi-
ana.
George Ponce, 18, who works
at a pizzeria next door to a
home raided in Hammond, Ind.,
said he and a few co-workers
stepped outside for a break Sat-
urday night and saw a swarm of
law enforcement.
"I heard a yell, 'Get eback
inside!' and saw a squad mem-
ber pointing a rifle at us," Ponce
said. "They told us the bomb
squad was going in, sweeping
the house looking for bombs."
He said another agent was
in the bushes near the house,
and law enforcement vehicles
were "all over." He estimated
that agents took more than two
dozen guns from the house.
Michael Lackomar, a spokes-
man for the Southeast Michi-
gan Volunteer Militia, said one
of his team leaders got a frantic
phone call Saturday evening
from members of Hutaree, a
Christian militia group, who

said their property in southwest
Michigan was being raided by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives.
"They said they were under
attack by the ATF and want-
ed a place to hide," Lackomar
said. "My team leader said,
'no thanks."' The team leader
was cooperating with the FBI
yesterday, Lackomar said. He
said SMVM wasn't affiliated
with Hutaree, which states on
its Web site to be "prepared to
defend all those who belong
to Christ and save those who
aren't."
"We believe that one day, as
prophecy says, there will be an
Anti-Christ," the group's Web
site said. "Jesus wanted us to be
ready to defend ourselves using
the sword and stay alive using
equipment.
An e-mail sent to the group
by The Associated Press wasn't
returned yesterday, and phone
numbers for the group's lead-
ership were not immediately
available. Berchtold, the FlIt
spokeswoman in Michigan, said
she couldn't confirm if the raids
were connected to Hutaree.
Lackomar said none of the
raids focused on his group.
Lackomar said about eight to
10 members of Hutaree trained
with SMVM twice in the past
three years. SMVM holds
monthly training sessions
focusing on survival training
and shooting practice, Lacko-
mar said.
In Michigan, police swarmed
a rural, wooded property
around 7 p.m. Saturday outside
Adrian, about 70 miles south-
west of Detroit, said Evelyn
Reitz, who lives about a half-
mile away. She said several
police cars, with lights flashing,
were still there yesterday eve-
ning and IS to 20 officers were
stationed in the area.
Neighbor Jane Cattell said
she came home from the movies
Saturday night and a helicop-
ter was circling above, its spot-
light illuminating her house.
She and her sister, Sarah Holtz,
wouldn't say who lived in the
home but said they knew them
from riding their horses past
their house.

Russian president
cuts two time zones

President reduces
number of time zones
from eleven to nine
MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's
president thought the country
had too much time on its hands,
so yesterday he eliminated two
of its 11 time zones.
The changes mean that
Chukotka - Russia's eastern
extreme, just across the Bering
Strait from Alaska - is now nine
hours ahead of Russia's west-
ernmost area, the Kaliningrad
exclave sandwiched between
Lithuania and Poland. Formerly,
there was 10 hours' difference.
As well as eliminating the
time zone that previously cov-
ered the Chukotka and Pet-
ropavlovsk-Kamchatsky regions
in the Pacific Far East, Presi-
'dent Dmitry Medvedev ordered
that Samara and Udmurtia,
two regions in central Russia,
should be on the same time as
Moscow.
The changes went into effect

before dawn yesterday when
most of Russia switched to
daylight savings time. People
in the eliminated time zones
didn't move their clocks an hour
ahead.
Medvedev initiated the
change in his state of the nation
address last November, prompt-
ing some criticism that he was
addressing marginal issues at
the expense of the country's
array of problems.
But Medvedev said the
changd would help some far-
flung regions have more effi-
cient communications with the
central authorities, ease travel
and even improve the country's
international position.
"It's possible that this could
also aid the strengthening of
Russia's position as a link in
the global information infra-
structure," he said at a meeting
this month with ministers and
regional leaders.
But some people in the affect-
ed regions believe Medvedev
should have been doing some-
thing else with his time.

Stimulate blight control
Efforts to revitalize Detroit need federal support

I

mJ

.. .

I

A s Detroit's problems continue to grow each year, the task
of finding solutions to those problems seems more and
more daunting - perhaps even impossible. There are no
easy solutions to these problems, but a new project to demolish
blighted property and rezone the city seems particularly promis-
ing. At his State of the City address on Tuesday, Detroit Mayor
Dave Bing announced a plan to demolish 3,000 of the city's dilap-
idated and abandoned buildings by the end of the year. The plan
would benefit Detroit's economy and solidify the city's communi-
ties, and it should be enacted with the full support of the city and
federal governments.

Constitutional conundrum

0

During his annual State of the City
address last week, Bing stated that the city
plans to demolish 10,000 buildings by 2014.
The current plan is being funded by federal
stimulus dollars. Additionally, the admin-
istration is scheduled to release a map on
Apr. 1 that will identify the addresses of
the buildings that will be demolished. Bing
has also met with President Barack Obama
in an effort to secure more money and to
bring him to Detroit to bring public atten-
tion to the city's problems.
Detroit's problems are varied - political
corruption, city debt and a school district
in crisis - and a new urban plan isn't going
to solve all of them. But it's obvious that
the city needs to get rid of the blight. Much
of Detroit's vacant land is city-owned and
these investments aren't seeing any return
for the city. With increasing unemploy-
ment, migration out of the city and a tight
budget, the city can't afford to continue to
fund vacant lots.
The plan would have a wealth of positive
effects for the city. Abandoned buildings
drive down property values of neighboring
land. Removal of these properties would
pave the way for redevelopment of unused
land, which would greatly benefit Detroit's
economy. And rezoning the city into dens-

er communities would allow the city to
distribute its funds more effectively.
So it's encouraging that the funding
for the demolition project has come from
the federal stimulus. Michigan has been
hit especially hard by the recession and
Detroit has seen the worst of the devasta-
tion - it's a prime candidate for stimulus
funds. Since the city's finances are already
a mess, the federal funds are essential
to getting the project underway. And if
the project is successful, hopefully it will
encourage further federal support in the
future.
Detroit should be a top concern for the
federal government. A White House offi-
cial has indicated that Obama would like
to make a visit to Detroit, but that noth-
ing has yet been scheduled. If the presi-
dent visited and supported the demolition
plans, it could bring necessary awareness
to the city's condition. He should arrange a
trip to the city as soon as possible.
Removing the blight from Detroit could
be the first step in revitalizing the city by
redistributing city spending more wisely
and encouraging the growth of new busi-
nesses. The city should implement the plan
quickly and the federal government should
give Detroit the aid it needs.

Health care is kind of a touchy
subject these days.
Even as Democrats in Con-
gress lean at the
goal line, ready to
enact the bill that
has dominated,
all debate for the
better part of two '
years, Republi-
cans have still not
given up. Whilei
many Republi- "
can lawmakers IMRAN
have threatened to
repeal the legisla- SYED
tion - just as soon . _
as they take back
both houses in November - a more
interesting challenge has arisen in the
here and now.
As The New York Times reported
Saturday, the attorneys general of at
least 13 states have filed or joined suits
challenging in federal court the con-
stitutionality of Congress's health care
bill. It's nothing new for attorneys gen-
eral to file suit or intervene on behalf of
their states to challenge a federal law
when they deem such a challenge valid
and in the best interest of the people
of the state. But the situation can get
quite complicated when politics enter
the equation.
And that's exactly what we have
here in Michigan. Republican Attorney
General Mike Cox has joined the chal-
lenge of the health care bill in federal
court - over the vehement objections
of Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm, who has in turn offered to join
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in
defendingthe bill against the challenge
by the states.
The standoff between the Repub-
lican attorney general and the Demo-
cratic governor is awkward to say the
least. However, both elected officers

apparently have the authority under
the Michigan Constitution of 1963 to
act as they have chosen. The attorney
general is the legal representative of
the executive branch, but the state con-
stitution does notsubject the actions of
that office to the governor's approval.
And the governor, as the chief execu-
tive of the state, is certainly not bound
by the actions of the attorney general.
As it stands, the resources of the
state of Michigan could flow to both
sides of the lawsuit. In fact, that is the
only solution if neither the attorney
general nor the governor backs down.
And what a wonderfully disastrous
waste of resources that would be for a
state that has teetered on the brink of
economic oblivion for the better part
of the decade.
Naturally, Cox's challenge is not
really about the law or the people
as much as it is about politics. Given
that the health care bill is all anyone
has talked about for the better part
of the past two years, fighting it is a
golden ticket for Cox, who is seeking
the Republican nomination for the
gubernatorial election later this year.
Challenging the evil Obama health
care bill in court is going to be quite
a notch on the belt in the Republican
primary - and polls show Cox will
need it.
It's true, as Cox's people have point-
ed out, that Granholm's stance is about
politics too, as she's a strong candi-
date for an appointment to the federal
bench or to Obama's cabinet. But this
is not nearly a fair comparison. While
both Cox and Granholm may have
political motivations, Cox's stance is
simply wrong - and his stubbornness
is therefore an inexcusable disservice
to Michigan.
The challenge Cox joined on behalf
of the people of this state alleges that
the president and Congress have over-

stepped their constitutional authori-
ties in passingthe health care bill. That
claim is very, very wrong. Cox - an
alumnus of the University's distin-
guished Law School - certainly knows
how wrong it is. He knows federal
courts have routinely approved Con-
gress's exercise of its Article I power
in situationsjust like this. The question
isn't really even open to debate any-
more. Even the current U.S. Supreme
Court would throw out this challenge
to Congress's authority as meritless -
with a vitriolic, wandering dissent by
Justice Clarence Thomas, of course.
Legal challenges to
health care reform
bill are absurd.
Regardless of whether you support
the health care bill, it's absurd to claim
that its passage constitutes an uncon-
stitutional act by Congress. There was
plenty of debate over the bill, and it
passed. If we, as citizens, hate the bill,
then we can elect new leaders who can
work to repeal it. However, there is
absolutely no ground for challenging
the bill in court. Cox knows this, but
he also knows Tea Party conservatives
love those who fight Obama, and they
know very little about such things as
Congress's Article I authority.
Ironically, in acting as he has, Cox
has proven himself unworthy of the
very trust he's askingthe people of this
state to put in him as he campaigns for
governor. At least we know that much.

COLLEGE DEMOCRATS
An imp-ortant hour


Filling in the gap

On Saturday, hundreds of millions of peo-
ple around the world made a bold statement
about climate change by doing something they
do every day: turning off their lights. Since
it began as a relatively small experiment in
Sydney, Australia, organized by the World
Wildlife Foundation, Earth Hour has evolved
into a massive worldwide event in which citi-
zens around the globe turn their attentions to
climate change for 60 minutes and demand
action from their leaders. Though the concept
of Earth Hour may seem strange - after all,
how much can turning off the lights in your
house for one hour really do for the environ-
ment? - those 60 minutes of darkness made a
significant impact on our planet.
Last year, Earth Hour produced dramatic
and direct results. In Chicago alone, Earth
Hour saved 100-megawatt hours of electricity,
according to the WWF. This reduction pre-
vented over 150,000 pounds of carbon dioxide
from being emitted into the atmosphere. With
similar results across the globe, imagine how
much energy was saved this year - and how
much less carbon dioxide was released into the
atmosphere.
When national landmarks like the Empire
State Building, the Eiffel Tower and the Sydney
Opera House turn off their floodlights and high
beams, people notice. And although allowing
these landmarks to be dark for an hour saves
significant amounts of energy, something more
important is accomplished: people are remind-
ed of the gravity of the environmental issues
the world faces and become increasingly aware
of the potential for saving energy.
Earth Hour began three years ago when the
green movement was still on the fringe, strug-
gling for global attention, and climate change
was something most people had only heard
about in the context of former Vice President
Al Gore's Academy Award winning film, "An
Inconvenient Truth." Now, climate change has
become a hot button issue in Washington and is
one of the sole topics many people - regardless
of political affiliation - agree upon. Americans
are buying more efficient cars, turning down
their thermostats and doing their parts to com-
mit to more sustainable lifestyles. This is the
real benefit of Earth Hour. By asking everyone
to do something simple yet dramatic, Earth

Hour forces the public's attention to the envi-
ronment and reminds us to do our part and live
in a sustainable way.
As the world turns its attention to the envi-
ronment for one brief hour, politicians also
take notice. Earth Hour provides an accessible
outlet for the people to voice their opinions and
tell their leaders that climate change requires
immediate action. Those who participated Sat-
urday showed that people care about climate
change and demand an environmental policy
that addresses it. When close to one billion
people in over 4,000 cities worldwide make a
statement, it is difficult for political leaders to
ignore it.
This year, Earth Hour was particularly
important in America. As Americans, we can
determine whether or not the world will be able
to address climate change successfully. Now
that Congress has finished its work on health
care reform, it is time to act on climate change.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
in June that would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas
emissions by 80 percent by 2050. It is time for
the U.S. Senate to take action on the issue as
well. Many concerned citizens hope that the
next issue the Obama administration will tackle
is climate change. The people who participated
in Earth Hour sent this message to Washington
loud and clear.
It is time for America to become a leader
in environmental action for our economy, our
security and our planet. We have the technol-
ogy and the inventive capacity to avert climate
catastrophe but are lacking in political will.
America has overcome many major chal-
lenges in the past; those who are skeptical of
our country's ability to tackle climate change
apparently doubt the strength, innovation
and resolve of our nation. Earth Hour allowed
Americans to remind Congress that global cli-
mate change is the single most important issue
facing our .world today and that the debate
should be how - not whether - to address it.
We hope that our senators and representatives
have heard our voices.

Rachel Slezak, Jace Morgenstein and Tom Witkin

was walking home from the
Michigan baseball game at 5:45
p.m. last Friday when I saw the
line on the corner
of State and Pack- <
ard. After its esti-
mated opening date
had been pushed ,
back several times,
" Packard Pub was
finally set to open
at 6 p.m. that day.
And hundreds of
people, almost all COU N
male, had decided
that they needed to RATKOWIAK
be there when that
happened.
Intrigued, two of my friends and
I joined the line, which at that point
stretched all the way to Mary Street.
Once inside, we learned the Friday
drink specials weren't great and nei-
ther was the spinach-and-cheese dip.
But Ann Arbor has needed a bar on that
corner for a long time. And it's a smart
move for Packard Pub to fill that void -
with the next closest bar blocks away,
Packard Pub will probably develop a
base of loyal customers who live down
the street and don't want to walk to
Ashley's or Buffalo Wild Wings.
But even with the recent wave of
store openings in Ann Arbor, it feels
like nothing is unique anymore. South
University, whichused to have a pretty
eclectic mix of stores, is now overrun
with bubble tea and Asian cuisine. The
State Street area has seen an increase
in chain food stores (like Chipotle and
Panera) even when there are multiple
local restaurants in the city that serve
the same type of food (like Big Ten
Burrito and Amer's). It made me think
about what Ann Arbor really needs.
And naturally, being a business major,
I found myself conducting a mini,
impromptu focus group on what stu-
dents think is missing near campus:
The CVS Pharmacy that's been talked
aboutfor months. The idea of placing

a CVS smack in the middle of the State
Street historic district has long offend-
ed Ann Arbor traditionalists, who are
upset that the 209-211 State Street
building would need to be demolished
for the pharmacy to become a reality.
To make it worse, bringing another
national chain to State Street would
further diminish the charm and quirk-
iness of downtown Ann Arbor.
I understand all that, but the only
local pharmacy currently near cam-
pus consistently disappoints. I believe
in buying local, but I'll make the five-
minute drive to the CVS on South
Industrial St. instead of spending $10
on nail clippers at the Village Apoth-
ecary every time. The price gouging is
ridiculous. Students on a budget need
a place where they can buy sham-
poo or cosmetics without spending
as much as they would have on din-
ner. If a locally owned pharmacy can
lower its prices, it would fit with Ann
Arbor's image much more than a CVS.
But since the Village Apothecary has
already proved it can't do that, it's
time for CVS to step in.
A 24-hour diner in the South Uni-
versity area. With New York Pizza
Depot and Mitch's gone, the corner of
South Forest and South University is
now depressingly dark at night. And
when the bars close, the only late-night
options on the South U. bar strip are
burritos or pizza. What better business
to put in Mitch's old spotthan a diner?
The only 24-hour greasy spoon
within walking distance is Fleet-
wood Diner - "walking distance" is
a stretch, I know - and it's on Ash-
ley Street. Mr. Greek's on State Street
closes at 9:30 p.m. on weekend nights.
A New Jersey-style diner on South
University would be a perfect place
for students to grab a cheese omelet
and hash browns on the way to9 a.m.
class, whenever they feel like having
breakfast for dinner, or after a long
night at the UGLi or Rick's.
A party supplies store. While throw-
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

to make the decorations as over-the-

ing all the way home from Meijer with

my vision. And even though we would
have looked silly walking through

loons, we wished we had that option.

And I can't count the number of

Candidates talk law and order,
economy at Democratic forum

After law change,
University now
deciding how to
return remains

Democratic attorney
general, secretary
of state candidates
answer questions
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
The Washtenaw County Demo-
cratic Party hosted a forum yes-
terday at the Pittsfield Township.
Administration Building for Demo-
cratic candidates vying for the posi-
tions of state attorney general and
secretary of state.
The panel of candidates included
Genessee County's prosecuting
attorney David Leyton, whois vying
for the Democratic nomination for
attorney general and Mark Bern-
stein, who represented his brother
and attorney general candidate
Richard Bernstein - a Farmington
Hills attorney and University lec-
turer - who was in Los Angeles for
Passover.
Also present were Michigan sec-
retary of state candidates Janice
Winfrey, a Detroit city clerk, and
Wayne State University Law Prof.
Jocelyn Benson.
The town hall-style meeting
was open to the general public and
attendees were encouraged to ques-
tion candidates about issues impor-
tant to their respective offices.
Before the question-and-answer
session, each candidate opened with
* abriefintroduction,highlightinghis
or her achievements and why he or
she decided to run for the positions.
Benson said her lifelong career in
voting advocacy makes her a solid
candidate for secretary of state and
that her biggest effort as secretary
of state would be making sure that
all votes are accounted for on elec-
tion days.
"I'm running for secretary of
state because, like many of you, I'm
an advocate," Benson said. "I've
worked for my entire career as an
advocate for justice, as an advocate
for equality, but most importantly,
as an advocate to ensure that every
single vote counts in this county on
Election Day."
Benson said she is eager to use the
knowledge she gained while travel-
ing around the country visiting sec-
retaries of state in 36 other states in
preparation for her book, "Democra-
cy and the State Secretary of State,"
which was published this month.
"I've seen that there's a lot to be
done in Michigan to really take us
to the next level as we embrace this
new economic era that we're in,"
Benson said.
Winfrey, Benson's opponent,
noted that her work as Detroit city
clerk, in addition to her status as a
life-long Michigan resident, makes
her the best candidate for the posi-
tion. -
PACKARD PUB
From Page 1A
"We have 14 TVs and a mural that
we have prepped for three projec-
tors, so come football season, I'll
have three projectors on the wall,"
Miller said.
Miller said his pub differs from
other spots near campus because he
offers quality food, including what
Miller claims is the "best burger in
town."
"What separates me is the food for

one thing," Miller said.
LSA junior Doug Noveroske went
to the pub Saturday night, after
deciding against going on Friday
when he saw thelongline outside the
entrance. While he had heard a few
complaints from his friends about
the bar, Noveroske said he was excit-
ed to check it out.
"I had heard it was too bright and
the music was too loud, but someone
must have said something because
the lights were down and the music

goaltender Shawn Hunwick and the
RedHawks' sophomore goalie Con-
nor Knapp seemed to try to outdo
each other on save after save.
But the save Hunwick couldn't
make made the difference.
Miami (29-7-7) carried the play
0 for most of the third period with
the score dead even at 2-2. The
RedHawks watched a puck that
bounced over Hunwick's left shoul-
der clang off the post with three
minutes left in the game. Then, less
than three minutes into the first
overtime, a referee blew a play dead
for a penalty on Miami right before
freshman forward Kevin Lynch
knocked home a loose puck.
"I thought it was a goal," senior
defenseman Steve Kampfer said.

Democratic candidates for attorney general and secretary of state speak at the Pittsfield Township Administration Building yesterday.

"I grew up in this state, and I've
been here all of my life," Winfrey
said. "I attended and graduated
from Michigan schools, colleges and
universities. I am Michigan, if youu
will, and who better than one who
has invested a lifetime in the state
to lead into recovery? I know and
understand the people of this great
state."
As city clerk, Winfrey has worked
toward making Detroit one of the
first cities to provide full results of
elections before the end of election
nights - a success she said was "a
great feat in election administra-
tion."
As secretary of state, Winfrey
also said she would extend her work
toward ensuring quality election
administration.
Mark Bernstein said his brother
is qualified for the position of attor-
ney general because he has worked
extensively in the courtroomto fight
for the rights of the disadvantaged
and mentally challenged.
"What you have is a person who
has a deep-seeded belief in the
power of the law to transform this
state to protect the most vulner-
able citizens, the elderly, the young,
people who don't have a voice,"
Bernstein said. "And that's what he
wants to do. That's why he's running
for this office."
Though his brother is blind,
Bernstein said Richard Bernstein
has never "shied away from tough
battles."
"He has fought, and he has won
every time," Bernstein said.
Leyton, Bernstein's opponent,
noted that when the citizens of
Michigan go to the polls in Novem-
ber, theywillbe lookingfor someone
with experience - something he
feels that he possesses.
"They look for someone who's
battle tested, experienced and ready
to do the job, and I've done the job,"
Leyton said.
wasn't too loud," he said. " I don't
know if it's really like anything else
on campus. I live right across the
streetcpretty much, so ever sincethey
first put in the sign we've been look-
ing forward to it."
Packard Pub has 20 taps, with
18 different beers, six of which are
from local Michigan brewers. Drink
specials will be running throughout
the week and weekend, with a daily
happy hour from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
According to Miller, the weekend's
biggest seller, both on tap and by the
bottle, was Bud Light.
Despite the selection, some stu-
dents complained that the pub's
drink specials didn't really compare
to those of otherbars on campus.
"They didn't have all their beers
on tap, and their drink list was min-
iscule," LSAjunior Samantha Green-
berg said.
Because it was only the opening
weekend, Greenberg - who said she
often goes to Good Time Charley's
on the weekend - said she thinks the
pubis stillgetting organized and that
"We were all jumping up and down
on the bench. I don't know. Right
there and then you get the momen-
tum, they're down and out. And I
think we applied a lot of pressure
right after that. It's hard to lose a
game like that when you outplay a
team in overtime."
The Wolverines picked up their
intensity in the first overtime while
it seemed that Miami was playing

more timidly, as Michigan outshot
the RedHawks 20-6. But Knapp
kept Miami in the game, stopping
all of the Wolverines' shots.
And so the fight continued.
The game was scoreless for near-
ly 60 minutes after Miami knotted
the game at the beginning of the
second period. That is, until a puck
trickled under Hunwick's pads foru
the game-winning goal.
"I think this (game) hurts the
most," Kampfer said. "on a stand-

"A lot of people think a prosecu-
tor is a lock 'em up and throw away
the key kind of guy, and that is not
true in my case," Leyton said.
Leyton said he's established drug
and mental health courts in Genes-
see County as well as an attendance
court to ensure that high school stu-
dents attend school. He added that
he also runs a truancy program for
elementary students.
After they introduced them-
selves, the candidates were asked
a series of questions from the audi-
ence. Among the topics addressed
were No Reason Absentee Voting,
the Asian carp dilemma in the Great
Lakes and a proposed 2010 Michi-
gan Constitutional Convention.
Both Benson and Winfrey are
strong advocates for No Reason
Absentee Voting, which would
allow Michigan citizens to apply to
vote absentee without listing a rea-
son, as is currently required by law.
Benson said No Reason Absen-
tee Voting has been established in
30 states already and that, in order
to get it passed in Michigan, it will
require a secretary of state who
works ardently to get legislation
changed.
"The difference between our
state and those 30 states that have
No Reason Absentee Voting on
the books is that those states had a
secretary of state who didn't just
support it but worked tirelessly to
advocate for it," Benson said.
Winfrey echoed Benson's senti-
ments, saying No Reason Absentee
Voting is something that is actually
a "very easy task to accomplish" and
one that won't require any changes
in law - just a difference in the way
it is administrated.
"We are absolutely ready for No
Reason Absentee Voting in Michi-
gan," Winfrey said.
The Asian carp issue was a con-
cern to all candidates present at the
forum. They agreed that the carp
more drinks will be offered soon.
"We are really excited for Pack-
ard Pub a month from now because
it's going to be epic," Greenberg
said.
Despite the long lines, Miller said
the pub wasn't lax on security. Miller
said no one under the age of 21 will
be allowed in the bar after 9 p.m. He
added that security will confiscate
any fake ID cards.
"The first night we got six fake
IDs," Miller said. "We got a heck of
a security team here, and they have a
lot of experience."
As summer approaches, Miller
expects business to slow down a bit
as students leave campus, but based
on what he has heard from other
local business owners, he said busi-
ness shouldn't decline too much.
"It may slow down a bit, but out-
side of locals, you are going to have
out-of-towners here for the (Ann
Arbor) Art Fair," Miller said.
He added that he also expects
University Athletic Department
staffers to visit the pub during their
point of we weren't supposed to
be here, we had a great run going.
And now, our season came to a halt
fairly quickly. And it's unfortunate
it has to come like that."
Michigan scored five goals on
the CCHA Player of the Year, soph-
omore goaltender Cody Reichard,
when the teams met at Joe Louis
Arena on March 20. Sunday night,
Blasi decided to go with Knapp and

the netminder validated his coach's
decision, making 55 saves. Knapp's
counterpart, Hunwick, finished
with a career-high 32 saves.
"You're so close," Berenson said.
"If we would have gotten (to the
Frozen Four), this team was really
making believers out of everyone
that two months ago wouldn't have
u given us hope in heck of making a
Ford Field, Frozen Four appear-
ance. This would've been great.
And it was great, but it's not as

are an immense threat to the Great
Lakes ecosystem and Michigan's
economy.
Leyton said the carp are destruc-
tive to essential plants and nutrients
that are important sources of food
for other fish that live in the lakes.
"The downside to all that is the
end of the fishing industry, the
health of the lakes and ultimately,
we would lose not only our wonder-
ful fishing industry and all the jobs
associated with that, but it would
impact the tourism industry," Ley-
ton said. "It's just bad for the envi-
ronment and has to be stopped."
Another topic of discussion was
the Constitutional Convention,
which would allow Michigan citi-
zens to amend legislation included
in the currentstate constitution that
has been the same since 1963.
All the candidates, with the
exception of Leyton, were in sup-
port of the convention. Winfrey said
it would provide a chance for Michi-
gan citizens to change the laws to
better suit the times.
"I'm for it because it gives us the
opportunity to revisit some of our
laws," Winfrey said. "I think a lot
has changed in our society, and I
think it's good that we're able to take
a look at where we are today and the
relevant changes that might need to
occur."
Leyton said he feels "the timing is
not right" and that the large amount
of funding it would take to hold a
Constitutional Convention could be
better allocated to issues that are
more pressing at the moment, but
he noted that the state would still
be able to make changes by passing
new legislation.
"Michigan has a lot of issues,
many of them are resource related,
and a (Constitutional Convention)
would be very, very expensive and
would divert the funds that I think
the state needs to solve some other
criticalproblems," Leyton said.
down time.
"There's faculty down here at the
Athletic Department that have been
dying for me to get open, and I'm
sure I'll start seeing them here for
lunch," Miller said.
Ben Hammond, daytime manager
for Good Time Charley's, said he
doesn't think Packard Pub will cre-
ate too much competition for Char-
ley's or otherbars in the area.
"I think it's always good to have
competition to give people other
options," Hammond said. "But I
think they are far down enough that
it won't have an effect on the South
U. businesses."
After evaluating this weekend,
Miller said he's received great feed-
back and, other than a few small
kinks that need tobe worked out, the
sports bar is successfullyup and run-
ning.
"We are pretty well ironed out,"
he said. "(We) just (need) tobe a little
more efficient with the computers
- we are still updating our system.
People love the food."
good."
And the Wolverines went toe to
toe with the No. 1 seed in the entire
NCAA Tournament Sunday for 82
minutes. They were alucky bounce
away from dancing all the way to
Ford Field.
"It's a fine line between win-
ning (and losing)," Berenson said.
"I don't even feel like we lost. I feel
so good about our team and what

they've accomplished. ... The thing
I like about this team was that they
really came together, There was
no individual agendas. There was
no one worried about the wrong
things. Everybody was for the team.
And that had to be a great feeling
for these guys in the locker room. I
know it was for me as a coach."
A minute and 54 seconds into
the second overtime, Michigan's
season was over and the climactic
battle had finished.

away irreplaceable evidence, but
the law's the law," O'Shea said.
Those remains will be distrib-
uted to tribes across the 37 states
when the ruling takes effect on
May 14, according to the press
release.
Forrest wrote that the Univer-
sity plans to consult leaders of
various tribes as it prepares for
the transfer.
"Now that the Department
of the Interior has clarified the
rule for transferring culturally
unidentifiable human remains,
it is important that the Univer-
sity reach out to tribal leaders and
facilitate the transfer process,"
Forrest wrote.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said University officials
responsible for deciding what to
do with the remains have mixed
feelings about the new ruling.
In October, the University
formed a committee of 10 faculty
members and one graduate stu-
dent to figure out how the Univer-
sity would deal with the remains
in light of the expected change in
the law.
"There are feelings on both
sides," Fitzgerald said. "I think
the frustrating thing for every-
body involved is that there was a
clear rule to follow from the fed-
eral government, and now what's
happening is the Department of
the Interior has clarified the rules
on what to do with the remains
DANCE MARATHON
From Page 1A
students were summoned to the
dance area by a song compilation
that included "The Lion King"
theme song, "Jump on It" and
the theme song from "The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air." The med-
ley signaled the start of the line
dance - a 14-minute dance that
the students learn throughout
the marathon.
In an interview Saturday
morning, LSA freshman Joshua
Simon said the beginning chore-
ography for the line dance was
challenging.
"It was pretty difficult to pick
up, but we have 30 hours to learn
it," Simon said.
Throughout the event, stu-
dents also participated in games,
viewed performances from Uni-
versity and local dancers and
bands and interacted with their
DMUM families and co-dancers.
Several families were at the mar-
athon early Saturday, with some
parents and children joining the
dancers and playing basketball.
In an interview yesterday,
Kristina Greene, who is the
mother of one of the families
involved with Dance Marathon,
said her daughter really enjoyed
working with the students and
interacting with them at the mar-
athon. Greene said they attended
the marathon both days because
they like4l spending time with
their student supporters.
"She loves it," Greene said,
referring to her daughter. "This
has been a wonderful experi-
ence."
Business School senior Tyler
Hauck, who is external director
of Dance Marathon, said in an
interview Saturday morning that

the biggest challenge for him is
staying up for the entire event,
without the aid of any caffeine,
which participants are forbidden
from consuming. Hauck - who
has participated in DMUM the
last three years - said his trick
for staying awake is observing
and meeting the students around
him.
"I feed off the energy of the

and senior DeShawn Sims, who
will be graduating this spring,
have been Michigan's two leading
scorers for the past three years.
Harris was a prolific scorer this
year, averaging just over 18 points
per game, but ran into problems
when he was suspended for a
game for "unsportsmanlike con-
duct" in practice. He said after the

that are culturally unidentified."
Despite different opinions
about the new law, Fitzgerald said
Forrest and the committee are
"moving ahead quickly" to estab-
lish the process of how to trans-
fer the remains before the May 14
deadline.
LSA sophomore Alys Alley,
co-chair of the Native Ameri-
can Student Association, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
is thrilled that the University is
planning to return remains to
the Native American communi-
ties.
"Many of those remains that
are held by the U of M museum
of anthropology are the ancestors
of the Native American students
on campus, including myself, and
I can say confidently that we are
looking forward to the return
of our ancestor's remains to our
communities," Alley wrote.
Alley added that the controver-
sy surrounding the remains in the
last few years has caused a lot of
distress for members in the Native
American community.
"As a Native American student,
it has been hard and painful to
walk through campus knowing
that my ancestors arebeing kept in
the U of M Museum of Anthropol-
ogy," Alley wrote. "I hope to see
all of the 1,390 remains returned
to their homes so that we can
finallybegin the healing process."

Steinberg contributed to this report.
building," Hauck said.
Though the event is physically
grueling for the students, Hauck
said the exhaustion is nothing
compared to what the families
have had to endure.
"At the end of the day, it's the
families and the kids that mat-
ter," he said.
New this year was an "inspira-
tion tent," which included videos,
pictures and letters from many of
the DMUM families. If dancers
were feeling tired, they could go
in the tent for a boost of inspira-
tion.
LSA sophomore Katie
O'Donnell said in an interview
towards the end of the marathon
that interacting with her DMUM
family was the best part of the
experience.
"It's been really amazing,"
O'Donnell said. "I've really
'enjoyed getting to know the fam-
ilies and spending time with col-
lege students who are dedicated
to such a good cause."
LSA senior Jessica Brierly-
Snowden, who is community out-
reach chair for Dance Marathon,
said the selfless character of the
students participating in the
event is something that makes
the organization unique.
"The people who have stood
here for 30 hours didn't do it to
put itcon their resume," she said.
As the marathon began to
wind down late Sunday after-
noon, students were called to the
dance area once more for a final
countdown. However, instead of
running, the dancers fell to the
floor upon reaching zero, as they
were finally allowed to sit down.
Their enthusiasm mounted
once more as the number for the
final fundraising amount was
displayed on a screen and also
held up by DMUM leaders.
At the end of the event, though

he was tired, Hauck said he was
very excited about the large
amount of money raised for the
families.
"We try not to focus too much
on the final figure number, but
with a number like that, we can't
help but be proud of the fact that
our event and our year went so
well," Hauck said.
suspension that he had "learned a
great deal from this situation" and
he didn't"ever want to have it hap-
pen again."
Though Harris was a consistent
scorer, it seemed throughout the
year that the team was lacking a
third scorer after Harris and Sims.
Harris ended his year on an
impressive note. Despite los-
ing to Ohio State in the Big Ten
Tournament quarterfinals, he
almost single-handedly kept the
Wolverines in the game and put
his team up two in the closing
seconds. Buckeye junior Evan
Turner made a long 3-pointer at
the buzzer to win and end Michi-
gan's season.

"Don't tell me how to train my dragon."
A well-trained'Dragon

New animated film
combines amazing effects
with strong morals
By BEN VERDI
DailyArts Writer
"How to Train Your Dragon" is the best
film of the young year. It's exhilarating,
clever, sweet and mean-
ingful; but the only way to
truly do this film justice is
to take $10 and 100 min- Howto Train
utes and go sit in a theater Your Dragon
(3-D glasses optional, but
recommended) to experi- At Quality16
ence it yourself. and Showcase
Unlike the barbs Paramount
thrown at the grandiosity
of another 3-D blockbuster, "Avatar," those
watching "Dragon" won't feel like they're
being beaten over the head with morals
soaking in political innuendo. Nor will
they feel as though the film is hiding a poor
story behind expensive special effects.
The three-dimensional aspects of this ani-

mated feature add to the epic battle scenes
in which Vikings ride around on dragons,
sometimes laying waste to entire villages.
Yet they manage to never feel forced or
unnecessary, just cool.
"Dragon" is, by definition, a "kid movie,"
and what's refreshing is that it really is for
kids. The messages are slow to develop,
but, poignantly, they become clear: "Don't
kill. Use your intellect instead." Notice the
word choice. The message is not corny,
childish, or easily put into practice. It isn't
"Learn, don't burn," for instance. "Dragon"
appeals to the kid in you, but engages you
like a grownup.
Another refreshing aspect of this film is
that it's not just about a token "average kid,"
nor is it about a kid with some ridiculous
secret, or latent set of magical powers or
troubled home life he must overcome. The
main character is a boy named Hiccup (Jay
Baruchel, "She's Out of My League"), and his
Dragon is called Toothless. This is a movie
about normal, socially awkward children.
If "The Lion King" taught kids to go for
glory and "Kung Fu Panda" helped them
understand their responsibilities, then
"How to Train Your Dragon" is for the

other kids - the kids to whom the idea of
becoming king and overcoming some com-
ically overdone set of obstacles seems nice,
but unrealistic in terms of their own lives.
If you take anything away from watch-
ing this film, as someone old enough to be
counted as a "guardian" for little ones in
the theater, let it be this: You'll never be as
popular as the popular kids. But the real
point is you don't have to be. You're smart-
er than them.
Hiccup and Toothless are more Jane
Eyre than Luke Skywalker. They're not
handed the heads of their enemies on
sticks at the end of the movie, and they're
not past all of the things that gave them
trouble at the outset of the film. They
don't "defeat" the popular kids by even-
tually becoming even-more-popular kids.
Instead they become more aware of them-
selves and their ability to accomplish good
in the world. Why beat them when you can
have them join you?
The movie's main characters tactfully
manage to practice love, faith and true
unconditional friendship, which prove,
against an impressively crafted set of bad
guys, toobe whatmatters more than anything.

Movie-watching is a tough
passion to keep afloat when
you're a college student. Our
daily lives don't always afford us time to
sit down for a couple
hours and check out
a classic we haven't5
seen yet. At least,
that's the rationale I
like to use when con-
fronted by friends;
who disbelievingly
ask, "You haven'tw
seen' ___ '? Why ANDREW
the hell not?" LAPIN
Don't misunder-
stand me, friends.
When I reveal I haven't seen, say, "Taxi
Driver" or "Blow-Up," that's not code
for "I don't consider that movie a high
enough priority to watch." If I could, I'd
watch two or three new-to-me movies
a day until I've finally seen everything
the cinematic community has deemed
exceptional. But then I would never get
my homework done or have a social life
or do anything exceptwatch movies.
And that just doesn't seem like a worth-
while trade-off to me.
Everyone's got movie blind spots.
They're hard to just fill on a whim,
because no one ever says, "I've got three
hours to kill. Let's watch 'Metropolis."'
It's important to be cultured in the clas-
sics, but we have our immediate priori-
ties. And while all those great "1,000
Movies to See Before You Die" lists can
be our guidelines, we don't have the time
or resources to make them our gospel.
I've probably seen more stuff from
those lists than most, but I still want
to be watching more. The question is
how much more I should have in my
repertoire by certain times in my life.
I'm 20 years old, about a quarter of the
way through my expected lifespan.
Does that mean I should have already
seen 250 of the movies on that list?
And every time I watch a bad movie,
or re-watch something I've seen a bil-
lion times before, I suppose that was
one wasted opportunity to chalk up
another classic.
So what is our obligation to the clas-
sics? I'm not talking about the Bost-1980
John Hughes or Coen Brothers brand
of,"classic." I'm talking about the stuff
we actually have to make an effort to
seek out - the films thatyou won't
find listed as your friend's favorites on
Facebook. You know, great movies from
bygone eras.
This semester I thought I'd resolve
to see some of those great movies, soI
took SAC 353: Film History 1960-Pres-
ent as an elective. This would be perfect,
I thought. We'd be coveringthe New
Waves of France and Japan along with
New Hollywood and Italian Neo-real-
ism. Somewhere in that syllabus would
be my chance to finally cross Godard,

Kurosawa and Antonioni off my list, at
the very least.
Well, too bad for me. We did watch
a Godard film, but it wasn't "Breath-
less" or even "Masculin fdminin." It was
"Tout va bien," considered tobe one of
the auteur's more experimental, post-
New Wave selections, and not the most
essential viewing for someone who had
previously seen zero Godard. And the
Japanese selection wasn't a Kurosawa
flick but "The Sword of Doom," by Kiha-
chi Okamoto, which tends to existonthe
fringes of popular consciousness as far
as samurai cinema is concerned.
As far as I understand it, there are
two possible rationales for these sorts
of peculiar film selections: Either our
professor assumes us students, already
educated in the world of cinema, have
already seen the "greatest hits" of the
classics, or he wants to tease us with
selections that are not quite classics,
thereby whetting our appetites to
explore more options on our own. I
wanted to take the easy path toward
filling in a few more blanks on my film
resume by gettingto do it for a grade.
Turns out I'm going to have to exert a
little more effort than that.
To see the good
stuff, look beyond
your film class.
A clarification: I'm not tryingto bad-
mouth the movie selections for my class.
We've also had the opportunity to see
some truly amazing stuff, like a restored
print of "Apocalypse Now Redux" with
full surround sound that left me in awe
for days after. And I elected to attend
the St. Patrick's Day screening of Wong
Kar-wai's "ChungkingExpress," a film
I knew nothing about, instead of going
out to celebrate my nonexistent Irish
heritage. I was treated to a joyful, high-
energy romance of modernurban Chi-
nese 20-souiethings, a movie that I'll be
recommendingto my friends for years.
Trust me, it was the right choice.
What I learned from my Film His-
tory class is that if we're serious about
wantingto see movies, we can't sitback
and wait for someone else to show them
to us. You make your own time to see
the stuff you care about. And if I don't
get to everything before my time here is
up, maybe it's notothe end of the world.
There's an endless, ever-growing uni-
verse of great movies out there, and I'm
just one mere mortal college student.

Deschanel and M. Ward's sweet reunion

By KRISTYN ACHO
Daily Arts Writer
Zooey Deschanel's persona in
She & Him has always seemed
charmingly tragic. The guise
Deschanel
has created
through her
music is in She & Him
itself a study
in contrasts: Volume Two
At one point Merge
she's Zooey
the actress,
living up to her indie-darling
standards in music videos by
dancing in schools in brightly
colored Mary Janes, and the
next she's exposed, pouring the
depths of her soul into a heart-

breaking drawl on record. Like-
wise, She & Him's Volume Two
is a bittersweet romance filled
with tumultuous highs and
lows. It's endearingly devastat-
ing and it's seriously addicting.
The folk-pop duo, composed
of poster child for allthings
hipster Deschanel and singer-
songwriter M. Ward, is certain-
ly an odd couple in theory. But
the juxtaposition of Deschanel's
Karen Carpenter-meets-Doris
Day vocals and Ward's twangy
yet soulful guitar melodies
makes it sound like they were
made for each other.
Volume Two feels like a
reunion of old friends. The
album is a continuation of the
retro-vibing, antique sound

that made vinyl junkies fall for Although Volume Two never
the duo's folksy debut in the quite leaves its lovelorn, dusty-
first place. But there's a definite vinyl comfort zone, it's reassur-
sense of maturation embedded ing to know that some things
within. Deschanel, who general- will always stay the same.
Indeed, the record's stand-out
track "In the Sun" waxes nos-
c dtalgia for Volume One's taste of
wholesome pop perfection with
seco d e "'~ion cheery chorus: "We all get
s chCer effort. the slip sometimes everyday /
I'll just keep it to myself in the

Making the 'Dragon' dream work

By TIMOTHY RABB
DailyArts Writer
The new DreamWorks film
"How to Train Your Dragon" is
poised to be a one of the best-
received animated films of the
year. Several critics have already
alluded to its charming storyline
and characters, but more so to the
painstaking manner in which the
3-D version replicates the won-
ders of flight. "Dragon" is directed
by Chris Sanders and Dean DeB-
lois, the duo behind Disney's "Lilo
& Stitch," and the Disney studio is
the origin of the partnership from
which this concept was born.
"Chris and I met on 'Mulan,'
actually. That was our first film
together," said DeBlois in a confer-
ence call interview. "We were in
the story department. And Chris
Sanders was head of story when
I joined the team as a storyboard
artist. And then I took over as head
of story when he went to develop
a project. And that project turned
out to be 'Lilo & Stitch,' which we
wrote together and then we direct-
ed together."
Sanders has worked as a co-sto-
ry writer of such Disney classics
as "Beauty and the Beast," "Alad-
din" and "The Lion King." In con-
sideration of this, it's no surprise
that "How to Train Your Dragon,"
which won the box office last week-
end with $43 million, is shaping to
be such a critical and commercial
success. But beyond the singular
requisite of crafting a compelling
story, there's also a fascinating
aspect of Sanders's strategy that he
claims is the key to his films' popu-
larity.
"The interesting thing about
working where we do is, it's impor-
tant not to exclude an age group.
It sounds silly, but it's true - we
think pretty much exactly like our
own audience," Sanders said. "You
want the finished film to work on

heartbreak) all the while artfully main-
taining a sense of seductive mystery.
On "Lingering Still" the duo takes cues
from The Beatles' "I Want to Hold Your
Hand." Behind a kitschy Hawaiian
melody, Deschanel murmurs the lyrics
"He's never gonna know me if he doesn't
want to just shake my hand" - arefresh-
ing take on courtship in a day and age
where 25-year-olds are singing about
their own personal promiscuities.
For those who are not a member of
Deschanel fandom (though if you're
reading this, there's a decent chance
you are), her adorable pin-up-girl vibe
may just be too much loveliness to han-

dle. The delicate tear between sweet-
ness and sickness teeters on the track
"Home." Deschanel is quite aware of
her hipster-twee charm and uses it
to its fullest potential here. Between
bouncy lyrics ("You're the nicest, nic-
est boy I've ever met / I think about
you, then I think about you again and
again"), lullaby melodies and twang-
soaked riffs, it's pop perfection for the
Deschanel devotee but cuteness over-
load for every other listener.
With Volume Two, She & Him dab-
bles with fuller arrangements and
boldly embraces its classic AM pop yet
modern smoke-lounge vibe. Sure, it's
more of the same, but when the same
consists of cleverly composed, soulful,
throwback melodies sung by today's

a bad thing?

Keep your
head up,
Michigan



FORT WAYNE, Ind. -
Shawn Hunwick stood with
his back pressed up against
his net, simply hanging his
head in defeat.
The Michigan hockey team and
the junior goaltender had just lost
their NCAA Tournament regional
final to Miami (Ohio), 3-2 in dou-
ble overtime,
concluding the
Wolverines'
rollercoaster of
a season.
Looking
back at the sea-

at the hands BURN__
of the same
RedHawks and
Michigan State in early Novem-
ber, the loss to RPI in the opening
round of the GLI and finishing
seventh in the conference - and
adding up all those disappoint-
ments, you have to ask yourself
one all-encompassing question.
On March 28 at just around
11:54 p.m., when that final, decid-
ing goal made its way past Shawn
Hunwick and into the back of the
net, was this 2009-10 season a
success for the Wolverines?
And at first glance, most would
say no. How can you say the rocky
season the Wolverines struggled
through could be labeled as a suc-
cess in anyone's book?
Well, there's no doubt in my
mind that it was.
I'll be the first to admit - I
expected this team to crash and
burn after its two-game sweep
at Nebraska-Omaha in mid-
February. After his slow start this
year, I never thought junior Louie
Caporusso would have a second
half of the season that was on the
same pace with last year when he
was a finalist for the Hobey Baker.
And when junior Bryan Hogan
suffered a groin injury against
Notre Dame on Feb. 25, I readily

wrote about how Hunwick didn't
belong on any Division-I team.
But coach Red Berenson, Louie,
'Shawn and the rest of the Michi-
gan hockey team, you proved
me wrong and probably most of
the Wolverine fan base, as well.
You accomplished things no one
thought you could after the first
thirty or so games this season,
and for that, you can hold your
heads high on what was a somber
night in Fort Wayne.
You rode a walk-on, backup
goaltender for the last 10 games of
the season, winning eight of those
contests. You traveled to East
Lansing and stomped your intra-
state rival in the second round of
the CCHA Tournament, ending
any chance the Spartans had at
receiving an at-large bid to the
NCAA Tournament.
The following weekend, you
defeated - hands down - the top
team in the conference and the
country in Miami (Ohio), in con-
vincing fashion, before winning
the CCHA Tournament. Media
outlets and coaches across the
country - including Northern
Michigan's Walt Kyle and Bemidji
State's Tom Serratore - called
your team one of the hottest in
the country.
And then you found a way to
place the RedHawks on their
heels for much of last night's
game.
In the postgame conference,
Berenson, a 26-year veteran
coach, said he was the proudest
he had ever been of a Michigan
hockey team. Coach, your team
battled adversity all year, espe-
cially from the GLI and into
February. And that was definitely
something your Michigan teams
hadn't been accustomed to doing
over the course of your long
career in Ann Arbor.
But how your team handled
itself in the midst of this season

FORT WAYNE, Ind. - Late
Sunday night, the Michigan hock-
ey team's season came to an end
less than two minutes into the
second
overtime MICHIGAN 2
after MIAMI (OHIO) 3
Miami
(Ohio)'s Alden Hirschfeld beat
junior Shawn Hunwick on the
stick side for the game-winning
goal.
But in some respects, the Wol-
verines had lost the game in the
twenty minutes preceding that
point.
Michigan launched 20 shots on
Miami goalie Connor Knapp in
the first overtime period only to
see the puck kept out of the net in
a variety of ways.
Shots into the body of the goal-
ie, unlucky bounces and stellar

goaltending from Knapp eventu-
ally ended their season.
It started early in the period.
Michigan had a 15-second power
play to start the period and
couldn't convert. But that didn't
stop the Wolverines from carry-
ing the play in the first overtime.
This newfound jump was a sur-
prise to almost everyone in Allen
County War Memorial Coliseum.
The RedHawks had dominated
the second half of the second
period and the third period, but
couldn't find 'a way to put in the
clincher in the first overtime.
When Michigan came out for
the overtime, it looked like the
team that outshot Miami 11-6 in
the first period.
"We were getting better in the
overtime, which I think amazed
the players even that they start
taking the game over," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said.
As the Wolverines began to

take over the period two minutes,
into the game, freshman forward
Kevin Lynch had an opportunity
on a rebound, and this time he put
the puck in the back of the net.
But the referee blew his whis-
tle moments before Lynch got it
past Knapp. The goal that would
have lived on in Michigan lore
is now just part of a long list of
missed opportunities in the first
overtime.
"We played so well, when you
hit the cross-bar and when you're
all over the goalie, just couldn't
quite get the puck over him or
through him," Berenson said.
"Sooner or later, somebody's
going to score, but we've seen the
game enough where one team
gets the chances and the other
team goes down and scores."
Things that were working dur-
ing the Wolverines' seven-game
run through the CCHA playoffs
and the first round of the NCAA

To rnament, suddenly weren't
working anymore.
Junior forward Carl Hagelin,
who Berenson called "as a good
a player as there was on both
teams" had a breakaway midway
through the period. He pulled the
same move that worked a day ear-
lier in Michigan's blowout against
Bemidji State, cutting across the
net and sliding it five-hole.
This time, Knapp made the
save. Two minutes later, junior
Matt Rust let go of a rising wrist
shot that hit the post. It was one
of those periods for the Wolver-
ines.
"We tried to get pucks on net,
we were outhustling them, and in
that overtime, we just couldn't get
the puck in the net," Lynch said.
"We just couldn't get it in the net."

alty was called on the RedHawks

over Syracuse in the WNIT quar-
terfinal,
freshman SYRACUSE 52
guard MICHIGAN 78
Dayeesha
Hollins dove on a ball fumbled by
an Orange player.
After Hollins wrestled with a
Syracuse player and came out with
possession, she dished the ball to
freshman guard Jenny Ryan from
her back. Ryan and the Wolverines
now had a four-on-one.
Ryan passed it to sophomore
forward Carmen Reynolds, who
fed the ball to a wide-open Veron-
ica Hicks under the basket. The
junior guard drained the layup,
scoring two of her 24 points before
being fouled. She made it a 3-point
play after she cashed in on the
freebie from the charity stripe.
Hollins's ferocious fight for
the ball and Michigan's ability to
share the wealth were key to the
Wolverines' obliteration of Syra-
cuse on Sunday at Crisler Arena.
"I knew that we had to come
out with energy," Hollins said. "I
knew that with Syracuse we had to

think of conversions. It was really
easy for me to get back ondefense.
It was a fast-paced game and that's
what I'm used to."
Michigan's first points came
from Reynolds. She sunk a tri-
ple from the wing to spark what
became a 21-7 Wolverine run. She
went on to score 20 points in the
first half, and scored a career-high
26 points in Sunday's contest.
"I never have started like this,"
Reynolds said. "It is probably
because of the well devised plan
that we had off of the bat. We
knew that they were goingto come
at us in the zone and we knew how
to execute it. We just had people at
the perimeter, and we passed it in
and we passed it out."
As the first half began to dwin-
dle down, Ryan and Reynolds
made back-to-back 3-pointers
from about five feet beyond the
arc, in the same spot. Both came
with the shot clock at one second.
"I was just really surprised that
I got so many looks." Reynolds said.
"Like I said it's because of the well-
devised plan we had offensively.
When the shot clock is winding
down someone has to take it. It's
good I was able to step up."
In fact, it looked like the Wol-
verines could never be stopped.

Daily Sports Writer,
COLUMBUS - Spurred on
by the roaring Michigan con-
tingent seated above the floor of
St. John Arena, the No. 9 Michi-
gan women's gymnastics team
battled a field of seven at the Big
Ten Championships and emerged
victorious for the fourth consecu-
tive year.
In a year of inconsistency for
Michigan athletics, the squad has
been a model of stability, bringing
home the school's first Big Ten
crown of the year.
The Wolverines (10-1 Big Ten,
19-3 overall) posted a season-high
score of 196.900on Saturday, tak-
ing first place and avenging an
earlier loss to No.17 Penn State on
March 17, who accepted the silver
medal with 196.525.
Entering the final rotation
leading by less than three-tenths
of a point, all eyes fell on the
Michigan team taking its spot at
the beam - a troublesome event
for the Wolverines early this sea-
son - alongside the Nittany Lions
at the uneven bars.

"It doesn't get any better than
that,R Michigan coach Bev Plocki
said. "When you get down to it
being that close in a champion-
ship and competing side-by-side
like that, I was just really proud
that when the pressure was on,
we were able to rise to the occa-
sion like we did."
And the Wolverines impressed
on the beam, with four of the five
marks hitting at 9.900, including
a stick by senior captain Kelsey
Knutson to effectively seal the
victory.
Leading off for the Wolverines,
senior Sarah Curtis knew that if
the team could lay down the score
that they were capable of making,
it wouldn't matter how well Penn
State (8-3, 17-9) did on the bars.
"I was actually pretty nervous,
having to start off the last rota-
tion and knowing it was beam,"
Curtis said. "But I thought, 'This
is what they need me for, I have
to start this off right,' and thank-
fully that worked out well."
Curtis also hit a 9.900 routine
on beam, setting her all-around
score at 39.525, a season-high that

EN ROUTE TO FORT WAYNE,
Ind. -
ravel notes. Deep in the
heart of middle America.
Nothing but endless fields
and, well, that's about it.
Just hoping the battery in my
computer lasts long enough to find
some truck stop with a Wi-Fi con-
nection (hopefully those exist) so
I can send this
column back
before the puck
is dropped.
We decided
late last night
to make this
trip. Home-
work be ANDY
damned (sorry REID
Grandma), this
is Michigan vs.
Miami (Ohio) for a chance to play
in the national semifinals, and, per
my civic duty as a senior at the 'U,'
I'm throwing caution to the wind
and speeding to some ice rink in
Indiana.
By the time you're reading this
column, we'll all know whether my
spontaneous jaunt to the middle of
nowhere will have been worth the
trip or not. But win or lose (hope-
fully the former, but even a loss
in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament is, at this point, a
miracle, considering where this
team was three weeks ago), I can't
pass up this opportunity.
It certainly helps that my dad
volunteered to pay for this excur-
sion, but that's what college is all
about, right? Begging your parents
for money?
I fully plan on being with Mich-
igan in Detroit in two weeks, if the
Wolverines make it there, but I
just couldn't resist being a part of
the most unexpected, exciting run
in Michigan hockey history.
And, who doesn't like the
chance to yell the "Ugly Words"
chant - as Carl Hagelin put it dur-
ing his freshman year - in a for-
eign rink? And heckling Rico Blasi
is a true passion of mine.
All I know right now is this:

last night, I got home from a long,
strenuous day of work, and it
wasn't a nice, hot meal or a tall,
strong drink that helped me relax.
It was getting home just in time to
see Louie Caporusso net the Wol-
verines' second of five goals in the
first round of the NCAA hockey
Tournament.
The hockey team's little run
- by far the most exciting thing
that's happened in Michigan
sports in a long, long time - has
got me enthralled with the sport.
Screw March Madness; this is way
better.
And I know at least a small
contingent of Michigan fans agree
with me. And that's not counting
the kid in a penguin suit and the
guy with a Viking helmet that the
CBS Sports cameramen couldn't
pry their lenses away from during
the Bemidji State game. Saturday
night, I yelled many a "Go Blue" to
bar-hoppers along South Univer-
sity Ave. who were sporting Michi-
gan hockey jerseys (or sweaters,
whatever).
That's just not Michigan appar-
el that you see very often, unless
you're at Yost for a game. It's great
to see people getting swept up in
hockey fever.
Full disclosure: I'm not a huge
hockey fan. Somewhere, though
I grew up around the sport, I
never developed that Midwestern
appreciation for the game. But, in
complete honesty, I've only been
this excited for a sporting event
in my four years as a student very
few times.
All of the drama of the lacklus-
ter regular season and the CCHA
Tournament run and Red Beren-
son's ever-growing legacy just has
me totally geeked for this game.
Let's just hope, when stacks of
this paper hit Angell Hall tomor-
row morning, we'll all still have
some hockey to look forward to.

To kick off Big Ten Conference
play, the third-ranked Wolverines
beat No.20 Illinois in a decisive 7-1
contest at home on Saturday. Sun-
day's game was cancelled due to
weather, so Michigan enters next
weekend's contest against Wis-
consin with an unblemished Big
Ten record.
Illinois's roster promised an
explosive offense - three hitters
batting over .400 - but starting
pitcher Jordan Taylor proved she
was up to the challenge. The junior
hurler fanned 11 Fighting Illini
batters through seven innings of
work, while walking just one.
Taylor had both command and
control of all her pitches on Sat-
urday, holding Illinois to just one
earned run on five hits. The Wol-
verines used their one-pitch, one-
play focus to stop the Fighting
Illini from rallying back.
"Our philosophy is we just
throw our pitch," Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins said. "I believe our
best pitch can beat most hitters.
Good hitting teams like (Illinois)
are going to get some hits and get

some runs, but we need to hold home runs so far.

put the game out of reach.
"It's big to get on the board

team is capable of that. So, you

After spending the first month
of the season on the road, the
Wolverines will enjoy their week
at home before taking on Wiscon-
sin at Alumni Field next weekend.
The win over Illinois gives the
Wolverines mompentum heading
into next weekend's conference
matchup.
"We don't really prepare any
differently (for a conference
game)," Viefhaus said. "We have
to treat it the same as any other
game. It was very refreshing to
get (conference play) started
and come out together like that;
everyone did really well. It was
very refreshing to beat them like
we did. It shows that we can beat
anybody. Hutch teaches us to play
one-pitch softball, and that's what
we do."

Michigan blows out Big Ten opponents

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's tennis team
had a near-perfect weekend against
Iowa and Minnesota.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines
(3-0 Big Ten, 13-3 overall) first took
on No. 18 Iowa (0-2, 10-3) Saturday
afternoon, defeating the Hawkeyes
6-1, the team's sixth victory this
season against a top-25 team. On
Sunday, the Wolverines expanded
their winning streak to seven after
they swept Minnesota (2-1, 9-7) 7-0.
Against Iowa, Michigan swept
all three doubles matches for the
fifth time this season, with juniors
Whitney Taney and Rika Tatsuno
defeating the 23rd-ranked duo
Sonja Molnar and Merel Beelen 8-2
at No.1 doubles to clinch the point.

"Iowa is a really solid team and
they came in pretty confident too,"
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein
said. "It definitely helps us to get a
6-1 over a team as good as them."
On Saturday, Taney, the team's
captain, won her sixth dual match
in a row - her twelfth of the sea-
son - moving up to No. 2 singles for
the first time this season. She had
a come from behind win against
Lynne Poggensee-Wei 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.
Taney was one of the three Wol-
verines to clinch their match after
having to go into a third set.
"We won three out of four third
sets and a couple of them were 6-0,"
Bernstein said. "It shows we're
competing hard, and I think that's
what this team does."
Michigan won all the singles
matches, except at No. 5, giving the

Wolverines their sixth win in a row
against Iowa.
"Obviously taking wins is what
we want," Taney said. "We use it
as momentum going into our next
matches."
The team's second match this
weekend, played against Minneso-
ta on Sunday, was especially impor-
tant to Taney, who is originally
from outside Minneapolis.
"It's really fun (to returnhome),"
Taney said. "I'll have friends and
family there and I've played on
these courts so it's definitely great
to be back in Minnesota."
With her friends and family in
attendance, Taney earned her sec-
ond win at No. 2 singles, defeating
Tijana Kaprivica 6-2, 6-2.
Freshman Mimi Nguyen won
her fourteenth match this season,

and her eighth in a row, earning the
first singles point for the Wolver-
ines at No. 4. Senior Tania Mahtani
clinched the match for Michigan
at No. 5, deafeating Jackie Sperling
6-0,6-4.
After this weekend, Bernstein
is now 21-2 against Big Ten oppo-
nents. The only team she's been
unable to beat is Northwestern -
the dominant program in the con-
ference which has won the last 11
Big Ten Championships.
The Wolverines look to end that
as they travel to Combe Tennis
Center to play No. 2 Northwestern
this Saturday. Despite the team's
recentsuccess, Michigan is not tak-
ing anything for granted.
"Nobody takes it easy," Bern-
stein said. "And that's expected of
everyone on the team."

It took a comeback and a little

For the Daily
Riding the confidence from pre-
vious tournaments, everyoneon the
Michigan men'sgolfteam expected
a strong finish in Boca Raton at the
Florida Atlantic University Spring
Break Championship.
The Wolverines got exactly the
opposite.
In the tournament, Michigan
placed sixth out of 16 after main-
taining third place for the first two
rounds.
"We just closed today with a
terrible round," Michigan coach
Andrew Sapp said.
The first two rounds were far
from what was expected as well.
In the first round, sophomore Matt
Thompson shot an 81. Thompson's
quintuple bogey on the third hole
derailed a consistent start to the
round.
In the second round,junior Lion
Rim had five birdies and a great

opportunity to bring the Wolver-
ines closer to the scores posted by
Illinois. Unfortunately for Michi-
gan, two double bogeys down land-
ed him a final score of 68 and the
Wolverines trailed far behind the
Fighting Illini.
Playing in the final group on
the last day, the Wolverines suc-
cumbed to the pressure and post-
ed a.nine-over round that caused
them to slip down to sixth place.
None of the Wolverines posted a
score under par and the team fell
from second to sixth after a poor
final five holes.
Coach Sapp hopes this tourna-
ment helps his youngteam learnto
deal with the pressure of the final
round better.
"We just have to go out there
and do it in the final round," Sapp
said. "You just hope that you can
go out there when the pressure's
on and take advantage and thrive
under it."
Elm said players making aggres-

sive decisions down the stretch
really cost them later on. As a lead-
er on the team, Kim hopes to lead
the younger players heading into
the final tournaments of the year.
"I will make sure that I talk
with them," Kim said. "I will tell
them that in these certain situa-
tions you might want to take the
safe route rather than an aggres-
sive line."
More than that, both Sapp and
Kim agree that it comes down to
players putting too much pressure
on themselves to perform in tight
situations.
And with the Big Ten and
NCAA Championships approach-
ing, the Wolverines expect to use
the Wolfpack Intercollegiate in
two weeks to improve their play in
pressure situations.
"Mostly I think these guys just 4
need to be relaxed," Kim said.
"(They should) not put too much
pressure on themselves to per-
form."

Tough call vexes Wolverines'

'M' runners in
m'idseason form

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily SportsEditor
FORT WAYNE, Ind. - Locked in
their most epic stalemate of the sea-
son, with one of their most bitter in-
conference rivals in Miami (Ohio)
and a Frozen Four
appearance on NOTEBOOK
the line, fresh-
man forward Kevin Lynch thought
he had stamped the Wolverines'
ticket to Detroit.
But the sound of a referee's whis-
tle silenced Michigan's best shot at
continuing their eight-game win
streak.
With 17:23 remaining in the first
overtime of last night's NCAA Mid-
west regional final, junior forward
Carl Hagelin wrapped the puck
around the net, sending it through
Miami goalie Connor Knapp's legs.
Lynch took the pass from Hagelin
and buried it past Knapp for what
looked like the goal to clinch a 3-2
victory.
"I heard the whistle but the puck
went in," Lynch said. "I don't know
why they blew the whistle in the
first place. It should've counted and
I don'tknow whyit didn't. It's just a
bad break for us."
The referee behind the net clari-
fied that play had been stopped in
order to call a highsticking penalty
on Miami's Joe Hartman.
Play would stop for a short
review after the call, but the direc-
tor of officiating, Steve Piotrowski,
insisted that Miami had touched
the puck, thus giving the referee
just cause to blow the whistle for

Junior Matt Rust failed to ca pitalize on a late scoring opportunity in ov

the impending penalty.
"That's a tough one to swallow,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson said.
"You can't win on those calls. Even
if he didn't blow the whistle, he
could have said he meant toblow the
whistle. He was so intent on calling
the penalty that they couldn't see
that the puck was loose, and we
were putting it in the net."
"I was fortunate he blew the
whistle fast," Knapp said. "I knew
he blew the whistle before the guy
shot it. If the ref can't see it, he's
going to blow the whistle."

experienced a similar fate at Munn
Ice Arena against its other CCHA
rival, Michigan State, when a ref-

Summers replied. "We wouldn't
be here without you."

Rust? What rust?
In his first meet of the outdoor
men's track and field season, Michi-
gan senior distance runner Lex
Williams was in mid-season form.
He showed no rust at all despite not
even competing during the winter.
Williams took first in the 10,000-
meter run at the Stanford Invita-
tional on Friday at 28:34:28. The
time was a career best by almost
two minutes, the second-best time
in Michigan's storied history, and
the fastest time in the nation this
year.
"Usually when you haven't had a
meet in a while you just like to get
the first one out there and see where
you're at with your training," Michi-
gan coach Fred LaPlante said.
Williams obviously didn't get
that memo.
In previous years, Williams's
time would have guaranteed him
a spot at the National Champion-
ship meet, but due to rule changes
he'll have to see if his mark holds up
throughout the season. However,
with such a fast time and the rest of
the season toimprove upon it, quali-
fying seems merely a formality.
"If you're qualifying for nation-
als there's no longer a qualifying
standard," LaPlante said. "They
divide the country in half at the
Mississippi river, and the top 48
marks of the year qualify for the
National Championships. There's
no guarantee until about two
weeks before Nationals that you've
made the meet, which is much dif-
ferent than in the past."
While Williams's scorching run
highlighted the meet, the rest of
the Wolverines also fared well.
Junior tri-captain Craig Forys
took 13th in the second section of
the 5,000-meter run with a time
of 14:17.52. Fifth-year senior Tony
Nalli and redshirt freshman Bobby
Aprill ran in the second section of
the 10,000-meter (Williams was
in the first), and they came in 27th
and 30th, respectively. Nalli ran a
career-best 30:29.29 and Aprill ran
the event for the first time as a Wol-
verine.
But, Stanford was not the only
action for the Michigan's men track

At the Rice meet, senior throw-
er Sean Pruitt stole the show with
incredible performances in all
three throwing events. Pruitt won
the 29-athlete discus field at 52.77
meters and took second place in
the shot put and hammer throw,
at 17.42 meters and 58.43 meters,
respectively. He was only a one
tenth of a meter away from the
shot put lead. His marks will cer-
tainly give him a chance to qualify
for nationals in all three events.
"There aren't many guys who
can actually do all three of those at
a nationally high level," LaPlante
said.
The rest of the field athletes for
the Wolverines were no slouches
either. Junior Robert Peddlar
came in second in the long jump
at 7.43 meters, unsurprising after
his Big Ten Championship dur-
ing the indoor season. Fresh-
man John Freenlee came in third
in the pole vault at 4.8 meters,
and freshman Simon Wenet fin-
ished sixth in the discus at 50.77
meters. Peddlar's jump was espe-
cially impressive.
"Robbert Peddlar had a lifetime
best," LaPlante said. "Usually the
first meet of the year you don't start
off with a lifetime best, so that's a
great sign. He came out firing pret-
ty well."
LaPlante has high hopes for his
athletes, especially Pruitt and Ped-
dlar.
"We wantto have our guys ready
at the Big Ten Championships and
perform well there," LaPlante
said. "We hope they qualify for
the National Championships and if
they get there, become All-Ameri-
cans. Certainly for those two guys,
that would be their goals."
The sprinters and hurdlers also
had success. Junior Carl Bucha-
non took seventh in the 100-meter
and 400-meter hurdles, as well as
running on the sixth place 4x400-
meter relay squad. Sophomore
Aaron Taylor came in 12th in the
100-meter dash, and junior David
St. Amant took eleventh in the 400.
The lone distance runner at the
meet, sophomore Nick Thomas,
finished in ninth in the 1,500-meter
The Wolverines will return to
the track next weekend at the Duke
Invitational in Durham, N.C. The
meet starts Friday afternoon and
ends on Saturday.

COLUMBUS- Michigan swim-
ming and diving assistant coach
Josh White jumped in the air and
threw his hands to his forehead in
disbelief.
After watching the final prelimi-
nary heat of the 400-yard freestyle
relay at the NCAA Men's Swim-
ming and Diving Championships,
the Wolverines' relay team sat in
ninth place. Yes, that meant Michi-
gan would be the top seed in the
consolation finals, but for the third
time in the four relay events with
preliminary races, Michigan fin-
ished just one spot away from the
championship finals.
It was just that kind of meet for
Michigan. Overall, the Wolverines
missed qualifying for either the
consolation finals or the champion-
ship finals by one or two places in
eight of the 18 swimming events.
But despite some missed oppor-
tunities, the Wolverines finished
seventh in the final team stand-
ings for the second year in a row,
with 204 points. It was Michigan's
10th consecutive finish in the top
10. Texas won the meet for the 10th
time with 500 points and California

finished second.
"I'm proud of these guys,"
Michigan coach Mike Bottom said.
"Because the lesson learned is not
that they are going to get knocked
down, but the lesson they learned is
that they can get back up and they
can fight again."
And they did.
Junior Tyler Clary defended his
national title in the 400-yard indi-
vidual medley with a dominating
performance and a time of 3:38.89.
He was also national runner-up
in the 200-yard backstroke and
touched fifth in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley.
Senior co-captain Andr6 Schultz
finished second in his heat of the
200-yard backstroke, good for lOth
overall, finished sixth in the 200-
yard individual medley and placed
seventh in the 400-yard individual
medley.
Sophomore Dan Madwed had
the county's fifth best time in the
200-yard butterfly, the sixth best
time in the 500-yard freestyle and
finished 10th in the 200-yard free-
style.
From the start of the meet,
which was delayed 24 hours due
to illnesses striking three of the
teams, the Wolverines faced sev-

eral strange occurrences that could
have derailed them. In fact, another
lesson learned may have been to
expect the unexpected.
On the first individual event of
the three-day meet - the 500-yard
freestyle - freshman Hassaan
Abdel-Khalik broke his hand when
he smashed it into the wall on the
finish. He posted the second fast-
est overall time in the prelims, but
swam in the finals with a soft cast
that limited his movement and kept
him from diving in at the start.
After that race, Abdel-Khalik did
not compete again.
And then there was senior co-
captain Chris Brady, who had to
scratch from the 400-yard freestyle
relay after experiencing an irregu-
lar heartbeat that eventually hos-
pitalized him shortly following his
preliminary race. Though he has no
history of a heart condition, he first
felt the same symptoms at the Big
Ten Championships a month ago,
which also led to a hospital visit.
Brady was restricted to watching
from the pool deck as his own heat
in the 100-yard freestyle earned
spots in the championship finals.
"He has been a strong individual
and our captain throughout it all,"
Bottom said. "When he was injured

the team felt it you could see that in
their confidence and their face, so
we had to find a way to pick it up."
After Brady scratched from the
400-yard freestyle relay, Clary,
Madwed and junior Neal Kennedy
were joined by freshman Roman
Willets who made his NCAA debut
in the consolation finals of the last
event of the meet. The decision to
go with Willets was meant to give
the underclassman experience in a
championship meet.
"We've done a good job in spite
of all the things that happened
to us, because there were some
amazing things that happened,"
Bottom said. "I think it was a great
meet for learning and we got a lot
of lessons and we still achieved the
place I thought we did well with."
BERGERE RESIGNS: After
eight years as Michigan men's
and women's diving coach, Chris
Bergere resigned last Friday. He
did not give a reason for leaving
his position. Diving has become
a weakness in the last few years
for the Wolverines. Michigan was
unable to score any points in div-
ing at the Big Ten Championships
last month and has not qualified
a diver for the NCAA Champion-
ships in six years.

Blue bests Big Ten foes, moves to 3-0 in conference

By BRIAN MECHANICK and
ANDREW HADDAD
Daily Sports Writers
Last season, the Michigan men's
tennis team opened its Big Ten
season by losing back-to-back road
matches at Minnesota and Iowa,
settingthe stage for adisappointing
fourth-place finish in the confer-
ence. This weekend, the Wolver-
ines faced both teams back-to-back
again, but this time in Ann Arbor. It
seemed like the tables were turned,
especially after Michigan won both
matches.
"It was a good weekend for us
overall," Michigan coach Bruce
Berque said. "It was important for
us to be ready and show eagerness,
energy and aggression. I felt we
showed all of those things out on
the court today."
The 28th-ranked Wolverines
defeated the Golden Gophers 5-2
and the Hawkeyes 6-1.
Yesterday against Iowa, the Wol-
verines (3-0 Big Ten, 7-7 overall)
took care of business early, win-

ning the first five matches to clinch
victory. At No. 1 and 2 singles,
freshman Evan King and junior
Jason Jung both won in straight
sets. Senior captain George Navas
had one of the most dominant per-
formances of the day, winning 6-4,
6-1.
"George really impressed me
today," Berque said. "He's our
captain and I thought he showed
a lot of leadership today on the
court and also got two really good
results."
Mike Sroczynski won the hard-
est-fought victory of the day in No.
3 singles. He won the first set in a
tiebreaker, dropped the second set
and won the third. The final score
was a dramatic 12-10 tiebreaker.
"I thought I started out pretty
well," Sroczynski said. "I had a
bit of a mental lapse in the first set
and lost my focus for a little bit. I
didn't stick to my plan completely.
I've got to give the other guy credit
in the second set. He played very
well. And then that third set is
always a dogfight. I was lucky to

come out with a win today."
On Saturday, the team took on
Minnesota for the tennis version
of the Little Brown Jug. The Wol-
verines defeated the No. 39 Golden
Gophers 5-2 at the Varsity Tennis
Center, bringing the Jug back to
Ann Arbor.
The day got off to a tight start
in doubles, as Minnesota took the
No. 3 match. The No. 1 doubles
team of seniors George Navas and
Mike Sroczynski couldn't put away
two match points, but came back
strongto take the tiebreaker.
The No. 2 pair of Jason Jung
and Evan King fell behind in their
match early 4-1, but came back
strong and take the lead 7-6. King
was broken serving for the match,
but the pair stayed strong, winning
in a tiebreak and giving the Wol-
verines the first point.
Singles got off to a strong start
as freshman Chris Cha won in
straight sets at No. 6. Navas kept
the momentum going winning 6-4,
7-5 at No. 4, displaying fiery emo-
tion in the hard-fought victory.

The impact of taking back the
Little Brown Jug after losing it for
the first time in years was not lost
on Berque.
"It's definitely a good thing,"
Berque said. "The Minnesota coach
suggested ita few years back, and I
thought it was a good idea. I didn't
like walking by our trophy case
and not seeing it in there. It's good
to have it for at least another year."
The victories this weekend put
the Wolverines in a good position
as they head into the meat of their
Big Ten schedule. Next weekend
they have another home double-
header against Northwestern and
Wisconsin.
"It's early," Berque said. "But I
know our guys are excited about
competing for the Big Ten title.
We're a long way away from win-
ning any kind of championship, but
right now we're 3-0. Next week-
end we have two really good teams
coming into town, and we'd like to
continue our good start. Our focus
is on nothing more than next week-
end."

They dominated the first half in
every aspect. Michigan forced
13 turnovers and shot 56 percent
from behind the arc. And the Wol-
verines outrebounded the orange
16-11.
Syracuse just couldn't climb
out of the massive deficit in the
second half.
The Wolverines' shooting
cooled down but they still seemed
to score every time that the
Orange rallied.
"I told the kids that it will take
the last 10 minutes to win this
game," Michigan coach Kevin

Borseth said.
The Wolverines really did put
those last 10 minutes together.
They finished by taking out their
five starters, somethingthat is not
expected nor likely in a WNIT
quarterfinal matchup.
The Wolverines advance to
the WNIT semifinal where they
will play Miami on Wednesday at
Crisler Arena.
This is Michigan's first time
playing five games at home in the
WNIT.
As Hicks left the press confer-
ence she tilted her head back and
looked up. "Thank you lord," she
screamed. "Final four."

The Michigan women's basket-
ball team has played the first four
rounds of the Women's National
Invitation Tour-
nament (WNIT) NOTEBOOK
at home this year.
And outside the team's game
against Toledo last weekend - for
which Rocket fans noticeably out-
numbered Michigan fans - play-
ing in the confines of Crisler Arena
has been a large part of the Wolver-
ines' success.
Michigan has won by an average
of more than 24 points per game
- the latest being a 26-point win
Sunday over Syracuse.
"In this tournament (home
court advantage) is big," Syracuse
coach Quentin Hillsman said. "I
don't know how much home court
had to do with the way we per-
formed today, but I think it had a
lot to do with the way Michigan
performed. They were home, they
were comfortable."
The Wolverines play at home
again in the final four of the WNIT
on Wednesday against Miami.
The Hurricanes made their first
road trip yesterday in the postsea-
son, defeating Providence 73-65.
The host site is determined by a
combination of factors, including
attendance and crowd atmosphere.
And being chosen yet again is
undoubtedly a major boost for the
Wolverines.
"Crowds are everything for us,"
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
said after the game. "From our per-
spective, I hope we're building a
fanbase because that's really what
this is, postseason play."
With yesterday's crowd the best
it has been possibly all season, the
team hopes that as it gets even
deeper into the tournament that
the excitement surrounding the
program will grow proportion-
ately.
"I'm hoping Wednesday we can
really lure a lot people out here,"
Borseth said. "It's going to be a
great night obviously, because
there'll be not alot on TV, not a lot
going on. It's a Wednesday, should
be a great day for basketball to fill
Crisler. I think our record is 5,500,
I think we can get 13 grand. I would
love to see that."
The Wolverines set the record

Junior Veronica Hicks finished the afternoon with a career-high 24 points. The junior was a force on defense with tour steals
and helped the Wolverines give Syracuse its first non-conference loss this season. Michigan advances to the WNIT semifinals,

for attendance this year against

UP-TEMPO SUCCESS: Michigan
has had the most success offen-
sively throughout the season when
it can get out in the open court and
run.
Against a very long and athletic
Syracuse team, the Wolverines
converted 23 Orange turnovers
into 24 points.
"I think we prefer to play at a
quicker pace, that's what we're bet-
ter at," Borseth said. "We had some
nice breaks, nice breakouts and
got some transition baskets. But
I think for the most part we were
very smart, I guess. We made good

decisions in transition."
The team's ability in the open
court is a big factor behind its aver-
age of 71 points per game in the
WNIT - up about 10 points per
game from the conference season.
On Wednesday, Michigan may
be faced with similar opportuni-
ties in the open court, when they
take on Miami.
"They like to press," Borseth
said of the Hurricanes. "They're
very pressing, up-tempo, in your
face. They press. They come and
get you."
MAKING HISTORY, LEADING

When the Redbirds defeated
Illinois on Sunday, Michigan was

some hardware regardless."
Beilstein posted a pair of 9.900
scores on the floor routine and the

the vault, taking first out of 42 ath-
letes.
"Coming out on the floor I want-
ed to go big, I wanted to go hard,
and that's what I did," Beilstein
said. "On vault I knew to get that
good score you had to stick it, and
that's what I went out there and
did."
Now secured among the nation's
best programs, everything will
come down to execution as the
team gears up for the NCAA
Regional finals in two weeks.
"We don't really have that much
to work on," Curtis said. "We
can always work on the little tiny
things that need to be fixed, but
after this meet and going to region-
als we just want to carry on what
we've been doing all year and make

Freshman Natalie Beilstein was named to the Big Ten second team, and was a
finalist for the Big Ten Freshman of the Year Award.

Oaks dominates opening-day start

By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
Senior pitcher Alan Oaks threw
the first pitch of the year at the Ray
Fisher Stadium on Friday after-
noon as the Michigan baseball team
kicked off its home opener in Ann
Arbor. But Oaks wasn't the only
one who kept Indiana University
- Purdue University Fort Wayne
swinging.
Michigan (12-9) swept the
three-game series with help from
its pitching staff. A total of 10
Wolverines took the mound over
the course of the weekend. Oaks
earned the 10-2 decision on Fri-
day, pitching five innings and
striking out five batters. Although
he threw a strong 83 pitches, Oaks
wasn't as sharp as he has been,
allowing both Mastodon runs.
"When you leave the ball up in
the zone, anyone can hit it," Oaks
said. "And to give them credit, I
missed a couple spots and they put
good swings on it and got hits."
But IPFW couldn't defend
against the powerful Michigan
bats. Back-to-back doubles by
senior first baseman Mike Dufek
and senior outfielder Nick Urban
gave the Wolverines a 2-0 lead

in the second inning. Sophomore
third baseman John Lorenz then
pushed Urban across home plate
with a single.
Sophomore designated hitter
Coley Crank answered an IPFW
run in the top of the third by
launching a two-run homer - his
sixth of the season and the first
home run at home. Crank also
extended his career-best hitting
streak to eight games.
Michigan piled up the runs dur-
ing the fourth and fifth innings to
extend its lead to eight. Crank,
Dufek, and senior catcher Chris
Berset tallied a combined seven
RBIs and four runs.
"You've just got to stay with
your approach, just looking for
good pitches to hit," Berset said.
"Luckily, I found some holes on
some of them and hit a few balls."
The hitting saga continued into
Saturday as the Wolverines took
8-0 and 12-3 wins in their dou-
ble-header. Freshman outfielder
Patrick Biondi led the Michigan
batters in game one by hitting a
triple in the first inning. The oth-
ers followed with four singles and
a double by Berset to give the Wol-
verines a 4-0 advantage.
"I obviously had goals for

myself," Biondi said. "First and
foremost, it was getting on base
and setting the table for some of
our bigger hitters. But I've been
fortunate to hit some balls hard
and get good results and hopefully
I'll stay to the plan and it'll keep
happening."
A home run by Lorenz in the
fpurth inning blew the game open,
giving Michigan an eight-run
lead. Redshirt sophomore pitcher
Bobby Brosnahan led the Wolver-
ines on the mound by striking out
a career-high eight batters while
holding the Mastodons scoreless.
Junior pitchers Tyler Burgoon
and Kolby Wood both came in
for relief, striking out five batters
each in order to secure the shut-
out.
The final game of the series
turned out to be a comeback win
for Michigan. After scoring two
runs in the first, the Wolverines
had a momentary lapse in the sec-
ond. Junior pitcher Matt Miller
struggled on the mound, hitting
a batter and giving up three runs
to the Mastodons - two of which
were home runs - giving IPFW
a 3-2 lead. Despite a shaky start,
Miller gained control and didn't
allow any more Mastodon runs.,

"As far as Miller being where
he wants to be or where we'd like
him to be at this point, obviously
that didn't occur," Maloney said.
"But I feel like that before the last
few outings he didn't have a true
out pitch and I thought he showed
it. He struck out five guys, but he
struck out three on balls to the
dirt - with hard breaking balls to
the dirt - which he hadn't been
able to earlier."
The Wolverines scored one
run each in the third and fourth
innings, giving them a 4-3 lead.
Michigan maintained its advan-
tage for the rest of the game,
extending the lead with a five-run
rally in the end of the eighth.
Michigan extended its winning
streak to a season-best six games
in a row. The Wolverines may have 4
finally found a productive combi-
nation of pitching and hitting in
the same game.
"We only gave up five runs the
whole weekend," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said. "We also only
made one error all weekend and
we had over 5 hits for the whole
weekend. That's three parts of
the puzzle I think we did pretty
well, so it was a solid weekend of
baseball."
