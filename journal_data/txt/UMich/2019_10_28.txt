The University of Michigan 
held a groundbreaking for its 
new $920-million-dollar hospital 
on Friday, featuring remarks 
from University President Mark 
Schlissel and U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Ann Arbor. Outside 
the private event, dozens of 
Michigan nurses stood holding 
signs and chanting protests such 
as “U of M you can’t hide, we can 
see your greedy side,” and “U of 
M, you’re no good, treat your 
workers like you should.” 
The nurses were protesting 
a lack of sufficient parking 
options at Michigan Medicine for 
hospital employees. Earlier this 
year, over 250 employee parking 
spaces were converted to patient-
only parking spots. This made it 
increasingly difficult for nurses 
and other hospital staff to find 
adequate parking and get to work 
on time, according to Michigan 

Medicine nurses. The nurses 
protested at the Board of Regents 
meeting on Sept. 18, but said they 
do not feel like the University 
heard their concerns. 
According 
to 
Katie 
Oppenheim, 
chair 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Professional Nurse Council, this 
parking shortage has existed at 
Michigan for decades. While 
it’s great the University keeps 
building 
new 
buildings 
and 
improving its facilities, there is a 
need for new parking structures 
too, Oppenheim said.
“They 
continue 
to 
build 
buildings — the cardiovascular 
center, which has very small 
parking lot, where only patients 
can park in any case, and then 
the Children’s and Women’s 
Hospital, which added hundreds 
of beds with no additional 
parking,” Oppenheim said. 

Democratic 
presidential 
candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders 
of Vermont talked about jobs, 
wages and economic inequality 
at a rally in Detroit on Sunday. 
More than 2,500 supporters 
gathered in the gymnasium of 
Detroit’s Cass Technical High 
School for the rally. Sanders 
was introduced by U.S. House 
Representative Rashida Tlaib, 
D-Detroit, who later endorsed 
the candidate’s campaign for 
president. 
Tlaib joined fellow freshman 
Congresswomen 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar 
in endorsing Sanders, as the two 
endorsed 
Sanders’ 
campaign 
earlier this month. 

“We deserve someone who 
writes the damn bills,” Tlaib 
said. 
“We 
deserve 
Bernie 
Sanders.”
Sanders entered the gym to 
chants of his name, hundreds 
of supporters lining the balcony 
overlooking the room. In the 
stands, a row of placards reading 
“Detroit Loves Bernie” was 
complemented by a sea of blue 
“Bernie 2020” signs.
Sanders began his address 
by reflecting on former Rep. 
John Conyers, the late U.S. 
Congressman 
representing 
much of Western Detroit who 
passed away Sunday afternoon. 
Conyers served Michigan’s 1st, 
13th and 14th congressional 
districts from 1965 to 2017, 
co-founding the Congressional 
Black Caucus and continually 

advocating 
for 
the 
nation’s 
transition 
to 
a 
single-payer 
health care system. He resigned 
during his 26th term in 2017 
following 
sexual 
harassment 
allegations.
Sanders 
said 
Conyers, 
the 
longest 
serving 
Black 
congressman 
in 
American 
history, was an unrelenting 
fighter for social justice and 
economic opportunity, someone 
who 
inspired 
Sanders’ 
own 
legislative agenda.
“Tonight we’re not here just 
to mourn John, but to celebrate 
a life of enormous achievement,” 
Sanders said. “As all of you 
know, John was a champion 
for civil rights, he was the man 
most responsible for having a 
national holiday for the great 
Martin Luther King Jr., and 

long before it was popular, 
John Conyers understood that 
healthcare is a human right.”
Sanders spent most of his 
speech explaining the main 
goals of his campaign: to combat 
the political establishment and 
expand economic opportunity 
to all of the American people. 
Sanders 
said 
he 
visited 
several 
neighborhoods 
in 
Tlaib’s 
district, 
in 
which 
voters expressed concern over 
tightening economic conditions 
for the working class. 
“Rashida took me around her 
district here in Detroit, and I 
met with beautiful young people 
who are going to schools in 
which they don’t have adequate 
textbooks,” Sanders said. 

In light of domestic violence 
awareness 
month, 
Students 
Demand 
Action 
and 
the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center hosted an 
event Friday evening to discuss 
the intersection of gun violence 
and domestic violence. 
LSA senior Taylor King, group 
co-lead of Students Demand 
Action, and Public Policy junior 
Matt Weiner, student volunteer 
and outreach chair at SAPAC, 
introduced the issue in regard to 
Michigan specifically. 
“Over one third of women in 
Michigan report experiencing 
some form of intimate partner 
violence in their lifetime; in 2017 
alone, there were over 88,000 
domestic 
violence 
incidents, 
including over 12,000 aggravated 
domestic assaults in Michigan,” 
King said.
In Michigan, people convicted 
of domestic violence are allowed 
to purchase firearms, as long 
as their victim was not a live-
in 
spouse. 
This 
“boyfriend 
loophole” would be closed with 
the passing of House Bill No. 
4497.
“HB 4497 is sitting in the 
Michigan 
State 
Judiciary 
Committee, where it has been 
since April without receiving a 
single hearing,” Weiner said.
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Ann Arbor, began the panel 
by 
discussing 
her 
personal 
experience growing up in a 
home with domestic violence 
and detailing how this violence 
affected her and her sister. She 
recalled feelings of shame when 

the police dismissed their calls 
and would not show up when 
her and her sister were worried 
about their safety and hiding in a 
closet. The first time Dingell told 
her story was on the House floor.
“I got up and gave a speech 
from my heart, that was one of 
the hardest things I ever did, but 
this is so important to me that 
women need to be safe and that 
people who shouldn’t have guns 
need to be kept from buying 
them,” Dingell said. 
Quyen Ngo, research assistant 
professor in the Department 
of 
Emergency 
Medicine, 
discussed her research, which 
focuses on understanding the 
motivations behind perpetrators 
of domestic violence. She said 
children exposed to violence 

are more likely to become 
aggressors of domestic violence 
in adulthood, and she studies 
these intergenerational issues 
to address the cycle of domestic 
violence from both sides. 
“I believe we cannot fix this 
problem unless we deal with the 
social and contextual factors 
that lead people to perpetrate 
and become aggressors,” Ngo 
said.
Jackie Jones, a survivor of 
gun violence and a member of 
Moms Demand Action, became 
an 
advocate 
for 
preventing 
gun violence when her son 
and nephew were murdered in 
Saginaw by men that grew up 
with domestic violence in the 
home. As a Black woman, she 
highlighted the misconception 

that every person killed by gun 
violence in a Black community is 
deserving in some way; she said 
her son and nephew were simply 
sitting in a car when they were 
shot. 
“I got to say something; I can 
no longer just not do anything … 
even though I was afraid, I had 
to,” Jones said.
The moderators and panelists 
advocated 
for 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act, which 
was passed in the House seven 
months ago and is awaiting 
Senate action. Ngo said this 
dialogue can be bipartisan, and 
proponents of gun policy reform 
are advocating for safety.

Local bakery Milk + Honey 
held an opening for its pop-up 
at Bløm Meadworks, an Ann 
Arbor cidery and meadery on 
S. Fourth Ave., after a month-
long soft opening. The event, 
held Saturday, featured an 
extensive menu of sweet and 
savory 
baked 
goods 
along 
with 
drink 
pairings 
from 
Bløm, flowers from Bhakti 
Flowers and pumpkins and fall 
vegetables from Slow Farm.
Milk + Honey is open on 
Fridays and Saturdays at Bløm 
with a new weekly menu. In 
addition to the baked goods, 
Milk + Honey serves loose leaf 
tea from TeaHaus and drip 
coffee from Anthology, a coffee 
shop in Detroit. The bakery 
was started two years ago by 
Rachel Liu Martindale to help 
fund a homeless ministry she 
and her husband were helping 
in downtown Ann Arbor.
“Every 
week 
we 
were 
feeding the homeless, and it 
was coming out of our own 
pocket so we were just like, 
‘Oh, we should probably have 
a different way of helping out 
with that,’” Liu Martindale 
said.

Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Jackie Jones and Quyen Ngo discuss the effects gun violence can have on society and 
how to treat victims of gun violence with respect Friday evening.

The Ann Arbor chapter of 
the 
Society 
of 
Professional 
Journalists organized a panel 
discussion titled “Scoring in 
Sports Journalism” on Friday, 
to discuss the nuances of sports 
reporting. 
The event began with a keynote 
speech by Ketra L. Armstrong, 
an award winning freelance 
sports-journalist and professor 
of sport management at the 
School of Kinesiology. Armstrong 
emphasized the need for entities 
like the SPJ, and listed the power 
of media in framing a narrative, 
the need for diverse perspectives 
and the importance of creativity 
as three things she has learned 
during her career. 
“The world needs sports,” 
she 
said. 
“But 
sports 
need 
journalists who have the ability 
and the willingness to do this 
job with civility, with dignity 
and with social responsibility. 
The 
sports 
industry 
needs 
journalists who will embrace 
their social responsibility to make 
a difference.”
Jason 
Beck, 
Tigers 
beat 
reporter for MLB.com, reflected 
on the way the nature of his job as 
a beat reporter has changed.

Bernie in Detroit

Candidate endorsed by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib


“They are going to schools 
where 
their 
teachers 
are 
forced to work two or three 
jobs just to make a living. I 
don’t think it is too much to 
ask that in the wealthiest 
country in the history of the 
world we pay our teachers a 
living salary.”
In 
her 
introduction 
of 
Sanders, 
Tlaib 
also 
touched on the struggles of 
metro 
Detroit-area 
voters, 
particularly relating to racial 
or 
wealth 
discrimination 
by 
insurance 
companies 
against 
socioeconomically 
disadvantaged voters. 
“People in our communities 
have 
overcome 
redlining, 
systemic racism only to see 
their water shut off,” Tlaib 
said. 
“Their 
homes 
taken 
away, simply because they’re 
too poor to afford shelter, 
or fell on hard times. We 
live in the Motor City, the 
region that gave the world the 
automobile, and yet many of us 

— many of us — cannot afford 
to insure the cars we drive 
because insurance companies 
are allowed to discriminate 
against us.”
Tlaib and Sanders were 
both met with resounding 
cheers and applause from an 
audience diverse in race, age 
and ethnicity, though largely 
made up of students and 
younger voters.
Likewise, the majority of 
the Bernie 2020 campaign 
volunteers — who checked 
voters in as the rally hall 
began to fill up — were young, 
many only college or high 
school students.
One of these volunteers, 
high school junior Zeinab 
Alghanem 
from 
Dearborn, 
first joined Sanders’ campaign 
via 
Students 
for 
Bernie 
over this past summer. Now 
Alghanem spends her free 
time canvassing and making 
cold calls to voters. Alghanem 
said she is confident Sanders 
will do right by working class 
families like her own. 
“Other 
candidates 
don’t 
have 
the 
same 
record,” 

Alghanem said. “Candidates 
always like to make promises 
but they never follow through 
on them. Based on his record 
we can tell that he’s going to 
follow through on them, and 
I just know that he will fight 
for us. I come from a low-
income family, so health care 
has always been an issue, and 
low wages have always been 
an issue. So I just know that 
when he gets there he’s going 
to fight for us.”
While she has been working 
for Sanders’ campaign since 
the summer, Alghanem said 
her interest in politics began 
with 
working 
for 
Tlaib’s 
campaign in 2018, along with 
others from her high school in 
Dearborn.
“Me and my advisor and two 
other students went and door 
knocked — 4,000 doors — to 
get out the American vote,” she 
said. “So I think that’s doable 
again for Bernie’s campaign.”
Another young volunteer, 
Michigan 
State 
University 
freshman 
Kristin 
Perkins, 
worked as an usher at the 
event, helping people find 
their seats before Bernie 
took the stage. Perkins said 
her student activism was 
what brought her and her 
classmates down to Detroit 
for the rally.
“I’m 
actually 
part 
of 
a 
student 
group 
called 
Spartans for Sanders down 
at Michigan State, and we 
all came up here, we saw 
the 
opportunity, 
and 
we 
decided to take it,” Perkins 
said. “We’re really passionate 
about Bernie Sanders, and 
his mission for the United 
States.”
Among these students were 
several Sanders supporters 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan. LSA sophomore 
Esau Delgado is the treasurer 
of Students for Bernie at 
U-M. Much like Alghanem, 
Delgado 
says 
Sanders’ 
economic agenda appeals to 
the economic needs of his 
own family.
“Originally 
I’m 
from 
the South Side of Chicago, 
and both of my parents 
immigrated 
here 
from 

Mexico,” Delgado said. “So 
I kind of view Bernie as this 
independent candidate that’s 
only beholden to the working 
class. One of the issues that 
I really love is tuition free 
college, 
because 
when 
I 
was growing up, my mother 
raised my sister and I single-
handedly. She works a job, 
makes less than $20,000 a year, 
and she had to worry, (with 
us) growing up, you know, 
how am I gonna pay tuition 
for my kids. Both of them. 
With tuition-free college she 
doesn’t ever have to worry 
about that. She doesn’t have to 
have that anxiety.”
Delgado 
also 
recognized 
Sanders’ ability to mobilize 
young people, explaining his 
campaign’s message resonates 
with Americans who may not 
have voted before, but who 
find common ground with 
Sanders’ social and economic 
agenda. 
“I 
feel 
like 
he’s 
really 
targeting people who have 
not been part of the political 
process 
before, 
especially 
people 
of 
color,” 
Delgado 
said. “I identify as Mexican 
American 
and 
he 
just 
motivates me to go harder 
for him, to phone bank more, 
to canvas more, to volunteer 
more. Because I truly feel like 
his policies will benefit people 
like me, people of color.”
The message of Sanders’ 
rally remained focused on 
economic 
opportunity 
and 
job creation. Ultimately, he 
left the Detroit crowd with a 
message of positivity. 
“As a Senator, I have seen the 
incredible wealth and power 
of the one percent,” Sanders 
said. “Be clear — they have 
unlimited amounts of money. 
Health 
care 
industry 
will 
spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars trying to stop Medicare 
for all. The fossil fuel industry 
will spend as much as it 
takes trying to preserve their 
profits. The prison industrial 
complex, military industrial 
complex, 
incredible 
wealth 
and incredible power. But at 
the end of the day, the one 
percent is one percent.”

SANDERS
From Page 1A


As my 3-hour seminar on 
Modern Middle East history 
came to an end, a classmate 
approached 
me 
about 
some 
comments I made in class. Of 
course, nothing about that was 
inherently unusual. What made 
the encounter memorable was 
that she chose to address me in 
my native tongue, Arabic.
After fumbling with my words 
in conversation, I explained to 
her that I’m not used to speaking 
my language here. Maybe back 
in Jeddah, the city I grew up in, 
but not here in a classroom at 
an American university. Since 
I moved here four years ago, 
Arabic has been a language 
that belongs strictly within 
the confines of my household. 
In 
my 
history 
courses, 
colonialism wasn’t isti’mar, it 
was 
colonialism. 
Economics 
wasn’t iqtisad, it was economics. 
Belonging wasn’t intima’, it was 
belonging. 
University 
simply 
turned the Arabic vocabulary 
of my household into a jumble 
of 
indistinguishable 
sounds, 
replacing them instead with 
their English counterparts.
I left class that day thinking: 
what else have I buried away at 
home? What secret knowledge 

have I kept away from my day-
to-day life at the University 
of Michigan? And why have 
I unconsciously decided that 
some knowledge belongs at 
home, while other knowledge 
belongs in the classroom? I 
answered all of these daunting 
questions when I took a second 
look at what brought me to that 
seminar on Modern Middle East 
history to begin with.
I decided to study history 
at the University of Michigan 
from a desire to learn about 
myself and how I relate to the 
world around me. Three years 
ago, I did not feel confident 
talking about my own peoples’ 
history. I did not understand 
why the biggest socio-political 
occurrence of my childhood — 
the Arab Spring of 2011 — had 
occurred, much less why it had 
descended into violence in my 
homeland in Syria. I came to 
this institution in search of 
these answers — and now, I’ve 
realized that I was, only partly, 
looking in all the wrong places.
Students 
of 
color 
and 
otherwise, largely understand 
“academic” knowledge to be 
the knowledge in books -- the 
knowledge passed down to us 
by our faculty in the form of 
academic articles or textbooks. 
The 
gatekeepers 
of 
this 
knowledge are the academics 

with “mastery” over a given 
field: they’ve read every last 
piece of literature on the subject.
Subconsciously, 
I 
aspired 
to be one of those masters of 
knowledge. I wanted to know 
everything there is to know 
about my people and I thought 
the way to go about doing so was 
consuming all this literature, 
doing my homework, writing my 

essays and getting my grades. 
I’ve learned quite a great deal 
through doing so — and yet, I 
can’t seem to speak about all 
that I’ve learned in my native 
tongue, the language I dream in, 
the language I yell at reckless 
drivers in, the language I use to 
play with my 5-year-old brother.
I 
realized 
that 
I 
had 
internalized 
a 
hierarchy 
of 
knowledge: 
the 
serious 
“academic” knowledge of my 

classes, juxtaposed against my 
family traditions, the stories my 
grandparents tell me and the 
jokes my middle school friends 
and I shared in Jeddah. To my 
mind, learning about who I am 
meant unlearning the latter, and 
honing in on the former. It took 
a conversation in Arabic about 
class material for me to even 
recognize what I had done.
To be clear, I don’t believe we 
ought to uncritically accept our 
own lived experiences wholesale 
as “universal.” Rather, I want 
to invite fellow students of 
color, particularly immigrant 
students, to join me in taking 
our 
own 
lived 
experiences, 
communal 
traditions 
and 
unconscious 
knowledge 
just 
as seriously as we take what 
we read in the classroom — 
which, for the record, is not 
“universal” 
either, 
as 
much 
as it often pretends to be. My 
biggest moments of personal 
growth at the university have 
been moments in which I put 
my personal experiences in 
conversation with what I learn 
about systems of power, other 
identities and narratives that 
differ from my own.The mental 
exhaustion 
of 
struggling 
to 
speak my native tongue at the 
University is well worth the 
reward –– I am finally one step 
closer to learning who I am.

What secret 
knowledge have 
I kept away from 
my day-to-day life

Multiverses of 
liminality

The first time I encountered 
the idea of a “multiverse” — 
multiple dimensions of reality, 
of potential — was when I 
watched 
Spider-Man 
Into 
the Spiderverse (arguably the 
best Spiderman movie, don’t 
@ me). In it, Miles Morales 
is just one of many very 
different Spidermans who are 
part of different universes: 
There’s 
bitter, 
middle-aged 
Spiderman; 
there’s 
young 
Gwen, Spiderwoman; there’s 
a black-and-white Spiderman; 
an 
anime 
Spidergirl; 
and 
even Spiderpig. 
If 
you’re 
wondering why 
this article that 
is 
not 
about 
Spiderman 
is 
spending 
its 
first paragraph 
on a Spiderman 
movie, 
don’t 
worry, 
I’m 
getting there
One night, as I was trying to 
fall asleep, I had an idea for a 
writing project (my writing 
ideas always seem to come 
at the most inconvenient of 
times, most frequently while 
I’m showering or about to fall 
asleep). I kept wondering about 
my multiverse — is there a 
universe in which I didn’t quit 
Korean school after less than 
a year, and the Monica of that 
universe is fluent in Korean? 
Does that Monica also speak 
only in Korean to her parents, 
rather than Konglish? Is she 
able to hold more than a five-
minute conversation on the 
phone with her grandfather, 
who lives in South Korea?
I wanted to explore this idea 
of the multiverse, especially 
concerning liminality — of 
in-between-ness 
— 
which 
is what I’m currently doing 
with a series of bad, first draft 
poems. There’s little things, 
like how I hold my chopsticks. 
There’s a universe in which I 
was taught the “correct” way 
to hold them, a universe where 
I wasn’t taught the correct 
way but learned how to hold 
them correctly, a universe 
where I was taught correctly 
but got into the bad habit of 
holding them incorrectly, a 
universe where I’m not taught 
the correct way and can’t hold 
them correctly (which is the 
current universe we live in).
In all of these universes, 
does my cousin still question 
my ability to hold chopsticks 
the right way? Does my uncle 
still make fun of the way I 
hold them? Do I still feel bad 
about not being Korean enough 

because of something so small 
as the way I hold chopsticks?
The 
question 
of 
being 
Korean enough is something I 
started struggling with at the 
end of high school and was the 
subject of my Common App 
essay, which feels very cliche; 
but maybe there’s a universe 
in which my Common App 
essay is not about this topic. 
Even though it feels cliche, it’s 
something 
that 
immigrants 
and children of immigrants 
grapple with a lot. I am othered 
in America; I am othered in 
Korea. Not American enough, 
not Korean enough.
There was a time when 
someone calling 
me whitewashed 
wouldn’t bother 
me, when I felt 
something akin 
to pride when 
I was called a 
banana — yellow 
on the outside, 
white 
on 
the 
inside — because 
it 
meant 
that 
I was one step 
closer to whiteness in the 
predominantly white middle 
school and high school I went 
to. It meant that, maybe, I had 
a better chance of fitting in, 
of not being subject to racist 
microaggressions. It led to 
a lot of self-loathing about 
how I looked and the culture 
I came from, to the point 
where I stopped speaking in 
Korean to my parents, stopped 
wanting to partake in cultural 
events like chuseok, Korean 
Thanksgiving.
Now I feel like I’m making 
up for lost time. Maybe there’s 
a universe where I took Korean 
classes 
instead 
of 
French 
to fulfill my LSA language 
requirement (instead of trying 
to improve my Korean by using 
Duolingo). Maybe there’s a 
universe where I asked my 
parents more about Korean 
current events and history 
(instead of relying on Western 
media). But even in these 
universes, would someone still 
tell me I was whitewashed? 
Would someone still tell me 
to de-emphasize the Korean 
part of my identity? (Both 
of 
which 
have 
happened 
within the past two months). 
Would these questions and 
conversations still happen in a 
loop, regardless of whether I 
went to Korean school for more 
than one year or whether I kept 
my Korean name as my legal 
name or whether I could hold 
chopsticks the correct way?
It’s what I’m trying to 
explore in my writing. There 
are spaces of liminality, of 
in-betweenness, of what could 
have been and what has been 
and what has not yet been.

When I began to menstruate it 
was awkward to have to talk to my 
parents about finding a surprise 
that morning; I hid it from them 
as long as I could. I experienced 
excruciating aches and pains that 
at times forced me to stay home 
from school or ride them out 
because my parents had to go to 
work and couldn’t stay with me. 
I developed Polycystic Ovary 
Syndrome (PCOS) about a year 
ago. PCOS is a condition that 
causes 
hormonal 
deficiencies 
leading to prolonged or infrequent 
menstrual cycles or excess male 
hormone levels. PCOS is common 
among young menstruators, and 
it can be difficult to diagnose 
due to access to health services. 
Additionally, 
patients 
face 
challenges due to not being taken 
seriously at the doctor’s office and 
difficulty handling high treatment 
expenses. A common form of 
treating PCOS is to use an oral 
contraceptive, but birth control 
is not accessible to everyone due 
to treatment prices, lack of health 
insurance and inability to seek 
out a specialist such an OBGYN 
(obstetrician gynecologist). Much 
more needs to be done to ensure 
equitable access to menstrual 
products 
and 
to 
health-care 
services for menstruation-related 
conditions like PCOS. This is just 
what the PERIOD organization is 
striving to do. 
On October 19, 2019, the 
first 
National 
Period 
Day 

was celebrated. The PERIOD 
organization held sixty rallies 
in all U.S. states and in four 
countries calling for an end to 
the tampon tax, to celebrate 
menstruation, reduce stigma, and 
to advocate for menstrual equity 
by making menstrual products 
more affordable. The DotOrg, an 
organization on our U-M campus, 
hosted an event on the Diag 
Saturday as well. 
In thirty-five states, menstrual 
products are not labeled as 
essential products thus adding 
a sales tax on them (called a 
pink tax). Concerningly, women 
who face certain socioeconomic 
obstacles must choose between 
their next meal or buying period 
products in some instances. In a 
womens’ studies class I took, many 
students in the class expressed that 
they had to plan out when to buy 

period products because they are 
so expensive and that they had to 
mediate menstrual product prices 
with the need to buy groceries. 
The PERIOD organization also 
publicized that some have to use 
cardboard when menstruating 
because they cannot afford to 
purchase 
necessary 
products. 
The Menstrual Equity for All Act, 
proposed 
by 
Congresswoman 
Grace Meng in March, would 
require Medicaid to cover all 
costs for menstrual products 
while also mandating employers 
with 100 or more employees and 
all federal buildings to supply 
menstrual products. There is also 
an additional push to have these 
products free in schools, shelters 
and prisons. 
“If faces were bleeding, someone 
would do something” the PERIOD 
organization tweeted to promte 

National Period Day. While all 
menstruators are affected by this 
stigma, holding different identities 
cause menstruators to experience 
this stigma differently. Ending 
the stigma of menstruation must 
include 
all 
voices, 
especially 
those 
from 
Black, 
Brown, 
nonbinary, transgender and other 
marginalized voices. The language 
around 
menstruation 
has 
to 
change to be more inclusive of all 
genders and identities because not 
every person who menstruates is a 
woman. 
Donate to menstrual product 
drives. Laugh it off if a pad falls 
out of your backpack. Include 
others in this conversation about 
menstruation that are usually 
forgotten about. Uplift others, 
and make them feel good about 
menstruating (even though it can 
suck).

Now I feel like
I’m making up
for lost time.

Period.

Schlissel, support the arrestees and activism
O

n 
March 
15, 
2019, 
attendees 
and 
organizers 
of 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike occupied the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Fleming 
Administration 
Building. 
Though there was initially a long 
list of demands, by 5:00 p.m. 
(when the building officially 
closed), there was only one: A 
one 
hour, 
student-moderated 
public meeting with University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
to 
discuss a just transition to 
true 
carbon 
neutrality. 
The 
administration refused to accept 
the simple request. Instead they 
arrested 10 people — six U-M 
students, one recent graduate, 
two high school students and a 
community member. 
The University chose to arrest 
its own students over having a 
one-hour public meeting with 
them to discuss the climate crisis. 
The case continues to hang 
over the arrestees’ heads. Most 
are still going in and out of 
court, they are technically not 
allowed to leave the state and all 
the students are banned from 
the Fleming Building for a year 
(the non-students were banned 
from all of campus). It is a stain 
on the University. Schlissel and 
the Board of Regents should 
recognize their failure and call 
on the prosecution to drop the 
charges against the climate strike 
protesters. 
What is particularly appalling 
about the University’s behavior 
is that the climate protesters on 
March 15 did not show up out 
of nowhere. These students and 
their allies had tried everything 
in their power through the 
formal channels to get the 
University to take action on 
the climate crisis. They passed 
student government resolutions, 
applied for commission positions, 
wrote letters, demonstrated and 
spoke at board meetings. But still, 
there had been minimal progress 
beyond the creation of the flawed 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon Neutrality — the body 
charged with coming up with 
recommendations for when and 
how the University will get to 
carbon neutrality. 
Worse still, they ended up 
capitulating. Even though the 
administration refused to accept 
the climate strikers’ demands 
and instead chose to arrest the 
protesters, they scheduled a 
special town hall in response to 
the strike right after (though not 
under the terms requested). They 
arrested students for demanding 
what they ended up giving. 
While much of the harm 
caused by the climate strike 
arrests has already been done, 

there are still opportunities for 
mitigation. The University could 
admit that it was wrong to arrest 
the climate strikers and call for 
the charges to be dropped. Or 
they could decide that University 
employees, who were the only 
witnesses to the sit-in, have better 
things to do than testify against 
the students and not show up for 
court. 
Instead of mitigating harm, 
they 
have 
exacerbated 
it. 
In response to a motion the 
arrestees and their lawyer filed 
requesting more evidence from 
the University, the University 
asked most of the arrestees to 
pay for these legal fees. The 
University arrested its students, 
and asked them to pay their own 
legal fees. It’s almost comical 
until you realize it’s real. 

One of the purposes of the 
sit-in was to test what lengths 
the University would go to avoid 
talking 
with 
students 
about 
climate action. The conclusion? 
The 
University 
preferred 
to 
arrest 10 individuals rather than 
have a one-hour conversation. 
But the climate strike arrests and 
subsequent charges also clarified 
the way the administration views 
activism. 
The 
administration 
arrested 
protesters 
and 
is 
following through on the case to 
deter activism on campus. 
The 
University’s 
behavior 
towards the climate protesters 
reflects its dismissal of activism 
and fear of politics. Right now, the 
University hides behind a policy 
of not negotiating with protesters 
for any reason. That is an easy 
position to take — but one with 
profound costs. It undermines 
the long history of organizing 
and activism on this campus 
since its underlying assumption 
is that there will never be a 
situation where the University 
needs pressure to change. The 
University need only look to the 
STI policy reversal last month as 
an example of when it messed up 
and students told them so. 
Another fear the University 
seems to have is that if they 
drop the charges for climate 
protesters, then a precedent will 
be set for protesters of other 

issues. In other words, U-M will 
not call for the charges to be 
dropped because then they would 
be forced to call for charges to be 
dropped if, for example, there 
are white supremacists arrested 
on campus. Again, this is a false 
double standard. The University 
should not be afraid to say that 
some causes are more valid 
than others. Protesters trying 
to get the University to treat 
the climate crisis with urgency 
should be treated differently than 
hypothetical white supremacist 
protesters: It is sad to equate all 
forms of “activism,” regardless of 
the issue. 
This fear seems to come from 
the University’s sense that as a 
public institution, it should not be 
taking political stances. While it 
is obvious that the University only 
sees itself as a public institution 
when it is convenient to do so (see 
only 54 percent in-state students), 
it should realize that it is already 
a 
political 
institution. 
The 
University is making political 
statements when it chooses the 
year by which it wants to fully 
decarbonize, when it decides to 
give Flint and Dearborn students 
only 25 percent of the per-student 
funding Ann Arbor gets or when 
it decides to let Fraternity and 
Sorority Life use the old William 
Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center. 
But even if the University does 
not think those decisions are 
political, its Board of Regents 
are elected in partisan elections! 
The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
is a political institution and it 
should own it instead of backing 
away. By recognizing that it 
is a political institution, the 
University should realize that it 
was wrong to intimidate, arrest 
and let the prosecutor continue 
to charge students.
That’s where we come in. 
The University does not realize 
that, but we can make it clear. 
Students need to be more vocal 
in our opposition to the arrests 
than we have been so far. We 
should support the arrestees 
because they are working to push 
the University to take the climate 
crisis seriously, a noble task that 
should not be punished. But 
more broadly, if the University 
gets away with convicting the 
March 15 arrestees, it will have 
successfully 
sent 
a 
message 
that activism is not tolerated 
on campus, and we will all have 
been complicit in letting that 
message through. Support the 
climate strike arrestees and 
activism on campus by telling the 
University to call for the charges 
to be dropped.

In Iraq, the system hangs in the balance

Why Asians shouldn’t blame affirmative action
I

n early October, the long-
observed 
lawsuit 
against 
Harvard University was put 
to rest, in which Harvard was 
accused of discriminating against 
Asian-American 
undergraduate 
applicants. 
Judge 
Allison 
D. 
Burroughs rejected all claims in 
a 130-page document, admitting 
that the admissions process is 
“not perfect,” but claiming there 
is no need to “dismantle a very fine 
admissions program that passes 
constitutional 
muster, 
solely 
because it could do better.” 
I grew up in the Ann Arbor 
Public School system for the first 
five years of my life. I then moved 
to Seoul, South Korea at the age 
of 10, and I was shocked by the 
contrasting 
attitudes 
teachers, 
families and students had towards 
education. 
Throughout 
middle 
school, I attended more than 
five hagwons, which roughly 
translates into “cram schools” 
— for-profit private institutions 
students 
attend 
after 
school 
for more rigorous coursework. 
Like most of my peers, I only got 
an average of 6 hours of sleep 
every night due to homework 
and standardized test training. 
Students were so desperate for 
high scores that some would cheat 
on major standardized tests by 
calling students in other countries 
for answers. Many also resorted to 
suicide — the number one cause of 
death for South Korean youths is 
academic pressure. 
When I was applying to college, 
I moved back to the United 
States through a boarding school 
program. At this point, I was 
no stranger to the pressures of 
school. Thus, I wasn’t surprised 
by the nation’s skewed college 
process of bribing universities 
with donations or posing as a 
specific applicant, as seen in the 
case of “Varsity Blues.” However, 
given my poisonous relationship 
with school and the cases behind 
affirmative action, I began to think 
about what it meant to the Asian 
and Asian American communities. 
It raised questions between myself 
and my peers about whether 
our efforts were futile. Were our 
culture and common ambition for 
an elite education perpetuating 
stereotypes that would inevitably 
lead to our downfall? Was our race 
a more significant factor in our 
applications than our merit? 

A good place to understand an 
Asian/Asian-American viewpoint 
on affirmative action starts with 
the stigma around education. As 
a Korean American, I understand 
the pressure put on Asian students 
— especially by their peers and 
family — to succeed and perform 
well 
academically. 
Karthick 
Ramakrishnan, 
a 
professor 
of 
public policy and political science 
at the University of California-
Riverside, states that the reason 
why Asian Americans seemingly 
have this overt level of interest with 
elite colleges is because they believe 
prestigious institutions will shield 
them from discrimination in the 
work place. The Harvard lawsuit 
represents more than the inability 
of admission to a university. It shows 
that there remains a stereotype 
of Asians being diligent, quiet and 
technically competent. 
While I strongly identify and 
understand the affect affirmative 
action has had to the Asian/Asian-
American community, I agree with 
Burroughs’s decision to not change 
Harvard’s 
admission 
system. 
Affirmative action was created in an 
attempt to reverse the institutional 
racism against those historically 
disadvantaged, which has existed 
in prestigious education for years. 
Researchers Jennifer Giancola and 
Richard Kahlenberg from the Jack 
Kent Cooke Foundation found that 
“high-achieving 
students 
from 
the wealthiest families were three 
times as likely to enroll in a highly 
selective college as those (peers) 
from poorest families (24 versus 
8 percent).” The New York Times 
also examined the racial and ethnic 
makeup of 100 highly selective 
schools. They found that Black 
students, who make up 15 percent of 
college-age Americans, only make 
up 6 percent of college freshmen, 
while Hispanic students, who 
make up 22 percent of college-age 
Americans, only make up 13 percent 
of college freshmen.
Because of affirmative action, 
schools are able to create a diverse 
community of different genders, 
sexualities, 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds, ethnicities and races. 
With factors such as standardized 
testing, AP exams, essay tutoring, 
college application fees, tuition 
fees and college visits, applying to 
college is typically more straight-
forward if one is provided with 
the proper secondary education as 

well as socioeconomic background. 
Education is one of the biggest 
drivers of racial inequality and, 
while affirmative action acts as a 
Band-Aid solution, it allows the 
opportunity for overall progress. 
Affirmative 
action 
remains 
deeply flawed and needs major 
reform in order to fix issues, such 
as “mismatching.” The “mismatch” 
hypothesis claims that affirmative 
action in fact harms minority 
students by admitting students 
who are relatively unprepared 
to their classmates when they 
would’ve found more academic 
success 
at 
different 
schools. 
While “mismatching” is a recent 
phenomenon, studies have shown 
the severe effects this has had on 
minority students. Black college 
freshmen are more likely to 
declare STEM majors than white 
freshmen, but are twice as likely to 
abandon these fields. Black students 
who begin college in pursuit of a 
doctorate are also twice as likely to 
be deterred if attending a school in 
which they are mismatched. Even 
though affirmative action has deep 
fallacies that continue a cycle of 
educational inequality, the system 
is still imperative to hiring systems 
and college admissions in order to 
create a level playing field for all 
people. 
Instead of placing the blame on 
affirmative action for discriminatory 
actions against Asians and Asian 
Americans, the true root of the issue 
lies in applicant racial balancing. 
In The New Yorker, Jeannie Suk 
Gersen elucidates how the race-
conscious holistic review of college 
applications is not what perpetuates 
Asian discrimination and explains 
the true cause is the “sub-rosa 
deployment of racial balancing” 
that 
allows 
Asians 
to 
seem 
academically lower relative to white 
students. Rather than pursuing the 
eradication of affirmative action, 
a more effective solution would be 
to transform the stigma around an 
Asian applicant, and how specifically 
they stray from the model minority 
stereotype. Asian students shouldn’t 
have to actively avoid a personality 
certain of being “quiet and docile” in 
order to be accepted by prestigious 
institutions.

O

ver the past weeks, the 
Middle East has undergone 
drastic 
geopolitical 
changes that could alter the region’s 
dynamics for decades to come. 
While most news coverage has been 
focused on President Trump’s rash 
and foolhardy decision to abandon 
America’s Kurdish allies in Syria, this 
is not the only major development in 
the region. In Iraq, massive protests 
have erupted over the past month, 
clamoring for systematic reforms to 
the countries’ weak, ineffective and 
corrupt government. Though these 
protests lack defined leadership, 
the sheer pent-up frustration of 
millions of Iraqis may be enough 
to force concessions from the 
government and ensure at least a few 
meaningful changes. Furthermore, 
these protests point to the structural 
problems that are present in the Iraqi 
Constitution which likely make the 
government untenable long-term.
First, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
protests 
are 
generally quite common in Iraq and 
have essentially become a yearly 
tradition. Conventionally, protests 
have broken out during the summer 
months, when the government is 
often unable to provide citizens with 
enough water and electricity to bear 
the scalding heat. However, this 
year there were no summer protests 
Instead, unprecedented numbers of 
people took to the streets in October 
to protest against the government 
and political establishment as a 
whole. Beyond general frustration 
with the ruling class, demonstrators 
have demanded crackdowns on 
corruption, 
solutions 
to 
Iraq’s 
chronically 
high 
unemployment 
rate and improvements to the 
nation’s 
decrepit 
infrastructure. 
Crucially, the demonstrations are 
remarkably egalitarian, with an 
anti-establishment focus which is 
not associated with any particular 
religion, sect or political party. 
The protests were first sparked 
by the removal of the army’s 
counterterrorism 
second 
in 
command, General Abdul-Wahab 
Al-Saadi, who was widely viewed 
as the mastermind behind Iraq’s 

defeat of ISIS and considered to be a 
man of the people, unlike most Iraqi 
politicians. 
However, Iraqi citizens’ current 
frustrations can be traced beyond 
Al-Saadi’s dismissal and back to 
2003, when a U.S.-led coalition 
invaded the country, overthrew 
Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party 
and laid the framework for Iraq’s 
contemporary 
political 
system. 
This government setup, which was 
officially codified in the nation’s 2005 
constitution, is the fundamental 
problem that underpins Iraqis’ 
omnipresent disdain for their own 
government. The constitution is 
ambiguous and poorly written, 
creating a weak government that 
has been further encumbered by 
political infighting over some of the 
document’s more confusing clauses. 
Both the processes for nominating 
a prime minister and distributing 
oil revenue are somewhat unclear, 
limiting Iraq’s political and economic 
development. 
Today, the legacy of the 2005 
constitution hangs over Iraq, and 
many of its shortcomings are visible 
in the protesters’ complaints. The 
constitution’s vague position on oil 
revenue distribution has enabled 
widespread corruption and is the 
main contributor to Iraq’s economic 
struggles. Though Iraq’s oil exports 
are at an all-time high, the vast 
majority of profits go to a small cohort 
of elites and not towards addressing 
any of Iraq’s substantive societal 
issues. Additionally, the oil boom 
has not provided many new jobs in 
Iraq — the nation’s unemployment 
rate has hovered near 8 percent since 
2003, while its youth unemployment 
rate has remained near 17 percent 
throughout the same period. In 
conjunction with this economic 
stagnation, living conditions are 
worsening 
for 
many 
citizens, 
and a large proportion of Iraq’s 
infrastructure is in desperate need 
of repair after the nation’s lengthy 
battle with ISIS. 
In tandem with this economic 
angst, there is a justifiable sentiment 
among Iraqis that the government is 
corrupt, complicit in Iraq’s current 

predicament and has failed to serve 
its 
citizens. 
The 
government’s 
response to the protests has been 
inconsistent and included both 
repressive 
policing 
tactics 
and 
signs of genuine concern from the 
central government. On the streets, 
the protests have been met with 
aggression from the police force. As 
of today more than 100 protesters 
have been killed and thousands 
injured — something which has 
further galvanized the movement. 
However, the federal government 
does appear to be listening: Prime 
Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and 
several members of parliament 
have reached out to protesters, and 
conversations have apparently taken 
place. 
In 
the 
immediate 
future, 
these protests must adopt a more 
centralized structure in order to 
maximize their effectiveness. So far, 
the movement has relied on sheer 
numbers and managed to extract 
a few concessions from Mahdi, 
namely convincing him to pass a law 
mandating that all new oil projects in 
Iraq include at least 50 percent local 
workers. However, a disorganized 
mass can only do so much. By 
organizing, the protest movement 
can make concrete demands of 
elected officials and gain leverage 
over the government. 
In the longer term, this protest 
movement is a sign that Iraq’s 
current 
governmental 
system 
is 
fundamentally 
flawed, 
and 
structural reforms are necessary 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
continual 
stability. Iraq’s 2005 constitution 
has permitted the exploitation of its 
most valuable resource, entrenched 
a class of political elites and created 
a government that fails to respond 
to the needs of its citizens. As the 
most recent protests make clear, 
the Iraqi people are fed up with this 
unjust system and are united in their 
desire for meaningful governmental 
reform.

If there has been a name to know in architecture in 
the last decade, it’s Zaha Hadid. Though she won the 
Pritzker — the Pulitzer Prize for architecture — in 
2004, her most significant works have only cropped 
up in the last few years, even since her passing away in 
2016.
Last Tuesday, Satoshi Ohashi, Director of Zaha 
Hadid China, visited Taubman College’s spacious 
commons to talk on the breadth of his firm’s work 
worldwide, particularly in China. Ohashi himself is an 
alumnus of Taubman, graduating in 1984. In ’87, he met 
Hadid in her New York City apartment and was hired 
to her firm soon after. At this point, the firm was more 
of an atelier operation than an economy-shaping force. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The firm grew in the ’90s and shifted their 
conceptualization process from oil painting to digital. 
From the slides Ohashi showed of these early designs, 
the firm’s vocabulary of movement and fluidity has 
hardly changed in 30 years. Their influence has, 
though.
The now over 400 person team of young designers, 
computer scientists, civil engineers, product designers 
and video editors serve to spectacularize the firm’s 
work with a kind of self-promotion that certainly didn’t 
exist three decades ago. Ohashi had several videos 

prepared by the firm to run throughout — videos of 
austere atria, terrific terraces and, above all, captivating 
curves with thousands of people moving in time lapse 
over high-octane electronic music. 
There’s no doubt the firm is at the forefront of 
architectural technology, but with the advent of such 
tech and the overachieving millennials who made it out 
of the firm’s vast applicant pool, they’ve overstepped 
the bounds of architecture and have reached a scale of 
production that is nothing less than irresponsible.
Without differentiation, Ohashi flipped from slides 
of Zaha buildings to slides of Zaha furniture, Zaha 
running wear, Zaha electric cars, Zaha jewelry. This 
blurring of the distinction in design between these 
fields isn’t what bothers me. Architects are designers, 
and if there’s a will within the firm to use their influence 
to pursue their curiosities, then so be it. 
But architects are also directly responsible for 
orchestrating the climate crisis we have at hand. On 
top of every building created are on average hundreds 
to thousands of sheets of paper, all kinds of plastic-
styrofoam composite models, and only after design do 
you get to the real problem of construction (which as 
an industry accounts for 23 percent of global carbon 
emissions).
A necessary evil, maybe, but not in the development 
of 3.5 million square foot tech complexes (the area of 
60 football fields). These buildings are really quite 
impressive until you boil them down into a compilation 
of 20 others nearly the same. Visually, they looks like 
eggs moving through water. Functionally, they’re all 
integrated into transport networks, they all spur the 
development of previously unoccupied neighborhoods 
and they all host hundreds of companies that will also 
produce, produce, produce.
We all play the capitalism game, no doubt, but this 
is excess at the expense of us all. Hadid’s designs are at 
their best the vanguard of design technology, at their 
worst streamlined material towers. Next time you’re in 
one (in about any major city), consider for yourself if its 
cultural capital is worth its environmental expense.
Ohashi seemed at home back in Taubman, but the 
work on show didn’t reflect what he was saying or the 
attitudes of those in the crowd. Slight head-shaking 
could be seen from particular staff and students 
throughout. Though at first this may have been in awe 
of the work — work a student can aspire to — it soon 
became in disapproval.

Hailing from the East Coast and the diner 
capital of the United States (New Jersey) I 
was a little caught off guard when I arrived 
at the University and all of the in-state 
kids kept talking about “Coney Island.” 
I 
imagined 
the 
residential 
Brooklyn 
neighborhood, 
which 
is 
swarmed 
by 
tourists and dotted with crowded beaches, 
a ferris wheel 
and 
greasy 
boardwalk 
concessions. 
It 
wasn’t 
too 
special. 
Eventually, 
though, 
I 
realized that 
the 
Coney 
Island I was 
familiar with 
wasn’t 
the 
same 
Coney 
Island 
new 
friends 
and 
classmates 
spoke 
of 
with 
such 
affection. 
Their 
Coney 
Island 
wasn’t 
an 
amusement 
park, though 
it is a different sort of novelty in and of 
itself. 
The 
Michigan 
Coney 
Island 
is 
a 
restaurant. Rather, a genre of restaurant — 
all similar in nature and menu items with 
individual idiosyncrasies and quirks that 
make them distinct. These eccentricities 
are how citizens of Michigan select their 
“favorite” Coney Island. There are apparent 
loyalists to one chain, and once “you find 
your Coney place” it’s game over. There’s 
National Coney Island, Jackson Coney 
Island, Abe’s Coney Island, Virginia Coney 
Island, American Coney Island, Kerby 
Koney Island, Leo’s Coney Island; to name 
a few. The first one opened in 1914 in 
Jackson, Michigan, and now these hot dog 
kingdoms span the entire state. From what 
I gathered from some research on the topic, 
Coney Island has served a large purpose in 
providing affordable, easy lunch options for 
workers in the auto industry in the early-
mid 20th century. There are 500 Coney 
Islands in and around Detroit alone. 
The menu is standard from chain to 
chain. The pinnacle is the “coney dog” 
which is a hot dog in a steamed bun, topped 
with chilli, diced raw onions and yellow 
mustard. The dog has donned the nickname 
of a “coney” and is essentially the state food 
of Michigan. More staples are the “loose 
hamburger,” which is essentially a sloppy 
joe; loaded chili fries; a variety of different 
Greek dishes (kebab, gyro, greek salad) and 
typical American diner dishes like pancakes 
and omelettes. 
After more than three years at the 
University of Michigan, I’ve heard countless 
stories and love letters to these strange 
establishments from in-state friends who 
look back on their high school years with 
fond, half-fuzzy memories of Coney Island. 
I’ve heard so many reflections of winding 
up in a booth at Coney Island, or hungover 
desires to have a 10 a.m. coney dog or the 
chicken finger pita awaiting my friends 
come Thanksgiving. At some point, I 
became intrigued. 
Being that many of my own teenage 
memories were made in the now-closed 
Red Bank Diner or the still-standing, 
luminescent and sticky Americana Diner 
after a pitchy Saturday night high-school 
production of The Little Mermaid, Coney 
Island enticed me. I didn’t feel exactly 
appetized by the idea of a hot dog on a 
chipped white plate or pancakes drenched in 
watery syrup, but I also felt some attraction 
to the idea of seeing what it’s all about. So 
when I finally had the opportunity present 

itself, in the very early hours of a Sunday 
morning in September in Birmingham, 
Michigan, I took it. 
We walked in, 2 a.m., under the influence 
of many vodka laden beverages. The interior 
of Leo’s is sort of a panopticon, and sort of a 
rare form of ’70s hell. It’s as though whoever 
designed the restaurant wanted everyone 
to notice how much alcohol can affect 
formerly well done makeup and blown out 
hair to a point of near decrepit. The lighting 
is bright fluorescent and burns your eyes 
and reflects off of the shiny tables so that 
all 
you 
can 
bare to do is 
sit. At two in 
the morning, 
everyone 
in the place 
is under 26 
and 
nobody 
ages for the 
30 
minutes 
they 
spend 
touching 
shoulders in a 
sweaty booth 
eating 
chili 
with 
friends 
and 
friends 
of 
friends 
who all have 
the spins. It’s 
an 
ethereal 
experience. 
The food at 
Leo’s is a 0/10 
in a culinary 
way, but a 10/10 in serving its purpose: to be 
as greasy and inexpensive and nonsensical 
as possible. 
As we waited for our order to be brought 
to the table (I did not do the ordering for 
sake of authenticity), the two Michigan 
natives I was with swapped stories of times 
they wound up in that very Leo’s Coney 
Island. Leo’s was the place they came after 
drinking vodka from water bottles at age 
18 in someone’s basement, or to reconvene 
and reminisce in the morning, soberly, 
after a night out at age 20. It’s the place 
they came with their lacrosse teams after 
a big game they lost, where they stumbled, 
haphazardly, arm in arm with their three 
best friends on Christmas break after 
freshman year of college as though nothing 
has changed, a place they regarded as a 
beacon of greasy hope after every night out, 
and on every trip home.
We had the nachos supreme which, in 
the moment, tasted pretty good, or I just 
ignored how disgusting it is to put chili 
and onions on top of tortilla chips and 
proceed to eat them under hot, fluorescent 
lights. We also had coney fries, with cheese, 
which weren’t good but also weren’t bad, 
and boasted the hidden delight of more 
strangely thin chili. We finished the grand 
buffet of approximately 3000 calories 
with bacon cheddar potato skins and an 
additional side of fries that were absolutely 
pallid in color. The next morning I shivered 
with every recall of the way the chili sat 
atop those soggy tortilla chips. 
I can not imagine eating at Leo’s Coney 
Island sober, or at any time before 11 
p.m. and after 5 a.m. But the meal was a 
larger realization in the experience that 
a restaurant can bring to diners — an 
experience that sometimes has nothing 
to do with the food. There’s an ambiance 
there. There are memories ingrained in the 
walls. There are stories of firsts, lasts, bests 
and worsts. You remember who you ate 
with, when and what and why even if you’ve 
been 1000 times before because it’s distinct 
and it’s a reminder of home, or of being 20 
years old or perhaps it just reminds you 
of Michigan. Leo’s Coney Island doesn’t 
succeed for its hot dog or chicken finger 
pita, though the menu covers pretty much 
all the bases of quintessential drunk food 
and I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t eat it 
again. It succeeds in its authenticity and its 
integrity, in its desire to put up no facade. 
It does not try to be anything it isn’t, even 
if the air smells like meat and, for that, I’d 
return.

Mythos and Coney Island:

When most people think of adult animation, they 
typically think of a raunchier version of children’s 
cartoons — slapstick comedy with a dash of adult 
themes. Now when people think of adult themes, they 
typically imagine sex, drugs and alcohol — which isn’t 
far from the truth — but these three elements alone 
don’t encapsulate the real hardships adults go through 
that people never talk about. “Bojack Horseman” has 
been performing a balancing act of the two sides of 
adulthood for its past five seasons, and now that it’s 
coming to an end, I can’t help but wonder whether the 
adult animation industry will ever be able to put out a 
show as clever, consistent, hopeful and heartbreaking 
again.
The final season is split up into two eight-part 
installations, the second part coming out on Jan. 31. The 
first installment picks up right where season five left off 
about a year ago, with Bojack (Will Arnett, “Riviera”) 
finally making a step toward change and admitting 
himself into rehab. Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris, “At 
Home with Amy Sedaris”) learns to balance work life 
and motherhood, Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins, 
“Tangled: The Series”) learns how to cope with being a 
bad dog, Todd (Aaron Paul, “El Camino: A Breaking Bad 
Movie”) gets serious about taking on his ambitions and 
Diane (Alison Brie, “GLOW”) embraces her new career 
in investigative journalism. The characters underwent 
the most development in season five, which is why it was 
surprising to see that the show was coming to an end so 
soon.
In many ways, season five was an opportunity for 
the show to do new things with the new circumstances 
that each character had to deal with, and at times, the 
show’s abrupt end made some arcs in season six seem 
like fan service (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing if 

you’re a fan). After all, they had to tie up all the loose 
ends in 16 half-hour episodes, which isn’t much time 
considering all the time and effort the creators spent 
developing a plot as complex as this. The only reason 
why I may sound bitter about the decision to end this 
show is because Aaron Paul, who voices Todd Chavez, 
tweeted out something that made it seem a little like this 
was Netflix’s fault. But that’s besides the point.
Throughout 
the 
past 
few 
seasons, 
“Bojack 
Horseman” has scattered in a few episodes here and 
there where they focus on one character, and in this new 
season they continue with this device. In a valid attempt 
to wrap things up without rushing important plotlines, 
some episodes, like the second episode of season six, 
focus solely on characters like Princess Carolyn, who 
the creators have done a thorough job of developing 
since the start of the show. Like always, they never fail 
to incorporate real issues gracefully into the plot. In this 
particular episode, Princess Carolyn struggles to take 
care of her newborn adopted baby whilst living under 
the pressure of being a working mom who can do it all. 
The episode features silhouettes of Princess Carolyn 
taking care of tasks in the background along with 
distracting noises of her completing these actions, so the 
viewer can feel just as hectic and frazzled as she does.
They wrap up just enough loose ends and introduce 
just enough conflict to set up the second part of the final 
season, and it’s difficult to try and predict how the final 
eight episodes will turn out. I for one, question everyday 
whether it’s worth keeping Netflix around when they 
keep increasing prices, cancelling good shows and 
renewing garbage. There’s been too many “Bojack 
Horseman”-quality shows tossed to the wind and at 
this rate, I’m afraid we’ll be left with content like “The 
Kissing Booth.” With all the new streaming services 
coming out, Netflix’s reign might soon be over, and 
after this show ends, I might not be so sad to see it go. So 
watch out Netflix — I might just stop using my friend’s 
account.

If you pay any attention to celebrity gossip, you know 
that Hailey and Justin Bieber have had two weddings, 
lots of church dates and even suffered through head 
lice together. You also might know that since she was 
hospitalized in October 2018, Selena Gomez has been 
quietly focusing on improving her mental health. And 
even if you don’t remember any of that, I’m guessing 
the part of your mind reserved for the Disney-adjacent 
drama of your youth can recall that Selena and Justin 
have a lot of history together. They were on and off from 
2011 to March 2018 — breaking up just four months 
before Bieber proposed to Hailey Baldwin that July. The 
media left fans to speculate how Selena felt, but on Oct. 
23 with the release of her single “Lose You to Love Me,” 
she told all.
“We’d always go into it blindly / I needed to lose you 
to find me” Gomez realizes as piano notes fade into an 
echo chamber of background vocals. She mentions the 
engagement (“in two months you replaced us / like 
it was easy”), but the hurt in her voice is from years of 
mistreatment, not surprise. “You promised the world / 
and I fell for it” could very well characterize the cyclical 
nature of their relationship as she took him back again 
and again despite his cheating. While I’m not sure that 
any non-Gomez fans will be won over by “Lose You to 
Love Me,” as its sound and lyrics are relatively average, 
the song is remarkable in its maturity. 
Gomez, now an avid mental health advocate, has 
been vocal about seeking help in her darkest times, and 
now she’s shining through. In fact, “Lose You to Love 
Me” isn’t so much about Bieber as it is about Gomez’s 
struggle to accept herself. Even when she seems to call 
him out, for example, by singing “Set fires to my forest 
/ and you let it burn” she understands that it’s pointless 
to drag him — she can’t control the poor choices he’s 
made. Instead, Gomez is focused on her reaction. She 
takes off the “rose colored glasses” she had for him 
and remembers that she gave it her “all.” When Gomez 
ultimately decides “I needed to hate you to love me,” it’s 
not to spite Justin, but to save herself. 
The music video echoes this process of acceptance. 
Many different Selenas fade into each other in black 

and white, all seated like they’re at a confession booth. 
Angry, sad, disgusted, laughing, confused, Gomez finally 
settles into a smirk, and then she’s O.K.. While the video 
is a bit disorienting (it was shot entirely on an iPhone 
and heavily edited), it’s fitting. Their relationship was 
such an emotional rollercoaster it makes sense that she 
felt everything at once when the ride officially ended. 
The next single, “Look at Her Now,” was released 
24 hours later. The flip side to heartbreak, this song 
is a celebration. The “mm-mm-mm mm-mm-mm 
mm-mm” hook is extraordinarily catchy, to the point 
that it’s either irresistible or unbearable. But even if 
this earworm is unwelcome, it will make you want to 
dance. “Of course she was sad / but now she’s glad / 
she dodged a bullet,” Gomez shrugs. This song more 
clearly chronicles their ups and downs (“fast nights that 
got him / that new life was his problem”), but similarly 
shoves it all in the past. 
By referring to herself in the third person in “Look 
at Her Now,” not only does Gomez more effectively 
detach herself from the pain she’s singing about moving 
on from, but she also emphasizes the universality of 
her experience: “She knows she’ll find love / only if 
she wants it / She knows she’ll find love / only up from 
the way down,” Gomez assures herself and her young, 
mostly female audience. Yes, getting over a long, toxic 
relationship is hard, she affirms, but you’re going to find 
love if you want to find love. You’re not alone.
That’s why Gomez dances surrounded by lookalikes 
and flashing colors in the “Look at Her Now” music 
video. Not overly joyous or sharp in her movements, 
she looks cool, collected and comfortable. Seemingly 
months removed from the “Lose You to Love Me” video, 
Gomez isn’t trying to convince anyone of her well-being. 
It’s evident in the way she picks up the iPhone herself 
and looks directly into the camera. She’s over it.
Together, these songs close a chapter. Although 
hearing about the progression of the Bieber-Gomez 
saga should be boring by now, it’s too relatable. And 
for that reason, it’s so important that Gomez shares 
her story. If anyone was exhausted by the back-and-
forth, it was her. Her ability to come out on the other 
side better than OK, having grown and learned to love 
herself, is incredibly hopeful for anyone who relates to 
her hurt. Gomez has tried to start over so many times 
and now, finally, she has.

Melville’s “Moby Dick” once every two 
hours and indicate their location in the 
story. I haven’t read the novel in years, and 
I can’t honestly say that it stuck with me 
in a profoundly memorable way. But I find 
this account fascinating for its context in 
the general mess of Twitter (that is to say, 
its lack of context with anything else in 
my timeline). I found a similarly passive 
appreciation for Robert Eggers’s (“The 
Witch”) “The Lighthouse” for its zany 
boldness.
There might be a reason that the grimy 
sailors-caught-out-at-sea myths appeal so 
strongly to me now, but I refuse to pinpoint 
it. Regardless, “The Lighthouse” is certainly 
one of the most compelling horror movies 
of the year, one that will be rewatched time 
and time again by those who dare to embrace 
its madness. Above all, the film hones in on 
what makes the 2010s a particularly special 
decade for the horror genre.
The 
film 
does 
not 
stray 
far 
from 
Melvillian territory, playing out like a series 
of hallucinatory vignettes from two newly 
stationed lighthouse keepers on a remote 
island in the 19th century. Thomas Wake, 
the older, gruffer and scruffier of the two 
is played by Willem Dafoe (“Vox Lux”) in 
one of the most fleshed-out performances 
of his career. He is rageful and briny and 
barking, but he is quippy too, in a guffawing 
grandfatherly way. Dafoe’s impending snub 
for a Best Actor nomination will be lamented 
by horror fans in the likes of Toni Collete 
in “Hereditary” and Essie Davis in “The 
Babadook”.
His companion on the island is Robert 
Pattinson’s (“High Life”) Ephraim Winslow, 
a mustached, squeaky-voiced Canadian with 
an alcohol addiction and a general disdain 
for working life. The two actors are the only 
speaking characters in the entire movie, 
but have electric chemistry that keeps 
“The Lighthouse” from dragging for even a 
moment.
As equally important to the experience as 
the pair’s performance is the way the film 
is shot. Eggers constrains his camera with 
a squarish 1.19:1 aspect ratio as well as a 
black-and-white lens. The result is obviously 
claustrophobic and indicative of the time 
period, but it also has an important effect on 
how the director chooses to compose each 
frame. Most notably, Eggers employs two-
shots sparingly. whenever we see our main 
characters, they are typically alone. They are 
often facing the camera directly, resembling 
Jonathan 
Demme’s 
uncomfortable 
POV 
close-ups in “The Silence of the Lambs.” 
The deteriorating sense of personal space, 
exacerbated by low ceilings and ominous 
lighting on builds into the film’s conclusion, 
leaving a viewer squeamish and discomfited. 
Moreover, when both characters appear in 
the same frame, they appear pressed against 
each other, poised for conflict but intimate 

and, occasionally, romantic. Winslow and 
Wake are deeply repressed — they ache for 
any escape from the dry monotony of the 
island, and their drunken nightly musings 
dance beautifully on the line between 
revelation and foolspeak. 
In many ways, “The Lighthouse” is a 
testament to the foothold that horror has 
on the film industry in 2019. To think that 
a film so utterly deranged could be funded, 
produced and even limitedly released in 
another decade is unfathomable. But “The 
Lighthouse” understands what makes the 
horror of today successful: an arthouse 
director that infuses intellect behind every 
scare, a perfectly assembled cast performing 
at the top of its potential, commentary 
that transforms the very real into the very 
personal and a level of technical craft 
that requires multiple viewings to fully 
appreciate. 
Robert Eggers is likely one of the savviest 
young voices in horror. It’s easy to say that he 
played the same cards with “The Lighthouse” 
as he did with his debut feature in 2015, 
“The Witch.” After all, they are both period-
horror with limited settings, a naturalistic 
tone and measured pacing. But beyond the 
surface, they couldn’t be more different. 
Where “The Witch” devotes an intense focus 
to its broad ideas of feminism, colonialism 
and Puritanism, “The Lighthouse” is not so 
clear about its message, preferring to pull its 
viewers subjectively along into the madness. 
If anything, this pairing illustrates Eggers’s 
range as a filmmaker. He isn’t bound to 
the coherency of his narratives; he is more 
attentive to the gnawing, gnarling, all-
consuming experience of horror itself.

Cesar Ruiz heard the question, then 

he cracked a smile.

Do you guys feel like you wrote 

a memorable chapter in this rivalry 

tonight?

The 
junior 
center 
responded 

immediately: “Um, yes.”

Last week, Michigan got its second 

loss at Penn State, effectively ending any 

hopes of a Big Ten championship and 

the College Football Playoff. In the days 

leading up to the Wolverines’ matchup 

with Notre Dame, the biggest question 

was clear: What is there still to play for?

Michigan players insisted there was 

still plenty, most of all the chance to 

beat their rivals, but it was still a little 

hard to believe. At least, until Hassan 

Haskins ran 25 yards — several with a 

tackler on his back — on the Wolverines’ 

second drive of the game, one that 

eventually ended in a Zach Charbonnet 

touchdown.

And as the heavens descended on Ann 

Arbor, Michigan seemed unfazed. An 

offense that had struggled for explosive 

plays all year ripped off four 20-plus 

yard runs in the first half alone. The 

Wolverines (6-2 overall, 3-2 Big Ten) 

rode that run game and their typical 

stingy defense to a 45-14 win over No. 8 

Notre Dame (5-2) in arguably the most 

impressive win of the Jim Harbaugh 

era.

“We realized after (last week), going 

into this week for Monday’s practice 

that offensively, we’ve gotta come out 

that way from start to finish,” said 

senior quarterback Shea Patterson. “You 

can’t come out flat and expect to make a 

comeback in the end. They helped out 

our defense, our defense played lights 

out tonight. I thought we executed all 

night offensively and I think the results 

show for themselves.”

Though Michigan had to settle for a 

field goal on its first drive, it made one 

thing clear: it was run-it-down-their-

throats time.

Patterson didn’t complete a pass until 

the second quarter, after his team was 

already up 10-0 — and with the rainy 

conditions, it was probably for the better. 

After the field goal, the Wolverines 

scored touchdowns on two straight 

drives, both by freshman running back 

Zach Charbonnet. And after he pulled a 

defender with him on the first of those 

two drives, Haskins hurdled his would-

be tackler in the second, an encore to a 

20-yard rush that sent 110,000 fans in 

maize ponchos into a frenzy.

“We said in the locker room, we knew 

what kind of game it was gonna be,” Ruiz 

said. “We changed the openers a little 

bit. We knew we were gonna be ground 

and pounding a lot today. It’s the game 

we’ve been waiting for. We love running 

the ball. And just, we knew today was 

gonna be the day we were gonna be able 

to showcase it.”

Haskins finished with 149 yards 

on 20 attempts, a career high, while 

Charbonnet added 74 yards on 15 

attempts for two touchdowns and tied a 

program-record nine touchdowns for a 

freshman running back.

As the rain slowed in the third 

quarter, so did Michigan — going three-

and-out on three consecutive drives and 

then giving up a touchdown to cut its 

lead to 10. But the Wolverines stayed the 

course, coming back for a touchdown 

drive that included a Haskins 49-yard 

rush to put them up, 24-7. Then, they 

opened up the passing game and ran up 

the score with three touchdowns in the 

fourth quarter.

Through 
the 
entire 
game, 
the 

Wolverines found an offensive identity 

and stuck to it, never deviating from the 

run, even when those drives stalled in 

the third quarter. Notre Dame did the 

opposite, looking befuddled with every 

move Michigan made. Book readied to 

throw, even with pass-rushers in his 

face on nearly every play, even when the 

ball slipped around as rain continued to 

fall.

With their fierce running game, the 

Wolverines answered the questions of 

offensive identity that have surrounded 

them all season. They also answered the 

question of whether a rivalry win was 

enough of a motivation for a team whose 

goals were much loftier.

MICHIGAN GETS SIGNATURE WIN, DESTROYS NOTRE DAME IN RAINSTORM

SPORTSMONDAY


2B — October 28, 2019

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

W

hen a stoic Nick 
Eubanks stood at the 
podium after a defac-
ing 35-14 loss at Wisconsin, his 
assessment 
was frank.
“It’s up 
to us to find 
an identity,” 
Eubanks said 
then. “We got 
a game com-
ing up next 
Saturday. We 
gotta find it 
quick.”
Up to that 
point — a game in which Michigan 
mustered next to nothing until 
the depths of garbage time — the 
Wolverines’ self-proclaimed iden-
tity had rarely been called into 
question.
From the outset of the season, 
Michigan’s offense has tried as 
hard as it could to be different, in 
any way, shape or form. “Speed 
in space” was a distillation of a 
promised reinvention. The procla-
mations of change were loud and 
direct; offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis was going to modernize 
it all, every play would require a 
read, the bells and whistles would 
sing.
Two things now appear clear. 
One: That didn’t work as intended. 
Two: That’s OK.
Because when things didn’t 
work in the first half of the season, 
the players and coaches realized 
maybe the ways of old weren’t so 
bad after all. It’s worth remember-
ing, the Wolverines finished 25th 
in offensive SP+, their best such 
ranking since 2011. 
“We’re bringing back some 
stuff that worked last year,” said 
senior guard Michael Onwenu, 
shortly after his offensive line 
tossed around a stout Notre Dame 
front Saturday night. “Watching 
previous games and it’s important 
to bring that back and do what 
worked instead of trying every-
thing else.”
Onwenu and his unit spear-
headed a rushing attack that ran 
for 303 yards on 57 carries in 

Michigan’s 45-14 win over the 
Irish. It did so in a manner eerily 
akin to the Wolverines’ three-
game win streak over ranked 
opponents last year. In those 
games, wins over No. 15 Wiscon-
sin, No. 24 Michigan State and 
No. 14 Penn State, the Wolverines 
averaged 278.3 rushing yards on 51 
attempts. 
It was the defining stretch for 
that team, when it found out who 
it was and harnessed that into 
some of the best football of the Jim 
Harbaugh era. 
This group appears primed to 
hit a similar stride. In 21 drives 
over the last six quarters, the 
Wolverines’ offense has just five 
three-and-outs. They have over 
400 yards in four of their last five 
games, with the lone outlier com-
ing against Iowa that is sixth in 
SP+ defense, and, importantly, 
came in a 10-3 win.
It’s a group unapologetically 
anchored by a running game, 
featuring the same core tenants 
of last year’s ethos: pin-and-pulls, 
traps and basic zone looks. It 
would be remiss not to mention 
offensive line coach Ed Warriner’s 
role in this recalibration. He’s 
the one that overhauled the run 
scheme a year ago, and simplified 
the offensive line requirements 
that ultimately bred vast improve-
ment.
“Every team’s different,” War-
riner said last week. “There’s no 
carry over. You’ve got carry over 
players, but you have to establish 
who you are and what you want 
to do. And then you evaluate. At 
some point, you have to say, here’s 
what we’re good at.”

Still, Michigan fired Pep Ham-
ilton and hired Gattis for a reason, 
and the recent simplification is not 
inherently an indictment of that 
decision. There’s a maturity in 
understanding what you are and 
what you aren’t, and not trying to 
shove a square peg in a round hole 
by hoping to solve the latter.
When Eubanks offered that 
plea shortly after the loss to the 
Badgers, he did so under the same 
pretense of change. There was an 
idea of what this offense was sup-
posed to be, and it hadn’t lived up 
to the billing.
The identity is not “speed in 
space” in the way most conceived 
that vision, and the players don’t 
seem to care.
“Our identity is whatever it is 
for that week,” said junior center 
Cesar Ruiz. “I don’t wanna say 
one thing or another cause we can 
attack it however we want to.”
Increasingly, though, this team 
is learning that not all change is 
good. This team now knows what 
it is — something that could not 
be said when Eubanks offered his 
assessment. It’s a team that’s going 
to look to pound the ball first, then 
work off of it with a trove of down-
field weapons. It’s a team that can 
lean on its defense, careful not to 
make the game-changing mistake 
offensively. It’s not a team that’s 
going to reinvent the wheel. It is a 
team that will dispose of inferior 
ones, and win quite a few games. 
It’ll beat some good teams, too. It’s 
a team well in-line with the prec-
edent Harbaugh has set at Michi-
gan through five years.
That’s not such a bad thing, 
after all.

A new but familiar identity
Wolverines fall, 1-0, against Rutgers

The No. 16 Michigan women’s 
soccer team was winning in 
every statistical category. If you 
were watching the game and 
didn’t look at the scoreboard, 
it looked like the Wolverines 
were going to cruise to another 
victory. 
They led in all categories but 
one — goals. 
Michigan 
(13-4-1 
overall, 
8-2-1 Big Ten) dominated No. 21 
Rutgers early on in the match 
Thursday night. Up until the 
43rd minute, it looked like the 
Wolverines were positioned for 
a win. But soccer is a fickle game 
and can change in an instant, 
and Michigan lost, 1-0.
In what was the Scarlet 
Knights’ 
first 
successful 
offensive 
set, 
and 
the 
Wolverines’ first and only lapse 
on 
defense, 
Rutgers 
sliced 
through the Michigan defense 
and scored. The Wolverines 
found themselves down and 
couldn’t recover. 
“Sometimes you can just be 
a little unlucky and one thing 
changes in a snapshot,” said 
sophomore midfielder Raleigh 
Loughman. “You just have to 
keep your head up and keep 
going.”
In the beginning of the first 
half, Michigan dominated the 
field by controlling the ball on 
its side of the field, accompanied 
by clean passing and transitions. 
Every time the Scarlet Knights 
took the ball onto their side 
of the field, the Wolverines 
tightened up on defense and 
immediately cleared it back to 
their offense. 
In 
the 
first 
half 
alone, 
Michigan had seven shots but 
was unable to convert any of 
those into goals. The Wolverines 
set themselves up with many 
opportunities 
with 
corner 
kicks and crosses, but failed to 
execute in front of the goal. 
“I think the main thing our 

team really needs to work on 
is execution,” said freshman 
forward Jayde Riviere. “We 
have all the tools for it and we 
have all the talent for it. We get 
crosses in and we get people in 
the box, it’s just the execution 
of it.”
Throughout 
the 
season, 
Michigan has not been used 
to going into halftime with 
a deficit. While this was an 
unwelcomed change, it did not 
change its mindset or gameplan 
for the second half. 
“At halftime, we told them 
we just needed to be aggressive 
and look to get going forward 
a little more,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein. “You got 
nothing to lose and just go for 
it. I thought we went out with 
a good mentality and got great 
opportunities. We were just 
unfortunate.” 
Coming 
out 
of 
the 
half 
down by a goal, the team stuck 
to its gameplan, focusing on 
execution 
and 
converting 
opportunities into goals, but 
realized it needed to play with 
a greater sense of urgency. 
The Wolverines added seven 
more shots in the second half, 
totaling 14 for the game, and 
held Rutgers to just seven shots 
the entire 90 minutes.
“Obviously being down 1-0 

there was a lot more urgency 
to our game,” Loughman said. 
“I felt like we were getting 
forward more and being less 
sloppy in our passes. We were 
a little less complacent in the 
second half than we were in the 
first half.”
Klein credited the Scarlet 
Knights’ commitment to their 
defense and strong goalkeeping.
Looking 
ahead 
to 
the 
postseason, Loughman believes 
Rutgers is a similar caliber team 
that Michigan will face.
“Rutgers is a really strong 
opponent and I think they are 
evidence of what we are going 
to find in the postseason,” 
Loughman 
said. 
“We 
have 
to keep looking at that going 
forward.”
In their penultimate regular-
season game, the Wolverines 
were 
trying 
to 
position 
themselves for seeding in the 
Big Ten Tournament. They are 
currently neck-and-neck with 
Wisconsin for the top spot in 
the Big Ten standings. 
“I hope (this game) gives 
us a good spark and a sense of 
urgency to finish strong,” Klein 
said. “We will see where we end 
up when it comes to Big Ten play 
and NCAAs but hopefully this 
loss sparks a response to go and 
get it.”

In the last 10 seconds of 
regulation, the Michigan men’s 
soccer team almost earned a 
penalty kick. The near buzzer 
beater 
would 
have been the 
highlight 
of 
the 
season 
for 
Michigan 
if it was not 
a clean slide 
tackle. 
The 
Wolverines 
(7-4-4 overall, 
2-1-3 Big Ten) 
tied 1-1 against 
the Wisconsin 
Badgers (2-10-
3, 0-4-2), in what seemed 
to 
be 
a 
lopsided 
soccer 
game. 
Michigan 
dominated 
Wisconsin in shots 17 to eight. 
Michigan was in complete 
control throughout the entire 
match. It was a frustrating 
result for the Wolverines who 
held the majority of the clinical 
chances. 
“We really had clear cut-
chances, 
but 
I 
think 
we 
absolutely 
dominated 
the 
match from start to finish,” 
said 
Michigan 
head 
coach 
Chaka Daley. “There was 22 
fouls here, and 13 corners. 
With all of that, we had a lot 
of opportunities. Wisconsin 
fought for their lives because 
they had to with no real 
chances for them.” 
Michigan 
was 
knocking 
on the door five minutes into 
the second half while looking 
for the first goal of the game. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Soso 
Emovon provided a spark off 
the bench for the Wolverines. 
He led one of Michigan’s best 
chances to score in the 48th 
minute. Emovon thunderously 
ran down the right side of the 
pitch and crossed the ball to 
freshman 
midfielder 
Harry 
Pithers. Pithers was unable to 
make a strike on the left alone 
ball from five yards out. 
In the 75th minute, the 

Wolverines’ 
ultra 
attacking 
efforts finally paid off. Senior 
forward Jack Hallahan tapped 
the ball around the 15-yard box 
which cleared off the shin of a 
Badger defender into the back 
of the net for an own goal.
Two 
minutes 
after 
the 
own 
goal, 
junior 
midfielder 
Marc 
Ybarra’s 
tackle led to a 
questionable 
penalty 
call. 
Badger 
midfielder 
Noah 
Leibold 
shimmied 
his 
way into sinking 
the goal down 
the 
middle 
for 
Wisconsin. 
Daley had no issues with the 

penalty. “There was a small 
patch of opportunity, and I 
was not able to see the penalty 
call,” Daley said. “It was out of 
our hands.” 
Senior goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi was the most important 
player 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Verdi was carried out with an 
injury during overtime, but 
his efforts were not unnoticed. 
Five minutes into extra time, 
Verdi made a miraculous save 
in, “what seemed to be a sure 
goal well outside the penalty 
box,” Daley said. “He was 
excellent. Andrew saved our 
butt in overtime. He made two 
great saves and hopefully he’s 
okay.”

Andrew 
Verdi 
is 
the 
backbone 
of 
the 
Michigan 
men’s soccer team, literally and 
figuratively.
The senior goalkeeper is 
the team’s last line of defense. 
Often times, he is the difference 
between wins and losses.
And 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ 
Senior Night on Friday, he 
proved that to be true, making 
saves in a gritty 1-1 draw 
against Wisconsin.
After Wisconsin’s lackluster 
offensive 
performance 
in 
the first half, Verdi was far 
more busy in the latter 45 
minutes of the match. The 
keeper had two saves, one a 
punch-out and another while 

jumping vertically. He allowed 
a goal during a 77th-minute 
Wisconsin penalty try. A late 
regulation skirmish off a corner 
kick also kept the keeper on his 
toes.
In extra time against the 
Badgers, a loose ball created 
a 
golden 
opportunity 
for 
Wisconsin to win the game, 
and upset the Wolverines in 
Ann Arbor.
Verdi had other plans.
A 
Badgers’ 
striker 
faced 
Verdi 
with 
a 
one-on-one 
chance, almost a surefire goal 
under most circumstances. 
Verdi sprawled quickly on 
all fours and got his entire 
body in front of the shot. As a 
result, the ball bounced right 
back to the Wisconsin striker, 
whose second shot was then 

denied by a strong clearance 
by senior centerback Abdou 
Samake, 
keeping 
Michigan 
alive. Unfortunately for Verdi 
and the Wolverines, the keeper 
was injured during the play.
After the game, Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley was unsure 
of the status of his injury.
“No, I don’t have any updates 
on (Verdi’s) health,” Daley said. 
“But he was excellent. He saved 
our butt down here in overtime 
with a great save and had two 
other great saves.”
Ultimately, 
the 
stalemate 
formed 
in 
regulation 
was 
never broken, and the match 
concluded in a frustrating 1-1 
draw after 110 minutes of play. 
But the draw does not tarnish 
the value and impact Verdi and 
the other seniors have had to 
the team.
“(The seniors) have had an 
interesting time here,” Daley 
said. “In their first year, we 
struggled. They’ve seen a little 
bit of adversity. They saw some 
good times in ‘17 and ‘18, and 
we’re still growing.”
Verdi 
epitomizes 
Daley’s 
description. As a sophomore, 
he started in 13 games in a 
successful campaign. His junior 
year, he didn’t see any playing 
time, as every start went to 
keeper 
Henry 
Mashburn. 
Now, in his senior season, the 
staple between the Wolverines’ 
posts has started every single 
match and has been a critical 
part of the team’s success. His 
three saves against Wisconsin 
showcased his importance to 
the team.
With Michigan approaching 
the postseason, Verdi’s injury 
status could be monumental 
to the Wolverines in their 
efforts to avenge their Big Ten 
tournament final loss from 
2018. At the moment, Daley 
is strictly focused on getting 
Verdi back on the pitch.
“I’m 
not 
worried 
about 
postseason, to be fair,” he 
said. “I’m just worried about 
if Andrew’s OK, first and 
foremost.”

Run game 
does what 
it’s good at, 
sees payoff

Ed Warinner has two kinds of outside 
zones built into his run game.
One is, essentially, the base outside 
zone you see everywhere. Everyone 
shuffles in one direction and takes 
the man in front of them. The only 
difference is, there’s a fly sweep 
attached, to get the defense moving the 
other way.
The other, what he calls a man-
scheme outside zone, is what other 
coaches call a pin-and-pull. He wants 
to create a wall by blocking down, let 
the play stretch, then let the runner 
explode through with the pullers 
creating a hole.
In 2018, as Michigan’s offense clicked 
into place throughout the season, these 
two runs helped form the basis of what 
the Wolverines did. In 2019, as things 
sputtered out over the first few weeks, 
Michigan seemed to not know what it 
wanted from its run game. 
Eventually, the Wolverines decided 
on something simple: Do what they’re 
good at.
“That’s what you try to figure out each 
year,” Warinner, Michigan’s offensive 
line coach, said last week, before the 
Wolverines lost at Penn State. “Every 
team’s different. There’s no carry over. 

You’ve got carry over players, but you 
have to establish who you are and what 
you want to do. And then you evaluate. 
At some point, you have to say, here’s 
what we’re good at.”
If there was any question as to what 
Michigan is good at before Saturday, 
there isn’t now. This was Warinner’s 
run game — outside and inside zones, 
pin-and-pulls and the rest — in full 
force, and it sprung the Wolverines for 
303 yards on the ground and a 45-14 
win over Notre Dame. They held a two-
score lead before Shea Patterson even 
had a passing yard.
“I feel like when I pulled, it was able 
to open a lot of holes,” said junior center 
Cesar Ruiz. “Running backs were able 
to make some really good reads off of it. 
I feel like that’s one thing they weren’t 
really expecting and I feel like that was 
really an advantage for us, to have them 
on the perimeter a little bit.”
“We’re bringing back some stuff that 
worked last year,” added senior guard 
Mike Onwenu. “Watching previous 
games and it’s important to bring that 
back and do what worked instead of 
trying everything else.”
Michigan 
has 
talked 
about 
establishing the run before, but had yet 
to do so in this fashion — in the rain, 
against a top-10 Notre Dame team that 
figured to be a real test. By midway 
through the first quarter, when redshirt 
freshman 
running 
back 
Hassan 
Haskins burst through the hole on an 
outside zone and galloped for 20 yards, 
hurdling a defender along the way, it 
was clear the Irish stood little chance.
Haskins ran for 149 yards, or just 
68 off his career total before Saturday. 
Alongside him, Zach Charbonnet tied a 
school record with his eighth and ninth 
rushing touchdowns as a freshman. 
There are still four games left in the 
regular season. The run game, finally, 
seems to be hitting its stride.
“Made some creases and had some 
really crisp blocks,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “The backs were 
squeezing through them and breaking 
tackles. Hit a trap play early, that was 
big. Hit another couple inside runs, 
hit a couple outside runs. (Offensive 
coordinator) Josh (Gattis) did a nice 
job with the running game, inside then 
outside. RPOs started clicking.”
And in a first-half monsoon, against a 
top-10 opponent and a rival, Harbaugh’s 
team got out to a decisive lead in the 
kind of game the program has long 
coveted winning. By the time Tru 
Wilson ran 27 yards into the end zone 
in the fourth quarter for Michigan’s 
third rushing touchdown of the night, 
the competitive portion of the game had 
long ended.
It all harkened back to Warinner’s 
message, one so simple that Gattis and 
Michigan seemed to forget it until just a 
few weeks ago. Do what you’re good at.
On Saturday, that’s what Michigan 
did.

No one on the outside knows quite 
what happened at halftime in State 
College last weekend, and those on the 
inside don’t seem too keen on sharing. 
Those are moments that can be blown 
out of proportion, anyway.
But the team that walked out of 
that locker room, staring down a 21-7 
deficit in the fire-breathing cauldron 
of Beaver Stadium, is not the same as 
the one that entered. That’s plainly 
clear.
What 
entered 
was 
an 
underwhelming offense and a mistake-
prone defense, a defeatist squad with a 
downtrodden mentality, a coach under 
a fervent national microscope and a 
program unable to escape the pressure 
of its own weight. What exited, it 
appears, is a whole different football 
team — one that came inches from 
an historic comeback last week and 
dominated No. 8 Notre Dame in every 
facet of the game this week, smacking 
the Fighting Irish, 45-14.
“I think the second half of the 
Penn State game, I thought we found 
our stride,” said senior quarterback 
Shea Patterson on Saturday. “We 
realized after that game, going into 
this week, from Monday’s practice 
that offensively we’ve got to come out 
that way start to finish. We can’t come 
out flat and expect to make a heroic 
comeback in the end.”
In 
those 
six 
quarters, 
the 
Wolverines have outgained their two 
opponents 667 to 260, out-rushed them 
379 to 60 and, most importantly, out-
scored them 66 to 21. After turning the 

ball over 13 times in the six-and-a-half 
games prior, Michigan hasn’t turned 
it over once since — against two of the 
most turnover-happy defenses in the 
country. Patterson has looked far more 
in line with his 2018 self. The defense 
has evolved into the suffocating 
menace most expected.
To put it flatly: this is a team that 
has done what it’s wanted to two top-
10 teams in a way it failed to do to a 
Conference USA foe and a Military 
Academy mere weeks prior.
“Yeah, I saw it coming,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. 
“Watching them prepare, watching 
them practice, watching the detail and 
the meetings. How important it was to 
them. Day in, day out work in practice. 
The growth, you can see it.”
The success has been rooted in 
many of the core tenants from last 
season. A coalescing offensive line has 
allowed just three sacks in the last two 
games, supplementing what’s quickly 
blossomed into a potent rushing 
attack. In a driving rain, Michigan 
racked up 57 rushing attempts, 
continuing to pound its running backs, 
daring a hapless Notre Dame side to 
stop it.
Junior Hassan Haskins tallied 149 
rushing yards on 20 carries, plowing 
through — and hopping over — the 
Fighting Irish defense.
The Wolverines stamped their 
way to 5.9 yards per carry, tossing the 
elements aside and the game to rest 
from the outset. At halftime, they’d 
run the ball 28 times and thrown it 
just four. The score, 17-0, even belied 
the feeling of finality that had already 
set in by then. Michigan won this in a 

way that left no doubt as to who was 
the better side — and as to whether 
last week’s second half was any sort of 
anomaly.
“We’re 
taking 
leaps,” 
said 
sophomore 
linebacker 
Cameron 
McGrone, a burgeoning defensive star. 
“And I believe we’ve always had it, it 
was just us clicking and, like I said, 
at Penn State, I think we really found 
what our team can do and that we can 
do it whenever we want.”
For all the positive takeaways from 
that half, though, they still cannot be 
evaluated in a vacuum. The loss to the 
Nittany Lions is still a loss, and still 
comes with all the season-altering 
ramifications. Michigan still has two 
Big Ten defeats, and will still likely be 
locked out of postseason title chances.
What to make of this team-wide 
reinvention perhaps depends on your 
own conception of success going 
forward. It’s more than fair to quibble 
that this is all too-little, too-late.
But whatever this team figured out 
in a cagey locker room in Pennsylvania 
has made a demonstrable difference. 
From here, all it can control is the 
game it’s playing.
This win was no statement. No 
boisterous journey for revenge. No 
atonement for the two losses that 
clouded the season thus far.
Just business as always intended — 
and maybe a dose of therapy.
“I just thought we needed to come 
out, start to finish, and just play,” 
Patterson said. “Play the way we know 
how to play. I think really that’s kind 
of the first time, in all cylinders, we’ve 
played our best game. And when we do 
that, we’re really hard to beat.”

Michigan’s offense broke out for 45 points on Saturday night, dominating Notre Dame, 45-14, in a rain-soaked affair at Michigan Stadium.

Defensive 
speed stifles 
Notre Dame 
attack

Cam McGrone raced toward an 
emptying student section, flexing his 
right arm then his left above his head. 
Aidan Hutchinson and Luiji Vilain 
stood to either side of McGrone, serving 
as bodyguards to his celebration. A few 
yards behind Michigan’s jubilant pass-
rushing trio, Notre Dame quarterback 
Phil Jurkovec lay face down on the 
13-yard line.
It was Jurkovec’s first play of the 
game, but as starting quarterback Ian 
Book looked on from the sidelines, the 
back of a gold helmet emerging from 
the turf provided a familiar sight. Book 
left the game early in the fourth quarter 
after an 8-for-25, 73-yard performance 
— his career low as a starter, en route to 
a 45-14 Wolverines’ win.
A year ago, when Michigan opened 
its season with a road defeat against the 
Fighting Irish, McGrone, Hutchinson 
and Vilain largely watched from afar, 
underclassmen patiently waiting their 
turn. Senior safety Josh Metellus was 
a starter that day, but he too watched 
most of the game from the locker 
room after a first-quarter ejection for 
targeting.
And for 14 months, since that 
night in South Bend, he’s known this 
performance was coming.

“The type of offense that they run, 
they try to stick to the same script, get 
the same guys the ball,” Metellus said. 
“They don’t like going outside the frame 
in the type of stuff they like to do in 
their scheme. We knew coming in they 
watched teams previously and see what 
worked against us and try to hit there.”
According to McGrone, the area that 
Notre Dame tried to exploit was the 
edge. It’s a funny thought for anyone 
who watched this year’s game, because 
“exploit” may well rank last on the list 
of verbs that could be used to describe 
what the Irish did to Michigan on the 
edge.
All evening, though, they tried — 
bouncing runs to the outside, throwing 
quick passes into the flat, scrambling 
toward the chains. And all evening, they 
failed, chased down by the Wolverines’ 
superior speed.
“(Our speed) allows everybody to be 
around the ball at all times,” McGrone 
said. “I’m pretty sure there’s multiple 
pictures of five to eight guys around the 
ball, which is kind of unheard of.”
On Saturday, that translated into just 
two sacks, but the effects permeated 
far further into Notre Dame’s offensive 
performance. For the better part of 
three quarters, the Irish’s only play 
for more than 10 yards came on a 
spectacular sideline catch from senior 
Chase Claypool. Their longest rush of 
the day went for just nine yards on a 
scramble.
Despite the lack of sacks, Book 
stood at the center of it all, desperately 
running from maize and blue jerseys, if 
only to find enough reprieve to huck a 
pass into the stands.
“Defensively, 
it 
was 
a 
great 
performance,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “We’re just so fast, we’re 
just running so good and the knockback 
in the defensive line was outstanding, 
really good coverage, linebackers were 
running.”
The result was a defensive showing 
that finally allowed the Wolverines to 
match complete performances on both 
sides of the ball. The fact that it only 
comes after two losses isn’t lost on these 
players — they know what that means 
for their Big Ten title hopes.
But for more than six quarters now, 
dating back to a near-comeback against 
Penn State last weekend, they’ve been 
the dominant team that was promised 
before the season. And at the crux of that 
is a defense that’s allowed first downs 
on just six of its last 22 possessions.
It’s why defensive coordinator Don 
Brown’s message at the end of it all was 
one of pride in a unit that McGrone said, 
“played how we know that we can play.”
It’s also why his message included a 
follow up, as McGrone relayed after the 
game:
“We still believe that our best 
football’s ahead.”
After Saturday, that’s a scary thought.

Six quarters that lifted Michigan’s season

Hassan Haskins broke free, found 
his gap and exploited it. He’d done 
this before, but this time, there was an 
encore. Haskins jumped into the air and 
over his defender, picking up a few extra 
yards in the process.
That run provided 20 of the Michigan 
football team’s 303 rushing yards of the 
night, 149 of which came courtesy of 
Haskins. But the reality was it didn’t 
really matter who got the handoff. The 
Wolverines’ offensive line mauled Notre 
Dame’s front seven, opening up gaping 
holes for Michigan to run through. On 
a night so rainy the cheerleaders played 
slip and slide in the end zone, a potent 
running game was vital.
Last year against the Irish, that run 
game was conspicuously absent. The 
Wolverines rushed for just 58 yards 
on 33 attempts en route to a 24-17 loss 
in South Bend, Ind. After promises 
of offensive line improvement under 
then-new coach Ed Warinner, that unit 
struggled, with any potential running 
holes sufficiently plugged before they 
opened. The pass protection was even 
worse, allowing three sacks and six 
quarterback hurries.
On Saturday, after Michigan got a 
shot at revenge, the situation was like 
night and day. Haskins praised his 
offensive line for opening up the gaps 
he ran through. The line’s stout play 
showed in the success of the running 
game, with 303 rushing yards the most 
the Wolverines have had this season. 
The pass protection was markedly 

better, allowing two sacks and no 
quarterback hurries.
“We expected to run the ball a lot,” 
said senior guard Michael Onwenu. 
“But a lot of holes were open, more 
so than we thought. The backs were 
shifting, a lot of motion and whatnot, so 
we expected that, but it was attacking 
the holes faster than we thought, so we 
adjusted.”
Even backup center Steven Spanellis 
got in on the action, continuing to block 
his man after both went out of bounds 
in the fourth quarter. It was a play so 
memorable that it got a shoutout from 
Charles Woodson on Twitter.
If last year’s matchup with the Irish 
was a re-affirmation of the narratives 
that have surrounded Harbaugh during 
his tenure — inability to beat rivals, 
starting slow, underperformance in big 
moments — Saturday’s 45-14 blowout 
win took those narratives and flipped 
them on their head.
“It’s a feeling that I know I’ll 
remember for — and I’m sure everybody 
in the locker room will,” said senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson. “I was just 
so happy to be a part of that and I feel 
like as a group we’re just doing great 
especially since last year left a bit of a 
sour taste. Just very proud of ourselves.”
Michigan beat the eighth-ranked 
team in the country handily. The 
offensive line played like one that 
returned four All-Big Ten starters. And 
this time, the Wolverines weren’t the 
ones that started slow.
Last year, Michigan went down 21-3 
early and spent the whole game playing 
from behind. The Wolverines scored 

two more touchdowns after that and 
made it a close game. But it’s hard to win 
like that, especially against a rival, and 
even more so against an opponent with 
Playoff aspirations of its own.
On Saturday, the Wolverines were 
the ones that went up early — leading 
17-0 at halftime. The offense did its 
part while the defense clamped down 
and dampened the Irish’s hopes of a 
comeback.
“Our problem, especially as a team — 
not just as a defense — is that we start 
slow,” said senior safety Josh Metellus. 
“We start slow and once we pick it up, 
it’s hard to stop us. Offensively, it’s hard 
to stop us, hard to put a cap on it. But 
once we started fast in that first quarter 
and we didn’t give up a first-quarter 
touchdown or any first-quarter points, 
I knew that we’d be able to hold on 
through the rest of the game.”
And in thoroughly flipping the script 
on last year’s frustrating loss, Michigan 
also gave itself a blueprint. This is how 
it can start to change those narratives. 
This is how it can beat rivals and top 
teams. This is what it’s capable of doing.
Though it’s a little too late for those 
Playoff hopes, or even a conference 
championship, the Wolverines still have 
two rivalry games left on the schedule 
— against two opponents that have left 
particularly bad tastes in their mouths 
the past five years.
With its statement against Notre 
Dame, Michigan got more than just a 
marquee win. If it can follow the path 
it forged on Saturday, it could start to 
reverse the narratives it’s struggled so 
much to escape.

4B — October 28, 2019
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
SportsMonday

KALAMAZOO — All it took 
was five minutes for Western 
Michigan to dictate a game.
Five minutes to set the pace. 
Five to dominate the ice. Five 
minutes to create a lead the 
Michigan hockey team would 
spend the remaining 55 trying to 
overcome, ultimately to no avail.
“From faceoff to forecheck, 
to getting pucks out, to getting 
pucks to the net, to getting pucks 
through,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson, “they put on a 
clinic in that first five minutes.”
And it was in those first few 
minutes that the Wolverines’ 
4-1 loss was decided. Despite 
the initial faceoff win to open 
the game, Michigan (3-2-1) was 
beat on the three following 
consecutive draws. This forced 
the pressure on the Wolverines 
to defend in their own zone, and 
unprepared for the rapid-fire 
attack, conceded a goal a minute 
into the game on a tipped pass 
high in the air.
“We weren’t ready to play,” 
Pearson said. “We talked about 
the game, about the first five 
minutes being really important, 
and (we) weren’t ready to play 
tonight. They were hungrier 
than we were at the start of the 
game, and we got in a hole.”
And that hole only got bigger 
as Western Michigan (2-3-1) 
refused to give up the pressure. 
Two minutes after letting one 
in, another was scored off 
a rebound passed out wide. 
Michigan had defended the 
initial shot, but after Strauss 
Mann pushed the puck out to his 
left, a Bronco player waited and 
reacted accordingly, shooting 
the puck past the sophomore 
goaltender.
It was a start that exemplified 
how passive the Wolverines 
had played to that point. They 
couldn’t create any offensive 
pressure, refusing to forecheck 
and were subjected to relentless 

attacks throughout the period. 
The minute they entered the 
offensive zone with the puck, 
the players were met with 
clashing sticks and poke checks, 
and simply gave the puck up.
“We just did not create much 
pressure on them for the most 
part,” Pearson said. “This was 
the most shots we’ve given up in 
back-to-back games, I’m going 
to say since I’ve been the coach 
at Michigan.
“Nobody 
wants 
to 
go 
forecheck, 
we’re 
looking 
around for somebody else to 
go forecheck or we just do one 
man and they just had two 
defensemen, they bump it to the 
other guy and then they’re out. 
We’ve just gotta look at that and 
do a better job.”
The only real threat Michigan 
posed early was from the power 
play. To end the first period, 
sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert drew a power play after 
being checked in the back. The 
team didn’t see the result of the 
man-advantage until after the 
intermission, where it looked to 
rectify its poor start. And for a 
moment, it looked like it did.
Senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood shot a wrister into 
the top-left shelf after freshman 
forward Emil Ohrwall drew the 
defense to him. He then dumped 
it off to a waiting Lockwood. 

It was a moment of relief for a 
team that had failed to compile 
any complete offensive push to 
that point.
“We got it to 2-1 as the second 
period started, and I thought 
we’d be fine,” Pearson said.
The moment of relief was 
soon 
broken 
after 
senior 
forward 
Nick 
Pastujov 
committed 
an 
interference 
penalty. 
With 
the 
man 
advantage, Western Michigan 
shot the puck from the slot, 
having it ding off the right 
post before hitting the left and 
sliding in.
“If you give them enough 
chances, if we get running 
around a little bit, they’re going 
to take advantage of that,” 
said senior defenseman Luke 
Martin. “The best penalty kill 
is no penalty kill. Stay out of 
the box. We need to do a better 
job than that and just limiting 
their chances off that.”
It was warranted advice 
after another power-play goal, 
one scored in the dying seconds 
game to further cemented how 
insurmountable 
that 
early 
deficit was.
“We’re gonna have to settle 
for some more simple plays,” 
Martin said. “And I think we 
did that as the game went 
on. But like I said, the start is 
everything.

KALAMAZOO 
— 
With 
under two minutes to go and the 
Michigan hockey team (3-2-1) 
trailing by two goals against No. 
18 
Western 
Michigan 
(2-3-1), 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Strauss 
Mann skated to his team’s bench 
to give the Wolverines an extra 
man on the attack. Soon after, the 
Broncos’ student section motioned 
toward the empty net and filled the 
rink with taunts of “better goalie.”
To say this particular frame had 
a significant impact on the final 
result is baseless. The game was 
already out of Michigan’s grasp, 
sparing late game magic. That said, 
it depicts the bigger picture of the 
night — that playing in Lawson 
Ice Arena can turn everything 
sideways.
In the week of practice leading 
up to the series the Wolverines 
were well aware Saturday night’s 
tilt could come with a challenging 
environment, some even referring 
to it as a “rowdy spot.” But that 
prior understanding didn’t prevent 
events from unfolding as they did.
It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly 
to what extent the environment 
affected the game, and that 
answer will vary greatly coming 
from spectators and Michigan 
personnel. But there was certainly 
some level of influence from the 
moment the game began. This 
appeared to startle the Wolverines, 
and they found themselves down 
two goals in the first few minutes.
“Just the slow start can impact 
the game, especially with that 
crowd,” said senior defenseman 
Luke Martin. “It’s a good home 
team. Tough place to play, but we 
take that on ourselves. If we come 
out with a better start it’s a totally 
different game.”
The crowd targeted the game 
through multiple channels. For 
instance, after Mann gave up his 
first goal the students shouted his 
name repeatedly to mess with him, 
and they did this many more times. 
This appeared to at least somewhat 

rattle him, as later in the game he 
looked shaky when collecting a 
loose puck and nearly gave up an 
easy goal.
Freshman 
defenseman 
Cam 
York was another victim, and he 
was constantly singled out when on 
the ice. When Michigan got called 
for penalties, students often yelled 
“cheater.” With the students seated 
directly behind the penalty box, 
some resorted to a more hands-
on approach. They pried at the 
corner of the box, separating the 
sheets of glass mere millimeters 
because that was enough to send 
discouraging words.
With this being the first road 
game of the season, it was the 
first time playing in such a hostile 
environment for some of the 
youngsters.
“I think they handled it really 
well,” Martin said of the youth’s 
control of the atmosphere. “But I 
don’t think we did a good enough 
job as upperclassmen showing 
them what it takes to have a good 
start, and it starts in the locker 
room.”
The Wolverines committed a 
season-high seven penalties against 
Western Michigan. Some of those 
were easily avoidable, such as when 
senior forward Will Lockwood got 
called for interference early in the 
final frame. Lockwood had been 
roughed up a bit near Michigan’s 
net, but there was no call. As the 
play went on, he skated into the 
neutral zone and elbowed a guy 
near the head. Penalties like that, 
potentially a result of the hostile 

environment, made it hard for the 
Wolverines to come back.
The intensity of the crowd 
created for an extra physical affair. 
It was the type of game where if you 
turned away for a second, you could 
look back to guys fallen down, loose 
helmets and scraps.
The crowd even got Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson’s attention. 
As he walked back onto the ice 
following the first intermission 
the students started booing, so 
he looked right at them, pumped 
his fists emphatically and pointed 
to the ‘block M’ on his sweater. 
He then stepped onto Michigan’s 
bench and took a bow toward the 
student section.
“It’s a great environment,” 
Pearson said. “I’m just trying to get 
them riled up a little bit. You could 
see they get going, and you want to 
play in this environment. I was just 
promoting Michigan to them.”
It’s unclear whether the hostile 
environment was the root cause of 
the Wolverines’ difficulties. But the 
end result indicates atmosphere 
and context matter, and Michigan 
will need to grow accustomed to 
such places for better results.
“It’s a good learning lesson for 
our team,” Pearson said. “What 
they need to do to prepare to play 
in a tough environment against a 
tough team against a good team 
and a physical game, we haven’t 
played in that kind of game like 
that yet all year, and it was on the 
edge of out of control, but you’re 
going to have to play in those 
games.”

The ball collides with the 
defenders’ arms and falls to the 
floor — point, Minnesota. The 
Crisler Center is silent for the 
first time all night. The Gophers 
win.
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
volleyball team (13-7 overall, 
6-4 Big Ten) gave up a two-set 
lead to No. 7 Minnesota (15-
3, 9-1) Friday night, losing the 
fifth set, 15-13. The close loss 
was a missed opportunity for 
Michigan in what would have 
been a statement win against a 
top 10 team as well as conference 
opponent.
The match opened up in the 
Gophers’ favor, who had the lead 
for the initial part of the first set. 
Two kills by Robinson, assisted 
by 
senior 
setter 
Mackenzie 
Welsh, tied up the set for the 
Wolverines. Afterwards, both 
teams were locked in a back and 
forth battle until the end of the 
set, which included nine lead 
changes and eight ties. Michigan 
finished off the set, 25-23 with a 
memorable play — Wetterstrom 
laid out for a dig that Welsh set 
to Robinson, who delivered a 

powerful kill in the back corner 
of the court.
The Wolverines carried the 
momentum into the second 
set, trailing only once in the 
entire set. They showed control 
throughout, operating efficiently 
on offense. They found many 
kills off of assists by Welsh to 
sophomore outside hitter Paige 
Jones. At one point, Michigan 
was siding out at 68.8 percent. 
The Wolverines took the set, 
25-23 and a comfortable 2-0 set 
lead going into the third set.
The third and fourth sets 
painted 
a 
different 
story. 
Minnesota 
came 
out 
more 
aggressively and successfully 
contained 
Wetterstrom 
and 
Jones. The Gophers increased 
their serving intensity, keeping 
the Wolverine setter on the 
run. This changed the offensive 
dynamic, causing the team to 
struggle with their passes and 
become predictable.
“Our passing numbers went 
down, their blocking numbers 
went up, and those two things 
are tied together,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “We lost a lot 
of the balance to our offense in 
the third and the fourth set.”
Other 
Michigan 
struggles 
could be attributed to the 
physicality and athleticism of 
the opposition, with Minnesota 
outside hitter Alexis Hart at the 
forefront. Hart finished Friday’s 

matchup with 20 kills and a .378 
hit percentage. 
“She was going over the block 
a lot of time,” Rosen said. “It 
creates a different dynamic.”
The Wolverines, unable to 
contain Hart’s attack, dropped 
the third and fourth sets, 21-25 
and 18-25, respectively.
The fifth set started off 
evenly, each team responding 
to 
the 
other’s 
intensity. 
Michigan went into the side 
switch leading, 8-5, after two 
Wetterstrom kills. Minnesota 
responded 
by 
winning 
six 
straight points and taking the 
lead, 
11-8. 
The 
Wolverines 
fought their way back to a 12-12 
tie after a blistering kill by 
Jones. Hart responded with her 
own attack, putting the Gophers 
up one. Jones countered with 
a block to tie the set up again 
at 13-13. A mishandled ball by 
Michigan dropped to the court. 
Match point, Minnesota. The 
Gophers took the set, 15-13, 
after Robinson was blocked, 
completing the reverse sweep.
“In the fifth set, there was 
little swings in momentum on 
both teams,” Rosen said. “It was 
a two point game in the end.”
The close loss visibly hurt the 
Wolverines. They walked off 
the court into the tunnel with 
their heads down, having to 
prepare for a bout against No. 6 
Wisconsin in just two days.
