In a race that took until 
Wednesday morning to call, 
Democratic 
challengers 
Jordan Acker and Paul Brown 
have 
unseated 
Republican 
incumbents 
Andrea 
Fischer 
Newman and Andrew Richner 
on the University of Michigan 
Board of Regents.
Acker’s main focus is on the 
affordability of attending the 
University, 
emphasizing 
the 
cost is not reflected accurately 
by tuition alone but also housing 
and other expenses. Specifically, 
Acker said he wants students to 
graduate debt-free. He also said 
he believes in making the board 
more transparent in their actions 
and more accessible to members 
of the University community. 
During the campaign, Acker 
added his perspective as a 
younger person would greatly 
benefit the current viewpoints 
of the board. Acker is an alum 
of the University and resides in 
Oakland County with his wife 
and two daughters where he 
works as a lawyer.

Several 
University 
of 
Michigan students were turned 
away from polling stations on 
Tuesday due to issues with their 
voter registration. Some students 
who used TurboVote to register 
experienced issues, while other 
students who registered with 
on-campus volunteers were also 
unable to vote.
Ann Arbor poll monitor John 
Yohdes said they had to turn 
away about five people who 
thought they were registered 
vote. Though not entirely sure 
why each person was not on 
the registration list, he said it 
is possible that students who 

experienced 
problems 
with 
TurboVote failed to send in paper 
documentation to the Michigan 
secretary of state’s office or 
city clerk’s office. Online voter 
registration is not accepted in 
the state of Michigan.
“What I think is happening is 
that those people fill it out and 
it says that they are registered,” 
Yohdes said. “At some place 
online, it says that they have to 
make a paper copy and send it 
to the secretary of state or to the 
city clerk — and that’s what they 
didn’t do. So technically, as far 
as the secretary of state or the 
city clerk are concerned, they’re 
not registered, so that’s been the 
problem, and that’s why all of 
these people have been taking 
provisional ballots.”

Schlissel to appoint commission to develop strategies in working towards carbon neutrality

Starting in 2008 and 2009, a 
wave of universities mobilized 
around the nation to aim for 
carbon-neutral campuses. The 
University of Michigan, however, 

lagged behind until early October, 
when University President Mark 
Schlissel announcedhis goal to 
set a trajectory toward carbon 
neutrality, though details of how 
and when this goal will be met 
have yet to be released. Within 
a few months, Schlissel plans to 
appoint a commission to develop 

strategies and a timeline for 
carbon neutrality.
But in October, the United 
Nations’ 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate 
Change 
also published a report that 
predicted a high probability of 
food shortages, wildfires and 
coral reef depletion by 2040. The 

warning of an imminent future 
without 
essential 
resources 
spurred many ongoing efforts at 
international, nationaland local 
levels, including at universities, 
to reaffirm their commitment to 
reduce the effects anthropogenic 
climate change.

When Students for Fair 
Admissions filed a lawsuit 
against Harvard University 
alleging that its competitive 
admissions 
process 
discriminated against Asian-
American 
students, 
the 
organization 
thrust 
itself 
into the national spotlight 
and ignited a debate about 
the 
future 
of 
affirmative 
action. 
In 
light 
of 
these 
events, 
panelists 
ranging 
from admissions officers to 
law professors gathered in the 
University of Michigan Law 
School Wednesday evening to 
discuss the ethics and legality 
of 
using 
race 
in 
college 
admissions decisions.
Event organizer Jasmine 
Wang, 
a 
Law 
student, 
opened 
the 
discussion 
by 
noting 
the 
controversy 
surrounding the lawsuit and 
the conflicting feelings many 
people 
experience 
when 
approaching 
the 
subject. 
Wang, who serves as the 
political action chair for the 
Asian Pacific American Law 
Students 
Association, 
said 
offering a legal perspective 
on affirmative action would 
dispel 
misinformation 
and 
give 
students 
a 
deeper 
understanding of the policy’s 
history.
“I think this lawsuit, SFFA 
v. Harvard, has been really 
painful for a lot of people 

in 
the 
Asian-American 
community 
and 
between 
the racial minorities,” Wang 
said. “For me, it’s more of an 
imperative to clarify what’s 
going on and hear from people 
who can be a guiding voice 
and really take control of the 
narrative.”
Though 
this 
case 
specifically 
targets 
the 
admission 
processes 
at 
Harvard, 
the 
University 

of Michigan has also been 
involved 
in 
numerous 
cases 
surrounding 
the 
constitutionality 
of 
race-
conscious admissions policies. 
In 2003, Grutter v. Bollinger 
upheld the use of affirmative 
action at the Law School in a 
5 to 4 decision. The decision 
was overturned three years 
later as a result of Proposition 
2, which prohibited racial 
discrimination in all forms 

and 
led 
to 
a 
significant 
drop 
in 
the 
number 
of 
underrepresented students at 
the University.

Business 
fifth-year 
senior 
Grant Faber is the president of 
Students for Clean Energy, a 
group of undergraduate students 
who advocate for and educate 
students on renewable energy 
around 
campus. 
Faber 
and 
his student circle are looking 

forward to the work of the 
carbon neutrality commission, 
but are urging Schlissel to 
appoint individuals who are 
committed to pursuing effective 
and timely initiatives in response 
to climate change.
“The 
success 
of 
this 
commitment 
will 
ultimately 
come down to whom President 
Schlissel appoints to the carbon 
neutrality commission, so it 
is imperative that we push for 

the proper individuals to be 
included,” Faber said.
The University was one of the 
last Big 10 schools to set carbon 
emissions goals. The current 
goal, set in 2011, aims to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions 25 
percent below 2006 levels by 
2025. In comparison, Michigan 
State University set a goal in 2009 
to reduce emissions 65 percent 
below its 2010 levels by 2030, and 
Ohio State University’s goal set 
in 2011 is to achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2050.
Concerns 
over 
the 
University’s 
lack 
of 
aggression on emissions 
reductions 
heightened 
when 
the 
University 
announced it will expand its 
central power plant, an $80 
million dollar investment 
approved 
by 
the 
U-M 
Board of Regents in March 
2017 that will facilitate the 
installation of a natural gas 
turbine. Student activists 
and environmental groups 
protested 
the 
heavy 
investment 
in 
a 
non-
renewable energy source, 
but the University contends 
the turbine would reduce 
emissions to half of its 2025 
goal.
Andrew Berki, director 
of the Office of Campus 
Sustainability, 
echoed 
this 
logic, 
emphasizing 
the transition to natural 
gas is still a step toward 
cleaner energy. As of fall 
2017, the University had 
reached 20 percent of its 
carbon emissions goal and 

the expansion would boost its 
progress to 50 percent. Berki 
also explained how Schlissel 
initiating steps toward carbon 
neutrality would be pivotal in 
efforts to take action against 
climate change.
“With the central power plant 
turbine upgrade and pursuit of a 
Power Purchase Agreement for 
renewable energy, we expect to 
reach the current goal of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions 25 
percent by 2025, which is well 
ahead of schedule,” he said. “The 
announcement 
by 
President 
Schlissel to form a commission 
tasked with developing a plan 
to put U of M on a path toward 
carbon neutrality is a major 
commitment by our institution.”
Michael 
Garfield, 
director 
of the Ecology Center, a local 
nonprofit, worked closely with 
students to think critically about 
the power plant expansion and 
explained how his work centers 
on advocating for mitigation 
initiatives in Ann Arbor and 
Detroit. According to Garfield, 25 
percent of all carbon emissions 
in Ann Arbor are generated 
by 
University 
operations. 
He 
applauded 
Schlissel’s 
commitment 
to 
carbon 
neutrality.
“The University, given how 
big an institution it is, it could 
make 
a 
dramatic 
statement 
about innovative and visionary 
approaches to address climate 
change if it takes big action,” he 
said.

VETE R ANS WE E K

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Ahmed Hamadi, Marines Corp NROTC Senior Advisor, shares his experiences as an Arab American corpsman at the Veterans Week Annual 
Veterans of Color Symposium at Hatcher Wednesday afternoon. 

Though these individuals did 
not appear on the registration 
list, they were able to fill out 
provisional ballots. In order to 
submit the provisional ballot, 
voters must complete an affidavit 
stating that he or she registered 
to vote on or before the close of 
registration for the election and 
respond to questions regarding 
his or her identity and residence.
“A lot of them will vote 
provisionally, 
which 
means 
instead of being counted it goes 
to the city clerk and the city clerk 
determines essentially what to do 
with it but there’s some technical 
things that makes me think they 
won’t be counted,” Yohdes said. 
“Some people were pretty upset 
about it and we didn’t figure out 
until about halfway through the 
day that we were getting the same 
kind of provisional votes.”
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Clerk 
Jacqueline Beaudry said “the vast 
majority” of registration issues 
she heard about were students 
who thought they had registered 
online. Many of them, Beaudry 
said, 
declined 
to 
complete 
provisional ballots.
“So, a lot of those students then, 
we were told, were unwilling 
to sign the affidavit because 
they were acknowledging they 
didn’t 
actually 
complete 
the 
registration process,” she said. 
“The 
one 
requirement 
of 
a 
provisional ballot is that you’re 
swearing that you registered to 
vote and something happened, 
whether that’s a clerical error, 
lost paperwork, but that you did 
register and we don’t have the 
record.”
Beaudry also guessed one 
reason students may have had 
trouble voting was that they were 
registered in a precinct different 
than the one they went to vote at.

In the middle of September, 
however, LSA sophomore Claire 
Ramsey registered to vote when 
an advocacy organization visited 
her political science class. She 
filled out the form, returned 
it to the group and received a 
registration card in the first week 
of October. When she arrived 
at the polls on Tuesday, the 
poll workers informed her that 
her registration card said she 
registered on Oct. 10, one day past 
the registration deadline.
“When I went today they 
said that’s the date it said I was 
registered at, but I know for a fact 
that I registered at least three or 
four weeks before that,” Ramsey 
said.
Ramsey is still unclear why she 
was not on the registration list, 
and she said she wished she was 
informed of the provisional ballot 
option.
“I didn’t even know there were 
resources 
available,” 
Ramsey 
said. “I thought the problem must 
have been on my end, so I just 
said, ‘Well that sucks’ and just 
left. I asked twice though to make 
sure there was nothing I could 
have done, they said both times 
I just had to wait until the next 
cycle.”
LSA sophomore Lanie Lott 
registered at a booth on campus 
in September, but when she 
arrived at the polls on Tuesday, 
she was told by poll workers that 
she was not registered to vote.
“I was so mad,” Lott said. “I 
really wanted to vote. I was super 
pumped about it. I filled out a 
ballot still, and I was upset about 
it. I called the clerk’s office and 
was like, explained my situation 
to them and they were like, ‘We 
don’t see your registration form, I 
don’t know what to tell you.’”
LSA 
freshman 
Madeleine 
Gannon registered to vote at a 
Michigan secretary of state stand 
outside the Michigan League in 
October. Prior to Election Day, 
Gannon wanted to check online 

to verify her registration.
“When I tried to access the 
sample ballot, I was unable 
to verify my information as a 
registered voter,” Gannon said. 
“I spent nearly an hour trying 
to verify my registration and 
journeyed into the depths of 
the secretary of state’s website 
on voter registration and the 
elections. Following my difficulty 
trying to access my status in the 
system, I immediately called 
the local clerk’s office, only to 
be told bluntly that I had never 
been registered. I then went and 
double and triple-checked the 
voter registration qualifications 
and steps listed online for eligible 
voters to try and see if I had 
missed a step.”
Though still confused, Gannon 
has thought of a few possible 
explanations as to why she was 
not registered to vote.
“The only conclusions I can 
drawn is either that (a) my form 
was lost or incorrectly filed by 
the volunteers at the registration 
stand, (b) that I had been provided 
with 
inaccurate 
information 
when I registered, resulting in 
a missing identification form, 
or that I completed the form 
incorrectly under the guidance 
of the volunteers, or (c) I turned 
18 on the 29th, and I was led to 
believe that so long as I turned 18 
before the election, I was eligible 
to register,” Gannon said.
Though 
Gannon 
said 
she 
takes some responsibility for not 
checking her registration status 
earlier, 
she 
thinks 
someone 
should have notified her if there 
was a problem.
“I think what I find most 
frustrating 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
communication,” Gannon said. 
“If my registration was filed 
incorrectly, or the forms were 
completed incorrectly, or I was 
ineligible, I never received any 
notice. I was left to assume that 
my registration would have been 
completed.”

lecturer. Molengraff explained 
one of the challenges of being 
first-generation is describing 
experiences to those who do not 
share the same identity.
“While 
not 
all 
students 
translate from one language to 
another to their family or their 
parents, I think that distinct 
significance of being first-gen 
is translating your experience 
to your family or to individuals 
who 
might 
not 
necessarily 
understand what exactly is 
happening,” Molengraff said.
Parada

of 
sharing

storytelling.

States because his stepfather 
could care for him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“To me, these things were not 
hurtful because I was a kid,” 
Parada said. “I was a young 
student who was just looking 
at the positive things in life … 
It didn’t hit me until a couple of 
years where my ex-stepfather 
and mother separated. This 
was a moment where I was 
homeless. But I knew always for 
some reason I had a great time 
at school and education was 
something that (tended) to lift 
me up.”
Parada was denied on his 
first attempt to apply to the 
University. He then attended 
Eastern Michigan University 
before 
transferring 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
his 
sophomore year.
“I still have that denial letter 
with me and it says, ‘We’re 
sorry, but we don’t want you 
here’” Parada said. “I took that 
to heart and said, ‘Okay, you’ll 
see.’ At the time, it was very 
hurtful.”
Parada 
also 
recounted 
a 
time when a professor emailed 
him after submitting an essay 
asking to speak with him about 
his writing. The professor told 
him his ideas were great, but 
that he needed to improve his 
academic composition. Parada 
said this was the first time 
he felt someone attempted to 
understand his identity. 

“This was the first time 
where I said someone was able 
to make time to listen,” Parada 
said.
Parada 
realized 
the 
experiences he faced as a first-
generation student were unique 
to him and emphasized a need 
to 
not 
homogenize 
student 
experiences and identities.
“Some 
students 
may 
not 
have grown up with planned 
vacations or famous authors 
or book titles on top of their 
heads 
or 
were 
given 
NPR 
radio stations when they were 
younger,” Parada said. “My 
question to you is when was 
the last time you assumed an 
experience of a student and how 
can you begin noticing these 
assumptions before engaging in 
those conversations?”
The symposium then broke 
into a working session on 
identifying as first-generation, 
intersecting 
identities 
and 
diverse perspectives in higher 
education.
Fred Lewis Terry, professor 
of electrical engineering and 
computer 
science, 
discussed 
concerns 
of 
overwhelming 
students with information as 
they arrive to campus.
“What 
we 
worry 
at 
orientation is we could tell you, 

‘Here’s the pathway to the pot of 
gold at the end of the rainbow,’ 
and they get so numbed out that 
it’s overwhelming,” Terry said.
Ayeza 
Siddiqi, 
assistant 
director of the Office of New 
Student Programs, emphasized 
providing more activities and 
resources 
catering 
to 
first-
generation students.
“With 
our 
freshman 
mentoring program, we’ve been 
trying to … keep the program 
more towards diverse and low-
income students and providing 
more activities and resources 
we know would be beneficial 
to them,” Siddiqi said. “We’re 
talking a lot more about these 
identities.”

SYMPOSIUM
From Page 1A

noted 
how 
the 
rhetoric 
surrounding SFFA v. Harvard 
has 
changed 
since 
2014. 
Ochi said the lawsuit, which 
was 
filed 
by 
conservative 
legal 
strategist 
Edward 
Blum, may have intended to 
eliminate affirmative action 
policies rather than combat 
discrimination directly.
“There were many claims 
in this lawsuit that were very 
targeted at affirmative action 
and only one of them, actually, 
is 
focused 
on 
intentional 
discrimination,” Ochi said. “A 
number of those claims were 
dismissed through Harvard’s 
motion to dismiss a year and 
a half ago, but nevertheless 
that was the intention of this 
lawsuit.”
Ochi 
also 
stressed 
that 
while the lawsuit may appear 
to support Asian-American 
students, its claims would 
have little to no impact on 
enrollment 
and 
admission 
rates. In fact, Ochi said the 
chances of an Asian-American 
student getting into a selective 
university would increase by 
less than one percent if all 
African-American and Latinx 
students were removed from 
the pool.
“Even if Harvard, or any 
other selective school, got 
rid of the consideration of 
race, the chances of an Asian-
American student getting into 
that school would really not 
change,” Ochi said. “I think 
that we do need to separate 
discrimination against Asian 
Americans from affirmative 
action. 
Affirmative 
action 
is not the cause of any 
discrimination 
Asian 

Americans may face.”
Panelists 
also 
discussed 
holistic admissions policies, 
which are known to give 
applicants the fairest chance 
at admission but are often 
difficult 
to 
implement 
at 
large, 
state-funded 
universities. Steven Gay, the 
assistant dean of admissions 
at the U-M Medical School, 
said he prefers to focus on 
an applicant’s experiences, 
struggles and strengths rather 
than nondescript factors like 
MCAT score or GPA.
“Holistic review is, in a 

significant way, how you’ve 
achieved 
and 
succeeded 
within context,” Gay said. 
“What did you have to go 
through, what did you have to 
work through, where did you 
have to go, how did you have 
to do it to get to that point? 
Holistic review is a means to 
get to the core values of what 
your institution stands for and 
how it wants to be a presence 
in our communities.”
In 
response 
to 
Gay’s 
argument, 
Astronomy 
professor Sally Oey said this 
type of holistic review does not 
always take implicit bias into 
account, potentially leading to 
further discrimination.
“This 
case 
is 
about 

discrimination, 
in 
fact, 
also, and it’s not just about 
affirmative action,” Oey said. 
“Those two things are very 
separate, 
as 
we’ve 
heard 
about just now. But if there is 
discrimination, it’s something 
we need to be concerned about 
and implicit bias is something 
to be concerned about as well.”
Law 
professor 
Margo 
Schlanger 
noted 
how 
a 
holistic admissions process 
can be advantageous for both 
the applicant and the school. 
Even 
so, 
Schlanger 
said 
willfully ignoring the race of 
an applicant in admissions 
does nothing to solve the issue 
of racial underrepresentation.
“It just seems that public 
universities should educate 
the public,” Schlanger said. 
“It seems to me that to fulfill 
our mission, we need to have 
people here of many different 
types, in part because we 
educate each other better that 
way and that’s good, but in 
part because it is just and it is 
right and it is our role in the 
state … If we have a coherent 
claim in justice about racial 
diversity and racial justice, 
then 
we 
should 
aim 
our 
policies at racial diversity and 
racial justice.”
Anthony 
Fowlkes, 
a 
Public Policy and Education 
graduate student, agreed with 
Schlanger’s point that “race-
neutral” admissions processes 
do not address the lack of 
diversity on college campuses.
“Color-blind is not a thing — 
it’s still a non-neutral policy,” 
Fowlkes said. “We also have to 
make sure that discrimination 
is not happening on the other 
end. Because nothing is race-
neutral, there is a chance for 
discrimination on the other 
side of that.”

to be the first Regent to have 
graduated in the 21st century,” 
Acker said. “We have a lot 
of work to do to make the 
University 
affordable 
and 
accessible so students don’t 
have to go deep into debt. 
Finally, 
I 
wanted 
to 
say 
congrats to Paul on his victory 
and a thank you to Regents 
Newman and Richner for 
their years of service to the 
University that we all love.”
Brown’s priorities include 
setting new standards for 
ethics and transparency in 
the board, creating a plan to 
rebate surplus tuition money 
to students and significantly 
expanding 
the 
University’s 
affordability 
initiatives. 
Brown’s 
campaign 
has 
emphasized his experience as 
a union member and a board 
member of the Huron Valley 
Area Labor Federation, as he 
is the only candidate with 
experience as a union member. 
This is his second campaign 
for a spot on the board — he 
ran in 2010 and came in third 
in 
the 
statewide 
election. 
Brown holds an undergraduate 
degree and an M.B.A. from 
the University as well as a 
law degree from Wayne State 
University. He lives in Ann 

Arbor with his wife and two 
children.
“The most important thing I 
want to express is that Andrea 
Fischer Newman and Andrew 
Richner have been incredible 
public 
servants 
for 
the 
University, totally dedicated to 
the University and its students 
and its success and Andrea 
deserves to be on the Mount 
Rushmore of U of M Regents 
history,” Brown said. “I am 
excited to join the Board and 
continue the great legacy. The 
University of Michigan is the 
best research university in the 
world but I want to bring it back 
to being the leader and best 
and that’s particular in cost of 
both education and health care 
as well as diversity.”
In a press release sent out 
Tuesday morning, Newman 
conceded the election and said 
she has high hopes for the new 
Board.
“I am eternally grateful to 
the people of this great state 
for granting me the honor of 
serving on the University of 
Michigan Board of Regents 
for 24 years,” Newman wrote. 
“Together we fought to keep 
tuition low and standards high. 
We grew the endowment. We 
grew the campus.

But if there is 
discrimination, 
it’s something 
we need to be 
concerned about


A

s 
alumni 
of 
the 
University of Michigan, 
we 
were 
deeply 
disappointed by the recent 
actions of two instructors who 
refused to support students’ 
desire to study abroad in 
Israel. While we applaud the 
University 
for 
disciplining 
Prof. John Cheney-Lippold, 
we are concerned that the 
campus climate is undergoing 
a 
dangerous 
trend 
toward 
restricting academic freedom 
and 
unfairly 
singling 
out 
students 
who 
pursue 
educational 
opportunities 
involving Israel.
The 
recent 
actions 
of 
Cheney-Lippold 
and 
Lucy 
Peterson, 
a 
graduate 
student 
instructor 
who 
similarly 
refused 
a 
letter 
of 
recommendation 
to 
an 
undergraduate student, are not 
isolated incidents. During a 
mandatory lecture for U-M art 
students, a speaker displayed 
two 
anti-Semitic 
images 
— 
one 
likening 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler 
and another depicting Jews 
as pigs drinking money from 
a bottle. Such dehumanizing 
imagery and hateful rhetoric 
have 
repeatedly 
led 
to 
violence 
against 
Jewish 
communities 
and 
have 
no 
place on campus. The timing 
of the presentation and denial 
of letters of recommendation 
is alarming to us and leads us 
to believe that more must be 
done to ensure a safe learning 
environment 
for 
students 
and protect the University’s 
academic integrity.
By refusing to pen letters 
of recommendation for Israel-
bound U-M students, Cheney-
Lippold 
and 
Peterson 
are 
allowing their personal beliefs 
to interfere with and obstruct 
students’ educational goals. 
Not only should Peterson be 
similarly disciplined for her 
refusal, but the University 
must strengthen its policies to 
ensure that faculty members 
and instructors will prioritize 

support 
for 
students 
over 
personal political agendas.
A recent piece by other 
U-M 
alumni, 
published 
in 
these 
pages, 
misguidedly 
alleges that the University 
is “weaponizing” letters of 
recommendation by punishing 
professors 
who 
pick 
and 
choose 
when 
to 
support 
students 
based 
on 
their 
political views. In fact, it is 
the 
instructors 
themselves 
who are weaponizing such 

letters to promote a campaign 
that violates the academic 
freedom of Israeli scholars 
and 
U-M 
students. 
While 
professors should be able to 
decide whether or not to write 
a letter of recommendation for 
their students, that decision 
should be based on academic 
merit and not political bias.
Academic 
boycotts 
of 
Israel in general demonstrate 
peak 
hypocrisy 
for 
those 
claiming to support academic 
freedom. The free exchange 
of ideas is central to the 
University’s mission and has 
been a proud tradition for 
two centuries. Trying to shut 
down engagement with Israeli 
universities 
— 
routinely 
ranked among the best in 
the world — unjustly limits 
educational opportunities for 
students at the University and 
beyond.
Even more alarming are 
the 
reports 
that 
Cheney-
Lippold used his power as 
a professor to promote the 
Boycott, 
Divestment 
and 
Sanctions movement against 

Israel 
during 
classes 
that 
are completely unrelated to 
the 
subject. 
BDS 
unfairly 
singles out Israeli businesses 
and supporters, seeking to 
isolate the state of Israel via 
international and economic 
pressure. It is very concerning 
that a movement rooted in 
anti-Semitism and extremism 
has not only made its way 
into the classroom at the 
University, but that it has 
directly 
affected 
students’ 
ability 
to 
pursue 
higher 
education. As Interim Dean 
Elizabeth Cole wrote, Cheney 
failed in his responsibility to 
teach students material related 
to his field of expertise.
Thankfully, 
opposition 
to BDS has always been the 
policy 
of 
the 
University’s 
administration. 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
recent statement that “the 
academic aspirations of our 
students — and their academic 
freedom — are fundamental to 
the University of Michigan, 
and our teaching and research 
missions,” 
gives 
us 
hope 
that 
the 
University 
will 
prevent bias and propaganda 
from damaging the student 
experience. 
However, 
the 
administration must continue 
to make it clear that it will not 
tolerate abuses of power by 
biased instructors.
As U-M students, we were 
proud to attend a university 
that supported our academic 
endeavors, regardless of our 
own opinions or individual 
pursuits. 
As 
a 
growing 
coalition of Michigan U-M 
alumni and parents who are 
members of Alums for Campus 
Fairness, we hope campus 
leaders continue to speak out 
and act against hatred and 
bias that affect Michigan U-M 
students’ ability to maximize 
their academic potential.

“Y

ou’re supposed to 
make more of what 
you wish you saw — 
what’s missing from the 
visual art conversation 
in this moment,” Pat 
Perry, the artist of the 
new mural on the North 
side of Grizzly Peak on 
South Ashley Street, 
said in an interview 
with the Daily. The 
painting adds value to 
downtown Ann Arbor, 
a value that is explained 
better with walls than 
words.
Public art is anything that 
enhances our environment by 
breaking the pattern of blandness 
and is a resource that is freely 
accessible. Public art is a sign of the 
times, reflecting neighborhoods’ 
histories 
and 
cultures 
while 
simultaneously recording them. 
Most simply, public art adorns 
blank community spaces with 
colorful conversation starters.
“We can’t wonder why people 
feel gray when gray is all people 
see,” Perry argued. Public art 
makes us unconsciously conscious 
of beauty.
The Ann Arbor Art Center, 
on behalf of local real estate 
development company 3 Mission, 
commissioned Perry to promote 
public art experiences as part of 
their new Art in Public initiative. 
The downtown space, previously 
overwhelmed with faded brick 
and chipped paint, now depicts 
a scenic Michigan landscape as 
a backdrop for a man watching 
an incoming storm. Perry rejects 
a 
didactic 
narrative—I 
asked 
and it is not a self-portrait—and 
intentionally leaves the message 
open for us to interpret using our 
own perspectives.
“Part of the idea is that (the 
Ann Arbor Art Center) wanted 
something accessible, universal 
and something that encourages 
more public art; something for 
people that aren’t proactively 
consuming contemporary art on a 
regular basis” Perry said.
This is how art in a public space 
differs from art on canvas; it’s seen 
by everyone, not just by those with 
a pre-existing interest in the arts.
“People that are taking the 

bus, driving by to work, in the 
bank across the street. Making 
something accessible to them 
means a lot to me,” 
Perry reflected. 
A mural’s design 
warrants 
careful 
consideration. 
With 
no way of ensuring 
that his message will 
resonate 
positively 
with 
everybody, 
Perry 
reflected 
extensively on how 
his experiences varied 
from those of the Ann 
Arbor folk who would eventually 
view his work. He had been 
wanting to paint his home state’s 
scenery for quite a while and 
decided on a meditative landscape 
to see how something outside of 
political topics would be received.
In Ann Arbor, one can spend a 

whole day and, without spending a 
dollar, enjoy the countless displays 
of art in the public realm. On East 
Liberty Street, a there’s an alley 
of graffiti that lets artists leave 
their mark. At the end of October, 
international 
art 
movement 
“Literature vs. Traffic” paved 
part of East Liberty street with 
thousands of discarded books 
and light displays. On Saturdays, 
Western Michigan student Ahmid 
plays 
classical 
saxophone 
on 
the corner of East Liberty and 
Maynard streets. He will continue 
to play until his fingers can no 
longer stand the winter weather.
Perry hopes the new painting 
will encourage an art trend in Ann 
Arbor and recognized Detroit has 
already caught wind of the creative 
movement. Through community 
programs like Summer in the 
City Detroit, art is being skillfully 
sowed in the community’s roots. 

Established in 2002, the volunteer 
program 
gathers 
locals 
and 
assembles activities — themed play, 
plant or paint — where volunteers 
run daycares, plant gardens or 
paint murals.
Alexandra Isabel, a returning 
volunteer in the paint division, 
painted flowers on a shipping 
container, 
repurposing 
the 
eyesore into a shed for the local 
garden. She talks about her 
summers in Detroit with pride 
and sports her Converse that 
got covered in paint drips just as 
boldly as the brick walls in Detroit 
flaunt their murals. According to 
Isabel, buildings volunteer their 
space and sponsors provide the 
paint.
“(The murals) are for everyone. 
Yes, the ones at schools are mostly 
for kids, but if walls are painted, 
they won’t get graffitied. A blank 
wall is going to get tagged,” Isabel 
said.
Alexandra’s energy in Detroit 
is manifesting across the country, 
as reflected by efforts in St. Louis 
and Charleston, W.Va., to keep 
the growing cities vibrant and 
dynamic and make them more 
unique places to live.
Public displays of art are 
often 
symbols 
that 
represent 
inarticuable 
messages. 
Art 
has a fundamental grip that 
holds us all together, allowing 
movements 
to 
unfold 
across 
countries and languages. Love 
is in the Bin, better known as 
Banksy’s shredded Balloon Girl 
epitomizes the artist’s intended 
satire in London. Meanwhile, in 
Sulaymaniyah, Iraq, our very own 
Pat Perry worked with refugees to 
paint flags of peace and tolerance. 
He’ll be returning to the Middle 
East this spring.
Throughout 
our 
entire 
conversation about his mural, 
Perry 
only 
mentioned 
one 
complaint 
about 
the 
project: 
“It was very cold when I was 
painting.”
Daylight 
savings 
gave 
us 
an extra hour. Use it wisely, 
appreciate art. As a friendly 
reminder, you do need permission 
to paint in a public space.

hen 
students 
arrive 
at 
The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
there’s 
an inherent uncertainty on what 
behaviors and activities will be 
accepted. After all, we take students 
from all over the world, inculcated 
with different cultural idiosyncrasies 
and moral values. For half of my life 
(from kindergarten through eighth 
grade) I went to a traditional, all-
boys school. We were taught the 
values of hard work, competition and 
working through adversity to achieve 
excellence. Conformity to a commonly 
held ideal of success was imperative. 
There were many times, specifically 
in athletics, when the goal was to 
break us down as individuals so that 
we could build ourselves up again as a 
unit. Every afternoon in the gym, my 
pain and needs as an individual were 
subordinate to the wellness of the 
collective, and in this way, we would 
all persevere and take pride in our 
achievements, not because they were 
handed to us, but because we had to 
sweat and scrape to get them. The 
winner received a trophy, and everyone 
else was told to work harder next time. 
Living a life of relative comfort as a 
boy from New York City, this was an 
important lesson for my youth.
Then for high school I attended one 
of the most progressive schools in the 
country, where the ultimate values were 
acceptance and inclusivity. For over a 
century, the school had emphasized the 
importance of making students feel safe 
and accepted regardless of personal 
identifiers like race, sexuality and 
gender, and challenged those within 
the loosely defined class of power to 
self-reflect on the privileges life had 
given them. The institution focused 
on uplifting those dispossessed by the 
hierarchies of society. Trophies, even 
in athletics, were rarely distributed to 
insulate people from exclusion. Every 
individual, especially one who had 
been dispossessed, was celebrated, 
and creativity and individualism were 
rewarded.
When I arrived on campus at 
Michigan, I tried to reconcile these 
two philosophies in my mind. Should 
institutions here compel individuals to 
compete and create exclusive groups 
of some ideal of what is best or should 
they accept everyone and do away with 
hierarchical value? Should they treat 
individuals as acceptable and special 
the way they are or should they obligate 
them to conform to the morals of a 
different creed?
I began reading about these 
systems that many scholars delineated 
as moral relativism versus moral 
absolutism or moral injunction. From 
my understanding, moral relativism 
applied at its extremes dictates that 
everything is exactly the same and 
because no single thing is superior to 
anything else, nothing has value. By 
contrast, when moral absolutism is 
applied at its extremes, there’s only 
one way to have value and anything 
that deviates from that has zero value. 
There’s obviously something lacking 
in both of these systems. But could 
they work together? Could students 
at the University have an experience 
marked by both fierce competition 
and adversity and also inclusivity and 
acceptance? I set off across campus 
to discover how my university could 
answer these questions.
During Welcome Week, I interacted 
with Greek life, a collection of 

organizations leaning towards moral 
absolutism. By their very definition, 
these 
fraternities 
and 
sororities 
are exclusive groups comprised of 
individuals who had in some way or 
another demonstrated value to those 
who judged them and therefore had 
been selected to join. Implicit in this 
process was the reality that many 
people who attempted to join their 
ranks would be excluded. These 
weren’t organizations for everyone. 
After rushing to demonstrate your 
worth and then pledging to prove 
that worth, you would be accepted 
into a brotherhood or sisterhood, but 
until that day, you were tasked with 
meeting their definition of value. To 
some degree, you must conform to 
their ideals of what makes a proper 
person, and you must sacrifice time 
and comfort for the betterment of the 
group. That is Greek life.
The outsiders of these groups had 
their own opinions of this philosophy. 
I was reminded of the stereotype of the 
archetypal “frat bro.” But the people 
I met couldn’t be further from this. I 
met girls and guys from Greek life who 
were passionate, determined, social, 
intelligent, diverse and aspirational. We 
discussed their futures in the worlds of 
everything from art to medical biology, 
and their hopes to bring awareness 
to charities that dealt with issues like 
domestic violence and breast cancer. 
Where were the knuckle-dragging 
hedonists bent on casual racism 
and sexism? Where were the beer 
chugging degenerates blowing dad’s 
trust fund? These caricatures were 
not my experience of Greek life at the 
University. What I realized is that no 
matter how devoutly I conformed, I 
could still serve my personal values 
from within the collective. Once 
inducted, you have the opportunity 
to carve out your own identity and 
integrate your individualistic features 
into the group. It’ll take courage and the 
convincing of others, but that might be 
exactly what the collective needs. So 
although many perceive fraternities 
as oriented only towards moral 
absolutism, there’s a lot more moral 
relativism that one might expect. 
But what about the University’s 
institutions leaning entirely towards 
moral relativism? These have become 
a part of my daily life at Michigan as 
well. In my learning community and 
extracurricular clubs, I am reminded 
of the core values of my high school: 
acceptance and inclusivity. I hear the 
perspectives of people who would 
have been historically dispossessed by 
the hierarchies of society, and I have 
the opportunity to see their worth as 
individuals and the tremendous value 
they bring to the University and to the 
community. Again, stereotypes here 
strayed from reality. I haven’t found 
any irrational social justice warriors 
or dogmatic activists lecturing people 
on not being “woke” enough. Instead, 
I met thinkers who have sculpted 
harmonious futures through their 
ideas and strived for compromise, not 
authoritarianism. These institutions 
celebrate the individual and favor 
creativity to conformity. They help 
me play on my strengths as a writer 
and personalize the experience of a 
large, potentially generic university 
into an intimate community. These 
institutions 
approaching 
moral 
relativism present the axiom that 
every person should be able to 
voice their ideas, a truth University 

students are entitled to as humans 
as much as they are as Americans. 
Furthemore, I find myself realizing 
aspects of life and my experiences 
that I might have droned out had I 
conformed entirely to the one value 
system. I had a conversation with 
a friend from my floor about his 
experiences as an immigrant to the 
United States, and the challenges 
that this new life presented. With my 
friend’s roommate, I sat by a window 
and discussed the pros and cons of 
societal concepts like participation 
trophies and safe spaces. It’s a 
good thing that we’re becoming 
more accepting as a country and 
as a society, but what are the costs? 
In the future, with the advent of 
experiential technology, will people 
insulate themselves from adversity 
altogether and reject concepts of 
moral absolutism: this is right and 
this is wrong?
I soon realized, however, that 
these institutions aren’t without 
their moral absolutist practices. 
Many living-learning communities 
at Michigan are accessed only 
through an application process in 
which many are judged against 
the value hierarchies of artistic 
talent or academic achievement, 
and are turned away. How could 
an institution of acceptance and 
inclusivity exclude someone? These 
communities know that just as 
in nature, in order for there to be 
value, there has to be selection. 
An unpleasant reality of life is that 
sometimes individuals must be 
excluded so that the collective can 
define value. So while many assess 
university-sponsored 
institutions 
like learning communities as moral 
relevatist, there’s still a great degree 
of moral absolutism required to 
create something of value.
Once I had a footing in each of 
these institutions and understood 
the 
moral 
philosophies 
they 
represented, I realized these groups 
shared more in common than I had 
initially believed. I could challenge 
myself with struggle and sacrifice, 
fit into a greater idea, and shed 
my personal comforts in favor 
of the collective, but I could also 
question these institutions, reject 
conformities that I found unbefitting 
of good character, and interact 
with those who many institutions 
would dispossess because of rather 
arbitrary criteria. It drew me back to 
the contrasting philosophies of my 
middle school and my high school, 
the values of discipline and structure 
but also creativity and individuality. 
I realized the University presents us 
with both of these experiences, and 
in engaging with both, an individual 
can prepare themselves for a life 
of success. I’m beyond happy that 
I have had the opportunity to 
integrate both of these philosophies 
into my life. I was challenged but 
also accepted. I sacrificed but also 
enjoyed. I was reminded of my 
individuality as an American, and 
of the brilliance and privilege of a 
University of Michigan education 
that offers us this dichotomy of 
thought. This, beyond any idea 
previously discovered, excited me 
about the future of my freshman 
year here at the University.

Partridge shares mixed reviews of special teams

There is plenty to be said 
about the Rutgers football team, 
but poor kickoff coverage is not 
one of them.
Jim Harbaugh made sure to 
note that — unprompted — during 
his Monday press conference. 
And if a 39.5-point spread is any 
indication, we could see plenty 
of the Scarlet Knights’ special 
teams on the field this Saturday. 
Harbaugh may have flattered the 
Big Ten basement dwellers in a 
serious tone, but the jestful aura 
of his words was louder.
Nonetheless, Harbaugh wasn’t 
wrong. Rutgers is second in the 
country, allowing just 14.9 return 
yards per kickoff, and is 34th in 
yards allowed per punt return. 
This weekend may just be more 
scout work for Michigan, but the 
spotlight is now positioned on 
what special teams coach Chris 
Partridge and his unit will do.
It seems easy enough. Both 
Ambry Thomas and Donovan 
Peoples-Jones rank in the top-
25 nationally in kick and punt 
return yards, respectively. But 
Partridge 
isn’t 
particularly 
concerned with that part of 
things. He is frustrated with 
other aspects of his special 
teams group.
“There’s a concern about that 
whole unit. I mean, we dropped 
the snap, our left end decided 
to not block the one last week,” 
Partridge said, referring to a 
blocked field goal against Penn 
State. “That’s a whole unit 
deal. (Kicker) Quinn (Nordin) 
starts it, he’s the head of it, but 
that’s a concern for sure. That’s 
something that we put in time in 
a lot and a lot more recently.
“... Gotta get it fixed or get 
someone that’s not gonna make 
the mistake in there.”
Nordin has also converted 
just three of his past seven 
kicks, and would have to make 
eight in a row to match his 
conversion percentage from last 
season. Blocked field goals can 
be anomalies, but the leash on 
Nordin’s starting spot is still 
getting shorter. Partridge noted 
that freshman Jake Moody is the 
backup, should Nordin lose his 

job.
“It 
is 
unfair 
(to 
blame 
Nordin),” Partridge said. “But 
at the same time, he’s gotta 
be better and take control of 
that thing. There’s a bunch of 
different factors that go into 
that.”
In 
terms 
of 
kickoff coverage, 
Partridge 
and 
Harbaugh 
both 
shared 
their 
pleasure in that 
area.
“This 
past 
game, the two 
stars were Ben 
Mason 
and 
Tyler Cochran,” 
Harbaugh said. “... There’s others 
that are playing really well, but 
those two are really a force. 
With Ben Mason puncturing and 
Tyler Cochran cutting the field 
in half, been very good.”
Harbaugh 
was 
specifically 
referring to two plays from 
Mason, one of which that even 
garnered Twitter virality. On 
one kickoff, Mason shed three 

Nittany Lions blockers to tackle 
returner KJ Hamler at Penn 
State’s own 17-yard line.
On 
another, 
following 
a 
kickoff that sailed out of bounds 
off Moody’s leg, Penn State 
coach James Franklin made the 
confounding 
decision to re-do 
the play instead 
of 
taking 
the 
ball at its own 
35-yard 
line. 
Needless 
to 
say, it was not 
successful, 
as 
Hamler returned 
the ball just to 
the 23.
“I know on 
their side, it’s like ‘Alright, we 
have a great kick returner and 
they just sprinted down the field 
so maybe they’ll be a little tired. 
Let’s try to get them to re-kick 
it,’ ” Partridge said. “And we 
covered that.”
Variability 
in 
the 
special 
teams’ 
performance 
has 
primarily been limited to kickoff 
coverage and field goal kicking. 

With Thomas and Peoples-Jones 
highlighting the return teams, 
the Wolverines have been on an 
ascending trajectory.
Last 
Saturday 
that 
was 
especially 
apparent, 
with 
Peoples-Jones 
breaking 
off 
two lengthy punt returns and 
Thomas nearly taking one into 
the red zone if not for a block in 
the back call — one that Partridge 
didn’t take kindly to.
“I don’t know how much 
you can fix the kick return 
last week,” Partridge said. “If 
kicking someone’s butt is a 
penalty nowadays, then sure. 
But (Josh Ross) didn’t grab, he 
didn’t hold. He pancaked a guy 
and they called a flag. … That 
was frustrating because you 
take away a great moment away 
from a unit, and from a player a 
60-yard return.”
Against 
a 
stout 
Rutgers 
coverage 
team, 
great 
field 
position and return touchdowns 
may be hard to produce. But 
advantages in every other facet 
of the game would tell you that 
Michigan won’t need either.

Junior kicker Quinn Nordin had a blocked field goal on Saturday and has only converted three of his past seven kicks.

‘M’ struggles to find rhythm in loss to Maryland

As 
the 
No. 
15 
Michigan 
volleyball team took the court 
for its match against Maryland, 
fans could sense the importance 
of the game. The Wolverines 
were hoping to repeat their win 
against 
Wisconsin 
last 
week 
following the preceding three-
game losing streak. After a season 
characterized by injuries, this 
game had crucial implications for 
Michigan’s postseason aspirations.
After the first serve, fans’ hearts 
soared as the Wolverines scored 
first. With servers constantly 
rotating, no team was able to 
score two consecutive points until 
halfway through the first set. 
An early lead was procured by 
Maryland (16-11 overall, 7-8 Big 
Ten) over Michigan (19-7, 8-7) for 
a score of 25-20 at the end of the 
set. The Terrapins maintained this 
momentum throughout the game, 
sweeping the Wolverines, 3-0.
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
attributed the loss of the first set to 
weak defense and a lack of urgency 
from the players.
“I don’t think we passed well 
in the first set,” Rosen said. “But 
I honestly think the tone was 
set, in the very first set, with our 
defensive effort. We didn’t make 
good effort after balls, we were 
letting them get soft kills. That to 
me looks like a team that expects it 
just to happen versus going to make 
things happen, and I think what 
was happening was it sets this tone 
where things weren’t going right 
for us, and we get a little frustrated 
and they get momentum.”
This lack of energy on the 
court was felt by others, including 
senior libero Jenna Lerg, who felt 
that Michigan needed to play less 
sluggish.
“As a team, every single person 
needs to play consistently and 
needs to play hard on every single 
play and every single touch,” 
Lerg said. “Right now, I think not 
everyone is committed to that 
game plan, so it’s really a mindset 
because we know we can play as 
well as we have before, like we 

did three days ago at Wisconsin. 
Really buying into that mindset 
and believing you can play that 
well.”
One 
dominating 
force 
throughout 
the 
match 
was 
freshman outside hitter Paige 
Jones. With a total of 37 kills, Jones 
was tied on the most attempted 
kills for the Wolverines’ roster. 
Jones, in the midst of an extremely 
strong first season, currently ranks 
second on the team with 3.33 kills 
per set.
Jones isn’t the only freshman 
who 
shined 
on 
the 
court 
Wednesday night. Freshman setter 
Erin O’Leary made her collegiate 
debut when she was subbed in 
for junior MacKenzi Welsh in the 
second set.
“I think she’s a very tactical 
setter,” Rosen said. “She makes 
very good decisions. I thought 
she brought a great personality. 
They tried to go over the top of her 

because she’s a little bit smaller 
block but not one time did she hurt 
us in blocking, and I just thought 
she did a really good job.
“The tough thing is I don’t 
think her location was great, but 
it’s her first match she’s played 
collegiately. She’s coming in with 
us being in a tough position being 
down, and so that’s a really hard 
position to be thrown into, and I 
thought she did an outstanding 
job.”
Putting O’Leary in the game, 
combined with a timeout in the 
middle of the second set, ushered 
in a change of momentum for the 
Wolverines.
“I think they probably had a 
really good scout on us because 
it seemed everywhere we set the 
ball, there was a double block,” 
Lerg said. “I think once we got into 
the set we started setting other 
people and opening up some gaps 
and playing harder on defense 

which helped a lot.”
Michigan finally began gaining 
ground in the second set, coming 
back from a six-point deficit and 
leading to a 25-25 tie. Fans got 
to their feet as the score rose to 
28-28. Just as it looked like the 
Wolverines 
were 
primed 
for 
a strong comeback, Maryland 
outside hitter Erika Pritchard 
came in to finish of the set for the 
Terrapins, 30-28.
After a third set which closely 
mirrored the first, Michigan is 
focusing on getting ready for its 
match against Nebraska next 
week. 
“I think we can do a better job 
with every single person ready and 
excited to go in the match even if 
you aren’t in a starting role,” Lerg 
said. “To get a chance to play and 
get the chance to succeed in a Big 
Ten (match) is really exciting and 
I hope we can continue to take that 
opportunity and run with it.”

Defensive line depth 
anchoring defense

In 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
line meeting room, there are 
boards. One lists Wolverines 
who made the All-Big Ten 
team on the defensive line two 
years ago. Another lists last 
year’s honorees.
“And then there’s another 
board,” defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison said Wednesday, 
“that has skeletons of people 
saying ‘Who’s going to be in 
this group?’ ”
The 
message 
certainly 
speaks to the inevitability of 
such top-level talent arising. 
Last year, Maurice Hurst, 
Rashan 
Gary 
and 
Chase 
Winovich 
made 
the 
cut. 
Two years ago, it was Taco 
Charlton, Chris Wormley and 
Ryan Glasgow.
“We 
talk 
about, 
at 
Michigan, 
if 
you’re 
going 
to 
play 
on 
defensive 
line 
at 
Michigan, 
you better play 
it up to here,” 
Mattison 
said. 
“Now, 
all 
of 
a sudden this 
group is doing 
that.” 
With 47 years of coaching 
experience under his belt, 
Mattison can say that with 
sincerity and credibility. It 
conveys the sheer volume of 
top-tier 
talent 
Michigan’s 
defenses 
have 
consistently 
produced. More broadly, it’s 
a telling sign of the depth the 
Wolverines’ front regularly 
rolls out.
This year, that depth is 
anchoring 
the 
top-ranked 
defense in the nation, from 
the top down. Seven defensive 
linemen have registered at 
least half a sack. Eight have 
double-digit tackles on the 
season.
When star junior defensive 
end 
Rashan 
Gary 
hurt 
his 
shoulder 
last 
month, 
sophomore Kwity Paye and 
junior Josh Uche were called 
upon to fill in. In the first 
game 
without 
Gary, 
they 
notched 
two 
sacks 
apiece. 
Wednesday, 
Mattison lauded 
Paye 
for 
his 
aptitude 
at 
multiple 
spots 
along the line.
“(He’s) 
very 
versatile,” 
Mattison 
said. 
“He’s an anchor. He played 
anchor behind Rashan. He 
also will be the first guy to 
backup 
(fifth-year 
senior) 
Chase 
Winovich 
in 
some 
of the packages that coach 
(Don) Brown puts together. 
He’s a guy that can do a lot of 
different things because he’s 
intelligent and really fast.”
Uche, for his part, currently 
leads the team with seven 
sacks in just 63 pass-rush 
snaps, 
per 
a 
Michigan 
spokesperson, good for an 11 
percent sack rate. If that was 
an official NCAA statistic, it’s 
hard to imagine anyone in the 
country would top him in the 

category. Uche’s development 
has added yet another layer to 
the defense, and allowed the 
junior to blossom into a bona 
fide pass-rushing star in his 
specialized role.
“He’s 
a 
pass-rush 
technician,” 
said 
Uche’s 
roommate, 
junior 
VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson. “I knew 
that before. I just see all 
the work he’s been putting 
in. I’m not surprised at all. 
… He’s unblockable. To me, 
unblockable. I don’t think 
anybody can block him. That’s 
just what feel. It’s what I 
know.”
Gary’s return has allowed 
Mattison to experiment with 
different 
combinations. 
He 
sees the excess of riches as 
an 
opportunity 
to 
rotate 
advantageously. In the third 
down passing packages, Paye 
frequently 
lines up with 
Winovich, 
Uche 
and 
sophomore 
Michael 
Dwumfour 
to 
maximize 
speed. 
Gary, 
now 
back 
to 
full 
health, 
will 
start 
getting 
those 
snaps, too.
Michigan 
currently 
sits 
seventh 
in 
the 
nation 
in 
third down defense, allowing 
conversions 
on 
just 
27.7 
percent of third downs. Last 
week, Penn State converted 
just 2-of-11 such attempts. The 
game before, Michigan State 
failed to convert any of its 12 
attempts. 
That 
Wolverines’ 
defensive line has certainly 
earned a bulk of the credit.
“If you know it’s a passing 
situation, you’re better with 
speed. We happen to have guys 
that are faster than others,” 
Mattison said. “The other 
thing that that does, we have 
a lot of talent. It keeps guys 
involved in the game.”
The interior of the defensive 
line has weathered injuries to 
sophomore Aubrey Solomon 
and junior Michael Duwmfour, 
with 
fifth-year 
senior 
Lawrence 
Marshall 
and 
junior 
Carlo 
Kemp filling in 
seamlessly.
“We 
have 
a 
starting 
first unit and 
a 
rotating 
first unit and 
a 
rotating 
second 
unit. 
All of them are 
starters. Lawrence Marshall, 
if you asked me, he’s a starter. 
The guy who happens to be 
playing very, very strong for 
us in there is Carlo Kemp,” 
Mattison said. “Anyone who 
goes in that game should be, in 
your mind, a starter.”
That begs the interminable 
question that lines the board 
in the defensive line room. 
“Who’s going to be next?”
Winovich — who was a 
tight end just a few years ago 
— seems destined for All-Big 
Ten honors this year. Perhaps 
Uche, too, at this rate.
But the evergreen answer? 
Always someone.

“There’s a 
concern about 
that whole 
unit.”

Amine dominates matches 
at NWCA All-Star Classic

Myles Amine emerged from 
the tunnel and was met with a 
reception fit for the final bout 
at the NCAA Championships. 
The redshirt junior trotted 
out to the mat elevated by the 
cheers of the raucous crowd and 
the spirit of the event. Flames 
shot into the air on either side 
of him. He came prepared and 
ready to dominate.
And on Friday at the NWCA 
All-Star Classic, that’s exactly 
what he did.
Facing off against a fellow 
All-American, Amine cruised 
to 
an 
11-2, 
major-decision 
victory over the 10th-ranked 
Jacobe Smith of Oklahoma 
State.
Due to the high ranking of 
both wrestlers and the 1,000-
plus people eagerly watching 
match after match, the non-
scoring invitational felt like 
it was for all the marbles. 
And 
with 
his 
dominant 
performance, Amine showed 
his game is already nearing 
postseason form.
Despite not having previously 
wrestled 
Smith, 
Amine 
stayed true to 
character 
and 
used a vicious 
offensive 
onslaught 
to 
keep 
his 
opponent 
on 
his 
heels 
and 
continue 
to 
tack points on 
the scoreboard. 
In the victory, Amine mixed 
his unparalleled conditioning 
with unique attack angles to 
confound Smith and earn the 
major decision.
From last season to the early 
moments of this one, Amine’s 
matches have become almost 
formulaic. 
The 
opponent 
manages to keep the match 
close, even scoreless, through 
one period. But then fatigue 
kicks in, and Amine strikes. On 
Friday, the same routine was 
on full display. After making it 
through one scoreless period, 
Amine blew things open in the 
second, starting with a low leg 
attack to get his first takedown.
“I pride myself on being 
really offensive, so always on 
the attack, and somewhat of a 
grinder,” Amine said. “I think 
usually I saw myself in a lot 
of tight matches early in the 
first period or even early in 
the second period, but really 
finding a way separating myself 
going into the second or third 

period. Guys start to get tired, 
I think. That’s when I can 
really start to take advantage of 
blowing open a match.”
Now with a quality win under 
his belt to start the season, 
Amine knows how high the 
bar has been set. In response, 
his goal remains the same 
— a national championship. 
Finishing third in last year’s 
tournament, 
Amine 
knows 
there’s still some work to be 
done to attain the top spot 
in the nation and conquer 
college 
wrestling’s 
field 
of 
174-pounders.
“My goal is to win a national 
championship, and change the 
third ranking to that number 
one ranking and prove a lot of 
people wrong,” Amine said. 
“There are two guys above 
me that there’s a lot of hype 
around, and I lost two really 
close matches to both of those 
guys, so there’s a fuel to the 
fire to be added, and I’ve really 
been training a lot to get to the 
top of that podium.”
Beyond the added pressure to 
sit atop the podium, Amine now 
must face his new role as a bona 
fide leader of the wrestling 
squad. 
After 
the 
departure 
of 
former 
team 
captains 
Domenic 
Abounader 
and 
Adam 
Coon, 
Amine 
is one of the 
upperclassmen 
that 
his 
teammates 
will look to for 
guidance and poise.
And 
if 
his 
performance 
on Friday is any indication, 
Amine’s method of leading by 
example will go just fine this 
season.
“I think if anything, it’s only 
made the sport of wrestling 
for me that much better,” 
Amine said. “As much as it is 
a team sport, you’re out there 
by 
yourself, 
so 
it’s 
pretty 
individual. So when you try 
to assume a leadership role 
like becoming a captain, you 
need to focus on helping out 
other guys, and I like to think 
I’ve done that as much as I 
can. Being able to see people’s 
progress through your help is 
probably just as rewarding as 
seeing your own progress.”
This is coming from a guy 
who has seen plenty of his own 
progress through his college 
career. Now he is ready to see 
the fruits of his labor and has 
officially put college wrestling 
on notice.

Livers adapting to new role as sixth man

Last 
year, 
Isaiah 
Livers 
took the tip-off as the starting 
power forward in the national 
championship game.
The next game the sophomore 
forward played in — Tuesday’s 
opener against Norfolk State — 
he came off the bench.
It’s not often that a player 
who secured a starting job as 
a freshman, especially one on 
a team that went as far as the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
did, loses it before the start of 
the next season. But Livers is 
embracing the change.
“It’s 
new 
for 
me 
from 
starting last year,” Livers said. 
“But I agree with everything 
(Michigan coach John Beilein) 
says and it kind of makes sense, 
having some leadership come off 
the bench. I’m cool.”
Livers’ 
leadership 
is 
especially 
vital 
given 
the 
player that has replaced him 
as the starting power forward 
— freshman Ignas Brazdeikis. 
With Livers sidelined for a 
chunk of the offseason with an 
ankle injury, Brazdeikis stepped 
into the rotation and found a 
rhythm with the rest of the 
team. Once the season started, 
Beilein rolled with him.
But even for a player as 
talented as Brazdeikis, jumping 
to the college level will have a 
learning curve. While he was 
injured, Livers devoted time to 
helping coach Brazdeikis, and 
he’s carried that role over into 
the regular season.
“Isaiah is a team guy,” Beilein 
said. “And he’ll fill that role 
well.”
Being the sixth man will also 
require a physical adjustment. 
Instead of the routine that 
comes with being the starting 
4-man, Livers must prepare to 
play any position besides point 
guard and enter in any situation. 
Especially on defense, Livers 
will have to adapt on the fly to 
wherever he’s needed.

But Livers has been in this 
position before. At the beginning 
of last year, the starting ‘4’ 
was 
now-graduated 
Duncan 
Robinson, 
who 
transitioned 
to a swingman role as Livers 
assumed 
the 
starting job.
“It’s 
different,” 
Livers 
said. 
Then he paused.
“It’s 
not 
actually, 
it’s 
not 
different 
at all, because 
last year I came 
off the bench at 
the 
beginning 
for Duncan and then I started. 
But I still kinda felt like a sixth 
man last year because Duncan, 
he was a veteran, he was a very 
smart player. … It was basically 
kind of the same as I’m doing 
right now.”
Robinson was a different 

player than Livers — his game 
was 3-point shooting, whereas 
Livers is a better defender and 
has a bigger post presence. 
But 
despite 
not 
starting, 
Robinson still frequently made 
a difference on 
the court, and 
Livers’ starting 
experience 
indicates 
he’s 
capable 
of 
a 
similar impact.
Tuesday 
against Norfolk 
State, 
Livers 
was the second 
player off the 
bench. He still 
finished with eight points — 
including two made 3-pointers 
— and three assists and co-led 
the team with eight rebounds. 
If he continues to put up similar 
stats, he’ll find plenty of minutes 
and remain an integral part of 
the team.

“I just told him that his 
shooting has been so good in 
practice,” Beilein said. “And I 
said, we’re not gonna treat you 
any different than we would 
Duncan Robinson. … What he 
also does for us is he’s the talker 
out 
there 
defensively. 
He’s 
talking to everybody.”
During his freshman season, 
Livers showed flashes of the 
versatility and leadership that 
will make him so valuable off 
the bench, but in the offseason, 
he’s developed those skills even 
more. And though he still wants 
to start — what player doesn’t? 
— Livers is ready for anything, 
even if he’s not on the court at 
first tip.
“I’m gonna get my job done, 
I’m gonna do my best to help the 
team,” Livers said. “ … Obviously 
if I was asked to start I would 
take the job and go start, but 
(Beilein) knows what he’s doing 
and I’m gonna trust his process.”

Adjustments lead to uptick in intensity

In 
the 
two-day 
series 
against Lake Superior State 
last weekend, the Michigan 
hockey team played like two 
vastly different teams.
Caught off guard by the 
Lakers’ physicality on Friday, 
the Wolverines were reeling 
after losing their early 1-0 lead 
in what looked more like a 
heavyweight bout rather than 
a typical collegiate hockey 
game. Regardless, the team 
lacked intensity on both ends 
of the ice.
“We went into the game 
Friday and I guess you could 
say we weren’t really ready for 
the level of physicality,” said 
sophomore forward Michael 
Pastujov. “We hadn’t really 
seen that yet this year.”
Adjustments 
ensued. 
On 
Saturday, 
Michigan 
looked 
more 
prepared 
for 
Lake 
Superior State’s physical style 
of play –– embracing it even. 
Players looked to finish their 
checks while still staying true 
to the team’s strengths. From 
the opening faceoff, it was 
evident that the Wolverines’ 
approach 
was 
different. 
However, 
Michigan 
hockey 
coach Mel Pearson and his 
skaters know that the fervor 
exhibited on Saturday should 
be the norm, not the reaction.
To replicate and sustain a 
high level of energy, Pearson 
is striving to 
create 
healthy 
competition 
among 
his 
roster.
Last 
weekend, 
freshman 
forward Nolan 
Moyle 
saw 
significant 
ice 
time 
in 
what 
were 
his 
second 
and 
third 
regular season appearances. 
Freshman defenseman Jake 
Gingell and junior forward 
Adam Windborg dressed for 
their first and second times, 
respectively, on Saturday in 
lieu of freshmen forwards Jack 

Randl and Jimmy Lambert. 
And 
freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss Mann received the 
start in the net over junior 
Hayden Lavigne.
With 
the 
exception 
of 
Michigan 
taking 
eight 
penalties, Saturday showcased 
the 
level 
of 
effort 
that 
Pearson 
expects 
from 
his 
skaters. 
To some, the 
penalties 
may 
even be viewed 
as an indicator 
of the uptick in 
intensity.
Pearson has 
expressed that 
he 
wants 
interchangeable 
pieces in the lineup. That 
means ice time is up for grabs, 
especially with the addition 
of a 19th skater under the new 
NCAA rule implemented this 
season.
“We weren’t happy with 

some of the efforts on Friday 
and more importantly it was 
to reward those guys because 
they — and Nolan Moyle — 
had looked good in practice,” 
Pearson said. “You have to 
reward guys, you have to 
continue to reward guys if 
they’ve earned 
an opportunity 
to play.
“Those guys 
are proud, they 
want 
to 
play 
and so they’ll 
come in the way 
they did today 
(in 
practice) 

and work hard 
to try and get 
back 
in 
the 
lineup. We want to be able 
to … create that competition 
and try to give them some 
incentive to continue to work 
hard and continue to compete 
to get in a game or get in 
games.”
Few 
players 
on 
the 

roster this season know the 
difficulty 
of 
cracking 
the 
rotation like Gingell does. The 
freshman is a part of the group 
of players that has recently 
garnered attention in practice 
–– leading to his insertion in 
the lineup for the second game 
of the series. 
Knowing 
that 
they are vying 
for 
playing 
time, 
the 
pressure is on 
to compete in 
practice 
and 
make an impact 
every time they 
step onto the 
ice.
“It’s just a 
whole different game, you 
know,” Gingell said. “When 
you sit in the stands, you don’t 
feel as into it but when you’re 
on the bench, everything just 
comes together, and you know 
the hockey that you’ve been 
playing your entire life.”

Stories of life: Slices in the cake of human experience

Consider something as short 
as a single tweet: 280 characters 
to express your most surreal, 
plain, intrusive or wholesome 
thoughts. Now take the 137,374 
defined Unicode characters 
and 
permutate 
them 
with 
Twitter’s strict character limit 
and you get … well, a seemingly 
infinite number of possible 
tweets. That number would 
approach 
the 
point 
where 
conventional 
mathematical 
language becomes pointless 
and “bazillion” is the best 
delineation. But the thing is, 
it is a number. It has some end.
Now, of course someone 
isn’t going to tweet out all 
the combinations that could 
be made with the spiderweb 
emoji, an inverted question 
mark and the letter Æ, so the 
number of possible tweets can 
be cut by, let’s say, half. Still, 

that leaves a lot of room to 
stretch one’s creative legs. But, 
has all that creative potential 
been exploited? Is Twitter 
approaching a critical mass at 
which every good tweet will 
start to be recycled? Are none 
of us original?
This 
thought 
didn’t 
cripple my comedy until I 
stumbled into an inane joke 
while texting a friend: If 
David Attenborough made a 
documentary about Grindr, it 
would be called Planet Girth. 
Yet searching “planet girth” 
on Twitter before I was about 
to post my own thoughts 
yielded 
dozens 
of 
similar 
search results, all of which 
arrived at the same conclusion 
assumingly 
independent 
of 
each other.
Maybe the question is not 
if 
Twitter 
had 
exhausted 
all possible combinations of 
usable characters and words 
and if every imaginable tweet 
will soon 
be sent, but 

we should instead consider 
if we have exhausted every 
idiosyncratic 
thought. 
In 
a song that served as the 
inspiration 
for 
the 
above 
title, Brandon Flowers of The 
Killers sings “Has every ship 
gone sailing? Has every heart 
gone blue?”
All of these questions racing 
through my mind made me 
wonder if the common bonds 
connecting our individual lives 
and experiences are stronger 
and more similar than we 
think. So, I set out to compile 
this collection of micro-stories 
from the happenings of my 
own life and the accounts of 
others, blurring actuality and 
speculation. Unless specifically 
identified for an interview, 
no person mentioned (and 
their 
respective 
pronouns) 
necessarily has a real life 
analogue. Call it true flash 
fiction, if you will.
With all that in order, let 
us embark on this shared 
journey 
through 
memories, 
through Ann Arbor cultural 
institutions, through artistic 
escapades, through life.

B-SIDE LEAD

Has it all been written?

CARTER FOX / DAILY

The smell of freshly made 
waffle cones was a heavenly 
distraction 
waiting 
on 
the 
long, low bench. While divine, 
Blank Slate Creamery doesn’t 
particularly 
remind 
me 
of 
the simple shops I patronized 
throughout 
my 
childhood 
and the gallons of ice cream 
consumed from them. It’s a 
bit too neat, too bohemian 
to 
conjure 
images 
of 
the 
hometown 
lunch 
counters 
where I got my fix, those 
that doubled as ice cream 
parlors 
after 
school 
ended 
and entertained with simple 
treats and pinball machines. 

Yet to some seven-year-old in 
2018, this is their childhood, 
what they’ll yearn for when 
liquid nitrogen balls and rolled 
ice cream become the new 
standard.
Lana Hinojosa, an employee 
at Blank Slate and recent 
University graduate, seemed 
to share a similar nostalgia, 
reminiscing 
of 
“being 
carefree,” “ignorance is bliss,” 
“no problems” when I asked her 
what she missed about being 
a kid. Oh, and “lots of PBJs.” 
Like most of us, her palate 
has refined over the years, 
now preferring the seasonal 
gingerbread flavor exclusive to 
Blank Slate over the “artificial 
ones like Superman and Bubble 
Gum.” While Hinojosa has 

never been fond of anything 
strawberry-flavored, we both 
shared that same youthful love 
of those visually appealing 
and disgusting flavors, unholy 
mixes of red, yellow and blue 
we ordered purely because it 
looked cool.
Wrapping up our very brief 
chat, I asked her to share her 
saddest story involving ice 
cream. “When I was little, 
I stepped on the (block ‘M’ 
in the middle of the Diag) 
and dropped my ice cream 
immediately after,” Hinojosa 
remembered. “It actually is bad 
luck!” On the way out, I didn’t 
see any toddler spoil the floor 
with their heaping cones and 
wondered if it was due to their 
good luck or mine.

Bad luck

A24

The first thing they really did 
together was see “Lady Bird,” a 
gamble on her part because she 
knew not of his tastes, only of his 
girlfriend. Still, he accepted; they 
entered as friends, they laughed 
as friends, they cried as friends, 
they got ice cream afterward 
as friends. He says it’s the most 
he’s ever related to a female 
protagonist in his moviegoing 
life, while she responds saying 
the movie might as well be her 
life.
“I didn’t know you lived in 
California,” he interjects.
“I’ve moved around, from 
East to West and everywhere in 
between, so to make it easy I just 
say I’m from Grand Rapids,” she 
states plainly, reciting a speech 
she has said a thousand times 
before.
“That’s 
really 
awesome,” 
he responds, a hint of genuine 
interest emerges. “I’ve moved 
around a lot because of my dad’s 
job. What about you?”

“Oh, you know, kind of the 
same, really. That, and family.”

She was hiding something, 

something she had left behind in 
that wretched state, something 
he would come to learn because 
he stuck around.
The two also slowly learned 
the other didn’t really want to 
be alive, and while they weren’t 
exactly the best for each other, 
they did help, and both lived to 
tell the tale of the other to exes of 
future past.
Years later, she finds herself in 
the big city, attending a special 
screening of the classic “Lady 
Bird” in a small theater. The 
audience made up of mostly 
first-time viewers, they laugh at 
all the wrong moments and she 
feels the greater need to conceal 
her crying. She can’t believe 
they laugh when it’s Lady Bird’s 
birthday and her dad presents 
her with a meager cupcake. She 
thinks of her dad and the special 
cupcakes he made for her on 
her special day, both of which 
have become one with the hard 
California ground.

No one wants to die in California

The inside-out pajamas did 
the trick. The neighborhood-
wide flushing of ice cubes 
down 
the 
toilet 
was 
so 
ridiculous it actually worked: 
These Southern rugrats finally 
saw snow for the first time in 
their short lives. Seeing their 
district listed on the wobbly 
image of CRT television was a 
sight they wouldn’t see again 
for some time after, so they 
cherished it as best they could. 
When the snowmen finally 
melted, 
they 
all 
returned 

home for mom’s special cup 
of Swiss Miss and retreated 
to their rooms to spend more 
time with the Littlest Pet Shop 
toys or the copy of “Super 
Mario Galaxy” they got for 
Christmas a few odd weeks 
ago.
The 
kids 
in 
the 
North 
trudged 
onto 
the 
bus, 
stomping the snow off their 
boots before they got to their 
seats and turning the walkway 
into a slippery, slushy slice of 
rubber. It had snowed for the 

past two weeks, and here they 
were braving the arctic tundra 
to get to school. Half-assing 
their homework, they were not 
placated when they saw news 
reports from the kitchen table 
of entire states shutting down 
thanks to a half-inch of snow. 
They went to bed peeved, and 
while they slept, the buses 
could not start. Their mothers 
could let them sleep in the 
next morning.
Nowadays, the internet is 
the school’s last line of defense 
and homework still comes, and 
that one winter snow day they 
used to look forward to the 
whole year isn’t fun anymore.

One day a year

“I think the world was cooler 
without 
cellphones,” 
Curtis 
Sullivan, 
co-owner 
and 
self-
proclaimed “counter watcher” at 
Main Street’s Vault of Midnight, 
said, laughing as he added, “That’s 
an old man thing to say.” The Vault 
is a carefully curated love letter to 
the times when “you didn’t have 
your face buried in (that) stupid 
thing,” Sullivan explained. When 
“you would, like, ride bikes and 
shit.”
The walls and shelves of the 
Vault are lined with books and 
baubles we would excitedly stuff 
into our backpacks before biking 
down to our best friend’s house to 
show it off. There’s comics about 
Conan the Barbarian, the Teen 
Titans and Sonic the Hedgehog, the 
favorite heroes of a young Sullivan, 
surrounded by “The Art of Wes 
Anderson” hardbacks, Gudetama 
the Lazy Egg figures and puzzles 

showing scenes from “Super Mario 
Odyssey.”

It’s all the stuff for which we 
would beg our parents and hold 

out until our birthdays, a trip 
down memory lane for dorks of all 
kinds, even self-proclaimed super-
dorks like Sullivan who “did model 
rockets, flew kites (and) had model 
railroads.”
With some intense trumpet 
instrumental 
playing 
in 
the 
background, 
Sullivan 
casually 
drops the fact that he worships 
Satan only 10 seconds into our 
conversation, and I’m relieved 
he’s just as weird as me, two nerds 
separated by scant decades.
“Just kidding,” he clarified. 
“That’s what people used to say 
back in 1982 if you played Dungeons 
and Dragons.”
I think of how nervous I was 
when my grade school friend’s 
Catholic mom took his Pokémon 
cards away from him, fearing my 
mom would do the same, sliding 
my Tyranitar collector’s tin under 
my bed as soon as I got home.

Heresy, in glorious Technicolor

FILE PHOTO / DAILY

Up until that point, he 
was stranded exactly twice 
in his life. Both were caused 
by a failure to understand 
but solved by the ability to 
communicate. 
Had 
he 
not 
had the cellphone his dad 
somehow got for 25 bucks 
at the local hardware store, 
he probably would’ve had to 
resort to busking, drifting 
throughout life relying on 
his only bankable skill — 

his forced knowledge of the 
saxophone.
Luckily, each time he was 
able to call one of his parents 
and dictate where he thought 
he was in that foreign country. 
It took always took a bit, but he 
was located nonetheless, both 
times the parent accompanied 
by a family friend. Strange, 
looking back on it.
Now he wishes his parents, 
or even their friends, were on 
speed dial, but it would take 
them hours to drive to this 
faraway state. The irony: He 
has the world at his fingertips, 

but to try and touch it would cut 
those selfsame fingertips since 
he broke it in the commotion 
of his first college party. In the 
short time it took to find the 
smartphone in the bedlam of 
spastic, disparate feet, those 
few others seen arriving with 
him were nowhere to be seen. 
Hopefully he could tipsily 
remember the confusing way 
back to his dorm. Hopefully 
he’d make it back, stretcher 
or not. Hopefully his parents 
would never ask what the 
police reported he was in 
possession of.

Mixing it all together: The 
magic of musical mashups

I didn’t know what song 
was playing when I stepped 
into Underground Sounds but 
I know, for a fact, that “Uncle 
Albert/Admiral 
Halsey” 
by 
Paul and Linda McCartney 
was playing when I was talking 
with owner Matthew Bradish 
about guilty pleasures, a term 
we mutually concluded doesn’t 
really mean anything.
“For some people, The Doors 
and The Monkees are guilty 
pleasures, but I don’t feel that 
guilty about it anymore,” he 
said with a smile.
Earlier, 
I 
had 
watched 
Bradish select the McCartney 

song and have it instantly play 
over the speaker system. It was 
“the song (he) remember(s) the 
earliest.” He told me “it makes 
(him) think of (his) mother and 
her ’71 Green Chevelle.”
Bradish certainly had the 
musical leg up on me, as I 
failed to identify Viva Hate as 
Morrissey’s first solo album 
after mentioning I had been 
listening to a lot of The Smiths 
recently (which is never a good 
sign). When I asked Bradish 
about a special memory he had 
with physical music as a kid, he 
mentioned “a cassette tape that 
(he) made from records: One 
side was Beastie Boys’ Licensed 
to Ill and the other side was 
Smash Hits by Jimi Hendrix.” 
His passion for the music that 
literally surrounds him every 

day working at Underground 
Sounds is evident; he noted his 
“music taste has gotten a fair 
bit broader,” but “still not that 
much into what a lot of people 
would call noise.”
Before I had approached 
him for an interview, Bradish 
asked two leaving customers if 
they had voted, trying to entice 
them with a small discount to 
buy some of the records they 
had been flipping through for 
minutes. In a strong Manchester 
accent, one of them explained 
they weren’t exactly from here, 
and a chuckle was had by both 
parties. I pass hundreds of 
people a day walking through 
the Ann Arbor streets but 
would never think to stop and 
ask someone where they are 
going, and where they’ve been.

Fake fans 

We’re often told to dance 
like nobody’s watching, but the 
problem is we dance better in our 
heads. However, they can’t help 
but move as the parking garage 
elevator descends. They feel 
about to combust after coming 
out to their whole nuclear 
family, which, unsurprisingly, 
was marked by confusion and 
an untimely exit on their part, 
fueled by the primal human 

desire to flee when we no longer 
feel safe. And there they are, 
eyes closed, shoes shuffling, 
waiting for the robotic voice to 
declare “GROUND FLOOR.” 
They make their way to the 
exit and in the direction of 
the scheduled refuge of their 
friend’s apartment. They hate 
that they can no longer rely on 
their family, but they remain 
thankful for the new family 
they’ve found.
The sidewalks were mostly 
empty, so, with Ariel Pink’s 
“Kitchen Witch” playing in 

their 
earphones, 
they 
took 
a spirit form, transcending 
to an ethereal plain as they 
whirled robotic and pirouetted 
naturally. It’s just them and 
their music. The concrete is 
their stage and passersby make 
up the audience (but they aren’t 
really watching), so their legs 
freestyle with the intention 
of coming off as smooth as 
Childish Gambino. Don’t tell 
them they’re as stilted as a poor 
YouTube 
imitation 
because 
they don’t care. It’s their story, 
and you’re just an extra.

Dancing

FILE PHOTO / DAILY

I was supposed to interview 
someone at the State Theatre 
for this piece, but despite 
sitting in its lobby on two 
separate occasions I couldn’t 
bring myself to ask one of the 
workers for an interview. The 
fear I had developed while 
operating under this brand of 
Gonzo journalism was one of 
rejection, a fear that I would 
either not secure an interview 
in the first place or that I would 
get answers I couldn’t work 
with. I mean, yeah, everyone 
remembers 
their 
first 
job, 
but would they really give me 
something insightful if I asked 
what they spent their first 
paycheck on? The first R-rated 
movie they saw? The movie 
that always makes them cry?
I 
found 
myself 
unable 
to escape this notion I had 
developed in the introductory 
story, that none of us are 
really original, that whatever 
answers I would hear have 
been already said. Hell, are 
my own answers to those 
questions even that special? 
This all led to a textbook mini 
panic attack, the kind where 
social anxiety kicks in and 
makes you aware of everyone 
staring at you, freaking out 
over the terrible things they 
could be thinking.
With the help of some food 
in my body and a brisk walk 
back to my building, I was able 

to calm down, partly because 
no one even realized any of this 
interior struggle. No one in the 
atrium of the State noticed my 
loitering presence, so what’s to 
say the people I were eyeing to 
interview aren’t going through 
something 
similar? 
We 
all 
have our own troubles, big or 
small, that we ultimately have 
to solve on our own. And a lot 
of the times, we keep it in, to 
fit in, to be normal. To not be 
realized when we’re minding 
our daily business, to be just 
another face in the crowd. 
Here I was freaking out over 
other 
people’s 
perceptions 
of me while also having an 
existential crisis because I feel 
we’re all blending together 
into some sort of unintelligible 
mess. Everybody wants to rule 
the world, but nobody wants to 
know who makes it up.
A couple weeks ago, after a 
movie night with my friends, 
one of them polled the room 
if they should make a push for 
Rick’s American Cafe. When 
it came my turn to cast my 
vote, I said “you’re only 21 on 
Oct. 19 one time in your life.” 
She took this as a fair point, 
and I went to the bathroom 
shortly after and reworked 
what I said into the title of 
this 
specific 
story, 
seeing 
some 
potential 
poignance. 
“You’re only everything once.” 
What does this even mean? 

I haven’t the slightest clue, 
but I feel through gathering 
information, 
interviewing 
others and observing randoms 
for this piece, I might be a little 
closer to answering that.
At this moment in time, you 
are the sum of so many distinct 
experiences, not only with 
yourself, but with others, with 
people you’ve never met, with 
culture, with the internet. Yet 
evaluate yourself a day later 
and you may find yourself 
the sum of even more, just by 
the nature of you continuing 
to live. We are continuously 
everything we’ve been through 
and everything that surrounds 
us, 
but 
this 
everything 
approaches infinity as time 
goes on. There’s no limit on 
this everything, unlike the 
case of the Twitter, and under 
this definition, the thought 
that we are all permutations 
of the same thing falters. We 
all make up a complex mosaic, 
constantly 
moving, 
living, 
breathing; I have a renewed 
optimism thinking about this 
after going out in search of 
the heart of Ann Arbor and 
intertwining myself with the 
stories of others.
So 
go 
ahead, 
post 
that 
unoriginal tweet, go to Rick’s, 
put yourself out there. If we 
remain stagnant, we will never 
have stories to tell. Without 
stories, how can life go on?

You’re only everything once

The 
saddest 
moment 
of 
her life finds her surrounded 
by rose petals and tea lights, 
arranged 
by 
someone 
she 
wishes she could love. Sitting 
cross-legged on the floor, she 
has nothing to say, and when 
they finally make more than a 
second of tenuous eye contact, 
the gaze she receives tells her 
“you should just go.” It’s a 
cold walk back, and she feels a 
waste, someone who couldn’t 
even put aside the shoddy state 

of the relationship and tell 
someone she appreciates them 
for once. I mean, you loved her, 
didn’t you? Well, you certainly 
said it to her more than once.
In 
recounting 
the 
story 
to 
her 
roommate 
she 
is 
reassured that her soon-to-be 
ex-girlfriend wasn’t the best 
person in the world either, 
but while she is shamefully 
offering the details, it comes 
together like a movie scene. If 
viewed through the door, one 
would see her, seated, back 
facing the camera, struggling 
to keep herself together while 
also keeping quiet, as her once-

lover blows out the candles 
and picks up the floral scatter.
She begins to think of 
almost everything she does 
through the lens of the movie 
camera, from the close-ups of 
the facial features she makes 
in future fights to her walks 
under the apricot sky. We 
never get to know if she makes 
it to Hollywood and makes it 
big, but we should take this 
moment to stop and consider 
whether 
or 
not 
our 
lives 
would make for distinctive 
adaptations 
on 
the 
silver 
screen, and if we’d be the most 
reliable person to tell it.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

I was first introduced to 
mashups at the ripe age of 14, 
when I was first getting into 
music. My sister gave me her 
iPod and had me listen to a 
song she downloaded from the 
internet called “Future Dads 
(Platinum Edition).” It was from 
the debut mixtape of L.A.-based 
trio Super Mash Bros: Fuck 
Bitches. Get Euros.
When I pressed play, the 
effortless flow of Jay-Z’s “Dirt 
Off Your Shoulder” rang over 
CkY’s 
aggressive 
nu-metal 
jam “96 Quite Bitter Beings” 
— 
a 
jarring, 
yet 
thrilling 
combination. A mere 40 seconds 
later, CkY’s track transitioned 
into the familiar piano riff from 
Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand 
Miles,” with Jay-Z’s raps still 
banging over the beat. After an 
interjection of Lil Wayne and 
Birdman’s “Pop Bottles,” the 
song shifted into a playful mix 
of 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” and a 
hyperactive, hip-hop alteration 
of The Jackson 5’s “I Want You 
Back.”
From its mesmerizing blend of 
genres to its brilliantly random 
title, “Future Dads (Platinum 
Edition)” would become the 
portal into my intense obsession 
with Super Mash Bros and 
mashups as a whole. The social 
hellscape of eighth grade had 
already instilled within me a 
hunger to be cool, a need to 
distinguish my music taste from 
that of my peers. Listening to 
mashups and creating my own 
mashups seemed like the perfect 
outlet.
Making a mashup seems easy 
in theory — you take two songs, 
overlap the vocals from one 
on top of the instrumental of 
another, and voila. But don’t let 
that oversimplified explanation 
fool you into thinking that a 
mashup is just some gimmick. 
Rearranging 
and 
splicing 
together 
pre-recorded 
songs 
requires a varied, comprehensive 
understanding of pop music and 
an adept ear for recognizing 
songs with the same tempo and 
key. It’s a painstaking process 
that involves constant tinkering: 
A song is deconstructed to its 
bare bones, then reconstructed 
and 
reincarnated 
into 
a 
compelling 
and 
infectious 
collage.
While some may consider 
mashups 
a 
new 
innovation, 
there’s a rich history behind 
them that dates back more than 
60 years. The earliest appearance 
of a mashup came in 1956 when 
musicians Bill Buchanan and 
Dickie 
Goodman 
assembled 
snippets of the narration from 
Orson Welles’s infamous “War of 
the Worlds” radio broadcast into 
their song “The Flying Saucer.” 
Though the term “mashup” had 
not entered the cultural lexicon 
then, Buchanan and Goodman 
named their creation a “break-
in” song in reference to the 
way Welles’s voice broke the 
standard melody.
Later on in the ’60s and ’70s, 
counterculture 
icon 
Frank 
Zappa created his own method 
of mashup music known as 
xenochrony, a technique that 
extracts a guitar solo or other 
musical element from its original 
context and places it into a 
completely different song. An 
example of xenochrony can be 
heard in the ending of Zappa’s 
1968 song “Lonely Little Girl,” 
which uses the drums, bass, 
vibraphone and orchestra from 
his 1966 track “How Could I Be 
Such A Fool.” The result is subtle, 
but this style of experimentation 
serves as a precursor to mashups.
As mashups took on a more 
explicit form in the ’80s, their 
creative 
and 
commercial 
potential skyrocketed as high 
as 
their 
cultural 
relevance 
expanded. In the summer of 
1982, Italian DJ Stefano Pulga, 
guitarist 
Luciano 
Ninzatti, 
keyboardist-programmer 
Matteo Bonsanto and sound 
engineer Massimo Noè formed 
an anonymous band known as 
Pink Project and released “Disco 
Project,” a mashup that combined 
elements 
of 
Pink 
Floyd’s 

“Another Brick in the Wall 
(Part 2)” with the instrumental 
of The Alan Parsons Project’s 
“Mammagamma.” Though the 
song was a one-hit wonder for 
Pink Project — they released a 
handful of other mashups with 
little success — “Disco Project” 
helped lay the foundation for 
what a modern-day mashup 
could sound like: two seemingly 
un-pairable 
songs 
paired 
together. 
With the advancement of 
technology and music software 
in the late ’90s and early 2000s, 
mashups became more defined — 
known then as “bootleg remixes” 
— and subsequently ignited a 
subcultural 
movement. 
The 
most notable instance of their 
impact arrived in 2001 when UK 
artist Roy Kerr, known by his 

stage name Freelance Hellraiser, 
coupled 
Christina 
Aguilera’s 
“Genie in a Bottle” with The 
Strokes’s “Hard to Explain” into 
a catchy concoction, cleverly 
titled “A Stroke of Genie-us.” 
Both songs are pretty disparate 
from one another, but somehow, 
Kerr alchemized the two in 
such a way that they not only 
work together, but enhance 
one another. Oddly enough, 
Aguilera’s powerful range plays 
well against Albert Hammond 
Jr.’s raucous, distorted guitars, 
reframing the R&B-pop soul 
of “Genie in a Bottle” as a 
spectacular 
and 
devastating 
power ballad — it even sounds 
like it could’ve been a long-lost 
Kelly Clarkson demo from her 
2004 record Breakaway.
Though Kerr’s instantaneous 
fame 
was 
short-lived, 
the 
effect of “A Stroke of a Genie-
us” legitimized mashups as an 
influential subgenre during the 
2000s, allowing music nerds 
a chance to flex their creative 
muscles and push the limits of 
copyright laws by distributing 
their creations online for free. 
Before he became a mega music 
producer and one half of indie 
hip-hop duo Gnarls Barkley, 
Brian 
Burton 
(aka 
Danger 
Mouse) came into prominence 
in 2004 with The Grey Album, 
a 
landmark 
mashup 
record 
that mixed vocals from Jay-
Z’s 
The 
Black 
Album 
with 
instrumental pieces from The 
Beatles’s 1968 LP White Album. 
Australian electronic collective 
The 
Avalanches 
capitalized 
on 
this 
freedom 
as 
well, 
merging their own ambient live 
instrumentation with an arsenal 
of hip hop and psychedelic rock 
samples (35,000 to be exact) 
on their 2000 debut Since I 
Left You. As these albums set 
the momentum of modern-day 
mashups, self-made producers 
like Girl Talk, Super Mash 
Bros, The Hood Internet and 
DJ Earworm sprouted onto the 
Internet, each offering their own 

distinctive take on mashups.
Girl Talk, the stage name 
for Pittsburgh-based DJ Gregg 
Gillis, began his career with 
an abstract, frenetic glitch-pop 
sound, manifesting in 2002’s 
noisy Secret Diary and 2004’s 
more accessible Unstoppable. 
Retaining the crackhead energy 
of his earlier efforts, Gillis refined 
and streamlined his approach on 
2006’s critically acclaimed Night 
Ripper, an astounding display of 
sonic dexterity that coalesced 
’90s pop, raunchy hip hop and 
alternative rock. Girl Talk only 
improved from there with 2008’s 
Feed the Animals and 2010’s All 
Day, each album playing out 
like one endless, entertaining 
game of hopscotch. With his 
nimble touch and rousing live 
performances, 
Gillis 
built 
mashups like miniature, non-
stop parties featuring artists 
from every generation and genre, 
from Kanye West and Elton John 
to Soulja Boy and Aphex Twin, 
T-Pain and Avril Lavigne to 
Ludacris and Phoenix.
Like Girl Talk, Super Mash 
Bros 
embraced 
the 
fleeting 
quality of mashups through 
their own work. With Fuck 
Bitches. Get Euros. and its 
equally electric follow-ups All 
About The Scrillions and Mile(y) 
High Club, Super Mash Bros 
transformed an array of early-
2000s pop songs into hard-
hitting bangers, chopping them 
up and perfecting them into 
danceable, club-ready jams made 
for high school homecomings 
and college mixers. Even more 
prolific are Chicago-based The 
Hood Internet, who have been 
churning 
out 
mixtape 
after 
mixtape of mashups since 2007, 
and San Francisco-based DJ 
Earworm, who compiles the 
top 25 songs of every year into 
a mashup known as “United 
State of Pop,” his most notable 
achievement 
being 
2009’s 
“Blame It on the Pop.”
The mashup scene thrived 
during this era, though its 
success would eventually wear 
off at the turn of the decade. 
The once-popular Fox musical 
comedy “Glee” helped bring 
mainstream appeal to mashups 
in 
its 
season-one 
episode 
“Vitamin D,” which includes 
arguably the best songs from 
the “Glee” catalog: Finn (Cory 
Monteith, “Monte Carlo”) leads 
the guys in a rollicking, energetic 
fusion of Bon Jovi’s “It’s My 
Life” and Usher’s “Confessions 
(Part II),” while Rachel (Lea 
Michele, “New Year’s Eve”) and 
the girls combine Beyoncé’s 
“Halo” and Katrina and the 
Waves’s “Walking on Sunshine” 
in a rendition that could only 
be described as transcendent. 
But in 2012, “Pitch Perfect” and 
acapella quintet Pentatonix rode 
the slowly evaporating wave 
of the mashup’s popularity to 
its bitter lull, destabilizing the 
mashup’s 
underground, 
anti-
capitalist allure through a series 
of fun yet fluffy and amateurish 
commercialized morsels.
While the majority of mashup 
artists have moved on or receded 
into virtual obscurity, there are 
glimmers of hope that mashups 
could find their way back again 
into the cultural limelight. The 
Magic iPod, a mashup generator 
website, 
gives 
audiophiles 
the ability to mix a mashup of 
their own choosing based on 
a selection of the best pop and 
hip-hop songs from the 2000s. 
Twitter user Noah Charlick 
gained 
brief 
notoriety 
for 
sharing his strangely cohesive 
mashup of Kendrick Lamar’s 
“Backseat Freestyle” and A-Ha’s 
“Take on Me,” and Twitter 
user oypoolboy provided an 
even stranger mashup of Travis 
Scott’s “Sicko Mode” and Ricky 
Martin’s “Livin’ La Vida Loca.” 
Whatever the future may hold 
for mashups, they remain a 
testament to the DIY spirit of 
music-making. The ability to 
manipulate and edit pre-existing 
songs into a mosaic of sound 
not only empowers consumers 
to become their own producers, 
but offers a refreshing twist to 
how we celebrate and appreciate 
music: You can listen to two or 
more great songs at once without 
paying a dime.

The musical interlude

An interlude, at its most basic 
definition, is “an intervening or 
interruptive period, space, or 
event.” Technically speaking, 
an 
interlude 
is 
meant 
to 
disrupt, to draw attention or 
to provide something else to 
focus on. Albums are often 
judged on their cohesion and 
flow, on how well each song 
complements the entire album 
in the context of its specific 
tracklisting. So where exactly 
does the decision to include 
an interlude come into play? 

Famous 
interludes 
include 
Björk’s 
“Frosti,” 
Beyoncé’s 
“Yoncé” that introduces hit 
“Partition” and SZA’s “Wavy” 
from the critically-acclaimed 
CTRL. Interludes are far from 
genre restricted, and often pose 
interesting questions about the 
way a listener will interact with 
the piece of music.
Frank Ocean’s Blonde was 
the greatest release of 2016, 
featuring 
the 
maternally-
charged 
interlude 
“Be 
Yourself,” 
connecting 
the 
immortal ambience of “Pink 
+ White” to the give-and-take 
defiance of “Solo.” The gentle 
resignation of “Pink + White” 

is quickly interrupted with: 
“Many college students have 
gone to college and gotten 
hooked on drugs, marijuana 
and alcohol. Listen. Stop trying 
to be somebody else.” It’s a 1:27 
voicemail from a seemingly 
overbearing 
mother, 
which 
suddenly drops from: “This 
is mom. Call me. Bye” into: 
“Hand me a towel I’m dirty 
dancing by myself / Gone off 
tabs of that acid / Form me 
a circle, watch my jagger / 
Might lose my jacket and hit 
a solo.” After being told to “be 
yourself” through abstinence, 
Ocean naturally responds by 
hitting solos with the help of

‘Over the Garden Wall’ & 
feel-good Fall heartache

Fall is my favorite season. I 
could write a whole other article 
about why, but for the sake of 
this one I’ll keep it concise: Fall 
has this feeling attached to it 
like no other season does. As the 
heavy summer air crystallizes 
into brisk winds, every falling 
leaf is a reminder that all things 
end. That might sound morbid, 
and it certainly doesn’t sound 
enjoyable, but hear me out. Fall 
is the place between things: 
summer and winter, warmth and 
cold, life and death, beginnings 
and endings. In being between 
these things, it manages to 
become all of them. Fall is 
the soft pang of nostalgia for 
something you’re sad is over but 
happy to have experienced — at 
once mournful and joyous. It’s 
trick-or-treating as a 10-year-
old when the world was huge 
and full of adventure. It’s the 
silhouettes of trees standing 
watch in the night. It’s the chill 
of morning fog and the flicker of 
a candle and the quiet beauty of 
falling leaves.
“Dancing in a swirl of golden 
memories, the loveliest lies of 
all.”
That line is a lyric from the 
theme song of “Over the Garden 
Wall” (Nate Cash, “Adventure 
Time”), a Cartoon Network 
miniseries 
that 
features 
10 
episodes, each just over 10 
minutes in length. The series is 
a favorite of mine, and I always 
make a point to re-watch it 
each fall because I have yet to 
find a piece of media that better 
embodies everything that this 
season is to me. The series follows 
Greg (Collin Dean, “Krampus”) 
and Wirt (Elijah Wood, “The 
Trust”) , two brothers who are 
lost in the woods. As they try 
to find their way home, they 
learn that they’ve entered an 
anachronistic other-world called 
The Unknown, and that getting 
home will be no easy task.
While made with a younger 
audience in mind, the series 
places enormous faith in its 
audience to handle a deep 
and 
complex 
storyline 
and 
surprisingly 
dark 
thematic 
material. 
The 
series 
is 

meticulously 
detailed, 
filled 
with a remarkably clever, “blink 
and you’ll miss it” style of mise-
en-scène that rewards repeat 
viewers. This trust in its audience 
is a welcome breath of fresh air, 
and also a part of what makes the 
show enjoyable for all ages. But 
what specifically is it about this 
series that allows it to so acutely 
embody such specific and deeply 
felt emotional qualities?
In short, it’s the world that 
the 
show’s 
creator, 
Patrick 
McHale 
(“Adventure 
Time”), 

has painstakingly crafted. The 
Unknown was inspired heavily 
by American folklore, lending 
the series a vaguely colonial 
aesthetic 
that 
incorporates 
numerous folk legends, from 
the 
man-eating 
Wendigo 
to 
dancing scarecrows. The series 
doesn’t use these oft-obscure 
references as its cornerstone 
for emotional resonance, but 
rather as a background of vague 
familiarity for anyone who grew 
up in the American Northeast, 
Southeast and Midwest. The 
Unknown feels like a place that 
we grew up learning about and 
is inextricably ingrained in our 
culture; the idea of children 
lost in the woods is the basis of 
countless Germanic fairytales, 
and 
it’s 
these 
narrative 
traditions — witches living in 
the woods, people turned into 

animals and the malevolent 
“king of darkness” lurking in 
the shadows — that give rise 
to the quaint Americana that 
has shaped our culture, and are 
recited to children in bedrooms 
across the country.
But it’s not just the world of the 
series that makes it so effective. 
Greg and Wirt are outsiders in 
The Unknown in both a spatial 
and a temporal sense (it’s implied 
the boys are living in the 1970s). 
This far more recent time period, 
not brought into the series until 
the penultimate episode, is the 
emotional anchor of the show 
because it carries the audience 
into this world alongside the 
two brothers. The problems that 
preoccupy Wirt throughout the 
series — an unrequited crush, a 
step-dad who doesn’t seem to get 
him and an annoying younger 
brother — call back to a bygone 
time in many of our lives, a time 
of creeping into graveyards with 
our friends on Halloween, of 
stadium lights over a high school 
football field, of nervously trying 
to figure out who you are. The 
series asks us to simultaneously 
step into this adolescent world 
(one we have left behind) and 
this historical world (one we 
never 
actually 
knew). 
This 
poignant combination evokes 
the 
ambiguous 
in-between 
feeling of fall, and the series is 
appropriately set in the brisk 
days leading to wintertime.
From its soundtrack to its art 
style, everything about “Over the 
Garden Wall” seems to reflect 
wistfully on the inevitability of 
change and transition. In the 
opening moments of the first 
episode, the narrator informs 
the viewer: “Somewhere, lost 
in the clouded annals of history 
lies a place that few have seen. 
A mysterious place called The 
Unknown.” By its conclusion, the 
series seems to suggest that The 
Unknown is not so much a place, 
but a state within each of us; one 
of metamorphosis, where we 
exist as we cease to be one thing 
and begin to become another. 
It’s the place where we push 
ourselves out of the stasis and 
familiarity of the world we know, 
where we discover the promise 
and opportunity that change 
brings to those brave enough to 
climb over the garden wall.

acid and marijuana. He asks the 
question of how to be yourself, 
how to truly exist on your own 
without feeling alone, without 
the aid of substance: “Inhale, in 
hell there’s heaven” he croons, 
finding a sense of paradise 
through THC in an otherwise 
hellish 
state 
of 
solitude. 
Without the stern warning of 
the voicemail, listeners would 
lose that sense of responsibility 
to self that Ocean so carefully, 
so softly conveys. His sweet, 
sweet notes feel all the gentler 
(and all the sadder) for the 
harshness that precede them.
Another R&B artist of in 
the vein of Ocean is Solange 
Knowles, 
whose 
masterful 
A Seat at the Table features 
a 
series 
of 
eight 
separate 
interludes. The first of them, 
“Interlude: The Glory is in You,” 
links the foreboding “Weary” 
with the desperation of “Cranes 
in the Sky.” The interlude is 
only 18 seconds, questioning 
the place that peace has in 
our 
world. 
Unlike 
Ocean’s 
voicemail, 
Knowles’s 
first 
interlude is only a tiny fraction 
of the whole, so diminutive 
it could be easily overlooked 
during a casual listen. But this 
small clip introduces a tangible 
theme in between the poetry of 
the songs that bookend it: “But 
as long you find peace in what 
you doing then you successful, 
and that’s what people don’t 
realize. See, you got do stuff ’till 
where you can go sleep at night. 

’Cause the glory is, is in you.” 
The interlude, in describing 
the need for peace, gives the 
listener an idea of what the “it” 
is in “Cranes in the Sky:” the 
persistent, perfusive aggression 
experienced by minorities, a 
theme that slowly gains layers 
as the album progresses. Where 
Ocean’s interlude provides a 
foil to Blonde’s understated 
loneliness, 
Knowles’s 
works 
in tandem with her music to 
express the pain of racism.
Now the question is raised 
about the role of instrumental 
interludes, 
those 
without 
discernible 
messages 
for 
the listener. Metalcore titan 
Underoath features these types 
of interludes on their two most 
acclaimed albums. The first, 
They Were Only Chasing Safety, 
features “The Blue Note,” which 
splits the album down the 
middle with a jazzy, ambient 
instrumental, 
completely 
disrupting the ferocious energy 
of the preceding “Reinventing 
Your Exit” and drops with a 
“Three, two, one … ” into the 
massive breakdown of “It’s 
Dangerous Business Walking 
Out Your Front Door.” What is 
gained from this nosedive of 
an interlude is not only a way 
transition from one half to the 
next, but it allows an otherwise 
assaulting album to breathe. 
Metalcore 
isn’t 
necessarily 
known for its accessibility, 
and Underoath were pioneers 
in mainstreaming the genre 

with 
the 
release 
of 
this 
record in 2004. The second 
album Define the Great Line 
features 
“Salarmnir,” 
again 
mostly ambient but this time 
including a Psalm read in 
Russian 
accompanied 
by 
rapturous applause that echoes 
through 
the 
background. 
Again, Underoath recognized 
the merits of adding room 
to breathe in an album filled 
with harsh vocals and intense 
breakdowns, this time spicing 
up the formula with epic, 
religious sentiments. Not know 
for their subtlety, Underoath 
draws their fans into the storm 
of their music with an enticing 
interlude 
that 
immediately 
drops the floor beneath the 
listener with a silence before 
“Returning Empty Handed.”
This list could literally go 
on forever and ever, moving 
backwards 
in 
history 
and 
maybe even music of the Middle 
Ages (which would require 
far more research than I am 
capable of), but for now, the 
modern interlude accentuates 
the poetry of music and allows 
a breather from intensity or 
a moment of reflection on 
powerful themes. As music has 
evolved, so has the weight it has 
been able to carry, and, though 
often small in size in today’s 
world, an artful interlude can 
provide just the right amount 
of reprieve to perfectly accent 
an album and the tracks that 
surround it.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘THANK U, NEXT’

Ariana Grande has had a 
hard few years.
It started with the bombing 
during her Manchester Arena 
show. Twenty-three people 
were killed, with many more 
injured. Grande, who has 
always been extremely close 
to her fans, felt “every name.” 
About a year later, Grande 
and 
long-term 
boyfriend 
Mac Miller infamously ended 
their two-year relationship. 
Soon after, Grande entered 
an intense and ultimately 
short-lived 
relationship 
(and engagement) with SNL 
comedian Pete Davidson. On 
Sept. 7, 2018, Mac Miller died 
from what was later ruled as 
an accidental overdose (rest 
in peace, Easy Mac with 
the cheesy raps) and Oct. 14 
saw the end of Davidson’s 
and 
Grande’s 
relationship. 
Tabloids never failed to clutch 
at every one of these events 
like leeches: twisting and 
manipulating and sucking the 
truth out like marrow in order 
to be replaced by whatever 
sold the most copies or got 
the most likes. It seemed that, 
for Grande, there was never 
a moment of peace, a time to 
privately heal.
So, yes, Ariana Grande has 
had a hard few years. Yet, just 

by going off of her newest 
single “thank u, next,” you 
never would have guessed it, 
with optimism and positivity 
encasing every element of the 
song like gold armor. 
The track is similar to 
“no tears left to cry,” which 

broke her silence after the 
Manchester Arena bombing, 
in the sense that both songs 
emerged, resilient, in the 
aftermath of a tragedy and 
both songs showcase not only 
Grande’s 
incredible 
vocal 
range but also her seemingly 
unyielding resolve. Despite 
jumping hurdle after hurdle, 
she never wavers, returning 
time and time again to this 
well of personal strength.
Encased in a twinkling and 
upbeat production, “thank u, 
next” glows. As quiet synths 
and keyboards introduce us 
to the effervescent glide of 
Grande’s first verse, we are 
once again reminded of her 
place as master of all things 
pop music. Delicate, light 
yet still reverberating with a 

hushed fortitude as she sings, 
“Thought I’d end up with 
Sean / But he wasn’t a match 
/ Wrote some songs about 
Ricky / Now I listen and 
laugh,” we are irrevocably 
drawn in, caught by both the 
shimmer and the shine of her 
open, genuine honesty.
“thank u, next” is an 
uncomplicated ode to self-
love. Although Grande takes 
time in focusing on each 
one of her exes, she always 
manages to circle back to 
herself in turn, expressing, 
“I’ve got so much love / Got so 
much patience / I’ve learned 
from the pain / I turned out 
amazing.” Her vocals are 
a gossamer’s touch of self-
reassurance, and, much like 
“no tears left to cry,” much 
like really anything Grande 
has put out or performed 
since she fully matured into 
her own as a pop star, you 
can’t help but revel in the 
power that is exuded note 
after note. Ariana Grande 
says “thank you, next” to 
all that life has thrown at 
her and steps forward into 
growth with sophistication; 
she doesn’t look back.

Fall is the soft

for something 

you’re sad is over

and joyous


A plain white background, 
sometimes textured to look like 
parchment paper. Black text 
in Times New Roman font, or 
perhaps the typewriter-esque 
Courier. Sparse capitalization. 
As short as one line, and no 
more than 15.
This 
is 
the 
aesthetic 
of 
Instagram 
poetry, 
a 
phenomenon in which users 
upload 
images 
of 
short, 
easily-digestible 
poems 
to 
their accounts with hashtags 
such 
as 
#poetryporn, 
#poetrycommunity 
and, 
simply, #poetry. There are 
hundreds of people posting 
images in this tradition, and 
little differentiates one account 
from another.
With 1.1 million followers, @
poets is one of the most highly-
trafficked poetry accounts on 
Instagram. 
The 
anonymous 
moderator of @poets posts 
multiple times a day.
“a reminder #9,” a post from 
Nov. 5 says, “you are allowed / 
to say no / to the things / you 
don’t want / in your life.”
“a 
reminder 
#8,” 
says 
another, “get over it / whatever 
comes / to your mind / when 
you read this, / get over it.”
While 
many 
Instagram 
poetry 
accounts 
are 
unaffiliated 
with 
distinct 
individuals, some pages are run 
by writers who are known for 
their poetry outside the online 
community of their followers. 
Two 
of 
the 
most 
famous 
“Instagram poets,” Rupi Kaur 
and Nayyirah Waheed, have 
made their names as masters 
of bite-sized poetry. Both Kaur 
and Waheed are young women 
of color whose poetry discusses 
femininity, race and sexuality. 
It’s worth mentioning that 
the democratizing nature of 

Instagram has allowed these 
poets to find an audience when 
they otherwise may have been 
unable to.
The primarily white and male 
canon of poetry was assembled 
by 
academics 
who 
would 
condemn 
Instagram 
poetry 
for parading platitudes under 
the banner of profundity — but 
publishers and professors have 
no say over which Instagram 
poets find success. Instead, 
it’s an elusive combination of 
the writer’s talent or aesthetic 
and the audience’s taste that 
elevates some poetry accounts 
over others.
“if you are not enough for 
yourself / you will never be 
enough / for someone else,” 
writes Kaur, who has 3.2 
million followers on Instagram. 
Her simple verse has spurred 
numerous 
mockeries, 
most 
notably “Milk and Vine,” a 
parody of her 2014 book “Milk 
and Honey.” “i love you bitch 
/ i ain’t ever gonna stop loving 
you / bitch,” reads one such 
imitation, 
quoting 
a 
well-
known Vine.
These satires are funny in 
a way that calls into question 
the 
emotional 
authenticity 
of Kaur’s work. The most 
common 
complaint 
about 
Kaur’s poetry — and Instagram 
poetry as a genre — is that it 
is too general, too sentimental 
and too easy. By co-opting 
the most universal emotions 
— 
love, 
heartbreak, 
anger, 
hope, pain — and whittling 
them down, Instagram poems 
often fall prey to cliché. The 
Modernists would hate this 
stuff, but so many people love 
it, and I understand why.
I’ll be honest: I think a lot of 
Instagram poetry — including 
Kaur’s work — is pretty terrible. 
“my expectations / kill me / 
more than / anything else,” 
reads one particularly bad post 
by @poets. “She conquered 

all her demons / and wore her 
scars like wings,” says another 
from @atticuspoetry.
In our oversaturated world, 
it’s easy to see why people are 
drawn to the calm simplicity 
of this genre and its insistent 
distillation 
of 
language 
and 
design. 
We 
shouldn’t 
ask Instagram poetry to be 
something it’s not: it’s short 
and sweet, or short and inane 
or short and obvious. These 
poems aren’t trying to be 
Gertrude Stein’s “Patriarchal 
Poetry.” Like many Instagram 
poems, “Patriarchal Poetry” 
deals 
with 
feminism 
and 
femininity.
“Let her be to be to be to be 
let her be to be to be let her to 
be let her to / be let her be to 
be when is it that they are shy. 
Very well to try. / Let her be 
that is to be let her be that is to 
be let her be let her try. Let her 
be let her be let her be to be to 
be shy let her be to be let her be 
/ to be let her try. / Let her try. 
/ Let her be let her be let her be 
let her be to be to be let her be 
let her try. / To be shy,” writes 
Stein, an author whose work 
is the polar opposite of the 
Instagram poets’: dense, long, 
intellectually 
challenging. 
But who is to say that Stein’s 
work is inherently better than 
Kaur’s? Instagram poets are a 
product of our time, appealing 
to our desire for immediate 
insight and for someone else to 
articulate our emotions.
It 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
characterize 
all 
Instagram 
poetry as vapid and faux-
intellectual. Like any genre, 
some 
practitioners 
will 
be 
better 
than 
others. 
Does 
it 
really 
matter 
whether 
Instagram poets are talented 
according 
to 
old 
measures 
of literary dexterity? These 
writers have made poetry cool 
again, a feat in and of itself. 
That’s good enough for me.

This past Saturday night, 
my friend Luca and I quietly 
stood on the sticky floor of a 
house party kitchen as our 
other friend, Lucas, joined a 
gut-wrenchingly 
predictable 
conversation, starting with the 
discovery that he and another 
girl both lived in Markley.
“A thousand slight variations 
on 
this 
exact 
conversation 
are happening all around this 
campus right now,” Luca leaned 
into me and remarked. I laughed, 
partly because it was true and 
partly because I couldn’t believe 
I hadn’t had the same thought 
before. “How about we just go 
up to people and say ridiculous 
things and see how they react?” 
I proposed. He enthusiastically 
laughed, egging me on.
But I didn’t do it. Why not? 
Well, I froze up on thinking of 
things to even say to people. I’m 
just not accustomed to thinking 
of specific topics on the fly like 
that. Realistically, I’m just far 
too shy to do this anyway.

That’s a shame. Going out at 
night, we hope for dance floor 
glory, engaged conversation and 
thrills and spills that we won’t 
soon forget. We see images 
on Instagram, Facebook and 
Tinder that serve to capture 
these 
moments 
and 
briefly 
summarize the night. But lately, 
it 
has 
become 
increasingly 
obvious to me that a lot of posts 
I see are mere “I’m still here!” 
attention grabs.
“I don’t like posting the 
next day unless I actually had 
fun that night,” my friend 
Natalie told me on the subject. 
I agreed, though my posting is 
inconsistent regardless of how 
much fun I have while out. 
What one can be sure to see 
on Instagram, however, is the 
same group of two or three gals 
cuddled up next to each other on 
elevated platforms during game 
days, even though each one of 
them has specifically told me 
how much they hate tailgating.
Let’s be more real with 
ourselves! Small talk is small 
talk: It has always existed and 
always 
will 
in 
classrooms, 
office settings, house parties, 

etc. 
It’s 
bite-sized 
in 
how 
much it communicates, but it’s 
necessary. But let’s not let that 
translate into social media, too. 
Social media should be less 
about artificially checking in 
with our friends through our 
likes and comments, and more 
about those rare times when you 
really stop at a post and think 
to yourself, “Hey, I actually 
want to know how this person 
is doing.”
Likes and comments can be 
a real rush and posting often 
will only cause your followers 
to proliferate, but what social 
media is really about is keeping 
friendships 
that 
transcend 
the barriers of time and space. 
Think of the power that comes 
with turning off “read receipts.”
There’s no doubt that social 
media presence is invaluable 
for modern day influencers, but 
what are you really influencing 
when 
you 
constantly 
post 
pictures with nothing more than 
emojis and relatable slogans? 
Social media is meant to be for 
friends. Let’s not force ourselves 
to do any more small-talking 
than we have to.

Between 
literary 
journals 
unable 
to 
pay 
fiction 
contributors and the rocky 
year-to-year sales numbers for 
first-time 
story 
collections, 
the short story appears to be 
in perpetual jeopardy. “Too 
often,” writes Adrian Lee of 
Maclean’s, “short fiction is 
dismissed as a staging ground 
for the ultimate goal: writing 
a novel.” Simultaneously, it is 
indeed the novel that literary 
and commercial focus seems to 
center on.
Whether the short story is 
withering or not, the questions 
this 
uncertainty 
raises 
regarding the value of short 
fiction are indeed rational. 
Why shouldn’t an author just 
craft a novel — a work more 
marketable, more ubiquitously 
accessible — instead? Yes, short 
fiction 
has 
been 
effective, 
but why not stretch it into 
something more impactful?
Recently, I came across these 
questions myself while reading 
“Modal 
Window” 
by 
Janet 
Towle. The story, aptly named 

and finished in 20 minutes 
of reading, circumvents the 
closure and wholeness usually 
implicit in fiction. 
Ten stories in one, 
“Modal Window” 
hurries 
through 
glimpses into 11 
narratives 
in 
a 
span of 12 pages — 
a gay man’s place 
at 
a 
Christmas 
family gathering, 
a young woman 
moored 
by 
a 
broken 
car, 
a 
courtyard on a 
college campus, a 
street-performer 
covered 
in 
metallic 
paint. 
After 
a 
brief 
immersion 
into 
these 
spaces, 
readers are met 
repeatedly 
with 
the same line — 
“This is a modal 
window” 
— 
at 
which the scene 
is 
torn 
away, 
moving to the next narrative.
This 
function 
of 
brevity 
in 
“Modal 
Window” 
is 
a 
familiar one to short fiction 

enthusiasts. Brief excavations 
into a story are, after all, 
implicit in the descriptor: short 
fiction. 
“Modal 
Window” seems 
to 
challenge 
the 
fallibility 
of short fiction 
with its newly 
transitory 
narratives. 
Stuck in all of 
the 10 storylines 
Towle created, I 
began to wonder 
the 
effect 
that 
“Modal 
Window” would 
have had it been 
stretched 
into 
a 
novel. 
And 
the 
answer 
is — wholly in 
defense of the 
short story — not 
nearly enough of 
one.
The 
“short” 
feature of short 
fiction may seem 
to be a limiting 
factor, 
but 
its 
conciseness 
instead provides constructive 
and unique benefits. Indeed, 
while the novel brags tangible 

length, breadth may not quite 
articulate 
intimacy. 
Brief 
fiction leaves less space for 
detail, 
language 
and, 
most 
importantly, 
less 
space 
for 
readers to know a character. 
Unlike longer works, where 
readers are allocated hundreds 
of pages to cognize and identify 
with a narrative, we are left 
with a relatively small period to 
do so in short stories.
This format creates a unique 
flavor of intimacy. With such 
limited resources, readers are 
forced to lean into the space 
of a story, to a greater extent 
than they would with a novel, 
grappling for an understanding 
within the environment they 
are given. In reading Towle’s 
work, this act became conscious 
for me: Expecting the abrupt 
end of each narrative, I was left 
saturated with each section’s 
characters’ emotions, yearning 
to understand and feel with 
them before they were taken 
from me.
Though the success of short 
fiction extends beyond this 
required closeness. The short 
story has been coveted for 
hundreds of years because it 
can impact us in ways other

mediums can’t. In the days 
after reading “Modal Window,” 
I 
found 
myself 
repeatedly 
contemplating the scenarios I 
had been immersed in — such 
as that of friends, reunited and 
camping, or that of a woman 
desperate 
to 
make 
money 
through her performance art. 
More than immersed, I was 
subconsciously determined to 
comprehend these characters. 
Given 
such 
a 
brief 
but 
emotionally drenched glimpse 
into the world of others altered 
my worldview in the following 
days. Whereas a novel often 
gives readers a more complete 
look at scenarios, the reduced 
space of a short story remains 
open-ended, 
requiring 
immense contemplation before 
and after reading.
This tangible impact points 
to the fact that short fiction 
has the ability to weigh more 
on readers than other mediums 
within 
art 
and 
knowledge. 
Short 
stories 
offer 
more 
personal 
indulgances 
than 
mere facts can: The multitude 
of perspectives and emotional 
devices that stories offer us 
create impacts stronger than 
non-narrative facts do. And a 
lack of a complete backstory 
or prior knowledge — such as 
that provided with anecdotal 
biopics or longer works — 
allows readers to intuit the 
story 
themselves. 
Removed 
from real-world personhood, 

from history, from tangible 
logic, these snippets allow us to 
view the world from a different 
sort of fact — one containing 
all of the devices of art, but one 
allowing us to understand them 
entirely as ourselves. We more 
easily internalize short fiction.
Thus, in the contemporary 
fight for literary significance, 
to 
those 
questioning 
the 
constriction 
of 
the 
“short” 
aspect of short fiction: Its 
length provides its own set of 
benefits to readers. The cosmos 
of a short story could not be 
stretched to a novel. With such 
extrapolation, we would lose 
the intimacy bite-sized fiction 
requires, 
the 
intrapersonal 
view it extends and the post-
reading contemplation it urges. 
As a novel, “Modal Window” 
would have given me a near-
complete view of personhood 
in each scene, disregarding the 
closeness and yearning that 
readers are allowed as a result.
Like all literature, this short 
prose, which is accessible in a 
15 minute sit-down in a coffee 
house, 
extends 
to 
readers 
delicate cross-sections of the 
world we live in, but cannot 
experience. The short story is 
an intrinsic part of the literary 
world. If the humanities teach 
us how to live and die, then it is 
the intimacy and perspective of 
short fiction that can teach us 
how to do so in relation to other 
people.

With such 

limited 

resources, 

readers are 

forced to lean 

into the space 

of a story, to a 

greater extent 

than they 

would with a

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘FUKK SLEEP’

Shortly after announcing 
the 
“Injured 
Generation” 
tour for his latest album 
Testing, 
A$AP 
Rocky 
released the music video for 
“Fukk Sleep.”
“Fukk Sleep” is one of 
Testing’s 
more 
accessible 
tracks; the beat is run-of-
the-mill trap and Rocky’s 
vocals are unprecedentedly 
auto-tuned, following with 
the most omnipresent trend 
in rap today. The song’s 
music video mirrors this 

accessibility. 
Unlike 
past 
Rocky 
videos, 
which 
are 
typically cryptic and visually 

marvelous (see: “L$D” and 
“A$AP 
Forever”), 
“Fukk 
Sleep” doesn’t stray too far 

from the stereotypical hip-
hop video: Rocky mimes the 
song’s lyrics with swagger as 
he and FKA Twigs (featured 
on the song) wreak havoc on a 
futuristic New York City, and 
that’s pretty much it. There 
are no acid-dipped scenes 
with metaphysical twists or 
adventurous camera paths 
that take you in and out of 
reality.

BOOKS NOTEBOOK


They say good things come in 
small packages. A diamond ring 
in a Tiffany’s box, everlasting love 
and cuddles from a young puppy, 
unconditional 
friendship 
from 
the 5’1” fireball you call your best 
friend. We find so much wonder 
in grandeur and greatness that we 
often ignore the small things in life 
making every day a little better.
This sentiment remains when 
it comes to the places we choose 
to spend our time. Call me crazy, 
but I’d prefer a studio apartment 
in New York City to a mansion 
in Texas any day. We are told 
to “think big” and “go big or go 
home,” but why? Why get lost in 
a labyrinth of open space when 
a cozy, personalized place is 
waiting for you, opening its arms 
to welcome you in.
In 
Ann 
Arbor, 
there 
are 
plenty of snug spots peppered 
throughout campus and around 
Main St., all with their own 
flair and unique elements. One 
common thread between many 
of these homey hubs is their size: 
small — minuscule, even. There’s 
something about a comfortably 
tight space that heightens a sense 
of intimacy, a sense that this place 
is yours and no one else’s.
Tucked around the corner of 
a strip mall-like building on East 
Huron, covered in fall decor, 
stands Tasty Bakery: a gluten-free 
bakery owned by husband and 
wife duo Julie and Ran Rabinovitz. 
When I walked in, the first thing I 
noticed wasn’t the size; it was the 
feeling the place gave me. Every 
detail was added for a reason, from 
the hand-drawn tags marking 
the baked goods in the case, to 
the trinkets placed on a vintage 
white vanity. Everything worked 
off of everything else: The red and 
white twine connecting the labels 
complimented the red clock and 
chairs by the window. Even the 
freshly baked treats in the display 
seemed like they were all a part of 
the design.
When I sat down to talk to 
Julie Rabinovitz — who started 
the business at the Ann Arbor 
Farmer’s Market in May 2009 — 

it was like sitting down with an 
old friend. She is pleasant, joyous 
and friendly, everything you’d 
expect from someone that makes 
delicious sweets and snacks for a 
living.
Rabinovitz 
initially 
worked 
in graphic design and lived in 
Brooklyn, but when the couple had 
their first son and decided to move 
to Ann Arbor, she decided to finally 
listen to her grandmother’s advice 
and become a full-time baker.
“I started at the farmers market 
but as I went on I started picking 
up stores,” Rabinovitz said in an 

interview with The Daily. “I was 
by myself at the time and Lab Cafe 
was the first place I got. At the 
time, my husband was changing 
jobs and decided he wanted to 
help, so we became a family-
owned business and now our 
products are sold in about 18 cafes 
and stores around Ann Arbor.”
Although 
they 
loved 
the 
farmer’s 
market, 
the 
couple 
thought it was time they set up a 
permanent location. And a little 
over three years ago, they got 
lucky and found the perfect spot.
“It was something we wanted 
to do for a while,” she said. “I had 
a vision for what I wanted and I 
knew exactly the font I wanted 
for my logo and I knew the colors 
I wanted to use and what I wanted 
the place to look like.”
Now that they have their 
location, the couple makes it as 
personalized as possible.
“For a long time, we had 
people at the market asking us: 

‘Where’s your place?’ We are able 
to offer more here and give an 
environment for people to come 
and see what we do,” she said. 
“We welcome people back into our 
kitchen and we are able to really 
talk to them.”
Another thing that sets the 
bakery apart is their baking 
methods. Tasty Bakery is a 
completely gluten-free kitchen 
and accommodates other allergies 
as well. They offer a variety of 
vegan options and use the best 
ingredients they can find.
“We 
use 
really 
high-end 
ingredients 
and 
use 
organic 
wherever 
we 
can 
find 
it,” 
Rabinovitz said. “We use healthier 
ingredients like organic coconut 
oil, olive oil, things that are just 
better for you.”
An important pillar of the 
bakery is to make food that 
absolutely everyone can enjoy, no 
matter disease or allergy.
“Our 
vegan 
things 
are 
sweetened with organic coconut 
sugar or nectar, which is low 
glycemic so most diabetics can 
enjoy it too,” Rabinovitz said. “We 
really try to accommodate most 
allergies so we really personalize 
in that respect.”
When they can, the Rabinovitz 
couple 
uses 
locally 
made 
products, such as peanut butter 
from Traverse City, fruits and 
vegetables 
from 
the 
farmers 
market and chocolate from Mindo 
chocolate makers in Dexter.
Rabinovitz said their baking 
methods are often what makes 
them so close with customers.
“I’ll talk to someone for hours 
when they come in,” she said. 
“Because of what we do, because 
we work with people that do have 
health issues we talk a lot to people 
about health and what they can eat 
and what they can’t, and how that 
affects them.”
Even if you don’t have an 
allergy or dietary restriction, you 
shouldn’t be discouraged from 
eating at this delightful bakery. 
Just a short conversation with Ran 
or Julie or a bite of their delicious 
sweets will brighten up your entire 
day. They may not be big but they 
sure are mighty, and this little Ann 
Arbor gem is here to make that 
known.

TV NOTEBOOK
Are anthology shows the new future of television?

Last Dec., CBS announced it 
was working on a new Jordan 
Peele-produced sci-fi anthology 
series to be released on CBS All-
Access, the network’s streaming 
site, in 2019. Pretty quickly, 
more names were attached to 
the project — Sanaa Lathan 
(“Nappily Ever After”) is set to 
star in one episode, Adam Scott 
(“The Good Place”) in another. 
Peele, who won an Oscar last 
year for directing “Get Out,” says 
he hopes the show will “hold a 
mirror up to our society.”
It seems like this is TV’s new 
modus operandi: experimental 
shows that transform themselves 
season-to-season 
or 
— 
even 
more ambitiously — episode-
to-episode, replete with star-
studded 
casts 
and 
weighty 
themes. With a few exceptions, 
they’re gripping and subversive, 
crafting miniature worlds and 
rules for viewers to familiarize 
themselves 
with 
before 
scrapping them and dreaming 
up something new. There are a 
handful of anthologies on the 
air now, and another bunch in 
the works, spanning genres from 
true-crime to romantic comedy 
to horror. It’s worth wondering: 
Are anthology shows the next big 
thing in TV?
Not so fast. That Jordan 
Peele sci-fi series? It’s actually a 
revival of “The Twilight Zone,” 
the famed paranormal anthology 
that ran on CBS some 50-years-

ago. The anthology show isn’t so 
much a new phenomenon as it is 
a very old one. But the conditions 
that have made the anthology 
popular again are new. The rise 
of Netflix has hurtled us all 
into the streaming age, where 
creators are unencumbered by 
ratings pressure and free to test 
out niche offerings. And some 
combination of shorter episode 
orders and the small screen’s 
increased prestige has big-name 
artists flocking to a medium 
that’s no longer the onerous 
obligation it once was.
Anthology television seems 
to make everything easier. It’s 
low-commitment for actors and 
directors, and it’s great for the 
poor victims of TV’s golden age: 
us viewers, forced to sift through 
heaps of content without the time 
to watch any of it. The anthology 
lets us cherry pick what we want 
and skip what we don’t, with 
absolutely no consequences.
I don’t care much for the 
faux insight of “Black Mirror,” 
Netflix’s 
dystopic 
anthology 
about the consequences of new 
technology, which the writer 
Daniel 
Ortberg 
summed 
up 
nicely as: “What if phones, but too 
much?” I did, however, love the 
third season’s “San Junipero,” 
a stylish, tender episode with a 
rare (for “Black Mirror”) happy 
ending. It was better for the fact 
that I didn’t need to slog through 
the rest of the show to get to it 
— like getting dessert without 
having to eat my vegetables.
That satisfaction of a well-
crafted anthology chapter is the 

same satisfaction we get from 
reading a good short story. Some 
have punchy, shocking endings 
to rival “A Rose for Emily,” 
while others favor the creeping 
tension of “The Lottery.” A few 
anthologies do draw directly 
from short story collections — 
Amazon’s 
“Electric 
Dreams” 
adapts the works of Philip K. 
Dick; Indian channel Epic aired 
a series based on the writings of 
Rabindranath Tagore. Networks, 
if you’re reading, Kate Chopin’s 
tragic vignettes of domestic life 
are practically screaming to 
be made into a TV miniseries. 
NBC? Hulu? Crackle? Frito-Lay? 
Someone, please do this.
Some anthology series, like 
those based on short fiction 
collections, are bound together 
only by a common author. 
Netflix, for instance, recently 
announced 
a 
forthcoming 
Dolly Parton anthology series, 
each chapter based on a song 
of hers — “Jolene” will be first, 
of course. Others have more 
inventive connective tissue — on 
HBO’s “High Maintenance,” a 
shared pot dealer is the degree 
of 
separation 
one 
episode’s 
characters have from another’s. 
TBS’s 
“The 
Guest 
Book” 
follows 
different 
vacationers 
at a mountain cottage, while 
the BBC’s “Inside No. 9” tells 
the stories of all sorts of people 
living at addresses beginning 
with “nine.”
Season-long 
anthologies, 
a 
somewhat newer model, tend to 
operate around much broader 
themes, 
each 
season 
telling

its own self-contained story, 
sometimes with the same cast 
as the previous season’s. The 
pioneer and biggest purveyor of 
these is none other than Ryan 
Murphy, who has three on air 
now: “American Horror Story,” 
“American Crime Story” and 
“Feud.” It’s an almost too-good-
to-be-true format for Murphy, 
who grows bored with his own 
premises 
quickly 
and 
does 
his best work when given the 
freedom to reinvent.
It’s an almost too-bad-to-
be-true format for Matthew 
Weiner, whose dreadful post-
“Mad Men” anthology project 
“The 
Romanoffs,” 
new 
on 
Amazon, is a reminder of how 
difficult anthology storytelling 
can be. In the interest of telling 
complete stories in one chapter, 

anthology episodes are prone 
to clunky exposition dumps, 
doing more telling than showing. 
And in trying to say everything 
they intend to, they also run the 
risk of being overly long — each 
episode of “The Romanoffs” 
clocks in at a soul-crushing 90 
minutes, a crime for a style of TV 
that should be as pleasant and 
effortless as candy dissolving on 
the tongue.
There is also the sense that 
with anthology TV we lose the 
emotional connection serialized 
television 
fosters. 
We 
can’t 
experience 
the 
pleasure 
of 
rewarding 
character 
growth, 
or slow-burning chemistry or 
winking 
self-reference. 
That 
isn’t always the case (see again, 
“San Junipero”), but there’s 
some truth to it.

Some of the best TV episodes 
of the last few years have been 
compromises 
between 
these 
two poles: the flexibility of 
the 
anthology 
episode 
and 
the 
poignancy 
of 
serialized 
television. 
They’re 
what 
is 
known as bottle episodes — 
experimental, 
dialogue-heavy 
standalone episodes removed 
from a show’s regular continuity. 
“Girls” did them to great success; 
“BoJack Horseman” has had 
several, one entirely underwater, 
another a 25-minute eulogy. The 
third season of “Breaking Bad” 
features a famous bottle episode 
all about trying to catch a fly. 
That’s what should be the next 
big thing: television that enters 
— as the original “The Twilight 
Zone” put it — “the wondrous 
dimension of imagination.”
