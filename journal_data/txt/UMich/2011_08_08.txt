'U' hires
new DPS
director
Ann Arbor local
Greg O'Dell hired six
months after former
chief's medical leave
By SARAH ALSADEN
Daily News Editor
After months of searching for a
replacement for the position, Greg
O'Dell, former chief of police at
Eastern Michigan University, has
been hired as executive director
of the University's Department of
Public Safety.
O'Dell will begin his appoint-
ment on Aug. 22, according to Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald.
He will be replacing DPS Police
Captain Joe Piersante who is cur-
rently serving as interim public
safety director after former DPS
Chief of Police Ken Magee took a
medical leave of absence in Febru-
ary. Magee will remain on leave
and retain his title and salary until
O'Dell begins, according to Fitzger-
ald.
O'Dell's position will entail
overseeing and directing "crime
prevention, law enforcement, and
safety and security services of the
University," according to an Aug. 1
University press release. Fitzgerald
said he believes O'Dell's experience
and knowledge of the city will aid
him in accomplishing these tasks.
"He's got that great combina-
tion of deep knowledge of the Ann
Arbor community and the police
in this community specifically,"

FINANCING YOUR EDUCATION
Debt deal to eliminate some
graduate student loan funds

University officials
unsure of how
federal cuts will
affect enrollment
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Graduate students who
depend on Direct Subsidized
Federal Loans to help finance
their education may encounter
problems as a result of the fed-
eral government's debt ceiling

bill that plans to stop allocating
funds to the program.
In a measure expected to
save the federal government $18
billion dollars, the agreement is
set to end the loan program -
which pays the interest on loans
collected by students while still
attending school - for graduate
and professional students start-
ing July 1, 2012.
Additionally, the settlement
will discontinue loan payment
incentives - percentage-based
rebates that graduate students
can earn after 12 successive
punctual loan repayments -

starting in July 2012.
After weeks of wrangling
between President Barack
Obama and top GOP officials,
the two provisions seemed to
amount to necessary conces-
sions for Democrats, who had
rebuffed Republican calls to end
the Direct Subsidized Federal
Loan program since President
Obama met with Republicans at
the White House in early July.
Last week, student financial
aid advocacy groups around the
nation expressed fear that the
end of these programs would

New 7-Eleven to open on Main Street

Company plans
to further expand
chain within the
Ann Arbor area
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Slurpee fanatics and taquito
lovers will soon have another
haven in downtown Ann Arbor as
a 7-Eleven convenience store on
Main Street prepares to open in
the third week of August.
7-Eleven spokeswoman Mar-
garet Chabris wrote in an e-mail
interview that the new store -
located at 704 South Main Street
- will offer students and resi-
dents of Ann Arbor the "normal
assortment of products" sold at
the chain, as well as round the
clock convenience and employ-
ment opportunities.
After opening two stores in
Ann Arbor in the past year, Cha-
bris said the 7-Eleven chain hopes
to continue to expand in the area
in the coming years.
She added the other down-
town 7-Eleven store - which
opened in January on South State

7-Eleven opened a location on State Street this past January.

Jaboro said.
Jim Smith, owner of Washt-
enaw Dairy located on South Ash-
ley Street just a block away from
the new 7-Eleven store, said he
can't rely on distance to decrease
competition between the two
stores.
While Smith said the opening
of the 7-Eleven would most likely
impact his beverage sales, he said
he anticipates that his store's spe-
cialties will continue to maintain
his customer base and business.
"We are not like a big party
store," Smith said. "We are more
of a family place - they come
down to eat ice cream and donuts
and coffee and stuff like that.
We've got a lot of loyal customers
... people have come down here
for years."
However, Smith said he still
maintains a positive attitude in
light of the new competition his
store faces.
"They're a big outfit, so they
can open up anywhere they want
really," Smith said. "I'm not
upset about it. I mean everything
changes, life changes every day.
You can't get upset over people
doing business. Everybody wants
to do more business so that's just
the way the world is."

Street - has been successful thus
far and has met the expectations
of the chain.
7-Eleven first became inter-
ested in developing in the Ann
Arbor area after their Michi-
gan real estate director, who
had previously lived in the area,
saw potential for growth for the
chain, according to Chabris.
Though the chain is increas-
ing its presence in downtown Ann
Arbor, independent convenience
stores said they do not anticipate
much of a decrease in their sales.
Jerome Kamano, owner of
Diag Party Shoppe on South State

Street, said he has seen little
change in business since 7-Eleven
opened down the street from his
shop, adding the store has built
a "good clientele" in its 21-year
existence.
Similarly, Maher Jaboro, co-
owner of A & L Wine Castle on
West Stadium Boulevard, said he
supports the opening of the new.
7-Eleven on Main Street since its
distance from his store most like-
ly will not hinder his business.
"I think downtown needs
something like a 7-Eleven, but
again, if I was down the road
it would be a different story,"

'U' and Michigan Nurses Association in negotiations

Officials are
optimistic MNA and
UMHS will come to
an agreement
By AUSTIN WORDELL
Daily StaffReporter
The University has encoun-
tered increased resistance from
the Michigan Nurses Association,
which recently claimed in an
amended complaint the Univer-
sity has been unfairly changing
labor practices involving health
insurance without consulting
them.

Despite failures to reach a
compromise over issues in the
past involving benefits and salary
changes, both parties expressed
optimism that they would come
to an agreement on the contracts
when negotiations began on Aug.
3.
The disagreements over the
contract come on the heels of a
grievance against the Univer-
sity filed by the MNA on June 21,
charging unfair labor practices,
according to a July 8 article in
The Michigan Daily. Specifi-
cally, the complaint dealt with
an announcement by University
of Michigan Health System that
it would alter six nurses' sched-
ules without first negotiating the

changes with the MNA.
According to Ann Sincox of
the Michigan Nurses Association,
the union hopes that the negotia-
tions will benefit both the nurses
and UMHS, and continue to fos-
ter a program that draws high
quality nurses to the University.
"We believe that (UMHS) is
also concerned about providing
world-class patient care," Sin-
cox said. "Our goal is to reach an
agreement that allows UMHS to
attract the high-caliber nurses
necessary to care for the patients
at UMHS."
She added that she believes
negotiations will ultimately end
in an agreement that will satisfy
both sides.

"We have a long relationship
with UMHS and are confident
that we will be able to reach an
agreement that will support the
nurses ability to continue provid-
ing quality patient care," Sincox
said.
Sincox said the nurses union
claims that the proposed changes
to nurses' health care benefits
would compromise the hospital's
ability to attract and maintain a
top nursing staff.
"The key issues in the con-
tract revolve around the ability
of (University) nurses to continue
providing safe, quality patient
care both now and in the future,"
Sincox said. "These nurses are
being asked to take substantial

cuts in benefits and to pay more
for their health insurance ... If
you cannot attract and keep the
nurses who fit (the University's)
high standards, then patient care
will be affected not only now, but
in the future."
According to Steven Strahl,
a registered nurse at the Uni-
versity and member of the bar-
gaining team, when benefits are
decreased, quality care may be
compromised since potentially
less high-quality nurses will be
interested in working for the Uni-
versity.
"(The University) is a world-
known health care institution,"
Strahl said. "People come from

University team hopes to expand
digital freedom through program

Telex system aims
to increase Internet
access abroad
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Though Internet access is
essentially unrestricted in the
United States, citizens in other
countries do not always have free-
range over its resources due to
usage restrictions imposed by their
governments - an issue a group of
University students is trying to alle-
viate.
Alex Halderman, assistant pro-
fessor of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science at the Uni-
versity, and graduate students Eric
Wustrow and Scott Wolchok are
aiming to make digital freedom a
global right with their newly devel-
oped Telex system.
Telex, which began develop-
ment in fall 2010, aims to serve
as a prototype to end the "cat and
mouse game" between proxy site
users and restrictive governments,
Wolchok said, since citizens in
Internet-restricted countries must
use proxy websites in order to visit
banned addresses.
According to Wustrow, Telex
is a two-part system where users

download software that allows
Telex stations to act as a proxy site
outside of the restricted country.
He noted that one major difference
between a typical proxy website
and Telex is that proxy websites
often have only one IP address that
needs to be blocked, but Telex will
have multiple addresses, making
censorship very difficult.
Wustrow added there are only
a handful of undersea cables to
China, but Telex stations would be
sufficient for the program to work
there. Nonetheless, there are still
several hurdles to the implementa-
tion of this program.
For example, Wustrow said
there is no definitive price, but each
Telex station could cost thousands
of dollars and the stations would
have to be incentivized for Internet
Service Providers to install them.
He added that in return for install-
ing Telex stations, ISPs could sell
the service to users to subsidize
costs or the U.S. government could
sponsor efforts toward increased
Internet freedom.
According to the United King-
dom technology website www.
theregister.com, the U.S. govern-
ment supported a similar program
called Anonymiser in 2003, which
aimed to provide an insurmount-
able number of proxies for Ira-
nian citizens. However, Wustrow

City Council shouldn't act as cultural police
Ann Arbor City Council is yet again trying to dictate the
activities of downtown businesses. After closing The
Fifth Quarter and attempting to close Dream Nite Club,
City Council is taking an even more controlling stance by forcing
a soon to be opened store, Bongs and Thongs, to alter the mer-
chandise it plans on selling. In an attempt to make the store's
products more "community-friendly," City Council is citing an
obscure ordinance that limits the sale of sexual paraphernalia.
City Council should not micromanage store inventories, espe-
cially if they are following legitimate laws, and it shouldn't dig
up age-old ordinances to impede stores that carry merchan-

ning's character gets fed up with
the sustainability trend and goes
on this rant: "I just can't with the
hemp milk and the organic farm-
ing. If I bear one more person say
they love heirloom tomatoes, I'm
gonna kill myself. Do you know
that we're composting now? 'Oh no,
don't throw that in the trash. You
have to put that in the composting
bin where all the beautiful little
worms will turn it into organic
mulch and then we'll all feel good
about ourselves."' While watching
it I realized that Annette Benning
was right.
This "holier-than-thou" mental-
ity is a prevailing one in Ann Arbor.
Many of the fancy, Main Street res-
taurants have menus packed with
descriptions of every ingredient,
some even including the farm of
origin. A handful of those places
also boast a beer and spirits selec-
tion that consist entirely of locally
brewed or manufactured alcohol
and it's most certainly a point of
pride for those establishments.
But does that give them the right
to criticize other places that do
not follow the same policy? Does it
mean Michigan beers are somehow
better or that organic heirloom
tomatoes taste better? Not neces-
sarily. It's a matter of opinion.
"Organic" might carry different
connotations depending on where
you use the word. In Ann Arbor it
is praised, but elsewhere it may be
regarded as pompous, simply label-
ing something different * for the
sake of increasing the price. Keep
in mind that "organic" for food only
means a harsher set of FDA stan-
dards for production and distribu-
tion of the product and there still
is insufficient evidence to support
the claim that organic food is safer,
healthier or better tasting than
conventionally grown foods.
We're very satisfied whenever
we mention our responsible choic-
es, but sometimes that stinks of

arrogance. That also applies to the
general sustainability movement,
especially when it's billed as a hip,
life-changing decision. I'm not
arguing about the movement itself.
Taking steps toward saving the
Earth is absolutely the right choice.
However, since its nascence, the
sustain-ability initiative has been
a somewhat hideous creature, a
many-headed beast dividing Amer-
icans between partisan lines and
revealing our many faults - the
most salient being not everyone
can afford to be green. Sustain-
ability is often publicized as a rich
man's endeavor. Yes, we are still

Arbor, recyclingisn't always easy. A
wide variety of items, such as sty-
rofoam, are accepted here, but not
elsewhere. In cities where waste
management doesn't have adequate
resources, you have to make a con-
certed effort to dispose of recy-
clables. Similarly, local farmers'
markets might seem like the best
choice when it comes to purchas-
ing your-produce, but there aren't
farmers' markets everywhere. And
the difference in price that might
seem infinitesimal to us may be
enough, to outweigh the benefits of
the farm-to-dinner table option.
However, there are also plenty of
sustainable solutions as simple as
unplugging your electronics after
using them and taking the bus. You
don't have to go so far as to buy a
hybrid car, solar panels and a wind
turbine. Having those items doesn't
mean you're saving the planet that
much more than the other guy.
The problem is that local, organic
food and sustainability are far too
often promoted as an alternative
lifestyle when it should be integrat-
ed into normal lifestyle. But that

to create change without an air of

dise restrictions.
Bongs and Thongs is not engag-
ing in anything illegal. City Coun-
cil is condemning the store before
its doors have even opened, forc-
inga store to change its inventory.
Ann Arbor should allow stores to
exist, regardless of how outland-
ish or socially controversial their
products may be. If purchas-
ing thongs were illegal, or if the
store were causing crime rates to
increase, City Council might have
had a more legitimate case against
the store. In reality, however, the
city is blocking the new business
not because of serious legal issues,
but rather due to its easily offend-
ed sensibilities.
The law that the city is citing
was created in 1978 and limited
the sale of genital-like objects and
sexually stimulating products to
less than 20 percent of merchan-
dise. There are many old ordi-

nances that the city could invoke
to prevent all kinds' of different
activities, but do not because they
are largely vestigial or utterly
obsolete, such as anordinancethat
prevents bowling between 12:00
a.m. and 7:00 a.m. The law being
cited to dictate merchandise sales
at Bongs and Thongs is completely
arbitrary and doesn't reflect any
current state or federal law. The
City Council should not block the
opening of a store that does not
violate any legitimate statute.
Worse than the citation of out-
dated ordinances, though, is that
store owner Kilo Hassan is up
against the close-mindedness of
a city that usually has an open
mind. In this case, the law is sim-
ply being used as an excuse to get
rid of a store that sells cultural
oddities. While there maybe some
valid concerns about the opening

of a marijuana-friendly, sexuali-
ty-enhancing store in downtown
Ann Arbor, the real problem
seems to be that people are sim-
ply uncomfortable being around
such a store. The U.S. prides itself
on having free enterprise, and it is
Hassan's right to run a business,
provided the products sold are
legal. If this store is going to be
a bane to Ann Arbor, people can
avoid it and it will go out of busi-
ness. If it does well, then it proves
that the citizens of this town actu-
ally welcome a store that provides
recreation rather than preserv-
ing cultural taboos. City Council
should not act as cultural police
and should allow Bongs and
Thongs to stock its shelves the way
Hassan wants them to be filled. It
should be the job of the market,
not City Council, to determine if
Ann Arbor has too many dildos.

LOANS

diminish accessibility to gradu-
ate-level education for students
and worsen the strain of repaying
loans.
In an Aug. 2 statement, the
Student Aid Alliance accused the
federal government of trying to
"balance the budget on the backs
of students," adding that the two
provisions are part of "a clear pat-
tern of an assault on the core stu-
dent aid programs."
"The elimination of the in-
school interest exemption for
graduate and professional stu-
dents and on-time repayment
incentives for student borrow-
ers will result in college becom-
ing more expensive for millions
of students and their families,"
the statement said. "With wide-
spread recognition that our
nation sorely needs to power up
its economic engine, it is more
important than ever to preserve
and provide adequate funding for
the array of federal student aid
programs."

Direct subsidized loans for
graduate students at the Univer-
sity currently carry a borrow-
ing limit of $65,500, with a fixed
interest rate of 6.8 percent for
loans awarded after July 1, 2011,
according to the University's
Office of Financial Aid.
The Office of Financial Aid
offered 3,992 graduate students
Direct Subsidized Loans, totaling
$35.7 million, during the 2009-
2010 academic year. At the time,
University officials said they were
not certain if the rise in costs
would result in lesser rates of
graduate and professional school
matriculation.
Stephen DesJardins, director
of the University's Center for the
Study of Higher and Postsecond-
ary Education, said enrollment is
dependent on a range of factors,
including tuition rates, cost of liv-
ing, the government's credit rating
and federal interest rates.
"You would think that if the
costs of gaining financing rise,
there will be some people who
decide to go to a less expensive
school or some people ... may not
go," DesJardins said. "But people

have different sensitivities to
changes in these prices. It's really
complicated the way it plays out ...
It's not straightforward."
In an e-mail interview on Aug.
5, Pamela Fowler, executive direc-
tor of the University's Office of
Financial Aid, wrote that she was
also unsure if the end to the subsi-
dized loan program would reduce
enrollment.
"We have no way of knowing
if the elimination of the interest
subsidy will have negative impact
on an individual graduate stu-
dent's decision to enroll," Fowler
wrote.
Fowler wrote that ultimately
the decision to attend the Univer-
sity is dependant on a variety of
factors that must be considered
when making a final choice, add-
ing it's important for students and
detractors to look to the more aus-
picious aspects of the debt deal,
like the preservation of the Pell
Grant program
"We did not get everything
we hoped for, but the cuts are not
over and the fight to preserve all
student aid programs continues,"
she wrote.

UMCCC launches new blog

O'DELL
From Page 1
Fitzgerald said. "He lives in Ann
Arbor, and also has the experi-
ence of having worked at another
university, which I think was
important to the University of
Michigan to find someone that
had that experience of working in
a university setting."
Fitzgerald added that in
choosing O'Dell, the University
was impressed that he was known
for having "great integrity and
openness."
Joe Piersante, interim execu-
tive director of DPS, echoed
Fitzgerald, adding that O'Dell -
who worked for the Ann Arbor
Police Department for over 20
years - was chosen for his vast
experience and reputation.
"I think Greg is an excellent
choice," Piersante said. "He's got
a great reputation in law enforce-
ment in Washtenaw County, and
he's had experience as a deputy
chief at the Ann Arbor Police
Department. He's a man of high

everywhere for that specialized
care. Health care of that caliber
requires nurses with specialized
knowledge. When the employer
starts decreasing the benefits
package, it will be harder to
recruit and retain that high cali-
ber of nurses both now and in the
future."
Though the economic down-
turn afflicting Michigan has
forced various unions around
the state to experience pay and
benefit concessions, Sincox said
the nurses union believes that
UMHS has mitigated economic
troubles.
She added that UMHS
doesn't appear to be suffer-
ing from the economy since the
program has continued to profit
over the past 15 years and sev-
eral of their top executives have
recently received salary increas-
es. However, she said UMHS has
undertaken a large financial bur-
den with development of the new
Mott Children's Hospital and

moral integrity.1I think it's a good
choice and I think he'll do well
here at the University of Michi-
gan."
He added he believes O'Dell's
experience working in both Ann
Arbor as well as in a campus set-
ting at Eastern Michigan Univer-
sity will allowhim to deal with the
challenges currently facing Uni-
versity police, such as the recent
assaults against women near cam-
pus.
"I think he's well-suited to
handle the challenge and any
problem that may face him," Pier-
sante said. "When he was the dep-
uty chief at Ann Arbor and I was
the deputy chief at University of
Michigan, we had numerous occa-
sions to lead and collaborate on
crime."
According to the University
press release, O'Dell has resided in
Ann Arbor with his wife for more
than 20 years. He graduated with
a bachelor's degree from Eastern
Michigan University, attended the
University of Toledo College of
Law and graduated from the FBI
National Academy.
that shouldn't be paid for at the
expense of the nurses.
"The only concern UMHS
has expressed recently is how
much the new Mott Children's
Hospital is costing them," Sincox
said. "Their decision to build at a
time that the economy slumped
should not be paid for on the
backs of the nurses."
While UMHS represen-
tatives said they are looking
forward to returning to the
negotiations, the department
declined to comment on specific
points regarding the negotiation.
However, UMHS spokesman
Michael Steigmayer said that
despite the ongoing work toward
a compromise, patients should
not be concerned about the qual-
ity of treatment they will receive
through the system.
"Patients and families can
continue to be confident in the
care they will receive at UMHS
facilities during the negotiation
period," Steigmeyer said. "We
look forward to continued good
negotiations after we return to
the table on August 3 to reach a
mutual agreement."

Site aims to educate
community and help
cancer patients tell
their stories
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Compre-
hensive Cancer Center launched
a cancer weblog on July 26 that
aims to help patients, families and
caretakers by providing informa-
tion, advice and discussion boards
for members to share their experi-
ences.
MCancerTalk.org currently
has about three updates per week
but is expecting to have daily posts
by the fall. The blog accompanies
the Center's Cancer AnswerLine
blog, which is monitored by oncol-
ogy nurses, according to Jennifer
Day, one of the blog's writers and
editors.
"The blog is more of a content
aggregator," Day said. "We're tak-
ing stories and press releases and

content that has been written for
other purposes ... and we take
information we receive from other
organizations that have a similar
mission in educating the public
about cancer."
Day added that the new
blog was inspired by Thrive - a
UMCCC publication intended on
helping those living with cancer
cope with the illness.
Becky Eggleston, manager
of the Cancer Answerline, said
the easy accessibility of Internet
resources like blogs provides those
who live too far to travel to a sup-
port group with the ability to use
information from the UMCCC.
"The goal is to be able to
have patients and family be able
to share their experiences with
one another along with providing
expert advice," Eggleston said.
She added that the blog has
some unique features, including
periodic live web chats with posts
by various medical experts. For
example, she said the blog recently
featured a physician discussing
colorectal cancer, which in turn
spiked the rate of feedback they

received.
"It piqued people's interest
enough so that they would want
to find out about more for them-
selves." Eggleston said.
While the UMCCC's blogis not
the first of its kind on the Internet,
Eggleston said it is more infor-
mal and catered to the patients'
interests in comparison to similar
blogs.
"Ours is more unique because
it's more for patients," Eggleston
said. "Other blogs we've looked at
are more 'institutional'..."
Scott Redding, senior brand
manager for UMHS, pointed out
that the blog is not the only new
resource the UMCCC has imple-
mented, adding they have recently
created a Twitter account and
YouTube channel to expand their
audiences.
"The reason we've added these
other avenues (is) ... we're building
much more content, we're getting
more information out there," said
Redding. "By expanding, we can
start to get our message out there
a little more to different people ...
maybe a different audience."

'The Change-Up' can't vary stale jokes.

By PHILIP CONKLIN
Daily Arts Writer
The first scene of "The Change-
Up" is a good indication of the tenor
of the movie. Dave, played by Jason
Bateman ("The
Switch"), wakes
to the sound of
his crying twin The Change-
babies. While
Dave changes Up
their diapers, At Quality16
these babiesa
wreak havoc and Rave
on their bed- Universal
room, spraying
baby powder
on Dave's face and knocking over
diaper boxes. Then, in the midst
of changing the second twin, Dave
leans over to pick up a diaper and
his baby projectile-poops into his
open mouth.
In a way, it's a kind gesture on
the part of the filmmakers; they're
letting the audience know what's
coming. The film defecates into
the mouth of the audience for two
hours.
"The Change-Up," directed by
David Dobkin ("Fred Claus"), fol-
lows the classic body-switching
comedy formula. Bateman plays an
overachieving lawyer with three
kids and a beautiful wife (Leslie
Mann, "Funny People"), living the

American middle-class dream. Best
friend Mitch, played by Ryan Reyn-
olds ("Green Lantern"), is a playboy
man-child - a mostly unemployed
actor in commercials and soft-core
pornography. After a night of drink-
ing, the two get to talking about
their lives, each expressing envy at
the other's situation. Then, while
peeing into a fountain, the two say
in unison "I wish I had your life,"
magically transporting their souls
into each other's body.
All sorts of high jinks ensue,
the details of which are trivial and
would be even more dull, a seem-
ingly impossible feat, in print than
on the screen. Eventually they each
discover that (spoiler alert!) maybe
their lives aren't so bad after all,

bad Judd Apatow movie.
Even the roles they play have
become cliches for these actors:
Bateman, the earnest, sensible, hap-
less good guy; Reynolds, the hand-

volatile, neglected wife. But to even
call them characters is a misnomer.
These are not individuals with con-
sistent personalities, with whom
we can sympathize, just things to

throw feces at and hear vulgarity

said about this movie, it's that it's
consistent in its tone. Every pathet-
ic attempt at pathos or real feeling

gar, derivative joke and only serves
to further alienate its audience.
How this movie was ever made is
a mystery. We can only assume that
every person involved switched
bodies with a seventh grade boy,
because that is the only explanation
for the immaturity, crudeness and
complete lack of wit or insight evi-
dent in this abhorrent film.

More fun than expected in'30 Minutes or Less'

By DAVID TAO

It's hard to describe "30 Minutes

but lacks the forced "ripped-from-

drama that Life- ***I':

except the bud- and Rave
dies are neitherC .b
cops nor broman- Colambia
tic Judd Apatow
or Will Ferrell-style douchebags.
It's kind of a heist movie, but it's
one of the most comically inept
heists ever put on film. Whatever it
is, the result is a delightful piece of

crowd pleasing fun.
The plot centers around Nick
(Jesse Eisenberg, "The Social Net-
work"), a pizza delivery guy who
stumbles upon Dwayne (Danny
McBride, TV's "Eastbound and
Down") and Travis (Nick Sward-
son, "You Don't Mess with the
Zohan"), a pair of rednecks who're
paying Chango (Michael Pefia,
"The Lincoln Lawyer") to kill
Dwayne's dad so Dwayne can get
his million dollar inheritance.
First, they have to get Chango's
money, so they kidnap Nick, strap
a bomb vest to his chest and give
him 10 hours to get them a hundred
grand, or he explodes into itty bitty
pieces. Nick, in a fit of desperation,
calls his ex-best friend Chet (Aziz
Ansari, TV's "Parks and Recre-
ation") for assistance, and they're

off to rob a bank and avoid a fiery
end.
After earning an Oscar nomi-
nation for "The Social Network,"
Eisenberg goes back to his dorky
roots as the awkward man-boy, this
time tempered with some campy,
comical fear - fear of exploding,
fear of cops, fear of prison. It's
Ansari, however, who steals the
show with his hilariously frantic,
nasally expressions of shock, his
ridiculous suggestions delivered
in perfect deadpan and his excep-
tional comedic timing. News that
Nick had sex with his twin sister
is received with comic outrage. He
consults the bomb-making experts
at Wikipedia in an attempt to
defuse the bomb and, when all else
fails, suggests that Nick cut off his
arms and wiggle out. And his little

ditionally, it's a
tale of irony and
self-destruction,
with a lot of darkness and despair
brewing beneath the surface. But
in its latest attempt at a franchise
reboot, Fox turns this premise on
its head, releasing a heavy-hand-
ed, 105-minute PETA commercial
in which the schoolyard bully -
humanity - gets what it deserves.
Our hippy liberal tale of cli-
ched revelry begins in the big wild

from the faceless drug conglom-

the humans are evil. Researcher

Less cool are Steven Jacobs (David
Oyelowo, TV's "MI-5"), the head
of giant conglomerate, who (gasp!)
wants his investment to turn a
profit, and animal "trainer" Dodge
Landon (Tom Felton, "Harry Pot-
ter and the Deathly Hallows: Part
2"), who (less sarcastic gasp!) tor-
tures captive apes for his sadistic
pleasure.
From there, we get a fairly rote,
predictable story in the same vein
as the original all-the-humans-
die premise, with a few preachy
tropes in between about how some
things aren't meant to be changed.
Meanwhile, the entire cast does its
best to deliberately shred audience
sympathy. Felton is particularly
hateable, giving the same, bratty,
immature performance we've seen
him give eight times as Draco Mal-
foy. Franco, who is supposedly the
human center of the film, gives a
flat, indifferent performance, less
Oscar-nominee and more stoned
Oscar host.
The apes are what save the
movie, making up for the emo-
tional dead weight of the human
characters. Caesar, Rodman's pri-
mary test subject, is a marvel of
modern effects technology. He's
played by motion-capture veteran
Andy Serkis, who brought King
Kong to life in Peter Jackson's
2005 remake and voiced Gollum
in Jackson's "Lord of the Rings"
trilogy, and for all intents and
purposes, looks like a real captive

ape. But he's also more than that.
Despite his simian origins, he's
the most humanized character in
the entire cast. His struggle for
freedom is a visceral tale, told effi-
ciently through actions and with
a minimum of cheesy talking-ani-
mal dialogue. We bond with Cae-
sar. We cringe as he's tortured in
captivity, we smile as he develops
a paternal relationship with Rod-
man and we cheer when he inevi-
tably succeeds.
In his niche,
Felton bullies
apes now, not
boy wizards.
But therein also lies the film's
greatest weakness. As the climax
approaches and an assembled
primate army faces off against
heavily-armed SWAT teams, we
realize that we've been cheering
on the extinction of the human
race, which the story treats as just
vengeance for researchers who
are callously trying to save lives.
The best propaganda is restrained
- we adapt the director's point
of view without consciously real-
izing it's the director's point of
view. And as chimps scream and
helicopters explode, it becomes
obvious that the film is anything
but subtle.

("Momma's
Man") and the
team behind "Blue Valentine"
and "Half Nelson," the film, at
times painfully awkward but
reigning in deep hues of candor,
triumphs in its composition and
characters' execution.
The sound of trickling water
adapts into an image of an over-
weight teenager submerged in a
bathtub, face deadpan with apa-
thy. We soon find out that this is
title character, Terri Thompson
(Jacob Wysocki, TV's "Huge"),
who lives with and takes care of
his mentally ill but sarcastic and
insightful Uncle James (Creed
Bratton, TV's "The Office").
As the film gently progresses
from the opening scene to Terri
arriving at high school home-
room tardy, derogatorily whis-
tled at by his classmates, classical
soprano female vocals pervade
our auditory senses setting an
offbeat mood for "TERRI," a hit
at this year's Sundance Film Fes-
tival.
Female intrigue sparks up the
energy of the cinematic space
when we see Terri peering
through flour and baking soda in
Home Economics, eyes unblink-
ing as he watches Heather Miles
(Olivia Crocicchia, TV's "Rescue
Me") push her boyfriend's hands
away from underneath the table.
An instant dislike for the guy who
has previously verbally harassed
Terri, develops as he says, "It's
the perfect moment." Heather
says, "No." He whispers aggres-
sively, "Yes." A lesson on sexual
consent? Almost feels that way.
Fifteen minutes in, the movie
begins. John C. Reilly ("Magno-
lia") enters the picture as Prin-
cipal Fitzgerald, who calls Terri

in to discuss the boy's worri-
some "red flags": grade drops,
no class participation and paja-
mas as public attire. The film's
base is established when "Fitzer"
explains why he asked Terri to
meet - "Every year there are two
groups of kids that stand out here
... there's the good-hearted kids
and there's the bad-hearted kids."
The rest of the story is a sort
of indirect response to Terri's
response to his principle's state-
ment, "And which one am I?"
The audience undergoes a sym-
pathetic experience as Terri sets
mice traps, spells cheddar incor-
rectly on the grocery list, shaves
Uncle James' face and gets kicked
out of gym because he wouldn't
participate in high jump.
Like 'Charlie
Bartlett,' but
with more
pajamas.-
The pace of the film picks up
speed about halfway through
when Terri sticks up for Heath-
er as she becomes somewhat of
a social outcast because of an
embarrassing act. Not only dres
he win Heather's friendship
and admiration when he diverts
negative attention from her in
school by doing a comedic Joe
Hollywood gimmick, but also
befriends a perverted but lovable
kid, Chad (newcomer Bridger
Zadina), who also meets with Mr.
Fitzgerald on a weekly basis.
Heather invites herself over
to Terri's to meet his uncle, and
when Chad impels the trajec-
tory of the evening, the plot hits a
startling but sincere tone of edgi-
ness.
The movie ends on a pleas-
ant note of Fitzgerald and Terri
shooting hoops, eating cheese-
burgers and talking about the
intimate folds of life. Supported
by eloquent filming, "TERRI"
subtly succeeds as a unique
portrayal of the ugly and the
beautiful, of every human being
wanting to fit in and feel wanted.

Woolfolk, Floyd return to anchor 'M' secondary

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
DailySportsEditor
Troy Woolfolk didn't mince
words - it was painful to watch the
Michigan football team last season.
Woolfolk was supposed to be an
integral piece on defense, locking
down the No. 1 cornerback slot. But
that was before a foot injury dur-
ing fall camp sidelined him for the
entire 2010 season.
"The hardest part is just look-
ing at the games and seeing how I
would be able to impact the team,
make them that much better,"
Woolfolk said last November. "I see
our defense struggling. I feel like it's
kind of my fault because of my inju-
ry, and I can't help them out."
Michigan's secondary was in
shambles. Opposing quarterbacks
launched an aerial raid on the sec-
ondary, and did it with ease, to the
tune of 261.8 passing yards per
game. To make matters worse,then-
redshirt sophomore cornerback J.T.
#Floyd - Woolfolk's replacement at
No. 1 cornerback - suffered a sea-
son-ending ankle injury prior to the
Wolverines' mid-season clash with
Illinois. It was a recipe for disaster.
But with the new Brady Hoke
regime comes (another) second
4chance for the woebegone second-

time on the field this season.
Seeing the bulk of the time at
safety will be the duo of sophomore
Carvin Johnson and redshirt junior
Jordan Kovacs. Take note: Kovacs
finished second on the Wolverines
with 75 tackles in 2009 and skyrock-
eted his production with 116 tackles
last year.
But a safety nearly leading the
team in tackles two years running
means the ball is reaching the sec-
ondary far too often - and that
spells doom for a defense.
Johnson emerged as a leader
on the back line during the sec-
ond half of last season. During the
Spring Game in April, he picked off
two passes - although credit there
might go more to quarterback Devin
Gardner than Johnson.
While Michigan recorded just 12
interceptions last season, return-
ing a more experienced cast should
boost those numbers. And Johnson,
a self-proclaimed ball hawk, could
lead that charge.
"I love making interceptions,"
Johnson said after the Spring Game.
"I don't like to make the big hit ... I
like us to have the ball"
He can leave the heavy hitting
to sophomore safety Marvin Rob-
inson, who had some jarring hits in
spring camp that sent a message to

the team. At Big Ten Media Days,
senior defensive tackle Mike Martin
said Robinson's hits set the tempo
for the defense's new mentality.
Unlike last season, there is some
added depth in the secondary.
Despite losing Ray Vinopal and
James Rogers - both productive
members of the defense - players
like fifth-year senior Tony Anderson
and sophomores Courtney Avery,
Terrence Talbott and Thomas Gor-
don can learn from their increased
playing time with Michigan's
depleted corps in 2010.
A few freshmen have a chance to
come in and make an instant impact,
but barring injury, Hoke will likely
elect to redshirt several newcomers.
Countess, Greg Brown and Delonte
Hollowell have the best chance at
seeing the field in their first season.
Michigan's cast is still raw and
largely unproven, but the top four
on the secondary's depth chart are
household names surrounding the
football program.
We call that progress.
Preseason grade: C+
Projected starters: J.T. Floyd,
Troy Woolfolk, Jordan Kovacs and

ary. Michigan's success has - and
always will - depend on its defense.
And that starts with the secondary.
Woolfolk is back as a fifth-year
senior, but after missing an entire
season, he'll need a few games to
adjust to the game speed. Unfor-
tunately, Notre Dame's All-Amer-
ican wide receiver Michael Floyd
has been reinstated after a drunk
driving charge and will be staring
Woolfolk down in the second game
of the season. There will be no rest
for Troy. But junior quarterback

Denard Robinson thinks that if the
summer workouts are any indica-
tion, Woolfolk won't miss a beat.
"It's hard to go deep on Troy
these days," Robinson said at Big
Ten Media Days last Friday. "I
tried to throw a couple deep, but he
always seems to catch up to them."
Floyd will also return to anchor

his potential in the spring.
As a former skill-position guy,
Gordon has the mobility to drop
into coverage and could give Mat-
tison the versatility that he is
rarely afforded at the linebacker
spot. Even Rodriguez noticed that
Gordon was more effective when
he was closer to the line of scrim-
mage, opting to move him from
safety to the hybrid "spur" position
midway through last season.
The only questions are how big
did Gordon get over the summer,
which we'll discover soon enough,
and how physical can he be?
Demens may have enough physi-
cality in himself for the other two
linebackers, but Gordon may have
to mix it up with huge Big Ten line-
men and may get pushed around a
bit. That's a hard lesson Rodriguez
learned when he ran the 3-3-5,
and that's why the alumni are so
supportive of Brady Hoke and his

emphasis on physical play. Can
Cam Gordon make his third posi-
tion change in three years? Can he
do it mentally? We'll find out.
The third and final starter is the
prodigal Marell Evans. Once a line-
backer under Lloyd Carr, Evans
transferred after his sophomore
year in 2008, Carr's final season,
only to return once Rodriguez had
left. Now a fifth-year senior, Evans
was the penciled in starter during
the Spring Game.
He may have some young, ath-
letic linebackers nipping at his
heels, though. Jake Ryan really
impressed the coaches with his
relentless motor and athleticism
getting to the quarterback and
dropping into coverage. Senior
tight end Kevin Koger said at Big
Ten Media Days in Chicago that
Ryan had added weight to his listed
6-foot-3, 224-pound frame.
After he starred in the Spring
Game, picking off a pass for a
touchdown, that was one of the
only knocks on Ryan: he needed

to add weight and, of course, the
redshirt freshman wasn't experi-
enced. If the stories are true, he'll
run through a brick wall to get that
experience. Senior J.B. Fitzgerald,
who has primarily been a spe-
cial teams player throughout his
career, and redshirt sophomore
Mike Jones, as well as fifth-year
senior Brandon Herron were also
in the mix. Jones is smaller than
the other two, as he was converted
from safety to linebacker.
But none of the two projected
starters at outside linebacker have
enough of a vice grip on their posi-
tions to ward off highly ranked
incoming freshmen, Antonio Poole
or Frank Clark. These spots will be
fought for in camp. The constant
will be Demens roaming the mid-
dle. I know what you're thinking:
at least Ezeh is gone.
Preseason grade: C+
Projected starters: Cam Gor-
don, Kenny Demens, Marell Evans

The Michigan football team's
special teams unit was anything but
special last season. The punt return
and kick return teams were average
at best. And the kicking team was
downrightbrutal.
Once Michigan crossed the
midfield stripe, at times I hoped
then-redshirt freshman kicker Seth
Broekhuizen would just run on the
field, close his eyes, and swing his
leg as hard as he could. Orthatthen-
redshirt freshman Brendan Gib-
bons would carry his golf bag onto
the field, pull out a pitching wedge
and give the balla whack.
Well, golf clubs, of course, would
be illegal. But at least it'd give the
Wolverines a valid excuse for fin-
ishing dead last in the nation with
four field goals made all season.
Ifthatstatistic alone isn't enough
to make you want to bang your
head against a wall, consider this:
Broekhuizen's season total of three
made field goals (Gibbons was 1-for-
5) equals the game total of field
goals made bythen-Ohio State kick-
er Devin Barclay in the Buckeyes'
37-7 win over the Wolverines last
November.
At this rate, the two Michigan
kickers will need about five years to
equal Barclay's one-year total of 19
kicks made.
But there is good news regarding
the kicking game - the Wolverines
can go nowhere but up. And they
will. When new Michigan coach
Brady Hoke left San Diego State for
Michigan, Matt Wile, an All-Amer-
ican kicker who had committed to
San Diego State, followed him.
Rivals.com listed Wile as the
No. 4 kicker in the nation, and he
finished his senior year at Francis
Parker High School 10-for-13 with a
career-long boot of 49 yards.
Wile won't necessarily be the
kicking team's savior - there's no
saying that he'll even be the starter,
as Hoke has given no indication
who will send the ball flying come
Sept. 3 - but Wile gives Wolverine
fans hope, something they haven't
had in the kicking game in over a
year. And with new special teams
coach Dan Ferrigno with the reins
this year, there's no telling what
Broekhuizen and Gibbons might be
able to do if they can forget about
last year's nightmare.
Keep in mind that Gibbons, like
Wile, was an All-American in high
school. His list of high-school acco-
