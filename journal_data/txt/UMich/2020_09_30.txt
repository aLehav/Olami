Movie 
theaters 
and 

performance venues can reopen 
Oct. 9 in accordance with 
public health guidelines, Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced 
in 
a 
Friday 
press 
release. 

Whitmer also altered limits on 
indoor and outdoor gatherings, 
putting a formula in place to 
determine capacity at different 
locations.

In a statement, Whitmer said 

the state’s early steps to combat 
the virus made it possible to 
loosen restrictions.

“Michigan took some of the 

most aggressive action against 
COVID-19 in the country, and 
as a result, the health of our 
families and our economy are 
faring better than our neighbors 
in 
other 
states,” 
Whitmer 

said. “As a result, we are now 
able to reopen movie theaters 
and performance venues with 
strict safety measures in place. 
I know these business owners 
have made incredible sacrifices 

during this crisis to protect our 
families and frontline workers, 
and my administration will 
continue working to help them 
get back on their feet.”

Whitmer signed an executive 

order to amend the MI Safe 
Start Plan to allow for the 
reopening. 
Whitmer 
also 

adjusted the limits on indoor 
and outdoor gatherings. Under 
the new rules, rather than 
being limited to 10 people, non-
residential indoor events now 
must limit attendance to 20 
people per 1,000 square feet or 

20% of fixed seating capacity. 
The size of any indoor event, 
no matter how large the venue, 
must not exceed 500 people. 
Face masks are required at 
these gatherings.

For outdoor events, instead of 

the previous limit of 100 people, 
attendance will be capped at 30 
people per 1,000 square feet or 
30% of fixed seating capacity, 
with the size of the gathering 
restricted to 1,000 people. 

During sophomore Eve Taylor’s 

orientation for the University of 
Michigan’s Ross School of Business, 
white students called her hair 
“unprofessional” for the workplace. 
Taylor, who is Black, said the white 
student with straight hair called 
her own hair more adequate. 

Taylor was shocked – she had 

spent a lot of time getting ready for 
the orientation session. 

Over the past several months, 

Black 
Business 
students 
have 

spoken to The Michigan Daily 
about a lack of transparency among 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
efforts at the Business School. Black 
students are underrepresented in 
Ross, as well as the University as a 
whole. 

Complaints 
about 
diversity 

at the University and Ross in 
particular are not new. Previously, 
some Business students have said 
the lack of a race and ethnicity 
course requirement in Ross played 
a role in the Business School’s 
status as a predominately white 
institution. 

Business 
School 
Dean 

Scott DeRue said the Business 

administration 
recognizes 
the 

improvements it must make in 
regard to DEI, and it is working 
hard to achieve those goals.

“In no way do we claim that we 

are perfect or that we have solved 
all of these challenges and issues,” 
DeRue said. “But we are deeply 
committed and unwavering in 
our commitment to enhancing 
diversity on campus.” 

Microaggressions 
at 
the 

Business School

Created in June, the Instagram 

account @blackatmichigan has 
been a space for Black students, 
alumni, faculty and staff to share 
their experiences with race and 
racism on campus — anonymously 
or not — while at the University, 
according to the account. Similar 
accounts seeking to bring to light 
discriminatory 
behaviors 
have 

appeared at other universities.

While many of the respondents 

did not share which college they 
were in at the University in the early 
posts on the account, out of those 
who did, the Business School was 
a recurring subject. Out of the first 
25 posts on the Instagram page, 
nine of them shared Black students’ 
negative racial experiences within 
the Business School. 

Ypsilanti 
resident 
Audrey 

Anderson’s voice carried across 
the University of Michigan Diag 
Saturday, echoed by about 100 people 
at a protest against racial injustice 
organized by the nonprofit Survivors 

Speak. 

“Ain’t gonna let nobody turn me 

around,” Anderson sang. “I’m gonna 
keep on marching, keep on standing, 
keep on ‘til justice comes.” 

She told the crowd she’d first heard 

the song as a little girl when Martin 
Luther King Jr. led the freedom 
riders through the Jim Crow South 
in the 1960s. Anderson noted the 

recurring nature of police brutality, 
comparing the brutality freedom 
riders were met with decades earlier 
to the violence protesters faced 
across the country this past summer.

“I never thought I would be seeing 

this again, and again and again,” 
Anderson said. 

Saturday’s “Where Do We Go 

From Here?” protest came in the 

wake of the “wanton endangerment” 
charge filed against the police 
officers who shot Breonna Taylor and 
Michigan Attorney General Dana 
Nessel’s finding that a Washtenaw 
County Sheriff deputy’s use of force 
against Sha’Teina Grady El was 
justified.

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Experts have emphasized 

the need for widespread testing 
and contact tracing in order 
to safely reopen universities. 
But some at the University 
of Michigan are concerned 
about whether contact tracing 
on campus and surveillance 
testing efforts will be able to 
stem outbreaks before they 
occur.

Angela Beck, associate dean 

in the School of Public Health 
and faculty adviser of Contact 
Tracing Corps, worked with 
the University over the summer 
to develop a program for 
contact tracing on campus. The 
CTC is composed of volunteers 
who reach out to students who 
test positive for the virus and 
notify their close contacts of 
the 
University’s 
quarantine 

protocol. Contact tracing is 
vital to preventing the virus 
from causing an outbreak on 
campus, Beck said. 

“I 
think 
this 
program 

is 
really 
helpful 
to 
the 

University’s 
containment 

response for COVID-19,” Beck 
said. “Key to keeping the virus 
contained and keeping our 
campus as safe as possible is 
to identify who is a positive 
case and who’s been exposed 

to a positive case as quickly 
as they can and isolate them 
from the rest of the population 
so that we can really stop that 
transmission.”

The 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health 
Department 
has 

an 
agreement 
with 
the 

University’s 
Environment, 

Health & Safety Department to 
conduct contact tracing under 
the jurisdiction of Washtenaw 
County, a responsibility the 
health department “deputizes” 
the 
University 
volunteers 

to undertake, according to 
Communications and Health 
Promotions 
Administrator 

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia. 

Danielle 
Sheen, 
executive 

director 
of 
EHS 
said 
the 

department is responsible for 
“case investigation and contact 
tracing” as part of their legal 
agreement with WCHD. 

CTC 
volunteers, 
ranging 

from 
graduate 
students 
to 

Public Health undergraduates, 
undergo training modules to 
learn how to best work with 
the patients. Beck said the 
partnership between EHS and 
the WCHD has been beneficial 
in working with volunteers.

“That 
legal 
agreement 

between EHS and Washtenaw 
County is partly what makes 
this possible,” Beck said.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer aims 

to make Michigan completely 
carbon neutral by the year 
2050, her office announced in 
a press release Wednesday.

“The science is clear – 

climate 
change 
is 
directly 

impacting our public health, 
environment, our economy and 
our families,” Whitmer said in 
a statement. “This dangerous 
reality 
is 
already 
causing 

harm throughout Michigan, 
with communities of color 
and low-income Michiganders 
suffering 
disproportionately, 

which 
is 
why 
I’m 
taking 

immediate action to protect 
our state. We owe it to our 
children and grandchildren to 
leave them a cleaner, safer and 
healthier world.”

According 
to 
Whitmer, 

the steps outlined in both 
Executive Directive 2020-10 
and Executive Order 2020-
182 — both of which she signed 
this morning — will provide 
protections 
for 
Michigan’s 

environment, 
economy 
and 

public health. She wrote the 
new MI Healthy Climate Plan 
will also position Michigan to 
attract clean energy jobs.

The Council on Climate 

Solutions will take steps that 
address diversity and equity 
while working closely with the 
Department of Environment, 
Great Lakes and Energy. The 
Council and EGLE will be 
working together on emission-

reduction strategies to reduce 
the greenhouse gas produced 
in Michigan by 28%. This 
will be lower than the levels 
present in Michigan in the 
1990s.

In 
a 
statement, 
EGLE 

Director Liesl Clark wrote the 
executive order will protect 
the environment in Michigan 
for future generations.

“Michiganders 
have 

been on the front lines of 
environmental protection from 
the first Earth Day 50 years 
ago, and we continue to lead 
with these important steps to 
safeguard Michiganders and 
their natural resources,” Clark 
wrote.

Clark said the project will 

link together plans from cities 
and towns all over the state that 
have been implemented to help 
battle climate emergencies at 
the local level.

“We’re excited to amplify 

and elevate the work of so 
many 
Michigan 
cities 
and 

towns taking vital steps to 
protect their residents and 
resources, while sharing in 
the benefits brought by clean 
energy 
industries,” 
Clark 

wrote.

Public Policy senior Sabrina 

Butcher, 
Citizens 
Climate 

Lobby co-president, said she 
is pleased with the new orders 
from Whitmer.

“I think it’s really cool that 

part of their goal is to address 
environmental 
justice,” 

Butcher said. “Michigan has 
a lot of wind energy potential 

especially in the zone to be 
really cool to see renewable 
energy 
kind 
of 
take 
over 

Michigan 
and 
Michigan’s 

economy and to kind of come 
back that way.”

Citizens who represent a 

range of sectors, experiences 
and 
expertise 
relating 
to 

achieving carbon neutrality 
will be able to apply to be 
on the Council on Climate 
Solutions. Butcher expressed 
concerns with the open-ended 
call to the public to apply to be 
on the council.

“Bringing a lot of different 

voices together is cool, but I 
think that’s kind of a dangerous 
game because if we look at 
something like the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality, we’ve had it for a 
couple years now and it’s done 
absolutely nothing,” Butcher 
said. 
“I 
think 
sometimes 

commissions like that can be 
a little more symbolic instead 
producing 
actual 
strategies 

that get adopted.”

The City of Ann Arbor has 

plans of its own to go completely 
carbon neutral by 2030. The 
plan addresses the sectors 
of energy, mobility, resource 
reduction 
and 
adaptation 

and 
resilience, 
aiming 
to 

transition to renewable energy 
sources and design a zero-
carbon transportation system 
throughout the city.

Ypsilanti 
is 
following 

Ann Arbor’s lead, drafting a 
similar plan to achieve carbon 
neutrality by the year 2035. 

Despite 
challenges 
posed 

by 
the 
COVID-19 
crisis 

and concerns about budget 
shortfalls, 
Ann 
Arbor 
is 

pushing ahead with its billion-
dollar initiative.

Ann Arbor’s plan will rely 

on efforts at the University 
of Michigan to reduce the 
school’s carbon footprint. The 
President’s 
Commission 
on 

Carbon Neutrality is reviewing 
options for reaching carbon 
neutrality, but a timeline for 
a carbon neutrality initiative 
has not yet been set. The 
commission 
released 
its 

second interim report in June 
and is now beginning work on 
later phases of research and 
analysis.

In a press release, U.S. Rep. 

Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., 

wrote 
she 
supported 

Whitmer’s plan, noting more 
work must be done at all levels 
of government to transition to 
a net-zero emissions economy.

“Thanks 
to 
Governor 

Whitmer’s 
leadership, 

Michigan takes seriously the 
effects of climate change on 
public health, environmental 
justice 
and 
an 
equitable 

transition to a more sustainable 
economy for our communities 
and workers,” Dingell wrote. 
“Michigan and the United 
States will stay at the forefront 
of innovation and technology 
and leave a healthy planet for 
generations to come.”

Gov. Whitmer announces plan to

Executive orders aim to reduce carbon footprint to zero by 2050 while

Governor Gretchen Whitmer announces her plan to make Michigan carbon-neutral by 2050 on Wednesday afternoon (Note: This photograph was 
taken in January 2020).

WMG-contact@umich.edu 

“Not every university has 
this type of legal agreement 
with the county, so I think 
we’re able to help in a way, 
and provide some students 
learning 
experiences 
in 

a way that I think other 
universities probably can’t. 
So that’s also a reason why 
moving in this direction 
seems like a possibility.”

Business freshman Audrey 

Thedford learned she came 
into contact with someone 
who had tested positive for 
COVID-19 after receiving a 
call from a contact tracer. 
She said she was confused 
about why she was sent to 
quarantine 
housing 
and 

wished her contact tracer had 
given her more information.

“My contact tracer was 

really nice, but when he first 
contacted me, I was freaked 
out,” Thedford said. “I wish 

they could have told me who 
I came in contact with … 
I emailed (CTC) about my 
concerns and at one point, he 
just stopped responding to 
me about that specific issue 
but responded to me about 
another issue, so I just kinda 
felt swept under the rug.”

LSA 
senior 
Libby 
Kirk 

learned she had interacted 
with someone who tested 
positive for COVID-19 after 
the person reached out to 
her directly. A day later, CTC 
called her. She quarantined 
last week.

Though the contact tracing 

program was helpful in her 
situation, Kirk said it was 
also imperative for the person 
who tested positive to inform 
her so she could get tested 
right away. 

“In general, I think what 

has been more helpful is the 
person who tested positive 
contacting us right away,” 
Kirk said. “Because if I did 
have it, I wouldn’t have 

known for a whole day until 
they contact traced me, so 
I think the most helpful 
thing has been the person 
contacting me themselves.”

Kirk 
also 
said 
one 
of 

the 
program’s 
flaws 
is 

that it relies on student 
accountability.

“I think in some ways it is 

(working),” Kirk said. “But 
in other ways, it’s relying on 
students to be accountable for 
their actions, which I don’t 
think we can really count on 
everybody for that.” 

Public 
Health 
professor 

Emily Martin, who runs the 
COVID-19 
sampling 
and 

tracking 
program, 
spoke 

at the University Board of 
Regents meeting Thursday 
afternoon and shared data 
from the first wave of results. 
Martin told The Michigan 
Daily how multiple negative 
tests could change within 
14 days and, if students are 
ordered to quarantine, they 
must do it for the full two 

weeks.

“You can give me 100 

negative tests while you’re in 
quarantine and you still have 
to stay in quarantine because 
you could turn positive at 
any point during that time 
frame,” Martin said. “So, 
unfortunately, 
there 
have 

been some people who have 
suggested that, ‘What if we 
use tests earlier in quarantine 
to try to release people?’ It 
doesn’t (work like that) … 
I think that this is still the 
safest way to do that process.”

Thedford 
said 
she 
is 

currently 
quarantined 
at 

her 
permanent 
residence 

after spending a week at 
Northwood 
apartments. 

Thedford 
said 
she 
was 

concerned 
about 
getting 

the 
virus 
from 
residents 

who 
tested 
positive 
after 

encountering these students 
outside of her quarantine 
room.

In May, protests erupted in 

Ypsilanti after a video showed 
the officer repeatedly hitting 
Grady El in the head.

Elected officials, candidates 

and community members spoke 
out against racial injustice in 
education, the criminal justice 
system and the economy during 
Saturday’s event. 

Eli 
Savit, 
Democratic 

candidate for Washtenaw County 
prosecutor, said the charge for 
wanton endangerment — but not 
for Taylor’s murder — proved that 
“Black lives are devalued.”

Bill 
Amadeo, 
Grady 
El’s 

attorney, told the crowd he is 
committed to fighting Nessel’s 
decision in the Grady El case. 
He said he is also representing 
many young Black men who 
are overcharged in Washtenaw 
County.

“They have been victims of the 

criminal justice system,” Amadeo 
said. “If we’re going to move 
forward, this bullshit needs to 
stop, and it’s only going to stop if 
we all sit down and talk as a team.”

A recent report from the 

Citizens for Racial Equality in 
Washtenaw 
found 
significant 

gaps in the treatment of different 
racial groups in the county’s 
criminal 
justice 
system. 
The 

report 
revealed 
prosecutors 

charge people of color more often 

than they do white people.

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 

D-Mich., told The Michigan Daily 
before the event on Saturday that 
she was one of the people who 
suggested the Grady El case go to 
Nessel’s office.

“We need to have someone 

who’s going to look at what facts 
are,” Dingell said. “Sometimes 
they’re really difficult findings 
that are made. We’ve got to figure 
out how we’re going to go forward 
from here and have a legal process 
that’s fair, open and transparent 
(and) treats everyone the same 
way, and also talk about the 
problems we still have.”

Dingell told the crowd she was 

frustrated by the lack of progress 
on racial issues in the U.S., a 

failing exposed this summer amid 
a series of high-profile police 
killings. She criticized President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
leadership 

during the unrest.

“We have a problem of injustice 

in America,” Dingell said. “But 
what we need is a leader who’s 
not afraid to have uncomfortable 
conversations, not a leader who’s 
gonna put kerosene on a fire and 
divide this country with fear and 
hatred.” 

Rev. 
Joe 
Summers, 
pastor 

at the Episcopal Church of the 
Incarnation, pointed to the general 
wealth of University students, 
many of whom he said come from 
households making hundreds of 
thousands of dollars per year, as 
evidence of the disparities in the 

community. He said the nation’s 
education 
system 
gives 
the 

wealthiest families access to high 
schools that send students to elite 
universities. Meanwhile, college-
aged Black men are more likely to 
go to prison than graduate college 
in Michigan, he said.

“And it costs almost as much to 

send someone to prison as it costs 
to send them to a place like the 
University of Michigan,” Summers 
said.

Art & Design sophomore Emma 

Peterson said she came to protest 
the lack of indictment in the Taylor 
case. She said she was inspired by 
Summers’s call to action.

“Since we’re privileged enough 

to have the opportunities that this 
university gives us, our obligation 

is to give back to our communities,” 
Peterson said. 

Other speakers included Nick 

Roumel, candidate for Washtenaw 
County Circuit Court Judge, and 
Krystal DuPree, candidate for Ann 
Arbor Public School board.

After the speeches, the crowd 

filed out of the Diag to chant and 
march through downtown Ann 
Arbor. 

Aside 
from 
some 
of 
the 

organizers, the protesters were 
almost all white. For Michigan 
State 
University 
sophomore 

Savannah Fort, the racial makeup 
was nothing new.

In Ann Arbor, two iconic 

local cinemas — the State 
Theatre on South State Street 
and the Michigan Theater on 
East Liberty Street — have 
been closed since the start 
of the pandemic. Both have 
offered virtual screenings of 
films and asked for donations 
to help keep them in business.

The city currently limits 

indoor 
gatherings 
to 
10 

individuals and caps events at 
25 people when in an outdoor 
setting. City Council passed 
an 
ordinance 
in 
August 

putting the restrictions in 
place amid fears that students 
returning to the University 
of Michigan’s campus could 
trigger an outbreak. 

Those 
restrictions 
align 

with rules set by Washtenaw 
County earlier in August. 
The county’s policy prohibits 
outdoor gatherings of more 
than 25 people in Ann Arbor 
and Ypsilanti, both of which 
are college towns.

As of Friday, the University’s 

COVID-19 dashboard, which 
was 
recently 
updated 
to 

include testing at off-campus 
facilities and better align 
with data from the county, 
showed a total positive case 
count of 288 since Aug. 30, 
the day before the start of 
the fall semester. That count 
includes both students and 
non-students.

On Wednesday, prior to 

the University’s decision to 
incorporate off-campus tests 
that were not self-reported, 
the dashboard reported 117 
positive 
cases 
during 
the 

same time period.

Whitmer noted the state is 

still in a state of emergency 
and that the virus is still a 
persistent threat. 

“We are not out of the woods 

yet, and we will continue 
to monitor the effects of 
these incremental changes,” 
Whitmer said. “Right now, the 
federal government and all 50 
states have been under some 
form of state of emergency. 
We must stay the course and 
continue fighting this virus 
on behalf of our families, 
frontline workers, and our 
small businesses.”

THEATERS
From Page 1

Business 
graduate 
student 

Tunde Osilaja, who is of Nigerian 
and American descent, wrote in 
a post on @blackatmichigan that 
his professor made a derogatory 
remark about Nigerian people to 
his 80-person section in September 
2018. 

According to Osilaja’s post, the 

professor said, “I wouldn’t try 
to deceive you, I’m not like one 
of those Nigerians,” a comment 
that refers to a discriminatory 
stereotype about Nigerians. 

“I thought I misunderstood 

him, but I was shocked when he 
repeated the same comment later 
in the lesson,” Osilaja said.

DeRue told The Daily the 

Business administration is aware 
of this comment and has addressed 
it with the faculty member. 

“I’m aware of the matter, and 

certainly it’s unfortunate and 
disappointing, very disappointing 
that happened,” DeRue said. 

When asked by The Daily what 

specifically was said to the faculty 
member regarding the incident, a 
spokesperson for DeRue said they 
cannot comment on personnel 
matters.

The professor’s comments are 

not what hurt Osilaja the most, 
he said, but rather the response 
of 
his 
classmates. 
According 

to Osilaja, the majority of his 
classmates laughed along with 
the professor, while only a few 
of them approached him later to 
discuss the incident and share their 
misgivings.

DeRue said the administration 

encourages students and faculty to 
report any discrimination they may 
experience. 

“We take these matters very 

seriously and are very proactive 
... and we do a follow-up on every 
single instance that is reported and 
take action as appropriate for that 
matter,” DeRue said.

Many Black Business students 

said 
their 
experiences 
with 

discrimination and racism were 
covert rather than overt, such as 
microaggressions — remarks or 
actions that communicate negative 
or demeaning attitudes toward 
marginalized groups.

Business junior Karla Bell, Black 

Business Undergraduate Society 
president, said she has experienced 
microaggressions when working 
in small groups in class where a 
majority of the other students were 
white.

“There have been experiences, 

especially working within teams, 
where I would say something 
and then I’m not heard, and then 
someone will say a similar thing 
and then they’ll be listened to,” 
Bell said. “A lot of times, it’s the 
lack of people believing that you 
have the skills that you obviously 
have because we’re all in the same 
place.”

An underrepresented Black 

community

In the Winter 2020 semester, 3.3 

percent of students in the Business 
School were Black and 50.7 percent 
of students were white, according 
to the Office of the Registrar. 

Business 
alum 
Errington 

Bethel said the Business School’s 
racial demographics should be 
proportionate to the country’s. 
About 14 percent of people in 
Michigan and 13.4 percent of 
people in the U.S. are Black.

“Michigan needs to look at Black 

Americans getting accepted into 
Ross and understand either why 
they’re not getting in, understand 
why 
they’re 
choosing 
to 
go 

elsewhere, and it’s always a play 
on, ‘Is it the chicken or the egg?’” 
Bethel said. “So, do we get more 
Black students, and then we need 
more Black professors, or do we 
get more Black professors and then 
more Black students come in?”

Business 
Professor 
Marcus 

Collins said there are not enough 
students 
of 
color 
attending 

the 
Business 
School 
or 
the 

University. 
However, 
he 
said 

these demographics are a result 
of a systemic issue larger than the 
University.

“I think as higher education 

becomes more financially out of 
reach for socially and economically 
deprived 
communities, 

marginalized communities, you’re 
going to see lack of representation,” 
Collins said. “It’s a major issue, and 
I think that it doesn’t fall at any one 
school’s feet.” 

DeRue said one reason behind 

the low number of students of color 
at the Business school is Proposal 2, 
which was approved by Michigan 
voters in 2006 and prohibits 
colleges in Michigan from taking 
race into account in the admissions 
process. 

But it is not clear if the 

demographics within the Business 
School have changed since the 
proposal. In the winter semester 
of 2005, prior to the approval 
of the proposal, Black students 
comprised 3.8 percent of Business 
students, nearly the same as the 
3.3 percent of Black students in the 
Business school today. 

DeRue said the Business School 

has been working hard to increase 
diversity 
within 
the 
student 

body. Programs like Michigan 
Ross Enriching Academics in 
Collaboration with High Schools 
(MReach) 
help 
high 
school 

students who are interested in 
business prepare for the college 
applications process and explore 
the business world. 

And 
this 
summer, 
DeRue 

announced new diversity initiatives 
at the Business School through a $6 
million dollar gift from Stephen 
M. Ross and Jeff Blau. The new 
Blau Initiative for Diversity in 
Real Estate and Infrastructure 
is designed to offer high school 
students from underrepresented 
backgrounds 
internships 
and 

learning experiences in real estate 
and investing. The new Related 
Scholars 
Fund 
will 
provide 

scholarships to support students 
from diverse backgrounds who 
are underrepresented in business 
leadership.

Students like Donald Lindsay, 

an MBA student and co-president 
of the Black Business Students 
Association, have also called on the 
administration to hire more Black 
faculty members.

“If I see another Black person or 

Black faculty in the program, I feel 
a little bit more comfortable than 
if I didn’t, because I’m thinking, 
‘Man, if I need to talk to somebody, 
I’d probably talk to that person,’” 
Lindsay said. “That’s something 
that’s undervalued.”

There were eight Black or 

African American faculty members 
and 141 white faculty members in 
the Business School as of November 
2019, according to the University’s 
Office of Public Affairs.

Bell said in her experience, 

most Black faculty members are 
concentrated in the marketing 
track at the Business School.

“There are literally no Black 

faculty around,” Bell said. “ … If 
you’re not a marketing student or 
if you’re not interested in anything 
with the marketing focus, you 
can go through four years of Ross 
without having a Black professor, 
easily.”

DeRue said he recognizes there 

is much work to be done regarding 
increasing faculty of color within 
the Business School. 

“If you look at all the accredited 

business schools in the country, 
we’re slightly above average,” 
DeRue said. “That’s not good 
enough.” 

DeRue said the Business School 

wants to prioritize DEI in faculty 
hiring, especially with doctoral 
students. This year, the Business 
School’s doctoral program was 
awarded a Rackham Faculty Allies 

Diversity grant to support its 
diversity initiative. 

Disappointment 
with 
the 

Business School’s namesake

Black students in the Business 

School said they were disappointed 
that the school is named after 
Stephen Ross, a Michigan alum 
and founder and chairman of 
Related Companies, because of 
Ross’s political affiliations. In 
August 2019, Ross held a fundraiser 
for Donald Trump which raised 
$12 million. The move upset some 
students, 
who 
demanded 
the 

Business School be renamed. 

The backlash highlighted anger 

over racism stemming from the 
president’s office, such as Trump’s 
response to violence at a white 
supremacist rally in Charlottesville 
in which he blamed “both sides” for 
the conflict.

Naja Edwards, a Business School 

alum and former MBA Council 
President, said that her fellow 
Business students were angry 
after hearing the news of Ross’s 
fundraiser. 

“In my opinion, there was a lot 

of pushback from MBA students,” 
Edwards said. “They know the 
deal. Donald Trump is a polarizing 
figure.”

Lindsay said he is “painfully 

aware” the school is named after 
one of the largest Trump campaign 
supporters. 

“The fact that he’s a Republican 

is probably neither here nor there,” 
Lindsay said. “But (he is) someone 
who’s actively supported someone 
who represents a lot of what’s 
wrong in this country.”

DeRue said he appreciates Ross’s 

support and that he has been of 
great value to the Business School, 
specifically through programs like 
the Ross Initiative in Sports for 
Equality, which works to empower 
and educate the sports community 
to end racial discrimination.

“Stephen Ross has been a true 

champion of higher education,” 
DeRue said. “He’s been a true 
champion of fighting for social 
injustice and inequality … and we 
are very grateful to Stephen and all 
of his support.”

Concerns 
regarding 
the 

transparency in DEI efforts

Many Black students have said 

there is a lack of transparency and 
accountability within the Business 
School 
administration’s 
DEI 

efforts. 

DeRue’s statement after the 

police killing of George Floyd 
sparked 
criticism 
from 
some 

students who took issue with the 
wording he used. 

“Like so many of you, I have 

watched in horror the recent 
events 
in 
Minneapolis 
where 

George Floyd died while in the 
custody of police officers,” DeRue 
wrote. “Mr. Floyd’s senseless and 
tragic death has motivated days of 
protests across our country, and 
I want to recognize the pain, fear, 
anger, and hopelessness that many 
are experiencing, especially those 
in our Black and African American 
community.”

According to Business junior 

Bolaji Gaba, BBUS vice president 
of corporate relations, some Black 
students said they were angered by 
the timing and content of DeRue’s 
statement. They specifically took 
issue with DeRue referring to 
Floyd’s murder as a “senseless 
and tragic death,” instead of 
acknowledging that white police 
officers killed Floyd.

DeRue later apologized for his 

choice of words through a follow-
up email and town hall. 

DeRue said he did not intend in 

any way to discount the killing of 
Floyd, and hearing feedback from 
Business students was a moment of 
growth for him.

“I took full ownership of the 

choice of words, in terms of 
describing the killing of George 
Floyd as his death,” DeRue said. 
“I was truly heartbroken that my 
choice of words caused the pain 

that it did to our students. Also, it 
was a learning moment for me, and 
so I really appreciated the feedback 
that our students gave in terms of 
that word choice.”

Later that week, the Business 

School held a DEI Virtual Town 
Hall 
discussing 
the 
school’s 

approach to racial justice, where 
DeRue publicly apologized for 
his statement. There were 420 
Business School faculty, staff and 
students in attendance, according 
to Bridget Vis, Business School 
public relations specialist.

Edwards 
said 
Business 

graduate students were initially 
disheartened by the DeRue’s first 
statement, which did not include 
a specific plan on how the school 
would reduce racial discrimination.

“That 
created 
this 
whole 

sentiment 
amongst 
the 
MBA 

students where everybody was just 
like, ‘There needs to be more here. 
People need to be held accountable, 
there needs to be concrete action, 
there needs to be an action plan,’” 
Edwards said.

After talking with the BBSA 

and other members of the Business 
School, DeRue released a second 
statement on June 10 that included 
a 14-step action plan to promote 
and improve DEI initiatives. DeRue 
listed steps to improve diversity 
within teaching and learning 
practices, leadership teams and 
human resources policies. 

The Black Business students 

The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 
had 

mixed feelings about the second 
statement. Some were hopeful 
that this plan would reduce racism 
and discrimination while others 
remained skeptical.

Collins said while he did 

appreciate having a specific action 
plan, he empathized with students’ 
frustration. 

“The frustration that students 

feel in regards to like, ‘Is this 
lip service, is this real, will this 
happen?’ is a completely fair, 
understandable and arguably, the 
right frustration that should be 
felt,” Collins said. “I feel it too, and 
I think that is the right frustration 
to have, and until there are 
receipts of actually realizing 
those promises, they should be 
frustrated, absolutely.” 

Taylor said she thinks the 

Business 
administration 
is 

making a genuine effort to 
improve its DEI initiatives, 
but she said she would not 
have this same view if she 
did not have close ties with 
the 
administration 
through 

programs like BBUS.

“If 
I 
didn’t 
have 
those 

relationships and actually hear 
from their mouth that they were 
trying to do stuff, on a regular 
day, even walking through the 
Winter Garden, I wouldn’t be 
able to tell a thing,” Taylor said. 

DeRue 
recognized 
that 

students might not be aware 
of 
the 
administration’s 
DEI 

initiatives.

“To any student who feels 

disconnected from our efforts 
or that we’re not engaging, we 
want to engage, and I would 
encourage those students to 
either reach out to me directly, 
reach out to our team, engage 
in the workshops and the events 
that we are holding so that we 
can work together to accomplish 
our shared goals,” DeRue said.

Bethel said he hopes the 

Business School continues to 
focus 
on 
combatting 
racial 

discrimination.

“I definitely think continuing 

to keep the conversation going 
is important, but I think what’s 
more important is following 
up and actions and not letting 
something distract us from what 
we’re trying to achieve,” Bethel 
said.

“I couldn’t stand Northwood 

anymore,” Thedford said. “It’s 
just crazy there and more kids 
who test positive are literally 
right next to you. For my safety, 
I thought it was best if I just 
went home cause I have the 
luxury of living an hour away.”

The 
conditions 
at 
the 

University’s quarantine housing 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 

numerous complaints — and a 
viral Tik Tok — by students sent 
to isolate there. Residents have 
voiced concerns about a lack of 
sanitation, the low quality of 
the meal delivery service and 
limited communication between 
them and the University. In 
response to the criticism, the 
University created a new job to 
oversee students and conditions 
in quarantine housing. 

Martin 
said 
while 
the 

first set of data to come from 
surveillance testing recorded 
zero positive tests, she would 
“love to get as many people 
signed up as possible” to collect 
more data from students. 

Public 
Health 
graduate 

student Peter DeJonge works 
with Martin in the surveillance 
testing program. DeJonge also 
encouraged students to sign 
up for the program, saying it 
benefits the community. 

“I would encourage people 

to sign up,” DeJonge said. 
“Everyone will eventually be 
selected to come in and collect 
the self swab. We give their 
results back pretty quickly. It 
contributes to the overall well-
being of campus and there’s 
very little hassle to make an 
appointment.”

Thedford 
brought 
up 

concerns 
about 
the 
newly 

reinstated 
football 
season 

affecting testing and contact 
tracing, saying tailgates could 
negatively impact the progress 
of the CTC.

“If a positive person goes to 

a tailgate, there’s no point (in 
contact 
tracing),” 
Thedford 

said. 

“It’s just not effective because 

if a kid has COVID, they’re only 
going to say the five close friends 
that they know of and everyone 
else is just going to walk freely. I 
think contact tracing is going to 
have a big issue coming up and 
we’re going to see an influx of 

people entering Northwood. It’s 
just going to keep getting worse 
and worse.”

While COVID-19 surveillance 

testing 
has 
faced 
backlash 

over privacy concerns, Martin 
said their program is based on 
influenza surveillance, which is 
a common program in the state 
of Michigan.

“So we watch what’s going 

on at doctors’ offices, we watch 
what’s going on at the hospitals, 
we watch what people are 
reporting in the community,” 
Martin said. “But we also kind 
of go out and do targeted testing 
to figure out if influenza is here 
yet. Is it going? Is it getting 
higher? And that gives us an 
extra 
piece 
of 
information 

to help us tailor how we’re 
responding (to the virus).”

DeJonge said surveillance 

testing is important among 
college students because many 
virus carriers are asymptomatic.

“With 
any 
communicable 

disease 
or 
something 
that 

people can spread from person 
to person, it’s important for 
the community to know what’s 
out there,” DeJonge said. “So 
the surveillance that we do is 
important to just recognize how 
many people are out there, we 
don’t know about and wouldn’t 
know about because they never 
will have symptoms.”

Racial disparities persist in 

the pandemic’s impact, with 
Black and Hispanic Americans 
bearing the brunt of the virus. 
Martin said some marginalized 
communities 
have 
been 

negatively 
affected 
by 
the 

medical system and may be 
unwilling to participate in 
these surveillance programs.

“I think that we need to be 

mindful of both sides of the 
people that would feel safer 
with 
mandatory 
testing,” 

Martin said. “I think we need 
to acknowledge that there 
are communities of people 
that both have reasons that 
they don’t want to participate in 
mandatory testing, but then also 
may have had experiences with 
the medical system and public 
health surveillance systems that 
may make them uncomfortable. 
With that kind of mandate, I 
think we need to acknowledge 
that and also as part of the 
conversation.”

About 50 people and public 

officials attended a virtual 
public 
hearing 
with 
the 

Washtenaw County Board of 
Commissioners, Ann Arbor 
City Council, Scio Township 
Board of Trustees and the 
Huron Watershed Council 
regarding the Gelman Plume 
Litigation 
Settlement 
on 

Thursday evening. U.S. Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., 

moderated the hearing. 

The 
Gelman 
Plume 
is 

the spread of the chemical 
1,4-dioxane into soil and 
groundwater in northwest 
Ann 
Arbor, 
polluting 

residents’ 
water 
sources. 

Gelman 
Sciences 
used 

the 
probable 
carcinogen 

1,4-dioxane to manufacture 
microporous filters from 1966 
to 1986 and did not dispose of 
their waste water properly. 
Unchecked use allowed the 
contaminant to spread into a 
large underground plume. 

In August, city officials 

proposed an agreement on a 
potential plan to clean up the 
Gelman Plume, which has 
been met with criticism from 
Ann Arbor residents. 
Thursday’s 
meeting 

aimed to inform the 
public 
about 
this 

settlement agreement 
and 
address 
pre-

submitted questions. 

Attorney 
Fred 

Dindoffer 
of 
Ann 

Arbor’s 
legal 
team 

explained 
that 

most 
of 
the 
new 

amendments 
fall 

within a document 
called 
the 
Consent 

Judgement and the 
stipulated 
order. 

Some 
key 
changes 

and additions include 
an expansion of the 
prohibition 
zone 

for pollution, a new 
exposure limit and 
increased 
pumping 

and 
treatment 
of 

polluted water.

Additionally, 

the 
new 
proposed 

agreement prohibits 
all city governments from 
requesting cleanup by the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency, and states Gelman 
Sciences is not liable for the 
contamination. 

“By 
entering 
into 

this 
Consent 
Judgment, 

Defendant does not admit 
any of the allegations of the 
Complaint, does not admit 
any fault or liability under 
any statutory or common 
law, and does not waive any 
rights, claims, or defenses 
with respect to any person,” 
the document reads. 

Dindoffer clarified why the 

Consent Judgment doesn’t 
explicitly hold Gelman at 
fault. 

“This CJ doesn’t require 

Gelman to admit that it’s 
liable or at fault,” Dindoffer 
said. 
“That’s 
a 
standard 

provision 
that’s 
put 
into 

virtually 
every 
consent 

judgement 
that 
we 
ever 

would see, the purpose is 
that if there’s ever a dispute 
about the CJ in the future 
and if there’s a breaking 
down of relations, Gelman 
can bring evidence in and 
force an opponent to prove 
that it’s actually at fault.”

Ann Arbor resident James 

D’Amour who is a member 
of the Coalition for Action 
on Remediation of Dioxane 
expressed his concern with 
the inability to work with the 
EPA if the Consent Judgment 
is accepted.

“Hundreds of thousands of 

dollars spent on legal fees and 
it appears that the proposed 
fourth 
consent 
judgement 

does not bring us any closer to 
cleaning up the plume, in fact 
it gives Danaher the ability 

to walk away from the mess,” 
Demoore said. “If this is 
accepted local governments 
waive the right to petition 
USEPA for complete cleanup, 
so we have the prospects of 
a larger exclusive zone with 
possibly less cleanup than 
before.” 

Dr. Larry Lemke, who 

said 
he 
has 
researched 

1,4-dioxane 
for 
over 
20 

years, gave a presentation on 
the proposed contamination 
clean up plan. 

“We know that there are 

multiple plumes, migrating 
in 
multiple 
directions 
at 

multiple depths, so this is 
truly a three dimensional 
problem,” Lemke said. “The 
proposed 
fourth 
amended 

CJ includes a number of 
additional monitoring wells 
in key positions... Are these 
wells going to completely 
delineate dioxane to 7.2 parts 
per billion everywhere? No, 
it’s not even close. Are these 
wells 
placed 
in 
sensible 

places however? Yes.”

The 
proposed 
Consent 

Judgement will have Gelman 
treat polluted groundwater 
and 
discharge 
it 
back 

into First Sister Lake at 
a rate of 200 gallons per 
minute. When asked about 

alternatives to this solution, 
Lemke explained there will 
always 
be 
many 
options 

available and none will be 
perfect.

“Other potential solutions 

might include a pipeline back 
to the Gelman treatment 
site, 
they 
might 
include 

reinjection of that water back 
down into the aquifer after 
its been treated, it might 
be piping it to somewhere 
else, 
another 
option 
is 

using the city’s sanctuary 
sewer,” Lemke said. “Every 
environmental solution has 
a trade off, there is an upside 
and a downside to every 
single one of those.” 

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Alexander Weinstein, who 
lives on Second Sister Lake 
and whose well would be 
directly affected by the new 
settlement, urged the public 
officials present to reject 
the proposal because of the 
pollution it would bring to 
his home and community. 

“The document gives the 

polluter permission to dump 
carcinogens 
of 
dioxane 

and bromate directly into 
the sister lake through the 
Park Lake well as one of its 
methods for disposing of the 
cleanup,” 
Weinstein 
said. 

“Most importantly there is a 
viable alternative, a pipeline 
could be run to the Gelman 
treatment 
site, 
it 
would 

be a cost but a completely 
reasonable one.”

Lemke 
continued 
to 

explain 
phytoremediation, 

which is the practice of 
removing 1,4-dioxane from 
the 
ground 
using 
trees 

and is part of the amended 
Consent 
Judgement. 
This 

is 
a 
relatively 
new 
and 

experimental 
plan 
and 

Lemke clarified it should be 
considered a trial. 

“This 
is 
an 
emerging 

technology so we should 
treat this as a pilot project 
and learn from it,” Lemke 
said. “The idea is that the 
dioxane 
moves 
with 
the 

groundwater 
to 
the 
tree 

roots and there it’s either 
transformed by bacteria in 
the roots into something 
that the tree can use, or 
it enters as dioxane that’s 
dissolved in the water, then 
it flows through the tree’s 
water transport system and 
eventually gets transpired to 
the atmosphere through the 
leaves.” 

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Jacqueline 
Courteau 

explained 
her 
hesitancy 

to support this particular 
plan without more concrete 
evidence.

“I’m 
wondering 
why 

there are no performance 
standards or metrics to assess 
how the phytoremediation 
is 
performing,” 
Courteau 

said. “I work with trees. I 
love trees, but I don’t think 
that 
just 
planting 
trees 

and hoping they’ll work is 
adequate.”

Lemke 
answered 

questions pre-submitted 
by members of the public 
about possible dioxane 
contamination of Barton 
Pond, Ann Arbor’s main 
drinking water source.

“The 
risk 
of 

1,4-dioxane moving up 
there is small, but the 
potential consequences 
are large and we can’t 
rule it out with complete 
certainty,” Lemke said. 
“If 
dioxane 
got 
into 

the 
subsurface 
north 

of M-14, west of Wines 
Elementary School, it 
could have a potential 
flow 
path 
down 
to 

Barton Pond.”

Members of the public 

were able to address 
the officials in an open 
forum, 
all 
of 
whom 

unanimously expressed 
their disapproval of the 
proposed clean up plan 
and urged them to not 

accept it. 

Ann 
Arbor 
and 
Scio 

Township 
resident 
Dan 

Bicknell was very vocal in his 
assurances that the proposed 
cleanup 
plan 
would 
do 

nothing to stop the dioxane 
pollution 
and 
strongly 

encouraged a rejection of it. 

“The 
proposed 
fourth 

amendment 
consent 

judgement is a continuation 
of the current CJ pollution 
remedy which will not stop 
the 
dioxane 
plume 
from 

expanding towards the Ann 
Arbor Township wells, Scio 
Township 
wells, 
Barton 

Hill village wells or Barton 
Pond,” Bicknell said. “The 
shallow plume will continue 
to travel through the city 
unabated.” 

Congresswoman 
Dingell 

ended 
the 
meeting 
by 

urging everybody involved 
to 
stay 
transparent 
and 

communicate openly to clean 
up the plume. 

“I would urge those who 

are participating that the 
more information they can 
make transparent the better 
it is, because people who don’t 
know what’s not being made 
public don’t understand why 
it’s not being made public 
and it contributes to people’s 
lack of confidence,” Dingell 
said. “Dissent and pitting 
people against each other is 
what we’ve seen happen at a 
national level for four years, 
let’s not let it happen in 
Washtenaw County, let’s get 
this cleaned up.”

The University of Michigan 

added outside testing counts 
to its COVID-19 dashboard on 
Thursday, more than doubling 
the total number of positive 
cases at the University since the 
start of the fall semester. 

The total positive case count 

since Aug. 30, the day before 
the start of the school year, was 
257 as of Thursday evening. On 
Wednesday afternoon, before 
the University started including 
off-campus tests that weren’t 
self-reported, the dashboard 
reported 117 positive cases in 
the same time period.

The University posted an 

update on its Campus Blueprint 
website to explain the new data. 

“University 
officials 
have 

seen a significant increase in 
positive cases this week with 
the majority of the increase the 
result of students being tested 
at off-campus facilities,” the 
update reads. “U-M launched its 
enhanced COVID-19 dashboard 
today to reflect new datasets, 
including outside testing from 
the county. This additional data 
caused a jump in cases.”

Most of these new cases are 

from students living in off-
campus, congregate housing, 
according to the update. In an 
email to The Michigan Daily, 
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen said “it’s up to the 
county health department to 
officially identify off-campus 
clusters.”

The University’s dashboard 

previously reported only outside 
testing data that had been self-
reported to the University. The 
University is now reporting 
testing data connected to the 
University that are performed 
at off-campus testing sites, 
provided by the Washtenaw 
County Health Department. 

Before Thursday’s update, 

most of the positive cases 
identified on the dashboard 
were through University testing 
channels, such as University 
Health Service for students 
and 
Occupational 
Health 

Services for faculty and staff. 
Now, positive cases identified 
through outside testing make 
up more than half of all positive 
cases identified in the last two 
weeks. 

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

communications 
and 
health 

promotion 
administrator 
of 

Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department, told The Daily 
the change in the dashboard 
does not reflect a change in 
the relationship between the 
University and the WCHD. In 
other words, all the cases now 
reported on the dashboard, 

while adding to the confirmed 
number of University-specific 
cases, were previously known 
to both parties.

“Do 
I 
think 
that 
(the 

dashboard 
update) 
changes 

represent 
cases 
that 
were 

unknown to either the county 
or the University? No, I don’t,” 
Ringler-Cerniglia said. “Is it 
better reflecting the scope of 
cases that are connected to the 
University? Yes, probably.”

According 
to 
Ringler-

Cerniglia, 
the 
Washtenaw 

County Health Department is 
made aware of all positive cases 
in the county, whether they are 
tested on campus or off campus. 
After case investigation and 
contact tracing, the department 
has a legal agreement to report 
to the University all cases that 
are confirmed to be connected 
to campus. 

Ringler-Cerniglia also said 

the health department helps 
the University conduct its own 
contact tracing.

“When the students were just 

returning, the University didn’t 
have enough contact tracers 
and case investigators up and 
hired and ready to go,” Ringler-
Cerniglia said. “So, we, as the 
health department, took over 
some of that initially, and then it 
shifted back. Now it sounds like 
there’s a little bit of an increase 
of cases that we’re helping out 
again.”

To determine if a positive 

case is linked to the University, 
the health department checks 
to see if the case is linked to 
an on-campus or near-campus 
address. 
Case 
investigators 

also flag tests conducted in the 
county that are linked to an 
out-of-state address, as Ringler-
Cerniglia said those are likely 
students using their permanent 
address instead of their campus 
address.

Business freshman Nathan 

Lewis said he turned to an off-
campus testing center to get a 
rapid test after he was exposed 
to the virus.

“(This urgent care) had a 

rapid test and I wanted a rapid 
test because I was exposed to 
the virus last week,” Lewis 
said. “I didn’t want to semi-
quarantine in my dorm and I 
didn’t want to not know exactly 
if I had it or not.”

Lewis 
said 
he 
was 
not 

planning 
on 
reporting 
his 

negative result to the University. 

“I’m not going to report my 

result because, to be honest, I 
don’t know where to report it,” 
Lewis said.

Ringler-Cerniglia said the 

health department is seeing an 
increase in students going to 
off-campus facilities for rapid 
testing. Because these tests 
are not to the same standard 
as the regular PCR tests, the 
health 
department 
reports 

rapid testing positive results as 

“probable cases.” 

While a rapid positive test 

result is trustworthy, Ringler-
Cerniglia said rapid tests have 
higher rates of false negatives. 
Though she understands that 
students may find same-day 
test results appealing, she’s 
worried students may put too 
much stock in a rapid negative 
test result. 

“What’s 
happening 
with 

this influx of cases — lately, it 
looks like there’s a number of 
them that were tested using 
rapid antigen testing at some 
of the local urgent cares,” 
Ringler-Cerniglia 
said. 
“... 

Let’s say they’re using this to 
justify going to a gathering. So 
I go and get my rapid test, and 
I go to a party. We’d be highly 
concerned that that could be a 
false negative.”

The 
availability 
of 
rapid 

testing for athletes is a major 
reason the Big Ten decided to 
reinstate the football season 
this fall. Each school in the 
league plans on testing players 
every day starting on or before 
Sept. 30.

Ringler-Cerniglia said the 

county receives only the number 
of positive cases, not the number 
of tests that are completed in 
total. So, the county does not 
know what proportion of tests 
being 
conducted 
are 
rapid 

result testing.

For 
the 
same 
reason, 

Broekhuizen 
said 
the 

University’s 
dashboard 
only 

reports 
positivity 
rates 
for 

on-campus testing, which last 
week was at 1.3 percent.

“Since 
only 
positive 
test 

results are required to be 
reported to the county/state, we 
do not know the total number of 
off-campus tests administered,” 
Broekhuizen 
said. 
“Without 

that number, we are not able to 
calculate the positivity rate.”

Residence hall data was also 

updated Thursday. As of Sept. 
19, the dashboard reports 64 
total cases discovered in the 
residence halls, with 36 of 
these cases discovered in the 
preceding week. As of Friday 
morning, 25 cases have been 
confirmed in residence halls 
since Sept. 19. 

All 
students 
who 
tested 

positive and all known contacts 
in residence halls have been 
moved 
to 
quarantine 
and 

isolation, the update said.

Last week, the University 

announced that 19 positive 
cases were discovered in South 
Quad, the first official cluster 
of 
COVID-19 
in 
University 

residence halls. The University 
tested 221 South Quad students 
after discovering the cluster, 
and all results came back 
negative, 
according 
to 
the 

University.

Deal to resolve longrunning controversy over pollution

Students and faculty work to adapt to hybrid courses

With 22 percent of LSA 

classes being taught in the 
hybrid or in-person format, the 
disconnect between students 
in the classroom and students 
on Zoom coupled with the 
technological learning curve 
has 
proved 
challenging 
for 

hybrid courses. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Michelle 

Ascrizzi is enrolled in a hybrid 
Honors 
first-year 
writing 

course, which provides students 
the option to attend lectures 
either in person or online, 
with discussions taking place 
entirely online. Despite living 
in an apartment in Ann Arbor, 
Ascrizzi has opted to “Zoom” 
into lecture every Tuesday and 
Thursday morning. 

“For now I’ve just been 

attending entirely online, my 
reason being I traveled to get 
here so with staying in a hotel 
and moving in and everything, 
I wanted to lie low for the first 
two weeks to make sure I didn’t 
have any symptoms that I could 
pass on to anyone,” Ascrizzi 
said. “Also with everything 
going on, I felt really nervous, 
personally, about going to an 
in-person class right now so I 
decided I’d rather go online and 
see how the first two weeks of 
classes went.”

In-person students don’t use 

microphones in Ascrizzi’s class, 
which has created a lapse in 
communication between virtual 
students and in-person students. 

“The hardest thing is that 

for 
classes 
that 
are 
really 

discussion-based, 
you 
can’t 

hear what the people in the 
classroom are saying usually, 
and that can be helped by if the 
professor repeats back what 
they said,” Ascrizzi said. “I 
feel engaged when people on 
Zoom are talking but then when 
people in the room are talking, 
it’s more difficult to follow the 
discussion.”

In an email to The Daily, 

Faith 
Sparr, 
communication 

and 
media 
lecturer 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, said she 
was advised to pass a handheld 
microphone 
from 
student 

to student in order to allow 
students on Zoom to hear those 
attending class in person. 

“I 
declined 
that 
solution 

and luckily my room is now 
equipped with an overhead mic 
system, but I know of one other 
hybrid lecturer that is still using 
the handheld mic as a solution,” 
Sparr wrote. “I attended several 
training sessions to get ready for 
the term that were technology-
based, 
not 
health 
protocol-

based. Health protocol was 
never really emphasized to me 
as an in-person/hybrid lecturer 
and I am still surprised by that.”

LSA lecturer Anne Manuel 

is currently teaching Political 
Science 495 in a similar hybrid 
format 
as 
Ascrizzi’s 
class. 

Manuel said she prepared for 
the class by playing around with 
the technology she’d been using 
before classes began. 

“First, I did a training with 

a couple other instructors that 
took about an hour and then I 
was able to get into the room, 
Angell G115, to practice on my 
own,” Manuel said. “It’s one 
of those things where it’s both 

the time to learn the software 
and the repetition required to 
adapt.”

Along 
with 
navigating 

technology, 
Manuel 
believes 

equally 
dividing 
attention 

between virtual and in-person 
students 
is 
another 
new 

challenge. 

“When you’re in a room 

where you have some students 
in the room and some students at 
home, it’s interesting to attend 
to the people in the room and 
attend to the people on Zoom,” 
Manuel said. “The other tricky 
thing about teaching now is 
that there’s a part of your brain 
that is running the technology 
and a part of your brain that’s 
thinking of the content while 
making sure (I) attend to both 
groups of students so it can be 
hard to keep everything going.” 

LSA instructors may be able to 

switch to a fully remote format 
if the hybrid format becomes 
too challenging, according to 
Manuel. 

“In political science in LSA, 

my 
understanding 
is 
that 

we have a lot of control over 
whether we’re teaching hybrid 
and remote and we have the 
option to switch to remote 
teaching if needed, as long as we 
notify our department,” Manuel 
said. 

Manuel thinks one way to 

possibly ease the disconnect in 
hybrid classes could be cameras 
offering a different view of the 
classroom and students. 

“Right now, there’s just a 

camera in the room that goes 
from the back of the room to 
the front towards the stage, 
so another thing you could 

have is a camera going in the 
other direction pointed on the 
students so that people on Zoom 
can see the students in the room 
and 
when 
they’re 
talking,” 

Manuel said. 

Business lecturer Amy Angell 

is teaching two sections of the 
course Marketing 313, both 
in the hybrid format. Each 
classroom she uses has certain 
limitations on the number of 
students allowed — a little more 
than one-third of her students 
must attend through Zoom — 
however, she offers flexibility 
for those who usually attend 
in-person. 

Angell has experience with 

teaching hybrid courses and is 
comfortable teaching in this 
format this semester, noting 

great 
cooperation 
between 

the University and students in 
following safety measures. 

“I’ve taught hybrid before at 

a different institution so I knew 
right away it was going to be 
challenging as it is oftentimes 
double the work,” she said. “I 
will say that there have been 
great 
efforts 
with 
training 

and enhancing the classrooms 
with microphones and a large 
monitor to see our remote 
students and there’s been great 
communication by Ross and 
(the University) so I’m never 
fearful about getting COVID or 
anything like that.”

According 
to 
Angell, 
the 

biggest challenge for her is 
creating 
relationships 
with 

her students and letting go of 

aspects of her usual teaching 
style. 

“(It can get) hot to teach in 

a mask and it’s confining to 
not be able to move around 
the classroom like I usually 
do to create that personability 
with 
my 
students,” 
Angell 

said. “It’s hard maintaining 
equity between my hybrid and 
remote students and it’s hard 
for me to get to know my hybrid 
students because when they 
come in person they’re wearing 
a mask but when they’re online 
they’re not wearing a mask 
... it’s definitely a disjointed 
community.”

Minutes into her ultrasound 

appointment in February of 
2019, Alyson Irwin, who was 20 
weeks pregnant at the time, and 
her husband Phil Irwin saw the 
technician turn off the screen 
and leave the room to get their 
physician.

“We knew something was 

going on right away,” Alyson said. 
“We had to sit there and wait and 
try to figure out what was going 
on. It felt pretty tense.”

The physician arrived and 

broke the news to the Irwins.

“They were pretty blunt about 

it and told us, ‘You’re pregnant 
with conjoined twins. I’m really, 
really sorry, but you’re going to 
have to decide what you’re going 
to do,’” Alyson said. “We felt 
pretty devastated. It’s just not 
something you would expect at 
all.” 

One day later, the couple met 

with Dr. George Mychaliska, 
professor of pediatric surgery 
and obstetrics and gynecology. 
Mychaliska imaged the twins 
and 
counseled 
the 
couple 

through the process. Last month, 
the twins underwent the first 
known separation surgery at 
Michigan Medicine and in the 
state of Michigan. 

“I counseled them back in the 

day when their babies were still 
fetuses,” Mychaliska said. “At 
that time, we had sophisticated 
imaging, including ultrasound, 
fetal MRI and fetal echo, which 
gave us a lot of anatomical 
information 
and 
we 
were 

hopeful a separation surgery 
would be possible.”

Alyson and Phil continued 

to see Mychaliska and his team 
throughout the pregnancy. The 
twins, Sarabeth and Amelia, 
were born on June 11, 2019. Born 
prematurely, the twins spent 
three months in the neonatal 
intensive care unit. 

“It was kind of surreal,” 

Alyson said. “We knew the birth 
would take a while, and I would 
be stuck away from the girls for 
a while. But I was eventually able 
to hold the girls after a couple of 
hours, and it was very surreal to 
hold them.”

Sarabeth and Amelia were 

born conjoined from their chest 
to belly. Mychaliska noted both 
girls had separate hearts, lungs 
and 
gastrointestinal 
tracts, 

making them good candidates 
for separation surgery. Though 
their livers were fused together, 
he said the team knew they could 
separate the organ.

While the Irwins adjusted 

to a new life, they also began 
working with their care team to 
plan for the separation surgery.

“We were always on the 

same page. Given the specifics 
of conjoined twins, it’s just not 
very positive-looking,” Phil said. 
“If the girls were to make it and 
have any chance at all, it would 
be if they were separated. That 
was both of our mindsets from 
the beginning. We wanted to 
give them a life where they could 
live their best life independently 
from each other.”

Mychaliska led the surgical 

team, which consisted of more 
than two dozen specialists. 

“I 
think 
it’s 
really 
an 

example of the importance of 
collaboration, because there’s 
no single physician who has the 
expertise in all of these areas,” 
Mychaliska said. “We all put our 
heads together and innovated 
solutions, and if we weren’t able 
to work as a team, we wouldn’t 
have been able to do this. I’m 
convinced of that.”

Mychaliska emphasized that 

the Irwin twins are extremely 
rare. He said about one in 
100,000 to 200,000 pregnancies 
involve 
conjoined 
twins. 

Mychaliska said many conjoined 
twins aren’t able to survive. 

After being closed for six 

months due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, the University 
of 
Michigan 
Department 

of Recreational Sports will 
reopen 
campus 
recreation 

facilities this coming Monday, 
Sept. 28. 

The reopening comes after 

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

announced on Sept. 3 that 
gyms across the state would 
be allowed to resume business 
as part of the state’s reopening 
plan.

“A 
number 
of 
changes 

have been made to ensure 
the 
safety 
and 
cleanliness 

of the recreation spaces,” a 

University 
Record 
release 

reads. 
“Students 
and 

Recreational Sports members 
will be required to make 
reservations to work out and 
to swim, face coverings will 
be required while working out, 
and facilities will be operating 
at decreased capacities and 
hours to allow for increased 
cleaning during the day.”

According 
to 
the 

announcement, other changes 
include 
plexiglass 
barriers 

at the front desks, increased 
disposable 
wipe 
and 
hand 

sanitizer locations, increased 
staffing 
for 
cleaning, 
gym 

equipment distanced at least 10 
feet apart, personal protective 
equipment and required health 
screenings for all Rec Sports 
employees. 

Despite 
the 
facilities 

reopening, 
certain 
services 

will remain closed off to 
students, including use of all 
courts including basketball, 
racquetball, 
badminton, 

volleyball 
and 
squash, 
as 

well as indoor rentals and 
recreational programming. 

The 
announcement 
also 

made note of a new Rec 
Sports application that will 
“allow for contactless entry 
to the facilities, make facility 
and pool reservations, find 
building hours and more.” 
The app is currently available 
for download in the Apple 
App Store for iPhone and the 
Google Play Store. 

Director 
of 
Recreational 

Sports Mike Widen said that 
although the gyms will look 
and work different than they 
did before, he’s excited for 
them to open back up. 

“After being closed for over 

six months, we are excited to be 
able to reopen the Recreational 
Sports facilities and serve the 
health and wellbeing needs of 
our students and our members,” 
Widen said. “The experience 
will look a little different 
than it did previously. But we 
believe we’ve established a 
number of new protocols that 
will keep our guests and our 
employees safe. We’ve started 
by reducing capacities at each 
facility and requiring each 
guest to make a reservation for 
their workout on our new U-M 
Recreational Sports app. These 
steps will help us limit the 
total number of people in each 
facility.”

‘It’s definitely a disjointed community’: Transition to digital learning requires flexibility, patience amid pandemic

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily

Students attend their Zoom class from the Diag during the first week of the semester. 

MICHAL RUPRECHT

Daily Staff Reporter


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan In Color
6 — Wednesday, September 30, 2020 

As a first-year living on 

campus during a widespread 
pandemic, my concerns about 
daily life at the Univeringly 
continue 
to 
increase. 
The 

administration does not seem 
to be taking the struggles of 
students into consideration, 
evident from the increase 
in our tuition, prevalence of 
lab fees and blatant lack of 
student testing. When I sit 
at home, watching my asyn-
chronous recorded lectures, I 
can’t help but wonder whether 
attending this school right 
now is worth the thousands 
of dollars I am paying. And 
when I receive an email that 
announces the reintroduction 
of the Big Ten football season, 
I definitely begin to consider 
whether getting my degree is 
worth risking my life.

In 
complete 
candidness, 

it is very hard to argue that 
any class should be in-person. 
You can attempt to justify it 
by pointing out students are 
undergoing regular testing, 
though they truly aren’t, but 
consider my situation: I am a 
freshman living in an apart-
ment complex on campus. 
There is no requirement to test 
me or anyone else in the build-
ing who also has in-person 
classes. One week ago, I called 
the COVID hotline offered 
by the University to report a 
party that could literally be 
heard three floors above me. 
After explaining that nobody 
is close enough to do anything, 
I was referred to building 
security, who referred me to 
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment, who said the only option 
available was to file a noise 
complaint. It is a frustratingly 
ignorant assumption to think 
that socially starved teenag-
ers in one apartment complex 
will choose to remain socially 
distant. And the resources 
that have been offered to 
tackle gatherings which dis-
regard COVID-19 guidelines 
have been of no use. It is more 
abhorrent that the university 
has prioritized profit over the 
health and safety of its stu-
dents. Quite frankly, even edu-
cation is not a valid reason to 
group college students togeth-
er during a pandemic — health 
and safety must obviously be 
the number one priority. 

Testing 
students 
for 

COVID, one of my only hopes 
for a semblance of safety on 
campus, has been abysmal. 
From early August to Aug. 
20, there were a total of 1,306 
tests administered: a number 
which seems ridiculously low, 
and not nearly large enough to 
actually determine how many 
students are walking around 
campus infected. With nearly 
30,000 students, only around 
4-5 percent were tested in the 
beginning of August; a rate 
that clearly shows where the 
University’s priority lies. Now 
the University has promised to 
increase testing up to 6,000 a 
week by the end of September. 
This is an effort I appreciate, 

but it’s not enough. Where is 
the logic in pairing new safety 
efforts with reopening the Big 
Ten football season? Granted, 
football players will all under-
go testing, and players that 
test positive for COVID will 
be forced to sit out of the game 
for a minimum of 21 days. But 
has the University not learned 
that 
reintroducing 
popular 

entertainment is cause for 
more reckless get-togethers 
among college students? 

Aside from the seemingly 

contradictory policies, it is 
hard for me to wrap my head 
around the concept of paying 
more money to be in a place 
where my health is not a pri-
ority. The $50 fee required 
from each student, which was 
used to create the masks and 
kits, made me wonder why the 
university had not utilized 
its other forms of income and 
endowments which could have 
provided these essentials for 
life on campus. Instead, they 
rely on students, who may be 
facing the most difficult time 
in their lives. And if cost must 
be added, could the nones-
sential fees at least be taken 
away? For instance, Bio 173, 
an introductory biology lab 
class, requires students to pay 
$45 for laboratory supplies. 
However, if I am not going to 
be in a lab, where is my money 
going, if not toward my own 
learning? 

Paying extra only to have 

been followed by canceled 
classes for a week seems 
ludicrous. While I sincerely 
appreciate the efforts of the 
Graduate Employees Organi-
zation in terms of fighting for 
a safer environment for both 
students and staff, I wish the 
administration was capable 
enough 
of 
controlling 
the 

situation at hand so it didn’t 
have to reach a point where 
education had to have been 
disrupted. The reaction to 
efforts calling for the right to 
work remotely, vigorous plans 
for testing and preventing the 
spread of COVID-19 was met 
with a lawsuit, an action that 
screams louder than words. 
South Quad currently has 13 
positive cases of COVID-19, 
and cases are confirmed in 
most other dorms: Bursley, 
Couzens, West Quad, North 
Quad and so on. Nonetheless, 
college proceeds to go on in-
person and this shows me that 
my money is valued more than 
I am. As a freshman who spent 
the entire senior year of high 
school looking forward to 
attending the university, this 
is deplorable. If the proper 
protocol was enacted when 
the numbers were low per-
haps the number of positive 
cases wouldn’t have gotten to 
this state. With the University 
creating more opportunities 
for students to get together, 
I wouldn’t be surprised if we 
lived tip-toeing on ice next 
year as well. At this point, I 
wouldn’t consider the Univer-
sity to be either leaders nor 
best, a reality all students are 
going to have to face if proper, 
serious precautions are not 
installed immediately.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

34 Only unanimous 

Baseball Hall of 

Americans 
have 
a 
large 

appetite for television shows 
about police, violent crime 
investigations, dramatic court 
hearings and life in prison. It 
seems like there are endless 
options of shows about these 
topics because the demand 
is so high. I am not exempt 
from this; personally, some 
of my favorites were Crimi-
nal Minds, Brooklyn 99 and 
Mindhunter. But this past 
summer amid protests against 
police brutality, I began to 
grapple with the harm that 
has been caused by the mas-
sive wave of crime television 
since the 1980s, despite my 
love for them.

With any piece of media 

you consume, one of the most 
important things you must 
remember is that what you are 
seeing is not reality. Shows 
such as Law & Order, CSI, and 
Chicago P.D. are written from 
a perspective that is not an 
accurate representation of the 
criminal justice system in the 
United States. These shows 
depict a world of police sav-
iors, fighting crime and chaos, 
saving us from criminals that 
would otherwise disrupt our 
properly functioning society. 
All they want to do is put away 
violent people and make the 
world a better place. But this 
is a lie.

Most police shows are dis-

honest about the amount of 
corruption and brutality that 
officers bring into communi-
ties. They normalize a sys-
tem that is inherently racist 
and violent, with origins as 
slave patrols and current ties 
to white supremacist orga-
nizations. The ‘good cops’ 
who save the day at the end 
of every episode are not who 

most Black Americans see 
when we are stopped by the 
police. Those were not the 
cops that killed Breonna Tay-
lor, George Floyd or Aiyana 
Stanley Jones. The indoctri-
nating images of superhero 
police departments make it 
easier for Americans to call 
violent cops ‘bad’ apples, but 
in reality, police departments 
in the United States kill civil-
ians at much higher rates than 
other wealthy countries such 
as Canada and Australia.

Not only do these television 

shows inaccurately depict the 
police, they also perpetuate 
harmful myths about people of 
color in marginalized neigh-
borhoods. 
Entertainment 

media often overrepresents 
violent crime and Black and 
Brown suspects, compared to 
white-collar crime and White 
suspects. 
These 
narratives 

gloss over the effects of white 
supremacy and lack of access 
as a result of institutionalized 
and systemic racism and capi-
talism that have legitimized 
these communities as “crime-
ridden.” 

Beyond 
perceptions 
of 

policing within communities 
of color, the media’s portray-
als of the prison industrial 
complex, and the workers 
within it, contribute to the 
widespread 
acceptance 
of 

mass incarceration and police 
brutality in the U.S. For exam-
ple, in nearly every episode of 
the fifteen season television 
series, Criminal Minds, FBI 
agents who specialize in high-
level crimes committed by 
serial criminals are presented 
with a case that they need to 
solve. The episode structure 
is usually the same: the team 
arrives at the scene, and soon 
another crime is committed 
by the same person so they 
feel the pressure to find the 
suspect before someone else 

is harmed. This indicates that 
if the FBI weren’t working 
around the clock to find them, 
more crime occurs. Viewers 
watching continue to believe 
that they need more police 
officers and federal agents 
in their town to keep them 
safe, even though the crimes 
depicted in the media are sig-
nificantly less severe than the 
survival crimes committed in 
said neighborhoods — such as 
food theft as a survival tactic, 
which the system causes by 
keeping civilians from these 
resources in the first place.

In addition to the desire to 

have more policing, we begin 
to accept police brutality as 
part of the job to ensure the 
safety of others. In one epi-
sode of Criminal Minds, an 
unarmed man who is suspect-
ed of sexual assault is shot and 
killed by an agent after he is 
released 
from 
questioning. 

The agent lies and says she 
killed him in self-defense. We 
are left to empathize with the 
FBI agent because his murder 
is better than the possibility 
of him committing another 
crime. We have to deconstruct 
this way of thinking. Why is 
execution the only way we can 
keep communities safe? We 
must also recognize that no 
matter how law enforcement 
feels about individuals they 
interact with, they should 
not have the power to be the 
judge, jury and executioner. 
If they can justify violence 
against that man, they can do 
the same against anyone. 

In addition to media affect-

ing society’s attitudes about 
how police officers should 
treat 
citizens, 
they 
also 

impact why we think we need 
police officers in the first 
place. In her New York Times 
article, “Yes, We Mean Liter-
ally Abolish the Police,” Mari-
ame Kaba reminds us that the 

police don’t do what most peo-
ple think they do. The average 
police officer only makes one 
felony arrest in a year. Most 
of their time is spent respond-
ing to noncriminal issues. The 
media portrayals of communi-
ties full of violence and cops 
running to the rescue and 
directly restoring the peace 
have contributed to the sup-
port of harsher policing on the 
streets and more prisons in 
urban areas when there isn’t 
any need. In fact, these shows 
fail to display the consequen-
tial harm that police bring 
into Black communities such 
as extreme violence, family 
separation, mental and physi-
cal abuse, school to prison 
pipelines and so on.

I’m not saying everyone has 

to stop watching any televi-
sion show or film that features 
police or detectives because 
that 
would 
be 
essentially 

impossible. But I implore you 
to understand the vast differ-
ences between what is depict-
ed on the screen versus the 
reality of the PIC and what 
Black Americans experience 
daily. Remember that media 
industries are capitalizing on 
and reinforcing a system that 
has been harming the image 
and lives of Black and Brown 
people for decades. As some-
one who believes in the abo-
lition of the PIC as a whole, 
I know how powerful a tool 
imagination is. We must be 
able to reimagine a world in 
which police and prisons do 
not exist because they are 
not needed. We could create 
a world where community 
members care for each other 
and police budgets are redis-
tributed into social programs. 
We have to understand the 
realities within our own com-
munities instead of relying 
on crime television to tell us 
about our own communities.

“As a freshman who spent the

looking forward to attending the

Wednesday, September 30, 2020 — 7
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

7500 miles from our native 

Ann Arbor campus lies the 
Pakistani city of Karachi, a 
metropolis renowned for its 
linguistic, ethnic and reli-
gious diversity. Just 750 miles 
from Karachi exists Lahore, 
the next largest Pakistani city 
notable for its social liberal-
ism, high level of educational 
quality and literary works. 
Despite these positive quali-
ties, for years, sexual assault 
has not recieved the enforce-
ment nor the attention it 
requires in these Pakistani 
cities –– until now. 

On Friday, Sept. 4, a 5-year-

old girl named Marwah was 
kidnapped from a local shop, 
sexually assaulted, hit on the 
head and then set alight, ulti-
mately left in a heap of gar-
bage found two days later. In 
a similarly unfortunate inci-
dent, this past Wednesday, 
Sept. 9, a woman, roughly in 
her 30s, was dragged from her 
vehicle which was stopped on 
the highway, held at gunpoint, 
attacked, robbed and sexually 
assaulted multiple times in 
front of her two young chil-
dren. The two separate inci-
dents have sparked immense 
protesting across Pakistan, 
focusing attention on the con-
spicuous, toxic rape culture 
and years of government inac-
tion.

In the wake of these recent 

sexual assaults, the Lahore 
police chief, Muhammad Umar 
Sheikh, added fuel to the fire 
across the greater community 
––asking why the woman had 
not checked whether she had 
enough gas before embarking 
on her journey and why she 
had been traveling so late at 
night without an adult male 
accompanying 
her. 
While 

already enraged, Pakistanis 
now rage, utilizing Sheikh’s 
words as an example of what 
is widely considered charac-

teristic of Pakistani officials’ 
negligence 
toward 
sexual 

assault and a deeply embedded 
masculinity within Pakistani 
culture.

The protests in Pakistan 

along with the allegations lev-
eled by the Twitter account 
“Assaulters at UMich” this 
past 
summer 
prompt 
the 

question –– what is the link 
between masculinity and rape 
culture across two seeming-
ly unconnected parts of the 
globe?

Rape culture is perpetuated 

immensely by gender norms 
which men and women con-
tinue to validate, from objecti-
fying women to viewing them 
as sexual objects, all justified 
through phrases like “boys 
will be boys” in both munici-
pal areas.

However, 
more 
subtle 

microaggressions, like victim-
blaming such as in the recent 
cases in Pakistan, are at most 
to blame for minimizing the 
real impacts of sexual assault. 
Devalidating the survivor’s 
story in spite of overwhelming 
evidence instead of condemn-
ing the actions of the perpetra-
tor has become commonplace. 
This must be reversed in order 
to begin addressing the notion 
of justice for survivors. 

While it is very important 

to acknowledge and address 
sexual assault against male 
survivors, the onus is primar-
ily on men, who most directly 
wield the benefits of the patri-
archy and thus have most 
contributed to rape culture, 
to confront their own values, 
beliefs and behaviors, and 
address those of other men, 
particularly when it comes to 
sexual attitudes. University 
policies must focus on edu-
cating men as the primary 
method to reducing trends 
of sexual assault on campus-
es. When we analyze events 
internationally, we must be 
willing to use the same lens 
to understand, acknowledge 
and rectify similar patterns 

The Arab diaspora is one of 

the most widespread diaspo-
ras in the world — there are 
20 million Arab immigrants 
living in nearly every corner 
of the globe. With such a large 
immigrant population, the Mid-
dle East/North Africa region 
has proportionally more citi-
zens in its diaspora than most 
regions. Regardless of the dis-
tance between people of Arab 
descent, they face a common 
struggle: the struggle to retain 
their cultural identity and pre-
serve their heritage while living 
among non-Arabs. 

This struggle is especially 

prevalent in the lives of Aus-
tralian siblings Rahma (17) and 
Adam (20) Elatrebi Soliman and 
their close friend who is practi-
cally family, Aisha Sellami (19). 
This Australian trio has cre-
ated the clothing brand, Soliela, 
which serves to unite all mem-
bers of the Arab diaspora and 
preserve the culture so many 
struggle to keep alive. Rahma 
and Adam are both of Egyptian 
descent and Aisha is of both 
Egyptian and Algerian descent. 
As the children of Arab immi-
grants living in a Western coun-
try, Rahma, Adam and Aisha 
have experienced the identity 
struggle many in the Arab dias-
pora face first hand.

I recently sat down (virtu-

ally) with creatives Aisha and 
Rahma to discuss the origins of 
their innovative clothing brand, 
their 
accomplishments 
with 

Soliela thus far and future goals 
they have for the brand. Here’s 
what they had to say about 
Soliela:

The Unconventional Start 

to Soliela

Aisha, Adam and Rahma 

have been interested in fashion 
and, more broadly, art for their 
entire lives. Rahma recalls her 
and Aisha growing up constant-
ly going to op shops (the Austra-
lian equivalent of thrift stores) 
where they were inspired by 
the generations of designs that 
existed in one setting. Through 
the op shops, Rahma says they 
were exposed to so much fash-
ion, and they began to appre-
ciate everyone’s unique style. 
Rahma expands on this saying, 
“Going to these op shops every-

day of my life, you get exposed 
to so much, and you’re able to 
appreciate what a grandma’s 
wearing and also what a home-
less person is wearing.” The 
non-mainstream 
styles 
that 

inspired Rahma and Aisha in 
their childhood are reflected 
in the uniqueness and objective 
beauty of their clothing designs.

In addition to their expo-

sure to art since youth, Rahma 
and Adam had wanted to make 
a brand for ages. In particular, 
through their visits to Egypt, 
they became obsessed with 
Egyptian fashion and the high-
ly regarded Egyptian cotton. 
Notably, Rahma and Adam were 
shocked to find that there was 
barely any Egyptian cotton in 
Egypt. This ironic scarcity of 
Egyptian cotton lingered in the 
back of their minds and would 
soon reappear with the creation 
of their brand as they focused 
mainly on using Egyptian cot-
ton for their pieces.

As for the actual creation of 

the brand, it was sparked by 
an unexpected event in which 
Rahma and Adam had to com-
bine their creative forces in 
order to sustain themselves 
while their mother was visiting 
Egypt. The story goes as such: 
Around four years ago Rahma 
and Adam’s mother went on a 
trip to Egypt and left them with 
enough money for the duration 
of her stay. When their mother’s 
trip was unfortunately extend-
ed due to the death of a family 
member in Egypt, Rahma and 
Adam ran out of money but did 
not want to stress their mother 
out anymore than she already 
was. Instead, they innovatively 
designed a T-shirt with the 
name “Soliela” on it (which pre-
viously was Adam’s instagram 
handle) and sold it to people in 
their school. This idea was a 
great hit as they profted around 
$2,000 from pre-orders alone. 
Due to the shocking success of 
their shirts, Rahma and Adam 
decided to turn their idea to 
an actual business, and thus, 
Soliela was born.

The Theme of Duality
As mentioned before, Soliela 

served to represent the dual 
essence of being of Arab descent 
and living in a non-Arab coun-
try. This representation is pri-
marily present in the derivation 
of the brand name. The first 
part of the brand name, “Soli,” 

is derived from the English 
spelling of Rahma and Adam’s 
last name, Soliman. The second 
half of the name “ela” is derived 
from the Egyptian street slang 
for the word boy, “يلا” (pro-
nounced, yela). The second half 
of the name also doubles as a 
reference to the other part of 
Rahma and Adam’s last name, 
Elatrebi. With these English 
and Arabic elements combined, 
the name of this brand is a per-
fect reflection of the purpose of 
Soliela as well as who the brand 
primarily caters to: Arabs living 

outside of the Middle East and 
North Africa.

The above photo is a design 

made by Aisha that references 
the duality of the brand name 
and 
purpose. 
This 
graphic 

includes different ways the 
brand can be written — fully 
in English as shown at the top, 
fully in Arabic as shown at the 
bottom of the graphic and a mix 
of the two as shown in the mid-
dle. The middle format is the 
main logo used for the brand.

Intended Audience
While it is clear that the main 

audience of the brand is mem-
bers of the Arab diaspora, Aisha 
explains that it is not exclu-
sively a brand for people of Arab 
descent. She expands on their 
audience with two categories: 
a primary audience and a sec-
ondary audience. The primary 
audience of their brand is Arabs 
— they are the people who the 
brand is for and about. Aisha 
says the ideal person wearing 
the brand is “that Arab kid liv-
ing in France who eats couscous 
at home and wears those coats 
and, I don’t know, steals cars at 
night and is stuck in between 
and is stuck growing up and 
that is who we want wearing 
the clothes. For that comfort on 
their journey.” Additionally, the 
secondary audience would be 
non-Arab people who enjoy the 
designs of the brand. For the 
secondary audience, the brand 
would become a way to change 
the narrative that Arabs are 
lucky to be in a Western coun-
try and that their home coun-
tries are rubbish. They want to 
change that narrative and dis-
play the beauty of the culture.

The Intersection of Fash-

ion and Politics

Similar to the unification 

of the Arab diaspora and the 
dual essence of the brand, 
Soliela 
frequently 
embodies 

the intersection of politics and 
fashion. They have released 
various pieces dedicated to cer-
tain political issues, figures and 
causes. 

Most 
recently, 
Soliela 

dropped a winter scarf with 
the traditional Palestinian kef-
fiyeh pattern. All proceeds 
from this scarf were donated 
to the Olive Kids foundation. 
On an Instagram post about 
this piece, Soliela wrote, “Due 
to what has been going on in 
Palestine for the past 72 years 
and the Annexation of Pales-
tine that will be taking place 
on the 1st of July 2020, we have 
decided to drop a winter scarf, 
with the Keffiyeh pattern. This 
traditional pattern worn by 

Palestinian farmers became a 
symbol of the Palestinian resis-
tance movement. 100% of the 
proceeds will be donated to @
olivekids, an Australian reg-
istered foundation that seeks 
to facilitate financial support, 
educational and medical assis-
tance to Palestinian children.” 
The scarf was a major success 
for Soliela, as it sold out in less 
than an hour with customers 
from all over the world. Below 

is a photo from their campaign 
for the Keffiyeh designed scarf:

In addition to using fashion to 

assist Arab countries suffering 
at the hands of Western forces, 
such as in the case of Palestine, 
Soliela also creates clothing to 
help alleviate issues between 
Arab countries. Most recently, 
Soliela released a graphic on 
their Instagram that depicts 
an animated soccer ball in the 
northern region of Africa. This 
graphic resembles the love of 
soccer throughout the Middle 
East and North Africa which is 
one thing that unites the North 
African countries Algeria and 
Egypt. Soliela creative Aisha 
intentionally incorporated soc-
cer into this design to reflect 
and encourage the unification 
of MENA countries. She con-
demns division and conflict 
between any Arab countries 
and chooses to embrace the 
similarities of the Arab world. 

The graphic for this cause is 
shown below:

The Future of Soliela
With all Rahma, Adam and 

Aisha have accomplished so far 
with their brand, they are still 
only in the early stages. Rahma 
hopes that after she graduates 
high school she will have more 
time and can put more effort 
into the brand, which will allow 
them to start releasing more 
consistent, larger clothing lines. 
In addition, Soliela creators 
hope to expand their brand 
beyond clothing and explore the 
world of design further.

Aside from the above men-

tioned goals, they have no spe-
cific vision for the future other 
than to have the brand be a con-
stant reflection of their ideas 
and creative growth. Rahma, 
Adam and Aisha hope that along 
the way, the reinforcement of 
Arab culture through Soliela 
will normalize Arabs loving

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

Look after your emotional needs 
with some self-indulgence. Your 
favorite treats will help mitigate 
the visceral onslaught of the Aries 
Full Moon, which might otherwise 

find you struggling to 
comprehend your place 
in the world.

AQUARIUS

GEMENI

Socially, there could be 
disappointments this week, and 
you may feel particularly angry 
with a friend. With Venus arriving 
in your family zone, it’s a good 

idea to back away from 
social events for a few 
days to regain your 
bearings at home.
 

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

A crisis at work puts you on the 
spot, but you’ll feel surprisingly 
confident in the limelight once 
you’re forced into it. Venus gives 
you extra charm and persuasive 

power, so you should 
find it relatively easy to 
lead from the front.

TAURUS

Venus’ arrival in your dating zone 
is fantastic news if you’re looking 
for love. However, the Full Moon 
warns against pretending to be 
something you’re not. Go for 

honesty and frankness. 
Be yourself, because you 
have so much to offer.

VIRGO

PISCES

LIBRA
LEO

Venus arrives in your money zone, 
which can lead to extravagant 
spending, especially since you’re 
fond of a touch of luxury at all 
times. Be careful with your 

budget, though, because 
going into debt now 
could be painful later.

Venus’ arrival in Virgo boosts your 
confidence no end and puts you in 
a great position for dating, job 
interviews, or any situation where 
you need to shine. It’s an intensely 

emotional Full Moon for 

some, but keep looking 
on the positive side.

The Full Moon shines from your 
love zone, so there could be a 
drama in your closest relationship. 
Relinquish the need to win; 
instead, try to remember that 

you’re both on the same 

side. Venus encourages 
you to spend plenty of 
time alone together.

Friendships are in the spotlight as 
Venus changes signs, and you can 
expect to find a great deal in 
common with new people this 
week. However, the Full Moon 

energies eat into your free 

time, so be prepared to be 

patient and flexible.

Venus moves into your career 
zone this week, helping you get 
ahead with the consent and 
approval of others. The Full Moon 
shines from your risk zone, 

however, so you’ll need 

to curb your impulsive 

edge a little. Step 
back from the brink

If you’re looking for love, look 
widely – there are hints of a 
foreign connection here with 
Venus moving into your travel 
zone. Meanwhile, the Full Moon 

illuminates a difficult 

family situation – 

where there’s a will to 
resolve it, there’s a 
way.

Venus fires up your passion zone 
now, but that means jealousy is 
also a factor. Try to give your 
sweetheart the same level of 
freedom you demand from them. 

There are issues of trust 

here, but better 
communication, aided 
by Venus, will help.

Venus arrives in your love zone, 
bringing sweet romance, gentle 
togetherness and a lot of 
companionship. The Full Moon is 
all about whether or not you have 
lived up to your values, but it 

seems that you have – 
so get set for a week of 
bliss.


Opinion

T

hough it is good that 
social 
media 
sites, 

particularly 
Twitter, 

are finally working to prevent the 
rampant spread of misinformation 
on their platforms, this alone is 
not enough. These fact-checking 
provisions are limited in scope, and 
thus do not absolve social media 
users of responsibility for verifying 
that content they consume or amplify 
is factually accurate, especially when 
it relates to topics as paramount as 
the upcoming election.

First, it is important for social 

media users to understand the 
limited reach of Twitter and 
Facebook’s new social media fact-
checking policies, both in terms of 
the types of posts they cover and 
the impact they have on online 
discourse. Even Twitter, the most 
proactive social media network with 
regard to misinformation, only flags 
and censors a small portion of false 
political claims, specifically ones 
that violate its “civic integrity policy.” 
This policy only covers tweets which 
are aimed at “manipulating or 
interfering in elections or other civic 
processes,” and does not extend to 
general political falsehoods. 

This is why only a small 

subsection of Trump’s lies, including 
his assertion that mail-in voting is 
inherently fraudulent, are flagged, 
while the vast majority, such as 
his oft-repeated claim that the 
U.S. only has the most COVID-
19 cases in the world because of 
the nation’s widespread testing, 
remain on Twitter unimpeded. In 
practical terms, this means that the 
vast majority of false or misleading 
tweets 
go 
unflagged, 
severely 

limiting the impact that Twitter’s 
fact-checking procedures have on 
Trump. Considering that, the onus 
is still largely on Twitter users to 
think critically, and they cannot rely 
on Twitter’s narrow fact-checking 
policies to do that for them. 

It is important to consider how 

much of an impact Twitter’s fact-
checking policies actually have on 
online political discourse. With 
regard to Trump in particular, 
Twitter’s efforts to call out his 

political falsehoods have only a 
marginal impact — at best — on 
the national political conversation, 
for several reasons. First, even on 
tweets that Twitter flagged as false 
and provided fact-checking for, 
Trump still received a large number 
of reactions, indicating that his 
opinions were still widely shared 
and publicized. For instance, his 
tweet declaring that mail-in voting 
could not be “anything less than 
substantially fraudulent” has more 
than 35,000 retweets and 125,000 
likes as of Sept. 27. 

In tandem with that, fact-

checking Trump’s blatant falsehoods 
do little to actually regulate the 
political climate. People who do not 
support Trump already know that 
many of his claims are false, while his 
supporters are exceedingly unlikely 
to change their views based on fact-
checking, especially provided by a site 
that Trump claims is biased against 
Republicans. 
Ultimately, 
while 

Twitter’s fact-checking policies help 
improve political discourse and call 
out falsehoods in theory, their impact 
on the president’s social media 
presence is effectively null. 

While Twitter’s approach to 

Trump has been widely discussed, 
less-publicized causes and groups 
can still easily manipulate Twitter 
users, providing a reminder that 
the 
responsibility 
for 
verifying 

information found on the site still 
resides with the users themselves. 
The Black Lives Matter Foundation 
in Santa Clarita, Calif., supports 
bridging the silos between the local 
community and the police. However, 
the foundation’s misnomer led people 
to believe it was associated with 
the Black Lives Matter movement, 
which was founded to end violence 
against Black communities. 

As a result, many looking to 

financially aid the social justice 
movement 
donated, 
or 
almost 

donated, to the Santa Clarita 
foundation: According to Buzzfeed 
News, Apple, Google and Microsoft 
almost donated a combined $4 
million to the foundation in the wake 
of George Floyd’s murder before 
realizing that they almost donated 

to a foundation that encourages 
communities’ 
relationship 
with 

the 
police 
— 
which 
directly 

contradicts the Black Lives Matter 
movement’s call to defund the 
police. This case highlights how 
while misinformation is a problem, 
an unwillingness to fact check or 
research claims contributes to how 
people uncritically take information 
at face value. Major corporations, like 
Apple, have the resources to look into 
the foundations they associate with. 
However, their failure to do research 
before nearly making a multimillion-
dollar donation suggests that failing 
to investigate or verify things 
sourced from Twitter is common not 
only among social media users but 
the populace at large. 

Major social media platforms 

indicate their focus is primarily 
on aiding the spread of factual 
information, 
as 
demonstrated 

through mission statements and 
corporate 
social 
responsibility 

initiatives. For example, in 2018, 
Twitter 
supported 
Reporters 

Without Borders and celebrated 
World Press Freedom Day with 
multilingual hashtags and global 
events. Events like this demonstrate 
Twitter’s focus on press freedom, 
an 
admirable 
initiative 
which 

occasionally is misconstrued as 
open dialogue without a focus 
on 
fact-checking 
and 
ensuring 

truthfulness. To emphasize that, 
on June 2, Twitter stated that its 
“focus is on providing context, not 
fact-checking,” a reminder that 
the website is first and foremost a 
conversational outlet. 

While Facebook has a third-party 

fact-checking program founded in 
2016, Twitter’s approach to handling 
misinformation shows that it is 
largely up to social media users 
to validate claims they see online. 
While this can come in many forms, 
such as cross-checking facts with 
those of other sources and seeking 
the opinion of reputable publications 
and 
journalists, 
recognizing 

dangerous misinformation ploys 
on social media is essential in 
ethical and productive news and 
information consumption.

F

or a recent Detroit Metro 
Times 
article, 
reporter 

Lee DeVito asked Rick 

Fitzgerald, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan spokesman, about an 
op-ed written by an anonymous U-M 
staff member. Fitzgerald’s response, 
which regarded an alleged conflict 
of interest with Regent Ron Weiser 
(R), came close to engaging the 
point that such conflicts of interest 
aren’t anything new. Fitzgerald, 
presumably 
unintentionally, 

focuses on what the University 
prioritizes: serving private wealth 
and preserving its reputation. The 
anonymous 
staffer 
writes 
that 

this is additionally symptomatic 
of nationwide “deterioration and 
rot,” which they believe descended 
upon us only in the past four years. 
However, 
there 
is 
significant 

evidence 
that 
this 
distinctly 

American cultural rot at an ostensibly 
“progressive” public University isn’t 
new, with institutional cowardice 
running rampant alongside it.

What then, might you ask, is the 

true culprit? The business model the 
University uses is not unique from 
the traditional college and university 
model. It is a patently corporate 
business model that discourages 
accountability from top to bottom. 
This dependence on private wealth 
actively privileges the interests of 
its wealthy donors over the well-
being of its students, vulnerable 
faculty, graduate student employees, 
adjuncts and other members of the 
community, with the University’s 
endowment driving these decisions. 
In service of its brand, the University 
prioritizes burying the smoking gun 
of imminent harm. Such political 
theater is ignited when one of 
its 
administrators, 
a 
powerful 

member of its athletic department 
or a tenured faculty member, is 
implicated in wrongdoing.

The necessity of preserving the 

University’s lifestyle brand is the real 
reason we’ve only recently learned 
of the decades of preventable sexual 
misconduct and manipulation by 
former University Provost Martin 
Philbert. The logic is obvious when 
one looks more closely at the scandal: 
If a university is known to allow its 
tenured faculty members to sexually 
assault students with impunity, how 
does that affect its reputation? If it is 
known to use Title IX investigations 
as legal cover to protect itself from 
liability, how might that affect a 
parent’s decision to send their child 
to school there?

There is a term for this: 

institutional complicity. University 
leadership is protected from legal 
liability in most cases by qualified 
immunity laws and misbehaving 
faculty reported to OIE are protected 
by employment laws meant to 
safeguard their right to privacy. In 
other 
words, 
if 
OIE 
had 
hypothetically 

investigated Philbert at various 
points, it is incredibly unlikely they 
would have done anything to stop 
him. Smart criminals, unfortunately, 
don’t leave trails aside from their 
victims, and OIE has no incentive to 
look into those cases properly. OIE’s 
staff are paid by the University, and 
acknowledging a sexual predator’s 
presence, past or present, doesn’t 
serve the institution.

When reached for comment, 

Fitzgerald said he doesn’t believe 
these claims about the University’s 
transparency are accurate, citing the 
fact that “the University publishes 
annual reports on sexual misconduct 
matters that allow anyone to follow a 
case through to conclusion.”

In the years following the advent 

of the #MeToo movement, the 
entire University community was 
deceived into believing they were 

not capable of such crises. That’s 

not because a crisis didn’t exist, but 
because the University does what 
administrative offices have always 
done when faced with what the 
anonymous University staff member 
calls “unprofitable inevitabilities”: 
They gaslight individuals already 
victimized by the scandal, and then 
suppress the truth until they can no 
longer do so. That is, when the trail 
of harms becomes extensive and 
undeniable. 

With that in mind, the sexual 

misconduct cases of Philbert and 
former University physician Dr. 

Robert Anderson have much in 

common. Both men were exalted 
and protected by the institution 
even after their predatory behavior 
was brought to the attention of 
administrators. Both hid their 
malicious targeting of victims under 
the veneer of professionalism and 
preyed on their victims’ ambitions 
while exploiting a culture of silence. 
Knowing this, it is important to 

acknowledge that under institutional 
layers of negligence there were 
other bad actors who enabled 
predatory behavior. The truth was, 
as they say, hidden in plain sight — by 
administrators with ample reasons 
for doing so.

Philbert accuser Emily Renda told 

The Daily that “President Schlissel 
100% lied to the Michigan Daily 
when he told you that he first learned 
of any allegations against Philbert in 
January of this year.” 

Indeed, 
evidence 
uncovered 

during the WilmerHale investigation 
indicates Schlissel should have 
known — a survey he was charged 
with reviewing in advance of Philbert 
being appointed Provost described 
him as a “notorious sexual predator.” 

Additionally, another individual 

abused by Anderson, Tad DeLuca, 
reported his abuse to former 
University wrestling coach Bill 
Johannesen in 1975 — over 40 years 
ago. Not only was he disbelieved 
despite how Anderson’s serial abuse 
was an open secret, but he was kicked 
off the wrestling team. Anderson was 
allowed to continue his sexual abuse 
unabated. At Anderson’s funeral 
in 2008, football coach Lloyd Carr 
called him “a tremendous asset 
in this community.” When the 
University was made aware of the 
extent of the allegations, rather than 
opening an internal investigation, it 
passed them on to the University of 
Michigan Police Department and 
the Washtenaw County prosecutor’s 
office. 
The 
prosecutor 
quietly 

dismissed the charges, because 
Anderson was deceased and the 
statute of limitations had passed.

There is also the case of David 

Daniels, a disgraced opera singer 
and former School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance Professor. Daniels was 
fired one year after he and his 
husband were charged with sexually 
assaulting fellow singer and former 
SMTD graduate student Andrew 
Lipian. But in his civil suit against 
the University, Lipian alleges the 
University had known about his 
allegations for years and failed to 
act. Even in comments made by 
representatives for Daniels and 
the University after several other 
accusers came forward, the specter 
of a ruined reputation overshadows 
the importance of learning from 
institutional mistakes and ensuring 
the well-being of alleged victims.

It is important to note the 

University has other options. For 
example, it can allow Michigan 
Attorney General Dana Nessel 
to 
completely 
investigate 
any 

allegations. 
Knowing 
this, 
the 

University has refused to suspend 
attorney-client 
privilege 
or 
to 

commit to complete transparency, 
shutting down those possibilities in 
favor of taking measures to control 
the narrative.

Case workers for the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Sexual 
Assault 

Prevention and Awareness Center 
could direct survivors to OSCR’s 
much less formal Adaptable Conflict 
Resolution process rather than 
an OIE investigation in the case 
of reported sexual misconduct. 
In 
choosing 
the 
ACR 
route, 

survivors 
(or 
“complainants”) 

forego the possibility of sanctions 
or a guilty finding for the offender 
(or “respondent”). This is part 
of a defense strategy meant to 
protect the University and avoid 
liability traps, due to how imposing 
sanctions or punishment of any 
kind on the respondent (including 
a finding of policy violation) opens 
the University up to litigation. As a 
result, even in cases where a Title 
IX investigation results in a guilty 
finding, it behooves the University 
to impose sanctions on the offending 
party that can be considered 
inappropriately light.

With the current Title IX process 

being what it is, encouraging a survivor 
to endure a long and emotionally 
taxing investigation, with inadequate 
professional support provided by 
the school, might be thought of as 
an endangerment of the survivor’s 
well-being. While case managers at 
SAPAC are licensed professionals, 
the on-staff advocates often charged 
with supporting survivors through 
traumatic processes are trained 
interns, not licensed therapists nor 
trained legal professionals.

With regards to the allegation 

that the University’s Title IX Office 
is in place to protect the reputation 
of the University and not the 
members of its protected classes 
nor the members of its community, 
Fitzgerald 
replied, 
“That’s 
not 

accurate. 
The 
safety 
of 
our 

community is our highest priority.”

Fitzgerald additionally stated 

that “SAPAC advocates and all staff 
are trained in the empowerment 
philosophy approach, which has 
at its foundation the belief that 
survivors are the ones who know 
what they need best, and SAPAC 
advocates are available to help them 
understand all of their options and 
not make decisions for them. This is 
affirmed on the SAPAC website.” 

In the case of Claire*, a former 

SMTD student, the student she 
accused of sexual assault was found 
guilty after a lengthy investigation by 
OIE. However, once OIE concluded 
its 
investigation, 
responsibility 

for 
imposing 
sanctions 
or 

“punishment” was then passed 
to OSCR because the respondent 
in her case was another student. 
Other than the OSCR sanctioning 
board’s 
recommendation 
that 

the respondent seek counseling 
— noting they had taken into 
consideration his autism spectrum 
disorder diagnosis and suggested he 
disclose the finding appropriately 
in the future — the board’s only 
required sanctions were a monthly 
“educational project focused on 
building awareness” that could be 
“satisfied in a variety of formats, 
including 
outside 
professional 

providers,” in addition to a short 
reflection essay he was given six 
months to write. 

Claire 
says 
a 
permanent, 

no-contact directive OSCR gave 
the respondent was never enforced. 
Instead, she was forced to see him in 
class every day for her final two years 
in SMTD. Now enrolled in graduate 
school at another institution, she 
disclosed that she experienced panic 
attacks as a result of nearly constant 
exposure to her assailant after the 
investigation concluded. She added 
that she found SAPAC’s resources to 
be unhelpful.

In 
a 
letter 
containing 
the 

sanctions sent from OSCR to the 
respondent dated May 5, 2017, and 
copied to Claire, the sanctioning 
board wrote, “You are to write 
an essay of 1,200-1,500 words 
(size 12, Times New Roman font, 
standard margins) discussing your 
experience. Please reflect on the 
situation and how this experience 
has affected your personal, social 
and academic experience since the 
time of the incident.” 

While the letter from OSCR goes 

on to say the essay can’t be used to 
justify the respondent’s actions, I’m 
unsure what’s more concerning: 
how a school’s punishment for a 
finding of responsibility for sexual 
assault can be so light, to the point 
of amounting to no real punishment 
at all or that the University imposes 
such 
light 
punishment 
while 

proclaiming they want to prevent 
sexual misconduct from occurring. 
When potential offenders know they 
won’t be appropriately punished 
for their crimes even if they are 
found guilty — particularly faculty 
offenders who know very well how 
much the system is already stacked 
in their favor — why wouldn’t they 
exploit an opportunity? Despite all 
this, Claire could not sue the school 
due to how OIE’s investigation had 
run down the clock, on the window 
during which victims can file for 
their right to sue: 180 days from the 
date of the trigger incident.

Meanwhile, 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services continues 
to have long wait times and 
currently has one on-staff counselor 
specializing in the treatment of 
sexual assault and trauma, Danielle 
Zohrob, 
Psy.D. 
Rather 
than 

enacting change, the administration 
continues to speak publicly over 
those they’ve harmed.

With that said, the University 

community 
needs 
to 
talk 

about exploitation marketed as 
empowerment. Given the OIE’s 
process for adjudicating sexual 
misconduct — one that Philbert 
himself actively defended — and the 
administration’s initial decision to 
hire a defense firm that has listed 
among its clients the notorious 
sexual predators Jeffrey Epstein 
and Roman Polanski (a decision only 
changed later, after it met swift public 
backlash), it seems the University is 
good at cover ups. It is to the point that 
while rights for complainants in Title 
IX processes are being gutted, the 
University administration has placed 
a spin on this gutting reminiscent 
of a “right-to-work” advertisement 
campaign.

FROM THE DAILY

The dangers of social media, even in 

the age of fact checking

O

n June 23, Twitter censored President Donald Trump’s tweets by 
attaching warning labels on tweets, including one about protesters 
in Portland and another tweet which said, “There will never be 

an ‘Autonomous Zone’ in Washington, D.C., as long as I’m your President. 
If they try they will be met with serious force!” This move comes after 
Twitter flagged two of Trump’s tweets on May 27 for violating their 
misinformation policies. Twitter and Facebook began censoring posts or 
notifying viewers if they spread egregiously false information, particularly 
pertaining to voting procedures for the upcoming 2020 general election.


I

’m sure you’ve all heard by 
now, but the long-seated 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 

Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. She 
passed away on Sept. 18 and 
immediately reinvigorated a 
partisan conflict that’s been 
brewing for the past four years. 
Her body hadn’t even been 
cold, and people were already 
in an uproar about what the 
proceeding 
replacement 

would look like. Sentiments 
over former President Barack 
Obama’s 
appointee, 
Justice 

Merrick Garland, come to mind 
as the Republicans seek to fill 
the vacancy in the weeks before 
the election. I don’t really want 
to talk about that, though. 
I never expected Sen. Mitt 
Romney, R-Utah, to actually 
have any decency and follow 
through 
with 
his 
dissent, 

anyway. Politics is a game, after 
all, and the rest is just for show. 

I want to talk about what 

RBG means to many people. 
Her influence in American 
politics cannot be understated 
— a champion of women’s 
rights. I won’t try and take that 
away from her. But there are 
many instances where RBG has 
ruled in a fashion many would 
say to be, well, problematic. 
Her history isn’t clean. I’m not 
trying to urinate on the fresh 
grave of such a prolific figure. 
She’s not Margaret Thatcher, 
after all. I take contention 
with the unquestioning faith in 
the most iconic figures of the 
American left. Being unable to 
criticize 
such 
consequential 

figures is something I take 
contention with. Let’s take a 
holistic look at Ginsburg, her 
legacy and what it all means to 
me and many other people.

I’ll start with the good. It’s 

irrefutable she’s had a positive 
impact on women’s rights in 
this country. Ginsburg was 
one of nine women at Harvard 
Law when she enrolled in 1956, 
later transferring to Columbia 
to graduate in 1959. She was 
undoubtedly a trailblazer in 
this right and helped paved 
the way for many other women 
to follow suit. Soon after, 
RBG 
volunteered 
with 
the 

American Civil Liberties Union 
and co-founded the Women’s 
Rights Project which started 
her career as a champion of 
gender equality right out of 
the gate. The Women’s Rights 
Project went on to challenge 

bias in government, including 
things like treatment of men 
and women in the military 
and unequal treatment in state 
jurisdictions. 

On 
the 
bench 
in 
the 

Supreme Court, she ruled in 
favor of the rights of disabled 
Americans, arguing for the 
rights of two neurodivergent 
women that had been trapped 
in a psychiatric ward without 
their consent. Even in the 
dissenting opinion, RBG made 
her perspectives known and 
her stance clear. In 2007, the 
case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear 
Tire & Rubber Co. reiterated 
the rights of corporations to 
pay 
their 
workers 
unequal 

wages in equal positions. RBG 
wrote 
the 
dissent, 
reading 

on the bench (an uncommon 
practice) about her objections 
to the ruling and her aversion 
to the obvious sexism within it. 
“In our view, the court does not 
comprehend, or is indifferent 
to, the insidious way in which 
women can be victims of pay 
discrimination,” 
Ginsberg 

said in her dissenting opinion. 
Ginsburg’s 
fight 
for 
equal 

rights cannot be understated.

But with such a long and 

expansive 
career, 
there 
is 

always going to be some bad. 
RBG has had some speed 
bumps, and it would be foolish 
to completely ignore them. 
Many 
critics 
that 
actually 

have something to say, rather 
than vapid political squabbles, 
mention her record on things 
like criminal justice and tribal 
law. Her record has been 
less than consistent when it 
comes to the rights of felons. 
In Overton v. Bazezza (2003), 
she ruled in favor of a decision 
that upheld a Michigan prison’s 
right to bar visitation to those 
with instances of substance 
abuse. In Porter v. Nussle, she 
authored the majority opinion 
which determined “No action 
shall be brought with respect 
to prison conditions … until 
such administrative remedies 
as are available are exhausted” 
before trying to file for abuse in 
court. Doesn’t help much when 
the prison system is already 
labyrinthian and notoriously 
terrible in terms of prisoner 
rights and guard accountability. 

Another point of contention 

that 
many 
people 
like 

myself have with her is her 
controversial rulings regarding 

treaty rights and the rights 
of Indigenous peoples. City 
of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian 
Nation of New York (2005) is 
a sore thumb that sticks out 
in this regard. The Oneida 
Nation 
repurchased 
lands 

privately that were once part of 
their reservation and claimed 
sovereignty 
over 
the 
land 

following the purchase. RBG 
wrote the majority opinion 
that dismissed their claims. 
In addition to that, there’s 
United States v. Navajo Nation, 
(2003) 
where 
RBG 
struck 

down a whopping $600 million 
compensation 
following 
a 

breach of contract against the 
Navajo Nation. 

Don’t think I’m trying to play 

to the whim of the people who 
drag Ginsburg down for the 
hell of it, for political gain. I 
appreciate and understand the 
strides she’s made for gender 
equality 
across 
the 
board. 

However, I have objections 
to idolatry: RBG has been 
glorified as someone worthy 
of unequivocal praise and not 
worth examining further. I 
don’t think that’s helpful. I 
don’t think the answer to the 
conniving and slimy politicians 
that seek to engage in hypocrisy 
with an appointment so soon 
after Ginsburg’s death is to 
deify her. 

A problem I have with the 

American left is their eagerness 
to ignore their own flaws. 
In order to be stronger, and 
to accept nothing but what’s 
right, we need to be able to 
acknowledge the flaws in our 
most lauded figures. Ginsburg 
had her faults, and as people 
who strive for a better world we 
need to be able to recognize that 
and work toward something 
better, for something more 
satisfactory. I’m tired of this 
banal level of acceptance from 
our rulers in this country. 
Women achieving success is 
always cool, but the “#girlboss” 
attitude of ignoring injustice 
in favor of symbolic victory is 
nearly just as harmful as flat 
out ignoring our problems. 
Ginsburg did so much good, 
but she was by no means the 
end of what we should ask from 
justices. Never accept anything 
less than justice. It’s in the 
position’s title, right?

T

he COVID-19 pandemic 
has presented a unique and 
unprecedented 
challenge 

for economies across the globe as 
world leaders balance safeguarding 
public 
health 
with 
protecting 

workers and industries. Here in the 
United States, as we continue to 
respond to the ongoing threat posed 
by the coronavirus, our nation has 
suffered staggering economic losses. 
According to the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis, the U.S. economy shrank 
at an alarming annual rate of 32.9 
percent in the second quarter of 
2020 alone, setting a record for the 
steepest drop in history. 

While the coronavirus crisis 

has had widespread impacts on the 
entire U.S. economy, it has had an 
especially destructive impact on 
workers and jobs. Since COVID-19 
first prompted economic shutdowns 
in March, tens of millions of U.S. 
workers have sought unemployment 
aid for the first time. At the 

beginning of September, the U.S. 

Labor Department reported that 
almost 900,000 workers filed initial 
claims for unemployment benefits in 
one week alone. On the other hand, 
though the unemployment rate has 
recovered somewhat since it hit nearly 
15% in April, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics’ recent August jobs report 
signals that millions of workers still 
find themselves struggling due to the 
pandemic’s impact.

As a result of this staggering 

economic 
carnage, 
Congress 

and 
the 
federal 
government 

have implemented a number of 
expansionary measures that aim to 
prop up our damaged economy. Once 
businesses were forced to close as 
states shut down in March, Congress 
worked quickly to deliver aid to 
struggling Americans. In late March, 
President Donald Trump signed 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and 
Economic Security Act into law after 
Congress passed it with bipartisan 
support. 

The unprecedented CARES Act 

— which cost the federal government 
more than $2 trillion in total — served 
as a multi-pronged approach to help 
those affected by the pandemic. Soon 
after this act was signed into law, each 
American citizen with income less 
than $75,000 (or $150,000 for those 
filing jointly) received a generous 
$1,200 stimulus check along with 
an additional $500 for each child 
under 17 years old in the household. 
Meanwhile, the CARES Act led to 
the implementation of the Paycheck 
Protection Program, a beneficial 
effort that provided small businesses 
financial support to help them survive 
this crisis. Finally, in addition to 
stimulus checks and support for small 
businesses as part of the CARES Act, 
the federal government also provided 
enhanced unemployment benefits of 
$600 per week, which unemployed 
American 
citizens 
received 
in 

addition to state aid.

The CARES Act was truly a 

remarkable 
effort 
that 
quickly 

distributed 
benefits 
across 
the 

nation in a time of distress and 
severe economic instability. But in 
retrospect, the Act was far from 
perfect. Though the CARES Act 
was successful in many ways, our 
lawmakers designed this legislation 
more broadly in order to distribute 
this crucial economic aid as quickly 
as possible. The broad targeting of 
this stimulus plan led to obvious 
waste and inefficiency. In terms 
of the stimulus checks, our federal 
government distributed benefits to 
all Americans under a certain level of 
income, even if some of these people 
never lost their jobs. Meanwhile, it 
is highly evident that the PPP was 
misused and taken advantage of by 
a large number of businesses, with 
the Wall Street Journal reporting 
that “the program’s $521 billion in 
loans ... went to well-heeled and 
politically connected firms across 
the economy, including law offices, 
charities, restaurant chains and 

wealth managers.” 

At the time the original CARES 

Act was passed in March, it seemed 
hard to imagine that further stimulus 
efforts might be necessary. Six months 
later, however, while our government 
has already spent trillions of dollars 
and helped millions of Americans, the 
coronavirus pandemic shows no signs 
of letting up anytime soon, with our 
country’s top health experts warning 
that the COVID-19 crisis is far from 
over. The ongoing threat posed by 
the pandemic has therefore reignited 
debates over further stimulus efforts, 
though the negotiations in Congress 
have appeared to stall for the time 
being.

It’s painfully obvious at this point 

that the coronavirus will continue 
to threaten the American economy 
until an effective therapeutic or 
vaccine is made available to the public. 
Until then, it is incumbent on our 
lawmakers and government officials 
to 
implement 
further 
stimulus 

measures that fight the economic 
impacts of COVID-19. However, while 
future stimulus bills are necessary, we 
must learn from the shortcomings 
of the CARES Act and make new 
stimulus money more narrowly 
targeted to those affected most. 
Unlike in March, we have the tools 
today to better understand who is 
most impacted by COVID-19 and the 
time to actually implement a strategy 
that is more narrowly targeted. 

A more narrow strategy to uplift 

struggling Americans would not only 
be a more efficient plan but would be 
a smarter plan. Instead of wastefully 
trying to distribute benefits to every 
American, as was the case with the 
CARES Act, narrow targeting of 
stimulus benefits would enable us to 
focus on those who need help most.

Future stimulus efforts must be more 

narrowly targeted 

EVAN STERN | COLUMNIST

A

t 87 years old, Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg lost 
her battle to cancer. As I 

type the word “battle,” it could 
not feel more appropriate, as 
Ginsburg truly was a warrior who 
fought far beyond the physical 
obstacles of cancer. We must 
now all find this warrior within 
us, for R.B.G. and everything she 
represented. I personally plan to 
wear an invisible collar, bun and 
glasses as my sword, shield and 
compass for the rest of my life. 

For millions of people across 

the world, Ginsburg’s death 
provoked many tears, anxieties 
and a collective call to action. 
The moment my phone vibrated 
and I read the headline: “Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg dead at 
87,” I was overwhelmed with 
emotion. First and foremost, 
I felt a deep sadness. As for 
many women, R.B.G. has been a 
lifelong role model for me. As a 
Jewish woman myself, Ginsburg 
has shown me how to shatter the 
glass ceiling I’ve been reminded 
of far too many times. Separate 
from 
any 
political 
ideology, 

Ginsburg should be remembered 
as a trailblazing force of nature. 

Whether you are politically 

aligned with R.B.G. or not holds 
no relevance; she was and is a true 
embodiment of what the Supreme 
Court should be, representative 
of the trust and passion we 
all yearn to see from our 
government officials. Ginsburg 
fought 
for 
and 
represented 

equality. 
Candid 
about 
the 

challenges she faced, Ginsburg 
provides 
encouragement 
to 

women everywhere: “I struck 

out on three grounds — I 

was Jewish, a woman and a 
mother.” 
Nonetheless, 
her 

accomplishments extend beyond 
the word limits of my column. To 
detail 87 years of her dedication, 
determination and dissent on 

one page would be impossible in 
trying to fully encapsulate the 
unbelievable contribution she 
has made to our country. 

Having 
said 
that, 
a 
few 

highlights 
should 
still 
be 

recognized. Ginsburg was a 
Jewish woman from Brooklyn, 
N.Y. Beyond graduating first 
in her mostly-male Columbia 
Law School class, she was the 
second female law professor at 
Rutgers University, a co-founder 
of the American Civil Liberties 
Union Women’s Rights Project, 
the second woman appointed 
to the Supreme Court, the 
first Supreme Court justice to 
officiate a same-sex marriage 
and a champion of equality for 
all: women, Black Americans, the 
Jewish community, the LGBTQ+ 
community, working mothers 
and, genuinely, so many more. 

Though I would argue that 

we would have never been ready 
for Ginsburg to leave us, it goes 
without saying that her passing 
comes at a scary time in history. 
As the pandemic continues on 
and the election looms closer, I 
couldn’t help but wonder just a 
few moments after the tears had 
stopped: What does this mean 
for the United States? Depending 
on your perspective, the world 
is either upside down or just 
starting to turn right side up. 
Regardless, it is essential that 
the memory, legacy and work of 
Ginsburg is not undone by her 
replacement on the Supreme 
Court. 

Before 
her 
death, 
Justice 

Ginsburg 
relayed 
her 
final 

demand to her granddaughter, 
Clara Spera: “My most fervent 
wish is that I will not be 
replaced until a new president 
is installed.” On Sept. 22, just 
four days after R.B.G’s passing, 
President Donald Trump said he 
will announce his nomination 

for the Supreme Court Justice on 
Saturday, Sept. 26. It goes without 
saying that this announcement 
has incited a lot of backlash; like 
seemingly everything in this day 
and age, there has been a divisive 
split between those who believe 
the president should nominate a 
lame-duck replacement in what 
could be the final months of his 
presidency and those who do not. 

When a woman who did 

so much for our country and 
asked for nothing in return 
has a final wish, you obey that 
wish. Think past the politics of 
a judicial majority — dig down 
to the most human, empathetic 
part of yourself. The justice that 
replaces Ginsburg must be one 
equipped to carry her torch. 
R.B.G. is indisputably one-of-
a-kind and nobody will ever be 
as “notorious.” However, this 
replacement should be similar to 
Ginsburg in more ways than just 
her gender. 

Feeling hopeless and helpless 

is natural in the wake of this 
monumental loss. I encourage 
every woman to do the following, 
no matter who you’re voting 
for this November. Think of 
Ginsburg as you sign your own 
mortgage or open your own bank 
account. Feel her with you every 
day you work as a woman, and 
even more so if you are pregnant 
or a mother. Support local 
women running for elections. 
Volunteer 
in 
mentorship 

programs for young girls, or get 
involved in your community 
through whatever avenue you 
are passionate about. 

Supreme Court Justice Ruth 

Bader Ginsburg may be gone, 
but it is now our responsibility to 
continue the ferocious, unrelenting 
spirit of the Notorious R.B.G.

I

f I asked you what are cars 
for, there are a few answers I 
might expect you to give me. 

Cars expand our horizons by letting 
us travel farther. They save time by 
letting us travel faster. Or, maybe you 
would simply say that we need cars: 
We need them to get to our places of 
work, to get to the store and buy food, 
to visit our families — in short, to live 
our lives.

If cars really are such a 

fundamental 
component 
of 

our daily lives, perhaps it is 
better to ask why we need 
them so badly in the first place. 
Because, despite their ubiquity 
in 
American 
society, 
cars 

inflict too much misery, death 
and destruction on us and our 
world to justify any of those 
benefits. 

The easiest way to examine 

the toll the automobile has taken 
on humanity is by looking at the 
staggering number of people killed 
by vehicles. Over the last few 
decades, the number of accidents 
per year in the United States has held 
remarkably steady, and although the 
actual number of deaths has declined 
slightly, it remains concerningly 
high. In 2018, the U.S. Department 

of Transportation reported 36,650 
total fatalities in 33,654 fatal 
vehicle accidents. In the 24 years 
from 1994 to 2018, a total of 973,698 
Americans died in car crashes.

These statistics are indisputably 

horrifying, but what might not 

seem as obvious is that cars 

themselves aren’t actually at fault. 
After all, cars are operated by 
people and people are prone to 
error. Car accident deaths can be 

mitigated by improving safety 

features and traffic laws — and 
in fact, much of the decline in 
deaths shown in the Department 
of Transportation statistics can 
likely be attributed to these 
improvements. No matter how 
much seatbelt or airbag technology 
improves, these features can only 
attempt to offset the inherent 
danger of letting millions of people 
zip around in two-ton missiles as 
a matter of daily routine. A future 
in which vehicle safety features 
prevent even close to 100% of 
deaths is a long way off.

Even if the threat of accidents 

were somehow entirely eliminated 
— maybe through self-driving 
technology — cars present other 
dangers to humanity and the 
environment. The Environmental 
Protection 
Agency 
estimates 

transportation accounted for 28% 
of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 
2018, and 82% of those emissions were 
made by cars and trucks. Though it’s 

much harder to precisely assess the 
damage these emissions have caused, 
both to people’s respiratory health 
and the environment, this damage is 
indisputable.

In a world where fatal pile ups 

on the highway are reported on the 
nightly news with the same accepting 
nonchalance as the day’s weather, car 
crashes are old news. Besides, isn’t it 
a simple enough thing to let advances 
in safety technology and renewable 
energy take their course and solve 
these problems in their own time? 
Maybe so. But if it were possible to 
drastically reduce or even eliminate 
our reliance on cars, these problems 
would never have to be solved, 
because they wouldn’t exist. And it is 
possible to do just that. 

It certainly wouldn’t be easy, 

but dispensing the need for mass 
ownership and use of automobiles 
via radical urban redesign would 
recondition all of the problems I have 
already mentioned, as well as several 
that cannot be solved simply by 
making cars better. For example, in 
an interview with WSP, Kit Chiu, an 
Advanced Mobility Systems Planner, 
stated, “If we want to turn the 
current increase in active transport 
usage 
into 
sustained 
change, 

planners, and all those who bring 
about change within cities, will need 
to consider how to continue to make 
active transport and micromobility 
options 
workable 
under 
these 

conditions, not just for the most 

experienced users but for all who 
want to use them. This requires 
thinking about the design of the 
actual infrastructure, the design of 
the surrounding environment, the 
planning of amenities—including 
rest stops, lighting, and bike-fixing 
stations—and the way we operate 
and maintain our infrastructure, 
such as winter snow removal.” The 
infrastructural necessities essential 
for overhauling dependency on 
personal vehicles are not quick 
fixes but rather demand decades 
of progress in hopes of addressing 
the problems caused by this 
dependency. 

To phase out cars, all travel 

destinations that cannot be reached 
through 
some 
combination 
of 

public transportation (trains, buses, 
airplanes, etc.) or foot travel should 
also be redesigned or reconfigured. 
Places that are remote, single-use 
developments or destinations that 
wouldn’t exist in the first place 
without cars to provide access to 
them could not exist in a carless 
society. Even more, getting rid of 
them would be beneficial in multiple 
facets, as strip malls tend to be 
displeasing to the eye and suburbs 
are at best ecologically burdensome 
and spatially inefficient.

The University’s tools will not dismantle the University

T

he United States prides 
itself 
on 
maintaining 

a 
strict 
separation 
of 

church 
and 
state, 
denouncing 

the 
entanglement 
of 
religion 

and government and permitting 
citizens to practice any religion 
of their choice. However, aside 
from the occasional court decision 
prohibiting prayer in a public 
school, evidence suggests this “strict 
separation” is more of a hanging 
sheet: a barrier, but not one that fully 
prevents mingling between sides. 
Though civics classes may have 
informed you otherwise, the line 
between government and religious 
involvement is often blurred. The 
historical use of religious beliefs to 
ridicule candidates for government 
office, as well as the strong 
correlation 
between 
religious 

beliefs and voter behavior in the 
U.S.,, make it hard to believe church 
and state are truly separate.

Thomas Jefferson and James 

Madison originated the concept 
of a separation of church and state 
in the government of the United 
States. In his letter to the Danbury 
Baptist Association in Connecticut, 
Jefferson called religion a “matter 
which lies solely between Man & 
his God,” adding that there should 
be a “wall of separation between 
Church & State” in the U.S. 
government. The establishment 
clause of the First Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution serves 
as the manifestation of this idea. 
By including it among the first 
additions 
to 
the 
Constitution, 

Jefferson and Madison indicated 
the importance of the separation 
of church and state in the U.S. 
government, yet it seems not to be 
upheld in the modern day.

After 
Theodore 
Roosevelt 

opted not to run for another term 
as 
president, 
the 
Republicans 

nominated 
William 
Howard 

Taft as the party’s candidate for 
the position in 1908. Democrats 
began attacking Taft, citing his 
religious 
beliefs 
as 
evidence 

against his ability to serve as 
President, despite the supposed 
governmental 
separation 
of 

church and state. Taft identified 
as a Catholic and a Unitarian, 
which ruffled the feathers of many 
Protestants, who felt these beliefs 
meant Taft did not recognize 
Christ’s divinity and would act 
with hostility toward Protestants 
in the country. In spite of these 
criticisms, Taft won the election, 
with remarks from Roosevelt. 
He deemed it outrageous “even 
to agitate such a question as a 
man’s religious convictions for the 
purpose of influencing a political 
election,” warning Americans of 
the dangers of allowing religion to 
influence the government. 

Did 
Americans 
heed 
his 

warning, though? No — the 
religious 
views 
of 
candidates 

continued to serve as evidence for 
or against their abilities to lead. 
Al Smith, presidential candidate 
in the 1928 election, received 
criticism during his campaign 
from William Allen White, editor 
of the Emporia Gazette at the time, 
who labeled Smith as a threat to 
“the whole Puritan civilization 
which (had) built a sturdy, orderly 
nation” in accordance with his 
Catholicism.

In the 2008 and 2012 Republican 

primaries, the candidates “who 
most 
explicitly 
appealed 
to 

religious voters” were preferred 
by Republicans who reported 
the most frequent attendance at 
religious services, and there was 
a direct relationship between the 
likelihood of supporting these 
candidates and the frequency of 
attendance at religious services. 
Even now, approximately half 

of Americans claim that the 
possession of strong religious 
beliefs is a factor of reasonable 
importance 
when 
considering 

political candidates.

The integration of church and 

state will not be put on pause for the 
2020 presidential election. Despite 
most Americans viewing President 
Donald Trump as the least religious 
of the 2016 presidential candidates, 
the majority of white Protestants, 
who make up a sizable portion of 
the American population, now 
express support for his presidency 
and reelection. Trump has made a 
considerable effort to appeal to the 
Protestant population throughout 
his term, notably taking a photo with 
a Bible in front of St. John’s Church 
in Washington, D.C. this June to 
publicize his supposed commitment 
to Christianity.

Trump continued to vocalize 

his 
newfound 
dedication 
to 

Christianity by diminishing the 
religious beliefs of presidential 
candidate Joe Biden. “He’s against 
God,” Trump declared, adding that 
Biden’s presidency would allow for 
“no religion” and would “hurt God.” 
Biden is openly Catholic, like past 
political leaders William Taft and 
Al Smith, so these remarks bear a 
striking resemblance to those made 
by past critics of such leaders. Trump 
capitalizes on the historical prejudice 
toward Catholics in the U.S. in order 
to obtain and maintain the support 
of Protestants, who make up a large 
proportion of American voters. He 
takes religion, what Jefferson called 
a “matter which lies solely between 
Man & his God,” and exploits it for 
political gain.

The separation of church and state, or lack thereof

ILANA MERMELSTEIN | COLUMNIST

“

If the structure does not permit 
dialogue the structure must be 
changed.” — Paulo Freire

Today, for the first time, I picked 

up my favorite, well-worn navy 
Michigan shirt, took one look at it, 
and put it back on the shelf. It’s one of 
those shirts that’s a favorite because 
it’s simple — across the chest, it has 
“Michigan” written in maize block 
letters that are starting to crack from 
so many washes, and there’s a hole 
slowly spreading along the seam in 
the right armpit. I still remember 
when it had its original rough 
texture, as most of the standard 
Meijer shirts do. I wore it proudly on 
my high school graduation day at my 
high school, honored to show off the 
new place I’d be calling home.

My four years in Ann Arbor 

taught me more about myself than I 
could have expected. While formal 
education challenged me in the 
classroom, my real learning came 
through 
student 
organizations 

and student activism. I remember 
bearing witness to the Coalition for 
Tuition Equality, protests spring 
of my sophomore year. I watched 
undocumented students and those 
fighting in solidarity protesting at 

the Michigan Union intersection 
until 
eight 
were 
arrested 
for 

obstructing traffic. That fall, shortly 
after tuition equality was passed by 
the University’s Board of Regents, 
the Black Student Union demanded 
a 
reckoning 
with 
the 
implicit 

and explicit ways the University 
continued to protect anti-Black 
behavior on campus. Covering the 
posting wall with black chalkboard 
paper overnight until #BBUM (Being 
Black at the University of Michigan) 
turned into a viral Twitter campaign.

Two years later, we witnessed 

the Islamophobia and xenophobia 
present in many divisions of the 
University as the Center for Campus 
Involvement planned, and then 
canceled, and then rescheduled a 
screening of American Sniper for 
UMix, despite the reports that the 
film’s release had fueled a rise in 
violence against Muslims across the 
U.S. Even then, President Schlissel’s 
response was underwhelming; he 
asked us to acknowledge and value 
“underlying values (that) are at odds” 
while “work(ing) through them to 
achieve a balance that will allow 
us to grow as individuals and as an 
institution of higher learning.” 

As an exhausted senior one 

month away from graduation, I 
had already learned from countless 
meetings 
with 
the 
University 

administration that promises were 
often empty, and meetings were 
simply for the appearance of good 
faith. Still, below the resentment 
that had grown like a hard skin 
over my pre-college 18-year-old 
self’s pride, there was still an 
underlying feeling of love for and 
faith in the University community, 
not the administration, to find 
our path forward as we worked 
through the burdens of pursuing 
higher education in a country that 
refuses to acknowledge its long-
standing structural investment in 
anti-Blackness, white supremacy, 
patriarchy and anti-indigeneity. 

I share this recent legacy of 

student protest and resistance 
to 
oppressive 
University 

administration policy to remind us 
that this struggle is not new nor is 
it over. While the GEO3550’s strike 
has officially ended after Schlissel’s 
pursuit of legal action against 
graduate 
student 
employees, 

University staff carry on the original 
demands. Preserving the legacy of 

collective action at the University 
will be crucial in giving us, broader 
University community members, a 
deeper understanding of the extent 
of the administration’s violation(s). 
Without true consciousness, we 
cannot have true struggle.

As a former member of University 

residential staff and a current 
graduate 
student 
employee 
at 

another public university, I am no 
stranger to the ways the University 
system takes advantage of our labor, 
our livelihood and our vulnerable 
reliance on them. What is more 
surprising this time is the brazen 
disregard for human life and respect 
of the right to protest and demand 
a better community, of which the 
students and workers are an integral 
part. Through all of this, Schlissel 
and the rest of the administration 
are making their personal and 
political stance quite clear: profits 
over people. Thankfully the people 
have it the right way around and are 
putting their humanity and needs for 
safety and security first. 

To my fellow graduate students 

and other staff members who 
participated in strikes: Thank you 
for your endless labor and sacrifice 

on behalf of our community. While 
the University system blames the 
worker strike for the disarray and 
precarity of the students’ conditions, 
we know this is a regular tactic of the 
oppressor and will continue to stand 
with you until all demands are met 
with a mindset of abundance over 
scarcity.

To my fellow alumni: Now having 

reaped the benefits of the social 
capital that the Michigan credential 
provides, it is our responsibility to 
leverage this power and access to 
force the administration to treat this 
situation with more care, seriousness 
and a deeper investment in student 
and staff well-being. I implore those 
of you who make regular donations 
to the University to withhold your 
donations until all demands are met, 
and ensure that you are clear to the 
University this is why you are no 
longer donating.

To the University administration: 

You claim to bleed maize and blue, to 
love this University and its people. 
But we’ve seen your negligence when 
our own people have been bleeding 
in the streets and your opportunistic 
emails when the emotions have 
boiled over enough that they must 

be acknowledged. When Black 
students fought for desegregation 
in the 1960s, white University 
administrators 
appointed 
Black 

administrators to filter out students’ 
justice-based demands that would 
actually force the University to 
live up to its public mission. The 
students and staff know that the 
Cube only spins because of our 
labor and continued investment in 
the same institution that betrays 
our humanity. Your indecision and 
apathy masked as thoughtfulness 
or bureaucratic processes will no 
longer fool us; we will come together 
as loudly as we do on game day to 
make our voices heard.

Today, for the first time, I picked 

up my favorite shirt and felt … 
embarrassed. Ashamed, I tuck my 
diploma away on a dusty shelf and, as 
I continue to reap the benefits of this 
credential and use it to create the 
University of Michigan we imagine, 
I wait and watch for the day it feels 
worth displaying again.

M

any 
University 
of 

Michigan students and 
Michigan residents are 

quick to criticize our state’s climate 
— bitter cold winters, short summers 
and even shorter springs and autumns 
make it hard to enjoy the parts of the 
year we appreciate most. Though 
the cold is easy to complain about, 
Michiganders, or Midwesterners 
broadly, should consider themselves 
blessed. Blessed because we often 
do not have to experience firsthand 
the catastrophic effects of natural 
disasters fueled by our changing 
climate. 
Californians, 
however, 

cannot share the same level of safety. 

Over the past month, California, 

along with Oregon and Washington, 
has been facing an unprecedented 
burst of wildfires across the state. On 
Sept. 27 alone, the state was battling 
25 major wildfires at once, calling 
for 17,000 firefighters on the front 
lines to help diminish the spread and 
magnitude of the blaze.

The history of California wildfires 

foreshadows a frightening trend. 
From 2001 to 2010, there was a total 
of 7.03 million acres of land burned 
by fires. From 2010 to 2020, the 
number increased to 10.8 million 
acres. In 2020 alone, however, there 
have been 3.2 million acres of land 
burned by over 7,900 fires. The area 
of land burned in one year equates to 
almost 1/3 of the total land burned in 
the last decade, leaving behind ashes 
and ruins that sum to roughly the 
same area as the state of Connecticut.

Though 
September 
marks 

the beginning of fall and cooler 
temperatures, 
scientists 
predict 

that these fires will persist through 
October. The numbers continue to rise. 

Meanwhile, 
the 
Trump 

administration 
continues 
to 

remain silent in response to the 
fires. Other than President Donald 
Trump’s issuance of a major disaster 
declaration on Aug. 22 in response 

to California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 
request, Trump has not shown 
any support for combatting this 
continuing disaster.

Instead, he has shown ignorance 

and an appalling lack of leadership 
during a roundtable with federal, state 
and local officials of California. Wade 
Crowfoot, secretary of California 
Natural Resources Agency, pleaded 
Trump to “recognize the changing 
climate and what it means to 
(California’s) forests” and to “actually 
work together with that science.” 

We would like to imagine that our 

president would address this concern 
with respect and cooperation. But 
Trump’s response conveyed the 
exact opposite. 

“Ok, it’ll start getting cooler,” 

Trump scoffed. “You just watch.” 

But will it? Noah Diffenbaugh, 

climate 
scientist 
at 
Stanford 

University, completely denied this 
claim in his response to the statement, 
noting that “we have very clear 
evidence that California is warming. 
There is no scientific evidence that 
California is on the cusp of a long-
term cooling trend.” 

Let’s put ourselves in the shoes 

of California residents. Twenty-six 
people are dead. More than 6,400 
structures were destroyed. And 
what does our nation’s leader decide 
is an appropriate response to a state 
official’s cry for help? To tell him to 
“just watch.”

This is not the first time our 

president has utterly neglected the 
science behind climate change, and 
we as morally-conscious citizens 
need to make sure that this will be 
the last of it. Election Day is less than 
two months away, and we must elect 
a leader who will prioritize our health 
and safety, the generations to come 
and the world as we know it. 

Trump does not just deny climate 

change. He fuels it. Over the past few 
years of his term, Trump has made 

many executive orders that roll back 
regulations aimed to limit pollution 
and protect the environment. To 
name a few, he loosened offshore 
drilling safety rules that were 
implemented after the disastrous BP 
oil explosion in 2010; in April 2019, 
he signed two executive pipeline 
orders, one of which gives him the 
authority to “issue, deny or amend” 
permits for pipelines that cross 
international borders; one month 
earlier, he approved drilling for the 
controversial Keystone pipeline; 
he appointed Andrew Wheeler as 
the EPA administrator in February 
2019, a former coal lobbyist who 
has undone Obama-era regulations 
on coal power plant emissions since 
taking the position. The list goes on.

Clearly, for Trump, the economic 

success of energy corporations is 
a higher priority than protecting 
the natural resources that these 
companies exploit. Despite his track 
record of rolling back regulations 
aimed 
to 
limit 
environmental 

damage 
caused 
by 
corporate 

drilling and pollution, he attempts 
to disguise this developing disaster 
by convincing the public that the 
United States is excelling in air and 
water purity — he made a remark 
in the past year that “we have the 
cleanest air in the world, in the 
United States, and it’s gotten better 
since I’m president.” This claim has 
been proven false.

Trump also said that proper 

forest management, specifically a 
“rake” of forest floors to remove dry 
debris, would make the fires on the 
West Coast completely cease. This 
statement, as well, was also proven 
false.

In the United States there has 

long been a strange fascination 
with stories of the American 
backwoods — gritty tales of 
brazen crime, graphic murder, 
religious 
fanaticism 
and 

twisted mentalities. They fixate 
on the post-war rural South and 
glorify the violence that erupts 
among the backwoods folk. And 
there’s never a person of color 
in sight.

This is the vein of “The Devil 

All the Time,” a stark tale of 
rural Ohio and West Virginia 
in the 1950s and ‘60s. It’s a 
big story, with lots of people 
to keep track of — characters 
who connect in unexpected 
ways and storylines that swing 
around to fill in gaps. There 
are enough familiar faces in 
its vast ensemble cast to keep 
it relevant, but in the end, the 
biggest detriment to “Devil” is 
that it didn’t need to be made.

“Devil” is built around an 

amalgamation of caricatures. 
The disturbed veteran, the 
pious virgin, the self-important 
priest, the psycho killer, the 
corrupt sheriff — they’re all 
built on simple characteristics 
that drive home exactly what 
kind of story it is, and where 
you’ve seen it before. All of the 
characters are forced toward 
extremes — murderer or victim, 
religious fanatic or indifferent 
bystander. The timeline jumps 
around haphazardly to keep up 
with the individual plots (which 
are too complicated to explain 
in a few sentences, so I won’t 
try), and the opening exposition 
is long and complex because 

every backtrack incorporates 
seemingly 
peripheral 

characters into the body of the 
story.

The 
film’s 
standout 

performances are its biggest 
names: Robert Pattinson (“The 
Lighthouse”) 
as 
Preacher 

Preston 
Teagardin, 
Bill 

Skarsgård (“It”) as Willard 
Russell 
and 
Tom 
Holland 

(“Spider-Man: 
Far 
From 

Home”) 
as 
Arvin 
Russell. 

Pattinson’s 
performance 
is 

fascinatingly exaggerated, but 
effective: Every word out of 
his mouth sounds almost like a 
comedic impression of a slimy 
Southern preacher rather than 
a realization of one, resulting 
in a character who is easy 
to despise. And Skarsgård’s 
compelling 
portrayal 
of 
a 

troubled war veteran gives 
us the beginnings of Arvin’s 
relationship 
with 
violence 

— a tradition of thoughtful, 
aggressive vengeance that is 
passed on from father to son.

Though it takes 45 minutes 

of time jumps and exposition 
before our first glimpse of 
Holland, the wait is worth 
it — not only because of how 
Holland pulls off a denim jacket, 
but also due to the skill he uses 
to approach the character. He 
is perfectly expressionless; you 
can tell exactly how much he 
cares for his step-sister Lenora 
(Eliza Scanlen, “Little Women”) 
or hates the bullies that torment 
her without much change in 
his facial expression. His quiet 
pain is present after every 
tragedy, perfectly balanced in a 
film where almost every other 
character feels out of control. A 
scene in which Arvin confronts 
Preacher 
Teagardin 
is 
a 

reminder of what happens when 
talented actors work together: 
The 
quiet 
intensity 
from 

Holland and selfish ignorance 
from Pattinson combine to 
create a masterful tension.

“The Devil All the Time” has 

all of the traits of a backwoods 
story. 
The 
women 
are 

essentially disposable beyond 
emotional significance, killed 
off one by one. Every character’s 
moral compass is a shade of 
grey, where the ethics of point-
blank murder depend on the 
character. 
Because 
actions 

don’t actually speak louder than 
words, scenes are overlaid with 
omniscient narration in a strong 
Southern drawl — done by 
Donald Ray Pollack, the author 
of the book on which the film 
is based — to give you a small 
amount of insight. And there’s 
a disturbing on-screen killing 
about every five minutes.

This film is a marathon. 

It’s nearly 140 minutes long, 
deeply captivating at times but 
brutally slow at others. The film 
is classified as a psychological 
thriller, but it’s not too thrilling, 
and the only thing psychological 
about it is the twisted psyches of 
the killers. Though it’s visually 
captivating, the plot doesn’t 
feel much like a plot, and so the 
ending doesn’t feel much like 
an ending. All throughout “The 
Devil All the Time,” violence 
begets violence; yet even as the 
layers of dark and disturbing 
fuse 
towards 
something 

towards 
a 
conclusion, 
it’s 

difficult to figure out what you 
were supposed to learn that you 
didn’t already know.

FILM REVIEW

‘The Devil All the Time’ 
feels behind the times

Live-streamed solo recitals 

are nothing new in the era 
of COVID-19, but most have 
typically taken place in living 
rooms 
and 
smaller 
venues. 

Last Sunday night on Sept. 
20, however, Music, Theatre 
& Dance professor Matthew 
Bengtson’s 
live-streamed 

concert 
was 
an 
unusual 

exception. 
The 
assistant 

professor of music and piano 
literature 
performed 
“Great 

Solo 
Piano 
Works 
from 

my Lifetime” to an empty 
Stamps Auditorium — an 
appropriately grand space for 
the programmed music.

Bengtson started off the 

recital with a few opening 
remarks, the most salient point 
being that all the programmed 
music was written after World 
War II, with the most recent 
piece written in 2003. However, 
he said, the concert was not a 
“new music” concert. In many 
classical conservatory settings, 
any music written after World 
War II usually counts as “new 
music,” from degree auditions to 
jury requirements. Bengtson, a 
fervent early and contemporary 
music 
enthusiast, 
disagrees 

with this concept — “new 
music,” he argued, is music that 
is happening now. Music that 
was written as far back as fifty 
years ago is no longer new. The 

concert highlighted some well-
known and some more obscure 
solo piano pieces by George 
Walker, Henri Dutilleux and 

Lukas Foss and Music, Theatre 
& Dance composition professor 
Paul Schoenfeld. 

The 
first 
piece 
was 

Schoenfeld’s 
1997 

“Peccadilloes,” which consisted 
of six movements, many of 
which were greatly influenced 
by J.S. Bach. The contrapuntal 
harmonies in the first, third 
and fifth movements especially 
suggested characteristics from 
Bach’s fugues and toccatas. 
The piece as a whole was 
one highly representative of 
Schoenfeld’s music, which is 
known to incorporate sound 
blends of classical, folk and 
popular 
genres. 
While 
the 

sound quality over the live-
stream was less than ideal, 
Bengtson’s intelligent attention 
to melodic subject lines and 
color 
interpretation 
shone 

through. 

The second piece, George 

Walker’s 2003 “Fifth Piano 
Sonata,” 
was 
a 
highly 

substantive one that Bengtson 
played with great power and 
control. 
Before 
beginning, 

Bengtson described the piece 
as a sonata that should be 
recognized among the greats as 
one with profound “rhythmic 
muscle and nothing for special 
effect.” 
He 
compared 
the 

piece to the sonatas of Brahms 

and Beethoven. The sonata 
was chordally dense and rife 
with 
dissonances, 
yet 
very 

lyrical with an unforgettably 
haunting opening and main 
theme. The whole piece was 
surprisingly very short – a total 
of only five and a half minutes, 
which effectively added to its 
tempestuous drama.

The 
final 
two 
pieces, 

Dutilleux’s 
Three 
Preludes 

for Piano (1973-88) and Lukas 
Foss’s 1981 “Solo” were the most 
tonally distinct, utilizing atonal 
and 
12-tone 
compositional 

techniques. 
The 
Dutilleux 

was 
transcendent 
— 
the 

piece emphasized the piano’s 
resonance to create formal 
continuity within the second 
prelude and used the full range 
of the keys. The Foss was, as 

Bengtson 
described, 
“very 

humorous,” with an intriguing 
style 
hybrid 
of 
minimalist 

and 12-tone approaches. The 
piece very clearly had several 
voices that seemed to “talk” 
all at once. The very beginning 
began with a single voice that 

came across as possibly telling 
a joke to the audience but was 
abruptly 
interrupted, 
which 

happened 
successively 
until 

more and more voices were 
introduced, breaking into a 
final wild frenzy. 

The concert was a refreshing 

start to the new academic year 
for the music school, especially 
the piano department, given 
Bengtson’s creative repertoire 
choices 
and 
meticulous 

execution. The presentation, 
too, was a welcome concert 
vision that will hopefully be 
carried out further in the 
months to come.

Ah, to be Asian and second-

generation American. What a 
wonderful and vexing experience. 
This 
week 
on 
Hyphenated, 

we take a closer look at three 
movies on Netflix and how they 
normalize “second generation” 
APIA experiences.

To clarify, second generation or 

“second gen” refers to Americans 
born within the bounds of these 
United States to immigrant, “first 
gen” parents.

But what does it mean to be 

“second generation”? What does 
that experience look and sound 
like? Many try to distill the 
elusive second-gen experience 
but fall short in their imagination. 
Some media hyperfixate and 
problematize being APIA without 
recognizing 
that 
APIA 
lives 

sprawl luxuriously beyond the 
constructed confines of race and 
culture. While there is some truth 
to these popularized narratives 
 
— 
children 
chafing 
against 

strict immigrant parents — that 
experience does not exist in a 
race-culture-causal vacuum.

Second gen APIA individuals 

are APIA every moment of their 
lives, not just when they fit a 
stereotype. 

To escape narrow second 

generation narratives, grab some 
popcorn and enjoy one (or more!) 
of the films listed below. Because 
it is nearing Korean Thanksgiving 
(Chuseok), 
Hyphenated 
will 

dole out Chuseok food recs to 
accompany each movie.

“Seoul 
Searching” 
by 

director-producer Benson Lee 
(2016)

Accompanying 
this 
movie 

is a traditional food eaten on 
Chuseok: jeon, basically pan-
fried anything. A popular jeon, 
relatively easy to make, is dae-
gu jeun (cod, battered and pan-
fried!). You can also add my 
personal favorite hobak jeun (pan 
fried battered squash) to your 
plate.

“Seoul 
Searching” 
builds 

off of John Huges’ 1985 “The 
Breakfast 
Club,” 
creating 
a 

similar, aggressively ’80s movie 
about the teenage struggle. In one 
epic summer, a disparate group 
of teenagers from all reaches of 
the globe come together under 
one roof for a culture program 
run by the Korean Government. 
What results is a breathtakingly 
hilarious 
summer 
camp 

experience. I was not expecting to 

laugh during this aggressively ’80s 
movie but “Seoul Searching” had 
me wheezing towards the middle. 
Very few things are funnier than 
watching 
an 
overly 
militant 

Korean American teenager try to 
pick a fight with North Korean 
soldiers at the DMZ. 

But 
like 
the 
Breakfast 

Club, 
“Seoul 
Searching” 
is 

fundamentally about the second 
gen experience overlayed with 
the stress of being a teenager. 
Each student desperately wants 
to present themselves in a certain 
way. They use clothes and big 
hair to explore their boundaries 
and their conception of who they 
are, papermache-ing outer shells 
informed by their home country 
trends and lived experiences. In 
visually differentiating characters 
by 
cultural 
trends, 
“Seoul 

Searching” pokes fun at culture 
shock, dramatizing the ways 
assimilation 
and 
immigration 

have individually transformed 
the teenagers’ lives.

With 
a 
consciousness 
for 

anti-Japanese racism, childhood 
abuse 
and 
adoption, 
“Seoul 

Searching” 
explores 
more 

complex issues. The fumbling, 
uncertain 
teenagers 
reach 
a 

mature understanding by the 
end of the movie. Yes, the actions 
and opinions of all people are 
influenced by their upbringing, 
but that lived experience does 
not make them and their actions 
justified.

“Seoul Searching” succeeded 

brilliantly in documenting how 
much of a confusing wilderness 
identity, sexuality and globalism 
can be. 

“To All the Boys I’ve Loved 

Before” directed by Susan 
Johnson (2018)

Accompanying this movie is a 

healthy helping of Bindae-tteok. 
This isn’t a typical Korean practice 
but on Chuseok, my family always 
eats Bindae-tteok stacked with a 
thick slice of Jeolpyeon (a kind of 
tteok, rice cake) and kimchi.

The movie adaption of Jenny 

Han’s book invigorated my tired 
old bones when I first watched 
it. I related to how tangential 
Lara Jean’s race was treated. 
Her central conflict was not 
cultural but rather a sweet and 
romantic 
fake-dating 
snafu. 

But upon re-watching the film 
for this column, I became more 
appreciative of the subtle ways 
the film included race.

The 
main 
character 
Lara 

Jean’s race was never at the 
forefront of the book’s plot but I 
always appreciated the author’s 

small details that signaled that 
Lara Jean wasn’t wholly white 
despite her predominantly white 
school and white father. She and 
her family, in remembrance of 
her deceased Korean American 
mother, maintain some Korean 
holiday traditions. Despite not 
knowing the language, Lara 
Jean ate some Korean food and 
drank special probiotic drinks 
like Yacult, unfound in most local 
supermarkets.

If “Seoul Searching” dove 

deep into untangling the knot 
of personal and cultural hang-
ups, “To All the Boys I’ve loved 
Before” 
successfully 
captured 

the normal levity of being second 
generation for many second gen 
students.

“The Half of It” directed and 

written by Alice Wu (2020)

Accompanying 
this 
movie 

is 
japchae, 
stir-fried 
glass 

noodles mixed with thinly sliced 
vegetables mixed with soy sauce 
and sesame oil. While not my 
favorite Korean dish, this is a 
staple of Korean cuisine. 

I saw “The Half of It” for the 

first time only last week but it has 
been very well received by critics 
of The Michigan Daily (please 
check out both the Daily Arts and 
The Statement sections for a more 
comprehensive review).

Ellie Chu, the protagonist of 

“The Half of It” is a quiet girl, 
neither out of the closet nor free 
with her personality. At home, she 
cares for her father. His limited 
English language skills make her 
his proxy. She pays their electric 
bills because the call center people 
reportedly cannot understand 
him through his accent. Her role 
as translator is a familiar situation 
for many second gen individuals. 

Similarly to “To All the Boys 

I’ve Loved Before,” “The Half of 
It” doesn’t fixate its plot on APIA 
immigrant struggles. But also 
like “To All the Boys,”the film 
still alienates and references race. 
For Ellie, racism plays a big part 
in her narrative about alienation. 
She feels frustrated people cannot 
look past her father’s accent. In 
school, she gets jokes about her 
last name, Ellie “chu chu.” Unlike 
Lara Jean of “To All the Boys I’ve 
Loved Before,” Ellie is friendless, 
largely excluded from the social 
fabric of her small town. That 
begins to change as Ellie gets 
involved in a classically Cyrano de 
Bergerac plot to help a hapless guy 
woo the prettiest girl in school.

Last week, Mickey Guyton made 

history as the first Black woman 
to perform solo at the Academy of 
Country Music Awards. She sang 
to an empty Grand Ole Opry house 
where lights lined the pews instead 
of people. The audience watching 
from home was largely unfamiliar 
with Guyton or her music — her 
debut “Better Than You Left Me” 
peaked at #34 on the Billboard 
Country Airplay Chart in 2015, her 
highest-charting single to date. 
Nonetheless, Guyton made the most 
of the moment. Her performance of 
“What Are You Gonna Tell Her?” 
unflinchingly addressed why it’s 
taken so long to break the double-
layered race and gender barrier in 
country music. 

“What Are You Gonna Tell Her?” 

is one of six songs on Guyton’s 
latest EP Bridges, and it pulls no 
punches. The piano ballad is a stark 
contrast to the sparkly girl-power 
anthems that are typically enlisted 
to address inequality. Instead, 
Guyton zeroes in on these anthems’ 
aftermath, asserting that the belief 
that “dreams” and “hard work” 
will be enough just isn’t the truth. 
The topics she touches on include 
racism and homophobia and reflect 
the same harsh reality. 

But Guyton doesn’t stop there — 

the majority of Bridges addresses 
social justice issues. Her current 
single, “Heaven Down Here” was 
written after Guyton watched the 

video of George Floyd’s murder. 
“Black Like Me,” which has gained 
some traction on TikTok, was 
written long before this summer’s 
protests, but hadn’t had much 
of a chance of being released. It 
challenges what so many country 
songs take for granted: Americans’ 
freedom. “If you think we live in the 
land of the free you should try to be 
Black like me,” Guyton contends on 
the piano-driven track.

Even 
Guyton’s 
lighthearted 

songs are meant to flip the script. 
The playfully woozy “Rosé” finds 
Guyton unabashedly singing the 
praises of her drink of choice — 
something that’s old hat for the 
men of country music but far less 
common in songs by women. “Salt” 
is a twist on Carrie Underwood’s 
“Cowboy Casanova.” This time 
the girl in the “look-at-me dress” 
is the “snake” and the star of the 
slide-guitar-laden Wild West show 
she’s been written into. Despite 
these playful asides, Bridges is 
overwhelmingly a call to action. 
Contrary to many country artists’ 
responses to the social justice 
movement, the title track asserts 
that “We’re gonna need more than 
prayers and wishes.”

In its own way, Apple Music 

has attempted to rise to these 
challenges Guyton points to in the 
industry. The streaming platform 
launched 
the 
“Apple 
Music 

Country” radio station this August 
— simultaneously recognizing that 
“radio is part of the fabric of country 
music culture” and that the way 
people listen to music is changing. 

The station boasts five daily on-air 
hosts, including a show by Black 
country singer-songwriter Tiera. 

It’s also home to shows curated 

by a diverse array of artists. 
BRELAND, 
Willie 
Jones 
and 

Rissi Palmer have all been tapped 
to contribute. While terrestrial 
radio has embraced the sounds 
and stylings of hip hop for years 
(hello Sam Hunt), it’s only been 
considered 
“country” 
if 
the 

“inspiration” shows up in music 
by white people (hello “Old Town 
Road” controversy). “Apple Music 
Country” is a step toward changing 
that. By acknowledging country 
music’s increasing diversity and 
reaffirming Black artists’ place in 
the genre, Apple Music is providing 
opportunities for Black artists to 
gain a foothold.

Again and again, the country 

music industry at large has shirked 
this same responsibility. While 
plenty of listeners hadn’t heard from 
Guyton’s perspective before “What 
Are You Gonna Tell Her?” on the 
ACMs, industry insiders have. In 
fact, when Guyton debuted the song 
in February to an auditorium full of 
radio executives, she got a standing 
ovation. But nothing changed — the 
song wasn’t picked up by enough 
radio stations to start charting. 
Guyton has been signed to Capitol 
Nashville since 2011 and was 
nominated for an ACM in 2016, but 
she still hasn’t been able to release a 
full-length album.

Controversial ‘Cuties’ isn’t 
what Ted Cruz thinks it is

The backlash is bipartisan: 

both Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Tulsi 
Gabbard have called “Cuties” 
child porn. Following the release 
of the film’s trailer and (an ill-
conceived) poster, daily Netflix 
cancellations surged 5x, and a 
Change.org petition has over 
750,000 signatures calling for “the 
investigation of the parents, staff, 
director and especially Netflix.” 
Oh, 
and 
the 
#CancelNetflix 

hashtag was born.

What’s strange is that the 

film community’s reaction was 
overwhelmingly positive when 
“Cuties” debuted at Sundance in 
January. So, what went wrong?

Richard Brody of the New 

Yorker states, “I doubt that the 
scandal-mongers have actually 
seen ‘Cuties,’ but some elements of 
the film that weren’t presented in 
the advertising would surely prove 
irritating to them: it’s the story of a 
girl’s outrage at, and defiance of, a 
patriarchal order.” For starters, 
this film, as a social critique, is 
impossible to summarize in 94 
seconds (the length of the trailer, 
which is consequently the 44th 
most disliked video on YouTube), 
which means it is even more futile 
to attempt to convey the thesis in a 
single image. Even so, there were 
less offensive possibilities for the 
movie poster. Just as you don’t 
understand Yorgos Lanthimos’s 
“The Lobster” from a poster or 
trailer, to presume to understand 
“Cuties” from its trailer is unfair. 
Even a review you read in The 
Michigan Daily can’t tell the 
whole story. But I will try to cut 

through the noise and elucidate 
the social implications of this 
important film. 

“Cuties” is a story about modern 

girlhood in the age of Instagram, 
TikTok and “WAP.” The film also 
navigates the challenges faced 
by immigrants to adapt to a new 
culture without losing their roots. 
It follows 11-year-old Ami (Faitha 
Youssouf) as she desperately 
tries to find independence from 
her religious family through 
friendship and community. Ami’s 
first friends are four classmates 
who are practicing to compete in 
a dance competition. Before Ami 
ingratiates herself, these four 
girls bully her for her understated 
outfits. Herself unable to dance, 
Ami is unable to curry favor as a 
troupe-mate, and finds that she 
must dress like her new friends 
to be accepted. This means 
baring skin, which makes Ami 
uncomfortable: She hides her 
midriff with a hoodie when older 
boys leer at the girls. Ultimately, 
she chooses to sacrifice her own 
comfort for the sake of popularity. 

Ami’s 
family 
is 
beyond 

uncomfortable with midriffs and 
tight skirts. Devoutly religious, 
Ami’s mother and aunt make it 
very clear that they think Ami 
is dressing (in their words) like a 
“whore.” The disapproval of her 
family only fuels Ami’s drive for 
independence and her desire to 
learn how to dance like her friends. 
Previously 
only 
the 
troupe’s 

filmographer, when the friend 
group ousts one of their dancers 
only days before the competition 
try-outs, Ami volunteers to step 
in. She’s been practicing and 
“studying,” and even adds to 
the routine by teaching her new 

friends how to twerk. 

Wait – isn’t Ami 11? And her 

friends too? This is why Ted Cruz 
is mad. There is a lot of twerking 
in this film. There are very tight 
outfits. And the camera doesn’t 
hide any of it. This fact makes 
“Cuties” very challenging to watch 
at times. Director Maïmouna 
Doucouré 
(“Maman(s)”) 

acknowledges the discomforting 
nature of certain scenes, but 
retorts by saying, “if one really 
listens to 11-year-old girls, their 
lives are uncomfortable.” 

Ted Cruz’s anger and my 

discomfort come from two places. 
First, there is the very sound 
belief that young girls should not 
be sexualized in this way. And 
Doucouré herself agrees. Her film 
does not romanticize, but rather 
documents, lived reality. Having 
interviewed 
over 
a 
hundred 

Parisian 
preteens, 
Doucouré 

reports that “they saw that the 
sexier a woman is on Instagram 
or TikTok, the more likes she gets. 
They tried to imitate that sexuality 
in the belief that it would make 
them more popular.” But neither 
this film, nor my review of it, is 
a condemnation of social media. 
Ted Cruz wouldn’t say it is, either. 

I believe, and this is the second 

source of discomfort, that this 
film critically illuminates the 
fetishization, objectification and 
sexualization of women’s bodies 
at any age. If Doucouré argues that 
Ami twerks for popularity because 
she saw it online — well, the 
problem is not that Ami saw it, or 
that Ami wants to be popular. The 
problem is how our patriarchal 
society evaluates women based on 
sexual desirability. 

The discomfort I felt while 

watching this film was due to 
the inappropriateness of young 
girls behaving sexually. That 
dissonance is legitimate, but when 
I tried to investigate further what 
I was feeling, I had to ask myself: 
Why should wearing a tight skirt 
equate to “behaving sexually?” 
Our society has firmly linked a 
woman’s body with her sexuality, 
and subsequently with her worth 
as a person. That is the problem. 
If a woman of any age wishes to 
wear certain clothing, it is not for 
society to conflate her outfit with 
her sexual availability, just as two 
shirtless men playing catch in the 
street are no more sexual objects 
than they would be if they were 
fully clothed.

But I can’t close without 

clearly identifying and addressing 
the cause of mass outrage: the 
very 
real, 
not 
suggested 
or 

euphemized, 
sexualization 
of 

11-year-old 
characters 
(played 

by 14-year-old girls). There are 
plenty of examples of when the 
on-screen depiction of something 
socially 
grotesque 
conveys 
a 

powerful 
message 
about 
its 

depravity. Some directors like to 
push the envelope (Gaspar Noe’s 
“Irréverisble” comes to mind). 
But this film walks a very fine 
line, and seems not to know that 
sometimes it is best to describe, 
rather 
than 
depict, 
certain 

depravities. Doucouré defends 
her directorial choices by assuring 
viewers that “a trained counselor 
was present on set” and that “the 
project was even approved by 
the French government’s child 
protection authorities.” But, that’s 
akin to saying a veterinarian was 
present on the set of “Ben Hur.” 
Harm done is harm done, even if 
the “actors in the film had already 
seen these types of dances and 
more.” Many scenes are quite 
exploitative, and there is really 
no excuse for that. Monica Hesse 
of the Washington Post wrote, 
“Healthy adults won’t see the 
characters as sex objects; they’ll 
see them as children and they’ll 
see the dancing as disturbing.” I 
would reflect on this statement 
by saying the reason “healthy” 
adults will be disturbed is because 
the children are portrayed as sex 

objects. And that is not okay. 

In short, Ted Cruz missed 

Doucouré’s message. But when 
it comes to the images on screen, 
Cruz’s 
criticism 
has 
merit. 

“Cuties” illuminates real issues 
in our society. Foremost, that 
young girls have internalized 
an 
association 
between 
self-

worth and sexuality. Moreover, 
this association is founded on 
the 
patriarchy’s 
devaluation 

of women and fetishization of 
women’s bodies. These issues 
must be addressed and resolved. 
But the way to criticize the sexual 
objectification of young girls is not 
to take part in that exploitation. 
I fear that this film may pave the 
way for other directors to test 
what is acceptable in the realm of 
criticism-through-exhibition. 

For those who want to read 

more about this film, I highly 
recommend the Washington Post 
op-ed written by Doucouré, from 
which I pulled some of the above 
quotes.

Novel-in-verse ‘Punching’ 
takes on the carceral state

Award-winning author Ibi Zoboi 

and prison reform activist Yusef 
Salaam of the Exonerated Five 
joined forces to write their newly 
released novel-in-verse “Punching 
the Air.” In 1989, Yusef Salaam was 
one of the five boys wrongfully 
convicted in the “Central Park 
Jogger” case, which forced them to 
spend between seven and 13 years 
in jail until they were exonerated 
in 2002. Since being released, the 
five have received a multimillion 
dollar settlement from the city of 
New York, and their story has been 
documented in the 2012 film “The 
Central Park Five” and the 2019 
Netflix documentary series “When 
They See Us.” 

Zoboi writes that the wrongful 

conviction of the Exonerated Five 
awakened her and many others, “to 
the injustices of their country and 
of the world.” Having met Salaam 
two years after he was released 
from prison, Zoboi was a college 
reporter anxious to investigate the 
case and share Salaam’s story. Now, 
nearly 20 years after their first 
encounter, Zoboi brings Salaam’s 
perspective to light once more. 

In the novel, the fictional Amal 

Shahid is a 16-year-old Black 
Muslim poet and artist who is 
convicted of a crime he didn’t 
commit. Amal’s story begins in 
the courtroom, where he awaits 

his verdict. Though Amal’s story 
is inspired by Salaam’s, it is not an 
exact replica: “We decided that we 
had to make Amal a 2020 version 
of 1989 Yusef, and that is a boy who 
is incredibly self-aware,” Zoboi 
shared in an August interview 
with NPR. Infused with Salaam’s 
wisdom, perspective and even 
some of the poetry he wrote while 
incarcerated, Amal’s truth comes 
to life on the page. 

Amal’s life dramatically changes 

after one intense night when he is 
accused of assaulting a white boy. 
When he is found guilty, he is sent 
to a juvenile detention facility. An 
echo of Salaam, Amal is simply a 
boy who was in the wrong place 
at the wrong time; all the while, 
Amal is continuously referred to 
as “the defendant” and portrayed 
as a fully-grown man rather than 
the young boy he is. We follow 
Amal as he flashes between the 
past and present, wondering what 
his future will bring. His shifting 
emotional 
states 
are 
notably 

interwoven with recurrent motifs 
like stones, dust and butterflies, 
striking accompaniments to the 
verse that establishes an intimate 
and emotional connection between 
the reader and Amal. 

Throughout the novel, Amal 

transparently 
expresses 
his 

experiences in jail, which mostly 
confine him to his cell — four small 
corners. Alone, Amal is trapped in 
his own mind with his explosive 
thoughts. To escape and to express 

his anger and pain, Amal looks to 
art and poetry as outlets. When 
able, he attends poetry workshops 
(rewards for good behavior) and 
draws with broken crayons in his 
free time — “I didn’t know that 
/ I could hold this little / bit of 
freedom in my hands.” In addition 
to artistry bridging Amal and 
Salaam, Amal too has the support 
of his visiting family and friends, 
who bring him letters and books. 
They do not let Amal forget who he 
is as he battles in a setting designed 
to drain him of everything.

Through the use of verse, Zoboi 

illuminates the power of art and 
words that saves Amal from the 
sinking despair and rage that 
nearly swallow him whole, while 
detailing the unjust systems that 
have placed Amal in this position in 
the first place. This chiefly includes 
the judicial and prison systems in 
America that disproportionately 
fail and oppress Black people. One 
motif Zoboi and Salaam use is blind 
justice, invoking Lady Justice to 
give voice to this truth: “because 
where I come from / jail or death / 
were the two options she handed to 
us / because where he comes from 
/ the American Dream / was the 
one option she handed to them.” 
This sentiment is reiterated by the 
imbalanced structure of the verse, 
calling to mind the tipping scales 
Lady Justice holds.

“extremely online” to my friends, 
they usually agree — they too 
love memes and spend hours on 
Twitter.

gets messy. It usually turns into 
some form of me reciting my own 
version of Bane’s quote from “The 
Dark Knight Rises”: “You merely 
adopted the internet; I was born in 
it, molded by it.”

Like all great horror movies, 

“Antebellum” is barely fiction. 

In modern classics like “Get 

Out,” 
“The 
Babadook” 
and 

“Antebellum,” the fantasy comes 
not when the monsters show their 
ugly faces, but when they are 
vanquished.

Even at its most outlandish, the 

terror in “Antebellum” is not only 
plausible, but already happening. 
More than that — it is woven into 
the fabric of American society 
itself. “Antebellum” dives headfirst 
into the roiling open wound of 
American slavery and shows how, 
while its horrors may never be 
defeated, they still must be fought, 
tooth and nail. 

The film follows two characters 

played 
by 
Janelle 
Monáe 

(“Moonlight”), modern-day author 
and activist Veronica Henley, as 
well as Eden, a woman enslaved on 
a pre-Civil War plantation. In the 
film’s searing narrative, these two 
lives are revealed to be shockingly 
intertwined. 

With 
a 
powerhouse 

performance by Monáe, a visual 
brilliance that comes along once 
in a blood-red moon and twists to 
make you leap from their seat and 
clutch your hair, “Antebellum” is 
the best horror film of 2020. It’s 
also one of its most important 
movies, period. 

Without spoiling one of the most 

bone-shattering twists in horror 
since “The Sixth Sense,” the film 
draws colorful, shuddering cords 
between the hell of antebellum 
slavery and the modern era. It 

does so with a realistic, inquisitive 
and unflinching eye to befit 
the topics that it grapples with. 
Simultaneously, 
it’s 
absolutely 

chilling. Who knew that a movie 
which utters “intersectionality” 
could take your breath away?

Why, though, has “Antebellum” 

been so panned? Wouldn’t a 
“great” horror movie have more 
than a 29% on the Tomatometer? 
It deserves far better, but the 
cinematic 
establishment 
never 

takes horror easily. 

One critic called it too pedantic, 

more interested in making a “Big 
Point” than trying for any artistic 
merit. Another lamented that the 
film “is not subtle about what it is 
saying and what it is doing.” These 
have been common talking points 
for 
horror-bashers 
throughout 

cinematic history.

When “The Exorcist” shows a 

girl sexually assaulting her own 
mother, it is being too “indelicate” 
for the cinematic establishment, 
too obvious in its symbolism and 
too embarrassingly proletariat in 
its smarmy subject matter. When 
“Antebellum” has Janelle Monáe, 
one of the most iconic and lauded 
Black icons of the modern era, face 
off against a Confederate general, 
it is deemed too “simple ... lazily 
reminding us of the cruelty of 
America’s past.”

Is “Alien”’s invocation of violent 

misogyny “pedantic”? Are the 
brutal treatises of mental illness in 
“Hereditary” and “Midsommar” 
“pedantic”? 
What 
about 
the 

exploration of hysteria in “Invasion 
of The Body Snatchers” and “Night 
of The Living Dead”? “Gojira” isn’t 
shy about symbolizing nuclear 
trauma. Look into that giant 

lizard’s ravaged face and call him 
“pedantic.” I dare you. 

Maybe horror has always been 

“pedantic.” Maybe it has always 
made stomach-churning, blood-
soaked “big points.” Maybe it has 
always depicted the inexplicable 
with little qualms to expose the 
real social wounds that lurk behind 
the rubber suits and plastic teeth. 

Yet by doing so, horror forces 

viewers to grapple with the 
ungrappleable 
in 
a 
medium 

without limits. The sheer creativity 
of great horror can unpack taboo 
topics before the mainstream 
even deigns to turn its head. No 
other movie could pierce the 
cyclonic political climate of 2020 
like “Antebellum” and offer such a 
sweeping, necessary catharsis. 

“Antebellum” 
drips 
with 

cinematic 
talent. 
Its 
use 
of 

color is incredible, contrasting 
oversaturated reds, yellows and 
greens with the grime and sulfuric 
gaslight of the antebellum era to 
show how an ancient, systemic 
horror lurks behind the saccharine 
flash of modern life. It also builds 
to a revenge-fueled climax that 
rivals the genre’s best. Sigoruney 
Weaver’s (“Alien”) Ellen Ripley 
has a modern sister in Monáe’s 
Veronica Henley. 

It’s past time horror was taken 

seriously, 
because, 
in 
recent 

memory, has the world ever been so 
horrible? Racist terror haunts the 
headlines every single day. Movies 
must hit it head on, and why should 
horror movies be excluded? Genre 
shouldn’t determine a film’s value 
— quality should.

Ann Arbor comedians find 
creative ways to perform

Movie theaters: Closed.
Music festivals: Canceled. 
Broadway: Dark.
Comedy clubs: Still figuring it 

out. Well, at least the comedians 
are.

Over the past few months, live 

performance venues across the 
world have taken a back seat in 
the interest of public health. In 
the state of Michigan, there have 
been virtually no changes in hopes 
of reopening local entertainment 
hotspots. 
Since 
Governor 

Whitmer’s first executive order of 
the pandemic, Ann Arbor Comedy 
Showcase, Ann Arbor’s premier 
comedy establishment, has had 
its doors locked. Its website, 
practically untouched since mid-
March, serves as an eerie reminder 
of how abruptly American life 
changed. Atop the site’s masthead, 
an ironically cruel business slogan: 
“Laughter is the best medicine … 
come get the cure!” 

With the largest source for 

stand-up in Ann Arbor closed 
for 
live 
shows, 
many 
local 

comedians have found themselves 
in a bewildering months-long 
limbo. Andrew Yang, a master of 
ceremonies for the showcase, lives 
in Milford, and has been doing 
stand-up in Ann Arbor for close to 
five years. 

“[The 
showcase] 
is 
doing 

Facebook live shows,” Yang said in 

an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “There’s no audience. It’s 
just the comics that are there on 
stage and then they broadcast it on 
Facebook.” 

Typically, the showcase hosts 

a traditional open mic every 
Wednesday 
night, 
but 
now, 

comedians like Yang are searching 
for creative ways to pivot their 
comedy in the COVID-19 era. 

“I know the comics are trying to 

adapt. A lot of us are trying to put 
on outdoor shows. There’s some 
venues that are open, where comics 
have to wear masks — there’s 
others that are unregulated, but 
those are shows I wouldn’t have 
done in the first place,” Yang said. 
“Basically with being indoors and 
performing, I’d feel unsafe.”

Yang’s concerns regarding the 

overall safety of live performances 
appear 
to 
be 
a 
common 

sentiment 
shared 
throughout 

Ann Arbor’s comedy collective. 
As a community, the Ann Arbor 
comedy scene reflects some of the 
best that the Midwest has to offer. 
As a hub, Ann Arbor comedians 
come from all over — with large 
shares from Detroit, Toledo and 
Chicago. 

However, 
comedy 
venues 

around 
the 
country 
are 

traditionally dark, claustrophobic 
and makeshift. Comedian Demetri 
Martin once joked that “the best 
rooms for comedy are the rooms 
that would be the worst in a fire.” 
A mixture of traveling comedians 
sharing 
cramped 
spaces 
and 

unsanitized microphones would 
easily signal some COVID red 
flags. So understandably, some 
comics have backed off from the 
spotlight.

“Some 
people 
have 
been 

quitting,” said Jacob Barr, a senior 
at Eastern Michigan and regular 
performer for the showcase. “For 
people at my level, it’s like an 
internship where I make some 
money doing it, but not enough to 
only do comedy. But the real issue 
is for the people right above me 
who are on the cusp on being able 
to do comedy as a career. I’ve had 
multiple who just started getting 
their bodies into the water, and 
then the pandemic hits and they 
have to go back to their day job.” 

Typically, a comedy club will 

split a fraction of the money 
from tickets sold at the door with 
performers, and other income is 
supplemented by selling food and 
beverage. With no live crowds, or 
even significantly reduced crowds, 
that income dramatically lessens. 
Barr confesses, “It’s been really 
discouraging for a lot of comedians 
I know to not be able to do what 
they love.”

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
comedy 

showcase has made no public 
statements 
about 
when 
they 

plan to fully reopen, or to reopen 
in a limited capacity. However, 
ongoing 
conversations 
suggest 

that Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase 
plans to reopen their doors as soon 
as possible. 

“The showcase can sit three-

hundred 
people,” 
Barr 
says, 

“They’re remodeling the front 
lobby, so they clearly have plans 
to stay open.” The showcase 
relocated to its present location 
at 212 S. Fourth Ave in 2014, and 
had already been under significant 
exterior renovations for the past 
year. 

Brady Keene, a junior at Wayne 

State University and recurring 
comic for the showcase, told 
The 
Daily 
he 
had 
thoughts 

about the possibility for outdoor 
performances 
before 
winter 

weather sets in. “I also thought 
about doing a Zoom show, and 
donating the proceeds to charity.” 
The challenge of outdoor and 
Zoom-related 
performances, 

many comedians admit, is the 
degree to which intimacy and 
volume 
can 
translate 
jokes 

effectively 
to 
their 
audience. 

In particular, TV critics have 

highlighted 
late-night 
comedy 

shows’ challenges to fully resonate 
their jokes with the absence of a 
live audience. But in an era when 
health rightfully takes precedence 
over humor, Keene is hopeful this 
will only be a bump in the road.

“Especially 
in 
comedy,” 

Keene said, “any tragic thing 
that happens, over time, turns 
funny. I have a stand-up bit about 
the Salem witch trials. Was it 
funny back then? Absolutely not. 
But now? You can turn it into 
something hilarious. So I’m very 
excited to hear all the takes about 
the ignorant people once we get 
back to regular work.”

As comics from all ranges of 

experience clamor to return to 
clubs, comedians like Andrew 
Yang and Jacob Barr are already 
working to put on an outdoor 
show at Bløm Meadworks while 
maintaining Washtenaw County 

safety guidelines. 

“We’re already sold out for this 

Friday, and we’re expecting about 
25 people outside,” Yang said. “All 
the comics will be really rusty, and 
it will take a while for people to 
feel comfortable.”

While 
the 
pandemic 
will 

have certainly made it harder 
to workshop jokes and create a 
solid stand-up routine, the love 
for the craft still exists for many 
Michigan comics. “I would love 
to do terrible open mics and bomb 
constantly if it meant I could do 
comedy the same as before,” Barr 
said. For many Ann Arbor comics, 
they can’t wait to return to “the 
best club in Michigan.”

I found my own answer 
to John Cusack’s question

In the opening scene of the 

2000 film “High Fidelity,” John 
Cusack’s Rob Gordon says in 
a close-up shot to the camera, 
“What came first, the music or 
the misery?” He elaborates on 
this rhetorical: “Nobody worries 
about kids listening to thousands, 
literally 
thousands 
of 
songs 

about heartbreak, rejection, pain, 
misery and loss. Did I listen to pop 
music because I was miserable? 
Or was I miserable because I 
listened to pop music?” 

I watched “High Fidelity” 

in the front row of a darkened 
basement 
classroom 
at 
my 

previous college, allowing myself 
to be swept away by the movie’s 
wit and charm. I witnessed 
hilarious music snobs and friends 
of Rob, Barry and Dick capture 
the 
experience 
of 
browsing 

record stores on Saturdays.

While the movie sat stored in 

my filing cabinet of art inspiration, 
the movie’s opening lines recently 
jumped back to the front of my 
consciousness. Studying in my 
childhood bedroom brought me 
back to who I used to be and how 
depression became a part of my 
daily routine, an extra baggage 
to haul along, something I was 
unprepared to carry with me. 
I reentered a middle and high 
school frame of mind. I made 
a Spotify playlist of Paramore, 
Fall Out Boy, My Chemical 
Romance and Weezer. I began 
reading “Wuthering Heights,” an 
infamously polarizing Victorian 
novel of two people driven apart 
by passion and misunderstanding 
that results in tragedy and loss. 

The classic had been glaring at 
me from its lofty perch on my 
bookshelf since high school. And, 
as any English major knows, 
there’s an acute guilt when it 
comes to not having read a classic. 
So, with Rob Gordon’s question in 
mind, I gave in to my misery and 
embraced the emo.

As someone with depression, 

I’ve been told to listen to uplifting 
music and read inspiring self-help 
books or memoirs. I’ve been told 
to watch movies with hopeful 
endings. I’ve been told to drink 
chamomile tea before bed. I’ve 
been told to conjure happier 
thoughts. And yet, none of these 
antidotes have cured me.

Heading to Goodwill this 

weekend, my friends and I 
listened to music and I brought up 
the question of which came first: 
the music or the misery? The 
consensus from this collection 
of 
pandemic-weary, 
(some) 

mentally ill Gen Z students was 
that misery arrived first. Then, 
came the tendency to consume 
more morose art. I found my 
experiences 
matched 
this 

conclusion: We acquire art that 
understands, or even matches, 
our current emotional turmoil. 

Sometimes these supposedly 

uplifting books or movies do 
help. While I read Brené Brown’s 
“Daring Greatly” and can attest 
to its powerful mindshift changes 
and advice, I can’t quote Brené 
Brown. But, I know the lyrics 
to The Smiths and Car Seat 
Headrest songs that made me 
feel less alone. Maybe Brown’s 
words helped for a few weeks 
after reading the book, but those 
lyrics seized my soul and shook 
me into a realization that others 
have felt this way and still found a 

way to forge something beautiful 
out of it.

In another scene from “High 

Fidelity,” Rob tells his friend that 
he’s arranging his records not 
chronologically or alphabetically, 
but autobiographically. I’ve found 
similar experiences with my own 
misery period of music and books.

Emily Dickinson’s collected 

poems whispered aloud in my 
childhood bedroom, a gift from 
my brother for my eighteenth 
birthday. 
Her 
sweeping 

existential queries in light of 
observing a frog croak cradled me 
during a particularly debilitating 
bout of depression — a general 
inability to find reason to brush 
my teeth, clean the dishes or feel 
the sun on my skin again.

Car Seat Headrest’s 2016 Teens 

of Denial was my soundtrack 
for riding the bus on a weary 
afternoon after class, watching 
the light filter in through the 
fingerprint-smudged 
windows 

freshman year of college. In 2018, 
“Catcher in the Rye’s” Holden 
Caulfield accompanied me on 
a break from school during a 
challenging winter. I walked 
with Catherine and Heathcliff 
through the rainy moors and 
muddy paths when the pandemic 
brought me home from Michigan. 
However typical, it’s no wonder 
young adults gravitate towards 
the somber. Especially during a 
pandemic where particular life 
events or experiences have been 
snatched away, we wallow. Even 
before this unprecedented global 
health crisis, Gen Z has wrestled 
with declining rates of mental 
health.

I

n his article for Geo-
graphical Review, geog-
rapher Blake Gumprecht 

posits the American college town 
as “a place apart, a unique type of 
urban community shaped by the 
sometimes conflicting forces of 
youth, intellect and idealism that 
have been a critical but underap-
preciated part of American life.” 

I have a hard time agreeing 

with the second part; the image 
of a youthful, crafty, idealistic 
American is practically a ste-
reotype in my book. As for the 
idea that college towns present 
a unique set of questions to the 
geographically-minded 
person, 

that is something I can get be-
hind. 

It should be no surprise that 

Gumprecht talks about Ann Ar-
bor in his article. He writes about 
the leafy neighborhoods, the pro-
liferation of bookstores all within 
walking distance of each other 
and the effort to launch a “re-
search park” just outside the city 
in the early 1960s.

Since arriving here from my 

home of Washington, D.C., it has 
been a privilege to learn about 
the geography of Ann Arbor 
throughout my years at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. I have always en-
joyed exploring the town on long walks from 
Central Campus to far-flung locations like 
the Eberwhite Nature Area, Bandemer Park 
and even the Matthaei Botanical Gardens. 

One day, however, as I was walking across 

East Huron Street toward the Diag, it oc-
curred to me that I was crossing a border. Of 
course, there were no signs or immigration 
officials to stamp my passport as I left the 
off-campus world and stepped back on Uni-
versity property. It was a crossing I had made 
many times before, but this time I thought 
about it geographically. 

According to the National Geographic So-

ciety, geography is “the study of places and 
the relationships between people and their 
environments.” In other words, geography is 
more than just people fiddling around with 
maps; it is a way of seeing the world that em-
phasizes how the spaces where we live shape 
us, and how we, in turn, shape them.

This article, then, is one student’s attempt 

to think about Ann Arbor geographically. 
To me this is a fascinating subject, but also 
a serious one. Growing up in Washington, 
D.C., I formed ties with both the people and 
the land that will last for my entire life. The 
physical spaces of the city — the streets on 
which I walked to school, the parks where I 
played as a child and the buildings that kept 
me warm — are always with me, even when 
I am not there. 
T

he first issue is to demarcate the 
boundaries of the University’s 
Central Campus. State Street, from 

the Ford School all the way to the corner of 
the Diag, forms the western border. Many 
landmarks populate this busy thoroughfare, 
including the Law School, Angell Hall and 
the newly-renovated Michigan Union.

On the eastern border, the University has 

respected the border of South Forest but 
pressed as far as possible into the northeast 
corridor with its dormitories and health 
system. The Mary Markley Residence Hall, 
for example, is on the doorstep of the Nich-
ols Arboretum, whereas the hospital enjoys 
sprawling views of the Huron River.

The northern and southern borders, how-

ever, are a different case. To the north, East 
Huron Street provides a substantial buffer 
between town and gown. The majority of 
cool bars and restaurants are further down, 
so it is not a place frequented by under-
graduates, and further west, the architec-
ture devolves into an unsettling mix of lavish 
high-rise apartments and austere industrial 
buildings. 

Hill Street, however, has quite a different 

feel from its northern counterpart. It is clos-
er to popular study spots such as the Ross 
School of Business and the Law Quad. In the 
evenings — even, unfortunately, in the mid-
dle of a pandemic — Hill Street comes alive 
with throngs of people going to and from 
the bars on South University Avenue and the 
many fraternity houses.

Now, there are lots of examples of Uni-

versity buildings that fall outside of this neat 
geographical abstraction. To make things 
more concrete, imagine our campus as a pip-
ing hot Reuben sandwich from Zingerman’s 
Delicatessen, where the two slices of rye 
bread represent East Huron and Hill streets; 
yes, there are little pieces of sauerkraut and 
corned beef that fall off the sides, but right in 
between those two slices is where the action 
happens.
S

peaking of Zingerman’s, I will now 
shift my focus to one of the most 
well-known 
northern 
neighbor-

hoods in Ann Arbor: Kerrytown. 

The boundaries of Kerrytown were con-

sistent across practically every map I con-
sulted and every person I asked: Depot 
Street to the north, South Division Street to 
the east, East Huron Street to the south and 
South Main to the west.

When looking at historical maps of Ann 

Arbor, I was surprised to find that the area 
surrounding modern-day Kerrytown was 
for a long time the densest part of town. One 
surveyor’s map from 1854 clearly shows that 
most of the occupied lots at the time were 
located on the western side of the town be-
tween Second and Fifth streets. Off to the 
east sits a lonely square titled “Michigan 
State University” (University of Michigan li-
brarians assure us that this was an error on 
the part of the surveyor). 

Though a casual observer may not notice 

it, there are pieces of history hiding in plain 
sight all over Kerrytown. To explore this his-
tory, I talked on the phone with Grace Sin-
gleton, a managing partner of Zingerman’s, 
who informed me of just one such piece of 
local lore. 

“The Kerrytown district is interesting. 

Where the deli is is actually where the origi-
nal plaque for the city was located,” Single-
ton said. “When Ann Arbor became a city, 
Kerrytown is kind of where the downtown 
was. (Zingerman’s) was one of the first build-
ings, so it’s all historic.”

In addition to the historic value of the 

neighborhood, Kerrytown is also known for 
its diverse cultural and artistic offerings. In a 
typical non-pandemic year, there are numer-
ous festivals, including the Kerrytown Book-
fest, the Ann Arbor African American Down-
town Festival and Edgefest, which is hosted 
at the Kerrytown Concert House. Thankfully, 
the weekly gathering of the Ann Arbor Farm-
ers Market has only been partially disrupted 
by pandemic conditions. People can still 
shop for fresh produce and interact with the 
growers, though social distancing guidelines 
necessarily limit the scope of these interac-
tions. In our interview, Singleton expressed 
her admiration for this mix of activities.

“There’s little pockets of residential inter-

spersed with all these shops, and I just think 
it makes it a really unique, diverse area,” 
Singleton said. “There are also still a lot of 
shops where people live above them. And 

there’s museums and venues for music and 
shopping, and all that. But then there’s like 
residents right next door.” 

There are a lot of undergraduates who 

live in the area, but Kerrytown is also a popu-
lar neighborhood for graduate students and 
young professionals. I talked with Tasha 
Thong, a third-year PhD candidate at the 
School of Public Health and Chelsea Rich-
ards, who works for Michigan Medicine.

Thong had lived on Geddes Avenue on the 

east side of campus while completing her 
Master’s degree at the University (though 
she was clear that she much preferred Ker-
rytown, saying, “I have lived in other places 
in Ann Arbor and this is definitely my favor-
ite by far.”) 

Richards, on the other hand, said she 

had recently moved to Ann Arbor. Her fa-
vorite part about Kerrytown was having 
access to the various natural surroundings. 

“I love that you can walk to the river 

and there’s a nature trail that goes along 
it where you can easily get on the Border-
to-Border trailhead to bike,” Richards ex-
plained. In fact, if you look at a map of Ann 
Arbor, there is a much larger concentration 
of greenery on the northern edges, close to 
the Huron River, when compared to South 
Campus. 

When I asked them about their percep-

tions of the south side of campus, they re-
ferred to its inhabitants as “the younger 
crowd.” And I think for the most part, they 
are correct. Though as I will soon explain, 
the southern side of campus also exhibits 
diversity of ages, albeit of a much more 
pronounced range. 
I

f you ask the average undergradu-
ate what lies below Hill Street, they 
would probably talk about the pre-

dominantly student-populated streets of 
Church, Greenwood, Oakland, etc. These 
pockets of student life are scrunched up 
in the corner underneath State and Hill 
streets, though they border a much more 
established neighborhood called Burns 
Park. 

I did not talk about the borders of Ker-

rytown because all the available maps I con-
sulted and the residents I talked to offered 
the same streets. Burns Park, on the other 
hand, is a bit of a mystery.

My belief is that Google Maps’s outline of 

Burns Park is just plain wrong. For some rea-
son, it includes areas east of Washtenaw Av-
enue inside its boundaries of the neighbor-
hood, including a section much further east 
which is completely cut off from the rest. 
Even the Diag is a part of Burns Park accord-
ing to the Google folks out in Silicon Valley.

The most inclusive definition of Burns 

Park that still retains a semblance of accu-
racy has Hill Street as a northern border, 
Washtenaw Avenue as an eastern border, 
East Stadium Boulevard as a southern border 
and State Street as a western border. When I 
interviewed Dr. Gorman Beauchamp, a for-

mer professor of literature in the 
English department at the Uni-
versity, this was the definition we 
agreed upon as a starting point 
for the discussion.

In 1995, Beauchamp pub-

lished an article in The American 
Scholar titled “Dissing the Mid-
dle Class: The View from Burns 
Park.” Beauchamp first moved to 
Ann Arbor in 1965 as an under-
graduate and has lived in various 
locations around the city. In the 
article, Beauchamp examines the 
psychology of his neighbors in 
the predominantly middle-class, 
family-oriented neighborhood of 
Burns Park. He explores the ten-
sion and guilt that avowed liber-
als like him held for the “crass 
materialism of their bourgeois 
existence,” even as they contin-
ued to reap the material benefits 
of middle class life. Beauchamp 
writes in his article, “the truest 
statement that ever heard about 
my estimable neighborhood was 
uttered by a colleague in the Eng-
lish Department: ‘Ah yes, Burns 
Park — where they vote left and 
live right.’” 

I followed up with Beau-

champ, who still lives in the 
neighborhood, to ask a few ques-

tions about the view from the Burns 

Park in 2020. The area is still home to many 
faculty and administration, and though 
Burns Park does not lend itself to a catchy 
demonym, Beauchamp said that residents 
still exhibit a self-identification with the 
neighborhood itself.

“Burns Park very much has a kind of self-

identification,” Beauchamp said. “But about 
other places, I really couldn’t speak. I think 
all of them have names in the real estate busi-
ness. They’ll have a house identifying what 
part of town it’s in by a particular name, but I 
don’t know how much those things translate 
into real consciousness for people who live 
in those areas.”

I think this is a major difference between 

local residents and college students who 
live south of Hill Street. The focal point of 
the Burns Park neighborhood is the sprawl-
ing park and elementary school of the same 
name. “The one thing in Burns Park, of 
course, is the elementary school,” Beau-
champ explained. “Very highly rated, so 
parents with young children will move into 
Burns Park because that’s where they want 
them to go to school.”

Thus, it is easy to see why local parents 

and children would self-identify with the 
neighborhood, whereas college students 
might not. The children spend a majority of 
their youth playing in the park and going to 
school, and the parents bond over their chil-
dren’s experiences. For these reasons, the 
park draws in the local crowd much more 
easily than the college crowd.

For college students, the feeling is mutual. 

I spoke with Jacob Feuerborn, a recent grad-
uate of the Ross School of Business who lived 
on Greenwood Avenue, a mere five blocks 
from Burns Park Elementary School. Feuer-
born loved his experience living on Green-
wood, but was unfamiliar with the name of 
Burns Park.

“Oh, which one is Burns Park? Is that the 

one by Jack’s Hardware?” Feuerborn asked 
(that’s Forsythe Park). After a quick Google 
search, he said he had actually seen the park 
before.

“Ah, now I can see which one is Burns 

Park,” Feuerborn said. “It’s interesting that 
it’s considered the same neighborhood. I 
would say there’s a big spectrum, where 
down there it very much feels like a normal 
suburb, whereas Greenwood, Oakland and 
streets like that feel a lot crazier. A lot more 
college.”

In fact, the existence of student neighbor-

hoods in the middle of the neighborhood 
has seemingly fragmented Burns Park into 
two separate Burns Parks: Lower Burns Park 
and North Burns Park. These are much more 
fiercely family-oriented areas; what some 
might call the real Burns Park.

Ann Arbor and the University of 
Michigan: a geography

L

ate in the evening of the Jewish 

New Year Rosh Hashanah on Sept. 

18, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 

passed away from complications related to 

pancreatic cancer. 

Upon hearing the news of her passing, it 

is understandable why so many responded 

with punditry on the upcoming battle over 

her replacement on the Supreme Court of the 

United States and its intersection with the 

upcoming election on Nov. 3. Recognizing the 

possibility that Trump could appoint a nomi-

nee to tip the balance of the Supreme Court 

to a 6-3 conservative majority, Ginsburg said 

just days before her death, “My most fervent 

wish is that I will not be replaced until a new 

president is installed.”

Of course, some have criticized her for 

years about refusing to step down while Presi-

dent Barack Obama, along with the Demo-

cratic-controlled Senate, could appoint her 

successor before the 2014 midterm elections. 

Nodding toward the increasingly partisan na-

ture of Senate confirmation votes since her 

own 96-3 confirmation in 1993, she often re-

sponded with the argument: “anybody who 

thinks that if I step down, Obama could ap-

point someone like me, they’re misguided.” 

To carry out her final wish, there is so 

much of all us can do — donating to Senate 

candidates in swing states, making sure our 

friends have requested their absentee ballots 

or phone banking for the Biden-Harris cam-

paign to turn out the vote, to name a few. Here, 

though, I want to take a moment to appreciate 

the legacy of her life, work and jurisprudence.

Ginsburg was a trailblazer, especially so for 

women, but also for men — many of the cases 

she argued involved male clients who claimed 

damages as a result of laws written based on 

traditional gender roles. In Weinberger v. Wi-

esenfeld (1975), Ginsburg successfully argued 

on behalf of her male client who had been de-

nied Social Security benefits because he was 

a man and the law only provided benefits for 

widows who were the sole caregiver of their 

child. 

As a professor and founder of the Ameri-

can Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights 

Project, Ginsburg helped establish the first 

case law that extended the Fourteenth 

Amendment’s equal protection clause to pro-

tect women from discrimination on the basis 
of sex in Reed v. Reed (1971). Indicative of 

her place in a long line of women who fought 

for women’s legal rights, she credited Doro-

thy Kenyon and Pauli Murray as co-authors 

of the case’s brief in acknowledgment of the 

work they had done in laying the foundation 

for legal protections for women. 

Ginsburg’s unique approach of expanding 

legal rights for women by taking on laws that 

also hurt men didn’t end there. Disagreeing 

with many feminists at the time, she took 

issue with the legal basis of the rule estab-

lished in Roe v. Wade (1973). Instead of bas-

ing abortion rights on the right to privacy as 

included in the Tenth Amendment’s penum-

bras, Ginsburg believed the case should have 

been argued on the basis she helped establish 

in Reed. Specifically, she argued that laws 

criminalizing abortion violated the Four-

teenth Amendment’s equal protection clause 

because they discriminated on the basis of 

sex, meaning they should be subjected to a 

strict scrutiny review by the Court. Under 

this heightened and more stringent review, 

she believed, laws banning abortion would 

almost certainly be struck down. 

Throughout her career and her work as 

the second woman to serve on the Supreme 

Court, Ginsburg helped establish legal rights 

for women that seem basic now but were 

quite revolutionary in the late 20th century. 

Women today owe the following rights in 

part to her work: the right to sign a mortgage 

without a male co-signer, the right to open a 

bank account without a male co-signer, the 

right to pursue redress if employers discrimi-

nate on the basis of sex, be employed without 

being discriminated against based on gender 

and the right to be employed while pregnant 

and caring for children.

Her work paved the way for these funda-

mental rights, but it was the way she lived her 

life that paved the way for generations of fe-

male lawyers, judges and justices beyond her. 

Her jurisprudence became so influential that 

she was nicknamed the “Notorious RBG” by 

NYU Law student Shana Knizhnik for her 

powerful dissent in Shelby County v. Holder 

(2013) after pointing out the absurdity of 

Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion.

As the nickname was popularized and 

plastered on tote bags and mugs, the meme-

ification of Ginsburg took on a life of its own. 

Kate McKinnon even portrayed her on “Sat-

urday Night Live” but after seeing the video, 

Indie Wire reported that Ginsburg found “the 

comedian ‘marvelously funny, even if the im-

pression resembles her ‘not one bit.’” In fact, 

many, including her longtime friend and law 

professor Jeffrey Rosen, at first find her “aus-

tere” and mistake her silence for “inaccessibil-

ity.” 

Her warmth and care for others, however, 

is evident in the way she thought about the 

law. She saw her work as building toward 

a more “embracive” Constitution, one that 

eagerly welcomes previously marginalized 

groups — women, people of color, queer peo-

ple, etc. — in order to fulfill the promise made 

by the Framers of the Constitution in 1787. For 

a woman to set out to fundamentally change 

the role of the Constitution to protect vulner-

able people as she did in the 1970s was quite 

literally revolutionary. 

She believed so deeply in this mission that 

even her personal life became dedicated to 

working toward her vision of justice; her fa-

mously-egalitarian relationship with her hus-

band, Marty Ginsburg, was aptly summed up 

as one in which “(Marty) did the cooking and 

she did the writing and he picked up the kids 

from school and she did the writing. And, you 

know, he went to the meetings when the kids 

were bad and she did the writing.” 

In my own life, Ginsburg has served as a 

guiding light throughout my decision to pur-

sue law school. Applying to law school, which 

I have been doing for the last six months, is a 

notoriously difficult and exhausting process. 
Studying for the Law School Admission Test 

(LSAT) alone is a huge undertaking. I’ve of-

ten turned to rewatching “RBG,” the docu-

mentary of her life or “On the Basis of Sex,” a 

biopic of her early sex discrimination work. I 

referred to reading my favorite passages of “In 

My Own Words,” a book-length compilation 

of her speeches and writings, for inspiration 

to continue on.

For all of us, Ginsburg’s death is a painful 

reminder of how much work there is left to be 

done. Women have not yet experienced gen-

der equality in the U.S., and progress toward 

that end is likely to be dismantled by a 6-3 

conservative Supreme Court if Donald Trump 

and Mitch McConnell succeed in stealing an-

other seat on the bench without regard to the 

outcome of the election in November. With 

a case about the Affordable Care Act sched-

uled for arguments a week after the election 

and Republicans gunning to overturn Roe v. 

Wade outright, along with other cases that 

guarantee civil and voting rights, the need for 

feminist lawyers is perhaps more exigent than 

ever, and alongside all of the women before 

me, I plan to follow in her footsteps. 

Her life and legacy mean I have the oppor-

tunity to pursue an independent life and ca-

reer in the law, working to advocate for wom-

en and other marginalized people. Her work 

is the foundation every feminist lawyer should 

strive to build upon, and even in death, Gins-

burg continues to be a trailblazer: On Sept. 25, 

she became the first woman to lie in state at 

the U.S. Capitol in our nation’s history. 

May her memory be a revolution.

DEPUTY EDITOR

Two Tributes: On RBG and her legacy

T

here’s nothing more disorient-

ing than waking up from a dream 

that feels like real life. As my eyes 

opened from figurative to literal darkness, 

sweat dripping down my chest, I counted 

heartbeats to calm my rapid breathing.

In for six, out for four.

I grabbed my sheets in my left hand, my 

stuffed animal (one of ten) in my right in an 

unsuccessful attempt to ground myself in re-

ality. Nothing was working — the nightmare I 

just endured felt all too real. 

It was sometime in the distant future, the 

world filled with gray colors and dreary un-

dertones. I was dressed in a strangely famil-

iar red cloak — one that I had seen before, 

but couldn’t exactly remember where from. 

I raised my eyes from focusing on myself 

and turned to the society around me. I saw 

women dressed in this piercing red cloak 

everywhere in a uniform manner. Sud-

denly, it hit me. I had seen this off-putting 

environment before: it was the dystopian 

framework of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” As 

the world around me morphed into one by 

defined extreme fascism and a lack of au-

tonomy, I felt my stomach drop. The gut-

wrenching feeling triggered my conscious-

ness and pulled me back into the familiar 

setting of my room.

Under normal circumstances, I could’ve 

easily dismissed this dream as a distorted 

fluke of my wildest imagination and car-

ried on with my night. This wasn’t a normal 

night. It was hours after the passing of the 

revered Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 

Ginsburg. My nightmare was a projection of 

my anxiety from Sen. Mitch McConnell’s in-

sensitive, opportunistic response to replace 

her seat just a few short hours after her 

death was announced. It not only scared but 

deeply disheartened me that we, the collec-

tive, let the fate of the U.S. fall on the shoul-

ders of an 87-year-old woman — a giant not 

only fighting her country’s political battles 

but her own medical obstacles as well. 

She deserved better than the reaction of 

horrified citizens plagued with crippling 

fear. She deserved to be celebrated and hon-

ored for everything she had done for us. 

And in order to mitigate my personal anxi-

ety, whether it be manifested in a dream or 

in everyday thoughts, I am attempting to 

channel my sorrow in a more productive 

way — one more fitting of the beautiful life 

she lived. Here’s to you, RBG. 
R

BG set the path for my life since I 

first learned of who she was. I was 

introduced to her in my eighth-

grade history class when learning about the 

Supreme Court. Though her story wasn’t told 

in its entirety, she was described as the sec-

ond female-appointed Supreme Court justice 

in the history of the U.S. — a trailblazer and 

champion for women’s rights. I was fascinat-

ed by her with just that description.

As I independently researched after school 

that day, I learned more about her upbringing 

and career. She was a Jewish woman from 

Brooklyn — a background that mirrored my 

own, as a Jewish girl from New Jersey — con-

stantly challenged by male peers who did not 

want her to succeed. Yet she succeeded any-

way, and she did it impeccably. She was one of 

only nine women in her year at Harvard Law 

School, and successfully maintained the posi-

tion as first in her class. Despite this incredibly 

impressive standing, she was denied from 12 

law firms following her graduation. She per-

severed and trusted her intellect, working as 

first a clerk for a law firm, then a professor and 

eventually, became the creator of the ACLU 

Women’s Project. 

During her time at the ACLU, RBG fought 

for gender equality in now considered land-

mark Supreme Court cases such as Frontiero 

v. Richardson, in which a precedent was es-
tablished to hold gender to higher scrutiny 

than the rational basis standard. She also 

argued for gender equality in Weinberger v. 

Wiesenfeld, in which she used an instance of 

gender discrimination against a man to help 

further establish precedents for future cases. 

RBG continued dismantling once normalized 

discriminatory gender practices throughout 

her career, arguing cases with an unparal-

leled eloquence, and landing her a seat on 

the Supreme Court with a 96-3 confirmation 

vote. 

She is the reason I can independently man-

age and spend my earnings without male con-

sent. She is the reason I can independently 

seek and own housing without male consent. 

She is the reason I cannot be denied employ-

ment based on gender. She is the reason I 

cannot be fired for being pregnant or having 

a child. 

Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the direct and 

sole catalyst for so much progress this country 

has made.

The more I learned, the more I was in-

spired to follow in her footsteps. She be-

came the voice in my head; somewhat of 

a guardian angel guiding me in what aca-

demic steps to take and career decisions to 

make. 

I became focused on studying govern-

ment and political science, with hopes of 

going to law school — I geared my entire 

undergraduate college application toward 

that goal. I joined a pre-law organization 

because of her. I plastered pictures and 

RBG paraphernalia all over my room — like 

my Ginsburg socks, a calendar, a mug, three 

separate posters, a pillow and a desk plate 

that read “Do all the things with the confi-
dence of Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting.” 

I saw every movie or TV feature about her. 

I couldn’t believe it when I found out 

she passed away. It breaks my heart think-

ing about it. And while I mourn, I find 

strength in knowing that she never gave up. 

She worked tirelessly, without complain-

ing, until her final moments. RBG knew 

what she believed in; she had a strong 

moral compass, and it was her dying wish 

to protect that. So, now I ask myself, what 

more can I do to follow in her footsteps? 

How can I fight for positive change in the 

world? 

Thirty minutes after I woke up from my 

far-too-real nightmare, I lay staring at the ceil-

ing, tearful in RBG’s honor — for her life, for 

her legacy, for all she left behind for us to pick 

up. With this in mind, I remember how much 

there still needs to be done. I remember her 

spirit of perseverance, and how she continued 

to hold her head high against all odds. And 

while the odds appear intimidating, that’s all 

the more reason to continue pushing forward: 
Continue signing petitions, writing letters to 

government officials, calling local and nation-

al representatives, registering people to vote, 

studying law, protesting in the streets for what 

is right. If anything, we must do it for her. 

Taking a deep breath, I let one more tear 

roll down my face. I closed my eyes, slowly 

falling back to sleep, seeking solace in the fact 

that while I may cry now, I will rally tomor-

row.

A lesson from past 
pandemics

BY WILLA HART, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

L

ast week, in one of my history classes, Sick-

ness and Health Since 1492, I was assigned 

the reading “The Cholera Years” by Charles 

E. Rosenberg. The book is a dense, nearly 300-page 

account of the United States cholera epidemics of the 

1800s; the syllabus had us reading all but one chapter. 

I flipped through the pages of endless paragraphs and 

resigned myself to a Saturday unfortunately spent.

Then I started reading the book. Within the first 

30 pages, I found myself unexpectedly sucked in by 

Rosenberg’s description of a cholera-stricken New 

York. “By the end of the first week in July (in 1832),” 

Rosenberg writes, a few days after the city’s first chol-

era cases were confirmed, “almost everyone who could 
afford to had left the city. Farm houses and country 

homes within a thirty-mile radius were completely 

filled ... Visitors to the city were struck by the deathly 

silence of the streets, unaccustomedly clean.” I read 

this paragraph, then read it again. I felt as though I 

was reading an account of New York during the CO-

VID-19 outbreak. Vividly, I was reminded of the pho-

tos that had circulated the internet in the early days 

of COVID-19 in March 2020, images of a Times Square 

gone quiet and empty of tourists. 

The similarities didn’t stop there. Throughout the 

rest of his book, Rosenberg proceeded to outline the 

terror New Yorkers faced with cholera, their new ob-

session with cleanliness and how cholera dispropor-

tionately affected poor populations. His descriptions 

felt strangely prescient to me, the commentary almost 

uncomfortably familiar. For all our differences and 

scientific evolutions, the cholera outbreak in the 1830s 

had many outwardly similar social effects to the pan-

demic we face today.
W

hen I decided to declare a Minor in Sci-

ence, Technology and Society with a 

concentration in medicine, I didn’t think 

it would ever be particularly useful for me. It was an 

interesting field of study, I thought, and offered an ex-

cuse to take classes across a range of disciplines; that 

was enough to convince me to sign up. As a Philosophy 

major, I’d already thrown practicality to the window. 

What’s five more indulgent humanities courses before 

I graduate?

When COVID-19 hit, I was taking one of those indul-

gent classes: AIDS and Other Health Crises. It didn’t 

take long for me to realize, after I returned home, that 

my education had already uniquely prepared me to un-

derstand and discuss COVID-19. Not to say I was an 

expert, only that I alone among my family had previ-

ously learned about the concepts that news anchors 

were now discussing on TV, and so I was most easily 

able to explain them. I talked my dad through “flat-

tening the curve” and explained to my mom the differ-

ence between quarantine and isolation. I told my sister 

about the basics of making flu vaccines. 

It felt like a stroke of luck, then, that I had cho-

sen the minor I did. Even if everything else was going 

wrong, I thought, at least I was getting some use out of 

my education.

It’s only over the past few weeks that I’ve realized 

just how valuable my education really is. 

I’m taking the bulk of the classes for my minor 

this semester, and the more I read about the history 

of medicine, the more I realize that everything we’re 

experiencing now, as both individuals and as a soci-

ety, has been experienced by others before. In other 

words, we are not alone in history. 

It’s a notion I find incredibly comforting, even if 

it’s one not necessarily often spoken about. We usually 

prefer to frame the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of 

novelty — just think about how often you’ve heard the 

term “unprecedented” in the last six months. And in 

some ways, COVID-19 definitely is unprecedented: It’s 

a “novel” virus and the first serious global pandemic in 

decades. Still, novelty, for me, has become exhausting. 

As French philosopher Albert Camus writes in his 

novel “The Plague,” which chronicles a breakout of 

bubonic plague in an Algerian city, “Considering the 

abnormal conditions (the townsfolk) were up against, 

the very word ‘novelty’ had lost all its meaning.”

When I read this sentence last weekend as part of 

my weekly school readings, it hit me unexpectedly 

hard. I’m tired of being told what a unique position 

we’re in as a society. I’m tired of being told how crazy 

this all is. It’s not comforting anymore, if it ever was. I 

want things to be normal again. I want to not be afraid 

that these “unprecedented” times are going to turn out 

to be the apocalypse — because, as the world contin-

ues to crumble around us, it feels more and more likely 

that that’s exactly where we’re headed. 

In one of my classes last week, as we were wait-

ing for the last few students to join the Zoom call, my 

professor started talking about COVID-19 and the so-

called “college experience.” 

“People worry right now that they’re not getting 

their college experience,” he said, “But this is the most 

real college experience you could possibly have.”

The last student joined the Zoom, then, and my pro-

fessor moved on to discussing our readings, so I never 

got to hear his explanation for exactly what he meant 

by that. But I’ve been thinking about it for the past few 

days, and though I still don’t know precisely what he 

was getting at, I have my own interpretation of what 

he meant.

The college experience, as it’s sold to us, is largely 

artificial. It’s consumptive, revolving around frat par-

ties and football games, expensive dorm rooms and 

late-night study sessions. But that’s just one depic-

tion of the college experience. There’s another side 
of things which is perhaps less openly discussed, but 

which I believe is much more fundamental to one’s 

college years: the experience of becoming an adult.

Growing up is weird. It’s weird the first time you 

have to pay your own utility bills. It’s weird the first 

time you realize how expensive nice toilet paper is. It’s 

weird the first time you compare savings accounts to 

see which will get you a higher yield on your invest-

ment. And it’s weird the first time you face a national 

or global crisis. There’s something for every genera-

tion. For millennials, it was 9/11 and the Great Re-

cession; for us, it’s COVID-19. I wish it wasn’t. I wish 

this wasn’t happening, that people across the world 

weren’t dying from a disease that good leadership and 

social distancing should be able to limit, if not prevent. 

But this is happening, and people are dying, and we 

have to face the gravity of that.

It doesn’t matter how many people, historically or 

today, have experienced pandemics before: This pan-

demic is still painful. We can’t change or ignore that, 

and we shouldn’t try to. But at a time when the world 

feels uniquely unstable, it can also be reassuring to 

know that everything we’re experiencing, as indi-

viduals and a society, has been experienced by others 

before. Two hundred years before I was born, people 

were feeling and experiencing the same things I am 

right now, in a place not too far from here. Societies 

changed, cities slowed, friends and families were sep-

arated. And yet, eventually, they came back together 

again. The world survived. 

Knowing that doesn’t soften the tragedy we’re cur-

rently experiencing, but it does reassure me that, 

whatever this is, it probably isn’t the apocalypse.

Will Tschetter leads a simple life. 
He lives on his family farm in 

the rural outskirts of Stewartville, 
Minn., a community of roughly 
6,000 people. He doesn’t have social 
media. Basketball is his passion, 
but farm work comes first; he once 
instructed Juwan Howard to call 
him back so he could finish hauling 
the day’s load of rocks. 

Perhaps it’s fitting then that 

a mid-summer visit to an empty 
campus convinced Tschetter to 
commit to Michigan. 

“To be able to see the city of 

Ann Arbor and get the vibe of the 
campus in general was super cool,” 
Tschetter said. “It was weird, but 
also kind of like a normal visit.”

This past March, the COVID-19 

pandemic tilted the world of college 
basketball recruiting along its axis. 
The NCAA enacted a recruiting 
dead period on April 1, which 
has since been extended through 
December. In-person recruiting and 
official on-campus visits, the usual 
staples of a player’s recruitment, are 
forbidden. 

So Tschetter forged his own 

visit, making the nine-hour drive to 
Ann Arbor alongside his mom over 
Fourth of July weekend. Campus 
was barren, devoid of student life. 
They viewed buildings from the 
outside only. Howard and associate 
head coach Phil Martelli chimed in 
as de facto tour guides via FaceTime. 

Absent were the bells and 

whistles, like front-row seats at the 
Big House or a serenade at Crisler 
Center. But none of that mattered 
to Tschetter. He was sold, letting 
Howard know of his decision that 
Sunday night before announcing 
publicly the following day. 

Choosing 
Michigan 
marked 

the culmination of a whirlwind 

recruitment for Tschetter, one that 
saw him ascend from the depths 
of the unknown to the top of high-
major programs’ wishlists. 

Yet Tschetter’s rise comes as 

no surprise to those who have 
witnessed his talent firsthand. 

“You’d walk into an open gym 

and you’d watch him, all the tools, 
all the intangibles were there,” 
Brad Vaught, an assistant coach at 
Stewartville High School said. “I’ve 
coached DI power forwards and I 
felt like Will was a high-major kid.”

Vaught 
joined 
Stewartville’s 

staff last fall. At his prior gig — 
an assistant coaching position at 
Marshall High School in Rochester, 
Minn. — Vaught coached Matthew 
Hurt, a 6-foot-9 power forward 
who started 22 games last year as 
a freshman for Duke. Instantly, 
Vaught believed Hurt and Tschetter 
were comparable. 

The recruiting front, though, 

remained quiet. Tschetter held 
offers from South Dakota, Northern 
Iowa, Division II Augustana College 
and North Dakota State, his parents’ 
alma mater. Any high-major interest 
was muted. 

“I remember watching him play 

and thinking, ‘Hey, wait a minute, 
why doesn’t he have more offers?’ ” 
Vaught said. “That was my thought 
— Where is everybody?”

Last season, Tschetter shined. 

As a high school junior, he led 
the state of Minnesota in scoring, 
averaging 33.6 points per game to go 
along with 10.8 rebounds. Interest 
ticked up a bit — he added offers 
from Colorado State and Loyola-
Chicago — but not significantly. 
Programs were perhaps suspect of 
the competition level in Minnesota 
Class AA basketball and AAU 
tournaments that weren’t shoe-
sponsored. 

Tschetter 
and 
his 
parents 

compiled a highlight tape. Vaught 
surfed recruiting websites and 

contacted every Division I program 
whose information he could find, 
sending over the film via email. 
Willie Vang, Tschetter’s AAU coach 
on the Minnesota Heat, compiled all 
the information on a spreadsheet: 
who they contacted, who responded 
and who Tschetter had interest in. 

The proactive approach paid 

dividends. In April, Tschetter’s 
recruitment exploded. 

“Watching his skill on tape, go 

figure, schools started calling,” 
Adam Girtman, Tschetter’s head 
coach at Stewartville, said. “With 
the AAU season being shut down, 
schools started asking for tape 
and more tape. It just kind of 
snowballed.”

Offers poured in from mid-

majors throughout April. On May 
27, Arkansas became the first 
power-five program to extend an 
offer. Three Big Ten schools — 
Michigan, Nebraska and Minnesota 

— did the same on June 1. Virginia 
Tech, Iowa and Cincinnati followed 
suit soon after. 

Tschetter’s individual ranking 

soared as well, as he cracked the 
top 150 in 247Sports’ composite 
rankings for 2021 prospects. 

“All of a sudden, everyone started 

to say, ‘Oh wow, this kid’s 6-8, shoots 
45 percent from three, is strong 
as an ox,’ ” Vaught said. “When 
everybody started to see it, then it 
didn’t take much for people to want 
him to be a part of things.

“If you have the ability and the 

skillset, somebody’s gonna find 
you.”

This was all occurring, of course, 

amid the backdrop of the pandemic. 
Competition was shelved, high 
school seasons and AAU circuits 
truncated. There would be no more 
games for Tschetter to prove his 
worth, or for coaches to evaluate his 
talent in person. 

Recruiting 
too 
was 
flipped 

upside down, the industry moving 
entirely online almost overnight. 
Schools would have to find a way to 
sell themselves through a computer 
screen. 

Zoom calls quickly inundated 

Tschetter’s schedule: chats with 
coaches, 
film 
sessions, 
virtual 

campus tours. Out of all the schools 
in his pursuit, Tschetter says 
Michigan was “most consistent” 
in reaching out. Martelli led the 
charge, connecting with Tschetter 
on a daily basis. The rest of the 
staff — Howard, Saddi Washington 
and Howard Eisley — checked in 
weekly. 

“One 
of 
the 
things 
that 

separated 
Michigan 
was 
they 

did an unbelievable job of being 
organized,” 
Vang 
said. 
“With 

some of these schools they’ll just 
call and offer, and it’s kind of a 
brief phone call and you might 

not even hear from them for quite 
a while. Michigan had multiple 
conversations that were really long, 
really detailed.”

“The coaching staff and the 

culture that they’ve built really 
stood out,” Tschetter said. “They 
were really genuine throughout the 
process, super trustworthy.”

Tschetter’s commitment is a 

testament to Howard’s holistic 
recruiting style. With Tschetter, 
Michigan’s 
pitch 
extended 

beyond basketball, encompassing 
everything 
from 
a 
“Michigan 

college experience” to academics — 
a particularly important aspect for 
Tschetter, an honors student who 
holds a 3.99 GPA. 

“The neat thing about Juwan is 

he really kind of has the big picture 
in mind,” Vaught said. “He didn’t 
just see him as a player, but as a 
person.”

In terms of a basketball fit, 

Tschetter is what Vang calls “the 
definition of what basketball’s about 
now.” At 6-foot-8, 230 pounds, he 
punishes opponents inside and 
out, equipped with an array of 
post moves and a deadeye 3-point 
stroke. He runs a 4.6 40-yard dash 
and was recruited to play tight end 
by Minnesota and Michigan State 
under Mark Dantonio. Girtman 
describes him as a mismatch for 
anyone on the floor. 

And even with the twists and 

turns of an unorthodox recruitment, 
he wound up where he belongs. 

“You can’t argue that (the 

pandemic) hurt Will’s recruitment,” 
Girtman said. “The only thing I 
think it did was delay those big 
schools 
offering. 
Those 
were 

inevitable. 
They 
were 
coming 

anyway, it just took a little longer.”

“Being able to take official visits 

and that stuff, I think it definitely 
would’ve been different,” Tschetter 
said of his decision. “But I feel totally 
comfortable with my choice.”

Ybarra, Osman leading 
through difficult time

Leaders need to be able to 

adapt 
to 
whatever 
situation 

comes about, no matter how 
grave or difficult.

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team’s 
season 
is 
currently 

suspended, with a possible start 
date in the spring. For its players, 
the potential cancellation or 
further postponement of a season 
feels like a rock in their stomachs. 
But Wolverine captains Umar 
Farouk Osman and Marc Ybarra 
have a different narrative for 
themselves and the team. 

Michigan and other athletic 

programs across the country 
are facing an extraordinarily 
difficult 
situation. 
Yet, 
led 

by Osman and Ybarra, the 
Wolverines 
have 
persevered 

and stayed motivated through 
these peculiar times. During the 
offseason, even prior to their 
return to campus, Osman and 
Ybarra made a concerted effort to 
set an example that would trickle 
down to the younger players. 

“Before we started preseason, 

we had Zoom sessions every week 
to help with mental preparation,” 
Osman said. “The coaches gave 
us videos so that we were all on 
the same page and that we all 
understand the philosophy of 
the team so we have the same 
mindset.” 

For Ybarra, the difficulty 

of 
not 
playing 
during 
this 

unprecedented time is amplified 
by the fact that all of the players 
on the team were physically 
and mentally preparing for the 
team’s season over the summer. 
In August, it was extremely 
tough to hear that the season was 
postponed. Ybarra said the team 
is now preparing for a season in 
the spring, hopefully, with the 
NCAA Tournament moved from 
April 30 to May 17, 2021. 

For the Wolverines, leadership 

is of the utmost importance. 

“We are trying to create a 

driven culture, and it comes 
from the captains on the team, 
so we try our best to make sure 
the freshman feel comfortable,” 
Osman said. “We are all on 
the same mindset that we are 
here to work hard every single 
day, challenging ourselves and 
holding each other accountable 
in practice.”

According to Ybarra, there is 

a certain culture on the team to 
which the freshman are easily 
assimilating. 

“A 
lot 
of 
it 
is 
internal. 

We 
haven’t 
had 
explicit 

conversations with these players. 
They just came in excited and 
ready to go and a lot of them 
are playing really well,” Ybarra 
said. “The freshmen have been 
doing a really good job being 
smart, being safe. It’s definitely a 
different time to acclimate to the 
university, but I think the fact 
that we’ve had regular training is 
hopeful to give them a routine.”

Harrison Brown’s journey from

Queensland to Michigan

When he was about 10 years 

old, Michigan senior Harrison 
Brown began playing at a 
tennis center called Griffith 
University 
in 
Queensland, 

Australia. For two years he 
stayed there, training three 
hours in the evening — two 
hours of tennis and one hour 
of fitness. From there, he 
made the move to the national 
academy in Brisbane where he 
trained for another two years, 
from ages 12 to 14. 

In around late July to early 

August in his final year in 
Australia, he received an email 
from Andrew Stubbs, a coach 
from 
Montverde 
Academy 

in the Orlando area, offering 
him a full scholarship to play 
there. Brown didn’t know what 
to expect when he decided to 
make the move to the United 
States right before his fifteenth 
birthday.

“I had no idea when the 

school year was in America,” 
Brown said. “I’ve only ever 
known Australia, you start 
school in January, finish in 
December.” 

He knew going to Montverde 

was the right move for him 
because he wanted to go to 
college, but still, he weighed 
the pros and cons before 
making a decision. 

The major downside for him 

was that at 14 years-old he 
would be moving away from 
home and his family for the 
first time. At the same time, he 
also saw this as an advantage 
because it helped him become 
more independent. 

“I was happy with that,” 

Brown said. “I felt like I didn’t 
need to stay at home or be held 
back, I guess, from a better 
potential in the U.S.”

Montverde 
also 
offered 

him 
a 
full 

scholarship, 
something he 
didn’t 
have 

in 
Brisbane, 

with tougher 
competition 
and 
more 

opportunities 
to 
play 

international 
tennis 
tournaments 
in the U.S. 

“I feel like 

at that time 
when I was 14, I was ranked I 
think in like the top 10 or 15 in 
Australia for my age,” Brown 
said. “Then when I moved 
to the U.S I was like top 100 
basically.”

But 
Brown’s 
time 
at 

Montverde didn’t last long. 
One 
day 
in 
April 
of 
his 

sophomore year, he was called 
to a meeting. The tennis part 
of the academy was shutting 
down and replaced by a school 
team. 

“We 
never 
got 
told 

exactly why but we had our 
speculations and everything,” 
Brown said.

This left Brown with a 

dilemma. 
They 
gave 
the 

students at the academy one of 
three options: stay at the school 
at Montverde Academy and 
practice with the school team 
(which was a dramatic drop 
in level), go back to Australia 
or make the move to Hilton 

Head Island, 
S.C. to attend 
Smith Sterns 
Tennis 
Academy 
and complete 
their 
schooling 
there.

Wanting 

to 
continue 

his 
journey 

in the U.S., 
Brown chose 
to 
make 

the 
move 

to Hilton Head to train at 
Smith Sterns. He thought it 
would also be best for college 
recruiting. Once there, Brown 
found 
the 
experience 
was 

much different than it was in 
Orlando. 

“When when I went to 

Smith Sterns Tennis Academy, 
it was in a small neighborhood, 
things 
were 
very 
close 

together, the beach only took 
two minutes or three minutes 
to walk to, it was sort of like 

an island life,” Brown said. “It 
was basically tennis, school, 
sleep, like that. It was very 
disciplined and you didn’t 
really have as much of a choice 
of social things to do.”

During the time Brown 

was at Smith Sterns, his 
play improved significantly, 
and at the end of his junior 
year he started to talk to 
college coaches and began 
the recruiting process. He 
was driven both academically 
and in tennis, and decided he 
wanted to go to a college that 
was in the top 25 for both.

He 
began 
talking 
to 

Michigan 
coach 
Adam 

Steinberg, and the assistant 
coach 
at 
the 
time, 
Sean 

Maymi, and throughout the 
summer of his junior year 
and start of his senior year, 
the coaches came to some of 
Brown’s tournaments to watch 
him compete.

“I played well and we 

stayed in contact and they 
kept watching me for all my 
results,” Brown said. “Then I 
had a bit of a breakthrough in 
November or December of my 
senior year.”

In February of 2017, he got 

an offer from the Wolverines. 
He talked to his coaches, and 
unanimously they encouraged 
him to accept the offer and 
attend Michigan. 

“I gotta go here,” Brown 

said. “Hearing that from every 
coach is pretty special.”

MADELINE STONE-WHEATLEY

For The Daily

I had a bit of a
breakthrough in

November or

December of my

senior year.


Jaylen 
Jones 
and 
Tyler 

Fullman are two supremely 
talented 
student 
athletes 

from 
Georgia 
and 
Chicago, 

respectively. They both have 
athletic accolades under their 
belts, and they both have their 
sights set on professional ball.

Jones and Fullman are two 

Black pitchers who will join 
Michigan’s baseball team next 
year. They will find themselves 
under the tutelage of coach Erik 
Bakich, who has gained national 
attention in recent years for 
his insistence on having a 
racially diverse roster in a sport 
that is known — especially 
at the college level — to be 
overwhelmingly white.

They’ll be joining a team that 

has had recent success. The last 
uninterrupted college baseball 
season 
saw 
the 
Wolverines 

come a mere game away from 
a national championship, a feat 
the Michigan baseball program 
hadn’t achieved in over half a 
century.

Jones, 
a 
left-hander 
who 

boasts a fastball that reaches 
the mid-90s, is no stranger to 
the mentality Bakich has been 
trying to avoid — that Black 
college baseball players come 
across as abnormal, requiring 
further scrutiny in the scouting 
process.

“A white player, they can go 

out there one time, dominate, 
and then they’ll get the offer, 
but (college coaches) want to see 
me multiple times because they 
want to make sure, ‘If I’m gonna 
spend money for a Black player 
to come here, he’s gotta perform 
more than once,’ ” Jones said. 
“I’ve had some SEC schools that 
haven’t really been known for 
recruiting Black players. And 
(Bakich) didn’t care about that. 
I performed, he liked it, he gave 
me a scholarship and I took it.”

Jones also echoed a point that 

Bakich made two years ago in 
a Washington Post interview: 
Baseball can be an expensive 
game for youth baseball players 
in America, as showcases and 
travel 
costs 
mount 
quickly 

for 
high-level 
players. 
This 

can prove to be a frustrating 
obstacle, 
particularly 
for 

minority players with inner-
city roots that struggle to get 
exposure.

“Sometimes 
Black 
players 

can’t afford to go play baseball 
… and Bakich stresses that he 
wants to give everybody the 
same opportunity,” Jones said. 
“It don’t matter your race or 
whatever, it’s not political for 
him, it’s just, ‘We want to get the 
best type of players.’ ”

Fullman, 
a 
righty 
with 

velocity 
just 
as 
impressive 

as Jones’s, has been playing 
baseball since he was four. In 
recent years, that time has been 
spent playing with White Sox 
ACE, a program designed to help 
inner-city baseball players in 
Chicago avoid just this problem, 
giving many players a chance to 

face high-level competition and 
gain exposure that otherwise 
would be difficult or impossible 
to obtain. 

True to form, Bakich has 

developed inroads with the ACE 
program, as Fullman will join 
redshirt 
sophomore 
catcher 

Jordon Rogers as the second 
player from the program on the 
team next fall. Dillon Head, a 
2023 outfielder from ACE, is 
committed as well.

As a teammate, color makes 

no difference to Fullman. He’s 
focused. 

“I treat everybody like family, 

man,” Fullman said. “I care 
about the team, (and) I care 
about winning. I want to be a 
leader.”

But as an individual, the 

hard-throwing 
righty 
knows 

the weight that comes with 
representing 
a 
woefully 

underrepresented group in the 
sport he’s been passionate about 
for nearly his whole life.

“As an African American, 

sometimes I think, like, ‘Man, 
like I’m not even supposed to be 
here. I’m not even supposed to 

be playing this sport right now, 
’cause it really isn’t meant for 
me and this game don’t really 
love nobody.’ I’ve had those 
thoughts,” Fullman said. “But 
you know, I just kept going and 
I still worked on my game and it 
really got me where I’m at right 
now.”

Work 
he 
did, 
and 
now, 

beginning his senior year of 
high school, Fullman has his 
sights set on Michigan and 
beyond. A future in the MLB is 
the ultimate goal, and Fullman’s 
work ethic and determination 
make him more than capable of 
realizing it, but his mentality 
outside the game makes him 
prepared for success no matter 
where 
his 
baseball 
career 

eventually takes him.

“I want to major in sports 

management,” 
Fullman 
said. 

“I want to own my own sports 
complex 
and 
become 
an 

entrepreneur one day, and I 
want to be a good student (at 
Michigan), man.”

As they prepare to take the 

mound at Ray Fisher Stadium, 
Fullman 
and 
Jones 
are 

following in the footsteps of 
several successful Black players 
who 
have 
already 
created 

their legacies — or are creating 
them still — in the Michigan 
baseball 
program. 
Jones 

shares Fullman’s major league 
aspirations, 
and 
he’s 
found 

sources of advice and wisdom 
in junior pitcher Isaiah Page 
— himself an outspoken voice 
against racial injustice during 
the past year — and Jordan 
Nwogu, a decorated Michigan 
outfielder who just signed with 
the Chicago Cubs as a third-
round draft pick. The two 
players showed Jones around 
during his visit to Michigan in 
the fall of 2019, and Nwogu’s 
successful ascent to the next 
level has been a powerful source 
of inspiration.

“I look up to Nwogu because 

he’s a heck of a ballplayer, and 
now he’s gotten drafted,” Jones 
said. “You try to follow in those 
footsteps because it’s another 
Black 
player 
that 
has 
the 

opportunity to play professional 
ball, and that’s my dream as 
well. I contact him about little 

stuff and ask him things… (and) 
I know I can ask him ’cause he’s 
been through everything at 
Michigan, and he’s had a ton of 
success.”

Above 
all 
else, 
the 
two 

budding stars in Michigan’s 
future rotation eagerly await 
their collegiate futures, because 
to them, Michigan isn’t simply 
a place to play baseball. It’s a 
town, a university and a team 
that’s eagerly awaiting them, 
too.

“I went up for an official visit, 

and right then and there I knew. 
I knew it was the place for me. 
Everything I could’ve wanted 
in a school — they had it,” Jones 
said. “I felt comfortable there.”

Fullman expressed a similar 

sentiment, 
adding 
that 
the 

proximity of Michigan to his 
hometown makes it all the 
more special that he was given 
an opportunity to play in Ann 
Arbor.

“It’s 
the 
greatest 
school 

around, really, to me,” Fullman 
said. 
“That’s 
how 
I 
feel. 

Michigan’s a great, awesome 
school. It’s a school that makes 
me feel like I’m home.”

In 
Jones 
and 
Fullman, 

Bakich’s 
squad 
is 
getting 

two 
players 
who 
possess 

the qualities any successful 
program looks for. They are 
skilled, determined and selfless, 
and while they both have had 
unique experiences as Black 
players in a sport that often fails 
when it comes to diversity, their 
focus lies squarely on the task 
ahead. 

Fans 
will 
cheer, 
batters 

will be sent trudging back to 
the dugout, and Jones and 
Fullman will be on the mound, 
representing the university that 
they hope will propel them to 
much greater heights in the 
coming years.

“It’s 
really 
a 
blessing,” 

Fullman said. “It’s always been 
a dream for me to get accepted 
to this school.”

Cameron Amine ready to follow in 

family’s footsteps at Michigan

Cameron 
Amine 
is 

Michigan wrestling royalty. 

His 
father, 
uncle, 
two 

cousins and brother all went 
through the program, and 
their family produces top-
tier collegiate athletes — 
 

All Americans and NCAA 
finalists among them. As the 
newest Amine to join the 
team, Cameron expects a 
dominant year coming off his 
redshirt season. 

Entering 
his 
freshman 

year a season ago, it was 
understood Amine was going 
to redshirt. While he wanted 
to jump right into the line of 
fire, he recognized he needed 
to get stronger and smarter 
before competing. 

“I thought I was ready for 

the college level,”Amine said. 
“But once I first came in it 
was like ‘I got to adapt to the 
style.’ ” 

During his first year as 

a Wolverine waiting for an 
opportunity, 
Amine 
never 

stopped 
training. 
Every 

practice he brought a great 
intensity with the hope of 

more action next year. In 
the 
four 
tournaments 
he 

was allowed while retaining 
his redshirt, he went an 
impressive 15-5. 

“(Cameron) 
is 
a 
silent 

worker, really consistent and 
brings an incredible effort and 
intensity to all his workouts 
and training,” Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet said. “It (was) 
apparent during his freshman 
year.” 

Now as a redshirt freshman, 

Amine is ready to take on a 
more vocal and active role 
within the team. He’s been 
extremely competitive since 
he was a young kid with his 
brother and cousins, and now 
he’s ready to show it against 
tougher opponents. He wants 
to display to his teammates — 
and the rest of the conference 
 

— all of the work he put in 
during the offseason.

“I’m the young buck on 

this team, but I’m here and 
I’m going to challenge (my 
teammates),” Amine said. 

In addition to his work 

his freshman year, Amine 
spent all of the quarantine 
and summer working out. 
Between wrestling on the 
mats in his basement and 

working out in his relative’s 
garage gym, he feels his game 
has improved dramatically 
since last season. 

“(I think) I’m a little under 

the radar so I want to come 
out swinging,” Amine said. 

He always was at the top of 

the wrestling ladder in high 
school — winning three state 
championships 
for 
Detroit 

Catholic Central High School 
 

— and believes he’ll get back 
there. 

Additionally, 
Amine 

constantly 
puts 
immense 

expectations 
on 
himself. 

He wants to dominate. And 
he wants to win an NCAA 
Championship. 

“One of the great things 

about him is he loves to 
compete,” Bormet said. “He 
loves competing against the 
toughest guys in the country 
and with great composure.” 

Bormet 
shares 
Amine’s 

sentiments, thinking he and 
the team can achieve great 
accomplishments this season. 

Amine, like everyone else, 

is at the mercy of COVID-19, 
so his season is in limbo. If 
and when it starts, he plans 
on 
achieving 
one 
thing: 

dominance.

How international field hockey 
players dealt with the pandemic

When 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic hit in March, all 
Michigan students were advised 
to leave campus. 

For international students — 

including sophomore midfielder 
Nina Apoola of the Michigan 
field hockey team — being sent 
home entailed more than a few 
hours in the car. 

“I had to pack everything in 

my dorm room and book a flight 
back to England within two 
days,” Apoola said.

With the virus spreading, 

the world reacting and borders 
closing, 
Apoola 
and 
junior 

goalkeeper Anna Spieker had 
to act fast to return to their 
home countries of England and 
Germany, respectively. Spieker 
enjoyed the opportunity to bond 
with family in Germany — but 
after a while at home, the stir-
craziness sets in for everyone.

“It was probably the longest 

I’ve ever gone without field 
hockey,” Apoola said.

Although they were luckily 

able to get home — with borders 
fully closing mere days after 
arrival — and happy to slow 

down and spend time with loved 
ones, little by little things started 
to open up. After the University 
announced its fall reopening 
plans, and with a possible season 
looming, 
both 
Spieker 
and 

Apoola knew it was time to get 
back.

But returning to the United 

States 
wasn’t 
without 
its 

complications.

For Spieker, a dual-citizen, 

it was more about attention 
to detail. After double- and 
triple-checking 
the 
German 

Embassy’s web page, she was 
able to return to Ann Arbor in 
a relatively smooth — but still 
stressful — fashion. Apoola, on 
the other hand, does not have a 
U.S. passport, and with England 
still deep in lockdown, she had a 
few more hoops to jump through.

With the requirement of a two-

week quarantine, Apoola and her 
German teammate — sophomore 
midfielder and forward Sarah 
Pyrtek — hatched a plan to get 
back to the U.S. Because travelers 
from England were barred from 
entering the U.S., they travelled 
to Aruba and fulfilled their two-
week quarantine there. 

About 
halfway 
into 
the 

Aruban quarantine, the rules 
changed, and it turned out 

Pyrtek and Apoola did not have 
to go to Aruba at all. However, 
they were glad to have played it 
safe as they had a deep desire to 
return to the team, and nothing 
was going to stop them.

After arriving in early July, 

the situation continued to evolve. 
With no Big Ten foes to take on 
this fall, the team is taking part 
in highly competitive practices 
as they look to improve in 
preparation for the upcoming 
season, whenever it may be. 

“It’s a difficult task,” Spieker 

said. “We’re taking it day by day.” 

Added Apoola: “We have to 

make every one of these days 
count.” 

After 
traversing 
halfway 

around the globe and back 
during this pandemic, and seeing 
so much along the way, Spieker 
and Apoola are finding even 
more enjoyment in being with 
their teammates on campus, 
and they’re taking nothing for 
granted. They’ve had to clear 
added hurdles to arrive from 
abroad, yet they continue to 
bring a clear-eyed approach to 
it all. 

“There’s so many people in far 

worse situations,” Apoola said. 
“We’re grateful to even be able 
to play.”

Undersized and overlooked, Ronnie 

Bell set to anchor young receiver corps

Ronnie 
Bell 
had 
been 

exiled from campus amid the 
pandemic. Gyms were closed. 
So were local football fields. 
But the junior wide receiver 
had to find a way to train. So 
on his second day home, his 
dad came up with the ultimate 
workout. 

That’s how Bell ended up 

pushing a Chevy Tahoe around 
his neighborhood, racing his 
16-year-old twin brothers who 
pushed a Lexus about half the 
size.

Bell’s story has been repeated 

ad 
nauseam. 
Originally 

committed to play basketball 
at Missouri State, Bell received 
a late offer from Michigan 
in 2017 and stepped into a 
starting role his sophomore 
year. Once an afterthought on 
a unit that included Donovan 
Peoples-Jones, Nico Collins 
and Tarik Black, Bell finished 
the 2019 season with a team-
best 758 receiving yards. 

Peoples-Jones 
and 
Black 

are gone now. Collins likely 
is, too, with Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh saying on a 
WTKA appearance Monday 
that he hasn’t submitted a 
waiver request. Bell is the 
most 
experienced 
receiver 

left. Still, he’s a bit under the 
radar. During a Zoom media 
session Thursday, Bell spent 
roughly the first half of the 

call answering questions about 
teammates before he was asked 
about himself. But Bell knows 
he’s the anchor of this unit, and 
when the season starts Oct. 24, 
it will be his turn to step into 
the spotlight.

“I realized it more, especially 

with all those guys gone now, 
I’m lowkey kinda old,” Bell 
said. “And for all the younger 
guys, every day in practice 
I just wanna show them the 
effort it takes, whether that’s 
when you get the ball or not 
or you’re out there blocking on 
the edge, I just wanna show all 
the guys the intensity that we 
gotta play with.”

Bell’s best quality as a 

player is his ability to get 
open and evade contact, but 
he’s struggled with drops — 
never more apparent than last 
year, when he let the potential 
game-tying touchdown at Penn 
State slip through his fingers. 
That’s something Bell’s been 
working on in practice, putting 
more emphasis on taking care 
of the ball. He’s worked on his 
strength, thanks to the Tahoe. 
And especially, he’s worked on 
his speed.

When Bell watches film, 

he sees himself making plays 
and is hungry to make more. 
He practices hard, setting the 
standard for everyone around 
him. He’s prepared to move 
outside the slot more and play 
any position if that’s what the 
team needs.

“Just being able to have a guy 

that’s played a ton of football, 
he understands things, and 
Ronnie’s motivated,” offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis said 
Wednesday. “Even though a 
lot of people view a success 
for Ronnie last year, Ronnie 
believed, and he knows that 
last year, it was just scratching 
the 
surface. 
There 
were 

opportunities to be even better, 
so now it’s about how he can 
take his game from one year 
and develop it the next year 
and make it even better.”

Undersized for a receiver 

at just six feet tall, Bell knows 
that what he lacks in height, he 
must make up for in skill. As 
the leader of a receiver room 
that also includes 5-foot-9 
Giles Jackson and 5-foot-10 
Mike Sainristil, Bell knows the 
intensity they’ll have to bring 
with the “tall guys” gone.

Bell was never supposed to 

be the guy leading the receivers 
his junior year. He’s not Collins 
and he acknowledges as much. 
But he’s starting to find his 
footing as a leader, and now, on 
the precipice of stepping into 
the spotlight, he may just be 
the right guy for the job.

“He has a tremendous work 

ethic, I’d say,” Jackson said on 
Sept. 17. “He definitely brings 
all the juice to the receiver 
room. He’s super fun to be 
around, I’d say he’s the jokester 
of the group by far. He’s super 
fun to be around. He always 
brings energy to practice, he 
brings us with him.”

MILES MACKLIN/Daily

Junior wide receiver Ronnie Bell is taking on a leadership role within the Wolverines’ offense. 

‘Lights out’ Joe Milton impressing in 

Michigan camp

Ronnie Bell got back to Ann 

Arbor in April, when the place 
was still a ghost town — students 
at home, school all online, the 
rims off all the basketball nets 
and everyone under quarantine. 
Joe Milton was one of Bell’s only 
teammates also in the area at the 
time. So naturally, they found 
places to work, Milton throwing 
to Bell in preparation of a season 
neither could know the status of.

It would be two more months 

before the Michigan football 
team was allowed back into 
its building, and three months 
after that before the Big Ten 
announced that there would, in 
fact, be a season to play. On the 
same day as that announcement, 
it was reported that quarterback 
Dylan McCaffrey would opt 
out and transfer and receiver 
Nico Collins had signed with an 
NFL agent. That means Milton, 
in all likelihood, will be the 
quarterback and Bell his top 
target.

“This is the best I’ve ever seen 

Joe,” Bell said Thursday on a 
Zoom call with reporters. “Joe 
got here a semester before me, 
but I’ve been around Joe just as 
much as anybody and he’s just 
lights out right now.”

Out of the gamesmanship that 

governs college football even in 
2020, Michigan hasn’t yet named 
a starting quarterback for Oct. 
24, and offensive coordinator 

Josh Gattis said Wednesday 
that it won’t name any starters 
at 
all. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Cade McNamara 
has gotten requisite praise. The 
job, though, is Milton’s in status 
if not yet in name.

“Joe’s got special talent,” 

Gattis said. “He’s a quarterback 
that’s blessed with a tremendous 
skill-set, obviously with an arm 
and accuracy. He has every 
throw in the bag plus the extra 
club that you don’t need to carry 
all the time.”

Milton’s arm has been the 

stuff of folktales since he arrived 
in Ann Arbor in January 2018. 
Gattis said Wednesday that 
Milton has reached 70 yards 
about three times with pinpoint 
accuracy. 

As far as declarations of arm 

strength go, it’s one of the more 
conservative estimates Milton 
has received since arriving at 
Michigan. As far as accuracy, it’s 
notable. 

“That was one of the things 

we have talked about as far as 
taking RPMs off, knowing how 
to give a catchable ball,” Gattis 
said. “Accuracy as far as ball 
placement was never an issue, 
sometimes the issue had been 
in the past was whether or not 
those receivers could catch it 
that fast. He’s done a really good 
job in improving in that, but still 
maintaining his power in his 
arm.”

Milton’s success or failure 

will not be based on talent. It 
will come down to fundamentals 

— pocket presence, reading 
a defense and accuracy — all 
three of which Gattis gave him 
glowing reviews on. 

It’s hard to parse exactly 

what that means in non-game 
situations when padded practice 
won’t even start for another 
week. Certainly it’s encouraging. 
So were all the proclamations of 
Speed in Space that marked the 
beginning of 2019. In reality, it 
took Michigan six weeks to look 
comfortable in Gattis’s offense, 
by which time it had already lost 
twice.

And yet, it’s impossible to 

discount words like this from 
Gattis: “Every day out there, 
he makes some type of wow 
play. Those wow plays are 
not just wow plays in college 
football, they’d be wow plays on 
Sundays.”

When the Wolverines lost 

Shea Patterson, their flawed but 
firmly entrenched starter for 
the last two years, Gattis said it 
was a little scary to stare down 
the unknown. A quarterback 
competition 
between 
Milton 

and McCaffrey would have 
dominated the spring and likely 
fall camp. Instead, Michigan is 
holding its first padded practice 
three weeks before kickoff and 
Milton is the presumed starter.

Gattis is perfectly happy with 

that.

“We feel great about Joe and 

we feel great about Cade,” he 
said. “Either one of those guys 
can go out and lead our team and 
our offense.”

Joe Milton and Ronnie Bell both returned to Ann Arbor in April, allowing Michigan’s presumptive starting 
quarterback and his top wideout to train together all summer.

Managing Sports Editor

O

n Wednesday 
afternoon, when 
offensive coordi-
nator Josh Gattis 

spoke with local reporters on 
a Zoom call, the second ques-
tion he faced was about how 
his offense 
would 
improve in 
year two. 
The third 
was about 
managing 
expecta-
tions. The 
fourth was 
about junior 
quarterback 
Joe Milton. The fifth was 
about the offensive line.

In other words, it was nor-

mal. 

Well, it was on Zoom. And 

it was in September, four 

weeks after the season was 
scheduled to start. But if you 
closed your calendar and 
pretended you were in Schem-
bechler Hall, it felt as close to 
normal as 2020 is capable of 
providing.

And after the last six 

months, that’s a beautiful 
thing.

Take it from Gattis, who 

said, “Obviously there’s a 
lot of excitement around the 
building.” Receiver Giles 
Jackson agreed that excite-
ment was the first emotion 
anyone felt when football 
returned. Or, as linebacker 
Josh Ross put it, “It’s just a 
blessing we get to play this 
fall.” 

I’m not here to tell you that 

fans have to feel the same 
way. This season won’t be 
entirely normal even if the Big 

Ten gets through nine games 
without problems. College 
football, more than any other 
sport, is based on tradition 
and the energy that a game 
day brings to a community. 
None of that will be the same 
in 2020.

Fans will still miss tailgat-

ing and making the weekly 
pilgrimage to Michigan Stadi-
um. They’ll miss being a part 
of the biggest crowd watching 
a football game anywhere in 
America today and belting out 
Mr. Brightside at the end of 
the third quarter.

But if you don’t think it’ll be 

fun, look at this past Saturday.

At noon, you were flipping 

between a pair of ranked 
matchups before No. 3 Okla-
homa blew a 28-7 lead to Kan-
sas State. A few hours later, 
Texas recovered an onside 

kick to come back from 15 
down with three minutes left. 
The defending champs, LSU, 
lost to unranked Mississippi 
State. Speaking of Mississippi 
State, K.J. Costello threw for 
623 yards.

In other words, it was awe-

some. More importantly, 
it felt as close to normal as 
anyone could hope for. In a 
handful of hours, the College 
Football Playoff picture was 
upended, new Heisman favor-
ites emerged and the talking 
points were endless.

For a few hours, fans in the 

SEC, Big 12 and ACC didn’t 
have to think about the pan-
demic or being stuck at home 
for the seventh month in a 
row. They got to watch foot-
ball and savor a fall Saturday 
as it was meant to be.

The Big Ten isn’t quite 

there yet. While those con-
ferences have all faced 
pandemic-related problems in 
their returns to play, the Big 
Ten opted to prioritize player 
safety, postponing the season 
until it could mandate daily 
COVID-19 testing.

That means Michigan and 

its conference foes still have 
to wait a few weeks for their 
turn at a football Saturday. 
But when Oct. 24 arrives, it 
also means they’ll be more 
likely to finish the season 
and avoid pandemic talking 
points.

There will be fewer ques-

tions about quarantines and 
more about offensive schemes. 
Josh Gattis will be able to say 
more things like, “(Joe Mil-
ton) has every throw in the 
bag plus the extra club that 
you don’t need to carry all 

the time” and less like, “On 
some of these platforms, the 
film can become a little bit 
choppy based on your internet 
strength,” which was a real 
problem Michigan had to deal 
with when he last spoke with 
media in May.

So when you start to roll 

your eyes at coach speak or 
unnecessary Twitter contro-
versies, remember what that 
felt like. Remember how close 
we were to not having a sea-
son at all.

And then savor what we 

have, even if it’s only 2020’s 
version of normal.

This football season won’t be normal. Enjoy it anyway.

A shortened, conference-only Michigan football season beginning at the end of October may seem strange on the surface, but as far as 2020 goes, it is about as close as you could get to normalcy.
