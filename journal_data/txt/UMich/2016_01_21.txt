Same number of 
cases investigated 
despite 33-percent 

increase

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Office for Institutional 

Equity’s second annual sexual 
misconduct report found the 

number of reports of sexual 
misconduct at the University has 
increased 33 percent since 2014, 
jumping from 129 incidents to 172 
in 2015.

The report, released Thursday 

morning, showed that though the 
number of cases reported rose, 
the number of investigations 
remained unchanged. While 21 
percent of cases received full 
investigation in 2014, 17 percent 
of cases were investigated this

President Barack Obama speaks about the Detroit auto show and the Flint water crisis during a speech at the UAW-GM center in Detroit on Wednesday.

President 

highlights 2008 
bailout for car 

companies

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

DETROIT — In an effort to 

highlight the success of the auto 
industry bailout and its subsequent 
recovery, President Barack Obama 
visited the North American Auto 
Show in Detroit and spoke at the 
United Auto Workers and General 
Motors Center on Wednesday.

In 2008, the auto industry was 

nearing collapse as two of the three 
major auto producers — General 
Motors and Chrysler — faced 
bankruptcy. Both companies are 
headquartered in Detroit with 
many manufacturing plants in and 
around the city, providing many 
jobs and supporting additional 
industries 
involved 
in 
auto 

manufacturing and supply.

At the time of the bailout, 

unemployment in Detroit had 
peaked at more than 25 percent, and 
a projected 1 million additional jobs 
would have been lost had the auto 
industry been allowed to collapse.

In 
response 
to 
the 
crisis, 

Obama spearheaded a package 

that provided $85 billion in loans 
to the corporations to prevent 
them from failing. The deal was 
widely unpopular at the time, with 
a March 2009 poll indicating 60 
percent of Americans were opposed 
to the government bailout. 

On 
Wednesday, 
Obama 

acknowledged this lack of support, 
saying Obama he pushed the bailout 
through regardless because he 
believed it was the best decision.

“It wasn’t popular,” Obama 

said. “It wasn’t even popular in 
Detroit. But I said at the time I’m 
not president to be popular. I’m 
president to do what needs to be 
done.”

Since the bailout, the auto 

industry has paid back almost the 
entirety of the loans and auto sales 
have reached an all-time high at 17.4 
million units in 2015, Obama said.

The spirit of liveliness that once 

existed in Detroit is slowly coming 
back, Obama said, as a result of the 
auto industry’s recovery.

“Today you’ve got buses that are 

running again, streets that are well 
lit again,” he said. “You can feel the 
difference. You can feel something 
special happening in Detroit.”

The bailout agreement was tied 

to several additional efficiency and 
technology standards, which have 
led to American auto producers 
spearheading efforts into low-

Hackett talks

expanding 
Maize Rage

Interim Athletic 
Director also gives 
update on search for 

his successor

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

As the shot clock reached six 

seconds, the students standing 
courtside at Crisler Center began 
to count down — from nine. When 
the buzzer sounded to signify a 
shot-clock violation six seconds 
later, Minnesota’s Joey King, 
having 
fallen 
embarrassingly 

for the oldest trick in the book, 
flinched in surprise.

The impact of Michigan’s 

courtside student section, the 
Maize Rage, was readily apparent 
Wednesday, and if Michigan 
interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett has his way, more 
students will be seated courtside 
in years to come, at least for select 
high-profile games.

Hackett 
discussed 
the 

student 
seating 
arrangement, 

the University’s ongoing search 
for a long-term athletic director 
and more in an interview with 
the Daily before the Michigan 
men’s basketball team played 
Minnesota.

Making himself comfortable 

in the courtside seats that belong 
to Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, 
Hackett 
surveyed 
a 
packed 

student section and outlined 
the basics for a plan that would 
selectively 
open 
additional 

lower-bowl sections to students 
in future years.

“I think it’s the kind of thing 

where some of the best fans 
would be willing to trade for their 
University and their students,” 
Hackett said. “That’s the idea 
— would you be willing to make 
something special for them, get 
recognition for it, and get it back? 
But you give it to them for a game, 
for an Ohio State or Duke.”

The idea, essentially, is for 

season-ticket holders to offer 
their seats in a coordinated 
fashion for select high-profile

LSA and business Senior Haider Malik speaks out regarding the recent violence in Pakistan at the Diag Wednes-

Daily Staff Reporter

Students huddled around 

candles 
on 
the 
Diag 

Wednesday night as a part of 
a vigil in honor of 19 people 

murdered by militants at 
Bacha Khan University in 
Pakistan Wednesday.

Organized 
by 
MPak, 
a 

student 
organization 
for 

Pakistani students, the event 
served as a space for more 
than 40 attendees to reflect 
on the tragedy and share their 
personal connections to it.

The attack on the university, 

located in the northern city of 
Charsadda, occurred a little 
over a year after a similar 
shooting 
in 
Peshawar 
in 

which 
about 
150 
people, 

mostly schoolchildren, were 
murdered by the Taliban in 
an act of terrorism. Though 
one Taliban commander has 
claimed responsibility for the 
Bacha Khan attack, according 
to the BBC, Pakistani security 
forces have yet to determine 
definitively which militant 
group carried it out.

Though 
Forbes

reports that 90 percent of startups 
fail overall, a startup new to the 
University, EnvoyNow, is defying 
the odds and flourishing in the 
college market.

EnvoyNow is a student-run food 

delivery service that came to Ann 
Arbor this fall. The startup aims 
to deliver local restaurant food 
directly to the customer’s locations.

The delivery service says it is 

the only service that can directly 
deliver food to dorm rooms and 
library study areas, and employs 
students who have MCards to 
deliver the food so they have access 
to University buildings.

“We’ve had great reception so

Residents commemorate Aura 
Rosser’s birthday with vigil

Students walk 
with citizens 

through campus in 

remembrance 

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

A handful of protesters joined the 

Ann Arbor Alliance for Black Lives, 
the organization formerly known 
as Ann Arbor to Ferguson, and the 
Radical Washtenaw organization on 
Wednesday night for a march and 
vigil marking what would have been 
Aura Rosser’s 42nd birthday.

Rosser, a Black woman, was 

fatally shot by officer David Ried, a 
white city police officer in November 
2014. Her death sparked multiple 
protests over the past year tied to 
the Black Lives Matter movement, 
including the formation of Ann 
Arbor to Ferguson in Rosser’s name.

Attendees marched from the 

Michigan League to the pedestrian 
bridge 
overlooking 
Washtenaw 

Avenue, holding lighted signs of 
Rosser’s name surrounded by a 
heart. The group then lined up 

across the bridge to spell Rosser’s 
name, dedicating renditions of 
“Happy Birthday,” to her among 
other chants for justice and an end 
to police brutality.

The group protested last winter 

on the anniversary of the shooting, 
and continues to call for reform 
in both the city’s care of Rosser’s 
family and the police department as 
a whole.

Public Health graduate student 

Rebecca Ahmad-Robinson, who 
attended the protest, pointed out the 
nuance of Rosser’s place in social 
justice movements in Ann Arbor.

“We 
really 
want 
to 
bring 

attention and … raise her name,” 
she said. “I think we’re trying to 
celebrate the fact that she existed, 
she was a vibrant person and loved 
her community,” she said. “But it’s 
also somber in the fact that we are 
drawing attention to the fact that 
she is not here.” 

Aside from the organization’s 

name change, which organizers 
said was enacted to emphasize 
the group’s link with the national 
Black Lives Matter movement, the 
Alliance plans to push a number of 
initiatives this year ranging from 
broader demands by the national 

campaign 
to 
localized 
issues, 

like the dismissal of Ried. The 
Washtenaw County prosecutor’s 
office determined last January that 
Ried’s actions were in self-defense 
and did not warrant charges.

Another 
protester, 
Rackham 

graduate student Maryam Aziz, 
also called out John Seto, the 
former city police chief whose 
tenure Rosser died during. Seto now 
overseesstudent housing for the 
University police.

Aziz said Seto’s presence on 

campus 
is 
an 
important 
link 

between the student population and 
the city police. She added minorities’ 
perceptions of safety could have 
decreased following these events.

“Aura’s death from the city affects 

the campus very explicitly,” she said.

Ultimately, though, the vigil’s 

attendees focused on celebrating 
the person behind the cause. 

“I think people forget that people 

who have been taken by state 
violence are people,” Aziz said. 
“They miss out on minutes of their 
lives, their coffees, their midnights, 
their birthdays. And we’re here 
to say that we remember, and 
we’re gonna remember her on her 
birthday as well.”

Famous Ann Arbor restaurant 
Pretzel Bell set to be reopened

Alums, musician 

recall nights 

spent dancing and 
drinking at well-

known bar

By EMILY DAVIES

Daily Staff Reporter

Once the prime spot for 21st 

birthday 
celebrations, 
Ann 

Arbor’s restauarant Pretzel 
Bell is set to reopen this spring 
after closing three decades 
ago. 

The 
Pretzel 
Bell, 
or 

“P-Bell,” 
occupied 
the 

southwest 
corner 
of 
East 

Liberty Street and Fourth 
Avenue beginning in 1934, 
the year after then-President 
Franklin 
D. 
Roosevelt 

repealed 
prohibition. 
The 

establishment’s 
connection 

to the nation’s acceptance of 

alcohol was no coincidence, 
as “P-Bell” became a drinking 
hub in Ann Arbor, according 
to students at the time.

University alum, Patricia 

Warner, who received both 
her bachelor’s and master’s 
in Public Health from the 
University, in 1967 and 1977 
respectively, remembers the 
restaurant 
as 
her 
regular 

hang out during her time as a 
student. 

“My cousin took me to 

P-Bell’s for my 21st birthday,” 
Warner said. “I did the whole 
tradition of standing on the 
table, 
chugging 
beer 
and 

tossing (peanut) shells onto 
the floor.”

Her 
husband, 
Public 

Health Prof. Kenneth Warner, 
described it as the “single 
most fun thing to do in Ann 
Arbor, with the exception of a 
victory over Ohio State.”

The restaurant closed in 

1984 due to health violations 
and legal issues surrounding 

the then-owner, Clint Castor 
Jr.

Since its closing, a group 

of University athletes and 
alumni have been working 
with 
new 
owners 
Jon 

Carlson, 
Chet 
Czaplicka 

and Greg Lobdell to reopen 
the 
restaurant. 
Carlson, 

Czaplicka and Lobdell are 
behind some of Ann Arbor’s 
other restaurants including 
Jolly Pumpkin and Grizzly 
Peak. They recently closed 
their 
Lena 
and 
Habana 

restaurant and nightclub on 
Main Street to revive Pretzel 
Bell in its place.

The owners did not respond 

to 
repeated 
requests 
for 

comment.

Both Patricia and Kenneth 

Warner 
spoke 
particularly 

fondly of Pretzel Bell’s live 
music, with a special emphasis 
on the RFD Boys. The RFD 
Boys, a local bluegrass band, 
played at P-Bell three to four 
times per week from 1973 

until 1984 when Pretzel 
Bell closed. Despite their 
growing national popularity, 
the 
band 
honored 
its 

commitment to Pretzel Bell 
and the residents of Ann 
Arbor. Warner attributed 
some of his best memories 
to the band.

Willard Spencer, banjo, 

dobro and vocals of the 
RFD Boys, spoke fondly 
of his days playing by the 
front window, describing 
his favorite memory of a 
particular Valentine’s Day.

“There was one time 

on 
Valentine’s 
Day 
and 

there was a good foot of 
snow that hit Ann Arbor,” 
Spencer said. “I remember 
that everything was closed 
except the Pretzel Bell. 
There must have been 500 
people that night. We had 
an incredible party.”

Many locals, including 

Patricia 
and 
Kenneth 

Warner, 
have 
expressed 

hope Pretzel Bell legends 
will 
return 
with 
the 

establishment’s reopening.

University study 
examines parental 
restrictions on teen 
driving habits

Though parents reported 

limiting cell phone use, the 
number of passengers, driving 
times and driving locations of 
their teen drivers, teens reported 
their parents never placed these 
types of limitations on their 
driving, according to a C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital National Poll 
on Children’s Health.

The study, looking at parents of 

teens 13 to 18 years old and teens 
of the same age, found that while 
nine out of 10 parents reported 
they placed at least one of these 
limitations on their teen driver, 
only eight out of 10 teens reported 
receiving at least one limitation.

Parental limits included: 

requiring the teen to park to use 
their phone, allowing a limited 
number of friends or only certain 
friends in the car and scheduling a 
time at night when the teen was no 
longer allowed to drive. 

The discrepancy between what 

a parent says they limit and what 
limitations a teen perceives could 
play a key role in the safety of the 
teen, as well as other drivers. If the 
limitations are not in place, a teen 
driver’s risk of a crash can increase. 

The study was released 

simultaneously with another 
University report which examined 
a decrease in the amount of people 
receiving drivers’ licenses. 

Researchers from the University 

Transportation Research Institute 
found a decrease in the overall 
percentage of people with a license 
along with the teen increase.

 

Heightened 
temperatures 
point to climate 
change

The year 2015 was the Earth’s 

warmest year on record since 
1880, according to the National 
Centers for Environmental 
Information in the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and NASA. Both 
organizations established that 
2015 was even warmer than 2014, 
formerly the warmest year on 
Earth.

It was also found that 

December 2014 had an average 
combined global land and ocean 
surface temperature higher than 
any other month on record in the 
past 136 years.

The University press 

release highlighted University 
Engineering Prof. Richard Rood, 
who said this trend of warmer 
temperatures is expected to 
continue in years to come, and 
as a result, measures should be 
taken to plan for and manage the 
environmental changes.

Library collection of 
19th century sheet 
music to be digitized

After receiving a grant from 

the Council on Library and 
Information Resources, much 
of the University library’s 
sheet music collection from the 
Thomas Edison Phonograph 
Company will be catalogued 
and digitized over the next two 
years. 

The Edison Sheet Music 

Collection is one of the world’s 
largest collections like it, and 
holds nearly 75 percent of 
previously unknown editions.

Following the recording 

company’s closing in 1929, the 
collection was given to the 
Henry Ford family and other 
people before the University 
acquired it in 1989.

The project will result in the 

largest online collection of sheet 
music prior to 1870, and will 
emphasize themes stemming 
from the Civil War, such as 
death and veterans returning 
home.

As the digitalization of the 

collection is completed, it will 
be available via library catalogs

carbon emission vehicles and other 
advanced technologies.

As a result of these standards, 

fuel economy has reached an all-
time high and the cost for electric 
car batteries has fallen 70 percent. 
Obama said the American auto 
industry has found a balance 
between sustainability and profit.

“The auto industry here in the 

United States has figured out that 
we can make more fuel efficient 
cars that reduce carbon pollution 
that causes climate change and 
make a profit and put more people 
to work,” he said. “There’s no 
contradiction between creating jobs 
and economic growth and caring for 
the environment.”

Looking more broadly at the 

country as a whole, Obama said 
Detroit’s progress is a lesson in how 
to approach the future.

“What’s true of Detroit is true of 

the country,” he said. “Here, now, 
I want you to remember how far 
we’ve come. The reason I want to 
remind you is not because I’m on the 
ticket but because I want Americans 

to have confidence in where we need 
to go.”

During his speech, Obama also 

addressed the Flint water crisis 
concerning the tainted water supply 
in the city following a switch from 
Detroit city water to using the Flint 
River as a water source. The crisis 
and the delayed response by city and 
state officials to declare a state of 
emergency in Flint has been a recent 
topic of national conversation.

Obama also met with Flint 

Mayor Karen Weaver on Tuesday in 
Washington to discuss the issue. He 
did not visit the city during his time 
in Michigan.

In his speech, Obama said he 

would support the mayor and people 
of Flint through the crisis.

“I told her we were going to 

have her back and all of the people 
of Flint’s back as we work our way 
through this terrible tragedy,” he 
said. “It is a reminder of why we 
can’t shortchange the basic services 
we provide for our people.”

Obama concluded his speech by 

expressing his confidence in the 
American people and the future of 
the country.

EnvoyNow. “Most people have told 
us they love the service because it is 
very convenient for them because 
they don’t have to go anywhere”

The company was started by 

Anthony Zhang, a University of 
Southern California student, who 
wanted a more convenient way to 
have food delivered.

In an interview, EnvoyNow’s 

University executive board said 
Zhang realized that the only way 
the food could be delivered directly 
to him was if students were the 
delivery people and were able to get 
through the dorm or library security 
systems. This led to the formation 
of EnvoyNow at USC, and after a 
$100,000 investment from Shark 
Tank’s Mark Burnett, it has made 
its way to universities all around the 
United States.

LSA freshman Patrick Skelly, 

the 
senior 
expansion 
manager 

at EnvoyNow, knew Zhang from 
his high school, and brought the 
company to the University, where he 
helped develop the executive board 
of seven members, six of whom are 
freshman.

In order to use the service, 

students connect their credit cards 
to the EnvoyNow app, which allows 
them order food from restaurants in 
Ann Arbor like Burger Fi, Salads UP, 
Chipotle, Buffalo Wild Wings, Frita 
Batidos and more. The first delivery 
fee is waived and for subsequent 
orders a flat $2.99 delivery fee is 
added to each order.

The 
University’s 
EnvoyNow 

executive 
board 
noted 
positive 

responses from students, leading to 
the fast growth of the company — in 
the month and a half since launching 
they said they’ve gone from 30 orders 
a week to 200.

“Students reactions have been 

overwhelmingly 
positive,” 
Jacob 

Frank, an LSA junior and strategic 
development manager, said. “We 
have about an 80 percent yield rate 
in overturning customers, which 
is like 50 percent more than other 
delivery services. People really like 
the fact that it is student oriented and 
convenient.”

LSA freshman Rachel Liebergall, 

a user of the app, said she thinks the 

fact that EnvoyNow is student-run 
makes the idea of the delivery service 
more appealing.

“I think it’s a really great app 

that makes food delivery very pain 
free and easy,” she said. “I like 
that it’s student-run and that I’m 
contributing to a student business.”

The board said they thought the 

high demand for the service is due to 
students’ appreciation for the service, 
and 
the 
company’s 
grassroots 

marketing strategies.

“We literally have gone up to all of 

the kids in Markley with their doors 
open and just talked to them about 
Envoy, and our plans for the future,” 
Skelly said. “We found that kids 
were extremely receptive and many 
of them helped us by telling their 
friends.”

They have also reached out to 

students studying in the Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library, employed 
30 Envoy representatives in different 
sororities and fraternities to speak 
at their chapters and posted on 
Facebook and Instagram promoting 
the service.

“We attended the startup career 

fair this week so we posted a 
photograph of that on Facebook,” 
said Engineering freshman Enis 
Habib, head of marketing. “We are 
getting more likes on that page, and 
we want to keep growing in social 
media.”

The executive board is also 

striving to get more restaurants to 
sign with them. Once a contract is 
signed, Envoy began to receive 20 
percent of the order’s profits, and 
Envoy is given privlages, like being 
able to skip the lines in various 
restaurants, 
allowing 
for 
faster 

delivery.

In accordance with the positive 

responses and fast growth, the 
demand for service has surpassed the 
company’s supply of labor. This past 
weekend, they had to ask customers 
to wait 15 minutes to place an order 
while the Envoys finished the orders 
they were working on, an issue the 
company will have to address as it 
moves forward and continues to 
grow.

“We found that students absolutely 

love our service. So much so that it is 
at a pace that is hard to keep up with 
delivery people,” Skelly said. “We are 
looking for more delivery people.”

year.

The University is currently 

under federal investigation by 
the Department of Education, 
for its handling of several 
sexual assault cases.

Of the 172 cases presented 

in 2015, 29 were investigated, 
66 were referred to the Review 
Panel and 78 did not fall within 
“the scope of the Policy,” 
according to the report. The 
number of cases reviewed by 
the panel — which included 
representatives from SAPAC, 
police and general counsel 
Timothy Lynch — or addressed 
in 
an 
alternative 
manner 

increased by 18 and 21 from 
2014 respectively.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Anthony 

Walesby, the University Title 
IX coordinator, who also serves 
as the senior director of OIE, 
suggested the rise in sexual 
misconduct 
reports 
stems 

from 
improved 
education 

efforts and awareness of the 
definition of misconduct, as 
well as of the policies and 
procedures involved.

A 2015 University campus 

climate 
survey 
on 
sexual 

misconduct revealed that only 
3.6 percent of students who 
reported having at least one 
unwanted sexual experience 
at the University chose to 
report the incident to an 
official University resource or 
law enforcement.

“This 
is 
a 
very 

underreported 
issue 
that 

happens, and so I think the 
more and more reports that we 
get and the more opportunities 
we have to address concerns is 
a good thing,” Walesby said. 
“We are addressing issues on 
our campus, and so we see it 
increase in number of reports 
that come forward.”

Of 
the 
29 
reports 

investigated, OIE concluded 
10 cases to be in violation of 
the policy, with a total of 33 
potential 
policy 
violations 

considered. In 17 of the 29 
cases, investigators did not 
find enough evidence to cite a 
sexual misconduct violation. 
Two cases are still pending.

Walesby is responsible for 

deciding whether a University 
investigation 
will 
be 

conducted, although a review 
panel provides input in the 
decision, what actions should 
be taken if the perpetrator is 
unknown and whether they 
believe other measures could 
be considered. 

Walesby said while only 

29 were fully investigated 
from beginning to end, he 
considers all cases to have 
been thoroughly reviewed.

“I would say that all 172 are 

investigated,” Walesby said. 
“There is effort that goes into 
each one of those matters … 
we are looking into it. I can 
definitely guarantee you that 
if there is an issue that can be 
investigated and is appropriate 
for us to investigate, we don’t 
hesitate.”

As of Oct. 1, 2015, three 

students who violated the 
policy by engaging in sexual 
assault 
were 
permanently 

separated from the University, 
according to the report.

Additionally, 
the 
OSCR 

proposed 
temporary 

separations — a set period of 
time in which students are 
unable to enroll in classes 
or participate in University 
events — against two students 
for one year or less.

Other students found in 

violation of the policy received 
a 
series 
of 
disciplinary 

sanctions 
including 

probation, no contact between 
respondent and complaint, and 
educational measures. These 
sanctions could also have been 
applied to the two students 
who 
received 
temporary 

separations. 
Overall, 
four 

sanctions 
of 
disciplinary 

probation, 
seven 
sanctions 

mandating 
no 
contact 

between 
the 
respondent 

and the complainants and 
four sanctions that included 
educational measures were 
given. If any of the respondents 
still at the University engage in 
any other form of misconduct, 
they will face further sanctions 
up to expulsion.

Seventy-eight of the 172 

cases this year were deemed 
to be outside of the scope 
of the policy. The report 
highlighted three reasons this 
may occur: the behavior is not 
considered sexual misconduct, 
the respondent is not affiliated 
with the University or the 
alleged victim reveals no such 
unwanted conduct took place.

When there is insufficient 

information 
to 
classify 
a 

complaint— the respondent’s 
identity 
is 
unknown, 
the 

investigation is unwanted and/
or the complainant requests 
confidentiality — the Review 
Panel 
then 
discusses 
the 

report and advises the Title IX 
coordinator on the next course 
of action. Sixty-six cases of the 
cases reported this year were 
reviewed by the panel, which 
consists of University faculty 
and staff, in this fashion, and 
of the 66 reviewed, 55 were 
“closed.”

However, 
Walesby 

emphasized that when OIE 
finds insufficient evidence to 
prove violation of the policy, 
it does not mean the conduct 
did not occur. He stressed that 
when reviewing a report, he 
and the other panel members 
consider the concrete facts of 
each individual case.

“When we issue a report of 

no violation, we’re not saying 
that it didn’t happen,” Walesby 
said. “We’re saying that the 
evidence was insufficient in 
terms of knowing enough to 
say that there was a violation. 
It doesn’t mean it didn’t 
happen, 
but 
the 
evidence 

doesn’t support that.”

Panel 
members 
decide 

whether the case falls within 
the scope of the current policy. 
According to the policy, the 
Title IX coordinator makes 
the final decision on “whether, 
how, and to what extent the 
University will conduct an 
investigation, 
and 
whether 

other measures will be taken.”

Walesby said even in those 

cases outside of the policy’s 
scope, the University does all 
it can to support complainants. 
In all cases of misconduct, 
complainants and respondents 
are 
offered 
appropriate 

support 
and 
resources 
as 

well as interim measures — 
steps taken to protect those 
involved, 
including 
safety 

escorts, scheduling changes 

and housing changes.

“We may not be able to 

address 
the 
allegations 

themselves, but we might be 
able to do something,” Walesby 
said. “There may be something 
that falls outside of our policy 
but we still make sure persons 
have resources.”

The University’s Student 

Sexual Misconduct Policy has 
undergone several revisions 
over the past years, starting 
with an interim policy put 
in place in 2011 in response 
to a “Dear Colleague” letter 
from 
the 
Department 
of 

Education to colleges across 
the country recommending 
that they update their policies. 
A 2012 revision to the policy 
prompted 
the 
creation 
of 

the now-annual OIE report, 
among 
other 
changes 
— 

previously, 
the 
Office 
of 

Student Conflict Resolutions 
handled the publication of 
this data, incorporating the 
sexual misconduct cases in a 
subsection of a larger report of 
student complaints, violations, 
resolutions and sanctions.

The 
current 
sexual 

misconduct 
policy 
was 

implemented in August 2013. 
The updated version decreased 
the burden of proof applied 
in sexual misconduct cases, 
requiring decisions to be made 
based on a “preponderance of 
evidence.”

After 
extensive 
data 

collection 
and 
feedback, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel saidin September he 
aims to release another revised 
version of the policy before the 
year’s end.

“It’s 
ongoing,” 
Walesby 

said of the revisions. “But we 
expect to finalize the latest 
version shortly. The intent is 
to make it understandable and 
readable.”

Draft 
changes 
released 

by the University in the 
fall 
included 
altering 
the 

definition 
of 
coercion, 

force 
and 
incapacitation. 

Attendees 
at 
an 
October 

SAPAC roundtablediscussion 
noted that the current policy 
does not clearly specify the 
number of drinks it takes to 
be incapacitated and unable 
to give consent. They also 
expressed concern about the 
current definition of consent.

“We got great feedback 

from our campus community, 
and we’re still looking at all 
that and what it might mean,” 
Walesby said. “Some of the 
things that we grapple with 
within the definitions is trying 
to be fair to both parties. 
We’re hopeful that wherever 
we land in terms of the 
language that it’s sending the 
clearest message that we can, 
recognizing that these issues 
themselves are difficult.”

At the SAPAC roundtable 

discussions, there were also 
discussions 
about 
several 

other draft changes, such as 
improving interim measures, 
increasing 
support 
for 

survivors, 
deciding 
how 

students should be chosen to 
sit on the advisory board and 
whether to identify witnesses.

“Any 
suggestions 
that 

folks have, we’re very, very 
interested in that,” Walesby 
said. “I think our new policy 
will be great, but it’s informed 
by the responses that we 
get from all our campus 
community.”

REPORT
From Page 1A

reflected 
on 
militants’ 

targeting of Pakistani schools.

“It was very numbing to be 

back to the same place and have 
the same emotions resurface as 
a year ago (in Peshawar),” she 
said. “It’s extremely upsetting 
to know that while Pakistan 
has 
progressed, 
there’s 
so 

much work to be done.”

All of the speakers at the 

vigil were either from or still 
had family in Pakistan, and 
shared emotional impact and 
links to individuals affected by 
the violence.

“It’s unfortunate that people 

can’t go to school in safety,” said 
LSA freshman Ramsha Awan, a 
Pakistani-American 
student. 

“And it hits home. It’s where I’m 
from, it’s where my ancestors 
are from. I want those people to 
feel safe and be educated.”

The attack was a part of 

what speakers at the event said 
was a recent spike in violence 
in Pakistan, but many speakers 
challenged the idea of the 
country as a violent state. LSA 
senior Haider Malik, who is 
from 
Peshawar, 
compared 

the militants’ fanaticism to 
the wave of political anger 
sweeping America.

“We live in times where our 

problems are amplified and our 
solutions simplified,” he said, 
citing a recent poll in which 

30 percent of Americans said it 
would be OK to bomb Agrabah, 
the fictitious capital of the 
cartoon Aladdin.

“Think 
about 
the 

juxtaposition. 
Think 
about 

Pakistan. Those people have 
been subject to the same 
demagoguery and rhetoric that 
sways extremist opinion in this 
country.”

Hijab 
said 
political 

ramifications 
aside, 
it’s 

important 
for 
University 

students 
to 
pause 
and 

emotionally 
process 
these 

instances of violence. 

“I 
never 
want 
myself 

or anyone to ever become 
desensitized to the loss of an 
individual,” 
she 
said. 
“We 

can’t be perpetuating the same 
violence and hostility that was 
the root of these shootings … 
and need to recognize that it’s 
OK to feel upset, to feel loss 
and grief, but always honor and 
remember those victims.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

During the past week, I have had 

the pleasure to attend the town hall 
meetings designed to gather student 
input on the University’s diversity 
strategic planning process. It’s clear 
to me, after hearing directly from 
students and reading a thoughtful 
and compelling Jan. 11 Michigan 
Daily essay written by Michigan in 
Color contributors Jamie Tam and 
Velma Lopez, that we have not done 
an adequate job explaining some 
aspects of the planning process. 

While a great deal of important 

information about the nuts and bolts 
of the planning process is posted on 
the diversity.umich.edu website, we 
have been less clear regarding our 
rationale for conducting the plan-
ning process in the manner that we 
have. This lack of clarity has given 
rise to some concerns regarding the 
process itself.

One 
concern 
voiced 
is 
that 

the University cannot be serious 
about diversity because we have 
not announced a specific fund-
ing amount dedicated to tackling 
this issue. Last fall, Yale University 
announced a five-year, $50 million 
initiative to increase faculty diver-
sity. At about the same time, Brown 
University announced a $100 million 
commitment to a wide range of ini-
tiatives regarding diversity, equity 
and inclusion.

While this approach may make 

sense for Yale and Brown, I do not 
believe it is an approach that is right 
for Michigan. First, I believe that our 
planning should drive our funding as 
opposed to our budget driving our 
planning. I am confident the ongo-
ing strategic planning process will 
produce innovative, thoughtful and 
well-considered ideas and initiatives 
that will be targeted at specific mea-
surable objectives. 

While announcing a particular 

dollar amount at the beginning 
of the process may make a strong 
statement, my concern is that it pre-
maturely places a limit on what we 
are willing to spend on diversity, 
equity and inclusion. We want and 
need to be free to go wherever our 
ideas take us.

Second, I believe the best fund-

ing approach is not to have a sepa-
rate diversity funding structure 
but 
instead 
to 
institutionalize 

diversity, equity and inclusion into 
every aspect of the University. This 
approach ensures that the funding 
endures beyond the present climate 
of activism.

Diversity, equity and inclusion 

are core part of our mission. As 
such, it must be part of the every-
day business of the University. The 
best way to do that is to make sure 

the goals and initiatives adopted 
from the planning process are inte-
grated into the regular budgeting 
process. This way, diversity, equity 
and inclusion efforts are not segre-
gated into their own token pot, but 
instead are central to every unit’s 
budget and thus their mission.

Still skeptical? As a psycholo-

gist, I know that the best predictor 
of future behavior is past behavior. 
Within the past year, the University 
has made major funding commit-
ments to significant diversity efforts.

Just last month, the University’s 

Board of Regents approved con-
struction of a new multicultural 
center in the heart of campus. Next 
month, a supplemental educational 
program called Wolverine Path-
ways will launch for students liv-
ing in the Ypsilanti and Southfield 
school districts. Students who com-
plete the program and are admit-
ted to the University are provided a 
four-year tuition scholarship. Last 
fall, we also launched the HAIL 
scholarship program to identify 
high-achieving, low-income stu-
dents from all over the state and 
offer four-year, full-tuition scholar-
ships for those who apply for admis-
sion and are accepted.

As significant as these three ini-

tiatives are, they are by no means 
the only financial commitments we 
are prepared to make. The admin-
istration is committed to finding the 
resources necessary to support our 
strategic plan – and the initiatives 
generated by that planning.

It also is clear from the student 

town hall meetings and from my 
many other encounters across cam-
pus that some people are struggling 
to understand this unorthodox, bot-
tom-up approach to strategic plan-
ning. This approach is unlike any 
other planning process undertaken 
here. And I’m proud of that.

Our approach is intentionally bot-

tom-up. Our goal is to provide every-
one in the university community an 
opportunity to put forth ideas about 
what our objectives should be and 
how we should go about achieving 
them. I believe such an approach 
will not only generate the best ideas, 
but also provide students, faculty 
and staff greater ownership of the 
plans and help empower us all to cre-
ate the change we all want to see in 
this university. 

Make no mistake, the plans we 

develop will not be the administra-
tion’s plans, nor will they be Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel’s plans. The 
plans will belong to all of us. We all 
have a role to play in the develop-
ment of the strategic plan, and are 
all accountable for its implementa-

tion and success.

To date, we have received hun-

dreds of comments and ideas from 
members of our community through 
our various community engagement 
activities and the Be Heard social 
media platform. These comments 
and ideas are being forwarded to 
the appropriate planning leads to be 
evaluated for integration into unit 
and area plans.

Yet, we are not satisfied with 

the level of engagement on this 
critical topic. I urge you to look for 
announcements of more campus-
level and unit-level town hall meet-
ings and other activities in the 
coming weeks.

The key to making this all work is 

the nearly 100 individuals who are 
serving as the diversity leads for their 
respective school, college or unit. 
The diversity leads have the critical 
task of synthesizing a great deal of 
information into a specific plan for 
their units. These are individuals 
who were hand picked by their unit 
leaders to do this important work. 

Most of the diversity leads have 

a history of promoting diversity, 
equity and inclusion in their units. 
A few are relatively new to this 
area. I can attest that these leaders 
are committed to improving their 
units. I also can assure you that 
they have the knowledge and skills 
necessary to lead their units in the 
planning process. 

I have spent 25 years in various 

capacities working to make the Uni-
versity a more diverse, equitable and 
inclusive place. I understand that we 
have a very long way to go before we 
live up to our considerable potential. 
I, too, feel the frustration many of us 
feel that we are not further along. I 
also am under no illusion that the 
strategic planning process will be a 
panacea that will fix everything. 

I am very optimistic and excited 

about what this strategic planning 
process can do. We have an oppor-
tunity to infuse a plan for achieving 
a more diverse community into the 
core mission and operation of this 
university. The planning process 
can be a powerful example of how 
including individuals from diverse 
perspectives and experiences can 
lead to more creative, innovative and 
effective ideas — the perfect embodi-
ment of why a diverse, equitable and 
inclusive community is fundamental 
to academic excellence.

Robert M. Sellers is the University’s 

vice provost for equity, inclusion 

and academic affairs. He is also the 

Charles D. Moody Collegiate Professor 

of Psychology and Education and 

an alumnus of the University.

Second Sexual Misconduct Report reveals we need change
T

he Office of Institutional Equity released its second Student 
Sexual Misconduct Annual Report, showing a 25-percent 
increase in reported cases of sexual misconduct from 2014 to 

2015. In the 2014 reporting period, 129 cases were reported, whereas 
in 2015 there were 172 cases reported. This increase in reports is the 
result of a multitude of factors, including increased media attention 
 

the topic of sexual misconduct has received nationwide and on 
campus in the past several years. This increase is not where we should 
direct our most critical attention, however. What’s most concerning 
about the statistics in the report is the decrease in the percentage 
of reported cases investigated by the Office of Institutional Equity, 
which is the result of the inadequacy of the University’s current 
Sexual Misconduct Policy.

A brief summary of the reporting process 

through OIE is warranted: Sexual misconduct 
under the current policy includes both sexual 
assault and sexual harassment. All reports 
of sexual misconduct are first reviewed by 
the University’s Title IX coordinator, who 
determines whether a given case is a potential 
violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy. If 
a case is in potential violation of the policy, 
the Title IX coordinator sends it to a review 
panel made up of various representatives. 
The panel then decides whether each case 
warrants an investigation. The investigation 
would ultimately determine whether the 
reported case of sexual 
misconduct is indeed a 
policy infraction.

While 
the 
report 

acknowledges that there 
has been an increase in the 
number of cases reported, 
it is misleading when it 
states “the number of 
investigations 
remained 

the same.” While it is 
true that in both 2014 and 
2015 there were 29 cases 
brought 
under 
official 

investigation 
by 
OIE, 

29 cases amounts to 22 
percent of cases reported 
in 2014 and just 17 percent of cases reported in 
2015. This means that despite the 25-percent 
increase in cases reported, we have seen a 
5-percent decrease in the number of cases 
actually investigated by the University.

This is concerning because data from 

the Campus Climate Survey shows that 
sexual assault is much more prevalent than 
the number of cases reported shows. Many 
students are sexually assaulted, but do not 
report the incident or do not wish to follow 
through with an investigation. There is a 
huge discrepancy between the prevalence of 
sexual assault and the number of cases being 
investigated by the University. What can 
explain this gap?

OIE conducts its investigations based on 

the current Sexual Misconduct Policy and 
the evidence the complainant provides. The 
current standard seems to be too weak to 
properly identify situations in which sexual 
assault has occurred, relying on how the 
available evidence interacts with the policy. 
If there is enough evidence to support that 
sexual misconduct occurred within the 
definitions of the policy, then the reported 
instance is considered an infraction. If there 
is not enough evidence to support it, then, 
according to the policy, no violation occurred.

In an ideal world, the sexual misconduct 

policy 
would 
always 
reprimand 
sexual 

misconduct where it is due. But statistics 
in this report clearly show this is not the 
case — especially regarding instances of 
sexual assault, which made up 25 of 29 cases 
investigated. Of these, OIE just found seven 
cases to be in violation of the policy. You read 
that right. In 2015, the University only issued 
sanctions to seven perpetrators of sexual 

assault, barely an improvement from last 
year’s five.

The current Sexual Misconduct Policy is 

not doing its job. Two terms are of utmost 
importance when discussing the effectiveness 
of a sexual misconduct policy in bringing 
cases of sexual assault to justice: consent and 
incapacitation. Consent in the current policy is 
defined as “clear and unambiguous agreement, 
expressed in mutually understandable words 
or actions, to engage in a particular activity.” 
The policy goes on to say that a person 
cannot give consent if they are incapacitated, 
incapacitation being defined as “lacking the 

physical 
and/or 
mental 

ability to make informed, 
rational 
judgments.” 

According to the policy, this 
inability to make rational, 
informed judgments could 
include 
“being 
asleep 

or 
unconscious, 
having 

consumed alcohol or taken 
drugs, 
or 
experiencing 

blackouts or flashbacks.”

Both of these definitions 

are 
inadequate. 
Who 

is to determine what is 
“clear” or “unambiguous” 
agreement? Who is to 
determine whether these 

signs were “mutually understandable?” What 
does it mean to make “informed, rational 
judgments”? The current policy’s definitions 
of consent and incapacitation are entirely too 
subjective and must be improved.

This fall, OIE released a draft of a Revised 

Student Sexual Misconduct Policy. Breaking 
sexual misconduct into six subcategories all 
under the umbrella of “Prohibited Conduct,” 
the draft adds that consent cannot be inferred 
from silence, or an existing or previous sexual 
or dating relationship, while also elaborating 
that 
consent 
with 
one 
person 
doesn’t 

constitute consent with anyone else and 
that consent can be withdrawn at any time. 
While these are improvements, the draft still 
maintains the subjective language of “clear” 
and “unambiguous” agreement as grounds 
for consent. The changes the draft makes to 
the definition of incapacitation are negligible, 
leaving it just as subjective as the current 
policy.

If OIE considers defendants in cases of 

alleged sexual assault to be innocent until 
proven guilty, the subjective nature of 
definitions of consent and incapacitation 
make it virtually impossible to prove the 
defendant committed sexual assault. An 
adequate sexual misconduct policy, which the 
University claims to be releasing soon, should 
define consent and incapacitation in much less 
subjective terms. Only then can we expect 
the percentage of reported cases investigated 
to increase, and only then can we expect the 
University to reprimand more than seven 
cases of sexual assault per year. In response to 
this report, we reiterate the call to action we 
made nine months ago: Clear, unambiguous 
action is required. 

Outdated intramural policy
G

rowing up privileged in the 
affluent suburb of Bethesda, 
Md., meant that, fortunately, 

I 
never 
truly 

experienced 
hard-hitting, 
blatant 
sexism. To my 
knowledge, 
I 

was never denied 
any opportunity 
because 
of 

my 
sex, 
or 

had 
violence 

directed 
against 
me 

solely 
because 

I am female. Looking back on my 
childhood, I’ve become more aware 
of how role models, like my parents, 
teachers and rabbis, made clear, 
decisive moves to remind me again 
and again that anything a boy could 
do, I could do, too.

Here at Michigan, we largely live 

in an academic and cultural environ-
ment where overt, external sexism 
is hardly commonplace or tolerated. 
However, the rosy world in which 
I thought I lived in, one in which 
men and women are truly viewed 
as equal, is not realistic. Sexism and 
misogyny still exist in our world 
today, but largely in subtle ways that 
can be easily disregarded by detrac-
tors. Furthermore, this prejudice dis-
proportionately impacts those who 
are the least likely or able to draw 
attention to it — women of color and 
of low income.

However, as important as it is to 

highlight this pervasive institution-
alized sexism that denies women 
opportunities and undermines our 
ability to exercise agency, I’m plac-
ing that aside to discuss a rather 
curious piece of University policy 
that, though governing something 
comparatively innocuous, I still find 
troubling. No, it doesn’t have to do 
with anything as serious as the wage 
gap in the University’s payroll or the 

ever-prevalent problem of sexual 
assault, and the subject of the policy 
doesn’t have far-reaching, damaging 
consequences that echo throughout 
society. But neither of these realities 
mean it should be neglected.

Here at the University, women are 

treated differently than men when 
they step on the field to play certain 
intramural sports. This is the result 
of something called “co-rec modifi-
cations,” a different set of gendered 
rules enshrined in the official online 
rule book posted on the Student Life 
Recreational Sports page. After a bit 
of digging through the back pages 
of the website, I found a whole set 
of rules that alter game play for 
intramural flag football if women 
are present on the field. There are 
different rules regulating plays and 
passing, and the advent of something 
called an “illegal male advancement” 
(which, to me, sounds like a bulky, 
technical term for sexual assault) 
that bans male players from being 
“the first player to advance (carry) 
the ball beyond the line of scrim-
mage,” when, in turn, there are no 
such restrictions “on any run by a 
female player at any time.” And when 
a woman scores a touchdown, she 
wins nine points for her team, but 
when a man scores, he earns six.

Though I’ve heard of rule modi-

fications being in place for other 
intramural sports, such as indoor 
soccer and inner-tube water polo, 
there are no official co-rec modi-
fications in any other online rule 
book except for flag football. Pre-
sumably, these rules, both official 
and unofficial, aim to soften game 
play to make it easier, and thus 
more “fair,” for the women who 
choose to participate. However, 
they’re founded on flawed logic that 
instead has the potential to corrode 
both women’s success on the field 
and women’s will to go out and 
“play with the boys.”

Don’t get me wrong — it’s impor-

tant to recognize and address the 
unique challenges women face every 
day. Denying the fact that a woman 
may experience the world around her 
differently because of her sex allows 
for a false sense of enlightenment and 
results in complacency, when in real-
ity, there’s much work to be done. But 
treating women differently in intra-
mural flag football isn’t a progres-
sive step toward greater equality. 
The gendered rules unnecessarily 
draw a hard line between men and 
women, and predict a woman’s abili-
ties before she’s even stepped foot on 
the field. All in all, they do more harm 
than good.

The fact that we have these dif-

ferent sets of rules for co-rec sports 
was just as surprising to me as it 
was to most people I talked to. A 
quick, informal canvas of my peers 
produced a fairly unified response 
of “Wow, really? That seems so … 
outdated.” And it is — to me, the 
policy seems oddly antiquated, and 
rubs against the overwhelmingly 
progressive and inclusive environ-
ment the administration actively 
tries to perpetuate.

Though we cannot kid ourselves 

and forget that gender relations 
in contemporary America are not 
nearly as “enlightened” as we like 
to think, this relic of a policy is 
based on the logic that in sports, 
men have such an overwhelming 
physical advantage over women 
that the rules should be crafted to 
make the sport easier for us when 
we’re playing together. Superim-
posing equality onto co-rec intra-
mural sports actually helps women 
by bolstering our ability to compete 
with and against men. The rules 
must be changed to fall more in line 
with the University’s consistent 
progress toward greater gender 
equality, both on and off the field.

Michigan set for exhibition

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Fresh off a series against Ohio 

State that featured a win and a tie, 
the No. 7 Michigan hockey team 
won’t play any 
Big Ten games 
this week.

Instead, 

following 
two of their 
most dramatic 
games 
of 

the year, the 
Wolverines 
have 
their 

second 
and 
final 

exhibition 
of 

the season on 
the horizon.

Michigan 

and Ohio State combined for 
24 goals, and the Wolverines 
recovered from three-goal and 
two-goal deficits Friday and 
Sunday, 
respectively. 
After 

Sunday’s match, a brawl broke out 
after the final buzzer to punctuate 
the showdown. 

Now, Michigan will face the 

U-18 
United 
States 
National 

Talent 
Development 
Program 

on Thursday for the 16th time in 
program history.

Though there aren’t any points 

up for grabs in the contest, there 
is something else worth taking 
the ice for.

“This is like a home game for 

them when they play a Division I 
team,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “I don’t know if any 
Division I teams have come to 
play in their rink. But typically 
they play on the road. They know 
some of our players, and some of 
our players played in the program, 
so there’s some bragging rights 

going on.”

The Wolverines (5-1-2 Big Ten, 

14-3-4 overall) have maintained 
the majority of those bragging 
rights — boasting a 13-2-0 all-
time record — but will be short-
handed for the matchup, partly 
due to the consequences that 
were handed down from the 
Big Ten following the postgame 
fiasco against Ohio State.

Sophomore defenseman Cutler 

Martin and sophomore forward 
Dexter Dancs will be unavailable 
as they serve part of their 
respective suspensions.

As for health scratches, junior 

defenseman Kevin Lohan will 
remain out as he recovers from 
a back injury, and sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

could 
be 
sidelined 
with 

“bruising” as well.

With the roster dwindling, 

Michigan will have to use every 
option in the depth chart — 
replacing Martin with sophomore 
defenseman Sam Piazza and 
slotting 
either 
sophomore 

forward Niko Porikos or junior 
forward Evan Allen in for Dancs.

Despite the currently depleted 

roster, the USNTDP will still 
have its hands full. No college 
program has been able to stifle the 
Wolverine offense, demonstrated 
by their nation-leading average of 
4.86 goals per game.

Even more intimidating is the 

fact the Michigan’s first line is 
made up of three Hobey Baker 
candidates who have scored 16 
goals in four games.

But that’s not to say the USNTDP 

doesn’t have talent of its own. 

“If you think we’ve got one line 

that is really good — well they have 
one, too,” Berenson said. “Wait 
until you see (Kiefer) Bellows, 
(Clayton) 
Keller 
and 
(Joey) 

Anderson play. They’ll be giving 
our D fits, so this will be good.”

Five future Wolverines will 

also lace up to play the team they 
will be a part of next year.

The exhibition provides the 

quintet with a unique opportunity 
to get a taste of what it’s like to 
play at their future school and 
to make an impression, a feeling 
Michigan 
freshman 
forward 

Brendan Warren knows well.

“Last year, I was super excited 

to be able to play at my future 
school,” Warren said. “This year, 
it’s kind of cool playing against 
the program where I used to be. 
The Big Ten is kind of a gritty 
game. … The (USNTDP has) been 
playing together for two years, 
and they’re going to be a pretty 

well-oiled machine. It’s gonna be 
totally different playing against 
guys that are super structured 
and really skilled.”

It will be a low-stakes game for 

the Wolverines. A loss wouldn’t 
jeopardize their Pairwise ranking. 
A win won’t improve their résumé.

But pride is on the line, and 

Berenson doesn’t expect anything 
less than the typical production 
from his team.

“We’re going to play hard and 

fast, and there’s going to be some 
physicality,” Berenson said. “But 
we don’t want any nonsense, we 
don’t want any stupidity, we don’t 
want a penalty-filled game. We 
want it to be a real good hockey 
game. They’re a skilled team and 
they’re fast.”

games, clearing out full lower-
bowl sections to create a more 
student-driven environment.

The catch-22, Hackett said, 

is obvious — the games students 
want to attend most will be 
those for which season-ticket 
holders are least willing to trade 
their seats. 

“The economic pressure was 

to build economic loyalty so we 
could remodel Crisler Arena 
(in 2011),” Hackett said. “So 
this is a paradox of the highest 
order. The students make the 
environment. … When I was 
here in the 1970s, it was a gift 
to get a ticket down low because 
the students didn’t really have 
seats.

“It was really limited — they 

stood in line all night to buy 
them. Now, this is so much 
more, but you see around the 
country how important it is to 
have that band,” Hackett said, 
gesturing to the half-ring of 
students who flank the court on 
Crisler Center’s north and west 
sides.

Hackett might not have much 

time left to implement the idea, 
however, as he and University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

announced in December that 
the search for a long-term 
athletic director is ongoing.

Hackett provided no update 

on the timetable Wednesday, 
stressing 
that 
his 
personal 

willingness to stay on until a 
decision is reached has made 
for a relaxed and relatively low-
pressure search.

“We’re right in the middle of 

it,” Hackett said. “You know, the 
great news is that I don’t have to 
fly out of here, so the president’s 
proceeding with great care and 
consideration, looking at lots 
of candidates. So I’m really 
optimistic we’re going to get a 
great answer there.”

Michigan 
softball 
coach 

Carol Hutchins is the lone coach 
on the seven-member search 
committee 
Schlissel 
created 
in 
early 

December, 
but 
Hackett 

said he’s been 
receiving 
input 
from 

a 
range 
of 

coaches, both 
via 
Hutchins 

and 
through 

his own conversation, saying 
he had spoken Wednesday with 
men’s basketball coach John 
Beilein and hockey coach Red 
Berenson, among others.

Among 
Hutchins’ 

responsibilities is to regularly 
poll other coaches for their input, 
and 
Hackett 
characterized 

his communication with all 
Michigan coaches as a “constant 
dialogue.” 

Hackett, 
of 
course, 
also 

maintains a constant dialogue 
with his highest-profile hire — 
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh. Hackett declined to 
directly confirm reports that 
Harbaugh will move a portion of 
the Wolverines’ spring practices 
to the IMG Sports Academy 
in Florida, but said Harbaugh 
has 
relatively 
free 
rein 
in 

determining practice logistics, 
as do all coaches. 

“Last year, he did ‘Class on 

the Grass,’ and I thought that 

was quite innovative,” Hackett 
said, referring to last year’s 
marathon 
spring 
practices, 

which were often as long as four 
hours. “Spring ball is a time 
where they make tremendous 
strides. … Certainly last year, 
they had a new coach, and they 
were excited about proving 
themselves. 
So 
any 
ideas 

that 
build 
enthusiasm 
and 

excitement are really smart. 
So you can attribute any kind 
of practice thing in any of the 
sports to the coaches.”

As 
Harbaugh 
innovates, 

however, Berenson is seeing 
success with much the same 
script that has brought him 
success throughout his 30-year 
tenure as Michigan’s hockey 
coach.

Berenson’s 
retirement 

has long been rumored to be 
imminent, but Hackett said 
little regarding the prospect 
that he’ll orchestrate another 
high-profile coaching search in 
the coming months as hockey 
season winds down.

“With respect to Red and 

what he’s meant to Michigan 
— he’s a legend, and isn’t it 
amazing, 
by 
the 
way, 
the 

number of legendary coaches 
we’ve had here? — I don’t want 
to diminish his year at all by 
speculating what his future 
is,” Hackett said, emphasizing 
that Berenson’s future is in 
Berenson’s hands alone. “The 
ceremony of his status is going 
to be very precious to me, 
so that’s why I’m saving the 
outcome of that question until 
the right time.”

Hackett 
did 
acknowledge 

Berenson, whose Wolverines 
are off to a 14-3-4 start, will 
have a higher-than-typical level 
of control over the search for his 
successor.

“Yes, it’s fair to say that,” 

Hackett said. “I’ll tell you why — 
Bo (Schembechler) did, and John 
Beilein is going to. What you 
have in them is someone really 
proximate to the competitive 
environment, what’s it take, 
the recruiting at Michigan, 

particularly if 
they’ve 
been 

successful. 
If 

you 
haven’t, 

then 
you’re 

adopting 
a 

different 
theology, 
so 

to speak. But 
here’s a guy 
that’s 
been 

legendary. 
I 

tell you, I love 

all the coaches … he’s a special 
guy to work with.”

Hackett and Berenson had 

to work together under the 
wrong circumstances this week, 
however, as the Wolverines 
continue to deal with the fallout 
of a brawl during their 8-6 win 
over Ohio State on Sunday. The 
Big Ten handed down a three-
game 
suspension 
to 
Cutler 

Martin for punching a player 
already subdued by a linesman, 
a 
punishment 
Hackett 
said 

Michigan will accept without 
appeal.

In other news, Hackett seems 

intent on adding to his ever-
growing popularity in his time 
at the University, as MLive and 
the Detroit Free Press reported 
separately on Wednesday that 
Hackett planned to donate half 
of his $600,000 earnings to 
Athletes Connected, an athlete-
specific wing of the University 
Depression Center.

Another tough home test 
lies ahead for Wolverines

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

Two players by the name of 

Kelsey Mitchell will step onto the 
Crisler Center court Thursday 
evening — one 
of 
them 
for 

Michigan, 
the 

other for Ohio 
State. 
One 
of 

them 
recently 

notched 
personal highs 
for 
her 
first 

career 
double-

double, and the 
other is second 
in 
the 
entire 

country, 
and 

first in the Big 
Ten, in scoring.

Michigan 
senior 
forward 

Kelsey Mitchell and Ohio State 
sophomore guard Kelsey Mitchell 
will meet for the first time in their 
careers Thursday night, when the 
Michigan women’s basketball team 
(3-3 Big Ten, 11-6 overall) hosts the 
seventh-ranked Buckeyes.

Mitchell, 
the 
Buckeye, 
is 

averaging 25.3 points, 2.7 rebounds 
and 2.1 steals. Last year, she led the 
nation in scoring and helped Ohio 
State reach the Sweet 16.

“Ohio 
State 
has 
everyone 

returning from a great season 
last year,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico in her weekly 
interview with WTKA. “(Ohio 
State’s Mitchell) is one of the top 
players in the nation. She’s just an 
incredible scorer.”

The Buckeyes (5-1, 13-4) don’t 

need to rely solely on Mitchell, 
though, as they have a solid, 
balanced attack force alongside 
her. Guard Ameryst Alston, who 
is averaging more than 18 points 
per game, and forward Alexa 
Hart (10.8 points per game, 6.7 
rebounds per game) have been 
making themselves heard as well.

Mitchell, the Wolverine, was 

injured last season for both games 
against Ohio State. Michigan split 
the season series, with both teams 
winning at home.

This year, the two teams meet 

only once in the regular season, 

which could help or hurt Michigan. 

Last week, Michigan nearly 

took down now-No. 5 Maryland, 
but fell behind late when Mitchell 
and 
freshman 
center 
Hallie 

Thome got into foul trouble.

Michigan added a loss to the 

record, but more importantly, it 
gave up the chance to snag a big win 
against a top-ranked opponent. 
The Wolverines have put up 
performances similar to that one 
earlier this season, nearly beating 
now-No. 20 UCLA, but they still 
lack a marquee win to boost their 
NCAA Tournament aspirations.

Just like the Maryland and 

UCLA 
matchups, 
Michigan’s 

opponent Thursday is the favorite, 
but a win would significantly aid 
the Wolverines’ resume.

With 
the 
way 
Michigan’s 

Mitchell has been playing lately, 
the Wolverines will have a fighting 
chance. Against Iowa in early 
January, she had 15 points and 11 
rebounds, both career highs.

“I don’t remember playing like 

this since high school,” Mitchell 
said after the game.

The 
senior 
forward 
has 

sustained multiple injuries over 
her four years at Michigan, and 
she barely saw any playing time 
until this year. At the beginning 
of the season, Barnes Arico 
praised her impressive preseason 
performances, and even felt like 
she might have a breakout season 
similar 
to 
former 
Wolverine 

forward Cyesha Goree.

Sunday, the Wolverines left 

Penn State with their first win in 
State College since 2001, thanks 
in part to a performance from 
Flaherty, who scored 23 points on 
5-for-10 shooting. 

However, the Nittany Lions are 

no Buckeyes.

“(Ohio State is) gonna be tough,” 

Barnes Arico said. “They’re off to a 
great season. They do the dribble 
drive. They try to draw fouls. They 
shoot the 3 exceptionally well. 
They’re gonna be another great test 
and great game for us at home.”

Michigan coach John Beilein’s team didn’t play its best basketball Wednesday, but pulled out a win over Minnesota.
‘M’ overcomes 
shooting woes

Wolverines fail 
to pull away from 
Minnesota, but 
hold on for win

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

To kick off Wednesday’s 

halftime entertainment, two 
fans were given the opportunity 
to make a half-court shot and, 
in 
doing 

so, win a 
free Delta 
Airlines flight to a U.S. city of 
their choosing. Within seconds, 
as one feeble attempt after 
another failed to reach the free-
throw line, much less the rim, 
it became readily apparent that 
neither contestant was leaving 
the state of Michigan for free 
any time soon.

The duo’s only success was 

in impersonating the half it had 
just witnessed — a mistake-
riddled period that saw the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team’s 15-point lead whittled to 
a 37-30 deficit by halftime.

Unlike 
the 
fans, 
the 

Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 14-5 
overall) figured it out in the end, 
denying the Golden Gophers 
(6-13, 0-7) their first Big Ten 
victory, 
74-69. 
Michigan 

appeared lucky to be playing a 
Big Ten bottom dweller, though, 
as it struggled in all aspects of 
the game.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

turned the ball over just six 
times, their mistakes came 
mainly in their shot attempts, 
as even their elite shooters had 
little success finding twine.

It took some shaking and 

baking 
from 
junior 
guard 

Derrick Walton Jr. to get the job 
done. Walton saved possessions 
late in the shot clock numerous 

times with twisting, scooping 
baskets at the rim, finishing 
with 22 points.

“I tried to steal a little bit from 

the Stephen Curry package,” 
Walton said.

But even Walton struggled 

from the field, shooting just 
1-for-6 from 3-point range. As 
Minnesota kept the margin 
in 
single 
digits 
throughout 

the game, Walton’s 11-for-12 
free-throw shooting made the 
difference. The point guard’s 
performance 
from 
the 
line 

brought Beilein a sigh of relief, 
having minced no words with 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman moments 
earlier before Abdur-Rahkman 
shot a one-and-one.

“I had tried to be positive 

with him and told him to make 
his damn foul shots in the 
huddle,” Beilein said. “So that 
really worked. He went out 
there and made them.”

Sharpshooting 
redshirt 

sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson shot just 3-for-12 
from the field and missed an 
uncharacteristic seven times 
in 10 attempts from 3-point 
range. 
The 

Wolverines 
collectively 
shot 
23-for-

63, 
and 

the 
teams 

combined 
to 
shoot 

an 
anemic 

15-for-53 from 
3-point range.

“He 
got 

some really good looks,” Beilein 
said of Robinson’s seemingly 
flukish 
performance. 
“He 

practices so much. … He’s got 
to pick his pockets to practice. 
They tell me how many 3s he 
makes before the game — it’s like 
hundreds. I can assure you, and 
I was away recruiting, that on 
the day off (Monday), he found 

his in there, with obviously no 
instruction from us, and had 
some manager come, and made 
a couple hundred.” 

As strange as Robinson’s 

performance was, the first half’s 
final sequence, which entailed 
junior walk-on Andrew Dakich 
attempting a jump shot with his 
foot on the 3-point line, was odd 
as well. The shot rimmed out 
and into the hands of sophomore 
forward 
Ricky 
Doyle, 
who 

missed a point-blank attempt at 
the buzzer.

Another peculiar moment 

saw redshirt freshman forward 
D.J. Wilson miss a second-half 
dunk only to find the ball in 
his hands seconds later in the 
same spot. The ensuing missed 
layup might as well have been 
the theme of the night for 
Michigan, which didn’t put 
Minnesota 
away 
until 
the 

game’s final minutes.

Walton’s 3-pointer with just 

over six minutes remaining 
in the game gave Michigan a 
nine-point lead that it clung to 
as it the clock dwindled toward 
all zeroes.

The Wolverines showed an 

impressive 
ability 
to 

fight through 
Minnesota’s 
uncommon 
approach 
on 

guarding ball 
screens.

“They 

defended 
it 

differently 
than 

anybody’s defended all year 
long,” Beilein said, divulging 
only 
that 
the 
speed 
of 

Minnesota’s frontcourt players 
afforded the Golden Gophers 
extra flexibility in how they 
helped and switched.“We’ve 
just got to have a different 
strategy or be better at what 
we do.”

Irvin, Walton make 
difference in victory

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

If 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team’s upset of then-
No. 3 Maryland was a pretty 
performance — just the right mix 
of 3-point bombs, high-energy 
defense and timely shooting 
— 
Wednesday’s 
win 
over 

Minnesota at Crisler Center was 
downright ugly.

The Wolverines couldn’t rely 

on the 3, shooting just 29 percent 
from beyond the arc — 13 percent 
below their season average. Even 
their most prolific sharpshooter, 
redshirt sophomore guard Duncan 
Robinson, clanked multiple wide-
open attempts off the back of the 
rim in the first half and shot an 
abysmal 3-for-12 from the floor in 
the game.

And they certainly weren’t 

playing 
high-energy 
defense 

either, 
allowing 
the 
Golden 

Gophers — who remain winless 
in their seven Big Ten games — to 
close the first half on a 9-0 run 
and stay in the game well into the 
second half.

But luckily for Michigan, even 

when the rest of its offense seemed 
to be asleep — Minnesota outshot 
the Wolverines 42 percent to 37 
— its two on-court junior leaders, 
forward Zak Irvin and guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., came ready to 
play, and that was enough to allow 
Michigan to narrowly escape with 
a 74-69 victory.

On a night when his teammates 

shot a combined 15-for-46 and tied 
the rebounding battle with one of 
the worst rebounding teams in 
the conference, Irvin came out 
strong with 19 points and a team-
high 11 boards. Irvin didn’t make 
a basket in the last 17 minutes of 
the game, but he helped carry the 
Wolverines with 15 points in the 
first half.

“Guys need to step up,” Irvin 

said. “I had to go through that a bit 
last year with Derrick and (senior 
guard Caris LeVert) being out, 
so I’m used to it now. It’s a team 
game — all of us are just trying to 
do what we can.”

In the second half, it was 

Walton’s turn to take over. Like 
most of his teammates, Walton 
didn’t have a great shooting 
performance — he made just five 
of his 13 shots — but in the second 
half, he made 10 of 11 free throws 
and a big 3-pointer to help ice the 
game for the Wolverines.

“Derrick’s been playing with 

great poise, especially once we got 
into the Big Ten (season),” Irvin 
said. “He’s been able to be there 
when things are going tough for 
us. He was able to make some big 
shots tonight when we couldn’t 

really get the ball in the basket.”

And 
crucially, 
Walton’s 

performance at the line proved to 
be the difference for a team that 
hadn’t gotten into many free-
throw battles late in games — 
Beilein said the only true example 
of that this year was at North 
Carolina 
State 
in 
December, 

where LeVert sank eight of eight 
foul shots down the stretch to seal 
a victory.

The victory wasn’t especially 

pleasing to Beilein, the fans or 
the players, but in the end the 
Wolverines were still proud to say 
they had successfully closed out 
the game.

“It wasn’t a pretty win,” Irvin 

said, “but it was gritty. We had to 
do the things we don’t normally 
have to do — we had to fight.”

New slang: 
how lit 
was the 
function?

“That’s literally me af.” “The 

party is gonna be turnt!” “Sarah 
Jessica Parker is bae.” “I’m so 
hungry rn.” “Yaaasss queen!” 
“LMAO, I’m dying!” “The club 
is hella lit tonight.” “Netflix and 
chill?”

If you’ve heard any of the 

following phrases, you have either 
encountered a millennial or are 
one.

In every generation, people are 

primarily defined by the period 
in which they live. And in each 
period, a variety of zeitgeists define 
the culture of the moment. They 
can range from fashion to film, 
music to art and TV to literature. 
But perhaps the most significant 
of them all is language, specifically 
the slang used by the generation of 
the time. For millennials — people 
born between the early 1980s and 
the early 2000s — the current slang 
is notable for its hyper-condensed 
diction and common usage in 
social media. In addition to that, 
millennials have created their 
own language through texting, 
and in many cases embedded it 
into everyday talk. Even regularly 
used words, such as “literally,” 
“awkward” and “dying,” have 
completely new meanings within a 
millennial context. We don’t often 
realize it, but millennial slang 
and texting language play active 
roles in our daily lives, whether on 
our phones, on social media or in 
regular conversation. 

Slang

Considering its mass appeal, 

slang has played an integral part 
of the culture in each generation. 
In the 1950s, an age swept up 
in conservative values, young 
people used “swell” as their very 
own colloquialism. “Cool” and 
“groovy” made their way into the 
counterculture of the ’60s and 
’70s, eventually paving the way for 
words like “wicked” and “sweet” 
in the lively era of the ’80s and the 
grunge scene of the ’90s. The early 
’00s contained a slew of slang like 
“redic,” “redonculous,” “whack,” 
“dope” and “sick” that spewed 
from the mouths of the youth. 
These words aimed to go against 
the traditional vernacular, as well 
as to give a collective personality 
to the people who uttered them. 
Nowadays, slang is just as creative 
and innovative as before, yet it’s 
changing at a breakneck speed.

While movies, TV shows and 

music have become crucial in 
influencing slang both in the past 
and in the present, the increasing 
omnipresence of social media and 
social networking have provided 
millennials with platforms onto 
which we can constantly send 
and receive written and spoken 
messages. 
Through 
popular 

sources like Facebook, Instagram, 
Twitter, Snapchat, Tumblr and 
Vine, millennials have more access 
not only to new information, but 
also to the most up-to-date lingo. 
According to Julie Coleman, author 
of “The Life of Slang,” words are 
moving around the world within 
weeks and months because of 
social media. “It’s not necessarily 
that language is changing more 
quickly,” Coleman writes. “But 
technologies have developed and 
they allow the transmission of 
slang terms to pass from one group 
to another much more quickly.”

Indeed, 
several 
of 
these 

technologies 
have 
determined 

the way in which millennials 
communicate with one another, 
especially with the invention 
of Twitter and its distinctive 
140-character limit (at least for 
now). 
Several 
news 
websites, 

such as MTV.com and Buzzfeed, 
have adapted millennial slang 
into their headlines and articles 
(i.e. “21 Bold AF Hair Colors 
To Try In 2016”). Through the 
interconnected environment of 
the Internet, millennial slang 
has also been influenced by the 
reinvention of memes — humorous 
images, videos, GIFs or texts that 
are copied and spread online. 
Since the first well-known meme, 
the popular “Kilroy was here” 
graffiti in the 1940s, the “meme” 
has become a modern worldwide 
phenomenon on the Internet and 
other social media platforms. One 
of 2015’s most pervasive was a man 
screaming “What are those?!” at 
a police officer’s shoes. Memes 
may not necessarily be considered 
language, or even slang for that 
matter. However, through the 
technological advancement of the 
Internet, they do carry a cultural 
significance that has shaped the 
way millennials communicate and 
understand one another.

In addition to social media and 

Internet memes, celebrities seem 
to hold some influence over the 
way in which language pervades 
the psyche of the millennial 
generation. Around 2010, rappers 
Soulja Boy and Lil B helped 
popularize the word “swag” in 
their songs “Pretty Boy Swag” 
and “Wonton Soup,” respectively. 
Throwback to middle school. 
In 2011, hip-hop artist and pop 
culture icon Drake publicized the 
acronym “YOLO” (which stands 
for “you only live once,” for those 
still living under a rock) in his rap 
anthem, “The Motto.” This past 
year, DJ Khaled, the famed music 
producer behind the ubiquitous 
pump-up jam “All I Do Is Win” and 
other hits, became a prominent 
source of entertainment, when he 
shared his own catch phrases on 
his Snapchat story. Whether he 
was riding on a jet ski in the dark or 
watering his plants, almost every 
one of DJ Khaled’s Snapchats had 
the producer saying, “Bless up,” 
“The key to success” or “They 
don’t want you to … ” to whomever 
was watching. Given his larger-
than-life personality, 2.8 million 
Instagram followers and major 
popularity on Snapchat, DJ Khaled 
is among many of today’s celebrities 
who exude the spirit and mood of 
the millennial generation.

Millennial slang may as well 

be a way in which we distinguish 
ourselves from other generations, 
but there does seem to be larger 
social implications within the 
language itself.

“Young people are interested 

in expressing themselves in a 
distinctive way that makes them 
feel like they’re part of something,” 
said 
Communications 
Prof. 

Scott Walker Campbell, who is 
also a mobile communications 
researcher 
at 
the 
University. 

“The fact that millennials have a 
distinctive way of speaking and 
some distinctive lingo doesn’t 
make the generation distinctive, 
because my generation did the 
same thing.”

As Campbell also points out, 

slang is simply a cultural trend 
that every generation has, yet 
it manifests and looks different 
within different generations.

“It’s what generations do,” 

Campbell 
said. 
“They 
come 

together, have distinctive qualities, 
distinctive tastes in music, in 
fashion and also in language.”

Perhaps slang is more than 

just a reflection of the current 
culture. Perhaps it’s a subtle 
rebellious response to our parent’s 
generation. But more importantly, 
the slang that’s used today can stem 
from a desire to be recognized, a 
drive to become viral and leave a 
cultural legacy behind.

“There are new ways for 

individual people to have a voice 
and participate in a network and 
system of communication that 
is kind of unlimited,” Campbell 
said. “It’s not about money, 
but about being clever and 
entertaining and cool.”

This leads to the idea that 

people who use slang online and 
on social media are accruing 
commercial value. In this age 
of virality, hashtags and instant 
celebrity, millennials want to be 
recognized and slang is a way 
in which they can do that, not 
just within the realm of social 
networking, but with the rest of 
society. 

Texting language

In addition to slang, texting 

has developed into a language 
of its own for millennials. With 
the revolution of the modern cell 
phone in the early 2000s, texting 
has dramatically affected the 
communication millennials use 
in their everyday lives.

“Millennials 
are 
certainly 

using their thumbs as much or 
more than we’ve seen in past 
generations,” Campbell said.

Because 
texting 
involves 

quick, 
rapid-fire 
responses, 

a 
methodical 
process 
has 

been cultivated as a result, 
where commonly used words 
and 
phrases 
have 
become 

abbreviated. 
Some 
examples 

include “to be honest” changing 
to “tbh,” “very” into “v” and 
“okay” 
into 
the 
universally 

abhorred “k.” 

“There’s this idea that texting 

is chaos and that young people 
don’t know how to use grammar,” 
said English professor Anne 
Curzan. “But I think it’s very 
systematic.”

As an educator and historian 

in the field of the English 
language, Curzan understands 
that older and younger people 
have very different perceptions 
on the way language is used 

today, specifically with changes 
in punctuation. An example she 
uses to demonstrate this idea to 
students and adults is the word 
“okay.” She writes the word three 
times — one by itself, one with a 
period and one with a dot-dot-dot. 
When shown to younger people, 
all three words have very different 
meanings, with “okay.” invoking a 
sense of seriousness and “okay … 
” invoking a feeling of skepticism. 
For the older individuals observing 
the three words, they have no idea 
what the difference is.

“If you actually ask prolific 

texters under the age of 30 
how they are doing this, they 
can tell how to use the correct 
punctuation,” Curzan said.

Millennials also pay very close 

attention to every single detail in 
our texts, so much in fact that we 
tend to nitpick at our words out of 
fear that the person on the other 
end of the conversation will take 
the message in the wrong way.

“There’s this idea that younger 

people in this generation don’t care 
about language,” Curzan said. “I 
just don’t think there’s evidence 
for that. I talk with students, and 
they are very attentive with details. 
Spoken and written language is 
how we present ourselves to the 
world.”

Curzan 
also 
believes 
that 

texting is “rapid and very much 
like a dialogue, but you can’t see the 
person most of the time.” However, 
as she mentions, texting has 
adapted to try to create some form 
of tone and emotional expression 
through acronyms like “lol” and, 
more recently, emojis. By using 
these shortened forms of written 
speech, millennials are better 
able to express themselves in new 
and interesting ways. Emojis have 
particularly grown in popularity 
ever since their international 
inclusion on the iPhone. They 
have revolutionized and enhanced 
textual communication by literally 
emoting the thoughts and feelings 
of the person behind the phone. 
People can choose from a diverse 
palette of emojis to express 
emotion, whether it’s using “the 
heart eyes” emoji to flirt or the 
“face with tears of joy” emoji 
to show a hysterical reaction to 
something.

As CollegeHumor hilariously 

satirized in a 2014 video, titled 
“How We’ll All Talk in The Future,” 
emojis could potentially find their 
way into colloquial language. The 
clip depicts two young women 
having a conversation using emojis 
instead of words. In the context of 
the video, the emoji of the “face that 
looks like Edvard Munch’s ‘The 
Scream’ ” apparently translates to 
“no way!” This probably won’t be 
the way people will actually speak 
in the future, but the video makes 
a compelling point about how 
powerful and prevalent emojis, 
and texting language in general, 
have become for millennials. 

Lingo as a linguistic merit

Like text messaging, it’s easy to 

dismiss slang as a simple form of 
primitive speech. But for a while 
now, slang has been recognized as 
having linguistic merit, according 
to Curzan.

“Slang is linguistic creativity 

at work,” she said. “Part of being 
human is being creative with 
language and slang is language at 
some of its most creative.”

This seems to be the opinion of 

not only Curzan, but the linguistic 
community at large. Each year, the 
people behind Oxford Dictionary, 
Merriam-Webster 
and 
the 

American Dialect Society, the 
latter of which Curzan is part of, 
decide which words are the oddest, 
most innovative and most popular 
of the year. For most publications, 
the word of the year is chosen 
based on how frequently the word 
is used or how new the word is. 
Most recently, Oxford Dictionary’s 
word of the year technically wasn’t 
even a word; it was the “face with 
tears of joy” emoji. For Merriam-
Webster, the word of the year was 
“-ism.” The American Dialect 
Society chose “they” (referring 
to the singular gender-neutral 
pronoun) as their WOTY. Other 
recent winners for WOTY have 
included 
“#blacklivesmatter,” 

“hashtag,” “app” and “tweet.” 

As informal as slang can be, it 

shapes culture both universally 
and exclusively. It gives a voice to 
generations and morphs constantly 
with the changing of technology 
and media. But most importantly, 
as linguist Stephen Pinker once 
said, language itself “is not so much 
a creator and shaper of human 
nature so much as a window onto 
human nature.”

That’s pretty lit.

MILLENNIAL LINGO

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 Blend together a unicorn, 
an artistically original J-Pop 
Britney Spears and the entire 
city of Tokyo 
— whatever 
image comes 
to mind, what-
ever hybrid 
creature that 
produces, 
the result is 
Grimes.
 Maybe I’m 
living under 
a rock music-
filled rock, but the first I ever 
heard of Grimes was two 
months ago upon the release 
of her critically acclaimed Art 
Angels. The unusual synthpop 
sound that Grimes has mas-
tered is part of what makes 
her album so intriguing; noth-
ing produced in 2015 is any-
thing like Art Angels. Grimes 
is first and foremost an artist 
— being a musician is just a 
small part of who she is, and I 
think that really shows in her 
latest music video for “Kill V. 
Maim.”
 The first time I listened to 
“Kill V. Maim,” I envisioned a 
slightly more badass Princess 
Peach from Mario Kart zip-
ping through a neon-lit Tokyo. 
It turns out that either I’m psy-
chic or Grimes is really good at 

making you visualize her world 
the way she wants you to see 
it because the music video for 
“Kill V. Maim” is pretty much 
what I imagined two months 
ago. It’s fun. It’s artsy af. It’s 
unlike anything out there.
 Grimes and a sexy squad 
of posh punks take over our 
screens for four minutes and 
thirty-seven seconds in what 
appears to be a video game. The 
video cuts between shots of the 
outlandishly dressed characters 
dancing and zooming through 
what appears to be a neon-
lit Tokyo (defs psychic) with 
Snapchat-esque drawings of little 
halos, hearts and other doodles 
fluttering in and out to further 
define the video as a Grimes pro-
duction.
 From a purely visual stand-

point, the “Kill V. Maim” music 
video is perfection; it has a way 
of sucking you into the world 
Grimes has created for us — the 
world that Grimes probably 
inhabits in her dreams. It’s a col-
orful, outlandish, science fiction 
world full of possibilities. How-
ever, the video seemingly lacks a 
story or purpose — at first I hated 
it for lack of substance. It’s only 
when you pay close attention to 
every detail that you realize how 
provocative it really is.
 I’m not going to disclose my 
interpretation of the video with 
you mainly because art is and 
should be viewed and understood 
differently by each individual — 
but also partly because I have no 
idea what the fuck I just watched.

New cheese bar open

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Ann Arbor is becoming an 

even more creative and dynamic 
food community with uniquely 
structured restaurants — such 
as places that are known for 
reliable 
staples, 
pop-ups 
and 

other partnerships. They give 
local businesses space to try 
nontraditional ideas and offer an 
ever-changing blend of locally 
sourced meals for a new audience 
looking to try something new. 

Spencer, a wine and cheese 

bar/restaurant, has recently taken 
root in Ann Arbor with a focus on 
serving a menu that constantly 
changes with the seasons. Its airy, 
communal seating space creates 
a shared experience in which the 
diner trusts the restaurant to serve 
interesting and high quality meals 
rather than deliberately seek out 
a specific dish fulfilling his own 
cravings.

Co-founder Steve Hall notes, 

“In the last couple of years there 
have been a lot of changes (in the 
Ann Arbor food community), like 
more creative and small things 
popping up … We are tying into a 
similar audience who has eaten 
everything in Ann Arbor and is 
looking into some new sorts of 
foods.”

“The nice thing about changing 

all the time is that we’re not 
any kind of restaurant,” Hall 
continued. “There’s no one cuisine, 
so if we get an idea that’s like ‘hey, 
I’m really excited about doing 
some duck legs this week,’ Abby 
and I will be like, ‘oh, we’ll do 
them sort of like French Alsacian-
German, so let’s do some mustard-
braised cabbage and some roast 
turnips,’ and we’ll sort of run with 
that for a week.”

Their cheese and charcuterie 

brings to light a lesser-known 
market 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Hall 

laments 
in 
particular 
how 

underappreciated Zingerman’s is 
for their cheeses.

“It’s not just sandwiches; I know 

that all students think it’s just 
only sandwiches,” he said. “Their 
cheeses are just some of the best in 
the country and you can taste all of 

them.”

There are many considerations 

that go into the cheese-making 
process, Hall said.

“You think about the animals 

and how they’re treated, you 
think about what those animals 
were eating, you think about the 
season of when they’re eating,” 
he said. “Is it winter and they’re 
eating dry hay or in the middle of 
summer when they’re eating fresh 
grasses and flowers and stuff? All 
that to the size of the production, 
the care of the cheesemaker, the 
age, how it’s been transported, all 
of it down the line. I think a lot of 
people don’t consider that and just 
think, ‘that cheese is $30 a pound, 
that’s a ridiculous price.’ Well, no, 
it’s awesome. It’s way underpriced 
because people really, really care 
for cheese.”

One of the most important 

aspects of creating a dynamic 
culinary culture in Ann Arbor is 
for both diners and restaurateurs 
alike to be adventurous and keep 
an open mind. Being willing to 
mix new ingredients and flavors 
signals that innovation is welcome.

For example, Hall urges people 

to try different types of cheeses.

“I think a lot of people think 

that, ‘oh, I ate goat cheese on a 
salad once and I thought it was 
really weird and I didn’t like it, 
I therefore don’t like any goat 
cheese,” he said. Well that’s 
ridiculous. I don’t like American 
cheese but it doesn’t mean I don’t 
like any cow’s milk cheese.”

Additionally, 
pop-ups 
and 

collaborative events between local 
businesses bring fresh takes to the 
way people traditionally interact 
with food.

Before Spencer opened shop 

a few months ago, owners Hall 
and Abby Olitzky did multiple 
pop-up events: a weekly menu 
of dishes at Braun Court bar — 
wine, cheese and book pairings 
with Literati and a seasonal five-
course dinner using ingredients 
from Zingerman’s. In addition 
to establishing local connections 
for the pair after moving to Ann 
Arbor from San Francisco, pop-
ups offered space to take creative 
liberties and test new ideas that 

liven up the local food scene.

Hall says pop-ups taught them 

about “what people are looking for, 
what do they respond well to, and 
how do we best get to that?” which 
helped identify what elements 
from San Francisco’s vibrant food 
community they could successfully 
implement in Ann Arbor. Both 
budding entrepreneurs and storied 
establishments can benefit from 
partnerships, as well as being 
willing to reach outward to the 
community to see what they are 
interested in while designing a 
menu.

There 
are 
many 
other 

businesses in Ann Arbor that 
also play with unique restaurant 
structures to satisfy a modern 
audience that craves flexibility 
without sacrificing quality and 
health. Babo sheds the distinction 
between grocery store versus 
restaurant with a cheeky, “well, 
it’s both!” Like Spencer, Babo also 
has communal seating inside, 
but supplements it with separate 
tables outside, giving a range of 
options for solo munching, on-the-
go meals or a catch-up between 
friends.

The People’s Food Co-op, a 

communal-membership 
grocery 

store that has been a staple in Ann 
Arbor since 1971, features a similar 
hot bar and coffee shop concept in 
the adjoined Café Verde. This is an 
extension of their goal to provide 
reasonably priced, fresh, healthy 
food from local farmers, according 
to their website. They also offer 
many ways to get involved in the 
community through the food, 
with free classes about eating 
and health and events for co-op 
members.

Though Ann Arbor restaurants 

are typically known for delivering 
reliable and well-made favorites, 
there is a growing audience out 
there looking for elements of 
novelty and creativity in how 
they engage with food. And with 
new businesses like Spencer and 
Babo opening their doors, or 
historic local fixtures like People’s 
Food Co-op and Zingerman’s 
participating 
in 
pop-ups 
or 

changing things up, it’s clear that 
there are places ready to deliver.

“I think it would be a great 

time for men, basically, to go on 
vacation. There isn’t enough work 
for everybody. Certainly in the 
arts, in all genres, I think that 
men should step away. I think 
men should stop writing books. 
I think men should stop making 
movies or television. Say, for 50 
to 100 years.” - Eileen Myles in 
an interview with the New York 
Times, Jan. 2016

***
Paraphrasing 
Myles’s 

declaration in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily, Theatre and 
Drama Prof. Holly Hughes echoed 
and elaborated on this sentiment, 
one inspired by her career as a gay 
and women’s rights performance 
artist at Women’s One World 
Cafe Theater. Published this 
past November, Hughes’s book 
“Memories of the Revolution: 
The First Ten Years of WOW 
Cafe Theater,” anthologized the 
monologues, performances and 
plays presented by WOW Cafe 
during her time there.

“One of the jokes we used to 

tell was that we were all feminists 
who were kicked out of other 
feminist groups for having the 
wrong haircut,” Hughes said.

A hidden gem of the feminist 

and gay rights movements in 
the ’80s, WOW Cafe, presented 
experimental 
theater 
written 

and performed by members at a 
small theater in the East Village 
of New York City. Consisting 
of a room, twenty seats and no 
backstage, 
the 
participants, 

passionate about their material, 
would dedicate days and nights 
to maintaining the theater and 
practicing performances. Trivial 
tasks like taking out the garbage 
and putting away props didn’t go 
unnoticed, for it was a cooperative 
and needed all the help it could 
get to survive.

From 
performances 
titled 

“Paradykes Lost” to “Fear of 
Laughing on the Lower East 
Side,” no subject was considered 
taboo and with twenty seats, it 
wasn’t hard to sell out a show. This 
“uncooperative cooperative,” as 
they called themselves, although 
edgy and ahead of its time, made 
little impact on the feminist and 
gay scene in New York City while 
it existed. 

“It was so freeing … a lot 

of the performers there were 
in the process of coming out 
even though there were always 
heterosexual women,” Hughes 
said. “You just had to be fine 
hanging around a bunch of dykes. 
You had an audience that was 

dealing with issues that existed 
nowhere else. It doesn’t mean that 
everything we did was loved, but 
not everything we did flopped. 
It’s different to perform in front 
of an audience that wants you to 
get better than with an audience 
that is completely clueless and 
doesn’t care.”

The 
freedom 
and 
liberty 

associated 
with 
incorporating 

unspeakable 
topics 
into 

performances 
is 
one 
of 
the 

principle aspects that attracted 
Hughes to WOW. Leaving behind 
her waitressing job in Kalamazoo 
after college graduation, Hughes 
headed out to New York City, 
an unfamiliar land, to pursue 
an education as a painter at 
the recently created New York 
Feminist Art Institute.

“I had an early onset fear of 

missing out thirty years before 
that term was invented,” she said. 
“Realizing all these exciting social 
changes are happening, art is 
happening, I needed to leave.”

Though this institute didn’t 

last long as an innovative form 
of art education, but it did 
expose Hughes to the stories 
she wished to tell as a woman 
and the experiences that shaped 
her. Coming across a flyer that 
proclaimed “XX Christmas Party 
for Woman,” Hughes found her 
entrance into WOW Cafe, a world 
of provocation and eccentricity 
that would consume her life for 
the next ten years.

From members such as poet 

Eileen Myles to recent Tony 
Award winner Lisa Krone, WOW 
sent off into the world confident 
women set on achieving their 
goals. Despite the mainstream 
success of some of its members, 
little attention is granted in 
general to the importance of 
this early onset experimental 
theater organization. Feminism, 
in a modern sense, is promoted 
by celebrities and comedians, 
people with major influence over 
the public opinion. It is publicized 
and brought to the forefront of the 
media’s attention.

Hughes described WOW Cafe 

as a “zeitgeist that made people 
like Shonda Rhimes and Tina Fey 
possible.” The movement that 
began in a small theater thirty 
five years ago has, without anyone 
noticing, catapulted forward the 
feminist movement.

But 
in 
the 
’80s, 
despite 

their “cheekiness and give-no-
fucks 
attitude” 
the 
material 

WOW 
presented 
was 
rooted 

in vulnerability. Pouring their 
hearts, souls and struggles into 
their performances, the women 
at WOW needed the “colossal 
indifference” garnered from the 

East Village. It allowed them to 
experiment, break taboos and 
move mountains all in the comfort 
of the East Village box that had 
become their home.

Hughes, on the other hand, 

achieved mainstream attention in 
a drastically different way from 
other members. Involved in a case 
against the National Endowment 
for the Arb, NEA vs. Finley, 
Hughes spent three years of her 
life fighting appeal after appeal 
until reaching the Supreme Court. 
The case centered around a NEA 
veto of grants for her, two other 
homosexual artists and a woman 
of color in abidance with a law 
passed in 1985 requiring the NEA 
to consider “general standards of 
decency and respect” along with 
artistic merit in awarding funds.

“The history of art is the history 

of provocation and they [Congress] 
didn’t embrace it,” Hughes said. 
“They either ran away, didn’t do 
anything or aided and abetted it.”

Had the work she presented for 

funding been reviewed or even 
looked at by those vetoing it? No, 
but because she identifies as a 
lesbian, her work was considered 
homoerotic 
and 
immediately 

dismissed, Hughes said. In the 
end, the four were granted their 
funding, but the law withholding 
funding remained along, Hughes 
said, with the label that “Holly 
Hughes is a lesbian and her art 
is highly of that genre.” A label 
that, if anything, represents the 
ignorance and intolerance of the 
’90s.

Resulting 
from 
her 
time 

at WOW Cafe, Hughes has a 
unique perception on the world 
of women struggling with their 
identity. Having witnessed the 
obstacles faced by her peers, 
Hughes wishes to impart the 
same sense of empowerment she 
received at WOW Cafe onto her 
female students and provide a 
similar stimulating environment.

“It’s my privilege and honor to 

be a teacher here and help foster 
their art, but I still see in my 
class so many of my young female 
students don’t have the same 
belief and confidence in their 
work as my white, cisgender male 
students,” she said.

It 
is 
this 
difference 
in 

confidence that Hughes strives to 
change in her students. Though 
she has made valiant efforts, 
it must be realized that the 
fundamental treatment of men 
versus women, especially in the 
art world, is a societal problem. 
Confidence cannot be fixed by 
a single teacher alone, but if, 
say, men spent about 50 years 
separated from the art scene, we 
might stand a chance.

SINGLE REVIEW 

 Halfway through his monstrous 
90-bar verse, Kanye spits, “I 
know some fans who thought 
I wouldn’t 
rap like this 
again / But the 
writer’s block 
is over, emcees 
cancel your 
plans.” He isn’t 
kidding.
 “No More 
Parties in 
L.A.,” origi-
nally teased at 
the tail-end of 
his last release 
“Real Friends,” 
is many things. It’s Kanye’s 
exhaustion with plastic L.A. 
life. It’s the reveal of the long 
rumored Kendrick collabora-
tion. It’s a renewed jab at Amber 
Rose (after all these years!). It’s a 
reminder that Kanye really can’t 
stand that goddamn laptop thief 

of a cousin.
 But above all, this is the return 
of a man who wants (needs) to 
prove himself. Yeezus, while 
critically acclaimed for pro-
duction and experimentalism, 
was by no means Kanye’s best 
rapping. His screaming on “I 
Am a God” was arguably more 
powerful than its verses, and 
there were lines throughout 
the album like “In a French-ass 
restaurant / Hurry up with my 
damn croissants.” Humorous, 
yes, but not always in the right 
way. 
 It always takes audacity to 
invite the lyrical king of rap onto 
your track. There’s the risk — 
perhaps the expectation — that 
Kendrick will eclipse whoever’s 
track he graces. Who else was 
even on “Control”? It’s almost 
naïve of Kanye, or any modern 
rapper, to think they could han-
dle or even match him. But Kanye 

takes on the challenge with not 
just a fervor, but absolute fire, 
reminding us that there are still 
other kings who reign. 
 The result is a stunning tag-
team track that manages to run 
over six minutes in just two 
packed verses. It’s strikingly 
old-school — and that goes 
beyond the Madvillany-evoking 
production by Madlib himself. 
The tight and lengthy verses 
recall ’90s and early ’00s hip-
hop classics, where hooks are 
subservient to bars and produc-
tion accompanies rather than 
controls. That killer Kendrick 
line from “Hood Politics” is hov-
ering in the air: “Critics want to 
mention that they miss when hip 
hop was rappin’ / Motherfucker, 
if you did, then Killer Mike’d 
be platinum.” It’s not just Killer 
Mike who’s repping tradition.
 And of course it ends with a 
swish. — Matt Gallatin

Lee explores utopia

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

“Utopia” is a fancy word that 

means asking and answering 
the question: what do we want 
to 
see, 
what 

do we want to 
happen? Young 
Jean 
Lee, 
a 

former aspiring 
Shakespearean 
scholar 
and, 

according 
to 
Chris 

Isherwood 
of 
The 
New 

York 
Times, 

“the 
most 

adventurous 
downtown 
playwright 
of 

her generation,” 
puts 
forward 

two responses 
in 
her 
plays 

“Untitled 
Feminist Show” 
and 
“Straight 

White Men.” Lee will be giving 
a lecture at 5:10 p.m. at The 
Michigan Theater through the 
Penny Stamps Lecture Series on 
Thursday, Jan. 21.

“ ‘Untitled Feminist Show’ is a 

carousing exploration of a world 
where gender is recognized and 
celebrated in all its fluidity and 
freedom,” Lee wrote in an e-mail 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. Featuring six fully nude 
dancers whose only props are pink 
parasols, this hour-long, wordless 
show creates a space where the 
idea of gender becomes freedom 
and not a constraint, stigma, 
marginalization 
or 
violence 

toward gender nonconforming 
people. Lee explained how the 
play is a space of freedom — for 
example, one of the performers 
does not identity either as male or 
female.

“ ‘UFS’ was about creating 

a utopia, and in our utopia, 
that freedom of identification 
was possible ... For me, fluidity 
of 
identity 
(which 
‘Untitled 

Feminist Show’ celebrates) is an 

acknowledgment that we can’t 
shove people into categories of 
identity,” Lee wrote. “The show 
isn’t about being a women vs. 
being a man. It’s about showing 
people who were born with 
female-coded bodies who are able 
to transcend these types of gender 
distinctions.”

The term utopia can also pose 

the question: what is off about 
what we want to see? For Lee, 
“Straight White Men” was a 
kind of experiment in character 
identification 
and 
in 
asking 

the 
question, 
what 
should 

straight white men do with 
their privilege? As she recounts 
in an interview with American 
Theater; its beginnings stemmed 
from a workshop.

“When I was at Brown doing 

the first workshop, there was a 
room full of students, people of 
color, and queer people, a very 
diverse room. And then they 
started talking very harshly about 
straight white men. I said, ‘Okay. 
Now I know all the things you 
don’t like about straight white 
men. Why don’t you give me a 
list of all the things you wished 
straight white men would do that 
would make you hate them less?’”

She continued, “So they told 

me all these things, and I wrote 
down the whole list, and then I 
wrote that character. And they all 
hated him. They hated him.”

Lee, described her writing 

process in an interview with 
BOMB Magazine as “failing over 
and over and over and over and 
over and over again,” thrives 
when she is putting her audiences 
(and herself) between rocks and 
hard places. As she says in the 
same interview, “The maxim 
is basically I try to think of the 
worst idea for a show I could 
possibly think of.”

It’s easy to see how a show like 

“Straight White Men” fits the 
bill, which features four straight 
white men (three sons and a 
father) whose gathering around 
Christmas is the launchboard 
for 
exploring 
straight 
white 

masculinity. (For the straight 

white male readers, have you ever 
thought about how you won’t 
go to get a sweater even when 
it’s too cold for the t-shirt you’re 
wearing? That’s one question that 
one scene examines, as Lee and 
the cast describe in this video 
interview.) Their identity comes 
under scrutiny as Lee loosens 
straight white male identity as 
the “default position,” she said 
in a video interview with Public 
Theater NY.

“I asked myself, ‘If I woke up 

tomorrow and I was a straight 
white man, what would I do?’ 
” Lee wrote. “That’s where the 
existential crisis came up for me, 
because it would be one thing 
if I woke up as a straight, white 
man who never thought about his 
identity and enjoyed his privilege 
unthinkingly — that might feel 
kind of good. But if I were to 
wake up with my own mind in a 
straight, white body, it would be 
completely problematic.”

Lee’s 
theatrical 
diptych 

approaches 
questions 
about 

identity from two directions. 
What if you were stuck in this 
identity that isn’t yours, whose 
privilege comes at the expense 
of violence toward everyone 
else? What if you had absolute 
freedom in your identity? Lee, 
who regularly voices her dislike 
of preachy, didactically political 
theater, has put forward two 
works 
that, 
though 
written 

separately, are an innovative 
venue 
for 
engaging 
with 

questions of identity. These are 
questions that are essential and 
uncomfortable for Lee, who 
describes growing up Korean-
American in a predominantly 
white community where she 
was forced to deny her ethnic 
heritage.

“I think that they are both 

looking toward the future — 
‘SWM’ looks toward a future that 
might be imminent, and ‘UFS’ 
a future that may never come,” 
Lee wrote. “They both point to a 
world where we define people in 
different ways than we have in the 
past.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

TRAILER REVIEW

 I thought that, in 2016, it 
was impossible to use Queen’s 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” in any 
kind of new 
or interest-
ing way, but 
whoever cut 
together the 
new trailer 
for “Suicide 
Squad” was 
somehow able 
to breathe new 
life into a great 
but incredibly 
tired song.
 I have no idea if I’m actually 
going to see “Suicide Squad” — 
comic book movie fatigue, ya 
know? — but even as just a two-
and-a-half minute work, this 
trailer is pretty great, and it 
does a brilliant job of manipu-
lating the Queen song — a full 
cinematic work in itself — so 
that it doesn’t actually steal the 

spotlight away from its stars.
 The trailer begins with shots 
of its main characters along 
with lyrics that underscore 
their unbalanced mental states. 
We see a lot of Will Smith and 
Margot Robbie throughout, but 
while Smith plays what seems 
like a pretty standard tough 
dude unfamiliar to comics 
fans, Robbie nails the fucked-
up whimsy of Harley Quinn. 
Her grin as she’s joking (or 
being completely serious) about 
the voices her in head is price-
less. Meanwhile, there’s also a 
crocodile, a girl possessed by 
a witch and a bunch of white 
dudes who look vaguely famil-
iar from other movies. Oh, and 
Jared Leto is trying way too 
hard as the Joker.
 From then on, it’s a lot of 
punches, gunshots and explo-
sions set to rocking guitar 
without any real context to the 

story. We have no idea what’s 
going on, but “Bohemian Rhap-
sody” makes it OK, because it’s 
great to see the song in a fresh 
context (I’m sure whoever 
made this trailer loved “Guard-
ians of the Galaxy”). That said, 
even the voiceover set-up is a 
little too bluntly honest about 
what we really want from 
this movie, simply stating 
that the characters are going 
“somewhere really bad” to do 
“something” that will get them 
killed. Hey, at least it’s got a lot 
of fire and attitude.
 Though the reality is that 
“Suicide Squad” probably won’t 
be different from any other 
comic book movie that comes 
out this year, the trailer still 
manages to feel exciting and 
cool. And who knows, maybe 
Robbie’s Harley Quinn alone will 
be worth the price of admission.

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Daily Arts Writer

Winter break is nothing if 

not an endless buffet of volup-
tuary temptations. Almost two 
weeks at home in San Diego and 
another in Chicago offered up 
the requisite enchiladas from 
my 
family’s 
go-to 
Mexican 

place, Thai green curry for Star 
Wars screenings, a lazy brunch 
of frittata and a citrusy kale 
salad, a luxuriant New Year’s 
Eve feast in a subterranean den 
that began with risotto and 
ended with chocolate cake and 
then plenty of dark, muddy red 
wine that stained my lips crim-
son, Bloody Marys with extra 
horseradish and whiskey cock-
tails that staved off the Chica-
go chill — among other things.

But January is the icy month 

of atonement, a thought that 
echoed when I opened my 
refrigerator — after a long and 
decadent birthday weekend in 
Chicago — to reveal its spartan 
shelves and the lone survivors 
who had grimly soldiered on. 
When replenishing the refrig-
erator seems a particularly 
insurmountable 
challenge, 
I 

want a dish that comes together 
not from an involute choreog-
raphy performed by a troupe 
of ingredients, but arises from 
a few good alliances between 
wholesome, leafy compatriots. 
And when the weather takes on 

the climate of a refrigerator, I 
want something that simmers, 
boils and melds into itself on the 
stove. In short, what I longed 
for was lentil soup, the humble 
little dish that is both edifying 
and indulgent. The lentil har-
kens back to Ancient Grecians, 
who very much enjoyed them; 
their playwright Aristophanes 
said “you, who dare insult len-
til soup, sweetest of delicacies,” 
perhaps a hair defensively, in 
one of his plays.

The soup starts with a gener-

ous gloss of olive oil in a big pot 
— more than you would think 
necessary at the peak of New 
Year’s austerity — and a roughly 
chopped bouquet of vegetables: 
1 carrot, 1 yellow onion, 1 leek, 
3 cloves of garlic. But the magic 
of lentil soup is its chameleon 
form — substitute celery for the 
carrot, green onions for the leek 
and shallots for the onion, or 
whatever other root vegetables 
lurk in your pantry. The point is 

to chop as finely as you have the 
patience for, but uniformity is 
little prized. I chop roughly and 
quickly.

Sauté in olive oil until every-

thing has compressed and their 
aroma begins to make your 
kitchen feel hospitable again. 
After 10 minutes, add a very 
long glug of whatever wine 
or beer you have and a cup of 
dried green lentils, plus a can of 
crushed San Marzano tomatoes 
and another 2-3 cups of water. 
Stir and bring to a simmer. Add 
a palmful of salt, a pinch of hot 
smoked paprika, some stalks 
of thyme or bay leaves and a 
squeeze of lemon juice that will 
cut through winter. After this, 
cover and walk away.

45 minutes is enough time to 

read half of the London Review 
of Books you were gifted for 
Christmas, or for the more 
abstemious, take a brisk and 
nippy walk. And in 45 minutes, 
the hard, little lentils soften 
into velvet, and the shards of 
carrots, onions, leek, tomatoes, 
and garlic deliquesce into a silky 
base. The lemon and dark wine 
lend a richness to the stock not 
often found in vegetarian fare. I 
ladle it into a saucer and drizzle 
with more lemon and a shower 
of green onions, but it is equally 
good with a few drops of olive 
oil, a piece of au courant avoca-
do toast, or a handful of simply 
dressed arugula. 

Dear Gillian,

Not that anyone really says 

“sleep with somebody” anymore, 
but I literally don’t like sleep-
ing with other people. I find it 
anxiety-
inducing 
and awk-
ward and 
I 
never 

sleep 
well. 
On 

the 
other 

hand, 
I 

don’t want 
to be rude 
or 
sexist. 

Is 
sleep-

ing 
with 

someone 
essential to 
intimacy?

Thanks in advance,

 – Awkward in Ann Arbor

Dear Awk,
The poets say yes: sleep in your 

lover’s embrace. But the sleep sci-
entists say no: love your lover, but 
sleep alone, and if you need an 
embrace, try a pillow.

T.S. Eliot’s “A Dedication to my 

Wife” celebrates sleeping side by 
side as an embodiment of love and 
companionship: “To whom I owe 
the leaping delight / That quick-
ens my senses in our waking time/
And the rhythm that governs the 
repose of our sleeping time, / the 
breathing in unison.”

Yet scientific sleep studies have 

shown that bed partners not only 
breathe in discordant meter, but 
their body movements, duvet 
thefts, insomnias, and snores dis-
rupt one another’s sensitive and 
precious sleep cycles, which may 
leave couples resentful and want-
ing to punch one another.

There are probably a number of 

reasons that “sleeping with some-
one” came to be a euphemism for 
intimacy. Not only do they natu-
rally follow one another, but they 
both find us at our most vulner-
able and therefore require deep 
trust. Visual artists more typical-
ly portray a sleeping figure alone. 
Look at the contemporary painter 
Kehinde Wiley, who plays with 
western art historical iconogra-
phy and Black identity in his piece 
“Sleep,” drawing from the poses 

and imagery of both a solitary 
and graceful sleeping figure like 
“Giorgione Sleeping Venus and 
a fallen martyr like Carvaggio’s 
“Deposition and Entombment of 
Christ.” But when a second figure 
does share the sleeper’s canvas on 
occasion, there’s often a nod to 
voyeurism, discomfort or indigni-
ty. A classic example is Botticelli’s 
“Mars and Venus,” Venus watches 
alert as Mars slumbers unguard-
ed and exposed.

Their frequent metaphoric link 

to death is another bond between 
sleep and intimacy. The French 
call the latter “le petit mort” 
and the idea of sleep as a kind of 
temporary or reversible death is 
ubiquitous in the history of the 
arts. How about the final scene 
in Romeo and Juliet: she’s asleep, 
he thinks she’s dead, he kills him-
self, she wakes up, sees him dead 
and kills herself. Or look at John 
William Waterhouse’s “Sleep 
and his Half-brother Death.” 
Awk, your anxiety about sleep’s 
vulnerabilities — sleeptalking, 
or flailing about, or worse — is 
understandable.

Back in the day, when hous-

ing was scarcer, beds fewer and 
heating more primitive, shar-
ing beds, even with strangers, 
was not uncommon. Your feel-
ings of awkwardness about it 
are reflected throughout litera-
ture. Think Cassio and Iago in 
“Othello” getting their legs tan-
gled or the great scene in “Moby 
Dick” leading up to Ishmael and 
Queequeg sharing a bed at the 
Inn. It’s enough to make you leave 
the flannel robe and teddy bear at 
home.

One reason sneaking out in the 

dark hours of the night is consid-
ered sleazy, though, is that spend-
ing the night bridges the hours 
between the alluring evening of 
seduction, revelry and intoxi-
cation and the sober daylight 
of visibility, reality and reflec-
tion. George Balanchine’s ballet 
“La Sonnambula” (“The Sleep-
walker”), based on the opera of 
Vincenzo Bellini, explores the 
relation between the world of 
sleep, magic and dance and that of 
waking life with the pas de deux 
between The Sleepwalker and 
The Poet. Dorothy Parker’s Short 
Story “You Were Perfectly Fine” 
published in The New Yorker in 

1929, captures the abrupt panic of 
being yanked from one state to the 
next — recalling one’s drunken 
behavior the night before with the 
person next to you in the morning. 
Besides the obvious issue of con-
sent in a drunken hookup, seeing 
your lover through to the morning 
helps dispel or confirm the fear 
that Parker’s “lovely things” in a 
supposedly pivotal moment in the 
romance exist in only one half of 
the two’s collective memory.

Don’t worry AAA, there are 

some steps you can take with-
out sacrificing your beauty sleep 
or having to have a sleepover 
before you are ready. You can ask 
your boo to brunch and share the 
bonding pleasure of coffee and 
omelets without the prerequisite 
of sharing a bed beforehand. Or 
perhaps an afternoon movie at 
one of your homes where you can 
practice snuggling, or even a low-
stakes siesta as in Jean-François 
Millet’s “Noonday Rest.” In the 
meantime, the best way to avoid 
coming off as rude or sexist is to 
communicate, explaining exactly 
why you’re trekking through the 
snow back to your house at three 
in the morning instead of stay-
ing cozy, even if it sounds like an 
excuse. 

So no, Awky, sleeping with 

someone is not essential to inti-
macy; but intimacy, at least the 
meaningful version, does suggest 
that you should probably find a 
way to get comfortable with the 
sleeping part. Once you get to 
know your love interest on a few 
different levels, lit by both the 
sun and the moon, you might feel 
more and more at ease with the 
prospect of spending the night. I 
wonder if there isn’t some kind of 
tech fix for your issue. Have you 
tried something other than dorm-
issue twins, like a nice full or 
queen? How about earplugs? Or I 
know: one of those Sleep Number 
beds advertised on TV.

The point is, if you stick 

around through the dreaming 
until morning or beyond, who 
knows ...

EPISODE REVIEW

 The room goes silent, the 
moment of truth awaits and the 
knife goes in, only to reveal the 
juicy, pink 
center of a 
perfectly 
cooked 
steak. Gor-
don Ramsay 
starts the 
applause 
and the 
crowd goes 
wild. Hungry foodies all over 
the nation salivate as they watch 
celebrities take the “MasterChef” 
stage for a shot to win $25,000 on 
behalf of a charity of their choos-
ing. For the 100th episode, four 

rounds of celebrities rumbled 
through the culinary arena, each 
with their unique mystery box of 
ingredients and 60 minutes for 
the competing stars to live out 
their “MasterChef” dreams.
 First up were “Empire” cast 
members Ta’Rhonda Jones and 
Kaitlin Doubleday, followed by 
a couples’s round with Terry 
Crews (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) 
and his wife Rebecca King 
— Crews battling for the best 
cupcake against Boris Kodjoe 
(“The Last Man on Earth”) and 
Nicole Ari Parker (“Rosewood”). 
Lobsters were poached, cupcakes 
were decorated and Gordon 
Ramsay needed “a touch more 

salt.” But most anticipated in the 
“MasterChef” special was the 
appearance of today’s “it” girl, 
supermodel Gigi Hadid, who 
went head to head with fellow 
Victoria’s Secret Model Devon 
Windsor. Hadid, the self-pro-
claimed foodie of her famous girl 
squad, tore up the kitchen as she 
crossed off one of her ultimate 
bucket list items. Two hours later, 
as the celebrities said goodbye to 
their “MasterChef” glory, the rest 
of the world was just a bit hun-
grier and a lot more skeptical of 
the raving reviews the culinary 
professionals dished out to the 
amateur contestants. — Danielle
