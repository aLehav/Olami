Women’s fraternity 

faced multiple 

disciplinary sanctions 

over past months

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily News Editor

The Eta Chapter of Kappa 

Alpha Theta women’sfraternity 
at the University of Michigan was 
disbanded Monday.

A letter obtained by The 

Michigan Daily from Theta’s 
national president Laura Doerre 
to chapter members states the 
decision was made in a unanimous 
vote by the fraternity’s grand 
council on Sunday.

In the letter, Doerre said the 

decision to disband the chapter 
came after several suspensions 
and disciplinary action from both 
the University and the national 
chapter, 
including 
a 
recent 

suspension effective during the 
spring semester. The letter didn’t 
specify what events prompted 
the 
disciplinary 
actions 
or 

suspensions.

Doerre also wrote that the 

fraternity 
recently 
violated 

University sanctions that were 
administered during the Spring 
semester.

“On February 10, Vice-President 

Mandy Wushinske and I visited 
campus and met with members 
of your cabinet and university 
administrators including the dean 
of students,” Doerre wrote. “At 
that time it was clearly stated that

Joint faculty and 

student committees 

await approval of 
reccomendations 

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Silke-Maria Weineck, chair of 

the Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs, discussed 
student course evaluations at 
Monday’s 
Senate 
Assembly 

meeting, updating the assembly 
on their initiatives to create 
policies 
for 
the 
release 
of 

evaluations.

Last fall, the Faculty Senate 

voted to defer releasing course 
evaluations until policies on the 
release were in place and there 
were changes in the structure 
of the evaluations to be viewed. 
Two committees, composed of 
faculty and representatives from 
Central 
Student 
Government 

were charged with performing 
these tasks.

The 
recommendations 

have been sent to University 
of Michigan Provost Martha 
Pollack for review, Weineck said. 
If approved, course evaluations 
will be released starting fall 2016.

The policies suggested include 

a stipulation that allows course 
evaluations to only be released 
to students, preventing their 
release to other UM community 
members 
or 
the 
public. 

Additionally, course evaluations 
would only be released if one 
of two thresholds are met: a 50 
percent participation rate for the 
class overall or a minimum of 30 
evaluations total per class.

“We 
decided 
to 
put 
the 

threshold 
in 
to 
encourage 

participation,” 
Weineck 
said. 

“The students told us they 
wanted this information, so it 
seemed a good idea to say, ‘OK, 
you can have this, but you need to 
provide the information as well.’”

Another 
suggestion 
made 

by the committee was to allow 
faculty 
facing 
difficult 
life 

situations or emergencies to opt 
out of release of evaluations for 
that year.

Chris Hughes gives 

advice to young 
entrepreneurs at 
Business school

By REBECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

Audience members browsed 

Facebook 
on 
their 
phones 

while waiting for one of the 

social media site’s creators 
to speak in the Robertson 
Auditorium Monday evening.

Allison Davis-Blake, dean of 

the Stephen M. Ross School of 
Business, moderated the event. 
She asked Chris Hughes about 
a number of topics, including 
his journey as one of five people 
co-founding 
Facebook, 
his 

work for the Obama campaign 
in 2008 and the advice he 
had for young entrepreneurs. 
Facebook was founded in 2004 

by Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin 
Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin, 
Andrew 
McCullum 
and 

Hughes. The social media site 
now has more than 1 billion 
users in 19 countries.

Hughes 
began 
the 

discussion with a disclaimer: 
the 
Facebook 
story 
was 

different from that portrayed 
in the popular 2010 film “The 
Social Network.” Rather, he 
said, 
a 
few 
undergraduate 

students at Harvard University 

had the idea for a social media 
site and with the right spark 
and motivation, Facebook was 
able to become the massive 
network it is today.

He 
told 
attendees 
that 

a small idea can have a 
significant impact on making 
a huge difference in the world: 
Facebook, he said, began with 
the simple idea to connect 
friends and family and 12 years 
later, the site has evolved into

Monday evening, Ann Arbor 

City Council convened for its 
first work session on the city’s 
fiscal year 2017 budget, which 
is slated to be passed in May. 
Staff retention in the Ann 
Arbor Police Department and 
funding for the city’s ongoing 
deer cull were among the most 
contentious budgeting factors 
discussed at the meeting.

Ann 
Arbor’s 
budget 
is 

determined over a two-year 
process, and this is the second 
year in that process. However, 
City 
Treasurer 
Matthew 

Horning said there are still 
many important new factors to 
consider.

“It’s a much easier process 

than last year, but we still 
have some decisions to make,” 
Horning said at the start of the 
meeting.

Larry Collins, Ann Arbor’s 

interim 
community 
services 

area administrator, discussed 
funding for the city’s ongoing 
deer cull.

The deer cull was initially 

budgeted as a one-time cost of 
$20,000 for 2017, but Collins 
said the actual cost of the 
project will be around $35,000.

Collins said no current bill 

exists to account for the total 

costs of the cull. Before the cull 
began, the city agreed in its 
contract with the United States 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 

Animal 
and 
Plant 
Health 

Inspection Service to receive 
a bill at the end of the first 
quarter of the process. The cull 
began Jan. 2, 2016.

Collins said he was unsure 

how much the culling activities 
will cost in the upcoming 
years. A city meeting to discuss 
potentially 
using 
nonlethal 

methods for the cull will be held 
with city residents on Friday.

“We just don’t have the data 

yet … we’re not done,” Collins 
said. “My hope and my belief 
is that $35,000 won’t be needed 
for the cull in the upcoming 
year.”

Ann Arbor residents have 

complained since the summer 
of 2015 about the lack of 
transparency from city officials 
regarding the cull’s costs and 
the details and effects of the 
cull.

Councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1) said she 
disapproved of Collins’ inability 
to provide clear parameters of 
the cost of the cull. Collins said 
he does not know at this time 
the amount of funding required 
to complete the deer cull.

City 
Administrator 
Tom 

Crawford 
promised 
to 

provide Briere and other city 
councilmembers with written 
updates containing information 
about the costs of the deer cull. 
He did not specify when those 
updates would be distributed.

During event, 

speakers emphasize 

problem solving, 
community equity

By KEVIN BIGLIN

Daily Staff Reporter

At the Ford School of Public 

Policy 
Monday 
evening, 

panelists discussed ways police 
reform in Cincinnati can serve 
as a model for cities across the 
United States to adopt a more 
community-based 
approach 

to issues of police brutality, 
touching 
on 
collective 

experience in the field.

The event, “21st Century 

Policing: 
Lessons 
from 

Cincinnati,” was hosted as part 
of the University of Michigan 
2016 Martin Luther King Jr. 
Symposium 
and 
moderated 

by David Thacher, assistant 
professor of Public Policy and 
Urban Planning and Reuben 
Miller, assistant professor of 
Social Work.

In his remarks, Thacher 

emphasized that opportunities 
to implement police reform 
are made possible through the 
work of social activists.

“We’re at a really important 

moment in American policing 
right now,” Thacher said. “We 

have a level of social attention 
to policing and scrutiny in 
policing that we haven’t seen 
in probably about 50 years. We 
have a window of opportunity 
in policing for real and lasting 
change, and we have that 
window because of the passion 
and commitment of so many 
civil 
rights 
activists 
over 

the past two years who have 
put policing in the national 
spotlight so successfully.”

Participants in the talk were 

key members involved in the 
process of Cincinnati’s police 
reform after a series of deaths 
prompted 
a 
lawsuit 
from 

the Cincinnati Black United

Wilkerson, director of Ann 
Arbor’s 
Human 
Resources, 

addressed 
issues 
associated 

with staff retention on the 
AAPD 
with 
the 
council. 

Wilkerson said due to the 
average age of the current 
police force there is an expected 
increase in retirement rates in 
the upcoming years.

According 
to 
Wilkerson, 

officers typically retire after 
about 25 years on the job. The 
percentage of officers eligible 
for retirement is expected to 
increase by about 22 percent 
— from 10 percent to about 32 
percent — within the next three 
years.

It is expected there are 

currently four to six Ann Arbor 
police officers who will become 
eligible for retirement between 
now and July, which makes up 
50 percent of the department’s 
staff. If these individuals retire 
as scheduled and positions are 
not filled, the police force will 
be running at half-capacity in 
the coming months.

Wilkerson said the ongoing 

issue of officer retention stems 
from the improving economy.

“With the better economy, 

it takes longer to find good 
candidates to fill the positions,” 

she said. “That goes across all 
jobs, 
including 
managerial, 

nonunion and police and fire.”

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3) said he 
agreed that improvement in the 
economy is making it harder to 
fill these important positions.

“Recession is an employer’s 

job market,” Ackerman said.

Wilkerson 
added 
that 

vacancies in the police and fire 
departments 
are 
especially 

difficult to fill because applicants 
are not hired individually, but 
rather as groups completing 
training together, to ensure 
efficient initial field training, 
which means the positions won’t 
be filled immediately when the 
retirements occur. She said it 
can take 36 to 40 weeks after 
hiring before an officer works 
alone in the field when factoring 
in the extensive hiring and 
training processes.

“There will be vacancies 

between now and July that we 
won’t fill purposefully to make 
sure that we can fill a class,” she 
said.

Jack 
Eaton 
(D–Ward 
4) 

asked Wilkerson whether any 
extra funding designated for 
this initiative would rollover 
for future years, to which 
Wilkerson said the city must 
be adequately prepared and 
responsible for the possibility 
of this situation.

She added that the amount 

of money allocated to new 
officer training will depend 
on how much notice the city 
staff receives prior to officers’ 
retirements and how long it 
takes to hire a replacement.

Crawford said having such 

a vacuum in the force’s staff 
would be an embarrassment to 
the city.

“Almost 
every 
(vacant) 

position feels like it’s a point of 
failure,” Crawford said.

an avenue for sharing photos, 
messaging and advertising.

“It is possible to come from 

the most simple means and 
have an enormous impact on 
the world,” he said.

However, Hughes also said 

for a company to succeed, it’s 
not just about generating ideas 
— entrepreneurs also have to 
think about making those ideas 
into 
successful 
companies. 

He stressed that Facebook’s 
success was not a stroke of luck, 
but an immensely difficult fight 

to get the company to where it 
is today, which he said was a 
key message for entrepreneurs.

“It is a reminder that if you 

want to be an entrepreneur, 
you have to feel like you have 
to build the company,” Hughes 
said. 
“It 
is 
the 
difference 

between having that idea, and 
being so obsessed by that idea 
that you can’t let it go.”

When asked what aspect of 

the social media site he was 
most proud of, Hughes said 
Facebook was the first network 
that enabled people to be truly 
authentic.

“When I think of what I 

am most proud of, it is really 

creating 
an 
environment 

where people can be authentic, 
where people use their real 
names, where people talked 
about what they actually cared 
about, and connected to their 
friends, family, and eventually 
colleagues and co-workers,” he 
said.

The conversation then shifted 

to Hughes’ impact on President 
Barack Obama’s campaign as 
its online organizer in 2008. 
He used the Internet to foster 
a community of supporters and 
grassroots supporters, allowing 
the 
campaign 
to 
represent 

something larger than Obama 
himself, Hughes said.

Davis-Blake 
asked 
if 

Hughes’ 
efforts 
had 
a 

lasting impact on political 
campaigning. 
Hughes 

noted 
current 
presidential 

candidates’ 
understanding 

of the power of social media, 
and 
pointed 
to 
Donald 

Trump’s “masterful” use of 
Twitter to convey messages 
in particular. Beyond politics, 
he also brought up the success 
of 
technology 
to 
spread 

awareness of ALS through the 
Ice Bucket Challenge in 2014.

“It’s not just about politics,” 

Hughes 
said. 
“It’s 
about 

activism and social change in 
general. If you can come up with 
a concept that resonates with 
people, for a cause that matters, 
and you use the network effects 
well, it can explode.”

Similarly, he said, the drive 

behind Facebook wasn’t to make 
money; it was to bring value to 
the world and make an impact.

“We never started Facebook 

to make money,” he said. “Mark 
Zuckerberg cares more about 
the impact of the world than 
money.”

Hughes 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of having the right 
team when creating a startup, 
saying that not everyone is meant 
to be an entrepreneur — one must 
have the focus and commitment 
to see it through, and the ability 
to deal with challenges.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Ann 

Clinger, 
president 
of 
the 

Michigan-based small business 
Dazzle Pet, said she attended 
the discussion to gain insight 
from someone who was once in 
a position like her own.

“I 
wanted 
to 
get 
some 

inspiration from someone who 
has walked in those shoes 

and seen incredible success, 
and I think the ideas he can 
share with people right on the 
cusp of their own careers is 
invaluable,” Clinger said.

University 
of 
Michigan 

alum Nathan Pilcowitz, who 
works at the safety startup 
Companion, said his interest in 
entrepreneurship inspired him 
to come to the event. Pilcowitz 
thinks Ann Arbor is ripe for 
business opportunities.

“Right 
now, 
more 
than 

ever, there is a spirit of people 
wanting to make something 
huge, and actually make a 
difference in the world. So 
definitely coming here and 
seeing a person our generation 
looks up to is really important,” 
Pilcowitz said. “He is someone 
we can relate to.”

The American Medical 

Student Association, Students 
for Choice and Michigan 
Animal Respect Society each 
tabled in Mason Hall on 
Monday to raise awareness 
about the causes of their 
organizations.

AMSA members 

encouraged students to 
register as organ donors in 
their respective states. In an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily, LSA sophomore 
Marianna Dorta said the 
organization targets students 
who didn’t sign up to be organ 
donors when they received 
their driver’s licenses.

“It’s stressful, so 

we’re doing this today so 
more people can have the 
opportunity to sign up,” she 
said.

Dorta said it’s important 

to sign up students to register 
as organ and tissue donors to 
increase the chances of saving 
the life of someone who may 

need it most.

“The list of people who 

need organ transplants is so 
long,” she said. “I think it’s 
important for people to sign 
up because anyone can help. 
It’s just about putting yourself 
out there.”

LSA senior Meghan 

Rattanni and LSA junior 
Kelsey Almony tabled on 
behalf of Students for Choice’s 
menstruation station — a 
three-day informational booth 
aiming to educate the campus 
about stigmas associated with 
menstruation.

“We’re basically trying 

to end stigma around 
menstruation,” Rattanni said. 
“By promoting this positive 
thing where you can help 
somebody and also not feel 
ashamed about menstruating. 
That’s the main goal of this, to 
end the stigma around having 
a period.”

As part of awareness 

campaign, the organization 

also gave out women’s health 
materials, as well as raffled 
off prizes and displayed 
pamphlets on women’s health.

Almony added she 

thought that their outreach is 
beneficial for students who are 
uncomfortable with buying 
feminine products.

“It’s especially for people 

who might not feel comfortable 
or safe buying period staples at 
the store,” she said.

LSA freshman Daphne 

Blumin, a member of MARS, 
said the organization was 
tabling to spread awareness 
about veganism and animal 
rights on campus. She said 
the organization is currently

money for SASHA Farm, a 
farm animal sanctuary in 
Manchester, Mich.

Blumin said SASHA Farm 

houses runaway farm animals 
and takes care of them.

Accused shooter in 
Kalamazoo admits 
to killings

Uber driver Jason Dalton — 

who was accused of shooting 
and killing six random people 
— admitted to taking the lives of 
those individuals on Saturday, 
the Detroit Free Press reports.

Dalton allegedly shot and 

killed six people while taking 
Uber fares and injured two more 
across three different locations. 

He faces 16 charges including 

six counts of murder, two counts 
of assault with intent of murder 
and eight counts of felony 
firearm. 

Evidence against Dalton 

includes an eye-witness who 
picked him out of a photo line-up 
and video surveillance featuring 
Dalton.

Dalton was arrested Sunday, 

two hours after the shootings 
began when a Kalamazoo 
County sheriff’s deputy 
recognized a car matching the 
description of the shooter’s 
vehicle. Dalton was arrested 
peacefully, given a court-
appointed attorney and held 
without bail. 

Upon arrest, police seized a 

semi-automatic handgun Dalton 
had supposedly used in the 
killings.

Police investigation has yet to 

determine a motive for Dalton’s 
suspected shootings.

Heavy snow, 
wind expected to 
reach Michigan 
Wednesday

A winter storm moving up 

from Texas is expected to bring 
at about six inches or more 
of snow and greatly reduced 
visibility on the roads, according 
to the National Weather Service.

The details of the storm 

including its path and the 
amount of snow is still unclear. 
The bulk of the storm could 
be preceded by rain Tuesday 
night or Wednesday morning, 
but will likely turn to snow by 
Wednesday afternoon. 

Following the start of the 

snowfall, the storm is expected 
to continue until Thursday with 
winds of about 30 miles per hour 
reducing visibility to a quarter 
mile or less. 

“Blowing and drifting of snow 

will occur, ptentially leading to 
near white-out conditions,” the 
NWS said in a statement on its 
website.

Areas further north of Detroit 

could receive as much as 10 
inches of snow as the storm 
arrives. 

Snyder to release 
e-mails relating to 
Flint dating back 
to 2011

Gov. Rick Snyder’s 

administration will release 
e-mails dating back as far as 2011 
on topics relating to the Flint 
water crisis, the Detroit Free 
Press reports.

Snyder released his 

personal e-mails in January 
and the remainder of the 
executive branch — including 
the Michigan Departments 
of Environmental Quality, 
Treasury, Health and Human 
Services and Argriculture — 
released more than 20,000 pages 
of e-mails 10 days ago. 

The e-mails revealed that 

the bureaucracy downplayed 
and disregarded the complaints 
made by both residents and 
researchers regarding the 
quality and safety of the water. 

In his State of the State 

address in January, Snyder said 
he would release his own e-mails 
but initially opposed releasing 
those of the members of his 
executive cabinet. Under the 
state’s Freedom of Information 
law the executive branch and 
state legislature are exempt from 
public disclosure of documents.

Snyder’s stance changed last 

week when he stated a goal of 
increased transparency on all 
levels involving the crisis.

Silke-Maria Weineck, SACUA chair, discusses revamped course evaluation 
questions set for release in Fall 2016 in Palmer Commons on Monday.

“This 
will 
be 
rare,” 

Weineck said. ”Obviously, if 
every teacher opts out then 
it will make the data less 
meaningful.”

The committees also worked 

on modifying the questions 
asked on course evaluation 
surveys.

“These 
questions 
are 

much 
more 
targeted 
and 

the committee worked with 
quite a bit of research to see 

which questions seemed to be 
meaningful and worthwhile 
asking,” Weineck said.

Central

has 
been 

advocating for the release of 
course evaluations since 2011, 
when 
the

made 

a Freedom of Information

David Meyer 
awarded Henry 
Russel lectureship 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

David Meyer — this year’s Henry 

Russel lecturer as presented by 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel — dissected the 
process of thinking and discussed 
the importance of idea creation 
during his lecture at Rackham 
Amphitheatre on Monday.

Meyer, 
professor 
of 

mathematical 
psychology 
and 

cognitive science at the University, 
focused particularly on what makes 
an idea influential in society.

“One of our major missions is to 

have big ideas,” Meyer said.

Each year, a Henry Russel 

lecturer 
is 
chosen 
based 
on 

a 
person’s 
achievements 
in 

research, 
scholarship 
and/or 

creative endeavors, according to 
the Rackham website. Nominees 
are also supposed to display an 
outstanding record of teaching, 
mentoring and service to both 
the University and communities 
outside the University. The winner 
receives an award of $10,000. 

Meyer 
emphasized 
common 

questions in explaining ideas as 
a concept, such as what an idea 
actually is and how big ideas should 
be. In his lecture, titled “Toward 
the Biggest Idea of Them All: 50 
Years of Advances in Mathematical 
Psychology and Cognitive Science,” 
Meyer 
specifically 
emphasized 

“big ideas,” which he said lead to 
dramatic change in psychology 
fields. 

“Universities should be idea 

factories,” he said. 

Another key to understanding 

and generating ideas is practicing 
unique thinking, as each individual 
has a unique perspective on how 
to approach challenging subjects, 
Meyer said. He cited chemist 
Marie Curie as an example, who 
he said thought differently from 
astrophycisist 
Neil 
deGrasse 

Tyson, though both were able to 
make 
successful 
contributions 

in physics. Physical and mental 
diversity within a population is 
responsible for such a diverse range 
of successful ideas, he added.

“No one format is always best for 

representing various ideas,” Meyer 
noted. “Instead, the best format 
depends on the person and the 
context.”

Ideas come in many forms, 

Meyer said, and three factors — 
connectionism, computation and 
control — are key to big ideas. 
Ultimately, Meyer said combining 
the big ideas of connectionism, 
computation and control resolve 
the 
challenge 
of 
interrelating 

science and the humanities, called 
consilience.

Schlissel 
presented 
Meyer 

with the Henry Russel Award at 
Monday’s event.

Through models, theories and 

experiments, Schlissel emphasized 
that 
Meyer 
has 
enhanced 

knowledge in the fields of cognition 
and mathematical psychology.

“His work spans the boundaries 

of 
psychology, 
mathematics, 

linguistics and computer science,” 
Schlissel said.

Four 
faculty 
members 
also 

received the 2016 Henry Russel 
award and were honored at the 
event. Awardees include Julia Adler-
Milstein, assistant professor of 
Information, Clare Croft, assistant 
professor of Dance, Christopher 
Friese, 
assistant 
professor 
of 

Nursing 
and 
Jeremy 
Bassis, 

associate professor of atmospheric, 

oceanic and space sciences in the 
College of Engineering. The award 
is conferred to dinstinguished 
faculty who have demonstrated 
extraordinary accomplishments in 
their fields. 

Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 

presented these winners with 
their awards, highlighting their 
professional 
dedication 
and 

successes in research.

Following the lecture, LSA Dean 

Andrew Martin said among the 
things most important about it was 
celebrating the University’s faculty 
and their accomplishments.

“It’s also important to have talks 

like this that are really aspirational 
where our students can learn what 
our most distinguished faculty 
think are the horizons of knowledge 
going forward,” Martin said.

Martin said he was interested 

in many of the topics Meyer 
touched on throughout the lecture, 
particularly 
Meyer’s 
emphasis 

on 
the 
intersection 
between 

natural and social sciences and the 
humanities.

“(This) is something that many 

of us in LSA think about and need 
to continue thinking about going 
forward,” Martin said.

Neuroscience graduate student 

Sharena Rice said she is interested 
in many of the topics that Meyer 
planned on speaking about.

“I’m interested in computational 

neuroscience and this is extremely 
relevant,” Rice said. “It’s cognition 
and cognitive neuroscience and 
math and being able to put this 
all together and having things at 
this intersection is really great for 
expanding one’s mind in terms of 
thinking about the mind. I want 
to learn more about the methods 
behind this and what kinds of 
things have arose over the last 50 
years. Sometimes the history isn’t 
discussed in class.”

Front 
and 
the 
American 

Civil Liberties Union over 
alleged racial profiling in the 
city’s police force, ultimately 
leading to a series of reforms. 
Rev. Damon Lynch III, a key 
community leader in filing the 
lawsuit who was a panelist at 
the event, said there was a 
clear need for change at the 
time.

“Some 
of 
(the 
killings) 

were justified, some of them 
were not, in our eyes,” Lynch 
said. 
“But 
at 
that 
point 

everybody dying was Black, 
every officer that killed them 
was white. And we felt there 
was a problem in the city of 
Cincinnati.”

Panelists cited the case of 

Timothy Thomas, an unarmed 
Black man shot and killed by 
a Cincinnati police officer, in 
explaining the situations that 
led to the lawsuit. Thomas 
was the 15th Black man killed 
by Cincinnati police since 1995 
according to the New York 
Times, and shortly after his 
death riots ensued throughout 
the city. These riots were 
prompted by a number of 
factors, including statements 
from the police officer in 
question who charged that 
Thomas was “reaching” for 
the officer’s waist at the time 
of the shooting.

“But of course there were 

these 
five 
famous 
words 

that every officer will use 
when they take a person’s 
life: ‘I feared for my life,’ ” 
Lynch said. “When Timothy 
Thomas was killed, Cincinnati 
divided.”

In 
particular, 
audience 

members 
and 
speakers 

discussed 
a 
collaborative 

agreement between the police 
and various stakeholders — 
the result of the lawsuit — 
enacted in 2002.

The 
Collaborative 

Agreement 
calls 
for 
the 

initiation 
of 
a 
proactive 

problem-solving method for 
police officers rather than 
letting incidents play out to 
ultimately make an arrest.

Thacher said the model is 

an effective, new approach 
that fundamentally changes 
the system, adding that the 
brutal use of authority is a 
problem that must be avoided 
all across the country.

University 
of 
Cincinnati 

Prof. 
John 
Eck, 
another 

panelist, 
served 
as 
an 

academic consultant for the 
reforms team and was a part of 
the negotiation processes. He 
said he noticed many citizens 
oscillating between wanting 
fair policing and effective 
policing, and realized the 
Collaborative Agreement had 
to break this cycle and resolve 
underlying conditions.

“The one strategy of policing 

I was aware of, since I worked 
on it for 17 years, was problem-
oriented policing,” Eck said.

Eck 
said 
the 
“problem 

oriented” policing approach 
addressed the kinds of things 
for which police were getting 

in trouble in Cincinnati, like 
unnecessary shootings.

From the police perspective, 

panelist James Whalen, former 
Cincinnati assistant chief and 
public safety director, said 
community involvement was 
not welcomed by the police 
department at first. Whalen 
was a part of the team that 
adopted 
the 
change 
and 

helped decrease the number 
of misdemeanors by working 
with the community.

“We would listen to what 

folks had to say and then when 
they walked away we would 
decide what we thought the 
best way was to go,” Whalen 
said. “I think we didn’t have a 
sense of the whole.”

James 
White, 
assistant 

chief of the Detroit Police 
Department, also joined the 
panel to reflect on ways local 
communities may be able 
to learn from Cincinnati’s 
example. 
He 
said 
that 

engaging with the community 
is the best way to make reform, 
and that the old policies 
should be changed in order to 
more appropriately teach new 
police.

“You have to be progressive 

in 
policing,” 
White 
said. 

“There is no one-size-fit-all 
type approach to policing.”

White 
added 
that 
race 

must also be addressed when 
talking about policing.

“When 
we 
refuse 
to 

acknowledge the fact that 
policing in urban America is 
different, I think we miss an 
opportunity for a discussion,” 
White said.

After the event, Public 

Policy 
graduate 
student 

Sabiha Zainulbhai said she had 
knowledge of the Department 
of Justice working with cities 
like New York, but wasn’t 
sure what exactly happened 
in Cincinnati until she took a 
course with Thacher. 

“I took a class at the Ford 

School called Thinking About 
Crime with David Thacher,” 
Zainulbhai said. “We talked 
about Cincinnati a little bit. I 
didn’t really know much about 
what went on there when, so 
this was kind of like a more 
comprehensive 
picture 
of 

what it looks like when the 
DOJ comes in and then like 
what happens after that.”

Lynch noted that many 

cities across America, such 
as Ferguson, Cleveland and 
Chicago, are seeking ways to 
reform policing to deter the 
use of deadly force by their 
police officers.

In 2014, Ann Arbor resident 

Aura Rosser, a Black woman, 
was shot by a police officer 
in her home. Since her death, 
a group called Ann Arbor to 
Ferguson has regularly held 
protests and rallies calling for 
reform and action to prevent 
police brutality in Ann Arbor 
and beyond.

Lynch 
said 
cities 
must 

constantly keep addressing 
those 
issues 
in 
order 
to 

effectively 
focus 
on 
a 

successful future.

“Somebody has to climb the 

flagpole to make this country a 
better place,” Lynch said.

Shortly after the city of Flint’s 

switch to the use of Flint River 
water in April 2014, residents raised 
concerns about rashes and hair loss. 
In January 2015, protesters called 
for higher-quality water. By March 
2015, even the city council voted 7–1 
to end the use of Flint River water, 
but because of a Michigan law that 
stripped local leaders of their power, 
all of these factions were excluded 
from the decision-making process.

A month ago, Gov. Rick Snyder 

released e-mails from 2014 and 2015 
related to the Flint water crisis. In 
many of these, members of Snyder’s 
administration dismiss and belittle 
the concerns of poisoned residents. 
Snyder’s former chief of staff, 
Dennis Muchmore, accuses affected 
residents of turning the situation 
into a “political football” and calls 
groups asking for investigations 
“anti-everything.” Another Snyder 
staffer refers to “data” in quotes 
to undermine the credibility of 
information provided by a local 
physician indicating high levels of 
lead in Flint water.

In his State of the State address 

and recent interviews, Snyder has 
tried to deflect blame by pointing 
to the Flint City Council’s 2013 vote 
in favor of a new water system. Yet 
shortly after December 2012, the 
governor 
signed 
an 
emergency 

manager 
law 
that 
allows 
the 

state to intervene in financially 
struggling municipalities — an idea 
that Michigan voters rejected just 
months before. Under that law, the 
state’s treasury held the power to 
make the water switch. Indeed, 
Snyder’s hand-picked emergency 
manager called the council’s vote 

to end the use of Flint River water 
“incomprehensible” and chose to 
ignore it.

Snyder’s 
administration 
has 

created a system in which public 
leaders are neither responsive to nor 
reflective of their constituents, and 
this inevitably leads to outcomes 
that do not benefit the community. 
In this case, the result is a tragedy: 
A generation of children will never 
have the opportunity to reach their 
full potential as a result of lead 
poisoning.

One of the released e-mails, in 

which a staffer writes to Snyder 
about a Flint taxation debate, 
shows just how removed Michigan 
residents can be from the decisions 
that greatly impact their lives:

“Governor, as you know Flint 

would like to increase its city income 
tax from 1.0% to 1.5% … Farrington, 
Chair of House Taxation — said he 
would take up this bill over his dead 
body. Then he said he would take up 
if you asked directly. You are having 
lunch with him today — can you just 
mention the importance of getting 
this bill done before we adjourn.”

Flint, 
an 
urban 
center 

predominantly 
made 
up 
of 

residents of color, had its taxing 
power decided over lunch by the 
governor and Jeff Farrington, a 
representative from a suburban 
district that is 87-percent white and 
nearly an hour away. And this was 
business as usual.

Coming from Michigan’s middle-

class suburbs, I know it can be easy to 
distance oneself from these political 
problems until something like the 
Flint crisis makes the news. In my 
small hometown, Wixom, and in the 
vast majority of Michigan cities and 
towns, there is no fear of political 
leaders taking away our way of life. 
But democracy is not an exclusive 
right of upper- and middle-class 
white suburban communities. And 
as Michiganders, we must realize 
that situations like Flint will happen 
again if we do nothing.

It matters who writes the rules, 

and empowering Flint residents 
could have shortened or prevented 
the crisis. Participatory rulemaking 
at the city level, for example, would 
have ensured residents had a say in 
their water regulations. Some form 
of participatory budgeting process 
would 
have 
allowed 
residents 

to make their own cost-saving 
tradeoffs. 
Our 
democracy 
only 

works if all the voices in our state 
have an opportunity to take part 
in writing the rules of governance. 
When we fail to create opportunities 
for inclusive decision-making — or 
even basic democratic access — 
there is little to protect our state’s 
most vulnerable residents from 
catastrophes like this one.

Enforce copyrights, protect music
A

s Taylor Swift has so famously 
asserted, “Music is art, and art is 
important 
and 
rare. 
Important, 

rare things are valuable. 
Valuable things should 
be paid for.” That may be 
true, but unfortunately 
for Swift — and the music 
industry as a whole — 
the right to determine 
the 
commercial 
value 

of music no longer rests 
with creators, labels or 
publishers.

It rests with the anony-

mous pirates of the World 
Wide Web.

Though endemic for 

decades, music piracy exploded when digital 
and web-based technology rendered illegal 
music replication and dissemination cost-
free, leaving the legal ramifications of copy-
right infringement the last remaining barrier 
to large-scale piracy. But, save for a cluster of 
lawsuits initiated by the Recording Industry 
Association of America, music pirates have 
faced few legal challenges to their thievery. 
Absent more rigorous enforcement of copy-
right laws, the music industry has little hope 
of recovering the profits lost from a decade 
replete with intellectual property theft.

Absent uniform, large-scale copyright 

enforcement, consumers can get pirated 
songs for free on file-sharing sites, often 
rendering them unwilling to pay for physi-
cal or digital copies of CDs in the future. 
This dealt a catastrophic blow to the music 
industry, which operated on a sales-driven 
business model. As industry profits plum-
meted from $45 billion in the early 2000s 
to roughly $7 billion today, entrepreneurs 
scrambled to develop distribution models 
that might entice listeners to actually pay 
for the music they consume.

These efforts produced Spotify and other 

streaming services, which allow listeners to 
play music on demand for free in exchange 
for listening to brief advertisements. Spo-
tify has provided an accessible, no-cost way 
for 60 million consumers in 58 countries to 
legally listen to music, while still compen-
sating songwriters and recording artists for 
their work. By providing its services to con-
sumers for the price set by music pirates — 
absolutely free — Spotify has played a role in 
the industry’s anti-piracy fight. Upon initial 
introduction in Sweden, the service reduced 
music piracy by 80 percent. 

But the streaming model returns notori-

ously low profits to artists, who rely on pub-
lishers, labels and performing rights societies 
to quickly and accurately pay out royalties 
on billions of individual song plays valued at 
fractions of a penny each. High-profile art-
ists like Swift have pulled their catalogue 
from the service in protest, despite the risk 
that doing so might drive consumers back to 
piracy sites.

Even if artists had vigorously supported 

the service, Spotify could not have solved the 
piracy problem. Allowing users to listen to 
music free of charge merely enables the ser-
vice to compete with — but not defeat — the 
pirates. Today, more than 20 million Ameri-
cans still consume pirated music, and it will 
take much more than a creative distribution 
model to reduce this number.

This is not a surprise. Intellectual prop-

erty laws exist precisely because ideas like 
song lyrics and composition are infinitely 
replicable once they become public. Until 
the government enforces copyrights more 
effectively, pirates will continue to replicate 
and disseminate music unabated. Just as the 
government has a responsibility for enforcing 
traditional property rights through policing 
and standard deterrence, it too should direct 
resources to defending the rights it has guar-
anteed intellectual property owners.

Currently, copyright enforcement relies 

on entities like the RIAA to sue individual 
infringers. But in a digital era where pirates 
are often anonymous and host sites across 
international borders are outside of U.S. 
jurisdiction, relying on lawsuits is wholly 
inadequate. At the very least, it can only tack-
le the problem hosted in the United States, 
leaving cross-border theft unenforced in the 
vast majority of cases.

Music pirates exploit technology to carry 

out their crimes, and government agencies 
tasked with copyright enforcement should 
employ digital resources to detect and pre-
vent infringement. The music industry itself 
has invested substantial capital to develop 
watermarking and fingerprinting technolo-
gies, both of which are designed to detect 
piracy by tracking where songs appear 
online. The technologies aren’t perfect. 
But the government — staffed with trained 
computer scientists — could conceivably 
improve these technologies and employ 
them to defend the rights that it has guaran-
teed to music creators.

Digital watermark and fingerprint codes 

could be synced with the metadata already on 
file for works registered with the U.S. Copy-
right Office, allowing enforcement teams to 
match pirated copies of works with copyright 
holders, empowering rights owners to pursue 
damages in civil court. Additionally, armed 
with more information about the nature and 
scale of piracy activities hosted by individual 
sites, the government could itself prosecute 
the pirates, or in the case of foreign-hosted 
websites, provide data to similar agencies in 
foreign states.

Granting federal bureaucracy the legal 

purview to police the Internet is not neces-
sarily an attractive option. But after a decade 
of failed market solutions and piecemeal 
enforcement through the occasional private 
lawsuit, it’s certainly time to try something 
new. Empowering the government to enforce 
the laws it created is a good place to start.

Distracted living with the RE-vibe

I

t’s a Thursday afternoon and I’m 
five minutes into reading about 
Marco Rubio’s tax policies. 

In 
reality, 
I 

should be paying 
attention to my

who 

is discussing the 
different 
types 

of volcanoes on 
Earth. 
Given 

that his class is

that I am taking

little motivation 
to pay attention.

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, 

the small plastic box velcroed to 
my left wrist vibrates, reminding 
me to redirect my focus toward my 
professor.

That small, plastic, watch-esque 

device is called the RE-vibe, and it 
was created by FokusLabs, a small 
tech company based in North Caro-
lina. Rich Brancaccio, the founder of 
FokusLabs and a school psychologist 
specializing in ADHD and autism, 
created the device to help young 
children stay focused in school.

“The RE-vibe is essentially a 

virtual tap on the shoulder,” Bran-
caccio explained to me. “When it 
vibrates, it poses the question, ‘Am 
I doing what I’m supposed to be 
doing?’ If you answer ‘yes,’ use that 
as positive reinforcement. If you 
answer ‘no,’ use that as a reminder 
to get on task.”

This mechanism is decidedly 

simple; there is no screen on the 
RE-vibe and you can’t actually do 
anything with the device. As Bran-
caccio explained to me, this was 
intentional.

“We originally planned on put-

ting our algorithms on smart-
watches, but we found that the 
smartwatches 
themselves 
were 

distracting. People will get a text or 

a Twitter notification and go, ‘Oh, 
I should check that out.’ The very 
thing that is supposed to keep you 
from being distracted is the thing 
that distracts you.” 

While the device was originally 

created for young kids, the mod-
ern college student is the key test 
subject in analyzing the RE-vibe’s 
functionality.

Tasked with maintaining stel-

lar grades, active social lives and 
general social productivity, college 
students are forcing their brains to 
multitask beyond physical capabili-
ties more than ever before.

Such a society has seen a rise in 

students turning to medication like 
Adderall for help focusing, despite 
not having prescriptions. In our 
world context, singular focus is 
not an option; multitasking is the 
desired result that is worth risking 
even one’s life over.

This ideology exists in stark 

contrast to the RE-vibe. When dis-
cussing the simplistic nature of the 
first-edition RE-vibe, Brancaccio 
stated, “I think it’s important to 
pick one thing and do it really well.” 
Though he was speaking about the 
design of his company’s first prod-
uct, his message permeates through 
the device’s guiding ideology: Stop 
messing around and focus on the 
task at hand.

For the past month, I have been 

trying to focus on the task at hand 
with the help of the RE-vibe. In 
many cases — like my mini-course 
— I have found the device extreme-
ly helpful. When I found myself 
wandering off, the RE-vibe would 
often buzz me back into focus. 
While reading a long, dull text-
book chapter, my wrist-worn “tap 
on the shoulder” made sure I didn’t 
fall asleep or check my Twitter. In 
these instances, I felt empowered 
to maintain focus for extended 
periods of time.

However, the buzzes didn’t just 

occur when I was distracted. Due 
to a lack of sensor technology, the 
RE-vibe can only approximate 
when it thinks the wearer might 
be distracted. What this meant 
for me was a lot of buzzes while I 
was walking to class, taking exams 
and focusing intently on my task at 
hand. Over time, these meaningless 
buzzes encouraged me to ignore the 
device in situations where buzzes 
might actually help me.

Brancaccio said future versions 

of the RE-vibe hope to tackle this 
issue; his team already has an algo-
rithm that can sense when some-
body is truly distracted.

The real problem — the one 

without an answer in the pipeline 
— lies in determining when people 
are focused. In their current state, 
motion sensors, heart rate moni-
tors and related sensors aren’t 
advanced enough to detect such 
nuanced context.

Despite false vibrations, I found 

myself appreciative of the instanc-
es in which the reminder served a 
purpose for my brain. However, for 
college students, I don’t know that 
the RE-vibe, in its current state, is 
the perfect answer I wanted it to 
be. With future iterations — which 
Brancaccio promised me are well in 
the works — that could all change. 
Maybe a smarter, more context-
aware RE-vibe could keep college 
students from using Adderall as a 
non-prescription focus drug.

Or maybe a future version will 

just keep me from checking the tax 
policies of Bernie Sanders later on 
in my mini-course. My wrist hasn’t 
vibrated in five minutes and I’m 
already on the fourth page of pro-
posed policies.

Owens biopic ‘Race’ 
runs slow and steady

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

The goal of historical dramas 

and biopics is often to enhance our 
understanding of past events and 
to shine a light 
on 
moments 

that may have 
dimmed 
over 

time. 
These 

films can help 
reshape 
our 

understand-
ing of current 
events we face, 
adding depth to 
today’s problems by demonstrat-
ing their echoes throughout his-
tory. “Race” is the latest of these 
biopics.

“Race” tells the story of Olym-

pic runner Jesse Owens (Stephan 
James, “Selma”) and how he won 
four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin 
games, held in the middle of Nazi 
Germany. After coming to Ohio 
State University as one of the first 
black athletes and facing bigotry 
from other players and coaches, 
Owens’s qualification for the Ber-
lin Olympics only augments his 
struggle to succeed when the 
NAACP calls on him to withdraw 
from the games in solidarity with 
the Jewish people. Attending the 
games with the hope that defeat-
ing Germany will send a greater 
message, the film explores the poli-
tics behind the involvement of the 
U.S. in the Olympics and the way 

Owens’s race plays into decisions 
at levels as large as international 
relations and as small as congratu-
latory remarks after a race.

The film addresses race from 

a vast array of angles, living up to 
its name and depicting the multi-
faceted complications that come 
from tackling such a pervasive and 
complex subject. From the first 
time Owens boards the bus to Ohio 
State for his first semester, we see 
snide comments from the white 
women sitting in the front, and 
these microaggressions escalate to 
confrontations in the locker room 
or interactions with other teams’ 
coaches. Establishing the per-
vasiveness of racial inequality in 
Owens’s everyday life sets the floor 
of the film well. When we do move 
onto larger issues, such as his deci-
sion whether or not to compete in 
the games, or the prejudices of the 
German Olympic committee, these 
are not the only times his race is a 
point of contention. Additionally, 
the film ends on a note of contin-
ued bigotry in the United States, 
with a scene of Owens and his wife 
arriving at a dinner at the Astoria 
held in his honor and being forced 
to use the service entrance behind 
the hotel. The image of the two 
walking through a bustling, dirty 
kitchen in elegant evening wear is 
shocking and honest, ending the 
film on a sober note.

There’s a huge amount of 

screen time devoted to interac-
tions 
between 
the 
American 

Olympic Committee and Joseph 
Goebbels, Nazi Germany’s director 
of propaganda (Barnaby Metsch-
urat, “L’auberge espagnole”), as 
the two angrily argue over Ger-
many’s treatment of the American 
athletes, both Black and Jewish. 
What’s interesting about these 
moments, though, is not just the 
way these athletes’ ability to com-
pete in the Olympics is based on 
white officials’ opinions about race, 
but the way the officials’ power 
and brutality seem to go hand in 
hand. Leni Riefenstahl (Carice 
van Houten, “Game of Thrones”) 
is problematically seen as more of 
a heroic, anti-establishment artist, 
instead of Hitler’s close friend and 
Nazi supporter.

The instances of camaraderie 

between athletes on the Olympic 
team, regardless of race or coun-
try, is a powerful inclusion to the 
story, and one of the most striking 
moments of the film comes from 
the on-field friendship between 
Owens and fellow German com-
petitor Lutz Long (David Kross, 
“War Horse”). Once Long fouls 
and disqualifies himself from the 
long jump, he invites Owens to fin-
ish the competition, the two then 
taking a victory lap together in cel-
ebration of the new world record. 
Looked down upon scornfully by 
the Nazi officials at the top of the 
stadium, there is a sense of prog-
ress and unity on the field, and a 
glimmer of hope in the drab land-
scape of the time.

KANYE WEEK
Breaking: Kanye is 
an asshole, still OK

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

Kanye West is an asshole: an 

incredibly talented, multifacet-
ed, boundary-pushing asshole. 
But despite the feelings you 
may have about him as a per-
son, to deny his societal clout 
and musical prowess is naïve. 
His ability to maintain an enor-
mous global fan base despite 
his aggressive persona and 
lyrical styles is both impres-
sive and puzzling. He shames 
women and other social groups, 
but wraps it in such impres-
sive packaging that it is hard to 
resist. Listeners are in love with 
the madness — the suspense of 
not knowing what the icon will 
do next. West’s views are often 
problematic 
and 
offensive, 

leaving it up to the listeners to 
decide if the power of his music 
is enough to outweigh his, at 
times, unsavory personality. As 
a young woman, I have a hard 
time justifying my support of 
the artist in his often sexist and 
unkind artistry.

Take West’s “Cold,” feat. DJ 

Khaled, as just one example of 
’Ye’s paradoxically brilliant and 
distasteful nature. In just the 
first verse of this track alone, 
West disses PETA, brings up 

monetary inequalities between 
races in America and reminds 
listeners that he can snag a “bad 
bitch without no flaws.” The 
song goes on to name drop Anna 
Wintour, model Anja Rubik, 
Jay-Z and Wiz Khalifa. West 
wants you to know that famous 
people respect him too, not just 
public peasants.

It wouldn’t be a true Yeezy 

track unless the rapper called 
someone out in a not-so-sub-
tle fashion. As the track was 
released in 2012, it comes as no 
surprise that West’s scorching 
gaze fell upon Kris Humphries. 
It was around this time that 
’Ye’s future fiancé was involved 
with Mr. Humphries, prompt-
ing ’Ye to vent his jealousy in 
the most appropriate way pos-
sible — an aggressive verse 
threatening to get Humphries 
dropped from his team.

“Cold” is arresting, surpris-

ing and not for everyone, just 
like the artist who wrote it. Its 
soundscape is abrasive, with 
repetitive beeping tones, yells 
and coughs from West and 
Khaled. Lines like “Don’t talk 
about style cause I embarrass 
you / Shut the fuck up when 
you talk to me ‘fore I embar-
rass you” are not for the weak of 
heart, but neither is West. The 

song hints at the artist’s ever 
rising dreams for himself, like 
being the creative director of 
Hermes, and his never-falter-
ing self-confidence. His belief 
in himself is both enviable and 
overbearing. It proves that 
Kanye really does love Kanye 
more than anyone else. (Sorry, 
Kim.)

West is a prime example of 

the relationship between an 
artist, their work and public 
opinion. Is it the public’s job to 
differentiate between an art-
ist and their work, then judge 
each accordingly? Or are art-
ists to be taken as a whole? 
These questions become even 
more 
convoluted 
when 
the 

artist in question is guilty of 
transgressions that are deemed 
essentially harmless — making 
sexist comments or being elit-
ist, rather than committing a 
hard crime. I think that these 
kinds of questions can only 
be answered on an individual 
level. West is undeniably iconic 
and deserves to be honored for 
the art he has produced and 
inspired. I think that Yeezus is 
a masterpiece and that West is 
nothing if not driven. But, he’s 
also a jerk. And I am still unsure 
how exactly to think of him, and 
am doubtful that I ever will.

TV REVIEW
‘11.22.63’ struggles 
to engage its viewers

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

On November 22, 1963, Presi-

dent John F. Kennedy was assassi-
nated when his motorcade passed 
through Dealey 
Plaza during a 
visit to Dallas, 
TX. Shots heard 
originating 
from the Texas 
Book 
Deposi-

tory led to the 
arrest of Lee 
Harvey Oswald 
for the murder 
of the president. When Oswald 
himself was assassinated before 
we could hear his account of what 
happened on 11/22/1963, the fuel 
that would light the flame of con-
spiracy theorists began its slow 
burn.

“11.22.63” is a Hulu miniseries 

adapted from the Stephen King 
novel of the same name. The prem-
ise explores the complex idea of 
time travel and the implications 
that might arise if people mess 
with time. It’s a butterfly effect that 
basically boils down to “If you fuck 
with the past, it’ll fuck with you.” 
Specifically, the series presents the 
idea of altering a fixed point in time 
— the JFK assassination. Show-
runner Bridget Carpenter (“Friday 
Night Lights”) and producer J.J. 
Abrams (“Star Wars: The Force 
Awakens”) head the adaptation of 
the novel into an 8-part series.

“11.22.63” may work well as a 

novel, but it ultimately falls short of 
expectations as a television series. 
If anything, the adaptation serves 
as a dramatic period piece with a 
savvy science fiction hook. Playing 
off of concepts that stemmed from 
successful predecessors such as 
“The Twilight Zone” and “Back to 

the Future,” the series tries to uti-
lize the goodwill associated with 
depicting American history. And 
while the target audience is most 
likely aimed at the baby boomer 
and millennial generations, the 
time commitment of the first 
hour-and-20-minute episode is 
unrealistic. Although it isn’t much 
longer than an episode of “Game of 
Thrones,” the show lacks “GoT” ’s 
emotional payoff when the episode 
is finished. With “11.22.63,” you’re 
left feeling emotionless and with-
out a desire to continue to the next 
episode. Frankly, it is an easy show 
to forget.

Diner owner and apparent time 

traveler Al (Chris Cooper, “The 
Muppets”) believes that if the 
assassination of JFK is averted, 
then events that led to advance-
ments in Vietnam by JFK’s succes-
sor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, 
and the assassination of Robert 
Kennedy would never have hap-
pened. It’s an interesting idea, but 
as he’s a Vietnam veteran himself, 
the question arises of whether Al’s 
motives are self-serving and lim-
ited to his own motivations. How-
ever, when Al is diagnosed with 
cancer, he entrusts the secret of 
time travel to friend Jake Epping 
(James Franco, “The Interview”), 
an adult educator and recently 
divorced deadbeat, in the hopes 
that he will travel back to the past 
and carry on Al’s mission. The 
delivery in the present day seg-
ment of the premiere is a sloppy 
portrayal of the ordinary meeting 
the extraordinary. While Franco 
is unconvincing as a small-time 
man who has given up trying in 
life, Cooper’s Al is reminiscent of 
Eastwood’s “Gran Torino” perfor-
mance, but trading in conviction 
for wide-eyed madness.

The portal in time, aptly dubbed 

the “rabbit hole,” is located in the 
diner closet, and is where Stephen 
King’s influence melts smoothly 
into that of J.J. Abrams. An end-
less black Hitchcockian hallway 
engulfs Jake for a few slow seconds 
before we are transported to the 
glittering brightness of the ’60s, 
sans the trademark lens flares. As 
soon as Jake Epping steps through 
the portal, so does Franco, who 
shines in his fish-out-of water per-
formance, caught in the ambiance 
of the 1960s. As Franco becomes 
more comfortable with his sur-
roundings, we feel that he is more 
sure of himself in his performance. 
However, as is the case with any 
Stephen King adaptation, sus-
penseful music and horror scenes 
lie just around the corner of each 
commercial break.

A supernatural edge slices into 

the past at unexpected moments, 
eliciting a “scare jump” from the 
audience. Later, Jake edges clos-
er to George de Mohrenschildt 
(Jonny Coyne, “Nightcrawler”), a 
friend of Oswald that Al suspected 
was in touch with the CIA and ulti-
mately persuaded Oswald to assas-
sinate Kennedy. After following 
Mohrenschildt to the restaurant 
El Conejo, Jake is almost set on fire 
and crushed to death by a falling 
chandelier as history pushes back 
against his actions; a telephone 
booth is run down and strangers 
warn Jake of his unwanted pres-
ence in the past. Tragedies liter-
ally fall out of the sky in “11.22.63,” 
and we’re never sure what the 
outcome of the domino effect will 
play out for the cast. The trailers 
show much promise from King’s 
side, so hopefully we’ll get to see 
his influence later on as the mini-
series picks up pace in accelerating 
towards its ultimate end game — 
November 22, 1963.

‘Broad City’ back 
and wild as ever

Third season 

premiere is another 
wacky adventure in 

New York City

By MARIA ROBINS-SOMER-

VILLE

Daily Arts Writer

They talked openly about 

pooping and wore the same 
outfits more than once. They 
worked thank-
less jobs just 
to make ends 
meet. 
They 

were 
sweaty, 

hungry 
and 

stoned a lot of 
the time — self-
titled 
“Jew-

esses 
tryna 

make a buck.” 
At “Broad City” 
’s inception in 
2014, Ilana Wexler (Ilana Glaz-
er, “The Night Before”) and 
Abbi Abrams (Abbi Jacobson, 
“Inside Amy Schumer”) were 
unlike the majority of female 
television protagonists. They 
played on New York as if it were 
an adult playground.

“Broad City” ’s third season 

premiere “Two Chainz” lives 
up to this unvarnished and 
wacky depiction of the duo’s 
mishaps as hedonistic and self-
proclaimed queens. The show is 
often compared to “Girls” due 
to its focus on twenty-some-
thing women in New York, but 
a much more accurate com-
parison would be “Curb Your 
Enthusiasm” 
or 
“Seinfeld,” 

which feature irreverent humor 
through 
meditation 
on 
the 

mundane.

The episode opens with a 

split frame. We see Abbi and 
Ilana in their respective bath-
rooms, engaging in a wide range 
of activities on their porcelain 
thrones. They get high, have 
sex and eat chocolate. Set to 
Lizzo and Caroline Smith’s “Let 
‘Em Say,” the show’s opening 
scene announces that “Broad 
City” is back and irreverent as 
ever. Here are two besties who 
are confident in their fabulous-
ness and unabashed about their 
slacker-stoner lifestyles.

The next scene encapsulates 

what often holds “Broad City” ’s 
comedic essence together — the 
amplification of the trivial, jux-
taposed casually with the seri-
ous. While in pursuit of brunch, 
Ilana talks about the plight 
of oppressed Saudi Arabian 
women in the same breath as 
her masturbation habits. Ilana 
frequently tries to express well-
meaning but often misguided 
expression of cultural political 
awareness; she expresses her 
discontent about the turmoil to 
Abbi but almost cries when the 
waiter tells her the brunch deal 
no longer includes bottomless 
mimosas. True tragedy.

The sweetness of “Broad 

City” ’s humor stems from the 
deeply affirming and unshake-
able love between the best 
friends. When Abbi demon-
strates insecurity and unease, 
Ilana lifts her up. In a moment 
of doubt about her fashion 
quotient, Ilana reassures her 
that she looks “sexy and viva-

cious, like young wife material, 
but taut and teasy still.” When 
Abbi responds to a sleazy man 
calling out “Nice ass!” with 
a “Yeah, I know,” we know 
Ilana’s 
constant 
affirmation 

has likely helped cook up the 
quippy retort.

Even 
Lincoln 
(Hannibal 

Buress, “Neighbors”), Ilana’s 
loveable friend with benefits, 
aids in the show’s subverting 
of traditional gender roles. He 
expresses sensitivity through 
funny banter about “Sex and 
the City,” and by proudly call-
ing his mother after his gradua-
tion from trapeze school.

Another feature of the show’s 

comedy is exaggerated interac-
tion with features of the urban 
landscape. 
Abbi 
gets 
stuck 

inside of a porta potty. A ware-
house sale becomes a literal bat-
tleground. The women engage 
in spitfire shade-throwing with 
a pretentious brunch host. Ilana 
and Abbi nonchalantly find 
themselves at an overtly phal-
lic art show. They travel by foot, 
bike and truck with a fluidity 
that is distinctly urban in a way 
that lends itself to the show’s 
surreal humor. The physical 
movement is key, keeping ener-
gy high and punch lines quick.

Abbi and Ilana have contin-

ued to reclaim the word “broad” 
in multiple senses. “Broad,” 
typically used as old-fashioned 
slang for women, now cel-
ebrates the flawed, spontane-
ous and fluid nature of being a 
woman. The humor is “broad,” 
too; it provides an inclusive, 
open landscape for more superb 
comedy to come.

I

t was a snowy day in Janu-
ary, and my roommate 
Sophia and I were walking 

home. As usual, our conversa-
tion had turned to books, but 
this time 
we talked 
specifically 
about those 
of our child-
hood. Sophia 
offhandedly 
asked me if I 
would let my 
hypotheti-
cal children 
read these 
same works. 
When I 
joked that I would incinerate 
garbage like “The Clique” or 
“Gossip Girl” before letting it 
into my future home, Sophia 
asked what I would encourage 
my children to read. Without 
hesitation, I said that if I had a 
daughter I would sequentially 
give her all of Phyllis Reynolds 
Naylor’s “Alice” books when 
she started third grade.

There’s a moment in the film 

“The Royal Tenenbaums” when 
a voiceover from narrator Alec 
Baldwin responds to a state-
ment made by the patriarch 
of the family, quietly disclos-
ing that “Immediately after 
making this statement, Royal 
realized that it was true.” The 
exact same line boomed in my 
head after I mentioned “Alice.” 
It’s comforting to think that 
the series critical to my adoles-
cence is always on the tip of my 
tongue and a bit disconcerting 
that Alec Baldwin’s voice lurks 
in the corners of my minds.

The “Alice” series started 

in 1985 with “The Agony of 
Alice.” Alice McKinley is an 
awkward, motherless sixth 
grader being raised by her 
father and her brother, Lester. 
Lacking a maternal figure, 
Alice feels doubly clueless 
heading into adolescence and 
attempts to find a mother in 
teachers, aunts and Lester’s 
teenage girlfriends with their 

extensive knowledge of perms. 
Naylor follows Alice through 
28 books — we see her teenage 
years to her adulthood in the 
last book. Naylor has described 
Alice as the daughter she never 
had, crafting her with love and 
reality.

I read the first book when 

I was in fourth grade. In the 
start of the year, the girl sitting 
across from me — my future 
best friend, Elizabeth — saw 
me reading it. I had just taken 
“The Agony of Alice” out of my 
desk when she leaned across 
the table. Elizabeth has always 
been one to play it cool, but 
this was way too important to 
be nonchalant. “Did you know 
that Phyllis Reynolds Naylor 
lives in our neighborhood?” 
I did not. But it made me feel 
even closer to Alice. Alice, who 
loved words and who got her-
self into awkward situations by 
thinking without speaking just 
like I did, was conceived two 
blocks away from where I was 
growing up.

The proximity of the author 

amplified my intense obses-
sion with the books, but the 
origin of my infatuation with 
Alice was the message, because 
it was different from the sim-
plistic didactic prose of other 
young adult I was reading, 
where themes of “being your-
self” littered every page. But 
Alice doesn’t conform to that 
confining argument, instead 
embracing that change and 
uncertainty are necessary 
for growth. In “My So Called 
Life,” another inspirational 
and important form of teen 
media, the protagonist Angela 
proclaims with angst “People 
always say how you should 
be yourself, like yourself is a 
definitive thing, like a toaster 
or something.” This was a 
problem I encountered as a 
teenager and continue to expe-
rience — is there inauthenticity 
in perpetual change? “Alice” 
helped me mitigate this shame 
of not immediately knowing 
who we are and who we could 
be. My friends and I were 
never not going to be simulacra 
and Naylor knew that — but it 
felt like she loved us anyways. 
We could be whoever we want-
ed for as long as we wanted, 
and that was beautiful.

What truly made the “Alice” 

series different from other 
young adult books like “The 
Song of the Lioness” series or 
“The Babysitter’s Club” was its 
unabashed treatment of sex. 
I have the clearest memory of 
being 10 and reading one of the 
“Alice” books on a car trip with 
my family. Through Naylor’s 
rather graphic descriptions, 
I learned what oral sex was, 
and asked my mother if it was 
true because I genuinely could 
not believe it. After affirming 
that this aspect of sexuality 
was not a joke, she craned her 
head from the front seat with a 
perplexed look. “What? Rebec-
ca, what are you reading?” 
Through the awkward sexual 
misadventures of Alice and her 
friend, Naylor, a self-described 

“enlightened grandmother,” 
the series strives to demystify 
sex and the taboos surround-
ing it. The expression of sexual 
development in “Alice” doesn’t 
follow a typical mold, espe-
cially in its focus on female 
pleasure and masturbation. 
Alice’s undaunted discussion 
of masturbation leads to more 
pleasurable sexual relations 
later in her life. In “Intensely 
Alice,” Alice and her boyfriend 
Patrick mutually masturbate on 
a park bench where she “guided 
his fingers just where I wanted 
them, showing him how hard to 
press and how fast to do it, and 
a few minutes later, in the dark 
of Botany Pond, I came.” Scenes 
like the one can be jarring but 
also informative for a young 
readership just learning about 
sex and relationships. Thank-
fully, my parents were either 
too busy or cool enough to let 
me continue reading the series, 
but its frank discussion of sex 
has made the “Alice” series one 
of the most frequently chal-
lenged series in schools and 
libraries in the United States.

The stories of Alice McKin-

ley emulate the mores of young 
American women in a way that 
no other series has had the 
courage to. The narratives are 
taken from a myriad of sources 
— from emails and letters from 
readers of “Alice” to Naylor’s 
own mother’s experiences in 
the early 20th century. In an 
interview with The New York-
er, Naylor aptly described that 
“What happened to women in 
1914 still resonates in (the 21st 
century).”

When I told Elizabeth, who 

is now a sophomore at Vander-
bilt University, that I was 
writing this column her first 
reaction was “I’M CRYING 
I LOVE YOU.” After calming 
down she said, “I remember 
‘Alice’ because she had these 
really great two best friends. 
Maybe it’s not that different 
from other books but it felt 
very real and honest and they 
went through a lot. Their prob-
lems and experiences weren’t 
trivialized or made to seem 
immature — they felt authentic. 
Also, I think you should men-
tion that Phyllis Reynolds Nay-
lor gave out Almond Joys when 
we went trick or treating at her 
house.”

Through Alice, Naylor 

thoughtfully explores what it 
means to be a girl and a woman 
in public spaces and fearlessly 
lets her young female readers 
know that they have power in 
this world, a revolutionary act 
in any time period. In “The 
Agony of Alice,” Alice’s teacher 
and friend, Mrs. Plotkin, tells 
her that “we grow up whether 
we’re ready or not.” These 
words are terrifying in their 
inescapability but reflective 
of Naylor herself in their very 
nature — unafraid to inspire 
action in simplicity and truth.

Lerner always enjoys it when 

you tell her “I’M CRYING I LOVE 

YOU.” If you’re in tears and in 

love, e-mail rebler@umich.edu.

‘Painting With’ is 
bland and lacking

Animal Collective 
returns, but they 
shouldn’t have

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

Since the beginning of the cen-

tury, the always abstract Animal 
Collective has been traveling down 
a long road of wonderful creations. 
Unfortunate-
ly, its newest 
release, Paint-
ing With, takes 
them 
down 

a very wrong 
path.

Painting 

With 
begins 

with 
bright 

and fast synths 
paired with vocals repeating “Flo-
flo-flo-rida,” in the song “FloriDa-
da,” and I wish it didn’t. The vocals 
sound like they could be used in a 
toothpaste commercial, and every 
component in the song is repeti-
tive and dry. Previously, Animal 
Collective has used repetition to 
great effect in their music. They 
were the epitome of the ambient 
drone, but the repeated notes in 
past albums seemed to create a 
rhythm that coincided your heart-
beat. “FloriDada” sounds repeti-
tive in an exhausting way and each 

song thereafter imitates the first, 
illuminating this unauthenticity.

The songs just travel through 

one ear and escape out the other 
because they lack personality. 
Each element in every song tries 
too hard to be recognized. They 
all wash each other out, creat-
ing a collective, irrelevant piece 
of almost nothing. None of them 
touch my heart like the 2005 
album Feels, which had every sin-
gle element strategically placed. 
Painting With’s elements felt care-
lessly thrown together.

There’s no evocation of any 

type of feeling until “Burglars” 
begins, and the feelings it does 
evoke aren’t exactly pleasant. 
“Burglars” follows the same strict, 
fast-paced sound as every other 
song off Painting With, but being 
the fifth song, it becomes irritat-
ing. Animal Collective mastered 
the strategy of atonality in their 
previous works, creating a some-
times 
life-altering 
experience 

with each listen. They allowed me 
to be high without getting high, 
which is why they were so rad. But 
“Burglars,” like every other song 
on Painting With, feels uncomfort-
able. The synths are too fast and 
the sound is too atonal. I feel my 
heartbeat increasing when I listen 
to it, and paranoia starts to creep 
over my shoulder.

“Burglars” thankfully ends and 

“Natural Selection” begins, and 

it sounds like Animal Collective 
is desperately trying to reach for 
their old style, but their arms are 
too short. The repetitions remain 
present and it feels played out. Ani-
mal Collective used to pull off this 
psychedelic ambient drone cross 
with originality, but Painting With 
sounds like a broken record.

The 
ninth 
track, 
“Spilling 

Guts,” sounds plastic compared 
to the reality of songs on previ-
ous albums. Most of these griev-
ances can be blamed on the way 
the vocals are structured in Paint-
ing With. Generally, in the older 
albums by Animal Collective, 
the instrumentals were the main 
focus. Even in vocal-heavy albums 
like Strawberry Jam, the vocals 
held one purpose: to be a guide to 
keep you grounded through the 
music’s majestic experience.

Band member Noah Lennox 

once discussed the summer the 
band first tripped on LSD, say-
ing, “everything since has been 
a variation of what we explored 
that summer,” and their experi-
ence became ours through their 
music. Their previous albums 
were personal, and each song was 
beautifully constructed with indi-
viduality. The atonality worked, 
and the vocals followed the tail 
end of each sound to create this 
avant-garde piece of art. Listening 
to them felt like a psychedelic trip, 
and Painting With is burnt-out.

Michigan’s difference

F

reshman Kate Fahey nailed 
two backhands cross court 
before hitting a forehand 

approach shot 
that pushed 
her opponent, 
Jessie Aney, 
beyond the 
baseline. 
The North 
Carolina 
freshman 
couldn’t 
control her 
next shot, 
sending the 
ball long.

Prior to the ball landing, Fahey 

looked to her left toward her 
teammates, extended her arms, 
and belted the words “Come 
on!” as loud as her lungs would 
let her. Just as she could scream 
no longer, six of her teammates 
all surrounded her to celebrate 
her win. And this was all before 
Fahey and Aney, who are close 
friends from the junior circuit, 
could even shake hands.

That could seem rude, but it’s 

not: It’s just the identity of the 
Michigan women’s tennis team.

The eighth-ranked Wolverines 

will cheer louder than any of 
their opponents — no questions 
asked. It’s what coach Ronni 
Bernstein demands, even when 
Michigan’s opponents don’t come 
anywhere close to matching her 
team’s intensity.

“We’ll have teams come in here 

and we’ll say ‘Wow, it’s so dead in 
here,’ ” Bernstein said. “I think 
all of our girls have that. It’s hard 
when the other teams don’t have 
it, but when you’re playing North 
Carolina, you definitely need it.”

That was the case on Saturday 

when the Wolverines dethroned 
No. 2 North Carolina, 5-2.

Added Fahey: “Honestly, since 

I’ve been here, between every 
team I’ve seen, we’re the loudest, 
definitely, and it helps. It throws 
(opponents) off.”

For most of the match, Fahey 

looked in control. She had played 
Aney countless times in juniors, 
yet had never beaten her. Aney 
has a style that would make any 
player cringe, including Fahey. 
The Tar Heel won’t beat you with 
power, but instead plays like a 
brick wall. And to make matters 
trickier, she slices nearly every 
backhand she takes.

This match was different, 

though. Prior to the match, 
Bernstein told Fahey that she 
needed to be more aggressive 
and get into the net — that was 
her only chance. She listened and 
executed, remaining in control 
nearly the entire match.

Her one blip, though, seemed 

significant. She had a match-point 
opportunity as she was up 5-3 in 
the second set, and found herself 
coming into the net. All she 
needed to do was smash a routine 
overhead, and her and Michigan’s 
match would be sealed. As she 
was gearing up for the shot, her 

teammates, who were watching 
from no more than 15 feet away, 
started to run toward Fahey, 
anticipating the victory.

But the ball went wide and her 

teammates awkwardly walked 
back to where they were before. 

Fahey could’ve dwelled at 

the missed opportunity. But her 
teammates’ cheers swallowed out 
any of the crowd’s gasps, as well 
as her internal emotions.

That’s Michigan women’s 

tennis.

“You could see Kate there, and 

she felt everybody in the crowd,” 
Bernstein said. “It’s a different 
dynamic.”

It’s that dynamic that 

Bernstein pines for. Not only does 
it help her team run opponents 
out of the building like it did on 
Saturday, but it’s also one of her 
key recruiting tools.

Three weeks ago, Bernstein 

hosted a blue-chip recruit for her 
team’s match against Ohio State. 
She knew the Varsity Tennis 

Center would be electric. And 
it was, despite the Wolverines 
falling, 4-2.

Still, Bernstein knows 

the recruit saw how a Ronni 
Bernstein team functions. She 
saw how every player screams 
“Go Blue!” after every point — 
yes, every point. And she saw 
how tennis could transition from 
being an individual to team sport.

“Any time (a recruit) comes to 

Ann Arbor, they see how the fans 
support our programs, and they 
want to be a part of it,” Bernstein 
said. “If they can get past the 
weather … then we are in the mix 
with any recruit.”

And if they ever make that 

decision to come to Ann Arbor, 
they’ll know one thing: It’s all 
about the team.

Because that’s Michigan 

women’s tennis.

Pitching leads ‘M’

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

Like a kid in a candy store, 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
knew he would get something 
good with whichever pitcher he 
brought to the mound during the 
Wolverines’ 
four-game 
sweep 

against Canisius.

No. 
15 
Michigan 
(4-0) 

outscored the Golden Griffins 
(0-4), 27-5, over the weekend, en 
route to its first 4-0 start since the 
2009 season.

Despite flashes of excellence at 

the plate, the series was headlined 
by the Wolverine pitching staff’s 
dominance. Between all four 
games, the Wolverines debuted 13 
different hurlers, including three 
freshmen, and just one of the five 
runs allowed was an earned run.

“They all looked to be in attack 

mode and they all competed very 
hard,” Bakich said. “Our entire 
team and our coaching staff are 
very pleased, not only with the 
three freshmen but with all of the 
pitchers.”

Junior 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock started the first game of 
the series, and he showed why he 
was named to the College Sports 
Madness Preseason Big Ten First 
Team, tossing 5.1 innings of three-
hit, no-run baseball. Adcock also 
struck out seven batters on his 
way to picking up the 9-0 win.

“Going into the first weekend 

of the year, you want to start the 
first day off with a win, and we 
did that Friday,” Adcock said.

In the first game of Saturday’s 

doubleheader, sophomore right-
hander Ryan Nutof threw four 
innings, not giving up a hit and 
allowing only one unearned run 
in the 6-2 victory.

Sophomore 
left-hander 

Michael Hendrickson relieved 
Nutof and kept Canisius hitless 
until the sixth inning, fanning 
five of the nine batters he faced. 

In the second game of the 

doubleheader, it appeared that 
senior left-hander Evan Hill 
was going to be the first starting 
pitcher to have difficulty against 
Canisius bats. But with the bases 
loaded and one out in the first 
inning, Hill struck out a batter 
and forced a pop out to escape the 
inning unscathed. 

Hill’s contributions, alongside 

the relief efforts of freshman left-
hander William Tribucher, junior 
right-hander Mac Lozer and 
sophomore right-hander Bryan 
Pall, combined to strike out 12 
batters for a 3-0 win — the second 
shutout of the series.

In the series’ final game, 

sophomore 
left-hander 
Oliver 

Jaskie got the nod. Jaskie, who 
started only one game last season, 
was electrifying in his season 
debut, tossing six innings while 
allowing just three hits and 
putting nine batters down on 
strikes. He was also named the 
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week for 
the impressive outing.

With the game out of reach, 

Bakich turned to junior right-
hander Keith Lehmann, freshman 
right-hander 
Jack 
Bredeson 

and junior left-hander Carmen 
Benedetti, who surrendered no 
hits, to close out the final three 
innings.

“The whole staff is able to show 

it can get efficient contact and get 
outs,” Adcock said. “That’s your 
starting point and you want us to 
work up to where we don’t have 
to worry about tiny mistakes. The 
defense definitely helped me out 
when I struggled.”

Adcock may have believed 

that he made mistakes on the 
mound, but the scoreboard would 
tell another story. Michigan’s 
pitching was the crux of a 
dominant four-game sweep, and 
will bode well for the Wolverines 
if they want to maintain a high 
level of play.

BASEBALL

Wolverines building postseason foundations early

Offseason training 
designed to push 
players’ physical, 

mental limits.

 

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

Though 
the 
offseason 

typically 
represents 
an 

opportunity to recover after 
a long and arduous season of 
competition, the way teams 
choose to spend their time 
off can set the tone for the 
upcoming season.

For the No. 2 Michigan 

softball team, the offseason 
wasn’t a time simply to sit back.
Even after falling just short of a 
Women’s College World Series 
title last year, the Wolverines 
knew better than to assume past 
success is an indicator of future 
results. If anything, Michigan’s 
second-place 
finish 
instilled 

a source of motivation for the 
team to tackle its offseason 
workouts in order to bridge 
the gap between itself and the 
reigning national champion, No. 
1 Florida. 

A key cornerstone of that 

regimen was the Oklahoma City 
Challenge.

Named for the site of the 

Women’s College World Series, 
the OKC Challenge pits four 
teams of Wolverines — a blue 
team, a maize team, a gray team 
and a white team — against one 
another in a three-day series 
of strength and conditioning 
challenges in the days leading 
up to Thanksgiving break.

Despite an 8-1 start to the 

season, Michigan’s lone loss 
came at the hands of the Gators, 
reminding the Wolverines why 
the OKC Challenge laid the 
foundation and set the pace for 
their offseason routine.

“The main purpose is to 

compete and to be challenged,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. “We put them into 
groups so that it’s (the) team 
competing to beat the challenge. 
We made it very difficult this 

year — we upped the ante — and 
it’s something the kids really 
embrace and work really hard 
at. You’ll have to ask them how 
much they could move over 
Thanksgiving break.”

The first day consisted of 

four timed stations — medicine 
ball burpees, sandbag runs, 
tire flips and sled pushes — 
where the team that covered 
the most distance or completed 
the most repetitions won. A 
double-elimination tug of war 
tournament topped off day one.

The 
second 
day 
followed 

a similar format, with four 
different 
timed 
stations 
— 

hurdles 
and 
ladders, 
bear 

crawls, sled pushes, medicine 
ball 
throws 
and 
weighted 

barbell carries — where distance 
and repetitions again served as 
winning objectives.

The third and final day proved 

to be the most demanding, 
courtesy of a strenuous 6 a.m. 
obstacle course that included a 
sandpit crawl, a weighted sled 

push and pull, box jumps, bear 
crawls, and a weight drag and 
sprint, capped off by a team 
relay race.

Though a winning side is 

crowned in the OKC Challenge, 
the ultimate payoff isn’t about 
the competition itself. Rather, 
the challenge 
is 
designed 

to teach the 
Wolverines 
important 
lessons about 
perseverance 
and teamwork 
that they can 
apply to the 
season ahead.

“It’s 
a 
lot 

of 
grueling 

exercises to push us really hard 
physically and see how we react 
mentally,” said junior shortstop 
Abby Ramirez. “A lot of it is just 
pushing yourself to see how far 
you can go, and I think we all 
learned how strong we are if you 
don’t give up. You can do a lot 

more than you think you can.”

During 
the 
eight-month 

absence of games, save for a 
few fall exhibitions, it can be 
difficult to recreate the feeling 
of live competition between 
seasons. 
For 
Michigan, 
the 

OKC Challenge simulates that 

experience to 
fill 
the 
void 

with energy.

“It’s 
very 

effective,” 
said fifth-year 
senior 
right-

hander 
Sara 

Driesenga. 
“It’s hard to 
find that game 
pressure 
to 

put on yourself 

when you’re just running in the 
conditioning sessions. So when 
we do competitions, that’s when 
we push ourselves. (That) is how 
we want to be out on the field, 
so we’re able to pull that out of 
nowhere when we need it.”

Though most of last year’s 

squad is returning, no team 
is exactly the same in two 
consecutive 
seasons. 
The 

offseason provides a space to 
create a new team dynamic, 
mixing and matching new and 
old players to form a cohesive 
unit. Using the OKC Challenge 
to 
its 
advantage, 
Michigan 

examined 
its 
strengths 

and 
weaknesses 
to 
better 

understand and prepare for the 
potential struggles inherent in 
its upcoming journey.

“It’s a dogfight, it’s a battle,” 

said senior captain and outfielder 
Olivia Richvalsky. “But the team 
aspect also makes you think 
about strategy, so it definitely 
correlates to what we would have 
to do on the softball field.

“You look at your team and 

you see who’s stronger in this 
area and who’s faster in this 
area and who you need to pair 
together, so the strategy that 
goes into it gets our competitive 
juices 
going. 
When 
it’s 
so 

physically exhausting, that’s the 

mental part that really comes 
out, and I think that’s the reason 
this has become such a staple.”

The title of the OKC Challenge 

is no accident. The intense 
difficulty 
of 
the 
challenge 

mirrors the onerous nature 
of the Wolverines’ journey to 
reach their ultimate destination 
— the Women’s College World 
Series 
in 
Oklahoma 
City. 

Despite having that main goal 
looming 
overhead, 
Michigan 

understands 
it 
won’t 
be 
a 

cakewalk, which explains the 
level of effort in its dedicated 
approach.

“Hutch talks a lot about one-

pitch focus,” Richvalsky said. 
“We not only narrow down the 
series to the game to the inning, 
we narrow it down to the pitch. 
It’s kind of our overarching 
mission, and that’s what keeps 
us focused every day. We have 
an end goal in mind, but we 
can’t get from zero to 100. It’s 
a progression, so I think that’s 
what keeps our perspective and 
keeps us focused.”

After 
the 
Wolverines’ 

heartbreaking 
loss 
in 
the 

Women’s College World Series 
last season, the name of the 
OKC Challenge took on more 
meaning. 
Hutchins 
made 
a 

clear effort to push her team 
even harder, knowing the team 
would need to learn how to rely 
on both their teammates and 
themselves in order to achieve 
their ultimate goal.

“We didn’t lighten up in 

their physical training at all,” 
Hutchins said. “We challenged 
them to try to push them to 
their frustration level so they 
can learn to deal with it. It’s 
not about just making them feel 
good every day, it’s about how 
they respond, because when the 
game comes, nobody feels good 
unless things all go your way. 
We try to make practice harder 
than the game so that the game 
seems easier, and I don’t know 
if we accomplished that. I guess 
we’ll find out.”

Only one game can decide if 

Hutchins pushed the Wolverines 
hard enough: A June contest in 
Oklahoma City will provide her 
answer.

An unfitting end to the Fresh Five era

N

early four years ago, 
Michigan basketball 
coach John Beilein 

welcomed 
five freshmen 
to his 
program: 
Mitch 
McGary, Nik 
Stauskas, 
Glenn 
Robinson 
III, Spike 
Albrecht and 
Caris LeVert.

The 

group was quickly dubbed the 
“Fresh Five” — an homage to 
the infamous “Fab Five” of the 
early 1990s, arguably the best 
recruiting class of all time. Four 
players in that group reached the 
NBA, and the Wolverines reached 
the NCAA championship game 
in 1991 and 1992 before a pay-for-
play scandal forced the program 
to vacate those wins.

Unlike the Fab Five, the 

Fresh Five were never a cultural 
phenomenon, and they were 
never the center of massive 
controversy. They joined a team 
already stocked with established 
stars and NBA prospects in Tim 
Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke, and 
while the Fab Five arrived in Ann 
Arbor two years after Michigan’s 
national championship in 
1989, the Fresh Five arrived 
unburdened by the trophies of 
seasons past.

The Fresh Five, dealing with 

less hype and less pressure, 
quickly made a name for 
themselves anyway. Stauskas 
quickly earned a reputation as one 
of the nation’s best pure shooters. 
Robinson proved himself to be an 
elite athlete. McGary’s freshman-
year NCAA Tournament play 
sparked a run all the way to the 
2013 national championship 
game.

Everybody remembers what 

happened next. Albrecht scored 
17 points in the first half of that 
game to give Michigan a 12-point 

lead over Louisville, and though 
the Wolverines couldn’t hold their 
lead, a legend was born. 

After an Elite Eight run the 

following season, the trio of 
Stauskas, McGary and Robinson 
were gone. Their early NBA 
Draft entries left just LeVert 
and Albrecht in Ann Arbor for 
the second half of their college 
careers.

That was never the 

expectation.

“That year, we were recruiting 

guys to be here for four years,” 
Beilein said in October. “Mitch 
was the only one that we felt 
probably wasn’t a four-year player 
at the time. I underestimated 
their DNA.”

Having lost three players to the 

NBA, Beilein and Michigan’s fan 
base recalibrated its vision for the 
future to center instead on LeVert 
and Albrecht. Once again, those 
expectations were shattered.

Expected to carry the team 

in their final season, LeVert and 
Albrecht have instead fallen 
victim to injuries, appearing in 
a combined one game in 2016. In 
LeVert’s 11-minute appearance 
Feb. 13 against Purdue, he 
suffered what Beilein called 
a “temporary setback” in his 
recovery from a mysterious 
injury to his lower left leg that 
the program has long refused to 
detail.

LeVert hasn’t seen game action 

since, and with just four regular-
season contests remaining, time is 
running out.

Relative to Albrecht, LeVert 

is lucky. Albrecht’s time ran out 
months ago, as he announced 
in December that his attempt to 
return from a pair of offseason 
hip surgeries was unsuccessful 
and that he was ending his career 
at Michigan.

“I never, in a million years, 

would have envisioned it going 
like this,” Albrecht said then. “To 
see my playing days at Michigan 
come to an end like this — that 
definitely wasn’t part of the plan.”

LeVert wears sweatpants to 

games and doesn’t emerge from 
Michigan’s locker room until 
pregame warm-ups are done. 
Albrecht joins his teammates on 
the court before games, but with 
the prospect of playing long since 
eliminated, he’s left to focus on 
his outfit instead of his jump shot 
— sometimes an eye-catching 
combination featuring red pants 
or a pink shirt.

Neither seems likely to play 

substantive minutes again for the 
Wolverines. Michigan has four 
regular-season games remaining, 
and in the unlikely event LeVert 
plays Wednesday against 
Northwestern, his minutes will be 
limited. It’s tough to imagine him 
returning in time to reintegrate 
himself into Michigan’s offense 
and return to his early-season 
form before the Big Ten 
Tournament, or the NCAA 
Tournament, if the Wolverines 
survive that long.

In the seniors’ absence, 

Michigan has shown infrequent 
glimpses of its post-Fresh Five 
identity. The Wolverines have 
lived and died by the 3-point shot 
and have been bullied inside by 
Big Ten front lines, often falling 
victim to game-ending scoring 
runs against elite opponents.

The 3-point shots haven’t fallen 

lately, and the results generally 
haven’t been pretty, save for a 
pair of home-court upsets against 
Maryland and Purdue.

It’s hard to imagine Indiana 

going on a 25-0 run at Crisler 
Center with Albrecht or LeVert 
on the floor, and it’s tough to 
imagine Michigan State jumping 
out to a 16-point halftime lead 
four days later. It’s a senior’s job 
to be a run-stopper and a rivalry-
game rally starter. But Michigan 
is a team without seniors and, 
consequently, a team that still has 
missing pieces.

LeVert has been one of the 

missing pieces before, and has 
plenty of experience rehabbing 
from long-term injuries. He 

underwent surgery in May 2014 to 
repair a stress fracture in his left 
foot, then injured the same foot 
the following January, causing 
him to miss the remainder of his 
junior year. In light of the injury, 
LeVert elected to forego the NBA 
Draft for another year and return 
for his senior season.

“He understands the process,” 

Beilein said of LeVert in October. 
“He understands God’s will. He 
is just working like crazy to do 
everything he can to take care 
of each day, and everything will 
work itself out.”

Much to the chagrin of 

Beilein, LeVert and Michigan 
fans everywhere, everything 
hasn’t worked itself out, or come 
particularly close.

LeVert and Albrecht were 

supposed to spend their final 
weeks at Michigan on the court, 

leading a team back to the NCAA 
Tournament after a 16-16 finish 
last season that came in no small 
part due to LeVert’s injury. 

The pair, who saw floor time 

together as freshmen during the 
2013 Final Four, instead seem 
destined to spend their final 
weeks at Michigan on the bench, 
sitting and watching.

“Am I happy he came back?” 

Albrecht said in October. “Heck 
yeah, I am. I didn’t want to be the 
lone senior, be the old man in the 
group by myself. … I’d be lying if I 
said I didn’t think about that, but 
at the same time, I told him, just 
know that whatever you do, I’m 
here for you and I’ll be rooting for 
you regardless.”

The plan, of course, was for 

LeVert and Albrecht to root for 
one another on the court. Instead, 
they’re keeping each other 

company on the bench, watching 
their senior years play out without 
any seniors playing.

In a twisted way, it makes sense. 

The Fresh Five were unpredictable 
from the moment they set foot 
on campus, and this four-year 
period could have ended any 
number of ways that defied belief, 
like Michigan’s 16-0 start their 
freshman season or Albrecht’s 
17-point national championship 
outburst the same year.

This ending is certainly 

unexpected, and it seems 
destined to defy belief, though in 
exactly the wrong way. Barring 
a miracle, however, this much is 
certain: The Fresh Five era wasn’t 
supposed to end like this.

Quick Hits: Joe Cecconi on 
Netflix, roomies and Lysol

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Writer

It may come as a surprise, 

but freshman defenseman Joe 
Cecconi’s plus-17 plus-minus rating 
leads all of his fellow defensemen 
in that statistical category.

For that reason, Cecconi joined 

the Daily for this week’s edition of 
Quick Hits.

The Michigan Daily: You lead 

all defensemen on this team in 
plus-minus. Do you rub that in 
their faces?

Cecconi: (Laughs) No, I don’t 

rub it in. I take pride in that.

TMD: 
(Junior 
defenseman 

Michael) Downing said we should 
ask about not having a goal.

Cecconi: Well, it’s coming. 

Hopefully, it’s coming. He teases 
me that there is something I can 
do to break the slump, but that’s a 
secret. I might have to pull it off.

TMD: We won’t ask what that 

is (laughs). Well what was it like 
rooming with (freshman forward) 
Cooper Marody while he had 
mono? Was he always asleep?

Cecconi: He actually went 

home. He lives 20 minutes away 
and he went home for three weeks, 
so I didn’t have to worry about 
anything.

TMD: Did you clean up his 

area? Disinfect it?

Cecconi: Yeah, lots of Lysol. A 

lot of cleaning. It’s still a mess.

TMD: Who is messier, you or 

Cooper?

Cecconi: Cooper. I always 

clean up. His side of the room is 
disgusting. He’s got all his guitars 
and his amps and all that crap 
everywhere.

TMD: Is it annoying living with 

somebody who makes so much 
noise making music?

Cecconi: He actually goes 

downstairs, 
to 
be 
honest. 

Sometimes 
he’ll 
give 
me 
a 

performance, and I’ll be tired and 
it helps me fall asleep, so it’s good.

TMD: 
Why 
weren’t 
you 

featured in his recent song?

Cecconi: I don’t know. I got to 

talk to him about that. I’m not too 
happy.

TMD: What were your thoughts 

about that song?

Cecconi: I think I heard the 

first 10 seconds; I didn’t really 
listen to it (laughs). I’ll look at it 
tonight.

TMD: What did you think 

of (sophomore) Cutler Martin 
(playing) 
forward 
(this 
past 

weekend)?

Cecconi: I liked that. Big body 

up front that can hit. He brings a 
lot of energy to the line.

TMD: Have you ever made 

(coach) Red Berenson laugh?

Cecconi: Me, personally? I 

don’t think so. I think I’ve gotten 
a couple of grins or smirks. I’m not 
sure if I got a laugh.

TMD: Cooper told us to ask 

what you said to your grandpa 
about eating the free dining hall 
food.

Cecconi: So, everyone knows 

about the virus going around 

and I really didn’t want to 
eat that food and get sick. My 
grandpa and I have a really good 
relationship, and I say some 
funny things to him from time 
to time, so I told him that you 
can’t put regular fuel in a Ferrari 
and he loved it. He actually put 
money on my card to go eat 
somewhere else.

TMD: (Laughs) That’s just 

practical. I mean, you can’t get sick.

Cecconi: We got a big weekend 

ahead of us.

TMD: Were you happy to get 

out of Muskegon? (Cecconi played 
for the Muskegon Lumberjacks in 
the United States Hockey League 
prior to Michigan.)

Cecconi: I was happy to move 

on to be on my own. I had a billet 
family there, but now I just have 
Cooper. So there are no parents 
who tell me I can’t stay up late.

TMD: Cooper doesn’t tell you 

not to stay up late?

Cecconi: He’s the one who stays 

up all the time watching Netflix.

TMD: He told us that you 

needed to watch a show, “Chuck,” 
and you were against it and then 
watched the whole thing.

Cecconi: He told me to watch 

“Chuck” and I looked at it and it 
looked stupid. And I got bored 
one day and turned it on. The first 
episode was all right, the second 
episode was good and then it was 
just unreal, so I crushed it all in 
two weeks.

TMD: You don’t give him the 

satisfaction of telling him that?

Cecconi: No (laughs). Now he 

tells me to watch “The Office,” but 
I’m already watching something 
good. So I kind of just blow him off.

TMD: We saw a sheet in 

Madison that had the roommate 
pairings. Why did you have your 
own hotel room in Wisconsin?

Cecconi: According to it, I had 

my own room. But I opened the 
door and Cutler Martin was laying 
in the other bed (laughs).

‘M’ looks to keep 
up recent success

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has two games 
left to prove itself and climb 
the 
Big 
Ten 

standings.

After 
a 

bumpy start to 
the conference 
schedule, 
the 

Wolverines 
(8-8 Big Ten, 
16-11 
overall) 

have won four 
of their last five 
games, 
which 

has them tied 
with 
Purdue 

and 
Nebraska 

at the No. 6 
spot in the Big 
Ten.

Coming off a 79-73 win 

against Penn State last weekend, 
Michigan heads to Northwestern 
(4-12, 15-13) on Tuesday.

“(Beating Penn State) was 

good,” 
sophomore 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty said after 
the Wolverines’ win Saturday. 
“It just gives us confidence. 
It’s a big win today. They just 
beat Northwestern. They beat 
Michigan State. It’s going to give 
us momentum going into the last 
two games.”

Michigan will meet forward 

Nia Coffey against the Wildcats 
— a 2014 second-team All-Big 
Ten selection.

Coffey averages a double-

double with 19.6 points and 10.3 
rebounds per game.

She 
is 
by 
no 
means 

Northwestern’s 
only 
option, 

though. Five Wildcats average 
double digits — guard Maggie 
Lyon is the next highest with 
17.0 points, and guard Christen 
Inman follows her with 14.4. 
Forward 
Pallas 
Kunaiyi-

Akpanah 
and 
guard 
Ashley 

Deary also average 13.0 and 12.6, 
respectively.

Under the basket, Coffey will 

be met by Michigan freshman 

Hallie Thome. While Thome will 
have the height advantage — she 
is 6-foot-5 — there have been 
times this season when more 
experienced, 
veteran 
players 

have outmuscled the Wolverine 
freshman.

Coffey could pose a similar 

threat in the post.

Out on the wings, Michigan 

will likely have the advantage. 
The Wolverines’ offense is led by 
Flaherty, whose 22.5 points per 
game is the seventh highest in the 
nation and third highest in the 
Big Ten. Flaherty, senior guard 
Madison Ristovski and junior 
guard Siera Thompson have 
combined to shoot 39.2 percent on 
3-pointers this year — 7-percent 
higher 
than 
Northwestern’s 

three starting guards. But the 
Wolverines’ backcourt does more 
than just drain 3-pointers.

While 
Flaherty 
leads 
the 

offense, Thompson captains the 
defensive efforts with a team-
high 37 steals.

Northwestern has taken top 

Big Ten opponents to the wire 
this year, beating No. 5 Ohio 
State by four points the first 
time they met, and losing by just 
six in the second meeting.

While 
the 
frontloaded 

schedule put Michigan in a 
rut through most of January, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
taken 

advantage 
of 
their 
weaker 

opponents to earn a higher Big 
Ten Tournament seed.

Moving up in the standings 

won’t be easy, though, as the 
five middle teams in the Big 
Ten — Iowa, Rutgers, Purdue, 
Michigan and Nebraska — are 
jammed into a race for seedings. 
Both the Hawkeyes and Scarlet 
Knights have 7-9 conference 
records, putting them both only 
a game behind the three-way tie 
in the No. 6 spot.

Tuesday’s 
game 
against 

the Wildcats, Michigan’s only 
scheduled meeting with them 
this season, gives the Wolverines 
the chance to move above .500 in 
conference play for the first time.
