Though 
many 
of 
the 

campaign promises made by 
the newMich platform were 
attacked as idealistic by their 
opposition, the University of 
Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government’s 
administration 

led by President David Schafer, 
LSA senior, and Vice President 
Micah Griggs, LSA senior, has 
laid considerable groundwork 
to fulfill some of their directives 
for the next semester.

While many of the body’s 

directives, like mental health 
or divestment, are not being 
introduced for the first time 

this semester, the assembly 
has also contended with issues 
surrounding racial tension — in 
particular, tension surrounding 
undocumented 
students 

and 
minorities 
on 
campus 

mounted after President-elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 
November 

victory. During the campaign, 
Trump called for an increase 
in 
immigration 
restrictions 

and perpetuated anti-Muslim 
rhetoric.

In response to this — in 

particular, 
Trump’s 
stated 

intention to reverse a executive 
order, the Deferred Action for 
Childhood 
Arrival 
program, 

allowing many undocumented 
students to stay in the country 
— CSG passed a resolution in 

For Art & Design senior 

Kelsi Franzino, helping cities 
and neighborhoods like Detroit 
which are facing infrastructural 
issues is not about intervention 
— it’s about support.

During 
the 
winter 
2016 

semester, Franzino and her 
classmates in Art & Design 
Prof. Hannah Smotrich’s visual 
identity design class partnered 
with Brightmoor Maker Space, 
a community workshop for 
building skills to design a logo 
and marketing platform for 
BMS. BMS was founded by Art 
& Design Prof. Nick Tobier and 
Bart Eddy, Detroit Community 
Schools co-founder, in 2015, 
though it is currently facilitated 
by the community of Brightmoor 
and 
Detroit 
Community 

Schools and is located at their 
warehouse on the campus of 
Detroit Community Schools.

At the end of the semester, 

Franzino’s logo, featuring the 
words Brightmoor and Makers, 
connected 
by 
geometrical 

supports, 
was 
chosen 
to 

be implemented across the 
organization.

“I kind of created this support 

system in it,” she said. “Showing 
that support and how (BMS) 
helps out their neighbors (was 
important).”

Located near the northwest 

border of Detroit, Brightmoor 
is one of the most impoverished 
neighborhoods in the city. From 

2000 ti 2010, the city saw a 36 
percent drop in population to 
12,836. Several journalists who 
have visited the areas have 
painted pictures that aren’t 
positive by far, such as Rollo 
Romig’s article in The New 
Yorker, “When You’ve Had 
Detroit.”

“Much 
of 
Brightmoor 

matches what Detroit looks like 
in the popular imagination—an 
alarming amalgam of city dump, 

crime scene, and wild prairie,” 
Romig wrote.

However, residents of the 

community are quick to point 
to 
increasing 
beautification 

efforts in the neighborhood, 
such as large murals on the sides 
of buildings and community 
gardens. Many believe that 
through 
neighborhood 

organizations, church groups 
and 
innovation 
from 
both 

residents and the University, 

perceptions of the area are 
beginning to shift.

In a video produced by BMS, 

Dennis Talbert, interim chair 
of the Brightmoor Community 
Center, 
said 
outsiders 
can 

misconstrue the strength of the 
community, and BMS is working 
to combat this negative rhetoric 
through innovation.

“When 
you 
think 
about 

Brightmoor, you have to kind 

Researchers at the University of 

Michigan have been taking a new 
approach to the long unresolved 
challenge of developing a working 
cure for HIV/AIDS by looking 
at natural properties possessed 
by bacteria that live on coral, 
according to research released this 
week.

The bacteria — called marine 

actinomycetes 
— 
produce 

substances that inhibit a protein in 
HIV cells, enabling the bacteria to 
resist the human body’s immune 
system in a curative, rather than 
preventative, way. Unlike other 
research, which has attempted 
to target the HIV virus’s ability 
to infect cells, this approach 
seeks to develop a new type of 
drug that would target already 
infected 
cells, 
according 
to 

Kathleen Collins, lead researcher 
and 
University 
professor 
of 

immunology and microbiology, in 
an email interview.

Collins wrote in an email 

interview that many existing 
drugs are able to reduce levels 
of the virus present in the body, 
but fail to eradicate cells already

It’s not uncommon for students 

at the University of Michigan 
to come across a number of 
administration-sponsored 
fliers, 

emails and posting boards in the 
Diag touting the University as the 
Leaders and Best — a trend that 
spiked following this October’s 
release of a five-year strategic plan 
for diversity, equity and inclusion.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s DEI initiative was met 
with state and national media 
attention following its release, 

but many also questioned the 
University’s planned $85 million 
investment into the initiative over 
the next five years.

Despite national attention on 

the University’s diversity plans, a 
survey of the DEI plan alongside 
those of peer institutions reveals 
the initiative is not unlike those 
at similar institutions, but rather 

builds on existing practices with 
a unique decentralized planning 
process, coordination and new 
measures of accountability.

Planning for the University’s 

initiative began in September 2015, 
when 49 units across campus were 
charged with submitting a strategic 
plan for their respective areas, all of

Monday 
night, 
about 
50 

Ann Arbor residents attended 
the Ann Arbor City Council’s 
annual budget planning session, 
with the majority expressing a 
desire for increased attention 
on 
pedestrian 
safety. 
Most 

of the audience consisted of 
members of A2 Safe Transport, 
a citizen’s group advocating for 
improvements to transportation 
safety in Ann Arbor.

A2 Safe Transport formed 

in response to a recent series of 
accidents that have resulted in 
the injury and death of several 
pedestrians –– most recently, the 
death of Ann Arbor high school 
student Qi-Xuan “Justin” Tang at 
a crosswalk on Fuller Road near 
Huron High School.

A2 Safe Transport member 

Claire Duvernoy, an Ann Arbor 
resident, stressed the need for 
immediate City Council action 
on pedestrian safety during 
public commentary.

“My child crosses Fuller Road 

every single day to go to Huron 
High School, and Justin Tang 
was his friend,” Duvernoy said.

support 
of 
undocumented 

students on campus earlier this 
year. DACA, as explained by the 
resolution, allows immigrants 
to 
“apply 
for 
temporary 

deferrals of deportations and 
(for) work permits.”

“I just wanted to highlight 

the 
importance 
of 
this 

resolution,” 
Schafer 
said 

during the November meeting. 
“I think it’s our job to stand in 
support of our undocumented 
students on this campus and 
reaffirm their place in the 
University of Michigan and 
to show that CSG is here for 
them.”

The administration has also 

focused on several goals from 
their campaign. Though they 
haven’t fulfulled their full 
campaign promise to create 
a student regent position, the 
assembly did strive to increase 
transparency 
between 

the student body and the 
University’s Board of Regents 
by passing a resolution at 

its first meeting to reinstate 
student input into the board’s 
bylaws in hopes of adding more 
student perspective to board 
decisions. In early September, 
the board voted and passed a 
bylaw to do so.

“That 
bylaw 
highlights 

the 
importance 
of 
student 

input in University decision 
making,” Schafer said during 
the meeting. “To reiterate, 
let’s not view this bylaw as the 
final product but rather as a 
foundation upon which more 
specific efforts can be built 
that match the spirit of this 
bylaw.”

Other campaign initiatives 

that targeted drinking and 
wellness have also been at 
least in part fulfilled. At the 
beginning of the year, CSG 
started off with plans to reduce 
alcohol-related incidents on 
game days by partnering with 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 

to create hydration stations. 
In early September, CSG also 
hosted its third sober tailgate 
in five years. LSA sophomore 
Grant 
Rivas, 
CSG’s 
chief 

programming officer, said at 
the time they served 350 pizzas 

and 1,600 water bottles during 
the event.

CSG also undertook mental 

health initiatives. In October, 
the student government sent 
out a survey to University 
faculty and students to gauge 
their perspective of student 
mental health. In addition, 
Schafer launched the first-
ever mental health taskforce to 
analyze data from the survey 
and create initiatives resulting 
from their research. According 
to an interview with Schafer, 
the taskforce is currently still 
in its research stage.

Another prominent but not 

unusual concern for the body 
was their debate this semester 
over a resolution that would 
have called on the University 
to 
divest 
its 
investments 

in 
several 
companies 
that 

allegedly commit human rights 
violations against Palestinians. 
The resolution, brought by 
Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality, failed with 34 to 
13. It has been brought to the 
body unsuccesfully by SAFE 
multiple times in the past 
decade. 

CSG’s 
failure 
to 
pass 

the 
resolution 
prompted 

frustration 
from 
some 

students, most notably at a 
walkout on campus that drew 
more than 1000 students. At 
the event, some Palestinian 
students 
described 
their 

frustrations 
with 
the 

student government over the 
resolution, calling for more 
solidarity from the body.

The question of advocacy 

versus 
lobbying 
was 
also 

a major debate in one CSG 
meeting, in which members 
discussed 
passing 
the 

resolution to show support 
for activist Justin Cheong 
from By All Means Necessary, 
a 
national 
coalition 
that 

aims to defend affirmative 
action, immigrant rights and 
equality.

LSA senior Joey Hansel, 

CSG student general counsel, 
expressed concerns about the 
resolution leading to legal 
issues.

of think about Brightmoor from 
a different perspective,” he said. 
“Some see it as blight, others see 
it as an opportunity.”

The BMS project as a whole, 

which began through a donation 
platform on crowd funding site 
Patronicity, met its goal of $25,000 
on July 10, 2015 and subsequently 
received an additional $25,000 
from the Michigan Economic 
Development 
Corporation. 

According to its website, the 
money raised from the donation 
drive was used to renovate 
the vacant building on Detroit 
Community Schools’ campus, buy 
tools and materials — bringing 
together community resources 

to support skill-building and 
entrepreneurship — and build 
the infrastructure to make BMS 
sustainable over time.

The money also funds other 

projects spawned from BMS, 
which 
include 
a 
gardening 

collective 
that 
gives 
fresh 

vegetables 
to 
residents 
in 

the 
neighborhood 
and 
an 

organization where a group builds 
large tricycles for the purpose of 
transporting clean water.

Franzino said after her class 

visited BMS and was able to talk to 
the project’s key stakeholders and 
former students of the program, 
they were better equipped for 
what the client was looking for in 
terms of branding.

“We had to figure out what the 

Brightmoor Maker Space was 
all about and what their goals 
were,” Franzino said. “One of the 

biggest challenges in designing 
for the Brightmoor Maker Space 
is thinking outside of the box 
because a lot of the initial ideas 
were very literal, like tools and 
things like that, so trying to 
reimagine what a maker space is 
and what it does and for them, it’s 
kind of all about community.”

Smotrich wrote in an article 

on the Art & Design website that 
through these meetings with 
BMS staff and with Tobier and 
Eddy, she and her classmates 
were given the opportunity to see 
what working with clients would 
be like, and how an organization 
like BMS can affect students in 
the area.

“Stamps students were able to 

develop a fuller understanding 
of the goals for the maker space 
and make a strong connection to 
Detroit Community High School 

students and their creative work,” 
she said.

After reading the BMS mission 

statement, Franzino said she and 
her class got to work on designing, 
and 
received 
critiques 
along 

the way from BMS alumni and 
mentors. Though her logo design 
received positive feedback from 

Tobier at the end of the course, 
she was surprised to have won.

“I wasn’t really expecting it 

and I wasn’t really sure they were 
going to end up choosing one of 
our designs so I was pretty happy 
to be selected,” she said.

Franzino said she saw BMS as 

a valuable resource in Brightmoor 

due to its ability to provide 
students with design skills not 
often offered in school.

“I think probably the most 

important thing is that it gives 
the kids an education that they’re 
not getting in the public school 
system,” she said.

which were ultimately rolled into a 
campus-wide strategy this summer.

Just before the release of the 

plan in October 2016, fliers posted 
around campus demeaned the 
humanity of Black, Muslim and 
LGBTQ people, inciting protests 
by hundreds of students calling 
for an administrative response. 
Many students later criticized the 
release of the plan as a reactionary 
approach to calming racial tensions 
on campus. Students also pointed 
to issues with the long-term nature 
of the DEI, which is benchmarked 
to five years from now, chanting 
slogans like “Why wait for 2025, 
will I even be alive?” in demands 
for more immediate action from 
Schlissel.

At a panel on campus safety and 

racism sponsored by the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center Thursday, Dec. 8, LSA senior 
Sabrina Bilimoria, who also is an 
Michigan in Color editor at the Daily, 
criticized the DEI plan for asking for 
more mental and emotional labor 
from marginalized students.

“The DEI initiatives are bullshit,” 

Bilimoria said to applause from panel 
attendees. “... Very little is done on 
an institutional level. There’s such a 
lack of understanding from Schlissel 
and many, many administrators as 
to a common way to talk to students 
without tokenizing them and asking 
minority students to do all the 
work.”

In an interview, Katrina Wade-

Golden, assistant vice provost and 
director of implementation for the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Strategic Plan, agreed campus 
racial tensions during the semester 
affected the perception of the plan’s 
rollout, though she noted the plan 
was not released in response to 
protests.

“We were not reacting to any 

particular kind of incident, and we 
really wanted to be proactive,” she 
said.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
the 

University’s 
vice 
president 
for 

student life, said the University 
administration’s commitment to 
improving campus diversity has 
existed since 1988 with the The 
Michigan 
Mandate, 
launched 

by 
then-University 
President 

James Duderstadt, which focused 
on 
recruitment 
of 
prospective 

students. The initiative largely 
succeeded 
in 
significantly 

raising 
underrepresented 

minority enrollment and faculty 
appointments — though a number 
of initiatives also aimed at creating 
an inclusive campus climate. Black 
enrollment has been decreasing 
substantially on the University 
campus. 
According 
to 
the 

University Ten Year Enrollment 
by Ethnicity report, in 2006, 7.2 
percent of University enrollment 
was Black. However, over the past 
nine years, Black enrollment has 
been decreasing, as in 2015, Blacks 
only accounted for 4.8 percent of 
enrollment.

Despite the mandate, statewide 

attacks 
on 
affirmative 
action 

eventually culminated in 2006 
with Proposition 2, a statewide 
ban 
on 
the 
consideration 
of 

race in admissions to Michigan 
universities 
the 
U.S. 
Supreme 

Court upheld in 2014, aligned with 
drops 
in 
minority 
enrollment. 

Duderstadt 
also 
criticized 
his 

successor, Lee Bollinger, for doing 
away with funding and resources 
allocated toward the mandate, 
which eventually faded out of 
existence. During her tenure as the 
University’s president, starting in 
the early 2000s, Mary Sue Coleman 
also launched initiatives to increase 
minority enrollment.

Student demands about the DEI 

plan tend to focus on boosting the 
proportion of minority students in 
the student body — a figure that 
has hovered consistently around 13 
percent for the last five years.

Harper said those levels may 

never rise significantly without 
affirmative action, noting that 
recruitment 
efforts 
in 
the 

DEI represent something of a 
workaround. Programs such as 
Wolverine Pathways and HAIL 
Scholars — both outlined in the 
DEI plan — instead aim to funnel 
marginalized students toward the 
University with primary education 
pipelines and scholarships.

“Why would anyone expect the 

numbers to be the same without 
affirmative action?” Harper said. 
“But you start thinking about 
different strategies for getting 
that done. Students have to be 
willing to get in some of those 

elementary schools, they have to 
vote for education and be part of 
organizations giving back. There’s 
a notion that you can be finished 
with this work, and that’s just not 
true.” 

The University may take a 

step further in its approach to 
maintaining 
campus 
inclusion 

when 
compared 
to 
peer 

institutions with active diversity 
plans including the University of 
California-Berkeley, the University 
of Maryland and Brown University 
— amid these institutions, the 
University’s 
combination 
of 

multifaceted, unit-specific goals 
with broader, overarching goals 
stands out.

For instance, schools such as 

Duke University, University of 
North Carolina-Chapel Hill and 
UC-Berkeley that already promote 
unit-specific strategic plans lack 
the umbrella structure of the 
DEI promoted by the University’s 
executive 
leadership, 
but 
do 

indicate needs for it. UNC’s 2014 
diversity 
report, 
for 
example, 

includes 
recommendations 
for 

a 
“coordinated 
institutional 

strategy,” while Duke calls for 
a 
“university-wide 
statement 

affirming our commitment to 
diversity.”

The parts of the DEI plan 

receiving 
the 
most 
publicity, 

however, are already in place at 
other institutions. From 2007 
to 2012, Ohio State University 
successfully 
implemented 
a 

diversity scholars network and met 
goals of hiring more female and 

underrepresented minority faculty. 
A number of schools already 
appoint chief diversity officers, 
as outlined in the University’s 
plan as well. Brown University’s 
plan released this February — the 
model perhaps most comparable 
to the DEI — devotes $165 
million to initiatives including a 
postdoctorate to faculty pipeline an 
improved summer bridge program 
and a first-generation student 
center, similar to pushes in the DEI 
plan.

Tabbaye Chavous, director of the 

National Center on Institutional 
Diversity 
at 
the 
University, 

acknowledged individual elements 
of the DEI were not unique 
compared to other institutions. 
He pointed to a semester rife with 
racial tension on campus as a 
possible reason for the spotlight on 
the DEI.

“A lot of the work and efforts 

are not necessarily new ideas, but 
might be new in cooperation,” 
she said. “Michigan is a place 
where 
when 
these 
things 

happen, attention is drawn to it, 
because we’re a place that’s been 
working on diversity issues and 
we’ve stated our commitment 
to those values. This seeming 
contradiction does feel striking, 
but this DEI plan is one thing … 
that will position us to move on 
these efforts in new ways.” 

Wade-Golden 
also 
hailed 

efforts increasing faculty and 
staff diversity and emphasized 
the DEI would not go the way of 
the Michigan Mandate with its 

measures of accountability and 
focus on equity and inclusion. 
In particular, she noted that 
contributions 
to 
DEI-specific 

goals will be taken into account 
in faculty performance reviews 
and recommendations for tenure, 
and deans must submit annual 
reports on college-specific DEI 
initiatives.

“The 
mandate 
was 

groundbreaking and really before 
its time, actually,” she said. 
“Now, we definitely have top 
administrative support in terms of 
the president and the provost. I’m 
sure you’ve seen the commitment 
allocated in $85 million, and our 
robust accountability structure 
really sets us apart from anything 
happening nationally.”

A campus climate survey to 

be distributed next semester 
will establish baseline metrics 
to assess the DEI’s success, and 
Chavous said the plan’s efficacy 
will ultimately hinge on the 
University’s ability to balance 
short-term needs of students and 
long-term institutional goals.

“The experiences of students 

are unique relative to faculty 
and staff in that you’re here for a 
much shorter time,” she said. “It 
really is a more immediate issue 
for students than faculty and 
administrators who are used to 
the long haul. If we can balance 
that, if Michigan can be a model of 
a positive way to work effectively 
on these issues, I think we can 
affect the broader society.”

infected in the system.

“None of the available drugs 

are effective at getting rid of the 
cells,” she wrote. “Our approach 
inhibits an HIV protein that makes 
the infected cells resistant to the 
immune system. We expect that 
our drug would help the immune 
system find and kill the infected 
cells.”

Collins, 
who 
has 
been 

researching HIV/AIDS for many 
years, wrote she screened these 
particular 
bacteria 
for 
about 

five years in collaboration with 
University microbiologist David 
Sherman and the Life Sciences 
Institute’s Center for Chemical 
Genomics.

After many years dedicated to 

the research of Nef — the protein 
responsible for concealing the 
virus — Collins wrote this the 
work looks promising, though she 
acknowledged there is still a lot of 
work to do.

“So far, the drugs look very 

potent and non-toxic in tissue 
culture cells - so they are as 

promising as they could be at 
this stage,” she wrote. “However, 
more work needs to be done to 
understand the full potential of our 
compounds.”

Epidemiology 
Prof. 
Powel 

Kazanjian, chief of the University’s 
division of infectious diseases, 
wrote in an email interview that 
Collins’ research — despite being 
in the developmental stage — 
holds some promise to address 
shortcomings of currently available 
drugs, namely their inability to 
fully eliminate the virus from the 
body.

“It is at a very early stage, but 

it has the potential to make an 
important 
impact,” 
he 
wrote. 

“Right now we have drugs that 
suppress viral replication and need 
to be given for a lifetime. A cure for 
HIV would avoid the lifelong use of 
drugs.”

According 
to 
a 
blog 
post 

published by the University of 
Michigan Health System’s Health 
Lab, Collins and her team began 
with 10 compounds and have been 
able to focus in on three that hold 
the greatest potential for inhibiting 
Nef.

Currently, the work is funded 

by 
the 
University’s 
medical 

research institute and the National 
Institutes of Health. Collins wrote 
that limited funding is one of the 
primary challenges facing the 
research’s ability to move forward 
quickly and eventually reach the 
stage of clinical testing in human 
patients.

“We have a limited amount 

of funds to try all the things that 
we would like to try to enhance 
production of the compound by 
the bacteria,” she wrote. “NIH 
funding is generally not adequate 
for developing drugs and drug 
companies often don’t become 
interested unless a lot of work has 
already been done to show the drug 
will be effective.”

Despite challenges of funding 

and understanding of the disease, 
Collins wrote she hopes to continue 
to research the mechanisms that 
viruses use to evade and resist the 
body’s immune system, not just in 
HIV/AIDS but other dangerous 
viruses as well.

“In 5-10 years, I expect that 

we will continue to be focused on 
what viruses do to resist immune 
detection and eradication so that 
we can refine our approaches 
to eliminate a wide variety of 
persistent viruses,” she wrote.

“We can’t let that happen again.”

During the public comment 

portion of the meeting, multiple 
other 
A2 
Safe 
Transport 

members demanded the council 
take immediate action by hiring 
crossing guards and creating 
“school zones” with appropriate 
signage.

Last year, prior to Tang’s death, 

the city’s Pedestrian Safety and 
Task Force committee introduced 
“Vision Zero” to the council, a 
report brought to council for 
review that presented to goal of 

completely eliminating deaths 
and injuries of pedestrians.

However, when the “Vision 

Zero” initiative was brought up 
again during Monday evening’s 
session, 
City 
Administrator 

Howard Lazarus urged caution 
on such absolute goals.

“There are formal Vision Zero 

programs, so, if that’s the desire of 
the council to have a Vision Zero 
program, just realize what that 
means,” Lazarus said.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) agreed 
with A2 Safe Transport members 
that the city’s resources would be 
better spent specifically in the areas 
of greatest concern, like school 
zones.

“I also realize that not every 

crosswalk will be updated within the 
first year, but how I would go about 
prioritizing something like safety is 
starting from the most vulnerable,” 
she said. “So for me I feel like 
children are the most vulnerable and 
that’s where we start.”

Along 
with 
the 
immediate 

action suggested by the group, 
A2 Safe Transport members also 
touted a longer term measure — 
increasing driver compliance with 
the crosswalk law via increased 
police 
enforcement. 
The 
law 

currently states a driver must stop 
for a pedestrian in the crosswalk or 
waiting to cross.

W

ith the arrival of the 
cold of winter, let 
us warm ourselves 

around the raging dumpster fire 
that 
is 
American 

politics. This holiday 
season will be the 
final one of the Obama 
administration, 
and 

with that departure, 
Americans 
may 
be 

asked to abandon the 
concept 
of 
“facts.” 

Yes, the millions of 
Caucasian 
patriots 

who heroically elected 
international 
steak 

salesman/host of “The 
Celebrity 
Apprentice,” 
Donald 

Trump, have actually determined 
that “facts” do not matter. And in 
my opinion, this issue indicates 
the importance of two things: 
preserving learning and striving 
for intellect.

If this election has offered 

any tangible evidence of the 
current status of the collective 
American intellect, it is that the 
necessity for factual evidence or 
truth behind outlandish claims 
and statements is no longer 
necessary. No, Americans need 
only to “feel” like something is 
true. Americans only need to 
“feel” like President Obama is 
a secret Muslim, or “feel” like 
3 million illegal aliens voted 
in 
California 
this 
election, 

or “feel” like crime, poverty 
and unemployment are all on 
the rise. And in regard to the 
concrete evidence produced by 
credible news organizations and 
non-partisan research centers, 
well, in the of words of Newt 
Gingrich, “liberals have a whole 
set of statistics that theoretically 
may be right, but it’s not where 
human beings are.”

Congratulations, for we are 

now entering a new era where 
misinformed 
and 
uneducated 

opinions are far more valid 
than fact because that’s just how 
Americans feel, damn it! In tandem 
with our departure from the real 
world, we have also elevated fake 
news 
and 
Facebook 
clickbait 

stories 
into 
national 
political 

discourse. The ridiculous posts we 
all saw about our Kenyan, Muslim 
comrade, Obama, waging war on 
Christianity were simply chalked 

up as that one racist 
uncle of ours having 
a slow Tuesday night. 
Yet now, individuals 
like noted conspiracy 
theorist Alex Jones 
and 
Tomi 
Lahren, 

future 
Fox 
News 

morning 
co-host, 

have been elevated, in 
public regard, to the 
uppermost levels of 
contemporary political 
journalism 
such 
as 

NBC’s Chuck Todd or CNN’s Jake 
Tapper. Instead of producing 
unbiased, 
factually 
accurate, 

hard-hitting 
journalism, 
they 

investigate whether juice boxes 
have chemicals that are turning 
children gay and how Black-on-
Black crime is the real issue Black 
Lives Matter should be addressing.

We enter our new era led by our 

“blue-collar,” billionaire president-
elect, who, from within his golden 
penthouse atop a skyscraper in 
Manhattan, 
will 
patriotically 

drag all of America into a political 
atmosphere so laughable it feels 
like an episode of “South Park.” 
Flanked on his right will be the 
Republicans that placed party over 
nation and went from condemning 
him as future sexual-assaulter-in-
chief, to obeying him like pathetic 
dogs (Now, sit, Reince. Roll over, 
Mitt, roll over.) And on Trump’s 
left, or shall I say “alt-right,” will be 
the real ambitious members of the 
administration: men such as chief 
strategist Steve Bannon, National 
Security Adviser Mike Flynn and 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions. 
Men who are all too giddy over the 
fact that so far their boss’s Twitter 
tantrums distract the national 
spotlight from their deplorable 
racist and xenophobic pasts.

With the approach of this 

fact-free 
administration 
and 

future, 
economists, 
historians 

and political scientists will more 
than likely analyze the multiple 
factors that contributed to how 
we have arrived here. And one of 

those key factors will be related 
to education and learning, and 
more importantly, how we treat 
the drive for higher intelligence 
within this country. For in order 
for our fact-free and intellect-
absent world to develop, we must 
have forgotten how remarkably 
incredible real learning can be.

A recent TED Talk given by 

noted author and nerd archetype, 
John Green, compared learning 
to cartography. He argued that 
learning is not a straight line or 
organized checklist — instead, 
it’s a messy, uneven, spotty 
and sporadic experience. True 
learning 
requires 
individuals 

to somehow discover a passion 
unbeknown to them that drives 
them to stumble upon books, 
magazines or videos in order to 
gratify the mental hunger that 
overtakes them. Whether it be 
astrophysics or ancient Roman 
history, the uneven conquest of 
the unknown is strongly similar 
to the disorganized methods 
of early cartography, in which 
rough sketches of coastlines and 
measurements of land culminated 
in fuzzy maps attempting to chart 
a seemingly endless world.

And as students, we almost 

haphazardly 
stumble 
around 

learning, not only within the 
classroom, but through other 
acts as well. We piece together 
information, adding slices and 
fragments of data to an ever-
growing map that slowly, over the 
progression of years, comes into 
focus. It grants us an ability to look 
out at on a massive horizon and 
over time, more accurately and 
precisely describe what we see 
in front of us. Every book, article, 
Khan Academy video or TED Talk 
clarifies and defines the rough 
draft of intellect within our minds.

And eventually that messy map 

becomes something remarkably 
beautiful. It becomes full of factual 
evidence and known “knowns.”

I

n the wake of the 2016 
election, 
the 
Electoral 

College has come under fire 

by those on the left. In what was 
certainly a surprising election, the 
Democratic Party and 
many of those on the 
left have taken clear 
steps to undermine 
the 
political 

institution that is the 
Electoral College.

Many, 
including 

myself, 
argue 
that 

Hillary Clinton lost 
on Nov. 8 in large part 
due to the fact that 
the electorate was 
looking for an outsider. Sick of the 
political correctness — from giving 
every child a trophy to limiting 
when it’s OK to say “Merry 
Christmas” — many Americans 
were looking for a different type 
of leader, not afraid to express his 
or her true opinions. Whether you 
agree with President-elect Donald 
Trump on his policies or not, it’s 
clear that he’s different than any 
political leader we’ve ever had. 
This has made many who disagree 
with Trump upset, so much so that 
they’ve actually been calling 
for the abolishment of the 
Electoral College.

I get that Clinton supporters 

are upset that they lost. But while 
a popular vote system would’ve 
ended with a President Clinton, 
neither 
candidate 
received 
a 

majority of the popular vote — 
neither candidate could get over 
half of the population to support 
them because not everyone votes. 
These cries simply demonstrate 
the left’s mindset when it comes 
to losing: Everyone deserves a 
trophy and nobody (unless your 
name is Trump) deserves to lose. 
When they finally did lose, they 
ultimately chose to act immaturely, 
cry foul and fight for a complete 
change in the rules of the game.

The left, and those fighting for 

a popular vote system, constantly 
argue that all experiences matter 
and that diversity is a strong aspect 
of American society. I agree. Yet 
they fail to recognize that the 
Electoral College supports diverse 
experiences. This type of system 
allows for people in states with 
smaller populations like Wyoming 
or North Dakota to have the 

same impact as those who live in 
New York or California. While I 
obviously recognize that people 
in New York, for example, all have 
different 
experiences, 
people 

in farming states are 
probably going to care 
about different issues 
than those who live 
in major cities. The 
separation 
between 

the urban and rural 
populaces, the different 
priorities they have and 
the different lifestyles 
they live is good for 
this country.

What 
these 

proponents 
fail 
to 
recognize, 

furthermore, 
is 
that 
if 
we 

transitioned to a system where the 
president was elected by popular 
vote, 
presidential 
campaigns 

would be won and lost in major 
cities. Republicans and candidates 
would need to campaign solely 
in major urban centers, in effect 
ignoring the rest of the population. 
Clinton won the popular vote by 
about 2.5 million votes. If we had 
a popular vote system, she would 
be president. But she would’ve 
been able to do it by ignoring the 
factory workers of Ohio, the union 
workers of Detroit and the Reagan 
Democrats 
in 
Pennsylvania. 

Hillary Clinton would’ve been able 
to win by ignoring the independent 
voters this country prides itself on 
and by focusing on turnout in a 
select few metropolitan cities. Not 
to say that voters in large cities 
are less important, but a popular 
vote system would take away the 
voices and power of those across 
the country — the Electoral 
College, on the contrary, preserves 
everyone’s voice.

What the Electoral College 

protects, and what popular vote 
advocates don’t realize, is the 
voice of the minority. No matter 
the election cycle, our national 
campaigns are always competitive. 
There is always a chance of either 
party winning. In my mind, this is 
a good thing.

Furthermore, I argue that at 

certain times in history, more 
control by one party is good, while 
at other times in history it’s good 
to have competition and minority 
opinions. It’s not good for the 
country if one party completely 

dominates politics for long terms 
in history. The American people 
recognize this, and that’s why it’s 
common for the opposing party 
to win following an eight-year 
president. Tyranny of the majority 
is never good; our founders 
recognized this and implemented 
the Electoral College. No matter 
which side of the political aisle you 
fall on, a system that protects and 
equally weighs all voices is good 
for the United States.

I’ll 
admit 
Republicans 

have gotten lucky with this 
system in both 2000 and in 
2016, and Democrats have felt 
understandably cheated out of 
victory. Yet this is how our system 
is structured. I believe if we look 
past our own biases, we can see 
that this system produces equality 
of impact across the country. We 
truly have diversity of opinions 
and experiences by forcing our 
candidates to pay attention to 
every state, each filled with people 
of unique backgrounds. When 
Republicans have lost, I don’t recall 
the right calling for a complete 
change of our political institutions, 
I don’t remember intolerance. I 
remember a self-reflection and 
improvement of the party, which 
ultimately led to this year’s strong 
victory up and down the ballot.

As college students, we have the 

opportunity and responsibility to 
respect the political institution 
of the Electoral College. Simply 
advocating for its end due to the 
fact that it has historically favored 
one party and the opinion that it 
seems archaic is simply whining. 
This country was never intended 
to be a pure democracy — it was 
meant to be a republic in hopes 
of protecting the will of both the 
majority and minority. Going back, 
looking at the reasons our founders 
advocated for an Electoral College 
and understanding how it has 
shaped our nation in its protection 
of all backgrounds and experiences 
should yield a favorable viewpoint 
of a critical political institution 
of our nation. Clinton won the 
popular vote, but it doesn’t matter 
at all. Trump recognized the rules, 
and won by playing the game as it 
was meant to be played.

I

t’s been a long time coming, 
but I think I’m ready to say 
this: I’m almost officially 

a big boy. Come May, I’ll have 
graduated 
from 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan and be on to 
my next big adventure. 
In many ways, this is a 
cause for celebration: 
I’ll get to subject a 
whole new group of 
“friends” (or, ideally 
if I am accepted into a 
teach abroad program, 
an 
entire 
country) 

to 
my 
antics! 
My 

professors won’t have 
to deal with that annoying kid 
in the front of the class always 
raising his hand like a (insert 
witty comparison). But also, I 
feel a sense of sadness.

My time at this institution will 

soon be over and my learning 
will slow. Obviously, everyone 
is a lifelong learner, but without 
that community surrounding 
me, I fear it won’t feel the same. 
My sister is applying to college 
right now and I’m excited to 
see her embark on her own 
journey through four years of 
moral debasement. Watching 
her weigh the pros and cons 
of different colleges has made 
me wonder: What did I miss by 
going to school here?

I’ve spent much of my time 

looking for a community of 
engaged students on campus 
— people who care not only 
about the issues of our day, 
but also think deeply about 
literary theory and the value of 
art. My freshman year, I joined 
both the Residential College 
and the Honors Program in 
pursuit of like-minded people. 
Orientation boded well for 
me: Honors had us each read 
“Whistling Vivaldi,” a brilliant 
dissection of the psychological 
effects of racism, while the RC 
gave me a collection of poems 
by esteemed poet Pablo Neruda. 
However, when I arrived on 
campus freshman year, I was 
quickly disheartened. 

Rather 
than 
using 
these 

books as part of an ongoing 
yearlong 
conversation, 
the 

two communities held poorly 
mediated, 
all-too-brief 

conversations about the two 
works. 
Then, 
vamoose, 
we 

were set free to the wind. This 
brings me to my first major 
problem with this University: 
Students cover so little of the 
same intellectual ground. I 
accept that this is part of the 
price of attending a massive 

public university, but I still wish 
there was more. One of my close 
friends has often described 
the University as 20 schools 

with one football 
team. 
This 
has 

rung 
increasingly 

true throughout my 
academic career.

My junior year, 

I joined the Ford 
School 
of 
Public 

Policy 
(and 
was 

subsequently 
dragged out of the 
RC 
kicking 
and 

screaming). We had 
two core courses, 

one on policy-making and one 
on economics, which my entire 
cohort was mandated to take. 
I’ve never been more grateful 
for required classes. I had the 
opportunity to understand a 
wide variety of opinions and 
considerations about important 
public policy problems. Like the 
University as a whole, there is a 
distinct lack of a conservative 
presence, but overall I found 
the 
classes 
tremendously 

helpful 
to 
developing 
both 

my own thinking about these 
issues and an understanding 
of how others came to their 
own conclusions. I’m not best 
friends with everyone in Ford, 
but I can hold a conversation 
with anyone there thanks to 
these classes. If I hadn’t been 
accepted 
to 
the 
program, 

I 
would’ve 
floundered 
in 

anonymity in our University’s 
massive Political Science or 
English departments.

This isn’t to admonish either 

of the departments — some of 
the most important growth 
I’ve had occurred in courses 
offered by those departments. 
I’ve spent a lot of time these 
past few months thinking about 
how to develop a personal 
ethos, one of compassion, one 
of morality, one of progress. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that 
these things aren’t really honed 
at this University at large. 
However, I’ve taken a handful 
of courses which have helped 
me develop this ethos. In my 
Art of the Essay course with 
the wonderful John Rubadeau, 
we’ve spent the past semester 
writing 
essays 
about 
our 

personal hardships.

The topics have run the 

gamut from divorced parents to 
career-ending sports injuries 
to 
false 
rape 
accusations. 

During our time together, I’m 
often reminded of American 
poet 
Henry 
Wadsworth 

Longfellow’s quote, “If we 
could read the secret history 
of our enemies, we should find 
in each man’s life sorrow and 
suffering enough to disarm all 
hostility.” I’ve understood how 
painful these experiences are in 
the abstract, but hearing these 
stories in full and attaching a 
face to the story has truly made 
me a more empathetic person. I 
wish other students could get a 
similar experience.

Another key skill I’ve reflected 

upon is how to translate abstract 
concepts from the classroom to 
my personal life. For the past 
year, I’ve studied under Yazier 
Henry, a professor in the Ford 
School who specializes in the 
“political economy of memory, 
trauma, 
identity, 
sustainable 

peace and Truth Commissions” 
alongside 
“how 
structural 

and 
administrative 
violence 

comes 
to 
be 
normalized.” 

Taking courses under him has 
given me the tools to think 
about essential questions on 
what my obligations are to 
disenfranchised people in the 
United States and across the 
world and about how to fix 
institutions which have so often 
failed those people.

However, I’ve also learned 

about how to take the lessons 
learned and apply them to my 
everyday life. It’s inevitable 
that we will all be harmed and 
harm others. Thinking about 
how I can mitigate that harm, 
prevent it in the future and heal 
when I am subjected to it has all 
made me a better person. I’m 
not a perfect person and I still 
have a long way to go but those 
classes have been an important 
stepping stone for me.

No doubt, there have been 

wonderful parts of my time at 
the University. I’ve taken classes 
with 
world-class 
professors, 

made 
lifelong 
friends 
and 

accidentally discovered I want 
to be a writer. But I often feel that 
my growth at this University has 
been institutionally neglected. 
At Harvard, there’s a seminar 
called “Reflecting on Your Life,” 
which teaches students how to 
reflect on personal conflicts in 
their lives and how to get the 
most out of both their college 
experience and time afterward. 
To my knowledge, there’s no 
such class here. That absence 
speaks volumes about what this 
University focuses on.

“For me, it’s glass. I always 

get cut. TV show I just did – 
cut. “Tomorrowland” – cut. 
It’s always getting cut by glass! 
You’re flying through the air, 
doing flips and falling down 
hard and none of that makes any 
difference and then you lean on 
the thing and you’re like, ‘what 
the hell?’ And then you just get 
cut by glass! That’s the worst 
injury.”

It’s 9:22 a.m. in a conference 

room at the Book Cadillac 
Hotel in Detroit, and the room 
is erupting with laughter as 
Keegan-Michael Key explains 
how he most often gets injured 
on set. The Emmy award-
winning comedian and actor, 
perhaps best known for his 
sketch work on “Key and Peele,” 
is in town for Thanksgiving and 
to promote his upcoming film, 
“Why Him?”

The holiday comedy about 

a Midwestern family meeting 
their 
daughter’s 
eccentric, 

Silicon 
Valley 
millionaire 

boyfriend features an all-star 
cast – James Franco, Brian 
Cranston, Zoey Deutch, Megan 
Mullally and of course, Keegan-
Michael Key. It includes stunts, 
accents, literal potty humor and 
a lot of heart. Key describes the 
feature as something “akin to a 
film like, ‘Guess Who’s Coming 
To Dinner?’”

He 
sat 
with 
confidence 

and ease, sipping coffee as 
he explained what led him to 
“Why Him?” After gushing 
about the opportunity to work 
with both the cast and director 
John Hamburg, Key shared 
his personal motivations for 
choosing the film.

“I wanted to do stunts,” he 

said. “If someone says you get to 
play a modern day ‘Kato’ from 
‘The Pink Panther’ — I’m not 
saying no to that. I get to play 
a character, which is what I 
enjoy. Having the strange hair, 
an accent … all of that outside-in 
stuff.”

That he’s doing what he 

enjoys is obvious in the film. 
The sketch comedian is famous 
for his hilarious impressions 
and characters, and he does 
not disappoint in “Why Him?” 
Key plays Gustav, the personal 
concierge of Franco’s character 

Laird. Gustav is “high German 
and educated. Very refined.” His 
accent, quite distinguishable, 
is reflective of Key’s talents. 
Finding the specific dialect for 
the character was a process of 
trial and error, per Key.

“Yeah. I think the first table 

read, I was just like, (Key uses 
an extreme German accent) ‘Hi 
guys!’ and after the table read 
John (the director) says, ‘well 
— that’s a little extreme. Maybe 
he’ll just be German.’”

This kind of role — one 

which allows for collaboration 
between director and actor 
— is where Key thrives. He 
elaborated on the production 
process, 
explaining 
that 

Hamburg 
“would 
let 
us 

improvise quite a lot. It keeps 
the momentum of the movie 
going forward.” The extent to 
which the cast could improvise 
is shocking – one take lasted for 
46 minutes. With the cameras 
continuously 
rolling, 
the 

actors would “keep throwing 
spaghetti at the wall,” he said. 
Clearly it worked – the comedic 
chemistry between actors in 
the film is palpable.

Occasionally, that chemistry 

was 
too 
strong. 
Further 

detailing the 46-minute shoot, 
Key reveals that it was “the 
toilet scene, because we couldn’t 
get through it.” In the film, Key’s 
character Gustav and Bryan 
Cranston’s character Ned share 
an awkward encounter in the 
bathroom.

“There are 46 minutes of 

footage and I’m telling you 
there’s 2 usable minutes. We’d 
be three-quarters of the way 
through the scene and we’d hear 
a boom operator and then we 
would be gone,” Key said.

Ultimately, he said, the only 

possible way for Hamburg to 
make the scene work was “to 
use special effects, cut two 
takes, put them together and use 
CGI in the middle.” Key smiled 
broadly while reminiscing about 
the toilet scene. It seems there’s 
no better exhilaration than 46 
minutes in a bathroom with 
Bryan Cranston.

“It was a lot of fun. How 

often does an African-American 
man get to make a movie where 
he plays a German who know 
martial arts? You have to say yes 
to that kind of role.”

On the note of uncommon 

roles for African Americans, 

Key also discussed the potential 
impact of another upcoming 
film: “Hidden Figures,” about 
African 
American 
women 

mathematicians in NASA. The 
fact that a movie could be made 
about these women, he mused, is 
the “power of cinema.”

“Cinema can evoke emotion 

but cinema teaches,” he said. 
“Especially in this day and age, 
we might need more films which 
show people of an ilk that I 
didn’t know existed. Humans 
that are helping the world, as 
opposed to marginalizing.”

At a pivotal point of his 

career, Key is uniquely qualified 
to examine the potential impact 
that cinema can have. He has 
dedicated his life to the arts, and 
it has paid off insurmountably. 
Reflecting on where he is now, 
he shared what he wishes he had 
known starting out: that process 
is perfection.

“Within yourself, you have 

to figure out what makes you 
happy. There’s not a destination 
called perfection. That way lies 
madness.”

He elaborated further, citing 

recent achievements. “I didn’t 
grow wings and become a 
demigod when Jordan (Peele) 
and I won an Emmy. The only 
thing it means is, now you’ve 
got to do better work! A part 
of me goes, ‘an Emmy! That’s a 
destination!’ No. It’s simply a 
chapter in the book.

“It’s all process. You have to 

be able to find fulfillment in this 
moment. If you can start doing 
that in your twenties, you’re 
just going to have an easier 
life. Otherwise, what are you 
supposed to do? Were you happy 
on the way to the top? That’s the 
part you must cling to. It’s the 
experience,” Key said.

He spoke with peacefulness, 

aware of the journey an artist 
must make yet unafraid of 
the uncertain future. It was 
inspiring to sit across from Key. 
In a span of 15 minutes, he went 
from demonstrating a ridiculous 
German 
accent 
to 
sharing 

wisdom with an eager college 
student.

His final piece of advice on 

navigating life was a perfect 
button 
to 
the 
morning’s 

interview.

“It’s: ‘Wow. Great. Next.’”
“Why Him?” opens nationwide 

on December 23.

LITERATURE NOTEBOOK

I am the biggest bookworm 

and literary advocate you will 
ever meet. Most of my time is 
spent thinking about books, 
perhaps because I am endlessly 
fascinated 
with 
how 
life-

changing a book can be. I am a 
sucker for the classics, and for 
anything published before 1950 
that was written as an attempt 
to inspire social change.

But because so much of my 

mind revolves around books, 
I am incredibly intrigued by 
censorship 
and 
the 
people 

behind it. Is it ignorance? Or is 
it a sheltered lifestyle that leads 
one to want so desperately to 
censor things that human beings 
need to be reading? What do we 
do about it?

A once in a lifetime event. A 

story Fox News and CNN will 
just about kill each other over. 
A dinner party to end all dinner 
parties. Invite only, inside an 
ornate library, catered by the 
Cheesecake Factory. Ladies and 
gentlemen, I present to you: “The 
Great American Controversy: 
Dinner and a Book Ban Debate.” 
Thought you were in for date 
night? Dinner and a show? Boy, 
were you wrong. Welcome, pro-
censorship citizens, to the most 
life-changing dinner of your life.

Just imagine: a long mahogany 

table would be dressed in a 
classy white lace and pearl table 
cloth, surrounded by wooden 
chairs with gold cushions, the 
finest china in front of each 
place. The guest list would be 

exclusive since a dinner party 
of this importance is not just for 
anyone. The list would include 
a specific selection of people 
around the country who have 
attempted to censor books.

And of course, the special 

guests of the evening — all of 
the authors who have been met 
with major protests and bans 
on their incredible works of 
art. Ah yes, these might as well 
be the two favorite pastimes 
of 
the 
overbearing 
parent, 

the 
conservative 
principal 

and the occasionally ignorant 
schoolteacher: attending dinner 
parties and banning books.

Ideally, I’d like the seating 

chart to have Mark Twain sitting 
at the head of the table, where he 
can pass the mashed potatoes to 
a woman from Minnesota who 
claims that her high-school-
aged son and daughter “will 
not be reading ‘The Adventures 
of Huckleberry Finn’ under my 
roof, due to its irrational and 
crude language. The thought 
of having my children read this 
novel is deeply uncomfortable to 
me.”

Mark Twain would turn to 

her with a polite smile and reply, 
“With all due respect ma’am, 
the point of my novel was not 
to make you comfortable in 
any way. In fact, it was meant 
to make you uncomfortable. It 
was meant to uncover the harsh 
realities of the way America 
truly and honestly functioned 
in Mississippi at this time. If 
you are uncomfortable, you 
certainly do not have to read 
my book. But by shielding your 
children from real things that 

happened in this country, you 
are not helping them. You are 
not educating them. You are 
making them ignorant to the 
realities of the world. You are 
hurting them.”

This same woman, we’ll call 

her Sharon, who refuses to let 
her children read phenomenal 
literature because of “crude 
language” will let her son listen 
to whatever terrible music he 
wants when he gets home from 
school. The woman, realizing 
she is wrong, makes a petty 
noise and sips her fine wine, as 
Mark Twain turns to converse 
with Richard Wright.

I’d like Holden Caulfield 

to climb out of the pages of 
“Catcher in the Rye” and pull up 
a chair in between J.D Salinger 
and Harper Lee. In all his 
innocent and naive defiance, 
he would fill his plate with 
only dinner rolls and sit at the 
table adorned in his red hunting 
cap and smile. He would call 
all the people around him 
“phony” as he does so well. He 
would refuse to let his voice be 
silenced. He would continue 
to be a voice for the confused 
and lonely teenager, as he first 
did for the 1960s kids who 
desperately needed something 
to relate to. He would turn to F. 
Scott Fitzgerald who is arguing 
with the priest of a church in a 
town in South Carolina that has 
banned “The Great Gatsby” due 
to references to sex and alcohol.

Dinner and debate on banning books

MUSIC REVIEW

“Brendan, put down the knife 

/ I love you too much to let you 
take your life / and I won’t let 
you try again / won’t let daisies 
grow through your head / won’t 
let daisies grow through your 
skin.”

Slow Burn, the first release 

on Flower Girl Records started 
by 
Old 
Gray’s 

own 
vocalist/

guitarist 
Cam 

Boucher, is an 
unflinching, 
unapologetic 
scream 
at 
the 

world, 
mental 

illness 
and 

death. Old Gray 
have long been 
revered within modern emo, 
and with their latest album, 
they have cemented themselves 
as some of the most talented 
modern musicians with their 
heaviest material to date. It’s 
reflexive of the struggles of 
others and of Boucher himself, 
expressing a chaos only fully 
comprehensible in the emotion 
of music.

The opening three tracks each 

float around a minute in length, 
delivering punishingly abrasive 
instrumentals among screams 
and 
setting 
an 
atmosphere 

of desperate urgency present 
through much of the album. 
The opener, “Pulpit,” effectively 
intertwines screams of suicidal 
thoughts with calm monotones 
contemplating the helplessness 
of attempting to heal. It’s an 
incredibly raw look into the 
cognition 
wrought 
upon 
a 

sufferer of mental illness — a 
tango of anger and surrender to 
your own thoughts.

By the third track, “Blunt 

Trauma,” 
the 
focus 
shifts 

to 
loved 
ones 
who 
have 

succumbed to suicide. “Long 
live the Devil and all hail the 
saints / Chewing up stars with 
their names / Angel, I feel 
your pain / I understand why 
you’d want to take it all away.” 
Instead of the usual emotions 

surrounding social 
views of suicide, 
Boucher expresses 
comprehension, 
even 
longing 
in 

their fate. It’s an 
abrupt viewpoint, 
atypical of most 
music, 
and 
it 

produces 
a 

necessary 
shock 

of eye-opening insight into the 
theme of mental illness.

“Like Blood from a Stone” is 

quite possibly one of the hardest 
songs I have ever listened to 
in my life (yes, I cried three 
separate times), and the first 
half of the song consists only 
of simple monologue, a tale 
of self-harm, hospitalization 
and ultimately the beginnings 
of recovery, before the band 
even adds their overwhelming 
immediacy with shrill notes 
and periods of silence. The level 
of detail produced in these four 
minutes forces itself upon the 
listener, a single story with so 
much feeling it wouldn’t let 
anyone leave unaffected.

Within the track, Boucher 

details an incident with a 
workplace bully before the self-
harm, “And you panic when 
you realize what just happened 

because the boy who picked up 
your notebook, he’s a cruel boy 
/ with eyes like shotguns and 
razor wire.”

He follows this later by 

depicting a befriended patient in 
the hospital: “And there’s a man 
/ maybe ten years older than you, 
with eyes like rough-cut pine 
and sunset.” At the beginning of 
the song, the protagonist writes 
poems of aching solitude, while 
ending with poems of infinite 
possibilities and clear skies, 
alluding to an escape from 
mental confines.

It’s 
this 
symmetry 
of 

opposites that defines Slow Burn 
as an incredible work of art. 
The ending isn’t necessarily the 
standard definition of “closure,” 
but it shows intent to move 
in that direction. It looks to 
improvement and healing in the 
future, even if it isn’t entirely 
attainable at the moment — and 
it lets you know that it’s OK to 
not be completely OK. “Because, 
I don’t want to close my eyes 
anymore / I want to be whole 
again, how the fuck do I get 
there?”

Front 
to 
back, 
the 

comparisons 
throughout 

the album make sense of its 
outward chaos and warring 
emotions, closing with “On 
Earth, as It Is in Heaven,” an 
epic instrumental track that is 
the slowest burn of them all. 
It builds upon itself over the 
course of five minutes, adding 
increasingly 
shrill 
guitars 

and crashing cymbals before 
slowly breathing the album’s 
last breath. Slow Burn is hard to 
listen to because it’s true to its 
name, but it’s as rewarding as 
the progress it paints.

Key talks keys to success

‘Why Him?’ actor gives career and life advice before film premiere

There seems to be a formula 

for the adult party comedy: 
Assemble 
a 
hodgepodge 
of 

stars, throw them into a hastily 
crafted 
context, 
find 
some 

reason for a party and let the 
cameras roll. Plot 
and 
characters 

are rough drafts, 
while the party 
itself 
is 
filmed 

with 
a 
fervent 

meticulousness. 
But, the ultimate 
question remains: 
why?

No 
matter 

the 
output, 

these films keep 
coming, 
and 
it 

doesn’t 
appear 

that “Office Christmas Party,” 
the latest such addition to 
the 
collection 
of 
grown-up 

debauchery, will do anything to 
change that. Unfortunately, the 
film’s rather splendid assembly 
of a cast from various comedic 
walks of life can’t overcome the 
plot which, overloading on a 
variety of stories, leaves the film 
messy, confused and not all that 
funny.

There’s the main story: the 

Chicago branch of Zenotek, 
a 
technology 
company 
of 

sorts, 
isn’t 
performing 
up 

to standards. Clay Vanstone 
(T.J. Miller, “Silicon Valley”) 
runs 
the 
branch, 
sharply 

departing from the no-nonsense 
leadership style of his sister, 
Carol (Jennifer Aniston, “We’re 
the 
Millers”), 
the 
interim 

CEO after their father passed. 

Their sibling rivalry plays out 
over company politics, and the 
Chicago branch is under threat 
of closure.

Clay recruits fellow branch 

executive Josh Parker (Jason 
Bateman, “Zootopia”) and head 
of technology Tracey (Olivia 
Munn, “The Newsroom”) to 
throw a raging Christmas party 

to 
convince 
a 

potential 
client, 

Walter 
Davis 

(Courtney 
B. 

Vance, 
“The 

People v. O. J. 
Simpson”), 
to 

choose 
Zenotek 

as his company’s 
provider. Davis’s 
company’s 
business 
would 

keep the Chicago 
branch 
afloat, 

making good on 

Clay’s bullish promise to give 
everyone at the branch a bonus.

And so the event begins, with 

extravagant fixtures stuffing 
the office with the imagery of 
Christmas, or something like 
it: an eggnog ice luge, a real 
life Nativity scene, plenty of 
lights, and Clay donned in his 
father’s Santa suit. But the 
film spends much of its time 
between coworkers, mingling 
awkwardly, drinking lightly — 
then very, very heavily — amid 
their mundane offices. Allison 
(Vanessa 
Bayer, 
“Saturday 

Night Live”) and Fred (Randall 
Park, “Fresh Off the Boat”) 
have an awkward attempt at 
a sexual encounter, Joel from 
Accounting (Sam Richardson, 
“Veep”) breaks out as a DJ with 
a penchant for air horn sounds 
and Mary, the all-too-common 

pent-up 
HR 
director 
(Kate 

McKinnon, 
“Ghostbusters”), 

tries to maintain her office’s 
sacrosanctity.

But given enough time, and 

certainly enough alcohol and 
drugs, everyone can break loose. 
And so does the story; taking a 
wild turn from a party to action 
sequence, with Clay leaving his 
office party for a hangout with 
a hilariously psychopathic pimp 
(Jillian Bell, “22 Jump Street”), 
who’s only aiming for his money. 
Excluding the risks from drugs, 
seven people nearly die, two 
couples are created (on-screen, 
at least), multiple orgies seem 
to take place, Kate McKinnon is 
at her Kate McKinnon-est and 
Zenotek ruins, and then saves, 
Chicago’s Internet. All in under 
two hours!

But while “Office Christmas 

Party” has a surplus of stories 
and characters, each lacks the 
fine quality needed to make 
the film memorable. There are 
a number of jokes that nearly 
land well, but as I write this 
sentence, about one hour since 
the credits rolled, I cannot 
recall a single one. There 
are few things sadder than a 
completely forgettable film but 
“Office Christmas Party” seems 
to be it, not quite a waste of time 
but certainly a waste of money.

For those short on time, 

revisiting your thoughts on 
“Sisters” or “Horrible Bosses” 
or “Neighbors” can form a 
personalized 
and 
concise 

review of this newer version, 
updated for 2016-relevant jokes. 
“Office Christmas Party” will 
please lovers of these films, but 
detractors will feel distant and 
equally disappointed.

What’s most revealing about 

“Manchester by the Sea” is 
that 
once 
one 

adjusts 
to 
the 

perfection of the 
performances, the 
stunningly human 
characters 
and 

the way the script 
unfolds both the 
turns of its story 
and the psyche 
of its lead, it’s an 
incredibly funny 
movie. There are 
tears and somber 
scenes 
galore, 

and 
the 
movie 

itself 
is 
by 
no 

means a comedy, 
but there is also 
laughter. That laughter reveals 
the 
film’s 
genius. 
Writer-

director 
Kenneth 
Lonergan 

(“You Can Count on Me”) uses 
“Manchester by the Sea” to 
hold a mirror to life and reveal 
that, even in its darkest times, 
there are moments of levity. 
The result is an achingly real 
portrait of grief and family, a 
true masterpiece.

The 
film 
centers 
around 

Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck, 
“Gone Baby Gone”), who must 
return to his hometown of 
Manchester after the death 
of his brother. To call Affleck 
good in the role would be 
the 
greatest 
understatement 

of the year. He is absolutely 
captivating. Everything, down 
to his sideways glances and 
beats of silence, adds up to his 
most 
towering 
performance 

so 
far. 
Michelle 
Williams 

(“Shutter Island”) plays Lee’s 
ex-wife, 
Randi, 
and 
while 

Williams is only given about 
ten minutes of screen time, 
she uses it to deliver one of the 

most emotionally 
devastating 
monologues 
in 

recent 
memory, 

in arguably the 
best scene of the 
film.

The focus of 

“Manchester 
by 

the Sea” isn’t on 
Lee and Randi, 
though; 
it’s 
on 

Lee and his young 
nephew, Patrick 
(Lucas 
Hedges, 

“Moonrise 
Kingdom”). 
The 

scenes 
between 

Hedges 
and 

Affleck are the most dynamic 
of the movie, and it’s from them 
that the movie draws most of its 
humor and heart. Whether the 
two are sniping at each other 
or helping each other navigate 
their way through their shared 
grief, there is a full-formed 
relationship on display that is all 
too rarely seen represented on 
screen. The chemistry between 
the two actors aids in this as 
their characters struggle for 
the possibility of recapturing a 
bond that hasn’t been there in 
years but which both need more 
than ever.

Lonergan’s 
structure 
and 

script does as much character-
building 
as 
his 
performers 

do. He opts for a flashback-
heavy structure which, in the 
moment, 
emulates 
human 

memory. As a result, the viewer 

doesn’t so much feel like they’re 
being clued in to some piece of a 
larger puzzle every time they’re 
treated to a different time in 
Lee’s life. Instead, it feels like 
a step in the natural evolution 
of 
the 
character, 
another 

representation of the past he 
can’t let go.

In the same way, “Manchester 

by the Sea” doesn’t build to 
a typical Hollywood climax. 
There’s no gigantic blow-out 
fight between Patrick and Lee 
that forces them to confront 
their 
situation. 
There’s 
no 

breakdown where one of the 
two confesses his feelings in 
exact terms. Neither of these 
things is realistic, and in a 
movie that strives for realism 
in its depiction of coping, they 
would feel out of place. Instead, 
Lonergan chooses to end the film 
quietly, with the viewer able to 
infer what he or she might from 
the closing scenes. It’s uniquely 
satisfying and poignant, and 
a sign of Lonergan’s immense 
directorial maturity and faith 
in his audience.

“Manchester by the Sea” 

understands grief and sorrow 
in a way that few movies do. 
Its depiction of two people 
struggling 
to 
cope 
with 

changing 
situations 
that 

threaten to upend their lives 
is 
at 
once 
heartbreaking 

and heartwarming, and it’s 
more than likely that two 
people will come out of the 
movie 
with 
two 
different 

interpretations. 
What’s 
for 

certain is this: with his newest 
film, Kenneth Lonergan has 
created a masterwork, a true 
representation of life in all its 
pain and laughter.

TV REVIEW

It’s a normal afternoon on your 

couch. You settle in, prepared 
for 75 minutes of mindless 
Netflix binging — 
and then “Captive” 
begins. 
The 
new 

documentary series 
chronicles 
eight 

different 
hostage 

crises 
worldwide, 

with 
startlingly 

believable 
reenactments 
and 

testimonies 
from 

both hostages and 
their 
perpetrators. 

The series tells a 
different story each 
episode.

Episode 
one, 
“Lucasville, 

USA,” focuses on the 1993 
Southern 
Ohio 
Correctional 

Facility riot. The 11-day riot 
resulted in 10 fatalities and over 
$40 million worth of damage to 
the facility. Today, the prison is 
still operating, and some of its 
death row inmates are leaders of 
the fateful riot 25 years prior.

The episode is captivating, 

from the first 30 seconds to the 
final minute. Viewers are drawn 
in from the opening, which 
features chilling footage of the 
prison post-riot. A swastika 
spray painted on the blood-
spattered wall, a pile-up of dead 
bodies and hallways scattered 
with mattresses and trash — 
more than enough to make a 
viewer sit up in his or her seat 

and wonder what, oh what, they 
have just gotten themselves into.

Told 
chronologically, 
the 

episode starts with the opening 
of Lucasville’s Southern Ohio 
Correctional Facility in 1972. 
The prison was expected to be 

a “state of the 
art” facility for 
roughly 
1,600 

inmates. 
By 

1993, 
however, 

as often happens 
with 
the 

criminal justice 
system, 
the 

prison fell prey 
to overcrowding 
and 
extreme 

regulation. 
It 

was 
regulation 

that, 
in 
part, 

caused the riot. 

A 
state-ordered 
tuberculosis 

test for all inmates caused a 
stir among the Muslim African-
American prisoners. On Easter 
Sunday, they took back the 
prison and all Hell broke loose.

Netflix 
has 
a 
unique 

opportunity with this “true 
crime” 
documentary 
series. 

“Lucasville, USA” in particular 
is a gripping feature on not only 
what occurs in a hostage crisis, 
but also what causes these 
events to occur. The prisoners 
didn’t intend for the situation to 
escalate as it did. But these men 
— hardened by the system — were 
angry, and the riot provided a 
way for them to fight back. To 
quote one inmate: “I’m locked in 
here, but still I’m a human being. 
Still I’m a man. Ya’ll get to say, 

fuck me. No — fuck ya’ll!”

In posing a profile of the 

culprits, 
“Lucasville, 
USA” 

offers a glimpse into the criminal 
justice system: The prison guards 
faced 
with 
impossible 
jobs, 

policing “the most dangerous 
institution in the state of Ohio,” 
the inmates itching to stand up 
for themselves in the place that 
strips them of all semblance of 
humanity. After hearing the 
testimonies of the inmates, it’s 
a wonder that the riot didn’t 
happen sooner.

An 
interesting 
part 
of 

“Lucasville, USA” is that the 
episode 
remains 
objective 

— neither in the favor of the 
criminals nor the victim. It 
simply exists to tell the story as 
it happened. The reenactments, 
mixed with storytelling from 
those actually present at the 
scene, gives the documentary 
a real-time effect. It’s easy for 
viewers to forget that they’re 
following 
a 
crisis 
which 

occurred 25 years ago. In fact, 
this episode feels immediate, 
real and terrifying.

It’s also rich with emotion 

and suspense. If the intention 
of “Captive” is to tell hostage 
stories as if they are fictional 
thrillers, then it has succeeded. 
Though the episodes have no 
connection to each other, the 
thematic elements and unique 
storytelling invoke a desire to 
binge the series anyway. When 
one hostage crisis ends, another 
begins. With “Captive,” Netflix 
invites viewers on a journey — 
and it’s a worthwhile ride.

New Netflix series ‘Captive’ takes its 
viewers on a true crime adventure

Pilot episode looks at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility Riot

We weren’t there, but we know 

what it was like. In the studio, 
they were all there 
— Jermaine Cole, 
his boys, but also 
Cole, mostly Cole, 
yes, 
subtly 
Cole, 

perpetuating 
the 

vibe, 
facilitating 

synergetic creative 
genius. You know, 
the “process.”

Thanks to “Eyez,” 

the documentary released this 
past week in anticipation of 4 
Your Eyez Only’s Dec. 9 release, 
fans were able to see the workings 
behind his latest project. Most 
of its 40 minutes of footage 
is spent on studio going-ons, 
portraying events that, while 
clearly foundational, primarily 
show off a whole lot of nothing. 
Appropriately.

Ingrained in any subjective 

review of any kind is the urgent 
necessity to judge the art and 
not the artist. The thing is, with 
Cole, it’s impossible to categorize 
the two as separate entities. His 
sensitive brand manifests itself 
in his music; his being is one of 
vulnerability. He’s just a kid from 
Fayetteville, North Carolina, one 
with a “dollar and a dream,” and 
it got him to this point.

It is at this point that we 

realize, also, that J. Cole knows 
who 
Ernest 
Hemingway 
is. 

This 
is 
now 
clear, 
because 

Hemingway’s 1940 novel “For 
Whom the Bell Tolls” serves as 
the namesake for the leadoff 
track from 4 Your Eyez Only. Such 
an allusion is initially captivating, 
but soon feels recycled, revealing 
itself as a trend that’s becoming 
quintessentially 
Cole 
— 

stretching to provide depth, only 
to be undermined by a unique 
lack of originality, reverting to 
something, uh, merely digestible 
on the surface.

Thus springs life’s frustrations 

with Cole — caveats about his 
increasingly purgatorial presence. 
In other words, Cole lives a 
perennial existence of almosts. In 
this case, he’s almost Pusha T on 
his defiant, authority-chastising 
“Immortal;” he’s almost Drake 
(or, for that matter, Bryson 
Tiller, whose identical beat on 
“Exchange” has become a source 

of contention among respective 
producers) on ambient “Deja 
Vu”; he’s almost Lupe Fiasco on 
deceptively soulful “Change.”

Emulation 
and 
adaptation 

can be great, except when it’s 

executed poorly. 
Instead, 
Cole 

continues to carve 
his own stake — 
a 
niche, 
albeit 

a 
niche 
that’s 

increasingly, 
inherently 
vanilla. 4 Your 
Eyez 
further 

solidifies 
Cole’s 

occupation of an unnecessary 
and arguably uninteresting space 
in the genre. This shouldn’t be a 
black hole.

Ambiguity 
as 
a 
thematic 

foundation is something that has 
proven equally effective and rare. 
Most reasonably defined in this 
arena by androgynous dress and 
culturally unfamiliar inflection, 
Andre 3000 ostensibly paved 
the way for this breed of wild, 
and artists like Young Thug have 
helped maintain it.

J. Cole wouldn’t immediately 

seem to fit in this trajectory and 
certainly not even close to such an 
extreme. Yet he seems at his best 
when he blurs the lines, in this 
case playing with the perspective 
of the album. A chilling interlude 
interrupts “Ville Mentality” in 
which a young girl mentions her 
dead father and how she didn’t 
attend his funeral. Echoes of 
“Catch me, don’t you” float over 
“She’s Mine Pt. 1” and “She’s Mine 
Pt. 2,” the former about a love 
interest and the latter presumably 
about a new baby.

Considering this thread, the 

question becomes, whose love 
interest is it? And what about the 
baby? Is it Cole’s or his deceased 
friend’s? Could he be talking 
about himself and his buddy? 
Untangling 
his 
unadulterated 

emotional web is what provides 
the album with its most genuine 
moments.

“Neighbors” 
helps 
segue 

between the two aforementioned 
tracks with its own reality check: 
“Some things you can’t escape; 
death, taxes, and a ra- / -cist 
society that make every ni**a feel 
like a candidate / For a Trayvon 
kinda fate, even when your crib 
sit on a lake / Even when your 
plaques hang on a wall / Even 
when the president jam your 

tape.” It gives 4 Your Eyez its 
most convincing moment, yet 
in peak Cole fashion; seesawing 
his vocals and harkening back to 
more earnest, anxious days à la 
Cole World’s “Lost Ones.” Once 
again we’re left to wonder whose 
mouth we’re really hearing this 
from. It’s a stronger look, one that 
leaves us wanting more of this 
dynamic.

Much of this frustration stems 

not from a lack of development 
but from an underwhelming 
progression. Quite simply, Cole 
has plateaued. Cole World was 
fun; at face value, it was a mostly 
careless ode to chasing women 
and soaking in an unfamiliar, 
better life while also building on 
his three previous mixtapes. Born 
Sinner was a new look, a decidedly 
brooding (“It’s way darker this 
time”) 
power 
proclamation 

featuring arguably his best bars 
to date.

And then came 2014 Forest 

Hills Drive. Beyond the endless 
aggrandizing of the “J. Cole 
went double platinum with no 
features” 
narrative/“memery”/

buffoonery were some of Cole’s 
best experimentations yet; “St. 
Tropez” and “G.O.M.D.” gifted us 
with fresh (fresh! J. Cole!) sounds 
we hadn’t yet heard. But now?

There’s an uneasy curiosity: 

where to next? Rumors persist 
of a collab with Kendrick Lamar, 
which at this point feels closer 
on the life-things spectrum to a 
close friend undergoing a godsent 
out-of-body enlightenment than 
a mere What a Time to be Alive-
esque fuck-around project.

Such sentiment, then, explains 

how we ended up here, in 
December 2016, with concert-
long-pensive-stool-percher 
J. 

Cole 
forcing 
a 
development 

forward but ultimately taking 
a step back. 4 Your Eyez Only 
finds Cole working at potentially 
effective themes — criminality, 
injustice, lost ones, loved ones 
and newfound responsibility — 
and employing a stale, years-old 
formula to convey them.

What results is a project in 

which a track titled “Foldin 
Clothes” cannot fully channel its 
metaphorically flimsy essentials 
(i.e. “It’s the simple things”), 
instead rendering said simple 
things too simple. For now, it 
really does seem like J. Cole is 
content to (metaphorically) fold 
clothes for us.

Michigan to face Central Arkansas 

Unfortunately for the Michigan 

men’s basketball team, a reprieve 
from Ann Arbor weather was one 
of few positives 
that came from 
their voyage to 
Los Angeles, as 
the Wolverines 
fell, 
102-84, 

against 
UCLA 

at 
Pauley 

Pavillion 
on 

Saturday.

The 
first 

half 
was 
an 

encouraging 
sign 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
as 
they 
shot 

65.5 percent from the field and 
buried 12 of their 16 3-pointers 
to keep pace with the Bruins’ 
potent offense despite entering the 
matchup averaging just 70 points 
per game.

Specifically, senior wing Zak 

Irvin returned to form — leading 
Michigan with 18 points on 7-for-
14 shooting after scoring just four 
points against Texas.

But after starting the second 

half with the game tied at 50, 
nearly everything that could have 
gone wrong for the Wolverines 
did. Michigan followed up its 
eye-popping first-half shooting 
performance by going 10-for-29 
from the field, and its defense had 
no answer for a UCLA offense 
spearheaded by freshmen Lonzo 
Ball and TJ Leaf. As sophomore 
forward Moritz Wagner described 
it, “Every time I turned around, 
the ball was in the net.”

“Against the Power Five teams 

that we’ve played — we’ve played 
six of them right now — at the end 
of halves and the end of games …
where we were pretty good end 
of half, end of games in the first 
two, it has not been good,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “…
We’ve been coming out of a media 

timeout sometimes, or you were 
just put in the game, and you’re 
standing there watching.

“We’ve got to do something to 

increase our processing speed. 
With everybody, it’s a little bit 
different, so we’ve got to rep it 
out better, we’ve got to talk about 
it better, we’ve got to coach it 
better and then they’ve got to do 
it better.”

Now, the Wolverines are set to 

kick off a three-game home stand 
Tuesday against Central Arkansas 
(1-8) before they begin conference 
play with a trip to Iowa on Jan. 1.

The matchup against the Bears 

is part of a familiar trend for 
Michigan this year.

After losing to South Carolina 

and Virginia Tech this season, the 
Wolverines had the opportunity 
to prevent two-game skids with 
contests against less prestigious 
opponents in Mount St. Mary’s 
and Kennesaw State, respectively.

Michigan delivered victories 

in both games, and now it has the 
opportunity to notch its eighth 
win against Central Arkansas. 
Realistically, there is no reason 
it shouldn’t.

Though the Bears have an 

experienced backcourt led by 
junior guard Jordan Howard and 
senior guard Derreck Brooks, 
they have registered only one 
win this season — a 81-76 victory 
against Army.

Central 
Arkansas 
opened 

its season with a 32-point 
loss to Wisconsin, in which it 
allowed forward Nigel Hayes 
and guards Bronson Koenig and 
Zak Showalter to combine for 
40 points.

With that in mind, it appears 

the stage is set for the Wolverines’ 
three-headed attack of Irvin, 
Wagner and senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. to have a field day. The 
trio is averaging 14, 11.8 and 10.5 
points per game, respectively, and 
its unlikely the Bears will be able 
to limit that production for a full 
40 minutes. 

That’s not to say Central 

Arkansas doesn’t have some 
talent of its own. Howard is 
leading the Bears in scoring 
with 17.2 points per game, while 
Brooks is averaging 15.8 points 
himself and cleaning up the glass 
to the tune of a team-high 6.5 
rebounds per game.

Still, assuming that Walton 

and Irvin can handle Central 
Arkansas’ 
backcourt 
on 
the 

defensive end, the Bears won’t 
have many places to look for 
scoring — Mathieu Kamba, their 
third-highest scorer, is barely 
averaging 11 points per game. 
And given redshirt sophomore DJ 
Wilson’s emergence this season, 
it’s hard to imagine Brooks’ 
rebounding presence will alter the 
dynamic of a should-be blowout.

But in a young season that 

has been full of highs and 
lows, replicating the offensive 
performance that the Wolverines 
displayed against UCLA would 
certainly be a welcome sign of 
progress.

“We scored 50 points in one 

half, we scored 53 against Texas 
in a game,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “I think what’s really 
key for us going forward is, where 
is our consistency?

“We’d rather have guys go 

2-for-5 every day … than go for 
1-for-6 and then 5-for-6 and then 
1-for-6 and then 4-for-6. We want 
some consistency there, and that’s 
what we’re trying to establish. We 
really haven’t had it, and we need 
that right now.”

Lavigne earns praise

For most of this season, the 

Michigan hockey team has used 
a rotation of three goaltenders: 
senior Zach Nagelvoort and 
freshmen Jack LaFontaine and 
Hayden Lavigne. But on Nov. 
11, after Lavigne shut out then-
No. 4 Boston University, 4-0, it 
seemed that he was making a 
case as the frontrunner for more 
playing time.

Unfortunately for Lavigne, his 

rise to the top of the depth chart 
was delayed. After coming down 
with an illness, Lavigne was 
forced to miss four games and 
one exhibition, and during that 
stretch, the Wolverines went 1-3.

Friday, the freshman came 

back to the ice against Wisconsin. 
And while the return of its top 
statistical goalie was a welcome 
sight for Michigan (1-3-0 Big 
Ten, 7-8-1 overall), Lavigne’s 
return was a rocky one.

When all was said and done, 

he lasted just two periods, giving 
up six goals on 27 shots.

“I just definitely started to 

get frustrated in the second 
(period),” 
Lavigne 
said. 

“Obviously we got some bad 
bounces, which didn’t help aid 
that at all. And then with the 
net-front presence that they 
were giving, I just kind of got 
frustrated, and I got in my own 
head a little bit.”

Despite Lavigne’s rough start 

Friday, Michigan coach Red 
Berenson decided to stick with 
the freshman for the team’s 
game against Wisconsin on 
Saturday. The call came as a bit 
of a surprise, given the team’s 
tendency to rotate its goalies this 
season, but it ultimately paid off.

Lavigne faced 35 shots on the 

night, allowing only one goal that 
came off an odd-man rush on a 
power play. And though the strong 
performance was a confidence 

booster in itself, the decision from 
Berenson to give him another shot 
had Lavigne feeling good coming 
into the matchup.

“That meant a lot,” Lavigne 

said. “It really shows that they 
have confidence in us. And 
obviously we’ve been rotating 
throughout the year, and we’ve 
all done pretty well. So it meant a 
lot to get that nod again to get in 
Saturday night. It just shows that 
they have trust in you, and that 
they believe that the team has 
trust in you as well.”

Part of Berenson’s decision 

was to give the freshman ample 
opportunity to prove himself after 
sitting out. But beyond that, he felt 
Lavigne gave the Wolverines the 
best chance to win.

“Let’s face it, on paper, he’s 

got our best record,” Berenson 
said after Saturday’s game. “And 
he needed a chance to play, to 
come back and show what he 
can do. I thought he was a little 
rusty last night. He didn’t play a 
poor game, but his team didn’t 
give him a good game. Tonight, 
the team was better, and Hayden 
was better, too.”

Lavigne’s 
strongest 

performance came during the 
second period of Saturday’s 
game. 
Michigan 
took 
five 

penalties in the period, placing 
extra pressure on the freshman 
to be stout in net. While the 
constant action would make 
it hard for some goaltenders 
to stay calm, Lavigne says 
the constant action helps him 
maintain focus.

That 
effort 
is 
especially 

pertinent for all the Wolverines 
right now — the team has a two 
week break for the holidays before 
it returns to action at the Great 
Lakes Invitational on Dec. 29. But 
with its best goaltender healthy 
and seemingly confident as ever, 
Michigan is more equipped to 
rebound from the tough stretch it 
suffered without Lavigne.

WOMEN’S GYMNASTICS
Marinez, McLean 
try out new events 

One year ago, the Michigan 

women’s 
gymnastics 
team 

hosted 
Eastern 
Michigan 

for an exhibition meet. The 
Wolverines 
dropped 
that 

contest to the Eagles, 194.050-
183.350, thanks in part due to 
gymnasts being absent with 
injuries and illness. 

Sunday, with junior Paige 

Zaziski and sophomore Olivia 
Karas out, Michigan seemed in 
danger of a similar result.

But no such issues plagued 

the Wolverines in this year’s 
event. Led by 
junior 
Lauren 

Marinez 
and 

sophomore 
Emma McLean, 
who each took 
on 
two 
new 

events, 
the 

Wolverines 
edged 
Eastern 

Michigan, 
196.200-
194.750.

“You 
see 

people practice and practice 
and practice, but competition is 
different,” said Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki. “Sometimes they’re 
a little better on competition, 
sometimes 
they’re 
more 

nervous and they make silly 
mistakes. It’s like anything else, 
you want to try and practice 
competing, and I think we’ll be 
a lot better when we come out in 
January against Utah.”

Marinez spent 2015 competing 

mostly on the beam. While she 
found success on the beam, 
scoring better than 9.750 five 
times, she spent fall workouts 
putting herself in position to 
participate in more events. Her 
efforts showed Sunday as she 
entered the bars and vault events 
and posted respective scores of 
9.875 and 9.825.

As 
for 
McLean, 
she 

participated in the floor and 
vault events last season. Like 

Marinez, 
McLean 
produced 

strong performances in her 
events. Her best scores were 
9.875 on the floor against 
Nebraska on Jan. 29 and 9.850 in 
the vault at the NCAA Regional 
on Apr. 2, but she was consistent 
throughout the year.

Against the Eagles, McLean 

became an all-around performer 
for Michigan. She had a solid 
debut on the bars, tallying a 
score of 9.825, and continued her 
vault prowess, as she scored an 
impressive 9.925 in that event.

Still, McLean insists that 

there is more for her to do.

“Personally, I just need to 

work 
on 
my 

confidence and 
compete like I 
train,” McLean 
said. “As a team, 
we need to work 
on 
just 
being 

ourselves.”

While Zaziski 

and Karas were 
only 
held 
out 

against Eastern 
Michigan 
for 

precautionary 

reasons and will return soon, 
the depth that Marinez and 
McLean provide with their 
new events will undoubtedly be 
appreciated by the Wolverines.

But Michigan will have to 

wait a while to put its increased 
depth 
into 
practice. 
The 

Wolverines are not scheduled 
to compete again until Jan. 7 at 
Utah. Plocki insisted, though, 
that the time off will not be a 
bad thing.

“The fall tends to be a long 

semester, a lot of hard work, 
a lot of training.” Plocki said. 
“Their bodies need to recover 
a little bit, so having a week 
break at home I think will help 
physically and mentally. And 
I think when they come back 
they’ll be excited and revved up 
and ready to go. I think coming 
back with a fresh body and a 
good, energized attitude will be 
a good thing.”

“As a team, we 
need to work 
on just being 
ourselves.”

Wolverines return home to play
Ohio after extensive road swing

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is finally coming 
home.

The Wolverines (8-3) haven’t 

been back to Crisler Center since 
their 66-41 win 
over 
Western 

Michigan 
on 
Nov. 
21, 

spending 
seven 
games 

on 
the 
road 

since 
then. 

The team will 
face off against 
Ohio (7-0) on 
Tuesday in the 
first of a four-
game 
home 

stretch.

Michigan 

racked up 95.8 points per game 
on 53.8 percent shooting in its 
first four games of the season at 
home. The Wolverines broke the 
century mark in three of them.

“I haven’t really had to talk 

about our scoring much this 
year, when you have three games 
over 100 points,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico after 
Michigan’s third straight 100-
point game on Nov. 18 against 
Howard. “So I think my emphasis 
is on us becoming a better 
defensive team.”

And since then, Michigan has 

definitely risen to the occasion. 
Notably, the Wolverine’s defense 
at home is nothing to scoff at — the 
team has held opponents to 44.8 
points per game on 29.8 percent 
shooting. That effort is led by 
the charge of junior guard Jillian 
Dunston, who has racked up 51 
rebounds in total, and sophomore 
center Hallie Thome, who has 41.

Michigan is coming off a loss 

to No. 10 UCLA, 84-64, after 
dominating San Diego State, 
92-57. As a highlight, senior 
guard Siera Thompson jostled 
her way to her first career double-
double in the Wolverines contest 
with the Aztecs. It was the first 
time since Feb. 14, 2015, that a 

Michigan player has done so.

“I think this was great for us 

to come out here and experience 
a top-level team,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I think we had to learn to 
battle through adversity. I think 
we had to learn to be on the 
road for an extended period of 
time. We talked about it a little 
bit in the huddle, things haven’t 
gone our way. But we got a long 
season ahead of us. And we gotta 
regroup, and we gotta continue to 
battle and continue to fight.”

The fighting might not only 

extend to opposing teams, but to 
family members as well.

This will be the second straight 

game where a Wolverine will face 
her twin. At UCLA, senior guard 
Danielle Williams faced her 
sister, Dominique. Tomorrow, 
Thome will do the same against 
her sister, Hannah.

Though it might be easy to 

pit the fraternal twins together, 
Thome, a starter, might see more 
playing time than Hannah, who 
has just played in two games this 
season for the Bobcats for a total 
of seven minutes.

In 
addition 
to 
Dunston, 

Thome 
and 
Thompson, 

freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick will be a player to 
watch against Ohio. In the past 
11 games, Gondrezick has scored 
in double digits and currently 
leads the team in free-throw 
attempts with 36, is second in 
scoring with an average of 13.1 
points per game and trails only 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
in 3-pointers made with 25. 

“She really gets to the basket,” 

Barnes Arico said. “She gives us 
a different dimension from that 
guard spot, and getting to the 
free throw line 10 times tonight is 
incredible. That’s something that 

we’re definitely going to need 
going forward.”

Michigan 
will 
need 

Gondrezick’s power to end the 
Bobcats’ undefeated season. Ohio 
is averaging 70.4 points per game 
with two athletes, guard Quiera 
Lampkins and forward Jasmine 
Weatherspoon, 
leading 
the 

charge by averaging 19.3 and 10.7, 
respectively.

An Ohio win would boost the 

Bobcats to just their second win 
against the Wolverines in six 
meetings throughout program 
history, and their fourth against 
the current Big Ten.

The 
last 
time 
Michigan 

and Ohio met, the Wolverines 
escaped with a 69-64 win on Dec. 
21, 2007.

This time, Michigan will be 

happy to be back home and eager 
to defend its undefeated record 
on the floor of Crisler Center.

2016 Season Review: Butt tops deep group of tight ends

With the Michigan football team’s 

2016 regular season in the books, the 
Daily looks back at the performance 
of each unit this year and looks 
ahead to the future in 2017. In this 
edition: tight ends.

At this time a year ago, 

Michigan tight end Jake Butt 
announced he would put off the 
NFL Draft and return for his 
senior season. He said he had 
unfinished business. And while 
he didn’t get to finish all of it, he’ll 
still go down as one of the best 
tight ends in program history.

Butt was the clear No. 1 option 

at that position again this season 

for the Wolverines, perhaps an 
even more central figure than 
last year. In 2015, A.J. Williams 
complemented his blocking skills 
with 12 catches for 129 yards. 
This year, the next-most frequent 
target was redshirt freshman 
Tyrone Wheatley Jr., who caught 
two passes for 27 yards. He and 
freshman Devin Asiasi caught their 

first career touchdown passes.

Butt’s production dropped off 

a bit (from 51 catches and 654 
yards to 43 and 518), but for the 
first time, he captured the Mackey 
Award, given to the best tight 
end in the country. He now holds 
Michigan records for receptions 
and receiving yards by a tight end 
with 135 catches and 1,618 yards.

Despite receiving fewer targets, 

the tight ends were still a focal 
point of coach Jim Harbaugh’s 
offense, as usual. Butt lifted the 
offense, in particular, on third 
down, when redshirt sophomore 
quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

looked to him as a safety net to 
move the chains.

HIGH POINT: Butt was fairly 

consistent as a short-yardage option 
all season, but his biggest impact 
came in Week 3 against Colorado, 
when he totaled a season-high 87 
yards on seven catches. That day, 
the Wolverines faced their first 
deficit of the season, trailing by two 
touchdowns after the first quarter, 
and Butt’s presence over the middle 
helped them slowly rally.

Two of Butt’s four touchdowns 

came a week before against Central 

Florida, though Butt also dropped 
two passes in that game, a rarity for 
the sure-handed senior. Another 
memory fans will keep from the 
season about Butt is that he was 
usually the primary option coming 
out of coach Jim Harbaugh’s 
famous “train” formation. After 
Michigan broke the huddle with 
nine players in a straight line under 
center, Butt was often the first 
target over the middle.

Asiasi 
and 
Wheatley’s 

touchdowns, on Sept. 24 against 
Penn State and Oct. 22 against 
Illinois, 
respectively, 
were 

promising signs as well.

LOW POINT: The weakest 

game for the tight ends, and the 
passing game as a whole, came 
on Nov. 19 against Indiana, when 
redshirt junior quarterback John 
O’Korn stepped in for injured 
starter Wilton Speight. That day, 
the Wolverines completed just 
seven passes for a season-low 59 
yards, none of which went to a 
tight end.

Butt’s lowest production of the 

season as an individual came in 
the middle four games of the year, 
during which he caught just 10 

passes for 118 yards, and perhaps 
that was because the Wolverines 
won three blowouts in that span 
and 
faced 
Wisconsin’s 
strong 

defense in the other game. Butt 
reemerged 
down 
the 
stretch, 

opening up the passing game Nov. 
5 against Maryland to the tune of 
five catches for 76 yards.

THE 
FUTURE: 
Just 
like 

at 
wide 
receiver, 
graduation 

losses are leaving the cupboard 
fairly bare from an experience 
standpoint. 
The 
returning 

tight ends — Wheatley, Asiasi, 
freshman 
Sean 
McKeon 
and 

redshirt sophomore Ian Bunting — 
combined for just eight catches for 
61 yards. Freshman Nick Eubanks 
is another name to watch in the 
next couple of years.

Of those players, Bunting seems 

like the best option to become the 
No. 1 receiving option because 
of his size (6-foot-7, 252 lbs.). 
Harbaugh loves to make use of tight 
ends, though, and whoever steps in 
as the starter will have plenty of 
opportunities, considering fifth-
year senior wide receivers Amara 
Darboh and Jehu Chesson are also 
graduating.

Season Review: Defensive Line

With the Michigan football team’s 

2016 regular season in the books, the 
Daily looks back at the performance 
of each unit this year and looks 
ahead to the future in 2017. In this 
edition: defensive line.

Michigan entered the 2016 

season with its fair share of 
question marks. It was unclear 
who would start at quarterback, 
how the linebackers would fare 
and what could be expected from a 
safety corps losing a mainstay.

But one position group that 

left no reason for concern was the 
defensive line. And somehow, the 
unit outperformed expectations.

Starting 
three 
fifth-year 

seniors and one true senior, the 
Wolverines’ defensive line was 
among the nation’s best right from 
the outset. Michigan finished 
fourth nationally in sacks (44) and 
had the second-most sacks per 
game with 3.67. The Wolverines 
were also the national leaders 
in tackles for loss (114) despite 
playing one fewer game than 
both of their nearest challengers, 
Clemson and Penn State.

Senior 
defensive 
end 
Taco 

Charlton was a breakout star, 
leading the team with 8.5 sacks 
and earning considerable NFL 
Draft hype in the process. Starting 
alongside him were fifth-year 
senior 
defensive 
tackles 
Matt 

Godin and Ryan Glasgow and fifth-
year senior defensive end Chris 
Wormley, the latter two of whom 
also have bright NFL futures.

And that was just the starters.
Redshirt junior defensive end 

Chase Winovich, redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst and 
freshman defensive end Rashan 
Gary all had their moments, too. 
They helped the Wolverines wear 
out opposing offensive lines by 
rotating star after star into the 
game, constantly fresh in their 
pursuit of opposing quarterbacks.

HIGH POINT: At the time, 

Michigan’s 49-10 win over Penn 
State on Sept. 24 just seemed like 
a good team dominating a bad 
one. But when the Nittany Lions 
ripped off nine straight wins en 
route to a Big Ten title and Rose 
Bowl berth, it made what the 

Wolverines did against Penn 
State all the more impressive.

Playing against a team that 

finished the season ranked No. 
5, Michigan racked up six sacks 
and 13 tackles for loss in a total 
decimation of James Franklin’s 
team. Hurst and Charlton were the 
stars of the day, totaling three and 
two sacks, respectively.

Really, there were any number 

of games that could have gone 
in this spot. Michigan was so 
consistently good at this position 
that picking just one high was 
difficult. The first three quarters 
against Ohio State, for example, 
were arguably the most impressive 
the unit played all year.

But games have four quarters, so 

a dominating win over one of the 
nation’s top teams gets the nod.

LOW POINT: The Wolverines 

had their fair share of rough games 
against the run — most notably 
Central Florida and Iowa — but it’s 
hard to assign blame between the 
defensive line and the linebackers.

Even Maryland found success 

on the ground when it went to the 
edge, albeit in an effort that saw the 
Terrapins score all of three points, 
but it’s not always easy to discern 
where the flaws were coming from.

So we’ll give this one to the 

Central Florida game, in which 
the Knights netted 275 yards on 
the ground. That is 22.3 more 
than the number of total yards the 
Wolverines defense gave up this 
season, on average.

After the game, Central Florida 

coach Scott Frost declared his 
team had outhit Michigan despite 
a 51-14 loss. Needless to say, no one 
“outhit” the Wolverines’ D-line the 
rest of the way.

THE FUTURE: The curse of 

starting four seniors is that when 
the season ends, you lose four 
seniors.

Fortunately for the Wolverines, 

though, their second string will all 
return, and that unit should still 
be among the best in the Big Ten. 
Hurst, Gary and Winovich are all 
back and should be in contention 
for All-Big Ten honors by year’s end. 
Joining them should be redshirt 
sophomore Bryan Mone, who has 
battled injuries throughout his 
career but has shown flashes of 
dominance in his time on the field.

And while the second-string 

spots will be up for grabs, the 
Wolverines’ starting four should 
be firmly entrenched for another 
exceptional season.
