After 
the 
Graduate 

Employees’ Organization voted 
to accept the University of 
Michigan’s proposal and end 
its strike, Rackham student Bec 
Roldan posted their feelings 
about the offer on TikTok.

“To be frank, it’s a pretty 

s— offer,” Roldan said on the 
popular social media app, where 
they have been posting updates 
about the strike since it began 
Sept. 8.

Roldan said in the TikTok 

that they were frustrated they 
had to accept the University’s 
second proposal — which was 
approved exactly one week after 
the first was rejected — because 
they felt the administration did 
not move enough on issues such 
as COVID-19 testing and anti-
policing. 

But the looming threat of 

the 
University’s 
injunction, 

which 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel filed with the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Circuit 

Court Tuesday in hopes of 
mandating the graduate student 
instructors and graduate student 
staff assistants GEO represents 
to return to work, ultimately 
pushed 
members 
to 
accept 

the proposal, despite feeling it 
did not meet enough of their 
expectations.

“Because it was very obviously 

a bad offer, there was not a single 
argument that was like, ‘This 
is a good deal, we should take 
it,’” Rackham student Dawn 
Kaczmar said. “All of it was 
weighing the risks of harm that 
would come to us if we didn’t.”

GEO asked for the universal 

right to work remotely, added 
support 
for 
international 

students and diverted police 
funds when it began its strike 
last week. The strike, which had 
virtual and in-person picketing, 
and the union’s demands were 
both shaped and prompted 
by 
the 
ongoing 
COVID-19 

pandemic.

Members of the union say 

they accepted the University’s 
proposal 
begrudgingly 
and 

because they felt like they 
were running out of options. In 
interviews with The Michigan 
Daily, multiple graduate students 
echoed the same sentiment: 
They would not have accepted 
the University’s proposal were 
it not for rising concerns of 
retaliation and an impending 
injunction ruling.

The University of Michigan’s 

Faculty 
Senate 
leadership 

confirmed 
Friday 
that 
the 

faculty’s vote of no confidence 

in University President Mark 
Schlissel 
passed, 
reversing 

course after an earlier ruling 
determined it had failed. 

The passage of the vote 

— 
which 
is 
symbolic 
and 

will 
not 
impact 
Schlissel’s 

employment status — means 
that the Faculty Senate does 
not have faith in the president 

to execute his role as the head 
of 
the 
University. 
Faculty 

Senate members voted on the 
motion of no confidence during 
a virtual meeting Wednesday 
afternoon.

In 
an 
email 
to 
faculty 

members, 
Colleen 
Conway, 

chair of the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs and professor in the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance, announced the vote of 
no confidence in Schlissel had 
actually passed, despite the 
previous announcement that it 
had failed to receive a majority 
of votes.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

James S. Jackson, former 

psychology 
professor 
and 

director of the University of 
Michigan’s Institute for Social 
Research, passed away Sept. 
1 in Ann Arbor after a long 
battle with pancreatic cancer. 
His colleagues, students and 
mentees 
overwhelmingly 

remember 
him 
as 
warm, 

generous and brilliant. 

Jackson was born in 1944 

in 
Inkster, 
Michigan. 
He 

received his bachelor’s degree 
in psychology from Michigan 
State University, a master’s 
degree in psychology at the 
University of Toledo and a 
doctorate in social psychology 
from Wayne State University. 
He retired from the University 
this past year, where he had 
worked since 1971.

Jackson was the Daniel 

Katz 
Distinguished 

University Professor Emeritus 
of Psychology and research 
professor 
emeritus 
at 
the 

Research Center for Group 
Dynamics. He also served as 
the director of the Center for 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies and the director of the 
Institute for Social Research 
from 2005 to 2015, where 

he founded and directed the 
Program 
for 
Research 
on 

Black Americans.

David Lam, current director 

of the Institute for Social 
Research, said on top of being 
a 
trailblazing 
researcher, 

Jackson was charismatic and 
personable. 

“He was a giant in ISR,” 

Lam said. “The PRBA was 
visionary. It was really a very 
pioneering research program 
to study Black Americans. It 
produced many generations 
of Black scholars of Black 
America, health disparities 
and racial discrimination. It 
was very pioneering for its 
time and it’s lasted for over 40 
years.” 

Jackson was a major name 

in the field of survey research. 
He 
created 
the 
National 

Survey of Black Americans in 
1977, the first national cross-
sectional 
survey 
of 
Black 

Americans, 
to 
understand 

the diversity within the Black 
community.

Robert Taylor, School of 

Social Work professor, was 
a student and colleague of 
Jackson’s. He said Jackson’s 
work on the NSBA will be one 
of his enduring legacies.

RYAN LITTLE/Daily

After some confusion, the University of Michigan’s Faculty Senate leadership confirmed the vote of no confidence against U-M President Mark Schlissel passed. 

Students came together to 

mourn a variety of causes on 
Sunday evening: the 200,000 
lost 
to 
COVID-19, 
the 
end 

of 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization’s 
strike 
and 

their loss of faith in University 
leadership. 

A crowd of approximately 50 

undergraduate 
and 
graduate 

students gathered at the Blake 
Transit Center and marched to 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel’s front lawn for a 
candlelit vigil.

Students 
associated 
with 

GEO 
and 
Students 
Demand 

Representation 
organized 
the 

demonstration, which impeded 
traffic from Main Street to State 
Street as the group expressed 
their discontent with Schlissel, 
U-M administrators and local 
police. The group arrived at the 
front lawn of Schlissel’s house, 
where 
several 
students 
and 

organizers spoke and played 
music. 

Rackham 
student 
Lucy 

Peterson, a GEO member who 
helped to organize the vigil, said 
the goal was to commemorate the 
losses of both the organization and 
individuals during the pandemic 
in addition to raising concerns 
about 
the 
administration’s 

reopening. 

“What we wanted to do in GEO 

was mark a moment — the end of 
our strike — and come together 
and be able to reflect with one 
another,” Peterson said. “200,000 
people have died of COVID in 
the United States … We have 
things to mourn: A lot of us have 
known people who have died, and 
the strike in some ways took our 
attention off of that.”

GEO’s 
strike 
ended 
on 

Wednesday when they accepted 
the University’s proposal meeting 
some but not all demands, one 
day after the University filed 
an injunction. Members said 
they would not have accepted 
the University’s proposal had it 
not been for concerns over the 
potential financial impacts of the 
injunction and fears of retaliation.

Students 
Demand 

Representation is a coalition of 
students across the University’s 
three campuses working to get 
student demands heard by upper-
level administrators. The group 
partnered with GEO for a rally 
last weekend.

Peterson also said the vigil 

provided an opportunity for 
those who are discontent with 
the 
University’s 
response 
to 

COVID-19, the GEO strike or any 
other matter to come together in 
solidarity. She said U-M leaders, 
such as Provost Susan Collins and 
LSA Dean Anne Curzan, have 
made decisions that have hurt 
students.

See VIGIL, Page 3


The Graduate Employees’ 

Organization 
found 
broad 

support for their demands 
for greater accommodations 
against 
COVID-19, 
but 
its 

anti-policing demands became 
a 
lightning 
rod 
issue 
for 

those trying to criticize or 
delegitimize the union’s strike. 

Negotiations between the 

University of Michigan and 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization have been at 
the center of conversation on 
campus since GEO announced 
their strike last Monday in 
protest of the University’s 
COVID-19 response. 

Among the demands were 

calls for a “disarmed and 
demilitarized 
workplace,” 

defunding 
the 
Department 

of Public Safety and Security 
by 50% and reallocating the 
funds to “community-based 
justice initiatives,” and for 
the University to cut all ties 
with the Ann Arbor Police 
Department and Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement.

The 
union 
rejected 
an 

initial offer the University 
made last Wednesday which 
did not address the anti-
policing demands. Following 
the GEO’s extension of their 
strike and the University’s 
subsequent action seeking an 
injunction against the union, 
GEO accepted the University’s 
second proposal to end the 
strike last night. 

According 
to 
GEO’s 

statement following the end 
of 
the 
strike, 
the 
second 

offer included a commitment 
from the University to revise 
the 
Michigan 
Ambassadors 

program and create a policing 
task force to evaluate DPSS and 
make recommendations about 
policing. The task force will 
have representation from both 
the GEO and Students of Color 
Liberation Front, which is a 
coalition of the Black Student 
Union, United Asian American 
Organizations, La Casa, Arab 
Student 
Association 
and 

Students Allied for Freedom 
and Education.

Though the University did 

not satisfy the group’s original 
demands, in their statement, 
GEO framed these changes 
as 
“incremental 
but 
real 

movement.”

“Our victories on policing 

in particular came from our 
members’ refusal to abandon 
these demands by accepting a 
first offer with zero progress 
on them, and, importantly, 
from the work of some of our 
Black members to reorient 

around 
and 
win 
strategic 

first 
victories 
in 
a 
long-

term abolitionist organizing 
campaign,” 
the 
statement 

reads. 

GEO 
member 
Emma 

Soberano said she felt the 
University’s 
willingness 

to address policing was an 
important difference between 
the first and second offers.

“In the first case, when we 

chose to continue the strike, 
what I heard was… that the 
University was not willing 
to 
even 
discuss 
policing,” 

Soberano said. “And the fact 
that we got any movement 
at all is really a testament to 
the power of our coalition 
building.”

The 
University 
initially 

made statements implying that 
policing was not under the 
purview of union negotiations. 
In an initial Sept. 9 email 
regarding the work stoppage, 
Provost 
Susan 
Collins 

stressed that GEO could only 
negotiate matters regarding its 
employment. 

“GEO’s strike is based on 

a number of issues, many of 
which are unrelated to the 
wages, hours, and working 
conditions that define their 
employment 
as 
GSIs,” 
the 

email reads. “Issues that are 
not related to the employment 
of its members are not subjects 
that GEO can negotiate with 
the University.”

In 
a 
schoolwide 
email 

sent 
Sept. 
11, 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

wrote 
that 
policing 
issues 

required broader community 
engagement.

“Policing concerns are not 

readily solved through union 
negotiations,” 
Schlissel’s 

email reads.

GEO, 
however, 
argued 

that policing concerns are 
related to their employment 
because of the relationship 
between policing and student 
health. At a press conference 
on 
Wednesday, 
GEO 
Vice 

President 
Erin 
Markiewitz 

spoke to this sentiment.

“Policing, 
even 
when 
it 

does not result in violence, 
negatively affects the health 
of BIPOC and other vulnerable 
populations,” 
Markiewitz 

said. “As it affects the health 
and safety of our members, 
GEO asserts that policing is a 
labor issue and has a place at 
the bargaining table.”

GEO 
member 
Katherine 

White explained the policing 
demands in terms of workplace 
safety.

“The anti-policing demands 

specifically I think addressed 
feelings that Black and Brown 

students had of not feeling safe 
with armed police officers 
around campus,” White said. 
“Safety doesn’t look the same 
for all people, and we should 
be protecting the people who 
don’t feel safe by police.”

Members of the Department 

of Afroamerican and African 
Studies published an op-ed 
Tuesday endorsing the GEO’s 
anti-policing demands.

“We applaud GEO for linking 

their employment demands to 
calls for justice, the protection 
of the health and safety of our 
community and the absolutely 
relevant de-militarization of 
local and campus police,” the 
op-ed reads. 

Similarly, 
in 
an 
op-ed 

published 
Monday, 
faculty 

members from the School of 
Public Health expressed their 
support for GEO, asserting 
that policing is a public health 
issue that can result in harm 
to both physical and mental 
health. The piece specifically 
addresses 
the 
Michigan 

Ambassador program, which 
has 
drawn 
controversy 

resulting in modifications of 
the program by the University. 

Some students questioned 

whether GEO’s initial anti-
policing 
demands 
were 

pragmatic. Engineering senior 
Yilin Yang said while he 
supported the group’s COVID-
19 related demands, he saw the 
policing demands as damaging 
to the group’s platform. 

“I explicitly support GEO’s 

COVID-19 related demands, 
and in my mind, that is by 
far the most important part 
of their platform,” Yang said. 
“The anti-policing demands, 
to me, seem unachievable in a 
purely practical sense. It seems 
to me that GEO is shooting 
itself in the foot by tacking on 
this underthought rider that 
the University can effortlessly 
exploit to discredit the entire 
union-strike movement.”

Yang said his main concern 

with 
the 
anti-policing 

demands was his fear that 
cutting ties with police would 
worsen the spread of COVID-
19 by weakening the Michigan 
Ambassadors’ power to keep 
student gatherings in check.

“It seemed to me like these 

demands 
would 
have 
the 

effect of rendering toothless 
the University’s efforts to 
enforce compliance with local 
and state-level public health 
orders, and that, to me, was 
the biggest red flag that made 
me oppose those particular 
parts of the demands,” Yang 
said. 

Silke-Maria Weineck, chair 

of Comparative Literature and 

professor of German Studies 
and Comparative Literature, 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily that, though 
she 
supports 
GEO, 
police 

reform 
is 
a 
conversation 

requiring 
more 
than 
one 

group’s voice to be heard.

“With 
regard 
to 
the 

COVID 
safety 
demands, 

and by contrast, everybody 
would have benefited from 
enhanced testing and from 
true autonomy with regard 
to face to face teaching,” 
Weineck wrote. “But when it 
comes to policing, I may agree 
with GEO’s take, but I know 
many others do not. So I think 
hashing it out will be a long 
collaborative process — I hope 
the university will let it be a 
truly meaningful one.”

But Ashley Lucas, associate 

professor of Theatre & Drama 
and former director of the 
Creative Prison Arts Project, 
wrote in an email to The Daily 
that she was disappointed 
with the way the strike ended. 

“A new task force is not 

an adequate answer to these 
policing concerns, but given 
that it will exist, I hope that 
university 
leadership 
will 

make sure that a member of the 
Carceral State Project faculty 
working group is appointed to 
the task force so that people 
who actually study policing 
can have some influence in 
the coming decisions,” Lucas 
wrote. “The abolishment of 
the ambassador teams is still 
very much needed, as are the 
disarmament of the campus 
police and the severing of 
ties between campus and city 
police.”

Soberano 
also 
expressed 

some 
frustration 
over 
the 

University’s suggestion of a 
task force to address policing 
concerns. 

“As 
many 
people 
have 

pointed out, task forces are 
used 
by 
universities 
and 

other institutions not only to 
put the labor of solving the 
University’s problems onto its 
Black and Brown students — 
who are the ones hurt by these 
problems existing in the first 
place — but also is used to wrap 
up progress in bureaucratic 
hurdles,” Soberano said. 

“But I think the fact that 

they even allowed us a seat 
at the table is a big step. And 
we had to listen to especially 
the Black students in our 
community who were telling 
us, ‘look, we’re afraid of what 
the University will do to us if 
we continue this strike.’”

Graduate student strike highlights 
policing, public health relationship

GEO’s demands to defund and reallocate funds from law enforcement 
on campus receive mixed responses, spark conversations and debate

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
News
2 — Wednesday, September 23, 2020 

 ALEC COHEN/Daily

The Graduate Employees’ Organization accepted the University of Michigan’s proposal.

ADVERTISING

WMG-contact@umich.edu 


“This time is for us to come 

together and say, ‘Well, the 
University’s cruelty is on full 
display, we gave them every 
opportunity not to be cruel, they 
have every opportunity not to 
be, it’s a choice, in a big way,’” 
Peterson said. “These people have 
real power: President Schlissel 
has real power, Provost Collins 
has real power, Anne Curzan has 
real power, the regents have real 
power. So that all of them pander 
to us by saying they care and then 
make the choice that they did was 
quite devastating.”

Several 
undergraduate 

students attended the vigil to 
express 
their 
disappointment 

with 
the 
administration’s 

handling of COVID-19. 

Engineering 
junior 
Joshua 

Sodicoff said his disillusion began 
in March when students were 
sent home from campus, adding 
that he has since gotten involved 
with an activist coalition that 
works with GEO. 

“Since March, I have been 

incredibly disappointed in the 
University’s response to the 
coronavirus — that started with 
their plan to send everyone 
off campus once they brought 
a whole petri dish of students 
back after spring break, and 
extended as they kicked people 
out of dorms without giving 
them a fair refund,” Sodicoff 
said. “Throughout the whole 
summer, a pretty large coalition 
of groups have been working on 

trying to get their demands from 
the University. Everyone thought 
that there really wouldn’t be that 
many concessions to people’s 
health and safety.” 

LSA junior Trenten Ingell 

said he was displeased with the 
University’s response to the 
GEO’s demands for public health 
and safety, claiming that the 
University’s decision to reopen 
was driven solely by profit. 

“The University has still not 

met a lot of GEO’s demands when 
they canceled the strike, their 
anti-policing demands and even 
a lot of their COVID demands 
were completely rejected,” Ingell 
said. “Their intentions for profit 
have been very clear — how they 
really only understand what 
makes them money, and they 
have no idea how to care for 
people, how to provide a safe 
environment for campus.”

The students at the vigil 

aren’t 
the 
only 
people 
on 

campus with a shortage of trust 
in the University’s leadership. 
Members of the Faculty Senate 
held two votes of no confidence 
in 
the 
administration 
on 

Wednesday, one focused on the 
University’s reopening plan for 
fall semester and the other on 
Schlissel’s role as president. The 
first failed narrowly, while the 
second passed. The symbolic 
measure means faculty members 
do not have faith in Schlissel to 
execute his job as head of the 
University.

“I as Senate Chair, along 

with the Senate Secretary, and 
SACUA have conclusively and 
unanimously determined that 
the University Senate Rules on 
voting using Robert’s Rules of 
Order for interpretation leads 
all of us to the same conclusion. 
Abstentions should not have 
been counted as votes, and 
Motion 6 should have passed,” 
Conway wrote. “We ask for your 
patience and understanding 
while we not only discussed 
how abstentions should be 
handled, but we also discussed 
in depth our concerns about 
the lack of accessibility to 
voting experienced by some of 
our colleagues.”

David 
Potter, 
interim 

secretary 
of 
the 
Faculty 

Senate and professor in LSA, 
confirmed the motion passed 
in an email to The Daily.

Conway said the vote of no 

confidence was the first in the 
University’s history.

When 
asked 
about 
the 

result of the vote, University 
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald 
told The Daily Schlissel had no 
further comment.

At the Wednesday meeting, 

957 members voted in support 
of the motion with 953 voting 
against and 184 abstentions. 
While more people in the 
Faculty Senate said they did 
not trust Schlissel’s leadership 
than those who said they did, 
Potter initially announced that 
the motion had failed because 
it did not receive a majority 
of all votes cast, including 
abstentions. 

More than 2,200 Faculty 

Senate members participated in 
the meeting. The body, which is 
part of the University’s central 
faculty governance system, has 
approximately 4,300 members 
and is made up of professors, 
executive officers and deans, 
among others. 

Potter’s 
ruling 
sparked 

confusion among the faculty 
members. Conway declined to 
announce a decisive result.

Faculty Senate leaders later 

clarified they would need a 
few days to review the matter. 
In an email to The Daily after 
the vote Wednesday, Potter 
said the Faculty Senate Office 
would “speak to the issue” of 
abstentions in a few days.

“As I was counting the votes 

I was seeing four categories, 
three that registered (yes, no 
and abstain) and then that 
there were people present in 
the meeting who elected not to 
participate in the vote, hence 
my statement that motion 6 
was not successful,” Potter 
wrote in the Wednesday email 
about the vote of no confidence 
in Schlissel. “It is possible that, 
after further exploration of the 

issue we will reach a different 
understanding.”

The Faculty Senate’s rules 

do 
not 
explicitly 
answer 

whether abstentions count as 
votes. In this case, the Faculty 
Senate defers to Robert’s Rules 
of Order, a set of guidelines 
for parliamentary procedure 
that date back to the 1800s. 
According to Robert’s Rules, 
the vote of no confidence 
should have passed because 
abstentions do not count as 
votes. 

Among 
other 
claims, 

the vote of no confidence 
accuses Schlissel of ignoring 
scientific evidence regarding 
the risks associated with the 
University’s reopening plans 
for the fall semester. According 
to the resolution, Schlissel did 
not take into account a report 
by the Ethics and Privacy 
Committee when crafting the 
school’s 
reopening 
protocol 

and did not respond to the 
committee’s concerns. 

In a rare move, Schlissel 

addressed members of the 
Faculty Senate at the start of 
the meeting, emphasizing his 
dedication to the University. 
He elaborated on his reasoning 
for allowing some classes to 
be held in person despite most 
being offered online or in 
hybrid formats and discussed 
efforts to expand surveillance 
testing 
of 
asymptomatic 

individuals. 

He 
also 
acknowledged 

concerns 
about 
the 

administration’s 
shortage 

of 
engagement 
with 
the 

community 
and 
lack 
of 

transparency.

“Criticisms and challenges 

are 
qualities 
that 
make 

universities great,” Schlissel 
said. “They also provide an 
opportunity to create solutions 
that 
benefit 
from 
multiple 

perspectives. We can and must 
work together as a university 
to solve problems.”

The 
motion 
also 
states 

that Schlissel fell short in 
his response to allegations 
of sexual misconduct against 
former 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert.

At 
the 
virtual 
meeting 

Wednesday, 
Information 

Professor 
Kentaro 
Toyama 

pointed to the multiple high-
profile 
sexual 
misconduct 

charges 
uncovered 
during 

Schlissel’s tenure, including 
the 
accusations 
against 

Philbert and former Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor 
David Daniels. Both men were 
removed from their positions 
as a result of the allegations. 

Toyama blamed Schlissel’s 

leadership in part for the 
University’s failure to address 
systemic problems and prevent 
institutional failures. 

“Schlissel was the president 

of the University during all of 
these issues,” Toyama said. 

“The buck stops with him, 
and that’s why I’m voting no 
confidence.”

Stephen Ward, an associate 

professor in LSA, submitted 
the no-confidence motion. He 
also criticized the University’s 
response to the COVID-19 
pandemic 
and 
Schlissel’s 

handling of the allegations 
against Philbert.

“The 
president’s 
actions 

and 
inactions, 
particularly 

over the last six months, but 
perhaps over the last six years, 
are setting a precedent that 
we cannot and should abide,” 
Ward said at the meeting 
Wednesday. 

Engineering professor Peter 

Washabaugh spoke in support 
of Schlissel at the meeting.

“I’ve seen this president 

take the correct path, even 
though it might be difficult or 
uncomfortable,” Washabaugh 
said, adding that he believed 
Schlissel had “demonstrated 
thoughtfulness 
and 
caring 

actions.”

At a University Board of 

Regents 
meeting 
Thursday, 

Regent Denise Ilitch (D) read 
a 
unanimous 
statement 
of 

support for the administration 
and the University’s reopening 
plans. She said the board, 
which acts as the University’s 
governing body, knows the 
administration 
needs 
to 

communicate better with the 
broader community.

“Our 
Board 
supports 

President Schlissel and the 
administration as they continue 
to lead our University through 
these tremendous challenges,” 
the statement reads. “We know 
that the president and the 
administration will continue to 
listen and adapt through these 
challenges, honor our common 
values and advance the mission 
of the University.”

In his statement to The 

Daily, Fitzgerald noted the 
results of a sentiment ballot — 
a vote made available to faculty 
members who were unable to 
attend the meeting Wednesday. 

The majority of voters who 

participated in the sentiment 
ballot 
said 
they 
did 
have 

confidence 
in 
Schlissel. 
A 

total of 1,092 faculty voted 
against the measure, while 
942 supported the vote of no 
confidence and 109 abstained.

Before the official vote at 

the meeting Wednesday, Ward 
highlighted what he described 
as a failure of leadership at the 
highest levels of the University, 
particularly 
the 
president’s 

office. 

“He has engaged in evasion, 

misdirection, distortion and 
falsehoods,” Ward said.

“He 
really 
believed 
and 

really pushed the fact that when 
you do research with African 
Americans, it is okay to look 
at in-group analysis,” Taylor 
said. “Before his first major 
survey, we were unable to do 
that. So every comparison was 
between African Americans 
and whites. But when you do 
that, you don’t learn much 
about African Americans.” 

Taylor said Jackson will 

also be remembered for his 
mentorship of students and 
postdocs. Taylor compiled a 
list of dozens of Black students 
and alumni of the PRBA who 
have gone on to become deans, 
chairs 
and 
administrators 

at 
schools 
including 
Yale 

University, the University of 
Chicago and the University of 
California, Berkeley.

In Ann Arbor, nine former 

PRBA students became full 
professors, one became an 
endowed professor and one is 
the chair of the Department 
of Health and Behavior and 
Health 
Education 
at 
the 

School 
of 
Public 
Health. 

Taylor said these lists reflect 
Jackson’s 
commitment 
to 

his students’ success and the 
impact the PRBA had on those 
he mentored.

“He’d 
help 
people 
fill 

their potential,” Taylor said. 
“There’s a lot of people who 
would have left their doctoral 
programs 
if 
they 
hadn’t 

started working with James in 
the PRBA.” 

Cleo 
Caldwell, 
professor 

and chair in the School of 
Public Health, is a former 
student of Jackson’s. She said 
without him, she would never 
have ended up in academia. 
Caldwell recalled that as her 
research 
mentor, 
Jackson 

urged her to gain valuable 
teaching experience despite 
her initial skepticism.

“I said, ‘James, I don’t need 

teaching experience because 
I’m not going into academia,’” 
Caldwell said. “But he looked 
at me and he said, ‘You don’t 
know where you’re going to 
be, so what you need to do is 
to give yourself degrees of 
freedom so you can end up 
doing what it is you want to 
do.’ So for that year I taught, 
wonderful experience, and I 
left, and then I came back to 
academia.”

Jamie Abelson, a senior 

research 
associate 
at 
the 

PRBA, 
said 
Jackson’s 

mentorship style had a ripple 
effect across the academic 
world and created generations 
of 
scholars 
who 
became 

mentors themselves. 

“He was renowned for his 

optimism 
and 
his 
energy, 

which helped propel everyone 
forward,” Abelson said. “And 
not only are all the people who 
ever worked with him grateful 
but 
they 
all 
acknowledge 

that they learned from him 
how to be a better mentor, so 
generations after those (who) 
worked directly with him have 

benefited from him.”

Abelson 
said 
70 
PRBA 

alumni joined a Zoom call the 
night of Sept. 14 to gather and 
remember Jackson’s legacy.

“James was a powerhouse, 

even 
at 
age 
27,” 
Abelson 

said. “One of the renowned 
researchers … was on the call 
and was saying, ‘Picture what 
you were like at 27, or what 
your children were like at 27. 
And just think, that this man 
was doing such important 
stuff at that point.’ He hit the 
ground running.’” 

Angela Dillard, professor 

in 
the 
Department 
of 

Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies and the Residential 
College, 
said 
Jackson 
was 

funny and brilliant. 

“He 
was 
enormously 

generous with his time and 
with advice,” Dillard said. “He 
was a really warm, collegial 
person, and a real role model 
about how to do first-rate 
academic 
scholarship, 
and 

then how to take on these 
administrative and leadership 
roles and really do them well. 
So I know that people say 
things like this when people 
die — they’re like, he’s a great 
person — but he really was 
incredibly warm, really funny, 
terrific smile, and is a kind of 
person who had the ability to 
really put you at ease.”

University President Mark 

Schlissel 
expressed 
his 

condolences for those who 
knew Jackson and noted how 
his research changed the way 
race is studied in the United 

States.

“Condolences to all who 

knew and learned from @
UMich Prof. James Jackson,” 
Schlissel 
wrote 
on 
social 

media. “He was a top scholar, 
leader, mentor, colleague & 
advocate for equity. He made 
our world better and smarter 
with groundbreaking research 
on the influence of race on the 
lives and health of African 
Americans.”

Caldwell said that while it 

would be impossible to list all 
the areas where Jackson made 
an impact, he is remembered 
for his work in fields spanning 
from social science to health 
science to social work.

“He was a giant in aging 

and physical health research, 
research on discrimination 
and social identity, research 
on mental health of Black 
Americans, political studies, 
neighborhood studies –– it’s 
so much, you can’t cover it all,” 
Caldwell said. “But with all of 
that, it was looking at Black 
populations, which allowed us 
to learn a lot.” 

Above all, Taylor remembers 

Jackson for his warmth. 

“One of the things that 

stands out was how warm he 
was to everyone,” Taylor said. 
“Anybody who visited James 
at the PRBA, James Jackson 
was one of the first people 
to come out and greet them 
and say hello. It didn’t matter 
who they were or where they 
were from, he was always very 
warm and very positive and 
very helpful.”

Regarding 
the 
accepted 

proposal, 
GEO 
spokesperson 

Leah Bernardo-Ciddio said the 
end result wasn’t the union’s 
preferred position.

“At this moment, we are all 

feeling a little bit upset and 
frustrated and devastated that 
we were backed into a legal 
corner, and we had to choose 
between our demands and the 
future of our union,” Bernardo-
Ciddio said. “The commitment 
we made last night was to keep 
pushing in other ways while 
making sure our union survives 
and that it can continue to 
protect our most vulnerable 
members.”

However, 
Bernardo-Ciddio 

said the union’s strike did allow 
for more progress on some of 
their key issues than they would 
have made otherwise.

“We did achieve more than we 

would have if we hadn’t gone 
on strike or if we had accepted 
the offer last week,” Bernardo-
Ciddio said.

Under the accepted proposal, 

GEO did not win the universal 
right 
to 
work 
remotely 
or 

partial diversion of funds from 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security, two of their 
major demands. The proposal 
does, however, offer increased 
allocations for child care funding 
and the right to cancel class if 
students refuse to comply with 
the campus-wide mask mandate.

The University also agreed 

to assemble a task force that 
GEO will be involved with 
to evaluate policing at the 
University. The University will 
also create a panel composed of 
a representative from GEO, the 
University and one mutually 
agreed upon person to review 
requests to work remotely.

At the meeting Wednesday, 

1,074 GEO members voted to 
accept the offer, 239 members 
voted to reject and 66 abstained. 
The majority of the GEO steering 
committee supported accepting 
the offer, citing concerns of 
retaliation and the possible 
harm the injunction could cause 
to the union.

The 
University 
sought 
a 

court injunction and temporary 
restraining 
order 
to 
get 

graduate students to resume 
teaching earlier this week. In 
the complaint, the University 
claimed 
it 
has 
suffered 

irreparable injury as a result of 
the strike, including disruption 
of vital functions and a hit to its 
reputation.

The 
University 
requested 

relief against GEO in excess 
of $25,000 for “any and all 
additional 
costs, 
expenses, 

salaries and other economic 
damages 
suffered 
by 
the 

University 
as 
a 
result 
of 

GEO’s breach of the collective 

bargaining agreement.”

University 
spokesperson 

Rick 
Fitzgerald 
said 
the 

University worked with GEO 
to address all of their demands, 
claiming 
GEO 
membership’s 

overwhelming 
acceptance 
of 

the second proposal is proof 
that it was widely considered a 
fair offer. Fitzgerald also said 
the University never threatened 
criminal action or monetary 
damages against individuals.

“The whole point of this — 

the whole negotiations and all 
throughout — the University’s 
commitment was to getting 
GSIs back in the classroom,” 
Fitzgerald 
said. 
“We 
were 

able to accomplish that by 
listening 
carefully, 
I 
think, 

and responding appropriately 
to almost every issue that was 
raised by GEO.”

Because GEO members voted 

to accept the new proposal, 
the University said it will not 
retaliate against the union or 
individual students. Had the 
proposal 
been 
rejected 
and 

the court decided against the 
graduate students, GEO would 
be held in contempt of court, 
meaning GEO would be required 
to call for an end to the strike and 
any members still participating 
could 
potentially 
face 
fines 

of $250 per day of additional 
striking or arrests.

The decision to accept the 

plan came down to if the union 
could afford to keep picketing 
amid the injunction, Rackham 
student Ryan Glauser said. One 
of his main concerns was GEO’s 
ability to fight an injunction, 
which raised the possibility that 
the union could be financially 
drained if the court sided with 
the University.

“The Graduate Employees’ 

Organization is more important 
as an institution than winning 
small things in the short term,” 
Glauser said. “Once we lose our 
union, the University is going 
to take those small things from 
us, because they don’t have our 
trust.”

GEO’s strike gained traction 

on social media, which the union 
used as a way to circulate their 
message. The union presented 
the strike as a way to make 
everyone on campus safer, both 
in terms of protection from the 
coronavirus and from policing, 
as a national reckoning about 
racial justice surfaced following 
the death of George Floyd.

The strike served as a catalyst 

for other groups on campus. 
More than 100 resident advisers 
went on strike Sept. 9 — the 
day after GEO announced its 
strike — to demand additional 
personal protective equipment, 
enforcement of public health 
policies and hazard pay. Dozens 
of MDining student employees 
organized a work slowdown 
for two hours on Friday, with 
plans for a potential strike in the 

future. A hundred theatre and 
drama students signed a letter 
saying they would not attend 
class until School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance leadership 
agree 
to 
their 
demands 

regarding pandemic procedures.

GEO received a litany of 

support from different corners 
of 
campus, 
including 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, labor unions whose 
members were commissioned to 
work on construction projects 
on campus and some faculty 
members. 
Central 
Student 

Government, the largest student 
government at the University, 
encouraged students to stand 
in solidarity with GEO and not 
attend classes for the duration of 
the strike.

Members said they went into 

the meeting Wednesday night 
excited and anxious to see what 
the University had offered the 
second time around. They said 
they felt like awareness and 
support of the strike was rising 
and that the University would 
feel greater pressure to meet 
their demands as a result.

But as the new proposal came 

to light at Wednesday’s meeting, 
Rackham 
student 
Katherine 

Wright said she realized the 
University 
had 
not 
made 

significant changes to what they 
proposed a week prior. The vote 
to accept the proposal, according 
to Rackham student Caitlin 
Posillico, was a result of “serious 
threats, not serious wins.”

Wright, Posillico and other 

members 
agreed 
that 
the 

University’s injunction became 
a game-changer for members. 
They 
described 
strong-arm 

tactics used by the University 
to corner them into accepting a 
plan they didn’t feel adequately 
addressed their demands.

“I realized that the University 

wasn’t going to budge on issues 
that we needed them to budge 
on, and that if we continued, 
we would be potentially putting 
ourselves in danger and our 
union in danger,” Wright said. 
“It just didn’t seem like that was 
the best course of action, given 
that there are other ways that 
we could push them to do the 
work that would be less risky for 
the union.”

Ultimately, Wright said she 

felt resignation upon hearing 
the offer from the University, 
but she also felt pride. She, 
and other GEO members, said 
they felt like they used their 
power to hold the University 
accountable and ensure a safe 
environment for all members of 
the community.

While there was a divide as to 

whether GEO should continue 
the strike, members agree that 
this proposal isn’t the end.

Solomon Rajput decided to 

put medical school on hold in 
September 2019 and run for 
U.S. 
Congress 
in 
Michigan’s 

12th district against incumbent 
Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich. After losing the primary 
election in August, Rajput went 
back to medical school and started 
Done Waiting, an organization 
working to get other progressive 
candidates elected. 

“That night of the election and 

the day after we were thinking, 
‘You know what, we found a 
really cool model here,’” Rajput 
said. “For progressive campaigns 
like ours, the only way that we 
can possibly compete with the 
establishment is through people 
power. We can’t out-raise the 
establishment. … And they’ve got 
all this name recognition, so how 
can we possibly compete? Well, 
we can compete with the power of 
people.”

Done Waiting’s website lists 27 

progressive causes the organization 
is prioritizing, including the Green 
New Deal and Medicare for All. 
They plan to endorse and offer 
support and resources to various 
progressive candidates, both in 
primary and general elections, 
across the country. Currently, the 
only candidate the organization 
has endorsed is Adam Christensen, 

a progressive running in the 
general election for Florida’s 3rd 
congressional district.

In the Aug. 4 primary election, 

Dingell received more than 70% 
of the vote. Though Dingell was 
initially elected in 2014, she, her 
late husband and his father have 
collectively 
held 
a 
Michigan 

congressional seat for almost 87 
years.

Alex Dumont, communications 

director for Done Waiting and 
LSA sophomore, began working 
for Rajput during the campaign. 
He said it can be difficult for 
new progressive candidates to 
run against more established 
candidates like Dingell. 

“When running for Congress, 

it’s really hard to come out of 
nowhere and run right away,” 
Dumont 
said. 
“That’s 
what 

Solomon did and, of course, that’s 
the only way to do it. … So, I think 
we all knew what we were getting 
into in the campaign. We realized 
the uphill battle ahead of us, but we 
really thought it was important to 
do it anyways.” 

Despite the election outcome, 

Rajput said he is still proud of many 
parts of his campaign. 

“Although we didn’t win, we 

won the hearts of 25,000 voters 
across the district. I’m just really 
proud of that,” Rajput said. 
“We created one of the biggest 
campaigns in the country, to our 
knowledge, in terms of manpower. 

I think that we’re actually the 
biggest in the entire country for 
a primary challenger. We hit a 
couple hundred interns and fellows 
from across the country spending 
eight to 15 hours every single week 
working on our campaign.”

Going into the primary, Dingell 

had received more than $1.14 
million in total contributions, 
with over $495,000 cash on hand, 
while Rajput’s total contributions 
amounted to around $116,000. He 
reported a little less than $40,000 
in cash on hand, according to 
documents filed with the Federal 
Election Commission.

Done Waiting has pledged 

not to take any corporate money. 
According to their website, if a 
candidate they have endorsed 
supports a “corporate” Democrat 
over a more progressive opponent, 
they will publicly rescind their 
endorsement and may mobilize 
against 
the 
candidate 
they 

previously endorsed. 

Nick Schuler, vice chair of the 

University’s chapter of College 
Republicans and LSA sophomore, 
said he disagrees with the policies 
supported by Rajput and Done 
Waiting. However, he said support 
for candidates outside of the 
traditional party establishment 
is beneficial, whether in the 
Democratic or Republican parties. 

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents held their 
first 
meeting 
of 
the 
fall 

semester Thursday afternoon 
over Zoom amid the turmoil 
over the reopening plan and 
following 
a 
recent 
Faculty 

Senate vote of no confidence 
in University President Mark 
Schlissel.

The meeting began with 

remarks from Schlissel, who 
addressed 
the 
WilmerHale 

report published in response 
to allegations of misconduct 
made against former Provost 
Martin Philbert.

Schlissel said misconduct 

reports 
of 
senior 

administration officials will be 
directed to the executive vice 
president and chief financial 
officer instead of the provost, 
and the University’s policy 
on consensual relationships 
will be updated as well. These 
policy changes comply with 
recommendations 
in 
the 

WilmerHale report and are 
designed to avoid a situation 
such as the one where Philbert 
was tasked with overseeing 
the department charged with 
investigating him. 

“This change removed the 

possibility of a conflict or 
hesitancy in reporting due 
to our Office of Institutional 
Equity 
being 
overseen 
by 

the Provost,” Schlissel said. 
“It 
follows 
WilmerHale’s 

recommendations 
that 
we 

follow alternative oversight for 
sexual misconduct allegations 
involving 
members 
of 
the 

Provost’s 
Office, 
which 
is 

ordinarily 
responsible 
for 

overseeing 
the 
Office 
of 

Institutional Equity.”

Provost Susan Collins then 

addressed what she referred to 
as “false statements” regarding 
the agreement the University 
reached with the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization on 
Wednesday after more than a 
week of striking. Collins stated 
the University never pursued 
criminal or monetary action 
against grad students. In its 
court filing, the University 
did threaten to pursue these 
actions if GEO continued its 
strike.

University Regent Denise 

Ilitch (D) read a statement of 
support for the administration 
and the University’s reopening 
plans on behalf of the board. 
She said the board knows 
the 
University 
needs 
to 

communicate better with the 
broader community, but they 
are committed to improving.

During the Central Student 

Government 
report, 
CSG 

President Amanda Kaplan, an 
LSA senior, addressed the Big 
Ten Conference’s Wednesday 
vote to restart the football 
season. Kaplan said CSG was 
unhappy with the recently 
announced plan to play this 
fall.

“We want to express our 

deep 
disappointment 
upon 

learning that we voted to 
reinstate 
college 
football,” 

Kaplan said. “Personally, I 
am a huge football fan. But 
as Student Body President, I 
know that this symbolically 
signaled 
to 
our 
campus 

community that ‘we are doing 
fine.’ A sentiment which will, 
without a doubt, enable larger 
student parties on the cusp of 
Halloween, already one of the 
most notorious party weekends 
at Michigan.”

Kaplan also addressed the 

inequity some students feel 
with 
athletes 
being 
given 

priority for COVID-19 testing. 

“With the backdrop of all 

of the advocacy on campus, 
it also signals a profound 
favoritism to athletes who will 
be getting safety testing over 
GSIs, R.A.s, DPEs (Diversity 
Peer Educators), and other 
University 
Employees 
who 

have been fighting to be getting 
any testing at all,” Kaplan said. 

Schlissel commented on the 

testing for student athletes, 
saying it is provided by the Big 
Ten and will not “affect our 
campus testing capacity.”

Public 
Health 
professor 

Emily Martin then shared a 
presentation about the COVID-
19 
Sampling 
and 
Tracking 

Program and announced a 
partnership with the Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 
and 

Prevention and the Department 
of Health and Human Services. 
Martin said the University 
had 
previously 
worked 
on 

widespread influenza tracing 
before COVID-19 and they used 
the skills from that program to 
work on the new surveillance 

program.

“It’s possible that everything 

we’re doing to prevent COVID 
could also prevent influenza,” 
Martin said. “That would be a 
great situation, but I think we 
need to prepare for the next 
phase of the pandemic.”

During the U-M Flint campus 

report, 
Flint 
Chancellor 

Debasish 
Dutta 
expressed 

his satisfaction that the Flint 
campus will participate in 
a pilot to bring telehealth 
services 
to 
its 
residential 

students in conjunction with 
University 
Health 
Services. 

The pilot would also bring 
Student Legal Services to Flint 
for the first time.

“We heard from our students 

as well as our faculty that 
student health services and 
student legal services need 
to be made available to U of 
M-Flint students,” Dutta said. 
“...We are able to provide a pilot 
at this point in time in the fall 
semester to give the telehealth 
services to our students in 
residence halls. We will work 
and see how best to make it 
available to all students next 
year… We are (also) pleased to 
report that all students at U 
of M-Flint now have access to 
Student Legal Services.”

The 
One 
University 

Campaign 
and 
others 
had 

previously 
engaged 
in 
a 

campaign for these services to 
be extended to the U-M Flint 
and U-M Dearborn campuses. 
In a press release about the 
pilot program, the campaign 
expressed excitement at the 
addition of health services, 
while 
urging 
the 
campus 

to extend a program to its 
non-resident 
students 
as 

well. 
The 
statement 
and 

several 
commenters 
also 

demonstrated 
frustration 

with the board and Dearborn 
Chancellor Domenico Grasso 
for not implementing a similar 
program there.

During the public comment 

portion of the meeting, 15 
community 
members 
spoke 

to 
the 
board, 
addressing 

issues including testing on 
campus, the fall opening plan, 
divestment from fossil fuels 
and the GEO strike.

The seasons are changing 

on the University of Michigan 
campus, but many fall staples 
aren’t on the calendar this 
year.

Events 
that 
usually 

characterize a fall at the 
University have been put on 
hold due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, leaving students 
feeling less social compared 
to previous fall semesters.

LSA senior Raquel Powers, 

who is on the cross country 
and track teams, said her 
team couldn’t continue the 
usual traditions that marked 
each fall, such as their annual 
camping trip in northern 
Michigan. 
These 
events 

usually 
allowed 
the 
new 

freshmen on the team to bond 
with the other teammates, 
she said. 

“(The 
freshmen) 
don’t 

know what the normal is yet, 
and they don’t know what the 
team traditions are and that 
we could be closer than how 
we actually are right now,” 
Powers said. “All the previous 
years, especially with the 
camp, we get to know our 
teammates very well. But this 
year we just have practice 
and then everyone just goes 
and does their own thing.”

Powers 
said 
other 

restrictions, 
such 
as 

maximum capacities in the 
training room and locker 
rooms, 
also 
affect 
social 

interactions with her team. 

“Like the pre- and post-

work that you used to do in 
the training room and locker 
room, where you’d really 
chit-chat with your friends 
and chit-chat with the trainer 
as you get treatment, you just 
don’t get that time anymore 
with the people you used to,” 
Powers said. 

Rackham student Holden 

Greene 
said 
he 
enjoyed 

playing 
intramural 
sports 

in his previous years at the 
University, even refereeing 
for flag football. Without 
sports this fall, he said his 
days felt a lot less engaging. 

“Like 
every 
Monday 

or every Wednesday, you 
(would) have that sport to 
look forward to playing and 
it’s an otherwise nice break 
from classwork or especially 
if you were having a slow 
day,” Greene said. “In some 
ways, my days (now) feel 
more regimental, like, I do 
this one thing and then I go 
to sleep. It feels like every day 
is the same routine.”

LSA senior Lauren Croxton 

said not being able to draw 
her energy from pre-planned 
events such as football games 
or her business fraternity’s 
events 
makes 
being 
on 

campus for her last year feel 

very different. Though Big 
Ten has since announced 
the return of football, no 
fans will be allowed in the 
stadium. 

“I know the way I drive a 

lot of my own happiness is 
being able to look forward 
to events like that,” Croxton 
said. “I need to start making 
that happen for myself again. 
Like I need to set up events 
that I can look forward to on 
my own because there’s no 
one organizing that for me 
anymore.”

Social life at the University 

has 
also 
been 
shaped 

by 
Washtenaw 
County 

guidelines, 
which 
limit 

outdoor 
gatherings 
to 
a 

maximum 
of 
25 
people, 

including 
those 
in 
off-

campus houses. Fraternities 
and sororities have agreed 
not to host social events this 
semester.

Engineering 
senior 

Josh 
Goldstein 
said 
he 

was excited about football 
season and to go to bars like 
Rick’s American Cafe and 
Scorekeepers 
Sports 
Grill 

and Pub. But even if the bars 
open, he said they won’t feel 
the same.

Goldstein 
is 
glad 
he 

can 
at 
least 
spend 
time 

with his friends in small 
groups, 
though 
it 
affects 

his relationship with other 
friends he’s not as close with. 

“I am upset about that, but 

I’m also happy to be here,” 
Goldstein 
said. 
“And 
it’s 

nice to not be stuck at home. 
It’s nice to be able to be on 
campus and still see people 
I know … you get really close 
with the people you live with, 
but a con is you probably get 
a little less closer with your 
best friends and the circle 
gets a little smaller, which for 
some people, could be a good 
thing.”

Music, Theatre & Dance 

sophomore Kliment Milanov 
said 
he 
and 
his 
friends 

usually supplemented their 
music education experience 
by performing in gigs and 
theatrical 
performances. 

However, 
with 
COVID-19, 

many of his usual gigs no 
longer take place.

“It sucks because I don’t 

feel like I’m getting a great 
performance 
education,” 

Milanov said. “There’s just 
no more ability for (gigs) in 
terms of employment and 
performance, and that’s just 
something we’re not getting 
trained in and not getting 
experienced in.”

Croxton, who still lives 

with some of the girls she 
met and joined a business 
fraternity with her freshman 
year, said she understands 
how difficult this year must 
be for freshmen, who are still 

new to the campus and trying 
to make friends and be a part 
of organizations. 

“I think that every part 

of my life (now), while it 
looks very different today 
than it did freshman year, 
in some way, goes back to 
some connection or some 
experience I had freshman 
year,” Croxton said.

LSA 
freshman 
Shruti 

Swaminathan 
said 
she 

expected 
more 
socially-

distanced activities to be put 
on by the University when 
she first moved into Mary 
Markley 
Residence 
Hall. 

Making friends has been 
difficult given COVID-19’s 
impact on social life, she said.

“When 
I 
came 
onto 

campus, there weren’t many 
activities planned for us, and 
everyone was just on their 
own about how to spend their 
first 
week,” 
Swaminathan 

said. “I think making friends 
is going to be really different 
from 
past 
years 
… 
But 

everyone is on the same boat, 
so it makes it a little more 
easy and comforting.”

Students 
living 
off 

campus have had to start 
new 
conversations 
among 

roommates 
about 
their 

expectations for each other.

Croxton said she and her 

housemates held a meeting to 
come to an agreement on how 
they would keep each other 
and their community safe 
during COVID-19. She said 
this plays a role in missing 
out on time with other groups 
of friends.

“Obviously the future is 

very dynamic and changing 
so we didn’t put any long-
term rules in place,” Croxton 
said. “I think a lot of other 
houses 
have 
had 
similar 

discussions so people are 
definitely sticking with the 
people inside their house 
… So you may miss out on 
friends and being involved in 
those activities you normally 
would have gone to.”

Goldstein said he and his 

housemates had a similar 
discussion. Some off-campus 
houses may have roommates 
with 
varying 
levels 
of 

reactions to the virus, he 
said. 

“I think it would be a lot 

different if you live with 
some people who take it very 
seriously and some people 
who don’t take it seriously 
at all,” Goldstein said. “It’s 
also hard to keep track of 
how other people are being 
precautionary so it’s hard to 
tell who would be down to see 
people and who wouldn’t.”

COVID-19 reported at Brown Jug as semester began

The Brown Jug, a popular 

student restaurant and bar on 
South University Avenue, has 
reported at least six positive 
COVID-19 cases among staff since 
late August. 

A server, who requested to 

remain anonymous due to fear of 
retaliation from their employer, 
told The Daily six employees 
tested positive for COVID-19 in 
the past month. Both the server 
and the restaurant’s owner, Perry 
Porikos, confirmed these cases. 
The entire staff was then tested 
for COVID-19 — those tests came 
back negative.

The Brown Jug then shut down 

from Aug. 30 to Sept. 8 after a 
cluster of cases emerged among 
employees on Aug. 28, according 
to Porikos. He said he immediately 
contacted the Washtenaw County 
Department of Health and shut 
down the restaurant for deep 
cleaning on Aug. 30. He also told 
all employees who tested positive 
to quarantine, following health 

department protocol.

“I decided for the benefit 

of everybody to shut it down,” 
Porikos said. “You know, informed 
the health department right away. 
They informed me that, listen, 
legally, (you don’t have to) shut 
down.” 

However, the server said the 

restaurant did not close while the 
employees were awaiting results 
from their tests between Aug. 20 
and Aug. 30. 

“The problem is, with this 

testing … when (management) says 
‘OK, everyone has to get tested,’ 
you don’t close, everyone still 
comes into work, even if they’re 
waiting on test results,” the server 
said. 

Nate, a bar manager who asked 

to only use his first name for 
privacy concerns, said he was the 
first to get a positive result back 
for COVID-19 on Aug. 25 after 
going in for a test four days earlier. 
He said he felt sick the day before 
and took off from work, and then 
got tested. 

“The earliest (positive case) 

was actually mine,” Nate said. “I 

was like, ‘I’m not gonna come in 
for a shift, I don’t feel right, I felt 
weird.’ So I actually didn’t come in. 
I tested positive on the 21. I wasn’t 
even in contact with anybody. I got 
it from an outside person.” 

Nate said another employee 

later tested positive who, days 
earlier, had tested negative. The 
employee had worked nearly every 
shift in between the test days, so 
the entire staff got tested again, 
Nate said. From that group, four 
more came back positive. 

“One of the workers was 

asymptomatic the whole time, but 
that person was working almost 
every shift,” Nate said. “Everyone 
got scheduled to get tested, and 
the second person that came back 
positive, we were like, well, the 
rest of you are probably going to 
test positive as well. It was only 
five of us altogether that got it, and 
that’s when we shut everything 
down.”

Nate said he believes The 

Brown Jug is doing everything it 
can to protect its staff and patrons 
from COVID-19. 

“We’ve been cleaning, self-

quarantining, getting checked,” 
Nate said. “I mean, there’s not 
much more we can do. Everything 
is 
sanitized 
after 
touching 

everything, capacity is limited. 
We had a line outside the other 
day and it was aimed away from 
our patio. And we can only control 
people as much as we can control 

people.” 

The server said all employees 

were told to wear masks at all 
times and usually left tables open 
to maintain social distancing and 
wiped down menus and tabletops 
with a bleach solution.

However, 
the 
server 
said 

employees did not always follow 

these precautions. On weekend 
nights and during other peak 
hours, employees did not have 
time to clean menus or enforce 
social-distancing limits, they said.

MaryAnn Sarosi, an attorney 

in Washtenaw County, sat at 
her desk one day in early April, 
combing through court files 
while preparing for a case. She 
eventually stumbled across data 
that caught her eye: criminal 
court 
cases 
revealing 
vast 

racial disparities in Washtenaw 
County’s legal system.

She said the task at hand 

— sifting through data to get 
statistics on racial inequities 
— seemed daunting at first, 
but nationwide revolts against 
police 
brutality 
reinforced 

her commitment to seeing it 
through.

“We lamented for a long 

time that these things weren’t 
transparent,” Sarosi said. “And 
then I realized, well, they are on 
the court records, on the court 
website. It would be tedious, 
but we could do these by hand, 
and we started doing by hand. 
And then after George Floyd 
was murdered, we realized, 
‘Oh, we really got to do this. We 
really got to do this on a broader 
scale.’”

The numbers Sarosi found 

reveal large gaps in the treatment 
of different racial groups in 
the county’s criminal justice 
system. According to a report 
documenting 
her 
findings, 

prosecutors charge people of 
color more often than they do 
white people. The extent of the 
disparities 
varies 
depending 

on the felony category. For the 
felony category of suspended 
license, 
prosecutors 
charged 

people of color 22 percent more 
than white people. For the 
category of “Weapons - Felony 
Firearm,” people of color were 
charged 1,150 percent more often 
than white people, meaning POC 
faced charges at a rate 12.5 times 
that of their white counterparts. 

In 10 of the 11 categories, 

prosecutors filed more charges 
against people of color, on 
average, than white people, 
ranging from a 12.8 percent to 
62.9 percent difference. People 
of color also received more 
convictions per case, on average, 
than white people in 10 of the 11 
categories. 

The report was a team effort. 

After initially combing through 
the files with her colleague 
Rev. 
Joe 
Summers, 
Sarosi 

teamed up with Linda Rexer, 
retired 
executive 
director 

of the Michigan State Bar 
Foundation and Alma Wheeler-
Smith, former representative 
in the Michigan State House 
of 
Representatives, 
to 
form 

Citizens for Racial Equality 
in Washtenaw — a group that 
collects and analyzes felony case 
records from the county court’s 
website to explore whether and 
to what extent racial disparities 
exist in the county’s charging 
and sentencing practices. 

In 
August 
2020, 
CREW 

published the report online 
detailing their findings after 
scraping through thousands of 
cases on the court’s website. 
The analysis covers more than 
3,600 court cases in 11 felony 
categories — including capital 
and non-capital felonies — from 
2013 to 2019. 

According 
to 
the 
report, 

Washtenaw County prosecutors 
have 
broad 
discretion 
in 

deciding whether or not to 
charge someone with a crime 
and what kind of charges to 
bring. 

Washtenaw County judges 

also have wide volition in 
determining the length of a 
sentence and choosing whether 
to accept a plea agreement or to 
sentence a person to probation, 
jail or prison. 

“While 
we 
found 
racial 

disparities 
among 
individual 

judges, CREW did not find that 
the Washtenaw County Circuit 
Court, as a whole, demonstrated 
a pattern of racial disparity in 
its sentencing of our community 
members across all eight case 
categories 
we 
studied,” 
the 

report read. “That is not to say, 
however, we found no instances 
of disparity across the court.”

The data showed 44.1 percent 

of people of color convicted of 
homicide were sentenced to life 
in prison, compared to only 27.3 
percent of white defendants. 
Additionally, 
most 
of 
the 

judges “contributed to a wide 
racial disparity in the average 
minimum/maximum 
sentence 

in armed robbery cases.”

The report also highlights 23 

instances in which individual 
judges were found to issue 
harsher sentences or whose 
sentences 
showed 
racial 

disparities. 

Several former University of 

Michigan student-athletes joined 
lawmakers in Lansing, Mich. to 
announce legislation to extend 
the statute of limitations on 
certain sexual abuse cases and 
reform governmental immunity. 
Standing on the steps of the 
Capitol Building, the survivors of 
alleged abuse by late University 
doctor Robert Anderson called for 
systemic change to hold predators 
accountable.

The “Empowering Survivors” 

legislative 
reform 
package 
is 

co-sponsored by state Rep. Ryan 
Berman, R-Commerce Township, 
and state Rep. Karen Whitsett, 
D-Detroit.

Berman 
described 
the 

legislation as a necessary step 
to empower survivors of sexual 
abuse and assault. If passed, the 
two bills would reform Michigan’s 
statute of limitations to create a 
one-year window from the time 
the laws are passed for survivors 
of criminal sexual assault to sue 
if their abuse happened under 
the guise of medical care or if 
the abuser was in a position of 
authority such as a medical doctor. 
The package would also alter the 
state’s governmental immunity 

law to prevent universities from 
mischaracterizing sexual assault 
to avoid lawsuits.

“This type of behavior must be 

stopped, as should the legal tactics 
used to protect these institutions 
from lawsuits when abuse occurs,” 
Berman said. “Our purpose today is 
simple: Survivors must be allowed 
to pursue justice as they see fit. 
It’s my privilege as a legislator and 
citizen to have the opportunity to 
help these people who are sent to 
college as teenagers, our best and 
our brightest, only to be abused 
and ignored. Well, I say, no more.”

The 
allegations 
against 

Anderson 
span 
decades. 
In 

February 2018, former University 
student-athlete Tad DeLuca, who 
participated in the announcement 
Wednesday 
morning, 
accused 

Anderson of sexual misconduct at 
a press conference in Southfield, 
Mich. 
Other 
former 
student-

athletes later came forward with 
their own stories of abuse.

The University has since set up 

a hotline number for survivors and 
sent letters to thousands of former 
student-athletes about the alleged 
sexual misconduct. That effort 
has expanded to include the more 
than 300,000 former students 
who were on campus during 
Anderson’s tenure from the middle 
of the 1960s to the early 2000s. A 
judge ordered the University in 
August to inform those students of 
litigation involving Anderson.

Jon 
Vaughn, 
who 
played 

running back for Michigan in 1989 
and 1990 before spending four 
years in the NFL, said as a student 
he trusted the University would 
give him the best care. Instead, 
he said he was frequently abused 
during medical appointments. 

At the press conference, Vaughn 

said he now has trouble going 
to the doctor or placing trust in 
doctors after what happened 
with Anderson. He called on the 
Michigan state legislature to pass 
the bills to help protect other 
survivors.

“It has also become very clear 

that the University of Michigan 
knew,” Vaughn said. “They made 
a choice not to protect us. Instead, 
the 
University 
enabled 
our 

abuser.”

DeLuca, a former wrestler, 

described the difficulty he has had 
dealing with the alleged abuse he 
endured as a student in the 1970s. 
He added that his coaches knew 
because he wrote them a letter 
in 1975 telling them about his 
experiences with Anderson.

DeLuca said serial predators 

and the people who enable them 
should not be allowed to “run 
out the clock” on the statute of 
limitations to avoid prosecution.

“Serial sexual molesters and 

their 
accomplices 
should 
be 

subject to perpetual overtime,” 
DeLuca said. “Why should an 
institution like the University of 

Michigan be allowed to hide the 
conduct long enough so they can 
hide behind the law and never 
have to answer for the abuse 
they allowed for all these years? 
It makes no sense and it must 
be changed. The University of 
Michigan failed to be the Leaders 
and the Best.”

Dr. John Lott, who played 

football from 1979 to 1983 and 
is now a licensed clinical social 
worker, also spoke. Lott said 
he had to endure exams from 
Anderson every year, which took a 
toll mentally.

Recent testimony revealed a 

former University of Michigan 
vice 
president 
overturned 
a 

decision to fire Anderson in 1979. 
In a court deposition, Thomas 
Easthope, former vice president 
of the Division of Student Life, 
accused former Athletic Director 
Don 
Canham 
of 
ignoring 

allegations against Anderson and 
allowing the doctor to assume an 
influential role in the University 
Athletic Department. The school 
is facing various lawsuits over 
Anderson’s alleged abuse.

Outside law firm WilmerHale 

is 
conducting 
an 
external 

investigation into the allegations 
against Anderson on behalf of the 
University.

The Remarkable 
Brevity of Grief

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan In Color
6 — Wednesday, September 23, 2020 

So it begins. The bass 

drums through me as I move 
my body to the music, my 
eyes closed. Psi U is full of 
bodies, all moving in a haze. 
If I swing my hips too quick-
ly to one side, I find myself 
grazing a hip, but if I miss the 
rhythm, a hand creeps along 
my side. The dance floor is a 
careful game, where if you 
are with the music, you are 
rewarded — by not getting 
body slammed. There are 
rules. Never open your eyes 
or look for too long either, 
but I forgot that momen-
tarily. Beat. Eyes open. Beat. 
Eyes go to the front. Beat. 
I see you. How long has it 
been? A month since the last 
time we’ve seen each other, 
but 
months 
since 
we’ve 

looked at each other in the 
eyes like this. Beat. Another 
beat comes to mind, coming 
straight from my head, the 
music filling the room fades 
in my ears. I begin to hear 
“We Lied to Each Other” 
playing in my head and we 
lock eyes.

The average person lies 

two times a week. That was 
my first lie of the week. In 
reality, 
the 
average 
per-

son lies two times a day. So 
I guess that was my first 
lie of the day. I wonder if 
that includes sustained lies, 
which go on over time. Does 
your lie count go up automat-
ically each passing day, or is 
it just one offense? I thought 
about this whenever I cried 
about my dad, curled up into 
myself and alone. 

My mom and my dad met at 

the University of Michigan, 
where an engineering and 
biology student fell in love 
despite all odds. He was from 
Costa Rica, an international 
student proud of his Leba-
nese roots, who was destined 
to inherit his father’s com-
pany. She was from Ecua-
dor, more or less “fresh off 
the boat,” naturalized three 
years before starting college. 
They came together and, in 
the same breath, fell apart. 
My father wasn’t supposed to 
be with someone not Leba-
nese and definitely was not 
supposed to be with some-
one from Ecuador. It was his 
father’s company or her. My 
father knew that from the 
start. But she didn’t. When 
I grew inside her, he left. I 
stretched her belly, while the 
distance stretched between 
my mother and father, as 
he married the woman he 
left her for. I sometimes 
think about how my mother 
received her new baby as my 
dad received his new wife. If 
my dad did not lie about his 
circumstances, would I be 
here?

Here I was, in my moth-

er’s home country, and I felt 
like an alien. It’s funny how 
people associate you with 
an identity before you claim 
it for yourself. Before I even 
knew what being Hispanic 
was, I was it. There was no 
discovery. Just a comment 
about how I’m a funny wet-
back and here I am. If only 
they had seen me struggle 
to understand my mother’s 
tongue or witnessed how 
much I stuck out from the 
average 
Ecuadorian. 
They 

didn’t see it, but I did. I felt 
so removed from this place, 
and by extension, removed 

from my mom. I would never 
understand what it would be 
like to be truly Ecuadorian, 
to be forced to move to anoth-
er country. But under the 
clear blue water in Ayampe, 
I could exist. With the surf-
board pressed between my 
legs, I felt it all. I savor the 
Ecuadorian 
sun 
pressing 

against my back, the salty 
Ecuadorian water burning 
my eyes and, for a moment, I 
feel Ecuador. Standing pow-
erfully on my surfboard. I 
feel like my mother.

I feel like my mom every 

now and again, but never 
as intensely as I did in this 
moment, standing with you at 
the CCTC. We had been talk-
ing for two months. Every-
thing was falling into place, 
as I began to feel like my 
place was right next to you. 
You, who explained deriva-
tives to me in your “I’m an 
Engineering student” voice. 
Your roommates began to 
feel like mine. Your dorm 
began to feel like mine. You 
were mine, and I was yours. 
When I’m surfing, sometimes 
I can feel the board about to 
slip out from under me the 
moment before it actually 
happens. For a split-second, 
before, I am aware that I 
will fall and the board will 
shoot out from under me. 
We were walking back from 
a date, where you took me 
out to ice cream and poked at 
my cheeks for how messy my 
face got, and I was hit with 
the same feeling. Maybe it 
was the look in your eyes or 
how your pitch changed, but 
I just knew. As you cradled 
my hand in yours, we were 
over as quickly as we started. 

This really is happening, 

huh, at the CCTC?

You 
told 
me 
how 
you 

couldn’t lie to us anymore. 
Your parents wanted you to 
be with another Armenian. 
Not me. Your breath catches 
for a moment. You push out 
the rest, how they’ll stop 
paying for college if you stay 
with me. You held my heart 
in your hands and now it’s 
bleeding. A part of me won-
ders why I’m not yelling at 
you for getting me into this 
mess, for letting me fall 
in love with you when you 
knew it was non-viable. For 
using one of your two lies 
of the day to lie to me about 
what you wanted. I couldn’t 
help but think about what a 
waste this all was. A waste 
of 
time, 
energy, 
vulner-

ability. And then it hit me. 
I was my mom. Is this also 
where my dad ended things 
with her? What did she feel 
like when she heard the very 
same lie? Did she also feel 
like her heart was torn out 
of her chest for someone who 
was unworthy of her love? 
Are we bound to repeat his-
tory over and over again like 
our parents? I laughed at the 
sheer irony, and you looked 
confused. I laughed till my 
stomach ached and the bus 
came to take me back to my 
own dorm. I laughed as you 
turned into a small figure 
and the bus moved farther 
and farther away from you. 
I laughed as I pressed my 
face against the glass, will-
ing myself to look away 
from you. I laughed until my 
breath caught and I thought 
to myself, “Is this what it 
took for me to feel closer to 
my mom?” I laughed until I 
heard my mother’s voice on 
the phone, which brought me 
to my first tear. So it begins.

MiC Columnist

The hospital has a distinct 

smell. A smell I have tried in 
vain to find a worthy com-
parison for, an alternative the 
rest of the world could under-
stand, maybe the smell of gaso-
line, or nail polish, or moldy 
socks, or dirt or a locker room 
that hasn’t been cleaned in 
months. You see, the smell of 
the hospital is so particular, 
so stubborn, that it renders 
itself immune to any attempts 
at description or computation. 
It is a smell that burrows itself 
underneath your fingernails, 
within the strands of your hair, 
the fibers of your clothes, coat-
ing your nerve endings, seep-
ing into the folds of your grey 
matter, so that in time, the hos-
pital no longer becomes syn-
onymous with healing and care 
and new beginnings but rather, 
soley that smell. 

It is the smell of grief, of 

remarkable grief, the kind that 
blurs your vision and boils 
your blood so that it roars in 
your ears, of dirty parents who 
haven’t showered in days, of 
bad news, news so bad it flips 
your world onto its axis, elimi-
nating all that is familiar, all 
that is known; news deliv-
ered by doctors with plastered 
smiles, just the right mix-
ture of synthetic sympathy, a 
twinge of relief perhaps, that 
this is not their life, this is not 
their pain. It is the smell of 

shattered glass, of fatigue, of 
broken dreams, of wishes made 
on shooting stars, of prayers, 
of meals with the consistency 
of cardboard that only man-
aged to get by FDA regulations 
simply because they met nutri-
tional value standards and 
nothing else, the smell of the 
knowledge of the inevitable, of 
death and of the tiniest shred 
of hope.

The timeline of my life is 

divided into B.C. and A.D., 
Before Cancer and After Diag-
nosis. Much like in the years 
leading to the coming of mod-
ern religion, my reality was 
primitive, ruled by kingdoms 
whose lifeblood was fantasy 
and naivete, where constel-
lations 
danced 
and 
leaped 

across the night sky, where 
dragons breathed fire and the 
flick of a wand was a worthy 
opponent to the world’s great-
est problems. Grape popsicles 
that melted within a minute of 
opening, rivulets of violet sick-
ly sweet staining the notches 
in my hands, the lines etched 
in my palms, pooling into the 
valley between my thumb and 
my finger, so that in due time 
corporate America’s idea of 
what artificial grape flavor-
ing should taste like became 
infused within the twists and 
spirals of my DNA. The utter 
and raw simplicity of child-
hood being the only thing that 
could bend the laws of the uni-
verse. In the year of our Lord, 
my anno Domini, in the way 
that worship and faith brought 

advancement, 
progression, 

chaos, and divisions, cancer 
swept through my brother’s 
life and in effect mine with the 
same ferocity. It is an anomaly, 
it creates chinks in the social 
chain, tearing big, gaping holes 
in the already threadbare fab-
ric of your life, and it has no 
mercy; it will gnaw muscle 
right off the bone, it will fray 
heart string, it will pulverise 
connective tissue all without 
discriminating by race, gender, 
religion, socioeconomic status 
or power.

When I was 11 years old, 

my brother, 6, was diagnosed 
with stage 4 Medulloblas-
toma. A tumor in his brain 
no larger than overripe plum 
upended my life. Of course as 
with anything we regret, there 
are so many what-if’s, what if 
we had realized it was a flaw 
in his genetic code, that all 
that needed to be done was to 
switch an A with a T, what if 
we had caught it sooner, that 
his slurred speech and inabil-
ity to walk straight were some-
thing much deeper than viral 
meningitis. For 10 hours, he 
was suspended on the thin line 
between life and death, they 
sawed into his skull, prodded 
within the crevices of his mind 
with cold, foreign instruments 
that had no business being 
there, haphazardly snipping 
nerves and nicking arteries, his 
blood splattered on their shoes, 
smeared across their clothes, 
embedded within the granules 
of their white latex gloves. My 

brother was born again, with 
a crooked face, and eyes that 
were unable to close, and sores 
in his mouth, and arms marred 
with grey residue from medical 
tape, and thick white bandages 
that oozed yellow pulp. So that 
doctors, young doctors with 
an aura of smugness, know-
ing that they were the very 
embodiment of the American 
ideal of success, in the way 
they carried themselves, in the 
way they handled stethoscopes 
with whip smart accuracy, told 
us my brother would never be 
able to read or write again. 

I read in some magazine 

somewhere, a waiting room 
with peeling walls and flick-
ering fluorescent lights, or in 
line at the grocery store, or in 
the school library reading as 
a desperate attempt to mask 
the fact that I had no friends, 
that the sense of smell has 
the longest evolutionary his-
tory out of any of the senses, 
that the body’s sense of smell 
and memory retrieval have 
an instantaneous connection. 
Like how the smell of wax 
crayons and soap remind you 
of the irreproachable purity of 
kindergarten, or how freshly 
cut grass and barbecue invoke 
the sense of summer or how 
the smell of the hospital, still 
so tenacious after all these 
years, reminds you of pain and 
grief and scratchy eyes from 
no sleep, and wilting flowers 
and half deflated helium bal-
loons and sick brothers and sad 
moms and desolate dads.

Twitter has always been my 

social media drug of choice. My 
timeline — essentially Arab twit-
ter, Muslim twitter and Leftist 
twitter, speaks to my personal-
ity and beliefs to a concerningly 
accurate degree. As my relation-
ship with Twitter has adapted 
— what was once a 30 minute 
daily check-in has seamlessly 
transitioned into a pandemic 
ritual of daily two hour blocks 
— I’ve come to the realization 
that Twitter, as well as other 
forms of social media, has had 
an engrossing, personal effect 
on my life, especially within the 
past six months. Remember that 
one week where everyone post-
ed passive aggressive tweets 
followed by a red heart? I used 
the same mannerism in nearly 
every text conversation that fol-
lowed, thinking it was comedic 
gold. In April, when everyone 
was absolutely fascinated by 
bread, specifically of the banana 
variety, I bought multiple bags 
of flour and made banana bread 
at least three times a week. The 
intrusive effect social media has 
had on my psyche and social 
life has intensely heightened 
throughout quarantine. Unfor-
tunately, the same can be said 
for a concerning number of 
young adults. Online, where 
the need to create viral content 
reflects an internalized need 
to feel validated within public 
circles, social media directly 
translates to the urges we have 
as social creatures because of 
its unique ability to gather peo-
ple. The sense of gratification 
when a post gets more likes than 
expected, the second guessing 
we feel before we hit post and 
the tweet in our drafts that will 
never hit our followers timeline, 
all indicate an emotional depen-
dency that technological giants 
have spawned for their users. 
And during the pandemic, that 
addiction has never been stron-
ger.

As how I choose to spend my 

day and how I communicate 
increasingly stem from social 
media 
interactions 
powered 

by consuming algorithms, the 
compelling allure has held me 
and others captive. Amassing 
a sizable following and receiv-
ing likes are parts of a system 
designed to psychologically per-
suade users to utilize these apps, 
each usage followed by immedi-
ate dopamine hits. This potent 
neurotransmitter is responsible 
for making us feel pleasure, and 
in moments filled with height-
ened sadness, consumers are 
desperate to fend off secluded 
sentiments of sadness. This 
has been particularly severe 
among young adults, as Gen-Z’s 
dependence on social media was 
excessive prior to the pandem-
ic, and screen times have only 
elevated during the numerous 
phases of lockdown. Further, 
the CDC has conducted studies 
that have shown that Gen-Z is 
facing the brunt of mental ill-
nesses during the pandemic, 
with one in four young adults, 
aged 18-25, experiencing height-
ened anxiety, depression,and 
suicidal thoughts. The social 
fabric of society is unraveling. 
While that percentage can be 
broken down and expanded 
across a multitude of issues 
such as financial stress, anxi-
ety surrounding health and 
academic pressure, the lack of 
human connection is just one 
more centrally detrimental fac-
tor for the mental psyche of 
young adults across the world. 
In this emptiness, social media 
networks have rooted them-
selves as essential connecting 
points amid daily pursuits for 
companionship while quaran-
tining. Before the pandemic, it 

was clear that Gen-Z, the first 
generation born in the internet 
era, was already facing higher 
numbers of suicidal thoughts, 
feelings of isolation and anxiety 
than generations prior. And the 
pandemic has only exacerbated 
already augmented statistics.

Social media’s ability to offer 

quickly digestible media head-
lines and regulations as the 
world shifted through stages 
of lockdown, left users on the 
application long enough to con-
sume other forms of informa-
tion. Conspiracy theories are 
one example. The United States 
has been politically — and mor-
ally — polarized for some time, 
but social media platforms; 
namely Reddit, Facebook and 
Twitter have stretched out an 
exceedingly thin line in the 
COVID-19 era. False conspir-
acy theories such as QAnon; a 
theory asserting that Donald 
J. Trump is the only one who 
can “save the children” from 
alleged sex traffickers Barack 
Obama and Hilary Clinton, 
have grown exponentially. As 
people struggle to grasp onto 
any idea that seems rational in 
irrational times, Twitter has 
immensely 
furthered 
these 

divides, pushing leftists further 
left, and far-right users further 
into the fringe. According to 
Pew Research, users on Twitter, 
second only to Reddit, are more 
likely to be exposed to conspir-
acy theories. This has serious 
implications as it continues to 
bleed into political discourse, 
and the danger of entrapping 
users in a bubble remains a soci-
etal threat. 

The role social media has had 

in fostering communities based 
on common interests and beliefs 
has also been socially beneficial. 
Social media applications allow 
people to form niches, causing 
users to view strangers as close 
friends, despite never having 
truly interacted with the indi-
viduals off the internet. With 
apps like TikTok dominating 
the airwaves, other platforms 
remain social media power-
houses, wielding influence in 
fostering connections based on 
personal affiliations; whether 
it be a horoscope sign, brand 
or fandom alignment. While 
social media can rightfully be 
analyzed as a dangerous way 
of promoting groupthink, the 
possibility to cultivate a com-
munity with people who share 
your quirks and interests are 
endless. Especially in a socially-
starved society, it manifests as 
a way to feed our aching crav-
ings. If a user can focus their 
time and energy on stan culture, 
analyzing movies or engaging 
in debates online, there is less 
time to stress on truly immedi-
ate issues. This is a severe form 
of escapism, but in a period 
filled with so many unknowns, 
confusion and tension, social 
creatures are looking to escape 
what’s off our screens.

 Despite all the apparent dan-

ger, I can’t help but wonder how 
the platform will become more 
enmeshed in my life and the 
lives of others as the weather 
chills and any small window we 
have to be social outside pushes 
us back into our homes and onto 
digital spaces. This dangerously 
enticing human connection we 
have to mere applications is the 
basis of commentaries like Black 
Mirror, but in a world where our 
social selves are left wanting, 
users, including myself, will 
continue to sacrifice our time, 
energy and personal data for 
a swell of gratification. Time 
has proven that our ravenous 
reliance on social media harms 
our collective consciousness, 
but right now, when the hunger 
for interaction overwhelms our 
fears of a technologically-con-
sumed society, consequences be 
damned.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

This week, the Sun moves into 
Libra at the equinox – a point of 
balance, when light equals dark. 
Mercury is also on the move, 
arriving in Scorpio. Mercury in 

Scorpio can have a dark 
edge, but this energy is 
excellent for research 
and strategic thinking.

AQUARIUS

GEMENI

Feel the joy of the Sun, now 
illuminating the most fun-loving 
and creative part of your chart. 
This is a fantastic week for artistic 
expression or simply for enjoying 

yourself. If you can take 
a vacation, do it! 
Definitely a week to 
remember.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

Give full reign to your naturally 
nurturing instincts, perhaps by 
taking someone lonely under your 
wing. You have a lot of compas-
sion to teach the world, but your 

confidence may be 
lacking. Perhaps you 
could express it 
creatively?

TAURUS

Focus on your physical and mental 
wellbeing this week. You can’t 
serve others if you’re not well 
enough to look after yourself. 
Negotiating with a partner gets 

easier once Mercury 
changes sign, but you 
may still struggle to ask 
for what you need.

This very busy week finds you 
packing in far more than 24 hours 
a day allow – so don’t be 
surprised if you end up exhausted! 
There’s a strong sense of 

satisfaction here though, 
and the progress you 
make will be very 
pleasing indeed.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

The Sun leaves your sign this 
week, and now is a good time to 
focus on your finances. Even 
though you’re not materialistic, 
you appreciate the value of money 

because it provides for 

safety and security – so 
use that as your 
primary motivation.

With the Sun arriving in Libra, 
you’re showcasing all the very best 
of your sign. This is set to be a 
happy, sociable week, and if you’re 
single, it’s a good time for dating. 

Planning works well too, 

with your thought 
processes becoming 
more methodical.

Your natural instinct is to seek 
solitude as the Sun shifts into your 
privacy zone. However, with 
Mercury arriving in your sign, 
you’re actually feeling more 

sociable and chattier than 

normal. Engage with the 

world – new friends are 
waiting.

You feel driven to accomplish 
things for others this week, 
especially in a humanitarian or 
charitable sense. Don’t allow guilt 
over what you have or have not 

done in the past hold you 

back. You know better 

now, and you’re 
doing better.

The Sun shines brightly from your 
career zone now, allowing you to 
step into your full power and 
authority. Mercury brings you 
extra persuasive powers too, so 

it’s likely that whatever 

you say this week will 

be listened to and 
respected.

Your restlessness increases as the 
Sun shifts signs, and there’s an 
underlying need for adventure. If 
you can ring the changes in your 
daily routine, you’ll benefit from 

this. Do something 

different. Stretch your 
mind.

The Sun stirs up deep emotional 
depths within you, but releasing 
these emotions is healthy. Look 
ahead several years and decide 
where you want to go. Don’t 
worry too much about the details 

at this stage – it’s your 
overall vision that’s 
important.

Social Media:
The sweetest poison

Throughout American history, 

the nation’s culture and main-
stream ideologies have under-
gone significant changes, but 
one sentiment that has stood the 
test of time is the concept of the 
American Dream. This dream 
states that we can achieve any-
thing we want if we work hard 
enough. Through this concept, 
society 
has 
been 
convinced 

that, as individuals, our fate is 
completely dictated by our own 
choices. And as a result, we have 
learned to see the actions and 
outcomes of our lives as entirely 
separate from that of other peo-
ple’s, completely disregarding 
the societal and communal fac-
tors that can affect one’s liveli-
hood.

Fast forward to the present 

day, where we are now being 
told about how one individual’s 
cough or breath could start a 
chain reaction of coronavirus 
infections that could eventually 
take someone’s life. Living in the 
midst of a pandemic has proven 
how our lives are interconnected 
with everyone we come into con-
tact with, strangers and loved 
ones alike. In response, many 
public health officials and politi-
cians have been encouraging and 
requiring the country to follow 
guidelines such as wearing masks 
that pass the flame test and social 
distancing. Though these guide-
lines promote the well-being 
of those who follow them, they 
have been primarily regarded 
as actions that are necessary for 
the safety of those we cross paths 
with. The expectation that peo-
ple will see the health of others 
as their responsibility, and con-
tinuously sacrifice for the sake of 
those they don’t know completely 
opposes America’s individualis-
tic value system. With this being 
the case, it is only fair to ask: is 
this country willing to abandon 
its cultural roots in order to pro-
mote the livelihood of its people?

The observable answer is no. 

This has shown to be the case 

in recent weeks, where the start 
of the fall school semester at 
the University of Michigan has 
brought on an influx of large 
gatherings, creating potential 
breeding grounds for COVID 
cases. This result is unsurprising 
considering what we know about 
the nature of the disease. 

“COVID is a very social dis-

ease,” said Gary Harper, a health 
behavior and health education 
professor within the University 
of Michigan’s School of Public 
Health. “It spreads through the 
air. So if you have students who 
are drinking, laughing, and sing-
ing, plus they’re drunk so their 
inhibitions are down, that’s a 
virus’ playground.” 

With the virus’ ability to 

thrive in tightly-packed spaces, 
many have been questioning the 
logic behind people willingly 
and unnecessarily creating situ-
ations that allow this fatal virus 
to spread. The answer could lie 
within our culture.

According to the unwritten 

rules of an individualistic cul-
ture, people are only going to con-
tinuously follow guidelines that 
show visible benefits to them-
selves and their livelihood. Social 
psychologists have attested that 
people 
within 
individualistic 

cultures are more prone to mak-
ing decisions based on individual 
needs, and only feel responsible 
for taking care of themselves and 
their families. This norm makes 
the discrepancy between the 
identities of people participating 
in these large maskless events 
and the communities being over-
whelmingly impacted by COVID-
19 
extremely 
relevant. 
The 

demographics of the gatherings 
in question are mainly young, 
middle to upper-class white uni-
versity students. This population 
of people is known to be the least 
impacted by the dangers of the 
virus . 

Some believe that this causes 

this population to be disconnect-
ed from the reality of the disease. 
“These aren’t the people being 
disproportionately 
impacted 

by the disease,” says Dr. Harp-
er about this disconnect. The 

racial disparities when it comes 
to the impact of COVID have 
been acknowledged at both the 
local level and the national level. 
“When the virus hit Michigan, 
specifically in Detroit, 60% of the 
people who tested positive were 
Black,” continues Harper. In the 
United States overall, Latino 
and African-American residents 
are three times more likely to 
become infected, compared to 
their white neighbors. 

And yet race is not the only 

thing that separates these par-
tiers from the reality of COVID. 
There is also their age to con-
sider. 

“Even when it comes to age, 

the majority of the people who 
are dying from it are older. With 
all of these partiers being young, 
if they catch the virus, they are 
very likely to recover from it,” 
Harper said.

This acts as a further separa-

tion that Dr. Harper summarizes 
with a very telling statement: 
“COVID isn’t real to them.” Yet 
it is very real to many others, 
including people of color, older 
citizens, and lower-income resi-
dents, especially those serving 
in essential worker positions 
that do not provide paid time off 
nor proper personal protective 
equipment.

With the people leading these 

parties on campus being socially 
and 
geographically 
separated 

from the hotspots of the virus, 
as well as the communities most 
affected by it, there is likely to be 
an attitude of either indifference 
or ignorance among the attend-
ees. Many might not believe 
that their actions have tangible 
repercussions, or they may be too 
disconnected from the impact 
to care. With the societally-pro-
moted desire to care only about 
oneself, this leaves many of these 
students without a visible reason 
to care.

Since this is a problem that lies 

within the value system of this 
country, many of the proposed 
solutions are located there too. 
“We must change how we define 
‘community’ in this country,” 
says Dr. Harper. Harper, who 

has done HIV community work 
and research since 1985, and has 
worked extensively in Kenya for 
the past 15 years, looks to the 
collectivism mindset of the East 
African country when proposing 
a solution. 

“In Kenya, there is a very 

collectivist 
mindset,” 
Harper 

said.“They had curfews almost 
immediately. Now they’re kick-
ing COVID’s butt instead of 
COVID-19 kicking their butts. 
There, the mindset is that if one 
person has COVID-19 the whole 
community has COVID. The say-
ing ‘it takes a village’ isn’t just a 
cute saying there. It’s how they 
live.” The mindset that one per-
son getting COVID is equivalent 
to the entire community getting 
COVID is not as far-fetched as 
it may appear. The easy mobil-
ity of infectious disease makes 
the potential of an individual 
case turning into a community 
concern quite possible. Because 
of this, the community-based 
mindset that has been ingrained 
into Kenyan society is what has 
resulted in relatively lower pro-
portions of deaths compared to 
the U.S. Given these outcomes, it 
is very possible that normalizing 
the idea of being a team player - 
as elementary as it sounds - could 
be a saving grace to American.

This may not be easy to do. 

The United States is the same 
country that has allowed its 
individualistic values to pre-
vent it from providing their citi-
zens with universal healthcare. 
The pervading mindset that one 
should not be responsible for 
financially supporting the live-
lihood of a stranger is the rea-
son why millions in this country 
have neglected health needs due 
to economic strain. It is also 
the reason why tax-supported 
healthcare programs like Medic-
aid remain under constant scru-
tiny. The ability of this country to 
redefine its values to encourage a 
lifestyle that considers and cares 
for the national community con-
tinues to be an uphill battle. The 
question of whether the ravaging 
impacts of COVID will change 
that is yet to be determined.

Does American culture make succumbing to COVID-19 inevitable?

Opinion

I

f you’ve been on the Ann Arbor 
campus of the University of 
Michigan between 5 a.m. 

and 5 p.m. this past week, you’ve 
likely heard chants of “Solidarity 
Forever,” 
impassioned 
speeches 

about quarantine conditions and a 
noticeable lack of construction noise. 
If you haven’t figured it out by now, the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization, 
non-unionized resident advisers and 
a host of MDining staff have been 
striking to protest the University’s 
inexcusable mishandling of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. GEO has 
additionally 
emphasized 
the 

deconstruction of the University’s 
relationship with and reliance on 
the Ann Arbor Police Department 
and armed campus police. Simply 
put, these strikes on campus are 
necessary for the collective health 
and safety of the University and Ann 
Arbor as a broader community. On 
Wednesday, Sept. 16, GEO ended the 
strike after accepting an offer from 
the University. However, the broader 
problems of community health 
and systemic injustices still stand 
and ought to be analyzed after the 
historic strike came to an end.

For many at the University, 

U-M’s COVID-19 planning has been 
an utter letdown. Between public 
health experts’ assessments, the 
University’s own ethics committee 
and the general student sentiment, 
the University has dropped the 
ball on any semblance of a “health-
informed” 
fall 
semester. 
This 

fumbling 
of 
critical 
decision-

making and lack of transparency 
has 
had 
widespread 
impacts 

that affect the entire University 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
communities. 

For undergraduates, the lack of 
transparent communication from 
the administration on decision-
making, the absence of randomized 
testing and increased tuition make 
it incredibly hard to navigate the 
complexities of life as a college 
student, let alone during a pandemic. 

“The 
lack 
of 
details 
and 

transparency about the University’s 
reopening 
plans 
was 
very 

concerning,” Art & Design junior 
Maggie Wiebe said. “By the time it 
became apparent how ill-planned 
and dangerous the University’s 
reopening plan was, it was already 
too late for most people to change 
their plans for the fall.” 

For R.A.s, lack of sufficient 

personal protective equipment, no 
enforcement mechanisms for social 
distancing or mask-wearing and 
little transparent communication 
from the University make the 
risk of transmission and fear of 
transmission unnecessarily high. 
For graduate students, the lack of 
a universal right to work remotely, 
no representation in the decision-
making process and an insufficient 
universal child care subsidy make 
their lives as instructors and students 
dangerous and incredibly hard to 
balance. For the wider Ann Arbor 
community, public schooling has 
been remote in lieu of the University’s 
decision to bring students back to 

campus, and online schooling is more 
detrimental to K-12 education than 
to college. These mounting stakes 
and tensions made a strike effectively 
inevitable 
as 
negotiations 
and 

communications with the University 
were unproductive for both GEO and 
ResStaff. 

“We feel that a strike is necessary 

because the U-M admin has chosen 
to continue with their reckless and 
unsafe reopening plans without 
following the guidance of public 
health 
experts 
or 
their 
own 

ethics 
committee,” 
Dominique 

Bouavichith, a graduate student 
in Rackham Graduate School and 
member organizer of GEO, wrote in 
an email statement to The Daily. He 
continued, addressing the necessity 
of a strike itself, “GEO has tried to 
bargain toward our demands at the 
table, and the administration refused 
to budge in any substantive way…” 
This lack of action precipitated not 
only the GEO strike, but a strike of 
non-unionized R.A.s with similar 
sentiments. 

An R.A., who wishes to remain 

anonymous due to fear of retaliation 
from the University, expressed 
frustration and stated “The fact that 
(the administration) felt they needed 
to bring everyone back to campus to 
make money, when we don’t even 
have a firm enough pandemic plan 
so that students in quarantine are 
getting snacks, getting hot meals 
and consistently getting fresh soap is 
ridiculous.” 

The problems highlighted by 

this R.A., and the fact that they fear 
losing their housing for making 
these points publicly, are indicative 
of an administration that is blinded 
by corruption, stumbling into a 
dangerous “wealth-informed” fall 
semester. As corruption has plagued 
this 
particular 
administration, 

from 
repeated 
sexual 
assault 

and misconduct scandals to the 
mistreatment 
of 
the 
Dearborn 

and Flint campuses, a strike is the 
most — if not only — effective way 
to enact change. It leaps over the 
typical constraints that prevent 
action, having to operate on the 
University’s schedule and trying to 
separate activism and labor, and hits 
the University where it matters: the 
financials.

Striking, or withholding labor, 

is technically an illegal action for 
public unions to take in the state of 
Michigan. University President Mark 
Schlissel and Provost Susan Collins 
have leaned on this law in their initial 
patronizing messages to the wider 
university community as a scare tactic 
to push undergraduates away from 
taking actions in solidarity with GEO. 
This messaging should be ignored, 
and we should question whether this 
law has any relevant purpose except 
to prevent substantive institutional 
change from occurring. I urge unions 
and non-unionized groups across 
campus to consider this perspective 
while examining the possibility of 
joining GEO and the R.A.s, who will 
continue to organize despite the 
official strike ending. 

When the strike was ongoing, 

whether groups were moving forward 
as a union to strike alongside GEO 
or seeking actions to support their 
efforts, solidarity is important for the 
success of these collective demands. 
“It’s crucial to be supporting labor and 
workers … solidarity in organizing is 
how we will win,” University alum 
Hoai An Pham said. 

She continued, “The history of 

organizing and relationships that 
have been built up and cultivated until 
this point have undoubtedly made this 
strike stronger … one example of this 
could be from construction workers 
who are now striking because GEO 
workers joined construction worker 
picket lines years ago, or all of the 
undergrads who saw organizing done 
in years past and are joining the picket 
lines now because of that.” Solidarity 
among community allies is a must to 
support this necessary strike.

Admittedly, 
many 
are 
just 

beginning 
to 
understand 
the 

importance of strikes and hold some 
confusion about what has been 
occurring on campus. “Two big 
misconceptions … people think they 
can’t support or participate if they 
aren’t members of the union and 
that the workers are being selfish in 
shutting down the school. Both are 
false,” Vidhya Aravind, University 
alum and former solidarity and 
political action chair of GEO, stated. 

She continued, “Everyone is 

welcome on the line but there are a 
ton of virtual ways to show up too. 
The more disrupted campus life 
is, the more pressure UMich will 
face to rectify things … Remember, 
the people that care for us deserve 
comfortable work environments, 
and fair compensation and benefits. 
If they don’t have those things and 
the University refuses to give those 
things (as they are now), then they 
feel forced to strike.” 

GEO went on strike for anti-racist, 

abolitionist and community health 
demands, and continue to organize; 
R.A.s are still fighting for safe 
treatment, transparency from the 
administration and proper treatment 
of quarantined students; community 
members stand in solidarity with 
their work. Now, it is important to 
consider what comes next. While 
these efforts that are working toward 
community safety certainly have 
continued momentum, a general 
strike should have guaranteed that 
intersectional demands were met. 

Transportation, 
MDining 
and 

University faculty shouldn’t have to 
go on strike to be able to receive better 
hazard pay. Undergraduates shouldn’t 
have to walk out of classes that 
professors don’t cancel in solidarity. 
Ann Arbor families shouldn’t have to 
virtually or physically join the picket 
line to protect their community 
health, which is directly related to an 
outbreak at the University. But the 
swifter the collective action, the more 
effective it will be. Support organizers 
and strikers now. Solidarity forever.

Solidarity forever: an inevitable and necessary strike

f you’ve been on the Ann Arbor 
campus of the University of 
Michigan between 5 a.m. 

and 5 p.m. this past week, you’ve 
likely heard chants of “Solidarity 
Forever,” 
impassioned 
speeches 

about quarantine conditions and a 
noticeable lack of construction noise. 
If you haven’t figured it out by now, the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization, 
non-unionized resident advisers and 
a host of MDining staff have been 
striking to protest the University’s 
inexcusable mishandling of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. GEO has 
additionally 
emphasized 
the 

deconstruction of the University’s 
relationship with and reliance on 
the Ann Arbor Police Department 
and armed campus police. Simply 
put, these strikes on campus are 
necessary for the collective health 
and safety of the University and Ann 
Arbor as a broader community. On 
Wednesday, Sept. 16, GEO ended the 
strike after accepting an offer from 
the University. However, the broader 
problems of community health 
and systemic injustices still stand 
and ought to be analyzed after the 
historic strike came to an end.

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization strike has highlighted 
two issues confronting institutions 
of higher education: the pandemic 
response and policing. Many see these 
two issues as being disconnected, 
believing that one is a public health 
issue while the other is not. However, 
policing is an important public health 
issue that should be considered as 
part of a “public health-informed” 
semester that reflects a commitment 
to addressing structural racism. 

The field of public health is 

primarily concerned with preventing 
death and illness. Police can cause 
both direct and indirect physical 
and mental harm. Between 2012 and 
2018, 6,295 men were killed by police, 
and from 2001 to 2014, boys and men 
aged 15-34 were treated in hospital 
emergency departments for injuries 
caused by police violence at a similar 
rate to that of pedestrians injured 
by motor vehicles. Black women 
are disproportionately represented 
among women who are killed by the 
police, and women of color are more 
likely to experience sexual violence 
at the hands of police. Many other 
groups — like LGBTQ+ individuals, 
immigrants, homeless people, those 
with 
low-socioeconomic 
status 

or mental health disorders — also 
experience heightened risk of police 
violence. 

Policing also negatively impacts 

mental 
health. 
Even 
police 

encounters that are not physically 
violent, including being stopped 
on the street or verbally harassed 
by police, have substantial and 
disproportionate 
public 
health 

impacts. 
Such 
encounters 
are 

linked to heightened depressive 
symptoms and higher rates of 
trauma, anxiety and post-traumatic 
stress. Negative encounters with 

law enforcement are also linked to 
heightened mistrust and avoidance 
of health care institutions, which 
is particularly concerning amid a 
pandemic. Racial bias in surveillance, 
arrests and sentencing contribute to a 
disproportionate risk of incarceration 
and associated adverse mental and 
physical health impacts.

Decisions made by postsecondary 

institutions 
regarding 
campus 

policing and relationships with 
local police departments are critical 
for the health and well-being of 
students, faculty and staff, as well 
as the surrounding communities. 
There 
are 
opportunities 
for 

colleges and universities, including 
our own, to divest from harmful 
policing practices and instead take 
a public health-oriented approach, 
addressing policies and practices 
which disproportionately impact 
marginalized groups. 

The 
current 
conversation 

on the University of Michigan 
campus offers opportunities to 
critically examine responses by 
the University to the COVID-19 
pandemic using a public health lens 
that encompasses consideration of 
policing practices. For example, the 
Michigan Ambassadors program — 
a student-led initiative that partners 
with campus police — involves 
surveillance and reporting of “non-
emergency 
compliance 
issues” 

related to COVID-19 (e.g. failure to 
wear a mask, large social gatherings). 
Unfortunately, 
given 
well-

established patterns of racial bias in 
policing and reporting on campus, 
such programs place students of 
color at a disproportionate risk. 
Alternate strategies to slow disease 
transmission through a focus on 
structural and community change, 
rather than surveilling individual 
behaviors, should be considered. 

In 2018, the 25,000 member 

American Public Health Association 
formally 
recognized 
policing 

practices as a public health issue 
with 
disproportionate 
adverse 

impacts on racialized communities. 
APHA’s 
evidence-based 
policy 

statement, states, “Physical and 
psychological 
violence 
that 
is 

structurally 
mediated 
by 
the 

system of law enforcement results 
in deaths, injuries, trauma and 
stress that disproportionately affect 
marginalized populations.” Other 
major health organizations — like 
the American Medical Association — 
have issued similar declarations. 

Recognizing the essential role 

of community safety in supporting 
public health, the APHA policy 
statement advocates for community 
safety through investing in the social 
determinants of health (e.g., housing, 
education, 
jobs); 
decriminalizing 

poverty, mental illness and substance 
use; and implementing community-
based alternatives to addressing 
harms and preventing trauma (e.g. 
transformative justice, restorative 
justice). The point is that ensuring 

safety does not require funding 
armed police but rather investing in 
programs that address root causes.

Institutions of higher education 

can reduce the harmful effects of 
policing by critically examining 
existing contracts with local police 
departments, 
actively 
pursuing 

alternatives and modeling the type 
of transformative change that is 
required through the management 
and funding of their own campus 
safety 
programs. 
Resources 

currently invested in policing can 
be redirected to expanded mental 
health 
services, 
evidence-based 

sexual assault prevention, affordable 
housing, tuition, equal pay and 
other factors critical to supporting 
a diverse, equitable and just campus 
and community. Creating a campus 
environment that prioritizes these 
supports over armed police facilitates 
learning and allows all members — 
particularly those most negatively 
impacted by policing — to thrive. 

Many 
institutions 
of 
higher 

education have already begun to take 
these steps. Following a request by 
Jael Kerandi, student body president 
of the University of Minnesota, 
and the killing of George Floyd by 
Minneapolis police, University of 
Minnesota President Joan Gabel 
severed ties to the Minneapolis 
police force in May 2020. More than 
85 graduate student unions, faculty 
unions, undergraduate groups and 
thousands of university-affiliated 
individuals have signed a cross-
campus statement calling for their 
respective institutions to similarly 
cut ties with local police. Additionally, 
Johns Hopkins University, Harvard 
University and Yale University have 
all recently questioned the role of 
campus police. 

Campus 
policing 
practices, 

including contracts and agreements 
with local police departments and 
federal agencies, have powerful 
implications for efforts to foster 
a diverse, equitable and inclusive 
campus that supports the physical 
and mental well-being of students, 
faculty and staff. A truly “public 
health-informed” plan for workplace 
safety on campus must recognize 
how policing impacts health and 
must work actively to improve upon 
the health of all members of the 
community.

The problem that doesn’t exist

T

he month of May this year 
had been shaping up to be an 
excellent time for Doja Cat. 

The Los Angeles rapper and singer 
is an undeniable hitmaker, with her 
song “Mooo!” becoming a viral hit in 
2018 and her song “Say So” reaching 
No. 1 on the Billboard charts on 
May 11. However, her success soon 
turned to controversy later that 
month when she was accused of 
hanging out in internet chat rooms 
with racist incels the same day her 
unreleased song “Dindu Nuffin,” 
a term which is disparaging 
to victims of police brutality, 
resurfaced from the depths of 2015. 
As #DojaCatIsOverParty began 

trending on Twitter, it was clear 

that the internet had made its 
decision: Doja Cat was canceled.

Doja Cat, to some of her 

defenders and fans, was a victim 
of “cancel culture.” Defined by 
dictionary.com as the “popular 
practice of withdrawing support 
for (canceling) public figures and 
companies” when they’ve done 
something that the public finds 
“objectionable or offensive.” The 
goal of canceling someone is to 
punish them. Both former President 
Barack 
Obama 
and 
President 

Donald Trump have lambasted the 

idea, with the latter calling it “the 

definition of totalitarianism” in a 
speech at Mount Rushmore in early 
July. To many people in the public 
sphere, cancel culture seems to be, 
and often is, public enemy number 
one. It stops its targets from being 
able to grow from their mistakes 
and does nothing but show how 
intolerant and polarized we’ve all 
become.

Cancel culture isn’t without its 

supporters, though. Adherents to 
cancel culture see it as a way of 
teaching the person, brand or retailer 
being canceled, a lesson. They did 
something wrong, so to boycott 
their work can seem like an obvious 
solution to those who support the 
idea of cancel culture. According to 
American writer Camonghne Felix, 
cancel culture can serve as “a way 
for marginalized communities to 
publicly assert their value systems 
through pop culture.” In that 
way, cancel culture gives those 
typically silenced in mainstream 
conversations a voice. In their eyes, 
this works. 

However, I have to disagree: 

Cancel culture doesn’t work because 
it doesn’t exist.

Can you name someone who has 

actually been canceled? R. Kelly? 
J.K. Rowling? PewDiePie? 

R. Kelly, currently facing, 18 federal 

counts of various sex crimes, enjoys 
more than five million Spotify monthly 
listeners — albeit from a Chicago 
correctional 
facility. 
Additionally, 

J.K. Rowling, childhood icon-turned-
TERF, still reaps the profit from her 
seven-book Harry Potter franchise 
and the accompanying movie series. 
PewDiePie, the gamer who had more 
than a few antisemitic moments, has 
more than 106 million subscribers 
on YouTube after signing a live-
streaming deal with the media giant. 

The word “canceled” has always 

had a sense of permanence to me, 
and by that standard, none of these 
people were really canceled. Maybe 
“paused” could be a better word for 
it, but by all accounts, Kelly, Rowling 
and PewDiePie have all lived on and 

continued to amass enormous wealth. 
Hardly anyone labeled as a victim of 
cancel culture ever really suffers long-
term. 

Doja Cat’s canceling in May of 

2020 wasn’t even her first time being 
canceled. It happened August of 2018 
when Twitter users discovered her 
tweets containing homophobic slurs 
from 2015, and the subsequent apology 
still gets heralded as one of the most 
hilarious celebrity apologies ever. 
After that, Doja Cat was “canceled” for 
about a year, but once the “Hot Pink” 
rollout began, the rapper was back and 
even more successful than before. 

That still leaves me with the 

question: Has anyone ever been 
canceled? Despite what happened 
in May 2020, August 2018 and the 
rest of Doja Cat’s problematic history 
— including, but not limited to, 
appropriation of Hindu culture in her 
“So High” music video — the rapper 
is thriving, having just performed a 
medley of two of her biggest hits in 
this year’s MTV Video Music Awards 
show. Even the people we assume 
to be the most thoroughly canceled 
still retain strong followings outside 
of mainstream approval, however 
small and quiet their supporters 
might be. People like what they like, 
and some are able to separate the art 
from the artist. To them, it doesn’t 
matter what the artist has said 
because they can’t “make the music 
not bop,” as explained by YouTube 
vlogger As Told By Kenya.

W

hen I think of a social 
media influencer, I 
typically think of a 

young, white woman promoting 
skin care products and niche 
clothing brands to her 10,000 or 
more followers between posts 
about her glamorous life. I follow 
a couple of influencers, vaguely 
interested in the pseudo-fame that 
comes with having an Instagram 
platform and occasionally taking 
their book recommendations or 
recipe ideas. I associated these 
influencers 
almost 
exclusively 

with young people and direct-to-
consumer brands until I stumbled 
upon an article about Brooklyn and 
Bailey.

Brooklyn and Bailey are twins 

who attend Baylor University in 
Waco, Texas. They have almost six 
million followers on Instagram. 
Their feed is filled with wholesome 
pictures of themselves in lakes 
and 
parks 
with 
“highlights” 

about dating, hair and clothes. 
Other than their unusually large 
number of followers, they fit my 
preconceived notion of Instagram 
influencers. However, they do have 
one unusual paid partner — Baylor 
University — which has paid them 
for one to two promotional posts 
per semester since 2017. Neither 
Baylor nor the women have said 
how much they get paid for this 
partnership, but with millions of 
followers, Brooklyn and Bailey are 
considered “macro-influencers,” a 
status that allows them to garner 
up to $25,000 per post for product 
placements.

It is likely that I never would 

have heard of them had they not 
recently 
contracted 
COVID-19. 

Brooklyn and Bailey want to make 
sure you know that Baylor has 
“taken every precaution” and that 
“it is NOT due to in person classes 
that this happened.” The post is 
not sponsored by Baylor, but the 
sisters seemed to have anticipated 
that people would have questions 
about where they contracted the 
virus, and that as paid emissaries, 
they would be best-off supporting 
Baylor’s policies. 

Schools 
want 
to 
sell 
an 

experience. That’s why they hire 
young, “cool” students to post 
on 
their 
personal 
Instagram 

or Youtube accounts. Because 
COVID-19 forced students to forgo 
most of the campus experience 
that they’ve been sold on, there 

is conflict. Brooklyn and Bailey 
got caught in the middle, getting 
paid to make their school look fun 
and inviting while simultaneously 
contracting a disease that makes 
the fun and inviting campus 
experience impossible. 

While Baylor may not be 

explicitly paying Brooklyn and 
Bailey to promote its COVID-
19 safety plan, the University of 
Missouri is doing just that. The 
Missouri school contracted with 
an outside firm to hire up to six 
campus social media influencers to 
spread information about campus 
COVID-19 guidelines. The amount 
paid to each ambassador has not 
been made public, but Missouri 
paid the outside firm, Glacier, 
$10,300 for the project. 

The 
student 
ambassadors’ 

captions read like they were posted 
by the University of Missouri itself. 
“I’ve partnered with the University 
of Missouri to encourage the safety 
measures outlined in their Renewal 
Plan (available through the link 
in my bio!),” one post reads, later 
promoting the campus symptom 
checker app. Other student posts 
are slightly more colloquial, telling 
students “we gotta be safe” or 
including emojis.

Most of the Missouri students 

have between 1,000 and 2,000 
followers, 
which 
is 
nothing 

compared to the reach of Brooklyn 
and Bailey, but still a sizable 
number of followers for what is an 
inherently local campaign. 

I can’t quite figure out how 

I feel about the practice of 
paying students for social media 
promotional material. On the one 
hand, at least before COVID-19, 
social media promotional posts 
were 
almost 
certainly 
more 

effective than the thousands of 
emails and brochures that college 
send to students during their junior 
and senior years of high school. 
Peer to peer marketing, especially 
for my generation, is an increasingly 
successful and common marketing 
tactic. As students who are usually 
only a few years removed from 
high school, undergraduates are 
likely to have high schoolers, who 
are 
prospective 
undergraduate 

students, following their accounts. 

On the other hand, as blogger 

Anne Helen Petersen points out, 
it is ridiculous that influencers get 
paid for promoting their school, but 
college athletes, who often promote 

their schools on national television, 
do 
not. 
NCAA 
regulations 

expressly prohibit schools from 
paying students for name, image 
and 
likeness 
activities, 
which 

includes social media. Additionally, 
students of color are regularly used 
in school promotional materials 
without compensation. To schools, 
these students prove that their 
campuses are diverse, welcoming 
places in much the same way that 
paid influencers do, just without 
payment. 

Paying students to be COVID-19 

safety influencers seems different 
in that their target audience is 
primarily people who already pay 
tuition. It’s about behavior, not 
directly about generating future 
tuition revenue. But as cases 
spike in Boone County, where the 
University of Missouri is located, 
it’s hard not to feel like a couple 
of social media posts calling on 
students to wear masks and use 
the symptom tracker serves only 
to gloss over the severity of a 
pandemic potentially spreading 
across the campus and university 
community. The University of 
Michigan doesn’t pay social media 
influencers for promoting COVID-
19 safety measures or otherwise, 
at least publicly. And why should 
they? During a normal September, 
Instagram would be flooded with 
thousands of unpaid students 
posting pictures of themselves 
smiling and dressed in head-to-
toe U-M gear. This September, I’ve 
reflected on whether or not I want 
my personal social media feed to 
be an inadvertent advertisement 
for the University. In wake of the 
University’s botched responses to 
sexual violence in our community, 
disregard 
for 
the 
safety 
of 

faculty and staff and seeking an 
injuction against its own Graduate 
Employees’ Organization, I can 
not bring myself to post with 
pride about the Block ‘M’ anytime 
soon. Number of followers aside, 
personal posts about U-M are 
advertisements for a university 
I cannot in good conscience 
advertise right now. To my fellow 
students who may be tempted to 
post a cute picture of themselves 
in Maize and Blue: I get it. But free 
advertising for the University of 
Michigan? I don’t think so.

S

omething seemed off.

On an unseasonably 

cold Thursday evening in 

Freeland, Mich., the “American 
Carnage” president stood side-
by-side 
with 
the 
so-called 

“American 
Dream” 
Senate 

hopeful. 
The 
crowd 
broke 

out into a chant, yelling “we 
love you,” at the bi-racial duo. 
President Donald Trump ceded 
the floor as, miles from a Black 
Lives Matter protest, a former 
victim 
of 
police 
violence 

praised law enforcement. In 
the automotive capital of the 
world, the businessman lauded 
the 
president’s 
trade 
war 

that hurt the manufacturing 
sector. In a former hub of 
the 
underground 
railroad, 

the great-grandson of a slave 
celebrated the president who 
called his ancestral homeland 
a shithole.

John 
James 
stands 
with 

Trump 2,000%.

On the campaign trail, John 

James, a Republican candidate 
for Senate, likes to tell the 
story of his family going in 
four generations from slave to 
sharecropper to truck driver 
to potential senator. However, 
James’s retelling of this story 
omits some key details: While 
his father did work as a truck 
driver, he also founded a multi-
billion-dollar company. While 
James likes to claim he hit a 
triple, the reality is that he was 
born on third base. 

James was raised in the 

upscale Detroit community of 
Palmer Woods. He attended 
an 
overwhelmingly 
white 

Catholic high school, Brother 
Rice, in the posh northern 
suburb of Birmingham. At 
Brother Rice, James learned 
the values of a warrior — their 
official mascot — despite the 
school’s 
logo 
resembling 
a 

rejected first draft of Chief 
Wahoo. Naturally, these values 
led James to become an actual 

warrior, 
graduating 
from 

the military academy at West 
Point in 2004 and serving as 
a combat pilot for eight years, 
including multiple tours in 
Iraq. After obtaining his MBA 
from University of Michigan’s 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business, 

he was hired at his father’s 
company, the James Group 
International, and became the 
director of operations.

JGI 
has 
a 
complicated 

business model which cannot 
be easily summarized in a 
sentence or two, but crucially, 
they 
rely 
heavily 
on 
the 

automotive industry. In 2012 — 
with the industry revitalized 
by the Obama administration’s 
bailout 
— 
business 
was 

booming. James leveraged the 
company’s success to obtain 
media plaudits, earning a place 
on Detroit Business Journal’s 
30 in their 30s — producing an 
incredible picture — and The 

Michigan Chronicle’s 40 under 
40, but he was not content to 
rest on his laurels. Instead, 
once he was promoted to the 
unclear position of “president” 
while 
his 
brother, 
Lorron, 

leapfrogged him to become 
CEO, James waded into the 
political 
arena, 
challenging 

popular incumbent Sen. Debbie 
Stabenow, D-Mich., in 2018.

If 
John 
James 
wasn’t 

qualified to lead his family 
company, he isn’t qualified to 
lead Michigan.

During the campaign, James 

became a darling of the right 
wing, dubbed by party leaders as 
a rising star due to his unicorn 
status as a Black Republican. In 
the primary, a perfectly timed 
Trump endorsement carried 
him over the line, beating Sandy 
Pensler by 9.4%. However, in 
the November general election, 
Michigan voters brought the 
rising star down to earth, 
delivering James a swift kick 
in the rear and reelecting 
Stabenow by a 6.5% margin.

For most politicians, this 

would be the end of the story, 
but John James’ ingratiation 
with the president boosted 
him to the top of the list of 
candidates 
to 
run 
against 

Michigan’s other Democratic 
senator, Gary Peters, D-Mich., 
in 2020.

James 
announced 
his 

second bid for public office 
on Fox and Friends on June 
6, 2019 — the anniversary of 
D-Day — by highlighting his 
military service and railing 
against “career politicians.” In 
the early days, the campaign 
looked the same as before — 
with many appearances on Fox 
News and other conservative 
outlets in a craven attempt to 
raise money. However, about a 
year later, when George Floyd 
was tragically murdered in 
Minneapolis, 
Minn., 
James 

saw blood in the water. As a 
Black man, James was uniquely 
positioned to talk to several 
audiences, and he threaded the 
needle like a true politician, 
releasing a Twitter video days 
after the incident where he 
said, in part: “Ending injustice 
in this country is not a political 
talking point, it’s a matter of 
survival for me and my boys … 

That said … normal officers are 
heroes. They put their lives on 
the line every single day for us, 
even when provoked by rioters 
like last night.”

While this statement sounds 

nice, in the last part of the 
quote, he refers to the peaceful 
protests in Detroit on May 31 
as “riots,” which is simply an 
egregious mischaracterization 
of the facts.

It’s waffling, double-talking, 

misleading 
statements 
like 

this that have earned James 
praise from the media on both 
sides of the aisle, and that is 
fundamentally 
wrong. 
The 

man talks out of both sides of 
his mouth on race, knowing 
that he can manipulate mass 
media into giving him positive 
coverage. Meanwhile, his paid 
advertisements in the Metro 
Detroit area include almost no 
mention of his conservative 
policies, while many of his 
ads in Upper and Western 
Michigan feature almost no 
mention of his race. However, 
since we are at a time when 
white 
journalists 
aren’t 
in 

the position to oppose a Black 
man on race — especially now 
— James’s strategy has been 
largely 
successful, 
peeling 

off some Black support from 
Peters while bolstering his 
support among rural whites. 
Many journalists may be scared 
to call out James’s lifetime 
of privilege, his lack of clear 
policy goals and his disturbing 
record on race, but I am not.

John James is a fraud.
Growing up, as a Black man 

from the northern suburbs, 
I would scoff at the idea that 
someone like me could ever 
have success on a national 
stage. When I first saw James, 
I smiled for a second, proud to 
see someone who looked like 
me with a background like 
mine attaining a momentous 
achievement as the first Black 
major-party 
nominee 
for 

Michigan Senate in my lifetime. 
However, once I did more 
research on the man, the grand 
illusion 
of 
the 
36-year-old 

combat veteran was shattered 
along with my hopes that he 
was above the party line. 

Sadly, James succumbed to 

the bright lights of Fox News, 
revealing himself to be an 
inauthentic politician whose 
praise of the racist, sexist, 
transphobic orangutan with a 
bad dye job in the White House 
offends my sensibilities as a 
human being, an American 
citizen and a Black man. I 
cannot justify voting for James, 
especially 
when 
the 
man’s 

hypocrisy is so blatant. That 
is something that everyone, 
Republican, Democratic and 
Independent can understand.

iserable. If I had to 
think of one adjective 
to 
describe 
the 

impacts of COVID-19, it would 
be miserable. With everything 
we as a nation have encountered 
these 
past 
six 
months 
— 

quarantine, 
a 
heightened 

intensity of the Black Lives 
Matter movement and a divisive 
presidential election — you 
would think we’ve reached our 
collective breaking point. Yet, 
for many of us, personal events 
have brought an additional 
source of despair in this already 
discouraging time. 

Recently, 
Fox 
Sports 
1’s 

Skip Bayless criticized Dallas 
Cowboys 
quarterback 
Dak 

Prescott for publicizing his 
emotions following his brother’s 
suicide in April. Prescott said 
that he “experienced emotions 
he’d never felt before” during 
the period of isolation, including 
“anxiety 
and 
depression.” 

Bayless responded by stating 
that he doesn’t “have sympathy” 
for Prescott’s depression as 
“the quarterback of America’s 
Team.” He emphasized that a 
quarterback 
shouldn’t 
show 

signs of “weakness” because 
it hinders his credibility as a 
leader.

People eventually die, yes. It 

is the most inevitable outcome 
in life, right alongside taxes. 
However, suicide is perhaps the 
most unexpected cause. One 
person takes their life every 
40 seconds, yet few people can 
pinpoint warning signs, making 
it an extremely traumatic event 
to process. 

Personally, I am shocked 

at the senselessness of Bayless’s 
judgement. 
Mental 
illness 

cannot be controlled with a 
switch; 
it 
doesn’t 
instantly 

shift 
from 
on 
to 
off. 
It’s 

uncontrollable — Prescott can’t 
choose whether or not he has 
it. According to the Anxiety 
and Depression Association of 
America, there are roughly 16.1 
million other Americans who 

suffer from depression as well.

Additionally, 
individuals 

internalize 
grief 
differently. 

What if Prescott opening up 
in an interview facilitates his 
recovery? Maybe he’s finally 
reached the acceptance stage in 
his grieving process. Bayless, on 
the other hand, has yet to even 
learn the psychology behind it. 

Not to mention, Prescott 

speaking up about a “taboo” 
subject makes him a stronger 
leader. The action itself can 
inspire others to use their 
voices. I imagine Prescott’s 
teammates are ready to run 
through a wall for him and 
may confide in him before 
other players. When a support 
network is created through 
an 
emotional 
circumstance, 

especially at a poignant time, it 
creates unbreakable unity.

As much as some of us would 

like to categorize how we feel 
solely 
as 
“pandemic-related 

depression,” we cannot. These 
days, it is nearly impossible 
to separate the causes of our 
internal 
emotional 
status. 

Someone can simultaneously be 
anxious about contracting the 
virus and saddened by forced 
isolation from others. Worse 
yet, the two distinct emotions 
can be strikingly similar. Now, 
add the impact of a family 
member’s death. That burden 
bears 
exponentially 
more 

weight.

In our society, there are 

too 
many 
individuals 
who 

fail to understand both the 

seriousness of depression and 
lack the ability to sympathize 
with those affected by the 
illness. 
Bayless 
could 
have 

publicly apologized the next day 
on his show and emphasized 
that he made a grave error in 
judgement. But he didn’t. How 
apathetic can a person be before 
they realize the extent of their 
words?

I believe we, as humans, are 

compassionate at our core. Even 
though we don’t always show it, 
we always contain the ability 
to help others. We want to 
counsel those who are grieving, 
by lessening their isolation and 
thus easing their pain. Why 
should we settle for anything 
less?

In 
this 
current 
time 

especially, 
we 
have 
to 
be 

proactive in assisting those 
with mental illness. We cannot 
idly stand by, watching them 
become worse while knowing 
we can help. Instead, we must 
ask ourselves — and others — 
how we can facilitate aid. For 
those of us who are unsure of 
how to do so, we can start by 
educating ourselves. We don’t 
need to be heroes, but even a 
small, concentrated effort can 
make a big difference. 

When COVID-19 reaches its 

conclusion, I hope that people 
realize the power of altruism 
to produce good in this world. 
This selflessness can come in 
many forms, but it is required. 
The ability to sympathize with 
and comfort those in pain 
will be different for everyone. 
Regardless, providing emotional 
support is a task we are more 
than capable of accomplishing. 

If you or someone you know 

has a mental illness, is struggling 
emotionally, or has concerns 
about 
their 
mental 
health, 

there are ways to get help. Call 
1-800-273-TALK (8255) or text 
“HELLO” to 741741.

Even a small, 
concentrated 

effort can make a 

big difference.

T

his week, President Donald 
Trump came to Michigan 
to ask for our votes in an 

election that’s now less than 50 days 
away. But Trump didn’t come to 
Michigan to campaign to undecided 
voters. At no point did he make 
any discernible attempt to have an 
honest conversation with Michigan 
voters about issues and policies 
that affect their lives. Instead, 
Trump’s superspreader grievance 
tour touched down in Saginaw on 
Thursday night. 

The 
president 
urged 
his 

supporters to show up at polling 
places to confirm their absentee 
ballots had been counted, a move 
intended to both call the results 
of the election into question and 
to encourage his supporters to 
intimidate other voters at the polls. 
This wasn’t the first time he made 
such a ridiculous request — he’s been 
repeating it since his rally in North 
Carolina earlier this month where 
he told attendees to “vote twice in 
the November election.” But as the 
president continues to push people 
to trust only an election result in his 
favor, it is worth looking into why 

Trump is so sure he’ll lose an election 
fair and square, and why Michigan 
could hold the key to ridding our 
democracy of its greatest threat since 
the Civil War.

Michigan played an integral role 

in handing Trump the keys to the 
White House in 2016. Whether or 
not the swing state was legitimately 
up for grabs isn’t the question – of 
course it was. While most polls 
consistently showed Democratic 
nominee Hillary Clinton with an 
edge in the state, it was close to the 
margin of error as the election drew 
close. How Trump managed to come 
out of that night with Michigan’s 
sixteen electoral votes should serve 
as a cautionary tale in 2020. His 
margin of victory was less than 
the number of votes received by 
minor candidates. Former President 
George W. Bush proved in 2000 that 
all you need to win a close election is 
a spoiler.

While the president of the United 

States is a world-renowned idiot, he 
has some politically-savvy minds 
working to muddy the electoral 
waters in his favor. “I like Kanye 
very much,” may seem like a 

strange thing for Donald Trump, a 
candidate for the presidency, to say 
about Kanye West, a “candidate” 
for the presidency. Why would a 
candidate like Trump, a man whose 
reputation is literally built on the 
back of treating his opponents like 
human garbage, offer such kind 
words about an opponent with the 
name-recognition and unorthodox 
appeal that West has? It probably 
isn’t a blistering shock to discover 
that while the GOP knows West 
has no chance to win the election, it 
also knows his campaign can serve a 
purpose for Trump. 

If, by colluding with West, Trump 

can trick enough people into voting 
for the rapper, he has a fighting 
shot in multiple swing states where 
he’s currently running well behind 
Democratic nominee Joe Biden. A 
537-vote difference in Florida brought 
on by liberal activist Ralph Nader’s 
third-party candidacy ensured Bush’s 
victory in that election. In 2016, then-
candidate Trump again showed the 
value of a third party candidacy in a 
polarizing campaign, capitalizing on 
third party spoilers to win Michigan, 
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 

2016. In 2020, he has weaponized 
the spoiler candidacy, no longer just 
incidentally benefitting from it, but 
actively exploiting it for his own gain.

While Biden’s polling edge is 

bigger than Hillary Clinton’s at this 
point in the race four years ago, so is 
the spectre of third party candidacy 
in 2020. Gary Johnson was a perfectly 
nice guy and Jill Stein was a perfectly 
(probably) unwitting Russian asset, 
but neither candidate’s campaign was 
as titillating as West’s, and neither had 
such a strong opportunity to make 
genuine mainstream inroads. Of 
course, though, neither was actively 
accepting assistance from allies to the 
sitting president of the United States. 
West’s name recognition, especially 
among young voters, makes him a 

uniquely haunting prospect for 

our democracy. All West has to do 
is pull enough uninformed voters 
underneath his umbrella to earn a 
truly catastrophic place in American 
history, and people our age have the 
best opportunity to stop it. 

West has a unique resource 

for a candidate: a personal image 
cultivated outside the scrutiny of 
Washington, D.C., and the political 

press. Because that same press treats 
his candidacy as illegitimate, it has 
become derelict in its scrutiny. In 
2016, that political mythologizing 
of Trump — “He’s a successful 
businessman,” “He tells it like it 
is,” “He’ll run the country like a 
business,” actually came true, but 
only if you had rampant nepotism 
and corruption in mind — was 
one of his strongest appeals on his 
way to winning the election. If it 
resonated on such a large scale 
four years ago, who’s to say West, 
with Republicans at his side, can’t 
exploit that phenomenon on a much 
smaller scale? That’s all he has to do. 
Through that lens, his candidacy 
is not funny; it is not a joke and it is 
certainly not to be taken lightly. 

Anybody who has ever set foot 

on a college campus knows how 
hard it is to get young adults to 
take anything seriously. That’s 
a challenge that gets amplified 
exponentially when you throw 
names like “Trump” and “Kanye” 
into the mix. It’s important that these 
problems are contextualized for the 
young voters who are most likely 
to make these mistakes. A vote for 

Kanye West is a vote for the payroll 
tax cuts Trump used to dupe people 
into not realizing that he’s driving 
Social 
Security 
to 
insolvency. 

Student debt totals over $1 trillion 
in the U.S., but a vote for Kanye 
West ensures that your debt stays 
on the books, while corporations 
and the top 1% of wage-earners 
continue to reap the benefits of 
the excess income Trump’s 2017 
tax cuts handed them. A vote for 
West is a vote for the $141 million 
in taxpayer funds used since 2017 
to finance the logistics of Trump’s 
277 golf outings as the “leader” of the 
free world. 

Kanye West has created art that 

resonates with and uplifts millions 
of millennials and Gen Z’ers. His 
music has inspired countless young 
people around the world. He’s one 
of the most enigmatic, prolific and 
influential artists of our lifetimes. 
Don’t remember him for that. 
Remember him for trying to screw 
over your country for a generation. 
For our generation. Never forget it.

hree minutes without air, 
three hours without shelter, 
three days without water 

and three weeks without food. 
These are the rules of survival in the 
wilderness. The rule of three makes 
President Donald Trump’s most 
recent attack even more sinister, 
as he continues to spend his time 
in office trying to undo Former 
President Barack Obama’s legacy. 
Hidden by distractions of a global 
pandemic, 
nationwide 
protests 

and an economic decline, Trump’s 
Environmental Protection Agency 
removed coal plant regulation that 
revised the Clean Water Act passed 
in 1972 and will have catastrophic 
results on public health. This move 
was completed with the purpose 
of maximizing profits without any 
regard for the environment and the 
detrimental effects on health that 
will follow. 

Proving once again that his 

“drain 
the 
swamp” 
campaign 

slogan was a complete and utter lie, 
Trump nominated ex-coal lobbyist 
Andrew Wheeler to run the EPA. 
Throughout both his 2016 and 
2020 campaigns, Trump has put an 
emphasis on saving the dying coal 
industry. In Trump’s most recent 
attempt to revive coal, Wheeler 
revisited the adjustments made 

by the Obama administration in 
2015 requiring coal-fired plants to 
invest in treatment technology that 
keeps toxic wastewater out of the 
waterways, 
therefore 
protecting 

drinking water. The new revision 
cut out the requirement for state-of-
the-art water treatment technology. 
This move would save the plants 
money in the short term but would 
no longer require them to protect 
their neighboring waterways, likely 
causing more costly health problems 
and expenses down the road. Over 
two and a half million people have 
died from unclean water and the 
corresponding diseases that result 
from it. Depending on the type of 
chemical pollution, polluted water 
can cause liver damage, skin cancer, 
Dysentery and Malaria. Possibly 
the most disturbing and horrifying 
aspect of the new rule is that it will 
not require coal plants closing by 
2028 to follow any of the wastewater 
regulations, setting up potentially 
disastrous health and ecological 
effects 
on 
the 
surrounding 

community. 

Coal-powered plants leave behind 

wastewater filled with arsenic, 
lead and selenium which, if leaked 
into drinking water, can lead to 
cancer, 
reproductive 
problems 

and even neurological problems. 

Unfortunately, the residents of Flint, 
Michigan know just how devastating 
tainted water can be when water 
protection 
isn’t 
taken 
seriously. 

Insufficient water treatment and 
testing, paired with a slow, sometimes 
nonexistent, government response 
left Flint residents with health issues 
that could plague them the rest of 
their lives. 

In an attempt to close a $25 

million budget, former Michigan 
Governor Rick Snyder appointed an 
emergency manager in 2011 to help 
balance the budget. Two years later, 
that manager decided to temporarily 
pump water from the Flint River, 
where 
the 
water 
was 
highly 

contaminated, through aging water 
pipes where lead found its way into 
the drinking, bathing and cooking 
water. This led to developmental and 
growth damage, skin rashes and an 
outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, 
a rare form of pneumonia that took 
the lives of 12 people. At the same 
time, Nestlé was paying $200 a year 
to pump hundreds of thousands of 
gallons of water, just two hours away 
from where Flint residents were 
struggling to find clean water to drink 
and cook with. 

Trump’s EPA has continued with 

the principles we saw showcased in 
Flint by putting profits over the health 

and safety of communities. Following 
in the spirit of Ayn Rand, Trump has 
continued to roll back corporate and 
industry regulations, including nearly 
100 regarding the environment. So 
far, four water protection orders have 
been overturned with seven more 
in the process of being erased. In 
an attempt to save the coal industry 
money, Trump has cut through the 
bureaucratic red tape that requires the 
plants to look out for the environment 
they currently occupy. On paper, the 
recent EPA deregulation would save 

the coal industry $140 million every 
year but not without putting the 
health of over 1 million Americans 
who live within three miles of a coal 
plant at risk.

Environmental deregulation puts 

millions of lives at risk in exchange 
for short-term economic gains. This 
forces us to talk about how we value 
human and ecological life. Is a short-
term bump in stock dividends worth 
adversely hurting so many people? 
The answer to this question should 
be extremely clear. Human life is 

priceless and should be treated as 
such. Every single person needs clean 
water to survive, so it must be seen 
as what it is: a necessity. We need to 
reevaluate our relationship with the 
environment and how we interact 
with it. As a country and global 
community, we must stop putting the 
profits of the few before the health 
and safety of many. Most importantly, 
we must remember that water is life.

I

t’s hard to say how many 
undecided voters there still 
are, but to a good deal of them 

— perhaps, even, to a good deal of 
those who have already made up 
their minds — the idea of voting 
for presidential nominee Joe Biden 
or for President Donald Trump in 
November presents something of a 
Sophie’s choice. Trump has joked 
on Twitter that “Sleepy Joe” doesn’t 
know “what office he’s running for,” 
and that the former vice president 
“doesn’t know he’s alive.” Jackassery 
aside, the president has a point — 
Biden isn’t as sharp as he used to 
be. On the other hand, we have 
Trump — a narcissistic, woefully 
incompetent, 
grade-A 
lunatic. 

Hunter S. Thompson’s description 
of Richard Nixon as “... a man with 
no soul, no inner convictions, with 
the integrity of a hyena ...” is an apt 
branding of our current president, 
except the average hyena is probably 
more trustworthy and has a better 
command of international politics 
and morality. With less than two 
months to go, many Americans must 
be scratching their heads: Really? 
These two are the best we got?

As The New York Times’s Giovanni 

Russonello reported in June, the 
2020 election “could become only 
the second presidential contest in the 
history of modern polling in which 
both candidates are seen negatively 
by most voters.” The first was in 
2016. It wasn’t always this bad. With 
the exception of the 2016 election, 
each of the five presidential contests 
in my lifetime featured candidates 
who were reasonably likable. Since 
2000, the Democrats have nominated 
Gore, Kerry and Obama; the GOP has 
tapped Bush, McCain and Romney 
— all fairly likable and sane guys. So, 
what gives? Are the 2016 and 2020 
matchups just aberrations? Or is this 
what presidential politics will look like 
from now?

It is tempting to point to the 

benefits of a parliamentary system 
here. Under that framework, a party, 
rather than a specific candidate, 
gains the most seats in a national 
election and that party’s leader 
becomes the prime minister. In this 
alternate universe, a parliamentary 
system would likely deliver us “Prime 
Minister” Nancy Pelosi in the event 
of a Democratic win, or “Prime 
Minister” Kevin McCarthy should 
the Republican Party take back the 
House. 

Excluding those on the left who 

are unwilling to recognize the 
degree of Biden’s decline, and those 
on the right who are members of the 
Trump cult, these two are probably 
more palatable options than the 
ones we will have in November. The 
impossibility of the U.S. adopting 
the Westminster model aside, it is 
important to point out — if our metric 
is providing Americans with two 
fairly solid alternatives — that our 
electoral system has worked pretty 
well in the 232 years of its existence. 
Does it have other problems? 
Absolutely. 

What’s unique about our country’s 

political landscape today is the extent 
of our polarization. Intense political 
divides are of course nothing new, 
but looking at the past 50 years 
for context, it appears there hasn’t 
been as much philosophical real 
estate between the left and the 
right as there is today. Republicans 
ultimately respected people like Al 
Gore, and Democrats didn’t broadly 
question John McCain’s character. 
By 2016, something changed. To 
the left, Trump was a neo-fascist, 
race-baiting Putin wannabe and his 
base was too thick-skulled to realize 
how much damage he would do. To 
the right, Clinton was a calculating, 
condescending, sanctimonious tick, 
with an untrustworthy base that 
would lick the floor to put her in the 

Oval Office. The rhetoric, on both 
sides, became unhinged; it was, and 
is even more so today, vicious and 
visceral in the absolute. 

Couple this intense polarization 

with incessant media coverage every 
time Trump fires off a tweet or 
Biden jumbles his words, and it’s no 
wonder why we all become further 
entrenched in our predispositions 
against the other guy. For better or 
worse — and it’s probably for worse 
— we have entered a Brave New Age 
of information inundation. That’s 
not going away in November, even if 
Trump does; that’s the world we live 
in.

Democrats believe that a Biden 

presidency will bless our country 
with a return to normalcy, which the 
Divine Providence knows we need. If 
we’ve paid any attention the past four 
years, however, it’s easy to see that 
these hopes are misguided. If Biden 
is sworn in as the 46th president 
on Jan. 20, 2021, Fox News will do 
what Fox News does best: lament the 
senility of the man in the Oval Office, 
predict the chaos and anarchy — 
perhaps even death of the republic 
— that a Biden presidency will allow 
and generally stir a conservative 
firestorm. The liberal media outlets 
will defend him tooth-and-nail 
against these attacks. In short, the 
roles will reverse, and the coverage 
will be more or less the same.

Lyndon Johnson said that being 

president “is like being a jackass in a 
hailstorm … There’s nothing to do but 
to stand there and take it.” Nearly 55 
years later, that’s what it feels like to 
be an American citizen. A change in 
president will not bring a change in 
the weather. The hailstorm will still 
rage, and we, the jackasses, will have 
to stand there and take it.

FILM REVIEW
‘The Babysitter’ is gory, mindless fun 

In need of a laugh and looking 

for a Tarantino knockoff with 
a B-list cast? Look no further 
than 
“The 
Babysitter: 
Killer 

Queen,” released last Thursday 
on Netflix. This film is a sequel 
to 
Netflix’s 
2017 
film 
“The 

Babysitter.” 
At 
the 
time 
of 

writing this, “Killer Queen” is 
#3 in the US on Netflix, but it 
peaked at #1. 

I 
pressed 
play 
with 
no 

intention of liking this movie. In 
fact, I was fairly certain that I’d 
have nothing but criticism for a 
cheesy, gory horror-comedy. And 
oh, is it cheesy. But I find myself 
eager to overlook the film’s many 
faults, and to appreciate the 
puerile one-liners for what they 

are: simple entertainment.

In 2017’s “The Babysitter,” 

Cole’s 
(Judah 
Lewis, 

“Demolition”) parents go out 
for the night, leaving him with 
Bee (Samara Weaving, “Guns 
Akimbo”), his babysitter and the 
apple of his eye. After Bee thinks 
Cole has gone to sleep, she invites 
some friends over for good old-
fashioned fun. One thing leads 
to another and (spoiler) Bee’s 
friends turn out to be members 
of a cult, having all made various 

deals with 
the devil. There is a ritual to 
be performed, and the young 
satanists 
need 
Cole’s 
blood! 

But Cole doesn’t plan to go 
down without a fight. With the 
help of his best friend and love 
interest Melanie (Emily Alyn 
Lind, 
“Doctor 
Sleep”), 
Cole 

emerges victorious and has his 
first kiss (thanks, Melanie!). 
The unfortunate part? Satan’s 
intercession 
involves 
an 

obstruction of justice and the 
destruction of evidence. In short, 
Cole’s parents don’t buy the 
“Satanic cult” story, and instead 
think their kid is delusional.

This brings us to 2020’s “Killer 

Queen.” Two years later, Cole is 
afflicted by flashbacks and an 
overactive imagination. There’s 
a new girl at school, enigmatic 
Phoebe (Jenna Ortenga, “Saving 
Flora”), destined to wind up 
involved in Cole’s predicament. 
Cole’s parents make him take 
pills, which don’t seem to help, 
and have resolved to send him 
off to a psychiatric high school. 
But once again, Cole lives by his 
own rules. Ditching school to 
party at “the Lake” with Melanie 
and her crew is certainly out of 
character for the shy and sharply 
dressed Cole, but his feelings 
for Melanie have him convinced 
that what he needs is to let loose. 
Needless to say, the party boat 
quickly becomes a crime scene, 

and Cole must fight his demons 
once again, now with Phoebe’s 
help.

This 
movie 
is 
fun. 
Yes, 

the 
characters 
are 
awfully 

shallow, and bodily fluids are 

sprayed with excessive force 
and 
frequency. 
And 
yet, 
I 

found myself engrossed. The 
incorporation of text, flashbacks 
and martial-arts battle between 
the two leading women all have 

a distinctly Tarantino flair. That 
is, if Tarantino was a 14-year-old 
boy. Astonishingly, the film is not 
without social critique, either; 
it seems these hellions are all 
seeking internet fame (which is 
ironic, given Alexander Bachelor, 
aka King Bach’s, leading role and 
Amanda Cerny’s cameo). The 
viewer is left with several clichéd 
aphorisms, the most relevant 
of which being “shortcuts don’t 
pay off.” In other words, earn 
your fame, don’t buy it from 
Satan. Perhaps the most off-
putting and unnecessary element 
of this film is the euphemistic 
montage, meant to represent 
Cole and Phoebe’s tryst, set to 
The Sugarhill Gang’s “Apache.”

Between pithy criticisms of 

influencer culture and seismic 
spurts of blood, this flick is 
funny. Bad acting and moderate 
ableism aside, director McG gets 
a lot right. If only because it does 
not take itself seriously, it’s best 
if the viewer doesn’t take this 
film seriously either. Perfectly 
mindless, 
funny 
enough 
and 

engaging — “The Babysitter: 
Killer Queen” entertains. When 
you next find yourself with a 
free evening, turn your brain 
off for a while and watch “Killer 
Queen.” I can’t say you won’t be 
disappointed, but I’m pretty sure 
it’ll make you grin.

Mainstream:
Don’t be so 
tough on TV

‘DROWNING IN THE MAINSTREAM’ COLUMN 

In 2013, Tina Fey opened her Golden Globes 

monologue with the line, “Tonight we honor the 
television shows that have entertained us all year, as 
well as the films that have only been in theaters for two 
days.” It was a sly quip at awards season releases, how 
the December month becomes saturated with the next 
best film. But as a matriarch of television, Fey was also 
poking fun at a phenomenon she probably knows all too 
well: People don’t view television as “art.”

Think about it — when you picture that bleach-haired 

boy in your film class playing devil’s advocate, what 
media does he project onto? He unplugs his Sufjan 
Stevens and tucks the Ayn Rand book into his backpack 
to begin an unprompted and unwanted discussion about 
the latest Tarantino movie (it’s not that HE doesn’t 
respect women, it’s that his CHARACTERS don’t). He’s 
not sweeping aside self-cut bangs to watch you as you 
talk about “Atlanta” or making side comments to his 
friend about how no one truly understands “Stranger 
Things,” because to the high society artist, television is 
not worth a critical eye. 

Whenever I coyly throw a television reference 

into conversation or get giddy over my favorite show 
restarting, too often the response I get is “Oh, I don’t 
watch TV.” Rarely do people say “I don’t really care for 
books,” or “I don’t listen to music much,” and when I 
mention that I am not really a movie person, every head 
turns with shock. But for some reason, television is a 
medium that is acceptable to ignore. 

In a lot of ways, I get it. Television — with its excessive 

advertisements and time-sucking nature — can be the 
medium most associated with indulgent consumerism. 
“The Irishman” didn’t have three separate Poptart 
commercials peppered throughout and no one is 
binging “The Lord of the Rings” franchise in a two-day 
bender. There are drawbacks when it comes to watching 
television, but that’s true with every art form. Not every 
movie you paid to see is going to be worth it, and not 
every album you anticipated is going to be great. But 
nobody stops watching movies or listening to music 
because of these realities, so why be so tough on TV?

One of the things that draws people to art so much is 

the opportunity to live through stories they themselves 
are not a part of and be moved to feel a range of emotions 
from something they could not create. I would argue 
that television is the medium that excels in this the most. 
There are very few movies in which the viewer can grow 
with characters over years, sometimes decades, and 
those that do feature such a thing get critical acclaim. 
Television exists beyond the constraints of 90 minutes, 
having multiple episodes and seasons to add depth to 
characters and create multiple story arcs. 

Those that abuse this opportunity to change and shift 

their shows fail loudly and miserably — “Community” 
refers to its own Season 4 as “the gas leak year” and 
many “Arrested Development” fans choose to ignore the 
existence of the last two seasons. But so many television 
shows run their course gracefully, ending in ways that 
are both artfully sound and fan-friendly. Two recent hit 
shows — “The Good Place” and “Schitt’s Creek” — both 
ended their run on the writer’s own terms, recognizing 
that the shows had run their course and therefore 
giving themselves the time and opportunity to flesh out 
proper endings. The results from both were particularly 

poignant for two network comedies, touching on topics 
ranging from a family’s love to the legacies we leave 
after we die. 

Denying yourself television is denying yourself the 

chance to truly fall in love with stories and characters, 
and to follow them beyond the confines of a two hour 
film. How can you worship “The Godfather” but never 
bother to watch “The Sopranos”? How can you watch 
every war movie ever released without recognizing the 
impact of “M*A*S*H”? How can you throw “Star Wars” 
posters up on your bedroom walls without even trying 
out “Battlestar Galactica?” Television comes in every 
genre we know and love, elongating the stories and 
offering us new characters that don’t disappear once the 
theater lights flick on. 

Watching television has been painted as the lazy 

man’s vice, the activity we partake in when there’s 
just nothing else to do. Yet I say to watch television is 
to observe art, to understand different people and be 
moved by different stories. Don’t be ashamed if your 
favorite form of media is television — whether it’s 
“Cutthroat Kitchen” or “Killing Eve.” Television is 
suspenseful, it’s disturbing, it’s clever and sometimes 
it’s downright dumb. No matter what it is, television is 
what you and your family or friends are always going to 
gather around for something to do, something to enjoy 
together.

TV REVIEW
‘Ratched’ dismisses its iconic origin

On a list of iconic movie villains, 

Nurse Ratched from the 1975 
Academy Award-winning “One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” 
usually ranks near the top. Based 
on the 1962 novel by the same 
name, the film quickly became 
a beloved part of American 
pop culture, mostly because of 
Jack 
Nicholson’s 
charismatic 

portrayal of Randle McMurphy 
as he struggles against Nurse 
Ratched’s oppressive practices 
on her psychiatric ward. 

“Ratched” 
is 
uninterested 

in 
acknowledging 
that 

legacy. Instead, it opts to be 
indistinguishable 
from 
any 

season 
of 
“American 
Horror 

Story” or otherwise generic Ryan 
Murphy 
production. 
Focusing 

on the titular nurse, this new 
Netflix 
series 
explores 
the 

origins of a Mildred Ratched 
(Sarah Paulson, “Mrs. America”) 
as she transitions from caring, 
compassionate caregiver to cold-

hearted 
sadist. 

Like most Ryan Murphy shows, 

“Ratched” opens on a brutal and 
bloody massacre. This massacre 
is of an entire Catholic clergy 
house of priests in 1947. A few 
months later, the killer, Edmond 
Tolleson 
(Finn 
Wittrock, 

“American Horror Story”), is 
headed to a psychiatric facility 
in scenic Lucia, California so 
that doctors can determine if he’s 
clinically insane or if he’s fit to 
stand trial and possibly recieve 
the death penalty.

Like Tolleson, Nurse Ratched 

is also headed to secure a job at 
the Lucia hospital. When the 
head of the facility, Dr. Hanover 
(Jon Jon Briones, “American 
Crime Story”), is hesitant to hire 
her, Mildred begins manipulating 
the staff, patients and even the 
governor of California in order 
to rise through the ranks and 
get close to the mysterious new 
admission, Tolleson. Before long, 
she’s befriended the governor’s 
wife Gwendolyn (Cynthia Nixon, 
“Sex and the City”) and secured 

her place as a the woman behind 
the curtain.

“Ratched” fails to stand out 

from the crowd of other Ryan 
Murphy shows on TV right now. 
Nearly every scene feels cut and 
pasted from “American Horror 
Story: Asylum” or the fellow 
Netflix 
series 
“Hollywood.” 

While the monochromatic color 
palette, sharp-tongued dialogue 
and graphic moments of sex 
and violence may have been 
groundbreaking a few years ago, 
this formula does “Ratched” little 
favors. This campy, slasher TV 
genre of the 2010s desensitized 
audiences long ago — there is 
nothing truly shocking left. 

Perhaps the most infuriating 

thing about this new series, 
however, 
is 
that 
it 
doesn’t 

feel remotely adjacent to its 
source material. The only thing 
connecting the titular character 
of “Ratched” to the villain of 
“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s 
Nest” is a name. What makes 
Nurse Ratched such an iconic 

character is the savagery of her 
mundanity, the weaponization 
of bureaucracy to suppress the 
vulnerable. With a show as 
in-your-face and over the top 
as “Ratched,” there’s no room 
for subtlety, reality or even just 
compelling commentary.

“Ratched” may find inspiration 

in its title, but the similarities 
end there. If viewers watch this 
series expecting something that 
honors the 1975 film, they’ll be 
disappointed. If viewers watch 
this 
series 
without 
knowing 

who Nurse Ratched is, they 
might enjoy the frivolity of the 
excessive gore and the 1940’s 
glamour. 
Without 
properly 

grounding itself, this Netflix 
series will waste its potential to 
revisit a classic character and 
remain indistinguishable from 
every other unnecessarily gritty 
franchise reboot on television.

Last spring, the Daily Film beat was 

inspired by the doldrums of quarantine 
and the introduction of Disney+ to watch 
and review a number of Disney Channel 
Original Movies — DCOMs for short. There 
are many ways to look at DCOMs — as relics 
of the 2000s, as problematic attempts at 
representation, as textbook examples of the 
power of nostalgia — but there is no denying 
that they are somewhat trivial in the grand 
scheme of things.

If we’re being honest, it’s been a while since 

quarantine has felt truly idle: Between the 
pandemic, protests and politics, the world 
feels as though it is unraveling. It can feel odd 
to talk about something as inconsequential 
as DCOMs when these past few months 
have been difficult for everyone in different 
ways, and we would be remiss if we didn’t 
acknowledge that. That said, there is a 
difference between reprieve and perpetuating 
ignorance. If you choose to go on this DCOM 
journey with us, we ask that you keep this in 
mind.

For us at the Daily Film beat, DCOMs 

were a big part of our childhoods. The Disney 
Channel has long been a staple of children’s 
entertainment, churning out hit TV shows, 
family-friendly pop stars and their beloved 
original movies. Over 100 original DCOMs 
have aired on Disney Channel since the 
DCOM banner began in 1997, raking in 
millions of viewers with each film. As a 
beat, we’ve decided to watch and review 
a number of these films, whether they’re 
musicals, classics or generally unknown. 
We all know that these aren’t exactly high-
concept — despite their charm, most DCOMs 
are incredibly low-budget, filmed cheaply 
in Canada with unseasoned child actors and 
awkward dialogue. So instead, our reviews 
are based on how much we enjoyed the film in 
the context of it being a 90-minute TV movie 
made for kids. We’re also aware that these 
reviews are particularly biased, fueled by 
nostalgia for the films, actors and music that 
defined our childhoods.

The first installment of this series will 

cover the first set of what we’re calling 
“Classic DCOMs” — well-known DCOMs 

that reached a wide audience through high 
viewer ratings and perpetual re-airings. 
Many of these DCOMs feature Disney 
Channel stars, killer 2000s soundtracks and 
iconic aesthetics. As you join us for this joyride 
of nostalgia and charmingly low quality, we 
only have one thing left to say:

“Hi, we’re the Film beat, and you’re 

watching Disney Channel.”

“Halloweentown” (1998)
Disney Channel in October was always an 

experience — fun, Halloween-themed movies 
playing every day of the month and new 
Halloween episodes of “Hannah Montana” 
and “Wizards of Waverly Place” on Sunday 
nights. What more could an eight-year-old 
ask for? Obviously, the only thing better than 
a month of Disney Halloween is to create 
a universe where Halloween is through 
the whole year; enter, “Halloweentown.” 
Released in 1998, the film is the first 
installment of four in which we meet the 
Pipers: Marnie (Kimberly J. Brown, “Quints”), 
Dylan 
(Joey 
Zimmerman, 
“Treehouse 

Hostage”) and Sophie (Emily Roeske, “Fell’s 
Redeemer”). The film also introduces their 
mother Gwen (Judith Hoag, “Forever My 
Girl”) and grandmother Aggie (Debbie 
Reynolds, “Singin’ in the Rain”). For Marnie 
and her siblings, the magic of Halloween is 
marred by the fact that their mother refuses 
to let them enjoy the holiday to the fullest, a 
tragedy for anyone who understands the joys 
of trick-or-treating. As the film progresses, 
the audience learns about Halloweentown, 
a world of warlocks, witches, trolls and other 
fantastical creatures. “Halloweentown” is 
one of the more impressive DCOM franchises, 
second only to “High School Musical.” The 
first film addresses how well we really know 
our parents. As 10-year-olds, we’ve really only 
been alive for a third of our parents’ lives, a 
fact that becomes increasingly clear when 
Marnie learns of her mother’s witchy history. 
On top of that, the films successfully create a 
whole other dimension with social issues that 
parallel those of the real world (for example, 
the prejudice towards “mortals”), all while 
maintaining that signature Disney pluck.

“Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century” (1999)
“Zenon” is arguably one of the most iconic 

DCOMs, with its neon color palette and 
costumes that gave millennials a nostalgic 
love of holographic outfits. The film is set in 
2049 on a private space station that Zenon 
Kar (Kirsten Storms, “General Hospital”) has 
called home for eight years. Despite growing 
up in space, Zenon is basically a normal 
13-year-old girl: curious and unapologetic, 
with boy band posters in her room and 
a vocabulary of unique slang terms (like 
“Zetus Lapetus” or “lunarious”). Clashes 
with the station’s rules lead to Zenon getting 
“grounded” — sent to live on Earth with 
her slightly agoraphobic Aunt Judy (Holly 
Fulger, “Anything But Love”). Adapting to 
life on Earth is not easy for Zenon, whether 
it’s understanding money, learning how to 
ride a bike or making friends. To make it 
harder, it’s suddenly up to her to save the 
space station and everyone on it. “Zenon” has 
a predictability to it, but it’s unique in terms 
of creative worldbuilding. It’s fun to see the 
idea of 2049 from a 1999 point of view: The 
tech gadgets are advanced but the rock stars 
still have frosted tips. The movie inspired two 
sequels, making it one of Disney Channel’s 
first franchises, and features Raven-Symoné 
(“That’s So Raven”) at the beginning of a long 
Disney Channel career. And while “Zenon” 
may inspire some questions — are all of the 
cars in 2049 Volkswagen Bugs? Did they really 
give a Northwestern University astronomy 
professor an unacknowledged cameo? How 
do I pull off a high side-ponytail like Zenon? — 
you can’t deny that this film is, as Zenon might 
say, totally lunarious.

Smart House (1999) 
“Smart” technology, beginning with 

the smartphone, has certainly changed the 
way we go about life — there’s little that isn’t 
documented through the help of an iPhone 
camera, and with the rise of technology like 
Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google 
Home, the idea of a smart house is no longer 
just a cheesy 1999 Disney movie, but rather 
our reality. In “Smart House,” technology 
and the way characters interact with it are 
surprisingly similar to today, regardless 
of the fact that “Smart House” is over two 

decades old. Ryan Merriman (“The Luck of 
the Irish”) plays Ben, a teenager desperate 
to make sure his family doesn’t forget their 
late mother, mainly by preventing his dad 
from ever meeting someone new. Part of this 
plan involves winning, and moving into, a 
“smart” house. And, at first, it seems to work 
— Pat, much like Siri or Alexa, is programmed 
to respond to whatever the family asks of 
her. Whether it’s finishing up homework 
or making a snack, this smart house can 
do it. What’s interesting is the warning 
that Disney gives regarding our reliance 
on technology. Ben programs the house to 
act as a surrogate mother, not realizing the 
detrimental effects this may have on his life. 
Expecting a computer to behave like a human 
is a dangerous idea with which many science-
fiction authors have grappled. In spite of the 
fact that it instills a fear of technology, Disney’s 
“Smart House” deserves much praise, if only 
because the dad (Kevin Kilner, “A Cinderella 
Story”) is beautiful.

“Johnny Tsunami” (1999)
“Johnny Tsunami” is one of the best, most 

literal takes on the DCOM fish-out-of-water 
story, centering Johnny Kapahaala (Brandon 
Baker, “One World”), who was born and 
raised in Hawaii. His grandfather Johnny 
Tsunami (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, “The Last 
Emperor”) is a legendary surfer and has been 
teaching Johnny to surf his entire life. The 
Kapahaala family isn’t always on the same 
page: Johnny’s father Pete (Yuji Okumoto, 
“The Karate Kid Part II”) has a troubled 
relationship with his father that extends to 
his relationship with Johnny, while Johnny’s 
mother Melanie (Mary Page Keller, “Duet”) 
tries to keep the peace. When the family 
moves to Vermont for Pete’s job, Johnny is 
forced to adapt, leaving Hawaii, surfing and 
his grandfather behind. He gets involved with 
winter sports, but finds himself in the middle 
of a bizarre turf war between private school 
and public school kids: Private school kids, 
known as Skies, are skiers, while public school 
kids, known as Urchins, are snowboarders. 
Even with the strange socio-economic 
undertones (did the public school kids really 
have to be called urchins?), it’s a status quo 
that’s itching to be broken. Despite going to 

private school, Johnny becomes friends with 
Sam (Lee Thompson Young, “The Famous 
Jett Jackson”), an Urchin who teaches him 
how to snowboard. Together, they dare to 
break the mold, hoping to unite the mountain 
in the process. “Johnny Tsunami” can be 
cheesy at times, but it’s generally delightful. 
It’s a wholesome movie about taking on 
challenges and being yourself, as well as a 
beautiful mix of surfing and snowboarding 
montages that make me miss the beach and 
the mountains at the same time. 

— Kari Anderson, Daily Arts Writer

“Luck of the Irish” (2001)
The plotline of “Luck of the Irish” is bonkers: 

15-year-old Kyle (Ryan Merriman, “Smart 
House”) discovers that he’s half-leprechaun 
after losing a family good luck charm. Kyle is 
a relatively popular basketball player with a 
lucky streak, so he finds it distressing when 
he starts having bad luck, as well as getting 
shorter and occasionally slipping into an Irish 
accent — all side effects of losing the lucky 
charm. He then has to work with his family 
and friends to get the charm back from a zany 
and maniacal villain (Timothy Omundson, 
“Psych”), a struggle that concludes with a 
bizarre Irish sports tournament. “Luck of the 
Irish” is occasionally hilarious, sometimes 
when the writers are trying to be funny and 
sometimes when they really aren’t. The 
writing is often awkward, and the strong Irish 
accents are impossible to take seriously. It’s a 
fascinating amalgamation that doesn’t always 
work — part fantasy and part sports movie, 
with a dash of Irish step-dancing and a strong 
through-line about heritage that essentially 
(and disappointingly) ends with “we’re all 
American.” It’s interesting to see where Disney 
tries to broach the idea of discrimination with 
a very brief discussion of anti-Irish sentiments 
in the 1800s, but it’s almost as interesting to 
wonder why so many people are invested in 
junior high school basketball. “Luck of the 
Irish” is such a weird film, but it’s fun enough 
to deserve some credit.

FILM NOTEBOOK
The film beat revisits Disney Channel Original Movies

The different forms of self within self-help books

DAILY FILM WRITERS

Daily Arts Writer

NINA MOLINA
Daily Arts Writer

I, like many other steadfast fiction readers, 

generally would not touch a non-fiction book 
with a ten-foot pole, preferring stories that 
offer an escape from my own mundane life. 
Once in a blue moon, I grudgingly venture 
into the world of non-fiction, feeling like 
I need to expand my repertoire of books, 
only to mentally check out after the first 
few pages. Why would I read about real life 
when imagination can conjure up scenarios 
that are so much more interesting? However, 
this year marked a surprising change for me. 
I entered the world of non-fiction books, and 
this time, I stuck around.

This adjustment came amid a time 

of extraordinary change, namely the 
emergence of COVID-19. During the long 
months of quarantine, many, inspired by 
online blogs or extreme boredom, decided 
to make use of their isolation by embarking 
on self-improvement journeys. As COVID-
19 spread through the country and people 
were forced to remain home, online yoga, 
meditation and mental health resources 
started popping up on social media 
platforms like Instagram and TikTok. I 
watched as my friends began undertaking 
self-improvement journeys, posting about 

their morning quarantine yoga flows, 
mediation sessions and Chloe Ting workout 
challenges. 

Unfortunately, I was not one of the 

productive 
quarantine 
types. 
Besides 

reading and baking a lot, I did not respond 
to complete social isolation with increased 
motivation like some others, who seemed 
to be checking off every life goal during 
quarantine (starting a podcast, really?). 
Nonetheless, I surprisingly ended up 
participating in the aforementioned self-
help trend. This summer I took a roadtrip 
across the country, and eight hours into 
the third day I was getting stir crazy from 
the boredom and monotony of the drive. 
Desperate for some entertainment, I looked 
for free audiobooks on Spotify. The only 
book I could find was Mark Manson’s “The 
Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck”. Having 
nothing else to do, I started listening and 
found myself immediately engrossed in the 
author’s philosophy on life. Five hours later, 
I had listened to the whole book, and it was 
through this experience that I stumbled 
onto a new genre of reading: self-help books.

After Manson’s book, I read two other 

self-help books in quick succession, “Daring 
Greatly” by Brenée Brown and “How to 
Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale 
Carnegie. What I found most interesting 
about these three books was how different 

each author’s message was. I found myself 
wondering, how do I know who to believe? 
Some ideas resonated more deeply with me 
than others, and I tended to lean toward the 
books that had practical applicability in my 
life or related to the issues I was currently 
facing. 

Each author approaches giving advice 

differently. Manson talks about his failures 
bluntly, and explains the experiences that 
led him to his current philosophy on life. 
His personal style is straightforward, 
unsparing and often raunchy. Rather than 
telling readers to ‘be positive’ and ‘look on 
the bright side’ like I had expected from self-
help books, he speaks frankly about what 
he thinks is wrong with people nowadays, 
and how they can fix themselves. Manson 
does not have a background in psychology 
or experience studying his ideas in practice, 
he simply explains his theory on having a 
fulfilling life and acknowledges his openness 
to being wrong and having more to learn.

Brenée Brown, on the other hand, has 

a somewhat different personal style from 
Manson; she is understanding, relatable and 
funny. I felt like I was having a conversation 
with a friend, as she took me through 
her own experiences with vulnerability 
and opening up. Brown also has a strong 
background in research and the study of 
human emotion, vulnerability, shame and 

leadership. She is therefore able to base all 
of her ideas on years of meticulous research, 
and grounds her recommendations in facts 
and studies. This came through in her book, 
as she references study after study that 
support her suggestions. I found myself 
trusting her due to the enormous amount 
of research that she presented as evidence, 
as well as her approachable and genuine 
personal voice. 

“How to Win Friends and Influence 

People” by Dale Carnegie diverged the 
most from the two other books. Carnegie 
suggests psychology-based techniques for 
becoming a more likeable and charismatic 
person, proposing tips on ways to make 
people like you, win people to agree with 
your way of thinking and change people 
without arousing resentment. I felt mildly 
embarrassed to be reading this book, feeling 
like I was being given insider information on 
how to trick people into liking me. 

In every book, I noticed the author’s 

experiences 
and 
background 
subtly 

intertwining 
themselves 
with 
their 

recommendation for how others could 
transform their lives. They viewed the 
world through the lenses of their own lives, 
and as a result, their conclusions included 
ideas that might not work for everyone. 
For example, Brenée Brown spoke a lot 
about her perfectionistic tendencies and 

how to mitigate them. Personally, I am 
not a perfectionist, so this portion of the 
book went entirely over my head. Manson, 
meanwhile, recounted his experiences 
dropping everything to travel the world, 
something I have always dreamed of doing. 
His findings were extremely interesting 
and clearly life-altering for him; however, 
his methods may not be the most suitable 
for everyone. Carnegie gave advice based 
on psychological techniques on how to 
make others like you. For me this did not 
resonate, as some of the strategies that 
Carnegie suggested seemed manipulative 
and underhanded to me. 

Reading these three wildly different 

books helped me understand that self-help 
books are not one-size-fits-all. Each book 
was a bestseller and incredibly popular 
among readers, and yet I had extremely 
different reactions to each one. I ended 
up picking and choosing the ideas that 
fit my own life and disregarding the rest. 
My struggles may not be the same as the 
authors’, and so it only makes sense that 
some of the techniques that helped them 
may not be as beneficial to my own life. 

COMMUNITY CULTURE PROFILE
Community culture artist profile: Kaitlyn Bondoni

The first thing LSA senior Kailyn 

Bondoni learned about poetry was that it 
rhymes. The second was that haikus existed. 
The third was that free verse also existed, 
which, in turn, erased the first lesson she 
learned.

Bondoni’s journey to artistic expression, 

particularly in poetry, began in her fourth 
grade classroom. Her teacher read and 
recited “Where the Sidewalk Ends” by Shel 
Silverstein. 

“He had this book fully marked up,” 

Bondoni told The Daily. “Then he just 
recited it from memory and spoke so fast. 
It was so intriguing and terrifying for some 
reason but like cool. Like when you say, ‘oh, 
you fear God’: that was this man. So much 
poetic power.” 

After Shel Silverstein came angst-driven 

poems in middle school and poems to aid 
emotional processing in high school. At the 

University, her time in the Lloyd Scholars 
for Writing and the Arts (LSWA) and her 
creative writing classes exposed her to the 
wider spectrum of poetry’s possibilities. 

“I originally thought of free verse and 

not having to rhyme as freedom,” Bondoni 
said. “Forms or rhyme scheme is its own 
challenge and talent that I don’t think I had 
enough respect for until coming into college 
and actually trying it.”

Now, Bondoni double majors in Film, TV 

and Media Studies and English with a sub-
concentration in Creative Writing, alongside 
minors in Writing and Environment. Her 
long list of interests pushed her to discover 
poetry’s playful malleability. 

Early in college, Bondoni took English 

223: Introduction to Creative Writing on a 
whim. Her LSA professor, Joseph Mahoney, 
encouraged her to pursue the poetry track 
of the English major’s creative writing 
concentration. This year, she will take 
English 428, the creative writing capstone, 
to finish her concentration. There, Bondoni 
hopes to write a poetry collection that traces 

her changing poetry and style over time, 
capturing her experiences from that fourth 
grade classroom to the present. 

LSWA also exposed Bondoni to poetry 

performance. She recalled her first reading 
as “an experience and a half,” full of shaking 
hands and shallow breaths. But by the end 
of her freshman year, poetry performance 
became a playful experience for her, an 
opportunity for laughter. At one memorable 
event, she donned a winter trapper hat and 
sunglasses and enlisted a friend to play the 
bongos from the Donkey Kong game.

“I think that was kind of the turning point 

where I was like, ‘okay, it’s not something 
that I have to be nervous for because I’m 
expressing,’” she said. “It can also just be a 
release of tension.”

That artistic release provides a welcome 

relief from the flurry of emotions that 
college brings. 

“It’s a good way of figuring out what 

I’m feeling,” Bondoni said. “In college you 
meet people and you’re thrown around 
emotionally. College is a washing machine 

that you have no control over; you are the 
last sock in the washing machine. As that 
sock, I find that poetry helps me kind of 
surface.” 

Though poetry may seem divergent 

or even in opposition to the visual nature 
of her Film degree, Bondoni finds their 
marriage in screenwriting. The first time 
that she fully saw the connection was 
actually over Twitter, when someone 
tweeted screenshots from Greta Gerwig’s 
“Little Women” script. The director is one of 
Bondoni’s biggest inspirations. 

“The way that she writes her action lines 

and the script itself was beautiful. Some 
of the lines just sounded poetic with just 
a couple of analogies and metaphors that 
would really allow an actor to sink their 
teeth into the script,” she said.

Bondoni 
realized 
that 
this 
poetic 

approach allows screenwriters to leave 
their creative mark. She quickly gravitated 
toward TV writing — “There’s so much 
more room for character development in 
there,” she said. “You can really see so many 

different angles, multiple characters, and 
that really is so attractive to me.” 

The playfulness of her poetry is not lost 

along the way: Finding shows that combine 
both heartfelt and comedic elements greatly 
appeals to her. Bill Hader’s “Barry” hit the 
right combination. 

“Shows like that really inspire me to try 

to write more of a real story with comedic 
elements. I think that’s really the target 
I’m planning to land on aiming for,” said 
Bondoni. 

Though asking a senior about their post-

graduation plans can often cause anxiety, 
Bondoni knows that the film industry path, 
though challenging, is one she’ll continue 
chasing. She plans on moving to Los Angeles 
and holding onto her current screenwriting 
internship as long as possible.

Pepe the Frog’s fall from 
grace in ‘Feels Good Man’

This 
review 
has 
taken 

longer to write than I, or my 
editors, expected. In the last 
few days my time has been 
spent digesting the insidious 
darkness that characterizes 
“Feels 
Good 
Man.” 
This 

documentary 
follows 
the 

tale of Pepe the Frog and the 
character-turned-meme’s 
journey to become a symbol 
of hate. But it is also a tale of 
depravity fueled by anonymity, 
of how social media is both a 
reflection and a perversion of 
real social life, and a chapter 
in the grand history of white 
nationalism in America. The 
very sour cherry atop this 
sundae of reckless hatred is 
the man behind the meme 
— Matt Furie, Pepe’s own 
Dr. Frankenstein — whose 
innocent 
cartoon 
was 

bastardized by the internet, 
shattering his psyche. “Feels 
Good Man” is not for the faint 
of heart. I am left questioning 
my own “stamina” in the face 
of hatred. 

Furie 
created 
Pepe 
in 

2005 for his “Boy’s Club” 
comic. The lanky frog was an 
innocuous character with one 
particularly peculiar habit: He 
peed with his pants around his 
ankles. When questioned about 
this idiosyncrasy, Pepe could 
only say “feels good man.” How 
did a cartoon frog’s bathroom 
habits make the character an 
icon for the alt-right? For that, 
we can blame the internet.

Pepe’s 
circuitous 
journey 

into internet hell really began 
on 4chan, where anonymous 

users jockeyed for a spot at the 
top of one of the site’s message 
boards by eliciting reactions 
from 
their 
peers. 
This 

feature of 4chan meant that 
provocativeness was valuable. 
To be number one, you had to 
garner attention and incite a 
reaction. This will spell Pepe’s 
downfall.

The documentary features 

a few 4chan users, who share 
that 
they 
saw 
themselves 

in Pepe; their own peculiar 
habits, embodied by the self-
proclaimed 
moniker 
NEET 

(Not in Education, Employment 
or Training), made them “feel 
good,” too. Pepe represented 
an 
internet 
counterculture, 

those who felt rejected by 
mainstream society.

The problems began when 

Pepe memes leaked out of 4chan 
and onto Instagram, Facebook 
and other mainstream social 
media. Pepe had been taken by 
“normies,” the socially well-
adjusted people who are seen 
to represent the oppressors 
of NEETs, the relegation of 
the less well-adjusted to a 
lesser social status. So, while 
4chan users had already been 
making Pepe a provocateur, 
to 
keep 
“normies” 
from 

stealing the symbol of the 
counterculture, and to prevent 
Pepe from gaining mainstream 
recognition, the memes had to 
be so offensive and distasteful 
that no one would dare touch 
Pepe again.

All told, a group of people 

who felt they were being 
actively kept at the bottom 
rung of society now had a 
tool to push back. And by 
pasting their virulent racist 
rhetoric atop a cartoon frog, 

they made real bigotry into a 
joke. Fighting Pepe would be 
farcical, because it was “just 
a meme.” Hillary Clinton was 
lambasted 
by 
the 
alt-right 

for doing precisely this. This 
twisted irony is at the center 
of 
Pepe’s 
most 
despicable 

associations.

When “smug Pepe,” a meme 

in which the frog touches 
his chin and dons a sinister 
smirk, made its rounds, people 
compared it to Trump’s mug 
on the cover of GQ in 1984 and 
the association between then-
candidate Trump and Pepe 
was solidified. Trump-Pepe 
memes became more common, 
with Trump himself tweeting 
an illustration of himself as 
the racist frog. As Trump’s 
policies began to interact with 
the 
meme-ing 
provocateurs 

on 4chan, Pepe’s status as a 
genuine symbol of the alt-right 
was undeniable. 

One of the documentary’s 

more prominent interviewees 
is Susan Blackmore, scholar 
and author of “The Meme 
Machine,” a text exploring 
Richard Dawkins’s memetic 
theory. 
Blackmore 
believes, 

in short, that ideas are spread 
autonomously by human “meme 
machines.” Like evolutionary 
gene theory, in which the 
stronger 
biological 
traits 

outlast and supersede weaker 
ones, meme theory says that 
certain ideas will outlast and 
overpower others. Blackmore 
says that “culture … is more 
like a vast parasite growing 
and living and feeding on us 
than a tool of our creation.” 
In other words, culture is 
memes, shared by humans in 
the form of language, religion, 

art and Pepe. For Blackmore, 
memes share themselves. She 
doesn’t address this in the 
documentary; however, I am 
curious if she would ascribe 
any culpability to the millions 
of people who have created and 
shared offensive Pepe images 
in the decade or so since he 
took the internet by storm.

While images may share 

themselves by way of the 
human 
“meme 
machine” 

mind, this transmission can 
certainly be manipulated and 
directed. Another remarkable 
interviewee is a former Trump 
campaign official who spoke 
matter-of-factly 
about 
the 

campaign’s use of social media 
to win support. In criticizing 
Matt 
Furie’s 
#SavePepe 

quest 
in 
partnership 
with 

the Anti-Defamation League 
to reclaim the meme, this 
former 
campaign 
official 

suggested that Furie failed to 
understand the internet and its 
machinations. In many ways, 
this campaign official is right: 
#SavePepe backfired, and the 
Peace, Love and Pepe memes 
were co-opted and swiftly 

desecrated. 

In 
a 
September 
2016 

interview with Adam Serwer 
for The Atlantic (who is also 
featured in the film), Furie says 
“I think that’s it’s just a phase, 
and come November, it’s just 
gonna go on to the next phase 
… in terms of meme culture, 
it’s 
people 
reappropriating 

things for their own agenda. 
That’s just a product of the 
internet.” It seems Furie takes 
a view similar to Blackmore’s 
of memetics and acknowledges 
the entropic character of the 
internet. What’s unsettling, 
though, is Furie’s confidence 
that white nationalism would 
all go away.

If this country has seen 

anything in the four years since 
Furie’s interview with Serwer, 
it is that hatred is not “just a 
phase.” The very foundation of 
our society is constructed from 
inequity and bigotry. In this 
moment of reckoning, we must 
be hyper-aware of the “jokes,” 
because 
hatred 
masked 
as 

humor is insidious.

The film is not entirely 

without hope. Pepe has been 

taken up by protestors in 
Hong Kong as a symbol of 
love. Alex Jones of InfoWARS 
settled out of court with Furie 
after Pepe’s creator sued the 
vicious 
conspiracy 
theorist 

for 
copyright 
infringement. 

Furie, 
whose 
sadness 
and 

guilt are upsettingly palpable 
throughout 
the 
film, 
has 

moved onto new projects. His 
art is really something. 

Despite 
developments 
in 

Hong Kong, a recent expedition 
to 4chan showed me that in the 
U.S., Pepe is beyond salvation. 
But our democracy is not. As 
we continue to fight hatred in 
America, pay close attention 
to the potentially dangerous 
power of the meme, especially 
wielded 
by 
anonymous 

idealogues. This summer of 
organizing and resistance has 
shown that the internet can 
be a potent force for good and 
change. Let us embrace this in 
the hopes that we might shift 
the tide of memetics in our 
favor. And for the love of Pepe, 
VOTE.

Raised by RuneScape: my 
extremely online childhood

When I describe myself as being 

“extremely online” to my friends, 
they usually agree — they too 
love memes and spend hours on 
Twitter.

Trying to clarify what I mean 

gets messy. It usually turns into 
some form of me reciting my own 
version of Bane’s quote from “The 
Dark Knight Rises”: “You merely 
adopted the internet; I was born in 
it, molded by it.”

If I was molded by the internet, 

“RuneScape” was the pair of hands 
that shaped me.

By the time I reached third 

grade, I was in the internet 
trenches. Deep in the trenches. 
I’m talking roleplaying “Pokémon” 
on 
fansite 
forums, 
watching 

Naruto fan flash animations on 
Saiyan Island, trying to learn the 
dance 
from 
“Caramelldansen” 

and consuming dozens of Strong 
Bad emails on Homestar Runner. 
According to the record books, 
June 21, 2007 was the first time 
I logged into RuneScape. I spent 
the first of what would become 
thousands of hours glued to the 
computer. If “Pokémon” roleplay 
and Naruto fan flashes were the 
trenches, “RuneScape” was my 
ninth circle of digital hell.

For 
the 
uninitiated, 

“RuneScape” is an MMORPG 
(Massively 
Multiplayer 
Online 

Role-Playing Game), an open world 
fantasy multiplayer game where 
you play alongside thousands of 
other players. If you’ve ever played 
“World of Warcraft” or “Club 
Penguin,” you’ve played an MMO. 
They have an emphasis on social 
interaction, with in-game guilds 
and virtual economies. It’s the 
social aspect of “RuneScape” that 
shaped me most — where I learned 
everything from politics and pop 
culture, to learning what sex was 
and finding out Santa isn’t real.

As a young kid hooked on 

fantasy, “RuneScape” triggered 
all the right neurotransmitters in 
my brain. I could practice archery 
and slay dragons and do quests 
day and night. I loved the grind of 
mining coal or fishing for lobsters 
ad infinitum, selling them for gold 
and buying fashionable clothes 
for my character to wear while 
mining and fishing. Whenever I 
leveled up in “RuneScape,” a little 
animation of fireworks would 
display over my character; I can 
still feel that dopamine rush. My 
favorite thing to do was chat with 
other players while training — I 
would usually juggle three or four 
conversations at once. Meanwhile, 
back on planet Earth, I was going 
days without stepping outside. I 
rarely opened my mouth. Messages 
on “RuneScape” could be my only 

social interaction for days.

Before long, I grew so deeply 

immersed into my online identity 
that there was Dylan and then 
there 
was 
Smallbones25, 
my 

“RuneScape” username. By fourth 
grade I genuinely didn’t have a real-
life friend, but that never bothered 
me. I had friends in noodleboy12, 
a friend met fishing on the docks 
in Karamja, and Vortex King, 
a “RuneScape” veteran I met 
training in the Warrior’s Guild. My 
social life got even better when I 
adopted the alter-ego of a 17-year-
old girl named Kendra. When 
your character is a girl in a male-
dominated video game, friendship 
and conversation online come easy. 

Somewhere down the line my 

dad picked up on the unnatural 
amount of time I spent on my 
computer 
and 
the 
extreme 

emotional 
investment 
I 
had 

in “RuneScape.” As a parent, 
I can’t imagine how shameful 
and disappointing it must have 
felt 
when 
your 
eight-year-old 

son with no friends came to you 
bawling his eyes out because he 
got scammed in a video game or 
accidentally died and lost all his 
virtual possessions. It crossed the 
line when I started staying up too 
late and sleeping in on school days. 
My dad started cutting the internet 
on my computer at 7:30 p.m. on 
school nights. The first night I 
staged a pseudo-strike outside his

office, demanding my internet be 
reinstated. He ignored my futile 
protests, so I adapted. At 7:30 I 
would go to sleep for the night, and 
when the internet turned back on 
at 5 in the morning, I woke up to 
play “RuneScape” before school.

For a long time I was content 

with “RuneScape,” a constant in 
my life I didn’t know how to live 
without. Then puberty hit in sixth 
or seventh grade and my virtual 
friends were no longer enough for 
me. I started to acknowledge my 
hobby as an addiction. I started to 
recognize my lack of real 
friends as an inadequacy, a 
personal failure. I wanted 
to be one of the “cool kids,” 
and those kids were talking 
to girls on Facebook and 
wearing fake Gucci Belts, 
not slaying dragons on 
“RuneScape.” If I wanted 
to be cool, I’d have to quit 
“RuneScape” and instead 
play “Call of Duty” with 
them and drop slurs on 
Xbox Live.

I 
quit 
“RuneScape” 

cold turkey. For the next 
few years I dreaded and 
resented 
the 
addictive 

game upon which I built 
my prepubescent social life. 
Making friends in middle school 
felt like a desperate attempt to 
catch up on what I missed out on 
for so long. In the deepest pits of my 
eighth-grade depression, I blamed 
“RuneScape” for my complete 
lack of social skills and feared 
it for its life-shattering power. I 
clocked in over 2,000 hours on my 
main “RuneScape” account and 
easily thousands more that went 
uncounted, and what did it give 
me?

I thought: “RuneScape” doesn’t 

give, it only takes. Mostly, I thought 
“RuneScape” 
took 
away 
my 

childhood. I’d find myself thinking 
things like, if I’d spent all that time 
playing sports, I could be the star 
of the football team. When I heard 
people talk about their childhood 
memories and childhood friends, it 
would trigger a depressive episode 
that lasted hours. My childhood 
memories placed me in a dark room 
in front of a screen for hours on end. 
“I will never have a childhood,” 
echoed through my skull.

I’d made some friends in middle 

school and tried to do more 
“normal” things like joining the 
track team or going to the mall, 
but with social skills built on the 
internet, face-to-face interaction 
felt like a losing battle in my 
head. I frantically advertised my 
dedication to fashion as my new-

found “cool” hobby. I needed a 
way to distinguish Dylan, the 
cool track runner fashionista, 
from Smallbones25, the internet-
addicted dweeb.

Naively I thought I was alone 

in living my life online. Even after 
I quit “RuneScape,” I just dumped 
the same amount of time into new 
outlets like playing “Minecraft” or 
making friends on anime fansites. 
I was caught somewhere between 
wishing I could leave it all behind to 
become a “cool kid” and wishing all 
those people I met on “RuneScape” 

or “Minecraft” or anime fansites 
could be real. It never clicked that 
there were real life people behind 
all those “RuneScape” avatars.

One day during a discussion in 

English class, I dropped an anime 
reference in front of the class. As 
soon as I let it slip I shut myself 
up — I’d accidentally let a little bit 
of Smallbones25 out. It didn’t seem 
like anybody noticed, though.

Somebody noticed.
Sitting alone at lunch always 

made me uncomfortable, so I 
would always eat in the library. 
The library was where the “nerds” 
hung out until fourth period. One 
of those nerds was in my English 
class. He saw through the fashion-
runner-boy and knew I was hiding 
Smallbones25 beneath. Gradually 
he lured me in and inducted me 
into his nerd circle. 

I’d made real friends in the 

last two years since I’d quit 
“RuneScape” and tried to start 
over, but for the first time in my 
life I had friends I could be myself 
around. They were different. They 
didn’t play sports. They didn’t talk 
to girls. They didn’t give a shit 
about my Air Jordans. But they 
watched videogamedunkey and 
played “Dungeons & Dragons” and 
they were always three steps ahead 
of the meme curve from constantly 
browsing 4chan. They too were 

born on the internet. They even 
played MMOs!

The library nerd circle developed 

into a close-knit crew that would be 
some of the only friends of mine to 
persist after high school. We played 
games online together, yeah, but we 
also did the same kinds of things I 
would have done with considerably 
more “normal” friends, like going 
to the movie theater or talking 
about school. Something about the 
backdrop of a shared childhood 
spent in front of screens made 
those normal things feel so much 

more genuine, like our 
brains were all tuned to the 
same frequency.

A small part of me still 

feared “RuneScape” for a 
long time, but by the time 
college rolled around I was 
breathing nostalgia for it. 
Watching my friends play 
MMOs like “Path of Exile” 
or “Final Fantasy XIV” was 
encouraging. I finally had a 
reckoning with RuneScape 
when I logged into old 
school “RuneScape” for the 
first time in seven years, 
a perfect recreation of the 
game that first sucked 
me into the abyss back in 
2007. It wrapped me up in 

excitement just like it did when I 
was a kid, but in a new, healthier 
way. Old friends like noodleboy12 
and Vortex King were long gone, but 
new friends took their place. Most 
of the player base is also nostalgic 
adults, and reminiscing about a 
childhood built on “RuneScape” is 
a staple conversation in old school. 
Like me, many of them balanced 
school, work, hobbies and a social 
life. I spent a couple months in the 
summer getting my fill of nostalgia 
and then naturally drifted from 
the game when school came back 
around.

I still wish I went outside and 

talked to real people a lot more 
than I did when I was a kid, but I 
wouldn’t 
remove 
“RuneScape” 

from my life story. The game didn’t 
just take — it gave a lot back. It 
gave back in small ways, like all 
the weird quirks embedded in 
my personality. I have a knack 
for napkin math from always 
calculating my experience points 
and levels. I chatted so much on 
“RuneScape” that I learned to type 
fast — so absurdly fast that I’ve 
never met anyone faster. I also spent 
years accidentally spelling things 
in British English (“RuneScape” is 
a British game).

I 

put my fingers on 

the scanning screen 

for the third time, as 

the machine was unable to 

recognize my fingerprints. 

After finally succeeding, I 

quickly put my mask back on 

as my fingers fumbled with 

my immigration documents.

“Please come with me,” 

a U.S. Customs and Bor-

der Protection officer sig-

naled in my direction after 

I passed the Canadian bor-

der into the United States, 

proceeding to walk me to a 
door on the side of the hall. 

I sat alone on the bench and 

waited for about 10 minutes 

before another officer came 

into the room and sat beside 

me. 

In a calm manner, she 

asked me a series of person-

al questions: What were my 

private and school emails, 

what was my American ad-

dress, how much cash I was 

carrying and lastly, “Do you 

have WeChat?” 

WeChat is a multipur-

pose, Chinese social media 

application. Many people refer 

to it as China’s equivalent of WhatsApp, 

but with greater bandwidth. The services 

WeChat offers include, but are not limited 

to, e-transferring, mobile payments, or-

dering food at a restaurant without wait-

ers, online shopping and location sharing. 

Recently, due to WeChat’s role in China’s 

oversea censorship and spreading propa-

gandistic misinformation, the Trump ad-

ministration has denounced the app as a 

national security threat and proposed its 

ban in the United States.

I reluctantly gave the officer my infor-

mation. Though recently many Chinese 

international students have been sub-

jected to harassment and interrogation 

at Customs and Border Protection, I was 

completely caught off guard by their line 

of questioning. I am not a Chinese citizen, 

but a Canadian one — the only indication 

of my Chinese heritage is my name and a 

stamp on my passport showing I had trav-

eled there last summer. In that moment, 

my sense of surprise was overcome by fear 

and anxiety about my alien status in the 

U.S. Do I really belong?

The officer then put the notepad away 

and went into the back room for a pair of 

gloves, her demeanor seemingly pleasant 

but her actions and questions intrusive. 

She unpacked all of the pockets in my 

backpack, my pencil case, my wallet (and 

counted the cash) and my immigration 

files. She pointed at the Hangul characters 

in my notebook and asked “Is that Manda-

rin?” She was startled after I told her that 

it was actually Korean, a language I was 

trying to learn, and moved on with her 

search. She left in a haste after thoroughly 

probing all of my belongings. When alone, 

I realized that my legs were shaking. 
T

ensions between the U.S. and 

China escalated during the 

trade war of late 2018. Though 

economic pressures from both sides had 

calmed after a series of negotiations, more 

conflicts ensued in mid-February, when 

China expelled three Wall Street Journal 

reporters in the name of a racially insensi-

tive headline: “China Is the Real Sick Man 

of Asia” — a phrase that carries strong un-

dertones of European colonial history in 

China.

Though the reason for expulsion may 

be justified, this measure only provoked 

further retaliations — like limited staff 

for five Chinese news organizations in the 

U.S. — from the Trump administration. 

After China passed the National Security 

Law, which significantly infringes upon 

Hong Kong’s democracy, the Trump ad-

ministration responded by ending Hong 

Kong’s preferential trade status with the 

U.S. and China vowed to retaliate. In late 

July, the U.S. had also shut down the Chi-

nese Consulate in Houston, accusing it 

of espionage efforts. As a direct result, 

the American Consulate in Chengdu was 

ordered to close within a 72-hour time 

frame.

When the pandemic first started taking 

shape in the U.S., fear and ignorance about 

the virus fueled an increased sentiment of 

xenophobia. Asians have been assaulted 

on public transit and called “diseased,” 

and Chinese businesses in New York City 

reported an approximate 40% sales drop 

while Boston’s Chinatown had also suf-

fered significant customer loss after the 

first COVID-19 case was confirmed in 

Massachusetts.

As U.S.-China tensions escalate, Chi-

nese nationals tend to become the most 

vulnerable subjects of discrimination. 

Therefore, I spoke* to three Chinese in-

ternational students about how they are 

persevering and navigating their lives in a 

country that does not want them.

*The following interviews were conduct-

ed in Mandarin Chinese, for the most effec-

tive and genuine form of communication, 

and translated into English.

**The following interviewee 

uses a pseudonym for fear of re-

taliation from the University.

It was one minute past our meeting 

time at 7 p.m. when Julia entered the 

Zoom meeting. She was sitting at her 

desk in her shared apartment near central 

campus. Throughout our conversations, I 

could hear loud bass music coming from 

her side and the occasional roaring motor-

cycles passing by.

“Do you ever hear parties like that 

where you live?” Julia smiled exasperat-

edly, “We get that all the time.”

Julia is a Chinese international student 

who just transferred to the University of 

Michigan last September. Julia made the 

choice to stay in Ann Arbor when classes 

moved online because she did not want to 

contract COVID-19 on her way home. She 

has stayed in the U.S. for more than nine 

months as the last time she went home 

was for Winter Break.

Coming to the U.S. was a big decision 

for her, but Julia wanted new possibilities 

in life and to challenge herself. Julia’s col-

lege experience has largely been positive, 

as she met many people who shared her 

passions in her program. But when the vi-

rus spread through the world last March, 

she began to develop a deeper under-

standing of racism and xenophobia on the 

campus that she made her home.

According to Pew Research Center, 

31% of Asian Ameircans and 21% of Black 

Americans report having experienced ra-

cial slurs and jokes since the COVID-19 

outbreak began. When I told Julia that 

earlier this year people would turn around 

to look at me while I’d speak on the phone 

with my mom in Chinese, Julia confessed 

that she has felt similar aversion and con-

fusion from others.

“A white girl once told my friend dur-

ing class ‘it’s the Chinese who brought 

the virus here,’” Julia recounted. “I was 

so shocked to learn this from my friend. 

Apparently the girl said it so blatantly in 

front of a lot of students, and I found that 

quite rude.” 

Born into a racially homogenous home-

land (Han Chinese makes up 91% of Chi-

nese population), Julia said that she did 

not start thinking seriously about racial 

issues until after she moved to the United 

States. She told me she was particularly 

influenced by a sociology course she took 

this past summer, where the professor in-

vited speakers from different ethnic back-

grounds to share their experiences with 

race.

“That’s when I had an epiphany, that 

the color of your skin could dictate how 

others perceive you.” 

Despite her unpleasant experience 

with xenophobia, Julia told me that she is 

still interested in pursuing her postgradu-

ate studies in the U.S. However, she can 

also foresee the increased discrimination 

and retaliation that she might face as U.S.-

China relations aggravate, such as further 

limited opportunities for international 

students and drastic changes in visa poli-

cies. 

As one of the U.S.’s most profitable ex-

ports, higher-education institutions have 

always relied on their international stu-

dents to make up for budget gaps. Nev-

ertheless, many American colleges have 

already observed a sharp decline in Chi-

nese international student 

enrollment rates prior to the 

pandemic. As the Trump ad-

ministration continues to en-

force travel restrictions and 

other policies that restrict 

work 
opportunities 
from 

international students, the 

road ahead appears uncer-

tain. For now, though, Julia 

is willing to risk this uncer-

tainty for her education.

“Now I just miss home 

cooked food.” Julia smiled 

again, this time not exasper-

atedly. “I have a lot of friends 
who went to the Shanghai 

Disneyland already and I am 

super jealous.”
S

huchen:

On a warm Satur-

day afternoon, I met 

with Shuchen Wei on Zoom, 

me in my East Quad Resi-

dence Hall room and she in 

her off-campus apartment. 

Shuchen is currently in her 

last year at the University of 

Michigan, and she chose to 

stay in Ann Arbor in March 

in fear that further U.S.-Chi-

na tensions could keep her 

stuck in China and meddle with 

her graduation plans. 

“It has been a year since I last went 

home and I really miss my parents,” 

Shuchen said. “But if I go back (to China), 

attending synchronous lectures would 

disrupt my sleep cycles.”

Shuchen told me that homesickness 

is not an unfamiliar feeling for her, since 

she has repeatedly thought about going 

home as COVID-19 cases were increas-

ing at an unprecedented pace in the U.S. 

She was also concerned about the armed 

demonstrations in East Lansing in protest 

of Governor Whitmer’s stay-at-home or-

ders, seeing it as a sign of the U.S.’s poor 

pandemic strategies. However, booking a 

flight home was no easy feat: In March, 

3,102 out of 3,800 planned commercial 

flights from and to China were canceled. 

China had also restricted many interna-

tional flights to prevent their own citizens 

from bringing the virus home.

Additionally, on July 6, the U.S. Immi-

gration and Customs Enforcement issued 

a new policy (now revoked after backlash 

from various prestigious universities) that 

would have stripped international stu-

dents of their visas if their coursework 

were entirely online. This also generated 

great anxieties among Chinese students 

about their immigration status and fears 

of never being able to return to their in-

stitutions.

“After the ICE policy first came out, 

a lot of my classmates who returned to 

China for the summer panicked,” Shuchen 

explained. “I know of some people who 

planned to quarantine in Cambodia for 

14 days and then make their flight back. 

There were a lot of flight cancellations but 

some tickets did not offer refunds, which 

was also stressful financially.”

More so, U.S. government officials have 

recommended excluding Chinese stu-

dents from critical technology disciplines 

to prevent espionage efforts, while Chi-

nese international students have faced 

increasing scrutiny while passing through 

Customs and Border Protection. These 

policies have since turned many Chinese 

students and researchers away from pur-

suing their education here in the future. 

Shuchen

W

hat does it mean to live in a 

community? 

In one sense, a commu-

nity is a group of people who have something 

in common. When I reflect on what I have in 

common with my fellow students, faculty and 

staff, two things come to mind. The first is our 

affiliation with the University of Michigan. 

The mere fact of affiliation, however, confers 

little significance within Ann Arbor. Meeting 

a fellow Wolverine in your hometown or on a 

trip abroad is exciting, yet here, our Wolverine-

ness tends to fade into the background. The 

school swells with spirit on game days, but in 

the course of daily life meeting another Wol-

verine is so common that it ceases to be special.

Another aspect of our community is that we 

share a common space and engage with each 

other within it. We meet our peers in this neu-

tral territory so that we can form bonds and 

foster relationships of trust that lead to deeper 

social connections. From the buzz of the Diag 

to the roar of the Big House, the activities that 

bind the individual to the community invari-

ably take place in the presence of others. Leav-

ing the privacy of one’s home is crucial to at-

taining this newfound sense of belonging.

It is this second aspect — our interaction in 

public spaces — that is the greatest determinant 

of our sense of community. When people say, 

“I went to the University of Michigan,” they do 

not simply refer to receiving their degree. It is 

rather a question of being there; memories of 

screaming in the students’ section, getting lost 

in Angell Hall and hustling to class in sub-zero 

temperatures linger in the minds of U-M stu-

dents years after graduation. In a similar vein, 

the invaluable work of faculty and staff ensures 

that this environment is preserved for current 

students as well as the generations of students 

to come.

However, this semester COVID-19 has 

forced us to adapt to an unfamiliar social re-

ality. Reflecting on the possible 

ramifications of this adaptation, 

I began to wonder: How did we 

interact historically in public 

spaces here at the University, 

and how have these interac-

tions changed in the time of CO-

VID-19?

In probing this question, I 

decided to examine three kinds 

of public spaces in particu-

lar: dining halls, libraries and 

“crossroads,” places students 

walk through or spend a few 

hours in doing a variety of ac-

tivities, such as the Diag or the 

Law Quadrangle.
B

efore the pandem-

ic, Michigan Din-

ing hosted thousands 

of students per day in seven 

public dining halls and two, 

Martha Cook Dining Hall and 

the Lawyer’s Club, designated as 

“residents only.” MDining is also 

the top student employer on 

campus, with approximately 

1,000 jobs offered each term. 

The amount of food produced and consumed 

in all of these places combined was and still is 

staggering — anyone who has relied on the din-

ing hall system in their college career should 

pause to quietly applaud this herculean effort.

For MDining, the act of feeding thousands 

of students has stayed the same. The experi-

ence of going to the dining hall, however, has 

changed a lot.

Dining hall student coordinator and LSA se-

nior Alethia Blough told me in our Zoom call 

about the major differences in dining before 

and during the pandemic. She works in South 

Quad Dining Hall, where the old system of 

grabbing food from different mini-restaurants 

has given way to a highly organized series of 

socially-distanced lines. There is no more eat-

ing in the dining hall, either; students enter the 

dining hall, join one of the lines and are finally 

spit out at the exit.

“We’re definitely trying to keep things more 

enforced and be a more known presence, just 

to direct the lines and things like that. And so 

(students) kind of have to interact with us. They 

can’t just grab their plate and go.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, the necessity 

of the situation has decreased spontaneous 

interactions among students and introduced 

required interactions between student diners 

and employees. This is a clear, even encourag-

ing caveat to any categorical denunciation of 

COVID-19 damaging all social relations. As has 

been the case for many other essential workers, 

the pandemic has shown the importance of peo-

ple that previously students might have taken 

for granted. Moreover, as cases climb in dormi-

tories across campus, fostering trust between 

workers and diners is more important than ever.

When I spoke with Aidan Meador-Woodruff, 

an LSA Residential College freshman, on the 

phone to get the student perspective on the din-

ing hall experience, one of the first things he ex-

pressed was an appreciation for the kindness of 

dining hall workers. “The people who greet us at 

the dining hall and the actual staff are very kind 

in their interactions with students,” Meador-

Woodruff said.

And these small, everyday interactions 

count for a lot in a time when the coronavirus 

pandemic also threatens an epidemic of loneli-

ness for new students. However well people get 

along in the contemporary dining hall experi-

ence, it is no substitute for the vital social func-

tion dining halls have played in previous years 

— the possibility of sharing a meal with friends 

in these common spaces was crucial for devel-

oping a sense of connection among students. 

Especially as the temperature drops, residence 

hall residents — and anyone who lives alone — 

will have to reckon with fewer opportunities to 

break bread with their peers.
T

he library is another focal point of 

public life that has drastically al-

tered its operations. As physical 

spaces, the many U-M libraries have offered 

generations of students a sanctuary for academ-

ic study. Unlike with the Union, the Fishbowl 

and other serious academic hubs, the library is 

not only a study space; it also holds a vast reposi-

tory of knowledge. The whole apparatus of the 

library — both physical and virtual — is directed 

toward the goal of supporting scholars from all 

disciplines across the university.

This semester, most libraries at the Univer-

sity have temporarily closed in observances of 

public health guidelines, yet librarians are still 

working hard to replace the loss of in-person 

access to the physical spaces. I got to hear more 

about these efforts when I talked with two li-

brarians over Zoom: Emily Petty Puckett Rodg-

ers, a space design and assessment librarian who 

also leads the Library Environments depart-

ment, and Dr. Rebecca Price, a subject specialist 

for architecture and urban planning.

As the lead of the Library Environments de-

partment, Puckett Rogers conducts research on 

how patrons engage with the physical, and now 

virtual, spaces of the library. She told me about 

some of the new services the library was testing 

out, such as specialist virtual consultations, con-

tactless pickup and continued access to the spe-

cial collections. “I think that we are responding 

to some of these challenges in ways that try to 

place us at the point of need for people,” Puckett 

Rogers explained. 

It is clear that Puckett Rogers and her team, 

along with the hundreds of employees of the 

U-M library, are continuing to earnestly support 

researchers here at the University in the vir-

tual environment. What has been temporarily 

lost, however, is the experience of being in the 

library. Price illustrated the nature of this expe-

rience well in our conversation.

“
Just being near all the ideas that are in 

those books; you have, sort of, conversations. 

People are talking to you — that sounds really 

scary.” At this point Price paused and laughed 

at herself. “But when you’re in the library there 

are these conversations going on all the time 

that you can be part of.”

This is an evocative description of what is 

special about libraries, though I think Price’s 

notion of being near the ideas also points the 

way to a broader truth. When you go to a li-

brary, “the ideas” are not only sitting on dusty 

shelves — they also exist in the minds of ev-

eryone around you. At any given moment, the 

vast majority of people working in libraries are 

wrestling with concepts, proofs, code, essays or 

whatever they happen to be working on. They 

do so privately in their own minds, but publicly 

in the act of writing, typing and talking. In ad-

dition to the ghostly conversations happening 

between writers and readers, actual conver-

sations also take place between the budding 

scholars of the future. 

Puckett Rogers described the library as an 

“intellectual collision space.” That might be an 

oddly chaotic image for a place usually reserved 

for quiet contemplation, although the second 

floor of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library is 

a notable exception. At the level of ideas, how-

ever, collisions do occur. Even in the silence of 

the Law Library, one can constantly hear the 

frenetic pitter-patter of fingers on a keyboard. 

Collisions are happening everywhere.
L

ast but not least, I reflected on the 

character of the thoroughfares of 

campus: places like the Diag and the 

Law Quad.

The Diag is the most “public” of all the 

spaces addressed in this article. It is a com-

mon byway for practically everyone, ranging 

from seasoned townies to fans of the opposing 

team on game days. The student population, 

however, still probably provides the majority 

of foot traffic. Indeed, in the time before virtual 

learning, I traversed the Diag every day, which 

is the case for most students. For this reason, I 

assumed it would mark the cornerstone of the 

community; it would represent our sense of to-

getherness.

Yet, I have started to notice something trou-

bling about the character of daily life in Ann 

Arbor. It is not the fact that people keep their 

distance from each other — this is a good thing, 

albeit an unfortunate truth of following public 

health guidelines. It’s also not about my frus-

tration with people not wearing masks — this 

has been a problem since the beginning of the 

pandemic. 

I have noticed that, with regard to how we 

treat each other, not much has changed at all.

I arrived at this understanding while I was 

sitting on the Law Quad. It was a beautiful au-

tumn day, and lots of people had come out to 

relax or do schoolwork on the lawn. The scene 

was eerily normal. There was something famil-

iar about how people were simply leaving each 

other alone. It was then that I realized that CO-

VID-19 has given us an opportunity to ignore 

each other even more intensely than before.

Though we may not like to admit it, ignoring 

each other is an integral part of the culture of 

our campus. It’s rare to receive a smile from a 

passerby on the way to class, unless you know 

them. At bars, people tend to keep to their cir-

cle of friends. In the few minutes before class 

begins, as people are unpacking notebooks and 

their pencil cases, no one is in the mood for a 

conversation. At a school as competitive as 

Michigan, people are too busy, distracted, tired 

or stressed to truly dedicate time and curiosity 

to the well-being of strangers.

To be fair, this cultural practice is in no 

way unique to the University of Michigan. In 

all large cities and towns, there comes a point 

when it is cumbersome to actively acknowl-

edge the existence of everyone you see. In-

stead, minding your own business becomes the 

predominant attitude.

I think that is why there are so many smaller 

communities at the University. The innumera-

ble fraternities, sororities, pre-professional fra-

ternities, consulting groups, a capella groups, 

interest groups, clubs and even the student 

newspaper contribute to a sense of community 

that is much stronger than what mere univer-

sity affiliation can provide. Students in these 

organizations care about each other, make last-

ing friendships and in some cases do incredible 

things with a group of diverse, 

like-minded individuals.

It is clear, however, that car-

ing for a smaller community 

does not always translate to 

caring for the U-M community 

as a whole. People who are con-

scious of COVID-19 keep their 

distance and wear a mask, ef-

fectively “ignoring” you, but 

they do so because it is in the 

interest of the community; they 

acknowledge that others’ health 

is important to them.

On the contrary, I am not 

sure what I can say about the 

person who walks the streets 
without a mask, spits on the 

ground and does not apologize 

for either. This person clearly 

does not know me, and he does 

not care about me. Like all of 

us, he pays attention to what he 

finds significant. I do not think 

there is any mystery involved in 

his behavior, nor an interesting 

psychological problem. He sim-

ply does not give a damn.
T

he paradox of COVID-19 is that 

building a real community requires 

meaningful and sustained inter-

action, while at the same it is currently in the 

interest of the broader community for us to re-

main temporarily apart. 

In terms of how we conduct ourselves in the 

public sphere, we can learn much from their 

stewards such as dining hall employees and li-

brarians. They ensure the continued function 

of essential services, as well as the spaces in 

which those services are rendered. They can-

not afford to ignore others as a part of their job, 

but the truth is that neither can we.

Our lives are becoming increasingly private, 

but in those rare moments when we are in pub-

lic we must tread carefully. Personal respon-

sibility will not be enough; what is currently 

missing in the weakly-bound communities 

across the United States is a sense of the col-

lective. Only when we are able to acknowledge 

the existence of others will we recognize the 

deprivations of unmitigated self-interest and 

the virtues of living in the public sphere.

Take a seat

BY TAYLOR SCHOTT, STATEMENT CONTRIBUTOR

H

ave you ever tried to count 

all of the benches in Nichols 

Arboretum? I tried once and 

have only an estimate to show for it: 72. 

Though I know that an estimate is bet-

ter than nothing, better than not trying 

at all and better than letting that curios-

ity fade into the recesses of a cluttered 

mind, I still wish to know the exact num-

ber, not just an insecure estimate. Pecu-

liarity aside, indulging in that kind of cu-

riosity, and in nature, is more necessary 

than most college students realize. 

The Arb does not feel like the rest of 

Ann Arbor; it is out of place, but neces-

sarily so. Because of the discordance be-

tween the hallowed columns of campus 

and the gentle green of the Arb, the lat-

ter becomes a kind of sanctuary. 

Spend too much time there, though, 

and you’ll begin to fixate on odd particu-

larities: every different way to describe 

how the wind moves through the leaves, 

which exact hue of green it is that the 

slanting shadows create on the grass or 

wondering if those who have engraved 

“in memory” instead of “in loving memo-

ry” on the bench plaques love their dead 

less than those who chose to engrave the 

latter. It is important, then, to become 

acutely aware of what is indulgence and 

what is obsession — a differentiation 

that can seem outwardly obvious but is 

inwardly murky. 

Like many students, I’ll run in the Arb, 

but only if my schedule requires quick-

ness, or if I figure that my complexion 

could use some circulatory rouge. I’ll 

sail down the gravel paths toward the 

Huron River, the downhill working for 

me, my legs just carrying out the task. 

Each step that connects with the gravel 

is immediately satisfying, that crunch, 

rapid breath and a pulsating chest.

But if time allows, I walk through the 

Arb with languor. I also bring a bag be-

cause the bag can hold paper and pens to 

record notes like:

“Are those chickadees? Tiny birds ei-

ther way.” 

“Overhead on path, ‘We weren’t plan-

ning on coming here and then we did.’”

“Construction materials but no crew = 

lunch break?”

Entering the Arb off Geddes Road — 

the entrance with the stout iron gates 

— I begin to wind through a short path 

with crowding shrubbery and sporadic 

yellow flowers that look like banana pep-

pers when you cross your eyes just right. 

Past the flower-peppers, I reach the first 

overlook, two benches which abut each 

other on a soggy plot of land. As I sit, 

they provide a faraway view of the North 

Campus clock tower, the one that looks 

like a futuristic hairbrush. I told a friend 

once that you could see North Campus 

from these overlook benches, and she 

scrunched her face in disgust — we both 

lived in Bursley Hall last year, and the 

memory of our residence is still terrify-

ingly fresh.

Benches and overlooks like this are 

scattered generously all over the Arb. 

Runners trot past them, their masks set 

low like chin strasps. The chattering 

birds, their chorus, swirl around. Some 

will screech instead of sing — but their 

song, however unpleasant, you must re-

member is not for you.

There are plaques accompanying al-

most every bench in the Arboretum, 

adorning teak wood with memory and 

with fondness. I tally their beginnings:

In Loving Memory I I I I I I I I 

In Memory I I I I I I

In Recognition I I I I

In Honor I I I

In Tribute I I

These plaques lie on the backrest of 

the bench, some with quotes, some with-

out. I write down the most interesting 

ones, one of which is regrettably Shake-

speare: “Love comforteth like sunshine 

after rain.” Then I think: Who is to say 

the rain isn’t the comforting part? 

Another bench, oddly so, displays a 

plaque written in Swedish, and this is 

what Google Translate gives me: “Al-

ways so happy, so honest, so happy. An 

example. A sun stick in the dark.” I im-

mediately realize that a lot of its true 

linguistic meaning has been lost, but 

the sentiment of remembrance remains, 

even if partial. 

Farther along the path, another reads, 

“He lived and laughed, and loved and left, 

and the world will never be the same,” 

and I think I like this one the best. Per-

haps it is because of the alliteration, but 

it is more likely that I just appreciate a 

succinctly presented truth — the brevity 

of life. 

Past these benches, spiraling stairs 

lead me down to the grassy basin, the 

“main valley,” everything sloping and ev-

erything lush. Down there, the fences sit 

stacked with a conception so basic that 

they appear to me like Lincoln Logs — 

low and rudimentary — notched at the 

ends for a smart fit.

Some benches — yes, there are more 

here — aren’t wooden at all, some 

are just rectangular slabs of concrete 

wedged firmly into dark dirt, a shaded 

spot that doesn’t seem to necessitate 

a seat. Though these slabs don’t have a 

backrest, I like how firm they are, and I 

like that none of them can have plaques, 

which means no worrying over quotes. 

Squirrels wriggle their bodies through 

the cut grass, moving along in a fluid 

gait, which I find amusing. Squirrels 

aren’t typically characterized as elegant, 

but elegant is exactly the word I’d use to 

describe them if I was asked now. As soft 

ground gives way to my formerly clean 

sneakers, I head onward toward the Hu-

ron River. The highest leaves rustle in 

the wind like tossing trinkets; I prefer 

this gentle animation to stillness. 

The benches proliferate along the 

river, and a pedagogical sign fronts the 

moving water: Huron River Watershed.

wa • ter • shed

1. a ridge or stretch of high land divid-

ing the areas drained by different rivers or 

river systems

2. the area drained by a river or a river 

system

3. a crucial turning point, affecting ac-

tion, opinion, etc. 

A map explains the exact geographic 

setting I’ve wandered into: The Huron 

River is 130 miles long, the Nichols Ar-

boretum 123 acres. Seeing Lake Erie on 

the map is disorienting because I con-

stantly forget I’m on the east side of the 

state, not the west — where I grew up 

— and that it’s Lake Erie here, not Lake 

Michigan. Large ants crawl all over this 

sign, heading southeast and northwest, 

all over the board without concern for 

where they head, aimless but free. 

I choose a firm root at the edge of the 

river to sit on, instead of the slabs of 

pavement that jut rudely into the water’s 

edge. The soft ground and its firm roots, 

however dirtying, is the curb from which 

to properly observe. 

There’s a poem by W.H. Auden titled 

“It Was Easter as I Walked the Public 

Gardens” and in it he writes, “Watch-

ing traffic of magnificent cloud/moving 

without anxiety on open sky.” Although 

it is not Easter, not even close, and to-

day’s sky is cloudless, I still believe that 

a similar 

magnificence is taking place today 

in Nichols Arboretum. A heron wades 

through the river, folding its neck and 

plodding along, maneuvering through 

the traffic of the current. 

As I shift on my earthy seat, Auden’s 

words reverberating in my mind, I be-

gin to think about all the different ways 

to describe how a river babbles, how 

it ripples, how it bubbles in some plac-

es, spouting, and I find myself wishing 

for calm that I know won’t come for 

some months, when the semester is fi-

nally over and the snow comes to bring 

its total blanket. Until then, I’ll keep 

drumming up ways to describe what I 

find in the Arboretum, seated at the riv-

erside or in the grassy basin or even at 

my desk in my apartment, the wind car-

rying through the screen, maybe a trin-

ket or two falling on the sill.

T

he last Michigan 
team to win a 
national title was 
men’s gymnastics. 

The last one before that was 
also men’s gymnastics. By any 
measure, it’s 
among the 
most success-
ful programs 
in the school’s 
history, with 
six national 
titles and 
three in the 
last decade.

In short, 

when Kurt 
Golder — the coach who won 
those championships — talks, 
you should listen.

Golder started out his coach-

ing career at a local high school 
while in junior college, trying 
to scrape the grades to attend 
Michigan and compete in men’s 
gymnastics. He got the grades. 
He went to Michigan. Then, 
in his fifth year of school, he 
coached at Ann Arbor Huron 
High School. He’s been coach-
ing ever since, first at Ann Arbor 
Huron, then as an assistant at 
Michigan State, then at Genesee 
Valley — a boys’ gymnastics 
club — then at Iowa, then back 
at Michigan, with work for the 
U.S. national team peppered 
throughout. He’s won four 
national titles with the Wolver-
ines, including the school’s most 
recent in any sport, in 2014.

Now, he’s watching what 

could be the slow death of his 
sport.

Universities have been drop-

ping men’s gymnastics programs 
since the advent of Title IX in 
1972, so this isn’t a new prob-
lem, but it’s one accelerated by 
the pandemic. There were 15 
men’s programs competing last 
season and three — Iowa, Min-
nesota and William & Mary — 
have dropped the sport due to 

budget cuts. That means of the 
three colleges where Golder has 
coached, Michigan is the only 
one that still has a men’s gym-
nastics program.

“You’re seeing the demise of 

your sport, to some extent, right 
in front of your eyes,” Golder 
said.

He was sitting in his office, 

mask off so his words wouldn’t 
be obscured through the phone, 
on Tuesday afternoon. A couple 
hours prior, the Big Ten had 
announced it would play a foot-
ball season that, for all intents 
and purposes, amounts to a 
saving financial grace for strug-
gling athletic departments. 
Michigan, before and after that 
announcement, has been consis-
tent in the position that it won’t 
drop any sports, and Golder 
has nothing but praise for ath-
letic director Warde Manuel for 
sticking to it. 

But that won’t matter if the 

Wolverines are the only team 
left standing a few years from 

now.

“What we need right now is 

good leadership,” Golder said. 
“Let’s say when the bald eagle 
was nearing extinction, they 
put a Protected Species Act, and 
now the bald eagle is thriving. 
And that was good leadership. 

“... We just need athletic 

directors, like at the University 
of Iowa and the University of 
Minnesota, to have an attitude 
like our athletic director, Warde, 
and just say ‘We’re not gonna 
drop any sports.’ ”

Golder first started notic-

ing the effects of contraction 
decades ago when high school 
programs eliminated their 
men’s gymnastics teams. That, 
combined with a short high 
school season, meant talented 
young gymnasts who were seri-
ous about competing in college 
or the Olympics had to train at 
private clubs. Put it together and 
you get a country club sport.

Now, with fewer college 

programs, there’s more good 

athletes than scholarships. Tal-
ented gymnasts may get cut out 
of the sport if they can’t find a 
collegiate home. In turn, there’s 
less competition for the Olympic 
program, which already pales in 
comparison to the U.S. women’s 
team.

“I don’t see how gymnastics 

is gonna survive,” Ron Rapper, 
a captain on Michigan’s 1970 
national championship men’s 
gymnastics team said. “... For 
the athletes, yeah, they’re losing 
the sport they love, but they’re 
losing a lot of intangibles that 
they’d be able to build their life 
upon. Not everyone becomes an 
Olympic gymnast. Not everyone 
becomes an NFL football player. 
But that doesn’t mean that they 
don’t receive positive benefits 
from participating in the sport.”

If you’re a believer in the 

stated mission of college athlet-
ics — academics and life lessons 
and all of the stuff people like 
to talk about — you should care 
about this a whole lot more than 

whatever’s happening with 
football. Because men’s gym-
nasts aren’t making money off 
professional careers. Nobody 
is dropping bags to get them to 
commit. They’re the athletes to 
whom something resembling the 
NCAA’s mission actually applies, 
and schools are cutting them 
anyway.

“It does seem like we’re the 

targeted one,” Golder said. “Boy, 
I don’t have a good answer for 
(gymnastics being cut), unfortu-
nately. They’re one of the clean-
er programs in a department. 
They stay out of trouble for 
the most part. They have great 
GPAs, they take real challeng-
ing courses, they don’t bother 
people or anything. 

“In my opinion, they’re sort of 

like the model student-athletes, 
and they’re not rewarded for it. 
They’re eliminated as a result 
of it.”

When football season was 

canceled, the anger was pal-
pable. Parents protested in Rose-

mont and Ann Arbor. The public 
lost its mind and the season 
became a political prop.

Football is a lot bigger than 

men’s gymnastics. But maybe 
this deserves more than some 
frustration in select quarters of 
the internet.

“If there’s outrage because 

they’re delaying the (football) 
season or something like that, 
I’m OK with that,” Golder said. 
“I wish that we had the same 
public support and the same 
outrage when they cancelled our 
season. We had a really, really 
good shot at winning the Big 
Ten and NCAA championship 
last year. And of course that 
story will never be told or we’ll 
never know if we would have or 
not.

“But I’m just all about oppor-

tunities for every sport and 
it hurts to see any sport be 
dropped. Stanford dropped 11 
sports. They didn’t drop men’s 
gymnastics, so I’m real happy 
about that. But I’m pissed that 
the culture in America is elimi-
nating opportunity.”

Golder had to tell his team, 

one he thought had a shot at a 
national title, that their season 
was over last March. Imagine 
if he had to tell them the sport 
itself was done.

At least at Michigan, that 

won’t happen soon. But it’s hap-
pening elsewhere. 

Michigan doesn’t make 

money off men’s gymnastics. 
Even if there was a possibility of 
having fans this year, tickets are 
free. There aren’t media rights. 
These guys are playing for them-
selves and their school. And 
their sport is on the brink.

It’s on everyone else to notice.

Men’s gymnastics programs at universities across the United States are being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Allyson Eggleton lives by a 

formula.

Event, plus response, 

equals outcome. In a given 
race, the junior rower and her 
teammates on the Michigan 
women’s rowing team use it to 
spend energy only on what they 
can control, and not any bumps 
thrown their way. 

It seems simple enough. 

But when grappling with the 
age of COVID-19, the Big Ten 
canceling sports and prior per-
sonal struggles, Eggleton rode 
out — and continues to ride 
out — that mantra in the face of 
adversity. 

“Student athletes have such 

a pressure put on them and are 

seen as these holy icons of grit, 
strength and perseverance,” 
Eggleton said. “(Know) that it’s 
okay to struggle too, and that 
we all struggle, and that it’s not 
anything that’s not normal.”

As a teenager, Eggleton 

experienced, in her own words, 
severe bouts of depression and 
anxiety. Not comfortable tell-
ing anybody, she didn’t men-
tion it to anyone for four years 
until she told her doctor during 
her junior year of high school 
and finally found effective 
treatment methods.

That, in combination with 

coming to Ann Arbor, was a 
turning point — a renewed 
focus on the response, as 
opposed to the event. 

“The lowest was towards the 

end of high school, so coming 
out of that and coming to Mich-

igan, I was already working my 
way back up from like, a really 
dark place,” Eggleton said. 
“Michigan has been so helpful 
for me to have a community 
of people so passionate about 
what I’m passionate about.”

Whereas before Eggleton 

didn’t feel comfortable being 
vulnerable about mental 
health, her time at Michigan 
has not only enabled her to 
grow intrinsically, but also 
shaped her into a vocal advo-
cate for student-athlete mental 
health. Eggleton chose to major 
in psychology, is a student 
ambassador for “The Hidden 
Opponent” — a non-profit that 
aims to “address the stigma in 
sports culture” — and hopes 
to be selected to be one of two 
yearly mental health liaisons 
that facilitate discussions 

between student-athletes and 
the athletic department. 

And even though she 

believes that the Michigan 
athletic department as a whole 
does a good job of destigmatiz-
ing mental health and stress, 
she knows there’s always work 
to be done for every individual. 

“I think there’s a culture, 

I can’t speak on every team’s 
behalf, but the culture that 
my team and my coaches have 
built up has shown me a side 
of Michigan athletics that is 
focused on being the best you,” 
Eggleton said. “We preach ‘The 
Team, The Team, The Team,’ 
but you can’t contribute any-
thing to your team if you can’t 
keep yourself sane and happy.”

Eggleton is assured and plac-

id when she says that, but to 
anyone that’s followed college 

athletics during the COVID-19 
pandemic and the perils of can-
celed seasons for non-revenue 
sports, the rower’s demeanor 
only furthers underscores how 
vital being careful with her 
mental health habits is to her. 

When Michigan rowing 

coach Mark Rothstein got off 
the phone with the Big Ten 
after it canceled all spring 
championships in March, Egg-
leton was haunted — the “wails 
of her teammates” permanently 
and unforgettably etched in 
her mind. And as the sadness 
of a canceled season and time 
of relative isolation began for 
athletes across the university, 
Eggleton, as always, had a 
response. 

“We have a saying on the 

team: E+R=O,” Eggleton said. 
“Event plus response equals 

outcome, and the only thing 
that you can control in that 
formula is your response. I’ve 
been thinking about that a lot 
and how this year is looking 
going ahead, not just for my 
team but for my life, and what 
I can control, in the event of 
COVID, is my response and 
outlook.” 

“So that’s my biggest piece 

of advice — focus on what you 
can control, the way you react 
and look at any situation with a 
glass half-full, and if it doesn’t 
take you far it will hopefully 
warp your perspective a little 
bit and take you down a more 
positive path.”

Sometimes the best Egg-

leton, or anyone, can do is 
just keep rowing and react-
ing — bumps along the way be 
damned.

perfect formula

On Aug. 23, a video went viral of 

a police officer shooting a Black man 
named Jacob Blake seven times in his 
back in front of his family in Kenosha, 
Wisc. Yet another disturbing story of 
police brutality, the shooting of Blake 
sent shockwaves to the growing 
protests and marches that had been 
happening since June in cities across 
the country. 

Three days later, the Milwaukee 

Bucks’ players decided that it was 
not appropriate to continue playing 
sports as the country continued to 
burn both physically and spiritually. 
The ensuing league-wide boycott 
cancelled 
the 
remaining 
NBA 

games for several days, all while 
in the midst of a hotly contested 
playoff. The rest of the sports world 
followed, as athletes demonstrated 
that there were bigger things at play 
than sports.

Seeing the horrific videos and 

hearing about the stories that have 
been circulating these past few 
months, Michigan senior defensive 
lineman Kwity Paye, along with 
many other athletes around the 
country, felt that it was too hard to 
continue to do his job and go along 
with his normal life.

“During camp, a lot of news was 

breaking out about police killing a 
Black man,” Paye told The Daily. “A 
lot of people were outraged with all 
the social injustice going on.”

Paye and graduate Michigan 

defensive lineman Carlo Kemp 
couldn’t stand being complacent, 
so they decided to take action. The 
one thing they could control was 

getting themselves and their team 
registered to vote. 

“It was something that we’ve 

wanted for a while,” Paye said, “For 
me, although I have never voted 
before, it was something that I felt 
like I had to do. To make change, the 
change I want, it starts with voting 
and getting registered was the first 
step in doing that.”

So, last Thursday, Paye and Kemp 

led an initiative to register the 
Michigan football team to vote in the 
upcoming November election. 

“There was one day after practice,” 

Paye said, “me and Carlo had to call 
(director of player personnel) Sean 
Magee one day a while ago and we 
were like ‘Is it possible for the whole 

team to get registered to vote?’ … 
One day randomly after practice, we 
walk into the locker room and the 
table was set up and they got guys 
registered to vote.”

Elections are a staple of a 

democracy, and the best way that 
citizens can have an immediate 
impact on their community is by 
choosing the people they think fit 
their beliefs and ideas on how to 
solve issues and lead. 

However, the past few years, 

many 
people, 
especially 
young 

people, have refrained from voting 
and neglected their right. In 2016, 
only 58.1% of voting-eligible people 
turned out to vote and despite young 
people (18-29 year olds) making up 

a third of those people, only half of 
them actually voted. 

“For a while,” Paye said, “the older 

generation thought that we weren’t 
the type to fight back or the type to 
go out and do these protests or the 
type to stand up for what we think 
is right.” 

But this election feels different 

from the rest. There’s so much at 
stake as this country handles the 
worst pandemic seen in a century, 
as well as the uprising of sweeping 
social movements. Paye and many 
other community leaders agree that 
now is the right time for people to get 
active in making decisions that could 
affect their lives by using their right 
to vote.

“I would say it is just really 

different,” Paye said, “... We are 
getting a lot more of the younger 
generation into voting, because we 
have seen what has happened in past 
years where our generation doesn’t 
vote. We don’t get what we want in 
office, so for us, it’s a duty.”

Many young athletes argue that 

getting involved in the voting process 
is the best way to do that. On June 
22, LeBron James and his business 
team created ‘More than a Vote,’ an 
organization — consisting of Black 
athletes and artists — to encourage 
participation in elections and make 
it easier for people to register and 
request ballots. 

Like James, Paye and Kemp 

have realized the potential for 
using their platform for good. They 
decided to start internally by getting 
themselves registered, before going 
out and encouraging others to do the 
same. 

“We just wanted to do our part,” 

Paye said. “Make sure that we’re 
voting. Just because the stuff 
that’s going on right now, it’s just 
ridiculous.”

Most 
of 
Kemp 
and 
Paye’s 

teammates were not even registered 
to vote prior to this month, so they 
jumped at this opportunity that 
Kemp and Paye provided. 

“It was just something as a world, 

we have to take on and vote and 
change the world and make it a 
better place,” senior defensive back 
Brad Hawkins said. “We preach that 
at the university, staying together 
and being a family. That’s something 
that was helpful for us and we took 
pride in everyone getting registered 
to vote.”

Michigan football players know 

what’s at stake come November, 
and they want to make sure they 
do their part to fight for the issues 
they think are important for them. 
They understand that — as young 
people — they are the future, and the 
issues present now are ones that will 
continue to affect them unless any 
change happens. 

“The next generation is gonna be 

possibly taking over this country,” 
Paye said, “and we are gonna 
have to be ones to make decisions. 
The younger generation has the 
obligation to start doing things 
now and showing that they can 
be responsible enough in the near 
future to fix what’s wrong and just 
do what’s right by the other citizens.”

With football’s return on the 

horizon, Michigan ready to play

When Josh Ross typed “Big 

Ten” into Twitter’s search 
bar Wednesday morning, it 
showed the senior linebacker 
everything he wanted to know. 

In five weeks, he would be 

playing football.

“We were so excited hearing 

that news,” Ross said. “Finally! 
That’s how I was feeling, 
‘Finally!’ We’ve been putting 
so much work in preparing 
and it’s just a blessing we get 
to play this fall.”

Since the announcement, 

that’s 
been 
the 
prevailing 

feeling among the Michigan 
football team, which hasn’t 
stopped 
practicing 
since 

returning to campus in June. 
The Wolverines have made it a 
point to stay ready to play.

Hearing the news changed 

the 
tenor 
of 
Michigan’s 

practice on Wednesday. The 
intensity 
was 
higher. 
The 

adrenaline, too. Football was 
back. 

Well, 
with 
just 
a 
few 

changes.

The Big Ten announced 

that it would not allow general 
ticket 
sales 
for 
the 
2020 

season, with the only potential 
recipients being families of 
players and staff. Michigan 
president 
Mark 
Schlissel 

confirmed Thursday that there 
would be no fans in the stands 
at Michigan Stadium. But at 
this point, the Wolverines 
don’t care how many fans 
there are as long as it means 
they get to play football.

“At the end of the day I 

just want to play,” Ross said. 
“Regardless 
of 
if 
there’s 

people in the stands, we can 
be playing in Schembechler 
(Hall). I just want to play at 
the end of the day. It might be a 
little weird, but it don’t matter, 
we wanna go out there and 
play and hit.”

Another 
difference 
this 

year is part of what enabled 
the Big Ten’s return — a strict 
set of protocols. Among them 
is a rule that if at least 5% of 
a team’s tests are positive and 
7.5% of the team population 
tests positive in a seven-
day period, that team must 
shut down practice for seven 
days. Additionally, any player 
who tests positive can only 
return after a minimum of 
21 days post-diagnosis, all in 
a nine-week schedule with 
no bye weeks. Although the 
protocols are strict, Michigan 
is prepared to meet them. 
After all, the Wolverines have 
already gone three months 
without a positive test thanks 
to 
strong 
enforcement. 

The 
new 
thresholds 
add 

an 
additional 
incentive 
to 

comply with social distancing 
requirements.

“When they said that, I’m 

not leaving the house unless 
I’m at (Schembechler),” Ross 
said. “I’m not leaving, I’m not 
going anywhere. Of course if I 
got class, but other than that, 
I’m in my apartment.”

Several notable players — 

wide receiver Nico Collins, 
cornerback 
Ambry 
Thomas 

and offensive tackle Jalen 
Mayfield 
— 
have 
already 

declared for the draft, though 
Thomas indicated on Big Ten 
Radio on Thursday that he may 
be able to return. But many 
2019 starters are back. Senior 
defensive lineman Kwity Paye 
expressed his intention to play 
in 2020 on Twitter.

And 
fifth-year 
senior 

running back Chris Evans is 
returning from suspension.

Even with several losses on 

the offensive side — including 
all 
five 
starting 
offensive 

linemen, Collins and fellow 
receivers Donovan Peoples-
Jones and Tarik Black — the 
returning players on that side 
of the ball are steadfast in 
their confidence that they’ll 
be ready to go. Among those 
waiting in the wings are 
junior quarterback Joe Milton, 
presumed to be the starter, and 
wide receivers Giles Jackson, 
Cornelius Johnson and Mike 
Sainristil, who all saw time at 
the position in 2019.

“I wouldn’t say it really 

feels different,” Jackson said. 
“We’re rolling on offense. It 
doesn’t feel like we’ve really 
missed a beat, honestly. If 
you just look out there, yeah, 
there’s new people out there 
but you can’t tell. We look 
good.”

For now, the next step for 

Michigan is getting in pads, a 
step previously not allowed by 
the Big Ten. Ross emphasized 
how much he’s missed padded 
practice, noting the tenacity 
of hitting another player. But 
there’s further significance, 
too: Each day the players 
spend in pads will be one day 
closer to the return of games.

help Michigan football team register to vote

In Donovan Edwards, Michigan has its 

chance to win back the mitten

OAK PARK — Late Friday 

night, in the moments before the 
floodlights flicked off at Oak Park 
High School, Donovan Edwards 
stood surrounded by media, 
answering a slew of questions 
about his future. This is the 
situation the West Bloomfield 
running back finds himself in 
now, as a blue-chip prospect in 
the backyard of a school that so 
desperately needs him.

When he speaks, a group 

of reporters swarms, as if he’s 
already at Michigan — or Georgia 
or Oklahoma or any of the other 
major Division I programs in 
pursuit of his talents. And when 
he’s done, the lights darken, as if 
they had waited for the night’s 
brightest star to be done dazzling.

Friday, 
by 
Edwards’ 
own 

admission, 
wasn’t 
his 
finest 

performance. Quarterback Alex 
Short and running back Dillon 
Tatum both saw more usage as 
West Bloomfield romped to a 
39-0 win. But when the Lakers 
needed him, Edwards stepped up, 
rushing for three touchdowns and 
flashing a little bit of everything 
that makes him the top player on 
Michigan’s 2021 board.

“My ability to run up the field 

to score a touchdown, I feel as 
though it’s unmatched,” Edwards 
said after the game.

For the Wolverines, though, 

that’s not why Edwards matters 
so much.

Per 
247Sports 
composite 

rankings, he’s the 36th-ranked 
player in the 2021 class. That’s 
10 
spots 
higher 
than 
Zach 

Charbonnet was in 2019 and a few 
dozen higher than Blake Corum 
was last year. On the field, he 
would combine with JJ McCarthy 
to create a tantalizingly talented 
offensive duo. He would, in other 
words, be critical to Michigan’s 
short-term success.

But the Wolverines’ 2021 class 

would still be dwarfed by Ohio 
State’s. Jim Harbaugh would 
still face an uphill battle to carry 
Michigan to the heights most 
envisioned when he arrived in 
Ann Arbor five years ago.

Here in Metro Detroit, though, 

Edwards’ 
commitment 
would 

represent a shifting of the tides.

“Given the fact that he’s so 

highly ranked and he’s right in 
their backyard and Michigan led 
very early on big time, it would be 
a massive disappointment if they 
couldn’t get that one done,” Steve 
Lorenz, a recruiting analyst at 
247Sports, said.

For years, even as Harbaugh 

has consistently compiled top-
ranked recruiting classes, he’s 
faced questions in Metro Detroit. 
Last 
month, 
Rocco 
Spindler 

committed to Notre Dame amid 
heavy pursuit from Michigan. 
In 2020, Justin Rodgers — the 
state’s top recruit — ended up 
at Kentucky. The year before, it 
was Devontae Dobbs and Julian 
Barnett out of Belleville High 
School, both of whom went to 
Michigan State.

Perhaps, Lorenz says, these 

struggles 
are 
blown 
out 
of 

proportion 
by 
perception. 

Recruiting in 2020 requires a 
national footprint. But at the 
same time, it’s true that Ohio 
State doesn’t miss out on the top 
recruits in Ohio. Michigan, for 

whatever reason, misses out on 
the top recruits in Michigan.

In Edwards, the Wolverines 

have the chance to change that.

“He’s a kid that a lot of kids are 

following , his lead and his path on 
things,” Ron Bellamy, Edwards’ 
coach at West Bloomfield, said 
when asked whether Edwards 
could help Michigan’s future 
recruiting in Metro Detroit. “He’s 
a kid that whatever college he 
chooses, he’s going to entice kids 
to maybe follow his path.”

Bellamy is careful to play 

politics, too. When asked whether 
Michigan would be impacted in 
the long term if Edwards selects 
Georgia or Oklahoma, he says 
no, citing the Wolverines’ ability 
to identify talent. It’s hard to 
comport that, though, with “he’s 
going to entice kids to maybe 
follow his path.”

That’s 
why 
Michigan 
has 

known Edwards is a player they 
had to have since he started high 
school, if not earlier. And it’s why, 
before games, Michigan running 
backs’ coach Jay Harbaugh calls 
Edwards to give him pointers 
and forge a relationship beyond 
football.

“The 
people 
I’m 
gonna 

be around every single day,” 
Edwards said of what he’s looking 
for in a school. “The coaches’ 
personalities, just being around a 
great atmosphere, an atmosphere 
that feels just like home.”

Come 
December, 
when 

Edwards is expecting to make his 
decision, that’s what Michigan 
will need to provide.

If the Wolverines can deliver, 

they’ll land not only a future star 
in their backfield, but an inroads 
to reclaiming their backyard.

Report: Jalen Mayfield hoping to

opt back in for 2020 season

When Michigan begins its season 

on Oct. 24, it will do so with one of its 
top prospects for the 2021 NFL Draft.

On 
Friday 
afternoon, 
Rivals 

reported that offensive tackle Jalen 
Mayfield was hoping to opt back 
into the 2020 season after originally 
declaring for the draft in August. 
Mayfield seemed to confirm the news 
on Twitter shortly afterward with a 
shoutout to quarterback Joe Milton.

Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis 

also tweeted about the development. 
“Let’s go!!! This season will be special 
for you!!!” the tweet read.

Although Mayfield has expressed 

his desire to return now that the Big 

Ten has reversed course and decided 
to play this fall after all, he and 
receiver Nico Collins will still need 
approval from the NCAA to play. 
According to Albert Breer of Sports 
Illustrated, Mayfield signed with an 
agent after opting out, which would 
normally render a player ineligible. 
Attorney Tom Mars has expressed 
that players like Mayfield would 
likely have a good argument to be 
reinstated given that the Big Ten 
originally said that their decision 
to postpone the fall season would 
not be revisited. According to The 
Athletic, Mayfield is still enrolled in 
online classes for the fall semester, 
which would clear another eligibility 
hurdle.

Mayfield is not the only Big Ten 

player who originally declared for the 

draft who is now hoping to opt back 
in. Minnesota wide receiver Rashod 
Bateman is also hoping to gain 
eligibility. A statement put out by the 
Golden Gophers’ football program 
today indicated that Bateman has 
been allowed to practice with the 
team, but they are still working to get 
him cleared by the NCAA to play.

Before news broke of Mayfield’s 

intention to return, Gattis expressed 
on Twitter that players like Bateman 
and Mayfield should be able to opt 
back in if they so choose.

“Players who opted out to prepare 

for the NFL should all be reinstated 
without penalty regardless of what 
they accepted it’s not a competitive 
advantage,” 
the 
tweet 
read. 

“However these agents offering these 
young men money to leave school in 

the fall show they don’t have a post 
NFL plan for you!”

If the Wolverines can get Mayfield 

back, it will be a boon for a team that 
looked like it would have to break in 
five new offensive linemen this fall. 
Mayfield, who started at right tackle 
in 2019, held his own against Ohio 
State’s Chase Young. He is widely 
considered one of Michigan’s top 
draft prospects and ranked in the top 
50 of CBS Sports’ Big Board. Should 
Mayfield be ruled eligible, his skill 
and experience will help anchor the 
young unit.

It remains to be seen whether 

the other Michigan players who 
have opted out — cornerback Ambry 
Thomas, Collins and running back 
Christian Turner — will choose to 
opt back in.

How Michigan will fill voids

left by departures

When the Michigan football 

team takes the field the weekend 
of Oct. 24, it will do so without a 
handful of key pieces.

Cornerback 
Ambry 
Thomas 

declared for the NFL Draft last 
month, leaving the Wolverines 
without their top cornerback. 
On 
Wednesday, 
mere 
hours 

after news broke of a unanimous 
decision to begin a Big Ten 
football season, Sports Illustrated 
reported that senior wideout Nico 
Collins signed with agent Drew 
Rosenhaus and the Detroit News 
reported that redshirt junior 
quarterback Dylan McCaffrey has 
opted out of the 2020 season and 
intends to transfer.

With three marquee players no 

longer in the fold, The Daily broke 
down how Michigan can fill the 
voids this fall:

Replacing Nico Collins
Perhaps the Wolverines’ most 

dangerous 
offensive 
threat 
a 

season ago, Collins’s decision to 
sign with an NFL agent leaves 
Michigan without its top vertical 
threat. 
Collins 
recorded 
37 

catches for 729 receiving yards 
and seven touchdowns as a junior, 
including 
a 
165-yard, 
three-

touchdown 
outburst 
against 

Indiana in November.

The Wolverines’ wide receivers 

room already took a hit when 
Donovan Peoples-Jones declared 
for the NFL Draft following his 
junior season, and with Collins 
now gone, it appears the team’s 
top returner will be junior slot 
receiver Ronnie Bell. Behind him, 
sophomores Giles Jackson, Mike 
Sainristil and Cornelius Johnson 
showed flashes of potential as 
true freshmen last fall.

Without the 6-foot-4 Collins, 

offensive coordinator Josh Gattis’ 
emphasis on speed will only 
become more important. Jackson 
and Sainristil are two of the 
fastest players on the team, while 
the Wolverines will also welcome 
a pair of four-star burners in A.J. 
Henning and Roman Wilson.

Replacing Ambry Thomas
When 
Thomas 
announced 

he’d be returning for his senior 
season in January, it provided 
some much-needed experience 
for a cornerbacks group that lost 
Lavert Hill to the 2020 NFL Draft. 
Thomas started all 13 games at 
cornerback last year, recording 38 
tackles and three interceptions en 
route to a third team All-Big Ten 
selection.

Without 
Thomas, 
the 

Wolverines’ top cornerback will 
be redshirt sophomore Vincent 
Gray, who appeared in all 13 
games last fall. Candidates to start 
opposite Gray and in the nickel 
include redshirt freshman D.J. 
Turner and true freshman Andre 
Seldon, neither of which have any 
in-game college experience at 
cornerback. Redshirt freshman 
Jalen 
Perry 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore Gemon Green could 
also carve out roles.

In Thomas, the Wolverines also 

lose an explosive kick returner. 
Jackson, who returned a kickoff 
for a touchdown against Maryland 

last fall, figures to handle the 
majority of return duties this fall.

Replacing Dylan McCaffrey
After 
totaling 
242 
passing 

yards, 166 rushing yards and 
five total touchdowns across 13 
career appearances, McCaffrey 
will finish out his remaining two 
years of eligibility elsewhere. 

By all accounts, McCaffrey’s 

decision to opt out and transfer 
is an indicator that the starting 
quarterback 
job 
belongs 
to 

redshirt sophomore Joe Milton. 
With Milton and his cannon of 
an arm under center, Michigan’s 
offense 
unlocks 
another 

dimension of verticality. Milton 
showed 
flashes 
of 
potential 

against Rutgers last September, 
completing three of his four passes 
for 59 yards and a touchdown.

As 
Milton 
slides 
into 
the 

starting role, redshirt freshman 
Cade 
McNamara 
becomes 

the presumptive backup. The 
Wolverines also added three-star 
pro-style quarterback Dan Villari 
to their 2020 recruiting class last 
December.

Wide receiver Nico Collins is one of three major departures for the Michigan football team, the others being cornerback Ambry Thomas and quarterback Dylan McCaffrey. 

Casey Phinney flips commitment 
from Michigan to Boston College

On 
Saturday 
morning, 
the 

Michigan 
football 
team’s 
2021 

recruiting class lost its second 
member in as many weeks when 
three-star inside linebacker Casey 
Phinney flipped his commitment to 
Boston College.

Recruited by defensive coordinator 

Don 
Brown, 
the 
Marshfield, 

Mass. native originally committed 
to 
Michigan 
over 
Army, 
Yale, 

Georgetown and Princeton, among 
others, on Apr. 3. Phinney is a high 
school teammate of four-star 2021 
offensive lineman Drew Kendall, one 
of offensive line coach Ed Warinner’s 
top recruiting targets this cycle.

Ranked the No. 1,189 overall 

prospect in the 2021 class, Phinney 
was the Wolverines’ lowest-rated 
linebacker commitment and the 
third-lowest overall player in the 
class, according to the 247Sports 
composite. 
Following 
Phinney’s 

departure, the Wolverines’ 2021 class 
now ranks No. 10 nationally in the 
247Sports team rankings.

With Phinney no longer in the 

fold, Michigan is now left with three 

linebackers in its recruiting class: 
four-stars Junior Colson and Jaydon 
Hood and three-star Tyler McLaurin. 
Whether or not the Wolverines 
pursue a fourth linebacker at this 
point remains to be seen.

Earlier this month, Michigan’s 

recruiting class also lost three-star 
wide receiver Markus Allen. Without 
Phinney, the Wolverines’ 2021 group 
is down to 20 total commitments.

For years, Joe Milton’s talent has been a mercurial talking 
point at the tip of Michigan coaches’ tongues. There are 
the stories, repeated ad nauseum, of his arm strength. 
Early in his Michigan career, the stories go, he injured 
receivers with passes zipped in at warp speed. Eighty-
five yards, allegedly, is his maximum throwing distance.

Giles Jackson has one of those stories too, as told in a 

Zoom call with reporters Thursday.

“In practice one time, we had a deep ball, I was 

probably 70 yards out and he just launched it,” the 
sophomore receiver said. “I thought he threw it late, 
but the ball beat me to my spot. I was like, whoa. He has 
an arm I’ve never seen before.”

There’s a different tone to such a story now, though. 

Because over the course of a few hours Wednesday 

morning, everything changed for Milton. First, the Big 

Ten announced its plans to return to play after canceling the 
fall football season just five weeks prior. Then, a few hours 

later, word trickled in that senior Dylan McCaffrey was 

opting out to pursue a transfer.

Suddenly, Milton, whose precocious talent had 
always sat outside of the limelight, was in line 

to start a football game for Michigan in just 

five weeks. For Milton, it’s an opportunity 

he always deemed within reach even 

as most outside the program assumed 

McCaffrey 
would 
succeed 
Shea 

Patterson as the Wolverines’ starter.

“Nothing been on my mind to 

(transfer) somewhere else,” Milton 
said last December, ahead of the 
Citrus Bowl. “Just being patient 
and humble. It’s gonna come one 
day.”

The program did not make 

Milton available to media Thursday 
afternoon, but Jackson has seen 
his teammate seize this offseason’s 
quarterback competition, even as 
practice time has been limited due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think he’s just more focused, 

I’d say,” Jackson said. “You could 
tell, as soon as this offseason, he 
was a whole different person. He 
was more serious, more focused. 
You could tell, he wanted to play, 

and he was just more locked in.”
The two live next door in Ann Arbor 

and have developed into close friends 

over the past year, part of a bond between 

Michigan’s quarterbacks and receivers. On 

the field, that has parlayed into a trust between 

two largely inexperienced groups.
After Nico Collins signed with an agent this week, 

indicating his intentions to declare for the NFL Draft, 

the Wolverines’ only returning starting pass catchers 

are junior receiver Ronnie Bell and fifth-year senior 

tight end Nick Eubanks. That lack of experience leaves 

a heavy burden on Michigan’s sophomore trio of Giles 

Jackson, Cornelius Johnson and Mike Sainristil. The three 

combined for just 21 catches for 348 yards and a touchdown 

last season, but all fit the mold of offensive coordinator Josh 

Gattis’ speed in space philosophy.
Combined with their burgeoning connection with Milton, that 

has Jackson feeling confident.

“I’m always with him getting better, watching film,” Jackson 

said. “I know in the offseason we were getting together, throwing 
footballs together a lot. That just helped. We have a good bond.”

Put it all together and Michigan has an offense built of players 

whose talent has always lurked in the shadows, thrust into the public 
eye only by press conference hype. On the field, Milton is 6-for-11 

for 117 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. His freshman 

year of college, in which he went 3-for-4, is the only time he’s ever 

completed more than 50 percent of his passes, including in high 

school. And in Collins, he loses the receiver who most fits with 

his vertical style of play, at least on paper.

But now, that qualifier — “on paper” — is on the verge of 
becoming a remnant of the past for Milton. In 36 days, he 

will almost certainly take the field as Michigan’s QB1. 

And when he does so, the hype will finally meet its test.
