SACUA meets 
with ‘U’ provost 
to discuss engaged 

learning, access

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack joined the Senate Assem-
bly during their meeting Monday 
to discuss several University pri-
orities, including access and digi-
tal education. The Assembly also 

passed a resolution discouraging 
faculty from signing confidential-
ity agreements when serving on 
University committees.

During her presentation, Pol-

lack highlighted four areas of 
focus: innovation in teaching and 
learning techniques, pursuit of 
bold research projects, fostering 
a diverse and inclusive campus 
and ensuring the affordability of 
a University education.

At a time when new technol-

ogy is making education formats 
more widely available and open, 
Pollack said the University is also 
thinking about the kind of learn-

ing experiences that will prove 
most relevant as students enter 
careers post-graduation.

“If your world is uncertain and 

ambiguous, you need the ability 
to take risks,” Pollack said. “You 
don’t learn that by being lectured 
to. If the world is complex, you 
need to be able to synthesize vari-
ous complex ideas.”

Though online tools can often 

diversify the learning experience, 
Pollack said online education 
tools would not erode the value of 
face-to-face education.

Apart from digital and engaged 

learning, Pollack also discussed 

the importance of diversity and 
inclusion at the University, not-
ing one of the institution’s largest 
challenges remains increasing 
the enrollment of under-repre-
sented minority students.

In the last year, students have 

called on the University to address 
issues of diversity and inclusion, 
most prominently as part of the 
Being Black at the University of 
Michigan campaign lead by the 
University’s Black Student Union. 
In December, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel announced

Six Greek 
chapters 
suspended

Student leaders 
release statement 
condemning ski 
resort vandalism

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

After 
several 
University 

Greek life chapters reportedly 
caused damage at two Michigan 
ski resorts, six Greek life chap-
ters reportedly involved — the 
University’s chapters of Sigma 
Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau, Pi 
Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi, Chi Psi 
and Delta Gamma — have now 
been suspended by their national 
chapters, according to a Univer-
sity release.

The Sigma Alpha Mu chap-

ter, which stayed at the Tree-
tops Resort with members from 
Sigma Delta Tau, was suspended 
last week by their national orga-
nization.

In a statement released Sat-

urday, three student leaders 
published an open letter apolo-
gizing for the events and promis-
ing action to hold those involved 
accountable.

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy junior; Interfra-
ternity Council President Alex 
Krupiak, an LSA senior; and 
Panhellenic Association Presi-
dent Maddy Walsh, a Business 
junior, authored the letter to 
apologize for the behavior of 
these organizations.

“This terrible incident has 

been widely publicized across 
the nation, and rightly so: it was 
an act of shocking disrespect,” 
the letter said. “We, as leaders 
and Greeks at the University of 
Michigan, do not tolerate these 
kinds of acts, nor do we let such 
behavior fall under the radar. 
We intend to handle this situa-
tion with the utmost efficiency, 
and we will ensure that those 
responsible for the damage to the 
properties will be held account-
able throughout this process.”

Access to student 
information could 

fuel improved 

learning analytics

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

The University is exploring 

innovative methods to use exist-
ing data to improve teaching and 
learning techniques.

Though the University cur-

rently retains student data, such 
as course grades, some officials 
argue the information should 
be more accessible to research-
ers and professors, who can in 
turn use it to improve the student 
experience inside the classroom.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, James Hilton, 
vice provost for digital education 
and innovation, said he is working 
with an informal group to draft a 
Standard Practice Guide policy to 
govern the use of collected data.

“We’ve been discussing the 

issues and principles involved 
and we’re in the process of draft-
ing an SPG, which would actually 
be the policy,” Hilton said. “Once 
we have that drafted, we will re-
shop it to get feedback on it to 
make sure everyone has a voice.”

Hilton said the SPG would 

largely focus on institutionaliz-
ing the process for accessing the 
data and opening up access for 
researchers to see sets of infor-
mation already collected by the 
University.

“How would you go about 

gaining access to data to see, for 
example, whether or not there’s a 
correlation between the sequenc-
es of courses people take and 
their success in those courses,” 
Hilton said. “Those are two dif-
ferent data sets right now.”

Because the SPG only exists as 

a draft, Hilton said he could not 
provide specific policies that may 
govern the use of student data. 
However, he added that the Uni-
versity collects data in a similar 
way that commercial websites 
analyze online behavior and use 
it to customize an Internet user’s 
online experience.

“But what if, instead of using 

analytics to deliver advertise-
ments, we use the same data-
intensive approach to deliver 
learning objects, tips and assis-
tance at just the right time as you 
go through the semester?” he 
said.

Hilton pointed to eCoach, a 

classroom data collection pro-
gram that uses information col-
lected from previous students’ 
responses to provide customized 
feedback to current students, as 
an example of how student data 
collection benefits both students 
and educators. Many large intro-
ductory STEM classes already 
use the program.

Currently, students who decide 

to participate in eCoach’s data 
collection complete a survey at 
the beginning of the semester 
that asks them a variety of ques-
tions about their expectations for 
the course.

Researchers 

identify pathway 

that monitors blood 

sugar levels

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Researchers from the Unit-

ed Kingdom and the Michigan 
Comprehensive Diabetes Center 
have identified the brain cells 
wired to detect glucose levels — 
a discovery which could improve 
how patients and doctors man-
age diabetes.

Martin Myers, a researcher 

at the Comprehensive Diabetes 
Center and an associate profes-
sor of Internal Medicine and 
molecular and integrative physi-
ology, said people with type 1 
diabetes cannot produce insulin 
and must keep their blood sugar 
as close to normal as possible. 
People with diabetes, particu-
larly type 1, have to constantly 
manage their blood sugar levels. 
But when participating in inten-
sive insulin therapy, people run 
a high risk of receiving too much 
insulin — a problem that can 
result in decreased blood sugar 
levels.

After three years of research, 

the scientists recently found a 
brain pathway that produces 
cholecystokinin, or CCK, a brain 
hormone that can detect blood 
glucose levels.

Myers said researchers are 

now studying neurons in the

Awaiting organ 

transplant, 
man receives 

innovative device

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

For a man without his heart, 

Stan Larkin is in good spirits.

The 
University’s 
Samuel 

and Jean Frankel Cardiovas-
cular Center recently pro-
vided 24-year-old Stan Larkin 
with a SynCardia temporary 
Total Artificial Heart that has 
allowed him to return home 
while waiting for a regular 
heart transplant.

Larkin 
has 
biventricular 

heart failure, meaning his ven-

tricles cannot effectively pump 
blood to his organs and has 
suffered from multiple heart 
failures and arrhythmias. Typ-
ically, patients needing a new 
heart are placed on a transplant 
list. Once on the list, it could 
be months to years before a 
patient has access to the donor 
heart he or she needs.

Larkin is the first patient 

in Michigan history to leave 
a hospital without a human 
heart. He is currently equipped 
with the Freedom Driver, a 
portable pump created by Syn-
Cardia Systems, Inc., a device 
he will use until he is eligible 
for a heart transplant.

Jonathan 
Haft, 
associate 

professor of cardiac surgery, 
said Larkin’s need for a heart 
was urgent.

“His condition deteriorated 

to the point where we were 
considering 
him 
for 
heart 

transplantation, but we did not 
think that he was going to have 
the time to wait until that suit-
able donor became available,” 
he said.

Haft said mechanical heart 

support has progressed since 
the 1970s, but Larkin’s situation 
is a first in that the Freedom 
Driver is easily transportable 
and allows patients to leave the 
hospital.

“What’s new and innova-

tive about this device is that 
the external component is now 
portable and allows patients 
to go home,” Haft said. “At our 
center, we’ve always been able 
to transplant patients within 
a five- or six-month period of 
time.”

Larkin is still listed for a

DANIEL KARR

Bipartisan leadership

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Instructor Portia Thomas leading her Cardio 
Kickboxing Class at the Trotter House on Monday. 

KICKIN ’ IT

LSA sophomore Daniel Karr 

is president of the Univer-
sity chapter of Common Sense 
Action, a national bipartisan 
advocacy organization that 
provides students a platform 
for policymaking and fighting 
for generational equality. CSA 
focuses on addressing domestic 
policy issues from the perspec-
tive of Millennials. 

What is Common Sense 

Action?

Common Sense Action is a 

bipartisan advocacy organiza-
tion that’s main goal is to bring 
Millennials to the policymak-
ing table. It is mainly a national 
organization with 40 chapters 

on 40 different campuses that 
each have their own advocacy 
plan. We all support the same 
general framework for goals, 
called the Agenda for Genera-
tional Equity.

What is the advocacy plan for 

the University chapter?

This semester we’re focusing 

on an advocacy plan to reduce 
Michigan’s budget deficit. If 
you really think about what is 
going to affect Millenials when 
we grow up and we’re living 
and working in Michigan, hav-
ing a secure and solvent budget 
is one of the most important 
issues. Obviously the budget 
is pretty complicated, so we’re 

focusing on three main areas. 
One, incarceration reform, 
reforming our prisons and mak-
ing them more cost effective. 
Two, pension reform — 80 per-
cent of Michigan’s debt comes 
from misallocation of funds and 
pensions. The third strategy is 
something called “reality-based 
budgeting,” sort of a commit-
ment by the government to 
really only fund what’s most 
important. That means listing 
out in priority every single bud-
get item. Once you run out of 
money you have to make cuts; 
you cut off the bottom of the 
priority list.

Former football 
players plead not 
guilty to charges 

(AP) — The rape trial of two 

former Vanderbilt football play-
ers began wrapping up Monday 
with a prosecutor telling jurors 
that video evidence and photo-
graphs taken of the crime would 
be enough to convict them on 
most of the charges.

Beyond the video footage 

and 
photographs, 
testimony 

from several athletes shows 
the players are guilty, Assistant 
District Attorney Jan Norman 
told jurors during closing argu-
ments.

The proceedings capped off 

a day of dramatic testimony 
during which one of the former 
players took the stand and tes-
tified that he was so drunk he 

could not remember what hap-
pened.

Former players Brandon Van-

denburg and Cory Batey are 
standing trial on five counts of 
aggravated rape and two counts 
of aggravated sexual battery. 
Two other former players are 
facing the same charges. Van-
denburg additionally faces a 
charge of unlawful photogra-
phy and tampering with evi-
dence.

All have pleaded not guilty.
Throughout the trial, jurors 

have seen graphic images of 
the alleged sexual assault that 
police recovered from cell-
phones and a laptop. Prosecu-
tors said players took pictures 
of the assault and one even sent 
videos to his friends as it was 
happening.

“This is normally the part of 

the trial where we might say 
that if we had this on photo or if 

we had it on video, then it would 
make the state’s job a lot easier,” 
Norman told jurors in her clos-
ing. “But we actually have this 
uncontradicted proof in this 
case,” the prosecutor said of one 
of the rape charges.

Defense 
attorneys 
have 

claimed that the players were 
drunk, one of them saying his 
client had an alcoholic blackout.

“Ladies and gentleman, I sub-

mit to you that the only person 
who was unconscious and didn’t 
know what was going on was 
(the victim),” Norman told jurors 
in her closing arguments.

A defense attorney for Batey 

responded by telling jurors that 
they would not see video or pho-
tographic evidence of his client 
having sex with the coed.

“The testimony was he was 

crazy drunk and didn’t know 
what he was doing,” Robinson 
told jurors of Batey. Robinson 
also blamed a college culture 
that encouraged binge drinking 
and sex and said it wasn’t just 
limited to Vanderbilt.

The closing arguments came 

after Batey took the stand and 
testified that he can’t remember 
the alleged sexual assault that 
prosecutors say he and three 
players carried out.

(AP) 
— 
More 
than 
35 

million 
people 
along 
the 

Philadelphia-to-Boston 
corridor rushed to get home 
and settle in Monday as 
a fearsome storm swirled 
in with the potential for 
hurricane-force winds and 1 
to 3 feet of snow that could 

paralyze the Northeast for 
days.

Snow 
was 
blowing 

sideways 
with 
ever-

increasing intensity in New 
York City by midafternoon 
as flurries began in Boston. 
Forecasters said the storm 
would build into a blizzard, 
and the brunt of it would 
hit late Monday and into 
Tuesday.

As the snow got heavier, 

much of the region rushed to 
shut down.

More than 6,500 flights 

in and out of the Northeast 
were canceled, and many of 
them may not take off again 
until 
Wednesday. 
Schools 

and businesses let out early. 
Government offices closed. 
Shoppers 
stocking 
up 
on 

food jammed supermarkets 
and elbowed one another 
for what was left. Broadway 
stages went dark.

“It’s going to be ridiculous 

out there, frightening,” said 
postal 
deliveryman 
Peter 

Hovey, standing on a snowy 
commuter train platform in 
White Plains, New York.

All too aware that big 

snowstorms can make or 
break politicians, governors 
and mayors moved quickly 
to declare emergencies and 
order the shutdown of streets 

and highways to prevent 
travelers 
from 
getting 

stranded and to enable plows 
and emergency vehicles to 
get through.

“This will most likely be 

one of the largest blizzards 
in the history of New York 
City,” New York Mayor Bill 
de Blasio warned.

He urged New Yorkers 

to go home and stay there, 
adding: 
“People 
have 
to 

make smart decisions from 
this point on.”

Up to now, this has been 

a largely snow-free winter 
in the urban Northeast. But 
this 
storm 
threatened 
to 

make up the difference in a 
single blow.

Boston was expected to get 

2 to 3 feet of snow, New York 
1½ to 2 feet and Philadelphia 
more than a foot. 

The 
National 
Weather 

Service issued a blizzard 
warning 
for 
a 
250-mile 

swath 
of 
the 
region, 

meaning 
heavy, 
blowing 

snow and potential whiteout 
conditions. 
Forecasters 

warned that the wind could 
gust to 75 mph or more along 
the Massachusetts coast and 
up 50 mph farther inland.

New York City’s subways 

and buses planned to shut 
down by 11 p.m.

relations while saying Native 
American culture should be

mention his hope that the new 
Legislature continues discussing 
a bill to add protections for 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender 
community 
to 

the state’s civil rights law. The 
measure died in November.

judge’s decision that overturned 
the state’s ban on same-sex mar-
riage — a decision that was put 
on hold to allow time for the 
appeal.

At least two same-sex couples 

sought and were refused mar-
riage licenses because of the 
delay, officials said, but there 
were no reports of widespread 
problems or confusion over the 
issue.

Attorney 
General 
Luther 

Strange’s 
office 
filed 
notice 

with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals in Atlanta saying it 
would challenge the ruling by 
U.S. District Judge Callie V.S. 
Granade of Mobile.

QATAR
Freed Al Qaeda 
agent was part of 
proposed swap for 
jailed Americans

Before he was released from a 

U.S. maximum-security prison 
last week, a confessed al Qaeda 
sleeper agent was offered up in 
a potential prisoner swap that 
would have freed two Americans 
held abroad.

According to two individu-

als with direct knowledge of 
the case, the proposition was 
made shortly after the Obama 
administration traded five Tali-
ban fighters for Army Sgt. Bowe 
Bergdahl. Those fighters were 
also sent to Qatar, where they’re 
to remain under government 
watch until later this year. U.S. 
officials have said they’re at 
risk of plotting further attacks 
against the United States.

plan during winter semester to 
address the topic.

Pollack said she is hopeful 

that the University’s efforts to 
reach out to high performance 
students 
from 
low-income 

areas, such as initiatives to 
waive application fees, will 
improve diversity on campus.

University funding was also 

a point of discussion. Noting 
that the majority of public 
higher education institutions 
face a challenge fiscal climate, 
Pollack cited state disinvest-
ment in higher education as a 
continuing challenge for pub-
lic colleges and universities.

“One thing that then hap-

pens is we become more reli-
ant on philanthropy,” Pollack 
said. “The future remains 
challenging and we’ll have 
to work together to address 
them.”

In recent years, the Univer-

sity has ramped up its private 
fundraising. 
In 
November 

2013, the University launched 
the Victors for Michigan cam-
paign. The fundraising effort 
is intended to raise $4 billion, 
a quarter of which will be ear-
marked for scholarships and 
other forms of financial assis-
tance.

During the session, Micro-

biology and Immunity Prof. 
Patrick Schloss asked how 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

higher 
education 
proposal 

— to make two years of com-
munity college free for many 
Americans — would impact 
the University.

Pollack responded that the 

more the federal government 
recognizes the value of higher 
education, the better. She said 
it is important that a Universi-
ty education can be affordable 
as well.

“If you’re an in-state stu-

dent from a low-income fam-
ily, a Michigan education can 
be essentially free,” Pollack 
said.

After Pollack concluded her 

presentation, the Assembly 
passed a resolution discour-
aging members from signing 
confidentiality agreements or 
orally agreeing to not disclose 
information from executive 
sessions.

In recent months, SACUA 

members have discussed con-
cerns related to confidentiality 
agreements, particularly the 
agreement for members of the 
University’s Advisory Board 
on Intercollegiate Athletics, 
the body charged with provid-
ing input to the University’s 
Athletic 
Department. 
The 

current confidentiality agree-
ment prevents members of the 
board from discussing con-
cerns with anyone apart from 
the University’s president.

Scott Masten, chair of the 

Senate 
Advisory 
Commit-

tee on University Affairs and 
a professor of business eco-
nomics and public policy, said 
assembly members are cur-
rently asked to serve on vari-
ous University committees 
or advisory boards. Because 
these policies or judgments 
can be sensitive in nature, 
SACUA proposed that con-
fidentiality only be invoked 
for compelling reasons, rath-
er than to avoid debate or 
accountability.

“Both I and SACUA object-

ed to the agreement as being 
excessively broad and restric-
tive, as well as to the fiduciary 
language” Masten wrote in a 
November e-mail interview. 
“We also felt that it conflicted 
with the spirit of the regents’ 
Bylaws, which provide for 
consultation between ABIA 
and SACUA and the Senate 
Assembly.”

The next Senate Assembly 

meeting will be held Feb. 16.

fered the damages were Tree-
tops Resort in Gaylord, Mich., 
and Boyne Highlands in Harbor 
Springs, Mich.

Treetops 
Resort 
manager 

Barry Owens said Friday the 
damages 
would 
likely 
total 

between $85,000 and $100,000.

In the letter, the three student 

leaders note that those respon-
sible will be held accountable 
and will make amends for their 
behavior.

“We will work to restore the 

good balance of our affiliates, 
and we will be looking for ways 
to begin repairing our relation-
ship and trust with each resort 
as well as the communities in 
northern Michigan,” the letter 
said.

The Michigan State Police is 

conducting an investigation on 

the events. Owens also said the 
resort plans to press charges and 
is awaiting the recommendation 
of the Michigan State Police to 
the prosecutor.

Both the Interfraternity Coun-

cil and the Panhellenic Associa-
tion are carrying out a review of 
the incidents.

University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
Office of Greek Life is in com-
munication with the local and 
national chapters of the Greek 
organizations 
involved. 
The 

Dean of Students Office has also 
been in contact with the two 
resorts that were damaged.

Fitzgerald said the implica-

tions of a suspension vary by 
national organization.

“This gives us the time and 

space to continue to gather facts 
and make sure that we under-
stand the details of the incident 
very clearly,” he said. “It’s more 
important to make sure we get 

the right information and move 
forward following our estab-
lished processes than to do it by 
a specific deadline.”

Sam Bessey, executive direc-

tor of the Chi Psi fraternity, said 
the University’s chapter can still 
live in the house, however while 
on suspension their social activi-
ties will be restricted.

Bessey did not provide a defi-

nite duration or timeline for the 
chapter’s suspension.

“The purpose of the suspen-

sion is to gives us an opportunity 
to investigate further and deter-
mine the best course of action,” 
Bessey said. “Once we have done 
that we will move forward in the 
way we feel is most appropriate.”

same brain pathway that 
could unlock new methods for 
addressing hypoglycemia, or 
low blood sugar.

“We’re looking at the neu-

rons that live downstream 
of these (CCK) because our 
thought is that those neurons 
are the ones that collect the 
signals from the system that 
we just studied, but then also 
from a whole bunch of sys-
tems,” Myers said. “Those are 
the ones that I think if we can 
figure out what’s in them, we 
can probably figure out a way 
to target some kind of thera-
peutic agent for hypoglyce-
mia.”

LSA junior Krysta Walter, 

president of Students for Dia-
betes Awareness, said type 1 
diabetes affects her life every 
day. To be prepared, for unex-
pected drops in blood glucose 
levels she said she must always 
carry her meter, glucose tab-

lets or a juice box.

Engineering senior Brianna 

Wolin was diagnosed with 
diabetes when she was four 
years old and said monitoring 
her insulin a critical part of 
her daily life.

“You could literally go 

into one day and eat exactly 
the same thing at the same 
time for every meal that you 
did the day before and have 
a completely different out-
come,” Wolin said. “It’s sort 
of the understanding that you 
always have to be on your toes, 
because if you were to relax 
for about more than five min-
utes, you could get yourself 
into a problem. You have to 
be hyper vigilant and aware 
because in five minutes, your 
entire existence could com-
pletely change.”

Scientists say this recent 

discovery could help people 
like Walter and Wolin who 
suffer from hypoglycemia and 
hope the research will contin-
ue to produce results.

heart transplant, as recipients 
of this device currently must 
be, but his ability to go home 
and be among his family for the 
holiday season is unique among 
eligible recipients.

“They could call me any day 

and tell me they’ve got that 
heart,” Larkin said. “Any day.”

Don Isaacs, vice president of 

communications for SynCardia 
Systems, Inc., said the timing 
was crucial.

“It’s a lot harder to bring back 

a patient who has already expe-
rienced damage versus getting 
our heart in there before the 
organs suffer any type of dam-
age,” Isaacs said.

The Freedom Driver weighs 

about 13 pounds and can be 
carried around in a backpack. 
SynCardia’s previous device 
weighed 418-pound.

The device is constantly 

pumping and makes consider-
able noise. It works by deliv-
ering compressed air into the 
ventricles through two tubes 
exiting the body.

Larkin said the machine 

took some getting used to.

“I had to get used to the 

tubes coming out of my stom-
ach,” he said. “I had no choice 
but to get used to it, but it’s 

helped me so far.”

Larkin said he was 16 when 

he collapsed at a basketball 
game and doctors discovered 
a condition called arrhythmo-
genic right ventricular dys-
plasia. Since then, his heart 
condition deteriorated until 
Nov. 7, 2014, when his heart 
was replaced with the Total 
Artificial Heart.

Isaacs said the Freedom 

Driver, which was approved 
by the FDA in June 2014 as a 
bridge to transplantation, is 
calibrated to function as a heart 
replacement.

“People don’t die from heart 

disease; they die from heart 
disease not providing enough 
blood and nutrition and oxy-
gen to the vital organs,” Isaacs 
said. 
“Biventricular 
failure 

means that both the left and 
right ventricles are going bad, 
so the point of our device is to 
prevent any damage to the vital 
organs.”

Haft said the device has 

proved beneficial so far.

“It’s not a burden for him,” 

Haft said. “He’s delighted to not 
have heart failure symptoms, 
and I think he’s enjoying his life 
out of the hospital, despite the 
extra effort that’s made to deal 
with the complexities of this 
equipment.”

Larkin, meanwhile, is just 

happy to just be out of the hospital.

The University of Califor-

nia, Los Angeles, for example, 
employs a policy to govern the 
ways in which the institution 
uses data collected during the 
admissions process, called the 
Policy on Access to Student Data. 
The policy allows access to stu-
dent data on a case-by-case basis 
as determined by the registrar’s 
office. The procedure also pro-
vides provisions for researchers 
and student organizations access-
ing data as well.

Hilton said the University con-

tinues to explore new uses for 
data analysis. The important part, 
he said, is to do so with the right 
policies and procedures in place.

“The question my office has 

been looking at isn’t about collect-
ing new data, it’s about using data 
already collected in new ways to 

improve learning,” Hilton said. 
“It’s about using data analytics to 
inform the classroom and doing 
that in ways that are secure and 
honor privacy expectations.”

However, some students and 

faculty have advised caution as 
the project moves forward.

Pharmaceutical 
Sciences 

Prof. David Smith, a member of 
SACUA, said while he believes the 
collection of data is a good initia-
tive and can benefit students, he 
is wary of the quality of collected 
data.

During Hilton’s SACUA pre-

sentation 
in 
August, 
Smith 

raised concerns about how a 
policy of optional data collec-
tion would create an unreliable 
data set.

“If you only get people who 

respond who do very well or very 
poorly, you don’t have a good rep-
resentative of the class and the 
data and interpretation would be 
skewed,” Smith said. “There has 

to be some way to determine if 
the data is really representing the 
group as a whole.”

LSA junior Michael Fakhoury 

said students providing data 
should have access to information 
about the process.

“If the University is using 

previously collected data, the 
students should be aware and 
consent that their information 
will be used as part of a study,” 
he said.

However, Hilton said the only 

way for the data collected by 
the University to be beneficial 
is if it is analyzed and used for 
research purposes.

“All of the data in the world, 

without 
asking 
questions 
or 

analysis, is useless,” Hilton said. 
“Large data sets render up a 
whole lot of questions. A lot of 
people think that data automati-
cally answers a lot of questions, 
but it doesn’t. You have to figure 
it out.”

I have been taught that racism is 

over. It’s no longer a problem, so it’s 
time to stop whining about it. “We 
have a Black president!” “I don’t see 
color!” “Everyone faces challenges 
in life, not just minorities!”

In light of the lack of indictment 

in the Michael Brown case this past 
November, and in light of the many 
other black victims of police violence, 
I would like to disagree. Racism is 
real and present, and it is dangerous.

It seems that most people in the 

United States agree that racism is 
bad. People were outraged when 
racial slurs were hurled at current 
Michigan quarterback Devin Gard-
ner, the n-word is pretty much off 
limits for non-Blacks, and the gen-
eral consensus is that the KKK has 
no place in our society. No one wants 
to be labeled a racist.

I am a biracial Black woman, and 

I have hidden behind the privilege of 
being light-skinned. I have distanced 
myself from what it means to be 
Black in America. But when cashiers 
at the grocery store always ask my 
Black mother for her ID but never my 
white father, I can’t remain separate. 
When Black friends speak of being 
followed in department stores, I can’t 
distance myself. When I see peers 
post on Facebook that “it’s not about 
race” and remember specific times 
that I’ve heard each of them make 
derogatory racial comments, I can’t 
ignore it.

It seems like we are not all on the 

same page in terms of what racism 
really means. By definition, racism is 
the belief that certain racial groups 
are inferior to others, accompanied 
and legitimized by historical ineq-
uity and unequal power dynamics. 
Racism is not only racial slurs, or 
housing discrimination or not hir-
ing someone for a job because of their 
race. It’s the perceptions held by the 
group in power and the actions that 
result from those perceptions.

Racism is very hard to recognize 

and very easy to internalize. Biases 
are stronger than we give them 
credit for. They linger in the back-
ground of our lives, quietly whisper-
ing messages that cause us to lean 
certain ways.

I’ll give the example of Black 

representation in the media. When 
Black people are mentioned in news 
stories, the story often contains the 
words “thug,” “animal” or other 
dehumanizing terms. Hearing these 
representations over and over cre-
ates the racist idea that Black peo-
ple are dangerous. But those exact 

words will never be uttered aloud, 
so the racism behind those thoughts 
will never be acknowledged.

And then you watch movies or 

flip on the TV, and Black characters, 
or any characters of color, are rare. 
If they are present, they are often 
supporting someone white, or play 
an insignificant role. My roommate 
last year prefaced a question with, 
“I’m not trying to be racist…” and 
then asked why there were “Black” 
movies, and why Black Entertain-
ment Television got its own channel. 
I explained to her that the rest of 
popular culture could accurately be 
called “White Entertainment Tele-
vision.” One study showed that out 
of all movies produced in 2012, the 
proportion of black characters fea-
tured was 70 percent less than that 
of the Black population in the United 
States. Black people are unimport-
ant and unappealing.

These notions are subtly spread 

from person to person. After a bas-
ketball game where my primarily 
white high school faced a primarily 
Black high school, my high school 
friends ogled at how “Maddie’s 
talking to those Black guys!” Black 
men are scary. Over the summer, 
another student in my internship 
talked about how a bar “had great 
reviews on Yelp, but when I went in 
there were all these homeless Black 
guys!” Black people are poor and do 
not belong in the same circles as me. 
When a group of Black U of M stu-
dents arrived at a house party I was 
attending, the host suddenly decid-
ed there were too many people and 
it was time for the party to end. I do 
not want dangerous Black people in 
my house. I don’t know how many of 
my friends have joked about getting 
shot in “ghetto Detroit.” Black cities 
are violent.

Every Black person I know has 

been followed by employees while 
shopping in a store. Black people are 
criminals. I, and other Black friends, 
have been told by white peers that 
it was “easier” for us to get into that 
school, or to get that job offer, as if 
we are unqualified but were given a 
boost by our skin color. Black people 
are unintelligent.

So many Black people have had 

negative 
experiences 
with 
the 

police. In the first half of 2014, out 
of all those stopped because of New 
York City’s “Stop and Frisk” prac-
tice, 53 percent were black, where-
as Blacks represent only 25 percent 
of the New York City population. 
Black people are suspicious. Black 

people are up to no good.

But no one said the n-word, 

no one said a slur, so these many 
instances were not recognized as 
racism. And this is a huge problem. 
When a problematic behavior is 
being exhibited, yet people are con-
stantly affirming themselves that it 
is not problematic, the behavior is 
encouraged and continues. Deny-
ing the existence of racism is actu-
ally promoting and perpetuating it.

It’s hard to admit it, for fear of 

being labeled racist, but everyone 
has biases. And when you acknowl-
edge this fact, you can actively work 
against it. However, ignoring biases 
causes action that is much more 
serious than crossing the street 
when a Black person approaches 
 

at night.

All of these biases compound and 

lead to violence. I do not believe 
that when an unarmed Black man 
or woman, or in the case of Tamir 
Rice — an unarmed Black boy — is 
killed by the police, that the police 
officer simply shoots them “because 
they are Black.” And I do not deny 
that there is also police brutal-
ity against whites, and every other 
race.

But I do believe that years of 

internalized racism have caused 
distrust 
and 
fear 
toward 
the 

Black community. And these sub-
conscious, but still racist, biases 
cause the officer to be more suspi-
cious, more on edge, more afraid, 
if a person were Black than if they 
were white. They are more likely 
to expect violence and to assume 
criminal activity, they are more 
likely to respond with excessive 
force. They are quicker to draw 
their weapon. They are quicker 
to shoot.

It is unproductive to pretend 

that racism is not a problem. It is 
unproductive to continually treat 
each time the police murder a Black 
person as an isolated incident. It 
is unproductive to think that just 
because racism doesn’t happen to 
you, it doesn’t happen.

Until we change our culture, until 

we stop perpetuating stereotypes 
through the media, until we reject 
internalized racism, nothing will 
change. Until we can label our biases 
as what they really are, until we can 
name racism, there will be another 
Aura Rosser, another Tamir Rice, 
another Michael Brown.

The danger in denying racism

I

t is five degrees below zero. 
There are about three blocks 
between where I currently am 

and 
the 
warm, 

toasty interior of 
Sweetwaters where 
I’m headed. I sprint 
as fast as I can 
down State Street 
because, 
though 

the wind may be 
a 
whiplash, 
to 

sulk and shiver 
idly 
would 
be 

an 
even 
more 

aggravated, 
elongated torture.

In my tunnel-visioned hurry, I 

sweep past figure after hooded fig-
ure nested in the nook of each street 
corner. They are the same homeless 
people who are there every day, 
except today their hands are folded 
inward from the cold. I don’t real-
ize that their involuntary immo-
bility, the exact one I try to avoid, 
must make the needle-sting of the 
cold hurt that much more.

When I finally arrived in the 

comfort of my destination — over-
priced coffee in hand — I read an 
article that slapped me harder than 
the wind chill did. In 1973, John 
M. Darley and C. Daniel Batson of 
Princeton 
University 
published 

“From Jerusalem to Jericho,” a 
piece in the Journal of Personal-
ity and Social Psychology. In their 
study, they analyze the way our 
egocentric society alienates those 
out on the street. However, they 
explain how it’s our self-absorption 
and consequent lack of awareness 
that prompts us to not acknowledge 
the needy, even when they are by 
our feet. As they sum up, “Ethics 
becomes a luxury as the speed of 
our daily lives increases.”

As individuals, we have all become 

increasingly busy, cramming activi-
ties and meetings into our sched-
ules until the white spaces on our 
calendars disappear. We are always 
hurrying everywhere; to events we 
will perpetually be late to — even 
on Michigan time. As we rush to 
our destinations, our heads are bent 
down — if not in cold, then immersed 
in the egocentric universe of our 
smartphones. Our Facebook statuses 
are always “on the go,” our tweets 
complain about how we’re always on 
the go and our GPS destinations are 
forever nomadic. In our self-centered 
worlds, we forget about everyone else 
around us, because we — me, myself, 
I — need to keep going, going, going…

I am from Boston, born and 

raised, and I harbor an East Coast 
mentality that puts me in an eter-
nal state of self-centered hurry. At 
North Station, you will be trampled 
if you intend on slowing the sea of 
traffic. Growing up, my parents and 
teachers always taught me to avert 
my eyes forward, focus on my desti-
nation and ignore all beggars on the 
street because they most likely have 
adverse intentions with your money.

Now, I reflect on my first day at 

Michigan, my first stroll through 
downtown Ann Arbor with a Mit-
ten-native friend. As we passed 
rows of homeless men and women 
lounging on the cement, I noticed 
that my friend nodded at each per-
son who made eye contact, while I 
desperately avoided any connection. 
When explicitly asked for money — 
whether in a rough or gentle tone 
— he politely declined, apologized 
or simply said, “have a nice day.” 
Regardless, what astounded me was 
that he simply acknowledged their 
presence. He was able to reach the 
same “destination” as me, without a 
penny fewer from his pocket, but he 
validated the efforts and existence 

of these fellow human beings.

That day, I felt strange seeing my 

friend act with a kindness toward 
strangers who I didn’t quite under-
stand, but I knew I was not the only 
one. As Darley and Batson under-
line, “A person (sees) another, con-
sciously (notes) his distress, and 
consciously (chooses) to leave him 
in distress … The empathic reac-
tions usually associated with that 
interpretation (have) been deferred 
because they (are) hurrying … 
Because of the time pressures, they 
(do) not perceive the scene as an 
occasion for an ethical decision.”

So, by perpetually being in a 

hurry, have we made ourselves less 
empathetic as basic humans? It is 
our hurry that makes us more self-
ish, less aware — and I guess, by 
default, less compassionate.

I am not overtly wealthy and I 

unfortunately do not have change 
or resources to give every homeless 
person I encounter. It will be dif-
ficult to loosen our schedules, slow 
our perpetual rush or eradicate our 
fascination with our mobile devices. 
Each person I meet on the street 
may also not have genuine inten-
tions or altruistic means when ask-
ing for money.

However, at the core, we are all 

one and the same — trying to get 
somewhere with our lives. We are 
all human beings who deserve to be 
treated as such, regardless of wheth-
er we are squatting or standing on 
the pavement. A simple nod or “have 
a nice day” will not actually hinder 
me on my way to my destination, 
nor will it make the biting wind any 
softer. Regardless, I’m quite sure the 
cold is much harsher on their end of 
the sidewalk.

We’ve become coldhearted

T

he Ann Arbor City Council approved a resolution plan on Jan. 
20 regarding the city’s protocol for handling homeless camps. 
The plan was developed in response to Forestbrooke residents’ 

complaints that a camp has grown in size since last summer, causing a 
disturbance on private property. According to Councilmember Stephen 
Kunselman (D–Ward 3), neighbors had previously been using the 
private property as a community area. The now-evicted homeless camp, 
known as Camp Serenity, was one of the several establishments in Ann 
Arbor where displaced citizens have set up tents and created a sense of 
community. The city responded appropriately to these complaints by 
evicting the members whose tents were on private property. Now, City 
Council is considering a more proactive plan to relocate those living 
under such conditions. Beyond working on short-term solutions, the 
city needs to develop a more thorough eviction plan that works to curb 
the systemic issues facing the city’s homeless population.

Kunselman has made it clear that this is not 

an issue to which Ann Arbor can turn a blind 
eye. The homeless population is very present 
in Washtenaw County with a population 
estimated between 3,000 and 4,000 people. 
Clearly, 
for 
many 
campers, 
relocation 

is not realistic. Along with significant 
transportation issues to shelters that make 
many of them inaccessible, these shelters 
also suffer from a lack of available resources. 
For example, the Delonis Center only has 75 
beds for its year-round residential program. 
Furthermore, homeless citizens might have 
difficulty capitalizing on assistance due to 
anxiety or other mental disorders.

Earlier this month, the Ann Arbor 

Downtown Development Authority voted to 
pursue an ambassador program that would 
put paid ambassadors on the streets to help 
the homeless and mentally ill, although 
that role is not clearly defined. While street 
monitors may be helpful in identifying issues 
of safety or pointing out individuals who need 
help, the money allocated, approximately 
$300,000, would be better spent directly 
on initiatives that directly improve the 
circumstances surrounding the homeless 

population’s condition. Services such as 
educational programs, career workshops, 
psychiatric services, and drug and alcohol 
abuse treatment are all resources shelters 
must have in order to begin to change the 
 

systematic issue.

Another long-term problem is the lack of 

affordable housing in Ann Arbor. The high costs 
of housing make it difficult even for employed 
homeless people to pay for housing and 
reintegrate back into society. Highridge Costa 
Housing Partners had plans to build affordable 
housing units in 2007 on the property where 
Camp Serenity was located . The project has 
not been successful because the developer has 
not been able to obtain highly competitive, 
low-income tax credits granted by the state.

These problems will not dissipate if the 

council chooses to ignore or respond with 
eviction only after receiving complaints, 
which 
is 
what 
happened 
with 
Camp 

Serenity. In order to relocate the homeless 
off private property and into caring hands, 
councilmembers 
must 
create 
attainable 

options rather than waiting until they are 
forced to evict campers who are, quite 
frankly, stuck in the muck.

Develop a plan on homelessness

FROM THE DAILY

MARGARET DECKER | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

I 

was once volunteering at an elemen-
tary school in Ypsilanti when a teacher 
told me that it is impossible to feel safe 

if your basic needs are not 
taken care of. She then said 
that more than 50 percent 
of her students don’t have 
their basic needs met. The 
question I continue turning 
over in my head is, “what are you privileged 
to think about when you don’t need to think 
about your health, safety and basic needs?” 
Sometimes I feel like my mind is liberated 
and I am living in the biggest and best game 
of “make believe.” Even though my heart 
aches every time I see someone less fortunate 
than me, I also recognize that I am the only 
person I can control, so that will have to do. I 
do not think I am unique in this idea; in fact, 
I have met many amazing individuals who 
seem to have this same sense of liberation. 
The commonality that strings us together is 
our desire to help people, create change and 
make an impact.

The buzzword “social entrepreneurship” 

has been floating across campus and ring-
ing in my ears for a while now. The group 
optiMize, a student-driven social innovation 
movement that spans the University campus, 
seeks to bring creative and socially driven 
individuals together. Patrick Tonks, associ-
ate director of the Institute for Humanities, 
has jumpstarted a University-funded collec-
tion of student interest groups that similarly 
gather students to talk about what really mat-
ters. Additionally, TechArb, a student start-
up accelerator, has similarly gathered a pool 
of students doing new and important things. 
The avenues are clearly there, and even with-
out the guidance of these accelerator pro-
grams, many students have found sustenance 
in providing needs across campus and within 
the Ann Arbor community. Coffee clubs, book 
clubs, art shows and pop-up competitions 
are appearing out of thin air. It is prevalent 
and important work that is allowing Univer-
sity students to learn outside of the structure 
of a classroom and moreover, to find issues or 
needs that are particular to their individual and 
unique outlook on life.

I met with Max Steir, a 2013 University 

graduate and co-owner of Salads UP on East 
Liberty Street, and he had important wisdom 
to impart on students who plan on participat-
ing in similar ventures. After realizing that 
Ann Arbor lacked a healthy salad restaurant, 
he and a friend designed the new shop. The 
restaurant emanates sustainable and environ-
mentally conscious efforts. From the locally 
sourced food to the reclaimed wood, the space 
radiates with a positive mission. Although the 
result is a rewarding experience, the process 
has its ebbs and flows. Steir said, “You have 
to deal with the fear of not exactly knowing 
when you are going to get your money back, 
but that you spent enough to know that you 
will get it back and that much more, and most 
importantly, that your operation will turn into 
exactly what you envisioned.”

It is important not to compromise one’s 

beliefs, but rather to see the project through.

Engineering senior Alex Ottenwess, who is 

majoring in industrial engineering and com-
puter science, is embarking on a different path 
of entrepreneurship from a more tech-savvy 
angle. With the guidance of TechArb, Otten-
wess and fellow teammates have designed an 
app called Wiz. Its purpose is to start connect-
ing students to others in the classroom. He 
said, “It stemmed from a need I had in a lot of 
my big lecture and engineering courses where 
it would be 200 people, and I wouldn’t really 
get to know any of them. There is a big bar-
rier to get to know people, but when I did find 
them, I really saw improvement in my under-
standing.” Wiz aims to open the doors of com-
munication and interaction among classmates.

These tokens of wisdom from students our 

age are inspiring and accessible. It takes the 
support of every member of a community to 
see progress, but it also takes the motivation 
that our student body has to offer. If one is 
fortunate enough to be liberated from basic 
fears of safety and health, it seems that posi-
tive impact and solutions for change can now 
occupy part of one’s mind. Every entrepreneur 
has a different story to tell and there is no 
perfect mold, but if one is able to make the 
change they would like to see, it becomes so 
much more possible than it would be if they 
were passively watching time go by. It is our 
duty to bring these issues to the surface so 

DANI
VIGNOS

If you knew you couldn’t fail

we can spark the change. As Otten-
wess attested, “A lot of people have 
great ideas for change, but never 
put them into action, and it remains 
just an idea. When you can take 
that little leap of faith, even if it’s 
really small, that is something put 

into action. It’s not going to change 
the world necessarily, but a lot of 
people struggle to make that initial 
leap of faith.”

I’m staring at a postcard my 

mom wrote me when I was in a 
freshman spell of sadness. Its says, 

“What would you attempt to do if 
you knew you could not fail?” If you 
are able, try to answer this question 
and do nothing short of that.

‘Boy Next Door’ 
successful camp

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

I have many leather-bound books (and first editions of The Iliad).

Self-aware film 
brings laughs as 
well as thrills

 

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

“The Boy Next Door” has all the 

ingredients of cinematic garbage. 
The January release date, the $4 
million budget 
that was appar-
ently 
spent 

solely on per-
fect salon blow-
outs 
for 
J.Lo 

and bad digital 
rain 
effects, 

the dialogue so 
heavy-handed 
and 
ridiculous 

that the screen-
writer obviously hasn’t even seen a 
movie, let alone written one — you 
don’t even need to know that “The 
Boy Next Door” has an 11 percent 
rating on Rotten Tomatoes to 
know that this movie isn’t going to 
win any awards.

But “The Boy Next Door” is 

aware of exactly what kind of 
movie it is. It takes its trashiness in 
stride, embracing all the elements 
that should make it objectively bad 
and spinning crap into pure enter-
tainment.

Jennifer Lopez (“Monster-in-

Law”) plays Claire Peterson, a 
high-school English teacher with a 
needy teenage son and a husband 
who cheats but is really sorry about 
it. J.Lo is actually a very talented 
actress, and it’s a shame that this 
role doesn’t give her much to work 
with. But Lopez is naturally like-
able, and the fact that she carries 

her historically rom-com oeurve 
wherever she goes adds another 
dimension to the plot. For the first 
twenty minutes of the film, the 
audience is just waiting for her 
Channing Tatum type to show up 
and sweep her off her feet.

That Channing Tatum type 

stand-in is handsome new neigh-
bor Noah (Ryan Guzman, “Step 
Up: All In”), who, immediately 
upon moving in with his sick 
uncle, shows up to Claire’s house 
to fix her car and make her blush. 
Their chemistry is irresistible, 
despite the fact that Claire’s awk-
ward son is still hanging around 
and that titular “boy next door” 
is only 19 years old. Noah is drop-
dead gorgeous with emphasis on 
the “drop dead,” youthful and for-
bidden and a little dangerous, but 
all the more appealing because of 
it.

... Until he becomes just plain 

terrifying. Guzman plays the 
switch from sweetheart neigh-
bor to lethal stalker surprisingly 
well; he literally becomes a roar-
ing, bloodied, vengeful monster 
in front of our eyes. His irrational 
actions are never really explained 
(beyond the fact that he has a “bad 
temper” and a history of violence), 
but that makes some scenes all 
the more terrifying, since the 
audience sees events unfold from 
Claire’s point of view. When she 
slept with Noah, Claire had no 
idea that he was a master hacker, 
fighter and all-around criminal 
mastermind. With each new rev-
elation at how far Noah will go to 
enact his vengeance, we’re still 
completely in the dark as to his 
motivations or what he’ll do next. 
Whether or not this effect was 
intentional, it’s genuine suspense.

But though “The Boy Next 

Door” adds up to an entertain-
ing, somehow coherent whole, its 
parts are still hilariously trashy. 
The writing is just horrendous, 
alternating between awkward, 
out-of-place dialogue (J.Lo telling 
her son to wipe the “schmutz” off 
his face during dinner, because 
apparently her lexicon features a 
fair amount of Yiddish) and word-
less fight scenes. Most of the sub-
plots just don’t make any sense, 
like why Claire’s son is bullied for 
having allergies and why he has 
an allergy attack while boxing. 
Actually, very little in this movie 
makes sense logically. How did 
Noah get a first edition copy of 
The Iliad? Why does it look like a 
book of fairytales? Why did Noah 
get expelled from school, and 
why does the movie make such a 
big deal out of that without even 
attempting to provide an answer? 
What’s the purpose of all those 
Greek epic allusions unless it was 
all leading to the moment when a 
metaphorical cyclops got stabbed 
in the eye with an EpiPen?

“The Boy Next Door” doesn’t 

want to be thought provoking. 
It assumes that every viewer is 
going into this theater to see a 
dollar-store remake of “Fatal 
Attraction.” It assumes you’re 
there to laugh and stare at Ryan 
Guzman’s chest and pay $10 to 
watch it, because the movie only 
needs to sell a couple tickets to 
make a profit off its microscopic 
budget. But through all its absur-
dity and thoughtlessness, the 
movie remains wildly fun and 
fast-paced, even bringing a few 
nuggets of real thrills and sus-
pense. “The Boy Next Door” is 
a beautiful, trashy, hot mess of a 
movie, and it’s pretty damn proud 
of itself.

Timeless ‘Evil’ shines

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Note: This review contains 

major spoilers for the Finale of 
“American Horror Story: Freak 
Show.”

Well, 
that 

went downhill. 

The 
pre-

miere 
of 

“Freak Show” 
had 
promise: 

a 
potentially 

terrifying con-
cept, 
which 

called back to 
the cult classic 
“Freaks,” filled 
with opportu-
nities for social 
reflection. But 
then the train really went off the 
rails with never-ending preoccu-
pation with unnecessary charac-
ters and subplots. One week it was 
a weird mash-up of ’50s horror 
and “Glee”-style musical num-
bers, the next, Neil Patrick Har-
ris (“How I Met Your Mother”) 
showed up. 

Salvaging a broken product 

was all that the finale “Curtain 
Call” could do. It opens with psy-
chopathic Dandy (Finn Wittrock, 
“Unbroken”) in charge of the titu-
lar freak show after Elsa Mars 
(Jessica Lange, “Big Fish”) aban-
doned it to pursue her dreams of 
Hollywood stardom. How will the 
freaks respond and survive with a 
character that can be turned into 
a killer at a drop of a hat?

“Not very long” is the answer, 

as it takes all but 15 minutes into 
the finale before Dandy goes off 
on a shooting spree in the camp, 
and there’s not a bit of surprise to 
it. Dandy snapping on the freaks 
was inevitable, but having it hap-
pen so soon killed any illusion of 
dread or suspense along with the 
majority of the freak show. 

The well-shot massacre should 

have been terrifying, but it was 
too clear who was going to live 
and who was going to die. If the 
cast member was part of the 

repertoire of “American Horror 
Story” regulars, they were just 
fine. The side characters, like 
Paul (Mat Fraser, “Cast Offs”), 
were just there for the body count 
and were doomed from the start. 
According to “AHS,” Angela Bas-
sett (“ER”) ’s three breasts are just 
sexier than real-life disabilities.

But even with its failings, “Cur-

tain Call” was still able to wrap up 
several important threads. Dan-
dy’s death was fitting, even with 
the ham-fisted “You are the big-
gest freak of all time!” line thrown 
in to remind viewers that you 
shouldn’t judge a book by its cover 
– if that wasn’t already painfully 
obvious.

But there was more than a half 

hour left in an already bloated 
runtime. And with a flash for-
ward, “American Horror Story” 
became 
“The 
Jessica 
Lange 

Show,” and a passable finale to 
a disappointing season became 
insulting.

In 1960, Elsa has become the 

“Queen of Friday Night” with a 
variety show and everything else 
she wanted, despite the fact that 
the show has, on multiple occa-
sions, pointed out that Elsa isn’t 
that talented. Despite her suc-
cess, Elsa is lonely. “I’m bored,” 
she says at one point, echoing my 
exact sentiments.

With her career facing ruin as 

her past catches up with her, Elsa 
decides to perform on Hallow-

een. This is an obvious excuse for 
Edward Mordrake (Wes Bentley, 
“The Hunger Games”) and his 
ghostly crew to show up again 
and kill her on stage. This sea-
son, Elsa has sold a character into 
slavery, killed her best friend and 
sold her freak show to not one, but 
two madmen leading to most of 
the freaks’ deaths. So what pun-
ishment awaits her? Nothing. All 
is forgiven as Ethel (Kathy Bates, 
“Misery”) greets Elsa in freak 
show heaven. The explanation? 
“It’s like you always said, sweet-
heart: ‘Stars never pay.’” 

Bullshit! An ending where the 

bad guys win is fine, but this was 
something else — this was a despi-
cable character who got every-
thing she wanted, still wasn’t 
happy and was rewarded with 
undeserved salvation. At no point 
did Elsa do anything redemptive 
or possess the necessary self-
awareness to earn the ending she 
got. The audience is served up an 
ill-advised love letter to star Jes-
sica Lange from series’ creators 
Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. 
This odd adoration spits in the 
face of the show’s own logic, 
which has condemned similar 
characters (in the same episode) 
for many of the sins Elsa has com-
mitted. 

The ending basically says, 

“Yeah this is a mess, but isn’t Jes-
sica Lange just the greatest?” 

No. Just no.

Like it or not, re-releasing old 

titles has become an institution in 
the video game industry. As games 
become increas-
ingly complex, 
they’re 
also 

increasingly 
expensive 
to 

make. 
Sales 

numbers 
for 

re-releases 
of 

games are sur-
prisingly solid, 
even when com-
pared to their 
original release sales numbers. 
Re-releases just make financial 
sense for developers and publish-
ers — they can cash in on past 
popular titles for minimal rede-
velopment time and cost.

In 2014 alone, we saw upgraded 

re-releases of “Pokémon,” “Grand 
Theft Auto,” “Halo” and “Tomb 
Raider” games hit the market. 
Now, for the first video game re-
release of 2015, it’s the seminal 
survival horror game “Resident 
Evil.”

Wait … doesn’t this sound 

familiar?

It should, because “Resident 

Evil” already had its turn. Six 
times. “Resident Evil (2015)” 
marks the seventh time the 1996 
classic has been re-released in 
some form. So how is this week’s 
“Resident Evil” ’s release at all rel-
evant?

To put it simply, it’s because the 

game is still fantastic; “Resident 
Evil” is a game that each genera-
tion of gamers should play. It’s still 
scary. It’s more beautiful than 
ever. It’s meatier and much more 
memorable than the vast majority 
of video games released today.

For the uninitiated, “Resident 

Evil” is an extremely influential 
survival horror game, pioneering 
gameplay mechanics that would 
be genre staples for years to come.

“Resident Evil” ’s genius is its 

revolutionary use of restriction to 
instill fear in players. It was among 
the first games to limit the player’s 
ammo and the number of times 
they could save, and was certainly 
the first to use these restrictions 
fairly and effectively. This com-
bination of limiting factors forced 
frantic resource management and 
a pervading feeling that at any 
given moment, you might not have 
enough stuff to survive.

Another restriction in “Resi-

dent Evil” is its camera, which 
aims in fixed angles depending 
on the location of the player in 
the room. This allows the game to 
hide scares extremely effectively 
and makes for some interesting 
visual puzzles. The game is full of 
puzzles — actual interesting, com-
plex puzzles — which mainstream 
video games seem to avoid at all 
costs lately.

Perhaps the only thing wrong 

with the original “Resident Evil” 
was the time and place it came 
out. The 1996 Playstation version 

looks, well, terrible compared to 
today’s popular hits. Its simple 
polygonal characters move stati-
cally and the game relies too heav-
ily on FMV (real video of real 
actors — yeah, it was real bad). It’s 
aged worse than almost any other 
classic game with similar levels of 
acclaim.

In 
2002, 
“Resident 
Evil” 

received a remake (note that 
remakes are more effortful ven-
tures than re-releases that alter 
the way an old game looks or plays) 
on Gamecube. This remake was so 
good that it made the original look 
completely unplayable by compar-
ison. It completely overhauled the 
graphics, sound and cutscenes of 
the original, giving the cutscenes 
in particular a slick CGI treatment 
instead of FMV.

“Resident Evil (2015)” is an HD 

upgrade of that game. Now, it’s 
playable in widescreen HD, with a 
new, optional control scheme that 
upgrades the archaic tank-like 
controls that plagued the 2002 
treatment.

The only knock on this game 

is that the CG cutscenes weren’t 
upgraded to HD like everything 
else, so they feel very out of place. 
Otherwise, this is the very best 
version of a seminal video game. 
If “Resident Evil” doesn’t already 
occupy a spot in your collection, 
there has never been a better time 
to change that.

“Resident Evil” was reviewed 

using an advance digital copy pro-
vided by the publisher.

‘The Fall’ enthralls

By KIM BATCHELOR

Daily Arts Writer

Finally, 
the 
long-awaited 

sophomore season of the Irish 
crime drama “The Fall” has hit 
Netflix. 
The 

series focuses 
on the cat-and-
mouse 
chase 

of serial killer 
Paul 
Spector 

(Jamie 
Dor-

nan, 
“Fifty 

Shades 
of 

Grey”) by the 
Belfast police, led by Detec-
tive Superintendent Stella Gib-
son (Gillian Anderson, “The 
X-Files”). This season brings the 
pair much closer until they are 
practically on top of each other 
– literally.

The premiere picks up almost 

exactly where the season one 
finale left off. The episode’s dark 
themes are beautifully echoed 
in the low lighting and muted 
tones, and characters are often 
only silhouetted by single-point 
light. The music and dialogue 
are similarly hushed, with large 
swaths of silence where nothing 
can be heard but the sounds of 
breathing. This sets the mood for 
the whole season to come — dark 
and dangerous — but not like a 
fast explosion. Rather, it is slow 
and creeping, silent and deadly, 
like a concealed dagger. And, in 
case we’d forgotten over the hia-
tus, we are quickly reminded of 
the eerie feeling that no one is 
ever safe. Finally, the dramatic 
turn from slow burn to sudden 
attack at the end pushes the 
show forward.

The real high points of the 

episode are the character inter-
actions. Paul’s love for his daugh-
ter, Olivia (newcomer Sarah 
Beattie) is soured by the use of 
his skills as a murderer to com-
fort her. His kind smile toward 

Rose Stagg’s daughter (Valene 
Kane, “Jump”) before his kidnap 
is purposefully jarring. Never-
theless, it is the women of the 
episode who steal the show. Ais-
ling Franciosi’s (“Quirke”) char-
acter, Katie Benedetto, gains 
complexity as a character and 
develops from innocent bystand-
er to fully immersed in the thrill. 
In Stella’s interview, Karen Has-
san (“Hollyoaks”) ’s poignant 
performance in her role as a 
survivor of one of Paul’s attacks, 
paints a believable picture of not 
only a murder survivor, but a 
sexual violence survivor.

This season, even more so 

than the previous one, employs 
the practice of surveillance and 
the feeling of being watched. 
This theme carries out with the 
installation of cameras in the 
Spectors’ home, the videotap-
ing of victims and Paul’s secret 
observation of Stella. This makes 
many intimate moments pub-
lic, and it forces viewers to face 
their own positions as voyeurs in 
these people’s lives. At one point, 
we are even called out as specta-
tors, when Spector asks “Why 
are you watching this? You sick 
fuck!”

“The Fall” also relies on some 

strong 
cinematography. 
This 

season continues the trend of 
visual doubling — the use of mir-
ror images and juxtaposition of 
everyday actions with those of 
sinister intent. The visuals are 
written into the plot at the very 
level of the character’s personal-
ities. Where Stella is clinical and 
Paul is sensual, both are sexual 
beings who strive for complete 
control in their lives. It is these 
similarities that allow them to 
get in the other’s head, constant-
ly outdoing the other, and driv-
ing the show.

Dornan’s soft-spoken serial 

killer, Paul, is slowly losing his 
humanity with his separation 

from his family, which he plays 
with subtle and cold dead eyes. 
Meanwhile, Stella is warming 
up, with Anderson opening up 
cracks in her armor and bringing 
out real emotional depth. Addi-
tionally, Stella is the Queen of 
the inversion of the Male Gaze, 
using the men around her to her 
advantage. The supporting char-
acters are further fleshed out in 
this season as well. John Lynch’s 
(“Black Death”) character, Assis-
tant Chief Constable Jim Burns, 
provides a wonderful example 
of a man who is tired of a job he 
has been in for too long, while 
Niamh Mcgrady (“Holby City”) 
and provides his counter as an 
ingénue who still sees the best in 
people with her character, Police 
Constable Danielle Ferrington.

A new addition to the team 

is the young and upstart Detec-
tive Sergeant Tom Anderson 
(Colin Morgan, “Merlin”) who is 
described as both promising and 
attractive – both things true of 
the character and the actor who 
plays him. It will be interesting 
to see where his character goes 
in the next season, especially 
with the parallel lines drawn 
between him and Spector.

The season wasn’t without 

its shortcomings. Unlike its 
predecessor, season two felt 
the need to spell out the visual 
comparisons it made verbally. 
This aspect has not only weak-
ened one of the show’s greatest 
strengths, but underestimated 
the audience’s ability to figure 
it out on their own. “The Fall” is 
the kind of show meant to make 
you think, and to dumb it down 
is to patronize those who enjoy 
the challenge of a good puzzle.

Overall, season two does not 

lose momentum and honors its 
strongest points: the complex 
characters who are portrayed 
with depth and respect by the 
talented cast.

Swedish film 
dissects tense 
family drama

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Sounds seem, and maybe are, 

louder in isolation — screech-
ing tires, a baby wailing, an ava-
lanche. Such is 
the model with-
in which Swed-
ish 
filmmaker 

Ruben Östlund 
(“Play”) 
works 

in 
his 
some-

times 
absurd, 

funny in a look-
away-kind-of-
way exercise in 
family drama set in the quietude 
of a tiny Alps ski resort. And it’s 
really quiet — from the hissing of 
skis down an unpopulated run to 
the sun-kissed mountains playing 
with sleepy zephyrs. It’s also gor-
geous. The terrain, the Kubrick-
ian ritzy hotel and, of course, the 
family of four, in their matching, 
tailored baby-blue pajamas and 
blemish-free skin, on which the 
film centers. Doubtless, Östlund 
might have one of the tightest 
grips on naturalistic familiality 
I’ve seen — like when Mom’s so 
mad at Dad, she actually laughs.

The film title’s thematic signifi-

cance becomes apparent within 
minutes (“force majeure” means 
someone fails to uphold a con-
tract when something unforesee-
able happens): while lunching on 
a hillside with a marvelous view, 
a distant “controlled” avalanche 
suddenly becomes not so dis-
tant or controlled. Diners begin 

to freak, screaming and running 
for dear life. The father, Tomas 
(winsome newcomer Johannes 
Bah Kuhnke), on instinct, nabs 
his iPhone and shades, then bolts, 
ignoring his two young children 
and wife Ebba (played by lissome 
rookie Lisa Loven Kongsli), who 
blankets her children like a moth-
er should. The result is anything 
but cataclysmic — no injuries, no 
trauma, just a few snow-dusted 
butter plates. Tomas returns to 
the family table moments later, 
but, with deft subtlety, the table is 
so far from “family” that we don’t 
even know what it is. The emo-
tional maelstrom begins to whirl.

The implicit tension amid the 

family hurts and is hard to watch. 
Östlund slices these moments 
with a few smart tools: Hyperki-
netic baroque music akin to a Wes 
Anderson film and noiseless chair-
lift rides that let us breathe, prep-
ping for the next teeth-clencher. It 
doesn’t feel entirely unique, it just 
feels right — Östlund has a gut for 

this fusion of well-cast art house 
and Malick-esque sublimity. The 
intrafamily conflict gets exposed 
by an anxious Ebba over drinks 
with a couple when hiding behind 
a faux smile, she says that Tomas 
“ran away from the table like a lit-
tle girl.” Her smile just sits there, 
eyes tired, while everyone else 
looks anywhere but toward her, 
as if they can’t even fathom her 
bewilderment. Then, not because 
we want to, the lens flashes to a 
broken Tomas. We almost feel bad 
for him. This scene owns an emo-
tional quotient unmatched by any 
movie this year, one that makes 
you respect Östlund as a talented 
filmmaker, as a human being.

“Force Majeure” is not devoid 

of flaw. Ebba’s divorced brother-
in-law and his 20-year-old girl-
friend at first provide an effective 
soundboard for Ebba’s troubles, 
but soon fizzle out, Östlund try-
ing to shoehorn an otherwise 
redundant device into an already 
compelling yarn. This soon grows 

irrelevant, getting lost in the oozy 
subtext of marital gender roles, 
male conniption fits, the politics 
of infidelity, the male gaze and 
the hidden imperfections of an 
aesthetically perfect family. And, 
like, other stuff, too. All of this 
framed like a hovering specter 
via Fredrik Wenzel’s cam adds a 
witty, self-aware mystique, invit-
ing us in without ever allowing us 
to feel at home.

And the acting. The parental 

performances, by these two no-
names, feel real in an unreal way, 
a way that our parents growing 
up would seldom reveal, but when 
they did, it felt cinematic. Östlund 
smothers us in pulchritude — the 
modelesque cast, the hotel ame-
nities, the perfectness — without 
abandoning the root: Nobody lives 
like a J.Crew catalog, all smiles 
and riches and no rub, not even 
the J-Crew mannequins. It’s a fine 
study on Top 0.01 Percent Prob-
lems, but even more, a nuanced 
mediation on familial psychology.

Acclaimed cartoonist 

headlines Penny 
Stamps lecture 

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

She came. She spoke. We 

laughed.

As soon as cartoonist and writ-

er Alison Bechdel appeared on 
stage at the Michigan Theater and 
graced the nearly-full crowd with 
her presence, she too laughed … at 
herself.

“There’s an old saying that car-

tooning is a field for people who 
are mediocre artists and medio-
cre writers, and I would say that 
in my case, those things are pretty 
much true,” Bechdel remarked. 
Soon after, Bechdel presented the 
audience with her rejection letter 
from the School of the Art Insti-
tute of Chicago.

It’s that genuine, self-deprecat-

ing humor and her idiosyncratic 
cartoons that captivated the audi-
ence on January 22.

But her accolades, such as her 

2014 MacArthur Genius Award 
and breakthroughs for the LGBT 
community, prove that she’s far 
from mediocre in her profession. 

Bechdel was selected to speak 

about her biographical graphic 
novels and the art of cartoon-
ing for part of the Penny Stamps 
Speaker Series, which has part-
nered with The Zell Visiting Writ-
er Series and The Institute for 
Research on Women & Gender. 
Speaker Series Director Chris-
stina Hamilton said Bechdel has 
been requested to speak numer-
ous times and is highly regarded 
by Stamps students.

Though ultimately delivered 

with insightful, witty candor, 
Bechdel’s presentation tugged at 
the audience’s heartstrings as she 
spoke about her unconventional 
upbringing, defined by the dra-
matic twists and turns within her 
family life. She evinced her signa-
ture ability to find humor in mis-
fortunes rather than succumb to 
them, proving her greatest talent 
lies beyond her work.

Bechdel’s graphic novels exam-

ine what most are shy to admit 
— let alone publish — such as the 
poignant tale of her father’s secre-
tive, sexual double life that led to 
his eventual suicide. Yet openness 
and freedom from inhibition is 
the essence of Bechdel’s powerful 
storytelling. 

Staying true to her childhood 

dreams, Bechdel made a name for 
herself and developed a unique 
style tinged with honesty. 

“I always wanted to be a car-

toonist, even when I was a little 
kid,” Bechdel said. “But it was 
soon pointed out to me that was 
not a very practical career choice.”

No stranger to grit and perse-

verance, Bechdel kept at her craft 
even when prospects were bleak.

“It took a lot of work and a lot 

of years before it actually became 
my job,” Bechdel said. “I had to 
keep pursuing it, keep pushing 
it, slowly let go of my paying day 
jobs. It was a long process com-
mitting to it.”

Bechdel emerged in the car-

tooning field with her marginal 
lesbian comic strip, “Dykes to 

Watch Out For,” (1983-2008), 
which originally was not intend-
ed for publishing. Instead, the 
comic was the medium through 
which Bechdel extracted humor 
from the lifestyles of her and her 
friends. 

“After I graduated from col-

lege, I had recently come out as 
a lesbian and I just started draw-
ing these comics for me and 
my friends about women like 
us, women who looked like us,” 
Bechdel said. “It was very unusu-
al in the early eighties to see any 
kind of different looking women 
in the media, you would just see 
very feminine women and we 
were all countering that kind of 
image and looking kind of wild, 
crazy and androgynous.”

Though well known for her 

comic strips and darkly humorous 
graphic novels, Bechdel is also the 
creator of her surname-titled test, 
which assesses the gender bias 
in films. The Bechdel test deems 
a film as feminist if it satisfies 
three requirements: one, if there 
is a scene with two women, two, 
the women have a conversation 
and three, if that dialogue is about 
something other than a man.

For fans of Bechdel and those 

who missed the presentation, a 
comprehensive showcase of her 
work will be on display at the 
Institute for Humanities through 
February 25. The exhibit features 
original diaries from Bechdel’s 
youth, the infamous rejection 
letters, notable comic strips and 
clutter from her creative process. 

Amanda Krugliak, arts cura-

tor for the Institute for Humani-
ties, modeled the exhibit after 
Bechdel’s childhood home with 
great attention to detail, even 
mimicking its wallpaper.

“Conceptually, the idea of the 

room is to place it in the context 
of the house she grew up in, which 
was this kind of Victorian house,” 
Krugliak said. “Her father was 
really interested in interiors and 
getting something just right from 
the Victorian period. I thought it 
would be interesting to use that as 
a starting point and think about 
all these things coexisting in this 
room — past, present, her work, 
but also bits and pieces of grow-
ing up.”

Bechdel also touched on the 

media’s response to the Jan. 7 ter-
rorist attack on Charlie Hebdo, a 
satirical French newspaper tar-
geted because of its depiction of 
the Prophet Muhammad.

“I think everybody can see the 

significance of cartoons and com-
ics especially right now,” Hamil-
ton said. “We’re sort of in a very 
fresh and precious moment with 
the terrorist acts that happened in 
Paris just in the last couple weeks 
that were directed specifically at 
cartoonists.”

Though intended for comedic 

effect, comics are undoubtedly a 
powerful tool. As evidenced by 
the recent, horrific Parisian trag-
edies, it’s clear that they can have 
formidable effects. Yet, the influ-
ence of the medium’s worldly suc-
cinctness is one to admire.

“Obviously the power of the 

cartoon is sometimes more pow-
erful than words can solve, that 
visual element can take it to 
another place,” Hamilton said. 
“The ability for comics and car-
toons to juxtapose real-world 
issues in a visual and separate 
world formant give people the 
ability to instantly see things that 
otherwise might take a novel to 
explain.”

Rather than acting in haste 

after the world deals us an unfa-
vorable card, perhaps we can move 
forward from adversity by taking 
a note from Bechdel and extract-
ing humor from our misfortunes 
rather than succumbing to them.

‘M’ hosts surging Nebraska

Wolverines 

continue to battle 
injuries coming off 
heartbreaking loss

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Fighting to stay afloat in the 

Big Ten standings, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team is gearing 
up for a team that’s just now 
hitting 
its 

stride.

Following 

an 
overtime 

loss to then-No. 
6 Wisconsin on 
Saturday, 
the 

Wolverines 
will try to avoid 
an 
untimely 

hangover when 
Nebraska visits 
Crisler Center 
on Tuesday.

The 

Cornhuskers (4-3 Big Ten, 12-7 
overall) lost their first two games 
in conference play but have been 
much improved since, winning 
four of their last five and holding 
Illinois, Rutgers and Minnesota 
to under 50 points each. Against 
an 
injury-plagued 
Michigan 

team still looking for consistency 
on offense, their stingy defense 
could pose a significant threat.

“(Nebraska is) maybe the best 

defensive team in the league 
right now, if you look at their 
numbers,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “They’re staggering 
with what they’ve done with 
their field-goal percentage both 
at the 3-point line and defensive 
field-goal percentage.”

Beilein said Monday that the 

Wolverines (5-3, 12-8) could once 
again be looking at a change to 
the starting lineup as a result of 
injury, but did not specify which 

players are ailing this week.

The player Michigan can 

least afford to lose, it seems, 
is sophomore guard Derrick 
Walton 
Jr., 
who 
led 
the 

team with 17 points against 
Wisconsin, including a game-
tying 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds 
left. He has been nursing a toe 
injury 
since 
late 
November 

and appeared to be limping in 
overtime Saturday.

If Walton can’t play, freshman 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman might need to step 
in. He has looked increasingly 
comfortable on the floor since 
the beginning of Big Ten play 
and could be a candidate to start. 
Abdur-Rahkman 
chipped 
in 

nine points against the Badgers 
and looked impressive on a pair 
of drives and finishes at the rim.

But picking the right bodies 

for the starting five is only half 
the battle. Even if the lineup 
stays in tact, the Wolverines are 
sure to be worn out after a long, 
physical game Saturday against 
the class of the conference.

“We put a lot of energy 

into that game,” Beilein said. 
“Coming back on two days rest is 
not as easy as you’d think. We’re 
a tired group right now, and 
we’re going to have to find a way 
to find energy right now.”

Looking 
to 
capitalize 
on 

Michigan’s 
exhaustion 
will 

be Nebraska forward Terran 
Petteway, who scored 32 points 
in Nebraska’s 79-77 win over 
Michigan State on Saturday.

Petteway was named to the 

Preseason All-Big Ten team 
after a breakout season in 2013-
14, during which he averaged 
18.1 points and 4.8 rebounds. 
This season, he has upped 
those numbers to 19.6 and 
5.1, respectively. The 6-foot-6 
swingman poses a mismatch 
problem 
for 
Michigan, 
but 

keeping him in check will be key 
to the Wolverines game plan.

“You have to pay a lot of 

attention to him,” Beilein said. 
“No matter what defense you’re 
in, you better mark him well 
when he doesn’t have the ball. 

When he gets the ball, he should 
see 10 eyes looking at him. … He 
can just get baskets where you’re 
gonna shake your head and say, 
‘How did that go in?’ ”

But 
while 
Petteway 
will 

attract all the attention when 
the Cornhuskers have the ball, 
Michigan will try to spread its 
scoring around the floor.

Sophomore 
forward 
Zak 

Irvin continues to work through 
a shooting funk, but he leads 
all active Wolverines with 13.6 
points per game. And while the 
emphasis on Irvin’s struggles has 
fallen on his 3-pointers, Irvin has 
actually shot a higher percentage 
from beyond the arc (34.1) than 
he has on 2-pointers (32.8) since 
conference play began.

But as will be the case for the 

rest of the season, Michigan 
will take any kind of scoring 
wherever it can get it.

“This is one of those years 

where I don’t think we’ve ever 
had the rotation figured out,” 
Beilein said. “Hopefully we’ll get 
to that point.”

Behind Enemy Lines: 
Nebraska’s Tim Miles

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Writer

Nebraska coach Tim Miles 

and his Cornhuskers were get-
ting a little more attention before 
this 
sea-

son start-
ed 
than 

they 
had 

received 
the previ-
ous year.

Nebraska was picked by the 

media to finish fourth in the Big 
Ten at the beginning of the sea-
son. The year before, the Corn-
huskers were picked 12th out of 
12 teams in the 
preseason con-
ference predic-
tions.

The 
press 

had 
taken 

notice, 
and 

after 
mak-

ing the NCAA 
Tournament 
last year, Miles’ 
table at Big Ten 
Media Day in October was a little 
more crowded than in past years. 
His newly acquired popularity 
prevented the Daily from ques-
tioning the coach about how he 
plans on covering Michigan’s big 
men and his thoughts on wheth-
er junior Terran Petteway will 
come back for his senior season 
or declare for the NBA Draft, but 
we still fired off some questions 
regarding the more serious issue 
at hand: How does Miles always 
give the best press conference?

It was true at his 2013 Big Ten 

Media presser when he light-
heartedly discussed his wife 
giving him a hard time for not 
recruiting enough and made self-
deprecating 
comments 
about 

being picked to finish last. It was 
true at his postgame interview 

after losing at Michigan in Feb-
ruary, when he muted himself 
in place of using a curse word 
and referenced Seinfeld. And it 
was true at Big Ten Media Day 
in October when he suggested a 
happy hour for the media.

Miles had to run from Media 

Day early to catch a flight back 
to Lincoln to make an afternoon 
practice, but that didn’t stop us 
from learning the art of a good 
press conference from the guy 
who practically invented it.

The Michigan Daily: Who 

gives your favorite press confer-
ence?

Tim Miles: I don’t watch any; 

I should prob-
ably. I’d prob-
ably get some 
good tips on 
how to act.

TMD: After 

last year’s per-
formance 
at 

Big Ten Media 
Day, did you 
prep at all for 
today?

TM: Nope.
TMD: Honest?
TM: I don’t prep.
Nebraska Sports Informa-

tion Director: He didn’t prep. 
He has actual Big Ten knowledge.

TMD: What’s the best ques-

tion you’ve ever been asked?

TM: Yours. That one right 

there.

TMD: If you could ask any 

basketball personality a question, 
who would you pick and what 
would you ask them?

TM: I would ask Bo Ryan how 

he does it. I think he is an unbe-
lievable coach. (The Big Ten) has 
all of them. But Bo, being a guy 
that’s gone from a small college 
like me, and being so successful 
in the Big Ten, (getting) inside 
into his world would be great.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

BEHIND
ENEMY

Defense still ranks 
near nation’s worst

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

The No. 13 Michigan hockey 

team’s offense is the reason 
this team has earned its highest 
ranking since 
the 
home 

opener Oct. 18.

The offense is the reason the 

Wolverines overcame a four-
goal deficit Friday, en route to 
its second straight series sweep. 
In doing so, it proved the recent 
scoring 
outburst 
— 
which 

culminated in a 10-goal rout of 
Ohio State — was more than just 
a hot streak.

It leads the nation in scoring 

with a commanding average of 
4.36 goals per game.

But Michigan coach Red 

Berenson won’t soon forget a 
coach’s favorite mantra: defense 
wins championships.

“It’s the defensive part I’m 

concerned 
about,” 
he 
said 

Monday.

Prior to the series opener, 

the Badgers had scored just two 
first-period goals in 18 contests 
this season. In the first period 
Friday, they scored three.

In stark contrast to the 

offense, Michigan carries the 
No. 44 defense in the nation. 
It allows three goals per game 
and kills penalties at a rate 
under 80 percent. And given the 
inconsistency in net — junior 
goaltender Steve Racine lasted 
only one period in his only 
start against Wisconsin — that 
number has the potential to go 
up.

Michigan’s 
recent 
streak 

hasn’t seen tight games, but the 
numbers suggest this offense 
can’t afford to have an off night.

An 
NCAA 
Tournament 

appearance hinges on it.

ONE-GAME WEEKENDS: 

It will more be than one month 
until the Wolverines play on a 
Saturday.

In the middle of a seven-

week stretch away from Yost Ice 
Arena, Michigan will have two 
straight one-game weekends 

to close out the first half of 
conference play. The Wolverines 
will take on Michigan State in 
the “Duel in the ‘D’” on Friday 
before the in-state rivals travel 
to Chicago to face off in the 
Hockey City Classic at Soldier 
Field.

Given 
their 
recent 

dominance, 
the 
Wolverines 

would like a chance to win 
every night in order to maintain 
their position to make the 
NCAA Tournament, especially 
with the weakness of the Big 
Ten.

“We’d like to play more,” 

Berenson said. “The Big Ten 
sets the schedule, so we’re at 
their mercy.”

The Wolverines will return to 

a two-game weekend schedule 
in a rematch with Minnesota in 
Minneapolis on Feb. 27.

STARTLING STATS: After 

Saturday’s 6-0 blowout win, 
Berenson compared his current 
team to the 1997-98 national 
championship squad. And he 
had good reason to do so, given 
the tear this offense has been on 
of late.

For 
starters, 
after 

relinquishing an early lead, 
the 
Wolverines 
scored 
12 

unanswered 
goals 
in 
four 

periods, stifling any and every 
Badgers offensive rush in the 
neutral zone.

Michigan’s 
seven-game 

winning streak is now its longest 
since March 2011, back when 
the Wolverines made the NCAA 
Tournament year after year. In 
addition to leading the nation in 
scoring, the Wolverines record 
the third-highest average of 
shots per game (35.14).

The Wolverines have also 

had the luxury of beating up on 
a noticeably weak Big Ten.

After 
dropping 
its 
first 

conference 
matchup 
against 

Penn State at home, Michigan 
went 7-0 against its next three 
opponents — including then-No. 
12 Minnesota and Ohio State — 
scoring 52 times for a stunning 
average of 6.5 goals per game.

Weekend sweep proves depth

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

On more than one occasion 

Saturday night, Alex Talcott’s 
shot rang off the goalpost, inches 
from his first career goal.

Prior 
to 
the 
game, 
the 

freshman forward hadn’t played 
in a game since Nov. 1.

Of course, Michigan didn’t 

need the tally. The 13th-ranked 
Wolverines 
had 
already 

established a commanding five-
goal lead over Wisconsin, and 
soon finished off a sweep on the 
road having scored 13 goals.

But scoring chances from 

Talcott 
and 
several 
other 

forwards showed that an offense 
that averages more than 4.36 
goals is as deep as it is top-heavy.

“We’re pretty well-balanced,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “It seems like when 
we need a goal, we’ll get it from 
one of our top nine.

“We’ve had different players 

step up on our lines.”

In 
fact, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

success in Madison came despite 
noteworthy absences from the 
lineup.

Senior forward Travis Lynch 

— the fourth-line center and 
key feature of the penalty kill 
— did not make the trip after 
undergoing wrist surgery last 
week. Sophomore Evan Allen, 
who has seen playing time on 
the line this season, was also out 
with a concussion.

Senior 
defenseman 
Mike 

Chiasson also stayed in Ann 
Arbor with a concussion.

In 
Lynch’s 
place, 
junior 

forward Boo Nieves was set to 
anchor the fourth line before 
getting sick and missing out both 
games. His absence forced the 
Wolverines to roll three lines 
out, more or less, each night, 
putting added pressure on the 
offense.

“It’s been a work in progress,” 

Berenson said. “Boo has shown 
some spurts of his potential. … I 
think he’s starting to come into 
his own.”

Without those players, senior 

forward Zach Hyman continued 
to put on a clinic around the net, 
while fellow scoring leaders 
Dylan Larkin, Alex Kile and 
Andrew Copp all contributed big 
weekends.

But the offensive production 

wasn’t limited to the top five 
forwards.

Junior 
forward 
Justin 

Selman, for example, tied his 
career high of five goals in a 
season Friday by virtue of his 
first career hat trick. Selman 
missed several weeks in October 
with a broken wrist and has 
shown significant improvement 
since. He and Nieves both have 
double-digit 
points 
totals, 

which was not the case in the 
two seasons prior.

“He’s a different player now,” 

Berenson said. “This is the best 
hockey I’ve seen Justin Selman 
play since he came to school.”

Scoring isn’t just limited to 

the forwards, either.

Michigan’s final goal of the 

weekend came from freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski. 

With two goals on Saturday, 
Werenski now has 18 points on 
the year — second among Big 
Ten freshmen behind Larkin.

He is one of four blue-liners 

with more than nine points this 
season.

As a unit, the defense has 

tallied 67 points, accounting for 
a quarter of Michigan’s offense 
this season.

This offense is so deep that 

reigning Big Ten Freshman of 
the Year JT Compher — who led 
the team in scoring last season 
— ranks No. 9 on the team in 
scoring. He’s not struggling, but 
on a team whose goal-scoring 
leader sits among the top five in 
the nation in scoring, Compher’s 
mediocre four goals don’t tell the 
whole story.

“I feel like whoever is on the 

ice has a chance of scoring,” 
Berenson said.

The offense is so deep that 

when Talcott’s shot rings off the 
crossbar, it’s more likely than not 
that a Wolverine will be there to 
redirect it in.

Michigan extends 
home win streak

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team entered Crisler 
Center on Monday night having 
won five straight home games, 
including its first three against 
Big 
Ten 

opponents.

For 
a 

struggling 
Illinois squad to have any chance 
of securing a streak-snapping 
upset, it needed to both outshoot 
the Wolverines and contain 
senior forward Cyesha Goree.

The Fighting Illini (2-6 Big 

Ten, 11-9 overall) weren’t able to 
do either.

Michigan (5-3, 13-6) jumped 

out to a quick lead by making 
nine of its first 12 field goals. 
Goree also picked up her now-
customary double-double (19 
points, 14 rebounds), allowing 
the Wolverines drop Illinois 
handedly, 70-57.

The Illinois post players gave 

it their best effort, but they 
simply had no answer for Goree 
on either side of the ball.

On 
offense, 
senior 
guard 

Shannon Smith and Michigan’s 
other passers frequently pushed 
the tempo in transition, looking 
for Goree in the paint early and 
often. Even on transition plays 
when she was triple-covered, 
the Wolverines had little trouble 
forcing passes into the paint 
for Goree, who scored eight of 
Michigan’s first ten points.

“We really did a great job of 

sharing the basketball, having 
a ton of assists and finding 
Cyesha,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “We found 
her a ton early, and then we kind 
of got greedy.”

On the other end, Goree’s 

tough post defense left very 
few offensive opportunities for 
the Fighting Illini. Matched up 
against two different 6-foot-3 
forwards, Goree still managed to 
pick up three blocks and help her 
team win the rebounding battle, 
41-28.

While Goree’s presence down 

low was invaluable, Michigan 
truly separated itself with its 
long-range 
game. 
Facing 
a 

significant height disadvantage 
and a tough zone defense, the 
Wolverines 
were 
forced 
to 

look for open shots around the 
perimeter, and they delivered.

Sophomore 
guard 
Siera 

Thompson, 
whose 
shooting 

percentage 
has 
fluctuated 

throughout 
the 
season, 

made four of 
her eight shots, 
including two 
3-pointers and 
a 
long-range 

2-pointer. 
Freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty, 
whose 3-point 
shooting prowess is a key in 
most opposing scouting reports, 
found 
numerous 
wide-open 

shots from beyond the arc and 
knocked down five of them.

“My 
team 
creates 
(those 

shots) for me,” Flaherty said. 
“They find me in great positions. 
As you can see, a lot of my shots 
I really don’t have to put the ball 
on the floor for. They look over 
the top of the zone, or the guards 
attack into the middle of the 
zone and see me spotting up, so 
it creates shots that are easy for 
me to hit.”

Conversely, 
the 
Fighting 

Illini struggled mightily when 

Michigan’s defense forced them 
to the outside. Illinois shot 
just 21 percent (4-for-19) from 
beyond the arc, with three shots 
missing the rim by several feet. 
Even on one memorable first-
half play where both Thompson 
and 
senior 
forward 
Nicole 

Elmblad tripped and fell to the 
ground in a heap, the Fighting 
Illini failed to convert an 
uncontested triple.

But Illinois still managed to 

stay within 10-15 points of the 
Wolverines for much of the game 
because of a several mistakes 
in transition. Michigan lost 25 
turnovers, 
including 
several 

errant passes in the first half that 
sailed out of bounds.

“(Illinois) 

played kind of 
crazy, 
which 

forced 
us 

to 
turn 
the 

ball 
over,” 

Flaherty said. 
“We 
need 

to 
be 
more 

patient, more 
confident 
at 

times.”

But thanks 

largely to a sharp improvement 
from Smith, who scored all 13 of 
her points in the second half, the 
Wolverines finished strong to 
seal a 13-point win.

“You can make a couple bad 

plays in a game, or you can have 
a bad half, or you can have a bad 
39 minutes, and maybe make 
one play to help your team win 
the game,” Barnes Arico said. 
“But if you let all that stuff 
bother you, mentally, you’re 
not in a good place to make that 
play.

“(Smith) is good enough to 

make a play that’s going to be a 
difference maker for us.”

more patient, 
more confident 

at times.”

Inside-out game leads 
Michigan to victory

Post presence opens 

perimeter for hot 
3-point shooting 

night at home

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

Cyesha 
Goree 
had 
three 

players 
hovering 
over 
her, 

and with barely any room to 
maneuver, she made a layup 
anyway.

Monday 
night 
at 
Crisler 

Center, 
the 
senior 
forward 

faced multiple triple teams, but 
she nonetheless managed to 
fight through most of them. In 
every other instance, she was 
double-teamed, and that was 
even easier.

When it wasn’t Goree, it was 

senior forward Nicole Elmblad, 
who in the opening minutes 
salvaged a missed triple by 
senior guard Shannon Smith to 
set up the offense for another 
basket.

And 
when 
the 
Fighting 

Illini 
prevented 
the 
duo 

from wreaking havoc down 
low, sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson, 
freshman 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty and junior 
guard 
Madison 
Ristovski 

cleaned up nicely from the 
3-point line.

With a strong and physical 

game in the paint that opened 
up the floor for other shooters to 
step in, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team easily pulled 
away with a 70-57 victory over 

Illinois.

“It makes it hard for teams 

to defend you,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “When 
we go through preparing for 
opponents, we try to say, ‘What 
can we take away?’ … If you have 
people like Cyesha inside and 
people that can shoot it from the 
outside, then who’s gonna help? 
I think that really opens up the 
game for us.”

Though the Fighting Illini 

scored 10 more points in the 
paint than Michigan, it was 
the Wolverines who dominated 
on the glass, outrebounding 
Illinois, 41-28. The game came 
down to defensive rebounding, 
where Goree and Elmblad — 
who collected 
14 and 12 total 
rebounds, 
respectively 
— 
led 
the 

charge.

With 

7:52 
left 
in 

the 
second 

half, 
Illinois 

was 
looking 

to 
make 
a 

comeback when center Chatrice 
White drove inside the paint. 
Goree and Elmblad covered the 
Illini’s leading scorer almost 
instantly, forcing a lane violation.

Meanwhile, 
on 
offense, 

Michigan continued to find 
Goree under the basket in 
transition, allowing her to pick 
up quick baskets.

When Illinois began to pack 

the paint to stop the inside 
threat, Goree started to find 
herself trapped on the baseline. 

The outside game willed the 
Wolverines to victory.

Finding 
themselves 
open 

on the outside, Flaherty (five), 
Thompson (two) and Ristovski 
(one) 
played 
a 
threatening 

3-point shooting game, going a 
combined 8-for-18.

As for Flaherty, she was 

always open.

“We’re great when we go 

inside and back out,” Flaherty 
said. “It opens up the floor a 
lot, especially when (Cyesha) 
is down inside because she can 
make shots and is a good passer. 
… She knows how to get me in 
good positions to score.”

Added Goree: “If I’m doubling 

in the paint, then I know I have 

Katelynn 
outside 
for 

sure. 
I’m 

confident 
she’s going to 
make nine out 
of 10 of those 
shots. … (You 
gotta) 
know 

(defenders 
are) 
gonna 

collapse 
and 

you gotta get it out quick.”

Both Barnes Arico and Goree 

refer to their team as a selfless 
one, always willing to share 
the basketball. That’s why four 
Michigan players scored in 
double digits, and it’s why the 
Wolverines set a goal to average 
20-plus assists a game.

Against the Illini, it worked 

in Michigan’s favor, and if the 
Wolverines can keep things 
consistent, it will continue to 
work in the games to come.

“I’m confident 
she’s going to 

make nine out of 
10 of those shots.”
