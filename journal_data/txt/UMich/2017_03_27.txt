In 
celebration 
of 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

bicentennial, 
the 
2017 

graduating class will be sent 
off in style with a graduation 
ceremony at Michigan Stadium 
featuring 
University 
figures 

from the past and present, 
musical 
performances 
and 

alumni award presentations. 

The ceremony will be on 

April 29 and will break a long-
standing tradition of seating 
the graduates on the stands and 
instead, seat them on the field, 
so more tickets can be given 
to families and friends of the 
graduates.

In a University press release, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said the event will 
contribute to the year-long 
bicentennial 
festivities 
and 

will highlight the extensive 
history of graduates from the 
University.

“Our 
bicentennial 

commencement 
gives 
our 

community 
the 
opportunity 

to honor the graduates of the 
Class of 2017, along with the 
amazing 200-year-old legacy of 
excellence and impact that they 
are joining,” Schlissel said. 

The 
opening 
bicentennial 

fanfare, 
written 
by 
Music, 

Theatre & Dance Prof. Roshanne 
Etezady, will be followed by Vice 
Admiral Walter E. Carter Jr., 

A variety of panelists from 

Chinese businesses, government 
and media who aimed to share 
their insights on the future of 
economic relations between the 
United States and China spoke at 
the 2017 Michigan China Forum, 
which was held at the Ross School 
of Business over the weekend as 
part of the bicentennial of the 
University of Michigan.

The event, which more than 500 

people attended, was organized by 
the Chinese Students & Scholars 
Association, 
the 
University’s 

chapter of China Entrepreneur 
Network and the University of 
Michigan-Shanghai 
Jiao 
Tong 

University Joint Institute.

Engineering senior Ziqi Guo, 

president of the SJTU Student 
and Alumni Association and one 
of the organizers of the forum, 
said he wanted to build a stronger 
relationship between China and 
the University by inviting leading 
thinkers.

“(An) area that we really 

emphasize 
is 
the 
younger 

generation,” Guo said. “We really 
want to make this a platform for 
students from China, the U.S. and 
all countries to come together and 
learn with each other and hope to 
understand each other better.”

Sunday, the second day of the 

event, opened with a keynote 
address by Hong Lei, the Chinese 
Consul General in Chicago, who 
addressed the need to forge a 
new and stronger Sino-American 

relationship by overcoming the 
two countries’ differences and 
identifying shared interests.

“China’s greatest desire is to 

focus our development of our 
own, and improve and ensure 
people’s livelihoods,” Hong said. 
“To achieve this goal, China needs 
to stay in harmony with the rest of 
the world, including the U.S., and 
achieve win-win results through 
cooperation.”

Hong was joined by Brian 

Connors, executive director of 
the Michigan-China Innovation 
Center, 
who 
chronicled 
the 

enormous strides the state of 
Michigan has made in developing 
strong economic ties with China, 
especially in the automotive sector.

“I hope the Consul-General 

would agree that … Michigan is 
among the most welcoming and 
the most friendly and certainly 
the most active in this region 
among the Midwestern states in 

attracting 
Chinese 
investment 

and building relationships with 
China,” Connors said.

The keynote was followed 

by a series of panels discussing 
topics like U.S.-China relations, 
development 
of 
new 
media, 

entrepreneurship and autonomous 
vehicle technology.

One of the issues widely 

discussed among the panelists 
was bilateral relations under the 

LSA junior Anushka Sarkar and 

Public Policy junior Nadine Jawad 
will serve as the 2017-18 Central 
Student 
Government 
president 

and vice president, respectively, 
according 
to 
election 
results 

released early Saturday morning.

Sarkar and Jawad ran with the 

eMerge party, and defeated the 
second-place 
Movement 
Party 

executive candidates Evan Rosen 
and Dan Sweeney, LSA juniors, by 
a margin of 4,179 votes — or more 
than three times Movement’s 1,677 
votes. Art & Design senior Keysha 
Wall and LSA senior Lauren Kay 
of the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party came in third with 243 votes, 
and Better Than the Rest finished 
fourth with 157 votes. Student 
turnout measured at 17.9 percent, 
marking the lowest participation 
rate since 2014.

As no complaints were filed 

with 
the 
University 
Election 

Commission, Saturday’s results 
were deemed official.

The protest came in light of President Donald Trump’s travel ban on Muslim countries

Hundreds 
of 
protesters 

braved the rain on Saturday 
to gather outside the Federal 
Building in Ann Arbor and 
march for immigrants’ rights 
in light of President Donald 

Trump’s 
latest 
travel 
ban, 

which was blocked by federal 
judges in Hawaii and Maryland 
last week. 

The 
mission 
of 
the 

Immigrants’ 
March 
in 

Ann Arbor — organized by 
independent Ann Arbor resident 
Brad Adam and a direct-action 
organization 
called 
Stop 

Trump Ann Arbor— included 
promoting the message shared 
on the event page: “No human 
being is illegal.” The march also 
aimed to remove Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement 

from 
nearby 
communities 

and 
challenge 
the 
Trump 

administration’s 
immigration 

policies, and was a sister march 

for a similar one being held in 
Washington, D.C. in the near 
future.

March volunteer Alexandria 

Schulz, a University of Michigan 
alum, joined the efforts partly 
because of her own cultural 
background. Schulz’s father is 
an immigrant from Trinidad

Last week, as U.S. Senate 

confirmation hearings ended for 
Judge Neil Gorsuch, students 
on both ends of the University 
of Michigan’s campus political 
spectrum expressed degrees of 
satisfaction, but also disapproval 
of President Donald Trump’s U.S. 
Supreme Court nominee.

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

said in an interview on the LSA 
website he predicts Gorsuch 
would be the second most-
conservative member of the 
court, according to a model 
he helped develop with Kevin 
Quinn from the University of 
California at Berkeley’s School of 
Law to measure the ideologies of 
Supreme Court justices.

“Our models suggest that 

he will be the second most-
conservative 
justice 
on 
the 

court, in between Samuel Alito 
and Clarence Thomas, which is 
exactly the same position that 
Scalia took on the court,” Martin 
said.

As 
“I 
Got 
a 
Feeling” 

reverberated 
throughout 
the 

Indoor Track Building Saturday 
afternoon, hundreds of students 
and families prepared to stand 
for 24 hours to raise money for 
local children with disabilities 

and illnesses.

VictorThon 
2017, 
the 

capstone 
event 
of 
Dance 

Marathon at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
serves 
to 

bring students and campus 
organizations 
together 

to 
raise 
awareness 
about 

pediatric rehabilitation, and 
monetary funds for both C.S. 
Mott Children’s Hospital and 
Beaumont Children’s Hospital. 

DMUM is the largest student-
run, 
nonprofit 
organization 

on campus and in the state of 
Michigan. 

LSA senior Allison Sheehan, 

DMUM 
executive 
director, 

kicked 
off 
the 
event 
by 

emphasizing the importance 
of DMUM’s history, and how 
much money has been raised 
since 
the 
organization’s 

inception.

“Throughout 
DMUM’s 

20-year 
history, 
this 

organization has raised over 
$5 million for the kids,” she 
said. “To break this down a 
little further, over the past 20 
years, over 15,000 college-age 
students have stood on their 
feet for over 528 hours to show 
the kids and the families that 
we will never stop supporting 
them. But what does this all 
really mean? The true magic 
of DMUM is that it has the 
ability to impact so many 
people in so many different 
ways.”

LSA junior Sam Boeve, 

director of DMUM family 
relations, said he became 
involved with DMUM after 
attending 
VictorThon 
his 

freshman year and realizing 
he wanted to be a part of the 
organization’s culture and 
mission.

“I 
became 
involved 
in 

DMUM as a freshman through 
my fraternity,” he said. “A 
couple older guys in Phi Delt 
were involved in leadership 
and really stressed DMUM’s 
amazing cause and mission. 
The first event I attended was 
VictorThon, and when I was 
there, totally immersed in the 
culture, I knew I wanted to get 
more involved the next year.”

Boeve added that DMUM 

is a very diverse group of 
students, and events such 
as VictorThon bring people 
together from across campus.

There are many reasons why 

Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh is famous. His coaching 

skills, his own football career, his 

“enthusiasm unknown to mankind.” 

And of course, his iconic khakis.

So it was no surprise that 

Harbaugh made headlines this 

weekend for admitting he’d switched 

from his usual $8 khakis to a new pair 

of $128 Lululemon pants.

ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington 

broke the news to fans via Twitter 

on Friday. According to Darlington, 

Harbaugh has fully committed to his 

new fashion.

“I’ll never wear anything else,” 

Harbaugh told ESPN.

Though he didn’t speak publicly 

about the switch until this weekend, 

an investigation from the Washington 

Post found evidence that Harbaugh 

has been wearing Lululemon since 

the latter half of this year’s season. 

Some perceptive fans became 

suspicious of the change as early as 

this past November.

“Is it just me or has Jim 

Harbaugh made the upgrade to 

LuluLemon ABC Pants …?” one fan 

tweeted.

Indeed, television reporter 

Brad Galli gave Harbaugh his first 

pair as a gift during an interview 

in September. Harbaugh told GQ 

Magazine in an interview earlier last 

week, before he announced the new 

pants were from Lululemon, that he 

wears them for everything, and he 

loves their versatility.

“I can work out in my khakis,” 

Harbaugh said. “And do … They 

make me feel good, too. Like I have 

a uniform. I always liked having a 

uniform.”

The new pants are noticeably 

different from his old khakis. Though 

the color seems to be the same, 

Harbaugh has traded out pleats and 

loose ankles for a tighter fit and a 

reflective inseam that can be seen 

when the pant legs are rolled up.

Many fans — and even former 

players — have been receptive to the 

change, saying he looks great.

However, some people have 

been critical. Evan Jankens of CBS 

Detroit thinks the switch is unfair to 

Nike, who designed special khakis 

for Harbaugh at the beginning of last 

season.

“If you ask me, it’s kind of a slap 

in the face to Nike who made special 

khakis for the coach, but who am I to 

judge?” Jankens wrote.

Nike hasn’t commented on 

the switch. However, Karl Aaker, 

Lululemon’s men’s brand director, 

confirmed to the Washington 

Post that the company is thrilled 

Harbaugh likes its pants — though the 

coach isn’t an official spokesperson.

“We’re pumped,” Aaker said.

Harbaugh’s Khakis— an 

unofficial fan account on Twitter 

meant to celebrate his iconic pants— 

also has yet to comment on the 

change.

and Tobago, and she believes 
immigration is a topic that 
affects all Americans.

“Unless 
you’re 
Native 

American, you’re an immigrant 
or a descendant of immigrants,” 
she said.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Mich.) was in attendance and 
thanked the spirited marchers 
for uniting to fight for the 
rights of all Americans, urging 
them to not be divided by hate 
and fear.

“We’re in the rain and cold 

because 
we’re 
protecting 

the 
constitution,” 
Dingell 

exclaimed 
to 
the 
cheering 

crowd.

Dingell promised to advocate 

for immigrant rights when she 
returned to Washington, D.C.

LSA freshman Lin Wang came 

to lend his support because he 
felt it was important for him to 
stand up for immigrant rights.

“I’m the son of immigrants 

so I feel like we should stand 
and 
support 
them,” 
Wang 

said. “With everything that’s 
going on in politics, it’s not 
representative of what America 
stands for.”

The 
crowd 
consisted 
of 

UM students, professors, Ann 
Arbor residents and students 
from as far as Albion. Among 
them was six-year-old Allegra 

Graf, daughter of Art & Design 
professor Roland Graf. Her 
father is of Austrian heritage, 
and her mother, who is from 
Brazil, gave birth to Allegra in 
Vienna. Andréia Graf explained 
she brought Allegra and her 
other daughter, Vida, who is 
three years old, to the march 
to help the girls understand the 
issues the country is facing.

When asked why she joined 

the march, Allegra — holding up 
a homemade sign that read “Not 
nice Mr. Trump” — said, “Because 
Donald Trump is not letting all 
the people from different lands 
live here.”

Bystanders stopped to watch 

the 
procession 
march 
down 

Liberty Street before turning 
onto State Street to get to the 
Diag, some even joining in with 
the protesters’ chants: “No hate, 
no fear, immigrants are welcome 
here” and “No cooperation with 
Trump’s deportation.”

Before and after the march, 

speakers shared their stories with 
the marchers. Volunteers from 
Stop Trump Ann Arbor spoke 
as well, discussing their efforts 
to help victims of detentions 
and deportation. Art & Design 
senior Keysha Wall spoke on 
the importance of action in the 
current political climate.

“We’ve won the freedom for 

Yousef, who’s a father of four 
in Ann Arbor who was being 
held in Kalamazoo,” they said. 
“We’re also working to get bond 

for another Ann Arbor resident. 
We are saying no cooperation 
with ICE whatsoever. Ann Arbor 
needs to become a sanctuary city 
and U of M needs to become a 
sanctuary campus.”

Signs 
that 
read 
“families 

have no borders” and “without 
immigrants, 
Trump 
couldn’t 

have as many wives” were on 
display, including one that read, 
“immigrants 
make 
America 

great” held by a man wearing 
a 
black-and-white 
prisoner 

jumpsuit and sporting a papier-
mâché mask of Trump’s head 
with a grumpy expression.

Other students, however, have 

met Trump’s ban with mixed 
reactions. Engineering freshman 
Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair 
of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
told the Daily in a January 
interview that while many people 
have labeled the order a ban on 
Muslims, the title ignores many 
Muslim countries that were not 
affected.

“To 
be 
clear, 
President 

Trump’s 
immigration 
order 

is not a ‘Muslim ban,’ nor is it 
a ban on anyone or anything,” 
Merrill said. “If the people 
calling this order a ‘Muslim 
ban’ were correct, that would 
imply that immigration from 
around 
50 
Muslim-majority 

countries would be terminated 
and that a religious test would 
be implemented to enter the 
country.”

The

history 

consists of a number of famous 
speeches and moments that 
occurred before images could 
be captured on high-quality 
film. Music, Theatre & Dance 
Prof. Malcolm Tulip said his

current 
University

reading the words of past 
speeches. He said the project 
will 
highlight 
the 
current 

graduates and the 200 years of 
academia before them. 

“For years now, we have 

become used to seeing great 
speeches and events on video,” 
Tulip said in the press release. 

“In the early days of the 
university this documentation 
did not exist or was lost. This 
project 
assembles 
a 
series 

of excerpts from significant 
speeches from the university’s 
past. 
In 
seven 
minutes, 

graduating students and their 
families will gain a sense of 
their place in the university and 
nation’s history.”

Though there is a large 

emphasis on the bicentennial 
and 
the 
University’s 
past, 

Interim Provost Paul Courant 
said in the release the ceremony 
will not lose sight of its main 
focus: the current graduates.

“Graduation, as always, is 

principally about the academic 
achievements of the students 
who are graduating,” Courant 
said. “We are pleased and 
proud to honor them and their 
achievements.”

In lieu of the typical honorary 

degrees 
presentation 
at 

commencement, the University 
will present ten Bicentennial 
Alumni 
Awards. 
Schlissel 

said the awards showcase the 
positive impact past graduates 
have had in their fields and 
beyond.

“The alumni awards give 

us a very special opportunity 
to recognize individuals from 
our more recent past who can 
inspire our community through 
their 
outstanding 
ongoing 

work,” Schlissel said.

Two 
of 
the 
Bicentennial 

Alumni Award recipients, Music, 
Theatre & Dance graduates Benj 
Pasek and Justin Paul, were 
recently awarded “Best Original 
Song” Oscars for their work on 
the song “City of Stars,” featured 
in the movie “La La Land.” The 
songwriting duo will also stage 
a musical performance for the 
commencement 
ceremony, 

featuring Music, Theatre & 
Dance students. 

COMMENCEMENT

provoking 
central 
questions 

around identity and representation 
on campus, the party’s sweeping 
success is truly unprecedented. 
Sarkar and Jawad are the first 
female candidates elected on the 
same ticket in the last decade, and 
the first women of color voted into 
office since at least 1993.

eMerge’s campaign stood on 

three pillars of voice, opportunity 
and 
momentum, 
and 
Sarkar 

and Jawad often cited their 
positions in CSG and other 
student organizations to present 
a ticket backed by experience. 
Platform points were divided 
into more concrete “initiatives” 
— such as Wi-Fi on the Diag and 
a student mentorship program 
— and long-term “advocacy” 
issues such as improving testing 
accommodations 
and 
food 

insecurity 
support. 
The 
two 

also plan on lobbying for the 
reduction of the number of exams 
a student can take in one day 
from four to three, as well as the 

expansion of in-state tuition from 
undocumented undergraduates to 
include undocumented graduate 
and non-traditional students.

Upon recieving the official tally, 

Jawad said she was overcome with 
emotion.

“I cried,” she said. “I couldn’t 

believe the overwhelming victory, 
to see all of our (representatives) 
elected, to be the first women of 
color ever elected to this position, 
and 
just 
the 
overwhelming 

amount of support we got from 
the community. We just made 
history.” 

Both women agreed they would 

balance their short-term and long-
term goals rather than focus on one 
aspect of their platform in their 
first days in office—the assembly is 
expected to be seated on April 4—
but singled out a handful of issues: 
Sarkar named lobbying University 
Health Services to accept students’ 
Medicaid coverage as among 
her priorities, while Jawad said 
providing free phone and laptop 
chargers for student use will be an 
immediately achievable initiative. 

Movement’s candidates pitched 

greater student engagement in the 

student governing body, but much 
of the attention on the party was 
fueled by a controversial music 
video it released two weeks ago. 
The video, featuring a rap written 
and performed by Rosen, attracted 
more than 20,000 views. Many 
students found the video offensive: 
The only scene with female 
students appeared in a sexualized 
context, and Rosen — who is white 
— compared himself to Black 
inventor 
George 
Washington 

Carver. Though Rosen apologized 
and promised to take the video 
down, clips are still featured on 
the party’s Facebook page and 
continue to incite debate.

eMerge 
also 
filed 
two 

complaints 
to 
the 
University 

Elections Commission against the 
video for featuring what it alleged 
to be unauthorized endorsement 
by football coach Jim Harbaugh. 
Both complaints were eventually 
dropped.

Rosen congratulated eMerge on 

their victory, and said Movement’s 
supporters would “continue to 
have fun.”

administration of President Donald 
Trump. Trump has so far taken a 
hardline stance against China, by 
taking a jab at their currency policy, 
blaming the country for the loss of 
manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and 
breaking diplomatic precedent by 
calling the president of Taiwan, 
a region that Beijing considers a 
renegade province.

Gene Ma, chief China economist 

at 
Institute 
of 
International 

Finance, expressed concern about 
the upcoming meeting between 
Trump and Chinese President 
Xi Jinping in April, explaining 
Trump’s erratic behavior may 
confound the more reserved Xi.

“I’m very cautious that these 

two need to really try very hard to 
find common ground,” Ma said. “I 
don’t think President Xi Jinping 
will play golf … I’m afraid President 
Xi Jinping will talk based on a 
script through an interpreter, (but) 
President Trump will lose patience 
after five minutes.”

Engineering graduate student 

Xiran Bai said she found the 
interaction between Ma and the 
venture capitalists on the panel 
interesting because while Ma 
was pessimistic about U.S.-China 
relations, the venture capitalists’ 
outlooks were positive.

Bai said she sees truth in both 

sides of the argument, referring 
to Trump’s most recent executive 
order banning immigrants and 
refugees from six Muslim-majority 
countries.

“The (executive) order from 

President Trump, it can happen to 
us,” Bai said. “But from a business 
standpoint, everybody wants to 
make money, so that’s probably not 
going to be effective.”

When asked about anti-Chinese 

sentiment in the United States, 
Dwight Carlson, CEO of Coherix, 
an Ann Arbor-based 3-D machine 
vision company, said unions in 
Michigan were actually welcoming 
of Chinese companies investing in 
the state.

“Chinese 
companies 
are 

developing a very good relationship 
when they purchase (American) 

companies,” Carlson said. “The 
labor 
unions 
recognize 
that 

Chinese companies invest and 
therefore increase the number of 
jobs.”

Harry Man, a partner at Matrix 

Partners China, a private equity 
investment firm, addressed the 
concerns of Chinese “copycats” 
of American online services — for 
example, Baidu to Google and Sina 
Weibo to Twitter. Man said this 
is because everyone’s needs are 
relatively the same, and Chinese 
companies are starting to create 
innovative services of their own.

“A lot of people like to say that 

Chinese companies are copying 
what’s happening in the US, 
(but) it just so happens that in 
the initial 15 to 20 years of the 
development of internet space, 
creativity, the majority started 
from the U.S.,” Man said. “But in 
the last 2 to 3 years, we’ve been 
seeing a clear trend of more and 
more local creativity being done 
in China.”

said he likes Gorsuch and favors 
justices who closely adhere to 
the Constitution.

“We need to have more strict 

constructionism on the Supreme 
Court, especially to fill that gap 
that Scalia left,” Zalamea said. 
“It’s really essential to have 
somebody who is traditional in 
that sense, somebody who really 
sticks to what this country was 
founded on.”

Conversely, 
LSA 
junior 

Rowan Conybeare, chair of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said she believes 
strict constructionism restricts 
how the Constitution can be 
interpreted 
during 
changing 

times 
and 
with 
changing 

opinions.

“I think it’s very limiting,” 

Conybeare 
said. 
“Obviously, 

people’s opinions and times 
change and I think the more 
liberal justices interpret the 
Constitution differently with 
the changing opinion — I’m not 

trying to say we should change 
the Constitution, but just the 
interpretation.”

In 
a 
similar 
vein, 
LSA 

sophomore Brad McPherson, 
co-founder of Progressives at the 
University of Michigan, said he 
believes a strict interpretation 
of the Constitution inhibits 
advancement.

“To me ‘originalism’ sounds 

like ‘preventing progress,’ ” 
McPherson said. “Even when 
it passes the normal legislative 
means, (Gorsuch) uses the court 
basically to stop what he views 
as overreach, essentially — I 
think that’s wrong.”

Zalamea 
contested 

arguments such as these and 
said the document does not 
inhibit progress, but simply 
reinforces values and rights, 
like the Second Amendment, 
that he feels are invaluable 
to democracy in the United 
States.

“It’s 
absolutely 
not 
an 

impediment to progress at all 
to say that we need to stick 
strictly to the Constitution,” 
Zalamea said. “Our country 
was founded on great values, 

founded under God and the 
Bill of Rights, and that’s 
something we need to stick 
to.”

Another point of contention 

for liberals is the blockage 
of 
then-President 
Barack 

Obama’s 
nomination 
of 

Judge Merrick Garland by 
Senate 
Republicans 
last 

year following the death of 
conservative Justice Antonin 
Scalia. 

McPherson said he feels 

Republicans stole the court 
seat 
from 
Democrats 
and 

considers the appointment of 
Gorsuch illegitimate.

“To me, the entire choice of 

Neil Gorsuch is illegitimate, 
because the Republicans stole 
that Supreme Court seat,” 
McPherson said.

Conybeare agreed and said 

she believes it is not out of 
the norm for a president to 
nominate justices at the end 
of their terms, despite what 
Republicans claimed in order 
to justify their actions.

or many, today’s America 
is the pinnacle of the 
continuous development 

of 
humanity 
toward 
ever-

greater freedom. It represents 
the fruition of the cries of 
liberty at the gates of Bastille 
in France, the struggles of the 
abolitionists and the suffragists 
and the aspirations of the 
civil rights movements of the 
past century. Its values and 
principles are the culmination 
of the efforts of generations of 
social activists and freedom 
fighters. It is the vehemence of 
these ideals, the promises of 
liberty and equality, that draws 
thousands of immigrants here 
every year; it is the essence 
of these ideals that behooves 
Americans 
to 
accept 
these 

immigrants with open arms. As 
the beneficiaries of the progress 
achieved by the many sacrifices 
of the previous generations, we 
are obligated to preserve these 
hard-fought ideals. This entails 
the 
responsibility 
to 
study, 

understand and, if necessary, 
take action to protect the 
bedrocks of our civil society.

The intrinsic irony in the 

phrase “nation of immigrants” 
— 
first 
popularized 
by 

former President Kennedy — 
symbolizes 
human 
progress. 

Originating from Latin “natio,” 
which translates to “race” or 
“tribe,” the word “nation” has 
historically referred to people 
of the same origin. America, 
the nation of immigrants, is 
the tribe that is not tribal, the 
nation whose membership is 
not restricted to any particular 
nationality, a human effort to 
break away from the prejudices 
ingrained in us by our shared, 
but divisive, history. 

The American dream, the 

human dream, is the ideal 
that 
every 
human 
being, 

regardless 
of 
race, 
sex 
or 

religious background, should 
have an equal opportunity 
to 
achieve 
success 
and 

prosperity through hard work, 
determination and initiative. 
Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau 

famously wrote: “Man is born 
free, and everywhere he is in 
chains.” The American dream 
is an attempt at breaking the 
invisible chains of the human 
caste system, which deprives 
us of our birthright freedoms.

The sudden implementation 

of the executive order banning 
the entry of immigrants and 
foreign travelers into the United 
States based on their places of 
birth was a pushback against 
the vision of the American 
dream. On Jan. 27, a group of 
Iranian students and I gathered 
to watch the coverage of the 
president’s 
signing 
of 
the 

executive order. One of our 
close friends — a University of 
Michigan Art & Design alum — 
was on a flight back from Iran. 
She had traveled to Iran to take 
part in an art project in Tehran. 
As we anxiously awaited the 
news of her arrival, tales of the 
cruel implementation of the ban 
demoralized us. I listened in 
disbelief as I heard the ordeals 
of the Yale professor who did 
not know when he would be 
able to see his wife and newborn 
child and the story of the elderly, 
legally blind resident who was 
denied his medications at the 
airport while being detained. 
I could hardly hold back tears 
as I watched the five-year-
old boy who was handcuffed 
for hours in the airport being 
showered by his mother’s kisses 

after his release, his innocent 
eyes desperately searching for 
answers in his parents’ faces. 
Fortunately, our friend was 
allowed into the country with 
only minor issues at customs.

The events of the past few 

months have been a sobering 
reminder 
that 
our 
journey 

toward liberty and equality 
is not always a smooth and 
peaceful one. It reminded us 
of the horrific mistakes of the 
past. It reminded us of the 
MS St. Louis and its innocent 
passengers who were sent back 
to Europe from the shores of 
America, many ending up in 
Nazi concentration camps. It 
reminded us of the Japanese 
families who were sent to 
internment camps during World 
War II, who were ripped out of 
their daily lives for crimes they 
did not commit. It reminded us 
of the darkest chapters of the 
history of this nation.

This latest onslaught on the 

immigrant community is not 
only an attack on the lives and 
the dignities of the immigrant 
families, it is also an attack 
on our human dream. It is 
an attempt to reduce the role 
of the leadership of the free 
world to the chieftainship of a 
tribe. This is a challenge to the 
vision that led to the formation 
of this country, that America 
is “an asylum to the good, the 
persecuted, and to the the 
oppressed.” It is a test of the 
resolve of the American people 
in safeguarding their values. 
However, as an optimist, I 
believe that our journey toward 
liberty is unstoppable, that 
this is the last gasp of age-old 
prejudices struggling to survive 
the pace of human progress. I 
hope and believe that, despite 
these setbacks, you and I, along 
with the rest of humanity, 
will someday realize our great 
human dream.

The attack on our human dream

Farhad Shirani is a postdoctoral 

research fellow in Electrical and 

Computer Engineering at the University 

of Michigan.

S

tudents are, bar none, the 
most important resource at 
the University of Michigan. 

We are not simply students at the 
University; we are the University. 
Because of our importance, it 
is absolutely essential that we 
continuously elevate and ensure 
a diverse cross section of student 
voices 
in 
critical 
University 

decisions, especially those that 
impact the student experience.

The 
University’s 
highest 

governing body is the Board of 
Regents, which is comprised of 
eight members popularly chosen 
in a statewide election. The board, 
whose 
major 
responsibilities 

are to broadly provide “general 
supervision of (the) institution” and 
oversee the University’s budget, is 
distinct among many of its peers, 
because it does not guarantee 
student representation of any kind. 
Last year, during our campaign, and 
this year, during our administration, 
we tirelessly advocated for the 
inclusion of student voices on the 
Board of Regents — and more 
generally, for the integration of 
student 
representation 
at 
the 

University and city-wide levels.

Why is this important? As 

students, it naturally makes sense 
for us to have a seat at the table 
where decisions that impact 
the future of our University 
experience are made, from those 
about the Union renovation 
project to the yearly setting 
of 
the 
University’s 
budget 

and associated tuition rates. 
Additionally, including students 
would elevate the discussions by 
adding a much-needed diversity 
of backgrounds, viewpoints and 
experiences.

We are proud of the progress 

that 
our 
administration 
has 

made in its unending work to 
institutionalize 
student 
voice 

and 
participation 
throughout 

the University and Ann Arbor 
communities. In September, after 
the previous Central Student 
Government administration had 
laid an indispensable foundation, 
we successfully pushed through 
a new section to the board’s 
Bylaws, 7.01, which highlights 
the 
importance 
of 
“student 

participation 
in 
University 

decision-making” and guarantees 
that it will be “sought and 
encouraged.” This can and should 
be viewed as an incremental 
positive step in the long-term 
goal to establish greater student 
representation on the Board of 
Regents — a goal that all future 
CSG administrations must strive 
and work toward. 

Another 
critical 
avenue 
of 

University decision-making, and 
thus an area most certainly in need 
of student voices, is in the hiring 
of the University’s president and 
executive officers, including the 
provost and vice president for 
student life. When former Provost 
Martha Pollack was announced as 
the incoming president of Cornell 
University, we immediately called 
on University President Mark 
Schlissel to include a University 
student on the search committee 
for 
her 
replacement. 
We’re 

thankful he honored our request, 
ultimately placing a graduate 
student on the committee. It 
is essential that students are 
included on search committees 
for key University personnel. CSG 
must continue to be the driving 
force behind that ideal, always 
challenging administrators to be 
responsive to students’ needs.

Just recently, to ensure that 

student participation would be 
guaranteed in the process of 
crafting and then recommending 
student fees, we worked with 
Student 
Life 
administration, 

including E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life, and Anjali 
Anturkar, associate vice president 
for student life, to establish the 
Student Fee Advisory Committee. 
The Committee’s central purpose 
is to “ensure student participation 
and engagement in advancing 
student 
needs 
through 
the 

recommendation of student fees.” 

We must also establish and 

maintain 
strong 
relationships 

with city officials to ensure our 
voices are being heard beyond the 
peripheries of campus. As is so 
often the case, local issues become 
campus issues, while campus 
issues grow into city-wide issues. 
In a wide array of areas, from off-
campus street lighting and general 
student safety to policies about 

student voter registration and the 
locations of polling stations, city 
initiatives invariably impact our 
lives as college students. For this 
reason, however fleeting each 
student’s stay in the city is, we must 
truly care about what happens in 
Ann Arbor.

With this in mind, since being 

elected into office, we have worked 
to institutionalize mechanisms 
for student participation in the 
Ann Arbor city government. Our 
efforts came to fruition on Jan. 17, 
when the Ann Arbor City Council 
passed a resolution to establish the 
Student Advisory Council. This 
council brings together members 
of the City Council and students 
from the University and the Ann 
Arbor Public School system to more 
effectively promote dialogue and 
increase collaboration on policies, 
programs and actions affecting 
these different stakeholders.

All told, we deeply believe 

that the strength of any student 
government rests on the scope 
of its advocacy, as well as its 
commitment to empowering the 
voices of all University students. We 
strongly recommend that future 
CSG 
administrations 
continue 

to facilitate the mobilization of 
students at the University, city and 
state levels. This will, over time, 
enable students to accumulate 
greater 
staying 
power, 
only 

increasing the seriousness with 
which their concerns and causes 
are addressed.

We end our administration 

the same way that we started 
it: with an undying belief in the 
importance 
of 
student 
voice. 

When all of us feel comfortable 
and are given the opportunity 
to exercise our voices — to share 
our lived and learned experiences 
with others — we can elevate the 
narratives of every student. Our 
lasting piece of advice to our fellow 
students is to never doubt our 
collective presence as the central 
stakeholder at the University of 
Michigan — the beating heart 
within the complex body that is 
our Michigan.

 FARHAD SHIRANI | OP-ED

As stated in the commission’s 

report, it is vital that Michigan 
works to financially invest 
more in schools for any tangible 
change in the state’s education 
system to occur. Since 2000, 
the United States has increased 
spending by $1,400 per student, 
while Michigan has decreased 
spending on students by $663 
each. This figure has been on 
the rise since Snyder’s initial 
education cuts in 2011, but still 
falls short of pre-recession 
levels of education spending. 
It is extremely important that 
the state invests in education 
for the well-being of students. 
Various studies have shown 
that quality education is crucial 
for the success of children over 
the course of their entire lives, 
and that families who cannot 
afford to send their children 
to private schools should have 
equal access to comparable 
education in public schools.

The 
commission 
suggests 

allocating between $110 million 
and $900 million annually to 
provide additional resources to 
disadvantaged students, up to 
$75 million annually for teacher 
preparation and professional 
development 
programs 
and 

$70 million toward putting 
human services in schools that 
largely serve students of low 
socioeconomic status. However, 
the report doesn’t detail exactly 
how these funds should be put 
to use, and an “indeterminate” 
amount of funds is allocated 
toward many of the initiatives 
the commission suggests. The 
lack of clarity poses the danger 
of investing money thoughlessly. 
Further research must be done 
to ensure appropriate funding 
is allocated to education reform 
measures 
suggested 
in 
the 

report.

Making 
preschool 
and 

community colleges free for 
residents of Michigan is also 
an important step to help give 
all children and young adults 
access to education, regardless 
of their socioeconomic status. 
While not easy tasks, these are 
critical steps to help mitigate the 
gap in educational attainment 
between students of low and 
high 
socioeconomic 
status. 

Preschool, according to the 
commission, has been shown 

to improve school readiness. 
Eliminating costs for enrolling 
children in the education system 
early would benefit every child 
who would otherwise be unable 
to attend preschool, and create 
a better foundation for a child’s 
learning 
abilities. 
Preschool 

not only fosters social and 
emotional development, but also 
language and cognitive skills, 
which would in turn promote a 
successful education career.

Furthermore, free community 

college 
would 
increase 
the 

number of college graduates 
in the state and significantly 
decrease the gap between low- 
and middle-income students’ 
enrollment. Even though this 
plan is not concrete policy yet, 
free post-secondary education 
can benefit many people and 
the state should seek to make 
this plan a reality in the near 
future. Free schools, especially 
community 
colleges, 
are 

something that politicians such 
as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt) 
and former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton have fought 
for, belieivng equal access to 
equitable education is a right 
that 
everyone 
should 
have. 

During his time in office, former 
President Barack Obama created 
a board that was working to 
make 
two-year 
community 

colleges 
free 
and 
included 

people such as former Wyoming 
Gov. Jim Geringer (R) and Jill 
Biden. Some states, like Oregon, 
have programs in place to offer 
free community college tuition 
to 
certain 
students. 
States 

such as California, Wisconsin 
and Illinois have introduced 
similar programs. Additionally, 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 

community colleges are taking 
it upon themselves to offer free 
tuition to in-state students.

The 
commission 
also 

endorses 
establishing 
merit-

based scholarships for Michigan 
residents 
to 
attend 
public, 

in-state 
universities. 
While 

these goals are sensible, they are 
not flawless. First, scholarships 
based on “merit” can create an 
unequal playing field depending 
on the metrics used to define 
it. For example, standardized 
testing scores as a marker of 
merit is more dependent on 
one’s ability to afford test-prep 

courses and tutoring than on 
sheer effort and intelligence. 
The commission report suggests 
using GPA as the main scholastic 
marker of achievement and 
requiring students to fill out the 
FAFSA to become eligible for 
this award, which would help 
favor high-performing students 
who 
demonstrate 
financial 

need. The commission’s report 
is positive in its insistence 
that post-secondary education 
is an absolute necessity, and 
should thus be a priority and 
responsibility of the state.

Nevertheless, 
there 
are 

some concerning portions of 
the commission’s report. One 
example is the commission’s 
suggestion 
to 
replace 
the 

elections for State Board of 
Education and give the state 
governor the power to appoint 
the board. The commission 
report 
argues 
a 
governor-

appointed 
board 
would 

allow the state to implement 
education reform policies more 
efficiently, since the governor 
would be in charge of the state 
and the Board of Education. 
This is concerning as Snyder 
has not managed to appoint 
officials 
who 
successfully 

managed other crises in the 
state, such as the failing of 
Detroit’s public schools and the 
Flint water crisis. Detroit public 
schools are still not performing 
up to par, and Flint still doesn’t 
have clean water. Additionally, 
we are concerned that governor-
appointed 
officials 
lack 

accountability toward residents 
of Michigan.

Given the dismal state of many 

of Detroit’s public schools and the 
continual repercussions of the 
Flint water crisis, this commission, 
though imperfect, is an important 
step in the right direction. Of 
course, there must be more than 
simply first steps, and these 
changes will not happen overnight. 
But these recomendations will 
help guide the state of Michigan’s 
education system in a more 
positive direction. If Michigan 
is to prepare children for the 
“careers, 
lives, 
and 
futures 

to which they aspire,” as this 
report indicates, we must take 
the findings of the commission 
seriously and work to shape a 
better path forward.

The American 

dream, the 

human dream, 
is the ideal that 
every human 
being should 
have an equal 
opportunity to 
achieve sucess.

FROM THE DAILY

Education reform is necessary
A

t the end of February, the state of Michigan published the findings 
of the 21st Century Education Commission report. The commission 
consisted of many education experts, largely appointed by 

Gov. Rick Snyder (R), with the goal of outlining recommendations for 
improving Michigan’s education system. This report found that, while 
implementing some changes will be more difficult than implementing 
others, change is necessary. Currently, Michigan public school students 
are egregiously underperforming: Michigan ranks 41st in the nation in 
fourth-grade reading performance, and eigth-grade math performance 
is also declining significantly. The report emphasizes increased funding 
for public education and other related programs as well as universal 
access to preschool and community college. It also calls for a transition 
from a voter-elected to a government-appointed Michigan State Board 
of Education. Therefore, while the commission’s report certainly 
has its flaws, the Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board believes it is the 
responsibility of the state to take these findings and institute changes in 
Michigan’s public school system.

FILM REVIEW

“Pachinko”

Min Jin Lee

Feb. 7, 2017

Grand Central 

Publishing 

BOOK REVIEW
‘Pachinko’ an intimate yet 
expansive immigrant tale

New novel explores the intersections of family and heritage

Min Jin Lee’s second novel is 

a sprawling saga about a Korean 
family 
during 
the 
Japanese 

occupation of Korea. Spanning 
four 
generations, 
“Pachinko” 

explores questions of immigration, 
discrimination, political unrest 
and national identity. The family’s 
mindset is introduced in the 
opening line: “History has failed 
us, but no matter.” Their resilience 
is woven through the rest of the 
novel, a tale of an ordinary family 
that tumbles and endures.

Lee’s straightforward yet fluid 

prose 
contextualizes 
personal 

stories within the wider scope 
of political history. The novel 
spans from 1910 to 1989, and first 
introduces readers to Hoonie, a 
poor countryside boy in Korea. 
His wife, Yangjin, takes charge 
of their humble boarding house, 
toiling long hours to put food on 
the table of the unofficial family of 
boarders and maids packed in the 
small quarters.

When 
Yangjin’s 
daughter, 

Sunja, gets pregnant out of 
wedlock, she enters a marriage of 
convenience with a visiting Korean 
minister. The couple migrates 
to Osaka, where Koreans are 
treated as second-class citizens. 
They struggle to make Japan their 
home, since the Korea they know 
as “home” eventually splits into 
North and South Korea, and their 

family and friends scatter.

Their 
children 
Noa 
and 

Mozasu, 
as 
second-generation 

immigrants, face a different set 
of struggles. Born in Japan, but 
ethnically Korean, they embody 
an in-between state between 
cultures that makes them question 
their identity. They 
grew up attending 
Japanese 
schools 

and 
assimilating 

to the culture, yet 
they 
are 
never 

fully 
accepted 
by 

Japanese classmates 
and employers. On 
the other hand, they 
are removed from 
the experience of 
growing up in Korea, 
so they lack a strong emotional tie 
to a single nation.

Meanwhile, 
political 
unrest 

continues, changing lives for 
both the Koreans and Japanese 
in the story. Japan is rumbled 
by its involvement in World War 
II, changing the socioeconomic 
landscape of the family’s story 
once again.

These 
political 
events 

transpire in the backdrop. They 
appear indirectly, in the way 
they impact characters’ daily 
lives, relationships and decision-
making. What makes Lee’s novel 
so rich is the use of national politics 
as a foundation upon which a set 
of fully developed characters is 
built, molding a unique family 
identity that blends culture with 
the personal.

The novel’s title, “Pachinko,” 

which 
refers 
to 
a 
Japanese 

gambling machine, is a fitting 
descriptor 
of 
the 
immigrant 

experience. 
It’s 
the 
family’s 

gamble of moving to another 
country, 
the 
questions 
and 

confusions that come with the 

unknown. 
It’s 

a 
gamble 
with 

the odds stacked 
against 
them, 

forcing immense 
sacrifice, 
pain 

and loss.

Yet at the same 

time, working at 
a pachinko parlor 
is the occupation 
that 
eventually 

helps the family 

establish 
themselves. 
It’s 
a 

gamble that holds the beaming 
hope that through hard work and 
resilience, families can win the 
opportunity to etch their story 
permanently into the history and 
community of a new country.

“Pachinko” is a novel that 

winds 
through 
lifetimes, 

cycling through new worlds as 
the political climate evolves. 
But whether the world involves 
Korean 
countrysides, 
tightly 

sealed 
bottles 
of 
kimchi, 

urban ghettos, police visits or 
university schooling, one force 
remains present throughout: 
The fierce loyalty the characters 
have to protect the people they 
love. Through the web of family, 
four generations ultimately find 
home.

VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

The notion of history repeating 

itself is a well-known adage, 
but rarely has it been pleaded 
with as much fervor as by 
Abigail Child, whose film “Acts 
and Intermissions” played at 
the Ann Arbor Film Festival 
this past Saturday. “Acts and 
Intermissions” retells the life 
of Emma Goldman in America. 
Goldman, a Russian Jew who 
moved to America at age 16, 
quickly became a leader of 
anarchist-communists and later 
defended other causes. By the 
time of her death in 1940, she 
had taken on capitalism in the 
Industrial Era, militarism during 
World War I and gender politics 
during the suffrage movement 
(though 
her 
politics 
strayed 

from the suffragettes, for she 
reviled political participation). 
Goldman was a radical rebel, 
giving speaking tours around the 
country and calling for political 
assassinations.

“Acts and Intermissions” tells 

Goldman’s story in the United 
States, from her auspicious rise 
among her peers, to her rhetorical 
peak, to, lastly, her retreat back 
to Europe. The film is a collage of 
archival film stock from the past 
century — even the present — 
and reenactments of Goldman’s 
life, solitary and with peers, 
captured in grainy black-and-

white. Snippets from Goldman’s 
personal 
diaries 
and 
other 

contemporary texts are read 
aloud by a voice actor. The voice, 
disembodied and omnipresent, 
is defined by its strong Russian 
accent, with a tone that indicates 
a sort of weathered smugness, a 
jovial disdain for the lesser minds 
of capitalism and statism.

Like its subject, the film’s 

form 
is 
radical, 

too. By juxtaposing 
archival 
footage 

with 
present-day 

cell phone footage 
of protests around 
the 
country, 

Child’s film invites 
its 
audience 
to 

contemplate 
how 

we 
think 
about 

political disruptors 
nowadays. 
In 
a 

comment 
before 

the 
screening, 
the 
director 

explained she hoped to combine 
genres in the film. The result 
does not clearly demonstrate this 
idea — though there are clear 
elements of film noir and kitchen 
sink drama, two disparate genres 
— but perhaps that’s the point. 
Life and the struggles contained 
therein aren’t easily definable; the 
films that seek to answer the core 
questions of life needn’t be either.

For Child, the correctness of 

Goldman’s convictions is beyond 
question; 
the 
only 
question 

is how Goldman’s ideals are 
translated to the present. Child’s 

argument isn’t subtle: Those 
chanting in the streets, calling 
for a $15 minimum wage or to 
oppose 
low 
quality 
working 

conditions, are her heroes and 
model citizens. Child did not 
expressly advocate for radical 
political killing, her outward 
criticism of President Donald 
Trump and her celebration at 
his 
recent 
healthcare 
defeat 

notwithstanding, 
but the message is 
clear: don’t trust 
elites.

The 
most 

jarring shot in the 
film comes fairly 
late. We’ve come 
to recognize the 
actress 
playing 

Goldman. 
After 

all, her face is 
occasionally 
shown 
before 

or after an actual image of the 
historical figure, plus she wears 
a long string of earrings that 
would seem out place a hundred 
years ago. But in one brief 
sequence, we see the actress in 
the staged room, dressed in her 
regular 21st century pedestrian 
clothes, seeming to indicate that 
Emma Goldman was not some 
anomaly: She’s a role anyone 
could play. Save for a moment in 
Haskell Wexler’s “Medium Cool,” 
another film about protest, it’s a 
pertinent shot that captures the 
real behind the screened quite 
unlike anything I’ve seen before.

Richard Madden stars in Amazon’s new “Oasis”
‘Oasis’ is a stunning pilot

Technically beautiful, emotional ‘Oasis’ sets strong precedent

There’s no better feeling than 

watching a well-executed pilot. 
It’s invigorating knowing that 
there’s a new show with endless 
possibilities — like there’s a vast 
world just waiting to be explored. 
I came away with this feeling after 
watching the premiere episode for 
Amazon’s latest science-fiction 
project, “Oasis.” The pilot dazzles 
with 
its 
distinct, 
compelling 

storyline and an accompanying 
soundtrack that perfectly matches 
the dark tone of the series.

Examining the intersection of 

religion and space travel, “Oasis” 
follows a devoted chaplain, Peter 
Leigh (Richard Madden, “Game 
of Thrones”), as he accepts an 
invitation to join a conglomerate 
colonizing a new planet. Serving 
as 
the 
company’s 
religious 

resource for its employees, Leigh 
begins to discover the truth 
about the corporation and the 
planet itself. It’s a premise that 
is as new as it is exciting and 
provocative. The show’s unique 
setup prompts thought-provoking 
questions about the future of 
space exploration and the role 
that private companies have in 
this developing industry. Drawing 
inspiration from famed works 
like “28 Days Later” and “1984,” 
the series’ dystopian undertones 
are 
especially 
intriguing 
and 

entertaining 
to 
watch. 
The 

corporation is often portrayed as a 
sort of Big Brother, with one of the 
planet’s scientists claiming about 
the company: “They monitor the 

planet, and they monitor us.”

Complementing 
“Oasis” 
’s 

powerful narrative is a gorgeous 
original 
score. 
Composed 
by 

Martin Phipps (“Peaky Blinders”), 
the soundtrack uses primarily 
sweeping organ sounds mixed 
with low guitar notes to create 
an 
ominous 

atmosphere 
of 

mystique 
and 

intrigue. 
The 

score 
bears 

resemblance to that 
of another similar 
space drama, “Interstellar,” in 
its reliance on the organ. The 
organ sounds used in “Oasis” 
seem especially fitting for a show 
addressing the idea of religion on a 
newly colonized planet. The entire 
series benefits from the incredible 
original score, with its thundering 
crescendos synching up perfectly 
with powerful scenes in the show.

Along 
with 
its 
beautiful 

soundtrack, one of the biggest 
strengths 
of 
“Oasis” 
is 
its 

cinematography, which features 
stunning wide shots of the series’s 
desert 
planet. 
Displaying 
the 

planet’s mountainous sand dunes 
and 
arid 
conditions, 
“Oasis” 

decides to leave most of these 
breathtaking shots for the second 
half of the pilot, ostensibly to 
build excitement among viewers. 
The delay is ultimately worth it, 
as audiences are rewarded with 
outstanding vistas and vibrant 
night skies. These scenes highlight 
the extent of the planet’s emptiness 
and reveal that much of its area 
remains unexplored, adding to the 
overall sense of mystery attached 
to the show. In an strong example of 
this type of shot, “Oasis” includes a 

scene in which the camera follows 
one of the company’s drones as it 
patrols the nearby areas from the 
sky. Such a shot allows the show 
to slowly introduce viewers to the 
planet, while also hinting at the 
corporation’s ulterior motives and 
advancing the storyline.

Led by Madden, 

the cast of “Oasis” 
delivers 
strong, 

emotionally 
complex 
performances. 
Madden 
more 

than lives up to his lead billing 
and is instantly likeable due to 
his staunch commitment to his 
values and perpetual optimism. 
Alongside Madden is fellow Game 
of Thrones veteran Mark Addy 
(“Still Standing”), whose reflective, 
pensive character leaves a lasting 
impression on audiences. While 
his screen time is limited, Michael 
James Shaw (“Limitless”) similarly 
excels, giving his lines powerfully 
and adding further emotional 
weight to the series. Playing the 
show’s antagonist, Anil Kapoor 
(“Slumdog Millionaire”) does well 
to create a complex character with 
emotional depth that nearly wins 
over viewers despite his prominent 
role in the shady conglomerate. 
Kapoor’s 
character 
highlights 

one of the most unique features of 
“Oasis” ’s cast — each performer is 
instantly likable almost regardless 
of their role.

It may only be a pilot, but 

“Oasis” makes an outstanding 
first impression with its distinct 
plotline and excellent production 
values, and the show appears 
primed to be Amazon’s next 
television success.

‘The Pink Egg’ is a confusing, 
disturbing visual spectacle

INDEPENDENT RELEASE

Still from indpendent realeas “The Pink Egg”

Daily Arts Writers review Ann Arbor’s 55th Film Festival 

Most of the time I was 

confused. Then I was kind of 
grossed out. At the end I was 
just tired.

“The Pink Egg” is a 71-minute 

film depicting the actions and 
habits of seven insect species. 
However, this is not a Discovery 
Channel kind of documentary 
on insect behavior; it is acted 
out by humans in a variety 
of 
brightly 
colored, 
form-

fitting bodysuits and a weird 
collection of sound effects. The 
film contains no dialogue, no 
subtitles, no context. The viewer 
is submerged into director Jim 
Trainor’s hypothetical people-
bug universe with no clue as 
to what is actually happening. 
The 
director 
offered 
some 

insight before the screening 
of the film by describing his 
witnessing of a wasp preying 
on a grasshopper and the odd 
behavior it exhibited. Without 
that disturbing nugget, there 
is no way the audience would 
have had any idea what was 
occurring on the screen.

No plot was evident and 

characters were ambiguously 
identified by the stripes on their 

adult unitards, but nothing was 
actually defined or clarified 
throughout the film. The sex 
scenes between the female and 
male wasps — if they even were 
wasps, I honestly don’t know — 
were a memorable recurrence. 
The female would take a jar 
out of her purse after the 
male had caressed her face or 
rubbed her arm, 
then 
the 
male 

would 
continue 

to secrete white 
lotion 
from 
a 

bottle. 
This 

exact 
sequence 

happened 
about 

ten 
times. 
The 

teletubby look-a-
like people-bugs 
also 
indulged 

themselves in yellow martinis, 
perhaps representing pollen, 
covered in yellow cereal like 
Corn Pops and Honeycombs. 
Accompanying 
the 
yellow 

drinks 
was 
a 
plethora 
of 

uncomfortable 
slurping 

noises 
reminiscent 
of 
your 

grandfather 
loudly 
inhaling 

soup on Thanksgiving.

Most 
of 
the 
sounds 
in 

the movie seemed odd and 
unnatural. Trainor explained 
that all the sound was added 
post-production, mostly from 
free 
internet 
sources. 
Some 

of the most delightful sounds 
came from Caroline Nutley’s 
(Trainor’s 
wife) 
playful 

soundtrack. 
Nutley’s 
smooth, 

pleasant vocals contrasted nicely 
with the absurdity on the screen.

The 
set 
was 
constructed 

into what looked like a poorly 
built playground. It consisted 
of brightly painted plywood 

structures 
and 

many 
cardboard 

cocoons 
pasted 

together with duct 
tape. The childish 
set 
paired 
well 

with 
the 
arts-

and-crafts nature 
of the costumes 
and props. While 
the colors and set 
evoked childhood, 

the movie is not meant for 
children. Parts of the film include 
nudity and graphic cannibalism, 
attempting 
to 
capture 
the 

natural phenomenon of wasp 
larvae eating the partially living 
grasshoppers where their parent 
laid them to hatch.

“The Pink Egg” cast boasted 42 

actors, all playing different roles 
as insect, sex partner and prey, 
but the theater barely attracted 
that many viewers. Overall, the 
film was disturbing, hard to 
sit through and impossible to 
understand.

FILM REVIEW
CONCERT REVIEW
Alina Baraz captivates

R&B artist delivers a dreamy performance at El Club 

Even well before Alina Baraz 

stepped on stage at El Club, the 
crowd that had gathered was a 
live wire. Packed from wall to 
wall, the dim lighting of the 
venue illuminated bright eyes 
and reflected off of animated 
faces; the energy in the room 
was palpable, with every person 
turned 
expectantly 
toward 

center stage in preparation for 
the main attraction herself.

When Alina Baraz finally 

appeared, 
yellow 
jacket 

and 
sweet 
smile 
subtly 

commanding 
attention, 
the 

crowd exploded, filling the 
air with delighted screams 
and shouts. Baraz smoothly 
transitioned into her opening 
song, 
“Show 
Me,” 
to 
an 

audience already glowing with 
vibrancy. It was the perfect 
beginning.

And 
Baraz 
did 
not 

disappoint. 
Never 
faltering 

throughout the entirety of 
the show, she executed every 
song, from dreamy “Pretty 
Thoughts” to dynamic “Drift,” 

with an effortless grace. Baraz 
looked like she was born to 
be on that stage, backlit by 
hazy lights and producing 
music that flowed and danced 
around the crowd. For just 
under an hour, she held our 
attention with alluring vocals 
and layered melodies dripping 
smooth sensuality like honey.

For 
a 
relatively 
up-and-

coming artist, Alina Baraz’s 
absolute 
confidence 
and 

established 
stage 
presence 

was a welcome surprise. She 
filled the small venue but 
didn’t overpower it, producing 
a sense of intimacy that was 
only further accentuated by 
dim 
lighting 
and 
minimal 

extravagancy.

An artist of little words, 

Baraz said little throughout 
the night, preferring to let her 
music do most of the talking. 
Rather than distancing herself 
from the audience, the lack 
of repertoire helped build an 
atmosphere of quiet reverence 
and familiarity. Even in the 
very back of the crowd, I felt 
like Baraz was singing to 
solely me, making sure I lived 
through every beat of the song 

alongside of her.

However, 
the 
strongest 

element 
of 
Baraz’s 

performance, beyond even the 
music itself, was the dedication 
and 
appreciation 
apparent 

in every aspect of the show. 
From the way she handled 
every note with delicate care 
to 
the 
way 
she 
profusely 

thanked the crowd near the 
end of the show, Alina Baraz 
grounded the show in mutual 
respect and gratitude. It was 
a transcending experience to 
be a part of. By the time Baraz 
and her band members stepped 
offstage, not one person in the 
audience wanted to leave the 
magic behind; we immediately 
began shouting for an encore, to 
which Baraz happily complied.

Through her music, Alina 

Baraz made wildflowers grow 
from the concrete of El Club; 
beauty and poise intertwined 
themselves 
with 
dazzling 

harmonies to create a show 
that was almost fantastical. 
And if the two new songs Baraz 
played had anything to say 
about her future projects, there 
are only even more enchanting 
prospects ahead.

‘Love’ and the weaponization 
of grand romantic gestures

If you first stumbled upon the 

Netflix series “Love” and had only 
seen its title, you might assume it’s 
something completely different 
from what it actually is. The title 
“Love” seems well-suited for an 
anthology series, an ensemble 
show surveying different kinds 
of love and relationships — a TV 
equivalent of “Love, Actually,” 
or something like Netflix’s own 
“Easy.”

In reality, though, the title 

“Love” should be read sarcastically; 
it should come equipped with a set 
of quotation marks around it, to 
emphasize that what we’re seeing 
isn’t meant to be a romantic tale of 
soul mates who find each other and 
live happily ever after. Or maybe 
the quotes aren’t necessary. Maybe, 
by leaving the quotes out, creators 
Judd 
Apatow 
(“Crashing”), 

Lesley Arfin (“Girls”) and Paul 
Rust (“Comedy Bang! Bang!”) are 
telling us that this is the reality of 
love. It might be different from the 
romantic notions most of us have, 
but it’s the way it is.

The 
clearest 
examples 
of 

how “Love” subverts traditional 
rom-com expectations lie in the 
ending of each season. The first 
season ends with a confrontation 
between Mickey and Gus, our 
two 30-something Los Angelenos 
trying to make it work. Mickey 
calmly explains to Gus why they 
can’t be together, at least right now: 
She’s a sex and love addict, hopping 
from relationship to relationship 
because something inside her 
believes that they will give her life 
meaning. How does Gus respond? 
Does he nod in understanding and 
drive home to leave her alone? No. 
He kisses her. Cut to credits.

It’s the grand romantic gesture, 

the explosive, joyful climax to a 
romance movie — except it isn’t. 
It’s clear to everyone watching 
that this isn’t the right choice, for 
neither Gus nor Mickey. By kissing 
Mickey, Gus is basically handing a 
fifth of vodka to an alcoholic, just 
because he doesn’t want to drink 
alone. Not even shitty vodka, like 
Crystal Palace. I’m talking good 
vodka. Gus is handing Mickey 
a chilled bottle of Grey Goose. 
(Let’s be honest: I don’t drink Grey 
Goose. My idea of ‘good vodka’ is 
pink lemonade Burnett’s. I’ll make 
sure to go back and revise this piece 
in ten years, once I’ve learned what 
adults actually drink.)

Season two similarly ends with 

a strategic act of manipulation, 
disguised as a grand romantic 
gesture. This time, the script is 
flipped: Gus is, for once, honest with 
Mickey, and she’s the manipulator. 
Gus explains early that day that he 
now realizes how suffocating and 
impatient he has been with her. It’s 
a rare moment of genuine growth 
for the character — and it comes at 

precisely the wrong time.

Mickey has already fallen back 

into her ex-boyfriend Dustin’s 
arms. She tries to frantically 
fix things, dumping Dustin and 
running back to Gus, but the 
damage is done. Instead of being 
honest with Gus, she abruptly 
suggests that they be in a committed 
relationship, dragging him into 
another room to have sex just so 
her hiding ex-boyfriend can make 
a quick escape. Mickey is pulling a 
page from Gus’s book, weaponizing 
affection and commitment just to 
get what she wants.

If the show’s creators were 

looking for a longer sardonic 
title, they could’ve chosen “Love 
Conquers All.” Gus and Mickey’s 
hasty, unwise romantic gestures 
aren’t just manipulative tools used 
to cure their loneliness and cover 
up their secrets. More broadly, 
their reliance on declarations of 
love and commitment is a symptom 
of our “love conquers all” culture. 

Countless romantic comedies tell 
us that all you really need to make a 
relationship work is love; if you love 
each other enough, any obstacle 
can be surmounted. In reality, of 
course, love isn’t the only factor 
that determines the success of a 
relationship.

Everyone 
in 
“Love” 
wants 

to rush to the happy ending. 
They want to put in motion the 
narratives they’ve conceived of 
for themselves that invariably end 
with happiness. Gus thinks he 
can ignore the danger of Mickey’s 
addiction, because he thinks he’s 
an exception; he constantly plays 
the hero, imagining Mickey as 
a puzzle he can solve. Mickey 
rejects this condescending notion, 
even though a part of her wants to 
believe he can fix her.

Even Dustin has his own 

narrative of how things play out. 
During the second season finale, 
he repeatedly tries to win Mickey 
over, telling her, “This is the story 
we’re going to tell our kids. ‘Your 
mom was dating a loser, and I 
chased after her.’” Dustin thinks of 
himself as the hero of this story the 
same way Gus does.

To Dustin, Gus and even 

Mickey, 
the 
grand 
romantic 

gesture is the final move in their 
hero’s journey; commitment is 
synonymous with happiness. After 
that, everything will somehow 
be better. And if it isn’t, well, 

at least there’s the comfort of 
familiarity. “They say that you go 
back to painful situations because 
they’re comfortable and familiar,” 
Mickey tells her roommate Bertie, 
reflecting on her dalliance with 
Dustin. “I hear that,” Bertie agrees, 
before saying one of the funniest 
lines of the season: “Sometimes 
when I’m in pain, I’m like, ‘Hello, 
old friend.’”

What 
the 
characters 
don’t 

understand, but what “Love” itself 
understands, is that you can’t 
really earn those grand romantic 
gestures until you’ve put in the 
work and experienced all the little 
things first. The purest moments 
of romance in the second season 
happen in episodes four and five, 
when practicality and low-key 
sweetness 
outweigh 
romantic 

ambition.

In an episode titled “Shrooms,” 

while sitting together in bed, Gus 
tells Mickey she’s beautiful, like 
a movie star from the ’30s. She 
tells him he’s beautiful, too, and 
he scoffs, saying, “No, you don’t 
have to say that. I know I’m not 
one of the beautiful people. I’ve 
got this nose … it’s weird-looking, 
and big.” Mickey tells him that 
she loves his nose. It’s a beautiful, 
understated moment — simpler 
than a grand romantic gesture, but 
more sincere.

That same vibe pervades the 

following episode, “A Day.” “A 
Day” follows the model of other 
masterful episodes like “Looking 
for the Future” from “Looking,” 
or “Nashville” from “Master of 
None.” Gus and Mickey just hang 
out for a while, getting to really 
know each other. For once, they’re 
able to just exist together, to have 
good conversations and make each 
other laugh and learn how much 
they actually like each other, 
complicated hero complexes and 
toxic self-sabotage briefly set 
aside.

It’s unclear how “Love” will 

end. Maybe next season will end 
on a real grand romantic gesture, 
a genuine one, free of ulterior 
motives. Maybe it’ll be a low-key 
moment, like one of the many that 
fill the early episodes of season 
two. Or maybe “Love” will end 
with Gus and Mickey realizing 
that they’re not right for each 
other, and they’ll break up.

Regardless, if Gus and Mickey 

ever want to be in a happy 
relationship, they’ll need to stop 
thinking of love as a solution to all 
their problems. Love shouldn’t be 
deployed like a last-resort nuclear 
option; it should be experienced 
slowly, patiently. What matters the 
most isn’t the kiss at the end of the 
story. It’s the sunny afternoons in 
the middle, warm days that go on 
forever and still feel like they’re 
over too soon.

Michigan 80, Virginia Tech 62

Daily Sports Writer

Wolverines advance to the WNIT semifinals for third consecutive season

Senior point guard Siera 

Thompson knew how many 
assists she needed to become 
the all-time assists leader in 
Michigan women’s basketball 
history 
before 
Saturday’s 

WNIT 
quarterfinal 
against 

Virginia Tech (20-14). She made 
sure to make every pass count. 

At the 4:42 mark in the 

fourth 
quarter, 
Thompson 

outletted the ball down low to 
junior forward Jillian Dunston. 
She returned the favor, floating 
the ball into the basket to give 
Thompson assist No. 538. When 
Thompson went to the bench 
shortly thereafter in what could 
possibly be her final game in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
her 
teammates 

showered 
her 
with 
cheers, 

accompanied by the roar of the 
Crisler Center crowd.

It was that kind of day for 

the Wolverines (26-9), who 
used 
stifling 
defense 
and 

offensive consistency to topple 
the Hokies, 80-62, and advance 
to the WNIT semifinals for 
the third consecutive season. 
Junior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty and sophomore center 
Hallie Thome led the offensive 
charge with 29 and 27 points, 
respectively.

“Everytime 
we 
step 
on 

the floor, we want to win,” 
Flaherty said. “I think we’ve 
realized that we only have a 
certain amount of games left, 
and if we’re going to be in this 
tournament, we might as well 
win it and prove people wrong.

“Just to send out the seniors 

with a championship and do 
something that’s never been 
done is really what we want to 
do.”

The two teams were nearly 

neck-and-neck after the first 
period, 
tying 
in 
shooting 

percentage at 50, rebounds 
with nine and turnovers with 
three. But Virginia Tech was 
ultimately able to take a 20-19 
lead thanks to four 3-pointers 
versus 
only 
one 
for 
the 

Wolverines. With the absence 
of 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, who is sitting out 
indefinitely due to personal 
reasons, Michigan was forced 
to balance its scoring, and 
Thompson, 
Flaherty 
and 

Thome stepped up with at least 
six points each in the quarter. 

“Our 
team 
is 
probably 

playing 
some 
of 
the 
best 

basketball it (has) played all 
season long,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “I 
think our chemistry has been 
outstanding and I think people 
have picked up the slack and 
picked up the minutes.” 

The 
following 
period 

showcased a staunch Wolverine 
defense that allowed just nine 

points for a 38-29 halftime 
lead. At one point, the Hokies 
went on a 5:11 scoring drought, 
in which Michigan went on an 
11-0 run and forced Virginia 
Tech to miss 11 consecutive 

field goals. The Wolverines 
also forced five turnovers and 
got three blocks off the bench 
from freshman forward Kayla 
Robbins. Though the scoring 
efforts stemmed mainly from 

Flaherty and Thome, it was 
Thompson who did it all in the 
half with six points, six boards 
and four assists. 

It was all Michigan the rest 

of the way. Virginia Tech scored 
13 points in the third period 
after converting on two treys 
and two and-one plays, but the 
Wolverines responded in kind 
with two and-one plays of their 
own and four 3-pointers from 
Flaherty, who had seven on the 
day.

“It’s just kind of how the 

game panned out,” Flaherty said 
of her shooting performance. 
“(Virginia Tech is) a very good 
3-point shooting team, so I 
think our goal was to kind of 
push in transition and get in 
long rebounds, but it ended up 
being that my teammates found 
me in good spots and I just felt 
more open than I usually do and 
came off some good screens.”

Up 17 points headed into the 

final quarter, the Wolverines 
continued pouring it on. Thome 
scored Michigan’s first seven 
points, and the panicked Hokies 
were battered in the paint in the 
final 10 minutes, succumbing to 
a number of rushed shots and 
unforced turnovers.

“The 
last 
few 
games 

we’ve locked in defensively,” 
Thompson said. “We’re not just 
a scoring team now, we have to 
lock in on defense. We’ve lost 
some scoring from the absence 
of Kysre, so we have to step up 
in other areas.”

With 
the 
quarterfinal 

victory, Michigan will face 
either Villanova or Big Ten foe 
Indiana, the latter of whom 
could present the Wolverines 
with 
an 
opportunity 
at 

redemption after the crushing 
loss in Bloomington that led to 
Michigan dropping three of the 
final four games of its regular 
season.

“Everytime 

we step on the 
floor, we want 

to win.”

Under Beilein, Michigan lands on two feet

W

ith under a minute 
to go in a Sweet 
16 game against 

Oregon on 
Thursday, 
DJ Wilson 
set up on 
the left 
wing to 
take a 
go-ahead 
3-pointer 
for the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team. It wasn’t the shot you’ll 
remember for years.

Before Derrick Walton Jr. 

missed that shot, Wilson lined 
up the first one that would 
have given the Wolverines 
the lead. It wasn’t as big as 
the buzzer-beater, but it was 
critical. Everyone noticed 
that he missed. Not everyone 
noticed what he did before 
that.

Maybe John Beilein didn’t, 

either. Maybe Beilein has 
coached the same shot so many 
times over 1,289 games and 
38 years that it didn’t cross 
his mind. But here’s the thing: 
Before DJ Wilson took that 
shot, he caught the ball on two 
feet.

This time, it didn’t make a 

difference. Wilson cocked, fired 
and missed. Oregon grabbed 
the rebound, and you know the 
rest: After an empty possession, 
Walton had another chance to 
win the game and missed. The 
Wolverines took two 3-pointers 
in the final minute, earned two 
good looks and missed them 
both.

Back to catching it on 

two feet, though. Why did 
Wilson do it? And why does it 
matter? Well, every fall when 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
starts practice, whether he’s 
coaching local guys at Newfane 
High School or NBA prospects 

at Michigan, he teaches his 
players to catch the ball on two 
feet so that they’re balanced.

His players don’t forget 

it. Two years ago, after 
the Wolverines ended a 
disappointing 16-16 season 
with a loss to Wisconsin in the 
Big Ten Tournament, then-
sophomore Sean Lonergan 
said: “We start off every single 
year reviewing how to pass 
and catch a ball. Catch on two 
feet. Pass with the seams so 
shooters can shoot. Everybody 
gets one-on-one instruction 
with them with their jump shot 
to make sure that you’re lifting 
up.”

A few weeks before that, 

Javone Moore — who played 
for Beilein at Canisius and 
aided the coach’s first NCAA 

Tournament run — said: “I 
remember every single thing 
he’s ever taught us. When 
you’re passing the ball, pass 
with two hands. When you’re 
catching the ball, give the guy 
a target with your outside hand 
so the guy can’t steal it.”

Sean Lonergan and Javone 

Moore played for John Beilein 
two decades apart.

But they both see the ideas 

behind Beilein’s practices. 
Asked again Saturday about his 
old coach’s tendencies, Moore 
said, “He understands that you 
need to have these little things 
before they become big.”

And Lonergan, two years 

ago: “Regardless of where he’s 
coaching, you can just tell the 
minor details — and the thing 
is, with Coach B, they’re really 

not so minor.”

When practice would start 

with such a minor drill, Moore 
admits he used to wonder: What 
the hell are we doing this for?

Fans often question Beilein, 

too. He took criticism this 
season, and some of it was fair. 
The 2013 Final Four run sure 
seemed like a long time ago 
when this year’s Michigan team 
gave up a 20-point lead against 
Virginia Tech, and when it 
started Big Ten play 1-3, and 
when it lost an ugly home game 
against Ohio State in early 
February.

But Beilein taught his players 

to catch the ball on two feet, 
and he always seemed to know 
it was going to pay off in the 
end. Moore said Saturday, 
recalling his days with Beilein, 

“He never has this panic. It’s 
almost like he sees things 
before they’re about to happen.”

This season, more than 

ever, that rang true. Whenever 
this season was about to 
veer off, Beilein stabilized 
it. Remember when you say 
his teams “live by the three, 
die by the three,” that in the 
Wolverines’ miraculous Big 
Ten Tournament run, they 
shot 6-for-25 from behind the 
arc and still upset Purdue in 
overtime, then turned around 
and hit 10 triples in the title 
game against Wisconsin. 
Remember when you say 
Beilein can’t develop big men 
that he is coaching two future 
pros. Remember when you call 
his teams “soft” that this one 
survived everything it faced on 

its way to the Sweet 16.

If the two Big Ten titles, 

National Championship Game 
berth and Elite Eight trip in 
a three-year span weren’t 
enough, perhaps this season 
will serve as a reminder that 
Beilein’s ways still work.

The season ended with one 

last second-guessed decision. 
With less than 10 seconds left 
in Thursday’s game and Oregon 
still up one, Beilein chose not 
to call timeout. Walton took 
the ball up, gained separation, 
stepped back and shot.

Some said Beilein should 

have used the timeout to draw 
up a better play, but consider 
this: The Ducks had two fouls 
to give. Beilein said afterward 
he thought they would commit 
one and that he would have 
another chance to call a play.

As it turned out, they didn’t, 

and Walton got his shot off. If 
you had asked Beilein when 
he woke up Thursday morning 
how he would feel about that 
night’s game coming down to 
his senior point guard taking a 
3-pointer to win at the buzzer, 
I’m guessing he would have 
taken it.

Of Beilein’s 1,289 college 

games, some have ended in 
shots like that. Some have gone 
in, and some haven’t. Trey 
Burke’s four years ago went in. 
Wilson’s did not. Neither did 
Walton’s.

So the season is over, and 

the miss will sting for a while. 
But Beilein’s group will have 
another run at it next year. 
Perhaps it will lead somewhere, 
and perhaps it won’t. Perhaps 
it’ll even come down to another 
last-second shot. But rest 
assured: Whatever happens, it’s 
going to start with catching the 
ball on two feet.

The evidence was all there

K

ANSAS CITY, Mo. — With 
less than two seconds 
left on the clock, Derrick 

Walton Jr. 
stepped back 
and put up a 
shot.

Unlike 

many times 
before in 
the last 
three weeks, 
the senior 
guard’s shot 
clanked 
front iron 
and rimmed out as the buzzer 
sounded.

Game over.
Final score: Oregon 69, 

Michigan 68.

It marked the end of a magical 

three-week run for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team which saw 
the Wolverines win the Big Ten 
Tournament and advance to the 
NCAA Tournament Sweet 16.

It was a run that saw them 

win in about every way possible, 
coming out victorious in a variety 
of methods including hot shooting, 
dominant big man play and stifling 
defense, among others.

For how successful Michigan 

was in March, though, it was a 
run that was unexpected by many, 
especially after the inconsistency 
the Wolverines showed during the 
year, and few gave them a chance 
at accomplishing what they did.

But even during those low 

points, all the evidence was there 
of Michigan’s capability to go 
on the run that it went on. The 
Wolverines just happened to put it 
all together in March.

***
Back in November, Michigan 

traveled to New York City to play 
in the 2K Classic. The Wolverines 
shot lights out — over 50 percent 
in both games — en route to 
victories over Marquette and 
Southern Methodist, two teams 
that would make the NCAA 
Tournament as No. 10 and No. 6 
seeds, respectively, on the way to a 
2K Classic title.

It was the first piece of evidence 

that Michigan was capable of 
being the team it has been the last 
three weeks.

Against SMU, Walton put up 

23 points on 7-of-12 shooting 
from behind the arc, and it was 
on the back of fantastic shooting 
performances from Walton and 
Co. that carried the Wolverines to 
the Sweet 16.

But, more importantly, 

Michigan played fantastic defense, 
holding both opponents under 40 
percent shooting, while shutting 
down both teams’ big men. Most 
notably, the American Athletic 
Conference’s Player of the Year, 
Mustang forward Semi Oljeleye, 
who averaged 19 points per game 
this season, was held to just 13 
points on 5-of-16 shooting.

The tournament victory was 

the best evidence of Michigan’s 
capabilities, and the type of 
play that coach John Beilein 
referenced “getting back to” as 
the season progressed.

The next piece of evidence 

came about a month later, when 
the Wolverines traveled to 
California to take on then-No. 2 
UCLA.

Michigan shot a blistering 

65.5 percent from the field — 75 
percent from behind the arc — 
and kept up with one of the best 
shooting teams in the country, 
taking a 50-50 tie into the 
halftime break.

While the Wolverines ran 

out of gas in the second half, 
losing 102-84, the game showed 
that Michigan was capable of 
sticking with the elite teams in the 
country, even if just for stretches 
at the time.

It was invaluable experience 

that helped them, especially 
against another elite team in No. 
10 Louisville in the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament, when 
the Wolverines climbed back from 
an eight-point halftime deficit to 
win.

Michigan’s next piece of 

evidence came after the New Year, 
when Nebraska came to town.

The Cornhuskers featured two 

guards in Tai Webster and Glynn 
Watson Jr., who like to push the 
pace.

In a game that featured little-

to-no defense — Nebraska scored 
1.232 points per possession, while 
the Wolverines scored 1.338 — 
Michigan prevailed by simply 
outscoring its opponent.

It was a contest similar to the 

Wolverines’ NCAA Tournament 
first round game against 
Oklahoma State, and at home on 
Jan. 14, Michigan proved that it 
could win an offensive track meet. 
 

Sandwiched between the two 

big home victories against Indiana 
and Michigan State, in which the 
Wolverines showed their offensive 
prowess, Michigan traveled to 
East Lansing to take on Michigan 
State in a game that was the 
complete opposite.

The Wolverines lacked energy 

and their offense stalled, shooting 
just 33.9 percent. But one player 
who didn’t lack energy was 
Walton, who finished with 24 
points while no other Michigan 
player finished with more than 10.

It was the first game that 

Walton carried the brunt of the 

Wolverines’ scoring, while his 
teammates struggled. The game 
was the first piece of evidence 
that Walton could be the team’s 
primary scorer and kickstarted 
a two-month period of dominant 
play from Michigan’s senior point 
guard.

While much of the evidence 

thus far in the season had been 
about the Wolverines’ offense, 
their improved defense was a key 
aspect of their March run.

And on Feb. 16 against 

Wisconsin, that was on full 
display.

With the Badgers sporting two 

dominant big men in forwards 
Nigel Hayes and Ethan Happ, 
Michigan was up to a tall task in 
defending the duo.

In the first half, the Wolverines 

looked like they weren’t up to the 
task as Happ put up 18, looking 
unstoppable in the post.

But in the second half, 

Michigan double teamed him, 
with much of the work going 
to sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner, redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson and senior 
wing Zak Irvin. With a new 
strategy, the Wolverines excelled, 
holding Happ to just four points in 
the second half.

Irvin, especially, played great 

help defense on Happ, and it was 
the first evidence of what assistant 
coach Billy Donlon called his “elite 
defense” over the course of the 
last two months of the season.

The last piece of evidence of 

Michigan’s capability of a March 
run came on Senior Day against 
Purdue.

Wagner, going up against 

an elite big man duo of Big Ten 
Player of the Year Caleb Swanigan 
and 7-foot-2 center Isaac Haas, 
the Berlin, Germany native had 
himself a game, scoring 20 points 
in the first half, on his way to what 
was a career-high 24 points before 
he broke that record against 
Louisville.

While there had been evidence 

of Wagner being able to score like 
he did against the Cardinals all 
year, it all came to fruition against 
Purdue. Wagner not only showed 
his 3-point shooting range, but 
also worked inside against the 
Boilermaker big men, as 15 of his 
24 points in the paint.

***
For much of the season, 

Michigan’s play has teetered 
between fantastic and below-
average.

The Wolverines have looked 

like world beaters against the 
best teams in the Big Ten, while 
looking lost against some of the 
Big Ten’s bottom feeders.

And while it’s easy for people 

to overreact as the season 
progresses, sometimes the 
Wolverines just haven’t looked 
like the team capable of pulling off 
a March run.

But more importantly, there 

were many times when they 
did look like a team that could 
play with the elite teams in the 
country.

And in March, they finally put 

it all together.

Speight embracing new leadership role

Wilton Speight is the guy, 

and he knows it.

It has been a long time since 

a Michigan quarterback could 
say the same. For the first time 
since 2014, the Wolverines 
know who will be taking their 
snaps behind center come next 
fall prior to spring practice.

With 
that 
certainty 
has 

come 
new 
confidence 
for 

Speight. Last year, the redshirt 
sophomore 
quarterback 

stepped into an offense laden 
with veterans like senior wide 
receivers Amara Darboh and 
Jehu Chesson and senior tight 
end Jake Butt.

They 
were 
established 

playmakers, and that allowed 
Speight to come along slower 
than he may have had he 
stepped into a starting position 
on 
a 
more 
inexperienced 

offense.

Even beyond that, Speight 

had the fortune of playing 
behind 
an 
offensive 
line 

that featured four returning 
starters 
and 
could 
easily 

alleviate the pressure placed 
on 
Speights’ 
shoulders 
— 

especially in the opening slate 
that 
featured 
Hawaii 
and 

Central Florida. 

But this year, Speight is 

the one running the show, 
expected to contribute on the 
same level that his veteran 
teammates once did. No longer 
is Speight the one benefitting 
from the experience around 
him — he’s the man expected 
to provide that experience.

Still, 
Speight 
is 
already 

embracing the leadership role 
commonly associated with his 
position.

“I wouldn’t say (he’s) more 

vocal, you can just tell,” said 
senior 
center 
Mason 
Cole. 

“You know, if you watch him 
last year during practice and 
watch him this year during 
practice he’s just got so much 
more confidence coming into 

the huddle. Just watching him 
as an individual and watching 
him run on and off the field, 
he’s got a little swagger to 
him — I know he doesn’t seem 
like that — but he’s got a little 
swagger to him.”

The changes 

have come in 
dimensions 
other 
than 

his 
approach 

to 
leadership, 

though.

In 

Michigan’s 
season-ending 
33-32 
loss 
to 

Florida 
State 

in the Orange 
Bowl, Speight played at 254 
pounds. Since then, Speight 
has lost 20 pounds through 
conditioning and diet. Cutting 
weight was a collective decision 
made between Speight and 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh.

“More speed, quicker feet in 

the pocket, I just feel healthier 

— feel like I’ve got a little 
more pep in my step,” Speight 
said. “I feel like — I just did a 
four hour practice — I could 
probably do another four hour 
practice right now. That was 
not the case toward the end of 

the season.”

What’s more, 

after playing the 
final two games 
of the 2015-16 
season 
injured, 

Speight is feeling 
100 
percent 

healthy for the 
first time since 
taking the field 
against Iowa on 
Nov. 12.

Still, there are going to be 

plenty of obstacles as Speight 
moves forward through spring 
practice and into Michigan’s 
season opener.

As Michigan’s quarterback 

described, 
toward 
the 
end 

of last year, he constantly 
knew where Darboh, Chesson 

or Butt would be on certain 
routes. Now, with the three 
biggest contributors of the 
receiving corps headed to the 
NFL, Speight is tasked with 
catalyzing an offense full of 
fresh faces. He’s not afraid to 
rely on the veterans that are 
left to help reduce that learning 
curve — and he certainly 
has ample young talent in 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, Eddie 
McDoom, Kekoa Crawford and 
Tarik Black — but Speight’s 
new desire to lead will be a 
significant determinant of the 
Wolverines’ success.

“It’s not like a, ‘Oh I hope we 

can mature and get to the point 
where we need to be,’ ” Speight 
said. “It’s more so, ‘OK I’ve got 
to make sure that we get to the 
point that we need to be.’

“And lead these guys on the 

field, and in the classroom, up 
in (Schembechler Hall), and up 
on campus — and just doing all 
the right things to show this is 
the way we do things.”

Wolverines take down 
Indiana on Senior Day

Three years ago, the Michigan 

water polo team’s future looked 
bleak. 

An early exit in the Collegiate 

Water 
Polo 
Association 

tournament prompted a coaching 
change, leading some members 
of the team to transfer and go 
to a team with better potential. 
The then-freshmen — who are 
now seniors — knew it was up to 
them to steer the team in the right 
direction.

Fast forward to March 25th, 

2017, and those seniors were 
now playing in their last game in 
Canham Natatorium. On Senior 
Day, No. 7 Michigan thrashed 
No. 15 Indiana (0-1 CWPA, 
13-7 overall), 11-6, in a game 
the Wolverines never trailed. 
Michigan (1-0, 18-8) opened up 
conference play in dominant 
fashion, 
with 
three 
players 

scoring multiple goals.

The Wolverines came out firing 

early Saturday, as sophomore 
attacker Julia Sellers scored just 
51 seconds into the game. Indiana 
quickly responded following a 
Michigan exclusion, tying the 
score at 1-1. But after a lob shot 
from sophomore defender Kim 
Johnson landed in the back of 
the net with five minutes left in 
the first quarter, Michigan took 
control for good, scoring six 
unanswered goals.

“I thought we were super 

explosive,” said Michigan coach 
Marcelo Leonardi. “The game 
plan was to attack certain people 
who 
defensively 
weren’t 
as 

athletic as us.”

Sellers and Johnson were 

the guiding force behind the 
Wolverines’ victory, as they each 
recorded hat-tricks on the day. 
Freshman utility player Maddy 
Steere scored twice.

In front of friends and family, it 

was only fitting that senior center 
Allison Skaggs and senior utility 

player Danielle Johnson each 
scored goals in their final game at 
Canham.

“It felt like we just dominated 

the entire game,” Johnson said. 
“There was never a moment 
where I was afraid we were going 
to lose.”

Added 
Skaggs: 
“It’s 
an 

incredible feeling. . . . My team did 
a really nice job of making us feel 
really special.”

Skaggs and Johnson were 

part of a sophomore class that 
welcomed Leonardi with open 
arms upon his arrival three years 
ago. They were, in essence, his 
“first class”.

“I feel like I’ve grown up with 

them,” Leonardi said. “I feel like 
they’ve made me better as a coach, 
and I’ve helped them forge their 
pathways as a student athlete.”

The Wolverines’ six seniors 

were the ones who decided to 
stick it out and stay at Michigan 
when others transferred their 
sophomore year.

“We had a rough freshman 

year . . . but I think that’s what 
makes our senior class so strong,” 
Skaggs said. “We all stuck 
together. We wanted to stay at 
Michigan.

“. . . When Marcelo came in it 

was definitely a culture shock and 
a change but it was for the better.”

Added 
Leonardi: 
“This 
is 

the group that stayed and still 
believed in what we were trying 
to build.”

That senior class has accounted 

for 87 wins and a 19-5 conference 
record in four years at Michigan. 
In 2016, the Wolverines took 
home a CWPA championship 
and finished fourth at the NCAA 
championship — the first time a 
team east of California ever made 
the semifinals.

With one month until the 

conference championship, the 
class that stuck together still has 
work to do.

“We’re here,” Johnson noted. 

“And we’re ready to win.”

Betsa throws fifth career no-hitter

After getting the final Penn 

State hitter to ground out in 
Sunday’s 17-0 rout, senior right-
hander Megan Betsa turned and 
pointed to her sophomore second 
baseman Faith Canfield as she 
trotted off the field. 

Betsa had just recorded her 

fifth career no-hitter, but as she 
high-fived her teammates before 
shaking hands with the Nittany 
Lions, she didn’t even crack a 
smile.

As 
far 
as 
no-hitters 
go, 

Sunday’s 
was 
about 
as 

nonchalant as they come.

“I actually didn’t know today,” 

Betsa said. “I actually didn’t feel 
as good today as I have felt in 
previous games.”

Eight days prior, Betsa no-hit 

Kent State in the same circle at 
Alumni Field. In between, she 
has been as dominant as they 
come. In that span, including 
both no-hitters, Betsa hasn’t 
allowed a run while striking out 
59 batters and walking just seven 
in her 29 innings of work.

After 
Friday 
night’s 
3-0 

shutout of the Nittany Lions, 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
complimented her ace while 

remaining critical of her team’s 
offensive effort.

“We’re fortunate to win the 

game in my opinion,” Hutchins 
said on Friday. We win the game 
because of Megan Betsa.”

On Sunday, though, Betsa got 

her fair share of help.

The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 

erupted, plating 17 runs in just 
four innings at the dish.

“We got more patient at the 

plate,” Hutchins said. “Once you 
get a couple runs and you get 
some people get some big RBIs, 
it frees everyone else up and 
they don’t feel the pressure. In a 
0-0 game, there’s pressure — all 
perceived pressure.”

Katie Alexander got the hit 

parade going, with a double that 
snuck inside the left-field line to 
drive in Canfield for the first run 
of the game. Junior first baseman 
Tera Blanco then followed that 
up, sitting back on a fastball and 
turning on the pitch to send a 
no-doubt, three-run shot over 
the left-field wall.

The home run was a positive 

sign for Blanco, who now has two 
home runs in her last four games 
and has generated more solid 
contact recently.

That would do it for Penn 

State’s 
short-lived 
starting 

pitcher, Marlaina Laubach, who 
was removed after recording 
only one out.

The Wolverines would go 

on to bat around in the inning 
and score five times, and are 
now averaging 2.7 runs in the 
last seven games in the opening 
frame. Additionally, Michigan 
has scored in the first inning in 
five of its last seven games.

“Especially when you’re up 

in the series, they’re just trying 
to get a game from you, (scoring 
in the first inning) puts a stake 
in it,” Hutchins said. “You could 
feel that Penn State was pretty 
deflated after the first inning. It 
was important. There’s nothing 
like getting your lead-off hitter 
on base.”

After being held scoreless 

in 
the 
second 
inning, 
the 

Wolverines’ offense — which 
was relentless on the day — 
put another eight runs on the 
scoreboard. The inning was 
highlighted by a bases-loaded 
bloop double off the bat of 
 

Canfield that scored three runs. 
The double was her sixth hit and 
accounted for her fifth and sixth 
RBI of the weekend.

The production is nothing new 

for Canfield, who has enjoyed 
a 
breakout 
campaign 
atop 

the Michigan lineup. She has 
arguably been the most consistent 
hitter for the Wolverines all 
season, with her average now 
sitting at .359 and 22 RBI.

And the runs just kept coming. 
Four more in the fourth inning 

brought the total to 17 on the 
day, a new season high for the 
Wolverines. The blowout was 
a collective team effort, as 11 
players had at least one hit for 
Michigan and eight contributed 
at least one RBI. 

But this day, just as many have 

recently, belonged to Betsa. 

In the eight days since the 

no-hitter against Kent State, 
Betsa has seemed unbothered by 
any adversity thrown her way.

Midweek 
back 
tightness 

didn’t seem to faze her. Sparce 
run support on Friday didn’t 
stop her from throwing a shutout 
gem. And on Sunday, not even 
a 30-minute delay and a rain-
soaked Alumni Field could slow 
down the red-hot Betsa.

Michigan drops Big Ten opener

Headed into its first Big Ten 

series 
of 
the 
season 
against 

Maryland, the No. 18 Michigan 
baseball team knew it had a 
daunting task ahead of it – the 
Terrapins (2-1 Big Ten, 15-8 overall) 
were selected to win the Big Ten in 
the preseason coaches poll. 

Maryland’s roster has a plethora 

of talent led by its pitching staff 
– the Terrapins rank 25th in the 
NCAA with a 3.02 strikeout-to-
walk ratio and 30th in the nation 
with 9.5 strikeouts per nine 
innings.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich – 

who coached the Terrapins from 
2009 to 2012 – was prepared for 
the tall task Maryland presented 
on the field, as well as the hostile 
environment 
in 
which 
the 

Wolverines would be playing:

“It’s College Park,” Bakich said 

on WTKA before the series. “Terp 
fans are going to be out, and it’s 
going to be a good test.” 

In the first game of the series, 

Michigan (1-2, 17-6) turned to 
its ace, junior left-hander Oliver 
Jaskie. While Jaskie was dominant 
in some aspects – he struck out 10 
batters out of his 19 total outs – the 
Terrapin batters ultimately got 
the best of the lefty, recording five 
runs in his 6.1 innings pitched.

After surrendering a first-

inning solo home run, Jaskie’s 
struggles 
continued 
in 
the 

second. Following a sacrifice fly 
that increased the lead to 2-0, 
Maryland blew the game open 
with a three-run homer by catcher 
Justin Morris.

The Wolverines came on strong 

in the top of the third, scoring two 
runs off a double down the left-field 
line from senior shortstop Michael 
Brdar. However, Michigan was 
unable to manufacture any more 
runs, falling 7-2. 

Looking for revenge in game 

two, the Wolverines got on the 
scoreboard early, scoring a run 
off an RBI triple by junior third 
baseman Drew Lugbauer in the 
top of the first. Nevertheless, 
Maryland matched Michigan’s 
run with one of its own in the 
bottom half of the inning.

The 
Terrapins’ 
comeback 

efforts became the theme of the 

game.

The Wolverines added a run 

in both the second and fourth 
innings off of two sac hits by 
sophomore second basemen Ako 
Thomas. 
However, 
Maryland 

answered with two runs of its 
own in the bottom of the fourth, 
making it 3-3. When Michigan 
scored a run in the top of the fifth, 
the Terrapins responded with a 
run in the bottom of the sixth.

Tied at four apiece in the 

bottom of the eighth, Maryland 
left fielder Madison Nickens hit a 
sac fly that produced the eventual 
game-winning score, 5-4.

Despite the loss, the Wolverines’ 

pitchers were again impressive 
with 12 strikeouts.

In the final game of the series, 

Michigan’s pitching was again 
able to blow the ball past the 
Terrapins – striking out eight 
batters. Furthermore, the offense 
was able to provide run support, 
something that had been limited 
in the previous two games.

Tied at one in the top of the 

fourth, the Wolverines took their 
first commanding lead of the 
series. With the bases loaded, 
senior centerfielder Johnny Slater 
scored on a passed ball. Michigan 
produced another run off an 
RBI single up the middle from 

sophomore left fielder Miles Lewis 
and recorded a third run coming 
off of a wild pitch, increasing the 
lead to 4-1.

The 
Wolverines 
never 

surrendered that lead, winning 6-2.

Despite 
the 
two 
losses, 

Michigan struck out an impressive 
30 batters throughout the series 
– an average of 10 per game. For 
comparison, South Florida – the 
team that ranks first in the nation 
in strikes per game – averages 11.3 
strikeouts per game.

On offense, Lugbauer continued 

his hot streak. The slugger went 
6-for-11 in the series, including his 
first three-hit game of the year.

“We have a lot of guys that 

invest a lot of time into their 
swing,” Bakich said. “I don’t know 
anyone that invests more time, 
works harder at their game than 
Drew Lugbauer.”

While it was disappointing to 

lose the series, Bakich quickly 
pointed out that what really 
matters is how the team improves 
from it throughout the rest of the 
season.

“The only rankings that mean 

anything are the final ones,” 
Bakich said. “Even the in-season 
rankings don’t mean jack squat. 
The only ranking that matters is 
how you finish at the end.”

Just like that

K

ANSAS CITY, Mo. 
— Everyone called 
them a Cinderella 

team. Everyone except the 
Wolverines. 

After 

the plane 
accident two 
weeks ago, 
the practice 
uniforms and 
the Big Ten 
Tournament 
title run, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team was living a dream. 
In those four days, the 
Wolverines blew out Illinois, 
knocked off Purdue, escaped 
from Minnesota and ran past 
Wisconsin.

Just like that, they opened 

their postseason 4-0 and had a 
trophy to show for it.

But that run started much 

earlier than Wednesday. It 
started in New York City.

Back in November, Michigan 

beat Marquette and SMU 
by a combined 40 points 
and captured a 2K Classic 
Championship at Madison 
Square Garden. Against the 
Golden Eagles, five Wolverines 
reached double-digit point 
tallies, none of whom were 
named Derrick Walton Jr. or 
Moritz Wagner. Against the 
Mustangs, seniors Walton and 
Zak Irvin scored a combined 
51 points. As a team, Michigan 
held both opponents under 40 
percent shooting from the floor 
and from beyond the arc.

Just like that, the Wolverines 

opened their season 4-0 and 
had a trophy to show for it.

The start of the Big Ten 

season couldn’t have been 
any more different. Though 
Michigan had bright spots 
in two late wins and two 
blowouts, the Wolverines lost 
their other six games. With 
a 4-6 record after a loss to 
Ohio State on Feb. 4, Michigan 

officially hit rock bottom. 

That opening run filled 

with so much optimism for 
the upcoming year looked like 
it had reached its permanent 
conclusion.

But in Ann Arbor three days 

later, that run began again.

Starting with a blowout 

win over Michigan State and 
ending with a blowout win 
over Nebraska, the Wolverines 
changed the course of their 
entire season. Ripping off a 6-2 
stretch — highlighted by upsets 
over then-No. 11 Wisconsin and 
then-No. 14 Purdue — Michigan 
finished its regular season 
with a 10-8 record. Its only 
losses during that span came 
to Minnesota in overtime and 
to Northwestern on a buzzer-
beater.

The Wolverines entered the 

Big Ten Tournament as a No. 8 
seed. They didn’t play like it.

Then they entered the 

NCAA Tournament as a No. 
7 seed. The cycle repeated in 
Indianapolis.

Against No. 10 seed 

Oklahoma State, Michigan put 
up some of its highest numbers 
of the season. Twenty-six 
points for Walton, 19 for DJ 
Wilson and 16 for both Irvin 
and Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. With an 11-for-15 
performance from beyond 
the arc in the second half, the 
Wolverines pulled off the 92-91 
win. 

Against No. 2 seed Louisville, 

Michigan received comparable 
contributions from its key 
players. Twenty-six points 
for Wagner, 17 for Wilson, 11 
for Irvin and 10 for Walton. 
Earning the edge in second-half 
points at 45-33, the Wolverines 
came back for the 73-69 win.

Michigan headed to Kansas 

City for the Sweet 16 on a six-
game winning streak. Beating 
No. 3 seed Oregon would be no 
easy task, but neither was the 
run that brought them there.

Everyone called them a 

Cinderella team. Everyone 
except the Wolverines.

“Our team is doing a great 

job with limiting distractions,” 
Irvin said. “Because I think 
it’s so easy right now to get off 
track and just lose focus, and 
I think our leadership and our 
seniors have done a great job 
with that.

“It’s been a heck of a run that 

we’re on, and we’re playing 
really well right now. We just 
don’t want it to end.”

But Thursday night, the 

magic came to an end. So too 
did Michigan’s season.

Against the Ducks, Walton 

and Irvin combined for 39 
points. Irvin hit a 3-pointer 
to take a 64-63 lead with 
3:35 remaining, and Walton 
hit another to take a 68-65 
lead with just 2:02 left. The 
Wolverines scored 35 points in 
the second half to Oregon’s 34.

But Wagner, Wilson and 

Abdur-Rahkman scored just 
21 points. Michigan’s defense 
allowed four Ducks to hit 
double figures. In the end, the 
3-pointers didn’t come in time, 
and the second-half surge never 
came.

Walton’s shot at the buzzer 

fell short, and the Wolverines 
walked away losing 69-68.

“The kids fought their hearts 

out this whole season, but 
particularly this last six weeks 
to be more than a story,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“It was a great team.”

But Thursday night, the 

story came to an end. So too did 
Michigan’s season.

Just like that.

Thompson takes top 
spot as assists leader

The aftermath was pretty 

laid-back.

There were few reporters in 

the press room following the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s win over Virginia Tech 
on Saturday. The Wolverines 
had just stomped the Hokies in 
the quarterfinal round of the 
Women’s 
National 
Invitation 

Tournament, 80-62, at Crisler 
Center.

The win earned Michigan a 

spot in the semifinals against 
either Villanova or Indiana, 
the latter of whom it split a 
Big Ten series with earlier 
this year. Multiple Wolverines 
played a starring role in helping 
Michigan achieve the feat.

But the spotlight belonged 

to senior point guard Siera 
Thompson.

During 
the 
second 
half 

of the game, Thompson was 
recognized 
as 
the 
all-time 

assists 
leader 
in 
program 

history. The arena was drowned 
in applause while celebratory 
nudges and pats on the back 
were given to the senior as she 
sat on the bench with a smile on 
her face.

“I knew how many I needed, 

but I tried not to focus on 
that and focus on the game,” 
Thompson said. “It’s still on 
the back of your mind and 
something you think about 
and something I wanted to 
accomplish. All my teammates 
are just so encouraging and 
happy for me. Without them 
I wouldn’t get assists, so it’s 
really them. They’re always 
pumping me up and so happy for 
me, and I’m so happy I was able 
to do it here at Crisler in front of 
the fans.”

The moment ended almost 

as quickly as it had started, 
though, as the arena focused 

its 
attention 
back 
on 
the 

Wolverines, who pulled farther 
and farther away from Virginia 
Tech.

Thompson finished the game 

with five assists, putting her 
career total at 540 for the top 
spot in Michigan history. She 
also recorded eight points, eight 
boards and two steals.

“My past three years here, 

I’ve always looked up to Siera,” 
Flaherty said. “She’s such a 
great scorer but puts the team 
first and distributes the ball so 
well. I mean, I’ve said so many 
times that I would be nowhere 
without her on the court.

“I really appreciate everything 

she’s done for this team, and I 
think she’s the main reason why 
we are as good as we are.”

The previous best had been in 

the hands of Anne Thorius, who 
had 537 at the end of the 1997-98 
season. Thompson has already 
surpassed that total by three, 
and still has the remainder 
of the Wolverines’ run in the 
tournament to record more.

As a senior, Thompson has 

made her mark on the program 
that will go down in statistical 
history. But for her teammates 
and coaches, the impact was 
more personal.

“She was pretty incredible 

today, on the verge of a triple-
double, not too far away,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “But just, what she has 
meant to our program and what 
she has meant to me, personally, 
has just been really, really, 
really special. She came in four

Hurst poised for breakout year

Nineteen Wolverines took 

center stage at Oosterbaan 
Field 
House 
in 
front 
of 

representatives from all 32 
NFL teams. Despite such a 
high turnout for the Michigan 
football team’s Pro Day, there 
was one notable absence.

Fifth-year senior defensive 

tackle Maurice Hurst decided 
to return to the Wolverines for 
the 2017-18 season though he 
had generated interest from 
NFL scouts. Still, he showed up 
Friday to watch his teammates 
work out for a chance to chase 
their dreams at the next level.

He could have been one of 

them. For a moment, he wished 
he was.

“It 
was 
kind 
of 
tough 

watching all of the guys work 
out without being there, just 
from all the stuff we’ve been 
through for the past four 
years,” Hurst said. “I wish I 
could have been out there with 
them working, but I was really 
excited to watch them and 
watch them do well and excel 
and just hear all of the good 
things the coaches had to say 
about them.

“I’m so happy about my 

decision 
and 
I’m 
looking 

forward to the season.”

With the loss of fifth-year 

seniors Chris Wormley, Ryan 
Glasgow and Matt Godin and 
senior Taco Charlton, Hurst 
will be relied upon to anchor 
Michigan’s defensive line this 
year.

Backing up that quartet 

last season — alongside rising 
sophomore 
defensive 
end 

Rashan Gary, rising senior 
defensive end Chase Winovich 
and rising senior defensive 
tackle Bryan Mone — Hurst 
accumulated 
34 
tackles 

(including 11.5 for loss), 4.5 
sacks, one pass breakup, one 
fumble 
recovery 
and 
one 

forced fumble.

When speaking with NFL 

representatives Friday, Hurst 
learned that he still had room 
to grow.

“Just 
consistency 
and 

production is mainly the two 

things that were sort of brought 
up,” Hurst said. “(I) definitely 
have a big year ahead, just 
make the most of it.”

This season, Hurst will have 

his first taste of the starting 
lineup, and an opportunity to 
make a difference on every 
single snap. Though he will 
have to adjust to playing more 
minutes, he won’t have to adjust 
to a new defensive system.

After turning the Wolverines 

into the top-ranked defense 
in 
the 
country, 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown earned 
a new five-year contract for 
$1.4 million per season. With 
his return, Michigan can focus 
on continuing its growth from 
last year as opposed to learning 
a new scheme.

“I 
don’t 
think 
people 

understand 
how 
much 
of 

a 
difference 
that 
makes,” 

Hurst said. “Just the same 
terminology, the same faces, 
the same people coaching you, 
it makes such a big difference 
for us. It really helps a lot of 
people. I’m able to look at a lot 
of stuff that the linebackers 
do in the secondary and able 
to learn the defense more 
holistically.”

As good as the Wolverines’ 

secondary — led by redshirt 
sophomore 
Jabrill 
Peppers 

and senior Jourdan Lewis — 
was last season, the defensive 
line was considered “the focal 
point”, 
as 
Hurst 
attested. 

He will be expected to help 
maintain that trend, especially 
with the abundance of youth 
that populates the front seven.

While Brown will certainly 

rely on his front four to 
establish the run of play, he 
also wants them to be able 
to take risks and trust that 
the 
secondary 
will 
have 

them covered. Hurst, who is 
comfortable in the playmaker 
role, was excited to learn that 
his coach wants him to take 
more chances.

“That’s something that I love 

to do,” Hurst said. “I love to 
make plays. That’s something 
that I look forward to.”

On top of his performances on 

the field, Hurst’s most important 
role next season could be as a 

mentor to Michigan’s relatively 
inexperienced defensive corps. 
Though he admitted that he is 
typically a quiet individual who 
prefers to lead by example, he 
understands the significance 
of stepping up as a more vocal 
leader.

“Just making sure the young 

guys get it and make sure they 
understand how the work is 
supposed to be done and make 
sure that they do it the right 
way,” Hurst said. “… It means 
a lot to me to be able to lead 
them and have an influence 
on them and make sure they’re 
doing everything that they’re 
supposed to.”

While 
watching 
on 
the 

sidelines 
Friday 
as 
his 

teammates made their mark 
at Pro Day could have made 
him feel like he missed out on 
a golden opportunity, Hurst 
realizes that same opportunity 
might still lie before him.

As Hurst put it: “Decision’s 

made, so now it’s just make the 
best of the situation that I’m in 
and just continue to work and 
play well.”

Brown looks for starter at VIPER

Youth.
That is the first thing that comes 

to mind when describing this 
year’s Michigan football team, and 
especially so when it comes to the 
defensive side of the ball.

The Wolverines return just 

one starter — fifth-year senior 
linebacker Mike McCray — from 
last year’s No. 1 defense. After being 
one of the most experienced teams 
in all of college football last year, 
it will be amongst the youngest 
this year — although that isn’t a 
problem for defensive coordinator 
Don Brown.

Entering his second year at 

Michigan, Brown took some time 
to reminisce, one day before the 
official start of spring practice.

“I went back and watched 

practice No. 3 of spring last year,” 
Brown. “I was like, ‘Holy moly! 
What was that?’ We’re just so 
different.”

Speaking with the media Friday 

night shortly after the conclusion of 
the first spring practice, Brown was 

clearly enthused about the potential 
of his young defense. He singled 
out players from every defensive 
unit, from freshman defensive end 
Donovan Jeter, to senior linebacker 
Mike Wroblewski, to sophomore 
defensive backs Khaleke Hudson 
and Josh Metellus.

The latter two, along with junior 

Jordan Glasgow, figure to play 
important roles in replacing one 
of the main cogs of Michigan’s 
defense last year: Jabrill Peppers.

Peppers was the starter at the 

VIPER position last season — a 
hybrid 
linebacker-safety 
role 

of sorts that involved attacking 
the line of scrimmage while 
occasionally taking on coverage 
responsibilities. He enjoyed a 
breakout season at the position, 
racking up 72 total tackles, 16 
tackles for loss and four sacks while 
earning a trip to New York for the 
Heisman Trophy ceremony.

Replacing Peppers will be a 

two-fold problem for Brown and 
Michigan.

On one hand, Peppers happened 

to be one of the “brightest” players 
Brown has ever been around. “I’d 
see the hand go up, and I’d know, 
‘Hey, you better have your stuff 
together because this question’s 
gonna have some substance to it,’ ” 
Brown said. “So he’d have his couple 
questions and when you told him 
once, it was over, it was done and it 
was handled. We really asked a lot of 
him mentally.”

Brown 
also 
praised 
the 

athleticism of Peppers — who 
wowed 
evaluators 
with 
his 

testing numbers at the NFL Draft 
Combine earlier this month. Brown 
specifically cited head coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s description of Peppers 
as the “best tackler in the country” 
as one of the traits that made him 
so special to his defense.

“You know how many calls I’ve 

gotten this winter?” Brown said. “ 
‘I’m the next Jabrill Peppers!’ No, 
you’re not. … He’s a unique talent, 
and I thought we did as good a job 
as possible trying to use him as 
much as we could. Like I told you 
before, we just gave him a bunch of 
jobs, moved him around and tried 
to complicate people’s worlds, and 
I thought that was fairly effective 
for us.”

While Brown acknowledged 

there would be “tweaking” to the 
VIPER position as he compensates 
for the lack of Peppers’ physical 
and mental acumen, he was clear 
in stating the importance of the 
position in his scheme. Brown 
pointed 
out 
that 
Michigan’s 

schedule next year is laden with 
teams that employ spread offenses, 
and in his defense, the VIPER plays 
a large role in slowing down such 
attacks.

In 
Hudson, 
Metellus 
and 

Glasgow, Brown has a trio of young 
but talented players who may fit the 
bill at Peppers’ vacated spot.

According to Brown, Hudson 

played at the VIPER during the 
first practice Friday, while Glasgow 
had some time at the spot as well. 
And Metellus, who started in 
place of an injured Peppers against 
Florida State in the Orange Bowl, 
may yet receive his shot at earning 
this year’s starting job.

“I’m going to let (Metellus) look 

at it, and we’re going to rotate 
through it,” Brown said. “... When 
Khaleke is there at the VIPER, 
we leave Josh at the strong safety 
position and Jaylen (Kelly-Powell 
is) with him. I’ve even toyed with 
the idea of giving Jaylen some work 
there (at VIPER) but his world 
right now, things are happening 
so fast, let’s get him comfortable 
and settled at the ROVER position. 
But I can rotate those guys and feel 
pretty comfortable with it.”

Similar to last year’s third 

practice, there will undoubtedly be 
rougher moments in the future that 
cause consternation. But Brown 
is pleased with the combination 
of talent and youth that he has 
seen so far — such as in players 
like Hudson, who he described as 
having an arrow pointing up — as he 
continues to look for replacements 
for Peppers and the other vacated 
spots left by graduating seniors.

“We’ll be settled and we’ll have 

our packages down and we’ll have 
a very, very solid group that’ll be 
able to compete at a high level 
despite the age,” Brown said. “I’m 
not worried about that at all. I’d 
rather be talented and young than 
the alternative — have a bunch of 
veterans and you’re going, ‘Oh my 
god, what am I going to do?’ So I’ll 
take the alternative and be happy 
with it.”
