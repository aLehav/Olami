Three construction
projects totaling
$88.3 million
up for review
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
At the University's Board of
Regents final meeting of 2011 on
Thursday, members will vote on
the proposed
Michigan NOTEBOOK
Investment in
New Technology Startups initia-
tive.
The MINTS program, which
was announced by University
President Mary Sue Coleman in
an address in October, will make
long-term investments of up to
$500,000 in start-ups created by
University faculty members as a
means of diversifying the Uni-
versity's long term investments.
The funding will be available
to any start-up that fulfills the
requirements.
"This way, again, we're not
picking winners and losers at all,"
Coleman said in October. "What
we're doing is simply saying to
the faculty start-up, '(If) you get

money from a venture capital
firm, we will automatically invest
up to $500,000.' We'll scale it
depending on what they get from
the venture capital firm."
Timothy Slottow, the Uni-
versity's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
wrote in a communication to the
regents that MINTS is estimated
to require a $25 million invest-
ment by the University over the
next 10 years, will come from the
endowment, which is currently
worth $7.8 billion.
When Coleman announced
the initiative, she said the pro-
gram offers more variation in the
University's investment portfo-
lio.
"Now I want to be clear: This
is not a new expense on the part
of the University," Coleman
said at the time. "Rather, we are
diversifying our assets."
REGENTS TO CONSIDER
$88 MILLION IN NEW

The regents will also vote on
three new construction projects
totaling $88.3 million.
The projects include a 62,500

Ali Ramlawi, the owner of

said he is upset with the slow
and prolonged construction
process.
"It's been going on for longer
than any other project Ican con-
ceive of," Ramlawi said. "The
problem is the duration."
Some of the problems Jerusa-
lem Garden is facing are a lack

of lighting and signage, lack of
parking, limited accessibility
for pedestrians and difficulty
receiving deliveries.
Ramlawi added that in fiscal
quarters since the beginning
of construction, his restaurant
has experienced up to a 20-per-
cent loss in business, which has
made the restaurant difficult
to sustain. Ramlawi expressed
his frustration with the Ann

UNIVERSITY FACULTY
Slottow: Rising
debt not an issue

'THE SOUND OF SILENCE'

'U' debt expected to
climb to $2.2B
in next five years
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and
chief financial officer, spoke
about the state of the Univer-
sity's financial health at the Sen-
ate Assembly meeting yesterday.
to At the end of fiscal year 2011,
the University had about $15
billion in assets across all three
campuses and the University
of Michigan Health System,
according to Slottow. Howev-
er, the University's $7.8 billion
endowment, a restricted fund
used to support the University's
operations, is not included in
this figure, he said.
The University currently has a
debt of about $1.8 billion, which
is expected to climb to $2.2 bil-
lion over the next five years.
However, Slottow said this is not
a problem for the University in
relation to its assets.
"The relationship of the total
assets to the total liabilities is
quite healthy," he said. "The

relationship of notes and bonds
to financial assets is also quite
healthy. So from a strictly ratio
standpoint, the University is in
good shape."
According to Slottow, the Uni-
versity has about $1.5 billion of
liquid assets, or money needed
in order to pay faculty and staff
salaries, which is sufficient
to provide a cushion for daily
expenses. The University tries to
keep expenses low, however, in
order to invest the University's
money elsewhere and accrue
profit.
"A sophisticated financial
group in the treasurer's office
wants to have as little liquid as
possible in order to invest the
rest in something that actually
has some return on our financial
assets," Slottow said. "We aren't
overly aggressive. I also would
say we're not overly conserva-
tive."
Engineering and Radiol-
ogy Prof. Kimberlee Kearfott,
vice chair of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs, asked Slottow when the
administration will start invest-
ing endowment money in faculty
start-ups.
Slottow said University Presi-

Engineers create holiday greetings website

Global Holiday
Greeting Project
allows users

By PETER SHAHEEN
Daily StaffReporter
In today's technology driven
era, traditional Christmas cards

may not be hip enough for the
Facebook generation.
Last month, the College
of Engineering launched the
"Global Holiday Greeting Proj-
ect," a website that allows Engi-
neering students and alumni to
share holiday messages, greet-
ings and memories. The site
uses a Google Map of Earth that
enables users to tag their cur-
rent location or the site of a spe-
cific memory, which is indicated

on the map by Michigan's iconic
block 'M.'
Dan Kim, executive--direc-
tor of the Office of Communi-
cations and Marketing for the
College of Engineering, said the
goal of the website was to find
an innovative way to share holi-
day greetings among the Uni-
versity's "Engineering family."
The website also demonstrates

"They do little to alleviate the
stress (from the construction),"
Ramlawi said. "They have done
very little to make sure small
businesses stay in business.
You're kind of left on your own.
The level of assistance they've
offered ... is almost insulting."
Ramlawi said he thinks the
project was not the best use of
city funds.
"For $50 million, we could be
doing a lot more for our city," he
said.
Still, Ramlawi said he is
grateful for Jerusalem Garden's
"strong following," and without
its loyal costumers, the restau-
rant may have had to close up
the shop. Ramlawi added that he
thinks the biggest challenges as
a result of the construction are
in the past, "but it has not been a
pleasant trip."
Pat Podges, vice president of
Southeastern Michigan opera-
tions for Christman Company,

tion includes the installation of
air conditioning and highspeed
Internet as well as heating and
plumbing improvements, accord-
ing to the communication.
The plans also include
increasing energy efficiency by
30 percent. Funding for the proj-
ect will come from a $20 million
gift as well as other investment
returns and funds from the Law-
yers Club.
The renovations proposed to
the Trauma Burn Center are the
first major updates since 1986
when the unit was built, Slottow
and Executive Vice President for
Medical Affairs Ora Pescovitz
wrote in a communication to the
regents. The changes include
upgrading treatment rooms and
lighting, as well as building a
physical therapy room and an
occupational therapy room.
"Since then the delivery of
medicine has changed, and
now the physical constraints-of
the unit reduce staff efficiency
and effectiveness," Slottow and
the construction company for
the project, acknowledged that
the construction is causing prob-
lems for local businesses, and the
company is highly sympathetic
to those affected.
"We understand that this
has been a disruptive process,"
Podges said.
According to Podges, the con-
struction should be finished by
the end of this coming spring,
though much of the progress
depends on the weather.
"(We) work as quickly and as
diligently as we can," Podges
said. "We certainly appreciate
their patience."
Like Ramwali, Lenore Ojib-
way, a hostess at Seva - a veg-
etarian restaurant around the
corner from the construction on
East Liberty Street - said the
long duration of the construction
is concerning.
"The costumers don't com-
plain about it, but it was supposed
to be done a year ago, and it's
frustrating," said Ojibway, add-
ing that the construction hasn't
largely impactedbusiness at Seva.

Pescovitz wrote. "The unit will
undergo renovations to improve
staff efficiency and create a more
healing environment for patients
and families."
REGENTS TO VOTE ON
MSA NAME CHANGE
The Michigan Student Assem-
bly announced at the end of last
month that it will change its
name to the Central StudentGov-
ernment starting next semester.
However, the name switch is
pending regents approval this
Thursday.
MSA President DeAndree
Watson said in an interview last
month that the change is intend-
ed to reflect the recently revised
structure of the governing body.
"(It will) help students bet-
ter understand who we are and
the role we serve on campus," he
added.
This is the first name change
for the student government
since 1976.
Herb David, owner of Herb
David Guitar Studio at 302 East
Liberty St., expressed frustra-
tion with the progress of the
construction and said it has neg-
atively affected his guitar repair
and retail shop.
"Business before this was
great ..." David said. "Business is
down (now) 45 to 50 percent"
David acknowledged that
the goal of the future parking
structure is to "create a vibrant
downtown community," but
said the construction is a major
hassle that has kept costumers
away.
The famous guitar shop, which
has catered to renowned musi-
cians such as Bob Dylan and John
Lennon, has been located on East
Liberty Street for more than 50
years. David said he hopes the
store can continue operating at its
current location, but the recent
construction and troubled econ-
omy have made it difficult for his
small business to do so.
"We've had to reduce our
staff," he said. "It's a really bad
situation."

Lowe's criticized

Lowe's Home Improvement

after the retail giant pulled ads
from a reality show about Ameri-

The retail giant stopped adver-
tising on TLC's "All-American
Muslim" after a conservative
group known as the Florida
Family Association complained,
saying the program was "pro-
paganda that riskily hides the
Islamic agenda's clear and pres-
ent danger to American liberties
and traditional values."
The show premiered last

Canada's environment minis-

Peter Kent said that Canada is

represent the way forward for
Canada or the world.
Canada, joined by Japan and
Russia, said last year it will not
accept new Kyoto commitments,
but renouncing the accord is
another setback to the treaty con-
cluded with much fanfare in 1997.
No nation has formally renounced
the protocol until now.
The protocol, initially adopted
in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, is aimed
at fighting global warming.
Canada's previous Liberal gov-
ernment signed the accord but
Prime Minister Stephen Harp-
er's Conservative government
never embraced it.

Investment in New Technol-

of University faculty start-ups
over the past 20years has shown
a 70-percent annual return,
which makes it a safe invest-

At the University's Board of
Regents meeting on Thursday,
Slottow will present the MINTS
program that proposes invest-
ing up to $500,000 - with the
potential of an additional $1
million - in University faculty
start-ups. He projectsthat there
will be an investment of about
$20 million to $30 million in
MINTS over the next 10 years,
or $3 million each year.
"It's good for faculty, and it's
good for the endowment," Slot-
tow said.
FACULTY DISCUSSES
RESOLUTION ON
PEACEFUL PROTEST
Later in the meeting, the Sen-
ate Assembly discussed a reso-
lution expressing the faculty's
solidarity with peaceful pro-
tests on college campuses, spe-
cifically at the University.
The resolution was drafted

in response to the recent events
at the University of California,
Davis and the University of
California, Berkeley that led to
police violence against peaceful
protesters, SACUA Chair Kate
Barald said.
"Not that there's any incident
here that led to this, and cer-
tainly, we hope that no incident
will have a need for this kind of
resolution," Barald said.
Despite unanimous support
for the resolution, the Senate
Assembly did not meet quo-
rum and therefore, could not
pass the resolution discussed at
the meeting. SACUA members
passed the resolution at their
meeting last week.
SENATE ASSEMBLY
DISCUSSES RESOLUTION
FOR REPORTING CRIMES
The Senate Assembly also
discussed a resolution that
expresses sympathy and sup-
port for the survivors of the
Pennsylvania State University
sex abuse scandal. The resolu-
tion cites potential causes, such
as inequities in power between
survivors and perpetrators and
among people reporting the
crime, as well as an underre-
porting of criminal behavior.
It also includes suggestions
for action that can prevent simi-
lar events from occurring at the
University, such as educating

$1,000 in value, Brown said the
suspect(s) could be sentenced
to no more than one year in
jail and charged with a fine of
no more than $2,000 or three
times the value of the property
stolen.
Brown said there has been a
yearly trend of December tree-
cuttings in the arboretum, but
detectives have had difficulty
solving the crimes.
"What I understand from
previous years (is that) they
typically are reported in the
month of December, and we
don't have a lot of success in
finding suspects," Brown said.
O'Dell said the tree was
donated by Ilene Forsyth, a
professor emeritus of history of
art, whose home shares a prop-
erty line with the arboretum.
He added that he thinks future
tree cuttings could be prevented
through additional DPS patrols
and a neighborhood watch in the
area bordering the arboretum.
There are plans to replace
the tree next season, according
to O'Dell.
the community and developing
training programs for faculty
and staff.
"The objective here was to try
to get information to people who
could act as early as possible in
the process because I think all
of us noted that the main issue
beyond the act and the lack of
reporting was the cover-up,"
Barald said.
Last month, former Penn
State football coach Jerry San-
dusky was charged with child
sex abuse. Former Penn State
head football coach Joe Paterno
and former Penn State President
Graham B. Spanier were dis-
missed from their positions, asa
result of the incident.

Earlier in the meeting, Slot-
tow mentioned that in Cole-
man's e-mail regarding the
Penn State scandal, which was
sent to all students and faculty
on Nov. 15, included was a link

'U' needs to address issues in FOIA Office
The Universitys administration's transparency with public
records has become a concern. Last Thursday, The Michi-
gan Daily exposed another flaw within the administrative
system, specifically with the University's FOIA Office. The Michi-
gan Freedom of Information Act is a state law that mandates pub-
lic bodies to release requested public information at a low or no
cost. The University is a public institution, so most of its records are
public records. But the University's FOIA Office has been recently
charging expensive fees for requestors to receive public records.
The University's inability to provide requested information in a
timely, reasonably priced manner is a failure on its part, and its pro-
cess needs to change.

In recent years, the Daily has uncovered
closed-door meetings held by the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents and administrators
trying to conceal certain decisions. Another
notable investigation was the discovery in
2009 of the University Department of Public
Safety Oversight Committees' failure to hold
proper elections. In the latest investigation,
a Daily article from Dec. 8 revealed that the
University FOIA Office does not function
the same way as other Big Ten School FOIA
offices. The Daily requested information on
the number of parking tickets given on cam-
pus and employees' purchasing cards trans-
actions from the University, as well as other
schools. While some schools gave the infor-
mation for free or a small charge, the Uni-
versity asked for more than $1,000 for each
request. m
The purpose of FOIA is to encourage
transparency among public institutions. If
an organization receives taxpayer money, the
public has the right to know how the orga-
nization is spending that money and how it
operates. A properly functioning FOIA Office
should make that process as easy and effi-
cient as possible.
The discrepancies in estimated costs to
fulfill open record requests between the Uni-
versity and comparable public institutions
show that the University is not meeting its
obligations under the Michigan open records

law. The failure may simply reflect an under-
staffed FOIA Office, or it could be a sign that
the University's records are unorganized. An
understaffed office should be given resourc-
es to hire new employees, and poorly main-
tained records should be made electronic and
more accessible for the benefit of the public.
More alarmingly, the FOIA Office could be
inflating request costs to discourage outside
scrutiny of the University. While that is an
unlikely scenario, without the FOIA Office
operating efficiently, it's impossible to have
complete transparency.
It's clear from other universities' quick
responses and low fees that the FOIA Office
at the University of Michigan is not operat-
ing properly. If it is as difficult to retrieve
charge card information as the FOIA Office
has claimed, then there is legitimate concern
of whether the University has a handle on
the more than $105 million employees spend
with charge cards each year. When records
are not easily accessible, there is an increased
risk of faculty misuse.
Regardless of the reason for the problems
with the FOIA Office, it's an unacceptable sit-
uation. If the office is disorganized or under-
staffed, the University needs to invest in
the FOIA Office to fix these problems. If the
charges are meant to discourage requests,
that violates the spirit and letter of the law
and should be immediately addressed.

presume that many of my fel-
low seniors can relate to the
feeling of not wanting to move
on. The spec-
ter of life after
college looms
large wherever
we look. For
me, leaving The
Michigan Daily
symbolizes the
myriad of chang-
es that lay ahead MATTHEW
in the next few GREEN
months. As you
may imagine,
writing for this paper has signifi-
cantly shaped my experience in col-
lege and I'm sad to see it go. It was
in the second or third week of my
freshman year that I first made my
way to Maynard Street to attend an
Editorial Board meeting. And in the
three and a half years since then, I
may not have been a fixture in the
newsroom as others have - but the
paper has defined me nevertheless.
It's hard to reflect on my tenure
at the Daily without immediately
thinking about all the people who've
hated my columns. Pessimism is in
my nature, so this may not come as
a surprise. Over the years I've main-
tained some loyal readers, of course
- here's a shout out to my girls at the
synagogue sisterhood - but I also
developed a colorfully diverse set of
detractors. And from this latter set,
I've heard a remarkably extensive
range of criticism.
In response e-mails and com-
ment pages, they've accused me of
being both a spoiled son of privilege
and a militant socialist bent on class
warfare. I've been called an agent
of Zionist propaganda as well as an
anti-Israel pawn of the Left. Many
have accused me of pushing a radi-
cal gay agenda. Yet just a few weeks
ago a printed viewpoint accused me
of projecting heteronormative ideas
onto others.
Hyperbolic to say the least, these

seemingly contradictory criticisms
highlight an important element of
my writing over the years.
As I've articulated my opinions,
I've at least attempted to look at
issues from multiple angles, even if
my work generally took one bias or
another. I mean, let's face it - this
was opinion writing. But from all
of the back and forth involved, it's
no wonder that my criticism would
be so varied. This, I think, was the
most valuable part of writing my
column: the chance to figure out
exactly what I believed. In some
ways it was dangerous to put into
writing opinions that may not stick
with me throughout my career. But
from the feedback I've received,
formally and casually, my opin-
ions and my logic were sharpened
immeasurably.
One criticism has been that I've
taken my writing too seriously.
Indeed, this is something I've heard
about the Daily more generally as
well. Musing on this, I think there
are two important truths here.
The first is that college news-
papers don't matter a whole lot.
Skeptical friends and critics are
often quite willing to point that out.
With the exception of some Univer-
sity news, college newspapers only
somewhat provide information that
other sources - other news outlets,
blogs or gossip, for instance - don't.
Articles are written and edited by
unseasoned journalists and opinion
writers are almost never experts on
the subjects they discuss. And in a
culture that's dominated by social
media, the college newspaper is no
longer the go-to medium for campus
communication.
But ina sense, the college newspa-
per is the only thing that does mat-
ter. For freshmen writers, the paper
can provide journalistic experience
to build upon. And for opinion writ-
ers, it's a springboard for formulating
ideas. Both these instances epitomize
the ways in which college is sup-

posed to benefit those who can go
- teaching both practical and theo-
retical skills. More important still is
the way in which the paper enhances
the University's ability to develop an
educated and thoughtfully critical
citizenry. Though it often plays sec-
ond fiddle to other pages - sports,
much to my chagrin - the opinion
page is the frontal lobe of the news-
paper. It contextualizes the stories
written in other sections, and it's
the sectionwith the greatest stake in
social justice. I often tried to remem-
ber this as I wrote my columns.
It's truly been an
honor to write
for the Daily.
And whether ornot Isucceeded in
imbuing a greater social awareness
in my writing, I can only hope that
my successors will continue trying
to do so.
In the past few years I've writ-
ten roughly 37,500 words in about
50 opinion articles. That's more or
less 130 pages of double-spaced,
elected, extra work. Though I could
surely continue finding material
within the news and in day-to-day
life, I've decided it's time to tuck
away my byline and give someone
else a pen.
I thank you for reading my work
over the past few years, for sharp-
ening my judgment and for keeping
me honest. You may have hated my
flaming liberalism or my occasion-
ally questionable outlook on life, but
this experience has been unparal-
leled for me. It's truly been an honor
to write for you.

COURTNEY MERCIER J

Student-athletes go green CONNOR CAPLIS AND BENNETT STEIN [

Student-athletes at the University are going
green! Well, not green as in our rivals to the
north, butgreen as in sustainable and environ-
mentally aware. Michigan Student-Athletes
for Sustainability, a group of student-athletes,
have organized an official career community
in M-PACT - a professional and career tran-
sition program for student-athletes. With
support from M-PACT and the Student Sus-
tainability Initiative, we are very optimistic
about the changes we can make in the Athletic
Department.
M-SAS's founder, Courtney Mercier, a four-
year varsity student-athlete, formed M-SAS
last year when she realized that there were
other student-athletes like her who were
interested in environmental sustainability
but didn't know how to get involved. Shortly
after the Athletic Department approved the
creation of M-SAS in September, University
President Mary Sue Coleman announced the
University's sustainability goals and commit-
ment for the entire University. Throughout
the University, departments and offices had
begun to embrace a culture of sustainability
even before the announcement.
However, as student-athletes, we have
noticed that this culture isn't infused into the
athletic community. When we go to our ath-
letic events, we wonder how a university that
has made such an incredible commitment to
sustainability could have such a sustainability
deficiency in its athletic facilities. The biggest
exposure thatthe University receives on a daily
basis is through its athletics program. When
fans come to our games, we want them to know

that as a university, we care about sustainabil-
ity. At Michigan, we strive to be the Leaders
and Best in everything, so shouldn't the athlet-
ics community also aim to be the Leaders and
Best in environmental sustainability?
Our goal for M-SAS is to be a program not
only for professional and career-related issues,
but also avenue for student-athletes to express
their interests and desires to make the athletic
community more environmentally sustain-
able. We hope to unify individual interests,
organize action and build awareness. We're
not just fighting to get recycling bins put in
the facilities, but rather we want to reach out
to all student-athletes, coaches, fans, everyone
in the athletic community. We want to educate
and empower them to make their own choices
about sustainability.
The commitment that the University has
made to sustainability has created an amazing
opportunity for us to integrate the sustain-
ability movement into the athletic commu-
nity. In order to do this, we need widespread
support from not only the Athletic Depart-
ment, but from everyone across campus. The
University's commitment would not be com-
plete without the involvement of the Athletic
Department. In an effort to create one culture
of sustainability at the University, we have
made our slogan for M-SAS: "We play on Plan-
et Blue," which complements the "We live on
Planet Blue" slogan conveyed throughout the
rest of campus.
Courtney Mercier is an LSA senior.
She is the founder of M-SAS.

Protect peaceful protests

The images from the University of California, Davis
are shocking. A row of people sit in solidarity with the
Occupy movement. Their arms are linked, and their
heads are bowed. Above them strolls a helmeted police
officer applying a heavy coat of pepper spray to their
heads and faces with the efficiency and seeming indiffer-
ence of a robotic arm in a paint shop. The video, show-
ing the extensive use of pepper spray against non-violent
protesters, immediately strikes as an inexplicable and
indefensible overreaction and abuse of power. On Nov.29,
University students held a vigil on the Diag in support of
UC-Davis and UC-Berkeley students. The use of pepper
spray on non-violent protesters is inhumane, unethical
and unconstitutional. The health of our democracy and
the vitality of the college campus as a haven for non-vio-
lent social protest rely on a police force that protects free
speech, not brutalizes it.
We are fortunate that the University has a deep and
proud history of non-violent protest, dating back to the
1960s anti-Vietnam War protests. Campus saw the rise
and fall of the Students for a Democratic Society's anti-
war leadership. The 1970's included the Black Action
Movement's campus-wide strike to protest low minority
enrollment. These protests and their legacy of student
activism have developed a community that stands firmly
behind the First Amendment in its respect for peaceful
protest. Our University community, however, must work
actively to not only preserve free speech but also expand
the right to those still silenced.
Though much of the non-violent protests at the Uni-
versity have been correctly tolerated, we cannot forget
the less-than-shining moments in our recent past. In
April 2007, the Department of Public Safety unneces-
sarily arrested 12 students who had staged a sit-in at the
Fleming Administration Building as part of a Students
Organizing for Labor and Economic Equality campaign.
In October 2010, the University attempted to charge
a security fee to the student group Students For Life to
pay for an unsolicited DPS presence to monitor protests
of their event. The University eventually revoked the fee,

as it is unconstitutional to financially burden a speaker
because of a potential hostile reaction to her speech.
These local examples as well as the news from around
the country show a growing need for action to prevent
the erosion of this critical liberty and further extend it
to all individuals.
In response to inquiries by the university's chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union, the University fur-
thered its protection of speech this year as it reviewed
and reformed its trespass policy. The new policy limits
DPS's discretion in banning individuals from campus and
ends the practice of lifetime bans without review. Addi-
tionally, this year the University stood proudly behind
History Prof. Juan Cole, as reports emerged that the
CIA had targeted him as a prominent critic of the Iraq
War and Middle East policy. University Provost Philip
Hanlon wrote in response to the insulting news, "Free
expression of views is essential to dynamic dialogue and
debate." The ACLU of Michigan sued the CIA demanding
that it turn over all documents relatingto professor Cole.
We seethe health and safety of our University and com-
munity threatened not by peaceful protesters, but by any
force that threatens this free exchange of ideas.
There is no doubt that the violence at UC-Davis
illustrates the challenge protests present to university
administrators, public safety departments and the larger
community. The University's protection of protest and
public safety requires preparedness, communication and
professionalism. The University's values and excellence
rely on DPS's continued commitment to these goals. We
call on our administration and our police force to main-
tain their respect for non-violent protest for any cause, at
any time. This is of unique importance as the University
selects a new DPS chief to uphold these principles. The
excessive police force at UC-Davis must remind our cam-
pus of the need to unceasingly demand free speech for all.

Stein is a Public Policy senior. They are members

The year in music

Some thoughts on the past

Music majors are sometimes discouraged from joining the Michigan Marching Band.

Where marching
band members go
after they graduate
By LUCY PERKINS
DailyArts Writer
Directly beneath the maize
'M' sewn on the left chest plate
of his Michigan Marching Band
uniform, a tattooed block 'M' is
inked on the left pectoral of TJ
Wolfgram, a senior in the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance.
The tattoo represents the best
experience he's had at the Univer-
sity.
"This is the best organization
in the country," Wolfgram said. "I
don't think there's another band
in the country that has the unique
character and quality that we do."
But despite the talent and pres-
tige of the MMB, many members
do not ultimately pursue musical
careers.Wolfgram, amusic educa-
tion major, is one exception to the
norm and said being in the MMB
was not only memorable but also
essential to the future career he's
planned as amusic teacher.
According to LSA senior and
MMB member Ross Federman,
music students are often discour-
aged from joining the Michigan
Marching Band. The enormous
time commitment along with
technical and physical demands
work against the classical train-
ing music majors receive.
"It's a huge time-suck," Wolf-
gram said. "If you're a music
major, when can you practice?
The music school kids just don't
have time and don't have energy
to commit."
The MMB gave Wolfgram the

opportunity to learn skills like
marching, writing and arranging
music and drills for the band. As a
fifth-year senior, Wolfgram wrote
this year's halftime show for the
Notre Dame game.
Though Wolfgram intended to
pursue music education since his
freshman year, others are inspired
by their membership in the MMB
to make music their career.
For David Tenerelli, march-
ing in the MMB inspired him to
transfer from the School of Engi-
neering to the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance to become a
band director.
"I had a god audition my first
year in MMB, and I kind of real-
ized that maybe I had to make this
something that I should do with
my life," Tenerelli said.
Now Tenerelli lives in Frisco,
Texas and is the director of the
Northern Dallas suburb's middle
school music program. He said he
teaches about 310 students.
"There's too much attrition
when it comes to young musicians
going through music programs
in schools today," Tenerelli said.
"Too many kids quit. That's some-
thingthat I hate to see."
Tenerelli uses his experi-
ence with the MMB to inspire
his students, showing videos of
marching bands performing and
simplifying old MMB arrange-
ments so his middle schoolers can
play them.
Some MMB members aspire
to be in a professional band, hop-
ing for the off-chance that they'll
make it big - some actually do.
When Federman joined the
MMB's drum line as a freshman
in 2003, he never thought he
would take six years off school
to tour with a successful band

throughout the country.
In 2004 the local band Tally
Hall needed a drummer, so
Federman auditioned. The group,
started out playing at the U Club
and fraternities, but within a
year was selling out shows at The
Blind Pig.
"One year turned into six and
we ended up in New York," Feder-
man said. "It was something I
thought I would just do for a year
but things took off in a way we
didn't expect."
Now back at the University,
Federman is still affiliated with
the MMB, playing drums with the
basketball band.
Regardless of whether music
is a career or a pastime, people
like Federman can't stay away
from the Michigan Marching
Band.
"You're a part of the team that
has so much school spirit behind
it," Federman said. "No other
music ensemble on campus starts
and ends each practice by playing
our school fight song - there's
just this feeling you get."
That unforgettable, infectious
feeling almost always guarantees
a lifetime of dedication to the
Michigan Marching Band.
"In the trombone section,
nobody gets taken off of our list-
serv," Wolfgram said. "We reply
to all on everything. Someone in
our section was at a bowl game
and an alum came up to him and
knew who this student was. That
trombone alum graduated in'91."
It's hard to pinpoint a tangible
reason that ties countless gen-
erations of horns, drum lines and
clarinets together.
"You can't ply apart the rea-
sons," Wolfgram said. "I don't
know where it comes from."

Lil B is perhaps the preemi-
nent rap artist of the Internet age.
We live his art
as a constant,
unfiltered
stream of
content. All
of the embar-
rassing apho-
risms, the
idiotic inside JOE
jokes - utter DIMUZIO
excess oppos-
ing Spartan
simplicity - the tension in his
music cannot be dismissed. On
his most successful album yet, Lil
B sounds indulgent, earnest and
celebratory, in a way few or no
rappers can emulate. It doesn't
hurt that he's working with the
best beat-maker in hip hop right
now. His charms are real, his
failures ample. I feel closer to him
than any rapper ever. Is this what
it means to be based?
Pure X, Pleasure
This record is a ritual. Drone
and heat-smeared bass, yelping
goblin vocals and that guitar!
I can't think of a more somber
instrument in 2011 than Nate
Grace's guitar on Pleasure. It's
supposed to have been recorded
live and you can feel it - all
flimsy cues and slippery notes,
the casual doom of the jammier
bits (sometimes I imagine the
band looking at each other's eyes
when they're not staring at their
shoes) give what is otherwise an
exercise in tone and pedal-play
some intimacy. And don't let that
title fool you!

minds behind
the similarly meaningless "Valen-
tine's Day."
And to think, almost two
years have passed since that
trainwreck of a film came out.
Everyone was already start-
ing to forget, to move on and to
remember director Garry Mar-
shall's ("Pretty Woman") better
years. Then, as if to reclaim his
status as a filmmaker dancing to
the whims of Hollywood execs,
Marshall churns out this mas-
terpiece.

To call this movie bad would
be a disservice to all the other
crappy movies that came out this
year. At least those other movies
didn't try to shove Nivea skin care
products down our throats at the
slightest opportunity. (Granted,
Nivea sells a large chunk of the
merchandise at Times Square
on New Year's Eve, but seriously,
when was the last time we saw
every single New Yorker sport-
ing that fashionable Nivea foam
hand and hat?) -
Dragging on for nearly two
hours, "New Year's Eve" boils
down to nothing more than a
tedious game of waiting out the
clock. The horrifying aspect is
seeing how badly the film can
shake your belief in the motion
picture industry over the course
of those two hours. For one,
there's no real believable plot to
tie the story together. Instead,
the writer (Katherine Fugate,
"Valentine's Day") slapped
together a paltry mash-up of idi-
otic little subplots involving 20
different New Yorkers as they

prep for the titular New Year's
Eve celebration.
In all honesty, the best way to
show the utter senselessness of
these stories is to describe the
most interesting ones. Zac Efron
("High School Musical") plays
a bike messenger trying to help
a boring, middle-aged woman
(Michelle Pfeiffer, "Hairspray")
fulfill all of her New Year's reso-
lutions - it really is as stupid as
it sounds - in exchange for tick-
ets to a party.
Save the bubbly
for next year.
Somehow, two-time Oscar
winners Hillary Swank ("Million
Dollar Baby") and Robert DeNiro
("Limitless") find themselves on
this waste of a movie set. Swank

NEW YEAR'S EVE
From Page 5

No 'Shelter' in atmospheric film

4

Jeff Nichols sets
doomsday tone in
surreal thriller
By ADITI MISHRA
DailyArts Writer
A storm is coming that will
wipe out mankind, so take shel-
ter. That's what Roland Emm-
erich would tell
us. In "Take
Shelter," direc-
tor Jeff Nichols Take Shelter
("Shotgun Sto-
ries") has other At the
plans. With Michigan
painful grace Sony Pictures
and execution' Classics
Nichols tells the
story of fam-
ily-man Curtis (Michael Shan-
non, "The Runaways"). There's a
storm brewing in Curtis's head,
and its black, oily thunderous
rain could decide either his fate
or ours. In a whirlwind of hal-
lucinations that obscure the
line between reality and delu-
sion, Nichols treats his audience
to what could just as easily be a
disaster movie as an agonizing
glimpse into the disintegrating
mind of a schizophrenic.

Curtis isn't an extraordinary
man. He's not rich, he's not good-
looking and he operates drills for
a living. But he's got one thing
going for him - he's normal. In
comparison to his drunk, wasted
friends, he's got his life sorted
out. Within the first few min-
utes of the film, one is moved by
his support and compassion for
his deaf daughter Hannah (new-
comer Tova Stewart) and wife
Samantha (Jessica Chastain,
"The Tree of Life").
Nichols uses the connection
between Curtis and the audience
to his advantage when the night-
mares start. With every passing
dream, Curtis encounters a storm
that sends him into a raging panic
in the middle of the night. And it
doesn't end when he wakes up.
Every night brings some new hor-
rors and every day Curtis breaks
just a little bit more. The man we
loved from the start fractures
before our eyes. All the while, the
audience doesn't know whether to
believe his premonitions or sym-
pathize with his mental condition.
Nichols's agenda is ambigu-
ous - "Take Shelter" shuffles
between apocalyptic forebod-
ing and the precarious state of
the human mind. Until the last
minute, it seems to be about the

the New Year's ball drop, and
DeNiro portrays a bedridden old
man whose final wish is to catch
a glimpse of Times Square at
those final magical moments of
the year.
Sometimes this vignette-
based narrative structure can
work. But in order for that to
happen, each little story must
be able to stand on its own and
bring something unique to the
table, so that the final product
appears as multi-player as what
we expect when we walk into
the theater. The idea is alot eas-
ier to imagine than to execute,
and this film proves why.
It doesn't help that every
character showcases the inno-
cence and naivet4 of a five-year-
old. The effect is touching when
it becomes the hallmark of a
single personality, but seeing it
on every other character makes
it seem overdone and foolish.
Seeing as this film was - in
heart and mind - a follow-up
to "Valentine's Day," there's
no reason to expect anything
other than a bunch of recog-
nizable movie stars paid to lure
in weary holiday shoppers. So
keep those $10 for a little bit of
extra Christmas shopping and
save yourself the heartache of
experiencing, firsthand, how
commercialism can warp our
film industry.

SONY PICTURESCLASSICS

Remember to secure your own mask before helping your child.

latter. Knowing Curtis's mother
was a paranoid schizophrenic,
it appears natural that Curtis is
headed in the same direction: But
this movie's abstruse end beats
"Inception" at its own game and
the ever-nagging guessing game
of whether Curtis was right
returns to square one.
If there's one storm that's sure-
ly coming, it's Michael Shannon.
Every flinch of his hand betrays
his solitary distress. As Cur-
tis, Shannon dances around the
emotions that overtake his bet-

ter judgment, knowing they're
delusions. It's excruciating to
watch him build the storm shel-
ter - the ever-persistent battle
between reality and his mind is
pitiful and solemn. And though
it would seem far-fetched to
expect another to match his per-
formance, Chastain does. As the
exasperated yet supportive wife,
she's a dream to watch.
Perhaps that's what makes
this film so extraordinary at
times. There are moments when
it slows to a disappointing degree

and Nichols uses some masterful
cinematography and wide scenes
of the storm to counter the pace.
But while all else is inconsistent,
the performances keep the film
flowing. Disaster movie or not,
Shannon's evident conflict and
internal storm are the driving
forces of "Take Shelter."
Disregarding the underlying
hints of imminent catastrophe,
"Take Shelter" is a phenomenal
ode to the fickle nature of the
human mind and how, like it or
not, all are at its disposal.

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson threw for more than 2.000 yards and ran
for more than 1,000 as he led Michigan to a 10-2 record.

As he has done all season, Hoke
made sure the spotlight was on his
seniors, as he laughed and joked
with them all night.
"Doing this at a couple other
schools where you had fifth-year
seniors, at San Diego State, I was
their third head coach," Hoke
said. "That's part of it, and you
understand it.
"There are some guys that this
place means an awful lot too - in
fact, all of them. They appreciate
what Michigan means and what it
has done for them."
AWARD WINNERS: Junior
quarterback Denard Robinson
was selected by his teammates
to receive the Bo Schembechler
Most Valuable Player award for
the second consecutive season.
"I think he means an awful
lot, but it was probably as close a
vote as I've ever seen," Hoke said.
"And what you tell is how they feel
about each other and what this
team has been all year long."
Molk was named the team's
Hugh H. Rader Jr. Memorial
Award winner as the team's top
offensive lineman, adding to his
already impressive trophy case.
Defensive linemen Martin, and
fifth-year seniors Ryan Van Ber-
gen and Will Heininger, took
home hardware too.
For the third-consecutive sea-

son, Martin won the Richard
Katcher Award for Michigan's top
defensive lineman. Heininger, an
Ann Arbor native, was given the
Dr. Arthur D. Robinson schol-
arship award for the team's top
senior scholar.
And Van Bergen shared the
Robert P. Ufer bequest with senior
tight end Kevin Koger. The honor
is bestowed upon the seniors who
demonstrate the most enthusiasm
and love for Michigan.
Redshirt junior Kenny Demens,
whose 86tackles led the team, was
given the Roger Zatkoff Award as
the Wolverines' top linebacker.
EVANS WON'T BE BACK:
Fifth-year senior Marell Evans is
not expected to play for Michigan
next season.
"Because of a twist of fate with
different transfers and things that
happened, Marell was not able to
play or be eligible," Hoke told the
crowd. "But what he did do every-
day on the scout team was, he did
a tremendous job of representing
our opponent and our opponent's
defense.
"I can't thank Marell enough
fur that because there would've
been a lot of guys that said, 'That's
it.' But this team means an awful
lot to him, and I'm very glad that
he made a decision to stick with
it."

Campbell and
Washington among
big bodies who
could emerge
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
For most of the season, Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke reminded
the media that his team only had
12 guaranteed opportunities to
show people what it could do. Ten
wins turned 12 games into 13.
As the coaching staff tries to
find the formula to surpass the
total next season, the Wolverines
will have 12 more opportunities.
They're not wasting any time
preparing for them.
With two-and-a-half weeks
until the Sugar Bowl, No. 12
Michigan started bowl practices
last Friday. The tentative sched-
ule has the Wolverines practic-
ing during weekends to "dodge"
preparation for finals. But with
so much time before the bowl,
the coaching staff will devote a
little more time to developing the
future.
"We'll, as a group, work on
fundamentals and technique
once we get back on the field,"
said Hoke in his Monday press
conference after the Ohio State
game. "You're doing a little bit
for everybody, but some of the
younger guys we'll give a couple
reps too and some stuff that we
maybe wouldn't (during a game
week)."
In particular, Hoke needs
to groom replacements on his
favorite unit, defensive line. The
departure of fifth-year seniors
Ryan Van Bergen and Will
Heininger, along with senior
Mike Martin leaves junior defen-
sive end Craig Roh as the lone
returning starter in the trenches
in 2012.
Martin finished ttird on the
team in tackles thisseason with
54. The backup defensive line-
men have registered just 44 tack-
les combined in their careers.
Hoke said he would treat the

beginning of bowl practice simi-
larly to fall camp, which should
lead to further improvement
for converted offensive lineman
Quinton Washington. Despite
only playing sparingly this sea-
son, the redshirt sophomore has
drawn the praise of his coaching
staff and teammates throughout
the season.
"That's the first guy that
popped into my head," Mar-
tin said of Washington when
asked about the younger players'
improvement. "It's is something
that not everyone gets to see obvi-
ously because he doesn't get a lot
of playing time, but he's made
huge strides. ... When he first got
here, he was a load to deal with
over there working hard with the
scout team and coach saw the
athleticism that he does have.
"Bringing his hands and feet
were huge for him. He struggled
with that and I've seen day and
night improvement from him."
Likely to join Washington as
heavy contributors on the line
for next season are junior Will
Campbell, who saw chunks of
playing time this season after
receiving a lot of hype in fall
.camp, and sophomore defensive
end Jibreel Black, who was also
a regular contributor. Hoke was
quick to praise Washington and
added a few more names that will
try to fill the giant gaps (literally)
left by the departing seniors.
"I like (Washington's) intensi-
ty about his work and his focus,"
Hoke said. "A kid named (fresh-
man) Keith Heitzman has shown
some things that you get excited
about. (Freshman) Chris Rock,
there's some things there that
he's doing well. (Redshirt fresh-
man) Richard Ash is a guy that
we've got to bring along."
The list isn't exactly full of rec-
ognizable faces, but according to
Martin, they soon will be.
"I have full faith that those
guys are going tobe able to reach
the expectations for tie position
to play defensive line at Michi-
gan," Martin said.
Martin, on the other hand, is
just thankful for one more oppor-
tunity.

Wolverines enter home stretch of non- conference slate

(7-2) now shifts its attention to the
Arkansas-Pine Bluffs and Alabama
A&Ms of the schedule.
The Wolverines' next three
opponents are a combined 7-12,
and with each of those games being
played at Crisler Arena, it would
be a massive letdown if Michigan
didn't head into conference play at
10-2 - a familiar record for a cer-
tain bowl-bound team in the Ath-
letic Department.
After the Wolverines host Brad-
ley on Dec. 22, they will set their
sights on the Big Ten season. The
conference, which had just three
teams ranked in the preseason top-
25, now has six ranked teams. No.
19 Illinois, which was expected to
rebuild this year, is 10-0 so far. And
No. 20 Indiana, which hadn't been
ranked since 2008, just knocked
off Kentucky - previously the No.
1 team.
"I think the league has sur-
prised people around the nation,"
said Illinois coach Bruce Weber
duringthe conference's teleconfer-
ence on Monday. "A good start for
us and for the whole Big Ten con-
ference. I've got to believe (the Big
Ten will) be RPI-wise No.1, unless
we really fall off these last couple
weeks of non-conference.

The Big Ten is indeed tops in
RPI at the moment. And its six
teams in the top-25 is tied for the
best in college basketball.
"I thought beforehand that we
were going to have a lot of sur-
prising teams," Weber said. "A
lot of the question marks that the
teams had and the conference
had, I think are starting to get
answered."
On Tuesday, Michigan will get
its first of three tuneups for Big
Ten play when it takes on Arkan-
sas-Pine Bluff. The low-revenue,
small-conference team has played
each of its games on the road and
won't play at home until Jan. 14.
Arkansas-Pine Bluff (1-5) has
struggled offensively and has
failed to top 60 points all season.
The Golden Lions have shot just38
percent from the field and average
52 points per game while allowing
68. Meanwhile, the Wolverines
put up a season-high 90 points on
Saturday on 57 percent shooting
from the floor and 54 percent
shooting behind the arc.
The Golden Lions' lone offen-
sive threat is senior guard Sava-
lace Townsend. The Mississippi
native has accounted for more
than one-third of Arkansas-Pine
Bluff's scoring and has tallied
nearly one-third of the team's
assists. Townsend likes to get to
the rim and is an excellent free
throw shooter, but he struggles
when forced to shoot the longer
jump shots.
Sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz will be important in
helping out to keep Townsend
out of the lane and forcing
the guard to snake jumpers.
Smotrycz broke out for 20 points
on 7-for-8 shooting and nine
rebounds. His 5.7 boards leads
the team - a welcome change
from last year when guard Zack
Novak led the team.
The Wolverines should be
licking their chops at the Golden
Lions' offensive inefficiency.
Arkansas-Pine Bluff commits

almost two turnovers per assist -
a staggering ratio that Michigan
will surely try to exploit.
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke could be the beneficiary
of some of those turnovers if the
Golden Lions' guard play gets
sloppy. Burke, who picked up his
second Big Ten Freshman of the
Week award on Monday, scored
20 points and notched his highest
field-goal percentage of the season,
nailing seven of 11 shots. He also
tied a career high with nine assists.
"He has performed, what I say,
is atypical of most freshmen," said
Michigan coach John Beilein. "For
him to be playing 30-35 minutes
a game and still playing at a high
level all 30 or 35 says a lot about his
personality, his desire to win and
be a good player - really become a
good Big Ten player.
"We're just continuing to give
him more and more and he's show-
ing no frustration about when he
makes mistakes, and he's allowing

himself to become a better player
because he's a great listener."
With the starting cast filling up
the stat sheet, Beilein will turn his
attention to the bench to figure out
roles entering Big Ten play.
The games in the next two

weeks will give Beilein a chance to
evaluate and decide who will see
the floor come Dec. 29 when Penn
State comes to Ann Arbor.
"We are still looking for what's
the best bench rotation. I think
that our starting five is pretty

solidified. You can count on (senior
guard) Stu Douglass coming off
the bench.
"We are looking for who's going
to give us something both offen-
sively, defensively at the seventh,
eighth and ninth spots."
