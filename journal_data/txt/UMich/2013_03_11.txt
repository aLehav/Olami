collapse
ANN ARBOR -
I t was always supposed to come down
to this: Michigan and Indiana for
the Big Ten championship. And what a
heartbreaker it was.
Trey Burke, always a step ahead, was
working in slow motion as he started the
ball up the court with 13.7 seconds on the
clock.
Burke had Cody Zeller beat with
the left hand, and
he nearly got to the
rim, but Zeller, fresh
off muscling in the
go-ahead basket on
the other end of the
court, got his tower-
ing7-footframethere
just in time. Burke
tried to correct, STEPHEN J.
looping a shot over NESBITT
Zeller's outstretched
arms. It bounced off
the far side of the rim and back out.
Jordan Morgan rose next, banking
a left-handed tip-back attempt off the
glass. The junior forward's shot met the
lip of the iron and rolled around a quar-
ter of the rim. Then, as fate tilted with it,
the ball rolled out.
Indiana 72, Michigan 71. The Hoo-
siers are outright Big Ten champions.

HEARTBREAK AT HOME

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Michigan falls
inches short of
Big Ten title

Morgan's putback,
Michigan's three missed
free throws seal loss
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
With a Big Ten title literally hanging
in the balance, a tip-in off the fingertips
of redshirt junior forward Jordan Mor-
gan rolled around the length of the rim
before finally dropping out of the cyl-
inder, leaving a previously undefeated
home team heartbroken on senior night.
Sophomore point guard Trey Burke,
likely playing in Ann Arbor for the final
time, drove right
at Indiana's Cody MICHIGAN 71
Zeller with just INDIANA 72
under 10 seconds
remaining. After his layup rimmed out,
Morgan's put-back had a little too much
on it, and Indiana grabbed possession
with just a few ticks left, sealing a Hoo-
sier victory, 72-71.
"I thought the ball went in," Burke
said of Morgan's miss. "It looked like it
went all the way down and then came
back up. We were unlucky."
Added Michigan coach John Beilein:
"I just thought for sure that baby was
going in."
After the Wolverines had grabbed a
four-point lead with 1:10 to play, Michi-

gan proceeded to miss three of its next
four free throws, allowing the Hoosiers
to close the gap and eventually take the
lead after Zeller made a layup with 13
seconds remaining.
With the win, Indiana won sole pos-
session of the Big Ten Championship - a
title that could've been split four ways
with a Michigan win.
The two top-10 teams battled until
the final horn, just as expected. After
Michigan (12-6 Big Ten, 25-6 overall)
controlled much of the opening half and
took a three-point lead into halftime, No.
2 Indiana opened the second half on a7-2
run. But neither team could put together
any significant run or even come close
to pulling away. The game saw a total of
eight lead changes, with seven coming in
the second stanza.
BattlingIndianaguardVictorOladipo
for National Player of the Year, Burke
finished with 20 points - 16 in the sec-
ond half - while Oladipo registered 14
points and 13 rebounds.
The Hoosiers dominated the battle
on the boards, though, 53-30, including
24 offensive rebounds. Zeller scored a
game-high 25 points, and pulled down
10 of those rebounds.
"Somebody always seemed to be miss-
ing someone," Beilein said of his team's
struggle to box out. "The rebounding
was a huge, huge part of this game. It's a
shame when we defend so well and then

Pair runs as

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
DailyStaffReporter
Another entrance into the
fray widens the race for Cen-
tral Student Government pres-
ident and vice president to four
duos, but the other three tick-
ets come from political par-
ties - youMICH, forUM and
momentUM.
LSA junior Scott Christopher,
the president of MPowered, and
LSA freshman Ethan Michaeli, a
CSG intern, announced Sunday
their bid for CSG president and
vice president as independent
candidates.
A relative newcomer to stu-
dent government, Christopher
became the inaugural chair of
the Entrepreneurship Commis-
sion when it was formed this
fall. He had been approached

by all three parties to discuss
entrepreneurship's role in CSG
next year, but said he wanted to
expand his role beyond entre-
preneurship while still main-
taining its mindset.
"Ethan and I both have the
entrepreneurial spirit ingrained
in us and the benefit of being an
entrepreneur is you get things
done very quickly," Christopher
said. "I think we've seen that
with (Parikh) this year - get-
ting a lot more done than people
thought he could as a student
body president."
Christopher and Michaeli
have numerous points of their
platform already worked out,
though they have yet to release
a formal version.
With University President
Mary Sue Coleman set to step
down in 2014, Christopher said
it's important that students'
opinions regarding the next
president are heard. He would
survey students on what quali-
ties they would like in a Uni-
versity president. Christopher
said he also supports having a

Levin is the longest serving
Michigan senator - he will

Levin said in a statement

Fire erupts at 'U' power plant

60 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(MARCH 12,1953)
The University's Board of
Governors of Residence Halls
hiked room and board rates for
the fall semester of 1953.
The Daily didn't disclose how
much the costs were raised,
but a board member said it was
"essentially just a question of
coping with increased prices."
The action marked the sec-
ond time in the past year that an
increase was voted on without
resident input.

The fire warranted a six-

Studies tie stress

Stress does bad things to the
heart. New studies have found
higher rates of cardiac problems

struggling through that country's
financial turmoil.
Disasters and prolonged stress
can raise "fight or flight" hor-
mones that affect blood pressure,
blood sugar and other things in
ways that make heart trouble
more likely, doctors say. They also
provoke anger and helplessness
and spur heart-harming behav-
iors like eating or drinking too
much.
"We're starting to connect

emotions with cardiovascu-
lar risk markers" and the new
research adds evidence of a link,

ologist at NYU Langone Medical

April election to
decide successor
to controversial
but beloved leader
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- Venezuelan opposition lead-
er Henrique Capriles is set to
announce he will run in elec-
tions to replace Hugo Chavez,
setting up a make-or-break
encounter against the dead
president's hand-picked succes-
sor, a close adviser to the candi-
date says.
"He will accept" the nomi-
nation, the adviser told The
Associated Press. He spoke Sun-
day on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized
to discuss the decision publicly
ahead of a formal announce-
ment scheduled for later in the
day.
Other opposition sources.
refused to comment, buta polit-
ical consultant at ORC Consul-
tores, which advises Capriles,
also said he would run.
"He will put himself for-
ward," said Oswaldo Ramirez.
"History is giving Capriles
Radonski an important role."
Venezuela's election com-

mission has set April 14 as the
date of the vote, 'with formal
campaigning to start just 12
days earlier. Ramirez said the
40-year-old opposition leader
would demand that officials
extend the campaign period
by moving up the start date by
more than a week, and that act-
ing president Nicolas Maduro
not be allowed to abuse state
resources to boost his chances
during the campaign.
Maduro has already
announced his intention to run
as the candidate of Chavez's
socialist party.' On Sunday he
picked up the support of Ven-
ezuela's small communist party
as well.
In a speech accepting the
party's nomination, Maduro
insisted he was running for
president out of loyalty to
Chavez, not vanity or personal
ambition, and called on the peo-
ple to support him
"I am not Chavez," Maduro
said, wearing a simple red shirt.
"In terms of intelligence, cha-
risma, historical force, or capac-
ity to lead ... But Iam a Chavista
and I live and die for him."
Capriles faced a stark choice
in deciding whether to compete
in the vote, which most analysts
say he is sure to lose amid a fren-

zy of sympathy and mourning
for the dead president.
Some say a second defeat for
Capriles just six months after
he lost last year's presidential
vote to Chavez could derail his
political career. If he waits, a
Chavista government led by
Nicolas Maduro, the acting
president, might prove inept
and give him a better shot
down the road. But staying on
the sidelines also would have
put his leadership of the oppo-
sition.
"If he says he doesn't want
to run I could totally under-
stand that," said David Smilde,
'an analyst with the U.S.-based
think tank the Washington
Office on Latin America. "He
is likely going to lose and if he.
loses this election he's prob-
ably going to be done."
On a personal Twitter
page that bore all the rah-rah
adornments of a campaign
site, Capriles wrote Saturday
afternoon: "I am analyzing
the declaration of the (elec-
toral commission setting the
date) and in the next hours I
will talk to the country about
my decision." A spokesman
said Capriles would make an
announcement in the early
evening.

Two.teens escape
after SUV crashes
into guard rail
WARREN, Ohio (AP) - A
sport utility vehicle carrying
eight teenagers crashed into a
guardrail Sunday morning and
flipped over into a swampy pond
in northeast Ohio, killing five
boys and a girl, while two other
boys escaped, the state highway
patrol said.
The Honda Passport veered
off the left side of a road; hit a
guardrail and overturned just
south of the city of Warren,
about 60 miles east of Cleveland,
Lt. Anne Ralston said. Investi-
gators say it came to rest upside
down in the swamp and sank
with five of the victims trapped
inside. A sixth who was thrown
from the SUV during the crash
was found under it when the
vehicle was taken out of the
water.
The, two survivors escaped
and ran to a nearby home to call
911, the highway patrol said.
Ralston didn't know where
the teens were headed when the
crash happened at about 7 a.m.
She didn't have any information
to release on possible causes
or factors in the crash, but the
highway patrol planned a news
conference for Sunday night.
"All Iknow is mybabyisgone,"
said Derrick Ray, who came to
the crash site after viewing his
15-year-old son Daylan's body
at the county morgue. He said
he knew that his son, a talented
football player who was look-
ing forward to playing in high
school, was out with friends, but
didn't know their plans.
A pile of blue, green and cop-
per-red stuffed bears grew ata
makeshift memorial at the crash
site along a two-lane road tight-
ly bordered with guardrails on
either side in an industrial area.
The sport utility vehicle had
sheared off tall cattails along
the guardrail.
There were also notes at the
memorial, including a letter
from Daylan Ray's 12-year-old
half-sister, Mariah Bryant, who
said she had learned they were
related only in the past year.
"It hurts, it really does,
because they are so young and;
like, they could have. had so
much more to life," she said.
"We just really started getting
close, and it's hard to believe
he's eone."

Two of the teens, both 15,
were brought to a hospital in full
cardiac arrest, St. Joseph Health
Center nursing supervisor Julie
Gill said, and were pronounced
dead there. She said they were
treated for hypothermic drown-
ing trauma, indicating they had
been submerged in cold water.
The two who survived,
18-year-old Brian Henry and
15-year-old Asher Lewis, both
of Warren, were treated for
bruising and other injuries and
released, she said.
Allthosekilledwere ages14to
19, authorities said. State police
identified them as 19-year-old
Alexis Cayson; Andrique Ben-
nett, 14; Brandon Murray, 17;
and Kirklan Behner, Ramone
White and Ray, all 15. The High-
way Patrol said Alexis was the
only female in the vehicle. It
wasn't clear who was driving.
Rickie Bowling,. 18, a friend
of Behner, sobbed at the crash
scene as she recalled his playful-
ness and reputation asa cut-up.
"He was one of a kind," she
said. "Everyone knew him in
the neighborhood. In school, he
always made everyone laugh."
Bowling said the tragedy
highlighted the importance of
savoring life. "Basically, enjoy
every second in life," she said.
"Enjoy life while you've got it
and while you're here and enjoy
people that you love."
She said she would rely on her
faith in the difficult days ahead.
"The only way to look at it is on
the bright side: he's in a better
place," she said.
Jasmine McClintock, 22, a
friend of a victim, visited the
crash scene and said it should
serve as a warning for parents
to be aware of their children's
activities.
"I hope it's an eye-opener for
parents," she said while watch-
ing the slow ripple of the pond
water littered with debris, some
apparently from the crash.
McClintock said she was
troubled by the question of what
the victims were doing out at
that hour, not knowing if they
had been out all night or left
home early.
"That's the part that boggles
my mind. It's like on a Sunday if
you're not going to church, what
are you doing at 7 a.m. out driv-
ing," she asked.
All eight were from Warren.
It's not believed that any of them
were closely related, the high-
wav natrol said.

NARAHA, Japan (AP) -
Two years after the triple
calamities of earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear disaster
ravaged Japan's northeastern
Pacific coast, debris containing
asbestos, lead, PCBs - and per-
haps most worrying - radioac-
tive waste due to the crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant looms as a threat for the
region.
So far, disposal of debris
from the disasters is turning
out to have been anything but
clean. Workers often lack-
ing property oversight, train-
ing or proper equipment have
dumped contaminated waste
with scant regard for regula-
tions or safety, as organized
crime has infiltrated the clean-
up process.
Researchers are only begin-
ning to analyze environmental
samples for potential health
implications from the various
toxins swirled in the petri dish
of the disaster zone - includ-
ing dioxins, benzene, cadmium
and organic waste-related,
said Shoji F. Nakayama of the
government-affiliated Nation-
al Institute for Environmental
Studies.
Apart from some inflam-
matory reactions to some
substances in the dust and
debris, the longer-term
health risks remain unclear,
he said.
The mountains of rubble
and piles of smashed cars and
scooters scattered along the
coast only hint at the scale of
the debris removed so far from
coastlines and river valleys
stripped bare by the tsunami.
To clear, sort and process the

rubble - and a vastly larger
amount of radiation-contam-
inated soil and other debris
near the nuclear plant in
Fukushima, the government
is relying on big construction
companies whose multi-layer
subcontracting systems are
infiltrated by criminal gangs,
or yakuza.
In January, police arrested
a senior member of Japan's
second-largest yakuza group,
Sumiyoshi Kai, on suspicion
of illegally dispatching three
contract workers to Date, a
city in Fukushima struggling
with relatively high radioac-
tive contamination, through
another construction company
and pocketing one-third of
their pay.
He told interrogators ' he
came up with the plot to "make
money out of clean-up proj-
ects" because the daily pay for
such government projects, at
15,000-17,000 yen ($160-$180),
was far higher than for other
construction jobs, said police
spokesman Hiraku Hasumi.
Gangsters have long been
involved in industrial waste
handling, and police say they
suspect gangsters are system-
atically targeting reconstruc-
tion projects, swindling money
from low-interest lending
schemes for disaster-hit resi-
dents and illegally mobilizing
construction and clean-up
workers.
Meanwhile, workers com-
plain of docked pay, unpaid
hazard allowances - which
should be 10,000 yen, or $110, a
day - and of inadequate safety
equipment and training for
handling the hazardous waste
they are clearing from towns,
shores and forests after melt-
downs of three nuclear plant
reactor cores at Fukushima
Dai-Ichi released radiation
into the surrounding air, soil

and ocean.
"We are only part of a
widespread problem," said
a 56-year-old cleanup work-
er, who asked to be identi-
fied only by his last name,
Nakamura, out of fear of
retaliation. "Everyone, from
bureaucrats to construction
giants to tattooed gangsters,
is trying to prey on decon-
tamination projects. And the
government is looking the
other way."
During a recent visit to
Naraha, a deserted town of
8,000 that is now a weedy no-
man's land within the 20-kilo-
meter (12-mile) restricted zone
around the crippled nuclear
plant, workers wearing regu-
lar work clothes and surgical
masks were scraping away top-
soil, chopping tree branches
and washing down roofs.
"They told me only how to
cut grass, but nothing about
radiation," said Munenori
Kagaya, 59, who worked in
the nearby town of Tomioka,
which is off-limits due to high
radiation.
Naraha's mayor, Yukiei Mat-
sumoto, said that early on, he
and other local officials were
worried over improper han-
dling of the 1.5 trillion yen ($16
billion) cleanup, but refrained
from raising the issue, until
public allegations of dozens
of instances of mishandling of
radioactive waste prompted an
investigation by the Environ-
ment Ministry, which is han-
dling decontamination of the
11 worst-affected towns and
villages.
"I want them to remind
them again what the cleanup
is for," Matsumoto said in an
interview. "Its purpose is to
improve the environment so
that people can safely return to
live here. It's not just to meet a
deadline and get it over with."

Emergency financial manager wrong decision for Detroit
n March 1, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder announced his
intentions to appoint an emergency financial manager for
Detroit as a last resort measure to address the city's grave
financial problems. Given the city's struggles with various problems
ranging from its depleted tax base to a crumbling infrastructure, it's
obvious that substantial changes must be made. That being said, all
potential solutions should have been considered before giving broad
powers to someone from outside the current city government. While
Detroit is in desperate need of repair, Snyder's decision to appoint an
emergency financial manager is a shortsighted move that subverts
the democracy of Detroit's institutions and residents.

After decades of decline,
Detroit, Flint and Pontiac
all experienced chronic
unemployment,
drops in aver-
age household
income and
plummeting
property val-
ues. The steadys
stream of people,
businesses and JAMES
government BRENNAN
investment
going to the
suburbs over urban areas in the
last 50 years has led to crises once
unimaginable in what were Michi-
gan's greatest cities. The failure
has become cyclical, as this loss
in money and increase in poverty
means more crime, worse schools,
fewer services and no funds to fight
these problems.
With Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der's announcement last week,
Detroit has become the latest city
designated to receive an emergen-
cy financial manager. Emergency
managers have one focus and one
focus only: budgets. Their sole task
is to take a municipality that is in
massive debt and to bring it into
solvency. In simpler terms, an emer-
gency manager's job is to balance
the budget and do so as quickly as
possible. The argument in favor of
such action is that cities in fiscal
crisis have displayed an inability to
manage their own finances over an
extended period and therefore need
the state to intervene.
However, failing cities aren't
experiencing fiscal crises simply
because they're mismanaged by
incompetent local officials. It's .not
a coincidence that Detroit, Flint and
Pontiac, Mich. are some of the state's
poorest areas and are hit hardest
by the state's struggling economy.
Fewer jobs, lower average income

and plummeting property values
resulting in less tax revenue are the
real causes of fiscal crises in cities.
A balanced budget would be nice,
but it won't stimulate the economy.
The state can raise fees and cut ser-
vices all it wants to save money and
eliminate deficits, but without a real
economic recovery, cities will just
continue their cycle of failure and
fall into debt later on.
When an economy is sputtering,
government - whether locat, state
or federal - must spend more money
and cut taxes in order to increase
growth. Spending directly gives
income to people and businesses,
whiletaxcuts allowforthose already
making money to spend and invest
in larger doses. Both of these actions
will result in heavier debt and defi-
cits short term, but the resulting
natural increases in employment,
income and investment will mean
higher tax revenues overall, and, in
the long term, a balanced budget.
Emergency financial managers go
directly against the interests of an
economic recovery. Austerity mea-
sures will only harm the economy
in the long run while improving
fiscal solvency in the short term.
Less spending means less income
for government workers or contrac-
tors, while increased taxes take
money out of consumers' pockets.
The reduced services and increased
taxes result in residents paying
more money and not getting much
in return. This makes no sense eco-
nomically and may contribute to
higher crime and lower standards of
living if money is taken away from
police or infrastructure funding -
the case in cities like Flint. ,
Detroit, Pontiac and Flint are
struggling right now. With less
money to attract business, improve
education and fund key services,
residents of these cities are losing
opportunities to succeed every day.

Detroit has been unable to effectively col-
lect revenue from its taxpayers. The constantly
decreasing population has only added to this
problem - a decade ago, there were over a mil-
lion residents; today about 700,000. The city
alsohas alonghistory ofinefficientgovernment
and officials misusing funds - notably former
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. State money will be
essential to funding programs that can turn the
city around. But bringing in someone with total
control over the finances is a step too far.
It may seem that bringing in an emergency
financial manager would be the quick fix to a
public sector plagued by more than $14 billion
in long-term liabilities. However, other cities
in Michigan, such as Allen Park, Pontiac and
Flint have emergency financial managers and
have shown little improvement. For example,
in 2002 Flint went into a financial emergency
and Ed Kurtz served as the manager until
2004. Kurtz left Flint in 2004, claiming it
was no longer in an emergency and that there
would be a $6.1 million budget surplus in
2005. However, the prosperity didn't last and
the city struggled with a deficit of $6.8 million
by 2008. Once again, Snyder appointed Kurtz
as Flint's emergency manager in 2012. The
Flint City Council has proposed to move away
from having an emergency financial manager
despite still facing huge deficits and a crum-
bling infrastructure. Detroit is much larger

than these cities, and it's unclear whether an
emergencymanager would prove effective in a
city - a serious gamble.
One of the bigger concerns of the emer-
gency financial manager is that it strips away
the autonomy of Detroit and gives power to
an official who most likely doesn't have the
same level of knowledge of the city as the citi-
zens of Detroit, who have first-hand accounts
of the changes that are needed. With this
change, the citizens will no longer have a
say in the way their city is governed. The
appointment of an emergency financial man-
ager was a short-term and desperate solution,
as exemplified by Flint. Going forward, who-
ever the appointed emergency financial man-
ager is must work closely with the mayor and
city council.
Without action, financial failure for Detroit
is imminent. Clearly, Snyder had to step in and
do something. However, his choice to appoint
an emergency financial manager hasn't been
met with complete praise, as evidenced by
Proposal 1 - in which giving expanded pow-
ers to an emergency manager was voted down
- and the recent controversy surrounding this
decision. In order for the emergency finan-
cial manager to have success in Detroit, they
must work closely with the people that know
Detroit best, instead of making rash decisions
that may harm thecity in the long run.

While government certainly isn't a
long-term job creator, public funding
for certain aspects of life is simply
non-negotiable. Schools need to pro-
vide students with an equal chance to
go to college or trade school and get
a job or start a business. Roads and
public transportation must be main-
tained and improved so that low-
income residents can get to work and
improve their standing in life, while
police need adequate funding and
staffing to help prevent crime and
improve a city's standard of living.
The people of
Detroit need
opportunities to
succeed.
No one is entitled to an easylife, to
a job or to money. But no one should
be condemned to a life of permanent
hardship and struggle. The people
of Detroit, Pontiac and Flint are no
different than anyone else. They're
no better and no worse. Given the
same opportunities as the rest of us,
residents of these struggling cities
would succeed all the same. Slash- *
ing budgets and increasing fees
and taxes will only harm already
disadvantaged people further. As a
state, we have to advocate for equal
opportunity for anyone, anywhere.
And in doing so, we must recognize
those of us who aren't giventhe same
chances. Opportunities for growth
and improvement won't be produced
by a balanced budget, but rather by
the hard work of committed people
when given the chance to succeed.

They're all the same."
That's OK. At the scale of the Uni-
versity, it's true that nearly everyone
involved with student government
wants the same thing: to make this
campus a better place for every stu-
dent. As cliche as it sounds, there's
a lot of weight to that statement.
Wherever there are politics, cyni-

essarily matter who you vote for.

tions and vote. Period.
All students have a say in this
matter. A majority of us will see the
campaigning on Facebook and the
chalking across the Diag. But hardly
a quarter of us will act on what we
see in two weeks, and an even small-
er proportion will care enough dur-
ing the rest of the year to see what
student government is up to.

We go to one of the greatest uni-
versities in the world, and we con-
tinue to produce some of the world's
most ambitious alumni every year.
CSG not only provides a powerful
platform for developing the skills
of those who are involved in it, but
it also seeks to nurture all students
on this campus and help them to
be safe and successful during their
time here and beyond. On March 27
or 28, I'll show that I care and will
cast my votes. Will you?

Porn's only part of the problem

If you keep up on all things Scandinavian -
as I'm sure you all do - then you're well aware
that Iceland's government is looking for a way
to ban Internet porn. Or, at least the violent
kind. Whatever that means.
There are already regulations in place that
limit the kind of sexual material that can be
distributed in print, but Ogmundur Jonasson,
Iceland's interior minister, has proposed that
those regulations be expanded to online porn.
In an interview with The Guardian, Halla
Gunnarsdottir, the political adviser to the
interior minister, seems to sum up the goal of
the minister's proposal:
"When a 12-year-old types 'porn' into
Google, he or she is not going to find photos of
naked women out on a country field, but very
hardcore and brutal violence."
Clearly, Gunnarsdottir doesn't think much
of her country's teens' collective ability to
search for Internet porn. Butlet's say Icelandic
12-year-olds actually type "porn" into Google
(which, by the way, is like going to Times
Square for a slice of pizza) to get their smut.
Want to see if Gunnarsdottir's claims are true?
Try for yourself - you'll see that what comes
up isn't exactly "hardcore and brutal vio-
lence," even with SafeSearch off. Now, what
do you get when you search for "hardcore and
brutal violence?" Something considerably less
sexy. And how are we going to deal with the
gray area that is hardcore porn that takes place
in a field? What then, Halla, what then?
But that's a conversation for another time.
The issue here, or at least the one I'd like to
point out, is that censoring the Internet as an
attempt to protect children is misguided. Any-
thing "bad" that happens online has a signifi-
cantly worse counterpart in the real world. On
the Internet, some people watch child porn.
That's bad. But in the real world, some people
make child porn. That's worse. Online, crimi-

nals steal innocent victims' personal infor-
mation and use that data to commit fraud. In
the real world, criminals steal personal infor-
mation and use that data to commit murder.
Worse yet, some people use the Internet to
illegally download music by the band Nickle-
back. Worst of all, some people are the band
Nickleback.
See what I mean? If you want to protect
your children, Iceland, teach them how to
cope with violence, both online and in the
real world. If the fear is that children will see
depictions of violent sex acts and then go on
to commit acts of sexual violence, then the
solution is to teach them not to commit acts
of sexual violence. Attempting to remove the
inspiration isn't enough. And if Iceland's gov-
ernment is simply worried that their little
angels will stumble onto objectionable Inter-
net content out of youthful innocence, then
these adults have a larger task than they orig-
inally thought. Have you seen the Internet
lately? It's disgusting!
In any democratic society, the debate over
what constitutes free expression is a healthy
one to have. However, Iceland isn't attempt-
ing to stifle expression, but merely consump-
tion. If the government really has a problem
with "hardcore and brutal violence" in por-
nography - that is, if it takes issue with the
mistreatment of women in under-regulated
adult entertainment industries - then it
should make attempts to protect actors from
unfair and unsafe working conditions. If,
however, Icelandic officials are just having a
hard time differentiating between depictions
of violence and actual violence itself, maybe
they should get offline and into the real
world. There's plenty of objectionable content
for them to grapple with out there.

March 27 and 28 are
specially marked on
my Google Calendar.
Although I'm
sure my Face-
book newsfeed
won't fail to
blow up with
constant pleas,
I want to mlake
sure I don't for-
get. Iknow I'll
see the creative HEMA
new hashtags E
for the occasion KARUNA-
as I scroll down KARAM
Twitter, but I
don't want to
somehow still miss it.
So what's the big deal with those
two dates? It's the Central Student
Government elections, and I have to
cast my votes.
Unfortunately, fewer than 20 per-
cent of you are likely to do the same.
I haven't been bribed by anyone to
support CSG; I'm completely unaf-
filiated with student government
in any way and just genuinely take
interest in its actions. Whenever this
is discussed, however, I'm met with
raised eyebrows. My friends involved
with CSG go out of their way to keep
me in the loopbecause too often their
efforts fall on deaf ears. After all, isn't
it weird that I actually care?
A few quick clicks through Wol-
verine Access tells me that $7.19 of
my tuition this term alone went to
CSG. That's the cost of a large pizza,
and, with more than 40,000 under-
graduate and graduate students at
the University, that adds up. This
money helps student organizations
to carry out their passions, it puts
on awesome events like pep rallies
before home football games and it
helps students get to the airport for
cheap through the airBus service.
But CSG is about more than just
the funding. In the past year alone,

members of CSG have aimed to make
our campus safer and more comfort-
able. Current CSG President Man-
ish Parikh has followed through on
one of his campaign promises for a
24-hour cafe, and now Bert's at the
Shapiro Undergraduate Library does
not shut down at any time between
Sunday morning and Thursday
night. Several representatives have
also played a key role in getting the
medical amnesty bill through the
Michigan legislature, indicating a
commitment to the safety of not only
students on this campus but all over
the state.
So, our student government lead-
ers make some pretty big things hap-
pen. Good for them, and let them
do their thing - right? It's not that
simple. American politics functions
on popular involvement and CSG is
no different. CSG is made up of an
executive board, commissions and
an assembly of representatives from
each school. But without student
body support, it's not always clear
whom exactly these representatives
represent. Involvement in campus
political organizations is often a
stepping-stone into future political
careers for many of these students.
Why not at least help them along
their goals while we can, especially if
it's as easy as reading a few platforms
and clicking a button?
Fine. CSG can be productive, and
the people involved in it are really
passionate. But what about all these
parties? forUM, momentUM, you-
MICH - it'll take a lot of time to fig-
ure out the platforms of each of them
before the election. Maybe we'll see
more parties pop up (with more cre-
ative plays on the University's name
to boot). Maybe, like last year, we'll
see an independent candidate push
to head CSG. And after all the cam-
paigning, research and propaganda,
many students may wind up at the
cynical conclusion: "There's no point.

smacked the midcourt stripe and

Moments later, Oladipo, with
tears spilling down his cheeks,
embraced Indiana coach Tom
Crean. After 18 games in the
toughest conferenceinthe NCAA,
the Hoosiers were the one team -
the only team - left standing.
Michigan, which could have
forced a potential four-way time
atop the Big Ten by toppling Indi-
ana,just couldn't finish. Unbeaten
all season at Crisler Center, the
Wolverines couldn't hold serve. A
five-point lead with the ball and
a minute left on the clock. Some-
how, that wasn't enough.
The free throws weren't free.
The breakaway foul was just a
foul. The trademark Burke step-
back jumper turned instead into
a drive and scoop over a 7-footer.
With everything at stake, the
Wolverines faltered. The rankings,
the budding Michigan-Indiana
rivalry, the tournament seeds, the
three Player of the Year candidates
on the court - each battle turned
toward Indiana when Morgan's
final put-back rolled off the rim.
Out of time. Out of second
chances. Out of luck.
It's hard to grasp perspective
right now. It's hard to appreci-
ate what exactly the Wolverines
accomplished this season. But,
if you take a mment (and try to
forget that loss to Penn State), it's
pretty astounding.

Christopher said he would
also like to start an internation-
al career that would seek out
companies willing to sponsor
temporary visas to allow highly
specialized foreign nationals to
stay in the United States after
graduation.
While youMICH called for
a 24-hour cafe on North Cam-
pus, Christopher said he would
rather address food quality.
Christopher also pointed out
that there was a 24-hour cafe
on North Campus several years
ago, but it closed down due to
low demand.
Christopher said he would like
to see some of the food carts in
Ann Arbor, such as the student-
owned cart Beat Box operate
on North Campus when Mark's
Carts closes in the winter.
Another issue requiring atten-
tion is cell phone service on
North Campus in buildings like
the Duderstadt Center, Christo-
pher said, and a solution would
be financially feasible.
In terms of campus safety,
Christopher said they would
like to add features to the cur-
rent University of Michigan
smart-phone app, including a
"blue-light" virtual panic button

that automatically alerts Univer-
sity Police and provides the exact
location of the student.
Christopher also said Coun-
seling and Psychological Ser-
vices is in need of serious
improvement.
"(CAPS is) very understaffed
right now and (we're) really trying .
to look at reforming that system."
Christopher added that stu-
dents need a more responsive
system that allows them to be
seen more quickly and more
often.
"I've heard of stories from
students at times where they
went into CAPS. At the end of
the counseling, they said, 'We
don't think you need another
appointment, you did a good job,
have a nice day,"' he said. "That
should be the student's deci-
Sion."
Possible solutions Christo-
pher suggested were an online
scheduling system and increas-
ing the number of staff working

teams. Burke is in contention for
both Big Ten and national player
of the year honors. Two freshmen
started, all five saw serious time,
and the seniors saw little to none.
It was far from a traditional Mich-
igan basketball team, but it was a
heck ofaregular season, wasn't it?

cops, the jerseys, the Fresh Five.
Butthat finishstillburns.Itstings
tenfoldmorefortheplayers,too.
But they, like every contender,
know that this is where the real
business begins. This Michigan
team was built to contend in the Big
Ten, and it did. And it was built to
contend inthe postseason. Wheth-
er it will? That's up tothe team.
If all five starters show up; if
Burke stays a step ahead, doesn't
waver; if Michigan can out-run
and out-effort and out-scheme, it's
going to be an exciting finish. It's
single elimination from here on
out, through the Big Ten Tourna-
ment and the NCAA Tournament.
Here's to the journey winding
down for a little longer than last
year, when Michigan collapsed
against middling Ohio in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.
As Oladipo dove across the
block 'M' and kissed the floor,
Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr. and
the rest of the roster slowly made
its way off the court. The arena,
which had students lined up out-
side the gates almost 24 hours
earlier, was silent.
It was heartbreak felt by all
12,693 in attendance. And that
heartbreak lingered on after the
seats emptied, the lights blinked
off, and the darkness enveloping
Ann Arbor closed down Crisler
for the season.
They won't be back, not this
year. But despite the sting of
defeat, there's still everything to
look forward to.

Michaeli identified smaller,
but more specific problems that
their administration would seek
to fix as well. Improvingthe qual-

ing better options for vegetarian

Michaeli said he also wants to
work with Maize Pages to make

with their interests at orienta-
tion to match them with poten-
tial student organization - into
their program, calling it a "good
start."
Lastly, Christopher said the
culture of CSG needs "more
open, more inviting and more
fun."
"I think at times, (CSG) can
be very political, which I don't
think serves the student best,"
he said.
Christopher said it takes three
years to change the culture of
any organization and Parikh
already completed that first year.
He added that he felt the current
administration was at odds with
the assembly more than is opti-

mal.
"I think the idea of political
parties can be a good thing," he
said. "I think how they mani-
fest themselves can be trouble-
some."
In particular, . Christopher
noted that under the new elec-
tion code, parties can spend more
money if they run more repre-
sentative candidates, which he
said is an incentive to run repre-
sentative candidates whether or
not they are fit for office.
"When you run as part of a
political party, you have two con-
stituencies, First is, of course,
the student. Second is the politi-
cal party," he said. "I see that as a
real disconnect."
In addition to Michaeli and
himself, Christopher said there
are three other students that
make up the core campaign
team, one of whom is Business
sophomore Peter Han, who
helped run Parikh's campaign
last year.

they just walk in and geta layup
(off an offensive rebound).
"That is a really talented Indi-
ana team. ... We still could've
won if just shore up some of
those areas."
Just as it did at home in early
February, Indiana jumped out
to a red-hot start against Michi-
gan. The Hoosiers (14-4, 26-5)
scored 10 of the game's first 13
points, thanks to two 3-pointers
from guard Jordan Hulls.
Indiana guard Yogi Fer-
rell made a layup at the 16:05
mark, giving the Hoosiers a
10-3 advantage at the, first offi-
cial timeout, but the Wolverines
stormed back, scoring the next
12 points in what would turn
into a 24-6 run.
Hardaway got Michigan roll-
ing with a highlight-reel block
on an attempted dunk by Ola-
dipo. The ball, which Hardaway
stuffed against the backboard,
found itself in Burke's hands.
Burke sent a pass ahead to Mor-

gan, who glided in for a dunk.
After freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III converted an
alley-oop layup, Stauskas scored
the next eight points, including
two 3-pointers.
The freshman carried Michi-
gan with 10 points in the first
half, after an unusually quiet
half from Burke that saw him
record as many points (four)
as turnovers. Robinson added
seven, but he and Stauskas both
went quiet in the second half,
combining for just eight points
in the latter stanza.
Burke admitted to trying to
"make some plays that weren't
necessarily there" in the first
half, and Beilein, without sin-
gling out anyone in particu-
lar, said several players let the
pregame buzz and the game's
implications get to them.
"I think there were several
times in the game where all
of our guys (were caught up
in the moment)," Beilein said.
"We've been there before, but
it's exciting.... We're playing for
a championship and you can get
excited. I wouldn't just say Trey

was the only one doing it - we
all did it."
Burke's only field goal of the
first half, a 3-pointer, put the
Wolverines ahead, 27-16, which
tied the Hoosiers' biggest defi-.
cit of the season. But Indiana
battled back, as its two stars
made their presence felt. Zeller
and Oladipo scored 11 of the
Hoosiers' next 14 points to bring
Indiana within three, 33-30, at
halftime.
Zeller led Indiana with nine
first-half points, while Oladipo
scored eight points to go along
with eight rebounds.
. A win would'vesecured Mich-
igan a No. 3 seed in next week-
end's BigTenTournament,which
would've meant a first-round bye,
but the Wolverines must now
playPennState on Thursday after
droppingto the No.5 seed.
"We told the team, 'I'd hate
to have that be a situation where
that's the end of your season,' "
Beilein said. "We do have some
time here ... (but) we have to get
quick rest and turnaround and
try and find some good out of
this particular loss."

SAWAS
From Page 1A
"Sava really wanted to do
something new and some-
thing different," Veining said.
"With Sava's there's a really
eclectic American bistro feel,
and Babo is a marketplace-
style grocery store with a lot
of fresh produce and a really
friendly atmosphere, so we
feel like this will be a nice
addition."
Veining said though the
lease was only signed about
a week and a half ago, Sava's
management has been whis-
pering about the idea for some
time.
"We knew that we want-
ed to do something, so we'd
been asking our friends and
regular customers about their
thoughts and what they'd like
to see," she said. "Sava loves
the community of Ann Arbor
and always works to give peo-
ple what they want, so we were
definitely interested in what
they had to say."
She said the plan for the
expansion will create an approx-
imately 6,500-square-foot res-
taurant with one area set up as
an espresso bar and the other
reserved for dining. Because the
former establishment already
included a functioning kitchen,
the renovations are not expect-
ed to be too dramatic.
Veining added that "authen-
ticity" would be paramount in
the creation and execution of
the new restaurant, which has
yet to be named.
"Being from Albania, Sava
really wanted to get back to her
' Mediterranean roots and pur-
sue something really unique,"
she said. "Several staff members
are currently planning a trip to
Spain so that we can study the
foods and flavors and culture
in order to make sure we're as
accurate as possible."


LEVIN
From Page 1A
reform tax loopholes and tax
avoidances to help decrease the
nation's budget deficit.
"Thirty of our most profit-
able companies paid no taxes
over a recent three-year period
although they had over-$150 bil-
lion in profits," Levin said. "Tax
avoidance schemes that have no
economic justification or pur-
pose other than to avoid pay-
ing taxes may be legal, but they
should not be."
The top Democrat on the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee,
Levin said he also wants to focus
on military readiness, maintain-
ing the growth in Michigan
manufacturing, and putting a

stop to using unreported money
to fund political campaigns.
"These issues will have an
enormous impact on the people of
Michiganandthenationforyears
to come, and we need to confront
them," Levin said. "I can think of
no better way to spend the next
two yearsthanto devote all of my
energy and attention to taking on
these challenges."
President Barack Obama
said the senator's presence will
be missed after these next two
years by the whole country, not
just Michigan.
"No one has worked harder to
bring manufacturing jobs back to
our shores, close unfair tax loop-
holes and ensure that everyone
plays by the same set of rules,"
Obama said in a statement.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder

also commended Levin's work
in Washington.
"(Levin) effectively brought
the needs and concerns of
Michiganders to the halls of the
Capitol," the governor said in a
statement. "His service on behalf
of Michigan and America is com-
mendable. On behalf of our entire
state, I applaud Sen. Levin for
his dedication and wish him a
healthy, fulfilling retirement."
U.S. Rep. John . Dingell
(D-Mich.)has served in Congress
since 1955, making him the lon-
gest serving congressman in U.S.
history. As a fellow Democrat,
Dingell said Levin's work ethic
will be missed in the state caucus.
"Carl is a giant, and he and his
service have been of enormous
value to the people of Michigan
and this nation," Dingell said.

Briarwood staff will communi-
cate with customers as much as
possible to ensure that they are
aware of any temporary incon-
veniences during construction.
People will be able to text a num-
ber to get construction informa-
tion such as bathroom closures.
Though Morris would not
disclose an exact cost for the
Briarwood renovation, he said it
would be "a multi-million dollar
project." Simon Property Group
is spending about $1 billion on
renovation projects over the
next few years at some of their
330 retail properties in North
America and Asia. He added
that, in recent years, it is more
common for shopping malls to
be improved upon rather than to
be newly constructed.

"I believe that the shopping
experience should be a very pos-
itive one," Murray said. "I think
that the customers deserve to
come in and see a fresh and
exciting shopping environment
- someplace where they want to
meet up with their friends."
Murray said the mall hopes to
welcome more national retailers
to put alongside their existing
retailers, including soon-to-open
Brighton Collectibles, Vera Brad-
ley and Michael Kors.
"We are pretty excited about
the prospects of what the shop-
ping center can become," Mur-
ray said. "We just want to make
sure that we're creating a fan-
tastic environment for our cus-
tomers, and we are goingto keep
doing things and improving
things to show people that we
want their business."

Students pick service over the beach

Alternative Spring
Breakers do good
in the U.S., abroad
By KAITLIN ZURDOSKY
For theDaily
Rather than leave the Mid-
western cold to lay out in
warmer climates, many stu-
dents-ventured outside the "tra-
ditional" spring break trip by
volunteering with community
service projects.
Several programs within
in the University sponsored
service trips across the globe.
University groups that planned
service trips including the Uni-
versity chapter of Young Life,
Muslim-Jewish Interfaith
Alternative Spring Break, Sa
Nima Collaborative, Human-
ity First, Alpha Epsilon Delta,
Multidisciplinary Organization
of Cerebral Studies, National
Society for Black Engineers,
Migrant and Immigrant Rights
Advocacy Medical Educational
Service Opportunities and BLI/
PILOT in addition to the main-
stay Alternative Spring Break
student group.
University departments and
clubs arranged trips to Chicago,
St. Louis, New Orleans, New
York, Texas, and other domes-

tic and international locations.
Some students worked in the
public-sector at government
agencies and cultural institu-
tions as well as non-profit orga-
nizations. Other groups helped
rebuild homes and buildings
destroyed by natural disasters
and provide support to people
in the area.
"The students are applying
what they are learning in the
class-room in a hands-on proj-
ect, often in environments that
are lacking in staff, resources,
and/or technology," said Kelly
Kowatch, who coordinates
trips for the School of Informa-
tion.
Students on Alternative
Spring Break trips agreed that
one of the most gratifying parts
of the trip was building rela-
tionships with other students
and people within the commu-
nities.
On a trip to Epworth Chil-
dren and Family Services in St.
Louis, LSA junior Alex Stinson
helped youths overcome severe
emotional and behavioral chal-
lenges. The St. Louis students
routinely combat problems
such as sexual abuse, domestic
violence and drug use in their
homes.
Stinson said he specifically
recalled one St. Louis student
who had an impact on him.

It might be counterintuitive to
write aboutthose Ann Arbor bars
that fly beneath the radar. Part of
their appeal lies in small crowds
and the feeling of being in on a
secret, but I also want to sip fancy
cocktails and call it research, so
let's go out for a nightcap.
Pushing through the
unmarked and unassuming red
doors at 301 Huron Street, you
enter a dimly lit saloon reminis-
cent of a 1920s speakeasy. The
Last Word is a dreamy tapestry
of dapper waitstaff, dark wood
paneling and erudite novels. The
latter are just bindings that have
been repurposed to hold lists of
fanciful cocktails. Some of the
novel ingredients include egg
whites, honey and orange peel.
Adam Lowenstein and Rob-
bie Schulz, two of the bar's four
owners, told me they didn't set
out to recreate the Prohibition
era. Instead, they wanted to take
the best of speakeasy style - the
cozy, intimate environment -
without going too far with the
kitsch. Accordingly, there's no
hidden door or secret password.
The owners said the bar's raison

This season, "The Walking
Dead" has been able to accom-
plish more than AMC could've
ever imagined. The show's ratings
have gone from great to down-
right unbelievable, and the series
has now emerged as television's
No. 1 drama in the coveted 18-49
demographic. Content-wise, it
also seemed as if "Dead" was on
stable footing after a shaky, and
somewhat controversial, second
season. Despite a stellar first eight
episodes, the ratings juggernaut
had begun to lose its way. While
this concern isn't yet on the radar
of most critics, I'm worried that in
the wake of Lori's death, the show
is starting to show signs that it will
suffer an even shakier future than A young Raylan Givens.

moral center and his friendship
with Glenn, as well as his compli-
cated paternal relationship with
Andrea, were key aspects of the
group dynamic. And as unlikeable
as Shane became toward the end
of his run, which ended in "Better
Angels," his character was essen-
tial to the relationship between
Rick and Lori.
No matter what you believe
to be the strongest part of "The
Walking Dead," you cannot argue
that a complicated group dynamic
is not central to the show's plot.
Without Lori, Dale or Shane, there
is nothing holding the characters
together anymore. If "The Walk-
ing Dead" had substituted some
of these deaths with more minor
characters like Carol or an earlier
T-Dog exit, the immediate effects
would've been lessened. However,
it would've benefited the show in

the long run.
The series has already strayed
far enough from the original com-
ics that saving some of these char-
acters may have been the right
move. In fact, if the writers had
followed the comics more closely,
Lori should have still been around
for a little while longer.
After a short, blink-and-miss-
it six-episode first season, "'ihe
Walking Dead" quickly made its
way onto my short list of great TV
dramas. And after a somewhat
rocky second season, the third has
provided some of the series' best
material. In the first three epi-
sodes back however, "The Walk-
ing Dead" has begun to experience
some growing pains. In the wake
of gigantic ratings, it's clear that
this show will be around for a
long time. I just hope that some
questionable decisions on the
part of the show's writers won't
extinguish this flame too soon.

and confused the hell out ofme. I
saw them in Detroit last summer,
but they were still an opening
band then. Now, as headliners,
it seemed as if the New Zealand-
ers had finally accepted the role
of "Rock Stars." I watched them
traipse to the stage in black
leather getups, and their show
was loud and prominent - cer-
tainly not "unknown."
The night after my Holland
excursion, I saw Australian
psychedelic band Tame Impa-
la perform at St. Andrew's in
Detroit. Seeing them onstage -
Kevin Parker, charismatic and
barefoot; Nick Allbrook, wiry-
haired and weird; and all the
other dudes - they really didn't
seem too different from any
picture or interview I've ever
seen them in. No, they looked
like they stepped right out of a
music video and into Detroit to
play a show.
The show, and the band, was
exactly how I expected them to
be (which reminds me - they
didn't play their song "Expecta-
tions!"). The show was almost
flawless - maybe a little shorter
than I would've liked, but aren't
they always? And, standing out-
side, among smokers with edgy
haircuts and high schoolers
waiting for their rides, I real-
ized I had a decision to make:
Do I wait and meet the band, or
do I go home with dignity and
respect for this band that just
put on a fucking fantastic show.
While I was standing out
there, someone pointed out that
in the second floor window of St.
Andrew's, a figure that appeared
to be Kevin Parker looked down
upon the dwindling crowd out-
side the venue. Wait - he was
literally looking down upon us.
He probably didn't really feel
like dealing with a bunch of fans
who felt like they had the right
to take a picture with him and
upload it onto Facebook and tell
them how "good" their music is.
I mean, what is he even supposed
to say to the thousandth fan that
tells him that Tame Impala is a
good band? "Yeah, I know?"
So, I went home without
meeting them. Musicians are
people too, and I'm getting too
old to be a fan-girl. Concerts are
still fun, though. The end.

originates from solid material
that the poor direction all but
squanders. Questions of feminin-
ity, spirituality, real and unreal
are buried underneath the simple
scares to which Gass-Donnelly
relegates the film. Producer Eli
Roth has made a reputation for
putting out horror flicks that
revitalize the genre. But what we
have here is another unwanted,
unneeded sequel, and an under-
whelming feature showcasing
unrealized ambition, potential
wasted.

Apart from another chance
to work with one of his favor-
ite directors, Franco explained
why, among a recent string of
serious portrayals, he decided to
do a more family-fun adventure
film.
"(The Oz books) were some of
the first that I read on my own
for pleasure. In addition, I saw
the role as something I could
have a lot of fun with and be fair-
ly creative," Franco explained.
"He was written as a comedic
character within a fantastical

world, and I found the combi-
nation fairly unusual. I thought
that juxtaposition of two differ-
ent things would result in some-
thingentertaining."
Franco revealed that his char-
acter isn't simply a male version
of innocent, little Dorothy, but
rather a con man, a charmer, an
adventurer, and even has some
tricks up his sleeve.
"I had to be able to carry
myself as a magician, because
my character, Oscar Diggs,
starts off as a traveling magician
in a circus and we even see a bit
of one of his shows," Franco said.
"So, they hired one of the best
magicians in Las Vegas, Lance
Burton, to come to Detroit, and

I was fortunate enough to have
private lessons with him."
Since a large portion of film-
ing took place in and around
Detroit, it was a sentimental
experience for Raimi, who grew
up in Royal Oak and attended
Michigan State University. So
emotional, in fact, that at the
mention of "The Michigan
Daily" during the conference
call, Raimi asserted his disdain
for Ann Arbor. It stretches far
beyond simply school rivalry.
"Every time I would drop a
girl at the University of Michi-
gan, she left the car with the
same line, 'Sam, I never want
to see you again.' So that city
brings tears to my eyes."

The dichotomy of
Michigan's senior day

Michigan manhandled on
the glass in loss to Indiana

t was senior day inside
Crisler Center on Sunday.
Five Wolverines strolled
onto the floor and were honored
for "being the building blocks of
the recent success of the Michi-
gan basketball program."
So Josh Bartelstein; Corey
Person, Eso Akunne, Blake
McLimans and Matt Vogrich
stood at
half court,
received
applause
from the
crowd and
returned to
their team-
mates.
This was EVERETT
all normal. COOK
Senior days
happen at
every program in the country.
The weird part was that the
seniors' moment, sentiment and
applause ended as soon as the
game started.
On Sunday, the dichotomy of
this Michigan team was in full
effect. The day started with a
ceremony featuring five seniors
and ended with two juniors, a
sophomore and two freshmen on
the floor watching Indiana cel-
ebrate an outright Big Ten title.
Not a single senior scored
against Indiana. Vogrich, in a
rare sighting, played five min-
utes - the most he's played since

December. McLimans, in an
even rarer sighting, played for
the first time since early Febru-
ary.
Before Sunday, the five Wol-
verine seniors were all starters
- on the scout team. They are
also the five players that average
the least amount of minutes per
game, and there are five fresh-
men that average more minutes
per game than these five seniors,
the men honored on Sunday.
This has been ateam carried
by underclassmen all season.
That's not new.
And by all accounts, Bartel-
stein, the captain, and Person,
the Wolverine named by the
younger players as the vocal
senior, are great leaders. They
always jump off the bench dur-
ing timeouts, are always coach-
ing from the sideline and seem to
have a good grasp of the lessons
taught by Michigan coach John
Beilein.
But Person and Bartelstein
have played 26 combined min-
utes this season. Bartelstein
hasn't scored a point, and Person
has just 11. They could be the
best leaders in the world, but it
doesn't mean as much when they
never see the floor. Person is
vocal, but if he isn't on the court,
how much can he really teach
Michigan's young core?
In terms of in-game experi-
ence, what can those two guys,

and the rest of the seniors, bring
to Michigan's underclassmen?
There are some games when
it's clear this team is lacking an
experienced senior leader, a true
veteran who has been there -
playing - in tough situations.
With less than a minute left
against the Hoosiers, Michigan
was up four and got fouled.
Three missed free throws
later, Indiana claimed the lead
for good. Freshman forward
Glenn Robinson III, junior for-
ward Tim Hardaway Jr. and
sophomore point guard Trey
Burke all went to the line, and
given an opportunityto seal the
game, all three of them whiffed.
Would having a senior on
the floor, someone who had
made big shots in the past, have
helped? Who knows. Impossible
to predict.
But who's to say that some-
one who had been there before,
someone with multiple years of
experience playing in big situa-
tions, wouldn't have been able to
help calm Michigan down when
it fell apart at Michigan State
- an insane environment - in
February?
Who's to say that Michigan
couldn't have used that experi-
enced senior leader on the road
at Penn State, when they lost to
a vastly inferior Nittany Lion
team?

After win over
Indiana, Michigan
bounced in
quarterfinals of Big
Ten Tournament
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill.
- The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team may have ended its
12-game losing streak to Michi-
gan State earlier in the season at
Crisler Center, but a new win-
ning streak for the Spartans
started Friday night as the Wol-
verines fell 62-46 to Michigan
State in this transported in-state
rivalry showdown.
Making its fourth consecu-
tive appearance in the quarterfi-
nals of the Big Ten Tournament,
Michigan (9-7 Big Ten, 21-10
overall) hoped to advance to its
first semifinals since 2001, but
the play of Spartan guard Klaris-
sa Bell and 14-0 second half scor-
ing run was too much for the it
to overcome in this wire-to-wire
victory by Michigan State.
"I think they just attacked
us defensively," said senior for-
ward Rachel Sheffer. "We really
couldn't come together defen-
sively, and we' couldn't carry
over with defensive stops to our
offense and nothing really was
going for us tonight."
Though the student cheering
sections were absent - the Mer-
chant Maniacs and Maize Rage
were not present - older alumni
for each school were. Positioned
behind each teams' bench, the
fans tried to emulate as raucous
of a crowd that was present
for their prior two matchups,
despite the attendance being far
less than before.
The volume favored the Spar-
tans (10-6, 23-7) to start, as Bell
sprinted down court on a fast
break to lay in a basket to begin
the scoring. She would score on
the their next possession as well,
and finish with 12 points in the
first half and 20 in the game to
lead the team.
"I thought Bell's offense
was unbelievable tonight," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "And her defense was
great, too. But she came out of
the gates and hurt us offensively.
I think she might have had their
first 10 points. So we expected
her to do a great job defensively.
She did a really good job defen-
sively against Kate the last cou-
ple of times, but I thought she
really stepped up her game on
the offense tonight as well. She's
a good player."
Unlike Thursday night's
matchup for the Wolverines,
their offensive production was
lackluster against the confer-
ence's best defensive squad to
begin the game, falling down by
as much as 12in the first half.
Michigan State doubled up
Michigan, 24-12, following a
jumper by senior guard Jasmine
Thomas after an over the back
violation on the Spartans was
reversed and they retained pos-
session.
While the Wolverines

remained visibly upset by the
call, they countered with a
3-pointer by Sheffer to trim the
lead back to nine. Sheffer would
finish with 10 points.
She added another basket less
than two minutes later to cut
the lead to eight. It appeared
Michigan might have shifted the
momentum back.
And it seemingly did, as
Michigan continued to trim
away, going on a 13-6 run, end-
ing on a senior guard Jenny
Ryan 3-pointer with 37 seconds
left to make the halftime score
30-25, in favor of the Spartans.

tory as they went nearlyten min-
utes without a ,field goal from

points on free throws.
Bell among others was the
reason behind this defensive
stand,limitingThompsonto 3-14
shooting from the field and 1-for-

"(It was) a little bit differ-

Senior forward Rachel Sheffer had 10 points and two blocks in the loss.

the field in the half, it remained
close.
Though the Wolverines start-
ed off poorly, they remained
within striking distance thanks
to Sheffer's seven first-half
points and senior forwards Kate
Thompson and Nya Jordan's
four points each, as well as soph-
omore guard Nicole Elmblad's
four points.
Similar to its game the night
before, Thompson was held
without a 3-pointer in the first
half, but unlike against Indiana,
she did not open the second half
with one, as Michigan turned
the ball over on a five-second
violation on its first possession
and a shot clock violation on its
second possession.
In return, Michigan State
scored consecutive baskets to
push their lead to the cusp of
double digits at nine points.
But before, they could push
it into that territory again, the
Wolverines went on an 8-2 scor-
ing burst to come within strik-
ing distance at 36-33 and make
it seem this game was far from
over.
But again, Michigan could
not close the gap any closer, as
sophomore guard Kiana John-
son scored seven straight points
for the Spartans as they went
on a emotion draining 14-0 run
to bring the Spartans' lead to a
then-game-high 17 points.
Unlike in the middle game
between these two, there would
be no second-half run by the
Wolverines to pull out the vic-

behind (Thompson), and she can
really do some damage. So I was
very pleased with her tenacity.
It's not an easy thing to guard
someone that gets flared, double
staggered, screened, rescreened
for 40 straight minutes."
Michigan's chance to win had
disappeared, just as what had
happened in these two teams'
matchup in East Lansing earlier
in the year, when Michigan State
opened on a 9-0 run to push a
seven-point halftime lead to 16.
Needing a run of their own
more than ever, it never came
for the Wolverines, as they got
within 13 points but never any
closer. Shooting just 28 percent
from the field in the second
half, compared to 54 percent
for the Spartans, doomed them.
While Jordan had a team-high
12 points and seven rebounds,
it wasn't enough, as Michigan
lacked another scorer with more
than 10 points, while Michigan
State boasted three.
As the Wolverine section
of fans dissipated as the clock
ran down, the Spartan fans
remained, loud, cheering their
team to the final seconds of the
game chanting "Go Green! Go
White!"
Both groups of fans knew one
of these teams would be going
back to Michigan after tonight
and for the other, a matchup
with top-seeded No. 8 Penn
State awaited.
In the end, it was Michigan
State that earned that date in the
Big Ten Tournament semifinals.

Though the Wolverines held
the Hoosiers to a 35-percent clip
from the floor, Indiana kept the
game within striking distance at
halftime by crashing the glass.
Michigan had an 11-point lead
late in the first half, but putbacks

out.
It helped a little that North-
ern Michigan was hurting
offensively after losing its
top scorer to a broken leg last
week (before this weekend, the
Wildcats had gone 1-5-1 with-
out senior Matt Thurber), but
that's no excuse. You can bet
that whomever Michigan faces
in the subsequent rounds of the
playoffs won't be relying on one
single playmaker - every skater
on the ice will pose a threat.
At last, the Wolverines were
cognizant of their shortcomings

on Friday night. And whether
it's the do-or-die playoff men-
tality or the fact that Michigan
is finally (dare I say it?) a decent
team now, the Wolverines have
gotten to the point where they
can take a close game like Fri-
day's and transform that into a
blowout the next night.

And while the Wolverines
scored as many goals with an
extra man as the Wildcats scored
the entire series, the strong per-
formance was more important for
gaining momentum.
Just 1:39 into the game on
Saturday, sophomore forward
Andrew Sinelli went to the box
for hooking and left Michigan at
an early disadvantage. But the

Michigan took a 0.200 lead

ing the second highestbars total in
program history.
"It was great because when we
went over to finish up on bars,
UCLA was coming into floor,
which we know is their best
event," Plocki said. "We only had
a two-tenths lead so we knew we
had to hit bars really well and
that's exactly what we did."
Miele performed in the leadoff
position and scored a 9.300 after
falling on her Tkatchev release
move. But, her teammates per-
formed exceptionally well and her
score wasn't needed. Sugiyama
won the event with a career-best
9.950.
"I just knew I had to put up

"She had a rough time but we have

In a four-way tie for second,
UCLA senior Monique de la To-re,
Zurales, Martinez and Sampson
each scored a 9.925, and junior
Shelby Gies contributed a 9.850.
"If somebody makes a mistake
before them, it does not have any
impact whatsoever on their abil-
ity to go out there and perform,"
Plocki said:"They overcame a fall
and hit five awesome bar routines,
which shows just how resilient
and tough this group of athletes
is."
If the Wolverines qualify for
nationals, they will have the
opportunity to return to Pauley

The second half followed suit.
Zeller had two consecutive offen-
sive boards, leading to six of his 25
points within the first two min-
utes of the stanza, and for the rest
of the half, the preseason Player of
the Year kept finding ways around
weak box-outs to crash the glass.
And though Michigan had
every opportunity to pull away in
the final five minutes of the game,
every sophomore guard Trey
Burke floater or redshirt junior
forward JordanMorganlayupwas
answered by the Hoosiers with a
putback by Oladipo or Zeller.
Zeller easily outmatched Mich-
igan's post players for most of the
game, and Indiana took advantage
of that, continually feeding Zeller
the ball. Morgan, an undersized
forward, had the most success
defensively, but Zeller still pulled
down 10 rebounds.
Freshman Mitch McGary was
more of a size match for Zeller, but

early foul trouble in both halves
forced him to sit for most of the
game. Redshirt sophomore Jon
Horford and redshirt freshman
Max Bielfeldt, the third and fourth
bigs off the bench, weren't able to
handle a physical Zeller, either.
But it wasn't just Zeller domi-
nating the glass. Oladipo had two
consecutive, easy layups for four
points that shifted the momentum
back in Indiana's favor with two
minutes to go, and Zeller added
another two points off an offen-
sive board to cut Michigan's lead
to a manageable three points with
38 seconds to go - a lead that ulti-
mately disappeared thanks to a
key offensive rebound by Indiana
and missed free throws by the
Wolverines to seal the victory for
the Hoosiers.
"Part of the rebounds come off
penetration," Beilein said. "Two
guys have to help the ball, so if
there's two guys, somebody's

going to be open. To find that
guy is difficult, it takes time, and
sometimes you can't even do it."
And Michigan hasn't been a
great offensive rebounding team
this season, either. With under-
sized and inexperienced post play-
ers, the Wolverines don't have the
personnel to match up against the
Big Ten's stronger interior players.
In many of its losses, rebounding
has been a main factor for Michi-
gan, but Burke believes the Wol-
verines will improve before the
Big Ten and NCAA Tournaments.
"(We have to) just keep going at
it," he said. "Just keep working at
it in practice, do rebounding drills
and things like that, send more to
the glass. It's something we try to
get better at. I think we've got-
ten better at it. Indiana's a good
rebounding team and they send a
lot of players to the glass."


for us to show that when we
bear down and want to win
_ a game, we can," said junior
defenseman Mac Bennett. "For
us to go out this game and com-
pletely bury them, that feels
really good, and I think that
will definitely transfer over to
next weekend."
If Michigan makes it to Joe
Louis Arena for the CCHA
semifinals (even though that's
still far down the road right
now) it won't have the best-of-
three series as a crutch.
The Wolverines won't be
sitting in the locker room on a
Friday night after a narrow win
or a loss, thinking about wlat
they can do to completely bury
the hatchet in the next game -
at that point, it might already
be too late.
Michigan is running out of
second chances. And the fact
that it learned its lesson this
weekend is the real highlight of
the series.

SWEEP
From Page 4B
When these two teams met
earlier in the year, Michigan ral-
lied for three goals during the
first game's third period to tie up
the game and ultimately win in a
shootout.
That wouldn't be the case
again though, as junior forward
Luke Moffatt's goal less than
three minutes into the third
period gave the Wolverines a
dominant 5-1 lead and all but
eliminated Northern Michigan
from the game.
After another penalty shot
was called with under ten min-
utes remaining, Copp buried it
home through Coreau's five hole,
making the score 6-1. Northern
Michigan got a goal late in the
game, but it was too little too
late.
The special teams, which were
exceptional on Friday, played
with a similar vigor on Saturday
night.
The power-play unit followed

up Friday's impressive two-for-
three performance with two
more power-play goals on Sat-
urday.
Though the penalty killers
didn't tally a short-handed goal
like on Friday - one of senior
Kevin Lynch's two goals - they
did hold Northern Michigan's
power play scoreless yet again.
"I think that was the best
game we've played all year. We
started hot, finished hot, and
we were great all around," Ben-.
nett said. "I thought our special
teams played really well. We
dominated the game, and we
knew kind of beforehand that
we wanted to stick the dagger
in (Northern Michigan) and we
did."
Michigan will be back in
action next weekend, traveling
to Western Michigan for the sec-
ond round of the CCHA plavoffs.

SENIOR DAY
From Page 1B
And who's to say the outcome
on Sunday would've been differ-
ent with someone on the court
who was honored in Crisler
before the game?
The hard part is that leader-
ship isn't something you can
teach. Certain people have it,
certain people don't, and for
some, it's something that devele-
ops over time.
Last year's senior leader was
Zach Novak, who's probably
been a natural, vocal leader since
he started playing organized
. sports. He was in your face,
aggressive and loud - it was
very clear who was the heart and
soul of the team.
This year, the de-facto leaders
were supposed tobe Hardaway
and Burke. They are the two best
players,therefore, they should
be the team's leaders, right?
It's not that easy. When asked
after the game how he was plan-
ning on helpingthe team forget
about the loss and move onto
the Big Ten Tournament, Hard-
away didn't have an answer. He ,
couldn't think of anything.

Novak would have had an
answer.
People forget that Burke is
just a sophomore. He's 20 years
old. He's not Novak yet, not
someone who will get in people's
faces and challenge them to rise
to the challenge.
This isn't to say the two are
bad leaders - it's just not a
strong suit; it doesn't come as
naturally. Maybe that skill devel-
ops by the time Burke and Hard-
away are seniors - if they stay at
Michigan that long - but right
now, it's just not there.
When Michigan is playing in
the Big Ten Tournament next
week, or the NCAA Tournament
the week after that, look at who's
stepping up and challenging
guys during timeouts. See who
looks in control during moments
of peril.
It's impossible to judge how
much different the makeup of
this team would be with a true
senior leader on the floor, but on
Sunday, it was very clear Michi-
gan needed someone whose
recognition didn't end before the
game started.

and then cleared the puck after
rebounds to kill the penalty.
And 30 seconds after the pen-
alty ended, sophomore forward
Alex Guptill scored to give, his
team the early lead.
The special-teams unit embod-
ies a larger part of Michigan's
improved play: the increased
effort put forth and better looks
at net.
Senior forward Kevin Lynch's
shorthanded goal on Friday night
came after he played up the ice
instead of waiting back. Lynch
grabbed a turnover near the blue
line and took the puck to the net
where he gave himself a clear
look.
But the special teams don't

require something special at
practice. Instead of waiting for
the perfect chance at the net, the.
Wolverines are swinging freely at
the net.
"We talked about simplicity
over the last couple weeks and
getting pucks to the net and get-
ting guys to the front of the net,"
Copp said. "Speaking for myself,
my goal was a rebound goal,
(Kevin) Lynch's goal last night
was a rebound goal, so simplicity
is really what we've been focused
on.
Ultimately, Michigan's special
teams will only be special if they
are good enough to create wins.
Six straight wins at the perfect
time qualifies as special.

Michigan, Michigan hockey coach
Red Berenson said that it would
be important for the Wolverines
to get off to fast starts and to use
the Yost Ice Arena crowd to their
advantage.

After Saturday night's 6-2 vic-
tory, mission accomplished.
Michigan (11-15-3 CCHA,14-18-
3 overall) used two high scoring
first periods to sweep the Wild-
cats (9-16-4, 15-18-4) and advance
to the second round of the CCHA
Tournament. During Friday
night's 3-2 victory, all three goals
came in a flurry of scoring during
the first period, and the Wolver-
ines used two quick goals on Sat-
urday to take a lead they wouldn't
relinquish.
"The first five minutes of the
game was huge because that team
was going to come out and try to
show that they could bounce back
and show that they can outplay
us and do what they have to do to

win here," Berenson said. "This
was their game, and I thought our
team came out and really played
hard and didn'tlet them play well."
Less than two minutes into
the game, sophomore forward
Andrew Sinelli took the games
first penalty, but having success-
fully killed it, sophomore forward
Alex Guptill forced the puck past
Northern Michigan goaltender
Jared Coreau to give the Wolver-
ines a 1-0 lead.
Michigan dominated the game
early on Friday night, and the
Guptill goal gave Saturday's game
a similar feeling. Wildcat head
coach Walt Kyle took a timeout'
immediately following the goal in
what appeared to be an attempt to

stop the flood gates from opening
again.
But Michigan would get on
the board again when freshman
defenseman Jacob Trouba fired
a slap shot from just inside the
blue line. This gave the Wolver-
ines a two-goal lead and all of
the game's momentum. With 29
seconds left remaining in the first
period, Northern Michigan got on
the board after freshman goalie
Steve Racine allowed a rebound
to bounce directly to a Wildcat
player in front of the net, making
the score 2-1.
Despite the game being just
a one-goal game after the first
20 minutes, Michigan tallied an
impressive 23 shots, compared to

just six from Northern Michigan.
This was a day after the Wildcats
notched just five shots in the first
period. The Wolverines would fin-
ish the game with 50 shots, com-
pared to just 20 from Northern
Michigan.
"When you have the puck in
their zone, they're likely not going
to finish with many shots," said
junior defenseman Mac Bennett.
"And that happened. You're going'
to win a game if you have 50 shots,
and the less shots Steve had to see
the better."
The second period started out
slow, with neither teams necessar-
ily gaining the momentum,but the
Wolverines struck again six min-
utes into the period on a Bennett

power-play goal. It was his sixth
goal of the season, and put Michi-
gan back up by two goals.
A minute and a half later, after a
strange series of events that ended
with Coreau out of the net and
three Wildcats sprawled across
the crease in an attempt to stop
the puck from scoring, the refer-
ees called a penalty shot. Senior
forward A.J. Treais was called
upon by Berenson to take the shot,
but Coreau made a nice glove save.
The failed penalty shot attempt
wouldn't end the period's action
though, as freshman Andrew
Copp scored with 2:35 left in the
second frame, giving the Wolver-
ines a commanding 4-1llead.

A welcomed reality check,

The Michigan hockey
team was elated after
Saturday night's 6-2
spanking of Northern Michigan.
How could it notbe? All the
traditional trends for the sea-
son seemed to have dissipated.
Instead of
allowingsix
goals, the
Wolverines
were finally
the ones
to score
that many.
There was
no collapse LIZ
somewhere VUKELICH
between
the middle
of the second period and the start
of the third. Michigan coach Red
Berenson and the players gushed
about how Saturday's game - the

one that propelled Michigan to
the second round of the CCHA
'playoffs - was the best it's played
all year.
That's all well and good, and.
it's nice to let the Wolverines
enjoy this win. After all, a month
ago, who honestly expected
Michigan to be standing where
it is now?
But don't let the thrill of Satur-
day's victory and the anticipation
of more-playoff hockey detract
from the more important aspect
of the weekend: Friday night.
Entering this weekend's
matchup riding the coattails of
two consecutive sweeps, how
could Michigan notbe feeling on
the top of the world?
But Friday night put the Wol-
verines in their place. It was a
reality check. And abig one at
that.

To be honest, the Wolverines
were lucky to walk away with the
3-2 win. After coming in hot with
a quick succession of three goals
in the first period, Michigan then
reverted back to its old ways.
Though the defense recovered by
the final stanza, it played onits
heels for most of the night and let
the Wildcats back in the game.
"We were losing every foot-
race, everybattle (and) every
faceoff," Berenson said. "They
thought they were playing hard,
but they weren't playing desper-
ate. There's a difference."
Friday was the biggest testof
the season. Could the Wolverines
finally finish off what they had
started without any self-inflicted
harm?
Yes, they could. And without
that challenge, they couldn't
