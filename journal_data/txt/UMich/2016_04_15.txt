Residents call for 
Greg Merritt’s return 
amid controversial 

lease changes

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Greg Merritt, senior associate 

director of University Housing, 
was indefinitely suspended from 
his duties at Munger Graduate 
Residences about a month ago 
and the University of Michigan 
has yet to release an official 
statement regarding the reason his 
suspension, despite student outcry. 

Merritt’s 
leave 
came 
after 

he decided to honor residents’ 
nine-month leases, despite the 
University’s announcement of its 
plans to change 9-month leases 
to 12-month leases, according to 
residents and staff at Munger who 
attended a town hall meeting for 
the building on the issue.

This is the first year Munger 

Graduate Residences have been 

open to students — the hall 
finished construction for the 2015-
2016 academic year at a cost of $155 
million.

Following Merritt’s dismissal, 

members 
of 
the 
Munger 

community have taken several 
actions to express frustration 
about 
the 
decision, 
including 

creating a survey disseminated 
among the building. Results of 
the survey were shared with The 
Michigan Daily.

LSA junior Elizabeth Guthrie, a 

staff member at Munger, wrote in 
the survey that she was upset with 
Merritt’s unexplained departure 
because he was a valuable member 
to both the Munger community 
and the campus at large.

“As an undergraduate student 

who has both worked with Greg 
in Munger and as a first gen 
undergraduate who has engaged 
in meaningful discussions with 
him at first gen meetings, I feel 
upset believing that he may not 
return,” Guthrie wrote. “There is 
very little context given around 
his exit; however, I really want to 
support him in being re-instated.”

Group currently 
represents 5.4 
percent of total 

student enrollment

By NISA KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Amid a push by the University 

of Michigan’s administration to 
create a campus-widestrategic 

plan aimed at improving issues 
of diversity on campus, Latino 
and Latina members of the 
University 
community 
said 

in a series of interviews they 
feel that despite an increase 
of students identifying with 
this group on campus, there is 
more to be done to reach full 
inclusion and equity.

The current makeup of 

Latino students on campus
Hispanic students make up 

5.4 percent of total student 

enrollment, 
which 
breaks 

down to 4.9 percent of the 
undergraduate body and 6.6 
percent of the graduate and 
professional body, according 
the 
University’s 
annual 

enrollment 
report. 
Total 

Hispanic 
enrollment 
has 

increased by 0.75 percent since 
2011. Hispanic students have 
a slightly higher proportional 
representation in the student 
body 
than 
Black 
students, 

another 
underrepresented 

minority 
group 
alongside 

Native Americans, Hawaiians 
and those of mixed race.

Larry La Fountain-Stokes, 

director of Latina/o Studies 
at the University, said despite 
increases in Latino and Latina 
enrollment over the years, the 
group still feels marginalized 
on campus. He pointed to the 
recent growth of the Latino 
population 
in 
Michigan 
as 

a reason for the increase in

Start by Believing 

campaign 

explores issues of 
underreporting

By ISHI MORA

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
of 
Michigan 

leaders 
gathered 
Thursday 

to collaboratively explain the 
underreporting of sexual assault 
— both nationally and at the 
University.

For Sexual Assault Awareness 

Month, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan Department of Public 
Safety and Security and the 
University 
Health 
System, 

along with six other Washtenaw 
County organizations, launched 
the Start by Believing campaign 
on campus, part of a national 
public 
awareness 
initiative 

created by End Violence Against 
Women International.

Sexual assault is one of the 

most underreported crimes in 
the United States. According 
to the Rape, Abuse and Incest 
National Network, 68 percent of 
assaults are never reported and 
only 2 percent of rapists ever 
spend time in prison.

The 2015 Campus Climate 

Survey found that 22.5 percent 
of female undergraduates at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

experienced 
nonconsensual 

touching, kissing or penetration, 
yet in the same year only 
172 incidents were reported, 
according to the Office for 
Institutional 
Equity’s 
second 

annual 
sexual 
misconduct 

report.

EVAWI is a nonprofit founded 

in 2003 by Sergeant Joanne 
Archambault, 
a 
retired 
San 

Diego Police Department officer, 
to improve criminal justice and 
community response to gender-
based violence. The organization 
provides training and technical 
assistance for law enforcement 
agencies investigating sexual 
assault and domestic violence 
cases.

According 
to 
Detective 

Margie Pillsbury, head officer of 
the University Police’s Special 
Victims Unit, the discrepancy 
between 
real 
and 
reported 

cases can be attributed to the 
neurobiology behind trauma and 
sexual assault. Many victims 
of 
traumatic 
events 
cannot 

think rationally during and 
immediately after the event due to 
cellular damage in neurological 
circuits. The temporary damage 
helps the brain manage with 
potentially 
life-threatening 

events like rape, but it inhibits 
their 
ability 
to 
logically 

explain 
the 
circumstances. 

For this reason many people, 
including 
law 
enforcement 

officers, dismiss rape survivors’ 
stories 
as 
nonsensical 
and 

incomprehensible. 
This 
is 

secondary victimization, which 
discourages the victim from 
pursuing the issue further.

Barbara Niess-May, executive 

director of SafeHouse Center, 
said misconceptions about the 
justice system can also influence 
the decision of whether to file a 
report or not.

Contendors for 
administrator 

position speak on 
former experiences

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

The four candidates for the 

position of Ann Arbor city 
administrator discussed their 
backgrounds and approaches to 
management — particularly the 
management of relationships 
between 
local 
communities 

and universities in large college 
towns — during a meet-and-
greet event Thursday evening.

The city has been seeking a 

replacement for Steve Powers, 
the previous city administrator, 
after he left to be city manager 
of Salem, Ore. last October. 
Tom Crawford, the city’s chief 
financial officer, has served as 
interim manager since Powers’ 
departure. The four finalists 
— Thomas Couch of Georgia, 
Paul 
Fetherston 
of 
North 

Carolina, Howard Lazarus of 
Texas and Christian Sigman of 
Ohio — were chosen through 
a nationwide search and will 
be 
publicly 
interviewed 
by 

City Council Saturday before a 
hiring decision is made.

All 
four 
candidates 

emphasized their experience 
working in local government 
in large college communities, 
and said the presence of a large 
research university such as the 
University of Michigan presents

Humor and musical 
performances draw 

more than 300 

students

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Music from popular artists — 

including Beyoncé and Rihanna 
— blared in the Rogel Ballroom 
of the Michigan Union Thursday 
night while more than 300 
students gathered to view a live 
recording of BuzzFeed’s popular 
podcast “Another Round” with 
Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton.

Nigatu 
and 
Clayton, 
both 

journalists, spoke on a wide range 
of social issues regarding race and 
gender stereotypes and social 
problems.

The event, sponsored primarily 

by the School of Social Work’s 
People of Color Collective, blended 
both humor and seriousness in 
discussions about race, gender 
and culture both on campus and 
nationwide. Other sponsors of 
the event included the Office 
of the Vice Provost for Equity, 
Inclusion and Academic Affairs, 
the Department of Afroamerican 
and African American Studies, 
the Women’s Studies Department 
and the Spectrum Center.

Raina 
LaGrand, 
master’s 

student in the School of Social 
Work and the School of Public 
Health, as well as a member of the 
People of Color Collective, said in 
opening remarks that the event 
provided a much-needed platform 
for students of color on campus to 
be engaged.

“We want people of color to feel 

supported, to feel like they have a 
healing space, to feel like they can 
have a co-intentional learning 
space,” LaGrand said.

In an interview after the event, 

LaGrand 
said 
the 
Collective 

believes the podcast brings a new 
lens to the political realm.

in love with the show — their

Strategies slated to 
include diversity, 
equity training for 

staff members

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Diversity, Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
strategic 

plan began a new planning 
process for the University of 
Michigan Health System this 
week. The kick-off brought in 
more than 400 leaders from 
the organization to discuss 
how to create a more diverse 
community within UMHS.

During the kick-off Monday 

events, University President 
Mark Schlissel gave remarks 
focusing on the need for input 
from team members across 
all levels and departments, 
according to a press release.

“We’re 
empowering 

everyone 
to 
get 
involved 

and 
help 
shape 
this 

process,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“If we succeed, it’s not just 
UMHS that benefits; it’s all 
academic 
medical 
centers 

nationally. We’re creating a 
model diversity, equity and 
inclusivity initiative in health 
care across the U.S.”

Schlissel 
launched 
a 

campus-wide strategic plan 
for 
diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion in September 2015, 
startning with events like 
a 
campus-wide 
forum 
on 

issues pertaining to various 
community 
members. 
The 

current step in the process 
includes gathering unit plans 
from 
60 
different 
schools 

and departments on the ways 
they can improve diversity 
respective to their own fields.

Marschall Runge, executive 

vice 
president 
of 
medical 

affairs and dean of the medical 
school, called on the leaders in 

the medical system present to 
involve their personal teams 
in creating DEI initiatives 
specific to their respective 
departments 
or 
areas 
of 

operation.

“We’re strongest when we 

work together,” Runge said 
in a release. “When we better 
understand 
our 
patients, 

we can provide far better 
health care and a much more 
productive work environment 
for faculty and staff and our 
trainees.”

According to the release, the 

planning process will focus on 
six strategies to better help 
leaders 
integrate 
diversity, 

equity and inclusion into their 
operations. With the overall 
hope of creating an inclusive 
environment 
wherein 
all 

faculty, students and patients 
feel valued. Strategies include 
an 
inclusive 
environment, 

DEI 
skill 
building, 

conflict 
resolution, 
career 

development, recruitment and 

hiring and selection.

David Brown, associate 

vice 
president 
and 

associate dean for health 
equity 
and 
inclusion, 

said 
in 
a 
statement 

the 
aforementioned 

strategies 
are 
integral 

for the future success of 
UMHS.

“These strategies are 

placed at the forefront 
of our planning process 
as a way to align our 
activities 
with 
overall 

organizational 
strategic 

plan,” Brown said. “They 
are absolutely crucial to 
the success of our health 
system.”

Location, tradition 

leads to steady 

influx of University 

patrons

By BECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

Though Angelo’s Restaurant 

has served the same menu at the 
same location on Catherine Street 
and Glen Avenue for the past 60 
years, their popularity among 
students and alumni doesn’t seem 
to age.

Angelo’s 
is 
a 
family-run 

breakfast and lunch restaurant 
in Ann Arbor, with an enduring 
backdrop of an old-fashioned diner 
atmosphere.

The owners operate their main 

restaurant building every day of 
the week, as well as Angelo’s on the 
Side, a counter-service and carry-
out coffee house.

Steve Vangelatos, owner of the 

restaurant, said he thinks tradition, 
the food and the atmosphere of 
Angelo’s residents coming back.

Since 
his 
father, 
Angelo 

Vangelatos, opened the restaurant 
after coming to Ann Arbor from 
Greece, Steve has carried on the 
tradition of serving French toast 
and homemade bread. Vangelatos 
said he believes these two dishes 
symbolize why customers return 
to the restaurant.

“The homemade bread, raisin 

bread and the white bread I still 
make every day,” he said.

Andrea Kraus, a dual-degree 

graduate student in Business and 
Rackham and Angelo’s patron, 
echoed Vangelatos.

“All I know is French toast,” 

she said. “People love the French 
toast.”

Vangelatos said many University 

of Michigan alumni make coming 
back to the restaurant every year 
a tradition, such as a group of 19 
alumni from the class of 1985 who 
come back to the restaurant every 
year, sometimes joined by their 
children who also study at the 
University.

LSA 
freshman 
Erin 
Day 

regularly visits the restaurant with 
her father, and said she believes 
traditions like her family’s add to 

the allure of the restaurant. 

“More than the restaurant 

itself, I really like being with my 
family,” Day said. “It’s one of my 
dad’s favorite restaurants. I think 
the tradition, and the name, keeps 
it around.”

Vangelatos 
noted 
that 
the 

restaurant’s 
proximity 
to 
the 

University hospital and contributes 
to the restaurant’s popularity. LSA 
senior Jed Johnson expressed 
similar sentiments, saying he 
thinks the young neighborhood 
drives the business.

“It’s a really good location,” he 

said. “It’s in Kerrytown, so there 
are a lot of artsy people that live in 
that part of town.”

Though the restaurant is family-

run, Angelo’s maintains a group 
of dedicated employees, many of 
whom have worked there for more 
than 10 years. Vangelatos said on 
most weekends, he will typically 
have at least four family members 
working by his side.

Steve’s son, Tony Vangelatos, is 

the manager of the store. Tony said 
the food and traditions have kept 
the restaurant alive and growing 
over the years.

KRISTINA PERKINS/Daily

Angelo’s is open from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. at its location on Catherine Street and Glen Avenue.

a unique set of challenges 
and 
opportunities 
to 
the 

surrounding community.

Lazarus 
and 
Fetherston 

noted public universities are 
tax-exempt and can therefore 
eat into the tax base of the local 
city whenever they expand.

“As the University grows, 

there’s this balance between 
taxable properties and non-
taxable,” Lazarus said, adding 
he has been able to maintain a 
beneficial relationship between 
the University of Texas and the 
city of Austin while the city’s 
director for public works and 
interim city manager.

Couch 
— 
the 
county 

administrator 
of 
Bulloch 

County, 
where 
Georgia 

Southern University is located 
— also noted large universities 
can 
act 
with 
significant 

autonomy 
from 
their 
local 

municipal 
government, 

referencing 
his 
experience 

maintaining 
his 
county’s 

relationship with its university.

“You 
have 
to 
develop 

intimate 
relationships 
with 

university personnel,” Couch 
said.

He also noted that Georgia 

Southern 
has 
experienced 

tensions with its surrounding 
community over issues such as 
land development.

However, 
despite 
the 

challenges they cited, all the 
candidates 
agreed 
a 
large 

university is a major asset 
to its local community, and 
meaningful 
relationships 

between all levels of local 
government 
and 
university 

administration need to be built 
for mutual benefit. 

Lazarus said cities and their 

local universities need to work 
toward their common interests 
rather than take an adversarial 
stance, which he said he’s done 
in his roles in Austin.

“Ann Arbor prospers because 

it (has a) great university, and 

you can’t lose sight of that,” 
Lazarus 
said. 
“University 

administration wants to have 
that fuzzy edge between the 
University and the town to be 
seamless. They want the kids 
to be safe and they want the 
parents to know their kids are 
safe. They also want a town 
that 
supports 
their 
desire 

to recruit and retain a top-
notch faculty … great cities 
and great universities have 
a relationship where a city 
provides opportunities to the 
students and the university 
provides research and input for 
the town.”

Fetherston 
discussed 
his 

experience 
as 
an 
assistant 

city administrator in Boulder, 
Colo., 
saying 
he 
made 
an 

effort to work with not only 
the top administration of the 
University of Colorado, but also 
the lower level staff and the 
student body.

“For some time we were 

shooting to interface at the 
chancellor level, and based on 

the dynamics at that time it 
was the wrong place to try to 
influence,” 
Fetherston 
said. 

“So we worked more with the 
vice-chancellor, more with the 
housing department.”

Sigman 
— 
the 
county 

administrator 
of 
Hamilton 

County, 
Ohio 
and 
former 

budget director of Cincinnati 
and Washington D.C. — added 
that 
as 
city 
administrator 

he 
would 
want 
to 
build 

relationships with not just the 
University administration, but 
also the other largest local 
stakeholders.

“If 
you 
don’t 
have 
a 

relationship when an issue 
comes up, it’s hard to work with 
the issue,” Sigman said. “Job 
one for the city administrator 
is to get to know the public 
stakeholders … you’ve got to 
develop a rapport with not just 
the University president, but 
the bank president, the editor 
of the newspaper, the union 
officials.”

Guthrie 
wasn’t 
alone 
in 

her sentiments: More than 70 
people also participated in the 
survey, most of whom proposed 
returning Merritt to his position, 
often writing “#BringGregBack.”

A 
staff 
member 
working 

at 
Munger, 
who 
requested 

anonymity due to fear of losing 
their job, said in an interview that 
Munger community members 
are frustrated because no one has 
been able to reach Merritt and 
University Housing is instead 

speaking on his behalf.

“Greg has been the most 

transparent person I’ve ever met,” 
the staff member said. “So for him 
to literally leave without even a 
goodbye just seems to elicit the 
fact that this isn’t his decision 
and this has to do with something 
larger than what we know about.”

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald declined to respond to 
questions about Merritt and said 
the University does not discuss 
individual personnel matters.

LSA freshman Jovany Flores, 

a staff member at Munger, said 
Merritt has been a mentor to him 
by helping Flores build his resume 

and find internships.

“Any time I have questions 

or doubts or really I’m confused 
about what to do I always go to 
him,” Flores said.

Munger 
resident 
Chiedozie 

Okafor, a graduate student in 
both the Ross School of Business 
and the School of Education, 
said Munger residents are now 
uncertain 
what 
their 
living 

experience 
will 
entail 
with 

Merritt’s suspension.

“Do I want to stay in the 

fellowship, do I want to live in 
Munger, do I want to be a part of 
this team now? Because I don’t 
have any sense of where it could 

go,” Okafor said.

Okafor added that though the 

Munger living experience has 
been developed as it has happened 
during 
its 
inaugural 
year, 

residents have felt comfortable 
with not knowing the exact 
direction because of Merritt.

“With Greg, even though you 

weren’t sure about the exact 
direction we were going or we 
were shifting to, I think a lot of 
the faith resided that Greg was 
leading it,” he said. “There was 
faith in Greg, so we have faith that 
the intentions were always going 
to be good no matter where we 
went.”

enrollment, 
but 
noted 
that 

the student body does not 
reflect the country in terms of 
diversity.

Latinos make up 17.4 percent 

of 
Michigan’s 
population, 

according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau.

La 
Fountain-Stokes 
also 

attributed some of the changes 
in Latino enrollment to factors 
like 
faculty 
and 
student 

involvement, and outreach to 
communities within the state, 
other states and Puerto Rico.

“Latinos 
are 
still 
very 

dramatically underrepresented 
but I think many of the efforts 
to 
recruit 
underrepresented 

students are being successful,” 
he said.

Multiple 
students 
and 

faculty echoed La Fountain-
Stokes’ 
sentiments, 
saying 

despite an increase of students 
in past years, many aspects 
of inclusivity and equity still 
have 
significant 
room 
for 

improvement

Business senior Stephanie 

Betancourt, an undergraduate 
student representative for the 
Latina/o Studies board, said she 
is one of three Latina women 
she knows of in the Ross School 
of Business and does not believe 
there are enough Latinos or 
people of color in general in 
the school. Betancourt also 
noted that many faculty or 
staff members do not share 
the 
same 
perspectives 
as 

Latino students in the Business 
School, 
saying 
diversity 
is 

important in business schools 
because business professionals 
often work with people from 
around the country, of various 
backgrounds.

“If it is just one homogenous 

group 
talking 
to 
another 

homogenous 
group, 
then 

there is never going to be real 
progress,” she said.

Members of the Latino Law 

Students Association — a law 
student organization that puts 
emphasis on promoting more 
opportunities for Latinos and 
Latinas in the field and at the 
University — echoed similar 
sentiments on more diversity in 
professional schools.

First-year law student Mayté 

Salazar, LLSA’s Political Action 
Chair, said she believes the 
racial demographics of the 
Law 
School 
should 
reflect 

those of the United States. The 
Law School currently has 35 
Hispanic 
students 
enrolled, 

making up just 4 percent of the 
student body.

“We can always do more to 

increase Latino representation 
at the law schools across the 
country, including Michigan 

Law, to mirror contemporary 
American 
demographics,” 

Salazar said. “We have to think 
about diversity initiatives at 
the Law School in light of the 
number of Latinos graduating 
high school and college, and 
the kind of resources Latino 
students have at their disposal 
as 
they 
are 
matriculating 

through 
high 
school 
and 

college.”

First-year 
law 
student 

Melody Latino, who is also 
a LLSA member, said LLSA 
hopes to address these issues by 
actively engaging with Latino 
students. Over the past few 
years, this has included inviting 
undergraduate students to a 
panel featuring a successful 
Latina attorney, or hosting the 
male pageant Mr. Wolverine, 
which supports giving financial 
aid to LLSA members who work 
in unpaid summer internships.

Latino 
said 
she 
believes 

the 
University 
has 
taken 

steps 
to 
improve 
racial 

diversity, but added it is still 
important to continue making 
improvements. 

“There 
is 
always 
room 

to improve, and we need to 
increase diversity, especially 
racial diversity at the Law 
School,” 
Latino 
said. 
“The 

need for racial diversity is not 
something unique to Michigan. 
It happens at law schools all 
over the country.”

Sarah 
Zearfoss, 
senior 

assistant dean for admissions 
at the Law School, wrote in an 
e-mail interview she believes 
having diverse representation 
in the Law School can lead to a 
better learning environment for 
all students, and enhance their 
skill sets as lawyers.

“Having 
well-informed 

participants in those exchanges 
enhances 
the 
development 

of our law and therefore, I 
would argue, of our culture 
and our country,” Zearfoss 
wrote. “Having a variety of 
perspectives involved in the 
classroom discussions will help 
our students learn how to be 
more effective and persuasive 
of people whose point of view 
differs from theirs, which is the 
essence of successful litigation.”
Legal barriers to increasing 

numbers

However, 
despite 
the 

recognition of the importance 
of increasing diversity by both 
students and administrators, 
the University is restricted in 
its efforts to increase Latino 
representation 
by 
Proposal 

2, which banned the use of 
affirmative action in college 
admission 
in 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan in April 2014. That 
ban 
includes 
a 
prohibition 

on looking specifically at an 
applicant’s race or ethnicity in 
the admissions process.

Zearfoss said the admissions 

office has not changed its views 
on diversity since the ban, but 
has rather begun employing 
different practices. In light 
of the affirmative action ban, 
the 
Law 
School 
increased 

their emphasis on soliciting 
applications, and on increasing 
the number of accepted offers of 
admission to maintain a racially 
diverse class without factoring 
race into an application.

“It is certainly true that Prop. 

2 has removed our ability to take 
race into account as a factor in 
making an admissions decision, 
but that doesn’t mean our desire 
to have a racially diverse class 
has changed,” Zearfoss said.

Both Salazar and Latino 

said they thought affirmative 
action was one ideal way to 
increase diversity, saying the 
ban stymied efforts to do so on 
campus.

“We want to believe we 

don’t 
need 
these 
policies 

because we are a ‘race-blind’ 
society,” Salazar said. “But this 
‘colorblind’ fiction is one that 
erases the melanin in our skin, 
the struggles we have endured 
and the stories that remain 
untold.”

Despite 
benefits 
from 

affirmative 
action 
policy, 

however, 
Latino 
said 
she 

thought it is possible to promote 
diversity in other ways than 
just racial consideration in 
applications.

She noted that one way to do 

that is focusing on the pipeline 
from college to law school, 
which she said LLSA seeks 
to expand by connecting law 
students with undergraduate 
and high school students.

Salazar 
added 
the 
issue 

of diversity supersedes the 
admissions 
process, 
and 

emphasized 
that 
minority 

students also need continuous 
support when they get to 
campus.

“We 
must 
then 
realize 

how the lack of resources in 
our communities put Latino 
students 
at 
an 
academic 

disadvantage,” 
Salazar 
said. 

“The issue is not only how many 
people are getting through the 
door and sitting at the table, 
but also how many people are 
getting to the door.”
Student activism for Latino 

representation

Echoing Salazar’s sentiments 

about 
experience 
when 
on 

campus, 
Betancourt 
also 

said she thinks activism in 
undergraduate 
students 
has 

been decreasing for Latina/o 
students in recent years.

In 
particular, 
she 
said 

older students seem to be 
most 
involved, 
suggesting 

that potentially the younger 
generation either has not sought 
out more questions or the 

inspiration for activism hasn’t 
been passed down to them.

LSA junior Ramiro Alvarez, 

who participated in various 
activist groups on campus, said 
he thought the peak of Latino 
activism 
at 
the 
University 

was reached a long time ago, 
whereas Latino activism today 
has dwindled. That activism, 
he added, had noticeable ties to 
Latino identity on campus.

“There seems to be this huge 

history in the Bentley Library 
archives of us doing really 
radical and important work 
with multiple organizations,” 
Alvarez said. “That’s really put 
me in an ambivalent place about 
what it means to be Latino on 
this campus.”

Overall, Alvarez said he’s 

found campus to be a hostile 
place 
for 
people 
of 
color 

in 
recent 
years, 
citing 
an 

incident in which a faculty 
member asked him if he was 
documented. He added that 
while he sees value in hosting 
events, he’s also hoping to see 
activism in more radical forms 
as it had been done in the past.

“For example, BBUM and 

UM Divest, there were very 
little Latinos who showed up 
for that,” he said.

While 
Alvarez 
and 

Betancourt 
both 
said 
they 

believe the University succeeds 
in getting people of color into 
the school, they also said they 
think the University can do 
more with retention.

“It’s been real. With any 

Latino senior you ask, we can 
name countless friends who are 
no longer here and entered with 
us freshmen year,” Alvarez said. 
“And that’s a root issue and it’s 
harder for the University to 
tackle its demons, like financial 
accessibility 
or 
adequate 

mental health support that are 
deterring these students,”

Betancourt 
also 
cited 

hiring more Latino and Latina 
faculty members as a way the 
University could aid students 
during their time in school.

Nonetheless, for the students 

that are there, both students 
and faculty said they believe 
they have a noticeable presence 
on campus.

In the Law School, Salazar 

wrote that despite the small 
population, she believes the 
Law School’s Latinos have a 
strong impact on the rest of 
campus.

“Michigan Law has a vibrant 

and active Latino community. 
As one of my friends put it, 
‘Somos chiquitos pero picosos,’ 
” Salazar wrote. “ ‘We are small, 
but spicy,’ meaning we don’t 
make up a large portion of the 
student body, but our existing 
community still makes a huge 
impact at the Law School and 
beyond.”

discussion of race and gender and 
politics, but also this combination 
of mental health and self-care,” 
LaGrand said. “I hope that people 
who are of color will feel celebrated 
and 
acknowledged 
and 
the 

University and different partners 
are doing something to provide this 
space for them.”

Throughout the show, Nigatu 

and Clayton encouraged audience 
interaction through video links to 
highlight both light and serious 
topics. The biggest portion of the 
evening centered on a discussion 
with Tunde Olaniran, a Flint, Mich. 
native and musical artist. Clayton 
asked Olaniran about growing up 
in Flint and the current watercrisis.

“You can’t ignore these people 

because they don’t fit an ideal,” 
Olaniran said. “We need to put 
pressure on our legislators to 
really — I’m going to get technical 
— but we need to push for more 
appropriations or aid in Flint … 
People are often just gambling with 
their health.”

Clayton said the extent of the 

crisis happening in Flint was 
unimaginable, 
asking 
Olaniran 

about the sparse availability of 
water many community members 

in Flint have experienced.

“You just know that if the 

majority of the people affected were 
white, the response would be so 
different, so much faster, so much 
more immediate,” Clayton said.

Nyshourn Price, School of Social 

Work Student Services admissions 
coordinator, said she thought it was 
beneficial to host the speakers to 
foster more discussion on topics of 
social justice.

“I 
think 
it’s 
vital 
to 
the 

community and what’s going on 
in the world,” Price said. “Having 
conversations, being able to cross-
connect with issues and have a 
voice particularly for, I call it Black 
and brown, but people of color, 
because there’s a lot going on.”

Storee Harris, a master’s student 

in the School of Public Health, said 
she came to the event because she 
follows Clayton on Twitter and 
was curious to see what the two 
speakers had to say. Harris said 
their points of view are crucial to 
having an open discussion about 
race and inclusion, especially on a 
university campus.

“I think Michigan is trying to 

become more diverse, but I think 
seeing this type of inclusiveness — 
everyone in here may be of color, 
but here for different reasons — this 
gives Michigan a way to become 
more inclusive,” Harris said.

“Some people think that if 

it happened 72 hours after the 
assault, you can’t report it. Of 
course you can,” she said.

According to Tim Johnson, 

chair 
of 
the 
Department 
of 

Obstetrics and Gynecology at the 
University Health System and a 
women’s studies professor at the 
University, long-term problems for 
sexual assault survivors include 
ongoing physical and psychosocial 
concerns that may last a lifetime.

Thus, Start by Believing aims 

to transform society’s negative 
attitude by affirming a victim’s 
story, accelerating rehabilitation 
and expediting the justice process.

Niess-May said simply listening 

is a key step in ameliorating the 
situation.

“Sometimes what (sexual assault 

survivors) say and how they say it is 
almost incredulous,” she said. “But 
in the end, you need to listen and 
not ask a lot of questions.”

Niess-May 
also 
explained 

that sexual assault survivors are 
unlikely 
to 
remember 
details 

about the situation, like victims 
of car accidents. Asking too many 
questions to a person who just 
experienced trauma, she said, is 
counterproductive.

“The survivor has been through 

trauma, and just like if you were in 
a car accident, it might be harder to 
remember, ‘When did the wheels 
squeal?’ or ‘When did the glass 
break?’ or ‘When did the safety 
(air)bag deploy?’ ” she said. “You 
don’t remember in what order that 
all happened and why it happened 
or what precipitated it all. And 
that’s the same thing for a survivor 
of sexual assault.”

According 
to 
Niess-May, 

the partnership between Start 
by Believing and the various 
Washtenaw County organizations 
began after a SafeHouse volunteer 
learned about the initiative at 
a 
conference 
and 
contacted 

the 
organization’s 
partners, 

including DPSS, about it. They 
responded 
enthusiastically 

and spread the idea all over the 
county to the point that on April 
6, the Washtenaw County Board 
of 
Commissionersproclaimed 

Washtenaw County the nation’s 
first “Start by Believing Survivors 
of Sexual Assault” county.

“The University of Michigan 

police really ran with it,” she 
said. “The officers there said, 
‘This is what we really need to be 
implementing in our community.’ ”

Sexual 
Assault 
Awareness 

Month at the University began 
with SAPAC on the Diag on April 
1, where SAPAC Peer Education 
program volunteers educated the 
community on consent and self-
care.

On April 6, the National Start 

by Believing Day, the participants 
of the 38th annualTake Back the 
Night rally marched around the 
campus demanding an end to 
sexual violence.

Pillsbury, also one of the guest 

speakers at Take Back the Night, 
stressed the importance of officers 
having a basic understanding of 
trauma and engaging thoughtfully 
with survivors.

“When 
we’re 
interviewing 

a survivor of sexual assault, we 
understand that it takes a ton of 

courage to come forward,” she said. 
“We try to build a rapport with 
them and set their minds at ease.”

She explained the role that 

building a rapport with the victim 
plays in the process of holding 
assailants accountable.

“We try and make doing an 

interview with them as least 
intrusive or difficult as we can,” 
she said. “We usually find that 
building a rapport with people and 
acknowledging what they’ve been 
through goes a long way in just 
helping us get the information that 
we need from them … We want you 
to be OK, that’s the first and most 
important thing.”

Susan 
Kheder, 
executive 

director of Patient and Community 
Engagement at St. Joseph Mercy 
Ann 
Arbor 
and 
Livingston 

hospitals, echoed the sentiment. 
She stressed the importance of law 
enforcement, hospitals and local 
advocates working together to help 
survivors.

“For those that have been raped, 

obtaining 
immediate 
care 
to 

address any health issues, as well 
as to collect forensic evidence, is 
so important,” Kheder said. “At 
the same time, the sooner the 
individual can be connected with 
the local resources and advocates 
to assist with counseling, health 
management, legal advocacy and 
short- and long-term safety issues 
the sooner the recovery process 
can begin.”

There are two hospitals that 

are partners of Start by Believing, 
the University Health System and 
St. Joseph Mercy Health System. 
According to Johnson, health care 
professionals play a crucial role in 
helping sexual assault survivors 
recuperate, 
especially 
Sexual 

Assault Nurse Examiners who 
carry out medical forensic care of 
the patient.

LSA senior Laura Meyer, SAPAC 

volunteer 
co-coordinator, 
said 

because of efforts like Start by 
Believing, she has seen positive 
change in campus attitude.

“There is a generally greater 

awareness of SAPAC and its 
services on campus when we 
are out in the community, and 
the volunteer coordinators have 
received 
even 
more 
outreach 

from community members and 
organizations who are eager to 
partner with SAPAC,” she said.

Meyer also urged students to 

attend workshops and know their 
rights in order to spread sexual 
assault awareness even further.

“Our 
Peer 
Education 
and 

Bystander 
Intervention 
and 

Community Engagementprograms 
do incredible work reaching out 
into the community to educate 
and engage students,” she said. 
“Additionally, I would encourage 
everyone to educate themselves 
on their rights as students by 
reading the revised policy and 
by researching at Know Your 
IX, an education and advocacy 
organization focused on Title IX.”

Meyer said each of us can make 

a difference in preventing sexual 
assault cases and helping survivors.

“Students 
should 
be 
ready 

to engage their communities in 
conversations about sexual assault 
and sexual violence by believing 
and 
supporting 
survivors, 

centering the voices of survivors, 
and respecting the agency and 
choices of survivors,” she said.

Our year ahead

DAVID SCHAFER AND MICAH GRIGGS | OP-ED

T

he viral video of Jake Croman launching 
an onslaught of verbal assaults on a 
local Uber driver reminded me of my 

experiences working at McDonald’s. I recall 
my first day, when a younger, more enthusiastic 
version of myself was incredibly excited to start 
his first real job. I was completely oblivious 
to the experiences that lied ahead, most of 
which were not the positive experiences I had 
optimistically anticipated.

I quickly learned how to use the register, and 

that’s where I spent most of my 15 hours each 
week. Though I was balancing my schoolwork 
with working at McDonald’s, 15 hours per week 
was very manageable, and actually a blessing. 
Though the paychecks were small, I was 
enjoying the relationships I was building with 
my coworkers, which helped me to forget the 
regular belittlement from customers regarding 
tasks that were out of my control.

Customer 
complaints 
usually 
reached 

me first, as I was the first person visible 
to frustrated customers. The complaints 
generally involved food being too cold or a 
sandwich having toppings that the customer 
specifically requested be removed, and were 
usually followed by a sentence like this: “This 
is why your wages are so low!” or “You can’t 
even perform the most basic tasks!” or “This 
is absurd, can anyone here do their job right?” 
As the new worker and per McDonald’s policy, 
my mindset was always to apologize without 
hesitation and ask how I could help fix the 
problem. The customer is always right.

The 
realization 
that 
I 
completely 

overestimated the extent to which I would 
enjoy working at McDonald’s came over the 
course of the summer, but I believe the process 
of said realization can be summed up in three 
events that made me feel inadequate, worthless 
and subhuman.

First, corporate employees occasionally 

come through as customers to make sure we 
are meeting their standards. By the time this 
happened to me, I was working the drive-
through window where customers pay for 
their order. I read off the corporate employee’s 
two item order, “six-piece and a large Coke?” 
and she handed me her card. As I slid the 
card, I asked “Would you like your receipt?” 
She nodded and I returned her card with a 
receipt. Instead of driving off, she told me I 
was doing everything wrong. I looked at her 
puzzled. She informed me that I didn’t need 
to read the whole order to confirm the order 
was hers (which makes some sense for long 
orders, but her order was two items!) and 
told me to always give the customers their 
receipts. Internally frustrated, I remained 
calm and thanked her for the advice. So, I 
returned receipts to every customer. And, 
unsurprisingly, I had a lot of them crumpled 
up and thrown back at me as customers told 
me that nobody ever wants a receipt. Initially, 
that wasn’t a big deal to me, but the repetition 
of getting paper crumpled and thrown at 
you combined with condescending remarks 
becomes quite frustrating.

Second, only a few days later, a woman 

attempted to use a coupon for a beverage that 
wasn’t covered by the coupon, and when I 

explained to her that she couldn’t use it, she 
proceeded to tell me that she was in “the legal 
business,” and that what I was doing was 
“illegal.” I again explained why she couldn’t 
use the coupon, and she responded with a 
brief rant: “You need to go back to school and 
get educated, because you clearly don’t know 
much. That’s probably why you’re working this 
job. Go back to school and educate yourself 
a bit.” In this scenario, though I was furious, 
I was required to keep my cool and allow the 
woman to disparage me because “the customer 
is always right.”

The most dehumanizing experience of 

working at McDonald’s was by far the worst 
experience of my life. Someone urinated and 
defecated on the floor of the men’s bathroom, 
and I was the lucky individual who cleaned it 
up. Several of my coworkers had to deal with 
the same problem both before and after I did, as 
that was not an isolated incident.

While the extreme nature of Jake Croman’s 

comments may have been an isolated case, low-
wage workers experience similar belittlement 
quite regularly, and often for no reason. For 
fast-food workers specifically (I can’t speak 
on behalf of other minimum-wage jobs, but I’d 
be willing to bet the experiences are similar), 
the nature of the work itself in addition to 
the poor treatment from customers can be 
dehumanizing.

Working a minimum-wage job forces you to 

swallow your pride and essentially accept that 
you are going to be viewed by a large majority 
as inferior and insignificant. Coming to terms 
with this can be difficult. Personally, I think 
this is what prompts fast-food and low-wage 
workers around the country to push for higher 
pay. The work itself is not particularly difficult, 
but the persistent dehumanization that low-
wage workers are forced to endure (sometimes 
slightly warranted, but generally unwarranted) 
combined with the low wages encourages 
workers to put forth the least effort possible.

Frankly, my work ethic dropped immensely 

as my time at McDonald’s progressed. I think 
one way to alter work ethic of workers is to raise 
the wages. Costco pays its workers much more 
than fast-food companies, and the results are 
clear in customer satisfaction ratings, where 
Costco ranks among the best in the country. 
Many people believe that minimum-wage 
workers are paid low because the quality of 
their work is minimum. For the most part, this 
is a serious misconception, as the quality of the 
work is absolutely better than the wages we are 
paid.

Additionally, I firmly believe that the 

stigma for working a low-wage job combined 
with the wages themselves are responsible for 
the “low-quality” work. Raise people’s wages 
and start showing respect to the minimum-
wage workers and I guarantee that there 
will be an improvement in workers’ efforts 
and attitudes. Continue to treat minimum-
wage workers as inferior while paying them 
poverty wages and I guarantee workers will 
progressively care less about the quality of 
their work.

RYAN ROOSE | OP-ED

T

he official results were 
released a couple weeks 
ago, and we are humbled 

and honored to have been elected 
to serve as the University of 
Michigan’s 
Central 
Student 

Government president and vice 
president. We could not be more 
grateful for everyone’s support 
and we look forward to continuing 
to advocate for the voices of the 
student body and serving all of 
you in the upcoming year.

We acknowledge the, at times, 

difficult relationship CSG has had 
with the student body. We ran on a 
platform designed to improve this 
connection and to make student 
government 
more 
inclusive, 

representative and productive. 
With the election now over, many 
students will be closely watching 
to see whether, and how much, we 
actualize our policy and platform 
ideas into a reality.

From 
calls 
for 
greater 

transparency 
from 
CSG, 
an 

increased 
focus 
on 
diversity 

and inclusion, efforts to raise 
awareness of sexual assault and 
the expansion of mental health 
resources, we, and the other 
CSG 
candidates, 
made 
many 

promises during last month’s 
election. Thousands of students 
engaged in these conversations, 
and they ultimately exercised 
their right to vote and made 
their voices heard. Too often, 
however, this groundswell of 
support and interest in CSG 
significantly subsides following 
the election. We know that CSG 

must work and connect with the 
incredible student organizations 
at Michigan not just during the 
campaign, but throughout the 
year.

In the year ahead, we expect to 

face our fair share of challenges. 
There will be setbacks and false 
starts, but we are optimistic for 
a successful year. This requires 
us to not overlook or remain 
ignorant of the many areas in 
need of improvement at the 

University. When a student does 
not have equal access to mental 
health resources, that matters 
to all of us, even if it’s not us or 
someone we know. In the same 
spirit, when a student is targeted 
or made to feel unsafe because of 
their identity, that matters to all 
of us, even if it’s not us or someone 
we know who is excluded.

This 
ideal 
has 
become 

increasingly relevant. Over the 
last two weeks, horrific messages, 

including 
“#StopIslam,” 
have 

been chalked and then re-chalked 
on the Diag. This demands action 
and opposition from all students. 
We must not use free speech as 
an excuse to stand idly by when 
fellow members of our Michigan 
community are harmed. Nor can 
we properly call ourselves allies 
if our activism starts and ends 
with the sharing of a Facebook 
post. Only when we begin to look 
at our Michigan experience as 
inextricably bound to those of 
every other student here can we 
truly step up and fully serve all of 
the University.

With this in mind, especially 

over the next year as we begin 
the year-long celebration of the 
University’s 200th birthday, we 
challenge and call on you to be 
involved on campus. Embrace the 
role of student leader and work 
to advance the opportunities 
and enhance the experiences 
of your fellow Wolverines. We 
hope you will never hesitate to 
challenge us or call us out when 
necessary. Please stop us on the 
Diag or reach out to us via e-mail 
or social media about any concern 
or suggestions you might have. 
This election was about you, and 
so is the year ahead. You were 
our voice during the election, and 
thus we promise to always listen 
to yours in the year ahead. Thank 
you, and forever go blue!

“In the year ahead, 
we expect to face 
our fair share of 

challenges... but we 
are optimistic for a 

successful year.”

Dear members of the University 
Michigan community,

We stand with our friends, 

students, colleagues and with the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs and Central 
Student Government, and the Senate 
Assembly in condemning the recent 
anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and 
anti-activist chalkings on the Diag. 
Whatever the political motivations 
of those engaged in such acts, 
their expressions of disrespect for 
members of our community can 
have nothing but a chilling effect 
on the social and intellectual life of 
this campus.

We want to underscore that 

Muslim students and colleagues 
are integral members of this 
campus community and make 
important contributions to the 
life of the institution. We thus 
endorse 
SACUA’s 
December 

resolution 
“to 
unequivocally 

oppose 
and 
condemn 
all 

attempts to discriminate against, 
marginalize, 
or 
denigrate 

students, faculty or staff on the 
basis of religious faith, national 
origin or ethnic belonging.” And 
we call on all members of the 
community — students, faculty, 
staff and administrators — to join 
in support of the right of everyone, 
as CSG put it, “to be free from 

discrimination, persecution, and 
to be treated with dignity and 
respect by the University and the 
campus community.”

Finally, we want to emphasize 

the urgency of the situation. 
We 
call 
on 
the 
University 

administration to join with us 
to find more effective means of 
helping ensure that the objectives 
of establishing an inclusive and 
diverse campus are realized.

Sincerely,
University faculty

An anti-intolerance statement

UNIVERSITY FACULTY | OP-ED

I 

can’t tell you how many times 
I’ve seen Kim Kardashian’s 
naked body. That’s not to 

say I’m both-
ered by it. To 
me, I couldn’t 
care less, you 
do 
you 
girl. 

Be naked. We 
were all born 
that way. Quite 
recently, 
Kim 

posted a naked 
selfie 
with 
a 

caption 
about 

having nothing 
to wear. Even 
more recently than that, Kim 
posted another selfie with Emily 
Ratajkowski — again she was bar-
ing all, but this time the selfie was 
her way of fighting back. With 
both of their middle fingers in the 
air, Kim and Emily were silent-
ly condemning the people who 
called out Kim the first time.

The initial selfie prompted 

much criticism. For example, 
Piers Morgan went as far as to 
tweet a comparison of Emme-
line Pankhurst and Kim to really 
show her that she killed feminism. 
He didn’t stop there because, of 
course, she really doesn’t under-
stand that, according to him, her 
nakedness is not helping femi-
nism progress at all. So he decided 
to write an entire column explain-
ing to Kim why her body frequent-
ly being on display is becoming a 
joke and obviously just a cry for 
attention since her younger sis-
ters are now apparently getting 
more attention than her.

But when Amy Schumer does 

it she’s brave and considered an 
inspiration. What’s the differ-
ence between Amy and Kim? Is it 
because Amy isn’t overtly sexual-
ized on a daily basis? Or is it her 
“plus size” physique that makes it 

OK? There shouldn’t be standards 
for when and how women display 
their sexuality. Nudity does not 
equal bravery if you’re not stick 
thin, nor does it equate to slutti-
ness if you are

One of the responses to Kim’s 

latest nude display was the fact 
that she has children now and 
should be embarrassed to be 
naked everywhere, just in case 
they might come across that in the 
future. I hate to break the news 
to people who have this reaction, 
but one of the reasons Kim is a 
household name is because of her 
sex tape. If her kids aren’t going 
to come across her naked selfies, 
they’ll definitely find her tape, 
which, if I remember correctly, 
wasn’t even released with her per-
mission. These pictures are being 
taken and shown to the public at 
her own discretion. Is it not bet-
ter for Kim to have pictures of her 
body she chose to put out in the 
world for her kids to come across? 
After all, she birthed them. Her 
body probably isn’t something 
they haven’t seen themselves 
at one point in their lives. Oh, 
and she’s also still allowed to be 
sexual. Not that she needs our 
permission; but obviously she 
does, 
because 
motherhood 
is 

completely asexualized and used 
as a weapon against women who 
choose to show their sexuality in 
any way after giving birth.

Others argue that her nudity 

doesn’t set a good example for 
young women. I intensely beg to 
differ. Naked women are literally 
everywhere in the media. Often 
they are portrayed without much 
agency and as objects. I’m not 
saying we should all run out and 
start taking nude selfies in soli-
darity with Kardashian; not all 
of us have the luxury of working 
in an industry where sending out 

nude selfies helps us profession-
ally. Women deal with enough 
garbage regarding body positivity 
on a day-to-day basis — are we too 
fat, too skinny? We’re trained to 
not like our bodies regardless of 
what they look like.

Kim Kardashian, who I would 

consider a very beautiful woman 
with a drop-dead gorgeous body, 
is shamed for posing naked — 
why? Is it because she hasn’t 
stopped global warming or run 
for Congress? Who is the ultimate 
decision-maker when it comes 
to deciding whether Kim Kar-
dashian’s nudity is empowering 
or not? Is nudity only considered 
“empowering” if the women pos-
ing nude for cameras don’t fit typ-
ical western beauty ideals? This is 
the perfect opportunity to open a 
dialogue about loving ourselves 
but instead, we’ve used it as a 
springboard to throw Kardashian 
under the bus.

It’s not detrimental to feminism 

if a woman loves her body and 
wants to show it off. Feminism 
fights for equality. A naked pair of 
tits is not going to revoke our right 
to vote. This is really just a mas-
sive case of slut shaming. Women 
don’t need a reason to strip down 
other than because that they want 
to. Kim Kardashian’s nudity isn’t 
the problem here. It’s society’s 
frequent freak-outs over women 
taking control of their sexuality 
and refusing to be used as objects.

Love her or hate her, Kardashi-

an has made a valid statement. She 
and Ye are still laughing their way 
to the bank to transfer millions 
into their joint account, regard-
less of whether or not you’re 
offended by her nudity.

Ben Harper’s ‘Call It’ 
is eclectic dad rock

By JOEY SCHUMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Ben Harper & The Innocent 

Criminals’s latest studio album, 
Call It What It Is, kicks off with 
a major dad 
quote: 
“I 

remember 
when 
sex 

was dirty / 
and the air 
was clean / 
and 
every-

thing worth 
knowing 
/ was in a 
magazine.”

The whole 

dad quote thing makes sense, 
considering Harper has been 
putting out music for over 20 
years and is an actual middle-
aged dad presumably living a 
middle-aged dad life. More spe-
cifically, though, this line seems 
to be Harper acknowledging and 
embracing this senior status — 
using his veteran savvy to set the 
tone for an album so in line with 
who he is, and what his career 
has been — and everything feels 
right.

“When Sex Was Dirty,” the 

aforementioned opening track, 

has its aggressive guitar riffs and 
prominent cowbell followed up 
with a potpourri of style on other 
songs that, while not consistent, 
is no doubt entertaining. There’s 
cause for confusion when Harp-
er, just two tracks after the light-
hearted opener, rolls out a line 
like “They shot him in the back / 
now it’s a crime to be Black / so 
don’t act surprised / when it gets 
vandalized” on “Call It What It 
Is.” But maybe, just maybe, that’s 
Harper’s thing. Maybe making 
the title track a bluesy, condemn-
ing political statement for the 
masses is Harper’s ultimate “I 
Don’t Give a Fuck, I’ll Do What 
I Want, I’ve Done My Time In 
This Game” moment. This is an 
artist who has made cuddly bal-
lads about stealing kisses, reg-
gae jams about making peace on 
earth and seemingly everything 
in between. And now it’s time 
for one of music’s most versatile 
renaissance men to do what he 
wants.

Ironically enough, one of the 

better tracks on the album is one 
that perhaps most lacks a defining 
identity. “Shine,” the fifth track, 
vibes. On it, Harper sings, “We 
shine like a new tattoo / scarred 
on skin bright as day / across my 

heart / there is no other way.” 
Set over a fun, percussion-heavy 
beat, the production isn’t any-
thing distinct, but there’s bona 
fide flavor in Harper’s vocals, and 
it makes for an enjoyable listen.

Quite honestly, some of Harp-

er’s stuff sounds destined to be 
covered by the local Potbelly 
cover musician, which isn’t an 
indictment of his sound as much 
as an acceptance of it. For those 
looking for a departure from this 
type of rock, however, Call It 
What It Is still has its moments.

“Bones” showcases Harper’s 

rangy vocals while also revealing 
an appropriate amount of vulner-
ability: “Every now and then I get 
so tired / I rest my bones / sitting 
alone with my desires / in my 
bones.” The song’s general feel 
is in line with the agitated tone 
Harper conveys in other places 
on the album. It fits right in, at 
least as much as anything can on 
a Ben Harper album.

Cohesiveness has never really 

been Harper’s thing, and that 
holds true on Call It What It Is. 
It’s eclectic — controlled mish-
mash at its finest, a rollercoaster 
all the way through. It’s all over 
the place, but it should still man-
age to please.

TV NOTEBOOK
The slow, repetitive 
decline of TV horror

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

The hook of season one for 

MTV’s 
reboot 
of 
“Scream” 

built off the suspense of what 
a slasher flick could offer to 
the small screen. While movies 
must reach resolution by their 
120-minute time allotment, TV 
series carry the ability to drag 
out the suspense over multiple 
weeks. However, MTV’s revival, 
in keeping a story arc similar to 
that of its namesake, has ulti-
mately set up its second season 
for failure.

The horror genre, though 

effective in film, doesn’t trans-
late well into a television show 
(with the notable exception of 
FX’s “American Horror Story”). 
Where MTV’s “Scream” follows 
Wes Craven’s original tetralogy, 
“Horror Story” begins each sea-
son with specific theme in mind, 
such as last season’s “Hotel” 
premise. These new approach-
es could be responsible for the 
upward trend in ratings that the 
season premieres have pulled 
in since its first season, “Mur-
der House,” whose average 3.18 
million views were succeeded 
by 3.85 million from “Asylum,” 
5.54 million from “Coven” and 
6.13 million from “Freakshow.”

With 
the 
exception 
of 

“Hotel”’s slightly lower num-
bers in viewership of 5.81 mil-
lion, the series is ultimately 
responsible 
for 
bringing 
in 

consistently high ratings for 
FX since 2011. These num-
bers sharply juxtapose MTV’s 

“Scream,” whose first season 
was met with divided critical 
response and an opening view-
ership of 1.03 million against 
“Murder House” ’s 3.18 mil-
lion. This discrepancy could be 
a result of MTV’s lack of origi-
nality in their series because 
they’re attempting a revival, 
but regardless, what might have 
been considered passable in the 
first season will certainly not 
survive a second season.

Shows of the supernatural 

and horror genre are espe-
cially at risk of extinction over 
other genres of television, and 
the race to remain relevant is 
a high-stakes challenge. These 
series fight for the audience’s 
attention 
through 
elaborate 

and well-established plotlines, 
which is why “Horror Story” is 
likely so popular. Changing the 
theme stirs up audience atten-
tion, oftentimes allowing for 
a clean slate if interest is too 
easily lost. This theory is not a 
relatively new one, as successful 
television shows often follow a 
different established path dur-
ing each of their seasons. For 
example, during its successful 
early years, “Supernatural” fol-
lowed the pattern of a punctuat-
ed theme followed by resolution 
at the end of the season.

Other shows of this genre fol-

low this same pattern of repeti-
tion without repetition. “Once 
Upon a Time” establishes its 
new direction during the season 
finales; “Orphan Black” deploys 
clever plot twists to keep the 
viewer engaged. The point is, 

they never do the same thing 
twice, which is why MTV’s 
“Scream” is ultimately headed 
towards senseless repetition.

Unoriginal plot and repetition 

has not only led horror revivals 
such as MTV’s “Scream” to an 
early grave, but technology has 
ultimately played a hand in their 
demises, too. The digital age 
has essentially demolished the 
foundations of the horror genre, 
a fact punctuated by scenes 
such as Ariana Grande’s futile 
attempts to send a tweet at the 
time of her demise in FOX’s sat-
ire series “Scream Queens.” The 
original “Scream” is famous for 
the deadly phone calls that were 
used as a tool to propagate fear 
and paranoia for both the char-
acters and audience, a tool that 
does not transpose into a decade 
where “Find My iPhone” exists. 
Intimate landline calls added 
into the suspense and thrill of 
horror flicks in the ’80s and ’90s 
alongside Hitchcockian scores 
and well-developed characters.

Unfortunately 
for 
MTV’s 

revival of “Scream,” we live in 
a decade of sleek screens, elec-
tronically produced music and 
a cast whose flat affect lacks 
conviction. With the rise of the 
gothic genre that characterizes 
shows such as “American Hor-
ror Story” and “Bates Motel,” 
the scarce shows of the hor-
ror variety are slowly creep-
ing towards extinction, and 
probably for good. As for those 
involved in the production of 
television horror, I’d recom-
mend keeping a day job.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
The assassination of 
Tidal by Apple Music

By HARRY KRINSKY

Daily Arts Writer

A few weeks ago, Samsung 

silenced the rumors that it 
would be buying the music 
streaming service Tidal from 
rapper Jay Z. Samsung’s with-
drawal from the deal with Tidal 
is likely the nail in the music 
streaming service’s coffin. Tid-
al’s resume includes accidental-
ly releasing Rihanna’s ANTI a 
few days early, charging people 
for The Life of Pablo before it 
was available, ousting a set of 
top executives, attempting to 
sue Tidal’s previous owner for 
misrepresenting its subscrip-
tion numbers and accumulat-
ing only a tenth of the amount 
of users Spotify has. Plus, if 
you are like me and you pur-
chased the 30-day subscription 
to Tidal exclusively to stream 
Kanye’s TLOP, then you already 
experienced the clunky user 
interface of a product that was 
rolled out too early.

Tidal isn’t terrible. It’s just 

not as good as Spotify and Apple 
Music — the two other applica-
tions that provide the same ser-
vice. It’s hard to search for the 
music you want, it doesn’t seem 
to have as good of playlists and 
it sometimes quits randomly. It 
might just be that I’m used to 
Apple Music, but I can confi-
dently say I had no urge to jump 
ship from Apple Music to Tidal 
(especially with Views From 
The 6 right around the corner).

The Tidal saga is somewhere 

in between a sad story about a 
failing business and a giant, 
expensive joke about Jay Z’s 
hubris. Soon, Tidal will not 
exist. Jay Z will be out some 

hefty chunk of money, and the 
people at Spotify and Apple 
Music will maybe have a little 
“our competition just combust-
ed under the weight of itself” 
party before returning to duke 
it out over T-Swift streaming 
deals and OVO Radio drops. 
Largely, the music industry will 
move on. But Tidal’s death will 
come as a serious missed oppor-
tunity for musicians, especially 
those who are up and coming in 
the new digital music age.

Prior to the digital music 

revolution sparked by Napster, 
record labels snagged artists 
in exploitive record deals and 
profited off the backs of their 
talent. Digital music technology 
shook the music industry to its 
core, cutting profits for all par-
ties involved. In spite of plum-
meting profits, there was hope 
that after the dust settled, the 
artist might be able to gain a bit 
more control over their music. 
The hope was that as it became 
easier and easier for artists 
to promote their own sound, 
the big, bad labels would have 
less leverage. To some extent, 
that has happened, and is hap-
pening; artists from Radio-
head to Lil Yachty are finding 
Internet-based self-promotion 
as more than enough to reach 
their fans. But as Apple Music 
and Spotify get bigger and big-
ger, it’s possible that artists’ 
temporarily-seized power will 
slip from them. Apple Music 
has already offered exclusive 
streaming deals with artists, 
where a given album is released 
on Apple Music before its made 
available publicly. While it may 
mean labels have less control, 
it’s possible the control has just 

shifted to a different group of 
old people in suits with only 
bottom lines on the mind. 
Where does Tidal fit into all 
this? 

Let’s pretend Tidal grows to 

command a significant chunk 
of the music streaming indus-
try (let’s call it 12 million sub-
scribers and rising with the 
industry trend). Jay Z (who, 
in this case, is both a busi-
nessman and a business, man) 
becomes the owner of one of 
the most successful streaming 
services in the world. An art-
ist who came up through the 
innovation-induced earthquake 
that was Napster and the MP3 
would now be at the helm of a 
service that appears to be the 
foreseeable future of music 
distribution. Tidal’s claims to 
be an “artist owned coalition,” 
and its revenue streaming roy-
alty numbers back it up; Tidal 
gives a little less than seven 
times more money in royalties 
per play to its artists than Apple 
Music or Spotify. Tidal also 
offers a high-fidelity stream-
ing option, which streams the 
music as close to the quality 
the artists intended when they 
recorded it as possible.

In an ideal world, Tidal is the 

foil, or at least one ingredient 
in the antidote, to profit-driven 
labels controlling the distribu-
tion of music. In all likelihood, 
Tidal is not going to survive, 
because it’s just a really bad 
business. But a world where 
it did (and where we wouldn’t 
need to watch Taylor Swift’s 
rendition of Drake’s rendition 
of Atlanta rap music on Apple 
ads) would be better for the 
music industry.

I

f you search for one song 
on YouTube, you will find 
hundreds of covers for 

it. It’s amazing. From solos to 
duets to group versions, there 
are so many 
different 
ways people 
adapt a song 
to create 
something 
new and dif-
ferent.

One 

original 
piece of art 
creates an 
array of 
new products — if you search 
for a play or musical, you might 
discover years of revivals 
following its original premiere. 
Art is so complex, and so are 
people. 

There are endless possibilites 

to create products that are both 
passionate and creative, and 
therein lies the versatility of 
art.

You can listen to a song and 

love different things about it 
every time you play. Someone 
looks at the score of that song 
and plays it his or her own 
way. Then someone sings it 
his or her own way. Hence the 
never-ending and unbelievably 
engaging way in which art 
proves its versatility.

There is a lot of debate 

surrounding this idea of 
whether or not an original 
song or piece of art should be 
changed hundreds or even 
thousands of different ways. 
Some think these adaptations 
take away from the original 
song or artist. However, some 
of the best talent I’ve ever seen 
comes from younger artists 
finding inspiration from other 
established artists and creating 
something original from it. 
Shows like “The Voice” or 
“American Idol” are prime 
examples of these artistic 
projects. Singers hear a song, 
and they can make it sound like 
something new by adding their 

own talent and skills.

Versatility, in its simplest 

terms, is the ability for 
something to be adapted into a 
different form or changed. Art 
that looks or sounds one way 
can be turned into something 
different.

Versatility could also be 

defined as the ability to serve 
many uses. This seems, on one 
level, a bit strange considering 
most of us mutually appreciate 
art for its ability to grant 
pleasure and entertainment. 
It’s amazing that it can serve 
a purpose beyond solely 
entertaining an audience. We 
have different reasons for 
choosing certain art — different 
needs, different expectations.

One person might go see 

a show on a Saturday night 
because they are exhausted 
from their week and want to 
relax. Others might go because 
they adore the lead and have 
seen every show that actor has 
starred in. Or, one might see the 
show because 15 years ago they 
saw its opening and they want 
to see how it has changed.

Hence the brilliance of it — 

layered versatility. Art serves 
people differently and it is 
constantly evolving.

I find the versatility of art 

to be an incredible topic to 
explore because it illuminates 
what a privilege it is to engage 
in so many different types of 
art and witness what artists 
produce. It is clear to me that 
this idea extends far beyond 
artists and their craft.

How do we gain versatility 

as students, leaders and 
influencers? There are ways we 
can add more dimension and 
knowledge to what we already 
invest our time into, we just 
need to be willing to find them. 

The emerging challenge 

while creating and innovating 
is fighting the tendencies 
that threaten our ability to be 
versatile. We often fall into 
a rhythm of what we’re good 
at. We find ourselves stuck in 

a safe niche, allowing us to 
encourage our strengths in our 
given talent, while avoiding 
our weaknesses. All of us fight 
versatility by simply remaining 
within the confines of what 
works best for us. We don’t 
always try something new 
or explore new possibilities 
because it is easier to see 
success from what we know we 
can do well.

Many activities we are 

involved with here on campus 
or even in years to come require 
collaboration, which drives us 
toward creativity, because all 
of us have our own strengths 
to contribute. Often the best 
concepts or ideas come from 
people offering what they know 
best and allowing others to 
support what they lack.

It’s beneficial for others if 

we apply our own strengths 
towards our work. But by 
exploring other things outside 
of our realm of comfort, we can 
discover aspects of ourselves 
that complement our existing 
strengths. If you’re a skilled 
leader and find yourself in some 
sort of leadership position, you 
can probably learn the most 
about how to serve in that role 
better by observing someone 
else’s leadership. By putting 
yourself in an environment 
where you don’t lead, but are 
rather being led, you may just 
realize you have something 
different to offer and find room 
for new creativity and growth.

Perhaps the best thing 

we could do for ourselves is 
further explore the concept of 
versatility by acquiring more 
skills and passion towards 
what we already love. Just like 
the covers of popular songs or 
revivals of well-known plays, 
you’ll probably find there are 
hundreds, or even thousands, of 
ways to achieve that.

Snider’s ‘Something 
for the Dark’ at DSO

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

If you look at any genre of 

music, you are almost certain to 
find that it has been informed 
and 
influ-

enced 
by 
at 

least one other 
genre. 
When 

musicians find 
a sound which 
is 
attractive 

to them, they 
imitate 
and 

adapt it into 
their 
own 

work, a natu-
ral step in the 
creative 
pro-

cess. 
Classi-

cal music is 
no 
exception 

to this trend, 
and 
compos-

ers have been 
pulling 
from 

outside genres 
for 
genera-

tions, 
from 

Bartók’s 
use 

of folk song 
to Gershwin’s 
synthesis 
of 

jazz to Piazzolla’s jazzy tango 
infusion.

In the present day, bor-

ders between genres seem to 
be breaking down ever more 
quickly. One of the most excit-
ing genre-blending composi-
tional voices at work today is 
that of Sarah Kirkland Snider, 
whose piece, “Something for 
the Dark,” premiered Thursday 
night with the Detroit Sympho-

ny Orchestra, and will again be 
performed on Friday and Satur-
day.

“As a kid, I was very inter-

ested in music,” Snider said in 
an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. “I came from a non-
musical family — we didn’t have 
any instruments at home or 
anything, so I would go around 
the neighborhood in Princeton, 
which is where I grew up, and 
knock on the doors of neighbors 
and play their pianos by ear.”

Eventually Snider’s grand-

parents provided her family 
with a piano, and she began to 
study piano, cello, voice and a 
little bit of classical guitar. A 
few years later, around the age 
of ten, she also began to com-
pose, a path which has led her 
to become a prominent com-
poser in what some have termed 
indie-classical music.

“I had always made stuff 

up, but I had never written it 
down,” Snider said. “But I didn’t 
show the music to anyone until 
my senior year of high school, 
when my guidance counselor 
said I needed to do that for col-
lege applications.”

Though she used her music as 

part of her college application 
process — which ultimately led 
to her receiving an undergradu-
ate degree from Wesleyan Uni-
versity — Snider didn’t formally 
study composition until much 
later.

“I didn’t actually receive my 

first composition lesson until I 
was 25,” Snider said. “It took me 
a few years after college to real-
ize that I needed to do composi-
tion full time in order to really 
be happy.”

Snider further pursued her 

musical studies at Yale Uni-
versity, where she received her 
master’s degree and an artist’s 
diploma. “Something for the 
Dark” originates from a com-
petition hosted by the Detroit 
Symphony 
Orchestra, 
the 

Elaine 
Lebenbom 
Memorial 

Award for Female Composers.

“I kind of applied for it on 

a whim. It was, like, the day 
before the deadline,” Snider 
said. “I didn’t think that any-
thing would come of it, so it was 
a wonderful surprise to have 
this opportunity.”

Snider began writing the 

piece with a specific emotional 
idea in mind, though the work 
ultimately changed direction 
during the compositional pro-
cess.

“I decided early on, when I 

was thinking about writing this 
piece, that I would try to have 
it somehow loosely musing on 
the idea of hope,” Snider said. “I 
usually need to start with some 
sort of emotional impetus when 
I’m thinking about writing a 
piece.”

Snider also wanted “Some-

thing for the Dark” to pertain in 
some way to the city of Detroit, 
because the commision was for 
the city’s resident orchestra.

“It sounds sort of cliché when 

you’re talking about Detroit, but 
it’s hard not to think about all 
the struggle,” she said. “A good 
friend of mine, Shara Worden — 
the singer who I’d worked with 
on ‘Penelope,’ the song cycle I 
wrote — had moved to Detroit 
a few years prior, and had told 

me a lot about it … and so I was 
thinking about hope, and I had 
this motific idea that felt very 
optimistic, and I was trying to 
figure out what to do with it.”

The hopeful conception of 

the piece gradually began to 
take a darker turn, however, 
and Snider explored several 
areas into which she had not 
anticipated venturing.

“As I started to write the 

piece, it started to go in a dark-
er direction than I intended,” 
Snider said. “I realized that this 
was just the way the piece need-
ed to go, and that perhaps a nar-
rative that begins with this idea 
of optimism but then explores 
some darker areas is not nec-
essarily a hopeless narrative. 
Maybe it’s actually a good nar-
rative, because it’s more realis-
tic and embodies the realities of 
existence.”

For Snider, composition is 

often based on narrative, she 
said. 

“I think of myself as a narra-

tive composer, and I try not to 
think in terms of aesthetics,” 
Snider said. “I feel like when 
I catch myself thinking about 
aesthetics that gets me into 
trouble because it gets me into 
conversations that have more 
to do with dogmatic ideologi-
cal points I was taught in school 
that have more to do with the 
teachers who taught them to me 
… I try to concentrate on telling 
the most compelling musical 
story I can tell.”

She noted that the creation of 

this narrative, however, doesn’t 
come without challenges

“Composition, for me, always 

involves a lot of hair-pulling 
and anxiety, and sweat and 
blood and staying up all night 
fretting,” 
Snider 
said. 
“But 

that’s just the way I think it will 
always be for me. It’s just my 
personality type.”

When asked if there was any-

thing she would like her listen-
ers to know about “Something 
for the Dark,” Snider offered a 
word of caution about adhering 
to a composer’s extra-musical 
ideas for a piece.

“Music is so abstract … I feel 

like if I’ve done my job well, it 
will mean something differ-
ent to every person who hears 
it,” Snider said. “So I’m always 
resistant to projecting too much 
on to either a program note or 
the description of the piece 
… I get nervous about reveal-
ing that, because I don’t want 
to guide a listener too much in 
what to think or feel.”

She later noted in an e-mail 

that a listener might find it 
helpful to know of the origin of 
the piece’s title, a poem called 
“For Fran,” by Detroit-based 
poet Philip Levine, which can 
be read online at the Poetry 
Foundation.

Michigan dance 
groups help Flint

Performance aims 
to bring long-term 
awareness and aid to 

city

By ALLIE SCHOLTEN

Daily Arts Writer

As efforts to aid Flint resi-

dents after the city’s water 
crisis 
continue 
statewide, 

University 
of 

Michigan stu-
dents are band-
ing 
together 

to raise funds 
by 
showcas-

ing the work of 
dance 
groups 

within 
the 

Southeastern 
Michigan com-
munity 
while 

also 
drawing 

attention 
to 

Flint. The event, a show called 
“Tap Water for Flint,” on Sat-
urday will also host various 
yoga, zumba and fitness classes 
leading up to the dance perfor-
mance.

“After hearing about every-

thing that was going on with the 
Flint water crisis, I was kind of 
shocked to hear that there was 
nothing that was really being 
done throughout Michigan, let 
alone on Michigan’s campus,” 
said University alum Meredith 
Njus, one of the organizers 
of the event, said. Performers 

include groups from Ann Arbor, 
Detroit and Flint, including 
Flint’s Tapology Youth Ensem-
ble, as well as the University’s 
own RhythM Tap Ensemble, 
Groove and UM Slam Poetry.

“We want to kind of build an 

alliance, a relationship between 
our communities and a sense 
that we belong to each other,” 
said Christine Convery, School 
of Public Health graduate stu-
dent. “And hopefully … support 
the efforts there to treat the 
effects of the Flint water cri-
sis, but also the causes of it, the 
underlying poverty that’s really 
endemic to that area.”

The event intends to unite 

Southeastern Michigan com-
munities, as well as students on 
campus, in efforts to continue 
aiding the Flint community 
beyond initial relief efforts of 
sending water, and to uplift the 
image of Flint in the media, Dan 
Bator said.

“There’s a lot of bad imagery 

associated with the Flint water 
crisis now, and so the reputa-
tion of Flint is kind of up to be 
decided by people looking in 
on the state,” Bator said. “We 
wanted to shine more light on 
the resiliency and the joy that is 
going on and the passion people 
have for their town and for their 
region.”

By 
highlighting 
perform-

ers within the Flint region, 
“Tap Water for Flint” intends 
to bring the community to the 
stage by allowing them to rep-

resent themselves, to uplift the 
outlook for the city and to unite 
the efforts of various groups.

“I think it’s a reminder to 

both our campus community 
and to the local communi-
ties just saying, ‘we’re all still 
here for Flint,’” Njus said. “It’s 
important to know that we keep 
supporting Flint.”

“Tap Water for Flint” orga-

nizers said they have received 
great support from the per-
formers as well as from local 
Ann Arbor businesses that are 
volunteering their efforts for 
the event. Proceeds will go 
to the Flint Child Health and 
Development Fund, in efforts 
to aid neurological and devel-
opmental issues that may occur 
down the line in Flint children.

“All these Michigan groups 

are showing their love for move-
ment and their passion for the 
community of Flint,” Bator said. 
“The crisis will come and go, 
but the love and support for the 
community is something that 
we hope to continue to share.”

Karas has found the perfect home

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

At the tender age of 2 years old, 

Olivia Karas used to flip off her 
family’s couch.

In an attempt to channel their 

child’s energy in a more controlled, 
less dangerous way, Karas’ parents 
enrolled her in “mommy and me” 
gymnastics classes. At first glance, 
the building where the classes 
were held was just a run-down 
warehouse in Chicago. But for 
Karas, it’s where she began her 
life’s journey as one of the most 
accomplished athletes in college 
gymnastics. 

Four years later at that same 

warehouse, one of the gymnastics 
coaches asked Olivia to try out for 
a team. Karas had a charismatic 
attitude and undeniable talent 
even at that age, and she officially 
made the team at the age of 6.

But after about a month, she 

decided she hated it and quit.

Now, as a member of the 

Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team 12 years later, Karas has 
garnered a long list of honors and 
awards, including All Big-Ten 
first team, Big Ten Freshman of 
the Year and three-time Big Ten 
Gymnast of the Week.

With that impressive haul, it 

seems unbelievable that Karas 
almost didn’t become a gymnast 
at all. After initially quitting 
gymnastics, Karas returned to 
her energetic self, so much so that 
her parents told her she had to do 
something — anything — to settle 
down.

“I was a crazy kid,” Karas said. 

“Eight months after I quit, nothing 
changed and I was still crazy 
because I had so much energy. 
My mom told me, ‘You have to go 
back, you have to do something.’ 
I told her, ‘I kind of want to try 
gymnastics again,’ so I went back 
and I’ve loved it ever since.”

And so she began her path 

toward becoming a successful 

college gymnast. After Karas 
made a trip to the national 
meet as an eighth-grader, she 
received a recruitment letter 
from Michigan. At the time, she 
felt it was too soon to be thinking 
about college, so Karas and her 
family stuck the letter in a box 
and left it alone.

During her sophomore year 

of high school, though, Karas 
realized she was almost late to 
the recruitment process. She 
was injured her freshman year 
and 
remained 
uncommitted. 

Gymnasts all around her were 
already committed, and she had 
almost no idea where she wanted 
to go. Almost.

As it turns out, that letter in a 

box was never forgotten.

“This was always my dream 

place,” Karas said. “I always 
wanted to come to Michigan. My 
friends and I, we would always 
watch 
Michigan. 
We 
never 

watched anyone else compete. 
From then on, I told myself, ‘If I 
go to college for gymnastics, I’m 
going to Michigan.’

“My parents tried to get me to 

branch out, but I wouldn’t have it. 
This was the place. I knew from 
the start, as soon as I walked in 
those doors on my first visit, this 
was the place. I had no interest 
in going anywhere else. This is 
perfect for me.”

Karas committed to Michigan 

just before her junior year and 
stepped on campus this past fall 
ready to do what she had always 
done since the age of 2. 

Coming off of a successful 

high school gymnastics career, 
where she competed with IK 
Gymnastics, Karas was prepared 
for collegiate athletics. Competing 
in events like the Nastia Liukin 
Cup and winning vault two years 
in a row at the J.O. National 
Championships, Karas was clearly 
a good recruitment choice for the 
Wolverines.

One 
thing 
Karas 
didn’t 

anticipate was how welcoming the 
team would be. For her, the team 
has been one of the driving factors 
that keeps her relaxed on the floor.

Karas 
was 
one 
of 
two 

freshmen 
to 
join 
the 
team 

for the 2015-16 season, along 
with Emma McLean. The two 
immediately bonded together — 
at meets, they give pep talks to 
each other. At practice, they’re 

keeping each other loose. And 
while she doesn’t necessarily 
dive off her family’s couches 
anymore, Karas still has that 
energetic attitude that got her 
started in gymnastics in the first 
place, according to McLean.

“Outside of the gym, she’s just 

like she is in the gym,” McLean 
said. “She’s full of energy, very 
spunky. She’s like the Energizer 
Bunny in the commercials. She 
never stops.”

Some freshmen struggle to 

adjust in college, particularly to 
the demanding nature of athletics. 
Karas, 
however, 
apparently 

hasn’t had that problem. Serving 
multiple times as an anchor, she 
has been a consistent name and 
reliable presence in the lineup all 
season long.

The energy Karas had as a 

kid has followed her out of the 
warehouse in Chicago and into the 
gym at Michigan. As a freshman, 
Karas has already made her mark 
on Michigan gymnastics — she 
finished the season ranked among 
the top-10 gymnasts nationally in 
three events: she tied for second 
on beam, seventh on floor and 10th 
in the all-around.

Karas has been a force in the 

all-around, winning the event 
four times in the past season. She 
also has 12 individual titles, eight 
of which were on vault.

It’s clear that Karas’ strong suit 

is vault. She made her college debut 
at the Cancun Classic, where she 
won vault with a 9.925. She also 
received a second-place finish at 
the Big Ten Championships with 
the same score. Her career best 
is a 9.950, and in a meet against 
Eastern Michigan and Maryland, 
one judge even awarded Karas a 
10.0 for the event.

However, one can’t be an all-

around winner just by performing 
well on the vault. Known for her 
energetic floor routines, Karas has 
also racked up three individual 
floor titles this year.

“Seeing her in competition 

and seeing how charismatic she 
is, you just can’t miss her,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. “You 
sit in a gym and you have all of this 
stuff going on around you, but no 
matter where she is in the gym, 
your attention will just be drawn 
to her because of how charismatic 
and dynamic she is.”

There’s no doubt about it, Karas 

is charismatic. She’s still the 
energetic gymnast she was in that 
run-down warehouse in Chicago.

Karas may only be a freshman, 

but she’s a freshman who has been 
consistently leading the pack all 
year. With her accomplishments 
and personality, it’s clear that 
the little girl who used to flip 
off couches has exceeded all 
expectations.

Freshman Olivia Karas briefly stopped doing gymnastics at age 6, but she has stuck with it since then and earned Big Ten Freshman of the Year honors this season.

Reviewing Michigan’s season

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team was up, down, 
up, down and up again this year. 
What started as a record-tying 
undefeated streak turned into 
a forgettable stretch of losses, 
followed by a predictable Big 
Ten season, a setback in the 
conference tournament and a late 
postseason run.

Yet at the end of it all, the 

season finished as many would 
have expected. On the brink 
of the NCAA Tournament, the 
Wolverines’ (9-9 Big Ten, 21-14 
overall) hopes were cut short, but 
they stepped up in the WNIT for a 
second consecutive year.

The 
Daily 
recaps 
the 

highlights and lowlights of the 
2015-16 season.

Best 
game: 
Michigan 
77, 

Temple 76

The best game of the year 

arrived late. Michigan battled 
Temple in the quarterfinal of the 
WNIT for a Final Four berth, 
which both teams had achieved 
the year before. Temple led by 
15 early on, but the Wolverines 
rallied in the second half to 
close the gap. Down to the wire, 
the game witnessed 12 lead 
changes in the fourth quarter. 
The Wolverines trailed by only 
one, and the game’s final scoring 
chance came for Michigan. The 
team executed to come out on top 
— more on that later.

Worst game: Eastern Michigan 
64, Michigan 63

For their final game before 

tipping off Big Ten season, the 
Wolverines traveled down the 
road to Eastern Michigan for 
what was supposed to be an 
easy win. Last season, Michigan 
won by 29, but on Dec. 23, the 
Wolverines lost all momentum 
before conference play.

Missed 
free 
throws 
were 

the 
difference 
maker. 
With 

the chance to tie or take the 
lead, freshman center Hallie 
Thome blanked on back-to-back 
attempts from the line, and the 

Eagles ran out the clock to stun 
the Wolverines.

Best individual performance: 
Madison Ristovski in the WNIT

While 
sophomore 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty was usually 
the one putting up points, senior 
guard Madison Ristovski had 
perhaps the best performance by 
any player during a four-game 
stretch in the WNIT. Ristovski 
scored 
19 
points 
with 
nine 

rebounds in the quarterfinal 
against Temple, and she played 
a crucial role in leading the 
Wolverines as far as they went.

Ristovski’s career at Michigan 

ended in a semifinal loss at 
Florida Gulf Coast, and despite 
three straight years in the 
WNIT, Ristovski did get a taste 
of the NCAA Tournament her 
freshman year. In the opening 
round of the Big Dance, she 
played nine minutes against 
then-No. 1 Stanford. Her role 
grew over the years, and she 
went out on a high note, having 
been named to the WNIT All-
Tournament team.

Most important game: Iowa 97, 
Michigan 85

The Wolverines had a chance 

to advance past the opening 
round of the Big Ten Tournament 
and possibly boost their NCAA 
Tournament 
chances 
against 

Iowa, a team with which they split 
the season series.

After Thome and Michigan 

clobbered 
the 
Hawkeyes 
in 

the paint early, a few defensive 
adjustments by Iowa shut Thome 
down after the first quarter, 
and the Hawkeyes stuffed the 
Wolverines’ hopes of making the 
Big Dance.

Play of the year: Thome’s 
game-winner against Temple

Late in the game against 

Temple, Michigan was down, 
76-75. With under a minute left, 
the Wolverines bounced four 
shots off the rim and grabbed each 
offensive rebound. On their fifth 
and final attempt, Thome grabbed 
her own board and scored the 

go-ahead, game-clinching basket 
to advance them to the semifinals.

Most valuable player: Katelynn 
Flaherty

This one is easy. Flaherty, 

a sophomore guard, was an 
honorable mention All-American 
and first team All-Big Ten. Among 
the nation’s top-10 scorers, she 
lived up to — and often exceeded — 
the hype surrounding her second 
campaign. Flaherty’s 22.1 points 
per game earned her the all-time 
single-season scoring record for 
Michigan women’s basketball.

Flaherty 
stepped 
into 
the 

spotlight this season after three 
key seniors — who accounted 
for more than 50 percent of the 
scoring and rebounds — graduated 
and moved on. Flaherty rarely 
staggered, though, and had one of 
the best individual seasons, if not 
the best season, of any Wolverine 
in school history.

Up next: Michigan 
coach 

Kim Barnes Arico begins her 

fifth season at the helm in 2016-
17, which means her impact is 
starting to take shape. Barnes 
Arico will have fully recruited 
each player on the roster next 
year, and if the success of the 
current underclassmen is any 
indicator, things are looking up.

Players like Thome and Flaherty 

made immediate contributions, 
but many underclassmen with 
smaller roles stepped up as well. 
Freshman guards Boogie Brozoski 
and Nicole Munger each had 
special moments, and sophomore 
forward Jillian Dunston also 
fought for key minutes.

Each class continues to bring 

more talent than the previous one. 
Joining the roster next year from 
Benton Harbor, Mich., is guard 
Kysre Gondrezick, who shattered 
the Michigan high school scoring 
record this year in a 72-point 
outing that included 10 3-pointers 
on 27-for-54 shooting. The class 
is ranked No. 13 by Prospects 
Nation and No. 20 by HoopGurlz. 
Regardless, there will be new 
talent in Ann Arbor next fall.

Michigan battles 
Buckeyes for first

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan versus Ohio State. 

As supporters of both schools 
know, it doesn’t get any bigger 
than that. The 
connotation 
is understood, 
and 
the 

ensuing battle 
is expected to 
be fierce and 
relentless. 

While 
any 

series between 
the Wolverines 
and Buckeyes 
carries 
an 
added 

significance, 
when it shifts 
to the softball 
diamond this weekend, this one 
carries even more meaning than 
a heated rivalry could muster 
alone.

No. 2 Michigan (8-2 Big Ten, 

30-4 overall) is set to take on 
No. 23 Ohio State (9-1-1, 25-8-1) 
in a battle for first place in the 
Big Ten.

Both teams are equipped 

with potent offenses that have 
powered their successful seasons. 
The Wolverines rank second 
nationally in scoring average, 
third in on-base percentage and 
fourth in slugging percentage 
and home runs per game.

The Buckeyes rank near the 

top of the conference in multiple 
offensive categories as well, 
staking claim to a .322 batting 
average, 292 runs scored, 48 
home runs and a .424 on-base 
percentage.

But Michigan’s bats have 

cooled off lately. The Wolverines 
scored just 13 runs against 
Nebraska last weekend after 
posting more than double that 
amount with 31 against Indiana 
the weekend before.

The offense will need to 

rediscover 
its 
earlier 
form, 

especially since Ohio State boasts 
a stingy pitching staff. Buckeye 

pitcher Shelby Hursh has a 2.09 
ERA with 109 strikeouts in 90.1 
innings pitched, and pitcher 
Lena Springer has a 2.73 ERA in 
43.2 innings pitched.

If Michigan needed a practice 

run to prepare for the type of 
challenge the Buckeyes present, 
its 3-0 win over Michigan 
State Wednesday could serve 
as an important lesson. The 
Wolverines 
gained 
valuable 

experience scraping together a 
victory in a close contest despite 
early struggles at the plate.

As 
junior 
third 
baseman 

Lindsay Montemarano pointed 
out, the Wolverines need games 
like the one against the Spartans 
to prove they are capable of 
sticking together to pull out a 
narrow win even if their offense 
doesn’t score in the manner it is 
accustomed to.

“We do a really good job of, 

no matter what type of game 
we’re in, we try to keep the same 
process and try not to put too 
much pressure (on ourselves) 
even if it’s a close game or we’re 
ahead by a lot,” Montemarano 
said. “(Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins) always says, ‘Don’t give 
at-bats away, because you don’t 
know how many at-bats you’re 
going to have left in the season.’ ”

After motivating her team 

to victory over Michigan State 
with a particularly impassioned 
huddle before the Wolverines’ 
fifth-inning 
rally, 
Hutchins 

knows it will be up to the players 
to decide the outcome of the 
series against Ohio State.

“We’re 
really 
capable 
of 

taking on the challenge, but we 
have to be excited about the 
challenge and not afraid of it,” 
Hutchins said. “They’re coming 
here to beat us, so I hope we go 
on the field to beat them. It’s a 
battle. … You have to attack the 
challenge.”

It’s Michigan versus Ohio 

State in a battle for first place 
in the Big Ten. The Wolverines 
shouldn’t 
need 
any 
more 

motivation than that.

Senior captain 
continues to lead 
Wolverines in pool 
and in classroom

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

It’s not often that a water polo 

player is compared to seven-
time 
Pro 
Bowl 
cornerback 

Darrelle Revis. But for Michigan 
coach Marcelo Leonardi, it was 
the 
perfect 
comparison 
for 

senior Ali Thomason. 

Thomason has put together 

a strong campaign for the No. 6 
Michigan women’s water polo 
team. She leads the team in goals 
scored and ranks second on 
the team in assists. But what’s 
more impressive is her ability to 
consistently improve during her 
time as a Wolverine. In each of 
her four years, Thomason has 
broken her previous season’s 
goal count, and this season, she 
is just 15 goals away from tying 
the school record of 84. 

As a second-year captain, 

Thomason’s job is to be a leader, 
and to do so she has to set an 
example in all that she does. She 
has to be the best attacker. She 
has to be the best student. She 
has to be the role model for the 
rest of the team. 

Thomason’s water polo career 

at Michigan took a turn after 
her sophomore season, when 
the Wolverines hired Leonardi. 
Prior to his arrival, Thomason 
was primarily a defensive player 
and had scored just 57 goals in 
her first two years combined. In 
her first season with Leonardi, 
she scored 58. 

After he saw her play, he knew 

immediately that she needed 
to be part of the offense, not 
just the defense. He found a 
way to incorporate her on both 
sides of the pool, which allowed 
her to elevate her goal-scoring 

ability while maintaining a high 
number of steals. 

It takes an impressive skill 

set to score as many goals as she 
does, but Thomason also uses her 
keen athleticism in the pool. This 
season, she has won 90 percent 
of her sprints, often putting her 
in prime position to score. 

“She has a very unique style of 

play,” said fellow senior captain 
Kelly Martin. “No matter if one 
person is guarding her or three 
people are guarding her, she is 
always able to get a shot off.” 

This brings it back to the 

Darrelle 
Revis 
comparison, 

which Leonardi made as a 
testament to her athleticism. At 
first, it might seem like a stretch 
to compare the 
two. One plays 
on a grass field, 
the other plays 
in a pool. One 
plays 
defense 

and the other 
is an attacker. 
But they are 
similar 
in 

how they both 
require 
so 

much attention 
from the other team, providing 
their own team with more 
opportunities. 

“You put her (in one area of 

the pool) and we don’t need 
help,” Leonardi said. “On the 
opposite spectrum, the other 
team has to help because she is 
that good. She can cover so much 
water and put so much pressure 
on both sides of the pool because 
of her athleticism.” 

But 
Thomason 
wants 
her 

impact to transcend her play in 
the pool. She is not afraid to do 
the little things to make a team 
run smoothly. From motivating 
before a tough practice to laying 
lane lines after practice, she has 
become a role model for others 
on the team. 

When Leonardi took over, 

he introduced three pillars for 
the team: culture, teamwork 

and 
leadership. 
When 
he 

presented the team with the new 
philosophy, Thomason was one 
of the first to buy in. 

“Change is always difficult,” 

Thomason said. “It’s a whole 
new system. From the beginning 
I believed in what Marcelo was 
doing and I bought into it and 
really tried to get other girls 
who weren’t as sure to buy into 
it. I think that’s a big thing that 
has led to our success, especially 
this year.” 

Leonardi’s second task as 

the new coach was to name 
captains. 
The 
team 
had 
a 

tradition of naming captains for 
the following season at the end 
of the current season; however, 

he felt this was 
too early. So he 
waited. 
And 

waited. 
And 

waited. 

Finally, 
a 

couple 
weeks 

prior 
to 
the 

start 
of 
the 

season, 
he 

named seniors 
Danielle 
Robinson and 

Elizabeth Williams, along with 
Thomason, as captains. Though 
she was a junior, he felt she was 
a perfect fit for the role, both for 
the upcoming season as well as 
heading into the future. 

“Knowing I only had those 

seniors for very little time, I 
felt I need to develop a captain 
in training, and Ali would have 
been the perfect fit,” Leonardi 
said. 

But 
as 
a 
junior 
captain, 

Thomason initially was hesitant 
in finding her place as a team 
leader. 

“I wasn’t the most confident 

leader and (the seniors) were 
showing me the ropes of how 
to truly run a team, how to 
deal 
with 
conflict, 
how 
to 

communicate best,” Thomason 
said. “By being a leader last year, 
everything they taught me and 

everything Marcelo taught me 
has crossed over to me helping 
the other captains this year.” 

Her ability to be a leader 

through teaching others plays 
a significant role on the team, 
as the rest of the team looks to 
emulate her actions both in and 
out of the pool. 

Though her confidence has 

grown in her second year as 
captain, it is not to be mistaken 
for 
arrogance. 
Leonardi 
is 

continuously 
impressed 
by 

her humble nature. Thomason 
does not have her eyes set on 
her own personal records or 
accomplishments. To her, those 
feats are just ways to help the 
team reach its ultimate goal of 
winning games and being the 
best it can be. 

“She is the perfect combination 

of the best player on the team 
with a big slice of humble pie,” 
Leonardi said. 

When Thomason is outside of 

Canham Natatorium, her life as a 
student is just as important to her 
as her life as a college athlete. She 
is studying neuroscience with 
a minor in writing. Though her 
NCAA eligibility expires after 
this season, she still has another 
semester before graduating and 
will be conducting research this 
summer. 

It is no secret that being a 

student-athlete 
is 
difficult, 

especially at Michigan. Though 
it can be tough to balance 
sports and academics, she never 
questioned her choice to become 
a 
Wolverine. 
To 
Thomason, 

Michigan provided her with the 
perfect combination of athletics 
and academics. 

“You 
won’t 
see 
anything 

at 
any 
other 
schools 
like 

Michigan,” 
Thomason 
said. 

“We have absolutely amazing 
athletic 
facilities, 
and 
we 

also have absolutely amazing 
academic facilities and athletes 
are held to such high academic 
standards.”

Thomason has taken what 

she has learned from being a 
leader in the pool and used it 
in the classroom. Just as she is 
dependable for her teammates, 
she 
is 
dependable 
for 
her 

classmates as well. 

Thomason works with two 

other students in a writing 
workshop, and her professor 
Cody Walker said she was 
dependent and always someone 
he knew he could expect to be 
ready when needed. 

Much 
like 
Leonardi, 

Walker 
was 
also 
impressed 

by her humble character and 
willingness to help others. He 
sees her leadership skills play 
out in the classroom, just as they 
might in the pool. 

“You would never know she is 

a star of the team,” Walker said. 
“She doesn’t carry herself that 
way. She is going to let that work 
do the talking and she is not 
going to talk about herself. She’s 
a really good citizen within the 
workshop.”

Though 
she 
takes 
her 

schooling seriously, she is still 
determined to finish the season 
strong for the Wolverines. She 
wants to prove that Michigan is 
a powerhouse in water polo, and 
hopes to bring a championship 
back to Michigan, something 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
never 

done. Perhaps, then, it would 
be apparent just how important 
Thomason’s leadership has been.
