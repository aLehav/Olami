Rape allegedly
occurred in
off-campus
parking lot
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editor
A female student has report-
ed that she was raped early
Sunday morning by a taxi driv-
er in an off-campus parking lot.
University Police released a
crime alert Sunday afternoon
alerting students to the alleged
incident, which was reported
by Ann Arbor Police.
A student was picked up by
an "unknown taxi" from the
1200 block of South University
Avenue at 2 a.m. Sunday morn-
ing, according to the.alert. The
alert notes that the driver was
supposed to take the student
back to her off-campus apart-
ment, but instead took her to a
parking lot located on the 300
block of East Madison, where

he allegedly raped her.
AAPD describes the driver as
a white male with brown hair.
AAPD officials were unable to
release any additional informa-
tion as of Sunday evening.
This is the second rape
reported to police this term.
Holly Rider-Milkovich, the
director of the University's
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, said in a Jan.
interview that resources are
available for all those impacted
by sexual violence in the com-
munity.
"SAPAC is for everyone inthe
University community," Rider-
Milkovich said. "We focus spe-
cifically 'on providing support
to survivors of sexual assault,
intimate partner violence, sex-
ual harassment and stalking,
as well as family members and
friends who are also impacted."
She added: "We realize when
these things happen in our com-
munity, it impacts everybody
around the incident, not just
the survivor. We're here for all
members of the community."

MHacks overtakes
PennApps in student
participation

Daily Staff Reporter
For 36 hours they invaded
Palmer Commons.
Power strips and ethernet

cords were forms of curren-
cy, wall sockets were a prized
resource, staffers with walk-
ie-talkie ear pieces controlled
access in and out of the building
and sleep was sacrificed as blood-
shot eyes stared into computer
screens.
More than 500 students came
to the University from across the
United States and even Canada to
attend MHacks, which was the

largest college hackathon in the
nation - despite being the first
major app-building event hosted
by the University.
Students from a wide array of
schools and fields of study took
hold of rooms, hallways, nooks
and any space in Palmer Coin-
mons within a few feet of a power
outlet to develop programs and
apps for smartphones and lap-
tops.

"It was an epic experience,"
said its director, David Fontenot.
"Everything was over the top."
The marathon event, called
MHacks; started and ended with
presentations in an auditorium
of the Chemistry Building. Fon-

sophomore, described the final
ceremony as "a little rough," but

InterVarsity
claims it was
kicked off campus
for religious values
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
and
ARIANA ASSAF
Daily News Editor
and Daily Staff Reporter
The University has denied
allegations that a student
group was kicked off campus
as a result of the club'sbylaws,
which are perceived by some
to be discriminatory.
The University's Asian
InterVarsity chapter of the
InterVarsity Christian Fel-
lowship, a non-denomina-
tional, evangelical campus
ministry, claimed Thursday
that it was "kicked off" cam-
pus because of religious
qualifications for its student
leaders in the InterVarsity's
Doctrinal Basis and Chapter
Covenant, which do not allow
the admittance of gay or les-
bian members.
Contrary to the organi-
zation's claim, University

spokesperson Kelly Cunning-
ham said in a statement that
the student organization did
not complete its annual re-
registration process by the
Sept. 30 deadline, a require-
ment of all student organiza-
tions.
She said the University
discussed this issue with the
Asian InterVarsity chapter in
December, but the group has
yet to complete the process.
Cunningham said the
University "looks forward"
to working with the student
organization to complete
its registration process and
remain on campus.
"We value the existence of
the Asian InterVarsity Chris-
tian Fellowship," Cunning-
ham said. "Their existence
and their voices add signifi-
cantly to our academic com-
munity and support those
students who find solace,
camaraderie, and guidance in
their presence."
Greg Jao, an InterVarsity
national field director, said
the University's statement is
"factually inaccurate" and
the reason the chapter has
not submitted its constitutiots

'Physical color' is
greener, safer than
traditional products
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily Staff Reporter
In the near future, print media
technology may not produce
products that appear very dif-
ferent than what we're used to,
but under the surface there could
be major improvements thanks
to a new form of color produc-
tion developed by University
researchers.
The technology, known in the
scientific community as "physical
color," allows for the production
of color images without any ink,
dyes or chemicals of any kind.
Jay Guo, electrical engineer-
ing and computer science pro-
fessor and head of the research
lab, said the innovation holds the
potential to drastically change
the way images are printed.

teams develop and
present businesses
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
Fifty-fourhours. That'showlong
it took for 12 teams to each build a
business from the ground up.
In its third year in Ann Arbor,
the MPowered Startup Week-
end took place in the Rackham
Graduate School building this

weekend. Over a span of three
days, the event brought students
together with professionals to
develop business solutions.
The weekend is a global effort
aimed to encourage and facilitate
the coalescence of novice entre-
preneurs to build a business in
54 hours. MPowered, a student
organization created in order to
advocate student entrepreneur-
ship, organized the event.
On Friday evening, all Start-
up Weekend participants were
given the opportunity to pitch
business proposals for potential

start-ups. By late evening, 55
pitches were brought forward
and participants voted on their
favorites. Then, teams were built
around the 12 winning pitches.
Though pitches this year tend-
edto be mainly for technology
products, other pitches included
a non-profit venture to help feed
impoverished children.
Business sophomore Lorenzo

competition, noted that though

sexual assault on campus

Tour bus collided
with a pickup truck
on rural highway
YUCAIPA, Calif. (AP) - A
tour bus crashed with a pickup
truck on a rural mountain high-
way in Southern California on
Sunday night, killing eight peo-
ple and injuring dozens of others,
authorities said.
The collision happened

around 6:30 p.m. and included
the tour bus, a pickup truck pull-
ing a trailer, and a sedan, said
CHP Officer Mario Lopez. He
confirmed late Sunday that eight
people died and many more were
injured in the mountain highway
crash about 80 miles east of Los
Angeles near the town of Forest
Falls.

ries varied from minor to life-
threatening.
People were being extricated
from the bus more than an hour
after the crash on a mountainous
stretch of two-lane Highway 38,
and rescuers were still searching
the wreckage for victims hours
later. Television footage showed
the bus sittingupright but turned
sideways on the road.
Sherwin did not know where
the bus was headed or how the
truck was involved. Highway
38 leads to Big Bear, a popu-
lar area that's home to a ski
resort and other recreational
locations.
At least seven ambulances
were called to the scene, and
patients were taken to several
hospitals.
The injured were rushed to
several area hospitals.
Arrowhead Regional Medi-
cal Center said four women
had been admitted from the
crash and their conditions
were still being determined.
Redland Community Hospi-
tal said it received one person
in critical condition and one
with minor injuries, while
two more were en route with
minor injuries. Community'
Hospital of San Bernardi-
no said it had received one
patient with undetermined
injuries, while St. Bernadine
Medical Center said it had
two patients, whose injuries
were being assessed.

Students to kick
off initiative at
Mock Rock
By CASSANDRA BALFOUR
Daily StaffReporter
One in four women and one in
ten men will experience sexual
assault during their four years in
college.
Armed with these statistics,
the support of various University
departments and their own per-
sonalized networks and talents,
four seniors are undertaking a
sexual assault awareness cam-
paign called "I Will," which will
be unveiled Monday at the annual
student athlete charity event,
Mock Rock.
Their goal is to help educate and
empower the community to stop
what is characterized as a "silent
epidemic"across college campuses.
With guidance and backup
from the Sexual Assault Prevent
and Awareness Center, the Office
of Student Conflict Resolution
andtheAthletic Department, LSA
seniors Elisabeth Hindert, Josh
Buoy, Seth Klapman and Yonah
Liebermam - who is a former
Daily columnist - are launching a
series of public service announce-
ments at campus events and on
the campaign's website, which
also debuts Monday.
They'll also be facilitating
short workshops and targeting
student groups to raise aware-
ness. In addition, they're teaming
up with the Athletic Department
to design teal-colored Adidas
Michigan gear, the symbolic color
of sexual assault awareness.
"What we're trying to do is
start a conversation around sex-
ual assault because it's absent on
this campus; it's absent national-
ly," Buoy said. "It's a taboo topic,
and it's so pressing."
Citing the viral "It Gets Bet-
ter" campaign aimed at isolated
LGBTQ teens and the pink-hued
Breast Cancer Awareness cam-
paigns, the group hopes to adopt
similar methods in order to edu-

cate the entire campus commu-
nity about sexual assault. They
want to create a safe environment
for survivors of sexual assault and
allies alike.
Buoy emphasized that the
group doesn't want to point fin-
gers or blame anyone.
"Sexual assault and violence
takes so many forms beyond rape,
and that's what we really want to
do - we really want to educate -
what qualifies as sexual assault,
because I think so many people,
especially of the male gender,
don't know what it is," Buoy said.
"With this campaign, we're work-
ingwith everyone where theysare."
The group of seniors, brought
together through chance, a
shared goal and, in the case of
the three boys, a shared fresh-
man residence hall, are focusing
on education and dialogue. As a
result of social media campaigns,
events and film shorts shot by the
student group Filmic, which Buoy
heads as a co-creative director,
they're hoping the whole campus
will be awash in teal come spring.
Hindert's ties to the athletic
community as a former student
athlete who now works for the
athletic department helped the
group get the involvement of the
University's athletic community.
They're planning to display their
sexual assault awareness posters
at the Big House, Crisler Arena
and Yost Arena with the hopes
of tying together sexual assault
awareness with some of the Uni-
versity's most visible students.
"Imagine Tim Hardaway Jr.
slam-dunking the basket and he
has a teal bracelet on," Buoy said.
"Then you have on the poster
his 'I Will' statement, so you see
how that campus icon is makinga
commitment to this pause."
Although the group acknowl-
edges that male student ath-
letes are statistically more likely
to commit sexual assault, they
emphasized that sexual assault
is a college-wide issue and that
they're addressing the whole
community and not singling one
demographic out.
LSA sophomore Carly Manes,

president of Students for choice,
said her organization plans to par-
ticipate in the "I Will" workshops.
She said student groups will craft
their own "I Will" statement that
will articulate a tangible goal for
what the organization is planning
to do to stop sexual assault.
"We want tobe a part of giving
women and men who were sexu-
ally assaulted or people who are
allies the tools to combat that in
their communities and in their
own lives," Manes said.
The group aims to change how
students discuss sexual assault.
They want to challenge con-
ventional wisdom that teaches
women and men not to getsexu-
ally assaulted and steer the con-
versation toward teaching people
not to sexually assault others.
"It comes down to the bare
minimum of you can't grab a girls
butt," Hindert said. "Or, what
she's wearing doesn't define who
she is."
A recent University Police
crime alert reported that there
have been unconfirmed occur-
rences of students at off-cam-
pus parties having their drinks
spiked with drugs. Both Buoy
and Hindert said many of their
acquaintances blamed the woman
for drinking too heavily.
"That's the prime example of
the conversation that we want to
remedy, we want people to see
that crime alert and say,. 'Yes,
that's an issue' not 'Why would
she drink so much?"' Buoy said.
"A friend of mine said, 'Sounds to
me girls just shouldn't be drink-
ing drinks that people hand
them,' and that was a girl who
said that. That's the rape culture
that we live in."
Hindert added that blaming
survivors of sexual assault is still
common and that it's that attitude
that the "I Will" campaign aims
to combat on multiple fronts.
"When people hear those sta-
tistics they're really blown away,"
Hindertsaid. "But wejustwantto
get the point across that those sta-
tistics are your roommates, your
teammates, your classmates and
your friends."

"failed to heed signs" warning of
the height limit and will likely be
cited for an overheight violation.

Thefederalgovernment'spush

low achieving schools has led to
takeovers by charter operators,
overhauls of staff and curricu-

across the country.
It's also generated a grow-

Some residents see the reforms
as not only disruptive in strug-
gling neighborhoods, but also as
civil rights violations since turn-

after he accused protesters of
undressing and assaulting him.
The beating was caught on

and the video was broadcast
live on Egyptian television late
Friday as protests raged in the
streets outside the presidential
palace. The AP video showed

The president's office said it was
pained by the images and called
the assault "shocking."

Activist calls
for increased
prison reform

Speaker says current
system stands as
new form of slavery
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
DailyStaffReporter
Late Friday evening, Robert
King, a former member of the
Black Panther Party, spoke to
a crowded room in Rackham
Auditorium on what he said are
the inequities of the American
criminal justice system and the
prison-industrial complex.
King, weathered and soft-
spoken, has spent much of his
life in the corrections system, 29
in solitary confinement.
To speak about prison reform,
he has traveled to 20 different
countries and 47 states to speak
about prison reform. He also has
spoken about the need to release
Albert Woodfox and Herman
Wallace, both of whom are still
being held in an Angola in soli-
tary confinement after 36 years
for the alleged murder of a pris-
on guard. Woodfox, Wallace
and King, the subjects of several
documentaries, are collectively
known as the Angola Three.
King said that his experience
growing up in New Orleans in
the 1950s was an experience in
systematic racism:
"Igrewup in aculture orsoci-
ety where some people where
considered second-class citi-
zens," King said. "Every person
of color was considered a suspect
when a crime was committed."
As a black 22-year-old with
time served, King became the
suspect for a local robbery soon
after release from a stint in pris-
on. Despite not matching the
description of the perpetrator,
he was arrested and eventually
sentenced to 35 years in prison..
"I felt that the system, to put
it in a six-letter word, was rot-
ten," King said. "I began to see
that it was time to take matters
into my own hands ... I was not
against the system, the system
was against me."
King escaped from prison
once and when he was recap-
tured, King said he began his
involvement with the Black Pan-
ther Party because it advocated
for reform of the criminal jus-
tice system and for unequivocal
equal treatment of black people.
Reflecting on his time in

Angola, King said the prison sys-
tem was comparable to slavery
in the manner in which it dehu-
manized him and other inmates.
"I don't think people really
understand the impactof prisons
... there is a little bit of madness
in prison," he said. "All parts of
prison demoralize and dehu-
manize."
King said he survived prison
because he became politicized

strove not to let the prison sys-
tem impact his mental health as
it did for so many others in soli-
tary confinement.
"I was impacted by Angola. I
must admit that everybody was
to some degree," he said. "(But)
I was determined not to let it
impact me the way it impacted
other people."
Law School student Gabe
Newland, symposium direc-
tor for the Michigan Journal of
Race and Law, helped organize
the event with student group
Human Rights Through Educa-
tion. The event was a prelude to
a symposium on solitary confine-
ment that was held Saturday.
Newland said King was
brought to speak because of the
growing discussion in the pris-
on-reform movement on how
solitary confinement constitutes
cruel and unusual punishment.
He added that many states are
coming around to eliminating
solitary confinement as a cost-
saving measure.
"(We wanted) to bring togeth-
er people who look at this prob-
lem from different angles,"
Newland said.
Reform of the prison system is
something that will benefit soci-
ety as a whole, he added.
"I think all of us have a stake in
what's going on here," Newland
said. "What we do to people who
we are punishing for crimes says a
lot about who we are as a society."
LSA junior Ciarra Ross said
she was appreciative of the event
because of how it fit in with the
current LSA theme semester
"Understanding Race."
"It was definitely necessary
... I definitely appreciate it quite
a bit," Ross said.
Ross said she agreed with
King's description of the pris-
on system as a continuation of
slavery.
"Slavery has just taken a new
form and this is a reality that
slavery still exists."

Bus driver fatally shot

. Details emerge
about 65-year-old
alleged shooter
MIDLAND CITY, Ala. (AP)
- As an Alabama standoff
and hostage drama marked a
sixth day Sunday, more details
emerged about the suspect at
the center, with neighbors and
officials painting a picture of an
isolated man estranged from his
family.
Authorities say Jim Lee
Dykes, 65 - a decorated Viet-
nam-era veteran known as
Jimmy to neighbors - gunned
down a school bus driver and
abducted a 5-year-old boy from
the bus, taking him to anunder-
ground bunker on his rural
property. The driver, 66-year-
old Charles Albert Poland Jr.,
was buried Sunday.
Dykes, described as a loner
who railed against the govern-
ment, lives up a dirt road out-
side this tiny hamlet north of
Dothan in the southeastern
corner of the state. His home is
just off the main road north to
the state capital of Montgomery,
about 80 miles away.
The FBI said in a statement
Sunday that authorities con-
tinue to have an open line of
communication with Dykes.
The little boy requested Cheez-
Its and a red Hot Wheels car,
both of which were delivered
to the bunker, a separate state-
ment said. Authorities had said
they also were delivering medi-
cine and other comfort items,
and that Dykes was making the

child as comfortable as possible.
In the nearby community of
Ozark on Sunday, more than
500 people filed into the Civic
Center to pay a final tribute to
Poland, who was being hailed
as a hero for protecting the
other children on the school bus
before he was shot Tuesday.
Poland is now "an angel who
is watching over" the little
boy, said Dale County School
Superintendent Donny Bynum,
who read letters written by
three students who had ridden
on Poland's bus. "You didn't
deserve to die but you died
knowing you kept everyone
safe," one child wrote.
Outside the funeral, school
buses from several counties
lined the funeral procession
route. The buses had black rib-
bons tied to their side mirrors.
Dykes grew up in the Dothan
area. Mel Adams, a Midland
City Council member who owns
the lot where reporters are gath-
ered, said he has known Dykes
since they were ages 3 and 4.
He said Dykes has a sister
and a brother, but that he is
estranged from his family.
Adams said he didn't know
what caused the falling-out, but
that he knew Dykes "had told
part of his family to go to hell."
Midland City Mayor Virgil
Skipper said Dykes' sister is in a
nursing home. Adams said that
law enforcement officers have
talked to Dykes' family mem-
bers and advised them not to
speak with reporters, and that
officers told his sister there was
nothing she could do to help the
child in the bunker.

ast week, reports surfaced that the University had revoked
the Asian InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's designation as
an official student organization, a move group members and
the media called discriminatory. According to the club, a non-denom-
inational campus ministry, the University kicked the group off cam-
pus due to AIVCF's policy requiring those seeking leadership to sign a
statement confirming their Christianity. The University denied these
claims in a statement released Friday, saying the club wasn't removed,
but instead had neglected annual registration deadlines. While the
University may not have ousted AIVCF, the club's constitution violates
nondiscriminatory policies and prevents students from participating in
leadership roles. If the club truly wants to maintain a "spirit of open-
ness," AIVCF should modify their constitution and give all students
the opportunity to get involved in the organization.

When people try
so hard and still
can't get ahead, they
deserve our help.
There are several ways we can
help. We can volunteer. We can
review the facts and the poli-
cies being proposed to solve the
problem and hold our lawmakers
accountable. At the very least, we
can "just start talking about it," as
advocates for the poor have called
for Obama to do. Particularly after
the 2012 election, politicians are
paying attention to our generation's
opinions and advocacy efforts. As
Millenials, we should raise aware-
ness of this issue everywhere we
can and show that we're united in
our concern.
Michigan's poor residents are
part of our larger Michigan fam-
ily. Poor Americans are part of our
larger American family. And Mich-
igan's poor children might be part
of our University family someday.
Family members look out for each
other - we should never forget that.

The University's nondiscrimination policy
clearly states that Michigan "is committed to a
policy of equal opportunity for all persons and
does not discriminate onthe basis of... religion."
Preventing non-Christians from occupying
leadership positions is therefore discrimination
according to the University's policy, regardless
of the nature of the student organization laid
out in the AIVCF statement of purpose. Remov-
ing the group's campus affiliation reaffirms the
University's commitment to nondiscrimina-
tion. AIVCF was also informed in December
that there was a problem with their constitu-
tion and that they would need to revise it, and
so far the group has failed to do so.
However, there are two other InterVarsity
groups currently recognized by the Univer-
sity whose constitutions include a statement
of faith requirement for student leaders, sim-
ilar to AIVCF's constitution. This indicates
that the Center for Campus Involvement, the
arm of the University that deals with student
organization applications, needs to ensure
that it consistently applies its policies across
all student organizations. It should pay par-
ticular attention to member and leadership
selection processes, while remembering

that student group disaffiliation should only
occur after full consideration of the group in
the context of how the University has treated
similar issues in the past.
The University's enforcement of its policies
cannot be construed as an "attack on religion"
as several news articles have asserted. It's true
that the organization won't have access to
some student-group funding and can't reserve
space for meetings until it registers a consti-
tution that complies with University policies.
But this is well within the University's normal
procedures, as it requires student organiza-
tions to re-register every year. Accordingto the
University's press release, leaders of AIVCF
and University officials are meeting this week
regarding the group's re-registration process,
indicating the University's commitment to reli-
gious diversity and free speech.
Thenearly70 studentreligiousorganizations
at the University- like Christians on Campus
and the Muslim Student Association reflect the
vibrancy of Michigan's religious community.
The Asian InterVarsity Christian Fellowship
can easily remain among them through submit-
ting a constitution that complies with the Uni-
versity's nondiscrimination policy.

LUCHEN (LOU) WANG
Dissecting C-sections

The Caesarean section is by far the grand-
est way for a person to enter the world. If it
weren't for C-sections, many babies wouldn't
have been born. Shakespeare's "Macbeth"
would have been a very different kind of trag-
edy if Macduff hadn't been ripped from his
mother's womb. In fact, some of us can attri-
bute our existence to this procedure. Our mod-
ern acceptance of the C-section is remarkable
because of historical aversion to it.
In the past, only brave souls performed
C-sections in order to save an infant from a
dying mother. C-sections posed a dangerously
high risk of infections and hemorrhage. In the
1970s, C-sections accounted for only about five
percent of deliveries in the United States, even
after the invention of antibiotics, anesthesia
and suturing that prevent hemorrhage. Obste-
tricians instead delivered with forceps. Only
ten years later, the landscape for deliveries
began to change dramatically.
According to the National Institutes - of
Health, by 1988 nearly one in every four babies
was delivered by C-section. By 2010, obstetri-
cians delivered 32.8 percent of babies by C-sec-
tion, and virtually none by forceps. Many critics
suspect these numbers are exaggerated.
Like all surgeries, C-sections come with
complications. They increase the chance of
infection, hemorrhage, re-hospitalization and
the likelihood that the uterus will rupture in
subsequent pregnancies.
Even the expenses are higher. According
to the CDC, hospital charges for a Caesarean
delivery are almost double those for a vaginal
delivery. Critics attribute this trend to physi-
cians' growing fear of malpractice lawsuits.
We can also contend that we've reached a
point in medicine where, for many mothers,
the risks of surgical delivery are equal to, or
less than, those of vaginal delivery. According
to the authors of "Elective Primary Caesar-
ean Delivery," a study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine, "accumulating
data have suggested increasing potential ben-
efits and decreased risks associated with its
(C-section's) performance."
The likelihood of a Caesarean is also
increased due to maternal age, bigger babies
and obesity. In addition, 90 percent of wome'n
who have C-sections end up repeating the pro-
cedure for subsequent births because of high

risks associated withvaginal birth at that point.
This trend is on the rise in the developed and
industrialized world.
There's a key message in our shift towards
Caesareans best illustrated by the decline
of the forceps. At one point, obstetricians
employed forceps in 40 percent of deliveries in
the United States. Forceps were actually asso-
ciated with equal or better outcomes for the
baby and mother compared to C-sections -
but only in the hands of talented obstetricians.
Learning how to use forceps required a kind
of intuition that didn'talways come naturally to
trainees. As-thrilling as it might be to perform a
skill accessible only to a select group, leaders in
obstetrics needed to improve the skills of every
obstetrician in the country, and thus improve
the health of every baby and mother. obstetri-
cians, as well as patients, need reliability and
consistency. The C-section has become the
answer to this dilemma.
Once uncommon, the Caesarean section has
- in just 10 to 20 years - become a staple in
obstetrics. In the near future, C-sections may
be even safer for both the mother and child.
Would more mothers prefer C-sections without
trying vaginal delivery?
The authors of the New England Journal of
Medicine article seem to suggest that this will
become increasingly acceptable. "Although the
evidence doesn't support the routine recom-
mendation of elective Caesarean delivery, we
believe that it does support a physician's deci-
sion to accede to an informed -patient's request
for such a delivery. "Will our society ultimately
choose to forgo our natural ability to give birth
for what may in the future be an equally safe or
safer process? And what will be the effects of
that decision?
In "Macbeth", Macduff - a man untimely
ripped from his mother's womb by a C-sec-
tion - kills Macbeth at the end of the play,
fulfilling the witches' prophecy that no one
born of woman could kill Macbeth. If Mac-
beth took place in a world where Caesareans
were common, Macduff would have still ful-
filled the prophecy and slain Macbeth, but
the prophecy would be a lot more mundane.
And for good or for bad, there would be a little
less drama.
Luchen (Lou) Wang is an LSA senior.

As a student in the School
of Education, part of my
class requirement involves
practicum at
middle and high
schools. Conse-
quently, I've been
thrown back to
the days of using
numbers to spell
out words on
Texas Instru- KATIE
ments calcula- STEEN
tors, lunch lines
and, of course,
dress codes.
Dress codes are a bit different for
me as a teacher than they were as a
student. I'm expected to look "pro-
fessional" to stress the fact that I'm
a mature, responsible, soon-to-be
teacher and to differentiate myself
from the students, some of whom are
only a few years younger than I.
A couple days before practicum
began, I panicked - realizing I had
zero articles of professional cloth-
ing - and took a trip to Briarwood.
I spent over $200 on pencil skirts,
button-up shirts and a pair of heels,
only to drive back to the store later
and return some of it ina self-loath-
ing, shopping-spree hangover.
I did keep most of my new ward-
robe, and as I walk into the school
each day donning my uniform next
to a fellow male student teacher, I
notice several things. I really, really
like being tall(ish). My steps are a
lot shorter than his due to constric-
tions of my heel-skirt combo. I walk
up stairs substantially slower than
he can. I get more compliments
from housemates on the days I'm
dressed "like a .teacher" than the
days I'm not. And pencil skirts real-
ly "accentuate the female shape,'"
i.e. my ass.
This flattery is particularly con-
fusing since now I'm back in the

same environment of dress codes
that tries to cover up the female
body as much as possible to reduce
"distraction" in the school environ-
ment. I'm dressing like a "young
female professional," which so far
has translated into "sexy but cov-
ered up and not too sensible."
This isn't the first time I real-
ized that how women dress, or are
expected to dress, often doesn't
make any sense. Like many other
people, I've grown up in the gray
area of dress codes, abiding some-
what by the rules that either aren't a
big deal if they're broken or serious
crimes, depending on who catches
you. Shorts and skirts had to be
below your fingertips, but more
importantly, if guys tried to look up
your skirt when you walked up the
stairs, your skirt was too short. It
was your fault, not theirs.
Shirts couldn't be too tight, and
necklines couldn't be too low. It
was a rule that really varied based
on cup size. There was also the
spaghetti-strap rule. That is, spa-
ghetti straps weren't allowed, but
lasagna-straps were fine. Of course,
the point was not to let your bra
straps show because bra straps are
a massive, obscene secret that no
one knows about.
The school dress codes were
never about looking nice or neat or
representative of the school cul-
ture. They were about covering up
our bodies and making us feel like
shit if we disobeyed them. Come
May and June, you'd begin to notice
the reappearance of girls who had
to change into their gym shorts in
the middle of the day after being
hunted down, chased throughout.
the school by hall monitors wield-
ing flaming sticks, while screaming,
"witch." Or worse, "slut.'
Guys,however, simply had to cover
up their crack and not wear shirts

advertising alcohol. Easy enough.
Anyway, as I continue with life
in the real world and continue to
clothe myself in the contradictory
bizarreness of feminine profession-
al apparel, I've become more aware
of how sensible, if not streamlined,
men's clothes are and how strange-
ly sexy women are expected to be.
It's as though everything you were
taught about how to dress grow-
ing up has been slowly, confusingly
reversed. Why is it that women are
expected to wear the outfit that
slows us, makes us walk a little
more carefully, requires crossed
legs and often costs substantially
more than men's attire?

0

Of course, bra
straps, are an
obscene 'secret.
I'm not saying that women who
wear heels and cute skirts are anti-
feminist dummies. That would
only. be promoting the same kind
of mindset that says "bra straps are
sinful," "women cannot make their
own decisions as to how they should
dress" and " she asked for it." It's
pretty confusing and strange, and
it's something that could potentially
affect hiring decisions, respect from
students and, in many instances, sal-
ary. It's something to be aware of.
It's a tricky line to walk between
professional and risque, sensible and
cute - especially when you're wear-
ing heels.

is because the University will not
accept it.
"It's the same as approved in
prior years, not an administrative
failure on our end, but (the Uni-
versity) won't accept it," Jao said.
Jao added that if the chapter
is not re-instated, other student
organizations could also be at
risk.
"Any group that's honest
about their requirements will
be impacted if (the University)
applies it fairly," Jao said. "It will
affect Orthodox Jewish groups
on campus, (the) MuslimAssocia-
tion."
Jao said the group does not dis-
criminate, but believes it makes
sense for the leadership council
of the chapter to adhere to tradi-
tional Christian values.
"Every student, regardless of
beliefs, is welcome to attend meet-
ings," he said. "But we believe it
makes sense for a religious group
to select religious leaders."
Sara Chang, a local recruiter
for InterVarsity, said the chapter
has worked with the University
since 2010 to be in compliance
with the University's standards.
"Our plans are that we would
be able to work with the Uni-
versity and have open, honest
discussion about nature of non-
discrimination policy, asking
them that they would revise it to
be as it stands but also give room
for religious groups to choose
religious leaders," Chang said.
According to the InterVaristy
website, . other chapters have
faced similar obstacles. The group
was derecognized after the 2010
U.S. Supreme Court decision,
Christian Legal Society v. Marti-
nez, which allows public institu-
tions to require that on-campus
groups accept all students regard-
less of their "status" or "beliefs."*
"InterVarsity will continue
its ministry at the University of
Michigan Ann Arbor campus
regardless of whether our chap-
ters are officially recognized, but
our desire is to maintain a posi-
tive relationship with the univer-
sity," a statement on the group's
website reads. "We are currently
working with university officials
a to resolve this situation."

HACKATHON

the Hackathon as a whole.
MHacks eclipsed PennApps,
a semi-annual hackathon held at
the University of Pennsylvania, to
become the most well-attended
college hackathon in the nation.
In January, PennApps had over

The initial count for Mhacks:
unclear. But Fontenot's original
count was 521 people. About 20
to 30 people came after that, and
a facilities manager at Palmer
Commons counted about 600
people. In fact, there were so
many attendees that 20 to 30
were temporarily moved to the
UGLi, Fontenot noted.
Still, he said that it was more

of hackers that attended that
made the event a success. The

with ink or chemicals, his lab
uses precisely inscribed grooves
to yield an observable color.
"Rather than using these chem-
icals, you could basically emboss
the structure - a very'green' print
technology,"Guo said.
Not only would printed prod-
ucts be more environmentally
friendly, they would also not be as
prone to fading that occurs with
current coloring techniques.
"(Current print companies are)
using huge amounts of chemi-
cals," he said. "A press company
is not exactly the greenest place
... In the future, this can all be
done using structural color and it
would be long lasting."
Unlike traditional color, which
is produced when molecules
absorb light, this new process,
called "structural color," is the
result of nanocavities trapping
light at specific wavelengths that
depend on the cavities' depths.
Most importantly, the cavities
themselves have no chemically
imposed color. Their structure
alone allows them to display
color to an observer.
"By making a structure rather
than using these molecules, it's
purely a physical effect," said Guo.
This same phenomenon can
be seen in nature, such as the
colors in the feathers of peacocks
and the wings of some species of
butterflies, Guo said.
By varying the depth of the
cavity, the researchers can create
many different colors. Because
each depthcorrespondsto adiffer-
ent observable color, Guo referred
to this as a selective property."
The cavities are manufactured
through an extremely precise
nano-imprinttechnique in the lab.
"Wecannotevenseethese(nano-
cavities) with an ordinary micro-
scope because (the size) is beyond
the diffractionlimit,"Guosaid.
Guo's lab has been work-
ing on similar technology for
several years. However, previ-
ous attempts have been "angle
dependent," meaning that the
observable color would change
based on the viewing angle. This
new development has almost
completely alleviated this prob-
lem, allowing the image to be

viewed at any angle without
changing color.
In addition to green printing,
this technology has potential
applications in anti-counterfeit-
ingefforts becauseofthe property
that makes it difficult to replicate.

tion, you can only see this kind of

is perpendicular to the grating
... That kind of property is much
more difficult to reproduce."
The lab looks forward to
applications in the development
of a colored e-book, similar to

extremely low power usage.
"If you make these sub-pixels
colored - and control them on

Taliban peace talks
flounder as troops exit

Paraguayan candidate
dies in helicopter crash

Mistrust, confusion
stalls peace process
in Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
The Afghan peace effort is floun-
dering, fraught with mistrust and
confusion amongkeyplayerseven
thoughthe hard-line Talibanmil-.
itants showsigns of softening and
their reclusive, one-eyed leader
made a surprise offer to share
power in a post-war Afghanistan.
The U.S. and its allies hope
the peace process, which began
nearly two years ago, will gain
traction before most interna-
tional forces withdraw from the
country in fewer than 23 months.
But although the Taliban appear
more ready to talk than ever
before, peace talks remain elusive
because of infighting among a ris-
ing number of interlocutors - all
trying to get some kind of nego-
tiations started.
Members of the Taliban are
in contact with representatives
from 30 to 40 different countries,
according to senior U.S., Afghan
and other officials The Associat-
ed Press interviewed in Afghani-
stan and Pakistan. Moreover, the
relationship among the key play-
ers - the U.S., Afghanistan and
Pakistan- is marked by distrust
that keeps tugging momentum
away from the peace process.
Many of the officials spoke on
condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to
speak publicly about the sensi-
tive contacts with the Taliban.
Finding a path to the negoti-
ating table will be a topic when
Afghan President Hamid Kar-
zai and Pakistan President Asif
Zardari hold a series of meetings
beginning Monday with British
Prime Minister David Cameron.
The meetings in London come
amid fresh tensions between
Kabul and its western allies.
Karzai recently warned the
West not to use peace talks as a
lever against his government. As
well, both Kabul and Washing-
ton are frustrated that Pakistan
is not monitoring the where-
abouts and activities of Taliban
prisoners it released in recent
months. Miffed by the criticism,

Pakistan says it freed the prison-
ers at the request of the Afghan
government and doesn't have the
resources to keep tabs on them.
No one in either Pakistan
or Afghanistan seems to know
where the dozens of released
prisoners have gone. Last week,
the Taliban issued a statement
by freed former Taliban Justice
Minister Mullah Nooruddin
Turabi on behalf of all the prison-
ers - an indication that at least
some might have rejoined the
ranks of the insurgency.
"There were no preconditions
to their release and we aregetting
criticism from our own peoplp
inside Afghanistan about that and
it is valid criticism," said Ismail
Qasemyar, a senior member of the
Afghan High Peace Council.
The peace council, which Kar-
zai set up to carry out peace nego-
tiations, handed Pakistan the list
of prisoners, including Turabi,
that it wanted freed. They have
also asked for the release of the
Taliban's former second in com-
mand, Mullah Abdul Ghani Bara-
dar, but Washington has urged
Pakistan not to release him, U.S.
and Afghan officials said.
For its part, the United States
has tried to accelerate the peace
process by working with Britain,
Norway and Germany to reach
out to the Taliban, said a senior
Western diplomat familiar with
the negotiations. Both France and
Tokyo have hosted meetings that
have been attended by Afghan
officials, opposition leaders and
the Taliban, although the Taliban
insist their participation should
not be misinterpreted as negotia-
tions.
One senior U.S. official said the
process is so nascent and egos so
fragile that it's like negotiating a
minefield. A European diplomat
told the AP that there areso many
backdoor talks going on that it's
hard to keep track of who is talk-
ing to whom.
This week, Karzai said he
wanted an end to all these talks.
Speaking at a water management
conference in the Afghan capi-
tal, Karzai expressed suspicion
that the peace process was being
hijacked by the West to strength-
en his opponents and undermine
his government.

Karzai's spokesman, Aimal
Faizi, told The AP inan interview
on the sprawling palace grounds
in Kabul that the president was
frustrated by what he perceives
are attempts by his political oppo-
nents and the West, including the
United States, to use the peace
process-to lay the groundwork for
a post-2014 Afghanistan led by
those hand-picked bythem.
This latest flap between Kar-
zai and the West could halt or at
least delay the official opening
of a Taliban office in the Middle
Eastern state of Qatar. The office
is intended to give the Taliban
an address from which they can
conduct peace talks. Faizi said
Karzai supports the office "in
principle," with some conditions.
"This office should be used
only as an address for talks
between the Afghan government
and the Taliban," Faizi said.
"This office should not be used
for any other purpose."
Faizi also said the president
wants the Taliban to publicly
announce that they will negoti-
ate peace only with the Afghan
High Peace Council. So far, the
Taliban have resisted, although
officials close to the president
say privately that they appear
to be softening their hard-line
stance.
Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah
Mujahid, seemed uncompromis-
ing when he spoke to The AP.
"There is no change in the
policy of the Islamic Emirate of
not talking to the Karzai gov-
ernment," he said "The Karzai
regime is powerless and installed
by others. Real parties to the
conflict are those who have com-
mitted aggression."
But still the Taliban have
shown signs of moderating their
positions in recent months.
According to several West-
ern officials, who are involved
or knowledgeable about the
process, the most telling sign of
flexibility came in a statement
issued late last year by Tali-
ban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar. In the statement marking
the Islamic holy holiday of Eid
al-Adha, Omar for the first time
offered to share power. He also
said he had no interest in start-
ing a civil war.

Presidential
hopeful's political
career ended
ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP)
- Paraguayan presidential can-
didate Lino Cesar Oviedo has
been killed in ahelicopter crash,
authorities said Sunday, ending
a dramatic political career that
included coups and repeated
attempts to lead this impover-
ished 6.5 million-person coun-
try.
Oviedo was returning with
his bodyguard from a politi-
cal rally in northern Paraguay
Saturday night when his pilot
encountered bad weather. All
three were killed in the crash,
said Johnny Villalba, a spokes-
man for Paraguay's airport
authority.
Defense Minister Maria Liz
Garcia said she traveled to the
scene Sunday with Oviedo's
daughter, congresswoman Fabi-
ola Oviedo, and confirmed that
the helicopter "disintegrated."
"One resident who lives
near the accident scene said
they heard a single explosion
Saturday night," she added.
"The aircraft ended up disinte-
grated and out of respect to the
families of the victims, I won't
release details about the cadav-
ers."
The air traffic control tower
in the provincial city of Con-
cepcion received the pilot's last
communication, Garcia said - a
brief message that they were
changing course due to a storm
at 9 p.m. local time.
Lino Oviedo, 69, was running
in April's elections as leader of
Paraguay's third-largest oppo-
sition party, the National Union
of Ethical Citizens.
A retired general and former
army chief, Oviedo had tried
for years to take the helm of his
nation, and not always through
democratic means.
As a colonel in 1989, Oviedo
had been tasked with taking
prisoner none other than Alfre-
do Stroessner, the feared dic-
tator who had ruled Paraguay
since 1954.
That bloody military coup

sent Stroessner into Brazilian
exile, but did little to dimin-
ish the hold on Paraguayan
politics that his Colorado Party
had cemented. Oviedo's role in
the ouster was rewarded with
a meteoric rise through the
ranks of the army.
A diminutive cavalry offi-
cer, only 5-foot-3 inches (1.62
meters) tall, Oviedo was pro-
moted to brigadier general
three months after capturing
Stroessner. By 1992, he had
become a division general,
and then President Juan Car-
los Wasmosy named him army
chief.
Membership in the Colorado
Party had been a requirement
for any officer during the dicta-
torship, but Oviedo's constant
involvement in party politics
generated frictions with the
president.
In April 1996, a short-lived
coup in which Oviedo partici-
pated and other maneuverings
led to his firing and forced
retirement. He ran as a can-
didate to succeed Wasmosy,
winning the Colorado Party
primary ahead of the May 1998
presidential elections, but was
then convicted in a military
court for his role in the coup,
ending his candidacy.
His would-be vice presi-
dent, Raul Cubas, instead won
the election and immediately
ordered the release of Oviedo,
despite the judiciary's rulings.
Oviedo had an irrepressible
desire to govern, and quickly
became known as the power
behind Cubas, angering other
political leaders.
Cubas' vice president, Luis
Maria Argana, was assassinat-
ed in 1999, and the slain man's
relatives and followers accused
Oviedo of being the master-
mind. Cubas resigned in the
resulting turmoil and Oviedo
fled the country and renounced
his Colorado Party membership,
founding the UNACE party.
Facing Paraguayan arrest
orders in the Wasmosy case,
Oviedo remained a political ref-
ugee in Brazil until 2004, when
he returned and was convicted.
The Supreme Court later
exonerated Oviedo after mili-

tary officers denied there had
been a coup attempt, freeing
him to run for president in 2008.
He came in third, splitting the
vote that gave former Catholic
bishop Fernando Lugo the pres-
idency and ended 60 years of
one-party rule by the Colorado
Party.
Oviedo was born in the small
village of Juan de Mena, out-
side Asuncion, on Sept. 23, 1943.
He graduated from the nation's
military academy, and married
Raquel Marin, an Argentine,
with whom he had three chil-
dren. Oviedo also had other
children with two Paraguayan
women before his marriage.
Oviedo's family now main-
tains his legacy in his UNACE
party: His children Fabiola and
Ariel are deputies in Congress,
and his nephew, Lino Cesar
Oviedo Sanchez, is a senator.
Oviedo "had, an enormous
capacity for work. At 5 a.m.
he was in his office, receiving
people until midnight, usually
the poor, who came to him from
their villages seeking help," for-
mer Sen. Enrique Gonzalez, a
longtime political ally, told The
Associated Press.
"He was an individual with
great charisma, he spoke (Par-
aguay's indigenous language
of) Guarani perfectly, and he
wove jokes in Guarani into his
speeches. He had the spiritual
strength to put up with being
persecuted. His military prepa-
ration enabled him to put up
with extreme situations. In
December, he even managed to
come out of a Brazilian hospi-
tal with two stents after a heart
operation with more enthusi-
asm than ever."
U.S. Undersecretary of State
Peter Romero had declared after
the Wasmosy affair that Oviedo
"lacks democratic credentials."
Gonzalez took issue with that
label, noting that Oviedo also
"founded a political party and
participated in elections, build-
ing it into Paraguay's third-larg-
est political force." The blaze
was the deadliest in Brazil since
at least 1961; when a fire that
swept through a circus. killed
503 people in Niteroi, Rio de
Janeiro.

Festival film'The East'
tack les political conflict

Keeping pace
with technology

Sundance selection
examines
eco-terrorism
By CARLY KEYES
Daily Arts Writer
Over athousand people funnel
into the entrance. Press passes
hang from the necks of reporters
as cameras weigh down photog-
raphers' shoulders. Even in the
dead of winter, the popcorn line
flies out the door.
It was not a typical night at
the movies.
On Thursday, Jan. 31, the
Michigan Theatre presented a
special screening of the official
Sundance Film Festival selec-
tion, "The East."
After a dragging presentation
celebrating the work of Russell
B. Collins, the theater's execu-
tive director and CEO, the main
event began and all was forgiven
- it was worth the wait.
The film follows a group of
eco-terrorists that refers to itself
as "The East," led by Benji (Alex-
ander Skarsgard, "What Maisie
Knew") and Izzy (Ellen Page,
"Touchy Feely"), who target cor-
rupt, big-name pharmaceutical
powerhouses.
Whether a company pollutes
people with its dangerous drugs,
or the environment with toxic
waste from its industrial plants,
it better watch out for a "jam": a
carefully planned attack by The
East that gives the corporate top
dogs a taste of their own medi-
cine - sometimes literally.
Brit Marling ("The Company
You Keep") is Sarah, an under-
cover agent who joins the con-
niving clan to uncover its group
members' true identities and to
thwart their attempts to bring
down businesses.

She leads a relatively unknown
cast despite a few big-name stars,
but, here, the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts; the
actors who compose "The East"
ooze chemistry and function like
a family - one cohesive unit of
passionate activists. Despite the
"terrorist" label, their personali-
ties and "do-gooder" intentions
garner viewers' sympathies as
these eccentric environmental
advocates encounter serious risk
while seeking vengeance.
Marling and director Zal Bat-
mangli ("Sound of My Voice")
offer a bold and courageous
screenplay of clever quips. The
Michigan Theatre audience
came alive as the dialogue took
shots at the corporate world
- remarks that scorched and
mocked with force. But the larg-
est shock of the night came off-
screen when the two filmmakers
revealed that the imaginative
and captivating story had been
derived from a real-life experi-
ence.
They held a Q&A session after
the screening, led by Sundance
Film Festival Program direc-
tor Trevor Groth, during which
they mentioned that-"The East"
was inspired bya summer spent
traveling across the country
together, trying to spend as little
money as possible. They called it
a "buy nothing" summer.
"We learned to train hop and
dumpster dive, we slept on roof-
tops and we met a lot of anar-
chist collectives and alternative
communities," Marling said.
Batmangli described the pro-
cess of picking through garbage
to find his next meal.
"At first, the thought of eating
food from a dumpster nauseated
me. I wanted to observe people
doing it but I, myself, didn't want
to do it," he said.

Can vampires even have heart-to-hearts?

FOX SEARCHLUGHT

Then, after making a joke
about the "nicer" Whole Foods
and Trader Joe's dumpsters,
Batmangli got serious about the
issue.
"We feel so certain that when
we're in our normal lives ... eat-
ing out of a dumpster is wrong,"
he said. "Then when you realize
how much waste there is in the
world, you ask, 'What do we do
about that? What is our respon-
sibility for that?' As filmmakers
we wanted to ask those ques-
tions and start a dialogue."
"The East" is a wake-up call.
The film splatters "green" paint
all over the audience hoping that
it won't wash off. Viewers may
now think twice before they
throw away a half-eaten apple

or, on a larger and more destruc-
tive scale, release a harmful drug
to the market or dump chemicals
into a lake.
Marling and Zal have created
an authentic film that showcases
one of the most pressing con-
temporary global issues: the bat-
tle to protect and preserve the
environment. It educates and
inspires while it entertains; it's
art - great art - with a political
purpose.
As the audience exited the
Michigan Theatre that night in
Ann Arbor, a city famous for its
balance of quality amusement
and academics (not to mention
its sustainability efforts), it's
safe to say they got their money's
worth.

F IL M N OT EBOOK
Sundance shorts offer
emotional, lasting impressions

By NATALIE GADBOIS
Daily Arts Writer
Short films can confuse as
often as they transcend. They
have the difficult task of taking
snapshots of the human expe-
rience and turning them into
artistic pieces, while still making
something that is enjoyable and
relatable. In the best of Sundance
Shorts, 10 short films explored
aspects of family life, love and
sacrifice - all within very differ-
ent settings and contexts.
In a world increasingly at
odds with itself, three films,
"Robots of Brixton," "Fishing
Without Nets" and "Kthimi"
("The Eeturn"), addressed
themes of violence and survival
to gutting effects. In "Robots,"
animated robots wander the
streets of a decrepit, heavily
industrialized city. They join a
revolt in the streets - as the
robot police force attacks them,
the film flashes to real-time
images of other violent protests.
in Syria and England. Though
the visuals, at times, overpower
the message, the film illustrates
the senselessness of violence in a
world where we don't necessar-
ily control our own actions.
"Kthimi," set in war-torn
Kosovo, looks at violence in a
different way, delicately and poi-
gnantly following a husband and
wife the night of his return from
a four-year sentence in a Serbian
prison. They have a tender and

relatable relationship, which
makes the jarring brutalities all
the more heartbreaking. In 21
short minutes, director Blerta
Zeqiri deftly portrays a family
changed, but not ruined, from
pain and cruelty. It's possibly
the shortest film to ever make
an audience both laugh and cry
with shared anguish.
In a one-two punch, the
Somalian short "Fishing With-
out Nets" followed "Kthimi"
with its own tale of sacrifice
and dignity on the pirate-con-
trolled coast of Somalia. Abdi,
a young father, barely makes a
living fishing with nets, and the
film follows his identity crisis
as he decides between joining
the frighteningly inexperienced
and violent pirates, or living
without money or medicine for
his baby daughter. Filmed in an
actual Somalian village with a
shaky, handheld camera, "Fish-
ing," though simple, human-
izes a business seen only before
through the lens of CNN. R
While both "Kthimi" and
"Fishing" received a prolonged
ovation from the audience, other
shorts didn't pan out so well.
"Svamp" ("Fungus"), chronicles
a Swedish woman as she sits in
her dumpy apartment, listening
to public radio and complaining
about the venereal disease she
suspects her ex-boyfriend gave
her - it's bizarre and lifeless.

FILM REVIEW
Elegant'Rust and Bone'
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer

Simply put, "Rust and Bone" is
a touching, poetic story of people
who've been dealt a bad hand in
life. There's
no build-up B+
to a climax,
no twists and Rustand
turns and no Bone
jaw-dropping
end -this could At State
be the story Theater
of any- of our
lives, but what Sony
makes this film
so endearing is
that we'd all like our stories to be
told in such a tasteful way.
Stephanie (Marion Cottilard,
"Inception"), a marine-life train-
er, gets into an accident when a
whale knocks down a stage dur-
ing a show, causing her to lose
both legs to the very job she loves.
Meanwhile, Alain (Matthias
Schoenaerts,"Bullhead"), a man
between jobs, moves to his sis-
ter's home with his five-year-old
son to start a new life in southern
France. Stephanie and Alain, hav-
ing met at a bar before her acci-
dent, become unlikely friends as
Alain helps Stephanie out of her
inhibitions and encourages her to
turn a new leaf. But his own life is
far from perfect - built-up anger
causes Alain to partake in street
fighting for money and fun, tear-
ing him apart from his son.
Stephanie and Alain are two
adults growingup into their new
lives. They're figuring out who
they are together, finding out
what they want to do and dis-
covering their passions all over
again. They screw up aplenty,
but they help each other back on
their feet - literally and meta-
phorically. Built around a purely
human foundation of insecuri-
ties, friendship, sexual attraction,
confusion and depression, "Rust
and Bone" is hard to watch with-
out shedding a tear or two.

A fitting farewell
for Liz Lemon
and the gang
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
ManagingArtsEditor
"30 Rock" could have eas-
ily ended things with "A Goon's
Deed in a Weary World." Equal
parts hilari-
ous and sen- A+
timental, the
Jan. 24 episode 30Rock
ushered in Liz
Lemon's (Tina Series Finale
Fey) new TGS- Review
free life with NBC
the arrival of
her adopted
children, who turn out to be tiny
versions of Tracy Jordan (Tracy
Morgan) and Jenna Maroney
(Jane Krakowski), the real kids
Liz has been raising for the past
seven years. Kenneth the Page
becomes Kenneth the President
of NBC, a fitting fate for the
character, especially since it was
once prophesied: In the show's
very first season, Jack remarks
that, in the end, he'll either be
the one working for Kenneth or
dead by his hand. Everything
about "A Goon's Deed" screams
finality in the best way possible.
But this is Liz Lemon, damnit
- even great isn't good enough.
So, we get an additional two-
part finale that somehow out-,
performs its prelude.
One of the Dalai Lama's rules
for living is that you have to
learn the rules to know how to
break them. No other show lives
by this principle quite as superb-
ly as "30 Rock," which bends the
rules all the time. But it'sbecause
the cast and crew have mastered
all the rules of comedy that they
can break them to huge success.
With larger-than-life characters
and truly wacko plotlines, Fey
made the madcap mainstream,
changing the entire equation for
what makes great television.
"30 Rock" rejects the notion
that every sitcom needs a will-
they-won't-they couple, instead
building a workplace relation-

ship between Jack and Liz that,
through the years, became the
emotional centerpiece of the
series. In "Hogcock!," the first
half-hour of the finale, both
parties confront personal cri-
ses: Jack doubts he'll ever find
complete fulfillment, and Liz's
ongoing battle to balance her
personal and professional lives
reaches a tipping point as she
realizes she will never be the
Happy Stay At Home Mom.
But at the heart of the episode
rests their relationship, which is
pushed to the edge as Liz real-
izes Jack's constant tough love
means she's never satisfied,
while Jack feels its Liz's fault
that he can't find happiness in
the new CEO job. "You're just an
alcoholic with a great voice," Liz
throws at him.
The finale's Tracey Wigfield-
and-Fey-penned second half,
"Last Lunch," features a promi-
nent Lutz storyline - a choice
that's both bizarre and brilliant,
ending with what's probably the
first time Lutz has ever gotten
what he wants.
Because of a clause in Tra-
cy's contract, the team has to
reassemble to produce one last
episode of "The Girlie Show."
Wanting Jenna to express real
emotion for the first time in
front of a cam-ah-rah, Kenneth
asks her to find something that
she truly loves about TGS, some-
thing that will make her miss it
all. In the end, it's the removal
of her mirror that makes Jenna
human. "Hogcock!" and "Last.
Lunch" are full of emotionally
resonant triggers that stir fans'
hearts like the mirror does for
our mega-melodramatic, per-
petually' daydrunk top-shelf
dildo Jenna Maroney (Side note:
Where is Krakowski's Emmy?).
Whether it's finding out that
not only has Jenna never been
the victim of Mickey Rourke's
catapult, but she's never even
met the man, or watching Liz
explain to Tracy, in the strip
club where they had their very
first meeting, that they prob-
ably won't be friends when it's
all over but she'll still love him,
or hearing Jack come as close as

he'll ever come to telling Liz he
loves her (right before "figuring
it all out," which translates to his
next big idea: clear dishwashers
"so you can see what's going on
inside!"), you'll want to drink all
the throwing wine by the end.
"It okay, don'tbe cry."
Amid all the catharsis, the
finale doesn't lose the jokes,
from the rapidfire cold open to
the final moment, scored by a
reprise of Jenna's incompre-
hensible "Rural Juror" (one last
shining example of an oddball
gag only this show could ever
pull off). A one-year flashfor-
ward fabulously reveals what
observant fans have put togeth-
er through the years: Kenneth is
immortal.
But there's also a very somber
sentiment seeping through its
farewell, and not just because
Jack is pretending to plan a sui-
cide and Pete unsuccessfully
fakes his own death. "30 Rock"
has always been a champion of
meta humor, and its persistent
mockery of its own home net-
work gives way to some of its
most potent jokes (who could
ever forget "MILF Island"? Kho-
nani? "Bitch Hunter"?). And even
at its end, it continues to twist
the knife into the peacock's side.
The finale offers a truly dismal
outlook on the current state of
the TV industry, with Kenneth
handing Liz a list of TV No-No
Words, including "edgy," "com-
plex," "shows about shows,"
"woman," "high concept" and
"Justin. Bartha." The flashfor-
ward reveals Liz working on a
piece-of-shit show that conforms
in all the ways "30 Rock" didn't.
Sure, she seems to have finally
found a way to balance fam-
ily' and work, but there's some-
thing depressing about seeing
Liz sacrifice her personal voice
to follow the rules of paint-by-
the-numbers TV. Let's hope that
it's not a forecast for Fey and the
superhero cast and crew that
made "30 Rock" the most quot-'
able, notable sitcom of the past
decade.
Thank you, "30 Rock," for
giving us the best days of our
"flerm." Lemon, out!

In raucus environment,
No. 1 Michigan can't
hang with Indiana
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
BLOOMINGTON-Tabbed as the
"Game of the Season" prior to tip-off,
Saturday's prizefight between the No. 1
Michigan basketball team and No. 3 Indi-
ana lived up to every bit of its billing and
then some. The two frontrunners in the

Big Ten title race played with intensity
typically reserved for March, each team
playing like the best team in the country
for significant stretches.
But in the end, Indiana - playing at
home in perhaps the nation's loudest,
most intimidating
arena - proved to MICHIGAN 73
be too much for the INDIANA 81
Wolverines. With
Michigan trailing by seven and trying to
hang on for one final run, preseason-All
American Cody Zeller out-hustled four
Michigan players for a loose-ball offen-
sive rebound with just under two min-
utes left. The Hoosiers went on to make

their free throws to seal the game, as the
Wolverines fell, 81-73, despite clawing
back from two double-digit deficits.
The loss likely means that for the
fourth straight week, there will be a new
No.1 team.
"This is a young team, and these envi-
ronments have tremendous opportuni-
ties for them to grow, and that's our only
message right now," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "We can't be patting each
other on the back, and moral victories
and things like that - no, we're very dis-
appointed, but we can't dwell on it.
"That was two good teams playing.
Somebody was going to win that game

and we didn't. Our kids held their own."
Zeller and sophomore point guard
Trey Burke lived up to all of their pre-
season hype. The two preseason All-
Americans and Player of the Year
candidates at times single-lhandedly car-
ried their teams, combining for 44 points.
Burke finished with 25 points and eight
assists, while Zeller had 19 points and
nine rebounds - three of them on the
offensive end, which were all slammed
home for put-back dunks.
But for as well as Burke played, Michi-
gan couldn't recover from the conspicu-
ous absence of two of its freshmen: guard
Nik Stauskas and forward Glenn Robin-

son III. Stauskas, who Beilein said missed
Friday's practice with the flu, finished
with 10 points, though one of his two
3-pointers came in the final moments,
with the game already out of reach. The
freshman, known for his shooting ability,
connected on just one of his eight first-
half shots and failed to find any rhythm.
Despite playing the entirety of the
game, Robinson scored just two points on
1-of-6 shooting, while pulling down four
rebounds. But Beilein stopped short of
pinning Robinson's unproductive night
solely on the freshman.

BLOOMINGTON -
his game was marked on every-
body's calendar.
Two top-five teams playing
in the best conference in college bas-
ketball for what could be a preview of a
tournament game in March.
ESPN's College GameDay was in
town and students were lined up out-
side hours before the 9 p.m. tipoff just to
get four seconds of face time on camera.
There was Trey Burke and Cody
Zeller fighting on opposite ends of the
court for a signature win and for the
right to be called the National Player
of the Year. And then there was John
Beilein and Tom Crean, coaches who
have taken their respective programs
back to national prominence and hopes
of a conference title and more.
It was No.1 Michigan and No. 3 Indi-

ana. Two teams battling for first place
in the Big Ten, but more importantly, for
the title of the best team in the nation.
Seventeen thousand, four hundred

play for 40 minutes,
but how important
was this game,
besides a No.1 rank- COLLEEN
ing that may not THOMAS
even be held for -
more than a week?
Michigan will still be in the top five
come Monday, and there's at least one
more game between these two teams
- a March 10 matchup in Ann Arbor.
There's likely to be more, too - possibly

a Big Ten tournament title game and
maybe even a game in April with a shot
at the national championship.
For a game still early in the confer-
ence slate, it's tough to say this game
had huge implications for either team.
Michigan has three tough games com-
ing up - Ohio State, Wisconsin and
Michigan State - and Indiana has two
road games against Illinois and Ohio
State, and the Hoosiers still must face
Michigan and Michigan State on the
road.
Big Ten coaches and players have
been stressing the strength of the
conference all season, saying that the
conference champion will have multiple
losses by the end of the season. They're
definitely right - both the Wolverines
and Hoosiers have plenty of other

BLOOMINGTON - Just like in
Columbus, the freshmen disappeared.
Guard Nik Stauskas and forward
Glenn Robinson III were silenced for
almost the entirety of the primetime
matchup between No. 1 Michigan and
No. 3 Indiana. The duo that normally
averages 24 combined points per game
was held to just 12 points -10 of which
came in the last half of the second stan-
za.
The record-setting decibel levels
in Assembly Hall got to the freshmen

early, as did asimilarraucous crowd did
in Columbus.
"This is a young team and these envi-
ronments a'e tremendous opportuni-
ties for them to grow," said Michigan
coach John Beilein.
The noise seemed to get to Stauskas
early, as the guard missed three easy
layups and couldn't hit a 3-pointer until
the last 30 seconds of the game. Staus-
kas went 3-for-10 from the field and
1-for-5 from beyond the arc.
For Stauskas, alow 3-point shooting
percentage has been a trend in Big Ten
games. He's shooting just 36 percent
from beyond the arc during conference
play, compared-to his 48 percent on the
year, and is getting targeted by oppp-
nents' defenses to limit his impact.
Against Ohio State, Stauskas
attempted only three shots, all from

For the Daily
College basketball is madness.
Top five teams lose decidedly to
unranked teams almost weekly.
Ascendancy to the No. 1 throne is
quick and occupancy is brief.
But there is a method to the
madness. Everything that has
happened, is happening, and will
happen in college basketball can
be represented by numbers.
Understanding these numbers
and how to use them is key to
APBRmetrics (think sabermet-
rics for basketball)..
APBRmetrics attempt to model
and predict outcomes in bas-
ketball. But they're just that-a
model. APBR metrics are devoid
of any human intuition, relying
entirely on predetermined calcu-
lations.
So, naturally, when these
models and algorithms predict
games more accuratelythan their
human counterparts, people are
surprised.
Wanting to join in this rivalry
between man and machine, I
abandoned my born species and
began work on my own model to
rank teams almost two years ago.
After hundreds of hours of test-

ing, I am releasing my model to
the public.
My model is but one of many in
the annals of APBRmetrics, but I
believe it to be the most accurate
model. Overthe pastseason, ithas
consistently predicted more than
75 percent of games correctly, a
rarely seen verism in college bas-
ketball.
At its core, the model is sim-
ple-in fact, it only uses three fac-
tors: margin of victory, strength
of schedule, and home-court
advantage. These three factors
are thrown into the model and
mixed into algorithms, to pop out
whatI call the Dominance Rating.
The main thesis of my model
{ is that there isn't as much differ-
ence between a one-point win
and a one-point loss as human
voters tend to believe. Ithus treat
them similarly. The difference
between, say, a ten-point win and
a one-point win is much more sig-
nificant than between a one-point
Twin and a one-point loss.
My model assigns each game
played by a team a point value
as it were. All wins are assigned
positive values, all losses negative
values. The greater the margin
of victory, the greater the point
value. Strength of schedule (after

being put on an s-curve) and
home-court advantage are also
factors in the point value. A team's
final Dominance Rating is deter-
mined by the average of its points
assigned per game.
In my model, all 347 NCAA
Division-I men's basketball teams
are assigned a Dominance Rating.
I call the collective ranking of the
teams' Dominance Ratings the
Dominance Index.
It is my hope that the Domi-
nance Index will outperform
human metrics in terms of pre-
dictive power. Iseek validation to
my hypothesis that statistics can
represent all facets of basketball
(and sports as a larger whole).
The analysis of that hypoth-
esis will provide the foundation
of this blog. Through the course
of the season, I'll discuss what the
Dominance Index believes will
happen and-most of the time,
hopefully-why its prognosis was
correct. I also hope to touch on
various other elements of APBR-
metrics (such as efficiency and
adjusted field-goal percentage)
and give my take on their efficacy.
So sit back, relax and be pre-
pared to forget everything you've
been told about college basketball.
It's all wrong.

Beilein said when asked if he'd
like to see Robinson play more
aggressively. "That's something
that's a work in progress.
"It's just all part of it. We've
got to continue to try to ... recog-
nize what we're doing and (see)
how we can get Glenn more
involved."
But the game's biggest dispar-
ity came on the free throw line,
where Indiana displayed an
impressive propensity to get to
the charity stripe.
The Wolverines attempted
just seven free throws, while the
Hoosiers shot 22-of-25 from the
line.
After trailing by as many as
15 points, Michigan (7-2 Big
Ten, 20-2 overall) showed the
first-half resilience it lacked in
Columbus ina loss to Ohio State
in January.
The Wolverines shot just
2-of-11 from 3-point range in
the first half, while the Hoo-
siers shot 50 percent from deep.
Burke and Zeller pulled their
weight early and often, with
Burke scoring a game-leading
14 points in the opening stanza,
while Zeller notched 11 points
to go along with six boards.
Though the Hoosiers owned
the first half, Burke stunned
the raucous arena by draining a
step-back jumper with just four

seconds remaining, allowing the
Wolverines to go into the locker
room trailing just 36-32.
After Indiana (8-1, 20-2) led
by double-digits for much of
the opening 20 minutes, Michi-
gan scored 17 of the half's final
25 points, including an 8-0 run,
to chip away at Indiana's lead.
The Hoosiers were held to just
16 points in the final 15 minutes
of the half after coming out fir-
ing in the opening five minutes.
Indiana scored 20 points in the
game's opening five minutes,
making its first six shots, includ-
ing four threes.
"I think we did a good job at
responding to their punch, we
just didn't get over the hump,"
Burke said. "That's something
that we're continuing to try to
make adjustments on and get
better at - just coming out and
making the first punch."
Just minutes into the second
half, Michigan tied the game on
a 3-pointer from Stauskas, but
Indiana followed with an 11-0
run.
But just like in the first half,
the young Wolverines failed to
go away, responding with an.
11-2 run to bring the game back
to within two points with 11
minutes remaining.
Junior guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. chipped in with 18 points
and freshman forward Mitch
McGary played well, scoring 10
points and pulling down seven
rebounds.

But the rest of the Wolver-
ines' supporting cast - includ-
ing redshirt junior forward
Jordan, who was limited to just
two minutes after spraining his
ankle last weekend - failed to
produce enough offense to top-
ple the Hoosiers on the road.
With Kansas also losing Sat-
urday, Michigan could still find
itself ranked in Monday's top-
two spots.

deep, and missed them all. The
Buckeyes were obviously target-
ing the sharpshooter - and it
worked.Against Indianaon Satur-
day, Jordan Hulls was tasked with
defending Stauskas. Though the
freshman hit three free throws
to tie the game at 40 early in the
second half, the Hoosiers' defense
contained him until late in the
game, when his 10 points didn't
matter much.
Like Stauskas, Robinson was
hounded by the defense most of
the night - he was guarded by

Victor Oladipo for the majority of
the game -and despite playing all
40 minutes, he rarely found the
ball or an open look.
The forward had four rebounds
- just 1.7 below his season average
- but his presence on the boards
was hardly felt throughout the
game. Robinson was also held to
just two points, which came in
the form of a dunk with 1:09 left
to play in the game. By that point,
Michigan's fate was all but sealed.
"(The Hoosiers), they hugged
the rails (Saturday), and kind of
made us win the game just from
the point guard and the center
position," said sophomore guard
Trey Burke. "We have to con-

tinue to try to get (Stauskas and
Robinson) good looks within our
offense. Indiana did a good job
denying them, and it was tough to
get them the ball."
But for every missed basket by
Stauskas and Robinson on Satur-
day, there was a rebound or steal
from forward Mitch McGary.
With redshirt junior forward
Jordan Morgan limited again -
he played just two minutes, and
redshirt sophomore forward Jon
Horford started in his place for
the second consecutive game -
McGary was again able to step up.
The freshman played a season-
high 28 minutes and tied a career
best with 10 points. McGary's

offensive production isn't usually
his strong suit, but his scoring and
defensive presence were the big-
gest aspects of his performance on
Saturday.
Though Indiana's Cody Zeller
was able to put up 19 points,
McGary did a good job holding
Zeller to tougher shots and was
able to be more physical with the
Hoosier sophomore. He also got a
couple of steals off Zeller, but one
area McGary wasn't happy with
in his game was Zeller's second-
chance points.
"I think we did a good job
defensively," McGary said.
"(Zeller) didn't get too many easy
buckets, but offensive rebounding,

I made a few mistakes boxing him
out while I was trying to help or
block a shot, and he got some easy
buckets there."
McGary also pulled downseven
rebounds and was able to keep up
with Zeller on the glass, proving
that the freshman is continuing
to improve his all-around game,
much to the pleasure of his coach.
"(McGary) certainly did (take
another step forward)," Beilein
said. "He was making some big
inputs in there. He has to continue
to learn how to use his body at the
right angles to guard in the post,
but he has a real good sense for
stealing the ball. I just liked the
way Mitch was playing in there."

Junior forward Derek DeBlois - took a turnover from the blue

line and rifled the puck into the
upper-right corner. The shot was
hard enough to knock Hildeb-
rand's bottle of water off of the
top of the net and force it to spill
on the ice.
His goal was even more
impressive considering it came
when Michigan was shorthand-
ed, exemplifying its strong spe-
cial teams play as of late.
"It feels great," DeBlois said. "I
closed my eyes for that shot."
Michigan State began the sec-
ond period with a shorthanded
goal of its own. Chirs Forfar took
control of the puck near the cen-
terline and skated down the open
ice before fooling Rutledge.
But the Wolverines came out
stronger off of the goal, looking
determined to finally sing their
fight song.
Freshman forward Andrew
Copp.continued his strong rookie
campaign when he slipped the
puck between Hildebrand's legs
for the go-ahead goal. Copp's
fifth goal of the season came from
sophomore forward Andrew
Sinelli, who took the rebound
from behind the net and found
the Ann Arbor native in the
crease.
But the Spartans wouldn't go
down easily, when captain Greg
Wolfe laid out to get his stick on a
puck sliding in front of Rutledge.
For much of the game, Michi-
gan's defense prevented open
looks, something it had struggled
to do with No. 9 Western Michi-
gan last weekend.
DeBlois' night wasn't done,

though, as he found himself in the
right place to swing the momen-
tum back in Michigan's favor.
After a hard shot from senior
defenseman Lee Moffie couldn't
be handled by Hildebrand, DeB-
lois tapped in the rebound from
the left side.
The goal was the final dagger
to the Spartans' chances of mak-
ing a comeback.
"That was huge," Berenson
said of DeBlois' second goal. "We
were on our heels, we weren't
playing well, we had just given up
a goal and we were sloppy in our
zone.
"It was one of those goals
that really discourages the other
team."
Freshman forward Boo Nieves
contributed a goal late inthe peri-
od for good measure, attempting
a pass that deflected off the skate
of a Michigan State defenseman.
Rutledge was never tested in
the final minutes of the game,
allowing the Wolverines' fore-
check to dominate a dejected
Spartan squad.
"It's one thing to sweep, and
then I think it's another thing to
sweep State," DeBlois said. "It
couldn't have come at a better
time."
And when the time came to

A return to form for DeBlois

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - Midway through
the first period of the Michi-
gan hockey team's game against
Michigan State on Saturday after-
noon, junior forward Derek DeB-
lois poked the puck away from a
Spartan in the neutral zone.
Skating towards the goal on
a breakaway, DeBlois closed his
eyes, then sniped the puck over
Michigan State goaltender Jake
Hildebrand's left shoulder - a
shot so powerful that the water
bottle attached to the goal was
ejected out of its fastenings and
fell to the ice.

er-play tallies and one was short-.
handed. The duo of DeBlois and
freshman forward Boo Nieves -
who had combined for just seven
goals before this weekend - tal-
lied six against Michigan State.
For the Wolverines, whose
special teams have been a work
in progress since October, this
weekend signified some pretty
big strides.
"We took advantage of loose
pucks," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson on Friday. "There were
a couple of loose pucks or turn-
overs and all of a sudden, it was in
the net. It was just good, instinc-
tive hockey plays."
The Wolverines' power play,
though mildly effective, hasn't
been close to the production lev-
els that Berenson would like. This
weekend, though, the unit finally
started to play to its potential,
with DeBlois and Nieves at the
center of it all.
DeBlois' goal off a one-timer in
the second period of Friday's 3-2
win over the Spartans came at
even strength, though he scored it
just seconds after the Wolverines'
power play ended. Nieves found
twine with another one-timer,
but this time, Michigan was still
on the man advantage.
Hildebrand never even had a
chance to register that the shots
were coming. And according to
Berenson, the Wolverines need
more of these one-timers going
forward to keep blind sighting the
opposition.
"(The goal is) not something
that was planned, it just is,"
Berenson said. "We got pucks on
the net quick and surprised the
goalie. We got away quick, and
they went in."
But for all of the power play's
improvements, it was the penalty
kill that stole the show this week-
end. On Friday, the unit came
through in the clutch when, with

three minutes left in the game
and Michigan only up by one,
senior defenseman Lee Moffie
went to the box for interference.
The Wolverines have been
notorious for giving up goals late
in the third period, and this pen-
alty couldn't have come at a worse
time. On this occasion, though,
Michigan State didn't even regis-
ter a shot on goal.
DeBlois' shorthanded goal was
the cherry on top of the unit's
stellar performance that held
the Spartans to a weekend total
of just eight shots on the man
advantage. But his weekend acco-
lades didn't stop there - with 17

seconds remaining in Saturday's
contest, his second-period goal
gave Michigan an all-important
two-goal lead going into the final
frame.
"It was huge," DeBlois said of
the goal. "They kind of had a little
momentum there. Any goal at the
end of the period kind of deflates a
team, and it came at a good time."
DeBlois' play over the weekend
hardly came as a surprise to any-
one, least of all Berenson.
"I think he's just being Derek,"
Berenson said. "He had another
hard-nosed, hard-working week-
end and he got rewarded. ... He's
just in the right place at the time."


PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Junior forward Derek DeBlois
exploded for three goals this weekend.
A forceful shot and an impres-
sive play to be sure, but even more
so considering that the Wolver-
ines pulled it off shorthanded.
It was just that kind of series for
DeBlois and Michigan's special-
teams unit - everything seemed
to be clicking perfectly en routeto
the Wolverines' weekend sweep
of the Spartans.
Out of Michigan's eight goals
over the weekend, two were pow-
