ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

BEN ROSENFELD
Daily News Editor

Your name is Michael Sterling 
and you are 6 years old. You are 
sitting cross-legged on the rug 
of your first-grade classroom, 
watching three white children 
play with colorful plastic blocks. 
One of the kids has built a wall, 
while the other two launch blocks 
— “fireballs,” in their childish 
fantasy — at the wall, trying to 
knock it over. Turning to you, the 
boy farthest to your right urges 
you to throw a fireball, one the 
color of your skin.
“Yours would be the scariest 
because yours is black, and black 
is always the scariest,” he says. 
You reach down to pick up a 
block, then you toss it across the 
rug. The teacher, who is standing 
by a table to your left, immediately 
whips her head around and shouts 
your name. 
“Mike, look at me!” she snaps. 
“You’re being dangerous and 
you’re going to hurt someone.”

Michael Sterling is the central 
character of a virtual reality 
experience, 1000 Cut Journey, 
designed by Courtney Cogburn, 
University of Michigan alum 
and associate professor at the 
Columbia School of Social Work.
Meant to foster awareness 
of the day-to-day racism faced 
by Black Americans, 1000 Cut 
Journey walks the user through 
three different scenes, allowing 
them to experience subtle and 
overt 
racism 
from 
Sterling’s 
perspective as a child, adolescent 
and adult. 
Cogburn discussed the project 
Friday afternoon at Rackham as 
part of the Center for Academic 
Innovation’s Winter 2020 XR 
Speaker 
Series, 
an 
initiative 
showcasing developments in the 
field of virtual reality. To kick off 
her talk, titled “XR: A Critical 
Analysis and Transdisciplinary

CEDAR 
RAPIDS, 
IOWA 
— In the weeks leading up to 
the Iowa caucus, Democratic 
presidential candidates have 
crisscrossed the state. 
They’ve 
held 
rallies 
and 
town hall events and met voters 
in their own living rooms. 
They’ve mobilized voters to 
knock on doors. They’ve even 
sent surrogate supporters to 
energize voters in cities they 
can’t reach themselves. 
The Daily attended three 
rallies 
for 
three 
different 
candidates 
with 
significant 
support in Iowa in the weekend 
prior to the Iowa caucuses. 
Here’s what we saw. 
At Sanders caucus concert, 
young supporters “feel the 
Bern” 
More 
than 
2,000 
people 
gathered at the Horizons Event 
Center in suburban Des Moines, 
Iowa Friday night for the 
Bernie Sanders Caucus Concert, 
featuring popular indie folk 
band Bon Iver. 

At the rally, a crowd of 
primarily young voters drank 
beer and ate burgers while 
standing facing a large stage. 
22-year-old Allie Hoskins from 
Marion, Iowa, stood near the 
front of the crowd with a group 
of friends. She caucused for 
Sanders during her first election 
in 2016, and couldn’t wait to do 
it again on Monday. 
“It was just really fun and I’m 
excited for it again,” Hoskins 
said. “Hopefully I can instill 
that energy among my peers 
because we don’t do it as much 
as we should. Historically, we 
have the lowest turnout rates 
in the country, year after year, 
election after election. And this 
election is probably the most 
important for people our age.” 
Two 
Iowan 
folk 
bands 
kicked off the event, followed 
by speeches from documentary 
filmmaker and activist Michael 
Moore — a one-time University 
of Michigan student originally 
from Flint, Mich. — and Nina 
Turner, national co-chair of the 
Sanders campaign. 
Moore, 
who’s 
been 
campaigning 
in 
Iowa 
for 

Sanders, 
spoke 
about 
the 
similarities he’s seen between 
Iowa and his fellow Midwestern 
home state of Michigan. 
“I’ve seen Flint, Michigan, 
all across this wonderful state. 
I’ve seen and talked to so many 
people who are struggling to get 
by or tired of the old way and 
want something new,” Moore 
said. “And it’s no surprise to me 
that Bernie Sanders, for the last 
three-for-two, has been polling 
number one here in the state of 
Iowa.” 
Sanders 
had 
planned 
on 
attending the rally himself, 
but 
was 
unable 
to 
leave 
Washington, D.C. in time after 
the Senate’s impeachment trials 
of President Donald Trump on 
Friday. In a phone call lasting 
about 10 minutes and broadcast 
through 
the 
event 
center’s 
speaker system, Sanders spoke 
to the crowd about several of 
his platform points, including 
reforming the criminal justice 
system, ending the war on drugs 
and banning assault weapons. 
“We will do exactly, in our 
campaign, the opposite of what 
Trump is trying to do. He is 

trying to divide the American 
people,” Sanders said, receiving 
loud 
cheers 
from 
audience 
members. “We are gonna bring 
our 
people 
together, 
Black 
and white and Latino, Asian 
American, Native American, 
gay and straight — we’re gonna 
bring our people together.” 
He 
underscored 
the 
importance of Monday’s caucus 
— seen throughout the world as 
an omen for which candidates 
will do well in the forthcoming 
primaries, and eventually, on a 
national stage. 
“On Monday night, the entire 
country and in fact the entire 
world will be looking at the 
great state of Iowa,” he said. 
“And my humble request from 
you is to do everything that 
you can to make sure that our 
friends and neighbors come out 
and vote.” 
Following Sanders’s speech, 
progressive 
Congresswomen 
Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal 
and Ilhan Omar, who have 
all endorsed Sanders as their 
pick for Democratic nominee, 
took the stage for a short panel 
discussion about their work in 

their own communities. 
Later 
in 
the 
discussion, 
Jayapal brought up Hillary 
Clinton, 
former 
Secretary 
of 
State 
and 
presidential 
candidate, and crowd members 
began to boo at her mention. 
Panel moderator and Des 
Moines school board member 
Dionna Langford jumped in, 
saying, “We’re not going to boo, 
we’re classy here.” 
But Tlaib interjected: “No, 
no, I’ll boo … You all know I 
can’t be quiet. No, we’re going 
to boo. That’s all right, the 
haters will shut up on Monday 
when we win.”
Tlaib has since apologized 
for her response on Twitter, 
writing 
the 
“movement 
deserve(d) better.”
Following 
the 
panel 
discussion and a short speech 
from 
Jane 
Sanders, 
the 
senator’s wife, Justin Vernon, 
the Wisconsin-born front man 
of Bon Iver, took the stage for a 
solo acoustic set. 
“I was learning more and 
more about this caucus on 
Monday and it’s so important 
to get out the vote,” Vernon told 

the crowd between songs. 
Enthusiastic 
Warren 

supporters 
admire 

campaign’s empathy 
A rally for Senator Elizabeth 
Warren at the Coe College 
Kohawk Arena in Cedar Rapids 
garnered about 700 supporters 
early Saturday afternoon. 
The 
enthusiastic 
crowd 
included one supporter, Mary 
Sullivan, who came dressed as 
the Statue of Liberty. 
“(Warren’s) 
got 
health, 
she’s got experience, she’s got 
humanity. She takes good ideas 
and gives credit to the people 
who came up with them. She 
sees the whole picture and 
the details of how to make it 
happen,” Sullivan said. 
Sullivan 
has 
been 
volunteering with the Warren 
campaign since this summer 
and will be a precinct captain for 
Warren on Monday. She said she 
felt a little burnt out the other 
day after so many door-knocking 
shifts, and was amazed when an 
organizer called her to check on 
her mental health.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Senator Nina Turner and former Vice President Joe Biden campaign around Iowa the weekend before the caucus. 

NORTH 
LIBERTY, 
IOWA — After Donald 
Trump’s victory in the 
2016 presidential election, 
Ed and Jane Cranston, a 
married couple from North 
Liberty, Iowa, wanted to 
take action. The Cranstons 
decided they would begin 
by organizing what they 
call a “potluck insurgency”: 
a 
monthly 
get-together 
of 
Johnson 
County 
Democrats to talk about 
political issues and hear 
from selected speakers.
“We didn’t know what 
we were going to do,” 
Jane Cranston said. “We 
were just so upset that 
Hillary lost that we thought 
we’d just keep commiserating 
and getting together, but then 
we got speakers, people really 
loved it.”
According to Ed, who is 
serving in his first year as the 
Democratic Party Chair of 
Johnson County — the home 
of the University of Iowa and a 
Democratic stronghold in the 
state — the group was able to 
bring in major political figures 
over the course of the past year. 
He credited this partly to the 
centrality of Iowa, the first 
state to caucus during primary 
season.

The Cranstons recall one 
night in early January 2019, 
when the group had arranged 
for 
Julián 
Castro, 
former 
San Antonio mayor, to speak. 
Coincidentally, 
they 
had 
scheduled it the same day 
Castro 
indicated 
he 
would 
announce his candidacy for the 
2020 Presidential race.
“What happened was Julián 
Castro had just released that 
he was running that day,” Jane 
said. “So everybody wanted to 
cover him.”

As a result, what was intended 
to be a small get-together of 
Johnson 
County 
Democrats 
to hear Castro speak became 
so large that Jane likened it to 
the Dwarves of Middle Earth 
occupying Bilbo Baggins’ house 
in the movie “The Hobbit.” 
“It was just a crazy night,” 
Ed Cranston said. “We thought, 
‘you know, maybe we’ll get a 
little local press.’ Well, like 
an hour before it starts, Fox 
News shows up, and we had 
everybody. I mean, ABC, NBC, 

in our house. CBS, AP, Hearst 
Papers. It was packed with 75 
people. Normally we have a 
potluck, but that night was just 
going to be desserts. And it was 
so crowded they couldn’t even 
get the desserts. And then after 
they left, it was like we said, 
‘Jane — what just happened?”
“If you look up ‘Castro, 
North 
Liberty,’ 
all 
those 
(pictures) are at our house,” 
Jane added.

The nation casts its first 
vote
As the first state to vote in the 

presidential primary season, 
Iowans like the Cranstons are 
used to being overwhelmed with 
the full attention of the nation 
every four years. This year, 
with 11 Democrats remaining 
in the race and 17 dropping 
out, the political mayhem is 
particularly 
visible: 
across 
the state, visitors can observe 
canvassers knocking on doors, 
restaurants filled with out-
of-state political activists and 
stretches of Interstate 80 lined 
with campaign billboards.
For Iowans, the caucus is 
a point of pride. Not only do 
Iowans turn out for the caucus, 
but many involve themselves 
in the campaigns of their 
preferred candidates.
One such organizer is Dan 
Prescott, an Elizabeth Warren 
2020 precinct captain for Scott 
County, which also voted for 
Clinton in 2016. Prescott, a 
retired 
social 
worker, 
was 
born and raised in Ames, Iowa, 
moved to Davenport in 1973 and 
has been caucusing ever since.
“At the caucus we all have 
different roles, and my role, 
basically, is to greet people 
as they come into our caucus, 
and then I’ll have other people 
assigned to do data, to do counts 
and maybe do some persuasion, 
going out to other people in the 
caucus area and talking to them 
about what Elizabeth Warren is 
about,” Prescott said.
Prescott threw his support 
behind the Sanders campaign 
in 2016, but having always been 

a loyal Warren supporter, he 
jumped at the chance to get 
involved after she announced 
her candidacy.
“She’s 
got 
a 
plan 
for 
everything,” Prescott said. “In 
our organization office, there’s 
about 30 different plans on 
the wall with envelopes where 
you can pull out the plan and 
read it. I’ve been involved 
with 
Obama’s 
organization, 
and with Bernie Sanders, now 
with Elizabeth Warren, and 
I’ve never seen a campaign 
organized as minutely as this 
one. She plans everything.”
The gravity of the Iowa 
caucus has brought in people 
from across the country not 
just to lend their support for a 
candidate, but to observe and 
document the process. 
Jerry Trieus is a filmmaker 
from 
Toronto 
who 
was 
previously located in Kentucky, 
documenting the races there. 
But the Iowa caucus particularly 
captured his interest. This 
interest was what brought him 
to Elizabeth Warren’s rally 
Saturday in Cedar Rapids.
“I think it’s fascinating,” 
Trieus said. “It’s democracy 
live. It’s amazing. But it also 
feels kind of like a relic because 
I’ve been reading about how it 
is much harder for people at a 
disadvantage to spend all day at 
a caucus event. I think it’s both 
wonderful and a challenge.”

“I’m like, thank you! Is there 
another campaign that’s doing 
that? No!” Sullivan said. 
The 
event 
began 
with 
speeches from a Coe College 
sophomore 
and 
Iowa 
state 
representative 
Liz 
Bennett 
before 
U.S. 
Representative 
Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. got 
the crowd ready for Warren.
Warren took the stage next, 
answering questions from the 
crowd and speaking about the 
need to rebuild the government 
so it works for all Americans. 
“Fighting back is an act 
of patriotism,” Warren said. 
“Think of it this way: We fought 
back against a king to build 

this nation. We fought back 
against the scourge of slavery 
to preserve this nation. We 
fought back against the Great 
Depression to build the economy 
of this nation. And we fought 
back against fascism to protect 
our democracy in this nation. 
We are at our best when we see 
a big problem and we fight back 
with big, structural change.”
Though Warren had to rush 
off to her next campaign event 
following her speech, her dog 
Bailey Warren made himself 
available for selfies and petting 
from supporters. 
Brenda Macalister, a volunteer 
at 
Warren’s 
Cedar 
Rapids 
rally, said there were a lot of 
reasons she supported Warren. 
But as a nurse and the mother 
of a daughter who belongs to 
the LGBTQ+ community, the 

candidate’s healthcare reform 
plan and support of LGBTQ+ 
rights topped the list. 
“This is the first time I’ve 
really volunteered,” Macalister 
said. “This is the first time I’ve 
really jumped in with both feet 
for a candidate.” 
Macalister will be giving a 
speech in support of Warren 
at her precinct Monday night. 
She said this year’s caucus 
feels more important than ever 
before. 
“We have to defeat Donald 
Trump this year,” she said. “We 
just have to.” 
Biden appeals to moderate 
voters at cozy gymnasium 
rally 
Just two miles from Warren’s 
Cedar Rapids rally on Saturday 
afternoon, supporters of former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden 

crowded into the gymnasium 
of Roosevelt Creative Corridor 
Business 
Academy 
for 
an 
intimate community event. 
David Ritter, a University 
of Michigan alum and high 
school teacher in Chicago, came 
to Iowa to check out the scene 
leading up to Monday’s caucus. 
In addition to attending the Biden 
rally, he planned to see Buttigieg 
and Sanders speak as well. He 
“probably” supports Biden, though. 
“He’s got the best chance of 
beating Trump,” Ritter said. 
Still, 
he 
said 
he 
sees 
a 
generational divide when it comes 
to who supports which candidate. 
“A lot of my students like 
Buttigieg, especially, and Bernie 
Sanders,” Ritter told The Daily.

In the summer semester of 
2019, I took a Latin American 
and Caribbean Studies course 
about space and identity in 
Latin American history. For 
the final project, the class 
was 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to choose between writing a 
12-page research paper or to 
create a piece of art in relation 
to any of the material we 
learned in the class. I decided 
to make a painting of an Aztec 
woman, crying tears of blood 
because of the destruction of 
the spaces that belonged to her 
people that began in 1515 CE 
by conquistadors. New Spain 
continued to send its people to 
Mesoamerica, where the Aztecs 
resided, to build churches on

top of the Aztec temples. The 
Aztecs were forced to convert 
to Christianity. Otherwise, they 
would get killed.
Over the summer of 2018, I 
participated in a rally at Clark 
Park in which the residents 
of 
Southwest 
Detroit 
and 
surrounding 
areas 
came 
together to show support for 
those who had been detained 
by ICE. The rally consisted of 
members of the community 
talking about their relatives 
who had been detained or about 
their personal experiences. Our 
camping outside the detention 
center in Detroit delayed the 
deportation of detainees, so it 
was encouraged by the rally 
organizers. My painting, The 
Destruction of Aztec Spaces and 
Identities, similarly showcases 
the 
displacement 
of 
ethnic 
minorities.

Sunday is my day for laundry. 
My self-care day. It sounds odd 
that throwing dryer sheets 
would be my healing space, but 
it is something I will always be 
able to do for and by myself. 
I find a certain peace in the 
lonesomeness. And a certain 
endless possibility within it. 
In this time, I can be whatever 
I want. This week, I chose to 
be a listener, and I sorted my 
clothes to Nikole Hannah-
Jones’ 1619 podcast.
In the first episode, she talks 
about her childhood home. Its 
ragged form, and its constant 
need 
for 
reparation. 
Each 
floorboard is cracked and door 
unhinged. Her father doesn’t 
mind, but what he would never 
let fall into disrepair, was 
the American flag that flew 
outside. Jones couldn’t make 
sense of her father’s pride 
in something that only ever 
denied him. 
My brother was stopped by 
a cop again. By that, I mean 
my brother was speeding in 
July when a Black cop pulled 
him over. The cop’s violent 

screams piled spit on my 
brother’s shoulder like some 
sort of souvenir. Souvenir, 
in its native space, means to 
remember. Remember. You’re 

lucky I got to you first. It’s the 
reason you are still alive.
My brother was stopped 
again. By that, I mean that my 
brother Freddie Gray died in a 
police van while six Baltimore 
police, who committed the 
fatal 
injury, 
watched 
him 
sink. I mean that my unarmed 
brother Sam DuBose was shot 
on his motorcycle at a traffic 
stop in Cincinnati because 
the cop didn’t want to get run 
over. At a traffic stop. I mean 
that my brother Alton Sterling 
was pinned to the ground and 
killed for selling CDs on the 
street. I mean that they shot 
my brother Jamar Clark in the 
head in Minnesota once he had 
already been handcuffed.
In the head in Minnesota. 
Like December 26, 1862. Like 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
hanging 
Thirty Eight Men in Mnisota* 
once their land had already 
been 
stolen. 
Handcuffed. 
Hanging. When I think of 
these 38 men, I think of Sandra 
Bland. Pulled over because she 
forgot to turn on her blinker. 
Arrested 
because 
of 
her 
attitude. Dead in her cell by 
that weekend. Hanging. 
Her family had just spoken 
to her before her death. She 
said she would not give this up. 
That she would not let them 
kill her too. 
And yet, there she hanged. 
I think about my brothers 
past, and of you, knowing 
that you probably don’t know 
their names. Like how up 
until last year, I had never 
heard of the Dakota 38, or 
of Mnisota. I think of how 
Lincoln was taught to me: the 
great abolitionist, the liberator 
of me. I think of what it means 
to be free. American. Honored. 
None of these feel like words I 
can associate with myself. 
American? 
Isn’t that something we 
created for other people? Land 
we build to be beaten on? 

It never crosses my mind 
to tell people I am American. 
Like Nikole Hannah-Jones, I 
feel a sort of shame in claiming 
something that never wanted 

to claim me. When people ask 
that convoluted question of 
what are you I tell them that I 
am Black and I am Serbian. 
I capitalize Black because I 
believe it is holy. It recognizes 
all sides of my Diaspora. It 
accepts the roots laid for me 
in Africa without ignoring 
my Jamaican soul. African 
American is a settler-colonial 
term. One that denies my 
‘Americanness’ 
but 
does 
not want to understand my 
African. It straddles me in 
the Atlantic, stolen from one 
land to create another whose 
people deny me. Don’t see me. 
Or know me. 
I fold my dark laundry 
through 1619’s third episode, 
and as I throw my whites into 
the dryer, the third episode 
takes me to Wesley Morris’ 
kitchen, chopping tomatoes, 
and I feel I’m with him. His 
Pandora radio plays a genre 
called yacht rock, and as he 
listens to these white men, 
his voice lifts into awe for 
the homage their music pays 
to Black music. The body that 
lives within the music is like 
this land. Stolen. 
We can recognize the birth 
of America, but we can never 

call a Black woman the mother. 
We 
can 
recognize 
the 
birth of American music, but 
we don’t ask why this is the 
only space where we can be 
American too.
In the fourth episode, a man 
named June tells the story of 
how his bank stole his land 
from him in 2008. How they 
forged his signature and cut 
his loan prices in half so that 
they could evict him from his 
home. He talks about how 
that land was all he had. All 
his father, grandfather and 
great-grandfather had. I think 
about music. How it is all my 
ancestors had. How singing 
was what eased a day’s labor. 
How singing was the Black 
body’s 
freedom. 
Liberator. 
Protector.

Not our president.
Not our cops. 
Layli Long Soldier speaks 
on the 17-day ride held in 
memorial of the Dakota 38. 
She calls this a poem in its 
own right. I call Freddie Gray 
a poem. Sam DuBose a poem. 
Alton Sterling; poem. Jamar 
Clark; poem. Sandra Bland. 
Poetry. American. And I want 
to ask them if they would fly 
their flag or let it fall.

*The word Minnesota comes from 
mni, which means water; and sota, 
which means turbid. Mnisota is the 
original spelling of Minnesota

This past weekend, I played a 
game called “We’re Not Really 
Strangers.” For those who are 
unfamiliar, WNRS is a card 
game with various questions 
curated to help develop and 
strengthen relationships in your 
life. There are three levels to 
this game, each level consisting 
of a deck of cards with curated 
questions that you would not 
typically ask someone. These 
questions forced an inevitable 
vulnerability upon me, allowing 
me to reflect on parts of my life 
that I had grown away from and 
enabled me to empathize with 
people in my life on levels that 
were previously unavailable to 
me. 
Every question moved me, 
but of all the questions asked 
of me, there is one that I can’t 
seem to forget. The card read, 
“What is a dream you’ve let go 
of?” Before even fully grasping 
this question, memories of my 
childhood began to resurface. 
I reminisced about the wild 
careers I had dreamt of as 
a child and the extravagant 
futures I had envisioned for 
myself. Whether I was going 
to be a supermodel doctor or 
a zookeeping musician, my 
younger self placed no limits 
on the future. I dreamt freely 
— free from social expectations 
and constructs. 
As I grew older and developed 
a stronger grasp of “reality,” my 
dreams changed. I was taught 
that 
success 
meant 
having 
money and that there were a 
select number of careers that 
would guarantee my success. 
I was taught that women were 
only 
qualified 
for 
certain 
careers and that instead of 
following my dreams, I should 
find a career meant for me. I was 
taught that, as a person of color, 
I would face more obstacles 

than my white counterparts, 
so I should take whatever route 
is easiest. These “limitations” 
shaped my mind in a way that 
hindered my ability to dream 
freely. I felt that a dream career 
was one that made money and 
was socially acceptable, but not 
necessarily one that I enjoyed. 
All throughout middle school 
and high school, I hated that my 
dreams were constructed by the 
minds of others and that I no 
longer had the liberty to create 
my future.
Since 
coming 
to 
college, 
however, a lot of those restrictive 
beliefs have diminished. At the 
University of Michigan, I am 
surrounded by students with 
identities similar to my own 
who are still holding on to their 
childhood dreams instead of 
letting their “limitations” stop 
them. I have met people who 
want to start companies, run for 
office and perform in Broadway 
musicals. I have met people 
who run clothing brands, have 
interned at top companies and 
have raised thousands of dollars 
for charity. These people, along 
with countless others, have 
expanded my worldview and 
have reassured me that I can 
still become anything I want to 
be. 
I 
currently 
find 
myself 
at a point very similar to 
my 
childhood. 
Though 
my 
dreams have evolved from the 
zookeeping 
model-doctor-
musician of my childhood, they 
are still just as important. I 
am blessed to be somewhere I 
can still believe in my dreams, 
regardless of what the world 
has told me. I hope that anyone 
reading this is striving to make 
whatever dreams they have 
come true. I hope that you 
never lose sight of what you 
once wanted. And I hope that if 
you ever play WNRS and come 
across the dream question, you 
will be able to answer with 
confidence that you have not let

W 

hen I attended 
the 
Democratic 
presidential 
primary debate in Detroit in 
July 2019, I listened to Tom 
Perez, chair of the Democratic 
National Committee, deliver 
a rousing pre-show speech 
in 
which 
he 
praised 
the 
historically diverse field of 
candidates. But on Jan. 14, 
2020 — less than six months 
after the Detroit debate — 
an all-white lineup of six 
candidates took the stage for 
the final time before the Iowa 
caucuses.
The exit of Sen. Kamala 
Harris, 
D-Calif., 
from 
the 
race nearly two months ago 
was the straw that broke the 
donkey’s back in disrupting the 
Democratic Party’s “rainbow 
coalition.” According to senior 
staffer Kelly Mehlenbacher’s 
resignation letter, the Harris 
campaign was marred with 
issues 
of 
poor 
leadership 
and a crumbling strategy for 
victory. Her fate, however, was 
ultimately decided by her poor 
performance in Iowa, a state 
whose population is less than 
one percent of the U.S. total 
and 90 percent white.
Billionaire 
and 
former 
Mayor of New York City Mike 
Bloomberg, on the other hand, 
has bought his spot on the 
debate stage and scammed 
his way to fourth place in the 
polls, despite joining the race 
just a little over two months 
ago. His strategy to win the 
nomination is unprecedented 
in modern primary politics. 
His campaign intends to skip 

the 
first 
four 
nominating 
contests, held in Iowa, New 
Hampshire, Nevada and South 
Carolina, and instead focus 
on making a splash on Super 
Tuesday, when 14 states hold 
their elections. The only way 
such a strategy could work is 
with astronomical spending on 
ads, and Bloomberg is going all 
in with more than $200 million 
spent to date.

Members of the Democratic 
party must ask why a female 
senator of color was forced 
to 
prematurely 
terminate 
her campaign, while a white, 
male billionaire was able to 
buy his way into the race. Sen. 
Cory Booker, D-N.J., another 
candidate of color who recently 
suspended 
his 
campaign, 
said it best: “There’s more 
billionaires in the 2020 race 
than there are Black people.”
Harris’s 
exit 
makes 
a 
compelling case for primary 
election reform. The Iowa 
caucuses 
are 
the 
single 
most important event in the 
primary 
elections, 
hence 

why campaigns spend tens of 
millions of dollars in the state 
to build a strong ground game 
and flood the air waves with 
TV ads. Iowa is so important, 
in fact, that all but two winners 
of every Iowa caucus since 1976 
have gone on to win the party’s 
nomination.
The circumstances of the 
2020 
election 
have 
many 
pundits 
asking 
why 
Iowa 
is first. Low and behold, 
there is no real reason the 
small, Midwestern state is 
first, and in fact, the order 
of 
states 
in 
the 
primary 
calendar is arbitrary and left 
up to the states themselves. 
Analysis site FiveThirtyEight 
constructed 
a 
reordered 
Democratic primary calendar 
that 
emphasizes 
diversity 
and 
representativeness, 
and it places Illinois first. 
If 
Democrats 
are 
serious 
about not only creating, but 
maintaining, a more diverse 
field throughout their primary 
elections, then the order of 
states must be changed. 
On 
the 
top 
of 
nearly 
every Democrat’s mind in 
the 
upcoming 
elections 
is 
defeating President Trump, 
hence 
“electability” 
has 
been a topic of fierce debate. 
But without a fair primary 
calendar 
that 
reflects 
the 
diversity of the Democratic 
party, 
we 
risk 
alienating 
millions of Americans.

The rise of the Gucci belt

I

n the wake of the University 
of Michigan’s first Winter 
term sorority recruitment, a 
picture has surfaced with a line of 
underclassmen girls all wearing 
Canada Goose jackets. Memes 
aside, this picture reflects a much 
bigger story that has affected 
college campuses around the 
country. Encountering groups of 
couture-wearing college students 
is becoming more and more 
common. Why is it that over the 
past few years millennials and 
Gen Zers have witnessed the 
rise of the Gucci belt? What does 
it mean that the haute couture 
clothing brands once sought after 
by working professionals are now 
commonplace for college students?
I find it’s difficult to discuss 
this topic without making some 
concessions: I’m a proud owner 
of a Gucci belt. I will also concede 
that I do, in fact, feel as if I’m slowly 
inching closer to hell with each 
buckle around my waist. There’s 
nothing 
wrong 
with 
owning 
couture, unnecessary things. It’s 
OK to want them, to purchase 
them and to wear them. It’s the 
resulting attitude and increased 
self-worth that is not.
I look at myself in the mirror 
that hangs on the back of my dorm 
room door before leaving for class 
every day. Often, it’s hard to look 
beyond the clothes I’m wearing and 
focus on me. Do I look happy? Do I 
look comfortable? I have pushed 
questions like these to the side in 
pursuit of a societal inclination to 
feel self-assured through what I’m 
wearing. What I want to explore is 
“why?”
With 
social 
media 
at 
our 
fingertips, younger generations are 
left to strive for an Instagram-able 
life. We crave an aesthetic that will 
bring us likes and attention. This 
aesthetic is comprised of expensive, 
brand-name clothing, artificially 
tanned skin and airbrushed makeup. 
The rise of microcelebrities makes 
these lavish lifestyles much more 
attainable than the past celebrity 
culture of movie stars in Tinseltown. 
On a daily basis, social media users 
interact with content posted directly 
by Kylie Jenner and James Charles. 
We model their behavior, whether 
we are fans of them or not. It’s 
human nature to subliminally desire 
acceptance from our peers and our 
idols.

When 
a 
celebrity 
posts 
pictures with designer brands 
on every inch of their body, we 
applaud before checking our debit 
accounts wondering how much 
deeper we can go before PNC 
Bank comes to hunt us down. On 
the flip side, when Selena Gomez 
flaunts her DIY tie-dye shirt, the 
world simultaneously gasps. It’s 
as if celebrities are not allowed 
to be real people, and if they try 
to be, we deem them “down to 
earth” or “relatable.” The problem 
lies here: Why are fashion choices 
such a grand statement in the first 
place? Why do we continue to 
grow more fixated on the money 
you spend instead of the money 
you save, sustain or donate? 
Business Insider’s Jessica Tyler 

analyzed Gucci’s recent surge in 
success, noting that in the first 
half of 2018, nearly 55 percent 
of Gucci sales were made to 
consumers under 35 years old. 
Do we even like the Gucci logo? 
Do we like what it stands for? Do 
we like what it suggests about us 
or our wallets? Do we like that 
it reflects our ability to keep up 
with the chaotic culture we live, 
tweet and breathe in?
Maybe it’s time to ignore 
the noise and genuinely wear 
what makes you feel good about 
yourself. 
I’m 
not 
suggesting 
we all dive headfirst into the 
#makeinstagramcasualagain 
movement, though I do think 
there is a lot to say about it.
I am all for keeping up with 
trends, whether it be fashion 
or otherwise. It is curious, 
however, to analyze why Gucci, 
in particular, has skyrocketed 
in the past few years. Recently, 

fashion has seen a resurgence 
in ’90s style. Gucci certainly has 
noticed this and capitalized on it, 
even headlining their campaign 
with the modern Mick Jagger, 
Harry Styles. When Gucci was 
originally founded in 1921, it 
was meant to appeal to the 
upper-class for horseback riding. 
Since its equestrian beginnings, 
Gucci became largely popular 
with 
glamorous 
people 
like 
Jackie Kennedy, and now is 
transitioning to appeal to the 
modern 
millennial 
audience. 
This means a heavy emphasis 
on 
pops 
of 
color, 
patterns 
and the signature looped “G” 
symbol. This all ties into the 
societal pressure to establish an 
Instagram aesthetic: Gucci has 
simply paid attention, done their 
homework and become the brand 
to beat.
In writing this I’m walking 
a fine line between sounding 
like a hypocrite or a snob, but I 
don’t think there needs to be a 
Gucci-burning 
ceremony 
just 
yet. Instead, ensure that you’re 
wearing something because you 
want to and not because you feel 
you need to. Life is more than 
posts 
on 
Instagram, 
despite 
how hard it is to remove the lens 
of filters, friend requests and 
followers that fill our eyes even 
when our phones are out of sight. 
I love my Gucci belt, among other 
superfluous, unnecessary things. 
I acknowledge my ownership of 
these items, but it does not come 
close to comprising who I am. I 
am extremely grateful that I have 
access to couture products, but 
I’m unapologetically much more 
than the brands I choose to wear.
I find that on a college campus 
as eclectic and elite as U-M, 
balance has to be a priority to 
avoid falling into a pit of needing 
to fit in. At the end of the day, we 
don’t need Gucci to be a member 
of Lil Pump’s “Gucci Gang,” nor 
do we need a (Canada) Goose 
to be part of the flock. We’re 
here and whatever clothing or 
accessories we choose to display 
do not have to be in accordance 
with the latest celebrity trend, 
though it’s certainly OK if they 
are.

T 

he government doesn’t 
work 
anymore. 
Politicians 
of 
all 
stripes decry the fact 
that no one wants to 
get 
anything 
done. 
Representatives 
and 
senators 
don’t 
compromise 
because 
they have no incentive 
to do so. This was not 
always the case.
Prior 
to 
2011, 
there was something 
known as legislative 
earmarks. 
These 
were extra provisions 
politicians attached to bills that 
directed the spending of federal 
dollars to their state and/or 
district. The reason for these 
provisions was that they served 
as a way to whip votes for a 
certain legislative vehicle/text 
— some representative would get 
some funding for their district 
and would then vote in favor of 
the bill. In 2011 the Republicans 
— who had just won the U.S. 
House of Representatives — and 
then-Speaker 
John 
Boehner 
decided to get rid of earmarks. 
The practice was and is seen as 
inviting corruption and enabling 
the special interest takeover 
of 
Congress, 
among 
other 
complaints. What has happened 
since Boehner abolished the 
process 
demonstrates 
that 
government with earmarks is 
far preferable to government 
without.
Gridlock has been a problem in 
Congress since 2011 in a way that 
it wasn’t before. This is because 
there are two main ways to get a 
vote from a congressperson — a 
carrot and a stick. The earmark 
was the most common carrot. It 
was a way to get congresspeople 
to vote “yes” by giving them 
a reason to cooperate even if 
they and their district might be 
opposed. The other way to get 
votes is with sanction or threat of 
sanction — the stick. The problem 
with banning earmarks is that 
the most effective carrot was 
taken away, and thus, the stick 
became the primary method of 
persuasion. The problem with 
this is that a stick is a pretty poor 

way to uphold cooperation in any 
arena, and the political one is no 
exception. 
Take government 
funding 
bills 
and 
other 
kinds 
of 
appropriation bills as 
examples. Everyone 
wants 
their 
voice 
heard and is willing 
to say no to the bill. 
Legislative 
riders 
(extra 
provisions 
attached to a bill 
with little to do with 
the 
original 
bill) 
solved this problem 
— people were far less likely 
to say no if their vote got them 
something for their district. Even 
if their district might disagree 
for ideological reasons, coming 
home with federal dollars might 
make a disagreeable vote a little 
bit more acceptable.

Once legislative earmarks were 
banned, however, the incentive 
to 
cooperate 
disappeared 
to 
an extent: If you’re not getting 
something 
you 
want, 
why 
compromise 
with 
anyone? 
Earmarks, or riders directing 
the spending of federal dollars, 
solved this prisoner’s dilemma — 
they made cooperation attractive 
because people got something 
tangible 
for 
cooperating 
— whether it be money for 
infrastructure, 
agriculture 
or 
another need in their district.
Earmarks, 
however, 
were 
not perfect. There were some 
problems with the system that 
were slowly but surely addressed. 
For example, prior to 2007, 
members did not need to publicly 
disclose their requests. This was 
reversed by the Democrats upon 

taking the House in 2006. The 
reason for the reversal was that 
the old way could lead to illegal 
activities, such as bribery — and 
it did in the cases of former Rep. 
Randy 
“Duke” 
Cunningham, 
R-Calif., and Jack Abramoff. 
The two served time in prison, 
and rather than do further work 
on fixing the earmark process, 
Congressional 
Republicans 
abolished the practice in 2011. 
That has led to a decade 
of gridlock. When President 
Donald 
 
Trump 
suggested 
the House consider bringing 
them back, reactions were 
mixed. Certain Republicans 
and 
conservative 
groups 
were opposed to the idea, 
citing complaints about crony 
capitalism. However, others 
were open to the idea as a way 
to get the government working 
again. The chair of the Senate 
Appropriations 
Committee, 
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., 
has come out in support of 
a kind of earmarks along 
with ranking member Sen. 
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Though 
Democratic views were also 
mixed, they tended to support 
the reestablishment of the 
process. It did not happen at 
the start of the 116th Congress, 
but the interest was clearly 
there from senior officials 
like 
House 
Appropriations 
Chair Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., for 
bringing them back at some 
point in the future. 
Politics is a process and 
it takes time. However, the 
removal 
of 
appropriations 
broke the process in a way that 
has not been done before and 
consequently 
grounded 
the 
wheels of government to a halt. 
Getting those wheels turning 
again 
will 
take 
bipartisan 
agreement because there are not 
enough votes on either side to 
abolish the legislative filibuster. 
Earmarking is the best way 
to cultivate that agreement. 
Democrats (and Republicans) 
should lose no time in bringing 
back the practice.

It 
would 
be 
dishonest 
to 
say that my decision to go to 
Sundance wasn’t at least mildly 
(okay, heavily) influenced by the 
fact that superstar Taylor Swift’s 
documentary, “Miss Americana,” 
would be screened at the festival 
before its Jan. 31 Netflix release. 
As the kickoff to the film festival, 
“Miss Americana” was one of 
the hottest tickets in Park City; 
its premiere saw lines wrapping 
around the block in the cold Utah 
winter, hundreds of people waiting 
for the chance to catch a glimpse 
of Swift and/or her movie. Many 
were fans, but as an introduction 
to the screening told us, you don’t 
have to be a fan of Swift to enjoy 
this movie. And, if you’re not a 
fan, this film is certain to make 
you one. This sentiment could not 
have rang more true — even before 
the lights came on, the theater 
was buzzing with admiration 
and excitement for this deeply 
personal and moving peek into the 
life of such a polarizing musician.
“Miss Americana” opens on 
Swift playing the piano in her New 
York City apartment while her 
kitten, Benjamin, strolls across the 
keys. As the camera follows the 
adorable blue-eyed feline, Swift’s 
voice comes in, setting the stage 
for what evidently becomes the 
theme of the documentary. 
“My entire moral code is a need 
to be thought of as ‘good,’” she says 
while perched on a city-facing 
window sill. As a montage of home 
movies and early performances 
plays, 
Swift 
describes 
her 
desperate 
need 
for 
approval, 
how she used to need applause 
and validation to feel good about 
herself. All she ever tried to be 

was the polite girl who smiled and 
made it easy to sell records, and it 
kept working. That is, of course, 
until it didn’t.
The documentary takes a turn 
with the infamous 2009 incident, 
when Kanye West interrupted a 
teenage Taylor Swift onstage at 
the VMAs. Swift says that at the 
time she didn’t know everyone in 
the crowd was booing Kanye. She 
thought the arena was booing her, 
piercing her desperately needed 
veil of approval and shaping the 
way she viewed her life from then 
on.
In 
a 
post-screening 
Q&A, 
documentary 
director 
Lana 
Wilson revealed that she and 
Swift 
had 
specifically 
talked 
about 
making 
sure 
the 
film 
didn’t come off as propaganda 
or marketing. This explains how 
deeply and surprisingly personal 
the documentary gets. Viewers 
see Swift talking about everything 
from her history with eating 
disorders to her mother’s growing 
cancer to the crushing loneliness 
of 
stardom. 
These 
moments, 
woven 
between 
scenes 
of 
a 
sparkling, smiling Swift on stage 
at her various tours, take what 
could’ve been just another pop star 
documentary and elevate it to a 
level rarely achieved by the genre.
The most touching and talked 
about scene of the film comes when 
Swift decides she wants to come 
out in support of Phil Bredeson, 
the Tennessee Democrat who 
ran against Marcia Blackburn, 
a woman who Swift describes 
as “Trump in a wig,” in the 2018 
midterm election. In a room with 
her mother, father and three men 
from her management team, Swift 
holds back tears describing what 
she feels are unforgivable views 
held by Blackburn. As her father 
and management beg her not 
speak out, she breaks down over 

not publicly coming out against 
Trump in 2016, finally proclaiming 
that this is just “something I have 
to do.”
There is some valid criticism to 
be made here. Swift’s activism is 
one of comfort, done with a glass 
of wine in an expensive home. 
But the framing of her political 
coming-out within the theme of 
the documentary squashes these 
concerns. Swift is less of a couch 
activist with a savior complex and 
more of a powerful woman finally 
breaking out of the ties that she has 
been bound by for fifteen years. 
From the beginning of the doc to 
the end, we see Swift no longer 
care about approval, applause and 
awards, but about what she wants 
and how she wants to do it.
Within the film are plenty more 
moments and scenes that warrant 
their own article, but with a fast-
approaching release date, such 
details are not necessary. The 
whispers heard while walking out 
of the film were of varied praise — 
from super fans crying over details 
they’ve always wanted, to old men 
who couldn’t name three Swift 
songs praising the rawness and 
charm of the flick. With its humor 
and heartbreak, “Miss Americana” 
is the story of a normal, outcasted 
teenage girl who just so happened 
to get famous.
—Samantha Della Fara, Daily 
Arts Writer

To quote my mom: “Taylor 
Swift is a smart girl.”
And no, not in that calculated, 
strategic way that, as Swift herself 
explains, is negatively associated 
with women, but rather in a 
genuinely intelligent and informed 
way that proves she knows what 
she’s doing as a businesswoman, 
citizen, role model and human.
Nothing 
demonstrates 
her 
intelligence more than Swift’s 

recently 
released 
Netflix 
documentary “Miss Americana.” 
Director 
Lana 
Wilson 
(“The 
Departure”) uses the documentary 
as an opportunity to peel back the 
layers of Taylor Swift to see what 
she is really like beyond her catchy 
songs and exhilarating concerts; 
Swift reclaims the narrative of her 
life story in this documentary. In 
some incredibly touching scenes 
we see her interact with her family, 
and we get peeks into her studio 
where she and her collaborators 
work on the lyrical and musical 
processes behind her songs. 
“Miss Americana” is full of 
intense moments, like her decision 
to come out about her political 
beliefs and her mother’s cancer 
struggles, but those are evenly 
dispersed with happy moments 
too. Wilson carefully manages a 
then timeline and a now timeline, 
with the then moments being 
Swift’s struggles and the now 
moments being, naturally, her life 
now, where she is happier than 
she has been in a long time and 
more connected with what really 
matters to her. 
Wilson follows the timeline of 
Swift’s 13-year career: She inserts 
clips of Swift performing the 
national anthem as a child, the 
launch of her career with her song 
“Tim McGraw,” her numerous 

awards beginning with the album 
Fearless and ending with pop music 
sensation 1989, and her struggle to 
be “a good girl.” But then we see 
something different: the sadness 
that once lurked deep beyond 
Swift’s surface, sadness that was 
never apparent on her face or in 
her speeches. We see how things 
like the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty 
affected her, how Kanye West’s 
song “Famous” hurt her, how 
paparazzi 
photos 
and 
media 
remarks led to an eating disorder 
and how her sexual assault case 
left her paranoid and eager to 
change how women are treated. 
Following 
those 
events, 
it 
makes sense that Swift would 
want to change herself, not just 
through her music with the 
release of reputation, but also 
personally and publicly as a 
political spokesperson. In one 
of the most hard-hitting scenes 
of the documentary, Swift fights 
against her management team and 
her father when she declares she 
wants to speak out during the 2018 
midterm elections. She says she 
wants people to understand why 
Marsha Blackburn should not be 
in power, citing Blackburn’s lack 
of support for the Violence Against 
Women 
Act 
and 
Blackburn’s 
homophobic 
beliefs. 
Everyone 
begs her not to make such a risky 

decision, but Swift says she has to 
“be on the right side of history,” or 
at least try. And she does. She risks 
her career, but more importantly 
her safety, to try to make a 
difference. It may not have turned 
out the way she hoped, but we saw 
her make an effort, which is more 
than many entertainers do. 
We also see the effect of the 
midterm election on Swift’s music. 
Last year she came out with the 
song “Miss Americana and the 
Heartbreak Prince,” which is 
saturated with political metaphors 
and is also the song for which 
the documentary is named, but 
with this film she also releases 
clips of her creating a new song 
“Only the Young,” which was 
released with the documentary. 
The song, written for and about 
the youth affected by Trump and 
other Republicans’ detrimental 
political decisions , references 
school shootings among other 
horrific events. But, as Swift sings, 
“only one thing can save us / only 
the young.” Backed by children’s 
voices, 
the 
song 
emphasizes 
what 
Swift 
explains 
in 
her 
documentary: the need to take part 
in politics and create change in the 
world, through music, politics or 
otherwise.

“I asked, ‘Dizzy, do you 
know anybody here in New 
York that could give me some 
voice training?’ He cursed me 
out. I can’t say what he told me, 
he told me off so good.”
Yes, of course, Miss Mavis 
Staples 
— 
Freedom 
Rider, 
daughter of Pops Staples, the 
woman who was proposed 
to by Bob Dylan and never 
married him — was cursed 
out by famed jazz trumpeteer 
Dizzy 
Gillespie 
for 
asking 
about voice training. Of course.
“He said, ‘You already got it! 
What the hell you talkin’ about? 
You don’t need no voice coach, 
you already got it. You leave 
it alone,’” her laugh bubbled 
through the phone. “I’m going 
to do like Dizzy said, ‘Leave it 
alone, let it be.‘”
British mag New Musical 
Express declared in 2018 that 
“There is no sound on Earth 
more joyful than Mavis Staples 
singing, except maybe Mavis 
Staples laughing.” My God, 
how real that is. I have written 
and 
rewritten 
nonsense 

phrases about how warm and 
full and true her laugh is, but 
nothing I write will ever do it 
justice.

I 
recently 
had 
the 
opportunity to speak with 
Staples in anticipation of her 
Feb. 15 performance at The 

Breakfast at St. Andrews. This 
program was created in the ’80s 
to help combat the economic 
recession, and volunteers now 
serve nearly 150 meals daily.
“Look at that! That‘s enough 
to keep anybody afloat,” she 
said of the Breakfast. “For you 
guys to be feeding the hungry, 
the less fortunate, every day 
since 1982, that‘s incredible. 
That is awesome. I’m coming 
over there and getting me a 
meal.”
“I’ve lost my family,” she 
said, “but I haven’t lost them. I 
still talk to them — I still talk 
to Pops, and different things 
I see remind me of my sisters, 
and I have our music. I can 
hear their voices, I have videos, 
I watch the tapes, and I smile. 
So, I get along fine.”
To live in the face of 
impossible 
grief, 
to 
trust 
yourself enough to not only 
carry on, but to create — I’ve 
never known faith that hard, 
that honest, that good.
“My 
family, 
we 
started 
singing 
gospel 
songs, 
and 
that’s telling the truth,” she 
said. “Gospel is truth.”
“There’s 
something 
happening here,” she dropped 
to Buffalo Springfield in her 

heavy vibrato. “You know, 
and these lyrics, they were 
dynamite to us ... ‘There’s a 
man with a gun over there, 
telling me I’ve got to beware’ 
... This is what we’re supposed 
to be doing, singing these 
songs.”
Her voice is honey on tough 
toast, milk in morning coffee. 
She 
disrupts 
the 
delusion 
that resilient people can’t feel 
scared or soft or sad. They just 
have to know who they are.
“My life is full,” she said. 
“I’ve been married, divorced, 
all that stuff. So, you know, I 
don’t want for nothing. I don’t 
crave for anything that I can’t 
have.”
I asked about the 2018 
Newport 
Folk 
Fest, 
where 
she sang “The Weight” with 
the likes of Marcus Mumford, 
Brandi 
Carlile, 
Phoebe 
Bridgers and Maggie Rogers. 
For context: People (plural) 
texted me “Are you OK??” after 
the 
performance 
surfaced 
online.
ose ladies that you named,” 
she said, “Maggie, Brandi, 
Phoebe — they are the future. 
They’re coming strong, they’re 
coming strong.”
“I love the young ladies 
that are coming along,” she 
continued. “They are so sincere 
in what they’re doing, and 
they’re good writers. They’re 
such good writers. This little 
girl, Kacey? Kacey Musgraves.” 
My gasp was almost shrill. “I 
love them to pieces.”
We 
talked 
about 
Norah 
Jones and Joni Mitchell and 
The Highwomen. She’s selfless 
without being self-righteous, 
honest but never mean. She 
told me about Madison Square 
Garden and her fitness center 
and at some point, I forgot I 
was talking to Mavis Staples 
and I asked her for advice.
“You’re going to be great 
in whatever you do,” she said. 
“Just tell yourself that ... 
Believe in yourself and know 
that you are following the right 
trail, the trail that you want to 
follow.”
I could have cried (I did).
“Nobody else can tell you 
what you want to do, it’s up 
to you. And if you do that, if 
you believe — all things are 
possible if only you believe. 
All things are possible. So you 
carry on, and if you need some 
help, you call Mavis.”

University Symphony Orchestra 
recently 
hosted 
their 
first 
performance of 2020 at Hill 
Auditorium. Conducted by School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance faculty 
Kenneth Kiesler and composed of 
University students, the group is 
an elegant portrayal of the musical 
talent of both the student body and 
the faculty who guide them.
The first piece was George 
Gershwin’s incredibly lively “Cuban 
Overture.” 
Featuring 
drums 
and shakers uncharacteristic of 
a symphonic performance, its 
paced 
transitions 
between 
slow 
and 
fast 
playing 
mimicked a sense 
of day and night in 
an intriguing way. I 
felt as though I was 
being drawn onto 
the stage with the 
pushes and pulls of 
the music. I could 
have sworn that in 
the midst of “Cuban 
Overture,” I heard a 
hint of the melody 
of “Rhapsody in 
Blue,” 
another 
piece written by 
Gershwin. Perhaps 
this 
musical 
interlude 
was 
intentional, 
or, 
perhaps, I was just overzealous to 
hear my favorite Gershwin piece 
live for the first time.
“A banjo?” I turned to some 
friends who had accompanied me 
to the event. They shared the same 
curiosity. The instrument is not 
typically part of the symphonic 
artillery, so we were eager to hear 
its place in “Rhapsody in Blue.” As 
it turned out, though, the banjo did 
not play a large role in the piece, 
and I was disappointed that USO 
had not implemented a banjo solo in 
their rendition of the historic piece.
One of my favorite parts of 
“Rhapsody in Blue” is the piano. 
On piano for USO was none other 
than Logan Skelton, a pianist 
and composer with an expansive 

resume 
including 
stints 
with 
the Manhattan School of Music 
and Missouri State University. 
Currently, Skelton is the Professor 
of Piano and Director of Doctoral 
Studies in Piano Performance here 
at the University of Michigan. As I 
learned during the performance, 
Skelton is a contributor to The 
George and Ira Gershwin Critical 
Edition of “Concerto in F” and 
“Rhapsody in Blue,” and his 
expertise on the piece shined 
through during his performance. A 
dichotomy of strong and light was 
evident in his playing, mimicking 
the overall mood of pieces like 
“Rhapsody in Blue.”
The final piece, “Symphonic 
Dances, op. 45,” 
written in 1940, 
was a set from 
one of my favorite 
composers, 
Sergei 
Rachmaninoff 
. 
This set featured 
dichotomous 
shifts throughout 
each 
featured 
piece from “op. 
45,” 
with 
a 
defined blend of 
bass and treble, 
soft and harsh 
and hurried and 
relaxed.
The 
USO 
performance was 
a night of dichotomies, featuring 
masterful shifts from slow to fast, 
day to night, bass to treble, soft 
to abrupt, tense to relaxed and 
strong to light. Though these can 
be explicitly written down in the 
sheet music, it can be very difficult 
to actually embody those shifts 
or those moods. Without a doubt, 
this was the best performance 
from any group at the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance that I have 
attended, and much of that is due to 
the execution of those important 
shifts in feeling. I applaud Kiesler, 
Skelton and the USO for hitting the 
nail on the head with these complex 
pieces.
USO’s next performance will 
be held on February 24th at Hill 
Auditorium.

Kesha Sebert came off of her 
third EP, Rainbow, gently. The 2017 
release was a work that Sebert had 
spent nearly five years writing 
and recording, all while engaged 
in a legal struggle with her record 
producer — the now disgraced Dr. 
Luke — over sexual misconduct and 
emotional abuse. The album was 
finally released at just a time when 
the early-2010s sensual, bubblegum 
pop crowd was officially stepping 
back into the curtain, rescinding 
domination of the music industry 
to either newcomers or their few 
compatriots 
who 
had 
evolved 
enough to fit the day. On Rainbow, 
Kesha best engaged the latter 
action, pointedly changing her 
tone and style, though less out 
of necessity than some of her 
colleagues. 
Rainbow 
emerged 
as a soft-pop triumph, with the 
dial ratcheted toward a country 
ambiance and toward a raw, open 
vulnerability that somehow — 
party girls have emotions, too? — 
shocked critics. “I used to live in 
the darkness,” Kesha sings on the 
album’s eponymous track. “Dress in 
black, act so heartless. But now / I 

see the colors are everything.”
Cognizant of her fans and of 
the tonal shift she applied in 2017, 
then, Sebert branded her new EP, 
High Road, as a return to the wild, 
carefree strength of her first album. 
The lead single, “Raising Hell,” 
recalled the heavy production 
and bass of earlier albums. It 
re-rehearsed the “fuck it” attitude 
that framed Kesha for success 
in the first place. Kesha sampled 
champagne in magazine interviews 

and brought back her hair dye. In 
November, she said that it was the 
album where “Kesha got her balls 
back.”
On the first listen, too, it feels this 
way. She’s back, the album shouts. 
It’s ferocious. “I’m getting so drunk 
/ Haven’t seen my boyfriend in a few 
months / Oh, don’t know if it’s weed 
or if it’s a skunk,” Kesha sings on 
“Tonight.” Even her voice, it seems, 

has returned to its low, brooding 
rap-growl so indicative of her early 
work. The electropop has dulled, 
but the relentless bass and rhythm 
typical of radio pop is as strong as 
ever. It’s dirty, ungovernable and 
most of all, fun.
The 
problem 
with 
Sebert’s 
assessment of the album — “Kesha 
got her balls back” — is that 
Kesha never lost them to begin 
with. Sure, Rainbow was a shift 
in genre, turning slowly to low-fi
 
pop and guitar-laden tracks. But 
the vulnerability and authentic 
dialogue that Rainbow opened 
up — on emotional abuse, self-
healing and forgiveness — were not 
symptoms of weakness. If anything, 
they were testaments to Kesha’s 
resilience. They exemplified her 
balls-to-the-wall 
gallantry 
that 
enabled her to face her abuser when 
the system left her behind, and what 
allowed her to, largely before music 
and politics were as wedded as they 
are today, speak out on contentious 
social issues. The notion that a 
definite dichotomy exists between 
the sex-positive, alcohol-glugging 
party girl and the forgiving, love-
struck one that emerged in Sebert’s 
later career is asinine. The two are 
not mutually exclusive.

For Kesha, the ‘High Road’ 
doesn’t mean weakness

ALBUM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

JOHN DECKER
Managing Arts Editor

I can’t think of a better way 
to describe Italo Disco than 
Ishkur in his infamous book, 
“Guide to Electronic Music.” 
Considering this mysterious 
figure’s hatred for seemingly 
half the genres he writes about, 
he has effusive praise for Italo, 
describing it as “what happens 
when creativity, inspiration 
and raw ambition vastly exceed 
technical limitations.”
Before 
getting 
into 
the specifics of how that 
description rings true, listen 
to this. Or this. This? Does 
any of this even seem real? 
Is it even possible to make 
music this … sincerely joyful 
yet also dumb and campy? 
It’s impossible to look away at 
the sheer absurdity. I suppose 
many people would label it 
(rightfully so?) as unbearably 
cheesy, 
the 
polar 
opposite 
of what anybody, anywhere 
would consider “cool.” Is this 
the depravity our generation 
is meant to rebel against? All 
questions to ponder. 
Note that all the descriptions 
above are not meant to broadly 
apply to the entire genre of 
disco itself, despite a multi-
generational 
anathema 
stemming from the 1979 Disco 
Demolition Night in Chicago. 
For heaven’s sake, listen to 
this. There were tremendously 
gifted 
musicians 
making 
disco 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
incorporating technical skills 
with 
experimentation 
with 
the latest synths and drum 
machines. 
However, 
when 
America 
decided to collectively shun the 
entire genre in the ’80s, some 
creative Europeans bemoaned 
the lack of quality releases to 
play at clubs. Inspired by the 

Giorgio Moroders and Patrick 
Crowleys of the world, as well 
as by a flood of cheaper tech, 
they decided to carry its mantle 
themselves, production quality 
be 
damned. 
Their 
drums 
would sound incredibly tinny, 
they would abuse the ARP 
Odyssey synthesizer and they 
would sing in English like all 
their favorite artists from the 
genre’s birthplace (no matter 
how comfortable they were 
with the language). DJs at clubs 

in resort towns like Rimini in 
the northeast of Italy would 
spin the continuous deluge of 
new records to great acclaim to 
the dancers who appreciated 
the genre’s catchiness despite 
the lack of high musicianship 
or “sophistication.” 
One 
record 
label 
in 
particular decided to collect 
and distribute this burgeoning 
genre across the European 
mainland. Called ZYX Records 

and based out of Germany, its 
founder Bernhard Mikuliski 
actually 
coined 
the 
term 
“italo.” In terms of spreading 
the infectiously catchy, yet 
amateurish 
sound 
of 
the 
multitudes of Italians making 
this type of music at the time, 
no label was more influential. 
A recurring theme I noticed 
while perusing the genre’s 
extensive catalogs and playlists 
is that for a lot of artists, it was 
quite difficult to find more 
than one or two truly listenable 
tracks. But it would be a 
disservice to label these tracks 
merely as “listenable” because 
they were still marvelous. It 
begs the question, who exactly 
were these people making 
Italo? Were they just amateurs 
who stumbled upon gold then 
eventually gave it all up to 
become doctors? 
Despite the vitriol, many 
held against the genre even 
during its peak, its glorious 
triumphs have had a lasting 
impact on the world of dance 
music. The genre evolved into 
genres like Hi-NRG, which 
continued the production of 
catchy, futuristic music with 
no shortage of camp. The early 
sounds of house and techno 
in the late 1980s and early 
1990s took inspiration from 
the genre’s sounds, and more 
importantly, the ethos of just 
going out there and purchasing 
synths and drum machines to 
make innovative tunes. 
Surprisingly, 
the 
genre 
survives to this day, with 
enterprising 
DJs 
digging 
through its extensive back 
catalog as well as through labels 
like Johnny Jewel’s Italians 
Do It Better. No matter how 
critically panned it was during 
its heyday, there’s no denying 
that Italo helped change the 
culture 
surrounding 
dance 
music and pave the way for 
even more talented, influential 
musicians.

‘M’ tops 
Rutgers

NEW YORK — In the seven seasons 
leading up to Saturday, Madison Square 
Garden has become a home away from 
home for the Michigan men’s basketball 
team.
The last time the Wolverines walked 
off the floor, it was with the 2018 Big Ten 
Tournament title in hand. Prior to that, 
they scored wins over Marquette and 
Southern Methodist at the 2K Classic in 
2016. Overall, Michigan entered Saturday 
riding a nine-game winning streak in New 
York since 2012.
And against No. 25 Rutgers (16-6 overall, 
7-4 Big Ten) on Saturday, the Wolverines 
extended the streak to double-digits 
with a 69-63 win. There wasn’t a trophy 
on the line this time, but the magnitude 
of securing a ranked win in an uber-
competitive Big Ten could shake out to be 
an important inflection point.
After a rocky start that saw the Scarlet 
Knights score 12 of the game’s first 19 
points, Michigan (13-8, 4-6) found its 
footing on defense. The Wolverines 
tightened their interior presence, forcing 
Rutgers into a five-minute scoring drought 
as it missed 13 of its next 15 shots.
On the opposite end of the floor, 
sophomore forward Brandon Johns Jr. — 
who entered the game shooting 29 percent 
from beyond the arc — made three of his 
first four 3-point attempts. Freshman wing 
Franz Wagner and junior guard Eli Brooks 
also buried threes, propelling Michigan to 
a 20-5 run.
The most vicious punch, though, came 
midway through the run. As senior point 
guard Zavier Simpson peeled off a double 
screen at the top of the key, he whipped a 
bounce pass between the Scarlet Knights’ 
double-team.
He threaded the needle as well as 
possible, as he’s done so many times 
before. The ball found the waiting hands 
of senior center Jon Teske, who used his 
six-inch height advantage to throw down a 
thunderous one-handed flush over Rutgers 
guard Caleb McConnell.
A few minutes later, Johns tipped in a 
missed free throw at the halftime buzzer, 
giving Michigan a three-point lead going 
into the break.
It also gave Johns his 14th and 15th 
points of the opening half, capping off 
his best half of college basketball to date. 
Behind his 15 points on 5-of-8 shooting, 
the Wolverines were able to weather the 
10 offensive rebounds and seven second-
chance points they allowed.
That rebounding gap, however, kept the 
halftime lead from ballooning.
“(Rutgers) is an excellent offensive 
rebounding team,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said. … “They’re going to attack 
the glass because they’re long, they’re 
athletic and they’re quick. They also have 
two bigs — particularly (Myles) Johnson — 
who’s super long, and he goes to the glass to 
clean up everything.”
When Michigan needed a second-half 
spark, it once again turned to Johns, who 
answered the call with a two-handed dunk 
and a corner three to extend the lead to 
eight.
Howard has been clear in his desire 
to breathe confidence into Johns since 
the summer. With junior forward Isaiah 
Livers injured once again, his role now 
becomes even more pivotal.
The trajectory of Johns’ steady season-
long climb reached yet another climax on 
Saturday, when he led all scorers with 20 
points.
“This is something that’s happened all 
season long,” Howard said. “Game by game 
— this is not just for today. Brandon’s been 
playing great for us all year. … But points 
is not what shows up — winning, that’s 
effort. It’s attention to detail. Being there 
defensively, being able to guard above the 
4, being a rim protector at the basket.”
Johns’ teammates took the reins from 
there, as Wagner and Teske each scored a 
pair of baskets as Michigan built a 14-point 
edge. Simpson found himself at the center 
of the run, racking up 10 assists in his first 
game back from suspension.
Missing a game for the first time in his 
career put Simpson in an odd predicament. 
As the face of the program, he’s usually the 
one supporting his teammates, but this 
week, the roles were reversed.
“It’s pretty much that (the team) had my 
back (with) positive feedback,” Simpson 
said. “Stuff that not just teammates, that 
a brotherhood does. At the same time, 
that’s what makes us. I feel like we’re a 
brotherhood.”
The Wolverines forced misses down 
the stretch, but struggled to keep Rutgers 
off the offensive glass. The Scarlet Knights 
outscored Michigan by 19 in second-
chance points, but it wasn’t enough to 
mount a comeback.
It was enough, however, to put the 
Wolverines in a spot similar to where they 
found themselves against Illinois and 
Oregon — two narrow losses from earlier 
this season. This time, Michigan held on.
And, with it, Howard was finally able to 
let out a sigh.

N

EW YORK — If this is what 
a turning point looks like, 
Michigan will take it.
Last week was ugly. It brought 
an urgency that should never have 
been required for two mid-winter 
games. It started with a bomb that, 
in the moment, 
seemed as if it 
could be a final 
blow for Juwan 
Howard’s 
first season in 
charge. It ended 
with an escape, 
a buzzer sound-
ing and a palpa-
ble exhortation 
of relief.
For how last 
week felt on Monday afternoon, 
when news of Zavier Simpson’s 
suspension came down and the 
Wolverines were suddenly staring 
down a must-win game at a listless 
Nebraska without two of their best 
players, they couldn’t have hoped 
for a better outcome. 
Michigan survived in Lincoln, 
stringing together minutes from 
walk-on C.J. Baird and sophomore 
wing Adrien Nunez, getting by 
when a loss would have put a seri-
ous dent in its NCAA Tournament 
hopes. With Simpson back Saturday 
against Rutgers, Michigan again 
scraped by, behind a 20-point per-
formance from Brandon Johns Jr., 
some pick-and-roll mastery from 
Simpson and by making the late free 
throws it missed against Illinois. 
It put the seven days prior in a new 
light, because it’s easier to press on 
the gas when the speed bumps are 
in the rearview mirror.
Simpson’s suspension now looks 
more like a speed bump than any-
thing lasting. On Saturday, Johns 
looked like someone at the develop-
mental endpoint of getting tossed 
into the fire. Michigan shot 9-of-19 
from 3-point range and got produc-
tion from all five of its starters. If 
the Wolverines are going to survive 
the next month, it will look some-
thing like that.

Afterward, conversation focused 
on Simpson’s return and Johns’ 
breakout. The bigger picture — 
Michigan finally starting to get out 
of a hole it spent most of January 
digging — wasn’t mentioned. But its 
shadow draped across everything.
“Brandon’s been playing great 
for us all year,” Howard said. “A lot 
of the things that he’s been doing 
for his team to help us win is things 
that doesn’t really show up in the 
box score.
“So what happened today is, he 
got off to a great start. Finished 
with 20 points, but the points is 
not where it shows up. It’s effort, 

it’s attention to detail, being able, 
defensively, to guard ‘1’ through 
‘4.’ Being able to rim protect at the 
basket.”
Howard has spent much of the 
year insisting that Johns does more 
than his statistical output. Saturday 
— when Johns scored double digits 
for the second consecutive game, 
looked confident with the ball in his 
hands and played a central role in 
Michigan’s best win this year — was 
the first time that felt evident to the 
plain eye.
If one good thing could come out 
of Isaiah Livers’ extended absence, 
it would be Johns playing like this.
“I’m just so, so proud of Bran-
don,” Simpson said. “He’s a guy 
who’s been through a lot since his 
freshman season. Come in this sea-
son with a new coach, new offense 
and a lot of different things but 

he managed to keep his head up. 
He’s worked hard every single day 
in practice, he gives it his all, he’s 
locked in. Before the game, he’s 
sitting down with coach Howard, 
watching film. It’s the small things 
like that I feel like come into play. I 
felt like his hard work is definitely 
paying off.”
A few minutes afterward, Simp-
son was cordoned off by a spokes-
person in a room behind the tunnel 
leading to the court, answering 
questions about his suspension 
for the first time. He didn’t go into 
much detail but spoke with a lead-
er’s voice.
“Yes, I spoke with my team-
mates,” he said at one point. “That’s 
what a captain should do, right?”
His leadership is as defining to 
this Michigan team as anything 
else. Reacting to the last week of 
events in the right way — the way he 
did Saturday, a way that makes his 
teammates have his back the way he 
said they did — is vital. 
This iteration of the Wolverines is 
not as talented as last year’s, which 
spent half of the season blowing 
teams out of the water. It isn’t mold-
ing an identity made for March, 
like two years ago, when Simpson’s 
persona melded into focus over the 
course of Big Ten play. Right now, 
it’s doing just enough to survive in 
a stacked Big Ten, to bridge the gap 
between the last year of the John 
Beilein era and the first recruiting 
class of the Juwan Howard era.
If Michigan gets over that gap 
with an NCAA Tournament appear-
ance (or with any success in the 
tournament itself), it’ll be thanks to 
Simpson’s leadership, to a potential 
Johns breakout and to games like 
Saturday’s.
It won’t be pretty or loud — that’s 
not the style of this group. It’ll scrap 
and claw, and in the end, it’ll do just 
enough.
If nothing else, the past week 
proved that.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
The Michigan basketball team notched a Quadrant 1 win on Saturday, beating Rutgers, 69-63, at Madison Square Garden.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
Senior guard Zavier Simpson returned from a one-game suspension on Saturday against Rutgers, scoring nine points with 10 assists.

Simpson 
returns 
with 10 

NEW YORK — Zavier Simpson was 
back, doing Zavier Simpson things. 
When Jon Teske set a screen for the 
senior point guard on the left wing, 
Rutgers big man Miles Johnson hedged 
a little too hard. Simpson was one step 
ahead, evading the attempted hindrance 
with relative ease before delivering a 
bounce pass to Teske rolling along the 
baseline. 
Without a Scarlet Knight in his vicinity, 
the senior center rocked the rim to extend 
Michigan’s lead to 12 points midway 
through the second half of its 69-63 win 
over No. 25 Rutgers at Madison Square 
Garden. 
The game marked Simpson’s return to 
action following a suspension for violating 
team policy. He served that suspension 
Tuesday, when the Wolverines played — 
and beat — Nebraska away from home. On 
Friday afternoon, the program sent a press 
release announcing Simpson would play 
Saturday. Asked about the circumstances 
surrounding the suspension and his 
reinstatement, Simpson declined to give 
details.
“At the end of the day, you learn from 
your lessons because you gotta move 
forward,” Simpson said. “It’s not about 
what happens, it’s about how you react 
from it. Just gotta reflect on things, move 
forward and try to get out here and get a 
dub, which we did.”
In his return, Simpson looked like his 
usual self. Despite only scoring nine points 
on 1-of-5 shooting, Simpson proved once 
again to be the straw that stirs Michigan’s 
drink. He finished with ten assists — the 
Scarlet Knights had six assists total — four 
rebounds and three steals against scrappy 
defenders like Jacob Young and Montez 
Mathis. 
Whether it was a pinpoint pass to Teske 
in the paint or a drive and dish to freshman 
forward Franz Wagner on the perimeter, 
Simpson got his teammates involved all 
afternoon. 
“I wanted to come out here, make 
smart plays, play as hard as I can and play 
as smart as I can,” Simpson said. “At the 
end of the day, I just want to give it all to 
my teammates, making sure I’m working 
hard and finding them. Rutgers had a great 
defense so the key was finding the open 
man.”

Along with his 10 assists though, 
Simpson committed six turnovers. In the 
second half alone, he had five — giving the 
Scarlet Knights a route back into the game. 
He would ultimately redeem himself. 
With Michigan harboring a narrow 
advantage down the stretch and his 
teammates getting sped up offensively in 
the back and forth action, Simpson slowed 
things down, making sure the Wolverines 
got the best look possible. 
Down by three, with 24 seconds 
remaining, Rutgers fouled Simpson off 
the inbounds play. Amidst chants and 
taunts raining down on him from the 
Scarlet Knights’ faithful and the pressure 
of closing out the game resting squarely 
on his shoulders, Simpson sank both 
from the foul line to give Michigan a five-
point edge. A possession later, following 
a pull-up three from Rutgers’ Geo Baker, 
Simpson was hacked again. Though he 
missed the back end of the one-and-one, 
restoring a three-point advantage proved 
crucial in holding off the Scarlet Knights. 
“It was great that our guys stepped up 
there and knocked down some shots we 
needed to knock down,” Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard said. “It was mental 
stability on all levels. When teams are 
making runs, staying poised, and then 
keeping that mental stability we all talk 
about as a group.”
Added Simpson: “When I go to the 
free-throw line, I just try to stay locked 
in. At the end of the day, it’s just like Kobe 
(Bryant) said, ‘Next shot, next free throw, 
next play’ — whatever it is. When I go to 
the free-throw line I just try to think about 
Kawhi Leonard. When he goes to the free-
throw line he just looks so focused and 
doesn’t let anything bother him. So I just 
try to have a Kawhi Leonard mentality.”
Simpson’s performance was far from 
spectacular, but it got the job done and 
it signified a return to normalcy for a 
Michigan team desperate for consistency. 
Regardless of the stage and the 
circumstances, Simpson seems to always 
give them that.

How Beecher and Van Wyhe’s ejections changed the game in ‘M’ loss

Johnny Beecher had a foot 
off the ice and into the tunnel 
leading to the locker room.
The freshman forward had 
just been thrown out of the game 
for headbutting another player 
in a scuffle. When he got fully off 
the ice, he turned to the referee 
right as the he was closing the 
door behind him and launched 
into his tirade.
What he shouted couldn’t 
be heard floors above the ice, 
or even rows away from his 
tantrum. But the nearest fans 
inches to him caught one word 
— “bullshit,” they recalled him 
saying.
And then, as he stormed 
through the tunnel and out of 
sight, a sound no one could miss 
rang around Yost Ice Arena. A 
crack of a stick, being slammed 
against something hard. He was 
angry, and he wanted everyone 
to know.
And there was a reason for 
it. It was a close game, and 
his absence would make a 
difference. He is currently tied 
for third on the team for point 
total with 12 and takes part in all 
phases of the game: power play, 
penalty kill and even strength. 
He manned Michigan’s most 
productive 
line 
pointwise, 
which included senior forward 
and captain Will Lockwood. 
And instead of being on 
the ice, he was in the locker 
room — sitting and waiting for 
the remainder of the game to 
unravel.
Afterwords, as the rest of the 
team trickled in after a tiring 4-1 
loss to the Buckeyes, he came 
up to Lockwood and tried to 
apologize. But Lockwood shut 
him down quickly.
“I said, ‘There’s no reason to 
apologize, emotions get the best 
of you,’ ” Lockwood explained. 
“He was just coming in, trying 
to defend me. 
“As a linemate, that’s all you 
can ask from a guy, so there’s no 

apology needed there.”
The comforting came from 
heart; Lockwood knew all too 
well the sinking feeling of a 
costly ejection against Ohio 
State. He had done the same just 
last year — he let Beecher know 
that 
too. 
But 
the 
difference 
there was that 
Lockwood 
was 
thrown 
out 
in 
the midst of a 
double-overtime 
period, 
which 
concluded 
shortly 
afterwards.
Beecher’s 
ejection 
came 
just over two minutes into the 
second period, leaving a lot of 
the game left to be played short 
staffed. And that problem was 
only magnified after Michael 
Pastujov obtained an upper 

body injury midway through the 
second period.
But the final nail in the coffin 
came with four minutes left in 
the second period. Sophomore 
forward 
Garrett 
Van 
Wyhe 
collided against an Ohio State 
skater 
and 
raised his two 
balled-up 
fists 
to the skater’s 
helmet. 
He, 
subsequently, 
was thrown out 
as well.
“We 
lost 
three forwards,” 
Michigan coach 
Mel 
Pearson 
said. 
“So 
we 
were down to 10 forwards in the 
game, and those guys had a lot of 
ice time.”
The effects of the ejections 
couldn’t be seen right away. 
In fact, following Beecher’s 

ejection, the Wolverines killed 
off the Buckeyes’ man-advantage 
and scored a goal of their own to 
make it 2-1.
But when Van Wyhe was 
called for a game misconduct, 
cracks in Michigan’s forward 
depth 
started 
to 
show. 
The 
Wolverines were 
already 
forced 
to kill off ten 
minutes 
worth 
of 
penalties 
from 
those 
ejections, but to 
make 
matters 
worse, arguably 
Michigan’s best 
penalty 
killer 
in Van Wyhe was scaling the 
stairs to the locker room, as the 
Wolverines were forced to fend 
off another five-minute man-
disadvantage.
The irony of it all is that the 

fact that Michigan could only 
send four players to the ice 
during that time might have 
prevented an earlier collapse. 
But the collapse did come.
Each line plays a shift that 
usually lasts one or two minutes. 
Once 
that 
threshold 
hits 
they 
take 
the 
next opening for 
a line change. 
But 
after 
killing two five-
minute 
majors 
where 
each 
unit had two or 
more 
minutes 
of 
ice 
time, 
the 
forwards 
started to get run to the ground. 
Production aside, that’s where 
losing Beecher and Van Wyhe 
hurt the most. The makeshift 
lines started to see overlap, 
where a few of the skaters had 

back-to-back shifts or would 
go back out with little rest in 
between. 
But there really was no other 
choice. There were only 10 
forwards.
And halfway through the 
third period, Pearson started to 
recognize the fatigue. The extra 
shifts began taking their toll.
“I thought we had some good 
push there,” Pearson said. “And 
then about halfway through, we 
just hit the wall.
“And then when they scored, 
it just, it’s like letting the air out 
of the balloon.”
It was the final period in the 
second night of a back-to-back, 
and the exhaustion was starting 
to show, even if the players didn’t 
notice. Adrenaline was keeping 
them 
going, 
physically 
and 
mentally. But Pearson noticed, 
as did the Buckeyes, who took 
advantage of the fatigue to 
widen the gap.
It wasn’t solely exhaustion 
that crashed the parade, either. 
Line combinations also played a 
part.
“Centers kinda hold the line 
together,” Lockwood said.
And the Wolverines had lost 
two of their best.
So Pearson had to piece 
together 
provisional 
lines, 
putting at least two forwards 
who 
have 
skated 
together 
before on a line and hoped the 
chemistry and fit was there.
“You just went on a hunch,” 
Pearson said. “Just trying to 
create some good defense but at 
the same time, some guys who 
can work together and create 
some opportunities.”
The lines that were put out 
did create chances, outshooting 
Ohio State 11-7 in the third 
period. But the challenge of 
being under-manned was too 
much to overcome. There was no 
next man up, with two men out. 
“It’s 
physical,” 
Pearson 
said. “It was draining on those 
players.”
And that’s just how ejections 
go.

Michigan splits series after 4-1 loss

When the second period 
started, the game was still 
within Michigan’s reach.
It was trailing No. 11 Ohio 
State by two goals, but this 
wasn’t unchartered territory. 
The 
Wolverines 
had 
found 
themselves in positions like 
this all season, and lately it 
seemed they’d finally learned 
how to overcome adversities 
thrown at them.
This 
time, 
however, 
the 
Wolverines couldn’t recover 
from 
a 
two-goal 
deficit 
and 
mental 
and 
emotional 
mistakes. It was all too much 
for Michigan (11-12-3 overall, 
6-8-2-1 Big Ten) to overcome as 
it fell, 4-1, to the Buckeyes (16-
9-3, 9-7-2-0).
Saturday night, the first of 
those adversities came just 43 
seconds after the game started.
The sequence started when 
freshman 
forward 
Johnny 
Beecher lost the faceoff. From 
there, the puck slid back to the 
blueline and met the stick of a 
Buckeye defender. He passed 
it to teammate Matt Miller 
who didn’t hesitate to shoot at 
sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann.
But Mann — the player that’s 
consistently bailed his team out 
all season long — didn’t stop it. 
The puck went right past him. 
Before Michigan could even 
settle into the game, it was 
already playing from behind. 
“It’s tough letting in a goal 
in the first or last minute of the 
period,” senior forward Nick 
Pastujov said. “On the bench, 
it’s just kind of something 
where you gotta have short-
term memory loss. Reset and 
know that … we are outplaying 
playing them. We can be a 
better team, and we just gotta 
keep that rolling.”
Eventually, the Wolverines 
found an answer for Miller’s 
goal. Their response was too 
late though. It came midway 
through the second period 
when 
junior 
forward 
Jack 
Becker used his body to redirect 
a shot from sophomore Jimmy 
Lambert.

Becker’s goal made the game 
2-1, his team having fallen 
behind by two goals in the first 
period. Nine minutes after 
Miller’s goal, teammate Jaedon 
Leslie beat Mann between his 
pads.
Michigan’s lone goal of the 
game came at what could’ve 
been a turning point. Seven 
minutes before cutting the 
Buckeyes’ lead, the Wolverines 
lost 
a 
forward. 
Freshman 
Johnny Beecher was ejected 
from the game for head-butting.
As the game progressed, 
Becker’s spark never became 
anything more than that. Just 
under fourteen minutes after 
Beecher was tossed from the 
game, 
sophomore 
forward 
Garrett Van Wyhe received a 
game misconduct for charging.
Down 
two 
centers, 
Michigan’s 
chances 
at 
a 
comeback slipped further out 
of reach. The bench got even 
shorter when junior forward 
Michael Pastujov didn’t return 
to play after suffering an upper 
body injury.
“It’s tough,” senior forward 
Will Lockwood said. “Guys 
gotta step up. Centers kind of 
hold the line together. They’re 
taking 
draws 
and 
(have) 
responsibility in the d-zone.”
When 
the 
third 
period 
started, the true effects of these 
adversities 
hadn’t 
revealed 
themselves 
yet. 
Wolverine 
forwards were being double 
shifted. Their adrenaline, and 
Ohio State’s one goal lead, 
fueled them.
Halfway through the third, 
Michigan’s 
tiredness 
was 

obvious. And when a team 
is tired, it makes mistakes. 
Saturday night, these mistakes 
resulted in the Wolverines’ 
comeback hopes crumpling.
In 
the 
offensive 
zone, 
sophomore defenseman Jack 
Summers skated with the puck. 
He was pressured by Buckeye 
defender Quinn Preston, who 
poke checked Summers. Then, 
Preston took off on a two-on-
one with freshman Keaton 
Pehrson as Michigan’s lone 
man back. Preston slid the puck 
to Austin Pooley, and he tucked 
it between the two pads of 
Mann.
“Just a bad mistake and 
turnover,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “It ends up in our 
net. We just couldn’t get that 
save or bounce that we needed.”
Again, the Wolverines trailed 
by two, but now, time was 
running out for a comeback. In 
a last ditch attempt to give his 
team a boost, Pearson pulled 
Mann and added an extra 
attacker. Nothing good came 
from it.
With 
fifty 
seconds 
remaining, Preston shot the 
puck into Michigan’s empty 
net and sealed the fate of the 
game. A game that at one point 
was 
completely 
within 
the 
Wolverines’ reach had slipped 
so far away. They made too 
many mistakes — some driven 
by emotions and some by fatigue 
— and Ohio State capitalized on 
all of them.
“We beat ourselves, that’s 
the most disappointing thing,” 
Pearson said. “ … (We played) 
undisciplined.”

Fall ball gives Wolverines No. 17 rank

Take the highs with the 
lows.
It’s something the Michigan 
softball team has come to 
live by. With a rocky start to 
last season and an early loss 
in the Regional round of last 
season’s NCAA Tournament, 
the Wolverines are not without 
their rollercoaster moments.
Before Michigan’s fall break 
trip to Cuba and ax-throwing 
outing was its short stint in fall-
ball. Without their annual trip 
to the Traverse City College 
Tournament in September, the 
Wolverines only played in two 
fall series.
The 
first 
was 
against 
Kentucky, 
who 
Michigan 
most recently played in 2017, 
when the Wildcats swept the 
Wolverines over three games 
at Alumni Field.
This fall, in an offensive 
struggle, Michigan’s younger 
talent 
failed 
to 
capitalize 
on its opportunities. With 
a combined six runs over 
three games, the gap in its 
line-up was evident after the 
graduation of six seniors last 
season. 
“I think we struggled a 
little bit to just find out bats, 
find out (who was) pitching, 
you know just find ourselves 
as a team,” junior left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien said. “We 
graduated a lot of people and 
starting the year together, I 
think we learned a lot from 
those games.”
In their annual matchup 
with 
Michigan 
State, 
the 
Wolverines’ young line-up was 
also exposed. Going 1-1 on the 
weekend, Michigan couldn’t 
generate the power necessary 
to get over the hump.
“Those were the things the 
team needed in order to grow,” 
senior 
infielder 
Madison 
Uden said. “We needed those 
experiences in the fall, we 
needed 
those 
rollercoaster 
moments. And although the 
games didn’t turn out the way 
we wanted them to, the team 
as a whole is developed where 
we need them to be right now, 

ready for the season.”
But through it all, Michigan 
is unconcerned with its fall 
performance. Since fall-ball 
games don’t yield meaningful 
stats, 
the 
rollercoaster 
moments 
the 
Wolverines 
faced this fall left the coaches 
with 
perhaps 
something 
more important 
— a benchmark 
showing 
places 
for 
improvement.
“Fall ball is 
meaningless,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins said. 
“As 
a 
coach, 
you can set your compass, and 
you can gauge what you need 
to get better at. And my book 
was full, so we’re still working 
through those pages. There’s 
a lot to get better at for our 
team.”
Another 
benchmark 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
looking 
to 
improve upon is their USA 
Today preseason ranking — 
No. 17.
“I think it’s motivational,” 
Uden said. “I think it’s not 
where the seniors want to 
be, it’s not where Michigan 
softball wants to be, and 
there’s a higher standard to 
that ranking and so I think 
that it’s a little bit hard on the 
tongue. I think that we have a 
lot to prove this year.”
Added 
Beaubien: 
“The 
standard for this program is to 

be in Oklahoma City and it is to 
be a national contender. We’re 
definitely aware that that’s not 
where we’ve been the past few 
years. We don’t think that’s 
acceptable.”
Despite their No. 17 ranking 
and 
less 
than 
stellar 
fall 
performance, 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
unconcerned. 
Michigan 
is 
looking forward, 
not 
back. 
It’s 
using 
the 
rollercoaster 
moments 
from 
the fall to propel 
it.
“We’re 
all 
on one heartbeat, one page,” 
sophomore right-hander Alex 
Storako said. “We’re all really 
connected with each other, 
I don’t really think rankings 
mean anything as much as 
others’opinions, so I think just 
once we’re all on the same page 
and one heartbeat it’s really 
kind of what makes the best 
part of the chemistry.”
Michigan 
will 
have 
the 
chance to prove itself and 
dispel the No. 17 ranking, 
as it plays multiple ranked 
opponents 
in 
the 
non-
conference 
season. 
These 
include No. 1 Washington, No. 
4 UCLA, No. 6 Texas and No. 
7 Florida.
Michigan’s response to the 
highs and the lows of that 
gauntlet could determine the 
rest of their season.

MICHIGAN BEATS IOWA, 78-63, BEHIND 
HILLMON’S 30 POINTS

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Dominick Sokotoff / Daily

HOUSE OF NAZ

Design by Jack Silberman

Hillmon’s 30 points lead Wolverines

It’s tough to find anything 
about sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon that hasn’t already 
been said. 
Her teammates love her. 
Her 
coaches 
rave 
about 
her. Opposing coaches have 
nightmares about her. All of 
them have plenty to say. 
And yet, she created even 
more to talk about on Sunday 
at Crisler Center. In Michigan’s 
78-63 
win 
over 
Iowa, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
most 
consistent 
player one-upped herself again, 
scoring 30 points on 14-for-
19 shooting. She added 10 
rebounds to secure her seventh 
double-double of the season. 
Even though fans have grown 
accustomed 
to 
seeing 
her 
dominate, Hillmon continues to 
find new ways to impress.
“To me, nobody has figured 
out 
how 
to 
defend 
her,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “I don’t know if she’s 
defendable. … She affects the 
game in many ways, she gets 
offensive rebounds when we 
need offensive rebounds, she 
gets defensive stops when we 
need a big defensive stop.”
Early on Sunday, it was just 
Naz being Naz. She opened up 
scoring with a driving layup. On 
the next possession, she scored 
again in the post. She didn’t 
need to do much else in the first 
quarter, when her teammates 
shot 7-for-10 from the field. 
But in the second quarter, 
the Wolverines went cold. A 
team that couldn’t miss early 
on started the quarter 2-for-9, 

allowing the Hawkeyes to pull 
within six. Midway through 
the quarter, Michigan had gone 
nearly three minutes without a 
field goal. 
Hillmon ended the drought 
rather 
emphatically. 
After 
senior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson’s 3-pointer doinked off 
the rim, Hillmon pushed past 
an Iowa defender, grabbed the 
offensive rebound and sank the 

layup. She would score eight 
of the Wolverines’ 15 points 
that quarter. 
“Their bigs worked very 
hard to try to get around 
me, sit behind me so I don’t 
turn,” Hillmon said. “They 
switched up their defense 
a lot, so I had to be very 
physical, try to get them as 
close to under the basket as 
I could because I know that 
they would have help or 
they have really good post 
defensive players.”

That 
physicality 
never 
wavered. As the game wore on, 
Hillmon continued to bully the 
Hawkeyes’ defenders, working 
inside for post buckets and five 
offensive rebounds. 
Those numbers were even 
more crucial with Michigan’s 
other 
bigs 
in 
foul 
trouble. 
Junior forward Hailey Brown, 
who starts alongside Hillmon, 
picked up her third foul late in 
the second quarter. Early in the 
third, freshman center Izabel 
Varejão — normally the first big 
off the bench — picked up her 
fourth foul, putting even more 
pressure on Hillmon. 
In the end, it didn’t matter. 
Hillmon has shown what she’s 
capable of multiple times this 
season, and on Sunday, she 
demonstrated what it looks like 
when she’s at her best. 
“I think one of the greatest 
things about Naz is that she’s an 
incredible teammate and she’s 
really, truly unselfish,” Barnes 
Arico said. “So she’s having a 
hard time adjusting to this role of, 
‘Coach wants me to take 19 shots 
a game, that’s kind of out of my 
comfort zone.’ … (She’s) probably 
one of the greatest players — 
talents — that I’ve coached, but 
even a better teammate.”
So far this season, it’s been 
tough to find anyone who can 
truly match up with Hillmon 
when she gets going. She rolls 
over everyone that tries to 
guard her, and she never seems 
to run out of gas, punctuated by 
her 39 minutes played Sunday.
Based on her performance 
against Iowa, it looks like she 
can keep that up, even against 
the Big Ten’s best teams.

Michigan holds off Iowa, wins 78-63

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
was 
in 
a 
dangerous spot.
After the Wolverines (14-7 
overall, 5-5 Big Ten) shot 75 
percent from the floor in the 
first quarter and led by as much 
as 12, poor second quarter 
shooting allowed No. 18 Iowa 
(18-4, 9-2) to cut the lead to six 
with five minutes left in the 
first half. Sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon was the only 
Michigan player to make a shot 
in the quarter — scoring all six 
of the team’s second quarter 
points to that point.
With just under four minutes 
left in the half, freshman 
guard Michelle Sidor checked 
in. Sidor hadn’t scored since a 
Jan. 12 loss to Maryland and 
had 
played 
sparingly 
since 
then. But on her first offensive 
possession, 
junior 
forward 
Hailey Brown faced a double 
team in the paint and kicked 
it out to Sidor, who drained an 
open 3-pointer.
Two possessions later, she 
made another one, and the 
Wolverines’ lead was back up 
to 13. They took a 12-point lead 
into halftime, en route to a 
78-63 victory.
“Michelle Sidor comes in and 
makes two big threes for us, 
that just changed the landscape 
of how they were able to defend 
us and opened up the floor 
for us,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “(She) might 
not have a ton of numbers in the 
box score, but I thought (her) 
play was really, really special.”

Following 
an 
under-.500 
month of January and the 
loss of second-leading scorer 
Kayla Robbins, the Wolverines’ 
NCAA 
Tournament 
hopes 
were in question. Picking up 
their first win against a ranked 
opponent is a huge boon to their 
tournament chances.
Michigan took its momentum 
from the first half into the 
third quarter and got off to a 
fast start. With 6:43 left in the 
quarter, following an 11-5 run 
highlighted by four of Hillmon’s 
30 points, the Wolverines led 
the Hawkeyes by 18.
But a minute later, freshman 
center Izabel Varejão picked up 
her fourth foul and had to sit. 
With Brown also on the bench 
deep in foul trouble, Michigan 
had to turn to sophomore 
forward Emily Kiser for an 
extended period of time. With 
Kiser in, Iowa looked to feed its 
bigs and expose her. Over a 1:30 
stretch, the Hawkeyes went on 
an 8-0 run, cutting the lead to 
11 and forcing Barnes Arico to 
call a timeout.
The timeout settled down the 
Wolverines. Coming out of it, 
they went on a 7-0 run of their 
own, with six points coming 
from 
Hillmon. 
Michigan 
averted disaster. 
Despite 
a 
five-minute 
stretch without a point and 
the Hawkeyes shooting 58.8 
percent in the fourth quarter, 
the Wolverines survived.
“We knew they were going 
to make some runs, as they did 
in the third quarter,” Barnes 
Arico said. “But we were able 
to sustain those runs and make 
big plays down the stretch and 

go into someone like Naz and 
make them have to defend her 
down the stretch.”
Score-wise, the Wolverines 
could afford to go through a 
few scoring droughts due to 
an efficient first quarter. After 
Thursday’s loss to Northwestern 
in which Michigan committed 
eight first-quarter turnovers, it 
emphasized coming out strong. 
The Wolverines still had their 
fair share of turnovers, though 
— six total in the first quarter 
— but they played good defense 
and knocked down shots.
Michigan jumped out to a 
quick 6-0 lead, and Iowa didn’t 
score for the first three minutes 
of the game. The Hawkeyes 
stopped 
the 
bleeding 
with 
3-pointers on each of their next 
two possessions, but couldn’t 
gain much momentum as the 
Wolverines 
prevented 
Iowa 
from getting shots in the paint 
and forcing it to settle for 
3-pointers. The Hawkeyes shot 
60 percent from deep in the 
quarter, but made just 4-of-
11 shots from the floor, while 
Michigan made 9-of-12.
“Obviously, 
an 
opposing 
team and you’re down in the 
first quarter, you’re gonna get 
a little deflated,” sophomore 
guard Amy Dilk said. “We 
just emphasized to just keep 
pushing, because they’re the 
type of team — anyone in the 
Big Ten — the game is not over.”
While Iowa wouldn’t relent 
until the very end, a fast start 
and baskets at key times to 
stop the Hawkeyes’ momentum 
propelled the Wolverines to 
their first win over a ranked 
opponent.

I think one of 
the greatest 
things about 
Naz is that she’s 
an incredible 
teammate and 
she’s really, 
truly unselfish.
