With Obama, increased security
delays graduation start one hour

Family, colleagues
remember 'absolute
giant' in the field of
political science
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Samuel Eldersveld, legendary
professor emeritus of political sci-
ence and a former mayor of Ann
Arbor, died at his home on Friday
at thce age of 92.
Eldersveld taught at his alma
mater for more than five decades
and as mayor of Ann Arbor worked
to provide equal rights for all the
city's citizens. Throughout his aca-
demic career, Eldersveld also trav-
eled to many countries throughout
the world to further his studies and
research about political parties, in
addition to writing 22 books and
countless articles. As Political Sci-
ence Prof. Hanes Walton, Jr. put it,
Eldersveld was an "absolute giant
in the field (of political science)."
Eldersveld was born in 1919 in
Kalamazoo, Mich. and grew up
in Muskegon, Mich., where his
father was a minister. He earned
his bachelor's degree from Calvin
College in 1938 and received both
his master's degree and Ph.D. from

Daily News Editor
In an e-mail to be sent to
graduating seniors this morning,
University officials are expected

to announce the time for this
Spring's commencement ceremo-
ny will be delayed by one hour
from it's original start time.
The decision to delay com-
mencement - originally sched-
uled to begin at 10 a.m. - until 11
a.m. was the result of discussions
about the additional security that
will be required when President
Barack Obama is on site to deliver
the commencement address.
The decision was made to
ensure that all in attendance will

have enough time to clear security
and make it to their seats, accord-
ing to a statement from University
President Mary Su~e Coleman in a
press release that is expected to
be distributed later this morning.
"We want students and their
guests to have plenty of time
to comfortably make it to cam-
pus and through security at the
stadium, so that they can enjoy
this historic event honoring the
achievements of our 2010 gradu-
ates," Coleman is quoted as say-

ng.
White House officials and
event planners on campus coordi-
nated the announcement, accord-
ing to University officials.
Obama, who will be the third
sitting president to deliver the
University's commencement
address, is the first president to
visit the University since height-
ened security measures were
implemented at public venues like
Michigan Stadium after the Sept.

the University of Michigan in 1939
and 1946, respectively.
After earning his master's
degree, Eldersveld joined the U.S.
Navy as a lieutenant, serving as
a communications officer in the
Philippines during World War I.
After the war, he returned to the
University where he finished his
doctorate and later joined the fac-
ulty.
Eldersveld was elected mayor
of Ann Arbor in 1957, running as a
Democratic candidate, which was
quite a feat at the time, when Ann

MSAwebsite $6,000 over budget

MSA President
Mahanti says failed
site is his fault
By ELYANA TWIGGS
DailyStaffReporter
At last night's Michigan Student
Assembly meeting, MSA President
Abhishek Mahanti, apologized
for the costly and unsuccessful
attempt he led to fix MSA's website
this past year.

According to an e-mail sent to
MSA representatives, MSA Stu-
dent General Counsel Jim Brus-
star wrote that
MSA spent close NOTEBOOK
to $9,000 to hire
graphic and web designers to fix
MSA's website.
The cost, Brusstar wrote in the
e-mail, was an "egregious mis-
take."
MSA treasurer Vishal Bajaj said
the money to fund this website
renovation - which was estimated
to cost $3,000 - came out of MSA

payroll funds.
Mahanti said that the cost to fix
the website is on his shoulders.
"I take full responsibility for it,"
Mahanti said at the meeting last
night. "I have done a large disser-
vice to the students. I am whole-
heartedly putting my effort into
getting it fixed."
As head of the project, Mahanti
hired two University student web
designers to launch a new MSA
website in the fall and the develop-
ers worked on the project for eight

By DEVON THORSBY

One of the defendants charged
with setting fire to the former loca-
tion of Pinball Pete's on South Uni-
versity Avenue was convicted last
week after pleading guilty to arson
of real property.
In front of Washtenaw County

Judge Melinda Morris, tan MacK-
enzie pled guiltyrto one of the three
original counts - arson of real
property valued at over $20,000.
Prosecutors dismissed the count
of preparation to burn property
at the hearing and also dismissed
the count of arson of personal
property valued at over $20,000 in
December.
MacKenzie turned himself in
to Ann Arbor police weeks after
setting fire to the vacant building
on South University Avenue on
Oct. 24, 2009. The fire devastat-
ed the building and caused minor
damages to both the University
Towers apartment complex and

Momo Tea.
MacKenzie's lawyer, Patrick
Carmody, said in an interview that
the sentencingis tentativelysched-
uled for March 29, though Morris
has granted a possible delay at the
request of the defense.
MacKenzie is asking the .court
to grant him Holmes Youthful
Trainee Act status, which would
erase his criminal record once the
sentence is served. -
According to Carmody, Mor-

Mich. child welfare
agency receives
mixed report card
Michigan's child-welfare agency,
which agreed to improve foster
care and other services for kids, has
made significant progress in some
areas but its overall performance
slipped, according to a new report
released yesterday by a court-
appointed monitor.
Kevin Ryan said Michigan needs
more foster parents and that too
many children don't have perma-
nent families.
"It's still relatively early in the
reform process," Ryan told a fed-
eral judge. "Reform on this scale
takes time."
In 2008, the state settled a law-
suit filed on behalf of nearly 20,000
children by a New York group
called Children's Rights. Michigan
agreed to many changes, including
hundreds of new hires to reduce the
caseloads of workers who oversee
children in foster care or in protec-
tive services.
WASHINGTON
First lady to deliver
3 commencement
addresses this year
First lady Michelle Obama will
be the featured graduation speaker
at three commencement ceremo-
nies this spring.
* Mrs. Obama will speak to gradu-
ates at the University of Arkansas
at Pine Bluff on May 8. The White
House says the university was the
only state-supported institution
of higher education for African-
Americans when it opened more
than 130 years ago.
On June 11, the first lady will
address graduates at Anacostia
Senior High School, a Washington,
D.C. public school Mrs. Obama vis-
ited last year as part of her mentor-
ing program for young women.
And if students at The George
Washington University complete
100,000 hours of community ser-
vice before their May 16 gradu-
ation, Mrs. Obama will speak at
that commencement as well. The
first lady issued the service chal-
lenge to the student body at the
beginning of the school year.
SANTIAGO, CHILE
* Earthquake causes
delayed school year
Chile's earthquake-delayed school
year began Monday, but education
officials said it may take until April 1
* before all students are back in class-
rooms.
About half of the schools in the
disaster zone have some damage
from the 8.8-magnitude earthquake
and tsunami, and others are being
used as staging areas for relief.
While the education ministry hasn't
tallied the total repair cost, it will
likely use up a large part of the $1.2
billion that Chile estimates it will
need for restoring infrastructure.
The earthquake hit on the last
weekend ofthe South American sum-

mer vacation, and many families had
just made back-to-school purchases
of books and uniforms, only to see the
supplies ruined or swept away.
TOKYO
Japan confirms
Cold War "secret"
pacts with U.S.
Japan confirmed yesterday
secret Cold War-era pacts with
Washington that tacitly allowed
nuclear warships in Japanese ports
in violation of a hallowed postwar
principle, effectively acknowledg-
ing that previous governments had
lied about them for decades.
While the move was welcomed
as a step toward greater govern-
ment transparency, atomic bomb
survivors expressed disgust that
officials kept such agreements hid-
den for dozens of years.
The revelations came after an
investigation by a panel of experts
appointed by Prime Minister Yukio
Hatoyama's government, which
swept to power last fall on prom-
ises to bring more openness to
government. His left-leaning party
defeated the long-ruling conserva-
tives who repeatedly denied the
existence of such agreements.
The findings themselves aren't
much of a shock because declassi-
fied U.S. documents have already
confirmed such 1960s agreements,
and a few former Japanese bureau-
crats have spoken out about them in
recent years.

Obama says he
will root out
health care fraud

Announcement
comes as part of
president's push for
health care reform
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama said yes-
terday he'll bring in high-tech
bounty hunters to help root out
health care fraud, grabbing a
populist idea with bipartisan
backing in his final push to over-
haul the system.
The White House announce-
ment came as Obama prepared
to travel to Missouri today, tak-
ing his closing argument to the
nation's heartland. The trip will
be his second public appearance
this week to rally support and fire
up nervous Democrats.
The White House released
details of the anti-fraud plan
hours after a fresh challenge to the
administration from major busi-
ness groups that unveiled a multi-
million-dollaradcampaignarguing
that under Obama's plan "health
care costs will go even higher, mak-
ing a bad economyworse."
The ad buy, costing between
$4 million and $10 million, will
start today on national cable
TV outlets. Later in the week,
the campaign shifts to 17 states
home to moderate and conserva-
tive Democrats. Their votes are
critical to Obama's endgame for
ELDERSVELD
From Page 1A
the city's first Democratic mayor
since 1929 - defeating an incum-
bent who had held the position for
the 12 years prior to his election.
Lucy Murphy, Eldersveld's
daughter, said her father ran for
mayor of Ann Arbor - much to
her mother's chagrin - because
nobody else in the Democratic
Party expressed interest in the
position. Murphy said her father
convinced her mother to let him
run because he said he had no
chance of winning.
"He and a small group of peo-
ple, who were trying to revital-
ize the Democratic Party in Ann
Arbor, were trying to getsomeone
to run for mayor," Murphy said.
"Nobody wanted to run for mayor
because they all knew they would
lose. He was twisting arms and
finally someone said, 'Well, what
about you? You keep asking peo-
ple to run for mayor. Why don't
you run?'"
Though he was busy at City
Hall, Eldersveld continued to
teach at the University while he
was mayor.
According to University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald,
Eldersveld would ride his bicycle
to City Hall at 7 a.m. every morn-
ing. Then he would return to
campus to teach his political sci-
ence classes at 10 a.m. After class
let out, he would ride back to City
Hall to complete his work and
attend various meetings during
the evening.
Murphy - a professor of histo-
ry at Ohio State University - said
Eldersveld repeatedly demon-
strated that kind of dedication.
"Even though the mayor's job
was considered a part-time job, he
did everything," she said. "That

was typical of Dad. He would do
so much. He didn't feel like he
was limited. So, when I was a kid,
we would always be late to every-
thing because he'd be doing 14
things during the day."
Eldersveld was considered a
pioneer in ending racial discrimi-
nation in the city, and accord-
ing to Murphy, was the first Ann
Arbor mayoral candidate to cam-
paign in the city's African Ameri-
can neighborhoods and churches.
She added that in the 1960s,
when many congregants left St.
Andrew's Episcopal Church -
where Eldersveld was an active
member for six decades - because
the ministers voiced support for
the civil rights movement, Elder-
sveld stayed at the church.
Eldersveld continued his dedi-
cation to social justice as mayor,
creating Ann Arbor's Human
Relations Commission, , which
aimed to eliminate racial dis-
crimination in housing, banking,
education and business in the
city.
.Eldersveld decided not to run
for reelection in 1959. In 1964 he
became the chair of the Univer-
sity's political science department
- a position he held until 1970.
As chair, Eldersveld turned the

passing legislation to expand cov-
erage to millions who now lack it
and revamp the health insurance
system.
On Capitol Hill, White House
Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and
other senior administration offi-
cials met with House and Senate
Democratic leaders, who have
struggled to secure the votes for
the stalled health care legislation.
The two-step approach now
being pursued calls for the House
to approve a Senate-passed bill
from last year, despite House
Democrats' opposition to several
of its provisions. Both chambers
then would follow by approving
a companion measure to make
changes in that first bill.
"We're going to get it done as
soon as possible," Emanuel told
reporters after the meeting.
White House press secretary
Robert Gibbs has said he expects
the House to actby March 18, the
day Obama leaves for an overseas
trip. That timetable would be
tough to meet, and congressional
leaders told Emanuel on Tuesday
that they don't need deadlines
handed down from the White
House, according to Rep. Henry
Waxman, D-Calif., who chairs
the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and attended Tuesday's
meeting.
"He was certainly informed
that we don't feel that we want
any deadline assigned to us,"
Waxman said.
department into one of the top
political science programs in the
country.
Eldersveld continued to teach
classes at the University until
2000 as a professor emeritus. In
October 2001, the University's
Board of Regents established the
Samuel J. Eldersveld Collegiate
Professorship in Political Science.
A collegiate professorship is one
of the greatest honors the Uni-
versity can bestow upon a faculty
member.
Walton co-authored multiple
publications with Eldersveld
and taught a course on American
political parties with him.
"He did these enormous break-
through worksonpolitical parties
and to get a chance to work with
him was just unbelievable," Wal-
ton said, "One of the great bene-
fits of coming to the University of
Michigan and joining the faculty
was to get an opportunity to work
with him. He was the preeminent
scholar. You can't say it any other
way."
Eldersveld's research was
focused on comparing and ana-
lyzing political parties and politi-
cal elites. He loved to travel and
did so frequently, as he traversed
the globe in order to conduct
research as he studied the politi-
cal systems of India, the Neth-
erlands, Sweden, Great Britain,
Poland and China.
In the classroom, Walton said
Eldersveld was a "dynamic"
teacher who was beloved by his
students and respected by his
peers. In 1999, his former stu-
dents published a book in his
honor, "Comparative Parties and
Party Elites: Essays In Honor of
Samuel J. Eldersveld." He was
also presented with a career
achievement award from the
American Political Science Asso-
ciation in 1986.

Walton helped Eldersveld
write the second edition of his
book "Political Parties in Ameri-
can Society." Walton said that
while working on the book, the
pair would meet for either lunch
or dinner every Wednesday at the
Red Hawk Bar & Grill. Walton
said those weekly meals allowed
him to get to know Eldersveld on
a personal level.
"He was an absolute decent
human being," Walton said. "Lots
of people have great skills and'
immense talent, and Sam was
certainly one of those individuals.
But, in addition to that, he was an
individual fundamentally com-
mitted to social justice."
Murphy said her father was a
fun-loving person who cherished
his family, enjoyed sports and
appreciated all things Ann Arbor.
"He loved Michigan football,"
Murphy said.
Eldersveld is survived by his
wife Els Nieuwenhuijsen, his
children Samuel Eldersveld and
Lucy Murphy, his grandchil-
dren Bethany Gomez and Colin
Murphy, and his great grandson
Finnegan Murphy.

months, beginning last April.
Mahanti said the developers
faced problems that were too dif-
ficult to fix and that he and those
he hired realized the website was
an "institutional failure."
"We realized that the web-
site just wasn't working," he said.
"There were so many things that
went wrong that we couldn't swal-
low all of them."
According to Mahanti, the room
reservation calendar system - a
web application that allows stu-
dents to schedule a room in a Uni-
versity building to study or hold
meetings - was one of the main
obstacles that the developers could
not fix on the website.
Mahanti said his biggest mis-
take throughout the website
design process was that he didn't
fully comprehend the timesheets
for the developers or the cost of the
website until Monday.
Throughout the discussion at
the meeting last night, Mahanti
never blamed the designers for the
cost, but said they never informed
him of how many hours they were
actually working on the website.
"I saw the work getting done,
but I was not aware of the money
being spent or the hours," he said.
Mahanti said that in the future,
MSA payroll needs to be regulated
with more consideration, and the
limit to payroll needs to be decid-
ed in advance. He also said MSA
officials need to thoroughly assess
what MSA staff members are actu-
ally doing for the assembly.
"We as an executive board are
making sure that this will never
happen again," Mahanti said. "I
know the spirit of the website
might not be the highest, but it is an
important tool that MSA needs."
Mahanti has now passed respon-

sibilities of the project to Brusstar.
At last night's meeting, Brusstar
said the main issue with the website
was communication and that the
process needs to be more open. He
said he hopes all the MSA represen-
tatives take part in the process.
"I will try to avoid all the mis-
takes to avoid the quagmire we
have today," Brusstar said at last
night's meeting. "This is abig proj-
ect and needs to be treated like a
big project."
Brusstar added that MSA will
not pour any more funds into
designing the website.
"We will not be spending anoth-
er dollar on this," he said.
MSA TO BRING BIG SEAN,
WALE AND THE
CLIPSE TO CAMPUS
In collaboration with Big Ticket
Productions, the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly is sponsoring a
subsidized concert to be held in
Hill Auditorium for University stu-
dents on March 30.
According to MSA's website, the
concert, called "AA Chillen with
Wale and The Clipse," will feature
performances by hip hop artists
Big Sean, Wale and the Clipse.
MSA representatives expressed
their enthusiasm for the concert at
last night's meeting.
"There's a lot of excitement and
lots of uproar," Bajaj said. "If you're
a fan, be excited, if you are not,
check them out."
MSA has not sponsored a con-
cert since 2005, when Ludacris
performed at Hill Auditorium.
Current MSA representatives
view the 2005 concert as a failure
because few students attended.
In a Feb.17 Michigan Daily arti-
cle, Mahanti said the low atten-
dance may have been because MSA
charged $30 per ticket for the Lud-
acris concert.
At last night's meeting Bajaj said

Wednesday, March 10, 2010 - 3A
he hopes MSA doesn't lose money
like it did on the 2005 concert.
"If we loose $125,000, t won'tbe
able to sleep," he said.
Bajaj said that MSA representa-
tives are planning a huge "market-
ing blitz" to encourage students to
buy tickets for the event.
Tickets will go on sale at the
Michigan Union Ticket Office
starting March 11. Student tickets
sold before the show will cost $10
or $15, depending on the seating.
Non-students will have to pay $20
or $25 for a ticket.
RESOLUTION PASSED
TO BAN EXAMS ON
ELECTION DAYS
Passed in a unanimous vote
last night, the Michigan Student
Assembly approved a resolution
to write a letter to the University
Board of Regents that asks them
to prohibit University exams on
national election days. MSA's Voice
Your Vote Commission - a group
that encourages students to vote on-
campus - proposed the resolution.
According to the resolution, stu-
dents found it difficult to attend
classes during the 2008 presiden-
tial election due to long wait lines
at the election polls. The resolu-
tion stated that students who had
exams on Election Day had to leave
the polls early and missed the
opportunity to vote.
Rock The Vote, a national orga-
nization that encourages young
people to vote, also reported that
scheduled exams caused voting
problems at the University, the res-
olution stated.
MSA Academic Affairs Chair
John Lin, an author of the resolu-
tion, said at the meeting that he
plansto send the letter to the assem-
bly for review as soon as it is drafted.

Love is a legal battlefield
State must allow same-sex marriages
The debate over same-sex marriage has raged across the
nation in the past few years. But though the dispute is
often focused on vital civil rights arguments, the legal
aspects that necessitate legalizing same-sex marriage aren't often
mentioned. But the case of Tammy David and Renee Harmon of
Detroit, who are currently engaged in a custody battle over their
three children after they ended their relationship, is a prime
example of why legalizing same-sex marriage is necessary. Ban-
ning same-sex marriage has limited the legal structures. Same-
sex marriages should be legalized to afford same-sex couples with
equal civil and legal rights.

Not only did I grope him, I tickled him until he
couldn't breathe and then four guys jumped on
top of me. It was my 50th birthday. It was 'kill the
old guy.' You can take anything out of context."
- New York U.S. House Rep. Eric Massas, commenting on allegations that he sexually
assaulted a male staff member, as reported by FoxNews.com yesterday.
Stimulating senselessness

According to a Mar. 8 Detroit Free Press
article, Detroit residents Harmon and
Davis ended their 19-year long partnership
in 2008. Harmon brought a suit against
Davis in the Wayne County Court in Feb-
ruary in an effort to gain joint custody of
the couple's three children. Michigan law
doesn't recognize domestic partnership in
custody proceedings, and because Davis is
the biological mother of all three children,
Harmon has no custodial claims to them.
She must first prove that she has legal
standing to sue.
One of the causes of Harmon's legal bat-
tle is a 2004 Michigan ballot initiative that
defined marriage in the state constitution
as between a man and a woman, effectively
barring all same sex couples from attaining
the same legal and civil benefits heterosex-
ual couples acquire through a legal mar-
riage. Michigan is also one of only six states
that doesn't allow unwed couples - same-
sex or heterosexual - to adopt together.
Preventing same-sex couples from legally
marrying is in itself a gross violation of basic
civil rights. When states ban same-sex mar-
riage, they deny LGBT citizens the equal
rights that they deserve. There is no excuse
for this discrimination. States should legal-
ize same-sex marriage to give all citizens
the rights to which they are entitled.
But banning same-sex marriage has also
prohibited LGBT individuals from shar-

ing in equitable legal and financial ben-
efits. Legally married partners are allowed
certain financial, legal and civil rights not
offered to non-legal marriages. Married
couples are eligible for tax benefits and
greater access to state financial support, as
well as certain insurance benefits. Same-sex
marriage bans have systematically disen-
franchised same-sex couples by excluding
them from these benefits.
Same-sex couples face legal challenges
even though they aren't considered legally
married, and the lack of legislation has
left them without the legal structures they
need. For example, there is currently no
legal structure for both same-sex couples to
maintain equal legal rightsto their children,
though both parents have an investment
and role in the children's lives. Harmon and
Davis's case is only one scenario - custody
questions could also arise should one par-
ent be incapacitated. It is this lack of legal
framework that continues to deny same-sex
couples equal rights and the legal protec-
tions that they need.
Regardless of whether the state recog-
nizes same-sex partnerships as marriages,
these couples face the same challenges as
legally married heterosexual couples. The
state should legalize same-sex marriage to
create legal framework to allow same-sex
couples to deal with legal concerns that all
couples encounter.

little over a year ago, Presi-
dent Barack Obama signed
a $787 billion stimulus bill
intended to create
jobs. In the admin-
istration's view,
the plan is work-
ing like a charm.
Through the end
of October 2009,
the White House
"created or saved"
640,000 jobs since
the stimulus' ALEX
inception, accord- BILES
ing to a Dec. 1 CNN
report. Of course,
this is ignoring the
nearly 4 million jobs lost during that
span, based on a Dec. 3 USA Today
article - a factor of six.
The notion of government creat-
ing or saving jobs is comical enough.
After all, measuring the amount of
jobs "saved" is tantamount to mea-
suring the number of crimes prevent-
ed by the police. In other words, it's
an unverifiable quantity that serves
no purpose besides providing politi-
cal rhetoric.
The Obama administration and
Congress insist on promoting the
myth that government can spend its
way out of the current recession in
spite of elementary logic and histori-
cal examples. Public spending can't
magically revive the economy. And
contrary to the government's asser-
tions, public spending can't create
jobs because it can't create wealth.
The government can only inject
money into the economy if it takes it
from other sources - debt, printing
money or taxation. When govern-
ment drives itself into debt, it leaves
less financial capital for the private
sector to borrow and invest. Taxes
only shift resources from consumers
and producers to the government,
also displacing private investment.
Printing money creates inflation,
devaluing the currency and hurting
the purchasing power of all consum-

ers, especially the poor - the group
that money injected into the economy
reaches last.
The farce that government can
create jobs is grounded in Keynesian
theory, which contends that the end
resultofpublic spending is a multipli-
er effect. This seemingly miraculous
theory postulates that every dollar
the government spends will generate
more than one dollar of new income.
Yet, there is minimal empirical
data - let alone real-world evidence
- to support this delusion. The most
extensive study of the multiplier
was performed in 1991 by Harvard
economist Robert Barro, who found
that each dollar of public spending
produced a mere 80 cent return - in
other words, a loss. in a November
2009 piece for Reason magazine,
economist Veronique de Rugy con-
cludes from Barro's work that "high
government spending actually hurts
economies in the long run by crowd-
ing out private spending and shifting
resources to the uses preferred by
politicians" - namely special inter-
ests and pork barrel projects.
Beyond that, Keynesian theory
holds some pretty bold assump-
tions. There's an inherent belief that
throwing money at the problem will
eventually make it go away. But gov-
ernment spending doesn't address
the cause of the crisis, specifically
loose monetary policy at the hands of
the Federal Reserve. Instead, govern-
ment spending dwells on the symp-
tom that only puts off our proverbial
economic day of reckoning. It's akin
to treating Ebola with an overdose of
Advil to get rid of fever and muscle
pain.
And it's presumed that govern-
ment allocates resources better than
the market during economic slumps.
According to Keynesians, any
decrease in demand and spending
triggers a wave of declining invest-
ment that can lead to a recession.
Their antidote for the economy is
boosting aggregate demand via gov-

Government
spending won't
save the economy.
Plus Keynesian theories predicate
that the government's superpowers
to allocate resources better than the
market only apply during a recession.
When the economy is healthy, these
superpowers magically disappear.
Otherwise, if they didn't go away,
we should have a centrally-planned
economy fueled solely by government
spending all the time. And if they
do go away, I want to know why the
government possesses clairvoyance
during recessions but loses it during
economic expansion.
The fundamental flaw of the 0
stimulus is the idea that government
spending can somehow increase
standard of living or income. All the
government can do is engage in redis-
tribution of money that it takes from
other sources - debt, inflation and
taxation. Crowding out real jobs in
the private sector by entrusting poli-
ticians that are as fallible as any indi-
vidual is not conducive to economic
recovery. I'm as keen as anybody
else to rise out from this recession.
Reconsidering the government's'bad
economic thinking is a logical place
to start.

ernment spending. obviously there's
a decreased level of investment, but
that's a result of increased risk - not
a lack of desire to consume. For some
reason, they believe that politicians
remain immune to the recession's
effects and can see long-term eco-
nomic effects more clearly than the
private sector.

magine if you were told that
you were in a lottery and would
receive food and water only if

nario is similar to
what is happen-
ing in many public
schools. Parents A

child's name into

a spot in their
area's best public
or charter school. BRITTANY
Receiving the best SMITH
possible educa-
tion should not be
a luxury only for
those who make the pick of the draw,
and policy makers shouldn't be will-
ing to accept this situation.
There is a real, ongoing and ever-
growing achievement gap between
students of color in underprivileged
areas and privileged white students.
For example, 17 of Detroit's 22 high
schools - which primarily have
African-American students - are
low-performing high schools com-
pared to schools in other parts of
the state, according to an Associated
Press report from July 2009. On the
other hand, the primarily white and
affluent Grosse Pointe Public School
System is considered to be among the
nation's best public districts.
Nonprofit organizations like
Breakthrough Collaborative, Prep
for Prep, The Jackie Robinson Foun-
dation, The Algebra Project and The
Young People's Project are dedicated
to bridging this achievement gap.
There is a considerable amount of
scholarly research and media atten-
tion being brought to this American
social defect. And even with such
efforts, the public school education
system has reached a state of inequal-
ity and dysfunction that is treated by
many as beyond repair.
The problems facing many public
schools include overcrowded class-
rooms, insufficient numbers of text-
books, a lack of parental involvement

and deficiencies in the availability of
resources like tutoring services and
academic preparation for college. In
many instances, students in under-
privileged schools experience poor
education starting in elementary
and middle schools, making it more
difficult for them to succeed in high
school and college.
While the challenges that face
youth in underserved communities
are many and significant, there is a
great deal of opportunity for growth
and improvement. There has been
plenty of dialogue about the prob-
lems that inner-city educational sys-
tems face. What is lacking is genuine
change through action.
The. disparities occurring in the
publicschool education system areper-
haps the biggest disgrace to this coun-
try. This issue should receive much
higher priority from policy makers and
deserves as much priority as has been
given to the economic crisis. In many
cases, public opinion is crafted by the
media, and to a large extent, it is the
media that decides what should be a
priority on the political agenda. As a
student who was educated inthe public
school system and a worker whose tax
dollars fund public education, I want
the rehabilitation of public schools
to be given as much attention in the
media and on the legislative agenda as
the health care bill. And I can't help but
notice that ithasn't.
Public schools in America are expe-
riencing one of the same problems
that is hurting health care and affect-
ing the American economy: a lack of
oversight and intervention. Not long
ago, I heard Bob Moses, founder of
The Algebra Project, name the state
of public school education as the
"most blatant display of Jim Crow"
practices still in establishment. It's
unacceptable that this country and
policy makers in Washington D.C. are
allowing unequal education to exist.
It's unacceptable that the quality of
education that many students receive
is being decided by a lottery pick.
Statistical data often documents that

a student's access tof opportunities
is determined by the caliber of the
school that the child attends. Davis
Guggenheim - who directed the
Oscar-winning 2006 global warm-
ing documentary "An Inconvenient
Truth" and is returning this year
with "Waiting For Superman," a doc-
umentary that tackles hidden truths
about public school education - has
correctly pointed out that "medioc-
rity and dysfunction" are dominating
public education. The issue desper-
ately needs attention and action.
We must fix the
acheivement gap in
public schools.*
This is an issue that should be
dealt with in public debate. But while
health care and the financial crisis
have received plenty of legislative
response, the equally important issue.
of disparities in public education con-
tinues to be largely unaddressed by
the U.S. Congress.
We might like to live in a country
where the American dream is acces-
sible to anyone who can pull himself
or herself by the bootstraps. But this
ideal is at odds with a public education
system that creates and perpetuates
unequal access to the opportunities,
education and skills necessary for suc-
cess. The lottery of educational oppor-
tunity is unfair and has high stakes,
and many students of color within a
failing public school systems continue
to have the odds stacked against them.
Policy-makers at thefederal level need
to direct their attention to this prob-
lem and take concrete steps to bridge
the achievement gap present through-
out this country.

A bad call for NBC

Poetry crosses space
and time on way to 'U'

Seinfeld's newest
series is 'The
Newlywed Game'
gone horribly wrong
By LINDSAY HURD
DailyArts Writer
When a show features both Tina
* Fey and Jerry Seinfeld as guest
judges, one would think it would be
a comedic gold
mine, right?
Wrong. Every-
thing about The Marriage
"The Marriage Ref
Ref" is cringe-
worthy at best. Thursdays
You watch in at10 p.m.
horror as Sein- NBC
feld loses much
of his comedy-
god status. How can a show that
both stars and is produced by Sein-
feld be such an epic failure? Two
words: Tom Papa.
Host Tom Papa is like that kid
in high school who really tried
to be funny but just wasn't, and
clearly it's carrying over to his TV
career. Every time one of the judges
makes a genuinely funny comment,
Papa chimes in with nonsense that
makes you want to change the
channel. When Tina Fey made fun
of a wife who would only let her,
husband eat at the dining room
table on Thanksgiving - "Maybe
we should substitute words in
her argument to make her realize
how crazy she sounds. Like say-
ing the bathroom is only for Eas-

Because if anyone can save your marrage, its Tom Papa.

ter!" - Tom Papa chimed in with a
brilliant joke: "Do you know what
I would hate? Dust! Dust every-
where. Happy Thanksgiving!"
How does that even make any
sense? Tom Papa is in need of a
serious wake-up call.. And the
worst part is, Seinfeld doesn't see it.
Tom Papa gets in the way, ulti-
mately because of the setup of the
show. He's the actual marriage ref
who uses celebrity panel judges
to help him decide if the husband
or the wife is right. Different sets
of couples come on the show and
present their arguments to Papa
and the panel, and in the end, Papa
tells either the husband or wife
who is right. Therefore, in order
to have a successful show about a
"Marriage Ref," you need someone
who can actually succeed at that
task without being a tool.
The show is so bad that it makes
funofitself.Papaevenadmits atone

point: "Why do we care? We don't!"
Whenever the husband and wife
are talkingabouttheirproblem, the
panel degrades them and makes
them feel like complete nimrods.
It's "The Newlywed Game" gone
wrong, where the couples look like
fools and the problems they're hav-
ing aren't actually "real" problems.
Instead, the show focuses on issues
like a husband grooming himself
too much, a wife who won't let her
husband eat at the dining room
table and a wife who flosses in bed.
Not exactly marriage-threatening
issues, to say the least.
Overall, "The Marriage Ref"
needs to get rid of Tom Papa, the
cheesy music and the random
woman they call the "fact lady"
who adds useless tidbits that no
one cares about, and should prob-
ably let Seinfeld be the actual mar-
riage ref. Or just cancel the show
altogether.

England duplex- HelmutStern
es to Greek myths Auditorium
to Mont Blanc
on the French-
Italian border. Her last few lines
describe moving "through eons
/ & hemispheres in a white clap-
board house." Leaping through
time and space and different
allusions, Dennigan's poems still
remain grounded.
An alumna of the University's
MFA program, Dennigan is return-
ing to join with Assistant Professor
of English Tung-Hui Hu for a poet-
ry readingthis Thursday. The MFA
Program in Creative Writing is pre-
senting the event as part of the Zell
Visiting Writers Lecture Series.
At the University, Hu teaches
courses on time-based poetry and
art, which comes into play in film,
installation art and performance.
Time-based art is a term most often
used to describe moving image and
sound workby visual artists.

"Time-based art is a way of
lumping together art that unfolds
in time," Hu said. "I use it to refer,
generally speaking, to moving
image artworks after the 1960s.
I've been interested in the way
(time-based art) is not a static
experience."
This Thursday he willbe reading
from his new collection of poems,
"Greenhouses, Lighthouses." With
a Ph.D. in film studies, Hu explores
many cinematic themes and
images. The winner of the 2007
James D. Phelan Literary Award,
"Greenhouses, Lighthouses" was
described by the San Francisco
Foundation as "a provocative ges-
ture toward cinematography."
The collection is written as a
series of palinodes - odes or songs
in which the writer retracts some-
thing written in a previous poem.
"This is a form that lots of other
writers have used," Hu said.
Hu cited "Chaucer's Retrac-
tion" at the end of "The Canterbury
Tales," in which Chaucer asks for
forgiveness for his coarse language
throughout his works, as one exam-
ple. One of Hu's poems in "Green-
houses, Lighthouses" is modeled on
the Corrections section of a news-
paper.
Whether he is teaching or writ-
ing, Hu said that he stresses "the
process of description over analy-
sis." It makes sense, then, that the
reading on Thursday will likely
stand for itself instead of focusing

on discussion or analysis.
"What does the poem do, how
does it try to say what it says, what
does it sound like, etc.," Hu said.
"My sense is that it's really tough to
come up with language to describe
something well."
In an e-mail interview, Denni-
gan reflected on the role that poets
like herself play in the world.
"No matter how people become
poets ... isn't the world better off
having all these super awkward,
trail-mix consuming pencil chew-
Through poetry,
we digest life as
though it were a
cupcake.
ers around to try and digest little
pockets of life - even if it is their
own narrow life - the way that
some of us digest Entenmann's
cupcakes?" Dennigan said.
While there is a small audience
for the consumption of serious
poetry, poetry readings at book-
stores and campuses are becoming
increasingly popular. Dennigan
and Hu, with their wit and cre-
ativity, should present an engaging
poetry reading - but bring your
own cupcakes.

By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Editor
With his playing days at Crisler
Arena finished and with the Wol-
verines' postseason hopes resting
solely on an improbable run in the
Big Ten Tournament, senior for-
ward DeShawn Sims took some
time yesterday to reflect on the past
year for the Michigan basketball
team.
And if the inconsistent Wol-
verines want to go anywhere in
the tournament which starts this
Thursday, they will need the usu-
ally reliable Sims to power them
past a daunting list of foes, start-
ing with a potential matchup Fri-
day with No. 5 Ohio State should
Michigan defeat Iowa in its first
round game.
For Sims, it is a somber reality
that his playing days in the Maize
and Blue are coming to a close. But
the senior still has the Big Ten Tour-
nament squarely on his mind.
"I'm just going in to it thinking
about playing Iowa. Getting my
mind refreshed after Saturday's
loss," Sims said.
The senior is second on the team

in scoring, averaging 16.9 points per
game this season, and was named to
the second team All-Big Ten. Other
than Michigan'swin over Connecti-
cut, the Wolverines have lost each
time Sims has scored fewer than 12
points this season.
For Sims, the disappointment
began early in the season. After
Michigan started as the nation's
15th-ranked team, the Wolverines'
goals were dashed as their many
flaws were revealed.
At the Old Spice Tournament in
Orlando, Fla., Michigan fell to both
unranked Marquette and Alabama,
its firstlosses of the season.
"We went into it playing some
teams thatweren'treally good and it
just exposed a lot of our weaknesses
and it was kind of hard to bounce
back from it," Sims said.
From there, the season spiraled
downwardwith keylosses downthe
stretch in the Big Ten regular sea-
son, with a one point loss to Michi-
gan State athome and two key losses
to Wisconsin.
Despite the disappointment, Sims
still shined. The senior led the Wol-
verines with 28 points in Michigan's
upset win over then-15th-ranked
Ohio State and nearly propelled
Michigan past Michigan State in
Ann Arbor before his buzzer-beat-
ing layup attempt rimmed out.
But with the Big Ten Tourna-
ment just two days away, Sims and
his teammates know that they really
have nothingto lose.

Michigan coach John Beilein
announced this week that the team
would not participate in the Col-
lege Basketball Invitation, which
selects teams after the NCAA
Tournament and NIT and was
Michigan's only likely postseason
destination.
That being the case, Sims and
the Wolverines realize that it is all
or nothing in Indianapolis. After a
blowout 64-48 loss to No. 11 Michi-
gan State, Michigan will once again
have to try to rebound after a blow
to its confidence.
"We've bounced back after some
very disappointing losses this year,
we've done it not consistently but
we've bounced back," Beilein said.
"This is another one of those times
when I hope we have a bounce back
and that will be our only intention."
While Sims realizes that his
career at Michigan is in its twi-
light, he still is keeping optimistic
about the Wolverines' chances this
weekend. And if Michigan has any
chance to pull an improbable come-
back, it will need its senior leader to
loosen up the team for tough run.
"Once you know that you have to
put it all on the line and you don't
have another game, it's easier to play
that way," Sims said. "We knew had
another game after Michigan State
and another game after Minnesota.
If you know you get another chance
you kind of take it for granted but
if you know there's not another
chance you put it all out there."

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Senior forward DeShawn Sims, seen here in the Wolverines' Jan.17 win over Connecticut, averages 16.9 points per game and
was named to the second team All-Big Ten.

Captain Summers
likely out with
lower-body injury

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
As Chris Summers faced the
Yost Ice Arena student section for
the final time Saturday, no one in
the crowd noticed.
There was no reaction when the
senior captain took one stride out
to the outside of the faceoff circle,
made a looping turn and coasted
before stepping on the bench.
Maybe it was because it was
during a TV timeout in the first
period of Saturday's blowout of
Lake Superior State.
or maybe it was because the
crowd expected him back after
what Michigan coach Red Beren-
son later described as a lower-
body injury - after all, Summers
had missed just three games his
whole career.

Hogan went out with a groin inju-
ry in the first period against Notre
Dame on Feb. 25 and has yet to

has filled the void in goal for the
past four games, registering two

By now, Michigan is used to
rallying around players who are
forced to step in for injured star
players.

worried about Shawn Hunwick
because they are going to make

crowd of about 100, and congratu-
lated Peterson on behalf of the Uni-
versity.
"Our university is not only an
academic institution; it is a cam-
pus that is devoted to the holistic
growth of our students," Brandon
said. "Great teachers like Chris
Peterson are passionate about
making an impact on their stu-
dents' lives."
Peterson was introduced by
Nansook Park, an associate profes-
sor of psychology at the University,
who said Peterson had earned the
nickname "Mother Theresa" in the
Psychology Department because of
his kindness.
"Chris is a great teacher not
because he is perfect, but because
he never stops trying to be a better
one," Park said.
Park added that in addition to
Peterson's commitment to teach-
ing, he is one of the top 100 cited
psychologists in the world.
Psychology Prof. Albert Cain
also spoke before Peterson gave
his lecture and said Peterson
has deservedly received so many
awards, adding with a laugh that
the University may soon consider
imposing a limit.

Peterson started his lecture
by acknowledging the previous
awards he has won, but said the
Golden Apple Award is by far the
most meaningfulto him. The recip-
ient of the Golden Apple Award is
chosen from a pool of nominations
made by students.
"This is not one of the presti-
gious awards at the University
of Michigan, this is the prestige
award," Peterson said.
During his lecture, Peterson
said all University professors
deserve apples and proceeded to
throw apples to his colleagues in
the audience.
Peterson, who is considered
a pioneer in the field of positive
psychology, said while he may be
associated with positive psychol-
ogy, he wouldn't talk shop during
his lecture.
But Peterson did speak briefly
about his area of expertise, encour-
aging all students to go one day
without using the word "but" and
all of its similes, a technique called
active constructive responding.
"How we respond to good news
that is given to us is what predicts
our relationships better than how
we respond to bad news," he said.
Peterson said though he's grate-
ful for the award, he thinks there
is a great importance in students
learning from each other.

"I think it's great that you're
honoring me as a teacher tonight,"
Peterson said. "But who are we kid-
ding? Students will always learn
more from each other than they
ever will learn from their profes-
sors."
Peterson also talked about his
work on the Fall 2010 LSA Theme
Semester called, "What makes life
worth living?" He said he hopes the
semester will focus on art, music,
literature, religion and, above all,
service to others.
ParksaidoneofPeterson'sgreat-
est qualities is his ability to give so
much to his students, noting that
he even gives advice to strangers
when the two travel together to
give academic speeches. When she
asked him how he could give so
much of himself he said it's because
it's the right thing to do.
"Other people matter," Peterson
repeated throughout the lecture.
"Other people matter and we are
all other people to everyone else."
LSA junior Huey Cheng, a for-
mer student , of Peterson, said
though he enjoyed the lecture, he
thinks just one lecture doesn'tfully
demonstrate Peterson's exception-
al teaching style.
"It's hard to sum up everything
that he gave throughout the entire
semester in just one small lecture,"
Cheng said.

THELITERATUREISSUE
editors' note
TO our readers,
This week, we bring you The Statement's annual Literature Issue. After soliciting work from students for the past two months - advertising in the pages of
this magazine, posting flyers all over campus and asking everyone we knew - we've combed through the hundreds of poems and short stories submitted and
have come up with what we believe tobe some of the best undergraduate creative writing this University has to offer.
There's a short story about going to the bathroom on an airplane, a poem about the sexuality of animals and a piece of flash fiction about a dead woman in a bathtub.
Though most undergraduate writing can be trite, simple and juvenile, the writers whose work is displayed in this issue demonstrate avoice and complexity of thought
often missing from the work of their peers. We could only fit a select few in print, but check out the rest online at michigandaily.com/the-statement.
Enjoy,
Trevor Calero and Allie White, Magazine Editor and Deputy Magazine Editor

A right, don't panic. Calm.
Collected. Untroubled. Don't
breathe too fast. Don't look
down too much. Assuage. Temper-
ance. Relieve. Rest. Reprieve. Is
reprieve a befitting synonym? Is
she dead? She's dead. There is a
dead, naked woman in your bathtub.
And what a bathtub! An iron-clad
claw foot bathtub with solid brass
fixtures and a marble soap dish. A
beautiful standalone unit, on tiger
paws beneath the Southern ac-
cent window coverings, decorated
toward the ambition of a delicate
ambiance, perfect for... reprieve.
You should probably unlace your
shoes. Pink bathwater is spilling
onto your tiled floor. Most guests
agree they afford the room a rustic
dignity - these polished desert yel-
low Jerusalem Stone tiles, quarried
from Palestine and laid with the
utmost attention to detail. My God,
they must think, what magnificent
tiles!
You came home and there she
was. There she is, blue and getting
grayer. "Death," you tell yourself,
"poor, poor girl. Maybe I could have
tried to afford a better bathtub to
die in. I'm honest. Believe me, my
wife will be home in an hour. I need
to wash my hands and pledge sixty
sit-ups an evening to keep her inter-
est." You shouldalso trim your nails.
And remember to buy potpourri.,
The faucet is not running. The ap-
plication ofther makeup indicates
a precise attention to detail. The
absence of clothing, the soft curve
of her neck, her choice of setting
begs a pertinent question ... but
whsich one? What runs through the
mind of a dying naked woman in a
strange colonial bathroom at four in
the afternoon?
What do the neighbors think?
Johnson McCantley next door,
most likely on his couch - a gaudy
black leather sectional - thinks, no
doubt all the time, about bathing
in this room. You can see it in his
eyes when he says hello walking
past, green with envy. It's hard to
stay humble. Johnson's wife left
him last August. Keeping a wife is
very important. She fell in love with
another man when she found Jesus,
an unruly-haired Mexican gentle-
man who touched her inthe park
one afternoon.
Your bathroom is rich with thera-
peutic candles of assorted floral
scents. "I enjoy the finer things in
life," you tell yourself, "my wife is
very beautiful." Which she is. The
envy of other wives. The girl's finger

twitches slightly. Look at her. She
looks like your wife on the wedding
night. Not gray...,but very young.
And twitchy. She looked lively in the
hotel bed on the honeymoon night,
staring up at you, an air of sensual-
ity. You re-arranged the chairs sev-
eral times to promote a lascivious
atmosphere and domesticate certain
animal urges. While the last woman
you will ever sleep with lay there,
waiting. She said, "For Christ's sake,
Walter, you're more concerned with
establishing a setting than focusing
on the task at hand."
The girl's fingernails are painted
red, at least the five not underwater.
Blood is pouring down the arms.
The terrycloth towels are still in the
closet. A pink nipple rises like an is-
land in an ocean of diluted ketchup.
The fingers are starting to curl into
themselves. No, no, you shouldn't
smell her hair. A clear view of the
legs is lost at the shin, under the
water. The knees appear not too
knobby and she has small, delicate
toes. Alright, calm down. Focus. It
is very warm in this bathroom. You
should roll up your sleeves, you
should loosen your tie - a very crisp
necktie woven from Italian silk
and very distinguished sleeves of
the highest thread count. Breathe.
Your wife will be home in an hour.
She promised to cook your favorite
dish, rosemary chicken marinated
in lemon and black pepper. And
perhaps this smell will have begun
to fade. Can't have the place reeking
to high heaven with a rosemary
chicken on the premises. Your house
is protected by a lovely red oak
door. Your wife still insists on that
eyesore of a welcome mat. She can
be quite difficult sometimes, insist-
ing on that ratty doormat, with tat-
tered fibers and 'Welcome' spelled
in faded-green block letters. One
should never welcome anything on
such obvious terms. It's gaudy and
out of place. It used to belong to her
grandmother's country porch. She
argues it has value of sentiment. It
has been linked with kind memories
and thus, is justified. You begged
her to consider a thin rug or rococo
placemat. She is very difficult. This
doormat upsets the balance of your
entrance. People will make assump-
tions. But your wife, your wife is
fond of something that does not be-
long, preoccupied with such a small
detail - God bless her - you do not
want the doormat, your wife insists
on the doormat. Such is the nature
of life, caught in the pull, trying to
approach an impossible situation.

We could go to the cornfields

they were the avenues of Paris. The

as we wandered between cafes and
verdant parks. Then we could turn a

A Hypochondriac's Dilemma

had planned to be home three
hours and twenty-seven min-
utes ago. I had not planned to
wait on the tarmac for an hour
and eight minutes and counting.
I am regretting eating break-
fast now. The hotel the interviewer
put me up in was shitty, and the din-
ing room was filthy. I'm sure a rotten
egg was what was causing me dis-
tress, but I can't go to the bathroom
on the airplane. I think of E. coli and
SARS and swine flu. I'm sorry, H1N1.
I think of the obese man, two rows
back in the aisle seat, and imagine
his sweat dripping over the toilet
rim and onto the rest of the metal
box surrounding the hole. I think of
the crying kid, a couple rows ahead
of me, who I saw run to vomit a few
minutes ago because he was nervous.
I can't go to the bathroom on an air-
plane. But I can't just sit here. The
situation is getting desperate. My
bowels are aching and the muscles in
my legs and ass are squeezed as hard
as they can be. I can't wait another
couple hours until I am home to my
bleached clean bathroom.
I unbuckle my seatbelt because
the sign says that's okay. I get up. I
walk to the back of the plane. One,
two, three, four, five, six rows. Then
the obese man. Seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven aisles and I'm there. The
door says vacant so I pull the edges of
my sleeve over my hand and use it to
unlatch the handle and push. When
I lock it behind me, the automatic
light flickers on and hums, making
my brain feel fuzzy. The grayness of
the room and the dull, dead skin col-
ored quality of fluorescent light bulbs
makes me look much older than I
am. Or maybe that's the stress. I pull
at the wrinkles around my eyes and
pretend my skin is much younger,
and more taught. It seems like a new
line shows up every day that I am
unemployed. I need to find a job soon
or I will shrivel into a raisin.
I stop looking and start tearing
pieces of toilet paper to cover the
seat. I can't touch it. I cover the seat
and seven inches of the surrounding
metal. I'm not that big, but what ifI
lose my balance and end up slightly
left? I put an extra layer on. Yes, it's
a waste of paper, but that's not real-
ly what's important right now. I sit
down carefully, so as not to disturb
the sheets of tissue and relax as I let
myself empty. I sigh with my head
leaned back and my eyes closed gen-
tly and let my muscles loosen. After

a minute, I bring my head back down
and open my eyes. There, in the cor-
ner behind the door, pinched into
the hinge is a twenty-dollar bill. Its
frayed edges and overall crumpled
demeanor speak of a fall from an
overstuffed back pocket as its owner
pulled up their jeans.
I contemplate the twenty. That's
a lot of money to me, now. A couple
years ago I could have ignored it, but
now that infected bill is almost as
vital to my life as the soap I carry in
my bag, or the rubber gloves I wear
in the subway. I need that twenty for
dinner. You wouldn't expect find-
ing a job to be so expensive. This
round-trip ticket cost $287.63 with
tax. I don't even think they are going
to hire me. That's $287.63 of the
$2,782.68 I have left. That seems like
it could last you a while, but it won't.
I think of the twenty-seven pounds
of rice I could buy. That's sixty-seven
cups of uncooked rice. So at the rateI
am going, that could be almost thirty-
three days of food. I need that twen-
ty. I look at the floor of the bathroom.
I look and see grime in the fake grout
of the linoleum tiles. I look and see
the sticky film that covers the floor
and think of how that is all over the
twenty now. I imagine E. coli, SARS,
and HINT tickling Andrew Jackson's
nose as they squirm on his face.
I think of the swirlies of elemen-
tary school. The taste of toilet water
on my tongue. The smell of stagnant
sulfuric water it left permanently in
my nose. I think of when I got sick in
second grade. The stomach flu is not
kind to a young kid. It's not kind to
anyone really. IfI pick up the twenty,
maybe I won't be eating for thirty-
three days anyways. Bacteria and
viruses could take away my need for
that money.
I think of ways to pick it up with-
out being exposed. I could use my
sleeve to shield my fingers, but what
would I do with it? I couldn't put it
in my wallet; everything would be
exposed. Normally, I would just zap
it with my germicidal UV light, but
they made me check it. I'm not sure
if you could actually blind the pilot
with it, but that is what they claim.
I couldn't put it in my pocket; I could
never use the pocket again. I suppose
I could wash it, but I once read an
article that washing your hands in an
airplane bathroom makes them more
dirty than they were before because
the water is germ ridden and the
soap is not very strong. I could put

out from behind her unruly hair.

opsy.
Vhen the time came for the burial,
stood shivering next to her siblings
jacket too light for November. She

thought of all the dead below her and
felt sad that they would be stationary
forever. She felt sad for the trees whose
leaves are granted the privilege of
flight while they themselves are forced
to remain rooted. She felt sad for those
who are emotionally bound to others
when they'd like nothing more than
to be free. All of this sadness seemed
entirely inappropriate for her grand-
mother's funeral.
That day, Ruby had worn formal
shoes that uncomfortably exposed
her toes and, when she tried to walk

closer to the grave, she found that the
spiky heels had gotten stuck in the
partially frozen ground of the cem-
etery. Hard as she tried, she couldn't
move from where she stood. Panicked
by the notion of being trapped in one
place, she slipped out of the shoes
and wrenched them out of the earth
with her hands. She stood barefoot
and squeezed the cold, frosty grass
between her toes, grateful for her
mobility. Tiny flecks of snow began to
swirl down to the earth, and before
she reminded herself that she didn't

believe in Heaven, she briefly imagined
that her grandmother was sitting up
there mischievously shaking dandruff
out of her hair and onto the funeral
party as a last laugh. Deciding that
that was actually repulsive and com-
pletely unlike her grandmother, Ruby
envisioned another scene: she imag-
ined that the snow was the energy her
grandmother had used in the eighty
years she had lived, falling back to the
ground to be soaked up and eventually
to sprout new beings. After all, life was
never lost, just redistributed.

hand sanitizer all over it, I guess. But
they took my over three-ounce bottle
when I went through security and
the other bottle Ihave is in my bag in
my seat. I think the attendants might
get suspicious.
A knock on the door: "Sir? Are you
okay? You need to finish up soon. We
have clearance for take off and we
have to get off the ground within the
next couple minutes or we'll miss our
chance. I need you to return to your
seat and fasten your safety restraint."
I guess I've been sitting here for a
while. "Um ... yeah, I'll be right out,

let me finish real quick."
"Okay, please hurry." It was deci-
sion time. Pick it up and be sure to
have some food. An extra thirty-
three day cushion to find a new job.
Leave it and I can guarantee my
safety, at least from sickness. I think
of the economy. I think of the unem-
ployment rate. I think of the three
hundred and two people dead in the
U.S. alone from H1N1. I reach out and
pause, fingers millimeters from the
bill. Another knock.
A stern man's voice: "Sir, please.
We need to take off now. Come out or

and my fingers close. I've touched
it. There's no going back. I've given
myself a new meaning for the phrase
filthy rich. I gag and a shudder runs
down my shoulders. Muscles tense
and I can feel my sweat glands prick-
le on my forearms and my legs. I'm
nervous, but I cram the bill into my
jeans pocket. I feel a bulge growing
in my throat, but I open the door. I
walk back to my seat and buckle up.
The plane pushes me into my seat
cushions and I hold my hand away
from my body.

Reflections
By aby ar ten
nsteadoffeelingexcited whenev-
er anyone announced that he or
she had adopted a new puppy or
other infant pet, Ruby immedi-
ately felt a pang of sympathy, for
her first thought was never of the
happy life that the owner would share
with the animal, but rather that the
puppy or kitten or domesticated rodent
would die one day. She thought of how
sad the owner would be if his puppy
were to be run over by a plump middle-
aged woman on a rainy day driving
home in a car with failing windshield
wipers, or how devastating if, when
the owner goes to the vet for an annual
checkup, hefinds out that in its old age,
the pet has jaw cancer or is blind in one
eye.

Likewise, whenever a new romantic
relationship began, she allowed herself
only a fleeting moment of happiness
before accepting with grim stoicism
that the relationship would inevitably
fail. In turn, she stopped beginning,
and, for that matter, ending, relation-
ships altogether, and found comfort in
meaningless nights with men whose
last names she never knew. For such
nights freed her from the pesky bur-
den of having to care about something
that would eventually become a man-
gled, distorted, disappointing version
of itself. Her acute awareness of tem-
porality pressed on her, and resulted
in unbound cynicism and a paralyzed
gaze that constantly focused on end-
ings.
That day, seated in the second row
at her grandmother's funeral, sur-
rounded by relatives who were more
like strangers, she listened to sadness
and mucus rhythmically bursting
out of the noses of those present,
and much to her surprise, discov-
ered a piece of dried oatmeal on
her scarf. She reviewed her most
recent clothing choices. It was
early November, which meant
she had not worn the scarf since
approximately late February of
that year. The scarf had hung
neglected in the back of her closet
during the spring and summer, and

the oatmeal had clung to it for those
months. She admired its loyalty, and
realized she had never stuck with any-
thing that long. She wondered if the
scarf had felt the oatmeal's presence,
like an itch, and if the oatmeal had felt
lonely and confused as to how it had
ended up in a place so very different
from its intended location of Ruby's
digestive tract. She picked at the oat-
meal, and after a bit of difficulty - the
result of a lifetime of incessant nail bit-
ing - scraped the crusty remnant off
the fabric and absentmindedly brushed.
it to the floor. She was certain that
when she had poured that unremark-
able flake of oatmeal, one of hundreds
of flakes in a blueberry flavored packet
that came in a Quaker's Instant Oat-
meal Variety Box, into a microwave-
safe bowl with three-quarters of a cup
of milk seven months ago, the piece of
oatmeal in question never would have
imagined it would one day end up on a
funeral home's carpet amid salty tears
and the mysterious white dust that bil-
lows off of Kleenexes. Ruby thought of
all the places she had ended up without
intention, and realized she had more in
common with the piece of old oatmeal
than she felt comfortable admitting.
She refocused her attention on the
frail minister who was delivering a
vague sermon about pain and loss, and
to pass the time, she imagined him
dressed in a bunny costume, then won-
dered if that was disrespectful. This
was the third funeral she had attended
since her own birth, and at each, she
became progressively more troubled
by how little emotion she allowed her-
self to feel. While her younger sister
lost close to six ounces of tears that
day alone, Ruby's eyes stayed obnox-
iously dry, even though she had many
more memories of her grandmother
to cry over. She attributed this to
the fact that she had known this day
would come since she became aware

of human mortality at a very early age.
For as long as she could remember,
when she found herself in big crowds
she wondered who would die first out
of everyone present. It wasn't a dark
or dangerous curiosity, but a matter-
of-fact acknowledgement that life is
temporary.
Ruby lapsed into phases of appre-
ciation for obscure animals, notable
historical figures and celebrities or
academic subjects, and she obtained
the Funeral Plans notebook during
her Pug Phase when she was ten. She
adored pugs, and three weeks into
her obsession, had made five visits to
the pet store to gaze at them, though
she never held or touched them out
of an unspoken fear that they would
uncontrollably urinate on her cloth-
ing. She had drawn several pictures of
them on pages secretly stolen from her
brother's sketchbook, and choosing to
ignore her father's fur allergy, wrote
an official petition for the adoption of
one into the family. She had asked each
of her fourth-grade classmates to sign
the petition, though only three actu-
ally did, and along with a scribble in
red crayon that indicated her three-
year-old sister's commitment to the
Pug Campaign, the meager five sig-
natures she presented did nothing to
cure allergies or convince her mother
to replace her father with the pug.
It was then she documented her
funeral plans in the notebook, where
they remained long after the Pug
Phase had morphed into the Gnome
Phase, which became the Regis Phil-
bin Phase. She tweaked the plans
periodically. For several years she had
wanted her funeral service and burial
to be televised, with coverage by at
least three localnews stations. She had
wanted her funeral to be a raving party
after sitting through her great-grand-
father's painfully boring service, and
at one point had willed her entire life

savings to PBS. Only one aspect of her
original plan remained, and that was
for her cremated ashes to be placed
in an hourglass. The intended recipi-
ent of the hour glass had changed over
the years - in fourth grade, it was to
be inherited by her best friend Katie
but after Katie had lost Ruby's favorite
pen, the one that didn't write very well
but had other redeeming qualities like
feathers attached to the end, later that
year, she furiously crossed her name
out and replaced it with a question
mark to indicate her future firstborn
offspring. No matter upon whose man-
tel the hourglass containing her ashes
would one day sit, the most important
thing to her was that even after she had
left the earth, she would still be able to
remind the living that their time was
running out.
In the stuffy, crowded room that
contained a body that had been living
only days ago, Ruby was reminded yet
again of how quickly things change,
as she often was in elementary school
when she spent hours laying on the
trampoline in her backyard, watching
the clouds and the trees transform.
Convinced she would one day be an
Olympic gymnast, she would jump
and flip tirelessly on the magic elastic
blacktop until her muscles were on
the verge of collapse. When she could
barely breathe, she lay on her back and
focused on the tree branches above her
head, the ones she could never touch
no matter how high she jumped. She
noticed that everything in nature was
constantly redistributed in a care-
ful balance. In her earliest years, she
thought that leaves had a monoga-
mous relationship with trees. She
imagined that they would fall off for
a while to explore - to see the world
their rooted home didn't allow them to
experience - then return to their des-
ignated branch, refreshed and green.
The hours spent staring at the shifting
world convinced her at an early age
that time was not linear. She believed
instead that life is one giant moment
that perpetually rearranged itself.
She thought of the hours she spentat
her grandmother's home during child-
hood. Her grandmother picked her and
her brother Ollie up from school every
day, and Ruby liked the routine of such
afternoons. She would scramble into
the back seat of the beige Taurus that
always smelled like combinations of
soil, fresh green beans, newspapers,
mold and old people, and her grand-
mother would roll the window down
and ask if there was "too much air."
Ruby hated the open window, and the
air that rushed in loudly and tousled
her hair and stung her eyes, but never
once did she complain. When they
arrived to her grandmother's home,
Ruby ate a snack - always Club crack-
ers with cheese and a very ambiguous
"orange drink" - then she and Ollie sat
at the kitchen table and wrote stories
and drew pictures until it grew dark
outside and their grandmother would
wander in and express her deepest
concern that they would ruin their
eyes from straining to see the paper
and colors before them. The lighting of
the room never troubled them.
One thing that did concern them,
though, was that their grandmother

changed names, changed stories, changed lives,
or maybe he'll search my trunk and
discover my dirty little secret.
I had nowhere else
to hide the bodies.

Ruby ... realized she
had more in common
with the piece of old
oatmeal than she felt
comfortable admitting."
