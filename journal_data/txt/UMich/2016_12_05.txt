The 
University 
of 

Michigan 
was 
ranked 

among the nation’s top three 
schools for undergraduate 
entrepreneurship 
opportunities and sixth for 
graduate 
entrepreneurship 

by 
The 
Princeton 
Review 

in 
a 
November 
release. 

Only Babson University in 
Massachusetts and Brigham 
Young 
University 
in 
Utah 

surpassed the University on the 
undergraduate list.

The annual rankings take 

into consideration business and 
entrepreneurship 
academic 

programs available to students, 

student-to-faculty 
ratio, 

alumni 
entrepreneurship 

ventures, student-led programs 
and community support for 
entrepreneurial ventures.

Formal 
entrepreneurship 

education 
opportunities 
at 

the University date back to 
1999 with the creation of 
the Zell Lurie Institute, an 
entrepreneurship and venture 
capital-focused 
institute 

housed at the Ross School of 
Business.

In 2015, the Zell Family 

Foundation 
donated 
$60 

million 
to 
the 
Zell

Institute. 

Oscar Ybarra, the director

Sunday, 
the 
Michigan 

Foreign Policy Council held 
its inaugural conference in 
the Rackham Amphitheatre, 
presenting the research club 
members conducted over the 
course of the semester to 30 
audience members. Students 
discussed 
the 
effects 
of 

government 
stability 
on 

humanitarian 
intervention, 

the 
success 
of 
antibiotic 

stewardship programs and 
the impacts of public opinion 
on the 2015 Paris climate 
agreement.

All of the research was 

published in a new academic 
journal 
titled 
Michigan 

Foreign Policy Review.

LSA 
senior 
Evan 
Viau, 

club president and founder, 
said he was impressed with 
the club members’ research 
throughout 
the 
semester 

and how they were able to 
put it together for this final 
presentation.

“I couldn’t be more proud 

of everyone,” Viau said. “This 
being our first semester, there 
were a lot of roadblocks. The 
level of work that we were able 
to put in our first semester 
and the level of work that our 
first and second year students 
were able to achieve — I’m 
impressed, I’m floored.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicole 

Dean, 
who 
studied 
the 

effectiveness 
of 
antibiotic 

stewardship 
programs, 

echoed Viau’s statement.

“It felt really good to show 

everyone how much work we 
put into this research,” she 
said. “I was excited to share it 
with everyone else.”

Dean’s research revolved 

around 
finding 
the 
best 

approach to the health issues 
caused 
by 
antimicrobial 

resistance 
when 
microbes 

resist medications previously 
used to treat them. She and 
her fellow group members 
explored 
how 
the 
rates 

of 
AMR 
changed 
when 

stewardship programs were 
implemented.

Despite the positive end 

product of the research, LSA 
freshman Daniel Evans, who 
looked at public opinion’s 
impact on the Paris climate 

agreement, said there were 
some challenges.

“It 
was 
very 
time 

intensive,” he said. “Given 
that it’s my first semester 
here, it’s my first exposure 
to more rigorous research, 
which I think is fun and 
rewarding, but it definitely 
took some time.”

Viau also noted he was 

The Michigan football team 

is headed to a New Year’s Six 
bowl — just not one it was 
hoping for a couple of weeks 
ago.

The 
Wolverines 
(7-2 
Big 

Ten, 10-2 overall), ranked sixth 
in the final College Football 
Playoff 
rankings 
released 

Sunday, announced today that 
they have accepted a bid to play 
in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 30 
in Miami Gardens, Fla. They 
will play their 45th all-time 
bowl game against Florida State 
(5-3 Atlantic Coast Conference, 
9-3 overall).

Michigan, ranked in the top 

four for most of the season, fell 
in the CFP rankings last week 
after losing at Ohio State on 
Nov. 26. Without a game this 
weekend, the Wolverines stayed 
on the outside of the playoff 
as other teams secured their 
spots. No. 1 and Southeastern 
Conference champion Alabama 
will play No. 4 and Pac-12 
champion Washington, and No. 
2 and ACC champion Clemson 
will play No. 3 Ohio State.

Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein, the first blind justice to ever serve on the court, presents on the value of inclusion at Michigan Hillel Sunday.

Richard Bernstein, Michigan 

Supreme Court justice, spoke 
on the importance of inclusion 
Sunday at the University of 
Michigan Hillel as part of the 
University’s 
Diversity, 
Equity 

and Inclusion initiative, a long-
term plan for increasing equity 
and inclusivity at the University.

Bernstein 
graduated 
from 

the University in 1996 and 
earned his law degree from 
Northwestern 
University’s 

School of Law. He practiced 
law alongside his brother Mark 
Bernstein — a University regent 

— and the rest of his family at 
The Sam Bernstein Law Firm 
until his election to the Michigan 
Supreme Court in 2014.

LSA 
junior 
Sarah 
Parkes, 

Hillel’s 
social 
action 
cohort 

chair, said she invited Bernstein, 
who has been blind since birth, to 
speak because she felt his voice 
was one the community needed 

to hear.

“We 
are 
an 
inclusive 

environment (where) everyone 
should feel comfortable and we 
feel like he has a lot to say about 
that,” Parkes said. “We’re having 
a tumultuous time on campus 
right now, and we’re looking for a 
way to promote inclusivity and a

A federal judge has recently 

mandated that the state of Michigan 

deliver weekly supplies of 395,000 

cases of water to Flint until its 

water crisis is resolved, denying a 

request for the state to put an earlier 

requirement to deliver water on hold.

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, U.S. District Judge David 

Lawson declared Flint water to still 

be unsafe and demanded the state 

give out water bottles to households 

without maintained filters Friday, 

a follow up on a initial order to 

do so last month after the state 

challenged it. The cost of the process 

is estimated to be $10.5 million per 

month.

For multiple months, Flint 

water was contaminated with 

lead, sparking significant health 

concerns for residents and gaining 

national attention, after the city’s 

water source was changed to the 

Flint River without the proper anti-

corrosive treatments.

This practice tainted the water 

supply with large amounts of lead 

from the pipes. It has been linked to 

medical issues including severe bone 

pain, tooth damage and cancer in 

Flint residents, especially affecting 

children.

Flint has also had a tumultuous 

relationship with the state this year. 

The state banned Flint from being 

able to sue on the crisis, fearing the 

lawsuit could take a toll on the state 

budget and create more conflict.

In their objection to the 

mandate on providing water, 

Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri 

and the state-appointed Flint 

Receivership Transition Advisory 

Board argued the ruling was not 

realistic and too expensive. They 

added that water bottles are already 

available to families in distribution 

centers.

Anna Heaton, spokeswoman 

for Gov. Rick Snyder, also said the 

process would make it difficult for 

Michigan to focus on improving 

the lead pipes and reducing home 

water use.

Lawson said Flint students still 

needed help despite the state’s plans, 

and Michigan must file a progress 

report by Dec. 16.

“Flint residents continue to 

suffer irreparable harm from 

a lack of reliable access to safe 

drinking water,” Lawson said in 

his ruling. “This is more than a 

mere inconvenience; hunting for 

water has become a dominant 

activity in some residents’ lives, 

causing anxiety, stress and financial 

hardship.”

According to The Wall Street 

Journal, Lawson said the state 

should first verify filters in houses, 

noting the process would take less 

than $1 million.

In research released Friday, 

Virginia Tech Prof. Marc Edwards 

noted several improvements in Flint’s 

water supply. Edwards was one of the 

main researchers during the start of 

the Flint water crisis, after receiving 

a request from residents who 

noticed the poor water quality and 

the increasing prevalence of illness 

among children. 

“Citizen-led testing shows water 

conditions continue to improve,” 

Edwards said during his press 

conference. “Lead and iron levels in 

the water are decreasing, with many 

more homes having non-detectable 

levels at the tap. However, he also 

said residents should continue to use 

bottled water and lead filters until 

otherwise notified by the EPA or 

the state.”

The 
Islamic 
Center 
of 

Ann Arbor received an anti-
Muslim letter last Wednesday, 
referring 
to 
Muslims 
as 

“children 
of 
Satan” 
and 

President-elect Donald Trump 
as the “new sheriff in town” 
who will “cleanse America.”

The same letter has been 

sent to mosques in California, 
Indiana, 
Rhode 
Island, 

Georgia, Ohio and Colorado, 
according to the Detroit Free 
Press. 
In 
Michigan, 
East 

Lansing’s mosque has also 
received a letter.

According to the Council on 

American-Islamic 
Relations’ 

Twitter account, the letters are 
under federal investigation, 
and it is currently unknown 
who is sending them. The group 

refers to itself as “Americans 
for a Better Way.”

The letter contained anti-

Islamic 
sentiment, 
calling 

Muslims “a vile and filthy 
people” and suggesting they 
“pack (their) bags and get out of 
Dodge.” The author also drew 
parallels to the Holocaust, 
stating Trump is “going to 
cleanse America and make it 
shine again. He is going to do 
to you what Hitler did to the 
Jews.”

The author also expressed 

his support for Trump, noting 
that “this is a great time for 
patriotic Americans. Long live 
President Trump.”

Trump’s campaign rhetoric 

sparked controversy on several 
topics, including his stance 
on Muslim immigration. His 
website called for “a total and 
complete shutdown of Muslims 
entering the United States until 

our country’s representatives 
can figure out what is going 
on,” attributing the cause to 
“major Islamic attacks” that 
he 
claims 
were 
conducted 

by 
children 
of 
Muslim 

immigrants. This claim has not 
been substantiated. 

Following 
the 
election 

results, 
a 
series 
of 
crime 

alerts for hate crimes near 
the University of Michigan’s 
campus 
has 
occurred, 

including 
one 
targeting 
a 

Muslim student. On the Friday 
following 
Trump’s 
win, 
a 

female Muslim student was 
approached by a man who 
demanded she take off her 
hijab, threatening to light her 
on fire if she refused. A few 
days 
later, 
another 
female 

student 
was 
pushed 
down 

a hill after being ethnically 
intimidated on campus.

Other similar incidents have 
also occurred that were not 
sent out as crime alerts, 
including one in which 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

found swastikas drawn on 
his door and another in 
which four men assaulted a 
University lecturer.

Sixty-three percent of 

Muslim students on campus 
have reported experiencing 
discrimination 
based 
on 

their 
race 
or 
religion, 

according 
to 
the 

University’s Islamophobia 
Working Group. LSA junior 
Haleemah Aqel, who is 
involved in the group, said 
she felt both sadness and 
resignation in regards to 
these incidents. 

“It’s sad to say I am not 

surprised that happened 
because of the climate not 
only on campus but in the 
U.S.,” she said. “Xenophobia 
is such a prevalent issue in 
our society. These instances 
are so ‘Wow I can’t believe 
this,’ but at the same time 
I can. It was bound to 
happen.”

entrepreneurship programs — 
said the creation of a minor in 
entrepreneurship, 
which 
was 

founded in winter 2014, has 
empowered students from all 
academic backgrounds to learn 
about starting small businesses.

“Since the introduction of the 

campus-wide minor, students 
from all schools and colleges can 
access new hands-on courses, 
creating 
more 
opportunities 

to connect, network and build 
successful 
entrepreneurial 

teams pulling from a variety of 
disciplines,” Ybarra said in a 
press release. “The University 
embraces entrepreneurship from 
all angles because the greater 
diversity in programming and 
disciplines in entrepreneurship, 
the greater UM’s contributions 
can be to the state and to the 
nation.”

In addition to the academic 

resources, 
many 
students, 

including 
Business 
junior 

Erin Johnson, the president 
of OptiMize, cited community 
engagement 
in 
student-led 

entrepreneurship organizations 
— which are a significant part of 
The Princeton Review’s ranking 
methodology — as valuable to 
the 
development 
of 
student 

innovations.

OptiMize is a community for 

students to help address social 
issues through entrepreneurial 
ventures, Johnson said. The 

program 
offers 
mentorship 

opportunities with community 
business 
leaders, 
student-

led 
discussion 
groups 
and 

workshops.

“Mentorship and the massive 

alumni 
network 
are 
very 

important to us,” Johnson said. 
“For our mentorship programs, 
the people who collaborate with 
OptiMize groups tend to be local 
business leaders and alumni who 
want to help. Some of our best 

resources come from an array 
of sources. For example, we 
have worked with people from 
Zingerman’s to teach us vision 
and leadership skills. But what 
is probably the best thing about 
being in the area and having 
access to the alumni network 
is that if you are interested in 
something, there’s a good chance 
that someone from Michigan has 
been involved in that field.”

One such connection, Johnson 

said, 
was 
the 
Detroit-based 

Michigan 
Urban 
Farming 

Initiative. 
The 
initiative, 

which was started by former 
OptiMize members, works to 
provide Detroit locals with fresh 
produce to address the problems 
associated 
with 
urban 
food 

deserts.

“Just last week, the team 

received $2 million of funding 
for an ‘agrihood,’ which is 
essentially an urban farm in a 
Detroit neighborhood — the first 
of its kind in America,” Johnson 
said.

The success of the Michigan 

Urban 
Farming 
Initiative, 

she added, also points to the 
potential for student success 
in entrepreneurship from the 
University.

“It’s cool because they, like 

every other OptiMize group, 
began 
with 
two-to-three 

thousand dollars in funding, and 
now they are receiving millions 
of dollars to continue the work 
that they began here at the 
University,” Johnson said. “And 
that, to me, is the most inspiring 
part of OptiMize — that it’s not 
just something that happens 
when you’re at the University, 
it’s something that you start here 
and use to start to build your 
lives.”

Business 
junior 
Danny 

Sheridan said he had experienced 
academic and community support 
with his own entrepreneurial 
venture, Woodside Distributors, 
which is a national distribution 
company for home improvement, 
automotive, sporting and other 
goods.

“The way that I was able 

to best take advantage of the 
entrepreneurial 
opportunities 

during my time here has not 
really been through the classes 
but by meeting with the people 
that are here,” Sheridan said. 
“It was by meeting with faculty 
and other students and having 
engaging conversations about 
our interests, and going from 

there.”

In April, Sheridan and his 

business partners won “The 

Startup,” a University-sponsored 
competition funded and run by 
the Center for Entrepreneurship. 
The CFE, which was created 
in 2008, began as an initiative 
at the College of Engineering, 
but has since expanded to offer 
entrepreneurship education for 
students in all colleges.

The Woodside Distributors 

team took home a grand prize of 
$15,000, which Sheridan used to 
help the company’s growth.

“That money helped us hire 

staff,” Sheridan said. “Now we 
have a team of 12 people, and has 
enabled us to de-risk some of our 
startup capital. And I think that 
the 12 University of Michigan 
students who have jobs would be 

very appreciative of that money.”

Over time, Sheridan said, 

this money has also enabled 
significant growth. From 2015 
to 2016, Woodside Distributors 
financially grew from $2 million 
to $3.5 million.

However, it was not just the 

University’s 
participation 
in 

entrepreneurship that enabled 
Woodside 
Distributors 
to 

succeed. Sheridan said support 
from the Ann Arbor business 
community proved to be among 
the 
greatest 
assets 
in 
the 

development of their business 
model.

Through Sheridan’s mentor, 

Adrian Fortino, a partner at the 
Mercury Fund, a venture capital 
firm in based out of Texas with 
offices in Ann Arbor, the team at 
Woodside Distributors was able 
to meet with people at Nutshell, a 
customer resource management 
firm, and learn from experts in 
their field.

“The people at Nutshell taught 

us how to use their software, 
which would have probably cost 
a lot for other people, but because 
we are Michigan students, it was 
no big deal; Adrian Fortino was 
able to hook us up,” Sheridan 
said.

way to overcome adversity. I 
think that it’ll be great for our 
community to have a different 
lens.”

Much of Bernstein’s talk 

was made up of anecdotes 
from his own experiences with 
overcoming the adversity he 
faced being blind in pursuit of 
inclusion. Despite his disability, 
he successfully completed 20 
marathons and a full Ironman, 
which is a triathlon composed 
of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile 
bicycle ride and a marathon 
26.2-mile run.

He also spoke on his long 

recovery after a severe accident 
in Central Park when he was 
hit by a biker while walking 
unassisted along a path he 
had memorized. During the 10 
weeks he spent recovering in the 
hospital, he learned to appreciate 
even accomplishments as small 
as being able to sit up in bed.

“In life, it’s those simple 

things that people desperately 
want, 
that 
others 
don’t 

appreciate,” Bernstein said. “As 
you all go through your lives, 
I would ask you to celebrate 
every 
accomplishment 
you 

have, no matter how small and 
insignificant you think it is.”

He also emphasized how 

being a justice on the Supreme 
Court tied back to these ideals.

Bernstein described his job 

as a justice as a rewarding but 
intense one, because in most 
of the cases the court sees, 

they are deciding whether the 
defendants should face life in 
prison.

“The 
intensity 
is 
quite 

massive, because the stakes 
are incredibly high,” Bernstein 
said. “Literally nothing less 
than a person’s life hangs in the 
balance. Whatever our report 
decides will be the outcome of 
this person’s life.”

As a blind justice, Bernstein 

faces an extra stressor — he must 
memorize all 26 cases that come 
before the court each week.

“You have to be familiar 

with the transcripts, and the 
transcripts 
are 
voluminous,” 

Bernstein said. “(Reading them 
in braille) would be simply 
impossible. Using a computer is 
also ineffective because if you 
wear an earpiece, you are not 
relevant in the conversation. 
You have to be focused on what 
is happening. The only option 
for me is to memorize all the 
cases.”

Bringing 
the 
conversation 

back to inclusion, Bernstein 
told the audience that his 
differences, and those of each 
justice, are what make them so 
effective as a body.

“If you have seven people 

sitting around the room … 
that are all from the same 
background, then voices are 
going to be lost,” he said. “But 
if you have people that are 
different, it allows you to look 
at things in a different light. 
You create a perspective that 
otherwise wasn’t there.”

The 
event 
drew 
a 
wide 

range of people, from both the 
Hillel community and from the 

greater University. LSA juniors 
Halimat Olaniyan and Yuchen 
Luo, who recently started a 
student organization to promote 
disability services and studies, 
said they were excited to hear 
Bernstein’s thoughts on the 
subject.

“There’s racism and there’s 

sexism, 
but 
there’s 
also 

ableism, and people don’t talk 
about that a lot,” Olaniyan said. 
“A lot of the words we use are 
ableist … things that we don’t 
think about, like ‘lame’ or ‘I’m 
so ADHD,’ that affect someone 
who 
has 
that 
(disability), 

and we just want to spread 
awareness.”

Other students were drawn to 

the event because of Bernstein’s 
story. 
LSA 
freshman 
Sam 

Kole said he felt inspired by 
Bernstein’s passion and drive.

“He 
didn’t 
let 
anything 

hold him back,” Kole said. “He 
pushed the status quo and really 
became a champion for people 
with disabilities, and rose to 
the highest levels of our state 
government. I’m here to hear 
about his fiery passion that led 
him through diversity and to the 
top.”

Bernstein 
concluded 
his 

speech by talking about a 
project he’s working on to 
integrate disabled citizens into 
the Israeli Defense Force, which 
has become a law in Israel.

“This 
is 
how 
change 

happens,” he said. “We’ve been 
working on this for five or six 
years … Change comes in very 
slow, methodical steps, but if 
you don’t give up on it, that kind 
of change is real.”

Penn State came back to beat

The Orange Bowl is the 

Wolverines’ 
highest-caliber 

postseason destination since 
they made the Sugar Bowl at 
10-2 in 2011. They should be the 
favorite, too, against a Seminoles 
team with three losses in its 
conference. 
Michigan 
has 

played in the Orange Bowl just 

twice before, most recently 
beating Alabama in overtime on 
Jan. 1, 2000, with quarterback 
Tom Brady.

But heading into November, 

Michigan

disappointed with the low 
turnout at the event.

“I would’ve hoped for a 

few more people,” he said. 
“One of the things as a new 
student org that is one of the 
biggest challenges is kind of 
gaining credibility and a voice 
on campus. Leveraging social 
media and all that is going to 
take some time to build up so 
we’ll see how that goes.”

LSA sophomore Sara Bruce 

said moving forward, some 
of the club members hope to 
expand on the research that 
they presented during the 
conference.

“In the future, what we’re 

going to hope to do is write 
policy proposals based on our 

research,” she said. “Since it 
is our first semester, we had 
a limited amount of time, 
but in the future, we’d like to 
take our research and make 
suggestions to sort of solve the 
problems.”

Regarding his own research, 

Evans said he hopes it helps 
inform people about the Paris 

climate agreement.

“I’d like to see it be read by 

more people and perhaps see 
other people improve upon it 
because Paris is a recent event 
so there’s lots to uncover,” he 
said.

Though he acknowledged 

the club has room to grow, 
Viau emphasized that he felt 
proud about the progress his 
team members have made so 
far.

“When I first had this idea 

last fall, I didn’t imagine we’d 
be packing people into a room 
on a Sunday right before finals 
to talk about foreign policy,” 
Viau said. “I was always 
cautious and hopeful, and to 
see that people have coalesced 
around this and that it will 
continue 
next 
semester, 
I 

couldn’t be more proud or be 
more happy.”

and an active role in shaping its 
future.

“Adient’s decision to locate 

its operational headquarters 
in Detroit is both strategic and 
symbolic,” the press release 
read. “We welcome Adient 
and appreciate their long-term 
commitment to the economic 
viability of Detroit and to being 
a key player in the automotive 
industry in Michigan.”

Adient is already involved 

in several other areas of 
Michigan. It currently has 
research 
and 
development 

operations 
in 
Plymouth 

and serves as the corporate 
sponsor of one University 
of Michigan undergraduate 
design project for a upcoming 
multidisciplinary 
design 

expo.

The 
team, 
composed 
of 

four mechanical engineering 
students, will work with Adient 
to design a mechanical closure 
for an automotive seat track. 
Engineering 
senior 
Mallik 

Guduguntla, a member of the 
team, said he thinks the inflow 
of companies into Detroit and 
Michigan in general provides 
a strong boost in development 
efforts and ability to grow.

“I’m really glad companies 

are 
continuing 
to 
invest 

and grow Detroit into the 
powerful city it once was,” 
he said. “Bringing corporate 

headquarters and jobs back 
to 
Detroit 
will 
improve 

infrastructure, restaurants and 
residential options. Entering 
college five years ago, I never 
thought of living in Detroit but 
now it may be happening.”

Due to its choice to move 

to Detroit, the company will 
receive 
about 
$2 
million 

from the Michigan Business 
Development 
Program 
to 

invest in new job creation. The 
MBDP is part of the Michigan 
Economic 
Development 

Corporation, which provides 
grants or loans to businesses for 
projects that will generate new 
jobs or investment.

Adient’s operation in Detroit 

is expected to earn the city 
approximately 
$17.2 
million 

in net income and property 
tax over the next 12 years. The 
company will be the fourth 
Fortune 500 company to have 
their headquarters located in 
the city, and is the first to move 
into Detroit since 2003.

The seating supply company 

evaluated 40 different locations 
in and outside of Michigan 
before choosing to settle in 
Detroit. Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan noted in a press release 
that this decision indicates 
a positive trend in economic 
growth due to the influx of 
businesses.

“Adient’s decision to choose 

Detroit from among a large field 
of competitors to base its global 
headquarters is another major 
vote of confidence in where we 
are headed as a city,” he said.

horizon 
(noun): 

the point in space where 
gravity is so great, not 

even light can escape. Meaningful 
differences 
still 
exist 
beyond 

the event horizon, but due to a 
massive gravitational pull, an 
outside observer can’t 
differentiate 
between 

any 
objects 
after 

that point.

I recently watched 

a rough cut of a 
documentary 
about 

Michigan 
football 

that contains a scene 
of a group of students 
protesting 
Trump’s 

election. They hold 
signs declaring Trump 
a racist. A man approaches them 
and asks them to name Trump’s 
sins. The first sin that comes out 
of a protester’s mouth is Trump’s 
utterance of “bad hombres.” 
The protesters go on to point 
out Trump’s derisive comments 
about Mexicans, and the man 
retorts that Trump doesn’t want 
to ban Mexicans, but wants to 
crackdown on “illegals.”

This scene demonstrates that 

Trump has reached his own 
event horizon. He has become 
such a toxic figure that liberals 
don’t differentiate between his 
“less terrible” offenses and his 
egregious 
ones. 
Additionally, 

liberals have come to associate 
his 
singularly 
destructive 

personality so closely with his 
policies that those policies are 
no longer given due, critical 
examination. I don’t mean this as 
a criticism of these protesters, in 
particular; if someone put me on 
the spot, I would also likely have 
trouble coming up with specific 
examples of Trump’s racism. 
Rather, I blame liberal discourse, 
which has ineffectively separated 
the bad and the ugly.

Consider The New York Times’ 

collection 
of 
insults 
Trump 

has hurled on Twitter since he 
announced his presidential bid. 
Its 
presentation 
is 
brutalist, 

and displays columns of insults 
with no aesthetic goal other 
than to inspire shock and awe. 
The 
complete 
collection 
is 

77 pages printed out. There’s 
certainly value in having such 
a resource, and I don’t want 

to argue that we shouldn’t pay 
attention to Trump’s Twitter 
account. His online presence has 
allowed him to circumvent the 
press and agenda-set without 
traditional journalistic scrutiny. 
We can’t understand Trump’s 

character or goals as 
a politician without 
understanding 
his 

Twitter.

But the list elides 

his greater offenses. 
His imitation of a 
disabled 
New 
York 

Times reporter, his 
assertion that John 
McCain isn’t a war 
hero because he was 
captured, his brags 

about grabbing girls by the pussy 
and his lie that Arabs celebrated 
the destruction of the World Trade 
Center — these are indefensible. 
His claim that Judge Gonzalo 
Curiel couldn’t fairly adjudicate 
a case against Trump due to 
Curiel’s Mexican heritage drew 
condemnation across the political 
spectrum. Republican Speaker of 
the House Paul Ryan went as far 
as to say, “Claiming a person can’t 
do their job because of their race is 
sort of like the textbook definition 
of a racist comment.”

By allowing statements like 

these to lose saliency, liberal 
discourse has enabled people 
to 
forget 
Trump’s 
highlight 

reel. Liberals have to hold these 
egregious statements close to 
our minds and be ready to deploy 
them when someone asks what 
makes Trump a racist. While 
liberals like myself may find 
statements he’s made about “bad 
hombres” offensive, I don’t think 
they compare to his comments on 
Judge Curiel. As demonstrated 
in the scene above, Trump’s 
supporters can easily interpret 
his 
comments 
about 
“bad 

hombres” as referring specifically 
to undocumented immigrants. It’s 
not that drawing attention to his 
“lesser offenses” isn’t important; 
we need to catalogue every 
instance of Trump’s hate. But by 
focusing on his unequivocally vile 
ones, we can begin to shift our 
citizenry’s understanding of him. 
As I’ve written in the past, I don’t 
think most Trump supporters 
are white supremacists. Rather, 

they are complicit in advancing 
racism. If liberals had done a 
better job of keeping Trump’s 
clear-cut hatred at the forefront 
of our national dialogue, maybe 
the election would have turned 
out differently.

Because so much of his 

rhetoric goes beyond the pale, 
people have also lost the ability 
to critically analyze his policy 
proposals. Ask yourself: Why 
is his plan to build a wall so 
much more unpalatable than 
other hardline approaches to 
immigration? 
It’s 
expensive, 

but so is hiring thousands more 
border 
patrol 
officers. 
And 

perhaps the wall would reify 
American prejudice and damage 
Mexican-American relations. But 
beyond those two arguments, I 
can’t think of many more issues 
with the wall.

Public knowledge of critiques 

of his policies is similarly one-
dimensional. For instance, in a 
speech castigating Trump, Mitt 
Romney suggested that his trade 
policies would start a trade war 
with China, and quickly moved on 
to another criticism. It’s not enough 
to just say Trump will instigate a 
trade war with China. What will 
this trade war look like? What 
effects will it have on American 
consumers and manufacturers? 
What about our foreign relations? 
This lack of public understanding 
is obviously coupled with the fact 
that 
candidates’ 
personalities, 

rather than substantial policy 
discussion, drove this past election. 
But going forward, liberals need to 
do our homework on why Trump’s 
policies will be so disastrous.

One 
oft-repeated 
prognosis 

of the election has been that the 
media took Trump literally but 
not seriously, while his supporters 
took him seriously but not literally. 
Now that he’s president-elect, we 
have to take him both seriously 
and literally. By writing about his 
policies with proper rigor and not 
permitting his most despicable 
moments to be forgotten, resistance 
against Trump can broaden our 
country’s understanding of both 
his ineptitude and toxicity.

P

in drop silence.

I cradled myself as I 

watched CNN Political 

Commentator Van Jones ask 
America: “How will we explain 
this to our children?”

In the cold of this November 

night, the only warmth I felt was 
from the tears rolling down my 
face. I thought, how did we get 
here? I closed my eyes and took 
in the stillness of that moment.

Pin drop silence.
That was my answer.
My parents immigrated to this 

country from Pakistan in the late 
’80s, hoping to start a family with 
a bright future. They embraced 
my 
brown 
skin 
with 
love, 

looked into my dark eyes with 
hope, smiling into the nursery 
filled with children of all colors 
knowing that we would grow up 
to have the same opportunities.

I thought about my childhood. 

I am American. Born and raised. 
I played tag on our playgrounds, 
bench-warmed on our sports 
teams and looked around the 
classroom and thought, these are 
my friends.

But I was conditioned from a 

young age to conform.

“You’re a terrorist.”
“You can’t do that, you’re a 

girl.”

“Go back to your country.”
I always brushed off little 

comments like that. Growing up, 
I was never at a loss for words. 
I smiled and laughed, although 

each slur silently hit at the core of 
my identity, slowly dismantling 
my self-esteem, instilling fear 
into every fiber of my being.

My mind would run a million 

miles, but my mouth would stay 
shut. I thought, there is no point 
in sharing my opinion because 
no one will listen and no one will 
change their mind. Why should 
I fight back when everyone will 
look down on me?

This is my America, too, 

but I never felt welcomed in 
it. I convinced myself that if I 
never stated my discomfort, it 
wouldn’t be real. In my naive 
desire to fit in, I would spend 
years holding my tongue.

If I were a parent today, I 

would not be able to look into 
my child’s eyes the same way my 
parents did with hope. Instead, 
I would apologize. Apologize 
for bringing them into a nation 
where they will meet hatred 
for their identity. Apologize 
for passing on the feeling of 
isolation. 
Apologize 
for 
my 

years of silence that put them in 
this position.

To the people who once 

pointed their fingers at me for 
being different: I want to point 
back at you and say the state of 
our nation is your fault. I woke 
up disillusioned in President-
elect Donald Trump’s America 
because of you. You, parading 
around with your misogyny, 
racism and xenophobia like a 
badge of honor. This is your 
fault.

But I can’t point at you.
It’s me too. I have always had 

a voice and I made the conscious 
decision to remain silent. I 
cannot resent you because it’s 
my fault you don’t understand. 
I never gave you the chance to 
understand how it feels to be 
a person of color in America. 
I never explained the subtle 
discrimination I face that makes 
my skin itch. I never told you 
what you said to me was wrong. 
How could you know?

I grew up with you, I went to 

school with you and I brushed 
off your comments, thinking 
you still saw me as an equal. 
But you support someone who 
wants to ban me. I have spent 
my whole life staying silent out 
of fear of becoming an outsider, 
but this election has shown that 
I have been one all along.

I have spent years being 

silent, but I will be silent no 
more.

I will be loud for Latinos, 

Muslims, Black people, disabled 
people, war veterans and others 
he demonized and attacked.

They want us to stay silent, 

but this is no time to concede. 
This election shows that the 
fight is far from over. Our 
nation needs us more than ever. 
We must stand up. We must 
persevere. We must speak out.

The case against an election recount 

ROLAND DAVIDSON | COLUMN

T

he 
Green 
Party 

presidential 
candidate 

Jill Stein filed for a 

recount in Pennsylvania, a state 
Hillary Clinton lost — which 
helped pave the way for Donald 
Trump’s election win. 
Imagine going back in 
time two months and 
telling yourself that 
sentence was true. I 
can’t fathom how that 
conversation 
would 

go, but today that is 
our reality. Auditing 
the 
vote 
translates 

into voter suppression 
policies and rhetoric, 
and 
searching 
for 

flaws in the electoral system does 
not have tangible benefits that 
outweigh this. However, because 
Stein called for the recount 
without 
Clinton’s 
consent, 

Clinton should play a role in 
the recount. 

Stein also recently filed for a 

recount in Michigan. The national 
call for it came after cybersecurity 
threats 
were 
identified 
by 

groups of computer scientists, 
including the director of the 
University of Michigan Center for 
Computer Security and Society, 
J. Alex Halderman. According 
to Halderman, a state voting 
infrastructure hack is a possibility, 
primarily 
in 
Pennsylvania, 

Wisconsin and Michigan. A hack 
in Michigan is feasible, though 
the risk seems to be lower due 
to the use of paper ballots. The 
probability of the cybersecurity 
threat is amplified by the Russian 
hacks of John Podesta and the 
Democratic National Committee 
this year, which identified a clear 
intent by a foreign actor to interfere 
with the election.

A recount would display any 

violation of the electoral process, 
but it will also cause voter 
suppression. 
The 
Democratic 

Party spent almost the entire 
length of the Clinton campaign 
defending the voting system. That 
defense was critical to stopping 
voter suppression, which is of 
increasing concern. 

This year was the first general 

election after a 2013 ruling that 
softened protections under the 
Voting Rights Act, resulting in 
14 states imposing new voting 
restrictions. That denies the 
right to vote to thousands of 
Americans, usually low-income 
and non-white individuals, from 
the electoral process. There is no 
rebutting that voter suppression 
impacts 
minority 
voters, 
as 

courts, numerous studies and 
Republican 
politicians 
have 

admitted 
to 
the 
effects 
of 

restrictions. Now, after months 
of defending the security of the 

voting system, Clinton is calling it 
into question. That poses a large 
problem.

For conservative politicians, 

voting 
security 
does 
not 

mean protection from cyber 

attacks. 
Rather, 

it 
translates 
into 

voter 
suppression 

through 
strict 

voting ID laws, felon 
disenfranchisement, 
mail-in 
ballot 

restrictions 
and 

early 
voting 

cutbacks. 
The 

Democratic 
Party 

needs to be working 
to stop suppression, 

and calling the integrity of the 
voting system into question 
does not do that. The best 
evidence for the jump between 
representing a vulnerable voting 
system and voter suppression 
comes 
from 
President-elect 

Trump himself. In response to 
the call for a recount, Trump 
falsely claimed he would have 
won the popular vote if it was 
not for millions of illegal votes. 
The potential threat of illegal 
votes is a primary driver of voter 
suppression policies.

The risk of voter suppression 

is large enough to outweigh the 
benefits of calling for a recount. 
Even Halderman admits that 
the probability of a hack is quite 
low. That low probability is 
outweighed by the high chances 
of voter suppression. I could 
be swayed to think otherwise 
if I heard a more compelling 
justification for a recount. A 
Michigan recount will not win 
Clinton the vote, but this doesn’t 
seem to be the main goal of most 
recount 
proponents. 
Rather, 

the main benefit to citizens of 
Michigan seems to be only for 
those who want to verify that 
there was not a hack. “Just 
trying to be sure” is not a valid 
enough benefit to risk justifying 
voter suppression in tons of 
states. Democrats should be 
building public confidence in 
elections by pushing for policies 
that protect voter rights, not by 
pushing for an audit.

The best case for a recount 

I have seen comes from a 
Vox editorial that argues the 
reverse of my argument, that 
normalizing 
recounts 
would 

increase public confidence in 
elections. The piece argues that 
if recounts always happened 
then it “won’t give credence to 
conspiracy theorists, and it will 
bolster rather than undermine 
public confidence.” That said, 
think of all the damage that 
normalized recounts could do.

Take, 
for 
example, 
the 

governor’s race in North Carolina, 
which still has not been officially 
called. 
Democratic 
nominee 

Attorney General Roy Cooper 
has unofficially received 9,700 
more ballots than incumbent 
Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. 
McCrory has refused to concede 
the election in an attempt to 
hold onto his governor seat. 
Furthermore, McCrory called for 
a recount in several counties with 
no evidence of foul play. McCrory 
has brought the efficacy of North 
Carolina’s election into play, and 
there will be negative impacts.

The North Carolina recount is 

clearly a last-ditch attempt to hold 
onto power by a politician who is 
basing his strategy in allegations. 
However, breaking down the 
public confidence of the North 
Carolina election is going to have 
a negative consequence: voter 
suppression. One justification for 
the North Carolina recount has 
come after widespread claims 
of voter fraud from McCrory’s 
campaign. There is no evidence 
for this accusation, but it manifests 
itself in voter suppression policy. 
The incumbent’s campaign is 
using voter fraud as a basis for 
a lawsuit to not count same-day 
registration ballots in the election. 
 

North Carolina displays what 

happens when claims for recounts 
go haywire. Politicians refusing 
to 
concede 
elections, 
false 

evidence of voter fraud and voter 
suppression come as the result 
of dismantling public confidence 
in the electoral process. Now 
imagine if recounts were a norm 
and happened all the time. The 
chances 
that 
these 
recounts 

would resemble North Carolina’s 
would increase exponentially.

However, I will not condemn 

Clinton for participating in the 
recount. Stein calling for the 
audit meant that a recount was 
going to happen with or without 
Clinton, making any risk of 
dismantling public confidence in 
the electoral process inevitable. 
Therefore, Clinton is not directly 
at fault for any voter suppression 
that the recount creates. It is also 
difficult to blame a politician 
who simply wishes to ensure an 
inescapable recount was going 
to occur properly. While Clinton 
may not be directly to blame, this 
problem highlights a necessity 
for policy that fights back against 
voter suppression. The United 
States needs public confidence 
in elections, and the best way to 
accomplish this is by increasing 
the 
protections 
originally 

granted by the Voting Rights Act.

20TH CENTURY FOX

There’s Something About Mountain Dew.

Has there ever been a Broadway 

musical as big as “Hamilton?” 
It seems like every time I write 
about the show, I ask myself that 
question. I’ve never seen anything 
from 
the 
stage 

capture the cultural 
zeitgeist in such a 
big way.

The 
latest 

iteration 
of 
this 

impact 
is 
The 

Hamilton Mixtape, 
an album of covers 
and 
spinoffs 
of 

songs in the show. 
The list of artists 
who 
lent 
their 

voices is impressive: Usher, Kelly 
Clarkson, Regina Spektor, Sia, 
John 
Legend, 
Common 
and 

Jimmy Fallon, to name a few. But, 
given how much I love the musical 
and some of these performers, 
I was surprised by how many 
problems 
there 
are 
on 
The 

Mixtape. A lot of the spinoffs and a 
few of the covers are brilliant and 
will be songs I listen to regularly, 
but some feel uninspired and drag 
down the album as a result.

The 
biggest 
problem 
with 

The Hamilton Mixtape comes 
from some of the covers’ lack 
of 
emotional 
depth. 
There 

are 
undoubtedly 
some 
good 

reimaginings of songs on the 
album, but others lack the power 
that the theatrical performers 
brought to them.

Take “Satisfied” for example. 

In the show, that song represents 
a moment of anguish for Angelica 
Schuyler. She’s watching her sister 
marry the only man she’s ever had 
a connection with. She sings about 
how she loves Alexander, but 
ultimately loves her sister more. 
The song is one of the emotional 
gut punches of the musical and 
is ultimately why Renée Elise 
Goldsberry won the Tony for 

Featured Actress in a Musical this 
year. Those are almost impossible 
shoes to fill, but Sia doesn’t even 
come close. Her rendition lacks 
even a fraction of Goldsberry’s 
depth. It sounds like she’s just 
singing the song, not performing 
it and giving it everything she 
can. And, ultimately, that’s why it 

suffers.

That’s not the 

only 
cover 
that 

needs just a little 
more 
from 
the 

singers. 
Usher’s 

“Wait for It,” a 
track that gives 
depth to the Aaron 
Burr character, left 
me feeling empty 
inside. 
Ashanti’s 

“Helpless” didn’t 

seem to have any of the hopeful 
optimism and innocence the song 
requires. Plus, Ja Rule’s version 
of Alexander’s verse is painful 
because of how he whines his way 
through it. Also, I don’t know what 
the dialogue opening of Jimmy 
Fallon’s “You’ll be Back” is, but it’s 
not funny in the slightest.

Yet, a few of the covers stick 

out above the rest because of how 
fresh and new they feel. “Dear 
Theodosia” is one of the most 
beautiful songs in “Hamilton,” 
and the song’s simple piano-based 
nature fits Regina Spektor’s voice 
perfectly. Spektor and Ben Folds 
don’t try to do too much, and just 
let the song’s beauty stand on its 
own. Also, Kelly Clarkson’s cover 
of “It’s Quiet Uptown,” another 
one of the musical’s emotional 
gut-punches, nearly moved me 
to tears the first time I heard 
it. In her voice, I felt the pain of 
what losing a child is like. John 
Legend’s “History Has Its Eyes 
on You” doesn’t have much lyrical 
depth (as the song in the musical is 
very short), but it’s another perfect 
match of singer and song.

Where 
The 
Mixtape 
truly 

shined was in its spinoffs. In some 
cases, 
composer 
Lin-Manuel 

Miranda and the artists took a line 
or two from a song and made it 
their own. My favorite is probably 
“Wrote My Way Out.” The third 
track of the album takes two lines 
from “Hurricane” and spins them 
off into a hook that’s as powerful 
as it is catchy. The verses by Nas, 
Dave East and Miranda each 
have statements about what it’s 
like to write your way out of a 
rough situation. Miranda’s verse 
is particularly strong. His lyrics 
have the momentum of a runaway 
freight train as he brings ideas 
of not fitting in with his peers at 
school, but still having the need to 
put his thoughts on pen and paper. 
There’s also “Say Yes to This,” 
which takes the song “Say No to 
This,” where Hamilton is trying 
and failing to oppose an affair 
with Mariah Reynolds, and turns 
it to Reynold’s perspective. Jill 
Scott’s sultry performance makes 
the song seductive, and it’s hard to 
resist falling for it.

There are also a couple of 

tracks where The Mixtape takes 
an existing song from “Hamilton” 
and puts it into a modern context. 
The most memorable example is 
“My Shot.” The hook is the same, 
but the verses by Black Thought, 
Joell Ortiz and Busta Rhymes 
put a modern spin on the words, 
updating them to talk about their 
perspective on what it’s like to 
grab “their shot.” Wiz Khalifa’s 
“Washingtons by Your Side” is 
less successful, but it passes very 
quickly, so it doesn’t leave a lasting 
negative impact.

I’m very surprised by how 

mixed my feelings were on The 
Hamilton Mixtape. Since seeing 
the show in August, I’ve fallen in 
love with the music, consuming 
every possible thing I can that’s 
related to the show. Before 
listening to the album, I didn’t 
think there would be anything 
“Hamilton”-related I wouldn’t 
enjoy. And, I really did love some 
of the tracks. Others just make me 
wish for something deeper.

ALBUM REVIEW

Telling a joke that gets the 

entire room laughing is the 
social equivalent of hitting a 
grand slam. Gazing around and 
seeing everyone’s brief joy feels 
so good that it bears repeating. 
Logically, if it’s funny once, it 
should at least be equally funny 
the second time. More is usually 
better, and more laughter is 
always 
better. 
Unfortunately, 

with every repeated attempt, 
the joke exponentially decays 
into the realm of pitiful comedy 
occupied by the likes of Dane 
Cook and Jeff Dunham.

There are few things more 

heartbreaking than witnessing 
someone ruin a perfectly good 
joke. The timing, context and 
delivery all felt so right before 
the overzealous jokester got 
carried away. This humiliating 
act is like watching a baseball 
player trip on home plate and 
break their femur after hitting 
the game-winning grand slam — 
it’s a tragicomedy.

Comedy 
ages 
the 
worst 

compared to all other movie 
genres. Its short shelf life is 
because of the fleeting nature of 
jokes; dated cultural references 
usually fail to align with newer 
audiences. It’s not that telling 
the same joke becomes repetitive 
and exhaustive. It’s that the 
jokes just aren’t as relevant to the 

modern world.

The 
cheesy 
and 
raunchy 

“There’s 
Something 
About 

Mary” was mostly well-received 
by audiences and critics after its 
1998 release. AFI would even go 
on to rank it the 27th funniest 
movie of the last 100 years, 
ahead of comedy behemoths 
like “Ghostbusters” and “Animal 
House.” Peculiarly, this “classic” 
has aged quite poorly since its 
release. Although the famous 
pant-zipper gag is punchy and 
funny, the excessive amount of 
jokes that make fun of people 
with disabilities are lazy and 
offensive. Laughing at the pain 
of others is still the standard 
for comedy, but in 2016, we 
don’t really laugh at autism and 
paralysis. It’s shocking to think 
this was ever widely accepted.

Challenging the norm is what 

makes comedy so gripping. By 
contesting a sensitive subject, 
comedians and movies can often 
bring light to a controversial 
issue. How this is done and who’s 
at the tail end of the joke, however, 
determines everything. Movies 
that satirize systems of higher 
authorities tend to age better 
than those that bully traditionally 
marginalized 
groups. 

Throughout time, there will 
always be something inherently 
wrong in the world that can be 
critiqued, like bad leadership and 
useless bureaucracies.

“Monty Python and the Holy 

Grail” has aged as gracefully as 

David Lynch’s glorious mane of 
gray hair. Every joke and scene is 
still as hilarious and brilliant as it 
was in 1975. There will never be a 
day where this movie is not funny. 
What sets it apart from other flops 
of this time is its ability to takes 
risks in the genre and experiment 
with basic storytelling elements, 
like conclusive endings and tidy 
plotlines. Considering the movie 
was a standalone and unique 
work, time does nothing but 
solidify its masterful quality.

Movies that were never lauded 

by critics, but adored by a cult 
following, like “Tim and Eric’s 
Billion Dollar Movie” generally 
age beautifully. However, they 
seldom break out into more 
widespread appreciation as time 
progresses. Movies that are so 
idiosyncratic only appeal to a 
specific group of people that 
adore all aspects of the movie; 
it’s unusual that this changes 
over time. With “Tim and Eric,” 
it’s nearly impossible that larger 
audiences will eventually grow to 
love the movie’s surreal and often 
grotesque moments that attract 
such a cult following.

Whether or not a movie will 

age well to the modern world is 
impossible to predict. Although 
an ingenious script and innovative 
storytelling don’t hurt, people’s 
tastes 
change 
unpredictably. 

Many people may find the 
classic “Doctor Strangelove” a 
bit slow today when compared to 
“Sausage Party.”

Someone has been drinking Mountain Dew... =]

On December 31, 2015, with 

about ten minutes left in a year 
that had graced us with the first 
great “Star Wars” movie since 
1983, I decided to do something 
I had never done before: I was 
going to make a New Year’s 
Resolution. I’d tried it before; 
I’d told myself that I was going 
to drink less Mountain Dew 
about 20 times, only to down my 
regular three cans the very next 
day. No, my resolution would 
have to be something measurable 
and absolute. With that in mind, 
I made my decision: if I saw a 
trailer in 2016, I would see the 
movie.

And so the madness began.
It started slowly enough. I saw 

a movie a week, marking down the 
trailers for future reference. By 
March, I was up to two movies a 
week, which increased to three by 
the time summer got underway. 
I had never been more broke. I 
would wake up the morning after 
with my eyes hurting. I ate so 
much popcorn it made me sick.

It was incredible.
It may sound obvious, but there 

are a lot of movies released in one 
year. “You idiot,” you’re probably 
thinking, “of course there are a 
lot of movies released in a year.” 
I knew this, but the reality of the 
situation didn’t really hit me until 

I realized that even at a rate of 
roughly twelve movies a month, I 
was still missing some.

What all this amounts to is 

that over Thanksgiving break, I 
saw my hundredth movie of the 
year. What all this means is that, 
despite my best efforts, I have 
learned some things.

The first thing was that a lot 

of great movies fly under the 
radar. To be clear, this isn’t me 
saying that all indie movies are 
the greatest things ever and any 
movie with a seven figure budget 
is a sign that film is dying. That’s 
bull. Several of my personal 
favorites from this year, like 
“Captain America: Civil War” or 
“Deadpool” are blockbusters that 
more than earn their hundreds of 
millions. However, some movies 
like David Mackenzie’s smart, 
intense, and surprisingly funny 
heist film “Hell or High Water” 
and Laika’s animated epic “Kubo 
and the Two Strings” barely 
manage to make their budgets 
back despite being some of the 
best that 2016 has to offer.

With that in mind and at the 

risk of sounding like a cynic, most 
movies are just average. I want to 
make it clear that of the 100-plus 
movies I’ve seen thus far, I’ve 
liked over half of them. It’s been a 
good year. I’ve seen far more great 
ones than I have awful ones. Still, 
I’ve found at least one in every 
three films fit into that middle 
ground where they contain good 

and bad in equal measure. A lot of 
these aren’t bad; they just aren’t 
memorable.

Having gone through this, 

I’d argue against the common 
criticism of modern film is that 
every movie is either a sequel, 
reboot, or remake. There are 
plenty of original films released 
in a year. Many of them fit into 
one of the two aforementioned 
categories. They either fly under 
the radar of most people, or they 
just aren’t all that good. If you’re 
looking for an original movie, 
chances are there is at least one 
playing near you; you may just 
have to look past the movies that 
have people lining up around the 
block.

Finally, 
it’s 
important 
to 

keep in mind that if you decide 
to 
do 
something 
like 
this, 

upon finding out about your 
financially inadvisable New Year’s 
Resolution, 
your 
roommate’s 

girlfriend will forcefully show 
you trailers to crappy looking 
movies so you have to see them. I 
learned this the hard way, and so I 
watched “Nine Lives.”

I have one month left in this 

experiment of mine, with about 
seventeen movies I’ve yet to see. 
It’s been bad for my eyes. It’s 
been bad for my wallet. It’s been 
awesome, and I can’t wait to do 
the same thing in 2017 and see 
what it has to bring. Besides, of 
course, another awesome “Star 
Wars” movie.

FILM NOTEBOOK

FILM NOTEBOOK


I

t’s simplistic to boil any 
TV series down to a one-
word theme, but “Orange 

is the New Black” has always 
had its mind on one concept 
in particular: empathy. When 
the 
series 
first 

premiered, its first 
season 
gradually 

showed 
us 
that 

Piper 
Chapman’s 

view of Litchfield 
Penitentiary 
was skewed; our 
initial perceptions 
of 
supporting 

characters 
came 

from how Piper 
viewed 
them. 

Suzanne, Taystee, Red — these 
are all characters who originally 
came across as one-dimensional 
threats, but as their backstories 
unfolded through flashbacks, we 
came to realize that they were 
more complex people than we 
imagined.

If the first three seasons were 

about humanizing the people we 
tend to think of reductively, the 
fourth season tested the limits of 
that philosophy. Does watching 
Healy struggle with his mother’s 
mental illness really excuse the 
multiple heinous acts he has 
committed over the course of the 
series? Does watching the young 
prison guard Bayley hanging out 
with his high school pals prove 
to us that he’s blameless in the 
murder of Poussey? What about 
the new correctional officers, 
whose traumatic experiences in 
the Army lead them to ruthlessly 
dehumanize and violate the 
prisoners?

Emily Nussbaum wrote about 

this phenomenon, about how the 
fourth season’s “smartest move 
was to interrogate empathy 
rather than treating it as a cure-
all.” She notes that “Empathy 
can be a bully’s demand: Feel 
my pain,” that the value of 
this challenging season of TV 
lies in its refusal to pretend 
every conflict can be solved 
with compassion and open-
mindedness.

The last season of “Orange is 

the New Black” aired in June, 
shortly 
after 
now-President-

elect Donald Trump became 
the presumptive nominee of 
the Republican Party. It was far 
enough along that Trump was 
an obvious threat, but it already 
seems like so long ago. It was 
before many of the controversies 
we think of now — a few 
weeks before Trump praised 
Saddam Hussein’s ability to kill 
terrorists, four months before 
The Washington Post released 
the “Access Hollywood” tape, 
four months before the series of 
sexual misconduct allegations 

came out. And the season was 
written and filmed, of course, 
much earlier. Filming began on 
June 15, 2015, one day before 
Trump formally launched his 
campaign.

In the month 

since the election, 
Americans 
— 

particularly liberal 
Americans 
like 

me, people who 
sometimes 
can’t 

help but see Trump 
supporters as an 
undifferentiated 
mass 
of 
racists, 

homophobes 
and 

misogynists 
— 

have had to consider the limits 
of empathy. The first day after 
the election, my friends seemed 
split; should we unapologetically 
block our friends and family 
on social media if they spewed 
hateful rhetoric, or should we 
engage with them?

I could, and can, see both 

sides. Maybe the only way to 
enact real change is by listening 
and trying to understand each 
other. 
It’s 
difficult, 
though, 

when we’re willing to have a 
conversation but the other side 
isn’t; is it only then acceptable to 
reject their presence altogether 
and wipe them from our Twitter 
feeds? Besides, it’s really hard 
to force yourself to confront 
someone sometimes. What if I 
don’t feel like getting in a long 
conversation with some random 
jackass I haven’t talked to since 
middle school, especially when 
I know he probably won’t budge 
in his unconditional devotion to 
a man I unequivocally despise?

In the last month, we’ve had 

to question how we think about 
empathy. There are countless 
articles refusing to grant Trump 
supporters respect for their 
beliefs; one article by Vox’s 
German Lopez asks the question 
“Should 
(racial 
resentment) 

be disqualifying for outreach 
efforts?” Another, from MTV’s 
Jamil Smith, notes that “We 
shouldn’t make empathy such 
an overriding priority in politics 
… I just don’t feel for a white 
Christian family man who may 
be down on his luck if he’s voting 
for white supremacy. That vote 
is an explicit message that he 
couldn’t give a damn about me.”

Jenji Kohan and her writers’ 

room can’t have known just how 
relevant their exploration of 
empathy would become in the 
year and a half since production 
began. But maybe they were 
already thinking about similar 
rhetoric 
that 
has 
played 

out in the recent past when 
people demanded empathy for 
perpetrators of violence. Maybe 

they 
consciously 
amended 

their “empathy for everyone” 
creed to include stipulations for 
unrelenting sadists and virulent 
racists. Regardless, the show 
will need to continue to grapple 
with these issues in the coming 
years — it’s renewed at least 
through a seventh season. The 
growing reticence to extend 
empathy might require Kohan 
to alter a significant part of her 
show’s DNA, to push its message 
even farther from its founding 
philosophies.

In a society that’s increasingly 

normalizing prejudice, liberals 
will challenge every act of 
empathy 
directed 
toward 
a 

malevolent voice. The “Orange” 
writers’ choice to portray Bayley 
as a generally unprejudiced, 
innocent kid was immediately 
met with controversy, partly 
because in reality, many of 
the acts of police brutality 
and general violence against 
Black people (those of Darren 
Wilson, Daniel Pantaleo, George 
Zimmerman, etc.) have clear 
racial 
connotations. 
I 
don’t 

personally 
agree 
with 
that 

criticism — the show doesn’t 
pretend its empathy is necessarily 
justifiable, and that’s the point 
— but the mere suggestion of 
compassion for a perpetrator can 
be unthinkable when the issue is 
so emotionally charged.

But 
this 
doesn’t 
end 
at 

“Orange is the New Black.” All 
art will have to consider these 
problems. Is it still enlightening 
to show how the mind of a racist 
works, or is it unfair to ask us 
to empathize with a despicable 
person when they won’t extend 
us the same kindness? Is it 
productive to analyze someone’s 
deeply 
ingrained, 
potentially 

harmful biases, or should we try 
to minimize the threat they pose 
by agreeing to discount their 
opinions altogether?

These are difficult questions, 

and I don’t have the answers. 
I generally espouse a belief in 
widespread empathy; it’s one 
of the reasons “Orange is the 
New Black” is one of, if not my 
single favorite TV show on the 
air. But it’s become clear that 
compassion isn’t all it takes, 
and in some cases, it might even 
have unexpectedly destructive 
consequences. In the next year, 
and in the years after that, it’ll 
be crucial how we respond to 
these pressures, and one thing 
is clear: artists are going to be 
the first people who form our 
impressions. The burden is on 
us, and the stakes are high.

DISNEY

When your island chief dad brings home Mountain Dew.

In keeping with its tradition 

of 
spotlighting 
diverse 

ethnicities and sectors of the 
world, Disney showcases the 
vibrant culture and landscape 
of ancient Polynesia in its new 
animated feature 
film 
“Moana.” 

Created by Ron 
Clements 
and 

John Musker, the 
brilliant 
minds 

behind 
classics 

such as “Aladdin” 
and “The Little 
Mermaid,” 
“Moana” 
proves 

once 
again 

that Disney is a master of 
storytelling.

The 
film 
tells 
the 
story 

of Moana (newcomer Auli’i 
Cravalho), 
the 
daughter 
of 

an island chief, who is torn 
between 
her 
responsibility 

toward her people, her love for 
her island and her longing for 
the sea. Realizing her destiny, 
Moana embarks on a quest to 
enlist the help of the demigod 
Maui 
(Dwayne 
Johnson, 

“Ballers”) and reverse a curse 
of natural decay catalyzed by 
his foolish actions. Lin Manuel 
Miranda, Opetaia Foa’i and 
Mark Mancina deliver original 
and infectious music that blends 
English 
and 
the 
Tokelauan 

language in lyrics and sound.

Disney masters the art of 

world building with the island 
of Motinui, Moana’s home. To 
carry out this ambitious project, 
the team of creators conducted 
diligent research on the native 
flora and fauna. In the film, the 
island is abundant with native 
plants and animals meshed 
seamlessly into the landscape, 
with vibrant colors and a diverse 
and rich ocean life. When 
watching the film, it’s difficult 

to catch and fully appreciate the 
scope of minute details involved, 
but the inability to spot these 
details lends to the success of the 
film in constructing a natural 
and believable landscape. The 
creators 
also 
payed 
careful 

attention to the culture of the 
native people, reconstructing 
traditional garb, tools, body 

art and textiles. 
Traditional dance 
and 
language 

are 
incorporated 

heavily into the 
fabric of the film, 
blending 
the 

world of ancient 
Polynesia 
with 

the audience and 
viewing culture of 
the 21st century. 

In 
“Moana,” 
mythology 

moves from a tradition of one-
dimensional oral storytelling 
to 
a 
fully 
immersive 
and 

interactive landscape in which 
there is no separation between 
the 
real 
and 
the 
fictional. 

Throughout the film, Moana 
interacts with icons of the 
stories she grew up hearing, 
and these figures both aid and 
inhibit her on her quest. The 
film also integrates the ghosts 
of her Polynesian ancestors, 
who act as visual reminders of 
the importance of voyaging in 
Moana’s culture. Moreover, the 
film emphasizes the dynamism 
of nature. The demigod Maui 
claims responsibility for the 
tides, sun, breeze, palm trees 
and the very island they inhabit, 
emphasizing his integral role 
in their world. The goddess 
Te Fiti, whom Moana shares a 
connection with, also serves 
as the physical emblem of life 
itself. Through its manipulation 
of mythology, Disney weaves 
ancient tradition, oral history 
and nature into one dynamic 
and 
fluid 
narrative. 
This 

reveals an audience desire for 
stories that break away from 

traditional, 
one-dimensional 

narratives in favor of stories 
that challenge the boundaries of 
time and space.

In regards to nature and 

innovative 
storytelling, 
the 

film’s only shortcoming lies 
in its characterization of the 
sea. In the film, the ocean is a 
dynamic character, imbued with 
personality and agency, playing 
the role of Moana’s guide and 
friend. However, as the most 
expansive and powerful natural 
force, the ocean in the film plays 
a minimal role in comparison 
to its full potential. While 
the ocean’s consciousness is 
imaginative and interesting, it 
would have been amazing to see 

its full power unleashed.

“Moana” 
is 
a 
refreshing 

break from classic tropes in 
the lineage of Disney princess 
movies. With the absence of a 
male love interest, the film is 
another success in providing 
feminist cinematic role models, 
especially in a tradition of 
passive 
female 
heroines. 

Additionally, Moana represents 
the first woman of color to star 
in a Disney movie without a love 
interest. The film is interestingly 
self-aware, commenting on its 
own tropes yet simultaneously 
reversing them. In one scene, 
Maui comments that “If you 
wear a dress, and have an animal 
sidekick, then you’re a princess.” 
Yet Moana, in character and the 
film itself, is unlike any of its 
Disney princess predecessors.

The Michigan hockey 

team suffered two straight 
blowout losses, 6-1 and 5-1, 

on the road at Penn State 

this weekend

Against Oregon in the second 

round of the NCAA Tournament, 
the Michigan volleyball team 
found itself facing adversity 
after dropping the first set. But 
the 
12th-seeded 
Wolverines 

showed no signs of panic. They 
fought back to defeat the Ducks, 
3-1, on Friday night at Crisler 
Center to advance to the NCAA 
Tournament Round of 16.

Buoyed 
by 
a 
spectacular 

performance from junior middle 
blocker Claire Kieffer-Wright, 

whose 20 kills and .730 kill 
percentage 
both 
represented 

career-highs, Michigan hit .344 
as a team in what doubled as the 
final home match for seniors 
Abby Cole, Ally Davis and Kelly 
Murphy. Cole, a unanimous 
all-Big Ten selection at middle 
blocker, contributed with 11 
kills of her own, while the 
Wolverines as a team racked up 
15 blocks on defense.

Michigan (11-9 Big Ten, 24-10 

overall) rolled over American 
on Thursday night to begin its 
postseason with a three-set 
sweep. But Oregon (13-7 Pac-12, 

21-10 overall) proved to be much 
more formidable opposition.

During the opening set, the 

aggressive and athletic Ducks 
asserted themselves early on, 
especially 
up 
front. 
Middle 

blockers 
Taylor 
Agost 
and 

Ronika Stone led a balanced 
Ducks attack, and though the 
margin was never more than 
three points, the Ducks drew 
first 
blood, 
outhitting 
the 

Wolverines .323 to .194 and 
winning the set 25-22.

 “(The Ducks are) really good 

when they’re in system,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 

“They’re really good when they 
control the ball well, and they 
come at you with a lot of pace and 
a lot of variety. In the first set, 
they did exactly what we were 
concerned they could do.”

But mere minutes later, the 

Wolverines showed what they 
could do, too.

It was Kieffer-Wright who got 

Michigan going in the second set. 
With the score tied at three, she 
rose up at the net and blocked a 
shot from Agost, raising her fist 
in the air in celebration upon 
landing. She then scored the 
next two points, first finishing 

a nifty tip around two Ducks 
and then smashing down a kill 
from the right side. When the 
run was over, the second set 
had been blown open, 12-4, in 
the Wolverines’ favor, and they 
never relinquished this lead on 
their way to taking the set, 25-17.

“(The 9-1 run was) really 

uplifting for the team because 
you know that you’re in a groove 
and you’re in a rhythm and 
everyone’s working together as 
one,” Kieffer-Wright said. “As 
the night progressed, we became 
one machine.”

Added 
Rosen: 
“Volleyball 

games tend to go in streaks, not 
one point here or one point there. 
Our servers really work hard in 
practice to be able to go and not 
just serve one ball aggressively, 
but serve that same ball three, 
four, five times.”

The third set, however, proved 

to be an almost polar opposite of 
the previous one, as the score was 
tied on 10 different occasions. 
Oregon, which held a slim lead 
for most of the set, pulled ahead 
15-12 by the first timeout, but 
Cole recorded two consecutive 
kills to bring Michigan back

This seemed like the year for Michigan football

I

t’s not often the Orange 
Bowl seems like a 
consolation prize.

It’s one 

of the most 
storied bowls 
in college 
football, 
guarantees a 
trip to Miami 
and has a 
prestige few 
others can 
match. But 
it feels like a 
consolation, 
doesn’t it? After everything the 
Michigan football team looked 
like it could be a month ago, 
this isn’t the big game in Florida 
the Wolverines looked like they 
might be headed for.

But that’s the reality now. Four 

points between two games kept 
Michigan from Indianapolis, 
which left the Wolverines with 
no recourse when the teams 
above them won on the final 
weekend of the season.

Michigan fans tuned into the 

Pac-12 Championship on Friday 
night to cheer on Colorado, a 
team the Wolverines beat in 
Spetember. They needed the 
Buffaloes to win to have a shot. 
When Colorado made a big play, 
the hope started to creep in. 
But the big payoff never came. 
Washington controlled its own 
fate, and it didn’t squander its 
chance. That’s what makes the 
Huskies a playoff team.

They may not actually be 

better than the Wolverines — nor 
might Clemson, which won six 
of its games by seven points or 
fewer — but both did what they 
had to, when they had to. And 
that’s the difference.

Michigan had a special team 

this year. One of its best ever. 
The Wolverines started the 
season on a nearly point-a-
minute pace, and their defense 
was the rare unit that was 

actually as good as advertised. 
To know that, you could look 
at Jabrill Peppers’ scoop and 
score against Michigan State 
or Jourdan Lewis’ interception 
against Wisconsin. But perhaps 
the best way to understand how 
unrelenting this defense was 
would be to look at one time it 
actually gave up a first down.

As J.T. Barrett fell forward 

toward the 15-yard line in double 
overtime, something stopped 
him. It was Chris Wormley’s 
arm. Barrett still ended up 
getting the first-down call, but 
without Wormley, there would 
have been no doubt. Even being 
blocked to the ground by a 
Buckeye, Wormley reached out 
and shoved Barrett back. The 
strength it takes to generate 
enough force in that motion 
must be astounding, but nothing 
compared to the will it demands.

When the season was on the 

line, Wormley found a way to do 
more than seemed possible. He 
didn’t get the call. But damned 
if it didn’t tell you everything 
you needed to know about the 
Wolverines.

That’s the way the unit played 

all year, with just a couple of 
quarters excepted. The first 
against Colorado and the fourth 
against Michigan State both 
could have gone better. But the 
Wolverines still won.

For the offense, the tough 

quarters proved more costly. 
Five yards against Ohio State 
simply wasn’t enough to hold off 
the Buckeyes. A road game at 
Kinnick Stadium was the wrong 
time for the offense to catch the 
yips. And yes, penalties factored 
heavily into both games. But 
as the Wolverines themselves 
would tell you, when you control 
your destiny, you have to actually 
control it. Leaving your fate up to 
referees and other teams is not a 
fun way to live.

“We take care of business, 

we’re in,” Jabrill Peppers 
tweeted Sunday. “We don’t, we’re 
not.. & we didn’t. Can’t knock the 
teams that did.”

It’s a sage attitude from a 

player who may not have another 
chance at this in college.

But the part that must cause 

the most heartbreak is that, 
deserved or not, this was a team 
that could have won it all. It’s 
not so much that the Wolverines 
looked like one of the nation’s 
four best teams, but that they 

were a team that looked good 
enough to win it all in most years.

Yes, Alabama exists. It was 

no guarantee. But Michigan 
had the look, the feel, the talent 
and the moxie of a team that 
wins it all. That’s why Sunday’s 
announcement feels so odd. The 
fact that the Wolverines didn’t 
get in is not a surprise given their 
resume. It’s that, for as dominant 
as they were, they still couldn’t 
do enough. It makes you wonder 
what it really takes to win a 

national title. 

But that’s what college football 

is. It’s a sport that allows teams 
like Colorado and Washington 
to surge forward at any given 
time and plant a flag in a season. 
It lets the Clemsons of the world 
rise to dominance in just a couple 
of years. You control your own 
destiny until the minute you 
relinquish it.

Michigan relinquished it.
That’s why, standing in an 

unusually subdued press room 

Sunday afternoon, senior tight 
end Jake Butt was left trying 
to explain his acceptance of an 
obviously disappointing fate.

“Do I feel like we’re one of the 

best four teams in the country?” 
Butt asked, “Absolutely I do. But 
that’s on us. We had chances to 
prove that. And we didn’t.”

Hungry Wolverines ready to turn the page

Chris Wormley was asleep 

when the Michigan football 
team learned its postseason fate 
Sunday afternoon.

The fifth-year senior defensive 

end was awake to watch the 
College Football Playoff selection 
show a few hours earlier, clinging 
to a shred of hope that the two-
loss Wolverines would sneak into 
the playoff.

Then Michigan flashed up 

as No. 6, and the dream of a 
national 
championship 
was 

gone. So Wormley went back 
to sleep, and he missed the 
initial announcement that the 
Wolverines 
would 
travel 
to 

Miami to face No. 11 Florida State 
in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 30.

But by the time Michigan 

players spoke to the media 
Sunday night, Wormley was 
refreshed and refocused. There 
was no point in moping around, 
he said — it was time to make a 
statement.

“I think we’re gonna be 

hungry, we’re gonna be angry 
and we’re gonna want to take it 
out on a team,” Wormley said. 
“Florida State’s just that next 
team up, so we’re excited for the 
challenge. … This game’s gonna 
prove a lot. I hope that it shows 
that we should be in that top 
four.”

Of course, after road losses 

to Iowa and No. 3 Ohio State, 
Michigan has itself to blame for 
coming up short of the playoff.

The Wolverines were ranked 

fifth heading into this weekend, 
with 
an 
outside 
chance 
of 

jumping into the top four if 
Clemson or Washington lost their 
conference championship games. 
But the Tigers and Huskies came 
out victorious, slamming that 
door shut.

“We can’t blame that on 

anyone 
but 
ourselves,” 
said 

senior tight end Jake Butt. “We 
left our fate in the hands of 
other teams, and we understand 
that. With that being said, we’re 
excited about this game. It’s a big 

game, a great opportunity for us 
to compete against a really good 
team.”

Michigan is a better and 

more accomplished team than 
it was a season ago, but it finds 
itself in a similar place as it did 
the end of the season. In 2015, 
the Wolverines finished 9-3 — 
ending their regular season with 
a disappointing loss to Ohio State 
— and felt they had something 
to prove in their Citrus Bowl 
matchup with Florida.

That feeling manifested itself 

in a 41-7 victory for Michigan, 
one that ended the season on 
a high note and kept the team 
trending upward.

The stage is a little bit bigger 

this year — the Wolverines will 
be playing in their first top-tier 
bowl game since the 2011 season 
— but the mindset remains the 
same.

“When we played (Florida) 

last year, we proved to a lot of 
people that we’re a very good 
team,” Wormley said. “That’s 
what we’re gonna do this game, 

too. … That’s our mindset for the 
next three and a half weeks.”

Last year, Michigan got into 

that mindset by running what 
many of the players called a 
“Christmas camp” — essentially 
a shortened version of spring or 
fall camp intended to push the 
players and get them in the best 
possible shape to play one more 
game.

The 
prospect 
of 
putting 

yourself through the wringer 
one last time might not sound 
appealing to a fifth-year senior, 
but Wormley is looking forward 
to taking on the challenge. Not 
only will it give the younger 
members of the roster a chance 
to further their development, 
but it also gives the seniors a 
chance to put an exclamation 
point on their season and 
career.

“This game in Miami is gonna 

be a statement game,” said fifth-
year senior defensive tackle Ryan 
Glasgow. “I want to leave this 
program on top, with a step in 
the right direction.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines head back 
on road to play Xavier

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team (7-1) is on a quest 
to earn a spot in the top-25 poll, 
and if the Wolverines can repeat 
last year’s victory over Xavier 
(5-0) in their Monday night 
matchup, they may have a shot.

Michigan 
figures 
to 
test 

Xavier’s defense, as well as 
its 
undefeated 
record. 
The 

Wolverines possess one weapon 
the Musketeers do not — junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty. As 
Michigan’s leading scorer, she 
has racked up 159 points in eight 
games.

Already, Flaherty has been 

named to the Big Ten Player of the 
Week Honor Roll and the watch 
list for three awards: the Wade 
Trophy, the Naismith Trophy and 
the Nancy Lieberman Award.

With her consistency, it’s no 

surprise that she’s garnered this 
much attention. Flaherty has 
scored double digits in every game, 
despite efforts to double-team her. 
It will take an impressive effort 
from Xavier to shut her down, 
and without accomplishing that, 
Michigan is likely to continue 
tallying up points.

Scoring shouldn’t be a problem 

for Michigan. On paper, the 
Wolverines score more and shoot 
better 
than 
the 
Musketeers. 

Xavier comes out ahead in a 
few categories, though, as the 
Musketeers average 45.8 rebounds 
a game, whereas Michigan has 
42.1. Xavier also averages 4.6 
blocks to the Wolverines’ 3.9.

Though 
Michigan 
has 

poorer defensive numbers, the 
Wolverines have compensated 
offensively. 
Their 
only 
real 

competition this season was 
Florida State — the top-10 team 
they lost to on Nov. 26 — and 
their offense has been the 
deciding factor in the other 
seven games, averaging a plus-
34.9 margin of victory.

But Xavier could present a 

problem for the Wolverines, if 
Michigan’s defense isn’t up to par.

“Our defense is getting better, 

and that’s really great to see,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“We really have emphasized that 
in the offseason and the preseason 
and have really wanted to become 
a better defensive team, and I 
think we are. We are still a work 
in progress, and we practice every 
day on our defensive stuff.

“We talk about our starting 

group a lot. But (sophomore 
guards Nicole Munger and Boogie 
Brozoski), I mean, they come 
in, and they just lift our defense 
and really give us a spark on the 
defensive end.”

Munger and Brozoski have 

also been known for their scoring 
prowess. The Wolverines will 
need both to come in strong off 
the bench to beat the Musketeers.

In a tight 78-66 game against 

then-No. 25 Gonzaga, Munger 
scored eight points and Brozoski 
added nine of her own, together 
ensuring a Michigan win. They 
have been a factor in almost every 
game, even if it does not appear in 
the box score.

The Wolverines have also been 

struggling with lowering their 
turnover percentage throughout 
the season, and have only recently 
started to limit their giveaways. 
Against Western Michigan two 
weeks ago, Michigan had 24.

“They forced us into a lot of 

turnovers,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And we lost possessions off of 
our turnovers, and that hurt our 
opportunity to score.”

In its last game of the Paradise 

Jam and its sole loss of the season, 
Michigan gave up 17 turnovers, 
but in the next contest, against 
Georgia Tech, it shrunk that 
number down to just nine.

“We kicked their butt,” Barnes 

Arico said. “I didn’t think that 
we were going to come in here 
and do that on somebody else’s 
home court, especially against a 
team that is 6-0 and has some real 
quality wins.”

If Michigan continues their 

trend of reducing turnovers, 
it should continue its winning 
streak into this week.

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

Jack LaFontaine made 70 saves over the weekend, but also let in seven goals.
Goaltending 
wasn’t the 
problem 

for Michigan

S

TATE COLLEGE — How 
difficult is it to play in 
Pegula Ice Arena? On a 

scale of one to 10, probably a 
10. If you’re a goaltender, make 
that 20.

The No. 20 Michigan 

hockey team learned that first 
hand this weekend, when a 
destructive performance from 
the seventh-ranked Nittany 
Lions 
featured a 
whopping 
106 shots 
over two 
games, 
both of 
which were 
blowout 
wins for 
Penn State.

This 

offense 
propelled Penn State to 6-1 
and 5-1 wins on Thursday 
and Friday, respectively. The 
Nittany Lions proved they 
could outshoot, outscore and 
outplay the Wolverines in 
almost every aspect of the 
game.

And Michigan’s netminders 

still had to stand on their 
heads to keep it that close. 
Goaltending wasn’t the 
problem.

Senior Zach Nagelvoort and 

freshman Jack LaFontaine 
basically went into the 
weekend’s games with targets 
attached to them. Between 
Penn State’s offense — which 
offered no mercy in the Big Ten 
season opener 
— and little 
defense in front 
of them, both 
goaltenders 
had to make 
an excessive 
amount of 
saves.

LaFontaine 

not only played 
at the end of 
the game on 
Friday, but also 
the entire game 
Saturday. He 
faced a combined 77 shots on 
the weekend, allowing seven 
goals.

“He’s tough,” said senior 

forward Alex Kile. “He’s a 
freshman, it’s not easy during 
this game. We didn’t really 
give him a great effort tonight 
defensively. We gave up 50-plus 
shots, so anytime you’re a 
goalie and you see 50 shots, it’s 
tough to win games and stop all 
the pucks.

“I’m not going to sit here 

and blame it on him because 
it wasn’t his fault, it was 
completely a team effort tonight, 
and we weren’t good defensively 
and you guys saw that.”

But almost more aggressive 

than the Nittany Lions was 

their student section. At 
Pegula, the visiting team is 
positioned to start and end on 
the same end of the ice that 
holds home to the sprawling 
Penn State student section, the 
“Roar Zone.”

It’s a section that students 

wait hours outside to get front-
row seats for. It sold out season 
tickets in less than five minutes. 
And it has absolutely no love for 
visiting goaltenders.

“We’re definitely trying 

to get inside their heads, 
especially the goalie, we’re 
really trying to get inside his 
head a lot,” said Mike Good, a 
senior at Penn State. “We have 
a really good student section 
here, and I think it’s a really 
good advantage we have when 
an opposing team comes here.”

The student section has 

cheers and chants specifically 
tailored to the opposing 
team’s goaltender, as do many 
throughout college hockey. 
But with such a large number 
of students and fans who 
participate — directly behind 
the person they’re chanting 
at — it’s undoubtedly difficult 
for a goaltender to save 53 of 
58 shots, as LaFontaine did on 
Saturday.

Someone who knows this 

well is the Nittany Lions’ 
freshman goaltender Peyton 
Jones, who doesn’t let his 
student section’s devotion go 
unnoticed.

“As a goalie, it’s pretty tough 

when you’re getting heckled 

all the game,” 
said Jones. 
“They’re 
screaming, 
yelling, 
banging on the 
boards, telling 
you, ‘You suck’ 
and all that 
stuff. Like it’s 
just tough, it 
really is. They 
don’t realize 
how big they 
are for us 
when they do 

that, because it really does get 
in a goalie’s head.”

A 6-1 or 5-1 loss is never 

going to be encouraged 
or supported. The losses 
Michigan faced on the road 
this weekend were high-
scoring and brutal, and there’s 
no denying that the Wolverines 
faced an uphill battle.

But LaFontaine and 

Nagelvoort did something this 
weekend that Michigan coach 
Red Berenson says often of his 
goaltenders — “They gave us a 
chance” — and really, what else 
can you ask from them?

‘M’ loses another blowout

STATE COLLEGE — Near 

the end of the second period, a 
scrum broke out between the 
Michigan 
and 
Penn 

State 
hockey 
teams. 
Senior 
defenseman 

Nolan De Jong jumped on the 
back of Penn State forward Zach 
Saar, pulling him to the ground, 
while Nittany Lion forward 
Nikita Pavlychev lay on top of 
sophomore forward Brendan 
Warren, pinning him to the ice.

Moments 
later, 
freshman 

defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce 

retaliated against a Penn State 
player after the whistle and was 
called for a penalty.

After all was said and done, 

the sixth-ranked Nittany Lions 
(2-0-0 Big Ten, 13-1-1 overall) 

took a 5-on-3 power play and 
a 3-1 lead into the second 
intermission.

Neither stat would stand 

long, though.

Just 24 seconds into the third 

period, 
Penn 
State 
forward 

Andrew Sturtz tipped a puck into 
the net past freshman goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine, 
extending 

the Nittany Lions’ lead and 
putting them well on their way 
to a physical 5-1 victory over the 
20th-ranked Wolverines.

“One 
team 
was 
getting 

embarrassed,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson on the 
physicality of the game. “We’ve 
got some pride, too.”

Added senior forward Alex 

Kile: “Any time we play Penn 
State, it’s going to be a physical 
game, especially in this rink. 
It’s a great crowd and a great 
student section. So when they 
get involved, it really helps 

the home team. They played 
physical, and it kind of makes us 
respond in the same way.”

Michigan’s only goal came 

early in the first period. After 
Penn State had taken an early 
1-0 lead, senior forward Max 
Shuart took the puck into the 
offensive zone. He then laid the 
puck off backhand for junior 
forward Cutler Martin, who 
fired the puck into the back of 
the net to even the score.

But the Wolverines (0-2-0, 

6-7-1) ultimately couldn’t keep 
up with the Nittany Lions, 
being outshot, 58-23. And much 
like senior goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort the night before, 
LaFontaine was praised for 
his play on the night. Despite 
allowing 
five 
goals, 
the 

freshman set a career-high in 
saves with 53.

“I thought he played well,” 

Berenson said. “I thought he 

stayed in the game and gave us 
a chance.”

Arguably the strongest part 

of Michigan’s team all season 
has been its penalty kill — the 
Wolverines’ unit entered the 
weekend ranked first nationally 
in the category. But even that 
unit was exposed by Penn State, 
which scored four power-play 
goals on the weekend.

Michigan will return home 

next week to take on Wisconsin 
— which boasts another top-
20 offense — before taking 
a break for Christmas. And 
if the Wolverines are unable 
to shore up their defensive 
weaknesses that were exposed 
this weekend, they may be in for 
another long series.

“As a unit of five on the ice, we 

have to be better,” Bernson said. 
“Penn State put on a clinic this 
weekend, and we’ve got to learn 
from it.”

Massa leads ‘M’ to ninth-place finish

Many of Michigan’s young 

wrestlers 
walked 
into 
the 

biggest event of their careers this 
weekend, but they were prepared.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Logan 

Massa 
became 
the 
fourth 

Michigan wrestler to win an 
individual title at the Cliff Keen 
Las Vegas Invitational, and the 
first to do so since 2007.

During 
this 
weekend’s 

tournament, named after the 
famed Michigan wrestler Cliff 
Keen, Massa led a Wolverine 
squad that notched 73 points to 
finish ninth out of 36 competing 
teams.

Despite falling two spots from 

last year’s seventh-place finish in 
the tournament, Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland was still pleased 
with his wrestlers.

“This is our first two-day 

tournament, 
a 
big 
test 
for 

us,” 
McFarland 
said. 
“(I’m) 

pleased with some individual 
performances.”

Massa defeated Wisconsin’s 

Isaac Joseph to win the title 
in the 165-pound weight class, 
finishing with a 6-0 record in the 
tournament. 

“It’s pretty cool, a great 

experience,” Massa said.

McFarland also had a lot of 

praise for his wrestler, calling 
him a “fierce competitor” and 
“very focused.”

Besides Massa, two other 

freshmen placed 
top-three in their 
respective weight 
classes. 
Myles 

Amine 
finished 

third in the 174-
pound 
division, 

after 
he 
was 

defeated by Iowa 
State’s 
Leland 

Weatherspoon, 
ending 
the 

tournament 
with a 6-2 record. Stevan Micic 
finished second in the 133-
pound weight class after he was 
defeated by Ohio State’s Nathan 
Tomasello, 
the 
nation’s 
top-

ranked wrestler in that weight 
class.

Two other Michigan wrestlers, 

freshman Sal Profaci and senior 
Brian Murphy, made it past 
the first day of the invitational. 
Murphy is also the top-ranked 
wrestler in the 157-pound weight 
class.

Propelled by five top-three 

performances, 
Ohio 
State 

finished first in the invitational 

with 118.5 points. 
Wisconsin 
and 

Virginia 
Tech 

finished 
second 

and 
third, 

respectively.

With 
their 

solid showing at 
the invitational, 
the tournament 
provided another 
opportunity 
for 

the Wolverines to 

showcase their strong freshman 
class.

Six 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

starters in the invitational were 
freshmen, and having so many 

young wrestlers on the team this 
year has left an impact.

“We’re all really close as a 

group, get along great,” Massa 
said. “(We) push each other to get 
better.”

McFarland pointed out that 

having such a young group poses 
unique challenges to his strategy, 
but it also provides the group 
many opportunities to develop. 
He commented on how he has 
changed up his coaching style 
because of the large number of 
underclassmen.

While 
Michigan’s 
coach 

was satisfied with his team’s 
performance, especially given the 
fact that the season is still young, 
he also added that the Wolverines 
need to work on improving some 
areas.

“I can’t emphasize enough 

how 
important 
that 
match 

readiness is,” McFarland said. “In 
some cases, our guys just weren’t 
at that level of intensity and 
readiness that we needed to be.

“And in some cases I think that 

was the difference.”

Michigan throttles Kennesaw State

John Beilein said the defense 

in the last four minutes of each 
half in the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
73-70 
overtime 
loss against Virginia Tech on 
Wednesday night was “some of 
the worst defense (he’d) ever 
seen.”

For 
the 
Michigan 
head 

coach and his team, Saturday 
afternoon’s 
start 
against 

Kennesaw State (3-6) wasn’t 
much better.

The Owls took advantage of 

a couple missed assignments 
by Michigan and coupled them 
with some big shots to start 
the game strong. At one point, 
Kennesaw State found itself up 
by two with 11:15 remaining in 
the first half. But the Wolverines 
(6-2) righted the ship after that, 
beating the Owls, 82-55.

“We bounced back today,” 

Beilein said. “We answered 
(Kennesaw 
State’s) 
first 
10 

minutes 
when 
they 
played 

straight up.”

Unlike the last four minutes 

of Wednesday’s game, though, 
Michigan’s offense played much 
better, shooting 57.1 percent in 
the first half.

After 
a 
big 
night 
for 

sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner against Virginia Tech 
that saw him score 11 points on 
5-of-6 shooting, he followed it 
up with another strong offensive 
performance. Wagner put up 14 
points in the first half to lead 
Michigan and ended the game 
with a career-high 20 on 7-of-8 
shooting, which included 3-of-4 
from beyond the arc.

But Wagner was quick to point 

out the Wolverines’ defensive 
prowess.

“I’m very happy about the 

(scoring) obviously,” Wagner said. 

“But I’m more happy about how 
we got out there defensively.”

“They usually score a good 

amount of points, in the 80s, and 
we held them down to 55.”

Kennesaw State held serve 

for most of the first half, much 
to the credit of 
guard Kendrick 
Ray, who led all 
scorers in the 
opening period 
with 15 points. 
Ray 
finished 

with 24 points.

“(Ray 
is) 
a 

really 
talented 

player,” 
Beilein 

said. “A fifth-year 
guy, averaging 22 
points per game, and he’s one of 
the better guards we’ll see this 
year in terms of scoring guards.”

The Wolverines started to 

pull away with just under five 
minutes remaining in the first 

half. Wagner rattled home a 
3-pointer with 4:29 to go in the 
half, initiating a 17-2 run from 
which the Owls couldn’t ever 
fully recovered. Michigan led, 
47-29, at halftime.

The Wolverines carried their 

solid 
defense 

into the second 
half, when they 
held 
Kennesaw 

State 
to 
no 

points for almost 
five 
minutes. 

Michigan 
limited the Owls 
to just 26 points 
total 
in 
the 

second frame.

After redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
registered just two points and 
one rebound Wednesday against 
Virginia Tech before fouling 
out, he responded with 15 points 
and 11 rebounds for his second 

career double-double.

“I like that (Wilson) has some 

athleticism and a desire to get in 
there and mix it up,” Beilein said. 
“For him to get a double-double, 
it’s good that he’s mixing it up. 
That was not happening a couple 
years ago. He was drifting out by 
the (3-point line).”

And after putting up 23 points 

on Wednesday, senior forward 
Zak Irvin replicated his offensive 
performance, scoring 19 points, 
with many of his points coming 
on drives to the basket.

Saturday marked the second 

time that the Wolverines have 
emphatically responded to a 
crushing loss in their young 
season. And with Texas and 
No. 11 UCLA, which upset No. 1 
Kentucky on Saturday, looming 
in the upcoming week, the 
question for Michigan will be if 
it can replicate its performance 
in the next couple games.

Late first-half run lifts Wolverines to bounce-back victory at Crisler Center

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Wagner helps put 
‘M’ back on track

Last Saturday, coming off 

its first loss to South Carolina, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team needed someone to lead 
the way in order to put up a 
strong response in its next 
game against Mount St. Mary’s. 
The Wolverines found their 
man in sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner, who rose to 
the occasion with a 13-point 
performance — the second-
highest total of the night — in a 
64-47 win.

Providing 
the 
aggressive 

inside presence Michigan sorely 
missed against the Gamecocks, 
Wagner went 5-for-8 from the 
floor with six rebounds and 
two blocks, in addition to going 
3-for-5 from downtown.

On Saturday, coming off 

a 
stunning 
73-70 
loss 
to 

Virginia Tech, the Wolverines 
needed another boost against 
Kennesaw State. This time, the 
same story came to fruition, and 
then some.

Wagner 
topped 
himself 

against the Owls, setting a new 
career high with 20 points, as 
Michigan 
easily 
dispatched 

Kennesaw State, 82-55.

“I just try to stay focused 

regardless of the opponent, 
regardless of the situation, and 
especially after a loss,” Wagner 
said. “It’s very important for me 
that the team comes out strong 
and shows strength because a 
loss can happen, but two losses 
hurt way more. So I’m happy we 
could make these adjustments.”

Scoring 14 of those points in 

the first half alone to exceed his 
tally from a week ago, he led 
the Wolverines in the category. 
Often finding himself open on 
the perimeter, Wagner didn’t 
hesitate to pull the trigger. 
Almost 
half 
of 
his 
points 

came from distance, where he 
finished 3-for-4, including a trey 
to open the game and set the 
tone for the afternoon. But he 
was quick to deflect the credit 
to his teammates for creating 
space for him to operate.

“They’re all very aggressive 

(and) they’re all very talented,” 
Wagner said. “It doesn’t give 
the defense a lot of opportunity 
to focus on a certain guy. … The 
spacing and the way we move, 
it’s just really hard to guard.”

With 
a 
more 
aggressive 

approach going to the basket 
once again, Wagner took charge 
of the middle. He went after 
Kennesaw State, slicing his 
way through the defense and 
imposing his will in the post. 
Three of his points also came 
from the charity stripe.

While 
the 
offense 
isn’t 

designed 
to 
run 
through 

him, Wagner has a knack for 
making his own opportunities. 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
has a plethora of offensive 
weapons to choose from, and 
Wagner may not have been 
considered one of the top 
options before the season began, 
but he is starting to change that 
narrative.

“He’s got a great ability to 

both shoot from the outside 
(and) drive a little bit, and 
we’re just trying to find these 
windows that we could use him 
offensively,” Beilein said. “He’s 
just maturing as a player.”

Though he is still figuring out 

his role on the team, his play at the 
‘5,’ which Beilein called “one of 
the most difficult, if not the most 
difficult, positions on the court,” 
has become crucially important to 
the Wolverines of late.

Playing a starring role in both 

games to help Michigan bounce 
back from tough losses, Wagner 
has come up big when the 
Wolverines needed him the most.

THE MICHIGAN 

DAILY TOP-10 POLL 

2. OHIO STATE: Rural Meyer. 
LOL, get it?

1. ALABAMA: Bama in the 
playoffs is as inevitable as 
death itself. You know it’s 
coming, and it’s not fun for 
anyone involved.

9. USC: The Trojans had to 
watch two teams they beat 
play for the conference title 
on Saturday. Can you even 
imagine?

3. CLEMSON: They’re in the 
playoff, but rumor has it the 
Tigers are about to trade 
J.D. Martinez and Justin 
Verlander.

6. PENN STATE: Strange that 
the best team in the Big Ten is 
this low in the rankings.

5. MICHIGAN: At least the 
Lions will make the playoffs...

7. OKLAHOMA: Baker 
Mayfield is coming back next 
year, because missing one CFP 
just wasn’t enough.

4. WASHINGTON: Browning… 
in the Peach Bowl… playing a 
bruising defense… yeah we’ve 
got nothing.

8. WISCONSIN: The Badgers 
are without a paddle after their 
last loss. Luckily, they face 
Western Michigan next.

10. WESTERN MICHIGAN: 
Kalamazoo is looking like a 
much more attractive landing 
spot for Brian Kelly after his 
inevitable firing.

Each week, Daily sports staffers fill out ballots, with 
first-place votes receiving 10 points, second-place 

votes receiving nine and so on. 

to a tie at 19. With Oregon 
leading 23-22, Kieffer-Wright 
put away two kills to put the 
Wolverines a point away, and 
junior outside hitter Carly 
Skjodt then punctuated the set 
with a block to finish off the 
tense, back-and-forth affair.

“We spent a lot of the 

season one or two points 
behind,” said freshman setter 
MacKenzi Welsh. “So we’ve 
gotten really good from those 
small deficits. That block was 
a huge turning point for us, 
and we’ve practiced that all 
season.”

However, 
the 
Ducks 

weren’t finished, starting the 
fourth set by roaring to a 6-2 
lead. But as always, Michigan 
was 
undeterred, 
rattling 

off the next five points and 
eventually going on top by 
as much as five, picking up 
intensity with every rally.

At 21-17, the Wolverines 

began their final push. Skjodt 
stepped back to serve and 
drilled two consecutive aces 
to bring the Wolverines a point 
away, and Davis closed out 
the hard-fought match with a 
kill to clinch Michigan’s first 
appearance in the Round of 16 
since 2012.

With 
the 
win, 
the 

Wolverines 
will 
travel 
to 

Austin, Texas, to take on 
Creighton on Dec. 9, with 
the winner of that matchup 
playing either No. 5 Texas or 
BYU for a place in the Final 
Four.

“I’m really proud of how 

our players looked after (the 
first set),” Rosen said. “We 
served really aggressively, we 
out-assisted them, we started 
defending them and we made 
some really good adjustments 
with blocking because they 
were picking us apart a little 
bit. I’m just really proud of 
how we fought through.”

“Fought through” is an 

apt description of Michigan’s 
performance on Friday night. 
It was a slugfest between two 
talented teams, and at no point 
was it easy. But the Wolverines 
earned the right to continue 
their season.

VOLLEYBALL
From Page 1B
Home crowd sparks victory

With the second set tied 

at one, junior middle blocker 
Claire Kieffer-Wright hurried 
from the middle of the court 
to the right side, swung herself 
into the air and came down 
mercilessly on the volleyball, 
burying it past the Oregon 
players to bring a 2000-strong 
Crisler Center crowd to life.

And Kieffer-Wright didn’t 

stop there: She assisted on a 
block and followed with two 
consecutive kills en route to a 
9-1 run. The shift led to three 
consecutive set victories and 
an eventual 3-1 win for the 
Michigan volleyball team in 
the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament, advancing to the 
Sweet Sixteen.

Throughout 
a 
victorious 

opening stanza for the Ducks, 
Oregon’s 
bench 
and 
small 

contingent of fans were able 
to match the yells and cheers 
of the Wolverines and the 
home crowd Friday night. “Go 
Blue” chants were silenced 
by the performance of the 
Ducks’ attackers and a sloppy 
set from Michigan, which had 
a 
lackluster 
19.4 
attacking 

percentage on 12 kills in its first 
set defeat of the championship.

“On the first set, they really 

attacked us from the right side,” 
Kieffer-Wright said. “But once 
we made our adjustments, I 
think (the second) was a good 
turning point for us.”

Oregon, however, commanded 

the start of the fourth set by 
jumping out to a 5-1 advantage. 
Enter Kieffer-Wright, who once 
again came in off the bench to 
block two shots and kill two 
more hits, giving the Wolverines 
an 8-6 lead and forcing a Ducks’ 
timeout and corresponding roars 
from the crowd.

“Obviously, 
it’s 
a 
big 

advantage playing at home,” 
said senior middle blocker 
Abby Cole. “(The crowd) was 
just a reminder that we’re at 
home, and this is our house 
— that’s kind of a pride thing. 
We’re not going to be beaten in 

our house.”

Shifting 
the 
match’s 

momentum 
at 
the 
most 

vulnerable points for Michigan 
— both after the team was down 
a set and when Oregon looked 
poised to force a tie-breaking 
fifth frame — was just part of the 
night for Kieffer-Wright, who 
set career highs with 20 kills 
on a 72 attacking percentage. 
But the junior doesn’t want to 
limit, or dwell upon, the best 
match of her Wolverine career, 
statistically.

“I think it was a good one, but 

there’s more to come,” Kieffer-
Wright said. “I don’t want to 
hang my hat on this match, 
but I’m happy that we got the 
win. I think it’s just a credit to 
my team. I couldn’t get 20 kills 
without a great setter, a great 
defense and all of their support.

“I’m really excited for what’s 

to come.”

Michigan coach Mark Rosen 

noted that the middle blocker’s 
effort opened doors for other 
players to contribute as well.

“Individually, Claire did an 

unbelievable job of just finding 
ways to get kills — she’s really 
efficient,” Rosen said. “And 
then that fed everybody else 
because (Oregon) had to focus 
too much on her, it just opened 
everything else up.”

Freshman 
middle 
blocker 

Cori Crocker and Cole added 
seven and 11 kills, respectively, 
while sophomore outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt killed eight hits of 
her own.

With the victory, Michigan 

will travel to Austin, Texas, for 
a match against Creighton in 
the NCAA Regional Semifinals 
on Friday. Much to the elation 
of the Wolverines, the Blue 
Jays upset No. 5 Kansas in the 
second round, making the path 
to a national championship 
at least seemingly easier for 
Michigan.

And while the home crowd 

won’t be with the Wolverines 
for 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 

postseason, Kieffer-Wright will 
— and that could just be enough 
to spark Michigan to a deep run 
in the NCAA Tournament.
