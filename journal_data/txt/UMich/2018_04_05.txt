Donned in maize and blue 

T-shirts that read “Michigan 
Grandpa” 
and 
“Michigan 

Mom,” Freddy Kennett and 
Robby Hauldren took the stage 
at Ann Arbor’s Hill Auditorium 
for Music Matters’s annual 
SpringFest. Five months ago, 
the duo electrified the crowd 
at Detroit’s Masonic Temple 
with a phenomenal rundown 
through 
their 
discography, 

but last night’s performance 
was 
different. 
After 
trips 

to both Europe and South 
America 
for 
a 
tour 
with 

Whethan and performances 
for 
Lollapalooza’s 
regional 

tour 
respectively, 
Kennett 

and Hauldren seemed to have 
a stronger grasp of how to 
transform an EDM show from 
a disk-spinning display of 
their content into a dynamic 
and engaging experience.

With new music to work 

with, like their beat tape 
Honey, Kennett and Hauldren 
layered tracks left and right. 
Their 
famed 
release, 
“It’s 

Strange,” normally reserved 
for the show’s encore, was 
thrown in mid-set with the 

heavy beat of “Drip Drip” 
in 
the 
background. 
They 

also paid their respects to 
electronic 
music 
pioneers, 

Justice, with a remix of the 
group’s hit track “D.A.N.C.E.” 
Still, they didn’t shy away from 
unadulterated crowd-pleasing 
hits, ending the evening with 
their most recent blow-up 
track, “Last To Leave.” All 
in all, the performance was 
engaging and unpredictable, 
aspects that can be hard to 
come by at EDM shows, where 

songs are often played in 
isolation with no regard for 
live arrangement.

The show’s opening acts, 

Miller Guth and Lost Kings, 
also 
put 
on 
impressive 

performances, 
with 
the 

typically 
pop-driven 
Lost 

Kings 
toying 
with 
head-

banging bass drops. These 
acts, plus a more artistically 
mature Louis The Child, made 
this 
year’s 
SpringFest 
an 

absolute success.

In commemoration of the 50th 

anniversary of Martin Luther 
King Jr.’s passing, the Ford School 
of Public Policy held a policy 
talk Wednesday evening on the 
prospects of the healthcare in the 
United States and the Affordable 
Care Act. The talk began with an 
introduction from Law professor 
Michael Barr.

Barr 
highlighted 
King’s 

work during his “Poor People’s” 
campaign, which was designed 
to draw attention to U.S. poverty 
in the late 1960s with special 
attention to poor health care.

“Of all the forms of inequality, 

injustice in health care is the most 
shocking and inhumane,” King 
said at a 1966 Medical Committee 
for Human Rights convention. 

The talk was moderated by 

Public Policy professor Paula 
Lantz, who explained the context 
of the ACA during its creation 
under President Barack Obama’s 
administration, as well as current 
disparagement 
by 
President 

Donald Trump’s administration.

The ACA introduced new 

restrictions on health care: With 
few exceptions, citizens were 
required to obtain health care 
coverage, 
allowing 
states 
to 

expand their Medicaid programs 
to those who previously didn’t 
qualify. 
However, 
critics 
of 

the ACA point out its cost and 
inequitable distributions among 
classes.

Lantz asked panelists where 

the Affordable Care Act stands 
today, and how it has changed 
under the Trump administration 
after an agressive but ultimately 
doomed campaign to ‘repeal 
and replace.’ Economist Gail 
Wilensky, 
former 
President 

George H.W. Bush’s senior health 
and welfare adviser, opened the 
debate by noting she believes 
the Trump administration has 
passed very little legislation with 
regard to the act the threat of 
repeal.

“Despite the efforts of not 

very 
effective 
Republicans 

in Congress, there has been 
precious little change on the ACA 
in terms of participation both 
by individuals and insurance 
companies,” Wilensky said.

Jonathan 
Cohn, 
a 
senior 

national correspondent at the 
Huffington Post, identified two 
main successes of the ACA. First, 
he argued, the ACA has increased 
human welfare and access to care 
through its national coverage 

expansion.

“These aren’t just numbers 

and stats, these are really people 
getting health care,” Cohn said.

Second, 
Cohn 
noted 
the 

ACA 
has 
changed 
political 

conversation and expectations 
of what the government should 
provide its people. Even though 
the ACA has been criticized by 
many, those same critics do not 
support absolute repeal.

Vice President of Development Jerry 
May announces year-end retirement

University of Michigan Vice 

President 
for 
Development 

Jerry 
May 
announced 
his 

plans to retire at the end of 
the year after nearly three 
decades 
of 
expanding 
the 

school’s fundraising efforts to 
record heights.

May has been affiliated 

with the University since his 
time as a graduate student in 
the higher education program, 
during which he then took 
on a job in the Development 
Office. After spending 13 years 

in the position, he left to lead 
the 
Ohio 
State 
University 

fundraising team and raised a 
$1.23 billion campaign — the 
most successful in the school’s 
history. In 2003, May returned 
to the University as the vice 
president 
for 
development 

and since has undertaken a 
variety of projects. One of 
such projects is the Victors 
for 
Michigan 
fundraising 

campaign, launched in 2011, 
which 
raises 
money 
for 

increasing “student support, 
engaged learning and bold 
ideas.”

The seven-and-a-half-year 

campaign is now its final 

stretch, and though the final 
amount has not yet been 
determined, May’s office is 
already $330 million past its 
$4 billion goal. Campaign 
Director 
Todd 
Baily 
has 

known May for 30 years, and 
described him as a dedicated 
individual who is held in high 
esteem by his coworkers.

“It’s been a great pleasure 

working 
with 
him,” 
Baily 

said. “I don’t think anybody 
could find a more committed, 
passionate, 
development 

professional, 
either 
here 

at Michigan or across the 
country. Jerry is very well 
respected 
nationally 
by 

peer institutions for his 
fundraising 
leadership. 

He 
is 
extremely 

knowledgeable about the 
profession and an expert 
on 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan.”

However, 
before 
he 

reaches retirement, May 
explained he still plans 
to continue working and 
travel to many major cities 
over the next two month.

“I’m 
going 
to 
keep 

raising 
money 
for 
the 

University,” May said. “I’m 
going to try to support all 
the 
good 
development 

professionals we have at 
the University, work with 
the wonderful volunteers 
who help us raise the 
money 
and 
continue 

working as far past the 
campaign goal as we can. 
I got nine more months to 
do that.”

May also reflected on 

his time at the University, 
and said he continued to 
work here because of the 
quality of the University, 
the 
passion 
of 
those 

with whom he worked and 
the exciting challenges of 
fundraising.

“The reason I stayed is 

because I love the University 
of Michigan; you can’t work 
for a better place with a 
better product, that’s the first 
thing,” May said. “Secondly, 
the donors and volunteers — 
there stand no equals – they’re 
among 
the 
most 
talented, 

skilled people I’ve ever worked 
with … I love the challenge of 
mounting campaigns, that’s 
probably 
my 
specialty 
… 

Michigan continues to have 
the appetite to achieve in its 
fundraising.”

Some 
of 
May’s 
greatest 

moments at the University 
included working with big 
donors such as Bert Askwith, 
Stephen Ross, and Richard 
and Susan Rogel — just last 
week, the latter donated$150 
million to the University for 
cancer research.

“The kind of thing that gets 

me — what you call the great 
moments that give me the most 
satisfaction — is working with 
someone like Bert Askwith, 
and all the things that give 
him joy and help him support 
the University,” May said. “For 
me, it’s working with a donor 
and matching them up to 
things that give them passion, 
make them smile and make 
them feel good and that makes 
me feel good.”

Pam 
Stout, 
the 
senior 

director 
of 
executive 

communications, 
also 

touched on this enthusiasm 
while thinking back on her 
experiences 
working 
with 

May. Stout has been working 
closely with May over the 
past year and described his 

One of May’s biggest accomplishments was the Victors for Michigan campaign

genuine 
passion 
allowed 

him to establish meaningful 
connections with those he 
encountered.

“He really cares about the 

people he works with,” Stout 
said. “He really wants to treat 
every 
donor 
with 
respect 

and integrity, but also holds 
the highest values of the 
University in check. He has an 
incredible memory for details. 
You can be in an event with 500 
people and he can walk over to 
somebody and remember what 
their children are up to and 
where they went to school … 
and it’s really amazing.”

In the future, May hopes 

the University continues to 
encourage students to pursue 
higher education and remain 

a leader in various disciplines.

“I 
hope 
the 
University 

of Michigan will always be 
a leader — that’s first and 
foremost — always be an 
academic leader, an athletic 
leader, a cultural and arts 
leader,” May said. “I hope we 
have people that come up with 
new innovations in science 
and technology. I hope we 
play a major role in helping 
to solve diseases or at least 
help patients manage chronic 
illness better. I hope we keep 
teaching students the joy of 
learning. Higher education is 
not just about a job, it should 
be about what you learn to add 
to the quality of your life.”

As for himself, May admitted 

while he wasn’t entirely ready 
to retire, he hopes to continue 
to help the University in 
different 
ways 
and 
looks 

forward to having more time 
for leisurely activities.

“I love what I do, truthfully 

I’m not really entirely ready 
to retire, but I’ve decided I’m 
going to retire because you 
can’t have it both ways,” May 
said. “I want more time for 
myself. I want more time to 
do fun things. I want to travel 
… but I hope I’ll always keep 
my hands in some kind of 
fundraising and helping the 
University as a volunteer or 
through consulting work.”

SWING INTO SPRING

CARTER FOX/Daily

The MSwing club dances at their last Swing event of the semester at the League Wednesday night. 

bargaining 
sessions 
with 

the University, lecturers say 
though progress has been made 
on some issues, the negotiations 
are “still a long way from what 
is required.”

“This is not enough given 

that salary is the number one 
issue,” Robinson said.

LEO 
represents 
nearly 

1,700 non-tenure track faculty 
members at U-M Ann Arbor, 
Flint and Dearborn campuses. 
Bargaining began last semester, 

as its current contract, which 
has a no strike clause, expires 
April 20.

The minimum starting salary 

for a lecturer in is $34,500 in 
Ann Arbor, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. LEO has 
asked that the minimum be 
raised to $60,000 in Ann Arbor 
and $56,000 in Dearborn and 
Flint. The University responded 
with an offer of $40,000 in Ann 
Arbor, $31,300 in Dearborn and 
$30,300 in Flint with gradual 
increases.

Following 
general 

membership meetings on all 
three campuses this week, a 

final meeting is planned for 
Sunday to review bargaining 
process up to that point. The 
Union 
Council, 
an 
eight-

member body comprised of 
elected leadership and campus 
chairs, 
will 
then 
decide 

whether or not to call a strike.

Robinson said there are three 

possibilities at this point.

“One outcome is that they 

bring in an offer in the next 
couple of days that we can say 
is just,” Robinson said. In that 
case, the union bargaining team 
would bring the proposal before 
members for a ratification vote 
and the walkout would be 

canceled.

If 
no 
such 
development 

is made, Robinson said, the 
“strike is inevitable.” However, 
a third option is available.

“If they don’t come to table 

with an adequate deal but it 
shows enough progress that 
we can call off the strike in 
good faith, then we will,” 
Robinson 
said. 
“We 
would 

call of the strike and continue 
bargaining.”

University 
spokesman 

Rick Fitzgerald said in an 
email administration remains 
“hopeful” a compromise will 
be reached before the union’s 

contract expires.

“A work stoppage or strike 

by LEO members has its biggest 
negative impact on students at 
a critical time near the end of 
the academic year,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “The University believes 
strongly that the collective 
bargaining process is effective 
and there is no need for LEO to 
call for a strike.”

Under 
state 
law, 
teacher 

strikes and strikes by public 
employeesare illegal.

Robinson 
called 
the 

prohibition “unjust.”

“From time to time states 

pass unjust laws and this is one 

of them,” he said. “Sometimes 
we have a duty to violate unjust 
laws. We’re not going to stand 
for unjust laws that stop us 
from getting a just contract.”

Teachers recently instigated 

a statewide strike in West 
Virginia, where such action is 
also against the law.

Robinson also said he laid 

the blame for the strike on the 
University.

“If we do go out on Monday 

and Tuesday, I put that on 
them,” he said. “They need to 
come to the table and make 
right what has been wrong for 
so long.”

a lot of local vendors where a 
lot of bigger chains don’t have 
the desire or drive to do that,” 
Handlesman said. “We try to 
provide education in our store 
and better everyone’s health by 
educating and offering superior 
products at a superior price.”

LSA junior Ainsley Belisle 

started going to Better Health 
four years ago after she had 
developed an allergy to gluten.

“For me, they’re really good 

about having lots of different 
options for allergies,” Belisle 
said. “They’re very nice; I 
remember we were at the store 
asking if they had something, 
and they were like ‘No, but 
we’ll order it.’”

When it comes to running an 

organic food store, competition 
is 
always 
a 
challenge. 

According 
to 
Handlesman, 

new 
competitors 
entering 

and exiting the market keeps 
owners on their toes.

“With Amazon buying Whole 

Foods, it’s becoming more of a 
mature business,” Handlesman 
said. “It’s a challenge that way, 
but we’ve been able to grow 
through it by taking good care 
of our customers and making 
sure they get a different value 
than they can get from anyone 
else.”

Better Health Market and 

Café offers a wide selection 
of organic produce. The store 
provides sugar-free, gluten-
free and dairy-free products, 
in addition to a wide range of 
vegetarian and vegan options.

LSA junior Jonathan George 

regularly grows fruits and 
vegetables in his spare time 
and enjoys having access to 
the freshest produce he can 
find. George believes students 
should try to buy fresh produce 
if they’re able.

“Well first, it’s healthier 

and it’s just more interesting,” 
George said. “People don’t 
realize just the variety of fruits 
and vegetables available to us 
at these stores. And it tastes 
better too.”

neighborhoods the University 
of Michigan Student Advisory 
Council identified as lacking 
proper lighting in a 2017 report.

Councilmember Julie Grand, 

D-Ward 3, corroborated these 
findings and explains crime 
seems to concentrate around 
student neighborhoods.

“Lights 
certainly 
make 

people feel safer whether or 
not they’re actually related 
to crime,” Grand said. “I keep 
tabs on my ward where crime 
is highest and the student areas 
are definitely one of those. 
Through the Student Advisory 
Council and others, we are 
trying to work to increase 
street lighting.”

Former SAC Chair Jeremy 

Glick, an LSA senior, said he 
sees the concentration of crime 
in 
student 
neighborhoods 

not only as the result of poor 
lighting, but also a lack of 
education 
among 
students 

regarding safety.

“There definitely seems to 

be an uptick in crime in the 
Packard area,” Glick said. “This 
is a non-data based personal 
opinion, but there seem to 
be greater chances of attacks 
and assault. Students are a 
more vulnerable population. 
Adequate lighting helps with 
crime in any area, but greater 
things to focus on with home 
invasion would be to be educate 
students 
regarding 
proper 

practices.”

In response to the lack of 

lighting, a group of University 
students have created a petition 
to brighten the city’s streets. 
Titled “Bright Students Need 
Bright Lights,” the petition has 
gained 203 signatures thus far, 
and been posted in multiple 
University 
class 
Facebook 

groups.

The petition argues, “From 

a security point of view, light 
correlates with safety.”

One of the petition writers, 

LSA 
sophomore 
Jenna 

Jacobson, 
said 
insufficient 

street lighting affects Ann 
Arbor crime and a student’s 
day-to-day life.

“We are passionate about the 

lack of lighting in Ann Arbor, 
and are convinced that if there 
were better street lighting, 
there would be less crimes in 
Ann Arbor,” Jacobson wrote 
in an intervie with The Daily. 
“When going to study at night, 
students have to worry about 
how they are walking home 
and if they have friends to 
walk home with because of 
the poor lighting. I even have 
found myself walking home 
earlier than I wanted to from 
the library because of the 
poor lighting on campus. This 
has definitely impacted my 
studies.”

Poor lighting in Ann Arbor 

is not solely a student concern. 
Monday, the Ann Arbor City 
Council heard several residents 
express 
their 
concerns 

regarding pedestrian safety and 
street lights. Resident Kathy 
Griswold specifically argued 
for the safety of children at 
crosswalks.

“Will 
the 
2019 
budget 

include dollars for adequate 
illumination 
at 
all 
of 
our 

crosswalks given that we have 
new low-cost options with solar 
and LED?” Griswold asked.

Similarly, 
resident 
Eric 

Lipson 
expressed 
his 

frustration with the lack of 
lighting.

“No bureaucratic inertia is 

an excuse for losing a human 
life due to lack of public safety,” 
Lipson said.

According to Glick, the issue 

of street lighting seems to 
be a problem both off and on 
campus. 

“University grounds are not 

exempt from this problem,” 
Glick said. “For example on 
North Campus, when I have 
taken night classes on North 
Campus, I have noticed areas 
of darkness where the trees 
obscure the light.”

Though 
many 
citizens 

consider 
poor 
lighting 
to 

be the city’s responsibility, 
 

Grand said a partnership with 
the University could fix this 
problem.

“We continue to put more 

money into street lights in 
our budget and trying to find 
long-term sources of funding,” 
Grand said. “I would ideally 
love to see the University be 
a partner in how we fund our 
street lights, particularly the 
street lights that are in areas 
where students live. I don’t 
think it falls solely on the city. 
I would love to see this be a 
partnership between the city 
and the University, and I think 
students 
are 
an 
important 

voice in helping that process go 
forward.”

Jacobson 
and 
Glick 

both countered though the 
University could take a more 
active 
role 
in 
this 
issue, 

ultimately the problems falls 
heavily on the city.

“Legally, the lighting is the 

responsibility of the city and 
is a part of city maintenance,” 
Glick 
said. 
“Ethically, 
the 

governing 
bodies 
of 
the 

University take an integral role 
in the community.”

Looking forward, Glick says 

that he believes street lighting 
will continue to be an issue 
the SAC will seek to highlight, 
though it’s no longer a primary 
focus. Similarly, Grand says 
street lights will continue to be 
a priority for City Council.

The 
city 
has 
been 

continuously 
attempting 

to keep up with the safety 
concerns. In January 2017, 
the council voted to approve 
a$143,296 contract with OHM 
Advisers 
to 
take 
inventory 

of 
the 
city’s 
streetlights 

and determine the price for 
future repairs. Similarly, the 
city voted in 2015 to spend 
$200,000 on new streetlights 
for 
neighborhoods 
such 
as 

Hill Street, Oxford Road and 
Geddes Road.

Most recently, in a March 

12 budget meeting, Financial 
Services discussed increasing 
expenditures for street lighting, 
almost doubling the budget 
from $295,000 to $595,000. 
With this new budget, City 
Council could install about 30 
new streetlights a year.

management and policy professor 
and director of the Institute of 
Healthcare Policy and Innovation, 
illustrated his firsthand experience 
with patients and how they have 
benefitted from the increased 
access to care. He described 
patients who have gone five to 10 
years without care and are finally 
getting their chronic conditions 
treated. 
Despite 
its 
benefits, 

Ayanian also noted the rising prices 
of prescription drugs and how the 

ACA has not affected much change 
to slow the underlying cost growth.

“We have to come up with some 

better mechanism, particularly 
for paying for new breakthrough 
drugs that may benefit a small part 
of the population, but really can 
draw out control for public and 
private insurers,” Ayanian said.

In 
Nebraska, 
Cohn 
said, 

people receiving subsidies have 
little choice for coverage, and 
those above the subsidy line face 
prohibitive costs that force them 
into alternative health insurance 
options. 
These 
alternative 

options include Christian sharing 

ministries, which offer short-time 
care aimed to help between jobs. 
These loopholes are affordable 
but inefficient, and avoid federal 
insurance regulations the ACA was 
created to implement.

Wilensky 
explained 
citizens 

slightly above the poverty line 
get more subsidies than citizens 
with employer insurance, which 
she believes is unfair and leads to 
further instability.

“What can we do to try to 

stabilize these markets that will 
not be inherently unfair to the 
people right above them, or right 
beside them?” Wilensky asked.

Ayanian differentiated between 

health care and health insurance, 
explaining the ACA was aimed 
to reform health insurance, not 
health care. However, he stressed 
the importance of integrating 
health care and social services, 
arguing the U.S. is spending too 
much on health care services and 
not enough on social services to 
actually implement an increased 
access to health care.

“We’re not getting the value 

for the dollars we spend on health 
care,” Ayanian said.

Lantz asked the group what the 

one policy problem surrounding 

the ACA would they fix.

Ayanian 
again 
highlighted 

expanding 
Medicaid 
in 
the 

18 states that have not yet 
implemented the ACA, as it 
would help millions of people 
with chronic illnesses. Cohn 
and Wilensky focused on the 
inequities brought about by the 
subsidy distribution, and how 
it is arguably a root cause of the 
instability brought about by the 
ACA. Cohn specifically suggested 
making the subsidies bigger and 
more generous, while Wilensky 
suggested focusing on horizontal 
and vertical equity. 

At a Ford panel on the same 

topic last Februrary, students said 
they appreciated frank disucssion. 
LSA freshman Kieran Byrne said 
he wanted to cut through media 
portrayals 
of 
the 
healthcare 

debate. 

“I think it’s important that 

people have a good idea of 
what’s going on in terms of the 
legislation that’s going to happen 
and what laws are already doing 
for us,” he said. “I think a lot of 
news and information is very 
sensationalized and it’s important 
to hear from the people who 
actually have an impact.”

We can’t just Passover Palestine

 ALONA HENIG | OP-ED

CARLY BEHRENDT | CONTACT CARLY AT CARBEHR@UMICH.EDU

 BRETT GRAHAM | COLUMN

P

assover is a holiday of 
liberation, retelling the 
story of Jewish slaves 

in Egypt and their exodus. We 
use food to symbolize different 
parts of the story: maror to 
remind us of the bitterness of 
slavery; charoset to represent 
the mortar used to build the 
pyramids; karpas to celebrate the 
welcoming of spring and new life 
with salt water to reminds us of 
our ancestors’ tears; and matzah 
to remind us of the rush of the 
exodus as the bread didn’t have 
time to rise — eat that for a week 
and you’ll be newly grateful for 
any yeast you can find.

Once we were slaves in 

Egypt. Now, we sit together 
and remember our ancestors’ 
hardships and give thanks to the 
freedom we’ve found.

Passover 
is 
one 
of 
my 

favorite holidays, because it is 
always relevant; Jews have been 
persecuted for centuries, and 
anti-Semitism is still alive and 
well. That said, many others 
have been and continue to be 
persecuted, and our suffering 
is 
neither 
more 
important 

nor severe than anyone else’s. 
Yesterday, just hours before 
the first night of Passover, 14 
Palestinians were killed and 
more than 750 wounded by 
Israeli fire on the border of Gaza 
during a Palestinian protest. Just 
hours before the seders began, 
soldiers were dropping tear gas 
over countless civilians fighting 
for the same cause we fought for 
— freedom and liberation.

There are layers upon layers 

of complexity in this issue, 
as 
historical, 
religious 
and 

emotional stakes are very high. 
Similarly, leaving Egypt was no 
small feat and the stakes then 
were very high — that’s why we 
celebrate the story and remember 
it so vividly. Yet on this holiday, 

we continue to violently oppress 
an entire people. Gaza has been 
under an Israeli blockade since 
2007, severely limiting human 
travel and cutting them off 
from medical supplies, food, 
electricity and more.

As Jews, we know the 

importance 
of 
resistance 

and resilience, and if we’ve 
forgotten, this timely holiday is 
here to remind us. So why this 
double standard? Why was our 
fight for freedom, which was 
violent and cruel (a commanded 
killing of a newly born child is 
never warranted), something 
to celebrate while a Palestinian 
protest is something we feel the 
need to suppress? Why is Jewish 
liberation more important than 
that of Palestinians’? It’s not.

My 
grandfather 
was 

a 
Holocaust 
survivor. 
He 

survived a mass genocide of 
his people, and he moved to 
Israel. My family is in Israel. 
My parents are from Israel. I 
identify with Israel. So why is 
this country that is supposed 
to be a safe haven for Jews 
treating others the way we were 
treated? When we think back to 
the tragedies that took so many 
Jewish lives, we say, “Never 
again.” But we turn a blind 
eye to Israel’s oppressive and 
abusive behavior and continue 
to celebrate it without question. 
It’s time to wake up and ask 
these questions!

I am proud of my heritage 

and culture, but how can this 
country that is supposed to 
represent that be so cruel?

I know I will hear arguments 

about the Palestinians starting 
it and throwing stones and 
this and that — I’ve heard it 
all before. But ask yourselves, 
why do children feel the need 
to throw stones? Why are they 
so afraid of an Israeli soldier? 

Is it because they lost a family 
member to the blow of one of 
their guns? It very well could 
be.

As Jews, we understand 

suffering 
and 
displacement. 

We know the hardships of 
being driven from our homes 
and fighting with nothing to 
lose. So where is our empathy? 
Palestinians, 
especially 
in 

Gaza, have been oppressed and 
dehumanized for decades. It’s on 
us to understand the hardships 
that have caused the oppression 
and work to make it better. It’s 
on us to meet Palestinians where 
they are, because if our history 
has taught us anything, it’s 
empathy in suffering.

Israel’s 
oppression 
and 

violence is not acceptable, and 
as Jews we have a responsibility 
to say that out loud. Israel’s 
actions are shameful and not 
reflective of our culture and 
history. It doesn’t need to be 
this way, but it is, and we can’t 
ignore that.

So on Passover, as you eat 

your charoset and drink your 
wine, as you remember the 
10 plagues and sing Dayenu, 
sing it for those in Palestine 
who are no longer able to sing 
themselves. Sing it for the lives 
lost to violent military control 
and do something to change the 
story. We need to question and 
criticize Israel if we care about a 
fair and just Jewish nation.

On 
April 
19, 
some 
will 

celebrate Yom Ha’atzmaut, or 
Israeli Independence Day. On 
that day, take pleasure in how 
good it feels to be liberated 
and remember that everyone 
deserves that sense of freedom. 
It’s time to free Palestine.

Pod hold the partisanship

Activism through good food

B

y all accounts, it was a 
pretty standard October 
Saturday. 
Michigan 

football was playing in a few 
hours and I stood on a friend’s 
lawn near the corner of State and 
Hoover streets, watching with a 
red Solo cup in hand as hordes 
of people decked out in maize 
and blue passed by. Then, I saw 
a familiar face in the crowd. And 
then two more just behind it. 
“Friend of the Pod!” I shouted. 
“Friend of the Pod here, can I get 
a picture?”

Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor 

and Dan Pfeiffer were passing 
by on their way to the game, 
having taped an episode of their 
extremely popular podcast “Pod 
Save America” in the Michigan 
Theater the night before. It might 
be hard to believe for some, but 
these former President Barack 
Obama staffers have gained a 
huge amount of celebrity since 
their time in the White House. 
Their podcast reaches about 1.5 
million listeners per episode and 
their live shows sell out theaters 
across the country. They have 
interviewed nearly every major 
candidate for Congress and the 
presidency in 2018 and 2020, 
respectively.

On specs, for progressives 

and liberals at least, the success of 
their company, Crooked Media, 
and its growing list of podcasts 
is cause for celebration — finally, 
an answer to conservative talk 
radio and Fox News! Young 
liberal voices are helping the 
average American contextualize 
the hot mess of current events 
in the President Donald Trump 
era and stay informed. Still, 
long-time 
listeners 
(such 
as 

yours truly) have observed a 
certain shift in tone over the 
past few months that makes me 
think I would not have such an 
enthusiastic reaction if I were 
to see them walking around Ann 
Arbor today.

Co-hosts 
Favreau, 
Vietor, 

Pfeiffer and Jon Lovett, a former 
speech-writer and funnyman, 
have spent hours and hours 
discussing the state of the 
Democratic Party. They have 
rehashed the 2016 primary and 
the relationship between the 
so-called Hillary Clinton and 
Bernie Sander wings. They have 
parsed apart the party’s position 
on health care, immigration 
and gun control to find the most 
progressive or most sensible 
stance. They have interviewed 
countless experts, trying to 
understand how to best fight the 
Trump presidency. They used 
to plainly criticize a number of 
high-profile Democrats. As the 
2018 midterms have approached, 
though, the Pod is sounding 
more and more like a partisan 
rallying cry than the serious 
autopsy that it once was.

I first got this feeling in the 

wake of the Alabama special 
election in December. Obviously, 
Republican 
candidate 
Roy 

Moore’s loss is something to 
celebrate, 
and 
a 
Democrat 

winning that seat goes a long way 
toward liberal politics returning 
to the South. But Democratic 
Sen. Doug Jones is and always 
has been a strong supporter of 
the Second Amendment. He does 
not support single-payer health 
care, which is now enjoying 
almost 
universal 
(no 
pun 

intended) support from liberals 
and 
progressives. 
He 
even 

once celebrated a Confederate 
colonel. He will face a tough 
re-election campaign in 2020, 
and anyone who expects him 
to be a consistent and reliable 
liberal vote in the Senate is 
naïve; he will be looking for 
every opportunity to work with 
his Republican colleagues.

And yet, listening to “Pod 

Save America,” you hear very few 
– if any – of these caveats. None 
of this context. “Someone with 

a (D) next to his name on the 
ballot won, so let’s celebrate!” 
they seemed to say. Now, as the 
midterms approach, listeners 
hear regularly how important it 
is to elect Democrats nationwide 
in November. I would agree, 
with 
one 
slight 
adjustment. 

It is important to elect the 
right Democrats in November. 
Progressive, non-corporate ones 
with vision. A roster of Doug 
Joneses is not going to cut it.

To a certain extent, no one 

can really blame them. They 
are all partisan Democratic 
operatives, not journalists. They 
do not pretend to offer any sort 
of unbiased perspective.

What is worrisome to me is 

that their audience is comprised 
of 
thoughtful, 
progressive 

people who now rely on “Pod 
Save America” for information 
and context. These people are 
looking to mobilize and can 
change the fundamentals of the 
party if given the chance. They 
could 
become 
an 
informed, 

motivated, progressive base that 
not only helps win elections but 
keeps its politicians honest. This 
is only if it is an ideological, 
and skeptical base rather than a 
partisan and impressionable one.

At the end of the day, I’ll 

continue to listen to “Lovett or 
Leave It” regularly and “Pod Save 
America” on occasion. Crooked 
Media as a whole employs 
progressive voices from people 
of color and women (Symone 
Sanders, DeRay Mckesson, Ira 
Madison III) and they deserve 
commendation for that. To my 
fellow listeners, though, a word 
of warning — stay vigilant. This 
podcast is no longer what it was 
and may be transitioning into 
something less than appealing.

T

he Lunch Room didn’t 
start with a business plan 
or a value proposition. 

Instead, it started with two 
neighbors cooking food together 
in their kitchens. After eight 
years, three brick-and-mortar 
locations and success beyond 
what 
anyone 
could 
have 

predicted, its origin story isn’t 
hard to believe. Step inside any 
of The Lunch Room’s three 
locations and you’ll instantly feel 
like you’re at home having a meal 
with your family. The Lunch 
Room emanates a casual, almost 
hippie-like vibe, with meals that 
taste home-cooked and posters 
on the wall promoting The Lunch 
Room’s social activism with the 
Youth Justice Fund. In a city 
like Ann Arbor, perhaps those 
qualities alone could account 
for its incredible success as a 
restaurant.

But Joel Panozzo, co-founder 

and co-owner of The Lunch Room, 
hopes his restaurant’s success is 
due to more than just its location in 
a notoriously community-focused, 
activism-centric city.

“I’ve been wanting to think 

that it’s possible for businesses to 
do the things that we’re doing, even 
not in Ann Arbor,” Panozzo said in 
an interview at The Lunch Room’s 
Kerrytown location. “That’s what 
my personal longer-term goal is — 
to be an example that a restaurant 
can do these things. A restaurant 
can pay its employees a livable 
wage, it can provide health and 
dental benefits, it can provide gym 
membership reimbursements, it 
can farm its own vegetables, it can 
work with formerly incarcerated 
adults, it can work with people 
recovering in the community, 
regardless of what town you live in. 
It helps that a community like Ann 
Arbor identifies with those things, 
but I’m hoping that it grows further 
from there.”

Panozzo’s sentiment may be 

more controversial than it initially 
sounds; how many diners do you 
know that pay their employees a 
livable wage? However, it seems to 
be working for The Lunch Room. 
This past summer, The Lunch 
Room opened its third location, 

Detroit Street Filling Station, which 
is right across the street from its 
original location in Kerrytown.

“You’ve probably seen what it’s 

like when (The Lunch Room) gets 
super busy and there’s a line down 
the hallway,” Panozzo said. (For 
the record, I have seen The Lunch 
Room that busy, just about every 
time I’ve been there). “It turned 
into be an issue. I would run into 
our regulars on the street and be 
like, ‘Oh my gosh, I haven’t seen you 
in so long, what’s been going on?’ 
And they’d be like, ‘Yeah, I don’t 
come anymore cause it’s so busy, it’s 
crazy.’”

Not many restaurants have 

this 
problem, 
and 
Panozzo 

acknowledged “it’s a good problem 
to have, but it’s still a problem.” 
When space opened up across the 
street, Panozzo and his co-owner, 
Phillis 
Engelbert, 
immediately 

jumped on it.

What put The Lunch Room in a 

position to be so successful that it was 
forced to open another location? It 
appears that Panozzo and Engelbert 
don’t view most of their decisions 
as business decisions, but rather as 
opportunities to provide the highest 
quality of service. First and foremost, 
this means good food. The Lunch 
Room is an all-vegan restaurant, 
meaning it doesn’t use meat, eggs or 
dairy (like cheese) in any of its menu 
items. According to Panozzo, this 
isn’t to hit the niche market of vegans 
in Ann Arbor. Rather, it allows them 
to create the highest quality of dishes 
that other restaurants may not be 
capable of creating.

“When you are using really 

heavy creams and cheeses and 
animal fats, it can kind of mask a 
lot of the other things that you have 
going on in your food,” Panozzo 
explained. “When you’re using 
entirely plant-based ingredients, 
it’s like an opportunity to find other 
spices, herbs, crazy vegetables. It’s 
an opportunity to actually make 
something that hits a flavor palette 
that somebody has maybe never 
tasted before. Or a flavor palette 
that could be there, but then it’s got 
melted cheese is all over the top.”

The 
Lunch 
Room 
doesn’t 

hesitate to give back to its 
community. Recently, The Lunch 

Room began a partnership with the 
Youth Justice Fund, a nonprofit that 
works with formerly incarcerated 
youth in the Ann Arbor area.

“That kind of grew out of a 

separate program that we were 
running,” Panozzo said.

The Lunch Room used to 

have a 10 percent giving program, 
where each month it promoted a 
particular nonprofit. On Saturday 
nights, 
the 
nonprofit 
would 

advertise The Lunch Room to 
its donors and employees, and 10 
percent of the restaurant’s sales 
would go to that nonprofit. Over 
time, The Lunch Room used this 
program to partner with local 
prisoner-rights 
attorneys 
and 

create the Youth Justice Fund.

This form of charity appears 

to be a no-brainer for Panozzo. 
When I ask him to explain it 
further, 
he 
emphasizes 
the 

need for such a nonprofit in 
the 
community, 
rather 
than 

explaining why it helps The Lunch 
Room as a business. This attitude 
is characteristic of Panozzo; he 
views The Lunch Room as an 
opportunity to make the right 
life decisions, not necessarily 
the right business decisions. The 
business success follows, almost 
as an afterthought.

As for long-term goals, Panozzo 

doesn’t plan on expanding any 
further. “I imagine us starting to 
work more on an advocacy level, 
where my business partner and I 
would start stepping out and maybe 
teaching other businesses how to 
do what we’re doing,” he said. “It’s 
great that we’ve been able to do 
the three places that we have been 
able to do, but like I don’t think 
more locations is like necessarily 
… we’re feeling very content with 
the amount of craziness that three 
locations entails.”

As for Panozzo, The Lunch 

Room is still the place that he began 
cooking in his neighbor’s kitchen 
back in 2008.

“Yesterday, I was cooking on 

the line for like eight hours,” he said 
with a laugh. “It would be nice to 
just step back a little bit.”

The Daily makes its predictions for Michigan and the Frozen Four

Frozen Four?
Frozen Four.
A very long time ago, the Big 

Ten 
Preseason 
Coaches’ 
Poll 

predicted a sixth-place finish for 
the Michigan hockey team. The 
Wolverines needed a while to 
shrug off those projections, but 
thanks to a second-half push, they 
did just that and more, storming 
into the national semifinal for the 
first time since 2011.

That year was also the last time 

the Frozen Four was played in St. 
Paul, and coincidentally, three of 
the four teams in this year’s field 
— Michigan, Minnesota-Duluth 
and Notre Dame — were there 
in 2011. Ohio State, making its 
first appearance since 1998, is an 
outlier in this regard only. The 
Buckeyes are one of three Big Ten 
teams, along with the Wolverines 
and Fighting Irish, in this year’s 
Frozen Four.

On Thursday, the Wolverines 

will face Notre Dame for the fifth 
time this year, and should they win, 
a familiar face will await them for 
the national championship. Either 
it will be their fiercest rival, Ohio 
State, which dealt them five losses 
during the regular season, or 
they’ll take on Minnesota-Duluth, 
which beat them in overtime for 
the 2011 national title. Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson, then an 
assistant under Red Berenson, has 
said that the loss still sticks with 
him.

Seven 
years 
later, 
the 

Wolverines are back in the Land 
of 10,000 Lakes, looking to make 
up for the heartbreak of 2011. 
The Daily’s hockey beat writers 
predict if they will do so:

Jacob Shames
Prediction: Michigan
Mel Pearson said last week 

that Michigan is “happy to be (in 
the Frozen Four),” and is playing 
“bonus hockey.” It’s the sentiment 
of a coach whose team wasn’t 
expected to even approach St. Paul 
this season, let alone the NCAA 
Tournament.

But now that the Wolverines 

are here? They might just mess 
around and win the whole damn 
thing.

Despite 
scares 
against 

Michigan Tech and Providence 
in the regional round, Notre 
Dame — with its Hobey Baker 
finalist 
goaltender, 
disciplined 

defense and balanced offense 
— is every bit as good as its No. 1 
seed indicates. But Michigan has 
defeated the Fighting Irish twice, 
and played them dead-even in two 
losses in January, outshooting 
them 70-63. Out of Notre Dame’s 
six goals against the Wolverines 
this year, only one of them came 
from five-on-five play. Michigan 
is fully capable of creating scoring 
chances against the Fighting 
Irish’s defense, and as long as it 
plays most of the game at even 
strength, this game is effectively a 
toss-up. In a low-scoring tussle, I 
think the Wolverines can sneak a 
couple past Cale Morris — at least 
enough to win.

Ohio State — which should 

handle Minnesota-Duluth in the 
other semifinal — averages more 
and allows fewer goals per game 
than Notre Dame. The Buckeyes 
laid waste to Denver — the 
defending national champion — 
in the regional final, and in five 
meetings with them this season, 
Michigan has yet to win. But in the 
teams’ most recent matchup, the 
Wolverines fell to Ohio State in an 
overtime contest that was even in 
just about every way. Michigan’s 
lost only once since Feb. 9, and it 
came that night in Columbus.

For my money, the Buckeyes 

are the best team in the country. 
But with the Wolverines’ rapid 
improvement over the last two 
months — as well as Ohio State 
being without third-leading scorer 
Matthew Weis due to injury — 
there’s no reason that they can’t 
beat the Buckeyes once, short of 
being cursed to never defeat them 
again. In an unpredictable NCAA 
Tournament that saw two No. 
1 seeds fall in their first game, I 
predict the title game will follow 
suit, and Michigan will raise a 
championship banner at Yost Ice 
Arena next season.

Benjamin Katz
Prediction: Michigan
Almost two weeks ago, I wrote 

about 
the 
20th 
anniversary 

of the 1998 Michigan hockey 
national 
championship 
team 

and its eerie similarity to today’s 
Wolverines headed into the NCAA 
Tournament.

“Maybe this team won’t have 

the same success,” it read. “But the 
parallels can’t be ignored.”

Akin to 1998, this Wolverine 

team is the decided underdog, 
staring straight in the face of Notre 
Dame with slim expectations 
directed their way. Win and 
advance to battle thunderous Ohio 
State or Minnesota-Duluth. Like 
two decades ago, Michigan needs 
to embrace dogged, nothing-to-
lose motivation to win its 10th 
National Championship in 25 
Frozen Four attempts.

It’ll do just that.
Don’t get me wrong — navigating 

the Fighting Irish, arguably the 
best team on paper, is an arduous 
task. But the Wolverines’ last 
series against them shows its 
immense improvement as the 
season progressed and ability to 
rattle Morris early and often. On 
Feb. 16 in South Bend, Michigan 
outshot Notre Dame, 17-6, in 
the first period on the way to a 
4-2 win. It was the Wolverines’ 
best-played period all season. 
Fast starts and holding leads 
continued, as they never trailed 
against Northeastern and Boston 
University in the Regional rounds. 
I don’t see this trend stopping 
against Notre Dame.

Then there’s a date against Ohio 

State or Minnesota-Duluth. With 
the former more likely to advance 
to the national championship, 
college sports’ foremost rivalry 
would again be on display.

The Buckeyes may be America’s 

most well-rounded team. They 
allow just 2.08 goals per game, 
succeeds on 89.29 percent of 
penalty kills and, with boasts 

a lethal first line of Tanner 
Laczynski, 
Mason 
Jobst 
and 

Freddy Gerard. While goaltender 
Sean Romeo may not be Morris, 
he’s been highly reliable down the 
stretch with dramatic saves late in 
games.

After being outscored, 17-6, in 

their first four contents against 
Ohio State and losing their 
fifth, 3-2, in overtime of the Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
semifinals, 

Michigan won’t be embarrassed 
again.

Secondary 
scoring 
from 

freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 

Hughes and sophomore forwards 
Jake Slaker and Nick Pastujov 
— and solid netminding from 
sophomore Hayden Lavigne — 
will propel the Wolverines to 
college hockey’s apex, where 
not even the most optimistic 
prognosticator expected them to 
reside this season.

Anna Marcus
Prediction: Ohio State
Michigan 
has 
positioned 

itself right where it wanted to 
be this season. The Wolverines 
will be well-acquainted with 
their Thursday night opponent 
in St. Paul. Seeing Notre Dame 
— the Big Ten conference and 
tournament champion — for the 
fifth time this season actually 
looks like it could be a good thing 
for Michigan.

Rankings-wise, the Fighting 

Irish look like the clear favorite. 
They’ve also been either at the 
top of the nation or just under 
it all season. But judging by all 
four of the previous meetings 
this season, the Wolverines have 
played right there with them — or 
better. Michigan has a significant 
offensive edge, averaging 3.41 
goals per game compared to Notre 
Dame’s 2.95. In fact, in all of their 
contests this season, the Fighting 
Irish haven’t shot more than 
two pucks past Hayden Lavigne. 
Of course, it is impossible not 
to recognize Cale Morris and 
his .945 save percentage, but 
the Wolverines proved twice in 
February that they can evade him 
enough times to pull off a win.

In 
the 
press 
conference 

following 
the 
regional, 
Mel 

Pearson noted that he “liked the 
matchup” with Notre Dame. His 
team should, too. And I believe 
Pearson’s squad will see a spot in 
the championship game.

Michigan then will find itself 

in familiar conference company 
— squaring off against Ohio State 
for a sixth time. The Buckeyes 
made a takedown of Denver look 

easy in the Midwest Regional, 
and shouldn’t have too much 
trouble doing the same with 
Minnesota-Duluth.

But once the Wolverines get 

there, they will fall short of a 
national title. It’s safe to say that 
Michigan wants to avenge its five 
losses thus far this season to Ohio 
State. And while that sentiment 
should not be underestimated, 
the Buckeyes are just too good, 
plain and simple. None of the 
Wolverines’ five losses to Ohio 
State, other than the Big Ten 
Tournament 
semifinal, 
were 

even particularly close. Thinking 
about capitalizing on a power 
play? The Buckeyes probably 
won’t let it happen. They run the 
best penalty kill in the nation, 
preventing goals over 89 percent 
of the time. And Michigan scored 
just once with a man-advantage 
when playing them.

In a season where no one but 

Michigan itself predicted that it 
would land a spot in St. Paul, the 

Wolverines will prove everyone 
wrong by making it to the final 
game of the year. But Ohio State 
will take it all.

Robert Hefter
Prediction: Who knows?
In the beginning of the year, 

if you’d asked anyone if the 
Wolverines would be in the 
Frozen Four, they would have 
told you off with good reason. 
In the second week in January, 
Michigan was swept by Notre 
Dame — a series no one expected 
the Wolverines to take.

The Fighting Irish boasted 

one of the better defenses in 
the country with the nation’s 
best goaltender. After 2-1 losses 
both nights, many commended 
Michigan for its fortitude in 
a 
powerhouse 
matchup. 
But 

that 
commemoration 
was 

representative of an underlying 
storyline at play. The truth 
was that, after the Notre Dame 
defeats, no one expected the 
Wolverines to get over the hump 

of securing victories against the 
nation’s best.

That all changed the next 

weekend.

Michigan went on a four-game 

win-streak against top-15 teams 
in Minnesota and Penn State. It 
didn’t look back.

A newly diversified attacking 

arm 
consisting 
of 
veteran 

offensive performers such as 
junior Cooper Marody and senior 
Tony Calderone supplemented 
by the likes of sophomore Jake 
Slaker, freshman Jack Becker 
and others now defined the squad 
poised for a postseason run. But 
they’ll certainly face a challenge 
with the battle-tested Fighting 
Irish defense headed by Jordan 
Gross and Cale Morris.

One thing is for sure, though, 

Notre Dame seems to be playing 
the same hockey now that it was 
at the beginning of the season 
— steady defense with slow, 
calculated 
offensive 
pressure. 

On the other hand, Michigan 
is clearly playing with more 
confidence and it has shown 
in its impressive, unpredicted 
postseason performance. With 
Calderone and Marody at the 
reins 
with 
supplementary 

bombardment 
from 
the 

Wolverines’ depth, Morris won’t 
be able to stop the Michigan 
offensive train unless he conjures 
up Brodeur-esque style.

In 
the 
other 
matchup 
— 

Ohio State against Minnesota-
Duluth — both teams happen 
to be quite similar. Both have 
outstanding power plays. Both 
are defined by a stalwart back 
line. And much like the media 
has hinted at for the past week 
and a half, the Wolverines will 
meet the Buckeyes in the national 
championship to duke it out for 
the sixth time this season.

Just like the first six matchups, 

though, Ohio State’s penalty kill 
paired with its deadly offense 
headlined by Tanner Laczynski 
and Mason Jobst could be too 
much. But Michigan has since 
built a reputation as a fast, 
scrappy team since the two’s last 
faceoff in the Big Ten semifinal.

My guess, it’s up for grabs.

Martin sisters enjoy success on the field but strive for a better game

In observance of March’s 

Women’s History Month, The 
Daily launched a series aimed 
at telling the stories of female 
athletes, coaches and teams 
at the University from the 
perspective of the female sports 
writers on staff. Daily sports 
writer Jodi Yip continued the 
series with this story.

Competing 
on 
the 
same 

collegiate soccer team has been 
an amazing journey for siblings 
Alia and Reilly Martin.

The Martin sisters’ story 

began when Reilly was five 
years old and Alia was three. 
Their mother had just signed 
Reilly up for a league called 
Little Kicker and asked the 
coach 
whether 
her 
other 

daughter 
— 
who 
was 
two 

years younger — could also 
participate. The coach gave a 
response that ultimately lead 
the Martins to where they are 
today.

“If she can stand in line and 

not throw a tantrum, then 
(Alia) is welcome to join.”

Fast forward 16 years. The 

Martin sisters are back at it 
again and competing on the 
same team. This time, however, 
is different. Instead of lining 
up without crying as their sole 
responsibility, they are now 
competing for championships 
and public recognition.

This year, Michigan was 

formally introduced to Alia 
and Reilly Martin — the blood-
related superstars hailing from 
Carmel, Indiana, the sisters 
who bleed maize and blue.

Reilly is currently a junior 

enrolled 
in 
the 
School 
of 

Kinesiology 
majoring 
in 

psychology. 
The 
list 
of 

accolades is extensive. She’s 
been awarded Big Ten All-
Freshman Team (2015), All-Big 
Ten second team (2016), All-Big 
Ten third team (2017) honors.

Reilly’s counterpart, Alia, is 

a freshman in LSA. When Alia 

was in high school, she was 
ranked No. 36 overall and the 
No. 14 midfielder in the Class 
of 2017 by Top Drawer Soccer. 
She was also named Gatorade 
Indiana Girls Soccer Player of 
the Year in 2015.

In high school, the Martins 

did not give much thought 
about playing on the same 
collegiate team. When Alia 
was being scouted by colleges, 
Reilly was already committed 
to Michigan. Though family 
was a big factor in her decision, 
Alia did not allow her sister’s 
soccer career to determine 
where she would play for the 
next four years.

“You don’t only look at what 

other people are influencing 
you to do,” said Alia. “You look 
at what you want to do as well. 
This school, in general, is a great 
school. Nobody wants to think 
this way but if you were to get 

injured, where would you still 
want to be if you couldn’t play?”

It is not a shocker that both 

sisters chose the Wolverines. 
Michigan’s academic reputation 
coupled with the competitive 
atmosphere and the overall 
feel of the women’s soccer 
team convinced both Reilly and 
Alia that Wolverines were the 
perfect match.

When 
asked 
about 
their 

experience of going to the same 
school, Alia laughed about their 
lack of contact during a regular 
school day.

“We have this joke that we 

don’t see each other so much,” 
Alia said. “We train at different 
places. (Reilly) would train as a 
forward and I would train as a 
defender. We would be split up 
with two different coaches. We 
really would not see each other 
too frequently in the day.”

But when it comes to playing 

together on the same field, their 
chemistry is unmatchable.

“We have this connection on 

the field,” Alia said. “I would 
always look for her as she would 
with me. I am very familiar 
with her style, and we play to 
those strengths because we are 
familiar with each other.”

Occasionally, there are times 

of 
miscommunication 
and 

frustration on the field, but 
there is no “bad blood” mixed in 
the Martin family line. Instead 
of 
competing 
against 
each 

other, the sisters are constantly 
pushing each other to improve 
together.

“It’s always the next thing, 

what can we do from here,” 
Reilly 
said. 
“We’ve 
really 

grown to be the best we can be.”

***
While the Martin sisters 

have grown as individuals and 
improved 
athletically, 
they 

believe the women’s soccer 
team still has a long way to go.

The 
program 
has 
been 

running since 1994, but the 
average attendance of a home 
game plateaus at around 860. 
On the other hand, the men’s 
soccer team regularly welcomes 
large crowds including a sellout 
crowd of 2,637 at its matchup 
with Michigan State.

It is a common subconscious 

decision for people to root for 
men’s 
sports 
over 
women’s 

sports. 
Though 
Michigan 

provides 
student 
athletes 

with the same opportunities 
— 
including 
weight 
rooms, 

training rooms and athletic 
staff members — the women’s 
teams are underrepresented in 
media and public support.

“It gets frustrating,” Reilly 

said. “You do what you can on 
the field, you put in the work 
and you hope to get recognized 

for whatever you are doing.

“You put in as much time 

as the men’s team, you train 
as hard and you focus just as 
much.”

The 
Martin 
sisters 
have 

seen first-hand the lack of 
recognition 
female 
athletes 

receive. But Reilly is passionate 
about change through self-
improvement.

“One of my big things is 

that you don’t settle to be 
disrespected if someone treats 
you differently because you 
are a woman athlete,” Reilly 
said. “As a team, we do a good 
job to push ourselves to expect 
the same standards as a male 
player. You need to focus on 
what is in your control.”

Both the Martins were highly 

recruited in high school to play 
at prestigious colleges, but 
the sisters are still relatively 
unknown, proving that the 
perception of women’s sports 
as equal to men’s is a work in 
progress.

But there seems to be a 

glimmer of hope for Wolverine 
sports. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 

Jennifer Klein was named the 
new head coach of the women’s 
soccer program replacing Greg 
Ryan. A new female voice 
can bring about the change 
in leadership that Michigan 
soccer has so greatly sought 
after.

“The new transition has to 

do with taking what people 
say into consideration and not 
blowing it off,” Reilly said. 
“What Michigan stands for is 
respecting women’s athletes 
and voices.”

It 
will 
be 
a 
slow 
and 

gradual process to change the 
perception of women in sports 
and recognize they possess the 
same competition and athletic 
capabilities as men in sports.

But recognized or not, the 

Martins’ list of accomplishments 
keeps growing. Gender equality 
in sports has yet to come, but 
hopefully the Martin sisters will 
be around the experience it.

ROBERT BUECHLER/Daily

Junior forward Reilly Martin and her sister, Alia, have enjoyed success on the field in their time at Michigan, but they hope for a better future in women’s sports.

Daily Sports Writer

Set for Frozen Four, Wolverines look back at January turning point

It all started with Notre 

Dame.

According to Mel Pearson, 

the first time the the Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 
spark 
really 

ignited was the first weekend 
in January — the weekend of 
its first series against the then 
top-ranked Fighting Irish.

On 
paper, 
it 
may 
not 

have looked like much. The 
Wolverines lost both of those 
games, 2-1. But the headlines 
that read a Fighting Irish 
“sweep” didn’t necessarily tell 
the full story of the weekend. 
Michigan knew it had still done 
something big.

“You 
know, 
Notre 
Dame 

had been one or two all year,” 
Pearson said Wednesday at a 
press conference in St. Paul, 
Minn. “And I think that series, 
you saw some things that our 
coaches, okay, maybe we have 
a chance. If we play like we did 
this weekend, we got a chance 
to win every game we play.”

That message clearly seemed 

to 
stick. 
The 
Wolverines 

went on to win 10 of their 
remaining 14 regular season 
games throughout January and 
February. That included sweeps 
of then-No. 9 Minnesota, then-
No. 12 Penn State, and the 
largest of them all — a 4-2, 1-0 
sweep of the still-No.1 Fighting 
Irish.

It all started with Notre 

Dame, and for Michigan, the 
final destination it dreamed of 
— the Frozen Four — will see 
its growth come full circle. For 
the fifth time this season, the 
Wolverines (22-14-3) will face 
off against the Fighting Irish 
(27-9-2), this time at the Xcel 
Energy Center in St. Paul on the 
biggest stage of the season.

Given the teams’ familiarity, 

they know the most threatening 
aspects of their opponents’ 
game.

For Notre Dame, look no 

further 
than 
the 
blueline. 

The Fighting Irish give up 
a miniscule 2.19 goals per 

game, which can be credited 
to the combination of a high-
functioning defensive zone and 
absurd goaltending.

“I 
think 
their 
defensive 

zone is incredible,” said senior 
forward Tony Calderone. “They 
make it really hard for us to get 
to the middle of the ice. And 
as long as we can get there, 
sacrifice and get some shots on 
net, get some rebounds, I think 
we’ll be okay.”

Notre 
Dame’s 
goaltender 

— Cale Morris — is one of 
the 
most 
highly-acclaimed 

players in collegiate hockey. 
This season, the sophomore 
was recognized as Big Ten 
Player and Goaltender of the 
Year, a Hobey Baker Finalist 
and was named to the All-Big 
Ten First Team. Morris’ .945 
save percentage has greatly 

helped the Fighting Irish, who 
don’t run a particularly flashy 
offense. 

Almost 
in 
polarity, 
one 

of the Wolverines’ greatest 
strengths lies in 
the offense. Led 
by 
Calderone 

and his junior 
linemate Cooper 
Marody, 
the 

offensive 
unit 

averages 
3.41 

goals per game. 
When 
just 

looking at the 
postseason, 
this 
number 

spikes, as three out of four 
of Michigan’s wins after the 
regular season have seen six or 
more pucks in the net.

But 
again, 
these 
things 

should not come as a surprise 

to either team. And with 
the record split at 2-2, the 
outcome will likely come down 
to whether the Wolverines 
can successfully crack Notre 

Dame’s defense 
like 
they 

did 
during 

February’s 
series.

This 

familiarity 
is 

not 
generally 

a 
common 

sentiment 
this 

late 
in 
the 

season. 
Last 

year, 
not 
a 

single Big Ten team was in the 
Frozen Four. Now, three of the 
four teams left standing are 
members of the conference.

And Michigan was quick 

to acknowledge not only how 

big of a feat it is for the Big 
Ten to claim these spots, but 
how beneficial it has been to 
compete all season in a strong 
conference.

“I think it’s huge for the 

league,” Calderone said. “I have 
been here for four years. The Big 
Ten wasn’t nearly as good my 
first three. It’s been incredible 
seeing the improvement over 
the years.

“And I think it’s great for 

us, too, playing in the Big Ten 
because it’s prepared us. We’ve 
played these teams so many 
times and I think it’s great. It’s 
really exciting to see it move 
forward.”

Leaving the January series 

against 
Notre 
Dame, 
the 

Wolverines were under .500. 
It’s safe to say at that point, 
the Frozen Four, let alone 

the NCAA Tournament was 
nowhere in sight. But that 
weekend, Michigan was able 
to play up to the caliber of the 
Fighting Irish, which catalyzed 
a transition for the Wolverines. 
As the season moved forward, 
Michigan became a team that 
could hang with the best. Now, 
the Wolverines are one of the 
best. 

“That weekend really showed 

us something,” Pearson said. 
“And we went into Minnesota 
and had a good weekend. Penn 
State came to Yost. We swept 
them. At that point, things 
started to come together.”

And 
Michigan 
will 
see 

Thursday if all the tweaks it 
has made over the past three 
months are enough to get past 
Notre Dame — just one more 
time.

First series against Notre Dame showed the potential of what Michigan was capable of accomplishing in the future

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Senior forward Tony Calderone says he believes the Ohio State, Notre Dame and Michigan hockey teams’ participation in the Frozen Four is “huge” for the Big Ten and an incredible improvement. 

“You know, 
Notre Dame 

had been one or 

two all year.”

Advocating for disability and inclusion in the arts

The 
presenting 
theme 
of 

the arts in 2018 is by and large 
inclusion. We saw it in the recent 
90th Academy Awards when 
a jittery Frances McDormand 
fierily 
advocated 
inclusion 

riders to a crowd of hesitant yet 
emphatic cheers. The Grammys, 
in typically uncanny fashion, had 
a few cutesy symbolic gestures 
of their own and brought out 
rapper Logic to preach mental 
health awareness.

Despite 
Logic’s 
inevitable 

corniness, and the faintly musty 
smell of the Oscars, there was a 
sense that these organizations 
cared — or at least wanted you 
to know that they cared — about 
representing diversity. 

There is a difference, of 

course, between the portrayal of 
inclusion and actual inclusion. 
People who have any sort of 
difference from the norm might 
be portrayed in film or in music, 
but whether they’re actually 
included within the process of 
the art making is an altogether 
different question, and one that 
varies community to community.

For people with disabilities, 

the question of whether they’re 
included 
in 
art 
making 
is 

almost always answered with a 
dismissive “no.” While people 
with disabilities make up nearly 
20 percent of the U.S., they’re 
rarely included in the arts. A 
survey of 900 films from 2007-
2016 found only about two 
percent of characters have a 
disability, and overwhelmingly 
those who do are portrayed by 
an able-bodied person.

Take the Oscar winner for Best 

Picture this year, “The Shape of 
Water.” The film follows a mute 
janitor who falls in love with a 
mythical sea creature. Because 
of her disability, the character 
speaks in sign language. The 
character was portrayed by 
Sally Hawkins, an able-bodied 
actress, and she spent months 
training with an American Sign 
Language teacher for the role.

Disability-rights 
advocate 

Susan Fitzmaurice said in an 
interview with The Daily that 
the portrayal missed a crucial 
detail.

“As the movie went on, she 

looked at her hands. Nobody 
who signs looks at their hands. 
That became a real distraction 
for me. It’s a great movie, but 
that one piece was a distraction. 
And for people who were deaf 
or mute, it became an extreme 
distraction,” she said. 

Fitzmaurice is particularly 

interested in the intersection 
of arts and disability. For 10 
years she has been a volunteer 
for VSA Michigan, the state 
chapter of the international 
organization that focuses on 
arts and disability. VSA, or 
Very Special Arts, was founded 
by Ambassador Jean Kennedy 
Smith and is a department in 
the John F. Kennedy Center 
for the Performing Arts. VSA’s 
website explains their mission 
is “to create an inclusive society 
where people with disabilities 
participate in, learn through, 
excel in and enjoy the arts.”

Because 
disability 
can 

take 
many 
forms, 
VSA’s 

advocacy and consulting do 
as well. VSA teaches artists 
how to get involved in the 
disability community, and it 

teaches 
teachers 
interested 

in incorporating art into the 
classroom how to interact with 
a student with a disability. Many 
of these teachers have never 
received any kind of disability 
training.

VSA Michigan works with 

professional artists too, putting 
on 
exhibitions 
and 
local 

workshops around the state.

Fitzmaurice’s 
work 
with 

the organization is focused on 
accessibility. She makes sure 
the venues are accessible for 
events the organization puts on, 
visiting and testing each facility 
in person. Because Fitzmaurice 
uses 
a 
wheelchair 
herself, 

she said she can recognize 
the details that well-meaning 
facilities might simply overlook.

“I open a lot of eyes. I think 

a lot of people think about 
disability in terms of what 
they can see, and they don’t 
think about the little stuff,” 
Fitzmaurice said. She gives an 
example by shaking the table at 
which she’s sitting.

“Like how distracting it is 

if you have a table that moves 
around, and you have a kid 
that’s really distracted with 
movement.” She shakes the table 
again.

“You 
want 
them 
to 
pay 

attention and you want them to 
interact with the art, and instead 
all they’re thinking about is 
that this table they’re sitting at 
is moving. They can’t focus on 
what the art is trying to do; they 
can’t focus on what the teacher is 
trying to tell them to do. They’re 
focusing on this table that’s 
moving,” Fitzmaurice said.

Fitzmaurice 
is 
passionate 

about ensuring people with 
disabilities have equal access to 
art because she said it offers them 
the ability to express themselves 
in nontraditional ways. Art can 
be different, she said, as long 
as it speaks to you. People with 
disabilities can feel liberated 
in creating things that don’t 
necessarily look traditionally 
beautiful, because it speaks to 
their 
individual 
experience. 

People with disabilities can 
communicate through this form 
of expression.

“It’s OK that your art doesn’t 

look like everybody else’s art. 
Art may be perfect for who you 
are. And just that can inspire 
people to look at it,” Fitzmaurice 
said.

She points to a painting that 

sits atop a bookcase, a red and 
orange abstract expression.

“That was painted by an 

elementary-school student who 
had a disability. I walked in, 
it spoke to me, so I bought it,” 
Fitzmaurice said.

VSA 
Michigan 
assists 
in 

all forms of art. That means 
painting, but also film, music, 
performance, etc. She gives 
the example of an after-school 
rap group they worked with in 
Hamtramck and a young soloist 
program they have.

While 
VSA 
Michigan 

sometimes 
finds 
professional 

artists with disabilities to work 
with 
students, 
Fitzmaurice 

said it’s difficult because these 
systems aren’t currently in place 
in public education. Students 
with disabilities are rarely given 
the opportunity to participate 
and pursue art at a young age, 
and so people with disabilities 
are not always well represented 
in the arts community. Most 
of those who go on to have full 

careers in art, she said, are in 
film.

Nic 
Novicki, 
an 
actor, 

comedian 
and 
producer, 

understands the nuances of 
being a person with a disability 
in the film industry. From early 
on, he learned that to have 
a fulfilling career in film, he 
needed to carve his own path.

“I think the fact that I was 

producing 
my 
own 
content 

gave me the experience that 
traditional Hollywood wouldn’t 
have given me,” Novicki said in 
an interview with The Daily.

For Novicki, his extensive 

résumé of producing is what 
got his foot in the door for 
major roles, like his first on 
“The Sopranos.” He started 
doing stand-up comedy while 
in business school at Temple 
University and began writing 
and directing films, including 
“A Little Broke,” which was 
acquired by ShortsTV. Once 
he had that experience, he was 
able to land other TV roles, like 
his critically-acclaimed work 
on 
“Boardwalk 
Empire” 
as 

showman Carl Heely. Like any 
other actor, he said, it took years 
of consistent progress to get 
work in the industry.

Producing content also meant 

writing and portraying the roles 
Novicki wanted to play rather 
than roles that were focused 
solely on his disability.

“As a little person actor, it 

can sometimes be hard to find 
roles that aren’t so focused on 
the disability itself. But in doing 
my own work, I’ve been able to 
allow people with disabilities, 
even beyond myself, the role of 
the lawyer, or the bad boyfriend, 
or the good boyfriend, or a 
gangster,” Novicki said. 

Realizing he was in a position 

to change the narrative of people 
with disabilities in film and TV, 
Novicki worked with Easterseals 
— a national organization that 
advocates 
for 
people 
with 

disabilities and of which Novicki 
is a board member — to create 
the Disability Film Challenge. 
For a span of 55 hours over the 
weekend, 
participants 
write, 

film and produce a three-to-
five-minute short film. A winner 
is selected at the end of the 
competition.

While actors are certainly 

involved, Novicki is focused on 
getting people with disabilities 
behind the camera too. It’s 
the lack of representation in 
the entire film set and not 
just on screen that accounts 
for 
misrepresentation 
and 

stigmatization of people with 
disabilities, he said.

Winners of the competition 

include Jamie Brewer, an actress 
with 
Down 
Syndrome, 
best 

known for her acclaimed work 
in “American Horror Story,” and 
Dickie Hearts, a gay and deaf 
man whose winning short film 
“Passengers” went on to win 
HBO’s Project Greenlight digital 
series competition in 2015.

The aim is to get the film 

industry 
and 
the 
disability 

community working together. 
According to Novicki, filmmakers 
and industry professionals often 
come to the festival to get people 
with disabilities involved in 
their projects. For people with 
disabilities, it offers a chance 
to get their name recognized, 
meet other filmmakers and gain 
experience in an industry that 
is not always easy to break into 
without an extensive network.

Every time my older sister 

Lauren would shower, she’d send 
vibrations into my quiet room, 
drowning the space with a loud but 
angelic voice. There’s a home video 
of her at three years old, singing 
absolute nonsense to herself on the 
beach. She has always had some 
type of leading role in every school 
musical, and she could always 
flawlessly take any note up an 
octave. Since I can remember, my 
sister has always been singing.

By the time Lauren was 14 years 

old, she was studying classical 
music and taking opera lessons. 
Four years later, she played 
Carlotta in our high school’s 
version of “Phantom of the Opera,” 
and she even had a senior solo at 
an awards ceremony, where she 
sang “Caro Nome” from the Italian 
opera “Rigoletto,” by Verdi. Shortly 
after, she went off to Penn State to 
study speech pathology, and there, 
she found herself joining singing 
groups like a contemporary co-ed 
choir and an all-female gospel 
choir.

Her talent and passion for music 

haunted her, however, and it was 
toward the end of her freshman 
year 
when 
she 
decided 
she 

would leave Penn State to pursue 
studying opera. Lauren’s future 
was changing, and it was well-
structured, promising and bright.

In the summer of 2013, Lauren’s 

glistening future was called into 
question when a fluke dive into a 
black-bottom pool caused her to 
be paralyzed from the nose down. 
Her singing was, momentarily, 
pushed to the side. Just trying to 
scratch her nose became her first 
challenge among many.

Through the past five years, 

Lauren has overcome a sea of 
adversity in her journey to recovery. 
From not being able to feed herself 
to now being able to lock her 
own knees (the most important 
feature 
of 
regaining 
walking 

ability), Lauren is, literally, steps 
away from walking and gaining 
different forms of independence. 
Even with her dedication to 
physical recovery, her passion for 
singing has made a way into her 
paralysis. Nonetheless, singing as 
a quadriplegic is a completely new 
experience from her pre-accident 
voice.

A physical hurdle that comes 

with singing as a quadriplegic 
is lung capacity and abdominal 
control 
— 
operatic 
singing 

demands a great deal from those 
areas. She mentioned the difficulty 
of breathing deeper while sitting 

and trying to tighten the abs to 
extend a note. Due to the height of 
Lauren’s injury (her C-6 vertebrae, 
just at the base of her neck), these 
areas of her body were weakened 
and, therefore, needed to be 
re-trained.

“There’s less fluidity. I have 

to really think about my body 
much more, which makes singing 
almost like a workout,” Lauren 
told me. “When you’re paralyzed 
at the level I’m at, my core and 
legs are affected by the type of 
paralysis that I have. I have been 
lucky enough to regain function 
and sensation in that part of my 
abdomen, but you never realize 
how physical singing is until you 
don’t have a fully-working body to 
sing in.”

Despite 
physical 
hurdles, 

there are mental and emotional 
challenges Lauren has faced when 
trying to present her talent. She 
highlights that one of the main 
struggles was trying to be less 
critical of her current voice, which 
has become less powerful and 
full due to the lack of abdominal 
control. She has had to overcome 
the stress of being in a unique 
spotlight: an opera singer in a 
wheelchair.

“Mentally, I’m trying to get over 

that personal criticism. I don’t feel 
like I’m as good … There’s a fear 
around performing or not wanting 
to be seen in a vulnerable way or 
perceived as untalented,” she said. 
“Even with singing, and going 
on stage performing, there are 
limitations to parts you can play or 
pieces you can sing … it’s stressful.”

However, 
Lauren 
is 
an 

innovator and an explorer. She 
enjoys seeing what her body can 
do as it’s paralyzed. She mentioned 
how singing for her is still freeing 
— singing from her chair, in the car 
or during rehabilitation workouts:

“I’m more inspired to sing just 

for fun, even if I’m judging myself,” 
she said. “There are so many 
emotions that can be processed 
when you have any event happen 
to you like a spinal cord injury. Art 
is an amazing way to process those 
emotions.”

She is familiar with this idea due 

to her inspiration from other artists 
in the disability community. She 
reminisced with me about the time 
she met Ali Stroker, a quadriplegic 
performer who was the runner-
up on “The Glee Project” in 2012 
and made history as the first-ever 
Broadway actress in a wheelchair. 
Lauren also mentioned her love 
for Andrea Bocelli, the wildly 
talented and famous Italian singer 
who is blind. She believes that it’s 
people like Bocelli who are “giving 
visibility to the disability, and that 

there are things that need to be 
said and need to be heard” within 
the art world.

Other than Lauren’s almost-

achieved goal of walking again, 
singing is something she still sees 
in her future. She reflected on the 
idea that opera has always been a 
part of her and a part of our family, 
and she wants her talent to stay 
close to home as a hobby.

“I love singing, and if anything, 

I think it would be cool to make 
your own beats or sing over 
your own track 
— some form of 

creative expression,” she said. “But 
ultimately, I think opera is such a 
niche genre, so I definitely would 
have to find a way to blend it with 
something more contemporary.”

My sister and I are highly 

invested in art. Whether we paint 
together or we watch a movie, 
she and I are always engaging in 
different mediums of creativity 
and new avenues of exploring art. 
She believes that if one has the 
“need to create art,” then there 
is a place for anyone in the art 
community.

“We’ve all overcome a lot, and 

while I’ve overcome something 
different than most people, at the 
end of the day, that shouldn’t be a 
criterion on how you’re judging 
my art,” she said. “I don’t need a 
grading curve for my art. I don’t 
think I’m the only person in the 
disability community that feels 
that way because we want to be 
seen as artists, not artists with 
disabilities. You should want to 
judge their art for how it makes 
you feel.”

I could hear the tightness in the 

back of her throat over the phone, 
that constriction one feels as they 
begin to form tears. “I never want 
to be judged in a way that’s like ‘Oh 
my god, she’s so good and she’s in 
a wheelchair.’ I never want to be 
good because I’m disabled. I want 
to be great, period.”

And she is. She’s great because 

she’s a singer, a painter, a fearless 
artist and my pain-in-the-butt 
sister. She’s great because she cries, 
she laughs and she sings nonsense 
on the beach, even at 24 years old. 
She’s not just great because she’s 
a quadriplegic operatic singer, 
and she’s not just great because 
she’s 
triumphantly 
overcome 

tribulation. She’s great because 
she’s Lauren, period.

“Art is meant to be shared, 

although it’s a personal thing. 
It thrives more so on an outside 
opinion because that’s where it can 
grow and can be cultivated. Art 
blends all the facets of one’s life. 
Our emotions do not stop. Ever. 
And by expressing that emotion, 
you can work through anything.”

Novicki said now is the time 

for inclusion. He cites the ABC 
sitcom “Speechless,” which has 
multiple people with disabilities 
involved 
in 
production 
and 

writing, as well as “Game of 
Thrones” and “Breaking Bad,” 
both of which have characters 
with 
disabilities 
portrayed 

by people with those actual 
disabilities, as examples of what 

proper inclusion looks like.

“I have to say, it’s unbelievable 

to see Peter Dinklage on ‘Game of 
Thrones’ as this amazing, smart 
leader of a family, really the 
brains of the operation,” Novicki 
said. “And for all those people 
who watch the show, they’re not 
thinking of the helpless dwarf. 
They’re thinking of the leader.”

Despite 
the 
lack 
of 

representation now, Novicki is 
certain that the tide is shifting, 
and he’s confident that more 
exposure will lead to more 
opportunities for people with 
disabilities.

The

There’s a saying in the autistic 

community that if you’ve met 
one person with autism, you’ve 
met one person with autism. 
Autism spectrum disorder is just 
that: a spectrum. It manifests 
in drastically different ways 
in different people. This can 
present 
real 
challenges 
for 

writers, actors and directors 
looking to tell stories about 
autism on screen. If the autism 
spectrum is so broad, how could 
any 
fictional 
representation 

come close to capturing the 
autistic experience? What would 
an accurate depiction of autism 
even look like?

The 
good 
thing 
about 

television is that there’s no 
other form of entertainment 
that allows an audience to spend 
as much time with characters 
as they develop, to encounter 
those characters in a variety of 
emotional states and situations 
and to come away with a 
nuanced understanding of who 
those characters are. The small 
screen seems like the best-suited 
medium for creating complex, 
layered portrayals of autism, 
and a recent wave of shows with 
autistic 
characters 
suggests 

audiences might start seeing 
these more often.

Last 
week, 
“The 
Good 

Doctor,” a medical drama about 
a surgical resident with autism 
and savant syndrome, ended 
its first season on ABC as the 
most-watched drama on network 
television. Dr. Shaun Murphy 
(Freddie 
Highmore, 
“Bates 

Motel”) is a brilliant surgeon 
whose mind works in fascinating 
ways. In each episode, we 
see 
visual 
representations 

of 
his 
brain 
as 
he 
pieces 

together anatomical diagrams 
and 
snippets 
from 
medical 

school textbooks to arrive at 
unconventional diagnoses. It’s a 
sweet, if mawkish, celebration of 
difference, but there’s something 
troubling about the way Shaun’s 
autism is framed throughout.

In the pilot, the hospital’s 

board of directors convenes to 
discuss their concerns about 
Shaun’s hiring. Empathy and 
communication, they say, are 
crucial for doctors to have — 
doesn’t Shaun’s autism make 
these impossible? The hospital 
president Dr. Glassman (Richard 
Schiff, “The West Wing”) quickly 
emerges as Shaun’s sole defender, 
delivering an impassioned plea 
on his behalf — the first of many. 
“Yes, he has autism,” Glassman 
cries. “But he also has savant 
syndrome — genius-level skills in 
several areas!”

The pop culture fascination 

with the autistic savant isn’t 
new, and it carries with it the 
uncomfortable implication that 
autism is some sort of flaw to be 
compensated for. Are people on 
the spectrum without savant 
capabilities 
less 
worthy 
or 

valuable? On “The Good Doctor,” 
the constant sentimentality can 
make these stirring speeches 
seem compassionate. Beneath 
the 
surface, 
though, 
they 

feel capitalistic — insensitive 
conceptions of human worth as a 
function of productivity.

“Atypical,” a Netflix comedy 

which aired its first season in 

August 2017, is decidedly less 
schmaltzy, but falls into a few 
unsettling 
tendencies 
of 
its 

own. The show centers around 
Sam (Keir Gilchrist, “United 
States of Tara”), an autistic high 
school senior who decides to 
foray into the world of dating. 
It’s a family show, with all of 
the usual trappings of the genre 
— high-strung mom, dopey dad, 
neglected sibling — but to its 
credit, it isn’t the sensational or 
glamorized version of autism 
“The Good Doctor” is. “Atypical” 
is quite honest about what it 
means to be Sam, and what it 
means to be a part of his family.

Where 
the 
show 
really 

stumbles is its humor. Too often 
it feels as if we’re meant to be 
laughing at Sam, as if pieces of 
his personality are punchlines. 
It 
raises 
some 
interesting 

questions about how comedies 
should go about handling autism. 
Character-driven 
comedies 

have long used their characters’ 
idiosyncrasies and quirks as 
fodder for jokes. But what 
happens when those behavioral 
idiosyncrasies are symptoms? 
How should writers navigate 
that balance in a way that isn’t 
needlessly cruel or judgmental?

On “The A Word,” a lovely 

drama on the BBC, the jokes 
are plenty, but they’re never 
at the expense of Joe (Max 
Vento, “Cotton Wool”), a five-
year-old in Northern England 
recently diagnosed with autism. 
The show is a smart, tender, 
fabulously soundtracked portrait 
of the joys and frustrations of 
raising a child with autism. 
At times, “The A Word” could 
focus a bit more on Joe and a bit 

Ezra Fields-Meyer & the 
engaging art of animation

MAITREYI ANANTHARAMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“I am an expert in Disney 

and other animated films. 
When people tell me their 
birthdays, I can tell them what 
movies were released on those 
days.”

Ezra Fields-Meyer has been 

making animated videos since 
he was 12 years old, having 
loved animation from a young 
age. He also draws pictures 
using 
online 
tutorials 
to 

guide him and finds art to be 
soothing for his autism, which 
he was diagnosed with as a 
child.

One of Fields-Meyer’s first 

videos, 
“Alphabet 
House,” 

stemmed from his interest in 
letters, numbers and shapes. 
In the video, every letter of 
the alphabet lives in a house. 
The letter “F” climbs to the 
top of the house and falls, and 
several of the letters take him 
to the emergency room. When 
“F” returns home, all the 
letters celebrate and tell him 
not to climb up again.

It’s clever and charming, 

with 
funny 
dialogue 
and 

colorful 
animations. 
But 

when Fields-Meyer posted the 
video on YouTube in 2008, he 
didn’t know it would lead to 
something larger.

“One year later, a bestselling 

children’s book author and 
illustrator 
named 
Tom 

Lichtenheld saw my video 
on YouTube and he thought 
the idea would make a great 
children’s book,” Fields-Meyer 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily.

Their book, “E-Mergency!” 

was published in 2011, and it 
follows the story of the letter 
“E” who becomes injured and 
has to be replaced by the letter 
“O.”

“It took a couple of years to 

publish and it was an exciting 
and thrilling experience to 
become a published author at 
age 15,” Fields-Meyer wrote. 
“It was inspired by my ideas 
from ‘Alphabet House,’ but 
Tom did most of the work. He 
is very talented!”

Now, Fields-Meyer makes 

flash-animated 
videos 
at 

Exceptional Minds, a non-
profit animation and visual 

effects school and studio for 
young adults on the autism 
spectrum. Exceptional Minds 
helps him learn the computer 

skills and techniques needed 
to create animations.

This doesn’t come without 

its 
challenges

Meyer. His autism can make it 
difficult for him to focus in art 
classes, and he stresses about 
scheduling events.

“I have a lot of anxiety about 

certain things,” Fields-Meyer 
wrote. “For example, I worry 
about whether I’ll be able to 
make it to movies or other 
things I follow. But doing art 
helps me calm down. Also, it’s 
fun and it makes people happy 
when I share them on social 
media.”

In the future, Fields-Meyer 

hopes to continue creating 
his own animated films and 
collaborating 
with 
others. 

He’s also considering working 
as an animator as well as some 
other options.

“I love children’s books 

such as ‘Dr. Seuss,’ ‘Curious 
George,’ and ‘Eric Carle,’ and 
I would like to create more 
children’s 
picture 
books,” 

Fields-Meyer wrote.

Individuals on the spectrum 

often face difficulty entering 
the 
workforce. 
According 

to a 2015 report by the A.J. 
Drexel Autism Institute, 58 
percent of young adults with 
autism were employed. This is 
significantly lower than their 
peers with disabilities, as 95 
percent of young adults with a 
learning disability, 91 percent 
with a speech or language 
impairment, 91 percent with 
an emotional disturbance and 
74 percent with an intellectual 
disability were employed.

Art 
therapy 
and 
art 

in 
general 
have 
become 

increasingly 
recognized 
as 

potential treatment options 
for people on the autism 
spectrum. 
Art 
provides 
a 

medium for communication 
and may help children tolerate 
new stimuli as they become 
exposed 
and 
desensitized 

to new textures and smells 
for their artwork, like using 
paste-covered 
newspaper 

strips to create a paper-mâché 
project. 

“I use certain tools when I 

draw my pictures that calm 
me down — such as colored 
pencils, markers and even the 
paper,” Fields-Meyer wrote. 
“Just sitting and doing it 
calms me down and makes 
me feel good. It also calms me 
down when I play games on my 
iPhone or I listen to familiar 
songs from Disney and other 
animated films.”

Fields-Meyer isn’t the only 

artistically 
inclined 
person 

in his family. His father Tom 
wrote human interest stories at 
People Magazine for 12 years. 
His last article was about his 
relationship with Ezra, which 
he eventually turned into the 
novel “Following Ezra: What 
One Father Learned About 
Gumby, Otters, Autism, and 
Love From His Extraordinary 
Son.”

“I 
thought 
it 
was 

unbelievable that he wrote 
down stuff that happened with 
me that I actually remember 
and it was so exciting to have 
it remembered in a book. I 
also thought it had lots of 
funny and amusing parts and 
it helped people understand 
autism,” Fields-Meyer wrote, 
reflecting on the experience 
of reading his father’s memoir.

When 
Fields-Meyer 
isn’t 

making animated videos or 
drawing, he can be found 

visiting museums, theme parks 
and 
zoos, 
teaching 
online 

and reading books to kids in 
preschools 
and 
elementary 

schools.

“I love reading books to 

young kids because it makes 
me feel good when they get a 
reaction from the stories they 
hear — they laugh or smile 
at the pictures or words or 
they ask questions,” Fields-
Meyer wrote. “I love being 
with young kids and teaching 
them.”

Regardless of what Fields-

Meyer is doing — whether 
creating 
animated 
videos, 

reading to children or making 
other artwork — he maintains 
a positive outlook on his life 
and disability.

“Even though I have autism, 

it’s totally OK and it’s a really 
good thing because despite 
the disorders I can do certain 
things not many others I know 
could do. I have a photographic 
memory of certain things and 
I remember all kinds of things 
since I was a little boy. If I 
meet you, I can ask you when 
your birthday is and tell you 
what film was released on 
your birthday or what movies 
came out the year you were 
born,” Fields-Meyer wrote. “I 
like certain things that other 
people don’t like as much — for 
example, I usually like sequels 
better than (or just as much as) 
the original movie. And I like 
some movies better because 
they are more colorful and 
high tech and more modern. 
Sometimes I talk loud but I 
don’t mean to but that’s OK. 
I don’t think it’s bad — it’s 
totally fine. It’s the way I am.”

The representation of autism in modern television

TV

less on the sordid personal lives 
of his relatives, but the show is 

often at its most engaging when 
it uses a wider lens to examine 
the way communities respond 

to disability and interrogate 
their own prejudices. It’s all 
done with such a light touch that 
“The A Word” never feels like a 
PSA or a “Very Special Episode.” 
The nuance brings to mind the 
underappreciated “Parenthood,” 
which 
offered 
audiences 
its 

own measured, groundbreaking 
portrayal of Asperger’s — one 
that still remains a favorite of the 
autistic community.

For all the strides made in 

autism representation recently, 
there’s still so much room for 
improvement. The prevalence 
of “autism headcanons,” fan 
interpretations of undiagnosed 
TV characters as autistic — 
Brennan on “Bones,” Sheldon 
Cooper 
on 
“The 
Big 
Bang 

Theory,” 
Abed 
Nadir 
on 

“Community” 
and 
Benedict 

Cumberbatch’s “Sherlock” are 
just a few — speaks to the real 
desire for a broader range of 
identities and experiences on 
screen. 
Television 
characters 

with autism have been, for the 
most 
part, 
high-functioning, 

straight, 
able-bodied, 
white 

and male. Stories about autism 
should aim to be as diverse as 
the real autistic community. 
One way to achieve that? Start 
including people with autism 
in the making of these shows. 
Not just as interview subjects or 
informal consultants, but in the 
writers’ room and in front of the 
camera. Our TV will be far better 
for it.

SECONDARY 

For people with disabilities, 

engaging in the arts can be 
a 
frustrating 
and 
isolating 

experience. Around the world, 
countless theaters, museums 
and concert halls lack the 
proper 
accommodations 

necessary to be accessible to 
people with disabilities. In the 
last half-century, the global 
disability 
rights 
movement 

has made significant strides in 
securing the rights of people 
with disabilities to lead full, 
independent lives. Despite this 
progress, however, there’s still 
work to be done. Deaf actor and 
model Nyle DiMarco recently 
reminded people of this after 
a series of his tweets spurred 
controversy 
surrounding 

AMC Theaters’ subpar closed-
captioning system for deaf and 
hard-of-hearing moviegoers.

“I’m 
really 
disappointed,” 

DiMarco tweeted. “Theaters 
are basically for all the able-
bodied 
people.” 
DiMarco 

made note of the faulty closed-
captioning devices used at AMC 
theaters, which are often prone 
to inaccuracies and skipping 
lines. Stories like DiMarco’s 
have led to an influx of pressure 
on movie theaters to upgrade 
their 
equipment 
or 
offer 

more frequent showings with 
on-screen closed captioning. 
The frustrations of DiMarco 
and other deaf moviegoers, 
however, are only a symptom 
of a greater problem affecting 
the arts: Accessibility for people 
with disabilities is often not 
taken into account.

It is the privilege of able-

bodied people to not have to 

worry about how they’ll be 
able to get up a flight of stairs, 
navigate a crowded museum or 
enjoy the show they’re trying to 
attend. It stands to reason, then, 
that this lack of accessibility 
comes more from ignorance 
than anything else. The unique 
needs of people with disabilities 
may seldom be thought of in 
the corporate boardrooms that 
make decisions which impact 
accessibility 
at 
arts-related 

venues. It’s a problem that’s 
worsened by the lack of exposure 
to invisible disabilities. Some 
forms of autism, for example, 
may make it difficult for people 
to be in crowded areas or deal 
with sudden loud noises, while 
long restroom lines may be 
prohibitive for individuals with 
Crohn’s Disease.

It is absolutely crucial that 

the arts be accessible for all 
people, and the current lack of 
accessibility is unacceptable. 
Art isn’t just entertainment; 
it’s a form of interpersonal 
communication 
meant 
to 

transcend barriers of language, 
race and national origin. It 
highlights how we are far more 
similar than different. If art 
venues aren’t doing everything 
feasibly within their power 
to ensure that the arts can be 
accessed and enjoyed by all 
people, then they are doing 
an active disservice to the 
advancement of the arts as a 
whole. Film, music and other 
mediums occupy a massive 
portion of our collective societal 
attention, and the right of 
people with disabilities to enjoy 
art and partake in these social 
phenomena 
is 
instrumental 

to their ability to lead normal, 
fulfilling and independent lives.

Luckily, 
there 
are 
art 

institutions 
and 
venues 

striving to do it right. In 2014, 
English National Ballet turned 
their sights toward creating 
accessible children’s media. The 
company decided to put on their 
own adaptation of the ballet 
“Coppélia.” The ballet tells 
the story of Doctor Coppélius, 
a cantankerous old inventor 
who builds a life-sized dancing 
automaton. 
The 
company’s 

production, titled “My First 
Coppélia,” was intended to 
be a simplified version of the 
classic 1870 ballet, complete 
with 
numerous 
accessibility 

measures to ensure all children 
would be able to enjoy the 
show. Striving to make the 
show accessible to children 
with 
autism, 
the 
company 

scrutinized 
their 
lighting, 

sound effects and narrative. 
They reworked the dancing 
role of Doctor Coppélius into 
an 
on-stage 
narrator 
and 

brought a British Sign Language 
consultant on board to teach the 
dancers and narrator key signs 
to aid deaf and hard-of-hearing 
children. 
The 
production 

also 
incorporated 
a 
digital 

companion that used Widgit 
symbols, an alternative form of 
communication used by those 
with 
certain 
communicative 

impairments. 
“My 
First 

Coppélia” was the first in a 
whole series of modified ballets, 
titled 
“My 
First 
Inclusive 

Ballet.”

The Louvre in France has 

also taken notable steps to 

enhance museum accessibility. 
The museum is housed in what 
was once the Louvre Palace, 
originally built in the 12th 
and 13th centuries by King 
Philip II, which is not exactly 
what comes to mind when you 
think of accessible structures. 
Nevertheless, the museum has 
taken extraordinary measures 
to 
ensure 
accessibility 
for 

all guests, including special 
tours for guests with mobility 
impairments. 
The 
Louvre 

reports 
these 
tours 
serve 

roughly 10,000 guests per year. 
In 1995, the museum installed 
the Tactile Gallery, a permanent 
exhibit for the visually impaired 
in which the museum’s golden 
rule — do not touch — is 
encouraged to be broken. “Some 
people run their hands over the 
works, and some even knock on 
them to understand the material 
of which they’re made,” the 
Los Angeles Times wrote in a 
proflie of Cyrille Gouyette, the 
co-head of the gallery. In the 
piece Gouyette said: “There’s 
really a way to learn how to 
touch, with habits to learn.” The 
gallery contains exact replicas 
of original works and is one 
of a growing number of touch 
galleries and tours found in 
museums around the world.

In comparison to many of 

the 
innovative 
accessibility 

advancements 
being 
made 

throughout 
the 
world, 

accessibility in art spaces at the 
University seems to be a mixed 
bag. The University Musical 
Society, for example, organizes 
musical 
performances 
in 

various venues across campus, 
including Hill Auditorium, the 
Power Center for Performing 
Arts and Rackham Auditorium. 
UMS offers a noted array of 
accessibility measures in the 
venues it uses; these include 
programs in large print and 
braille, 
assistive 
listening 

devices, and American Sign 
Language 
interpretation

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘BE CAREFUL’

 Contrary to what Cardi B 
may have lead you to believe on 
her previous releases, she has a 
fragile side. While “Be Careful” 
is certainly a scathing post-
breakup track, its chorus doesn’t 
shy away from Cardi’s vulner-
ability: “Yeah, my heart is like a 
package with a fragile label on it 
/ Be careful with me.” Trading 
in the booming atmosphere of 
her party anthems, Cardi raps 
and croons over a lilting, tender 
synth line, undercut with sparse 
snares and only the subtlest 
ripple of bass. It’s a total 180 in 
comparison to hits “Bodak Yel-
low” and “Bartier Cardi,” but an 

impressive, intriguing lead up to 
the release of a new album next 
Friday, Apr. 6.
 On “Be Careful,” the phrase 
takes on a double meaning. Cardi 

warns her past lover that actions 
have consequences, while warn-
ing future lovers that she won’t 
tolerate offense or infidelity. She 
raps on the second verse, “Teach 
me to be like you so I can not 

give a fuck / Free to mess with 
someone else, I wish these feel-
ings could melt / ’Cause you don’t 
care about a thing except your 
mothafuckin’ self,” spiteful of her 
own emotions and the apathy of a 
significant other. The lyricism is 
surprisingly emotional here, and 
much more introspective than 
most of her previous work. It’s 
anyone’s guess if this lead single 
is indicative of the tone for the 
rest of the album, but thankfully 
we only have a few more days 
before finding out.

available with advance notice.

At 
other 
University 

institutions, 
such 
as 
the 

University of Michigan Museum 
of Art, accessibility seems to 
typically meet only the bare 
minimum. All of the museum’s 
exhibits 
are 
wheelchair 

accessible, 
and 
wheelchairs 

are available upon request. The 
museum’s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan states American 
Sign Language interpretation is 
available, but such a service isn’t 
directly advertised anywhere 
on the museum’s website.

To its credit, the museum 

does 
have 
occasional 

programs featuring increased 
accessibility, such as the “My 
Turn” 
Special 
ASD 
Access 

Hours, which has been held 
once a year for the last two 
years. The program is intended 
for 
families 
with 
children 

affected by Autism spectrum 
disorder and features “sensory 
reducing 
accessories 
and 
a 

quiet area with tactile toys.” 
While these efforts are a step 
in the right direction, it’s not 

enough for an institution to be 

inclusive and accessible for one 

day a year. Greater accessibility 
standards should be the norm, 
not a special occasion. Until 
these 
accessibility 
measures 

are applied on a more consistent 
and permanent scale, it’s hard to 
say the University’s art spaces 
are 
accomplishing 
anything 

more than meeting the bare 
minimum 
of 
accessibility 

standards.

It’s unlikely that all art 

spaces will ever be completely 
accessible 
to 
all 
people, 

but it’s important that any 
institution committed to the 
advancement of the arts also be 
on the forefront of innovative 
accessibility 
measures. 
This 

is because art is, at its core, 
meant to be a documentation 
of the human experience — to 
leave anyone out is to detract 
from that fundamental goal. 
These ongoing innovations in 
accessibility of art spaces form 
the cornerstone of an ongoing 
effort to make the arts available 
to 
everyone, 
regardless 
of 

race, religion, background or 
disability. 

CARDI B. 

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘BARTIER CARDI’

 As a song, “Bartier Cardi” is 
self-indulgent. From the opening 
line, “Your bitch wanna party 
with Cardi,” Cardi B makes it 
known that she’s not here to be 
humble. Celebrating her new-
found fame and fortune, Cardi B 
revels in the luxury that comes 
with being the center of pop 
culture attention. With “Bartier 
Cardi,” she has her cake and 
eats it too, wearing her Cinder-
ella crown with pride, dropping 
verses about her diamonds, her 
Ferrari, her Offset without even a 
second glance.
 It makes sense, then, that the 
music video for “Bartier Cardi” 
is equally as ostentatious, glit-
tering with excessive opulence 
and starring Cardi B: necklaces 
winking in the spotlight, nearly 
engulfed by a bright red fur coat, 
blonde hair piled high. Marilyn 
Monroe, eat your heart out.
 The video opens on the sun-
bleached decks of a pool house, 
marble statues waving from the 
peripheries as Cardi B mutters, 
“Bardi in a ’Rari, diamonds all 
over my body / Shinin’ all over 
my body,” in the background. 

Wealth is disposable here: shots 
of dollar bills lying forgotten 
in the water, rooms overrun by 
elaborate fruit plates and fur-
niture arrangements and girls 
in every corner, reclining in fur 

robes, swiping the frosting off of 
cakes with one bored finger.
 In every location of the music 
video, as it moves from the pool 
to a dimly lit labyrinth where 
men with eight-packs walk 
around like Ken dolls before 
finally ending at an underground 
party, Cardi B is omnipresent. 
She watches on from television 
sets placed in discreet corners, 
as girls count endless piles of 
money. She shows her influence 
through the “Cardi” tattoos that 
grace each of the shirtless men’s 
necks. These people are her 
accessories. Fallen completely 
under her spell, they can’t take 

their eyes off her pixelated image 
on the screen. Even 21 Savage 
ends up entranced, after being 
tied up in front of a row of glar-
ing TVs in a scene taken straight 
out of “1984.”
 At times, “Bartier Cardi”’s 
music video can be overdone; the 
shots of Cardi reclining on the 
hood of a car coupled with clips 
of Cardi and Offset wrapped 
around each other in that same 
car’s backseat borders on cliché 
— a lower quality version of what 
Beyoncé already did in “Parti-
tion.”
 But, to be fair, this is Cardi 
B — the woman who once said 
she would most likely find her 
dream man in a strip club — so 
over the top can be expected, 
even embraced. After all, she 
never seems happier or more 
comfortable than she does at the 
end of the music video, as a beau-
tiful bride dressed head to toe 
in white (fur coat on, as always), 
walking into a party created just 
for her.

Thursday, April 5, 2018 — 5B

In a culture centered around 

appearance, 
the 
fashion 
and 

modeling industry holds a huge 
weight in today’s society. Amid 
unrealistic 
body 
expectations, 

name 
brands 
and 
distorted 

representations, it is easy to get 
wrapped up in the downfalls 
of this materialistic business. 
With 
such 
an 
emphasis 
on 

aesthetics and looks, a great 
amount of room for error and 
false representation comes into 
play in the world of fashion and 
modeling. I love fashion as much 
as the next person, but among 
the love and lust, a fair amount of 
mistakes, misinterpretations and 
just straight-up misconducts go 
unnoticed.

In 2015, Interview Magazine 

released their winter cover, which 
pictured none other than Kylie 
Jenner posing in a wheelchair. 
Jenner and Interview’s motive 
for the shoot caused an explosion 
of comments within and beyond 

the 
disability 
community. 

One woman’s response to the 
photoshoot managed to spark an 
entire conversation surrounding 
Jenner’s controversy. Author and 
disability activist Erin Tatum went 
viral when she reenacted Jenner’s 
cover in her wheelchair.

“If being in a wheelchair is 

trendy now, I’ve apparently been a 
trendsetter since before Kylie was 
born,” Tatum wrote in a Tumblr 
post.

Defining ableism in its rawest 

form, 
Jenner’s 
fetishization 

and wrongful depiction of the 
disability 
community 
opens 

up a conversation that is still 
extremely relevant in the fashion 
and modeling industry today. The 
disability community is simply 
not represented in modeling, or 
properly designed for by leaders 
of the fashion industry. White, 
cisgender and able-bodied females 
like Jenner stand at the center of 
this industry that many of us care 
so much about. Jenner portrayed 
disability as something artsy and 
provocative 
when 
represented 

by her identity, but when actual 
members 
of 
the 
disability 

community fill this role, they are 
looked down on as incapable, sick 
and sad, as Tatum mentioned in 
her Tumblr post.

Ever present now as it was in 

2015, the need for this multifaceted 
community to be integrated into 
the fashion and modeling world is 
all the more necessary. We need 
accurate representations of the 
disability community in modeling, 
and 
we 
need 
adequate 
and 

fashionable and practical clothing 
options for this community as well.

Lucky for those searching for a 

silver lining in the sometimes dark 
industry, followers of the fashion 
industry are able to find hope 
and inspiration in Aaron Philip. 
Gaining guidance from fashion 
trailblazers 
with 
disabilities 

such as Jillian Mercado and Nyle 
DiMarco, Philip, a transgender 
model whose pronouns include 
she/her/hers 
and 
they/them/

theirs, have started a revolution in 
the fashion industry. As a model, 
they represent and advocate for 
themself and the entire disability 
community through their work. 
DiMarco, a deaf actor, model 
and activist, was the first deaf 
person to win “America’s Next 
Top Model” and “Dancing with 
the Stars.” Founder of the Nyle 

DiMarco Foundation, DiMarco 
serves as a role model to deaf 
models and children, speaking to 
language equality and advocacy 
for literature. Philip’s leading 
inspiration, 
Jillian 
Mercado, 

who was diagnosed with spastic 
muscular dystrophy as a teen, has 
landed modeling contracts with 
IMG Models and Diesel Jeans, 
agencies that include a lineup 
of famous supermodels such as 
Kate Moss and Heidi Klum. In 
addition, 
Mercado 
starred 
in 

Beyonce’s “Formation” video and 
a marketing campaign for Target. 
Aligning themselves with these 
individuals 
with 
disabilities, 

Philip accredits their pursuance 
of modeling to Mercado especially.

“I credit Jillian Mercado as 

a trailblazer for people with 
disabilities in fashion,” Philip 
wrote in an email interview with 
The Daily. “I credit all the hard 
working Black models for their 
beauty & visibility in fashion right 
now. I credit all the upcoming 
trans models for their advocacy 
and visibility as well. I’m a part of 
all of this, and I just want to work 
hard to break boundaries.”

Acknowledging the need for 

progress in this industry, Philip 
is spearheading a movement one 
simply must rally behind.

“The modeling industry has 

so many issues with not even 
bothering to take risks and portray 
disabled bodies of all types in any 
way,” Philip wrote. “Sometimes 
they may see an aesthetic within 
disability in terms of the mobility 
aids we use and glamorize that, 
but they still proceed to prioritize 
big names & able-bodied people. 
They appropriate disability instead 
of getting actual models with 
disabilities involved.”

As a Black, transgender and 

disabled model, Philip has built 
a platform for themself via social 
media and blogging, working into 
the modeling world and setting 
straight the false aesthetics the 
modeling and fashion industry can 
so often rest heavily upon.

“I have issues with the way 

fashion 
tends 
to 
ignorantly 

objectify certain things from 
certain types of people and 
amplify it. For example, cultural 
appropriation 
is 
a 
problem, 

ableism in the sense that disabled 
bodies are negatively objectified 
by the disability and not the talent, 
general racism & trans people 

feel uncomfortable in fashion as a 
space,” Philip wrote.

Philip’s role in the modeling and 

fashion world is the much-needed 
push for a long overdue change to 
what can be a challenging cycle. 
Philip’s multifaceted identity is 
real, something people can relate 
to and certainly something that 
has challenged the idea of models 
as commodified products. 

“I think designers could start 

with acknowledging physically 
disabled folk as a part of their 
narrative and as potential clients, 
and with that comes having to 
work with physically disabled 
models of all conditions and body 
types as well,” Philip wrote.

So to the modeling world: 

Please, no more Kylie Jenners 
posing in bedazzled wheelchairs. 
What we need is a continuation 
of the monumental movement 
Philip, DiMarco and Mercado 
have started and will continue 
to sculpt for future generations 
of the disability community. The 
ever-changing industry needs an 
aesthetic that is real, accessible, 
narrated and designed by those 
who live the reality of disability. 
Only then will the fashion and 
modeling industry be something 
we will be proud to associate with 
and acknowledge. 

For the past 50 years in music, 

it has often been cool to be sad. 
The countercultural phenomena 
that have guided teenagers and 
young adults for decades — 
movements like grunge, goth, 
new wave, alternative and punk 
— tap into the darker side of 
life, opening the door to themes 
like 
depression, 
nihilism, 

dissatisfaction 
and 
rebellion 

for millions — if not billions 

— of those who identify with 
them. The hipsters of every era 
tend to be typecast as angsty, 
if not completely bummed-
out — it’s a modern tradition 
for each period of bubblegum-
sweet popular music to be 
matched with an opposing force 
of artistic power, one that is 
historically more alternative 
and well, sad. This plays into 
stereotypes, yes, but it also 
offers a mode of expression 
for 
people 
struggling 
with 

legitimate issues beyond the 
façade, namely mental illness 
and the disabling, very real 
sadness it can produce.

Now, without the need for a 

record company to distribute 
music, 
this 
tradition 
of 

counterculture has shattered 
into thousands of subgenres 
within subgenres, an endless 
line of evolutions from the 
legends of the past. Nothing 
has changed the rap scene in 
this way so much like the full 
embrace of Soundcloud as a 
method of distribution and 
expression — so much so that 
the “Soundcloud rapper” has 
become a social type. Though 
this movement often boasts 
an image of party-savvy and 
drugged-up youth, it has also 
offered a niche for rappers to 
tackle previously untouched 
or hidden topics, one of these 
subjects being mental illness 

and the nihilism that sometimes 
comes 
with 
it. 
This 
has 

spawned rap’s new guard, an 
assemblage of teens and early 
20-somethings 
with 
names 

like Lil Pump, Lil Xan, Lil Uzi 
Vert and Lil Peep, boasting the 
collective title of “emo rap.”

Why are they all “Lil”? We’ll 

never know. But it is clear from 
their music that these artists 
are not afraid to attack the 
darker side of life, most notably 
the realities of depression and 
the drug addiction that can 
accompany 
it. 
Their 
songs 

have lyrics like, “I don’t really 
care if I die / Push me to the 
edge / All my friends are 
dead,” (“XO TOUR Llif3,” Lil 
Uzi Vert) and “My life is goin’ 
nowhere / I want everyone 
to know that I don’t care,” 
(“OMFG,” Lil Peep). This music 
is a subversive tangent from the 
classically 
hyper-masculine 

stereotypes of rap, attacking 
the taboos of mental illness and 
its consequences with a brash 
sense of self-assuredness. It 
has a characteristically slow, 
reserved 
tempo 
and 
heavy 

low end, creating a weight in 
each song that only enhances 
their typically melancholy or 
mundane lyrics.

“Emo rap,” or “sad rap,” 

as some have called it, still 
maintains the “party hard, get 
bitches” mentality of the rap 
music of late, a parallel with the 
similarly popular trap music of 
artists like Migos. But it goes 
beyond the party, often using 
the motifs of drugs like Xanax 
and lean to enhance a blissed-
out image. Though it may seem 
like their music encourages 
drug use, it is slowly moving 
towards the opposite. Artists 
like Lil Xan often make a point 
to deter their fans from diving 
into drug use further than 
just the image it presents. Xan 
himself is known to yell things 
like “Fuck Xanax 2018!” at his 
concerts, and his songs contain 
lyrics like “Xans don’t make 
you / Xans gon’ take you,” to 
emphasize this sentiment even 
more.

The emo rap scene originated 

with a sense of self-destruction, 
but 
has 
recently 
shifted 

towards an image that still 
maintains the teen angst and 
recklessness of its past with 
a new warning of its dangers. 
Though it still perpetuates an 
image that glorifies sadness and 
heavy drug use, emo rap has 
the potential for change in this 
area. The people who listen to 
emo rap are typically in it for 
the aesthetic, but can get drawn 
into the lifestyle via the image 
and fall prey to its realities. 
This image is likely not going 
to change anytime soon, as it 
is sometimes more popular 
than the actual music, but the 
content has a chance to make up 
for that. Instead of completely 
embracing 
the 
sadness 
of 

depression 
and 
addiction, 

Lil Xan and many of his 
contemporaries have integrated 
a wary message into their music 
— one that celebrates partying, 
but points out the disabling 
sadness and looming addiction 
that the party lifestyle often 
creates in its participants with 
a rough but honest voice.

This presents itself most 

intensely in light of the recent 
Nov. death of Lil Peep, one of 
the genre’s rising stars. Peep 
was only 21 at the time of his 
untimely death 
— a suspected 

drug overdose on his tour bus in 
Temple, Ariz. He was perhaps 

the most outspoken member 
of the emo rap scene about 
his struggles with depression, 
taking 
a 
no-holds-barred 

approach to his musical content 
in terms of transparency. Peep 
was open about the realities 
of life as someone who battled 
many demons, a drug user and a 
member of the genre which has, 
in the past, glorified drug use to 
a dangerous extent. 

In one of his last interviews 

with Montreal media outlet 
MONTREALITY, Peep touched 
on this candidly, saying “You 
can’t 
predict 
where 
you’re 

going to be next year. You have 
no idea. I’ve been in very, very, 
very low points like shitty 
situations, horrible situation,” 
continued 
Peep. 
“My 
mom 

always tells me time will heal 
everything … It will eventually 
get better.”

His colleagues, artists like 

Lil Xan, have taken his death 
as an opportunity to comment 
on the image they portray of 
an alluring world that indulges 
in drugs and sadness. There 
is still a ways to go in order to 
get rid of the negative aspects 
of the emo rap image, but many 
of the genre’s intentions show a 
unique side of rap that has been 
left unexplored in the past. 
The realities of mental illness 
and disabling addiction are a 
consistent presence in emo rap, 
and that has opened a door for 
further development of the 
genre.

Though much of its music 

now highlights partying, emo 
rap holds an intriguing promise 
for the future, one which offers 
a complex mix of awareness 
and the classic themes of 
recklessness 
that 
listeners 

know well. It continues to be a 
fascinating case study in what 
happens when self-destruction 
reaches a tipping point. The 
response to Lil Peep’s death 
has proven that many of the 
genre’s artists are committed 
to shifting their message to 
one that warns of the dangers 
hidden in partying and the 
glorification of mental illness. It 
is possible that the Soundcloud 
rappers have something more 
to say here, and their music 
has the potential to spread that 
message to those who really 
need it.

The Oscars adore films that 

address disabilities. In recent 
years, actors and directors have 
grappled with portraying a wide 
range of mental and physical 
challenges, and their peers have 
rewarded them for it. Eddie 
Redmayne (“The Danish Girl”) 
won Best Actor in 2015 for his 
portrayal of the late Stephen 
Hawking, who had Amytrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in “The 
Theory of Everything.” Last 
month, Guillermo Del Toro’s film 
“The Shape of Water,” whose 

mute protagonist communicates 
through 
American 
Sign 

Language, won Best Picture. 
However, 
neither 
Redmayne 

nor Sally Hawkins (“Maudie”), 
the leading actress for “The 
Shape of Water,” share the same 
disability as their character. In 
fact, according to a study by the 
Ruderman Family Foundation, 
95 percent of characters with 
disabilities are played by able-
bodied actors.

I reviewed “The Shape of 

Water” and originally applauded 
Hawkins for her performance. 
As an able-bodied person, I was 
unconscious of the issues with 
giving a potential role for a mute 
person to an actress who can 
speak. My praise for the film 
also had to do with the onslaught 
of tone-deaf and caricatured 
portrayals 
of 
people 
with 

disabilities that had desensitized 
me to the more nuanced problems 
with 
representation. 
After 

watching the recent comedy 
“Please Stand By” about a young 
woman with autism and the 
trailer for the romantic tearjerker 
“Me Before You,” I had low 
expectations for these films. “Me 
Before You” perpetuates the false 
notion that death is better than 
living with a disability. The film 
exploits the character’s disability 
to tell a tragic, pathos-heavy story 
where suicide is glorified as the 
best and only choice, and love as 
a sort of cure, trivializing the real 
struggles people with disabilities 
face every day.

The casting of Sam Claflin 

(“Love, Rosie”) in “Me Before 
You” 
and 
Dakota 
Fanning 

(“The 
Alienist”) 
in 
“Please 

Stand By” are just a couple 
examples of Hollywood using 
“cripface,” a term that refers to 
able-bodied 
actors 
portraying 

characters 
with 
disabilities. 

Understandably, several opinion 
articles 
and 
film 
reviews 

published on Huffington Post 
and The Guardian from members 
of 
the 
disability 
community 

have 
expressed 
discontent 

over 
their 
representation 
in 

films. In particular, films like 

“Please Stand By” attempting to 
examine the autism spectrum 
fail to remember that there is a 
spectrum. Instead, actors go for 
what they think will have the 
most dramatic, emotional result, 
but end up giving a cold, detached 
performance or a volatile, violent 
depiction — neither of which fairly 
represent people with autism. 
What’s worse is that according 

to a comprehensive list compiled 
by film website Indiewire, many 
of these actors are rewarded 
with accolades: At least 59 able-
bodied 
actors 
have 
received 

Oscar nominations for portraying 
characters with disabilities, both 
mental and physical.

The way that films like “Me 

Before You” and “Please Stand 
By” 
so 
blatantly 
appropriate 

disability as a way to manipulate 
audiences numbed me to the 
underlying issues with “The 
Shape of Water.” When I watched 
“The Shape of Water,” I wasn’t 
outright 
offended. 
Here, 
I 

thought, no one used unrealistic, 
insulting slapstick humor relating 
to an aspect of the character’s 
condition. The character wasn’t 
flat or tokenized, exploited for 

tears or violence. But these are 
excuses. 
Especially 
now, 
we 

should hold films to a standard 
above just being inoffensive.

A film that might appear 

inoffensive can send dangerous 
messages 
and 
perpetuate 

prejudices through stereotyped 
characterizations. When Cuba 
Gooding Jr. in “Radio” or Tom 
Hanks in “Forrest Gump” act as 

happy cheerleaders who bring 
up the spirits of those around 
them, 
their 
performances 

suggest 
a 
subliminal 
and 

actually 
insulting 
implication 

that 
able-bodied 
people 
can 

find 
joy 
through 
comparing 

their situation to a person with 
disabilities for perspective. Or 
when 
M. 
Night 
Shyamalan’s 

“Split” and other horror movies 
like Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” 
incorrectly suggest mental illness 
as a precursor to violent and 
homicidal behavior. In the case 
of “The Shape of Water,” critics 
praised the film for embracing 
the “other,” but on a second look, 
the movie actually shuffles its 
marginalized protagonist away 
from society and into the arms of 
a non-human species.

A common counterargument 

to the need for more disability 
representation in film is that an 
actor’s job description demands 
inhabiting the mind and body 
of a character different from 
themselves. While this side of 
the debate has some legitimacy, 
the point is not to ban able-
bodied actors from portraying 
characters 
with 
disabilities. 

Instead, filmmakers need to offer 
equal opportunities to actors 
with 
disabilities, 
especially 

since 
casting 
actors 
with 

disabilities may help alleviate 
the exploitation and potential 
insensitivity of the portrayal 
of a character with disabilities. 
Plus, able-bodied actors have a 
larger variety and choice of roles. 
Filmmakers love to tell stories 
with disabled characters, yet 
Hollywood discriminates against 
people with disabilities through 
both inaccurate depictions and 
unequal opportunities on screen.

Although big and independent 

studios have failed to represent 
the disabled community, short 
films have done a better job 
and often express an explicit 
educational 
message. 
This 

year’s Academy Award for Best 
Live Action Short Film went 
to Britain’s “The Silent Child,” 
featuring Maisie Sly, a young 
deaf girl, as she faces challenges 
at school without a teaching 
aide. In addition, the well-
respected Manhattan Short Film 
Festival awarded Latvian actor 
Aleksandrs Ronis the honor of 
Best Actor for his starring role 

in “Just Go!.” Ronis, who lost 
both his legs, speeds through 
the streets in this action short, 

proving 
movies 
don’t 
need 

an able-bodied actor to have 
incredible stunt scenes.

Other actors with disabilities 

on the big screen also defy the 
myth that audiences will not 
watch films starring people with 
disabilities. Millicent Simmonds 
(“A Quiet Place”) stole the scene 
in last year’s film “Wonderstruck” 
about the parallel stories of two 
deaf children in different eras — 
and, as a deaf actress, she has the 
right to tell this story unlike able-
bodied Rinko Kikuchi (“Pacific 
Rim”) in “Babel,” who portrayed 
a 
deaf 
teenage 
girl. 
Peter 

Dinklage 
(“Three 
Billboards 

Outside Ebbing, Missouri”) has 
such an extensive filmography it 
needs a separate Wikipedia entry. 
He 
overcame 
discrimination 

from 
casting 
directors 
who 

only wanted him to act as a 
leprechaun or other demeaning 
characters to find critical and 
commercial success, becoming 
one of the highest paid actors on 
television for his work in “Game 
of Thrones.” His career shows 
an evolution in representation 
afforded to great talent after 
many years of struggle finding 
work. After refusing to play 
degrading characters, Dinklage 
took on roles that transcended 
common tropes of characters 
with disabilities — the victim, 
the 
object 
of 
pity 
or 
the 

undesirable. His first commercial 
breakthrough in the Christmas 
movie “Elf” allowed him to react 
with outrage when the main 
character wrongly mistakes him 
for an elf. But in Tom McCarthy’s 
2003 drama “The Station Agent,” 
Dinklage plays a character with 
sexual 
desires 
and 
attracts 

the attention of his romantic 
interests, 
a 
narrative 
often 

withheld from characters with 
disabilities.

At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day, 

Hollywood needs to recognize 
the discrimination inherent in 
refusing roles of characters with 
disabilities from actors with 
disabilities. It’s not a question of 
acting caliber or ticket sales, but 
of providing equal opportunity to 
everyone.
