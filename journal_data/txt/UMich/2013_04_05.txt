Take Back the
Night rally brings
together survivors
By CHANNING ROBINSON
Daily Staff Reporter
More than 150 University
students and Ann Arbor resi-
t dents assembled at the Michi-
gan Union Thursday night for
"Take Back the Night," a rally
aimed to raise awareness about
sexual assault in the Ann Arbor
area. Held annually in April
- which is designated as Sex-

ual Assault Awareness Month
- Thursday's event marked the
35th local Take Back the Night.
Take Back the Night is a
national organization that's
goal is to empower and comfort
survivors of sexual assault. Part
of the event's goal was to create
a safe space in which survivors
can share their stories and get
mutual support, said Pam Swid-
er, a leader of the Ann Arbor
chapter.
The event featured a number
of speakers arid performers who
encouraged sexual assault sur-
vivors to focus on moving for-
ward with their lives despite the

horrific events they had faced.
The indoor event was followed
by a march through the streets
of Ann Arbor during which par-
ticipants chanted. ("out of the
buildings and into the streets!
Take back the night!") Partici-
pants linked arms and sang dur-
ing a candlight vigil after the
march.
The evening's key speaker
was Gregg Milligan, author
of "God Must Be Sleeping," a
memoir detailing his child-
hood experience of abuse at the
hands of his mother, his subse-
quent recovery and the after-

Seventh annual
papier-mich

downtown
By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
SeniorArtsEditor
For the last seven years,
once a year at the beginning of
April, papier-mch creatures
and monsters congregate and
parade downtown. Their color-
ful papered faces and designs,
propped by poles, swing madly in
the early spring air. FestiFools is
back, and this weekend promises
to bring jest and fun to the still-
wintry streets of Ann Arbor.
Mark Tucker, University pro-
fessor and creative director of
WonderFool Productions, said
the idea for an April Fools' Day-
themed festival came about
through his work with the Lloyd
Halls Scholars Program. He'd
been working with students in
art for non-majors, and his class
took on a community theater
project.
"One thing led to another,
and I had this history of build-
ing large papier-mch floats in
Italy, and so it was already in my
blood," Tucker said. "I decided
to see what would happen if I
created a course around it. The

Students launch
petitions to overturn
0 UEC ruling - and
endorse cake
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Judiciary
will hear appeals filed by parties
youMICH and forUM against
the University Elections Com-
mission this weekend in what
could be the penultimate step
before ratifying an election that
was supposed to end more than a
week ago.
The initial results of the elec-
tion were overturned when the
University Election Commission
found that forUM's presiden-
tial candidate, LSA junior Chris
Osborn, was guilty of influencing
students while voting and dis-
qualified him and his vice-presi-
dential running mate, LSA junior
Hayley Sakwa.
Osborn and Sakwa had nearly
500 more votes than youMICH's
candidates. Business junior
Mike Proppe and LSA sopho-
more Bobby Dishell, youMICH's
candidates are in line to take
the executive office if CSJ rules
against forUM's appeal. The pair
took second place in the election,

behind Osborn and Sakwa by
nearly 500 votes.
youMICH will also be appeal-
ing the UEC's decision to dis-
miss its complaint that forUM
misused an e-mail listserv. If
forUM - which was awarded
eight demerits for violations of
financial contribution limits by
an individual - receives two or
more demerits, the party and all
its candidates will be disqualified
from the election.
Supporters from forUM have
already responded to the dis-
qualification of their presidential
ticket. Earlier this week a Rack-
ham student Wonwoo Lee, a
current assembly representative,
started a UPetition through the
CSG website that denounces the
UEC's decision.
The UPetition service requires
users to use their uniqname to
sign the petition and requires no
response from CSG regardless of
the amount of signatures.
The petition, which had
more than 600 signatures as of
Thursday night, called Osborn
and Sakwa's disqualification
"unprecedented and egregious"
and alleges that the photographs
of Osborn influencing students
while voting were taken by mem-
bers of "opposing parties" who
were "stalking" Osborn during
the election.

Golden Apple Award winner Shelly Schreier, an LSA lecturer, gives her "last lecture," the talk she would give if she
only had one left, Thursday in Rackham Auditorium.
Golden Apple recipient
Shreier gives 'last lecture'

Psych. professor
focuses talk
on 'good choices'
By DANIELLE WALLICK
Daily StaffReporter
As the applause died down,
several students' voices emot-
ed from the front rows of the
Rackham Auditorium: "We
love you, Shelly!" The largest
crowd in the 23-year history of
the Golden Apple Award greet-
ed Psychology lecturer Shelly
Schreier as she delivered her
"last lecture" in front of her
family, faculty and students on
Thursday.

The Golden Apple Award
- sponsored by the Univer-
sity of Michigan Hillel - was
inspired by the teachings of a
third-century Jewish scholar
named Rabbi Eliezer ben Hur-
kanos, who believed everyone
should live each day as their
last. The Golden Apple is meant
to honor professors who teach
as if every one of their lectures
is their last, and strive not only
to impart their knowledge, but
inspire students as they go. It
is presented annually by stu-
dents to one such outstanding
faculty member nominated by
students.
Schreier, a third-genera-
tion University graduate, has
strong ties to the campus and

has been leading lectures full
time since 1999.
"It is the students affirming
that I have made a difference in
their lives," Schreier said dur-
ing her lecture.
Schreier's "last lecture," a
term used to mean the address
she would give as if it were
her last, was titled "Make
Good Choices." Named after
the advice she instilled in
her daughters, she shared 12
recommendations on how to
make the best decisions pos-
sible, including do more than
the minimum expected, use all
of your senses to explore the
world and make someone's day.

PONTIAC, Mich.
Freeway shooter
to undergo a
psychology exam
The lawyer for a man charged
in a series of shootings on and off
Interstate 96 in Michigan says
his client will undergo an inde-
pendent psychiatric examina-
tion.
Attorney Doug Mulkoff told
Oakland County Circuit Judge
Denise Langford Morris on
Thursday that he was in the pro-
cess of arranging the evaluation
for Raulie Casteel.
Langford Morris approved a
request for a pre-trial date, now
set for May 30.
Casteel faces 60 charges,
including attempted murder,
linked to shootings in Commerce
Township and Wixom.
CHICAGO
Famous movie
critic Roger Ebert
dies at age 70
Roger Ebert had the most-
watched thumb in Hollywood.
With a twist of his wrist, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning critic
could render a decision that
influenced a nation of moviego-
ers and could sometimes make or
break a film.
The heavy-set writer in the
horn-rimmed glasses teamed up
on TV with Gene Siskel to create
a format for criticism that proved
enormously appealing in its sim-
plicity: uncomplicated reviews
that were both intelligent and
accessible and didn't talk down
to ordinary movie fans.
Ebert, film critic for the Chi-
cago Sun-Times since 1967, died
Thursday at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago, two days
after announcing on his blog
that he was undergoing radia-
tion treatment for a recurrence
of cancer. He was 70.
ALBANY, N.Y.
Approaching gun
laws provoke high
ammunition sales
Gun enthusiasts fearful of new
weapon controls and alarmed by
rumors of government hoard-
ing are buying bullets practically
by the bushel, making it hard for
stores nationwide to keep shelves
stocked and even putting a pinch
on some local law enforcement
departments.
At a 24-hour Walmart in subur-
ban Albany, the ammunition cabi-
net was three-fourths empty this
week; sales clerks said customers
must arrive before 9 the morning
after a delivery to get what they
want. A few miles away, Dick's
Sporting Goods puts up a red
rope after ammunition deliveries
so buyers can line up early to get
a number, averting races up the
escalator to the gun counter. Both
stores are limiting ammunition
purchases to three boxes a day.

ROME
Italian priest
stole $5.1M from
hospital
Italian police on Thursday
arrested a priest accused of pock-
eting 4 million euros ($5.1 mil-
lion) from a Catholic hospital he
ran and helping run up 600 mil-
lion euros ($769 million) in debts
that forced it into bankruptcy.
Italy's finsancial police placed
the Rev. Franco Decaminada,
whountil 2011was the CEO of the
IDI dermatological hospital in
Rome, under house arrest. They
also detained two other people
while seizing a Tuscan villa that
police say Decaminada built with
stolen money.
The plight of1,500 IDI workers
who haven't received paychecks
for months had prompted Bene-
dict XVI in one of his last acts as
pope to name a delegate in Feb-
ruary to take over the religious
order that owns the hospital to
try to bring it back to financial
health.

"It is outrageous that such
underhanded tactics be allowed
to undermine the voices of the
Michigan student body," the
petition reads. "This is a student
government election. Lawsuits
should not be an annual tradi-
tion."
Another student involved in
the election decided to make use
of the CSG's online petition ser-
vice, too. LSA junior Russ Hayes,
who won a seat in the assembly
with youMICH, submitted a peti-
tion shortly after which calls on
University President Mary Sue
Coleman to officially support
cake, not a party candidate, but
dessert.
Hayes declined to comment
on the petition, entitled "Cake
is Delicious." The petition iden-
tifies a presumably ficticious
group, forCAKE, who believe
cake has been pigeonholed as a
desert reserved only for birth-
days.
"We demand that the Uni-
versity Administration and
the wider campus community
accept that cake can be tasty
and filling in any form: be it
carrot, bundt, sponge, or even
fruit," it reads.
As of Thursday night, the peti-

ending, so April Fools' was the
first day we did it."
Tucker's past experience
with papier-mach helped pro-
vide a jumping-off point for
the course idea. He travelled to
Viareggio, Italy with students
through Global Intercultural

Experience for Undergraduates
(GIEU) and with two artists
from New York who are part
of the Super Concept Monsters
company. His intent was to
learn the art of cartapesta, or
papier-mach6.
"One of the things they do
the night before a big festival
(in Viareggio), is they make
these little lanterns and ... the
villagers light the lanterns,"
Tucker said. "I knew it'd be dif-
ferent in Ann Arbor, butI want-
ed to see how it would work in
the form of a downtown city
environment."
Tucker brought the spirit of
cartapesta to the University.
After working on a project for
another event in the Michigan
Theater, he realized that the
creatures and creations could be
turned into luminaries.
"There were limited things we
could do in the theater," Tuck-
er said. "So, we were trying to
keep everything we had made
in the audience, and there was
limited lighting, so we thought
'we'll light up the pieces from the
inside,' and so we started down

ready to support survivors in
need of assistance or just some-
one to talk to.
Sabra Briere, a Democrat on
the Ann Arbor City Council, said
the event encourages individu-
als to feel a sense of control over
their lives.
"Take Back the Night is about
you feeling powerful," Briere
said. "It's about you feeling in
charge of yourself and in charge
of your surroundings and not
frightened of strangers or your
best friend's boyfriend."

a Take Back the Night volunteer,

after the 2012 event.
dential candidate, Nick Swider.
As some students prepare for
student government court cases
and file petitions that require
no response, other students are
making headway on their cam-
paign promises.
Business junior Scott Chris-
topher said he has already been
in talks with E. Royster Harper,
vice president for student affairs,
to set upa meeting. While Chris-
topher said the CSG president
can. accomplish more than an
average student, he will present
three points of his platform to
Harper.
He has identified two of
the most important points of
his platform as improving the
Counseling and Psychological
Services and adding a "blue-
light button" to the University
of Michigan app, which would
alert University Police of a stu-
dent's location in the event of an
emergency.
Christopher said he is still try-
ing to decide what the third goal
he presents to Harper will be, but
has been asking students around
campus fortheir input.
Christopher said he and his
campaign team noted actions
by other parties for which com-
plaints could have been filed, but
didn't report them as they would
have had no effect on the out-
come of the election.
Still, he realizes why forUM
and youMICH have chosen to
grapple in court, and noted
and theories we learn about fit
together so well with how we
desire to lead happy, healthy and
productive lives."
As a part of her award, Sch-
reier was also granted $1,000
to donate to the charity of her
choice. She chose to contribute
to a program that allows children
in C.S. Mott Children's Hospital
to visit Camp Michigania - a
Alumni Association sponsored-
camp in northern Michigan - a

boasting their creations high above
the streets. But along with stu-
dents, community members out-
side of the University have started
bringing their own monsters and

sculptures to the event. Wonder-
Fool Productions hosts workshops
during which anyone can craft
their papier-machd masterpieces.
"People can come and make
their own luminaries," Tucker
said. "That's really the amazing
thing to see - the whole town
gets excited, comes together
to make the pieces and comes
together again to present them to
the rest of the community."
The students and the people of
Ann Arbor will see each other's
work for the first time on Sunday.
"We meet on the street on the
first time on Sunday. We haven't
seen theirs, they haven't seen
ours; it's a really nice energy,"
Tucker said.
Along with FestiFools, the
third annual FoolMoon on Fri-
day will host a slew of artists and
activities to kickstart the Festi-
Fools weekend.
"We needed a fundraiser as
well as something that would be
interesting to go to," Tucker said.
"FoolMoon became the thing
that we said, 'we'll have sponsors

"I thought it was a great expe-
rience to really raise awareness
about such a prevalent issue,
especially on college campuses,"
Williams said.
Williams added that joining
the organization has increased
her awareness of the prominence
of sexual assault and how many
people have been affected by sex
crimes.
"It's really opened my eyes
to how common sexual assault
is, which is awful," Williams
said. "It's raised my awareness
to that and also realizing the
amount of comfort that we can
give victims by showing our
support."
that these hearings seem to be
a product of an election code
that encourages suits to be

"I understand both sides of
the coin," Christopher said. "I
understand the incentives which
are built into the process after the
elections are over."

protracted the fallout from the
election, the less respect stu-

"I think at this point, each
individual has to make that

something I weighed and said,
'You know what? The hearings
and stuff probably won't change
the outcome for me. If they
would, how much damage would
be done by this, would it hurt me
more than help me?"'
Despite the combative nature
of the complaints and their ensu-
ing appeals, Christopher said he
thinks the newly-elected repre-
sentatives and executives will get
along.

'Hijabis' talk
about identity
in America

'Hijabi Monologues'
provides humorous
take on meaning of
head covering
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
andDaily StaffReporter
After organizers were forced
to turn patrons away due to
an overcrowded Rackham
Amitheater, Thursday night's
performance of "The Hijabi
Monologues" started with two
words: "I'm tired."
"I'm tired of being the rep-
resentative for a world religion
every time I go outside," LSA
junior Zeinab Khalil said in her
opening line.
Khalil's monologue was
the first of 14 performed by
undergraduate and graduate
students, recent graduates, pro-
fessionals, Muslims and non-
Muslims. The goal of the night
was to take the focus off the
hijab and onto the hijabi - the
woman wearing the headscarf.
"The Hijabi Monologues"
calls itself the "inverse" of
Eve Ensler's "Vagina Mono-
logues" - taking a similar for-
mat to the feminist play. But
instead of focusing on making
a normally private topic pub-
lic, the play talked about the
individual meaning of being a
Muslim woman in modern U.S.
society. Actresses performed
pieces about serious topics like
the death of a son, but also told
more lighthearted stories, like
the fun of taking a cat named
"Sexy" to the vet.
"We're basically trying to
normalize women who wear
the headscarf," said Rackham
student Imaan Ali, one of the
performers. "We have the same
worries; we have the same
crushes on celebrities if we're
young. We suffer the same way;
we cry the same way; we laugh
the same way."
Public Health studentAmena
Qureshi, a performer at the

event, said popular media and
misinformation can perpetuate
stereotypes about women who
choose to wear the hijab, but
events like the "Monologues"
can begin to open up conver-
sation about the relationship
between religion and identity.
"We're just as educated and
motivated as any human being,
but we also choose to show our
religionblatantly andhonestly,"
Qureshi said in an interview.
But the monologues weren't
all about the discrimination
women who wear a headscarf
often face. Topics touched on
football games and ineffective
pickup lines, seldom mention-
ing the hijab itself.
"None of the stories actually
discuss it or discuss wearing it
per se as much as they discuss
worries that really bring out
the idea of this complex human
being," said Rackham student
Nama Khalil, director of "The
Hijabi Monologues."
After the intermission,
Kahlil and her co-director,
LSA sophomore Mobashira
Faroogi, introduced the begin-
nings of their new project: "The
Kufi Diaries," pitched as a male
version of "The Hijabi Mono-
logues." The event will simi-
larly be comprised of stories
by University students. A kufi
is a traditional hat common in
many Islamic African nations.
Thursday's performance fea-
tured the first two kufi stories,
but Faroogi said they hope to
stage a performance of a com-
pleted production in Fall 2013.
LSA freshman Shukria Fai-
rooz said she particularly
enjoyed the humor in the play,
especially in the monologue
titled "Shy Girl" about a quiet
hijabi who ends up beating up
a boy after he was rude to her.
The Muslim Engineering
Students' Association, the Mus-
lim Students' Association, the
Center of Engineering Diversi-
ty and Outreach, and Rackham
Student Government sponsored
the free event.

Enabling the disabled
The University needs to make a clear effort to accommodate all students
Students can pick from countless extracurricular activities at
the University. With intramural sports, student organizations
and Greek Life, there are plenty of ways to stay active outside
of the classroom. However, things aren't as easy for students with
disabilities. They may find themselves barred from the IM sports
teams or unable to access some lecture halls across campus. While
Services for Students with Disabilities has made great strides in pro-
viding students with disabilities the proper academic help, Univer-
sity leaders can't ignore these issues and must continue to strive to
build a community that's accepting and accessible to all students.

W hen Benjamin Franklin
and the other founding
fathers left Indepen-
dence Hall after
the Constitu-
tional Conven-
tion of 1787,
anxious citizens
waited outside
the hall for
news. A woman
asked Frank- PATRICK
lin what they MAILLET
had created, to
which Franklin
responded, "A
Republic, if you can keep it."
The United States is one of the
world's longest ongoing republics,
withstanding tests from a civil war
to economic collapse. Unfortunate-
ly, the integrity that has secured
this epic republic's success is in dire
jeopardy. The 2010 U.S. Supreme
Court decision in Citizens United v.
Federal Election Commission, more
commonly known as Citizens Unit-
ed, threatens this great nation, and
unless we tirelessly work to reverse
its all-reaching power, it'll erode
the very core of this country.
The Citizens United decision
was a 5-4 vote that opened the
floodgates for limitless campaign
contributions by individuals, cor-
porations and unions to political
"super PACs." Although the exact
details of the decision are compli-
cated and could take up multiple
novels - let alone a single column -
the important factor of the Citizens
United decision is that it reversed
much of the McCain-Feingold Act,
a 2002 campaign finance bill.
The 2012 electionwas the United
States' first true glimpse of the ter-
rifying power that Citizens United
had unleashed. The Federal Elec-
tion Commission estimates that $7
billion was spent on the 2012 elec-
tion cycle. Furthermore, according
to The Wall Street Journal, super
PACs spent $567,498,628 on the
2012 elections, $98 million in the
final week of October. Of this mas-
sive amount of super PAC money,
58.9 percent of donations were $1
million or higher and were given by
a total of 159 individuals. Most ter-
rifying of all, because super PACs
can accept funds from nonprofit
organizations, which are legally

allowed to conceal the identities of
their donors, roughly 31 percent of
outside spending in 2012 was given
anonymously and cannot be traced
to its original donor.
These numbers are truly stagger-
ing and have given us a preview of
what a post-Citizens United Amer-
ica will look like. Individuals such
as the Koch Brothers or Sheldon
Adelson can fund entire campaigns
and can single-handedly install
elected officials who best protect
their personal interests. Take, for
example, Adelson, who famously
bragged about donating $100 mil-
lion in the 2012 election. If anyone
truly believes that limitless cam-
paign contributions don't threaten
our very democracy, let's look at the
role that Adelson and his multi-bil-
lion-dollar wealth played in 2012.
In early 2011, Adelson madeA it
known that he was willing to do
whatever it took to ensure Presi-
dent Barack Obama's defeat in 2012.
He originally supported Newt Gin-
grich as the Republican candidate
and donated more than $20 million
to the former speaker of the house's
campaign. Adelson wasn't a fan of
Romney, but once Gingrich fell out
of the race, Adelson was forced to
accept the GOP candidate. The bil-
lionaire's support didn't come easily,
though. Looking back, it was solidi-
fied only after Romney attended
a fundraiser in Israel at Adelson's
side. Perhaps desperate to appease
Adelson's famously hawkish views
on Israel, Romney blamed "cultural
differences" for the economic dis-
parities between Israel and Palestine
and admitted that peace was most
likelyunattainable.
Romney's desperate appease-
ment of Adelson didn't stop at just
foreign policy. Within four days of
being named Romney's running
mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.)
flew out to Las Vegas for a personal,
closed-door meeting with Adel-
son. Because candidates are pro-
hibited from explicitly asking for
super PAC donations, the Romney
campaign was quick to reassure
the media that this was a "finance
event, nota fundraiser."
In the end, Adelson donated
more $30 million to Restore Our
Future, the super PAC that sup-
ported Romney. This may seem like

a lot of money to you and me, but to
a man worth more than $21 billion,
it isn't much. Had Romney been
elected and had he implemented his
tax plan filled with tax cuts for cor-
porations and the wealthy, Adelson
would have saved approximately
$2 billion. For a man who made his
fortune in casinos, this was a bet
that could've paid out big returns
for him.
Our democratic

The Services for Students with Disabilities
office serves the 4 percent of students who have
some sort of disability. They assist students by
providing note-taking services and various
electronic services that can aid in academics.
While these measures are certainly helpful,
they don't guarantee the inclusive environment
within lecture halls and classrooms that leads
to an effective learning experience.
Some newer buildings such as the Ross
School of Business may prove accessible for
students with physical handicaps; however, all
University lecture halls and buildings should
be equally accessible. And in those that are
accessible, students with disabilities are often
forced to sit in the back of the room - away
from the rest of the students. Furthermore,
the jam-packed lecture halls of the Chemistry
Building and Natural Science Building aren't
only poorly accessible, but overcrowded and
congested as well. These issues do not only
affectstudents with disabilities, but the class-
ro0m experience as well.
Students with disabilities should have more
opportunities to get involved on campus. For

example, the University's Department of Rec-
reational Sports needs to work to include these
students on their IM sports teams by creating
leagues in which everyone can get involved -
much like a co-ed league. Also, there could be
leagues devoted to students with disabilities.
The University of Illinois and Ohio State Uni-
versity, among other colleges, already have
competitive wheelchair sports teams of their
own. The University needs to be an active part-
ner to disabled Wolverines and implement a
similar league here.
More often than not, disability awareness
goes unnoticed on campus. Students and fac-
ulty aren't aware of the issues students with
disabilities face on a daily basis and the stig-
mas often associated with such identities. As
a University that stands to promote diver-
sity, acceptance and open-mindedness, the
administration needs to play a larger role in
ensuring that all students are able to engage
in the extracurricular activities offered
through our University, as well as create an
accessible and accepting environment for the
entire student body.

highest bidder.
So what now? The court has
ruled and now we must live with it,
right? Wrong! On Wednesday, Con-
gressman John Dingell (D-Mich.)
spoke at the Ford School of Public
Policy explaining his new legisla-
tion that, if passed, could reinstate
some vital elements of campaign
fundraising laws. Appropriately
cited as the Restoring Confidence
in Our Democracy Act, this bill
would prohibit corporations and
unions from buying advertising
supporting campaign causes and
would force super PACs to abide by
the same $5,000 donation limit as
regular PACs.
As Dingell made clear at the
event, this bill certainly isn't going
to solve every problem within our
campaign system, but it's definitely
agood start. Our democratic system
is slowly but surely being auctioned
off to the highest bidder. We need
to reinstate some sort of order to a
system that has become popularly
known as the "wild, wild west."
I highly doubt Franklin envi-
sioned Citizens United when he
ominously answered that woman's
question on the steps of Indepen-
dence Hall. Regardless of what
he meant with that statement, the
United States now faces a colossal
threat. Whether or not our republic
survives, only time will tell.

Should the policies at the Ross School of
Business be changed? Are they unfair to other
students? Shouldtheybe extendedtotheentire
University? According to the reasons present-
ed in a recent editorial in The Michigan Daily,
("Bad Business", 3/14/13) the Business Schools'
policies are overwhelmingly negative. The
article criticizes its grade inflation and lack of
Friday classes. However, understanding why
the Business School holds these policies proves
the beliefthat it's essential that the administra-
tion change the inequities that exist between
colleges is misguided.
Grade Inflation at Ross
Grade inflation at Ross is no secret. The
average Ross student's grade point average
is about 3.6 while the University's average
rests at about 3.3. There's a large discrepancy,
but this entire argument is moot as GPAs are
mostly compared relative to which school a
student is enrolled in. Every program at this
University has . completely different grade
distributions, so comparing GPAs in absolu-
tion is known to be impractical. Insisting that
inflated grades will fool employers is insult-
ing to those employers' intelligences.
But this begs the question, what good comes
from Ross inflating its grades? Ross believes
its program will be strong if it devalues the
importance of GPA. Basically, Ross wants its
students to prove themselves outside the class-
room. This, in turn, causes students to focus
on achieving more in other extracurricular
activities. As for the matter thatgrade inflation
ill-prepares Ross students for the real world,
recruiters ranked Ross students fifth overall
in Business Week's 2012 Bachelor's of Business
Administration rankings, and they continue to
come to Ross every year. The grade inflation at
Ross does work well, as students continue to
land top jobs year in and year out - the main
goal for business schools.
Other top business schools might not have
the same grade inflation, but that is their own
concern. Ross should not change its grading
policy because it's not the same as others - it
should have policies that align with its goal of
preparing its students for the business world.
In the end, the quality of Ross is not dictated
by nominal GPAs, but by the quality of students
the program creates.
'No Friday Class' Policy
The article then moves on to the Ross policy
that no business classes are scheduled on Fri-

days. The author does an excellent job explain-
ing why the Business School has Fridays off,
only missing the point that second-round
interviews are usually held on Fridays.
Ross also has a number of unique policies
outside of grading that contribute to the Bach-
elor in Business Administration program's
high rankings in publications like U.S. News
and World's. For example, Businessjuniors and
seniors have an extra week added to their win-
ter break in order to seek out internships and
job offers. In addition, Ross avoids scheduling
Friday classes so their students can compete in
case competitions, attendspecial events at Ross
and work on group projects. It's not that Busi-
ness students don't deserve these perks, but if
they're offered to them, they should be offered
to undergraduates across the University.
However, the author fails to mention why
offering this to the rest of the school is a
good idea.
So should these policies be extended to
the rest ofthe University?
These policies should not be extended just
because of the sole fact that Ross has them.
If the author believes Fridays should be off
for all students, he or she should prove how
cramming a five-day school week into four
days for 24,000 undergraduates is beneficial.
This would make for a much stronger argu-
ment than, "others have this perk that helps
their program, so I want it also." If I want
Ross to lower its tuition by $900 per semes-
ter to match LSA, I would need to prove how
this is beneficial to the program. The burden
of proof is on me.
In the end, every college here has unique
goals, so these "entitlements" will always exist.
Therefore, it makes no sense to force superfi-
cial equality on our diverse programs. It would
be disadvantageous for everyone if the actions
taken by one college to improve itself were
misapplied to others with different priorities
or diluted ina misguided effort to share every-
thing. This isn't about equality - it's about
doing what is best for each program. Each col-
lege should adopt policies that provide its stu-
dents with the best curriculum. By taking this
approach, rather than forcing each college to
have the same policies, students at the Univer-
sity will receive atop-notch education tailored
to the ideals of each program.

"Find a husband on campus
before you graduate."
What once seemed tobe the out-
dated motto of a lost generation of
housewives has resurfaced thanks
to Princeton University alum Susan
Patton. In a letter to The Daily
Princetonian, Patton explains that
these intelligent girls aren't going
to be satisfied marrying someone
less intelligent than they are and
that in general society, men pre-
fer women who are younger and
dumber. Therefore, the girls' most
suitable matches are at Princeton.
"Look around you," she said when
discussing her letter. "These are the
best guys." These comments have
sparked considerable controversy.
Patton's overgeneralizations are
as inaccurate as they are harmful.
They illustrate close-mindedness
and blatant arrogance. To say that
Princeton men are the best: that
no one else in the world is good
enough - anywhere - is just ridic-
ulous. Her comments are encourag-
ing Princeton girls to turn up their
noses at the rest of the world, to
believe there is nothing better for
them in society than what they can
get at Princeton. It's a great school,
but it's not the be-all-end-all of edu-
cation. There are only about 7,500
students at Princeton, undergradu-
ates and graduates combined. That
makes for a very small pool of suit-
ors and doesn't even begin to cover
the diversity of 7-billion people on
the planet. If we really want to find
that special someone, being pre-
tentious enough to whittle down

this number to a few thousand
is impractical.
I've seen some of this same
arrogance at our own university.
We're at a good school and like to
tell people that. It's not that we
should think any less of ourselves
or the University, but there's a dif-
ference between thinking you're
awesome and thinking everyone
else is beneath you. Even with our
40,000 students, I have my reserva-
tions in believing that one of those
is my future husband. We need to
be open-minded about life in gen-
eral, so thinking that you're above
99.99 percent of the global popula-
tion just because of the school you
go to is plain ignorance.
But, of course, this exhibition of
arrogance was not all that I found
distasteful. If I were a man, I sup-
pose I would be angered by her
assumptions that men prefer dumb
girls with pretty faces. But being a
woman, I found her suggestion of
using college like eHarmony offen-
sive. Though Patton's reasoning
is supported by her opinion that
Princeton girls are so superior in
intelligence and skill that they will
have trouble findinga partner good
enough, the mere suggestion that
college should be a place to find a
husband is an injustice.
College is a time to embrace
curiosity, exploration and selfish-
ness. It's about self-discovery and
self-actualization, not about fit-
ting our lives into the perfect little
1950s family. Haven't we, as women,
expanded our motivations beyond

just finding a husband? How has it
become so crucial to find a "good
man" that women are told to snag
one as soon as they can in order to
avoid ... what?
Those terrible, long, lonely years
of being independent and doing
something for themselves by them-
selves? I'm not against marriage,
even early marriage. But it's barbar-
ic to think that college is aplace that
women should be running around
like ravenous lionesses, constantly
searching for an antelope to dig
their claws into.
It's people like Patton who won't
let women move beyond these deep-
rooted stereotypes. Itdoesn't matter
that society sees women as strong
and capable individuals, there's still
an invisible string pulling back to
those traditional roles. Men aren't
told to marry in college. They're
encouraged to explore their options,
find a stable career and maybe settle
down with a family when they're
good and ready. But for women,
time is still considered our biggest
enemy, and it's not just people like
Patton that remind us. We do it to
ourselves. But whether or not mar-
riage is in our futures, the impor-
tance of gaining an education and
exploring this crazy, liberal world
of college shouldn't be marred with
talk of marriage and the constant
race to find "Mr. Right." These four
years are aboutus.We can't afford to
waste our time.

What's the officer, problem?
Talking with'Breakers'

Ebert was the first film critic to win a Pulitzer Prize.
Iremembrance
of Roger Ebert

Film critic leaves
legacy after battling
thyroid cancer
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily B-Side Editor
Roger Ebert, arguably the
greatest and without doubt the
most identifiable film critic of
the 20th century, died yesterday
as a result of recurring compli-
cations from an extended bat-
tle with thyroid cancer. It was
the same thyroid cancer that
sidelined him from "Ebert &
Roeper," the same cancer that
robbed him of that calm, mea-
sured voice and the same cancer
that, for seven years, couldn't
keep him from writing about
movies.
And when you look past all
the touching goodbyes that'll be
published in the next few days, I
think, at least for a moment, it'll
become clear what made Ebert
Ebert: not the unending stream
of book deals or the hyper-
influential television shows that
gave him as much recognition
as many of the movies he wrote
about, but a stubborn resilience
- a dedication to keep moving
forward and doingwhathe knew
he loved.
At this point, many of you
pessimists will probably become
disgruntled by my use of the
phrase "doing what he loved"
and dismiss this homage-slash-
eulogy like you would of some-
one who brings a Hallmark card
to a funeral. My 14-year-old self
would agree with you; the whole
"following your dream" part is
old, a phrase thrown around in
the third act of feel-good mov-.
ies in a vain attempt to make two
hours and $10 spent at the movie
theater mean something. But
after a certain point, maybe it'll
be an essay you'll write or a book
you'll read that unveils some
sense of undiminished clarity,
you stop feeling superior to the
content that you examine. For
me, that moment came when I
took an active interest in watch-
ing movies.
For Roger Ebert, that moment
came when he started writing
about the movies he watched.
In "Awake in the Dark: The Best
of Roger Ebert," he describes

how, while writing his first few
reviews, he left the movie the-
ater, formulating the "exact
angle of condescension" that
would forever define his take
on cinema. A clever phrase,
bemoaning the abysmal state
of Hollywood already floating
around in his mind.
Even as the most fledgling of
fledgling film critics, I can tell
you confidently that this form
of acerbic writing gets old and
alienating. Fast. What allowed
Ebert to gain traction with a
mainstream audience and let
film criticism, as a discernible
form of writing in and of itself,
gain hold within the world of
professional journalism, is his
willingness to accept movies
open-mindedly because, just
when he'd given up on ever lov-
ing his job, he described how "a
movie would open that disarmed
my defenses and left me ecstatic
and joyful."
With that openness came the
belief that accessible writing
wasn't synonymous with stu-
pidity or easiness. The crucial
difference was trusting your
audience to follow your argu-
ments, no matter how thorough
or complex. As long as you took
the time to keep them engaged
in a way that let them argue
back, you could give yourself the
opportunity to have a conversa-
tion with them - and at its core,
that's what writing reviews is all
about.
The first words I ever wrote
about a film weren't directly
inspired by that film, but by
Ebert's two-star review of it.
I'm talking about "Fight Club,"
David Fincher's frantically styl-
ized depiction of youth's naive
"fuck you" to creeping com-
mercialization. Enraged at the
mocking review, I wrote, "Wtf
is Ebert thinking. This shit
genius." Words not exactly rep-
resentative of a film connois-
seur, but a response nonetheless.
And that's what mattered: The
review got a response out of me
without being alarmist bullshit.
As someone who (at the time)
was afraid to admit that he was
developing an unhealthy habit
of watching three movies every
night, this was a major develop-
ment.
In his last few days, Ebert did
something he'd always avoided:

He took an indefinite "leave of
presence" (the title of his last
blog) from his writing. In his
essay, "I do not fear death,"
Ebert writes, "I know it is com-
ing, and I do not fear it, because
I believe there is nothing on the
other side of death to fear," pro-
fessing his ultimate understand-
ing of the inevitable. He seems
at peace with what everyone
knows will happen, but he never
mentions how he will lose what
has been one of the most signifi-
cant parts of his life: his writing.
In his blog, he promised he'd
still be there and would be taking
steps to produce more content,
but this was clearly a goodbye,
a noticeable waver in confi-
dence that I'd never before seen
in Ebert's writing. The reviews,
blog posts, tweets and Facebook
updates that had always been
on the Internet, symbols of the
critic's perseverance, would stop
appearing and eventually patter
out of relevance.
As I think about Ebert's life, I
keep goingback to his farewell to
Gene Siskel, his longtime cohost
of "Siskel & Ebert," who passed
away in 1999 after a bout with
a cancerous brain tumor. In the
opening statement, Ebert looks
too at ease, as if trying too hard
to maintain the air of compo-
sure that for so long had defined
the extraordinarily popular
show that made him famous.
He speaks at length about Sis-
kel's passion for his work and
how, despite his diagnosis and
surgery, he kept coming in to do
recordings of the show and how
he phoned in reviews from his
hospital bed. For a brief moment,
he pauses and points to the now-
empty movie theater seat next
to him, describing how just a
month ago, Siskel was sitting
right there, talking about mov-
ies.
I can't help but think Ebert's
passion is a reflection of what
he learned in his time with Sis-
kel, of the bond that they formed
while sitting down and talking
about movies - a bond that he
formed and strengthened every
week with every one of his read-
ers.
In the last sentence of his last
blog post, Ebert wrote, "See you
at the movies." Save me a seat,
buddy. I'm looking forward to
talking.

Spring break forever, bitches.
If you're at all aware of the
film "Spring Breakers," written
and directed by Harmony Korine
("Trash Humpers"), then you've
probably heard those words at
least a dozen times in its trailers
and promotional videos. Korine,
famous for supposedly flipping
off director Larry Clark upon
first meeting, then writing the
script for Clark's film "Kids" in
three weeks, explores this (in)
famous tradition in his latest
project. So, why "Spring Break-
ers?" Why now? And, at the end,
will you really want spring break
to go on forever (bitches)?
"I felt like I needed to make
(the movie) just because I liked
the storyline, and I liked the
characters; it was a world I want-
ed toexplore. Is it areflection? ... I
think it's connected to youth cul-
ture in some way," Korine said in
a conference call with The Michi-
gan Daily on March 25.
"But at the same time, it's - it
was never meant to be a kind of
documentary or an expose on
something ... It's something that's
more like a pop poem, or almost
like the real world but pushed
into something more kind of - I
don't know - hyper-poetic. And
it is kind of - it works on its own
logic ... it's connected to the cul-
ture, and maybe there's a zeitgeist
in some way. But it's also some-
thing separate."
Star Ashley Benson (TV's
"Pretty Little Liars") joined
Korine in discussing the film.

Benson, a four-year vet of the themes of this film, which, along

JoBros drop 'Poms'
Boy band makes
quiet return

with new single
By GIBSON JOHNS
Daily Online Editor
I don't know about you, but
I had no idea the Jonas Broth-
ers were planning to release new
music together, and the lack of fan-
fare surrounding the band's new
single "Pom Poms" is both ironic
and unsettling.
Five years ago, the Jonas Broth-
ers were on top of the world: Their
album A Little BitLonger sold over
500,000 copies in its first week,
Joe Jonas was dating T-Swift,
their single "Burnin' Up" was ines-
capable, and Nick Jonas was the
talk of the town for his are-they-
aren't-they romance with Miley
Cyrus. 'JB' stood for 'Jonas Broth-
ers'back then, not 'Justin Bieber.'
But then, after their fourth.
album Lines, Vines and Trying
Times failed to make an impact,
the group took a hiatus and the
brothers went in their own direc-
tions. Joe had a failed attempt at a
solo career, Nick was on "Smash"
and wrote a song about Miley's
engagement to Liam Hemsworth
and Kevin starred in "Married
To Jonas," a reality show on E!
about his marriage to high-school
sweetheart Danielle Deleasa.
While the boys were gone,
Bieber and

I'm coolin' down for you, baby.
the void that the JoBros left in the
market, and preteen girls every-
where forgot what a Jonas even
was. Out were the purity ring-
wearing brothers from Jersey and
in was a troublemaking bunch
of tattooed British boys and an
Usher protege who's making
headlines for allegedly smoking
pot and sleeping with Rihanna.
Don't get me wrong, One Direc-
tion and Bieber are still making
music that is very much bubble-
gum, but you get the sense that
both acts are itching to move into
more mature territory.
Which brings me back to
"Pom Poms." In 2008, the release
of a new Jonas Brothers song
would've guaranteed its quick
ascension to the iTunes top spot,
yet "Pom Poms," 24 hours after its
release, sat at No. 8 on the charts.
Not bad, but there's no question
that the JoBros have lost part of
their original audience as ex-fans
endure their final years of high
school or enter college. The music

video, also released Tuesday, has
less than 300,000 hits on You-
Tube. Consideringthatthe Biebs's
video for "Beauty and a Beat" gar-
nered 10.6 million hits in one day
last year, those numbers are pret-
ty bleak.
And this is all for a song that
is arguably one of the better boy-
band songs released in a while.
With its callback chorus backed
by horns and a strong drumline,
"Pom Poms," for the most part,
shows a maturation in the JoBros'
sound, previously known for juve-
nile songs like "Year 3000." That
being said, it's clear that Nick,
Joe and Kevin haven't completely
abandoned what they're known
for (see: the female vocal section
intended to sound like cheerlead-
ers), but it's a definite step in the
right direction.
Now, we'll just have to see if
their fans will follow them there.

Wilson dangerous at safety

Blue readies
for rivalry

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner has been picked
off a few times by the safeties dur-
ing the Michigan football team's
spring practice, though he's too
embarrassed to talk about it.
Even if he's ashamed to admit
it, Gardner still acknowledges
his picks mean
the safeties NOTEBOOK
are effectively
doing their job in reading his
passes. And one in particular is
gettingincreasingly better atthat.
Sophomore Jarrod Wilson has
been pegged with the difficult
task of replacing Jordan Kovacs at
safety alongside fifth-year senior
Thomas Gordon, and throughout
the spring he has continued to
solidify his spot as the presumed
starter.
For defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison, the most impressive
thing about Wilson during spring
ball is the fact that he's still peak-
ing.
"He's a very consistent football
player," Mattison said. "A lot of
times young guys will show you
the flashes of why you recruited
them, and then you'll see, 'Oh
man, he's stepped back.' This
guy's continued to improve."
Wilson calls himself a "student
of the game." He has books full of
notes and spends countless hours
watching film both during prac-
tices and when he returns to his
dorm at the end of the day.
Even with all the extra work
he puts in, Wilson might consider
himself first and foremost a stu-
dent of Kovacs.
The former captain has been in
and out of Ann Arbor this winter,
dropping by Schembechler Hall
periodically for workouts, and
though Wilson really hasn't had
the opportunity to pick Kovacs's
brain, the year he spent observ-
ing Kovacs while on reserve has
given him insight into the kind of
safety he's striving to be.
"His instincts and what to

Junior defensive end Frank Clark is part of a deep rotation of pass rushers. Michigan has enough depth to keep fresh

expect even before the play has
even started," Wilson said of
what he's picked up by watch-
ing Kovacs. "He could come out
and tell you what the offense was
going to run due to line splits,
wide-receiver splits, quarterback
and everything. I pretty much
learned pre-snap reads from
him."
I MOUSTACHE YOU ABOUT
THE O-LINE: Though he gets
along with everyone on the team,
sophomore tight end Devin
Funchess isn't quite sure where
he fits in with the rest of the
offensive linemen.
"I can't hang out with the line-
men because I can't grow facial
hair," Funchess joked. "I'm just a
young lad."
Funchess was referring to the
moustaches that the linemen
are growing as a form of solidar-
ity. And though he's just kidding
about not being able to associate
with them, his observations on
the solidarity of the offensive line
are very real.
That chemistry is what's hold-
ing the line together throughout
spring practices, and it's what
offensive coordinator Al Borges

hopes will translate to effective-
ness when the season starts.
"It's a lot of awareness, a
lot of chemistry, hearing calls,
responding to the calls, stepping
right," Borges said. "There's not
a heck of a lot of margin for error
sometimes. That takes time. It's
just not something that happens
right away."
Off-the-field brunch trips to
Benny's Family Dining aside,
the offensive line seems unusu-
ally cohesive on the field this
spring after it struggled as a unit.
Though the line will no doubt
benefit from the leadership of
fifth-year senior left tackle Taylor
Lewan after his decision to forgo
the NFL Draft, Michigan also has
has a veteran in fifth-year senior
right tackle Michael Schofield.
Redshirt sophomore Chris Bryant
will compete with redshirt fresh-
man Kyle Kalis and Ben Braden
for the guard position. Early on,
Kalis seems to be the favorite.
Redshirt sophomore Jack Mill-
er is the presumed startingcenter,
and Borges anticipates the past
two years Miller spent watching
former Wolverines David Molk
and Elliott Mealer will ease his

transition.
"Jack's smart, he'll do fine,"
Borges said. "He won't make very
many errors. Now the center a lot
of times puts the whole line on the
right page, so to speak. Jack had
played enough. Jack does a pretty
good job of doing that."
RUSH HOUR: Since Mattison
arrived at Michigan two years
ago, he's had a dream: Soon, he
hopes the day will come when he
doesn't want his defensive line-
men to blitz on a third down.
The vision? That the Wolver-
ines' pass rush is effective enough
that linemen can take care of the
quarterback all on their own.
Mattison admitted that in the
past, Michigan has struggled
with the pass rush in a four-man
front. But now, with the linemen
setting themselves apart and
makingstrides this spring, Matti-
son's optimistic that day isn't too
far away.
"That's going to be a trademark
of this defense before we're all
done," Mattison said. "That gives
the linebackers and the second-
ary a little more relief and allows
them to play their position a little
better."

Daily Sports Writer
Oh, what a difference a year
makes.
Last season, the then-No. 20
Michigan softball team stumbled
into Columbus after an unchar-
acteristically slow start to the
season. The Wolverines began
Big Ten play hitting just .249 as a
team. Meanwhile, Ohio State was
riding an eight-game winning
streak heading into the matchup.
Despite a hostile crowd at Buck-
eye Field, the Wolverines complet-
ed the three-game sweep in what
was their best performance of the
season. The offense totaled a sea-
son-high 16 hits in an 11-4 win over
the Buckeyes in the first game of a
doubleheader on Saturday before
taking a 6-4 decision in the second
contest to complete the sweep.
It was a weekend that secured
sole position of first place atop the
Big Ten for the Wolverines, and
they never looked back.
This season, the 12th-ranked
Wolverines (6-0 Big Ten, 28-7
overall) will head into rivalry
weekend riding a 10-game win-
ning streak of their own.
Meanwhile, Ohio State (3-3,
21-11) heads to Alumni Field hav-
ing lost two of its last three games
in a home series to Purdue. The
Buckeyes have been plagued by
poor pitching of late. Junior right-
hander Melanie Nichols, one of
the staff's top performers last year,
struggled in non-conference play
and has seen less time in the circle
as a result.
And the Buckeyes' pitching
staff will not want to face the
Michigan offense.
With a red-hot offense that has
produced 62 runs at Alumni Field
through six games, the Wolver-
ines remain perfect in Big Ten
play. Consistency throughout the
lineup has earned a young Michi-

gan team 13 wins in its last 15
games dating back to early March.
The weekend will be the first
rivalry experience for seven
Michigan freshmen. Shortstop
Sierra Romero and outfielder
Sierra Lawrence - both recently
named to the USA Softball Junior
Women's National Team - will be
key features of the offense against
Ohio State pitching. Romero has
been the Wolverines' most pro-
ductive power hitter with 14
home runs and 38 RBI. Of late,
Lawrence has secured her spot in
the starting lineup. In the home
opener against Purdue, Lawrence
went 4-for-9 and is batting .341 on
the season when batting from the
last spot.
"(The rivalry) doesn't intimi-
date me," Lawrence said. "It's still
just one-pitch softball."
As the last team besides Michi-
gan to win an outright Big Ten
title, the Buckeyes represent some
of the tougher competition the
Wolverines will face this season.
Ohio State boasts five players hit-
ting above .300 and returns sev-
eral experienced pitchers to the
lineup.
But if the Wolverines should
be nervous, someone forgot to tell
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins.
"I don't care about anybody
else," Hutchins said. "I only care
about us. I don't care about Ohio
State. It doesn't matter who you
play, you play to win.
"I don't even scout them that
much. It's the game of softball.
Pick up the ball and throw it. Pitch
it, catch it, hit it. It doesn't really
change that much."
In last year's series, senior co-
captain Nicole Sappingfield was
6-for-9 - including a 4-for-4
Saturday - with three RBI. Like
several other Wolverines, Sap-
pingfield has caught fire of late,
improving her batting average to
.357.

Fearing the beam but preparing for pressure at Regionals

Michigan typically scores in

bars and floor, but its season high
on beam is only a 49.275 that was
earned at the very first meet of
the season, the Cancun Classic, on
Jan. 4.
Despite lower scores on beam,
the Wolverines are encouraged by
their capability to perform much
better than their scores reflect on
the event. To prepare for region-
als, they've been focusing on
training for pressure situations.
"It's impossible to create a real
meet-like pressure in practice, but
we do what we can," Plocki said.
Methods to simulate meet set-
tings include pressure sets with
music blasting in the background
to recreate crowd noise, stick

competitions and "team beam,"
in which the lineup competes
and tries to obtain a certain team
score.
The major beam assignment
of the week was originally to
spell out "Regional Champs" by
Wednesday. Everytime a gymnast
scored at least a 9.900 on a beam
routine in practice, she would put
one of the letters up. Because the
Wolverines almost spelled out the
phrase by the end of Monday, the
phrase was extended to "Regional
Champions," and then again, to
"NCAA 2013 Regional Champi-
ons" because of their progress.
The team completed the task on
Wednesday, the day before the
team traveled to West Virginia,
and remarkably, even gymnasts
not in the beam lineup helped
accomplish the letters assignment.

prepared for the upcoming meet,
the team mentality is on point.
Sophomore Annette Miele has
consistently been in the beam
lineup throughoutthis season. She
treats each routine in practice the
same way she does in a meet.
"This is all mental atthis point,"
Miele said.
Michigan has demonstrated a
new level of confidence that was
absent during the previous season.
Rather than let one major mistake
or fall create a domino effect on
the rest of the lineup, this team
is unfazed by the added pres-
sure placed in such high-pressure
instances.
Plocki comes up with a say-
ing each week for the team to live
by. This week's is "If you think
you can or if you think you can't,
you're right."
"What you're telling yourself

is what you believe," Plocki said.
"What you believe is what your
reality is, and if you believe you're
not good, you're not going to be
good. If you believe you're good,
you have a lot better of a chance of
being good, but youhave to believe
that you're great if you want to
go out there and win a National
Championship."
The Wolverines hope to place
in the top two at Regionals to
advance to the NCAA Champion-
ships, held in Los Angeles. The
last time Michigan was in Califor-
nia, the team scored a season-best
197.550 on March 10.
"We need to do what we do,"
Plocki said. "We need to be as
good as we are. We need to per-
form the same way on Saturday
that we have during the bulk of the

never had the talented roster he

At West Virginia, Beilein mold-

though he saw some tournament
success, Beilein never reached a
Final Four.
Now, Beilein's roster is filled
with potential NBA talent in
Burke, Hardaway Jr. and fresh-
man forward Glenn Robinson III,
and he's made his deepest tourna-
ment run by allowing his players
to create for themselves, instead of
molding them to his system.
But where Beilein has the ability
to coach the talent, Boeheim has
years of tournament experience.
Though Boeheim hasn't brought
Syracuse to a Final Four in 10

The Wolverines' roster is filled

with young players, with five

But youth has also been an issue
for Michigan, especially in the Big

Michigan gets creative to simulate,
Syracuse's length as semifinallooms

For NBA probables, a final send-off

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
ATLANTA - The last home
practice for the 2012-13 Michigan
men's basketball team didn't look
normal.
Sure, the mood was loose Tues-
day, with players nodding their
heads to the piped-in music play-
ing overhead during a post-practice
dunk contest, but there were some
oddities.
Mainly the fact that 6-foot-10
senior forward Blake McLimans,
a reserve, was the scout team's
player tasked with simulating the
top of Syracuse's famed 2-3 zone.
Syracuse has such length that the
Wolverines were forced to use one
of their tallest players to simulate
Orange point guard Michael Cart-
er-Williams, who is 6-foot-6.
On top of that, Michigan coach
John Beilein implemented a new
drill for his perimeter players. A
whistle sounded during offensive
run throughs, and whichever Wol-
verine had the ball had to jack up a
shot, even if they were three to four
feet behind the 3-point line.
Twenty-eight-foot shots and
centers playing the top of a zone -
that's the type of practice required
to master the Orange's defense.
For much of the week, much
attention hasbeen paid to this zone,
put in place by legendary Syra-
cuse coach Jim Boeheim, and how
Beilein would attack it. The two are
friends and have roots back to when
Beilein coached at Canisius in the
1990s.
Beilein's offense is, and always
has been, built around players who
can shoot. He's never beat Boeheim
in nine attempts, but he's also never
had quite the repertoire of shooters
that he does now.
Is that abigdeal?
"We are going to try and make
it a big deal," said sophomore point
guard Trey Burke, the straw that
stirs the drink for the Michigan
offense. "We understand that they
are really long and successful in
that zone. My job is to make sure we
are moving the ball, not just stand-
ing around but making them move
and try and hit the open man."
As he has been for the entire sea-
son, Burke will be at the forefront of
the offensive attack. Even though
2B1 Final Four, April 5, 2013

Carter-Williams has six inches
on the recently crowned Associ-
ated Press Player of the Year, Burke
will still be asked to penetrate the
impenetrable to keep Michigan's
offense fluid. Burke's drives set up
Michigan's shooters, specifically
freshman guard Nik Stauskas, who
made all six of his 3-point attempts
against Florida in the Elite Eight
last weekend. The consensus is that
if Michigan can shoot like it did
against the Gators, when it made 46
percent of its shots from the field,
the Wolverines can advance to the
championship game.
Playing Syracuse this Saturday
instead of last Sunday makes a big
difference, though. Beilein and the
Wolverines have six days to prepare
for the zone, instead of the two that
they had to prepare against Florida.
For a young team, that could
make all the difference.
"Before, we got like 36 hours to
cram in all this information," Staus-
kas said. "Sometimes, when you're
sitting in film for a couple hours, all
the information doesn't really sink
in just because it's so much at once.
Dividing it up over five or six days
makes ita lot easier to take in."
This is a team that's finding its
stride at just the perfect time after
a mid-season swoon during which
the Wolverines lost three of four
games at one point and finished 6-6
in their last 12 games.
It turns out the answers were
never too far out of reach for the
seniors who had their last-ever
practice at Crisler Center on Tues-
day. The team had to slow down and
regroup, needing a slight infusion
of confidence to catapult it back to
a place commensurate with its tal-
ent level.
Now, afterweathering the storm
and becoming one of the last four
teams standing, Michigan has
found its stride, even if that stride
involved a 6-foot-10 reserve acting
as the opposing team's point guard.
"I never though we were in
trouble," said senior guard Corey
Person. "The thing that I saw, that
always kept me in high spirits, was
that in a lot of the games we were
losing, the mistakes that we were
making were a lot of the same mis-
takes. It wasn't something big, like
we needed someone to grow three
inches, or that we needed to be

Daily Sports Editor
A report by sports business
reporter Darren Heitner, citing an
unnamed source, surfaced Thurs-
day saying both junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. and sophomore point
guard Trey Burke are prepared to
forgo their final years of college eli-
gibility to head to the NBA as soon
as the Michigan men's basketball
team's run ends. The families of
both players denied the report.
Three other freshmen - guard
Nik Stauskas and forwards Mitch
McGary and Glenn Robinson III -
appear destined to have eventual
professional careers, as well.
In the meantime, this past week
has given these future pros a spe-
cial appreciation for the uniqueness
of life on a college campus.
That began just hours after the
Wolverines defeated Florida in the
Elite Eight, 79-59, as more than
1,000 University students congre-
gated outside Crisler Center to wel-
come the team back.
"That was very special," Robin-
son said. "I don't know how many
students there were but we couldn't
even drive through the parking lot.
People were banging on the bus and
as soon as we got off, everyone was
just waiting for us.

almost.
Hardaway and McGary each had
papers to turn in the following day,
and Robinson said that an athletic
department official checked in to
make sure he showed up on time to
his 10 a.m. class Monday morning.
Aside from being in class for
the first few days of this week -
the team departed for Atlanta on
Wednesday afternoon - the play-
ers are hardly normal students,
despite the 6-foot-10 McGary's best
attempts to stay "incognito," which
he admitted isn't an easy thing to
do. But the freshman is going to
try to stay under the radar for at
least another year, as he announced
on Tuesday that he's returning to
Michigan for his sophomore year
next season.
"We're normal people, and we've
got to do those things, and we've
got to get our work done," Robin-
son said, who then listed a host of
abnormalities he's encountered this
week, includingstudents approach-
ing him with ticket requests and
teachers congratulating him in
front of crowded lecture halls. "It's
been crazy. Everyone's been com-
ing up and talking to us."
This week marked the one-year
anniversary of when Burke - who
according to several reports had,
for a time, decided last year to
declare for the draft - held a press

conference to announce he'd return
to Michigan.
Spending his sophomore season
in Ann Arbor has proven to be the
right decision. Burke, a consen-
sus All-American, has enhanced
his draft stock from fringe sec-
ond rounder last spring to a likely
lottery pick in June's draft. On
Thursday, he was awarded both the *
Associated Press National Player of
the Year and Bob Cousy Award for
the country's top point guard.
And though he has excelled on
the court, his time off it has proved
equally rewarding. His time at
Michigan is something that he says
he'll certainly miss.
"That hits me all the time, really,
just because the-college atmosphere
is so great," Burke said.
It was at that press conference
last year that Burke said his inten-
tions were to compete for a Nation-
al Championship, a statement that
many around the country scoffed
at.
Now, with the Wolverines just
two wins from the title, Burke's
words appear prophetic.
"I just understood the type of
talent we had coming in and the
type of talent we had returning, you
know, the talent to put together a
run like we've put together," Burke
said. "We're here now. We just still
have unfinished business."

"I don't know if I'll ever be a part
of something like that again. I was
enjoying that moment."
Several players, including Robin-
son, took out their phones to record
the experience as Michigan coach
John Beilein and the team's four
captains took hold of police mega-
phones to address the crowd and
turn it into a pep rally.
"I don't know if you're ever going
to see something like that in the
NBA," Stauskas said. "The fact that
we have the support from all the
fans here and that they waited for
us to come back, it was cool."
Two days before the win over

the Gators, no one had a better
seat to witness Burke's game-tying
3-pointer to send Michigan into
overtime against Kansas in the
Sweet Sixteen than Beilein. But
reflecting back on that moment, the
headman lightheartedly joked that
he wishes he had a different van-
tage point.
"I wish I could beam into a res-
taurant here and watch everybody
watch Trey's shot go in," Beilein
said. "I probably would be right
there with them."
But when the parking lot cel-
ebration ended, it was back to nor-
mal for the student-athletes. Well,

A potent offense meets an impenetrable zone

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
It's the final weekend of the
NCAA Tournament, and the Michi-
gan men's basketball team is still
playing.
After breezing through the open-
ing weekend, then upsetting top-
seeded Kansas and demolishing
Florida en route to their first Final
Four in 20 years, the Wolverines
will take on Syracuse in Saturday's
national semifinal.
The Daily basketball beat breaks
down the matchup.
Michigan offense vs. Syracuse
defense
It's the matchup everybody's
been waiting to see: How will the
Wolverines' fast-paced, Trey Burke-
focused offense handle the daunt-
ing 2-3 zone that held Marquette
to a tournament-low 39 points and
Indiana to SO points.
38 Final Four, April 5, 2013

Syracuse's long, athletic play-
ers fit perfectly into coach Jim
Boeheim's defensive scheme with
their ability to close out on shooters
quickly and cause turnovers - the
Orange causes 15.6 turnovers per
game.
Syracuse also does a great job
shutting down shooters. It rendered
Indiana's Jordan Hulls and Mar-
quette's Vander Blue ineffective
from the field (Hulls went 0-for-6
and Blue went 3-for-15) and will
look to do the same with fresh-
man guard Nik Stauskas and junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
But Michigan is prepared to mold
its offense around the zone. The
Wolverines have worked on shoot-
ing from well beyond the 3-point
line to avoid blocks on closeouts by
the lanky guards, and the forwards
have practiced high-low sets to try
to find space in the low post.
Michigan likes to runa pick-and-
roll offense that gives Burke the
ability to drive off the screen, dump

it in the post or kick out to a shooter.
The zone will most likely neutralize,
the drive, but Michigan can break
down the orange defense with
good ball rotation and ball fakes.
If Michigan can get out in transi-
tion to prevent Syracuse from set-
ting up its zone or if it can find a hot
shooting hand, the Wolverines can
overcome the zone.

Michigan defense vs. Syracuse
offense
Michigan has struggled to play
40 minutes of good defense all sea-
son, but it seems to have found some
sort of rhythm in the tournament.
Entering the tournament, one of
the biggest questions was whether
freshman forward Mitch McGary
would be able to play defense after
earning the starting spot over red-
shirt junior forward Jordan Mor-
gan.
Luckily for the Wolverines,

McGary stepped up in the tourna-
ment both by playing tough defense
in the paint and by limiting oppo-
nents to one-and-done possessions.
McGary shut down Kansas' Jeff
Withey in the Sweet Sixteen match-
up, and the backcourt of Burke and
Hardaway has been solid.
But Michigan hasn't seen a set
of guards like Michael Carter-Wil-
liams and Brandon Triche. Carter-
Williams has been the story of the
tournament for the Orange on both
sides of the ball.
The 6-foot-6 sophomore is the
team's leading scorer, averaging 13
points per game in the tournament.
Carter-Williams is six inches taller
than Burke, which will be a match-
up issue, but if Hardaway guards
Carter-Williams, Burke is tasked
with guarding the 6-foot-4 Triche.
The Wolverines saw a similarly
built team in Virginia Common-
wealth in the third round and ended
up blowing the Rams out, but Syra-
cuse's guards are simply more tal-

ented and athletic. Michigan will
not only have a tough task guarding
Carter-Williams, but playing a full
40 minutes of good defense.
Edge: Syracuse
Bench
For the majority of the tourna-
ment, Syracuse has used an eight-
man rotation, but center Baye
Moussa Keita is the only bench
player to see significant minutes,
as he shares time with forward
Rakeem Christmas.
The Orange will always have
a fresh big man in the game with
Keita and Christmas splitting min-
utes, but foul trouble could be an
issue for the two. And if Syracuse
brings another guard off the bench,
it doesn't have the talent to replace
Carter-Williams and Triche. Yet
the duo is used to playing a majority
of the game, so fatigue might not be
an issue.
