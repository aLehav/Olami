ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

New initiatives, 
evaluative process 
kick in a year after 
Schlissel arrives

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel 
and his administra-
tion have spent the 
last 
academic 
year 

working to roll out new 

policy initiatives regarding sever-
al campus issues — most notably, 
athletics, diversity, sexual assault, 
alcohol abuse and Greek life. The 
Michigan Daily concludes this 
week’s “Campus Context” series 
by delving into the chain of events 
that has led to a closer examina-
tion of the University’s approach 
toward sexual assault on campus.

The overview: Though dis-

cussion of sexual assault on col-
lege campuses has generated 
discussion in the past, the case of 
former football kicker Brendan 
Gibbons brought the issue into 
the increased public focus. In 
January 2014, the Daily reported 
that Gibbons had been perma-

nently separated from the Uni-
versity for violating the school’s 
Student Sexual Misconduct Poli-
cy — four years after the case had 
been reported.

The delay brought into ques-

tion the efficacy of the Uni-
versity’s adjudication policies. 
Months later, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education Office for 
Civil Rights opened an investiga-
tion into the University and more 
than 100 other schools’ handling 
of sexual assault cases.

Since then, the University has 

been working to improve its pre-
vention programs and make its 
policies more effective and trans-
parent.

The changes: Some changes 

are more visible than others. In 
2013, the University updated 
its sexual misconduct policy 
to meet new standards recom-
mended by the U.S. Department 
of Education. The updated policy 
decreased the burden of proof 
applied in sexual misconduct 
cases. Under the policy, decisions 
require a “preponderance of evi-
dence,” which means an incident 
is more likely to have occurred 
than not. The University took 
part in two sexual assault sur-
veys under Schlissel’s aegis — one 

New technology 
improves ability

In 2004, Eric Betzig was 

unemployed, tinkering in his 
friend Harald Hess’s living room. 
In 2005, he was a research group 
leader at the impressive Janelia 
Research Campus in Virginia 
on his way to winning the 2014 
Nobel Prize in chemistry. The 
tinkering had paid off, leading 
Betzig to invent a microscope 
that saw things no other micro-
scopes could.

Betzig spoke at the Medical 

School on Thursday morning 
about developing the photo-acti-
vated localization microscope, 
or PALM, and gave an overview 
of the recent developments in 
microscopy.

Traditionally, the limiting fac-

tor for microscopes was not their 
magnification. Instead, it was 
a property called “resolution,” 
which refers to the shortest dis-
tance between two separate 
points in a microscope’s field 
of view that can still be distin-
guished as distinct entities. If 
you imagine a microscope as 
drawing a picture, microscopes 
with poor resolution draw with 

Gathering supports 
women’s health org. 
amid accusations, 

controversy

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Students pledged to “Stand 

with Planned Parenthood” in an 
event on the Diag on Thursday to 
show support for the embattled 
women’s health care organiza-
tion.

In recent months, Planned Par-

enthood has faced a firestorm of 
accusations suggesting the non-
profit organization profits from 
the sale of fetal tissue of aborted 
fetuses to medical researchers — 
which would violate federal law. 
In July, an anti-abortion group 
released a series of undercover 
videos featuring Planned Parent-
hood representatives describing 
the process of preserving aborted 
fetuses for research purposes.

LSA senior Amanda Vita, 

co-communications 
chair 
of 

Students for Choice, the organi-
zation that hosted the event, said 
the purpose of the event was to 
show support for the organiza-
tion amid the controversy.

“We are trying to raise support 

for Planned Parenthood amongst 
the media firestorm that’s hap-
pening 
surrounding 
Planned 

Parenthood and all of the con-
gressional opposition,” Vita said. 

“We’re trying to show Planned 
Parenthood that we still stand 
with them.”

Planned 
Parenthood 
has 

repeatedly stated it does not prof-
it from the sale of fetal tissue, and 
that the videos are manipulated 
to create a fabricated message. 
Several state investigations have 
found the organization has not 
mishandled fetal tissue.

The House Oversight Com-

mittee and Government Reform 
Committee grilled Planned Par-
enthood President Cecile Rich-
ards about the videos for more 
than four hours Tuesday, and 
many Republicans threatened 
to block budget resolutions to 
fund the federal government if 
funding for the organization was 
included.

A bill to fund the government 

through December that included 
funding for Planned Parenthood 
was passed Wednesday.

During 
the 
day, 
students 

wrote letters to current Planned 
Parenthood staff members and 
launched an Instagram campaign 
to rally support by taking photos 
of students holding “Stand With 
Planned Parenthood” signs.

By 12:00 p.m., Vita said she 

estimated about 100 students had 
stopped and spoke with members 
of the organization.

“I’m really, really passionate 

about this cause,” said Engineer-
ing sophomore Sonia Thosar, 
who stopped by the event. “I just 
think that women’s bodily auton-

Host Peter Sagal 
talks Greek life, 
Michigan football 
at Hill Auditorium

Daily News Editor

Peter Sagal, host of National 

Public Radio’s “Wait, Wait… 
Don’t Tell Me!,” opened Thurs-
day night’s live show to a sold-

out audience in Hill Auditorium.

Hosted in collaboration with 

public radio affiliate WEMU 
and the Ann Arbor Summer 
Festival, the show returned to 
Ann Arbor for the first time 
since 2007, when it was hosted 
at The Michigan Theater. Pro-
ducers and hosts of the show 
entered the stage clad in maize 
and blue hats and attire. Sagal 
was not hesitant to joke with 
the audience about the Univer-
sity’s recent notoriety in regard 
to student alcohol consumption 

and Greek life.

“This is the first time we have 

been allowed to the University’s 
campus. They had to make sure 
we could handle our liquor — 
I’m hoping to pledge a frat while 
I’m here,” Sagal said.

Sagal continued, referencing 

the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity’s 
suspension following a January 
ski trip incident, saying, “As a 
Jewish man myself, I felt proud.”

The famous quiz show’s spe-

cial guest this week was Uni-
versity lecturer John Bacon, an 

award-winning sports journal-
ist and University alum. Bacon 
is also a member of the Board 
of Student Publications, which 
works with The Michigan Daily.

Having written three of his 

seven books specifically about 
Michigan football, Bacon told 
stories of his time interviewing 
and even training with players. 
By way of explanation for the 
national 
attention 
Michigan 

football receives, Bacon told

Students talk 

about how Black 
identity is defined 

on campus

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Dozens of students crowded 

into the main lobby of Trot-
ter Multicultural Center on 
Thursday for “I’m Black and…” 
— an open discussion that 
parsed the various cultural, 
ethnic and sexual identities 
within the Black community.

Hosted by the Black Student 

Union, the forum was geared 
toward educating students on 

intersectionality — the concept 
of recognizing the intercon-
nections between identities, 
particularly when it comes to 
discrimination.

Public Policy senior Hattie 

McKinney, BSU vice-speaker, 
began the conversation by ask-
ing attendees how they would 
define being Black.

While some attendees said 

Blackness is defined by music, 
dance, hair or fashion, LSA 
sophomore Shavon Edwards 
said she feels Blackness is often 
misdefined by people within 
the Black community.

“I feel like a lot of people in 

our culture define Blackness 
in terms of a textbook defini-
tion and by history, and as we 
all know, history is never told 

in our favor,” she said. “When 
we are describing what Black 
should be, we should not base 
it off of books or how other 
people told us how we were at 
that time. For us to progress 
as a people, we need to come 
up with our own definition of 
what Black is.”

McKinney then extended 

the question and asked attend-
ees to think about what it 
means to be a Black student at 
the University.

Some 
attendees 
said 
it 

means to be from Detroit and 
to be attending the University 
on a need-based scholarship. 
One student said it means to 
be the sole liaison to the Black 
community when any Black

omy is just kind of a basic right 
that you have, so I think it’s really 
amazing that they’re doing this.”

Engineering junior Jake Sat-

terelli, a member of Students for 
Choice, said Planned Parent-
hood’s continued operation was 
important to him because of his 
background.

“It’s important to me because I 

come from a less privileged back-
ground,” Satterelli said. “So I know 
people in the community — espe-
cially women — should have appro-
priate health care and, specifically, 
reproductive health care.”

LSA junior Rachel Crawford, 

vice president of the University’s 

chapter of Students for Life, wrote 
in a statement that the chapter is 
encouraging everyone to watch 
the videos in question and follow 
the professional investigations 
into Planned Parenthood.

“Those who support Planned 

Parenthood are concerned that 
redistributing the federal funding 
of this organization to other wom-
en’s health centers is an attempt 
to restrict abortion access, but at 
the same time are quick to state 
that the federal funding does not 
in any way go towards abortions.”

Students for Life also provided a 

statement on behalf of the chapter.

“Students for Life would like 

to see the federal funds which are 
currently being given to Planned 
Parenthood be redistributed to the 
women’s community health centers 

which provide mammograms and 
other life-saving care,” they wrote.

Music, Theatre & Dance junior 

Katherine Kelley said if students 
don’t actively show their support 
for reproductive health, they are 
in danger of losing resources like 
Planned Parenthood.

“I think if young people don’t 

get up and say that they want it 
to stay, then it’s going to get taken 
down,” Kelley said.

Kelley said she thought the 

demonstration was timely not 
only because of the recent legisla-
tive controversy, but also because 
of misconceptions about repro-
duction she said were present in 
current presidential campaigns.

Notably, in the most recent 

Republican presidential debate, 
former 
Hewlett-Packard 
CEO 

Carly Fiorina, a 2016 GOP presi-
dential 
candidate, 
described 

an exaggerated scene of how 
Planned Parenthood saves fetal 
tissue as she says was presented 
in the undercover videos. Her 
comments — which were later 
debunked — received a thunder-
ous applause.

“Especially with the whole 

presidential campaign going on, 
it seems like a lot of people are 
giving out false information, 
where(as) I think Planned Parent-
hood gives out good information, 
and good help that people need,” 
she said. “It’s a lot more than 
just abortions. It’s a lot of health 
benefits and a lot of education 
that people don’t get elsewhere 
because nobody wants to talk 
about women’s health.”

in the air on ‘hail,’ you are one 
of us.”

To this, Sagal responded, “So 

you say ‘hail,’ not ‘heil,’ right?”

Games played during the 

course of the night included 
“Who’s Bill This Time?” and 
“Not My Job.” The show’s panel-
ists in attendance were comedi-
an Alonzo Bodden, Washington 
Post journalist Roxanne Roberts 
and author Roy Blount Jr.

The audience was composed 

mostly of local Michigan resi-
dents with relatively few Univer-
sity students in attendance. In an 
interview with the Daily, Busi-
ness senior Sarah Burkhardt and 
Public Policy senior Grace Lutfy 
said this was no surprise.

Burkhardt, who is a member 

of Greek life, said she was sym-
pathetic to Sagal’s comments 
about some elements of the Uni-
versity’s reputation.

“I think what they said was 

very true and it shows how peo-

ple outside of our community are 
responding to the news,” Bur-
khardt said. “It’s showing how, 
as college students, we can influ-
ence the news both for good or 
for bad.”

“But that being said, they 

mentioned a lot about Harbaugh 
and that’s something good about 
our community that’s making 
news,” she added.

Burkhardt said she appreci-

ated how the show’s theme cen-
tered on the University.

“We are seniors, so we really 

want to take advantage of these 
alternative opportunities,” Bur-
khardt said. “We could be at 
Rick’s right now but instead we 
are here, broadening our hori-
zons.”

Following the show, Sagal 

and panelists stayed on stage to 
answer questions from the audi-
ence. 

Sagal thanked the audience 

for their attendance, emphasiz-
ing his excitement to be at “one 
of the nation’s number-one party 
schools.”

State rep. talks environment, gun control

Irwin discusses 
state issues with 
impact on students

BY LYDIA PARK

For the Daily

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) addressed the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats on 
what he considered key issues, 
including education, the environ-
ment and equality.

Irwin began his talk on Thurs-

day by stressing the importance 
of the College Democrats as an 
organization.

“I want each of you to think 

about how you can be a part of 
making a community a better 
place,” he said. “I want to encour-
age you to understand that the 
group you’re involved with here 
is a genuinely important group.”

He then moved to one of the 

focuses of his policy agenda: 
education. Irwin discussed the 
problems he has faced in the state 

legislature with funding higher 
education and the effects that has 
on students.

“There was a time in our state’s 

history when you could go to col-
lege — even at a place like this — 
you could work while you were 
here and pay your bills just off 
of a part-time job. It’s not like 
that anymore,” he said. “In my 
parents’ generation, the state of 
Michigan paid for 70 percent of 
the cost of college. Today, based 
on the money that the state leg-
islature appropriates, we are pay-

ing for about 15 percent.”

Irwin then highlighted the 

change in momentum on this 
issue.

“The shift has made it so that 

now we’re talking about student 
debt,” he said. “Now we are real-
izing that this is a tremendous 
weight around the neck of our 
young people. College is supposed 
to be a tool for social mobility, but 
it is not serving its purpose like it 
used to.”

dull crayons while microscopes 
with good resolution draw with 
fine-tipped pencils.

As 
microscopes 
were 

improved, they hit a limit: The 
resolution could never get better 
than half a wavelength of light. 
Since microscopes use light to 
see, they can’t tell the differ-
ence between two objects closer 
together to each other than a ray 
of light. Because of this, micro-
scopes could easily see cells and 
some of the larger objects inside. 
But important interactions such 
as viruses’ infecting a cell or the 
aggregating of proteins that cause 
Alzheimer’s were seen only very 
blurrily, if at all. Betzig, however, 
found a way around this physical 
constraint through PALM.

PALM is a type of fluores-

cent microscopy. In fluorescent 
microscopy, 
the 
microscope 

doesn’t actually see the compo-
nents of a cell, but instead glow-
in-the-dark, 
or 
“fluorescent,” 

molecules that attach themselves 
to the features of interest. The 
problem when attempting to look 
at a super-high-resolution image 
is that each fluorescent molecule 
looks like a fuzzy blob — Betzig 
calls these “fuzzballs” — and 
these blobs start to overlap each 
other.

Betzig found a way through 

this problem by using fluorescent 
molecules that don’t automati-
cally glow, but instead only glow 
when exposed to a certain color 
of light — hence the “photo-acti-
vated” component of PALM. He 
found a way to ensure that only a 
handful of these molecules would 

glow in a given image.

After taking many images, 

with only a few different mol-
ecules glowing in each one, he 
would clean the images so only 
the innermost cores of the fuzz-
balls were visible. Then, all of 
the images would be overlaid 
and the fuzzballs, now just bright 
points of light, would no longer be 
overlapping, thus surpassing the 
theoretical limit for resolution. 
Suddenly, a whole world of intra-
cellular interactions was visible.

Despite the novelty and power 

of this approach, Betzig described 
becoming quickly tired of PALM.

“And so, again, I worked on 

PALM until 2008 and by that 
time I was sick of it for two rea-
sons. One is that super-resolution 
became a big bandwagon with 
lots of people getting into it. And 
usually when that happens I want 
to run as far as possible in another 
direction. The other thing is that, 
like my earlier super-resolution 
methods, it has a lot of really 
intrinsic limitations,” Betzig said.

The 
limitations 
mainly 

revolved around the fact that 
PALM is optimized for cells on 
a slide and isn’t adept at taking 
three-dimensional videos.

“Basically, I got sick of looking 

at dead things,” Betzig said.

In 2008, he was inspired by 

his colleague Mats Gustafsson, 
who developed structured illu-
mination microscopy, or SIM. 
This technique also beat the theo-
retical resolution limitation, but 
only by an order of two instead 
of the almost unlimited resolu-
tion achieved by PALM. For this 
reason, Gustafsson was not also 
considered for the Nobel Prize, a 
fact that Betzig takes issue with.

“Now, that was the reason 

the Nobel Committee stated — 
because it was only a factor of two 
instead of theoretically unlimited 
by … PALM — as to why SIM was 
not part of the Nobel Prize. But, 
in my opinion, that’s a tremen-
dous mistake. Honestly, I feel 
that SIM is the technique that 
has answered and will continue 
to answer many biological ques-
tions,” Betzig said.

Despite the quickly evolving 

nature of his field, he says that 
the important reminder is to use 
these technologies for practical 
purposes.

“Winning a Nobel Prize is fine. 

Publishing a bunch of cute papers 
is fine. But it all means diddly-
squat if these tools don’t answer 
biological questions. And I’m 
really concerned about that. And 
it’s very important to me to make 
sure that these tools get into the 
hands of biologists.”

Betzig said many challenges 

remain. Preparing samples prop-
erly is more difficult than ever, 
and the huge amount of data com-
ing out of the microscopes can be 
overwhelming.

“The problem with this micro-

scope is each biologist comes for 
a week and leaves with 10 tera-
bytes of data. And they have no 
fucking clue how to deal with it. 
You’ll never hear from them again 
because they’re too embarrassed 
to ask what to do,” he said.

Betzig hopes, however, that as 

technologies and information sci-
ences advance, soon his main goal 
will be achieved.

“Putting these pieces together 

will get us closer than ever before 
to studying cell physiology as it 
actually happens.”

internal survey released to rough-
ly 3,000 randomly selected stu-
dents on campus, and one survey 
released through the American 
Association of University to all 
students on 28 college campuses.

The results of each survey 

revealed both fairly high rates of 
sexual assault and high rates of 
disillusionment with the efficacy 
of the adjudication process. The 
University’s internal survey also 
revealed that certain groups are 
at higher risk for sexual assault; 
for example, students in Greek 
life are 2.5 times more likely to 
experience sexual assault than 
students not in Greek life.

With these numbers in hand, 

the University is developing a 
number of programs to target 
at-risk groups and expand their 
prevention programming for the 
entire student body.

The context: In his first year, 

Schlissel and the University’s 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center worked to 
raise awareness of sexual assault 
through the “I Will” campaign 
and through both surveys, seek-
ing data on campus climate sur-
rounding sexual misconduct.

In October 2014, students 

took it upon themselves to bring 
the issue to his attention. Stu-
dents held a protest on campus, 
before issuing seven demands 
for the administration related to 
addressing sexual misconduct. 

“This protest seeks to actively 

disrupt the University of Michi-
gan’s complacency in handling 
issues of sexual assault on this 
campus,” an anonymous group 
of survivors and allies stated in a 
viewpoint for the Daily. “To the 
administration: Students are tak-
ing action because it is time our 
voices are heard.”

However, Schlissel said he was 

frustrated by the way the stu-
dents framed the conversation.

“The one thing I will object 

to, which drives me a little nutty, 
is framing things as demands,” 
Schlissel told the Daily. “I think 
that makes it really difficult to 
have discussions.”

At the time, Schlissel said he 

was concerned that many of the 
demands made by the student 
protesters were actually cov-
ered by policies and procedures 
already in place, illustrating a 
lack of awareness among the stu-
dent body at large.

***

The University administration 

plays a large role in promoting 
sexual assault prevention — pro-
viding resources during New Stu-
dent Orientation and in residence 
halls such as Relationship Remix, 
Change it Up! and an orientation 
skit performed by the Education-
al Theatre Company. However, 
there’s some disagreement about 
the extent to which these pro-
grams are successfully contrib-
uting shifting the culture around 
sexual assault on campus.

Change it Up!, a bystander 

intervention program mandatory 
for freshmen during their first 
months at school, has recently 
expanded to cater to students 
of all years at the University. 
The program, which underwent 
its pilot year during Schlissel’s 
first year, prominently features 
sketches from the ETC to illus-
trate 
methods 
for 
bystander 

intervention.

ETC Director Callie McKee 

says the theater company part-
ners with Change it Up! to teach 
students 
the 
importance 
of 

bystander 
intervention 
when 

dealing with difficult situations, 
as well as dispel misinformation 
on sexual assault.

“With this sketch, we seek 

to send a message that sexual 
assault is a community issue — 
that it is everyone’s responsibility 
to make sure everyone can feel 
safe and respected,” McKee said.

According to research con-

ducted at the University of New 
Hampshire, one of the schools 
tapped by Vice President Joe 
Biden to aid the White House 
Task Force to Protect Students 
from Sexual Assault, freshmen 
learn University policies and prac-
tices best when given activities to 
review and think critically about 
the material they learn.

“It may not be enough to read 

students the campus policies in a 
class OR ask them to watch a video 
on their own time,” the report con-
cluded. “Rather, there may need to 
be an activity following the reading 
so that students can have help pro-
cessing the information in a way 
that will give them more in-depth 

understanding of the policy.”

However, McKee says the play, 

which is developed in part through 
the input of students, is meant to 
teach students about a variety of 
topics, such as mental health, alco-
hol and community living.

Pre- and post-survey data from 

the first iteration of Change it Up! 
show that the program has had an 
overall positive effect on its stu-
dents.

While 15.76 percent of students 

said they “strongly agreed” it was 
their business to intervene in 
harmful situations before the pro-
gram, 24.18 percent said they felt 
that way afterward. Overall, the 
total percentage of students who 
answered with “agree” or “strong-
ly agree” when asked if it was their 
business to intervene was 93.89 
percent by the workshop’s end.

Similarly, while 14.72 percent 

of students said they “strongly 
agreed” that they have confidence 
in their ability to intervene in 
harmful situations before complet-
ing the program, 24.49 percent said 
they felt that way afterward. Over-
all, the total percentage of students 
who felt confident enough in their 
intervention abilities to answer 
with “agree” or above was 93.41 
percent by the workshop’s end.

Business 
sophomore 
Maria 

Malinowski, who saw the ETC 
show last fall, pointed to Relation-
ship Remix as a better educational 
means of preventing sexual assault 
though she said she already knew 
much of the information provided.

“In the Relationship Remix pre-

sentation, we spent a significant 
amount of time learning about how 
to properly put on a condom,” she 
said. “While I think it’s important 
information, I feel that many stu-
dents have already had this lesson 
in high school health classes and 
don’t need to spend 15 minutes 
reviewing how to do so.”

LSA sophomore Rohin Patel 

said he also learned more from 
residence hall workshops like Rela-
tionship Remix and Change it Up! 
due to the ability to discuss the top-
ics in detail with small groups.

“I learned a good amount about 

sexual assault freshman year, but 
I feel that it wasn’t enough,” Patel 
said. “During orientation there 
are a lot of things students need to 
worry about, so oftentimes people 
can overlook this very important 
topic.”

***

Another educational method 

the University uses to educate stu-
dents is AlcoholEdu, an online quiz 
on alcohol abuse. Before arriving to 
campus, students are asked to take 
an online alcohol training program 
that indirectly addresses sexual 
assault prevention. According to 
Rider-Milkovich, this program has 
a 99-percent participation rate.

However, some students still 

were not aware of the campus 
resources for survivors of sexu-
al assault. Malinowski said she 
recalled the alcohol awareness 
quiz touching on sexual assault, 
though she did not learn about 
SAPAC or the University’s sexual 
assault policy.

“If those modules we had to 

complete mentioned SAPAC or 
other resources, I don’t remember 
them having a strong emphasis on 
them,” she said.

LSA sophomore Megan Mack-

enzie also said she was not aware of 
any University resources for sexual 
assault prevention before coming 
to campus, only Blue Light Emer-
gency Phones around campus. 
During her freshman year, she said, 
she learned the most from the ETC 
play in regard to sexual assault pre-
vention, but found Change it Up! 
“unnecessary.”

“At the time, I was 18 years old 

and I felt that if we had to be rein-
forced this common knowledge at 
the University level, then some-
thing was very wrong,” Mackenzie 
said.

As far as learning about the 

SAPAC policy on sexual assault, 
Patel and Malinowski both said 
they learned about it through 
non-administrative ways — Patel 
through running for CSG repre-
sentative position and Malinowski 
through a women’s studies class. 
Malinowski said SAPAC repre-
sentatives came to talk to her class 
about resources and the impor-
tance of consent, and said she 
wishes she received a similar pre-
sentation during orientation.

“Although we talked about 

SAPAC in our dorm presentation, 
people do skip those and would 
miss this information,” she said. “I 
feel like if the University stressed 
this issue more during orientation, 
where people generally don’t skip 
events they’re supposed to attend 
or are significantly less likely 
to skip, more students would be 
aware of these resources.”

***

To gather data on the subject, 

Schlissel issued a survey last win-
ter to gauge campus climate in 
the beginning his second semes-
ter as University president.

“Learning about the experi-

ences of students and the degree 
to which students feel safe and 
respected will help us better 
understand how we can more 
effectively address and prevent 
sexual 
misconduct,” 
Schlissel 

wrote in a January 2015 e-mail 
sent to the student body to intro-
duce the survey.

Schlissel said a campus-specif-

ic survey would give the Univer-
sity better data to use in creating 
programs and interventions to 
reduce sexual violence on cam-
pus.

“Learning about the experi-

ences of students and the degree 
to which students feel safe and 
respected will help us better 
understand how we can more 
effectively address and prevent 
sexual 
misconduct,” 
Schlissel 

wrote in the e-mail.

Schlissel said in a September 

interview with the Daily that the 
survey results, released in June, 
were disheartening. The results 
showed 11 percent of students 
reported experiencing some form 
of unwanted sexual behavior in 
the past year, and 12 percent of 
undergraduate females reported 
experiencing nonconsensual sex-
ual penetration — yet 89 percent 
of all students reported feeling 
relatively safe from sexual mis-
conduct on campus.

“Anything that involves 20 or 30 

percent of a population, that’s not 
a rare event — this is everyday life, 
this is culture,” Schlissel told the 
Daily.

Furthermore, the survey found 

though nearly 86 percent of all stu-
dents know the University has a 
Student Sexual Misconduct Policy, 
only 55 percent of students report-
ed receiving training or attending 
programs on sexual assault preven-
tion and reporting.

A separate survey in which the 

University participated, adminis-
tered by the Association of Ameri-
can Universities in March, showed 
of University students who said 
they experienced nonconsensual 
penetration 
involving 
physical 

force, 76.8 percent did not report 
the crime. Many who did not 
report said they did so because they 
did not consider it serious enough 
or because they thought nothing 
would be done about it.

Schlissel and other administra-

tors have stressed their continued 
dedication to preventing sexual 
misconduct on campus, but they 
have acknowledged that some stu-
dents may be unaware or feel skep-
tical of these efforts.

“We take every report of poten-

tial assault or misconduct of any 
kind very seriously,” Schlissel said. 
“So the obvious problem is that we 
are not getting that message across 
in a way that the students either 
hear or believe.”

Moving forward: So far, Schlis-

sel has emphasized data collection 
as a means for approaching sexual 
assault at the University. And with 
the survey results in, it appears 
that the University has room to 
improve.

In an interview with the Daily 

following the AAU survey results’ 
release, 
Rider-Milkovich 
said 

teachings from programs like Rela-
tionship Remix seem to “wear off 
over time.” Subsequently, the Uni-
versity is working to make assault 
prevention a more continuous and 
visible topic of discussion on cam-
pus.

For example, SAPAC has been 

working with Recreational Sports 
to create a poster campaign to 
appear in facilities across campus. 

“We want to be reinforcing that 

healthy relationships are a part 
of an overall wellness,” Rider-
Milkovich said. “So those kinds 
of messaging, specific to the ways 
that students engage in sports on 
our campus ... is an example of 
those targeted kinds of education 
efforts that need to complement 
the big-scale work that we’re doing. 
And all of that has to happen on 
many different levels.”

In an e-mail to the student body 

Thursday, E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life, invit-
ed students to provide feedback 
regarding the University’s sexual 
misconduct policy through a vari-
ety of student-led focus groups.

Overall, administrators have 

made it clear that sexual assault is 
not an issue unique to the Universi-
ty — and struggling to find success-
ful ways to mitigate the problem is 
not an challenge unique to the Uni-
versity either.

subject is being discussed in class.

LSA senior Chris James, BSU 

executive board member, said 
there should be no definition or 
stereotype of what it means to be 
Black at the University.

“There is no fit definition of 

what Black is,” he said. “When 
you go into the real world, the 
first thing people are going to see 
is that you’re Black. They’re not 
going to see what comes along 
with that. Being Black can encom-
pass so many other cultures and 
heritages and identities.”

LSA 
junior 
Travis 
Jones 

III recounted the shootings of 
unarmed Black men by police 
officers in Staten Island, N.Y., and 
Ferguson, Mo. last year. After 
those incidents, he said, Black 
men were often painted as thugs.

“That is a major stereotype in 

which people who are not in (the) 
culture have now used to describe 
us,” he said. “It’s really important 
that we understand these stereo-
types because they’re using them 
against us and we don’t do any-
thing about it. We all need to take 
action.”

A portion of the discussion was 

also dedicated to thinking about 
how diverse sexualities fit within 
the Black community.

BSU Speaker Capri’Nara Ken-

dall, a Kinesiology senior, said 
she believes the Black community 
is generally not accepting of the 
LGBTQ community.

“I feel sometimes people that 

identify as LGBTQ are often 
outcasted in the Black com-
munity,” she said. “I feel like 
heterosexual Black men tend 
to shy away from gay Black 
men because they don’t want 
to be associated with it. We as 
a community need to be more 
embracive of it so people that 
are afraid to come out feel com-
fortable and know that even 
though they are different, they 
will be accepted, because we 
all have differences that set us 
apart.”

LSA senior Lawrielle West said 

it’s important to remember that 
attacks against the Black LGBTQ 
community can also come in the 
form of microaggressions.

“Discrimination 
and 
mak-

ing people uncomfortable isn’t 
always blatant,” she said. “We just 
have to be careful in our language 
and be aware that not everyone in 
our community will have hetero-
normative identities.”

Trey Boynton, director of the 

Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs, said learning to listen to 
the LGBTQ community is vital in 
building connections with them.

“What it would be like if we 

said, ‘Trans community, come 

on. Let’s do this together, let’s 
talk about gayness and gay mar-
riage’?” she asked. “This inter-
sectionality conversation is so 
important because it’s all con-
nected, the hate, the laws, the 
systems. If we approach this issue 
from that way, we can all con-
nect.”

LSA senior Cooper Charlton, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

president, was also present at 
the discussion Thursday. In an 
interview with the Daily after the 
forum, Charlton said the event 
was helpful in forming individual 
connections.

“I think that last year, the Cen-

tral Student Government didn’t 
do the best job of reaching out,” 
Charlton said. “It’s all about con-
nections. I think the connec-
tions and getting to know people 
through personal relationships 
really comes down to personal 
interaction. I don’t think it’s fair 
for me to sit in chambers and 
make these constrictions of what 
the campus needs. I want to do 
that with others.”

In an interview after the 

forum, McKinney said she hopes 
students will now take more own-
ership over their own identities.

“I hope that students take 

away that can be who they are,” 
she said. “We fill in what we 
want to be and we can defy ste-
reotypes, we decide our presents 
and our futures.”

Treat all situations with sensitivity

Rethinking Detroit

“A

ww, I’m so sorry.”

I’ve heard this said 

to me a few times 

recently. 
Don’t 

worry: I haven’t 
lost any child-
hood 
pets, 
I 

haven’t endured 
a messy break 
up 

and I’m not the 
latest victim of a 
burglary.

But 
I 
am 
 

Syrian.

And 
to 
my 

unpleasant 
surprise, 
this 

is often the exact response I get 
when I tell people. Don’t mistake 
my reaction for being unapprecia-
tive. I’m thankful for every ounce 
of sympathy that comes my way, 
from friends and strangers alike. I 
understand the underlying senti-
ment; it might come off as cold, if 
not inconsiderate, to ignore the fact 
that my status as a Syrian American 
means things have been tough for 
me recently (to say the least).

But there’s something so heart-

breaking, so unsettlingly bizarre, 
about 
evoking 
sympathy 
from 

something that is an integral part 
of your identity. Substitute “Syr-
ian” for any other adjective and the 
absurdity becomes clear. Imagine if 
the next time you introduced your-
self as a Wolverine, you heard, “My 
thoughts and prayers are with you.”

Perhaps sympathy is something 

best expressed more subtly.

This small observation is part of 

a bigger theme: people often have 
the right intentions, but go about 
things in the wrong way. To me, 
the most significant example of this 
comes up after the introductions 
end and the conversation begins. 
There’s a tendency, especially in 
such a politically 
 conscious campus 

as ours, to engage in political 
discussion with people who are 
directly affected by current events. 
After all, they’re nothing short of 

primary sources. But all too often, 
these discussions are prompted and 
guided by ideas that oversimplify 
an incredibly complicated situation.

The 
government 
you 
keep 

referring to as bloodthirsty and 
fascistic may be the only thing 
separating a family from living in 
a hellish Islamic dystopia. On the 
other hand, that terrorist group 
you’re reproaching may be another 
family’s last semblance of law 
and order in the face of complete 
anarchy. These nuances do not 
make for good headlines, but they 
are the harsh realities for many 
people who are personally affected 
by this conflict.

Author and physician Michael 

Crichton 
has 
coined 
the 
term 

“Gell 
 Mann Amnesia” to describe 

something he believes is pervasive in 
our society. Simply put, we’re hyper 
aware of factual errors when a news 
source reports on something we 
know very well. But when the next, 
perhaps 
more 

obscure 
news 

story 
comes 

on, we tend to 
submit fully to 
its 
narrative, 

seeming to forget 
that these now-
obscure 
stories 

could eventually 
become 
ones 

we’ll be able to 
fact-check later. 
I believe this phenomenon applies 
to oversimplifications as well. When 
the news reports on systemic racism 
in police departments, we know the 
reality is much more complicated 
than “all cops are racist.” Yet, when 
the same news outlet reports on 
foreign conflicts, we see only as far as 
the headlines let us.

I’ve been guilty of this myself. 

A couple of years ago, a Ukrainian 
family moved into our neighbor-
hood. Whenever they were outside, 
I’d take the opportunity to chat 
them up, both in the interest of 

being a good neighbor and because 
I wanted to hear about the conflict 
right from the source. Since I knew 
they were from the eastern part of 
Ukraine, I tailored my remarks to 
be pro-Russian and peppered them 
with a hint of Euroscepticism.

Statistically, this was probably the 

right move. But that’s the point: Sta-
tistics are numbers, and people are 
people. Every individual has a unique 
experience — an experience that is 
undermined every time we cloud the 
conversation with generalities. Inter-
net comments give enough room to 
flex our knowledge of global affairs. 
If our goal is to learn, we should 
make listening our priority.

That being said, engaging in 

a political conversation requires 
more than listening. And there are 
certainly political truths that indi-
vidual circumstances cannot speak 
to. So, what’s really needed here is 
some respect and patience. Avoid 
making claims about anything you 

haven’t 
spent 

a good deal of 
time 
research-

ing. 
If 
some-

one’s experience 
doesn’t 
match 

the 
politi-

cal 
narrative 

you’ve 
heard, 

try to learn from 
them 
rather 

than speak over 
them. Don’t cat-

egorize anyone as “pro 
” or “anti 
”; to 

do so would betray the complexities 
of the situation. Be prepared to hear 
a lot less about politics and a lot 
more about people — aunts, uncles 
and cousins, rather than stats and 
figures. Because at the end of the 
day, that’s what matters the most.

A news story to you can be a life 

event for someone else. Remember 
to treat these situations with all the 
sensitivities they afford.

A

t 
the 
Detroit 
Department 
of 

Transportation 
headquarters 
on 

September 17, U.S. Vice President Joe 

Biden and Detroit Mayor 
Mike Duggan announced 
the implementation of an 
improved bus system in 
Detroit. Instead of the bus 
sign behind them blinking 
a destination, as is usual 
with buses, it flashed, one 
by one, “Welcome — Joe 
Biden — Detroit.” 

Though the initiative to 

bring new buses to Detroit 
may not be flashy, it has the 
real needs of Detroiters in 
mind to help them in their 
day-to-day lives and to bring them into a more 
stable standard of living. In the past, people 
have had to stand in the frigid Michigan cold 
for long hours in the winter waiting for buses 
that may have already 
been full. It impacts the 
lives of so many Detroiters 
who, 
with 
this 
new 

system, can get to work 
or school on time, safely 
 

and effectively.

Biden 
has 
been 
a 

supporter of Detroit in 
the past. He, alongside 
the rest of the Obama 
administration, invested 
$40 
million 
from 

the Institute for Advanced Composites 
Manufacturing Innovation funds to create a 
research and development project in Detroit’s 
Corktown neighborhood. 

As Biden spoke of how “Detroit is off its 

back, off its knees, standing up again,” I felt 
a hope welling up inside that there’s potential 
for real change, but I also began to feel 
uneasy. His words echoed in my head: “We 
would never abandon the people of Detroit. 
It’s like abandoning the heart of America.”

Though I believe in this effort and the 

work that Biden has done for Detroit in the 
past, I couldn’t stomach the idea that Detroit 
has never been neglected, to say the least.

This isn’t to say progress in Detroit is 

not being made, but there are substantial 
problems in the city that have been 
overlooked. Every minute we avoid talking 
about the big picture and the complexities of 
the problems in Detroit is another person’s 
life negatively affected. So, instead, let’s talk 
about the good and the bad in Detroit, so that 
we are able to move forward together.

Let’s start a real conversation about 

Detroit.

At DDOT, as Biden talked about bringing 

in the brightest young people to Detroit, 
I couldn’t stop thinking about the young 
minds growing up in the city. Children in 
Detroit are suspended in an education system 
where teachers and faculty do most of the 
groundwork to improve their schools.

I spent some time volunteering at Detroit 

Achievement Academy, a charter school in 
Detroit for children in kindergarten to third 

grade, where the teachers truly care about 
their students and spend time encouraging 
them. While volunteering, I watched the 
children become excited to learn and to spend 
time with the volunteers. However, a looming 
reality hangs over them, as premature birth 
and violence are the top reasons for the death 
of children in Detroit in January 2014. Almost 
500 children have been killed by homicide 
since 2010, and Detroit has had a higher 
homicide rate for children and adolescents 
than any U.S. city of equivalent or larger size. 
These are Detroit’s bright minds that need to 
be nurtured and kept in a safe environment, 
yet they’re often not.

Though some people may want to make 

progress in the city, others are discouraged by 
high property taxes that cripple entrepreneurs 
while making it difficult for people to get 
out of homelessness, as suggested by the 
Detroit News in 2013. It also creates an extra 
burden on those that already reside in Detroit 

homes, and though the 
city may be in need of 
this money, high property 
taxes may not be the best 
alternative, as they push 
people away, hurting the 
 

Detroit economy.

While listening to Biden 

speak about Detroit and its 
transportation system, my 
heart hurt the most when 
I thought about the recent 
Detroit 
water 
shutoff, 

which went without enough attention from 
the public, media or politicians. The city’s 
leaders gave out 3,000 notices to people that 
their water would be shut off if they didn’t pay 
their bill in 10 days. Furthermore, Duggan 
went against the Detroit City Council’s 
resolution to temporarily freeze the shutoff. 
Although delinquent water bills were a large 
problem that cost the city money, it ignored 
the public health issues this created for 
people who legitimately couldn’t afford to pay 
their water bills. This financial situation and 
health crisis shouldn’t have become so severe, 
with the United Nations speaking about the 
shutoff as a human rights violation before our 
nation’s federal government. But it did.

I couldn’t fathom that something right in 

my backyard would be so terrible, but the 
situation is just a symptom of the attitudes 
and neglect Detroit has been through.

Trying to instill hope in the people of 

Detroit, reminding them they’re not being 
abandoned and that Detroit is back is a 
valiant effort. A lot of progress is being made 
with this new bus system; it brings the people 
of Detroit something they need that is long 
overdue. But there’s still a lot of work to be 
done in order to bring Detroit back on its feet.

My hope is that this really is a step to 

rethinking Detroit in terms of the most basic 
and urgent needs of the people.

As Biden said “This isn’t an investment 

in buses, this is an investment in the people 
 

of Detroit.”

— U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday evening in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White 

House after a mass shooting that left 10 dead at a small community college in Oregon. 
“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

I hope and pray that I don’t have to 
come out again during my tenure as 
president to offer my condolences to 
families in similar circumstances.”

Often, we naturally look inward 

to our own problems and con-
flicts, forgetting that out in this 
vast world there are inconceivable 
challenges our fellow humans are 
facing. By virtue of being flanked 
by two oceans, many Americans 
tend not to focus on foreign issues. 
However, from time to time, a crisis 
of extreme enormity requires our 
attention and requires our action. 
As the self-proclaimed greatest 
nation on Earth, it is our duty as a 
virtuous citizenry to play a key role 
in these conflicts.

The greatest migration since 

World War II is happening cur-
rently, and several Western gov-
ernments seem simply not to care 
about the lives of millions. Already, 
nations such as Hungary, Slove-
nia and Croatia have shut their 
borders to asylum seekers, Den-
mark has taken out newspaper 
advertisements in Lebanon to dis-
courage potential refugees from 
seeking hope there, a Hungarian 
news camerawoman was caught 
tripping refugees as they sprinted 
from a camp, and a Polish par-
liamentarian is facing criticism 
after openly describing migrants 
as “human garbage” on the floor 
of the European Parliament. In a 
classic case of xenophobia, entire 
nations and many observers would 
rather see their land and culture 
stay untouched by a new influx of 
humanity, for fears of burdening 
social systems and encroaching 
on established cultures. Unfor-
tunately, this view is ignorant to 
the facts of immigration. Multiple 

studies cited by The Washington 
Post have shown that immigration, 
more often than not, improves the 
economy. Though the initial cost of 
accepting refugees may be steep, in 
the long run, according to research, 
migrants tend to lift wages for the 
entire community and can have 
lasting positive effects on local 
economies. Moreover, in several 
European nations, the birth rate is 
not on par with what’s necessary 
for the population to remain steady. 
These nations may not realize it, 
but they may actually need new 
citizens, increasingly so in the next 
few decades.

Beyond the logic that underpins 

the benefits of the act, accepting 
refugees is simply the right thing 
to do. Fear mongering related to 
immigrants has always existed, 
and there are those who would say 
these refugees pose a threat to our 
way of life, our institutions and 
even our national security. These 
opinions will always exist, and even 
if they are correct in the smallest of 
cases, there are systems such as the 
Department of Homeland Security, 
Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment and the entire federal bureau-
cracy in place for a vetting process 
of new migrants.

Those 
scenarios 
notwith-

standing, it’s our duty as a part of 
humanity to do more to alleviate 
this situation. Think what a great 
accomplishment it would be for 
this nation to lead in this crisis, but 
more importantly, think about how 
much good we can do for this world 
if we help save the lives of millions.

As I write this today, there are 

hundreds of thousands of men, 
women and children risking their 
lives to find hope anywhere pos-
sible. Sympathy and compassion 
can only go so far; the only way to 
positively affect this crisis would be 
to take action.

That isn’t to say the United States 

should do all the work and take in 
an unrealistic amount of refugees 
or foot the entire bill for aid pack-
ages, but it does mean that as the 
leaders of the “free world,” we need 
to be at the forefront of a multilat-
eral mission to both take in more 
refugees and help improve the situ-
ation for those who are making the 
journey as well as the vast amounts 
of individuals and families who feel 
migration is the only option left.

This issue shouldn’t be politi-

cized; it isn’t a matter of left or 
right, Republican or Democrat. It 
boils down to the challenge of liv-
ing up to the creeds and values that 
guide this world of ours. As the 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights — a document the United 
States voted in favor of — states in 
its preamble, “Whereas recogni-
tion … of the equal and inalienable 
rights of all members of the human 
family is the foundation of freedom, 
justice and peace in the world.”

It’s our responsibility to at least 

try and help these migrants achieve 
the same freedoms and happiness 
as we enjoy, for they’re in dire need 
of a helping hand.

A crisis for the whole world

 I felt a hope welling 
up inside that there’s 

potential for real 
change, but I also 

began to feel uneasy.

Engaging in 
a political 

conversation 

requires more than 

just listening.

‘MSGV’: Old Dogs 
learn new tricks

New open-world 

series entry is clever 

and innovative

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

Since the dawn of cinema, art 

critics have been arguing about 
the concept of specificity as it 
relates to a medi-
um. If a film has 
cinematographic 
specificity (artis-
tic qualities that 
are unique to cin-
ema), does it have 
inherently more 
value than a film 
that doesn’t?

Now, 
critics 

have begun to 
carry this argu-
ment over to the 
interactive medi-
um. Is a game 
with more player 
agency 
more 

worthwhile, because it excels in 
ways only video games can?

This critical dilemma is the 

heart of the discussion surround-
ing the “Metal Gear Solid” series. 
The popular stealth action fran-
chise’s first four numbered games, 
while all critically acclaimed, 
have received flak from fans and 
critics regarding their cinematic 
influences. Some have argued the 
series relies too much on cutscenes 
and linear narrative. Others have 
argued that “Metal Gear” ’s cin-
ematic influences are extraordi-
narily compelling, and are part of 
what makes the series great.

That’s why it’s so fascinating 

that “Metal Gear Solid V,” the fifth 
numbered entry in this wildly 
popular series, completely aban-
dons the focused narrative struc-
ture of the previous major games. 
Instead, it relies almost entirely on 
open-ended, emergent gameplay, 
favoring a high degree of player 
agency in problem solving over 
scripted sequences. 

The vast majority of “MGSV” 

is a military open-world game 
that takes place in two humon-
gous areas based on real-world 
locations: Afghanistan and the 
Angola-Zaire border region of 
Africa. As a member of military 
NGO “Diamond Dogs,” the player 
is tasked with completing military 
objectives. But, rather than cram-
ming its open world full of side 
activities and collectibles as many 
of its contemporaries like “Assas-
sin’s Creed,” “Grand Theft Auto” 
and “Mad Max” do, the world of 
“MGSV” is mostly empty wilder-
ness, save for numerous guarded 
outposts. 

This lack of extraneous content 

is undoubtedly a positive thing. 
With few distractions, Kojima and 
Konami were able to hone “Metal 
Gear” ’s core gameplay — infiltrat-
ing and exfiltrating guarded areas 
— into the finest stealth action 
gameplay the genre has ever seen. 
This is due to the incredible degree 
of control the player has over his 
or her avatar, the sheer number of 
tactical options the player can use 
in combat, and the flexibility of the 
AI in how it reacts to the player. 

 So, whether you’re focusing 

on efficiently completing a mis-

sion or just dicking around in the 
open world, the joy of “MGSV” 
is discovering the clever, brutal 
and often hilarious ways you can 
interact with enemy soldiers. The 
exhilaration of trying something 
new and having it succeed or fail 
gloriously is the joy of “MGSV.” 
The mission structures are gen-
erally quite engaging and often 
act as a creative spark for encour-
aging experimentation with the 
mechanics. 

Further expanding upon the 

already excellent gameplay is 
the “buddy” system, an entirely 
unique ally mechanic that adds 
yet another layer of options for in/
exfiltration. At any time, the player 
can call upon an eclectic mix of 
helpers — a horse, a dog, a sniper 
and a robot — all with interesting, 
powerful and upgradable abilities. 
The buddies each add a new angle 
of strategy to gameplay, and their 
most interesting uses are so fun to 
discover and play around with that 
they should not be spoiled here. 

When “MGSV” ’s full toy chest 

of weapons, buddies, vehicles and 
abilities are unlocked, there is no 
doubt that it becomes the greatest 
open-world sandbox game ever 
made. 

However, the road to this 

heightened state of emergent 
gameplay is a rocky and somewhat 
unsavory one. “MGSV” employs 
a progression and unlock system 
straight from “Metal Gear Solid: 
Peace Walker,” a game for the 
PSP that, by most accounts, very 
few people played. To unlock new 
weapons and items, the player 
must navigate a complex system 
of recruitment, staff management 
and research & development, none 
of which is particularly compel-
ling, and all of which requires 
grinding. It’s the kind of mediocre 
menu-based gameplay one would 
find in a mobile companion app for 
a game, more “addicting” than fun. 

The most bizarre facets of this 

system are the completely pointless 
countdown timers that make the 
player wait unreasonable amounts 
of time after unlocking weapons to 
be able to use them. These feel like 
remnants of a scummy microtrans-
action system that was scrapped 
late in development. 

While the narrative of “MGSV” 

is far, far less central than in the 
other games, it still maintains 
something of a presence. The nar-
rative in this game is kind of like 
Ethan Hawke’s divorced dad char-

acter in “Boyhood.” He shows up 
once in a while with a few cheap 
presents under his arm, and it’s 
usually pretty fun and interesting 
when he does, but you never know 
when he’s going to ring your door-
bell. Him, and it, have consistency 
issues. 

It’s worth noting that the 

cutscenes in this game are shame-
lessly catered to the heterosexual 
male gaze. The way the camera 
zooms in and lingers on female 
body parts will elicit at best eye-
rolls and at worst legitimate dis-
gust from many players. It’s a huge 
bummer the direction isn’t more 
inclusive.

But hey, at least its chauvin-

ism runs at a great framerate. On 
PS4, this game runs at a rock-solid 
1080p 60FPS, a visual standard 
that few games on the console have 
met, but more should. 

The voice acting in this game 

is 
strange. 
Kiefer 
Sutherland 

(Fox’s “24”) is excellent as pro-
tagonist Snake, but the character 
is mostly silent throughout the 
game. There are several scenes 
that almost require Snake to talk, 
but he stands there, mute. Snake’s 
comrades do the vast majority of 
the talking, suggesting that there 
may have been contract or budget 
issues with Sutherland picking up 
the part.

One more nitpick: the back third 

of the mission menu in this game 
is rife, confusingly, with optional 
“extreme” versions of earlier mis-
sions. While fun, these should have 
been confined to a separate menu. 

While “MGSV” has its share 

of problems, it’s still the boldest 
and most original game the open-
world genre has seen in many 
years. Swinging from one extreme 
end of the “linear vs. open-ended” 
spectrum to the other is no small 
task, and the late Kojima Produc-
tions pulled it off swimmingly. It 
will be fascinating to see whether 
this game attains “classic” status 
among fans as its PlayStation pre-
decessors have, because upsets in 
structure this huge rarely do well 
by internet fandoms. Until then, 
“MGSV” is a fascinating beast 
that demands to be experienced 
by the curious and worshipped by 
the established open-world gamer. 
Few games are as risky, beautiful 
and brilliant. Savor this one.

Daily Arts Writer

In light of the recent Jew-

ish holidays of Rosh Hashanah 
and Yom Kippur, I think it’s the 
right time to express my dis-
taste for Lil Dicky as a person of 
the Jewish faith. I do not con-
sider myself highly religious, 
but I am proud of my heritage 
and identity as a Jew. 

The history of the Jewish 

people has been one of eter-
nal struggle. Over thousands of 
years, the Jewish people have 
been enslaved and harshly dis-
criminated against and, between 
1939 and 1945, six million of my 
people were systematically mur-
dered in the Holocaust. Things 
have been rough.

I’ve been far luckier in my 

own life. I haven’t had to face 
the multitude or intensity of the 
struggles my ancestors have had 
to embrace in the quest for social 
and religious freedom. I grew 
up in an unusually Jewish area, 
where two massive temples are 
just a short drive from my house. 
And the University provides 
many resources for Jewish stu-
dents, such as Hillel, the Jewish 
American Resource Center and 
even a Chabad house just down 
the street from me. Despite these 
welcoming environments, I’ve 
still had to deal with negative 
Jewish stereotypes on countless 
occasions in my life. 

I have been aware of Lil 

Dicky’s music for some time 
now, and he has acquired broad 
mainstream attention with his 
debut album Professional Rapper. 
His recent music video for “$ave 
Dat Money” is getting plenty of 
coverage, too. I wouldn’t write 
this article had he not achieved 
some level of success — and to 
my great surprise. According 
to Billboard he had the number 
one Rap Album in America in 
early August around the album’s 
release on July 31. 

Lil Dicky is exploiting his 

Jewish 
heritage 
for 
satire. 

“$ave Dat Money” is a direct 
appeal to the stereotype of Jews 
being cheap and petty about 
money. I’ll give him some credit 
— it was a wise career decision 
to get Fetty Wap and Yo Gotti 
on the track. The concept of 
making a rap music video for as 
little as possible is comical, too, 
but the fact that this endeavor 
is qualified as a product of his 
Jewishness is what ticks me off. 
The soliloquy where he makes a 
fuss about being double charged 
for a refill of coffee is unimagi-
native and insulting. 

In “$ave Dat Money,” he 

drops the line “I’mma get on 
Yelp in a minute and review / 
This piece of shit place like only 
a Kike know how.” The reck-
lessness with which Lil Dicky 
plays up Jewish stereotypes 
isn’t a one time deal. In “All K” 
he proclaims “I’m a K-I-K-E.”

“It’s OK because he’s Jew-

ish,” fans (aptly known as 
“Dickheads”) might claim, or 
“It’s satire, you just don’t get it.”

I’m sure some readers think 

I’m making a big deal out of 
nothing, or am being too sen-
sitive, but whenever I hear Lil 
Dicky’s music I’m brought back 
to my own personal experi-
ences with Jewish stereotypes. 

I cringe at Lil Dicky’s music 
because of the connections 
between the stereotypes he 
laughs about and the prejudice 
I’ve experienced in my own life.

At one of my soccer buddies’ 

catechism 
celebrations 
back 

in the day, one of the family 
friends in attendance started 
ranting about Jews. The one 
particular topic I remember 
was how “Jews aren’t good at 
sports,” because they’re weak 
and unathletic. He continued 
on with other wild accusations 
of Jewish people and Israel that 
he sincerely believed. I would 
estimate this guy’s age at 55 
years — a full grown adult with 
plenty of grey hairs. I was 12 or 
13. I proudly identified myself 
as a Jew and defended myself, 
leaving shortly after in extreme 
discomfort. My friends’ parents 
simply brushed his remarks off 
as not a big deal. This would not 
be the last time I had such an 
experience.

While this event is particu-

larly salient in my mind as 
one of my earlier experiences 
with outright anti-Semitism, 
all throughout my life I have 
encountered 
people 
making 

remarks based on negative ste-
reotypes of Jews that aren’t 
necessarily rooted in an out-
right hatred like that guy. I can 
laugh at myself or jokes about 
someone’s overbearing Jewish 
grandmother and use of half-
assed Yiddish, but sometimes 
it’s different. 

Playing travel soccer in high 

school, I recall on a couple occa-
sions an opponent muttering 
about us being “spoiled Jewish 
kids.”

My first week at college, I met 

some kid on my hall. I intro-
duced myself and told him my 
hometown.

“Oh, so you’re a spoiled Jew.”
I 
nervously 
laughed, 
“I 

wouldn’t say ‘spoiled.’”

I didn’t appreciate his tone or 

diction. I would never see that 
kid again, anyway.

Other times in my life I have 

experienced even more moder-
ate occurrences in everyday life 
situations.

“You still owe me $10, I’d 

appreciate it if you paid me 
back.”

“You’re such a Jew, haha.”
I’m not one to always take 

such comments lightly, as much 
as others might not like to make 
a fuss. Sometimes I angrily 
respond to such comments, typ-
ically surprising or upsetting 

the person. They too are quick 
to excuse it and brush it aside.

“It’s not a big deal.” 
“It’s just a joke, relax.” 
Other times I’m simply too 

tired to say much more than a 
half-hearted “F*** you.” 

I’d like to reiterate the fact 

that I have always gone through 
life with a strong Jewish minor-
ity around me in my commu-
nities, or, very infrequently, a 
majority. I can imagine it would 
only be worse being one of three 
Jewish students at a school of 
2,000, like some of friends at 
my temple in high school, or liv-
ing in parts of the U.S. where 
people my age have never met a 
Jewish person prior to college. 

I think Lil Dicky’s self-depre-

cating shtick gets old, but that’s 
not what I’m here to discuss. I 
can appreciate his goofy antics 
to some extent, but not how Lil 
Dicky uses negative Jewish ste-
reotypes to carve out his come-
dic persona as a rapper.

And it isn’t a challenge for 

him to achieve this image. He 
has Sephardic physical attri-
butes that listeners likely asso-
ciate with Jewishness — curly 
black hair, a black beard, etc.

In relation to Lil Dicky feed-

ing off of stereotypes, there’s 
something to be said of Black 
rappers using the N-word and 
perpetuating negative stereo-
types, but I don’t believe it’s 
my place to say much because, 
as a white person, I don’t know 
what it’s like to experience that 
discrimination. I do know that 
in “All K” Lil Dicky claims that 
if Black people can “say the N 
word / I sure as fuck can say 
Kike / Do something about it, 
pussy.” I suppose socially speak-
ing this may be true, but that 
doesn’t mean you should. As 
Dave Chappelle reflected on 
his time with “The Chappelle 
Show,” his sketches were “funny, 
but socially irresponsible.”

Lil Dicky is purposefully uti-

lizing hyper-exaggerated Jew-
ish stereotypes as one of the 
primary pillars of his career. 
And there doesn’t appear to be 
a silver lining — he’s not using 
these 
stereotypes 
ironically 

to break them down. Listen-
ers might be laughing, but as 
Dave Chappelle realized before 
deciding to cancel “The Chap-
pelle Show,” there’s a certain 
way a group may be laughing at 
a joke that makes it not so funny 
or satirical. There’s a difference 
between people laughing with 
you and people laughing at you.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW

From the first look, we knew 

Miuccia Prada was mixing busi-
ness with pleasure for SS16. 
Though the death of her aunt pre-
vented her from seeing the show 
in its live grandeur, we can only 
imagine the insight behind her sar-
torial articulation of the modern 
woman. It’s clear she designed for 
a woman of conflict — potentially 
one for a socialite who’s facing an 
identity crisis — Well, yes, power 
lunch at 12:30, but what about the 
ladies, are we lunching? The for-
mer version of the modern woman 
could easily be seen donning any 
of the collection’s precisely tailed 
power suits, while her alter ego 
outshines the #squad in the wispy 
emerald number topped with 
the oversize statement trench.

Modernized pencil skirts of 

the transparent, patchwork and 
asymmetric 
varieties 
radiated 

cheekiness 
typically 
exclusive 

to the brand’s little sister line, 
Miu Miu. Still, pantsuits reigned, 
proving the label’s everlasting 
contingency to the intellectual 
vibe of Dr. Prada herself. Accents 
of otherworldly adornments like 
colossal ear baubles and slashes 
of gold lipstick contrasted any 
seriousness of structured silhou-
ettes. If this is the norm in cor-
porate Prada cubicles, I want in.

The 
collection’s 
whimsical 

overtones appeared throughout 
the show, ranging from trench-
es accented by vertical, gilded 
pinstripes and models donning 
multi-colored pumps to all those 

go-go’s. Accessories played a key 
role in the coquettish, yet bookish 
vibes, as the line traded in iconic 
Willy Wonka-esque sunglasses 
for pastel-rimmed spectacles. An 
overarching ’70s color palate of 
oranges, tan and muted greens 
and browns taught us that the 

era’s trends are now cemented. 
However, I’m still trying to figure 
out those fishnet necklaces, or are 
they meant to be scarves? Dickeys, 
perhaps? Alas, Miuccia continu-
ally throws us for a sartorial loop.

MILAN FASHION WEEK

Max Mara provided a fresh 

set of cool classics to lure in 
all ages. Creative Director Ian 
Griffiths settled on a nauti-
cal line for spring/summer, 
yet nothing feels boring or 
routine about this collection. 
The fabulous basics are there 
— stripes, sailor trousers, pea 
coats — fixed among a sea 
of edgy star knits, maritime 
prints on silk and modern jack-
ets. The pacing of the show 
was excellent — one moment 
red summer stripes and the 
next a tasseled skirt paired 
with a nude starry knit. The 
fact that the show could move 
effortlessly 
from 
a 
classic 

striped jacket and pant combo 
to summer whites onto an 

edgy black power outfit can be 
attributed to a perfected Max 
Mara trademark of simultane-
ous dependability and novelty.

Every 
look 
that 
came 

down the runway had amaz-
ing craftsmanship, luxurious 
fabrics and beautiful move-
ment. The classic cuts syn-
onymous 
with 
Max 
Mara 

paired perfectly with this 
season’s trends (primary col-
ors, stars and stripes). This 
look of striped yellow sail-
or pants and cropped star 
knit with edgy round shades 
and killer flats shows how 
in touch Griffiths is with 
the modern woman’s needs.

Y

ou might think that this 
column will be about 
What a Time To Be 

Alive, because FutureDrake/
LoveSounds is the collab of the 
century and 
that’s what I 
would write 
about if I 
took my job 
seriously. 
This column 
is not about 
What a Time 
to Be Alive, 
however, 
and that’s 
because it’s 
definitely a time to be alive, 
but so was last time and next 
time will probably be, too. I’m 
also not sure what strange 
astrological nonsense had to 
happen for me to get this job, 
so I’m still working out how 
to take it seriously. Right now 
that means drinking vending 
machine coffee and putting pic-
tures of bathroom graffiti on 
my Snapchat story at 4 a.m., but 
all things are possible through 
the Based God, who, as we all 
know, works in mysterious 
ways (#TYBG).

In any case, we are in fact 

alive and, as Riff Raff once 
said, “time (time) goes by (goes 
by), it goes on (it goes on), 
and it don’t stop (don’t stop).” 
Winter 
changes 
to 
spring, 

spring changes to summer, 
and summer changes to Slime 
Season, 
the 
latest 
mixtape 

from 
Atlanta 
rapper/weirdo 

Young Thug, wherein we finally 
discover what Thugger orders 
at Chipotle. It’s the gotdamn 
salad, naturally.

Slime Season isn’t all that 

interesting other than the salad 
thing, but you’ll recall from my 
last column that I’m somewhat 
preoccupied 
with 
salads 
— 

albeit of the Dadaist word and 
Caesar word varieties — so I 
suspect that Young Thug and I 
might actually be speaking the 
same blanguage. That’s a good 
thing, I think, because I’ve been 
hung up on what the fuck he’s 

talking about in his song “I Got 
(feat. Peewee Longway)” since 
last September, and I really 
miss being able to sleep at night.

I’ll give you the lyrics to 

Thugger’s hook, just so we can 
all be on the same page:

“I got, bitches in the dirt like 

a fucking termite / And this 
bitch must think I’m green, but 
ho, I’m red like a car light / And 
him against me, babe I’ma win 
like a pipe / Now give me eight 
million, I come to the rescue! / 
Yeah, I’ma protect your heart 
just like a vest do / Yeah, I’m a 
prince I don’t wake up like the 
rest do / I’ma ride on your ho 
like she a Mongoose.”

There are a few places we 

could start, but I think the best 
might be to get the obvious 
out of the way — this shit is 
bananas. 
Completely 
batshit 

brazy (or crazy, for those of 
my readers who aren’t well-
versed in blood talk). The rest 
of the track is equally insane, 
with 
Young 
Thug 
rapping 

about 
a 
potentially 
racist, 

mildly incestuous sex scene 
and forgetting the difference 
between his head and his penis 
before Peewee Longway shows 
up to spit a 24 bar paraphrase of 
everything else that happens in 
the song.

And yet, somehow all of that 

surrealist 
nonsense 
doesn’t 

really shock the conscience — 
it’s weird, but at the end of the 
day we’re left with a pretty 
standard trap song. Thugger 
spits his 24-bar verse, mentions 
the obligatory drug deals and 
luxury goods, and makes the 
traditional preposterous sexual 
boasts. In short, he follows all 
the rules.

Except 
there’s 
one 
spot 

where 
Young 
Thug 
does 

something truly obscene, and 
here he’s offending not only the 
trap gods, but also the entire 
western metaphysical tradition.

I’m talking, of course, about 

that “I’ma win like a pipe” line.

Now, before you give up on 

me and go see what my friends 
in the sports section have to 
say about sportball, take a 
moment to consider Slovenian 
Marxist 
philosopher/human 

sinus infection Slavoj Žižek’s 
ruminations on the Kinder 
Surprise Egg in “The Pervert’s 
Guide to Ideology” (if you 
haven’t seen the film, go ask the 
nearest white man with a beard 
to give you a brief synopsis). 
The 
Kinder 
Surprise 
Egg 

works in much the same way 
as a fortune cookie — you open 
up the egg/cookie, which has 
a milk chocolate/nondescript 
cookie shell, and inside you 

find a plastic toy/fortune. In 
a traditional reading of the 
Kinder 
egg/fortune 
cookie, 

Slavoj explains, the toy/fortune 
— a hidden, secret meaning or 
richness — is the reason why 
the entire apparatus exists. You 
tear away the cookie or the milk 
chocolate shell to get at your toy/
fortune, the true object of your 
desire. The same metaphysical 
logic applies to certain ways 
of 
conceptualizing 
human 

activity, 
like 
Christianity, 

neoliberal capitalism and most 
Pitchfork reviews.

As Slavoj goes on to argue, 

however, the traditional reading 
of the Kinder Egg problem isn’t 
necessarily the right one. You 
could, for example, treat the 
plastic toy/fortune — which is 
hard to assign a fixed identity 
to, particularly when you’re 
talking about the meaning of 
life instead of a bunch of lucky 
numbers — as the condition 
necessary to appreciate its 
chocolaty exoskeleton as the 
true object of our desire. This 
anti-metaphysical assertion is 
“hard to grasp,” as Slavoj puts 
it, and it’s somewhat unclear 
what’s at stake in thinking 
about life as an endless search 
for chocolaty exoskeletons. I 
don’t know about you, but it 
sounds kind of fetishistic.

Which brings us back to our 

friend Young Thug. What is Thug-
ger really saying when he raps 
“Bitch, I’mma win like a pipe”?

The answer, of course, is very 

simple: he’s gonna win. And 
yet that simple answer doesn’t 
quite explain what he said. He’s 
gonna win like a pipe. That “like 
a pipe” — a sort of dysfunctional 
simile that doesn’t actually 
explain how he’s going to win, 
but just makes a play on the 
word “windpipe,” which, of 
course, only works because 
Young Thug’s voice sounds like 
an autotuned crow — is the 
essence of Young Thugness.

Thugger is (and we are) pure 

finesse: the gloriously absurd 
excess that justifies spending 
our lives rooting around, not 
unlike the pigs and termites 
populating his lyrics, in the 
quotidian muck of existence. 
The true meaning of life, as 
Žižek and Young Thug show 
us, is to learn to love neither 
the salad nor the dressing, but 
to love the act of pouring on 
the sauce … which might also 
explain why that dude is always 
rapping about ejaculating. 

DePollo is watching sportball.

Michigan hosts Toronto in 
exhibition to open season

Preseason Big Ten 
No. 1 ranking puts 
high expectations 

on Wolverines

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

Sunday, the Yost Ice Arena 

doors will swing open for the first 
time this season.

After a summer of NHL 

development 
camps 
and 

internships, 
the 
Michigan 

hockey 
team 
hosts 

Toronto in an 
exhibition.

“It’s 
our 

first game, so I 
know we’ll be 
excited,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. 
“I hope we see 
the intensity of a real game. You 
play hockey all summer, and you 
get into summer habits. There’s 
no stopping and starting, no 
hitting, no break-out defense, 
so we want to start getting into 
some good habits.”

But a new season also brings 

high expectations.

The Big Ten coaches picked the 

Wolverines to win the conference 
in the league’s poll Monday. 
Junior forward JT Compher, 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 

Werenski and freshman forward 
Kyle Connor were also named to 
the Big Ten Preseason Players to 
Watch list.

Werenski, 
one 
of 
four 

unanimous 
selections 
to 

the list, leads 
a 
defensive 

unit 
that 

returns all of 
its significant 
contributors. 
Two 
freshmen, 
Joseph Cecconi and Nicholas 
Boka, will be adding to the talent 
on the blue line. Both come in as 
highly touted recruits and 2015 
NHL Draft picks.

“They’re 
younger, 
but 

they’re doing a good job taking 
everything 
in 
stride,” 
said 

sophomore defenseman Cutler 
Martin. “As soon as the games 
start to come, they’re going to 
learn a lot really fast, and they’re 
going to be an impact on our 
team.”

Connor, the reigning United 

States Hockey League Player 
of the Year, is among the most 
highly touted of those freshmen. 
Another summer NHL draft 

pick, he brings a wealth of talent 
to a team that lost its top three 
scorers from last season in Dylan 
Larkin, Andrew Copp and Zach 
Hyman.

On the other side of the ice, 

Toronto comes into the game 
after a mediocre 16-16 season. 
Led by coach Darren Lowe, the 
Varsity Blues travel across the 

border to face 
two 
NCAA 

teams 
in 

Bowling Green 
and Michigan, 
before heading 
back to Canada 
to start their 
season.

But 
in 

an exhibition, it won’t be the 
opponent that the Wolverines 
are worried about. It will be their 
own team.

“A lot of the older guys, we 

know our systems, but executing 
those to more of a tee is going to 
be important this year because 
obviously, we’ve come one goal 
short or one game short of the 
tournament 
the 
past 
couple 

years,” Martin said. “Making 
sure everything is spot on from 
the very beginning and working 
out those kinks against Toronto is 
going to be big because two weeks 
later when we play Mercyhurst, 
it’s going to be important that we 
have everything worked out.”

Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Maryland

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

The last time the Michigan 

football team went on the road, 
no one knew what to expect. 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
was 
making 
his 
coaching 

debut, the starting quarterback 
was a mystery, the defensive 
replacements for NFL Draft picks 
Jake Ryan and Frank Clark were 
unknown and fans wondered just 
how competetive the team would 
be.

One 
month 
after 
the 

Wolverines’ 24-17 loss to now-
No. 10 Utah, those questions have 
been answered. Jake Rudock is 
the starting quarterback. The 
defense is one of the deepest 
and highest-achieving units in 
the country. By outscoring its 
last three opponents 94-14 and 
entering the polls for the first time 
since Nov. 2, 2013, Michigan looks 
like it has the potential to surpass 
preseason expectations.

While everything is going 

right for the Wolverines (3-1), 
everything is going wrong for 
their opponent. Maryland (2-2) 
hosts Michigan after getting 
blown out last week by West 
Virginia, 45-6, and losing by 
three touchdowns to mid-major 
Bowling Green three weeks ago.

Here’s how things break down 

for Saturday:

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Maryland pass defense

Before the season, the edge 

would have gone to Maryland’s 
pass defense. With plenty of 
returning 
defensive 
backs 
— 

including star junior Will Likely 
— pass defense was expected 
to be one of the Terrapins’ best 
units, while the Wolverines rolled 
out a new quarterback without a 
clear replacement at receiver for 
second-round draft pick Devin 
Funchess.

However, 
Maryland’s 

secondary has underachieved, 
allowing opponents to complete 

60 percent of their passes for 267 
yards per game, and gave up 491 
yards in the air against Bowling 
Green.

Michigan has looked more 

capable in the passing game each 
week. The Wolverines rank just 
96th in the nation at 194 passing 
yards per game, but much of that 
has to do with the fact that they 
haven’t trailed in 11 quarters and 
have become a run-first team.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Maryland rush defense

Michigan has rushed for 732 

yards and 10 touchdowns in its 
last three games and showcases 
its depth more each week. With 
four running backs who have 
started multiple games in their 
collegiate careers, the Wolverines 
might not even have to use their 
lead back, junior De’Veon Smith, 
who tweaked his right ankle in 
last week’s win against BYU.

Likely to be behind early in 

stormy weather, Maryland can 
expect to see a lot of run plays 
Saturday. The question then 
becomes — after allowing over 
200 yards per game and 4.31 
yards per carry in its first four 
games — whether or not the 
defensive front can stop the 
inevitable.

Edge: Michigan

Maryland 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Perhaps one of the most 

lopsided matchups in the entire 
Big Ten, Michigan brings the 
nation’s fifth-best pass defense 
to College Park, while Maryland 
is still looking for a replacement 
after sixth-year senior C.J. Brown 
and his top two receiving targets 
graduated last year.

None of the Terrapins’ three 

quarterbacks have been up to the 
task yet, completing 50.4 percent 
on their passes and tossing a 
nation-leading 12 interceptions on 
just 125 pass attempts. Maryland’s 
starting quarterback for Saturday, 
junior Caleb Rowe, threw four 
picks in three quarters against 
West Virginia last week.

In Michigan’s corner is an 

upperclassman-heavy 
unit 

that is not only one of the most 
experienced in the country, but 
also one of the best. Whereas 
Maryland gave up 491 passing 
yards against Bowling Green, the 
Wolverines have given up 487 
passing yards all season.

Edge: Michigan

Maryland 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

In 
a 
matchup 
of 
two 

experienced and talented units, 
it’s tough to tell whose numbers 
hold more weight. Behind senior 

Brandon Ross, Maryland has 
piled up 196 yards per game and 
is gaining 5.85 yards per carry. 
Fortunately for the Terrapins, 
they can count on four or five 
backs in any given game to ensure 
their rushing attack is not only 
effective, but creative.

Rotating juniors and seniors 

in and out at will, Michigan’s 
run defense has shown flashes 
of dominance, allowing just 2.52 
yards per carry and 82 yards per 
game. Tack on 17 tackles for loss, 
and Michigan has every capability 
to stall Maryland.

Edge: Push

Special teams

If nothing else, Maryland has 

a clear edge over the Wolverines 
on special teams. Senior kicker 
Brad Craddock was a second-
team All American last season 
after going 18-for-19 in field goals 
and converting all 41 extra-point 
attempts. In the return game, Will 
Likely will likely be the Terrapins’ 
biggest threat to find the end zone, 
as he already has 337 punt return 
yards — 109 more than any other 
returner in the country.

Michigan 
has 
improved 

since last season in special 
teams. Sophomore safety Jabrill 
Peppers has shown glimpses 
of explosiveness in the return 
game, while seniors Blake O’Neill 
and Kenny Allen have brought 
consistency to the punting and 
kicking 
games, 
respectively, 

narrowing the gap evident last 
season between the two programs 
evident last season.

Make no mistake, Maryland’s 

special teams are as good as any 
in the country. The only question 
is — with winds and a hurricane 
knocking on the door — will 
it impact the game enough for 
Maryland to have a shot?

Edge: Maryland

Prediction: 
Michigan 
23, 

Maryland 0

Jake Rudock will look to build on last week’s performance against BYU.

Michigan heads into 
uncharted territory

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Before this season, the Big 

Ten announced 
that this week’s 
Michigan-
Maryland 
football 
game 

would be an 8 
p.m. 
kickoff. 

It appeared at 
the time that 
it might be a 
chance for Big 
Ten newcomer 
Maryland 
to 

knock off the 
Wolverines 
for 
a 
second 

straight year in their first visit to 
College Park.

Now, 
the 
night-game 

atmosphere is gone, and the 
Terrapins’ chances of an upset 
have dwindled as well.

Hurricane 
Joaquin, 
which 

could move through the mid-
Atlantic on Saturday night, forced 
the conference to move the game 
up to noon. The two teams will 
take field moving in opposite 
directions, with No. 22 Michigan 
(3-1) coming off a 31-0 rout of 
Brigham Young and Maryland 
(2-2) limping from a 45-6 loss at 
West Virginia. That makes the 
Wolverines a safer road bet than 
any time in recent memory.

Coming in as a favorite means 

the 
Wolverines 
must 
avoid 

disaster and eliminate variables, 
two tasks coach Jim Harbaugh 
has managed well this year.

Michigan 
has 
some 
room 

for error on Saturday, but the 
worst-case scenario is dropping 
a winnable game and leaving 
College Park at 0-1 in the Big 
Ten. To avoid that, fifth-year 
senior Jake Rudock must avoid 
turnovers and the defense must 
limit big plays.

In the former of those areas, 

Maryland has intercepted four 

passes and recovered just one 
fumble this season. On the other 
side, the Terrapins have four 
touchdown passes of at least 35 
yards, but their true big-play 
threat is punt returner Will 
Likely, who — despite being a 
cornerback — has a team-high 
489 all-purpose yards this season.

Some 
highlight-reel 
plays 

might be Maryland’s best chance 
to stay in the game, and Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh is on “high 
alert” in the special-teams game.

“The 
coverage 
units 
are 

going to have to be great, both 
the kickoff coverage and the 
punt coverage,” Harbaugh said 
Monday. “This return game that 
Maryland has is one of the best 
I’ve ever seen in college football, 
and so is their returner.”

The Wolverines can do their 

best to control Maryland’s return 
game, but they can’t account for 
the intangibles, namely the road 
environment and the weather.

But Michigan doesn’t intend to 

let those factors affect the game. It 
will keep the game plan the same, 
even in heavy rain or gusty winds.

“We’re kind of a weatherproof 

team, I think, so it’s not something 
that 
we’re 
really 
concerned 

about,” said tight ends coach Jay 
Harbaugh. “We’ll play anywhere. 
We’ll play on the moon, or Mars. 
They found water there, so maybe 
that’s our next spot.”

Still, the conditions aren’t ideal 

for Michigan’s first-ever trip to 
College Park. The Wolverines 
lost last year’s meeting in Ann 
Arbor, 23-16, missing out on their 
sixth win. A loss at Ohio State the 
following week dashed their bowl 
hopes for good.

While it’s too early in the 

season for a must-win game, 
Maryland is in a similar position. 
The Terrapins have struggled this 
season and face question marks at 
several positions. It’s Michigan’s 
job to exploit them, just as it was 
Maryland’s last year.

FOOTBALL

‘M’ blanks Maryland

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

In the Michigan women’s 

soccer team’s last match, it 
allowed its first goal in 39 
seconds 
to 
rival 

Michigan 
State. 
In Thursday’s match against 
Maryland, though, the defense 
led the way, making it difficult 
for the Terrapins to score.

The Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 

8-4 overall) put last week’s 
loss behind them, shutting out 
Maryland (0-4, 5-7) to win, 1-0, 
in College Park.

Michigan coach Greg Ryan 

said 
the 
Terrapin 
attack 

might be better than that of 
the Spartans. He knew the 
performance against Michigan 
State was not indicative of his 
team’s ability. With a relentless 
offensive attack and a defense 
that might as well have been 
a stone wall, the Wolverines 
outplayed Maryland throughout 
the game.

Michigan 
came 
close 
to 

scoring in the 10th minute of 
the game on its third corner 
kick. 
Senior 
midfielder 

Christina Murillo crossed it to 
the right side of the six-yard 
box, and after two deflections, 
junior forward Madisson Lewis 
had a chance to put the ball into 
the net at the left post. But her 
header sailed harmlessly over 
the goal.

Lewis had another shot on 

goal in the 17th minute off 
of a counterattack. After the 
Wolverines cut through the 
defense with an advantage, 
Lewis blasted a shot, but it was 
saved by Maryland goalkeeper 
Rachelle Beanlands.

“In the first half, we just 

continually attacked,” Ryan said. 
“The attack pressure we created 
was fantastic. We controlled the 
game because we had the ball 
more than they did.”

Finally, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

attack paid off in the 35th 
minute. A cross outside the 
18-yard 
box 
deflected 
off 

of a Terrapin defender, and 

freshman 
midfielder 
Abby 

Kastroll was in the right place 
at the most opportune time. 
Kastroll ended up with the ball 
at her feet and nobody but the 
goalkeeper in front of her, and 
she easily scored from six yards 
out, giving Michigan a 1-0 lead.

“(Kastroll) just dominated 

Maryland’s players when she 
was attacking throughout the 
game,” Ryan said. “Defensively, 
she was outstanding as well.”

Despite a couple of Maryland 

scoring 
opportunities, 
the 

Wolverines’ lead was intact at 
halftime, and with seven corner 
kick opportunities to boot. For 
comparison, before Thursday’s 
match, Michigan averaged 8.5 
corner kicks per game.

Maryland 
had 
limited 

opportunities for the equalizer 
due 
to 
Michigan’s 
stifling 

defense, which switched to 
a five-player back line in the 
second half. The Terrapins had 

a corner kick with 12 minutes 
left in the game, but the service 
hit the outside of the net. The 
Wolverine defense continued to 
be nearly impenetrable for the 
rest of the contest, as it earned 
its fifth shutout of the season.

“(Compared to the match 

against Michigan State), our 
focus, our concentration and 
the energy we brought to the 
game (were) what was really 
different,” Ryan said.

While the defense played 

virtually mistake-free ball, the 
offense had many opportunities 
to score, but failed to capitalize 
numerous times. Still, the sign 
of a more aggressive offense 
is promising as Michigan gets 
deeper into Big Ten conference 
play.

“I told them after the game, 

‘You guys have found yourselves 
again,’ ” Ryan said. “ ‘(How you 
played tonight) is what you have 
to bring into every game.’ ”

WOMEN’S SOCCER
What to watch for Saturday

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

With a Category 4 hurricane 

bearing down on Capital One 
Field at Byrd Stadium, Saturday’s 
game between Michigan and 
Maryland was moved from 8 p.m. 
to noon ET.

That likely won’t stop Michigan 

fans from showing up, as the No. 
22 Wolverines are ranked in the 
Top 25 for the first time since 
November 2013, and expectations 
under coach Jim Harbaugh are as 
high as ever.

Assuming the game is played, 

here’s what to watch for when 
Michigan takes on Maryland.

1. Raining cats and dogs

While the earlier start could 

help shield fans and the athletes 
from the potentially catastrophic 
conditions, 
it’s 
not 
like 
the 

Wolverines and Terrapins will be 
squaring off in a sunny meadow.

Winds of around 20 miles per 

hour are expected throughout 
the game, which is more than 
enough to impact play calling for 
both teams. Don’t expect to see 
many pass attempts or long field 
goals, and look for both teams to 
turn to their running backs on 
offense.

A run-heavy game bodes well 

for Michigan’s stout defensive 
line, and it could also mean a 
quick game — an added bonus 
with the hurricane approaching.

2. Will De’Veon Smith play?

Michigan’s workhorse tailback 

injured his ankle in the third 
quarter against BYU but said after 
the game he expected to be ready 
for Maryland. However, he also 
wore a boot as a precautionary 
measure, and Harbaugh was mum 
on the running back’s status in his 
Monday press conference.

Smith’s status shouldn’t affect 

the outcome of the game — the 
Wolverines are heavy favorites 
— but it could be an indicator of 
how severe the injury is. Then 
again, with a stable of capable 
backs itching to play, Michigan 
could opt to rest Smith even if he 
is healthy, just to be safe.

If Smith isn’t in the lineup, look 

for redshirt sophomore Ty Isaac 
and junior Derrick Green to get 
the lion’s share of the carries, with 
redshirt junior Drake Johnson as 
a change-of-pace back.

3. Fear of a letdown/looking 
ahead

Coming off a 31-0 win over 

BYU, there is some risk of a 
letdown for the newly ranked 
Wolverines. What’s more, No. 
16 Northwestern comes to Ann 
Arbor a week later, setting up a 
dangerous bookend around an 
underwhelming Maryland team.

But with Harbaugh at the 

helm, you can expect Michigan 
to be well prepared, if not at peak 
levels of motivation. Harbaugh 
said his message to his team after 
the win over BYU was simple: 
“Congratulations, 
outstanding 

game and onward.” If that isn’t 
enough, the Wolverines can also 
look to the fact that the Terrapins 
beat them at the Big House last 
season.

For Maryland, knocking off a 

ranked Michigan team, however 

unlikely, could inject life into 
an otherwise ugly season. The 
Wolverines aren’t on upset watch, 
but don’t be stunned if they don’t 
look as polished as they have in 
recent weeks.

4. In all Likely-hood

Maryland’s star cornerback/

return specialist Will Likely gives 
fits to special teams units, just like 
he does to writers with limited 
vocabulary who want to describe 
a probable series of events.

Harbaugh has sung Likely’s 

praises all week, and Michigan 
will likely avoid him all game if 
it can. Still, Likely will make his 
impact felt just by being in the 
Wolverines heads. He is averaging 
28.1 yards per punt return and 
has already returned two for 
touchdowns this season. He’s 
almost as dangerous on kickoffs, 
where he is averaging 21.7 yards 
per return and has an 85-yard 
touchdown return.

Punting to Will Likely is a bad 

idea. Don’t expect Michigan to do 
it.
