Borders files
for Chapter 11
bankruptcy

GE Capital to loan
Ann Arbor-based
company $505M
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
and ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor and
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor-based book-
seller Borders Group, Inc. filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy yes-
terday morning.
The company, which owns
Borders and Waldenbooks, filed
for protection in U.S. Bankrupt-
cy Court early yesterday. Accord-
ing to the bankruptcy filing, the
company said it will close about
30 percent of its stores nation-
wide within the next few weeks
- including its location at the
Arborland Mall on Washtenaw
Avenue.'
"It has become increasingly
clear that in light of the envi-
ronment of curtailed customer
spending, our ongoing discus-
sions with publishers and other
vendor related parties, and the
company's lack of liquidity, Bor-
ders Group does not have the

capital resources it needs to
be a viable competitor," Bor-
ders Group President and CEO
Michael Edwards wrote ina Bor-
ders Group press release issued
yesterday.
Employees at the Borders
flagship location on State Street
declined to comment on the state
of the company yesterday.
According to the company's
bankruptcy petition, as of Dec.
25, 2010 the company holds
assets of about $1.28 billion and
liabilities of about $1.29 billion.
The company also operates 642
stores nationwide and employs
about 19,500 employees.
Borders secured a $505 mil-
lion loan from GE Capital to
finance its day-to-day operations
while it's in bankruptcy, accord-
ing to the press release. How-
ever, the loan is pending court
approval.
"This financing should enable
Borders to meet its obligations
going forward so that our stores
continue to be competitive for
customers in terms of goods,
services and the shopping expe-
rience," Edwards wrote in the
statement.

Driving into the future

Aa the automotive induatry rebounds
from the receaaion and responda to
demanda for more fuel-efficient vehi-
cles, University students and fatuity
are helping to create an environmen-
tally friendly car of the future.
Formed to participate in the EcoCar
2 Collegiate Advanced Vehicle Tech-
nology Competition, members of the
University's EcoCar Team are work-
ing to design and build s car that mini-
mizes gas emissions while maintaining
performance and utility, according to
Heath Hofmann, an associate professor
of electrical engineering and computer
science and the team's co-adviser.
Sponsored by the US. Department
of Energy and General Motors, the
three-year competition features 16 cho-
sen teams from various universities in
North America.

According to Hoffman, the first
year of the competition is devoted to
the design, modeling and simulation of
the vehicle. The team will then receive
a stock vehicle and spend. the next
two years bringing its design to life by
utilizing components and hardware
either donated by the competition's
other aponsora, such as A123 Systems
and dSPACE, or obtained by the team
through fundraising.
Ultimately, the EcoCar team will
bring its finished product to the Gener-
al Motors proving grounds to compete
against universities in various tests
including miles per gallon, consumer
acceptability and acceleration.
According to Hoffman, the Ecu-
Car team provides opportunities for
students from all backgrounds to get
involved, especially those interested in

marketing and public outreach.
"A lot of the competition of course
focuses around engineering, but there's
also a sort of abusiness aspect to it and
also an outreach aspect to it," Hoff-
man said. "We're not only interested in
recruiting engineers to the team, we're
also interested in business majors and
communications majors."
Rackham student Michael Woon,
the team's student leader, said General
Motors has often hired students who
participated in the competition.
"To get hired might be the initial
incentive, but the reason you would
want to stay in it is because you love
what you're doing, the work is exciting,
the people that you're with is a good
group and you want to succeed," Woon
said.

LANSING, Mich.
Gov. Snyder names
new director of
Michigan DELEG
Gov. Rick Snyder has appointed
the managing partner of a Detroit
law firm the new director of the
Michigan Department of Energy,
Labor and Economic Growth.
The Republican governor said
in a statement yesterday that Ste-
ven Hilfinger of the Detroit office
of Foley & Lardner LLP will begin
serving Feb. 28 and replaces Andy
Levin. The statement says Hil-
finger is an expert in corporate
acquisitions, restructurings and
regulatory affairs.
Like Snyder, Hilfinger is a certi-
fied public accountant and lawyer.
He received his bachelor's degree
in 1984 from University of Michi-
gan and law degree from North-
western University in 1987.
Snyder thanked Levin, appoint-
ed by former Democratic Gov.
Jennifer Granholm, for his service
and says he played an important
role during the transition.
WASHINGTON, D.C.
GOP seeks to cut
funds for consumer
protection agency
The House Republican budget-
cuttingbillwould shrink spending
for the Obama administration's
newly created agency designed
to protect consumers who have
mortgages, credit cards or use
other financial services.
The legislation would limit
spending for the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau to $80 mil-
lion. The agency was created by
the financial overhaul law that
President Barack Obama and the
Democratic-run Congress enact-
ed in July.
Nearly all Republicans opposed
the legislation. Now that they con-
trol the House, the GOP is propos-
ing cuts in the budgets of agencies
that would carry out the new
financial regulatorylaw.
Without the Republican cuis
the consumer protection agency
was on track to receive $134 mil-
lion this year. Obama has request-
ed $329 million for the agency for
next year.
DENVER, Colo.
Rescued lions from
Bolivia arrive at
wildlife sanctuary
Twenty-five lions, most of them
rescued from Bolivian circuses,
arrived in Colorado on yesterday
to start their new lives at a wildlife
sanctuary.
The 14 males and 11 females
landed at Denver International
Airport around 4:30 p.m. The jet-
liner pulled into a maintenance
hangar and police officers armed
with assault rifles stood by as a
precaution.
The animals were rescued from
deplorable conditions after a law

was passed last year in Bolivia pro-
hibiting all performances involv-
ing animals, Animal Defenders
International said. Most of the
lions were dehydrated and suf-
fered from eye and foot infections
when rescued, the group has said.

Police Col. Muhammad Zaini
says fishermen discovered the
rickety, 45-foot (14-meter) boat
off the coast of westernmost Aceh
province and towed it to shore
earlyyesterday.
He says the passengers - all
males belonging to the ethnic
Rohingya minority - had run
out of food and water and were
severely dehydrated and weak.
One man-told investigators they
were fleeing violence and pressure

ROTC
From Page 1A
of the bill by Obama, Defense
Secretary Robert Gates and Con-
gress, the U.S. military is begin-
ning to educate military members
about the LGBT community and
foster tolerance in the pre-repeal
phase, according to the Depart-
ment of Defense website.
Jan Malaikal, chair of the
Army Officer Education program
at the University, said she could
not comment on the current pol-
icy for treatment of LGBT ROTC
members due to the changing
nature of the law.
LSA sophomore Adam
Kouroupas, who is in the Uni-
versity's ROTC program, said he
hasn't noticed many changes in
the ROTC Air Force branch in
anticipation of the law.

"It hasn't come up, and I think
that's a good sign," Kouroupas
said. "Everyone here is smart
enough to realize that times
aren't like they used to be, and
things are changing."
Kouroupas also said he
thinks the University's ROTC
would accept any members who
revealed their sexual identity.
"Our captains always tell us
that diversity in the military is
the best thing for it," Kouroupas
said. "I think (if someone came
out) it would be fine. People are
afraid of the stereotype...We've
been getting up at 5 a.m. together
for the past couple of years now.
We've gotten pretty close, so I
don't think that would change
anything."
Ariana Bostian-Kentes, the
University's Spectrum Center
programming coordinator, said
she thinks little will change

within military operations if
DADT is certified.
"I think that the day that it's
actually repealed is going to be a
non-event," Bostian-Kentes said.
"I don't think that there's going
to be any sort of mass comings-
out. I think the only thing that
will really change is that they'll
have one more class on some sort
of diversity training."
Bostian-Kentes said her for-
mer partner was a member of the
U.S. military. In her experience,
Bostian-Kentes said many ser-
vicemen and servicewomen have
already disclosed their sexual-
ity to close co-workers and even
larger groups of people within
the service.
"(This) is not something that's
new and radical," Bostian-Kentes
said. "A lot of people knew about
me. I attended two military balls
as her date, and we did not catch a

lot of flack for it. The bottom line
was that she did her job well, and
that's what mattered."
David Halperin, a W. H. Auden
Distinguished University Prof. of
the history and theory of sexual-
ity, said when he was teaching
at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in the 1980s, he
learned of a gay student who was
kicked out of ROTC for reveal-
ing his sexual orientation after
enrolling in the program.
"The ban on non-heterosex-
uals serving openly in the U.S.
military is one of the last instanc-
es of formally institutionalized
homophobia at the federal level,"
Halperin said. "There has never
been any coherent reason provid-
ed for kicking non-heterosexual
people out of the military or pre-
venting them from serving."
To help solve any potential
problems, Bostian-Kentes said

she is planning to offer the Spec-
trum Center's resources to the
ROTC program and the signifi-
cant others of any ROTC mem-
bers.
"Military partners are even
more invisible than LGBT active
duty service members," Bostian-
Kentes said. "I'm looking ahead
and seeing that there is room for
programming around that."
Halperin added that the repeal
would also affect the scholarship
guidelines of ROTC programs on
all college campuses if the pro-
gram is open to gay or lesbian
members.
"People who want to take
advantage of ROTC scholarships
to finance their college education
will be able to do so regardless
of their sexual orientation," Hal-
perin said. "There will no longer
be a certain kind of inequality
written into law."


BORDERS
From Page 1A
Borders will continue to allow
customers to use gift cards and
its Borders Rewards program,
according to the press release.
John Pottow, a professor at
the University's Law School, said
Chapter 11 bankruptcy involves a
reorganization of the debts of a
company.
"You get a protection from all
your creditors so they can't sue
you for not paying your debts,"
Pottow said. "You get to hide for

about a year or so."
Edwards will be able to con-
tinue to run the company, Pot-
tow said, but on behalf of Borders
Group's creditors rather than its
shareholders.
The money the company
has borrowed from GE Capital
should help Borders with financ-
ing while executives accomplish
their reorganization plan, Pot-
tow said. He added that the reor-
ganization plan is like a "haircut
on debt," in which Borders agrees
to pay its creditors a fraction of
what they owe.
"Bankruptcy is not good," Pot-

tow said. "Some people are going
to lose their jobs."
Keith Taylor, coordinator for
the University's Undergraduate
Creative Writing Program, was
an employee at Borders from 1981
to 1989. He worked at the first
store brothers Tom and Louis
Borders opened on State Street
in 1971.
Taylor said the initial Borders
store was a unique concept and
was very popular.
"The whole idea of a book
superstore was brand new," Tay-
lor said. "In the early ages, Bor-
ders was one of the first ones."

Taylor said he left Borders
because he felt uncomfortable
with the company's corporate
atmosphere. He said he thinks
that starting in 1985, the book-
store began to make poor busi-
ness choices which ultimately led
to the company's downfall.
"They ruined themselves,"
Taylor said. "They made all the
wrong decisions."
Taylor said he feels no sym-
pathy for the store because of its
financial troubles.
"It's a junk store now," Taylor
said. "It doesn't deserve to live."
He added that he's concerned

about the financial security of the
book industry in general.
"The book business has
changed entirely," Taylor said.
"The music business disappeared
almost overnight; it's taking the
book business a lot longer."
LSA senior Aneka Kaul said
she is upset that Borders and
other bookstores are having fis-
cal issues since more people are
buying books online. Kaul, who
grew up in Ann Arbor, added that
the Arborland Borders store has
sentimental value to her.
"I've been going there since I
was little," she said.


SUSTAINABILITY
From Page 1A
letter.
Rackham student Devi Glick,
who studies in the School of
Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment and isa member of SSI,
said she hopes the letter will
encourage Coleman to further
her commitment to sustainabil-
ity.
"Coleman is always saying
that she wants to hear what the
students want, she wants to see
students work for something,"
Glick said. "She's not going to
go out and initiate it if there
isn't demonstrative student sup-
port."
The letter doesn't make new
propositions, Glick said, but
instead pushes for the Univer-
sity to take stronger stances on
current sustainability opera-
tions throughout campus.
"We took the goals that are
already being discussed, and
this letter basically encourages
them to be aggressive and bold
with whatever they want these
goals to be," Glick said. "The
value added in this letter wasn't
something new, it was us say-
ing, 'Don't just do what you're
on track to do, but do something
that really shows leadership."'
Glick said the organization
has been successful so far in

generating support for sus-
tainability efforts on campus.
She credited the SSI's involve-
ment with the yearlong Cam-
pus Sustainability Integrated
Assessment project, which is a
combined effort between the
SSI, the Office of Campus Sus-
tainability and the Graham
Sustainability Institute to eval-
uate sustainability on campus.
At the end of the semester, the
partnership plans to present a
recommendation reportto Cole-
man on how to improve the Uni-
versity's sustainability efforts.
Glick said the SSI is hoping
the letter will benefit from the
"momentum" and "involve-
ment" generated by the Inte-
grated Assessment project.
Glick said the group's letter
isn't meant to be critical of Uni-
versity administrators, but
it is intended to further the
University's commitment to
sustainability.
"The tone of it is complete-
ly positive because (Coleman)
responds to positiveness and
student encouragements, so
we're not going to write a let-
ter that's negative or critical
because that's not the correct
venue, and that's not how we
see it," Glick said.
Glick said Coleman's sup-
port is vital to foster the
growth of a more sustainable
campus.

"A lot of the changes that are
needed are operational things
at the University," she said.
"Those aren't things that a club
would raise money for. Those
are things that the University
has to provide the money to do."
The organization's letter will
demonstrate to Coleman that
students are passionate about
sustainability efforts, Alexan-
der said.
"I think what President Cole-
man is looking for is a well-
rounded look at sustainability,
so that it's not just the faculty
or the operating people on cam-
pus, but that it's also the stu-
dents that are involved," he said.
"So I think this letter will be
very effective in showing thai
we've had this broad coopera-
tion between the major groups
on campus."

Not a smart cut
Teach for America funding should be maintained
While President Barack Obama currently has a lot of
issues he's trying to resolve, the one he keeps empha-
sizing the importance of education. That is why it's so
puzzling that Teach for America - an organization that puts recent
college graduates in teaching positions in low-income communities
- is losing about $20 million in funding as a result of Obama's new
budget. Without proper funding, the reach of the number of gradu-
ates TFA can employ and the number of schools it can help will be

a

drastically limited.
cuts are inevitable. They're happening
everywhere and to everyone - including
the University - but like Washington Post
reporter Richard Cohen wrote in a Feb. 15
article, "The federal budget, now $3.8 tril-
lion, will never be balanced by trimming this
or that program." Not. only will cuts to TFA
do minimal damage to the deficit, but the pro-
gram is too valuable for Washington to allow
it to be sacrificed.
TFA is an extremely unique program that
equally benefits students and teachers. With
the unemployment rate still above 9 percent,
jobs for college graduates aren't exactly plen-
tiful. TFA provides college graduates with a
rare opportunity to receive real-world work
experience before being thrust into a com-
petitive job market.
There are also a variety of benefits for the
schools and students in the districts that
TFA works in. TFA teachers are well edu-
cated and positively contribute to the com-
munities that they enter. TFA sends college
graduates all over the country to schools that
are in desperate need of help and otherwise'
couldnt afford full-time educators. The pro-
posed cuts to the program would take away
more than 400 TFA teachers and put a huge
dent in what the program can accomplish.

Schools and students need the expertise and
knowledge that TFA teachers have to offer,
and taking that away would be a deterrent to
public education in the country. Education is
already below par by many standards, and by
decreasing resources for TFA, Washington is
only moving in the wrong direction in fixing
this problem.
The program is particularly popular in
Ann Arbor. Many University students rely on
TFA for a post-graduation job and are able to
take their experiences from college to schools
that need them. In 2008, the University had
the highest number of applicants to the TFA
program. And according to a May 9, 2010
Michigan Daily article, 7 percent of the Uni-
versity's 2009 graduating class applied for the
program. Additionally, last spring, the Uni-
versity partnered with the program to bring a
TFA chapter to Detroit. It's clear that Univer-
sity students are dedicated, and dependent,
on this program.
Obama needs to recognize how impor-
tant TFA is for college students and public
schools. It simultaneously employs recent
graduates and strengthens schools that are
in need. Cutting funding to TFA goes against
everything Obama has said about the impor-
tance of education for the nation's future.

that simply won't go away.

tors to global
warming. Most
also know about ways to decrease
our carbon footprint. But there are
a vast number of people in the know
who fail to take action. It's almost
painful how many times my room-
mates will vacate a room and leave
enough lamps on to light Angel
Hall. I'm certainly not without fault
here, but the idea of melting icecaps
is a thought that often looms in my
mind.
It would appear that flyers and
apocalyptic news flashes simply
don't grab the public's attention
like they used to. Maybe the spirit
of competition is the jump start that
University students need to actu-
ally do what they know they should
be doing. This competitive nature
is exactly what the student group
Kill-a-Watt is using to try to moti-
vate the campus.
Kill-a-Watt is an idea that was
sparked atbthe University of Central
Florida ,and has been generously
loaned to Engineering junior Matt
Friedrichs and LSA junior Katie
Kent, who are the co-founders of
the University of Michigan branch.
It's a campus-wide competition
that pits residence hall against resi-
dence hall to see who can reduce
their energy use by the largest per-
centage.

This reduction in energy use
is reliant on the occupants of the
residence halls around campus.
Kill-a-Watt is asking students to do
the little things that save energy -
turn off lights, televisions, laptops,
unplug phone chargers not in use,
etc. The hope is that the sum of
these small efforts will be reflected
in the University's monthly energy
bill and, more importantly, our car-
bon footprint.
The United States is notoriously
bad when it comes to carbon emis-
sions. According to Carbon Foot-
print Ltd, the average American
emits about 20 metric tons of car-
bon per year. This is about 16 metric
tons more than people through-
out the rest of the world. Even the
world's average carbon footprint is
too large to combat climate change.
Ideally, average world carbon emis-
sions should be at about 2 metric
tons per person - 10 times less car-
bon than Americans are currently
emitting. Ideal goals and realistic
goals are drastically different, but
the room for improvement is defi-
nitely there.
One of the biggest challenges
Kill-a-Watt faces is getting a level
of participation needed to actually
make a difference. "At a school as
big Michigan," Friedrichs wrote in
an e-mail, "it is always hard to get a
lot of students engaged in an event
like this. To overcome this chal-
lenge we will combine competition,
publicity and incentives to engage
students." Friedrichs explained
that the publicity campaigns will
go "beyond a sticker on the wall"
by tapping into existing networks
of resident advisors, the housing
staffs and the program Planet Blue
to promote the event and remind
students of ways to reduce energy.
The hope is to take advantage of
the influence that residential advi-

sors carry with their halls. This can
be achieved by working the Kill-a-
Watt challenge into residence hall
meetings or with friendly remind-
ers to turn off lights. Though it
doesn't seem like much, the point
of the competition is to show how
doing these little things can make a
remarkable difference. What could
set Kill-a-Watt apart from similar
groups is the tangible results it will
provide. The percent reduction of
total monthly energy use for each
residence hall will be reported so
students will see the difference
they're making.
Kill-a-Watt
can provide
tangible results.
Perhaps the greatest asset the
group has to offer is the spirit of
competition and prospect of prizes.
University students live for com-
petition, whether it's in the class-
room or around campus. Sprinkle
in a little cash or gift cards and
Kill-a-Watt could have a winning
combination to become a reputable
organization.
Though Kill-a-Watt is still in the
production phase, the hope is to
begin the 2011 fall semester with
this month-long competition. The
ultimate goal of reducing our car-
bon footprint is something that
should be admired. With any luck
Kill-a-Watt will surpass the scope
of the competition and make energy
efficient practices a part of the way
of life for University students.

LET TERS O I

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Personal choice is limited
by government regulations
TO THE DAILY:
On the subject of Michelle Obama's efforts
to fight obesity, Michigan Daily columnist
Dar-Wei Chen makes the false claim that no
government official, not even Ms. Obama,
"is trying to tell anyone how to live," ('Let's
move' toward 'socialism', 2/13/11). Alas, if
only this were true.
Chen may not be aware, but last November,
the Food and Drug Administration proposed
forcing cigarette companies to print pictures
of dead and dying people on its products to
deter smokers. Government officials in New
York went a step further by requiring con-
venience store owners to post pictures of
charred lungs and yellow teeth in shop win-
dows. Opponents of the law sued on First
Amendment grounds, it was struck down and
the city appealed the decision.
Study abroad programs in
Israel are a safe option
TO THE DAILY:
I am responding to Hamdan Azhar's view-
point discussing the situation in Israel and
Palestine (A Palestinian-Israeli approach,
2/2/11) As a member of WolvPAC, I would
like to clarify some issues that arose in this
article. First and foremost, I want to stress
the fact that many universities around the
United States have a study abroad program to
Israel that has been both beneficial and, more
importantly, a safe trip.
A trip to Israel could provide University

What about Four Loko, the alcoholic ener-
gy drink that was regulated out of existence
last year by the FDA? Government officials
decided that no one should be allowed to
consume the equivalent of a cup of coffee
and a couple shots of Vodka. There's also
medical marijuana and its many users, who
are still subject to federal SWAT team raids,
even in states where the substance has been
legalized.
But even if we remain within the bounds of
Chen's topic - obesity - we find prohibition-
ist government action. He might remember,
for instance, the city of San Francisco ban-
ning McDonalds Happy Meals last year.
So not only are government officials telling
us "how to live," they are actively forcing us
- at gunpoint if you're the victim of a federal
raid - not to drink, or eat, or smoke certain
products.

students with a culturally enriching and
historical experience that many other coun-
tries simply could not offer. Azhar noted that
there have been safety concerns with stu-
dents traveling to Israel, but I believe there
are always safety threats when an individual
travels outside the U.S. Multiple organiza-
tions - for example, Birthright - take stu-
dents to Israel and have never experienced
any major problems. On another note, I agree
that a joint Palestinian-Israeli study abroad
program could be successful, but the focus
for WolvPAC is just to create a study abroad
program to Israel.

Bring bullying into thelight

s


When I reflect back on this past semester, I acknowl-
edge the trials that I faced with a grain of salt. The
attacks I confronted from former Michigan assistant
attorney general Andrew Shirvell were harsh and
inexcusable by anyone's standards. The University,
however, responded with a unified voice in support of
the LGBT community, to tell Shirvell and those who
hold similar views that such conduct is not permissible
in our community and an otherwise horrible incident
was turned into something positive for Michigan.
I was lucky. I was a member of a community that
taught me how to handle a situation like this, how
to hold strong and how to remain poised in the face
of adversity. I belong to a community that would not
stand for unwarranted attacks on any targeted person
or group, no matter what kind of bully.
But not every student has this resource today in
America. It saddens me to know that while some of us
are privileged to live in communities that protect our
students from bullies, other students across the nation
aren't as lucky, and may not have access to a supportive
community.
We live in a nation that sits idly by as those around
us are taunted, mocked, ridiculed and even attacked
because they are different. We live in a nation where
bullying is looked on as a rite of passage for students.
Bullying is treated as a problem without a solution
- an issue schools must simply cope with. Sixty to 80
percent of all students are bullied during their primary
and secondary education, and bullying victims are up
to nine times more likely to consider suicide during
this time. Despite the epidemic in schools, many school
administrators still view bullying as a non-issue. Worst
of all, students who are bullied don't saying anything
to administrators for fear of what their bullies may
do to them. This is why students at the University are
standing up and fighting back. On Saturday, Feb. 19

students at the University will be traveling to the Ypsi-
lanti District Library to support the kick-off of a state-
wide Anti-Bullying campaign. All students deserve
their chance to feel safe and protected when they go to
school, and University students will be taking the first
step to ensure that happens.
We must advocate for nothing less than zero-tol-
erance bullying policies in our communities if we
want attitudes toward bullying to change. There is no
excuse for anyone who witnesses bullying and does not
step in. We all have to be brave enough to take a stand
whenever necessary and challenge those around us to
do the same. We need our towns, cities and states to
create support networks for those who have been tar-
geted, no matter what they have been targeted for. We
need policies that reward those who say something
when they combat bullying in schools.
Students in our country deserve communities that
won't supportstanding idly by. We must prove to those
students who are terrified to go to school everyday
because of what others might think, say or do to them
that they have a support network now - not that they
will have one in the future.
Bullying should not be seen as a precursor to vio-
lence, but should be treated as an act of violence. If
we continue to ignore the impact of bullying on our
schools, we all will be committing an act of violence
against our country's youth.
I hope every community feels the need to take action
to protect their youth and stop bullying. The Michigan
Student Assembly will be providing free transporta-
tion to the anti-bullying conference this Saturday, Feb.
19. If you would like to reserve a spot, please visit www.
msa.umich.edu. All students are welcome.
Chris Armstrong is the president of the Michigan Student
Assembly. He can be reached at charmstr@umich.edu.

'M' tops Indiana with five Seniors reflect on time at'M'

3-pointers, shoot
50 percent from
beyond the arc
By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
After losing to in-state rival
Michigan State last Sunday, the
Michigan women's basketball
team needed to regain its mojo
and get back on track, especially
with just four games left in the
regular
season. It INDIANA 76

offensively
against the Spartans all night and
scored just 56 points.
Luckily for the Wolverines,
they played a team on Wednes-
day that gave them the shots they
were looking for - and they took
advantage of it.
Michigan (8-5 Big Ten, 15-10
overall) shot an incredible 50 per-
cent from beyond the 3-point arc
en route to a 88-76 win over Indi-
ana at Crisler Arena. The Wol-
verines had five players score in
double figures and a sixth player
who scored nine points.
"Making (3-point) shots is a
big part of our game," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said after
the game. "We had open shots and
we made them."

Michigan hockey seniors
Scooter Vaughan, Louie Capo-
russo, Chad Langlais and Matt
Rust were in unanimous agree-
ment on Wednesday.
The topic? Their most memo-
rable moment playing at Yost
Ice Arena.
Their answer? They all
agreed that the one game they
each would never forget came
three years ago when Capo-
russo scored the game-winning
goal with just 20.3 seconds left
to propel then-No. 2 Michigan
over then-No. 8 Notre Dame.
"(Notre Dame) played a great
game that night," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said after
practice on Wednesday. "We
had a line of (Brandon) Nau-
rato, (Travis) Turnbull, and
Caporusso and they ended up
scoring the goal on a faceoff.
That was a huge goal, and for a
freshman to score in that game,
that was a big game.
"It was one of those games
where it just took on a life of its
own. They'd have to remember
that."
The 13th-ranked Wolverines'
entire senior class will be hon-
ored at Yost during their final
regular season home game
on Saturday against Western
Michigan. The seven senior
class members - minus goal-
tender Shawn Hunwick who
will not be honored this week-
end, as he is projected to return
for his last remaining year of
eligibility - boast an impres-

DREAM ACT
From Page 1A
The DREAM Act -which would
only be applicable for people who
entered the United States prior to
age 16 years and lived in the coun-
try for five years - was voted down
by the U.S. Senate in December.
The event began with a speech
from Noe Ortega, a research asso-
ciate for the National Forum on
Higher Education for the Public
Good. Ortega, who specializes in
studies of undocumented students
and higher education access, said
it's important to discuss the group
of underrepresented students that
the country "chooses to systemati-
cally deny" higher education.
Ortega said Michigan is esti-
mated to have between 55,000 and
125,000 undocumented students,
which makes up about 1.6 percent
of the state's total population. He
said because these students are a
significant part of the population, it
is vital to allow them to have access
to education.
Over the summer, Ortega stud-
ied 59 private institutions in Michi-
gan. His study included four-year,
two-year and private colleges and
universities and analyzed the dif-
ferences involved in admittance and
financial aid at each of the colleges.

Ortega said his research con-
cluded that 22 of the institutions
had "favorable policies" that allow
undocumented students to attend
college. In these institutions, the
students have different tuition
rates; some charge in-state tuition
while others charge undocument-
ed students out-of-state or interna-
tional tuition. None of the schools
offered federal financial aid for the
students.
Public Policy and Rackham
graduate student Marisol Ramos
also spoke at the event and said
she worked with youth groups in
New York that were interested in
advocating for the DREAM Act
before moving to Michigan. She
said she thinks the political and
social climate in the United States
has grown increasingly tense since
Sept. 11, and America's youth has
responded by mobilizing and fight-
ing for what they believe in.
Because of the increased secu-
rity after the attacks on the World
Trade Center, Ramos said, there
was a shift in efforts from the cre-
ation of legislation for comprehen-
sive immigration reform to building
a border and increasing security.
Laura Corrunker, a Ph.D.
candidate in anthropology at
Wayne State University, has been
researching the DREAM Act for
the past year and said she believes

in "activist anthropology," which
she defines as giving back to the
community while simultaneously
conducting research.
"You get a chance to give back,
especially to the people who are so
willing to give you their time," Cor-
runker said.
She added that when people
hear real-life stories from undoc-
umented citizens, they are more
inclined to pay attention to issues
like the DREAM act, which is why
events like the one held last night
are so important in garnering sup-
port for the issue.
Jose Franco, co-founder of One
Michigan, said learning about the
DREAM Act gave him something
to fight for. Growing up undocu-
mented, Franco said he realized it
would be hard to attend college, so
he stopped attending school and
let his grades slip. Upon learning
about the DREAM Act, he realized
he could change the direction his
life was heading.
After corresponding with other
undocumented students online, he
organized the Michigan DREAM
Camp last year, which spurred the
creation of One Michigan. He said
the program allows youth to be
honest about their legal status.
"If people know about your sta-
tus, you're safer because more peo-
ple can help you," Franco said.

and make him feel welcome,"
Day said.
Other judges included Jan
Brandon, wife of University Ath-
letic Director Dave Brandon,
Dan Sygar, Letterwinners M
Club president and a University
alum, and Elise Ray, an Olympic
bronze medalist and University
alum.
Before the event began, the
auditorium filled with student-
athletes waiting for their turn
to perform. LSA freshman and
Michigan wrestler Jordan Smith
said he was enthusiastic about
going on stage.

"We're going to be really
funny. Probably the best one out
there," Smith said, of the wres-
tling team's act.
Smith said the team members
put together their skit in about
an hour.
"It was rigorous though," he
said.
But other teams, like the
Michigan Marching Band, spent
multiple days practicing each
week for the past month to pre-
pare. The work paid off as the
band took first place for their
"Barbie and Ken" Michigan-
themed skit.
Engineering senior Kris-
ten Angonese, a member of
the Michigan Marching Band,
expressed her excitement after
the show.
"The last couple years we've
been doing really well, but it's
nice to finally win," she said.
Other performances were the
men's rowing team's Pokemon
skit, which included elaborate
costumes and girls dressed as
lightning and fire being carried
acrossthe stage during the Poke-
mon battles.
Many skits included partial
nudity. The men's swimming
and diving team ended with each
member in a skimpy Speedo dur-
ing their "Somewhere Over the

Rainbow" skit.
"I hope our (football) players
don't come out in what they had
on," Hoke said while judging the
men's swimming and divingskit.
LSA senior and Michigan
football player Ryan Van Bergen
said the football team had three
practices a week to prepare for
the event. The team finished in
second place with its "Hidden
Talents" song and dance act.
"We found a place for every-
one who wanted an opportu-
nity ... kind of a hodge-podge of
everybody," Van Bergen said,
adding that many of the players
have hidden musical talents.
University alum and former
Michigan football player Zoltan
Mesko, who is a player with the
New England Patriots, was also
a judge at the event. After the
show, Mesko said he enjoyed
the experience and would defi-
nitely participate as a judge in
the future.
"I thought there (were) some
surprises," Mesko said. "There
were alot ofnon-dancing acts."
ESPN analyst Adam Schefter,
a University and Michigan Daily
alum, also judged the teams at
Mock Rock. It was "a great night
for a great cause," he said.
"You can see a lot of work
went into this," Schefter added.

size advantage over his counter-
part.
Most point BEN

- almost none On Men's
can claim to be Bosketboll
6-foot-4, which is
what Morris measures inat.
But as the sophomore found out
Wednesday night - and as Michi-
gan itself found out - Illinois is a
different animal. Staring across at
him on every possession was Fight-
ing Illini guard Demetri McCamey,
a 6-foot-3 physical specimen who
wasn'tgoingto let Morris just dance
his way into the lane like he does so
often.
And even if he did manage to get
into the paint, Morris had a trio of
skyscraper Illinois forwards stand-
ing in his path. It's no surprise then
that Morris went just 4-for-12 from
the field, that the Wolverines shot
just 37.3 percent for the game or that
Michigan made just 2-of-18 of its
3-pointers.
The Wolverines couldn't pull this
one off, missing agreatopportunity
to collect a Top-50 RPIlwin on the
road and put themselves solidly,
on the NCAA Tournament bubble.
Instead,they're leftwalkingthe
same tightrope they were already
on, just with even less margin of
error.
But Michigan can live with that.
From the beginning, Illinois,
with its army of lengthy bigs and
its top-ranked Big Ten defense, was
going to present a different kind of
challenge. Michigan coach John
Beilein knew it would take a monu-
mental effort for his team to spring
the upset.
Every time the 7-foot-1 Mike Tis-
dale casually reached over a Wol-
verine defender to snatch a pass out
of the air and put it in the basket,
you were reminded that thiswas
perhaps the worst possible matchup
for Michigan in conference play.
Beilein's team thrives on hitting
3-pointers - those are a lot harder
to convert when players like junior
guards Stu Douglass and Zack
Novak find opponents as many as
five-to-six inches taller than them
leaping out to contest their shots.
The Wolverines live on Morris
and otherball-handlerspenetrat-
ing the lane and puttingup tough
layups - when you have to wait

until you've almost fallento the
court again on your shot attempt
just to getseparation, those aren't
goingto fall with anyregularity.
Heck, even No.2 Ohio State
is abettermatchupforthisteam
- Jared Sullinger is one of the
best players in the country, but at
least Jordan Morgan can lookhim
straight inthe eye when trying to
deny him in the post, instead of
staringup at someone like Tisdale,
helpless to do anything once the ball
reaches his hands.
So while Michigan iswell past
the point oftakingsolace in playing
hard and just being able to compete
with teams better than it, the Wol-
verines needn't worry about this
one too much.
Instead, they should be worrying
about that road finale at Minnesota
next week. The Fighting Illini and
the Golden Gophers are very similar
teams in terms of issues their sizes
propose.
But Michigan knows it can beat
Minnesota - itlost by just four
pointsin the teams' previous meet-
ing this season, and it topped the
Gophers the last four times before
that (meanwhile, the Wolverines'
haven't won atAssembly Hall for 16
years).
Looking at Michigan's final five
games going into Wednesday night,
it appeared it had to win three to
give it asolid shotof makingthe
NCAA Tournament.
Just four games are left, but the
fact remains the same - the Wol-
verines need three wins, and their
best opportunities for nabbing them
are still out there on the schedule.
Thiswin would have helped
immensely, which is why much will
be made of the last possession, when
Beilein's squad nearly made two
desperation shots to win the game.
"I was looking just to get (the
last shot) oft," Beilein said. "I don't
know (what would've happened) if
(Douglass) would've had just a little
bit more time to set his feet. That
would have been a great way for
Michigan to win in Champaign."
It would have been - but a win in
Iowa City is just as important at this
point. So,too, are potential victories
over Wisconsin, Minnesotaand
Michigan State.
The Wolverines' Big Dance
hopes suffered a blow Wednesday
in Champaign. But after losing to a
eam that, realistically, itshould've
lost to, Michigan is far from dead.
The tightrope, though, just got a
little shakier.

Even though there are

coach John Beilein and his
crew are still determined to

'THE RUM DIARY' (1998), HUNTER S. THOMPSON

MADRAS MASALA
328 Maynard
The best thing to be said about Madras
Masala's chicken tikka masala is that the
spice levels are actually accurate. Mild
takes it easy, medium has a little kick and
spicy might make you reach for the water
- but at least you know what you signed
up for. Most importantly, the flavor isn't
compromised. The Madras chicken tikka
masala is always a solid choice for any
lunch or dinner.
TASTE OF INDIA
217South State
It's impossible to be satisfied with just a
taste of the chicken tikka masala at Taste
of India. With its rich sauce and spicy
aroma, you'll want multiple plates of this
masterpiece. Its components make a culi-
nary dreamteam, as the powerful flavor of
the chicken is balanced with the lightness
of the basmati rice. It's enough to make
you want to brave the State Street traffic
and its $10.95 price tag.

SHALIMAR
307 South Main
Known for high standards, Shalimar
follows through with a quality - if pricey
- chicken tikka masala. While the creamy
curry sauce is a bit too mild, it blends well
with a generous helping of rice and peas.
Slices of onion and tomato help to compli-
ment healthy chunks of marinated chick-,
en. Order with buttery naan on the side
and a thick and tangy sweet lassi, and the
meal is more than enough for one person.
RAJA RANI
400 South Division
Raja Rani's chicken tikka masala is
unquestionably delicious - unfortunate-
ly its sauce, slightly runny and drenched
with a monsoon of cilantro and onions,
keeps the dish from making you want to
break out in choreographed dance. But
Indian entrees are never meant to be
eaten alone, and it gains points back for its
worship-worthy Peshwari naans and boss
basmati rice.

Gonzo prince's 'Diary'

By STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
Deputy Magazine Editor
Long before the late, legendary
journalist Hunter S. Thompson
loudly crashed into mainstream
culture (be it as a pop culture
appropriation - most memorably,
Johnny Depp as Thompson dop-
pelganger Raoul Duke in Terry
Gilliam's 1998 cinematic bender
and dorm room poster fodder,
"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"
- or as the actual talented scribe
that he was, vis-a-vis his break-
through book, "Hell's Angels")
there was Thompson as the strug-
gling artist. Such is the glimpse of
the Gonzo king to which readers
are treated in his electric 1998
novel, "The Rum Diary."
Thompson writes as the
30-years-old-but-already-weath
ered journeyman journalist Paul
Kemp, who's seeking a reinven-
tion with a struggling English
daily newspaper in late-'50s San
Juan, Puerto Rico. However,
Kemp's retreat to the Caribbean
plays less like a Carnival cruise
than it does an Orwellian treat-
ment of Eden, as he roughs the

newspaper's precarious financial
situation (sound familiar?) and an
awkward cultural assimilation.
Complementing Kemp is a
colorful cast of characters -
including a crotchety staff pho-
tographer-turned-best bud and
an alluring-but-taken blonde -
who, when sprinkled with a pinch
of the typical Thompson tidings
of paranoia, romanticism and lust,
only exacerbate Kemp's central
hangover - namely, are his best
years behind him?
"The Rum Diary" is visibly
more reserved than subsequent
Thompson works (perhaps most
notable is the absence of drug use,
though, as the title implies, rum is
never more than an arm's reach
away). As expected, Thompson's
vulgar, tough tongue is on high
alert, edifying hilarious and dis-
turbing character portraits of the
island's oddballs. Nevertheless,
the no-holds, barrels-blazing pace
is considerably slowed for a much
more deliberate and calculated
narrative, affording an emotion-
ally organic experience - not one
of stomach-souring viscera.
Disappointments abound for
any reader expecting "The Rum
Diary" to be an earlier chapter
of or an epilogue to. "Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas" - argu-
ably Thompson's most famous
work. Not only do the pistons
fire more violently in his Las
Vegas episode, but it's much
more complex and thematically
deeper: In Sin City, Thompson
presents a political, social and
cultural commentary - broadly,
the disillusionment of '60s coun-
terculture - that is absent here
in the Caribbean. Sure, there are
themes of leftist marginaliza-
tion and capitalist boom on the
island, but such undertones are,
for the most part, merely white
noise. It's also s'tartling that a
young Thompson would articu-
late the concerns of the notably
older Kemp - perhaps revealing
a bothered mind that even Chris-
topher Nolan and co. couldn't
incept.
Though less elaborate, "The
Rum Diary" has a universal yet
intimate pulse that connects to

its reader. The institution under
attack in this work is less tan-
gible - the human spirit. Kemp
is constantly dogged by his age
- at 30, as Thompson writes, "no
longer young but not quite over
the hump." It's Kemp's internal
struggle, not his interaction with
the external world, that proves
most enlightening, as it indicates
a fear to which all can relate - am
I approaching the hill, or did I just
walk down it? It is this struggle
that most pertains to the col-
lege intelligentsia, considering
an individual's true worth and
vulnerability will be fully test-
ed outside the less friendly and
guarded campus confines. Sim-,
ply put, the proverbial real world
by which Kemp feels polarized is
that toward which we all inevita-
bly inch.
Yo ho ho and a
bottle of rum -
or a book of it.
To best value "The Rum Diary"
is to learn its splintered history.
The 1998 publication date is par-
tially misleading, as Thompson
began the book during his brief
Puerto Rico stint in 1960 when he
toiled at a doomed sports publica-
tion and freelanced, as detailed in
Douglas Brinkley's superbly edit-
ed collection of Thompson letters,
"The Proud Highway." Corre-
spondences between 1960 and
1967 reveal a young Thompson
lamenting the numerous rejec-
tions and rewrites of "The Rum
Diary" - confidently self-billed as
the "Great Puerto Rican Novel."
And, in a much later television
interview with Charlie Rose -
YouTube it - Thompson simply
suggests that time constraints
delayed the novel's completion.
That Thompson nursed "The
Rum Diary" for so long - what
else is to be expected of the noto-
riously deadline-averse writer?
- only sweetens the read. Wine
ages well. So does rum.

A look at love
through poetry

Healing with humanities
How the University's Gifts of Art program
ties the rational with the emotional
By Jennifer Xu I Senior Arts Editor

You can tell Valentine's
Day is over because you
can watch TV again
without feeling guilty, depressed
or outraged. The woman
frightened
of thunder-
storms until
her beloved
presents her
with a Love's
Embrace
necklace is
gone - at DAVID
least until LUCAS
Christmas.
So is the Ver-
mont Teddy Bear delivery man
who should not, under any cir-
cumstances, be given your street
address.
We don't recognize the ver-
sion of love these commercials
offer, with their platitudes and
perfection. We worry that we
should, but love is more difficult
than a 30-second TV spot. Love,
as Leonard Cohen said, is not a
victory march. It does not con-
quer all, it is not all you need and
it does not go to Jared.
This is where poetry comes
in. Maybe I'm just as Pollyanna-
ish about poetry as the "Every
Kiss Begins with Kay" folks
are about love, but I do believe
poetry - when it's working at
its best - is an act of love for the
world, no matter how dismal its
vision. In this way, all poetry is
love poetry.
But we're talking about Val-
entine's Day love - two people
clinking wine glasses or walking
hand in hand or maybe even hav-
ing sex. Poetry tells us about that
kind of love too, but it should
free us from the illusion of love-
as-advertised. It should help us
understand the phenomenon as
we know it - the most chaotic,
unnerving, addictive experience
in our lives. Poetry should get it.
'-They Flee From Me," by the
Renaissance poet and diplomat
Thomas Wyatt, is the sort of
poem I mean. It's a poem about
the way love and loss get tangled
and, incidentally, it features the
best sex scene I know of in Eng-
lish poetry.
Wyatt imagines the woman
who no longer loves him as a
wild animal shying from his
open hand: "I have seen them
gentle, tame and meek / That
now are wild and do not remem-
ber / That sometime they putt
themself in danger /To take
bread at my hand." And, like
any heartbroken lover, Wyatt
tortures himself with memories
of they way they were, "once in
special."
When her loose gown from her
shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her arms
long and small;
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
And softly said, "Dear heart,
how like you this?"
That internal rhyme of"she
me" is almost unbearable, as
Wyatt wrenches the syntax to
bring together two pronouns,
even though the people they refer
to are now irrevocably apart. In
his vision, she is the wandering
animal, yet it's she who catches
him in her arms "long and small."
"It was no dream," he admits: "I
lay broad waking." It pains him to

remember, but less than it pains
him not to remember - as this
memory, however cruel, is now
all he has of her.
As much as poets are occu-
pied by the disappointments
of love lost, they also address

the disappointments of love
realized, which can be worse.
In one of my favorite passages
about erotic love, Adrienne Rich
writes: "How many men have
touched me with their eyes
/ more hotly than they later
touched me with their lips." The
contradictions of desire and
fulfillment and disappointment
that we spend our lives trying
to understand, Rich distills into
two devastating lines. Take a
look at Rich's "Twenty-One
Love Poems" for some of the
best contemporary love poetry
you'll find.
Or take the ending of Philip
Larkin's "Talking in Bed," an act
that "ought to be easiest." But
time passes and hearts change,
and even
At this unique distance from
isolation
It becomes still more difficult
to find
Words at once true and kind,
Or not untrue and not unkind.
The gap between true and not
untrue, kind and not unkind,
is barely wide enough for light
to escape. But that's the space
where poetry does its best work.
In Rich's and Larkin's poems,
time ravages fulfilled relation-
ships as those relationships
break down. The heartbreaking
end of Rita Dove's "Old Folk's
Home, Jerusalem" portrays
time's cruelties to even the
strongest relationships. After a
catalogue of old age's depriva-
tions ("what doesn't end sloshes
over"), Dove concludes: "Every-
one waiting here was once in
love."
Content NSFW
... unless you
are a poet*
"Death is the mother of
beauty," Wallace Stevens tells
us. In this case he means that
the beauty of a love poem, of love
itself, is tied up in its potential
to be lost. Poetry is a politicking
with loss, which in love poetry
means depicting the supreme
overthrow of our rational selves
that occurs when we fall in love.
And ultimately, love poetry
presents love as our one consol-
ing defense against the inevi-
tability of death. Take Eavan
Boland's "Quarantine," a poem
set amid the Irish potato fam-
ine, "in the worst hour of the
worst season / of the worst year
of a whole people." A man and
woman die of hunger and cold,
and are discovered later with
"her feet ... held against his
breastbone. / The last heat of his
flesh was his last gift to her."
This is not material for TV
commercials or, for that matter,
for much love poetry, with its
"praise of the easy graces and
sensuality of the body." Boland
offers only "this merciless inven-
tory," of "what they suffered.
How they lived. / And what
there is between a man and a
woman. /And in what darkness
it can best be proved."
The joy and fear of that last
line is something I've found

nowhere else but in poetry and
in love.

In her landmark book "Homo
Aestheticus," anthropologist
Ellen Dissanayake addresses the
classic issue of culture versus
biology: Why do people make
art? Why do they respond to art
in the way they do? Aestheticism,
she says, is our way of bracketing
things off as a way to cope with
life's more unexpected events -
whether marriage, birth, death
or war. It is not a parenthetical
luxury that can be dispensed
with whenever we don't have the
time or resources to produce it -
it's intrinsic to our very beings, a
mechanism for survival.
"Having worked at the hospi-
tal for 21 years, I do think art is
a basic, primal, human response,"
said Elaine Sims, the director of
the University Health System's
Gifts of Art program. "People's
response to aesthetic or sound -
in primitive times, it was proba-
blyyour mother's voice, or sounds
that meant things were safe, or
visual things that meant, 'This is
my clan or family' -I think these
things are kind of hot-wired in."
In a hospital setting, lives and
responses become irrevocably
altered. This is where Gifts of
Art enters the picture. Through a
series of traveling exhibits, musi-
cal performances and healing
gardens, the program uses art
to recenter patients from the ill-
nesses that comes to define them,
to bringthem back into the fold of
humanity.
"When you're in a hospital,
you're up in a space pod in outer
space," Sims said. "I mean, your
whole world slips away from you.
It's just you and that scary, scary
reason why you're in the hospital.
And your whole world shrinks to
that."
Sims added: "(Art) really sig-
nals all those things about self
identity - being human and being
there versus, 'It's my illness, I
haveno control.'Itkeeps bring-
ing you into the moment, bringing
you back where you need to be, to
get through what you have to get
through."
Gifts of Art originally began at
the University as an offshoot of
a University of Iowa program in
1987. Sims stepped up to the role of
director three years later and has
been championing the field ever
since. Today, the program has 54
rotating exhibits that are viewed
by over 10,000 people a day and
encompass all sensory mediums
- visual, auditory and tactile.
Studies have shown that
patients respond more favorably
to nature scenes, baby animals
and French impressionists, so
these types of art are often shown.
For individual rooms, volunteers
also wheel around an Art Cart,
a lending library that provides
framed artwork for patients - its

number now totals 1,000 for the
900-bed hospital.
"Patients become very, very
attached to the art, sometimes in
a magical or mystical way," Sims
said. "If they had a good result,
somehow it had to do with this
picture - or this picture pleased
them, or helped them through a
dark time."
Studies have shown patients
who are exposed to art are calmer
- they have lower blood pressure,
need less pain medication and
require a shorter stay at the hos-
pital. That's not to say, however,
that any abstract, color-splattered
Jackson Pollock painting or red,
severed hand sculpture will be
able to hasten the healing process.
If a patient is sick on a hospital
bed, mind addled by medication
or the stress of the situation, he or
she needs to be comforted.
"For people in the hospital, it's
not a time to be challenged, it's not
a time for ambiguity - your mind
doesn't have the energy to work
at anything," Sims said. "Things
that are like comfort food, that are
familiar, that take you back when
you were young and protected are
the best kinds of art."
Music, in particular, causes
cells to release substances like
endorphins, which are the same
pleasure-producing chemicals
that give us runner's highs, and
immunoglobulins, which help to
fight disease.
In this vein of thinking, Sims
has recently been looking to
expand Gifts of Art within the
auditory spectrum. The Life
Sciences Orchestra, which was
founded in 2000, is composed
entirely of caregivers, staff and
science students and presents
two free concerts to the pub-
lic each year. Last month, the
orchestra performed Mahler's
"Resurrection" symphony at
Hill Auditorium to an audience
of thousands. During the sum-
mer, some musicians from the
orchestra play in smaller cham-
ber groups in the hospital's
courtyard for patients to enjoy.
But Sims's personal favor-
ite is the Bedside Music Pro-
gram, a 70-hour-a-week outfit
that provides musical therapy
at the bedside of a sick patient.
Currently, there are three full-
time music practitioners who
perform a variety of songs on
guitar, voice and viola. The pro-
gram is particularly popular in
the intensive care units - dur-
ing a particularly harrowing ill-
ness or at the end of life.
"That's so immediate, so
intimate," Sims said. "It's right
there in the moment where peo-
ple really need it."
Art for healing's sake is part
of a larger, country-wide move-
ment known as integrative

medicine - a practice that empha-
sizes the doctor-patient relation-
ship and pays attention to the
entire mind, body and spirit of the
person rather than just the affect-
ed parts. Incorporated in this are
alternative methods that utilize a
number of therapies across disci-
plines in order to support optimal
health and healing, among them
acupuncture, herbal supplements,
yoga, mind-body imagery and
preventative medicine.
Dr. Sara Warber, the direc-
tor and founder of the University
Integrative Medicine Program,
studied herbalism and spiritual
healing for 14 years during her
fellowship under the direction of
a local Native American healer.
Warber was clear to distinguish
integrative medicine as supple-

mentary to conventional medi-
cine, rather than alternative.
"It's actually combined with
conventional care and is pur-
posefully selected by physicians
who are trained to know what to
select," she said.
In order to foster this closer
personal relationship, integrative
physicians tryto get to know their
patients better initially, focusing
a larger amount of time on pre-
ventative healing and by offer-
ing longer visits. In their clinics,
they strive to promote a healthier
hospital environment, providing
patients with softer lighting and
more ergonomic furniture.
Research in this field tends
to pay more attention to daily
environmental effects on human

health rather than the more
cell-level concerns of biochem-
istry or molecular biology. For
instance, the University of
Michigan Health System is cur-
rently involved in research on
whether eating tart cherries on
a daily basis will have effects
on patients' lipid levels and how
performing acupressure might
affect fatigue. Elsewhere, inte-
grative scientists are investigat-
ing the capacity of paintings to
heal or guided imagery to relieve
pain.
On the aesthetics spectrum,
too, the University has been mak-
ing strides to incorporate holistic
healing into its curriculum. For
the past four years, Art & Design
Prof. Anne Mondro has been
teaching a studio art class called
"Retaining Identity: The Role of
Creative Work in a Healthcare
Setting" that combines imagina-
tion with a healingsurface.
"The philosophy of the class
is to look at the benefits or to
examine the role of creativity -
the potential of art to really aid
the human spirit," Mondro said.
"Creativity is so beneficial to our
life and it enables us to express
ourselves ... to give us a chance to
get into our own world."
This semester, the class is
working with the University
Geriatric Center's Silver Club
Program, a day club composed
of elderly patients with moder-
ate to advanced dementia, Over
a 10-week period, students will
facilitate a series of art workshops
for the members, eventually cre-
ating a collaborative work of art
infused with lessons they learned
from their elderly partners.
Mondro's own art stems from
her interest in portraying the
human body accurately. In her
graduate studies, she became
interested in how illness affects
a community ofpeople, while her
grandfather was struggling with
cancer.

"A lot of my work is based on
human experiences - my times
of struggles with my own body
and family illnesses," she said.
"And thathas kind of led to work-
ing with the community."
Five years ago, Mondro, along-
side her students and artist Katy
Bergman Cassell, fashioned a
brilliant triptych mural entitled
"The Dragon of Wishes, Hopes
and Dreams" for the University
Gifts of Art program. The mural
still sits in the University Hos-
pital's Taubman Center lobby
today. Across from the hallowed
faces of the University Hospi-
tal directors the dragon regally
stands, its fanned, Italian paper
scales saturated with mica-
flecked blues, golds, greens and
reds. Every one of dragon's 1,700
shining scales has been drawn,
colored and cut by the hospital's
patients, caregivers and staff -
from the head of the hospital to
the youngest bedside patient.
"My vision was that we
(would) have something that was
kind of imbued with power and
magic but not necessarily vis-
ible," Sims said.
Science initially entered this
world as something more akin
to philosophy. Bohr conceived
his quantum model of the atom
while studying cubist paintings.
Pythagoras found that the most
consonant musical intervals
were the ones with smaller math-
ematical ratios. As it has become
embedded in the University's
Medical School curriculum, Art
& Design classes and hospital
programs, the healing arts return
the scientific field back to its
original humanistic setting - an
intersection between the rational
and sensual that proves the two
aren't in conflict after all.
"I always have this mantra
when it comes to explaining art
in a hospital: Art always as a
job to do, it can't just sit on the
wall looking pretty," Sims said.
"Really, it's like a workhorse. It
has to stand the test of time; it
has to engage people; it has to
grab you."

ATHLETICS
From Page 1B
or musician, practices are fun-
damental for the skaters, since
constant repetition ensures
perfection on the ice when per-
forming.
"The more hours you practice,
the better you're going to be,"
Fiscus said. "I think it's even
more so than with other sports,
because I used to play soccer.
"You practice different plays,
but each game is different: you
can't anticipate how a team is
going to play against you. With
skating, you are in control of
what happens out there - it's
the same program, no matter
what."
Repetitive practice is essential
to synchronized skating, since
special attention is also given
to minute details the audience
might not notice. For instance, at
one point in the program, every
single one of the skaters winks at
the exact same time.
"It's not just making it look
effortless, but it's making every-
body look effortless at the same
time doing the exact same thing
in the exact same way," Fiscus
said. "It's about being so repeti-
tive that you could literally be
half asleep and be doing it won-
derfully."
Especially for synchro-
nized skating, team trust is key
because the skaters only have
one chance to shine and show
their hard work.
"You don't have control
over what happens in a perfor-
mance," Kaufman-Ross said.
"You can only control what you
do and everything else is left to
the other girls that are skating.
You have to trust them enough
to know that they are going to do
what they are there to do."
To ensure this unification, the
team also practices off the ice to
focus on the nitpicky details of
the program or routine they're
working on - the facial expres-
sions, hand directions and other

body mannerisms.
An important quality Fiscus
finds essential to succeeding is
lack of fear.
"It's a lot about being really
good at not letting things get to
you. Not being afraid to embar-
rass yourself," she said. "You
have to be able to throw your-
self into a'character and not be
embarrassed because you might
look dumb."
During one of the practices,
Fiscus and her teammates were
rehearsingshimmying and shak-
ing their skirts - a move in the
program - in the Yost arena
lobby. The hockey players could
have arrived at any moment, but
that didn't stop the skaters from
repeating that section over and
over again.
Freestyle skating has its own
technical difficulties, mostly
stemming from the jumps and
spins the skaters are permitted
to do. Physical conditioning is
even more important for free-
stylers, because the turns and
jumps need to appear flawless
from the moment they take off
to the moment they land back on
the ice.
"It's more complete freedom,"
said LSA senior Chelsea Lind-
blad, the figure skating club vice
president. "It's artistic expres-
sion, and you have your own
freedom to do whatever you
want ... you don't have to match
everyone."
Pool ofhard Knox
Hours before a competition,
synchronized swimmers spend
a good 90 minutes "Knoxing"
their hair. The process involves
each swimmer's hair being
slicked back in a tight bun and
coated and recoated with rough-
ly three packs of Knox unfla-
vored gelatin per person. After
half an hour, the Knox hardens
and the hair is as solid as a hel-
