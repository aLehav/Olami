Around 
two 
hundred 
people gathered in Weiser 
Hall Wednesday night to 
hear Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, 
former United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human 
Rights, speak on the world’s 
greatest challenges to human 
rights. 
Sociology 
Professor 
Kiyoteru Tsutsui, director 
of 
the 
Donia 
Human 
Rights 
Center, 
said 
the 
Distinguished Lecture series 
invites speakers to campus 
who have both experience in 
human rights and the ability 

to speak broadly about the 
topic. Al Hussein’s record 
fighting for human rights 
globally, Tsutsui said, make 
him an ideal lecturer. 
“I can’t think of anybody 
who is a better spokesperson 
for 
human 
rights 
than 
the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human 
Rights,” Tsutsui said. 
Al 
Hussein 
began 
his 
lecture by defining universal 
human rights but quickly 
turned to criticize academics 
and universities for not doing 
enough to protect them. 
“On the face of it, you would 
have to believe that (human 
rights) are a weak force,” Al 

Hussein said. “The mere fact 
that most universities don’t 
have human rights centers, 
and if they have human 
rights 
centers, 
they 
are 
small, usually underfunded, 
usually lodged in a law 
faculty, and even there, they 
struggle to find a position 
of prominence … Voldemort 
would be so proud.” 
Al 
Hussein 
identified 
nine 
main 
threats 
to 
human rights today: China, 
Russia, the United States 
under 
President 
Trump, 
authoritarian-minded 
leaders around the world, 
white 
supremacists, 
conservatives, 
leading 

academics who attack the 
human rights agenda without 
proposing alternatives and 
economic elites. 
He argued as each of these 
actors work to erode the 
global infrastructure built 
to protect human rights, 
codifying protections into 
law is more important than 
ever. Al Hussein illustrated 
this point with the story 
of René Cassin, one of the 
original 
drafters 
of 
the 
Universal 
Declaration 
of 
Human Rights, who fought 
in World War I and lost over 
a dozen family members in 
the Holocaust.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Alvin Bowles, Facebook’s vice 
president of global publisher 
sales and operations, shared 
aspects of his life that have 
been crucial to his career, as 
well as recent controversies 
surrounding Facebook at talk 
Wednesday evening. 
About 350 people attended 
the talk, which was part of 
the Yaffe Speaker Series led 
by Marketing lecturer Marcus 
Collins at the Ross School of 

Business. The series showcases 
individuals in business who are 
restructuring their fields. 
At the event, Bowles discussed 
many of the factors that lead 
him to where he is today, such 
as a strong community. Growing 
up in Detroit, he relied heavily 
on his family’s community ties 
and cultivated his own. As a 
student at the University of 
Michigan, he said he found an 
intricate web of support from 
students and alums that he still 
uses today. After graduating, he 
went on to work for JP Morgan 

& Chase, Sony, Time Warner 
and eventually Facebook. 
Bowles said a strong sense of 
community in Ann Arbor helped 
him get out of his comfort zone 
and achieve his goals. He said 
it was difficult relocating from 
Michigan to New York City, but 
he was able to stay in New York 
because of the connections he 
built with alumni who helped 
him feel confident in his own 
abilities. 
“I learned a valuable lesson: 
Comfort 
zones 
don’t 
make 
your life safe, they make your 

life small,” Bowles said. “For 
me, New York was a foreign 
place… I didn’t have any friends 
and I didn’t know anybody 
but I leaned on my Michigan 
community, to be able to give me 
a sense of … family.”
LSA 
freshman 
Dilpreet 
Kaur told The Daily she was 
motivated by Bowles’ story 
because his path unfolded over 
time, rather than following a 
predetermined track. 

Liberty in North Korea, 
a 
student 
organization 
at 
the University of Michigan,, 
invited two North Korean 
refugees 
to 
share 
their 
journeys 
to 
freedom 
on 
Wednesday evening at Angell 
Hall 
to 
about 
75 
people. 
Jeongyol Ri and Ilhyeok Kim 
are representatives of LiNK 
headquarters in Long Beach, 
Calif., 
where 
they 
share 
their stories with audience 
members. 
Ri is now a current student 
studying mathematics at Seoul 
National University, and Kim 
is studying political science 
and diplomacy and Hankuk 
University of Foreign Studies 
in South Korea. LiNK is a non-
profit organization that aims 
to aid North Korean refugees 
in their journey to freedom. 
They have helped over 1000 
North 
Korean 
refugees 
who have made the three-
thousand-mile rescue route 
to Southeast Asia to freedom 
and safety. The organization 
also hopes to redefine public 
perception of North Korea by 
shifting the narrative from the 
politics to the people.

For The Daily 

At midnight on Nov. 1, 2019, 
the application for recreational 
marijuana licenses opened to 
Michigan businesses across 
the 
state. 
The 
Michigan 
Marijuana Regulatory Agency, 
part of the Michigan State 
Department of Licensing and 
Regulatory 
Affairs, 
began 
accepting these applications 
as part of their efforts to 
implement 
new 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
recreational 
use in the industry. 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
own 
Exclusive Brands, currently 
an 
operational 
medical 
marijuana facility, was the 
first business to apply for 
the licence. Narmin Jarrous, 
executive vice president of 
business 
development 
at 
Exclusive Brands, explained 
they were well prepared to 
capitalize on the opportunity. 
“We had a pre-qualification 
approval before we woke up on 
Friday morning, we submitted 
our 
pre-qualification 
application at 12:17 a.m., and 
we were the first approval 
later that morning,” Jarrous 
said. 
Omar Hishmeh, owner of 
Exclusive Brands, said he 

and his company prioritize 
being first to implement new 
developments in the industry.
“It’s always been a priority 
of ours to be the first at about 
anything in the industry,” 
Hishmeh 
said. 
“Anytime 
any new emergency rules 
or anything comes out, we 
adapt 
to 
them; 
any 
new 
opportunities, 
we 
actively 
start to pursue them as soon 
as possible. Basically, just 
staying on top of everything 
we can to remain a leading 
company in the marketplace 
here in Michigan.” 
Exclusive Brands has its 
flagship 
location 
in 
Ann 
Arbor and currently services 
patients with a diverse array of 
medical marijuana products. 
Jarrous explained the current 
scope of the business and 
their approach to managing 
production locally. 
“Exclusive 
Brands 
is 
currently operational as a 
medical 
marijuana 
facility, 
so 
we 
were 
one 
of 
the 
first 
vertically 
integrated 
marijuana facilities in the 
state, so we have a grow, 
process 
and 
provisioning 
center in Ann Arbor,” Jarrous 
said.

The University of Michigan’s 
Theme Semester for Winter 2020 
will center around the Great 
Lakes. Sponsored by the School of 
Literature, Science and the Arts, 
the Great Lakes Theme Semester 
will feature classes and events 
focused on issues dealing with the 
Great Lakes region. 
English 
Department 
Chair 
David Porter, who serves as the 
Great Lakes Theme Semester 
Steering Committee director, said 
the committee hopes the theme 
semester 
will 
promote 
wide-
ranging conversations about the 
history of the Great Lakes and how 
it has impacted the environment, 
culture and politics of the region 
the University calls home.

“The 
Great 
Lakes 
Theme 
Semester will create a space for 
conversation on campus about the 
region we live in,” Porter said. “LSA 
traditionally has a global focus, and 
not as much attention has been paid 
to the specific region (where the 
University is located).”
LSA senior Leo Chumack, a 
Program 
in 
the 
Environment 
major, said he thinks the Great 
Lakes 
Theme 
Semester 
will 
help students and faculty at the 
University pay more attention 
to the region. Chumack said he 
believes it is important for humans 
to protect the environment, noting 
the impact of climate change 
will be particularly significant in 
Michigan.
“As climate change exacerbates, 
(the Great Lakes) are going to be 
an even more valuable assets than 

they already are,” Chumack said. 
“We’re going to be running out of 
fresh water, and if it’s not me who’s 
not going to have access to this 
water, it’s the next generation that 
will be unable to thrive due to the 
elimination of this really precious 
natural resource.”
During 
the 
Winter 
2020 
semester, 54 courses will be 
offered pertaining to the Great 
Lakes Theme Semester. These 
courses will be featured in multiple 
departments within LSA as well 
as across the Ford School of Public 
Policy, College of Engineering, 
 
School for Environment, Taubman 
and at the University’s Biological 
Station. 
In addition to courses, other 
events such as guest lecturers, films 
and exhibits will be brought to 
campus. Multiple partners outside 
of the University plan to 
collaborate on projects related 
to the Great Lakes throughout 
the course of the semester. 
Jen 
Read, 
University 
Water Center director, is 
a member of the Steering 
Committee and is working 
to create curricula centered 
around the Great Lakes. Read 
co-teaches a master’s level 
course primarily focused on 
environmental case studies, 
which she said she plans to 
share with other professors 
who would like to implement 
them in their syllabi. Read also 
said her and her colleagues 
are planning a panel series 
that will bring in guests to talk 
about different topics related 
to the Great Lakes.
In learning about the Great 
Lakes through these classes 
and events, Read said she 
hopes students may consider 
a career path geared towards 
protecting the region.
“Everything from that level 
of appreciation all the way up 
to potentially getting students 
excited enough about the 

Great Lakes to seek out job 
opportunities, we really are looking 
for our next generation of leaders, 
and Michigan is the best place to 
generate that from,” Read said.
The 
Great 
Lakes 
Theme 
Semester will also incorporate 
organizations from outside the 
University like Great Lakes Now, 
a news outlet focused on the Great 
Lakes. Great Lakes Now Program 
Director Sandra Svoboda said 
her organization plans to become 
involved with the Great Lakes 
Theme Semester and is currently 
in discussion about what their 
involvement will look like. 
Like Read, Svoboda said she 
is excited the University is using 
the Theme Semester to highlight 
opportunities the Great Lakes 
bring to the region.
“This really offers an infinite 
number of ways … that U of M, with 
this theme semester, can further an 
organization, use their resources 
and network to have really dynamic 
events and opportunities in Ann 
Arbor and beyond next semester,” 
Svoboda said.
Joel Stone, senior curator for the 
Detroit Historical Society, said the 
Theme Semester is an important 
way for the University to educate 
students on the Great Lakes.
“The (Great Lakes) resources are 
so important to who we have been, 
who we are and hopefully who 
we’re going to be in the future,” 
Stone said. “Everybody who lives in 
this area or everybody who lives in 
the country should understand how 
important these resources are.”
Although the role the Detroit 
Historical Society will play in the 
Theme Semester has not been 
entirely defined, Stone said the 
organization hopes to bring in an 
intern from the University to work 
with the collection as well as host 
lectures or symposia at the Dossin 
Great Lakes Museum in Detroit.

“So, we kind of do everything 
in house.” 
Businesses with recreational 
marijuana licenses will be able 
to tap into a whole new market 
of users. Jarrous explained the 
potential impact recreational 
licensing could have on the 
accessibility of the drug. 
“One of the biggest criticisms 
of the industry is that it’s been 
inaccessible to people for a 
really long time, and it’s easier 
to get clean tested marijuana 
if you’re wealthy, or if you’re 
better connected, or if you’re 
living in certain areas, and 
for a long time it’s been really 
unfair,” Jarrous said. 
Laurence 
Horowitz, 
 
a 
senior kinesiology student and 
president of Green Wolverine 
— an organization for students 
interested in business and 
dedicated 
to 
educating 
people about cannabis and 
the marijuana industry — 
discussed the potential effects 
of licensing on recreational 
usage. 
“I don’t think usage of the 
drug will increase or decrease 
with regards to the opening 
of 
these 
dispensaries 
for 
recreational use. It’s just going 
to be a matter of where the 
people who do use it go to get 
it,” Horowitz said. 
Horowitz said he believes 
the 
availability 
of 
legal 
recreational marijuana will 
affect product quality and 
consumer reception. 
“I think with regards to 
price, accessibility and stigma 
that’s going to be very good 

for the consumer. People are 
going to be very happy about 
that,” Horowitz said. “With 
regards to quality, I don’t know 
how happy you’re going to see 
consumers, just because you’ve 
seen the quality of cannabis 
really dip in states that have 
recreational versus medical.” 
Jarrous 
also 
explained 
the process of working with 
local and state government to 
abide by regulations, and the 
expectations of the city, as 
well as the impact local culture 
has had on their business 
development. 
“We work with the local 
government to make sure that 
everything we’re doing has 
the most minimal impact on 
the residents of Ann Arbor, on 
the people surrounding us,” 
Jarrous said. “I think having 
such 
an 
open 
community 
and people who have been so 
accepting of it really catapulted 
us — really helped us out a lot.”
Jarrous 
explained 
that 
since the original applications 
were cleared by the Marijuana 
Regulatory Agency within 24 
hours of submission, they are 
waiting to begin the facility 
inspection 
phase 
of 
the 
licensing process.
“We’re just eagerly waiting 
for them to come out and do 
their inspection, and then, 
theoretically, 
we 
can 
be 
awarded our license right after 
that, and, if everything goes 
smoothly, 
we’re 
supposed 
to be able to start selling on 
January 1,” Jarrous said.

“He knew the devil of 
violence that slithers through 
all of us, and that is why 
we need law,” Al Hussein 
said. 
“And 
yet 
there 
is 
another factor in play today. 
Because human rights law 
is being trapped in the fault 
line separating competing 
ideologies … a liberal order, 
grounded in positive and 
natural law, and a more 
conservative one, rejecting 
the former’s more recent 
advances.” 
Al Hussein concluded his 
talk with a call to action for 
students. Young people, he 
said, must vote and be leaders 
in fighting for human rights. 

“We 
don’t 
need 
bright 
people,” said Al Hussein. 
“We’re in need of smart 
people 
with 
a 
deep 
conscience. 
Smart 
people 
who are brave, and smart 
people who are willing to 
self-sacrifice 
…We 
need 
people with a deep reservoir 
of ethical thinking and a 
conscience that will make a 
difference.”
LSA junior Lana Charara 
told 
The 
Daily 
she 
was 
inspired by the speaker’s 
work and message. 
“I just really admire the 
work (the speaker) has done 
in the past for human rights 
and his passion for these 
(kinds) of issues,” Charara 
said. 
“I 
was 
just 
really 
excited when I saw that he 
was speaking here.”

its small size. The vehicle 
uses 
12 
cameras, 
radar 
and 
ultrasound 
sensors 
to navigate and look out 
for possible obstructions 
while 
on 
the 
road 
— 
including potholes, trees, 
buildings and poor weather 
conditions.
 Johnson-Roberson said 
because 
of 
challenging 
road 
conditions 
in 
Michigan, Ann Arbor was 
a good place to launch 
an adaptable and safely-
operating robot.
“Ann Arbor is a really 
great location for a couple 
of 
reasons,” 
Johnson-
Roberson 
said. 
“A 
lot 
of 
autonomous 
vehicle 
deployment is happening 
in Arizona and California 
where the weather is the 
same every day and the 
roads 
are 
really 
wide 
and very flat and have no 
potholes, so it’s not terribly 
representative for the rest 
of the United States. Most 
of the United States is not 
like Arizona, and so in that 
way I think this is a great 
place 
to 
deploy 
robots 
because you have to deal 
with a lot of the things that 
other people are just sort 
of avoiding, and I think it’s 
really forcing us to make a 
better robot.”
Johnson-Roberson 
said 
Ann Arbor was also an 
ideal location to launch 
the new autonomous food 
delivery service due to its 
high restaurant density.
“These robots are really 
designed to go between 
a half a mile and two and 
a 
half 
miles— 
 
maybe 
three miles at max and 
so there’s a ton of density 
of 
restaurants 
(in 
this 
range),” Johnson-Roberson 
said. “If you think about 
how many restaurants are 
downtown, we can pick up 
from probably 40 places 
before we even have to go 
more than three or four 

blocks.”
Johnson-Roberson 
said 
he 
hopes 
to 
eventually 
expand the service into 
cities outside of Ann Arbor, 
particularly 
Boston 
and 
other college towns like 
Madison, Wisconsin.
During 
the 
pilot 
program, 
Refraction 
AI 
partnered 
with 
local 
restaurants including Miss 
Kim and Belly Deli. In the 
future, they hope to expand 
to work with restaurants 
all 
across 
campus, 
as 
well as collaborate with 
MDining to open up a 
delivery service on North 
Campus 
and 
execute 
delivery from their dining 
service Fireside Café.
Eric 
Joh, 
co-owner 
and operational manager 
of Belly Deli, said the 
restaurant was excited to 
partner 
with 
Refraction 
AI 
and 
believes 
the 
partnership will generate 
public attention for the 
restaurant.
“We thought it was a neat 
idea, and I think probably 
the future of deliveries will 
be automated,” Joh said. 
“We thought it was pretty 
exciting what they were 
doing at Refraction AI, so 
we wanted to be a part of it. 
I think it’s going to increase 
business by generating a 
lot of publicity; I think it 
generates a lot of public 
interest and it’s something 
very exciting.”
Joh said the cost was one 
of the advantages of this 
service over the traditional 
delivery 
services 
they 
use like Postmates and 
Grubhub.
“If 
cost 
is 
an 
issue, 
people wouldn’t have to tip 
as much for an automated 
service — it would already 
be included in pricing.” 
Joh said. “As of now it is 
a little bit cheaper than 
the other services. The 
commission rate is slightly 
lower 
than 
the 
other 
delivery services we use. If 
they have enough vehicles 
on the road then I think 
most of the companies will 
use it because it’s more 
cost effective, but I think 
that’s way further down 
the road.”
Johnson-Roberson 
has 
spent his career working 
on self-driving cars and 
other robots and said he 
wanted to create a robot 
that regularly interacted 
with humans and improved 
their lives.
“I was disappointed that 
there’s still not a robot that 
touches your life everyday.” 
he said. “You go to school, 
you go home — you don’t 
see a robot. Maybe you 

occasionally see a Waymo 
car 
but 
it’s 
not 
doing 
anything for your life. It’s 
been my career building 
robots, and I want to build 
a robot that you get to see 
and for my neighbors and 
my friends… it makes their 
lives better and it helps to 
improve their day to day 
and interact with them 
regularly.”
LSA 
junior 
Blaine 
Thompson is a frequent 
user 
of 
food 
delivery 
services and says he thinks 
the 
new 
autonomous 
delivery service would be 
useful for Ann Arbor traffic 
and speed of delivery. 
“Most of the time I look 
for the closest restaurants 
to avoid a big delivery fee, 
unless I want something 
from a restaurant on North 
Campus 
or 
something,” 
Thompson said. “I would 
use 
a 
robotic 
service 
like that mostly as just 
another delivery service, 
but having less cars on the 
road is always good for 
the environment and Ann 
Arbor driving. Likewise, 
it seems that it might be 
quicker than traditional 
food delivery services.”
The 
service 
had 
five 
robots during their pilot 
program, and the founders 
of Refraction AI anticipate 
to expand the fleet to 
between 15 and 30 robots 
into the winter and spring. 
Johnson-Roberson listed 
three major factors that 
separate 
this 
compact 
autonomous 
delivery 
service from a traditional 
vehicle and delivery driver: 
safety, environment and 
reliability. 
He 
said 
the 
REV-1 is less dangerous 
than a traditional larger 
vehicle and in the event 
of an accident, customers 
can only expect your food 
to get damaged — not a 
human driver.
“We have the idea that 
if you go slower and make 
something 
that’s 
lighter 
it’s a lot safer… and you 
can do it without having 
to have the same safety 
requirements you would 
have for a bigger vehicle,” 
Johnson-Roberson said. “If 
you don’t have a person in 
it the safety requirements 
are so different because 
if it’s a burrito inside, you 
don’t really care if the 
burrito gets damaged if the 
vehicle gets hit.” 
Each robot costs about 
$4,000 
to 
build 
and 
travels at a steady speed 
of between 10 and 12 miles 
per hour, putting the robot 
at less risk of damage if an 
accident occurs. 
Johnson-Roberson 
said 

another 
benefit 
of 
the 
robot is that it is more 
environmentally conscious 
than a traditional vehicle 
because it is electric and 
does not rely on fossil 
fuels. 
“There’s 
really 
a 
lot 
of 
issues 
around 
sustainability 
for 
using 
cars to do food delivery, 
and so we thought one of 
the big ways that we can 
have a long-term impact is 
moving us away from using 
big fossil fuel-burning cars 
to do delivery when we 
can do it with an electric 
vehicle that’s as light as a 
bike,” 
Johnson-Roberson 
said.
Johnson-Roberson 
also mentioned the robot 
is more reliable than a 
traditional delivery driver, 
due to lack of concerns 
about an employee getting 
sick or having to miss work. 
Additionally, he said the 
robots are serving a market 
need, rather than taking 
away 
jobs 
from 
human 
delivery drivers who do 
not have sustainable jobs.
 “We don’t think about 
that lightly and I think 
it is important to realize 
what the delivery market 
is like,” Johnson-Roberson 
said. “Deliverers don’t get 
health 
insurance, 
they 
don’t have any job stability, 
they’re dependent mostly 
on tips so it’s not a very 
sustainable 
job. 
We 
hope that we’re building 
something that’s a more 
sustainable industry that 
treats its workers more 
fairly and that hopefully 
that humans at the end 
of the day are going to be 
the ones that benefit from 
this.”
He said the tele-operator 
employees 
working 
for 
Refraction AI will receive 
benefits 
food 
delivery 
drivers 
typically 
don’t 
have.
“We’re 
not 
trying 
to 
exploit people to make this 
kind of business work,” 
Johnson-Roberson 
said. 
‘We think that there is a 
way to pay people a fair 
wage to do things like 
remote operation, and we 
can do that in a way where 
they are stable employees — 
they get health insurance; 
they get all the benefits 
that are important. We 
think that this technology, 
and not just this, but many 
of this autonomous driver 
technology 
is 
going 
to 
make big changes in our 
economy, and we would 
like to make sure we do 
that in the most ethical and 
most conscientious way.”

Erwin presented his book “Lead 
Yourself First,” and explained the 
importance of solitude in a world 
oversaturated with distractions. 
He said avoiding distractions is a 
crucial step in becoming a better 
leader. According to Erwin, the 
constant use of technology renders 
the average person perpetually 
stimulated and vulnerable to 
distractions.
“When you look at the data 
the amount of information that 
the average mind processes today 
versus just 30 years ago, it is six 
times more,” Erwin said.
Erwin described social media 
applications as a proponent of the 
“fear of missing out” phenomena, 
which drive people to fill time 
with more hollow technology 
based interactions and an over-
involved social calendar.
“Especially this is relevant for 
undergraduates 
and 
graduate 
students. When you start thinking 
about the role that social media 
has played,” Erwin said. “It is very 
easy to create this anxiety around 
not being there. It is having a great 
impact on how we feel about our 
relationships and how we feel in 
our daily lives.” 
Erwin described how email 
inboxes 
overflowing 
with 
academic and work-related tasks 
push the brain to multitask. Erwin 
explains how multi-tasking, a 
traditionally valued ability in a 
leader, has been proven to decrease 
overall quality of performance by 
50 percent. 
“When 
you 
have 
to 
do 
two things that require your 
conscious effort at the same time, 
your 
performance 
struggles 
significantly,” Erwin said.
According to Erwin, modern 
day leaders face the pressure 

to stay activated in a state of 
productivity 
and 
respond 
to 
every stimulus. Erwin posits the 
modern dilemma for leaders is not 
the inability to find opportunities 
to lead, but to seek moments of 
reflection and to seek solitude. 
“Most 
people 
think 
that 
solitude as a place where you need 
to go out on your own,” Erwin said. 
“What we really did was say that it 
is a psychological state where your 
mind focuses on its own thoughts, 
free of distraction.”
LSA senior Lexi Funk attended 
the event, and agreed with Erwin 
on the importance of solitude, 
telling The Daily it could be 
beneficial in working with other 
people. 
“If you try to apply solitude and 
to find it in your life, it can really 
benefit you so you are in a place 
where you can help others,” Funk 
said.
Erwin urged the audience to 
view integrating solitude into 
one’s life as a process rather than 
an immediate habit for both the 
introverted 
and 
extroverted. 
Erwin cited mindful meditation, 
physical exercise or simply a 
15-minute 
interaction 
cleanse 
during the day as steps toward 
training the mind in solitude and 
focus. 
“If you are someone that 
struggles with this, you cannot 
start with a grandiose goal,” 
Erwin said. “You have to be able 
to train your brain to focus. You 
incrementally grow. It’s going to 
feel uncomfortable.”
Engineering 
junior 
Alan 
Gorbev told The Daily she believes 
these methods are worthwhile, 
especially with the busy schedules 
University students tend to have. 
“With the demanding schedule 
that (University of Michigan 
students) have, we want to spend 
our free time with those we care 
about,” Gorbev said.

Ri was born in Pyongsong, 
North 
Korea, 
where 
he 
developed a passion for math. 
After earning first place in 
a math competition and a 
spot in the North Korean 
International 
Mathematical 
Olympiad Team, Ri made his 
first trip abroad to Colombia 
for a math competition. 
Through 
a 
translator, 
Ri shared how this trip to 
Colombia was his first taste 
of freedom. After travelling 
to South Africa and Thailand 
for more math competitions, 
Ri was able to experience the 
fullness of life outside of the 
North Korean regime. 
After 
being 
offered 
a 
job from the North Korean 
government, Ri decided he 
did not want to work for 
the regime. At his last math 
competition in Hong Kong, Ri 
realized this trip was his last 
opportunity to defect while 
abroad. As a result, Ri snuck 
out at night and sought asylum 
at the South Korean consulate.
“I was so nervous, I felt like 
my heart would burst,” Ri said. 
Ri said his story has given 

him a greater purpose to 
spread awareness of the North 
Korean people.
“I am here because I want 
to work towards the day when 
no other North Korean has to 
give up their family and home 
in order to gain freedom,” Ri 
said.
Next, Kim opened up about 
his own path to freedom. 
In 1995, Kim was born in 
Saetbyeol at a time when a 
devasting famine that affected 
around 2 million people had 
just begun. He explained how 
families who lived on a farm 
were required to give their 
food to the government for 
distribution to the military 
before allocating to the North 
Korean people. As a result, 
Kim’s 
father 
resorted 
to 
stealing grain in order to avoid 
starvation.
Kim’s father was caught by 
the government and sent to a 
re-education center — what 
many have dubbed as hard 
labor camps — for four years. 
“If 
a 
family 
member 
commits a crime against the 
regime, 
the 
entire 
family, 
including children who are not 
even born yet, can be punished 
and ostracized for life,” Kim 

said.
After 
Kim’s 
father 
was 
released from the hard labor 
camp, Kim and his family were 
constantly being watched by 
not only the secret police, but 
also their neighbors, friends 
and community. Eventually, 
Kim and his family made the 
move to escape by wading 
through the river between 
North Korea and China. 
“North 
Korean 
children 
can’t even freely express their 
dreams and spend so much 
energy struggling to survive 
that they don’t even have hope 
for their futures,” Kim said. 
“For me, freedom is when I can 
decide whether I want to do 
something or not. But I had to 
risk my life for that freedom. 
I dream of a day when every 
NK child has the opportunity 
to pursue a life they think is 
worthy of living.”
LSA senior Danielle Kim, 
president of the University’s 
LiNK, 
explained 
as 
a 
three-year 
member 
of 
the 
organization, she has worked 
to 
support 
North 
Korean 
refugees and hopes to share 
their humanizing stories with 
the University of Michigan 
community.

“I 
honestly 
think 
this 
event went above and beyond 
whatever 
expectations 
I 
had,” Kim said. “I am just so 
overwhelmed and so thankful 
for all the people who came 
out to support, and also the 
questions that were asked, 
and thoughtfulness, and also 
the stories … Hearing their 
stories first-hand and live was 
amazing to me.”
Ri and Kim’s stories showed 
a tremendous impact on not 
only Danielle Kim, but also 
the 
audience. 
Throughout 
the event, audience members 
had 
the 
opportunity 
to 
ask 
questions 
and 
share 
comments, and one comment, 
in particular, truly moved 
Danielle Kim.
“I really do think that 
after sharing their stories, 
they were able to change a 
lot of people’s opinions and 
perspectives,” Kim said. “At 
the end, someone made a 
comment that said something 
along the lines of ‘We have the 
utmost respect for you, and 
thank you so much,’ and I was 
just so overwhelmed. I think 
that’s what makes it worth it.”

A major design flaw

‘Tis the season of ignored history

T

here’s 
no 
denying 
that the University of 
Michigan is a top-ranked 
public institution — 
not to mention the 
No.1 public research 
university. With the 
ever-changing political 
climate, social justice 
issues 
and 
global 
events, the curriculum 
requirements 
set 
forth are no longer 
fit to produce a well-
rounded, 
globally 
aware student. From a 
student’s perspective, 
there exists a gap between the 
real-world skills required in 
professional work environments 
in 2019 and the distribution 
requirements set forth by the 
13 undergraduate schools and 
colleges within this institution. 
The majority of U-M freshmen 
matriculate into the College 
of Literature, Sciences and the 
Arts. Currently, the LSA college-
wide requirements include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
seven credits in the humanities, 
a first-year writing requirement, 
an 
upper-level 
writing 
requirement, seven credits in 
the natural sciences, seven in 
the social sciences, seven in 
the humanities, a quantitative 
reasoning 
requirement, 
and 
a single race and ethnicity 
requirement — not to mention 
other 
obligations. 
At 
first 
glance, this is a great spread of 
courses and disciplines with the 
intent to produce well-rounded 
future professionals. However, 
that’s only on paper. From the 
administrative perspective, it’s 
important to re-evaluate how 
these distribution requirements 
inform 
the 
thought 
process 
by which students select their 
courses.
Four years ago, I committed 
to attending the University of 
Michigan in part due to the 
flexible 
degree 
requirements 
that made it possible for me 
to pursue studies in both the 
STEM and humanities fields. 
However, I realized soon after 
matriculating, 
that 
unless 
you are taking the initiative 
to explore a variety of course 
subjects and majors that are not 
specific to the defined major 
courses or the pre-professional 
track you belong to, you are not 
receiving as well-rounded of an 
education as you could be. 
The distribution requirements 
typically 
elicit 
groans 
and 
complaints 
from 
students, 
who seek an “easy A” course 
in order to graduate on time. 
It’s especially apparent among 
STEM majors in the first-year 

writing requirement and the 
upper-level writing requirement. 
As per the writing requirement, 
non-engineering 
STEM majors must 
take 
one 
writing 
course 
freshman 
year and one writing 
course 
typically 
during senior year. 
If you hate writing, 
there 
are 
plenty 
of 
options 
that 
technically 
fulfill 
this 
requirement 
but do not actually 
fulfill 
the 
whole 
objective behind a distribution 
requirement. 
For 
example, 
writing an Honors Thesis can be 
considered upper-level writing. 
Additionally, 
taking 
a 
lab 
course that requires extensive 
laboratory 
experimental 
write-ups 
also 
potentially 
counts toward the upper-level 
writing requirement. Here’s 
the reality: Writing a scientific 
write-up versus a personal 
statement for graduate school 
applications versus an upper-
level 
writing 
requirement 
essay are different from one 
another. It requires a distinct 
set of skills to accomplish each 
task successfully. Therefore, 
knowing how to write a lab 
report does not mean you 
know how to properly reflect 
and write your own story in a 
personal statement.
This is what I urge the 
University to do: Implement 
specific, 
tangible 
skill-based 
competencies that are related 
to each major and remove 
the 
widespread 
open-ended 
distribution requirements that 
are often too overwhelming 
to be useful. Through these 
established 
competencies, 
students will be exposed to 
diverse concepts, pushed to 
think critically and shown the 
cross-over that exists between 
writing, 
communication, 
understanding of the justice 
system and additional topics 
outside of the discipline that 
they’re pursuing. By doing so, 
the 
University 
requirements 
will encourage students to be 
open-minded and to constantly 
learn. Skills like writing or a 
foundation in statistics will 
prove to be helpful in their 
future careers and will serve 
as more than just a distribution 
requirement to check off on the 
audit checklist. 
Another aptitude to consider 
enforcing 
involves 
requiring 
different types of writing every 
single year. Let’s say freshman 
year is an introduction to 
literary analysis and college-

level interpretations of a wide 
variety of texts. It is then 
pointless to a non-English major 
to take yet another literary-
analysis-heavy course. Instead, 
the purpose of the sophomore 
year 
writing 
course 
would 
be to explore another area of 
the English language such as 
creative writing or writing 
about social change. In junior 
and 
senior 
year, 
it’s 
most 
useful if the English courses 
are centered upon professional 
writing — personal statement 
writing, essays for summer 
internships, CV/resume writing 
for recruitment season, etc.
Additionally, undergraduates 
on the pre-health track should 
be required to develop an 
understanding of global health 
care 
delivery 
systems 
and 
introductory 
public 
health 
concepts regardless of whether 
or not they are a student in 
the School of Public Health. 
Our future doctors, nurses, 
physician’s assistants, dentists 
and 
veterinarians 
need 
to 
be 
equipped 
to 
speak 
on 
topics related to health care 
policies and interventions that 
impact health in the greater 
population. Public health and 
medicinal work go hand-in-
hand. Therefore, it is essential 
to provide future health care 
professionals with experience 
in that collaborative approach 
rather than fulfill. On the other 
hand, undergraduates on the 
pre-law in LSA track should be 
required to not only understand 
public policy but also indulge 
in courses related to gender 
and health, race and ethnicity 
and cultural studies to develop 
a big-picture understanding of 
the populations to be dealt with 
as a professional. 
Changing 
the 
course 
requirements in this way will 
prepare University graduates 
to take on challenges in the 
workplace 
and 
send 
them 
out into the world to pursue 
innovative solutions to global 
issues. As college students, we 
are privileged to have unlimited 
access to a diverse range of 
courses, 
departments 
and 
world-renowned professors. It 
is incumbent upon us to take 
advantage of all the University 
has to offer. To only take 
courses that strictly fit your 
future vocation is a disservice 
to yourself. So it’s worth asking 
the question: At what other 
point in your career will you 
have the opportunity to explore 
multiple paths?

s 
Halloween 
ends, 
Americans look forward 
to the next major holiday: 
Thanksgiving. Excitement for 
a day full of family, football and 
food fills the air and motivates 
students and workers to push 
through their stress for a day 
or two off. However, while the 
holiday is centered on gratitude 
and food, its true history is 
ignored — exchanged for the 
colonized version prominently 
told in classrooms and cartoons.
The traditional story goes 
like this: in 1620, the Pilgrims 
set 
sail 
on 
the 
Mayflower 
for the New World. After a 
difficult journey, they landed on 
Plymouth only to barely survive 
the winter. But with the help of 
the Wampanoag tribe teaching 
them how to cultivate the land, 
the Pilgrims had a bountiful 
harvest in 1621 and shared a 
feast with the Wampanoags. 
While a sweet story, it is riddled 
with falsehoods — all wrapped 
in a bow. There is no mention of 
how the Native Americans had 
already 
established 
autumnal 
harvest feasts, how the Pilgrims 
viewed the tribes as savages or 
how the colonizers slaughtered 
the Pequot tribe 16 years later in 
the Mystic massacre. 
The story is not completely 
false, though. There was a feast 
in 1621 seemingly shared with 
the Wampanoag tribe. However, 
it was likely due to the Pilgrims’ 
desperation for food or to draft 
a treaty. The feast was not the 
stereotypical, happy gathering 
society depicts. In fact, there 
was not another such feast until 
1637 after the aforementioned 
Mystic 
massacre, 
in 
which 
hundreds Native Americans were 
slaughtered, with estimates as 
high as 700, including women 
and children. Survivors were 
enslaved. Deemed by the leading 
Captain Mason as an “act of 
God,” 
the 
massacre 
marked 
the end of the Pequot War and 
demonstrated a brutal future 
for the Native people. The day 
after the massacre, Governor 
John Winthrop declared the 
colonizers’ victory a “day of 
celebration and thanksgiving for 

subduing the Pequots.” As such, 
historians have proposed this 
celebration was a mixture of both 
events. 
Yet, 
the 
traditional 
story 
continues to be told. And it 
makes consumer sense. The 
story of Pilgrims, adventure 
and gratitude is heartwarming, 
especially when compared to the 
truth. The whitewashed version 
of Thanksgiving not only erases 
the history of the holiday, but it 
erases the entire history between 
colonizers and Native Americans. 
By telling stories about how 
Native Americans and colonizers 
got along, the history of genocide 
is ignored. 
We cannot change our history 
or how it has been previously 
told, but we can change how our 
history is told going forward. 
We can acknowledge the hurt 
our government has inflicted 
and the current crises Native 
Americans are facing. There are 
high suicide rates among Native 
youth, a homelessness crisis, 
violence against women and 
land and human rights issues. 
These are only a few issues Native 
Americans face, yet almost all are 
consistently not given adequate 
coverage by the news and other 
media.
This 
does 
not 
mean 
Thanksgiving needs to be spent 
in shame and guilt. Instead, 
we should strive to recognize 
that traditional depictions of 
Thanksgiving are not historically 
accurate, and not everyone in 
America celebrates it in that way. 
For example, the United American 
Indians of New England work to 
educate others about the reality of 
colonizer interactions, teach the 
actual history of Thanksgiving 
and honor those who were 
slaughtered. They host a National 
Day of Mourning in Plymouth, 
Mass. The event is held on 
Thanksgiving, and it was started 
by Wampanoag leader Wamsutta 
Frank 
James. 
This 
event 
contrasts with the traditional 
Thanksgiving celebration, and 
it does not necessarily mean 
everyone in America needs to 
participate. Rather, the National 
Day of Mourning serves as an 

educational example and as an 
opportunity for people to reflect 
on our nation’s treatment of 
Native Americans. The event 
reveals the history too many 
choose to ignore.
The aforementioned Mystic 
massacre was the first major 
conflict between Native peoples 
in America. English colonizers 
paid no attention to who they 
killed, 
callously 
murdering 
American Indians in their path. 
Our 
American 
Thanksgiving 
marks the colonizers’ win and 
one of the mass slaughters of 
Native 
Americans. 
Obviously, 
our Thanksgiving now does 
not celebrate the brutality and 
genocide of Native Americans. 
However, it is still important 
to understand our history and 
acknowledge what our past people 
and United States government 
has done and continues to do. 
The government continues to 
mistreat Native American tribes, 
as seen with the Dakota Access 
Pipeline and federal control of 
Native American land. 
When we, as the victors, 
distort history to our favor, we 
are not only doing a disservice 
to Native Americans, but we are 
doing a disservice to ourselves. 
We can never know everything, 
but we can educate ourselves on 
our American history and learn 
from it. When we acknowledge 
that the Pilgrims and Puritans 
were not saints, and how the 
American Indians were brutally 
raped, murdered and enslaved, 
we can start a process of healing 
and reparations. 
There 
is 
nothing 
wrong 
with celebrating a traditional 
Thanksgiving. Eat your turkey, 
cheer for your favorite football 
team and relax with your family 
or friends. However, remember 
there is more to Thanksgiving 
than gratitude and the sharing 
of food. The U.S. has an 
ugly history with the Native 
Americans. So, as Thanksgiving 
approaches, 
remember 
the 
catastrophic history of the first 
Thanksgiving.

A

s 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives proceed 
with their impeachment 
inquiry, more evidence has come 
to light regarding a suspicious, 
almost certainly illegal, deal with 
Ukraine. While representatives 
consider how they will vote if and 
when the House holds a formal 
vote of impeachment, they ought 
to decide the same way they 
would in a civilan grand jury 
investigation. 
In an impeachment inquiry, 
the House’s role is similar to that 
of a grand jury during a criminal 
trial. It hears evidence and 
decides whether to proceed with 
charges – here called articles of 
impeachment. Since grand jury 
investigations are closed to the 
public, the Republican outcry 
about the House investigation 
being 
closed 
is 
completely 
unwarranted, especially when 
one considers that a Republican-
controlled House conducted a 
similar closed-door investigation 
into former Secretary of State 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 
decisions 
regarding 
Benghazi. 
In 
any 
other scenario relating to a 
public official, a grand jury 
would almost certainly decide 
to charge the defendant, but 
since this is the president of the 
United States it makes sense that 
the House is being so scrupulous. 
That said, if they determine that 
they have enough evidence to 
indict, they absolutely should 
because one of the most basic 
tenets of democracy is equality 
under the law. 
The 
understanding 
that 
a powerful politician is still 
subject to the same laws as a 
normal citizen undergirds our 
criminal justice system. People 
should have a reasonable level 
of confidence that being charged 
or not charged with a crime is a 
result of the evidence and only 
the evidence, and while the 
current system often does not 
actually follow this ideal, holding 
our politicians accountable for 
their actions is a step in the right 
direction.
When people can flout laws, 
tyranny 
could 
follow. 
One 
of the first steps in turning a 

democracy into a tyrannical state 
is to create a double standard 
between lawmakers and regular 
citizens. A distinction between 
the two could elevate a leader to 
a protected legal status that could 
reduce their accountability and 
thus would enable them to engage 
in activites considered criminal if 
done by normal citizens. This is 
a stepping stone to authoritarian 
rule because powerful leaders 
can begin to disregard the entire 
system of laws upholding our 
country, which prevents them 
from being responsible for the 
laws they create. If a lawmaker is 
free from answering to the rule 
of law, they can use it as a tool for 
their personal gain rather than as 
a foundation for our society.

The 
argument 
that, 
even 
if there is enough evidence to 
suggest that the president is 
guilty, impeachment would be 
too disruptive for the country 
is absurd. We as Americans 
are all expected to follow our 
nation’s laws, and that includes 
the president. The Office of 
Legal 
Council 
policy 
that 
Robert Mueller cited during 
his testimony to Congress this 
summer says a sitting president 
cannot be charged in a crime by a 
federal prosecutor because doing 
so 
would 
unconstitutionally 
undermine the president’s ability 
to fulfill his or her duties. That 
does not mean the president 
is above the law, rather that 
there is a different process for 
charging him or her with a 
crime. That obligation falls not 
on the Department of Justice 
but on Congress to investigate, 
impeach and ultimately convict a 
president. This different process 

alone accounts for the higher 
responsibility of the president 
than a normal citizen.
While being cautious with 
impeachment 
is 
important, 
failing to impeach because the 
president is considered “too busy” 
is a standard that protects every 
other powerful person accused of 
a crime. If anything, influential 
people in our society should be 
subject to more scrutiny than 
others because their actions have 
further-reaching consequences. 
Above all else, their positions 
are responsibilities, and that 
responsibility 
ought 
to 
be 
insulated 
against 
potential 
corruption. 
Furthermore, 
subjecting 
these 
influential 
lawmakers to their own laws 
will force them to examine any 
potential legislation or policy 
through a personal lens, which 
creates a powerful incentive to be 
an effective policymaker. 
Impeaching a president does 
not mean they will be removed 
from office, nor does it mean 
that they will be ineffective at 
their job. Though two presidents 
have been impeached in U.S. 
history, neither was removed 
from office. Impeachment is 
simply an agreement to charge 
the president with a crime, not 
convict. Subjecting a president to 
congressional scrutiny through 
impeachment ensures that their 
conduct does not betray U.S. 
interests or citizens. 
When the House evaluates 
the evidence brought to light 
by their impeachment inquiry 
into Donald Trump, they should 
disregard Trump’s status as 
president. Working with foreign 
governments 
to 
undermine 
America’s democratic processes 
is an offense that should be 
considered 
with 
the 
utmost 
objectivity because it can be 
so detrimental to our nation. 
Allowing such crimes to go 
uninvestigated because of the 
president’s power could set a 
far worse precedent for future 
leaders 
than 
would 
passing 
articles of impeachment.

STYLE COLUMN

Throughout 2019, there have been fairly 
consistent reportings of what economists 
call a “bull market,” meaning that consumer 
spending habits, especially within the umbrella 
of Fortune 500 companies, are indicative of a 
“healthy” economy. It goes without saying, of 
course, that there are questions to be raised 
about who benefits from such conditions, off 
of whose labor, what direction the money is 
going and to what extent those assessments 
are based off of mega-corporate valuations 
that ultimately have little to no effect on the 
average consumer. I’m not here to talk about 
the goings on of the DOW with any shred of 
authority on the matter — my idea of money 
is more or less rooted in how many pairs of 
indigo-dyed pants I can buy and random 
Twitter GoFundMe pages I can donate to 
without being restricted to a diet of fried 
bread and Trader Joe’s instant oatmeal. I can, 
however, reflect on my own experiences and 
relate them to things I’ve been told to believe 
and ways I’ve been taught to think. In a system 
that heralds money as its god and grants 
access to it through proximity to accepted 
ways of being, it pays 
to stop for a minute and 
make sure you’re being 
kind to yourself.
Despite what those 
aforementioned reports 
have to say, it certainly 
feels as though retail is 
in peril. At the very least, 
it’s reached a saturation 
point: there are multiple 
covetable 
sneaker 
releases 
every 
week 
now, and pairs that were 
once nearly impossible 
to get without a $50 bot 
service or a “connect” 
are 
now 
sitting 
on 
shelves multiple days 
later. 
Sell-through 
at 
huge 
online 
retailers 
for 
very 
well-known 
labels appears to be 
slowing while size runs 
and brand indexes are 
growing 
rapidly 
in 
depth, and it seems as 
though everyone and 
their mother is running a cosmetics company 
backed by the deepest of pockets. It doesn’t 
take an MBA to take note of a number of 
markets that are self-multiplying right now, 
and that both means that financial success 
in those sectors will become more difficult 
over time and that major corporations will 
fail to adapt to their market and end up going 
by the wasteside. The latter can be seen most 
recently with Barneys New York, which could 
very well be hosting an online fire sale by the 
time this column hits print.
The same thing can be seen with beauty 
bloggers, podcasters, models, influencers and 
other people who engage with their audience 
directly as an online media entity. Some of 
them are the physical manifestation of an eye-
roll, making millions of dollars a year in ad 
revenue for reasons unbeknownst to anyone. 
Some of them are incredibly toxic outposts 
that amplify their audience’s worst qualities. 
Some of them are doing actual work, too, but 
the vehicles that allowed all of them to exist in 
the capacities that they do are the same ones 

that have eroded the barrier between how we 
conceive ourselves and the market we operate 
within. As time goes on, identity is becoming 
radicalized with respect to its financial 
viability, and every personal expression can 
feel like a bid for tangible worth. 
This phenomenon can take on a special 
weight for those of us that already don’t have 
the easiest go of it. Queerness is often treated 
as an umbrella term for the LGBTQIA+ 
community, and it certainly can function that 
way in some contexts. But it also refers more 
generally to those who, to put it plainly, are 
denied access to capital gain. To be a person of 
color, to be a woman, to lie anywhere outside 
of the cis-heteronormative ideal, to live with 
mental illness, to not be “able-bodied,” to be 
born into poverty or to be born in an area 
without the resources necessary to live a 
healthy and fulfilling life, is to be queer in some 
way or another. But it is also to enter a forced 
and constant set of negotiations between self 
and exterior. There’s a simultaneous back 
and forth between authenticity and safety, 
between different ideas of what success 
means, what happiness means, what it means 
to represent a community, not to mention the 
never ending barrage of internalized feelings 
of never being able to have done enough. To 
have worked enough. 
As someone who feels 
most concerned about 
fashion and “personal 
style,” simply getting 
out the door can feel 
like a matter of life 
and death. As a child, I 
would melt into a small 
pool of cortisol at the 
news that the T-shirt I 
had planned for the day 
was not dry enough to 
wear. To this day, my 
answer to any version 
of that ridiculous ice 
breaker question “What 
couple items would you 
take to be deserted on 
an island?” is a mobile 
outlet 
and 
a 
hand-
held steamer. I often 
spend 
more 
money 
than I make because 
I feel that pressure to 
be the absolute best 
representation of myself 
at all times. I feel that 
need to treat the advantages I do have as some 
kind of zero-sum investment in what queerness 
can look like. That philosophy carries over 
into my writing, into my schoolwork, and that 
mindset is frankly untenable. 
The other day, my therapist told me that 
I need to “strive for mediocrity,” and that 
idea really stuck with me. Not because I’ve 
now decided to assimilate and coast on my 
privilege, but because the idea that everything 
needs to be perfectly executed is a truly cruel 
one. It’s one that we inflict on ourselves, and 
it’s one that we’re taught. For those of us that 
can feel the threat of subjugation, of violence 
and ostracization, that idea is only amplified. 
It can be easy to start feeling the weight of a 
community, but it’s important to remember 
that its entirety isn’t squarely on anyone’s 
back. Real, tangible value lies in taking a 
second to breathe, in reminding yourself that 
all anyone can do is go through their day doing 
the best that they can. We’re told that the best 
thing we can be is kind, but person that needs 
it the most is often yourself.

Velveteen Dreams: Less
money, more mediocrity

It is not impossible to adapt Shakespeare’s 400-year-
old plays for contemporary audiences. In fact, certain 
films — “10 Things I Hate About You,” “West Side Story” 
and Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo and Juliet” included — 
prove that it can be done exceptionally well, bringing 
Shakespeare’s timeless plots back into our world with 
style, creativity and intent. 
“The King,” Netflix’s latest venture into historical 
drama, unfortunately does not earn a spot alongside 
these other films. Though it is true to its source material, 
almost too true, and is generally impeccably shot and 
acted, there is something missing. That something is 
energy — the lack of it ultimately becoming its fatal 
flaw. It is unfathomably boring, which is surprising 
coming from source material that is jam-packed with 
action, conflict and character development. I admire 
anyone who can get through it in one sitting. 
“The King” tells the more or less true story of 
Henry V’s ascent to the English throne in the early 
15th century following the death of his father. Henry, 
referred to as Hal in the movie and played by Timothée 
Chalamet (“Beautiful Boy”), is forced to abandon 
his immature and womanizing lifestyle in order 

to face the threat posed by the French army, led by 
Robert Pattinson (“The Lighthouse”) as the Dauphin 
of France. It is a classic monomyth, illustrating one 
person’s transformation from a boy into a man. 
Though Chalamet does his best to bring depth and 

personality to Hal, one can’t help but feel as though the 
character would have been better portrayed by an actor 
who can better pull off the assertiveness and authority 
that’s expected of a king. Perhaps my perceptions 
of Chalamet as an actor have been muddled by my 
understanding of him as a quintessential “soft boy,” but 
I just don’t think he was all that convincing. And when 
the portrayal of a character whose arc determines 
the course of the entire film is less than excellent, 
everything else within the film suffers as a result. It 
is near impossible to feel invested in a movie when 
you can’t bring yourself to care about the fate of its 
protagonist. 
The film does have one saving grace, and that is 
Pattinson’s unabashedly ludicrous, wonderfully insane 
joke of a performance that feels so out of place that it 
becomes the best thing about the film. His accent, 
which sounds like a mix of both Tommy Wiseau and 
the most stereotypical French accent you could possibly 
imagine, is absolutely fascinating to bear witness to, 
and it, along with his equally bizarre dialogue, gives 
us a much needed break from the film’s overbearing 
seriousness. Pattinson’s hair, which channels the likes 
of “Shrek 2”’s Prince Charming, tops off what is easily 
one of the most memorable performances of this year. 
It is a shame he didn’t get more screen time; I think my 
overall opinion of the film would be much different if 
he did. 
“The King” is the kind of Shakespeare adaptation 
I could see being shown in a high school English 
classroom, and I don’t mean that as praise. It tells 
the story of Henry V as written by Shakespeare well 
enough, but without any elements of daring or risk-
taking that we know to be essential to the making 
of a truly worthwhile and necessary adaptation. I 
empathize with any students from the future who will 
be forced to watch it. The film’s swift and inevitable 
erasure from our collective memory should serve as 
a lesson to Netflix that no amount of money and no 
amount of star power can make up for a lack of passion.

Remove Mary Poppins’s umbrella, set Jane 
and Michael Banks on fire and you would have 
the basic premise of Kevin Wilson’s “Nothing to 
See Here.” After years of estrangement, Lillian 
receives a desperate letter from her once-best 
friend, Madison, asking her to take care of her 
two stepchildren, Bessie and Roland, in the wake 
of their mother’s abrupt death. Upon arrival to 
Madison’s wealthy estate, Lillian learns that the 
children she is now responsible for spontaneously 
combust into flames when agitated — in the 
following pages, she discovers that they like to 
bite people, too. The ten-year old children, much 
like Lillian herself, are social rejects — their 
unfortunate bowl cuts and tendency to burst 
into flames set 
themselves 
in 
stark 
contrast 
to their peers. 
Not that they 
have a chance to 
even meet other 
children, given 
that they are 
confined to an 
isolated house 
their father had 
made just for 
them, one fitted 
with a complete 
sprinkler 
system. 
The 
novel 
follows 
Lillian, 
Bessie 
and Roland as 
they learn how 
to trust each 
other and break down the emotional barriers that 
they have erected in response to past traumas. 
Lillian’s working-class background situates 
her as a commentator on the lavish lifestyles of 
Madison and her husband, Jasper, providing 
readers with a steady stream of sarcasm and wit. 
It includes a healthy mix of humorous scenes, 
including trips to the local library to steal books 
about Dolly Parton and emotional reconciliations 
typical of a feel-good movie. All that is missing is 

a musical number. 
But, even if this novel is an easy read, it is not a 
wholly superficial one. It could have been written 
very poorly, especially in regards to character 
portrayal. It would have been easy for Wilson 
to fall into the trap of typical binary character 
depictions by painting Madison as an evil-rich 
stepmother character, or Bessie and Roland as 
gentle but misunderstood children who just want 
their father’s love. But the characters that Wilson 

presents to us are flawed, angry, spiteful and, 
thus, much more human. 
Nevertheless, certain events in “Nothing to See 
Here” are settled in a way that is disappointingly 
lighthearted, just a bit too easy and optimistic. The 
ending is summed up neatly — it is predictable. 
While Wilson does a good job building up 
the plot to a certain point, he ultimately lets 
the crescendo fall flat. The deeper issues 
of confronting emotional manipulation and 
damage are hinted at several times throughout 
the novel, but they are packaged very abruptly, 
even unrealistically, in the remaining few pages. 
Though these problems are logistically solved, 
there remains a dubious feeling of unresolve. 
When I turned the last page, I didn’t feel 
gutted — just mildly annoyed. There are flashes 
of potentially compelling moments, but they 
quickly fizzle out. If there is a way to describe 
this novel, it would be to return to the Mary 
Poppins comparison and catalog it as a Disney 
movie in literary form. With a witty lead 
character, a tinge of romance and just enough 
altercations to make readers sweat but not cause 
damage that can’t be resolved neatly at the 
end, “Nothing to See Here” hints that there is 
something to see here, but not too much.

“The Man Without Gravity” is a fantasy film 
with the least amount of fantasy possible. It 
begins with Oscar, the titular “man,” born in 
a tiny Italian village. Right out of the womb, he 
floats in the air like a balloon and doesn’t stop. 
His mother and grandmother are awestruck, 
calling it both a gift from God and something out 
of an American movie. 
This is the first instance of the film’s 
intoxicating blend of classic fantasy and modern 
day. It frequently compares the stereotypical 
“fable” 
with 
its 
modern 
versions: 
superhero 
stories, 
reality 
television 
and 
tabloid 
news. 
Oscar’s 
miraculousness 
aside, 
his 
family 
raises him inside 
their 
house 
and 
away 
from 
prying 
eyes. 
The 
fantastical conflict 
doesn’t 
have 
wizards, orcs or goblins. Instead, Oscar, played by 
Pietro Pescara when he is little and Elio Germano 
(“Lucia’s Grace”) when he’s an adult, battles 
the universal trial of being different in a hostile 
world. 
The effects used to make Oscar float are top 
notch. Seeing Oscar drift in and out of frame is 
one of the year’s greatest cinematic pleasures. 
To walk normally, Oscar wears a backpack filled 
with weights, just one of the small but fascinating 
ways that “The Man Without Gravity” gives its 
fantasy real weight, juxtaposing ethereal magic 
with mundane facts of life. The most fantastical 
elements of the film, though, are its most human: 
colorful Italian villages, distant fireworks and 
the simple act of holding someone’s hand. 
Oscar grows up watching Batman cartoons and 
believes that his powers make him a superhero, 
too. His mother agrees and says that, like Bruce 
Wayne, he has to keep his identity a secret. Oscar 
is human, though, and eventually goes out into 
the world. Venturing out on his own, he meets 
Agata (Jennifer Brokshi), a young girl who falls in 

love with Oscar and his powers.
These early scenes soar with naivety and hope, 
capturing the pure imagination and joy that only 
kids can feel. It’ll make anyone yearn for a simpler 
time when differences seem to mean nothing. 
Decades pass without any heraldry, or even 
notice, with simple jump cuts throwing the viewer 
into another time in Oscar’s life. It ingeniously 
mirrors life, as the years go by without one 
realizing. The film uses multiple actors for both 
Oscar and Agata, as well as heavy makeup to age 
other characters, both of which are completely 
convincing. 
As Oscar grows older, things become more 
complicated. He has to choose how he will live. 
Will he hide his 
exceptionality, like 
his 
mother 
begs 
him to, or share it 
with the world, like 
in his daydreams? 
Eventually 
Oscar 
leaves seclusion and 
tries 
to 
navigate 
the 
modern 
world, 
where 
his 
antigravity 
begins 
to seem less like a 
gift and more like a 
condition.
There are no epic quests or giant battles in this 
fantasy. There’s just one man and a multitude 
of difficult choices. Being different isn’t all 
it’s cracked up to be, and “The Man Without 
Gravity” does not shy away from this. Prejudice 
and exploitation are abundant in the lives of 
people deemed “other” by the masses. There is 
no school of magic or valiant fellowships when 
living on society’s edges, and Oscar encounters 
some of modern society’s worst — how it treats 
the marginalized. 
“The Man Without Gravity” is a fantastical 
concept but mirrors very human dilemmas, a 
story that could take place anywhere, and will 
affect everyone, everywhere. At one time or 
another, everyone has felt alone in the world. 
Oscar is less a superhero and more a beleaguered 
man just trying to get through life like everyone 
else and suppress what makes him different. 
Yet “The Man Without Gravity” argues that, for 
better or worse, our distinctions are what make 
us so magically human.

Gravity

TV REVIEW

With the amount of television being created, it becomes harder to 
sift through the options and differentiate between the garbage and 
the gems. I spend a lot of time thinking about the television shows 
I choose to devote my attention to: Is it being produced because 
a platform needs more original content? Does it have potential 
to be a high quality program? Is there an enticing plot? Premium 
broadcast channels such as HBO continue to produce consistently 
high quality programming with short seasons that contain tight 
narratives and complex plots. “Silicon Valley” continues this trend, 
as it simultaneously wraps up 
old story lines and brings in new 
ones. 
Given 
the 
conversation 
surrounding the tech industry, 
data collection and Congress, it’s 
fitting that the first scene of the 
farewell season to “Silicon Valley” 
begins where it began six years 
prior — the protagonist Richard 
Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch, 
“Dream Corp LLC”) making a 
fool of himself. Except this time, 
he isn’t an aspirational one-in-a-
million employee trying to make it in a cutthroat industry. Until the 
Season 5 finale, the success of Hendricks’s start-up company, Pied 
Piper, was not guaranteed. Given the hard-fought battle endured 
by Richard and his team over the previous five seasons, this makes 
one last season all the more satisfying — one in which Richard is no 
longer fighting the uphill battle. If only that were the case.
The season opens with Richard continuing his winning 
streak as he presents himself in an unusually confident manner, 
delivering a speech in which he promises that his company will 
not be corrupt like Facebook, Google or Amazon and collect user 
data. Unfortunately, Richard soon learns that this is a lie. Richard 
unknowingly lies to Congress as the game developer Colin (Neil 
Casey, “Big Mouth”) explains he does collect data on PiperNet — 

a network that allows users to control their own data rather than 
storing it on a centralized server — to improve gameplay quality. 
Richard orders him to stop, but Colin has the upper hand. He owns 
the gaming platform which makes up PiperNet’s largest user base. 
Although the Pied Piper team has made ethical exceptions in the 
past, Richard justifies them as necessary and promises they will be 
erased once the reality of their company is ensured. If he fires Colin 
to stick to his morals, PiperNet will be at risk of shutting down. 
On the other hand, what Colin is doing goes against their defining 
principle. Board members Monica (Amanda Crew, “Tone-Deaf”), 
Gilfoyle (Martin Starr, “Drunk History”) and Dinesh (Kumail 
Nanjiani, “Bless the Harts”) decide to let it slide because without 
Colin’s users, Pied Piper has no chance to succeed.
Richard 
decides 
to 
take 
matters into his own hands by 
exploiting a marginalized and 
vulnerable Jared (Zach Woods, 
“Big Mouth”), who is normally 
the voice of reason. He knows 
he is making the wrong decision 
but sees this as an opportunity to 
get back on the inside. The two 
of them become responsible for 
facilitating a blackmail scheme 
directed at Colin and driven by 
artificial intelligence. Naturally, 
this backfires for Richard and 
leaves Pied Piper with a huge data collection bag, and Colin’s board 
members are excited about the prospects of this new tool.
It is this kind of storyline that suggests the final season will 
ride its familiar formula success. Given that we only have six more 
episodes, it’s hard to fault executive producers Mike Judge and Alec 
Berg for not messing with what has already worked so well. It will 
rely on the fortunes and misfortunes of its characters’ peaks and 
valleys, all in the context of a single episode. Despite everything 
that the characters have been through, the question that has driven 
every season is what will ensure a successful end to an already 
successful series: Can this group of misfits succeed and create a 
product that will make the world a better place? Richard has six 
weeks to figure it out.

‘Bruises’

Lewis Capaldi

Capital Records

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘BRUISES’

After the great success of his tear-jerking 
hit “Someone You Loved,” Lewis Capaldi 
has given us another reason to cry with his 
new music video for “Bruises.” A tune off his 
most recent album, Divinely Uninspired To A 
Hellish Extent, “Bruises” reminisces on an old 
relationship and all its 
fond memories, detailing 
the times when it’s hard 
to remember why you 
separated from someone 
you used to love. Like 
“Someone You Loved,” 
“Bruises” is a compelling 
ballad about heartbreak, 
and the video’s storyline pairs perfectly with 
Capaldi’s passionate delivery of the song. 
The video features a young couple in the 
aftermath of their relationship, depicting 
flashbacks of the times when they were 
together as they intensely stare at each other. 
Tension builds as the video progresses, 
ultimately leading to a massive fight between 
two groups of prisoners representing each 

person in the relationship. Capaldi is also 
featured in the video belting the tune in a 
desolate landscape and eventually going up in 
flames, burning as the couple’s scene becomes 
extremely hostile.
Peace is restored at the end of video, as the 
fighting crowds disappear 
and the couple is once 
again left alone staring 
into each other’s eyes. 
While it’s not completely 
clear 
whether 
or 
not 
they’ve reconciled, the 
video ends with each 
person extending their 
arm out to the other as if they’ve reached 
some sort of truce. Carefully crafted and well-
delivered, “Bruises” is a simple approach to 
a complex concept. Capaldi has once again 
successfully 
captured 
difficult 
emotions, 
neatly packaging them into a brief video for us 
to cry along with.

In My Room

Frank Ocean

Blonded

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘IN MY ROOM’

Frank Ocean has not simply 
returned to the music scene 
— after more than a year of 
general silence, he’s made a 
powerful comeback with two 
singles released a mere 13 days 
apart. In terms of Ocean’s 
history, this is almost unheard 
of. As they say, it’s not 
a Frank Ocean album 
until he makes you wait 
four years to hear it. On 
Oct. 19, Ocean released 
“DHL,” which sparked 
the yearly discussion 
of whether or not he’ll 
be releasing a new album. In 
the interim, he’s been hosting 
a series of secretive nightclub 
events under the label “PrEP+,” 

allegedly debuting new songs 
at each one. On Nov. 1, Ocean 
officially released a second 
single, “In My Room,” much 
to the surprise and joy of his 
fanbase. 
Only two minutes and 14 
seconds long, “In My Room” 

definitely isn’t your average 
Frank 
Ocean 
song. 
It’s 
comparatively short and leans 
more towards Ocean’s elusive 

rap sound, i.e. 2017’s “RAF,” 
than the bulk of his work. The 
single is objectively catchy, with 
a repetitive beat that actually 
makes the song a perfect loop 
of itself.
With that being said, this 
song grows on you the more you 
listen to it. It might not 
be the most compelling 
single Ocean has ever 
released, 
especially 
when it’s competing with 
2017 cult favorites like 
“Chanel” and “Biking,” 
but it definitely bodes well 
for what he might be giving us 
in the near future.

Teske’s career night anchors Wolverines in season-opening victory

When Jon Teske’s baseline post 
hook grazed the left side of the 
rim on the opening possession, it 
didn’t take long for him to clean 
up his own mess.
Instead 
of 
trotting 
back 
on defense, the senior center 
bulldozed into the paint to corral 
his own rebound. In one fell 
swoop, he landed on the other 
side of the basket and, as if on a 
pogo stick, sprung back up and 
finished the job with a layup off 
the glass.
Grinding through the teeth of 
the defense set the tone for Teske’s 
first-half double-double in the 

Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
79-71 win over Appalachian State 
(0-1) on Tuesday night. He starred 
in the season-opener, dominating 
the paint on both ends of the floor 
and owning the glass. By the end 
of the night, he amassed 17 points 
and a career-high 13 rebounds.
After winning the tipoff, first-
year head coach Juwan Howard 
called Teske’s number in the 
post. It worked, so he went back 
to his big man again on the next 
possession. Same result. By the 
first media timeout, Teske had 
accounted for the Wolverines’ 
(1-0) first 11 points. He sank his 
next four shots following the 
early missed hook, with two 
coming around the rim, another 

from mid-range territory and the 
fourth from beyond the arc.
“(Howard) drew up a lot of 
great plays, and fortunately I 
was able to finish around the 
rim,” Teske said after the game. 
“My teammates were able to find 
me. (I was) just using my height 
advantage well in the frontcourt 
… I was able to get a quick 
couple points in the first couple 
minutes.”
Added Howard: “(Teske) got 
into a really good groove. He 
was very aggressive out there 
offensively. He did a very good job 
on rebounds in the first half, too. 
He was battling in there. … We all 
know he can shoot the basketball, 
he proved that tonight.”

At 7-foot-1, Teske’s impact 
on 
the 
glass 
and 
scoring 
ability anchor the Wolverines’ 
frontcourt. For a team that lost 
half its offensive production from 
a year ago to early departures, the 
presence of a center of Teske’s 
caliber can ease the transition.
As a cornerstone of the starting 
lineup on a team adjusting to 
a 
new-look 
offense, 
Teske’s 
ability to score at all three levels 
provides a meaningful boost. 
He repeatedly created quality 
looks on the block against the 
Mountaineers, 
who 
have 
no 
players taller than 6-foot-9, but 
the going will get tougher against 
a conference littered with seven-
footers.

Behind Teske’s big first half, 
in which he posted 15 points 
and 11 rebounds, the Wolverines 
stretched their lead to as much 
as 30. Even when the ball wasn’t 
in his hands, the defensive 
attention Teske drew made him a 
difference-maker.
“(Teske) was a big influence of 
that (lead),” said junior guard Eli 
Brooks. “ … His presence allowed 
me and other shooters to have 
open shots because they were so 
focused on him.”
One of Howard’s primary 
responsibilities as an assistant 
coach with the Miami Heat was 
developing big men. On Tuesday 
night, the immediate dividends 
were apparent.
Beyond Teske’s career night, 
sophomores 
Colin 
Castleton 
and Brandon Johns Jr. both saw 
time in the frontcourt. Together, 
they posted a combined 13 points 
on 5-of-9 shooting across 30 
minutes. At times, they even 
shared the court with Teske — 
something that seldom occurred 
under former coach John Beilein.
But in his first game at the 
helm, Howard tinkered with the 
idea. Soon after deciding to give 
it a go, Teske fed a slashing Johns 
for an easy first-half dunk.
“It definitely is different,” 
Teske said. “I really enjoy playing 
big when Colin or Brandon is in 
there, I really like that. … It’s still 
early, so we’re still kind of playing 
around with lineups, too, seeing 
what works, what doesn’t, how 
we kind of mesh together.”
The 
growing 
pains 
were 
equally 
as 
noticeable 
on 
Tuesday night. Even as the 
Wolverines 
suffered 
through 
a 27-3 Appalachian State run, 
Teske’s ability to draw double-
teams in the post created scoring 
opportunities 
for 
perimeter 
players off kickouts.
Against 
the 
Mountaineers, 
Teske embodied everything that 
worked. And for Michigan, his 
steady presence could make all 
the difference in this transition 
period.

Michigan struggling to play full 60 minutes

Playing consistently.
It’s not something that can 
be taught. It’s not something 
that’s learned overnight. And 
it’s not something the Michigan 
hockey team has managed to do 
through the first eight games of 
the season. 
Sure, there’ve been some 
periods 
of 
good 
intensity. 
Occasionally, the Wolverines 
have a series of shifts where all 
the momentum seems to be with 
them. But these moments are 
seemingly always followed by 
spans of play that lack energy 
and speed.
“I think I could take a period 
from this game, a period from 
that game and string it all 
together,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “But I can’t tell you 
we’ve had a game where we’ve 
had a good 60 minutes. Even in 
the shutouts. We can say, ‘Wow 
we won, 4-0.’ But we haven’t had 
that (complete) game yet.”
Even though it’s early in the 
season, their inconsistent play 
has already cost the Wolverines 
some potential wins.
Last Friday, Michigan jumped 
out to a two-goal lead halfway 
through 
the 
second 
period 
against No. 9 Ohio State. Then 
it happened — the mental focus 

was gone.
Within a couple minutes, the 
Buckeyes cut the Wolverines’ 
lead in half. A few minutes later, 
the game was tied. And when 
the final buzzer sounded, the 
Buckeyes had completed their 
comeback, Michigan allowing 
three unanswered goals.
That 
game 
against 
Ohio 
State wasn’t the first time 
the Wolverines’ inability to 
play 
consistently 
throughout 
an entire game caused them 
trouble. 
On Oct. 19, the Wolverines 
faced 
Lake 
Superior 
State 
in game two of the weekend 
series. 
The 
previous 
night, 
they blanked the Lakers, 4-0, 
and after the first 20 minutes 
of Saturday’s game Michigan 
was cruising towards a victory, 
already ahead, 3-0.
As the second period began, 
the Wolverines looked like a 
completely different team on the 
ice — and it was for the worse. 
Their play was sloppy and 
lacked control. The team that 
had earned a three-goal lead 
just 20 minutes prior was 
nowhere to be found and the 
scoreboard reflected it — the 
Wolverines’ lead was cut to one. 
The inconsistency that haunted 
Michigan last season was back 
in full force.
“Definitely when you’re in 

the lead, you don’t want to play 
scared or timid,” said sophomore 
forward Jimmy Lambert. “You 
wanna make sure you keep 
pushing the same way that got 
you in the lead. Because if you sit 
back and just try and coast to the 
end, they’re going to obviously 
put pressure on you, and if 
you’re not putting pressure on 
them, it makes it way too easy 
for them. That’s when you get 
pinned down.”
Though Michigan managed 
to hold off Lake Superior State, 
that series wasn’t the only one 
where 
Friday’s 
energy 
and 
intensity didn’t carry over to 
Saturday’s game. 
On Oct. 26, the Wolverines 
traveled to Kalamazoo to play 
Western Michigan. Fresh off 
another 4-0 shutout win the 
night before, they looked to 
carry the momentum over to 
Saturday. But yet again, when 
the game started, Michigan fell 
flat.
In the opening three minutes 
of the game, the Broncos scored 
two goals, and the Wolverines, 
who had dominated just 24 
hours prior, crumbled. 
They 
weren’t 
disciplined. 
They were making careless 
turnovers. Michigan rebounded 
after the first minutes and 
stopped turning the puck over. 
But ultimately, it wasn’t enough 

to overcome the early deficit, as 
the Wolverines lost, 4-1, to split 
the series.
“It might not even be a period,” 
Lambert said. “It might just be 
five minutes. Or even one play. 
You take it off. That can change 
the entire game. Making sure 
that you’re completely dialed in 
for the entire game is one of the 
biggest components for having a 
successful night.”
But how does a team practice 
consistency? How does a coach 
push his team?
For Pearson, the answer isn’t 
only one thing. 
In practice, he makes sure to 
include drills that create high 
levels of competition. Recently, 
the lineup has seen some changes 
in an attempt to motivate certain 
players to push harder. He even 
has one-on-one meetings with 
players to make sure they know 
what’s expected of them.
“All we tell them is we expect 
nothing but your best,” Pearson 
said. “But what is your best? 
And we talk about that and we 
define that. Just give us your 
best. That’s all we’re trying to 
ask for. Then that’ll run into the 
games too. It sounds simple, but 
it’s hard to come down every day 
and practice and work hard.”
The push for more consistent 
play doesn’t only come from 
Pearson, though. The whole 
team strives to motivate each 
other in the locker room to push 
harder. Senior captain Will 
Lockwood holds his teammates 
accountable 
when 
they’re 
slacking in games.
And when Lockwood or the 
alternate captains slack off, one 
of the younger players will call 
them out on it.
With Big Ten play having 
opened last weekend, Michigan 
learned how crucial it is to figure 
out how to play a consistent, full 
60-minute game. And it needs to 
figure it out fast.
“It takes every guy in order 
to play a full 60,” Lockwood 
said. “I think every team kind 
of strives for that and it’s not the 
easiest thing to do. I think our 
record would be a lot different 
if we’d been doing that (playing 
consistently) for the whole year.”

Legislature introduces 
bill to allow player profit

Two 
Michigan 
legislators 
introduced 
a 
bipartisan 
plan 
Wednesday afternoon that would 
sanction current and future college 
athletes to profit off their name, 
likeness and image, according to an 
official news release.
State 
Reps. 
Brandt 
Iden, 
R-Oshtemo, and Joe Tate, D-Detroit 
— both former college athletes — 
presented bills allowing student-
athlete pay that, if signed into law, 
would go into effect July 2020.
“We’re not going to punt on this 
issue. We’re going to lead,” Iden, 
once a tennis player at Kalamazoo 
College, said in the release. “College 
sports is a billion-dollar business, 
but these outdated NCAA rules 
treat the student-athletes at the 
heart of that business unfairly. 
Right now, student-athletes have no 
liberty when it comes to capitalizing 
on their own names and images.”
The news comes a little over 
a month after California passed 
its Fair Pay to Play Act, that, 
similar to the proposed Michigan 
bills, 
permits 
student-athlete 
compensation for name, image and 
likeness starting in 2023. And just 
eight days ago, the NCAA Board of 
Directors voted to begin the process 

of considering fair compensation 
for its athletes.
The Iden-sponsored bill would 
entitle college athletes to receive 
money from third parties in 
exchange for using their name, 
likeness or image. Tate’s bill 
would legalize agents to enter into 
contracts with student athletes, 
currently considered a crime in 
Michigan.
“Someone can set up a signing 
at their store and charge $25 
per inscription, but the student-
athlete providing that signature 
or inscription gets nothing under 
current NCAA bylaws,” Tate, a 
former Michigan State football 
player 
and 
co-captain, 
said. 
“Athletes who are struggling to 
get by and unable to even have a 
little walking around money are 
going to be able to enter into the 
market 
through 
their 
current 
craft, and that’s a positive and just 
development.”
Michigan 
associate 
athletic 
director Kurt Svoboda offered 
The Daily a statement Wednesday 
regarding 
the 
newly-presented 
bills.
“The 
athletic 
department 
does not comment on pending 
legislation,” Svoboda said. “As 
such, we have no official comment 
here.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Fall 2017, in New Bremen, 

Ohio — population of 2,973 — 
then-Michigan commit Paige 
Jones brought home the first 
state championship for her 
high school, simultaneously 
setting state records for kills 
in the state tournament (72) 
and kills in a match (47).

Fall 2018, in Ann Arbor, 

Michigan 
— 
student 

population of 46,716 — Jones 
looked to prove herself as a 
freshman on a new stage, one 
much larger than ever before.

Now 
in 
2019, 
the 
star 

sophomore outside hitter has 
shown that her skills translate 
to the next level — and since 
her first start, she has just 
kept getting better.

For Jones, this process all 

began in fifth grade, when she 
started playing club volleyball. 
The club she joined was in 
Columbus — a three-hour 
round trip drive three times a 
week.

Fortunately, 
Jones’ 
hard 

work paid off, and it showed 
in her play. She was a menace 
on the court for opposing 
teams, and was already being 
recruited in her freshman year 
of high school.

Michigan 
didn’t 
begin 

recruiting Jones until her 
sophomore year, but by the 
end of it, she was committed.

“I came here for a visit and I 

just fell in love instantly with 
the campus,” Jones said. “It 
was not like any other campus 
that I visited. It was a true 
college town. I just felt like I 
was at home.”

***
Jones wasn’t as obvious 

a recruit as it may seem. At 
6-foot-1, she was undersized at 
her outside hitter position. It 
was a concern Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen took into account.

Rosen’s 
attention 
was 

turned toward her by his 
assistant coach Sean Byron 
and associate head coach/
recruiting coordinator Leisa 
Rosen — but Mark was still 
uneasy. 
Byron 
and 
Leisa 

had to approach the head 
coach, adamant about their 
judgement on Jones’ skill.

“Mark, you need to just 

go watch her for a whole 
day,” Byron and Leisa said, 
according to Mark. “Just go 
to a tournament and sit on 
her court. And just watch her. 
Don’t watch anybody else, just 
watch her.”

“So, 
I 
went 
to 
the 

tournament and I just sat down 
and I watched her,” Mark said. 
“And literally halfway through 
the day, I texted both of them 
and said we have to have this 
kid. She’s awesome.”

From then on, Michigan’s 

recruitment 
of 
Jones 
was 

aggressive because they knew 
how great a fit she would be.

“I think a lot of people 

missed on her,” Mark said. “I 
think probably a lot of people 
had that same inclination I 
did of, is she going to be big 
enough? And they didn’t take 
the time to go sit and watch 
her.”

Her ability to adapt — aided 

by her years playing track 
and basketball in addition to 
volleyball — certainly helped 

in her transition from high 
school to the Big Ten, one 
of college volleyball’s best 
conferences. The team was 
able to get in the gym early 
in the summer, helping Jones 
shift from high school to 
college play. But one of her 
most important assets in the 
transition 
was 
then-senior 

outside hitter Carly Skjodt. 
Jones was able to learn from 
her as a role model, on and off 
the court.

Jones went on to finish her 

freshman year with strong 
numbers. 
She 
ended 
the 

season with 402 kills — second 
most on the team, only behind 
Skjodt — and led the team with 
39 serving aces. 

But those are just numbers 

to Jones. Her main goal is to 
keep developing.

“I’m not the best I can be,” 

Jones said. “You can never 
really be the best that you can 
be. I just keep coming into the 
gym working hard every single 
day.”

Just like in high school, 

her effort has shown in her 
progress. This season, she 
leads the team with 303 kills 
and 30 serving aces, and she 
has 178 digs, 28 blocks and 14 
assists. But most notably, she’s 
improved her hit percentage. 
Jones ended her freshman 
year 
with 
a 
.195 
hitting 

percentage, not what the team 
was looking for at the outside 
hitter 
position. 
This 
year, 

she’s improved tremendously, 
hitting at .260 through 22 
games.

“She still gets kills like 

crazy, but her efficiency has 
gotten so much better,” Mark 
said. “She’s continued to get 
better.”

Jones is only in her second 

year as a Wolverine, but her 
skills and hard work offer a 
hint of how good she may be 
after two more years.

“I think she has the potential 

to be one of the best outside 
hitters in the country,” Mark 
said. “I wouldn’t really want to 
put any limits or expectations 
on her because I think she 
could be the best ever.

“Who knows?”
***
For Jones, success stems 

from her beginnings. And 
she believes it is of utmost 
importance to give back.

“Every single time I go 

home, I make sure to go 
into school, visit all my old 
teachers, 
visit 
the 
team,” 

Jones 
said. 
“Just 
making 

sure I go back to the roots 
where it all started and just 
get back. I think that’s super 
important. Because without 
them, without the people in 
the years prior, I wouldn’t be 

where I am today.”

Jones’ impact on New 

Bremen and its residents 
should not be understated. 
She puts in the time and 
effort to leave a positive 
influence on the town, and 
it shows.

“Everybody knows who 

Paige is, everybody wants 
to be like Paige. She’s just 
a great role model,” said 
Diana Kramer, her high 
school coach. “Not only do 
I still have a relationship 
with her, but she still has a 
relationship with my four 
kids, 
with 
everybody 
in 

town. Everybody loves to 
see her.”

Kramer goes on to tell 

a story about her second 
grade classroom. The kids 
were writing bio poems and 
the last line is “who dreams 
of”. A little girl in Kramer’s 

class wrote “who dreams 
of breaking Paige’s records 
playing volleyball.”

That’s the type of lasting 

impact Jones has left — a 
second 
grader, 
12 
years 

younger than Jones, wants 
to emulate her.

“She’s made an impression 

on a lot of people,” Kramer 
said. “She’s just a really good 
person. She cares deeply 
about people. She’s very, 
very 
humble. 
She’s 
very 

competitive, but she finds 
ways to make the people 
around her better people.”

Jones holds the town of 

New Bremen and its people 
dear to her. She puts in her 
time to visit and further 
develop 
the 
culture 
she 

helped foster. The town 
itself is definitely important 
to her, but what ties her to 
the town is something she 

holds closer to her heart 
than anything else — family.

She 
struggles 
to 
even 

explain how important they 
are to her, attributing a large 
part of her success to what 
her family has done for her 
and the time they’ve given 
up to help her. When asked 
about them, she is answering 
before the question is even 
finished.

To 
any 
observer, 
it’s 

obvious where her giving 
virtue comes from, and she 
carries her family’s values to 
this day.

Paige Jones left her mark 

at New Bremen, and now 
she’s well on her way to 
doing the same at Michigan. 
Her numbers are big and her 
leadership shows, but she 
knows she has even more left 
to give. All you need to do is 
just watch her.
