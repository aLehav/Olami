Katie Wolberg returned to 
campus after winter break filled 
with anticipation. As a second-
semester LSA freshman, she 
resolved to explore her developing 
interest in consulting, excited 
by the prospect of what joining 
a firm offered her: a network, a 
group of friends and a community 
at the University of Michigan. 
Despite Katie’s interest in data 
analytics and consulting, her 
anticipation quickly turned into 
disappointment when she was 
met with rejection at some of the 

top consulting clubs on campus, 
cutting short her opportunity to 
engage in this new atmosphere.
“I’m planning on transferring 
to the School of Information,” 
Wolberg said. “I’m interested in 
maybe consulting in the future, 
or doing something in the tech 
industry, and I thought [joining 
a club] would be a really good 
opportunity to meet new people 
and expand my network … and 
then it fell through and now I’m 
like, ‘Do I need to rethink what 
I’m doing?’”
Campus 
clubs 
and 
organizations are an integral 
part of the college experience. 

With more than 1,600 clubs at the 
University, students are afforded 
the opportunity to engage in a 
myriad of activities. 
But 
many 
pre-professional 
organizations require intensive 
application processes that make 
membership extremely exclusive. 
Competitive 
admissions 
are 
especially prevalent in business-
oriented, 
pre-professional 
organizations, 
including 
consulting groups, investment 
firms and business fraternities. 
Applications 
often 
require 
written supplements, interviews 
and multiple rounds of “cuts,” 
yielding an extensive process of 

new member selection.
A 
growing 
sentiment 
of 
frustration has developed among 
portions of the student body due 
to the highly selective nature 
of these clubs, which reject a 
majority of initial applicants 
before welcoming new members.
LSA junior Andrew Levey 
discussed 
how 
his 
own 
experience with rejection from a 
campus consulting firm led him 
to create Alliance Consulting 
Group, an organization dedicated 
to providing all students with 
an opportunity to learn about 
consulting.

Following 
temperature 
lows of -17 degrees Fahrenheit 
Wednesday 
and 
Thursday, 
numerous Ann Arbor tenants 
faced 
difficulties 
resulting 
from the inclement weather.
Several apartment buildings 
around 
campus 
contended 
with burst pipes and heating 
malfunctions Thursday due to 
the low temperatures. Varsity 
Ann 
Arbor, 
an 
apartment 
building on E. Washington 
Street 
largely 
housing 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students, dealt with these 
problems yesterday afternoon.
On Thursday at about 1 p.m., 
Varsity 
Management 
sent 
out an email to its tenants, 
stating that a water pipe had 
frozen and burst, leading to 
a fire alarm going off on the 
3rd floor of the apartments. 
Consequently, heating and hot 
water throughout the building 
was limited for much of the 
day.

MDining 
to start new 
emergency 
allergy plan

Coalition of faculty, students 
launch One University campaign

Addition of epinephrine auto injectors 
serve as aid for sensitive food allergies 

Initiative is an effort to spread resources fairly among three ‘U’ campuses

The 
One 
University 
Campaign, a coalition of faculty 
and 
students, 
launched 
last 
semester across the University of 

Michigan’s three campuses as an 
effort to equip the University’s 
Flint and Dearborn campuses 
with more resources. A key player 
in the campaign is sociology 
lecturer Ian Robinson, president 
of 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 
Organization. Robinson said the 
campaign has ideas in the works 

for where these resources should 
go and has the numbers to back 
them up.
“We 
are 
in 
many 
ways 
one university, and in many 
ways 
not,” 
Robinson 
said. 
“The 1U campaign is really, 
fundamentally 
an 
effort 
to 
get more resources for those 

campuses, and we have a number 
of different areas in which 
we think they’re lacking right 
now and which we have ideas 
on what might address those 
inadequacies and some numbers 
that prove where things are 
now.”

The University of Michigan’s 
College of Literature, Science and 
the Arts announced the formation 
of the Digital Studies Institute 
Monday. The Institute will expand 
the current minor degree program 
and provide students and faculty 
with greater resources, in addition 
to a new location on campus.
“LSA created the Digital Studies 
Institute to bring a humanities-
centered approach to the power 
and problems of the digital worlds 
billions of people visit and inhabit 
each day,” the press release reads. 
“The 
compelling, 
integrated 
coursework allows students to 
attain a degree with a more holistic 
and tech-savvy viewpoint on social 
and cultural issues.”
The Department of American 
Culture created the Digital Studies 
minor program in 2014. With 
only 20 students in its first year, 
the curriculum focused on the 
digital world and its history, as 
well as human interaction with 
technology. The program grew 
to more than 100 students by its 
second year and expanded to 
include a graduate program in 2016.

MDining decided to implement 
an emergency-use epinepherine 
program for fall of 2019 after a 
change in Michigan Legislation 
in 2015 allowing pharmacists 
to 
dispense 
auto-injectable 
epinephrine to an authorized 
entity. 
The epinephrine auto-injectors 
will be available as an emergency 
resource in all residential dining 
halls, according to a press release 
from the University of Michigan. 
MDining 
will 
partner 
with 
Housing security, a subunit of 
U-M Division of Public Safety & 
Security, which will have security 
officers 
patrolling 
residential 
areas, equipped with epinephrine 
auto-injectors.
According to the press release, 
a 2017 FDA report said there has 
been a 25 percent increase in 
allergy sensitive adults from 2007-
2017. The Journal of the American 
Medical 
Association 
found 
nearly 26 million adults have 
food allergies, and that number is 

growing.
MDining 
Dietitian 
Anne 
Smiarowski 
explained 
the 
implications of this research in 
the University press release.
“All 
research 
points 
to 
this number increasing for 
many reasons, including new 
additives and food processing 
that our bodies are not used 
to, as well as the possibility 
that we’ve become too clean,” 
Smiarowski said “The focus 
has been on making sure we use 
hand sanitizers, disinfectants, 
etc., everywhere in our life. 
Some 
studies 
suggest 
this 
has 
altered 
our 
immune 
system’s response to potential 
allergens.”
Kathryn Whiteside, Director 
of Systems Management for 
MDining, said the epinephrine 
program is not necessarily a 
response to a rise in allergy 
sensitive adults but to the 
recent legislation passed under 
the Public Act 221 of 2015 
 
that allows for authorized 
personnel on campus, including

Nuclear nonproliferation program 
will further research in the field 
The $25 million project will help prepare students to enter the security workforce

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
began 
spearheading 
a 
new 
$25 
million 
nuclear 
nonproliferation program 
earlier this year to further 
nuclear 
research 
and 
prepare students to join 
the 
nuclear 
security 
workforce. The program, 
called the Consortium for 
Monitoring, 
Technology 
and Verification, is part of 
the College of Engineering’s 
Detection 
for 
Nuclear 
Nonproliferation 
Group 
and will work with 13 
national laboratories and 
14 universities. The effort 
is being funded by the 
National Nuclear Security 
Administration.
The Consortium MTV 
program aims to further 
research in three primary 
areas, 
called 
“thrusts,” 
which 
include 
particle 
detection, 
discovering 
the 
locations 
of 
secret 
nuclear weapons facilities 

and monitoring the globe 
for 
nuclear 
explosions, 
connecting 
more 
than 
200 
graduate 
and 
undergraduate 
students 
with 
laboratories, 
internships 
and 
fellowships.
Engineering 
professor 
Sara 
Pozzi, 
founder 
of 
DNNG, 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
involving 
students in research.
“We 
can 
transition 
knowledge 
to 
students 
we are training and they 
can 
contribute 
to 
this 
important topic of nuclear 
nonproliferation 
and 
safeguarding,” Pozzi said. 
“We are providing a strong 
pipeline for the nuclear 
workforce in national labs, 
government and industry.”
The Consortium MTV 
will also provide funds 
for students to travel and 
attend graduate school.
Pozzi 
said 
she 
is 
particularly 
excited 
to 
be working with the Los 
Alamos 
National 
Lab, 
where the World War II-era 

Manhattan 
Project 
was 
conducted. The Manhattan 
Project was a research and 
development project led by 
the United States, with aid 
from the United Kingdom 
and Canada, which led to 
the creation of the first 
nuclear weapons. 
“Los Alamos has a long 
history going back to the 

Manhattan Project in 
the area of nuclear 
physics,” Pozzi said. 
“We’re working with 
some of the scientists 
at Los Alamos to delve 
into 
the 
physics 
of 
the 
fission 
project. 
We hope to deliver 
results 
and 
a 
new 
understanding of the 
fission process.”
Rackham 
student 
Michael Hua has been 
working 
with 
the 
Detection for Nuclear 
Nonproliferation 
Group since he was 
an undergraduate at 
the 
University. 
Hua 
stated he is currently 
interested in special 
nuclear 
materials, 
which 
can 
be 
used 
for clean energy or 
nuclear weapons. He 
said 
the 
University 
is a good place for 
students 
at 
both 
the 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
levels 
interested in nuclear 
technology.

“The 
University 
of 
Michigan is a fantastic 
research university and I 
think students at all levels 
should 
take 
advantage 
of 
our 
capabilities,” 
he 
said. 
“There 
are 
many 
reasons to research nuclear 
including 
fundamental 
science 
discoveries, 
developing public policy, 
and furthering what is a 
relatively young field of 
study. One of the biggest 
reasons is the ability to 
effect change, even at the 
undergraduate level.”
LSA 
senior 
Aditi 
Rajadhyaksha first became 
involved 
with 
nuclear 
research 
through 
the 
Undergraduate 
Research 
Opportunity Program her 
sophomore year. She said 
she has since developed a 
deep interest in the area 
and continued to research 
with DNNG.
“I joined the group my 
sophomore year and have 
been doing research in 
the 
group 
ever 
since,” 
Rajadhyaksha 
said. 
“I 
work 
on 
characterizing 
and 
improving 
the 
performance 
of 
organic 
scintillator 
detectors. 
Organic 
scintillator 
detectors detect nuclear 
radiation. They are used 
to detect the development 
of nuclear weapons and 
prevent nuclear terrorism.”
Rajadhyaksha said the 
funding and fellowships 
in the area of nuclear 
nonproliferation 
had 
a 
substantial 
influence 
on 
her 
undergraduate 
experience, as well as that 
of other students.
“(The 
fellowship) 
has 
given us the opportunity to 
make significant impacts 
in the field and gain useful 
research 
experience, 
ultimately 
allowing 
us 
and 
encouraging 
us 
to 
keep 
working 
in 
the 
field,” Rajadhyaksha said. 
“MTV will do the same 
for students like me who 
want to get involved in the 
field and work towards a 
safer world, free of nuclear 
proliferation.”

KATE JENKINS
Daily Staff Reporter


As 
Robinson 
noted, 
the 
campaign has a great deal of data at 
its disposal. According to Robinson, 
42 percent of U-M Dearborn and 
39 percent of U-M Flint students 
qualify for the Pell Grant, a federal 
grant awarded to high-achieving 
students with financial need, yet 
none are covered under the Go Blue 
Guarantee, the University’s offer 
of free tuition for in-state families 
with incomes under $65,000, 
because this is offered only to 
Ann Arbor students. None of the 
$85 million Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion funds go to the Dearborn 
and Flint campuses, despite a 
significant number of students of 
color.
The list of numbers goes on, 
and so do the ways these numbers 
manifest themselves in the daily 
and long-term operations of U-M 
Dearborn and Flint, according 
to members of the 1U campaign. 
These numbers and stories are 
the basis for 1U’s demands of the 
University.
The 1U coalition and campaign
Rackham 
student 
Corey 
Bowen, who works as an organizer 
for 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization, didn’t apply to the 
University of Michigan as a senior 
in high school. Hailing from a small 
town upstate, Ann Arbor didn’t 
seem like a place she could access 
 
at the time.
“I didn’t even apply to University 
of 
Michigan 
for 
undergrad,” 
Bowen said. “My perception was 
the University of Michigan is for 
wealthy, affluent families and not 
for rural communities.”
Now, as a graduate student here, 
Bowen is involved in 1U’s growing 
coalition. Her interest in this work 
spurred from her experience with 

GEO bargaining in 2017 when 
she said the University wouldn’t 
budge on equal pay for graduate 
student instructors across the 
three campuses, even when other 
progressive changes were made.
She sees this issue, among others 
1U advocates for, as a question 
of the University’s values and an 
example of what 1U calls an “unfair 
silo system” budget model used by 
University administrators, which 
hurts the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses.
For 
Bowen 
and 
other 
1U 
organizers, disparities across the 
University system are noticeable. 
1U has specifically listed the Go 
Blue Guarantee’s lack of extension 
to Flint and Dearborn, Flint and 
Dearborn not receiving any of the 
$85 millionearmarked for DEI over 
five years nor any of the $1 billion in 
funding for student support from 
the Victors For Michigancampaign 
and Flint and Dearborn lecturers 
being paid less than Ann Arbor, 
while 1U research shows workloads 
are 30-50 percent greater for Flint 
and Dearborn lecturers, as issues 
the campaign hopes to address.
Dan 
Birchok, 
an 
assistant 
professor of anthropology at U-M 
Flint is also working on 1U. He 
said many of his coworkers notice 
the issues 1U raises. There is also 
widespread concern, Birchok said, 
among faculty about the future 
of the Flint campus if the current 
level of monetary support from the 
University continues.
“There’s been a large cross-
section of interest from across 
the U-M Flint campus, and that 
appears to only be growing as we 
talk more and circulate what’s 
going on,” Birchok said. “These are 
all people who are invested in the 
institution and who fear if we don’t 
solve this problem then the already 
dire situation there will be worse, 
then we won’t be able to support 

our students.”
The overarching goals of the 
campaign include addressing a 
budget model the group believes 
perpetuates inequality among the 
three campuses. They also seek to 
press the University and state of 
Michigan to allocate more funding 
and resources to the Dearborn and 
Flint campuses.
According to Robinson, 1U’s 
goals are complex and made for 
long-term achievement. Currently, 
the coalition focuses on spreading 
their message across the three 
campuses ahead of the June 2019 
budget deadlines for both the 
University and state of Michigan.
Robinson said some of the points 
of the campaign are still undecided 
because as a large coalition, all 
parts of the group need to decide on 
priorities. He also said the coalition 
has begun communicating with 
members of the state legislature 
and University Board of Regents 
and will continue talking with 
decision-makers until the budget 
deadlines.
“A kind of fundamental shift to a 
vision of what we should be doing 
— that puts our three campuses on 
a more equal footing — is a long-
term project, but there is a sort 
of immediate target, which is the 
budgets,” Robinson said. “Part of 
the reason we’re building a big 
coalition is because it’s not going 
to be easy, but … we’re cautiously 
optimistic that we can make real 
progress.”
To do this, the coalition has 
held community forums and tables 
on all three campuses, circulated 
leaflets and created a listserv to 
build a support base. Going into 
winter semester, Robinson said the 
campaign is planning to increase 
its outreach efforts.
Lia Fabbri, a student on the 
Dearborn campus who joined 1U 
to address inequities she’s noticed 

on her campus, said one of her 
challenges is making 1U and its 
campaign points known to other 
U-M Dearborn students.
“I think a lot of people come to 
school and get their education and 
they go home, which is fine, but 
I think people need to realize — 
need to be shown — there are these 
issues we can be fighting for and 
that they will directly impact our 
education and make our experience 
at this University a better one,” 
Fabbri said. “It does sometimes feel 
that we’re secondary, that we’re 
forgotten, that we’re the end of 
the list where resources are being 
allocated.”
How 
the 
discrepancies 
1U 
claims are reflected
Studying abroad is popular on 
the Ann Arbor campus, with a 
plethora of opportunities within 
the University and non-University 
programs offered. Funding is 
available through the Office of 
Financial Aid, as well as through a 
variety of University scholarships. 
Birchok is involved with helping 
students go abroad through the 
International and Global Studies 
Program at U-M Flint. Birchok 
explained Flint students face a 
number of obstacles when trying 
to apply to these trips and the 
program office doesn’t have the 
funds to overcome them.
“For our around 40-percent Pell 
Grant students, for those students 
to take a two-week trip overseas, 
for them to have to pay for their 
trip but then in many cases lose the 
opportunity cost of not being able 
to work during that time, some of 
our students have children or are 
responsible for children, there’s 
a lot of hidden costs for them,” 
Birchok said. 

dining staff and housing security 
officers, to possess epinephrine.
“In the past, our position 
on epinephrine and having it 
available in the unit was we 
did not have a way of procuring 
epinephrine because prior to 
some 
recent 
legislation, 
we 
couldn’t purchase it,” Whiteside 
said. “Recently the legislation 
changed in the state of Michigan 
and it became possible for us 
to get a prescription that is 
associated with the organization, 
not with an individual, and that 
would allow us to get epipens 
and get them in our first aid kits...
We’ve had students asking for us 
to be able to do this for years and 
we weren’t legally able to.”
Whiteside 
said 
personnel 
authorized 
to 
administer 
the 
epipen 
have 
undergone 
appropriate training.
“The 
professional 
dining 
staff, the management teams in 
the dining hall, have taken the 
red cross training for how to 
administer an epipen,” Whiteside 
said.
Whiteside said she hopes 
access to the program will 
eventually expand to more of 
the student body. There will 
potentially 
be 
epinephrine 
available at student recreation 
centers and other locations in the 
event that a student experiences 
a delayed food allergy reaction.
Whiteside 
said 
college 
students are more likely to take 
risks while trying foods despite 
known allergies, one of the 
reasons the University sought to 
implement the new epinephrine 
program. Food Allergy Research 
& Education stated teenagers and 
young adults are a population at 
the highest risk of experiencing 
fatal food-induced anaphylaxis.
“The percent of the population 
we 
see, 
they 
are 
adults,” 
Whiteside said. “As adults they 
are responsible for themselves, 
but also the age group that 
we see are the population of 
individuals that take the most 
risks when managing their own 
food allergies.”
Whiteside said the emergency 
epinephrine 
program 
is 
important 
to 
maintain 
the 
safety of students because many 
people do not know they have a 
food allergy and can experience 
a severe reaction. According 
to 
FARE, 
approximately 
20-25 percent of epinephrine 
administrations 
in 
schools 
involve individuals who were 
unaware of their allergy at the 

time of the reaction.
“There’s a large percentage 
of the population that doesn’t 
know they have a food allergy 
and could have an anaphylactic 
reaction and not even know it at 
that point, not even know that 
they have an allergy,” Whiteside 
said. “And the percentage of that 
population is high enough that 
we felt like it was a win win for 
us to have epipens available.”
Whiteside 
explained 
the 
immediate procedure to deal 
with an anaphylactic reaction to 
a food allergy prior to the auto-
injection program was to call 911.
“Up until we had the epipens 
available, that would be our 
standard 
safety 
procedure,” 
Whiteside said. “You call for 
assistance immediately.”
In 
addition 
to 
the 
new 
epinephrine 
auto-injectors, 
the University has worked to 
accommodate students with food 
allergies in the past using online 
databases to present nutritional 
and allergen facts. Ingredient 
information can be found on 
digital menus throughout dining 
halls, physical signage, websites 
and mobile apps which include 
allergen information for all food 
served in residential dining halls 
and catered campus events.
The 
MDining 
website 
“MyNutrition” allows students 
to filter menus for the some of 
the most most common allergens 
such as eggs, fish, milk and 
peanuts, as well as gluten-free, 
halal, spicy, vegan and vegetarian 
options. According to the press 
release, MyNutrition displays all 
ingredients for every single item 
found in the dining hall.
“On MyNutrition you can 
actually read the ingredients like 
you would on a label in a grocery 
store,” Whiteside said.
A disclaimer is provided on the 
MyNutrition site states accuracy

“The University of Michigan

The minor in Digital Studies 
is available to all students, and, 
according 
to 
DSI 
Coordinator 
Lisa Nakamura, a professor of 
American culture, many students 
in the past have used the minor as a 
complement to their studies.
“A lot of our minors were in 
communications or film, but we 
also had minors in the School of 
Engineering, or minors in the 
Information School,” Nakamura 
said. “(Students) said, ‘In my 
engineering classes, I learn how to 
make technology, but in my digital 
studies classes, I learn why I make 
technology.’”
LSA sophomore Ellie Metni is 
majoring in history and political 
science and pursuing the minor 
in digital studies. Metni was 
interested in the program because 
of its integrative nature that bridges 
politics 
and 
technology 
with 
aspects of communications and 
social media. Metni believes even 
more students would be interested 
in the program if they expanded the 
curriculum to form a major.
“It seems like a really good 
intersection 
of 
things 
like 
communications and (sociology), 
and film and American culture,” 
Metni said. “If they made it a major, 
and it would be super appealing 
to students who are into multiple 
topics.”
The Digital Studies Institute will 
be the first of its kind in the United 
States, as mentioned on its website. 
The institute will provide students 
and faculty with opportunities for 
research, primarily focused on the 
intersections of technology and 
human identity, but also focused on 
digital culture and art.
The requirements for the digital 
studies minor remain the same, and 
many faculty members from the 
American Culture Department and 
across the University are joining the 

effort to bring various resources to 
one central location. The ultimate 
goal of the DSI is to make students 
more aware of the minor by giving 
the program a name and location on 
campus. According to Nakamura, 
some students didn’t know the 
program existed and wished they 
knew about it while they were 
undergraduates.
“There may have been students 
who were really interested in this,” 
Nakamura said. “I’ve had a student 
who graduated say, ‘I want to come 
back and get this degree.’”
Ann Arbor has continued to 
gain momentum as a top location 
to study technology in the country, 
earning itself a reputation as a hub 
for start-up companies. The Google 
Ads program has a secondary 
office in Ann Arbor, and successful 
technology companies like Duo 
Security were started in the city. 
This adds to the appeal of the new 
Digital Studies Institute, because 
resources are available both on 
and off campus to connect with 
leaders in the tech industry in 
ways unparalleled to the rest of the 
nation.
Plans for the Digital Studies 
Institute are underway, with hopes 
to incorporate research regarding 
both the positive and negative 
effects of technology into their 
overall mission. Anne Curzan, 
associate dean for the humanities 
in LSA, is looking forward to 
connecting the University with 
experts around the world through 
the growing resources the DSI will 
provide.
“There 
are 
important 
ethical questions in play as new 
technologies emerge,” Curzan said 
in an email interview with The 
Daily. “We are excited that the 
researchers at the Digital Studies 
Institute will be positioned to 
respond quickly and be part of 
national and global conversations 
about the design and impact of 
these technologies.”

“I tried to become interested 
in the consulting industry in 
the beginning of my sophomore 
year,” Levey said. “I applied to a 
lot of the Ross consulting clubs 
to see if I could learn about the 
industry and get some real-world 
experience doing so, and I found 
that these clubs are really, really 
hard to get into if you don’t know 
anything about what’s called a case 
interview.”
In a case interview, an applicant 
is presented with a hypothetical 
business 
scenario 
that 
the 
interviewee 
must 
assess 
and 
propose a solution to. Consulting 
clubs often utilize this interview 
style to assess potential members.
Levey went on to discuss how 
Alliance Consulting combats a 
culture of exclusivity by focusing 
on new member education and 
developing skills for consulting, 
including how to complete a 
successful case interview.
“I thought it was unfair that 
people who don’t know about an 
industry are assessed on a learned 
skill they don’t know,” Levey said. 
“I felt that there needed to be a club 
on campus for students who, even if 
they don’t know what consulting is, 
if they want to become interested 
in it, they can have the opportunity 
to do so.” 
Business junior Thejas Suvarna, 
president of APEX Consulting 
Group, one of the most selective 
consulting groups, stated that in an 
effort to provide all students with 

an equal opportunity to succeed 
in the recruitment process, case 
interview workshops are held 
to explain what they are and 
provide applicants with examples 
of how to approach problems. 
APEX Consulting Group focuses 
on offering pro-bono consulting 
for local Ann Arbor businesses 
and is known to have selective 
membership.
“At the end of the day, we really 
emphasize that while there’s a 
formal name to this case interview, 
really it’s just a way to gauge your 
thought process and see how you 
break down a problem, and those 
are inherent traits people will 
have,” Suvarna said.
“We do so much work with 
clients and we have to manage 
those relationships,” Suvarna said. 
“Clients give us their personal 
information. We have to make sure 
that we’re respecting their privacy 
and serving them a purpose and 
doing a good job, and it’s not feasible 
for us to do that well with a club 
that’s too big for us to manage.”
Suvarna went on to discuss the 
firm’s applicant selection process 
is based on anonymity to ensure a 
more holistic process at large.
“Our application process is 
completely anonymous,” Suvarna 
said. “We go through and read the 
responses to our essays because, for 
us, what is most important is, ‘Did 
these people do their homework 
and learn about what APEX has to 
offer? Is there a legitimate reason 
that they want to be in APEX, 
to contribute to the community 
rather than to just use it as a step 
to the next thing?’ That all comes 

first.”
Ed Huebner, assistant director 
of Counseling and Psychological 
Services, noted the positive aspects 
of selective clubs, as they instill a 
strong sense of community among 
members within a large campus.
“I think the idea goes back to 
connection and feeling a sense 
of belonging — and that could be 
belonging to a group, a club, an 
organization or a department,” 
Huebner said. “There’s a sense of 
identity that can come from feeling 
like, ‘This is my group, this is my 
connection, these are my people, 
and from that there’s a closeness 
that we feel.’”
Huebner discussed how the 
feeling of belonging contributes 
to the mental health of students 
on campus, both positively and 
negatively.
“For a lot of our students that 
come in, this can be a very big 
place,” Huebner said. “So that idea 
of, ‘Who can I connect with and feel 
belonging with?’ on campus ends 
up being a really big factor when it 
comes to their mental health.”
Norm Bishara, the associate 
dean for undergraduate programs 
at the Ross School of Business, 
provided an email statement on 
behalf of the Business School 
discussing how success on a college 
campus goes beyond admission to 
any one organization.
“The clubs provide benefits to 
students by creating opportunities 
for 
leadership 
and 
real-world 
experiences, offering fellowship 
and a like-minded community, 
and creating positive impact,” 
Bishara wrote in the email. “… 

We recognize that the student 
leaders 
of 
some 
clubs 
have 
implemented 
competitive 
application processes. While clubs 
and student organizations are an 
important part of the Michigan 
Ross experience, student success is 
independent of participation in any 
single club or activity on campus.”
Business junior Jack Geiger, vice 
president of clubs for the Bachelor 
of 
Business 
Administration 
Council, 
said 
the 
competitive 
nature of business-oriented clubs 
is appropriate, given the rigorous 
work students participate in once 
admitted.
“I think for the most part it’s 
justified, based on the fact that a 
lot of these clubs are operating as 
businesses in a way,” Geiger said. 
“A lot have clients and will be 
managing funds where it definitely 
makes sense to have a merit-based 
application process.”
Geiger went on to discuss how a 
small club environment is beneficial 
to students, as it resembles the 
competitiveness of the professional 
world and prepares students for the 
future.
“Business school in general is a 
pretty competitive environment 
and I think the point of that is to 
prepare you for the real world, 
which is the next step in everyone’s 
process,” Geiger said. “So, as we 
recruit for jobs or are applying 
for internships, it’s obviously very 
selective. … I think having a mini-
environment when joining clubs is 
beneficial because it prepares you 
for what you can expect in the real 
world.”

Effectively addressing climate change

ANIK JOSHI | COLUMN

E

nvironmentally-friend-
ly policies have tradi-
tionally been associated 
with more liberal 
politicians. This has 
stayed 
somewhat 
consistent 
— 
the 
first hearings on cli-
mate change were 
held by former Rep. 
Al Gore Jr. in 1976 
and 
today, 
from 
much news cover-
age, it seems that 
the progressive left 
is the only group 
trying to seriously address 
anthropogenic global warm-
ing.
However, this is far from 
the case. There are a number 
of policies that can effectively 
address climate change that 
do not receive the support that 
they should from the left. I 
want to focus on two of these— 
nuclear energy and carbon 
capture.
Nuclear energy is a policy 
that does not have much sup-
port because there is a large 
amount of fear of another 
nuclear disaster like Fuku-
shima in Japan. However, this 
is unfounded. As Bill Gates 
wrote in his end-of-year letter 
for 2018, “Nuclear is ideal for 
dealing with climate change, 
because it is the only carbon-
free, scalable energy source 
that’s available 24 hours a day. 
The problems with today’s 
reactors, such as the risk 
of accidents, can be solved 
through innovation.”
Nuclear energy is clearly 
a net positive and one would 
hope that more plants would 
be opened. However, this is 
not happening and nuclear 
plants are being unnecessar-
ily shuttered. As of 2016, the 
amount of energy lost by clos-
ing five nuclear plants was 
almost equivalent to all solar 
energy in the United States. 
This leaves a gap that must be 
filled, and what tends to fill it 
is natural gas and other, dirtier 
sources of energy. Per the Rho-
dium Group, “over 75% of the 
lost generation from at-risk 
nukes would be replaced by 

fossil generation, largely from 
natural gas combined cycle 
(NGCC) power plants.” Swap-
ping out a zero-
emissions 
source 
for 
natural 
gas 
seems foolish and 
the exact opposite 
of what those who 
were interested in 
actually addressing 
carbon 
emissions 
would do and yet 
here we are.
Carbon emissions 
trading is one of the 
most efficient ways to reduce 
carbon put into the atmo-
sphere. The way it would work 
is there would be a set num-
ber of carbon credits and they 
would be distributed among 
firms. Each would have a cer-
tain number of carbon credits 
— allowing the owner to pro-
duce a certain amount of car-
bon. If a firm was to run out, 
they would then be allowed 

to purchase additional credits 
from those who have not used 
their credits.
The reason the progressive 
groups who put together the 
Green New Deal are opposed 
to this is that if a company 
needs to purchase more cred-
its, the cost would probably 
be passed on to the consumer 
and they disagree with this. 
They think that the company 
alone should have to shoulder 
the burden. However, this is 
unfair. If a person is buying 
something that takes extra 
carbon to produce, from a fair-
ness standpoint, why should 
they be exempt from the bur-
den?
The policy that both would 
have the biggest impact on 

carbon emissions in the U.S. 
and has the biggest chance of 
passing is a carbon tax. In the 
last Congress, a bipartisan car-
bon tax bill was introduced 
in the Senate by Sen. Chris 
Coons, D-Del., and former 
Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. This 
was similar to the bill intro-
duced in the House, which 
was also done in a bipartisan 
manner featuring moderate 
Republicans and Democrats 
from all over the country. 
Per the Washington Exam-
iner, should the House bill 
become law, the bill’s authors 
say it would “reduce U.S. car-
bon emissions 45 percent by 
2030 compared to 2015 levels, 
and 80 to 90 percent by 2050, 
well beyond the pace of the 
Obama administration’s target 
under the Paris climate agree-
ment that President Trump 
rejected.” There is agreement 
across the spectrum on this 
— every living chair of the 
Council of Economic Advis-
ers, every living chair of the 
Federal Reserve and a number 
of Nobel Economic laureates 
signed an open letter in the 
Wall Street Journal calling for 
exactly this.
Climate change is happen-
ing and the window to do 
something is closing quickly. 
There needs to be large-scale 
decarbonization and two of 
the main methods of doing so 
(carbon capture and nucle-
ar energy) are specifically 
denounced in the Green New 
Deal which is supposed to be a 
plan for large-scale decarbon-
ization. Carbon taxes are also 
not as popular as solar or wind 
energy. In the 48-page PDF, 
the phrase “carbon tax” is only 
mentioned three times and not 
one of them discusses what a 
reasonable number would be. 
Addressing climate change 
is something that can only be 
done in a bipartisan manner 
and I hope that cooler heads 
prevail over this political dis-
pute.

MARIA ULAYYET | COLUMN

W

ho 
would’ve 
thought such a sim-
ple, everyday ques-
tion could trigger so much 
anxiety and dread?

Hi, my name is Maria. 

Pronounced 
MAH-ree-ya 
— 

not 
mah-REE-ya. 
Taking 
it 

upon myself to correct the 

pronunciation of my name is 

my way of reclaiming both 

my narrative and my identity. 

And it’s about time my fellow 

uniquely named individuals did 

so as well.

When my parents, Fahed and 

Nour, immigrated to America 

in the 1980s from Syria, they 

faced a lot of prejudice. From 

their 
“strange 
accents” 
to 

their 
“weird 
names,” 
they 

continuously felt out of place. 

Soon enough, in a professional 

space, Fahed became Fred and 

Nour became Nora.

Though 
my 
parents 

cherished the beauty and depth 

of the Arabic language and 

culture, they never wanted their 

kids to feel the same isolation 

and alienation they once felt. 

Out of love and protection, they 

gave me and my three siblings 

“hybrid” names. At home, I was 

Maria (MAH-ree-ya) but at 

school or sports practice, I was 

Maria (mah-REE-ya).

A quick Google search on 

“changing your name to get 

a job” will reveal a plethora 

of 
articles 
and 
studies 

regarding the effects of “name-

whitening.” The “whiter” your 

name sounds, the more likely 

you are to fit a certain image 

and gain better opportunities 

such as a higher-paying job.

My 
parents 
weren’t 

crazy to think that a little 

bit of accommodation would 

translate to a lifetime of easier 

and simpler interactions.

While this may seem like 

such a small inconvenience, 

what 
my 
parents 
once 

did 
to 
safeguard 
me 
from 

discrimination, 
inevitably 

served as the erasure of my Arab 

identity that I proudly carry. 

The concoction of my fair skin, 

my light brown hair and my 

name all give me a very white-

passing identity. While I can’t 

deny the social advantages this 

may have given me throughout 

my life, I never wanted to hide 

my true self behind this facade.

Throughout middle school 

and high school, I switched 

between the “white” version 

of my name and the “Arab” 

version. Should I settle for the 

ease of a quick introduction 

or play a game of trial-and-

error for the sake of a “proper” 

greeting. For most of my life, if 

we were close, I was MAH-ree-

ya. If we weren’t, I was mah-

REE-ya.

The duality of my name 

contributed to this “double-

agent” feeling I grew up with 

and 
carried 
with 
me 
into 

adulthood.

The reality is our names 

carry a lot of meaning. The 

first 
impression. 
The 
first 

semblance to who we are. 

Freshman year of college, I 

switched between Maria and 

Maria, Maria and Maria. It took 

until now, the second semester 

of my sophomore year to start 

correcting 
my 
professors 

when they take roll in class. 

To formally introduce myself 

to everyone I meet the “right” 

way. To stop minimizing the 

beauty of my unique name for 

the sake of easing it for other 

people.

The assumptions we make 

on a daily basis solely on the 

grounds of someone’s name 

signal 
the 
extreme 
bigotry 

we face today as a society in 

modern America. While we 

pride ourselves on being a 

melting pot nation of people 

from any and every background 

imaginable, 
the 
landscape 

of our society is far from 

reflecting such an idea. With 

the rise of an emphasis on 

diversity and inclusion, it is 

time to end this trend of white-

washing and Americanization 

for the sake of fitting in.

For now, I will do my part 

and continue to use the correct 

pronunciation of my name to 

highlight the beauty of where I 

come from.

“Hey, what’s your name?”

D

uring the 2016 presiden-
tial campaign, then-can-
didate Hillary Clinton 
proclaimed that sin-
gle-payer healthcare 
will “never, ever” 
happen, 
citing 
its 
impracticality. 
Despite Clinton’s vic-
tory over progressive 
standard-bearer Sen. 
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
in the primary, Dem-
ocrats have made a 
stunning lurch to the 
left on health care 
and a whole other host of issues 
since the 2016 election. Only 
three years after Clinton sound-
ly rejected single-payer health 
care, support for a Medicare-for-
all single-payer health care plan 
has swept into the Democratic 
mainstream. A large part of the 
surge in support for single-payer 
health care is because of support 
from young people, especially 
students.
Contrary to talking points 
from some conservatives, youth 
support for single-payer health 
care isn’t the result of our gen-
eration’s laziness and desire for 
“free stuff.” Instead, it’s because 
our current health care system 
is so exorbitantly expensive 
that young people simply can-
not afford healthcare. In fact, 
an NPR study found that more 
than 40 percent of those under 
35 have had trouble paying for 
health care. As a result, young 
people are forced to choose 
between taking care of their 
health, paying back student 
loans and covering basic new-
cessities. In the United States, 
that’s unacceptable.
The American Dream is the 
idea that if you get an education 
and work hard, you’ll be able to 
live comfortably and pass on a 
better life to the next generation. 
Our leaders in Washington, of 
both parties, have fallen short by 
allowing the American Dream 
to fade from reality. In bringing 
Washington’s failure to secure 
quality, affordable health care 
for the American people to the 
forefront, youth activists are 
doing a service to our nation. 
Despite their noble intentions, 
however, single-payer health 
care isn’t the answer. Beyond its 
enticing title, there’s no coherent 
plan behind Medicare-for-all 
other than the wholesale gov-
ernment takeover of the Ameri-
can health care system. Any 
hasty embrace of a European-
style government takeover of 
our health care system would 
have catastrophic effects on 
Americans’ physical well-being 
and the nation’s economy.
First and foremost, a move to 

single-payer health care would 
force millions of Americans to 
abandon their private health 
care plans in favor of 
government-rationed 
care. 
Earlier 
this 
week, Sen. Kamala 
Harris, D-Calif., a 
Democratic 
presi-
dential 
candidate, 
kicked off her cam-
paign saying, “We 
need to have Medi-
care-for-all” 
and 
that she feels “very 
strongly” about the 
issue. When asked what would 
happen to the private health 
insurance plans nearly 136.5 
million adult Americans under 
65 rely on, Harris said, “Let’s 
eliminate all of that. Let’s move 
on.”
At the very least, one has to 
appreciate 
Harris’s 
honesty 
about her dreadful ideas on 
health care. Instead of emulat-
ing President Obama by falsely 
promising the American people, 
“If you like your health care 
plan, you can keep it,” Harris is 
admitting from the outset that 
her plan would take away health 
care from those Americans on 
private insurance. Instead of 
providing Americans with a 
choice regarding their own well-
being, Harris and other support-
ers of single-payer health care 
would replace the patient-insur-
ance company relationship with 
big government.
One doesn’t have to look fur-
ther than the Veterans Affairs 
Administration to see the bleak 
results of single-payer govern-
ment-rationed care. When given 
the task of providing veterans 
with quality health care, the 
government allowed the VA’s 
“waiting lists” for care. In 2015 
alone, more than 200 veterans 
died while waiting for care at the 
VA facility in Phoenix. One can 
only shudder thinking of all the 
needless suffering our veterans 
went through while waiting for 
care. The government’s failure 
to care for our nation’s heroes 
is a national disgrace. Given the 
grim results at the VA, it would 
be a profound mistake to expand 
the VA’s single-payer model of 
government-rationed care to 
our entire healthcare system 
with Medicare-for-all.
Beyond the grave conse-
quences Medicare-for-all would 
have on our national health, it 
would also prove debilitating 
to our economy. According to 
the Mercatus Center, Bernie 
Sanders’s Medicare for All Act 
would add $32.6 trillion to the 
federal budget in the first 10 
years of its implementation. In 
order to even attempt to pay for 

this, Emory University professor 
Kenneth Thorpe, a former Clin-
ton administration official, esti-
mates the government would 
have to implement historically 
high taxes. Thorpe estimates 
that the total tax burden result-
ing from Medicare-for-all would 
equal 20 percent of the national 
payroll and cause 70 percent of 
working households to pay more 
in taxes.
These 
astronomical 
tax 
increases resulting from Medi-
care-for-all 
would 
put 
the 
American Dream even further 
out of reach for the vast major-
ity of working Americans. Even 
Sanders’s home state of Vermont 
rejected Medicare-for-all after 
initial enthusiasm when the 
crushing fiscal realities set in. 
The rest of the country ought 
to join Sanders’s home state in 
rejecting such damaging poli-
cies.
However, we cannot allow 
Washington to continue abdi-
cating its responsibility to build 
a health care system that works 
for all Americans. For an issue 
as momentous as health care, 
Washington must work togeth-
er for an American solution — 
not a Republican or Democratic 
one. Going forward, we need to 
improve our health care system 
so that it provides quality care at 
low costs while covering those 
with pre-existing conditions. 
Addressing the opioid crisis is 
also a must.
This task is undoubtedly lofty 
for a government that is unable 
to come together even to fund 
basic services. However, it’s pos-
sible if Washington starts with 
common sense issues that most 
Americans agree on, regardless 
of party. For example, remov-
ing regulations that prevent 
Americans from purchas-
ing insurance across state 
lines and small businesses 
from pooling together to 
buy insurance would go a 
long way in boosting com-
petition, which would likely 
lower prices and improve 
quality. 
In 
implementing 
these bipartisan reforms, 
Washington would show its 
ability to bring back some 
much-needed 
bipartisan 
common sense to politics. 
The future of the Ameri-
can Dream for generations 
to come depends on Wash-
ington’s ability to reject 
extreme 
proposals 
like 
Medicare-for-all in favor of 
common-sense reforms.

Climate change 
is happening and 
the window to 
do something is 
closing quickly.


The first two days of the 2019 
Sundance Film Festival felt a lot 
like the first two days of college. 
I was alone in an intimidating, 
new environment, surrounded by 
people I didn’t know, struggling 
to acclimate to a tight routine and 
figure out how to get from place 
to place. As someone in their final 
semester, I found this change to be 
especially jarring. But as the days 
went by, the Sundance experience 
slowly became less about trying to 
fit in with the festival’s esteemed 
guests and more about what the 
festival was really focused on: a 
celebration of independent cinema.
Sundance kicked off its first 
string of premieres on Thursday 
evening. 
That 
first 
night, 
I 
embarked to the press screening 
for “Native Son,” and though the 
film itself wasn’t the best way to 
start the festival — as you’ll read 
about in my review below — the 
palpable air of excitement from 
fellow cinephiles and critics was 
exhilarating. Making conversation 
is the first big step in ingratiating 
yourself into the Sundance culture, 
a challenge I pushed myself to 
prevail against by chatting with the 
woman in front of me in the line for 
“Native Son,” who just so happened 
to be a Michigan alumna. Amazing 
how a festival as big as this can still 
feel like a small world. 
The 
following 
morning, 
I 
ventured to two equally captivating 
panels, the first being an interview 
moderated by the Jewish Film 
Institute with filmmaker Matt 
Tyraneur, 
who 
discussed 
in 
comprehensive detail his riveting 
documentary 
“Where’s 
My 
Roy Cohn?,” and the second a 
wonderful, important conversation 
on advancing inclusion in the film 
industry, conducted by The Black 
List creator Franklin Leonard. 
With hours to kill before my second 
and third screenings of the festival 
— “Share” and “Give Me Liberty” 
— I explored the downtown area of 
Park City, where crowds of people 

bundled in expensive jackets, boots, 
scarves and beanies shuffled about.
Over the course of these busy 
24 hours, I learned very quickly 
that Sundance isn’t as scary as I 
thought it would be. Sure, there 
were plenty of folks who looked 
like they could destroy me if I met 
their eyeline, knowing immediately 
that I was a novice. But I had to 
remember that everyone is here for 
the same reason, that learning the 
tricks of the trade is second-hand 
to the jittery anticipation of seeing 
a movie for the first time.

‘Native Son’:

With the recent critical and 
commercial successes of “Get Out,” 
“BlacKkKlansman” and “Sorry to 
Bother You,” social allegory cinema 
is in high demand. Young audiences 
are craving stories that can unspool 
the intricate web of social conflicts 
plaguing our society, with the 
hopes that current issues like 
race relations, gentrification and 
microaggressions can make us 
think deeper and give us some 
sense of clarity about how to 
combat the systemic nature of such 
problems.
“Native Son,” first-time director 
Rashid Johnson’s daring, disjointed 
adaptation of Richard Wright’s 
1940 novel, is one such story 
that tries so desperately to say 
something, anything, important 
about modern-day racism and class 
divides. And while the film has all 
the right pieces — timely themes, 
gorgeous visuals, an A24 stamp and 
a refreshingly diverse young cast — 
none of these elements coalesce 
into a tale that you can sink your 
teeth into. Even the modernized 
update of Wright’s book, while 
certainly ambitious, fails to wring 
out any new insight from its source 
material.
Segmented into three chapters 
— “Fate, “Fear” and “Flight” — 
“Native Son” revolves around 
Bigger Thomas (Ashton Sanders, 
“The Equalizer 2”), a green-haired, 
black-nailed loner who receives 
a lifetime opportunity working 

as a chauffeur and caretaker for 
an affluent white family in the 
suburbs of Chicago. The light-
hearted first act, “Fate,” presents 
a promising start, immersing us in 
Bigger’s fragmented world through 
his love of punk rock, his strained 
relationship with his mother Trudy 
(Sanaa Lathan, “Nappily Ever 
After”), his rowdy friends and his 
high-maintenance girlfriend Bessie 
(Kiki Layne, “If Beale Street Could 
Talk”).
All that dramatic momentum, 
however, loses steam when the 
second act, “Fear,” kicks in. The 
coming-of-age undertones slowly 
evaporate into a dread-induced 
thriller when Bigger begins to 
service the Daltons, a family whose 
socioeconomic bubble and all-
too-harmless demeanor bring to 
mind the creepy antagonists from 
“Get Out.” Even more disturbing 
is Bigger’s connection with his 
employer’s 
rebellious 
teenage 
daughter Mary (Margaret Qualley, 
“The Leftovers”), a social justice 
warrior 
with 
good 
intentions 
but prone to making problematic 
assumptions 
about 
Bigger’s 
attitudes and interests.
Discomfort is to be expected 
when narrative and all-too-relevant 
subject matter collide, though 
in the case of “Native Son,” the 
discomfort is rooted in the jarring 
tonal shifts, plodding pacing and 
surface-level 
characterizations. 
These issues are no more realized 
than during a late second act twist 
so horrific and viscerally alarming, 
it elicited a bevy of anxious groans 
from the audience at my screening.
Though “Native Son” remains 
a distinct entry in the social 
allegory 
canon, 
the 
parallels 
with the aforementioned films 
are undeniable. It evokes the 
white-liberal guilt of “Get Out,” 
the 
provocative 
undercurrents 
of “BlacKkKlansman” and the 
surreal satire of “Sorry to Bother 
You.” But compared to those 
far more superior takes on the 
complex interplay between race, 
class and power, “Native Son” 
remains muddled and unfocused 

in its messaging. Through a series 
of poetic narrations by Bigger and 
some vague symbolism, the film 
suggests that blindness toward 
our own actions creates dire 
consequences for ourselves and for 
others, an idea that could have been 
intriguing had it not been for its 
flimsy execution.
There are, of course, a few 
instances in “Native Son” that 
save it from falling completely flat 
on its face. The fleeting moments 
of levity peppered throughout 
the film soften the ebb and flow 
of tension, especially during one 
early comical scene involving a rat 
that interrupts a family breakfast. 
Matthew 
Libatique’s 
reliable 
cinematography is as sharp as ever, 
amplifying the soft blues of Bigger’s 
bedroom walls and the orange tints 
of a house party.
Sanders is also a marvel to 
watch. Fresh from his breakout 
role in 2016’s “Moonlight,” he 
moves through each sequence 
with a swaggering gait, making 
the most of the film’s uninspired 
dialogue with an unprecedented 
balance of gravitas and charm. 
What’s frustrating, however, is the 
weak script, penned by Suzan Lori-
Parks (“Their Eyes Were Watching 
God”), inhibits Sanders from giving 
a fully nuanced 
performance, 
ultimately 
undermining 
his 
character’s 
motivations 
and 
masking his emotional interiority. 
The same goes for Layne, who 
delivers a striking performance 

despite her character having very 
little substance and arguably not 
enough screen time.
Much like Bigger’s aimlessness, 
“Native Son” meanders in its 
storytelling, setting up a potentially 
thrilling story only to disappoint. In 
the melodramatic final act, “Flight,” 
Bigger muses via voiceover: “The 
only thing worse than being blind 
is seeing but having no vision.” 
Ironically, “Native Son” seems 
to have a vision, one that’s both 
specific and fitting to the current 
socio-political landscape, but can’t 
see its own faultiness. 

‘Share’:

In the wake of the #TimesUp 
and #MeToo era, victims of sexual 
assault and harassment are finally 
getting the justice they deserve. 
Yet they are frequently left out of 
the conversation, with the media 
spotlighting its attention more 
on the perpetrator of the crime. 
When those affected are given 
the time to speak out, they have 
the unfortunate duty of reliving 
their trauma over and over and 
over again, as evidenced by Dr. 
Christine 
Blasey 
Ford’s 
long, 
comprehensive testimony during 
Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court 
Justice hearing.
No matter how hard we try to 
bury it, trauma is truly inescapable, 
a constant reminder of our inability 
to control the terrible, inexplicable 
things that happen to us. In the Age 

of Internet, it’s even more amplified 
and publicized than before, a 
trend that “Share,” a sensitive, 
haunting, feature-length follow-up 
to writer-director Pippa Bianco’s 
2015 short film of the same name, 
tackles with a humanistic deftness. 
In 87 lean, economical minutes, 
“Share” follows 16-year-old Mandy 
(newcomer 
Rhianne 
Barretto) 
in her quest to fill in the gaps of a 
humiliating experience captured 
on video that surfaced online. The 
experience in question remains 
ambiguous for both Mandy and 
the audience. It’s unclear whether 
an actual assault took place or not, 
but with the sparse details we’re 
given — a bruise on Mandy’s back 
and upper arm, a group of boys 
laughing at her unconscious body 
in the video — we get the sense 
that something nefarious definitely 
occurred. 
Rather than exploit Mandy’s 
assault like Netflix’s “13 Reasons 
Why” did with its protagonist 
through 
pulpy, 
high-school 
melodrama, 
“Share” 
does 
something different. It concentrates 
less on the people surrounding 
Mandy 
— 
her 
basketball 
teammates, her parents, the alleged 
perpetrator of her assault, the 
investigators looking into the crime 
— and more on Mandy’s reaction to 
her circumstances.

From the Sundance Film Festival: Days one and two

A heavy, jam-packed third day 
here at Sundance. I (almost) got the 
bus system down, met some more 
cinephiles and Michigan alums and 
learned how to structure my eating 
schedule: Find the cheapest places 
possible (coffee shops, Subway, Five 
Guys) and chomp on the go.
From Sunday afternoon to night, 
I watched three queer-themed 
films: two coming-of-age stories — 
the enjoyable but inessential “Adam” 
and the dull “To the Stars” — and 
a documentary, “Where’s My Roy 
Cohn?” Though the documentary 
was the best of the trio, “Adam” 
had the most engaged, enthusiastic 
audience. After the credits rolled, 
the crowd was treated to a quick 
Q&A session with the director and 
some of the cast from “Adam.”
(A quick note on walkouts before 
we get to the films: People ideally 
go to Sundance to support the 
artists and their work. But when 
someone walks out of the theater — 
sometimes at the beginning of the 
film, most times in the middle and 
confusingly right before the very 
end — it’s disheartening, entitled 
and antithetical to the spirit of the 
festival. The only valid exception for 
a walkout, in any given situation, is 
if a film is too graphic or triggering. 
But the walkouts I’ve observed so 
far, mostly in the press screenings, 

seem to be based more on the film’s 
quality and pacing than its content. 
Witnessing 
multiple 
walkouts 
during “Give Me Liberty,” “Where’s 
My Roy Cohn?” and “To the Stars” 
was distracting and aggravating, to 
say the least.)

‘Adam’:

“Adam,” the directorial debut 
of “Transparent” producer Rhys 
Ernst, is the kind of movie that 
will polarize audiences before it 
even comes out in theaters. Its 
risqué premise involves the titular 
character 
(Nicholas 
Alexander, 
“Good Girls”), a cisgender straight 
male, posing as a trans man in order 
to attract an older queer woman.
The 
controversy 
behind 
performing a marginalized identity 
is a well-known hot-button topic 
in Hollywood, with the intense 
backlash against Jared Leto and 
Scarlett Johansson’s attempts at 
playing trans characters being 
a pretty clear indicator that the 
LGBTQ+ community is adamant 
about proper representation in film. 
But even with its provocative plot, 
“Adam” doesn’t let its protagonist 
get away that easy, often forcing 
him to reconcile the inherently 
problematic nature of lying about 
his gender identity.
Additionally, the film, adapted by 
Ariel Schrag from her 2014 novel, 
makes plenty of room for actual 

queer and trans actors to play three-
dimensional 
characters 
whose 
gender and sexual orientations 
aren’t the only things that define 
them. Funny and even touching in 
parts, “Adam” flips the coming-out 
narrative on its head, playing with 
our preconceived notions about 
gender and sexuality through the 
lens of a naive teenager. It may not 
be the most groundbreaking nor 
inspired queer film, but it’s a start.
The film opens on a house party 
during the weirdly nostalgic year 
of 2006, where Adam, a bumbling, 
gangly high schooler, hesitates to 
make a move on a girl. Frustrated 
with his inability to get out of his 
comfort zone and the confines of 
suburban life, Adam decides to 
spend the summer with his gung-
ho older sister Casey (Margaret 
Qualley, in her second film at 
Sundance following “Native Son”), 
who has thrust herself in the New 
York City lesbian and trans scene. 
It’s at the Manhattan Pride Parade 
that Adam sees the free-spirited 
Gillian (India Menuez, “Nocturnal 
Animals”) and later meets at a post-
Pride function, only to lie to her 
about his age and his gender in order 
to impress her.
Once 
the 
initial 
discomfort 
of Adam pretending to be trans 
subsides, “Adam” unveils itself to 
be a fun albeit slight cringe comedy 
with hints of social commentary 
regarding the obliviousness of the 

straight world interacting with 
the queer world. In order to fit the 
part of a trans person and maintain 
Gillian’s attraction, Adam studies 
and memorizes every possible 
facet of the trans experience, from 
watching hormone tutorial videos 
to lying about which doctor did his 
top surgery.
Seeing Adam struggle to adjust 
to this charade is both the film’s 
greatest and weakest asset. It propels 
the action forward, but it’s only a 
matter of time before he’s found 
out. During one squirm-inducing 
sequence, for example, Adam finds 
himself at a women-only BDSM 
party with Gillian and hides his 
face with a leather fetish hood when 
he spots Casey at the venue. It’s a 
silly, delightfully absurd moment, 
but also representative of the film’s 
message. Through his exposure to 
a marginalized community, Adam 
begins to understand what’s it like to 
wear a mask, to hide parts of himself 
in order to conform with the rest of 
society.
Again, the concept of educating 
a straight cis male about what it’s 
like to be trans may not resonate 
so strongly with those who feel 
that actual queer people should be 
relegated to the center of the story as 
opposed to the background. There 
are certain moments in the first 
act that will definitely test people’s 
tolerance of the subject matter, such 
as when Adam makes out with an 
intoxicated 30-year-old woman in 
the bathroom of a gay nightclub and, 
mistaking Adam for a trans man, she 
fetishizes him, saying that she loves 
“tr*nny cock.” 
Notwithstanding these cringe-
worthy scenes, Ernst, a trans 
filmmaker himself, does a solid job of 
crafting queer and trans characters 
who exist beyond Adam’s world. 
Qualley, a master Movie Crier, 
delivers a searing performance 
as Adam’s sister, oscillating from 
supportive to combative with near 
seamless grace. In his acting debut, 
University alum Leo Sheng ‘17 
shines as Casey’s roommate Ethan, 
who embraces Adam as an unlikely 
friend and holds him accountable 
when he’s in the wrong. “Pose”’s 
breakout star MJ Rodriguez makes 
the most out of her all-too-brief 
cameo during the film’s climax.

If anything, the major flaws 
of “Adam” lie more within its 
mediocre script. While there are 
some genuinely clever quips and 
meaningful 
lines 
of 
dialogue, 
Schrag’s screenplay struggles to 
stir up enough compelling insight 
into Adam’s journey from clueless 
to conscientious ally. The constant 
references to 2006 pop culture 
— flip phones, popped collars, M. 
Night Shyamalan’s “Lady in the 
Water” — somehow feel more 
fleshed out than the main storyline, 
which seems to favor awkward 
humor and misunderstanding over a 
well-developed dissection of Adam’s 
incompetence.
Even with these faults, “Adam” 
compensates 
for 
its 
perfectly 
adequate 
execution 
with 
a 
consistent 
amount 
of 
charm. 
If viewers are willing to accept 
its 
controversial 
plot 
without 
dismissing it at face value, it might 
further the conversation on what 
LGBTQ+ inclusion could look like in 
the film industry. Just don’t go into it 
expecting to be the most exceptional 
queer film of the year. Instead, 
take it for what it is: an enjoyable, 
competent 
and 
entertaining 
coming-of-age story.

‘Where’s 
My 
Roy 
Cohn?’:

In Tony Kushner’s acclaimed 
play “Angels in America,” Roy Cohn 
is portrayed as a cruel and closeted 
lawyer dying of AIDS, haunted by 
the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg. While 
his role is technically fictionalized, 
it’s not too far off from the actual 
Cohn, who, according to Mark 
Tyrnauer 
(“Studio 
54”)’s 
new 
documentary “Where’s My Roy 
Cohn?,” spent the majority of his 
lengthy career lying not only to the 
public, but to himself.
A revealing, fascinating portrait 
of one of America’s most notorious 
political fixers, “Where’s My Roy 
Cohn?” highlights the trajectory of 
Cohn’s rise and eventual fall from 
fame, starting with his crucial 
role in the trial of Julius and 
Ethel Rosenberg in the 1950s and 
ending with his HIV diagnosis in 
the late 1980s. Through striking 
archival 
footage 
and 
in-depth 
interviews with Cohn’s closest 

associates (including one with 
the 
recently 
indicted 
Roger 
Stone), the documentary pulls no 
punches in critiquing Cohn for his 
ruthlessness, corruption, hypocrisy 
and manipulative influence over 
the political landscape during the 
second half of the 20th century.
Those 
unfamiliar 
with 
Cohn’s story will appreciate the 
comprehensive social and historical 
background used to contextualize 
his ascent to power. Those familiar 
with his story might dismiss it as 
just a visual extraction of Cohn’s 
Wikipedia 
page. 
Either 
way, 
“Where’s My Roy Cohn?” holds 
its 
titular 
subject 
accountable 
for his immoral crimes against 
American law, as well as for enabling 
controversial figures — specifically 
Joseph McCarthy, Ronald Reagan 
and Donald Trump — to assume 
leadership in the United States.
Like the best kinds of villains, 
Cohn’s upbringing was integral to 
his cynical attitude and abrasive 
personality. Cohn’s mother Dora 
treated him like a prince, which 
one of the interviewees of the 
documentary believed to be how 
he inherited a lack of ethics. The 
financial failure of his uncle Bernie 
Marcus’s bank during the Great 
Depression also motivated Cohn 
to succeed in order to rectify the 
shame his uncle brought onto their 
family.
After establishing himself as a 
hotshot lawyer in the early ’50s with 
the execution of the Rosenbergs, 
Cohn received the respect of 
Joseph McCarthy, later becoming 
his 
second-hand 
man 
during 
the 
infamous 
Army-McCarthy 
hearings. A thread the documentary 
weaves into this part of Cohn’s life 
— and later on after the downfall 
of McCarthyism — is the irony 
of his words juxtaposed against 
his actions. Whenever someone 
asked an implicit question about 
his closeted gayness during the 
Lavender Scare, for example, Cohn 
would consistently deflect, spinning 
the question back onto whoever 
was confronting him with vicious 
eloquence.

in seventh grade when I 
discovered the wonders 
of Pandora Music, a free 
radio 
service 
online 
that has since devolved 
in light of giants like 
Spotify. Despite this, the 
website will always hold 
a special place in my heart 
for gifting me a love of 
indie rock and dozens of 
artists that I still listen 
to today. Pandora was 
my constant companion: 
In the obnoxious red 
headphones I carried with 
me everywhere, on the 
shotty Mac desktop that 
sat on my dresser at home, 
blasting 
Grizzly 
Bear 
until the dogs came home. 
It’s where I discovered 
The 
Strokes, 
Feist, 
Interpol, everything that 
has shaped the seemingly 
eternal angst that fuels 
my love for rock. But most 
of all, what I found with 
Pandora’s help was music 
that I could really call 
mine for the first time.
I grew up in a musical 
household, 
my 
dad’s 
baritone echoing through 
the house as he practiced 
his own songs, my mom’s 
soprano yelling lyrics to 
Duran Duran and Roxy 
Music. My sister and I 
watched Shania Twain’s 
“Up” 
tour 
DVD 
an 
estimated million times 
between the ages of five 
and 10. It’s the reason 
I have such a love for 
folk music, for ’80s pop-
rock, for classic bands 
like The Beatles and 
soul artists like Donny 
Hathaway. I am eternally 

grateful to my parents for 
giving me such a crack 
education on what makes 
a good song good and a bad 
song bad. But as much as I 
love that music, as much 
as it has colored my life 
with joy and connection, 
it was never truly my 
own. I never felt the same 
sense of delight that came 
with the discovery of 
contemporary artists I 
loved, ones that I knew 
would keep making music 
for me to enjoy for years 
to come. My first concert 
without adult supervision 
was 
Arcade 
Fire’s 
“Reflektor” tour for my 
15th birthday, a fact that 
I will always be proud of. 
It was my choice, after all, 
even though my mother 
claims that she knew 
their music before they 
broke out of Canada.
And in this feeling of 
ownership over my own 
music taste, the happiest 
surprise I could have 
found was the world of 
women who rock. A few 
months ago, I was given 
Evelyn 
McDonnell’s 
anthology of women in 
music 
titled 
“Women 
Who Rock” by a mentor, 
and it immediately threw 
me back to that moment 

in middle school when 
I realized how big the 
world was for a girl who 
loved music. We tend to 
think of rock, especially 
classic rock, as a huge 
boys club full of illicit 
sex, drugs and thrashing 
drummers. I was afraid 
to go to a punk show until 
just last summer for this 
very reason. But through 
music 
journalism 
and 
books like “Women Who 
Rock,” it’s plain to see 
that this just isn’t the 
truth. Sure, women have 
a harder time breaking 
into the business and 
definitely did in the past 
more so than today, but 
they are there. They’re in 
the crowds at every show 
I go to, in the bathrooms 
of dingy clubs reapplying 
lipstick 
and 
shooting 
smiles to other girls. I 
have made some great 
friends avoiding mosh pits 
at concerts, as we huddle 
on the sides together as 
hyped-up teenage boys 
ram into each other in the 
center of the pit.
It’s 
the 
sense 
of 
togetherness that really 
catapulted 
me 
into 
wanting to write about 
music in the first place, 
as I explored the world 
of rock and slowly began 
to notice just how many 
incredible women painted 
the genre’s history and 
future. There are so many 
women who will forever 
be credited with creating 
rock as it is: Patti Smith, 
Siouxsie Sioux, Joan Jett 
and hundreds more.

To women who rock House of Vans quite impressive

Vans: the quintessential skater shoe, 
and a co-opted staple of “alt” kids for 
the last few decades. When one thinks 
of Vans they’re likely to think of the 
angry kid in high school who listened 
to too much A Day to Remember and 
Man Overboard. OK, fair enough, I’m 
just describing my own past, but to the 
company’s credit, they know how to 
put on a damn good pop-up concert/
art installation/skate park hybrid that 
offered Detroiters something a little 
new from the stream of performances 
at the city’s prototypical clubs.
This past weekend (Jan. 24 through 
27) Vans put together a wide variety 
of artists to perform at The Jefferson 
School in Midtown Detroit, which 
featured not only a stage for the 
artists but also classrooms filled with 
art installations and an entire skate 
park set up in the gymnasium on the 
third floor. Have I mentioned that the 
entire experience was free if you took 
the time to snag an RSVP online?
The first night began with sets from 
Detroit’s own Protomartyr and master 
of funk R&B Thundercat, which my 
coworker Jack Brandon covers below.
Friday night featured a private 
after party at Third Man Records for 
VIP ticket holders with DJ sets from 
the University of Michigan’s very 
own Matthew Dear and his label-
mate Shigeto (also from Ann Arbor). 
Attendees didn’t really start to stream 
in until 11:30 p.m., but the artists kept 
a steady stream of their widely praised 
house music during our entire stay. 
Yet, it seemed to function as more of 
a social function for the VIPs, whose 
interest in the beats was transient at 
best. 
Nonetheless, 
the music was killer, 
the bar was open 
and the Third Man 
Records 
storefront 
has always been one 
of the best and most 
unique spots to catch 
live music in Detroit.
Saturday 
brought 
the all-star combo 
of Detroit’s Danny 
Brown 
and 
LA’s 
Joyce Manor. In what 
can either be a stroke 
of luck or genius by 
Vans, the two artists 
were a match made 
in heaven for the alt/
punk crowd — Joyce 
Manor being one of 
the scene’s biggest 

pop-punk bands today and Danny 
Brown’s upbeat, biting hip hop being 
some of the most widely beloved 
among this crowd.
Joyce Manor, whose tracks average 
approximately a minute and a half in 
length, was able to rip through over 
20 songs during their 45-minute set, 
keeping small talk to a minimum and 
the snare drum on blast. As a band that 
started with loveable, albeit messy 
melodies, their growth has begun to 
leak into their back catalogue, opening 
with fan favorite “Heart Tattoo” 
and then deep cut “Derailed,” both 
of which have truly never sounded 
better. They only tossed in a couple 
of newer tracks from 2018’s Million 
Dollars to Kill Me, balancing their set 
with aggressive older tracks among 
the more pop-inflected new ones. 
Since their inception, Joyce Manor 
has been an unstoppable force in pop 
punk, and Saturday’s performance 
absolutely cemented them as some of 
the genre’s greatest.
After my few days at the pop-up, 
I can only hope Vans returns next 
year (hopefully in warmer weather 
as well), taking advantage of all the 
ways Detroit has begun to thrive as 
a cultural center for art and music. 
Transforming 
a 
Midtown 
school 
into a small artsy haven proved to be 
an incredible experience, bringing 
together artists of multiple genres 
and mediums without pretentiousness 
or inaccessibility. With so much to do 
in Detroit now, House of Vans offered 
a small glimpse at everything this city 
has to offer.

In the gym of The Jefferson 
School, Protomartyr’s maturity and 
aggression juxtaposed with a space of 
youth and insecurity recontextualized 
the sound of Protomartyr’s music. 

When I saw them back at The Blind 
Pig a few months ago, I had thought 
them noisy, past prime, but in a 
high school gym, I understood them 
better. So many teenagers want to 
converge with the assertiveness that 
Protomartyr exhibits. The group was 
relentless, enduring. Lead singer Joe 
Casey stands on stage like he’s pissed 
off at you, barking and singing, and 
I could only share that confident, 
this-is-how-I-feel-so-you-will-too 
energy he radiated. Putting this 
post-punk outfit on the stage of the 
gym, performing without any fright 
or indecisiveness turned me into a 
believer. There’s virtue in being strong 
willed. Protomartyr ended their set 
by reminding the audience to be kind 
to those left out in the cold, which 
resonates with truth in this current 
weather. Despite the nostalgia of the 
high school, Protomartyr didn’t let 
the audience indulge too much.
The sobriety of Protomartyr was 
dispelled, 
however, 
the 
moment 
Thundercat 
and 
company 
took 
the stage. He sauntered on stage, 
effortless, bathed in colorful light and 
behind a set sunglasses. They started 
to jam, and the intensity of the first 
set melted away, and the atmosphere 
of the gym felt permeable; so much so, 
actually, that a few members of the 
audience felt it acceptable to heckle 
the House of Vans sound engineers 
during the set. Thundercat paid it 
no mind. The compassion that comes 
with jamming and solos won out, 
in the end, and by the time closers 
“Friend Zone” and “Them Changes” 
played, I felt like I had experienced 
the ends of an extreme: Protomartyr’s 
shouts of self and Thundercat’s easy 
connectedness.

CONCERT REVIEW

DOMINIC POLSINELLI
Daily Arts Writer

Sally Wen Mao’s second poetry collection, 
“Oculus,” looks like an Instagram post. 
The cover of Mao’s new book features a 
mysterious woman hiding behind a Nikon 
and a conveniently in-the-way bunch of lilies, 
a DSLR mirror selfie covered by one of those 
white, centered, all-caps sans-serif titles that 
apparently aren’t out yet.
At first glance, it’s a too-cool-for-chroma 
feat of millennial eye candy. If you find enough 
interest to linger on the image, however, it 
grows ominous. The lens of the camera is nearly 
indistinguishable from its body, swallowing 
up the face of its owner and creating a gaping 
black hole in the focal point of the piece. The 
photographer is distanced from us by the black 
hole of the Nikon, the flowers, the title and the 
supposed mirror, which we can’t even see. The 
disproportional, gaping expanse of gray-blue 
above her head practically yawns “absence.” 
There’s a woman in this image, but it’s hardly a 
portrait.
The poetry in “Oculus” operates like the 
collection’s smart cover design. Mao’s poems 
are front-loaded with detail, flashing handfuls 
of hot topics, aesthetic trends and buzzwords 
that capture the attention of a particular 
audience (millennials and their apologists) just 
enough to create some interpretive distance 
between the reader and the more sinister forces 
at work underneath their poetic Instagram 
filter. In “Mall of the Electronic Superhighway,” 
the “makeup made of mica” and holographic 
guest-star appearances by James Baldwin, 
Whitney and Prince act as a sort of techno-
sensational gloss for what’s actually unfolding 
throughout the poem: The electronic mall is 
“curat[ing] an apocalypse / into a beautiful, 
fashionable memory the texture of the silk 
/ you can’t afford.” In another poem, the 
whitewashing of Asian roles in cinema is 
encoded in a “cyberpunk heaven” where an 
“investigator cyborg” reports a crime: 
 
“someone has implanted Scarlett Johansson’s
face onto mine; hacked my ghost, installed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an imposter’s memories, reprogrammed
my optic nerves, diluted my brain into a white
projection…” 

Mao is lifting contemporary tech-jargon 
keywords out of their comfortable Silicon 
Valley context and manipulating their excitable 
aura to illustrate high-gravity social concerns 
for an audience susceptible to the technical. 
The difficult distance between language and 
theme is intentional. Its unsettling affect, Mao 
seems to say, is the consequence of prioritizing, 
entertaining and investing in such flashy 
gadgetry — the consequence of spectacle.
Spectacle, it seems, is the unifying theme 
throughout “Oculus,” and one that Mao 
traces back from the Instagrammable cover 
and glittering technical jargon to cinema; 
specifically, early 20th century Hollywood and 
Anna May Wong, the first Chinese-American 
movie star. Wong appears throughout “Oculus,” 
travelling through time and space to reckon 

with her career. Particularly, her work in the 
’20s and ’30s is cast again and again as “the 
strumpet, the starved one” in “nacre and 
chignon,” always fated for “deception, despair, 
death,” roles objectifying and typecasting the 
Asian woman as a sexy cinematic disposable in 
the American imagination.
In “Oculus,” Wong is free. In a Vonnegutian 
feat of imagination, Anna May Wong is unstuck 
in time: She “fl(ies) the hell out in (her) Chrono-
jet,” makes out with Bruce Lee at a space bar 
and talks shit with Josephine Baker in Paris, a 
place to where both movie stars fled to escape 
Hollywood racism.
Almost a third of Mao’s collection is devoted 
to freeing the memory of Anna May Wong. Her 
liberation, however, is necessarily bittersweet. 
While travelling through time, throwing back 
space shots and attending Fashion Week, Wong 
meditates on the portrayal of East Asians in 
the American spectacle of her wake, from 
Long Duk Dong in “Sixteen Candles” to Gwen 
Stefani’s Harajuku Girls.
Through Wong, Mao traces the development 
of the spectacle and its nefarious encryption 

of stereotype from the the big screen to the 
little, merging effortlessly with the collection’s 
simultaneous preoccupation with gadgetry. 
The passive-oppressive power of spectacle is 
now in the hands and pockets of billions, across 
the globe, all the time. It’s exponential.
“Oculus” is brimming with information. 
Beyond her lyric biography of Anna May Wong, 
Mao conscientiously works modern-day media 
and current events into nearly all her poems, 
enough research to necessitate a section of 
explanatory notes at the end of the book, akin to 
an Oxford World Classic. Few volumes of poetry 
boast such backmatter — flipping back and forth 
between text and notes is a style of reading I 
figured highly academic and contained to, say, 
John Whittier-Ferguson’s Joyce class.
But this slim volume of contemporary poetry 
warrants it, too. Prior to discovering the notes 
(my first mistake was assuming they weren’t 
there), I went around telling too many people 
that Mao’s poems had the contemporary 
tendency to come off as handfuls of tasty 
language stylishly cast upon a page, free-verse 
style boo-rah. What I had initially written 
off as ornament, though, is actually far more 
calculated. Entire lines in “The Toll of the Sea” 
are lifted from 1922 silent film of the same 
name, the first Technicolor film ever made, and 
the self-titled “Oculus” is based on the story of 
a young woman in Shanghai who documented 
her suicide on Instagram in 2014. My favorite 
poem in the collection, “Lavender Town,” is 
named after the town in “Pokémon Red and 
Blue” where all the dead Pokémon are buried. I 
was deeply affected by it, even as someone who 
didn’t completely understand the reference 
having not played the games, which suddenly 
cast the poem in a more complex, melancholy 
light.
In this manner, the poems in Mao’s 
collection execute a deft two-punch maneuver. 
They first generate internal spectacle on the 
line, distracting from their local plot with flashy 
words and glittering gadgetry. Then, with this 
in mind, “Oculus” as a whole starts to look 
like spectacle, unveiling the artistic distance 
between the poetry and the very real, very 
serious topics and themes it comments on (the 
text and the notes, if you will). Mao’s poems 
don’t just comment on spectacle — they literally 
perform it, unveiling its subtle machinery and 
complicated network of repercussions right 
there, right on the page.

The 
polar 
vortex 
already 
canceled classes for Wednesday 
and 
Thursday. 
Now, 
it’s 
postponed tonight’s Michigan 
women’s basketball game against 
Iowa. The game will now be 
played on Friday at noon. 
The game is set to be an 
exciting one, with the nation’s 
leading 
scorer 
Megan Gustafson 
coming to town. 
The 
matchup 
between 
Gustafson 
and 
Wolverine center 
Hallie 
Thome 
was one that fans 
were 
excited 
to see, but that 
bout will now be 
rescheduled 
for 
Friday in the wake of Ann Arbor 
receiving some of the coldest 
weather it has ever seen. 
The bout represents a chance 
for the Wolverines (12-9 overall, 
3-6 Big Ten) to get back on track, 
coming in having lost four of 
their last five games. Michigan 
maintains a home record of 8-1, 
though, and in No. 13 Iowa, it had 
a chance to seize a signature win. 
That, for now, will be put on 
hold.
Michigan spokesperson Kurt 

Svodoba said Thursday morning 
that the postponement has made 
for a “crazy morning” so far, 
and stated that the teams have 
not yet set a date to potentially 
reschedule the game. A few 
hours later, the team announced 
the rescheduled time. Svodoba 
did, however, announce a deal 
that could excite some fans who 
will be unable to attend the game.
“Not only can (the ticket) be 

used 
for 
the 
rescheduled 
game, but it can 
also 
be 
used 
as 
a 
general 
admission ticket for any home 
game (this season),” he said.
Tickets for the original game 
can also be used Friday, though 
the game will no longer air on 
Big Ten Network. According to a 
press release sent by Iowa, details 
are still being hashed out on a live 
stream and radio coverage.

The Michigan women’s basketball team play Iowa on Friday at noon.

The underappreciated art of avoiding fouls

Over the last 15 months, 
as Michigan’s defensive star 
has ascended — taking the 
Wolverines from a team on 
the tournament bubble to the 
Final Four to a 20-1 record 
to start this season — nearly 
every reason why has been 
dissected and digested.
Assistant 
coach 
Luke 
Yaklich instilled a culture. 
Junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson and redshirt junior 
forward 
Charles 
Matthews 
enforced it. The virus took 
hold, then spread — and now, 
Michigan’s 
83.8 
adjusted 
defensive efficiency is on pace 
to be the best in the KenPom 
era.
But there is one element 
of 
this 
renaissance 
that, 
really, isn’t a renaissance at 
all. More accurately, call it a 
continuation.
The 
Wolverines 
don’t 
foul. They rank second in 
the country in defensive free 
throw rate, and since 2012, 
they’ve been worse than 25th 
just twice. That’s no recent 
development, but something 
preached within the program 
for quite a while.
“That’s stuff we’d work on 
all the time, is not reaching, 
not using an armbar,” said 
Spike Albrecht, a Michigan 
guard from 2013-17. “Things 
like that.”
In practices, the Wolverines 
can use slide drills or verbal 
reinforcement 
to 
stress 
avoiding fouls. In a game 
though, playing good defense 
while doing so is a sort of art.
“Especially on the ball, just 
picking up stupid fouls — they 
call like an armbar, instead 
your hands are up and you’re 
sliding and using your chest,” 
Albrecht 
said. 
“Cause 
you 
wanna be physical but you 
don’t wanna foul.
“Essentially you’re fouling 
with your chest instead of your 

arms, because lots of times, 
if a ref sees an arm in there, 
they’re more inclined to call it 
versus, ‘Hey, his hands are up.’ 
But you’re still making contact 
with the dude. Sometimes 
you can kind of get away with 
fooling the refs a little bit.”
This iteration of Michigan 
doesn’t just defend physically 
without 
fouling. 
It 
has 
perfected the art, and you 
don’t need to look too far to 
see it.
This is how 
Simpson turns 
opposing point 
guards 
— 
or, 
in 
Tuesday’s 
case, 
Ohio 
State 
center 
Kaleb 
Wesson 
— into overly 
frustrated 
playthings. It’s 
how Matthews 
has turned himself into a 
potential 
NBA 
commodity 
despite 
shooting 
just 
32.3 
percent from 3-point range. It’s 
how junior center Jon Teske 
has gone from merely tall to a 
dominant rim protector.
Anyone 
who 
has 
asked 
Michigan coach John Beilein 

about Teske in the last year 
has been treated to a range of 
hand motions, demonstrating 
his want for Teske to use 
verticality in the paint. After a 
65-49 win over Ohio State on 
Tuesday, Beilein had nothing 
but praise.
“He was trying to slap at the 
ball when the guy was coming 
up,” Beilein said. “He’d run 
his arms through him and use 
verticality, all the time. Now 
he’s learned to 
do it — wait, 
wait, be more 
selective 
with 
shots you can 
block.”
Teske may be 
the most overt 
example. 
He’s 
far 
from 
the 
only one.
Avoiding 
bad fouls is a 
part of Michigan’s defensive 
culture, as much as anything 
else. One of the keys behind a 
great defense, it turns out, is 
overwhelmingly simple.
“I don’t wanna say, ‘Hey, 
we don’t foul.’ We try not to 
have bad fouls,” Beilein said 
Thursday. “And if you look at a 

game, there’s three or four bad 
fouls every single game, that if 
you can avoid those, that could 
be the difference between a 
one-and-one, a guy in foul 
trouble, right, or a double-
bonus. So we try to avoid that.
“It’s 
just 
every 
day 
in 
practice, we’re very physical 
with how we practice, but 
bad fouls are pointed out 
every minute. And sometimes, 
people want to start every 
practice, ‘How are we gonna 
practice? Hard. How are we 
gonna practice? Smart.’ And 
smart is, don’t put them to 
the foul line. We can’t defend 
the foul line. We can’t defend 
a foul shot. So the one way to 
avoid that to happen is, don’t 
put them there carelessly.”
In this sense, Beilein has 
been the perfect complement 
to Yaklich. Asked on Tuesday 
who’s behind the emphasis, 
sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole struggled to come up 
with an answer.
“Coach B hates fouls,” he 
said, “and coach Yak loves 
defense, so —”
Then Isaiah Livers stepped 
in to finish the sentence.
“It works perfectly.”

In need of more than a series split, Wolverines to face Golden Gophers

It’s 
crunch 
time 
for 
the 
Michigan hockey team.
Coming off another series split, 
it must begin to make up ground 
in the Big Ten standings. Save 
dropping both games to Michigan 
State before the holiday break, 
the Wolverines have split every 
conference series.
Nine 
games 
remain 
for 
Michigan in the regular season, 
all against conference opponents. 
Heading into this weekend’s series 
at Minnesota, the Wolverines are 
only one point ahead of the three-
way tie for last place in the Big 
Ten. Eight points separate them 
from first-place Ohio State. At 
26th in the Pairwise rankings, at 
least 10 spots separate them from 
a potential at-large bid.
If Michigan hopes to make an 
NCAA Tournament appearance, 
it will need to begin coming out of 
weekends with more than three 
points.
The Wolverines can start by 
sweeping the Gophers, who are in 
third place — three points ahead 
of Michigan — in the Big Ten 
standings. By picking up their 
first sweep, the Wolverines will 
leave the company of Penn State 
as the only Big Ten teams without 

one.
“We have (felt a sense of 
urgency) 
for 
a 
little 
bit 
now, 
I 
think,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel Pearson. “So 
that’s why coming 
off 
the 
(series 
split) — it was 
disappointing you 
know — at Ohio 
State when you 
have the lead in 
the third period. 
And then played pretty well but 
made some bad mistakes in New 
York — because you can’t get 
those points back. And as you look 
at the standings, everything’s so 
tight. One game and you go from 
third place to last place, seventh 
place. So, it’s a huge shift there 
so yeah, we understand that, and 
we have to make sure we dial it up 
even another notch here and the 
last nine games that we have.
“I wouldn’t call (the rest of the 
games) must-win but the points 
are very critical. I mean, you don’t 
want to be at the end of the year 
after the regular season and say, 
‘Well, if we would’ve won this 
game here then we would’ve been 
on home ice.’ You don’t want that, 
so that’s how we’re approaching 
this, it’s a process.”

But as far as the rankings go, 
Pearson sounds unconcerned.
“You do A, B, C, 
D and you’ll have 
a 
good 
chance 
instead of looking 
at the standings,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“We don’t talk 
too much to the 
players about the 
standings or that. 
It’s 
just 
trying 
to do everything 
we can for that 
next game and give them the 
information they need to go out 
and execute and have a great 
game.”
Barring a late-season run, 
Michigan will most likely need 
to win the Big Ten Tournament 
to make a postseason appearance. 
If the Wolverines can manage 
to stay in the top half of the 
table, they are assured home-ice 
advantage in the first round, best-
of-three series of the tournament 
— and with every series split that 
passes, it is looking like the sole 
route to the NCAA Tournament.
Prior to the team’s flight to 
Minnesota, Pearson was asked 
whether he feels comfortable 
relying 
on 
the 
conference 
tournament to earn a bid.
“At this point I think we might 

have to be,” Pearson said. “The 
way the Big Ten Tournament is 
set up — I don’t 
want to say it’s 
any easier than 
any other league, 
but you have a 
better chance. If 
you can get past 
the first round, 
then you’re just 
in a single game 
format. It doesn’t 
matter where you 
play or who you 
play, you have to try and find a 
way to beat them once to move on, 
and that’s what it is. … And I think 
it’s more of a toss-up who is going 
to win that game because there is 

so much balance in the Big Ten.
“First round is a little tougher 
because if you’re 
going to be on 
the 
road, 
you 
have to go in and 
win two out of 
the three games 
and that’s a little 
more 
difficult 
to 
do 
on 
the 
road. 
Winning 
one game, hey, 
anybody 
would 
take that chance.”
It’s a chance Pearson is willing 
to take. And it’s a chance he will 
have no choice but to take — 
unless the team strings together 
back-to-back wins.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

With the Michigan football 
team’s 2018 regular season in the 
books, The Daily looks back at 
the performance of each unit this 
year and peers ahead to the future 
in 2019. In this edition: wide 
receivers.
Amid a disappointing 8-5 
season in 2017 that was marred 
by inconsistent play from the 
quarterback 
position, 
Grant 
Perry led all Michigan wide 
receivers with 307 receiving 
yards. Improvement, of course, 
was the minimum expectation. 
But with the addition of junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
from Ole Miss, hopes for the 
Wolverines’ 
talented 
pass 
catchers lay much higher.
Instead, despite a scattering of 
impressive performances, those 
hopes were marred by a lack of 
consistency 
and 
opportunity. 
Sophomores Nico Collins and 
Donovan People-Jones paced the 
group with 632 and 612 yards, 
respectively — ranking 151st 
and 161st nationally — making 
it 
five 
consecutive 
seasons 
without a 1,000-yard receiver for 
Michigan.
Behind them, the Wolverines’ 
struggles at the position only 
worsened. 
Sophomore 
Tarik 
Black missed most of the season 
with a broken foot for the 
second consecutive year. In his 
stead, Perry placed third among 
Michigan’s receivers with 147 
yards — just ahead of freshman 
Ronnie 
Bell 
and 
sophomore 
Oliver Martin.
HIGH 
POINT: 
With 
the 
Wolverines 
embattled 
in 
a 
defensive 
struggle 
against 
Michigan 
State, 
Patterson 
dropped into the pocket, stared 
down his favorite target and let 
fly. Seconds later and 79 yards 
away, Peoples-Jones strolled into 
the end zone untouched.
It was the type of career-
defining moment Peoples-Jones 
envisioned when he committed 
to Michigan two years ago as 

the top wide receiver recruit 
in the country, catapulting the 
Wolverines to their seventh 
consecutive win and first on the 
road over a ranked opponent 
since 2006.
Michigan’s 
receivers 
as a whole, peaked — not 
coincidentally 
— 
when 
the 
team as a whole did, amid its 
midseason push for a College 
Football Playoff spot.
A week later, in a 42-7 win over 
Penn State, Peoples-Jones and 
Collins shone again. Collins — a 
four-star recruit in the same year 
as Peoples-Jones — highlighted 
the performance with a 47-yard 
grab, and Peoples-Jones again 
caught the key touchdown pass, 
dragging his feet along the side 
of the end zone to put Michigan 
up 14 midway through the 
second quarter.
Against Rutgers the following 
week, it was Collins who caught 
two 
touchdowns, 
including 
a trademark jump ball over 
cornerback Avery Young in the 
corner of the end zone. That 
ability to make contested catches 
quickly became Collins’ most 
reliable attribute, as he finished 
with six touchdowns on the 
season, including two against 
Ohio State.
“The biggest thing is the way 
(the receivers) catch the ball,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
after 
the 
Rutgers 
game. “All the 
pass 
receivers, 
still the amount 
of drops is really 
so low right now 
for 
the 
year. 
The way they’re 
catching the ball 
is 
really 
good. 
Also, the separation they’ve 
gotten in the passing game. The 
precision in how they run the 
routes has been really good. The 
third thing I would point out is 
their blocking.”
LOW POINT: Peoples-Jones 
and Collins stood along the 

Michigan 
sideline, 
watching 
from afar as the Wolverines’ 
offense struggled more than 
its bevy of talent should have 
allowed for.
This is not a description of any 
specific moment. Rather, it’s a 
repeated 
scene 
that 
became 
emblematic 
of 
Michigan’s 
ultimately 
disappointing 
season. For each 
highlight-reel 
catch 
from 
its 
top receiving duo 
came a slew of 
drives in which 
the targets went 
elsewhere, the offense stagnated 
and the Wolverines fell short of 
their lofty potential.
In 
that 
same 
win 
over 
Michigan State, Michigan’s top 
duo combined for just 16 yards in 
the nearly three quarters before 
Peoples-Jones’ 
touchdown, 

as Perry and tight ends Nick 
Eubanks 
and 
Sean 
McKeon 
finished 
second, 
third 
and 
fourth, respectively, in receiving 
yards.
In the Wolverines’ season-
defining loss to Ohio State, it 
took 16 pass attempts before 
Patterson completed a pass to 
Collins. By the time he grabbed 
a second reception, the Buckeyes 
led 41-19.
Meanwhile, Black — another 
highly-touted signing from the 
2017 recruiting class — managed 
just four catches for 35 yards 
after returning from injury. He 
was the class’ most productive 
receiver early in his freshman 
season, racking up 149 yards in 
his three games at Michigan 
before his first broken foot 
sidelined him for the rest of that 
season. Since then, he has only 
seen sporadic usage, despite 
being declared fully healthy in 
early November.
The trio’s success when on the 

field led to calls for more three-
receiver sets, but the Wolverines 
instead opted to rely on their 
tight ends and running game. 
When they were used together, 
the results often followed, such 
as in a 71-yard first-quarter drive 
in the Peach Bowl, during which 
the three combined for 61 yards 
and a touchdown.
Unfortunately for Michigan, 
that seldom happened. Instead, 
the receiving corps’ success was 
sporadic, 
capping 
Patterson’s 
ceiling in his first season with 
the Wolverines.
THE FUTURE: The future, 
as with the present, lies in the 
hands of Peoples-Jones, Collins, 
and to a lesser extent, Black.
Just two years ago, those 
three — along with Martin 
— comprised one of the most 
impressive receiver hauls in 
recent memory. But through two 
seasons, they have managed just 
1,857 combined yards.
On Jan. 10, though, the group’s 

outlook took a sharp turn for the 
better when Michigan hired 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis from Alabama, where he 
was the co-offensive coordinator 
and wide receivers coach. Gattis 
helped coach a potent Crimson 
Tide passing attack that averaged 
320.2 yards per game. Four of 
Alabama’s 
receivers 
finished 
with at least 693 yards — more 
than any Wolverine pass catcher 
— including Jerry Jeudy, who 
won the Biletnikoff Award for 
the nation’s best receiver with 
1,315 yards and 14 touchdowns.
A 
year 
ago, 
Michigan’s 
offensive expectations hovered 
near an all-time low. Now, with 
Gattis in tow, an NFL-caliber 
quarterback under center and a 
prized recruiting class entering 
its junior year, 2019 has all the 
ingredients to be the Wolverines’ 
best offense in years. Whether 
or not it gets there may rest on 
the shoulders of its talented 
receiving corps.

Behind Enemy Lines: The Daily sits down with Iowa forward Tyler Cook

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team (20-1 overall, 
9-1 Big Ten) will face its 
toughest test since losing to 
Wisconsin two weeks ago when 
it travels to Iowa City to play 
Iowa (16-5, 5-5).
The Hawkeyes have been 
one of the biggest surprises 
in the Big Ten this season, 
playing their way into NCAA 
Tournament 
contention 
after missing out in the past 
two 
years. 
They 
struggled 
to a program-worst 4-14 Big 
Ten record a year ago, but 
have 
already 
improved 
on 
that win total with five in 
conference play so far this 
year 
— 
including 
victories 
over Ohio State and Nebraska. 
The biggest improvement has 
come on the defensive end, 
where they currently have the 
nation’s 120th-ranked adjusted 
defensive efficiency — up from 
242nd a year ago.
Offensively, they were 19th 
last season before improving 
to 10th this year on the back 
of a team-leading 16.6 points 
per game from junior forward 
Tyler Cook. The Daily sat down 
with Cook at Big Ten Media 
Day in October.
The 
Michigan 
Daily: 
What’s been the leadership 
role of players who were on the 
team when Iowa last made the 
NCAA Tournament in 2016?
Tyler Cook: Coming in when 
I was a freshman, we had Peter 
Jok. And he was a great leader 
from the standpoint of, he led 
by example. When you looked 
at Pete, he was always the first 
guy in the gym and always the 
last guy to leave. So when you 
ask guys like myself or Jordan 
(Bohannon) or Nicholas (Baer) 
or Isaiah (Moss), that was 
kinda our first impression of 
what leadership looks like. So 
whether we choose to lead in 
that same way or if we choose to 
be more vocal, we always gotta 
realize that it starts with what 
we do first. Holding ourselves 
accountable as individuals and 
then we can begin to other 

accountable as well.
TMD: Do the current players 
still keep in contact with Jok?
Cook: Yeah, most definitely. 
I talk to Pete probably a couple 
times a week, at least. And he’s 
back on campus during the 
offseason as well. So we talk 
with Pete and see Pete all the 
time.
TMD: What kind of advice 
does he have for you guys going 
into the season?
Cook: Really just to keep 
working, and keep working 
hard. Because preseason stuff, 
it only holds so much weight. 
The real show starts when 
we get on the floor. So when 
November comes, we lace them 
up and we’re ready to go, that’s 
when it really counts. So he just 
always tells us to keep working 

stay in the lab, don’t listed to 
what other people have to say. 
And just do what we know what 
to do and we’ll be fine.
TMD: Have you looked at 
the preseason rankings? Do 
you use them as inspiration?
Cook: I haven’t looked at 
the team standings yet. But 
they probably have us at the 
bottom. We got a team full 
of guys that have really been 
overlooked and underrated for 
the majority of our career so 
far so it’s nothing new to us. It’s 
more fuel to the fire and I think 
we use it to our advantage.
TMD: What went into the 
decision-making 
process 
to 
enter your name in the NBA 
draft last summer?
Cook: Toward the end of the 
season, I pretty much knew 

what I was gonna do, in terms 
of putting my name in the 
draft. I had a lot of interest, got 
a chance to work out for a lot 
of good organizations and got 
some good information as well. 
Made a lot of new friendships, 
new relationships and stuff. 
The decision to come back was 
tough, but I made it and I’m 
happy I came back. Hopefully, 
I’ll be in a better position — 
whether that be next year or 
the next year — for myself.
TMD: What feedback did 
they give you?
Cook: Teams aren’t gonna 
tell you, ‘Okay, you did bad in 
today’s workout.’ It’s kinda 
really on the individual to 
realize your strengths based 
on what they say they saw 
from you over the season, 

what they say they saw they 
liked, how you performed in 
the workout, going to head-
to-head with whatever guys 
they bring in with you. So at 
the end of the day, they really 
leave the decision up to you 
wholeheartedly and let you 
make your own decision.
TMD: 
What 
was 
coach 
(Fran) McCaffrey’s advice to 
you through that process?
Cook: 
Coach 
was 
super 
supportive 
of 
myself 
and 
basically just let me know that 
whatever decision I ended up 
making, he was 100 percent 
behind me. He forwarded me 
all the information that he got, 
we talked a lot throughout the 
process. I’d go to him for advice 
and stuff like that. So coach is 
— I couldn’t ask for anything 

more from him throughout 
that process. He was great and 
I wouldn’t expect anything else 
from him.
TMD: Have you used that 
experience of going through 
that process to mentor some of 
the younger guys who might go 
through that in the future?
Cook: 
Most 
definitely. 
Whenever I get information 
that can help myself get better 
or help any of my teammates get 
better, I always try to forward 
that on to them. Because I want 
my guys to be successful as 
well, in whatever they choose 
to do. So whatever they ask 
me, as to how it was like, I 
give them my honest opinion, 
what I thought about it, what 
they’ll see in the future. And 
I’ll continue to do that as well.

Sophomore wide receiver Nico Collins led all Michigan receivers with 632 receiving yards, good enough to rank 151st in the nation, along with six touchdowns.

The amount of 
drops is really 
so low right now 
for the year.
