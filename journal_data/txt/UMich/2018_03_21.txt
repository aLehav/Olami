University 
of 
Michigan 

Greek life organizations will 
transition to a winter semester 
rush process, according to a 
University press release. 

The move comes a semester 

after the Interfraternity Council 
suspended all social activities 
for two months after reports 
of hazing and sexual assault. 
Allegations 
included 
hazing 

that placed fraternity recruits in 
near-death situations, drugging 
members 
in 
undisclosed 

fraternity 
chapters 
and 
a 

number of claims of sexual 

misconduct involving fraternity 
brothers. 
At 
a 
closed 
IFC 

meeting in November, members 
urged each other to vote for the 
ban so as to avoid sanctions from 
national bodies. 

Starting in the 2019-2020 

school 
year, 
students 
will 

need to have completed at 
least 12 academic credits at 
the University and be in good 
behavioral 
and 
academic 

standing to be permitted to 
rush. This policy is already in 
place at many other universities, 
including Indiana University.

Neither IFC nor Panhellenic 

representatives responded to 
requests for comment.

“We have studied the impact 

of recruitment practices on 
first-year 
students 
in

first semester on campus and 

Aiming 
to 
highlight 

marginalized

on 

campus and promote social 
acceptance, LINK: Connecting 
Cross-Cultural Gaps Through 
a Common Language, a talent 
showcase hosted by student 
organizations 
Redefine, 
the 

Vietnamese Student Association 
and Zeta Omega Eta at the 
University of Michigan, was 
held Tuesday evening. 

The showcase, which featured 

speakers, dance groups, spoken-
word, art, film and comedy, 
among other art forms, drew 
about 100 students, faculty and 
community members. Before 
the speakers took the stage, 
attendees were able to browse 
photography exhibits and visual 
art from over 40 different artists 
who 
aimed 
at 
representing 

diversity among humanity.

The event began with a 

dialogue between two students, 
featuring a video that voiced 
the necessity of stripping away 
labels. In comparing labels to 
the cars we drive, the video 
explained we should focus on 
what’s on the inside rather than 
what is initially seen by the 
outside observer.

“Who would you be if the 

world never gave you a label, 
never gave you a box to check?” 
the video narrator said. “Would 
you be white, Black, Asian, 
Mexican, 
Middle 
Eastern? 

No. We would be one. We’d be 
together, no longer living in 
the era of calling human beings 
Black people or white people. 
These labels that will forever 
blind us from seeing a person for 
who they are, but instead seeing 
them through the judgmental, 
prejudicial, artificial filters of 
who we think they are.”

Hawra Altaee, a University 

alum and clinical therapist, was 
the first speaker at the event and 
detailed her experiences fleeing 
from violence during the Persian 
Gulf War. Altaee was born in 
Iraq amid the war, and explained 

when she was an infant, her 
family fled to Saudi Arabia 
where they were promised a 
few weeks in a refugee camp. 
Instead, they were forced to 
remain for four years with 
limited living conditions in 
the desert. In 1995, her family 
was given the opportunity to 
be randomly selected to come 
to the United States and as she 
continued her academic career, 
her experiences led to a passion 
for social work.

Altaee encouraged attendees 

to recognize the choices given 
between allowing struggles to 

stop or halt future endeavors 
versus 
using 
them 
to 
our 

advantage. She highlighted the 
ambition she saw in the room 
and gave her best wishes to 
those present in pursuing future 
goals, however large or daunting 
they may initially seem.

“We have a choice as to 

whether we allow our struggles 
and our circumstances and 
our hurdles to motivate us 
or whether we allow them 
to be a chip on our shoulder 
and to hinder us,” Altaee said. 
“Everybody in this universe

Tuesday 
night 
to 

discuss issues of gender inclusion 
and the promotion of the use of 
green books. The penultimate 
meeting of the seventh assembly 
centered most of its discussion 
on the upcoming CSG election, 
which will determine the newly

The meeting began with the 

reintroduction and the passing 
of various resolutions. These 
included a resolution to promote 
green books, a resolution to fund 
the remaining amount of the CSG

to 
encourage

The meeting then moved into 

executive communications, in 
which CSG executives delivered

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 21, 2018

See FAIR, Page 3A


The Apse in the University 

of Michigan Museum of Art 
was packed Tuesday night as 
American author Lydia Davis 
gave the first of two talks as 
part of the Zell Visiting Writer 
series — both reading from her 
short stories and encouraging 
attendees to get involved in 
politics at the local level. 
Davis is known for her short 
stories and was awarded the 
Man 
Booker 
International 

Prize in 2013. She has also 
translated many prominent 
works 
including 
“Swann’s 

Way” by Marcel Proust and 
“Madame Bovary” by Gustave 
Flaubert.

Throughout her talk, Davis 

read a variety of her recent 
original stories, ranging from 

one sentence to a few pages in 
length.

“All the stories I’m going to 

read tonight are very recent 
which means I haven’t tried 
them out so you may have to 
bear with me,” she said. “They 
are also a bit longer than they 
normally are.”

The first story she read 

was about her interest in 
dreams. After the reading, she 
explained how this story idea 
came about for her.

“I’m interested in dreams 

as a possible literary form or 
material for writing a little 
story,” she said.

All of the stories related to 

aspects of Davis’s personal 
life. In another story, she 
recounted 
her 
own 
son’s 

discovery of how to pronounce 
the 
word 
“egg.” 
Davis 

explained that in many of her 
stories, “as happens with most 
stories in real life, nothing 

had happened.”

University alum Cameron 

Giniel, who is interested in 
writing short stories, attended 
the event.

“I was really impressed 

with the way she captured 
these trivial moments that 
might be trivial but also come 
to life and how you work your 
way through that,” Giniel said. 
“It was really awesome to see 

how they come to life.”

The shortest story Davis 

shared was titled, “Improving 
my German,” which consisted 
of a single sentence: “All 
my life I had been trying to 
improve my German. At last 
my German is better, but now 
I am an old woman.”

“My stories do tend to be 

quite short because I don’t 
feel that there needs to be a 
standard length that I need to 

live up to,” Davis said. “When 
you are young you tend to be 
more conservative … When 
you grow older you learn more 
and more.”

In her final reading, Davis 

shared an experience that 
happened to her on a train 
in 
Europe. 
After 
asking 

someone to keep an eye on 
her belongings, she ended up 
going to significant lengths to 
make sure that the people who 
were watching them had good 
intentions. 

“When I write something I 

sometimes recognize certain 
patterns 
or 
rhythms 
and 

in this one, it was (author) 
Stephen Dixon,” Davis said. 
“He is very good and prolific 
and (his stories) set off as a 
sort of monologue. Another 
one is (novelist) Ron Carlson 
who has some very funny 
stories. If you read the work of 
someone and are impressed by 
it and have that kind of mind 
that remembers and imitates 
they can show up.”

Young-Eun 
Yook, 
a 

graduate student in the Helen 
Zell Writers’ Program, found 
Davis’s stories very different 
from others that she has read.

“The way she used humor 

was really interesting,” she 
said.

Davis revealed through her 

readings that it is not always 
easy to write short stories, 
especially the endings.

“Endings are very difficult 

as I’m sure everyone knows 
and usually the answer is to 
wait — to try something and 
come back to it a week or two 
later again and again. But 
sometimes it takes a couple of 
years,” Davis said.

David ended her talk by 

telling the audience that she 
is running for an elected 
position in the small village 
she lives in.

“I highly encourage people 

to run for office somewhere,” 
she said.

The University of Michigan 

set the stage for two Hollywood 
personalities on Tuesday as 
students frantically traced the 
stars via social media. Steve 
Carell, famed movie actor and 
television star, was spotted 
on a campus tour with his 
daughter. “Star Trek” actor 
Zachary Quinto was also seen 
on campus purchasing a mid-
day coffee at Starbucks on 
State Street. 

The 
celebrity 
sightings 

stirred up social media activity 

with 
photos 
corroborating 

their 
campus 
appearance. 

Some tweets captured Carell 
walking 
into 
the 
Student 

Activities Building to meet the 
tour and standing outside in a 
black baseball cap, black coat 
and dark sunglasses.

According 
to 
WMTV 

Channel 
15 
in 
Madison, 

Wis., Carell visited in the 
University 
of 
Wisconsin-

Madison on Monday prior to 
his appearance in Ann Arbor. 
Carell is best known for his 
role in the TV show, “The 
Office” and movies including 
the “Despicable Me” series and 
“Crazy, Stupid, Love”.

LSA 
sophomore 
Rebecca 

Bernstein saw Carell and his 
family checking out of the 
Graduate 
Hotel 
on 
Huron 

Street. While excited about his 
presence on campus, she was 
concerned about his celebrity 
status as he roamed campus 
for personal reasons.

“It was pretty cool to see a 

celebrity on campus, especially 
one who is so beloved by our 
generation,” Bernstein said. 
“I did feel bad for him because 
I 
could 
not 
imagine 
him 

simply trying to enjoy family 
time while being stalked by 
thousands of students.”

LSA sophomore Ilana Char 

also saw Carell on Tuesday.

“I just hope his daughter 

had a good tour and good luck 
to her as she starts the college 
process,” Char said.

While social media stirred 

about the presence of Carell 
on 
campus, 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Claire 
Stemper 

snapped a discrete photo of 
another 
celebrity, 
Zachary 

Quinto. Quinto most notably 
played Spock in “Star Trek.”

“We made eye contact once, 

but I don’t think he wanted 
to be bothered so I didn’t say 
anything, just stared a bit,” 
Stemper said. “I was definitely 
starstruck.”

Clad in yellow shirts of solidarity 

and grasping multicolored balloons, 
a diverse regiment of students 
rallied around the Cube in Regents 
Plaza yesterday protesting changes 
to student services by the Univer-
sity’s Division of Student Affairs.

Disgruntled students marched to 

the Fleming Administration Build-
ing and packed the University Board 
of Regents’ monthly meeting to 
demonstrate against projected cuts 
in student services over the next 
year, among other concerns.

Students from a broad coalition 

of campus groups entreated senior 
administration officials to rethink 
changes to numerous offices and or-
ganizations. Groups rallied around 
such issues as the cuts to this year’s 
Pow Wow, anticipated changes to 
the Greek system, slashes to the 
Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Affairs budget and the 
lack of resources in the Office of 

Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.

Their concerns extended beyond 

student affairs issues. Protesters 
also criticized the administration 
of what they called apathy in the 
face of declining minority enroll-
ment and inaction concerning hate 
crimes. Alleged negligence of multi-
cultural affairs, LGBT issues, sexual 
assault services and hate crime 
protocols all represent an “elimina-
tion of safe spaces” on campus and 
highlight what dissenters say is the 
University’s hypocrisy on diversity.

En route to the administration 

building, more than 100 students 
chanted, “Give us a voice, let us 
make a choice.” They wore yellow 
shirts stating “Royster cut student 
services, and all I got was this lousy 
T-shirt” and carried posters implor-
ing the administration to “Take 
diversity seriously.”

After public comments had 

concluded, students shouted and 
stood in support of the speakers at 
the Regents meeting. Four regents 

responded to students about their 
concerns, despite the tradition of 
remaining silent during or after 
public comments. 

“I believe we’ve heard your 

pain,’ Regent Olivia Maynard 
(D-Goodrich) said to students and 
members of the board. “We want 
you to know that we are listening.”

But not every regent offered 

conciliations. Many students were 
offended by the remarks of Regent 
Andrew Richner (R-Grosse Pointe 
Park), who suggested the protesters 
transfer their energy to Monday’s 
basketball game against Oklahoma.

While most board members 

stressed building a stronger rela-
tionship between students and the 
administration, many noted the 
difficult budget situation. 

For the Greek system, the admin-

istration is considering mandating 
substance-free housing, professional 
live-in advisors and a delay of the 
rushing process.

ON THE DAILY: STUDENTS STARSTRUCK BY CELEBRITIES ON CAMPUS

MacArthur Fellow Lydia Davis talks 
inspiration for prize-winning stories

SOPHIA KATZ
Daily Staff Reporter

“I was really 

impressed with 

the way she 

captured these 

trivial events that 
might be trivial 
but also come 
to life and how 
you work your 
way through 

that. It was really 
awesome to see 
how they come to 

life.”


struggles equally but differently. 
We all have daily obstacles and 
challenges that we face whether 
it shows on our face or not, 
whether it’s apparent or hidden.”

Dean’s Fellow Sean Smith, a 

University alum, also took the 
stage to speak, highlighting 
the adjustments he had to 
make when he came to the 
University. He explained while 
the University presented the 
same kind of diversity as in New 
York City, groups seemed to be 
clustered racially with “invisible 
force fields,” between these 
different cultures.

“The first year I was here I 

didn’t really challenge that, and 
I went home that summer and 
I felt bad,” Smith said. “When 
I came back in the fall of 2015, 
I shopped around looking for a 
community, and I found pockets 
of 
like-minded 
people, 
but 

something was still missing.”

Smith 
presented 
“five 

practical points” to encourage 
breaking down barriers between 
groups, including being present 
and engaging with surroundings, 
challenging norms to enter new 
spaces, having the ability to 
discern feelings of discomfort 
and being intentional in making 
plans rather than suggestions. 
He also argued that the present 

is the most convenient time to 
make change, as “you don’t need 
a credential to treat someone 
decently.”

Other performances included 

those 
from 
dance 
groups 

Brazilian Zouk, Arabesque and 
Female Gayu, a presentation by 
Public Policy senior Ibrahim Ijaz 
on Arab calligraphy, as well as 
multiple vocal and spoken-word 
performances.

LSA sophomore Ceren Ege 

presented 
a 
spoken-word 

poem titled, “By Blood,” which 
illustrated experiences being 
raised in a Muslim community 
and spoke to her belief in the 
importance of challenging the 
assumption that people agree 
with every aspect of their 
cultural identity.

“As soon as my cherry red 

cheeks could speak my mother 
told me to repeat after her that 
I had been given the greatest 
gift of all and that that was 
family and that I would never 
love anyone more than my 
family,” Ege said. “I didn’t 
agree and I told her that 
expecting people to get along 
just because they’re in the 
same family is like expecting 
different types of fish to get 
along just because they’re in 
the same tank.”

LSA junior Mariam Reda, 

co-founder 
of 
Redefine, 

helped organize the event and 
highlighted 
her 
excitement 

promoting 
social 
acceptance 

through 
creative, 
student-led 

presentations and performances.

“The purpose of Redefine 

itself 
is 
to 
promote 
social 

acceptance through the creation 
and exhibition of original student 
talent,” Reda said. “(Looking 
around) I see so many different 
people of varying identities just 
coming to appreciate the same 
thing which I feel so happy 

about and I feel that we’re really 
making an impact and promoting 
the fact that dialogue doesn’t 
solely have to be through speech, 
it can be through creativity as 
well.”

their initiative and I think they 
should get credit for that.”

AAATA is in the process of 

waiting for funds for a two-year 
pilot program of the service. 
They applied through the federal 
congestion and air mitigation 
grants, requesting $579,500 for 
each year. Carpenter said they 
have no intention of using local 
funds, and if the federal funding 
doesn’t 
follow 
through, 
the 

service will likely not be offered.

“Because the riders from this 

service are not going to be from 
Ann Arbor, or residents from 
Ann Arbor primarily, it’s very 
important to us that our local 
taxpayers understand that we’re 
not using any of our locally-
generated funds to pay for this 
service,” Carpenter said. “This 
service is going to be funded by 
an outside grant, or some other 
outside source of funding, 

or it’s probably not going to 
happen.”

Carpenter 
predicted 
the 

major benefits of the service 
would be improving access to 
Ann Arbor even through heavy 
traffic congestion, which U.S. 23 
is known for. It would also allow 
access for people unable to drive 
in that area. The two major risks 
in creating the service, he said, 
are it being either too popular or 
not popular enough. Those risks 
are the reason the service would 
start out as a temporary program.

“One risk is that it works and 

one is that it doesn’t,” Carpenter 
said. “If it’s not very popular 
and not many people use it, we’d 
probably just have to bring it to a 
close. Another possibility is that 
it’s far more popular than we’ll 
be able to afford. We call that the 
‘victim of our own success’ risk.”

Another challenge AAATA 

faces is, as Carpenter noted, few 
similar services exist to predict 
rider estimates.

“One of the challenges we have, 

and one of the reasons we want to 
do this as a pilot project, is there 
are very few similar services out 
there in Michigan, so it’s hard 
for us to draw comparisons with 
another service,” Carpenter said. 
“It’s a very new creature, and 
for that reason the ridership is 
unknown.”

Many of the customers of 

this service could be University 
employees, like Briscoe. The 
University’s most recent data 
showing the numbers of faculty 
and staff living in or around 
Whitmore 
Lake 
found 
644 

living in Whitmore Lake, 850 in 
Pinckney, 719 in South Lyon and 
668 in Brighton.

The 
service 
could 
be 

advantageous for the University 

as well. Stephen Dolen, the 
University director of Logistics, 
Transportation 
and 
Parking, 

said he has a close working 
relationship with AAATA in 
terms of discussing initiatives. 
He said he is in support of this 
proposed service because the 
University aims to reduce the 
demand for parking spaces in 
any way it can. Presently, they do 
this through vanpool programs 
or trying to park people remotely 
and bus them to campus. Because 
some of the employees from the 
targeted area drive their car 
to work each day, if the service 
succeeded, they would not need 
to use parking as often.

“We would help to promote it 

as best we can,” Dolen said. “We 
do everything we can to try and 
discourage 
single 
occupancy 

vehicle trips to campus. We’d 
rather use land for academic, 
research or health care missions 
of the University than we would 
to build parking.”

The buses used would not 

be typical urban transit buses; 
they would be highway coaches 

similar to those used for AAATA’s 
AirRide 
service 
between 

Ann Arbor and the Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport. Further, 
they would allow passengers 
Wi-Fi access. Carpenter said they 
included Wi-Fi in the proposal to 
attract those who may be wary of 
riding buses.

“Part of it is an experiment 

to see if that attracts people out 
of their cars,” Carpenter said. 
“This is a new service and some 
people are going to be a little 
unfamiliar. So Wi-Fi gives you 
the opportunity to make better 
use of your time while you are 
commuting. One of the benefits 
travel by bus has is you don’t have 
to pay attention to the road.”

However, driving to work still 

has its conveniences. Briscoe said 
one of the drawbacks of using the 
service would be not having a car 
available for emergencies.

“I guess in the event of an 

emergency, 
having 
no 
car 

accessible throughout the day 
(would be difficult),” Briscoe 
said. “For example, my daughter 
called me to come home sick 
yesterday and I had to leave at 
like 11 a.m., so I don’t know if 
there is a proposed fix for issues 
such as that.”

Nevertheless, 
Carpenter 
is 

optimistic about the widespread 
positive effect the service might 
have.

“Let’s say there’s a nurse that 

might use this service to get to 
the hospital,” he said. “Does it 
benefit her? Yes. Does it benefit 
the hospital? Yes. Does it benefit 
the 
patient 
whose 
surgery 

can be scheduled that much 
faster because they don’t have 
a labor shortage of nurses? Yes. 
It benefits a great number of 
people.”

food distribution event being held 
this week in conjunction with 
the Food Access Task Force and 
Maize & Blue Cupboard. The issue 
of food insecurity is one that has 
been addressed throughout this 
year’s assembly, and is actively 
being combated by CSG, according 
to Sarkar.

“The importance of this event 

is that it supports the research 
that needs to be done about food 
insecurity on campus,” Sarkar 
said. “We want to de-stigmatize 
the event that’s happening.”

Additionally, 
numerous 

representatives in the assembly 
commented on the pervasiveness 
of the upcoming CSG election, in 
which students can begin voting 
on Wednesday. During the past 
months, issues arose regarding 
the election code and appropriate 
endorsement standards for the 
respective 
parties 
running, 

and they are continuing to be 
discussed while polls are open 
to students. LSA junior Seth 

Schostak informed the assembly 
of his efforts to determine what 
the students want to see in terms 
of changes made by CSG. Schostak 
told fellow representatives of 
the importance of listening to 
student concerns instead of simply 
counting them as a signature on 
a petition, which was met with 
applause and snaps from the 
assembly.

“Ask for input if you guys are 

campaigning,” 
Schostak 
said. 

“Don’t just try to get information 
out of people. Try to do something 
for them if they’re taking the time 
to talk to you.”

The 
assembly 
was 
then 

introduced to a new resolution, 
which will overhaul the operating 
procedures of the assembly. Due 
to the fact that a new assembly 
will be installed in the coming 
weeks, much of the conversation 
surrounding 
this 
resolution 

rested on the idea that a new 
assembly would be taking over 
responsibility for its passing.

determined that adjusting the 
timeline to winter semester 
supports 
first-year 
student 

success 
by 
providing 
the 

opportunity to fully engage in 
curriculum and communities,” 
Harper said.

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones and a team representing 
the Greek life community will 
monitor the transition.

“In partnership with our 

Greek Life community student 
leaders, we are committed to 
working together to develop 
an implementation plan that 
ensures 
this 
recruitment 

timeline 
adjustment 

strengthens 
our 
entire 

community,” Jones said.

IFC 
reinstated 
social 

activities this January, but also 
mandated the removal of hard 
alcohol from all events. Twenty-
seven chapters received specific 
action plans drafted by IFC 
executives and the Office of 
Greek Life. Since November, 
administrators from University 
President Mark Schlissel to E. 
Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, to the Board of 
Regents repeatedly emphasized 
the 
council’s 
self-regulated 

efforts.

“I want to applaud you for 

all the work that you’re doing 
along with other students to 
provide a safer environment in 
our fraternities and sororities,” 
Regent Denise Ilitch, D, told IFC 
president Sam Finn, a Public 
Policy junior, at a February 
board meeting. “I can’t tell you 
how many of the headlines that 

we read across the country 
where students are harmed and 
unfortunately, it’s tragic. Some 
students have died over hazing 
and drinking. It’s a real issue on 
campus.”

According to the press release, 

this change is part of a larger 
five-year plan in coordination 
with the University’s Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion efforts for 
first-year students. The Division 
of Student Life already hosts a 
wide range of workshops and 
community-building activities 
focused on improving academic 
and relationship success, but 
the new initiative will focus on 
increasing engagement in these 
programs.

Harper told the Record it’s 

the University’s responsibility 
to 
help 
incoming 
students 

transition into college.

Aside from delaying the Greek 

life rush process, the University 
plans on expanding Michigan 
Learning 
Communities 

throughout 
more 
schools 

and colleges and developing 
additional theme communities 
in residence halls. They will also 
increase the scope of the seven-
week goal-setting course titled 
Making the Most of Michigan, 
which is taught in the residence 
halls, and prioritize University 
Career Center programs that 
focus on first-year students. 
Additional programming is also 
planned, such as expanding 
the Intercultural Development

across the country, and the 
Cold War prompted the federal 
government to invest money 
into the education system, 
African-American 
students 

continued to be disadvantaged 
by the underlying structure 
that shut down school districts 
and allocated funds for white 
students to attend schools in 
richer, segregated areas. 

Anderson also went on to 

credit the War on Drugs as 
another response of white 
rage 
to 
the 
advancement 

of 
African-American 

citizens. The previous shift 
in mass funding to public 
schools was reallocated to 
correction facilities with a 
disproportionately 
higher 

number 
of 
Black 
men 

incarcerated compared to white 
men — destabilizing Black 
families and communities in 
the process. This was done 
even though many of the 
crimes were clearly fabricated.

As a former International 

Studies major and admirer of 
Anderson, 
University 
alum 

Brianna Allen said she came 
to the talk to follow up with 
current events through the 
lens of race. She expressed her 
dismay with the severity of 
the false accusations against 

members 
of 
the 
African-

American community. 

“You just see how much 

people want to bring down 
the 
African-American 

community,” Allen said.

Anderson linked the spike in 

the incarceration rate of black 
men with voter suppression 
of 
the 
African-American 

community. She explained 
factors like gerrymandering, 
underequipped polling places 
and bans on former felons 
from voting all contribute 
to 
lower 
African-American 

voter turnout, and in doing so, 
impede the full participation 
of the Black community in 
democracy and society.

Anderson ended her talk 

on a more optimistic note of 
hope, citing former President 
Barack Obama’s historic 2008 
campaign inspiring an extra 15 
million people to turn out and 
vote. 

She 
explained 
that 
the 

trend of voter suppression is 
slowly disintegrating because 
those who were previously 
suppressed 
persevered 
and 

showed up at the polling 
places. According to Anderson, 
the right way to move forward 
from 
voter 
suppression 
is 

to embrace the new people 
showing up at the polls.

“(If they show up they) have 

a stake in the government, 
value participating politically, 
and don’t feel alienated,” she 
said. 

University alum Catherine 

Lebar 
expressed 
how 

Anderson’s 
hopefulness 

resonated with her the most. 

“She still has a positive 

vision for the future and this 
is what I think we should be 
spreading,” Lebar said.

Anderson 
also 
explained 

another way to counteract the 
long-term disenfranchisement 
of African Americans is by 
dissecting 
the 
prevailing 

narrative that white people 
built the U.S.

“The narrative most folks 

have is that it’s a white nation 
and whites only built America,” 
she said. “As a nation of merit, 
so much of who we are is based 
on we worked hard for this, we 
earned this, so having this type 
of conversation is difficult … 
(It) feels like you’re attacking 
someone’s foundational sense 
of self and identity.”

“If it’s not very

it, we’d probably 
just have to bring 

it to a close.”

“(Looking 

around) I see so 
many different 
people of varying 

identities just 

coming to 

appreciate the

To the Arabs and Muslims on campus, keep the MomentUM going

REEMA KAAKARLI | OP-ED

I 

wasn’t able to put a name 
to 
my 
sexuality 
until 

my 
sophomore 
year 
of 

college. Before, I had always felt 
stuck between two labels that 
didn’t feel right. I was either 
heterosexual or a lesbian, and 
there could be no in between. I 
would develop a crush on a boy 
in one of my classes and think, 
“I’m cured! I’m normal! There’s 
no reason for me to worry!” Then 
I would find myself daydreaming 
about some female celebrity, and 
I would immediately question if 
all the feelings I had toward boys 
were actually fake, something I 
had forced upon myself in order 
to function in a heteronormative 
society. I remember once hearing 
a close friend’s mom say, “I can 
understand being gay, and I can 
understand being straight, but I 
don’t understand being bisexual. 
It’s so selfish — just pick a side!” It 
took meeting other bisexual folks 
for me to understand the way I 
experienced attraction wasn’t 
abnormal, it wasn’t me being a 
traitor to LGBTQ folks — it’s just 
who I am.

Janelle 
Monae 
recently 

released a single titled “Make Me 
Feel” and, along with it, a colorful, 
fun and undeniably bisexual 
music video. The first time I 
watched it, I felt myself rooting 
for Monae and Tessa Thompson 
to leave the bar, the setting of the 
video, together — thus confirming 
their relationship. I found the 
scene where Janelle Monae jumps 
between Tessa Thompson and a 
man — seemingly unable to decide 
between who she is most attracted 
to, finally choosing to dance with 
both of them — a bit awkward. 
But when I stopped thinking of 
the video as a story, and more 
as an allegorical representation 
of Monae’s sexuality, I began to 
really understand what I felt the 
artist was trying to convey. The 
scene where she jumps between 
Thompson and the man was a 
representation of her attempting 
to pick a gender, and when she 

finally gives up and just dances 
with the two of them, together, 
it’s a statement that she doesn’t 
have to pick one or the other. 
When the music video was over, 
I immediately sent it to one of 
my friends, someone who also 
identifies as bisexual, along with 
the message, “I feel so validated!”

Art, 
as 
a 
representation 

of life, is often used to help 
us understand ourselves and 
how we should structure our 
lives. Through film, music and 
other art forms, I had been 
convinced that a person could 
not be attracted to more than 
one gender — to be otherwise 
was an aberration. On film and 
TV, bisexuality was reserved 
for characters who were almost 
always 
female, 
generally 

unstable and promiscuous, and 
was often portrayed as a phase 
that would eventually end once 
the character found consistency. 
It was never presented as an 
actual, acceptable and long-term 
way of living out attraction.

Though 
bisexuality 
has 

existed in art for a while, in the 
past I have struggled to find my 
sexuality represented in ways 
more obvious than a subtle hint 
or a mispronounced pronoun. 
So, lately, I have been seeking 
out and appreciating art, created 
recently, 
that 
is 
explicitly 

bisexual. The character Ilana 
from “Broad City” is shown 
having 
relationships 
with 

people of all genders, and her 
long-term attraction to Lincoln 

isn’t seen as a statement of her 
heterosexuality, 
but 
instead 

just one relationship of which 
she happens to be a participant. 
Halsey, on her song “Bad At 
Love,” 
discusses 
her 
failed 

relationships with both men and 
women, and she also recorded 
a duet with Lauren Jauregui 
where they express their sexual 
interest in one another. And 
most recently, Monae’s “Make 
Me Feel” — sexy, vibrant and 
undeniably queer.

In the future, I hope to 

see more art that reflects the 
struggles and experiences of 
bisexuality in a way that is 
upfront and unabashed. I want 
to see more characters in TV and 
film who have relationships with 
people of more than one gender 
and are not asked to defend the 
decisions they make in their 
romantic lives. I want to hear 
more music that explores the 
nuances of being bisexual, and 
I want to see representations of 
people involved in long-term, 
monogamous 
relationships 

but 
who 
still 
identify 
as 

bisexual. Bisexual erasure is a 
real phenomenon, and unless 
there is a push to bring greater 
exposure to bisexuality, harmful 
narratives will continue to exist. 
I hope to see a day where young 
people don’t have to wait 19 years 
of their life to finally have the 
language to express themselves, 
and won’t ever feel the need to 
prove their sexuality.

When I experience art that 

is bisexual, I am reminded that 
though I live in a world that 
enjoys placing people into sharp 
and defined boxes, I can choose 
to exist in a place that is fluid and 
abstract. I can reject to make the 
decision that society is constantly 
asking me to, and as Cupcakke 
assures me in her song “LGBT,” 
“You ain’t gotta pick a side,” I can 
stay just where I am.

I

f you’re anything like me, 
you think Central Student 
Government 
election 

season at the University of 
Michigan is a nuisance at best. 
As a freshman, I had serious 
doubts about the ability of 
Central Student Government 
to 
accomplish 
anything 

meaningful or substantial, or 
if it could, then I had doubts as 
to whether Arab and Muslim 
voices would matter at all in 
that setting.

Just a few years ago, the 

Arab community on campus 
seemed fractured and invisible 
with no clear central authority 
to which we could address our 
concerns and aspirations, and 
no clear institutional support 
for improving student life in 
ways that narrowly affected 
our community. The Muslim 
community 
seemed 
only 

slightly better in these regards 
but was still relatively weak in 
its administrative ability to 
deal with rising incidences of 
Islamophobia. At that time, it 
was difficult to even imagine 
a place for inserting ourselves 
into important administrative 
conversations, as so few Arabs 
or Muslims were represented 
in CSG, and the ones that were 
present were known to have 
faced discriminatory remarks 
and subtle racism to get there.

Now, as a graduating senior, 

I have come to see the Arab 
and 
Muslim 
communities’ 

place on campus in a totally 
different light. These past two 
years especially, have seen 
important victories for us 
and it has become clear that 
administrations, 
including 

CSG, have begun to take our 
collective concerns seriously. 
In the past two years, CSG 
has uplifted the voices of 
historically 
marginalized 

Palestinian 
students, 

responded to ugly incidences 
of Islamophobia in reflection 
rooms, administered reforms 
and, crucially, has made the 
broader Arab community on 
campus more visible with the 
support for the implementation 
of a Middle Eastern/North 
African identity category on 
official University documents. 
This most recent resolution 

supported by CSG will help 
the 
ME/NA 
community 

going forward by providing 
pertinent 
demographic 

information on issues like 
retention 
and 
graduation 

rates, allocation of funding 
and bias incident reporting.

But these huge victories 

were not won alone. Our 
communities, 
both 
Arab 

and 
Muslim, 
have 
relied 

on 
our 
allies 
on 
campus 

to bring attention to our 
unique needs. And in this 
respect, Engineering junior 
A.J. Ashman and LSA junior 
Charlie 
Bingham 
must 
be 

thanked for their work and 
dedication. 
I 
didn’t 
know 

either of them then, but I saw 
and recognized their presence 
at the University Board of 
Regents meeting when the 
implementation of the ME/
NA box was being debated. 
I saw them proudly sporting 
#WeExist shirts, and they 
were present and supportive 
for the right reasons. Both 
Ashman and Bingham stood 
in solidarity, recognizing how 
minority 
experiences 
can 

often be detrimental to our 
collective feeling of belonging 
on campus. They were there 
for us even before either of 
them decided to run for office. 
Now, they have partnered 
to 
create 
the 
MomentUM 

campaign, highlighting issues 
like ours and similar issues for 
other minority communities, 
relying 
upon 
Arabs, 

Muslims and allies to build a 
comprehensive platform that 
speaks to our needs.

Representation 
matters, 

and 
this 
year’s 
slate 
of 

candidates 
with 
the 

MomentUM party are the 
most 
representative 
and 

diverse yet, including the 
most 
Arab 
and 
Muslim 

representatives to run with 
a party to date. It’s not 
enough that the candidates 
are demographically diverse. 
Indeed, these candidates are 
all 
incredibly 
passionate, 

competent 
and, 
most 

importantly, eager to continue 
making positive changes on 
our campus. What separates 
them from other candidates? 
The MomentUM team wants 
to center voices and concerns 
that affect communities on 
campus from both visible and 
invisible identities. In fact, 
The Daily’s CSG debate last 
Thursday 
highlighted 
how 

MomentUM alone addresses 
these 
issues. 
Every 
party 

mentioned 
the 
struggles 

of invisible identities, but 
only MomentUM candidates 
mentioned ME/NA students 
in particular. The ME/NA 
category was recorded for the 
first time in a CSG report, and 
it was Ashman who made that 
change to input that data in 
that report. In fact, Ashman 
specifically requested that 
CSG redo the survey just 
to make sure that data was 
available for analysis. Being 
included in the MomentUM 
campaign gives affirmation 
to their experiences while 
simultaneously 
uplifting 

them, 
especially 
for 

Arabs 
and 
Muslims 
who 

aren’t 
necessarily 
clearly 

identifiable as such but who 
nevertheless bear the brunt 
of 
anti-Arab 
racism 
and 

Islamophobia.

Now is our opportunity to 

elevate our communities by 
bringing them into the fold 
of 
University 
governance. 

CSG 
does 
affect 
student 

experiences whether we are 
aware or not, so it’s important 
that 
we 
understand 
the 

consequences of our votes. It’s 
time for Arabs and Muslims to 
keep the MomentUM going.

D

emocrat Conor Lamb 
defeated 
Republican 

Rick Saccone in last 

week’s special election for the U.S. 
House seat in Pennsylvania’s 18th 
Congressional District, extending 
the Democratic Party’s winning 
streak and possibly offering a 
glimpse into the future electoral 
landscape a little more than seven 
months before the 2018 midterms.

Though the official results of 

the election are pending a final 
count, Lamb’s victory shook the 
political world and suggested 
that Republicans will have to 
withstand a massive Democratic 
wave this November if they are to 
retain their majorities in Congress.

This race received less media 

coverage than December’s special 
Senate 
election 
in 
Alabama, 

perhaps because the results have 
fewer immediate implications, 
with the GOP still claiming a large 
majority in the House despite 
the loss and the fact that Lamb 
will be up for reelection already 
in November.

While Doug Jones’s defeat 

of Roy Moore in Alabama’s 
Senate 
special 
election 
was 

more 
shocking, 
Lamb’s 

victory may have been more 
improbable. Lamb’s district was a 
conservative, reliably Republican 
district, 
and 
a 
district 
that 

President Donald Trump carried 
by 20 percentage points in 2016. 
Unlike Roy Moore’s candidacy, 
which was skewed by allegations 
of 
sexual 
assault, 
Saccone’s 

campaign avoided any serious 
scandal. 
And 
while 
Saccone 

wasn’t the strongest candidate, 
Republican-aligned super PACs 
poured millions of dollars into his 
campaign and he enjoyed the vocal 
support of Trump, Vice President 
Mike Pence and Congressional 
Republican leaders. In short, 
he should not have had any 
problem winning. Instead, he was 
defeated in a district so blatantly 
gerrymandered 
to 
benefit 

Republicans that it won’t even 
exist this November after the 
state Supreme Court ruled it had 
to be redrawn.

Lamb’s victory is ominous for 

Republicans. Democrats need to 

pick up 20 seats this November 
in order to retake the House, 
and there are 100 Republican-
held seats less conservative than 
this one. If districts like these 
are even somewhat competitive 
come Election Day, Democrats 
will almost assuredly take back 
the House and could do so by a 
large margin.

Republicans have rolled out 

several excuses in an effort to 
gloss over this loss. Some have 
pointed to polls that predicted 
a 4 to 6-point Lamb victory, 
claiming 
the 
close 
margin 

actually means that Saccone 
exceeded expectations, or that 
Trump, who campaigned for 
Saccone days prior to the election, 
nearly 
propelled 
Saccone 
to 

victory. These rationalizations 
are weak. Losing in a district 
that Trump won by 20 points 
cannot possibly be construed as 
exceeding expectations, unless 
Republicans 
have 
reconciled 

themselves to losing the House 
in spectacular fashion.

As for the idea that Trump 

somehow energized voters and 
boosted Saccone in the final 
days, it seems almost certain the 
president’s lackluster approval 
ratings contributed significantly 
to Saccone’s defeat. The election 
was not only a repudiation of 
Saccone, but also a repudiation of 
Trump. Saccone billed himself 
as “Trump before Trump was 
Trump,” so if Trumpism still 
appeals to the voters of the 18th 
district a year and a half removed 
from the 2016 election, Saccone 
should have won with ease. Even 
if Trump’s visit did mobilize 
some conservatives to turn out 
and vote, that does not negate the 
fact that Trump’s unpopularity 
has turned independents against 
him and invigorated his liberal 
opponents.

Others have tried to dismiss 

Lamb’s victory by claiming that he 
is actually a conservative, which is 
a rather specious argument. Lamb 
ran on a platform that supported 
universal health care, labor unions 
and legal medical marijuana, and 
opposed the GOP’s tax bill, cuts 
to Social Security and Trump’s 

border wall. Those are not 
conservative positions. Though 
Lamb is personally opposed to 
abortion and more centrist on 
gun control issues, he is pro-
choice on constitutional grounds 
(as are many Democrats) and 
supports stronger background 
checks on gun purchases. He 
is hardly the “pro-life, pro-gun 
conservative” that Paul Ryan 
tried to characterize him as after 
his victory.

From 
the 
Democratic 

perspective, 
Lamb’s 
victory 

underscores the fact that is there 
is no sole blueprint for success in 
these Congressional races. Jones 
won in Alabama on a solidly liberal 
platform. 
Lamb 
mixed 
both 

liberal and moderate positions 
to win in Pennsylvania. Though 
more moderate and more liberal 
Democratic candidates will surely 
clash in the primaries, this intra-
party conflict must stay contained 
to the primaries, and Democrats 
would be wise to embrace the 
ideological diversity within their 
party in their quest to retake the 
House. Lamb’s victory, coupled 
with a large number of retiring 
GOP incumbents, demonstrates 
that scores of House districts will 
be up for grabs in the fall. Even 
the Senate could be winnable if 
the cards fall just right.

Though it is easy to dismiss 

Lamb’s victory as an isolated and 
irrelevant event, it reflects deep 
voter dissatisfaction with the 
current balance of power that will 
indubitably influence the results of 
the 2018 midterms. Looking down 
the road, control of Congress 
will be critical to not only 
determining whether Trump 
can implement his legislative 
agenda but also determining 
the president’s fate if the special 
counsel, 
Robert 
Mueller’s 

investigation 
concludes 
that 

Trump colluded with Russia 
or obstructed justice. Given 
these implications, last week’s 
results in Pennsylvania should 
energize Democrats and alarm 
the Trump administration.

Lamb’s victory is a sign of what’s to come

LAURA DZUBAY

Daily Arts Writer

A group of teens, silently, 

hops a fence and slips into a 
beautiful glass house in Beverly 
Hills. Then, a wail of sirens 
breaks out, only it’s not sirens; 
it’s the punishingly loud treble 
of 
Sleigh 
Bells’s 

“Crown 
on 
the 

Ground.” The song 
wails and pulses as 
Sophia Coppola — 
queen of intertitles 
— 
immerses 
her 

audience 
in 
the 

world of mid-aught 
celebrity fan culture. 
Tabloid-yellow 
font is overlaid on 
thousand-dollar 
shoes 
and 
Louis 
Vuitton 

luggage. Our heroes (if you can 
call them that) approach the 
camera in slow motion. The 
flurry of cameras around them 
is mirrored in footage of Rachel 
Bilson and Paris Hilton walking 
the red carpet.

This is as 2009 as it gets. Of 

course, I’m talking about “The 
Bling Ring.”

The film follows fictionalized 

versions of a real-life cohort of 
teens who robbed celebrities 
in 2008 and 2009. Based on 
the Vanity Fair masterpiece 
by Nancy Jo Sales (yes, that 
Nancy Jo from that viral reality 
TV clip), much of the film’s 
dialogue is pulled from actual 
testimony from the kids. These 
kids are the product of a reality 
TV state, inundated with TMZ 
and with celebrities at their 
fingertips. A careful cocktail 
of late-stage capitalism and 
reality TV had crafted a very 
specific breed of celebrity as 
something that was accessible 
through material acquisition.

This 
is 
what 
celebrity 

culture 
looked 
like 
before 

Instagram, before we wanted 
our celebrities to be “human” 
or “relatable.”

Even in a world that 

demands a level of flash 
unusual for Coppola, she 
proves to have unparalleled 
empathy for her characters. 
She understands their world 
acutely and soundtracks the 
film with music that is both 
historically 
accurate 
and 

tonally appropriate.

The 
film’s 
soundtrack 

emphasizes 
the 
kind 
of 

aspirational lifestyle these 
children have been sold: one 
of excess. Adderall, designer 
bags, 
romanticized 
rehab 

stints and diamond-encrusted 
danger — this glut is mirrored 
in the sonic intensity of the 
soundtrack.

Early-aughts 
reality 
TV 

is a surreal beast. Shows 
like “Flavor of Love,” “The 
Simple Life” and “Bad Girls 
Club” paved the way for the 
Kardashians 
by 
marketing 

outrageous 
stunts 
and 

aesthetic 
extravagance. 

In tandem with the rise of 
TMZ, 
Facebook 
and 
the 

ever-increasing 
reach 
of 

the Internet, this type of 
entertainment 
demanded 

celebrities 
be 
bigger, 

louder 
and 
more 
visible. 

Celebrity was dictated not 
by talent, necessarily, but by 
performance stamina — who 
could be “on” all the time. In 
that vein, the Paris Hiltons 

and Lindsay Lohans of the 
world win. Their stars burn 
brighter (and explode bigger) 
than anyone else’s.

Coppola pairs them with their 

less obviously visible musical 

counterparts. 
The 

lure of artists like 
Azealia Banks and 
Kanye 
3West 
is 

built as much on 
their music as their 
public 
personas. 

In one of the film’s 
more iconic scenes, 
Emma Watson (“The 
Circle”) and Taissa 
Farmiga 
(“Rules 

Don’t Apply”) dance 

to Banks’s “212” in a club.

The 
two 
Kanye 
tracks 

Coppola picks are “All of the 
Lights” and “Power,” which 
are both buoyed 
by a throbbing, 
clappy bassline. 
The 
clapping 

in the back of 
“Power” sounds 
like 
the 
click 

of a camera as 
West sings: “No 
one man should 
have 
all 
that 

power.” 
He’s 

mad and jealous 
and also acutely 
self-aware 
— 

something 
the 

film is too. The 
song plays over 
the 
group 
as 

they stroll down the streets of 
Beverly Hills, sunglasses on and 
iced coffees in hand. They look, 
for a moment, to have finally 
become the people they’ve been 
robbing, but Coppola holds us 
here — shooting the scene in 
slow motion — and the longer 
we hold, the longer it feels like 

an act, nothing more than a 
good performance.

As they leave a club, at the 

peak of their spree, too drunk to 
drive but too young and high on 
adrenaline to call a cab, M.I.A.’s 
“Bad Girls” blares over the car 
speakers. The song’s refrain 
sums up their aspirations: “Live 
fast, die young, bad girls do it 
well.” This is the myth they’ve 
been sold and they desperately 
want to be mythologized. The 
precarity of their lives — both 
immediately, in the car and 
generally in their crimes — 
is nothing compared to the 
prospect of remembrance. Bad 
girls get photographed. Bad 
girls get remembered.

That’s 
the 
soundtrack’s 

brilliance, 
the 
balance 
it 

strikes 
between 
narrative 

reality — “Bad 
Girls” would be 
playing in that 
car — and tonal 
melancholy. 
There 
is 

something 
that 

feels inescapable 
about 
their 

situation. 
They 

feel like victims 
of 
a 
larger 

machine, 
a 

machine that has 
raised them on a 
myth.

Coppola 

scores the film 
such 
that 
we 

understand 
the 
appeal 
of 

celebrity glamour, of designer 
sunglasses and of Paris Hilton’s 
closet. But we also feel the 
tragedy and impossibility of this 
world, its falseness and careful 
creation. The kids are criminals, 
yes, but they’re also kids who 
believe, wholeheartedly, in a lie.

‘The Bling Ring’ scores

Adderall, 

designer bags, 
romanticized 
rehab stints 
and diamond-

encrusted danger

The old woman in the 

recording tells you she is 
from Chapel Hill, N.C. In the 
background, she plucks and 
strums at a guitar: You can 
picture her weathered fingers 
moving 
expertly 
over 
the 

strings as she smiles into the 
microphone, addressing the 
crowd. She was 85 years old, 
then living in Washington, 
D.C..

“I guess I’ll live there the 

rest of my life,” she says, 
“‘cause all my people are there 
— my daughter, her children, 
all her granddaughters. My 
grands and greats and greats, 
all there.”

The recording is a live 

version of “Freight Train,” 
from the album Live!, released 
in 
1998. 
The 
woman 
is 

Elizabeth Cotten, who was 
born in 1893 and wrote the 
song when she was only 11 
or 12-years-old. She taught 
herself to play the banjo 
and the guitar as a child, 
borrowing 
her 
brother’s 

instruments against his wishes 
and reversing them so that she 
could play them left-handed. 
At the age of 11, she saved up 
enough money doing domestic 
work — $3.75 — to buy her own 
guitar. She developed her own 
unique method of alternating 
the bass and the melody while 
she was playing, which came 
to be known as “Cotten style,” 
and was already a proficient 
guitar player and songwriter 
by her early teens.

It is hard for me to try to tell 

you about Elizabeth Cotten; 
it is impossible, I think, for 
anybody to adequately define 
or describe her, other than 
herself. She knew what she 
wanted and who she was, 
lived life on her own terms. 
She shares a prime example 
of this with us on another 
track from the same live 
album, “Elizabeth Story, et al., 
Honeybabe, Your Papa Cares 
For You.”

In the story, she explains, 

“When I was born in the 
world, 
they 
didn’t 
name 

me.” Her mother and father 
couldn’t agree on a name, so 
for the first few years of her 

life, she was known only as 
“Babe,” “Sis” and “Little Sis” 
by the people around her, up 
until her first day of school.

“When (the teacher) was 

calling the roll, she says, 
‘Little Sis Nevills.’ She said, 
‘Do you have a name?’” says 
Cotten in the recording. “I 
says, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘What 
is it?’ I said, ‘Elizabeth.’ So I 
named myself.”

Cotten began working as 

a maid alongside her mother 
when she was 13 and married 
her husband at 15. She had 
one daughter and spent many 
years working and moving 
around, having given up the 
guitar in favor of church and 
family obligations. Around 40 
years later, she was working 
in a department store one day 
when she helped a lost child 
find her mother. The child 
was Peggy Seeger, the mother 
Ruth Crawford Seeger. The 
Seeger family hired Cotten 
as a maid, which eventually 
prompted Cotten to remember 
her own musical past and to 
re-teach herself the guitar 
almost 
completely. 
The 

Seegers ultimately ended up 
helping Cotten record some 
of her early music; soon, she 
was performing publicly. She 
attracted fans during the folk 
revival of the early 1960s, even 
performing at the legendary 
Newport Folk Festival.

Because Cotten spent so 

much of her life unrecognized 
as a musician, she is already 
well into her 60s in most of the 
recordings of her that exist. 
This makes for a strange and 
quietly profound experience: 
When you listen to some of 
Elizabeth 
Cotten’s 
songs, 

you’re listening to songs that 
she wrote as a very young girl 
and sang for others only years 
later, as an older woman. The 
words are forward-looking, 
but also sometimes a little 
death-preoccupied, 
as 
folk 

songs often are. They’re songs 
that make you think about 
the beginning of your life and 
also the end of it, and how far 
you’ve come in between.

Perhaps nowhere is this 

conveyed 
more 
absolutely 

than 
in 
“Freight 
Train.” 

There are other, more popular 
recordings of the song — as 
well as covers of it by more 
popular artists — but Cotten’s 
Live! version is my favorite. 
You can hear her at age 85, after 
all those years of working and 
growing and being herself, all 
those experiences: The time 
she named herself Elizabeth, 
the time a taxi driver told 
her a joke while they were 
passing by a cemetery, the 
daughter she had and all of 
the grandchildren and great-
grandchildren who came after. 
And she’s singing “Freight 
Train,” a song she wrote as a 
young child, on the other side 
of all of those years.

It’s a simple song, really — a 

song about the train tracks that 
ran by her childhood home. 
After she runs through the 
opening chord progression, 
she asks the audience, “Y’all 

ever heard that before?” and 
they all laugh. Yes, they have. 
You can hear them singing the 
words along with her — open, 
honest words about the love 
that you can have for a little 
thing when that thing is in a 
place that you love.

They sing, “When I die, 

Lord, bury me deep / Way 
down on old Chestnut Street / 
So I can hear old Number Nine 
/ As she comes rolling by.” The 
sound of a roomful of people 
singing about a sentiment 
ordinarily so incommunicable, 
together, from memory, is 

the kind of thing that stays 
with a person. It’s a feeling 
like 
coming 
full 
circle, 

transcendent and communal 
in a way that folk music often 
reaches for, but rarely ever 
achieves so naturally.

It doesn’t feel right to sum 

up a reflection on Elizabeth 
Cotten with words of my 
own. She was, after all, a 
woman who made her own 
words, her own life, her own 
name. Her personality was 
aptly described by Folkways 
as 
“quietly 
commanding,” 

and, fittingly, her music is 
emotional, natural, quiet and 
strong. The fact that we have 
her story and her music still 
available to us is a treasure too 
often overlooked. What old 
woman becomes a powerful 
presence in the world of folk 
music well into her 60s? What 
little girl teaches herself how 
to play the guitar like an 
expert, upside-down and left-
handed? What little girl names 
herself?

In the live recording of 

“Washington Blues,” Cotten 
recounts the early process of 
learning how to play the guitar 
and trying to get her brother 
to help her. She had to figure 
out how to play the instrument 
in a way that made sense for 
her, turning it upside-down 
and playing using her own 
method. Her brother told her 
to try changing the strings, 
but it ended up making the 
guitar sound even worse than 
it had before.

“So no one help me,” she 

says, and the audience laughs 
and claps. “Everything I play 
for y’all tonight, I give myself 
credit, ‘cause nobody need 
help me.”

No pressure, but you need 
to know Elizabeth Cotten

VESTAPOL

think, for anybody 

to adequately

her, other than

The fact that we

BOOK NOTEBOOK

Clive 
Cussler 
was 
my 

first favorite author. I’m not 
embarrassed, and I don’t think I 
should be. For those unfamiliar 
with Cussler’s work, he is a 
prolific novelist (and underwater 
explorer) 
who 
has 
written 

more than seventy action and 
adventure books. He’s not a high-
brow literary darling by any 
means; his style and content is 
more like a lovechild of Stephen 
Coonts and Stephen King.

There are many reasons not to 

like Cussler’s books. It’s chock-
full of flat female characters (who 
are always thin and conveniently 
beautiful and single), and the few 
non-white characters are either 
villains, have very small roles 
or both. Still, there’s something 
about Cussler’s writing that 
draws the reader in. It’s not 
that I really wanted to stay 
up on Wednesday until 2 a.m. 
rereading a book about the lost 
tomb of Genghis Khan, but there 
I was.

Cussler has a formula, and it 

works: 
Charismatic 
scientist, 

plus witty sidekick, plus vintage 
cars, plus beautiful women, 
plus shipwrecks, plus nefarious 
criminals plotting something big. 
It’s like James Bond, but better (I 
should be honest: I’ve never seen 
a James Bond movie). It’s got 
car chases! It’s got nonpartisan 
political intrigue! The historic 
and factual foundations are thin 
at best and often nonexistent! 
It also has very few explicit sex 
scenes 
(Cussler 
co-authored 

many of his books with his 
son), little social resonance and 
boatloads (get it?) of dramatic 
tension. There’s even a very 
well-funded federal bureau of 
underwater investigation, which 
is probably more fantastical 
now than it was in the ’70s, 
when Cussler first invented the 
fictional National Underwater 
and Marine Agency (a cross 
between NASA and the National 
Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 

Administration). 
Interestingly, 

Cussler used the royalties from 
his books to found a private non-

profit with the same name in 
1979.

Cussler has a quite a few series’ 

that he works on: The Dirk Pitt 
Adventures, The NUMA Files, 
The Oregon Files, The Isaac 
Bell Adventures and The Fargo 
Adventures. Each one follows 
the hijinks of a different cast 
of characters: a freighter that’s 
actually a high tech mystery-
solving ship, early 20th-century 

naval detective or a pair of 
treasure hunters. Cussler is at his 
best with his first series, The Dirk 
Pitt Adventures. Dirk is a George 
Clooney lookalike, as well as 
a scientist and an adventurer. 
He lives in an airplane hangar 
outside of Washington, D.C. with 
his collection of old cars. His 
girlfriend is a young, idealistic 
congresswoman 
(though 

conveniently that relationship 
never stops him from some sort 
of romantic involvement with 
the stunning women who pop up 
as he fights evil across the globe). 
In short, he’s cool. The women 
want him and the men want to 
be him.

The Dirk Pitt Adventures 

are predictable yet thrillingly 
ridiculous. 
One 
particularly 

absurd plot revolves around a 
family of genetically-engineered 
neo-Nazis 
who 
plan 
to 

destabilize an ice shelf in order 
to wipe out everyone except 
themselves. They hope to sail 
around on huge, luxurious cruise 
ships until they can repopulate 
the world. Of course, it’s up to 
Dirk to save humanity, and he 
does. He always, always does. 
The stakes are so insanely high 
that they become low; it’s never 
whether Dirk will be the hero, it’s 
how — and the how is incredibly 
entertaining.

I first started listening to Clive 

Cussler audiobooks with my 
mom. Even when we were only 
in the car for a few minutes, we’d 
pop in a CD and become absorbed 
with the adventures Cussler 
describes (read, of course, by 
the one and only Scott Brick). 
This tradition became a way 
to connect without speaking, 
a shared fantasy world that we 
could inhabit and then discuss at 
length. Last week, I listened to a 
Dirk Pitt novel using OverDrive, 
an audiobook and ebook app, 
and for a moment I was 11-years-
old again, thrilled at the novelty 
of riding in the front seat and 
dreading having to get out of the 
car and step back into the real 
world.

What I realized recently is 

that my mom was definitely not 
a Cussler fan before I began 
checking out his books and 
audiobooks from the local library. 
My mom likes nonfiction about 
Buddhism 
and 
neuroscience. 

She 
likes 
Alice 
Hoffman, 

Elizabeth 
Strout 
and 
Mary 

Oliver. Whatever the predicted 
Clive Cussler fan demographic 
is, my mom is not in it. Rather, 
it was for me that she put up 
with these hours and hours of 
audiobooks, a concession that 
eventually led to a genuine (if 
limited) enjoyment of adventure 
novels. Clive Cussler is certainly 
not for everyone, but he deserves 
a chance. I’ll always love his 
books. He managed to engineer 
a bridge between the childhood 
days when my mother read books 
out loud to me and now, when the 
two of us read separately, silently, 
side by side.

In defense of Clive Cussler

Chilean foreign film “A Fantastic 

Woman” completely lives up to its 
title, proving itself to be fantastic, 
if not outstanding. “A Fantastic 
Woman” is a consummate example 
of giving minority gender identity 
stories a voice in film, especially 
with 
visionary 
direction 
by 

Chilean-Argentinian 
director 

Sebastián Lelio (“Gloria”) and 
a breathtaking performance by 
Daniela Vega (“The Guest”). It 
is no shocker as to why it rivaled 
American films this past season, 
resulting in an Oscar win for Best 
Foreign Language Film. 

A story to be revered and 

admired, “A Fantastic Woman” 
underscores the complexities and 
complications of love and loss, and 
the quest for personal and gender 
identity. Marina, played by Vega, 
is a transgender woman living as 
a singer in Chile, dating an older, 
wealthier 
divorcée, 
Orlando 

(Francisco Reyes, “Neruda”). But 
despite some tropes of relationships 
with a vast age difference, Marina 
doesn’t use Orlando for his money. 
Marina doesn’t care about any of 
that. In fact, the only possession 
she desires after his passing is the 
dog they share. Orlando provides 
her with one thing that no one else 

can: He sees her. When Orlando 
suddenly suffers an aneurysm and 
dies, Marina is forced to confront 
prejudices and suffer abuse from 
Orlando’s family. They try and tear 
her down, but she perseveres.

“A Fantastic Woman” is also a 

tale about self-preservation and 
resistance. Lelio doesn’t give us 
much of a glimpse into Marina’s 
backstory 
because 
we 
don’t 

require it. The film’s dialogue is 

simple and deliberate. Based on 
Vega’s performance — its nuance, 
tenderness and strength — we can 
infer it hasn’t been easy for her, but 
it’s not overly sentimental and it 
doesn’t make us feel pity for her. She 
is ridiculed by Orlando’s ex-wife, 
who calls her a “chimera,” or a 
fire-breathing monster in Greek 
mythology. The investigator who 
questions her after Orlando dies 
refuses to call her Marina because 
he knows she is trans. But none of 
this surprises Marina; she doesn’t 
expect anything from anyone, 
which makes the loss of her love, 

her one piece of hope, all the more 
heartbreaking. Vega herself, who 
brings Marina’s fortitude to life, is 
a big trans rights crusader in South 
America. This will not be Vega’s 
last stellar performance.

Vega tells the story through 

her acting, while the rest of the 
story is told through avant-garde 
cinematography by Lelio that 
elevates 
the 
film’s 
aesthetics 

into an artful and abstract piece 
of work. Despite some sleepy 
moments, daytime shots are met 
with sensual, dream-like night 
sequences with colored lights 
and glitter that reflect Marina’s 
deepest desires of peace — to be 
met back with her love and be on 
the stage. Sparkly choreographed 
sequences of Marina dancing and 
singing, breaking the fourth wall 
and distancing from the reality of 
the piece, don’t allow us to forget 
about her suffering. And the 
quite striking and unusual shot of 
Marina walking as the wind pushes 
back on her, used in the trailer, is an 
in-your-face visual allegory of her 
defiance in a world that repeatedly 
tries to knock her down.

Really, “A Fantastic Woman” is 

about not judging others. It urges 
us to be accepting and to open 
our minds and our hearts. It’s 
heartbreaking, at times too tragic 
to even watch, but by the end, we’re 
all on Marina’s side.

Daniela Vega transcends 
in ‘A Fantastic Woman’

FILM REVIEW

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS 

“A Fantastic 

Woman”

Sony Pictures 

Classics

State Theatre

He’s not a high-

brow literary 
darling by any 
means; his style 

and content 
is more like a 
lovechild of 

Stephen Coonts 

and Stephen King.

The year 2002 was quite a 

wild time in pop culture. Justin 
and Britney called it quits for 
good, Nickelback had one of the 
biggest songs of the year, Apple 
released its second-generation 
iPod with 20 whole gigabytes of 
storage and a small show called 
“American Idol” made its debut 
on television screens across the 
nation.

Since then, a lot has changed. 

Justin 
Timberlake 
is 
now 

known more for a botched 
Super Bowl performance than 
his early-aughts relationship, 
Nickelback is nothing more 
than an Internet meme, Apple 
released the iPhone X and is 
on the verge of taking over the 
world and “American Idol”... is 
on its 16th season.

That’s right. Much to the 

surprise of many — including 
myself — “American Idol” is 
still going on. Gone are the days 
of Simon, Paula and Randy. 
Now in their places sit Luke 
Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel 
Richie. Oh, but Ryan Seacrest is 
still there — some things never 
change.

With ratings that have been 

on a constant decline since 
season seven, one begins to 
wonder why “American Idol” 
even bothers to go on. Though 
a 
highly-rated 
“farewell 

season” premiered on Fox in 
2015, the competition show 

has 
been 
resurrected 
on 

ABC 
for 
its 
latest 
season. 

Yet it is no longer producing 
hit-making 
superstars 
like 

season 
one 
winner 
Kelly 

Clarkson 
and 
season 
four 

winner 
Carrie 
Underwood. 

Instead, it’s become a show 
unacknowledged by a general 
audience, only coming into the 
public eye only when it stirs up 
controversy.

So why does “American Idol” 

persist? Why can’t cable TV 
just let it die? Maybe it’s just 
the way the industry works, but 
maybe it’s something bigger. 
Americans 
are 
suckers 
for 

the “self-made man.” It’s the 
reason why every trust-fund 
baby politician weaves stories 
of how their great-great-great 
grandfather’s 
tailoring 
shop 

helped them get into Harvard 
Law. And it’s the reason that 
shows like “American Idol” stay 
on the air.

While most of America has 

changed in the past 16 years, 
“American Idol” has stayed 
consistent. 
Despite 
a 
new 

channel and a new set of judges, 
everything from the format 
of the show to the contestants 
are identical to the series circa 
2002. Picture the quintessential 
“American 
Idol” 
contestant: 

some 24-year-old white boy 
with a guitar, lower-middle 
class parents — maybe raised 
by a single mother to really 
spice things up — who just quit 
his 9-to-5 job to pursue his real 
dream of becoming a star. He’s 

still showing up to auditions, 
and the American people eat it 
up. They cheer for him, pray for 
him and want to see him win, 
because if he can make it big, 
maybe anybody can.

Killing 
“American 
Idol” 

basically kills the American 
Dream. The American Dream is 
more than just the go-to answer 
when you’re in an American 
literature class but haven’t read 
the book and the professor asks 
what “The Death of a Salesman” 
is all about. It’s the foundation 
of shows like “American Idol” 
and “The X Factor” and “The 
Voice,” shows that have fallen 
out of popularity to programs 
centered around the rich and 
the fabulous. It may be a stretch, 
but Americans still need to 
trick themselves into believing 
that anyone, no matter their 
background, can succeed. Just 
the existence of “American 
Idol” perpetuates this false 
reality that anyone can become 
whatever they dream to be, 
whether it’s a star, a CEO or a 
senator.

Is 
“American 
Idol” 
an 

elaborate propaganda machine 
used to blind Americans to the 
true societal barriers that keep 
us secured in our socioeconomic 
and cultural bubbles? Doubtful. 
It is more representative of a 
national culture that longs for 
hopeful stories of the home-
grown boy who made it big. 
And if reality refuses to give 
that to us, at least Ryan Seacrest 
always will.

Idol’ & letting things die

Like your typical pastry shop, 

turnover is the name of the game for 
the No. 19 Michigan softball team 
this year.

Out goes right-hander Megan 

Betsa and one of the most 
accomplished senior classes in 
program history. In comes a 
freshman class with two top-10 
recruits and another player inside 
FloSoftball.com’s Top 100. The 
Wolverines are also looking to 
turn over a new leaf after falling to 
Michigan State in the first round 
of the Big Ten Tournament and 
losing to Washington in the NCAA 
Regional last season.

Here is The Daily’s position by 

position breakdown of the 2018 
Michigan softball team:

Pitching:
Although 
the 
Wolverines 

lost Betsa, it would be a mistake 
to 
confuse 
Michigan’s 
youth 

movement in the circle for a 
complete rebuild.

Freshman ace and left-hander 

Meghan Beaubien — who boasts a 
15-2 record — is not short on talent 
by any means. Beaubien comes to 

Ann Arbor with an already-rich 
pedigree: the former Saint Mary 
Catholic Central pitcher led her 
high school to three consecutive 
Michigan 
state 
championships 

from 2015-17 while compiling 1,442 
strikeouts.

And so far, Beaubien looks like 

everything one would expect the 
No. 6 prospect in the country to 
look like. In her first career start, 
the freshman tossed a no-hitter 
and has not allowed more than five 
hits in any game that she pitched 
seven or more innings. Beaubien 
boasts a 0.91 earned-run average. 
She has been the Big Ten Pitcher of 
the Week three times already this 
season.

While right-hander Sara Schaefer 

(2-3) might not be as consistently 
dominant at Beaubien, the other 
freshman 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 

rotation has been productive as 
well. Schaefer has a 1.45 ERA, and in 
her most recent start against Robert 
Morris, notched a perfect game in 
five innings. Schaefer, though, has 
only pitched one complete game, as 
Hutchins often opts to take her out 
of the circle in jams.

With a veteran like senior right-

hander Tera Blanco (5-1), however, 

Hutchins has that luxury. Although 
Blanco and Schaefer have a similar 
amount of innings pitched, Blanco 
gives Michigan another steady 
hand and a veteran presence for the 
two freshmen. Blanco spent more 
time at pitcher last year than she 
ever did before, and posted career-
highs in most categories.

First Base:
When Blanco isn’t pitching, 

the senior often starts at first 
base. Although her numbers took 
a dip last year in comparison to 
her breakout sophomore year, 
Blanco’s hitting this year is trending 
towards the latter. She is currently 
batting .325 and has a .587 slugging 
percentage. When Blanco is in the 
circle, senior Aidan Falk slides in 
from the outfield to first base, and 
both are backed up by freshman Lou 
Allan, the former-No. 8 prospect 
in the country. As a positional unit, 
the first basemen have provided 
stability for the Wolverines on 
defense, giving up only one error so 
far this season.

Second Base:
Junior Faith Canfield broke out 

in a big way last year and remains 
the leader for Michigan at second 
base. She is not only the most 
consistent hitter for the Wolverines, 
but has also established herself as 
the batter most likely to catch fire in 
a given series. At the Judi Garman 
Classic last month, Canfield not 
only hit .579/.859 over the course 
of five games but piled on hits in 
eleven consecutive at-bats.

So far, the junior paces the team 

in hits, at-bats, home runs, batting 
average, runs batted in, runs and 
total bases. Look for Canfield, who 
has already been named National 
Player of the Week honors this 
season, to earn a spot on the All-
Big Ten First Team for the second 
consecutive year, and perhaps even 
an All-American nomination.

Third Base/Shortstop:
The Wolverines have a few 

established players on the left side 
of the infield, but Hutchins rotates a 
whole crew of players through third 
base and shortstop. Sophomore 
Madison Uden’s 12 games last 
season as Michigan’s designated 
hitter has helped her to become 
the second leading hitter for the 
Wolverines with a .383 batting 
average. Most notably, Uden’s plate 
presence saw her draw a walk-off 
walk against Ball State. Uden shifts 
between both infield positions, 
alternating with freshmen and 
Puerto Rico junior national team 
member Natalie Rodriguez at 
shortstop, and freshman Taylor 
Bump, junior Alex Sobczak and 
senior Taylor Swearingen at third 
base. 

Catcher:
Junior Katie Alexander earned 

the starting role at catcher last 
season and should be a strong 
veteran presence for Michigan’s 
two young pitchers. Alexander 
caught three no-hitters last season 
and has guided the pitching staff 
to two already this year, including 
a perfect game. Sobczak also had 
18 starts last season at catcher, has 
more RBI than Alexander and 
boasts a .998 fielding percentage. 
But besides for RBI, she has lower 
hitting stats across the board than 
the starting Alexander.

Outfield:
The group of players guarding 

the fences out deep in Alumni Field 
is the most experienced positional 
unit as a whole. Along with Falk 
and her 19 RBI, Michigan returns 
junior All Second Team Big Ten 
outfielder Natalie Peters, who had 
17 multi-hit games last year, and 
42-game starter junior Courtney 
Richardson. The outfielders have 
committed just two errors on the 
year.

Big Ten preview: Ohio State poised to contend for title

The Michigan softball team is 

currently second in the Big Ten in 
winning percentage, trailing only 
No. 18 Ohio State. They appear to 
be on a collision course with the 
Buckeyes at the beginning of May 
for a series that could determine the 
conference crown.

Outside 
of 
these 
two 

teams, 
Minnesota, 
Nebraska, 

Northwestern and Illinois have 
all gotten off to solid starts this 
season. However, Michigan will 
face none of these teams during the 
regular season. The question for the 
Wolverines will be whether they 
can keep up the consistency that 
they have been yearning for since 
before last season.

The Daily breaks down the teams 

that will contend for the Big Ten 
Title if Michigan fails to maintain 
its current level of play.

No. 18 Ohio State (19-4)
Heading into Big Ten play as the 

only other ranked team, Ohio State 
is currently the Wolverines’ biggest 
competitor for the conference title.

The Buckeyes finished third 

in the conference last season and 
lost to Minnesota in the Big Ten 
Championship. So far, they are 
exceeding preseason expectations 
as they came into the season 
unranked. They appear to be locked 
in on avenging last season’s loss.

Ohio State’s offense ranks fifth in 

the Big Ten in batting average, and 
it relies heavily on the long ball. It 
leads the conference in home runs 
with 29 while having played just 23 
games so far — the third fewest in 
the Big Ten.

Standout junior Lilli Piper has 

spearheaded the offense by staking 
her claim as the best hitter in the 
conference. She is currently batting 
.452 with 12 home runs, 33 RBI and 
is slugging 1.012 –– leading the Big 
Ten in each of those categories. The 
next best hitter, in fact, is actually a 
pitcher. With senior right-hander 
Shelby McCombs batting a measly 
.300 with 5 home runs and 14 RBI 
compared to Piper’s stellar batting 
stats, the Buckeyes’ offense begins 
and ends with Piper.

The lack of depth on offense 

is compensated by a collective 
ERA of 2.07 — good for third in 

the Big Ten. This is mostly due to 
the performance of junior right-
hander Morgan Ray who has the 
seventh-best ERA in the conference 
at 1.49 with a record of 11-3 in 17 
appearances. Ray’s play has carried 
over from last season as she posted a 
0.91 ERA in her last 10 appearances 
in 2017.

McCombs has posted a 2.68 

ERA, going 8-1 in 13 appearances.

Ohio State has not played a 

particularly tough schedule thus 
far. It has faced off against just 
two ranked opponents, UCLA and 
Oklahoma, being shut out by both. 
That’s not to say that Ohio State has 
not recorded any quality victories. 
The Buckeyes defeated Louisville 
and Wichita State, both of whom 
have been ranked just outside 
the top 25 in recent polls, twice 
this season — including shutting 
out each team once in four total 
matchups.

Their 
series 
against 

Northwestern and Michigan will 
make or break their hopes for the 
conference title.

Minnesota (17-11)
Minnesota is coming off one of 

its best seasons in program history 
in which it earned the No. 1 ranking 
for the first time and finished with 
a 56-6 record. This season has not 
faired quite as well for the Gophers 
who have nearly doubled their 2017 
loss total.

The team has hit a few bumps 

along the road under the leadership 
of first-year head coach, Jamie 
Trachsel, after Jessica Allister left 
the Twin Cities for the sunnier 
roads of Stanford, California to take 
on the managerial duties at her alma 
mater.

Minnesota has seen a drop in the 

performance of several key players 
from last season on offense.

Last year’s Freshman of the 

Year and Big Ten Player of the Year, 
Kendly Lindaman, has not lived up 
to the behemoth expectations she 
set with last season’s performance. 
Her average is down to .301, which 
pales in comparison to last season’s 
.426 average. She is still the team’s 
biggest power threat and leads the 
team with nine home runs — the 
second most in the Big Ten — and a 
slugging percentage of .675.

The team’s best hitter has been 

freshman Ellee Jensen who is 

batting .370. Despite leading the 
team in batting average, she has 
only tallied three extra base hits and 
three RBI over 28 games.

The biggest disappointment for 

the Gophers this season, however, 
has been the drop off in production 
from junior Maddie Houlihan who 
went from batting .396 with 50 RBI 
last season to a paltry .238 with four 
RBI in all 28 games this season.

Minnesota’s pitching staff boasts 

a 2.43 ERA which ranks fourth in 
the conference. Last season, it relied 
heavily on then-senior right-hander 
Sara Groenewegen, who went 31-4 
with a 0.63 ERA. Sophomore Amber 
Fiser has started the majority of the 
games for the Gophers this season 
and is 11-6 with a 2.06 ERA in 21 
appearances. She is looking to build 
off of last season in which she went 
14-0 with a 1.68 ERA.

The team has struggled against 

quality competition this season, 
going 2-7 against ranked opponents. 
However, it showed last season 
what kind of team it can be when 
its offense plays up to its potential. 
Minnesota is a dark horse in the 
conference if it can come close to 
replicating last season’s production.

Nebraska (20-9)
Continuity is the name of the 

game for Nebraska, which returned 
10 starters and appears to be making 
the biggest improvement from last 
season in which it finished 24-29 
— failing to make a postseason 
appearance.

This season, the Cornhuskers 

have recorded wins against Brigham 
Young and Utah — both of whom 
were ranked at the time. Their most 
impressive victory, however, came 
against No. 8 Texas A&M. They have 

had one of the toughest schedules 
so far in the Big Ten, facing several 
ranked opponents including No. 1 
Washington, No. 3 UCLA and No. 
4 Oklahoma. Although they are 
unranked, they received eight votes 
in the latest poll.

Senior Kaylan Jablonski is the 

team’s best hitter and pitcher. She is 
batting .368 with 17 RBI, and in the 
circle, has posted a 2.51 ERA with a 
13-5 record.

As a team, Nebraska ranks fourth 

in batting average and populates the 
bottom half of the conference with 
a 3.31 ERA.

Northwestern (16-9)
Northwestern — winners of eight 

in a row and 11 of the last 13 — is 
entering Big Ten play as the second 
hottest team in the conference.

The team’s most impressive 

victory of the season came against 
No. 15 Alabama on March 4, which 
kick-started the team’s current win 
streak. 

Freshman 
standout 
Rachel 

Lewis is the main source of offensive 
production for the Wildcats, batting 
.329 with 6 HR and 29 RBI. Senior 
leadoff hitter Sabrina Rabin is 
contributing to the third-ranked 
offense with a .366 batting average 
and 24 runs scored.

Northwestern’s pitching staff is 

posting a 3.04 ERA, which ranks 
seventh in the Big Ten. Sophomore 
Morgan Newport and freshman 
Kenna Wilkey have spearheaded 
the effort, by posting ERAs of 2.25 
and 2.88, respectively.

If the Wildcats can maintain 

their recent play, they can contend 
in the Big Ten.

‘M’ covering all the bases
T

here were a lot of empty 
plates early in the sea-
son.

In turn, 

Carol 
Hutchins 
switched to 
emphasizing 
a simplifica-
tion of the 
game so that 
the No. 17 
Michigan 
softball team 
could find a 
way to cover all of its bases.

“(Front-line focus) simplifies 

the battlefield,” Hutchins said. 
“... When it’s an exciting, tense 
game and there’s a lot of emo-
tion going on, they start hav-
ing too many thoughts in their 
mind, and that’s not good soft-
ball. (You) gotta stay focused 
on something small.”

To make things simple, the 

basis of the game essentially 
breaks down to three things: 
pitching, batting and the result.

And the Wolverines had con-

cerns with all three.

However, with an ongoing 

16-game win streak, the team 
has found a way to cover all the 
bases it couldn’t initially.

The main question coming 

into the season was who was 
going to replace three-time 
All-American Megan Betsa, the 
ace pitcher last year. Upon her 
graduation, a hole opened up, 
along with several questions. 
Would it be former All-Amer-
ican senior right hander Tera 
Blanco, FloSoftball’s 2017 Hot 
100 Rankings’ No. 6 prospect 
left hander Meghan Beaubien 
or another pitcher on the deep 
roster? Were they good enough 
to replace Betsa?

After the opening weekend 

tournament, those questions 
were answered. Throwing a 
six-inning no-hitter in just her 
second game — and her first 
career start — Beaubien all but 
proved herself as the strikeout 
pitcher Michigan sought to 
replace its former star.

And in a Feb. 10 game 

against South Florida — one 
that ended with a score dif-
ferential of one — Blanco was 
pulled for Beaubien, a move 
that Hutchins deemed one 
she thought gave them the 
best chance to win, solidify-
ing Beaubien’s status as the 
ace. Currently holding a 0.92 
earned-run average, she has 
not only backed up the trust 
put in her by the coaching staff 
but has exceeded expecta-
tions — earning three Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week and Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Week honors 
thus far.

However, the Wolverines 

didn’t just find an ace. They 
found the full house with 
much-needed depth.

In contrast to the one-two 

punch it had with Betsa and 
Blanco, Michigan added two 
freshman, Beaubien and right 
hander Sarah Schaefer, into the 
fold to make it a three-woman 
rotation between the freshmen 
and Blanco.

Over the course of the sea-

son, Blanco brought her ERA 
from 2.30 to 1.36, as well as 
carrying a 1.27 ERA during 
the 16-game win streak, mak-
ing her a viable second option. 
However, as recently as last 
weekend, Schaefer showed her 
ability to make her mark on the 
mound, possessing a 0.00 ERA 
for her two-game stand, with 
one match being a five-inning 
perfect game.

The conflict is no longer who 

will fill the hole left by Betsa, 
but who should be getting the 
innings.

Meanwhile, the void left by 

graduates wasn’t the issue on 
offense. The pieces were there 
— they just weren’t connecting.

Batting has always been a 

strength of the Wolverines. 
The year prior, the team 
knocked in 343 runs on 488 
hits with a .325 team batting 
average. The year before that, 
466 runs on 531 hits with a .349 
team batting average.

This year, the offense came 

out struggling only to spark 
under the conviction of the 

players to improve.

“It’s a huge success for us 

that we’re hitting a lot bet-
ter,” said sophomore infielder 
Madison Uden. “We may not 
be producing as much runs as 
we want to but we’re definitely 
producing more. And I think 
we’re just making a lot more 
solid contact, swinging early in 
the count.”

Before the win streak, the 

offense produced a measly 2.75 
runs per game, including four 
shutouts. The inconsistency 
forced Hutchins to take a new 
approach. Make it a team 
effort. Make it simple. Make 
it fun.

“You know, when you lose 

a game, you, in a sense, maybe 
feel uptight, or like under pres-
sure,” said junior catcher Katie 
Alexander, “like, it has to feel 
like, ‘I have to do this, I have to 
win.’ And I just don’t think that 
was what we were thinking in 
that game.

“We were thinking, like, 

‘Let’s have fun, and be the 
team that we are.’ And when 
we are hitting the ball, like, 
we’re having fun, so that was 
something we really took to 
heart.”

Just like that, the individual 

pieces started to click.

Junior second baseman 

Faith Canfield, who was a pre-
season National Player of the 
Year candidate, had already 
been the one beacon in the 
batting lineup. However, since 
losing to Virginia Tech, she’s 
upped her game further, hit-
ting four home runs, as well as 
batting .474.

Her performances saw her 

named Division 1 NCAA Player 
of the Week, as well as Big Ten 
Player of the Week. She led 
the way to overall improved 
performances by the Wolverine 
batters — especially from the 
veterans of the team. Blanco, 
who once batted .404, began to 
return to form as she currently 
bats .325 with four home runs. 
Alexander is batting a career-
high .302 as well as tying a 
career-high for home runs 
with four. Senior utility player 
Aidan Falk also has four home 
runs, while hitting .349.

It was evident the team as 

a whole felt more in tune with 
one another, choosing to have 
fun instead of being engulfed 
by the pressure to perform in 
line with the standards of the 
elite program.

And the lack of tension paid 

off.

Against then-No. 8 Baylor, 

the team countered the game 
delay by singing in the rain. 
The mood of the team was 
in high spirits, as it went on 
to record its first weekend 
sweep, including wins over two 
ranked foes. What a glorious 
feeling.

The offensive turnaround is 

proof of unity. Early in the sea-
son, lack of chemistry showed 
through stranded base runners 
and untimely outs. Just when 
one player found their groove, 
another couldn’t, costing 
games which the Wolverines 
should have won.

But winning makes every-

thing better.

However, there was a worry 

it wasn’t that way for a seg-
ment of the season. Through 
those first 12 games, doubt 
crept in.

Was this team even worse 

than last year’s — whose early 
exit in the postseason was 
viewed as a disappointment? 
Was Michigan’s tenth-ranked 
recruiting class not enough?

The frenzy of criticism was 

quieted through the most 
effective method — winning.

When Michigan graduated 

its star pitcher, it replaced 
her with talent and much 
needed depth. When it felt 
the pressure of failing to meet 
expectations, it bounced back 
by winning 16 straight. When 
the offense just couldn’t click, 
Michigan found a way to cover 
all the bases.

For Blanco, life has led to this moment

Seventh inning. Bases loaded. 

Two outs. A national championship 
on the line.

Tera Blanco and the Firecrackers 

— a travel team coached by her dad, 
Jeff — were playing for the U-16 
national title. Blanco, then a high 
school freshman, had pitched a 
nine-inning complete game the day 
before to send her team to the finals.

Blanco was the best pitcher on 

the team, but it was another girl’s 
turn to start. Instead, she was the 
designated player. But Jeff told his 
daughter to be ready. If trouble 
struck, they would need her.

“She’d come in from the bullpen,” 

Jeff said. “She’d be in the other 
end of the dugout and she’d just be 
throwing the ball into her glove, 
popping the glove really hard, just 
kind of staying loose.

“But it also kind of looked like 

letting me know, ‘Hey, I’m ready. 
Anytime you need me, I’m ready to 
go in.’ ”

And indeed, he needed her. The 

bases were juiced in the bottom 
of the seventh and suddenly, the 
game — and the glory — hung in the 
balance.

The time had come. Blanco stood 

in the circle, fired and got the final 
out like there was nothing to it.

The Firecrackers were national 

champions.

It was par for the course for a 

player seemingly born ready for the 
moment. And when that moment 
came, one thing was certain — she 
would savor every bit of it.

***
You won’t find a lot of Michigan 

fans in Huntington Beach, Calif., 
but the Blancos were an exception. 
Jeff’s 
grandfather 
was 
from 

Michigan and raised him a die-hard 
fan, so it was only natural that his 
daughters also grew up cheering for 
the Wolverines. Blanco would wake 
up early Saturday mornings and 
turn on the football games — that is, 
when she didn’t have softball.

The Blancos caught the softball 

bug early. Kayla — born in 1993 
— began playing first, and Tera — 
born in 1996 — decided she wanted 
to play too. By the age of four, she 
was playing t-ball and by five she 
had started softball. By six, she was 
taking pitching lessons.

“She was always trying to stay 

on pace with her older sister,” 
Jeff said. “ … She was always very 
competitive.”

And for Jeff — who got into 

coaching because he wanted to be 
involved with his daughters’ softball 
careers — the natural next step was 
to introduce his girls to Michigan 
softball. Luckily, the Wolverines 
played annually in the Judi Garman 
Classic, a tournament in nearby 
Fullerton, Calif. Jeff took them to 
watch every year.

In 2005, when Blanco was nine, 

she watched as the team she had 
started to love became the first from 
a cold-weather climate to ever win 
the Women’s College World Series.

***
It wasn’t long before Blanco had 

the opportunity to keep pace with 
her sister. Sometimes, Kayla’s travel 
team would be missing a player, so 
Jeff turned to his other daughter to 
fill in. It didn’t matter that she was 
three years younger.

After all, competition had always 

fueled Blanco, and this was no 
exception. Had she not been so 
tiny, no one would have known 
anything was out of the ordinary. 
But that’s the thing. She was small, 
so everyone knew. And that made 
her all the more impressive.

During one game, Blanco stood 

in left field as a high fly ball carried 
towards the corner. She tracked the 
ball, laid out and made the diving 
catch like there was nothing to it.

The umpire took off his mask and 

applauded.

It wasn’t a surprise that the 

teams Blanco played on had so much 
success — not just because of her 
talent at both pitching and hitting, 
but because she was a natural leader, 
even then.

The accolades racked up. The 

national championship with the 
Firecrackers. A national runner-up 
the following year. Back-to-back 
league championships at Marina 
High School.

“The kids looked up to her from 

minute one,” said Michelle Spencer, 
a former assistant coach at Marina. 
“She really was the person that 
everyone on the field looked up to. 
And that’s hard sometimes, as a kid, 

to deal with that. But she handled it 
so well.”

Lots of colleges would have 

clamored for a player like Blanco, 
as she was one of the top two-way 
players in the country.

But she was set on Michigan.
That’s the irony of it. This was 

California, a state home to several 
powerhouse programs — in fact, at 
least one school from the state has 
advanced to the Women’s College 
World Series all but four years that 
Blanco has been alive. But those 
schools couldn’t have her.

“She walked into us as a freshman 

and said, ‘I’m going to Michigan,’ ” 
Spencer said. “ … She was dead set 
on Michigan from the moment I 
met her.”

The adamancy makes sense. 

Blanco, after all, had seen the team 
ascend to the highest levels. She 
had autographs from her favorite 
Wolverines and a picture with 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins and 
former star right-hander Jordan 
Taylor hanging at home. One of her 
coaches had even alerted Hutchins 
to her existence.

“He contacted us and said, ‘We’ve 

got this kid and she always wears 
Michigan stuff, and you should look 
at her because she’s pretty good,’ ” 
Hutchins said.

Hutchins’ 
own 
evaluation 

confirmed the recommendation. 
She wanted Blanco primarily as a 
pitcher, albeit one that would also 
hit. Blanco insisted she wanted to 
play shortstop when she wasn’t in 
the circle.

Eventually, she relented — first 

base would be her position when she 
wasn’t pitching — but it only further 
proved what Hutchins already 
knew: Blanco was a competitor, 
exactly the kind of player she was 
looking for.

Blanco got her offer freshman 

year. She remains one of the 
youngest players Hutchins has 
ever recruited. But before she 
committed, Jeff insisted that Blanco 
visit campus in the winter, when 
freezing temperatures and swirling 
snow would be in full force.

“My dad wanted to know 

if I could handle the cold and 
everything,” Blanco said. “ … I was 
able to handle it.”

She never had a doubt. 
That 
was 
Blanco, 
attacking 

every challenge handed to her — 
whether it was playing against 
girls three years older, securing a 
national championship or surviving 
the frozen tundra of a Michigan 
January. She joined the Wolverines 
knowing she wouldn’t necessarily 
be the main attraction. This was, 
after all, a team with three All-
Americans in outfielder Sierra 
Lawrence, 
right-hander 
Megan 

Betsa and second baseman Sierra 
Romero. But that didn’t deter her. 
Instead, she fed off the competition.

“The environment was super 

competitive, and I think that’s 
what made our team really 
great,” Blanco said. “And we 
had great leaders that pushed 
— I don’t even think they 
knew if they were leading 
or not — but just pushing the 
team with their athletic ability. 
… Just coming to the field and 
(thinking) ‘Oh, I gotta reach this 
standard that they’re at.’ ”

In part, she did just that. She 

immediately earned the starting 

first base job and ran with it, 
starting 64 of the Wolverines’ 68 
games there. But she wasn’t the 
two-way star who had dazzled 
coaches, parents and umpires alike, 
as an arm injury limited her to just 
five appearances in the circle.

“She really had taken some steps 

back,” Hutchins said. “We had to let 
her heal and then build her back. … 
And it took a couple years to get her 
back.”

It was frustrating for an athlete 

accustomed to being one of the best. 
But it added fuel to her fire.

Blanco’s sophomore year, she 

exploded as one of the top first 
basemen in the country. She 
finished the season in the top 25 
nationally in on-base percentage 
and garnered an All-America First 
Team nod, helping lead Michigan 
to a 52-7 record. On the mound, she 
still wasn’t quite the player she had 
been, but she began getting starts 
and putting it together.

She had always been a player who 

injected her personality into the 
game, and it shined through on the 
field and off it.

Blanco and then-catcher Lauren 

Connell both loved SpongeBob. So 
they gave her changeup a name: the 
leedle, after a scene where Patrick 
continuously 
yells 
the 
phrase 

“leedle leedle leedle lee.” It stuck, 
becoming a joke among the rest of 
the team.

“It’s kind of a weird changeup, 

so they call it a leedle,” said junior 
catcher Katie Alexander. “ … We 
actually got (pitching coach) Jen 
(Brundage) Patrick glasses one year 
for a coach’s gift.”

That’s Blanco, a player who finds 

success by letting loose. This is an 
athlete as fierce as she is fun-loving, 
as confident as she is relaxed. It’s a 
lethal combination.

“She’s more of like, the goofy first 

baseman,” said senior utility player 
Aidan Falk, who plays first base 
when Blanco is on the mound. “She 
brings a lot of personality to the 
field. And then, I love playing first 
base when she’s pitching because 
I just talk to her the whole time … 
she definitely has a more spunky 
(attitude).”

That 
attitude 

was the key to her 
breakout. 
She 

approached 
every at-bat 
with 
a 

swagger 
that struck 
fear 
into 

the 
hearts 

and 
minds 

of 
pitchers 

everywhere, and 
for good reason, 
given 
how 

often 
she 

practically launched the ball into 
orbit.

Sometimes, that swagger even 

intimidated her teammates.

“There’s a … couple of us on the 

team (who) when we were first 
freshmen (thought) ‘Wow, Tera, I 
didn’t think you liked me, like, when 
I met you,’” Alexander said. “ … You 
were just so scared because you 
thought she hated you.”

But they were wrong. Blanco 

is the player who brings the team 
into a huddle and checks to make 
sure everyone is having fun. She’s 
the player who jokes around with 
her teammates mid-game. She’s the 
player who named her changeup 
after a cartoon.

“A lot of our team is just, we get 

so caught up in the outcome,” said 
senior designated player Amanda 
Vargas. “ … She can help us, like, dial 
it back.”

In Michigan’s first game of the 

2016 Women’s College World Series, 
the game was scoreless through five 
innings. Blanco stepped to the plate 
with the bases loaded. Do or die 
time.

She smacked a double to right 

field. The Wolverines wound up 
winning, 2-0.

Perhaps she was already the 

player she had looked up to just the 
year before: leading not through 
conscious 
effort, 
but 
through 

her athletic feats and infectious 
enthusiasm for the game alike.

***
But the very competitiveness 

that makes Blanco great can also 
be her biggest downfall. She holds 
herself to such a high standard that 
sometimes even she can forget her 
fun-loving philosophy.

“Like any player, she can second-

guess herself, and it’s hard,” Jeff 
said. “ … Sometimes if things aren’t 
going perfect, she can get a little bit 
frustrated.”

And that was the story of her 

junior year.

In her first season as a full two-

way player, Blanco had a .460 
on-base percentage and a 2.30 
earned-run average. She was named 
to the All-Big Ten First Team and 

the 
All-Great 
Lakes 

Region First Team. 

It sounds like a 

success, but for 

Blanco, it was a 
slump.

She slugged 

just .475, 

nearly 

a 300-point 

drop from the 
year 
before. 

Her 
batting 

average and 
on-base 
percentage 
also 
plummeted. 
And 
her 

pitching 
stats, 
while 

good, 
belied 

her status as 
a 
can’t-miss 

prospect.

“I think that 

maybe 
why 
my 

stats and everything went down last 
year is I just probably wasn’t in the 
right mindset,” Blanco said at the 
beginning of the season. “ … I think 
that I was just thinking too much at 
the plate.”

But her dad knew her better than 

anyone. He knew she had bigger 
things in her. He knew her swagger 
was contagious. And he knew he 
had just the right medicine.

So he sent her video of the 

majestic home runs and ringing 
doubles of her sophomore year. It 
reminded her that she was still that 
girl.

***
Technically 
speaking, 
Jeff 

stopped being Blanco’s coach after 
her freshman year of high school, 
but in reality, he never stopped 
coaching her.

He made his way to as many 

games as he could. Not just the Judi 
Garman Classic, but games all over 
the country, from Ann Arbor to 
Boca Raton. Now that she’s a senior, 
he has plans to attend all but 10.

Jeff sends his daughter a text 

before every game letting her know 
he loves her, wishing her luck and 
offering motivation. He’ll be the 
first to acknowledge that he’s her 
number one fan.

And now, he coaches a new 

crop of young softball players, but 
he constantly thinks of Blanco. 
He peruses video of professional 
ballplayers 
and 
motivational 

speakers. He wonders if it might help 
one of his players. Then he wonders 
if it might help his daughter.

“If I see something in her game 

that maybe she’s not having success 
with or she might be struggling with 
or trying to get better at, and I see 
some video or piece of information, 
I’ll send that to her,” Jeff said. “ … 
Just, ‘Hey, take a look at this, see 
what you think, you know, might be 
enough to put you in the right frame 
of mind.’ ”

After her games, Blanco and 

Jeff often hang out and relax in 
the hotel. They talk about — what 
else? — softball. Then, they go out to 
dinner. Blanco loves sushi. Jeff’s not 
a fan of it, but he takes her anyway.

***
Blanco’s magnetic personality 

coupled with her unparalleled work 
ethic and her dad’s influence always 
created the perfect recipe for a 

leader. But now she has the final 

ingredient: Experience.

“She’s 
always 
been 

really confident in her 
game, but her confidence 

continually grows,” Falk 

said. “She’s definitely taken the 

role of kind of like, the caretaker for 
the younger girls. … She really is like, 
‘Hey, this is what you’re doing, this 
is what you’ve gotta do,’ and it’s good 
to have, like, another perspective as 
well as the coach’s.”

In the circle, the spotlight is off 

Blanco. Instead, it’s focused directly 
on freshman left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien, 
the 
young 
phenom 

heralded as the one to fill Betsa’s 
shoes. Blanco’s role is subtler.

With Betsa graduated, the role 

as the leader of the pitching staff 
is Blanco’s. Now more than ever, 
it’s a vital responsibility, since the 
other two pitchers — Beaubien and 
right-hander Sarah Schaefer — are 
freshmen. Blanco knows what it’s 
like to come to college and struggle 
before finding your place. She, 

herself, is evidence that it’s a lesson 
even the best of freshmen need to 
learn.

“She 
definitely 
gave 
(the 

freshmen), like, a perspective of 
what it was like freshman year,” 
Vargas said, “because you can either 
come in and you play scared and 
afraid because you don’t know what 
it’s gonna be like as a freshman, 
or, I’m positive she gave them the 
outlook of just come, give your 
best, and really just … go full force. 
There’s really nothing to lose at this 
point.”

Of course, Blanco is no slouch 

herself in the circle, sporting a 1.36 
ERA. And her experience playing 
both ways informs the advice she 
gives her teammates. She talks 
softball with the coaches, and 
sometimes they even go to her to 
help develop a game plan.

“Tera has some of the best 

softball IQ that I’ve ever had on my 
team,” Hutchins said. “Her softball 
savvy is up there with anybody’s. 
She just understands the game.”

And Blanco’s been through it all 

— the highs and the lows. She was 
always well-versed in the physical 
aspects of softball. Now she knows 
the mental ones, too.

“They go from being girls with 

potential to women with no limits,” 
Hutchins said. “And that’s her.”

***
On March 1, Blanco was back 

at the tournament she grew up 
attending. It was her last Judi 
Garman Classic as a player, the end 
of an era. Her family, of course, was 
there too.

Because it was spring break, the 

team had spent nine days together 
on the road, traveling from Texas to 
California. Before the tournament, 
many of the local players had gone 
home. Not Blanco. Instead, she took 
the rest of the team to Huntington 
Beach and served as their unofficial 
tour guide. After all, her teammates 
had become a second family.

In the first game against Loyola 

Marymount, the offensive woes 
that had plagued Michigan the 
whole season — and really, going 
back to last year — had returned in 
full force. Beaubien allowed a two-
run home run in the second inning. 
The Wolverines responded with a 
whimper.

But 
Blanco 
single-handedly 

changed the trajectory of the game 
and, with it, the tournament.

In the bottom of the fifth 

inning with a runner on third and 
Michigan trailing, 2-1, she dug in at 
the plate and ripped a single down 
the left field line. The game was tied.

Then, in the bottom of the 

seventh, she stepped up again 
with runners on first and second 
and the prospect of extra innings 
looming. She lofted a line drive into 
the right center gap to walk off the 
Wolverines.

Perhaps it was no coincidence 

that after the tournament, several 
players noted a difference that 
weekend: they were looser, freer, 
having more fun.

It was just one of many finite 

moments 
Blanco 
will 
now 

experience as her collegiate career 
comes to a close.

There comes a point in a college 

athlete’s career when everything 
turns into a last. Her last year 
becomes her last game becomes her 
last hurrah.

And for Blanco, it’s her last season 

of living her dream. Ever since she 
was the little left fielder making 
acrobatic catches, her dream was 
to play softball for Michigan. And 
now, with the clock running down, 
there’s no better time to put last year 
behind her and show the world who 
Tera Blanco really is.

“I wanna win everything that 

we can this year,” Blanco said. “ … I 
wanna be a Big Ten champ, Big Ten 
Tournament champ, and just keep 
winning.”

But the fact that Blanco’s dream 

has already come true doesn’t mean 
it’s all over. Just as most people 
dream multiple times per night 
before waking up and snapping 
back to reality, this season won’t be 
the end for Blanco and the game she 
loves.

“I definitely wanna stay within 

softball,” she said. “Maybe, like, give 
lessons, coach, that kinda stuff.”

Because that’s Blanco, who’s 

always led with her knowledge, 
her confidence, her personality. It 
seems only natural that coaching is 
the next step.

After all, for Blanco, it doesn’t 

matter what the question is. Softball 
is the answer.

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | MARCH 21, 2018


W

hen I walk Down the streets 
of this

College-town I see 

Hands smashing beer bottles
Friends only of one-another
Screaming chants alien
To my covered ears

I began my freshman year at the 

University of Michigan bright-eyed 
and ready to learn. As the years went 
on, however, I started to realize how 
diversity, equity and inclusion are just 
empty words in a University campaign 
slogan. This was also the first time 
I really felt unsafe as a Muslim in 
America, with incidents of hate only 
getting closer to home, when walking 
home late at night posed real dangers. 
I watched as students, professors and 
administrators dismissed acts of hate 
toward Muslims and other minorities on 
campus, instead of holding one another 
to a higher standard.

I have learned
To be wary
Strain to see
Three streets ahead of me
To see if I feel anyone Is a danger to me
My head covered In a scarf
That tells you I don’t belong here

I 
now 
anticipate 
discriminatory 

actions and hate crimes as if they are 
inevitable. Unfortunately, in my four 
years on campus, I have yet to be proven 
wrong. I quickly learned that students 
of color at the University have to work 
together to create a collective voice for 
there to be any change. I watched as 
students and faculty around me ignored 
the repercussions of such hate. I first 
realized this when major news outlets 
blamed Muslim students for trying to 
“infringe on freedom of speech” over 
the movie “American Sniper” and the 
University failed to protect its students. 
I then began to realize that the story of 
being unheard was interlinked among 
all underrepresented communities on 
campus, and sought to change this.

Posters plastered with DIVERSITY 

EQUITY and INCLUSION ALL FOR YOU

Empty slogans I have yet to see 

become a part of this city.

Though students at the University 

are required to take a class that fulfills 
the Race and Ethnicity requirement, 
the courses are often broad and loosely 
related to race and ethnicity.

I noticed that, although I tried to 

share my own stories as well as the 
experiences of other students of color 
on campus in The Michigan Daily, 
it simply was not enough to create a 
change in the student body.

It is too easy to stay self-segregated 

by race, class and ideology on a campus 
this large. It is much too late to be 
teaching students about diversity if 
they have never learned about it in 
a meaningful way in earlier their 
education.

Every incident of hate may have 

brought me down, but it also taught 
me to self-advocate as a Muslim 
student and as a reporter and writer 
of others’ stories. As I saw these 
incidents unravel around me, I started 

to develop an eye for cases of inequity 
everywhere I went — in and outside of 
Ann Arbor. I started to write, which 
gave me the ability to be articulate 
in writing, especially when voicing 
my opinions was difficult for me. I 
cannot stop talking about inequity, 
and because I believe that issues of 
diversity and equity should be taught 
much earlier, I decided to enter the 
School of Education for secondary 
teaching.

What I found in education, however, 

was even more shocking. As I interned 
in different middle and high schools, 
I saw the stark contrast between 
resources in low-income areas and 
the other schools in my rotation. 
Education, regardless of what level, 
is not equitable across America, and 
without an equitable allocation of 
resources, teaching about these issues 
can feel hypocritical.

As a student-teacher, I live a double-

life, trying to balance teaching with 
learning at the University, and I can 

see how the education system is flawed 
in ways that creates inequalities 
in education, often heavily based 
on demographics. The more I learn 
about students and their perspectives 
on the world, the more important I 
realize it is to both teach and practice 
equity across America. And the first 
step in doing this is to stop being 
afraid to try to make changes for a 
better future.

As I move on to becoming a teacher 

and leaving the University, I am 
grateful for what I have learned from 
others because I chose to seek people 
who 
have 
different 
perspectives 

than me, and I hope that I can make 
change, one class at a time.

And I am getting worn from speaking 

into a void, while trying to hold myself 
together in this peculiar world.

But I am trying to ignite that fire inside 

of me.

I am trying to ignite that fire inside of 

me.

Brews Through: Shinola Cafe 

C

harles Bradley’s “Slow Love” 
plays on a record through 
the chatter of coffee shop 

talk, 
clicking 
of 
keyboards 
and 

turning of pages.

“Just you and me / Us against the 

world / Baby I love you / This a evil 
world we live in”

It seeps into the brick walls, the 

black wall paint and plush leather 
couches. Shinola Cafe is a secret, 
both a mancave and luxury getaway 
all at once. It’s almost intimidating at 
first glance. Hidden in the basement 
of Detroit watch and leather brand 
Shinola, the coffee shop is a place 
where time seems to stop — the 
music, the fading red bricks, the black 
interior with minimal lighting — even 
the people seem to be posing for the 
cover of an independent film. 

Though it’s my first time at Shinola 

Cafe, I had been meaning to come here 
much sooner. I decided it was time I 
tried something new. Everything will 
be new in six weeks once I graduate; 
might as well start now with coffee. 
I’ve found myself going to the same 
cafe to get my morning caffeine kick 
and croissant, a different coffee shop 
to write my thesis after classes and at 
night and a different one on weekends 
for uninterrupted hours of work. 
Everything about Shinola Cafe is new 
to me. I don’t think I’ve ever even 
stepped foot into a Shinola store, but 
I like that it feels like I’ve been here 
before — it’s timeless in that way.

I’ve been in a lull recently — six 

weeks until commencement, 20 days 
until the last day of undergrad, slowly 
realizing I’ll be leaving Ann Arbor 
and the kindness of midwestern 
people. The inevitable ending of 
this chapter of my life is only a few 
pages away, and honestly, “Call Me 
By Your Name” has got me feeling 
something heavy in my gut since I 
first saw it. I sway between being 
ready to leave and not being ready at 
all. I go from childish excitement for 
my post-undergraduate life to nearly 
debilitating anxiety. It’s scary to see 
the finish line without knowing much 
of what lies beyond it.

I get a cappuccino. The menu is 

small and printed on gray paper that 
makes it hard to read. It’s not a place 
for customized syrupy lattes and 
alternative milk choices, although 
they do have almond milk. No one is a 
coffee amateur here and it seems like 
everyone has a go-to espresso drink. 
It’s simple, which is a nice change.

The barista brings my drink and 

we make small talk about pastries 

in the glass case. He says they’re 
from the People’s Food Co-op in Ann 
Arbor. I sit at a large, industrial-
looking metal table with an antique 
lamp in the corner. It gives off a nice 
glow onto the brick. The rest of the 
basement feels a bit like a black hole; 
it’s sprawled and dark so I can hardly 
see where the cushions end and the 
wall begins. It’s chic and cozy at the 
same time. The basement is spacious 
— I’m a little bummed I didn’t come 
here sooner.

“God, we wasted so many days,” 

Elio says in “Call Me By Your Name”.

I’m realizing again how special 

Ann Arbor is. There are so many 
hidden places that I never thought to 
explore in my first couple years at the 
University. I used to almost exclusively 
go to Starbucks or other chains, simply 
because I knew the menu better or 
didn’t want to go anywhere new alone. 
But this year, especially now, I’ve 
enjoyed being by myself in this city — 
coffee shops, independent films at the 
State Theatre, boutique stores. Ann 
Arbor has so much to offer.

No, it’s not a city in northern Italy 

with secret lakes and hidden patches 
of grass; no Hellenistic sculptures 
are to be found at the bottom of the 
Huron River, as far as we know. But 
there is a part of life in Ann Arbor 
that’s sophisticated and romantic 
like that. Or I guess you could make 
it feel that way if you choose. There is 
great cinema, performing arts, food 
and thoughtful conversation all over 
town.

I didn’t take advantage of the cafe 

lifestyle that defines a part of college 
life here. Anyone who knows me now 
knows I’d rather be writing, reading 
or conversing at a local coffee shop 
than getting wasted on a Saturday 
night. Not that one is better than 
the other; there are benefits to both. 
I know I’m missing a chapter of 
“The College Experience” because I 
refuse to go to Skeeps. I’d rather go 
to bed early to wake up and get to my 
favorite cafe when it opens, because 
I need that corner table or that one 
chair that faces the window with the 
Irish pub across the street. Honestly, 

I can’t tell you why because I don’t 
understand my obsession either.

I get a chocolate croissant to go, but 

it’s gone before I know it.

I don’t think we think or feel 

enough. Our phones and computers 
do the thinking, but little time do 
we spend with our thoughts, talking 
about the things that matter, writing 
about these weights or joys. I find 
that for me, I do this best in places 
like this. I notice more. I feel more. 
I think I become more sensitized to 
myself and recognize I go too fast; 
that I need to savor more. Here, I 
enjoy what it feels like to put words 
on paper, to listen to the atmosphere 
and enjoy the chaos that is now, that is 
tomorrow, that is the future. There’s 
something sentimental and nostalgic 
about it — knowing that T.S. Elliot, F. 
Scott Fitzergald and J.K. Rowling all 
wrote in places like this, as if I could 
understand the workings of their 
minds by being in a similar space. But 
maybe it’s a start.

What a waste we don’t go to places 

like Shinola Cafe more often.

Purple Squirrel, but only human?

by Yoshiko Iwai, Columnist

I

wake up to the fifth alarm of 
12. It’s more out of irritation — 
to stop the droning, electronic 
waterfalls — than it is to open 

the door and let any ray of sun into my 
windowless room. I slowly put my head 
back down when the sixth alarm starts. 
I groan, mildly irritated, and turn off the 
remaining six. I repeat this, with a dev-
ilish satisfaction that the others won’t 
ring this time. But now I can’t fall asleep 
because the guilt has started its morning 
rounds. I can’t go back to bed, because 
the only thing I can do is wake up. I tell 
myself I’ve worked too hard to slack. But 
it’s too late for that.

This is the best time of my life, every-

one says — college. That’s not to say I dis-
like the way things are. I pick two majors 
I like, dance and neuroscience. I like to 
study. I look forward to buying an over-
priced latte on the weekend to study at 
a favorite library and doodle on the cor-
ners of my notebook. I live in a high-rise 
with four of my friends. This is a luxury. 
I can’t hear the sorority chants or the 
beer cans getting smashed on the pave-
ment at the crack of dawn.

I figure out what I want early on. 

Besides the Bachelor of Fine Arts and 
Bachelor of Science, I decide to pursue 
a career in medicine. To say the medi-
cal school application process is gru-
eling is an understatement. There is a 
list of things they expect you to enjoy 
— research, volunteering, maintaining 
a high grade point average, random acts 
of kindness, a breadth of life experi-
ence that gives depth to your otherwise 
two-dimensional college character — 
maturity that exceeds your age and an 
impressive MCAT score.

I do all of the things the ultimate pre-

med guide tells me to do: I volunteer at 
C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital and joined 
a medical fraternity. I shadow surgeons 
and go to guest speaker seminars, and 
I work in a neurology laboratory for 
Parkinson’s disease. I go to yoga and 
weekend boxing classes with my cur-
rent boss — she is the kind of mentor I 
always wanted. I have my own research 
project, my own rats, my own drugs and 
protocols. Every morning at seven, I take 
the elevator four levels underground and 
poke around rat brains for my thesis. 
I still don’t know what a “dissertation” 
really means.

But doing this isn’t enough. There’s the 

unspoken “purple squirrel” or “it” factor 
— as it’s called in show business — you 

need in order to stand out in a crowd of 
overqualified people applying to medical 
school. Originally, the “purple squirrel” 
was used in human resource recruitment 
to describe “the one” true person for the 
job. Now, there’s a general understand-
ing that double-edged sword because the 
purple squirrel is simply unobtainable, 
and waiting for Prince Charming is a 
wasted expenditure.

I overload my class-

es. There’s not much 
overlap in class con-
tent for neuroscience 
and dance, so I take 
the things I need to 
graduate. I get per-
mission to enroll past 
the 18-credit maxi-
mum — 18, 24, 21, 24, 
21, 23. My days are 
never 
shorter 
than 

nine hours. Eleven-
hour average. I burn 
more calories running 
from place to place 
than I do in my dance 
classes.

Three semesters ago, I took a nonfic-

tion writing class, and 75 percent of the 
students were writers for The Michigan 
Daily. One semester in, they asked if I 
wanted to be an editor — yes, of course 
I’ll take it.

I sleep little. I work a lot. I rely on my 

phone too much. I’m not sure how I’d do 
without it or my computer — it’s bad. I 
want to reread “The Shallows” and do 
a no-electronics cleanse, but I know I’d 
crack instantly like the hard-boiled eggs 
I throw in the pot too strongly in the 
morning. I don’t have time to stress, or 
if I do, it’s so constant I’m immune to 
it. Except when I perform. Even after 
18 years, I nearly throw up every time. 
Sometimes, I wonder if I have abnormal-
ly high cortisol levels. It makes me want 
to do a finger prick and test my blood 
content. I have a phlebotomy license. So 
pricking people is no problem, but I can’t 
stand it on myself. I hate needles. I’m one 
that person that cleans blood off other 
people’s wounds, but can’t stand the 
thought of a paper cut on my own finger.

I overload, I overbook, I overdo, I 

overextend, I overindulge, I overwhelm 
and occasionally, I overcome. I don’t 
know how not to. There’s no question 
of whether to do or not to do, only how. 
Everyone says these are supposed to be 
the best four years of my life. That this, 

right now, is what freedom feels like. I 
think it’s stupid not to make maximum 
use of the resources I have.

But recently, I question what it means 

to be the purple squirrel. Like the squir-
rels on campus that scurry around my 
feet and occasionally get caught in the 
front wheel of my bicycle, going in cir-
cles until my brakes finally kick in and 
they run off in a daze.

I can’t tell if I 

do the things I do 
because 
I 
truly 

enjoy them, or if 
it’s to fulfill the 
unrealistic 
goal 

of 
becoming 
the 

perfect candidate. 
To say that I don’t 
enjoy the things I 
do would be a com-
plete lie, because I 
do. I wouldn’t cut 
sleep if I didn’t. 
But every now and 
then, when I stop 
in my tracks and 

attempt to process what I’m doing — 
the moment after the squirrel hops off 
my bicycle tire and scurries away like 
he didn’t almost die — I have no direct 
answer.

The purple squirrel feels more and 

more like an oxymoron. “Be unique,” 
said the Teacher, the Adviser, the Admis-
sions Office, the Counselor, the Friend, 
the Boyfriend, the Parent. I do as I’m 
told. We all do as we’re told because we 
desperately want it. 
And yet, all too often, 
I find myself ques-
tioning the status quo. 
How different can we 
be if our goal is to be 
the same thing — to be 
different?

There has to be a 

point when the sto-
ries 
start 
sounding 

the same, they bleed 
together, 
and 
these 

“differences” fall into 
similar 
patterns 
of 

forced 
connections 

and reflections. The 
stories are continuously reinforced by 
friends and family who already have the 
M.D. email signature, the golden Ph.D. 
nameplate on the front of their desk, 
the diploma hung next to photos of their 
two kids and the golden Labradoodle, 

the path they etched out of their prided 
“uniqueness” and brilliance.

But as philosophical or not as it 

sounds, I’ve come to the realization that 
every version of an aspiring doctor has to 
have already happened. And with that, 
I accept that another dancer-writer-
physician already exists. So the question 
becomes more about why I still continue 
this grueling narrative when I’d merely 
be a replica of another purple squirrel.
I

’ve had a number of epiphanies 
recently. They come when I least 
expect it — at the cash register, 
when I’m brushing my teeth, 

strolling through the hardware store, 
waiting for hard-boiled eggs to cook. I 
usually ignore these thoughts because 
any “thinking” outside of classes and 
homework takes up time, and that time 
will cut into my sleep schedule. But 
something has been urging me to listen 
more closely to these cosmic insights. 
Maybe that’s why the bags under my eyes 
won’t go away.

I was biking somewhere — I can’t 

remember where — when I decide to 
finally listen to one of these epiphanies. 
I steer my bike clear of pedestrians in 
the Diag and find a spot by the Randall 
Laboratory. The concrete is cool from the 
rain. I worry the rough surface will make 
pills on my leggings. The breeze is cool 
against my ears.

In the light, I notice rust on the edges 

of my kickstand. I just got my bike for my 
birthday last summer. I thought this sort 
of chemical reaction took much longer 

— it was a silver, 
too reflective and 
almost embarrass-
ingly new just yes-
terday.

The same sum-

mer I got my bike, 
the Randall Lab 
was 
under 
con-

struction. A huge 
fence surrounded 
the entrance of the 
Diag. Three con-
secutive 90-degree 
turns 
made 
rid-

ing my new bike 
treacherous — I hit 

four people. I feel like the fence was there 
just yesterday — I just can’t remember 
when they took it down. It was in front of 
the Engineering Arch. The one with the 
myth: If you kiss someone under the arch 
before your 21st birthday, you will marry 

them. After a late night in the library, my 
friend and I were walking through when 
he asked if I wanted a kiss. I said yes, and 
he gave me a piece of chocolate. It’s like it 
happened yesterday, but we haven’t spo-
ken in two years.

I slide sideways to get a peek at the 

arch. The backs of my thighs catch the 
rough cement surface, and I know I’ve 
wrecked my leggings. I didn’t even plan 
on wearing them. I went to bed think-
ing today was a denim day. It didn’t even 
cross my mind to open the denim drawer 
this morning.

When I sit still like this, I finally feel. 

Like I’ve been holding my breath this 
entire time, suffocating. I deflate my 
chest in a sigh. I just got a haircut, but 
it’s back to mid-rib length again. I make 
a note in my phone to contact the salon. 
The checklist is extensive, accumulat-
ing red squares that indicate they’re 
late. A pixelated pile of promises. That’s 
what it feels like sometimes — a never-
ending list. Like a mythical pond that 
self-augments, my list is bottomless. 
Not mimosas.

When I sit still like this, I notice that 

I’ve forgotten everyday occurrences. 
Details slip away, and I don’t like that I 
need digital confirmation to fully remem-
ber what I saw or heard. It should be in 
my head, not on a phone or a memory 
card that could be destroyed by a cup of 
coffee. Swiped in seconds.

When I sit still, I remember that I’m in 

college and this is the most fun I’ll ever 
have, according to popular belief. That 
this is the last test run, the last dress 
rehearsal for the “real world.” This is all 

I get. And all at once, the pang of guilt is 
back. Even though I’ve checked off all of 
the things on my list for yesterday and 
today before going to bed, I don’t remem-
ber why or how. I don’t have short-term 
memory loss, as far as I know, but it’s not 
like I have time to see a doctor. I trudge 
through my day like 
it’s 
nothing 
more 

than a task — friends, 
homework, 
my 
job 

alike. If I mindlessly 
pursue these tasks, 
then what differenti-
ates them from the 
chores I do at home? 
Isn’t the point of col-
lege — the most excit-
ing four years of life 
— to build an infra-
structure of places 
and people to fill with 
memories to re-expe-
rience later on? So 
that I’ll have some-
thing to hold on to 
when I am too old to 
walk these places myself? The architec-
tural structure is there, but what if I have 
nothing to fill it with? No coffee table, 
no couches, no refrigerator, no mirrors, 
no windows. It’s a model house nobody 
wants to buy.

If I neglect to be in the “now,” then all 

of this is for naught. That if I am not pres-
ent, then this entire game is a loss. I want 
to type it up — “be present and remem-
ber.” I take out my phone to add it to the 
checklist — remember what? If it’s just 
another thing on a list and it’s something 

that could merely be checked off in the 
middle of the night, while I wait for the 
laundry machine to buzz, when lecture 
gets out 20 minutes early, then what’s the 
point? How do you add, “Be alive” to an 
agenda?

Classes get out and the Diag starts to 

fill with people. A 
swarm 
of 
bodies 

weaving 
together 

like 
the 
back 
of 

intricate 
embroi-

dery. 
Everyone 

moving from point 
A to point B, half 
of them looking at 
their 
phones, 
the 

first 
official 
days 

of spring. I want 
to scream, to cause 
some sort of mag-
netic 
field 
that’ll 

create 
a 
momen-

tary power outage 
in mobile devices, 
just enough so they 
would look up. So I 

would look up.

That night, I notice blood in my stool. It 

doesn’t hit me until my hand is hovering 
on the flush lever and something stops me. 
It’s simultaneously disgusting, confus-
ing and just weird. I hover over the toilet 
bowl, not knowing what to do but to rely 
on Google. It tells me all sorts of things 
from eating too many beets to late-stage 
intestinal cancer.

I panic, because it’s noticeably red and 

there’s a history of cancer in my fam-
ily. I see my grandpa’s sunken cheeks, the 
transparent skin clinging to his jaundiced 
eye sockets. I panic and don’t know how to 
stop. The skin around my neck is too tight 
and I feel like I’m suffocating. Because my 
life might be ending. The entire doctor’s 
visit is painted in my head — the X-ray, the 
MRI, the blood tests over and over. I know 
I won’t look good with no hair. There’s a 
bump on the back of my skull that I feel 
every time I put my hair into a ponytail. 
It sticks out like a cone. My head will look 
lumpy when I’m bald, and my face will be 
expressionless without my eyebrows that 
imagine would fall out from chemo. I’m 
too pale to be paler, but I imagine my skin 
turning bluer. There will be a scar down 
my stomach and the countless ab work-
outs will be fruitless because the doctor 
won’t be able to remove the tumor. They’ll 
call my time of death and tell their daugh-
ters to cherish their every day.

What will they say about me when I 

die? That I did so many things? Or that 
I didn’t go to the bar that one night, or 
go skinny dipping in the lake? That I did 
so much but it was worthless because I 
died and that was it? There was noth-
ing to remember me with but the exten-
sive checklist, a graveyard of gray Xs 
and empty red boxes. There would be 
so many still unchecked and someone 
would say how unfortunate it was that 
they were never completed. If I died 

today, I wouldn’t be remembered. If I 
died today, I wouldn’t be happy.

I flush the toilet and watch the red 

spiral in the water, winding further and 
further down like gymnastics ribbons.
I

n my Monday night class on per-
forming arts management, we 
talk about marketing ourselves 
as artists. Jonathan, our profes-

sor and former musician, explains tricks 
of winning over an interview. He hands 
out a pro-con worksheet for us to list our 
strengths and weaknesses.

I write, like I always do, my weakness: 

I spread myself thin — I overload, I over-
book, I overdo, I overextend. I don’t sleep 
enough. We hand in our forms.

“You’d be surprised to know that 95 

percent of students say ‘doing too many 
things’ and ‘committing to too much’ is 
their weakness,” Jonathan says. And that 
once everyone has that same weakness, 
you’re no longer the purple squirrel with 
a somewhat inspiring commitment prob-
lem, but you just become one of the many.

But what if it’s true? What if I work too 

many jobs, hold too many positions, say 
‘yes’ to every performance, every inde-
pendent project? That in reality, I can’t 
let go of my schedule because it is a part 
of my identity and justifies my failures — 
at least I tried. At least I took advantage 
of what I could and didn’t waste what was 
there. That this same trait is my weakness 
because it detracts from the way I live, 
the way I neglect to be in the “now.” How 
I am nearly done with the best part of my 
life and have failed at being present. It is 
a flaw in the overall equation of this qual-
ity of life that I will regret tomorrow and 
everyday after I leave this sanctuary. He 
hands back our worksheets.

“Be the purple squirrel, show me why 

your weakness is different,” Jonathan’s 
voice hovers over the sound of scratching 
pens and paper. “I want to hire you to be 
the next superstars of the world.”

I erase my answer and scribble: Bad at 

telling jokes, too serious most of the time.

After class, I bike home on a route 

I don’t usually take. I go by the hospi-
tal and loop around the downtown area 
where the trees are illuminated. I take 
out my phone from my pocket and scroll 
through my list while steering with the 
other hand. I check off two things and 
put my phone away. I think I enjoy biking 
because it forces me to breathe.

The night is brisk enough for a heavy 

coat. I regret the thin cardigan that’s long 
enough to get caught in the tires. Imagine 
the headline on the morning news: “Girl 
dies from wardrobe accident on bike.” I 
still can’t let go of the handles with both 
hands like my brother used to do. I try 
every now and then, but I need at least 
one to stay balanced.

I keep pedaling, one foot, then the 

other, until I get to the library next to the 
arch by the old construction site. I can 
see the silhouette of the tower on top of 
the building, the bell swaying inside it. I 
wonder if I’ve ever heard it ring.

I 

remember standing in the shade 
of an olive tree in Panathinaiko 
Stadium 
Square, 
sweat 

dripping down my face, trying to hail 
a cab. Classes had just gotten out for 
the day, and I was making my way 
to my cousin Zoe’s apartment. I was 
studying abroad at The Athens Centre 
in Athens, Greece, the summer after 
my freshman year at the University 
of Michigan. At this time, I felt left at 
odds about what I wanted to do, not 
only with my undergraduate career, 
but also in the years to come — the 
classic clueless freshman story.

I was going through a turbulent 

period, 
a 
dark 
hour 
caused 
by 

numerous things including the loss of 
people and things dear to my identity, 
partnered with other stress factors 
and a stress fracture (which helped 
to put an end to my running career). 
All these were magnified by my 
immersion in a familiarly unfamiliar 
city. I sought comfort in doing safe 
and routine things.

Every day after class was the same: 

walk to the stadium and try my hand 
at hailing a cab. However, what 
happened next was far from ordinary, 
and, oddly enough, helped push me to 
the next phase of my life.

Every day I’d encounter a different 

cab driver, and more often than not 
they’d tell me their story. I soon 
discovered that the economic crisis 
in Greece had cost many people their 
careers, and everyone from academics 
to lawyers had turned to jobs like cab 
driving to earn a living.

My curiosity in politics grew with 

each conversation, and I watched the 
news with great disappointment: The 
journalists had nothing on the cab 
drivers. These cab drivers gave me 
an insight of the city I couldn’t get 
anywhere else. I found their stories 
to be so fascinating that I’d relay 
them to anyone. One day, over Indian 
takeout, Zoe, who would often listen 
to me ramble, mentioned in passing 
that I really should write these down. 
I shrugged.
L

ater that night, I took out my 
journal that had remained 
relatively 
untouched 
since 

being gifted to me a year earlier. I 
always had an affinity for writing 
and my love for it started back in 
high school. For me, writing can 
bring forward the weakest and most 
sensitive parts of the soul, and in doing 
so one has to face unpleasant truths. 
That’s the power of words. They can fit 
together like perfect puzzle pieces to 

form streams of thought that have the 
potential to be insanely beautiful or 
break your heart. That past year there 
were too many changes, too many 
things on my mind that I was afraid to 
face, and I had been avoiding the one 
thing that I knew was going to help me.

These threads came together when 

I forced myself to sit down and write. 
However, nothing came out. I thought 
that writing about the cab driver 
wearing an all-white tux that proposed 
to me that day was whimsical and 
harmless, but I couldn’t find the first 
word to put down. “Writer’s block.” My 
frustration grew, but I finally found a 
good place to start.

“Maybe if I just start writing I’ll end 

up where I’m supposed to be.”

I scribbled this line underneath 

the date. That line led to an overflow 
of everything — pages of writing that 
seemed to go on endlessly.

Once I started I couldn’t stop — I still 

can’t. That wasn’t my first journal, but 
that time, it felt different. It became 
therapeutic. Prior to that, running had 
been my main source of meditation, 
but at that point, I was injured. That 
summer I found that I’ll always have 
my journal and my pen which is enough 
to make all the difference, even when 
I’m at my lowest.

I started to play with different 

styles, different ways of telling stories, 
and found poetry to be my favorite way 
to express intense emotions and prose 
to accompany dilemmas and streams of 
consciousness.

As a young writer, I am extremely 

subject to the influence of authors 
I read and the editors I have. I was 
truly fortunate to have a language and 
literature teacher back in high school 
that really seemed to believe in me. I 
was introduced to George Orwell and 
his works, specifically “Politics and 
the English Language” (basically his 
guide to writing), and others, which I 
fell in love with (read: my title).
S

omething that I have always 
taken very seriously is honesty 
— honesty in interpersonal 

relationships, and honesty in writing. 
The latter is the only way to get down 
to the root of an issue and confront it 
head-on. It’s also the best way for the 
truth to be expressed.

My sophomore year I joined The 

Michigan Daily’s news and sports 
staffs. 
I 
was 
compelled 
by 
my 

reawakened passion for writing and my 
love of honest storytelling. It was still 
helping me heal, and felt productive. I 
am a very private person, and for me, 
writing pieces that are about anyone 
but me felt good. Reporting stories 
and including any relevant fact in 
an objective way took time and is a 
constantly developing skill. These 
experiences transcend the newspaper 
and carry over into my personal craft, 
helping me write and edit myself better 
every time I pull out my journal.

I view my writing — whether it’s 

personal or professional — as marking 
monuments in my life. I feel things 
more completely when I write them 
down. My mind clears up and my logic 
surfaces. These landmarks show me 
when I was able to look myself in the 
mirror and identify the stranger and 
the enemy that we can often turn into. 
It keeps me sane.

This was about three years ago. 

Since then my pen has seen it all — 
anxiety, loss, anger — just as much as 
happiness, success and my dreams. 
Now, facing graduation in about a 
month, I am again at a crossroad in my 
life, this time there are no cab drivers 
to help me get to where I need to be, 
but my instinct and experiences to 
follow.

Why I write 

BY ANNA HARITOS, MANAGING SOCIAL EDITOR

ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY KOFFSKY


S

o I’m not sure if all three of my 
readers are aware, but I’m kind 
of into music a little bit.

I grew up listening to “The Free-

wheelin’ Bob Dylan” in my living room 
while building cities out of alphabet 
blocks, Legos and a Thomas the Tank 
Engine wooden train track set. I like 
to ask people, “What was the first song 
you remember hearing in your entire 
life that wasn’t a children’s song?” cause 
you learn a lot about someone by what 
was played in their house growing up. 
The most popular answers I’ve gotten 
have been The Beatles and Motown 
(mine was “I Feel the Earth Move” by 
Carole King).

Now, in my sophomore year of col-

lege, I have consistently surrounded 
myself with new releases, tried and true 
favorites at almost every waking hour 
of the day. As I write this column, Ken-
drick Lamar’s masterpiece To Pimp a 
Butterfly is on rotation on my turntable. 
The album artwork is lying on top of my 
red fire truck milk crate containing my 
favorite selections from my dad’s vinyl 
collection he left for me when he moved 
out and albums I have dug out of bins at 
record stores.

However, we live in a digital world 

and I can’t bring the crate everywhere I 
go. To make up for this, I never leave the 
house without headphones.

“Put Your Records On” — Corinne 

Bailey Rae

If there’s anything I’ve put an exor-

bitant amount of time into, it’s Spotify 
playlists. I spend so much time combin-
ing Spotify playlists, asking for recom-
mendations from friends and waiting for 
new albums to come out (if you haven’t, 
please listen to The Decemberists’ new 
album and talk to me about it).

One of the most important moments 

of my day is when I leave my dorm, 
arrive in the lobby of South Quad 
Residence Hall, dig into my pockets, 
unwrap my inevitably tangled head-
phones, plug in, hit “shuffle” on my 
monthly playlist and step outside. That 
first shuffle pulls the trigger on my 
racing pistol and sets me off for the 
daily grind.

Last week, as I headed downstairs 

— ready to enter the world — I reached 
into my left pocket, the designated con-
tainer for my precious headphones. My 
hand wriggled around in my loose over-
alls pockets but I didn’t feel the worn 
white plastic of the cable.

Oh no.

“Empty” — Kevin Abstract
I stood in the lobby in disbelief. I was 

already late by Michigan Time’s standards 
(R.I.P.) and most definitely did not have 
time to run up to the fifth floor of South 
Quad to dig around in my drawer and find 
my headphones. I knew exactly where 
they were — lying motionless, balled up in 
the left pocket of the red pants I wore the 
day before. If only they knew how much I 
depended on them to function.

They were probably lonely, resting in 

a busted modular furniture drawer, pur-
poseless. No electricity running through. 
They were cold and just wanted to be 
used to bring joy or sadness or anything 
in between — depending on the song.

I was frozen in place. People bumped 

into me as they left the lobby, embarking 
on their respective journeys while I had 
the equivalent of cinderblocks strapped to 
my feet. If I couldn’t soundtrack my walk 
to class, what was the purpose of going?

“If I Ain’t Got You” — Alicia Keys
I knew the playlist the moment I got up 

that morning.

I was a little groggy because I was up late 

reading and even my shower and breakfast 
couldn’t get me out of that sleepy haze. I 
knew it had to have a good beat or an amaz-
ing, belting chorus. In the wise words of that 
Old El Paso tortilla commercial, everyone 
seems to know, “Why don’t we have both?”

I could not get Alicia Keys out of my head. 

It was driving me insane. But no headphones 
meant Alicia would have to wait. I tried play-
ing it from my phone’s speakers and pretend-
ing I was on the phone but I couldn’t hear the 
horn section well enough — a crucial part of 
the instrumentation of “If I Ain’t Got You.”

It was useless. I was going to have to face 

that cold, arduous world alone. No music to 
accompany my strides. I mustered up the 
appropriate amount of courage for the situa-
tion, pulled my hat over my ears and pushed 
through the lobby’s main doors. Maybe the 
walk wouldn’t be too bad after all.

“Everything 
is 
Awful” 
— 
The 

Decemberists

I was so incredibly wrong. The sounds 

of the outside world were nothing com-
pared to my typical musical style. Cars 
honked at pedestrians, blue buses sped by, 
almost splashing walkers with rainwater 
pooling in the gutters and there was nei-
ther rhyme nor reason to the walk.

I heard so many conversations that 

were not meant for my ears. I am a very 
large fan of eavesdropping, some things 
are best left unheard. Here’s an example:

“Sometimes I eat strawberries whole, 

including the leaves, so I can get my daily 

serving of fruits and vegetables at the 
same time.”

Let’s be real. I didn’t need to know this 

fact about someone, and though they gave 
me content for this column, it was not what 
I would have preferred hearing on my way 
to class. That’s just a fact of life.

I was left without a purpose. I couldn’t 

match my pace to the beat or nod my head. 
I couldn’t pretend to play air piano to make 
people think I was like every other virtu-
oso at the University of Michigan. I was a 
fish out of water.

“Naked” — Ella Mai
I felt bare without those white earbuds 

leading a trail to my phone in my pocket. 
Wishing I had turned around when I had 
the chance, the sensory overload of vehi-
cles and odd fruit-based preferences was 
a lot to handle when I was already a little 
dazed from my morning.

Moving past my “Bob Dylan in the liv-

ing room” days, I had always found a way 
to bring music wherever I went. Being an 
only child means a lot of things, but one 
trait is pretty consistent among all single 
children I have ever talked to about the 
subject — it’s lonely as hell.

On long car rides to Kalamazoo, where 

almost all of my extended family lived at one 
point, I would sit in the backseat, straining 
my eyes trying to read everything I could 
see as the sun began to set. When it became 
no use and my parents wouldn’t let me turn 
the inside car overhead light on because it 
“distracted other drivers,” I would pull my 
yellow Sony Sport Discman out of my back-
pack. I’m pretty sure it was my dad’s before 
I adopted it. Flipping through my binder of 
CDs, I somehow always went back to my 
“I Love the ’80s” CD. Popping in the CD 
and placing those cheap foam headphones 

over my ears, I’d press play and track one, 
“I Love Rock ’n’ Roll” by Joan Jett and the 
Blackhearts, would weave its way to my 
eardrum and practically force me to tap my 
feet, singing the wrong words (I thought 
she said “juice box” instead of “jukebox” for 
a very long time).

But on my walk, I noticed a lull in cars 

and people walking to class. That’s when I 
heard the beauty of the walk without head-
phones: birds chirping, the Burton Tower 
in the distance, the crunch of snow still 
waiting to melt.

“I Like The Way This Is Going” — Eels
At that moment, I was cast back to my 

Alternative Spring Break trip to Harlan, 
Ky., a few weeks ago. I would wake up early 
in the morning, the sun just rising, and I 
would stand on the porch, listening to the 
sound of the breeze rustling the dense for-
ests ahead and the river running behind 
our compound. After realizing how long I 
had been drifting off into space, I rushed 
to the separate bathroom building, imme-
diately started a playlist on my speaker and 
hopped in the shower.

I cherished those brief moments of bliss 

in Kentucky, looking at the cows next door 
and imagining a world where I could live in 
that exact space and time for years on end. 
Why couldn’t I do the same in Ann Arbor?

I’ll be the first to admit I heavily depend 

on music to survive the weeks at school. It’s 
a release of stress, a culmination of emo-
tions and a method of expression unlike 
any other. However, stopping and listening 
to the tiny soundbites we often block out 
unconsciously creates a soundtrack of its 
own — one more authentic and without 
order, reason or control.

Maybe I’ll forget my headphones 

more often.

I spent the majority of last 
week in Wichita, Kansas, 

covering the Michigan Men’s 

Basketball team’s first and 
second round games of the 

NCAA tournament. In addition 

to the two thrilling games, I 

had close access to the players 

before and after the games 

during media availability in the 
locker room. Seeing the players 
just have fun and fool around 
off the court was one of my 

favorite parts of the trip, aside 

from the last three seconds 
of Saturday’s game against 

Houston.
