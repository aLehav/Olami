Abdul El-Sayed, Democratic 
runner-up 
in 
the 
Michigan 
gubernatorial 
primary 
last 
month, announced Monday the 
launch of his new political action 
committee, Southpaw Michigan.
Southpaw 
Michigan 
PAC 
aims to continue the progressive 
movement ignited by El-Sayed’s 
campaign 
for 
governor 
and 
seeks to promote progressive 
candidates in local Michigan 
races. On its website, Southpaw 
pledges support to six main 
issues: 
ethical 
campaign 
financing, universal health care, 
environmental justice, full civil 
rights and liberties, criminal 

justice reform, and equity in 
education. Southpaw Executive 
Director Aarica Marsh, a 2016 
graduate 
of 
the 
University 
of Michigan, said Southpaw 
intends to spread the enthusiasm 
produced 
during 
El-Sayed’s 
gubernatorial run to down-ballot 
races across the state.
“I think Abdul just wanted to 
make sure we did something with 
the momentum and volunteer 
base we built on the campaign,” 
Marsh said. “We had thousands 
of people making calls, texting, 
knocking doors … We want to 
make sure we’re electing local 
progressives, just because politics 
really starts at the local level.” 

The 
United 
States 
detains more citizens in 
prison than in any other 
country in the world, as 
well as more people under 
correctional control than 
any 
given 
moment 
in 
American history.
At 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, a team of five 
professors — Heather Ann 
Thompson, Matt Lassiter, 
Ruby Tapia, Ashley Lucas 
and Amanda Alexander — 
are working together to 
combat mass incarceration 
within academia.
Thompson, 
a 
Pulitzer 
Prize 
winner 
and 
professor of History and 
Afroamerican and African 
Studies, recently proposed 
the creation of an center 
devoted 
to 
researching 
the carceral state. Besides 
centralizing the academic 
study of prisons across 
units 
and 
schools, 
the 
professors 
also 
aim 
to 
make the research benefit 
individuals serving time, 
and potentially help them 
obtain 
an 
associate’s 
degree from the University.
“This center will be a 
focal point for the study 
of 
the 
carceral 
study,” 
Thompson said. “There are 
people interested in this 
subject in LSA, in the law 
school, in social work, and 

even in the medical school. 
Michigan has an usually 
rich environment in terms 
of the scholars that are 
working on this question.”
The 
University 
isn’t 
the 
first 
institution 
to 
attempt such a project — a 
number of elite colleges 
run successful initiatives 
disseminating educational 
opportunities 
to 
incarcerated 
individuals, 

including 
Bard 
College, 
University of California, 
Los Angeles, and Harvard 
University. 
Bard, 
for 
example, has granted over 
50,000 credits and almost 
450 degrees since its pilot 
programs in 2001.
Thompson 
said 
the 
degree-granting 
program 
would 
help 
bring 
the 
University to the level of 
those 
other 
institutions 

and beyond. She hopes 
to engage not only the 
campus 
community, 
but 
the 
greater 
Washtenaw 
County area and even the 
state of Michigan.
“Michigan is adjacent to 
a number of cities — Flint, 
Jackson 
and 
of 
course 
Detroit — that are hyper-
incarcerated,” 
Thompson 
said. “So, we feel as if there 

An 
increasing 
percentage 
of 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students are concerned about 
climate change, according to 
preliminary data from the 2017-
2018 
Sustainability 
Cultural 
Indicators Program survey. 
The SCIP survey has been sent 
out to thousands of students, staff 
and faculty annually since 2012, 
though no data was collected 
between 2015 to 2017.
The latest data suggests the 
percentage of students who are 
“extremely sure” climate change 
is occurring rose to about 75 
percent this past year, up almost 
10 percent from 2015. The 
percentage of students who think 
climate change is very important 
to them personally and those 
who think it is caused mostly by 
human activity also saw roughly 
10-point increases from the last 
SCIP survey.
The 
figures 
also 
show 
University students are more 
likely to believe in climate change 
than 
other 
students 
across 
the country. Yale University

Study comparing public universities scores Michigan fifth lowest state in the country

In a report on racial equity 

at public universities released 
Tuesday 
by 
the 
University 
of Southern California, the 
University of Michigan received 
an F grade in representation of 
Black students on campus.

While 17 percent of 18 to 
24-year-olds in the state of 
Michigan

Black, 
Black 
students constitute only 4.4

When

see a swarm of what looks 
like bats flying in the fall sky. 
However, these are chimney 
swifts, 
a 
protected 
bird 
species under the federal 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
that live in the old chimney 
at 415 W. Washington St.
The

in 
Ann

Black enrollment at the 
University is less than half 
the national average of 9.8 
percent. The study includes 
data on every four-year, 
non-specialized, 
public 
postsecondary institution 
in the nation, and F grades 
represent 
the 
bottom 
quintile of equity scores.
The 
University’s 
Ann 
Arbor campus received an 
overall score of 2.5 out of 
4, which was the highest of 
any university or college in 
the state. Across all states, 

however, Michigan had the 
fifth lowest equity index in 
the nation.
The 
“50-state 
report 
card” 
measured 
racial 
equity for Black students 
across 
all 
public 
universities 
in 
the 
United States using four 
indicators: the difference 
between the Black student 
population 
and 
the 
proportion of college-age 
Black people in the state, 
the gender makeup of Black 
students versus the gender 
makeup 
of 
the 
student 
body as a whole, the 6-year 
graduation rates for Black 
students versus those for 
all students and the ratio 

of Black students to Black 
professors.
Despite recent measures 
dedicated 
to 
lowering 
economic 
barriers 
of 
attendance including the 
Go Blue Guarantee, HAIL 
Scholarsand 
Wolverine 
Pathways, Black student 
enrollment at the University 
has hovered near 4 percent 
in the last half decade. Last 
year’s enrollment report 
showed the class of 2022 
slightly decreased in Black 
representation. 
In gender equity, the 
University 
received 
an A grade. The Black 
student population at the 
University is 58.8 percent 
women and 41.2 percent 
men, while nationally 
the percentages are 52 
and 48, respectively.
In a 2016 interview, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
said 
he did not foresee any 
immediate 
large-scale 
changes in racial and 
socioeconomic diversity 
due 
to 
the 
recent 
program rollouts.
“There won’t be as 
big a leap this year as 
there was last year,” he 
said after the release 
of the 2016 enrollment 
report. “It’s the kind of 
thing that will continue 
to bounce up and down 
year by year, but it’s 
important the overall 
trajectory is upward.”
The University also 
received an A grade 
in the ratio of Black 
students 
to 
Black 
faculty, which was 7 
to 1. However, Black 
faculty are still more 
underrepresented 
than 
Black 
students, 

constituting 
only 
2.6 
percent of the University’s 
7,022 full-time faculty.
Under-enrollment 
has 
been 
a 
long-standing 
point of contention for the 
Black campus community. 
Campus groups like the 
Black 
Student 
Union 
have 
proposed 
various 
steps for the University 
to 
take 
toward 
racial 
equity 
since 
the 
Black 
Action Movements of the 
1970s. Historic measures 
include 
increasing 
housing affordability and 
admissions policies similar 
to the state of Texas’s “top 
10 percent rule,” which 
guarantees admission to 
all state universities for 
students 
who 
graduate 
in the top 10 percent of 
their high school class. 
After a statewide ban on 
affirmative action in 2006, 
minority enrollment at the 
University has failed to 
rebound.
History 
professor 
Matthew 
Countryman 
estimated that the ban 
on 
affirmative 
action 
discluded 
approximately 
860 
African 
Americans, 
133 Latino/as and 56 Native 
Americans from admission 
to the University in the 
years 2007 to 2016.
The 
USC 
study 
does 
not include measures of 
campus 
climate, 
but 
a 
sample University survey 
reported 
Black 
and 
Hispanic 
students 
are 
more likely to experience 
discrimination on campus 
at rates 519 and 132 percent 
higher than white students, 
respectively.

the council to preserve the 
chimney as a free-standing 
structure for the protected 
species.

Cathy 
Theisen, 
conservation chair at the 
Washtenaw 
Audubon 
Society, explained chimney 
swifts roost during the fall 
and spring to keep warm 
before migrating back to 
South America. Chimney 
swifts used to roost in trees 
until they were cut down.
“They 
usually 
would 
have roosted in old grove 
trees that were hollowed 
out 
once 
they 
died,” 
Theisen said. “But, in the 
early 1900s, all the old 
grove trees were taken 
… there are so few trees 
left for them that they 
adapted to living in urban 
environments.”
As 
of 
August, 
the 
Washtenaw 
Audubon 
Society 
had 
recorded 
1,400 birds roosting in the 
chimney. Theisen said the 
birds provide an ecological 
advantage for the area 
because they eat one-third 
of their weight daily in 
insects such as mosquitoes, 
termites and wasps.
Kathy 
Griswold, 
who 
won the Ward 2 Democratic 
primary for City Council 
and is now uncontested in 
the 
general 
election, 
is 
concerned 
with council 
decisions 
becoming 
more based in 
emotion than 
facts.
“One 
of 
my concerns 
is 
are 
we 
going to have 
a 
formal 
decision-
making 
process 
to 
decide 
what 
to do with the 
building?” 
Griswold said. 
“Frequently 
we get input 
from 
the 
community 
but it’s more 
just (a lot of 
emotion) gets 
interjected 
and we don’t 
have 
the 
facts 
and 
a 
framework 
to make the 
decision.”
Theisen 
says 
the 
council 
has 
been 
very 
responsive to 
Washtenaw 
Audubon 
Society 
in 
finding 
a 
conservation 
solution.
“My belief is that the 
city wants to cooperate,” 
Theisen said. “Obviously, 
they’re going to have to 
(decide) what the citizens 
want. That is why it is 
so crucial that any Ann 
Arbor voter who wants 
to preserve this chimney 
contact Council.”
Councilmember 
Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1, said 
she and Mayor Christopher 
Taylor drafted a proposal 
for presentation at the City 
Council’s Oct. 1 meeting, 
which she assured puts 
the needs of the chimney 
swifts before development 
of the property.
Theisen said the beauty 
of 
the 
chimney 
swifts 
resonates with residents.
“I heard one woman tell 
me that on 9/11 after she 
watched the buildings go 
down that the only thing 
she could think to do was 
go out and look at the 

(chimney swifts) just to 
see something natural is 
instead of what was going 
on in the world,” Theisen 
said.
City 
officials 
are 
considering redevelopment 
of the dilapidated city-
owned 
building. 
City 
Administrator 
Howard 
Lazarus said the city is 
still 
exploring 
options 
regarding the development 
of the property.
“There are no definitive 
plans right now. The City’s 
intent is to explore options 
concerning the chimney 
and the swifts as part of the 
redevelopment 
process,” 
Lazarus wrote.
Griswold 
believes 
the chimney should be 
preserved and the rest of 
the building torn down.
“That building I think 
is an eyesore and is unsafe 
and it really needs to come 
down independent of the 
chimney, 
especially 
the 
part that comes close to 
the road,” Griswold said. 
“I just don’t see where the 
city would allow a private 
company to have that kind 
of a building standing the 
way it is.”
While 
no 
distinct 
plans are scheduled, the 
city has been previously 
approached 
by 
multiple 
realtors, 
according 
to 
MLive. One realtor, Bud 
Falsetta with Real Estate 
One, proposed a senior 
living facility 
owned 
by 
Morningstar 
Senior 
Living based 
in 
Denver. 
Conducted 
assessments 
have 
shown 
it 
is 
not 
worthwhile 
to rehabilitate 
the buildings 
due 
to 
costs 
and 
structural 
concerns.
Griswold 
said she hasn’t 
seen 
any 
reports from 
the city staff, 
saying 
city 
government 
operates 
on 
political 
motives 
rather 
than 
data.
“The 
culture 
of 
City Council 
and 
city 
staff for the 
last 
couple 
of 
decades 
just 
hasn’t 
really 
been 
data driven.” 
Griswold 
said. “They’ve 
been 
more 
politically 
driven.”
City 
records 
also 
allude 
to 
pollution 
concerns 
of 
contaminated soil under 
the 
property. 
According 
to 
Historic 
District 
Application Records, the 
property’s building code 
cannot be changed due to 
the flood elevations of the 
site. A DRN Architects 
reportconcluded 
the 
building is not a good 
candidate for rehabilitation 
or reuse.
The Washtenaw Audubon 
Society 
has 
currently 
raised 
approximately 
$5,000 to donate toward 
preservation 
efforts. 
In its letter written to 
the council, the society 
said they hope to see the 
chimney serve as a natural 
history site.
“This 
is 
a 
way 
we 
can 
really 
change 
our 
environment with a very 
small bit of action,” Theisen 
said.

is a community component 
needed. 
(The 
center) 
could really be a resource 
for people in our general 
community, whether it be 
with re-entry into society 
or for potential students 
getting 
into 
college. 
Essentially, 
we 
want 
to 
bring Michigan up to speed 
where a lot of institutions 
already are.”
The center would also 
connect the already existing 
programs at the University, 
such as the Prison Creative 
Arts Project and Inside-
Out 
Prison 
Exchange 
Program, to work together 
and further enhance the 
relationship between the 
University community and

for joint projects between 
students and incarcerated 
individuals to communicate 
and creatively write, draw 
and perform. Each week, 
about 80 volunteers enter 
facilities and meet with 
those inside. At the end 
of 
the 
semester, 
PCAP 
publishes both exhibitions 
of art and a journal of 
writing by the Michigan 
prisoners they have worked 
with all year.
LSA junior Liv Naimi, 

a PCAP executive board 
member, is excited about the 
prospect of a new carceral 
studies program. 
“(PCAP) allows students 
to see that people inside 
are 
not 
only 
creative 
but 
productive 
and 
amazing people — it really 
humanizes them,” Naimi 
said. “Some of them will be 
in there forever, and some 
of them won’t. Sometimes, 
something 
as 
little 
as 
playing an improv game, 
where people just simply 
get to laugh, feels like a 
transformative moment.”
PCAP 
Director 
Ashley 
Lucas, a Theatre & Drama 
associate professor, believes 
education 
inside 
doesn’t 
just 
benefit 
incarcerated 
individuals, but society as 
whole by means of public 
safety.
“Education 
and 
family 
support are the two things 
that really help people to be 
successful after they come 
home from prison,” Lucas 
said. “The vast majority of 
the people we’ve locked up 
are coming home someday. 
Do we want them to come 
home uneducated, angry, 
having 
lived 
in 
social 
environment 
that 
didn’t 
prepare them for the outside 
world? Do we want them to 
have a lack of connections 
to 
communities 
outside? 
Education helps to fix all of 
those issues.”
Moreover, 
Lucas 
said 
many 
of 
those 
behind 
bars 
were 
not 
afforded 
opportunities 
to 
receive 

a good education in the 
first place — or perhaps 
an education at all. These 
programs intend to give 
prisoners the chance to have 
that 
quality 
educational 
experience, 
which 
Lucas 
hopes 
will 
help 
them 
succeed when they reenter 
everyday society.
“If you don’t give people 
educational opportunities, 
they may never know what 
they’re 
really 
good 
at,” 
Lucas said. “They may have 
come from a place with little 
stability and crime was the 
only viable option, or it may 
feel that way if you’re in a 
certain set of circumstances 
and you don’t realize you 
have other choices. There 
is nobody who really knows 
what their life and career 
is truly going to offer, but 
education helps us think 
those things through and 
plan for a better life. It 
helps us build relationships 
and relate to other people 
in a lot of ways you really 
can’t function in the outside 
world without: It teaches 
you a completely different 
social code.”
Both 
Lucas 
and 
Thompson emphasize the 
barriers many with criminal 
records face in securing 
employment, housing and 
higher education. Earlier 
this 
month, 
Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder signed a bill into law 
banning felon boxes from 
state job applications, but 
private employers and even 
the University itself still 
require self-reporting on 

applications. 
Students applying to the 
University have to check a 
box whether or not they have 
served time. To Thompson, 
this act is unjust, and she 
hopes the new center will 
mitigate the harmful after-
effects of incarceration.
“We want to make sure 
we 
open 
our 
doors 
to 
people who, if they are 
qualified to be here, their 
criminal 
history 
should 
be irrelevant,” Thompson 
said. “We have invested 
unprecedented 
public 
resources in the project of 
punishment in the last four 
years, which has enormous 
ripple effects: it has impacts 
on our U-M school system, 
it 
has 
impacts 
on 
our 
economy, and it has impacts 
on our voting and on our 
democracy. Institutions of 
learning are places where 
we ask questions.”
Thompson said she aims 
for the new center will allow 
the University to become a 
leader and change-maker in 
the field of carceral studies.
“Whether 
you’re 
a 
political scientist interested 
in 
voting 
participation 
or 
whether 
you’re 
a 
sociologist 
interested 
in 
family structure or whether 
you’re a doctor interested in 
health outcomes — you can’t 
ask any of those questions 
without noting the impact 
of this massive carceral 
state,” she said. “Michigan 
is a public institution. It is 
time we take the lead on 
this.”

INCARCERATED

survey that shows just over 
45 percent of college students 
nationally were “extremely sure” 
climate change is real — nearly 30 
percent lower than the University 
of Michigan figures.
Bob 
Marans, 
a 
professor 
emeritus and researcher at the 
Institute for Social Research, 
serves as one of the principal 
investigators on the SCIP survey. 
Marans said events including 
forest fires in California and 
volcanic eruptions in Hawaii — as 
well as the increasing attention 
climate change receives on the 
political stage — have made 
climate change a more visible 
issue. He sees the latest data as 
an indicator that students are 
becoming more aware of current 
events.
“Given what’s going on now 
with the hurricane that’s coming 
in, (in) North Carolina and South 
Carolina, a lot more of these kinds 
of events are happening and … 
people are probably reacting to 
what the United States did in 
terms of pulling out of the Paris 
Climate Accord,” Marans said. “I 
think those are some of the factors 
that are influencing a greater 
concern and awareness about it.”
The results of the latest survey 
didn’t surprise LSA senior Tim 
Arvan, but they did impress 
him. Arvan is the co-director of 
Climate Blue, a climate change 
action group on campus that sends 
a delegation every year to a United 

Nations conference on climate 
change. Arvan said he’s seen 
more awareness of climate issues 
among his classmates recently.
“It’s really encouraging to see 
this data and to see the leadership 
that U of M has, especially relative 
to the national average on climate 
change awareness,” Arvan said. “I 
think this is due to both the quality 
of instruction that’s offered at 
this university, but also due to 
the activism efforts and personal 
enthusiasm 
for 
these 
issues, 
and the passion to get involved 
both politically and scientifically 
within the student body itself.”
Earth 
and 
Environmental 
Studies professor Julia Cole has 
led classes on climate change 
to undergraduate and graduate 
students at the University since 
last year and does not skirt around 
the issue in class.
“I consistently teach it as if 
it is scientific fact that we are 
changing climate and that it’s bad 
and it’s about to get worse because 
that is my belief based on working 
in this area for a long time,” Cole 
said. “There really is no way 
around that.”
Cole said none of the students 
she’s had at the University yet have 
pushed back on her approach. Like 
Arvan and Marans, she thinks 
the latest SCIP data makes sense 
based on what she’s seen.
“I don’t think it’s surprising,” 
she said. “That said though, 
as a scientist I’d love to think 
that people make those kinds 
of statements based on (their) 
knowledge 
of 
science, 
but 
actually, the thing I’ve learned 

about communication is that they 
don’t, and that they tend to be 
persuaded by what their peers are 
talking about.”
Nonetheless, Cole said it doesn’t 
matter so much how people are 
concluding climate change is 
important — she’s just happy to 
hear they think it’s important at 
all.
“I think traditionally climate 
change has been one of those 
things that is considered to be 
extremely important in the next 
20 years, but not necessarily 
extremely important in the next 
year,” she said. “But people vote 
and make decisions on their 
short-term worries and so if we 
keep thinking of it as a long-term 
future problem, we’re never going 
to solve it.”
Whether students are treating 
climate change as an immediate 
problem is not quite clear from 
the data, though. While he’s 
enthusiastic about the latest SCIP 
results, Arvan said part of him 
worries there isn’t enough being 
done on campus to spur action.
“I don’t speak for anyone other 
than myself when I say that,” 
Arvan said. “But I think a lot of the 
work that is done on campus gets 
people to feel really good about 
climate change issues and problem 
solving and that the process 
can be a bit of greenwashing 
where people feel that they are 
contributing enough by using a 
water bottle or by implementing 
some very, maybe entry level or 
simplistic lifestyle changes that 
really simplify the problem down 
without really diving deeper and 

understanding the complexities 
and further channels to get 
involved.”
This 
topic 
gained 
some 
attention at the University’s 
Board of Regent’s September 
meeting. 
Several 
public 
commenters, 
including 
LSA 
sophomore Catherine Garton, a 
co-founder of the U-M Climate 
Action 
Movement, 
detailed 
concerns that the University was 
not devoting enough attention to 
mitigation climate change.
“The University is trying, but 
it is not trying hard enough,” 
Garton said. “I feel that we have 
fallen behind in this regard. 
Climate change is the biggest 
problem facing my generation.”
Arvan said he isn’t sure 
exactly how the University can 
translate 
students’ 
concerns 
into action. He said that’s “the 
million-dollar question.” But he 
does believe the latest SCIP data 
shows the school is moving in 
the right direction.
“Understanding that policy 
is really the focal point of 
effectuating change and getting 
people … politically inclined to 
express themselves on these 
issues is a is a way to really 
drive home local change,” he 
said. “But then also I think that 
personal lifestyle changes are 
really important component of 
getting people to appreciate how 
their individual impacts can add 
up to be really significant … it’s 
an ongoing challenge of all the 
student organizations involved 
in this field to kind of figure out 
how to progress on that front.”

W

ith 
the 
midterms 
coming 
up, 
Republicans 
have 
an important question to ask 
themselves: 
Am 
I 
ok 
with 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
becoming 
the 
next 
Ronald 
Reagan? Reagan reshaped the 
Republican 
Party’s 
policies, 
strategies 
and 
style 
for 
generations to come. Trump is on 
course to do the same. This should 
be a scary thought for everyone, 
especially Republicans.
 Trump enjoys a 93 percent 
approval rating among voters who 
identify as strongly Republican. 
Yet many of Trump’s strongest 
critics in the Republican Party 
have left office, including 40 
Republicans in Congress. The 
Republican 
primaries 
have 
been a success for Trump, 
with 35 of the 37 Republicans 
Trump endorsed victorious in 
their respective elections. The 
Republican National Committee 
is run by a former Trump 
campaign chief and has been 
shaped in Trump’s image. Once 
the source of ideas and policy 
initiatives, the RNC, in pure 
Trump style, now has a website 
called LyinComey.com, which 
has the sole purpose to attack 
James Comey, former director 
of the FBI. Polls of Republicans 
show Trump is changing minds 
in the party base. Once settled 
issues in the court of Republican 
opinion, tariffs and Vladimir 
Putin’s role in the world are now 
becoming increasingly positively 
acceptedby 
Republicans. 
The 
hope that Trump would be shaped 
more by the establishment of the 
party than vice-versa is dead.
You might be thinking Trump 
should be considered a conservative 
president because he’s passed some 
conservative policies. But he’s too 
inconsistent. He passes tax cuts 
while embarking on a quixotic 
protectionist 
mission 
against 
China. 
He 
increases 
military 
spending while undermining the 
alliance system that has been the 
hallmark of U.S. security policy 
since the end of World War II. 
He supports Israel, but also anti-
Semites. 
Trump is inconsistent because 
he doesn’t have any normative or 
moral compass. His only guidance 
seems to come from considerations 
of power. The organizing principle 
of his trade policy is that we win 
and our trade partners lose. He has 
no problem attacking the media, 
institutions, individuals or even his 
own cabinet members if he thinks 
it makes him look good. For Trump, 
major decisions are a calculation of 
power rather than principle. He’s a 

drunk man’s Niccolò Machiavelli. 
Trump’s 
singular 
obsession 
with power is what makes him 
fundamentally different than past 
modern conservatives. Trump’s 
view of American exceptionalism is 
devoid of values.
Reagan’s brand of conservatism 
saw America as a beacon for 
freedom on the global stage and 
a city on a hill for anyone who 
sought freedom and opportunity. 
Domestically, the party under 
Reagan promoted smaller, more 
efficient government and a free 
market, which included free trade, 
as to avoid hindering individual 
ambition and innovation. But I’m 
not arguing the Republican Party 
or its values were perfect before 
Trump.
There’s a reason Republicans 
have long struggled to capture 
minority votes. Illiberal populism 
that deals in racism, sexism and 
homophobia has existed on the 

right to different degrees since 
the Civil Rights Act. But the 
Republican Party has had some 
grand moments. I can name a few: 
taking a decisive stance against the 
Soviet Union, granting amnesty 
to 
3 
million 
undocumented 
immigrants, rigorously upholding 
a liberal international order which 
promotes 
human 
rights 
and 
freedom and promoting free trade 
around the world.
Even if you strongly oppose 
these traditionally conservative 
values, it’s still beneficial for 
everyone that the Republican Party 
has values to which it can be held 
accountable. It’s important for 
political parties to run on values 
or ideas with policies that are as 
consistent as possible. When they 
don’t, elections tend to descend 
from a clash of ideas to a clash of 
tribal and cultural loyalties. Such 
a clash of tribal loyalties will only 
make our polarized political system 
more fragmented.
Today, the Republican Party is 
being reshaped. It’s being reshaped 
to care only that America is strong 
and that its enemies—which are 
an ever-growing list of countries, 
institutions 
and 
people—are 
weak. It’s a party that terrorizes 

migrant children by placing them 
in detention centers and tries to 
deport even those who have known 
no home but America. It’s a party 
that is cutting the number of legal 
immigrants because it believes 
people from certain backgrounds 
have less to contribute. It’s a party 
that doesn’t believe in free trade. 
And who cares if dictatorships 
and illiberal regimes spread across 
the world? They want strong 
friends, not morally upstanding 
ones. To Trump’s Republican 
Party, 
defending 
American 
exceptionalism means upholding 
sovereignty, borders and brute 
strength rather than upholding 
freedom, global prosperity and 
human 
rights. 
Trump’s 
view 
of America is unexceptional. It 
mirrors the way strongmen around 
the world view their countries.
The midterms are a referendum 
on Trump’s politics. A defeat of 
Trump’s candidates could awaken 
the establishment and the base 
of the party. Republicans should 
thus vote Democratic or not vote 
at all. The fact is that Trump’s 
politics are not a stable foundation 
to base the future of the party. 
Millennials will outnumber baby 
boomers by 2019, and Trump and 
his policies are very unpopular 
among millennials. Trump relies 
on nativist sentiment that speaks 
to a white-majority nation. Before 
2050, white Americans will not 
be a majority. Even now, despite 
Trump’s attack on immigrants 
and 
our 
immigration 
system, 
most Americans see immigration 
positively. Former State Secretary 
Hillary Clinton won the popular 
vote by 3 million while being a very 
unpopular candidate during the 
2016 election. What happens when 
the Democrats find a charismatic 
candidate again?
Many 
Republicans 
likely 
support Trump and his views 
because they think he’s better than 
any Democrat would be. But such 
dialectical thinking has limits. 
What does Trump have to do for 
that not to be true? Start a trade 
war that will cost consumers and 
could actually ruin Christmas? 
He’s already done that. If you’re 
a Republican reading this, the 
next time people are outraged at 
Trump, please think about what 
our president has actually done. 
Ask yourself, “Would I be okay 
with Obama or Bush doing this?” 
Only then can the Republican Party 
reshape itself again, taking the best 
of its previous foundations and 
better adapting to the 21st century.

Hey, I’m a fat person
S

ifting through the sales rack, I 
could hear her laughing closely 
behind me as she organized 
the clothing on hangers. When I asked 
for a dressing room, she looked at the 
yellow jumpsuit in my hand and gave 
me an awkward smile. Staring at myself 
in the mirror, I pulled the jumpsuit up 
my legs and over my butt, noticing a 
small hole. The jumpsuit was cute but 
a little too tight, so I decided to return 
it to the front counter. As I waited for 
my friends to finish changing, I spent 
some time looking at the jewelry. There, 
I overheard the saleswoman ask her 
manager, “What am I supposed to do 
with this big hole?” She looked at me and 
laughed again. I quickly looked down 
at the earrings, trying my best to ignore 
her. My friends finished paying and we 
continued shopping down State Street.
Later that day, laying on my bed, 
staring at the ceiling, I could not stop 
thinking about the interaction with 
this saleswoman. She made me feel 
like there was something wrong with 
me and brought back thoughts of 
insecurity I had been fighting for so 
long. I was angry she had the power 
to make me feel bad. But then it came 
to me: She’s just afraid. She is scared of 
being fat. It made me feel bad for her.
As someone who identifies as being 
a fat, curvy, tall person, I have been 
fighting my internalized fatphobia for 
as long as I can remember. I spent so 
much time trying to be smaller because 
believed if I was smaller, I would be 
happy and love myself. But the truth 
is no diet, workout plan or change in 
weight has ever made me happier than 
when I stopped fighting and started 
accepting myself. My mindset did not 
change all at once, but over time I have 
had a fundamental shift in the way 
I see my body and the other bodies 
around me.
Last year, my roommate showed me 
a YouTube channel called StyleLikeU 

in which a mother and daughter 
interviewed different models, artists and 
activists about their styles and accepting 
their bodies while they stripped down 
to their underwear. After watching so 
many of these videos, I was in awe of 
how vulnerable the participants were 
about sharing their stories and bodies. 
I started searching for more videos of 
activists like StyleLikeU hosts Iskra 
Lawrence and Barbie Ferreira and 
followed their Instagram accounts. 
They led me to a greater community 
of body-positive activists who were 
using media platforms to combat diet 
culture and fatphobia by uplifting each 
other with bodies that challenge the 
mainstream ideals of beauty.
With this whole new ideology 
in mind and the support of an online 
community, I began talking to my 
friends who look and feel the way I 
do about our experiences with our 
bodies, beauty and shopping. We 
share websites to buy clothes like 
Fashion Nova Curve and ASOS. We 
also support each other on difficult 
days when we still struggle to accept 
ourselves. Since the day with the 
saleswoman, my friends have been 
there reminding me why I am beautiful 
exactly the way I am. But even with all 
of this amazing support, I still live in a 
world where people are afraid of those 
who radically love themselves without 
trying to change their bodies. I still have 
to deal with doctors, family members 
and strangers who think they know 
more about my body than I do and are 
worried about my health in relation to 
my weight.
Last week, in my Bodies Studies 
psychology seminar, I shared the body-
positive community on Instagram with 
my class, hoping to help more people 
find supportive accounts to follow like 
one of my favorites, @bodyposipanda. 
However, a classmate interrupted me 
saying she thinks posts from activists 

like Tess Holliday are problematic 
because they perpetuate obesity and 
she is worried about their health. It was 
exactly what I had been preparing to 
respond to, but I found myself at a loss 
for words. I couldn’t stand up for myself 
and advocate for my identity because I 
felt targeted. But my badass graduate 
student instructor saved the day and 
shared some findings from an article 
she read mentioning one’s weight is 
not the only indicator of health, and we 
cannot make these assumptions about 
people’s bodies. I was lucky to have 
her support when I couldn’t fight for 
myself.
Now that there have been 
more plus size and curve models in 
mainstream campaigns for beauty 
and clothing lines, it may look like our 
society is comfortable with bigger-
bodied people; however, there is still 
a lot of progress to be made with 
representation. For example, the 
Netflix show “Insatiable” had a fat 
character, played by an actress in a fat 
suit, who lost weight by having her 
mouth wired shut, thus perpetuating 
fatphobia. We need to see fat people 
doing more than just dealing with 
the fact that they are fat. We need to 
see fat people living their lives and 
having complex storylines. Also, there 
is a movement in the body-positive 
community for more representation of 
fat men because most of the activists 
and accounts are run by women.
This has been the hardest column 
for me to write because bringing any 
attention to my body has always been 
negative. But I know by writing this, I 
am helping myself own my fat, curvy 
identity and creating a space for others 
to think and unpack the false narratives 
they have learned about fat people.

Republican strategy come November

Deborah Ramirez spoke out 
earlier this week with the help 
of a civil rights lawyer regarding 
her experience of sexual assault 
by Kavanaugh while they were 
classmates 
at 
Yale 
University. 
On Tuesday, a third woman who 
attended 
high 
school 
nearby 
Kavanaugh, accused the nominee of 
sexual misconduct during a string of 
high school parties.
The course of action before 
the Senate should have been 
clear: investigate these allegations 
seriously and thoroughly before 
elevating Kavanaugh for a lifetime 
appointment to the nation’s highest 
court. Yet Republicans in the majority 
have sought to disregard or discredit 
the seriousness of the matter. In 
response to hearing rumors of the 
second set of allegations, The New 
Yorker reported Senate Republicans 
chose to accelerate the confirmation 
process rather than slow down and 
allow Ramirez to tell her story. The 
Senate Judiciary Committee even 
chose to schedule Kavanaugh’s 
nomination for Friday, thereby 
assuming the testimony from Blasy-
Ford the day before will have no 
effect on continuing the nomination 
process. 
As college students, we are 
appalled. Senate Republicans, don’t 
tell the Ramirezs and Kavanaughs 
that walk among us today that 
there is a statute of limitations on 
one’s moral character. Yet, Senate 
Republicans have chosen in their 
actions to broadcast to the world 
— and us — allegations of sexual 
misconduct from a man’s past 
should have no serious bearing on 
his elevation to the nation’s highest 

court. What does that say to the high 
school students and college freshmen 
across the country? The rhetoric, 
from President Donald Trump in 
particular, exudes a rationale and 
sense of exception for both a young 
Kavanaugh and Supreme Court 
nominee Kavanaugh. But how can 
we disregard the actions of one from 
the other? 
The 
allegations 
against 
Kavanaugh bring into question the 
standards surrounding the morality 
and character we hold our officials 
to. Yet, it is no longer acceptable 
to only hold those in positions of 
power accountable. The consistent 
argument from Trump, Kavanaugh 
and 
other 
Republican 
officials 
hinging on the time lag between 
the public accusations and when 
the events actually occurred brings 
into question how we hold those our 
age, those around us, accountable for 
their actions.
On 
a 
campus 
confronting 
the same issues of sexual assault, 
survivor care and dangerous party 
culture, we need to hold our peers 
to a standard of character. The dorm 
party that becomes uncomfortable 
and crosses a line, someone taking 
advantage of another student at 
that Welcome Week house party 
and the inappropriate advances 
happening next you at a bar – these 
instances, not all that different from 
the experiences the three women 
underwent, happen all too often 
on our campus. Yes, a conversation 
and active change regarding how 
we evaluate the character of the 
men and women we put in office 
is vital. But, if the Kavanaugh 
accusations highlight anything, it is 

that there is no expiration date for 
the repercussions of our past actions. 
There should be no acceptance, 
regardless of age, position or 
situation when it comes to sexual 
assault.
Almost 30 years ago we had 
an opportunity to set a precedent 
for how we treat survivors. It was 
hailed as a watershed moment, 
but we ended up going backward. 
Democratic senators treated Anita 
Hill, Justice Clarence Thomas’s 
sexual assault accuser, with outright 
disdain and disrespect. The hearings 
and investigations into Kavanaugh’s 
conduct are an opportunity to set a 
new precedent of respect, to bring 
justice to the victims and to do 
right by Hill and all those neglected 
in the past. If Senate Republicans 
choose to continue the course of 
plowing ahead with Kavanaugh’s

Our eyes are on the Senate

T

his week, two new sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court 
nominee Brett Kavanaugh surfaced. As of Wednesday, three women 
have come forward with allegations against the potential candidate 
for one of the most important seats in our government. Last week, Christine 
Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, went public with a disturbing 
incident that occurred while her and Kavanaugh were at a high school party.

T

hough it’s been more than 
20 years since marijuana 
legalization 
became 
popular in the ballots, the Green 
Wolverine 
Science 
Symposium 
marks the first student-organized 
cannabis science conference in 
University of Michigan history. 
Among the seemingly endless 
opinions regarding approval and 
legalization of cannabis, there 
remains truth in scientific research, 
and this event intends to highlight 
the 
latest, 
groundbreaking 
advancements from some of the 
country’s leading cannabis experts. 
It will diplomatically challenge 
the student body’s knowledge of a 
stigmatized topic, and it will do so 
without telling us how to think.
The symposium was planned 
in anticipation of the vote on 
the 
Marijuana 
Legalization 
Initiative in Michigan’s Nov. 
6 
election. 
The 
proposal 
would allow adults 21 years 
old and older to possess and 
use cannabis under state law. 
Legalization of both medical 
and recreational marijuana has 
been eagerly rising as many 
states have already passed some 
form of legislation in support of 
the plant. It’s time for Michigan 
folks to decide if cannabis 
will be legal for recreational 
use in the mitten, and student 
organization Green Wolverine, 
the symposium’s host, wants to 
educate the Ann Arbor masses.

With the core purpose of 
informing students and rebuking 
prevalent 
misconceptions, 
the event is not meant to sway 
minds one way or another. 
Green Wolverine Founder Adam 
Rosenberg, a Business senior, 
says the symposium was put 
together solely to objectively 
educate 
and 
help 
facilitate 
informed decisions.
“We are not saying that 
people 
should 
or 
shouldn’t 
use 
cannabis,” 
Rosenberg 
explained. “We are going to 
present the information as it 
exists in current science and 
allow people to come to their 
own decisions based on that.”
Green 
Wolverine, 
a 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business 
club, 
focuses on the educational and 
networking opportunities within 
the 
legal, 
multibillion-dollar 
cannabusiness industry. Though 
laws surrounding the industry 
are currently ambiguous, legal 
businesses are rapidly populating 
the cannabis market. Rosenberg 
recognized 
marijuana 
as 
a 
business prospect is plagued by 
stigmatization, resulting in its 
exclusion from a standard business 
education. Rosenberg spotted the 
opportunity his sophomore year 
at the Ross School of Business and 
started Green Wolverine to take 
advantage of the industry’s rapid 
growth. The club does not take a 
political stance and, according to 

its mission, directs attention only 
to business opportunities that are 
entirely legal.
Now, we know there have been 
grand displays of student activism 
in the past: In March 1970, a four-
day environmental teach-in at 
the University raised awareness 
and harnessed the passion that 
resulted in the first Earth Day just 
one month later. In 1965, University 
of California, Berkeley students 
organized the largest Vietnam 
teach-in, publicizing the truth 
about the war and making it easier 
for students to learn what’s going 
on in the world around them. I 
recognize demonstrations about 
war are distinguishable from those 
about drugs — however, similar 
to these teach-ins, the Green 
Wolverine Science Symposium is 
anything but a protest, making it a 
unique demonstration. Rosenberg 
agreed.
“This 
is 
not 
a 
political 
statement, this isn’t trying to 
change anyone’s opinion,” he said 
regarding the symposium. Like 
its activism ancestors in their 
respective fields, the symposium 
is the first of its kind in the realm 
of cannabis.

Trump is 
inconsistent 
because he doesn’t 
have any moral 
compass


Apart 
from 
soberly 

functioning 
every 
day, 

introspecting into the quirks 
and the charms that we hold 
informs how we respond to 
the pressure campus culture 
puts on defining who we are. 
Our campus is filled with 
millennials, and it’s no wonder 
that one of our privileges 
over 
previous 
generations 

lies 
in 
the 
formation 
of 

self-identity. 
We’re 
caught 

between a wealth of human 
and internet resources and the 
impressionability of our years. 
The decisions we make about 
what campus spaces to belong 
to, and what to achieve for 
ourselves, eventually build into 
each other. They develop into 
another layer of our identity 
— like secondary, permeable 
skins. At their best, these skins 
filter out those earthly forces 
— relationship issues, mental 
illness, financial burdens — 
from 
deconstructing 
stable 

senses of self. Though the 
relative 
ease 
with 
which 

we define ourselves doesn’t 
enable an immediate facility in 
answering the age-old question 
of “Who am I?”, it does make it 
tempting for us to feel entitled 
to 
expressing 
that 
answer 

when we think we’ve found it.

Cultural organizations on 

campus 
particularly 
urge 

millennials 
with 
minority 

identities 
to 
express 
their 

ties to their own heritage. I 
think one reason why such 
organizations 
emphasize 

cultural expression is to assert 
that the connection between 
national and ethnic identities 
remains intact, despite the 
marginalizing 
attitudes 

to 
which 
minorities 
have 

historically been subjected. For 
instance, the Indian American 
Student Association’s annual 
cultural show connects the 
meaning 
of 
being 
Indian-

American 
with 
traditional 

Indian song and dance, for 
a 
more 
than 
enthusiastic 

audience. Thus, I understand 
that 
minorities’ 
resistance 

toward systems of silencing 
is a gratifying one — and 
rightfully so. As an audience 
member 
of 
IASA’s 
shows, 

however, the extent to which 
I share in the auditorium’s 
atmosphere of cultural pride 
has 
an 
unfortunate 
catch. 

At each show’s conclusion, I 
think about how I am Indian-
American, but not Indian-
American in the way that is 
portrayed on stage. Leaving 
the auditorium, in fact, marks 
the moments in which I don’t 
feel very Indian-American at 
all. During my sophomore year, 
my cousin visited campus. We 
planned to attend a show, and 
walked without sharing our 
thoughts for a while. When we 
reached Hill Auditorium, he 
took it all in: the bold kurtas 
and 
jugis, 
the 
unashamed 

laughs and glittering salwar 
kameezes, muttering “Y’all are 
here with the glamor, huh?”

My desire to connect with 

my heritage has grown, but I 
have avoided 
doing so by 
participating 
in IASA. This 
is 
because 

IASA has the 
capacity 
to 

both 
define 

and reinforce 
what the most 
expressive 
elements 
of 
Indian-

American 
identity 
are, 

and 
exclude 

all 
that 

doesn’t 
vibe 

with 
that 

expression. I 
interpret IASA’s influence, a 
bit regretfully, as a monolithic 
reference point for a lot that 
lies outside of my experience. 
The Indian-American identity 
I 
inhabited 
growing 
up 

did not incorporate Indian 
culture, which was isolated 
to destination places: Once a 
year, my family would journey 
to the suburbs of Indian stores 
and Hindu temples. Of my bare 
smattering of Bengali, I still 
fail to pronounce the words 

like a natural. And Bollywood’s 
tendency to intertwine wealth, 
lighter-skinned leads and the 
escapism 
of 
romanticizing 

an Indian existence reaches 
an excess I find unrelatable. 
I’m still figuring out how to 
incorporate these contrarian 
views into an identity that 
determines its own kind of 
pride and confidence. One that 
is comfortable in singularity, 
not being of a normative sense 
of national pride. It can thus 
be difficult to separate my 
critiques of Bollywood from 
my critiques of IASA’s cultural 
show, 
as 
it 
incorporates 

Bollywood-esque music and 
dance. As I think the show 
neatly deflects from the bruises 
that come with the territory of 
being Indian-American, I tend 
to spend more time dwelling 
on these than on the honorific 
spaces that have been afforded 
Indian culture in America 
today. These spaces are not 
conducive to the upbringing 

that 
has 

shaped 
my 

understanding 
of 
what 

being a first-
generation 
Indian 
American 
entails.

Having 

immigrated to 
America during 
the 1980s, my 
parents 
had 

experiences 
that 
I 
still 

consider when 
figuring 
out 

the extent to 
which I desire 

to adopt Indian culture. They 
came to live in a small town. 
My parents often felt cut off 
from the larger South Asian 
community as they struggled 
to assimilate into the rural 
place of their new home. Apart 
from the previous ones in 
which they would share their 
story, the moments when my 
parents publicly acknowledged 
their nationality were typically 
of defense and passivity, in 
reaction to racial hostility. 
Their 
acquirement 
of 

American citizenship began 
a process in which they lost 
cultural solidarity and gained 
ambivalent experiences. These 
characteristics 
are 
part 
of 

the bargain that citizenship 
offers, and come in an invisible 
package 
compared 
to 
the 

obvious benefits that being an 
American confers. The steps 
they took in consolidating their 
ethnic and national identities 
happened to lag behind those 
that strengthened toward a 
visible, prideful harmonization 
between ethnicity and culture. 
Dwelling on how they became 
Americans, 
I 
realize 
the 

privileged dimension of being 
able to form the public presence 
of one’s cultural identity. I 
understand how my quiet pride 
of not identifying with Indian 
culture is marginal to the 
expressive freedoms that being 
Indian-American entails today.

All of this is not to say that 

I don’t have a certain love for 
the show. As the performance 
of cultural fusion hits the mark 
of entrancing crowds, it allows 
me to become distracted from 

a divide that has introduced 
me 
to 
more 
ambivalence 

than clarity. Within a sweet 
period, I would observe how 
performance 
enables 
an 

extreme of cultural pride, and 
focus on the brilliant lengths 
that culture-based pride can 
go. However, I think a crucial 
aspect of IASA’s shows is 
the construction of a space 
that allows Indian-American 
millennials 
to 
temporarily 

forget 
moments 
that 
have 

negatively defined our own 
minority experiences. These 
experiences, I would argue, 
distinguish 
Indian-American 

culture from Indian culture. 
Thus, I believe that cultural 
shows 
would 
carry 
more 

constructive messages if they 
were to publicly discuss the 
meaning of the very American 
bruises that have, at some level, 
defined who we are. As I do not 
recognize an elaboration on the 
hyphenated distinction, which 
has been central to at least 
my understanding of Indian-
American identity, the show 
apparently subordinates such 
bruises to its Indian-centric 
pride. 
This 
subordination 

would be problematic, as it 
would neglect to represent 
a 
fuller 
range 
of 
Indian-

American 
experiences. 
To 

me, IASA’s show is not merely 
a 
celebration 
of 
cultural 

songs 
and 
dances. 
It’s 
a 

representation of how I have 
yet to touch upon a radiance of 
feeling similar to that which 
IASA members dance on stage 
with. Within my hands, such a 
spark would further promote 
an identity that is diametric 
to the idealized traditions of 
IASA’s celebration.

It is unfortunate that I do 

not have an uncomplicated 
attachment to the cultural 
show — to the rhythm-scape of 
our campus’s Little India. But 
as regional and psychological 
differences dynamically stitch 
the intra-ethnic experience, 
they 
produce 
lives 
whose 

cultural 
practices 
intersect 

and superimpose as lines and 
patterns do. I often think about 
this comparison in a crude 
way: I grew up in a small town 
far away and haven’t formed 
strong or even partial heritage 
ties. I hesitate to embrace 
the University of Michigan’s 
provision of a cultural capsule’s 
yearly parade to the center of 
the stage.
For the sake of tempering 
performances 
with 
realism 

and expressing the triumphs 
of 
hyphenated 
American 

nationalities, 
in 
addition 

to the moments that have 
silenced them, I would love 
to see a certain space emerge 
on campus. In this space, 
cultural organizations would 
acknowledge and expand upon 
the privilege of many millennial 
minorities 
to 
culturally 

express themselves, if they 
think doing so is fundamental 
to their sense of ethnic and 
national identities. Not only 
would such a space better 
attract those who come from 
muted channels of expression 
like I do, but also help more 
millennial 
minorities 
stand 

up and respect the bruises 
our immigrant forebears first 
experienced

Skin care and make up

Beauty has always been a 

focus of my life and my daily 
routines, and whether that is 
due to cultural pressures or 
genuine interest is something 
that is still foreign to me. 
But, what I do know is it’s 
something in which I have 
grown 
to 
have 
a 
strong 

interest.

However, it’s always been 

a bit difficult navigating the 
world of skincare and makeup 
while having darker skin.

I used to wear a foundation 

that made me look like a 
walking fire alarm because 
drugstore foundation brands 
have never heard of a Brown 
or Black person with skin 
that doesn’t have red or gray 
undertones (because clearly, 
there 
are 
so 
many 
dark 

women who are just itching 
to have a foundation that’s 
their shade but makes them 
look like they’re ready for 
their funeral). Over the past 
few years brands have been 
stepping it up, and with the 
launch of Fenty Beauty (♥), this 
movement for darker people to 
have foundation shades has 
launched even further than I 
ever thought I would see it go 
in the next decade.

My relationship with my 

skin has been … tumultuous, 
to say the least. It still is, 
and while my skin is far 
from perfect, I’ve invested 
much research and time into 
learning about skin, especially 
darker skin. My hormones 
are always out of whack, and 
I’ve struggled with acne for 
the past eight years. So I was 
obviously inclined to start 
wearing makeup as a way to 
cover up all the scarring that’s 
been left over from my past 
acne. While that has led to me 
to be a makeup enthusiast, at 
heart I will always continue to 
be a skincare junkie.

Speaking of scarring, let’s 

talk about it! Because nobody 
else will.

Scarring is naturally bound 

to remain longer on darker 
skin just due to the fact that 
dark skin has more melanin. 
Of all the skin types, the 
darkest are dark Asian skin 
(e.g., Indian, Sri Lankan or 
Malaysian), 
Afro-Caribbean 

and 
Black 
skin 
(generally 

African origin, but can also 
originate from West Indian/
Caribbean 
people). 
Afro-

Caribbean/Black skin has the 
highest melanin concentration 
out of any category of ethnic 
skin type.

The more melanin you have, 

the darker your skin, so your 
scars from past blemishes 
will be that much stronger. 
Inflammation occurs under 
and 
over 
the 
skin 
when 

you have a pimple, and the 
inflammation leaves a longer-
lasting mark on darker skin.

Most 
skincare 
for 
dark 

marks is marketed toward 
whom beauty products have 
always been targeting: white 
women. 
Because 
they 
can 

inhale the mere scent of aloe 
vera gel and have their scars 
disappear, and we already 
know that this is not the case 
for darker people. I’m here to 
talk about what things work 
for us, scientifically speaking, 
and what things absolutely do 
not.

Number one on the list 

is 
extremely 
harmful 
yet 

extremely powerful to lighten 
dark marks: hydroquinone.

Hydroquinone, also known 

as devil juice, is a common 
ingredient 
used 
in 
skin 

lightening 
and 
bleaching 

treatments for darker women, 
as it is so powerful that it will 
penetrate the skin barrier to 
lighten up dark marks.

But, 
I 
beg 
you, 
please 

don’t ever use this. If your 
dermatologist 
recommends 

hydroquinone, run the other 

direction.

Hydroquinone, 
on 
dark 

skin, can often worsen dark 
marks; not only that, the 
ingredient can be toxic as it 
does have some carcinogenic 
and 
mutagenic 
properties. 

While 
the 
Federal 
Drug 

Administration has concluded 
it is okay in small doses (4 
percent 
concentration 
in 

skincare products), it still 
can cause adverse reactions 
not just on a surface level, 
but internally provoke DNA 
alterations and mutations. 

Hydroquinone 
is 
often 

seen as an easier way out just 
because of how fast it works, 
but the effects on your health 
in the long term are absolutely 
not worth it!

But I’m not just going to 

leave you with this as you go 
to mope and believe there is 
no way out to your situation, 
because that’s not true in the 
slightest.

One of the things that you 

can do to prevent your dark 
marks 
from 
getting 
even 

darker is wearing sunscreen. 
If you think you don’t need it 
because you’ve never gotten 
a sunburn, you’re so wrong. 
You’re not just wrong, you’re 
loathsome. Go wear your SPF, 
immediately. This isn’t even 
relating to just surface-level 
appearance, but skin cancer 
is a sneaky rat and SPF helps 
prevent 
skin 
cancer. 
You 

should aim for an SPF of at 
least 30, and some good ones 
that won’t leave an ashy/purple 
cast on your skin include:

 Supergoop! Unseen 

Sunscreen 
Broad 
Spectrum 

SPF 40

 Aveeno Positively Radiant 

Sheer Daily Moisturizer with 
SPF 30

 Neutrogena Hydro Boost 

Water Gel Lotion with SPF 50 
(for my dry skin girls!)

Number two on the list is 

glycolic acid. Another thing 
you can do to actively start 
lightening 
some 
of 
these 

marks is to use products with 
concentrations 
of 
glycolic 

acid on your face, especially 
if your skin is new to acids. 
A good example of a product 
with this ingredient is the Pixi 
Glow Tonic. It has a bit of a 
lower concentration than most 
products, which is why it’s a 
great way to build up tolerance 
to 
products 
with 
higher 

concentrations. Once you’ve 
built up tolerance, you can 
try using products containing 
ascorbic acid, the original 
form of Vitamin C, if you find 
glycolic acid concentrations 
don’t hurt your skin.

Number three on the list 

is Mandelic acid. If you have 
already used products with 
concentrations of acids on 
your face for a long period of 
time before (azelaic acid and 
salicylic acid are two of the 
most commonly used ones), or 
if glycolic acid irritates your 
skin, give mandelic acid a go! 
Mandelic acid is especially 
good if you have a richer skin 
tone, and has been shown 
to have less of an irritating 
effect. Remember with any of 
these products to always test 
on the corner of your face or 
your hand before plastering it 
all over your face; it’s always 
better to be safe rather than 
sorry with skincare.

Remember while these will 

take much more investment 
and time than hydroquinone, 
the long-term benefit is so 
worth it. While it is always 
better to go to a dermatologist 
than to listen to some college 
student, if you have a darker 
skin tone, it can be easy to get 
products that only irritate your 
skin further. So, make sure you 
know how your dermatologist 
works 
with 
darker 
skin. 

Research, time and diligence 
are your three keys to glowing 
and golden skin. Put the effort 
in, and your skin will reward 
you!

Aidan Hutchinson hype train gaining steam

Get anyone in the Michigan 
football 
program 
going 
on 
freshman defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson, 
and 
it 
soon 
becomes clear how high they 
are on him. 
Ask 
fifth-year 
senior 
defensive lineman Lawrence 
Marshall.
“Oh my god, Aidan, from the 
first day until now, making a 
huge jump. That kid will be an 
All-American here.”
Ask junior defensive end 
Rashan Gary, a potential future 
top-10 NFL draft pick: 
“I tell him all the time, my 
freshman year, he’s ahead of 
where I was.”
Ask his position coach, Greg 
Mattison:
“All I know is when Aidan 
was recruited, and watching 
Aidan play in high school and 
watching him in camp and 
watching him in games, his 
future is very, very bright.”
Four games into Hutchinson’s 
Michigan career, the hype is 
deafening. Hutchinson — barely 
18 years old — has publicly 
tempered expectations, saying, 
“that’s cool, but I have a lot to 
work on” when asked about 
Marshall’s 
All-American 
prediction.
But his performance thus far 
speaks for itself.
Despite playing behind Gary 
and fifth-year senior Chase 
Winovich, 
Hutchinson 
has 
seen action in all four games 
this season. Against Western 
Michigan, 
the 
freshman 
notched six tackles. Late in the 
second quarter of Saturday’s 
game 
against 
Nebraska, 
Hutchinson 
diagnosed 
a 
screen pass from Cornhuskers 
quarterback Adrian Martinez 
and batted the attempt back in 
the air. Martinez caught his own 
attempt in the Nebraska end 
zone, but Hutchinson knocked 
him down, forcing Martinez 
into an intentional grounding 

penalty out of desperation, 
resulting in a safety.
It was a glimpse of the 
athleticism, intelligence and 
relentlessness 
that, 
by 
all 
accounts, Hutchinson has been 
showing in practice all year.
“He’s strong, he goes hard, 
he’s smart. Like he really 
understands football,” Marshall 
said Tuesday. “Like a lot of 
freshmen, when they come in, 
they really don’t understand the 
adjustments from high school to 
college. He really understands 
football.”
That 
would 
make 
sense, 
given 
his 
family 
pedigree. 
Hutchinson’s 
father, 
Chris, 
played at Michigan from 1988-
1992, 
earning 
All-Big 
Ten 
honors his final two seasons 
and an All-American selection 
his senior season.
Chris totaled 11 sacks in 1992 
and finished his career with 20, 
then the second-highest total in 
school history.
Mattison 
coached 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
line 
in 1992, and says “(Chris) 
may be the best I’ve had the 
opportunity to coach.” 

“Obviously him being an 
All-American here, obviously 
I know there’s a high standard 
for me,” Aidan said Tuesday. 
“I think, but I set my own 
expectation for myself, and I set 
the bar for myself.”
For the time being, his snap 
count will be limited by the 
presence of Gary and Winovich 
— two potential All-Big Ten 
ends who rarely take a play 
off, barring injury. Hutchinson 
has gained valuable in-game 
experience in the last three 
weeks, games Michigan has 
won by a total of 127 points.
Far 
from 
a 
hindrance, 
Mattison sees Gary’s presence 
in particular as valuable to 
Hutchinson’s growth. Mattison 
often 
sees 
Gary 
offering 
Hutchinson 
assistance 
in 
meetings and film sessions, 
which reminds the veteran 
coach of another player-to-
player relationship. 
“I can still remember (former 
defensive end) Chris Wormley 
sitting right next to Rashan, 
helping him every day with all 
of the things we were trying to 
do, and (Gary) listening, and 

him learning it, and doing better 
each day that way,” Mattison 
said. “Rashan is doing the exact 
same thing with Aidan.”
Hutchinson 
will 
almost 
certainly step into a more 
prominent role next season, 
with Winovich graduating and 
Gary likely headed to the NFL. 
He will occupy the same spot, 
in the same uniform, under the 
same coach that his father did 
during his All-America season.
If 
the 
first 
portion 
of 
his freshman season is any 
indication — and if Marshall’s 
words turn into reality — 
Hutchinson could quickly shed 
the title of “Chris’ son.” 
Mattison 
certainly 
thinks 
he’s on his way, even flashing 
some of the same skills that 
made Chris successful.
“Aidan has a lot of that in 
him,” Mattison said. “The good 
thing is Aidan has six more 
inches.”
Aidan 
Hutchinson 
has 
generated plenty of hype in his 
first few months on campus. 
But if what Mattison said is 
the case, not a word of it is 
hyperbole.

Moore earns praise in first year as tight ends coach

Jim 
Harbaugh, 
like 
any 
coach, loves to compliment his 
players.
So 
when 
the 
Michigan 
football 
coach 
was 
asked 
Monday, 
at 
his 
weekly 
press conference, about the 
development of redshirt junior 
tight end Zach Gentry, it was 
no surprise that Harbaugh 
had a lot to say about all of 
his tight ends — Gentry, along 
with juniors Sean McKeon and 
Nick Eubanks. He even gave a 
shoutout to former Wolverine 
Jake Butt, now a tight end with 
the NFL’s Denver Broncos.
And then at the end of his 
response, Harbaugh quickly 
added a compliment to first-
year tight ends coach Sherrone 
Moore.
“It’s just really good, good — 
tight ends, Sherrone Moore’s 
doing a heck of a job coaching 
this (group),” Harbaugh said. 
“… So proud of that.”
It’s a small gesture, but 
it still meant something to 
Moore, who joined the staff 
this 
offseason 
by 
way 
of 
Central Michigan. Does he get 
that praise often?
“From my wife,” Moore said 
Wednesday. 
“My mom, she’ll 
give 
me 
that 
sometimes. My 
wife 
actually 
told me about 
(Harbaugh’s 
comments), 
which 
was 
pretty cool. So, 
you know, I’m 
just blessed to 
be here and do 
whatever I can to make this 
team better and make this 
program better.”
Moore was dealt a strong 
hand when he arrived in Ann 
Arbor.
Not 
only 
does 
he 
have 
Gentry, McKeon and Eubanks, 
but 
Michigan 
also 
landed 
the No. 6 tight-end recruit 
in the 2018 recruiting class, 
Mustapha Muhammad.

And 
with 
Harbaugh’s 
fondness for two and three-
tight 
end 
sets, 
Moore 
is 
experiencing a wealth of riches 
he hasn’t enjoyed before.
“Last 
year 
at 
Central, 
we were more of a spread 
operation, 
so 
really only in 
one-tight 
end 
sets a majority 
of 
the 
game. 
Sometimes 
two,” 
Moore 
said. “But, you 
know, here, as 
you guys see, 
we’re in three-
tight end sets, 
we’re early in 
the game three-tight end sets. 
Then I’ve got all three of them 
yelling at us, ‘Don’t take us 
off the field, ‘cause you saw 
us score.’ And I’m like, ‘Guys, 
chill out.’
“But, you know, it’s really 
cool to be a part of a program 
that does that and to be a part 
of that. And when you have 
weapons like that, it’s good to 
use them like that.”

Last 
season, 
Gentry 
(303) 
and 
McKeon 
(301) 
had the second and third-
most receiving yards on the 
team, and they had the most 
receiving touchdowns as well 
— two and three, respectively.
Those 
aren’t 
staggering 
numbers, 
but 
on a team that 
struggled to pass 
the ball, the tight 
ends were often 
the safety valve. 
That dimension 
was already in 
their repertoire.
This 
season, 
they’re 
contributing 
in 
the 
run 
game, too. That aspect was 
a major knock against the 
tight ends last season, but the 
improvement 
is 
something 
Moore has noticed firsthand.
“Their strength from the 
spring to now the gains that 
they get, you know, I hold the 
bag sometimes for them and 
feel a little bit of a different 
thump when they hit it,” 

Moore said. “So that was a 
pretty cool feeling, to feel the 
difference of their strength 
there. But to watch those 
guys really improve from a 
fundamental standpoint with 
their hands and their feet has 
been 
really 
cool and really 
has come to 
fruition 
on 
gameday.”
Moore 
is 
quick 
to 
deflect praise. 
He 
credits 
strength 
and 
conditioning 
coach 
Ben 
Herbert 
for 
the tight ends’ improvement 
in 
blocking. 
He 
lauds 
wide 
receivers 
coach 
Jim 
McElwain 
for 
passing 
on 
some knowledge to him. And 
he credits the talents of his 
players for the rest.
But there is no doubt that 
Moore is doing something 
right. If he weren’t, his praise 
would still just be coming 
from his wife and his mom.

Teske preparing for 
bigger role with ‘M’

Last March, Jon Teske sat 
with a towel draped over his 
neck and a long sleeve warm-
up masking his mostly dry 
jersey.
Twenty feet away, Moritz 
Wagner 
terrorized 
the 
Loyola-Chicago defense as he 
hit a turnaround three, found 
Charles Matthews with a 
backdoor bounce pass and 
charged into the paint for a 
3-point play, before capping 
the stretch with a three from 
the top of the key.
In four minutes, he took 
Michigan from a three-point 
deficit to the precipice of the 
national championship game.
“Not too many people in 
the country have the same 
skillset as Moe,” Matthews 
said Tuesday afternoon.
It’s 
a 
stretch 
that 
exemplifies 
what 
Wagner 
meant to the 
Wolverines. 
On an offense 
whose 
identity 
was 
being able to 
shoot from all 
five positions, 
the 
6-foot-11 
center 
paced 
the team with 
a 39.4 3-point 
shooting 
percentage and 14.6 points 
per game.
With Wagner now gone to 
the NBA, Teske, who played 
just three minutes in that 
game in San Antonio, moves 
to center stage.
But he’s not Moe Wagner, 
and there’s no hiding that. 
Wagner pierced the net 110 
times from beyond the arc 
over the past three years. At 
7-foot-1, Teske is an elite rim 
protector who adds another 
dimension 
to 
Michigan’s 
dominant defense but has 
never made a collegiate three. 
His 
most 
recent 
attempt 
came in the dying minutes of 
a 45-point game against UC 
Riverside last November.
“He’s 
one 
of 
a 
kind,” 
Matthews said of Wagner. “So 
yeah, we’re definitely gonna 
have to play 
differently.”
Had Wagner 
returned 
for 
his senior year, 
this would be 
a 
Michigan 
team 
with 
few 
question 
marks.
It 
would 
carry 
its 
offensive 
identity from last season, 
with 
sophomore 
guard 
Jordan Poole slotting in for 
the graduated Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman. 
The 
biggest 
change 
would 
be 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
providing 
a 
different type of spark off the 
bench 
than 
sharpshooting 
forward Duncan Robinson.

In 
the 
turbulent 
landscape 
of 
college 
basketball, that would make 
the Wolverines one of the 
nation’s steadiest presences 
from a season ago.
But, as expected, Wagner 

declared for the draft and 
will be playing alongside 
LeBron James in Los Angeles 
next month. In his stead, 
Teske’s development will be 
key to whether Michigan’s 
offense can match a defense 
that ranked third in Ken 
Pomeroy’s adjusted efficiency 
metric last season.
“Big Sleep has been doing 
very 
well 
in 
practice,” 
Matthews said, using Teske’s 
nickname. “And I think he’ll 
continue to grow.”
The 
most 
surprising 
development 
for 
Teske 
may come from beyond the 
3-point line. Though he’s only 
attempted 
two 
3-pointers 
in his college career, he 
regularly shot two or three a 
game in high school.
“Jon Teske has shot the 
ball really well (in practice),” 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
said. “Having a big man that 
can shoot, you all see what 
can happen, it 
made everybody 
else better last 
year. 
Having 
Jon be able to do 
that, … (that’s) 
big to get those 
big men that can 
shoot.”
Added Teske: 
“That 
(3-point 
shooting) 
is 
one thing that 
(Beilein) has seen me grow 
with. I’ve been showing him 
that I’m capable of shooting a 
three.”
It’s a different type of 
3-point 
shooting 
than 
Wagner, who could shoot in 
nearly any situation. Teske 
anticipates that his looks 
from deep will come as a 
trailer in transition or off of 
pick-and-pops.
But after losing their top 
three long ball shooters, the 
Wolverines will take all the 
help Teske can give them.
Knowing 
that 
Wagner 
was 
likely 
leaving, 
Teske 
spent the last year studying 
him and learning his craft. 
They roomed together on 
road trips, allowing Teske 
to learn from him at every 
opportunity. Even now, with 
Wagner on the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
country, 
the two keep 
in 
regular 
communication 
by texting.
“I was just 
picking 
his 
brain 
here 
and 
there 
and 
he’s 
just 
a 
great 
guy,” 
Teske said. “… He’s always 
somebody that I look to, kind 
of like a big brother to me.”
Added 
Beilein: 
“Let’s 
face it, we lost our three top 
shooters. That’s a lot of threes 
in those three and high-
percentage guys. So we have 
to replace that somehow.”
Believe it or not, Teske 
might be crucial to Michigan’s 
chances of doing that.
“Now that Moe’s gone, it’s 
my turn to step up,” Teske 
said. “And I think with my 
capability shooting the three, 
I can really stretch the floor 
and help us win games.”

EVAN AARON/Daily
Junior center Jon Teske is looking to replace Moe Wagner at the 3-point line.

“(Teske) has 
been doing 
very well in 
practice.”

“Now that 
Moe’s gone, it’s 
my turn to step 
up.”

straight without using any 
other chemicals. You’re almost 
a preferred, VIP Black person, 
and 
that’s 
unfortunate,” 

Hopkins said.

The 
same 
is 
true 
in 

many 
other 
cultures 
and 

communities, but all art will 
have its critics. In the same way 
artists learn to love what spills 
from their hearts onto the 
canvas, women of color learn to 
embrace their “preferred” hair 
type.

Liznel 

Ferreira, 
a 

former stylist, 
also 
had 
to 

come to terms 
with her hair.

“Now I love it 

because I know 
I can wear it so 
many different 
ways … it was 
a 
process 
in 

figuring 
out 

how to manage 
my 
hair,” 

Ferreira said.

This 

movement 
from 
relaxed 

to natural hair 
is not just a 
reflection 
of 

self-identity, 
but it’s a fight 
against history 
and the social 
norm 
when 

the 
society 

is telling you 
that your curls, 
your 
personal 

identity 
and 

art form, are 
wrong.

“Growing up, 

my hair was always compared 
to my sisters’ hair because 
their curls were softer. I grew 
up putting relaxer in my hair,” 
Ferreira explained.

When I was younger, I 

straightened my hair often 

because I saw that as beautiful. 
Toward the end of high school, 
I finally stopped fighting my 
hair and tapped into the cosmic 
energy both Zinis and Hopkins 
felt in their hair by nurturing 
my natural curl pattern. It was 
the most freeing decision I 
have ever made, and it is a bold 
statement I make as a woman 
of color.

“Natural hair is huge: it’s big, 

it’s unruly, it’s uncontrollable 
… you are literally saying, ‘This 
is what freedom looks like.’ 
And that is something that 
is scary to people, especially 
pertaining to WOC. We are 
the bottom of the totem pole 
when it comes to privilege and 
status,” Hopkins explained.

Like art, hair is a political 

and 
personal 
statement, 

especially for women of color 
like myself and Hopkins. Hair 
sends a message out into the 
world that we are here and 
we are going to take up space 
and display the art that grows 
naturally out of our scalps 
unforgivingly.

“I’m going to take up space. 

A lot of it. I’m going to take up 
all of your space, and you are 
going to have to deal with it,” 
Hopkins exclaimed.

Just as one would go to a 

museum and not touch the 
artwork, the same rules apply 
for hair. What grows out of our 
scalps is our own work — one 
that Michelangelo cannot even 
truly recreate. No matter what 
type of hair, or lack of hair, you 
are making a statement. It is a 
masterpiece in itself. We have 
to uplift and encourage each 
other by educating ourselves 
about the nature of the artwork 
and the history surrounding 
it to truly appreciate and 

understand 
it. 

This starts with 
education.

“When I was 

23, I decided to 
go to cosmetology 
school,” 
Ferreira 

said. 
“When 
I 

was there, I did 
not learn how to 
deal with hair of 
my texture. … We 
always worked on 
fine hair.”

If we knew more 

about 
hair 
and 

could 
appreciate 

the uniqueness of 
it, then maybe we 
would not be so 
scared to let loose 
and let our natural 
self-expression.

Our 
hair, 
or 

lack 
thereof, 

shapes 
who 
we 

are. It tells the 
world who we are. 
Hair offends and 
confuses. It brings 
people 
together 

and 
alienates. 

Hair 
frustrates 

us, 
finds 
us 

community 
and 

validates 
our 

identities. Hair makes us feel 
new and vibrant, giving us new 
energy and empowerment that 
we never knew we had inside of 
us. It is a powerful connector 
and divider, and we decide 
where the trajectory goes.

Dissecting the art of hair in AA & beyond

Nothing compares to that 

feeling you get when you walk 
out of the salon with a fresh 
haircut, that feeling of newness 
and transformation when you 
leave the hair salon. For those 
few moments, you strut out 
of the salon and feel like you 
can 
conquer 
anything 
that 

comes your way, feel like you’re 
validated and you want people 
to notice you. If we take a 
moment to consider this, it’s so 
strange to think these strands 
of keratin and dead skin cells 
can make us feel so on top of 
the world. This strangeness 
is common for clients and the 
hair stylists who create this art 
growing out of our heads.

Nicholaus Zinis, owner and 

stylist of Nola’s Underground 
Salon, is a bald man with a 
passion for hair. Walking down 
the dingy, narrow staircase 
into a basement to get to 
Nola’s 
Underground 
Salon, 

I was bombarded by colors 
and designs that released a 
sort of cosmic energy into 
the atmosphere. As I walked 
through the fuzzy wallpapered 
space, my eyes were inundated 
with 
velvet 
and 
random 

antiques hanging all over the 
wall. Zinis, a colorful man in 
fantastic flowy pants, promptly 
greeted me.

When we think of artists, we 

seldom think of hairstylists. We 
think of the struggling artist, 
someone who has a paranormal 
connection 
with 
a 
canvas. 

For Zinis, his canvas is hair. 
He uses universal energy and 
this seemingly otherworldly 
inspiration to do his work and 
create art.

“If you look at the hair, read 

it and touch it, it will tell you 
what it wants to do,” Zinis 
said. “I can’t even claim credit 
for the haircut, it just flows. 
You tap into the universal love 
that flows through your arms. 
Every haircut I do takes three 
seconds; my day goes by in 
minutes.”

Zinis is a doctor in hair 

practice, 
scientist 
of 
color 

and artist of style all in one. 
He mixes colors and creates 
masterpieces, each one unique 
in its own way. He is aware 
every single person who walks 
through the doors of his salon 
is different — both in hair and 
personality.

“Sane people don’t do hair 

… you have to deal with a lot of 
personalities and pure, crazy 
chaos,” Zinis said.

For Zinis, it is not just about 

shaping art, but the personal 
connections he makes as a 
stylist. He quit his corporate job 
to become a hairstylist, and has 
since been surprisingly fulfilled 
with the human connections he 
has made with his clients. That 
wonderful connection we feel 
with our stylists is genetically 
predisposed.

“How 
do 
animals 
bond? 

Through 
grooming,” 
Zinis 

explained. “When you groom 
each other, you sit in the chair 
and it’s just diarrhea of the 
mouth.”

“I had a group of students, 

and they left in April and none 
of them got their hair cut in the 
summertime because they were 
like, ‘It’s not the same, I can’t 
get my hair cut now.’ They came 
back in the fall with a summer’s 
worth growth of hair, and they 
were like, ‘I wanted to wait to 
get my haircut with you.’”

You establish a close bond 

with your stylist by working 
together to express yourself 
through hair. Stylists humble 
themselves 
by 

washing 
your 

hair, placing you 
in a vulnerable 
state. 
The 

trust 
that 
you 

immediately 
give to another 
person to shape 
this 
new 
part 

of you, to help 
create 
your 

identity 
and 

show it to the 
world 
is 
such 

an 
intimate 

experience.

“We’ve 
had 

people who are 
suicidal 
who 

come and get a 
haircut,” 
Zinis 

explained. 
He 

shared a story of 
a client who had 
decided not to 
commit 
suicide 

after getting a 
haircut because 
Zinis 
had 

listened to him 
and showed care 
for him when he 
came 
into 
his 

studio.

“So 
is 
it 
a 

haircut? No, it’s so much more 
than that.”

Hair is art, beautiful and 

expressive, but we often miss 
telling another side of the story. 
Just as visual and performance 
art shapes culture, so does hair. 

A side of the story that has been 
brushed under the rug for too 
long is the story of hair as an 
art form for women of color. It 
is through the experiences of 
women of color that expression 
through hair has been an 
essential part of identity for 
a long time, and it is time we 
notice.

Growing up, I was known 

as the girl with the long hair. I 
remember one of my elementary 

school 
teachers 

taking 
out 
a 

ruler to measure 
the length of my 
hair in front of 
the entire class, 
commenting 
on 
its 
length 

and 
fullness. 
I 

grew up around 
the 
smell 
of 

burnt 
hair 
in 

the 
Dominican 

hair 
salons 
in 

Washington 
Heights, 
New 

York; the sound 
of 
mighty 

Dominican 
stylists chatting 
loudly in Spanish 
about the latest 
gossip 
of 
the 

neighborhood; 
the 
sounds 
of 

praise over my 
“good” 
hair. 

The heat of the 
blow dryer is a 
distinct feeling I 
will never forget. 
My 
hair 
was 

being shaped by 
these 
women, 

and at the same 
time they were 

shaping me and who I was.

As I grew older, I started 

to get my hair cut in upscale 
salons 
in 
SoHo. 
There, 
I 

became 
accustomed 
to 
the 

smell 
of 
bleached 
hair. 
I 

familiarized myself with the 

side-eyed glances of straight-
haired blonde women toward 
my dark and curly hair. I grew 
used to being pampered, being 
offered 
complimentary 
tea 

and paying at least $125 for a 
haircut. My hair evolved into 
bragging rights for me — how 
much I spent on my haircut 
and products, the length of 
my hair, and the beautiful and 
perfect curl texture that took 
form. My curls were a sign of 
my privilege, the privilege of 
fitting more into the white 
normative than other people of 
color, especially women.

Khalya 
Hopkins, 
an 

employee for the New York 
City Department of Education 
and one of the fiercest women 
to which I have ever spoken, 
wears her own “crown of glory” 
with pride, as her art comes to 
form in a very different manner. 
She found art in her hair with 
bantu knots and hair wraps, 
both ways of wearing your 
hair when “transitioning,” a 
term that describes the process 
women of color, usually women 
with kinky hair, undergo when 
shifting from putting chemicals 
in their hair to wearing it 
natural.

“People 
don’t 
understand 

that when you do transitions, 
that’s almost like a spiritual 
journey,” Hopkins said. “You

age, becoming the first skinheads. 
Later, the name “skinhead” would 
become associated with ugly 
nationalist rhetoric groups, but 
initially, it was just a descriptor 
for those who chose to buzz their 
hair in search of a bare-bones, 
stripped look.

Using appearance to solidify 

their 
identity, 
English 
youth 

began 
wearing 
ripped 
and 

distressed clothes, black, leather 
and, of course, spiking and cutting 
their hair. London punks gathered 
in places like Sloane Square to 
organize and meet other people 
like them, but as the movement 
gained traction, outsiders would 
often come to their hangouts to 
gawk at the variety of hairstyles 
on display. One of these haircuts, 
arguably the most famous of the 
punk movement, was the mohawk 
or 
mohican, 
a 
characteristic 

spiked ‘do running down the 

center of the head. The shock 
factor of these looks alone drew 
attention from the mainstream, 
and in turn, punk became a bigger 
and bigger phenomenon, their 
music and anarchist ideologies 
thrust into the public eye.

At the same time, musicians 

like 
Patti 
Smith 
and 
The 

Ramones began the same path in 
America, separating themselves 
from 
both 
the 
mainstream 

and hippie counterculture to 
begin something raw, new and 
profoundly powerful. New York 
City punk was less gaudy than 
London’s initial movement, but 
still presented itself as a legitimate 
social culture with a look to match. 
Though NYC is often credited 
with the beginnings of American 
punk culture, Los Angeles had 
its own burgeoning punk scene, 
and eventually, the movement 
spread to most major cities. The 
leather and distress of English 
punk made its way into American 
punk culture, some taking an 
almost identical approach, but 
many people in the States chose 
to bypass the extreme hairstyles 
of punk fame and instead opt for 
a messy, slept-in look, long and 
unkempt as if to say: “I don’t care 
what I look like, what matters is 
the message.”

By the late ’70s, punk was a 

massive force in youth culture 
and counterculture as a whole, 
and the appropriation of its 
characteristic looks began to 
flow into the mainstream. Bands 
like the New York Dolls started 
subgroups like glam punk, which 
took the basic elements of punk 
and brought them to a draggy, 
over-the-top level, sporting high-
femme makeup and big teased 
hair in an effort to distinguish 
themselves. Art punk formed 
in bands like Television, who 
grew out of drug culture and 
into almost avant-garde music 
and performance. In addition to 
glam and art, the punk movement 
started to fracture into dozens of 
these smaller subcultures with 
their own looks and ideologies. 
But there was still a distinct 
emphasis on the purposeful self-

“othering” of punks through their 
choices in clothes and hairstyles, 
something that lives on today 
in these shattered pieces of the 
original movement.

As the ’80s came and went, 

punk grew into its own, and so 
did the movements it inspired, 
like hardcore and eventually post-
punk. Many of the bands who 
transitioned into the latter two 
categories even began as part of 
the original punk rock movement, 
but then separated themselves as 
the subculture grew and changed. 
The looks that accompanied both 
were noticeably less extreme 
and shocking than many of early 
punk’s 
trademarks, 
choosing 

comfort and the ability to mosh 
over the spiked extravagance 
and upkeep of their predecessors. 
Their hairstyles followed this, 
either settling into the Patti 
Smith mold of languid disinterest 
and shag or completely buzzing 
it off in order to follow the raw 
intensity of their music. This 
continued into the next two 
decades, as post-punk, grunge 
and emo rock carried the spirit 
of the original punk movement 
into the future and with it the 
style which separated them from 
the mainstream. The remnants of 
punk are everywhere, in music, 
culture and of course, in hair.

Now, extreme colors and cuts 

are more common than in the ’70s, 
but the value of unique styling has 
stayed the same — ultimately, 
hair is an easy way to separate 
yourself from the masses, to 
express culture through your 
appearance and show it for all to 
see. It is clear how the hairstyles 
of each facet of punk matched 
and enhanced their mission as 
subcultures, drawing attention to 
themselves in an effort to subvert 
and in turn highlight the reality 
of social norms. The superficial 
shock factor of a mohawk is 
obvious, but the history behind 
it may not be. At the end of the 
day, it’s just hair, after all, but 
its power to shift perception is a 
foundational aspect of the punk 
movement’s history, influence and 
proliferation into the present day.

CAPITAL RECORDS

Recently, 
a 
longstanding, 

unspoken personal bond was 
finally broken: Justin Bieber and I 
no longer have the same hairstyle. 
With news of his engagement to 
Hailey Baldwin came paparazzi 
photos of him, hair wild and 
shaggy, sporting a mustache that 
screams “I’ve been listening to a lot 
of Post Malone lately and doing just 
fine.” 

I was a prepubescent boy 

(i.e., dumb) during the “Baby” 
heyday, so naturally I harbored 
a completely irrational yet deep-
seated aversion of the singing, 
dancing Canadian. Irony is a fickle 
mistress though, as one can scroll 
down to the murkiest depths 
of my Facebook profile and see 
tagged photos from the early 2010s 
featuring a tinier me sporting the 
same side-swooped bowl cut.

Like clockwork, if Bieber ever 

changed his hair, I would somehow 
end up with the same haircut – 
albeit a couple months behind – 
despite laughing at all the “memes” 
mocking his androgynous looks 
or imploring God to give us back 
Michael Jackson if we offered 
Bieber up in sacrifice. Slightly 
shorter bowl cut Bieber? Been 

there. Shaved on the sides, styled 
long on the top Bieber? Done that. 
I may have lost him for a bit in 2017 
when he both shaved his head and 
went back to the bowl, the look 
closest associated with his rise to 
superstardom. But when I decided 
to dye my hair platinum blond, our 
souls were briefly realigned and 
everything was alright.

The 
platinum 
blond 
trend 

in men’s hair has increased 
exponentially over the past few 
years. This summer, Zayn Malik 
went blond, Pete Davidson went 
blond, Charlie Puth went blond; 
even a handful of Mexican soccer 
players went blond for a World 
Cup match. Through its adoption 
by many of the best-groomed men 
in Hollywood and the fashion 
industry, the trend’s en vogue 
status has become solidified. The 
fact GQ articles detailing some 
facet of the platinum blond dyeing 
process keep cropping up once a 
year speaks to its lasting power.

It’s easy to dismiss platinum 

blond as a fad, and that a decade 
from now we’ll be looking at it with 
the same disdain we now have 
for frosted tips. On the notion of 
a fad, one must first understand 
frosted tips were far from one; the 
reignited boy band craze of the 
late ’90s and early ’00s solidified 
their cultural impact, and they 

were a commonplace hairstyle 
for many young guys over damn 
near a decade. Fads are lucky to 
stay around for a year, as pogs 
(milk caps) and fidget spinners are 
fated to be relegated to the dustbin 
of history. Trends like frosted 
tips stick around, becoming a 
cornerstone of their era’s defining 
aesthetic. We’re quick to associate 
nostalgia with fashion as it was 
something in which everyone 
technically participated. Everyone 
wanted 
to 
look 
like 
Justin 

Timberlake.

The thing is, not everyone wants 

to look like Malik or Davidson or 
Puth. Platinum blond hair seems 
to have caught on only among the 
upper echelon of men. If I walk 
around campus on an average day, 
I will only see two or three other 
boys with hair like mine, out of 
some thousands.

Whereas 
dyed 
hair 
is 
so 

ubiquitous among women, it still 
continues to be a taboo for some 
men. Hair dye has been around 
for centuries, with the earliest 
and most prominent adopters 
being the ancient Egyptians, and 
blond hair has its own history, too. 
Roman prostitutes were required 
to have yellow hair to indicate their 
professions, with some bathing 
their hair in a solution made 
from the ashes of burnt plants to

Mohawks. Buzz cuts. Tangled, 

teased, dyed, chopped, braided, 
long, short and any every color 
in the book. What do you think 
of when you think of punk hair? 
This is a broad question, but 
holds more meaning than it may 
seem. From its beginnings in the 
’70s in England and the United 
States, the punk movement has 
always been closely related to its 
members’ presentations in fashion 
and grooming, specifically hair. 
Though punk has split into many 
subgroups since its inception, the 
general consensus remains the 
same: To be punk is to subvert 
the status quo in every manner, 
especially in the way you look to 
others.

The separation between the 

mainstream and counterculture 
that functions as a foundation 
for the movement was initially 
and still is based heavily in 
presentation. This is something 
that has splintered into different 
subcultures in the past five 
decades but is still what many 
people imagine when they think 
of punk conceptually. In terms of 
appearance, punk hairstyles have 
become the primary marker for 
the masses to identify rebellion 
and subversion in public, an 
opportunity for members of the 
movement to “other” themselves 
in a way that is easy to reverse and 
change at a moment’s notice.

Punk and its offshoots have 

often gotten a bad rep in the 
media and society at large, in 
response to not only the ideology 
of their movements but also 
their 
appearance. 
Extremist 

submovements, like the white 

nationalist skinheads, have often 
overshadowed 
the 
meaning 

behind punk style from the 
beginning, and color the media’s 
portrayal of the culture as a whole 
with negativity. But in reality, 
punk and its attachment to style 
began as a way to subvert the 
expectations of mid-70s England, 
which was under the heavy veil 
of social pressure to conform as 
the post-war world erupted into 
turmoil once again.

Young people who resisted the 

norms of their world found solace 
in music from groups like the 
Sex Pistols and created a cultural 
movement that shifted the “free 
love” counterculture of hippies to 
a harsher, more direct response 
to political and social discord. In 
the late ’60s, the earliest members 
of the punk movement shaved 
their heads in protest of the long-
haired freedom of the Aquarian

achieve that color without need 
of a wig. Later in the 1700s, the 
color became fashionable and 
Italian women would sit out in the 
sun with their locks submerged 
in a corrosive solution for that 
luxurious blond color. French 
chemist Eugene Schueller created 
the first synthetic hair dye for 
commercial purpose in 1907, a 
product that would later become 
known as L’Oréal, and it quickly 
became easier than ever for 
women to change their hair color.

The 
list 
of 
iconic 
female 

blondes could span hundreds — 
Marilyn Monroe, Farrah Fawcett, 
Madonna, to name a few. But 
one would be hard-pressed to 
find a single male celebrity with 
platinum blond hair worthy of 
the moniker “icon.” This is partly 
because 
platinum 
blond 
hair 

on men, as previously stated, 
is a trend very localized in the 
2010s. Most celebrities who dye 
their hair, like Bieber, either just 
recently dyed it and have not put in 
the time necessary for icon status, 
or gave up maintaining the color 
after a year or so and switched to 
a new headline and eye-catching 
hairstyle.

There is, however, a young 

man on the verge of becoming 
synonymous with platinum blond 
hair. In 2017, Troye Sivan, a South 
African and Australian singer-
songwriter 
with 
unassuming 

mousy brown hair fresh off the 
success of his debut album Blue 
Neighborhood, posted on Twitter 
and Instagram pictures of his 
apparent blond curls. His fans 
were initially skeptical, though 
Troye made sure they knew it 
was no fake, no wig. Aside from 
this dramatic change and a few 
features, Sivan did not have a 
world-stopping 2017.

But this year, Troye is on top of 

the pop world. It’s been less than 
a month since his chart-topping 
sophomore 
effort 
Bloom 
was 

released, featuring the infectious 
anthem “My My My!” and the 
Ariana 
Grande 
collaboration 

“Dance To This.” His explosive 
popularity came seemingly out 
of nowhere, but it’s pretty easy to 
understand. What makes Sivan 
so different from his other male 
contemporaries? And what makes 
his hair such a statement? The 
answer lies in his unapologetic 
acceptance of his queerness.

As you may have assumed, the 

reason dyeing your hair is still 
taboo among most of the male 

population is it goes against all 
norms of traditional masculinity. 
For lack of a better word, going 
to a hairdresser and getting your 
hair dyed platinum blond could be 
seen as “gay.” In fact, while doing 
research for this article, I stumbled 
across a finely-worded Yahoo 
Answers query asking if it “would 
be gay if (he) dyed (his) hair 
platinum blonde” (he specifically 
requested “girls opinions on the 
matter” and declined requests for 
comment as he is both anonymous 
and asked about nine years ago). 
While the most mean-spirited of 
bullies would call another guy a 
“sissy” or “faggot” for dyeing their 
hair, their vitriol isn’t misdirected; 
most guys who are inclined to 
change the color of their hair are of 
a queer sexuality.

And why is that? While I am 

by no means qualified to speak 
for all non-heterosexual men, my 
hair has come to mean a lot to me. 
For years, I had sported haircuts 
so uninteresting they would fit 
snugly into any given fraternity 
composite. Once I began to come 
to terms that maybe there’s 
more to life than girlfriends, that 
guys can be pretty too, I became 
increasingly 
frustrated 
with 

my outward appearance. Easy 
to disappear into a crowd, the 
straight, 
brown-haired 
white 

freshman I appeared to be was at 
odds with the interior.

In all my social anxiety, I 

believed people looked at me and 
saw the most uninteresting man in 
the world. I wanted so desperately 
for them to not write me off as 
boring and shy but them to see me 
and instantly want to befriend the 
silly lovable idiot I am underneath. 
So a seed was planted and my plan 
was to dye my hair something 
radical Thanksgiving Break. I 
settled on platinum blond after 
scrolling through an unhealthy 
amount of Lucky Blue Smith 
pictures. That plan was derailed by 
the family and friends occupying 
my house for the holiday, so it was 
pushed back to December. I would 
bleach my hair over Christmas, 
only tell a very select few about 
it and surprise everyone else in 
person. One stinging three-hour 
visit to my mom’s favorite salon 
later and the plan was underway.

It’s now sophomore year, and 

has dyeing my hair platinum 
blond changed my life for the 
better? Well, yes and no. It hasn’t 
transformed me into some cherub 
of an extrovert with countless 

friends under his wings, but I do 
think it represents a more authentic 
version of myself. It represents 
someone who finally came to terms 
with their worst hidden struggles 
and no longer hates themselves 
for who they are. I’d be lying if I 
said the random compliments I 
get in public bathrooms or fast-
food restaurants don’t give me the 
slightest bit of confidence to keep 
going on particularly hard days. I 
have varied my hair color slightly, 
dabbling in pink and lavender, but 
platinum blond is my new home 
that always calls me back. I don’t 
even remember what I look like 
with brown hair.

Hair is one of the most 

important 
forms 
of 
personal 

expression, which is one of the 
most crucial things to the identity 
of any queer person, Troye Sivan 
and myself included. While he and 
I differ on the personal meaning of 
our platinum blond hair — Troye 
has always been public about 
his identity way before the hair 
change, while my acceptance of 
my identity coincided with the 
hair change (as my friends have 
chided me about, in a very Ralph 
Wiggum-type way) — both of us 
use hair as a means to love and 
accept who we are.

Troye Sivan’s hair has become 

very central to his brand in an 
amazing, celebratory kind of way. 
The album cover for Bloom is a 
black-and-white image of Sivan 
with his back facing the camera; 
the most prominent feature from 
that angle is his hair. The video for 
“My My My!” employs the same 
technique. As Troye dances in 
front of these empty, dimly-lit and 
monochromatic backdrops, and 
the platinum blond shines from 
every angle. It could be reductive 
to say all of one’s personality could 
be distilled into their hair, but 
when we choose what color we 
want our hair to be, it’s safe to say 
it’s a very sentimental personal 
trademark of ours.

While hair has the utmost 

importance to queer people of all 
genders, it particularly stands out 
among queer men because it swims 
in a heterosexual sea of blasé male 
hair. I like to think people look at 
me (and boy, do I get looks now, 
good and bad) and see the person 
I want to present to the world, the 
self becomes more and more true 
every day. I hate to call my old hair 
boring, because I’ve seen beautiful 
brown hair, but I’ll be damned if 
blonds don’t have more fun.

Breanna Cross is an LSA 

Junior 
double 
majoring 
in 

Communications and Spanish. 
Originally 
from 
Southfield, 

Mich., Cross has been doing hair 
ever since she was a young girl. 
She loved the creative agency 
that braiding gave her in how 
she chose to present herself. 
Presently, Cross has made a 
name for herself as one of the 
key stylists specializing in Black 
hair and braiding on campus.

Smiling, Cross reflected on 

the success of her business, 
Bre Natural Beauty, and her 
love for Black hair. However, 
she remembered a time when 
vehement love for her hair didn’t 
exist, and she isn’t alone in her 
experience.

“When I grew up, starting 

when I was really young, I 
lived in a predominantly white 
neighborhood,” 
Cross 
said. 

“All of my friends had straight 
hair, my mom had straight hair, 
even the Disney princesses had 
straight hair. They were the only 
girls that had influence on me. I 
hated my hair and I wanted my 
hair to be long and flowy like 
everyone else.”

Due to white supremacy and 

Eurocentric beauty standards, 
Black women from a young age 
are conditioned to internalize 
negative attitudes about their 
hair 
texture. 
Messages 
of 

unkemptness, unattractiveness 
and unprofessionalism permeate 
descriptions of Black hair. To 
assimilate, many Black women 
resorted to straightening or 
covering their natural hair.

Since the mid-2000s, Black 

women around the world have 
become advocates of the Natural 
Hair Movement, a movement 
for Black women to celebrate 
and to indulge in the uniqueness 
that comes with having kinky-
curly hair. The natural hair 

movement is about more than 
hair; it’s a radical movement of 
self-love. It is is a movement to 
reclaim agency — to reclaim the 
lost love for yourself your hair, 
your roots, in a way that society 
historically has tried so hard to 

discourage.

Cross claimed that having a 

good relationship with your hair 
is crucial for its vitality. Through 
her business, she hopes to not 
only create a good hairstyle, but 
to also teach Black women how 
to healthily maintain, grow, 
treat and love their hair.

“If you don’t have a good 

relationship with your hair, 
you are going to do harmful 
things to it,” Cross explained. 
“It’s changing with the natural 
hair 
movement, 
thankfully. 

However, when I was younger, I 
didn’t know anything about my 
hair, and that’s why I hated it.”

The Natural Hair Movement 

is, in essence, a love story, and 
Cross’s work is a testament 
to the recovery process Black 
women around the globe are 
having with their hair. Styling 
hair gives Cross the agency to 
invest patience and care into 

Black hair, allowing her to fall 
in love with her own hair and to 
help others cultative that love 
for themselves.

“Some of the most rewarding 

things is being able to create 
relationships with my clients 
and to be able to constantly learn 
about different textures,” Cross 
continued. “Black hair is so 
amazing to me because you can 
do so many things with it, and 
everyone has a different texture. 
I love the people and I love 
learning more about Black hair.”

“I love talking to people and 

I love Black hair, and I love the 
Black community. That’s why I 
do what I do, and why I love it.”

Though Cross recognized the 

unique significance of hair for 
Black women, she warns about 
viewing Black hair as more than 
exactly that — hair. Just as some 
Black women choose to identify 
closely with their hair, Black 
women should also be afforded 
the same agency not to.

“I’m totally not attached to 

my hair. I would cut it off the 
next day with no worries,” she 
laughs.

Cross’s 
business 
is 
just 

beginning to pick up momentum, 
and she has no plans to stop any 
time soon.

In the future, she has plans 

to create a blog, a YouTube hair 
channel, natural hair workshops 
and natural hair organization. 
She 
also 
wants 
to 
expand 

her hair services to include 
custom wigs and clip-ins. Cross 
remains optimistic about her 
business, and she looks forward 
to learning more about herself 
and the community through the 
process.

“I can control my own destiny, 

and I can control what I want to 
do, or how, when and with who I 
want to do it with. I have choice.”

‘I Wore My Blackest Hair’

Katelyn Mulcahy / DAILY

TV NOTEBOOK

“I am a lion with a black mane, 

tearing my teeth on the piano 
bench,” writes Carlina Duan in 
the opening poem of her 2017 
collection “I Wore My Blackest 
Hair” (Little A, 2017). Her “black 
mane” is a site of contested cultural 
identity throughout the collection, 
both symbolically and literally. It is 
the part of her body she returns to 
when her identity is questioned — 
by others or by herself.

In “I Wore My Blackest Hair,” 

Duan, who is Chinese-American, 
grapples with the ways that her 

appearance shapes and is shaped 
by her evolving identity. Hair 
— whether hers or her family 
members’ — is where feelings of 
belonging and exclusion physically 
manifest. It is something concrete, 
both mutable and essential.

“The first time I was aware of 

my Asianness was when I asked 
my mother why I wasn’t blond,” 
wrote 
fashion 
writer 
Andrea 

Cheng in her April 2018 New York 
Times article on Asian-American 
women who bleach their hair. For 
Cheng, hair is as much a physical 
expression of who she is rather 
than who she is not.

“Of course, my story is not 

unique,” Cheng wrote. “It’s an 

experience that’s probably shared 
by most American-born Asians 
as we shake off our perceived 
otherness and strive to prove our 
Americanness.”

For Duan, this is certainly the 

case. Her hair is a mediator of her 
“Asianness,” a metric by which 
she and others gauge whether she 
embraces or rejects her heritage.

“My mother is not / from 

your country, / and I am not / 
ashamed,” writes Duan in “Pledge 
Allegiance.” “I slip my hands / 
through her / wise hair, / and 
keep.” Here, hair is a physical 
reminder 
of 
Duan’s 
mother’s 

culture, and it bridges the divide 
between them as Duan explores

Every sleepover I had from 

elementary to middle school 
ended the exact same way: 
snuggled up under a million 
blankets, popcorn in hand, 
“America’s Next Top Model” 
on the TV screen. As young 
girls, my friends and I were 
obsessed with the glamour 
of it all. Tyra Banks took 
ordinary girls and turned them 
into gorgeous, high-fashion 
women. When we were done 
watching — and fighting over 
our favorites — we would pull 
out our Justice-brand lipstick 
and hot pink brushes. Each of 
us tried to make ourselves into 
models, posing against white 
walls 
and 
taking 
pictures 

with disposable cameras. We 
wanted to be pretty, too.

Shows 
like 
“America’s 

Next Top Model” and “What 
Not To Wear” claim to be 
transformative. 
They 
say 

“come to us, change your look 
and your life will change, too.” 
It’s more than a wardrobe 
full of new clothes. These 
stylists stick these people in 
a chair, then chop off, dye 
and completely alter their 
hair. Hair can mean a lot to a 
person; it can be the place they 
express themselves, the only 
area of their body where they 
have full and utter control. 
Hair can show us where we 
came from, unifying families 
through a set of ginger heads 
or tight ringlets. But on these 
shows, watched by millions 
and continued season after 
season, your hair is what’s 
holding you back.

On “America’s Next Top 

Model,” the hairstyle was 
often what made a potential 
model’s makeover infamous. 
In the often toxic modeling 
industry, 
natural 
is 
never 

enough. Take Michelle on 
Season 4 of “Top Model.” She 
was a long-haired brunette, 
but her makeover consisted 
of bleaching her thick mane. 
Michelle was visibly in pain 
from how intense her dye job 

was, and struggled to keep 
it up throughout the season. 
The next season, contestant 
Cassandra Jean sobbed as 
her long locks were cut into 
a pixie cut à la Mia Farrow. 
While 
host 
Tyra 
Banks 

empathetically assured her it 
would grow back, comments 
from the judges and other 
contestants 
alike 
forced 

Cassandra into an upsetting 
position. 
As 
Cassandra 
is 

prepped for the cut, fellow 
model Ebony is quoted in a 
confessional saying, “It’s good 
to see Cassandra showing 
some emotion.” Shortly after, 
judge Jay Manuel complains, 
“It’s been 12 hours of crying.”

That’s not to say every 

transformation was negative. 
The show and its remodeling 
would not have lasted as long 
as it has if it was drenched 
in pure gloom. Bianca from 
Season 9 was meant to get a 
blonde wig, but her hair was 
too damaged to support it. So 
the team went with Plan B, 
and shaved it all off. While 
Bianca was initially upset, 
she embraced her natural look 
and the hairstyle transformed 
her into a regal, high-fashion 
face. The same goes with 
Kayla from Season 15, who had 
two rules from her girlfriend 
going in: No baldness and no 
red hair. The latter rule was, 
of course, broken, yet the hair 
color turned an otherwise 
ordinary girl into a unique 
modeling asset.

Compare 
the 
uncertain 

emotions 
of 
that 
series 

to 
today’s 
most 
popular 

transformation 
show, 

Netflix’s “Queer Eye,” and 
the difference is telling. Yes, 
“Queer Eye” is not preparing 
people 
for 
the 
cutthroat 

world of modeling, but a lot 
of the same elements of “Top 
Model” 
are 
there. 
Except 

instead 
of 
crying 
in 
the 

mirror as the hair you love is 
taken away from you, you’re 
laughing with perhaps the 
most optimistic and loveable 
force 
on 
television 
today: 

Jonathan Van Ness. Episode 
after 
episode, 
Jonathan 

doesn’t force a look on the 
people he styles; he talks to 
them, gets to know them and 
gives them whatever hair, 
beard or mustache revamp he 
knows will make them happy. 
Instead of crying tears of pain 
and sadness, people on “Queer 
Eye” cry tears of happiness, as 
they find their true potential 
and self while a chorus echoes 
“yes honey!” behind them.

As 
“Queer 
Eye” 
brings 

home 
three 
Emmys, 
the 

ratings of “America’s Next 
Top Model” have been on a 
steady decline. This may be 
a function of time and the 
fading novelty of “Top Model,” 
and the fact that “Queer 
Eye” has become something 
of a phenomenon. Yet the 
changing 
balance 
between 

the shows reveals something 
more 
about 
what 
viewers 

are looking for. “Queer Eye” 
radiates positivity, educating 
and exposing viewers and 
the cast alike to important 
issues like the relationship 
between the gay community 
and the church or the lives 
and struggles of transgender 
individuals. 
It 
is 
more 

than just a makeover show; 
“Queer Eye” is a snapshot of 
contemporary society in a 
vital stage of change. That 
change just happens to start 
with a few great haircuts.

People 
already 
feel 
bad 

enough about themselves. It’s 
only natural that one might 
want to turn to a more uplifting 
show than one whose appeal 
is based primarily in how 
dramatically it can change its 
contestants. Our hair is our 
own, and whether we change 
it should be left up to us. No 
one should be made to feel bad 
about something that came 
from their own body, that was 
formed by their own genes. As 
our TV shows change, I can 
only hope that our culture can 
too, and that somewhere there 
is a group of girls reaching for 
their hair brushes right now, 
smiling into the mirror and 
lifting up their friends with 
the 
ever-reassuring 
words: 

“YAS queen!”

More than just a haircut: 
strengths & shortcomings

her identity as an Asian-American 
woman. Duan’s desire to “keep” in 
these poems — to keep her heritage, 
her identity, her sense of self — is 
all the more captivating given the 
descriptions of earlier dismissals of 
Chinese culture.

“To replace the languages our 

mom spoke, we smoked up our 
Chinese with blond dolls,” she 
writes in “Little Sister, American 
Girl.” As a teenager and young 
adult, Duan’s relationship with her 
hair and appearance changes with 
her understanding of what it means 
to be a young Asian-American 
woman. This collection does not 
trace a linear path from repudiation 
to redemption, but instead tracks 
moments of both bewilderment 
and clarity, bestowing both with 
equal importance.

As 
she 
matures, 
Duan’s 

sexuality becomes inextricably 
tied 
to 
her 
Asian-American 

identity. 
She 
interrogates 
her 

own experiences of distance and 
intimacy with a keen awareness 
of the fraught territory mapped by 
her own desire.

“A boy plumps his lips on 

your throat / and asks you to say 
something dirty / in Chinese,” 
Duan writes in “Your Mom Tells 
You To Stop Writing About Race.” 
She does not stop writing about 
race, as her mother requests; 
instead: “you yank your hair / into 
a knot at the back of your neck” and 
doubles down on the subjects that 
preoccupy her.

Duan’s hair is where the 

line between recognition and 
fetishization 
becomes 
most 

apparent in her poetry. “he came 
over. asked, What are you?” Duan 
writes in “Here I Go, Torching.” 
“black plains of hair. / plain of 
mouth, of meat… I’m Chinese; see 
me,” she continues.

She yearns to be recognized as 

more than just her heritage without 

being stripped of it. Hair becomes a 
bridge to the things she wants but 
does not know how to ask for. “I 
want you to untouch my hair,” she 
says in “I Want My Books Back,” 
mourning the parts of herself she 
shared and cannot regain.

Throughout 
the 
collection, 

Duan commits and recommits 
herself to her world. She is not 
trying to escape anything — she 
revels in the tangible, the terrible, 
the mundane. Her hair is all of 
these things; it unmasks her when 
she wants to be hidden and hides 
her when she wants to be seen. She 
alternates between introspective 
and hostile, giving herself room 
to collect evidence of her own 
contradictory 
nature. 
In 
the 

marrow of each poem lies Duan’s 
abiding appreciation: for herself, 
for her family, for how the process 
of understanding her heritage has 
both taken from her and made her 
whole.

Bangs are a telltale sign that 

something is wrong. Nobody just 
wakes up one morning and thinks, 
“I should get bangs today.” No, 
bangs are premeditated. They 
take planning and plotting and 
panicking. And when judgment day 
comes, the verdict is most definitely 
going to be guilty.

I have spent hours — nay, nights 

— searching through the depths of 
Pinterest for the perfect bangs. My 
research has shed light on the fact 
that each face shape is conducive to 
a different style of bang. Therefore, 
to select your most bangable bangs, 
you must first identify the shape of 
your face. The problem is that my 
face increases in circumference 
proportionally to the amount of 
MSG, carbs and alcohol I consume 
in any given week. But bangs are 
forever. Or, at least until they grow 
into side bangs that — like froyo, 
shrugs and Victoria Secret lip-gloss 
— should stay in the mid-2000s. 

And yet, there comes a time 

when you find yourself thinking 
about getting bangs at 2:00 in the 
morning. You Google messy bangs, 
Reese Witherspoon bangs, bangs 
that will draw attention away 
from your chin. You’re frantically 

pinning, pinning, pinning … until 
the melatonin kicks in.

There will inevitably come a 

time when you ask your friends, 
“Should I get bangs?” If they are 
good friends, loyal friends, they 
will tell you “NO!” with the fury 
of a hundred monsoons. If they 
are liars, they will lie and say you 
are someone who can totally pull 
them off. Let me be clear: Bangs 
have only ever looked unspeakably 
fantastic on Julian Casablancas, but 
that’s a different story entirely.

Bangs are, really, a cry for help. 

So, I have created this choose-
your-own-adventure to help a lost, 
bang-ridden soul in need. Also, I 
overheard a girl telling her friend 
she “like, literally, can’t stop doing 
Buzzfeed quizzes” and all I have to 
say to that is: I aim to please.

If you’re the poster child for 

unrequited love, you should get: 
Side-swept bangs

I’ve 
always 
been 
an 
avid 

supporter of break-up hair. Your 
boyfriend cheated on you and 
smashed your gullible heart into 
a million shards of damage? Go 
blonde! Who cares if your hair no 
longer matches your eyebrows. But 
what if you didn’t have a boyfriend 
to cheat on you in the first place? If 
your particular brand of low self-
esteem stems from years of getting 
the short end of the unrequited love 

stick, side-swept bangs are here to 
say “loneliness” so you don’t have 
to. 

If you have no direction in 

life, are broke and have a liberal 
arts degree, you should get: Long 
bangs

You’re trying to be someone 

you’re not. Your bangs looked OK 
for a total of two seconds just after 
they were professionally styled, 
and in that moment you vowed 
to make them look whimsical 
every goddamn morning. You 
even purchased a round brush. 
But, honey, you will never have 
the patience to style your bangs. 
Not ever. You will not get the right 
products, or blow-dry them when 
they are just the right level of 
dampness. They will (dare I say) air 
dry, and they will not look good. But, 
you chose to major in English, and 
think you can adapt to whatever 
challenges come your way. Let’s 
hope you’re Zooey Deschanel.

If you fear you are not 

interesting, you should get: Baby 
bangs

You hopped on the manic-pixie-

whatever train and haven’t quite 
been able to hop off. Sure, you’re 
a feminist, but it’s 2018 and that 
should be the bare minimum. Your 
quirkiness has run its course and 
you fear that you may be, simply, 
boring. In the Voltaire vs. hair 

debate (See “The Princess Diaries” 
if you are drawing a blank on this 
particular witty reference), you’d 
rather pin bangs ceaselessly into 
the night. So, you sign up for a 
class. You try finger painting so you 
can tell people that you do finger 
painting, but you really, really hate 
finger-painting. Then you take 
a wine seminar, but realistically 
there is no way you can afford such 
a bourgeois hobby. You could be 
interesting, you think, if you had 
the funds. Having interests is so 
expensive these days. Good thing 
narcissism is in.

If you push people away and 

need an emotional laxative, 
you should get: Blunt, straight-
across bangs

I am the most worried about you. 

Especially if you have curly hair, 
but choose to straighten just your 
bangs. This eludes to Christopher 
Nolan 
level 
psychological 

labyrinths à la “Inception” that not 
even the cutest version of Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt can lead you out of. 
Blunt bangs are just the first line of 
defense into the emotional turmoil 
that you keep locked away. The key 
lies in pinning those babies back. 

If 
you 
can’t 
commit 
to 

anything, not even bangs, you 
should get: Parted Bangs

Get parted bangs, and not a 

tattoo.

I used to hate my Jewfro.
As is the case with most 

curly-haired 
Jewish 
people, 

I would often fantasize about 
what my hair would like like 
if it were short, slick and 
straight, 
something 
akin 
to 

Alex Turner’s high pompadour 
or Brad Pitt’s undercut or even 
Adam Levine’s relaxed waves. 
I’ve even considered altering 
the color of my hair and shaving 
it off completely. The specific 
tightness and thickness of my 
curls make it difficult to get a 
haircut that wasn’t just “long 
on the top, short on the sides.” 
It didn’t help either that, along 
with my last name and the shape 
of my nose, the style of my hair 
made my Jewishness stick out 
like a sore thumb.

This, of course, is not to say 

that I’m ashamed of my Jewish 
heritage (far from it). But like 
anyone who comes from a 
marginalized 
background, 
I 

had trouble reconciling with 
the inextricable tie between 
my identity as a Jew and the 
hair on my head. Even though 
I was surrounded by a Jewish 
community for the majority 
of my life, my hair was still a 
constant reminder that I was 
different.

Jewish or not, big, kinky and 

dark hair is something that has 
always been seen as an aesthetic 
accessory needing to be tamed 
in order to heed the societal 
standard of short, straight and 

light hair. In the more specific 
context of the Jewfro, the 
unkemptness of curly Jewish 
hair on men can often be seen as 
unattractive, asexual, awkward 
and out-of-fashion.

Famous 
Jewish 
male 

celebrities like Jonah Hill, Seth 
Rogen, Jesse Eisenberg and Andy 
Samberg helped popularize the 
Jewfro early in their careers, 
but have long since abandoned 
those 
hairstyles 
for 
more 

refined ‘dos. TV characters who 
sported Jewfros — like Robbie 
Shapiro (Matt Bennett, “Grey’s 
Anatomy”), the geeky puppeteer 
from Nickelodeon’s “Victorious,” 
and Kevin (David Bloom, “CSI: 
NY”), the lonely pre-teen from 
Netflix’s “Wet Hot American 
Summer: First Day of Camp” — 
were usually the butt of the joke 
or simply comic relief, which 
inevitably reinforces negative, 
stereotypical representations of 
Jewish masculinity.

For me, the Jewfro represents 

a paradox of pride and shame. 
My parents, sister and I all 
share curly hair, though each of 
us possess different textures: 
My sister’s is bouncy, my mom’s 
is flowy and my dad’s is rigid 
(though it was radically bulkier 
in the ’70s, which resulted in him 
getting the nickname “Poodle”). 
Hair is one of the few traits that 
my family and I can appreciate 
sharing together, but growing 
up, that didn’t always feel like 
enough.

Whenever my hair grew long, 

I brushed it for what felt like 
hours, trying to get rid of the 
knots and cowlicks that refused 

to be subdued. Trips to the 
barbershop made for both an 
exciting and anxiety-inducing 
experience. On rare occasions, 
they were humiliating, like when 
my mother coerced me into 
getting a haircut one day after 
school in sixth grade when she 
saw it was getting too big. As I 
sat weeping in that chair in the 
Yellow Balloon Barbershop while 
my barber ran her coarse fingers 
through my hair, all I could think 
about was how I was missing 
out on playing Guitar Hero and 
eating popcorn with the boys 
who were in my carpool. My hair 
had quite literally inhibited me 
from socializing.

Moments like those deepened 

my embarrassment for having a 
Jewfro. After ninth grade, I kept 
my hair mostly on the short side 
and made sure to get a haircut at 
the beginning of every month. 
Before embarking on a six-week 
summer program in Israel in 
2013, I asked my parents to give 
me a buzzcut, since it was a 
trendy look among my friends 
at the time. Unfortunately, their 
attempt at shaving my hair with 
the incorrect set of clippers in 
my backyard led to the worst 
haircut I’ve ever received (sorry, 
Mom and Dad). The flattened 
strands, which were later fixed 
by a professional barber, made 
my hair lose its curly quality, 
causing me to briefly consider 
that perhaps a shaved look was 
not the best idea in the first place.

In other instances, my Jewfro 

became 
a 
source 
of 
actual 

physical agony. At my first ever 
“Rocky Horror Picture Show” 

midnight 
screening 
in 
the 

summer of 2015, a young woman 
yanked my hair and proceeded to 
violently rock it back and forth 
during what’s known as the 
“Virginal Sacrifice,” an initiation 
in 
which 
“Rocky 
Horror” 

first-timers are subjected to 
aggressive 
dry-humping 
by 

a crowd of “Rocky Horror” 
veterans. After it happened and 
my initial mortification subsided, 
I tried to laugh the whole thing 
off, thinking that the more 
important thing was to just 
have fun. But I couldn’t shake 
off how much her grabbing my 
hair hurt, how painful it was to 
have something so integral to my 
identity be violated for the sake

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: 
MACHINE GUN KELLY’S 

‘LATELY’ IS A TOTAL 

BORE

“LATELY”

Machine Gun 

Kelly

Interscope 

Records

INTERSCOPE RECORDS

In his recent video for 

“LATELY,” from new EP 
Binge, Machine Gun Kelly 
certainly seems to stay 
on his narcissistic brand. 
Once 
having 
watched 

him scream at a small 
audience during a panel 
about how he is possibly 
the most underrated hip-
hop artist of all time, the 
song and video’s self-
reflexive nature comes as 
no surprise.

From the get-go, MGK 

makes a nod towards his 
own creative inputs with 
a title shot that states 
“Shot by Machine Gun 
Kelly.” 
What 
proceeds 

is a tripped-out fever 
dream with most of the 
shots being entirely of 
his own face. It’s a rather 
repetitive formula: close 
up, extreme close up, 
cigarette/blunt, 
wine, 

repeat. There seems to 
be little else left for MGK 
to focus on when he’s 

“having crazy thoughts.”

And 
MGK’s 
shot 

choices seem to be just as 
crazy as these thoughts; 
chaotic handheld camera 
movements contribute to 
the viewers’ inevitable 
disorientation, mirrored 
in his manic, disjointed 
lyricism. 
He 
switches 

topics 
from 
being 

abandoned as a kid to 
treating women poorly 
within the span of a few 
lines before making his 
return to the banal chorus 
— what MGK often lacks 
in originality, he makes 
up for in aggression.

Frankly, if you aren’t a 

fan of MGK’s face or some 
good, old-fashioned drug 
use, there’s really nothing 
else to see here. The 
video content is almost 
more minimalistic than 
the 
songwriting 
itself, 

leading 
to 
inevitable 

boredom 
within 
the 

first minute or two of 
the track. He closes his 
choruses with “And you 
know I’m tryna change, 
but it’s very hard,” which 
couldn’t be more obvious 
with such static material.

of spectacle.

As time has passed, I’ve 

started to embrace the Jewfro 
look a bit more. I’ve realized 
that cutting my Jewfro was both 
flattening my hair into a more 
neutral appearance and erasing 
an important facet of my Jewish 
identity. Based on the suggestion 
of a barber I met in New York 
this summer, I bought American 
Crew forming cream to help 
volumize and brighten my curls, 
and since that purchase, my 
insecurity over my curls has 
lessened dramatically. A friend 
recently told me, after seeing a 
picture of me on my Instagram 
story, that my hair looks better 
when it’s longer. I mentioned 

that I was thinking about cutting 
it soon, which was followed by 
a message of three eye-rolling 
emojis. Maybe he’s right.

So often we are told to 

suppress who we are in order 
to appease the expectations of 
others or to change ourselves 
in order to stand out among 
the masses, and these primal 
fears can be traced through our 
need to cut or alter our hair and 
other parts of ourselves. I used 
to think that my Jewfro made 
it harder for me to navigate the 
straight-haired world, but the 
more I’ve learned to appreciate 
it, the more I understand why it’s 
necessary to who I am and who I 
am becoming.

2-BSide

Our culture is one saturated 

by 
antiquated, 
sexist 
and 

Eurocentric 
perceptions 
of 

female 
beauty. 
Intertwined 

with this conception of physical 
perfection 
is 
hair, 
more 

specifically straight hair, which 
has 
prompted 

generations 
of 

African-American 
women 
to 
alter 

their 
unique 

frizz 
and 
curl 

patterns 
to 
fit 

the mold of silky locks. With its 
well-constructed 
protagonist, 

engaging character relationships 
and 
profound, 
relevant 

reflections about skewed societal 
guidelines for beauty, “Nappily 
Ever After” simply cannot be 
passed off as just another chick-
flick, even though it abides by 
many of the rom-com genre 
conventions.

When Violet (Sanaa Lathan, 

“Love & Basketball”) was a little 
girl, she quickly learned that 
the only path to perfection was 
through straight hair. And she 
never forgot it. As an adult with 
a thriving career, a doting and 
sexy boyfriend and long, relaxed 
hair, Violet’s life is nothing short 
of perfect. However, when an 
eagerly 
anticipated 
proposal 

from her hunky beau Clint (Ricky 
Whittle, “Austenland”) turns out 
to be a false alarm and leads to a 
messy breakup, rainclouds begin 
to form over Violet’s flawless and 
straight-laced world. Struggling 
to get back into the dating pool 
and navigate lingering feelings 
for her ex, Violet, in a drunken 
craze, 
makes 
a 
hasty 
and 

emotionally-charged decision to 
shave her head. At first regretful 
of her rash choice, Violet’s 
definition of beauty begins to 
re-shape itself when a trip to the 
salon to salvage her hair-troubles 
leads to an unexpected friendship 
with the sassy yet sweet Zoe 

(Daria Johns, “Animator”) and 
a tentative romance with Zoe’s 
down-to-earth father Will (Lyriq 
Bent, “She’s Gotta Have It”).

Part of what allows “Nappily 

Ever After” to find success is its 
ability to balance heftier topics 
with lighthearted moments. At 
the surface level, Violet’s search 
for “the right man” can be passed 
off as akin to any female lead’s 

journey to love in 
any other romantic 
film. 
However, 

what sets “Nappily 
Ever After” apart 
is its dissection of 
the impact of the 

male gaze on women’s choices 
regarding 
their 
appearances. 

All her life, Violet was taught, 
both by the beauty industry 
and her mother, that men only 
want women with long, flowing 
tresses, not afros and dreadlocks. 
Thus, she styled her hair straight, 
altering herself with the end 
goal of presenting herself the 
way she thought men found 
desirable. Through her dramatic 
hair transformation and healthy, 
blossoming 
relationship 
with 

Will, Violet finally starts to 
grasp the notion that a real man, 
or at least any 
man worth her 
time, 
will 
see 

her for who she 
is, 
regardless 

of what does or 
doesn’t grow out 
of her head.

Violet’s 

transformation 
by the end of the 
film is clear. Once 
insecure 
about 

her natural hair 
and 
allegiant 

to the flat iron, 
Violet is no longer 
the same woman 
by the end of the 
film. For so many 
years, water was 
Violet’s 
enemy, 

as 
it 
had 
the 

power 
to 
ruin 

her painstakingly 
pressed locks within seconds. 
Newly 
empowered 
and 
unchained 

from anyone’s standards, Violet 
lets it all go through her symbolic 
leap into a swimming pool, 

literally drowning out years of 
lies that she has been told about 

her frizz, her 
curls 
and 

her 
texture 

not 
being 

beautiful 
enough.

On 
its 

own, straight 
hair isn’t the 
problem. As is 
emphasized 
in the final 
moments 
of 

the film, it 
is 
not 
that 

women 
should 
feel 

guilty 
or 

wrong 
for 

wanting 
to 

switch 
up 

their natural 
hair, 
but 

rather 
that 

all 
women 

should feel confident in their 
choices to alter their looks with 
the knowledge that they are 
worthy of love and respect no 
matter what.

I have frizzy hair. This is an 

indisputable fact.

My 
hair 
best 
resembles 

a 
bush 
of 
black 
ringlets 

springing 
from 
different 

angles across my head. The 
strands in the front are shorter 
and bounce up if you give them 
a quick tug at the ends. When 
I reach behind my head I feel a 
mass of uneven curls; the tips 
are frayed even after a recent 
haircut and the outer layers 
are always softer than the 
inner sheets. I 
envy those that 
can run their 
fingers through 
their hair and 
change 
their 

part in seconds, 
because 
mine 

just 
doesn’t 

move like that.

I 
love 
my 

chaotic 
hair 

to 
death. 
But 

there’s 
one 

issue. My whole 
life, I’ve been 
told that it needs 
to be tamed.

I’m 

standing 
by 

the entrance to 
the 
bathroom, 

watching 
my 

grandmother 
plait her waist-
long 
hair 
in 

front 
of 
the 

mirror. 
Her 

red and white 
sari is loosely 
wrapped around 
her frame and 
gold 
bangles 

jangle 
against 

her wrists with 
each movement 
of her delicate 
fingers. The rich 
smell of coconut 
oil saturates the 
air; 
the 
scent 

irritates 
my 

seven-year-old 
nostrils 
and 

I take a step 
backwards. 
Finishing 
her 

braid, my grandmother dumps 
some coconut oil into her 
hands, rubs them together and 
makes a beeline for my head. I 
scream.

That 
dreadful 
summer 

afternoon was my earliest 
notion that something wasn’t 
right with my hair. Many 
Indian women have similar 
frizzy hair types, but their 
locks are always oiled and 
braided, 
tied 
up 
instead 

of 
bouncing 
against 
their 

backs. Short hair is seen as 
unfeminine. 
The 
strands 

frame their faces, not cover it 
like mine. The picture of the 
happy woman plastered on the 
front of the coconut oil bottle 
is clear in my head: Her hair is 
soft, silky and oiled. This was 
the ideal, and I didn’t fit the 
norm.

Part of this standard for 

female hair is perpetuated by 
Bollywood, an industry that 

capitalizes on rigid gender 
stereotypes. I have yet to see a 
Bollywood heroine that wears 
her hair like mine — curly and 
loose. Silky and straight hair 
isn’t realistic for the majority 
of Indian women. But because 
of Bollywood, it’s what every 
Indian woman aspires to have.

Spring 
2012: 
My 
clash 

with hair standards reached 
their height in Kathak, a type 
of Indian classical dance I 
pursued in my pre-teen and 
teen years. Typical Kathak 
dancers tie their hair up in 
a bun and decorate it with 
jasmine flowers. Their hair 

is pushed aside 
to 
display 

their 
face, 

accentuated 
with a tikli — 
an 
ornament 

resting 
on 

the top of the 
forehead. 
A 

deep red bindi 
is pressed onto 
the forehead for 
the same effect. 
When I tied my 
hair for Kathak 
dance 
recitals, 

gravity-defying 
strands 
of 

hair 
shot 
up 

at the root of 
the 
bun 
and 

near my ears. 
It looked like 
a lion’s mane, 
an 
obvious 

anomaly 
on 

stage. 
My 

teacher 
and 

fellow 
dance 

students 
had 

effortlessly 
neat 
buns 
on 

their 
heads. 

When I looked 
in the mirror 
minutes before 
showtime, 
I 

forced 
myself 

to 
ignore 
my 

hair and focus 
on the rest of 
my appearance 
instead. But the 
shame 
burned 

at the pit of 
my 
stomach, 

a 
constant 
reminder 
as 

I 
performed 
that 
I 
was 

different.

Years later, I’ve realized 

why my culture’s ideas about 
hair never fit my own. I chose 
to keep my hair down all 
those years because my hair 
was an integral part of my 
personality; it typefied my 
energetic and happy persona. 
I didn’t mind the frizz, even 
though society had always 
told me to tuck it away. Hiding 
my hair made me feel naked, 
as if I was missing a part of 
who I was.

I haven’t been near coconut 

oil in years. I wear my hair 
the way I like it: always loose, 
always frizzy, but always me. 
I still don’t understand the 
antipathy to frizzy hair I see 
when walking the streets. 
What’s wrong with frizzy? 
Frizzy 
is 
different 
and 

diverse, fun and sassy. And it’s 
beautiful.

A case for frizz

NOTEBOOK

Roughly a year ago, rapper 

Young Thug was charged 
with eight major felonies, 
including intent to distribute 
methamphetamine 
and 

hydrocodone. This headline 
came and went, and the 
Atlanta star seemed to be in 
the clear. Two weeks ago, 
while on tour with J. Cole, 
Thug posted an Instagram 
picture of a notecard that 
read, “On The Rvn,” implying 
a 
soon-to-come 
anti-

authority album and bringing 
to the surface his legal issues. 
Just days later, he turned 
himself in to the authorities, 
delaying the release of the EP.

Now released on bail, Thug 

finally dropped the project. 
The 6-track EP is limited 
in features and primarily 
showcases 
beats 
from 

London On Da Track, the 
same formula used for Thug’s 

most 
impressive 
mixtape, 

Slime Season 3. After the 
release 
of 
the 
mediocre 

full-length 
album, 
Slime 

Language, which seemed to 
reflect a regression in the 

rapper’s ability, On The Rvn 
is a redeeming return to what 
works.

Unlike on Slime Language, 

Thug is not fighting for space 
with featured artists who 
sound just like him; the only 
guests are 6lack and Jaden 

Smith, and their contributions 
are limited and very well-
suited. Additionally, London 
On Da Track’s beats make 
the project an easier listen 
overall, 
as 
he 
provides 

dynamic sounds that stray 
from the hackneyed trap of 
Slime Language.

To cap it all off, the EP ends 

with an official release of 
Young Thug’s remix of Elton 
John’s “Rocket Man,” a track 
that has bounced around 
SoundCloud for a few years. 
With a gorgeous falsetto that 
slides to trembling baritone, 
Thugger reminds listeners 
why he is one of the most 
innovative 
rappers 
alive, 

an 
important 
move 
after 

his prior release left fans 
doubting his relevance.
