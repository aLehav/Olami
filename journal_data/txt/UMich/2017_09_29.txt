Four 
students 
have 
been 

selected by the University of 
Michigan to be official nominees 
for the prestigious Rhodes and 
Marshall 
scholarships, 
which 

provide full funding for graduate 
study in the United Kingdom. 

This years nominees include 

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Nadine 

Jawad, recent LSA alum Jonathan 
Williams, University alum Yiran 
Liu and University alum Lauren 
Shepard. 

According to the LSA Office 

of 
National 
Scholarships 

and Fellowships the Rhodes 
Scholarship, 
which 
was 

established in 1902, covers 2 to 3 
years of post-bachelor’s education 
at the University of Oxford. Thirty-
two scholars from the United 
States are selected each year, and 
25 University of Michigan alumni 
have received the scholarship 
since its conception, including 
Abdul El-Sayed, current 2018 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
for 

Michigan.

The 
Marshall 
Scholarship, 

on the other hand, covers one to 
two years of graduate study at 
a wide variety of U.K. academic 
institutions 
including 
Oxford, 

Cambridge, the London School 
of Economics and others. Up to 
40 scholars are selected each 
year based on academic merit, 
leadership 
and 
ambassadorial 

potential, Marshall’s main three 
criteria for recipients.

ONSF Director Henry Dyson, 

who worked very closely with 
the four nominees during the 
application and selection process, 
said 
these 
two 
scholarships 

represent 
the 
pinnacle 
of 

academic funding in the U.K.

“As I always say, (Rhodes and 

Marshall) are like the Rose Bowl 
of (U.K. scholarships),” Dyson 
said. “There’s an emphasis on 
leadership and cosmopolitanism 
and well-roundedness and service 
that’s built into the Rhodes and 
Marshall scholarships.”

For Jawad, vice president of 

Central Student Government, the 
nomination for both Rhodes and 
Marshall scholarships reinforces 
her commitment to migrant 

and refugee studies from an 
international health viewpoint. A 
first-generation student and the 
daughter of a Lebanese refugee, 
Jawad said she heard a lot from 
her family growing up about what 
life is like as a refugee. However, 
she said she wanted to look at the 
issue in a more academic setting 
through graduate work.

Jawad was also named the 

27th University student to win 
the Truman Scholarship, a public 
service award for third-year 
students last year. She said while 
the rigor and intensity of the 
application process for Rhodes 
and Marshall was similar to 
Truman, being awarded the 

nomination 
for 
Rhodes 
and 

Marshall after Truman was a 
great honor.

“I was still very shocked that 

they chose to nominate me for 
both (Rhodes and Marshall), but 
it was a little bit different because 
this time around, I felt so much 
emotion and appreciation for 
the people who believed in me 
because a lot of people are like 
‘Oh you already have one. Why 
would you want to apply for 
another?’ but I think that people 
who nominated me recognize 
that they’re two very different 
opportunities so I’m just very 
humbled and honestly grateful for 
the people who chose to nominate 

Hillary 
Clinton, 
former 

Democratic 
presidential 

nominee and former Secretary 
of State, will take her book tour 
to the University of Michigan’s 
Hill Auditorium Oct. 24 –– and 
a multitude of opinions, fans and 
critics await her.

As the Democratic presidential 

nominee, Clinton proved to be an 
incendiary figure, and her book is 
creating a similar buzz. Clinton’s 
publishers said the book, titled 
“What 
Happened,” 
outlines 

the “rage, sexism, exhilarating 
highs 
and 
infuriating 
lows” 

accompanying her journey as the 
first female nominee of a major 
presidential party.

But some University students 

aren’t 
interested 
in 
“What 

Happened,” 
and 
question 

Clinton’s motives for offering a 
retrospective look into her loss. A 
Facebook event titled “Bring your 
pony to Hillary’s salty book tour” 
indicates 
some 
perspectives 

students have of the event.

LSA junior Meaghan Wheat 

agreed, and said despite her 
support 
for 
Clinton

In March 2017, University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

announced the University of 
Michigan’s 
development 
of 

Teach-Outs, an educational series 
covering a broad range of current 
topics that can be accessed for free 
through digital platforms, edX 
and Coursera. After the series’ 
first several months, the first 
five Teach-Outs have engaged 
participants from all over the 
world.

The current series pays homage 

to 
the 
University’s 
Teach-In 

Series held in 1965 as a response to 
the Vietnam War. Professors held 
teach-ins to encourage students 
to form educated responses to the 
rapidly changing political climate. 
Fifty years later, the University 
has revamped the series to be a 
Teach-Out, where professors have 
discussions through online edX 
courses, or massive open online 
courses, in order for the program 
to reach a global audience.

According to James Hilton, 

dean of libraries and vice provost 
of academic innovation, the series 
has successfully met its goal of 
not only engaging the students at 
the University, but also gaining 
different perspectives from the 
broader public.

“The 
Teach-Outs 
released 

thus far on edX: ‘Democratic 
to Authoritarian Rule,’ ‘Fake 
News,’ ‘Stand Up for Science’ and 
‘The Future of Obamacare’; on 
Coursera: ‘Hurricanes: What’s 
Next?’ have included participants 
from over 130 countries,” Hilton 
said. “The first Teach-Outs have 
begun to tap the power of global 
conversation.”

Students have also contributed 

to creating content for the Teach-
Outs and sharing their growing 
understanding of these issues 
with the greater community, 
according to Hilton.

“In the current Hurricanes 

Teach-Out, students in Professor 
Samson’s 
Extreme 
Weather 

course contributed questions for 
extreme weather experts, and 
they also helped research and 
respond to participants’ questions

The Vice President stopped in Auburn Hills to promote tax code simplification

Vice President Mike Pence 

pitched his party’s tax reform 
plan as “the largest tax cut in 
American history” to about 300 
Michigan residents and business 
owners at an American Axle and 
Manufacturing facility in Auburn 
Hills Thursday afternoon.

Pence and other members 

of 
Republican 
leadership 

are 
underlining 
three 
major 

provisions: simplification of the 

tax code, tax cuts for the middle 
class and tax cuts for businesses.

There is significant pressure 

on President Donald Trump and 
the Republican Party to pass 
tax reform quickly. In the wake 
of another failed attempt at 
repealing Obamacare –– one of 
the GOP’s main promises to its 
base –– Republicans are eager to 
claim a major victory before the 
2018 congressional elections.

“While health care is gonna 

take a little bit more time, I’m 
happy to tell you that help is on the 
way right now because, under the 

leadership of President Donald 
Trump, we’re gonna cut taxes 
across the board,” Pence said. 
“With the support of Michigan’s 
leaders in Congress and the 
support of President Trump, I say 
with confidence: Before we get 
to Christmas of this year, we’re 
gonna pass the largest tax cut in 
American history.”

The 
issue 
of 
tax 
cuts 

consistently 
plays 
well 
with 

Trump’s base. Diane Schindlbeck, 
co-chair of the Michigan Trump 
Republicans, said it was one of the 
issues most important to her.

“That is actually one of the 

first reasons why I actually got on 
board with Trump was because of 
what’s going on with our taxes,” 
she said. “As Pence said today, 
the simplicity of it –– it is very, 
very confusing and we do need 
to be able to put money back into 
the working man’s pocket. It is so 
hard for small businesses right 
now because of the high taxes that 
they have to pay.”

Pence implored the audience 

to also put pressure on the state’s 
Democratic lawmakers, saying

Student health may suffer from 

the return of beer and attendant 

intemperate drinking, according to 

a statement issued yesterday by Dr. 

Warren E. Forsythe, director of the 

University Health Service. 

Automobile accidents and bodily 

and mental deterioration are predicted 

for intemperate students by the 

statement which follows:

“One hesitates to say that any 

alcoholic drink is compatible with 

health. Certainly such drinking has 

no health values but injury depends 

upon many variable circumstances. 

In common sense observations it is 

difficult to demonstrate harm from 

temperate use of beverages of low 

alcoholic content but the pathologist 

sees harmful tissue changes 

attributable to prolonged and probably

immoderate drinking of beer. 

Any increase of drinking raises many 

questions of student welfare. Whatever 

may be said in favor of temperate 

drinking, no one can well deny that 

intemperance is harmful to the drinker 

and society generally. Because of 

the physiological effects of alcohol 

and the circumstances under which 

students used to drink, the line between 

temperance and intemperance is a 

difficult one to determine or maintain. 

The return of legal and cheaper beer 

will be a challenge to the good sense 

and self-control of our students. From 

past observations and a knowledge 

of the physiological action of alcohol 

one cannot help but fear that student 

health is going to be injured in several 

ways if drinking increases. An increase 

of physical injuries from automobile 

accidents and an increase of venereal 

infections are particular hazards 

resulting from over drinking.

“It is a nice question as to whether 

or not medical service which is supplied 

upon a co-operative social basis for any 

group should be available for illness and 

injuries resulting from alcoholism.

FRIDAY’S BICENTENNIAL FEATURE: INTEMPERATE BEER-DRINKING 
IS DECLARED HARMFUL TO HEALTH

Civil rights workers discuss history 
of discrimination in Ann Arbor

Community members discussed past and present segregation in Detroit and A2

Thursday 
night, 
about 
70 

students and members of the Ann 
Arbor community gathered in the 
Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library 
to listen to 1960s civil rights 
workers discuss past and present 
segregation in Detroit and Ann 
Arbor. The event focused on how 
the 1967 Detroit riots in Ann Arbor 
and the impact they had on the 
segregation present in Ann Arbor 
at the time. The event was held in 
tandem with the Reverberations 
of Rebellion exhibit currently on 
display in the library to better 
explain this connection.

The discussion was organized by 

Taubman student Joel Batterman 
to help commemorate the 50th 
anniversary of the Detroit riots of 
1967. Batterman, a Ph.D. candidate, 
designed the discussion to explain 
the history of segregation in Ann 

Arbor — something he believes 
a large number of people do not 
understand.

“Because a lot of people don’t 

know about that,” Batterman said. 
“They don’t know the history of 
segregation and inequality in Ann 
Arbor or of the efforts to fight it.”

To help explain this history, 

Batterman worked to gather the 
leaders of the civil rights movement 
in Ann Arbor together to explain 
the important work they had led 
in the fight for equality. The panel 
included Shirley Beckley, Walter 
“Trey” Greene, Anna Holden and 
Alma Wheeler Smith, who all 
worked on desegregation efforts in 
the 1960s and ’70s.

Moderated by History professor 

Matt Lassiter, the panel opened 
with statements by each panelist on 
their personal histories in the civil 
rights movement and moved to 
discussions of segregation in Ann 
Arbor.

Shirley Beckley, a former staff 

member on the Ann Arbor Human 
Relations Commission, spoke about 
growing up in segregated Ann 
Arbor and what being Black meant 
at that time.

“The other thing was that we 

had certain places we could go 
and certain places on Main Street 
that we weren’t allowed to go in 
to different restaurants here,” 
Beckley said.

She 
also 
described 
the 

experience of being forced to sit 
in the balcony of the Michigan 
Theater and the State Theater, as 
Black patrons were not permitted 
to sit close to the front.

After Beckley concluded her 

remarks, former state Rep. Alma 
Wheeler Smith spoke on housing 
segregation in Ann Arbor.

“Ann Arbor, in many respects, 

was as bad as the South,” Wheeler 
Smith said. “It was just not done by 
law, it was done by agreements and 
codes and boundaries.”

Wheeler Smith, the daughter of 

Albert Wheeler, the first Black 
mayor of Ann Arbor and the first 
tenured Black professor at the 
University of Michigan, went on 
to discuss the segregation that 
existed within the University at 
the time.

“The University itself was 

a very segregated place,” she 
said. “We had a population in 
the late ’50s, early ’60s, when 
I was coming into a college of 
about 3 percent Black, and we 
had one Black faculty member 
at the medical school.”

The final two panelists, Anna 

Holden and Trey Greene, spoke 
on civil rights-oriented student 
organizations on campus in the 
1960s. Holden helped lead and 
found the Ann Arbor Congress 
of 
Racial 
Equality. 
Along 

with the NAACP and other 
organizations, she led protests 
against segregated housing to 
the Ann Arbor City Council and 
was eventually arrested for her 
activism.

election, she doesn’t see what 
productivity this book offers.

“I’d like to focus on what 

we can do now to build policy 
and build advocacy for certain 
groups,” she said.

Though the cost of the book 

and tour concerns some — pre-
sale tickets for the Ann Arbor 
event are currently around $82 
to $170 range — many point out 
nearly every recent president has 
sold a book and gone on a pricey 
tour. Wheat said many politicians, 
including Joe Biden, who will visit 
the University on his book tour in 
December, offer pricey books, but 
those books usually have some 
kind of advocacy or goal involved. 
She said this seems to be lacking 
from Clinton’s book.

“A lot of people, after losing 

the presidency, go through a lot 
of public service campaigns, like 
Al Gore and environmentalism,” 
Wheat said. “Her book seems to 
be just about her side of campaign 
events. 
That’s 
definitely 

worthwhile reading but at the 
same time, with the current 
political atmosphere, I want to 
know what’s the bigger point, 
what’s the bigger issue, whether 
it be humanitarian or anything.”

LSA 
junior 
Jim 
Stehlin, 

however, sees politicians’ book 
tours as problematic for our 
country’s interests in general. 
Rather than focusing on policy, 
Stehlin said the “hero-worship” of 

politicians makes us focus on how 
politicians function as celebrities 
(Biden’s ice cream habit, or 
Obama’s humor, for example), 
rather than how they functioned 
as public servants.

“I find myself consistently 

disappointed 
by 
the 
hero-

worship within the Democratic 
Party because it distracts from 
the policy issues that actually 
affect people’s lives,” Stehlin 
said. “Former presidents often do 
release books, (but) Hillary was 
not a former president. She was a 
presidential nominee who failed 
to win the election.”

Others are upset that despite 

the book’s title, Clinton doesn’t 
really offer an answer as to what 
happened. 
Stehlin 
explained 

that while Clinton does plenty 
of talking about how Bernie 
Sanders, Russia, James Comey, 
and voters’ sexism negatively 
impacted her campaign, she does 
little to explain her decisions that 
may have hurt her campaign — 
like her Iraq War vote, her Patriot 
Act vote, her orchestration of 
interventions 
in 
Libya 
and 

Honduras and her abandonment 
of single-payer healthcare.

“For me, and many others on 

the left, the problem isn’t that 
Hillary Clinton chose to write a 
book and do a speaking tour, but 
rather the content of the book and 
the ways in which she has tried to 
rehash the 2016 election in order 
to set a narrative that fits her 
worldview.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair of 

the University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, 
agreed 
Clinton 

focuses too much on placing 
blame. He said the high costs of 
her tour seem contradictory to her 
calls for equal access to education 
and resources.

“She continues to shamelessly 

take people’s money to boost 
her own self esteem after a year 
in denial that the only person 
she has to blame for losing the 
election is herself,” Merrill said.

Stehlin added that Clinton 

fails to explain the downfall of 
her campaign and that of the 
Democratic party as a whole.

“The Democrats have lost 

over 1,000 seats in the Congress 
and 
state 
legislatures 
since 

Obama’s 
election 
in 
2008,” 

Stehlin said. “Clearly, the status 
quo is not working, yet Hillary’s 
analysis fails to explain this 
trend.”

Regardless, many are still 

excited for the opportunity to 
hear from one of our country’s 
most influential politicians. LSA 
sophomore Emma Wergeles said 
she already purchased tickets to 
the tour.

“As a woman who is incredibly 

driven myself, the opportunity 
to see someone I have looked up 
to my whole life is something I 
can’t pass up,” Wergeles said. “I 
am also in the middle of reading 
her book and hope to gain more 
insight on the current political 
state from hearing her speak.”

me,” Jawad said.

Williams, 
while 
at 
the 

University, 
dedicated 
himself 

to student ministries, leading 
small Bible study groups and 
cancer research. When he found 
out he was nominated for the 
Rhodes Scholarship, he planned 
to pursue a Ph.D. in oncology 
at Oxford, with the hopes of 
becoming a physician scientist 
and completing his M.D. in the 
United States when he comes 
back. He said being selected by 
the University alone is humbling, 
and he’s excited to move forward 
in the competition.

“It was really quite an honor 

when I found out, considering 
that I know only so many students 
applying within the University of 
Michigan have the opportunity 
to be nominated so I was pretty 
excited to be honored with that 
opportunity and going forward, 
I’m excited to be able to represent 
the University of Michigan in the 
competition,” Williams said. “It’s 
really quite a privilege to get to 
this point and I’m quite happy to 
make it this far.”

Also in the field of science, Liu 

graduated from the University 
last April with a degree in cellular 
and molecular biology. While at 
the University, she participated 
in years of biological research, 
co-authored 
publications 
and 

conducted summer research at 
the Mayo Clinic. She was also a 

peer mentor at the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
throughout her undergraduate 
career. After applying last year 
for the scholarships and not being 
nominated, she said this year 
was an amazing and humbling 
surprise.

Liu said she hopes to bridge 

the gap between natural science 
and social justice to examine 
how medicine has impacted 
disadvantaged 
members 
of 

society.

“Science and medicine have 

historically been deeply harmful 
to marginalized communities, 
they’ve often upheld injustice 
and oppression and so coming 
from both sides … I hope to really 
be pursuing a synthesis of those 
two disciplines and of those two 
communities,” Liu said.

Shepard, the fourth nominee 

for 
Rhodes 
and 
Marshall, 

dedicated 
her 
time 
at 
the 

University to studying civil rights 
law. She contributed to civil 
rights litigation documents for 
the online Civil Rights Litigation 
Clearinghouse at the University 
of Michigan Law School, was 
an associate justice for CSG 
judiciary and served on the 
Office of Student Conflict Student 
Advisory Board. She echoed Liu’s 
sentiments about synthesizing 
disciplines and, like Williams, 
plans on pursuing another degree 
after graduate study if she were to 
be awarded a scholarship.

“My goals are to combine the 

certain social science theories 
that I get through Rhodes or 

Marshall with a J.D. and then 
litigate prison reform or criminal 
justice reform cases,” Shepard 
said.

The 
application 
processes 

for the Rhodes and Marshall 
scholarships are long and require 
a certain amount of concentration 
that demonstrates commitment 
to the candidates’ future goals. 
After 
inquiry 
emails 
about 

information sessions are sent 
out to students across campus, 
about 150 students came to the 
sessions this year. Students 
then met with Dyson and other 
members of the nominating 
committee to figure out if their 
resumes and goals were aligned 
with the scholarships. After 
submitting written applications, 
which include multiple letters of 
recommendation and a personal 
statement, the nominees are 
chosen by the University.

After the nominations are 

submitted by the University, 
a paper cut is made and the 
remaining nominees from all 
over the country go to regional 
selection committees for final 
interviews. Each scholarship 
will 
receive 
about 
1000 

nominations, 
according 
to 

Dyson.

Both Jawad and Shepard 

said the application experience 
allowed them to explore their 
future opportunities and make 
some decisions as to what their 
goals are.

SCHOLARSHIP

he was “counting on Michigan to 
support this and get this across 
the line.”

“President 
Trump 
said 

yesterday 
tax 
reform 
has 

historically not been a partisan 
issue. It doesn’t have to be a 
partisan issue today,” he said. 
“Call both your senators –– 
especially Debbie Stabenow: Tell 
her Michigan needs a tax cut, and 
Michigan needs it now.”

And 
while 
Stabenow 
has 

indicated she supports bipartisan 
tax reform, she said she has 
concerns with the plan proposed 
by Republicans.

“Our tax code shouldn’t be 

so complicated that you need 
to buy a computer program or 
hire an accountant to file your 
taxes. I support reform that 
simplifies our tax code, puts more 
money back into the pockets 
of hardworking families, helps 
small businesses, and spurs job 
creation in Michigan,” she said in 
a statement. “I am concerned that 
today’s proposal would give most 
of the benefits to those at the top 
and would take away important 
tax 
incentives 
for 
Michigan 

manufacturers. As we work on 
reform in the coming months, 
the bottom line for me is that any 
reform must be bipartisan, help 
Michigan families and create 
Michigan jobs.”

Though there are many details 

that have yet to be worked 
out, 
Republicans 
released 
a 

general framework for the plan 
Wednesday. Ahead of Pence’s 
remarks, 
Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder 

stressed “it is time for reform.”

“If you want to add taxes then 

there are three words you should 
always look for: Is it simple, is it 
fair, is it efficient?” he asked. “If 
you look at the current internal 
revenue help, it’s confusing, it’s 
complex, it’s inefficient.”

Snyder said the location of the 

event was symbolic of the power 
of American manufacturing.

“It’s 
outstanding 
–– 
this 

company 
has 
been 
around 

only 20-some years and is an 
illustration of what we can make 
right here in Michigan, what we 
can make right here in America, 
and we should be proud,” he said.

American Axle, however, has 

a history of outsourcing their 
workforce. In 2008, the day 
after workers accepted wage and 
benefit reductions at the end of 
an 87-day strike, the company 
announced it was downsizing –– 
shrinking their workforce of 3,650 
employees by almost 2,000. And 
in 2009, the company chose to 
shift much of their manufacturing 
operations to Mexico, costing 500 
jobs in Detroit.

Discussing the effects of the 

plan, Pence said it would get rid 
of loopholes “that benefit the 
wealthy and the well-connected 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
working 

families.”

“Tax cuts mean more jobs,” 

he said. “Tax cuts mean higher 
wages. And tax cuts mean more 
money in your pockets.”

Though he didn’t refer to any 

specific loopholes, the recently-
released framework makes it 
clear the wealthy would benefit 
greatly. One of the most major 
provisions in the proposal is 
the consolidation of the tax rate 
structure from seven brackets 
to three, at rates of 12, 25 and 35 
percent. It isn’t clear what income 

levels 
those 
brackets 
would 

cover. The highest rate under the 
current structure is 39.6 percent, 
which only applies to married 
couples making at least $470,700, 
or individuals making at least 
$418,400 –– meaning those at 
the top would receive a tax cut of 
almost 5 percent.

Another highly-touted aspect 

of the proposal is the repeal of the 
estate tax –– or, as Pence refered 
to it, the death tax.

“We will end the American 

tax on death,” Pence said.

The estate tax is a tax on the 

value of estates handed down in 
wills, which only affects the very 
wealthy. Only estates worth over 
$5.5 million for individuals or 
$11 million for married couples 
require estate tax filings, and 
after deductions and tax credits, 
only about half of those pay any 
tax –– translating to 0.2 percent 
of all estates in the country.

While 
she 
acknowledged 

there 
was 
significant 
need 

among 
the 
middle 
class, 

Schindlbeck said she di dn’t 
think the benefits to the wealthy 
under the proposal were a bad 
thing.

“Why punish the people who 

are successful? That’s how I 
feel. I mean, amen. If they’re 
successful, I feel, let them be 
successful,” she said. “I think 
what’s fair for me is fair for you. 
That’s how I look at it –– I think 
seeing something where it’s 
more straight across the board Is 
what is more fair. The gentleman 
who owns this corporation –– 
good for him. If he’s knowing 
how to run a business, and he 
knows how to create jobs and a 
good product, why punish him 
for making a good living? Let 
him flourish. Go for it.”

in the Teach-Out discussions 
themselves,” Hilton said.

LSA senior Alanah Bratley, 

who is taking Professor Samson’s 
Atmospheric 
Science 
class, 

submitted a question to extreme 
weather 
experts: 
“Does 
the 

amplitude of the storm surge play 
a role in determining the category 
of the hurricane?”

Bratley explained the topics 

Samson covers in the course, 
including how hurricanes form, 
the different types of categories 
and the effect these storms have 
on infrastructure and economy.

In light of the recent surge 

of hurricanes making landfall, 
Bratley 
emphasized 
that 
she 

appreciated the content, stating, 
“I think the professor did a 
good job presenting all of this 
information to us and making us 
aware of factors other than just 
how (hurricanes) occur from a 
meteorology standpoint.”

Physics 
professor 
Timothy 

McKay also noted the influence 
of students’ roles as both learners 
and instructors in Teach-Outs.

“The ‘Reach Out and RELATE’ 

Teach-Out was largely led by 
the RELATE team — a group of 
UM graduate students who came 
together in the wake of the March 
for Science to help scientists learn 
how to share their research with 
the public,” McKay said. 

Arun Agrawal, professor of 

environment and sustainability, 
taught the first Teach-Out — 
“Democratic 
to 
Authoritarian 

Rule” — in response to the 
growing issue of threats to 
global democracies. In an email 

interview, Agrawal highlighted 
his course’s success in reaching 
such a wide range of students.

“We had roughly 1,650 learners 

enroll in the teachout with an age 
range of 16 to 81 years,” Agrawal 
wrote. “They came from more 
than 100 countries/regions, and 
400 of them engaged with course 
materials and issues actively 
by contributing remarks and 
comments.”

McKay commented on how 

international students were able to 
contribute their own experiences 
to 
the 
conversation. 
“Many 

individuals shared stories of how 
democratic norms decayed and 
disappeared in their countries, and 
how they sometimes returned.”

Revamping the the Teach-Ins 

of the 1960s on a 21st-century 
educational platform has proven 
to reach a much broader audience. 
James DeVaney, associate vice 
provost of academic innovation, 
underscored the success of having 
Teach-Outs on massive online 
open courses through edX and 
Coursera.

“We 
recently 
surpassed 
6 

million 
enrollments 
in 
U-M 

(MOOCs) since launching our 
first in 2012,” DeVaney said. “We 
are comfortable with reach. With 
our Teach-Out experiments we 
are seeking to go beyond reach 
and increase diversity, improve 
interactions and create more 
inclusive learning environments.”

Using the edX and Coursera 

platforms 
as 
a 
foundation, 

Devaney emphasized the series’ 
goal to change the University’s 
approach to public engagement.

“We are well on our way to 

moving beyond a broadcast model 
and toward creating a sustained 
model for two-way engagement 

with lifelong learners from around 
the globe,” Devaney said.

After the first several Teach-

Outs, Hilton noted a few changes 
that will be made to improve the 
series, such as having more rapid-
response style courses and having 
a more timely release schedule.

The 
“Hurricanes: 
What’s 

Next?” Teach-Out models this 
instant approach, since according 
to 
Hilton, 
Samson 
covered 

hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose 
and Maria within one week in the 
middle of hurricane season.

“In 
contrast 
to 
Teach-

Outs with a somewhat longer 
development timeline, this type 
of Teach-Out aims to provide 
an immediate opportunity for 
informed discussion during, or 
immediately 
after, 
culturally-

significant 
stories 
emerge,” 

Hilton said.

The program is always looking 

for fresh ideas and relevant 
topics 
for 
future 
Teach-Out 

events. Hilton emphasized their 
continuous efforts to collaborate 
with University students and 
faculty to discover diverse topics 
and create engaging campus 
events 
to 
foster 
meaningful 

discussion.

According to McKay, some 

of the upcoming topics include 
conversations 
about 
internet 

freedom, sleeplessness, privacy 
and reputation.

DeVaney 
mentioned 
the 

program’s goal to engage other 
institutions in these current 
Teach-Out 
conversations 
like 

they did several decades ago when 
the teach-in series was born.

the decision.

Business 
junior 
Jovany 

Flores, president of Lambda 
Theta Phi, said he wanted to 
contribute to the collective 
efforts 
of 
a 
community 

that nurtured him and his 
brothers. Over the past two 
weeks, Flores and his brothers 
held 
fundraisers, 
accepted 

donations from alumni and 
people in the community and 
spread awareness about the 
situation.

“Since the community we 

are most involved in … and we 
(ourselves) are Latinos, we 
thought this was a great way to 
give back,” Flores said.

Business 
sophomore 

Salvador Vargas, vice president 
of Lambda Theta Phi, added 
that his fraternity has also been 
in contact with other Latino 
organizations 
on 
campus, 

such as the Latinx Alliance for 
Community Action, Support 
and 
Advocacy 
Pluma 
and 

graduate students, looking for 
potential applicants.

Vargas said he made sure the 

scholarships were awarded on 
a first-come, first-serve basis 
so that the fraternity did not 
need to screen people.

“We don’t want to create a 

criteria for something’s that’s 
so sensitive,” Vargas said. “It 
becomes very, very hard to 
select somebody over another 
especially with such a serious 
topic.

Flores said his fraternity is 

currently in contact with two 
students who are interested in 
the scholarship. He noted that, 
as a minority in a predominantly 
white institution, he wanted 
to help his community out in 
anyway possible — whether 
economic, academic or social.

“We want to empower each 

other 
because 
there’s 
low 

percentages of (Latinos) on 
campuses around the U.S. in 
general,” Flores said. “So we’re 
trying to break the barriers 
that are preventing us from 
having that number increase.”

Lambda Theta Phi’s program 

is the latest in a series of 

initiatives in Ann Arbor set 
up 
to 
help 
undocumented 

immigrants in uncertain times. 
In the past few months, City 
Council passed an ordinance 
forbidding 
police 
officers 

from 
soliciting 
residents’ 

immigration 
status, 
and 

churches 
and 
synagogues 

in 
Washtenaw 
County 

formed a coalition to shield 
undocumented 
immigrants 

facing deportation from U.S. 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 

Enforcement agents. BAMN, 
an action-oriented civil rights 
group, led a rally earlier this 
month demanding Ann Arbor 
become a sanctuary city.

Vargas said allowing others 

to continue their education 
undisturbed 
is 
central 
to 

Lambda Theta Phi’s identity 
because one of his fraternity’s 
missions 
is 
academic 

excellence.

“A lot of us come from 

marginalized communities, you 
know,” Vargas said. “If we’re 
given this opportunity to come 
study out here, it’d be great to 
be able to give that opportunity 
back to somebody.”

I 

called my grandparents, 
hoping 
to 
hear 
their 

whereabouts. 
With 
the 

stress of a new school year and 
a new house distracting me 
from my family and home life, 
I was overwhelmed with guilt 
as I watched the coverage of 
Hurricane Irma on CNN. As 
residents of Boynton Beach, 
Florida, my grandparents were 
poised to be in the center of the 
path of the second deadliest 
hurricane to pass over the 
United States this year. 

I was relieved to hear my 

grandma pick up, and that both 
her and my grandpa were safe 
at a nearby cousin’s house. But 
the stress of this uncertainty 
sparked my attention to the 
destruction of this hurricane 
and its predecessor, Hurricane 
Harvey, and the relief efforts 
following each.

For such a colossal natural 

disaster, surpassing Hurricane 
Katrina’s 
statistics 
with 

an 
estimated 
$190 
billion 

in 
damages 
to 
housing, 

infrastructure 
and 
the 

environment, 
one 
would 

expect the president to play a 
prominent role in relief efforts. 
Instead, 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s initial response was 
both distracting and distant 
from the lethal hurricane, 
exemplified by his out-of-place 
tweets. And while it would 
seem to be common sense that 
the government is the best 
outlet for relief funding, a 
variety of musicians, athletes 
and other celebrities stepped 
up while the president hid 
behind his keyboard — an 
indication of the power of 
the 
entertainment 
industry 

that should serve as a wake-
up call to the entire Trump 
administration.

“With Mexico being one of 

the highest crime Nations in 
the world, we must have THE 
WALL. Mexico will pay for 
it 
through 
reimbursement/

other,” Trump tweeted on Aug. 
27, the day that record rainfall 
began to destroy Houston. By 
tweeting about Mexico and the 
plan to build his infamous wall, 
Trump’s stubborn obsession 
with border control seemed 
to be on the forefront of his 
mind, despite 30,000 Houston 
residents losing their homes 
over the weekend.

Not 
only 
did 
Trump’s 

initial response demonstrate 

his 
devotion 
to 
campaign 

promises (despite other, more 
immediate concerns), but the 
rhetoric and method of his 
action were consistent with 
his entire presidency — saying, 
rather than doing.

Using 
Twitter 
as 
the 

primary 
platform 
for 
his 

concerns, policy ideas and 
insults, Trump has maintained 
distance from the hands-on 
work necessary in situations 
like this.

However, 
others 
have 

stepped up. Houston native 
and Grammy Award-winning 
rap artist Travis Scott traveled 
to 
the 
disaster 
scene 
to 

personally work the phones 
during a Dell- and Verizon-
backed telethon, which raised 
over $55 million. It is worth 
noting that the telethon was 
organized by the same people 
who put together the One Love 
Manchester benefit concert, 
which raised over $13 million 
for victims of the bombing at 
an Ariana Grande concert.

In an equally admirable 

show 
of 
support, 
Houston 

Texans 
defensive 
end 
J.J. 

Watt raised over $17 million 
through online donations — 
with estimates of the total fund 
reaching over $20 million. On 
the other hand, Trump raised 
only $1 million on his own, 
despite his business success 
placing him at a net worth of 
$3.5 billion, reopening the 
door to the criticism he faced 
when he bailed on a $5 million 
promise to veterans last year.

This all goes to show that 

singers and athletes hold a place 
in society far more important 
than we would think. While 
Travis Scott has garnered fame 
for his rowdy performances and 
stage dives, his involvement 
with Hurricane Harvey relief 
illustrates that the power of a 
musician extends beyond the 
bounds of a stage.

Similar to the scrutiny faced 

by former President George W. 
Bush after his slow response 
to Hurricane Katrina, I argue 
that Trump’s initial action 
was no better — especially in 
contrast to the generous and 
upstanding behavior of the 
entertainment industry.

To his credit, Trump did 

eventually act on the situation. 
On Sep. 1, he asked Congress 
for $7.9 billion to aid in relief 
efforts, a promising sign given 
his initial hesitation.

But the eventual asking of 

Congress for relief funds, a 
no-brainer for any president 
confronted with this situation, 
should not cloud out the fact 
that Trump’s rhetoric and 
the slow speed with which 
he acted are not admirable. 
In fact, when the president 
finally made the trip down 
to Houston, he encouraged 
victims to “have a good time” 
as he left the shelter — a stark 
contrast 
to 
Travis 
Scott’s 

empathic and hands-on work 
with the telethon.

Ultimately, the fact that 

athletes 
and 
entertainers 

garnered 
more 
positive 

attention than the president 
for 
their 
relief 
efforts 

should sound an alarm in 
the Oval Office. A swift and 
compassionate response to one 
of the most destructive natural 
disasters in recent memory 
would have been a beneficial 
move for a president whose 
overall 
administration 
has 

been divisive.

Instead, immigration policy 

and personal matters seemed 
to cloud Trump’s brain as he 
once again took to Twitter 
to express his thoughts. And 
even in the wake of Hurricane 
Harvey, 
Trump 
continues 

to face opposition for his 
comments, 
highlighted 
by 

an NFL-wide protest of the 
national anthem this Sunday.

As 
racial 
and 
political 

tensions 
continue 
to 
rise 

across 
the 
country, 
the 

entertainment 
industry 

capitalized on a crucial chance 
to unite and give back where 
Trump did not — a missed 
opportunity that was much 
needed as public distaste for 
the administration continues 
to grow.

What entertainers got right

 BEN CHARLSON | COLUMN

Ben Charlson can be reached at 

bencharl@umich.edu.

I 

t’s ironic when you think 
about it: White, cisgender 
men 
have 
ridiculed 

marginalized 
groups 
for 

needing safe spaces and called 
us snowflakes, yet they are now 
demanding a safe space of their 
own. Of course they are. They 
simply cannot stand us having 
something they don’t. 

As a transgender man, I was 

socialized as a woman for 18 years 
before I began transitioning. I 
have navigated the world as a 
man for the past six years and 
have a complicated relationship 
with masculinity. Since I began 
passing as a man, I have constantly 
reflected on my privileges as 
a white man. I have done this 
both through self-education and 
listening to the people of color in 
my life, especially women of color, 
learning how I can effectively 
show up in spaces as a white man.

When I’ve shown up for 

marginalized 
groups 
and 

refrained from taking up space, 
I’ve found that most will call 
you in rather than call you out. 
Marginalized groups do not want 
to exclude people from their 
movements. They want people 
who will show up, respect their 
movement and their cause and 
take what they’ve learned back 
to their circles to educate and 
encourage critical conversations.

I’m not saying that all men 

are evil or incompetent. It is, 
however, necessary as a whole, 
to acknowledge all of the ways 
in which men are socialized to 
put the burden of emotional labor 
on women, femmes, LGBTQ 
people, people of color and other 
marginalized folks. If you seek 
validation for doing any little bit 
of emotional labor, you contribute 
to the problem.

Marginalized 
folks 
need 

safe spaces because these are 
often the only places they can 
be 
simultaneously 
authentic 

and safe in. In a world full of 
microaggressions 
and 
blatant 

discrimination, there is always the 
chance of confrontation. Along 
with this, perhaps surprisingly, 
I agree that straight white men 
need “safe spaces,” too.

I 
agree 
that 
privileged 

people — including straight, 
white, 
rich, 
able-bodied 

cisgender men or people with 
any 
combination 
of 
these 

identities — do need to have 
“safe spaces.” They need spaces 
where they can come together 
and work on these issues 
and engage deeply with their 
privilege 
without 
needing 

people 
of 
color, 
women, 

LGBTQ people, those who are 
disabled or other marginalized 
folks there to educate them.

Ben Bugajski claims, “The 

very 
tactics 
feminists 
have 

adopted to become heard in 
a 
patriarchal 
society 
have 

alienated men and stopped them 
from listening. If in a patriarchal 
society men overpower and 
silence women, then let’s use 
men to spread the message.”

Nobody is telling them that 

they cannot have spaces to 
themselves. In fact, most people 
would argue that most of society 
is very safe for folks who hold 
those identities. The problem is 
not that they do not have safe 
spaces; it is that they do not 
use them intentionally to make 
progress or change. The problem 
is that people who are straight, 
white, rich, able-bodied, cis men 
are not stepping up and leading 
those spaces.

It is not up to marginalized 

folks to make room for straight, 
white, rich, able-bodied, cis men. 
We are already too busy trying 
to fight for room for ourselves. 
In fact, we have asked them 
to create these spaces where 
they can hold one another 
accountable and engage with 
people that look like them about 
these issues. We are tired of 
having to be the ones to do it. It is 
exhausting to continuously share 
our pain, traumas, struggles and 
realities so that straight, white, 
rich, able-bodied, cis men may 
begin to understand the ways in 
which they are privileged and 
oppressive. The world would be a 
better place if they would create 
those “safe spaces” and educate 
each other about why something 
is sexist or why misgendering 
someone — or any of the other 
oppressive actions or biases they 
might enact — isn’t acceptable.

I believe that if straight, white, 

rich, able-bodied cisgender men 
spent as much time educating 
themselves and others as they 
did arguing that they “aren’t all 
bad,” then marginalized folks 
wouldn’t even need safe spaces 
in the first place.

Support student-parents

I

n his proposed budget for fiscal year 2018, President Donald Trump 
recommends slashing funding for the Child Care Access Means 
Parents in School program, which allocates $15 million a year to 5,000 

students who are simultaneously raising families. Despite its miniscule 
budget, these student-parents rely on CCAMPIS funding to continue their 
studies by ensuring their children are taken care of during the school day. 
To give some perspective, in 2015, the Department of Defense budget was 
$496.1 billion. Family status, gender and age should not inhibit access to 
education. Eliminating CCAMPIS directly contradicts the Department of 
Education’s core mission of guaranteeing equal access to education. The 
Michigan Daily Editorial Board calls on the Trump administration to 
reconsider defunding CCAMPIS, and on the University of Michigan and 
other universities nationwide to continue to independently support student-
parents.

The CCAMPIS program only 

covers a paltry 0.001 percent of 
the 4.8 million student-parents 
currently 
working 
toward 

higher 
education 
degrees. 

Current funding for CCAMPIS 
is extremely low compared to 
other federal programs, like Pell 
Grants. At a mere $15 million 
per 
year, 
which, 
compared 

to the entire Department of 
Education’s 2017 $68.2 billion 
budget, CCAMPIS’s budget is 
a negligible expenditure. Four-
year public universities have also 
steadily cut on-campus childcare 
while the percentage of student-
parents in the United States has 
only risen.

This 
combination 
of 
cuts 

to on-campus childcare and 
the impending elimination of 
CCAMPIS will hang student-
parents out to dry. Lack of 
childcare access poses a unique 
challenge to these hard-working 
student-parents as they attempt 
to balance their schooling, home 
life and, oftentimes, a job or two 
on the side.

The majority of the people 

affected by these CCAMPIS 
cuts are women and people of 
color. Forty-seven percent of 
Black 
undergraduate 
women 

have dependent children and 
women are nearly twice as likely 
as men to be student-parents. 
Furthermore, 
statistics 
show 

that of the 4.8 million student-
parents in the United States, 
nearly 43 percent were living 
below the federal poverty line 
in the 2011-2012 school year. 
Therefore, nearly half of all 
student-parents 
would 
not 

be able to afford reliable, safe 

daycare 
without 
CCAMPIS. 

Cuts to this program will only 
hurt those who are already 
underserved in the United States.

If 
the 
Department 
of 

Education truly values equal 
access to education regardless 
of race, class or gender, which 
they tout as core to their mission 
statement, 
then 
they 
must 

acknowledge the transformative 
benefits 
of 
subsidized, 

on-campus childcare. Childcare 
already 
poses 
a 
significant 

financial burden on working 
families, but it is especially 
onerous on student-parents. In 
the state of Michigan, infant 
care costs can reach $9,882 a 
year, or $824 a month. For the 
average Michigan family making 
the median annual income of 
$59,940, 
childcare 
consumes 

over 16 percent of their yearly 
pay. Parents should not have to 
sacrifice an education due to 
expensive childcare.

Studies 
show 
individuals 

with bachelor’s degrees make, 
on 
average, 
$21,100 
more 

per year than those with 
just a high school diploma. 
For many parents, $21,000 
more annually can make a 
substantial difference in their 
well-being and the well-being 
of their children, and it can 
also help future generations 
more 
easily 
achieve 
their 

educational goals.

CCAMPIS 
mitigates 
the 

enormous 
stress 
placed 
on 

student-parents 
when 
they 

have no option but to balance 
work, school and childcare. A 
recipient of CCAMPIS should 
not have to choose between an 

education and caring for their 
child. While this program is by 
no means the be-all and end-all 
solution for student-parents, it 
significantly aids parents for 
the few years they are in school 
working toward a degree.

With CCAMPIS, education for 

student-parents directly translates 
to intergenerational benefits.

The advantages of a college 

or 
vocational 
degree 
are 

undeniable. 
This 
program 

enables 
parents 
to 
access 

higher 
education; 
slashing 

CCAMPIS funding would only 
hurt 
motivated 
Americans 

who want an education for 
themselves and their children.

The 
Department 
of 

Education must take action to 
help support student-parents 
by making child care resources 
more accessible and affordable. 
Family status should have no 
bearing on whether a person 
can 
attain 
an 
education. 

With CCAMPIS, this dream 
becomes a reality and leads 
to innumerable benefits for 
parents, their children and 
society as a whole.

Rather 
than 
eliminating 

CCAMPIS, 
Trump 
and 

Secretary 
of 
Education 

Betsy DeVos should consider 
expanding the program to 
reach more of the 4.8 million 
parents in the U.S. working 
toward their degrees. In the 
meantime, we implore the 
University 
and 
universities 

nationwide 
to 
continue 
to 

step up, even if the federal 
government 
will 
not, 
and 

continue to create programs to 
support student-parents.

Trump’s rhetoric 
and slow speed 
are not admirable

We are too busy 
trying to fight 
for room for 

ourselves


Walking along State towards 

the Diag last semester, simply 
put, was annoying. Though 
it sounds high maintenance, 
pedestrians had to backtrack 
to a crosswalk or jump into 
oncoming 
traffic 
to 
avoid 

the construction across from 
Walgreens. 
 
Finally, 
the 

construction 
has 
finished, 

revealing a shiny new and 
desperately needed coffee shop 
(a trendy, college town like Ann 
Arbor can never have too many. 
Not to mention, the coffee shop 
is smack dab in the middle of 
the rest of Ann Arbor’s most 

notable coffee shops.) As I 
pushed through the door, I was 
pleasantly surprised by the 
lack of formality. The shop has 
an urban, almost tech feel with 
futuristic blue lighting and 
intricately piped ceilings with 
black and gray accents. Their 
soundtrack was well chosen: 
not too Top 40s and not too 
weird. The top floor is well 
lit with natural light pouring 
through 
expansive, 
open 

windows along State street.

Their audience was diverse 

and, 
like 
the 
shop 
itself, 

approachable. 
Students 
and 

townies alike occupied the 
space. No pretentious pour 

over connoisseur misheard my 
nervous order, which would 
have 
made 
the 
experience 

awkward. Instead, a friendly 
barista more than happy to 
recommend his favorite drink 
greeted me upon walking in. 
Yet he clearly knew his way 
around all 15 Jamaican blends, 
off-brand Hydro Flasks, and 
aeropresses in front of him. 
Roasting Plant doesn’t try to 
be too cool for the University 
either, sporting M decals on 
their coffee dispensers. It was 
loud and busy, but not too 
loud to zone out and work on 
a project or hear the person 
sitting 
across 
from 
you. 

The tables are well spaced 
with padded seats, but even 
better, there were more than 
enough to host the consistent 
walk ins. The coffee is a bit 
expensive, but felt worth it to 
be surrounded by hundreds 
of 
blends 
and 
incredible 

ambiance. I personally don’t 
know much about the body 
of a blend or the difference 
between fruity and chocolatey 
notes, 
probably 
hindering 

my 
five 
dollar 
cold 
brew 

experience. Because of that, 
I’ll leave it at saying the coffee 
was good, but I also bought a 
grapefruit juice, which was 
phenomenal. Their forte really 
wasn’t their food and pastries 
but they did have a quinoa 

cookie with some vegan curb 
appeal.

The floor below held more 

seating and the descent into it 
felt like a scene from Tron. The 
blue lighting from the top takes 
over, geometrically tracing the 
wallpaper, wrapping around 
the room. The ceiling and 
furniture 
were 
matte 
and 

black. But the best part was 
that it was full of more seating.

My 
only 
gripe 
(much 

overlooked in light of its 
charms) was the feeble wifi 
below the top floor. 

Compared 
to 
the 
other 

popular spots around Ann 
Arbor, 
Roasting 
Plant 

Coffee Shop has become the 
frontrunner. Its atmosphere 

boasts personality like Literati 
but 
acceptance 
of 
every 

form of coffee shop goer like 
Starbucks. I also found a seat 
— not as common in Ann Arbor 
as you’d hope. Students use up 
crucial study time just making 
it to the coffee shop. On top of 
that, paying for Ann Arbor’s 
best coffee means giving your 
left hand for a 2 oz mocha. 
To pay that without a seat 
simply won’t do, so thank you 
Roasting Coffee Plant for the 
opportunity to drink amazing 
coffee and stay there to enjoy 
it.

‘Rebel in the Rye’biopic 
lacks reason & relevancy 

IFC FILMS

Nicholas Hoult stars as JD Salinger in the new biopic

The J.D. Salinger biopic proves lackluster and forgettable 
with Nicholar Hoult and Kevin Spacey as its main stars

“Catcher in the Rye” is one 

of the seminal works in the 
American novel canon. It is 
a novel beloved by millions 
and read by almost everyone 
who receives an education in 
America. It is a book that will 
probably be remembered for 
as long as American culture 
is relevant. “Rebel in the 
Rye,” a by-the-numbers biopic 
written and directed by Danny 
Strong, (“The Hunger Games: 

Mockingjay”) will be lucky if 
its remembered at the end of 
this month.

Starring 
Nicholas 
Hoult 

(“X-Men: Apocalypse”) as the 
young and angry J.D. Salinger, 
the film follows its subject 
from a young age all the way 
through War World II and 
the eventual publication of 
“Catcher in the Rye.” The film 
takes aim at a wide swatch of 
Salinger’s life, and attempts 
to document his relationships 
with his parents, his romantic 
partnership with the daughter 
of Eugene O’Neill, as well 
his artistic nurturing at the 
hands of Whit Burnett (Kevin 
Spacey, “Baby Driver”). The 
problem is that in its attempt 
to cover as much of Salinger’s 

life as possible, the movie is 
unable to cover any one aspect 
of his life to a suitable degree 
of depth. All of the storylines 
feel slightly half-baked, and at 
times its tough not to wonder 
what a more specific version 
of this film might have looked 
like. Based on interviews with 
Strong from several years ago, 
it seems that originally this 
movie was to mostly focus on 
the war and how being involved 
in it affected Salinger and his 
future novel. While that aspect 
of the narrative is certainly 
a major part of “Rebel in the 
Rye,” it also seems like just 
one example of something that 
could’ve been explored much 
more thoroughly were it the 

specific focus of the film.

For their parts, both Hoult 

and Spacey are excellent in 
their roles as Salinger and 
Burnett, respectively. Many 
moments 
and 
scenes 
that 

are poorly written or would 
otherwise fall flat are still 
compelling 
simply 
because 

of the caliber of actor saying 
the words. Most of the other 
characters 
barely 
register, 

and the audience shouldn’t 
blame themselves if they don’t 
remember most of the scenes 
with 
Salinger’s 
parents 
or 

girlfriend after the fact. 

The overall look and design 

of the film is acceptable, with 
its period setting providing 
much of the fodder for the 
artistic design. That being 
said, like many other things 
in the film, the setting feels 
perfunctory, 
never 
fully 

being allowed to come into 
its own. In general the movie 
suffers from lack of artistic 

vision. 
The 
people 
behind 

the production were clearly 
more interested in a straight 
re-telling of the events of J.D. 
Salinger’s life then they were 
in saying anything particularly 
interesting, new, or profound 
about his life. At the end of 
the day, “Rebel in the Rye” 
just doesn’t have anything to 
say. Salinger devotees likely 
already know everything the 
movie has to offer and general 
audiences will be wondering 
why they should care. The 
biggest misstep of the entire 
film is that it ultimately fails 

to shine any new light on the 
subject that the movie is really 
driving towards, the “Catcher 
in the Rye.”

A 
more 
complex 
or 

interesting 
film 
might’ve 

drawn 
a 
parallel 
between 

Salinger writing the book and 
it’s reception and influence 
afterwards. A more complex 
or interesting film might’ve 
shown us how Salinger feels 
about the ways in which his 
book has been used and abused 
since it was published. A more 
complex or interesting film 
might have a single scene that 
is worth writing about. But 
unlike the story of Holden 
Caulfield, “Rebel in the Rye” is 
not complex or interesting, it is 
merely a boring dud.

Lady Gaga’s new documentary is on Netflix now
‘Five Foot Two’ is a raw 
look into a pop giant’s life

New documentary shows Lady GaGa in all the ways she 
hasn’t been seen before: unfiltered, imperfect and vulnerable

“Five Foot Two” is aptly 

titled — because for all the glitz 
and the hype and the drama, 
Lady Gaga is a person first 
and foremost, and a very small 
and vulnerable one at that. The 
Netflix documentary directed 
by Chris Moukarbel (“Banksy 
Does New York”) makes a strong 
case for the humanity of one of 
the most outlandish and alien 
pop icons of our generation. 
Gaga has made a career for 
herself based on a distinct and 
utterly inhuman persona — and 
yet, here she is, inviting the 
world to see her most intimate 
inner self.

The 

documentary 
follows 
the 

making 
and 

release 
of 
her 

album 
Joanne, 

her 
preparation 

for 
the 
Super 

Bowl 
halftime 

show 
and 

her 
personal 

struggles 
with 

health 
and 

heartbreak 
during that time. 
Through it all, it’s 
almost shocking 
how far into her 
personal 
space 

Gaga 
allows 

the camera. We 
see her doctors’ 
appointments 
and 
crying 

breakdowns, and 
no emotion seems 
too personal for 
the 
audience’s 

prying eyes. This 
is, of course, a 
construction of 
the medium (who knows how 
much she’s leaving out?) but it 
doesn’t matter very much. The 
point is that it feels open and 
inviting, and it inspires that 
specific empathy that comes 
when 
an 
audience 
usually 

kept far removed is brought 
close. The most uncomfortably 
intimate the viewer gets is 
when she goes to visit her 
grandmother to play her the 
song “Joanne,” written about 
Gaga’s aunt who died at the age 
of 19. “Did I get it right?” Gaga 
asks before her father leaves 
the room, visibly upset, and 
her grandmother 
cries 
ever 
so 

slightly. It’s such 
a tender family 
moment, it feels 
almost wrong to 
watch it. And yet, 
she 
invited 
us 

here.

The film is full 

of moments like this — personal 
to the point of intrusive. A 

telling scene is 
one in which she 
gets her makeup 
done while she’s 
on the doctor’s 
table, 
getting 

injections 
to 

stop the flare-
ups 
of 
her 

fibromyalgia. 
Moukarbel 
zooms 
in 
on 

her face in such 
moments, 
and 

she 
looks 
like 

she’s 
about 
to 

crack open. She’s 
still strong and 
collected, 
but 

just barely.

Gaga’s 

participation in 
her own privacy 
being disturbed 
is key to the 
documentary’s 
success. 
She’s 

spent almost a 
decade 
hiding 

herself 
behind 

layers 
of 

performance, 

to the point that her carefully 
constructed artifice was the 
performance itself. “Five Foot 
Two” is the latest in Gaga’s 
efforts to tear down those 
walls. The Gaga confessional 
project began in 2016 with 

the release of Joanne itself, 
an 
album 
that 
seemingly 

stripped her back to her roots: 
simple pop melodies, a bit of 
country and rock twang, live 
instrumentation.

Of course, this is a kind 

of performance in and of 
itself, but that doesn’t mean 
that the sentiment behind it 

isn’t 
genuine. 

You could be a 
cynic and watch 
“Five Foot Two” 
thinking 
she’s 

faking her pain, 
or 
that 
she’s 

curating an image 
of a “Real Gaga” 
that isn’t actually 

her. But in this film, Gaga has 
very little time for cynicism. 
She wants to be believed when 
she says she’s hurting.

If a viewer doesn’t buy into 

the film’s arguments for Gaga’s 
fundamental vulnerability, they 
can at least acknowledge the 
massive amounts of hard work 
she dedicates to her craft. Over 
and over, we see her continue 
dancing, singing and acting her 
way through awful physical 
and mental pain. She’s poked 
and prodded every minute of 
every day, and the work never 
stops.

“Five Foot Two” is kind 

of remarkable. It’s a genuine 
showcase of a brilliant artist’s 
life and personality, but it 
absolutely isn’t a vanity project, 
or an 100-minute screed about 
how tired she is and how hard 
she works. Gaga is not one to 
complain, and it’s clear how 
desperately and earnestly she 
loves what she does.

“I’m gonna fight like fucking 

hell for them to fucking love 
this,” she says days before her 
album is released. “Because it 
is fucking lovable.” It’s hard 
to argue with someone who 
believes so intently in what 
she’s making. That’s really the 
main takeaway from “Five Foot 
Two”: Lady Gaga means every 
word she says, completely and 
wholeheartedly. 
And 
that’s 

something you just can’t fake.

Strange Beautiful Music: 

Coffeehouse classical

It’s been 10 years since New 

Music Detroit first began its 
annual concert series, Strange 
Beautiful Music, and as they 
pass this trail marker the 
musicians’ collective continues 
to 
provide 
an 
invaluable 

service to the Michigan arts 
scene — namely, featuring the 
work of composers who still 
draw breath.

Founded 
in 
2006, 
New 

Music Detroit is one of the 
most 
interesting 
cultural 

institutions in the Michigan 
classical 
music 
scene, 
and 

their trademark event is a 
yearly highlight for any lover 
of new music. After a decade 
of existence, Strange Beautiful 
Music remains the largest 
festival 
of 
contemporary 

classical music in the Midwest, 
though the format of the 
festival 
has 
been 
tweaked 

slightly. Over the years, the 
annual concert has sometimes 
fallen across two days, three 
days or — as was the case at last 
year’s wonderful performance 
— on a single, gargantuan day. 
For their decennial, NMD 
opted for the three day option, 
spreading the performances 
not only across a weekend 
but also across the city, at 
three 
separate 
locations. 

Each performance was gifted 
with skillful ensembles and 
compelling programs, but one 
of the downsides to the three 
day format (at least for me) is 
that my attendance was limited 
to a single day. It’s a bit of a 
trade off, a kind of low-stakes 
Russian roulette with your 
schedule. If the marathon is on 
one day and you have a conflict 
you miss the whole thing, but 
if it’s spread out and you’re not 
free for an entire weekend you 
have to miss at least some. But 
either way, attending any of 
the event is a true treat.

I was able to go to the Friday 

night 
performances, 
taking 

place at the Trinosophes, a 
coffeehouse / artistic space 
just south of Eastern Market in 
the heart of Detroit. The venue 
describes itself as industrial-
chic, and I suppose that’s more 
or less the best way to go about 
it. Made up of a large, concrete 
floored and high ceilinged 
room with a dividing wall 
down the middle, along the 
right wall past the entrance 
runs a wooden café bar, while 
the entire leftmost area beyond 
the dividing wall is dedicated 

to space for benches and chairs 
arranged in front of a medium-
sized stage. Along one side 
of the central wall there are 
several bookcases dedicated 
to 
housing 
the 
collections 

of 
several 
leftist 
figures 

affiliated with the coffeehouse 
and Detroit.

I travelled to Detroit with 

two friends, arriving about 
two hours into the evening. As 
we entered Trinosophes via 
the back door, we were greeted 
by the sound of cluster chords 
on the piano and what can 
only be described as the most 
avant-garde game of pattycake 

I have ever witnessed. At the 
piano sat Juxtatonal — a voice 
/ cello duo founded this year 
by Jocelyn Zelasko and Bryan 
Hayslett — playing “DiGiT 
#2,” a piece by Mayke Nas that 
involves alternately slamming 
the piano keys and slapping 
each others’ hands in time. 
The piece bears the seemingly-
paradoxical 
distinction 
of 

being simultaneously a concept 
which had never occurred to 
me and being exactly what I 
expected at Strange Beautiful 
Music. After Juxtatonal’s set 
was finished, I bought myself a 
chai and settled in for the next 
performers, a group called 
YAK.

YAK was very different from 

the previous set, but similarly 
experimental 
in 
nature. 

Another duo, the pair both 
wore grey/brown baseball caps 
with long, dangling strings 
of fabric that obscured their 
faces. It was rather yak-like, I 
suppose. The two played a set 
of ambient, improvisational 
music for strings, percussion 
and electronics, which tended 

to put one into a sort of trance-
like state.

As the evening progressed, 

the 
musical 
offerings 

continued in their variance 
and eclecticism. People would 
filter in and out of the concert 
freely, leaving for dinner and 
returning for another set. At 
some point I went out to get 
pizza, and when I returned 
I was treated to my personal 
highlight of the night, NMD’s 
own performance, featuring 
music by David Lang, Nico 
Muhly, Nik Bärtsch and Annie 
Gosfield. Each of the pieces 
played had something valuable 
to offer, but special praise 
must 
be 
directed 
towards 

Lang’s “little eye,” featuring 
Úna Fionnuala O’Riordan on 
cello, and two “modules” by 
Nik Bärtsch, all of which felt as 
if they enveloped the audience 
in a world of sound that was in 
some ways ritualistic.

The last set of the evening 

was provided by DJ Rebecca 
Goldberg, and members of the 
audience were invited to dance 
along with the music. A group 
of young people cleared away 
chairs to make a space for it, 
and for a good 20 minutes or 
so grooved along — perhaps 
longer, though I was no longer 
there to say (despite being a 
musician, I have an inherent 
ineptitude when it comes to 
dance, and consequently left 
fairly quickly).

But 
these 
inches 
of 

newspaper space aren’t really 
meant for me to review a 
concert I happened to like a lot: 
Rather, I’m supposed to offer 
an opinion about something in 
the classical music world. So 
here’s the thing that has been 
lying underneath the surface of 
the last 800 words — the future 
of classical music must contain 
ensembles 
like 
NMD 
and 

events like Strange Beautiful 
Music. In our ever-evolving, 
increasingly connected world, 
the art form can no longer rely 
on the traditional institutions 
and 
established 
mainstays 

of the classical music world. 
It has to move beyond the 
concert halls and opera houses 
and into the bookstores and 
coffeehouses: Plus, with any 
luck, an added bonus of going 
beyond the traditional High 
Temples of Culture® is that 
more people might wander in. 
So here’s to Strange Beautiful 
Music, and another 10 years.

Amid much anticipation, Michigan set to open new season

The 
offseason 
for 
the 

Michigan hockey team has been 
rife with high expectations. 
The summer has seen countless 
headlines surrounding a new 
head coach, a six-senior class 
determined to rebound from 
last year’s disappointment and 
promising freshmen looking to 
become breakout stars.

This excitement will be on 

full 
display 

Saturday when 
the 
doors 
of 

Yost Ice Arena 
open to mark 
the beginning of 
hockey 
season 

in Ann Arbor 
once again. The 
Wolverines 
will hit the ice 
this 
weekend 

and 
kick 
off 

their 
2017-18 

campaign with 
an 
exhibition 

matchup 
against Western Ontario.

Michigan’s first game since 

last spring will also be the first 
time the team plays under a new 
head coach in 33 years after the 
legendary tenure of former coach 
Red Berenson.

Though just an exhibition 

before regular season play begins 
next weekend at St. Lawrence 
and Clarkson in upstate New 
York, new coach Mel Pearson 
doesn’t 
approach 
this 
game 

differently than other contests.

“This has to be a dress rehearsal 

for next weekend,” Pearson said. 
“That’s one of the things we’ll try 
and line up even this whole week, 
as if it’s another Big Ten week 
playing a Big Ten opponent, so 
everything we’re going to try to 
do is to prepare them.

“With a new coaching staff, 

there’s a lot of things that are 

going to be different in just what 
we do on game day, pre-game 
skate, all those things. So it’s 
for them to learn what we want, 
too.”

The veteran Wolverines share 

their coach’s mentality and are 
intent on instilling the idea of an 
unwavering, winning work ethic 
into the freshmen leading up to 
Saturday.

“It’s like any other game,” 

said senior defenseman Cutler 
Martin. “You’ve got to go in with 
the mindset that you’re going to 
win, you’re going to win every 
battle, every shift. You’ve got to 
go in and take care of business. 
So it’s not really like an, ‘All right, 
I’m going to go in and play a 50% 
job.’ It’s giving it your best effort 
and you’re coming away trying to 

score as many goals as possible 
and limit them to nothing.”

While the team goes through 

the same practice regimen it 
would do for a midseason game, 
there will also 
be a test-drive 
feel against the 
Mustangs. 
The 

coaching 
staff 

will experiment 
with 
different 

systems at game 
speed and assess 
the strengths of 
newcomers 
in 

that setting.

Preseason 

rules restrict coaches from being 
on the ice during practice for 
more than a half hour per day 
— amounting to a total of just 

two hours a week. This makes 
it difficult to implement new 
strategies and find time to fully 
teach and evaluate players.

But Pearson hopes Saturday’s 

game will show 
Michigan’s 
progress 
and 

areas 
for 

improvement 
since 
preseason 

practices 
began 

two weeks ago.

“First 
and 

foremost, it’ll be 
good just to see 
what our guys 
are capable of 

doing, where they’re at as far 
as their execution of different 
systems we’re trying to put 
in,” Pearson said. “Obviously, 

I’m new this year so it’s sort 
of a different look, so it’ll be 
important to see how far they’ve 
come in some of the things we’re 
trying to teach.

“We just want to see some 

excitement, some energy and 
some hustle out there more than 
anything, and then the execution 
of the things we’re trying to do.”

Added Martin: “I think that 

we’ll also learn a little bit about 
our team. We have some new 
guys and we’ll see what they can 
do. It’s their first opportunity 
to show us — to show the 
returners and show the coaches 
— what they’re made of and 
what they’re like in real, game-
like competition. It’ll be a good 
learning experience to see how 
it’ll go.”

And the freshmen are primed 

to show everyone their talents 
from the moment the puck drops.

The highly-touted incoming 

class is led by forward Josh 
Norris, a 2017 first-round NHL 
draft 
pick, 
and 
defenseman 

Quinn Hughes, a likely 2018 
first-round pick. Forward Dakota 
Raabe has also impressed the 
coaches the past few weeks.

In some ways, Pearson believes 

the freshmen will have it easier 
than the upperclassmen because 
they haven’t played under the 
previous system at Michigan. 
This advantage, combined with 
the potential they have displayed 
in practice, gives him the belief 
his new skaters will have an 
immediate impact come game 
time.

“We 
like 
the 
freshmen,” 

Pearson said. “They’ve shown 
that they’re going to compete 
and push guys for jobs and ice 
time.”

On a personal level, Pearson 

is both eager and honored to be 
the man in charge, returning to 
Michigan after 23 years under 
Berenson as both an assistant 
and associate head coach — and 
most recently six years as the 
head coach at Michigan Tech. 
Despite the excitement, it’s first 
things first for the Flin Flon, 
Manitoba native as the team 
makes its way from the dressing 
room to the rink.

“I just hope I go to the right 

bench,” Pearson laughed. “The 
first few times I came in here 
when I was at Michigan Tech as 
the visiting coach, it was really 
strange coming on the visitor’s 
bench and now I guess it’s come 
full circle. I get to go to the bench 
as the head coach.”

As fans file into Yost, freshmen 

and returners alike lace up their 
skates, and Pearson heads to the 
home bench, Saturday will be 
the first look at the new team in 
a new era.

New coach Mel Pearson steps it up a notch for Wolverines

On a Tuesday afternoon, 

with over a week to go before 
the first puck drop of the year, 
Yost Ice Arena feels alive. 

Not 
in 
a 
conventional 

sense, though. The bleachers 
stand vacant, devoid of the 
student-section 
buzz 
that 

will inevitably return to the 
rink 
in 
upcoming 
weeks. 

But off the ice, Mel Pearson 
and his players radiate an 
unmistakable energy.

Just days away from its 

first exhibition match against 
Western Ontario, the Michigan 
hockey team is anxious for its 
season to launch. 

“Overall, 
the 
energy 

(has 
been) 
a 
lot 
higher,” 

said 
sophomore 
forward 

Jake Slaker. “Having a new 
coaching 
staff, 
everybody’s 

starting off at 0-0, so we’re all 
pretty excited to be on the ice 
and to try to make a name for 
ourselves.”

At their official team media 

day last week, the Wolverines 
spoke 
optimistically 
about 

their upcoming season after 
their 2016-17 season fell flat. 
They finished bearing a losing 
record for the first time since 
the 2012-13 year. Michigan 
struggled 
tremendously 
on 

the offensive front, lacking 
firepower 
and 
holding 
the 

third-worst Corsi-percentage 
in the country. As a result, 
the Wolverines failed to make 
the top 20 in the preseason 
rankings. 

Moving forward from that 

point, Michigan has had to 
start putting in the work to 
convert its confidence into 
performance.

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

the past season and a fresh 
coaching staff are assets that 
can be used as motivation to 
defy expectations this year. 
Not to mention, Michigan has 
an 
abundance 
of 
potential 

leaders up and down its roster. 

In addition to the Wolverines 

having a chip on their shoulder, 
Pearson has taken it upon 

himself to combat last season’s 
most pervasive problems. His 
objectives include revamping 
Michigan’s style of play. The 
Wolverines want to possess the 
puck, they want to be fast and 
they want to be aggressive.

Though confined to two 

hours per week on the ice 
leading up to the exhibition 
game, Pearson utilizes these 
short 
practice 
increments 

efficiently. 

“We’re trying to play with 

more pace in practice so when 
we get in the game it will seem 
easier — not that it will be 
but mainly just the pace and 
attention to detail,” Pearson 
said. 
“They’ve 
been 
good. 

We’ve seen great improvement 
from week one when I thought 
they were — I don’t want to 
say lazy, but I’ll use the word 
relaxed a little bit. We’re just 
trying to jack up the intensity.”

With Pearson at the helm 

following 
Red 
Berenson’s 

34-year tenure as head coach, a 
novel dynamic — where players 
are vying to make a positive 

impression on the new coach — 
is becoming the defining factor 
of the preseason.

The 
dynamic 
fosters 
a 

competitive 
atmosphere 
at 

practices, as every player gives 
his all in order to stake his claim 
for playing time. In turn, the 
players reap the benefits when 
their performance sharpens.

“Guys that had solidified 

their spots in the lineup last 
year are now back to fighting 
for their spots again,” said 
sophomore goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne. “There’s big question 
marks as to who’s going to play 
with who, who’s going to be on 
special teams’ time, stuff like 
that. It really forces guys to 
come to practice every day and 
fight for their position.”

Slaker — who saw action 

in all 35 games as a freshman 
last season and led Michigan’s 
offensive campaign with a 
team-high 21 points — echoes 
this mantra.

“I think I just need to 

elevate my game more,” Slaker 
said. “I think there’s higher 
expectations of me this year, 
being an upperclassman, so 
I’m excited about that. Overall, 
expectations for myself are 
just to do whatever I can to 
help the team whether that’s 
getting points, blocking shots, 
playing first line or fourth line 
or even just being positive in 
the locker room.”

Not only have returning 

players contested each other 
for positions, but they have 
been competing with freshman 
forward 
Josh 
Norris 
and 

freshman defenseman Quinn 
Hughes as well. The former 
was a first-round NHL draft 
pick, and the latter is a likely 
first-round draft pick in 2018.

“Quinn Hughes and Josh 

Norris 
are 
two 
high-end 

freshmen,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“They’re worth the price of 
admission, I’m telling you right 
now.”

The 
strength 
of 
the 

freshman class illustrates the 
depth of the Michigan roster 
this season. From a robust six-
senior class, to four dominant 
sophomore 
forwards, 
to 

Hughes 
and 
Norris, 
the 

Wolverines 
have 
some 
big 

boxes checked even before 
their season commences.

The competitive atmosphere 

and 
intense 
energy 
that 

Pearson 
and 
his 
players 

alike have brought to Yost 
so far makes one thing clear: 
Michigan is keen to avenge its 
lackluster season. The ability 
to harness this energy during 
games will be key to whether it 
can succeed.

“Coach 
Mel 
is 
very 

enthusiastic and very upbeat,” 
said 
sophomore 
goaltender 

Jack LaFontaine. “And I think 
the guys are responding well to 
it, and I think we’re seeing that 
a lot on the ice right now. He’s 
very positive and good vibes 
are going around the dressing 
room.” 

After an offseason full of change, particularly at head coach, the Wolverines will kick off a new year Saturday

Bye Week: Evaluating Michigan’s 2017 season so far

One-third of the way through 

its 2017 season, the No. 8 
Michigan football team has 
defied expectations.

Despite losing 18 of their 22 

starters from a year ago, the 
Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 
overall) have found reliable 
options at most, if not all, 
positions on the field. Even 
significant 
question 
marks 

before the season, such as 
the receiving corps and the 
secondary, have proven to be 
surprising standouts so far.

While there have certainly 

been a fair share of early 
struggles — notably, turnovers 
on the offensive side of the 
ball and an adjustment process 
at punt returner — Michigan 
is 
entering 
its 
bye 
week 

undefeated. For a team as 
young as the Wolverines, with 
opponents as strong as then-No. 
17 Florida and Purdue, that’s no 
small feat.

Still, only one game into its 

Big Ten season, much is yet to 
be determined for Michigan 
this year. The Daily evaluates 
the Wolverines’ performance 
so far in 2017:

Offense: C-
There is no doubt which 

phase of the game has caused 
the most concern for Michigan.

It may not seem to be the 

case at first glance, as the 
Wolverines have scored 126 
points in just four games. But 
that total is quite deceptive. 
Michigan 
has 
scored 
nine 

offensive touchdowns on the 
year, dropping that number 
down to 91. The Wolverines 
have their defense and special 
teams unit to thank for the rest.

Redshirt junior quarterback 

Wilton 
Speight 
has 
had 
a 

tumultuous start to his second 
season under center. Against 
Florida 
in 
the 
opener, 
he 

threw back-to-back pick-sixes. 
Against Cincinnati in the home 
opener, he fumbled the ball not 
once, but twice. And against 
Air Force, he led Michigan 
into the red zone four times, 
but couldn’t manage to score a 
single touchdown.

Yet, none of that compared 

to 
what 
happened 
to 
him 

against 
Purdue 
in 
the 

conference 
opener. 
Halfway 

through 
the 
first 
quarter, 

Speight was tackled twice in 
rapid succession. The first hit 
amounted to a sack, while the 
second knocked him out of the 
game with a soft-tissue injury. 
Fifth-year senior quarterback 
John O’Korn took over and 
put together an impressive 
showing, 
throwing 
for 
270 

yards and a touchdown.

After losing all three of its 

top targets from last year, the 
receiving corps has managed to 
maintain a reasonable level of 
production. Junior Grant Perry, 
sophomore 
Kekoa 
Crawford 

and freshman Tarik Black — 
before his likely season-ending 
injury — have provided solid 
targets for Speight. Each of 
the three has one touchdown 
on the season, and only one — 
Crawford — has fallen shy of 100 
yards receiving, sitting at 99. 
Redshirt sophomore tight end 
Zach Gentry and sophomore 
tight end Sean McKeon have 
also 
grown 
into 
reliable 

outlets for the quarterbacks, 
particularly for O’Korn against 
Purdue. 

While the passing game has 

been sorting itself out, the 

running game has provided 
necessary stability. The trio 
of fifth-year senior Ty Isaac, 
junior 
Karan 
Higdon 
and 

sophomore Chris Evans has 
each taken a turn atop the 
pecking order. Isaac has gained 
the most yards with 356, while 
Higdon and Evans have both 
scored two touchdowns.

Defense: A
There is also no doubt which 

phase of the game has brought 
the 
Wolverines 
the 
most 

success.

By every measure, Michigan 

owes its early success to the 
players on the defensive side of 
the ball. After losing all but one 
starter from a season ago, that 
has certainly come as a pleasant 
surprise.

The Wolverine defense has 

demonstrated not only that it 
is the best unit on the team, 
but that it is the best unit in 
the country. Michigan ranks 
first in the NCAA in total 
defense, allowing an average 
of just 203.3 yards per game 
and six opposing touchdowns. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Wolverines 

are tied for second in the 
country with three defensive 
touchdowns — one via fumble 
return and two via interception 
return.

The defensive line, last year’s 

backup unit, has shined in their 
new starting roles. Redshirt 
junior end Chase Winovich has 
been the class of his position 
group, accumulating 24 tackles, 
including 7.5 for loss, and a 
team-high 5.5 sacks — not to 
mention a forced fumble in 

the end zone against Florida 
that led to a touchdown. He 
was named the Walter Camp 
National Player of the Week on 
defense for his performance at 
Purdue — Michigan’s first since 
Jabrill Peppers last season.

Despite 
his 
individual 

dominance, there is another 
Wolverine who has already 
seemed to stake his claim for 
breakout player of the year. 
Sophomore linebacker Devin 
Bush Jr. has proven himself to 
be the best all-around defender, 
tallying 33 total tackles, 5.5 
tackles-for-loss and 4.5 sacks.

The 
secondary, 
another 

potential 
area 
of 
concern 

coming into the season, has 
shown that it is anything but. 
Junior safety Tyree Kinnel and 
sophomore cornerback Lavert 
Hill have led the charge in that 
regard, totaling 19 and eight 
tackles and two and three pass 
breakups, respectively. Both 
also have their names attached 
to the Michigan’s two pick-
sixes.

Special teams: A-
Redshirt 
freshman 
kicker 

Quinn Nordin seems to be more 
machine than man.

In just four games, Nordin 

has been responsible for 44 of 
the Wolverines’ total points, 
hitting 11 of his 13 field goal 
attempts. He can be forgiven for 
missing the other two, as they 
came on a day he had already 
nailed four kicks — including 
two from farther than 50 yards 
to set a Michigan record for a 
freshman.

Fellow freshman Donovan 

Peoples-Jones has also made 
noise on the special teams unit. 
First, for a series of mistakes 
against Cincinnati that got him 
benched for the second half, and 
more importantly, for a 79-yard 
punt return touchdown against 
Air Force that came when 
the Wolverines were clinging 
tightly to a three-point lead.
