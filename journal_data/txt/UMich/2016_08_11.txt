Trump tries to reset campaign 
with economic speech in Detroit

See TRUMP, Page 9

Over one dozen 

protestors infiltrate 
audience and heckle 

GOP candidate

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

DETROIT— 
Republican 

presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump 
visited 
Michigan 
to 

speak to the Detroit Economic 
Club 
about 
his 
soon-to-be-

released economic plan and to 
issue criticisms Hillary Clinton 
amid protests inside and out of 
the Cobo Center.

Trump’s 
speech 
addressed 

his economic plan — one of his 
campaign’s 
strongest 
aspects 

— 
following 
a 
tumultuous 

campaign week, in which he 
controversially 
feuded 
with 

the Khans, the family of a 
fallen Muslim American soldier 
who spoke at the Democratic 
National Convention last week. 
A recent Washington Post-ABC 
poll showed Trump eight points 
behind Clinton.

Also in attendance at the rally 

was Michigan Attorney General 
Bill Schuette who said he cannot 
personally stand by all of the 
statements Trump has made 
but believes Trump is the better 
candidate in this year’s election. 
Schuette said he supports Trump 
despite the comments he’s made 
about minorities — he believes 
Trump is the better candidate in 
terms of economic change.

“I’ve said months ago that 

comments that he’s made about 
women 
and 
minorities 
and 

Hispanics and disables, that’s 
not Bill Schuette, everybody 
knows that,” he said. “But the 
fact is, now we have two people. 
It’s Hillary Clinton or Donald 
Trump, and this is about jobs 
and paychecks, and it’s about 
change.”

In his speech, Trump outlined 

the city of Detroit as a once-
great metropolis, which has been 
ruined by trade policies enacted 
by 
Democratic 
leadership. 

Trump said Detroit’s fall came 
when the government allowed 
other countries to outperform 
the United States.

“The city of Detroit is where 

our 
story 
begins,” 
he 
said. 

“Detroit was once the economic 
envy of the world, but for many 
living in this city, that dream 
has long ago vanished. When we 
abandoned the policy of America 

first, 
we 
started 
rebuilding 

other countries instead of our 
own. The skyscrapers went up 
in Beijing while factories and 
neighborhoods crumbled right 
here in Detroit.”

Trump’s 
speech 
included 

much criticism of Clinton, stating 
her policies would be disastrous 
for the city and country. He even 
said Clinton has contributed to 
the city’s troubles and should 
apologize for doing so.

In his speech Trump accused 

Clinton of still harboring her 
support 
for 
Trans-Pacific 

Partnership — which has been 
theorized by its opponents to 
have the potential to export 
more American jobs overseas 
and 
increase 
the 
price 
of 

pharmaceutical 
and 
other 

high-cost goods — as she had

LAZY DAY

App utilizes 

augmented reality 
to turn books into 
digital adventures

By BAILEY TUCZAK

For the Daily

With Pokemon Go’s explosive 

popularity, augmented reality 
has recently been brought to 
the forefront of news. However, 
Niantic — the company that 
produced Pokemon Go — is 
neither the first nor the only 
company to successfully market 
the technology. A local startup 
company, ALTality, is exploring 
ways to utilize augmented reality 
to aid patients in the hospital 
setting.

Augmented 
reality 
is 
an 

enhanced 
version 
of 
reality 

produced by technology’s adding 
of a digital layer to the real, 
physical world. Ann Arbor based 
tech startup ALTality’s first 
product, Spellbound, is a mobile 

app used in hospitals to distract 
children from scary or painful 
moments by turning books into 
engrossing 
multidimensional 

adventures by using the camera 
on a smartphone or a tablet.

“Basically, you hold up your 

phone screen to a children’s book 
and the pictures on the pages 
come to 3D life and move around 
like a Pokemon moving around 
on your screen,” Bob Miller, 
spokesperson of the Michigan 
Economic 
Development 

Corporation, said.

Miller said some of the game’s 

benefits 
include 
increasing 

compliance with treatment and 
reducing trauma for the children.

Christina 
York, 
CEO 
and 

co-founder of ALTality, said both 
parents and children have had 
incredibly positive responses to 
Spellbound. The game, currently 
helping 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital patients every day, 
started out as an idea that came 
to her while reading in bed one 
night. York, an avid reader, said 
the idea came to her after having 

to pull out her iPad to search 
for the difference between two 
boats described in her book.

“Why can’t I just hold the 

device up to the book and have it 
recognize what I’m looking at?” 
York said.

York then participated in 

the Detroit Startup Weekend 
with her idea for ALTality, then 
called MagicBook. York was 
able to build a team, pitch the 
idea and win the competition. 
York’s team then collaborated 
with Ann Arbor SPARK, a 
local organization dedicated to 
economic development whose 
bootcamp helped launch the 
company to its current standing 
today. 

When asked about the effect 

of Pokemon Go has had on her 
company, 
York 
was 
almost 

entirely positive.

“Pokemon 
Go 
is 
helping 

augmented reality in general 
because it exposes it in a way 
that is fun and non-threatening 
and cool,” she said. “It helps 
people envision the possibilities 
of the technology.”

York said that, while the 

game helps kids get up and 
moving, which is important 
for 
being 
healthy 
for 

treatment, it is not without 
problems.

“The downside is that the 

game has patients wandering 
into 
areas 
they 
aren’t 

supposed to be in,” York said.

While the company has 

already made its mark, with 
its pilot project having 25 
life specialists — pediatric 
specialists who help children 
cope 
with 
their 
illnesses 

— 
utilize 
Spellbound 
to 

help their patients at Mott, 
ALTality plans to further 
expand within the hospital 
network.

The company has had many 

requests to develop a platform 
to help adults and veterans 
cope with their sometimes 
frightening 
visits 
to 
the 

hospital. Whether it bepost-
traumatic stress disorder or 
the loss of a limb, York said, 
augmented reality can be an 
incredible mechanism to help 

At Ann Arbor press 

conference, U.S. 

Representative touts 

benefits of grants

By KEVIN LINDER

Daily Staff Reporter

Local leaders gathered at the 

Washtenaw Food Hub in Ann 
Arbor Charter Township for a press 
conference to discuss the need to 
reauthorize the Great Lakes Fish 
and Wildlife Restoration Act.

Last 
month, 
Congresswomen 

Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.), Candice 
Miller (R–Mich.) and Darin LaHood 
(R–Ill.) introduced the bill for 
reauthorization. The act, which was 
first introduced in 1998 to provide 
assistance to local groups and 
designed to encourage conservation 
and restoration projects, has not 
been reauthorized since 2006.

The bill was submitted by a 

partnership 
of 
organizations 

including the Michigan Department 
of Natural Resources, The Great 
Lakes Fishery Commission and 
nonprofit group Ducks Unlimited.

All three of the aforementioned 

groups 
had 
representatives 

attend the event and speak on the 
importance of the legislation to 
work that they do.

The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife 

Restoration Act of 2016 authorizes 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
to provide financial support to 
states and organizations to develop 
and execute proposals to conserve, 
restore and manage fish and wildlife 
populations and their habitats.

Since 1998, the GLFWRA has 

provided more than $24.4 million 
dollars in federal funding to 157 
research and restoration projects.

According to a press release 

from Dingell’s office, the bill would 
authorize 
$6 
million 
annually 

through 
2021 
to 
implement 

restoration 
projects 
and 
FWS 

activities related to the Great Lakes

More Republicans are unsure 
of climate change, study shows

Municipal tobacco 
law unsettles small 
local business owners

Tobacco stores in Ann Arbor will be affected by new ordinance 

RESEARCH

Researchers believe 

party affiliation 
and rise of Trump 
influenced trend

By MADELEINE GERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a spring 2016 report 

released earlier this month by the 
National Survey on Energy and 
Environment, 
fewer 
Americans 

doubt the occurrence of global 
warming. 
However, 
a 
recent 

collaborative 
study 
conducted 

by professors at the University 
of Michigan’s Ford School of 
Public Policy and the Muhlenberg 
College Institute of Public Opinion 
concluded that the number of 
unsure Republicans is at its highest 
since the inception of NSEE in 2008.

Climate change, which includes 

global warming, is a change in 

weather distributions over a long 
period of time. Global warming 
specifically refers to the rise in 
Earth’s temperature caused by 
human activities that produce 
greenhouse gases, and is a topic 
of energy policy discussion in the 
upcoming election.

The research study surveyed 

768 random adult residents across 
the nation. The participants were 
asked a number of questions over 
the phone about their beliefs 
concerning climate change, and 
their responses were analyzed for 
a variety of factors including age, 
race, education and income.

The study found that the number 

of Americans who believe there is no 
solid evidence for global warming 
was at an all-time low of 15 percent 
compared to last year’s 24 percent, 
and the number of people unsure 
about the case of global warming’s 
existence rose to 19 percent from 13 
percent — a shift from denying its 
existence to begin with.

Sarah Mills, an author of the 

study and postdoctoral fellow at 
the Ford Center for Local, State, 
and Urban Policy, said the high 
temperatures 
last 
year 
most 

definitely affected the conclusions 
of the survey.

“This past winter was one of the 

warmest winters on record,” Mills 
said. “We have seen record heat at 
the beginning of 2016. There doesn’t 
seem to be much else in the climate 
world that would account for this 
growing category of people being 
unsure about climate.”

Mills 
said 
political 
party 

affiliation had a large effect on th 
public’s belief in global warming. 
Among Republicans, 26 percent 
were unsure about global warming’s 
existence.

The 
researchers 
speculate 

the rise in Republicans unsure 
about global warming — instead 
of completely denying its reality 
— could be accredited to the 
Local ordinance 
to raise age of 
purchase to 21

By BRIAN KUANG and 

ISHI MORI

Daily Summer News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

The recently approved city 

ordinance raising the minimum 
age of tobacco purchase to 21 
in Ann Arbor has been met 
with a cold reception from 
local business owners directly 
impacted by the law.

At last week’s City Council 

meeting, about a dozen public 
health 
officials 
representing 

local hospitals and national 
advocacy 
groups 
— 
who 

worked with Councilmember 
Julie Grand (D– Ward 3) in 
spearheading the law — testified 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
expected 

public health benefits of the 
restriction.

Following 
them, 
Chris 

Rosenthal, owner of Tobacco 
Rose Cigars, located on East 
Stadium Boulevard, took the 
podium to oppose the bill before 
the council decisively voted 9-2 
in its favor.

“I’m out-credentialed, I’m out-

dressed, I’m out-documented, 
I’m out-numbered,” Rosenthal 

said, referring to the preceding 
speakers in the public hearing. 
“But I own a small business.”

In an interview with the 

Daily, Rosenthal, who primarily 
sells premium cigars, said that 
even though he doesn’t disagree 
with the health risks posed by 
smoking, he disagrees with the 
manner in which City Council 
pushed the bill despite state 
statutes barring municipalities 
from 
independently 
setting 

restrictions on tobacco sales.

“More 
than 
one 
member 

of Council said on the record 
that they knew it was out 
of their authority to change 
this 
ordinance,” 
Rosenthal 

said, 
implicitly 
referring 

to 
Councilmembers 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5), Sabra 
Briere (D–Ward 1) and Graydon 
Krapohl (D–Ward 4). “And I 
get 
them 
being 
progressive 

and wanting change, but they 
blatantly broke their oath, and 
it’s disheartening; they didn’t 
even put that on the ballot to let 
the public vote on it.”

Rosenthal added that most of 

his opposition to the restriction 
is based on principle, as younger 
consumers do not buy as many 
high-end cigars. Nonetheless, 
he drew issue with what he 
views as the arbitrariness of the 
law; it would still be legal for

DETROIT — During Republican 

presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump’s 
highly-anticipated 

economic 
policy speech 
on Monday, a 
lot was on the 
line. 
Pundits 

from across the political spectrum 
looked toward Detroit for what 
they were hoping would be Trump’s 
unveiling of his goals for the 
economy as president.

However, the reality of the speech 

was much different. In very Trump-
like fashion, the highly-anticipated 
policy speech was delivered to the 
whitest of white collar audiences 
and lacked a meaningful outcome or 
many new concrete policy proposals. 
Additionally, he directed a good 
portion of his speech to attacks on 
Hillary Clinton’s economic plan. 

For me, the most important part 

of the speech wasn’t the lofty talk 
about upstate New York or Trump’s 
claims that he turned around the city 
of New York with his development. 
As a lifelong Michigander, I care a 
lot about how the policies of the 45th 
president will affect the Great Lakes 
State. One of the most meaningful 
lines of the speech came toward the 
end, when Trump said “Detroit — 
the Motor City — will come roaring 
back. We will offer a new future, not 
the same old failed policies of the 
past.”

A promise like this is something 

we’ve all heard before. People who 
claim that they alone know “the 
fix” for Detroit are a dime a dozen, 
and Trump is just another one who 
doesn’t get it. Despite his claim 
about Detroit and many other claims 
about helping Michigan, none of the 
policies he unveiled would come to 
the aid of states like Michigan or 
cities like Detroit.

For example, his policy of making 

child care tax-free doesn’t sound 
like the typical Trump policies, 
sounding rather like the social 
policy of a Democrat. However, 
this policy won’t help Detroit. 
Because Trump’s proposed policy 
will come in the form of a year-end 
tax deduction, the benefits will 
only go to those who make enough 
money to qualify for one of his 
proposed tax brackets. While this 
will help many middle- to upper-
middle-class working families, the 
residents of Detroit, many of whom 
don’t have the money to afford 
quality child care in the first place, 
will not benefit. 

Even more flawed was his attack 

on the estate tax, something that he 
refers to as the “death tax.” Trump 
views the cutting of the estate tax as 
a measure that will help Americans 
out; however, he could not be more 
incorrect. According to the IRS, the 
estate tax only takes effect when 
the value of the transferred assets 
upon death is more than $5.45 
million dollars. The only people 
that this will benefit are white 
collar “old money” Americans, and 
not everyday Detroit residents. 
Just like the child care policy, the 
abolition of the estate tax will only 
benefit wealthy Americans.

Additionally, Trump spent a 

good deal of his speech railing 
what he calls excessive regulation 
by the federal government, which 
in his mind stifles business. He 
called for a halt on new regulations 
and a cutback in regulations by the 
federal government. In a perfect 
world, this new policy would work 
well, but in a world where there 
is no regulation, there is also a 
disproportionate punishment of 
those who are most vulnerable. 
One can argue that a large part 
of the Flint water crisis, a crisis 
that 
affected 
a 
predominantly 

Black 
and 
impoverished 
Flint 

community, happened because of 
a lack of government oversight and 
accountability. Problems like this 
would only become more prevalent 
under a Trump presidency.

Regardless of whether or not 

Trump’s 
proposed 
tax 
breaks 

for corporations or his promise 
to restore law and order to our 
country actually will benefit us, 
one very glaring fact is certain: 
Trump’s 
economic 
plan 
won’t 

benefit the city of Detroit. Sure, 
they may benefit the rich white 
suburban family that can afford to 
spend $10,000 a year on childcare, 
but not the everyday Detroiter.

This, to me, is the reason that 

Trump can’t win. His worldview 
is so skewed that he legitimately 
believes that a few simple tax 
breaks and a few simple tax write-
offs for wealthy families will cause 
Detroit “to come roaring back.” 
Perpetuating a false and dangerous 
narrative 
about 
Detroit 
while 

promising tax breaks for Economic 
Club elites will do more of the same 
for Detroit while benefiting just 
Trump and his white collar elites.

Edited and managed by students at 

the University of Michigan since 1890.

M

ichigan 
primary 
and 

local 
elections 
were 

held on Tuesday, August 

2, 
and 
as 
I 

approached my 
polling 
place, 

I realized just 
how silent it 
was. A flurry of campaign signs 
dotted 
the 
grass 
outside 
the 

building, but indoors, I was the 
only voter. The man running my 
precinct laughed that I was the 
“after-work rush” they had been 
eagerly awaiting. How can a single 
person be a rush? Oh, that’s right — 
because there was nobody there for 
several hours prior to my arrival. In 
fact, the election officials informed 
me that I was the 11th voter that 
day. Eleventh.

I’m registered in an area that is 

primarily students and youth voters. 
Obviously, the fact that this election 
occurred at a time of year when many 
students are off-campus contributed 
to lower turnout at my polling place. 
Voter turnout at other stations or in 
other precincts was probably higher, 
just due to proportional populations. 
However, local and state elections 
are notorious for low turnouts. In 
this particular election, just a little 
more than 17 percent of registered 
voters 
in 
Washtenaw 
County 

turned out at the polls to exercise 
their right to representation.

Just 
17 
percent 
of 
people 

determined who would govern 
our city council. Just 17 percent 
of people dictated the fate of our 
state-level representation. Just 17 
percent of people decided the best 
candidates for county office.

All this, in an election year — 

perhaps the most volatile, visible, 
voracious 
election 
year 
we’ve 

ever experienced. A year where 
young voters have been engaged, 
when first-time voters have been 
introduced 
to 
politics, 
when 

encroachments 
upon 
universal 

enfranchisement have been struck 
down. But simply making people 

aware of the fact that politics exists 
is not enough. Simply sharing John 
Oliver clips referring to Donald 
Trump by an ancient family name 
will not amount to direct, sustained, 
focused action. It may inspire 
people to care about issues of 
immigration policy or xenophobia, 
which are undoubtedly important. 
But clicking share will not alone 
amount to meaningful progress. 
If voters, particularly students and 
youth voters, want to fulfill their 
newfound political engagement and 
reap the benefits of representative 
democracy, it is essential to first 
represent 
themselves. 
Until 
83 

percent of people are not regularly 
failing to participate in local and 
state politics, real representative 
democracy will not be in place.

I 
know 
that 
reading 
about 

candidates’ views is not as sexy 
as 
watching 
Weekend 
Update 

or Stephen Colbert or (the late, 
great show from) Jon Stewart. It’s 
objectively more entertaining to 
laugh about impressions or the 
absurdity of the state of things 
today than it is to do the local work 
of actually changing the state of 
things today. Personally, I would 
much rather eat popcorn and 
hang out with friends and follow 
a political comedian on Snapchat 
rather than waking up early to 
canvass or register voters. I think 
everyone would. And I get that it’s 
more dramatic to wax poetic in 
the “great-man” style of history, 
envisioning an America that is 
shaped primarily and solely by the 
man (or woman) in the Oval Office. 
But evidentiary, tangible progress 
— whether it’s fixing roads or 
building a library for a community 
in need or creating extracurricular 
programs 
to 
teach 
students 

valuable skills or implementing 
city-wide environmental safety 
measures to prevent massive public 
health crises — comes at the local 
and state levels. No matter how 
much you agree or disagree with 

a president, your representation 
in your immediate communities 
will ultimately influence your life, 
your health, your wallet and your 
happiness more.

If you are a Democrat wondering 

why 
Republicans 
control 
the 

majority of governorships and state 
houses, giving a leg up on agenda 
setting, local and state elections are 
the way forward toward change. If 
you are a Republican wondering 
how 
an 
unfit 
demagogue 
is 

dominating and drowning out the 
conservative ideals you believe 
in, local and state elections are 
your opportunity to find honest 
candidates driven by integrity to 
fight for your beliefs. If you are a 
third-party voter hungry for more 
representation of your Libertarian 
or 
environmentalist 
or 
other 

priorities, local and state elections 
matter. If you are undecided but 
fed up with the current state of 
polarization and impersonalization 
in politics, local and state elections 
are your opportunity to weigh the 
candidates on issues that matter to 
you and your community directly, 
intimately 
— 
local 
and 
state 

elections matter.

So, local and state elections are 

important. What do you do next? 
How do you be one of the people who 
helps boost that percentage from 17 
percent to perhaps something a bit 
more representative? Register to 
vote. Find out when elections are 
happening. Become informed on 
local, state and federal issues and 
candidates. Encourage friends and 
family to participate. Attend a city 
council or school board meeting 
and give your input, or check out 
a speech, rally, town hall or public 
event for a candidate you want to 
learn more about. And actually 
get out there — exercise the 
fundamental right of democracy 
and go to the polls.

Engineering performance
T

he 31st Games of the 
modern 
Olympiad 

have begun, bringing a 

new crop of 
interesting 
stories to cycle 
through 
the 

media. Every 
competition demands the utmost 
fitness from athletes: the greatest 
speed, 
power, 
endurance, 

accuracy, strength and focus. 
Athletes must train to the limits 
of their bodies to compete at 
the highest level and partake in 
physical regimens that the rest 
of us can hardly comprehend. 
But often training alone is not 
enough. Having watched every 
edition of the games for as long 
as I can remember, I’ve noticed 
an interesting recurring motif: 
the profound impact of science 
on athletics. For athletes to keep 
up with their competitors, and 
to even dream of setting new 
records, they must rely on the 
latest products of science and 
engineering.

Science 
and 
athletics 
are 

inextricably 
tied. 
Growing 

knowledge of human physiology 
and 
metabolism 
enables 

nutritionists to prescribe the 
most optimal diets for athletes 
to fuel their bodies. Lighter 
materials like fiberglass and 
carbon fiber impart cyclists and 
rowers with speed that would 
be 
unachievable 
with 
more 

primitive alternatives like steel 
or wood. Swimmers no longer 
need to worry about their times 
being mistaken by stopwatches 
now with touch-sensitive pads 
installed in each lane of an 
Olympic pool. Technology has 
unequivocally 
reduced 
many 

of the barriers that prevent the 
human body from performing at 
its full measurable potential.

However, new technologies 

have not always been embraced. 
The LZR (“laser”) Racer, a full-
body swimsuit engineered by 
Speedo, was banned after the 
2008 Summer Olympic Games 
when athletes wearing the suit 
broke dozens of world records, 
including 23 in Beijing alone. The 
suit provided greater buoyancy 
in the water and masked the 
hydrodynamic 
imperfections 

of the body. The international 
governing body of swimming, 
FINA, explained its decision 

with a reminder: “Swimming 
is a sport essentially based on 
the physical performance of the 
athlete.” Swimsuits today still 
cover the maximum amount 
of skin surface area possible, a 
complete reversal in strategy 
from decades ago.

But 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 

burden 
on 
athletics 
due 
to 

science is the pervasiveness of 
performance enhancing drugs. 
This summer’s games in Rio de 
Janeiro haven’t been immune to 
the PED problem. In the lead-up 
to the opening ceremony, a state-
run systematic doping operation 
was uncovered in Russia, almost 
resulting in the banning of its 
entire contingent of athletes.

Not only are new substances 

being 
synthesized, 
but 
new 

effects 
could 
be 
discovered 

in 
substances 
originally 

thought to be “clean.” Some 
banned 
substances, 
like 

pseudoephedrine, are remedies 
for 
everyday 
ailments. 
The 

list of banned substances for 
athletic competition has grown 
dramatically in recent decades, 
but 
it’s 
nearly 
impossible 

to 
maintain 
fairness 
when 

substances impart performance-
enhancing properties that its 
users 
and 
sports 
physicians 

aren’t even aware of.

Largely due to scientific and 

technological advancement, the 
games this summer in Rio look 
tremendously 
different 
than 

the original modern games in 
Athens 120 years ago. But has the 
competition 
really 
benefited? 

Are the performances worthy of 
more admiration? Did Michael 
Phelps, wearing a LZR suit in 
2008 and capturing eight gold 
medals, really outperform Mark 
Spitz’s seven in 1972, when 
swimmers competed in tiny 
speedos and didn’t even wear 
caps and goggles?

My 
firm 
answer 
is 
still 

“yes.” Much of the increase in 
athlete performance in the past 
century has not been due to 
technology but evolving training 
habits: 
longer 
preparation, 

more strenuous workouts and 
optimized diets. The bodies 
of 
today’s 
athletes 
without 

performance 
enhancers 
still 

operate at a level not thought 
possible in years past.

The 
doping 
issue 
will 

inevitably continue to haunt 
sports. While it seems as if it 
has emerged as a more recent 
phenomenon 
and 
included 

some high-profile cases, it’s 
entirely possible that earlier 
athletes may have been prone 
to the same inequity. While 
athletes of the past didn’t 
have the wide pharmaceutical 
selection 
that 
exists 
today, 

doping police didn’t have such 
an array of blood and urine 
tests, 
or 
the 
awareness 
of 

many performance-enhancing 
effects derived from common 

substances 
that 
historical 

athletes probably used.

Athletes competing before 

the widespread notion of doping 
may have taken PEDs without 
the concern of being tested for 
them or even without knowing 
of the performance enhancing 
effects altogether. Returning to 
today, there may be substance-
derived 
advantages 
being 

utilized by athletes today that we 
haven’t even discovered. Today’s 
new drug for the common cold 
may make it onto tomorrow’s 
list of banned substances.

Science and technology have 

unquestionably influenced the 
sphere of athletics, and the 
results have been mixed. Of 
course, athletics should always 
look to human performance as 
its core principle and apply the 
use of new technology fairly. 
Because technology continually 
evolves, so sport will and should 
evolve with it without sacrificing 
its inspiration, work ethic and 
perseverance of its participants.

TV NOTEBOOK

Stirling provides 
electrifying set

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

As the lights shutter in the 

cramped Michigan Theater on 
July 30, the roaring chatter of 
the audience shifts into a hushed 
silence, a product of anticipation 
and the promise of a performance 
to remember.

One of the things that struck 

me as I took my seat on the main 
floor was the diversity of Stir-
ling’s fan base. To our right, teen-
agers; behind us, a family; two 
rows ahead, an elderly couple. 
From the front row, frat boys 
threw up their hands in the air to 
the rhythm of the music as fami-
lies whispered to their children, 
all there for one purpose and one 
alone: to watch Lindsey Stirling 
perform live. Don’t get me wrong, 
there are many musical groups 
that draw a diverse fan base. 
However, it’s what composes 
Stirling’s music that entices fans 
of all ages. Mixing her training 
in classical violin and her enthu-
siasm for electronica, Stirling 
mixes the melody of a symphonic 
performance with the ambiance 
of a rock concert. Let me be the 
first (of many) to say that she 
does, indeed, rock.

Lindsey Stirling first came to 

the American spotlight during 
the fifth season of “America’s Got 
Talent,” coupling an electronic 
violin with a mix of ballet and 
hip-hop dance moves. What made 
Lindsey Stirling so popular at 
the time was her ability to carry 
out both a self-composed violin 
number while dancing at speeds 
incomparable 
to 
musicians 

before her. As a composer, classi-
cally trained violinist and dancer, 
Stirling captures the attention of 
her viewers with cinematograph-
ic videos that keep her viewers 
coming back for more. Yet, for all 
of her talent, Stirling was voted 
off of “America’s Got Talent” in 
the quarterfinals — a decision 
that she credits the success of her 
career. Rather than give up on 
her dreams, Stirling worked her 
way to YouTube stardom, where 
her videos have continuously 
drawn millions of viewers over 
the past few years. Evident from 
her sensational performances, 

Lindsey Stirling shows passion 
and pleasure in her work, both on 
and off the stage.

From the shadows, the silhou-

ette of a violinist appears against 
pulsing and colorful lights. As 
things became clearer, the vio-
linist appears in a blue sequined 
tutu and a pair of Chuck Taylors. 
This is not a classical concert — 
this is Lindsey Stirling. After a 
nine-month break from live per-
formances, Stirling comes back 
to the stage without missing a 
beat. From the first notes of the 
90-minute 
concert, 
Stirling’s 

music is powerfully addictive. 
Hitting every note flawlessly, she 
gracefully navigates the stage 
in solid movements that match 
those of her backup dancers. How 
she manages to play a violin and 
keep her erratic pace is beyond 
me, but it’s mesmerizing.

As 
the 
show 
progressed 

through visual effects and dance 
numbers alike, the crowd never 
lost its beat with Stirling, who 
kept us pacified through breaks 
by stories of love, loss and laugh-
ter. The audience roared with 
mirth when Stirling revealed her 
two attempts at Disney princess 
stardom, only to be offered the 
role of Winnie the Pooh instead, 
and her comeback as a musician 
for the upcoming Disney film 
“Pete’s Dragon.” Solemn crowd 
members held up heart-shaped 
hands as she gave a grief-stricken 
speech about loss and the hope 
that lies ahead, valiantly cheering 
her on as she threw herself into 
the performance of “Something 
Wild,” the most popular song 
on her upcoming album Brave 
Enough. Finishing her perfor-
mance with “Roundtable Rival,” 
a duel of fast fingers between 
a violin and electric guitar, we 
jumped to our feet to cheer Lind-
sey on. Hardly believing that it 
was over, Stirling jumped back 
onto the stage for an encore per-
formance of her “Phantom of the 
Opera” melody, as fans swayed to 
the soft tunes of “Think of Me” 
and jammed out to her rendi-
tion of “Angel of Music,” staying 
on their feet. Even after Stirling 
and her accompanying musicians 
took their leave from the stage, 
the applause continued.

‘BoJack Horseman’: a 
feminist saving grace

Netflix series provides 
insightful commentary 

on abortion

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Film Editor

WARNING: Literally all of the 

spoilers for BoJack Horseman 
Seasons 1-3.

The world of “BoJack Horse-

man” is a world of absurdity. 
While we follow the eponymous 
anti-hero — a washed up, alco-
holic, anthropomorphized horse 
— we’re expected to see humor 
in the hopelessly dismal. I’ve 
laughed as I bore witness to the 
cartoon’s 
depressive 
nihilism 

and selfish drug-induced bend-
ers. But, considering the current 
political climate, I didn’t think 
there was a situation absurd 
enough to make me laugh about 
abortion.

The sixth episode of the third 

season of “BoJack Horseman” 
proved me wrong. The fifth epi-
sode ends with the show’s mar-
ried interspecies couple, the 
human Diane (Alison Brie, “How 
to Be Single”) and canine Mr. 
Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins, 
“Bajillion Dollar Propertie$”), 
finding out Diane is pregnant. 
The last episode cuts Diane off at 
“Mother…” allowing her to start 
this one with “Fucker!” After 
tiptoeing around the issue, the 
couple states their desired plan 
of action at the same time — to 
have an abortion. 

I was skeptical here. When a 

character on TV wants to get an 
abortion at the start of an epi-
sode, by the end, there’s often 
been some change of heart or a 
timely miscarriage. (I’m look-
ing at you, “The Carrie Diaries,” 
“Girls” and “Dawson’s Creek.”) 
But Diane never wavers in her 
decision, and Mr. Peanutbutter 
never falters in his support of 
her.

Considering the subject mat-

ter, the humor in the episode 
surprisingly comes at the audi-
ence from all angles. Diane, 
who manages the social media 
accounts of a myriad of celebri-
ties, accidentally tweets out “I’m 
getting an abortion” to the 40 

million followers of pop starlet 
dolphin, Sextina Aquafina (Dan-
iele Gaither, “MADtv”). There’s 
quick backlash to this from the 
media, with MSNBSea news 
anchor 
Tom 
Jumbo-Grumbo 

(Keith Olbermann, “Countdown 
with Keith Olbermann”) asking 
questions like, “Is Twitter an 
appropriate forum to be discuss-
ing a sensitive issue like abor-
tion? Wouldn’t a better forum 
be… nowhere?” Sextina arrives at 
Princess Caroline’s (Amy Sedar-
is, “Ghost Team”) talent agency, 
ready to fire Diane for this mis-
take. But the three women soon 
realize Sextina’s fake abortion 
has led to her trending like crazy, 
with celebrities like Taylor Swift 
and Nicki Minaj tweeting their 
support. 
Diane 
explains 
the 

response, that “most women who 
go through this never talk about 
it, because it’s so stigmatized. 
The fact that you’re coming out 
like this is huge.” And it would 
be, if Sextina truly was pregnant. 
But with the promise of publicity, 
Sextina decides to fake her preg-
nancy and subsequent abortion.

Sextina accompanies Diane 

and Mr. Peanutbutter to their 
visit at Planned Parrothood, 
walking past the outraged pro-
testers out front with signs say-
ing “Would you abort JESUS?” 
and “Babies are fun!” Satiriz-
ing guilt-inducing laws so com-
mon in states today, Diane is 
required to watch 20 hours of 
puppy videos before proceeding 
and the doctor informs her that, 
“by law, I have to tell you that at 
one month your puppies have a 
favorite color, and that color may 
be blue.” 

What 
Sextina 
takes 
from 

watching Diane jump over legal 
hurdles to make a decision about 
her family and body is the man-
datory shame that accompanies 
abortion. 
These 
procedures 

so obviously have no medical 
importance and exist only to per-
petuate the stigma of abortion. 
Sextina rejects this legal guilt, 
turning it on its head with her 
new single, “Get That Fetus/Kill 
That Fetus,” and announces that 
she will be having her abortion 
on live TV. The dubstep dolphin 
prodigy sings of how baby kill-

ing makes her horny while kick-
ing baby rattles across the floor 
during her slow-motion strut. It 
also doesn’t hurt that the song is 
a veritable banger. 

In response to Sextina’s battle 

cry, MSNBSea gathers together 
“a diverse panel of white men in 
bowties,” commenting so pow-
erfully on the depressing reality 
of who actually makes decisions 
about women’s bodies in this 
country. The scene hilariously 
exemplifies the puerile direction 
abortion debates often take, as 
people without empathy or expe-
rience in the matter make deci-
sions for others. 

Diane stands by, horrified as 

Princess Caroline and Sextina 
plan the staged “live” abortion 
they’ll show on TV. (Eddie Red-
mayne is planned to be booked as 
the fetus.) She continues the dis-
cussion with Mr. Peanutbutter as 
they walk into Planned Parrot-
hood, the posters behind them 
illustrating all the other services 
the organization offers besides 
abortion, which makes up only 
three percent of the important 
work the real Planned Parent-
hood does. Diane, who has begun 
a plot to expose Sextina as not-
pregnant 
fraud, 
immediately 

stops when she meets a teenage 
girl who felt stronger coming 
in for the procedure because of 
Sextina’s music. The slouched 
teen tells Diane, “getting an 
abortion is scary. With all the 
protesters out front, and how 
you have to listen to the heart-
beat and all that. And when you 
can joke about it, it makes it less 
scary, you know.” 

This 
statement 
from 
an 

unknown character is the crux 
of the episode. In a few short 
sentences, this teenager comes 
to represent the thousands of 
women that seek abortions every 
year. We don’t get her back story 
or details on why she’s getting 
an abortion, because she doesn’t 
owe us anything. But by putting 
a spotlight on this storyline, the 
writers of “BoJack Horseman” 
explain and humanize the stakes 
of this issue — one that allows for 
the bodies of women to continu-
ally be called to the stage of suf-
fering and shame.

‘Suicide’ fails to live 
up to its ‘Squad’ goals

FILM REVIEW

DC’s latest a pathetic 
excuse for a superhero 

movie

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

With a talented cast and a 

premise even more subversive of 
the superhero genre than “Dead-
pool,” “Suicide 
Squad” 
held 

promise. Quite 
a bit of promise. 
Add the mas-
sive buzz it gen-
erated — from 
the 
well-done 

trailer 
leaked 

at 
Comic-Con 

2015 — to Jared 
Leto’s shocking 
appearance and preparation as the 
film’s Joker, to the fittingly moody 
soundtrack that was leaked to the 
guilty delight of Twitter, and it was 
fairly easy to buy into the hype.

All things considered, it was sadly 

undeserved, with lousy execution 
at every turn. Stationary shots that 
last too long introduce Amanda 
Waller’s (Viola Davis, “How to Get 
Away With Murder”) plan to fight 
fire with fire by having villains take 
down evil in dangerous missions 
for the government in exchange for 
ten years off their respective prison 
sentences. 
Davis’s 
no-nonsense 

performance makes the stakes her 
character’s gamble has for the safety 
of the country feel palpable. Other-
wise, her central figure would be 
lost among the many dark, drained-
of-color shots that paint the bureau-
cracy she works for.

The bad guys Waller unites must 

successfully collaborate at the risk 
of being killed at a moment’s notice. 
The acting of the Squad itself is 
also solid. The talented Will Smith 
(“Concussion”) as hit man and con-
flicted father Deadshot and Margot 
Robbie (“The Wolf of Wall Street”) 
as the crazy psychiatrist-turned-
right-hand-woman and lover to 
the Joker (Jared Leto, “Dallas Buy-
ers Club”) are stand-out leads. 
The remorse of pyrokinetic gang 
member El Diablo (Jay Hernandez, 
“Hostel”) is brought to life by Her-

nandez’s 
down-to-earth 
perfor-

mance and is refreshing and real in 
the midst of his chaotic associates, 
and Jai Courtney’s (“Divergent”) 
quiet but sure presence is reflec-
tive of the thief’s role in the original 
comic book.

The bad guys must fight the pos-

sessed but benevolent anthropolo-
gist Dr. June Moon, played by Cara 
Delevingne of “Paper Towns” the 
way I play recorder. The way she 
spends the better half of the movie in 
a two piece, after only being capable 
of one expression for the first (dis-
tress) makes clear why she was cast. 
Moon is eventually overcome by her 
alien possessor, called Enchantress, 
and threatens to destroy everything. 
She annoyingly pops in and out of 
the film whenever tension is needed 
or the script gets too close to the 
character development it begs for.

Not counting Delevigne and 

the odd Leto, the latter unable to 
marry his second-rate Heath Led-
ger’s Joker imitation with his curi-
ous El Chapo Guzman aesthetic, it 
would be unrealistic to expect the 
Suicide Squad alone to make up for 
how sloppy this movie is. Listing the 
surplus of protagonists in the film is 
as repetitive as the sequences direc-
tor and writer David Ayer uses to 
explain the circumstances of each 
bad guy before they have to save the 
world together from being sucked 
into some giant vortex of doom (no 
context even necessary.)

It’s clear the Marvel Cinemat-

ic Universe’s precedent is partly 
to blame for “Suicide Squad” ’s 
stretched-thin plot. DC has relied on 
the integrity of their solitary protag-
onists since the conception of Super-
man. Marvel, on the other hand, has 
thrived on keeping its universe fluid 

as to allow for crossovers to maxi-
mize their appeal (just compare 
the box office sales of less popular 
heroes like “Thor” to “The Aveng-
ers” or “Age of Ultron”.) Warner 
Bros. tries to emulate the formula to 
no avail. So little time is spent with 
any of the characters, that “Suicide 
Squad” ’s intent to build brand rec-
ognition for the future installments 
we all know are coming overshad-
ows the chemistry between the 
ensemble cast. A repeat of their ear-
lier superhero failure this year.

However, in spite of my skeptic 

self, I do think DC has a chance to 
redeem itself as there are rumors 
of a Harley Quinn movie. Not only 
would it mean the gorgeous Robbie’s 
talent is taken seriously despite the 
many predictable fanservice shots 
of her butt bared in hot pants, but it 
would also give DC the opportunity 
to be bold and adapt her relationship 
with Poison Ivy, who helps her canon 
girlfriend overcome the effects of 
Harley’s abusive relationship with 
the Joker in a notably realistic way. 
This would be important represen-
tation on several levels. And after 
seeing Harley’s biggest dream in the 
film is to be married to Leto’s sleazy 
Joker in a vision straight out of the 
1950’s, I never want to see Robbie 
or Leto embrace in a film ever, ever 
again.

After looking past the choppy 

editing, weak writing and nearly 
non-existant characterization, “Sui-
cide Squad” has too many unique 
villains and could not find a way 
to showcase them all. No matter 
what DC’s die-hard fans say about 
the critical backlash the film has 
received, the fact of the matter is 
DC’s characters and moviegoers 
deserve better.

HBO finds itself 
at a crossroads

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

We’re used to hearing about 

HBO as being the standard-
bearer of television. For years 
now, it’s the network that’s 
been the most Emmy nominated 
(mainly because of the variety 
and quality of content it pro-
duces). It’s the network that the 
likes of Netflix, Showtime and 
Starz try to emulate in their 
everyday programming deci-
sions.

Yet, HBO finds itself in a pre-

carious position for the first 
time in several years. While 
there’s no denying the massive 
success of “Game of Thrones,” 
the drama will only have two 
more seasons on the air. Out-
side of “Thrones,” the network 
has very few other established 
dramas. “The Leftovers” is its 
only other drama existing past 
its first season, and that will 
end with its third airing in 
2017. Their last big attempt at a 
drama hit, “Vinyl,” was uncer-
emoniously unrenewed after it 
realized the dramatic retooling 
the show’s second season would 
require wasn’t worth the invest-
ment. They’re even considering 
reviving the “True Detective” 
franchise after its critically 
panned second season without 
showrunner Nic Pizzolatto.

That means that, if nothing 

else succeeds, HBO will find 
itself with zero established dra-
mas on the network. To combat 
this, they’re going to be putting 
a heavy emphasis on new pro-
gramming. This starts this fall 
with the launch of “Westworld.” 
The network has invested sub-
stantial time and money into the 
series. A pilot was first ordered 
back in 2013, and in 2014 it was 
picked up to series with a tar-
geted 2015 premiere date. How-
ever, production stoppages and 
other delays forced the show off 
that date, and it finally makes its 
debut in October. The network 
also has upcoming shows from 
familiar creators already picked 
up to series. David Simon (“The 
Wire”) will be making a series 
about the porn industry in New 
York City in the ’70s called “The 

Deuce” and Alan Ball (“True 
Blood”) will be returning to his 
roots in family drama, though 
the show does not yet have a 
title.

Still, none of these shows 

are guaranteed surefire hits. A 
development process as tumul-
tuous as “Westworld” ’s does not 
usually inspire confidence. And, 
though Simon has created what 
are considered to be two of the 
network’s most acclaimed series 
in “The Wire” and “Treme,” 
they never had huge audiences 
at the level of a “The Sopranos” 
or a “Game of Thrones.”

All these problems are com-

pounded by the recent regime 
change at the network. Michael 
Lombardo 
recently 
left 
his 

position as president of the 
network and was replaced by 
one of his key deputies Casey 
Bloys to replace him. Usually it 
takes a new leader a few years 
to establish their presence at 
the network and develop shows 
in their own voice, but HBO 
doesn’t have time to lose. It 
needs to work on developing 
hits fast. HBO’s development 
process is notoriously slow, as 
exhibited by “Westworld.” They 
don’t have the years it takes to 
slowly nurture something out 
of the gate right now. They need 
to get a hit drama on the air in 
the next year, or they risk being 
without one at all.

However, 
HBO 
has 
been 

in this position before. “The 
Sopranos” went off the air in 
2007 and was immediately fol-
lowed up by the flop “John from 
Cincinnati” and “Tell Me You 
Love Me,” which was renewed 
for a second season and can-
celled 
several 
months 
later 

when they couldn’t figure out 
what a second season would be. 
Still, a year later, “True Blood” 
premiered. The vampire drama 
quickly grew into the network’s

Republican presidential nominee, 
Donald Trump, who denies global 
warming. While some Republicans 
may agree that global warming is 
real and a problem to be reconciled 
with, they do not want to oppose 
their party’s nominee. In March, 
Trump told theWashington Post 
that he is not a believer in man-made 
climate change, adding that “biggest 
form of climate change we should 
worry about is nuclear weapons.”

Mills continued to explain that the 

politics of the Republican Party and 
Trump’s stance on global warming is 
likely to be responsible for this shift 
in Republican opinion to be unsure 
of 
global 
warming’s 
existence, 

instead of completely believing in it.

“The only thing that I can think 

of within the political sphere that 
would point to a growth in this 
number of Republicans who are 
unsure is the candidacy of Trump.”

While there is a greater number 

of Republicans who reported being 
unsure about global warming, there 
is little evidence of Republicans 
transitioning 
from 
believer 
to 

disbeliever status. One of the NSEE 
authors, Christopher Borick, who 
is the director of the Muhlenberg 
College Institute of Public Opinion, 
echoed Mills.

“For Americans who support 

Trump, 
there 
may 
be 
some 

uneasiness in taking a stance that 
is in direct conflict with their 
preferred candidate’s position on 
the matter,” Borick said. “Thus, 
if they tend to believe that there 
is some good evidence of global 
warming but this view conflicts 
with Trump, they may tend to go to 
a more neutral position rather than 
totally reject the existence of global 

warming.”

Another key finding of the report 

was that Americans’ opinions on 
global warming are more polarized 
on both sides — meaning that 
both those who believe in climate 
change and those who do not are 
more confident in their opinions. 
Borick said those who strongly 
believe in global warming base their 
beliefs on scientific evidence and 
the observation of current weather 
patterns.

“It’s 
becoming 
harder 
for 

individuals to claim that there is 
not solid evidence that warming is 
happening,” Borick said. “I think 
the record warmth last winter 
helped enhance confidence among 
those that think global warming 
is occurring.” On the other hand, 
people confident in their denial 
of global warming tend to do so 
because of personal beliefs, region 
in the United States or even lack of 
understanding.

“Our question doesn’t mention 

anything 
about 
human-caused 

climate change,” Mills said. “(The 
non-believers) are projecting into 
it. They are convinced that even 
if the climate is changing, it is not 
caused by humans; it is just natural 
patterns.”

Both Borick and Mills agreed 

that the public’s opinion on global 
warming can have a huge effect 
on the energy and environmental 
policy of the United States. Mills 
said that if more people believe in 
global warming, more efforts can be 
made to slow it down.

“Belief 
in 
climate 
(change) 

can certainly shift what actions 
governments might be able to 
take to address it,” Mills said. “We 
have seen that the Democratic and 
Republican platforms have very 
different approaches to addressing 
the problem or not.”

region, and would require a 25 
percent local match of total project 
cost.

The 
legislation 
has 
been 

introduced as a bipartisan bill, with 
two Republicans as two of the three 
state representatives pushing for its 
re-authorization. Dingell told the 
Daily that common interests should 
help the bill pass.

“I 
introduced 
it 
with 
two 

Republicans and we all live in a 
Great Lakes area,” she said. “We 
have to get the bill reported out of 
the Natural Resources Committee, 
which I think we will, and I think 
it’s just a matter of time to get 
some of these kinds of bill through. 

Hopefully it won’t be controversial.”

During the press conference, she 

spoke on other common benefits 
should see the bill pass through 
the NRC and eventually passed by 
Congress.

“This one’s basic 101,” she said. 

“It’s good for the economy, it’s good 
for the environment, it’s good for 
conservation and we’ve got to get it 
done.”

Experts at the press conference 

discussed why this bill is especially 
helpful for efforts being made 
towards conservation. Gildo Tori, 
director of public policy for Ducks 
Unlimited and biologist, said that 
GLFWRA is different from many 
other federal programs which focus

supported 
it 
while 
working 

under the Obama administration 
and has since denounced. He also 
accused Clinton of supporting 
the North American Free Trade 
Agreement — enacted under 
Bill Clinton — which is believed 
to have resulted in millions of 
dollars of trade deficit with 
Canada and Mexico and the loss 
of millions of American jobs.

“A vote for Hillary Clinton is 

a vote for TPP and NAFTA,” he 
said. “Before NAFTA went into 
effect, there were 285,000 auto 
workers in Michigan. Today that 
number is only 160,000. Detroit 
is 
still 
waiting 
for 
Hillary 

Clinton’s apology. She’s been a 
disaster. I expect Detroit will 
get that apology right around 
the same time Hillary Clinton 
turns over those 33,000 e-mails 
she deleted.”

Trump promised to release a 

more detailed economic plan in 
the weeks to come.

Michigan 
has 
come 
into 

question as a swing state this 
election season, despite voting 
Democratic in every presidential 
election since 1988. Both vice-
presidential 
nominees 
have 

already visited the state, and 
Clinton is scheduled to speak 
Thursday in the state, where she 

will also address her economic 
plan.

According 
to 
Rusy 
Hills, 

University professor of public 
policy, the economic appeal will 
be key for the Trump campaign 
in winning the state.

“This is the number one 

issue: jobs, paychecks and the 
economy,” he said. “He’s right 
in the voter sweet spot. The fact 
that he’s doing it in Michigan 
shows that Michigan is in play.”

Trump’s 
speech 
was 

interrupted by 14 protesters 
— the majority of whom were 
women. 
Female 
protestors 

shouted phrases such as: “You 
have to answer to women,” while 
a sole male protester repeatedly 
shouted “tiny hands” as he was 
escorted out.

Outside 
the 
Cobo 
Center, 

approximately 100 protesters 
attempted to form a human wall, 
blocking Trump’s entry. Signs 
held by the protesters denoted 
a number of controversial issues 
including 
the 
Khan 
family 

controversy, Palestine relations 
and 
Trump’s 
proposed 
wall 

and conservative immigration 
policies.

Debra Simmons, who was 

there 
protesting 
Trump’s 

candidacy, 
said 
Trump’s 

offensive comments showcased 
throughout his campaign make 
him unrepresentative of the 
public.

“Who wants a hater in the 

White House? He’s not for the 
people,” she said. “His issues 
do not reflect what the people 
want.”

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–

Mich.) was also in attendance 
at 
the 
event, 
despite 
her 

endorsement of Clinton. She said 
that despite Trump’s economic 
agenda, his historical actions 
do not indicate that he will help 
Detroit, the state of Michigan or 
the working class.

“He says one thing but his 

actions don’t match up,” she 
said. “While I want jobs here, 
he’s exporting jobs to China and 
other countries. … When he talks 
about autos, Hillary Clinton 
voted for a package that saved 
the auto industry. He opposed 
it.”

18-year-old Ann Arbor residents 
to purchase cigars in Ypsilanti 
and smoke in his store.

Mohammad 
Hassan, 
store 

manager of Bongz & Thongz 
on East Liberty Street, said he 
expects stores selling supplies 
for vaporizers — whose users 
are disproportionately younger 
— to be significantly hurt by the 
new ordnance.

“In Ann Arbor we have a 

whole community of vaporizing 
(vendors), and pretty much it’s 
going to hurt them,” Hassan 
said. “We have a huge vaporizer 
shop downstairs and it’s going 
to be hurt pretty bad because 
a lot of our customers are from 
the age of 18 to 20.”

Hassan said that, though he 

is not as concerned about the 
law affecting his store because 
most of its business comes from 
selling artisan glass pipes, he 
wants to start a petition drive 
with other tobacco shops to roll 
back the regulation.

“(The regulation is) going 

to hurt a lot of people, and I 
do think it will shut down a 
lot of shops here in the city 
and possibly in the state of 
Michigan,” 
Hassan 
said. 
“I 

think businesses should wake 
up. I’m more than happy to get 
together with other businesses, 
but a lot of people aren’t going to 
wake up until it does hit and it 
does affect.”

Hassan also added he expects 

the new law will be devastating 
for responsible student smokers 
under 21 because they must now 
resort to illicit means to obtain 
tobacco.

“Raising the age limit to 21 

is probably going to make a lot 
more kids try to find different 
ways to have people purchase 
the cigarettes,” Hassan said. 
“From 18 now to 21, it’s a huge 
jump. So if somebody’s been 
smoking for two of those years 
and 
can’t 
smoke 
anymore, 

what do you expect them to 
do? There’s going to be people 
finding different ways to scam 
the system.”

Three other stores carrying 

tobacco products in Ann Arbor 
declined to comment for this 
story when approached by Daily 
reporters.

Despite 
the 
protests 
of 

individual cigar and cigarette 
business owners, little evidence 
could be found of a wider 
backlash from the local business 

community.

Andy Labarre, director of 

government relations for the 
Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Chamber 
of Commerce, told the Daily 
in a phone interview that he 
doesn’t expect the regulations 
to significantly affect the local 
economy and that the chamber 
will not take an official position 
on the ordinance.

“I don’t think there’s a notion 

that it’s going to have any 
substantial impact on the local 
economy,” Labarre said. “To be 
frank, it’s more viewed as the 
Ann Arbor City Council acting 
outside its jurisdiction. … That 
happens from time to time.”

Labarre 
also 
added 
that 

no 
local 
businesses 
have 

approached the chamber with 
concerns regarding the new 
restrictions.

Councilmember Grand, who 

initiated the tobacco legislation, 
told the Daily the profit margin 
on cigarette sales and demand 
for 
tobacco 
products 
from 

18-to-21-year-olds is so small 
that she wasn’t concerned about 
any adverse effects on the local 
economy.

“The interest in having the 

‘Tobacco 21’ ordinance isn’t 
about the impact on businesses; 
it’s the impact on the health of 
young people in our community,” 
Grand said. “We did think about 
this impact (on local businesses) 
and determined that any small 
impacts that are made were 
worth it on balance with health 
benefit.”

Grand added that she has 

only faced scattered opposition 
to her legislation from business 
owners; namely from Rosenthal 
and an out-of-town advocacy 
group representing the tobacco 
industry.

Rosenthal said he has been 

approached by a number of 
multi-regional 
law 
firms, 

whose names he declined to 
disclose, seeking to challenge 
the ordinance as a pro-bono 
civil rights case on the basis of 
the ordinance’s contradiction to 
state law. However, he said he is 
still undecided over whether to 
challenge the city in what could 
ultimately be lengthy litigation.

“I really do love this town. 

… I’m not going anywhere,” 
Rosenthal said. “If I take this to 
court, it’s going to cost hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in legal 
fees to the city. Does Ann Arbor 
have the money? Of course they 
do, but it’s kind of a waste … but 
I don’t know (if I will sue), it’s 
going to be a moral decision.”

Senior defender Madisson Lewis anchored the Wolverines’ backline last season.
Notebook: Michigan begins its 
preseason against top-10 teams

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Summer Managing Editor

The Michigan women’s soccer 

team has tended to play locally 
when it comes to preseason 
exhibition 
matches. 
The 

Wolverines have a strong record 
coming off the first week of 
training — winning four of their 
last five exhibition matches by 
outscoring opponents 17-3 in the 
last four seasons — allowing them 
to ease into the regular season.

This year, though, Michigan 

took an alternative approach 
and pitted its talent against 
the Big East and Atlantic Coast 
Conference. 
With 
fall 
camp 

beginning Aug. 3, the Wolverines 
had a quick turnaround to prepare 
for two of the top programs in the 
country in No. 6 West Virginia 
and No. 4 Virginia.

Saturday before the team’s 

media 
day, 
redshirt 
junior 

midfielder Ani Sarkisian, one 
of this year’s three captains, 
expressed excitement for playing 
some 
of 
the 
nation’s 
most 

competitive teams ahead of non-
conference play.

“This 
is 

gonna 
be 
all 

in 
for 
those 

90 
minutes,” 

Sarkisian 
said 

Saturday. 
“We’ve 
only 

been 
training 

for three days, 
but we’ve had 
nine 
sessions 

already, so we’re all itching to 
have a little more competition 
than 
just 
playing 
against 

ourselves. It’ll be great to see how 
we compare to these teams, if we 

can keep up.

“If we can pull off a win or a 

tie, it would be really great for us 
confidence-wise as well.”

Monday 
afternoon 
in 

Morgantown, 
W.Va., 
the 

Wolverines 
earned 
that 

confidence 
boost by pulling 
out 
a 
hard-

fought 2-2 tie 
against 
West 

Virginia.

With 

Michigan 
trailing by one 
goal with just 
27 
seconds 

left, 
redshirt 

freshman midfielder Katie Foug 
kicked in the tying goal to give 
the Wolverines a 2-2 tie.

Michigan had struck first in 

the 32nd minute with an upper-

90 goal from senior midfielder 
Jessica 
Heifetz, 
but 
the 

Wolverines let in two quick goals 
shortly 
after 

halftime — one 
of which off a 
penalty kick.

“I 
was 

really 
proud 

of this young 
team,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan to 
MGoBlue after 
the game. “West Virginia’s just 
dangerous. … For us to hang in 
there, connect well, get chances 
in behind their line and then 
come away with a late goal to 
tie it 2-2 is really beyond what I 
expected for today.”

Thursday, Michigan will host 

a demon from its past: Virginia, 
the 
team 
that 
knocked 
the 

Wolverines out of the Elite Eight 
in the 2013 NCAA Tournament. 
This week’s matchup will mark 
just the second time the two 
teams have played each other. 
This time, however, Michigan has 
the home-field advantage.

For senior defender Madisson 

Lewis, another Michigan captain, 
this 
Thursday’s 
exhibition 

is 
personal. 
Lewis 
was 
the 

Wolverines’ 
second-leading 

scorer that season and was a 
starting forward in Michigan’s 
2-1 loss to the Cavaliers.

“It’s gonna be really fun to play 

them at home and hopefully kick 
their butt,” Lewis said.

Wolverines without Timko, 

Yekka 
and 
Sweeney: 
Back 

in May, Ryan announced that 
Michigan would be without three 
critical players this season: junior 
defender Taylor Timko, redshirt 
freshman 
midfielder 
Kelly 
Sweeney 

and sophomore 
defender 
Sura 

Yekka.

Both 
Timko 

and 
Sweeney 

will be out due 
to knee injuries 
suffered in the 
spring 
season, 

with 
Sweeney 

reinjuring the same knee that 
kept her out of the 2015 season. 
Timko, however, may return 
late 
in 
the 
season, 
pending 

rehabilitation and approval of the 
team’s medical staff.

Timko 
has 
been 
a 
huge 

presence up front during the last 
two seasons, and led the team last 
year with seven goals and three 
assists.

As for Yekka — one of Michigan’s 

anchors on the backline — she will 
be training with the Canadian 

U-20 Women’s 
National Team 
in 
preparation 

for 
the 
2016 

FIFA 
U-20 

Women’s World 
Cup from Nov. 
13 to Dec. 3 
in Papua New 
Guinea.

“Taylor, 

Sura and Kelly are tremendously 
talented players, and we will miss 
them, and will definitely feel 
their loss this fall” Ryan said in a 
statement this May.

Though the losses will present 

a new challenge for the team this 
season, Ryan noted that it will 
bring about opportunities for 
younger and returning players to 
compete for those vacant spots.

According to Lewis, the bench 

is as critical to the team’s success 
as those on the field, and she has 
no doubt Sweeney and Timko’s 
input will be heard.

“Taylor will be fine, she’s such 

a positive person in general. Same 
with Kelly,” Lewis said Saturday. 
“We have a very good support 
system as a team. We’re all there 
for each other whenever anyone 
needs it. I think we’ll be fine.”

Nike rings in new era of 

Michigan 
soccer: 
With 
last 

week’s unveiling of the new Nike 
and Jordan Brand apparel at the 
M Den, Michigan is welcoming a 
new era for its athletic program.

On Aug. 19, the women’s soccer 

program will be the first of 
Michigan’s 27 varsity programs 
to sport the Nike swoosh in a 
game.

“It’s 
pretty 

nice clothing,” 
Lewis Said. “We 
kind 
of 
joke, 

‘Look 
good, 

feel good, play 
good.’ I don’t 
know, 
that 

probably 
plays 

into it a little 
bit. Our jerseys 
are really cool, 
we 
feel 
more 

confident… a little mental thing.” 
 

Added Sarkisian: “You’re with 

a new company, you get all this 
new gear, you have all this nice 
stuff on, you better be playing 
well. … It’s really rallying the 
Michigan fans and starting a new 
era. It’s nice to know we’re the 
beginning of that, and we can 
have an impact on that and make 
history if we choose to.”

“We’re all 

itching to have 

a litte more 
competition.”

“It’s rallying the 
Michigan fans 
and starting a 

new era.”

“I was really 
proud of this 
young team.”

Junior Moe Ways is one of several Michigan receivers looking to earn more playing time. 
‘M’ looks for third breakout receiver

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

After nearly 20 minutes of 

questions about his team’s ongoing 
quarterback competition at the 
Wolverines’ 
team 
media 
day 

Sunday, Michigan passing game 
coordinator Jedd Fisch broke into 
a wide grin when a reporter finally 
broached the subject of his other 
position group.

“Thank you for that question,” 

Fisch said, barely exaggerating his 
excitement. “All these questions 
about quarterbacks all the time 
— we’ve got pretty good receivers 
around here!”

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

receiving corps still has no idea who 
will be throwing them the ball this 
season — whether it be redshirt 
sophomore Wilton Speight, redshirt 
junior 
John 
O’Korn, 
or 
even 

redshirt junior Shane Morris — the 
group is strong at the top and, more 
importantly, deeper than it has been 
in years.

Fresh off a season in which he 

led Michigan with 58 catches, 
fifth-year senior Amara Darboh 
has ridden what Fisch called “an 
incredible offseason” to take the 
lead as the No. 1 receiver. Fellow 
fifth-year senior Jehu Chesson — 
who would have been right in the 
conversation if he hadn’t partially 
torn his posterior cruciate ligament 
at the very end of last season — is 
now fully healthy and will line up 
opposite Darboh, looking to top his 
breakout 2015 season in which he 
tallied a team-high 764 yards and 
nine touchdowns.

“I think going into last year at 

this time, we didn’t have many 
conversations about Jehu,” Fisch 
said. “The way he evolved, the way 
he developed, how hard he worked 
and what he ended up doing for 
our program — on special teams, 
on offense, running the football on 
some reverses and sweeps, and as a 
leader? Unbelievable.”

Adding in senior All-American 

tight end Jake Butt, the Wolverines’ 
top three targets are set in stone. But 
with a spot as a third receiver up for 
grabs and plenty of young talent on 
the roster, Fisch’s lesser-scrutinized 
position group remains extremely 
competitive.

According to Fisch, the receiver 

to beat heading into fall camp is 
sophomore Grant Perry. Despite 
starting off last season struggling 
to get on the same page as then-
starting quarterback Jake Rudock, 
Perry recovered to finish his 
freshman campaign with 14 catches 
and 128 yards — not overwhelming 
numbers, but by far the most 
production of any wide receiver not 
named Darboh or Chesson.

Perry’s 
spot 
is 
far 
from 

guaranteed, 
though. 
According 

to Fisch and Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh, junior Moe Ways was 
having a stellar spring camp before 
breaking his foot, and he is now 
healthy again for fall camp, so he 
could be ready to pick up where he 
left off in March.

“I’m hoping that I can be that 

next guy,” Ways said. “I’m working 
toward that, and I think just with 
hard work and getting better every 
day, that goal is attainable.”

And redshirt sophomore Drake 

Harris, once a highly touted recruit 

who has suffered through a slew 
of injuries to his hamstrings and 
ankle, will be looking to take on a 
bigger role as well.

With the top two receivers 

having set the standard, their 
less-established counterparts see 
no reason why they can’t be the 
Wolverines’ next breakout star.

If no veteran receiver steps up, 

Michigan also has plenty of new 
faces with high potential. Freshman 
Ahmir Mitchell enrolled early last 
winter and turned some heads 
with his play when the Wolverines 
traveled to Florida for practice 
during spring break. Additionally, 
a fresh crop of talented receivers 
arriving in the fall — including 
Kekoa 
Crawford 
and 
Eddie 

McDoom — could mean that 
someone will follow Perry’s lead 
and earn immediate playing time.

Much like at quarterback, the 

competition for the third wide 
receiver slot remains wide open. 
And with increased expectations 
for the team as a whole — Michigan 
checked in at No. 8 in the preseason 
coaches’ poll last week — no one is 
taking the battle lightly.

“I feel like there’s always gonna 

be 
expectations 
coming 
from 

Michigan,” Harris said. “When 
you’re one of the top teams in the 
country, coaches are expecting you 
to go out there and do big things on 
the field.

“There’s 
gonna 
be 
tons 
of 

competition. We have a lot of depth, 
and obviously Jehu and Darboh 
have their spots, but that third 
wide receiver position is open and 
someone needs to step in there and 
take it.”

Slimmer Charlton 
hoping to be ‘bullet’

By ORION SANG 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Ask Taco Charlton if he’d rather 

be a slug or a bullet — like his 
defensive coordinator Don Brown 
did — and you’ll get a laugh out of 
the senior defensive end.

Like most, Charlton would 

prefer to be the bullet, though his 
performance as the proverbial 
“slug” last season certainly wasn’t 
lacking.

Despite 

starting 
just 

three 
games, 

Charlton 
managed 
to 

tally 8.5 tackles 
for loss and 5.5 
sacks as an end in 
former defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 
Durkin’s 

3-4 
defense. 

The numbers with such limited 
snaps are even more impressive 
considering injuries along the 
defensive line forced Charlton to 
play as both a tackle and an end.

As a result, Charlton had to 

carry 
more 

weight 
to 
be 

better equipped 
to handle the 
opposition’s 
running 
game — hence 
Brown’s playful 
comparison.

But under his 

new 
defensive 

coordinator’s 
system, Charlton 
is back to being the bullet, having 
lost 13 pounds this offseason. 
Heading into fall camp, Charlton’s 
weight is listed on the roster at a 
still-formidable 272 pounds.

That weight on a hulking 6-foot-

6 frame that has spent close to four 
years in a college weight room 
could be a nightmare for offensive 
lines this season — which is 
Charlton’s goal.

“Going to a 4-3 defense kinda 

suits my game a lot, because 
it puts me outside where I can 
use a lot of my speed,” Charlton 
said at Sunday’s team media day. 
“Going back to a 4-3 end, I believe 
my production is only going to 
skyrocket. It wasn’t necessarily 

bad weight that I had on last year, 
but it was baggage I didn’t need 
and (the weight loss) allowed me 
to be a lot faster off the edge and 
get the speed that I really wanted 
back.

“That speed coming off the edge 

is something that our team needs, 
and (Brown) wants me to be that 
pass rusher that we need. That’s 
what I’m going to be capable of 
bringing.”

Charlton 

has 
enjoyed 

learning under 
Brown 
— 
a 

coach 
with 

a 
penchant 

for 
bringing 

pressure with 
all 
kinds 
of 

blitzes.

That, 

Charlton 
explains, 

allows the defensive line to be free.

“One of the worst things is when 

you have to contain the whole 
time,” Charlton said. “You can’t 
really rush (the passer) because 
you’re so afraid of the quarterback 

getting 
out. 

But 
with 

coach 
Brown, 

he blitzes so 
much. 
As 
a 

rusher, 
when 

you hear that, 
you’re 
really 

able 
to 
pin 

your ears back 
and go get the 
quarterback.”

That’s not to 

say Charlton isn’t willing to flex 
back inside if asked. He’s adamant 
in saying that he’ll do anything 
to help his team win, and if that 
means having to flip back-and-
forth between positions, so be it. 
He has played pretty much every 
position on the line in his career 
— strong side, weak side, rush end 
and tackle.

“So 
I’m 
really 
capable 
of 

going back and forth and playing 
wherever my team needs, and I’m 
able to do it and be productive 
at it,” Charlton said. “If a coach 
moves me inside, I can definitely 
rush (the passer). I’ve got the speed 
to do it, and I’m strong enough to 
do it.”

FOOTBALL

Charlton 

recorded 5.5 

sacks in limited 
time last year.

“(Coach Brown) 
wants me to be 
that pass rusher 
that we need.”
