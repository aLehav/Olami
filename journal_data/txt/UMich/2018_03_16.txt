ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

WICHITA, Kan. — Michigan 

and Montana stood around, 
waiting for action to restart.

There was a shot clock 

malfunction with just under 
17 minutes to play in the 
second half, and it took an 
extraordinarily 
long 
amount 

of time to get it working again. 
When the shot clock did start 
ticking properly again, the game 
paused again moments later for 
the under-16 media timeout.

The pauses, coupled with 

sloppy play all around, were 
enough to make the game feel 
tired.

In the end, it didn’t matter for 

the Wolverines (13-5 Big Ten, 
29-7 overall). They sleepwalked 
their way to a 61-47 win to earn 
a matchup against sixth-seeded 
Houston on Saturday.

Things couldn’t have started 

much worse for Michigan.

In the first few seconds, senior 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman got called for a foul 
before junior forward Moritz 
Wagner turned it over. Over the 
next few minutes, sophomore 
guard Zavier Simpson picked up 
two fouls and was relegated to 
the bench, while the Wolverines 
turned it over again.

Oh, and they didn’t score a 

point.

Even still, fifth-year senior 

guard Jaaron Simmons — who 
filled in when Simpson came 
out — and redshirt sophomore 
wing Charles Matthews did just 
enough to give Michigan a three-
point lead at the halftime break.

The grogginess of the whole 

game 
showed 
through 
on 

the court for the Wolverines. 
The fire and swagger they 

normally possess — and had 
possessed over the final stretch 
of their season as they won nine 
consecutive games — was almost 
completely absent.

Wagner, the team’s leading 

scorer, had just 5 points all game. 
Simpson didn’t have the same 
dynamic control of the offense 
he’s shown down the stretch of 
the season, scoring just 5 points 
while turning it over a couple 
times in transition.

If Montana had mounted any 

sort of offensive threat at all, 
Michigan might have been in 
trouble.

But the Grizzlies were even 

more useless with the ball in 
their hands. They shot 33 percent 
from the floor and turned the 
ball over 11 times themselves. 
During the stretch when the 
clock broke and nobody seemed 
to know how to fix it, Montana 
was in the stretch of a scoring 
drought that nearly reached ten 
minutes before Ahmaad Rorie’s 
3-pointer with 9:30 left.

Beyond the contributions of 

Michael Oguine and Rorie, the 
Grizzlies’ two leading scorers, 
the rest of the team combined 
for 14 total points.

At the end of the game, the 

clocks 
mercifully 
crawled 

toward zero. What remained 
of the 14,000 people who once 
filled 
the 
stands 
aimlessly 

meandered their way out of the 
arena.

Some of them will come back 

Saturday to see the Wolverines 
take on the Cougars in the 
second round. It might be tough 
for them to remember exactly 
how 
Michigan 
got 
there, 

because for parts of Thursday 
night’s game, both literally and 
figuratively, it seemed like time 
was standing still.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily

Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis and LSA freshman Morgan McCaul discuss the power of victim impact statements in Larry Nassar’s prosecution at 
Hutchins Hall Thursday. 

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Morgan McCaul, Assistant AG Angela Povilaitis discuss effect of victim impact statements

Despite daunting barriers to 

reporting, nearly 300 survivors 
have come forward with stories 
of the assault they suffered at the 
hands of Larry Nassar, former USA 
Gymnastics and Michigan State 
University doctor. Angela Povilaitis, 
assistant 
attorney 
general 
of 

Michigan, served as an advocate 
for many of these women over the 
course of a week during Nassar’s 

January sentencing trial in Ingham 
County Court. Thursday afternoon, 
Povilatis — accompanied by LSA 
freshman and survivor Morgan 
McCaul — spoke at the University 
of Michigan Law School on the 
use of victim impact statements 
during the Nassar trials. Povilaitis 
explained victim impact statements 
are not simply powerful for the 
survivors, but have transformed 
the way perpetrators of sexual 
assault are being prosecuted.

Originally, 90 women were 

scheduled to give victim impact 
statements 
during 
Nassar’s 

sentencing. 
However, 
as 
the 

momentum 
and 
support 
for 

survivors 
grew, 
more 
women 

reached out to Povilaitis, asking 
to tell their stories of abuse. 
156 women in total gave their 
statements for Nassar — and the 
world — to hear.

Povilaitis 
highlighted 
how 

unique this case was considering its 
length, breadth, the nature of the 
crime and the number of victims 
who spoke and came forward –– 
about 260 to 300 survivors in total.

“(Sexual assault cases) are the 

most difficult cases to prosecute, 

there’s an inherent skepticism, 
there’s societal victim blaming, 
there’s various myths about how 
rape and sexual assault victims 
are supposed to act and behave 
and disclose,” Povilaitis said. “This 
sentencing hearing will shift that.” 

She went on to explain she 

could have brought charges for 
all 250 survivors at the time. 
However, she chose to only bring 
charges for 10, as it would not 
only be difficult and prolonged to 
evaluate 250 individual cases, but 
also unnecessary with Nassar’s

In Nassar’s wake, prosecutor and 
survivor see shift in assault cases

When LSA freshman Shelby 

Alston received a full scholarship 
to the University of Michigan, she 
began to consider how she might 
factor housing into her life at the 
University. Hailing from Royal 
Oak and Alston was working a job 
in Auburn Hills, she didn’t want 
to sacrifice her job to come to Ann 
Arbor. Alston decided commuting 
from home would be the best way 
to ensure she would be able to 
keep doing the work she loves.

Each weekday, Alston makes 

the 
90-minute 
commute 
to 

campus, the first hour driving 
her own personal vehicle and — 
after parking at the Plymouth 
Road Park & Ride Lot — the last 
30 minutes riding the public bus. 
While the lengthy commute can 
often be an inconvenience, Alston 
explained, it’s the refund check 
she receives from a part of the 
University’s original room and 
board cost that allows her to pay 
her travel expenses.

“If I don’t use the money for 

room and board, they give a 
portion of it back to me in a refund 
check, which I use for gas,” Alston 
said. “It worked out really well.”

According to the Office of 

Financial Aid, the estimated 
on-campus 
room 
and 
board 

cost for in-state freshmen and 
sophomores is $11,198. University 
spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen 
wrote in an email interview 
benefits 
and 
resources 
like 

Alston’s 
commuter 
allowance 

plays a large role in reducing 
financial strains for students who 
choose to commute to campus.

“Students who commute will 

reduce room and board costs 
significantly,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“The allowance for commuting 
students is $4,814 for the academic 
year to acknowledge ongoing 
family household expenses (food, 
utilities, etc.) and transportation 
costs.”

Though Alston has enjoyed the 

advantages of being a commuter 
student — financial advantages 
along with the ability to use the 
public bus system for free as a 

student of the University — she 
said easier access to parking 
near University buildings would 
be most helpful in ensuring 
accessibility for students who 
choose to commute and save their 
financial aid for other expenses.

“Sometimes I feel as though 

it’s kind of a community that’s not 
thought of as much,” Alston said. 
“We’re not really accommodated 
for, which is understandable — 
there’s such a small percentage of 
students who commute. I think it 
would be tremendously beneficial 
for the school to offer on-campus 
parking.”

According 
to 
Broekhuizen, 

the University currently does 
not keep track of data on the 
commuter student population, the 
number of students that commute 
or the reasons they decide to 
commute. This lack of data is 
what some commuter students 
believe could serve as a pipeline to 
creating better resources for their 
commutes.

Business sophomore Subhan 

Chaudry lived on campus his 
freshman year, but later decided 
to commute from home, about 

Following 
Wednesday’s 
gun 

safety rally and walkout hosted by 
the Washtenaw Youth Initiative, 
members 
of 
the 
Washtenaw 

County 
community 
gathered 

Thursday night to discuss what 
more can be done in the fight 
for gun control. Jeanice Kerr 
Swift, 
superintendent 
of 
Ann 

Arbor Public Schools, introduced 
the event, acknowledging and 
applauding the activist work of 
students in the area.

“We 
respect 
the 
First 

Amendment rights of our students 
in Ann Arbor schools, and I am so 
impressed with their knowledge, 
with their conviction, with their 
ability to critically think and to 
articulate what their generation 
is feeling right now in our public 
schools,” Swift said.

Swift also apologized on behalf 

of adult community members on 
their inability to effectively prevent 
the shootings taking place in 
schools across the country.

“I feel very sorry that as adults, 

we have not been able to solve the 
problem of safety in our schools,” 
Swift said. “I know that many

Former state Rep. Rashida 

Tlaib has been first in many 
arenas over her lifetime. She 
was the first of 14 children, born 
and raised in Detroit by her 
Palestinian immigrant parents. 
After attending law school on 
the weekends while working 
during the week, Tlaib became 
the first Muslim woman elected 
to the Michigan legislature. She 
served as a state representative 
for six years and then worked 
as a public interest lawyer at the 
nonprofit Sugar Law Center for 
Economic and Social Justice for 
the following three years.

Now, Tlaib is onto her next 

first: the first Muslim woman 
elected to Congress. In early 
February, Tlaib announced she 
was running for Congress, vying 
for the seat vacated by former 
Rep. John Conyers Jr., who 
resigned in December.

“It 
is 
something 
that 
is 

inspiring to many people – even if 
you’re not Muslim – to know that 
a girl like me who grew up poor in 
south Detroit, who didn’t speak 
English when I started school,

of you feel the same way. It’s 
regretful 
that 
this 
problem 

continues to worsen and that 
we’ve allowed that to continue.”

The event hosted at Pioneer 

High School involved a panel 
of student activists spanning 
different parts of Washtenaw 
County. Pioneer had the most 
student 
representatives, 
but 

students 
from 
Lincoln 
and 

Skyline 
High 
Schools 
were 

present 
as 
well. 
All 
were 

members of the Washtenaw 
Youth Initiative, a student-based 
organization aiming to create 
gun law reform. Throughout 
the town hall, the students 
tackled topics such as the Second 
Amendment, voter apathy and 

what policies they want to 
change.

Pioneer junior Sarah Lewis 

described her alarm after hearing 
the news of the Parkland, Fla. 
shooting at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School. 
She 

immediately thought of friends 
she had in the south Florida 
area, and said she saw posts on 
Instagram honoring the Parkland 
victims even before the names 
had been officially announced. 
She urged the audience to think 
about the effect gun violence has 
on them, even if they haven’t been 
personally involved in a shooting.

“I have friends who are 

hurting, and I am hurting along 
with them,” Lewis said. “I don’t 
say this for condolences because 
I never personally knew the 
victims myself. I say it to remind 
you all that this is not so far away. 
There aren’t so many degrees 

of separation. This could have 
easily been our reality.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

students and faculty members 
have 
had 
similar 
reactions 

of shock and alarm to the 
Parkland shooting, prompting 
them to think even more about 
shooter 
preparedness 
and 

prevention. Campus members 
have 
previously 
called 
for 

improvements to the emergency 
alert program and harsher gun 
control legislation.

Skyline senior Liam Keating 

echoed 
the 
University’s 

sentiments for reform. He said 
Washtenaw Youth Initiative’s 
two largest policy proposals are 
banning assault-style weapons 
and 
raising 
the 
minimum 

age for gun purchases to 21. 
He 
emphasized 
his 
belief 

these 
demands 
should 
be 

comparatively 
bipartisan 
in 

the grand scheme of the gun 
control debate.

“These are supported by 

huge 
majorities,” 
Keating 

said. “So I want you to 
understand that this is a pretty 
moderate 
position. 
We’re 

not trying to push the nation 
where it doesn’t want to go. 
Considering these majorities 
and 
considering 
that 
our 

nation is a democracy, it seems 
unthinkable that these policies 
aren’t in place.”

Pioneer junior Clara Núñez-

Regueiro 
credited 
activist 

movements from the past 
for the widespread support 
and passion surrounding the 
current student gun control 
movement. She specifically 
noted the 1960s civil rights 
movement, Chicano student 
walkouts, die-ins during the 
AIDS crisis and the Black 
Lives Matter movement and 
their struggles and abilities to 
establish a base of activism to 
build upon.

“We’re really here due 

to the efforts of all these 
people,” 
Núñez-Regueiro 

said. “As students, parents and 
educators, it means a lot that 
you’re here to continue that 
legacy.”

As 
of 
last 
year, 
the 

University’s 
Counseling 

and 
Psychological 
Services 

reported 
the 
University’s 

student-to-counselor ratio sits 
at about 1,200-to-1. Lincoln 
senior 
Max 
McNally 
sees 

similar disparities reflected in 
his high school and brought 
mental health issues into the 
gun 
control 
conversation, 

mentioning the extremely low 
social worker-to-student ratio 
at Lincoln.

“My school has about 1,200 

students and we have three 
social workers in the school,” 
McNally said. “That’s not okay 
for that school or for any school 
in general. We’ve seen too 
many suicides in recent years 
and there’s no clear, equitable 
access to services to tackle 
mental health issues.”

Pioneer junior Seraphina 

Botero said she attended the 
event because of her passion for 
the movement and her belief in 
the panelists’ platform. She said 
she thought the community 
aspect of the event was vital 
to the movement, especially in 
discounting 
misconceptions 

other people may have.

“I think it’s important 

because I knew that there 
were some misconceptions 
that kids in the Washtenaw 
Youth 
Initiative 
were 

being 
controlled 
by 
the 

administration or the face 
of a campaign that is piloted 
by adults,” Botero said. “But 
by actually having a formal 
dialogue 
with 
members 

of the community, we’re 
enabling us to open up and 
not only accept help, but 
answer questions.”

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, Business freshman 
Shannon Ors, with LSA freshman Elizabeth Lawrence, wrote a 
series on the issues facing undocumented students.

“I worked on the three-part series with Elizabeth Lawrence where 
we chronicled the current situation with undocumented students 
both here on campus and nationally. We looked at their status, their 
security on campus, and their outlook for the future. I think one of the 
most interesting things I took away from reporting on DACA students 
was the conversations I had with some students on campus who had 
DACA status and just the challenges that they have to consider when 
they are graduating from the University go beyond securing a job. It 
is the challenge of if an employer will even accept their DACA status, 
and the past four years they have worked toward getting a degree, 
will that even be able to be used in the United States? And that fear is 
something that students who are citizens do not have to worry about, 
so that was a really humbling experience and also a super important 
thing that the student body should know about.”

undocumented students enter uncharted territory”

with a faith that is literally being 
targeted every single day by not 
only this administration but the 
media, could run and win and 
make history,” Tlaib said in an 
interview with Detroit News.

Tlaib 
joins 
a 
competitive 

candidate field in the 13th 
district. Among her opposition 
include Conyers’s 27-year-old 
son, John Conyers III and his 
great-nephew, state Sen. Ian 
Conyers.

Aside from her career, Tlaib 

is occupied fulfilling the duties 
of a mother to her two sons. The 
Daily sat down with Tlaib to 
discuss a typical day in her life 
as both candidate and mother, 
which 
involves 
balancing 

attending meetings with making 
lunches 
and 
laundry 
with 

campaign calls.

“I’m a mom,” Tlaib said. “A lot 

of it is obviously balancing my 
children and their needs with 
being able to get the campaign 
moving.”

A day in Tlaib’s busy life may 

look something like this:

5 a.m.: She rises early to catch 

up on writing thank you notes 
that need to be sent.

7 a.m.: Tlaib makes sure her 

kids are awake and getting ready 
for school in the morning. She 
often reviews the daily schedule 
with them, so that they know 
who will be picking them up 
from school and what the 
evening agenda is going to look 
like. After breakfast, she and 
the boys head out the door for 
school.

9 a.m.: In the mornings, Tlaib 

likes to do some form of cardio 
for daily exercise.

10:30 a.m.: Tlaib usually starts 

holding meetings around 10:30 
or 11 a.m. This often involves 
meeting with precinct delegates 
and members throughout the 

12 different cities in Michigan’s 
13th congressional district.

12 p.m. to 5 p.m.: During the 

afternoons, Tlaib is out the door 
and running from the office to 
meetings until the evening. She 
typically goes into the office and 
works to raise money for the 
campaign. Tlaib often travels 
to meet directly with people 
across the district.

6 p.m.: In the evening, Tlaib 

returns home to make dinner 
for the family and lunches for 
the boys for the next day.

But no day in the life of 

Tlaib is the same, and she often 
compromises between her roles 
as both a politician and a mom.

“Even 
yesterday, 
my 
son 

didn’t have school, my youngest, 
so it was kind of a laundry day,” 
Tlaib said. “So I made campaign 
calls while I did laundry for my 
D.C. fundraiser.”

Tlaib, as the eldest of 14 

children, is accustomed to the 
act of juggling her personal and 

professional lives.

“Juggling a lot of family with 

work and school is something 
I’ve done,” Tlaib said. “Even 
when I was earning my law 
degree, I worked full time 
Monday through Friday and 
then took weekend classes for 
three years. It wasn’t fun, but I 
think my grandmother and my 
mom pretty much instilled in 
me that you just get it done.”

Tlaib clearly applies this same 

ambition and time management 
to her current life.

“Now, I’m leaving a little bit 

early to go to parent-teacher 
conferences at 4 p.m. and then 
dropping off my two boys at 
drama camp and then heading 
back in for a cabinet meeting at 
7 p.m.,” Tlaib said.

Tlaib’s 
campaign 
involves 

constant communication and 
conversations with Michigan 
citizens, which motivate and 
propel her the most.

“There 
is 
a 
lot 
of 

communication, a lot of direct 
human contact with people 
throughout 
the 
districts,” 

Tlaib said. “That is something 
actually I get a lot of energy 
from, is talking to people. It’s 
more of the traveling and some 
of the logistics for events and 
things that I’m really blessed to 
have an incredible team that’s 
more than happy to take that 
on.”

While Tlaib is energized by 

running for Congress, she has 
encountered 
some 
pushback 

due to her gender and ethnicity. 
She 
describes 
experiencing 

heightened public scrutiny on 
her appearance and actions as a 
woman.

“That’s one thing I don’t miss, 

having this kind of microscope 
on how I look and how I say 
things,” Tlaib said.

10 minutes from Central Campus. 
He 
explained 
having 
more 

information on the commuter 
student population or following 
patterns of other state universities 
would help the University better 
acknowledge 
students 
who 

commute from home.

“I think even looking at the 

state of Michigan in general, most 
of the other colleges in the area, 
even if you look at Michigan State 
or Wayne State and a couple of 
those places, have better programs 
built in for helping students 
navigate that space and having 
spots available for them … where 
it’s more convenient,” Chaudry 
said. “U-M doesn’t really have 
as much in comparison to them, 
and I know a lot of schools also 
track more heavily how many 
students (commute) so they can 
focus on whether they need to put 
funding towards things like that. 
I think that’s one thing that (the 

University) can probably improve 
on.”

Other state universities, such 

as Eastern Michigan University, 
Michigan 
Technological 

University, Northern Michigan 
University 
and 
Ferris 
State 

University, 
currently 
offer 

programs, presentations or other 
resources for commuter students. 
According to University Logistics, 
Transportation 
and 
Parking, 

student parking permits are only 
available to students with junior 
standing and above. Typically, 
junior and seniors would be most 
likely to live in Ann Arbor but, 
according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, the median rent in the city 
has risen 14 percent from 2010 to 
2015, showing a considerable cost 
to upperclassmen who chose to live 
off-campus instead of commute.

For freshmen and sophomores 

like Alston and Chaudry, student 
storage permits are offered but 
are allocated on a first-come-
first-served basis and only 180 
permits are distributed per year. 
The two storage permit lots, one 

on North Campus near Baits I 
Residence Hall and one on South 
Campus on State Street, accept 
the same permit but if one lot is 
full, a student must park at the 
other. LTP suggests commuters 
utilize alternative transportation 
methods such as bicycles, the Park 
and Ride program Alston utilizes 
and more for students who may not 
be able to secure a parking permit.

Broekhuizen 
offered 
LTP’s 

resources but could not comment 
on further parking resources for 
commuter students at the time of 
publishing.

When it comes to what actions 

the University could take to better 
accommodate commuter students, 
Chaudry agreed with Alston that 
more accessible parking lots for 
newer students or cheaper parking 
passes would allow for greater 
ability to take advantage of the 
benefits of being a commuter 
student.

“I think more parking spaces, 

or at least more permits available 
to purchase (would be beneficial), 
because it’s kind of difficult to go 

and navigate finding someone 
who lives in an apartment and has 
a spot available, and if you do it’s 
usually like 15 minutes away from 
wherever the normal classes are so 
it makes it kind of inconvenient,” 
Chaudry said. “For some people, 
it’s even further.”

LSA sophomore Yara El-Tawil, 

who makes the commute from 
her family’s home in Ann Arbor, 
expressed similar sentiments in the 
hope that finding more convenient 
parking might take away certain 
worries about commuting.

El-Tawil currently rents a 

parking spot a few blocks from 
campus, and while she explained 
the price for this is significantly 
lower than what she would pay 
for on-campus living, commuting 
for students who aren’t familiar 
with 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
area 

could be made much easier 
with more accessible parking 
and 
information 
on 
public 

transportation opportunities.

“The biggest thing I would 

say that I wish the University did 
do is make it easier for people to 

commute,” El-Tawil said. “I know 
for some commuters it’s hard to 
figure out the public transportation 
system, and I have an advantage 
because I’ve lived in Ann Arbor 
for 14 years so I know it, but a lot 
of people don’t and I wish that (the 
University) did (emphasize it), or 
if they do do it they’re not doing a 
good job of emphasizing it.”

In terms of the community 

of commuter students, El-Tawil 
explained current dialogue about 
commuting, that it might be 
difficult to do or it might place a 
strain on student social life, should 
be changed. She expressed her 
hope the University provides more 
information 
about 
commuting 

to students interested in saving 
money or commuting for other 
reasons that making the commute 
from home is not as difficult as 
some might think.

“It’s mainly not a commuter 

campus, which is hard,” El-Tawil 
said. 

combined 
federal 
charges 
for 

possession of child pornography 
for sexual abuse, his consecutive 
sentences imprison him for an 
additional 40 to 175 years on top 
of his 60-year federal sentence. 
Povilaitis also explained these 10 
cases were specifically selected in 
an effort to include survivors from 
outside of Michigan.

For those survivors outside of 

the 10 pressing charges, Judge 
Rosemarie Aquilina allowed for an 
unprecedented amount of victim 
impact statements. Many judges, 
including Aquilina herself, have 
previously limited the duration, 
content or number of victim 
impact statements allowed, which 
contributed to the culture of 
silencing survivors. For Nassar’s 
sentencing, 
however, 
Aquilina 

allowed for any survivor to speak, 
and even applauded them for doing 
so — creating a controversy on its 
own.

“It was very refreshing to see 

a judge who acknowledged their 
pain and suffering, listened with a 
kind ear, and I think it was really 
effective in their healing process,” 
Povilaitis said.

The 
momentum 
of 
the 

testimonies that originally made 
national headlines, however, is now 
up against institutional barriers. 
The Michigan Association of State 
Universities — a coalition including 
the University — succeeded in 
scaling back legislation in the state 
legislature increasing resources for 
survivors. The association claimed 
the package of bills would have 
a “profound impact” on schools. 
Interim 
MSU 
president 
John 

Engler angered many surivors on 
Thursday with comments accusing 
the state bills of interfering in 
mediation 
between 
MSU 
and 

parties suing the university. In his 
testimony before the state Senate 
higher education subcommittee, 
Engler also noted MSU’s legal fees 
would be sourced from taxpayers 
and students.

aMplify platform accommodates student safety

Healthy minds at school

SUJAY SHETTY AND MATTHEW WILLIAMS | LETTER TO THE EDITOR

ALI SAFAWI | COLUMN

E

arlier this semester I 
wrote 
about 
mental 

health care on college 

campuses. But the truth is, 
college might be too late. Half 
of all mental health problems 
begin by age 14.

In 
public 
health, 
we 

think of disease prevention 
as 
having 
three 
levels: 

primary, 
secondary 
and 

tertiary. 
Helping 
students 

manage their mental illness 
to improve their quality of 
life is a classic example of 
tertiary prevention and is a 
worthy endeavor. However, 
more needs to be done to 
prevent mental illness from 
developing in the first place 
(primary 
prevention) 
and 

to detect mental illness as 
soon as possible (secondary 
prevention). For both these 
ventures, we should look to 
schools.

School has gotten more 

stressful 
for 
students. 
A 

report from the Counsel of the 
Great City Schools found that 
students take approximately 
112 
standardized 
tests 

between 
pre-K 
and 
12th 

grade. 
The 
same 
report 

also found that high school 
juniors spend as much as 15 
percent of the school year 
taking 
standardized 
tests. 

The 
pressure 
to 
position 

oneself for college is growing 
and begins far too early.

Palo Alto, Calif., serves as 

an example of the worst-case 
scenario. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the city’s 
youth suicide rate is 14.1 per 
100,000 people. That is almost 
triple the national rate of 5.4 
deaths per 100,000. Extreme 
expectations from parents in 
Palo Alto are at least partially 
responsible for this shocking 
rate. As one parent put it so 
simply but powerfully: “What 
are we doing to our kids?”

The mental health risk 

factors children and teens face 
extend far beyond academics. 
Twenty-eight 
percent 
of 

students in sixth through 12th 
grade report being bullied. 
At home, children can also be 
adversely affected by abuse 
and poverty. In fact, research 
out 
of 
Cornell 
University 

identified a host of mental 
health problems for which 
childhood 
poverty 
lead 
to 

increased 
risk, 
including 

reduced short-term memory 
and antisocial behavior.

It is no surprise that there 

has been public discourse on 
an epidemic of mental illness 

in our schools, a topic that NPR 
ran an excellent special series 
on. Child and teen mental 
illness have real consequences. 
Thirty-seven 
percent 
of 

students with a mental health 
problem drop out of high 
school, a rate higher than for 
any other disability.

In 
the 
wake 
of 
the 

mass shooting at Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 

School, 
President 
Donald 

Trump and some Republican 
lawmakers (including ones in 
Michigan’s state legislature) 
have 
proposed 
arming 

teachers and other school 
staff with firearms. Instead, 
our governments would have 
a much greater impact on the 
lives of students by arming 
schools with knowledge and 
resources to promote good 
mental health.

To 
their 
credit, 
the 

Michigan 
House 
of 

Representatives just passed 
a bill to create an optional 
training program for teachers 
on how to recognize and 
respond to mental illness in 
their students. This is a good 
policy, yet the training is not 
mandatory, nor does the bill 
mandate suicide prevention 
training for teachers as 27 
other states have done. This 
bill needs to be amended 
to fix these flaws before it 
reaches the governor’s desk.

Teachers 
can 
play 
a 

crucial 
role 
in 
both 
the 

primary 
and 
secondary 

prevention of mental health 
problems in students. This 
can be achieved by taking 
measures to reduce stress in 
their classrooms and by being 
aware of and on the lookout for 
the warning signs of mental 
illness. That being said, a 
teacher’s main focus should 
be teaching, as they are not 
mental health professionals. 
School nurses, social workers 
and psychologists must also 
be involved in addressing the 
epidemic.

Per 
the 
American 

Academy of Pediatrics, an 
estimated 
80 
percent 
of 

students seeking help turn 
to schools for mental health 
care. School nurses can play a 
vital role by noticing patterns 
of behavior in students that 
may indicate a mental health 
problem. But they often have 
minimal training in mental 
health 
and 
are 
in 
short 

supply. In fact, Michigan has 
a severe shortage of school 
nurses with a school nurse 
ratio of one nurse per 6,607 
students in 2014, according 
to Parent Action for Healthy 
Kids. In contrast, the federal 
government’s Healthy People 
2020 goals aim for a ratio of 
one nurse per 750 students.

The picture is equally 

troubling 
for 
school 

psychologists. The National 
Association 
of 
School 

Psychologists 
estimates 

a 
shortage 
of 
15,000 

school 
psychologists 
by 

2020. In Michigan, school 
psychologists are on the state 
Department of Education’s 
critical 
shortage 
list, 
a 

designation that incentivizes 
retired 
professionals 
to 

return to work.

If you are considering 

becoming a school nurse or 
psychologist: We desperately 
need you.

It took me four years 

between 
my 
symptoms 

developing and when I first 
sought help for my mental 
health 
problem. 
That 
is 

short 
compared 
to 
the 

average of eight to 10 years 
between symptom onset and 
intervention. Had a teacher 
or school nurse noticed my 
symptoms and referred me 
to the school social worker 
then I could have potentially 
gotten better sooner. I would 
have given anything to have 
had that happen.

Students spend 900 to 

1000 hours in school every 
year. Imagine if parents and 
schools 
came 
together 
to 

reduce 
academic 
pressure 

and 
if 
students 
were 

surrounded by a system of 
teachers, nurses and mental 
health 
professionals 
well-

equipped to help them with 
their problems. We could end 
the epidemic of mental illness 
in our schools.

At stake are the minds and 

futures of our children.

M

y life largely exists 
within my happy 
liberal bubble. I am 

a philosophy and international 
studies student at one of 
the world’s leading public 
universities. I am politically 
active within the Democratic 
Party; nearly all of my friends 
are 
pro-choice, 
liberal, 

feminist 
Democrats. 
And 

anytime you see me walking 
on campus or running on a 
treadmill, chances are high 
that a podcast produced by 
Vox, NPR or Crooked Media 
is playing in my headphones.

For these reasons, I am 

fluent in the way that liberals 
speak. I know that when I’m 
referring to women’s issues, I 
cannot say female because that 
refers to biological sex and not 
chosen gender. I know that we 
call Nazis white supremacists 
and not their chosen name 
“alt-right.” I know that we say 
“survivors” and not “victims,” 
and that when introducing 
myself 
I 
should 
always 

provide my pronouns as well. 
I have no qualms with living 
and speaking in this way — I 
want to be as inclusive and 
intersectional as possible in 
my activism and existence as 
a whole. I have committed to 
a life of feminism and social 
justice advocacy. Therefore, it 
should be the expectation that 
I know how to eloquently and 
correctly speak on the issues.

Most Americans have not 

decided that they want to 
spend their lives advocating 
for these causes. I understand 
that there is privilege in 
not being super politically 
engaged, but there is also 
privilege in our activism and 
our language. After 2016, 
many 
Americans 
came 
to 

realize that it was past time 
to step up and march, speak 
out 
and 
hopefully, 
come 

November, vote. This meant 
that many people who had 
previously 
abstained 
from 

any political affiliation or 
activism were deciding to 
let their voices be heard 
by 
publicly 
opposing 
our 

predator-in-chief. There were 

definitely problems with a lot 
of the new-found Democrats, 
such as the 2017 Women’s 
March, which was marked 
by pussy hats and bourgeois 
white feminism, while women 
of 
color 
and 
transgender 

women 
were 
marginalized 

within 
a 
movement 
they 

founded. So, more seasoned 
activists and SJWs rightly 
resisted their entrance into 
the territory.

It’s March 2018, and we 

have less than eight months 
until the midterms and two 
years 
until 
presidential 

primaries. I desperately want 
Democrats back in charge of 
all branches of government. 
I 
want 
protections 
for 

Dreamers, for the phrases 
“chain 
migration,” 
“repeal 

and replace” and “defund 
Planned Parenthood” to die 
hard, for the State Department 
to be funded and staffed, for 
the White House to be free of 
domestic and sexual abusers, 
for the tax cuts and bank 
de-regulations to end and 
more. But we cannot get this 
critical work done with the 
votes and organizing of the 
far-left activists alone. We 
need to find a way to welcome 
those who have been absent.

I believe the first step to 

this is to be forgiving in our 
language and customs. The 
host of “Stuff Mom Never 
Told You,” Bridget Todd, once 
emphasized “calling in.” I 
think this is a good place to 
start. When someone says 
something that feels a little 
off, maybe even blatantly 
problematic, we can start 
with the assumption that 

they were well-intentioned. 
The 
language 
surrounding 

social issues is legitimately 
hard to learn and understand, 
so 
taking 
30 
seconds 
to 

softly explain why phrasing 
something slightly differently 
would 
be 
more 
inclusive 

might 
be 
a 
useful 
and 

worthwhile approach. But too 
often, the left attacks. There 
is much to be mad about right 
now, but attacking those who 
are on our side feels entirely 
unproductive.

For example, in early 2017, 

Chimimanda Ngozi Adiche 
(yes, the amazing Nigerian-
American 
feminist 
most 

famous for her TED talk and 
novel, “Americanah”), came 
under 
fire 
for 
comments 

she made about transgender 
women. She said, “‘Are trans 
women women?’ My feeling 
is trans women are trans 
women.” To me and others, 
this appeared as though she 
meant trans women are not 
“real” women. If that were 
what she meant, that would 
definitely be a transphobic 
view 
and 
I 
would 
not 

consider her a feminist icon 
any longer. But in clarifying 
her 
comments, 
she 
said 

that all she meant is that 
trans women have different 
experiences than ciswomen, 
but that “cis” had never been 
in her vocabulary before. She 
claimed that the left is guilty 
of “language orthodoxy,” and 
that it is exclusionary.

In that regard, I believe 

she is right. Ngozi Adiche 
is 
a 
Nigerian-American, 

and “cisgender” is a term 
largely used in upper-class, 
Western contexts. Most of 
the language I have been 
talking about is used in these 
contexts. So, if we liberals 
truly aim to de-Westernize 
and to be advocates for the 
lower classes, I don’t think we 
can attack those who do not 
enter liberal circles already 
knowing the language.

I

n a recent op-ed, Charles 
Callis 
took 
a 
brave 

stand 
by 
criticizing 

this years’ Central Student 
Government 
campaigns 
for 

failing to address on-campus 
acts of mass violence. He was 
right to do so. If we are to be 
serious candidates, our team 
must have serious discussions 
on this topic. It is true that 
the University of Michigan 
provides training for its staff 
on addressing these kinds of 
situations and that we have an 
on-campus security presence 
and alert system, but we can do 
better. And we must do better. 

In that vein, the aMplify 

Party Policy Team has revised 
its platform to address this 
deficiency. We must continue 
to 
provide 
support 
for 

programming that ensures all 
entering freshmen can receive 

active attacker training from 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security. Furthermore, we 
plan to create a partnership 
with 
the 
Residence 
Hall 

Association 
and 
University 

Housing 
to 
provide 
active 

attacker training workshops, 
facilitated by DPSS, in every 
residential 
community 
on 

campus. These agenda items 
will be the first discussions 
with University officials and 
other stakeholders that we 
have. Additionally, we will 
charge 
the 
Research 
and 

Polling Commission with the 
task of collecting feedback 
from the participants of these 
workshops, separately from 
DPSS or any other part of the 
University. We will use this 
feedback 
to 
communicate 

potential 
revisions

In a world where even

it is foolish to assume we 
are spared from the harsh

We realize, too, that this

TRUE BLUE | LETTER TO THE EDITOR

O

n 
the 
morning 
of 

March 
14th, 
2018, 

exactly 
one 
month 

after 
the 
horrific 
school 

shooting that claimed 17 lives 
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School in Parkland, Fla., 
the Michigan Daily released 
an Op-Ed addressing the lack 
of attention Central Student 
Government 
campaigns 

were giving to gun violence 
prevention. The author, senior 
Ford student Charlie Callis, 
specifically named five CSG 
campaigns, including True 
Blue, which had failed to 
discuss how they would help 
ensure the safety of students 
at the University of Michigan 
should the tragedy of gun 
violence ever touch campus.

True 
Blue 
would 
like 

to 
thank 
Mr. 
Callis 
for 

calling on Central Student 
Government 
and 
the 

University to take action. It 
is crucial that CSG step up 
and advocate for policies 
that will ensure the safety of 
students.

This is why, last week, 

True Blue added to their 
platform 
that 
we 
will 

advocate 
to 
“establish 
a 

mandatory 
active 
shooter 

training through UMPD for 
all faculty on campus.” We 
find it imperative that our 
faculty be thoroughly trained 
to protect themselves and 
their students in the event of 
an active shooter. We know 
that this is not the definitive 
solution to the issue of gun 
violence 
on 
campus, 
and 

look forward to creating and 
implementing 
additional 

solutions to improve student 
safety on campus.

We 
have 
built 
our 

campaign on using the insight 
of our students in order to 
make 
meaningful 
impact. 

We agree with Mr. Callis 
that we must listen to our 
students in order to make our 
campus a safer place where 
students can learn, thrive 
and know that their Central 
Student Government is taking 
measures to protect them. 
Our priority will always be 
students and their safety: 
physically, 
mentally 
and 

emotionally.

True Blue responds to Charlie Callis

True Blue is a 2018 CSG party.

it so powerfully:

Douglas Adams’s ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’

When I first picked up “The 

Hitchhiker’s 
Guide 
to 
the 

Galaxy,” it was one of those 
nights that doesn’t come with 
any specific days attached. I 
was 10 or 11 years old, lying on 
the floor next to my brother 
in the darkened study of my 
mom’s boyfriend’s apartment 
in 
Jacksonville. 
I 
couldn’t 

sleep.

The fact that I couldn’t 

sleep, in my opinion, had less 
to do with being on the floor 
and more to do with the fact 
that I could hear my mom 
and 
her 
boyfriend 
talking 

downstairs. It was the night 
before 
Thanksgiving 
and 

before 
my 
now-stepfather’s 

birthday, and they were trying 
to have a nice time, just the two 
of them: drinking wine, talking 
in hushed voices on the couch 
and laughing at each other’s 
jokes. This was before they got 
engaged, before I had any idea 
that I would eventually wind 
up making a home for myself in 
Fla. At the moment, I was just 
a kid marooned in the darkness 
of a study, kept awake by my 
own anger and indignation, 
which resurfaced every time 
I heard another sound from 
downstairs.

I had no watch, but it felt 

as 
though 
eternities 
were 

passing, suspended there in the 
darkness next to my sleeping 
brother 
while 
soft 
laughs 

and snatches of conversation 
drifted below me, annoying me 
for no rational reason. I ended 
up resorting to the bookcase, 
which sat against the wall only 
a foot or two away from me. I 
picked out a book at random: 
a smallish paperback with a 
shiny blue cover.

I read until I couldn’t hear 

anything at all.

I had never read anything 

like “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to 
the Galaxy” before, and I don’t 
think I ever have since. I loved 
it at the time because it was 
simply fun to read. The opening 
passage, which explains outer 
space and the position of 
humanity before zooming in 
to focus on a house, felt to me 
like the beginning of some 
broad, galactic fairy tale. The 
book was full of thoughtful, 
omniscient musings on the 
total 
improbability 
and 

absurdity 
of 
the 
universe, 

with language that sounded 
comfortable, as though it were 
possible to acknowledge such 
things and still feel safe and 
self-assured.

And yet it was the characters 

who really stood out to me, 
who stick with me to this 
day. I loved Zaphod, with his 
wildly unpredictable schemes 
and strangely touching quest 
to recover his past self, and 
Marvin, the iconic robot who 
would respond to a question 
like “What’s up?” with “I don’t 
know, I’ve never been there.” 
I was enchanted by Ford, who 
accepts the dangerous and 
the tortuous with matter-of-
fact fairness, and Trillian, the 
spontaneous 
mathematician 

who 
could 
fly 
an 
alien 

spaceship and stand up for 
herself in a room full of men in 
the middle of an apocalypse. I 
identified with all of them in 
turns, but perhaps most of all 
Arthur, who embarks on his 
own journey so haphazardly 
and cluelessly and yet tries to 
do his best at every step of the 
way.

These were characters who 

were faced every day with 
the destructive, nonsensical 
nature of the universe. And 
while they were almost never 
sure of themselves in anything, 

they also remained unfazed. 
They expected nothing specific 
of life, and when life gave them 
exactly that, they didn’t feel 
the need to do anything other 
than stay true to themselves. 
They could get arrested by 
Vogons, thrown back and forth 
through time and space, be 
cornered by soldiers, shot at 
and have their home planets 
destroyed. Marvin would still 
be 
miserable, 
and 
Zaphod 

would still be ridiculously 
over-the-top. In one of the 
climactic scenes, Ford decides 
he’s going to investigate what’s 
going on, and he asks the 
others, “Is no one going to say, 
‘No, you can’t possibly, let me 
go instead?’” When they all 
shake their heads, he says, “Oh 
well,” and stands up and goes 
anyway. Because that’s just 
what Ford would do.

I ended up stealing the 

paperback from my mom’s 
boyfriend and rereading it over 
and over. Eventually, as a gift, 
I received the bound Barnes & 
Noble Classics edition of “The 
Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide,” 
featuring all five books in the 
series plus a short story. I fell 
in love with the way Adams 
could tell a story, deeply clever 
but seemingly effortless. By 
some miracle, each character 
was compelling and dynamic, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 

writing itself really doesn’t 
spend very much time in their 
heads. The story is a comedy 
and an adventure, but it’s also 
surprisingly sad, complex and 
thoughtful. My reaction to any 
given line or scene depends in 
large part on the day, whether 
I’m feeling bored — in which 
case I’ll turn to any given 
page and start laughing — or 
truly down and emotionally 
vulnerable, in which case some 
of the story’s more existential 
preoccupations 
will 
really

BOOKS THAT BUILT US

stick with me.

Maybe this is part of why 

it’s so easy to return to this 
story over and over again. 
It works for any day. I want 
to think like Trillian, react 
like Ford, party like Zaphod, 
love like Arthur. I don’t want 
to feel depressed or wry 
or cynical, but when I am 
feeling it anyway, I want to 
be able to articulate it like 
Marvin.

I still have both copies 

with me, the black and 
gold classic volume and the 
paperback, which is now 
worn, with dog-eared pages 
and a creased spine. I flip 
through them whenever I 
need to drown out the world, 
telling myself, “Hey, it could 
always be worse. My entire 
planet could be destroyed 
— and look, these people’s 
planet was destroyed, and 
they’re 
still 
doing 
OK.” 

Then, eventually, I set the 
book back down and go out 
into my own world again, 
knowing that it will not 
make any sense and that I 
shouldn’t expect too much 
of it, and telling myself not 
to panic along the way.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Friday, March 16, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Who would have thought that 

the rather inconspicuous murder 
of a pizza delivery guy could spark 
a lengthy investigation into the 
British intelligence bureau and 
government? As isolated as those 
two occurrences may seem, it is 
their camouflaged connection that 
immediately becomes the premise 
of the joint BBC and Netflix crime 
procedural “Collateral.”

The 
first 
episode 
of 
the 

four-part series starts out on a 
seemingly unspectacular note, 
as delivery driver Abdullah (Sam 
Otto, “The State”) is chosen — 
notably last minute — to drop off 
a pizza at a London apartment. It 
isn’t until he is murdered in cold 
blood on his run that this appears 
to be a more carefully calculated 
death scheme than a random 
driver swap. From that moment 
on, the show picks up the pace 
and delivers a couple of knockout 
performances 
— 
particularly 

that of Carey Mulligan (“The 
Great Gatsby”) as Kip, the chief 
investigator of the case.

Mulligan, in a role unlike many 

of her usual prim and proper 
characters, 
is 
focused, 
hard-

hitting and inexplicably composed 
as Kip. After all, she reveals 
that this small-town homicide 
has hate-crime written all over 

it. Syrian refugees living in a 
garage, Abdullah and his sisters 
are not only poor and desperate 
for financial assistance but also 
are facing some more global 
implications: 
immigration 
and 

human-trafficking victimization. 
Even 
though 
the 
story 
of 

“Collateral” 
isn’t 
necessarily 

focused solely on her, Mulligan 
manages to give the series some 
much 
needed 
stability 
when 

subplots become overly complex 
and cluttered. She is both easy 
to follow as a character and 
compelling to watch as an actress.

With so many different parties 

being involved in the planning, 
execution 
and 
aftermath 
of 

Abdullah’s murder, “Collateral” 
quickly becomes swamped with 
storylines. 
The 
cursory 
cuts 

between the British government, 

police force and military angles 
were not only visually dizzying 
in their abruptness, but also made 
it difficult to stay on top of the 
sequence of events. While it is a 
intriguing twist to, for once, take a 
crime drama out of the traditional 
police station and interrogation 
room and introduce it to the world 
stage, there was just way too much 
going on.

As muddled as “Collateral” 

gets, its eclectic music selection 
remains a refreshing constant and 
adds some charisma to the most 
lackluster of scenes. Songs from 
the likes of Van Morrison to Queen 
to British reggae-rapper Stefflon 
Don brought rhythm to the dense 
rhetoric and, at times, stole my 
attention completely.

In an attempt to make a political 

commentary on Brexit, Britain’s 
state of immigration laws and the 
inconsistency of law enforcement, 
“Collateral” loses its sense of self 
as a procedural and wades into 
unchartered territory. On paper, 
a crime series that tones down 
the mystery and emphasizes the 
deceitfulness of social institutions 
has the potential to really make a 
statement, but not if its plot is as 
loose and convoluted as this one.

CONCERT REVIEW

There’s an age-old air of humor 

that surrounds the melodrama 
of high school — crushes, flings, 
friends 
who 
aren’t 
friends 

anymore, 
underage 
drinking, 

prom, etc. High school, frankly, 
is a clusterfuck for more people 
than not, and, unfortunately for 
me, I fell into the category of 
clusterfucked-kid-turns-to-emo. 
Out of all the bands I listened to 
in high school, including more 
pop punk than is possibly healthy 
for any individual, few bands 
have stuck with me into my 20s 
the way Sorority Noise has, and 
I’ll always be grateful for the 
lyrics and chords that screwed 
(and continue to screw) my head 
on straight whenever I feel like 
drowning.

This 
past 
Saturday, 
with 

support from Remo Drive and 
Foxx Bodies, Sorority Noise 
played their last Michigan show 
to a sold-out crowd before going 
on hiatus. Their final run of 
dates will be opening up for The 
Wonder Years on their UK run 
in April, and while this news 
comes as a sharp sting to the fans 
they’ve moved through the past 
few years, it was a bittersweet 
opportunity to reflect — during 
and after the show — on just how 
important this band was to so 
many people and to normalizing 
conversation 
around 
mental 

health and suicide.

There’s 
truly 
no 
way 
to 

describe in words the reaction a 

Sorority Noise crowd has when 
frontman Cam Boucher belts 
over the explosive chorus of 
hit single “Using”: “I stopped 
wishing I was dead / Learned 
to love myself before anyone 
else / Become more than just a 
burden!” It was a group effort 
at 
catharsis, 
invisible 
wires 

threading the crowd into an 
amalgamation 
of 
continual 

self-improvement. I’ve shared 
smiles with more strangers at a 
Sorority Noise show than I have 
anywhere else in my entire life, 
experiencing joint happiness in 
knowing that a pop-emo band 
was doing more to make us feel 
alive than anything else.

Regardless of the emotionality 

of the band’s music, there’s also 
no denying that the individual 
musicians that make up Sorority 
Noise are incredible. Guitarist 
Adam 
Ackerman’s 
scattered 

solos pierce through the tight 
punk harmonies and light up the 
crowd; Boucher’s vocals range 
from tender croons to shrill 
screams (often all within the 
course of one song); drummer 
Charlie 
Singer 
and 
bassist 

Ryan McKenna deftly undercut 
the 
melodies 
with 
sporadic 

arrangements. At a Sorority 
Noise show, it’s impossible to 
not feel every little detail poured 
into their music. During their 
performance of Joy, Departed’s 
“Your Soft Blood,” the band 
showcased this talent, ripping 
through the grunge cut with 
intense animosity that silences 
the room by its final line: “Don’t 
chalk me up to anything less than 

sin.”

This is the magic of Sorority 

Noise — a band with the ability 
to write insanely good hooks and 
lyricism that doesn’t shy away 
from topics that are difficult to 
hash out. Each of their three 
records and multiple EPs tackles 
the difficult facets of existing in 
today’s world — the pervasive 
problem of mental health, suicide 
and substance abuse, to name a 
few. Sorority Noise let us know 
that it’s OK to struggle and mess 
up, but they also taught us the 
importance of self-love and self-
forgiveness. Boucher even went 
so far to take time in between 
songs to give a few words of 
kindness 
and 
encouragement 

to his fans, saying of the band’s 
departure, “In the meantime, 
please take care of yourselves.”

A band like Sorority Noise 

doesn’t 
come 
around 
too 

often, and during their encore 
performance 
of 
“Art 
School 

Wannabe,” 
I 
was 
reminded 

of their unique appeal. The 
song encapsulates the band’s 
best 
qualities; 
their 
upbeat 

tempos, 
honest 
lyrics 
and 

tight instrumentation all come 
together to make a perfect song 
about understanding yourself at 
your worst. It’s a joy like no other 
to sing, “I might not be as dark as I 
think,” in a sweaty mosh pit with 
like-minded 
individuals. 
And 

for their music, their activism 
and obviously their therapeutic 
performances, we owe Sorority 
Noise our utmost appreciation 
and can only hope to see them 
back soon.

Sorority Noise delivers a 
phenomenal final show

DOMINIC POLSINELLI / DAILY

CLASSICAL MUSIC COLUMN

Last 
weekend 
something 

very special happened at the 
Ypsilanti Freighthouse. Built 
in 1878, the old building down 
by the tracks was never meant 
to host the sort of event it was 
home to throughout Saturday 
and Sunday, but times change 
and fortunately for us someone 
had the foresight to change the 
structure’s uses with it.

I’m talking, of course, about 

Threads 
All 
Arts 
Festival, 

which, if you haven’t already 
heard, is perhaps one of the 
most exciting cultural events 
to happen in the greater Ann 
Arbor area in recent memory. 
The brainchild of a motley crew 
of 20-somethings mostly out of 
the University, the festival first 
appeared in 2016 as a collection 
of performances and various 
other 
arts 
presentations 
in 

Ann Arbor’s Yellow Barn. Now, 
Threads is back, bigger and 
better than ever.

When I talked to one of 

the festival’s founders, Nicole 
Patrick, before the first iteration 
of the event in 2016, I initially 
had no idea what a wonderful 
thing was about to happen. But 
through what appears to be 
sheer force of will, a fair bit of 
funding through various sources 
like the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance’s EXCEL program and 
a great deal of talent on the 
part of the artists involved in 
the festival, the Threads team 
has been able to pull together 
an event that places the focus 
on one of the most important 

elements of creative culture 
today: local art.

All artists start local. That’s 

just how it works. And the 
ones who end up going beyond 
that, those who reach larger 
and larger audiences, usually 
have some sort of backing from 

their community, whether it’s a 
dedicated fan base, some form 
of funding or a combination of 
both. This sort of relationship 
is helpful to more than just 
the artists — it takes on a 
symbiotic nature fairly quickly, 
strengthening 
both 
the 

individual artists and the larger 
public.

“We really believe that the 

community will feel stronger 
connections to the place that 
they live if they are also aware 
of the artists who live here,” 
Patrick told me in 2016, and I 
certainly agree. But the value 
of 
Threads 
extends 
beyond 

more than just fortifying the 

bonds between artists and their 
community. To me, the festival’s 
most exciting aspect is perhaps 
the integration of art from 
all manner of backgrounds. 
This column is supposed to be 
about classical music — and 
it is, obliquely — but Threads 
incorporates 
things 
from 

everywhere. The walls of the 
Freighthouse were host to a 
variety of visual art, including 
multimedia presentations, and 
in various parts of the building 
people could stop by performers 
reciting 
poetry 
or 
playing 

music. Throughout the festival’s 
two days, there were rockers, 
jazz players, dancers, rappers, 
funk players and (here’s the 
justification for this column) 
classical musicians.

And here’s the thing: The 

same audience was there for it 
all. And sure, the sorts of people 
who buy a ticket to something 
billing itself as an “all arts 
festival” are probably going to 
be fairly open minded when it 
comes to their artistic tastes, but 
nevertheless I feel it’s important 
to talk about how if classical 
music wants to reach a broader 
audience this isn’t a bad way to 
do it. The same group of people 
who danced to a compelling 
performance by Louis Picasso 
and the Gallery on one night 
listened intently to Grey Grant 
and the Front Porch ensemble 
perform original compositions 
out of the classical style the very 
next day.

While I enjoyed everything

I heard at Threads (though I 
sadly didn’t hear as much as 
I would have liked, due to my 
prohibitively 
busy 
schedule), 

the latter performance deserves 
singling 
out. 
An 
emotional 

journey inspired by the ecology 
of Mich. in bygone years, Grey 
Grant managed to craft a work 
that is moving, evocative and, 
by the end, exhausting (in the 
best sense). Their feeling for 
drama and flow led the listener 
along without ever seeming 
to, and the members of Front 
Porch executed the at-times 
demanding music with precision 
and nuance. (Full disclosure: 
Grey is a dear friend of mine, as 
are the members of Front Porch, 

two of whom I live with and all 
of whom have played my own 
music — which is to say that I 
am in no way unbiased in this 

matter).

But the point isn’t that I felt 

these things. It’s that, judging 
from the reaction of the audience 

(a standing ovation), everyone 
else felt them too. And that’s 
how you expand the genre. You 
give people something concrete 
and meaningful to grab onto. 
You give them a reason to 
want to listen. You don’t ask 
them to drag themselves out 
to the concert hall for another 
rendition of Beethoven, or to a 
glamourous night at the opera. 
Let them see the composer and 
let them wear blue-jeans. Let 
them eat food from the venue’s 
vendors while they enjoy the 
performance. And if you do 
nothing else, please — please 
— help break down the walls 
separating classical from the 
rest of the music world.

2018 Baseball Preview

Freshman class looking to provide strong foundation

Last June, Michigan coach 

Erik 
Bakich 
watched 
as 
a 

program-record 11 players were 
drafted to the MLB. It was a 
milestone moment to cap off the 
fifth season of his tenure in Ann 
Arbor that has included five 
winning seasons, two NCAA 
Tournament 
appearances 

and a Big Ten Tournament 
championship.

“We 
want 
everyone 
to 

have the opportunity to play 
professional baseball,” Bakich 
said. “We don’t hide from it, we 
don’t shy away from it. We want 
every player in our program to 
play pro ball.”

While this philosophy may 

be for the long-term benefit of 
the program, the unfortunate 
reality is that it was always 
going to make 2018 a tough 
season for Bakich and his staff.

Even with six of their top 

seven hitters and three-fourths 
of 
their 
starting 
rotation 

departed, 
the 
Wolverines 

could not have anticipated the 
struggles they have endured 
in the first four weeks of 
the 
season. 
Last 
season’s 

tournament berth is now a 
distant memory.

“We’d like to think coming 

into this season that we’ve put 
ourselves into a position to 
reload and not rebuild,” Bakich 
said after a loss to Lipscomb 
last week. “But clearly we’re 
rebuilding right now.”

The hope around Michigan, 

though, is that its rebuilding 
process will be accelerated by 
an acclaimed recruiting class 
that ranked 10th in the nation 
— an all-time best for a Big Ten 
program.

The freshman class includes 

eight of Perfect Game’s Top 
400 from the 2017 class, and is 
headlined by left-hander Ben 
Dragani 
and 
first 
baseman 

Jesse Franklin, the Gatorade 
Players of the Year in Wisconsin 
and Washington, respectively. 
Beyond 
them, 
right-hander 

Jeff Criswell and catcher Joe 
Donovan both turned down 
major league draft offers to 

come to Ann Arbor.

Donovan 
was 
named 
an 

All-American 
by 
Collegiate 

Baseball, 
while 
right-hander 

Blake 
Beers 
was 
All-State 

California 
and 
outfielder 

Jordan Nwogu was All-State 
Michigan. 
The 
acclaimed 

freshmen are joined by junior-
college transfers Blake Nelson 
and Matthew Schmidt.

Their start to life in the 

college 
baseball 
ranks 
has 

not been as rosy. Blomgren 
and Franklin — the only two 
freshmen with over 20 at-bats — 
are both hitting under .200.

“Some of these guys are 

dealing 
with 
adversity 
for 

the first times in their lives,” 
Bakich said, “and we try to have 
a mental game toolbox to go to 
when the garbage is hitting the 
fan but sometimes it’s easier 
said than done.

“They’re 
all 
seeing 
what 

college baseball is all about.”

On 
the 
mound, 
Dragani 

has been a bright spot for the 
freshmen with a 2.77 ERA in 
a team-leading 13.0 innings 
pitched out of the bullpen. After 
giving up two runs in each of 
his first two outings, his recent 

success has catapulted him 
into a relief ace role in pitching 
coach Chris Fetter’s bullpen.

“He’s had success because 

he’s been aggressive with all of 
his pitches in the strike zone,” 
Bakich said. “He’s consistently 
been a strike-thrower every 
time he’s been out there and 
he’s executed the pitch call and 
game plan. He’s done a nice 
job. He’ll continue to get more 
opportunities and may have his 
role expanded.”

The consistency for which 

Bakich praised Dragani has been 
a constant refrain throughout 
the beginning of the season, 
especially on the defensive side, 
where the Wolverines have 
mixed web gems with little 
league errors. This emphasis 
on consistency does not exclude 
the freshmen, who have been 
key contributors to Michigan’s 
erratic play.

Last 
Saturday 
against 

Lipscomb, Blomgren made a 
beautiful diving catch over his 
shoulder before allowing a run 
to score on a bobbled grounder 
four innings later. Franklin, 
meanwhile, went 2-for-4 with 
a run batted-in Wednesday 

afternoon, but came into the 
game just 2-for-21 on the season. 
Criswell has a strikeout in each 
of his four relief appearances 
— three of which have been 
scoreless — but gave up a walk-
off three-run homer at Stanford 
two weekends ago.

Struggling with consistency, 

though, is understandable for 
players with less than a month 
of collegiate baseball under 
their belts.

“You got kids acclimating to 

a lot of different areas,” Bakich 
said. “They’re acclimating to 
school and academics and social 
life and trying to make friends. 
They’re away from home for 
the first time, and now they’re 
trying to play in a very good, 
elite program and it’s a lot of 
balls in the air to juggle at once.”

Added junior shortstop Ako 

Thomas: “Very good group of 
freshmen. I feel like they came 
in and we took them under our 
wing. Very willing to learn, 
always asking questions and 
I feel honored to be able to 
answer some of their questions 
because I was in their situation 
at one point as well, so just being 
a leading figure as well makes 

me feel good and (they’re) just a 
really good group of freshmen.”

As the freshmen traversed 

this process last semester, their 
progress had the coaching staff 
encouraged coming into the 
season.

“We’re at a point where (in) 

our preseason training, we’ve 
started to see that maturity 
take place,” Bakich said at 
media day, “where the younger 
guys are more physical, they’ve 
gotten stronger, they can slow 
the game down mentally. Now, 
you’re starting to see some of 
their performance show up a 
little bit and that’s where there 
is some encouragement and 
some freshman that will be in 
some roles that they’re gonna 
have some opportunities to 
compete in early and make early 
contributions.”

Despite 
their 
occasional 

tribulations, Bakich’s preseason 
prediction has come to fruition. 
The volatile nature of baseball 
prevents it from mimicking the 
one-and-done factory that is 
college basketball — freshmen 
are rarely key contributors in 
baseball.

The 
Wolverines, 
though, 

regularly pencil Blomgren and 
Franklin into their daily lineup. 
Donovan has found his way 
into over half of Michigan’s 
games, while Nelson has earned 
himself back-to-back starts. On 
the pitching side, Dragani and 
Criswell have repeatedly found 
themselves trusted with high 
leverage situations.

“They’ve 
been 
complementary 

pieces so far, would be the way 
I would describe it,” Bakich 
said. “They’re in a learning 
and growth stage still and 
they’re paying attention, they’re 
learning, they’re adjusting to 
the speed of this game and the 
level of competition here and 
some of them are playing more 
than others.”

Despite a 4-11 start, the 

Michigan 
coaching 
staff 

— 
especially 
recruiting 

coordinator Nick Schnabel — 
must be credited for putting 
together a class that has been 
ready to contribute since day 
one.

Recruiting to Ann Arbor is 

no easy task. The minimum 
temperature 
required 
for 

outdoor 
practices 
is 
zero 

degrees, 
a 
mark 
that 
has 

been flirted with more than 
a handful of times over the 
past few months. As a result, 
the Wolverines spend the first 
month of each season on the road 
— this year, migrating from San 
Diego to Palo Alto to Nashville 
over the opening month, and 
they reside thousands of miles 
from 
the 
sport’s 
recruiting 

hotbeds in Florida, Texas and 
southern California.

Instead, Schnabel and his 

staff 
must 
sell 
Michigan’s 

academics.

“The school is certainly one 

of the main reasons that we can 
attract (this) type of talent,” 
Bakich said “… For all those 
kids out there that are very 
good students that want to play 
at a very high level, this is an 
attractive option for them. So 
we’ve gotten in the conversation 
for players that are the best 
students and the best baseball 
players.”

Recruiting is a process that 

compounds, and recently, the 
Wolverines have been able to 
use the success of previous 
classes to reach new heights on 
the recruiting trail, culminating 
in their record-setting 2017 
class.

“A baseball program that — 

even though we’re in a hiccup 
right now — has been ascending,” 
Bakich said of his team. “And 
the trajectory has been up so 
people see the school, they see 
the athletic department, they 
see the facilities, they want to 
be a part of this.

“I think (these freshmen) 

will all make an impact by the 
time it’s said and done,” Bakich 
said. “There’s some guys that 
are very talented out there. 
So we’re certainly excited for 
those guys and their continued 
development.”

For Bakich and his staff, the 

job is to ensure that 2017 was not 
the pinnacle of the program’s 
trajectory. If that job lies in the 
hands of their freshman class, 
they have full confidence.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich has recruited a talented freshman class to Ann Arbor. 

Michigan’s leading man: Ako Thomas ready to take charge

Mount 
Carmel 
High 

School was in the midst of a 
doubleheader and in desperate 
need for some life.

Enter Ako Thomas.
The 
year 
was 
2012 
and 

Thomas was a freshman for 
the Caravan in Chicago, IL and 
was just beginning his fruitful 
baseball career.

After not starting on the elite 

varsity squad at the beginning of 
the year, Thomas was eventually 
called up within the first few 
weeks of the season due to his 
promising play at the plate.

The 
young, 
undersized 

freshman 
stepped 
up 
and 

delivered the performance of 
a lifetime, going 4-for-4. His 
inspiring performance gave his 
team the win — and would prove 
to be the birth of a superstar.

But his hot bat wasn’t the most 

impressive display of the day.

Stepping onto the infield, 

Thomas assumed his position 
at shortstop. A position that 
typically plays second fiddle 
to second base for Thomas, he 
fulfilled his duty well.

Then, on his very first play as 

a high school varsity baseball 
player, Thomas was forced to 
ground an absolute rocket hit 
by the opposing 
batter. The ball 
skipped once on 
the ground then 
thudded off his 
chest. 
Thomas 

collected himself 
and threw the 
forceout to first. 
He had laid his 
body 
on 
the 

line to make a 
play, and it left a 
memorable first impression.

“It just shows how much 

toughness and guts he has,” 

said Thomas’ high school coach 
Brian Hurry. “I mean the four 
hits were impressive, but all that 
was completely secondary to that 
play. I thought that play really 
showed what the kid is all about, 
internally. To me, it spoke to his 
competitiveness and his guts 
more than anything else.”

Added Thomas: “I do whatever 

it takes for the team, so if that 
means getting in front of a line 
drive then I’ll do it.”

His 
sophomore 
season, 

Thomas found himself in a 
position he would come to know 
all too well — leadoff hitter. Due 
in part to his leadership and 
performance in this spot and at 
second base, the Caravan won a 
state championship.

Thomas 
led 
another 

postseason 
surge 
his 
senior 

campaign, leading his team back 
to the state championship game. 
The Caravan would inevitably 
fall, but Thomas had made a 
lasting impression as an all-time 
great Mount Carmel baseball 
player. Needless to say, Thomas’ 
time spent at Mount Carmel 
helped shape him as an athlete, 
leader and person.

Despite 
having 
an 
older 

brother who played baseball for a 
different high school in Chicago, 
Thomas elected to explore an 
alternative route — an all-boys 

Catholic 
high 

school.

“I 
wanted 

something 
different in my 
life,” 
Thomas 

said. 
“I 
could 

see 
where 
my 

life 
was 
going 

and I wanted it 
to change. So I 
decided to go to 
Mount Carmel to 

get away from my neighborhood 
friends and just explore out, so 
that’s why I chose to go to Mount 

Carmel.”

His 
father, 
Zebedee, 
and 

mother, Reeshemah, have also 
helped Thomas every step of the 
way.

“My mom is always the most 

influential 
person 
for 
me,” 

Thomas said. “She’s just so 
hard-working, very independent 
woman and she just drives me 
and I just go out here and play for 
her and for my family.”

Added Michigan coach Erik 

Bakich: “He’s an inner city 
Chicago kid, he plays with 
a ton of energy, a good 
student from Carmel 
High 
School. 

Good parents — 
Reeshemah and 
Zebedee did a 
great job raising 
he and his three 
brothers.

“And 
he’s 

just a winner 
— that’s the 
word.”

Thomas 

finished 
off 
his 

time at 
Mount 

Carmel with a 

.397 
batting 

average, 
.991 

fielding percentage 
and 50 hits in his 
senior season. These 

impressive stats found 

him catching the eye of one 
program in particular.

Three years later, Thomas 

finds 
himself 
in 
a 
similar 

situation as he bats top of the 
order for the Wolverines.

Ever since his arrival in 

Ann 
Arbor, 
Thomas 
has 

shined bright both on and 

off the field. His coaches and 
teammates cannot speak highly 
enough about the quality of 
his play and his character. His 
typical charisma and positive 
personality consistently inspire 
everyone surrounding him.

“When I think of some of 

the 
greatest 
compliments 
a 

player could have, being a great 

competitor 

and 
being a great 
teammate 
are 
right 

there at the 

top,” 
Hurry 

said. 
“He 

certainly 
is 

both of them. 

Positive 
energy, 
he’s 
always 
smiling. 
He kinda 
lights 
up 

a 
room 

when he’s 
around, 
you just get 
in a better 
mood 
it 

seems. His 
attitude 

was 
very 
contagious 
to 

our program.”

Aside from bringing energy to 

the program, Thomas brought 
a quality of play that saw him 
starting from day one as a 
Wolverine.

His freshman year, Thomas 

accumulated 
a 
.258 
batting 

average 
off 
40 
hits 
and 

cemented himself as an integral 
part of the Michigan lineup. 
His proficiency from the plate 
is not — and has never been — 
the only noteworthy aspect of 
his game as he displayed great 
defensive prowess, an element 
the Wolverines take pride in.

“It’s always a thrill just to play 

for Michigan, period,” Thomas 

said. “And then to be the leadoff 
hitter is awesome as well, so 
I’m just gonna 
continue to do 
everything I can 
for the team.”

Thomas then 

broke out as one 
of the country’s 
premier 
second 

basemen 
in 

his 
sophomore 

campaign, 
leading the Big 
Ten 
in 
both 

batting average and on-base 
percentage. Amassing a .354 
batting average, he ascended the 
ranks of the batting order.

Now, 
Thomas 
is 
the 

definitive leadoff hitter and the 
Wolverines’ most prolific batter.

Thomas’ efforts this season, 

however, may come in vain as 
he seeks to lead his team out 
of a rebuilding season. It’s no 
surprise that a squad that lost 
15 athletes — 11 of those to the 
MLB draft — is suffering, with 
a 4-11 record. It’s incredibly 
difficult to guide a retool, rather 
than a rebuild, since many of the 
new players have yet to adapt to 
the pace of the college game.

Nevertheless, Thomas is up to 

the task, willing to do whatever 
his team needs to get it out of its 
slump.

“I 
definitely 

think 
and 

definitely 
the 

coaches and my 
teammates 
as 

well, 
think 
of 

me as a leader 
and 
a 
leading 

figure out there,” 
Thomas said. “I 
try my best to 
be the best vocal 
leader and just 
lead by my play as well.”

Added 
Bakich: 
“He’ll 
be 

one of the guys that will be 

instrumental 
in 
our 
turn-

around this season, and so we’re 

really 
looking 

forward to him 
taking the reigns 
and leading by 
example like he 
always does.”

Another area 

where 
Thomas 

leads is in his 
academics, 
earning 
Academic 
Big 

Ten 
Honors 

last year as a sophomore. A 
practice that began in his days at 
Mount Carmel, Thomas worked 
diligently in the classroom and 
on the field in hopes of acquiring 
the best degree he could.

“I think he just epitomizes 

what I want all our players 
to be,” Hurry said. “He was a 
true student athlete, he worked 
hard with his grades, he was 
relentless in his pursuit of 
being excellent and the greatest 
baseball player he could be.”

At Mount Carmel, Thomas’ 

great play was mirrored by his 
personality and his academics. 
He left a legacy of excellence 
and served as inspiration to his 
teammates.

At Michigan, Thomas is on 

a trajectory to do much of the 
same as Michigan’s leading man. 

Of course, this is 
nothing new for 
him. 
So 
when 

asked about his 
legacy 
for 
the 

Wolverines, his 
answer 
makes 

sense.

“We’ll 
see, 

I’m 
not 
sure,” 

Thomas 
said. 

“I’ll try to leave 
a good one, that’s 

for sure. I just do whatever I 
can for the team. Play hard, run 
hard, just the usual.”

Big Ten preview: Nebraska, Iowa and Indiana set to challenge for title

Snow and baseball are not two 

things that people commonly 
associate with one another, but 
that’s typical in the world of 
Big Ten baseball. It is difficult 
for the conference to reach a 
level of national success when 
many of its schools still have 
weather below freezing in mid-
March. Despite this, the Big Ten 
is coming off a season in which 
five conference teams made the 
NCAA Tournament — tied for 
a conference record — and an 
impressive 35 combined players 
were drafted. The Big Ten has 
developed into one of the better 
leagues in the nation, and looks 
poised to continue its recent 
success in the upcoming season.

Michigan (4-11) has kept up 

with the rest of the conference in 
recent years and has positioned 
itself near the top, though early 
returns hint that this year may 
be different. This season, like 
last, the Wolverines should see 
a plethora of tough conference 
competition, 
highlighted 
by 

defending 
Big 
Ten 
regular 

season 
champion 
Nebraska, 

defending Big Ten Tournament-
champion 
Iowa 
and 
NCAA 

Tournament-participant 
Indiana.

Nebraska: Last season: (16-

7-1, 35-22-1) This Season: (0-0, 
10-7)

Following 
their 
Big 
Ten 

regular season championship 
— and a season that would 
ultimately end with a defeat in 
the first round of the tournament 
— 2017 Big Ten Coach of the 
Year Darin Erstad and Nebraska 
look to bounce back from a 
disappointing end to the season. 
Following last year’s campaign, 
the Cornhuskers return all but 
seven players, including All-Big 
Ten First Team senior outfielder 
Scott Schreiber and All-Big Ten 
Third Team shortstop Angelo 
Altavilla. Erstad will rely on 
Schreiber 
and 
Altavilla 
to 

carry the offensive load come 
conference play. Schreiber, after 
hitting .330/.376/.494 last year, 
has followed up with another 
stellar season thus far, hitting 

.348/.436/.606. 
Altavilla, 
on 

the other hand, who posted 
a .316/.401/.406 stat line last 
year, has struggled at the plate, 
hitting 
only 
.246/.421/.298. 

The rest of the team has also 
struggled to hit the ball, as the 
team’s average is just .258 thus 
far, compared to last year’s team 
average of .281.

On the mound 

last 
season, 

Nebraska 
had 

the 
Big 
Ten’s 

second-lowest 
team 
earned-

run 
averaged 

at 
3.73, 
but 

lost its top two 
starting pitchers 
to 
the 
draft. 

This season, the 
Cornhuskers have registered a 
significantly worse team ERA 
of 4.92, good for fifth highest 
in the conference. Redshirt 
junior 
Jake 
McSteen, 
who 

recorded a 2.04 ERA in 39.2 
innings of relief for Nebraska 

last season, has struggled with 
his transition to starter, posting 
a 6.00 ERA thus far. Senior Luis 
Alvarado, on the other hand, has 
excelled as the Cornhuskers’ top 
starting pitcher with a 2.70 ERA 
in 23.1 innings. If last year is any 
indication, this Nebraska team 
could become very dangerous 

if they can find 
their 
groove 

come 
Big 
Ten 

play. But for now, 
they are playing 
at 
just 
above 

.500 and have 
had their share 
of struggles. 

Iowa: 
Last 

season: 
(15-

9, 39-22) This 
Season: 
(0-0, 

8-6)

After a good but not great 

regular season, Iowa entered 
the Big Ten Tournament as the 
No. 5 seed. Led by the Big Ten 
Player of the Year, All-American 
first baseman Jake Adams, the 

Hawkeyes scraped their way to 
an unlikely Big Ten Tournament 
championship and an NCAA 
Tournament berth. Adams and 
his impressive .335/.417/.747 stat 
line, 29 homers and 71 RBIs, 
as well as All-Big Ten Second 
Team shortstop Mason McCoy 
are gone, and Iowa has had to 
look for offensive production 
and 
leadership 
elsewhere. 

Junior 
outfielder 
Robert 

Neustrom (.321/.403/.415) and 
senior catcher Tyler Cropley 
(.300/.417/.420), 
both 
All-Big 

Ten Second Team selections 
last year, have stepped up to 
the challenge. Iowa, however, 
has not seen the same offensive 
success 
it 
saw 
last 
season 

overall. The team is hitting just 
.248 this season, as opposed to 
.284 last year. Iowa has salvaged 
a meager 8-6 record so far. It 
has remained above .500 due in 
large part to a weak schedule, 
playing only five games against 
over .500 teams, winning none 
of those contests.

The 
Hawkeyes’ 
pitching 

has been a different story 
from their hitting, taking full 
advantage of the weak offensive 
competition. Despite losing All-
Big Ten Second Team pitcher 
Nick Gallagher to the draft, 
redshirt junior Nick Allgeyer 
— who has 24 strikeouts and 
a 1.82 ERA in 
four 
starts 
— 

and the rest of 
the roation have 
combined 
for 

the 
fifth-best 

team ERA in the 
Big Ten (4.20). 
While Iowa has 
players 
who 

can 
continue 

to produce all 
season, 
the 

team’s lack of success against 
above-average competition and 
offensive struggles signal red 
flags for the team heading into 
conference play. Repeating the 
success they saw last year seems 
unlikely, but still possible, at 

this point.

Indiana: Last season: (14-

9-1, 34-24-2) This Season: 
(0-0, 12-4)

After placing a disappointing 

sixth in Big Ten play last season 
despite being showered with 
praise, Indiana, the only Big 
Ten team currently ranked, has 
made the NCAA Tournament 
in four of the past five years 
and is poised to further its 
recent 
success 
this 
season. 

Despite losing their top hitter 
from last season, Tony Butler 
(.314/.418/.454), the Hoosiers 
have started the season strong, 
holding the conference’s best 
record. 
Senior 
All-Big 
Ten 

Second Team outfielder Logan 
Sowers (.333/.413/.537) decided 
to return to school for his final 
season and has stepped into 
the role as team leader, helping 
Indiana obtain the fifth-best 
team batting average in the 
Big Ten at .275 thus far. Unlike 
other most other teams in the 
Big Ten, Indiana’s offensive 
focus is more on the big hit as 
opposed to stringing together 
multiple singles; it is second in 
the conference in both home 
runs (15) and doubles (38).

While the offense has been 

good for the Hoosiers, their 
true 
calling 
card 
is 
their 

pitching. With a miniscule 2.92 
team ERA, Indiana’s pitching 
leads the Big Ten in ERA by 
nearly 0.3 points. All-Big Ten 
Third Team pitcher Pauly Milto 
has a 2.36 ERA in four starts to 

go along with a 
batting average 
against of only 
.216.

Team 
pitcher 

Cal Krueger has 
been 
dominant 

in his sophomore

not 

allowing a single 
run thus far in 
11 
innings 
of 

relief. Indiana’s hot start does 
not appear to be cooling off 
anytime soon, and the Hoosiers 
should be successful in Big Ten 
play this year. They are serious 
contenders, if not favorites, to 
win the Big Ten title.

Position-by-position breakdown: Wolverines not as deep as last season

At the end of last season, 

Michigan lost 11 players to 
the 
MLB 
Draft 
— 
pitcher 

Oliver Jaskie, infielder Drew 
Lugbauer, 
catcher 
Harrison 

Wenson and infielder Michael 
Brdar. Jaskie was the team’s 
ace and was drafted in the sixth 
round. Lugbauer led the team 
in slugging percentage, home 
runs and runs batted in. With 
such significant roster turnover 
heading into this season, some 
minor growing pains were to 
be expected. Whether a current 
4-11 
record 
can 
be 
called 

“minor,” though, really depends 
on how well Michigan fares in 
conference play going forward.

A recruiting class ranked 

tenth nationally was supposed 
to plug the remaining holes 
in the roster. But the youthful 
Wolverines have struggled so far 
to do so.

At 
times, 
Michigan 
has 

shown 
that 
it 
is 
capable 

offensively. Through 15 games, 
the Wolverines have recorded 
107 hits and taken 65 walks. On 
the flip side, a .221 team batting 
average and 4.13 runs per game 
average have let them down.

The pitching staff has also 

proved to be inconsistent thus 
far, posting a cumulative earned-
run average of 4.66. Defensively, 
Michigan has recorded 27 errors 
with 
a 
fielding 
percentage 

hovering around .950.

As 
the 
Wolverines 
begin 

a five-game homestand with 
a three-game series against 
Bowling 
Green 
beginning 

Friday, The Daily breaks down 
the team position-by-position:

Pitchers
Though Michigan lost Jaskie, 

senior Mac Lozer and others to 
the draft, the team does return 
many from last year’s pitching 
staff. Seniors Alec Rennard and 
Jayce Vancena have starting 
experience from last year, but 
have stepped into the spotlight 
as two of the main starters. 

Rennard has pitched 16 innings 
thus far with an ERA of 3.38 and 
13 strikeouts. Vancena is still 
regarded as one of Wolverines’ 
top pitchers, despite an 0-3 
record, and a 9.35 ERA through 
8.2 innings.

Sophomore Karl Kauffman, 

who pitched a total of 13 innings 
last year, has really come on 
in his second season. With 
Vancena’s struggles early on, 
Kauffman has staked his claim 
to become the No. 2 behind 
Rennard. Kauffman has posted a 
2-2 record with a 4.64 ERA. He 
had stellar outings against Army 
and Stanford, letting up only a 
single run between the two.

Another sophomore fighting 

for a starting position, left-
hander Tommy Henry, has put 
up impressive numbers as well. 
Against Stanford, Henry went 
seven scoreless innings and has 
a 2.74 ERA in 23 innings.

In the bullpen, junior William 

Tribucher and freshman Ben 
Dragani have been the go-to 
guys. Tribucher has an ERA of 
2.53, while Dragani has allowed 
just six hits and four runs in 

13 innings of work. Junior 
Troy Miller and freshman Jeff 
Criswell are also set to see a lot 
of time in relief going forward.

Catcher
The 
position 
battle 
that 

received 
the 
most 
attention 

this offseason was behind the 
plate. Senior Brock Keener may 
have seemed destined to fill the 
void left by Wenson, but three 
younger guys have also been in 
the mix for the job. Sophomore 
Harrison 
Salter, 
redshirt 

freshman Marcus Chavez and 
freshman Joe Donovan have all 
seen time at the position this 
season. Keener has been the 
most 
productive 
offensively 

of the four, recording a .280 
batting average, while Chavez 
and Salter have performed well 
defensively. Altogether, expect 
it to be somewhat of a revolving 
door behind the plate, with all 
four seeing playing time going 
forward, especially if the team 
continues to struggle.

First Base
In 
the 
sixth 
inning 
of 

Michigan’s first game of the 
season, 
fifth-year 
senior 

Hector Gutierrez powered a 
grand slam to right field to 
give the Wolverines a nine-run 
advantage against Army. “Guti” 
as he’s been christened by his 
teammates, is one of the team’s 
best hitters and as a result has 
alternated between first and 
third base in order to get at-bats.

Keener and talented freshman 

slugger Jesse Franklin have also 
seen time at first. All three can 
be offensive weapons on their 
day, so expect to see a lot of 
rotation here throughout the 
season.

Second Base
When the bottom of the 

first inning rolls around at any 
Michigan home game this year, 
the first song is T.I.’s “Bring 
Em’ Out” — junior Ako Thomas’ 
walkout music. One of the best 
all-around players on the team, 
Thomas burst onto the scene 
last year as an All-Big Ten First 
Team selection. Symbolic of the 
Wolverines’ struggles so far, 
Thomas, who helped solidify 
one of the best defensive teams 
in the nation last year, leads the 
team with seven errors.

His .224 batting average this 

season also hasn’t been on par 
with the offensive numbers he 
put up a year ago. And yet, if the 
Wolverines are going to turn the 
tide, Thomas will most likely be 
the one to lead them.

Shortstop
The departure of the sure-

handed Michael Brdar left a gap 
at the shortstop position coming 
into 
the 
season. 
Freshman 

Jack 
Blomgren 
has 
stepped 

up to fill that void. Blomgren, 
another member of this record-
breaking recruiting class for 
the Wolverines has struggled at 
times this season. Blomgren has 
recorded six errors and a .154 
batting average. Despite this, the 
coaching staff appears content 
on having the freshman press on.

Third Base
As has been a theme at other 

positions this year, no one has 
excelled at third base. Junior 
Jimmy Kerr is widely considered 
the starter at the position, 
but only has a .880 fielding 
percentage and a .125 batting 
average. Kerr is a respected 
veteran on the team though, and 

despite his struggles, he will 
remain a fixture in the starting 
lineup.

Outfield
As a redshirt sophomore, 

Miles Lewis started every game 
in left field for the Wolverines. 
Now a year later, Lewis should 
do the same barring injury. 
The current clubhouse leader 
in RBIs and home runs with 
12 and two respectively, Lewis 
typically hits in the two-hole. In 
addition to hitting for power, the 
hulking 6-foot-1, 200-pounder 
is quite capable of getting on 
base and getting into scoring 
opportunities, having recorded 
29 walks and 19 stolen bases last 
year. A 1.000 fielding percentage 
this season also speaks to what a 
great all-around player Lewis is.

To the right of Lewis is 

another 
powerful 
junior, 

Jonathan Engelmann. Typically 
Michigan’s 
cleanup 
hitter, 

Engelmann currently is hitting 
at a rate of .237 with a team-high 
14 hits. Like Lewis, the young 
Wolverines look to Engelmann 
for not only an offensive spark 
but also as a source of leadership.

Sophomore 
right-fielder 

Christian Bullock rounds out the 
outfield and leads the team with 
four stolen bases. The speedster 
has been capable of getting on 
base as well, hitting .250 and 
reaching base on four walks.

The 
outfield 
as 
a 
whole 

has 
been 
fairly 
consistent 

defensively, with Bullock owning 
the only error, which occurred at 
the top of the 7th inning against 
Lawrence Tech on Wednesday.

DH
Sophomore Dominic Clementi 

has been a major contributor 
this season as a designated 
hitter, though he could also play 
in the outfield. As a freshman 
he finished last season with a 
.409 batting average through 18 
games. Thus far, Clementi has 
been hitting at a significantly 
lesser rate of .242. As the season 
goes on though, Clementi could 
be a valuable offensive weapon 
for Michigan.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Senior pitcher Alec Rennard has been a consistent starter for the Wolverines thus far, pitching 16 innings with an earned-run average of 3.38.

Nebraska 

could be very 
dangerous if it 
finds its groove.
