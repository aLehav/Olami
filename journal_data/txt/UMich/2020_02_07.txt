As part of University of 
Michigan 
Housing’s 
new 
commitment 
to 
redesign 
and update all 18 of the 
multicultural 
lounges 
on 
campus, Abeng Lounge in 
East Quad Residence Hall, 
Audre Lorde Lounge in Helen 
Newberry 
Residence 
Hall 
and Yuri Kochiyama Lounge 
in South Quad Residence Hall 
are set to be renovated this 
summer. The project, which 
launched in 2015 based on 
student feedback, is set to be 
completed in 2021, in time 
for the 50th anniversary of 
the 
Multicultural 
Lounge 
program. 
According 
to 
Amanda 
McLittle, 
director 
of 
diversity and inclusion, the 
renovation 
plan 
includes 
a 
redesign 
of 
the 
walls, 
furniture 
and 
technology 
of each space as well as 
structural 
improvements. 
These changes come at no 
additional cost to students or 
University Housing.
“One thing we’ve learned,

Angela Washko, an artist, 
writer and activist, began 
her lecture speaking about 
her project targeting hate

in 
public

Michigan Theater. 
“I thought that I could 
use 
my 
background 
in 
performance art, grassroots 
activism 
and 
collective 
organizing to directly talk 
to players about why the 
community had become so 
homophobic, 
misogynistic, 
and 
racist 
in 
its 
public 
communication channels, at 
least on all the servers that 
I’ve played on,” Washko said.
As part of the Penny Stamps 
Speaker Series, Washko spoke 
to Art & Design students 
and 
community 
members 
Thursday evening about her 
various art pieces targeting 
misogyny 
and 
promoting 
inclusivity in niche online 
spaces.

ALICE LIU/Daily
Columbia University professor Jennifer Hirsch speaks about campus sexual assault at a talk and panel about her and Shamus Kahn’s new 
book, “Sexual Citizens,” at Rackham Amphitheater Thursday afternoon..

MEGHANA LODHAVIA
For The Daily

A woman who reports 
she was held in captivity 
and abused at two southeast 
Michigan 
hotels 
filed 
a 
lawsuit 
that 
contends 
Marriott International, Inc. 
and 
the 
InterContinental 
Hotels Group are liable for 
failing to notice she was being 
trafficked at their properties.
The lawsuit, filed in the 
U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Michigan 
in December, provides details 
of how the victim, identified 
as H.G. due to the sensitive 
nature of the case, withstood 
repeated abuse at the hotels 
over the span of several years.
The case is one of 26 
similar lawsuits filed across 
the country against 15 major 
hotel brands. Attorneys filed 
a movement to consolidate 
the cases under a single 
federal judge, but it was 
denied Feb. 5 by the Judicial 
Panel 
on 
Multidistrict 
Litigation.
Court filings claim H.G. 
was first trafficked in 2003 
when she was a 17-year-old 

living in Detroit, not under 
the custody of her parents. 
The lawsuit states H.G.’s 
traffickers would frequently 
kidnap her and hold her 
captive for days at a time at 
the Ann Arbor Fairfield Inn 
or the downtown Detroit 
Holiday Inn Express and 
Suites. 
These 
hotels 
are 
franchises operated under 
the Marriott and IHG brands, 
respectively.

“H.G’s 
trafficker 

specifically 
chose 
the 
hotels in Detroit and Ann 
Arbor because they had a 
reputation for commercial 
sex and illegal activity,” the 
complaint states.
While at the hotels, H.G. 
was 
allegedly 
verbally, 
physically 
and 
sexually 
abused by the traffickers 
and buyers. If she did not 
sexually 
service 
enough 
buyers to meet daily quotas, a 
trafficker would beat her, the 
complaint says. 
The 
lawsuit 
details 
instances at the Detroit 
hotel in which hotel staff 
did not attend to H.G.’s 
screams and in which

Students, 
faculty 
and 
community members filled 
Rackam 
Amphitheaterto 
hear 
Jennifer 
Hirsch, 
professor of sociomedical 
sciences 
at 
Columbia 
University 
and 
Shamus 
Khan, chair of sociology 
at Columbia speak about 
the prominence of sexual 
assault on college campuses. 
Education 
graduate 
student 
Kamaria 
Porter 
spoke 
alongside 
epidemiologist 
and 
2018 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Abdul El-Sayed on a panel 
addressing campus sexual 
assault.

Hirsch 
and 
Khan 
discussed 
their 
research 
regarding 
sexual 
assault 
and their book, “Sexual 
Citizens: A Landmark Study 
of Sex, Power, and Assault 
on Campus,” which was 
published in January. 
Allison Alexy, assistant 
professor 
of 
women’s 
studies 
and 
modern 
Japanese culture at the 
University, described her 
experience working with 
survivors of sexual assault.
“Sexual 
assault 
is 
something that looms large 
in our society,” Alexy said. 
“Students regularly share 
their 
experiences 
with 
me. 
Sometimes 
because 
they are looking for formal 

or 
informal 
support, 
sometimes 
because 
they 
need my help specifically, 
sometimes 
because 
they 
are reflecting on how their 
experiences 
with 
sexual 
assault 
— 
or 
university 
responses to it — have 
shaped their lives and their 
world views.”
Before 
discussing 
her 
research in sexual assault, 
Hirsch spoke directly to 
her audience and reassured 
them that they have her 
support.
“To the survivors in the 
room,” she said. “We see 
you.”
Hirsch 
continued 
by 
sharing a story of a freshman 
girl at Columbia who was 

sexually assaulted at the 
beginning of her college 
career. Hirsch said that, as 
most survivors do, the girl 
partially blamed herself for 
the events that took place. 
She added young people 
should know that it is their 
right to set boundaries, a 
message 
that 
resounded 
with the audience.
Hirsch 
also 
said, 
though this example she 
used 
exemplified 
toxic 
masculinity, there are many 
other types of assault that 
can take place.
“Sexual Citizens outlines 
how to prevent campus 
sexual assault,” Hirsch said. 

‘You will see you don’t belong’

Cozine Welch holds multiple posi-
tions at the University of Michi-
gan, including managing editor of 
The Michigan Review of Prisoner 
Creative Writing, co-instructor of 
the Prison Creative Arts Project, 
researcher for the Carceral State 
Project and producer of the “While 
We Were Away” podcast, among 
others. Welch is not a student at the 
University but hopes to enroll in an 
MBA program in the fall. 
In addition to occupying these 
roles, Welch was formerly incar-
cerated for 20 years in the state 
of Michigan and since then has 
worked to publicize and fight the 
injustices within the carceral sys-
tem in this country. 
Welch spends most of his day 
on the University campus, but is 
unable to find housing nearby due 
to the high cost of living in Ann 
Arbor, as well as the discrimination 
that those with a felony record face 
in renting a home.
Welch said that after almost three 
years of working in Ann Arbor he 
is still living at friends’ homes. He 
said the process of divulging prior 
incarceration records to 
landlords, through 
checking 
a 
crimi-

nal history box, feels personally 
demoralizing.
“I still can’t find housing,” Welch 
said. “I’m really still staying here 
off the kindness of a friend. I’m 
trying to find housing, and maybe 
now I will since I’m doing this cam-
paign (fighting against ‘the box’ on 
housing and employment applica-
tions) but that’s the reality of Ann 
Arbor. (The issue) is the price point 
and the fact that you have a felony.”
This also occurs with applica-
tions to the University of Michi-
gan’s undergraduate and graduate 
programs: students must disclose 
if they were formerly convicted of 
a felony.
The University 
does not 
admit 
stu-
dents on 
parole, 
which 
often lasts 
three years, 
and requires 
appli-

cants to check a box if they have a 
felony. This topic is currently being 
reviewed in many states as part of a 
larger debate over voting rights.
Welch said he feels unwanted on 
the University of Michigan-Ann 
Arbor campus. 

“If you come to Ann Arbor, you’re 
Black before you even get to wheth-
er or not you actually have a felony, 
right?” Welch said. “And if you 
walk down the street in Ann Arbor, 
you will see you don’t belong, 
because you don’t see anybody 
that looks like you. The 
only 
time you 
see 

somebody else that looks like you 
is in the reflection or a storefront. 
It’s based largely on the University 
because they’re like, ‘Well, that’s 
what Flint and Dearborn campuses 
are for.’”
Welch pointed out the disparities 
between the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses in comparison to the 
Ann Arbor campus, specifically 
noting the diversity of Flint and 
Dearborn classes.
“(Those campuses are) under-
served, 
under-staffed, 
under-
everything 
satellite 
campus,” 
Welch said. “I’ve guest lectured 
at Dearborn a couple of times and 
when you go to Dearborn, you’re 
like, ‘Oh, this is what collegiate 
life should look like; my class looks 
really diverse.’”
School of Social Work alum Yusef 
Shakur is an activist, author and 
formerly 
incarcerated 
person. 
He said he hopes the future may 
be different for other formerly 
incarcerated people look-
ing to become involved in 
academia in Ann Arbor. 
Shakur said after talking 
with Lynn Videka, Social 
Work School dean, in the 
spring of 2019, the School 
of Social Work will no 
longer place a box asking 
about previous felony con-
victions of applications . 
The move follows pres-
sure from the undergrad-
uate campus organization 
“UMich Behind Bars.”

“We benefited from an 
undergrad organization,” 
Shakur said. “Once it hap-
pened with the under-

The 
American 
Freedom 
Law Center, a conservative 
public 
interest 
law 
firm 
based in Ann Arbor, won a 
round in court on Jan. 15 
when motions to dismiss the 
group’s lawsuit were denied. 
The group is suing Michigan 
Attorney General Dana Nessel 
and Agustin Arbulu, former 
director 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Department of Civil Rights, on 
the grounds of a constitutional 
rights violation.
The 
lawsuit 
began 
last 
February when Nessel and 
Arbulu issued a press release 
in response to the Southern 
Poverty Law Center’s annual 
Hate Group Map identifying 
active hate groups across the 
country; the report listed 
31 hate groups in Michigan, 
a 
6.5-percent 
increase 
as 
compared to the previous 
year. The report identifies the 
Ann Arbor-based AFLC as an 
anti-Muslim hate group. In 
response, Nessel and Abulu 
announced the establishment 
of a hate crimes unit in the 
attorney general’s office as 
well as a database to document 
incidents of hate and bias.
On 
March 
8, 
Nessel 
released 
an 
additional 
press 
release 
officially 
establishing the new hate 
crimes unit and reaffirming 
her commitment to protecting 
all organizations’ rights to 
freedom of speech. Nessel also 
said it was her responsibility 
to take action against possible 
hate crimes stemming from 
offensive or bigoted language. 

“When a criminal offense is 
committed against a person or 
property and it is motivated 
by an offender’s bias against 

a particular group, then my 
office will act,” Nessel said. 

The 
complaint 
contends 
that the AFLC is being unfairly 
targeted 
by 
this 
policy 
directive based on political 
views and has suffered injury 
to its reputation. The group 
claims the policy directive put 
forth by Nessel and Arbulu 
infringes on their right to free 
speech, protected by the First 
Amendment, and their rights 
to expressive association and 
equal protection of the law, 
both protected by the 14th 
Amendment.
Nessel and Arbulu filed 
separate motions to dismiss, 
however, 
District 
Judge 
Paul Maloney denied these 
motions, meaning the lawsuit 
will move on to the discovery 
phase. 
“Defendants’ 
general 
disagreement 
with 
the 
scope and nature of their 
new 
initiative 
does 
not 
undermine the effect that 
the announcement of the new 
policy on AFLC’s reputation 
and activities, as established 
by the affidavit submitted by 
AFLC,” Maloney wrote in the 
opinion. “And, assuming the 
allegations in the complaint 
to be true, AFLC has pled 
sufficient 
facts 
to 
state 
claims under the First and 
Fourteenth Amendments.”
The SPLC is an Alabama-
based, 
nonprofit 
legal 
advocacy 
organization 
focusing on civil rights. The 
group’s oft-cited Intelligence 
Report identify and track 
hate groups across the nation, 
however, the group has faced 
recent criticism questioning 
the SPLC’s definitions of hate 
and extremism and defending 
some 
of 
the 
groups 
and 
individuals targeted by hate 
group reports. 

The 
SPLC 
declined 
to 
comment at the time of this 
story, however, the group 
has 
published 
multiple 
articles regarding the AFLC’s 
anti-Muslim 
stance. 
The 
Intelligence Report defines 
“anti-Muslim” hate groups as 
those which “exhibit extreme 
hostility 
toward 
Muslims 
… and attribute to (Islam’s) 
followers an inherent set of 
negative traits.” In a profile on 
David Yerushalmi, co-founder 
and senior counsel of the 
AFLC, 
the 
SPLC 
outlines 
Yerushalmi’s history of anti-
Muslim activism.
 In an article titled “Is 
the 
War 
Against 
Terror 
Rational?”, 
Yerushalmi 
condemns Islam.
“We must be prepared to 
fight a full-scale war against 
all nations and people who 
advocate, accommodate, or 
acquiesce to the Islamic world 
view,” 
Yerushalmi 
wrote. 
“We will never defeat ‘radical 
Islam’ 
without 
defeating 
Islam itself because they are 
one and the same.”
The SPLC cites the AFLC’s 
amicus 
curiae 
brief 
from 
February 
2018 
supporting 
President Trump’s “extreme 
vetting” 
travel 
policy 
as 
further 
evidence 
of 
anti-
Muslim hate. The analysis 
of the brief draws attention 
to misinformation put forth 
about Sharia, Islamic law.
“Its religiously-laden terms 
such as ‘Islamic radicalism’ 
and 
‘sharia 
supremacism’ 
does little to mask the brief’s 
anti-Muslim 
agenda,” 
the 
SPLC writes. “It also makes 
the 
fundamental 
mistake 
of 
equating 
sharia 
with 
ideological extremism, when 
in fact it is merely a set of 
guiding principles to living 
a moral life set out in the 
Qur’an and is akin to how 

halacha is practiced among 
many 
religiously-observant 
Jews.”
The 
SPLC 
further 
denounces 
the 
AFLC’s 
American Laws for American 
Courts initiative, a legislative 
model for bills prohibiting 
foreign 
laws 
in 
American 
courts, focused specifically on 
Sharia “law.” The SPLC points 
out that Sharia is not actually 
law and that such a protection 
is 
already 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution. 
They 
sayconclude that the ALAC 
initiative 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
promote 
unfounded 
fear, 
linking 
anti-Muslim 
legislative 
rhetoric 
to 
increasing hate crimes against 
American Muslims. 
“Driven by hate groups, the 
ALAC initiative has created 
unfounded 
fear, 
and 
has 
sought to demonize Islam and 
American Muslims across the 
nation through legislation and 
rhetoric,” the SPLC writes. 

Robert 
Muise, 
AFLC 
co-founder 
and 
senior 
counsel, said he felt confident 
about 
the 
case’s 
outcome 
following this victory.
“In light of the judge’s 
ruling on that motion to 
dismiss, I’m quite confident 
that we’re going to ultimately 
prevail,” Muise said. “And our 
ultimate goal is to protect the 
rights to freedom of speech 
and 
right 
to 
expressive 
association, and to prevent 
government 
officials 
from 
weaponizing their offices for 
political purposes.”
Law School student Kevin 
Deutsch 
said 
he 
wasn’t 
surprised 
the 
motions 
to 
dismiss were denied.

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look at 
one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA senior Julia Fanzeres on 
her story “Solomon Rajput is riding the socialist wave”:

“I chose to do this story because when Solomon first announced his 
candidacy it was very fascinating because he’s a med student taking 
a leave of absence to take on an 85-year old political dynasty here in 
Ann Arbor, the Dingell family, and I just really wanted to know more 
about the person and what were his motivations behind his campaign 
and the pillars of his platform. So it started off Solomon and I had 
already spoken for a couple pieces. So we got in contact with this 
campaign and we decided a day for me to follow him around while 
he was canvassing with his ‘army’, as he likes to call it of grassroots 
volunteers. And then I, along with a photographer, Alec Cohen, went 
along to canvass with him and just to really see how that was like with 
a fellow of his Alec. So that was really fascinating to be able to see 
the canvassing and the inspiration that he had throughout the entire 
campaign. It was also great to hear from Congresswoman Dingell I 
was able to get her perspective on Solomon Rajput campaign and how 
she differs a little bit.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
It’s difficult for any campaign to make the convincing 
argument for your candidate and have them show up and cast a 
ballot, but it’s increasingly difficult when it’s a caucus, when it’s a 
specific night at a specific time,” Ouellette said. “And not only that, 
you don’t get to go behind the curtain and cast a ballot. You are 
visibly out there for a candidate. You have to stand in line, stand in 
one place, and your body represents your vote.”

H.G. 
approached 
the 
front desk staff bleeding, 
received no help and was 
taken back upstairs by her 
trafficker. 
Further, 
the 
plaintiff argues that, in 
addition to the “constant 
stream of male visitors to 
her room,” there were clear 
indications 
crimes 
had 
occurred.
According 
to 
Tiffany 
Ellis, an associate attorney 
for Weitz & Luxenberg 
representing H.G., hotels 
profit from traffickers and 
are therefore not motivated 
to ensure employees are 
reporting trafficking.
“All of these (signs) add 
up over time in a hotel 
… If the cleaning staff 
sees some of these things 
and the front desk staff 
doesn’t, they should know 
who to tell about it,” Ellis 
said. “There should be a 
common point of contact 

and a common reporting 
period. There should also 
be 
auditing 
procedures 
that go into place to ensure 
that 
these 
policies 
are 
being followed. I think 
that at the root of it, this 
is about greed and turning 
a blind eye to things that 
they should have stopped.”

School 
student 
Ashleigh Pelto, fellow at 
the 
Human 
Trafficking 
Institute, told The Daily 
she believes this lawsuit 
will pressure the hotel 
industry to begin making 
more 
drastic 
policy 
changes.
“I 
think 
that 
the 
discovery 
that 
(hotel 
brands) 
could 
be 
held 
responsible for trafficking 
that’s going on in their 
own 
hotels 
is 
probably 
the biggest thing towards 
prevention,” 
Pelto 
said. 
“Because, 
if 
it’s 
going 
to be something where 
they could lose money or 
even be held criminally 
responsible, I think that’s 
going to be the biggest 

incentive and push for them 
to start figuring out how to 
stop it from happening.”
Pelto said it is easy to 
forget trafficking is local 
and that training should 
not 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
hospitality industry.
“I think a lot of times 
there’s a perception that 
trafficking is something 
that 
happens 
overseas 
or only in major cities or 
at major sporting events 
like the Super Bowl … 
but it’s something that’s 
happening 
every 
day, 
and it’s going on in Ann 
Arbor,” Pelto said. “And 
so … learning to recognize 
those signs is something 
that anyone can learn how 
to do.”
Portfolio 
Hotels 
and 
Resorts, the operator of 
the Ann Arbor Fairfield 
Inn 
franchise, 
provided 
The Daily with a statement 
condemning 
human 
trafficking and establishing 
that the company took over 
management of the hotel 
in 2013 after the alleged 

events occurred.
“We 
take 
human 
trafficking 
with 
the 
utmost seriousness and are 
committed to the training 
and engagement of our hotel 
teams … All Fairfield Inn 
Ann Arbor employees have 
successfully completed the 
required Marriott training 
on 
preventing 
human 
trafficking,” the statement 
reads.
In an email to The Daily, 
IHG spokesperson Jacob 
Hawkins wrote that he is 
not able to comment on 
pending 
litigation, 
but 
that IHG is committed 
to 
combatting 
human 
trafficking 
in 
their 
properties.
“We 
condemn 
human 
trafficking in all forms and 
are committed to working 
with hotel owners to fight 
human trafficking across 
our industry and in local 
communities,” 
Hawkins 
wrote. “As part of this, we

but decades down the line, 
it’s wise to save and plan 
ahead, which is what we 
now do,” McLittle said. “It’s 
part and parcel of caring for 
these spaces.” 
One of the lounges set to 
be renovated this summer 
is Abeng Lounge, located 
in East Quad. It is named 
after 
the 
abeng 
musical 
instrument 
of 
the 
Akan 
people of Ghana, and it was 
created 
in 
1971, 
making 
it the first multicultural 
lounge on campus. Besides 
the redesign, the lounge will 
move from the basement to 
the first floor, where it will 
be taking the place of the 
Madrigal Lounge. 
As current co-chairs of 
East Quad’s multicultural 
council, 
LSA 
freshmen 
Gabriella Dias and Janna 
Girotto are in Abeng Lounge 
often, 
both 
for 
council 
meetings and socializing. 
They said they hope the 
lounge’s 
relocation 
will 
bring more attention to the 
space. However, with the 
increased foot traffic, they 
said they had some worries 
the meaning of the space 
would be lost. 
“It’s not just a lounge 
area, 
it’s 
an 
area 
that 
is 
commemorating 
important 
history,” 
Dias 
said. “It’s meant to be the 
multicultural area, not just 
a place where there are 
couches.” 
In an effort to maintain 
the 
space’s 
historical 
significance, 
Girotto 

suggested that they place 
a plaque in the lounge’s 
original spot in the basement 
after 
they 
complete 
the 
renovation, similar to the 
current plaque in the lounge 
that 
defines 
abeng 
and 
talks about the heritage 
represented in the space.
“It will be nice to move 
us into a more modernized 
space but still keeping that 
history, and also moving 
us 
somewhere 
more 
accessible,” Girotto said. “I 
am definitely on board with 
that.”
LSA junior Mya Gibson is 
the Diversity Peer Educator 
for South Quad, where the 
Yuri Kochiyama Lounge is 
housed on the first floor. 
Due to its proximity to the 
front doors of South Quad 
and the dining hall, it is more 
used than the Abeng Lounge 
is in East Quad. Gibson said 
she believes the renovations 
will be more focused on 
aesthetic 
changes 
rather 
than functionality.
“(Yuri 
Kochiyama) 
is 
an 
incredible 
woman,” 
Gibson said. “She’s done 
a lot of work for Asian 
Americans, so there’s a lot 
of information that you can 
read on that. I hope they’re 
able to push that more 
because currently, it’s kind 
of put in the background. 
You don’t really notice it 
unless you’re looking for 
it, whereas other lounges 
such as the Afro American 
(Lounge) in the basement 
of South Quad, they have a 
lot of paintings and murals 
to celebrate and to discuss 
Afro American history, so I 

think that would be cool to 
see.”
In previous years, some of 
the multicultural lounges, 
such as the Afro American 
Lounge, have only been 
open 
to 
residents 
who 
completed an orientation 
about the lounge’s history 
and 
rules. 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Thomas 
Oscar, 
vice 
president 
of 
Residence Halls Association 
Executive, 
hoped 
the 
renovations would continue 
to bring safe spaces that are 
inclusive to all students. He 
added that opening up the 
spaces to all students makes 
them more accessible.
“If 
they 
don’t 
have 
knowledge of the room and 
its history, being in the 
room can allow them to get 
that knowledge,” Oscar said. 
“The fact that attention 
is being brought to them 
through 
renovations 
will 
allow people to come and 
learn about the purpose of 
those rooms and what they 
originally stood for.”
While the RHA has not 
yet been requested to give 
input on the spaces, Oscar 
said they would be open 
and willing to give their 
feedback.
“We find this to be an 
important 
moment 
of 
the 
University 
and 
the 
Housing’s history,” Oscar 
said. 
“I 
just 
hope 
that 
there can be a merger of 
functionality and usability 
while 
maintaining 
the 
history.”

grads, it was really up to every 
independent school to make their 
own decision … I did some research 
and put together some information, 
and when we had the meeting with 
the dean, we presented this and the 
dean okayed the new policy to ‘ban 
the box,’ as some people call it.”
 
Welch 
was 
involved 
with UMich Behind Bars and has 
touched on their work at Regents 
meetings, including the February 
2019 meeting. 
 
Since 
Welch 
mostly 
works with people who are inter-
ested in fighting the stigma sur-
rounding 
incarceration 
and 
improving conditions for those who 
are currently incarcerated, he said 
he doesn’t feel racially discrimi-
nated against on a daily basis but is 
still affected by “smaller” aspects of 
discrimination. 
 
“It’s 
strange, 
right?” 
Welch said. “Because for me, my 
background and my story is so 

much of my work that I don’t nec-
essarily every day face the kind of 
prejudices that I know other people 
have. I have a friend who is also a 
(formerly incarcerated person) 
and works at a technology firm 
and his experience has been so 
different from (mine) on the 
micro level. Macro, we’ve kind 
of had the same experience, 
but on a micro level, day to day 
interactions, at the workplace, 
his has been completely differ-
ent from mine.”
 
LSA senior Hannah 
Agnew, president of the stu-
dent executive committee for 
PCAP, said she feels strongly 
about finding ways to eliminate 
the discrimination and social 
stigma surrounding those who 
return after being incarcerated. 
 
Agnew also spoke on 
the value of making Ann Arbor 
an inviting place for those of various 
backgrounds. During her time as a 
sociology major with a crime and 
justice minor, she said she has seen 
powerful insights directly from 
those who come from that back-

ground, rather than just reading 
about it.
 
“I think it’s really impor-
tant to elevate the voices of folks 

who’ve experienced (incarceration) 
and know what the system is like,” 
Agnew said. “And in my personal 
experience, it is so important to have 
folks on campus that have been pre-
viously incarcerated because there’s 

nobody better to learn from.”
 
Welch said he worries 
about his future career at the Uni-
versity as the school hesitates to 

hire those previously convicted of a 
felony. He pointed to the story of his 
friend Asia Johnson, who was not 
hired despite being highly qualified 
for a job. The position entailed shar-
ing her own story of incarceration 

and working with students to fur-
ther the de-stigmatization of incar-
ceration.
 
Johnson attended the 
University before she was con-
victed. She wasn’t able to speak 
to The Daily in time for publi-
cation, but she is continuing to 
pursue a career in reform and 
works as a bail disruptor for The 
Bail Project.
 
In an email to The Daily, 
University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University 
does not turn away students due 
solely to their previous conduct, 
but that it is taken into account.
 
“The University does not 
reject an applicant for admission 
solely because they answered 
‘yes’ to a conduct question, nor 
does it determine applicant eli-
gibility based on past conduct 
history,” Fitzgerald said. “Con-
duct is only reviewed after an appli-
cant is determined to be admissible 
to the university based on a holistic 
review process.”
 
Welch is involved in mul-
tiple communities working to sup-

port those in Ann Arbor who have 
been previously incarcerated. A pre-
viously incarcerated person is still a 
person, Welch said. 
 
“This favorite quote of 
mine, ‘Education is the only thing 
given that cannot be taken,’” Welch 
said. “Oftentimes, we assume that 
just means like collegiate education 
and things like that, but really, any 
type of learning or growing. Spaces 
that (cultivate learning and grow-
ing) have to be created more in Ann 
Arbor because what I found from 
my own personal experience is that 
once someone learns who I am, is 
that I’m just a person, too.” 
 
He said it is important 
to focus on the humanity of those 
affected by incarceration while 
highlighting their struggles.
 
I get sad, and you’d be 
surprised at the things that we have 
in common, but once you know that, 
‘Oh my God, here’s this person that 
grew up completely different from 
me, but we have these things in 
common because we’re both peo-
ple,’” Welch said.

“Our focus is on the social 
roots of sexual assault.” 
Hirsch 
and 
Khan 
said 
their study aims to make 
sexual assault a less common 
feature of college life.
Khan 
discussed 
ways 
to reduce campus sexual 
assault: 
starting 
sexual 
education 
from 
a 
young 
age 
and 
acknowledging 
gender dynamics so that 
people will know what to 
expect as they mature and 
contacting policymakers and 
demanding 
comprehensive 
sexual education.
“Those 
silences 
around 
sex are the kinds of things 
we want to focus on,” Khan 
said. “Refusing sex can be 
awkward, but it’s a teachable 
skill.”
Khan shared a story about 
another Columbia student 
who 
said 
that 
“having 
unwanted sex felt easier 
than 
having 
a 
difficult 
conversation.” He explained 

only 5 percent of sexual 
assault cases on campuses 
are reported, which is likely 
because most victims are 
assaulted by people they 
know. 
Throughout 
the 
event, 
students 
were 
visibly 
nodding 
their 
heads 
in 
agreement as the speakers 
described 
their 
efforts. 
Students were also able to 
text questions to the panel so 
the speakers could elaborate 
on ideas during the event. 
El-Sayed spoke on the 
panel and said he grew up 
in a culture where sex was 
considered “fundamentally 
taboo.”
“I 
have 
a 
2-year-old 
daughter … and I think a lot 
about the world she’s going 
to grow up in,” El-Sayed said. 
“I’m walking into parenting 
without being parented (on 
this issue).”
Khan concluded the event 
with a positive outlook on 
the issue at hand.
“We wanted to give you a 
sense of empathy and hope,” 
he said.

If you come to Ann Arbor, you’re Black 
before you even get to whether or not you 
actually have a felony, right?And if you walk 
down the street in Ann Arbor, you will see 
you don’t belong, because you don’t see 
anybody that looks like you. The only time 
you see somebody else that looks like you is 
in the reflection or a storefront. 

player is a woman, a person 
of color or part of the LGBTQ+ 
community. Christian Sandvig, 
a faculty member in the School 
of Information, spoke about this 
commonality in his introduction of 
Washko. 
“All you have to do is turn on 
the audio and wait,” Sandvig said. 
“I know that there are gamers in 
the audience and I think you know 
what happens next. I mean it’s 
reliable, it only takes a couple of 
minutes before you hear something 
horrific. It is disturbing, offensive, 
it could be racist, it could be sexist, 
homophobic, 
Islamaphobic. 
It 
really thinks of something that 
bothers you and It’s likely to come 
up if you wait long enough.”
To combat the prevalence of 
hate speech, Washko would host 
public 
meetings 
in 
populous 
towns within World of Warcraft. 
Her project gained large scale 
attention in World of Warcraft and 
an intentional inclusive in-game 
guild was created as a part of 
these discussions. Washko’s work 
was displayed in galleries though 
large-scale projections of these 
conversations, as well as in writing. 
While this wasn’t the first time 
Washko promoted feminism in 
her pieces, this project became a 
baseline for future works.
The second project Washko 
spoke about was an online video 
game titled The Game: The Game. 
A play on words of the book “The 
Game: Penetrating the Secret 
Society of Pickup Artists” by Neil 
Strauss, The Game: The Game 
players navigate the world of 
“Pickup Artist Gurus,” featuring 
real-life gurus, who approach 
players using the tactics the gurus 

market as successful in on their 
websites, online modules, books 
and lectures. 
The Game: The Game is based 
on Washko’s research in the 
community, which she called 
misogynistic 
alt-right 
or 
the 
Manosphere. In The Game: The 
Game, players have to interact with 
“pickup artists” who aim to seduce 
the player, blurring the lines of 
consent and manipulating women 
into sleeping with them. 
Washko was able to get an online 
Skype interview with “pickup 
artist” Guru Roosh V, a notorious 
figure in the Manosphere, as part 
of her research, but she said she 
had to act submissive and ditzy 
and cater to what Roosh wanted 
to talk about to keep the interview 
running smoothly. 
“If you don’t feel like a creep 
you’re not pushing hard enough,” 
Washko read from one of Roosh’s 
books. “You must always be making 
the first move. You must always be 
pushing. If you’re scared that she’s 
going to think you’re a creep, that 
means you’re on the right path.” 
Following her vocal criticism of 
Roosh, his online community began 
harassing Washko on social media 
platforms, though direct messages, 
in comments in new stories and 
across the internet. Washko noted 
the difference in reactions between 
the World of Warcraft community 
and the Manosphere was related 
to her personal position within the 
communities.
“In WoW, I was recognizable as 
a long term, a high-level member 
of the community with high-level 
gear only obtained through years of 
commitment to the game,” Washko 
said. “Clearly a participant in that 
space and not outside. By virtue of 
just being myself, a woman, a self-
identified feminist, a person with a 

job, I would always be an outsider 
in the manosphere.” 
Washko played videos from the 
creators as part of the lecture.
Art & Design senior Elizabeth 
Doyle commented on the impact of 
those videos.
“I found a lot of it difficult to 
watch and disturbing,” Doyle said. 
“A lot of the men she was focusing 
on in the beginning were really, 
really disturbing and hard to 
watch.”
While the content of The 
Game: The Game is in some cases 
disturbing, 
Washko 
said 
she 
didn’t create it to unsettle players. 
Instead, she said she wanted to 
create a platform where players 
can better understand what it feels 
like to be a target of these target 
techniques. 
Washko also commented on the 
personal impact of delving into 
the Manosphere and this online 
community and spoke about how 
her current project is almost a polar 
opposite of what she has worked on 
in the past. 
Washko finished the lecture 
with a bold outlook at what she 
wants to do with her art. 
“I have had a commitment to 
examining the cultural byproducts 
of 
media 
and 
entertainment, 
not only in an effort to rethink 
them and create hopefully future 
cultural objects that are more 
inclusive in a wide range of ways 
that we choose as humans to 
perform and present, live and 
love,” Washko said. “And I hope 
to continue to tell what I think is 
complex, underrepresented and 
unconventional 
stories 
about 
the media that we consume 
from 
unusual 
perspectives 
using a wide range of forms and 
distribution strategies.”

“The standard for surviving a 
motion to dismiss is incredibly 
low,” Deutsch said. “To beat a 
motion to dismiss, a plaintiff 
basically 
just 
needs 
to 
have stated in their initial 
complaint the elements of 
each legal claim and facts 
backing them up. The facts 

don’t even need to turn out to 
be true.”
Deutsch 
explained 
the 
discovery 
will 
be 
a 
long, 
expensive 
and 
resource-
intensive process that could 
last several months. He said 
he anticipates the defendants 
will then move to summary 
judgment.
“On summary judgment, the 
judge is asked to decide the case 
without a trial if he feels that 
there are no facts in legitimate 

dispute,” Deutsch said. “This 
will be tougher for the AFLC to 
overcome, because at that point, 
the AFLC will need to have a 
case backed by evidence that a 
jury could plausibly believe.”
Muise 
denies 
allegations 
of criminal activity. He said 
the AFLC’s reputation as well 
as 
financial 
contributions 
have suffered as a result of 
being designated a hate group 
by the SPLC, and expressed 
frustration with government 

officials legitimizing the report. 
“We’ve been fighting the 
credibility of this … spending 
a lot of time and resources 
to launch press releases, to 
get in the media, to counter 
the media’s reliance on the 
Southern Poverty Law Center, 
because it does harm us,” 
Muise said. “And now all of a 
sudden you have the Michigan 
attorney general, the state’s top 
law enforcement office, saying, 
‘Oh no, this is a legitimate 

list.’ It’s just raised this to 
another level ... it’s given the 
state’s endorsement to it, it has 
dedicated state’s resources to it 
— this is horrific.”
Nessel and Arbulu’s press 
release defines a “hate and 
bias incident” as one which 
“an 
action 
does 
not 
rise 
to the level of a crime or a 
civil 
infraction,” 
including 
actions protected by the First 
Amendment. According to the 
press release, the database 

initiative is intended to educate 
the community about such 
incidents and combat them. 
Muise believes this initiative 
infringes 
on 
constitutional 
rights.
“No attorney general should 
weaponize 
their 
office 
to 
go after political opponents 
and even threaten to go after 
political opponents, because it 
obviously has a chilling effect 
on the right to freedom of 
speech,” Muise said.

DECRIMINALIZE NATURE ANN ARBOR | OP-ED

Ann Arbor, destigmatize psychedelics

R 

ecently, MLive published 
a brief article covering 
Decriminalize 
Nature 
Ann Arbor (DNA2) and our 
movement 
to 
destigmatize 
and decriminalize an array of 
psychedelic plants and fungi which 
have been shown, by a quickly 
accumulating mass of clinical and 
scientific evidence, to be invaluable 
tools in a variety of therapeutic 
settings. Not coincidentally, many 
of these same plants and fungi are 
considered sacred by indigenous 
cultures across the world, and 
play key roles in their spiritual and 
ceremonial life.
The impetus for this MLive 
article was the recent release of our 
resolution to the City Council of 
Ann Arbor. It is a carefully worded 
and 
thoroughly 
researched 
proposal for legislation which will 
end the harmful, unnecessary 
prohibition of these uniquely 
beneficial 
substances, 
known 
collectively 
as 
“entheogens.” 
The article attempts to gauge the 
initial responses of a handful of 
councilmembers to this proposed 
legislation. 
The 
results 
are 
disappointing.
The MLive piece includes a 
statement from Councilmember 
Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2, who 
dismisses 
the 
Decriminalize 
Nature movement as “folks who 
want to bring back the good-old 
hippie days,” before making a 
reference to Jefferson Airplane’s 
“White Rabbit,” for some reason. 
Lumm’s statement is reductive 
and in bad faith. Apparently, she 
didn’t actually read our resolution, 
and she chose to completely ignore 
the resolution’s 60-plus medical, 
scientific and scholarly citations 
which 
support 
our 
position. 
Instead she chose to recite lyrics 
from a worn-out staple of classic 
rock radio. With all due respect 
to Councilmember Lumm, she 
seems to be the one looking 
backward, perhaps to a sterile, 
idealized 1950s that never existed 
in the first place. DNA2 has its eye 
on the future. We are not looking 
backward, to the “good-old hippie 
days” of the 1960s. We are looking 
ahead to the 2020s, the decade 
when 
psychedelic 
medicine 
and entheogenic spirituality go 
mainstream.
Another 
councilmember 
interviewed by MLive is Jack 
Eaton, D-Ward 4, who seems more 
sympathetic to our cause, but who 
still resorts to unjustified alarmism 
and a misleading conception of the 
60s and its legacy. “I’m aware of 
a lot of the research that’s been 
done, but I don’t have a really good 
grasp of how we could deregulate 
this and not end up right back 
in the late 60s,” Eaton said. If 
we understand Councilmember 
Eaton correctly, “the late 60s” 
is meant as shorthand for the 

excesses and public health issues 
that did, admittedly, appear during 
the hippie-era drug culture. But 
this picture ignores the “harm 
reduction” practices and policies 
that have emerged in the decades 
since, as a counter to these risks.
Harm reduction is an emphasis 
for DNA2 and its members, 
as it is for most currently 
active 
psychedelic 
groups 
and 
organizations 
including 
Michigan DanceSafe and the 
Michigan 
Psychedelic 
Society. 
This picture also sidesteps the 
growing realization that most 
of the potential for harm with 
entheogens — or any controlled 
substances, for that matter — stems 
from the fact that they are illegal. 
Prohibition does little to deter 
drug use; it simply drives it into 
the shadows and thus increases 
the potential for misuse and abuse. 
Deregulation is the first step 
toward a healthier relationship 
with these substances. It will 
allow everyone to use entheogens 
openly and safely, with education 
and clarity.
In the MLive article, Eaton 
goes on to say, “I think that it 
really has to start with the federal 
government taking it off from 
the Schedule I list of drugs.” This 
insistence that entheogens must 
be removed from Schedule I of the 
Controlled Substances Act before 
they can be made available for 
medical, spiritual and recreational 
use is a tactic of delay and 
deflection. After all, marijuana 
is still classified by the federal 
government as a Schedule I drug, 
and yet here we are: Michigan 
residents are free to enjoy the 
medical 
and 
psychological 
benefits of legal cannabis, and the 
world is still turning.
To return briefly to the topic of 
the 60s and its legacy, it’s worth 
noting that both Lumm and Eaton 
ignore the positive aspects of that 
legacy. They give us a caricature 
of 
hippie 
hedonism, 
while 
omitting the crucial influence 
of hippie counterculture on the 
progressive politics and social 
justice movements of our own 
era. Perhaps the most enduring 
legacy of 60s counterculture was 
its central role in the emerging 
environmental 
movement. 
There’s a recurring, undeniable 
relationship between psychedelic 
experience and environmental 
awareness, between entheogens 
and 
the 
realization 
of 
a 
fundamental continuity between 
humanity and nature, as well 
as 
the 
recognition 
that 
the 
complexity of the natural world 
is fragile and cannot be taken 
for granted. During this most 
uncertain of times, when every 
day confronts us with the signs of 
impending global environmental 
catastrophe, such environmental 

awareness is a moral imperative 
and a necessity for our survival 
as a species. To deny our citizens 
access to entheogenic substances 
which facilitate such awareness 
is an unethical act, one which 
subsequent generations will not 
judge kindly. 
Again, we’re not here to litigate 
(and re-litigate, over and over 
again) the legacy of the 60s. We’re 
not here to talk about the past. 
That’s a distraction. We’re here 
to discuss our shared present 
and our potential for a brighter 
future. The decriminalization 
of entheogenic plants and fungi 
is a matter of utmost, existential 
urgency, and should be a priority 
for the Ann Arbor City Council. 
It’s 
absurd 
that 
obviously 
destructive drugs such as alcohol 
and tobacco remain legal, while 
these natural substances with 
relatively 
little 
destructive 
potential are illegal. The 2017 
Global Drug Survey concluded 
that the psilocybin in “magic 
mushrooms” is the safest, least 
toxic recreational drug currently 
in use.
Some 
members 
of 
City 
Council may continue to resist 
and delay, but our momentum 
will carry decriminalization 
forward. 
The 
clinical 
and 
scientific 
evidence 
for 
the 
many benefits of entheogens is 
weighty and ever-accumulating, 
and this is being recognized 
by cities and states across 
the country. In May 2019, 
the citizens of Denver, Colo., 
voted to decriminalize magic 
mushrooms. In June 2019, the 
City Council of Oakland, Calif., 
voted, unanimously, in favor 
of the decriminalization of 
entheogenic plants and fungi. In 
October, Chicago’s Committee 
on Health and Human Relations 
voted unanimously in favor of a 
similar resolution, which is now 
pending before its City Council. 
Last week, the Santa Cruz, Calif., 
City Council followed suit, also 
by unanimous vote. And on Feb. 
6, the District of Columbia took 
its first steps toward making 
decriminalization 
a 
ballot 
measure in November.
Ann Arbor has a history and 
a reputation as one of the most 
forward-thinking cities in the 
Midwest, if not the country. 
Will 
its 
current 
leadership 
honor 
that 
reputation, 
or 
tarnish it by attempting to delay 
the inevitable? The members 
of Decriminalize Nature Ann 
Arbor are looking toward a 
brighter, healthier, saner future, 
and we urge City Council to join 
us in doing the same.

FROM THE DAILY

Don’t panic over coronavirus outbreak
A

s of Thursday morning, the New York Times reported that there are 12 cases 

of the coronavirus in the United States, including six cases in California and 

two in Chicago. The announcement came after the first confirmed U.S. case 

arose in Washington State over two weeks ago. While the illness has barely made its way 

to the U.S., the lack of understanding surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus’s contagion 

and cure has placed the issue at the forefront of American consciousness. This attention, 

compounded with a 24-hour news cycle, has captured the West’s attention for days on 

end. While media coverage can often over-dramatize public health crises like this one, 

The Michigan Daily Editorial Board believes this attention remains especially imperative 

given China’s opaque nature in discussing the thousands of cases within their country.

A report from the Washington 
Post recently said the Chinese 
government has quarantined 
over 35 million people. The 
same article referenced several 
public health experts worried 
that these drastic measures 
will serve to undercut the trust 
between the Chinese population 
and its public health officials, 
a move that could prevent 
those infected from receiving 
the 
correct 
education 
and 
treatment. While the American 
media may be overreacting 
to the few confirmed cases 
within U.S. borders, their over-
coverage may prove important 
in 
accumulating 
the 
most 
accurate information possible 
if the Chinese government 
continues to operate with a lack 
of transparency. 
While 
accurate 
coverage 
is important, University of 
Michigan students and the Ann 
Arbor community alike should 
keep in mind the warnings of 
public health officials to avoid 
any apocalyptic predictions and 
hysteria, as “Americans should 
not worry for their own safety.” 
In typical fashion, social media 
has had a significant response, 
with a plethora of memes about 
the virus populating Facebook 
and Twitter feeds. While humor 
can be a coping mechanism, 
this 
memetic 
social 
media 
reaction could contribute to 
misinformation 
and 
undue 
panic. 
More 
locally, 
the 
University has responded to the 
outbreak in an official capacity, 
issuing a travel restriction on 
the entire country of China 
and cautioning U-M affiliates 
to 
avoid 
all 
non-essential 
travel to the area. While these 
diligent responses are meant 
to protect the U-M community, 
it is important to maintain the 
line between “urging vigilance 
without inciting panic.” As a 
diverse and global institution, 
we must avoid any rhetoric or 
practices that forcefully divide 
Asian-American 
students 
or 
any other members of the U-M 
community. While the disease 

may not seem like an immediate 
threat to the U.S., we should 
keep in mind the many real 
lives being impacted by the 
outbreak, making an effort to 
be attentive to our community 
rather than alienating.
This certainly is not the 
first time we have seen such 
widespread hysteria over a 
novel disease. In 2003, Severe 
Acute 
Respiratory 
System 
(SARS), another member of 
the coronavirus family, caused 
similar panic when 29 of the 
8,098 reported cases occurred 
in the U.S. — yet none of these 
patients died. Similarly, panics 
over Bird flu, Ebola virus and 
Zika virus have all garnered 
significant 
media 
coverage 
and societal alarm. In each 

instance, reported cases in the 
U.S. composed a small minority 
of worldwide infections and 
deaths. The coverage of Wuhan 
coronavirus 
seems 
to 
be 
following this trend. It seems 
panic is often generated over 
the most new and noteworthy 
diseases — not necessarily the 
most dangerous ones. 
On the other hand, the 
common flu kills an average 
of 35,000 people each year, 
hospitalizing about 200,000. 
In 2018, the flu took its highest 
toll in 40 years, causing 80,000 
American 
deaths. 
These 
numbers serve as a reminder 
that we should always be 
diligent 
about 
protecting 
our 
health 
against 
both 
newsworthy 
and 
seemingly 
mundane 
illnesses. 
The 
defenses are relatively simple: 

disinfect 
porous 
surfaces, 
avoid touching your face and 
wash your hands frequently. 
Additionally, 
everyone 
who 
is able should be proactive in 
receiving the flu vaccine every 
year. U-M offers flu shots at 
walk-in clinics for students, 
faculty and staff throughout 
the fall and early winter, or 
through appointment at UHS.
Finally, it’s important to keep 
in mind that the greatest threats 
to human health in America 
are much less newsworthy 
than the Wuhan coronavirus 
or other infectious diseases. 
Chronic 
illnesses 
have 
a 
significant impact in the U.S., 
with heart disease and cancer 
being the leading causes of 
death by a significant margin. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
defenses 
to these health issues aren’t 
as simple as good hygiene. A 
more structural reform will 
be necessary to tackle these 
causes of death, one involving 
health 
policy, 
nutrition, 
insurance markets and more. 
Every 
time 
a 
hot-button 
disease makes headlines, it’s 
important to keep in mind the 
less glamorous reality of health 
in the U.S., and what we should 
be doing to improve it.
Regardless 
of 
novelty, 
everyone 
should 
always 
take public health seriously. 
Good hygiene, proper hand-
washing and updated flu 
shots may feel like small 
acts on the individual level, 
but when taken in context 
of 
a 
larger 
population, 
these 
simple 
habits 
are 
exceptionally 
powerful 
in 
keeping everyone healthy — 
especially those with pre-
existing 
conditions 
that 
place them at higher risk for 
health complications due to 
illness. We as the Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board urge 
the U-M community to stay 
informed 
for 
updates 
on 
the coronavirus and use the 
illness as an opportunity to 
check in with our regular 
public health habits.

M 

y 
parents 
are 
immigrants, so in our 
household, food is the 
center of everything. That means 
you don’t refuse food even if you 
just ate. While I’m not the biggest 
foodie, my parents would take food 
preparation very seriously, so I grew 
to love cooking over the years. I was 
never a natural, but my mom insisted 
that I learn all the traditional family 
recipes. What I once thought of as a 
tedious chore became the foundation 
for an appreciation of my culture and 
the art of food preparation. Grocery 
shopping is the most important 
task for the Shah family’s process. 
It includes two kinds of trips: the 
routine run to our local grocery store 
with my mom, or a more special 
trip to my city’s farmer’s market 
with my grandpa. While the former 
is a speedy encounter, Saturday 
farmer’s markets were a religious 
experience. My grandpa would say 
hello to his favorite local business 
owners, and we’d pick out beautiful, 
fresh produce. Hours later, we’d head 
home, content with our selection. 
The occasional trip to Whole 
Foods, however, was a completely 
different 
experience. 
While 
I 
reluctantly forgive the overpriced 
produce, I can’t help but scoff at the 
shelves stacked with lentil soup that 
pale in comparison to my mom’s 
recipe. Here, my grandpa would 
have no one to talk to. Instead, I see 
a man debating between the free-
range and grass-fed chicken eggs. I 
see a kid pick up a box of 100 percent 
fruit strips with no added flavors or 
sugars. Although I support the raw 
foods lifestyle, I always thought some 
of it was a little extreme. But who am 
I to comment on another individual’s 

grocery shopping predilections? And 
by any means, I had some intense 
restocking to accomplish according 
to my highly organized list.
A part of me recognized the 
facade of Whole Foods, but it was 
one of those things I seemed to be 
better off unbothered with. But 
when I had finished reading the 
section of Michael Pollan’s “The 
Omnivore’s 
Dilemma” 
on 
Big 
Organic for my Food, Energy, and 
Environmental Justice class last 
semester, my shy animosity toward 
Whole Foods escalated. I take pride 
in my culture, so when I see a brand 
that has industrialization embedded 
into its production narrative try 
and preach authenticity, I get a 
little defensive — to that and seeing 
jars of my grandmother’s cure-all 
“Golden Milk” instant mix placed 
methodically in the front of the bulk 
spices aisle. I mean, come on, get 
your own god damn culture.
It’s 
understood 
that 
as 
globalization continues, cultural 
diffusion is inevitable — it’s 
encouraged even. And what is 
the American Dream if not an 
expansion of ideas and ways of 
life? However, for America and 
its premature industrialization 
of food, ahead lies a consequently 
unpromising road to culture and 
the craft of food preparation. 
Time and time again, these 
attempts 
to 
reconcile 
the 
mass production of processed 
food acquiesce at the hand of 
convenience. In that respect, 
countries of lower socioeconomic 
status seem to be at an advantage 
because their circumstances led 
them to care about how food 
was made available. And that 

care continually nurtured their 
culture. It’s what makes food 
preparation such a big deal in 
many countries, and it’s why 
culture cannot simply be bought 
in a can of ultra-pasteurized goat 
milk.
Don’t get me wrong — I’m a big 
fan of organic, and I think the 
campaign for it is a noble one. 
Big Organic is a term coined for 
the progressive movement in 
agriculture and food production 
promoting organic and sustainable 
farming over existing industrial 
practices. This is good. Organic 
is good, and consumers should 
support brands that practice 
sustainable 
farming 
methods. 
Especially if it means endorsing 
local stories over the narrative of 
capitalism. But when businesses 
like Whole Foods want and expect 
their organic suppliers to operate 
at a larger scale, Pollan poses the 
overarching question best: “Is 
industrial organic ultimately a 
contradiction in terms?” Short 
answer: It is. Whole Foods strives 
to emphasize their “commitment 
to the local farmer” but unless 
their “local farmer” is a large scale 
organic farm in California, this 
is nothing but false advertising. 
A large portion of Whole Foods’s 
shelf space is accorded to big 
brands, wiping away all the 
underdogs, if they haven’t already 
been absorbed into the larger 
ones.

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

I had no idea of what to 
expect out of the Iowa Caucus 
Concert featuring Bon Iver, but 
when Senator Bernie Sanders 
announces 
he’s 
holding 
a 
concert to rally supporters and 
by circumstance you’re already 
going to be in the correct state, 
you find a way to get to that 
concert.
I woke up in Ann Arbor at 5 
a.m. that morning and drove all 
the way to Iowa with another 
Michigan Daily journalist and 
a photographer to report on 
the pre-caucus activities in the 
state. By the time we arrived at 
the concert venue — Horizons 
Event Center in Clive, Iowa 
— at 4 p.m. on Friday, we’d 
already 
interviewed 
several 
Iowans about their feelings on 
the caucus, trailed around a 
group of University of Michigan 
students canvassing for Senator 
Elizabeth Warren and eaten 
lunch at the World’s Largest 
Truck Stop. That’s all to say: 
We’d been busy. 
Since this wasn’t just any 
concert — this was a Bernie 
Sanders 
Caucus 
Concert 
— 
there was an hour of Iowan 
folk bands to open the show, 
2 hours of energetic political 
speeches 
from 
Sanders’ 
political surrogates (the senator 
himself was stuck in D.C. for 
the impeachment trials) and 
then about 45 minutes of Justin 
Vernon closing out the show 
with a solo acoustic set. I wasn’t 
used to this Iowa reporting 
schedule of 18-hour days, so 
by the time Justin Vernon took 
the stage at 9 p.m., I was pretty 
damn exhausted.
Still, I left the press area 
— buzzing with professional 
journalists all very excited to 
be at this rather unusual event 
— and planted myself squarely 
in the middle of the crowd 
for Vernon’s set. About 2,000 
people had turned out to support 
Bernie and see Bon Iver, and as 
far as I could tell, it wasn’t much 
different from the crowd at a 
packed university co-op party. 
I’d never seen more rolled-
up beanies, circular glasses 
frames or Doc Martens in one 
space before. People of all ages 
had come out to see the show 
(there were multiple babies in 

attendance!), but the majority 
of attendees looked between the 
ages of 18 and 30, which checks 
out, considering Sanders’ appeal 
to young voters. The crowd 
was energized by the call, and 
screamed when Vernon took the 
stage, just as they had during 
the rallying cries of the political 
figures who’d spoken earlier in 
the evening. The couple next 
to me looked so thrilled by the 
combination of Bernie and Bon 
Iver that I thought they might 
jump each other right there 
in the middle of the Horizons 
Event Center. 
The feeling in the event 
center 
shifted 
suddenly, 
though. Vernon, who hails from 
Wisconsin, opened his set with 
a cover of Bob Dylan’s “With 
God on Your Side.” When he 

croned “the country I come 
from is called the Midwest,” the 
audience cheered, but far more 
softly than they had earlier. A 
man to my right wearing a cow 
print baseball cap and sporting 
a thick mustache (no beard) 
swayed from side to side. I 
felt whiplashed; the softness 
of Vernon provided a stark 
contrast to the angry radical 
energy that had precipitated 
the room just before he took the 
stage. 

The 
tonal 
shift 
left 
me 
feeling 
confused 
and 
even 
more exhausted. My back hurt 
from standing for so long in 
bad shoes. Plus I wanted to 
see how professional political 
journalists were treating this 
caucus concert. 
Out 
of 
respect 
for 
the 
Midwestern energy in the room, 
I “excused me”-d and “pardon 
me”-d back to the press area. But 
when I got back there, the tables 
were almost entirely empty. 
Gone were all the laptops, 
voice recorders and cameras. 
Everyone 
seemed 
to 
have 
gone home to their company-
expensed motels. I thought back 
to the buzz I’d felt emanating 
off the other reporters in the 
press area before diving into 
the crowd of Bernie supporters 
and Bon Iver fans. Had it just 
been an excitement to leave the 
event? 
I felt betrayed, in a way. A 
free Bon Iver concert that you 
get paid to go to! Sure, for an 
arts and culture journalist, 
no big deal. But for a political 
reporter? That doesn’t happen 
every day! Covering 2020 is a 
serious job, but I felt like no one 
should be above having a little 
fun at a free concert. 
Disappointed, I didn’t want 
to go back into the crowd, but 
I couldn’t see Vernon from the 
press tables, so I walked up the 
stairs to the small press balcony. 
The balcony also had a view of 
the stage, but an even better 
view of the press area below, 
and as I counted the number 
of 
journalists 
who’d 
stuck 
around on my fingers, I noticed 
someone I hadn’t seen before: 
One lone journalist sat asleep in 
her chair at a press table, head 
down on the cold plastic. 
As 
I 
looked 
at 
this 
sleeping comrade, I realized 
the 
heaviness 
of 
my 
own 
exhaustion. Sure, I loved Bon 
Iver as much as the next guy. But 
I’d been working for 15 hours 
at that point. The newsworthy 
part of this event had come 
and gone. I didn’t need to be 
there, and frankly, I wanted to 
be asleep, too. I decided to cut 
the other journalists — who’d 
probably been working 18-hour 
days in Iowa for weeks now — 
some slack. We were all tired. 
We could pay to see Bon Iver 
another time. Let’s all go back to 
our motel rooms and go to sleep. 

Pre-caucus Iowa: Bon Iver, 
Bernie and lots of beanies

MAYA GOLDMAN
For The Daily

Warning: 
“Dear 
Edward” 
is not meant for the faint-
hearted or anyone with a fear 
of flying. “Dear Edward” by 
Ann Napolitano is the story of a 
young boy, Edward, who is the 
sole survivor of a plane crash 
that took the lives of his family 
and the other 186 passengers. 
The book shifts from Edward’s 
present-day perspective to those 
of eight other distinct characters 
on the flight, tracking their 
experiences 
from 
 
boarding 
the plane to the final moments 
preluding its fatal crash. 
The intensive buildup leaves 
the reader craving to read more, 
and the dramatic irony of the 
plane’s inevitable crash steadily 
heightens as you delve deep into 
the minds of the passengers: their 
problems, struggles, regrets — all 

of which seem minuscule under 
the weight of death waiting to 
take them all. All but Edward. 
Several issues are brought to 
light through these characters: 
abusive relationships, sexuality 
struggles and identity crises. 
“Dear Edward” is not a fairytale; 
just like the unpredictability 
of life, the plane crash is not 
something 
for 
which 
the 
characters are prepared. They 
are not actors who know how 
the 
scene 
ends, 
characters 
experiencing 
a 
flashback 
or 
omniscient narrators of their 
experiences. Having the story 
told as a novel makes it more 
engaging, more real and more 
devastating 
to 
witness 
the 
evolution of each character’s 
priorities and dispositions before 
they collectively sink into their 
imminent deaths.
The 
increasingly 
chaotic 
setting on the plane contrasts 
from that of the solemn and quiet 

perspective of Edward. While 
Edward’s chapters focus on him 
as an individual, the chapters 
occurring on the plane switch 
frequently and rapidly between 
the specified eight characters 
onboard. Accustomed to the 
isolation of characters usually 
exhibited in YA novels, I initially 
found 
the 
constant 
shifting 
difficult to follow. Nevertheless, 
because each character is so 
unique (an injured soldier, a 
dying 
Wall-Street 
sensation 
and 
a 
free-spirited 
woman 
amongst the eight), a sort of 
rhythm is established within 
the perspective shifts and it 
becomes easier to decipher who 
is who, solely based on the voice 
Napolitano uses for the eight 
characters. 
While the plane chapters 
were 
always 
gripping 
and 
suspenseful, leaving the reader 
waiting for the realization of the 
unavoidable terror, they were 

often very similar. The shift 
between the characters aided 
the range of these chapters, 
but often it felt repetitive with 
each character retelling their 
increasingly apathetic thoughts. 
The anticipation of the crash 
initiated 
at 
the 
beginning 
preemptively 
made 
these 
sections seem tedious and dull 
until the height of the conflict 
arose. 
Until the real drama finally 
makes its appearance, Edward’s 
chapters maintain the reader’s 
interest. When first introduced, 
Edward is Eddie: the innocent 
12-year old boy preparing for his 

family’s move to Los Angeles. 
Soon, 
though, 
he 
becomes 
Edward, the boy that readers 
are desperate to protect. He is 
physically 
weak, 
emotionally 
destroyed and achingly lonely. 
Time passes slowly for him; 
he 
does 
not 
overcome 
his 
trauma quickly — or even at all 
— by the time the novel ends. 
Napolitano shows that healing 
is not something that happens 
overnight. The false expectation 
can complicate dealing with 
trauma in one’s own life, but 
Edward’s story is reassuring 
in that his problems are not 
miraculously solved.

Competitive reality TV truly 
benefits from the weekly release 
format of cable and channel 
television. You have a week to 
ruminate on the show after 
watching an hour of action and 
drama that falls upon your favorite 
contestant. The week-long break 
in between each airing gives 
the viewer a chance to debrief, 
discuss and process the episode 
before repeating the cycle with 
the next week’s episode. By the 
next episode’s release, you may 
not care about the rote, repetitive 
nature of the competition and its 
dramatic editing. While watching 
competitive reality TV you may 
wonder if Netflix’s binge-
worthy episodes provide 
a better alternative.
Netflix’s 
“Next 
in 
Fashion” is the streaming 
giant’s latest foray into 
the realm of fashion 
and competitive reality 
TV. Similar to “Project 
Runway,” 
“Next 
in 
Fashion” tries to find 
a fresh and talented 
designer who will be 
awarded 
a 
$250,000 
investment toward their 
own brand, as well as 
an opportunity to sell 
their designs through 
online retailer Net-a-Porter. All 
designers, unlike competitors from 
shows such as “Master Chef,” are 
professionals within the fashion 
design trade; most have their own 
brands, while some have even 
ghost-designed 
under 
celebrity 
brands. “Next in Fashion” pits 
the contestants, initially paired in 
teams of two, to create stunning 
looks that will be judged on a 
catwalk. Contestants that do not 
meet the judges’ approval are sent 
home.

Tan France and Alexa Chung, 
the hosts of “Next in Fashion,” 
provide tongue-in-cheek humor 
that 
provides 
levity 
to 
the 
otherwise tense and often chaotic 
environment within each episode. 
Assisting France and Chung are 
industry heavyweights who judge 
each 
contestant’s 
submission. 
While 
entertaining, 
“Next 
in 
Fashion” reveals a fair number 
of problematic behavior mostly 
through the critiques from guest 
judges and the hosts.
The show’s attempts to find 
the 
most 
forward-thinking 
designers come across as elitist 
and economically privileged. In an 
episode where the challenge was 
to create suits, France and guest 
judge Jason Bolden disregarded 
outfits that looked “cheap” and 
“not expensive.” These criticisms 

ironically came after Tan France’s 
“Fashion Tip” segment in which 
he advised contestants to opt for a 
cheap, yet tailored suit compared to 
an expensive one. 
“Next in Fashion” rears its 
most problematic side during the 
critiquing segments of its two Black 
contestants, Kianga ‘KiKi’ Milele 
and Farai Simoyi-Agdebe. In the 
aforementioned 
suit 
challenge, 
the judges criticized Kiki and 
Farai’s 
practical 
interpretation 
of a woman’s power suit. In the 

subsequent episode, despite Kiki’s 
prodigious 
expertise 
within 
streetwear, the hosts and judges— 
save for guest judge Kerby Jean-
Raymond — heavily criticized the 
“unfinished” look of their outfit, an 
intentional design decision by Kiki. 
It is only Kerby’s stalwart refusal to 
disqualify Kiki and Farai that saves 
the duo from being disqualified. 
For a moment, you hold out hoping 
that “Next in Fashion” breaks the 
appropriation and commodification 
of Black culture and design by 
established, predominantly white, 
clothing labels and designers. And 
for that moment, it does pass; Kiki 
and Farai are not disqualified from 
the round. 
Yet, 
Kiki 
and 
Farai 
are 
disqualified in the next round, 
which 
involves 
lingerie. 
Tan 
France and Victoria’s Secret model 
Adriana Lima’s criticisms 
of Kiki and Farai’s design 
revolve around a supposed 
lack of breast support and 
a lack of “perky breasts.” 
Though Kiki and Farai’s 
lingerie design revolved 
around women’s comfort 
and also showed detailed 
construction of a breast 
support system, Kiki and 
Farai 
are 
disqualified 
nonetheless. Those who do 
not prescribe to the white 
heteronormative standards 
of beauty, including Kiki 
and Farai, are sent out of the 
competition.
Equally puzzling are the host 
and guest judges’ fascination with 
the two East Asian contestants: 
Angel Chen and Minju Kim. 
While the two contestants receive 
praise from Tan France and Alexa 
Chung, you wonder if it stems 
from an extant fetishization of 
East Asian culture from a Western 
perspective rather than a genuine 
applause 
towards 
the 
design 
process of both Angel and Minju.

SUNDANCE FILM REVIEW
Sundance 2020: ‘Minari’ is brilliant

TRINAL PAL
Daily Arts Writer

The opening scene of “Minari” is simple yet 
telling. The Yi family drives their moving truck 
through rural Arkansas, hesitant disgust on the 
mother’s face, eager expectation on her husband’s. 
They stop in the middle of a grassy enclosure and 
the camera pans to what the family sees — a mobile 
home, covered in drab gray and brown paint. The 
children run out, exclaiming, “Look! Our house 
has wheels!”
What better symbol of false hope, the American 
Dream thrown into disarray, than a shabbily 
painted mobile home in the middle of nowhere? 
As the children frantically jump into the house 
to start exploring, their mother hides her face 
with her hands, wisps of her black hair barely 
concealing the tears in her eyes. This wasn’t what 
she was promised. Dull resignation settling over 
her face, she clumsily climbs inside.
“Minari” — directed by Lee Isaac Chung 
(“Munyurangabo”) — follows the Yi family, 

Korean immigrants who move from California 
to Arkansas for hopes of better pay for their 
profession, chicken sexing (sorting female 
chicks from male chicks for 
egg production). Jacob (Steven 
Yeun, 
“Burning”) 
dreams 
of 
starting a farm, and convinces 
his wife Monica (Han Yeri, 
“Worst Woman”) to come along, 
disguising his grand schemes 
under the pretense of a “garden.” 
Their children, David (Alan S. 
Kim in his debut film) and Anne 
(Noel Cho in her debut film) are 
enthusiastic about moving, but 
bored out of their minds when they finally reach 
Arkansas. Monica’s mother Soonja (Yuh Jung 
Youn, “Woman of Fire”) moves from South Korea 
to stay with them, and the tale of the chaotic and 
hilarious Yi family kicks off.
“Minari” may have a conventional plot — 
immigrant stories of chasing the American 
dream are plentiful in film — but this one is 

executed to perfection. Dark, somber scenes 
are complemented (often times immediately) by 
heartwarming family shots, so much so that I felt 
I was living right alongside the 
Yi’s, watching everything play out 
in real time. I walked out of the 
theater knowing that “Minari” 
would make it big, and it did, 
winning the arguable top accolade 
of Sundance, the U.S. Dramatic 
grand jury prize and the Audience 
Award. A24 plans to release the 
film in theaters later this year, 
where I’m confident it will win 
over the hearts of many. 
After a whole weekend of watching Sundance 
films, the animated performances of the cast of 
“Minari” set it apart from its competitors. Kim 
may be one of the most talented child actors I’ve 
seen.

‘Telsa’ is postmodern boredom

It was a full house at the screening of “Tesla” 
I attended in Salt Lake City. Sundance attendees 
filled up a magnificent theatre with a capacity of 
well over a thousand. I wasn’t closely following 
which films were the ones to look out for at 
Sundance 2020, so I had no idea it would draw 
such a huge audience. Bystanders clamored 
outside the theatre for someone to give up their 
tickets. But the excitement didn’t surprise me. 
Everyone loves an underdog story, and festival 
goers were appropriately amped to see a biopic on 
the internet’s darling martyr of scientific history.
I’m not sure what I expected from a biopic 
about Nikola Tesla, but the movie turned my 
undefined expectation on its head. It is a wholly 
weird, fourth-wall-breaking work of avant-garde 
artistry. The film is narrated by J.P. Morgan’s 
daughter Anne (Eve Hewson, “Robin Hood”), who 
sets the scenes with a MacBook and a projector. 

Nikola Tesla (Ethan Hawke, “The Kid”) and 
Thomas Edison (Kyle MacLachlan, “The House 
with a Clock in Its Walls”) have a historically 
inaccurate ice cream fight. Ethan 
Hawke sings a karaoke rendition 
of Tears For Fears’s 1985 hit 
“Everybody Wants To Rule The 
World,” all while in-character as 
Tesla. I shit you not.
While “Tesla” is sometimes 
hilarious — even if its intent is 
sometimes ambiguous — it’s 
mostly terrible. It is a genuinely 
boring film through and through, 
trading the constraints of logical 
narrative for Aesthetic™. Much 
of the film focuses on a rivalry between Edison 
and Tesla that more accurately existed between 
Edison and Westinghouse. There’s a lot of history 
tied to the late-19th-century war of the currents 
depicted in the film, including Westinghouse 
powering a world’s fair in Chicago, New York’s 
first electric chair execution and Tesla’s neurotic 

experiments in Colorado. But, all of this layered 
with artistic surrealism makes the whole thing 
difficult to follow. It grasps at so many threads of 
Tesla’s life, but fails to get anything 
meaningful across about the man 
himself.
The film acknowledges its 
lack of historical accuracy about 
Edison and Tesla’s relationship — 
Anne Morgan chimes in with a 
“it didn’t really happen like that” 
after the aforementioned ice 
cream fight — but it’s still overly 
misleading. Especially in what all 
my research indicates is a largely 
speculative construction of Tesla’s 
relationship with Anne Morgan and infatuation 
with French actress Sarah Bernhardt. The film 
does give a truthful depiction of Tesla’s insanity 
toward the end of his life...

ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

The 2019 Oscars: 
I’m not watching

This Sunday will be the first 
time I haven’t watched the 
Academy 
Awards 
ceremony 
live since I was a little kid. 
Growing up as a film lover and 
now pursuing film as my major, 
the Oscars have always been 
required reading in order to 
understand and partake in the 
discourse surrounding media 
this time of year. This weekend is 
also regionals for the Michigan 
Mock Trial team, of which I 
am a member. Consequently, 
I will be driving home from 
Northwestern University when 
the Oscars air. I’ll have to check 
Twitter or something to find out 
the results. The Oscars used to 
be like the Super Bowl for film 
majors; I assume for many they 
still are. But this year when I 
realized the Oscars were the 
same weekend as regionals, I 
barely shrugged my shoulders.
Much has been said about how 
out of touch the Oscars are with 
the general public, how uniform 
both the films and people 
nominated are and how much 
they fail to represent the growing 
diversity in the film industry and 
in the world at large. I agree with 
all of these criticisms and don’t 
believe I could add anything in 
these pages on that front that 
hasn’t been said by others in a 
better and more compelling way. 
But I will say that I don’t think 
the Oscars really provide much 
compelling 
drama 
anymore. 
That is to say, they’re super 
boring, both as an event and as 
a subject for discussion. The age 
of the “movie star” is more or 
less over. Are there any actors 
or actresses today who can 
guarantee a film will not flop 
simply because they are in it? 
I honestly do not think so. The 
rivalries and personalities that 
used to capture the attention of 
the nation just no longer interest 

me. Turns out a lot of the people 
promoting these things were 
ReallyBadPeopleTM.
Which movie should win 
Best Picture? What do I care? 
I haven’t liked a Best Picture 
winner in years. The best movie 
I saw was certainly Greta 
Gerwig’s “Little Women,” but 
I honestly haven’t seen many 
of the other nominees. There 
was much ado about “Joker” 
back in October, but the movie 
never interested me from the 
start and post-controversy it 
interested me even less. I liked 
“Parasite” a lot but still thought 
“Little Women” was something 
I’m more likely to revisit in the 
future. Either way, what does 
it matter what I, or anyone else 
really thinks? Did “The Shape 
of Water” win last year, or two 
years ago? I can hardly recall 
what happened in it. All the 
Oscars’prestige 
pictures 
 
— 
the World War psychological 
dramas and intimate character 
studies — have blended together. 
They’ve become as banal to me as 
the endless stream of superhero 
films that permeate cinemas. 
And no, I don’t think they should 
nominate 
more 
blockbusters 
just to get more people to watch. 
“Avengers: Endgame” is no more 
deserving of Best Picture than 
an Egg McMuffin is deserving of 
a best breakfast sandwich award. 
It’s good for what it is for sure — 
maybe the best version of what it 
can be — but it’s still covered in 
grease and you’re pretty sure it’s 
not good for you. 
For a while now people 
have been talking about how 
TV has begun to outdo film 
as 
the 
preeminent 
visual 
entertainment medium and it’s 
pretty hard to disagree with that 
when you look at the state of both 
industries. The Oscars sadly are 
another example of a problem 
that has become systemic.

A 24-step guide 
to breaking up

Each 
month, 
we 
invite 
Community Culture writers to 
respond to a themed prompt in a 
creative writing notebook. This 
month, February, is the month of 
love! But searching for valentines 
is SO last year… this month’s theme 
is breakups, bad dates and broken 
hearts. — Zoe Phillips, Senior Arts 
Editor

Realize. Something has shifted. 
Tectonic plates in your heart grind 
against each other ever so slowly 
until, one day, you notice a crack 
where there wasn’t one before. 
The landscape has shifted. 
Ignore the fuck out of it. The 
shift is almost imperceptible, 
so if you don’t focus too hard on 
it, perhaps it’s not there. It was 
probably just some stray hair 
caught in your glasses. God knows 
you never clean them enough. You 
stay quiet, you keep your eyes wide 
and unfocused. 
Realize again. Before it was 
a shift in tectonic plates, it was 
massive ancient rock sitting far 
below the crust of the earth. Now, 
it’s closer to the surface. Now, it’s 
a rumbling that’s rattling your 
teacups in their saucers, toppling 
over your cup of pencils and the 
papers on your desk, waking you 
from a sleep you weren’t even 
unconscious for anyway. You have 
to get up. 
Seek council. There is a 
moment of suspense before you 
hit the call button below your 
roommate’s contact info. Your 
finger lingers over the blue-green 
glow of your cell phone screen as 
you realize that words have far 
more power than they should. 
Once you confide in someone, 
you bring the problem into an 
unignorable existence. Abstract 
fears are now spun into audible 
words, braided with tears and 
“I don’t know’s.” You now have 

a witness. The landscape has 
changed. 
Avoid him. 
Become 
incredibly 

productive. 
Fling 
yourself 
towards distractions because the 
road ahead of you is thick with fog 
and it’s safer to stay with what you 
know. 
Realize again. Fog doesn’t 
clear without the scalding heat of 
the sun to cut through it. Neither 
will this. You have to do it. 
Plan it. Now this part makes 
you feel the dirtiest. You decide 
on a walk because that’s what they 
do in movies and you don’t want 
to ruin anywhere for him. You do 
it at night so there’s even less of a 
chance he’ll attach this memory to 
a specific spot. 
Oh God, there’s gonna be a 
memory.
Answer the door when he 
rings. 
Walk. 
Walk.
Chuckle half heartedly as he 
tells you a funny story from his 
day. 
Walk.
Stop walking. 
… 
...
It’s hard. Your words have 
blown away and faded back into 
abstract concepts and you’re just 
starting to formulate them again 
until you look up and—oh my god 
his eyes, he knows he knows, he’s 
known this whole walk (how long 
has he known and hurt for this, 
you don’t want to know) and his 
eyes are the last silent plea before 
you move into the world of words. 
He asks you to please, please stop 
what he knows is coming. 
You speak. 
He speaks. 
You leave. 
He stays.
You know his eyes are blue, but 
you’re already forgetting if they’re 
more blue or blue-green.
The landscape has shifted.

Plays with Pearson: Breaking down Lockwood’s winner against Ohio State

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
sat 
down with Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson on Thursday and pulled 
out a hockey whiteboard.
Pearson 
drew 
up 
the 
intricacies of a play from last 
weekend’s 
matchup 
against 
then-No. 11 Ohio State that 
led to a Will Lockwood goal. 
He broke down 
where 
players 
went with the 
puck, what they 
were 
thinking 
with 
the 
play 
they made and 
how it all went 
down — with the 
X’s and O’s on a 
whiteboard.
The 
Daily 
deciphered 
the 
board 
and 
pieced 
together 
a 
series 
of 
drawings 
that 
represent what Pearson had to 
show.
Here’s what he drew up.
***
Friday, the Buckeyes tied the 
game with a power play goal 
midway through the second 
period. Momentum flipped then 
and Ohio State started pressing 
heavily against a stout Michigan 
defense. With four minutes left 
in the game, Lockwood took the 
puck off a rebound and scored 
a thrilling game-winning goal. 
The Wolverines went on to 
win the game, 3-2, due to the 
hustling efforts of Lockwood.
The Michigan Daily: Can 
you break down (senior forward 
Will Lockwood)’s game winner 
Friday?
Mel Pearson: Yes, Slaker 
shot it, so Will came in and 
came across like this. Slaker 
came in from behind him so he 
dropped the puck, and Slaker 
came in and basically took the 
shot.
Pearson: Will continued on 
this way, and the rebound came 
out to him. He took the one shot 
and followed it in. Puck came 

here, he actually took a second 
shot, and it came here. 
Pearson: So Will’s coming 
here, and he comes in and cuts 
across. This is his sort of path 
that he took, and yes Slaker just 
came in here and took the shot. 
And then actually (Slaker) goes 
to the net, but Will stayed with 
the puck. 
Pearson: That’s the biggest 
thing. 
After 
the 
shot 
was 
taken, he got the 
rebound. 
You 
teach guys to go 
to the net, and 
then the second 
one came to him. 
He’s 
fortunate 
it 
came 
here 
and then he’s so 
quick. He’s got 
such good speed 
and quick hands. 
When the goalie 
made the save, he was here, and 
Will just beat him back to the 
post.
Pearson: 
They 
had 
a 
defenseman 
here 
but 
the 
defenseman for some reason 
— this is how Ohio State and 
other teams play. They sort of 
hold in front. (The opposing 
player) didn’t go down to meet 
him here, and that gave Will 
actually, Will’s probably a few 
feet behind the goal line when 
he stuffed the puck in. So, this 
defenseman was taught not to 
go back down and get him, just 
sort of hold the post like this.
Pearson: Slaker’s coming in 
like this. Oh, yeah. Again, Will 
just comes in like this. He leaves 
the puck for Slaker coming 
down here. Slaker takes the 
wide shot, gets a rebound. It’s 
actually a good shot. Will, one 
rebound, continues on, second 
rebound, and then picks it up 
and jam it here. Then Slaker 
goes to the net here. Will’s so 
quick like I said, he just put in. 
TMD: Could he have made 
the open pass to Slaker at the 
net?
Pearson: He could have, but 
I think you sometimes make a 

decision, you don’t even look. 
Especially when he first got out 
here, I think his whole intention 
was to beat the goalie to the far 
post. A lot of 
times you can 
when that goalie 
has come out to 
play 
this 
shot 
and 
it 
comes 
right back, he’s 
so 
quick. 
If 
you’re fast like 
Will and quick, 
you 
can 
get 
around to that 
far post before 
the goalie can physically move 
there. That’s what happened on 
that play. And good goal scorers 
do that. You know, you see some 

guys get in there, come way 
out here like this and look for 
the pass. They don’t have the 
aggressive move to the net and 
Will 
has 
that, 
he likes to go 
to the net. He’s 
aggressive 
and 
he was rewarded 
for that on that 
play.
TMD: 
You 
talked 
about 
positioning 
of 
that defenseman, 
do you teach that 
differently?
Pearson: We do. We do so we 
would, a lot of times, if there’s 
a defenseman over here with 
Will, we tell them to go with 

him. The other guy holds. Some 
teams will actually go with 
them, and then when they get 
to a certain point, if they don’t 
have 
contact, 
they just let him 
go. 
This 
guy 
will try and pick 
him up. But the 
Buckeyes 
don’t 
normally do that, 
they’re just sort 
of playing off the 
post. Will didn’t 
come 
out 
far 
enough for this 
guy to challenge 
him, so his feet are behind the 
goal, his (stick) tip just wraps it 
around. But we teach a different 
(style). We’ll tell this guy to go 

after him and this guy just hold 
him for them. Look for anybody 
here. Sometimes like I said, if 
this guy’s too far ahead of him, 
then he’ll switch 
off, 
he’ll 
just 
come to the front 
of the net and let 
this D go. But 
you never want 
to leave this area 
here. You never 
want 
to 
leave 
that area. That’s 
a 
dangerous 
scoring position. 
Ohio State did 
that. They didn’t leave that 
area. Will just happened to 
be so quick that he beat him 
around the net.

MSU rivalry changing under Howard 

The Big Ten’s best rivalry 
returns on Saturday.
Over the previous decade, 
no two teams have flexed more 
dominance over the conference 
than Michigan and Michigan 
State. 
No 
team 
is 
more 
emphatically circled on the 
schedule for the Wolverines. 
No regular season game carries 
more meaning. No holds are 
barred.
Heading 
into 
the 
first 
iteration of this showdown on 
Jan. 5, there were a thousand 
question marks regarding the 
arrival of new coach Juwan 
Howard.
What was the rivalry going to 
look like under new leadership? 
How was Howard going to 
embrace the moment? Would 
he 
maintain 
composure 
or 
succumb to the grandness of 
the moment and the narrative 
written 
by 
two 
juggernaut 
programs up to that point?
In that early-January game, 
Howard answered many of 
the lingering questions … by 
receiving his first technical foul 
of the season.
After the referees missed 
a potential foul call on senior 
center Austin Davis following 
a drive to the hoop, Howard 
was livid at the lack of response 
from the officials. He stepped 

on the court, and the ref made 
a “T” with his hands, signaling 
a marked departure from the 
days of rivalry past.
In the previous Michigan era, 
former coach John Beilein was 
a resolute, composed figure on 
the sideline. The epitome of his 
program’s values.
On the other end of the 
sideline, 
Michigan 
State 
employed a more emotional 
firebrand to run its ship. Tom 
Izzo — the famed high-level 
game manager — argued and 
screamed 
at 
every 
available 
opportunity. In 
their demeanor, 
the two couldn’t 
be 
more 
different.
But Howard’s 
temperament 
on the sidelines 
is 
a 
marked 
departure from 
his predecessor.
“If there’s one thing I’m glad 
about Juwan, to be very blunt 
and honest with you, is John 
was so buttoned up that I look 
like a fool all the time,” Izzo said 
after his program’s win against 
the Wolverines. “And now both 
of us look like fools, it makes it 
an equal opportunity deal.”
Added Howard: “I’m going 
to back up my team for all 40 
minutes of the ball game. That 
possession, I had seen enough. 
I saw a lot of contact. … But 

unfortunately it wasn’t called, 
so I got a little beside myself. 
I’m an emotional guy, and I’m 
going to always fight for my 
players.’
Howard provided a glimpse 
— however small — into the new 
era of the rivalry. The technical, 
along with the new direction 
Howard is taking Michigan 
men’s basketball, are laying 
the foundation for a new, epic 
chapter in the showdown.
Playing with a newfound 
passion and emotion on the 
sidelines 
is 
one thing, but 
picking 
the 
players to help 
you write the 
narrative 
is 
arguably 
the 
more important 
element.
Under 
Beilein, 
the 
Spartans 
held the clear 
recruiting advantage year in 
and year out. When one top-
10 recruiting class fled to the 
NBA or graduated, another 
one quickly took its place. 
Beilein famously only sought 
the players that fit his system, 
often leading to less-than-elite 
groups of athletes.
But his ability to make more 
with less made the rivalry that 
much more exciting.
With 
Howard 
quickly 
amassing one of the Wolverines’ 
most highly-ranked recruiting 
classes in the last two decades, 
things are going to look a lot 
different when Michigan and 
Michigan State suit up in the 
future.
Poised and methodical versus 
athletic and emotional. It’s an 
oversimplification, sure, but an 
apt characterization of the two 
eras in Michigan basketball is 
beginning to form. And through 
the transition of these eras — 
one man and one program is 
here to stay.
“Juwan’s done a good job, 
done a great job there,” Izzo 
said after his first win against 
Howard. “So he will do a 
good job, but we’re not going 
anywhere. We’re not going 
anywhere.”

‘M’ hopes to find identity early

Carol 
Hutchins 
leaned 
forward in her seat, pausing 
before answering a question 
posed by one of the reporters 
clustered around her. The 
room’s attention rested on 
Michigan’s softball coach. Yet 
the words that hung on the wall 
behind her, displayed in white 
lettering 
and 
accentuated 
by a faded blue background, 
became hard to ignore.
The Team, The Team, The 
Team. 
Bo Schembechler’s famed 
phrase has grown synonymous 
with all facets of Michigan 
athletics, 
softball 
included. 
For Hutchins, it’s a rallying cry 
that merits echoing. 
Hutchins believes her team 
has the individual talent to be 
a top-16 seed come May. But 
reaching such a point requires 
more than individual success. 
With the 2020 season finally 
here, Hutchins is about to find 
out how quickly the group 
learns how to play together. 
“I like our group a lot,” 
Hutchins said. “And now we 
gotta learn how to go into battle 
together. And everybody needs 
to contribute. Contributions, 
some of them are pitching, 
some of them are getting 
key hits in big situations and 
sometimes it’s just as simple 
as being the one in the dugout 
who helps keep everybody up.”
The softball season, in a 
sense, is a battle. It’s grueling. 
It’s lengthy. And it requires 
more than pure talent to 
succeed. A team has to have 
a collective will to win and 
its hearts invested, a mantra 
Hutchins has attempted to 
instill within her players. 
“We’re trying to get our kids 
to understand that we need to 
be risk takers, and just go for 
things and not to be tentative,” 
Hutchins said. “We practice 
more 
aggressive 
things, 
aggressive style baserunning 
and we’re gonna have to be 
that team that just gets out 
there and gets after it. We have 
to figure out a way to do it all 

together, be together. That’s 
gonna be us.”
This playing style will be 
first put to the test on Friday, 
when the Wolverines kick 
off their five game season-
opening weekend in Tampa Bay 
at the USF-Wilson Demarini 
Tournament. 
Friday’s 
slate 
provides an opportunity for 
Michigan to shake off some 
expected 
rust 
— 
Georgia 
State and Illinois State, its 
two opponents, finished with 
a combined record of 26-79 a 
year ago.
For 
the 
Wolverines, 
shaking off the 
rust quickly is 
key to avoiding 
a repeat of the 
doldrums 
of 
last February, 
when 
a 
flat 
start 
dipped 
the 
program 
to a low point 
not 
seen 
since 
2001, 
the 
team leaving its first two 
tournaments under .500. 
The rest of the weekend 
schedule provides an uptick in 
competition. A game against 
No. 7 Florida, a perennial 
softball powerhouse coming 
off a College World Series 
appearance, looms on Saturday. 
While the Gators lost their top 
pitcher, Kelly Barnhil, and 
hitter, Amanda Lorenz, in the 
offseason, they still pose a 
formidable challenge.
So does host South Florida, 
a team that made it to the 
Tallahassee Regional in the 
NCAA Tournament a year ago. 

An early Sunday face-off with 
Fresno State, a middle-of-
the-pack group that returns a 
steady nucleus of players, caps 
off the weekend. 
“It’s going to be a learning 
curve,” 
Hutchins 
said 
of 
the 
early-season 
gameplay. 
“And I don’t know how this 
year’s gonna go, but I know 
one thing. As we evolve, as a 
coaching staff, we’re gonna 
assess every week what we can 
do to help (the players) achieve 
their goals.”
As 
for 
the 
players, at last 
Tuesday’s media 
day, they wore 
faces tired of the 
offseason 
and 
itching to return 
to 
competitive 
softball. 
Internally, 
it 
seems as if the 
page has long 
been 
flipped 
from 2019 to 2020. Now, with 
the season on the doorstep, 
this year’s book can finally 
begin to be written. 
What 
identity 
will 
this 
year’s Michigan team write? 
Is it a cohesive, aggressive unit 
like Hutchins envisions, one 
that embodies Schembechler’s 
words? Or is it something 
different, requiring perhaps 
a steeper learning curve than 
anticipated? 
The five-game slate this 
weekend 
won’t 
provide 
a 
definite answer — Hutchins 
admitted that could take until 
next month. But it will reveal 
at least a glimpse of clarity.

He leaves the 
pick for Slaker 
coming down 
here.

Will has that, 
he likes to go 
to the net. He’s 
aggressive.

Will (was) 
so quick that 
he beat him

MICHIGAN ESCAPES PURDUE, 66-63, TO 
CLIMB ABOVE .500 IN BIG TEN PLAY

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

THAT’LL
PUR-DO IT

Design by Jack Silberman

Nolan’s defense stands out in start

Maddie Nolan stood on the 
court, lined up just outside the 
center circle. For the first time 
in the freshman’s career, she 
waited for the tip-off from the 
floor.
Her first start wasn’t an 
expected, 
predetermined 
ordeal — she was told earlier 
Thursday.
On Wednesday, sophomore 
guard Danielle Rauch injured 
her hand in practice, two weeks 
after the starting position fell 
in her lap when senior Kayla 
Robbins tore her ACL. 
With 
just 
seven 
players 
available 
against 
the 
team 
right above it in the standings, 
Michigan — with the help of 
Nolan — held its own Thursday 
on the way to a 66-63 victory 
over Purdue.
Nolan started the year on 
the bench, seeing minutes late 
in games when the margin 
of victory for the Wolverines 
was insurmountable. Against 
lesser opponents, she wasn’t 
flashy. Nolan made the plays 
she needed to and did what she 
was told. In close games, she 
didn’t play.
“Nolan had a tremendous 
high school career and then 
she 
suffered 
a 
significant 
injury, and coming back from 
that injury she wasn’t even 
sure what she was going to be 
able to do,” Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said. “When 
she got to Michigan this fall, 
we weren’t sure what her 

basketball career was going to 
look like, and she’s really done 
a tremendous job.”
But as the season progressed, 
her work ethic in practice 
earned her more and more 
minutes. In the last couple of 
games, Nolan has been one of 
the first players off the bench.
Then, 
on 
Thursday, 
she 
played 28 minutes.
Locking down the defensive 
end, Nolan refused to let the 

Boilermakers get hot, even as 
they targeted her. Just over a 
minute in the game, she chased 
down a shooter at the 3-point 
line and smacked away the ball.
A 
couple 
minutes 
later, 
Purdue 
looked 
to 
score 
a 
quick bucket after a defensive 
rebound 
left 
most 
of 
the 
Wolverines behind the play. 
Senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
and Nolan stood alone against 
two Boilermakers and, upon 
Johnson’s 
direction, 
Nolan 
took on the driving Karissa 
McLaughlin. 
The 
normally 
easy layup barely made it above 
McLaughlin’s head before it 
was swatted away.

These two early plays set 
the tone for the 5-foot-9 Nolan, 
who finished the game with a 
team high of four blocks. She 
even rejected a shot from the 
6-foot-4 Fatou Diagne.
“In 
high 
school, 
you 
obviously play against a lot of 
smaller kids so I could block 
some of them, but not here,” 
Nolan said. “I don’t think I’ve 
had four blocks in the whole of 
practice. … I think I just knew 
I needed to get defensive stops 
and that was my mindset.”
Nolan also pulled her weight 
on the glass, striking like a 
snake when the ball fell from 
the rims. Whether she was at 
the 3-point arc defending the 
shot, or bodying up a player on 
the post, she found the ball.
“We need five people to 
crash the defensive boards, 
we need people to crash the 
offensive boards,” Nolan said. 
“I know I’m not necessarily the 
biggest scorer, but I’m trying 
to help the team in other ways, 
like rebounding was what I 
came in focused on.”
Nolan ended the game with 
two points, six rebounds and 
four blocks. She wasn’t flashy 
and didn’t make much of an 
offensive impact. But she found 
ways to contribute when a team 
suffering from injuries needed 
her.
As the clock ticked down, 
and Purdue worked its way into 
the game, Barnes Arico trusted 
Nolan. Her fight and her grit 
were exactly what Michigan 
needed to find a way out of the 
game with a win.

‘M’ survives after nearly blowing lead

Seventeen 
seconds. 
Michigan’s ahead by three. 
Purdue has the ball and one 
last chance to force overtime. 
Eight 
seconds. 
Boilermakers’ 
guard 
Dominique Oden catches a 
pass and drives along the 
baseline. 
Three seconds. Oden pops 
up and turns to the wing, 
looking to pass it out. 
A 
whistle. 
The 
referee 
points to the baseline. Oden 
stepped out of bounds. It 
looks like the Wolverines (15-7 
overall, 6-5 Big Ten) have 
escaped with the win. 
But it wasn’t over yet. The 
inbound pass went through 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon’s legs and out of 
bounds. After a review, the 
refs determined that Hillmon 
had never touched the ball. 
The Boilermakers (15-9, 6-6) 
had one last shot at it. 
After 
the 
inbound, 
the 
Purdue player heaved up a 
three-quarter-court shot. It 
fell short. Michigan survived, 
66-63. 
Even 
before 
Thursday’s 
game started, Michigan knew 
it wouldn’t be an easy night. 
Sophomore 
guard 
Danielle 
Rauch — who had been filling 
in for injured senior forward 
Kayla Robbins — was out with 
a hand injury. This meant 
freshman 
guard 
Maddie 
Nolan, who averaged just 8.8 
minutes per game entering 

Thursday’s contest, would be 
making her first career start. 
Though 
Nolan 
didn’t 
contribute 
much 
on 
the 
offensive end, she did help her 
team on the glass, securing six 
rebounds on the night. She also 
added a surprising four blocks, 
two of which came in the first 
six minutes. 
“I just try to take care of the 
ball, just bring energy to the 
floor,” Nolan said. “Obviously, 
you guys have seen (Rauch) 
just does a great job of getting 
everyone hyped. She brings the 
team together. She celebrates 
everyone no matter what, so I 
just tried to imitate that.”
Offensively, the Wolverines 
hit their stride early. With the 
Boilermakers crashing the paint 
to defend sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon, the 3-point shot 
was open for junior forward 
Hailey Brown, who went 3-of-
4 from deep in the first half. 
Senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
followed suit, sinking a pair of 
threes en route to a 12-point 
first half. 
“Everybody 
that 
watches 
film on us — everyone in the 
country — knows that we rely 
on paint touches,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said. 
“ ... (But) when you can have 
people knock down the outside 
shot, it gives Naz at least a little 
bit more space to be successful.”
That 
high-low 
attack 
unleashed Hillmon, who, after 
being held to just eight points 
in the first half, doubled that 
output in a third quarter where 
her teammates struggled to 

hit shots. With the defense 
focusing on closing out on 
threes, she had just enough 
breathing room to carry the 
Wolverines into the fourth 
quarter with a six-point lead.
The separation turned out 
to be crucial, as Michigan’s 
shooting went cold in the 
fourth. 
Going 
nearly 
five 
minutes without a field goal, 
the Wolverines saw their lead 
— which had been as high as 
14 — dwindle down to one 
point with under four minutes 
remaining. 
Barnes 
Arico 
called timeout and drew up a 
play to free up Brown on the 
perimeter. Brown drained the 
three. 
“I thought the shots (Brown) 
made in the first half were 
incredible,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I thought she was open a lot 
more than we found her in the 
first half because I thought her 
girl was doubling on Naz, and 
we knew late that her girl was 
doubling on Naz, so we wanted 
to put her in some screening 
action, and if we didn’t have 
Naz we were gonna have her 
wide open coming off of a 
down screen.”
That shot — along with a 
layup from Hillmon in the final 
minute — ultimately sealed the 
win. The game was ugly, and if 
Rauch’s injury turns out to be 
long term, life won’t get any 
easier for Michigan moving 
forward. 
But 
considering 
the 
circumstances entering today, 
the team will take a win 
however it can.
