Officials have yet to 
provide requested 
records from federal 
Title IX investigation

By SAM GRINGLAS and 

MAX RADWIN

Managing News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

The University has yet to release 

dozens of documents related to 
the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion’s ongoing Title IX investiga-
tion of the University, which were 
requested and paid for in part 
by The Michigan Daily over two 
months ago.

The Daily made a request to the 

University in December under the 
purview of the state’s Freedom of 
Information Act, and paid one of 
two $445 fees in January for the 
collection of documents related 
to sexual misconduct — including 
written complaints, e-mails from 
administrators and witness state-
ments, among other documents.

The state’s Freedom of Informa-

tion Act, or FOIA, provides for the 
release of records by public insti-
tutions in the state of Michigan, 

including the University. However, 
after the documents are requested, 
FOIA does not specify a deadline 
by which an institution must pro-
duce the documents.

In a February phone interview 

with the Daily, Patricia Sellinger, 
the University’s FOIA coordinator, 
said she could not provide a time-
line for when the Daily’s document 
request would be filled.

She could not be reached for 

comment Wednesday.

Frank 
LoMonte, 
executive 

director of the Student Press Law 
Center, said he believes the Univer-
sity has surpassed what he consid-
ers a “reasonable time.”

“Because of the national spot-

light that has been focused on 
campus sexual assault, colleges 
everywhere are being asked for 
documents about how they handle 
those cases,” he said. “Understand-
ably, there is sensitivity about 
records that might reveal confiden-
tial information about victims and 
some degree of redacting is prob-
ably legitimate. But that process 
really should not take months.”

Though the FOIA does not 

specify a time frame for producing 
records, Jane Briggs-Bunting, an 
attorney, president of the Michigan 

E. Royster Harper 
facilitates dialogue 
on inclusion, U. of 
Oklahoma incident

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, sat 
down with a group of students 
Wednesday evening from all 
parts of campus to discuss 
diversity and the role adminis-

trators can play in facilitating it.

According to Jackie Simpson, 

director of the Trotter Multicul-
tural Center, the conversation, 
titled “Keepin’ It Real with VP 
Harper,” is part of a new effort 
by the Trotter Center and the 
Office of Multi-Ethnic Affairs 
to engage students and adminis-
trators personally. The initiative 
is meant to facilitate the discus-
sion of and to combat issues of 
equity and inclusion on campus.

The group discussed a vari-

ety of topics related to issues 
of diversity on campus, includ-
ing methods for fostering a 

welcoming 
campus 
climate, 

the drawbacks of the race and 
ethnicity requirement and the 
recent racial controversy at the 
University of Oklahoma.

Royster said promoting an 

accepting campus climate is an 
important factor in preventing 
issues related to discrimination. 
However, she said that because 
“campus climate” is a nebulous 
word, it can be hard to measure.

“How do you measure this 

feeling that’s almost like air,” 
Harper said. “It’s there, but it’s 
hard to describe and you know 
when it isn’t there. That’s one of 

the challenges around climate.”

She added that a welcom-

ing campus climate can include 
using pipeline programs, where 
universities begin recruiting 
in high school, to encourage 
lower-income and minority stu-
dents to attend the University.

Harper also noted that it is 

difficult to teach about racial 
differences and micro-aggres-
sions in the first place, as many 
times people become desensi-
tized to these conflicts.

we respond in light of the way 

Report alleges lack 
of due process in 

Office of Institutional 
Equity procedures

By SHOHAM GEVA and 

CARLY NOAH

Daily News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

In a report sent to media 

Wednesday, the Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs 
said the body sees several major 
flaws with how the University’s 
Office for Institutional Equity 
treats faculty members who are 
subjects of harassment and dis-
crimination investigations.

The report’s central concerns 

are the adequacy of due process 
protections in OIE procedures, 
and OIE’s application of those 
procedures in the cases of three 
faculty members who submit-
ted complaints to SACUA. OIE is 
tasked in part with investigating 

and resolving instances of discrim-
ination and discriminatory harass-
ment at the University.

“The evidence available to us, 

examined in the course of review-
ing OIE’s practices, raises serious 
doubts about the validity of the OIE 
findings in these cases,” the report 
read. “SACUA does not take a posi-
tion on the outcome of these cases. 
But our findings regarding lack of 
due process necessitate reconsid-
eration of these cases.”

In regards to the identified 

issues with due process, Wednes-
day’s report recommended that 
OIE consult with SACUA to incor-
porate “fair and adequate notice, 
fair investigation processes and the 
ability to obtain an independent, 
meaningful and timely appeal of 
findings,” into its operations. The 
recommendation 
mirrored 
one 

provided in an April report to Uni-
versity Provost Martha Pollack.

SACUA, the executive commit-

tee of the body that formally rep-
resents faculty, first began looking 
into OIE’s policies in 2012 when

Discussion 

examines loss 
of stability with 
closing schools

By COLLEEN HARRISON

Daily Staff Reporter

The future of education in 

Detroit was the focus of con-
versation Wednesday at the 
Ford School of Public Policy.

Part of the Education Pol-

icy Initiative speaker series, 
the panel consisted of active 
members of the Detroit com-
munity who spoke about 
education 
issues. 
It 
was 

co-sponsored by the Public 
Policy School and the School 
of Education. Across the 
board, each speaker stressed 
the dysfunction of the city’s 
school system.

One of the four speakers, 

Bridge 
Magazine 
report-

er Chastity Pratt Dawsey, 
focused largely on the finan-
cial issues plaguing education 

in the city. Dawsey noted that 
schools in Detroit often close 
due to eliminated funding 
and children often have to 
switch from school to school.

Dawsey said when students 

lose their school, they lose the 
resources and connections 
they have built there. She 
explained that students gain 
important stability from the 
support systems they develop 
while in one school.

earlier that morning, which he 
called a Student Aid Bill of Rights, 
that will direct the U.S. Depart-

Bill could increase campus sexual assault regulations

Michigan senator 
co-sponsors federal 
effort to levy stricter 
penalties on colleges

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

Last month, Sen. Gary Peters 

(D–Mich.), as part of a biparti-
san group of 10 other senators, 
introduced a new piece of leg-
islation that aims to strengthen 
efforts to prevent sexual assault 
on college campuses.

Sen. 
Peters 
joined 
Sena-

tors Claire McCaskill (D–Mo.), 
Dean Heller (R–Nev.), Richard 
Blumenthal (D–Conn.), Chuck 
Grassley (R–Iowa), Kirsten Gil-
librand (D–N.Y.), Kelly Ayotte 
(R–N.H.), Mark Warner (D–Va.), 
Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) and Shel-
ley Moore Capito (R–W.V.) in co-
sponsoring the Campus Safety 
and Accountability Act, which 
was introduced in the Senate on 
Feb. 26.

The current bill is a strength-

ened version of a Campus Safety 
and Accountability Act bill ini-
tially proposed last summer.

In a press release, Peters 

said the act aims to create real 
accountability for sexual assault 
crimes, and demand transpar-
ency from colleges and universi-
ties regarding the incidents that 
occur.

“As the father of two teen-

age daughters, I’m proud to join 
with my colleagues on a bipar-
tisan basis to tackle the serious 
problem of sexual assault on 
college campuses,” Peters said. 
“This bill is a major step towards 
creating an environment where 
all students can feel safe and 
secure while receiving a higher 
education by bringing more 
accountability and transparen-
cy to reporting sexual assault on 
campuses.”

Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, 

director of the University’s 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, said because 
the proposed legislation is in 
its early stages in the Senate, 

it’s still too early to determine 
whether University policies will 
comply with those outlined in 
the act or what impact it will 
have on campus.

However, she did point out 

that the bill is largely silent on 
the subject of prevention efforts, 
especially about the training of 
college stu-
dents, 
an 

area SAPAC 
has focused 
on.

“The 
bill 

has more of 
a focus on 
compliance 
matters and 
relation-
ships to law 
enforce-
ment, 
and 

other kinds 
of reporting 
responsibili-
ties,” Rider-
Milkovich 
said. “As it 
relates to the 
training of students, that is a 
place where the bill is less likely 
to impact SAPAC’s work.”

She noted that previously 

passed legislation, specifically 
the 2013 amendments to the 
Clery Act, provides guidance for 
universities in terms of staff and 
student training.

In contrast, the new bill is 

mainly focused on professional-
izing the response to and report-
ing of sexual assaults that occur 
on campuses, as well as protect-
ing the rights of the accused, 
modifying financial penalties 
and removing barriers for stu-
dents reporting assault.

In an e-mail interview, LSA 

senior 
Hannah 
Crisler, 
the 

campaign director for I Will, 
a student-led initiative to spur 
campus-wide 
conversation 

about sexual assault, highlight-
ed the bill’s efforts to provide 
resources and heighten aware-
ness for accused students.

“If the accused are continu-

ally attacked and blamed and 
left without education, without 
advising, and without an under-
standing of how their act was 

deemed wrong then they will 
never learn,” she wrote.

Under the act, universities 

would be required to standard-
ize their approach to student 
disciplinary 
hearings 
across 

campus. Athletic departments 
and other subgroups would be 
prohibited from handling com-

plaints 
inde-

pendently. 
Furthermore, 
the act man-
dates 
that 

schools notify 
both the vic-
tim 
and 
the 

accused with-
in 24 hours of 
any 
decision 

regarding the 
advancement 
of a disciplin-
ary 
measure. 

Such commu-
nication must 
inform 
both 

parties of the 
rights and due 
process 
pro-

tections they are entitled to.

In response to those parts of 

the legislation, Rider-Milkovich 
said she thought the University 
already uses fair policies in dis-
ciplinary hearings.

She also noted that the 

University’s 
Student 
Sexual 

Misconduct Policy applies uni-
formly to all students, irrespec-
tive of their status, affiliation or 
the school or college they belong 
to.

The 
legislation 
will 
also 

introduce enforceable Title IX 
penalties and stiffer penalties 
for Clery Act violations.

Institutions 
that 
do 
not 

comply with certain require-
ments of the Campus Safety and 
Accountability Act, Title IX and 
the Clery Act would be subject 
to penalties as high as 1 percent 
of their operating budget.

“Previously, the only allow-

able penalty was the loss of all 
federal student aid which is not 
practical and has never been 
done,” Peters said in a release.

The funds gathered by the 

U.S. Department of Education 

from these higher penalties 
would go to a new grant pro-
gram that would fund schools’ 
research for better methods of 
sexual assault prevention and 
crime response on their cam-
puses.

Rider-Milkovich 
applauded 

the inclusion of the fund, and 
said universities, researchers 
and legislators have not invest-
ed enough attention in address-
ing gaps in knowledge on these 
issues.

“Seeking to reinvest any fines 

into research on best practices 
was very encouraging, and I am 
grateful that Senator McCaskill 
heard so many of us from the 
field who were asking for that,” 
she said.

However, in regards to anoth-

er section of the bill focused on 
professionalizing 
responses, 

which would require minimum 
training standards for on-cam-
pus personnel and the appoint-
ment of “confidential advisors” 
to provide guidance for survi-
vors, Rider-Milkovich said she 
had some concerns.

Currently, she said, the act 

specifies that confidential advis-
ers cannot be undergraduate or 
graduate students, which could 
run contrary to a SAPAC gradu-
ate student internship program 
that trains students to engage 
with sexual assault prevention.

“I have concerns that this 

legislation 
might 
undermine 

or eliminate this professional 
training program at SAPAC and 
at other campuses across the 
country,” she said. “So even as 
the legislation requires there to 
be professional staff advocates, 
we need to have the ability to 
train those advocates to do the 
kind of work that’s required on 
campuses.”

The act also intends to sur-

vey students at every college 
and university in the country to 
assess sexual violence on college 
campuses. The results of these 
studies, which will be conduct-
ed biannually, will be released to 
inform prospective students.

Late last year, the University 

announced it would conduct its 
own survey on campus climate 

surrounding sexual assault.

Also, under the bill, schools 

will no longer be allowed to 
penalize students who violated 
other parts of student conduct 
code in nonviolent manner dur-
ing an incident. For example, 
students who, in reporting sex-
ual violence, admit to underage 
drinking cannot be prosecuted 
for that action.

Crisler said she thought that 

would be one of the more benefi-
cial parts of the bill.

“This addition to sexual vio-

lence policy is beneficial because 
students may feel more comfort-
able reporting an incident that 
included 
underage 
drinking, 

where as before they could have 
been scared of being reprimand-
ed,” she said. “Without that pen-
alty it also reinforces that sexual 
assault happens with or with-
out alcohol, and that survivors 
should not be punished.”

The act would also require 

institutions 
to 
enter 
into 

“memoranda 
of 
understand-

ing” between local and cam-
pus enforcement agencies that 
report to campus, meaning that 
the two will collaborate, sharing 
jurisdiction. This eliminates any 
time wasted debating jurisdic-
tion between the enforcement 
agencies.

Rider-Milkovich said agree-

ments with the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, the Washt-
enaw County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment and Pittsfield Township 
already exist.

Overall, both Rider-Milkov-

ich and Crisler said they think 
this legislation has a lot of 
potential.

“I was very pleased to see 

that the bill was created by 
a bipartisan group — it is so 
important that both Repub-
licans and Democrats could 
gather and create something 
as a team,” Crisler said. “The 
Campus Sexual Assault and 
Accountability Act has a lot 
of hope, and is going to be a 
large step in the right direction 
towards providing safety, edu-
cation, resources and hopefully 
prevention of sexual assault on 
college campuses.”

“
“

“As the father of 

two teenage daugh-

ters, I’m proud to join 

with my colleagues 

on a bipartisan basis 

to tackle the serious 

problem of sexual 

assault on college

cerns to the director of Aca-
demic Human Resources and 
the director of OIE in Novem-
ber 2013, according to the 
report. They also included 
their concerns in an April 
report to Pollack.

Shortly after that report was 

filed, SACUA received a formal 
complaint from a faculty mem-
ber who had been the subject of 
an OIE investigation. Because 
SACUA considers faculty mem-
bers as under its jurisdiction, the 
group asked the Faculty Hear-
ing Committee to investigate 
and report on the complaint’s 
allegations. Two subsequent 
faculty complaints about OIE 
policies were also filed to the 
FHC on August 4, 2014, and Sep-
tember 8, 2014, respectively.

More broadly, Wednesday’s 

report recommended that all 
OIE decisions and actions be 
subject to immediate review 
under the current faculty griev-
ance procedures until new 
ones are adopted. It also rec-
ommended that all OIE inves-
tigations that would result 
specifically in the termination, 
dismissal or demotion of a fac-
ulty member should be con-
ducted under the auspices of 
Regents Bylaw 5.09, which gov-
erns how faculty are dismissed, 
demoted and terminated.

Additionally, in regards to 

the three faculty members 
who submitted complaints to 
SACUA about OIE proceed-
ings, the report recommend-
ed that the verdicts in their 
cases be reversed until they 
could be “reconsidered in a 
forum with appropriate due 
process protections.”

The report cited minutes 

from an August 26, 2013 SACUA 
meeting where the chair read 
several responses from OIE to 
questions from SACUA, includ-
ing a response that held that OIE 
proceedings against faculty are 
not subject to standard griev-
ance proceedings, protocals for 
challenging a University action.

According to SACUA’s web-

site, any University faculty 
member can file a complaint to 
SACUA within 90 days of the 
date the grievance first took 
place. The parties at which the 
faculty complaint is directed 
are responsible for making a 
decision at the departmental 
level. If the grievance cannot 
be resolved at the departmen-
tal level, it is brought in front of 
the Grievance Hearing Board. 
The GHB is only to be attend-
ed by the grieving parties and 
their advisers, who can be 
attorneys. Witnesses are only 
to be present at the GHB when 
they are testifying.

In an e-mail interview, SACUA 

Chair Scott Masten, a professor 
of business economics and public 
policy, wrote that the next step for 
SACUA is to present the report to 
the Senate Assembly Committee 
where representatives from the 
University’s departments will 
have an opportunity to comment 
on the proposal.

“Beyond that, we expect 

to work with the University 
administration 
to 
explore 

ways to improve OIE pro-
cedures to address our due 
process concerns, including 
the establishment of a cred-
ible appeal process,” Masten 
wrote. “All of this, of course, 
will be done with recognition 
of the University’s commit-
ment to maintaining a work 
environment free of discrimi-
nation and harassment.”

Masten added that for most 

faculty members, the report 
will have little effect because 
the majority of University fac-
ulty will not be accused of the 
types of behavior OIE is respon-
sible for investigating.

“But for those who do, the 

addition of basic due process 
protections — of the type that 
students are already guaranteed 
— should help to assure that out-
comes are fairer and less prone 
to error,” Masten wrote.

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald wrote in a state-
ment that the University plans 
to review the recommendations 
detailed in the report.

“We stand behind the pro-

fessionalism of the staff in 
Academic Human Resources 
and the Office for Institutional 
Equity,” he wrote. “We also 
note that the SACUA report 
has some good suggestions 
about enhancements to our 
processes that we are look-
ing into implementing, and we 
will carefully consider what 
SACUA has provided.”

Coalition for Open Government 
and former director of Michi-
gan State University’s School 
of Journalism, said many pub-
lic institutions interpret the 
response period as applicable 
to the production of the docu-
ments as well.

“U of M has obviously not 

interpreted it that way,” she said.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the Daily has 
requested very sensitive docu-
ments, and University officials 
need to ensure the release doesn’t 
violate the Family Education 
Rights and Privacy Act, for exam-
ple. He said two months is not an 
unreasonable time frame for the 
University to respond to such a 
request.

Certain types of information 

are exempt from FOIA, and offi-
cials must review every document 
to redact information not permit-
ted for release. He also said docu-
ments wouldn’t likely be released 
as they become available — per 
the Daily’s request — but they 
would most likely be produced as 
a full package.

“It’s far more important to do 

this right than to do this quickly,” 
he said.

Fitzgerald also said he couldn’t 

speculate on the length of the pro-
cess, but said the review has start-
ed.

“We just don’t know how long 

some of the things will take,” he 
said.

In February 2014, the U.S. 

Department 
of 
Education 

announced it would launch a feder-
al investigation of the University’s 
handling of sexual misconduct, 
prompted by two Title IX com-
plaints submitted to the Depart-
ment’s Office of Civil Rights.

One of these complaints, lodged 

by Douglas Smith, a former pro-
fessor of pathology at the Univer-
sity, alleged that the University 
mishandled sexual misconduct 
allegations against former Michi-
gan kicker Brendan Gibbons. In 
January 2014, the Daily reported 
Gibbons had been permanently 
separated from the University for 
violating the student sexual mis-
conduct policy.

The University supplied hun-

dreds of pages of documents 
related to sexual misconduct 
on campus to the Office of Civil 
Rights, including its policies 
governing sexual violence, any 
changes to those policies and the 
names of personnel responsible 
for 
investigating 
complaints. 

It also provided all formal and 
informal 
complaints 
of 
dis-

crimination, and all e-mail cor-
respondence regarding sexual 
misconduct.

In 
September, 
the 
Daily 

requested access to many of the 
documents the University pro-
vided to the U.S. Department of 
Education, which the Univer-
sity’s FOIA office appraised at 
$1,720.

The Daily revised its request in 

December to include only a por-
tion of the documents involved 
in the investigation, which the 
office said would cost $890. The 
Daily paid the first half of this 
fee in January, but the University 
has not yet produced the docu-
ments.

“There are a number of uni-

versities that seem to have a 
culture of obstructionism, and 
Michigan is certainly among 
them,” LoMonte said. “We’ve 
had recurring problems over the 
years of a culture of non-trans-
parency.”

Briggs-Bunting, who noted 

that two months “is more than 
adequate” for the University to 
produce the documents request-
ed by the Daily, said the Univer-
sity seems to be “dragging its 
feet.”

“They’re also playing a game 

because it’s not necessarily infor-
mation that (they) want to go out 
in the public,” she said. “Cer-
tainly that’s not something that 
other public institutions haven’t 
attempted to do in the past.”

Under a revised version of 

FOIA, effective July 1, public 
bodies will be required to pro-
vide an estimate of when records 
will be provided. Though the time 
estimate will not be binding, pub-
lic institutions will be required 
to “provide the estimate in good 
faith and strive to be reasonably 
accurate.”

Fitzgerald said the University 

will comply with state law when 
the revisions take effect, but for 
now the University does not have 
processes in place to provide a 
timeline estimate.

how much of an impact could be 
made on education at the federal 
level.

“We’re continuing to just chip 

away at this problem — there’s 
no silver bullet,” Obama said 
Wednesday. “We’re going to 
have to do things at the federal 
level, the state level and the uni-
versity level to really mobilize 
the entire country around the 
issue of college affordability.”

The Student Aid Bill of Rights 

reads as follows:

“Every student deserves access 

to a quality, affordable education 
at a college that’s cutting costs 
and increasing learning.

Every student should be able 

to access the resources needed 
to pay for college.

Every borrower has the right 

to an affordable repayment plan.

And, every borrower has 

the right to quality customer 
service, 
reliable 
information 

and fair treatment, even if they 
struggle to repay their loans.”

In support of the Bill of 

Rights, the memorandum is also 
meant to create policy solutions 
that will provide support for stu-
dents repaying loan debt, Obama 
said. According to a White 
House report, more than 70 per-
cent of today’s bachelor degree 
graduates leave with a debt, 
which is on average $28,400.

In the state of Michigan, 

there are currently 1,516,000 
student borrowers with about 
$40.1 billion in outstanding stu-
dent loans.

“I believe that America is not 

a place where higher education 
is a privilege that is reserved for 
the few,” Obama said Tuesday in 
Georgia. “America needs to be a 
place where higher education has 
to be available for every single 
person who’s willing to strive for 
it, who’s willing to work for it.”

During his speech, the presi-

dent outlined three major com-
ponents of his program: creating 
a “responsive” student feedback 
system, promoting more afford-
able monthly payments and bet-
ter meeting the needs of student 
borrowers.

Under the memorandum, by 

July 1, 2016, the Department of 
Education is charged with cre-
ating a website for students to 
file complaints and feedback on 
federal student loan lenders, ser-
vicers, collections agencies, uni-
versities and colleges.

The system aims to improve 

the timeliness of the Depart-
ment of Education’s response to 
student borrowers. The presi-
dent also said he wants to work 
with the Department of Educa-
tion to study better responses to 
potential illegal activity pertain-
ing both to loan regulation, and 
to how colleges and universities 
market themselves to students.

Other components of the 

memorandum include ensuring 
that borrowers are able to meet 
their monthly loan payments. To 
achieve that objective, the gov-
ernment will work to increase 
transparency in the student loan 

process by informing borrowers 
when their loans are transferred 
to a different service, as well as 
informing borrowers when they 
lag in their payments or do not 
complete applications to adjust 
their payment plans.

Additionally, the memoran-

dum calls for the creation of 
“centralized point of access” to 
help students pay back federal 
student loans, as well as require-
ments for loan providers to allow 
students to pay back loans with 
the highest interest rate.

During Wednesday’s confer-

ence call, Arne Duncan, the U.S. 
secretary of education, detailed 
the thinking behind providing 
these “centralized point of access.”

“One is an integrated com-

plaint system, where we want 
borrowers to be able to report 
to us on difficulties that they are 
having. That will help us resolve 
difficulties better and under-
stand better how our servicers 
are performing,” Duncan said. 
“The other is an integrated data-
base that will allow borrowers, 
in one spot, to look at the balanc-
es of all of their student loans, 
and begin there to make choices 
how to allocate payments among 
those loans.”

The president also announced 

several partnerships to create 
programs aimed at facilitating 
payment of student loans.

The White House Office of Sci-

ence and Technology Policy will 
work to improve communication 
between lenders and borrowers 
and create payment plans with 
borrower habits in mind. The 
Office of Management and Budget 
will study payment plan trends to 
create policies better adjusted to 
the student borrowers.

The president will also ask offi-

cials from all areas of government 
to improve lending practices and 
implement 
performance-based 

metrics to evaluate them.

While Obama’s memoran-

dum introduces several new 
plans, it builds on several piec-
es of legislation passed during 
his administration.

The first point of the Bill of 

Rights is to allow every student 
access to a low cost post-high 
school education. To accomplish 
this, Obama cited his proposed 
two years of free community 
college education, as well as 
his administration’s First in 
the World Grants, to which the 
Department of Education allo-
cated $75 million in September. 
Obama has since proposed an 
increase to $200 million.

To ensure that every student in 

America can afford to go to col-
lege, the Obama administration 
has also increased the maximum 
Pell Grant award to $5,730 in the 
2014-2015 academic year, which 
is almost $1,000 more than the 
2008 maximum. The president 
has also proposed additional 
increases so the Pell Grant maxi-
mum keeps up with inflation.

The necessity for the increase 

in grants was highlighted by 
Stephen Culbertson, the com-
munications director for the 
University’s chapter of the Col-
lege Democrats, as especially 
pertinent in Ann Arbor.

“The perfect example of [the 

need for financial aid reform] is 
here at the University of Michi-
gan,” Culbertson said. “The lack 
of economic diversity on the 
campus is kind of indicative of 
how prohibitive the cost of high-
er education is becoming, and 
particularly higher education 
is becoming at high-level public 
institutions. There’s not enough 
being done. Federal programs 
can only go so far, a lot of the 
problem lies at the state level. 
There’s not adequate funding.”

The University’s chapter of 

the College Republicans did not 
respond to a request for com-
ment Wednesday.

Mark Kantrowitz, the publish-

er of Edvisors Network, a national 
organization that assists students 
find financial aid opportunities, 
said he was optimistic about the 
latest proposals, but felt that there 
was still more to be done.

“It’s a step in the right direc-

tion,” Kantrowitz said. “It gath-
ers together several interesting 
proposals that, on the whole, will 
provide some benefits, such as 
the proposal to require federal 
loan servicers to apply prepay-
ments to the highest rate loan.”

Though he said he was happy 

to hear that financial aid was a 
topic of discussion, he added that 
he was unsure if all the presi-
dent’s proposals were feasible 
without congressional action.

“I think it’s going to provide 

some good, but it’s not going to 
be earth-shaking in its effects,” 
Kantrowitz said. “It’ll help some 
students — borrowers who are 
struggling — but it’s not increas-
ing the amount of money for 
grants, for example. It’s not 
teaching people to borrow only 
what they can afford, and I think 
those are key problems that need 
to be addressed.”

Culbertson also said there was 

a need for student financial aid 
reform, but was unsure about how 
much could be done about student 
financial aid at the federal level.

“In and of itself, the Student 

Aid Bill of Rights is not so much 
a policy solution,” he said. “It’s 
kind of broad directives that 
President Obama has released 
to kind of signal that ‘this is an 
issue we are looking at more 
closely on the federal level and 
we as the government care 
about, that we want to make col-
lege more affordable, we want to 
make taking out a student loan 
more clear and simplified.’ ”

In the conference call with 

reporters, the president urged 
readers who agreed with the 
proposal to sign a statement of 
support at whitehouse.gov/col-
legeopportunity.

“We want to mobilize the 

energy and focus the attention of 
everybody nationally around the 
basic principles to make it easier 
to get young people to have the 
education they need,” Obama 
said. “We don’t want to allow 
higher education to become a 
luxury. It’s an economic impera-
tive that every American family 
should be able to afford.”

children are there,” said Dawsey.

Education 
Prof. 
Eliza-

beth 
Moje, 
associate 
dean 

for research and communi-
ty engagement, agreed with 
Dawsey that the current school 
system lacks stability.

“There is a lack of stabil-

ity and a bounty of confusion, 
which makes the work of build-
ing leaders and teachers incred-
ibly difficult,” she said.

This is the second “The 

Future of Education in Detroit” 
event. According to Mahima 
Mahadevan, project manager 
in the Public Policy School, the 
first talk made it clear that more 
discussion about Detroit educa-
tion was needed.

“We felt an ongoing discus-

sion was the most appropriate 
format to bring in the many voic-
es and perspectives on this topic, 
having started with three panel-
ists for the first event,” Mahade-
van said. “We started planning 
soon after for a following event.”

Mahadevan said she ensured 

each of the speakers had a strong 
tie to Detroit.

“Our focus is to invite speak-

ers with a personal stake in the 
education system in Detroit in 
order to share their understand-
ing of the issues with our audi-
ence,” Mahadevan said.

Detroit native Tawana Petty, 

another 
panelist, 
said 
she 

brought her own perspective to 
the topic of education in the city.

“I am representing as a mom, 

an organizer, author, poet — 
someone who has come through 
… Detroit Public Schools, and 
raised a son through Detroit 
Public Schools,” she said.

As a graduate of the DPS, 

Petty stressed the current strug-
gle she finds between so many 
subcomponents of the district.

“The struggle between char-

ters, between public schools, 
between 
board 
members, 

between 
coalitions, 
between 

foundations — pretty much any 
entity that feels that they have a 
vested interest in the education of 
young people in Detroit,” she said.

Petty is a member of the 

James and Grace Lee Boggs 
Center board, an initiative that 
works to better Detroit commu-
nities, in part through advocat-
ing for changes in education. She 
said the board is pushing to take 
Detroit away from what she calls 
a binary system of education, 
meaning people are either edu-
cated or they are not. Petty said 
they do this by fostering educa-
tional opportunities outside of 
the traditional classroom setting, 
as well as by exploring alterna-
tive educational systems.

“When we look at alterna-

tives, we look at re-spiriting 
young people’s inherent gifts 

and nurturing their imagina-
tions,” she said. “We’re looking 
at providing them an opportuni-
ty to envision what their future 
can look like whether or not they 
go to college, whether or not 
they get a ‘good job. ’ ”

Moje said she finds panels 

exceptionally important for fos-
tering educational reform, partic-
ularly in a city like Detroit, where 
the school system is frequently 
known for “systematic failure.”

“We need to hear from people 

who live and work in Detroit 
about what they see as the edu-
cation needs of their children 
and youth,” Moje said.

During his speech, Lamont 

Satchel, chief innovation officer 
for DPS, placed his focus on fund-
ing within the district. He said 
the financial issues Detroit faces 
are also faced by other districts.

Particularly in Detroit, pan-

elists said funding issues and 
a growing number of charter 
schools caused massive cuts 
throughout the system. With 
students shuffled from school 
to school as they close, many 
children end up leaving the dis-
trict to attend another school or 
drop out altogether. Satchel said, 
when children leave the district 
for schooling, DPS loses even 
more funding.

“You reach a point where 

you have to ask yourself: is this 
working?” Satchel said.

many of us have been raised and 
socialized and taught to believe 
that it’s OK?” she said.

To build a positive climate 

on campus, LSA junior Micah 
Griggs said students shouldn’t 
depend on others to take action.

“We can’t just wait for the 

next class and hope they want 
to make change,” Griggs said.

LSA sophomore Steven Hal-

perin, the Make Michigan vice 
presidential candidate in the 
upcoming Central Student Gov-
ernment elections, spoke about 
how the classes that fulfill the 
University’s race and ethnicity 
requirement do not adequately 
teaching students about the 
challenges faced by minori-
ties today because they largely 
focus on the past.

“A lot of the time with these 

short conversations, it’s easy to 
take out of it a message,” Hal-
perin said. “But you’re not real-
ly getting deep into the topic.”

Simpson asked students if 

they felt the president of the 
University of Oklahoma was 
right in expelling the fraternity 
leaders of that university’s SAE 
chapter responsible for a racist 
chant.

Responding to the argument 

that students were expressing 
their right to free speech, Rack-
ham student Portia Hemphill 
said she believes OU’s president 
handled the situation well, as 
the idea of free speech is con-
ditional and should not impede 
the civil liberties of others. Fur-
thermore, she said because the 
president was an older white 

man from a southern state, he 
set the tone for how future situ-
ations of this nature should be 
handled.

Other students felt, though 

these particular students were 
expelled, the measure may have 
been ineffective at getting at the 
larger problem of racism within 
the OU community.

LSA senior Joshua Thur-

man said the video should be a 
call for all college students to 
address the issue of racial preju-
dice on campuses, even if it does 
not feel pressing because the 
instance only occurred at OU.

“It’s about making the con-

nection of how that video 
relates to our campus climate,” 
he said, “And even though we 
don’t have people on video 
right now singing songs like 
that, there are other instances 
and other manifestations of the 
same thing happening here.”

A racially insensitive party 

theme created by the University 
Theta Xi chapter played a role 
in spurring the Black Student 
Union’s Black Student Union’s 
#BBUM 
Twitter 
campaign, 

which launched a campuswide 
conversation about race on 
campus.

When asked about what a 

diverse 
campus 
community 

means to her, Harper said it is a 
community that fosters a sense 
that the people around you mat-
ter. She said both communities 
and individuals lose when peo-
ple do not learn from those with 
different backgrounds.

“The gift is to yourself, 

because I better understand me 
when I’m trying to understand 
you,” Harper said.

L

ast night, I had dinner with a 
cousin with whom I haven’t 
had a real discussion in a 

while. She, an alum 
of Harvard and 
Stanford and now a 
federal prosecutor, 
is some 10 years my 
senior. Suffice it to 
say, we’ve rarely 
had much com-
mon ground from 
which to stimulate 
discussion at Pass-
over every other 
year, when I was 
going through my awkward phase 
(OK, it’s still going, but you get my 
point). Now, for really the first time, 
we could share a meal, a drink and 
carry a conversation.

Naturally, as tends to be the case 

with family, the dialogue inevitably 
turned to relationships. We spoke 
about hers (she’s been in one for 18 
months), mine (previous, not current) 
as well as our siblings’. An analogous 
thread became obvious — Cahans, 
as a family that gravitates towards 
high-stress occupations (doctors, law-
yers, the whole shtick), appear on the 
surface to date characters far more, 
shall we say, ‘relaxed’ than us. I guess 
there’s something in the water.

In any case, the law of romantic 

complements dictates that we are 
compelled to seek the yins to our 
yangs. 
Indeed, 
opposites attract. 

That always was the espoused truth 
for interactions in physics, as with 
physical interactions. So the rela-
tionship parallels we noticed are 
none too surprising, according to the 
 traditional doctrine.

However, recent research shows that 

the eternal mantra of synergistic differ-
ences in relationships may not be valid.

A fascinating article from the sta-

tistical blog FiveThirtyEight, titled “In 
the End, People May Really Just Want 
to Date Themselves,” challenges the 
pervading logic. The article, through 
thorough statistical analyses based on 
data sets from eHarmony, illustrates 

that “birds of a feather flock together.” 
Further, the avian phenomenon takes 
flight in two ways: firstly, people gen-
erally prefer those with traits like 
them and secondly, everyone prefers 
certain traits, and indicate even stron-
ger preference with regards to those 
which they, too, personify. To clarify: 
everyone likes blue birds. Red birds 
like blue birds. Red birds also like red 
birds. But blue birds really like blue 
birds. Amazingly, 23andme data actu-
ally codifies this nesting logic at the 
genetic level as well.

Now, to use another metaphor, this 

explains why we order what we order 
when we get to the restaurant. But 
how do we find the restaurant in the 
first place?

Another article, this time from 

practical-science blog Nautilus, titled 
“Casual Sex May be Improving Amer-
ica’s Marriages,” sheds some light on 
the question. The piece, written by 
the Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.
com, reveals a seemingly paradoxical 
point: one-night stands might actually 
be helping American marriages. The 
author, Dr. Helen Fisher, explains that 
one-night stands are but the initial step 
in a sequential, “slow love” process. 
Thereafter, the progression moves 
to “friends with benefits” (“commit-
ment-lite”), and then “devoted mating 
partner” (“commitment-heavy”), and 
then finally, formal marriage. ‘Delib-
erate’ seems the adjective of choice in 
comparison with the full force gale of 
historical companionship. Partner-
ship must be personified before being 
signed into the legal codes.

Nonetheless, there has been ample 

handwringing over the millennial 
marriage issue. Much has been writ-
ten on the delayed nature of millennial 
marriages. Numerically speaking, the 
average pre-marriage relationships 
takes between 18 to 34 months and 46 
percent fewer millennials are married 
between ages 18 to 32, when compared 
to the baby boomers.

What to make of the concern?
It seems to me that the concern is 

misplaced. Neuroscientific research 

suggests two distinct timeframes in 
the early life of romantic relationships. 
The first, dominating the first eight 
months of relationships, is a sort of 
euphoria — the technical term being 
“limerence.” Neural circuitry in the 
subcortical, dopamine-rich, immedi-
ate reward regions is most active. The 
second timeframe blooms during the 
eight- to 17-month period, and reflects 
a sort of romantic commitment. Neu-
ral circuitry in the caudate body, asso-
ciated with reward deference, is most 
active. In other words, the romantic 
lens does not widen to include a long-
term horizon until between eight and 
17 months. Assuming couples wait 
around a year after engagement to get 
married, this falls right into the aver-
age pre-marriage length for relation-
ships mentioned above.

So, though in my previous piece I 

mentioned the “rationality” of millen-
nial relationships, perhaps my word 
choice was off. Rather, our relation-
ships appear intensely and intimately 
visceral. Driven by an incessant fear 
of a risk on the one hand and a slowly 
developing neuro-sensory attachment 
on the other, we are relying on our 
own feelings to navigate the seas of 
romance more than ever. We are wait-
ing until we’re ready because that’s 
when it feels right. We are partial to 
those most like us because they feel 
familiar, comforting and consistent 
amidst an ocean of uncertainty.

The other thing I forgot to mention 

about Cahans is that, for some odd 
reason, there hasn’t been a marriage 
yet in my generation. Long-term com-
panionship abounds, but legal part-
nership is nowhere to be found. Maybe 
we should date people more like us. Or 
maybe we should go out more (that 
much is certainly true). Or maybe, just 
maybe, we, like so many other millen-
nials, are just trying to weave our way 
through the waves that so poignantly 
symbolize the ups and downs of love.

No rush.

A

dhering to its company policy of “no judgment,” recent action 
taken to ensure a transgender-friendly environment at a local 
branch of Planet Fitness in Midland, Mich. has raised public 

concern regarding transgender rights and individual rights to privacy. 
The company displayed a highly commendable response to the continual 
complaints made to employees and to other members about the presence of 
a transgender female in the women’s locker room at the gym. In response, 
Planet Fitness withdrew the membership of the complaining patron. 
According to a statement issued by the public relations director of Planet 
Fitness, members are allowed to utilize a locker room “corresponding 
with their gender identity.” Despite the progressive stance taken by Planet 
Fitness, these events illustrate the need to re-evaluate the current state of 
transgender protections and to promote anti-discriminatory policies at 
both the national and state level.

Protections for transgender individuals are 

severely lacking. According to the Transgender 
Law and Policy Institute, only 16 states — 
in addition to the District of Columbia — 
uphold legislation that forbids discrimination 
based upon an individual’s gender identity 
or expression. Michigan is not included 
among these states. In addition, transgender 
individuals are prohibited from serving openly 
in any branch of the armed forces, and under 
regulations, these individuals are deemed “unfit 
for service.” However, a recent army regulation 
minimally inhibits the discharge process of 
transgender service members by requiring the 
discharge procedures to be authorized by the 
assistant secretary of the army. Furthermore, 
these steps are small and ambiguous.

Currently, no legislation dictating which 

restroom an individual can use exists in the 
state of Michigan, similar to many other 
states. An individual who uses a restroom that 
doesn’t correspond with their biological sex 
could potentially be charged with “disturbing 
the peace.” Recent legislation proposed in 
Kentucky, Florida and Texas has sought to 
impose restrictions on transgender individuals 
from using a restroom that corresponds with 
their preferred gender identity. The bills 
propose varying degrees of fines or penalties 
for violating the provision.

While transgender protections and resources 

at the national and state level need to undergo 
major reform, the University maintains a fairly 
progressive approach to ensuring an inclusive 
environment. The Spectrum Center offers 
a wide array of resources for transgender 
faculty and students, and the University itself 
features a non-discriminatory employment 
policy for faculty. The University, likewise, 
offers gender-inclusive housing for students 
and gender-neutral restrooms across campus. 
For example, the Gender Inclusive Living 
Experience includes a section of rooms in 
East Quad and gender-inclusive restrooms are 
located in East Quad, Alice Lloyd, Markley, 
Mosher-Jordan and Baits II residence halls. 
One drawback of the University’s approach is 
that available resources are under-publicized. 
Ensuring an inclusive campus environment 
is an issue of importance for most on campus, 
and yet, many students may be unaware of 
the existence of gender-neutral programs and 
areas. The goal of the University — as well as 
the state and the nation at large — should be 
to be considerate of all individuals. Through 
numerous institutions and public structures, 
we must ensure that adequate gender-neutral 
options are widely available and that action 
is taken to provide a welcoming and safe 
environment for all individuals.

Protecting all identities

FROM THE DAILY

MATT FIDEL | VIEWPOINT

Moving on, moving forward

My fellow Wolverines,
As an elected representative of the Central 

Student Government and as a member of 
Greek life, I owe each and every member of 
the University community an apology. Over 
the weekend of January 16-18, my fraternity 
and I went on a ski trip. On that ski trip, some 
members caused extensive damage to the 
host resort. While my fraternity is making full 
restitution to the owner, the destruction was 
appalling and inexcusable, and I condemn it in 
the harshest terms. I am even more saddened by 
the damage that my fellow students caused to 
the reputation of the University. It pains me to 
know that members of my own fraternity were 
able to tarnish the good name of our fraternity, 
Michigan Greek life and the entire University.

Let me say in the clearest terms — I did not 

commit any damage to the resort, nor did I 
witness any destruction as it was taking place. 
When I discovered what had happened, I was 
horrified and deeply ashamed of the behavior 
of my peers. I immediately began working with 
other members of my fraternity to mitigate 
and control the situation to prevent further 
destruction.

As a leader on this campus, I am accountable 

to each of you. Leaders do not run away from 
problems; they confront them and work toward 
solutions. Since that weekend, I have helped lead 
my fraternity brothers in an attempt to right the 
wrongs that were committed. I organized four 
build sites through Habitat for Humanity that will 
be dedicated shortly. In order to begin mending 
the ties with our neighboring communities, I 
planned a chapter service trip to Detroit, with 
the help of The Detroit Partnership. I am a strong 
believer in the principle of restorative justice, and 
the fraternity is working to repair relations with 
our neighbors.

I refuse to be defined by the actions of others. 

My record speaks for itself. I have dedicated 
my time on campus to positive, worthwhile 
causes and have worked to impact meaningful 
change. While serving on the boards of SRC 
and GARP, I devoted time to maintaining Greek 
self-governance, 
safety 
and 
responsibility. 

As an LSA representative on Central Student 
Government, I have pursued change within 
the dining department, planned events such as 
the Police Brutality Speak-out and worked to 
increase diversity on campus by serving on CSG’s 
On-Site Admissions Task Force. I have met with 
administrators to discuss problems on campus, 
and I have worked with administrators to create 

solutions to these problems. Most recently, I 
worked with the Dining Department to design a 
program that will allow students to donate their 
leftover Dining Dollars and Blue Bucks at the 
end of the year to local food pantries. Beginning 
at the end of March, all students will be able to 
donate money in $1 increments at all campus 
stores, like U-Go’s, Victors and the Blue Apple. 
The money that is raised will be used to purchase 
local, sustainable, non-perishable food that will 
be donated to local food pantries, including our 
campus’ own student food pantry. As a student 
leader, I have worked to represent the interests of 
fellow students and to build a better campus for 
all communities.

As a candidate for CSG vice president with The 

Team, I plan to continue and expand upon this 
important work. I want to ensure that as the voice 
of the students, our CSG is representative of all 
communities on campus, not just those of a few. 
It’s time for all students to have easy, convenient 
access to their elected representatives so that 
CSG gives students a chance to share their ideas 
and accomplish their goals. CSG has tremendous 
potential to be a driver of collaboration with 
and empowerment of student leaders, not of 
competition and politics. Student leaders should 
be able to rely on CSG’s budget, administration 
connections and clout as a platform to advance 
their great work on campus. Together, we can 
support and empower student leaders across 
campus to better address important issues such 
as increased minority enrollment, increased 
sexual assault awareness and prevention efforts 
and an improved campus climate. By working 
together, our collective potential is much greater 
than that of any individual.

I ask you to judge me based on my 

accomplishments 
and 
my 
ideas 
rather 

than on the actions of some members of 
my fraternity. I am not my fraternity. I am 
Matt Fidel. I am running for Vice President 
because I see the great potential of CSG, and I 
want to continue serving you. I am a member 
of The Team, and together we can focus on 
the real opportunities and challenges that lie 
ahead. With your input and support, we can 
partner to accomplish our shared goals. We 
have serious work to do, and I look forward to 
getting started.

Feel free to e-mail me at mhfidel@umich.edu 

if you have any questions or ideas that you would 
like to discuss together.

Matt Fidel is an LSA sophomore.

“I

t sounded like a good idea 
seven months ago!”

I ran past a bystander 

holding this sign 
during 
my 
first 

half-marathon 
and fluttered back 
and forth between 
wanting to laugh 
and 
wanting 
to 

punch 
him. 
My 

friend Crystal and 
I signed up for the 
Disney 
Princess 

Half 
Marathon 

over the summer, 
thinking the February race would 
motivate us to keep up our running 
routines during the winter. We took 
into account that the race would 
require us to train hardest during the 
coldest, snowiest time of the year, but 
we quickly brushed this off. “We’ll get 
cute winter running gear!” we ratio-
nalized, and booked our tickets to 
sunny Florida.

Fast forward to three weeks ago. 

Crystal and I stepped off the plane in 
Orlando sporting sneakers and leg-
gings, pretending to be runners. I wish 
I could say our cute winter running 
gear allowed us to stick to a training 
plan. I wish I could say we diligently 
ran our mid-week speed workouts 
next to each other on the Landmark 
treadmills while we looked out the 
windows at the snow. But if I’m being 
honest, our training mostly consisted 
of logging a quick two miles every five 
days or so, combined with an occa-
sional cross-training routine where 
we watched Bravo while pretending 
to do planks on Lululemon yoga mats.

In the two days leading up to the 

race we walked around the Disney 
parks, attempting to pick out our fel-
low runners. This was much more 
difficult than it seemed, considering 
running shorts and tennis shoes seem 
to be an unspoken uniform for all 
theme park attendees. We wondered if 
anyone was looking at us, trying to fig-
ure out if we were runners, looked at 
each other, and laughed. If they were, 
we made it difficult for them to guess 
due to the fishbowl-sized margarita 
and jumbo-sized order of nachos we 
were carrying around.

On Saturday night, we decided 

to get serious about the race. At that 
point, though, all “training” efforts 
would be useless, and the best we 

could do was hydrate and carb-load 
for our long run the next morning. 
Unfortunately, all of the other 20,000 
runners came prepared, taking up all 
the reservations at the Italian res-
taurants across Disney World. We 
settled for tacos from a quick-service 
Mexican booth and a pastry from a 
French bakery.

The race began at 5:30 in the morn-

ing, and due to the large number of 
people participating, Disney sug-
gested boarding the buses by 4 a.m. 
Logically, our fellow runners began 
leaving the parks around 7 p.m. on 
Saturday night to get a good night’s 
rest. Crystal and I found the temp-
tation of a nearly empty park and 
short wait times for popular rides to 
be entirely too strong, and ended up 
staying at the park until closing. We 
did not see the error of our ways until 
our alarm went off just a few hours 
after we set it. Time to run.

After stumbling around in the dark 

to find our tennis shoes and bibs, we 
hopped on a bus. Once we got to the 
pre-race area, we were able to stretch 
a bit and take some photos. It was 55 
degrees that morning, or, as it’s known 
locally here in Michigan, a heat wave.

If you’ve never seen pictures from 

a Disney race, it looks pretty different 
than your typical half marathon. Rac-
ers sport tutus and costumes resem-
bling their favorite Disney characters, 
and about every half-mile, there is a 
different character photo spot where 
you can wait in line to take a picture 
with Mickey or Buzz Lightyear. A 
fairy godmother sends each of the 16 
corrals on their way, and fireworks 
accompany each of these starts. It’s 
one of the least intimidating long-
distance races, which probably con-
tributes to the fact that over half of 
the runners were first time half-mar-
athoners. Solidarity, group of Cinder-
ellas to my left. To quote my favorite 
Disney Channel original movie, we’re 
all in this together.

Since we were in one of the middle 

corrals, we didn’t actually cross the 
starting line until 6 a.m. As we ran 
past mile marker three, we saw some 
of the fastest runners blow by mile 
marker 10. Crystal turned to me, eyes 
wide, and shouted “life goals!” above 
the music. I looked back with my eye-
brow raised. My parents always told 
me I could do anything I set my mind 
to, but I’m pretty sure running a half 

marathon in under an hour and a half 
is out of my reach. I was just out there 
trying to finish the race.

One of the most famous aspects 

of the Princess Half is the fact that 
around the halfway mark, participants 
get to run through Cinderella’s Castle 
in Magic Kingdom. Up until that point 
we felt great, which was amazing con-
sidering the last time we ran six miles 
was in November. Once we reached 
this point, though, Crystal’s ankle — 
previously weakened by a September 
football pregame-related ankle injury 
involving a ledge and a few trips to the 
nearest urgent care center — began 
bugging her. We hobbled along until 
we found a medic tent, which was 
about the same time we discovered the 
free Clif Shots volunteers were pass-
ing out. These small pouches of saving 
grace provided the same effect as if we 
were in a video game and collected an 
extra life — our fictional battery power 
meters returned to 100 percent.

From then on, it was pretty smooth 

sailing. We really tried to focus on stay-
ing in the moment, noticing what dif-
ferent causes people were running for 
and enjoying this experience the two 
of us got to have together. Toward the 
end of the race the course goes up an 
overpass, and the vantage point allows 
runners to see the thousands of people 
following them on their journey to 13.1 
miles. Around this point, it hit me that 
I was going to finish a half marathon 
with my best friend and accomplish a 
goal I didn’t have the confidence to go 
after alone.

We crossed the finish line and col-

lected our medals, not able to fully 
comprehend that we actually just 
completed the race. We spent the next 
few days walking around the parks 
in our race swag, looking like two old 
ladies who needed canes a result of 
not training properly. But that was 
 

worth it.

We’re half marathoners now. Of 

course, we definitely should have 
trained more consistently. But we 
didn’t use our failure to prepare as an 
excuse to hold us back from our goal. I 
think sometimes all you need is a best 
friend and a fairy godmother to ignore 
all the reasons why you can’t accom-
plish a dream. I know I’m grateful 
 

for mine.

CSG proposes committee 

for fossil fuel disinvestment

Monday, a proposal to

committee to research the 
University’s investments in 
oil and coal was brought to 
Central

Govern-

ment by CSG representative 
Swathi Shanmugasundaram, 
an LSA sophomore, and the 
Divest and Invest campaign, 
a coalition of students, fac-
ulty, staff and community 
members. The proposal was 
questioned by CSG Presi-
dent Bobby Dishell, a Public 
Policy senior, who want-
ed the group to perform 
research 
without

University 
has 
recently 

severed ties with Sigma 
Alpha Mu, one of the fra-

3 THINGS to do this 

weekend

By EMILIE PLESSET

Daily Weekend Editor

The temperature is finally 

above 40 degrees and the Diag is 
underwater. Spring has sprung 
in Ann Arbor and it’s time to 
do something fun. If you’re 
ready to break out of your win-
ter hibernation, here are some 
things you can do this weekend 
to embrace the new season.

FRIDAY, MARCH 13

If you find yourself with some 

post-midterms free time, start 
reading the popular “Diver-
gent” trilogy before the film 
adaption of the sequel, “Insur-
gent,” hits theaters next Friday, 
March 20. The series follows 
16-year-old 
Beatrice 
“Tris” 

Prior as she endures a society in 
a future dystopian Chicago that 
categorizes people into five fac-
tions and eliminates those who 
exercise independence from the 
system. While you’re at it, if you 
can’t get enough of the Diver-
gent universe, you might also 
want to re-watch the film ver-
sion of the first book, “Diver-
gent.”

SATURDAY, MARCH 14

Looking for a culture fix? The 

Detroit Institute of Arts will 
open its exhibition on the year 
20th-century Mexican artists 
Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo 
spent in Detroit. The exhibi-
tion will open Saturday evening 

and guests are encouraged to 
wear rebozos, bright colors 
and flowers. The opening will 
include appetizers and enter-
tainment by Mariachi Gallos 
de Oro and Ballet Folklorico 
Mayocoyani Izel. Tickets can 
be purchased online for $25.

SUNDAY, MARCH 15

After spending the school 

year fundraising, the efforts of 
the University’s Dance Mara-
thon will finally culminate in 
its 18th annual fundraising 

rave this weekend. Through-
out the year, the organization 
has been raising money to sup-
port therapy programs at the 
University’s C.S. Mott Chil-
dren’s Hospital and William 
Beaumont Children’s Hospital 
in Royal Oak. Beginning Satur-
day at 2 p.m., hundreds of stu-
dents will stand for 24 hours as 
they dance and play with chil-
dren who are benefiting from 
the raised money. If you’re not 
already participating, make 
sure you stop by to support 
your friends at DMUM.

impacted 

other cultures from around the 
world,” said LSA senior Olubisi 
Ajetunmobi, president of ASA.

Emceed by prominent Afri-

can comedian Foxy P, the event 
will showcase a variety of per-
formances highlighting Afri-
can culture and its influence 
around the world. In addition 
to a fashion show and perfor-
mances by University dance 
groups, the event will feature 
a performance by the Kenyan 
Zuzu Acrobats, an acrobatic 
team that previously competed 
on “America’s Got Talent.”

According to Ajetunmobi, 

the culture show started two 
years after the ASA was found-
ed on campus in 1996 and has 
been an annual installment 
since. The culture show was 

originally a smaller event in the 
Michigan Union, but has since 
expanded considerably and has 
been hosted in the Power Cen-
ter for the past two years.

This year, ASA is moving the 

production to the Michigan 
Theater in hopes that the new 
location will allow for further 
expansion.

The culture show will also 

include Amala, Oga Boys and 
Brazilian Capoeira dance per-
formances. Additionally, many 
prominent fashion designers, 
singers, musicians and poets 
from all over the nation will 
showcase their work.

“We just hope that students 

who come to the show see that 
there’s more to Africa than 
what they see on the news or 
on TV,” Ajetunmobi said. “We 
also want to show how impact-
ful Africa is to so many cul-
tures around the world.”

ASA is co-sponsoring the 

evASA is co-sponsoring the 
event with the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs, Central 

and LSA student governments 
and the Multicultural Coun-
cils in most residence halls.

Tickets are $5 for students 

and $8 for non-students. How-
ever, students can attend the 
show for free if they pick up 
a Passport to the Arts ticket 

in any residence hall or at the 
New Student Programs center 
in the LSA Building.

‘M’ underdog in Big Ten Tournament 

By LEV FACHER 

Managing Editor

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team has played Illinois twice in 
the 2014-2015 season, earning 
a hard-fought win on Dec. 30 
in Ann Arbor but imploding in 
overtime 
in 

Champaign 
on 
Feb. 
12, 

suffering 
a 

12-point loss.

The 

Wolverines 
(8-10 Big Ten, 
15-15 
overall) 

get a chance 
to 
take 
the 

season 
series 

Thursday in the 
second 
round 

of the Big Ten 
Tournament 
at the United 
Center in Chicago.

Michigan, the No. 9 seed 

in the tournament, is a slight 
underdog against the eighth-
seeded Fighting Illini (9-9, 19-12). 
The winner, regardless, has little 
reason for broader optimism, as 
top-seeded Wisconsin has the 
luxury of resting and waiting 
to take on the second-round 
survivor on Friday.

For 
the 
Wolverines’ 
few 

veterans, the underdog status is 
unfamiliar. Senior forward Max 
Bielfeldt, for instance, recalls 
entering the tournament as the 
No. 2 seed in 2012, No. 5 seed in 
2013 and No. 1 seed in 2014.

“We just have a different 

mentality going in,” Bielfeldt 
said, “just knowing that to make 
some noise, we have to surprise 
people.

“We have to go in and beat 

Illinois and beat Wisconsin, 
which is the Big Ten’s best team 
right now. … In the past, that’s 
been us.”

The Wolverines could have 

easily earned a higher seed if 
it weren’t for a series of games 

they struggled to close out, 
including an overtime loss to 
Michigan State and a double-
overtime heartbreaker last week 
at Northwestern.

The Feb. 12 game at Illinois 

was another example. After 
holding a slight edge over Illinois 
for much of regulation in the 
defensive 
struggle, 
Michigan 

ran out of gas. The Fighting Illini 
finished the game on a 21-2 run — 
the Wolverines’ late-game 50-43 
lead vanished in the blink of an 
eye, and they lost handily, 64-52.

“When we think things are 

really stagnant, what are we 
going to do?” Beilein said when 
asked how Michigan would stand 
up to similar runs in the future. 
“Punch the ball inside and get to 
the foul line.”

The Wolverines’ ability to 

punch the ball inside is much 
improved by the return of 
freshman forward Ricky Doyle 
from an intestinal virus. His 
absence allowed Bielfeldt to take 
the reigns on Senior Day — he 
posted his first career double-
double in his first career start. But 

Bielfeldt’s 6-foot-7 frame might 
not cut it against Illinois’ Nnanna 
Egwu, who stands 6-foot-11 and 
wreaked havoc with Michigan’s 
ability to inbound the ball in 
its second matchup with the 
Fighting Illini.

Doyle, Beilein said, is ready to 

go, but he still isn’t a player who’s 
necessarily capable of throwing 
inbounds passes in critical, late-
game situations. That task is 
often left to junior guard Spike 
Albrecht, almost a full foot 
shorter than the 6-foot-10 Doyle.

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

inability to execute inbound plays 
has been an issue throughout 
the 
year, 
it 
was 
especially 

noticeable against Illinois and 
Egwu, as Albrecht and freshman 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman 
had 
substantial 

difficulty 
avoiding 
turnovers 

and even occasional five-second 
violations 
during 
Michigan’s 

late-game collapse.

Being forced to use smaller 

players on sideline inbounds 
plays wasn’t the only issue, 
Bielfeldt said, noting that youth 

and a simple lack of repetition has 
led to occasional confusion on set 
inbound play calls.

“We’re 
more 
working 
on 

general press-break,” Bielfeldt 
said. “I think in the past, we’ve 
had difficulties with the timing 
of our cuts and the spacing. You 
know, you get two guys in one 
area, and they don’t have to be 
guarded by as many guys, and it 
makes it easier on the defense.”

Even if the Wolverines can get 

their inbounding issues in check 
and handle the Fighting Illini in 
the backcourt, they have no easy 
task in front of them, especially 
with the resurgence of Illinois 
guard 
Rayvonte 
Rice. 
He’s 

averaging 17 points per game, but 
scored just four against Michigan 
on Feb. 12, his first game after 
returning from a broken left 
hand.

Sophomore guards Malcolm 

Hill and Kendrick Nunn also 
average 14.2 and 11.2 points per 
game, respectively, creating a 
triple-headed 
scoring 
threat 

that could give the Wolverines 
defensive fits.

Overtime blues

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

lacrosse team lost a heartbreaker 
in overtime to Virginia Tech 
in its first 
outdoor 
game 
of 

the season 
at Michigan Stadium.

Virginia Tech climbed out 

of a five-goal deficit to beat the 
Wolverines, 13-12.

Sophomore 
attacker 
Jess 

Angerman opened the scoring 
for the Wolverines on a nice 
pass from sophomore midfielder 
Anna Schueler. The Hokies (5-4) 
answered minutes later with an 
unassisted goal from the nation’s 
leading goal scorer, attacker 
Megan Will.

Michigan 
(3-3) 
pressured 

Virginia Tech early with an 
unassisted goal from sophomore 
midfielder 
Kim 
Coughlan, 

followed by free position goals 
from 
Shueler, 
sophomore 

attacker 
Tess 
Korten 
and 

sophomore midfielder Madeline 
Dion. 
Angerman 
added 
her 

second of the night to complete 
the Wolverines’ 5-0 scoring run.

“We got to a 6-1 lead at 

the beginning of the game,” 
Schueler said. “I think that’s 
something we need to learn 
from, is learning how to play 
with a lead. You have to take the 
positives from every single game 
we play.”

Virginia Tech followed up 

Michigan’s string of goals with 
a streak of its own, scoring six 
straight to end the first half, 
including two more from Will. 
The Hokies added a goal with 15 
seconds remaining in the half, 
taking a 7-6 lead.

In contrast to the streaky 

scoring of the first half, the 
second half was much more back 
and forth between the two teams. 
Unassisted goals from Coughlan 

and Dion put the Wolverines 
back in the lead in the beginning 
of the second half. After two 
more goals from Virginia Tech, 
Angerman completed her hat 
trick. 
However, 
the 
Hokies 

quickly added two more, putting 
Michigan down, 11-9.

The 
young 
Wolverines 

responded by scoring three 
straight goals, with Coughlan 
adding her second and Schueler 
netting her second and third for 
Michigan’s second hat trick of 
the night.

“They did a great job sliding 

the entire game, and I thought 
we did a good job adjusting to 
what their defense threw at us,” 
Schueler said. 

Up 12-11 with 3:31 left in the 

game, 
the 
Wolverines 
tried 

to run out the clock when a 
turnover followed by a cross-
checking yellow card for Korten 
gave the Hokies the ball with 52 
seconds remaining and a player 
advantage. Virginia Tech was 
able to take the opportunity and 
force overtime.

In 
the 
two 
three-minute 

overtime periods, both defenses 
succeeded 
in 
limiting 
their 

opponent’s shot opportunities. 
And as the clock wound down, it 
looked like the game would head 
to sudden death when the Hokies 
netted the final tally of the night 
with two seconds on the clock, 
ruining any hope Michigan had 
of improving its record to 4-2.

“You 
know, 
we’re 

inexperienced, 
that 
was 
a 

very experienced team,” said 
Michigan coach Jennifer Ulehla. 
“There are a lot of positives, but 
there are little mistakes that we 
made strategically that have to 
be learned. Unfortunately, they 
have to be learned in situations 
like this. We’re gonna break 
down the film, we’re gonna talk 
about every aspect of the game 
and learn from it and move 
forward.”

Compher regaining old form

The sophomore 

forward is starting 

to look like his 
freshman self

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan 
hockey 
coach 

Red Berenson said time after 
time this season that he liked 
how sophomore forward JT 
Compher was playing, and it 
would only be a matter of time 
before the goals started piling 
up for the sophomore forward.

Game after game, Berenson 

found himself referring to the 
same mantra: It’s only a matter 
of time. Prior to the Wisconsin 
series two weeks ago, and last 
weekend’s Penn State series, 
Compher had tallied just four 
goals through 26 games.

Though that would be fine for 

some players, Compher entered 
this 
season 
as 
Michigan’s 

reigning point leader — with 31 
last season — scoring 11 goals 
in 
his 
freshman 
campaign. 

Compher was expected to be 
one of the Wolverines’ top 
scoring options, but it didn’t 
appear that way.

However, in the Wolverines’ 

past four games, he registered 
seven goals and added an 
assist. Finally, Berenson could 
say something new about the 
talented sophomore.

“We 
thought 
JT 
would 

continue where he left off last 
year,” Berenson said. “I kind of 
forgot how good he was until he 
got it going again.

“… All of the sudden he’s kind 

of ‘Wow.’ He’s got that little 
step that maybe he was missing 
when things weren’t going for 
him. It’s nice to see the old JT.”

Compher’s 
teammates 

echoed their coach’s sentiment 
that Compher’s goals would 
come. 
But 
junior 
forward 

Andrew Copp tried to pinpoint 
what 
exactly 
jumpstarted 

Compher’s scoring barrage.

“A couple of empty-net goals 

kind of got him going,” Copp 
said.

But the junior added how 

important it is that Compher is 
picking up the team’s scoring 
load, 
especially 
when 
the 

nation’s top-ranked offense is 
starting to cool down.

Berenson 

and 
Compher’s 
teammates 
each 
noted 

that for the 
middle 
part 

of the season, 
the extremely 
competitive 
Compher 
might 
have 
been 

frustrated, 
even 
though 
he 

never showed it on the outside.

“He expects a lot of from 

himself,” Copp said. “I think 
he was frustrated through the 
middle part of the year because 
he wasn’t one of the leading 
scorers, and he expects himself 
to be a dominant player. This 
isn’t to say he wasn’t producing 

in other areas, though.

“I think he’s gotten a monkey 

off his back right now and has 
a lot of confidence right now, 
and that’s how he should always 
feel.”

Compher 

noted he might 
have 
been 

somewhat 
frustrated, 
but never to 
a 
magnitude 

where 
his 

game 
was 

being adversely 
affected.

He knew his 

goals 
would 

come and knew he needed to 
contribute in other areas if goals 
weren’t going to come his way. 
And that’s exactly what he did.

Compher headlined a strong 

penalty-killing unit, and his 
grit and competitive nature 
made the game tougher on his 
opponents.

“I kept my work ethic up; that 

never faltered,” Compher said. 
“I tried to just continue to keep 
confidence in my game, because 
I know that I can make plays 
and be an effective player. I just 
tried to stay within my game, 
and coach said to continue 
playing defense first and to do 
the rights things and it will fall 
in place.

“Right now it is, but it’s time 

to keep it going, though.”

For someone who is coming 

off two hat tricks in his last 
four games, Compher still isn’t 
satisfied. Put bluntly, Compher 
knows a hat trick doesn’t matter 
if his team ends up losing.

For now, Berenson is happy 

to have one of his best players 
turning it up a notch at this 
crucial juncture, with Michigan 
controlling its destiny to win 
a Big Ten championship this 
weekend.

“I think JT has gone from 

a good player to a great player 
over the last three weeks,” 
Berenson said.

JT Compher has scored seven goals in his last four games after struggling to find the net for much of the season.

“I kind of forgot 

how good he 

was until he got 
it going again.”

Stability behind 
plate very Sweet

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

Year after year, Michigan 

softball coach Carol Hutchins 
has made a habit of swapping 
players in and out of the starting 
lineup. But there is one position 
that has always been set.

Since 
her 
freshman 
year, 

Lauren Sweet has been the 
Wolverines’ go-to catcher. Sweet, 
now a senior, is just seven games 
shy of her 200th start.

When she’s not behind the 

plate, Sweet is one of the team’s 
strongest power hitters. When 
she is behind the plate, she’s 
the solid, reliable catcher that 
Michigan needs. Since 2012, the 
starting lineup has seen pitchers, 
infielders and outfielders come 
and go, but at catcher, it has 
always been Sweet.

A vocal leader both on and 

off the field, it didn’t take long 
for Sweet to earn Hutchins’ 
approval. In 2012, in just her 
second 
career 
game, 
Sweet 

belted a home run against then-
No. 22 LSU. Along with her 
deadly arm, her bat has secured 
her starting spot.

And this season has shown 

why she’s maintained it. Through 
25 games this season, Sweet has 
stacked up six home runs, 27 RBI, 
a .333 batting average and a .682 
slugging percentage.

On defense, Sweet has caught 

nearly half of opponents trying 
to steal bases, a statistic that 
has been on the rise since her 
freshman season. The numbers 
speak for themselves, but her 
coach and teammates all attested 
to the fact that some of Sweet’s 
greatest contributions come from 
her experience.

“She’s caught four years behind 

the plate, so her experience is 
instinctive,” Hutchins said. “She 
has a gun for an arm with such 
a quick release, but she’s also a 
calming force for the pitchers 
and the coaches. She keeps things 
under control; never gets too 
high, never too low. Overall, she’s 

a pretty even-keel kid.”

Sweet has embraced this role, 

especially in keeping a good 
relationship and understanding 
with pitchers. Whenever one of 
the pitchers is struggling in the 
circle, Sweet will get up to talk to 
her. But not all the conversations 
are serious.

“A lot of the times it’s just to 

give them time to relax,” Sweet 
said. “Sometimes it’s serious, 
sometimes it’s just to make 
them laugh. As a pitcher, you 
are going and going, and say you 
just walked somebody, you don’t 
have a second to forget about 
that one and move on. In those 
situations, I go out there and 
tell them to breathe and take a 
second.”

Added 
sophomore 
pitcher 

Megan Betsa: “Sweet always 
knows the perfect thing to say. 
She knows when you need to be 
talked to nicely and she knows 
when you need to be picked up. 
That’s a really good quality to 
have as a catcher.”

The 
relationship 
she 
has 

with the pitching staff grows 
stronger each year. For senior 
lefthander Haylie Wagner, the 
connection began before coming 
to Michigan.

“I’ve known her even longer 

than college and she’s just 
improved so much,” Wagner 
said. “Before, she was always 
very calm, not caught up and 
just had fun with it. Now, she 
still is having fun, but I think 
she’s even more determined on 
getting better and better. She’s 
a lot more vocal and able to fix 
things on the spot. Throughout 
the years, she’s really learned to 
trust herself and trust the whole 
team.”

Sweet knows the starting 

spot belongs to her, but she’s 
still not content. One day a week, 
she arrives late to practice due 
to class, so she stays an hour 
afterwards to hit. While some 
go-to starters might be content 
with their game, Sweet is putting 
in the extra work.

There’s no handle? There’s no handle. How the 
hell do I get inside? I’m supposed to be interviewing 
the talent buyer of The Blind Pig at 6 p.m. and it is 6:03 
and there’s no handle on the door to get in. I feverishly 
check my e-mail to avoid being later than the three minutes 
I’ve already lost. “I’ll meet you in the 8 Ball.” I trudge down 
the gravel hill to the graffitied door of the 8 Ball, The Blind 
Pig’s basement bar, to meet Jason Berry.

I step into the 8 Ball Saloon, multi-colored Christmas lights 
wrap around ceiling pipes, and the dimly lit room is filled with 
dart boards and pool tables. Two men at the bar alternate be-
tween popcorn and beer, their eyes fixated on Alaskan Troopers 
busting a coke house on a TV. My phone says it’s 6:20 when Berry 
walks into the saloon. He is clearly busy, fumbling papers in his 
hands as he goes to shake mine.

“Can you ride with me to the post office?” he 
asks. “I’ve got a few errands to run.”

Berry has worked at The Blind Pig as talent buyer for 
more than 17 years and is an essential part of the 
smooth running machine that is Ann Arbor’s 
premier music venue. The Pig puts on more 
than 200 shows per year, a mixture of live 
bands and DJs, with an average ticket price of 
$15. Berry chalks up his 17-year tenure to the 
support of his boss, Blind Pig owner 
Betty Goffett.

“Buyers don’t last more than 
two years on average. 
They’re under tremen-
dous pressure, from 
the community, from 
the ownership,” 
Berry said. “So, if 
the owner doesn’t 
have your back 
or is some sort 
of flake, then 
you’re go-
ing to burn 
through 
buyers. The 
owners 
have got to 
have your 
back. I’ve 
been mega 
lucky that 
I’ve had 
Betty.”

Goffett and 
her late 
husband 
came to 
own the Pig 
in 1981. Roy 
Goffett grew 
up in Liver-
pool, England, 
witnessing The 
Beatles gain trac-
tion in the Cavern 
Club. Owning a 
music club was 
his dream. After he 
made a small fortune 
in the steel industry, 
his wife, who also 
came up from money, 
bought him the Blind Pig 
as a gift. Roy passed away 
in 2001.

The Blind Pig’s history 
can be seen in two dis-
tinct phases: pre-Goffett 
and post-Goffett. Prior 
to the Goffetts’ ownership, 
the Pig was a much smaller, 
strictly blues club.

“They were the ones who said, ‘Yeah, 
we aren’t just going to do blues. We’re 
going to do everything, so that’s when 
The Blind Pig became what it is today,” Berry said. “No one 
remembers the old Blind Pig except the old-school hippies. 
That was all Betty.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

While the current owner made 

the room what it is today, the Blind 
Pig has always been wildly success-
ful. Previous owners sold the Pig 
not out of financial concern, but out 
of diverging aspirations. The first 
was big into espresso machines 
and left Ann Arbor to pursue that 
business; the next started Blind 
Pig Records with recording artists 
who were booked at the time. Soon 
after, that venture moved to San 
Francisco, allowing Betty to pur-
chase the Pig for Roy.

“If you talk to anyone who knew 

the Pig back in the day when it was 
a blues bar, everyone will say it was 
fucking packed every night. This 
was where you bought all your 
coke, so that didn’t hurt. It wasn’t 
like the Pig was ever not profitable, 
it was just that the owners were off 
to different shit and they wanted 
to sell. The Pig has always been 
blessed like that,” Berry said.

The Pig has had continuous suc-

cess over the past 40-plus years, 
though that doesn’t mean it hasn’t 
faced a few challenges. Berry 
recounts the drop in sales fol-
lowing September 2001. He said 
if a club was doing live bands and 
guaranteeing funds to bring them 
in and business was cut in half due 
to public fear, it ran a serious risk of 
going out of business. Quick on his 
feet, he booked solely local bands 
for the remainder of the 2001-2002 
academic year.

“For the first time we saw 

something affect the bar busi-
ness because people drink when 
they’re up and they drink when 

they’re down, so we are recession 
proof. So when that happened and 
people were afraid to go out, all of 
our numbers were just cut in half,” 
Berry said. “The rest of that school 
year there was just a pittance of 
tours. People were like, ‘What the 
fuck, man? Put some real fuck-
ing shows in there.’ I had to listen 
to that for a while. Then we got to 
summer …” He mimes pushing a 
throttle forward, “and we are so 
badass and we were just back.”

Aside 
from 
the 
post-9/11 

slump, Berry chalks up the Pig’s 
financial stability to owner Betty 
Goffett. At age 87, she is frugal-
minded and does not live beyond 
her means. Her financial outlook 
works to keep the Blind Pig ral-
lying through tough economic 
times.

“Honestly, she does not fuck 

around. When a beer cooler goes 
down, she replaces it. She doesn’t 
play with money. It’s really bor-
ing actually, but it’s through her 
leadership that we haven’t strug-
gled.”

Frugality aside, the Pig is not 

afraid to spend for what it needs. 
By now we are done at the post 
office, and are heading back to 
the 8 Ball. Berry begins telling 
one of his favorite stories about 
Betty. Last month, New York DJ 
and producer Kap Slap head-
lined the Blind Pig, but they did 
not have turntables compatible 
with Kap Slap’s USB hub. Two 
hours before show time the staff 
was looking for CDJ 2000s, the 
newest, 
top-of-the-line 
turn-

tables, but no one had them 
because they’re so expensive. 
Finally a friend of Berry called 
and said Guitar Center in Canton 
had them and you could return 
products the next day. Without 
the 2000s, the show would have 
to be cancelled and money would 
have been returned to over 200 
ticketholders.

“Without 
missing 
a 
beat 

(Betty) was like, ‘OK, cool. Let’s 
go.’ She calls ahead and has them 
stay open for her to make this 
purchase. She bought $7,500 
turntables to return them once 
their check cleared, so they 

didn’t think we were playing 
them,” Berry said. “There’s no 
owner like her. That’s Betty. 
She’s progressive and passion-
ate about groups, people and the 
quality of the experience.”

That experience starts with 

the shows’ lineups. Berry brings 
in a mix of local talent and 
national tours to Ann Arbor, and 
between the wealth of local tal-
ents and the national recognition 

of The Blind Pig as one of the 
best college-town clubs. Local 
bands are begging for shows, and 
agents send national acts to the 
Pig as a proving ground.

“Pound for pound, in terms of 

sound quality, experience of the 
patron and consistency of what’s 
happening there, we are often 
told we are one of the best (clubs) 
for our little size,” Berry said. 
“The reality is in the Detroit 
market we are the smallest of the 
clubs we compete with. We are 
competing with The Crofoot, St. 
Andrews and the Magic Stick. 
Every one of these rooms is big-
ger than us, so our advantage is 
that we are the college town.”

Musicians come to Ann Arbor to 

tap into the college-student demo-
graphic. The booking process dif-
fers slightly between local bands 

and national tours. Local bands 
either e-mail the Pig looking to play 
a lineup, or Berry is aware of a band 
through word of mouth and looks 
into them before offering them a 
spot. They start on a Wednesday or 
Thursday, and once they get a fol-
lowing they’ll move to a weekend.

For national acts, agents offer a 

night to Berry, and, if available, he 
gives them first hold, meaning that 
if no one is currently booked that 

night, they get first opportunity. He 
then sends in an offer, most times 
a flat rate plus a percentage if prof-
its hit a certain mark. Agents may 
accept immediately or negotiate 
for more. After the show is booked, 
announced and on-sale production 
is taken over by the staff, the gen-
eral manager or manager on duty 
pays the band, and Berry is already 
looking for the next show.

“It’s really smooth. Every club 

has the same procedure, but 
every club has its own tweak on 
it. The Magic Stick’s process has 
far many more people involved 
in it than we do, but that has to 
do with their size,” Berry said. 
“Coming from The Blind Pig 
and seeing that, it gives a nice 
perspective on how well the Pig 
is actually doing what they’re 
doing.”

While the playing field is 

somewhat leveled by the Pig’s 
status as a college-town club, 
they also have money on their 
side due to the affluence of the 
Michigan student body and Ann 
Arbor residents, so they are able 
to spend a lot to bring in acts the 
community wants to see.

Berry recounted how they 

began to shell out for big shows. 
Lee Berry, then-Blind Pig talent 
buyer who is now chief devel-
opment officer at the Michigan 
Theater, and then-newly hired 
Jason Berry began hosting dance 
nights featuring international 
DJs. Back in 1998-99, flying DJs 
in from Europe was a revolution-
ary idea. He recounts that a club 
on Main Street would play ghet-
totech every Wednesday, but 
only feature Ann Arbor DJs.

“We were like, ‘Fuck that,’” he 

said. “We spent money, but it was 
because Ann Arbor. We could do 
that and charge 25 bucks to get 
in, which would have been ludi-
crous, but because of the affluent 
student body, we could just go for 
it. And now it’s the norm. People 
would be surprised if that wasn’t 
happening now.

“The Pig is fucking great. As a 

talent buyer I can just sit there. It’s 
like painting.” He motions mov-
ing a paintbrush across a canvas. 
“The club is so solid, and it has a 
magnificent owner who rolls with 
the punches and understands the 
nature of the live music industry.”

The Blind Pig’s backlog of 

shows is impressive. Jason Berry 
has brought in John Mayer, The 
White Stripes and Wiz Khalifa’s 
first show in Michigan. Prior to 
that, Lee Berry brought in Pearl 
Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Dave 
Matthews Band and Nirvana, who 
famously stated the Blind Pig as 
their favorite venue to play in an 
MTV interview.

Nirvana’s legendary show took 

place in 1990 on its Bleach Tour. 
The tour was receiving lackluster 
response until the Monday before 
they were set to play; Soundgar-
den 
frontman, 
Chris 
Cornell, 

told a sold-out Blind Pig crowd to 
come back next week for Nirvana. 

Between that shoutout and some 
momentum built from opening for 
Tap and Screaming Trees, Nirvana 
took the stage to a sold-out crowd 
instead of the expected half-empty 
venue.

After the show, Nirvana didn’t 

have a place to stay, so the band 
crashed the Prism Productions 
offices on Fourth Street. Lee 
Berry walked into his office the 
next morning only to step over 
Krist Novoselic’s legs and see Kurt 
Cobain passed out on his sofa and 
in his plush office chair.

“I booked a bunch of great shit 

for my little 17-year tenure, but Lee 
booked all that famous shit,” Berry 
said. “But he’s got Dave Matthews 
and Godsmack. He is the Don 
Dada.” (Urban Dictionary: “A com-
bination of Don and Dada. Meaning 
the top pimp, the biggest player and 
even one step above mack daddy.”) 
“He booked everything the Pig is 
really famous for, including every 
damn time Nirvana played. He is 
the man.”

Step one: buy your husband 

a blues club. Step two: host all 
types of bands. Step three: profit. 
It was the perfect storm that has 
led to the local goldmine called 
The Blind Pig. It feeds off the 
vibrancy of Ann Arbor and the 
affluence of its inhabitants to put 
on legendary music shows.

“The point of it all is to sell 

beer, and we are just very good 
at selling it the way we sell it. 
It could be simpler, but that’s 
what the 8 Ball is for,” he said. 
“That’s just a beer and shot bar 
and the Pig is some complicated 
bells and whistles to sell a glass 
of beer. It all just works really 
well.”

Abraham.In.Motion 
dances social justice

By GILLIAN JAKAB

Daily Arts Writer

What does it mean to dance 

social justice? This question 
occupied the hour-and-a-half 
“night 
school” 
session 
this 

past Monday led by Prof. Clare 
Croft with choreographer Kyle 
Abraham as part of Abraham.
In.Motion’s weeklong residency 
in Ann Arbor, culminating in its 
University Musical Society debut 
of The Watershed on Friday and 
When the Wolves Came In on 
Saturday.

Abraham 
doesn’t 
dance 

around the issues of race and 
identity that he has set out to 
explore with these works, but 
rather charts a collision course 
with them in multi-media form. 
With the layers of choreography, 
music, visual projections and 
theatrical elements of drag, the 
mind and body are roused into 
perpetual motion as Abraham 
propels us through the history of 
civil rights to confront our con-
temporary social climate.

Abraham visited Ann Arbor 

last spring to do some workshops 
including a “You Can Dance” 
community 
program 
at 
the 

YMCA, but this is the first time 
we get to see Abraham.In.Motion 
perform. The Pittsburgh-born 
choreographer has been praised 
for his refreshing and eclectic 
post-modern style — a blend of 
his immersion in hip-hop and 
rave cultures and his classical 
training in music, visual art and 
dance. After studying modern 
dance 
at 
SUNY 
Purchase 

and 
NYU 
Tisch, 
Abraham 

began dancing professionally 
and founded his company in 
2006. The dance world has 
certainly noticed his talent; 
Abraham has been invited to 
work 
with 
long-established 

choreographers such as David 
Dorfman and Bill T. Jones, and 
was commissioned to create a 
piece for Alvin Ailey American 
Dance in 2012. Recognition and 
funding is essential to power 
a choreographer’s work and 
a MacArthur Fellowship in 

2013 and residency with New 
York Live Arts from 2012-2014, 
among 
other 
awards, 
have 

been key planks in Abraham’s 
launching pad.

Abraham comes to UMS with 

nine dancers from his company. 
One of them, Matthew Baker, is 
a native of Ann Arbor who went 
to Western Michigan University 
and grew up seeing shows at the 
Power Center and Hill Auditori-
um. Baker remembers being awed 
as a 13 year-old dance student see-
ing Baryshnikov perform solos on 
the stage of the Power Center. The 
realization that he will take the 
same stage this weekend is deeply 
meaningful to Baker.

“UMS, and the Power Center 

and all that has been a part of my 
life and my family’s life — it’ll be 
great to go back,” Baker said. “The 
programming is always really 
wonderful. I’m excited that our 
company is going to become part 
of that.”

This 
weekend, 
Abraham.

In.Motion is performing the two 
pieces created over Abraham’s 
tenure as resident artist with New 
York Live Arts, both of which pre-
miered in September 2014. The 
pieces correspond to the 100th 
anniversary of the Emancipation 
Proclamation and the 20th anni-
versary of the end of Apartheid 
in South Africa. Abraham drew 
inspiration from the 1960 Max 

Roach album We Insist! which, 
in Saturday’s program, When the 
Wolves Came In, is reinterpreted 
by the Robert Glasper Trio. Fri-
day’s program, The Watershed, 
is an evening-length piece that 
mixes imagery from the Emanci-
pation Proclamation period, the 
American civil rights movement in 
the 1960s and contemporary race 
relations.

“(The Watershed is) drawing 

some then-and-now comparisons 
and … (puts) questions out in the 
air and in people’s minds,” Baker 
said. “It’s really interesting the 
way that he uses dance and theat-
rical elements to do that — to start 
a conversation.”

This was a collaborative pro-

cess for Abraham, working with 
Glasper on musical interpreta-
tion of the Max Roach album 
and visual artist Glenn Ligon to 
curate film projections and over-
all set design to complement the 
live art. Not only was the process 
collaborative across artistic dis-
ciplines, but the choreography 
itself emerged from conversations 
with, and contributions from, the 
dancers. Baker reflected on the 
ways in which race is represented 
and performed in the pieces:

“A lot of the presentations of 

race, the race of a certain dancer 
and the relationships (among 
them) I think sometimes are very 
intentional to draw attention to 

TRAILER REVIEW

If Wes Anderson had a 

twin brother it would be Noah 
Baumbach. Many of Baumbach’s 
films 
– 

especially 
“The 
Squid 

and 
the 

Whale” 
and 

“Frances 
Ha” – exude 
the 
same 

cleverness, 
tactfulness 
and cinematic poise. In fact, 
Baumbach and Anderson have 
co-written two movies together, 
and have undoubtedly attended 
many of the same dinner parties 
(which 
is 
more 
important 

anyway). They are storytellers of 
the same stylistic vein: singular, 
insightful, 
memorable. 
With 

“While We’re Young,” however, 
Baumbach seems to be taking 
a more personal turn, one that 
promises to grapple with the 
struggles and challenges of aging 
in a world that’s increasingly 
dependent on young people.

Ben Stiller (“Night at the 

Museum”) and Naomi Watts 
(“Birdman”) star as a married 
middle-aged couple who become 
enthralled with the lifestyle 
and energy of a younger couple 
they counter. Together the two 

couples embark on a series of 
adventures, including a yoga-like 
class in which each participant 
consumes a mysterious drink, 
hallucinates and vomits their 
“demons” out from their system. 
If you’ve ever wanted to see Ben 
Stiller in a silly hipster context, 
this is your chance.

In addition to the strange and 

somewhat whimsical situations 
the couples volunteer themselves 
for, a broader and more serious 
commentary underlies the film. 
“While We’re Young” is about the 
cultural age gap and the strains 
it puts on intergenerational 
communication. It’s evident that, 
although each couple admires 
the other for certain qualities or 

habits, they all find fault in their 
relationships. In this way, the 
film is about learning to accept 
these marital faults instead of 
trying to change or ignore them. 
The title obviously implies a 
“well, it’s too late” sentiment, 
but it does nothing in the way 
of condescending to such an 
attitude. This will be a smart, 
well-written comedy about the 
pains and pleasures of age, and 
about the ways in which we all 
can come to fall in love with 
personal flaws.

Plus, James Murphy of LCD 

Soundsystem is orchestrating 
the film’s music. Need there be 
more reason to go and see it?

CONCERT REVIEW

That’s not how you spell YMCA.

a certain scene or movement, but 
I think a lot of the time they’re 
kind of up in the air to allow (an) 
audience 
(member’s) 
personal 

backgrounds or what (he or she) is 
interpreting in the piece to inform 
what they’re seeing,” Baker said. 
“I also think a lot of stuff is made 
initially qualitatively based on the 
blending of two dancer’s different 
styles, and sometimes race or iden-
tity or meaning fit in, or layer in, 
where it might make sense, or not 
make sense, or draw an interesting 
parallel. I think sometimes those 
things are crafted and sometimes 
they come up organically just as 
the movement does.”

The workshops and events sur-

rounding the performances — the 
night school sessions, brunch 
download and post-show Q&As 
following this weekend’s perfor-
mances — are of equal importance 
and serve as a forum to digest the 
heavy material.

“It’s really interesting to hear 

back from the communities and 
I think it’s important to Kyle, and 

I’ve seen a number of times, to let 
the communities hear each other,” 
Baker said. “I’ve actually sat in 
many of the small conversations 
where one person will (say) ‘the 
dance is so abstract’ and I think a 
lot of times people don’t know how 
to watch it, so when they’re forced 
to talk about it they come up with 
all these different perspectives 
and I think that revealing some-
thing about themselves helps them 
learn something about their com-
munities and each other and how 
to change or develop.”

Although not originally con-

ceived as a response to the recent 
tensions in race relations, The 
Watershed and When the Wolves 
Came In could not be more timely 
in the wake of the recent awak-
enings of the nation’s awareness 
around the killings of Michael 
Brown and Eric Garner last year.

“I think the pieces and the work 

(as a whole) raise a lot of questions 
for people, and starting a conversa-
tion can be a catalyst for change or 
for organizing … But I also think 

art and artists have a way of com-
municating certain things about 
the times that we live in because 
they are making art in that time. 
I think that Kyle’s voice has devel-
oped and is really being heard 
right now — people are taking note 
and heeding interest because he 
has a lot to say, and he says it in a 
really interesting way through 
movement,” Baker said.

Kyle Abraham has been called 

“the man of the moment” and 
“darling of the dance world” by 
Dance Magazine He is a rising 
star in the dance and performance 
world — one to watch in the years 
to come. Not only can we start by 
watching him this weekend at the 
Power Center, but we can engage 
in his conversation.

“As dance works,” Abraham 

writes in his Director’s Note, “The 
Watershed and its companion 
piece, When the Wolves Came In 
were created to live in a skin well 
aware of the cyclical hardships of 
our history and the very present 
fear of an unknowable future.”

Dance Mix a medley 
of styles and genres

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

In 2001, six University dance 

groups — FunKtion, EnCore, 
RhythM Tap Ensemble, Impact, 
Indigo and Element 1 — performed 
a show together, fusing tap, lyrical 
and hip hop genres together on one 
stage. And the next year, it hap-
pened again. And again and again. 
This year, Dance Mix celebrates its 
15th anniversary.

Dance Mix began partly to give 

performers a venue. It requires a 
great deal of planning and finan-
cial resources to put on an indi-
vidual show, which can prove a 
daunting hurdle, especially for 
young groups.

But more than that, Dance Mix 

sought to showcase the dizzying 
variety of dance at the University. 
What were originally six groups 
flourished into a broad-reaching 
collaboration between upwards of 
a dozen dance and musical groups 
on campus. The five core groups, 
still active since that first perfor-
mance, plan and perform in Dance 
Mix annually. The rest of the line-
up consists of six or seven rotating 
guest groups.

“We try to find a good balance of 

entertainment and diversity,” said 
Meredith Njus, an LSA senior and 
member of this year’s 13-person 
organizing team.

For the performers, Dance Mix 

fosters a tight-knit and lively dance 
community. Put 200 people who 
are fiercely passionate about the 
same thing on one stage, and it’s 
only inevitable that they bond.

“I didn’t really start dancing 

until I came to college. I grew up 
mostly with music and singing,” 
LSA senior Jay Park said. “So 
what dance means to me is just an 
entirely new opportunity. It really 
encompasses my entire college 
experience down to one medium 
of expression. Dance to me means 
community, it means family.”

In the month leading up to the 

show, groups take to Mason Hall’s 
Posting Wall and practice for an 
average of six hours a day, increas-
ing to upwards of 12 as the per-
formance draws closer. The time 
commitment may seem stressful, 
but preparing for a show is one of 
the fundamental rites of being a 
dancer.

“You’re forced to be there, but 

you’re with such a great group of 
people who love the same things 

as you do that it’s really such an 
unforgettable experience,” Park 
said. “And this is something that 
I’ll take with me for the rest of my 
life and I’ll look back on so affec-
tionately.”

That same adrenaline becomes 

a shared experience among those 
in the performance, widening 
the niche, genre-based dance 
networks and connecting the 
overall dance community at the 
University.

“As soon as you have a Dance 

Mix semester and you go through 
a Dance Mix, you start seeing all 
of the groups and you’re all back-
stage, and you’re all amped about 
the show, and I think that you 
start to get to know everyone in 
the other groups,” Njus said. “So 
you start seeing them at the Post-
ing Wall or you start seeing them 
around campus and you’ll see peo-
ple wearing Dance Mix shirts and 
you’re like, ‘Oh hey!’ ”

The sense of camaraderie in 

Dance Mix is what draws in so 
many guest performing groups 
to apply each year. It takes the 
passion that the dancers have for 
their individual dance groups 
and directs it outwards, making 
the show a sort of meeting of the 
minds.

Business senior Suhind Kodali, 

a captain of Michigan Izzat dance 
team, performed at Dance Mix 
last year and will do so again in 
the upcoming show. His team 
mainly performs at competitions, 
so Dance Mix offers a chance to 
showcase their talents to their 
peers.

“For us, it’s like, “Oh wow, look 

at all these dance groups on cam-
pus and we can show them our 
style and they can show us theirs,’ 
” Kodali said.

The enthusiasm for dance — in 

all its forms — is evident in the 
audience. The groups perform-
ing in the show don’t just do it for 
themselves; they eagerly support 
whoever commands the stage.

“It’s just the energy, that’s what 

we like best,” Kodali said.

Which is why after 15 years, the 

core team still devotes so much 
time to keeping Dance Mix alive. 
Following the show’s unified spir-
it, two to four members from each 
of the original core dance groups 
also come together to form the 
core organizing team.

“It’s 
a 
very 
collaborative 

and democratic process,” Park 

explains.

The core team starts the plan-

ning process as early as the fall 
semester each year, meeting twice 
a month for preliminary brain-
storming. Winter semester brings 
the bulk of the work, and the core 
team must buckle down to run 
auditions, figure out timing, make 
up themes, make T-shirts and set 
up the venue. The show is entirely 
student-produced, carried on the 
backs of the 13 dedicated core team 
members.

Having not only performed, 

but been members of the core 
team throughout their four years 
at Michigan, Njus and Park wit-
nessed Dance Mix’s evolution to 
keep up with the rapidly changing, 
technology-ridden culture, espe-
cially through social media.

“(Social media is) a big way we 

can reach out to a lot of people, 
reach out to our alumni, and just 
get people excited about the show 
very early on this semester or even 
early on in the year,” Njus said. 
“Before, it’s been, ‘Your friends 
come or whatever,’ but now we 
have alumni that are flying in from 
all over the country; all over the 
world. And I think that was always 
a thing, but now we have an easier 
way of reaching out to them and 
being like, ‘Guys, it’s Dance Mix 
season again. Come back!’”

Dance Mix has also benefitted 

from the growing popularity of 
performing arts in media. Reality 
shows like “So You Think You Can 
Dance” and “America’s Best Dance 
Crew” have driven a wider appre-
ciation for dance. More people 
unaffiliated with dance are willing 
and interested to learn more about 
it.

“We’ve been able to use that and 

connect it with the integrity of our 
show which has stayed the same,” 
Park said.

He stressed that ultimately, 

while Dance Mix has blossomed 
into a larger event over the past 15 
years, it still retains the original 
roots behind its inception.

“This is all fun, this is some-

thing that a lot of dance groups 
look forward to all year. You’ll see 
us practicing in the Posting Wall 
for hours, hours, in the weeks lead-
ing up to the actual performance. 
And I think that’s just what we 
want to keep. We want a very sim-
ple message, a simple approach: 
the unification of dancers and hav-
ing fun with it all.”

SINGLE REVIEW

The word “evolution” is 

thrown around a lot when 
critics yak about an artist’s 
career. Is the band “naturally 
progress-
ing?” 
Are 

they 
con-

sistently 
improving 
from album 
to album and 
transforming 
their sound?

It 
seems 

to be coded in our DNA: in 
order for an artist to remain 
relevant, the aforementioned 
changes must take place — 
if not to appease the critics 
than to keep the artists’ fans 
shocked and interested (and 
the band from getting bored). 
It’s fun to hear new stuff, but 
too much change is a turn-
off for even the most pious 
groupie.

Enter Mumford & Sons, 

that group of British lads 
with 
the 
signature 
fast-

paced, folky banjo sound. 
They built their reputation 
on throwing it back and strip-
ping it down — no machinery 
required. Their latest release, 

“Believe,” sheds all Mum-
fordian quirks; it’s a slow-ish, 
techno-infused fantasy bal-
lad a la “Fix You” by Coldplay. 
It starts out eerie, weirdly 
synth-y and blossoms into 
an electrically charged cry 
for help. Lead singer Marcus 
Mumford’s smoky vocals are 
the only thing connecting the 
old to the new, and he sounds 
handsome as always.

It’s interesting, futuristic 

and melancholy; Snow Patrol 
and all the other I’m-a-vul-
nerable-man pop-rock groups 
would be proud. Mumford 

& Sons, however, shouldn’t 
be as thrilled — sure, this 
new schtick is catchy as hell, 
catered to pop radio and all 
its listeners looking for a bit 
of vanilla passion during 
their morning commute. But 
it’s been done before. We hear 
it on the radio all the time. Is 
the band truly “progressing” 
if they’re walking the exact 
same path as so many others: 
a mediocre, dead-end street 
of pseudo-rock (think: Life-
house) melodies? Not exactly.

Bring the banjos back.

STYLE RECAP

When Carol Lim and Hum-

berto Leon joined KENZO in 
2011 as Creative Directors, they 
sought to fuse their revolu-
tionary flavor with the house’s 
heritage. That isn’t to say the 
original label, started in 1970 by 
Kenzo Takada, didn’t have the 
spunk and color for which Lim 
and Leon have become known. 
It did — in fact, it toyed with 
stripes, brights, loudness, all of 
it. The new CDs have expand-
ed KENZO’s scope, at once in 
sophistication 
and 
pattern-

making. There’s a lot going on 
here, which is likely the result of 
the duo’s creative synergy over 
solitude.

If Rick Owens centered his 

pieces on shoulders, KENZO 
draped in particular from the 
neck up. A navy knit hoodie that 
could double as a turtleneck for 
an entire head obscures an elec-

tric blue cap and cuts diagonally 
through the torso. The muted 
hoodie gets louder with a green-
yellow tribal printed maxi cape 
that barely hits the floor. Base-
colored fishtail anorak jackets 
float atop schizophrenic striped 
trousers, as a matching rolled 
scarf keeps the face front and 
center invariably.

There are doubtless nods 

to the serenity of nature, here, 
with its hearty greenish hues, 
but never deviating too distant-
ly from its around-town urban 
wearability. Maroon suits with 
a mild sheen and snow-white 
shearling coats with misplaced 
oversized epaulettes feed into 
its more urban, spontaneous 
history.

Dusty old songwriters 

still relevant

L

ast week I was listen-
ing to Van Morrison’s 
“Cyprus Avenue” — 

the live version, one I absolute-
ly love and have written about 
before, and 
I think to 
myself, This 
song is life-
changingly 
great, but 
the one thing 
that’s miss-
ing is the 
harpsichord 
that’s in the 
studio ver-
sion of this track. And I keep 
thinking about that for the rest 
of the song: what if we also had 
the harpsichord in there? But 
then another voice barges into 
my head and tells me, Adam, 
this is a 45-year-old song about 
a street in Belfast you’ve never 
been to. You wouldn’t even have 
heard of if it weren’t for this 
singer. How is this relevant to 
you? Why are you spending so 
much time on this? What does 
the presence (or lack thereof) 
of a harpsichord possibly mat-
ter to you, an American teen-
ager whose parents couldn’t 
even walk when this song was 
released?

I’m on a kick where I’m 

listening to tons and tons of 
singer-songwriters 
from 
a 

very specific era — your Joni 
Mitchells, your Paul Simons, 
Van the Man, even a little Bob 
Dylan — and I keep thinking 
to myself why is this relevant? 
I’ve never felt the need to 
justify what I listen to, but 
with 
this 
brand 
of 
music 

that’s very quiet, very white, 
seemingly pretty detached from 
the modern world, I’m really 
questioning why I can’t stay 
away from it, why I should be 
returning again and again to 
these old songwriters instead of 
searching for the next big thing.

You 
see, 
the 
answer 
to 

the 
question 
of 
relevancy 

for almost all other kinds of 
music is obvious. Many years 
ago, Public Enemy’s Chuck 
D called hip hop “the CNN 
of the streets,” and while I 
don’t think there were any rap 
songs about missing airplanes 
last year, the sentiment still 
stands: hip hop is still where 
minority experiences are most 
visible 
and 
understandable 

to many Americans. Hip hop 
is where a young, oftentimes 

Black person — someone whose 
voice is far too often silenced 
by the mainstream — can step 
into the spotlight and amplify 
his or her voice for all to hear. 
Considering 
Ferguson, 
Eric 

Garner and disproportionate 
poverty as well as centuries 
of racial discrimination and 
cruelty 
towards 
minorities, 

it’s probably America’s most 
relevant genre (more on this 
next column, after Kendrick’s 
new album drops).

But there’s room for other 

types of music, too. Punk grew 
out of the disenfranchisement 
of the British working class, 
and still today functions as a 
space where rebellion, anger 
and 
protest 
can 
run 
wild 

and untethered (think Pussy 
Riot). 
Jazz, 
once 
dominant 

and 
controversial, 
still 

exists today as a magnet for 
some of our most talented 
musicians; hearing them play 
is as impossibly breathtaking as 
watching an Olympic gymnast 
nail 
every 
element 
of 
her 

routine. Beyoncé and Taylor 
Swift, meanwhile, have both 
this past year reinforced what 
we already knew very well: 
pop music is the simplest, and 
possibly the best, way to unite 
everyone 
you 
know. 
Even 

rock music, lately the most 
conservative of genres, has for 
decades brought together folks 
of different races, broken down 
gender norms and served as an 
inspiration to suburban kids 
that they, too, can form a band 
with their friends, write a song 
and hit it big.

So 
what 
is 
this 
singer-

songwriter stuff good for? It’s 
old, it doesn’t change the world or 
bring millions of people together, it 
doesn’t give a voice to the unheard 
and, though oftentimes beautiful, 
the 
instrumentation 
typically 

isn’t particularly virtuosic. What 
value does it have? What purpose 
does it serve?

I think a lot about music as a 

social experience, a force that 
connects us and allows us to 
be in each other’s’ company, 
sharing 
in 
the 
pleasurable 

sounds we hear. What I and 
many others don’t think about 
as much, it seems, is music in 
isolation, music that we listen to 
with nobody else around, with 
no distractions other than our 
own thoughts.

I’ve been thinking, too, about 

the times Joni Mitchell and Bob 
Dylan and Nick Drake were 
living in — the late ’60s into 
the ’70s. Back then, when you 
were alone late at night, you 
truly were alone. You couldn’t 
fall down a YouTube rabbit hole 
of old Steve Yzerman goals, 
or check Twitter to see what 
people in other time zones 
were up to, or even consume 
any media that you personally 

didn’t own a physical copy of.

That sounds so different 

from the world I live in. But 
then I picture where I’m at and 
what I’m doing when I listen to 
these great singer-songwriters. 
When 
I 
was 
listening 
to 

“Cyprus Avenue,” my house was 
dark, I had finished everything 
I had needed to do for the day, 
and was just calming down 
before going to bed. I listened 
to all of Joni Mitchell’s Blue the 
last time I had to shovel snow. 
Nick Drake and even the more 
contemporary 
Elliott 
Smith 

are perfect when I’m writing. 
And even with I’m with people 
and listening to these types of 
artists, it’s never more than one 
or two close friends, and we’re 
always lost in thought or deep 
in conversation with each other. 
Even though I live in a world 
where I’m constantly plugged 
into my phone and the Internet, 
when I find the time to turn all 
that off, Joni Mitchell and Van 
Morrison and Nick Drake are 
there to provide perfect music 
for me. It’s music to explore the 
mind to.

So why does it matter if Van 

Morrison 
is 
accompanied 
by 

a harpsichord or not? I don’t 
want to take anything away 
from contemporary artists, and 
I certainly don’t think I should 
spend all my energy parsing the 
past instead of looking to the new, 
relevant music of the future, but 
when I hear Bob Dylan’s half-
detached sarcasm, Joni Mitchell’s 
hopeful longing, Nick Drake’s deep 
sadness, Van Morrison’s ecstatic 
celebrations of life and I can 
identify with it and feel what the 
artists are feeling, try to think what 
they’re thinking, I’m reassured 
that music is greater than time, 
that the most important emotions 
can be communicated across 
generations, and that sometimes, 
one voice is all that matters. When 
you can express yourself with as 
much feeling as these artists can, 
when you can make somebody 
from an unimaginable future care 
about your small musical choices 
and subtle emotions behind the 
lyrics you sing, even if they don’t 
always understand why, you’ve 
done something immeasurably 
valuable.

Who is the coolest teacher 

you’ve ever had? Maybe they 
were well versed, well traveled, 
or even just very well dressed. 
Many favorite teachers are 
described as more relatable, 
or able to inspire interest or 
personal 
immersion 
into 
a 

typically academic topic.

Imagine 
an 
instructor 

who 
teaches 
only 
in 
the 

summertime, dictates writing 
techniques and the lessons to 
be derived from literature on 
the side of a mountain in the 
American northeast. He loves 
John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut 
and holds garnered experiences 

from the real-world application 
of inspiration derived from 
literature 
in 
the 
form 
of 

lyricism. This is because you 
have a teacher who also leads 
a double life as a celebrated 
indie folk singer-songwriter of 
especially potent fame in the 
Ann Arbor community. He’s the 
coolest teacher you’ve ever had; 
he is Chris Bathgate.

Though 
some 
University 

students may know Bathgate 
from his role at the University’s 
New 
England 
Literature 

program, his career extends 
far beyond the depths of the 
forrests of New Hampshire. 
Bathgate 
attended 
the 

University back in the early 
2000s and with the gained 

support and from the school’s 
community of musicians as well 
as the nurturing warmth of the 
general Ann Arbor music scene.

“Ann 
Arbor 
helped 
me 

the 
most 
in 
providing 
an 

infrastructure 
that 
allowed 

emerging 
musicians 
to 

grow;that’s 
probably 
the 

number one thing I can thank 
Ann 
Arbor 
for,” 
Bathgate 

said. And musical growth is 
what followed his collegiate 
experience.

In 
2006, 
Bathgate 

simultaneously released two 
albums, A Detailed Account of 
Three Dreams and Throatsleep, 
in addition to an EP. This 
excessive 
deployment 
of 

music was ultimately deemed

STYLE RECAP

Strobe lights and a rock ‘n’ 

roll stage defined the envi-
ronment for Saint Laurent’s 
Fall ready-to-wear 2015 col-
lection at Paris fashion week. 
The show opened with the 
rise of a Courtney Love wan-
nabe model popping out of 
the ground and stomping her 
pink high-low prom dress 
down the runway. Unfortu-
nately, this tacky opening 
was a grim indication for how 
the rest of the show’s collec-
tion would appear. The punk 
theme was carried fairly lit-
erally throughout the entire 
collection. So much so that 
the workmanship of Hedi 
Slimane’s more constructed 
pieces was completely ignored 
in favor of the cliché styling. 
The shredded tights, up-to-
here leg slits and questionable 
cut outs pushed the collection 
into garish costume territory. 
There was also a lot of boob 
in the show, including a solo 
boob appearance from a dress 
that was supposedly intend-
ing to cover only half of the 
model’s chest.

As is usual for Saint Lau-

rent, the collection’s decent 
range of outerwear ended 

up being this season’s sav-
ing grace. By and far making 
the coolest statement at the 
show, the outerwear varied 
from structured blazers to 
furry oversized coats to long 
trenches, all of which played 
into the oversized androgy-
nous theme. The highlights 
of the outerwear pieces were 
of very contradicting styles: 
a silver, thigh-length trench 
coat and a flowing leopard 
print cape.

If this collection is any 

indication for the future of 
Slimane’s creations at Saint 
Laurent, the label may be in 
trouble of becoming the next 
overrated fashion house. A 
serious 
reconsideration 
of 

styling is in order for next sea-
son, as without the reckless 
overkill of bad girl clichés, 
this collection could have 
been a top performer at Paris 
fashion week.

successful, grabbing for him 
the 2006 title of “Best Solo 
Artist in Michigan” from Real 
Detroit Weekly. This young 
initial fame launched his career 
forward, as far as overseas, and 
placed him as the opening act 
of the experimental indie pop 
band, Saturday Looks Good to 
Me, in their European tour. He 
signed on to numerous labels, 
including the famous European, 
Björk-approved, 
One 
Little 

Indian. The opening track of 
his 2007 album A Cork Tale 
Wake, “Serpentine,” earned the 
acclaim of the NPR’s Song of the 
Day back in 2008. And since his 
accomplishments of the ’00s, 
and his gorgeously melodic 
most recent album, the 2011 Salt 
Year, Bathgate has remained, to 
the uneducated eye, relatively 
dormant.

“I 
took 
a 
hiatus 
from 

performing live for about two 
years and in the interim in that 
period of time I’ve been working 
on a record that’s actually tracking 
this week. And then I’ve also been 
working on a collaborative project 
titled SKULLLS, which is another 
record that will be coming out 
hopefully by the end of the year.”

All this while bouncing from 

a film set in Baton Rouge to a 
recording studio in New Orleans, 
Bathgate hasn’t abandoned his 
musical post. With his newest 
music 
venture, 
SKULLLS, 
a 

collaborative 
project 
that 
he 

admits gained more influence 
in the jazz and hip-hop world, 
and an upcoming tour for his 
nearly 
complete 
upcoming 

album, Bathgate’s creativity and 
musical advancements have not 
dissipated. Rather, as a riper 
musician, Bathgate holds the 
temperament and wisdom of an 
experienced artist. He holds a 
practiced process of inspiration 

that is still dictated in his most 
recent work: solitude, location 
and poetry.

“For the landscape I spend 

a lot of time on the coast, on the 
East and West, and in the South 
most recently, but whether or 
not the cultural music identity of 
those locations makes its way into 
the music—the landscape surely 
advances my state of mind,” 
Bathgate said. “So in the South 
there are these beautiful bald 
cypress groves and swamp land 
that are incredibly beautiful.”

Bathgate 
dissected 
himself 

further, explaining, “I don’t know 
if you could pinpoint one specific 
note or lyric that is directly 
connected to those landscapes but 
they definitely change my state of 
mind.”

“Solitude is always a neces-

sity, you just need time to work 
through your ideas and it’s diffi-
cult to create with people in that 
space, but with poetry, it’s kind 
of always been there,” Bathgate 
said. “With SKULLLS, this pres-
ence is definitely traceable.”

Unsurprising, isn’t it, that 

a 
jack-of-all-trades 
musician 

who holds skill in the complete 
spectrum of instruments, also 
assimilates the English language 
and his literary experience into 
his music. The Renaissance man 
himself bashfully implied it too.

“As the sole lyricist for my 

music, and in order to sustain 
this role, I think I will always 
find this to be true.”

And how exciting it is, really, 

for those individuals most apt 
to find indie folk inspiring are 
also likely to find inspiration in 
the words of some of Bathgate’s 
favorites, like Steinbeck and 
Vonnegut.

His perfectionism is another 

concurrent 
constant 
for 
the 

Bathgate process, one that he 

admits “maybe it’s at the dismay 
of fans who are waiting for an 
artist’s newest art but you can 
only release a record once, so 
sometimes it just takes me more 
time.”

His complete rejection of 

any half-ass job, coupled with 
the seemingly endless amount 
of hats Bathgate wears, would 
obviously produce a man who 
just can’t release new music on 
an incredibly regular basis. With 
age and experience, he’s learned 
to allow himself more liberties 
with his work, letting “patience 
play a key role in composing and 
restructuring a song.”

Time and gathered influences 

have funneled his music into 
numerous pathways and styles, 
and so the perfectionism takes 
its positive toll – one that the 
fans like myself must dutifully 
endure.

Bathgate returns to the stage 

this spring with an initial set 
of shows in Michigan before 
continuing 
onto 
a 
larger 

audience on the East Coast. 
This long set of shows begins 
this Saturday, Mar. 14 at the 
Blind Pig where Bathgate will 
be performing with The Go 
Rounds and the Antivillains. 
The cyclical return of watching 
an Ann Arbor musician, a 
man 
so 
well 
versed, 
well 

traveled, and perhaps even well 
dressed, return to his original 
foundation of inspiration. His 
musical roots never feel far 
from his present self, a musician 
who once found inspiration 
in the accessible solitude of 
North Campus, surrounded by a 
landscape of student musicians, 
allowing the ebb and flow of 
literary academia impact his 
sound – everything now has 
changed, but everything has 
stayed the same.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

An alarm beeps at 5:00 a.m. 

and an arm covered in blue paja-
mas swings over and snoozes 
it. 
Wait, 
I 

have 
that 

clock! WAIT, 
that 
arm 
is 

attached 
to 

Tom 
Hanks! 

Yes, “Call Me 
Maybe” song-
stress, 
Carly 

Rae 
Jepsen, 

managed 
to 

cast Tom Hanks as the star of 
her newest (and bestest) video.

As Hanks sits up in bed, the 

beat slithers in through his 
penthouse windows amid the 
morning darkness. Holy shit. 
In the middle of a five-in-the-
morning-stare-at-the-carpet-
in-distress moment he begins to 
lip-sync the first verse. He rubs 
his eyes, stretches and the magic 
begins. As he looks into the bath-
room mirror, his demeanor and 
performance gain some more 
energy and, BOOM, as he lifts 
his head from spitting up some 
mouthwash, he is walking along 
a street in NYC high-fiving and 
fist bumping anyone who walks 
by. I really want a fist bump from 
Tom Hanks at this point.

As he jumps into a cab, an 

emojiful conversation between 
Carly and him appears on screen; 
it’s time for them to meet up at 
the real video shoot. Walking 
the last leg of the trip, bystanders 
are seen swiping right on Hank’s 
Tinder profile (who wouldn’t??). 
During final touches, Hanks 
pauses to recite the song’s short 
conversation.

Hanks: I’m pregnant.
Jepson: Okay
Hanks: Just kidding.
YES. Now the duo, along with 

a crowd of back-up dancers, 
perform a thriller-esque street 
dance. It’s brilliant and infec-

tious. Hanks’s moves are dad-
meets-boyband. Wait, who is 
that dancing next to Jepsen? Oh 
wow, that’s Justin Bieber. And 
for a total of 21 life-altering sec-
onds, Bieber manages to not be a 
tool and Hanks follows Jepsen’s 
carefree choreography.

Hanks gives a humorous and 

uplifting dub of “I Really Like 
You.” His stagnant upper-lip just 
adds another layer of awesome-
ness. It’s not supposed to be seri-
ous, and Jepsen certainly knows 
how to put on a good time. I real-
ly really really really really really 
like this video. And you do too.
