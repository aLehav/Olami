Student-launched

real-time ratings

StatusOwl, a new iOS appli-
cation launched by two Uni-
versity graduates last week,
is working to change the way,

Students can use the app to
both post and follow real-time

updates on private and public
venues in the area. In addition
to posting statuses, users can
rate drinking establishments
on entry line length and occu-
pancy level. Currently, 40 local
bars are searchable on the app.
To gauge each post's accu-
racy, "up" and "down" buttons
appear so that others can agree
or disagree with the current
status assigned to a particular
establishment.
The app also syncs with
Facebook, making it easier to
share private events like house
parties only with friends. Users
also have the option to send

friend requests through the
app.
StatusOwl's founders
include University alums
Aakash Jobanputra and Samir
Thanedar, and Engineering
senior Asif Aziz, who was also
responsible for developing and
producing the social media
platform from scratch.
"We're a real time guide for
night life," Jobanputra said.
"Everyone can go on StatusOwl
and see what's going on and
honestly make better decisions
about where they're trying to
go."
The idea for StatusOwl was

born on a wintry night, short-
ly after local authorities shut
down a fraternity party. Not
wanting to risk a walk in the
cold to get to another party
that wasn't a sure bet, Joban-
putra and Thanedar said they
wished they had live updates
of the campus' goings-on, apart
from Facebook event pages that
remained relatively static.
As graduates, Jobanputra

their project full time. Aziz has

ByYARDAINAMRON

Fewer than two months have
passed since University President
Mark Schlissel moved into the pres-
ident's office in the FlemingAdmin-
istration Building, and his plate is
already full.
Last year was one to remem-
ber, with big issues springing up
across the Diag. Inthe fall, students
from the University's -Black Stu-
dent Union launched the #BBUM
Twitter campaign that trended
nationally and challenged the Uni-
versity to improve campus climate
and address minority enrollment.
In the spring, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education launched an
investigation into the University's
handling of allegations of sexual
m sconduct and the administration
was prompted to respond to the
concerns of faculty anditaff-after
the University opted to consolidate

more than a hundred department-
level staff to a shared services cen-
ter.
But while Schlissel is still get-
ting his bearings, University units
pushed ahead throughthese chal-
lenges over the summer.
The Trotter Multicultural Cen-
ter, which was a focus of BSU's
protests, smells of fresh paint and
sawdust from recent renovations
- an achievement of the BSU's
dialogue with the administration.
The $300,000 renovations are just
a temporary fix, and plans to move
Trotter to a more central location,
which the BSU originally demand-
ed, are also in motion.
Jackie Simpson, the new director
of the Trotter Multicultural Center,
said that while she hasn't met with
Schlissel personally, he did make
the cross-campus walk from the
Fleming Administration Building to
Trotter a few weeks ago for a tour.
Schlissel said it was a "nice place,
old building," according to Simp-
son, who said a new Trotter is still
three to five years away. The pro-
cess though, has already begun: an
architecture firm has been hired

After unforseen
circumstances,
Lustig outlines new
initiatives, goals
By TANAZ ARMED
Daily StaffReporter
When University students
filled out their online ballots for
Central Student Government
officers last spring, LSA senior
Emily Lustig wasn't on the presi-
dential ticket.

However, aLustig assumed
office as CSG's vice president
Tuesday. LSA junior Meagan
Shokar, who was elected along
with Public Policy senior Bobby
Dishell in April, resigned Fri-
day due to a medical condi-
tion. Within days, Dishell and
Shokar tapped Lustig to fill the
vacant slot and their choice was
approved Tuesday by the CSG
Executives Nominations Com-
mittee.
Though the leadership transi-
tion was abrupt, Lustig said CSG
has been an integral piece of her
college experience.

"I started off my freshman
year as a rep on the assembly and
that was phenomenal," she said.
"I really got a feel for how resolu-
tions work, how to gauge student
interest and how to really repre-
sent the student constituents as
you're supposed to as an assem-
bly rep."
Although 30 of 40 CSG rep-
resentatives voted in favor of
Lustig's appointment, some CSG
members felt the nomination
and selection process failed to
consider input from the entire
student body.

Japan's first lady says

Study shows Millennials'less

husband helps with chores trusting than predecessors

Prime Minister calls
for cultural shift in
the workplace
TOKYO (AP) - Japan's first
lady says she has such a busy
schedule that sometimes it's up
to the prime minister to do the
dishes or take out the garbage.
It's the kind of flexibility that
Akie Abe says is needed for the
advancement of women in Japan.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is
pushing companies and the gov-
ernmentto hire and promote more
women to allow Japan's economy
to grow and create a society where
"women can shine." He appointed
five women to his18-member Cab-
inet on Wednesday.
Even though Akie Abe, 52,
openly refers to herself as a
member of the "opposition in the
household" on some issues her
husband favors, such as nuclear
energy, she told The Associated
Press on Thursday that she is a
H,.

big supporter of his "womenom-
ics" policyof promoting women's
advancement.
In Japan, women are under-
represented in senior-level posi-
tions in companies, government
or universities. They have long
been discriminated against in
salary and promotion in corpo-
rate Japan, and often face obsta-
cles to pursuing their careers due
to a lack of help from spouses.
Abe, the daughter of the for-
mer president of a leading Japa-
nese confectioner, Morinaga
& Co., said it's important that
society allows women enough
flexibility to work again after
child-rearing or other life events
that interrupt their professional
careers.
Her husband's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party has conserva-
tive views on gender equality,
but the first lady is a business-
woman, owns a bar in downtown
Tokyo, and supports local art-
ists and craftsmen. She is active
in organic farming and grows
5-M

rice herself in Yamaguchi, her
husband's hometown in western
Japan, and campaigns against
AIDS and discrimination against
minorities.
Next week, she will speak
at "The World Assembly for
Women in Tokyo," an interna-
tional symposium at which she
wants to show that Japanese
women are also serious about
making a society that is friend-
lier to them.
Such activities, along with
her differences with some of her
husband's views, have contrib-
uted to her image as a new breed
of first lady.
"My husband's conservative
supporters think the wife of a
prime minister should keep quiet
and support him, so for them my
speaking up is unthinkable, but
those on the other side of the
spectrum say I should speak up
even more," she said in an inter-
view at the prime minister's offi-
cial residence.
The first lady said people
tend to categorize others, like
right and left, west versus east,
"or men should be this way and
women that way," creating walls
and differences. "I want to tear
them down," she said.
Abe is often out all day, leav-
ing herself little time for house-
cleaning. The couple has chosen
to live mostly in their own home
in Tokyo, rather than the official
residence, so they don't have the
benefit of government household
staff.
She said she sometimes hears
her husband mumbling about
the house, but that he is never a
bossy husband telling her to do
things for him.
She said he does chores when
he can, including sometimes
washing the clothes.
"Sometimes he tries to move
things out of the way, but , end
up scolding him for putting
things in the wrong place. Poor
thing," she said.
Abe said women tend to work
harder than men in many parts
of the world but are not repre-
sented fairly.

Young people are
distrustful of Wall
Street, police and
government
CHICAGO (AP) - They're
often pegged as the civic-minded,
do-gooding generation. But while
they're still optimistic about their
own personal prospects, a new
study finds that today's youth are
often more skeptical of the coun-
try's institutions than the young
generations that preceded them.
The Millennials also are as
mistrusting of other people as the
gloomy "slackers" of Generation X
were 20 years ago - or even more
so.
Jean Twenge, .lead author of
the study that will be published
early this month in the online
edition of the journal Psycho-
logical Science, says the current
atmosphere - fed by the Great
Recession, mass shootings, and
everything from church sex abuse
scandals and racial strife to the
endless parade of publicly shamed
politicians, athletes and celebri-
ties - may help explain why this
young generation's trust levels hit
an all-time low in 2012, the most
recent data available.
In the mid-1970s, when baby
boomers were coming of age,
about a third of high school
seniors agreed that "most people
can be trusted."
That dropped to 18 percent in
the early 1990s for Gen Xers -
and then, in 2012, to just 16 per-
cent of Millennials.
The researchers also found that
Millennials' approval of major
institutions - from Congress and
corporations to the news media
and educational and religious
institutions - dropped more
sharply than other generations in
the decade that followed the ter-
rorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
"Young people today feel dis-
connected and alienated," says
Twenge, a psychologist and pro-
fessor at San Diego State Uni-
versity, who wrote a book on

Millennials called *"Generation surveyed said Congress was doing

The Michigan Department

The department is launching
a new challenge among school

A U.S. appeals court issued
a scathing, unequivocal rul-

on the same day that 32 states
 asked the Supreme Court to set-
tle the issue once and for all.
The U.S. 7th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago was the
fourth to hear arguments on the
issue. The decision from a nor-
mally slow and deliberative court
was released a little more than a
week after oral arguments.
The unanimous, 40-page deci-
sion from a three-judge panel
blasted the states' justifications
for their bans, several times'
singling out the argument that
only marriage between a man
and a woman should be allowed
because it's - simply - tradition.

The Justice Department
launched a broad investigation
Thursday into the police depart-

lowing the shooting last month
of an unarmed black 18-year-old
by a white police officer.
The investigation, which is
separate from an existing federal
probe into the Aug. 9 shooting of
Michel Brown, will look for pat-
terns of discrimination within the
predominantly white department
and focus on how officers use
force, search and arrest suspects,
and treat inmates at the city jail.
The police department said it wel-
comed the investigation.
BAGHDAD
Sunni militants

kidnap dozens
of men in Iraq
Militants affiliated with the
extremist Islamic State group
abducted dozens of men from a
Sunni village north of Baghdad
on Thursday, residents said, as
two separate car bombings killed
23 people in the capital.
The militants took some 50
men from Tal Ali village, around
240 kilometers (170 miles) north
of Baghdad, according to resi-
dents. The men were loaded onto
trucks and driven away, they
said, speaking on condition of
anonymity out of fear of retribu-
tion.
The militants had retreated
from the village the day before,
fearing an attack by the Iraqi
 army. When they left, residents
set fire to an Islamic State flag.
The Islamic State group spear-
headed an offensive in June,
seizing vast swaths of northern
Iraq, including the country's
second largest city Mosul. The
P group has published grisly pho-
tos of the mass killingof captives
in areas under its control in Iraq

This summer, headquarters
of the Sexual Assault Prevention
& Awareness Center, or SAPAC,
moved locations due to renovations
underway at West Quad, which
relocated their offices to North
Quad.
SAPAC director Holly Rider-
Milkovich appeared eager to push
the small but influential organiza-
tion ahead into its busiest time of
year and solve a pressing problem:
a sexual assault reporting rate that
has improved, but has the potential
to improve.
According to a Washington Post
analysis, in 2012, the University
had the second-highest number of
reports of sexual offense on cam-
pus - 32. Rider-Milkovich said
1 in 33 men and 1 in 5 women are
assaultedin college.
"Our numbers do not yet
reflect that rate of victimiza-
tion," she said.
Though Schlissel may be
aware of the statistics, he has yet
to meet Rider-Milkovich or visit
SAPAC.

"We have one shot at this kind of

Creating partnerships with
public venues is the backbone of
the app's revenue model. So far,
StatusOwl has partnered with
seventeen bars in Ann Arbor's
downtown nightlife circuit The
app acts a a marketing platform
for these bars, but could also help
students save money on drinks
and win perks. Last Wednesday,
Good Time Charley's offered
double the prize money to app
users who won trivia rounds.
StatusOwl also shares drink
specials that are created by bars
to attract students earlier in the
night.
"If a certain bar usually gets
packed by 10 p.m., we want to
help them get packed by 9 p.m.
by adding a live advertisement to
people," Thanedar said.
The founders were particular-
ly proud of the fact that the app
crowdsources its information.

Lustig said. "It's a position she

president, which is fantastic. I'm
just going to try to make the best
of a bad situation."
Despite the circumstances,
Lustig said she is prepared to
manage a smooth transition.
"I'm very excited," she said.
"I talked to the assembly at the
meeting about how I think it's
going to be really important for
me to sit down with each of them
as well as the University Council
members and reach out and really
get to know them."
Lustig has served as the chair
of the Student Safety and Secu-
rity CSG commission for the past

Schlissel was aware of the campus
happenings, but the community
should be realistic about the expe-
rience of a transitioning president.
"The number of issues that he
can personally be involved in is
limited," Fitzgerald said. "Every-
body wants some of his time.
Particularly this early in his presi-
dency, he is naturally relying on the
administration around him."
At the beginning of August, the
Shared Services Center receivedits
firstwave ofstaff. Plansforthe cen-
ter were delayed last year after the
University received negative feed-
back from many faculty and staff
about the University's plan to save
money by consolidating staff from
different departments in a central
location off campus. Many critics
condemned the University for fail-
ing to be transparent and equitable
when carrying out the plans.
Pam Gabel, the director of the
center, also hasn't spoken directly
to Schlissel, but said she has kept
the center on track to transition the
next 150 staff members thisowinter.
"Certainly people weren't happy
theywereselected (torelocate),but
we have a pretty hefty engagement
plan to help themmake that transi-
tion," she said.
Fitzgerald said there is a more-
than-capable team around Schlis-
sel, adding that his restraint from
laying out detailed action plans for
many issues is for good reason.
"As (Schlissel) said very early
in that initial media briefing, he
is going to take time to listen and
understand the University deep-
ly before he creates priorities,"
Fitzgerald said.

app successful, it's everyone on

As part of this collaborative
outlook, Jobanputra and Thane-
dar plan to organize community
events in order to give back to
various charities.
A few hundred students have
downloaded the app on their
smartphones, but the founders
said they are working with Greek
Life members to drive more users
to the product.
The founders made an agree-
ment with the social chairs of
various fraternities where Sta-
tusOwl will provide a free rush
banner and promotional events
in exchange for the fraternities
using the app to advertise their
parties.
Delta Tau Delta, whose senior
house displays a StatusOwl ban-
ner, is one fraternity that is
workingclosely with the startup.
Engineering senior Peter Lind,
a DTD brother, said he has seen
many of his friends using the
app.
"The app is really functional
and it has a lot of potential for
Ann Arbor or any campus," Lind
said. "I use it all the time."

event was a way for students
to preview the Myo armband
before it is presented at this
weekend's MHacks IV.
"By having the event in a
closed setting, it's a lot more
intimate," Lee said. "It allows
for better communication, and
better understanding of what's
going on. If you were one in four
hundred kids, you can't really
ask questions."
Students first listened to
Chris Goodine, the so-called
"developer evangelist" at
Thalmic Labs - the creator of
Myo armband -, explain how
the Myo armband works and
watched him use the band to
fly a small drone around the
room.
Later, students were able to

test out the Myo armband by
putting it on their forearm and
following a number of prompts
on a computer screen. These
included waving the hand left
or right, touching the pinky to
the thumb or putting the hand
in a fist. The computer screen
then showed the user what
hand motions controlled things
such as music volume and room
temperature.
"Hardware is shifting
towards getting input from
the physical sense so it's really
interesting to see what start-
ups are coming with right now,"
LSA junior Robin Mehta said.
"And we get a hands on experi-
ence."
Goodine said the Myo arm-
band's name comes from the
gesture recognition technology,
known as electromyography.
This technology is currently
used in the medical setting for
measuring a patient's heart

activity with electrodes, among
other applications.
"Gesture control allows you
to enjoy digital technologies
with your hands," Goodine said.
"It's a more natural way of inter-
acting with everyday objects, so
the idea there is just having the
ability to do that in the digital
world as well."
The Myo armband picks up
small electrical signals that
are produced by muscles when
they contract. Over time the
Myo armband can adapt to the
motion of the users arm, giving
them gesture control.
Engineering freshman Ste-
ven Schmatz said he attended
the event to get a better under-
standing of gesture technology.
"The Myo band seems like a
device with so much potential
that you can use for hackathons,
for example," Schmatz said. "I
think wearable technology is
definitely going to revolution-

Pinsky added that Friendsy

"On Friendsy, all content

US to provide $75M to
expand Ebola care centers

The aid agency has
already donated
$20 million to
afflicted Liberia
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP)
- The American aid agency
announced Thursday it would
donate $75 million to fund
1,000 more beds in Ebola
treatment centers in Liberia
and buy 130,000 more protec-
tive suits for health care work-
ers.
West Africa's struggling
health systems have buckled
under the pressure of an Ebola
outbreak that has already
killed about 1,900 people.
Nurses in Liberia are wear-
ing rags over their heads to
protect themselves from the
dreaded disease, amid con-
cerns that shortages of pro-
tective gear throughout the
region are responsible for the
high Ebola death toll among
health workers.
The U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development also
urged American health care
workers to respond to the
outbreak. Rajiv Shah, the
agency's administrator, told
The Associated Press that
several hundred more inter-
national experts are needed
and the agency will help send
Americans health care work-
ers there.
"This will get worse before
it gets better," he said. "We
have a coherent and clear
strategy ... but it will take
weeks to months to get opera-
tional at that scale."
The $75 million comes in
addition to about $20 million
the agency has already donat-
ed to fight the outbreak that
was first identified in March
in Guinea, -and has spread
to Liberia, Sierra Leone and
Nigeria. The killer virus is
spread through bodily fluids
such as blood, sweat, urine or

diarrhea.
Health workers account for
about 10 percent of the deaths
so far. Much of the protec-
tive gear they use must be
destroyed after use, so Ebola
wards need a constant flow of
clean equipment.
One nurse at a hospital in
Monrovia, Liberia's capital,
said she and her colleagues
have resorted to cutting up
their old uniforms and try-
ing them over their faces to
protect themselves, looking
out through holes in the fab-
ric. She spoke on condition of
anonymity because she was
not authorized to talk to the
media.
"It is really pathetic," she
said. "We are not equipped to
face the situation."
With no goggles to protect
them, their eyes burn from
the fumes of chlorine used to
disinfect the ward, the nurse
said.
David and Nancy Write-
bol, American missionaries
who worked at another hos-
pital in Liberia, echoed those
concerns, speaking to the AP
in North Carolina. They said
doctors and nurses are over-
whelmed by a surge of patients
and there aren't enough haz-
ard suits to keep them safe.
Health care workers can go
through thousands of the suits
a week, David Writebol said,
and the suspension of flights
to the region by many airlines
is making it harder to get gear
in.
Three American health care
workers have been sickened
with Ebola while working in
Liberia. Nancy Writebol and
Dr. Kent Brantly were flown
back to the U.S. to be treated
and have since recovered,
while the third only recently
tested positive for the disease.
Another doctor who was
infected with Ebola while
working in Liberia is being
flown to a Nebraska hospital

for treatment, doctors there
said Thursday.
Officials at the Nebraska
Medical Center in Omaha said
Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, is expected
to arrive sometime Friday.
Sacra will begin treatment in
the hospital's 10-bed special
isolation unit, the largest of
four such units in the U.S.
Liberia has been hardest hit
by the current outbreak, with
the largest number of cases
and deaths. Doctors Without
Borders, which is running sev-
eral Ebola treatment centers,
said last week that its clinic
in Monrovia is overrun with
patients and doctors are no
longer able to provide intrave-
nous treatments.
The Liberian nurse, mean-
while, said she and her col-
leagues live every day with
the fear that they'll become
infected.
"When you go through this
and return home, you lie in
bed asking yourself: I am still
safe? Or I have contracted the
disease?" she said.
Meanwhile, health officials
were monitoring more than
200 people who may have been
exposed to Ebola in southern
Nigeria.
Authorities had been cau-
tiously optimistic that they
would be able to keep Nigeria's
outbreak relatively small since
the one sick Liberian-Amer-
ican who brought the disease
to Nigeria by plane was quick-
ly isolated.
But then last month a per-
son he had come into contact
with escaped surveillance and
fled to the southern oil hub of
Port Harcourt. The contact
infected a doctor, who, in turn,
exposed dozens of people to
the disease, the World Health
Organization said.
Of the 200 people identified
as exposed to the ill doctor,
WHO said about 60 are con-
sidered at high risk of getting
Ebola.

The socioeconomics of school

ALEXANDRA DULIN I
What's a survivor to do?

hoever believes that the "Ameri-
can Dream" is alive and well for
everyone is simply incorrect.
Though every adult strives
for success and happiness,
many childhoods come
with unchangeable factors
that hinder or strip future
success. These inhibitorsA
are systems of oppression.
In my experiences at
the University (and in life MICHAEL
in general) I've noticed SCRAMM
that lower socioeconomic
status is consistently and
blatantly swept under the rug. It's an oppres-
sor that its victims hate talking about, but its
consequences are cripplingly harsh.
Over the next few columns, I'll be tackling
some ways that socioeconomic status affects
children. First, I'd like to discuss the effect
of poverty on education. I choose education
because it's connected to a variety of benefits,
including income, diversity in career choice
and general happiness. The education gap
between wealthy and impoverished children
is significant. Students with parents in the
bottom 50percent of income ranges constitute
only 14 percent of undergraduate students.
That's an enormous number, and it has
already had a huge effect on every student's
daily life. Think about how this affects your
own life. How many incredible people are
missing from your college experience solely
because they didn't have financial advantages
to help them gain admittance?
Discrimination based on class
fundamentally affects children right from the
start. When wealthier parents settle down,
they're able to choose cities and districts
with thriving public education systems or
send their children to private schools. Lower-
SES parents are financially limited in terms:
of housinggofen forced-to settle in districts
that can't compete with the larger tax
base and renowned public schools in more
privileged towns.
Next we reach the college prep phases
of high school: junior and senior year.
Standardized tests like the ACT and SAT
are strongly correlated with parents' income
level. Studies have found that each $20,000
increase in parental income is associated
with 42.33 extra points on the SAT. That's
an estimated 378-point difference between
parents with incomes less than $20,000 and
more than $200,000. A few factors seem
to cause this gap. The previously discussed
educational differences in public schoolshave
now been present at least since kindergarten,
translating into discrepancies in different
schools' standardized testing scores.
Additionally, SAT and . ACT preparation
programs are grossly expensive. Online study
materials and courses can cost up to $600
and private tutoring ranges from $95 to $250

an hour. With lower-SES students unable to
afford such programs, their ability to achieve
high scores to gain admission into reputable
colleges is hindered.
Plus, let's not forget that affluent high
schools offer more college preparatory AP
classes that prove crucial for students to gain
an upper hand for acceptance at elite colleges.
Even if lower-SES students have equivalent
grades and scores, they're still less likely
to attend elite colleges. Only 50 percent of
low-income valedictorians applied to one
of the top 61 colleges - all private schools
- as opposed to 80 percent of middle- and
upper-class valedictorians. This difference
comes from schools with lower-SES families
being underfunded and consequentially
decreasing one-on-one assistance from
guidance counselors. These counselors are
more likely to provide college information
in a generalized format. Furthermore, these
counselors rarely possess the knowledge to
provide information on elite, distant schools.
What's worse is thatlower-SESvaledictorians
would likely go to these better schools if they
applied. Once these students were accepted
to these schools, they received funding
comparable or greater than local universities
and were as likely to accept admission as
the wealthier applicants. Therefore, a lack
of resources is one reason why poor, yet
academically successful students don't apply
to elite schools.
Let's not forget that college tuition fees in
America are substantially higher than the
majority of the world. So if you're a mediocre
student getting accepted to colleges, you
may have to turn them down unlike your
intellectually-equal-yet-wealthier peers that
also gain acceptance.
It's a compilation of these factors and many
more that help to explain the very drastic
achievementgaps and what's worse is that the
oppression continues to cycle. It is well docu-
mented that college educated parents tend to
make more money than uneducated parents.
This means that children from low income
environmentstend togrow into impoverished
adults that then raise poor children in an
endless cycle.
And I'm throwing all of these statistics and
dismaying realities so something is pounded
in your head: we live in a country with serious
problems, and we need to fix these problems.
We must evaluate whether programs and
policies like No Child Left Behind, Teach
for America, Common Core and Race to
the Top narrow the achievement gap for
impoverished students, and if they don't, we
must continue to inquire and seek solutions
until this gap is fixed.
Because those oppressed by this system
don't have the power to fix this on their own.

Currently in the United States,
there is a charged discussion sur-
rounding sexual assault. However,
much of this discussion has focused
on the perpetrators and does not
consider the view of survivors or
what they desire. Highly publicized
cases such as the Steubenville, Ohio
trial have highlighted the issues of
victim blaming in American society,
and the recent "permanent separa-
tion" of former Michigan football
kicker Brendan Gibbons from our
own University of Michigan has
highlighted institutional biases
against survivors of sexual assault.
Yet, the focus of these cases has
been on the perpetrators, rather
than the victim. According to the
Rape, Abuse, and Incest National
Network 1 in 6 American women
will be survivors of a completed or
attempted rape, and 3 percent of
men will as well. Rates are higher on
college campuses,awith t in 4 Ameri-
can women surviving an attempted
or completed rape. A recent study
on the University of Michigan cam-
pus by University research fellow
Michelle Munro found that 80 to 90
percent of rapes were perpetrated
by someone known to the survivor,
which is consistent with national
data. RAINN also reports that 60
percent of sexual assault cases go
unreported. It is essential that we
begin to focus on the experiences,
needs and desires of survivors.
. Millions of survivors have
endured the effects of sexual
assault, such as physical injury,
unwanted pregnancy and sexually
transmitted infections. Yet, a 2012
study with a nationwide sample
found that only 21 percent of sur-
vivors actually sought post-assault
medical services. Low conviction
and reportingrates forcases and the
small percentage of survivors seek-
ing medical care clearly indicate the
need for programs that comprehen-
sively address a survivor's health
needs, while providing evidence
and information to navigate the
challenge of pursuing prosecution.
Currently Sexual Assault Nurse
Examiner programs are the gold
standard approach to providing this
type of holistic care.
Before the advent of SANE pro-
grams by now-director Linda
Ledray in the late 1970s, survivors
seeking medical attention gener-
ally went to the emergency room.
Here they could experience long
wait times and treatment by doc-
tors and nurses who were not famil-
iar with post-assault care. These
lengthy stints in the waiting room
and inexperienced care could lead
to "retraumatization" for the sur-
vivor. Not only were forensic exams
done inadequately, but should a case
be pursued by law enforcement,
the healthcare professionals who
had treated the survivor were often
unable to testify. The implementa-
tion of SANE programs has served
to remedy these problems.
SANEs are nurses who have
received special training in post-
assault care and forensic evidence
collection. During their training,
SANEs are instructed in compas-
sionate care for survivors, which
can include administration of treat-
ment for injuries and of prophylac-
tics (medicine for the prevention of
pregnancy or STIs), and the collec-
tion and documentation of forensic
evidence. SANEs are also available
to testify. There are more than 700
SANE programs operating in the
United States, Canada and Aus-
tralia. SANE programs are housed

in hospitals, advocacy centers and
community organizations, oper-

ate 24 hours a day, and collaborate
with relevant community service
workers, such as sexual assault
advocates and law enforcement
personnel, all in order to improve
post-assault care and increase effi-
cacious prosecution of a case. In
order to find a SANE program near
you, use the search engine provided
by the International Association of
Forensic Nurses.
The process of SANE care
begins with an introductory visit,
obtaining consent for a medical
examination, and then addressing
immediate health needs. Some facil-
ities have specific rooms for SANE
exams, and the exam should always
be conducted in an area that guar-
antees privacy for the survivor. The
SANE will then ask for and record
a history of the survivor and the
assault. A head-to-toe examination
of the survivor is next, checking for
injury and evidence. These parts of
the exam can involve physical evi-
dence collection, such as hair, blood,
semen or vaginal fluid and photog-
raphy to document injury. Survivors
can say no at any point in the exam,
and they do not have to consent to
the exam kit being shown to law
enforcement. After the exam, the
SANE nurse will discuss and pre-
scribe any necessary prophylactics.
It is possible that a survivor may
ask for an advocate to be present for
part or all of the examination.
Data from a2012 study by Rebecca
Campbell, a psychology professor at
Michigan State University, suggests
that participation in a SANE exam
can lead to sexual assault cases pro-
gressing farther in the justice system
and can increase conviction rates for
perpetrators. The study underlined
the utility of DNA evidence: cases
with DNA evidence were almost
twice as likely to progress further
in the criminal justice system. This
highlights the importance of SANEs
as forensic evidence collectors. In a
separate study, Campbell indicated
that SANEs might also encourage
participation in the criminal jus-
tice system by attending to survi-
vors' feelings of guilt or blame and
by acting as an advocate during the
prosecution of a case. SANEs can
also dispel fears or myths like that
sexual assault always leaves injuries
(a large majority of sexual assault
survivors do not exhibit evidence
of physical injury). An important
note is that the collection of foren-
sic evidence does not yield defini-
tive results immediately and can
take months or years to be fully ana-
lyzed. Additionally, it is ultimately
up to the prosecutor to determine
the timeframe for the evidence to be
analyzed. These circumstances often
leave survivors feeling frustrated
and disempowered.
It is also important for survivors
to understand their rights in the
post-assault period, in order to fully
access the care that they desire. In
the past, in some states, in order
to receive a SANE exam, survivors
were obligated to agree to cooperate
with law enforcement and report
the assault. Changes made in 2005
to the Violence Against Women
Act, a fundamental piece of legisla-
tion in the protection of survivors
of domestic violence and sexual
assault, stopped this requirement,
making even those not wishing to
report the assault eligible for an
exam. This means that all survivors
now have the option to have forensic
evidence collected and stored, and
have a longer time to decide on pur-
suing legal action. However, while

states cannot require that survivors
report an assault, it is possible for

states to require hospitals to do so.In
Michigan, law enforcement is autd-
matically contacted when a SANE
exam is given. If law enforcement
is contacted, survivors are under
no obligation to cooperate with the
investigation, and may. choose not
to speak with officers. Some states,
including Michigan, also have man-
datory reporting laws for injuries
that appear to have been caused
by another crime, such as wounds
from knives or firearms, which may
have been perpetrated during a sex-
ual assault, or the require health-
care personnel to report when
the survivor is a minor or person
with disabilities.
Another provision of VAWA 1994
created STOP Violence Against
Women Formula Grants, in order
to better victim services and the
criminal justice system's response
to violence against women. In
states receiving these grants (all
states and the District of Colum-
bia), healthcare institutions must
provide forensic evidence exams
to survivors of domestic violence
and sexual assault without charge.
Survivors or survivors' insurance
cannot be asked to cover the exam.
This does not apply to the medical
examination, injury treatment or
any prescriptions that are received
in the course of a SANE exam.
However, states do have crime vic-
tim compensation programs that
can defray medical costs from an
assault. Though the title of VAWA
seems to indicate that its programs
are specifically for women, the law
actually applies to all sexes and
genders, including trans* individu-
als, and everyone is entitled to a
SANE exam.
Some survivors may choose not
to have a SANE exam or one might
not be available to them. In these
circumstances it is important that
survivors are aware of their other
options for care. Survivors can still
go to the emergency room for inju-
ries and prophylaxis, or schedule an
appointment with a general practi-
tioner, though by the time a general
practitioner is available, it may be
too late to collect forensic evidence.
Additionally, survivors can pursue
over-the-counter emergency con-
traception, in order to prevent preg-
nancy, Plan B, a form of emergency
contraception, is available over-the-
counterregardlessofage, sex,orgen-
der, andisusuallyabout$50inalocal
pharmacy and $40 at the University
Health Services (a $10 coupon can
be found at www.planbonestep.com
on the Plan B homepage). Survivors
can also seek services at rape crisis
or advocacy centers, such as SAPAC,
and with mental health profession-
als. They also have the choice of just
reporting to law enforcement. Col-
lege-age survivors can also choose to
report to their Office of Student Con-
duct. And finally, survivors can also
make the choice not to pursue any
form of care. It is critical to under-

PAUL SHERMAN|I
Those who compromise

If I were to tell you last week that House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor would lose
to Tea Party challenger and Randolph-
Macon College professor David Brat,
you probably would have thought that I
was crazy.
For Brat, his primary upset win over Cantor
was a "miracle."
If you look at the campaign finance
numbers and Cantor's election history, it
would seem that way. Cantor spent almost $5
million while Brat spent a meager $207,000.
Additionally, in terms of polling data, Cantor's
internal pollsters projected that he was going
to win by about 34 percent. In fact, according
to the graphic, Cantor was never really
challenged in a primary or general elections.
The smallest margin he had in an election was
17 percent.
So, for Cantor at least, there was no reason
for concern, right?
In this case, there was. Cantor's loss is one
of the most surprising upsets in quite some
time. In explaining Cantor's loss, the issue
that I have heard more often than not from
analysts is that the decider was immigration.
Thatmakes sense since America's immigration
system is in need of repair.
What surprised me the most in this was
the fact that people thought that Cantor was
a "liberal" and that he was being too soft on
immigration. First of all, Cantor is not a liberal

by any stretch of the imagination. After all, he
did support all of anti-Obamacare legislation. I
would define him more as a fairly conservative
Republican based on his track record. How-
ever, just because someone supports immigra-
tion reform doesn't mean that they support
"amnesty" (not to mention that the bill was a
conservative version of the DREAM Act!).
The message that I'm getting from all of
this is absolutely amazing and concerning
at the same time. To me, when a Republican
or any congressmen in general tries to reach
across the aisle and come to a compromise
with Democrats, it becomes a crime that must
be punished. It seems that Americans would
rather have members of Congress that are
sticking to their guns and voting along party
lines rather than creating solutions for real
change. People wonder why the legislature
has turned into a "Do-Nothing Congress." The
lack of compromise is one of the reasons.
I know this has been going on for some time,
but it needs to be stopped now. Right now,
we need our leaders back. The ones that are
willing to compromise that is.
Whether or not you think it actually was a
"miracle", you should be concerned about the
changes that this election may be pointing
towards in the future.

Shopping in CVS a day before
moving back to Ann Arbor, I
knew there was one thingI didn't
have that I absolutely could not
return to campus without: a pair
of earbuds. I go through them like
students go through tissues in
winter, always getting the cheap-
est possible brand and then hoping
that for at least a few months they
can dealwith the wear and tear of
being stuffed into my pocket. I'm
wary of getting an expensive pair
because I don't trust that they can
deal with the abuse any more than
the cheap ones.
So last week, I got a simple
white pair ofearbuds with blue
accents around the tiny speakers
made by a company I didn't recog-
nize. I arrived home and plugged
them into my iPod, and immedi-
ately Iwas crestfallen. The sound
was awful, sounds-like-it's-com-
ing-through-drywall awful, like
Paul-McCartney-is-standing-at-
the-other-end-of-a-tunnel-yelling-
at-me-while-cars-are-going-by
awful.
Naturally, I was disappointed,
and mostly I just can't wait until
they break so I canjustify sud-
denly buying another pair, but at
the same time, while dealingwith
the horrendous audio quality, I
noticed something pretty cool: a
lot of the music I was hearing - if
it was from the right eraor genre
- sounded different, but in a way
that actually seemed to fit.
All songs have a home. Not
in the recording studio, where
they're justseparate instrumen-
tal and vocal tracks expertly put
together by a producer. And not
in an arenaor at a festival where
everyone, including the artist
present, has certain expectations
for how a song's going to be struc-
tured and how it sounds. No, there
are certain locations and situa-
tions - the kind of place where an
artist could've never consciously
intended his or her songs to be
heard - where a song justfeels
right. The setting where you hear a

FIELD HOCKEY
Upgraded facility
awaits Wolverines

Pankratz calls
stadium best venue
in the country
By MITCH BECKMAN
r Daily Sports Writer
After weeks on the road,
Michigan field hockey is finally
home.
Due to lagging renovations to
Phyllis Ocker
Field, the
Wolverines William &
were forced maryi CMU
to spend their
preseason at Michigan
training in Matchup:
Virginia, then W&M 0-2;

games to No. 2 When:

Wake Forest 2 P.M.
- 5-1 and 3-2, Where: Phyllis
respectively. Ocker Field
Now, Ocker Stats:
Field is ready MGoBlue.com
and No. 17
Michigan is
looking to gain its first win.
Week two of the season
features William & Mary on
Saturday, followed by Central
Michigan on Sunday, and all
three teams will be searching
for their first win. The Tribe fell
to Virginia and Richmond, while
the Chippewas were upended by
Maine and Duke.
Though the Wolverines came
out of their first weekend winless,
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz
was pleased with how the team
adapted to the unique situation.
"The team did great," Pankratz
said. "We were doing everything
on the fly and had three weeks in

hotels. I'm really proud ofthe way
they handled it and now we're
super excited to be back at the
best facilityin the nation."
Historically, the Wolverines
have fared well against William
& Mary and Central Michigan,
notching a combined 36=16-2
record against the pair. Despite
the success, Michigan is stillwary
of its opponents.
"Both teams this weekend
are strong programs," Pankratz
said. "William & Mary has a
long tradition as a program and
Central is a tough team too. We
need to play well against both to
wn."
Heading into the weekend,
the team is looking to shore up
its offensive play, particularly
around the goal. Against Wake
Forest, the Wolverines outshot
Wake Forest 17-12 but could only
muster two goals. The same
problem plagued them against
North Carolina, when they scored
only once.
"We played well, especially in
the Wake Forest game," Pankratz
said. "We couldn't finish on
offense, and that's something we
want to fix this weekend. We just
need to polish up the details."
In the net, Michigan split time
betweengoaltenderslastweekend
and will likely do it again. Against
both Wake Forest and North
Carolina, redshirt sophomore
Chris Leub started in goal while
freshman Sam Swenson took
over for the second half. After one
weekend of level play between
the goaltenders, there is no clear
separation betweenthe two.
No matter who ends up in net
this weekend, the Wolverines
are optimistic that a pair of
homecoming wins could be the
start of something big at their
new home.

Once again, 'M' and ND bid farewell (or not

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Managing Sports Editor
Depending on which side
you're approaching it from, Notre.
Dame's decision to suspend its
football rivalry with Michigan is
either an unfortunate necessity
of conference realignment, or, as
coach Brady Hoke has suggested,
a deliberate move by the Irish to
make their schedule alittle easier.
"They're still going to play
Michigan State, they'll play
Purdue, they don't want to play
Mithigan," Hoke told attendees
of the West Michigan Sports
Commission in Grand Rapids
last May.
No matter how you feel about
the drama, remember two things:
Michigan and Notre Dame have
almost always been at odds, and
this isn't the first time the rivalry,
has been put on hold.
Thoughonthe other occasions,
it was Michigan's fault.
Leaders and Learners
In 1887, per Notre Dame's
request, Michigan traveled to
South Bend for a joint training.
session to teach the Irish
football. Not surprising given
the circumstances, Michigan
won the next day's game, 8-0,
an amicable beginning to what
would become a bitter rivalry.
"The Michigan boys, the
champions of the West, came
more to instruct them in the
points of the Rugby game than
to . win fresh laurels," wrote
Scholastic, Notre Dame's student
newspaper. "This occasion has
started an enthusiastic football
boom, and it is hoped that
coming years will witness a
series of these contests."
As the Wolverines departed
SouthBend, Scholasticcontinued,
Rev. President Matthew Walsh
thanked them and assured future
teams of a "cordial reception" on
their campus.
This weekend, you might have
s hard time findingthat.
The Wolverines won the
first -eight games of the series,
conceding just 10 points total
in that span, and the programs
met sporadically until the Irish
claimed their first victory over
Michigan in 1909.

Michigan and Notre Dame have intertwined stories, beginning with the Wolverines teaching the Irish football in 1887. The Daily dives into the history books.

Then, they didn't play again.
until 1942. What happened?
An untimely cancellation
The day of Michigan's game
at Notre Dame in 2012, Notre
Dame Athletic Director Jack
Swarbick delivered a note to
Dave Brandon. Not thinking
much of it, Brandon waited until
after the contest to read it.
Because the envelope had
been received before kickoff,
that night's Irish win counted as
one of the required three games
notice, meaning the series could
end in 2014 rather than 2015.
But last-minute cancellations
are nothing new. In fact,
Michigan did it first, and with
much less warning.
The Wolverines were
scheduled to host Notre Dame
in 1910, but Michigan coach
Fielding H. Yost argued that
two Irish players had exceeded
their eligibility. The team
from South Bend, though, said
otherwise and planned to dress
the athletes in question.
So the day before the game,
Michigan called it off.

.

"It is understood here that
this ends all athletic relations
between Michigan and Notre
Dame," The New York Times.
reported on Nov. 5, 1910.
Some of the animosity
stemmed from Yost's disdain for
Catholics. By the mid-1920s, he
spearheaded a campaign to bar
Notre Dame from joining the
Big Ten or playing conference
opponents.
The Wolverines didn't meet
their nearby rivals again until
1942, after Yost had left his
position as Athletic Director.
Blip in the radar: Two
meetings during World War II
In 1942 and 1943, Michigan
and Notre Dame met in a home-
and-home series, with each team
winning on the road.
But relations between coaches
Fritz Crisler and the Irish's
Frank Leahy were strained.
When Notre Dame invited
Crisler to its postseason banquet
in 1942, the Michigan coach
replied expressing his "deep
disappointment" in having to
decline, according to John Kryk's


book, Natural Enemies.
Later, Crisler told an alumnus
that, "I have my tongue in my
cheek when I say that."
After the 1943 meeting, Notre
Dame sought to schedule more
meetings with the Wolverines.
Crisler revealed Michigan's
position in December, telling
the Associated Press that "we'd
better wait until we know more
about what footballwill be like in
the next few years."
As Kryk's book details,
Crisler also believed that the
Wolverines' affiliation with the
Big Ten complicated efforts
to schedule Notre Dame, and
the coach regularly dismissed
Leahy's requests for future
meetings.
In 1946, Michigan even went
as far as creating an official
policy mandating that. their
three non-conference games be
against a team from the East,
one from the West and Michigan
State - which at the time was
independent - effectively
eliminating the Irish from
schedule consideration.
The series went on hiatus
again until 1978.

A man, a plan, Canham: The
modern era
Hired in 1968, at a time when
Michigan Stadium averaged
fewer than 70,000 fans, former
Athletic Director Don Canham
is the reason Michigan has had
at least 100,000 people crammed
into the Big House in every game
since Nov. 8, 1975.
He's known for slapping
the block 'M' on anything that
would sell in order to promote
Michigan's brand, but he also
recognized the value of big-name
opponents and rivalries.
Notre Dame Athletic Director
Moose Krause approached
Canham at a banquet before
the 1969 season and suggested
their football teams play again.
Canham quickly agreed with
a handshake, and the series
resumed in 1978.
The following year, Michigan
hosted the Irish for the first time
in more than three decades. And
on that afternoon, 105,111 fans
packed the Big House.
The teams have played
regularly since.

This isthe future
There's a reason the
Wolverines and Nbtre Dame
have met just 41 times since the
rivalry's humble roots in 1887.
The majority of the blame
falls on Michigan, which -
for legitimate reasons or not
- has found excuses to avoid
scheduling the program from
South Bend.
Last September, Irish
coach Brian Kelly stirred up
controversy by arguing that
the series isn't a "historic,
traditional" rivalry. At least in
some ways, he's right. Unlike
Michigan-Ohio State or Notre
Dame-USC, this one has almost
always been expendable,
Because of Notre Dame's
new obligation to play five ACC
programs every year, the Irish
had to make some cuts.
The rivalries with- Big Ten
adversaries Michigan State (77
total meetings) and Purdue
(85) survived. The one with
Michigan did not.
But in other ways, Kelly's
comments downplayed the
importance of the series.
Michigan and Notre Dame
are just three hours apart
by car. They possess storied,
intertwined histories (the birth
of the Irish football program, its
status as an FBS independent,
the fierce debate surroundingthe
1947 championship).
The game has served as a
barometer, an early test to
determine which program
deserves the most respect in
the Midwest. After all, Notre
Dame and Michigan boast 1,786
combined wins and are No. 1
and No. 2 in all-time winning
percentage.
That margin is so close the
Wolverines can surpass the Irish
with a victory Saturday, a fitting
bookend to the series as it once
again enters a hiatus.
For a rivalry with so much
history, it has been mired by
controversy, and abandoned
time and again for petty and
political reasons.
But Saturday, just like that day
127 years ago, the Wolverines
will travel to South Bend and
there will be football.

The series' three best games Who gets the last laugh?

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
The Daily has been covering
the rivalry since 1920, and we
broke downthethreebestgames
in the storied history.
No. 3: Notre Dame 29 -
Michigan 27 (1980)
The Daily dubbed it a
"seesaw battle" in which the
Fighting Irish's Harry Oliver
nailed a 51-yard field goal as
time expired.
Oliver, who called the kick
"by far the greatest moment of
my life," finished a drive that
began with just 41 seconds to go
in the game.
Michigan, though, had
mounted a comeback after it
fell down 14-0 early in the first
half. It fought back to score 21
unanswered points thanks to
two touchdown passes from
John Wangler.
He threw his third late in the
fourth quarter to Craig Dunaway
to give the Wolverines the lead
for a fleeting moment.
Former coach Bo
Schembechler said then: "It was
a great Michigan effort. We have
nothing to be ashamed of."
The Daily's Stan Bradbury
called it, "Heartache, plain and
simple."
Notre Dame and Michigan
both lost two games that season,
but the Wolverines won the Rose
Bowl that year over Washington.
No. 2: Michigan 26 - Notre
Dame 24(1994)
The Wolverines exacted
revenge after the 1980
heartbreaking loss by delivering
one of their own.
Michigan quarterback Todd
Collins mounted a drive with
46 seconds to go on the 17-yard
line, marching down the field,
escaping what seemed to be an
imminent sack to set up Remy
Hamilton's 42-yard field goal
with seven seconds to go.

Hamilton kicked three field
goals before that, connecting on
his longest for the game winner.
Until then, Hamilton had made
one field goal in his entire career.
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz
called a timeout as the play clock
wound down in an attempt to ice
Hamilton, but the added time
gave him a chance toset up.
"(Notre Dame) did us a favor,"
Hamilton said after the game.
"Thanks, Lou."
Wolverine fans swarmed the
field and stormed down South
University in celebration.
"I'm sure I won't appreciate
this until I'm older," Hamilton
said.
Collins, meanwhile, passed
for 224 yards while tailback
Tshimanga Biakabutuka (an
all-time great name) rushed
for 100 yards. Collins shined in
a game overshadowed by star
quarterback Ron Pawlus.
Michael Rosenburg, now with
Sports Illustrated, wrote then:
"I'm telling you it's perfect.
Another chapter in the folklore."
No. 1: Michigan 35 - Notre
Dame 31(2011)
Games like this are tough to

script. The kind that are hyped
up so much and live up to it.
In the program's first-ever
night game, Michigan completed
one of its best finishes. Trailing
24-7, the Wolverines scored
21 unanswered points behind
quarterback Denard Robinson.
Even the Fighting Irish's
touchdown with 30 seconds left
to retake the lead wasn't enough.
Robinson erased three
quarters of ugly football when he
found Jeremy Gallon alone on the
sideline before connecting with
Roy Roundtree in the end zone
with two seconds remaining.
The Daily's Tim Rohan, now
with the New York Times, said
of the game in his column: "The
crowd was roaring, woken up
from its slumber by a team that
needed waking itself. Every
maize pom-pom beat the air in
unison. The event - the first
night game ever, the largest
crowd ever, the anticipation
building because it seemed
everyone who had ever called
Ann Arbor home was back in
town this weekend - felt larger
than life. Under the lights.
"And the game was outshining
the event."

Hoke has acknowledged that

on the road. He has taken to

said. "It's right in back of us."
On the field, Notre Dame
presents its own problems.

season because of academic
dishonesty. He threw for 295
yards and two touchdowns in
