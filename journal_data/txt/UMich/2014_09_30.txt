University 'allocated
money before BSU's
demands called for
facility updates
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
Though University officials
pledged $300,000 in additional
upgrades to the Trotter Multicul-
tural Center last winter, the reno-
vation's cost ultimately totaled
$650,000, according to officials
familiar with the project.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University had'
already allocated $350,000 for
renovations at Trotter when the
University's Black Student Union
first lobbied for a more adequate
facility in January, bringing the
project total to $650,000,
While the University announced
it would provide $300,000 for
repairs - in direct response to one
of the Black Student Union's seven
demands -to increase diversity
and inclusion, on campus - the
project's 'total costs had not been
previously reported.,
The facility reopened its doors
earlier this month.
Loren Rullman, associate vice-

president for student life, said the
University's Architecture, Engi-
neeringand Construction - a divi-
sion of Facilities and Operations
- worked with studentsto identify
priorities for renovation.
"Feedback from students and
staff about these improvements
has been incredibly positive," he
said.
Upgrades included removing
and trimming of exterior shrub-
bery, replacement of old entrance
doors and locking devices, new
interior painting, window repairs
and caulking, desk lams and task
lighting improvements, parking lot
repairs and resurfacing.
"The second $300,000 was an
ackrowledgement that the mul-
ticultural center mnatters," Rul-
lman said. "It was sort of a bridge
between the current multicultural
center ... and our plans for a new
one. The funding conveys the Uni-
versity's commitment to student
needs and our institutional values
of community and diversity."
"The funding conveys the
University's commitment to

Albania, ' the ''latest
candidate for European
Union; membership, made a
small piece of history at the
University Monday with a
lecture given by the country's

president Bujar Nishani.
Nishani spent his 48th
birthday lecturing about Alba-
nia's history and its transition
to democracy before an audi-
ence of approximately 550
at the Rackham Auditorium.
He also met with University
President Mark Schlissel prior
to the event and presented him
with a statue of Mother Tere-
sa, who was an ethnic Alba-
nian..r
Rachel Brichta, a
communications specialist at
the University's International
.Institute, .,said - Nishani's
visit was made possible by a

student who approached the
Weiser Center for Emerging
Democracies about bringing
the Albanian president to
speak at the University.
Prior to being elected presi-
dent in July 2012, Nishani
served as Albania's minister
of justice and minister of the
interior. He spoke about the
evolution of Albania since the
fall of the communist regime
there in 1991, and discussed
Albania's candidacy for Euro-
pean Union membership.
The Council of the European
Union, made up of One repre-
sentative from each EU mem-

ber state, endorsed Albania's
bid on June 27.
"During the last 24 years,
Albania has undergone the
deepest, widest and most
intensive transformation
known by our national his-
tory," Nishani said.
Nishani noted that EU mem-
bership is a top priority for the
country and hopes Albania
will be prepared to become a
member within 10 years.
"No other people in South-
east Europe has supported
with such determination... the
European integration like the

'U' President calls for
college affordability
in network's tour of
college campuses
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
C-SPAN's Big Ten Tour rolled
into town Monday morning for
an interview with University
President Mark Schlissel.
In a live, Q&A-style interview,
Schlissel answered questions
about a range of topics, though
the conversation was dominated
by questions regarding the acces-
sibility and affordability of a Uni-
versity education.
C-SPAN, a cable network that
primarily airs federal govern-
ment proceedings and other
public affairs programs, is
conducting a bus tour to all 14
schools in the Big Ten to discuss

higher education policy with uni-
versity presidents and provosts.
Program hosts will speak
Tuesday with Joseph Steinmetz,
Ohio State University executive
vice president and provost, fol-
lowed by a discussion Thursday
with Eric Barron, Pennsylvania
State University president.
Throughout the interview,
which aired on the C-SPAN
series "Washington Journal" and
included call-in questions from
students, educators, faculty and
Michigan residents, Schlissel
repeatedly emphasized the role
of public universities in challeng-
ing inequality.
"One of the missions of pub-
lic universities is to, in effedt,
redress the misdistribution of
income across our society," he
said. "To me, the most tried and
true way to do that is through
higher education. The challenge
is to identify students, regard-
less of their background, who are

Coffee shop to relocate
above Literati bookstore

The Espresso Bar
to occupy second
floor space on E.
Washington
By CHRISTY SONG
Daily Staff Reporter
Literature and coffee beans
will make a new pairing in
downtown Ann Arbor.
Literati Bookstore and The
Espresso Bar are taking over
the second floor of 124 E.
Washington St., the building
in which Literati is located.
The independent bookstore
will receive the keys to the sec-
ond floor by mid-October and
aims to have its grand reveal
sometime before Thanksgiv-
ing, Literati owner Hilary Gus-
tafson said.
Not long after opening the
bookstore in March 2013, Gus-
tafson discovered The Espresso
H-IM

Bar, located at 327 Braun Ct. in
Kerrytown, and grew familiar
with its coffee as well as its
owner, Sandy Bledsoe.
"We visited his coffee shop
all of the time and noticed that
his business was really thriving
and we were just running out of
space in terms of storage," Gus-
tafson said. "So, we were think-
ing about ways in which we
could have some more space,
but be more creative about it."
Both businesses were facing
issues with limited space. After
six months of discussion, they
decided to purchase the second
floor of the Literati building.
Currently, Literati is com-
posed of a lower level and a
main level. Both are about 1,300
square feet, totaling about
2,600 square feet of space.
That figure will grow to 3,900
square feet with the addition
of the second floor. The lower
level contains the store's non-
fiction collection, and the main
level houses its fiction collec-
5-M

tion, essays and artwork.
Gustafson said she plans to
place the coffee shop on the
second floor and dedicate the
new space to store events and
featured content such as "I
Heard It On NPR" and Literati
Top 25. The cafe will seat about
30 customers. Gustafson said
she wants to create a cozy envi-
ronment with exposed brick
walls and large windows.
The Espresso Bar's move to
the second floor of Literati will
signify a relocation from its
Kerrytown location rather than
the opening of a new branch for
the coffee shop.
"It was just a natural growth
of two thriving businesses
needing more space." Gus-
tafson said.

Law Prof. talks affirmative
action's constitutional place

Lecture discusses
history of the law in
relation to the 'U'
By JOEL GOLDSTEIN
Daily Staff Reporter
Discussions surrounding affir-
mative action continued Monday
as University Law Prof. Richard
Primus lectured on the history
and constitutionality of the issue
at the Ford School of Public Pol-
icy.
Primus is an expert on con-
stitutional law and has clerked
for Supreme Court Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg. He is also a
four-time recipient of the L. Hart
Wright Award for Excellence in
Teaching.
"To say that affirmative action
is a hard and complex issue is to
vastly underestimate affirmative
action," Primus said. "Constitu-
tionality and legality of a particu-
lar measure is variable over time,
depending on what people think
it means."
Primus explained the history
of affirmative action policy, start-

ing with the Freedmen's
Bureau, which provided services
for former slaves during Recon-
struction. Eventually, Primus
said, the federal government
began focusing on anti-discrimi-
nation laws that were enforced by
agencies like the National Labor
Relations Board. In the 1960s and
1970s, NLRB's "cease and desist"
letters blocking discriminatory
hiring practices were supple-
mented with modern affirmative
action policies.
Part of Prinus' curriculum in
his Equal Protection class deals
with the University's influence on
affirmative action policy across
the country. The state of Michi-
gan has been a flashpoint in the
history of affirmative action.
Former University President
Lee Bollinger and the University
were named as defendants in two
Supreme Court cases: Grutter v.
Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger,
which upheld the legality of race-
based affirmative action under
certain guidlines. In 2014, the
Supreme Court ruled in Schuette
v. Coalition to Defend Affirma-
tive Action to uphold Michigan's
constitutional ban on affirmative

action.
According to Primus, former
Presidents Lyndon Johnson and
Richard Nixon created the affir-
mative action policies known
today. Primus also explained the
metamorphoses undergone by
the arguments in favor of affirma-
tive action.Primus said inthe'60s
and '70s affirmative action was
meant to rectify past or current
discrimination against Blacks,
while today most arguments in
favor of affirmative action focus
on the benefits ofhaving a diverse
workplace or school. Primus
said the argument for diversity
is easier to make because of how
contestable the subject of race is
in the United States.
Primus also discussed the
political realm of affirmative
action, as opposed to the poli-
tics. Affirmative action is a more
contentious issue for Americans
than legacy-based admissions
and preferences for athletes, even
though all three issues can be
viewed as degrading individual
meritocracy in college admis-
sions.

on the requests by the BSU.
Jackie Simpson, the newly
appointed director of Trotter,
said necessary improvements
also a included those to air
conditioning units. and safety
lighting.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Simpson said
Trotter is also launching a
series of new initiatives on top

of facility changes.
A student programing board
is in the works, as well as a
multicultural advisory board
intended to discuss current
campus climate issues. Orga-
nizers are also planning to
launch a health and wellness
initiative, which will include
Zumba classes and designated
forums for students to engage
in discussion.
As the University plans for
a new Trotter, Rullman said
there is not yet a budget set

aside for that project. The
planning process is currently
underway and the first focus
group met last Wednesday.
Simpson said she strongly
desires a central location for
the new center.
"I am firmly committed for
there to be a multicultural
center on Central Campus,"
Simpson said. "My goal in this
facility is to make it a place and
space that, until the new facil-
ity is built, students feel good
about coming to."

Albanians," Nishani said.
Political Science Prof. Anna
Grzymala-Busse, director of the
I Weiser Center, helped coordi-
nate the lecture. She also intro-
duced Nishani and noted that the
Weiser Center wanted to hear
Albania's perspective on its tran-
sition from a repressive regime
to a NATO military allowance
member and candidate for EU
membership.
"Albania, the country that
once built bunkers to fight.
against the West, became in
2009 a NATO member. Albanian
citizens who once were the most
isolated in the continent, now
travel in a visa-free regime in
Europe," Nishani said.
Nishani spoke about Albania's
long-standing religious toler-
ance, a relevant topic considering
the nation hosted Pope Francis
II last week. He said religion is
part of Albania's national heri-
tage and mentioned the peaceful
coexistence of various religions

within the country, as well as its
protection of many of its Jewish
citizens during World War II.
"Although a small nation, it
can provide a great contribution
with its model for religious tol-
erance and coexistence and of
accepting the others who are dif-
ferent," Nishani added.
He spoke about Albania's role
in the history of the Balkans and
emphasized that neutrality in the
conflicts ofneighboringcountries
has always been a priority.
He also focused on relations
between Albania and the United
States, which he said have large-
ly been positive dating back to
former U.S. Ambassador Charles
Telford Erickson's days in the
early 1900s. Though there was
some tension during the World
War II era, and a freeze during
the Cold War, Nishani said both
nations continue to be "close
friends, loyal allies and strategy
partners."
Nishani described Albanian
citizens as hardworking.
LSA senior Linda Camaj, pres-
ident of the Albanian American
Student Organization, said the
group does not have a specific

political preference and added
that Nishani's visit was well
received.
"As a group we are very sup-
portive just to have someone
from our country coming to the
University," Camaj said. "There
has been 100-percent positive
reaction to the president coming
here."
An audience member ques-
tioned Nishani on the country's
notoriety for corruption in its
judicial system. Nishani admit-
ted that the system still has
shortcomings, but noted that
under his presidency, there has
been a substantial increase in the
number of judges evaluated.
"The justice system reform is
one of the most crucial and need-
ed steps that we need to have in
our agenda now in Albania," Nis-
hani said.
Nishani also acknowledged
that crimes committed during
the communist era have to be
properly dealt with and noted
there are efforts to build insti-
tutions for restitution and com-
pensation of nationalized private
property during the communist
years.

talented enough to benefit from
the level of education we pro-
vide here."
When asked by a caller if he
believes the University's $13,486
in-state tuition and $41,906
out-of-state tuition - on top of
$10,246 room and board charges
- are affordable, Schlissel said
he recognizes the costs.
"College is expensive," he
said. "I view it as a lifetime
investment ... another invest-
ment that families can make
that will benefit their children
throughout their lifetimes."
He also stressed the adminis-
tration's commitment to making
a University education acces-
sible to all citizens of the state
and - to the best extent possible
- to students outside the state
and around the world. Schlissel
noted the University is one of
few public institutions commit-
ted to a need-blind admissions
policy for in-state applicants.
"If we are not successful
making a college education
affordable based on merit, based
on willingness to work hard,
then in the long run our country
is in big trouble," Schlissel said.
The University's Victors for
Michigan fundraisingcampaign
is aiming to raise at least $1 bil-
lion for financial aid, scholar-
ships, work-study programs and
graduate fellowships.
In light of the 2008 economic
downturn, Schlissel pinpointed
the challenges associated with
declining financial support
from the state.
"I think much to their credit
our current state government
is beginning to reinvest in
public higher education as the
economy recovers, and that is a
very good trend," he said. "That
said, the increase in tuition is
inversely proportional to the
decrease in public support. I
would love to think the level of
support would increase and the
tuition would moderate, but the

total amount of dollars it takes
to give students an outstanding
education is growing up mod-
estly."
Schlissel recalled his own
time as an undergraduate stu-
dent, when he took advantage of
financial aid and loans, in addi-
tion to working an off-campus
job, to cover the cost of college.
He also highlighted the Uni-
versity's Flint and Dearborn
campuses as prime options for
people working toward a degree
over a longer period of time,
often while working or fulfilling
other responsibilities.
The conversation about
accessibility also touched on
the reason tuition continues
to increase when the Univer-
sity has an $8.4 billion endow-
ment and Athletic Department
spending continues to increase.
Schlissel said a significant
portion of the endowment feeds
financial aid and that the Uni-
versity is hard at work to fund-
raise additional support.
Though he recognized ath-
letic spending has become larg-
er as the public and media pay
increased attention to college
sports, he noted athletics don't
draw from the University's gen-
eral fund.
"Here at the University of
Michigan we are very fortunate
because of the attention of our
alumni and the involvement of
the community in supporting
some of the major sports," he
said. "Our athletic programs are
self-supporting."
The men's basketball and
football programs provide
enough resources to pay for all
27 other men's and women's
sports, and provides approxi-
mately $20 million to the cam-
pus budget because it pays the
cost of its athletic scholarships
Though Schlissel almost
exclusively answered questions
regarding affordability in high-
er education, some callers ques-
tioned the breadth of University
course requirements. :
"College is more than trade
school," Schlissel said. "We are

educatingstudents for alifetime
and it is very difficult to predict
what their lifetime needs will
be."
Schlissel said course require-
ments are diverse in order to
provide students with a compre-
hensive undergraduate experi-
ence.
"The things driving the econ-
omy today barely existed 20
years ago," Schlissel said. "We
offer a breadth of different dis-
ciplines as well as a basic educa-
tion with a set of what we hope
are transferable skills to fuel a
lifetime of personal satisfaction
and employability."
Throughout the 45-minute
interview Schlissel consistently
emphasized the University's
efforts to improve affordabil-
ity - which he noted is a chal-
lenge for institutions across the
nation.
"The core mission of the Uni-
versity is transforming lives
through education and doing
research that will fuel future
opportunities in our economy,"
he said.
Following Schlissel's inter-
view, the C-SPAN tour bus was
open to students in front of
Rackham Auditorium. The bus
is customized as a multimedia
demonstration vehicle that vis-
its middle schools, high schools,
universities, debates, book festi-
vals and conventions.
The bus also includes touch-
screen computers, televisions
showing C-SPAN's various pro-
grams, a mini-classroom area
and free access to the network's
video library with more than
200,000 hours' worth of cover-
age dating back to 1987.
Doug Hemmig, a C-SPAN
community relations represen-
tative, said the program is hop-
ing to raise awareness about the
issues being faced by universi-
ties across the country.
"When we have the Univer-
sity president on it is really a
chance to engage the whole
community, not just the stu-
dents, but the city, and discuss
higher education," he said.

ride the policy.
After a discussion, SACUA
members unanimously decided
that the new policy did not assure
adequate representation of aca-
demic concerns and that they
would urge Schlissel to override
the model.
Business Economics Prof. Scott
MastenASAUTJA chair,.sai-the

group had some degree of choice
regarding the proposal.
"The issue from our perspec-
tive is, 'Do we want to override
all or none of it?' I think there will
be little pressure from athletic
directors to get faculty involved,"
Masten said. "I think the political
economy of this is, you're more
likely to see the two things you
want if you reject this."
SACUA said Schlisselis inclined
to override the proposal anyway,
but it wnuldbe helpful for himto

have the faculty's support.
Masten also recapped a recent
meeting with the deans of the
University's many schools. They
discussed similar sentiments of
a need for faculty inclusion in
administrative problems, and
Masten echoed their concerns.
"Too often faculty feel that it's
either ignored or resented when they
participate in central governance,"
he said. "It's really important to have
their expertise and to represent dif-
ferent units and their views."

LECTURE
From Page 1
The work examines other women
who also contributed to the
beginnings of the environmental
movement and how they comple-
mented Carson's efforts.
Carson's "Silent Spring"
described the harmful effects of
pesticides on the environment
and human health. When it was
published, the book played a
major role in raising the general
public's awareness of environ-
mental concerns, including the
popular chemical DDT. Carson
is seen as an environmental pio-
neer who singlehandedly cata-
lyzed the modern environmental
movement. Regarding the effect
of "Silent Spring" on today's
society, the Natural Resources
Defense Council states that the
book led to the birth of environ-
mentalism.
LAW
From Page 2
noted is the fact that beneficiaries
of affirmative action tend to have
lower grade point averages once
they get to college than students
who have not benefited from affir-
mative action. Affirmative action
is a popular topic in the news,
and survey data shows that more
people believe they have lost a
position or acceptance because of
affirmative action than the total
number of people who could pos-
sibly have lost a position or accep-
tance because of affirmative action
policy, Primus said.

During his lecture, Musil said
uncovering the other female fig-
ures in the environmental move-
ment who are not as popularized
as Carson was the main motiva-
tion for writing his book.
"I began to ask myself, as in
other areas of history, Rachel
Carson cannot be alone and the
only main woman," Musil said.
"I wanted to challenge the myth
that she was a lone genius."
Some of the prominent
female figures who are featured
in Musil's book include Shir-
ley Briggs, who collaborated
with Carson on multiple proj-
ects before "Silent Spring" and
became the first executive direc-
tor of the Rachel Carson Coun-
cil; Susan Fenimore Cooper, the
first female nature writer and
Dr. Alice Hamilton, a University
alumwho devoted her life to rais-
ing awareness of occupational
safety and health issues and who
pioneered the field of toxicology.
Officially, the University cannot
use racial preferences in its admis-
sions processes after the Supreme
Court upheld the state constitu-
tion's ban on affirmative action.
Following the 2006 referendum,
Black enrollment at the University
has fallen by about 30 percent.
"It was a watershed mark for
affirmative action and from my
personal standpoint, not neces-
sarily what I wanted to see," said
Rackham student Pete Haviland-
Eduah about the decision.
Haviland-Eduah was one of
a handful of University students
who attended the lecture because
of his interest in the intricacies of
affirmative action.

Musil's book also discusses
how the environmental move-
ment existed before Carson
wrote "Silent Spring," assert-
ing that the public perception
of Carson's book as the birth of
the environmental movement is
inaccurate.
"(Carson) worked with a close
network of friends to call atten-
tion to the problem that has been
around for years," Musil said.
"So the idea that ('Silent Spring')
started the movement is rather
far from the truth."
Though his book brings many
additional female figures into the
spotlight, Musil did not under-
mine Carson's works or legacies.
"(Carson) combined literature,
science, humanities, and health
sciences in ways that are quite
extraordinary," said Musil. "She
was the first, the most success-
ful, and the most popular envi-
ronmentalist to link nature with
human health."
Primus explained that the
University may have alternatives
to increasing diversity without
relying on affirmative action pro-
cesses. He cited an existing policy
implemented at the University of
Texas at Austin in which students
from the top 10 percent of public
high schools are automatically
admitted. Due to lingering racial
divides in Texas public schools,
this process has the potential to
bring in more Black students.
"I think the University of Michi-
gan has always had a history of
trying to promote diversity. And I
think the University should contin-
ue along that path." said Rackham
student Andrew Floyd.

he older I get, the more I realize that
it's not labels that make me uncomfort-
ablebut ratherthe weightcthey hold, the

expectations they carry and
the connotations that come
with them.
Still, there are plenty
of labels I identify with,
labels I carry proudly and
unapologetically. Labels that
don't define me, but rather
encompass little parts of my
existence. I'm a woman. I'm
an Arab. I'm a Muslim. These
are parts of my identity that
fit in little boxes. And while

HAYA
ALFARRAN

I'm comfortable identifying with them, I know
that those little boxes don't look the same to
everyone. The way I define my gender, ethnicity
and religion isvery specificto me.
Feminist is a label I go back and forth on
every day. I used to think I've been flirting with
feminism since I was 10, but I now realize we've
been courting since birth. I learned her name
when I was 15 and we've been slowly getting
acquainted ever since. Still, I sometimes don't
feel comfortable associating with her.
So let's talk about feminism.
When a woman identifies as a feminist, I've
found that the reactions include everything
from "so you're a man-hater" to "YAAAS." Over
the past year, there has been a popularization
of feminism. Countless celebrities and notable
figures have come out and stated their support
of it. Still, among all the diverse feminist
discourse on equal pay, reproductive rights and
respectability, there seems to be a different, ever-
present, unofficial debate. A debate on who gets
to identify as a feminist.
When Beyonce proclaimed her feminist
status last year, the world went wild. The
mainstream couldn't figure out what to do with
her proclamation. The public tried to figure
out whether she was a "true feminist" and
proceeded 1to scrutinize her life-to disprove it.
People picked apart her album, her wardrobe
and her choice to take on her husband's
last name.
The mainstream seems preoccupied with
the notion that there can only be one true form
of feminism. When I decided to call myself a
feminist, I was metwith questions. Can you be a
Muslim and a feminist? Can an Arab woman be

a feminist?
Yes. Hell, yes.
People assume my identity mustbe in conflict
with my feminist status, because there couldn't
possibly be a way to reconcile the two. My
little box of feminism looks a lot different than
Beyonce's, Emma Watson's, Malala Yousafzai's
and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's, but it's just
as valid.
Policing which women get to identify with
feminism has a multitude of repercussions.
It's just as harmful as the concept of feminism
being associated with anger and man-hating. It
propagates the idea that women must validate
their brand of feminism. It belittles the efforts
different women have contributed to the
movement for equality. When you propagate
the idea of true feminism, you're stripping
women, often those who belong to marginalized
identities, of the power to own their choices.
I'm tired, and I imagine that many other
women are too. I'm tired of having to justify
my opinions because I don't look like the
"ideal" feminist. I'm tired of being asked to
present my credentials at the door. I don't
understand why the world thinks that the
only way Muslim women can call themselves
feminists is if they run down the street nude
while renouncing their faith. I don't understand
why I have to constantly reassure people that
I'm not oppressed. Why I need them to validate
my choices.
When I made the decision to study abroad,
my parents got a lot of backlash for it. Different
family members and friends couldn't fathom how
my parents could let their 17-year-old daughter
move across an ocean unsupervised. Issues of my
safety and corruptibility were brought up. People
opposed their choice, because I was a girl. Still,
no one brought up the fact that I was pursuing a
better education. No one cared about that. The
day my parents got behind my decision was the
daymyparentsbecame feminists. (Sorrytobreak
it toyou Mom and Dad)When Idecided to put my
education ahead of my society's judgment, I too
became afeminist.

wasn't going to write a column
about Michigan football. In fact,
I had half an article on educa-
tion reformtyped
up and ready to
go. But, I suppose
my journalist
senses were tell-
ing me to strike
while the iron
was hot - or in
this case not - DEVIN
and talk about
some long needed EGGERT
reforms in Mich-
igan football.
Since I'm in an educational mindset,
I'll spell it out.
M stands for Marketing. From the
big block 'M' to "THE TEAM, THE
TEAM, THE TEAM" plastered on
jumbotrons, our T-shirts and our
hearts. We are the "Leaders and
Best" at outreach. I really do believe
that - and it's not necessarily a bad
thing. Recently though, it hurts
when I see those messages flashed
on the bigscreen. I question whether
or not our program reflects our val-
ues. At times, I feel like I'm playing
dress-up in the stadium with my
bright maize and blue. When I was
walkingback to North Campus from
the Utah game, drenched, I won-
dered whether I was a team member
or a spot to fill on ESPN's shot of the
student section.
I'm tired of the artificial feel.
I stands for In 1969. I sympathize
with the alumni who will absolutely
not take any criticisms of our team.
Back then, it was not all glory days.
Major challenges were overcome.
However, the atmosphere is much
different than what I was promised
entering the University. I want it to
be about football, friends and fami-
lies rooting for underdogs, topdogs
and such. Yet, promises remain hol-
low as the University's marketing
pocketbooks remain wholesome. It's
wrong to still be banking so much
off of Bo Schembechler's honorable
legacy. I'm starting to see tactics
instead of respect, a son that relies
on dad's legacyto stay relevant.
I, and perhaps many recent alumni,
don't feel the personal connection that

older alumni feel.
C stands for Challenges. If I can
figure out how to fully finance my
room and board at the University,
work two jobs and get good grades
while balancing my other commit-
ments like' so many of my friends
- you all can do the one job you're
getting paid multimillions of dollars
to do. There are so many excuses,
it's ridiculous. "He needs five years."
"We lost this guy or that guy."If
you're not going to give me a free
ticket for my troubles, I'm not going
to give you a free by-pass to sit on
your millions of dollars, because not
every statistic is right.
I'm not asking that we win - I'm
asking that if we lose it's not for
embarrassing reasons under our
control. Step up to challenges.
H stands for Honor. "The Team,
The Team, The Team." Tell me how
I should feel as a collegiate woman
in the stands shouting, "The Team,"
knowing that former kicker Brendan
Gibbons was put on the field. Gib-
bons was given the privilege to play
beside men who truly upheld the val-
ues of the University on and off the
field. Scoring points was chosen over
principles that directly affect me. In
the Minnesota game we witnessed
sophomore quarterback Shane Mor-
ris, with a potential concussion, put
in for a play that resulted in virtually
nothing anyway. A collegiate man's
safety was chosen over the use of a
timeout or a third- or fourth-string
player with a full scholarship.
An honorable game is not only told
by the scoreboard.
I stands for I SHOULD be able to
afford to pay for my siblings to go to
a freaking football game. Even with
everything going on, I STILL want
to take my little brothers and sisters
to a football game. I feel GUILTY
that I can't afford to purchase my
familytickets. If this is a program so
geared toward the legacy of family
at football games, it would make
sense for there to be some MAJOR
discount available for at least one
family game/family ticket package.
This is about the University
community. At least that's what
Marketing tells me.

ticket
We're not all rich here.
G stands for Game Day. Sorry
Scrooge, Tiny Tim is making a ruck-
us in the stadium. You're raising
ticket prices, not allowing us to buy
tickets with friends, switching idiot-
ic seating regulations constantly and
not giving us a community and fam-
ily feel. When seat-filling times get
desperate on your end due to your
own terrible management skills, do
you think we're going to grant you
any favors?
"Miscommunication caused the
'two Cokes for two tickets' national
embarrassment." The '100,000 sta-
dium attendance' mark is in jeopardy.
Scrooge, Tiny Tim isn't an idiot.
A stands for Attitude. Our mascot
is a freaking Wolverine - the most
badass, terrorizing, little badger of
our animal kingdom - known for
attackingcariboumanytimesitssize.
You're chanting you're a Wolverine?
A real Michigan Wolverine? Then
fight. Watch a full YouTube video
of a wolverine attacking a large
animal. Tell me when you stop
watching. Do you leave when the
small animal gets hit? No, you would
leave when you don't see the fight in
the wolverine anymore. That's just
sad to watch. Think of that next time
the audience leaves. We're with you,
Wolverines. We're paying absurd
prices to stay. We want to 'root
for you.
N stands for Not the NFL. My
high school history teacher told our
class that he never watches NFL.
He only watches college football,
because that's where he sees the
passion. Real kids who have having
something on the line -not someone
on a contract.
"Those Who Stay Will Be
Champions." Deserve to Stay.
Ifyou can sell me that next game or
next year, I'll gladly pay.
So, there are my two-cents about
the true price of a Michigan football
ticket in 2014. Its answer lies in what
we're selling. You can take it or leave
it. Unfortunately, you can't trade it
in for a Coke.

CHARLES ZHOU I
To Dave Brandon (and President Schlissel)

Dear Athletic Director Brandon,
You have no idea who I am, and
you probably don't care. Why do
I know that? Because you clearly
don't care about the opinions of the
generations of loyal Michigan fans
that have come before me, nor the
generation of lifelong fans that you
should be tryingto create right now.
With the team's poor
performance in recent games,
many people are calling for Coach
Brady Hoke to be fired. Iam not one
of those people, and those losses
are in no way your fault. However,
there needs to be a fundamental
change in the University Athletic
Department, and that begins
with you. Your job is safe for now
because University President
Mark Schlissel, while a capable
administrator, cannot claim to
come from a tradition of athletics,
regardless of what anybody says.
That's perfectly fine - he went
to Princeton and Johns Hopkins
and a tradition of athletics doesn't
exactly run through the veins of
every student at those institutions.
However, a president who studied
at Michigan or another perennial
athletics powerhouse such as
Oklahoma, Alabama or Michigan
State would have fired you a long
time ago.
What I don't understand is your
utter disregard for Michigan's
traditions. You and I are more alike
than you realize - we were both
part of the game day experience,
you as a football player and I as
a member of the band. However,
Michigan fans who had watched
you play in Bo's early years would
sense a definite difference in the
atmosphere had they attended
a recent game. The blame for
that, I believe, falls squarely on
your shoulders.
Surely you remember what it
was like to play under Bo, how the

Big House was a sacred place on
Saturdays. Without piped-in music.
Without inexplicably long media
time outs. Without advertising
galore. One of your great
predecessors, former University
Athletic Director Fielding Yost
(who originally was responsible for
obtaining the Little Brown Jug that
Michigan lost this Saturday), would
be rolling in his grave right now.
You may have heard the story in
which he called up Dr. Revelli, then
director of the Marching Band, and
chastised him for using the band to
advertise Buick on the field.
I'll put it bluntly. You're out
of touch. You don't have a clue
about what your fans, alumni and
students want. If you do, you clearly
don't care. We couldn't care less
whether we get cell phone reception
in the Big House or not. However,
students do wantto be rewarded for
their loyalty to Michigan Football.
Raising prices and instituting a
first-come-first-served seating
system last year was not the way to
do that, and it wasn't a good way to
get them to show up on time, either.
You lost roughly a third of your
student season ticket holders just to
make a bit more money.
You do deserve credit for one
thing: for turning the Athletics
Department into a very fat cash
cow. While the two-dozen plus
varsityteams are almost completely
supported by football revenue,
they were doing fine before you
came along and turned Michigan
Athletics into a business. The men's
gymnastics team probably would've
still won its back-to-back national
championships if the Athletic
department pulled in $100 million
instead of $150 million.
It's as if you make excuses to
justify bad decisions. At the end of
the day, they're still bad decisions,
and you'll see consequences

that can't be covered up. If the
attendance streak of more than
100,000 that stretches back to
1975 ends this season, how will
you explain that? When there is no
longer a waitlist for non-student
season tickets because the price
is so prohibitive and because you
alienated several years of current
students, how will you explain
that? You seem to forget the
basics of investing - that today's
students are tomorrow's season
ticket holders.
I want you to think about a very
serious question. Is selling the soul
of a 135-year-old tradition worth
any amount of money in the world?
We want football games to not
last four hours. We want to listen to
the band, not canned pop music. We
want to pay a reasonable price for
student season tickets. And we don't
want to hear about tickets sold under
face value to get more than 100,000
people to go to a game - even if the
promotion wasn't approved, what a
slap in the face to loyal fans.
We want to impatiently count
down to football season in January.
We want to be quivering with
excitement because we have tickets
to Saturday's game. We want to be
ecstatic after attending a game at
the Big House, even when we lose.
We want to inherit a tradition that
we can be proud of.
I love the University of Michigan.
If I didn't, I wouldn't have come
back for graduate school (and there
were four others who were happy
to take me). I will bleed maize and
blue until I die, and support the
football program through thick and
thin, but I cannot support you as
Athletic Director.
Forever Go Blue.

scene. Two Series
American teen Premiere
protesters
are arrested CBS
in Syria for
their anti-government activ-
ism. Cut to protagonist Eliza-
beth McCord (Tea Leoni, "Fun
With Dick and Jane") striding
through a slick college building
a thousand miles away.
The former CIA agent who
quit for ethical reasons has been
comparedto Hillary- Clinton,
yet beyond their hair color and
rapid-fire intelligence, there's
little resemblance. McCord
may also have her own share of
familiar cultural signifiers so
often found on primetime tele-
vision - blonde-haired, blue-
eyed, attractive - yet by the
first exchange with an entitled
student, it's clear McCord is a
new cut of character on TV. In
the vein of Jodie Foster, she's
got the husky voice, dry wit
and unflappable demeanor, and
when the presidential motor-
cade comes bearing her former
spy mentor/current POTUS
(Keith Carradine, "Dexter")
who wants her to step in as Sec-
retary of State, we know exactly
why he wants such a tenacious
person on his team.
Two months later, after she's
packed up her family and leaned
into D.C., McCord is stuck
approving seating arrange-'
ments for foreign dignitaries.
Unlike Clinton, McCord takes
no pleasure in these politi-

cal maneuvers, and when the
Chief of Staff (Zeljko Ivanek,
"Damages") suggests a person-
al stylist she brusquely waves
him away. That McCord would
need any fashion guidance is
wholly unbelievable; sure, she's
no flashy Olivia Pope, but we
can present a gorgeous wool
cowl-necked coat as evidence
to the contrary. Homegirl even
has time to do an artful scarf
wrap, even with more pressing
national matters like the kid-
napping of the aforementioned
junior anarchists. The work-
place scenes are peppered with
humor and showcase a wide and
diverse cast.
But beyond McCord, who
television viewers will eas-
ily root for, "Madam Secretary"
seems like it's poised to be a
spin on the well-troped D.C.-
meets-domestic drama. The
subplot of thekidnapped teen-,
agers is executed adequately'
The strength of these plots rests
on their timely prescience, in
this case the execution of three
western individuals'by IS.I.L.
in the past two months; but it's
not contributing anything new
or interesting in terms of politi-
cal commentary.
"Madam Secretary" itself.
is sanitized from any criti-
cal thought but a bland pro-.
government message, with
bureaucratic or Machiavel-
lian characters sidelined to the
peripheral channels of the insti-
tution. Do we honestly believe
all these television presidents
just genuinely want to make
real change? In the era of Hill-
ary and Bill Clinton, I want to
see more power players on the
screen who admit that they're
in it at least a little bit for the
game too. By the end of the epi-
sode McCord has saved the day,
which we knew would happen,
less because McCord is smart
and creative, and more because

we've seen this plotline many,
many times.
It does have a strong pro-
female narrative though. Just
as McCord makes ambitious,
deliberate decisions - in the
political sphere, she and her
professor husband Henry (Tim
Daly, "Private Practice") have
a seemingly modern relation-
ship - McCord would "wear
the pants in the relationship,"
if that outdated slogan has any
real bearing in the world any-
more. "Madam Secretary" also
starts from the assumption that
McCord can have the family
and the job, though it may not
always be the case. The show is
careful in examining the subtle
workplace strife that comes
from being a strong female
leader; it doesn't indict McCord
for being a "bitch" with its nar-
rative. Though it does give her
;sonehuman vulnemability - in
avdothestic scene, McCord wor-
ries to Henry that he might not
find her attractive anymore for
being "too masculine." Indeed,
I spy stormy waters in their
marital sea ahead, with the foxy,
co-eds who idolize Henry and
his theology lectures (OK now,
that's maybe the most unbeliev-
able part) forecasted to make a
late-voyage appearance.
In the end, "Madam Secre-
tary" has a so-so plot with a
great performance from Leoni.
Is it worth watching? Leoni
certainly is a deft actress, and
it's enjoyable to watch McCord
glide through the corridors of
power in a motivational kind
of way. As a criticism, we don't
really see McCord strain, which
is an odd contradiction for
my praise of it's strong female
focus, but just as we relegate
expectations of effortless con-
trol to inspirational figures like
Sheryl Sandberg, we often like
to have our television charac-
ters with a side of struggle.

'Blacklist' keeps pace

NBC show garners
impressive ratings in
season premiere
By JORDYN KAY
DailyArts Writer
Last season "The Blacklist"
proved to viewers that it's a
show filled with excitement and
intrigue, and
the premiere
of the second
season has , The Blacklist
undoubtedly
continued to Season Two
provide view- Premiere
ers with what NBC
they've come
to expect.
Coming off of its great first sea-
son, "The Blacklist" has much to
prove in its second year, and so
far, it's definitely delivered. By
asking tough questions and going
through hellfire to find answers,
the season two premiere is no
different. The episode is filled
with the usual explosions and
gunfire and, as always, viewers
are left wondering what could
possibly happen next.
Raymond "Red" Reddington
(James Spader, "The Office") is
on the hunt for yet another per-
son who is hunting him. This
time, he's still looking for Berlin
(Peter Stormare, "The Big Leb-
owski"), who was introduced
last season, and Lord Baltimore.
Red has his hands full in the sea-
son opener. He is standing by his
rules set last season, refusing to
talk to anyone in the FBI except
for agent Elizabeth Keen (Megan
Boone, "Law and Order: L.A.").
The relationship between
Keen and Reddington is the
center of the show and provides
some of the most entertaining
interactions. Keen is led to a
woman, Rowan (Krysten Rit-
ter, "Breaking Bad"), who is

NBC


That's a drug exchange handshake i we've ever seen one.

somehow connected to Lord
Baltimore. She's more connected
to Lord Baltimore than anyone
is aware of though, since she is
Lord Baltimore. Due to her Dis-
sociative Identity Disorder, even
Rowan herself is unaware of her
double identity.
"The Blacklist" is great at
shocking its audience, and the
reveal of Reddington's wife in
the premiere surely provided
the series' signature twist that
audiences have come to expect.
Reddington's wife (Mary-Louise
Parker, "Weeds") is taken hostage
by Berlin, despite Keen and the
FBI's best efforts to prevent the
kidnapping.
Reddington, who generally
remains calm under the most
intense situations, actually shows
concern for his ex-wife and seems
to be distraught. It's clear that
Red is up against one of his tough-
est and most heartless enemies
when Berlin sends Red a package
in the mail, containing one of his
ex-wife's fingers. Berlin is going
to be a test of whether Red is truly
capable of taking anyone down, as
he constantly claims he is.
The return of "The Blacklist"
leaves Agent Keen dealing with
the emotional trauma of discover-

ing her husband was an impostor
and the stress of working under
a new boss. She seems to have
channeled all her energy into her
work, and based on Berlin's ven-
detta against Red, it's a good time
for that. The episode does end
on a happy note, a much-needed
departure from the series's char-
acteristically dark tone. The task
force's director makes his return
at the end of the episode, and he is
greeted by awarm welcome.
Berlin is clearly a villain who
is here to stay, and it will be inter-
esting to see how the character
develops and how Red, Keen and
the rest of the FBI agents deal
with one of their biggest chal-
lenges yet. If the season pre-
miere is any indication of what's
to come this season, viewers can
expect exciting things. If NBC
continues to provide viewers
with fast paced, action-filled epi-
sodes such as this, "The Black-
list" will continue to garner big
ratings (it reached over 12 mil-
lion viewers for the season pre-
miere). Hopefully it keeps up this
level of intensity and exhilara-
tion, because if it does, the show
will surely continue to receive
the acclaim and praise it has
earned thus far.

"You guys on MySpace?"
'Nine-Nine' starts
sophomore season

FOX comedy
continues to thrive
off its ensemble
By DREW MARON
DalyArts Writer
"BrooklynNine-Nine"returned
in "O-some" fashion this week,
and as expected, the sophomore'
comedy still
rules. Like their A
other comedic
masterwork, Brooklyn
"Parks and Nine-Nine
Recreation,"
Dan Goor and Smson two
Michael Schur premiere
bring every Sundays at
character to a
level where any 8:30 p.m.
one of them can FOX
be your favorite.
Andy Samberg ("Saturday Night
Live") continues to shine as Jake
Peralta, showcasing enough
goofiness while remaining as
competent as you'd expect a New
York City Detective to be. And like
"Parks" 's Leslie Knope, Peralta
might be a fool, but when there's
a job to, do;he, can always be
counted on.
The season two premiere,
"Undercover," featured so many
strong lines and moments from
the whole cast, including Terry

Jeffords (Terry Crews, "The
Expendables") and Captain
Holt (Andre Braugher, "Men
of A Certain Age") performing
constant drills involving the
6'2" Jeffords masquerading as a
confused old person, a seven-year-
old boy named Timmy and a piece
of "ticking" unattended luggage.
Braugher, Emmy-nominated
for his role, continues to kill it
as Captain Holt and his back-
and-forth banter with Santiago
(Melissa Fumero, "Gossip Girl"),
Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz, "Modern
Family") and Jeffords in the
premiere is priceless.
Two of the biggest scene-
stealers of the show are Gina
Linetti (Chelsea Peretti, "Kroll
Show") and Charles Boyle (Joe Lo
Truglio, "Superbad"). Each had
their moments ofhilarity following
the harrowing (for Gina), life-
affirming (for Charles) event of
theirsleepingtogether.For Charles,
it meant a newfound confidence
in helping Jake track down an
escaped Mafioso. His insistence
on the sunhat - because that's
what he thinks a Mafioso would
wear - and his "tough guy" line,
"There's more where that came
from. I got areal-wet mouth,"all
assure Lo Truglio's Boyle to be
one of the most frequently cited
fan-favorites.
But the breakout star of the
series is Peretti's Gina. Following

her flingwith Boyle, Linetti'susual
swagger is diminished, donning
a black sweatshirt with her new
"spirit animal," the naked mole
rat, "God's disgusting mistake."
When Santiago disses the shirt,
Linetti snaps back, "Hey! Only I
get to talk about my spirit animal
that way,you don't getto say that."
But it's the delivery and Peretti's
performance - confident, self-
deprecating, deadpan and always
hysterical - that really sells the
humor.
This episode also featured
"Parks and Rec" alum Jenny Slate,
guest starring as a mafia girlfriend
whom Peralta must outwit. Given
Schur and Goor's strength in
making memorable recurring
characters, one really has to hope
that Slate and many other former
residents of Pawnee, Indiana
might also soon find themselves
at home at the 99th precinct in the
form of guest roles. (Also, please
give us a crossover episode of
"Brooklyn Nine-Nine" and "Parks
and Rec." The world will be a
better place.)
It's only the beginning of the
second season, and it's tough to
say with any certainty, but if the
jokes keeplandinglike they have
and the characters continue to
be as lovable as they are, it looks
like "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" might
indeedbe the next great television
comedy.

want to talk about the
greatest use of music in
a TV show that I have.
ever seen - season six, episode
two of "The Sopranos." Carmela
Soprano (Edie-
Falco) puts
on "American
Girl," the
'70s Classic
Rock Radio
staple by Tom
Petty and the
Heartbreak- ADAM
ers, for her THEISEN
husband
Tony, who's in
a coma after being shot.
Even if you know nothing
about the show, I think you can be
touched by watching this scene.
Falco's performance - talking
and reminiscing and working
through nostalgiathen intense
desperation then guilt and bar-
gaining while her normally fear-
some, hulking husband lies inert
with an enormous breathing tube
sticking out of his mouth - is
astounding, and when those tears
come at the end, I'm absolutely
crushed by all of her emotions. In
a series with a plethora of consis-
tently incredible moments, this,
to me, beats all the rest.
While I want to take nothing
away from Falco's, it's Tom Petty
who makes this moment. Before
I watched this scene, I thought
"American Girl" was exceed-
ingly lame, that it should sit on a
shelf gathering dust with "Slow
Ride" and "Life in the Fast Lane"
and all those other "classics"
that I guess were pretty good at
the time they were releasedbut
should probably be forgotten now.
But in this episode, the second
Carmela started playing it out
of that little radio, I knew some-
thing special was coming.
It starts innocuously, and
you're familiar enough with the
song's verses that you almost
think.ie's.goi go jasthoe back-
ground music for this grand emo-
tional scene. But no, as Carmela
starts talking about their trip to

the beach, her memories and my
memories intermingle. I think
about going to the beach with my
cousins and hearing Songs About
Jane or Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy."
And then I think about a scene
earlier in the show's run where
Carmela finds out Tony is cheat-
ing and they get into one of the
most terrifying TV arguments
I've ever seen. Or I remember
seeing Tom Petty perform this
song at the Super Bowl Halftime
Show, and then for.some reason.
this random memory of playing
Tony Hawk Pro Skater while "I
Won't Back Down" plays. Now
Carmelaand Tony are in a pool
together last season, as Carm
reluctantly realizes that she'll
never be able to get Tony out of
her life. And then I think about
my friend's lakehouse this sum-
mer, and hearing Petty's hits
being blasted from someone's
boat on the 5th of July and we're
sitting on the deck while the sun
beats down and the wind messes
up our hair. I see Carmela in the
hospital and hear classic rock and
I remember the hospital the last
time I saw my auntbefore cancer
took her while I hear her sing
Fleetwood Mac years earlier as
we play Rock Band at my house.
I want to buy into the idea that,
as fucked up as Tony and Carm's
relationship is, Tom Petty can fix
it. At its core, "American Girl" is
such a simple, lovable song. The
drum beat bounces and makes
you smile, the familiar rock struc-
ture immediately comforts and
the lyrics evoke images of per-
fectly picturesque suburban cities
where teenagers get together on
weekends to courageously flirt
with their crushes and discover
new romantic feelings that lead to,
fondly remembered embarrass-
ments. I want Carmela and Tony
to rediscover their young love just
as badly as I want Carm to just for
the love of God get out and never
talk to him again. Her words of
encouragement, her compliments
ring hollow but still I believe and
accept them.

Then the songclimaxes just
as.Carmela's love, exhaustion
and despair hit their peak. Her
voice cracks, saying "You're
coming back here," just as the
guitar soars and the wordless
backing vocals crescendo. You're
overwhelmed with everything
at once. Her tears escape and I
think about visiting relatives in
the hospital and abusive relation-
ships and all the pressures of try-
ing to be an adult but at the same
time Tom Petty's songsurprises
me with how amazing it actually
is and I hope that maybe, despite
everything, all thatshit willwork
out in the end.
The emotional power of song
is the closest thing we have to a
time machine. That's part of why
I love music. Geniuses and nov-
elty acts alike bring backthe past.
In our memories, "Summer Girls"
can be as exalted as "Mr. Tam-
bourine Man," and Toto's "Afri-
ca" can occupy the same space
as "Big Poppa." Whenever I turn
on the radio I can'be suddenly
bombarded with old fragments of
my life; when browsing through
my iPod I unconsciously have the
ability to pull back long-forgotten
times - good and bad.
The endless tree of associa-
tions that we have with music
connects us, comforts us and
fills us with more than we can
handle. And though I'm not
always thinking about all of this
when "American Girl" comes
on the radio and I use it for
pure escapism, rolling down
the windows and singing along
because I've come around to the
fact that it's a blissfully fantastic
rock song, there will also always
be those strangely wonderful
nights where it feels like every
song that comes up on shuffle has
several random half-lost moments
attached to it and I can't help but
reminisce on the people, places
and emotions the music'inspires.
Theisen is feeling sad and
nostalgic. To console him,

'Scorpion'
often ridiculous,
occasionally good
By DREW MARON
DailyArts Writer
We open on a tiny house in Ire-
land and a quaint little couple sur-
prised by three helicopters filled
with armed
soldiers. They
violently break
into the house Scorpion
and subdue the Pot
screaming hus-
band and wife. CBS
"Where is he?!"
They bark.
They make their way upstairs,
breaking into a room with their
presumed target and aim their
weapons. We then see who it
is - a small child. He claims
to have just broken into NASA.
Your response to this scene will
determine your appreciation of
"Scorpion." Years later, the little
boy is one of the five smartest
people on the planet and an ace
computer hacker named Walter
O'Brien (Elyes Gabel, "Game of
Thrones").

The opening is ridiculous and
the rest of the show isn't far off
either. If you don't have a prob-
lem with a genius hacker driv-
ing a Lamborghini 200 miles
per hour down a runway over-
a doomed plane while Katha-
rine McPhee stands through the
sunroof with a laptop connected
from the car on the ground to the
still airborne plane's computer
system, you will have a blast with
"Scorpion." If you like fast cars,
great chases, some funny char-
acter moments and not a lot of
sense, again you will like "Scor-
pion." If you were hoping this
would be director Justin Lin's big
demo reel for "True Detective"
season two ... you'll probably be
excited to find that Lin does end
up shooting the crap out of it. Lin
is known for his contributions
to the "Fast and Furious" fran-
chise and especially for making
it the awesome, globe-trotting,
over-the-top ensemble epic it's
evolved into. He's also directed
some excellent TV in recent
years including the paint-ball
episode of "Community," "Mod-
ern Warfare."
The cast is decent, and has
some definite potential, nota-
bly newcomers Ari Stidham as

"human calculator" Sylvester
Dodd and Jadyn Wong as genius
engineer Happy Quinn. For now,
the cast works and little details
like Dodd not talking to his par- I
ents in 10 years provides much-
needed pathos to some of the
more chaotic elements of the
pilot. At times, though, it does
seem like lazy writing could turn
them all into action-team stereo-
types. The pilot puts the show
in the same boat as "Fringe"
and "Agents of SHIELD" were
when they started - it could
either progress in quality or fall
aside into mediocrity. Hopeful-
ly, writer Nick Santora and his
team have enough passion for the
characters and story to let it meet
its full potential.
"Scorpion" has a lot going for
it and honestly isn't deserving of
some its more negative criticism.
The pilot might not be spectacu-
lar, but the fundamental ideas at
its core show at least some sem-
blance of potential. It's crucial
that it's a series where characters
like Sherlock Holmes and Mark
Zuckerberg truly thrive: not only
on an active runway driving 200
miles per hour, but in the infi-
nite head-space of the supposed
geniuses at its center.

RECRUITING ROUNDUP
Football commits
excel as one leaves

Lev Facher: An opportunity for
Michigan to take the next step

By JUSTIN STERN
Daily Sports Writer
With Michigan's 2-3 start
to the season, niany fans and
writers are questioning if
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke has seen the end of his days
in Ann Arbor. And the impact of
a potential firing would not only
affect the team, but it may also
result in some of Hoke's recruits
wavering in their commitments.
On Monday night, the Wolverines
saw their first decommit from
Darian Roseboro.
For the recruits that have
stayed, here's a rundown of
how everyone fared this past
weekend.

well, that
won't be a
problem for Michigan women's
basketball coach Kim Barnes
Arico.
The skipper has plenty of
talent on her hands entering
her third year at the helm
of the Michigan women's
basketball program. And as that
talentbegins to dominate the
landscape of her program, the
time is now for the Wolverines to
leap into national prominence.
Competitive windows open
and close, and apt as she is when
it comes to developing young
talent, there's no avoiding the
productive hit Barnes Arico's
team willtake after losing
seniors Shannon Smith, Nicole
Elmblad and Cyesha Goree to
graduation.
So while Barnes Arico's squad
will inevitably make forward
progress in the next three
seasons, its best opportunity to
make the leap from developing
program to annual contender
is now. The Wolverines have
a proven post presence in
Goree, one of the conference's*
scrappiest and most underrated
players in Elmblad and a senior
backcourt presence in Smith,,

entirely with their seniors,

in 2013-14. Junior Madison
Ristovski set the Michigan
single-season record for 3-point
percentage, converting on 46.6
percent of her attempts last year.
And if the hype is real, freshman
Katelynn Flaherty might be the
best shooter on the squad.
The Wolverines will need to
run and gun from long range
if they want to build upon last
year's success. Elmblad and
Goree made it clear last season
they'd never be out-worked, and
with Elmblad at small forward
and Goree at power forward, the
duo could be unstoppable.
But Michigan doesn't have
much size to workewith, or depth
at the forward position. With
6-foot-4 forward Val Driscoll
lost to graduation, Goree will
play center exclusively, pushing
Elmblad to the power forward
position. If the Wolverines are
going smaller, they'll have to go
faster and further outside.
Barnes Arico is coy when
asked whether her expectations

for this year's squad are higher.
For a program that hasn't
advanced past the second round
of the NCAA Tournament since
its inception in 1973, her long-
term expectations are high. Her
expectations are also the reason
she's in Ann Arbor, and the
reason she owns a collective .627
winning percentage in her first
two years with the program.
Of course Barnes Arico's
expectations are lofty. The
Wolverines lost less than 10
percent of their scoring and
return 87 percent of their total
minutes played from last season.
All that after the team's third
consecutive yearwith0 or
more wins, a first-time feat for
the program.
Just how high are they?
Barnes Arico wouldn't ever say,
but expectations higher than a
20-win season imply a win total
in the low to mid-20s. And a
win total in the low or mid-20s
means an NCAA tournament
berth, and maybe even a spot in a

top-25 poll at some point.
The talent is there. The
experience is there. The
shooting and speed are there too,
and there's enough depth that
Michigan's talented backcourt
can rest, run the floor, then rest
again without jeopardizing the
on-court productivity.
The coaching ability is there
too - for all the flak Athletic
Director Dave Brandon is
taking for the Michigan
football program's recent
miscues, it certainly seems he
got this one right. Barnes Arico
will be in Ann Arbor as long as
she wants.

For defense, Wolverines turn to Lohan

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
The players know it; the
coaching staff knows it: defense
is a major question mark heading
into the upcoming season.
But the question may not
be as large as the Michigan
hockey team NOTEBOOK
once thought,
thanks to the
emergence of a healthy Kevin
Lohan. After the sophomore
defenseman played just 16 games
in his freshman season due to
a right knee injury, he could be
poised to anchor the Wolverines'
top pairing. Despite the small
sample size, Michigan coach Red
Berenson believes Lohan can
develop into a top-line defender.
"I'm expecting him to be a
big, physical, defensive-minded
defenseman who we can really
trust in key situations, whether
it's on the penalty kill or against
another team's top line,"
Berenson said. "We saw glimpses
of that year, but we never saw
enough of it because he wasn't
healthy enough."
Lohan, who registered a plus-
7 rating last season, said he feels
100 percent healthy, something
Berenson said he never was last
season. And it's Lohan's health
that accounts for his optimism.
Perhaps Lohan's greatest
asset is his ability to block shots.
He blocked 23 last season, a
respectable number considering
his shortened season. Blocking
shots, though, comes with an
obvious price - gettinghurt.
"You do everything you can
to put yourself into a position to
eliminate yourself from getting
hurt, but (former defenseman)
Kevin Clare was one of the best

them slowing down.
INJURY WOES: Senior
defenseman Andrew Sinelli
remained sidelined from practice
on Monday, still recovering from
a cut on his hand from an accident
in the kitchen that became
infected and required stitches.
Berenson said Sinelli's status for
Saturday remains uncertain.
"He skated before the team did
and he's going to keep doing that,"
Berenson said. "I'd say right now
he's a big question mark heading
into the weekend. He missed all
last week with ahand injury. Right
now, he's skating on his own."
Michigan experienced a scare
during Monday's practice when
Copp went down on the ice with
what Berenson called a "stinger."
Copp was able to finish practice
and Berenson said Copp should
be good to go on Saturday.
DAY OF ATONEMENT: A

Berenson wouldn't commit to a

National Hockey League before
last season.
Trouba tallied 12 goals in an
outstanding freshman campaign,
and Berenson isn't expecting
any of his current defensemen
to mirror Trouba's stats. But it

wouldn't shock the veteran coach
if Lohan created his own success.
"I think he can become that
player," Berenson said. "That
doesn't mean you're going to get
there in a day or a week, but that's
the type of player I think he'll
evolve into."

"We know that defense is

Lohan said, "but I think we're all
confident we can get the job done
and looking forward to it."

exclusively at center last season,
including some time on the top

Institutional dysfunction
'As of Sunday, Shane was diagnosed with a probable,
mild concussion, and a high ankle sprain." - Dave Brandon

Statement from
athletic director
sent at 12:52 A.M.
"Ultimate responsibility
for the health and safety of
our student-athletes resides
with each team's coach and
with me, as the Director of
Athletics. We are committed
to continuously improving our
procedures to better protect
the health and welfare of our
student-athletes.
I have had numerous
meetings since Sunday
morning to thoroughly review
the situation that occurred
at Saturday's football game
regardingstudent-athlete Shane
Morris. I have met with those
who were directly involved
and who were responsible for
managing Shane's care and
determining his medical fitness
for participation.
In my judgment, there was a
serious lack of communication
that led to confusion on the
sideline, Unfortunately,
this confusion created a
circumstance that was not in

It is important to note that our

the systems we had in place were
inadequate to handle this unique
and complex situation properly.

share that Shane Morris suffered
an ankle injury during the third
quarter of Saturday's game. He
was evaluated for that injury
by an orthopedic surgeon and
an athletic trainer several

"We would never, ever, put a guy on the field when there's

During his weekly press
conference Monday afternoon,

They later claimed to not have
seen the impact to Morris'
head.
Brandon's statement Tuesday
morning, which apologized for
the decision and offered steps
to avoid similar mistakes in
the-future, shows the account-
ability we expected from Hoke
and the coaching staff Saturday
after the game, or Sunday in an
e-mail statement, or Monday in
the press conference.
Morris was diagnosed on
Sunday, but neither Hoke's
statement that night nor his
press conference Monday
acknowledged a head injury
was possible.
Monday, Hoke said the only
reason Morris hadn't practiced
was a high-ankle sprain.
Hoke's statement Sunday was
sent at 8:37 p.m. In it, the coach
asserted he was "confident
proper medical decisions were
made." Monday, he claimed he
didn't know if he would handle
the situation differently if it
occurred again.
Either Hoke did not know
Morris' diagnosis Sunday night
or Monday afternoon, or the
truth was not provided.
At approximately 12:45 p.m.
Monday, Hoke said he hadn't
been in contact with Brandon
about the incident.
Twelve hours later, Brandon
claimed he had "numerous
meetings" with those "who
were directly involved and who
were responsible for managing

Shane's care and determining
his medical fitness for partici-
pation."
At Monday's press confer-
ence, Hoke said he would not
wear a headset on the sideline
during games in the future. He
did not acknowledge possible
benefits the action could have
toward improving communica-
tion on the sideline.
Tuesday morning, Brandon
said the program would need to
"make important changes" to
ensure a similar situation didn't
occur again.
In his statement Brandon
said: "We are also examining
how to reinforce our sideline
communication processes and
how decisions will be made in
order to make sure that infor-
mation regarding student-ath-
lete availability to participate
is communicated effectively
amongst the medical team and
to our coaches."
Brandon's press release
explained there was a lack of
communication on the field
Saturday.
The contradictions between
the coaching staff and athletic
director demonstrate institu-
tional dysfunction within the
Athletic Department.
