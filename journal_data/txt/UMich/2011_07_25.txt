ACADEMIC R ANKINGS
Rankings
show Ross as
most costly
Tuition for
Business students
highest in country
By JESSICA TREPKA
For the Daily
Along with being the number
four ranked undergraduate busi-
ness program in the nation, the
University's Ross School of Busi-
ness also claims the number one
spot in the U.S. News and World
Report's rank of most expensive
public business schools for out-of-
state students.
Tuition for out-of-state stu-
dents is approximately $41,498 for
a BBA and $52,944 for an MBA,
according to the Business School
website. While prices may be
high, both University officials and
a student in the program say the
educational resources the school
provides outweigh the price.
Valerie Suslow, associate dean
at the Russ School of Nosiness,
said because the Business School
receives limited state funding, it's
necessary for the school to charge
a steep tuition price.
"Ross receives very limited
direct support from the state of
Michigan," Suslow said. "As such,
the Master of Business Adminis-
tration is largely meant to be self-
funded and supported by tuition
revenue, along with fundraising
and various gifts."
She said high tuition prices
are crucial in covering the lofty
expense of providing top-notch
facilities and educational resources
for students.

In light of recent
attacks, authorities
encourage students
to be cautious
By HALEY GOLDBERG
For the Daily
A recent string of assaults in
Ann Arbor has prompted the Ann
Arbor Police Department and
Department of Public Safety to
work together in order to ensure
student safety as they search

for suspects related to various
assaults in the area.
In addition to leading to
increased security measures on
campus, the assaults have also
prompted women on campus to
speak up about past incidents of
sexual assault, according to Holly
Rider-Milkovich, director of the
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center at the Universi-
ty. However, she said the series of
incidents do not necessarily repre-
sent an increase in sexual assault
rates in the community, since typi-
cally most attacks do not end up
being reported.

"While these sexual assaults
are devastating to our community,
we should not necessarily inter-
pret it as an increase in sexual
assaults because the reportingrate
for these crimes is so very low,"
Rider-Milkovich said.
She added that more sexual
assault victims have reached out to
SAPAC in recent days, which she
believes is related to the publicity
of these attacks.
"We have heard from a lot of
survivors of sexual assault in the
past week who have heard about
or read about the recent sexual

assaults and who have experi-
enced an emotional impact from
that information," Rider-Milkovich
said.
"It is certainly common for
survivors of sexual assault to expe-
rience emotional distress or poten-
tially re-live parts of their own
experience when they read about or
hear about a sexual assault happen-
ingto another."
The assaults began on July 15
at about 10 p.m., when an assailant
reportedly grabbed a 21-year-old
woman by the neck from behind
before she was able to escape,
according to Lieutenant Renee
Bush of the Ann Arbor Police
Department in an interview with
The Michigan Daily on July21.
In this particular case, the vic-
tim reported the assailant to be a
white male of medium-build, stand-
ing at 5 feet 7 inches with short,
brown hair.
The second assault happened
about an hour later on the 400

"It requires tremendous
resources to provide the best edu-
cational experience and environ-
ment for our students - such as
world-class faculty, anunparalleled
library, and outstanding career ser-
vices," Suslow said.
Suslow added that Ross is
superior to other business schools
in the country because it provides
many opportunities for leadership
development and self-assessment,
like the Ross Leadership Initiative,

block of North Division Street near
Community High School when an
assailant pulled a woman into a
dark area before she managed to
break free. According to Lieuten-
ant Myron Blackwell, the AAPD
believes this incident is connected
to a third assault that occurred at
about 2 a.m. on Greenwood Avenue
in which a DPS crime alert reported
that the assailant lifted a woman's
skirt and fondled her before she
also managed to escape.
The two victims described the
assailant in both incidences as a
male in his early twenties with an
olive complexion, standing at 5 feet
7 inches.
On July 18, two more sexual
assaults occurred. The fourth
assault, in which an assailant raped
an 18-year-old woman in an alley,
occurred at about 12:40 a.m. across
from Weill Hall near State Street.
AAPD released a composite
sketch of the perpetrator of this
attack, who is described as a white
male with brown hair and brown
eyes, standing between 5 feet 6
inches and 5 feet 10 inches.
The fifth assault, a second
which offers students real-world
experience to apply and test their
abilities.
There are also various pro-
grams - such as arts enterprise,
consulting, finance, healthcare
& life science, marketing and net
impact - offered through the Busi-
ness School that allow students to
partake in educational ventures
outside of the classroom, Suslow
said.
"Each of these pieces alone are
important," Suslow said. "Taken
together, they can transform our
students into educated, well-
rounded, grounded students who

report of rape, took place in an ele-
vator at the Liberty Square parking
structure around 10:30 p.m. on the
same day. Though this last incident
happened on Monday evening, it
was not reported until Thursday.
The final assailant is described
as a white male with short, dark
hair who stands around 5 feet 6
inches, according to an interview
with Lieutenant Renee Bush as
reported by AnnArbor.com.
In response to the string of
assaults, DPS Police Chief Joe
Piersante said the department has
responded to the attacks byincreas-
ing police presence on Central
Campus and collaborating with
AAPD to share information and
resources, accordingtoaUniversity
Record press release.
"We work as partners with the
AAPD and attempt to seamlessly
provide the services our commu-
nity members need," Piersante said.
Rider-Milkovich encourages
University community members
to call the SAPAC 24-hour sexual
assault crisis line at 734-936-3333
if they feel threatened or endan-
gered.
are ready to tackle the business
challenges that lie ahead."
Despite the high price, many
Business School students say the
cost of attending the school is a
bargain considering the innova-
tive and outstanding education the
school provides.
Business graduate student
Catherine Tamarelli said she
believes paying out-of-state tuition
will be valuable in the long run
because the skills she develops

opportunities are just several of the
benefits of attending such a presti-
gious business school," Tamarelli
said. "Leadership is probably one of
the biggest skills I've learned from
the school, which is a huge aspect
in business."
Tamarelli received her BBA as
an in-state student, but after spend-
ing two years away from Michigan,
she is now expected to pay out-
of-state tuition. Fortunately, the
difference between in-state and
out-of-state tuition as an MBA
student is not substantial, at about
$5,000, she said.

 Virtual internships allow students to work from home

State Department
offers students
an alternative to
typical internships
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
Imagine interning with diplo-
mats while simultaneously attend-
ing classes in Ann Arbor. It may
sound impossible, but a program
started by the U.S. State Depart-
ment provides students with
opportunity to dapple in virtual
internships.
Originally launched in 2009,
the Virtual Student Foreign Ser-
vice was created by the U.S. State
Department and Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton to allow
students to work with U.S. embas-
sies and consulates abroad without
leaving their homes. Such virtual
internships program can be both
beneficial for busy, ambitious col-

lege students as well incomparable
to the experience gained while
working in office, according to an
official at the University's Career
Center.
Bridget Roddy, program man-
ager of Virtual Student Foreign
Service, said the program serves
as an alternative for State Depart-
ment internships thatstudents may
be interested in.
"Secretary Clinton created the
program as a way for college stu-
dents, U.S. citizen college students,
to be involved in our State Depart-
ment's diplomatic and develop-
mental efforts," Roddy said.
The internships allow students
who can't pursue opportunities
abroad to both work for and learn
about the State Department, she
added.
"It's for students who might not
be able to do normal internships,
whether it's traveling overseas
to work with our U.S. diplomatic
posts there or traveling to Wash-
ington to work at the State Depart-
ment headquarters ... to still be able

to participate in diplomacy and still
be interested in diplomats," Roddy
said.
Geni Harclerode, coordinator
of internships and experiential
learning at the University's Career
Center, said that while there are
various benefits to having a virtual
internship, there are also draw-
backs including concern over get-
ting adequate exposure to the work
environment and working in isola-
tion as opposed to being amongst
coworkers who may provide con-
nections to future jobs. However,
she said VSFS is a venture the Uni-
versity supports.
"Certainly it would be the kind
of thing that if a student was to
come in and talk to anyone in our
office about an interest in careers
in public service, it would prob-
ably be one of a number of things
we might discuss with that student
in terms of opportunities," Har-
clerode said.
Harclerode said virtual intern-
ships are available not only from
the State Department, but also from

companies in the private sector,
adding she has noticed an increase
in internships with private com-
panies that allow students to work
from more convenient locations.
"We have seen an uptake in the
number of postings for opportuni-
ties that are organizations that are
based out of state or Ann Arbor but
are hiring students to work from
home or work from Ann Arbor or
be able to do things remotely," Har-
clerode said.
According to Roddy, as a virtual
intern students do various tasks
such as research, website building
and virtual exchanges with other
students overseas.
"Truly the program is unique in
that all the projects are self-identi-
fied by offices and by our employ-
ees, so it really varies on what the
needs of the office are and what the
office is," Roddy said.
One student from the Univer-
sity participated in the program
last year and worked with the U.S.
Consulate in Mumbai, India to aid
the Consulate with new and social

media as well as connect journal-
ists there with those in the U.S.,
according to Roddy.
Roddy added VSFS has become
larger and more competitive in
each successive year since its
inception, noting that 91 spots
were available in the second year
and this past year the number has
increased to 146. Additionally, the
program received 1,439 applica-
tions this year, an increase of 1,000
over last year, accordingto Roddy.
VSFS takes students of all years
ranging from freshmen to Ph.D.
students, Roddy said, adding that
43 percent of the 2010-2011 pool
consisted of students at the gradu-
ate level or above.
A list ofinternships is on the pro-
gram's website and all have vary-
ing requirements, some include
knowledge of a certain language or
having a level of proficiency with
different programs. The unpaid
internships run from fall 2011 to
spring 2012 and ask the "einterns"
to spend 5-10 hours per week work-
ing, according to the VSFS website.

Solar Car student team prepares to race 'Quantum'
in World Solar Challenge in Australia this October

Group traveled up
state coastline in
Mock Race to test
solar vehicle

By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Solar Car
Team's route to the World Solar
Challenge in Australia wound
through Michigan last week as the
team conducted its Mock Race in
preparation for the Challenge in
October.
Beginning on July 16, the
student-run group headed west-
ward from Ann Arbor in its newest
vehicle, Quantum, for a 1,000-mile
race along the coast of the Lower
Peninsula. Along the way, the
team coordinated its caravan of
vehicles, slept at campsites at
night, rehearsed road procedures
and practiced navigating traffic

- all tasks that race manager and
LSA senior Rachel Kramer said
the team would need to efficiently
complete in order to win the Chal-
lenge.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman lauded the Solar Car
Team at the University's Board of
Regents meeting on July 21 and
said she is anticipating success
from the student group.
"No college team has won the
international challenge in a very
long time, but if any college team
can do it, we absolutely believe that
ours can and we're very much look-
ing forward to their race," Coleman
said.
She added the team is par-
ticularly important to the Univer-
sity because it showcases students
working together to utilize the
University's wealth of technologi-
cal resources.
"The solar car team is one of
our most visible examples of team-
work, innovation and technology,"
she said.

Kramer saidthe team learned a
lot from their trial run, which cen-
tered on evaluating and improving
the reliability of the car.
"Every mile we can put on the
car with the rest of the team there
is great practice," she added.
On July 18, however, a lack of
communication within the caravan
led to the solar car hitting a pothole
and being forced to stop racing for
the day to make smallrepairs. Since
the incident, the team has pledged
to be more careful and develop new
ways to communicate hazards to
the solar car's driver, Kramer said.
"We've had practice runs
before where we go for several
hours on roads that we're familiar
with," Kramer said. "But going on
all new terrain we know that com-
munication within the caravan is
very important for the cars that are
ahead of the solar car are commu-
nicating effectively what's ahead
and even communicating small
things like potholes."
Along with communication,

Kramer said the team's strategy,
execution of race procedures and
the reliability of the car will need
to be flawless to win the Challenge,
which is renowned as the premier
international solar car competi-
tion.
The team finished third in the
2009 Challenge, and Kramer said
this year they have an advantage
over past University teams because
they believe Quantum is one of the
top solar vehicles in the world.
Unveiled in April, Quantum is
16 feet long and thirty-seven inches
tall, weighs 200 pounds less than
its predecessor - the 520-pound
Infinium - and is the most aero-
dynamic car the team has ever pro-
duced, Kramer said.
Between now and Octo-
ber, the team will be working to
refine the car and will return it to
the open road for another multi-
day race. Despite the difficulties
that lie ahead, Kramer said the
team's hopes for winning are high
because of their confidence in the

car and how it performed in the
Mock Race.
"We know we have work to do
to get there, but we've come a long
way," Kramer said. "So there's still
optimism there, and we know that
we're going to work incredibly
hard because it's definitely not easy
to get to that place. But we're feel-
ing pretty good."
Kramer added she and the
rest of the team understand the
difficulty of winning the Chal-
lenge - a feat no American team
has achieved since General Motors
won the inaugural race in 1987
with the GM Sunraycer.
"It would be a huge mile-
stone for Michigan, knowing that
twenty years of teams before our
team have worked for this goal,
and to reach it would be incred-
ible," Kramer said. "It'd be a great
accomplishment, not just for the
people who are on the team now
but for all of the alumni and fans
and supporters who have followed
us all the way through."

Raise the roof
Debt ceiling shouldn't be used as a political tool
The nation's debt ceiling is looming on the horizon, and
as the U.S. moves closer to default there is little reas-
surance from Capitol Hill. The U.S. is already in the
throes of financial crisis, and the mere threat of not extend-
ing the debt ceiling is causing economic instability. Congress
needs to arrive at an agreement on spending, taxes and a new
debt ceiling that doesn't only push the problems a few months
down the road. Both Republicans and Democrats may have
to make ideological sacrifices for a compromise - but with a
national default as the alternative, a deal must be reached.

Last week, the Daily published an
article entitled "Police work to make
campus safer for students." The title
of the article is correct. The police are
quite effective and laudable for their
work in protecting our community.
None the less, I find some of the DPS
statements in the article disturbing.
At many points in the article, DPS
is represented as having the attitude
that crimes are in part the victim's
fault. For example, DPS spokes-
woman Diane Brown is quoted as
saying "Many of the assaults really
are equally blamed on both sides."
The author of the article summa-
rizes the spokesperson's comments
by saying that "Ultimately, (the
spokesperson) said the issue lies in
personal responsibility of University
members in following the suggested
safety measures."
For a few reasons, DPS taking this
stance is antithetical to the goal of
having a safe community - the pri-
mary goal of DPS. Regardless of who
is actually to blame for these crimes,
I hope DPS will avoid adopting this
kind of stance in the future.
I brought these concerns to the
spokeswoman for DPS last week,
and she brought to my attention that
her comments were made before and
were not meant to apply to the recent
sexual assaults near campus. While I
appreciate this clarification, my con-
cerns apply to DPS's attitude toward
all crimes against community mem-
bers, regardless of their severity.
If members of the community
thought DPS blamed the victims in
part for crimes, they are less likely to
feel that DPS is on their side in keep-
ing the community secure. This is
likely to result in community mem-
bers being less cooperative with DPS
in ways that are detrimental to the
operations of DPS and the safety of
our community as a whole. A woman
who has been assaulted, for example,
may fail to report the assault if she
feels that it's her fault. As we know
from the National Crime Victimiza-
tion Survey, many acts of violence
(against women, in particular) go
unreported, and a plausible expla-
nation of part of that is the victim
incorrectly feels like it is her fault.
By making the kinds of statements

quoted in the article, DPS seems to
be reinforcing this attitude.
Further, by instilling the attitude
that victims are in part to blame for
the crimes, DPS seems to be suggest- 4
ing that we shouldn't rely on them
for our security. They instill the idea
that because each person is alone in
guaranteeing their safety, they are
to blame for a crime. But as we learn
from Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and
Rawls, we're better off entering into
social arrangements, like forming
DPS, so that we may work together
as a whole community to secure our
mutual safety. By expressing the
attitude that it is each person for
himself or herself, DPS seems to be
renouncing its role in that plan.
Finally, by suggesting that it is
in part the victim's fault, DPS sup-
presses the kind of creative and
venturesome spirit that character-
izes the Ann Arbor community. The
reason we want a safe and secure
society in the first place is so that we
may go about our business, learning
and living without being paralyzed
by concerns of personal and prop-
erty safety. The attitude expressed
by DPS in the article suggests that
for a member of the community to 4
be safe, they should not engage in
some activities in which they may
otherwise reasonably engage. A
community member who wants to
leave their apartment to skip around
downtown listening to music on
their earphones shouldn't. feel like
they cannot because they're risking
their personal safety. By DPS tell-
ing someone that it is their fault that
they are violated, DPS is essentially
telling them to stay home. This is the
same kind of chilling effect that ter-
rorism has on a community.
I applaud the continuing efforts
of DPS in trying to secure our com-
munity, butI hope that it will recon-
sider the public stance it takes in the
future. Suggesting ways in which we
may better secure ourselves is help-
ful, but suggesting that crimes occur
because we fail to follow the advice
is contrary to the goal of having a
safe community.

Congress has taken advantage
of the necessity of the debt ceil-
ing's extension to make their
political desires a reality. Rather
than responding to the issue
of entitlement reform or other
spending issues with appropri-
ate democratic measures, the
debt ceiling is being used as
leverage to force major changes.
The spendingthat is pushingthe
U.S. closer to the debt limit was
provisioned and passed by Con-
gress in the past, and Congress
can make changes to spending
in the future. A reform of this
spending does not need to be
rushed by the current debt limit
deadline. Adjustments to bor-
rowing, spending and revenue
must be made carefully, without
the weight of the debt ceiling
pushing down on the process.
Unfortunately, Republicans
remain steadfast in their refusal
to raise the ceiling, so negotia-
tions must go forward.
Both House Speaker John
Boehner and many Republi-

cans in Congress are demand-
ing massive expenditure cuts,
mainly along the lines of enti-
tlements, and many of their
concerns are legitimate. Social
Security certainly needs to be
revamped and current govern-
ment spending is growing to
precarious levels. The debate
between Boehner and President
Barack Obama has been going
on for some time, but little
progress has been made. It's not
that there has been a paucity of
deals or solutions being offered,
but simply an unwillingness
to compromise. While some
Republicans are interested in
making deals with the Demo-
crats across the aisle, Boehner
is not one of them.
The problem with the discus-
sions between Boehner and the
White House is that he refuses to
tackle the national deficit from
the other side - with revenue
increases. Raising taxes would
doubly improve the deficit issue
and help the nation grapple with

its current financial woes. But
Boehner refused on all counts
to raise tax rates, even though
Obama pledged to trim Medi-
care, Medicaid and Social Secu-
rity. It's hard to imagine how
a deal could be reached with
Republicans giving so little.
As attempted parleys between
Obama and Boehner continue to
fail, the debt debate will most
likely be resolved in Congress.
Boehner and Congressional
Republicans shouldn't con-
tinue to wield the debt ceiling
as a weapon. Reforms must be
made, but the Republican's cur-
rent strategy is far too volatile.
Their muscling puts the coun-
try's recovery at risk and may
prevent both Republicans and
Democrats from getting what
they want. No matter what
happens, the debt ceiling must
receive an extension. And if a
spending deal is required to
do it, an effective one would
include compromise and con-
cessions from both parties.

Recently, the Department of
Public Safety issued three campus
safety crime alerts to inform Uni-
versity of Michigan community
members of sexual assaults near
the campus. While these types of
stranger assaults are not common
on our campus or in Ann Arbor,
members of our community may
have concerns about their safety or
may have experienced emotional
distress related to reading news
stories about the crimes.
It is important to remember that
while sexual assaults do occur on
the U-M campus, the vast major-
ity of those assaults occur between
two people who know each, rather
than by a stranger. Research con-
ducted by the National Institute
of Justice and the Department of
Justice tells us that 90 percent of
college students who experience
sexual assault on campus know
their perpetrator as a classmate,
a friend, a significant other, or an
acquaintance.
In order to reduce sexual
assaults on our campus, we must
focus on translating our shared
institutional commitment to "cre-
ate and maintain a respectful
and inclusive environment that
provides the support and oppor-
tunity necessary for each mem-
ber of our community to prosper
and achieve" into effective action
when we see opportunities for
potential harm. Violence preven-
tion experts refer to this strategy
as "bystander intervention." We
think of it as looking out for each
other and taking responsibility
to help if we encounter troubling
situations or if someone is doing
something to or with another per-
son that just doesn't feel right.
While the actions we take will
change from person to person
and from situation to situation, if
we each commit to moving from
watching with concern to taking
action, we will make our com-
munity safer and bring to life our

Michigan values ofcivility, dignity,
diversity, education, equality, free-
dom, honesty and safety. Until that
time comes we have a responsibil-
ity to survivors of sexual assault to
listen to them, believe what they
are saying, support them in ways
that they choose and connect them
to the resources they need to heal.
The Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center (SAPAC)
is available 24 hours a day, seven
days a week through our Crisis
Line (734-936-3333). SAPAC pro-
vides support and assistance to
survivors of sexual assault, inti-
mate partner violence, sexual
harassment, and stalking in the
U-M community. Our services also
are offered to the family members,
and supporters of survivors. We
offer individualized crisis inter-
vention and academic, legal and
medical advocacy.
We provide survivors with
information to help them make
informed choices and we sup-
port survivor healing. U-M com-
munity members also may make
an appointment to mget with an
advocate in person by calling 734-
998-9368. Everyone is welcome to
stop byour office to speak with our
advocate on call Monday-Friday, 9
a.m.-5 p.m. SAPAC's office is locat-
ed at 715 N. University Ave., Suite
202 on the second floor.
If you have additional con-
cerns, would like more informa-
tion, or simply want to talk about
your experience, SAPAC is here
for you. As we approach our 25th
year of service to U-M students,
SAPAC is committed to promot-
ing healthy relationships, teaching
non-violence and equality and sup-
portingsurvivor healing. Together
we will foster a respectful and safe
environment for all members of
the University of Michigan com-
munity.

A couple of weeks ago a col-
league at the Daily sought to cap-
ture our generation's zeitgeist by
lightly com-
paring us to a
rapper, call-
ing us "Kids of
Cudi." The title
of the column
stuck with me.
I thought the
theme of the NICK
article was a BRINGARDNER
sweeping gen-
eralization,
and a rather discouraging one. We
shouldn't try to be the kids of Cudi,
entitled young people consuming in
excess. We can do better than that.
If anything, we should strive to be
the sons and daughters of T-Pain.
If you think about it, T-Pain is
the ultimate badass. If Andy Sam-
berg could choose only two peo-
ple to accompany him on a free
boat ride, T-Pain would be one of
those people. In the big single that
launched his career, "Buy You A
Drank," he assumed we knew him
before he was even really popu-
lar, saying, "I'm T-Pain, you know
me..." Well, it doesn't matter if we
knew him before the song because
we certainly know him now. He's a
hugely successful recording artist,
and although the title of his first
album, Rappa Turnt Sanga, might
confuse some, he can actually sing.
T-Pain knows how to play the
game. First, he added Auto-Tune
pitch correction to his voice, which
was (and still kind of is) the fad in
hip hop and other popular music. It
became his signature and his name
is synonymous with the effect. It
propelled him to superstardom,
so much so that he got in bed with
Apple and created an app called "I

Am T-Pain," a portable Auto-Tune
apilication. Rather than advertis-
ing that the program will auto-
tune your voice, it says it grants
you the privilege of sounding just
like T-Pain. Forget what you think
about all the people who bought
the app - or what that says about
our generation - T-Pain is mak-
ing a lot of money from it. Rappers
nowadays get their hands on all
types of entrepreneurial endeav-
ors. Mogul is a word commonly
used now for rappers like Jay-Z,
50 Cent and Nelly, who, while con-
tinuing to produce music, seek to
broaden their horizons by creating
their own record labels, owning
restaurants and basketball teams,
or developing fragrances and cloth-
ing lines. They're finding success
through several business ventures,
which is commendable no matter
how you look at it.
We should all be more like
T-Pain. And it's not just because he
stacks paper to the ceiling and gets
honeys. No. He, like so many other
rappers and performers, is living
his dream of being an entertainer.
He went after what he wanted and
got it. Unfortunately, many would
see his success as selling out, dress-
ing ridiculously and producing
subpar music. However, I don't,
view changing one's image solely
as conforming. In some cases, it
can be more like rebirth, redefining
oneself according to his or her own
choices.
With shrewdness similar to
Lady Gaga, T-Pain is able to do
whatever he wants and act howev-
er he wants to attract fans. He has
carefully crafted his image to get
attention because attention earns
him money. And I don't know why
people are so quick to denounce

his music as trash. Has every art-
ist in the history of music produced
instant classics? Certainly not.
Plus, I bet you can't avoid bopping
your head and moving your feet to
his song's catchy beats. And to be
quite honest, that's more or less the
point of the music.
He went after
what he wanted
and he got it.
There's nothing wrong with
trying to be more like a rapper.
T-Pain's not a caricature of some
silly rapper stereotype and he's
not an inept hack pawning off hor-
rible music. Nope, he's successful.
Maybe rappers and performers like
him are consuming in excess with
fast cars and fast women, but they
certainly earned it first. Whether
we think they deserve it or not is
irrelevant. The Kids of Cudi come
from their middle to upper-class
environments without any regard
for who earned that money, who
provided them with that lifestyle.
Sons and daughters of T-Pain seek
to innovate within the structure of
the game, carving out a niche for
themselves and finding success on
their own terms. The ubiquitous
"rags to riches" stories within the
rap community are actually good
examples of how ambition can get
you anywhere you want to go. So
don't hate, emulate.

*New vintage shop opens on East Liberty Street

Avtomobile offers
residents homemade
and vintage goods
By JULIA
SMITH-EPPSTEINER
ManagingArts Editor
Sandwiched between Kolos-
sos Printing and Vahan's Clothing
& Tailoring on East Liberty Street
lays a new vintage shop called
Avtomobile, abound with flowers,
heaps of one-of-a-kind clothing
pieces and original sketch art.
20-year-old owners Maris
Turner and Sara Renner said Avto-
mobile - pronounced Automobile
- isn't focused on specific eras or
appealing to costume parties like
other vintage stores in the area,
but is instead intended to provide
Ann Arbor with "everyday vintage
* wear."
The duo met at Columbus
College of Art and Design where
Turner studied illustration and
Renner studied fashion design.
After working and interning at
both Abercrombie & Fitch and

American Eagle, Renner said they
were both ready to move on and
start their own business.
"There's a lot of these kind of
stores in New York, but Ann Arbor
doesn't have it so it's a new, fresh
thing that I feel like,is cool that
we're introducing to the people
here," Renner said. "We want it to
be wearable."
She added that in addition to
being wearable, the clothing is
well priced and one-of-a-kind - all
clothing items are either original
graphic tees by Turner, tops sewn
from scratch, altered vintage piec-
es designed by Renner or "straight
vintage," according to Renner.
"We want to make sure it's
what our taste is, what we like,"
she said. "We want to eventually
have our own brand and have it all
be our own line and have vintage
intersected inside of it instead of
being just vintage. We want it to be
our own identity."
Both Turner and Renner also
replenish their clothing supply
by shopping for new items every
Monday and Tuesday at various
places in both Michigan and Ohio,
and eventually they hope to travel

to other areas in search of new vin-
tage items.
"We'll go to thrift stores, we'll
go to antique shops, my mom's
bringing me stuff from Ohio,"
Renner said. "We'll go up state in
Michigan like Traverse City, and
on highways there's just random
antique places, like trailers and
stuff, that we just love digging
through. Eventually we want to go
back to New York and go to our hit
spots there."
Renner said she and Turner
strategically opened Avtomobile
in conjunction with the Ann Arbor
Art Fair that was held July 20-22
in order to spread the word about
their opening and hopefully gar-
ner more business.
"The Art Fair has really
brought a lot more traffic," Renner
said. "Because it's such a kind of
hidden little nook, it's helped bring
a lot of traffic ... a lot of artists, a lot
of young kids, which is more of our
demographic - the college student
or young professional."
The owners said they are excit-
ed about their location on East
Liberty Street and look forward to
being amongst the already estab-

lished surrounding vintage shops
in Ann Arbor. Despite the compe-
tition, the pair said they believe
each store provides a different
style and personality, causing less
competition than anticipated.
Emilie Parker, manager of
Ragstock - located a block from
Avtomobile - echoed Renner and
Turner's sentiment and said that
each store has their own special-
ized style, minimizing potential
drawbacks from the competition
of having multiple stores in the
area.
"I think overall it's going to be
good for the area because it'llbring
more retail traffic down this way,"
Parker said. "And I think that's
something that's definitely been
needing to happen because there's
so much stuff up on State Street
but down this way, in between
State and Main, there just hasn't
been a lot."
Kelly McLeod, co-owner of
The Getup on State Street, said she
"really encourages" the opening
of vintage stores as a whole and
thinks providing students with
various locations is advantageous
to their personal shopping ven-

tures.
"I think my favorite cities like
Austin, Texas, parts of New York
and Chicago are my favorite cities
because there are multiple vintage
stores to shop at and it becomes a
destination," McLeod said. "And
I think if there were more plac-
es like that around here, it only
encourages the vintage commu-
nity to grow here."
Renner and Turner said they
are pleased with the way their
store has turned out thus far and
don't desire to expand or open
multiple locations. However, they
eventually want to become more
accessible - especially for the
winter months when there is less
foot traffic - by making their mer-
chandise available online, Renner
said.
She added that she hopes the
shop becomes more than just
another downtown store for Ann
Arbor, and will serve as a busi-
ness that impacts the community
"rather than being like a Starbucks
on every corner."
"We want people to go out of
their way to come see us," Renner
said.

'Breaking Bad'
breaks the mold

"No, the 'A' does not stand for asshole!"
Aye, aye 'Captain'

Marvel infuses heart
and soul into 'The
First Avenger'
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Senior Arts Editor
Captain America shouldn't
work in the 21st century, neither
as a comic book character nor
as an action
movie hero.*
Alongside his
superhuman C
abilities, he's
super demure, America: Te
super whole- First Avenger
some and
idealistic to At Quality16
the point of and Rave
naivety - a
propagandis- Patamoant
tic product of
the 1940s that doesn't fit in today's
jaded, post-ironic, post-everything
world. But look around at America
nowadays - embroiled in three
unpopular wars and facing a debt
crisis machinated by politicians
more concerned with their own
futures than the country's - and
the entrance of Captain America
and his unsullied righteousness
into the public's consciousness
has never been more appropriate.
And that's just the character - in
our grim cinematic climate, where
summer blockbusters are defined
by CGI running reckless with
abandon, the old-school filmmak-
ing of "Captain America: The First
Avenger" is exactlywhatthe indus-
try needs right now.
The great, creative victory of
"Captain America," brought to you

by the quality-cognizant execu-
tives at Marvel Studios, was stick-
ing to the character's true origins
and setting the film in the midst of
World War II. It was a time when
bad was bad, good was good, and
the best of them was Steve Rogers
(Chris Evans, "Push"), a scrawny
kid from Brooklyn with the eye of
the tiger, the heart of a lion and the
physical prowess of a 12-year-old
child. For his intangibles, Rogers
is chosen as the prototype for the
government's "Super-Soldier" pro-
gram, which transforms him into,
well, a super soldier destined to lay
the smackdown on those damn,
dirty Germans.
Yes, those dastardly Nazis are
at it again (technically an uber-
evil faction of them), making this
a retro story in the best sense of
the word, filmed in an exception-
ally retro way. Director Joe John-
ston, who was the art director for
"Raiders of the Lost Ark," per-
missibly cribs from Indy's great-
est adventure with minimal use
of CGI, elaborate sets and grandly
choreographed action sequences
that graciously subvert the trend of
shooting action like a chimpanzee-
on-crack-with-a-camera would.
When Captain America thwaks
fools with his star-spangled shield,
every millisecond of the combat is
seenin all of its full-throttled glory.
Old-fashioned action has never felt
so refreshing.
Marvel movies have an uncanny
ability to fill out its cast with Hol-
lywood's finest character actors,
and for the first time, the pres-
ence feels justifiable. "Captain
America" struts out Tommy Lee
Jones ("The Fugitive") and Stan-
ley Tucci ("The Lovely Bones"),

who bring their standard gravitas
to pivotal roles, peppering the film
with quality quips. Hugo Weaving
("The Matrix") plays the Red Skull
of every neck-bearded comic book
fan's dreams, seething menace, but
creating a whole new monster than
his iconic Agent Smith.
The Red Skull's quest for global
dominance with his secret weapon
is where the film notably falters.
It's a fairly nonsensical plot device
that is never acceptably explained,
severely diminishing the stakes
throughout the movie. But the
stakes are stabilized by the ter-
rific love story between Rogers
and Peggy Carter (Hayley Altwell,
"The Pillars of the Earth") the va-
va-voom British soldier who does
her part to make the phrase "dam-
sel in distress" obsolete. Evans
brings a lot to what is essentially
a perfect depiction of Captain
America, and his earnest relation-
ship with Peggy is one of the best.
among all comic book adaptations.
As the final tile in the Marvel
movie mosaic, and though it clear-
ly sets up for next year's team-up
"The Avengers," "Captain Ameri-
ca" stands on its own. As enjoyable
as "Iron Man" and "Thor" were,
"Captain America" is the only one
of the lot with the heart and soul
characteristic of the Avengers'
leader.
When asked why he wants to
fight, Steve Rogers responds, "I
don't like bullies," reflecting the
unequivocal steadfastness of the
United States in the '40s. Now,
70 years later, global perception
is clear that we've become those
bullies. If we want to change as a
country, we're all going to have to
find a little captain inside of us.

Pitchfork serenades Chicago Annual A2 Arts Fair

ByJOSHUA BAYER
Daily Arts Writer
Not many music festivals can
tout that their three-day passes
sold out within 24 hours of the ini-
tial sales date. But of 2011, Pitchfork
Music Festival can. In the realm of
indie hipster fandom, Pitchfork is
incontestably the "it" music festi-
val.
Just look at the lineup - no other
US festival of comparable notori-
ety would ever have the audacity
to flaunt Animal Collective, Fleet
Foxes and TV On The Radio as its
three premier headliners. While
Pitchfork's marquee bands may
possess tremendous clout in terms
of critical acclaim and devout cult
followings, they lack the power-
house mass appeal of, say, Eminem,
Foo Fighters, Coldplay and Muse
(the chief headliners of this year's
Lollapalooza, also held in Chicago).
But according to Mike Reed,
director of Pitchfork Music Fes-
tival, the event's palpable "small-
ness"is anythingbutacompromise.
In fact, the festival was originally
" slated as a juice-up incarnation of
the sorts of homely summer street
festivals that are immensely popu-
lar in Chicago.
"You have these street festivals,
there's a bunch of them all over the
place," Reed said in an interview
with The Michigan Daily. "But
they're just basically a beer bash,
more or less. There's a stage and
there's people selling crap. Most of
(the festivals) would have, like, bad
cover bands or maybe a blues band,
you know, maybe a tribute band ...
and my thought was, 'wouldn't it be
great if you had something like this
but it was actually good music?"'
Little did Reed know, the festival
would blow up into somewhat of an
enigma - the most monolithically
mod festival in America, despite
its relative lack of star power, real
estate and financial resources.
"Once you get compared to some
of those larger festivals ... they
actually are four or five times larg-
er than you, with that much more
means on every level," Reed said.
"We put up the event in three days
and tear it down in ten hours. We
don't have weeks to build it outside
in Manchester, Tennessee."
While there's an undeniable
charm to the dirt-caked, shower-
less experience that the hardcore
campout festivals promise, Pitch-
fork offers a far more comfortable

withstands the heat

Pitchfork 2011 had three headliners, including Animal Collective, yictured ahove.

alternative.
"Usually, I'm not a huge fan of
festivals," said Johan Duncanson,
frontman and guitarist of Pitch-
fork 2011 band The Radio Dept., in
a Skype interview from Sweden. "I
used to go to a lot of festivals whenI
was a kid, and I always came home
like extremely dirty and hung over.
And I've heard that this festival is
cleaner."
Pitchfork's heavily discount-
ed price tag is a selling point as
well: It's $110 for a weekend pass,
which is favorably compared to an
upper limit of $249.50 or $215.00
for Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza,
respectively.
"If you wanted tosee TV On The
Radio, it might cost you 30 bucks,
with an opener," Reed said. "(At
Pitchfork), you get to see TV On
The Radio with like 10 openers.
And it's 45 bucks."
Moreover, Pitchfork's scaled-
down size allows for optimal
absorption of its artists' sets. Rath-
er than pitting five star-studded
stages against each other all at
once, the festival features two main
stages directly next to each other
(when a show on one stage stops,
another show begins almost imme-
diately on the opposite stage), with
a third stage thrown in for some
variety.
"At a lot of (festivals), you pay for
things that you would never even
have a chance to see," Reed said.
"And here, you get to see 70 percent
of what you're paying for."
If one truly wants to, he or she
can catch a significant portion of
literally every single set at the fes-
tival. Reed describes Pitchfork as
a "boutique" - a triumphant dis-
play of the hottest up-and-coming
bands on the underground music
circuit. Rather than focusing on
booking more established indie

acts, Pitchfork's primary intent is
to "break" bands with unrecog-
nized talent.
"We were the only festival (Fleet
Foxes) played back in 2007," Reed
said. "I mean,theywere completely
unknown ... that fall they were on
Saturday Night Live."
John Famiglietti, member of2011
Pitchfork band HEALTH, offers a
first-hand account: "When we got
asked to play Pitchfork (in 2009),
we came fromtotal DIY. Like, right
before that we were touring fuck-
ing basements in America and liv-
ing rooms and stuff."
Inextricably linked with the
online music publication of the
same name, Pitchfork Music Festi-
val represents the upper echelon of
the industry's underdogs.
"We never got to do the festi-
vals in our day," said Eric Axel-
son, bassist of recently reunited
Dismemberment Plan, a Pitchfork
2011 band that was somewhat of a
cult sensation in the late '90s. "We
never got to play, like, the Lollas or
the ACLs."
The Pitchfork afternoons were
fairly chilled-out displays of sonic
iconoclasts peppered in with some
particularly memorable sets (tUnE-
YarDs and Kurt Vile took the cake
this year), but the evenings were
absolutely breathtaking. Animal
Collective's set design alone, fea-
turing an onslaught of orange-
and-white paper bats and a giant,
monitor-laden face fashioned from
kaleidoscopic shards of glass, was a
cause for unbridled jubilation.
"I think Pitchfork is associated
with a certain kind of cool factor,"
said Dimitri Coats, guitarist of 2011
Pitchfork band OFF!. "And I think
people that are going to the festi-
val are probably expecting to be
exposed to somewhat of a cutting
edge."

As the weather catapulted from
mildly irritating to catastrophi-
cally hot, the annual Ann Arbor
Art Fair rolled into town, bring-
ing with it a motley crew of indi-
viduals. The only warning the
sleepy and sweaty city had was
the array of tents that sprung up
where busy intersections had
been just moments before.
Wednesday morning, while
locals were busy re-routing their
commutes to work and curs-
ing the unavoidable road blocks,
flocks of people gathered on the
now-tented streets. With deter-
mination and a fierce eagerness,
people began to walk the streets
in search of good sales, fun knick-
knacks or simply because it had
become a tradition.
"We've been coming to the Art
Fair for years," said Kelly Farrell,
mother of four and resident of
South Bend, Ind. "I never know
what I'm looking for until I find
it. I think that's the beauty of the
fair. There's really something for
everyone."
The Art Fair boasts more than
1,100 artists and hundreds of thou-
sands of visitors walk the streets
of Ann Arbor, peeking into booths
and shying away from direct sun-
light. As Farrell noted, it's the ver-
satility of the Art Fair's products
that peaks the interest of many.
"It's like Christmas in July!"
said Monica Farrell, one of the
children with Kelly.
"I'm here with four kids. And
my sister, she has three," Farrell
said. "That's a lot of work, and
in this sun ... it's difficult, but we
don't miss it. I told the kids, 'you'll
just have to get all your whining
out of the way. We've got a long
day ahead of us."'
Farrell was not the only one
confronting the heat. Many
guests, feeling the weight of the
humidity, ushered into local food
joints and air-conditioned stores
in search of solace from the sun.
"The amount of people is awe-
some." said Anya Parampil, Ann
Arbor resident and Orchid Lane
employee hired for the Art Fair
rush. "It's really energetic and
lively everywhere. Even though
it's really hot outside, people still

feel like they can come in to local
stores and shop there. It's nice."
Businesses benefit greatly from
the annual open-air art extrava-
ganza. Hotels, restaurants, park-
ing lots and commercial stores
are all intertwined with the four
day mega-fair, profiting from the
large amounts of people that come
through Ann Arbor.
"We get a lot of people coming
in, being amazed at everything we
have," Parampil said. "It's good
for business, especially since Ann
Arbor is essentially dead in the
summer. It's been really fun get-
ting to know some people from
out of Michigan too. It's like a
little cultural experience!"
Over 1,100
artists took to
the streets.
Whether people were inter-
ested in paintings, fine jewelry,
specialty corks for wine bottles
or signing a petition for a nudist
beach, they could find it at the art
fair. Crowds meandered happily
from booth to booth, appreciating
the art, sunshine and the simple
pleasure of each other's company.
Of course, not everyone was
left as satisfied as the fair-goers.
Locals seemed less than thrilled
at the change of pace in town.
"I'm taking a summer class so
this interferes with my parking. I
have to wake up 30 minutes earli-
er!" said Jacob Williams, LSA stu-
dent and enthusiast of all things
not art fair. "It's inconvenient."
Along with time constraints,
Williams felt disappointed with
the circumstances. He added sar-
castically: "I'm really glad it's this
hot. It makes it so much better."
Although flecked with mild
inconveniences for the locals, the
Art Fair has long been one of the
greatest anticipations in the sum-
mer months, and this year it did not
disappoint. Saturday night ended
with a mass of happy, sun burnt
people examining their purchases
and eagerly awaiting next year's
fair.

2011 Football Season Preview: Defensive Line

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
* Daily Sports Editor
With the 2011 season just weeks
away, Michigan defensive coordi-
nator Greg Mattison's first order
of business is to right the Wolver-
ines' defensive corps - a veritable
*sinking ship.
That overhaul began the
moment Mattison stepped on
campus, announcing Michigan's
return to a standard 4-3 scheme.
And with inexperience across the
board on defense, Mattison will
rely heavily on the defensive line.
At first glance, it's a rather fear-
some foursome on the front lines
for Michigan. And it is - all four
projected starters were once four-
or five-star recruits.
But, still, they are an unproven
cast. The top four names on the
depth chart - defensive ends
Ryan Van Bergen and Craig Roh
and defensive tackles Mike Martin
and Will Campbell - are identical
to what Michigan fans expected to
*see begin the 2010 season.

But with then-defensive coor-
dinator Greg Robinson's switch to
the 3-3-5 formation, things were
thrown into limbo. Roh spent a
good deal of time as an oversized
linebacker, seeing minimal suc-
cess on the field. And Campbell,
a junior who played on both sides
of the ball as a standout at Cass
Tech, was pulled across the line
for stints at offensive guard.
Just like that, the front line of
Michigan's defense was just as
shaky as the rest. The Wolverines
tallied just 18 sacks all season -
Van Bergen led the way with four.
In comparison, NCAA lead-
ers Florida State and Boise State
gathered 48 sacks. And Clem-
son's Da'Quan Bowers trailed just
behind the entire Wolverine squad
with 15.5 sacks of his own.
Ouch. Add that the defense
allowed an average of 450 yards
per game - nearly 190 of those
yards were earned on the ground
- and Michigan's startling 35.2
points allowed per game and it's
not hard to see why Robinson isn't

gearing up for another season as
defensive coordinator.
But though Robinson was
shown the door, most of the line-
man - and all of the starters -
have returned. And Michigan's
success in 2011 depends on wheth-
er Mattison can complete the
defense's turnaround.
Redshirt senior defensive end
Ryan Van Bergen returns as ateam
captain for Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's first year at the helm. Van
Bergen played on both the end and
on the interior, but with a pair of
capable defensive tackles, Van
Bergen should give valuable expe-
rience coming off the edge.
A talented end from Scottsdale,
Ariz., Roh will shore up the other
end of the line. To put it simply,
Roh is hoping to forget his lack-
luster sophomore season. After
accumulating 35 tackles and a
pair of sacks as a freshman, Roh's
shift to hybrid linebacker/defen-
sive end curbed his growth as a
pass rusher. He finished with just
43 tackles and a half sack in a full
slate of starts in 2010.
While Van Bergen is a captain,
Martin is the unquestioned leader
of the pack on the defensive line.
A 2010 All-Big Ten second team
selection, Martin made the deci-
sion to return for his senior season
in Ann Arbor rather than chase an
NFL career.
Martin's effectiveness was
severely hindered - especially
during Big Ten action - when a
mid-season ankle injury hurt his
explosiveness and affected the
powerful leverage he uses to beat
the double teams he routinely
faces. Taking the pressure off
Martin will be key, and Mattison
already showed part of his plan
during the Spring Game when he
stunted Martin off the edge as a
hybrid linebacker.
Don't expect to see that often,
but it's an option to get Martin a
clean look at the quarterback. The
move had quite the positive effect.
"It's another thing offenses
have to watch film on," Van Ber-
gen said after the Spring Game.
"You'll see a nose guard at 300
pounds, coming off the edge in a
two-point - good luck."
"Man, he's a great athlete,"
junior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson added, his eyes widening.
"So whenever I see him, I'm like,
'Man, I've gotta watch where he's
coming from.' "
But the ability to move Martin
around hinges on Campbell's con-

Pumford joins 'M'
staff as assistant

Former Michigan
standout returns to
Ann Arbor
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Coming from a big, competi-
tive family, coaching had always
intrigued Nick Pumford.
He marveled at the impact that
Bo Schemblecher and John Wood-
en had on their players' lives and
was motivated to positively impact
his own group of young players
some day.
Pumford already accomplished
his goal of becoming a coach last
year when he was hired by Geor-
gia State. But after Michigan men's
golf coach Chris Whitten asked
Pumford join the staff in Ann
Arbor and become the new assis-
tant golf coach, Pumford will now
be able to do what he loves at his
alma mater.
"It's a dream come true," Pun-
ford said. "It's such a special place
and it really is a place close to my
heart. I spent a lot of time at Michi-
gan, and just to be able to come
back and to be a part of the Michi-
gan family, it's just really exciting."
Though young in age, the former
Wolverine standout brings a lot of
experience to the coaching staff.
He helped Michigan earn back-
to-back NCAA regional selections
in 2008 and 2009 after an eight-
year postseason absence for the
program. As a senior co-captain in
2009, he spearheaded Michigan's
run to the NCAA Championships,
the team's first appearance in 12
years. There, Pumford helped the
Wolverines surprise everyone with
a third-place finish.
After a successful career at
Michigan, Pumford briefly played
professional. Unable to continue
his professional career due to the
financial strain, he turned his
attention to coaching. During his
lone season as an assistant coach at
Georgia State, he helped the Pan-
thers to a seventh-place finish at
the CAA Championships.
Though he enjoyed his time at
Georgia State, accepting the posi-
tion as a Wolverine was a no-brain-
er.

Pumford was not only excited
for the opportunity to return to
Michigan and work with the Wol-@
verines as an assistant coach, buthe
is also thrilled to have the opportu-
nity to do it next to Whitten, a man
who helped him greatly and whose
coaching he deeply respects.
"He was definitely influential on
me and on the whole team," Pum-
ford said. "You could really see the
shift of the whole mentality of the
program when Chris came in to be
the assistant coach. My first year,
when I was a freshman, we were
ranked 110th in the country and
then in my senior year we finished
third in the NCAA - you could def-
initely see the improvement.
"I was really happy for him
when he got the job because I knew
he was going to do a great job, and
for him to give me a phone call anc
to tell me he wants me as his assis-
tant, it really is a dream come true."
He recognizesthat his presence
on the staff will be an advantage
"(Whitten)
was definitely
influential on ...
the whole team."
when recruits come to visit. He'll
be able to show them the campus
and the golf program with amore
personal perspective and hopes
that entices golfers to play at Mich-
igan.
Pumford will also be helped by
his familiarity with his surround-
ings and his players. Already with
an understanding of what the gol*
program is all about and a certain
comfort level with some of the
players who knew him before he
got the position, he hopes that the
environment will bring a relaxed,
but competitive relationship
between him and his players.
"They know I'm a competitive
person," Pumford said. "I have
high expectations and I want
to win and hopefully they can
feed off of that and continue to
improve."
