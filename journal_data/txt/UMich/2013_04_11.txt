On Wednesday, campus lead-
ers had a Hollywood night as
they were recognized in an
award-show-style celebration of
student achievement.

Now in its 34th year, the
Michigan Difference Student
Leadership Awards honor stu-
dent leaders from across the
University. Individuals and
groups are recognized based
on their work promoting the
University and servingthe com-
munity through philanthropy,
social work, school spirit or
notable accomplishments.
The event, which was held
in the Union's Rogel Ballroom,
drew about300 students, faculty

and community members. The
Central Student Government
also presented several awards
as part of the UM-Heroes initia-
tive launched this year.
CSG president Manish
Parikh said the awards recog-
nized individuals who might
not receive consistent recogni-
tion for their positive impact on
campus. .
"I think we really saw the
leaders of the campus commu-
nity," Parikh said. "Most of the

people here today don't seek the
spotlight. This is a quiet moment
of recognition. These awards
serve as a powerful source of
inspiration and motivation for
future Wolverines."

Department of
Education to receive
4.5-percent increase
in funding
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editor
The Obama administration
released its, recommendations
for the 2014 fiscal budget on
Wednesday, proposing a number
of investments aimed to improve
education on all levels - from
K-12 to higher education.
The administration's includes
budget plans to invest $71 billion
in discretionary funding for the
U.S. Department of Education -
an increase of 4.5 percent over
the 2013 pre-sequester invest-
ment - according to a release.
"(President Obama) funda-
mentally knows thatthe best way
to build and support a thriving

middle class is through world-
class education," Arne Duncan,
U.S. Secretary of Education, said
in a conference call.
Duncan said the focus of the
president's budget is on provid-
ing investments toward early
education for four-year-olds
from low and moderate-income
families. Obama's Preschool for
All initiative pians to strengthen
the education process "from cra-
dle to career."
"President Obama also under-
stands that there is an opportu-
nity gap separating far too many
of American children and limits
their life chances often to kids
before they even enter school,
and that's why the core part of
our budget is to restore $75 bil-
lion in investments to fully offset
mandatory funds over to expand
learning opportunities for all 4
year olds of all income families,"
Duncan added.

STRIKE A POSE ADMINISTRATION

Driskell introduces
gender equality
legislation
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Women in the state of Mich-
igan earn 74 percent as much
as their male counterparts,
according to a study by the
American Association of Uni-
versity Women. A legislative
package recently introduced
in the Michigan House of Rep-
resentatives looks to improve
that statistic.
Introduced in a press con-
ference Tuesday, the bills -
H.B. 4516 through 4519 - will
require employers to disclose
their wages and prevent pay
discrimination for equal work.
Attendees who came to cel-
ebrate the bill received wel-
come letter from Republican
Governor Rick Snyder.
"If we are to achieve true
equality, equal pay for women
is a must," Snyder wrote.
According to U.S. Census
Bureau's 2011 American Com-
munity Survey, the median
salary for women in Michigan

was $36,931, while men earned
$50,053.
State Rep. Gretchen Driskell
(D-Saline) said the bill will
allow women to better nego-
tiate their wages. She pointed
out that Michigan women
encounter one of the largest
pay gaps in the nation.
"It's a problem that isn't
being resolved without legisla-
tion," Driskell said.
The state of Michigan's
wage disparity between men
and women is the seventh larg-
est in the nation, according to
the AAUW.
A similar bill was intro-
duced to the state government
in 2008. The House passed
the legislation, but it failed to
make it through the Senate.
She said representatives felt it
was important to reintroduce
the bill.
The Paycheck Fairness
Act, which also aims to rem-
edy gender discrimination by
amending the Fair Labor Stan-
dards Act of 1938, was intro-
duced to federal Congress
Jan. 23. The bill has since been
referred to a congressional
committee.
Driskell said her bill would

Gunman killed after holding four
firefighters hostage in Ga. home

Senate plans to strengthen border
security with stricter surveillance

Demanded his
cable, power be
turned back on
SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) - A
gunman who was having finan-
cial problems held four fire-
fighters for hours in a suburban
Atlanta home, demanding his
cable and power be turned back

on, before being shot dead when
SWAT members stormed the
house, authorities said Wednes-
day. The hostages had cuts and
bruises from explosions officers
set off to distract the gunman
before moving in, but they will
be fine, a fire official said.
Minutes before the police
announcement on the resolu-
tion, a huge blast could be heard
a quarter-mile away from the

home, shuddering through the
Suwanee neighborhood, setting
off car alarms.
Earlier Wednesday, five fire-
fighters responded to what
seemed like a routine medical
call and were eventually taken
hostage by an unidentified sus-
pect inside the house, police
said. The gunman released one
of the firefighters to move a fire
truck but held the other four.

New electronic
verification of legal
status to be in put
in place
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Bipartisan immigration legisla-
tion being written in the Senate
would require surveillance of
100 percent of the U.S. border
with Mexico and apprehension*
of 90 percent of people trying
to cross the border. in certain
high-risk areas, a person famil-
iar with the proposals said
Wednesday.
People living here illegally
could begin to get green cards
in 10 years, but only if a new
southern border security plan
is in place, employers have
adopted mandatory electronic
verification of their workers'
legal status and a new elec-
tronic exit system is operating
at airports and seaports.
The person provided the-
information on condition of
anonymity because the delib-
erations were private.
The contours of the tough
new border security plans
emerged as senators moved
closer to unveiling sweeping
legislation within days that
would put some 11 million
immigrants living here ille-
gally on a path to citizenship
and allow tens of thousands of
high- and low-skilled workers
into the country on new visa
programs, in addition to secur-
ing the border.
Lawmakers and aides said
all the major elements were
complete, or close to. A final
deal was near on a new visa
for agriculture workers. There
were small details to be dealt
with on visas for high-tech
workers, but Sen. Dick Durbin,
D-Ill., said it wasn't enough to
hold up the bill.
"We are closer now than
we have been in 25 years for
serious immigration reform,"
Durbin told reporters Wednes-
day after he and other Demo-

crats in the Senate negotiating
group briefed members of the
Congressional Hispanic Cau-
cus. "This president is behind
it, and there is a strong, grow-
ing bipartisan effort in the Sen-
ate to support it. We hope that
the House will do the same."
Meanwhile tens of thou-
sands of pro-immigration
activists massed outside the
Capitol and in cities around
the country to push Congress
to act. They waved American
flags and carried signs read-
ing, "Reform immigration for
America now!"
The border security piece
of the legislation is critical to
getting support from Republi-
cans, but some Democrats have
opposed making a path to citi-
zenship contingent on border
security. Sen. Chuck Schum-
er, D-N.Y., said that the new
requirements wouldn't impede
citizenship.
"A lot of people here would
not want to put dollars into the
border, but as a price to get citi-
zenship, as long as it's not an
impediment to citizenship but
rather works alongside citizen-
ship, it's something we can all
live with," Schumer said, after
talking to the Hispanic House
members. "What we've said
all along is triggers have to be
objective and attainable in a
way it doesn't interfere or delay
with people becoming citizens,
and that's in the bill."
According to the person
familiar with the proposals, the
new border security require-
ments call for 100 percent
surveillance and a 90 percent
apprehension rate of border
crossers or would-be crossers
in sectors where the majority
of unauthorized entries take
place.
The goals would be achieved
by giving the Department of
Homeland Security six months
from the bill's enactment to
create the new border security
plan deploying the personnel,
infrastructure and technology
needed to achieve the 90 per-

cent effectiveness rate. Also
within six months, the depart-
ment would have to create a
plan to identify where new
fencing is needed on the bor-
der. Once those plans are certi-
fied, people living here illegally
could begin to apply for a pro-
visional status allowing them
to work here legally.
If the 90 percent rate of
apprehensions isn't achieved in
high-risk border sectors within
five years, a commission made
of border state officials would
make recommendations on
how to achieve it.
After 10 years, people granted
"registered provisional immi-
grant status" could apply for
green cards granting them per-
manentresidency - and the abil-
ity to seek citizenship - if the
new security and fencing plans
have been completed, the man-
datory employment verification
system is in place and used by
all employers, and the new elec-
tronic exit system is operating at
airports and seaports, collecting
machine-readable visa or pass-
port information from airplanes
and ships.
The electronic exit system
is meant to keep better track
of people in the country on
temporary visas. Some 40 per-
cent of people in the country
illegally arrived with visas but
stayed after they expired. The
employment verification piece
would be an expansion of an
existing system called E-Verify
that's currently voluntary for
most employers, though it's
mandatory in some states.
The bill would allocate $5.5
billion for the various propos-
als, including $1.5 billion for
fencing, $2 billion for other
border measures and $2 billion
to help the commission of bor-
der state officials do its work,
should that become necessary,
the person said, stressing more
or less money could be allocat-
ed if needed.
The border security details
were first reported Wednesday
by the Wall Street Journal.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., left, meets in his office with families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School
shooting in Newtown, Conn., on the day he announced that he reached a bipartisan deal on expanding background
checks to more gun buyers, on Capitol Hill in Washington Wednesday.
Senators com-promnise for
background check increase

Gun laws still to
be put through
Congress
WASHINGTON (AP)
Conservative senators from
both parties announced their
support for expanding back-
ground checks for gun buy-
ers Wednesday, giving a burst
of momentum to advocates of
stronger restrictions. But big
questions remain about wheth-
er President Barack Obama can
push significant gun controls
through Congress.
The compromise between
Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.,
and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa.,
boosted the chances that the
Senate will agree to broaden
required background checks, a
step gun control groups laud as
an effective way to keep weap-
ons from criminals and the
mentally ill. The senators are
among the most conservative
members of their parties, both
have received "A" ratings from
the National Rifle Association,
and their endorsements could
make it easier for hesitant col-
leagues to back the effort.
Gun control advocates still
face opposition from many
Republican senators and resis-
tance from moderate Demo-
crats, including several facing
re-election next year in GOP-
leaning states. In the Repub-
lican-run House, leaders have
shown little enthusiasm for
Obama's ideas, making that

chamber an even higher hur-
dle.
Under the agreement the
two senators announced at the
Capitol, background checks
would be expanded to all for-

office, telling them that "this
will not be in vain." He became
choked up when a reporter
asked about the impact of the
family members' visit, saying,

sales at gun shows and online,
with records kept by licensed
gun-dealers who would han-
dle the paperwork. Exempt-
ed would be noncommercial
transactions such as between
relatives. Currently, the sys-
tem applies only to sales by
the country's 55,000 federally
licensed firearms dealers.
The agreement also con-
tains provisions expanding
firearms rights, and that con-
cerns gun control supporters.
Some restrictions on trans-
porting guns across state lines
would be eased, sellers would
be shielded from lawsuits if
the buyer passed a check but
later used a firearm in a crime
and gun dealers could conduct
business in states where they
don't live.
"Truly the events at New-
town changed us all," said
Manchin, citing the Connecti-
cut town where December's
murders of 20 first-graders

that expanding the checks

Technology stocks reach record
high, double analysts' expectations

Stock market
reverses course,
rising three days
straight
NEW YORK (AP) - Tech-
nology stocks roared back
Wednesday, driving the Stan-
dard & Poor's 500 and Dow
Jones industrial average to
record highs.
The industry has lagged the
broader market this year, but
surged after network com-
munications company Adtran
reported earnings that were
double what Wall Street ana-
lysts expected. That boosted
optimism that businesses will
increase spending on technol-
ogy equipment.
Chipmakers Micron and
Intel jumped, as did other
network equipment makers
like Cisco and JDS Uniphase.
Stocks were also up on an opti-
mistic reading of the Federal
Reserve's latest minutes.
Technology stocks rose 1.8
percent, the most of the 10
industry groups in the S&P.
That's a big change from tech's
weak performance this year.
The group is up just 4.7 per-
cent, trailing the S&P's gain of
11.3 percent.
"Tech has performed so
poorly, it's oversold and war-
rants some interest here," said
Scott Wren, a senior equity
strategist at Wells Fargo Advi-
sors. "If the economy contin-
ues to improve there is going to

be some capital spending."
The stock market has
reversed course this week, ris-
ing three straight days. Last
week, investors' confidence
fell because of an unexpect-
edly poor report on the U.S. job
market and other signs that the
economy slowed in March.
The Dow Jones industrial
average jumped 128.78 points
Wednesday, or 0.9 percent, to
14,802.24. It was the biggest
one-day rise in a month. The
Dow is up 13 percent in 2013.
The Nasdaq composite,
which is heavily weighted with
technology stocks, had the
biggest percentage gainof the
three main indexes Wednes-
day, rising 59.39 points, or 1.8
percent, to 3,297.25. The S&P
rose 19.12 points, or 1.2 per-
cent, to 1,587.73.
Investors viewed positively
the minutes from the Fed-
eral Reserve's latest meeting,
which were released before the
market opened. The minutes
revealed that policy makers
are becoming more confident
that the U.S. economy can
grow without stimulus from
the Fed, said Brian Gendreau,
a market strategist at Cetera
Financial Group.
The Fed released the min-
utes at 9 a.m. Eastern, five
hours ahead of schedule, after
the document was inadvertent-
ly distributed to congressional
staff and trade group officials.
The market rose steadily in
the morning and stayed high
through the afternoon.
A majority of the Fed's 12

policymakers want to con-
tinue the stimulus. Still, many
members indicated they want
to slow and eventually end the
program before the end of the
year, as long as the job market
and economy show sustained,
improvement. The Fed didn't
disclose how many of its poli-
cymakers held those views.
That suggests that a num-
ber of Fed officials think the
economy may be doing well
enough to stand on its own.
The Fed has been buying $85
billion worth of bonds each
month to keep interest rates
extremely low, encourage
borrowing and spending and
drive money into riskier assets
like stocks.
"The idea that the Fed
thinks that we are closer to the
restoration of normality might
be positive for the market,"
said Gendreau.
While the Dow and S&P
have been setting record
highs frequently over the past
month, the Nasdaq remains
35 percent below its record
of 5,048 set March 10, 2000.
The index surged the during
the technology bubble of the
late 1990s. The Nasdaq is at its
highest level in more than 12
years.
Among stocks making big
moves, Facebook rose 98 cents,
or 3.7 percent, to $27.57 after
General Motors said it would
start running ads on the social
network site. Adtran rose
$2.75, or 14 percent, to $22.46,
and JDS Uniphase rose 64
cents, or 4.8 percent, to $13.98.

Don't block the vote
Legislation limiting the college vote is misguided
This week, Republican lawmakers from North Carolina
threatened college students' right to vote with the intro-
duction of Senate Bill 667. The bill, which was introduced
by State Rep. Bill Cook, targets the parents of college students by
imposing a tax increase on the families of students who choose to
register to vote in the state where they attend school. If the bill pass-
es, college students who register in a district other than that of their
parents can't be claimed as dependent for state income tax purpos-
es. While state income-tax fraud may need an overhaul, restricting
college students' access to voting is the wrong route to take.

I've got to tell you, candidly, I don't
consider criminal background
checks gun control."
- Senator Patrick J. Toomey (R-Penn.) said in response to the Senate's passage of
a bill that expands background checks on gun buyers on Wednesday.
Treatyourself

Also known as "Equalize voter Rights," this
bill attempts to bypass Symm v. United States,
the Supreme court decision that ruled states
cannot place unique burdens on college stu-
dents' access to the polls. In addition to requir-
ing that students register under their parents
address, the bill would also require they have
their vehicles registered at the same address
as their voter registration. Along with parents
takinga financial hit, perhaps more important-
ly, students' political efficacy would be dimin-
ished. Though tax fraud and evasion are serious
issues, restricting voting rights is neither ethi-
cal nor practical. As seen in the last decade of
elections, the voting system is already flawed.
Forcing students to send an absentee ballot or
returnto their parent's hometown further com-
plicates the process.
The bill defines a college student who reg-
isters at a separate address -who may still be
financially dependent on their parents - as
an independent. While not explicitly stated,
this would be an attempt to ensure that non-
permanent residents cannot unfairly influ-
ence the lawmaking in cities other than their
hometown. But with many students living on
campus for four or more years, it's clear that
students do have a stake in their college com-

munity. Even if college students are finan-
cially dependent, they still contribute to the
city where they attend school, and shouldn't
be denied influence in their current home.
For instance, students at the University could
be impacted by the proposed expansion of the
Ann Arbor Public Library - a ballot proposal
rejected in November's election.
This attempt of Republican lawmakers to
rectify fraudulent tax exemptions reflects a
larger trend of stifling certain group's voting
abilities to advance their own political agen-
da. Accordingto Think Progress, Indiana Rep.
Peggy Mayfield filed a bill that would prohibit
college students who pay out-of-state tuition
from voting in the state at all. This attack on
access to the ballot box is unfortunately more
than an isolated incident: according to Pro-
Publica, in 2012, more than 30 states enacted
voter ID laws that have disproportionately
impacted young minority voters.
The unconstitutional lengths to depress
the college vote are flawed, to say the least.
Fixing tax fraud issues can be done without
disenfranchising college voters, and taking
this path suggests legislators were motivated
by political gains, not a true desire for over-
hauling the system.

So, here it is - the almost
obligatory end of the semes-
ter, keep-your-chin-up
public service
announcement.
At this point,
we college stu-
dents are liv-
ing through an
archetypal story.
We're cranking
out papers on EMILY
Foucault and PITTINOS
geothermal heat-
ing systems like
those factory machines that can spit
out a thousand naked Twix bars in a
minute. Possible exam questions are
nagging us like clots of mosquitoes
buzzing just out ofswatting range.
Semester-long projects we've so far
only half-assed have animorphed
into pet chimpanzees turned feral
from neglect, and they're coming in
fast to maul our faces.
Meanwhile, the championship
has gone up in smoke with a pile
of extinguished couches, and cold
fronts of exam stress are meeting
warm fronts of imminent summer
departure to induce deluges of
romantic drama.
Basically, we feel screwed like ...
well ... a screw. But, enough simi-
les and metaphors; let's get to the
hearty dark meat of this message.
I find that in overwhelming times
like these, when responsibility
pressures me to make drastic and
uncharacteristic decisions - like
putting off the season premiere of
Mad Men in order to write a School
of Art & Design paper on how drop
spindles act as tools for meditation
and community building - I have to
do all Ican to remember myself.
In other words, it's actually easy
to cower in a sarcophagus of stress.
If I think, I'm powerless to the larger
forces of duty and expectation, then

spending my evenings in a rotation
between perusing Etsy shops, staring
at a blank Word document and pick-
ing at my cuticles becomes a pattern
that seems somehow necessary to
the process of polishing off winter
term. But in actuality I get nothing
done and end up feeling worse about
myself with each wasted hour.
My first mistake in this situation is
trading my binoculars in for a micro-
scope. I become so hyper-focused on
the immediate future and its associ-
ated stress that I paralyze my brain
and creative energies. I forget that
the tasks Ihave to complete are actu-
ally infinitesimallytiny steps toward
a greater and unknown future, and
it's not hard to lose sight of who Iam
outside of all this pressure.
Of course, I know that reducing
myself to a rubber-band ball of self-
doubt and aggravation isn't good
for anyone. It can make me lash out
at my housemates for little things,
like leaving bacon grease at the bot-
tom of our frying pan. It can keep
me from seeingthat my friends
are experiencing similar states of
mind and that my predicament is no
worse than theirs. Most of all, it's
unhealthy and unproductive. But
how do I shake the cycle?
Well, I've made a pact with myself
to screw the system and choose my
mental health above all else.
I know. It sounds too simple, yet
borders on blasphemous.
Let me explain.
By now, I've known myself for 20
years. I'm familiar with my limita-
tions. I know that when I get that
white-hot feeling of anxiety in my
chest or my lungs feel cramped
and airless after too much time in
the bowels of Hatcher Graduate
Library, it's time to back off. I've
learned that strategic procrastina-
tion can actually be an asset. Setting
aside a week's worth of evenings

to write a term paper can result in
heaps of wasted time that would've
been better spent blowing off steam
at the Blind Pig or going out for
Bibimbap with my friends.
It all comes down to trust. When I
look at my track record, I've rarely let
myself down. If there's an important
task to complete, I'll get it done, even
if that means concluding an essay
only minutes before class or stay-
ingup all night to sand a sculpture
for critique the next morning. And I
know Ican do this without sacrific-
ing the activities that keep me buoy-
ant, like napping, gossiping, giggling,
dancing, weaving, writing, whatever.
My biggest
mistake is trading
my binoculars for
a microscope.
Sure, this tactic may not be for
everyone. Maybe you're one of
those people who get a kick out
of squinting at organic chemistry
slides until your brain feels like
a bloated peanut. That's fine; you
do you.
But, if you're feeling like Sisy-
phus and are searching for relief, I
recommend taking a step back. Do a
naked lap around your house. Take
a make out break in the Stacks. Eat
an unholy amount of sushi. Treat
yourself. This is only a few weeks
in the scheme of your entire life,
and if happiness isn't making itself
readily available to you then you
have to create your own oasis.

JILL MAILING I
When privilege blinds us

Activate the qulet generation

Dear Suzy Lee Weiss,
When I initially read your op-ed in The
Wall Street Journal and watched your sub-
sequent appearance on the Today Show, I
was disgusted. Your sense of entitlement and
privilege was outrageous. However, it didn't
take long for me to realize that I couldn't hold
it against you. Four years ago, I was you.
You and 17-year-old me have a lot in com-
mon. We both come from white, upper-mid-
dle-class families. According to Wikipedia,
the racial demographics of our respective
high schools are quite similar. We're both
hard-working students, boasting high GPAs,
admirable test scores and a palatable smor-
gasbord of extracurricular activities. We're
both formidable writers. And we both poured
our hearts into our college applications.
We also both got rejected from name-
brand colleges. For you, it was Yale, Princ-
eton and University of Pennsylvania. For me,
it was Harvard and Cornell.
I remember feeling frustrated. I did every-
thing right. I worked tirelessly for perfect
grades, barely slept due to my packed sched-
ule of extracurricular activities and fulfilled
the appropriate amount of community ser-
vice and leadership opportunities to round
out my resume and essays. What more could
those schools possibly want?
Like you, I was riddled with unearned
privilege and completely unaware of it.
I was accepted to other schools that appealed
to me, including the University of Michigan.
After a few months of deliberation and a cam-
pus visit, I eventually decided to attend college
here. I have a million reasons to be thankful
for the fact that I chose the University; reading
your article gives me yet another.
I'm thankful that my University educa-
tion has made me aware. I now know how
my words and actions impact others beyond
the obvious; it made me aware of how aspects
of my identity beyond my control - my skin

color, my gender - are active forces in sys-
tems of power and oppression. It made me
aware of others' experiences, many of which
I couldn't previously even fathom. My Uni-
versity education made me smarter, more
articulate, more compassionate and more
understanding, but I'm most proud of the fact
it made me a better human being.
While I'd love to credit the University
as the only school capable of such a trans-
formation, it's likely not true. Not everyone
who graduates from here leaves with social
awareness, and plenty of other universities
(and experiences outside college) instill it as
well. Nonetheless, I'm grateful that I chose a
school that turned my world upside down in
the way I most needed it.
I hope you choose to attend the University,
and I hope it'll change you like it changed me.
I hope you participate in Intergroup Relations,
where you might get the chance to dialogue
with someone who's a lesbian, has two moms
or wears a hijab, and learn to respect that the
unique life challenges he or she experiences
are just that and didn't fodder for their college
application. I hope you take the community-
based classes I did, like the one where I taught
an inner-city seven-year-old to sound out the
word "the." She'll be fortunate if she graduates
high school, let alone gains acceptance to an Ivy
League school. I hope you'll read the research
I did about drug abuse and violence in low-
income communities, about unending racial
and cultural stereotyping, and most of all, about
the enormous chasm in bducational opportuni-
ties afforded to students from backgrounds like
you and me versus students living in poverty all
around our country and the world.
I hope that you'll feel as disheartened by
these realities as I did. Then, I hope you'll
feel as empowered to quit whining and do
something.
Jill Mailing is an University alum.

Ann Arbor is a city that's con-
sidered to be fairly activist-
oriented, yet at times the
lack of awareness
surprises me. It's
not thatwe don't
have causes we're
passionate about,
but the stress of
goingthrough
college, getting
into graduate HARSHA
school or finding NAHATA
a job makes it dif-
ficult to focus on
much else. We defer activism to the
social-justice organizations, or the
human-rights clubs or the Communi-
ty Action and Social Change minors.
We leave it up to those who are on
the career path of "activism."
In a 2007 New York Times col-
umn, Thomas Friedman coined us
Generation "Q" - Q for quiet. He
wrote, "I can report that the more
I am around this generation of col-
lege students, the more I am both
baffled and impressed ... I am baf-
fled because they are so much less
radical and politically engaged than
they need to be."
He's right. While it may be inevi-
table for us to be cautious, it's not
sustainable. Whether it's climate
change, the national debt or some-
thing as local as homelessness in Ann
Arbor, we're facing many serious
issues and apathy isn't an option.
This column has been a longtime
coming. I just needed the right cata-
lyst. That catalyst came April 6 at the
Midwest Asian American Student
Union conference.
StudioAPA founders Steve Nguyen
and Choz Belen put on a workshop
screeningtheir documentary, Hiba-
kusha - a film tellingthe story of
Kaz, one of the survivors of Hiro-
shima. That documentary has stuck
with me ever since.
Now in her 80s, Kaz was 18 years
old when the bombing took place.
Through the medium of animation,
we hear the story of her experience.

It's devastatingto see how one event
can destroy an entire city. The film's
closing was perhaps the most pow-
erful scene. Years after the attacks
on Hiroshima, Kaz is invited to be a
guest on Channel Four news. She's
on air alongside one of the pilots
that dropped a bomb - juxtaposing
two drastically opposite sides of this
debate. The pilot is asked if he would
go back and do anything differently.
The answer: No - militarily, this was
needed to end the war, and to "save
more lives in the long run."
In every issue, for every cause,
there's the politically strategic aspect
and the human aspect. When politi-
cians, the media or pundits discuss
an issue, most often the latter is the
least of their priorities. In all the
rhetoric, it's the voices of the weak
and disempowered that get lost first.
It's a luxury for us tobe removed
enough from a situation to debate the
pros and cons of dropping an atomic
bomb. Ask someone who lived it,
whose life was forever transformed.
And yet, they're the ones we've rarely
heard from. Activism is a way to give
these voices a platform to spread
awareness about the angles of a
debate that aren't heard.
Activism is misunderstood as
just for those directly affected by
an issue. Policy caters to public
opinion. It's not enough for one
person to raise their voice - we all
need to. A quote from Elie Wiesel
comes to mind: "Neutrality helps the
oppressor, never the victim. Silence
encourages the tormentor, never the
tormented."
Standing by and letting injustices
occur is as bad as committing injus-
tice yourself. Whether it's as big
as overseas attacks or as small as a
discriminatory comment, there's no
such thing as an innocent bystander.
I was able to sit down and talk
with Nguyen. His hope was for
people to learn from Kaz's story.
He said, "If there's anything I've
learned through this production,
it's that history generally tends

to repeat itself. If we can take
something from the lessons from
the past, we should utilize what
we've learned in a positive way and
continue to spread the awareness
to others that aren't familiar with
what's going on."
It's common to hear the term
social justice and get intimidated.
But social justice is just another way
of saying you care about something
bigger than yourself. It's a way of
making an impact in your commu-
nity and doing more than just what's
expected. Becoming aware doesn't
mean having to change the whole
world. It's as simple as takingsmall
steps to change your world - raising
awareness among your friends, orga-
nizations and community. It' even
just reading the news.
We leave change I
up to those on
the activism
career path.

I'll close with a quote by Dante
Alighieri: "The hottestplaces in hell
are reserved for those who, intimes
of great moral crisis, maintain their
neutrality."
We're living in a time of not one,
but many, great moral crises. From
drone strikes overseas to economic
inequality at home, there are count-
less injustices demanding our atten-
tion. Neutrality is the safe option,
but keeping quiet doesn't bring about
change. So step out of your comfort
zone and find that cause that makes
your blood boil. Think about what
you want your community to look
like and embodythat change.

A lifelong dedication to Michigan

ByALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Writer
Why Michigan?
How does a softball program
like Michigan's win five consecu-
tive Big Ten titles? How does
it become the first school east
of the Mississippi River to win
a national championship? And
what draws top recruits to Ann
Arbor?
It all starts with the coaching.
The crowd was sparse on
Tuesday afternoon with a chill in
the air, when the Wolverines wel-
comed intrastate rival Western
Michigan. The Wolverines were
halfway through their season,
but it was only their eighth home
game. The winter temperatures
force the program to schedule
almost all of its non-conference
games thousands of miles south,
and even still, weather post-
poned a pair of contests. A light
drizzle rained down on freshman
left fielder Sierra Lawrence when
she stepped to the plate and lifted
a sacrifice fly out to deep center,
and as the Georgia native trotted
back to the dugout, she looked up
at the gloomy sky.
So why Michigan?
"The coaches were just amaz-
ing, and I wanted to play for
them and allow them to make me
a better player," Lawrence said.
"The environment here was just
great."
Before the game, Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins stepped
into the team huddle and deliv-
ered a simple message: Play hard.
And they did. They played hard
for themselves, for the name on
the front of their jersey and for
the coaching staff that gave them
the opportunity to compete at
the collegiate level. Hutchins
doesn't like to talk about it, but
the 29-year veteran recently
became just the third colle-
giate softball coach to win 1,300
games. Maybe that's why Law-

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins recently won her 1,300th career game, and four of her former players are now coaching in the Big Ten.

rence chose Michigan.
"You don't want to go some-
where and trust the coaching
staff and then they leave," Law-
rence said. "Hutch and the rest of
the coaching staff have been here
for awhile."
The coach fondly known as
"Hutch" has led the softball pro-
gram for longer than any of her
current players have been alive.
She's humble, passionate and,
despite graduating from Michi-
gan State, devoted to the Wolver-
ines. She's had the opportunity
to represent the United States,
coaching the U.S. National and
Elite teams, but Hutchins still
prefers donning the maize and
blue.
"There's nothing like Michi-
gan," she said. "I gotta tell ya,
there's nothing like Michigan.
This place really gets in your
heart."
Hutchins' love for the Univer-
sity and her players transcends
the normal confines of a relation-
ship. Hunched over and glar-
ing into the batter's box in the
third-base coach's area during a

recent series against Ohio State,
Hutchins occasionally glanced
over into the visiting team's dug-
out. There, she saw a familiar
face, heard a familiar voice. It
was Kelly Kovach Schoenly, her
former All-American pitcher and
a former colleague who was now
coaching the Buckeyes.
To Hutchins, every Michigan
player who walks through the
glass door into the Donald R.
Shepherd Softball Building is a
member of her family. And it's not
a relationship she takes lightly.
Yes, Schoenly's picture hangs on
the wall, one of dozens oftributes
to former All Americans. But her
number - and almost everyone
else's - is stored in Hutchins's
phone, and the two communicate
regularly.
"They're all my kids. They're
my family," Hutchins said. "I'm
like a proud mother."
Despite wearing scarlet and
gray, Schoenly has plenty of rea-
sons to feel welcomed back to
Ann Arbor. As a Wolverine in the
1990s, she earned All-American
honors, was twice named Big

Ten Pitcher of the Year and was a
three-time all-conference selec-
tion. After she graduated, she
planned on becoming a teacher,
but Hutchins gave her a spot
on the coaching staff and later
helped her earn jobs at Miami
(Ohio) and Ohio State. Schoenly
hasn't looked back.
"Hutch had such an impact on
me, if I even have half that impact
on the girls that I'm coaching,
I'll feel like I did a great job,"
Schoenly said. "I'm thankful that
my life took me through Michi-
gan and through Hutch. She gave
me that push and that opportu-
nity you don't always get when
you're 22 years old. I look to her
as a mentor."
The Wolverines swept the
three-game series against Ohio
State due in part to junior right
fielder Nicole Sappingfield. In
high school, the California native
wasn't even considering play-
ing college softball because she
didn't know much about it. Then,
she was discouraged by stories
of Michigan's dismal winter
weather. Sappingfield committed

anyway after speaking with the
coaching staff.
"The coaches had a lot to do
with it," Sappinfield said of her
decision to come to Ann Arbor.
"To me, they're the best coaching
staff in the country."
Hutchins is known for the
stern personality that she hides
behind steely blue eyes, but that
fire seems to inspire her teams
to perform better. Training tire-
less hours at the Oosterbaan
Fieldhouse during the colder
months and traveling thousands
of miles each weekend to warmer
states for non-conference series,
Hutchins puts pressure on her
players to perform and rarely
breaks her icy glare. But her rela-
tionship with her teams is one of
hard-earned respect and com-
mitment to the sport, one that
often lasts beyond the college
years.
Schoenly is one of four for-
mer Wolverines coaching in
the 12-team Big Ten (two head
coaches and two assistants),
and Hutchins hopes more come
from her current roster. Halfway

through the season, her team has
jelled, winning 13 consecutive
games and holding sole posses-
sion of first place in the Big Ten.
They have grown close over their
shared love for softball, and that
gives Hutchins a reason to smile.
During their game against
the Broncos, junior first base-
man Caitlin Blanchard smacked
a line drive that whistled straight
towards Hutchins near the
third-base bag. Backpedaling
deftly, the coach barely stepped
out of the way in time, and both
Blanchard and Hutchins burst
out laughing.
"We're a really close-knit
group," Hutchins said. "You go
through the war every year with
these kids."
Hutchins relies on traditions
to make it through that war alive.
Before games, as the opponent is
introduced by the public-address
announcer, each player leans
over near the dugout and etches
a picture into the ground. Some
draw numbers; others, shapes.
Hutchins rewards a Michigan
batter who hits a home run by
tossing her a peanut M&M as she
rounds third base. These are cus-
toms that span back as far as the
players can remember, traditions
that Hutchins says help loosen
the players during tense situa-
tions.
This is the softball program
that Hutchins has created. A
head coach for 29 seasons and
an assistant for two more, Carol
Hutchins is Michigan softball.
"This has been my life, and it's
made me so happy," she said.
She starred at Michigan State,
so her picture will never be onthe
All-American wall of the Donald
R. Shepherd Softball Building.
But most of those faces came to
Michigan because of Hutchins,
and every single one of them is a
member of the Michigan softball
family- even though some ended
up at rival schools.

Only rain can stop 'M'

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
With the Michigan softball
team up 8-0 heading into the bot-
tom of the fourth inning Tuesday
against Western Michigan, Ali-
cia Keys's "Girl on Fire" played
over the speakers at Alumni
Field.
"This girl is on fire."
For the Wolverines as of late,
though, the tune has sounded
more like "These girls are on
fire."
Because these girls and this
team are rolling right now.
No. 12 Michigan is riding a
14-game winning streak that
started in mid-March. It was
hoping to extend it Wednesday
against Eastern Michigan, but
the game was cancelled due to
weather. Big offense and strong
pitching has provided the frame-
work for a team that has forgot-
ten what it's like to lose.
"You want to get in a groove
each season," said Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins. "And
we're starting to get into that
groove."
Highlights from the streak
include wins over No. 2 Ari-
zona State, then-No. 14 Arizona
and sweeps of Big Ten foes Pur-
due, Penn State and Ohio State.
Along the way, Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins also picked up
her 1,300th win - becoming the
third NCAA softball coach in his-
tory to reach that mark.
For the Wolverines (9-0 Big
Ten, 32-7 overall), strong pitch-
ing has been the key to winning.
During the streak, Michigan
pitchers have given up 38 runs
- less than three per outing. In
comparison, in the Wolverines'
last fourlosses, opponents scored
an average of8.5 runs against the
team.
In the circle, sophomore
left-hander Haylie Wagner has
relieved fellow sophomore right-
hander pitcher Sara Driesenga
of having to pitch every inning.
With Wagner injured at the
beginning ofthe season, the team
depended on Driesenga. Now
with the duo splitting duties on
the mound, Driesenga is able to

get more rest.
"Having two pitchers, we can
always rely on each other," Wag-
ner said. "It takes a lot of pressure
off of Sara or vice versa, which
takes alot of pressure off of me."
Since Michigan's home open-
er - two wins into the streak
- Wagner and Driesenga have
a combined 56 strikeouts in 62
innings. Opponents are hitting
just .206 and .223, respectively,
against them.
Offensively, the Wolverines
have averaged more than nine
runs a game during the streak.
Junior centerfielder Lyndsay
Doyle and junior right fielder
Nicole Sappingfield have done
their job of setting the table. The
top two hitters in the lineup,
respectively, have combined for
27 hits and just as many runs in
the last 14 games.
With Doyle and Sappingfield
reaching base consistently, it has
given freshman shortstop Sierra
Romero - who has been consis-
tently hitting the cover off of the
ball all year - opportunities to
add to her impressive stat line.

During the streak, Romero has
racked up 23 RBI and increased
her batting average 50 points
from.361 to .411.
Most vital to Michigan's suc-
cess is its depth. During the
streak, senior second baseman
Ashley Lane and senior third
baseman Amy Knapp have pro-
vided an offensive boost and
have been strong in the field.
Lane owns 13 RBI and three
home runs during the consecu-
tive 14 wins, and Knapp has col-
lected 10 runs and collected 12
hits during the span.
Despite the streak, the Wol-
verines have been conditioned
by Hutchins to take it one day at
a time.
"We don't really think about
the streak," Wagner said. "We
just play it one game at time,
and (play) one-pitch softball. Of
course it's great to have a win-
ning streak, but we're just going
to keep playing Michigan soft-
ball."

"I think that did wonders for

While Casanova has competed

in the next season. After all, she's
only been in Ann Arbor for four
months.
"I definitely look for her to

Two years after quake,
nuke plant still crippled

Fukushima slow to
recover following
2011 meltdown
TOKYO (AP) - A rat causing a
power outage by short-circuiting
a temporary switchboard. Anoth-
er blackout occurring as work-
ers install anti-rat nets. Holes in
the linings of huge underground
tanks leakingradioactive water.
Japan's crippled Fukushima
Dai-ichi nuclear power plant
has run into multiple problems
recently that highlightits precar-
ious state more than two years
after its reactors melted down in
the wake of a devastating earth-
quake and tsunami.
A makeshift system of pipes,
tanks and power cables meant
to carry cooling water into the
melted reactors and spent fuel
pools inside shattered buildings
remains highly vulnerable, Nucle-
ar RegulationAuthority chairman
Shunichi Tanaka acknowledged
Wednesday.
"Fukushima Dai-ichi is still in
an extremely unstable condition,
there is no mistake about that,"

Tanaka said at a weekly meeting
of the regulatory body's leaders.
"We cannot rule out the possibil-
ity that similar problems might
occur again. Whenever aproblem
occurs, it halts the plant's opera-
tions and delays the primary goal
of decommissioningthe plant."
The problems have raised
doubts about whether the plant
can stay intact through a decom-
missioning process that could
take 40 years, prompting offi-
cials to compile risk-reduction
measures and revise decommis-
sioning plans. The regulatory
watchdog said Wednesday that
it was increasing the number of
inspectors from eight to nine to
better oversee the plant.
Just over the past three weeks,
there have been at least eight
accidents or problems at the
plant, the nuclear watchdog said.
The first was March 18, when
a rat sneaked into an outdoor
switchboard - which was sitting
on a pickup truck - powering
the jury-rigged cooling system
and several other key parts of
the plant, causing a short-circuit
and blackout that lasted 30 hours
in some areas of the plant. Four

Fox reporter Jana Winter, right, at a hearing for Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes in Centennial, Colo.,
Wednesday. A judge will decide whether Winter must reveal an anonymous source she cited in an article about Holmes.
Cob, shooter hearing
delayed by reporter

Judge yet to decide
if journalist must
name source
CENTENNIAL, Colo. (AP) -
The judge in the Colorado theater
shootings refused again Wednes-
day to make a quick decision on
whether to order a Fox News
reporter to reveal her confiden-
tial sources for a story she wrote
last year.
In the article, New York-
based reporter Jana Winter
cited anonymous law-enforce-
ment sources who said shoot-
ing suspect James Holmes sent
a notebook containing violent
drawings to a University of Colo-
rado, Denver psychiatrist before
the attack.
Holmes, who had been a stu-
dent at the university, is charged
with fatally shooting 12 people
and injuring 70 at a movie theater
in the Denver suburb of Aurora
on July 20. A judge has entered
a not guilty plea on his behalf.
Prosecutors are seeking the
death penalty.
Holmes' lawyers want to

know the names of the officials
who spoke to Winter. They
argue the leak violated a gag
order and could weaken the
credibility of those officials if
they are called to testify in a
trial.
Defense attorney Rebecca
Higgs suggested Wednesday
that law-enforcement officers
may have lied under oath when
they denied speaking to Winter.
That was sufficient reason to
require Winter to testify, Higgs
said.
Pacing and gesturing, Higgs
argued the issue is whether a law
enforcement officer decided to
"flat-out lie."
Judge Carlos Samour Jr. said
he would not make a decision on
Winter's sources until he rules
on whether the notebook will be
admitted as evidence, reiterating
a written order he issued Mon-
day.
He told Winter she would have
to return for another hearing
Aug. 19.
Winter argues she should
not have to identify her sources
under Colorado and New York
shield laws that protect report-

ers' sources under some circum-
stances.
If the judge orders her to reveal
her sources and she refuses, she
could be jailed.
In December, 20 law-enforce-
ment officers testified or sub-
mitted affidavits saying they
did not speak to Winter. One of
them, Aurora police Detective
Alton Reed, took the stand again
Wednesday and said he spoke
only to an Aurora police sergeant
about what he saw in the note-
book. That sergeant already has
testified that he did not speak to
Winter.
The judge on Wednesday also
ordered both sides not to discuss
plea negotiations in future court
filings, saying that violated state
judicial rules.
Last month, defense lawyers
said in a court filingthat Holmes
had offered to plead guilty if
prosecutors would agree to a
life sentence. That prompted an
angry response from prosecu-
tors, who said in their own filing
thatthe offer wasn'tgenuine and
accused the defense of trying to
drum up public pressure for a
deal.

ing Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
plant's operator, to acknowledge
that it had added backup power
only to the reactors, despite
repeated concerns raised over a
pool meltdown.
The cause of the outage wasn't
clear at the time, but TEPCO later
released a photo of the electro-
cuted rat, which had fallen onthe
bottom of the switchboard out-
house. The most extensive out-
age since the crisis started after
the March 2011 disasters caused
some Fukushima residents to 4

Two weeks later, a new water
processing machine designed
to remove most radioactive ele-
ments temporarily stopped after
a worker pushed a wrong button.
The next day, one of the fuel stor-
age pools lost power again for
several hours when part of a wire
short-circuited a switchboard
while an operator installed anti-
rat nets. TEPCO reported three
other minor glitches on the same
day, including overheating of

SANAA, Yemen (AP) -
Yemen's president removed his
predecessor's son and nephews
from powerful security posts
on Wednesday in the most dra-
matic step yet in sidelining old
regime figures, according to the
nation's state-run media.
Former President Ali Abdul-

rule, placed relatives and loy-

EDUCATION
From Page 1A
on reforming the K-12 agenda by
investing in teachers and school
turnaround efforts, keeping
schools and communities safe
from gun violence, increasing
career readiness in high school
and improving affordability of
higher education.
Duncan said studies have
determined that students with
limited education before pre-
school are less prepared for suc-
cess, an education gap that could
hinder them for the rest of their
lives.
"Dramatically expanding
access to high-quality early edu-
cation will not only help to clog
(the achievement) gap by provid-
ing America's youngest learners
with a strong start, it will also
pay huge dividends down the
road in higher graduation rates,
increased employment, better
jobs at higher salaries, greater
cash revenue, and lower crime
and reliance on public assis-
tance," Duncan said.
The president plans to create
"ladders of opportunity" to the
middle class through the Promise
Neighborhoods program and to
invest in low-income communi-
ties.

Duncan said Obama's budget
shows that education is a "cross-
cutting" issue, as it's spread "all
the way through the adminis-
tration." Obama will be working
to reform Head Start, a national
program that promotes school
readiness by enhancingthe social
and cognitive development of
children.
The budget also plans to raise
all $74 million for preschool
reform by imposing a 94-cent tax
on tobacco, Duncan said.
"The projection is that 233,000
fewer youths will begin smoking
as a result of the tax," Duncan
said. "Obviously, this is a huge
reduction of health-care costs. It
has a benefit to health and benefit
educationally, and we think it's
the right thing to do."
Duncan said the main higher-
education priorities are to make
schools and communities safer
and make college more afford-
able for students and to improve
opportunities for students in dis-
advantaged communities.
"We're working to double
work-studies opportunities to
make college more affordable,"
Duncan said. "In addition, we
have a focus on increasing high-
school graduation rates by help-
ing kids take the next step going
into higher education. We want
to invest more in dual-enrollment

programs which is great not just
for high-achieving, but for at-
risk students who as juniors and
sophomores can start to take col-
lege classes and start to believe
that they can be a part of that
world."
The president plans to address
affordability by investing $1 bil-
lion in Race to the Top: College
Affordability and Completion,
creating change in each state's
higher-education practices. To
encourage students, $260 mil-
lion will be used for a First in the
World fund, which would create
competitive awards for innova-
tion in higher education.
The plan also includes expand-
ing and funding financial aid pro-
grams and the Pay As You Earn
repayment option - a program
that ensures loan payments for
students who don't exceed 10
percent of their discretionary
income.
"Today, millions of Americans
have a better chance of getting a
job, owning their own home and
supporting their family," Duncan
said. "We know we have a long
way to go, but if we want to con-
tinue to make progress we have to
drive and continue improvement
through k-12 reform and we must
invest in human capital, in our
great futures and leaders, which
we propose to do in this budget."

COALITION

the cause.
"She will really inspire stu-
dents and campus community
members to really respond
to this call to action that her
story shows," Mersol-Barg said.
"There's so much that we can do
when we work with others in the
community to address a wrong."
When Andiola's mother and
brother were deported from the
United States, she began her
fight for immigrants' rights by
connecting with a broader net-
work of activists. Her efforts
stopped the deportation of her
family as well as. other undocu-
mented immigrants.
Andiola's work focuses on law
enacted in 12 states - modeled

after the failed federal DREAM
Act - that allows public insti-
tutions to grant aid to undocu-
mented students. As the leader
of the Arizona DREAM Coali-
tion, Andiola has challenged
three senators and has lobbied
for immigration rights in Wash-
ington D.C.
Mersol-Barg said he hopes
Andiola's speech will inspire
students to work for immigra-
tion rights at the University
level. He added that the event
will serve as a precursor to the
CTE's planned protest at the
University's Board of Regents
meeting next Thursday, which
will be similar to its protest last
December.
"We will be demonstrating
our strong support for tuition
equality and for this commu-
nity for students who are being

really discriminated against for
the University's policies," Mer-
sol-Barg said. "We're going to
really hit home this idea that it's
unacceptable for the University
to stand idly by."
Upon receiving the report
produced by the organization,
the administrationcreatedatask
force to review it, which didn't
include members from the coali-
tion. Mersol-Barg said while the
University has been "relatively
mum" since the release of the
report, protesting at the regents
meeting has been the coalition's
most effective action.
"Although we are somewhat
disappointed that we will not
participate in the executive
community, we will not let that
stay between us and lobbying
the University to draft tuition
equality," Mersol-Barg said.

BLUE CARPET

Engineering graduate student
Nick Fredricks, the group's chief
engineer, said he didn't expect
either award.
Fredricks added that E-MAG-
INE hasn't been on campus for
very long but has already shown
its impact.
"It was amazing to win both of
these," Fredricks said. "It's just
a resemblance of how far we've
come. We've just made such an
impact on this college, and it's all
due to this amazing group, not
just one person's effort."
Malinda Matney, a senior
research associate in the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs, managed
the selection process for the 50
awards presented at this year's
ceremony. She said the organiza-
tions that received awards were
selected in a two-step process:
initial nomination and selection
by the committee.
This year, about 200 individu-
als and groups received nomi-
nations. After nominations are
received, Matney said the com-
mittee contacts the nominators
and nominees directly to get more
information and make their deci-

sion.
"We make step one very easy,"
Matney said. "We just want
to know who's out there. A lot
of what we'll be talking about
in granting the winners their
awards comes directly from that
second step of the process."
Kate Poisson, a student
involvement advisor at the Center
for Campus Involvement, said the
event draws its award winners
from across campus.
"There's a wide range of differ-
ent organizations and individuals
that are recognized. We tried to
hit all of those main groups that
we have on campus," Poisson said.
Poisson said the event offers
a unique look at what leaders on
campus were able to attain this
past year.
"What we're really trying to
do here is not just recognize the
student groups we have here on
campus, but celebrate them,"
Poisson said. "We don't always
get a chance to take a step back
and think, 'Wow, look at every-
thing we've accomplished in the
last year.'"
The ceremony underwent a
major transformation two years
ago to give it more flair. Matney
described it as "Emmys meets
MTV awards."

The eventborrowed manyofits
themes from Hollywood award
shows, including a ceremonial
blue carpet for students enter-
ing the ballroom and'a memorial
video segment for all the trends,
memes and fads that "died" in
the last year. There were also live
performances by Maize Mirchi, a
South Asian acappella group, and
the Michigan Pompon team.
Kinesiology senior Dustyn
Wright attended this year's event
to represent the University's
chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fra-
ternity, which won the Fraternity
or Sorority of the Year Award at
last year's ceremony. Wright said
his fraternity has dedicated itself
to promoting a "higher standard"
within the Greek life system after
the chapter was banned from the
University from 2007 to 2011 for
issues with alcohol..
This year's honor went to
Lambda Theta Alpha. Though his
fraternity didn't win the award
for a second year, Wright said
the ceremony has a very positive
impact on the Greek system.
"It allows the (community) to
celebrate their success alongside
other organizations' successes."

He said he believed "there

A spokesman for Netanyahu

"I want everyone to pray

awareness for the wage gap.
State Rep. Pat Somerville
(R-New Boston) said the bill's

language is vague and there's
no "apples-to-apples" consider-
ation of each sex's experience,
education and other variables
when delegating equal pay. For
instance, he said it would allow
women who take time off to
raise a family to receive the same
income as a man in the same job
with more experience.

Somerville added that sta-
tistics are being misconstrued
to show a pay gap exists where
there might not be one. He said
data might reflect that, when
work-related variables are kept
constant, women have an advan-
tage over men in equal pay.
"I believe the bill is searching
for a problem that doesn't exist."

New study helps doctors see
pain inthe brain, drug effects

New study exposes if
drugs relieving pain,
opens possibilities
In a provocative new study,
scientists reported Wednesday
that they were able to "see" pain
on brain scans and, for the first
time, measure its intensity and
tell whether a drug was relieving
it. Though the research is in its
early stages, it opens the door to
a host of possibilities.
Scans might be used some-
day to tell when pain is hurting
a baby, someone with dementia
or a paralyzed person unable to
talk. They might lead to new, less
addictive pain medicines. They
might even help verify claims for
disability.
"Many people suffer from
chronic pain and they're not
always believed. We see this as
a way to confirm or corroborate
pain if there is a doubt," said Tor
Wager, a neuroscientist at the
University of Colorado, Boulder.
He led the research, published
in the New England Journal of
Medicine: So far it is only on
pain felt through the skin - heat
applied to an arm. More study
needs to be done on more com-
mon kinds of pain, such as head-
aches, bad backs and pain from
disease.
Independent experts say the
research shows a way to mea-
sure objectively what is now one
of life's most subjective experi-
ences.
Pain is the top reason people
see a doctor, and there's no way
to quantify how bad it is other
than what they say. A big quest
in neuroscience is to find tests or
scans that can help diagnose ail-
ments with mental and physical
components such as pain, depres-
sion and PTSD, or post-traumatic
stress disorder.
Although many studies have
found brain areas that light up

when pain is present, the new
work is the first to develop a com-
bined signature from all these
signals that can be used to mea-
sure pain.
"This is very exciting work.
They made a huge breakthrough
in thinking about brain patterns,"
said Dr. David Shurtleff, acting
deputy director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, which
helped sponsor the research.
"We need a brain-based signa-
ture for pain. Self-report doesn't
cut it. It's not reliable, it's not
accurate."
The research involved four
experiments at ColumbiaUniver-
sity approved by a panel to ensure
no participants were harmed. In
all, 114 healthy volunteers were
paid $50to $200 tobe tested with
a heating element placed against
a forearm at various tempera-
tures, not severe enough to cause
burns or lasting damage. Some of
the experiments required them
to stand it for 10 to 20 seconds.
"It's like holding a hot cup of
coffee that you really want to put
down but can't quite yet," Wager
said.
Functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging, or fMRI scans,
which don't require radiation
as X-rays do, recorded changes
in brain activity as measured by
blood flow. Computers were used
to generate signatures or pat-
terns from these readings.
The first set of experiments on
20 people developed signatures
for pain versus the anticipation
of it or mild warmth on the arm.
The second experiment validat-
ed these signatures in 33 other
people and found they predicted
how much pain they said they
felt.
"It's really what seems to be a
true measure of the experience
that the patient's having," and
it gives a number to pain sever-
ity that can guide care, said one
expert with no role in the studies,
Dr. Costantino Iadecola, director

of the Brain and Mind Research
Institute at Weill Cornell Medi-
cal College.
Researchers took their work
a step further with the third
experiment, which involved
40 people who recently lost a
serious love relationship and
were feeling intensely rejected.
Besides the heat tests, they had
scans while being shown a pic-
ture of their former partners and
then a picture of a good friend.
Researchers found the brain sig-
natures for social or emotional
painwere different fromthe ones
for physical pain.
"That's very provocative," said
Dr. Allan Ropper, a neurologist
at Brigham and Women's and
Harvard University who wrote a
commentary in the journal. The
signatures seem highly accurate
and able to distinguish physical
pain from other kinds, he said.
In the fourth experiment,
researchers gave 21 participants
two infusions of a morphine-
like drug while they were being
scanned and having the heat
tests. The first time, they knew
they were getting the drug. The
second time they were told they
were getting dummy infusions
but in fact got the drug again.
Brain signatures showed their
pain was being relieved both
times in proportion to how much
drug was in their systems.
"This is beginning to open a
new wedge into brain science,"
Ropper said. "There may be com-
pletely novel ways of treating
pain by focusing on these areas of
the brain rather than on conven-
tional medications which block
pain impulses from getting into
the spinal cord and brain."
Shurtleff, of the federal drug
abuse agency, also said he hoped
the research would lead to newer
drugs.
"We want medications that
can reduce this signature and
don't show a signature for addic-
tion," he said.

Syrian rebels not
consulted before
Iraqi group merger
BEIRUT (AP) - Tensions
emerged Wednesday in a newly
announced alliance between
al-Qaida's franchise in Iraq and,
the most powerful Syrian rebel
faction, which said it was not
consulted before the Iraqi group
announced their merger and only
heard about it through the media.
Al-Qaida in Iraq said Tues-
day that it had joined forces with
Jabhat al-Nusra or the Nusra
Front - the most effective force
among the mosaic of rebel bri-
gades fightingto topple President
Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war.
It said they had formed a new
alliance called the Islamic State
in Iraq and the Levant.
The Syrian government seized
upon the purported merger to
back its assertion that it is not
facing a true popular movement

for change but rather a foreign-
backed terrorist plot. The state
news agency said Wednesday
that the union "proves that this
opposition was never anything
other than atool usedby the West
and by terrorists to destroy the
Syrian people."
Talk of an alliance between
Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaida
in Iraq has raised fears in Bagh-
dad, where intelligence officials
said increased cooperation was
already evident in a number of
deadly attacks.
And in Syria, a stronger Jab-
hat al-Nusra would only further
complicate the battlefield where
Western powers have been
covertly trying to funnel weap-
ons, training and aid toward
more secular rebel groups and
army defectors.
* Washington has designated
Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist orga-
nization over its links with al-
Qaida, and the Syrian group's
now public ties with the terrorist
network are unlikely to prompt a

shift in international support for
the broader Syrian opposition.
Earlier this year, the U.S.
announced a $60 million non-
lethal assistance package for
Syria that includes meals ad
medical supplies for the armed
opposition. It was greeted unen-
thusiastically by some rebel lead-
ers, who said it does far too little.
Washington's next step is
expected to be a broader pack-
age of non-lethal assistance,
expanding from food and medi-
cal supplies to body armor and
night-vision goggles. However,
President Barack Obama has not
given final approval on any new
package and an announcement is
not imminent, a senior adminis-
tration official said.
Secretary of State John Kerry,
who met with Syrian opposition
leaders in London on Wednesday,
hinted at the new non-lethal aid
package this week, saying the
administration had been hold-
ing intense talks on how to boost
assistance to the rebels.

BEHIND

SCREENS:

DESIGN AND ILLUSTRATION BY NICK CRUZ

Jt has been a long time coming. Arcade wizards
have been vying for world-record high scores since
arcade cabinets were introduced. In the 1990s and
early 2000s, Local Area Network-based events
gave the hardcore garners opportunities to com-
pete against one another. Today, innovations in technology
and a shift in culture provide individuals with a competi-
tive outlet in games like "StarCraft," "League of Legends"
and "Call of Duty," among many others, forming the profes-
sional leagues that fund and organize tournaments letting
gainers play videogames for up to seven-figure prize pools.
This culture h1as since been dubbed eSports, short for elec-
tronic sports.
A platform for watching games
At the head of eSports is Sean "Day[9]" Plott, CEO and
host at DAY[9]TV. His "Day[9] Daily" web series centers on
strategy in the competitive online video game "StarCraft
IL" He regularly acts as a commentator for professional
gaming tournaments worldwide.
"I get nervous when I'm on air," Plott joked.
Broadcasting since October 22, 2009, Plott's a veteran of
the "StarCraft" scene for over 12 years and is a former pro-
fessional gamer. But the 2000s were a rough time to be in
the business. The aesthetic gap between games first com-
ing out and the games being played competitively was large
enough to make potential tournament sponsors "leery of
involving themselves ... (asking) 'Why are we doing an old
game? Why aren't we doing a new game that looks beauti-
ful?' "Plott said.
The release of "StarCraft II" in 2010 marked the start of
eSports' popularity and prevalence in the gaming commu-
nity. The visual quality and high-speed action of the game
kept watchers enthralled. Best of all, a new way of reach-

ing viewers became available through online platforms like
Justin.tv, which hosted a lot of "StarCraft II" content imme-
diately after release. It also allowed individuals streaming
their gameplay to post ads on their channels during breaks
in action. Similarly, YouTube was, and still is, an enormous
platform for watchinggames, and its revenue-sharingprac-
tices made it an attractive option.
"Now, all of a sudden, not only is it free to stream, but you
can actually generate revenue streaming," Plott explained.
"You could, at any hour of the day, even if there was no tour-
nament, you could watch the best of the best... duking it out.
The spectator sport began to grow because streaming was
so huge."
"StarCraft II" is now available to watch on gameplay-
streaming sites like Twitch.tv (formerly part of Justin.tv),
where hundreds of thousands of spectators tune in every
day to watch players practice and compete. Many tune in
to watch "League of Legends," "Call of Duty," "Dota 2" and
other games whose exciting nature and demand for exten-
sive practice have earned them massive viewerships and
the title of eSports.
The second trend Plott pointed to is a shift in eSports
from smaller communities outward as the movement
gained legitimacy.
"It started off with the grassroots communities - the
streamers like djWHEAT, like JP, like me just making con-
tent that we thought was cool ... (and) the community on
Team Liquid and Reddit doing their best," he recalled.
"Then, we started to see the tournamentorganizers start
to step in and make huge moves ... it was the tournament
organizers doing the big, flashy involvement and being lead-
ers," Plott continued. "Now we're starting to see the pub-
lishersget involved. The publishers saying things like ... 'We
are going to run our own thing and because it's our game,
we can do all sorts of great integrations with that.'"

The standard for competition
In "StarCraft II," players compete online against one
another for placement within a given division of a given
league, which corresponds with their skill level. As play-
ers excel and are placed into gradually higher leagues, from
the humble Bronze, representing the bottom eight percent
of players, to the exalted Grandmaster league, which repre-
sents only the top-200 players in a given region.
"For a while, (going pro) was just playing on the ladder of
whatever game and then (hoping) that a tournament orga-
nizer or team would see you," Plott said. "Now, your perfor-
mance on the ladder can seed you into a tournament where
you could become a huge pro."
More and more, formerly under-the-radar players are
being brought to the main stage either by streaming their
own content or getting into tournaments that their play
helps them gain entry to, a model used by many other com-
petitive games.
Blizzard, one of the world's largest game development
companies, recently instated three World Championship
Series regions, split between South Korea, North America
and Europe. Each region will have qualifying rounds and
elimination rounds starting this month. The ultimate goal
is to crown a world champion at the end of each year in a
massive tournament broadcast live across the globe.
"I really likethe direction (Blizzard's) going in," said LSA
Freshman Adriel Leung. As an amateur "StarCraft II" play-
er himself, he is the current coordinator for the University's
Collegiate StarLeague team. For students, the CSL provides
a structured avenue to play competitively. Competing play-
ers typically are not pursuing professional gaming, but the
league brings in serious competition and thousands of dol-
lars in prize money.

How Ann Arbor s
emo revival shaped
my college years

in this new series, three daily arts writers
in varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.

National Championship

n a city like Ann Arbor,
things come and go: busi-
nesses, students, music
and interests. We're in and out;
we come and go. Sometimes, I
think of the
University
as institu-
tionalizing
the fleet-
ing nature
of life. You
settle into
a home for
four years, JOHN
and then BOHN
you're off.
The shifting
landscape endlessly produces
new interests, new humor and
new nostalgia.
Lately, a lot of buzz has been
made about Ann Arbor as the
center of an emo revival in music.
Ever since I entered college, I've
been around, or a part of, this
scene. The summer after my
freshman year, the bands that
give the town its revival reputa-
tion were taking flight, and over
the past two years, I've watched
them grow into what they
are today. Going into college,
though, this was not the type of
music that I listened to. But as I
attended more shows, and even-
tually went on a short tour with
the groups, their music grew on
me.
To get a better understand-
ing of the tradition that has so
vividly colored my college expe-
rience thus far, I sat down with
my friend Chris Lieu, guitarist
and lyricist of Brave Bird, to talk
about the revival and what it's
like to try and make a name in
this kind of place.
"Scenes like Chicago, L.A. or
Boston, they're always going to
exist," Lieu said. "A scene in Ann
Arbor could be a very fleeting
deal. It really is up to a few peo-
ple to put everything they have
into it and completely devote
themselves to it."
Brave Bird released its first
EP, Ready or Not, two summers
ago and, along with fellow Ann
Arbor-based band "Pity Sex,"

OK. Sit down. Trey scored two. Good. So, I should preface this by saying
I don't know anything about basketball. Or the Michigan Basketball team.
Or, really, sports in general. I bought season tickets last year, but didn'tgo to
more than, like, two or three games.
Why are people arguing about goaltending? I'm glad the colors areteasy to
tell apart. Trey Burke is really good. Wow. Just realized we're playing Lou-
isville. Are they the Louisville sluggers? I'm a dragon. I've already gotten
sidetracked. We're still winning. Well, not thatwe were. Because it was tied.
But we're winning again, so good.
Checking in 20 minutes later. Still high. Oh, God, Highland cows are the
cutest. Apparently we're still winning. This is good. People are falling a lot.
And cheering. Where is Burke? What is happening? I think right now the
only things I know about basketball are "Trey Burke" and that it is actually
played with a ball, but no basket.
What's the deal with halftime? OK, there's a literal basket, but not made of
wood. All right, so, we're only up - NOW DOWN - by one. What is happen-
ing? This is terrifying and terrible. Good thing free throws exist, apparently.
What's the deal with halftime? We are DOWN and it is five minutes into the
second half. Burke got dunked attempting to dunk. You know what sounds
amazing right now? Candy. Or M&Ms. We're down. Everything is happen-
ing so quickly. And now we're down by five. Listen. I'm REALLY hungry.
I'm going to eat.
Trey Burke happened and now we're only down by two. Louisville play-
ers are really dramatic. Trey Burke happened again, and now we're only f
down by three. Are we time-traveling? THAT WAS A SUPER INTENSE
SCRAMBLE THOUGH, but I feel like something should've been fouled
there. Burke just went face-to-court. That looked brutal. Is Burke going to
recover? I'm no expert, but these refs seem to be prettybullshit. Burke isstill
killing it though. Minus the part that we're down by like eight at 3:52 and I
am STRESSING OUT. And after a nerve wracking trio of minutes we lose.
Basketball is really stressful to watch.
- DAILY ARTS WRITER
So, like, this whole basketball thing is a big deal apparently. I mean, I've
been following the season pretty religiously, but mainly because I'm attract-
ed to the athletes. Sorry'bout it.
My love affair with Mitch McGary is pretty well documented; if I do say
so myself.I'm prettysureI've confessed myloveto himinevery format other
than walking up to him and handing him my number. I know, believe me I
know, he's a freshman and I'm a senior, but I'm all about that forbidden love.
I think I can count four pitchers of Oberon on our makeshift table, com-
plete with those orange slices that I'm convinced are only there for decora-
tion - oh, wait, there're two more pitchers at the end over yonder. Seriously,
these tables go on forever.
What I remember of the first half is screaming for Spike's on-fire three's,
running around the bar high-fiving strangers and then promptly shutting
up when that bearded Louisville looker responded with his own run. Dafuq
just happened? 4
Second half = death. Hello, sir. Waiter, sir? Over here. I'll have another
drink now.
We're losing, we're losing, WHYARE WE LOSING?! Um,referees, please
use those things in your face holes called eyes. I'm trying to refrain from too
many profanities, but that call on Trey's block? That's straight bullshit. Ugh.
Wait, it's over? It's over. This can't be happening. This feeling is not nice.
I do not like this feeling at all. I think I could cry? 4
Well, pass me that pitcher and fill 'er up, bub. It's time to bury myself in
it. Go blue.
-RADHIKA MENON
There have been few moments in my life that have held this much sad-
ness and pride at once. As I watched the last minute of the National Cham-
pionship game go by, I realized that I had never taken stock into how much
love and admiration I have for the University. Because I finally understood,
watching the basketball team gracefully admit defeat, that this was far more
than a basketball game - it was the culmination of my time at the University
and its spiriL.
It's not just about who wins; it's not about being a fan or about cheering
the loudest. It's about having immense pride for where you are - for the
school, for the people, for the opportunities. It was only when I saw us lose
(after so many months of hoping and crossing our fingers) that I understood
how we've already won. It's incredibly clich, but what makes a team great
isn't the amount of titles acquiredbut the amount of dedication, respect and
work put into the effort. It resonates with every student. We all lose and
win on our own merit, but what never changes is how decidedly thrilled
and excited we are by our prospects, by our futures. And though we're not
champions, we are, and always will be, Wolverines.

ESPORTS
From Page l B
With "StarCraft II: Heart of
the Swarm" becoming the stan-
dard for competition, players
have had to adapt to its faster
pace and limitless new strate-
gic opportunities. At the first
Major League Gaming tourna-
ment of the year, commentators
and spectators alike could not
help but comment on the breath
of life the expansion had infused
"StarCraft II" with.
"Everyone feels really, really
good about how 'Heart of the
Swarm' plays now," Plott said.
Making sure the professional
scene is faring well in the face
of new changes is a priority for
any company whose game is
being played competitively, and
changes are rolled out on a regu-
lar basis.
"There's a lot more strategy
(and) a lot more room for risk,"
Leung added. New units, maps
and tournament structures
have fostered the development
of aggressive and action-packed
matches. Players regularly exe-
cute upwards of 250 actions per
minute, each one essential to
maximize efficiency and clinch
victory.,
A potential for a career
In 2012 alone, nearly $4 mil-
lion was distributed in prize
money for "StarCraft II" tour-
naments, with 134 tournaments
boasting prize pools greater
than $1000. The opportunity
to make a living by playing,
streaming and winning is there.
The opportunity to be recog-
nized and go pro in eSports is
there.
Plott's manifesto on eSports,
available on his site, describes
the broad, all-inclusive nature
of the community:
"We believe that our game,
'StarCraft,' is as dynamic and
exciting a spectator sport as any
other," he said. "We think you
should be one of us."
But, as a spectator sport,
what does the future of this
industry hold?
"This might be kind of upset-
ting to some people, but person-
ally I don't think that eSports
needs to be on television and-I
don't think that it needs to be on
general broadcasting," George
Georgallidis, professional "LoL"

gamer and online personality,
said. "Entertainment that we see
today and enjoy is evolving. Peo-
ple my age aren't watching TV as
much anymore."
Georgallidis, known inside
the loosening but still pres-
sure-sealed world of gaming as
HotshotGG, is the founder and
owner of Counter Logic Garp-
ing, one of the first sponsored
"LoL" teams that continues to
maintain a sizeable online fol-
lowing. He began his career
much like anyone else inter-
ested in video games - by get-
ting his hands on as many as
he could, eventually discov-
ering and falling in love with
the Multiplayer Online Battle
Arena genre after playing the
independently developed mod
of "Warcraft III," "Defense of
the Ancients."
After the release of "LoL" and
the formation of his team, Geor-
gallidis discovered he could pull
thousands of viewers online to
watch his live stream on the CLG
website, allowing him to make a
sizeable income from advertis-
ing and professional sponsor-
ships for the CLG brand.
"I would never have left (col-
lege) if I didn't have the success
I did with livestreaming. There
has to be a potential for me to
live off 'League of Legends,' "
Georgallidis said. "As long as
there's that potential, I could
take that risk and for me, it paid
off."
But is that risk worth taking
for someone who's relatively
new to the scene? The numbers,
though daunting from a dis-
tance, certainly indicate that
"LoL" as a spectator-driven
sport has the potential to expe-
rience explosive growth, but as
Georgallidis indicated, it has
to be channeled efficiently and
.with the understanding that
eSports is breakingnew ground.
This isn't football. This isn't
basketball. And it never will be.
The appeal of simplicity
"(Five, 10 years from now),
I see it somewhere around the
level of NASCAR," Mona Zhang,
CSL community outreach rep-
resentative, joked. "No, I think
it will always be a niche game
simply because .. basketball
and football are mandatory in
gym; they'll never be the same.
If every kid in America was able
to get into 'League of Legends,'

I don't doubt that there could be
a revolution."
Of the millions that play
worldwide (recent reports by
Riot Games, the company that
created the game, indicate
approximately a billion hours of
playtime logged every month),
over 8 million tuned into the
Season Two World Champion-
ships held in Los Angeles last
October. Riot took notice, intro-.
ducing the League Champion-
ship Series.
Commonly referred to as
LCS, or simply The League,
the weekly match format gives
players and spectators alike an
organized medium to experi-
ence the professional scene.
Polished and slickly arranged,
the online shows are designed
to mimic professional sports
airings in every way. There's a
play-by-play analysis desk, com-
mentators shepherding along
viewers through every crucial
development in every match
and even weekly highlight reels
for all the teams.
It's funded almost solely by
Riot Games, which also pro-
vides the salary for professional
players and subs in addition to
most of the tournament prize
pools.
"The competitive scene is
Riot right now - it is the LCS,"
said Zhang. "But in the case that
Riot was not there, and they
were not funding these tour-
naments, I still think the com-
munity would come up with
something."
Part of that community
has been brought together by
organizations like CSL, which
originally sponsored collegiate
tournaments for "StarCraft"
but has since branched into
"LoL" after taking note of the
game's immediate mass appeal.
"'StarCraft' will always be
the birth place of eSports for
me," Zhang said. "It definitely
did kick off things in Korea,
but now with 'League of Leg-
ends,' we have so many more
people playing. There would
be maybe a few Brood Wards
players before, but now we're
getting hundreds of 'League of
Legends' players at a single col-
lege."
"League of Legend" 's appeal
has largely been a result of its
simplicity - the relative ease
with which new players can
pick up the game and find a
place within the community. Of

course, it doesn't hurt that the
game is free; the only voluntary
expense is the purchase of Riot
Points that allow players to pick
up customized skins for char-
acters and other add-ons that
don't affect overall gameplay.
Nurturing a competitive
scene
"I think 'StarCraft' will have
the same or similar fan base
throughout its lifespan. The
only reason 'League of Leg-
ends' is more popular is simply
because it's an easier game to
pick up," said Sam Li, an LSA
junior and the University's LoL
Club vice president. "It was
built from the ground up to be
an easy game to learn, and yet
the skill floor is pretty low but
the skill ceiling is decently high,
which is why it's such a compet-
itive game."
The palpable difference in
skill level, further highlighted
by the straightforwardness of
the game, allows "LoL" to be
instrumental in nurturing a
competitive scene.
"There's a whole enterprise
around having people watch
the game, and at the same time,
if you're good enough, you now
have the opportunity to play
professionally," Li said.
But at the end of the day,
choosing to have a career in
this industry is still very much
a gamble. Li, for example, is
hesitant to refer to himself as
a professional player, instead
calling his experience playing
"LoL" competitively "semi-pro-
fessional."
"Stay in school," Zhang said.
"An education is irreplaceable.
There are a lot of avenues into
the professional scene now, but
these collegiate leagues exist
specifically to let you pursue
your education and your gam-
ing career."
Georgallidis added that it
depends on whether or not
you're willing to look past the
glamour and fame.
"A lot of the people I know
never really got into the scene
for the money," Georgallidis
said. "It's about getting paid
to do something you love. That
seems like a far-fetched idea at
this point but if you have the
skill to back it up and really
want to make this your career, I
say go for it. Not doing so would
be an opportunity missed."

Every week, people gather in the basement of Get Your Game On to trade and play Magic: The Gathering cards GYGO also sels vintage video game consoles, such as N64 and SNES.
Local gamers educate, entertain in A

Get Your Game On,
Digital Ops create
inclusive community
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily B-Side Editor
"Steam? What's that?" asked
Alex Horvath, owner ofGet Your
Game On, the recognizable local
video game store that recently
moved to a new location on
South State Street.
Steam, in so many terms, is
an online service developed by
Valve Corporation to sell games
and downloadable content at
ridiculously cheap prices. It's
almost singlehandedly the rea-
son PC games have skyrock-
eted in popularity over the last
couple years, and in a context
more relatable to GYGO, one of
the most important reasons why
local game shops might become
sidelined in the years to come.
"We're pretty much the only
store in the area that does retro
gaming," said store manager
Stuart Parnes. "For the people
that want classics like Nintendo,

Super Nintendo and Sega, you
can't really download it off of
Steam, so there's that whole col-
lectability aspect, which I think
a lot of our customers are into."
A loyal customer base, com-
posed mostly of University
students, provided the initial
impetus for the move to a more
accessible location. Previously,
the store had been located on
State Street and Packard Street
- out of the waybutstill drasing
a large amount of students inter-
ested in purchasing old-fash-
ioned video games, card games
and board games.
"Most of our customers would
walk in and say that we needed
to move," Horvath said. "There's
been an almost immediately
noticeable effect on business
because we've retained the old
customer base and managed to
let more people know that we're
here."
And yet, competition still
exists in the form of larger,
chain names like GameStop. But
Parnes stresses that catering to a
niche helps eliminate abit of that
direct struggle for customers.
"This in particular is very dif-

ferent from a lot of businesses in
the sense that I know a lot of our
customers on a first name basis,"
Partes said. "People come in not
just for the store but also to have
a conversation. It's a retail store
but a place to hang out as well."
The sense of community
comes from a collective nos-
talgia that many college-aged
gainers associate with their first
experience holding a control-
ler. According to Parnes, that
nostalgia is what has allowed
more personal stores like GYGO
to maintain customers willing
to walk in and talk with fellow
gainers.
"I hear all the time when
people come in, 'Oh I had all
these games as a kid, but then my
mom sold them at a garage sale,'
" Parnes said. "They want to go
back and play all those games
that they used to have when they
were kids, and a lot of it is that
nostalgia."
At the same time, the market
continues to remain dynamic as
new students filter into college.
"College kids, right now, are
really into Nintendo but in a few
years maybe it'll be Super Nin-

tendo. I think that it'll keep shift-
ingup," Parnes said.
A few minutes' walk down to
East Liberty Street lies a differ-
ent kind of community - one
that remains anchored in the
same unapologetically nostal-
gic gaming culture that Parnes
described. Confined within the
basement of a shared work-
space, Digital Ops, now a part of
All Hands Active, is an amalga-
mation of Local Area Network
gaming center and makeshift
electronics lab.
In one corner of the room
rests a large couch occupied by
high-school students, intense
eyes locked on a flat-screen TV
as they close out a tightly con-
tested Smash session ("Super
Smash Brothers: Brawl" for all
the nOObs). The other half of the
basement is littered with circuit
boards and tools. An elderly man,
choosing to give only his first
name, Bill, sits hunched behind
a magnifying lens, soldering iron
in hand.
"Originally it was the gam-
ing," Josh Williams, educa-
tion coordinator for All Hands
Active, said when asked what

got him involved in the organi-
zation. "And nowadays, it's the
.idea of creating an atmosphere
where geeky people can just
hang out. You don't have a lot of
that in reality. Where else can
you find a place where someone
interested in physics or math or
programming or electronics can
just come and talk?"
The LAN center gets most of
its revenue by renting out a ring
of five PCs to college students
who regularly gather on week-
nights to play co-op games.
"There's lots of 'League (of
Legends)' being played right
now," Williams said. "We're
only open to the public for 40
hours a week; other than that it's
member access, but you can find
someone here almost every night
after 9 p.m. on one of the com-
puters playing'League."'
In the past, the organization
has hosted and sponsored large
"LoL" tournaments showcas-
ing The Cube, a large robot-like
contraption built specifically for.
five versus five-team-oriented
games, where players sit on top
of and inside the machine, which
is attached to five function-

ing PCs. As the organization is
largely run by volunteers, funds
collected from such exhibitions
are used to maintain the organi-
zation's philanthropic efforts in
the community.
As a part of All Hands Active,
Digital Ops is contracted by
Eastern Michigan University to
reach out to at-risk youths. The
program, commonly referred to
as Bright Futures, is meant to
further facilitate the idea that
Digital Ops can be a place for
students to foster an interest in
technology related fields.
Katherine Wiykovics, after-
school teacher for All Hands
Active, held up a small pin con-
nected to two LED lights. The
pin, in the shape of a robot, was
used by Digital Ops staff mem-
bers to teach elementary- and
middle-school students about
the basics of circuitry and elec-
tronics.
"This place is about build-
ing a community around doing
things on your own," Wiykovics
said. "It's about teaching kids
how to build these things I had
no idea even existed when I was
their age."
