Regents approve
renovations to Big
House, Crisler and
Yost Ice Arena
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
At its meeting yesterday, the
University's Board of Regents
approved proposals to continue
renovations of Crisler Arena and
to install high-definition score-
boards at Michigan Stadium,
Crisler Arena and Yost Ice Arena.
As outlined in the proposals,
the approved $52 million expan-
sion to Crisler Arena will add an
estimated 63,000 square feet,
including new public entrances,
club spaces, ticketing areas and
additional retail facilities. The
expansion will also improve dis-
ability seating and increase fan
amenities.
These additions will mark the
second phase of the Crisler Arena
renovation project. The first
phase of the project - approved
by the Board of Regents in Octo-
ber 2010 - addressed high-priori-
ty issues like electrical wiring and
plumbing.
University Athletic Director
Dave Brandon wrote in a press
release issued yesterday that the
second phase of renovations will
modernize the arena.
"Our goal is to create a home
court advantage for our teams
while making the fan experience

memorable from the moment they
walk into the arena," Brandon
wrote in the release.
He also said that he is very
excited about the LED video
scoreboard installations, which
will cost an estimated $20 mil-
lion.
"These new boards will pro-
vide our fans with the opportuni-
ty for enhanced and crystal clear
viewing of not only the event but
of replays, announcements, and
other fun ways to create game day
excitement," Brandon wrote.
'U' TO CONTINUE STRONG
FOCUS ON RESEARCH
In a presentation earlier in the
meeting, Stephen Forrest, the
University's vice president for
research, summarized the state
of research at the University.
He emphasized the need for the
University to remain devoted to
innovation in order to support the
state and national economies.
Forrest said the University is
ranked in the top tier of research
institutions in the nation, placing
eighth in the country between
2007 and 2009 for research agree-
ments and business start-ups, and
ninth for revenue generated.
The University's research
spending exceeded $1 billion
this year for the second year in a
row, according to the University's
Annual Report on Research and
Scholarship.
University researchers have
received about $300 million in

Business and LSA
students receive
comparable services
By AUSTIN WORDELL
For the Daily
Contrary to popular belief,
career planning programs aren't
limited to pre-professional stu-
dents at the University.
And while some may think the
career services offered for LSA

students differ from those offered
through pre-professional schools,
according to the directors of the-
University's Career Center and
pre-professional career centers,
any perceived differences among
the centers can be attributed to
the more career-oriented nature
of pre-professional majors.
Kerin Borland, director of the
Career Center, said students who
pursue degrees in disciplines with
more career-specific programs
like business or engineering may
have an easier time finding ser-

vices that cater to their needs.
LSA students often take longer to
decide what specific type ofcareer
they want to pursue, she said.
"Students who choose to pur-
sue a major that is offered through
the Business School are making
a two-in-one decision," Borland
said. "With a liberal arts major,
they still have to take that two-
step process. They have to decide
a major, and then they have to
decide a career focus."
Damian Zikakis, director of
the Office of Career Development

at the Ross School of Business,
echoed Borland's sentiments, say-
ing that LSA students often aren't
on a set career path, while busi-
ness students are more directed
based on their curriculum.
He said that occasionally an
LSA student will call the Business
School asking to take advantage
of services they think are exclu-
sively offered there. However the
student often has not met with a
career counselor to see what the
University's Career Center has to

Officials worry drivers
will continue texting


'U' researcher
foresees violations
of statewide law
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
About eight months after tex-
ting while driving became illegal
in Michigan, local officials say
the ban is permeating driving
culture. But some drivers still
have one hand on the wheel and

the other on the phone.
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm turned Michigan House
Bill 4394 into law with her sig-
nature on Apr. 30, 2010. The law
prohibits drivers from reading,
writing or sending text messages
while driving.
Prior tothe statewide legisla-
tion, the Ann Arbor CityCoun-
cil proposed a citywide ban on
all hand-held electronic devices
while driving. The proposal was
dropped after the state law was
passed.

As Ann Arbor City Council
member Stephen Rapundalo (D-
Ward 2) explained, the passage
of the state legislation eliminated
the need for a city ordinance.
In drafting the city proposal,
Rapundalo consulted with Paul
Green, a research professor at
the University's Transportation
Research Institute.
Green has testified twice
before the state legislature on the
risks of using hand-held electron-
ic devices while driving. He said

CAMPUS COMMUNITY
Women's Studies students petition
for gender neutrality on Facebook

JAKE FROMM/Daily
Crows fly around campus in November. According to Robert Payne, professor emeritus of zoology at the University, there are
about 10,000 crows in Ann Arbor during the winter months.
Influx of crows on'U' campus
result of routine bird behavior

Class project aims to
add gender-neutral
identity option
By JENNA SIMARD
Daily StaffReporter
Many Facebook groups are
formed by students seeking to
advocate for or against a cause.
But one group started by Univer-
sity students is targeting an issue

concerning the social network
itself.
The group, which was created
by three University students as
a project for a Women's Studies
class last semester, advocates for
gender neutrality on Facebook
and suggests that users have a
gender-neutral option for those
who don't identify as either male
or female.
LSA senior Cecilia Innes, co-
founder of the group, said the
initiative called "I Choose Neu-

tral" is a product of an assignment
given to students in Women's
Studies 240 last semester. The
project, called the Praxis Project,
is based on the idea that Women's
Studies should combine theory
and activism, Innes wrote in an
e-mail interview.
"The idea behind 'I Choose
Neutral' is one of equality and
respect to the individuals using
Facebook," Innes wrote.
The ultimate goal is to get

'U' zoology expert:
crows gather in
winter months
By JENNIFER DOMINGUE
Daily StaffReporter
Students walking around cam-,
pus in the evening may some-
times feel like they're in their
very own Hitchcock film.
And while students don't have
to worry about being pecked to

death by birds any time soon,
there has been a recent influx
of crows congregating in areas
like the Nichols Arboretum, For-
est Hill Cemetery and the Diag,
among others.
Robert Payne, professor emer-
itus of zoology at the University,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
he believes the increase in crows
is a result of a habitual tendency
of the species. The crows gather
in large numbers during the
winter and early spring months,
finding security in tall trees,

wrote Payne, who is also a cura-
tor emeritus of birds at the Muse-
um of Zoology at the University.
The Ann Arbor crow popula-
tion is at an estimated 10,000
birds during the winter, com-
pared to a few hundred during
warmer months, according to
Payne. However, the Washtenaw
Audubon Society counted almost
30,000 crows in Ann Arbor in
the group's annual Christmas
Bird Count on Dec. 20, 2010.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
South Korea said yesterday it
accepted a North Korean pro-
posal to hold high-level defense
talks a day after the leaders of the
U.S. and China called for better
communication between the two
Koreas.
The talks could prove signifi-
cant if Seoul and Pyongyang can
put aside military and political
tensions that soared to their worst
level in years in 2010 and lay the
groundwork for a resumption of
long-stalled international nego-
tiations on ending North Korea's
nuclear programs. Lower-level
defense talks last year foundered
over the issue of the sinking of a

and not provoke further tensions,
said Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman
for South Korea's Unification Min-
istry, which is in charge of inter-
Korean affairs.
North Korea launched artil-
lery at a South Korean island in
November in an attack that killed
four people. It denies, however,
attacking the navy ship that sank
in March, killing 46 sailors.
Inter-Korean relations have
been complicated by a power
transition under way in the
North, where leader Kim Jong
Il is believed to be grooming his
youngest son Kim Jong Un to
succeed him. Some analysts say
the ship sinking and the artillery
attack were carried out to display

the two incidents. South Korea's
Defense Ministry said the North
suggested talks at the level of min-
ister.
The ministry said it would sug-
gest preliminary meetings to dis-
cuss the timing and other details
of the talks.
South Korea will also propose
separate talks with North Korea
to verify its commitment toward
denuclearization, Lee said.
North Korea's state news agen-
cy was silent on the proposed
defense talks.
South Korea had rejected earli-
er North Korean calls for uncondi-
tional dialogue as insincere. South
Korea has also called for an apol-
ogy from the North.

Philadelphia abortion murder
case incites national debate

Activists decry
alleged offenses of
abortion clinic doctor
NEW YORK (AP) - The allega-
tions of murder at a Philadelphia
abortion clinic add fuel to already
heated national debate over late-
term abortions and oversight of
providers. One side wants tougher
restrictions; the other says women
would be safer if they had more
options.
Almost in unison, abortion-rights
and anti-abortion activists decried
the alleged offenses of Dr. Kermit
Gosnell, who was arraigned yes-
terday on eight counts of murder
in the deaths of seven babies and
one patient. He allegedly provided
illegal late-term abortions for up to
$3,000 while avoiding a crackdown
despite numerous complaints and
lawsuits.
"This provider clearly operates
outside acceptable quality care

standards and is a total outlier," said
National Abortion Federation presi-
dent Vicki Saporta. "The majority
of providers offer very high quality
care."
The problem with the Gosnell
case, Saporta said, is that state and
local authorities apparently didn't
enforce regulations that were on the
books. She noted that Gosnell had
been rejected for membership in her
federation, which represents about
400 providers accounting for about
half the nation's 1.2 million annual
abortions.
The federation has a self-policing
policy, conducting periodic site vis-
its to ensure that members comply
with its guidelines.
Anti-abortion activists say self-
policing, as well as existing regula-
tions in many states, are insufficient.
They have been pushing for years
for tighter oversightof abortion pro-
viders, and the Gosnell case is likely
to intensify those efforts.
Yesterday, for example, a legisla-
tive committee in Virginia endorsed

a bill that would subject abortion
clinics - which are now regulated
like doctors' offices - to the same
standards as outpatient surgical
centers.
"It's hard to tell the extent of
egregious offenders because the
abortion industry is almost com-
pletely unregulated," said Dr. Donna
Harrison of Eau Claire, Mich., pres-
ident of the American Association
of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists.
"If a doctor in a hospital did a hys-
terectomy and had a patient with a
complication, he would have to go
back and explain why to his col-
leagues," Harrison said. "With abor-
tion, the doctor has nobody to face
- they basically just slide through
the accountability process with
nobody to hold their feet to the fire."
In general, abortion-rights activ-
ists have opposed the state-level
efforts to regulate abortion clinics
more tightly, depictingthese bills as
backdoor attempts to shut down the
clinics altogether.

Chicago mayor
spearheads efforts
to strengthen U.S.-
China relationship
CHICAGO (AP) - Mayor Rich-
ard Daley's long effort to build ties
with the world's second-largest
economy seemed to pay off yes-
terday as Chinese President Hu
Jintao arrived for his first visit
to Chicago, his only stop outside
Washington duringthis trip.
Hu was expected to focus on
economic ties between China and
Chicago during his whirlwind
overnight visit to the city. Experts
said the attention from China has
been the envy of other U.S. cities
and could mark a gigantic - and
profitable - step forward for both
parties, despite the sometimes
rocky U.S.-China relationship.
. "Our long range goal is to make
Chicago the most China-friendly
cityin the U.S.," Daleysaid duringa
dinner last night attended by Hu, as
well as Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, top
city officials and business leaders.
Many have credited Daley's
efforts so far. The mayor has trav-
eled to China four times since
2004, touting Chicago as a global
transportation hub with large

manufacturing and industrial sec-
tors friendly to Chinese business.
"Chicago deserves some kudos.
It's clear that he's (Daley) cultivat-
ed the China relationship and he's
learned how to do that very well,"
said Kenneth Lieberthal, direc-
tor of the John L. Thornton China
Center at the Brookings Insti-
tution. "Mayors and governors
around the country, regardless of
their politics, see China as a source
of potential capital, markets and
jobs. So you better be ones look-
ing to have the president of China
come here."
Hu, speaking to last night's
dinner through a translator, also
praised the city's efforts to build
relationships through language
and business.
"Despite the great distance
between Chicago and China, our
hearts are linked together by
friendship,"he said. He earlier con-
gratulated Daley on his 22 years in
office, calling him "the most senior
mayor in America."
The retiring Democratic mayor
has largely stayed away from poli-
tics in developing a relationship
with China. He went to Shang-
hai last year to headline "Chicago
Days" at the 2010 World Expo. In
2008, he went to the Beijing Olym-
pics to look for lessons for Chica-
go's 2016 Summer Olympics bid.

He has avoided criticizing China
for human rights issues and stayed
away from U.S. manufacturers'
claims that China undervalues
its currency to make its exports
cheaper than U.S. products, con-
tributing to high unemployment
here.
In 2006, Daley pushed for the
development of the Confucius
Institute in Chicago, a language
and cultural center that started
as a small parent-driven Chinese
language program. It's now one of
the largest institutes of its kind in
North America; about 12,000 Chi-
cago public school students take
Chinese and the institute offers
community classes and interna-
tional exchanges for teachers.
While the institute doesn't have
direct ties to business, leaders in
Chicago's Chinatown say it helps
forge a connection.
"It creates a whole generation of
younger students and future lead-
ers to understand Chinese culture
and language. It will help the busi-
ness transaction," said Tony Shu,
president of the Chinatown Cham-
ber of Commerce. "If you know
the language, you'll find it so much
easier."
Hu was expected to visit the
institute on Friday, as well as a
Chinese business expo in the sub-
urbs.

Bills introduced
to lower autism
treatment costs
Michigan lawmakers are renew-
ing efforts to require the offering
of insurance coverage for certain
autism treatments.
Bills were introduced this week
in the state Senate. Democratic
Sen. Tupac Hunter of Detroit said
yesterday the insurance coverage
is needed to help families that can't
afford the costs of certain autism
treatments for their children.
More than 20 other states have
similar laws, but the Michigan
measure is opposed by business
and insurance groups that say man-
dating coverage would raise the
cost of employer-sponsored health
insurance.
Supporters of the measure say
it's an issue of fairness and that it
would save Michigan money in the
long run.
The proposal to require autism
insurance coverage stalled in the
Senate last year. Bills are being
reintroduced for the 2011-12 legis-
lative session.

Pair of pandas
remain at zoo for
breeding tests
National Zoo and Chinese con-
servation officials have signed a
deal extending the stay of Wash-
ington's two beloved pandas.
The $2.75 million deal signed by
the Smithsonian National Zoo and
China Wildlife Conservation Asso-
* ciation yesterday at the zoo's panda
exhibit allows 12-year-old Mei
Xiang and 13-year-old Tian Tian to
stay until 2015. The pair arrived at
the zoo in 2000.
The deal was first announced
Wednesday.
The agreement calls for Chinese
scientists and breeding experts to
visit the National Zoo to try new
breeding methods. Also, if they
aren't able to breed after two years,
one or both of the pandas could
be switched out for others from
China.
Any cub born to the pair would
now be allowed to stay four years,
instead of the previous limit of two.
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia
Monument honors
Holocaust victims
A new monument was unveiled
yesterday in eastern Canada mark-
ing the country's decision to turn
away a steamship carrying Jewish
refugees fleeing Nazi Germany in
1939.
The luxury liner MS St. Louis
was first turned away by Cuba,
' then the United States and final-
ly Canada before returning to
Europe just before the outbreak of
war.
Of the 900 German Jews
aboard, almost a third died in the
Holocaust.
The sculpture by Daniel Libe-

skind, called the Wheel of Con-
science and unveiled in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, is the centerpiece of
a $476,000 national project aimed
at educating Canadians.
"It tells the story of a tragedy, a
dark period of Canadian history,
where anti-Semitism and anti-
immigration policies led to the
murder of hundreds of people and
the suffering of hundreds of oth-
ers," said Libeskind.
PARIS
WikiLeaks cited in
terrorism trial
Lawyers for ex-inmates of the
Guantanamo prison camp used
documents released by WikiLeaks
to argue for their acquittal in a
French terrorism trial yesterday.
Five Frenchmen held at the
prison were acquitted by a French
appeals court of terrorism charges
in 2009, in a high-profile disavow-
al of the camp. But then a new trial
was ordered.
As that trial opened yesterday,
defense lawyers presented at least
three U.S. diplomatic cables citing
French anti-terrorist investiga-
tors.
The lawyers argued that it was
inappropriate for French inves-
tigators to have discussed the
ex-inmates' cases with American
authorities.
The prosecutor dismissed the
argument and urged the court to
sentence the five to one-year pris-
on terms. The defendants were not
present at yesterday's trial.

enough members to attract the
attention of Facebook adminis-
trators, Innes wrote. She added
that Facebook has become a huge
part of people's lives, so the way
gender is represented on the site
can have major social ramifica-
tions.
"If enough people ask for their
product to change, as a com-
pany producing this product,
they should change it," Innes
wrote. "But, really, the idea goes
beyond Facebook itself - if we
can change the way our genera-
tion views gender, through Face-
book asa vehicle, we can start the
discussion of inclusion in a wider
format. Right now this seems to
be an invisible issue."
Facebook does give users the
option to not display their gen-
der, but according to Innes and

another for security, often not
coming back to the same place,"
Payne wrote.
According to Payne, this pat-
tern is a more recent develop-
ment.
"They didn't do this when I
was a student in the 1950s," Payne
wrote. "We think that, being
intelligent, they have learned
safety in being in towns."
Earlier this month, MLive.com
reported that 19 crows had been
found dead in Ann Arbor, the
majority of which were uncov-
ered near North Campus and
along railroad tracks close to
the Gandy Dancer restaurant on
Depot St. It was determined the
crows died of poisoning, accord-
ing to the article.
Though some may think the
deaths may be linked to mysteri-
ous mass bird deaths across the
country, Payne wrote that they
aren't related.
"Recent mass deaths of birds in
other parts of the U.S. appear to
be due to pesticides and to birds

the group's other co-founders,
LSA sophomores Lindsey Olson
and Nicole Tillem, this doesn't
address the issue of gender neu-
trality.
"The idea here is two-fold,"
Innes wrote. "The first is to
respect that gender is not binary,
and even if you don't show gen-
der, you are forced to be complicit
with the idea that you are either-
or.Youhave to dealwithpronouns
that you may not believe respond
to you as an individual. Secondly,
not displaying your sex is just
making the issue more invisible
- literally. You are erasing your
gender, ratherthan embracingit."
The "I Choose Neutral" Face-
book group has gotten more
than 150 "likes" on the site since
its founding in the beginning of
November.
One of the group's supporters,
LSA junior Leyla Bozer, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
recently realized that choosing a
being disturbed at night (by lights
and noise) and flying around and
crashing into power lines," Payne
wrote. "The Ann Arbor crows
don't have this problem."
About 5,000 dead blackbirds
were discovered in Beebe, Ark.
on Dec. 31, according to a Jan. 3
article in The New York Times.
It is believed the birds died from
"'acute physical trauma"' as a
result of nearby fireworks, The
New York Times reported.
Several days later, about 500
birds were found dead on a high-
way in Louisiana, according to a
Jan. 4 MSNBC.com article.
Though some students said
they haven't noticed large groups
of crows on campus, others, like
Engineering freshman Brian
Miller, said they've been scared
by nearby swarms of crows.
"They're a major threat," Mill-
er said.
Miller described his encounter
with the birds around 2 a.m. one
night when he and a friend were
walking through the Diag.
"As we were walking there,
we were talking about the crows,
and how terrifying they are," he
said. "We were looking around to
make sure they weren't there, and

gender on Facebook would be dif-
ficult for many people. She said
that Facebook, being one of the
largest social networking web-
sites, should take all its members
into account.
"Facebook is supposed to be a
place where you can express your
identity as you see it, and you
should be able to display whatev-
er aspects of your personal iden-
tity you choose to reveal," Bozer
wrote.
Bozer and Innes both wrote
that while there may be certain
conflicts with the site's preva-
lence of pronoun usage and gen-
der-targeted advertising, there's
no reason why this should limit
users' identities on their profiles.
"There is really no excuse for
the exclusion of non-gendered
persons," Innes wrote. "Facebook
should be held accountable to all
of its users, including those who
don't fit easily into the identifica-
tion of male or female."
of course they were, in four or five
trees."
Miller said once they saw the
crows, he and his friend started
running, trying to avoid being
defecated on.
"I thought, 'Oh God, here we
go. I'm just going to run through'
... They start rustling the leaves
and flapping around.
There was a deafening noise of
crows ... We sprinted the entire
way, not looking back once," Mill-
er said.
Miller had a piece of advice for
others regarding the crow situa-
tion on campus.
"Avoid the Diag after sunset,"
he said.
Other students who've also
noticed the birds around town,
however, have attempted to
actively ward off the flocks.
Business sophomore Michael
Kovach said he often sees crows
sitting in trees near his fraternity
house, Phi Psi, on State Street. He
said he's thrown ice chips at them
before for entertainment purpos-
es, but that they've always flown
away before being harmed.

offer before contacting the Busi-
ness School, he said.
According to Zikakis, 84.5 per-
cent of undergraduates at the Busi-
ness School receive at least one job
offer before graduation. He said the
reason for the high percentage is
due to the business skills taught at
the school that make students more
attractive to specific employers.
"We reach out to companies in
which our students have expressed
an interest and ask them to con-
sider recruiting at Ross," Zikakis
said. "More often, though, we are
contacted by companies that want
to begin recruiting at Ross."
Lauren Rossi, recruiter with
PricewaterhouseCoopers - atcom-
pany that provides assurance, tax
and consulting services - said
while some businesses may be
searching for a more diverse group
of recruits, many students they
interview typically have an exper-
tise in business.
"LSA students are more than
welcome to become a part of (the
company)," Rossi said. "The major-
ity of offerings are for those folks
who are an accounting focus, who
have that business background."
Bret Caldwell, representative for
the sales and marketing company
ZS Associates, said businesses like
his have been branching outside
of their typical business student
recruits.
"We're looking for smart and
quantitatively-oriented people,"
Caldwell said. "We absolutely
recruit across all majors."
Atboththepre-professional cen-
ter and University Career Center,
students have access to a recruit-
ment database of employers who
are coming to campus. The centers
also provide opportunities through
jobs fairs and presentations and
host interview and r6sume-writing
workshops. Additionally, a major
focus of all the centers is emphasiz-
ing networking, the directors of the
centers said.
Borland said the comparative
lack of early career planning by
LSA students fuels the false per-
ception thatthey have fewer career
service opportunities. She said

liberal arts majors typically don't
seek resources early onin college -
something that would help to nar-
row their career objectives.
"If a student takes advantage of
all the things that might lead to
deciding (a career), then the steps
of them pursuing an opportunity
in that area become just as clear
as the marketing major," Borland
said.
She added that because many
companies are looking for well-
rounded students, having a certain
major is becoming less of a factor in
finding jobs after graduation.
"A student's major is having
decreasing impact on who is being
considered for positions," Borland
said. "It's an element, but employ-
ers are really looking at the total
package that a student is bringing
to the table."
Kerri Boivin, director of the
Engineering Career Resource
Center, said all the career centers
on campus are equally devoted to
working with employers to help
them recruit students.
"We all come together as career
services," Boivin said. "We all tend
to offer the same services. I don't
know that anyone is doing any-
thing more than any other career
service office."
Students at Wednesday's Winter
Career Expo agreed that Business
School students have more career
focus, making their job search
more rewarding. LSA senior Kend-
ra Marshall said Business students
seem to take more advantage of the
resources offered to themthanLSA
students.
"I don't think that Business stu-
dents get more resources," Mar-
shall said. "If you actually really
go into your major and under-
stand how to actually talk to the
right people you will get as many
resources as Business students."
LSA senior Matt Shepherd said
he feels that students often over-
look resources the Career Center
offers.
"I feel that the Career Center is
an under utilized resource on cam-
pus, and as an RA in Alice Lloyd;,
I often promote its use among
residents in the building who are
struggling to find their way, look-
ing for a job or preparing for life
after graduation," Shepherd said.


TEXTING
From Page 1
he's concerned that despite the
statewide ban, people will con-
tinue to textwhile driving.
"As market penetration of
phones increases, and as people
make a greater use of texting ...
the frequency of texting while
driving would increase," Green
said. "So what we see now would
only be a small part of the poten-
tial problem."
Green said that while younger
generations tend to text more fre-
quentlythan older individuals, the

population as a whole is becom-
ing more accepting of texting as a
means of communication. Young
adults, however, continue to pose
the highest risk while engaging in
distracted driving.
"Younger drivers tend to be
less experienced and tend to
be less capable at multi-task-
ing while driving, so therefore
they're more susceptible to prob-
lems," Green said. "And if they're
more frequently engaging in tex-
ting, then that compounds the
situation."
While it may not be possible to
completely eliminate the danger
of texting while driving, Green

said the University's Transpor-
tation Research Institute is cur-
rently engaged in research on the
topic. He said they hope to change
the method of texting in the
future by exploring new hands-
free options.
Rapundalo, the lead sponsor of
the former citywide texting pro-
posal, said the ordinance would
have also prohibited drivers from
making phone calls while driv-
ing, in addition to banning all
hand-held electronic devices that
weren't directly fixed to the dash-
board. While the statewide law
doesn't include a ban on talking
on the phone while driving, this

portion of the proposed citywide
ordinance, among others, haven't
been pursued.
The push for such legislation at
the local level came in response to
concerns about distracted driving
'as a result of drivers' use of hand-
held electronic devices, Rapunda-
lo said.
"There was a lot of distracted
driving predominantly due to
the use of hand-held electronic
devices, and (the citywide pro-
posal) was an attempt to mitigate
some of the inherent dangers and
outcomes of that here locally,"
he said. "(It was) pretty much on
par with what other communities

here in Michigan ... have tried to
do or have done."
The initial plans to implement
legislation to ban the use of hand-
held electronic devices in the city
were met with mixed reactions
from city residents, according
to Rapundalo. Some Ann Arbor
residents were concerned that the
proposed ordinance would also
prohibit devices fixed to the dash-
board.
"There was concern that the
languageinitially written ... would
include GPS units," Rapundalo
said. "So we did alot of refining of
the language to ensure that it was
clear."

Nov. 30, 2010, according to a Uni-
versity press release issued yes-
terday.
Though Forrest praised the
University's high caliber research,
he also said there is still room for
improvement.
An important part of maintain-
ing a successful research institu-
tion, Forrest said, is remaining
engaged in the community and
forming partnerships with out-
side groups.
"Universities ...have hard walls
and hard boundaries to the out-
side world," Forrest said. "But (the
University) bleeds right out onto
State Street."
During his presentation, For-
rest also said the University's new
North Campus Research Complex
and the founding of the business
center Venture Accelerator and
Tech Transfer, are significant
developments that help bring
research and ideas into the mar-
ketplace.
After the meeting, University
Regent Andrea Newman (R-Ann
Arbor) also said she appreciates
the emergence of Tech Transfer
- a group that looks for ways to
apply University technology to
the marketplace - among other
University projects.
"It was nice to see the focus on
Tech Transfer because that's so

important," Newman said. "It cre-
ates jobs, it helps the reputation of
the University and it encourages
people to come here."
In an interview after his pre-
sentation, Forrest said that in
addition to developing Venture
Accelerator, he has assembled a
group of entrepreneurial faculty
members to further research at
the University. He added that
though the University conducts
prominent research, it isn't the
"top" institution.
"We're in the middle of getting
(Venture Accelerator) settled and
it's a good time to take a breath
and look for the next step," he
said. "We understand that we
have to move on from here, that
this isn't the end."
Forrest also said he feels
University students should be
involved in research on campus
because they support the overall
research atmosphere.
"I think students should always
be looking for research experienc-
es while they're here," he said. "By
research, I'm talking about any-
thing, whether it's social sciences,
arts, engineering, you name it. Get
involved."
$1.5 MILLION UPGRADE
TO ISR BUILDING APPROVED
The regents approved a $1.5
million improvement to the fire
suppression system in the Univer-
sity's Institute for Social Research
Building at the meeting.
The installation is expected to
be completed in the spring of 2012
and will be funded by the ISR and

the Office of the Provost.
The board also approved a $2.55
million budget to renovate utility
tunnels underneath Central Cam-
pus and Huron Street. The new
project is funded by University
Utilities and will distribute power
to campus from the University's
Central Power Plant.
The construction on the 500
feet of tunnels as well as the
replacement of 120 feet of the
tunnels is expected to be com-
pleted in winter 2012.
CONDUCT OF DPS CHIEF
QUESTIONED DURING
PUBLIC COMMENTS
During the public comments
section following yesterday's
regents meeting, Douglas
Smith, a former University pro-
fessor, submitted a request to
be granted access to records
involving Kenneth Magee, the
executive director of the Uni-
versity's Department of Public
Safety.
Magee is reported to be on
a medical leave of absence, but
Smith said he believes Magee is
on leave because of sexual mis-
conduct allegations.
After the meeting, Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald said Magee is presently on
medical leave and that there is
no investigation into the mat-
ter. Fitzgerald declined to com-
ment further on the allegations
Smith spoke of, reiterating that
there is not an investigation
going on.
Smith said he previously

submitted a request for records
regarding possible allegations
or suspicions of Magee, but that
the University administration
refused to comply on the grounds
of attorney-client privilege.
At yesterday's meeting, Smith
appealed to the Board of Regents

to overturn the denial of his
request.
In an interview following yes-
terday's meeting, University Pres-
ident Mary Sue Coleman declined
to comment on the proposed alle-
gations of sexual harassment and
misconduct by Magee.

Handle it right
A2 should help panhandlers, not pedestrians
Ann Arbor residents may begin avoiding awkward, fre-
quent encounters with panhandlers. In September, the
Ann Arbor City Council formed a task force dedicated
to discouraging panhandling and enforcing ordinances that do
so. Rather than cutting to the core of the problem, City Council
is only scratching the surface by educating Ann Arbor residents
how to deal with panhandlers. City Council needs a system that
helps rehabilitation for panhandlers and homeless people get
off Ann Arbor streets, without dismissing the needs of the Ann
Arbor community.

1 Ann Arbor City Council decided to recon-
vene a panhandling task force, according to
a Jan.17 Daily article. The task force will be
devoted to reducing the number of aggres-
sive panhandlers in Ann Arbor and cutting
costs related to stopping them. The task
force hopes to collaborate with students,
residents and local businesses to address
the city's panhandling issues. The task
force will meet regularly and will coordi-
nate measures with the Ann Arbor Police
Department to increase street patrols.
The panhandling task force is designed
to help educate Ann Arbor residents and
'members of the University community on
how to address panhandlers without giv-
ing them money. But instead of employing
resources to teach people how to politely
say "no" and walk away from a panhan-
dler, the city should be devoting resources
to help the people who actually need help
- the panhandlers. City Council needs
to focus on concrete plans for directing
panhandlers to rehabilitative resources,
'instead of simply sending them away.
While giving panhandlers money doesn't
help them in the long run, havingthe police
disperse them to a new location doesn't
either, Tihe cir op, te task force, City
Council member Sabra Briere (D-Ward

1), talked in the article about problems
facing panhandlers like drug and alcohol
addiction. And yet, instead of getting pan-
handlers proper help, the city is instead
teaching Ann Arbor residents and business
owners how to direct them out of town.
It's important for students and community
members to know how to keep themselves
safe from aggressive panhandling, but it's
also important that City Council recog-
nizes that there are bigger issues than resi-
dents being inconvenienced.
Ann Arbor already has services in place
to work toward rehabilitation efforts for
the homeless. Programs like the Street Out-
reach Court work to keep homeless people
from getting lost in the judicial system for
petty crimes and redirects them to shelters
and other services. Instead of incarcerat-
ing the homeless for petty crimes or giving
them fines that they're unable to pay, it's in
the best interest of the community to chan-
nel these people into places where they're
able to get help.
While panhandlers can create an uncom-
fortable dilemma for people who walk
around Ann Arbor, the goal should be to
help panhandlers contribute to society and

Getting sick is bad, but getting
sick during finals is mortify-
ing. I was fortunate enough
not to be sick dur-
ing finals last term,;
but I did get sick
the week before. I
missed class Tues-
day through Thurs-
day, which included
a statistics lecture
that could have
helped improve my
exam score and a ERIC
theatre history dis- SZKARLAT
cussion that might
have brought my
grade out of the
dump. Ieven had to skip outof working
on a group project because I had a Uni-
versity Health Service appointment,
which killed my presentation and sub-
sequently my grade in that class.
The thing is, I hate to miss class.
I almost never skip, and if or when I
do, it's usually to do other homework
or finish something else that I need
more time for. It's not as if I don't
spend time doing homework. But
it's tough to balance 16 credits with
Marching Band, which is an addi-
tional two credits. If you miss class
or lecture and you miss the material,
you might be completely screwed. I
would hate to be at a disadvantage for
a final exam or pop quiz.
That's why I don't understand
attendance policies. The incentive to
come to class is already there. Making
it part of your final grade? Come on.
Sure, it's nice to have an easy 10
percent of your grade be determined
by participation and attendance. But
having your grade dropped from an

A- to a B+ because you missed three
class periods seems unreasonable.
I know how to prioritize. I think
the majority of the student body has
the cognitive ability to realize that,
sometimes, going to class is a lower
priority than getting sleep or finish-
ing a paper. It's one thing to sleep in
because you're lazy and miss your 8
am. class because you're tired, but
it's a little different if your weekend
was gobbled up by other homework
- or Marching Band, which is also a
class obligation - and you could only
start your paper at 10 p.m. on Sunday.
Sometimes, health comes first. And
why shouldn't it? You could miss class
now and sleep in, or you could sacri-
fice sleep for class and get sick. Either
way, you'll miss class. The difference
is the little note of excuse.
I understand that there are legiti-
mate pedagogical justifications to
mandating attendance. If students
don't come, who is going to discuss
last night's reading? Instructors
think that if they don't require atten-
dance, no one will come to class and
then nothing valuable will be said.
I would suggest just the opposite.
I think if the class content is inter-
esting, accessible and necessary to
know for exams, students will come
no matter what. When I took a lit-
erary studies course, the professor
had no attendance policy. Yet every
day there was still a full classroom.
The discussions went on. Participa-
tion was a part of our grade too, but
attendance didn't affect participation
unless you never went. This way, you'
could skip a few class periods if it was
absolutely necessary. Even in the two
classes I've had where attendance

was not strictly mandated, there was
still healthy discussion about the text
every day. When it comes down to it,
students who come half the time and
do all the homework are still more
valuable to the class than students
who don't have time to do all the
homework because they are going
to every class and trying to have a
healthy sleep schedule.
Those students who attend class
are the ones who are the most suc-
cessful, and they know it. Rarely do
students ace a class they never went
to. You might pull a B if you're lucky,
but it's not always an easy feat.
Your health
should come
before class.
Fundamentally, the incentive to go
to class exists regardless of an atten-
dance policy. It's not fair to students
to mandate attendance. Sometimes,
students get sick and just can't get
themselves to UHS, or they don't
want to get others sick and want to
give themselves a chance to get bet-
ter by resting.
Attendance policies are nonsense.
If you go, you absorb the material. If
you don't, you don't. Your loss. Some-
times, it's just the lesser of two evils.
Better that than to be sick during
finals.

JAKE FROMMI
Talk policy, not pot

I care about drug policy. IScare about the way
society deals with drugs, the laws surrounding
drug use and distribution and the prison sen-
tences handed down to drug dealers and drug
users. From the sound of it, I care a whole lot
aboutdrug policy. Butthat's rarely the response
I get from most people when I bring up drug
policy in conversation. The usual response is,
"Look at this guy, he just wants to make weed
legal so he can get high whenever he wants. Just
another knee-jerk collegiate pothead." Laugh it
up all you want, naysayers, but you couldn't be
farther from the truth.
For those of you who don't know, Ann Arbor
decriminalized marijuana in 1972. This means
that anyone caught with pot today "shall be
fined $25.00 for the first offense, $50.00 for the
second offense, $100.00 for the third or subse-
quent offense and no incarceration, probation,
nor any other punitive or rehabilitative mea-
sure shall be imposed," according to the Char-
ter for the city of Ann Arbor. This ordinance
means that any "knee-jerk collegiate pothead"
has little to worry about when it comes to rec-
reational marijuana use. So tell me, naysayers,
why then doI care so much about drug policy?
America's drug policies have broad societal
implications. Our War on Drugs is a war on
Americans, and this war is being waged dis-
proportionately against African Americans.
According to a Human Rights Watch study cited
on drugwarfacts.com, African Americans com-
prise one-third of all drug arrests. However, they
account for46 percent of felony drug convictions
in state courts. While 63 percent of white Ameri-
cans receive incarceration sentences for drug
convictions, 71 percent of blacks who are con-
victed for the same crimes serve time.
These numbers represent the incredibly
unbalanced proportion of black fathers who
are taken from their families and sent to prison
while white fathers are free to continue provid-
ing for their wives and children. These numbers
mean that black youths involved with drugs are
much more likely to be sent to prison than their
white peers who can continue going to school.
While those young white adults hang out with
their friends and classmates, their black peers
get to spend quality time with violent offenders

and cellmates.
Americans lament the bloodyviolence occur-
ring in many parts of Mexico and fear that the
fighting could cross over into America. God
forbid Mexico's problems become our prob-
lems. How have we become blind to the fact
that drug cartels are fighting for domination
not over their own people, but over the trade
of drugs coming into America on a daily basis?
And while we're being blissfully ignorant, let's
also ignore the fact that according to a Dec. 14
article on msnbc.com, "U.S. firearms agents
estimate that around 80 percent of the weapons
used by Mexican drug traffickers come from
the United States." Mexicans are killing each
other at an alarming rate with American weap-
ons so that they can sell drugs to American
customers. Sure, we can beef up border secu-
rity and work with Mexican police to mitigate
cross-border violence. Or we could end a war
on drugs that is responsible for what amounts
to a civil war currently raging in our neighbor
nation to the south.
When I respond to naysayers with facts like
these, they begin to understand that I don't
simply care about drug policy because I'm look-
ing for a safer way to get high. When I explain
how our drug policies contribute to many of our
social, political and economic problems both
domestically and internationally, it's pretty dif-
ficult for those naysayers to continue with their
condescending criticisms.
As students, it's our responsibility to educate
ourselves about the problems facing this coun-
try so that we can go on to solve them. Whether
you care about drug policy like me or you have a
different area of interest, engaging in one edu-
cated conversation at a time can make a world
of difference. Understand the problems facing
America, not just those facing yourself, and
you'll be able to show any patronizing critic
that you're not just a "knee-jerk collegiate pot-
head" or a "naive pseudo-activist supporting an
issue-du-jour." Instead, they'll thank you for
being an informed advocate with the potential
to improve America.

more information about and support for the available
and free open-format software. Some universities, like
George Mason University have active education pro-
grams to fill this gap. Very good progress has been made
here in understanding and supporting open-access to
information, and HathiTrust is leading the way here.
But more progress is needed with open-format soft-
ware - progress in which the coding is known, and no
one owns it or limits access or use. This applies not only to
programs but to file formats, which can quickly become
inaccessible as the access programs are discontinued.
Microsoft is the antithesis of open. Our work and infor-
mation at the University should be in portable file formats
that are easily accessible with a variety of programs run-
ningon a range of operating systems, not just a recent ver-
sion of Microsoft Office/Windows. Easy cross-platform
access already applies for most image files such as tif and
.jpg, but not for other work files, particularly text files.
Individuals and the University have huge investments in
our own work files and information. Access shouldn't be
limited by ephemeral programs and expensive tollgates.
A prime example of free open-format software that stu-
dents should know about is OpenOffice.org, commonly
known as OOo. OOo will do everything that most users of
office software need in word-processing and spreadsheets,
and it is better than Microsoft Office in some areas. Not
only is it free, but it readily supports open file formats such
as open data text (odt), which is an international-standard,
low-byte-volume, open-format text file. O0o is very intui-
tive and easy to use. It's available on the Internet and also
on University computing-site computers.
Another useful open program is Zotero, a free, open
bibliographic program, which is very useful for keeping
track of publications and for instant reference list con-
struction. Zotero is actually supported by the University.
If software vendors want to offer proprietary programs
with enhanced features to perform special functions to
justify the costs, more power to them. But that should not

interfere with simple, easy-to-use, open-formatprograms
and our portable, open work files.
Hopefully, in the future, the University will support
and offer student and faculty access to computers using
the open operating system Linux. Open software, espe-
cially Linux, tends to be lean in terms of byte volume and
thereby offers an antidote to the software bloat that slows
performance, demands ever more hardware capacity and
occupies too much storage space. Addressing this bloat
could result in huge savings for the University.
The University could also cutcosts by goingmore open,
and some aspects of open software development could
be shared with other universities. These collaborations
add up very quickly, and they provide great experience
for students. In the end, the users would own and, most
importantly, control the software they depend on. Some
great opportunities for collaboration with other institu-
tions have been ignored in the past due to great cost and
inconvenience.
From many years of experience, I believe it's important
to have an agile, innovative, on-site IT staff to bring in
new technologies and adapt them to local needs. These
staffing costs could be covered by cost savings from going
to more open software and some shifting-and retraining
of IT staff as previous needs diminish.
As part of preparing students for the "real world" out
there where information access and software are likely
to be less accessible and more costly, more needs to be
done to make students aware of open-access and open-
format software. Students also need to be aware of why
open-access and open-format are so important for infor-
mation access. This would give students a graduation
gift of a portable legacy of useful experience. Informa-
tion is one of the cores of the University's business. We
could do much better in facilitating information access
and flow here for the University community and public
benefit.

TV REVIEW
. orpo comes to Power

Ann Arbor welcomes
Brazilian dance troupe
Grupo Corpo
By ERIN STEELE
DailyArts Writer
Watching modern Brazilian dance
company Grupo Corpo is like drink-
ing a cold Diet Coke on a hot summer
afternoon - rejuvenating, enlivening
and joyous. Arriving
in Ann Arbor for the Grpo Corpo
first time since 2002,
Grupo Corpo will bring Tonight and
its fizzy refreshment tomorrow
to the University as it at8 p.m.
performs at the Power PowerCenter
Center this Friday and
Saturday. Ticketsfrom$18
Grupo Corpo was
founded in 1975 by artistic director
Paulo Pederneiras and has since dazzled.
the international dance scene with its
innovative choreography. The group
performs in more than 80 shows each
year, in countries including Lebanon,
Japan, Mexico and Israel. The compa-
ny's Portuguese name is translated into
English as "Body Group," reflecting its
mission to use the body as an instrument
in creating vibrant modern dance with

strong Brazilian roots.
Michael Kondziolka, the University
Musical Society's director of program-
ming, worked.to include Grupo Corpo in
the 2011 artistic season. He described the
choreography as "extraordinarily athlet-
ic and high-energy" with an emphasis on
precision and clarity.
"(The performance is) really focused
very much on the bodies and the chore-
ography," Kondziolka said. "A lot of the
time it will be just pure dance onstage."
Grupo Corpo's style of dance consists
mainly of modern choreography with
balletic influences, as well as hints of
samba and Afro-Brazilian movement..
This weekend, the company will per-
form "Parabelo" and "Ima," both choreo-
graphed by Paulo Pederneiras's brother
Rodrigo. "Parabelo" has been described
by Rodrigo as his "most Brazilian" work
and features brightly colored costumes
and regional movement. "Ima" explores
interdependence in human relationships
through a series of solos, duos and group
dances of various sizes - creating a con-
stant fluctuation between many and few
bodies on the stage.
Due to the company's popularity and
packed touring schedule, Kondziolka
said he has had to work for two or three
years to secure performance dates. For
him and others at UMS, though, the wait
was worth it.

"People who really love to go see dance
should not miss this," he said. "The audi-
ence just loves them. We're talking about
some of the best dancers you've ever
seen."
Kondziolka is also quick to point out
that even those who are less familiar
with dance will appreciate the compa-
ny's dynamic performance, especially
since the art form has become more
accessible in recent years due to popu-
lar television shows like "So You Think
You Can Dance" and "Dancing with the
Stars."
"I reallythink that people should give it
a try," Kondziolka said. "Going to the the-
ater to see a company like Grupo Corpo is
a wonderful next step in someone's per-
sonal development as a lover of dance."
What makes the company most
appealing to such a wide audience is its
openness to interpretation.
"There's a wonderful ambiguity about
dance. (It's) almost like a Rorschach test,
you see in it whatyour mind suggests you
see in it," Kondziolka said. "I think that
there are as many possible takeaways as
there are viewers."
Those who attend the performances
at the Power Center will be among the
countless people worldwide who have
taken Grupo Corpo's Rorschach test
and found their own personal message
through the dancing and choreography.

the trust in his own relationship with
Beth, just as it creates a silent tension
in Ronny's approach to his partnership
with Nick - but none of them combine
to really take the characters far enough
into their individual conflicts.
Aside from the fact that most of its
humor is forced, "The Dilemma" feels
just a little too incomplete - and with
a 111-minute runtime, it just seems
like inefficient storytelling. The movie
doesn't round out its characters or give
them legitimate enough arcs to pass

And perhaps, at least for the film's
famous director, that's a good thing.
Howard blends in as a somewhat novice
comedic director and won't be remem-

FOX's new animated series is undeni-
ably weird, and not just because FOX let
someone who isn't Seth MacFarlane get a
show. With humor that
manages to be simul-
taneously disgusting
and intellectual, "Bob's Bo's Burgers
Burgers" seems ripped
straight from Cartoon PilOt
Network's Adult Swim Sundaysat8:30 p.m.
lineup - an odd choice FOX
for primetime on a net-
work between titans like
"The Simpsons" and "Family Guy."
--In }the-.pilot's opening scene, father
and restauranteur Bob (H. Jon Benja-
min, "Archer") tells his son Gene (Eugene
Mirman, "Flight of the Conchords") that
"There's a line between entertaining and
annoying,"to which Gene replies, "No, that's
a myth" and subsequently blasts laser and
fart noises from his megaphone. Here, Gene
may as well be speaking on behalf of the
whole show. While the humor sometimes
hits the mark with an unexpected clever
joke, the show's awkward and uncomfort-
able aesthetic proves more annoying than
entertaining.
H. Jon Benjamin's comedic timing and
distinct voice are just as compelling here
as they are in "Archer," and it's nice to
hear him voicing a more grounded charac-
ter. He's responsible for most of the show's
legitimately funny moments through his
deadpan delivery, and he benefits from hav-
ing the fewest gross-out jokes among the
cast. Bob's humor lies in pointing out just
how absurd everyone around him is, which
is welcome, given how unfunny the absur-
dity itself tends to be.
The other standout actor is Kristen Schaal
("Flight of the Conchords"), who voices
Bob's youngest daughter Louise. Louise is
an exceedingly well written character - her
childhood innocence shows itself with bru-
tal honesty, lack of foresight and no speech
filter whatsoever, but she still manages to
be adorable. Schaal brings young, mindless
exuberance to life, making viewers root for
Louise even when she causes an angry mob

to storm the burger joint.
Oldest daughter Tina (Dan Mintz,
"Important Things with Demetri Martin")
is the real problem character. She spends
the pilot complaining of crotch itch, and
later is mocked for having what appears to
be some rather serious mental problems.
While Tina's lines sometimes set up a decent
joke from Bob or Louise, they never work on
their own, even when they're clearly sup-
posed to.
The other problem is the uncompelling
narrative. Consider "Family Guy" - the
stories in that show often take crazy and
unexpected turns several times each epi-
sode. Not everyone finds the ludicrous sto-
ries tobe funny, but everyone can agree the
show is unpredictable. Then there's "Bob's
Burgers." The plot of the premiere focuses
on cannibalism - an off-the-wall theme
with the potential to spawn a crazy, unpre-
dictable and inherently funny story. But
Cannibalism is
naturally hilarious,
but 'Bob's Burgers'
can't make it work.
instead, the narrative is just boring, and
events unfold exactly as expected. It's not
enough for a comedy to have funny jokes -
the story itself has to be funny. Much like
Tina, the plot serves as a set-up for some
mediocre lines that don't compensate for
how much the plot wasted a potentially
great idea.
Even so, "Bob's Burgers" is certainly not
without merit. With its simplistic animation
style and perverse, dry humor, it's refresh-
ingly different from the other primetime
animated comedies out there. The series is
trying to juggle wit, shock value and crazy
narratives, but only the first of those three
is working out just yet. If it starts firing on
all cylinders any time soon, it deserves a
spot on FOX over anything MacFarlane can
throw at it.

Seeking vinyl vindication in a post-CD world

By DAVID RIVA
Daily Arts Writer
In Dec. 2008, I interviewed Ben Folds
after he played a show at the Michigan
Theater. During our discussion, Folds edu-
cated me on the resurgence of vinyl records
and cited specifics like better sound quality
and the perception that CDs are worthless
data discs as reasons for the return to an
older medium for music listeners.
At the time, I refused to believe him. I
was one of the few holdouts of the opin-
ion that, despite the sharp decline in sales
of compact discs in recent years, people
should continue to buy CDs even if the pur-
chasing volume became significantly less
than what it once was. I've always been
attracted to the physical nature of CDs,
and I didn't want to give up the experience
of holding something in my hands while
listening to an album for the first time.
Obviously, I was a bit naive and tried
to resist the natural progression of tech-
nology. After all, throughout the history
of recorded music, the focus has always
been on making smaller and more com-

pact devices to hold and play music.
From the substantial gramophone record
placed on a mammoth phonograph, to cas-
sette inserts for the handheld Walkman,..
to the virtual disappearance of physical
evidence for the existence of a song in the
form of the MP3, this has always been
the case. Regardless of my best efforts to
ignore the writing on the wall, I knew I
would eventually have to face the reality
that CDs will soon be extinct.
I'm normally riot a sentimental guy
when it comes to material possessions.
But when it comes to music, I'm as nostal-
gic as an old lady at a high school reunion.
My relationship with CDs stretches way
back to my discovery of music and genesis
as a passionate music listener. I'll never
forget the first time I popped one of my
brother's Weezer CDs into my portable
and was completely transformed by the
opening shenanigans of "El Scorcho" or
the brutal sincerity of "Butterfly."
Certain CDs also trace my phases of
growth through different genres and
styles that have transformed me into an
intolerable music snob. The day I bought

The Hold Steady's Boys and Girls In Amer-
ica on a whim because I liked the cover art
will undoubtedly go down as the greatest
impulse purchase of my life. Ultimately,
CDs have served to define me as a person
more than the clothes that I wear, places
I've traveled or schools I've attended.
Plastic jewel cases, 10-page lyric books
and scratch-prone pieces of polycarbon-
ate plastic have played a vitally important
role in my adolescent and college years,
and it's going to be tough to say goodbye.
From records to
cassette tapes to
CDs to MP3s to.."
records.
But it's not all gray skies and watery
eyes for me. With vinyl making a come-
back, I realized that my transition to 33

1/3-RPM plays was eminent. It was only a
matter of time until I would buy my first-
ever turntable, nearly a half century after
its invention. Luckily, my brother was a
step ahead of me and wrapped one up with
my name on it to put under the Christmas
tree. Upon opening it, I surprised myself
with my excited reaction to the gift. It was
like all those memories that my CD collec-
tion held didn't really matter anymore.
As it turns out, vinyl works as a pretty
easy transition from my bygone CD days,
and satisfies most of the things I have come
to love about CDs. For example, at the risk
of sounding like a materialistic prick with
morality issues and too much disposable
income, I think it's important for an artist
to make a profit on his or her creative out-
put. In this department, a vinyl record is
nearly identical to a compact disc. I've also
found it more rewardingto pick and choose
what I listen to and use the money I've
earnedto buy somethingthatwill entertain
.ne, instead of downloading anything that
looks or sounds remotely interesting.
Additionally, when I listen to music on
the Internet, I'm constantly in a judgmen-

tal mentality. I want to dislike every note
and every word coming out of my atro-
cious MacBook speakers. I'll look for every
flaw imaginable, including uninteresting
melodies, simplistic instrumentation and
contrived lyrics. But when I make a finan-
cial commitment to a physical piece of art
that a group of people poured in hours and
hours of time to put together, I want it to
be the best album I've ever heard. I'll look
for all of its redeeming qualities, focusing
on the high points while dismissing the
low points. Vinyl, almost more so than a
CD, allows for me to have this optimistic
outlook on the music I'm listening to.
While my parents were preparing din-
ner, I set up my new toy in the kitchen and
grabbed some old records that I'd recently
acquired while cleaning out my grandma's
house. As Sonny and Cher sang "I Got You
Babe," my sentimentality kicked in again
as I realized how fortunate I was to have
my family together during the holidays.
And so it began - a new era of memory-
making, rather than a departure from my
CD schmaltziness. It's simply a continua-
tion, but this time with a larger disc.

or hipsters. Either ways, it's easy
to see that the creators of com-
edy "Portlandia" have an inti-
mate knowledge of this lifestyle,
or they wouldn't have such a fun
time lampooning it.
"Portlandia" centers c spund,
unsurprisingly, Portland. The
city is a hub of sorts for this cul-
ture, described in the opening
minutes as a place where people
still talk about saving the planet
and dream of starting their own
bands, and where "all the hot
girls wear glasses." The show is
basically comprised into a series
of vignettes of off-the-wall situ-
ations, exaggerating the alterna-
tive lifestyle for comedic effect.

In one of the sketches, a couple
orders a chicken in a restaurant
and proceeds to ask the waitress
an inordinate amount of questions
about how the chicken was raised.
"Did it have a lot of friends?"
one of them asks the waitress.
The couple then becomes so
invested in how the chicken was
raised, they tell the waitress to
save their seats as they go to visit
the farm where it was raised to
see if it really is as organic as the
waitress claims.
Another scene has the same
couple running a "Women and
Women First Bookstore." They
find it very inconsiderate and
offensive that a man would use the
bathroom without buying some-
thing, while they, as clerks, are
inconsiderate too by being prissy
and condescending. The woman
at the register gets offended at the
man offering a $20 bill for a small
item, saying, "What do you think
I work for, tips?" They also offer
the man who used the bathroom
to take a class on protest organiz-
ing instead of buying something,
which is pretty on-the-mark satire
of the alternative liberal mentality.
It's not all satire, though; some
of it's just absurd. When the cou-
ple gets to the farm to see how

organic it is, there happens to be
a charming Charles Manson-like
character running it, and things
naturally get a little bizarre from
there. The whole show is just kind
of goofy, with unrealistic scenar-
ios and random quirky quips that
are hit-or-miss in their humor.
Exaggeration becomes par for
the course in attempts for parody.
The caricatures are over-the-top
and the script is silly.
Laugh out loud
at the liberals.
"Portlandia" isn't especially
well acted or directed, but it
doesn't really seem like it's try-
ing to be. It's a small show with
a singular idea to poke fun at the
"alternative lifestyle," and it does
that well. Since it's a show with
multiple sketches, the jokes take
a while to develop - there's only
about six or seven major laugh-
out-loud moments in each epi-
sode. It's ridiculous and dumb,
but if you like parody, "Portland-
ia" isn't a bad way to spend 30
minutes.

"How you doin'?"
and-wife comedy writing duo,
with their sitcom "Lyman's Boys"
winning its fourth BAFTA. When
American television mogul Merc
(John Pankow, "Mad About You")
proposes a U.S. version, Sean and
Beverly agree. They're met with
a slew of drastic changes, despite
the fact that everyone insists
they love the show. In fact, Merc
may not have even seen "Lyman's
Boys," despite claiming he loves
the series so much he wants to

have sex with it. The biggest cul-
ture shock for Sean and Beverly
is the studio's desire to cast Matt
LeBlanc in the lead role as the
headmaster of a boy's boarding
school.

For PNT, this is 'War'

By DANIEL CARLIN
Daily Arts Writer
"Here she is, boys! Here she is,
world! Here's Rose!" In the musi-
cal "Gypsy," stage mother Rose
pushes her
daughters into The War
show business Since Eve
even though
she is the one Through Feb.13
who wants to at various times
become the
star. In the Per- Performance
formance Net- NetworkTheatre
work Theatre's Ticketsfrom$15
world premiere
of "The War Since Eve," which
began previews Jan. 13, the tables
have turned and the mother is the
star, leaving her children to either
cater to her whims or flee.
This fictional comedy is set on
the evening that activist Roxie
Firestone receives the Presiden-
tial Medal of Freedom in recog-
nition of her work in the feminist
movement. Although Roxie has
broken down boundaries for
women, her personal life with her
grown-up daughters would not
exactly place her in the running
for best mother. Her youngest
daughter has been estranged for
the past 22 years, while the elder
one has devoted her life to Roxie
- acting as secretary and com-
panion to her mother.
Henrietta Hemelin, who plays
Roxie in PNT's production,
believes her character is so oblivi-
ous to her daughter to the point
that it is "unconscionable." How-
ever, Hemelin understands that

Roxie has a "control freak" ten-
dency, which drives her youngest
daughter away from her.
"I, in my personal life, have
fallen into patterns of commu-
nicating where I don't even real-
ize what it sounds like," Hemelin
said in a phone interview with the
Daily. "Here I hear what she says
and I look at it and say 'Aha!' She's
totally oblivious to the effect it's
having (on other people)."
Hemelin has been with "The
War Since Eve" since its original
readings as one of the featured
plays in the Fireside Festival of
New Works, one of PNT's many
programs. As a local theater com-
pany, PNT is fully committed to
promoting new plays and works
of homegrown playwrights.
Kim Carney, the show's writ-
er, is no stranger to PNT, as this
will be her fourth show with the
company. While Ann Arbor audi-
ences might recall Carney's past
shows "Moonglow" and "The
Home Team" at PNT, she has
also debuted three shows at the
Purple Rose Theatre Company in
Chelsea. In Carney's latest com-
edy, "The War Since Eve," she
looks to find the humor in a com-
plex relationship.
"I had heard an article in the
paper a couple of years (ago)
about Rosa Parks and her difficult
relationship that she had with her
children," Carney said. "It got me
thinking what it must be like to
have a national icon as your moth-
er and what a weird thing that it
would be. I didn't think I could
write a play about civil rights, so

I thought of the women's move-
ment."
Bringing Carney's play to life
is lighting designer Mary Cole,
who serves as the resident light-
ing designer for the University's
Department of Dance. She said
working with PNT promotes
more experiential opportunities
because it functions on a much
smaller scale than University
Productions.
Director David Wolber, who
also serves as the production's
artistic director, is excited about
this new comedy.
Ann Arbor hosts
play's world
premiere.
"I love that (the play has) three
strongwomen roles,"Wolber said,
adding that this is an uncommon
feat in the world of comedy.
"I think that the play connotes
not only the women's struggle fore
equality, but also - or more so
- the war between mothers and
daughters since the beginning of
time," Carney said.
Unlike "Gypsy," Roxie was not
the one found in "scrapbooks
full of (her) in the background,'
but her children were instead.
"The War Since Eve" presents 4
somewhat inverted story to the
musical, placing motherhood and
sisterhood on the battlefield.

very fact that Abramoff managed
to pull off such a massive conspira-
cy from offices minutes away from
the FBI's Washington headquar-
ters is funny, in a shocking, "oh
no he didn't" sort of way. Instead
of tastefully blending these two
genres, a la Soderbergh's "The
Informant," Hickenlooper crams
them together like sardines. One
minute, Abramoff and Scanlon
are joking about their massive
purchases and manipulating con-
gressmen into hilariously inept
statements on CSPAN. The next,
Scanlon is crying his eyes out in
a bathroom stall while Abramoff
rushes to comfort his sobbing wife
and vulnerable, fearful children.
It's a broken roller coaster, shifting
from emotion to emotion in a man-
ner that feels forced, manipulative
and artificial.
Nevertheless, "Casino Jack" is
salvaged by Spacey's dedication..
His character may work out every
day, but Spacey delivers an on-
screen thespian workout, present-
ing a perfectly timed performance
that cuts through the unfocused
nature of the script to deliver side-
splitting scenes that almost man-
age to seem genuine. As an added
treat, the movie includes the real
Abraioff's penchant for celebrity
impressions, allowing us to bask
in Spacey's uncanny imitations of.
Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Al
Pacino. It's some of this star's most
entertaining and impressive work
since his Oscar win for "American
Beauty." It's too bad that it had to
come in such an indifferent movie.

band's first LP, By the Hedge, con- ing such details might be considered

declassd.
The album is a slick, sexy study
in undone minimalism, often refer-
encing early Cure or Joy Division.
Track titles like "Bruises," "Cem-
etery Rain" and "Funeral Song"
contribute to the pervasive sense
of dreariness that seeps throughout
By the Hedge. Thus unsurprisingly,
the photo for the album's single
"Funeral Song" displays a close-up
of a forlorn androgynous young boy
sporting heavy eyeliner, a new wave
haircut and severely pouty lips - a
clear nod to By the Hedge's influ-
ences.
Goths Gone
Wild: Best of
Brooklyn.
But after a point, listeners might
grow weary of all the gloom and
doom. In "Ophelia" - atrack named
for the tragic heroine in Shake-
speare's "Hamlet," who drowns
herself in a river in the name of
unrequited love - the vocalist sings:
"Wherever you will go / Darkness
always follows." It is all fine and
true in context, of course, but some-
times a little juxtaposition might be
nice. Occasionally good things do
happen in the world, after all.
But the glass-half-empty mantra
remains unwaveringly persistent.
"Funeral Song," a pop-orientated
album standout, heralds the end of
summer with its strangely catchy
refrain: "So long, summertime /
Not coming back here." However,
the album's tone walks a fine line
between goth and suicidal.
The self-indulgent, morbid vibe
of By the Hedge detracts from the
cohesive sound, but somehow, it's
that very quality that makes much
of the album weirdly irresistible.

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Magazine Editor
It didn't surprise me when
Oprah Winfrey announced she
was starting her own network. In
seventh grade, I was convinced
that Oprah was the only person
who could stage a coup to take over
the American government, deem
herself Queen Dictator of Oprah-
land and get away with it by giv-
ing everyone her favorite things.
To some degree, this doesn't seem
entirely out of the realm of possi-
bility.
"Futurama" has likened Oprah
to a god, a simile national media
outlets love. Her followers are
Oprahites, they practice Opra-
hism and study the Word of
Oprah. The Wall Street Journal
coined the term "Oprahfication"
to describe her talk-show form
of therapy. It seems like anything
this woman touches turns to gold,
so the Oprah Winfrey Network
(OWN) shouldn't be much dif-
ferent. However, as more details
about the network and its pro-
gramming were revealed, I began
to grow skeptical.
On January 1, all the people who
regularly watched the Discovery
Health channel faced a forced con-
version to Oprahism. Discovery
Health is that channel that played
on the TVs in the doctor's office
waiting room. No one watched it
and therefore no one upgraded
their cable or satellite package to
see it. If anyone wants to watch
OWN, they'll now have to pay up
to get access to it.
But she's Oprah; she doesn't
need channel surfers. She has a
lineup of shows hosted by her dis-
ciples. Longtime BFF Gayle King
is breaking into the talkshow busi-
ness with "The Gayle King Show."
Other talk shows include "Dr.
Phil," "Inthe Bedroom with Laura

might be a turn-off for general
audiences.
While the show certainly has
potential and it's worth stick-

shouldn't rely on poking fun at

"30 Rock" succeeded because

Wolverines hold

The Michigan men's basketball
team may be rebuilding this sea-
son, but there's no squad in the
Big Ten that has
reconstructed its Minneota
starting lineup as
much as No. 15 at Michigan
Minnesota. Matchup:
OftheGophers' No. 15 Min-
five expected nesota 14-4;
starters, just Michigan 11-8
two have started When: Sat-
all 18 games for urday 7 P.M.
Minnesota (3-3 Where:
Big Ten, 14-4 Crisler Arena
overall) this sea- .d
son. In fact, nine TNRadio:
of the Gophers B
have started at
least once this season. Conversely,
the Wolverines' five starters have
remained constant since day one.
First, Minnesota coach Tubby
Smith sat junior Devoe Joseph for
the first six games of the season as
a punishment for violation of team

rules. Just eight games and four
starts later, Joseph transferred.
Senior guard Al Nolen sat out
five games with a foot injury while
redshirt junior Trevor Mbakwe
sat out two starts after violating a
restraining order. The forward is
awaiting his court date on Feb. 7,
and he faces up to 90 days in jail.
But even with the shift in start-
ing lineups, Minnesota has had its
fair share of success in conference
play. Last Thursday, the Gophers
upset No. 14 Purdue, 69-59, at Wil-
liams Arena.
And now Minnesota hits the
road tomorrow to face a Michigan
squad that's in the midst of a five-
game losingskid.
, The Wolverines (1-5, 11-8) are
coming off a tough road loss to
Northwestern where Michigan
allowed junior John Shurna to put
up 24 points - 22 in the first half
alone - off 8-of-14 shooting from
the field.
"Everyone's frustrated, it's
tough," junior Stu Douglass said
after the Northwestern game. "You

can talk all day about the (tough)
games you've had, the tough stretch
the last nines days, whatever. But
we haven't been winning and we
haven't been performing the way
we can and the way we should, so
it's not the best of moods."
But the schedule doesn't get any
easier with Minnesota. Michigan
can expect the same kind of hot
shooting and experienced play out
of Gopher senior Blake Hoffarber,
who shoots nearly 40 percent from
behind the arc.
And when the Wolverines aren't
focused on Minnesota's outside
shooting, Mbakwe will be a hand-
ful in the post.
Mbakwe has been touted as one
of the league's toughest big men
and averages 13.2 points and 10.4
rebounds per game.
In the teams' last four meetings,
Michigan has come away with all
four wins and three of Minnesota's
four losses this season have come
on the road. But if Michigan hopes
to steal this win on its tough Big
Ten schedule, will have to be run-

ning on all cylinders in order
to prepare for a very talented
Gopher team.
"We're treating every game
like a must win," junior Zack
Novak said Tuesday. "With the
way the league is right now, as
tough as it is, you need to get
every win you can."
With the loss at Northwest-
ern, Michigan capped a rigor
ously tight schedule where the
Wolverines played four games in
a span of nine days, which means
each game only allowed for one
day of preparation each.
But by Saturday, Michigan
will have had three days to
prepare for Minnesota, which
could prove to be imperative for
a young Wolverine team that's
been struggling to stick to its
game plan during game time.
"Hopefully this will give us
some time to regroup and refo-
cus," Novak said Tuesday. "Then
Saturday (against Minnesota)
we can come back and have a
better shot."

The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team might not focus on
records or streaks, but there are a
few statistics that can't be ignored
anymore.
The Wolverines (4-3 Big Ten,
11-7 overall) are 11-2 when they
score
at least MICHIGAN 75
60 NORTHWESTERN 67
points
in a game. And they did it again in
their 75-67 win over Northwestern'
on Thursday.
Senior guard Veronica Hicks
led the Wolverines with 16 points
and 14 rebounds after starting the
game off strong - she snagged two
rebounds and tallied five points
within the first three minutes of
play en route to her second consec-
utive double-double.
"(Hicks) played pretty well,"
Michigan coach KevinBorseth said
after the game. "She played well on
both sides of the ball, rebounding
well.We had arebound on the weak
side and alotofthose rebounds are
credit to her."
The energy provided by Hicks
gave Michigan the advantage it
needed to get ahead from the start
and hold the lead for the entire
game. But the Wildcats (3-4 Big
Ten, 14-6 overall) weren't an easy
opponent to tame, twice coming
back from behind to bring the con-
test within reach.
"(Hicks) is from Chicago and
she's never beaten Northwestern
(in Evanston) before," Borseth
said. "But she inspires the other
kids, especially in practice. Yester-
day she was guarding everybody
very hard and that kind of fuels
their fire."
According to Borseth, the key to
holding the lead was not throwing
the ball away. The Wolverines had
only nine turnovers all night and
tallied 16 points off Wildcat turn-
overs. Northwestern pulled within
seven points with just over three
minutes left in the first half after

trailing by as many as 14 points. But
sophomore guards Jenny Ryan and
Kate Thompson hit jumpers late
in the half to push the Wolverines
ahead.
Michigan gained its momen-
tum off Thompson's shot, which
she hit as the buzzer sounded. And
the Wolverines never looked back
- leading by double-digits for the
majority of the second half. But
even with the Wolverines shoot-
ing just under 50 percent and snag-
ging 30 rebounds, the Wildcatshad
another comeback. They went on
an 8-0 run with just over two min-
utes left in the game - cutting the
score to single digits for the first
time since the first half.
"Thompson had a three at the
end of the first half - that was one
way to fend (Northwestern off),"
Borseth said. "The other was that
we got a couple of hits and made
from free throws at the other end
late in the game. We just didn't
throw the ball away."
The Wildcats were on fire from
behind the 3-point arc, burying
shot after shot in ordercto stay alive.
And with 30 seconds left on the
clock, it was down to a two-posses-
sion game - the closestithad been
since the scoreboard read 14-9.
But the Wolverines kept North-
western at bay by sinking free
throws down the stretch. Sopho-
more forward Rachel Sheffer
sealed the deal with a layup in the
final 16 seconds of the game. Shef-
fer was another hot offensive play-
er for Michigan, tallying 14 points
in just 26 minutes of play.
Though the Wildcats won the
battle on the boards, 42-30, it was
a successful showing by the Wol-
verines. For the most part, Michi-
gan kept Northwestern off the
glass during the first half, limiting
the Wildcats to just five offensive
rebounds. The Wolverines also
held All-American candidate Amy
Jaescke scoreless and only gave her
one rebound all night.
"Any win in the Big Ten is a big
win," Borseth said. "And on the
road it's even bigger."

'M' opens against
four top-15 teams

Coming off nine-goal weekend,
Michigan battles Alaska at home

ByMAX HEILBRUNN
For theDaily
Most top-tier coaches prefer
to start their seasons with easier
competition to build momentum
during the early stages of the
season.
Someone forgot to tell Michi-
gan water polo coach Matt
Anderson.
When asked about the incon-
ceivable onslaught of games
this weekend, Anderson seemed
excited, to say the least. The
Wolverines will take their No.
8 ranking and splash into their
season this Saturday with games
against No. 15 Cal State North-
ridge, No. 7 San Jose State, No. 4
UCLA and No. 1 Stanford.
It is understandable to be a
little nervous playing such elite
opponents so early in the sea-
son, but Anderson is very much
looking forward to the oppor-
tunity for his team to be tested.
The early season kinks that may
worry some are an opportunity
for success to Anderson. In his
eyes, practice can only do so
much.
"I know that there aresome
areas we need to work on",
Anderson said Wednesday.
But until we play teams that
are better than us they won't be
exposed. Practice can lull you
into thinking you've covered
everything, but then you play a
team better than you are they
show you what you need to work
on."
Luckily for Anderson, three of
Michigan's first four games pit
his team against higher-ranked
opponents.
This season, the Wolverines
are equipped with a bevy of tal-
ented players, including a senior
class led by Alison Mantel and
Lauren Orth, who are on pace
to graduate with the most wins
in Michigan water polo history.
Last season the duo combined
for 103 goals and 88 assists.
Combine those two with
a star-studded young team,
including sophomore Kiki Gold-
en and the Wolverines' chances
looks bright. Last season, Gold-
en played in every game, while

scoring 39 times, tossing out
29 assists and grabbing 78
steals. All of this gives Ander-
son some breathing room and
helps ease the pressure of
playing such good competi-
tion this weekend.
"We'll be fine," Anderson
said. "This is what we do.
Every year we play whomever,
whenever, wherever and it
doesn't matter if its our first
three games of the year. We're
No. 8 in the nation. We'll take
a loss or two, but we will
have some victories and we
will look to get better. If you
look at our schedule, there
isn't anybody we fear and we
believe that we can play with
anybody."
"If you look
at our sched-
ule, there isn't
anybody we
The game of the weekend
will be the matchup against
Stanford, who has received
the most praise of any of
Michigan's opponents. Rather
than fearing the talented Car-
dinal, Anderson views it as a
credit to how far his Michigan
program has come.
"If they (Stanford) didn't
think it was going to be a
good game, they wouldn't
have flown out here to play
us," Anderson said. "That is
fortunately the respect that
we have earned. Teams don't
have to fly out here if they
don't wani to, but they are
choosing to do so. Stanford is
hands down the best team in
the nation, and we are going
to use that game to see how
we do.
"Hopefully we will have a
chance to play them again in
May when we host the final
eight for the NCAA champi-
onships."

The No. 6 Michigan hockey
team has only been shutout once
this season.
It happened back in Novem-
ber, but the team that managed to
blank the Wol-
verines' potent
offense is back AlaSka at
to take a second Michigan
crack at them.

shutout 3-0 in
the first game.
But when the Nanooks and Wol-
verines suit up to play on Friday,
both teams will be riding their
recent successes right into the
confines of Yost Ice Arena.
The Wolverines outscored
opponents 13-3 during their cur-
rent three-game win streak and
look to continue their recent
offensive outburst against Alaska,
who split last weekend's series
with conference leader No. 8
Notre Dame.
Sitting in 5th place in the
CCHA, Alaska beat the Fighting
Irish 4-1 last Saturday in South
Bend, snapping Notre Dame's four-
game win streak.
The Nanooks scored twice in the
first period and twice in the third
period on Saturday and head into
this weekend's matchup with their
offense red-hot.
"I think Notre Dame got sur-
prised at how good Alaska was in
both games," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said Wednesday. "Now
(Notre Dame) squeaked out the
game on Friday, but supposedly
Alaska was pretty much the better
team all weekend. That's a pretty
good statement, when you go in and
outplay and outshoot a first place
team in their building. That's what
we're up against."
While the Nanook offense
showed its flair in South Bend, Alas-
ka's biggest strength has been is its
defense this season. Currently, the

Junior forward Luke Glendening skates in a game last Friday against Ferris State at Yost Ice Arena.

Nanooks boast the nation's fifth-
ranked defense and only give up an
average of 2.14 goals per game.
The Alaska defense has been
stingy, thanks in large part to
junior netminder Scott Greenham.
A major cornerstone of Alaska's
success this season, Greenham has
played in 22 games for the Nanooks
and boasts a .926 save percentage
with a 10-8-4 record.
"This team isgoingtobetoughto
score on," Berenson said. "Goals are
goingto be precious onboth ends. If
you look at the stats ... if you look at
special teams, they're pretty much
identical to us.
"Goals against, they're pretty
much the same. We might have a
little edge on the goals for, 5-on-5,
but that's it."
But if there ever is agood time for

the Wolverines to take on a top-5
defense, it's when their own offense
is coming off a nine-goal weekend
sweep.
After falling behind 2-0 on Fri-
day in a home-and-home matchup
with Ferris State, the Wolverines
rallied in front of the Yost crowd
and scored three second-period
goals to overtake the Bulldogs, 3-2.
They carried Friday's offensive
momentum into the road game in
Big Rapids and scored six goals to
secure the sweep,6-1.
"You want to be careful about
over-confidence," Berenson said.
"But on the other hand, you want
to encourage the momentum. I'm
telling our team, 'We've got to keep
getting better. We can't be happy
with what we did Friday night.'
Maybe we got better Saturday, but

...you just don't do that.
"There's a mindset, it's the whole
team. It's not just the coach or one
player, it's the whole team. I want
us to get out of our comfort zone.
Where we're not as comfortable,
we've got to get better."
But Michigan is taking it one
step at a time this weekend. After
garnering its first sweep since Nov.
20 against Lake Superior State, the
Wolverines are counting on their
offense to help stifle the Nanooks
and repaythe favorfrom Fairbanks.
"I think we need to focus on the
little things again, because that's
what we did against Ferris," junior
forward Luke Glendening said. "It
started in the defensive zone.
"We didn't let up too many goals
and that translated into offense,
which was good for us."
