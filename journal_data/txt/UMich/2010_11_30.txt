May says U'
ftndraisingto
help students
afford tuition

At SACUA meeting,
Hanlon also talks
'self-help' financial
aid programs
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Jerry May, the University's vice
president for development, spoke
about how his office is working to
raise money to help students deal
with the burden of rising tuition
at a meeting of the leading faculty
governing body yesterday.
Addressing a question from
Gina Poe, vice-chair of the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs, May said that though
his office has not been pressured
to pay any of the University's
operating costs, development offi-
cials have been working with the
administration to prevent addi-
tional increases in tuition.
"We've been cognizant of the
need to try to figure out how to
reduce the pressure on raising
tuition," May said.
May added that his office is
trying to do this through raising
more money for need-based schol-
arships. May also said that with
every tuition increase, develop-

ment officials raise more scholar-
ship money to offset the financial
burden for some students.
Speaking about donor contri-
butions to scholarships, May said
donors often want to support stu-
dents hailing from their hometown
or country, which often leads to
some students being overlooked in
the scholarship process.
Associate Prof. of Architecture
Mojtaba Navvab, who is also a
SACUA member, expressed con-
cern that international students
aren't receiving as much scholar-
ship money as native students and
therefore do not have the same
opportunities in the workplace.
May said there is a gap of at least
$11,000 in aid between native stu-
dents and international students.
However, May also noted in his
talk that his office recently created
a scholarship fund to help support
students studying abroad and to
fund international students admit-
ted to the University.
Ed Rothman, SACUA chair and
professor of statistics, also raised
a question about how to garner
more money from faculty for an
undergraduate scholarship offered
to one student that is supported
almost entirely through faculty
contributions.
May said that though faculty

Columbia University Prof. Jeffrey Sachs discusses climate change and sustainable development at Rackham Auditorium yesterday.
UN advi sor to A2 crowd:Politics

In talk at Rackham,
Jeffrey Sachs says
media, lawmakers
ignoring issue
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
When Professor Jeffrey Sachs
of Columbia University's Earth
Institute introduced himself to a
crowd of about one thousand Uni-
versity community members in
a dimmed Rackham Auditorium

last night, he immediately let the
audience know where his loyal-
ties lie.
"I'm a Michigander through
and through," he said.
Sachs, who is the special advi-
sor to United Nations Secretary
General Ban Ki-Moon and the
president and co-founder of the
Millennium Promise Alliance. He
addressed the issue of global cli-
mate change during his talk yes-
terday, and called the debate over
global warming "unintelligible
and unimaginable" to the scien-
tists who study the topic.
He was invited to the Univer-

sity by the Gerald R. Ford School
of Public Policy in collaboration
with the International Policy
Center to give the 2010 Citigroup
Foundation Lecture. The Citi-
group Foundation established the
lecture series in 2000 as part of an
endowment to the Ford School.
Susan Collins, dean of the
Ford School, told the crowd that
Sachs's ability "to infuse theo-
retical insight with practical
engagement" made him an ideal
candidate to deliver the lecture.
Sachs began his speech by dis-
cussing the lack of coverage that
sustainability and conferences

dealing with climate change
issues receive in the media.
"How puzzling it is that as
important as this issue is, the
only time really its got notice in
the United States in the recent
months is to defeat (policymak-
ers) who voted for doing some-
thing about it," he said.
Sachs went on to explain that
while elected officials can under-
mine environmental issues when
it benefits them, the damage to
the planet is real and ongoing.
"The climate does not really
care about our politics, it's not

Experts: No relief in sight for
climbing rate of student debt

Level of debt for
students is worst its
been in 15 years
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
Student debt is at its worstlevel
in nearly 15 years and financial
experts agree that in the future,
students won't be in a better posi-

tion to payoff loans and cover col-
lege costs than those facing them
currently.
The $23,000 that the average
college graduate owes in loans
is a product of state legislatures
cutting higher education fund-
ing and universities increasing
tuition, according to Christine
Lindstrom, director of the Higher
Education Project for the Public
Interest Research Group. And
Lindstrom says students' aver-

age debt is actually higher than
reported.
"There's more debt out there
because more and more students
are relying on private student
loans, but that data isn't collected
in any way so we don't know,"
Lindstrom said. "I wish I could
say it's the current economic situ-
ation, but this is a problem that
we've been seeing over the last10
to 15 years."

Meram enlists Ultras to find lost jersey

New leadership plans
to promote section
collaboration in 2011
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Daily editorial
staff recently elected a team of 14
new editors to manage the paper
for the 2011 calendar year.

Every year, writers, editors,
photographers and designers vote
in a staff-wide election to choose
the paper's editor-in-chief and
editorial page editor. Each section
holds a similar election to choose
its managing editor. In addition,
the paper's senior editors appoint
some editorial positions, including
the managing editor, the Daily's
second in command.
After an election that lasted for
several hours, LSA junior Stepha-

nie Steinberg was elected editor in
chief last month. Steinberg - who
is currently a senior news editor -
is the Daily's first female editor-in-
chief since 2000.
"I'm honored to be in this posi-
tion," she said. "I really hope I
can set an example for all the
future women reporters who walk
through the Daily."
Steinberg said that though she
has a number of plans to improve

Jersey disappeared
while forward was
'crowd surfing'
after win over UCF
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
As time expired on the Michi-
gan soccer team's 2-1 overtime
victory over University of Central
Florida in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament on Nov. 21,
the players and the student sec-
tion converged on the sideline in
jubilant celebration.
Senior forward Justin Meram,

who scored the tying goal in the
second half of the game, took off
his shirt to celebrate the dramatic
come-from-behind victory. But
in the heat of the moment, Meram
lost his white number nine jersey
and he's calling on the Michigan
Ultras - the exuberant fan group
that's been a fixture on the side-
lines at all the men's soccer home
games this season - to help him
track it down.
LSA freshman and Ultras
Vice President Nate Hoff said
in an interview that Meram lost
his jersey while "crowd surf-
ing."
"After the game (Meram) was
waving (his jersey) around, and
then he stopped and just had it

in his hand. He ended up crowd
surfing, almost," Hoff said. "At
that point I'm pretty sure he just
had it in his hand and I guess it
got dropped or someone grabbed
it."
Meram wrote on the Ultra's
Facebook wall Monday morning
to notify the group of his missing
jersey.
"ULTRAS. PLEASE START
THE SEARCH FOR MY JERSEY
:) I KINDA NEED IT," Meram
wrote.
After Meram's Facebook post,
Hoff sent out an e-mail to the
Ultras listserv and a Facebook
message to the members of the
Ultras group requesting the jer-

The other block 'M'myth

Of all the myths on campus,
there is one that is best known
among the. student body - that
a new student's failure to avoid
stepping on the iconic 'M' in the
Diag will lead to a failing grade
on his or her first blue book exam
at the University.
The legend has been told dur-
ing new student tours at the
University, and has led count-
less students to walk in a zig-
zag fashion through the Diag to
avoid stepping on the 'M.' How-
ever, some students have tossed
the myth aside and purposely
stepped on the brass letter donat-
ed by the University's Class of
1953.
But there's no way to confirm
-whether the myth carries any
validity.
Several students have stepped
on the 'M' and haven't failed their
first blue books, while other stu-

dents who have purposely avoid-
ed stepping on the 'M' have had
less than stellar starts to their
academic careers at the Univer-
sity.
But if the myth is true, then
students who step on the 'M' do
have a way to remedy the inevi-
table consequences by following
the second half of the myth.
According to the lore, a student
can reverse the curse and avoid
failing his or her first blue book
exam by running naked from the
'M' on the Diag to the pumas that
sit in front of the Ruthven Muse-
um of Natural History.
And while this feat maybe pos-
sible, the jaunt must be complet-
ed within the time it takes for the
carillon in the Burton Memorial
Bell Tower to strike midnight.
The problem with this remedy
is that while the carillon is played
at the start of each new hour dur-

ing the day, it sits silently at night
- not making any noise when the
clock strikes midnight.
Additionally, with the renova-
tion currently being done to the
carillon and the bell tower, the
clock doesn't even strike mid-
night. Since work began on the
upper levels of the bell tower, the
clock has been stuck at 6:30.
But the myth of stepping on
the 'M' is not the only legend that
surrounds the bronze figure.
In earlier years, it was said
that if a student stepped on the
'M' during their undergraduate
career he or she would lose their
virginity before graduating.
And in its infancy, the 'M' also
served as a boundary to divide
freshmen and sophomores, with
freshmen not being allowed to
enter the area of the stone that
surrounds the 'M.'

New editors say they want to utilize

the paper during the next year, she
hopes to deliver the product read-
ers have come to expect.
"I really want to continue to
uphold the same standard that the
Daily has practiced for the last 121
years," she said.
She added that some of her main
goals include expanding circula-
tion into downtown Ann Arbor
and using social networking out-
lets like Facebook, Twitter and
mobile applications to disseminate
news.
LSA junior Kyle Swanson, who
was appointed as the paper's man-
aging editor for next year, said that
while he has worked at the Daily
for four years, he is excited to be
part of the new team.
"I'm excited to be at the Daily
for another year," he said. "And
I'm excited to be able to work with
Stephanie, and all the other edi-
tors and staffers."
Newly-elected Managing News
Editor Nicole Aber, an LSA junior,
said she plans to further lever-
age new forms of technology to
revamp how readers receive their
campus news.
"We're going to really try and
'increase our use of multimedia
'next semester to make more visu-
ally interesting components to go
with stories," shesaid.
Similarly, all the new editors
said they had major plans to make
improvements within their sec-
tions, through organizational
changes and new training meth-
.ods.
Co-Managing Photo Editor
Jed Moch, an LSA junior, said
that along with his co-editor, Art
& Design sophomore Marissa
McClain, he plans to ensure all
'photographers have a strong grasp
of basic design elements, such as
Photoshop skills and use of artifi-
cial lighting.
"The cornerstone of our cam-
paign was staff expansion and
staff training," he said. "We want
to bridge the gap between people
on staff and editors, and bring
everyone up to a level where
they can feel comfortable editing

and taking on significant assign-
ments."
The newly-elected co-manag-
ing sports editors, LSA junior Nick
Spar and Engineering junior Tim
Rohan, said they hope to improve
efficiency between writers and
editors to make the most of every-
one's time.
"I think we have a really great
group of people on staff," Spar
said. "And I'm confident the sports
section will rise to new heights."
LSA junior Sharon Jacobs, the
newly-elected managing arts edi-
tor, said she hopes to increase
communication between writers
and editors in her section.
"I hope to preserve the integ-
rity of the writers' self expression
while holding Daily Arts to the
high standard of writing and con-
tent that we have upheld for the
last couple of years," she said.
Other editors mentioned their
plans to make their sections more
accessible and familiar, both to
student readers as well as to Daily
staff members.
LSA junior Carolyn Klarecki,
who was appointed to be the Mag-
azine editor for the coming year,
said she has plans to make The
Statement more available to Daily
writers in all sections.
"I want The Statement to be a
place where all the best writers
at the Daily can showcase their
work," she said. "And where peo-
ple at the Daily can explore topics
in-depth that they don't always get
to in other sections."
Co-Managing Editorial Page
Editors Emily Orley and Michelle
DeWitt, both LSA juniors, said
they hope to create an editorial
page that students are excited to
read every day.
"We're hoping to write edi-
torials that stir up some passion
around campus and are applicable
to students," Orley said.
Despite the varying goals of the
sections, Steinberg emphasized
the importance of collaboration
among the staff to create a stron-
ger paper overall.
"I hope to instill a new sense
of collaboration between the sec-
tions and more communication

between the editors," she said.
Section editors agreed, say-
ing stronger collaboration in the
future will be necessary to publish
the best possible paper.
Aber said she believes commu-
nication between the news section
and other areas of the paper will
help make the paper more unified
and integrated.
"We're going to try to expand
on working with the opinion sec-
tion, so that we're all on the same
page when news breaks or when
it comes to relevant news issues,"
she said.
Moch also said the photo sec-
tion hopes to send photographers
to the meetings of other sections,
such as news and design, in order
to make sure the lines of commu-
nication remain strong.
Despite the extra time and
effort required to enact their far-
reaching goals, many of the new
editors admitted they were anx-
ious for their terms to begin.
Aber said she was excited for the
new semester because she antici-
pated a lot of change with the elec-
tion of the new editing team.
"I'm just excited to see where
Stephanie takes the paper," she
said. "And I'm happy that I get to
be a part of it."
LSA juniors Zach Bergson and
Helen Lieblich were also elected
co-managing design editors by the
Daily's Design staff.
In addition, Engineering junior
Sarah Squire, currently a co-man-
aging design editor, will focus on
special web projects during her
second year on the paper's man-
agement team as the Daily's web
development manager.
Steinberg also said the coming
year seems to hold a lot of promise,
and that she is extremely excited
to take on her new position and to
begin working with the new staff.
"I think we're going to work
really well together as a team to put
out the best product that we can,"
she said. "And I anticipate that
we're going to have fun doing it."

Sea border in Korea
seen as a recipe for
accidental warfare
YEONPYEONG ISLAND,
South Korea (AP) - The view
from this South Korean island
takes in the undulating hills of
North Korea just seven miles
away and the seafood-rich waters
all around - a region of such eco-
nomic and strategic importance
to both countries that one expert
calls ita recipe for war.
Violence often erupts in this
slice of sea claimed by both coun-
tries. Boats routinely jostle for
position during crab-catching
season, and three deadly naval
clashes since 1999 have taken a
few dozen lives.
The South's president took
responsibility Monday for fail-
ing to protect his citizens from
a deadly North Korean artillery
barrage on Yeonpyeong Island on
Nov. 23. The originsofthe attack
can be traced to a sea border
drawn at the close of the Korean
War, nearly 60 years ago.
As the conflict ended in a truce,
the U.S.-led U.N. Command divid-

ed the Yellow Sea without Pyong-
yang's consent, cutting North
Korea off from rich fishing waters
and boxing in a crucial deep-
water port, a move that clearly
favored the South.
North Korea has bitterly con-
tested the line ever since, arguing
that it should run farther south.
But for Seoul, accepting such
a line would endanger fishing
around five South Korean islands
and hamper access to its port at
Incheon.
"It is the perfect recipe for
'accidental' warfare," Erich Wein-
gartner, editor-in-chief of Can-
Kor, a Canadian website focused
on North Korean analysis, wrote
recently.
"The navies of both sides pro-
tect their respective fishing ves-
sels. Mischief and miscalculation
does the rest," he added. "The out-
break of hostilities is less surpris-
ing to me than the fact that for 60
years these hostilities have been
contained."
The Nov. 23 attack hit civilian
areas in Yeonpyeong(pronounced
yuhn-pyuhng), marking a new
level of hostility along the con-
tested line. Two civilians and two
marines died, and many houses

were gutted in the shelling.
Normally home to about 1,300
civilian residents, the island was
declared a special security area
yesterday, which could pave the
way for a forced evacuation of
those who did not flee last week.
Military trucks carrying what
appeared to be multiple rocket
launchers were seen heading to a
marine base on the island.
Long-range artillery guns
and a half-dozen K-9 howitzers
were also on their way, the Yon-
hap news agency reported, citing
unidentified military officials.
South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak, in a nationally tele-
vised speech, vowed tough conse-
quences for any future aggression,
without offering specifics.
"I feel deeply responsible for
failing to protect my people's lives
and property," he said.
After his speech, Yeonpyeong
officials announced new live-
fire drills for Tuesday, warn-
ing residents to take shelter in
undergroundtbunkers. Another
announcement later in the eve-
ning said there would be no exer-
cise; marines on the island had
failed to get final approval from
higher authorities.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Some charities feel
burned by statewide
smoking ban
The organizers of some of Mich-
igan's charity gaming events say
they're feeling a financial pinch
because the state's smoking ban
is driving gamblers who are also
smokers away from bingo parlors
and charity card games.
Gaming is a big moneymaker
for Michigan's nonprofits, pouring
tens of millions of dollars into good
causes - from Little League teams
to marching bands to Lions Clubs -
and far outpacing traditional fund-
raising.
But the Detroit Free Press
reported Saturday that statewide
charity gaming revenue for the
third quarter of2010 was $45.5 mil-
lion, down about 25 percent from
the $61.8 million collected during
the same quarter in 2009, accord-
ing to figures from the Michigan
Lottery.
Some charity gaming organizers
blame the state's ban on smoking
in most public places, which took
effect May 1.
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
U.S. Supreme Court
to hear Calif. prison
crowding case
In a case pitting states rights
against the power of the federal
judiciary, the U.S. Supreme Court
will hear arguments about a feder-
al court order requiring California
to release inmates from its over-
crowded prisons.
At issue during today's hearing
is the medical and mental health
care delivered to inmates in the
nation's largest state prison sys-
tem.
Eighteen other states have
joined Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneg-
ger's administration in urging the
justices to reject the order as over-
reaching and arguing that it poses
a threat to public safety. Attorneys
general elsewhere fear they could
face similar legal challenges if the
decision survives.
A 2005 ruling by a federal judge
in San Francisco found that an
average of one inmate per week
was dying in California prisons as
a result of medical neglect or mal-
feasance.

classified State Department docu-

to contain fallout from unflattering
assessments of world leaders and
revelations about backstage U.S.
diplomacy.
The publication of the secret

fied widespread global alarm
about Iran's nuclear ambitions
and unveiled occasional U.S. pres-

Afghanistan, Pakistan and North

bluntly candid impressions from
both diplomats and other world
leaders about America's allies and

Isaly's Foreign Minister Fran-

Evidence of greater stress on
students' finances is everywhere.
Applications for financial aid at
the University have increased as
well as national demand for infor-
mation about financial aid.
According to Margaret Rodri-
guez, senior associate direc-
tor at the University's Office of
Financial Aid, the University has
responded by increasing need-
based financial aid by 11.7 per-
cent this year and introducing the
Economic Hardship grant, which
has provided $500 support for in-
state students whose families are
experiencing financial difficul-
ties.
Despite these adjustments to
compensate for the rising costs of
college, increases in tuition can
often be an obstacle in overcom-
ing financial debt.
Michael Boulus, executive
director of the Presidents Coun-
cil, State Universities of Michi-
gan, said higher tuition rates are
the direct result of significant
drops in state funding over. the
last several years. The state leg-
islature allocated $316 million to
the University this year, a 2.8-per-
cent decrease from last year. Bou-
lus said decreases in allocations
have pushed the University to
raise tuition to cover operational
costs.
This year, tuition rates
increased 3 percent for out-of-
state students and 1.5 percent for
in-state students. Though they
were the lowest tuition increases
since 1984, Boulus said the cost of
education is becoming too expen-
sive.
"We've lost our focus as a pub-
lic good. (Higher education is)
becoming more of a private good,"

Boulus said.
The increasing costs of college
have made financial aid a necessi-

anyone's arm" when it comes to
donations.
At the meeting, University
Provost Phil Hanlon continued
the discussion of the University's
efforts to help make the Univer-
sity more affordable for students,
compared to tuition rates at peer
institutions.
Looking at need-based finan-
cial aid, Hanlon said the Univer-
sity has been working to improve
"self-help" financial aid or loans
Sachs then offered a definition
of global sustainable development
and explained why it poses such a
challenge to policymakers.
"It is how to combine the eco-
nomic aspirations of the planet ...
with planetary sanity with respect
to the earth's ecosystems, the nat-
ural environment and the shared
biodiversityonthe planet," he said.
Sachs said he defines global sus-
tainable development as having
three broad objectives, "maintain-
ing growth, helping to rescue the
poor and helping to save the planet
from destruction."
He explained that the multi-
dimensional nature of the issue of
sustainable development is what
makes it so challenging for policy-
makers.
"We have a hard enough time
in our country achieving any one
goal, at least at this moment," he
said. "We're certainly not very
good at achieving multiple goals."
In addition, Sachs noted that
ty for students with unmet needs.
Those who do not receive suffi-
cient aid are forced to search for
other options to avoid debt.
"They're either opting out of
college completely or needing
to work now," Lindstrom said.
"While some work is a good idea,
too much has the opposite effect.
If you're working 30, even 40
hours (each week), you're actually
undermining (academic) perfor-
mance."
For students who cannot meet
universities' financial demands
with their available funds and
scholarship money, a recently
approved addition to federal stu-
dent loan options has improved
options for government aid. The
new income-based repayment
plan that became available last
year allows students to pay back
their loans based on their earn-
ings after graduation - instead
of a set amount per month for a
specified number of years.
Under most plans currently in
use, students repayctheir debtover
a period of 10 years. The income-
based payment plan often extends
the amount of time that students
are paying off existing loans but
protects them from defaulting on
their loan payment due to insuffi-
cient funds.
Lindstrom's Higher Education
Project advocates causes such as
the income-based repayment plan
to confront the growing need to
provide financial support to col-
lege students.
"We were able to take $40 bil-
lion away from banks and invest
it in more Pell Grant aid for stu-
dents," Lindstrom said. "Now we
need to pay attention to what we
can do to decrease the default rate
for recent college graduates."
New information about finan-
cial aid programs is always in
high demand, but as scholarships

and loans become more crucial to
students than ever before, web-
sites like finaid.org and fastweb.

and work-study options offered to
in-state students.
With this measure, Hanlon
said he feels the University has
reduced tuition costs of the in-
state students but could still offer
better financial aid options for the
rest of the students.
"I think that we would like to
do better, compared to some of our
peer competitors, particularly for
non-resident students and inter-
national students," Hanlon said.
the human population and indus-
try worldwide are growing at
alarming rates, which are placing
a strain on the environment.
"The boundary constraints are
not second order concerns, they
are not footnotes for complete-
ness," he said. "They are going
to be the essential questions for
humanity, even if Fox News and
The Wall Street Journal haven't
figured it out yet."
On this note, Sachs said that
the media's debate over whether
climate change is actually real is
irrational and a hindrance.
"To the climate.,scientists, this
debate about whether climate sci-
ence is real or not is so far from
reality in the science; it's the unin-
telligible and unimaginable to
them," he said.
"The science at the basic level is
not in doubt...what's in doubt is the
magnitude, the pacing, the timing
but not the basic science itself," he
continued.
com have expanded exponen-
tially, according to Michael Kan-
trowitz, the publisher of both
websites.
Kantrowitz said finaid.org
receives five million visitors each
year and fastweb.com has 50 mil-
lion registered users. He added
that the websites' free informa-
tion and planning tools satisfy a
new niche in today's market for
prospective college students, for
whom scholarship searches and
completion of the FAFSA are just
another part of the college pro-
cess.
LSA freshman Ainsley Losh
registered on fastweb.com to
find scholarships and said that
the website was beneficial to her
search process. She added that
the University didn't offer her any
financial aid packages when she
enrolled this year.
"Michigan offered me noth-
ing. I have a couple grants (and
the rest is) all savings that my
parents put away for me when
I was little," she said. "I have a
scholarship through Burger King
for a little bit of money. I looked
around a lot and applied for so
many scholarships, but that was
the only one I got."
For the University, Michigan's
state budget deficit will likely
continue to take precedence over
additional funding. Currently,
Michigan is one of four states that
allocates more money to correc-
tions than to higher education.
Despite the apparent lack of
scholarships and high demand
for financial aid, both Boulus and
Kantrowitz said they don'tcexpect
increases in funding to lower uni-
versity costs any time soon.
"Seven-eighths of students
who apply for financial aid gradu-
ate with debt," Kantrowitz said.
"For the past two decades, loans
have absorbed the increase in col-

lege costs, while grants haven't
really kept pace. It's going to get
worse over the next decade."

DailyNewsEditor
Toxicology Prof. Martin Phil-
bert, senior associate dean for
research in the School of Public
Health, has been named the dean
of the School of Public Health,
according to a press release
issued by the University yester-
day.
University Provost Philip
Hanlon said in the press release
that he's excited about Philbert's
promotion, which is still pend-
ing approval by the University's
Board of Regents.
"President Coleman and I are
very pleased that Dr. Philbert
is assuming this vital leader-
ship role in the School of Public
Health," Hanlon said in the press
release. "We are confident that
he will provide impressive lead-
ership for the School of Public
Health, strengthening an already
excellent school."
Philbert said in the press
release that he is excited to work
with faculty, staff and students in
the School of Public Health and
at the University as a whole to
further develop the field of pub-
lic health in Michigan and the
United States as well as around
the world.
"I look forward to working
with our talented and dedicated
faculty, staff, students and alum-
ni, with our collaborators across
campus, and with our external
stakeholders to find new and
innovative ways to bridge the

divide between scholarly discov-
ery and the widespread adoption
of the best public health practic-
es," he said in the press release.
Philbert will replace current
Dean Kenneth Warner, who is
stepping down from the position
in order to return to teaching
and research, according to a May
press release issued by the School
of Public Health.
Philbert received his bache-
lor's degree in biology and chem-
istry from the College of Arts and
Technology in Cambridge, Unit-
ed Kingdom in 1984, followed by
a Ph.D. in neurochemistry and
experimental neuropathology
from London University in 1987,
according to the press release.
Before coming to the Univer-
sity in 1995, Philbert worked as
an associate professor at Rutgers'
Neurotoxicology Laboratories,
the press release states.
Philbert began at the Univer-
sity as an assistant professor of
toxicology, and was promoted
over time to his current posi-
tion as senior associate dean for
research and professor of toxicol-
ogy.
Philbert's research projects
and interests include experi-
mental neuropathology and the
treatment of tumors of malignant
gliomas, according to the School
of Public Health website.
A number of deans at the Uni-
versity appointed in the last few
years have also been promoted
from jobs within the University,
including Medical School Dean
James Woolliscroft in 2007,
College of Engineering Dean
David Munson in 2006 and Col-
lege of Education Dean Deborah
Loewenberg Ball in 2005.
Philbert will officially take the
position on Jan. 1, 2011, according
to the press release.

"In the wild post-match cel-
ebration, someone wandered off
with Justin Meram's jersey (#9),"
Hoff wrote. "He really needs this
back."
"No one is going to be mad, Jus-
tin just wants the jersey back so he
can play," Hoff added, encourag-
ing anyone who had the jersey, or
anyone who knew about the shirt's
whereabouts, to contact an Ultras
executive officer.
Hoff said no one has yet to reply
to his e-mail or Facebook message
with any pertinent information
regarding the location of the miss-
ing jersey.
Athletic Department Sports
Information Director Jessica Poole
said she was not aware of the inci-
dent and declined to comment on
Meram's missing jersey when she

was contacted yesterday afternoon.
Players have two white jerseys -
a long-sleeved and a short-sleeved
- each valued at $70, according
to Hoff. Meram was sporting the
short-sleeved version in the game
against UCF.
Meram scored two goals in Sun-
day's game, when Michigan beat
South Carolina 3-1 in Columbia,
S.C. to advance to the Elite Eight
of the NCAA Tournament. The
Wolverines wore their blue kits on
Sunday, so the missing white jersey
wasn't an issue.
The No. 10 seed Wolverines
will face No. 3 seed Maryland on
Saturday in College Park, Md.
It's unknown whether Michigan
will wear blue or white uniforms
against the Terrapins.
If Michigan wins on Saturday,
the team will advance to the Col-
lege Cup - the final four of NCAA
soccer - that will take place on
Dec.10 and Dec.12 in SantaBarbra,
Calif.

In sync with students
Campus should use new online writing resource
f he Sweetland Writing Center has always been a useful
resource for students. But a new Sweetland service may
increase the number of students who know and love the
center. At the beginning of the semester, Sweetland expanded its
online services to allow for more personal interaction between stu-
dents and peer tutors through a new branch of its Online Writing
Lab - OWL - called SyncOWL. This useful resource will allow
students to receive help remotely, interactively and at their conve-
nience. Sweetland should continue to improve its online services.
At the same time, students should take advantage of the resources
offered to them.

The purpose of SyncOWL is to help stu-
dents receive peer tutoring on their writ-
ingvia web conferences. The program uses
Google Docs so students and tutors are
able to view the student's work at the same
time and communicate via text, audio or
video. SyncOWL incorporates an interac-
tive element into the online tutoring ses-
sion. In a Nov. 23 Daily article, Anne Gere,
director of the Sweetland Writing Center,
described SyncOWL as a part of a series of
efforts to integrate media and writing.
Sweetland helps students understand
assignments and develop their ideas coher-
ently in essays and other kinds of writing.
Peer tutors provide students another set of
eyes that can help students catch mistakes
or focus their ideas better. This can be
especially beneficial to younger students
who are nervous about approaching pro-
fessors and new to the demands of college-
level writing. The current OWL system
extended the low-stress interaction that
students got at the writing center to the
ease of the Internet.
But the OWL - as easy and useful as
:it is - didn't allow any personal interac-
tion between student and tutor. Respons-
es were limited to a list of comments and
notes on a PDF, which restricted the back-
and-forth that often makes tutoring most

valuable. SnycOWL will add that conver-
sation to the convenience that students get
with the OWL.
One of the greatest things about SyncO-
WL is that it's easy to use. Any University
student with a Google account - which
anyone can sign up for free of charge -
can get help editing an essay from the peer
tutors at Sweetland through SyncOWL.
And SyncOWL was cheap, too. The system
was easy to implement and doesn't require
upkeep from the University's IT Services
because it's run on Google Docs, which is
maintained by Google.
But SyncOWL shouldn't be a standalone
achievement. Rather, it should mark the
beginning of further additions that build
upon existing resources to help students
get assistance on individual assignments
and learn how to improve their writing over
time. Sweetland and other University pro-
grams should continue to make a variety of
online resources available to students.
SyncOWL is an efficient and cost-effec-
tive academic service that makes it pos-
sible for students to get help with their
writing wherever they have access to the
Internet. But unless students actually use
SyncOWL, it won't reach its full potential.
Students should log on to the site and take
advantage of the resource.

Teenage texting

When I returned home for Thanksgiving
break this year, I decided to work at a specialty
store that I had been employed at throughout
high school and during portions of the summer.
I figured with the holiday shopping season just
beginning, my former employer might need an
extra hand - even if it's only for two days.
As I started to ring up a costumer during one
of my shifts, I couldn't help but notice that she
was texting on her cell phone. Usually this action
wouldn't bother me, but I grew more frustrated
with the situation as the customer spent our
entire interaction texting. While I think texting
at a register is an incredibly rude gesture by itself,
the most startling aspect of this interaction was
that this costumer appeared to be roughly 14 or
15 years old. Maybe I'm having a memory lapse,
but I can't remember being as obsessed with tex-
ting when I was her age.
This encounter made me reflect on my
personal experience with texting and also
reminded me of a CNN article I read earlier
this semester that summarized a study on
cell phone usage as well as text message prac-
tices among different age groups. The October
2010 study by The Nielsen Company analyzed
roughly 60,000 individual cell phone bills
as well as survey results from 3,000 teens
throughout April, May and June. The results
noted that text messaging has been increasing
rapidly - specifically among teenagers. Indi-
viduals ages 13- to 17-years old are reported to
be sending or receiving approximately 3,339
text messages each month. Nielsen noted that
this is an 8-percent increase in the age group
from last year. Comparatively, Nielsen found
that 18- to 24-year-olds send or receive approx-
imately 1,630 texts per month.
If those findings weren't startling enough,
Nielsen also noted, "all of this texting activity
has come at the expense of voice." In Nielsen's
study and analysis, it found that "voice activ-
ity has decreased 14 percent among teens." The
study also discovered that there were many rea-
sons for the trend toward texting, including 22
percent of teens who find texting easier and 20
percent of teen respondents who found texting
to be faster than a traditional phone call. The
CNN article remarked that the findings from

this study imply that "texting is a more impor-
tant means of communication than ever."
While these numbers are certainly astound-
ing, my initial reaction was an overwhelming
feeling of fear. How is it possible for teenagers
to maintain relationships and build their inter-
personal skills if they are fixated on text mes-
sages? The findings from the Nielsen study left
me wondering whether teenagers might suffer
in the long run due to their apparent obses-
sion with texting. And based on this appalling
amount of text messages, I think it's possible
that there might be larger consequences for
teenagers. If teenagers are constantly voicing
their thoughts, feelings and opinions through,
text messages, aren't they losing, or failing to
strengthen, their abilities to communicate over
the telephone - or even worse, in face-to-face
situations? Though it may seem obvious, the
ability to communicate well over the telephone
is an important skill to have. With this increas-
ing reliance on texting, I fear teenagers may be
losing this ability.
There are also some concerns about spelling -
if students are always relying on abbreviations of
words, then does their traditional spelling deteri-
orate? That's an important skill, too, and a poten-
tial consequence that can't be ignored.
Of course, this is my opinion about the poten-
tial consequences oftexting, but this result seems
plausible. My reaction may be rash and extreme,
but I can't help but be worried about this becom-
ing a future dilemma.
Even though I am ina different age group and
grew up at a time when texting wasn't as preva-
lent, I know I'm no better than these teenagers.
I rely on texting as a form of communication,
too - but I didn't send and receive more than
3,000 texts when I was 13 years old. I don't know
if there is a solution to the growing trend of text
messaging among teenagers. I believe, based on
this evidence, that it may continue to grow in
the future. But I do think parents need to make
sure their children aren't failing to focus on their
verbal and interpersonal communication skills,
because not everything in their futures will be
communicated through T9 Word.

In a world of ever-increasing gov-
ernment secrecy and control, a grow-
ing market for transparency and
accountability has emerged. Nowhere
is this more visible than the release of
classified information by the whistle-
blowing organization WikiLeaks.
Since the beginning of the year, the
group has been releasing critical
information hidden from the Ameri-
can public. These documents contain
information ranging from cover-ups
of friendly fire casualties in Afghani-
stan to the U.S. government's failure
to investigate hundreds of reports of
torture and rape by Iraqi police and
soldiers.
The most recent disclosure by
WikiLeaks highlights the fears of
Israel and Saudi Arabia regarding
Iran's nuclear program. According to
leaked diplomatic cables, King Abdul-
lah of Saudi Arabia has urged the
U.S. to attack Iran to halt any further
advances of Iran's nuclear program.
Whether you support an attack on
Iran or are highly critical of military
cover-ups isn't the main issue here.
The fact is that this information is
significant, and concealing these
developments from civilians violates
the public interest of the world at
large. The disclosures I mentioned
above are a fraction of the cover-ups,
corruption, failed policies and wastes

of taxpayer money that WikiLeaks
has revealed to the world in recent
months. As Simon Jenkins of The
Guardian puts it, "if that's not in the
public's interest, I fail to see what is."
In anticipation of the organiza-
tion's expose, WikiLeaks maintained
high standards of professionalism
working closely with the Spanish
news outlet El Pais, Le Monde out of
France, Speigel out of Germany, The
Guardian out of Britain and The New
York Times - five of the world's top
media outlets.
The Guardian notes that meticu-
lous processes were carried out to
ensure that the leaks "could not be
party to putting the lives of individu-
als or sources at risk, nor reveal mate-
rial that might compromise ongoing
military operations or the location of
special forces." Governments across
the globe will probably condemn the
disclosures - buj they're wrong to
press for the prosecution of whistle-
blowers like WikiLeaks front man
Julian Assange.
WikiLeaks isn't alone in their self-
described mission to "open govern-
ments." Closer to home, Michigan
votes - a project sponsored by the
Mackinac Center for Public Policy -
has a similar mission. Through the
use of a searchable online database,
Michigan Votes grants users online
access to "concise, plain language and
objective descriptions of every single
bill, amendment, and vote that takes
place in the Michigan legislature."
An invaluable resource, Michi-
gan Votes allows citizens across the
state a previously unforeseen level
of accessibility to government infor-
mation. Before, explanations for the
dozens of votes and the allocation of
millions in taxpayer dollars that can
take place on a daily basis were dif-
ficult for the common person to find.
Today, a few clicks of a mouse can
give Michiganders the opportunity
to hold their public servants account-
able for their actions.
There is also University alum and
U.S. House Representative-elect Jus-

tin Amash, whose campaign I worked
for this summer. Currently a Michi-
gan state representative, Amash is
the first legislator in the country to
post every single vote that he makes
on Facebook for the entire world to
see in real-time. Dedicating himself
to enhancing government transpar-
ency, he provides a summary of each
bill and justification for his votes.
Besides holding himself account-
able as a public servant, Amash's
Facebook page is a crash course for
anyone interested in the extensive
and often frivolous spending of pub-
lic funds that occurs in Lansing.
Fortunately, the trend toward trans-
parency is a hit. Amash's Facebook
page had a couple thousand fans at
the beginning of the year. Today, it
features more than 15,200 followers
from around the country.

WikiLeaks reveals
what should be
public knowledge. *

My hope is that the trend toward
enhanced transparency continues.
As fellow Michigan Daily columnist
. Imran Syed noted in a recent piece,
"neither of the two groups that are
supposed to look out for the people
- government and the press - are
doing their jobs" (Judging Wayne
County, 11/22/2010). In an era when
the institutions that we are supposed
to trust have deteriorated, we should
welcome with open arms alterna-
tives to the traditional press - which
has failed to serve as a check on an
increasingly subversive government.
To the true journalists, transparen-
cy devotees and whistleblowers out
there, thank you.

The ine-art things in life

Please stop, think for a moment
and raise your hand if you've been
to a "fine arts" event since the
beginning of this semester. For
those who raised your hands (and
you're probably
being stared
at and judged
right now), how
many have you
been to? One?
Five? All of
them ever?
To answer
my own ques- LEAH
tion, yes, I can BURGIN
raise my hand
- I've been
to at least one fine arts event.
But, for someone who considers
herself interested in fine arts, I
feel like the quantity of events
I've attended is super low. To
date, I've been to two musicals
(The School of Music, Theatre
& Dance's "Into the Woods" and
MUSKET's "Aida") and an opera
(School of MT&D's "The Elixir
of Love"). I've also wandered
through the University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art several times.
But ... that's it.
While I've almost matched my
"event points" from last year dur-
ing the course of one semester,
I still feel guilty. The Univer-
sity brings us so many awesome
events (and student tickets are
so cheap!), that I feel like I'm
missing out when I choose not to
attend something. For example,
this past semester I had an inter-
est in attending the University
Musical Society-hosted outdoor
play "Susurrus" and seeing the
Japanese Sankai Juku dance
company. Both events would have
been unique and eye-opening
experiences. Now, they're just
opportunities missed.
But let's pretend I had made it
to these events. Yay for me! This
would only bring the number
of events I attended up to five
(excluding UMMA visits). Five
still seems pretty low though,
consideringI never attended a

gratuitousness, but wisely heeds
its restraints and results in a scene
that suggests gritty documentary

Boyle performs small miracles
onscreen to maintain a degree of
originality. Most of the camera
angles that hold our eyes inex-

* Soulja's missing soul

By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
For the Daily
Soulja Boy still exists. He still
records music, puts together
albums and releases them for pub-
lic consump-
tion. Whether **
this is a good
idea is an
entirely dif- S l
ferent matter. The Deandre Way
The Dean- Stacks on Deck
dre Way,
his newest
album, is scheduled to be released
Nov. 30. The album's concept?
"My way of thinking, my logic, my
theory on a lot of things," said the
20-year-old rapper told Hiphop-
stan.com. "It's basically my inter-
pretation on life ... my logic, my
theory on a lot of things."
For an album devoid of emo-
tional complexity, conjunctions
and, in many cases, multisyllabic
words, the thought of The Deandre
Way representing anyone's life is
frightening. In fact, it's difficult to
find a trace of logic in any one of
the album's 10 tracks.
With its opening song "First
Day of School," one might expect
touching recollections of child-
hood, reaching goals to be a rap
superstar or a raw account of
growing up in a rough side of town
- something even mildly person-
al. Instead, the track is a tribute to
the rapper's exceptional dressing
skills. That's right, a four-minute
description of his matching shirt,
hat and belt babbled obnoxiously
over a beat. Since the last half of
nearly every word in the chorus
is omitted, it's tricky to make out
what exactly the artist is saying.
But something along the lines
of "I dress every day like it's the
first day of school" can be picked
out. How's that for a peek into the
mind of an inexplicable rap sensa-
tion?
The rest of the album's con-
tent is equally laughable. Topics
include making and spending mil-
lions of dollars - an amount to
"go crazy over," dealing with the
"trippin' " and "flippin' " of other
people, sexy ladies and driving
around while playing absurdly
loud music.
At least "Fly" contains the per-
sonal touches promised by the

'Whomever shall I Superman next...'
rapper. On the track, he discusses few memorable traits. Its pres-

picion that Franco has a psychic
connection to Ralston making him
privy to his innermost emotions.
What an honor for the brave hiker
to endure such a grand ordeal and
have his unparalleled act of human
resilience reenacted by the most

capable actor for the role.
"127 Hours" doesn't question
the value of a life deprived of its
full faculties - it proves that value
threefold. The film stays true to his
indomitable spirit to its end; in a
final, inspirational scene, we learn
that Ralston enjoys mountaineer-

once a commemorative biography
and a pulse-pounding thriller, and
it's not for the weak of heart.

An exodus of
creativity to cable
has reshaped TV
By LINDSAY HURD
Daily Arts Writer
Dear Network TV,
Every year, people bitch and
moan about you consistently fail-
ing to come up with a solid lineup
of new and original shows. To
make matters worse, after this fall
season, you have actuallyrenewed
a majority of these crappy shows.
What's the deal, network TV?
What's with the lack of innovative
content?
Let's face it - the only thing
you know how to do is follow
trends in entertainment. Vam-
pires became popular, you fired
back with "Vampire Dairies."
Searching for the next biggest
talent becomes all the rage so
here comes "American Idol,"
"America's Got Talent" and many
more knockoffs. "Law & Order"
does well and you make 50 spin-
offs, including the latest clone
"Law & Order: LA." Retread-

ing is pretty much the game you
play nowadays, which just plain
sucks.
Maybe you feel jealous? You
used to get all the attention and
now cable and the Internet have
expanded into your turf. The
average viewer has more channels
and media outlets than ever. We
no longer care about the actual
channel our show is on, as long as
we can watch great content. The
old idea that your biggest value is
access for everyone is bull.
The fact is that at least 80 per-
cent of us Americans have more
than five stations at our disposal
and will go where the content is
best. Even your old friend Conan
O'Brien has left you for the green-
er pastures of TBS. You think he'll
be less successful on a smaller
network? Viewers love him and
his personality and will watch
him no matter what station he is
on.
To keep us, you need to create
content people find interesting.
But you seem to be leaving that
up to the cable market. Showtime,
AMC and HBO have such great
shows because of their casts, overt
adult themes, high-paid directors
and cinematic editing - but pri-

marily because the plotlines are
innovative, original and thought-
provoking.
Instead of spending money on
remakes of past shows, why not
try picking up pilots that make
viewers want to think? You don't
need Martin Scorsese or Oscar-
winning actresses; you just need
new ideas and good writing. In
fact, it should be your duty as the
one TV outlet that reaches all
Americans to give us stimulating
ideas that aren't just fat people
losing weight or celebrities trying
to reboot their careers by doing
the cha-cha.
Yes, we have come to expect a
higher quality writing, set design,
acting, etc. from our TV. But isn't
that good for the progression of
culture? For too long, you've been
getting by on what you know will
bring in the ratings and sticking
to that bare minimum. You have
casual viewers, not crazed fans.
These cable and satellite niche
markets are starting to take over
your precious audience. Every
time one of them comes up with
a brand-spanking-new idea for
a show, they take a little more of
your audience away. Think about
it - our generation grew up on

Saturday morning cartoons,
"Saved by the Bell" and "TGIF"
on the networks and learned to
schedule our lives around them.
Nowadays, kids watch channels
like Disney and you networks lit-
erally rerun the same shows on
your channels. To kids, you rep-
resent just another way to get the
same shows they could easily find
somewhere else. It's lazy.
Instead of being the great pro-
viders of cultural you once were,
you're now headed down the path
to mediocrity and boring repeti-
tion. The thrill of watching a set
of shows on any given night on
your channels will soon be lost if
you keep creating shit TV. You'll
lose your importance sooner than
you think. If the CW falls in the
forest but nobody was watching,
who cares?
This, network TV, is a plea for
you to work a little bit harder to
try and stay relevant. By copy-
ing old ideas over and over again,
you're pretty much telling us that
this is the way it's going to be from
now on. And we will leave, have
no doubt about that.
Sincerely,
Everyone

the 11 games and Michigan at
secured its first
ever title. This Clemson

Minnesota lost
to Virginia 87-79.
Tuesday night, the Wolverines
(3-2) face Clemson, a team fresh
off a Thanksgiving tournament
trip to the Virgin Islands where
it went 2-1, its only loss com-
ing against Old Dominion by one
point.
This year's Tigers (5-1) are
competing without coach Oli-
ver Purnell, who led Clemson to
three-straight NCAA Tourna-
ment appearances, and Trevor
Booker, who left for the NBA.
But Clemson brought in coach
Brad Brownell, and Booker's
younger brother, Devin. Devin
and Jerai Grant make up a post
tandem that has been quite suc-
cessful this year on the boards and
in the scorebooks. The post play is
complemented by balanced scor-
ing from guards Demontez Stitt
and Tanner Smith.
The teams have met three times
before, with Michigan leading the
series, 3-0. They last faced each
other in the first round of the 2009

Michigan coach John Beilein led the Wolverines to victory over Clemson in the
first round of the 2009 NCAA Tournament.

the matchups have been decided
by more than six points.
Michigan is hoping to keep
on pace with those results and
outperform this past weekend's
showing at the Legends Classic
by studying their offense more in
order to execute it better.
"Sometimes when you get in the
game you might forget some stuff
but the good teams never forget,"
sophomore Darius Morris said
after the Wolverines' loss to the
University of Texas El Paso on Sat-
urday. "We've just gotta be able to
execute ... One day we're gonna get
there, where we have a game plan
and we're gonna stick with it."
But it isn't just the Wolverines

worried about Michigan's offen-
sive sets.
"(Beilein's) an innovator,"
Brownell said in a video posted
online by the Clemson Athletic
Department. "His offense is some-
thing he kind of designed and has
tweaked through the years. It's
very difficult to play against, espe-
cially with a short prep."
Both teams look to improve on
their fates at last year's ACC/Big
Ten Challenge, where Michigan
lost to Boston College by four and
Clemson lost to Illinois by two.
Historically, the games have been
tight matches - last year, seven
of the 11 games were decided by
seven points or fewer.

College Hockey Showcase comes to an end

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
MINNEAPOLIS - The Michi-
gan hockey team had already
gone to its locker room in Mari-
ucci Arena after
a 3-1 loss to No. NOTEBOOK
15 Minnesota on
Sunday. But the Gophers stayed
on the ice. With Minnesota lined
up across the blue line, captain
Jay Barriball skated to the .scor-
ers' table and lifted the three-
tiered wooden trophy.
There was a smattering of
applause from the half-full
crowd when Barriball brought
the trophy to his teammates. In
a strange way, it was a fitting
end to the College Hockey Show-
case. Minnesota's win made it

2-0 in the 18th and final College
HockeyShowcase and gave it the
title, while bringing to an end
the imperfect tournament for the
perfect rivals.
The goal of the showcase was
to bring Big Ten rivals Michigan,
Michigan State, Wisconsin and
Minnesota together every year.
While the Showcase did this over
Thanksgiving weekend for nearly
two decades, the prime matchups
usually played out before half-full
crowds since many students were
on Thanksgiving break. Three
out of four schools wanted to con-
tinue the Wisconsin pulled out.
No. 8 Michigan ended the
tournament with a loss Sunday,
but it still holds the best record
among the four teams at 20-14-2
throughout the tournament his-

tory. Minnesota finished one win
behind the Wolverines. But this
tournament wasn't exactly about
winning the tournament to hoist
a trophy. It was about beating Big
Ten teams.
Michigan did neither Sunday
night.
"It hurts to lose, period,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said. "We like the competition,
we like the games against Big Ten
programs and it's disappointing
that we won't have as many."
MAKING SPARKS: After
being a healthy scratch for the
last nine games, sophomore for-
ward Lindsay Sparks found his
way into the lineup for Sunday's
night's game against Minnesota.
Sparks registered a shot in the
first period, but as the teams had

eight power play opportunities
between them in the final two
periods, his ice time diminished.
"I thought he had a good jump,"
senior forward Louie Caporusso,
his linemate, said. "You can't ask
much from him, he hasn't been
(in) the lineup for over a month.
He did all he can do. Unfortu-
nately, he came in at a bad time
where we didn't play great for
him."
Sparks, who hadn't played
since Oct. 23, saw a little faith
from Berenson as he was out on
the ice for a power play late in the
game, but he didn't do anything
to turn around an 0-for-4 perfor-
mance from the unit.
He played alongside Caporusso
and junior Luke Glendening, a
pair that had formerly been with

junior David Wohlberg, who was
moved to a new line as Ben Win-
nett came out of the lineup after
playing in Madison on Friday.
NOTES: Michigan's overtime
game with Wisconsin was its
fourth of the year. It played in
just two overtime games in the
past two years ... Former Michi-
gan hockey player Billy Jaffe
called Sunday's game for the Big
Ten Network. Jaffe played under
Berenson from 1987-1989. He will
also call Michigan's game next
weekend against Ohio State for
the Big Ten Network ... The Col-
lege Hockey Showcase usually
has a Friday-Saturday format, but
due to a Minnesota home foot-
ball game, the Wolverines were
forced to wait until Sunday to
play the Gophers.
