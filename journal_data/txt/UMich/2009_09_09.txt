Aenational debate seen from campus

Provost instructs
professors to be easy
on ill students
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
DailyStaffReporter
Getting sick is bad. Missing class
can be worse.
But this year, the University is
asking professors to be more flex-
ible with sick students who skip
class because of an illness, particu-
larly those who get the H1N1 virus.
Dr. Robert Winfield, the Univer-
sity's chief medical officer, said stu-
dents should not attend class if they
have H1NLso that they can't spread
the virus and infect faculty and fel-
low students.
"We're asking professors to be
lenient about this," Whifueld said,
adding that University Health Ser-
vice will not write notes for those
infectedwith H1N1because doctors
expect an overwhelming amount of
students may catch the virus.
"We're indicatingthe HealthSer-
vice can't give notes to everybody
because we'll be overwhelmed, and
we really need to take care of the
sick people," Winfield said.
Students who miss class because
they are ill are advised to e-mail
their professors and academic
adviser to notify them of their
absence.
Andrew Burchfield, manager of
emergency planning forthe Univer-
sity, said students have a personal
responsibility to take care of them-
selves and follow the University's
request to self-isolate when ill.
"People need to make sure that

they're heeding the advice of 'If
you're sick, stay home; Don't go in
and contaminate others because
that's the best way we're going to
stop the spread," Burchfield said.

'U' puts halt to 'Fan
Can' beer campaign

Before Obama's
speech to Congress,
U' faculty and
students weigh in
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
Daily StaffReporter
Tonight before a joint session of
Congress, President Barack Obama
will give one of the most highly
scrutinized speeches of his presi-
dency. In an effort to rally support
for his health care plan, the Presi-
dent is expected to clearly explain
what he wants in a health care
reform bill.
"People will leave that speech

knowing where he stands," White
House Press Secretary Robert
Gibbs said on ABC's "This Week."
Health care reform has drawn
considerable attention this sum-
mer, from raucous town hall meet-
ings to factually incorrect talk of
government "death panels."
Much of that attention has come
from politicians and the national
news media. Meanwhile, the views
of those in medical community
seem to fly under the radar.
. In interviews this week, mem-
bers of the University's Medical
School expressed concerns about
the changing landscape of health
care but remain optimistic about
the enhanced coverage.
Nat Schuster, a third-year medi-
cal student who has been closely
following developments on the

issue, said many of his peers are
awaiting the forthcoming legisla-
tive decisions before deciding to
pursue a career in primary care.
"I think generally within the
med school that people are watch-
ing excitedly about what could
happen over the next few months,"
Schuster said. "All the stars are
aligning right now for health care
reform."
Schuster welcomed the possibil-
ity of providing universal access to
health care, citing substantial need
in the United States.
In 2007, the U.S. Census Bureau
estimated that nearly 46 million
Americans were uninsured while
another 25 million were underin-
sured, accordingto the U.S. Census
Bureau.
Schuster, amember ofthe Health

Policy Society (POSO), a student
group in the Medical School that
convenes weekly to discuss issues
like health care reform, is con-
vinced that a massive overhaul in
the system is not necessary to pro-
vide access to health care.
"Health care in the United States
right now is a patchwork quilt of
public and private payers," he said,
"and that's notgoing to change."
Dr. Mark Fendrick, an associ-
ate professor in the School of Pub-
lic Health, echoed the sentiment,
saying, "incremental reform is the
reform that happens."
. Fendrick anticipates that any
policy detailing both access to
care and quality improvement will
unavoidably lead to an increase in
overall expenditures.

Officials say Bud
Light gimmick
encourages underage
drinking on campus
ByANNIE THOMAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Real men of (marketing) genius?
University officials don't think so.
In the lead-up to this year's col-
lege football season, Anheuser-
Busch, the venerable beer producer,
has rolled out "Fan Cans" targeted
at winning over pigskin fans on
campuses across the country. But
University officials, in a series of
letters to the company, threatened
legal action if the beer company
didn't stop using the school's colors
in the controversial campaign that
sells Bud Light in color-coordinat-
ed cans that mimic the team colors
of 27 colleges.
University Spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said University offi-
cials urged Anheuser-Busch to
stop the campaign because yellow
and blue beer cans could give the
impression that the University pro-

motes underage drinking.
"If our name was associated with
an alcoholic beverage, the natural
next step for people would be that
the University is endorsing alco-
hol," she said. "Our students are
mostly underage, and so it doesn't
make any sense."
The University's initial letter to
Anheuser-Busch cited the Michi-
gan licensing program, which offi-
cially licenses products to support
the University's educational and
athletic programs. The letter said
the program is "carefully crafted to
assure that any products licensed
support the University's values
and its standards for excellence,"
and that the licensing of University
trademarks on alcoholic beverages
would not meet those standards.
The decision to lobby against the
campaign contradicts the Universi-
ty's position on a similar underage
drinking matter raised lastyear.
After 129 college and university
presidents chose to sign the Ame-
thyst initiative - a petitionto lower
the national drinking age from 21 to
18 - last year, University President
Mary Sue Coleman opted not to.

THURSDAY: FRIDAY:
Before You Were Here Photos of the Week

The Human Powered Subma-
rine Team combines Scuba div-
ing, bike riding, engineering and
ateering in its quest to design,
build and race submarines on an
international level.
HPS has taken part intO0 inter-
national races to date, includ-
ing the International Submarine
Race in Bethesda, Md., and the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers Human Powered Sub-
marine Context in Escondido,
Calif.
In their last international
submarine race, the team set a
University of Michigan record of
SOS5 knots.
During a race, a Scuba diver
encloses him or herself in the
submarine's hull, which, once
submerged, fills with water. The
diver then pedals the submarine

like a bicycle while a group of
Scuba divers monitors the prog-
ress. The submarine with the
fastest time wins.
The' team's primary pilot,
Patrick Trabert, an Engineer-
ing sophomore, said the thrill of
speed in the submarine makes
the competitions exciting, but
that the ability to focus under-
water trumps all.
"The best part of competing-is
getting inside the submarine and
being in a completely quiet envi-
ronment," he said.
Project Manager Stephen Cur-
tin, an Engineering sophomore,
said the team hopes that a new
hull it plans to build this year
will help them break the school
record again and to beat rival
Texas A&M at the 2011 ISR.
"We're trying to get it most-

ly built so we can test it and be
great when the competition rolls
around," he said.
Members of HPS say they ben-
efit greatly from their involve-
ment with this intellectually and
creatively stimulating endeavor.
"I joined the team because it
was a small team and it provided
a unique challenge to be design-
ing for something underwater,"
Curtis said. "It pushes you to be
creative and challenge yourself a
little."
Curtis said that the club offers
its members many benefits,
especially in the field of marine
engineering. Pour former team
members are now employed by
the Maryland naval base where
submarine races are held, he
said.

NEWS BRIEFS
East Lansing, Mich.
Granholm outlines
plans for balancing
Mich. budget
Gov. Jennifer Granholm said
yesterday she wants to balance the
upcoming budget by cutting about
half the $1.2 billion Senate Repub-
licans have suggested while rais-
ing about $550 million in expanded
taxes and fees.
Many of the ideas had been men-
tioned previously but yesterday was
the first time the Democratic gover-
nor issued a written copy of her pro-
posal. She said her plan has been on
the table since Aug. 6 and includes
phasing out an unpopular business
tax surcharge over three years. The
Republican-controlled Senate fin-
ished passing its own budget-balanc-
ing plan in June.
But Democrats who control the
House still are discussing how they
want to tackle a $1.8 billion shortfall
in the state general fund and a $900
million gap in the school aid fund in
the budget year that starts Oct. 1.
Granholm said no one wants a
repeat of the 2007 state government
shutdown. She spoke with reporters
afterthe grand openingof a new IBM
center at Michigan State University.
Washington D.C.
Dem leader wants
'successful' plan
for Afghanistan
The Obama administration faced
growing skepticism from Congress
yesterday over the prospect of more
U.S. troops in Afghanistan as White
House officials intensified an inter-
nal debate over any new buildup.
Back from a month in their home
districts, House and Senate lawmak-
erssaid theywanted tosee strongevi-
dence from the administration and
military officials that ordering thou-
sands more troops to the war-torn
nation would dislodge insurgents
from safe havens in Afghanistan and
neighboring Pakistan.
"We'll want to see a plan, a plan
that members conclude can be suc-
cessful," House Majority Leader
Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters.
Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate
Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee,said it's far from
clear that the U.S. military mission
in Afghanistan can succeed, "despite
the enormous bravery of our troops
and talent of military leaders."
Rochester, Mich.
Oakland U. asks
judge to order
profs back to work
Oakland University has asked a
judge to order striking professors
back to work as classes remain can-
celed at the suburban Detroit univer-
sity.
A hearing was scheduled for 10
a.m. EDT today before Oakland
County Circuit Judge Edward Sos-
nick on the university's complaint
that the strike is illegal.

The campus chapter of the Ameri-
can Association of University Pro-
fessors authorized a walkout Sept.
2 after the university proposed a
three-year wage freeze along with
cuts in health-insurance benefits.
The Detroit News and Detroit
Free Press report progress has been
made in talks but negotiations broke
off early yesterday without an agree-
ment.
About 18,000 students attend the
public four-year school in Rochester.
Tehran, Iran
Iran raids raise
pressure on top
opposition leaders
Iranian security forces yesterday
cracked down on the opposition's
campaign to highlight torture and
abuse of prisoners in the country's
postelection crisis, shutting down
offices of pro-reform leaders and
arresting five of their aides in a
startling series of raids.
The raids hiked up the pressure
against the top opposition leaders,
Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi
Karroubi, who hard-line clerics
and commanders of the powerful
Revolutionary Guards have said
should also be arrested.
The arrests suggested that
authorities aim to crush the cam-
paign led by Mousavi and Karroubi
to bring to light alleged torture
and rapes of protesters who were
detained in the heavy crackdown
against the opposition that fol-
lowed the disputed June presiden-
tial election.

Fines proposed for not
buying health insurance

Sen. Baucus says he
can no longer
support public option
WASHINGTON (AP) - Ameri-
cans would be fined up to $3,800
for failing to buy health insur-
ance under a plan that circulated
in Congress yesterday as divisions
among Democrats undercut Presi-
dent Barack Obama's effort to
regain traction on his health care
overhaul.
As Obama talked strategy with
Democratic leaders at the White
House, the one idea that most
appeals to his party's liberal base
lost ground in Congress. Pros-
pects for a government-run plan
to compete with private insur-
ers sank as a leading moderate
Democrat, Sen. Max Baucus of
Montana, said he could no longer
support the idea.
The fast-moving developments
put Obama in a box. As a candi-
date, he opposed fines to force
individuals to buy health insur-
ance, and he supported setting up
a public insurance plan.Yesterday,
fellow Democrats publicly begged
to differ on both ideas.
Democratic congressional lead-
ers put on a bold front as they left
the White House after their meet-
ing with the president.
"We're re-energized; we're
ready to do health care reform,"
said Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid of Nevada.

House SpeakertNancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., insisted the public plan
is still politically viable. "I believe
thatapublicoptionwillbeessential
to our passing a bill in the House of
Representatives," she said.
After a month of contentious
forums, Americans were seeking
specifics from the president in his
speech to a joint session of Con-
gress tonight. So were his fellow
Democrats, divided on how best
to solve the problem ofthe nation's
nearly 50 million uninsured.
The latest proposal: a ten-year,
$900-billion bipartisan compro-
mise that Baucus, who heads the
influential Finance Committee,
was trying to broker. It would
guarantee coverage for nearly all
Americans, regardless of medical
problems.
But the Baucus plan also
includes the fines that Obama has
rejected. In what appeared to be
a sign of tension, White House
spokesman Robert Gibbs point-
edly noted that the administration
had not received a copy ofthe plan
before it leaked to lobbyists and
news media yesterday.
The Baucus plan would require
insurers to take all applicants,
regardless of age or health. But
smokers could be charged higher
premiums.And60-year-oldscould
be charged five times as much for
a policy as 20-year-olds.
Baucus said Tuesday he's try-
ing to get agreement from a small
group of bipartisan negotiators
in advance of Obama's speech.

Guarding the Great Lakes
New regulations will protect state's ecosystem and economy
ver the next few weeks, Michigan residents will flock to the
Great Lakes to get in some end-of-summer beach fun. Not
only does Michigan's most precious resource provide state
residents with local vacation spots, but the Great Lakes are also
vital to many of the state's most important industries like tourism
and fishing. But because the state is so reliant on its lakes, it's also
necessary to protect them from environmental hazards like inva-
sive species. To combat this problem, the U.S. Coast Guard recent-
ly proposed regulations that would lower the amount of invasive
species introduced to the lakes by sea-faring cargo ships that dock
in them. Congress should put these regulations into effect to safe-
guard a resource that Michigan cares about and needs to protect.


It's a sad state of affairs that many in this country
politically would rather start an 'Animal House'
food fight rather than inspire kids to stay in school'
- White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, commeting on the seeming apathy and lack of
commitment to helping fund the nation's education system, as reported yesterday by CNN.

Many types of invasive species are intro-
duced into the lakes by way of ocean-faring
ships' ballast water, which is the water
used to help ships maintain the appropriate
weight and balance as they load and unload
cargo. This water is picked up and dumped
wherever necessary, and all kinds of organ-
isms - from algae to fish - travel with that
water to unfamiliar environments. Cur-
rently, regulations on ballast water are few
and far between, though there have been
recent movements to make regulations
more rigorous. The Coast Guard's pro-
posal will place stricter regulations on the
amount of organisms a ships' ballast water
can contain before being dumped.
The ecosystem operates on a delicate bal-
ance, and foreign species can easily disturb
that balance. The Great Lakes are still suf-
fering from the introduction of the zebra
mussel, a striped mussel originally native
to Eastern Europe. Some native animals
like ducks can eat the zebra mussel, but
that hasn't stopped it from spreading rap-
idly across the region and forcing out native
species.
While the shipping industry is certain-
ly important to Michigan's economy, the
Great Lakes need stricter regulations on
incoming freighters to keep them safe. The
lakes will not keep attracting visitors if
their ecosystem continues to sustain such
damages. The Coast Guard's proposals are

simply a practical way to bridge the needs
of the shipping industry with the well-be-
ing of Michigan waters.
Approving these regulations is Congress's
responsibility. Though many states benefit
from being able to use the Great Lakes for
shipping, Michigan and its neighbors alone
are suffering the environmental conse-
quences. Better protection for the lakes is a
sensible way to make this situation fairer to
the Great Lakes states.
On top of the need to protect the envi-
ronment, approving these regulations will
actually be a money-saving move, too.
Repairing the damage done by invasive
species is an expensive endeavor - for the
Great Lakes alone, it has cost more than
$200 million a year, according to an Aug.
28 article by the Associated Press entitled
"Coast Guard proposes water ballast rules."
The benefits to the environment notwith-
standing, these regulations will save the
state and federal governments plenty of
cash in the long run.
The proposal is currently undergoing
a comment period, which will last until
November 27. Michigan residents should
take advantage of the comment period by
going to www.regulations.gov and show-
ing support for the proposal. The Great
Lakes are Michigan's pride and joy, and it's
imperative that Congress takes whatever
steps are necessary to protect them.

Look, I'll talk, but you can't use
myname or anything, or maybe
you could use, you know, a fake
one, but it would
have to be some-
thing interesting _
like Cobra or Zeus
or ... I mean, I've
thought a lot about
choosing a good
name when the
time comes, and I
made a list, but I WILL
forgot it and I can'tG
remember the best GRUNDLER
names so I'll have
to get back to you
on that, but honestly I'm nervous and
I just really, really need to get this off
my chest.
I mean, I don't want to get anyone
in trouble or anything, but when I
found out that you guys were doing
an investigation of, you know, the
academics here, not just the football
team, and wanted some input from
students, I can't say I was completely
opposed to it. The investigation, that
is. Honestly, I don't know if what
I tell you would qualify as a good
hard-hitting story, but you know, if
you say so.
Well, I would definitely agree that
the academic hours I put in at the
University are excessive. It's a huge
mental and physical strain, especially
when you're coming right out of high
school. In my high school, you know,
and I'd say this is the same for most

high schools, except maybe those in
the Upper Peninsula that have their
own special rules because of the
bears, I'd usually be home by 2 or 3
p.m. at the latest. Then, after I was
home, I would have an average of only
an hour of homework to do, so at most
I was putting in five hours of work a
week for school.
Here at the University, though,
well, hoo boy. I mean, after my class-
es are all done and I've been to the
library and I've fed the squirrels on
the Diag, I'm not getting home until
five, six o'clock, and then, jeez, here's
the part that really sweats my gears,
I've got way more than one hour of
work to do. Try four hours, at a mini-
mum, and if you count Internet poker
breaks the total comes to five hours.
I didn't sign up for that. Well, the
Internet poker I did, but don't men-
tion it because it's sort of illegal in
the States.
Of course, things got really bad
when I started missing my rec bas-
ketball games. I would be at the
library or in class and my team-
mates would call me and say, "Dude,
where's our water? You were sup-
posed to bring it, that's your job,"
and I would have to explain in a
quiet tone so I wouldn't upset the
professor or anybody nearby that I
couldn't make it right now, and to go
use the drinking fountain, but they
didn't take that too well and soon
they got a new water boy.
Like this summer, I was complete-

ly burned out. I mean completely.
Zero energy. All I could do was sit
in front of the TV or the computer.
Sometimes they wouldn't even be on.
So I was just sitting, wishing they
were on, praying that someone would
come and turn them on, or feed me,
but I could never make the effort, you
understand, to do anything myself. At
one point, I didn't shower or shave for
twelve days. Man, if you had seen me
... Well, I mean, if you somehow had
seen me, I would probably have had
a bit of stubble after the twelve days
but nothing seriously resembling a
beard, to tell the truth. But I could
maybe have used a shower.
The nasty rumors
are true: students
work too hard.
So yeah, the rumors are true. I
mean, it's really toughhere. I can't say
I was expecting it. That's why I was
so drained this summer. Oh - you
have to go? Okay. Yeah. Are you sure
you want to print this? Well. I mean,
yeah. Um, don't use my name, okay?
Use ... Neptune. Neptune's good.

Adding coor toU

The newly constructed additionto the Museum
of Modern Art on the corner of State Street and
South University has considerably changed the
aesthetic panorama of Central Campus. Grow-
ing up 20 miles from Ann Arbor, the view facing
east from State Street always came to mind when
I thought of the University of Michigan. Angell
Hall, with its enormous width and towering
Roman columns, looked like it'd been slammed
down in its place by some giant. The trees, some
of them older than my grandparents, spoke to the
stability and historyofthe campus.
But the new addition to the Museum of Mod-
ern Art doesn't fit in with my vision of the Uni-
versity. The straight lines, right angles, walls of
glass and slabs of concrete seem architecturally
at odds not only with the classic buildings which
surround much of the Diag, but also with the
original Museum of Modern Art.
Initially, I was disgusted by the costly muse-
um addition. On top of the issues I had with the
incongruity of the building, it transformed a
grassy, shaded area of the Diag into an enormous
concrete walkway. "Why don't we just lay con-
crete over the entire Diag?" I thought. Out with
natural settings, in with modern design. Those
80 year-old trees were so 20th century. I figured
the addition to the Museum of Modern Art would
end up being the new Dennison - a true WTF
moment in University history.
Passing by the construction site last fall, star-
ing up at two stories of horizontal concrete
slabs, I had an idea. Maybe the University could
put something on those walls. The University
removed all the grass, trees and dirt (color), and
replaced them with huge slabs of clean, cut con-
crete (gray). Why so serious? Why so austere?
Isn't this Ann Arbor, the liberal mecca of the
Midwest?Aren't there students at this institution
artistically skilled enough to transform these
graywalls into something beautiful?
Of course, the University has the right to clas-
sify whatever it likes as art. If it says three large,
metal support beams painted orange and bolted
together is art, so be it. But what statement is the

University making when the art it chooses starts
more conversations regarding the definition
of art than the value or beauty of the piece? My
guess is that the University is saying, "We're all
about theory here at Michigan."
But the sculptures are fine. They're unique
and they add at least a little bit of color to an oth-
erwise drab part of campus. They're also highly
conceptual, so I'm not surprised that their design
goes over my head.
But how about adding something with a little
bit of culture, something that perhaps a few
more students on campus could relate to? Some-
thing a little less stuffy, or maybe even some-
thing the students of the University have some
say in? I know the perfect place for it. There's
a horizontal rectangle of concrete on the north
wall of the museum addition that would accom-
modate either one large mural or many small
ones. It can be aesthetically modern, since
that's all the University feels like building late-
ly. Abstract? Go for it. It could be anything, as
long as it adds some color.
The University should hold a competition for
student artists (or those in the community) for
the opportunity to paint that enormously bor-
ing wall. The price of said competition? Cheap.
The University pays for materials and that's it.
Cheaper than a single bright orange support
beam, I bet. Another perk of the mural idea
- it could be changed. Every semester, year
or decade, the competition is held again, and a
brand new mural goes up for people to examine,
talk and argue about.
Allow students to have some creative con-
trol over how their environment is aesthetically
changed. Why not allow some artistically gifted
students to display their genius and become
voices in the way our University evolves and
changes? The University has an opportunity to
give students the artistic license to create what-
ever they like out of a boring campus building.
What's more modern and progressive than that?

The coffee conspiracy

Have you ever met one of those
idealists who wants to scale Mount
Rushmore to throw protest banners
over Lincoln's nose the instant their
sense of justice is even slightly violat-
ed? Well, I'm one of those people. And
I'm now engaged in an ongoing battle
involving coffee beverages.
I didn't always consider myself
a coffee warrior. There was a time
when I believed coffee was just a
tasty and aromatic liquid that one
must chug daily and in exorbitant
quantities to experience pleasure and
the illusion of being wakeful. But my
views changed one day when my lov-
ing gaze fell on a caramel cafe latte
and I thought about where this nec-
tar of the gods actually comes from.
My first guess was trees. I was
close - coffee grows on bushes, pri-
marily in Brazil, Columbia and Viet-
nam. Around 1000 CE, coffee was
introduced to Arabia, where coffee
bushes remained a closely guarded
treasure until 1616. That's when the
Dutch successfully swiped a cof-
fee bush and brought it to Europe.
Demand for Java quickly rose as afflu-
ent Europeans gathered in cafes and
slurped cups of Joe. Voltaire report-
edly consumed 50 to 72 cups per day,
and to support Voltaire's habit, coffee
cultivation was outsourced to various
colonies where, in many cases, it's
still grown.
Today, coffee is a Goliath industry
- petroleum is the only commodity
that ranks higher than coffee in terms
of dollars spent in trade. According to

Coffee Universe, over 400 billion cups
of Java are consumed each year, mak-
ing it the world's most popular bever-
age. And why not? Coffee stimulates
the brain, is an integral cultural arti-
fact and (arguably) tastes heavenly.
The problem is that there's a dark
side to coffee. For one thing, coffee-
growing has big and ugly impacts on
the environment. Among the things
it causes are destruction of habitats,
deforestation, pesticide pollution and
degradation of soil and water. Add to
that the fact that a single cup requires
more than of 35 gallons of water to
produce (often in countries where
drinking water is already scarce) and
you have a large-scale and far-reach-
ing environmental problem.
Java raises social justice issues,
too. Corporations make billions sell-
ing coffee, but the farmers that actu-
ally exert the time and effort to grow
it typically see very little of that
money. often, farmers lack direct
access to coffee markets and have
little choice but to sell their coffee to
better-connected middlemen - at a
fraction of the price the middleman
will receive and an even smaller frac-
tion of what the end seller receives.
For many growers, the result is a
cycle of poverty, debt and sweatshop-
esque working conditions.
I personally don't like any of those
things, and unfortunately there's no
easy solution to the problems sur-
rounding coffee. But there are some
things a student can do without sac-
rificing coffee and all of its magical

benefits. In my case, I've decided to
start buying fair trade coffee rather
than the other stuff. Fair trade cer-
tified coffee cuts out exploitative
middlemen by replacing them with
cooperatives that offer farmers a fair-
er price for their harvest.
Fair trade coffee is also fairly
easy to find on campus, if you simply
watch out for the label. Some of the
places offering fair trade coffee in
Ann Arbor are Beansters. Expresso
Royale, and Bert's.
And, according to the Organic
Trade Association, 78 percent of all
fair trade certified coffee sold in the
United States is also certified organ-
ic, meaning that it's grown using
more environmentally sustainable
pnethods. For instance, organic coffee
is grown without artificial pesticides
and with sustainable crop rotation
that mitigates problems like soil and
water erosion.
Our consumption decisions and
the businesses we support have real
and noticeable effects on other peo-
ple and the environment. Drinking
a cup of fair trade coffee or writing
a viewpoint about it doesn't right all
the wrongs in the world. But it hope-
fully does make a tiny difference,
and even tiny differences can really
add up in the long run. I now drink
my coffee with a little milk, no sugar
and a sense of pride from know-
ing it got into my cup the right way.

Crash-test
dummies in
real life

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily TV/New Media Editor
Everybody knows there's only
onerealreasonto watch NASCAR:
the crashes.
Without them, *
there would
be very little &
entertainment
in watching Coure
cars drive coun- Wednesdays
terclockwise at 9p.m.
around the same ABC
track 200 times.
People root for
drivers simply because hours of
race-watching yield only seconds
of crashes. And after investing so
much time in a hobby, it would be
a shame not to develop personal
attachments to your favorite rac-
ers via seeing them at their most
automotively desparate.
To alleviate the long bore that
is the sport of NASCAR, ABC has
developed "Crash Course," a new
game show focusing only on the
best - and most destructive -
parts of racing.
The show chronicles five two-
man teams as they take turns
competing in dangerous stunts
for $50,000 and the coveted Gold
Steering Wheel. For each chal-
lenge, the team who doesn't com-
plete the obstacle or takes the
longest to finish is eliminated, and
the last team remaining wins. It

sounds simple enough. But when
the stunts involve driving a car
onto a moving flatbed truck full of
barrels, theyoftenresultin flipped
vehicles and require the use of a
fire extinguisher or two.
The relationships between team
members include everything from
siblings to roommates to married
couples to best friends. Each per-
son is loud, excited and perfect for
a TV game show. Because every-
one is so outrageous, it's easy to
mock the contestants. Rooting for
someone is only a matter of choos-
ing between the most and least
obnoxious teams.
Of course, by picking such col-
orful contestants, "Crash Course"
runs the risk of becoming more

NASCAR, but

prides itself on focusing on the
people behind the wheel, but with-
out some restraint the show could
lose track of itself and become

The freshest catch

Miyazaki's newest animated
film is on par with his
typical standard of excellence
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
More than most other so-called "kids" mov-

ies, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo"
actually seems to understand
what life is like for a child.
Its main character, the five-
year-old Sosuke, is impres-
sionable enough to take for
granted the fact that his pet
fish has suddenly turned into a
human. He's less frightened by
encounters with magical crea-
tures than he is when his mom

moment of bravery comes not from defeating
any evil villain, but from simply watching over
the house while his mom has to run out in an
emergency.
This attention to the details of a child's life
shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone famil-
iar with Miyazaki's previous films. Most of his
earlier features have starred young children on
simple quests who either enter a world of magic
or let the magic come to them. There's a reason
why Miyazaki is the most revered living anima-
tor in the world today: His films are meticulously
crafted works of beauty that attempt to engage
people of all ages in his audience. And he typi-
cally succeeds in that mission.
Ponyo - a fish who longs to be human - is
taken in by a little boy in a coastal village, much
to the frustration of her human-despising wiz-
ard fish father, who floods the town in his anger
until Ponyo can prove to him that she can sup-
port herself on two feet (literally). It's a simple
retelling of "The Little Mermaid" - emphasis

on "simple."
"Ponyo," though equally as charming and
magnificent to look at as any previous Miyazaki
film, is not quite as successful atbridgingthe gap
between his younger and older audiences. It's
closer in spirit to 1988's "My Neighbor Totoro,"
about two little girls who find a giant mythical
animal in their backyard, than to 2001's "Spirit-
ed Away," about a girl who must work in a spirits'
bathhouse to free her captured parents.
Confidentially, "Spirited Away" is this
reviewer's favorite film, animated or oth-
erwise. It touches on many adult themes,
including the evils of human greed and the
importance of maintaining one's own identity,
while at the same time entertaining younger
viewers with cute creatures and slapstick
humor. It's a bit disappointing to discover
that "Ponyo" is more interested in appealing
to the latter demographicthough it does have
a strong message about family and love (but

thing in the show is already avail-

For Thursday, Sept. 10, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
You feel a need to communicate or
enlighten others about something, espe-
cially with ex-partners on the scene and
chaotic activity making demands at
home. Turn to romantic or entertaining
diversions for pleasure.
TAURUS
(April 20to May 20)
Avoid important money decisions this
morning; however, this afternoon your
thinking is more grounded. You're con-
vincing if you have to sell, teach or mar-
ket anything.
GEMINI
(May 21to June 20)
Today the Moon is in your sign, giving
you extra good luck. Use this to your
advantage. (It might make you a bit
more emotional than usual aswell.)
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
You're best served today by working
alone or behind the scenes. Try to enjoy
some moments of privacy in beautiful
surroundings. Take a walk in a park.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
This is a lovely day to schmooze with
others, especially female friends and
acquaintances. Group activities will
please you. People from the past are
popping up in your life again!
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Some aspect of your life will be made
public today. Just be aware of this so that
you're conscious of how you dress, act
and speak.
LIBRA

Even though you have a desire to work

from other cultures and different coun-
tries.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Wrap up loose details about inheri-
tances, insurance matters, shared prop-
erty and such. Make a little headway if
you can.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Today's Moon is directly opposite
your sign, which means you have to go
more than halfway when dealing with
others. It's not really a big deal.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Make a list of what you want to do
today, and see how much you can get
done. Whatever you accomplish will
give you a strong satisfaction and a sense
of reward.
AQUARIUS

This is a playful, flirtatious day! Enjoy
the arts, sports, and fun times with chil-
dren. Keep things lighthearted. It's a
great day to get away on a vacation.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Discussions with family members will
be significant today. Make sure you lis-
ten to others as well as speak to them.
Someone needs to confide in you today.
YOU BORN TODAY It's important
for you to discover where you fitin the
bigger scheme of things. Some of you
can be totally immersed in your career.

PRANKED
* From Page 5A
on CollegeHumor.com is a perfect example of dis-
comforting gags done right, with a premise that's
basic enough: Seidell and Blumenfeld pull pranks
on each other. But their willingness to escalate the
situation and the subsequent uncomfortable chaos
(in one memorable episode, Blumenfeld secretly
arranged a public proposal from Seidell to his girl-
friend at Yankee Stadium) makes that series work
well.
It's a shame that "Pranked" can't muster up any-
thing near the same level of ingenuity. The clips each
episode features are banal enough to make "Ameri-
ca's Funniest Home Videos" seem classy. So far,
the show has featured clips of assorted sophomoric
shamings, various gags involving private areas of
the body being inserted into non-private areas and
in one confusing case, a man pranking his cat.
The problem is the inherent unpleasantness in
the featured clips. Instead of clips that could be
funny by themselves, the show's bread and butter

is less "laughing with" and more "laughing at." For
example, the pilot episode featured a son playing a
series of pranks on his redneck dad who would make
Jeff Foxworthy look like a New Yorker subscriber.
The pranks the son pulls are unimaginative - he
sprays the living room with a stink bomb and tapes
down the sprayer head on the sink - but when the
dad starts swearing and vowing to "beat the shit"
out of his son, it's hard to know whether to laugh or
call child services.
With all the clips being selected from the mas-
sive goldmine that is the Internet, good videos occa-
sionally surface on "franked," but they're few and
far between. Hosts Blumenfeld and Seidell do what
they can with their material, but their banter and
commentary is mostly forgettable.
Overall, it's easy to see what niche "Pranked"
aspires to fill. So long as the sun continues to rise
and fall, people are always going to find a well-done
prank amusing. But "Pranked" has a mentality
that's insulting to anyone with opposable thumbs.
And with so many better outlets delivering the
same thing today, it's hard to find a reason to bother
watching it.

PONYO
From Page 5A
what G-rated movie doesn't?).
With "Ponyo," Miyazaki
doesn't seem to be aiming as high,
thematically, as he has in the past.
At its heart, the film is a cute fairy
tale, albeit one that's breathtak-
ing to look at. All the life forms in
the sea are lovingly detailed, and
there's a bravura action sequence
when Ponyo breaks free of her
underwater prison by riding on
the back of a school of fish.

As with Miyazaki's previous
Disney-distributed films, Pixar
vice president John Lasseter
("Toy Story") supervised the
dubbing while also serving as an
executive producer. Determined
to reel in mass American audi-
ences, he lined up an A-list cast
for the English-language version,
including Liam Neeson, Tina Fey
and Matt Damon. Ponyo is voiced
by Miley Cyrus's little sister
Noah, and Sosuke by the "lost
Jonas brother" Frankie Jonas;
the two up-and-comers can take
solace in knowing that, with this
one film, they've already gar-

nered more critical acclaim than
the combined efforts of their
older siblings.
When it comes down to it,
"Ponyo" isn't meant to be taken as
anything more than a children's
flick. And in truth, there really
isn't anything wrong with that.
The little kids in the theater abso-
lutely adored it, and witnessing
their admiration for a Miyazaki
movie was incredibly rewarding.
Every young generation needs a
special movie to act as a "gateway
film" for more sophisticated mov-
ies. For the children of the late
2000s, that film could be "Ponyo."

Moments before a gruesome death.

CRASH COURSE
From Page 5A
nothing more than another cheap reality show. For
now, the show's competitors are fashioned after those
on "The Price is Right," but it won't take much for a
"Flavor of Love" attitude to take over.
The art of being a game show host has somewhat
diminished over the years as game shows have shift-
ed into reality programming. But the hosts of "Crash
Course" are refreshing and talented. Dan Cortese
("What I Like About You") and Orlando Jones ("Drum-
line") have no reservations about ridiculing the con-
testants, often saying exactly what those at home must
be thinking. Their painfully honest style of hosting is
hilarious and they work well as a team.

Whilethesubjectson"CrashCourse"arefuntowatch,
the show's gimmick - cars getting wrecked by average
Joes - is why people should (and will) tune in. Unfor-
tunately, of the four obstacles per show, only one each
episode has been anything remotely dangerous (read:
totally kickass). The final course is exactly the same on
each episode and the finale is extremely anticlimactic.
And though the show's running time of one hour is way
less than those never-ending NASCAR races, itstill feels
alittle toolong for too few crashes.
"Crash Course" is great to watch for an episode
or two. The contestants are eccentric, the hosts
unabashed and the crashes satisfying. The producers
ought to introduce more dangerous stunts and contin-
ue to carefully select the competitors in order to make
"Crash Course" something worth watching on a regu-
lar basis. But really, if you can sit through NASCAR,
you can sit through anything.

mation is available.
Margaret Rodriguez, the Uni-
versity's senior associate direc-
tor of financial aid, said there's an
estimated 5,000 students at the
University slated to receive the
scholarship this academic year.
In response to concerns from
students and parents regarding the
potential end of the scholarship,
the office of Financial Aid sent out
e-mails on August 13 to students
awaiting word on whether the
funding will be cut.
Students who receive need-
based financial aid in addition to
the Michigan Promise Scholarship
were told to pay the balances on
their student accounts minus the
grant amount they would receive
through the scholarship. If the
funds do not come through, the
HEALTH CARE
From Page 1A
"To take on cost-containment,
[universal] access and make the
promise of cost neutrality to the
federal budget, in terms of no new
deficit creations, was a Herculean
task," Fendrick said, referencing
a pledge by the president to make
his health care reform plans deficit
neutral over the next 10 years.
Fendrick is also the co-director
ofthe University's Center forValue-
Based Insurance Design. He said
the Value-Based Insurance Design
model is the type of incremental
reform that he would recommend
to provide forlong-term cost reduc-
tion and encourage general health.
"The basic premise of Value-
Based Insurance Design is to set up
the situation where, instead of all
doctor visits, diagnostic tests and
drugs costing patients the same,
we actually put strong financial
and non-financial barriers in place
for people to do the things that we
really want them to do," he said.
Value-Based Insurance Design
has gained recognition as the model
for a recent legislative proposal in
the U.S. Senate designed to benefit
Medicare recipients. The biparti-
san proposal intends to lower out-

e-mail said, the students would
be considered for "additional aid,"
though these supplemental awards
are not guaranteed.
The e-mail stated that stu-
dents who do not receive need-
based financial aid should "make
arrangements to cover the amount
of your Michigan Promise Scholar-
ship with other resources," and if
the scholarship ultimately comes
through, the scholarship sum will
then be credited to the student's
account.
"We will honor our commitment
to students who have need but we
are not responsible for all state pro-
grams," Fowler said. "Any scholar-
ship is important to students to pay
for their education, especially inthe
state of Michigan where we have a
lot of families who don't have the
resources they had a year ago."
LSA junior Kimberly Tolbert,
of-pocket costs and encourage the
use of high-value treatments in lieu
of patients undergoing more costly
procedures.
While much of the focus on
health care reform has been eco-
nomic and political, institutional
changes to medical schools are
another important factor to consid-
er in the long term, Fendrick said.
A shift toward providing greater
health care access, he said, would
increase the demand for primary
care physicians - a change that
should be reflected in medical cur-
riculum on campuses around the
country and, later, in compensa-
tion.
"As the movement goes to pay
clinicians based on the quality of
care and health they produce, it
would make complete sense to seea
substantial increase in the payment
of those primary care providers,"
he said.
LSA senior Arun Hariharan,
however, is not entirely convinced
that a salary increase is awaiting
primary care physicians in the near
future. In the process of applying
to medical schools, Hariharan said
he is uneasy about the prospect of
entering a potentially new land-
scape of health care.
"I'm nervous,",Hariharan said.
"I was in the first class to take the

$1,000 this year through the Mich-
igan Promise Scholarship, said the
timing of the notifications left little
room to change her plans regarding
tuition payment.
Tolbert, who also receives other
financial aid, said that if the schol-
arship doesn't come through she'
will look toward other forms of
financial aid and scholarships.
"It's really unfortunate if they
do, cause I know that the e-mail got
sent toward the end of the summer
and we're still expected to pay the
full amount that we owe, so a lot of
people have to do that last minute,

earlier, then plans could have been
made more in advance," Tolbert
said.

new SAT, the new MCAT, but this is
huge - it's your profession."
Hariharan said that a pay cut
would not deter him from pur-
suing medicine, but given the
state of the economy and medi-
cal school expenses, he said he
might reconsider his options to
pursue an administrative role in
health care as opposed to a clini-
cal one.
"Doctors are going to be affect-
ed monetarily for sure, but I don't
think it's going to be substantial
enough to change their way of liv-
ing or patient care," he said.
Hariharan, the president of
Alpha Epsilon Delta - a pre-health
honors society - said he is con-
cerned about students meeting the
demand for general practitioners.
He anticipates not only decreased
membership in pre-health organi-
zations in the near future but also
fewer overall students in the pre-
medical track.
"I think they're going to be dis-
suaded," said Hariharan. "Given
the economic troubles, it's hard for
people to make this decision and
not know where they're heading.
When there's a clear establishment
of how doctors and patient care are
going to be affected, then there will
be more stability in students' deci-
sions."

School.
Because University students
tend to be around a lot of crowds,
protecting themselves with fre-
quent hand washing and use of a
hand sanitizer is a good strategy to
try to avoid influenza, Ernst said,
adding that students should carry
personal hand sanitizer with them
in case they are in a place where
they can't wash their hands.
Students who live in apartments

several officials said.

SU' drops one spot in
recent rankings, but
officials don't mind

SCREAMING IN THE RAIN

Spokesman: Ranking
methodologies don't
line up with 'U'
priorities
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
In its 2010 list of the Best
American Colleges and Universi-
ties, U.S. News and World Report
ranked the University at No. 27 -
down one spot from the previous
year - but University officials say
the drop doesn't mean the quality
of the school has slipped.
"We are very proud of the fact
that the University of Michigan
always ranks highly," University
Spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said.
"If it drops a place or two from
year to year it isn't really very
meaningful. Nationally we consis-
tently rank high."
The University of Michigan,
which in 2007 tied with the Uni-
versity of California at Los Ange-
les as the second best public school
on the list, is now in the No. 4 spot
behind the University of Califor-
nia at Berkeley, ranked at No. 21
among all universities, UCLA and
the University of Virginia, tied at
No.24.
Fitzgerald said a change in
ranking does not necessarily mean
that the school in question has sig-
nificantly improved or worsened,

but that the change reflects a shift
in the ranking system, altering the
overall outcome.
"In all of these different rank-
ings, the methodology does change
from year to year and it changes
how things are weighted, which
can alter our spot in the rankings,"
Fitzgerald said.
A major factor incorporated
into U.S. News and World Report's
method for ranking universities is
the expenditure per student: the
more money a university spends
per student, the higher rating it
receives.
Citingthe expenditure factor for
the U.S. News and World Report's
ranking, Fitzgerald explained that
the system is much more subjec-
tive than is perceived by the gen-
eral public.
"If we've found a more efficient
way of spending our money, we do
not need excessive spending per
student," Fitzgerald explained.
"The University of Michigan
can be penalized because it's not
spending more, which doesn't nec-
essarily make it automatically bet-
ter."
But U.S. News and World Report
isn't the only national ranking sys-
tem to use this method of money
spent per student.
On its 2009 list of "America's
Best Colleges," Forbes Magazine
placed the University of Michigan
at No. 200.
Larger public schools are less
common on the Forbes list than

private institutions because of
the different factors considered as
part of the ranking's methodology.
The only public schools found in
the top 25 on the list were the U.S.
Military Academy and the U.S. Air
Force Academy.
Though the monetary aspect of
ranking appears to hurt the Uni-
versity's standing, Washington
Monthly's ranking of national uni-
versities for 2009 has the Univer-
sity as No. 18.
The Washington Monthly bases
its ranking on three main catego-
ries: the recruitment and gradu-
ation of low-income students,
research the school conducts and
the encouragement of students to
give back to the community.
Focusing primarily on the
amount of research done by uni-
versities and the grants they
receive, the Washington Monthly
ignores the amount of money spent
by schools for each student, gear-
ing the entire list toward readers
who are looking for schools that
conduct the maximum amount of
research.
Fitzgerald said that because the
methodologies are not outwardly
obvious to college guide readers, a
school's ranking on any list can be
misleading.
"These kinds of rankings take
things that are very subjective,"
he said. "We don't think that that's
the best way for students to choose
where to go to college. There is no
one best college for everyone."

Detroit students head back to
their classroom-s a mid upheaval

Restructuring has
closed 29 schools,
overhauled others
DETROIT (AP) - Students in
Detroit's public schools returned
to class yesterday amid a mas-
sive restructuring that has closed
29 schools, overhauled scores of
others and created a mixture of
optimism and anxiety about the
troubled district's future.
Dozens of parents lined up to
register their children at Durfee,
which is gettingstudents from two
other schools that closed. Enroll-
ment at the school, which has pre-
kindergartners through eighth

graders, is more than doubling to
about 1,000.
"The overcrowding is a real
big issue, so I hope that with
them bringing in other schools
it won't overcrowd this school
too much," said Sabrina Howard.
"We'll see."
Howard's son, 10-year-old
Kovysims, is entering fifth grade.
They recently moved near Durfee
from another part of the city and
Howard said she was unhappy
with overcrowding at his previous
school.
Yesterday was the first day of
class for Michigan public schools.
The Detroit Public Schools dis-
trict, which now has 172 schools, is
trying to deal with years of plum-

meting enrollment and ease con-
cerns about student safety.
Overall, Howard said, changes
put into place by state-appointed
emergency financial manager
Robert Bobb left her optimistic.
Bobb is trying to improve educa-
tion, tackle fraud and deal with a
$259 million deficit.
"Will there be issues? Yes. Will
we address these issues quickly?
Absolutely, yes," Bbb told report-
ers at Western International High
School.
Bobbsaid it'sa"nervousstart"to
the school year. Problems included
a transportation hot line for par-
ents being inadequately staffed,
but he said those issues were being
addressed.

FAN CANS
From Page 1A
early last September, Coleman
explained what she called an "easy"
decision not to sign the petition.
"I certainly respect people who
want to stimulate a discussion and
I think that's what the Amethyst
Initiative was all about," Coleman
said. "What I disagree with is the
notion that lowering the drinking
age is going to somehow alleviate
the problem."
Coleman did say at the time
that she agreed with the petition's
characterization of the alcohol
problem on campuses.
"This whole issue of binge
drinking, particularly the kind of
destructive, frequent hinging on
alcohol, is a big issue, and it's a big
problem on college campuses," she
said. "And it's one that I certainly
think deserves a lot of discussion,
a lot of attention about trying to
find solutions."
Ari Parritz, President of the
Interfraternity Council, wrote in
an e-mail late last month that he
agrees with the University's posi-
tion on the "Fan Cans," but added
that more needs to be done to
combat binge drinking at the Uni-
versity.
"I emphatically stand with the
University in its fight against binge
drinking and underage consump-
tion," Parritz, a Public Policy senior,
wrote. "Do I think Maize and Blue
beer cans will spike consumption
on football Saturdays? Probably
not."
He added: "However, I believe
there are more salient ways to fight
alcohol abuse on campus than to
petition against Anheuser-Busch."
The Federal Trade Commission
shares the University's concerns
on underage drinking. Janet Evans,
a senior attorney-at the FTC who
oversees alcohol marketing issues,
told The Associated Press that
regulators are concerned the cam-
paign could encourage underage
drinking.
"When you've got a college
campus audience you've got a
very large number of persons who
are below the legal drinking age
there, and in addition, you've got
a population that engages almost
exclusively in binge drinking,"
she said.
After correspondence with the
University, the St. Louis-based
beer company agreed not to sell
the yellow and blue cans in the
University "community," but did
not specify what, exactly, that
meant.
The beer company has sent
similar letters to those received
by the University to other
schools and colleges that have
complained.
In a letter to Boston College
administrators, Anheuser-Busch
reasserted its intention to produce
cans with the school's colors, while
making a concession similar to the
one Michigan received, according
to the Associated Press.
"Nonetheless, in order to avoid
a disputetover tconcerns raised
hy your letter, Ak euser-Busch has

decided not to proceed with Fan
Cans in such color combinations in
your community at this time," the
letter read.
In a return letter to Anheuser-
Busch, the University asserted that
the school's "community" reaches
beyond Ann Arbor's borders.
"To assure that there is no confu-
sion, the University of Michigan is
a statewide public institution," the
letter read. "Accordingly, it consid-
ers 'its community' to be the entire
state of Michigan."

In a statement released by
Anheuser-Busch, Carol Clark,
vice president of Corporate Social
Responsibility, wrote that despite
the "Fan Cans," the company's atti-
tude toward underage drinking is
unambiguous.
"Anheuser-Busch has a long-
standing commitment to promoting
responsible drinking," Clark wrote
in the release. "Our company's posi-
tion on college drinking is clear: If
students are 21 or older and choose
to drink, we want them to do so

responsibly; if they are under 21, we
want them to respect the law and
not drink."
Though many schools, includ-
ing the University of Wisconsin
and Boston College, are also ask-
ing Anheuser-Busch to stop selling
cans with their school colors close
to campus, other schools including
Louisiana State University aren't
stopping the Fan Cans from coming
to their area.
LSU Chancellor Michael Mar-
tin issued a statement endorsing

the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission's position against the Fan
Cans, which, according to a recent
Wall Street Journal article, calls
the program "socially irresponsi-
ble." But Martin added that the new
marketing campaign is the least of
his worries.
"As an aside, given HiNi, a
national recession, global climate
change, raising high school dropout
rates, the retirement of great fac-
ulty, deferred maintenance on this
and many other campuses, among

other pressing issues, the color of
beer cans has not risen to the top of
our urgency index," Martin wrote
in the statement.
Back in Ann Arbor, LSA sopho-
more Adam Steuer said when he's
looking for a drink on Football Sat-
urday, it doesn't matter what the
can looks like.
"It's unfortunate for Anheuser-
Buschbecause they would have sold
more beer," he said, "but what's on
the inside of the can is more impor-
tant than what's on the outside."

iOOverlooked M
sports moments of the summer

0

Some pretty amazing things happened in the world of Michigan sports this summer, and they were away from the football field, basketball
court and hockey rink. We're talking national championships, College World Series runs and one of the biggest upsets in a team's history. But
most of the Wolverines' smaller sports are constantly overlooked, especially when the students leave campus for the summer.
Here are the top five storylines from this summer that you need to know:

a

Juliana Paz, Lexi Zimmerman and Sloane Donhoff helped 'M' beat Nebraska.

5 Baseball's disastrous
disappointment
After six straight postseason
appearances in the Big Ten Tourna-
ment, the Michigan baseball team's
season ended during a sunny week-
end in May in Evanston, Ill.
Michigan finished 7th in the Big
Ten - the lowest ever under Wol-
verine baseball coach Rich Maloney
in his seven seasons with the Wol-
verines.
The loss was extremely disap-
pointing following three straight
Big Ten Titles and four straight
NCAA Tournament appearances.
Michigan started the season with
high hopes and was led by strong
individual performances through-
out the season by fifth-year senior
pitcher Chris Fetter, who finished
a strong 7-3 in 13 starts with a 3.26
ERA. The Wolverines also started
left-handed junior pitcher Eric
Katzman, who started 14 games to
finish 7-4 with a 3.56 ERA. Katz-
man wasn't always reliable, but nei-
ther was the rest of the Wolverines'
pitching staff.
Michigan did toy with bringing
in junior first baseman and relief
pitcher Mike Dufek in to be the
closer in close games. Dufek pitched
16.2 innings in 11 games, only allow-
ing five earned runs and striking out
21 batters.
On offense, the team was led in
large part by Dufek and sophomore
center fielder Ryan LaMarre. LaMa-
rre batted third and led the team
with a .344 batting average and 62
RBI's. Dufek led the team with his
17 home runs.
Even with a few individual suc-
cesses, Michigan couldn't over-
come injuries, alack of consistency,
and a few disappointing losses to
Mid-American Conference teams
as it failed to repeat as Big Ten
Champions.

4 Volleyball upsets
No. 3 Nebraska
While students were busy coming
back to campus at the end of August,
the Michigan volleyball team was
busy earning the biggest win in pro-
gram history, a straight-set victory
over No. 3 Nebraska on Aug. 28.
It started out tight as the Wolver-
ines squeaked out a 25-23 win in the
first set. But from then on, Michigan
widened its margin of victory in each
subsequent set, taking the second
25-21 and the third 25-17. Junior Lexi
Zimmerman and sophomore Alex
Hunt led the charge with Zimmer-
man's 33 assists and Hunt's 14 kills.
It marked the first time ever that
the Wolverines had defeated a top-
five team and it catapulted them to
a No. 7 ranking, another program
record. It appears the upset win got'
the team rolling in general, too, as
Michigan has reeled off fourstraight
wins since that season opener.
The Wolverines now boast a per-
fect 5-0 record and rigorous confer-
ence play begins in two weeks. But
for the first time in program history,
they'll face teams like top-ranked
Penn State with the confidence that
comes from a huge upset. On the
very first day of the season, Michi-
gan proved it can compete with any-
one. And now, the Wolverines have a
chance to beat everyone.
3 Ofili and Gall win
national titles
At the NCAA Outdoor Track
and Field Championships on June
13, now-graduated Geena Gall and
Tiffany Ofili carried the day for the
Wolverines by winning individual'
national championships. The pair
led the Wolverines to a seventh-
place finish, Michigan women's
track and field coach James Hen-
ry's third consecutive top-10
finish at nationals.
Ofili's title in the 100-meter
hurdles was her third consecu-
tive in the event and her fifth
overall title at Michigan. With
the victory, Ofili became the
first ever Wolverine to three-

peat as a national champion. Ofili
defeated the runner-up by nearly
two-tenths of a second, while less
than four-tenths of a second sepa-
rated second place from eighth
place.
Shortly after her blister-
ing performance at the National
Championships, Ofili, now an
Adidas-signed runner, raced at the
USA Track and Field Champion-
ships. She barely missed the cut
to represent the USA at the World
Championships, placing fourth.
Ofili's teammate and roommate,
Gall, won her second consecutive
800-meter run championship and
picked up her 10th All-American
accolade of her career. Her time
of 2:00.8 was a lifetime best as the
senior led the race from start to fin-
ish.
The Wolverinealso wonthe 800-
meter run indoor national champi-
onship during her junior and senior
campaigns. Following her impres-
sive collegiate career, Gall joined
the professional Oregon Track
Club and represented the USA at
the 2009 World Championships,
placing 14th in the 800-meter run.
2)Softball makes a run
to the CWS
If you're addicted to ESPN and
ESPN2 (likeus),you probablydidn't
miss this. But for the more casual
sports fan, we'll clue you in on the
Michigan softball team's incred-
ible postseason run. It started with
a sparkling 41-10 regular-season
record and a 21-game winning
streak that helped the Wolverines
capture their first outright Big Ten
Championship since 2005. Michi-
gan cruised through regional and
super regional play, earning a trip
to the Women's College World
Series in Oklahoma City.
It marked the first time the Wol-
verines returned to the tournament
since they won it in 2005, the most
recent NCAA team championship
at Michigan. Much of the team's
success can be attributed to the
dynamic pitching duo of Jordan
Taylor and Nikki Nemitz combined
with an explosive offensive attack.

In Oklahoma City, Michigan
erupted for six runs to beat No. 4
Alabama in the first round. But that
would be the Wolverines' final win
of the season after two heartbreak-
ing losses to top-seeded Florida and
red-hot Georgia knocked Michigan
out of the tournament.
Still, the magical run points to
only positive things for the coming
season. Eight of Michigan's nine
starters from last year will return,
including both ace pitchers. A trip
back to the World Series could very
well be in store for the Wolverines.
Lacrosse's back-to-
back titles
The record books say that the last
team national championship won
at Michigan was the 2005 softball
College World Series title. Try tell-
ing that to the lacrosse team.
Although the Wolverines have
yet to gain true varsity status,
lacrosse is one of the fastest-grow-
ing sports on campus - and for
good reason. After two straight
20-win, undefeated seasons, Mich-
igan is the two-time defending
national champion in club varsity
lacrosse.
Along with the 40 straight wins,
Michigan is gaining national noto-
riety. In a move meant to gauge
the team's readiness to make the
jump to varsity, the Wolverines
hosted Army and St. Johns in 2008
in a tournament at Elbel Field.
Although Michigan didn't pull of
either upset, the tournament defi-
nitely got the attention of Athletic
Director Bill Martin, who has the
final say about the varsity situa-
tion.
Back in May, the Wolverines
traveled to Denver to defend their
title against a tough Chapman
squad. They won in a 12-11 barn-
burner.
Few people on campus know
about the lacrosse team, whose
home games are in Oosterbaan
Fieldhouse, the Michigan football
practice facility. But the fans that
do show up are loyal and loud.
Don't be surprised to hear a lot
more about this team in the future.

Pitcher Nikki Nemitz helped lead Michigan to a College World Series appearance.

Speedy Roh a perfect fit
for new 'quick' position

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
During fall camp, Michigan
standout tailback Carlos Brown
was running a route when he
quickly glanced to his left.
Brown couldn't recognize the
6-foot-4, 238-pound freshman who
was running by his side - and actu-
ally keeping up.
"He turned around and looked
at me, and I said, 'That's Craig Roh
running with me right down the
field?' " Brown recalled. "It's ridic-
ulous. He's real fast."
Within defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson's system, Roh plays
a hybrid defensive end/linebacker
position, also known as the "quick".
The Scottsdale, Ariz. native, who
runs a 4.75 40-yard dash, has gar-
nered much attention with his
speed and athleticism.
After battling with redshirt
sophomore Brandon Herron for
much of fall camp, Roh began to set
himself apart. Last Friday, Robin-
son told Roh he would get the start-
ing nod in Saturday's game against
Western Michigan.

"It was so many emotions at the
same time - excitement, nervous-
ness, just a lot of emotions," Roh
said of Saturday's start. "Coach
Robinson, he was very straightfor-
ward. He called me and Brandon
Herron over, and that was that."
Roh turned heads Saturday
when he broke into the offensive
backfield. He finished with four
assisted tackles, including one for a
six-yard loss. The most impressive
play came when Roh and defensive
tackle Ryan Van Bergen combined
for a sack and a nine-yard loss.
"Oh, I seen Craig Roh out there,
you know, sticking his nose in
there, and he did good for today and
all he can do is get better," senior
defensive end Brandon Graham
said Saturday. "He's got a motor,
and he just want to do everything
right. We know he's going to make
his mistakes, but he's going to keep
going out there."
Roh's position requires a fast
defender who can pass rush from
the edge and drop back in coverage.
As with many positions in Robin-
son's system, it demands constant
movement.

The "quick" spot is a new posi-
tion for Roh, who played defensive
end in high school and verbally
committed to Michigan last Sep-
tember under former defensive
coordinator Scott Shafer.
In his senior year of high school,
Roh tallied 16.5 sacks and received
the Arizona Gatorade Player of the
Year award. A rivals.com four-star
recruit, he received offers from
Southern California, UCLA, Arizo-
na State, Nebraska, California and
Stanford.
Roh's biggest criticism remains
his wiry frame, and as Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said
at National Signing Day, he
expects Roh to "grow to 250-some
pounds."
But it's Roh's speed that makes
him adaptable. The switch to the
"quick" position in Robinson's sys-
tem seems like a natural fit.
"I would call him raw," Van Ber-
gen said of Rob during fall camp.
"I think he needs to kind of learn
that there's a lot more scheming
involved in college football. The
athleticism he possesses ... he can
be an excellent player."

Daughters without mothers

here are times when I find
myself sitting on the floor,
with my legs pressed against
my chest and arms wrapped
around my shins, when I look
down at my bare feet and think,
"God, there is nothing more I need
right now than a pedicure and
a mother' Yes, a pedicure and a
mother. The two are of course not
equal in importance. The former
takes precedence in immediacy,
while the latter possesses an ele-
ment of a timelessness endurance
- it is always the suffix to any of
my pragmatic requests. "God,
there is nothing more I need right
now than a haircut and a mother."
A sandwich, a pen, any thought
involving a need never ceases.to
remind me of the primary void
that lingers behind every petty
desire: my mother's absence. Each
time something goes missing from
my life, my grief is in the shape of
my mother's face. I am a mother-
less daughter, and yes, I still need
a pedicure.
The interesting thing about my
mother was that she too was a
woman defined by the premature
loss of her mother. When my sister
and I were young, she would con-
sistently remind us that she never
had a mother to teach her about
bras, periods or shaving her legs.
We were raised to be well aware
of her impermanence. We knew
what it meant to die nearly before
we knew what it meant to be alive.
Mothers, we thought, were tempo-
rary figures. "We must learn to fly
from the coop," ours told us. We
learned we had to break away and
lead our own lives.
There is an aspect of tragic inde-
pendence in the motherless daugh-
ter that I have grown to cherish in
myself, yet simultaneously despise
and resent. My mother lost her
mother at 12 - I lost mine at 14
- so we both walked alone down
the same misguided path, secretly
grasping at any lessons of wom-
anhood we could catch along the
way: the smell of my second grade
teacher's perfume, the rows of
handmade barrettes my mother
clipped to her eyelet curtains, days
and days and days of dirty dishes,
the way my aunt called everybody
"honey." I started collecting these
memories long before my mother

died because she made it clear,
very early, that she would never be
able to give me everything I need-
ed to know.
My entire childhood was devot-
ed to mirroring the ways of a self-
taught caretaker, who after every
misstep repeated the infamous
phrase: "Nobody ever showed me
how to do that." When my sister
and I were young, our hair was
always braided neatly and tight,
with two hairbands and lots of
hairspray. My mother took pride
in the way she had learned on her
dolls to polish her daughters. But
the laundrybaskets were constant-
ly overflowing. Our house was a
colorful mess, freckled with the
decorating tastes of unsupervised
children. Nothing was ever off
limits. The walls were arways cov-
ered in some form of tomato sauce
or fruit juice. We were an entire
home of motherless daughters,
or daughterless mothers, each
one of us contributing in our
own way to an arts-'n-crafts
notion of "mommy" - a collage
we created together of what we
thought mothering was really
about.
Mysister andIwouldcompare
notes over what our friends had
had for dinner. After sleepovers,
we came home with new char-
acteristics of functional house-
holds - like Sarah's family had
a chore chart or Debra's mother
gave her an allowance. Our
mother embraced our search
for normalcy, accepting neces-
sities like Tupperware and Vel-
cro shoes. Yet other times, the
vibrant, practical, swift actions
of well seasoned parents only
revealed how much more dif-
ficult it was for my mother to
raise us. Somewhat irrationally,
she rejected the ideas of Lunch-
ables and carpooling - arbitrary
conventions that seem a staple
in the lives of normal children,
yet were spurned by my mother
as "ordinary" or "boring."
Aside from the ins and outs
of domestic life that eluded our
family, there was a less tangible
but more essential piece of the
puzzle missing. For the moth-
erless daughter, the concept
of womanhood is framed in an
ethereal mystery - a place seen

somewhere off in the horizon, es into my life and steers me in a
I suspect that following my direction I would have otherwise
mother's death I have settled for missed. My friends' mothers, my
less than I deserve in the area of teachers and aunts all mothered
mothering, because the idea of me as much as I allowed them to,
but not nearly as much as they
wanted.
" b y r I may never feel comfortable in
Nobody ever the presence of an older woman.
s e m h Her company only illuminates
all the mothering I should have
to do that." received hut didn't, making me
question the woman I once called
Mom and doubting the mother I
will one day become. When I think
of my mother, I see her barefoot,
embracing a surrogate, a step- struggling to navigate around the
mother or a therapist is bloated kitchen. Her clothes were stained
with guilt and fear. It contains the and torn. I have no idea who taught
knowledge that the replacement me about dry cleaning, but I thank
may be better than the mother I her for unconsciously showing me
actually had. I am faced with a bit- its necessity.
tersweet range of emotions each I can't say who taught me how
time a maternal influence reach- to make lasagna, straighten my

hair, pluck my eyebrows or cry and
kiss in public. I have no idea who
taught me about pedicures and all
the little things that remind me
that I am still in need of a mother.
Nonetheless, I am grateful for the
village of women who shuffled in
and out of my life, unknowingly
shedding pieces of themselves
that have been monumental to
my development. But still, I can-
not silence the little girl inside me
who wonders if it may have been
her very own mess of a mother
who first brushed fresh polish all
over her toes. For with all of her
chasing and falling, my mother
learned, very early, the importance
of knowing how to fly, and wanted,
if nothing else, to teach her daugh-
ters when it was time for them to
get their nails done.

Mustachioed
Michigan men
Football fans sport lip covers
for the season opener
A strange correlation of sports
fandom is that the more diehard the
fan, the more dignity to sacrificed
to support his or her team of choice.
Grown men paint their entire bod-
ies primary colors, dress as animals
and chant rhymes like their lives
depend on it.
But one group of Michigan foot-
ball fans has taken the reverential
humiliation one step farther. You
might have seen some of its mem-
bers at Saturday's game - they were
the guys who looked like they just
stepped off the set of a'70s porno.
Mustaches for Michigan is a
movement started by a group of
University alums who think the
best way for diehard Michigan
fans to support their team at the
first game is to bear their alle-
giance on their upper lip.
"This is kind of our response
to being all in for Michigan," said
Keith Patterson, who helped found
the movement with three alumni
who are also living in Los Angeles.
"It's just kind af samething that
started among us four that's like,
'Let's grow a mustache for that
opener,' and it kind of grew from
there."
Along with Patterson, musta-
chioed Michigan men Jeff McKib-
ben, Will Bransdorfer and Joel
Morgan spread the word to other
fans through a blog they have
diligently tended since July. The
message: grow a beard throughout
August and shave it into a luxuri-
ous 'stache for game day.
The posts on Mustachesfor-
Michigan.com are a combination
of anticipatory enthusiasm for the
start of the season and advice on
mustache care.
"Have you thought about what
style ofmustacheyouwillbesport-
ing on Sept. 5?" reads a post on
Sept. 1that linked to an illustrated
styling guide. "Hopefully, you've
taken into consideration shaving
and grooming into account as you
fantasized about this coming Sat-
urday. So allow us to be the first to

Paul Cummings, a graduate stu- men growing mustaches and one

But mustaches made appear-
ances elsewhere besides Ann Arbor.
At a Michigan alumni gathering in
Washington D.C., 2007 LSA gradu-
ate Dan Taylor said he ran into other
bewhiskered fans.
"We went downto the alumnibar
down in D.C. yesterday, and every
10 or 11 people you'd see with a mus-
tache and you'd give them a high
five or a handshake," Taylor said.
Sadly, Taylor's whiskers were
short-lived, since his wife was not
a fan and Taylor suspected that
his consulting clients wouldn't be
either. But Taylor plans to continue
the tradition and sport a nice, thick
handlebar for next year's season
opener.
To the Mustaches for Michigan
founders, the lip cover is the appro-
priate symbol of support for Michi-
gan football - and the ultimate
expression of strength and style.
"It almost harkens back to the
tale of Samson and Delilah in that
one's power grows as one's mus-
tache increases," Morgan said.

"Delilah shaved Samson's head, he
lost all his power. I'd like to think
that if my mustache were shaved
off of me in the middle of the night
then I'd feel like less of a man in the
morning."
It's hard to predict the future of
fashion - the handlebar mustache
may very well never grace the pages
of Vogue as one of the season's high
fashions. But if it does, the Mus-
taches for Michigan founders have
one unanimous sentiment: "God
help us."
Regardless of what fashion dic-
tates, we probably haven't seen the
last of the Michigan mustache.
In a postgame e-mail, Patterson
wrote howhe thoughtSaturday was
a success - for both Michigan foot-
ball and the supporting'staches.
"We had a solid mustached show-
ing," he wrote. "Our team won, and
definitively so. Does one have any-
thingto do with the other? Only our
mustaches know the answer to that
question."

OUT with the OLD eats
This summer wrought the end of several dining and wining mainstays. Happily, though, their locations didn't stay empty for long.
But do the replacements measure up?

Served their last meals
Bella Ciao
Tucked away on Liberty Street just west of Main Street, this bistro was
a staple date destination for 22 years. But Bella Ciao set its last candle-lit
table for two June 20, meaning the city's cooing couples will have to share
tortellini in the bigger, brighter Gratzi just down the street.

New grits on the block
Grange Kitchen and Bar
The Grange has an optimistic future because it has the market cornered
when it comes to the buzziest of liberal buzzwords: "eating local." Taking
over Bella Ciao's cozy space, this eatery offers a creative seasonal menu
in a tried and true atmosphere. A sustainable menu sounds good and will
likely lead to a sustainable restaurant concept, but we'll see how appetiz-
ing it is when it's stripped of fresh summer produce for winter.

YOUTUBE
VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
A mellifluous divorce
Ever since "Jill and Kevin's Big
Day," a comical video of the couple's
wedding procession set to the tune of
Chris Brown's "Forever," it seemed
the two were destined to spend their
lives together.
That's apparently not the case. Six
months later, the marriage has com-
busted - at least according to this
rendering by a different group.
The video, titled "Jill and Kevin's
Last Day," musically chronicles the
couple's divorce proceedings, with
"Forever" once again serving as the
background music.
Like its predecessor, the video's
appeal primarily centers around
the cast of characters ostentatiously
groovingnto the music as they proceed
down the aisle. First, two lawyers
in black sunglasses abruptly toss up
their legal briefs and start dancing.
They're followed by a parade of pro-
fessional men and women, including
two security guards and a judge, who
gyrate their hips and flail their arms
as the congregants clap along to the
beat of the song.
When Kevin suddenly emerges, he
makes his entrance with a series of
somersaults and back handsprings.
Jill eventually meets Kevin at the
front of the courtroom, and they have
to be restrained from brawling with
each other.

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
Obama's health care Hustle - Tonight, President
Obama will deliver a major address that he hopes
will persuade Congress and the public to support
an overhaul of the country's health-care system. In
homage to all the raucous town-hall meetings last
month, you should host one of your own. All you'll
need are bold-lettered placards, a roomful of boister-
ous drunks and a life-size cutout of Chuck Grassley.
Death panels recommended, but not required.
Throwing this party? Let us know. TheStatement@umich.edu
STUDY OF THE WEEK
Macho men are less likely to seek preventive care
Men who exhibit macho behavior and subscribe to similar ideas
about masculinity are less likely than other men to pursue preventive
health-care services, which could result in lower life expectancies,
according to a study by Kristen Springer of Rutgers University.
In the study, Springer and a colleague assessed data from the 2004
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which included 1,000 middle-aged
men. The researchers analyzed the participants' masculinity beliefs,
socioeconomic status and compliance with certain common health-
care procedures, including physical and prostate exams.
In order to determine macho beliefs, the researchers had the men
rate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements like, "It
bothers me when a man does something that I consider 'feminine."'
The researchers concluded that men with macho beliefs were 26
percent less likely than others to have had a physical exam in the past
year and 30 percent less likely to have received a prostate exam.

YOUR (d s)ORIENTATION
You might have thought you had the full campus tour, but you'd never hear
about these blemishes in the University's history from a tour guide.

A PIONEER IN EUGENICS
University Hospital
One of the University's darkest secrets is reserved for one of science's
darkest movements: the eugenics movement. Stemming from Darwinist
ideals of becoming better with evolution, the eugenics movement of the
mid-20th century made it its mission to keep the sick, disabled, mentally
ill or anyone else deemed inferior at the time (mostly minorities and
criminals) from reproducing.
The University was a major champion of the cause. The University
Hospital performed a large portion of the roughly 3,800 sterilizations
estimated to have been performed in Michigan. Victor Vaughan, a for-
mer Medical School dean and namesake of the School of Public Health's
building, was one of the main advocates of Michigan's forced steriliza-
tion law. And former University President Clarence Cook Little, another
outspoken eugenics supporter, led the American Eugenics Society after
resigning from the University presidency in 1929.

FUELING THE WAR MACHINE
West Hall
Once home to the College of Engineering, West Hall was also the focal point of the Uni-
versity's much-maligned foray into military research.
A major recipient of Defense Department funding during World War II, the University pro-
vided a lot of the intellectual heft behind the nation's expanding war machine. Like the war,
that was a celebrated partnership.
By the 1960s, the University had moved its war research from West Hall to a facility in
Ypsilanti, but the classified military research continued. In 1969, for example, almost 43
percent of the University's research spending went to defense projects. Almost as significant,
the University was a hotbed for the expanding the military-related industry's recruiting
efforts.
Dow Chemical - a long-time, high-profile donor to the University and manufacturer of
napalm - recruited most of its best talent from the University.
The relationships with both the Defense Department (which was run during much of the
war by Ann Arborite Robert McNamara) and private industry left the University with blood
on its hands during the unpopular Vietnam War. It also led to a recommendation by the Uni-
versity's Research Policies Committee to ban classified research on campus and disavow any
projects that would lead to human destruction.
THE UNION TOWER OCCUPATION
Michigan Union
A controversial honor society with a racist past, an activist group
willingto go to extremes to make a point and a campus heated with
racial tensions due to the affirmative action debate - the showdown
on the seventh floor of the Michigan Union in 2000 had all the mak-
ings of a prolonged drama.
And that's exactly what it was. For 37 days, the Students of Color
Coalition occupied the seventh floor of the Union to protest the
sometimes-secret senior honor society Michigamua, once known
for rituals mocking Native Americans. To embarrass the group and
portray it as still culturally insensitive, the SCC gave guided tours of
the room, which was painted likea Native American wigwam, and
showed off a collection of Native American artifacts found in the
room. The honor society countered that it didn't even know about
the artifacts, which it said were stored in an attic and never used.
Despite pleas for a resolution from then-University President LeeT
Bollinger and several other University officials, the conflict contin-
ued until Michigamua abandoned its rights to the space and released
the artifacts.
Six years later, Michigamua abandoned its infamous name,
renaming itself Order of Angell a year later in an effort to move past
a controversial history that included the 2000 occupation.'

THE DEAN OF WOMEN'S REIGN
Student Activities Building
Keeping tabs on their female students was a major function of colleges in the
mid-20th century. The University of Michigan was no exception. It stood out,
though, by holding on to the practice a little longer and with a much greater inten-
sity than most.
As late as the 1960s, after manyschools had abolished dress codes, curfews and
dating restrictions for female students, the University's then-Dean of Women
Deborah Bacon continued to justify them under the principle of in loco parentis
- a theory that universities take on the moral responsibilities of a parent for their
students. And the restrictions on female students continued. With a network of
residence hall spies, Bacon kept records on female students' behavior so she could
inform parents about such things as interracial dating and even pass on infqrma-
tion to authorities like the FBI.
In 1961 the Dean of Women came tumbling down. Citing her disconnect from
the changingctimes, Bacon stepped down and her position dissolved behind her.
But as quoted by the Daily in 1959, she left female students with a lasting lesson:
"If a woman is so stupid she is unaware of marriage as one of the goals of a female
student, she is probably notsmart enough tobe admitted to our freshman class."
