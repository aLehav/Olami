Prospective 
University 
of 

Michigan student David Chu was 

looking forward to touring the 

University’s campus for his first 

time before making a college 

decision — until the coronavirus 

outbreak changed his plans.

Chu is from a suburb near 

Chicago, 
Illinois, 
and 
was 

accepted to the Ross School of 

Business. 
Because 
of 
campus 

event closures due to the COVID-

19 pandemic, however, he was 

unable to visit the University, 

which made his decision on which 

college to attend more difficult.

“There are a lot of schools that 

I applied to that I wasn’t really 

sure, and even now, there are a lot 

of schools that I feel like I need to 

visit in order to make my decision, 

and Michigan is one of them,” Chu 

said. “Not being able to visit the 

schools does make it harder for 

me to decide.”

The University canceled all 

in-person 
admissions 
events 

and is no longer conducting 

tours during the pandemic. The 

University’s 
admissions 
staff 

remains fully available by phone 

and email.

Betsy 
Brown, 
director 

of 
integrated 
marketing 

communications at the Office of 

Enrollment Management, wrote 

in an email to The Daily that 

students should remain in contact 

with the University despite the 

distance.

“We do want prospective and 

admitted students to stay in touch 

with us,” Brown wrote. “In many 

cases our admissions counselors 

are reaching out individually 

to students to address any of 

their questions or concerns. We 

also remain virtually open and 

available if students want to 

contact us.”

 Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Gary 

Peters, D-Mich., held the first of 

two telephone town halls on the 

COVID-19 pandemic open to the 

public.

On the call, Peters discussed 

Michigan’s 
expansion 
of 

unemployment 
benefits, 
ways 

residents 
can 
help 
health 

care workers access personal 

protective equipment, plans to 

minimize the pandemic’s impact 

on the economy and the direction 

of future legislative efforts.

Michigan Medicine preps for virus peak

Indoor track facility on State Street to be made into field hospital to cope with influx of patients

Michigan Medicine presented 

projections 
on 
how 
social 

distancing will impact the number 

of patients hospitalized for COVID-

19 at its peak and noted plans to 

convert an indoor track facility 

into a field hospital during a virtual 

press 
conference 
on 
Tuesday 

afternoon.

Vikas Parekh, associate chief 

for 
Medical, 
Emergency 
and 

Psychiatry Services at Michigan 

Medicine, said social distancing 

has beneficial long-term effects on 

the number of infected people. 

“The 
number 
of 
Michigan 

residents that will be infected with 

COVID-19 is likely to get worse 

before it gets better,” Parekh said. 

“There’s a high risk that it will 

overload our health care system. 

But this doesn’t mean that social 

distancing isn’t working — it just 

means we need to give it time to 

have impact.”

Keith 
Dickey, 
chief 
strategy 

officer for Michigan Medicine, 

said they expect to reach capacity 

at their hospitals in the next two 

weeks. 

In order to account for this surge 

in patients, Dickey said they are 

looking to create field hospitals. He 

noted this would be a “Step Down 

Unit” for patients who are generally 

stable but cannot return home. 

“We are now assessing locations 

outside of the four walls of our 

hospitals, on our athletic campus, 

for the potential to create a field 

hospital of 500 beds or more,” 

Dickey said. “The initial location 

we are evaluating and prepping for 

is in the indoor track at the facility 

on State Street.”

Dickey said they are aiming to 

have an initial field hospital up by 

April 9 or 10. 

Parekh 
noted 
the 
data 
and 

projections presented are based on 

worst-case scenario models where 

the most people possible become 

infected. 

The first model demonstrated 

that 
with 
“aggressive 
social 

distancing,” the peak would be on 

May 16 with 3,179 hospitalized, 

compared to a peak of 5,860 

hospitalized on May 4 with less 

social distancing.

“I’d like to, first and foremost, 

recognize the heroes in our state,” Peters 

said. “What we have seen from our fellow 

Michiganders has been nothing short of 

remarkable.” 

Peters thanked the health care and 

grocery store workers in their efforts to 

maintain essential services. The senator 

addressed COVID-19 as both a public 

health crisis and an economic crisis. 

Peters elaborated on his efforts 

through communicating with the Federal 

Emergency Management Agency to 

ensure as much equipment as possible is 

coming into the state. Additionally, a large 

portion of the $2 trillion stimulus package 

passed in Washington, D.C. is slated to go 

toward health care systems around the 

country.

Peters provided information about 

the state’s expansion of unemployment 

benefits to keep individuals and families 

protected while the economy has been put 

on pause. The Pandemic Unemployment 

Assistance, part of the CARES Act, is a 

part of the stimulus package which Peters 

worked on. This expands unemployment 

eligibility generally, including to small 

business owners who have had to close 

down during the crisis. 

On the state level, Peters explained 

the significant changes being made 

for Michiganders currently receiving 

unemployment benefits, including the 

influx of applicants coming in as the 

pandemic continues. Those currently 

receiving unemployment assistance will 

be eligible to receive an additional $600 

per week through July 2020 from the 

federal government. New applicants will 

receive this bonus as well.

Peters stressed the importance of 

supporting individuals and small business 

owners in order to make restarting the 

economy as painless as possible. 

“We’re taking measures similar to what 

is done during a natural disaster,” Peters 

said. “A pandemic is every bit a natural 

disaster as a hurricane, but this time it is 

blowing over the whole country, not just 

one region.” 

The call was later opened to questions 

from Michigan residents. One man from 

Clinton Township asked the senator what 

areas he thinks future bills will focus on. 

Peters said he wants to monitor what 

has already been passed and evaluate 

where additional resources would be 

necessary. However, Peters said some 

sort of assistance will be necessary for 

rural hospitals as well as educational 

institutions in the state as the number of 

COVID-19 patients rises. 

Another resident from Burton asked 

if the virus would delay the November 

election. Peters said every effort would 

be made to make sure voting continues as 

planned and he imagines voting would be 

made possible for all Michiganders from 

home through absentee ballots. 

The call ended as one resident from 

Shelby Township asked about communal 

efforts to help provide personal protective 

equipment to health care workers. 

“I know a lot of us have sewing 

machines and 3D printers we are ready 

to use,” Justin said. “Are there any 

existing programs out there currently 

organizing efforts for people to help make 

and distribute PPE (personal protective 

equipment)?” 

Peters acknowledged the numerous 

high school robotics teams using their 

skills to make masks as well as the role of 

Michigan auto companies in producing 

ventilators. 
He 
said 
the 
Michigan 

Economic 
Development 
Corporation 

is working to organize people who will 

be able to help supply more personal 

protective equipment in the short-run. 

“Eventually, the manufacturing muscle 

of this economy will be able to work 

faster,” Peters said. “But it takes time.”

The University of Michigan Central 

Student Government’s 10th Assembly 

was sworn in over BlueJeans by third 

year Law student Henry Zurn Tuesday 

night. The meeting was the first for 

the 
candidates 
for 
executive 
and 

representative positions elected in last 

week’s online voting.

Public Policy junior Amanda Kaplan 

and LSA junior Sav Nandigama, the 

new president and vice president, spoke 

about their vision for CSG in the next 

year after being sworn into their roles. 

Kaplan and Nandigama called for the 

newly elected Assembly members to 

set aside party differences and unite to 

serve the student body. 

“Parties are a great mechanism as far 

as providing some equity in the process 

and helping us achieve the goal of being 

elected, but at the end of the day, they’re 

not useful in the Assembly, because they 

get in the way of our individual decision-

making,” Nandigama said. “We should 

never use parties as the deciding factor in 

how we vote or what we vote for, because 

that’s not what we were elected to do.” 

Kaplan 
introduced 
motions 
to 

reallocate funds the Ninth Assembly 

promised to both student organizations 

and the Dean of Students’ Emergency 

Fund. The money allocated to the Office 

of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs and the 

Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness 

Center from CSG’s account was not 

taken out before remaining funds were 

allocated to support students during the 

COVID-19 outbreak. Kaplan said these 

motions would ensure the funds CSG had 

promised were properly allocated.

“When COVID-19 happened, the 

previous president allocated all the 

money in the executive discretionary 

account to the Dean of Students’ 

Emergency Fund and forgot that we had 

previously allocated certain amounts of 

money to different student organizations, 

and those transactions never got made,” 

Kaplan said. “This is money that we owe 

to people that we can’t take out of the 

Dean of Students’ Fund because that’s 

unfair to students who are currently 

using that money.”

Brown also detailed how the 

University is in the process of 

developing 
virtual 
resources 

for prospective students, which 

include a video narration of the 

information session, Campus Day 

presentations, 
alumni 
videos, 

social media interactions and 

a 360-degree video tour of the 

campus. 

“We 
have 
a 
number 
of 

opportunities 
in 
the 
works 

for prospective and admitted 

students to access information,” 

Brown 
wrote. 
“One 
exciting 

resource that we’ve been working 

closely with Michigan Creative 

on is a 360 video tour of campus. 

We’ve done a lot of videotaping 

already in collaboration with 

our 
campus 
partners, 
but 

unfortunately, 
that 
work 
is 

stalled for the moment. We’ll get 

back to it just as soon as students 

and faculty are back on campus.”

Due to the stalled production, 

Brown 
said 
the 
360-degree 

campus tour will not be available 

for current high school seniors, 

but rather future prospective 

students, 
faculty 
and 
staff 

looking to get a sense of the 

University’s community.

Brown also said the University 

will proceed as normal with the 

enrollment 
deposit 
deadline 

on May 1, while allowing those 

with extenuating circumstances 

to request extensions. Some 

universities across the country 

have begun to move the deposit 

deadline 
to 
June 
1, 
giving 

students 
additional 
time 
to 

commit.

Options for summer events 

are 
still 
being 
discussed, 

and 
notifications 
of 
any 

cancellations will be sent out at 

least a month in advance, Brown 

said. 

LSA senior David Dorsky has 

been a Campus Day leader for 

four years and a tour guide for 

three years. He said touring the 

University allows prospective 

and 
incoming 
students 
to 

experience college life among 

other students.

“A lot of people make their 

decisions off of how it feels to 

actually be on campus amongst 

these students,” Dorsky said. 

“You can read about it so much 

in a brochure and watch videos 

about the University, but to 

actually be on campus is just 

a whole other feeling that 

really gives you a sense of the 

University and the culture and 

the vibe here for prospective 

students.”

Prospective 
LSA 
student 

Stella McCabe-Soares is from 

New York City and said she 

was able to tour some schools 

near her home, but due to the 

distance, she was planning on 

touring the University after she 

was accepted.

“I 
definitely 
would 
have 

wanted to do a tour,” McCabe-

Soares said. “I think touring 

is valuable. Although it’s not 

the most accurate way to see 

if you would like the school or 

anything, it’s nice to go there 

because you could be living 

there.”

Faith 
Richardson, 
an 

incoming Ross student, is from 

Berrien Springs, Mich, and was 

able to visit the campus before 

classes were moved to remote 

learning. She said how the 

University has responded to the 

coronavirus outbreak is also a 

factor she is keeping in mind 

while making her decision.

Michigan 
Medicine 
is 

currently licensed for 1,000 

beds, according to a press 

release. 
Aggressive 
social 

distancing could reduce the 

number of hospitalized COVID-

19 patients by 65 percent. 

Parekh 
explained 
social 

distancing works because it 

slows 
down 
what’s 
known 

as “doubling time.” He said 

Michigan’s doubling time right 

now is three days — meaning 

the number of cases doubles 

every three days. The second 

model shown depicts how social 

distancing 
can 
significantly 

increase doubling time. 

At 
50 
percent 
social 

distancing, the doubling time 

is 
approximately 
7.7 
days, 

according to the chart.

During a Q&A session, Parekh 

said these percentages could 

generally apply to hospitals 

all around the country, but 

the individual numbers would 

differ.

Marschall Runge, executive 

vice 
president 
for 
medical 

affairs 
and 
chief 
executive 

officer of Michigan Medicine, 

said in the press release that 

Michigan Medicine is doing 

all they can to prepare, but he 

noted the importance of social 

distancing as demonstrated by 

the projections.

“I want to reassure the public 

that we are doing all we can 

to prepare to care for COVID-

19 positive patients as well as 

other patients who urgently 

require the highly-specialized, 

safe 
and 
reliable 
advanced 

medical care that Michigan 

Medicine 
delivers,” 
Runge 

said. “We have reached out for 

donations of medical equipment 

and 
received 
thousands 
of 

gloves, masks and more so we 

can better meet this challenge. 

We 
prepare 
constantly 
for 

emergencies like this and have 

some of the world’s top experts 

preparing for the problem. But 

we need your help, and these 

projections prove it.”

Parekh said they currently 

have 
enough 
personal 

protective 
equipment 
for 

Michigan Medicine staff but are 

testing ways to safely sanitize 

and reuse PPE if it becomes 

necessary. 

“The short answer is yes, 

right now we do feel that we 

have 
enough 
PPE,” 
Parekh 

said. “We have a robust system 

in place to track how much 

we use each day and what 

our inventory is. We are also 

taking aggressive measures to 

conserve and potentially reuse 

PPE when safe and effective.”

Parekh concluded by asking 

everyone 
to 
practice 
social 

distancing in order to reduce 

transmissions and stay healthy. 

“We want to reinforce our 

key takeaway messages here: 

the biggest takeaway is social 

distancing,” Parekh said. “So 

for everyone to do their part, 

stay at home, minimize contact 

with others, to not leave your 

home unless absolutely needed 

and obviously, at home and 

wherever you go — practice 

good 
hand-washing 
and 

maintain six feet of distance 

from others.”

HOSPITAL
From Page 1A

The University of Michigan 

is mostly vacant now that the 

majority of students have gone 

home due to the push from 

University Housing to leave 

campus. Two weeks ago, local 

police were notified of an 

armed person in a home on the 

400 block of North State Street 

in Ann Arbor. The situation 

was resolved as the suspect was 

taken into custody. 

Despite the armed person 

incident, Melissa Overton, chief 

of the Division of Public Safety 

and Security, said she does not 

expect the decreased number 

of people to result in increased 

crime or looting. 

For one, Overton said the 

number of workers who remain 

at the University, such as those 

working at Michigan Medicine 

along with other essential staff, 

is no different than during 

University breaks. 

“The vacant campus gives us 

the opportunity to get in the 

buildings more frequently, and 

if there are people who aren’t 

supposed to be around we get 

more calls as well,” Overton 

said. “We don’t expect any 

influx of crime at all, and the 

quiet makes it easier for us to 

know who belongs and who 

doesn’t.”

Sergeant Corey Mills, who 

is in charge of the community 

engagement unit for the Ann 

Arbor Police Department, also 

said calls for service have gone 

down. He said assault numbers, 

which include both simple and 

domestic assaults, have not 

changed and may have even 

decreased.

“We attribute the decrease 

in calls from not many people 

being on the road, which lessens 

traffic crashes as well as minor 

offenses such as trespassing,” 

Mills said. “To be expected, 

we’re 
not 
getting 
many 

property claims either, simply 

because larceny and breaking 

into homes can’t happen when 

everyone is home and overall, 

general calls for service have 

been lowered.” 

Similarly, some students who 

chose to remain on campus, 

such as Taubman sophomore 

Madhumita Krishnan said she 

feels safer as Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer’s Stay Home, Stay 

Safe Executive Order and other 

Centers for Disease Control and 

Prevention 
guidelines 
about 

coronavirus influences her to 

stay inside more. Because her 

apartment has proper security 

systems, 
Krishnan 
said 
she 

doesn’t feel any more in danger 

than before. 

Additionally, 
Krishnan 

said she thinks most empty 

apartments do not have what 

potential looters might want to 

take.

“At this point, I don’t think 

that 
stealing 
things 
like 

furniture 
or 
electronics 
is 

useful because people aren’t out 

to buy it right now,” Krishnan 

said. “I’d think they’d want 

food, and because many people 

cleared out their apartments, 

and there’s probably no food, 

there’s nothing for them to 

steal.” 

Business senior Gabrielle de 

Coster said she hasn’t noticed a 

difference in crime levels due to 

social distancing, as she spends 

her time either walking in 

Nichols Arboretum or isolating 

herself in her apartment. De 

Coster said she believes staying 

indoors by herself helps keep 

her safe from possible crime in 

the area. 

“Honestly if it weren’t for 

the emergency alert on my 

phone, I would have had no 

idea about the (armed person) 

because I was fully quarantined 

waiting for my tests results 

for COVID-19,” de Coster said. 

“I also live over by Tappan 

and Hill, so it doesn’t feel as 

desolate or more dangerous 

in comparison to areas with 

mostly undergraduate students, 

such as White Street.” 

Even though the incident with 

the armed individual happened 

just a block from where he 

lives, Engineering junior Sahil 

Saini said he feels safe. He said 

he has been taught to be well-

prepared for any circumstances 

of looting or crime and doesn’t 

feel there is a need to move off-

campus. 

“I mean this is the stuff I 

grew up with, but everything in 

my car is in my trunk, because I 

have a trunk cover, and even if I 

need to leave stuff in my car, it 

goes under a blanket or inside a 

bag or hidden somewhere,” Saini 

said. “I check the front door a 

couple times a day because I’m 

living with subletters now as 

all my roommates moved out, 

but I can honestly say I would 

walk around Kerrytown with 

my laptop and feel safe.” 

According to Overton, in any 

case of possible crime, DPSS 

covers security for housing, the 

museums and the hospital. She 

said everyone is working hard 

to ensure those who remain on 

campus are safe. 

She also urged community 

members to take precautions 

for their own safety as well. 

“Be 
aware 
of 
your 

surroundings, and make sure 

to lock your doors if you’re the 

only ones working in the office,” 

Overton said. “And make sure 

to call if you see anybody who 

doesn’t belong in the area.” 

Mills said everyone in the city 

should abide by the governor’s 

orders to stay home, including 

students.

“Students often want to still 

congregate in four or five groups 

of people, and we’ve caught a 

couple kids playing beer pong 

and we have to remind them 

they are in violation ... in order 

to stop the spread and flatten 

the curve out,” Mills said. “To 

my knowledge, we have not 

issued any violations, but we 

have had to give out warnings 

and have ordered people to go

M

arch 10 is a day I 

won’t soon forget. 

Classes 
had 
yet 

to be moved online, and I was 

clinging to the hope that I would 

get to finish my freshman year 

in Ann Arbor. Yet, that day, the 

coronavirus was not on my mind 

— voting was. It was primary day 

in Michigan and, like countless 

other students, I went to the 

polls and cast my vote, proudly 

sporting my sticker afterward. 

We were fortunate to have our 

election that day, as that very 

night Michigan was put under a 

state of emergency.

However, many other states 

were not as lucky. As the threat 

of COVID-19 forces millions 

of Americans to stay home and 

practice social distancing, many 

states have postponed their 

presidential primaries. Given 

that we do not know how long 

the outbreak will last, there 

are many lingering questions 

about whether voting in this 

critical election year can take 

place as it normally does. One 

option being explored is voting 

by mail, a unique system that 

should be considered not only 

during this crisis but as a 

possible permanent step toward 

more accessible and equitable 

voting in the future. 

Although it has gained more 

attention due to coronavirus, 

voting by mail is not a new 

concept. Five states — Colorado, 

Hawaii, 
Oregon, 
Utah 
and 

Washington — virtually hold all 

their elections solely through 

the mail. In each state, a ballot 

is mailed to the address of every 

registered 
voter. 
The 
voter 

can then fill out their ballot 

and mail it in or drop it off at 

a certain location. While this 

system might sound strange to 

those of us who have only voted 

in person, the “vote by mail” 

system has benefits.

One of the most tangible 

benefits is an increase in voter 

turnout. Voter turnout in this 

country is abysmal. One of the 

contributing factors to these 

low turnout numbers is the 

inaccessibility of the polls for 

many people. Many places have 

chronic issues of long lines, 

with one man waiting almost 

seven hours just to vote in 

the Texas primary. Even with 

shorter wait times, getting to 

the polls can still be difficult 

for people. Not every person 

can find time on a Tuesday to 

go to the polls and cast their 

vote. This is especially true for 

those working hourly jobs. I was 

extremely privileged to have an 

accessible polling place minutes 

from my dorm and to have the 

time needed to cast my vote. 

The fact that the ballot box is 

not as accessible to others is 

unacceptable and is why we 

must reform our system. 

Voting by mail addresses 

these issues by allowing people 

to fill out and return their 

ballot when it is convenient 

for them. The impact of voting 

by mail on turnout can be seen 

in Washington, Colorado and 

Oregon: All these states had 

2016 voter turnout levels over 

the national average of 60.2 

percent.

Voting by mail also allows 

people the time to think about 

who they want to vote for. 

Many people are not aware of 

every race on the ballot and 

may find themselves unsure of 

who to vote for when they get 

to the polls. Voting by mail helps 

solve this problem by allowing 

voters the time to research the 

candidates and mull over their 

options before deciding. I was 

reminded of this fact this past 

week while voting online for the 

University of Michigan Central 

Student Government election. 

Having access to my ballot for 48 

hours allowed for me to research 

the CSG candidates, many of 

whom I did not know about 

previously. 

Some may worry about the 

issue of voter fraud with non-in-

person voting. Firstly, voter fraud 

is not the widespread systemic 

issue that some politicians want 

you to believe it is. Studies have 

shown that the overall rate of 

voter fraud is negligible. In many 

ways, mail-in voting is safer 

than in-person voting. Yes, it is 

possible that some people could 

submit a ballot that does not 

belong to them; however, in doing 

so they would be committing a 

crime and risking jail time. It is 

doubtful that many people would 

take this risk, therefore making 

fraud in the “vote by mail” 

states unlikely. 

Voting by mail is safer than 

other types of voting because 

instead of machines that can 

break or that are potentially 

vulnerable to hackers, everything 

is done on paper. Paper cannot 

be hacked and leaves a trail that 

makes it easy for discrepancies 

to be addressed, ensuring the 

integrity of the voting results.

As a pragmatist, I realize 

that it is unlikely that even a 

pandemic will make us overhaul 

our entire voting system. Many 

people love casting their ballot 

in person and getting their 

stickers and are not ready to 

give that up. That is why we 

should look for a middle ground 

in regards to voting by mail by 

expanding the use of no-excuse 

absentee ballots. 

No-excuse absentee ballots 

allow for any voter to vote via 

absentee ballot without having 

to provide an excuse if they 

can’t or don’t want to go to the 

polls on election day. In 2018, 

through Proposal 3, Michigan 

implemented this system, which 

has made voting more accessible. 

We saw a huge increase in the 

number of absentee ballots cast 

by mail in the March 10 primary 

— a true testament to what 

happens when voting becomes 

more accessible.

Our current voting system 

is simply not working for the 

majority of citizens. Too many 

Americans do not or cannot cast 

their votes. Voting by mail is 

one of our greatest resources to 

help try to solve this problem. 

By allowing people to submit 

their votes through the mail we 

can increase civic participation 

in this country and give voters 

the time to carefully consider 

who they vote for. Although the 

coronavirus has brought the issue 

of voting by mail to the forefront, 

I hope it is viewed as a long-

term solution with the potential 

to 
be 
implemented 
beyond 

this election cycle. Whether 

it 
is 
instituting 
no-excuse 

absentee voting in every state or 

transitioning toward the highly 

successful systems in place in 

fully vote-by-mail states, these 

changes can help enfranchise 

more people.

E

very time I open my closet, I 

glance up, look at my neatly hung 

cap and gown and look away 

in disappointment. The memories I had 

hoped to make wearing that outfit are 

only a dream now. There was something 

so deliriously exciting about buying that 

graduation attire — I remember it so clearly. 

But now, even looking at it makes me sigh. 

It’s been two and a half weeks since 

we seniors were told that not only are 

our last undergraduate classes turned 

remote, but our celebratory ceremony is 

canceled. Amid a climate of tension and 

the unknown, I have had to quickly say 

goodbye to my undergraduate career, 

scramble to give my last hugs and continue 

with my academics as if a huge rug hasn’t 

just been pulled out from under me. 

A college graduation ceremony is a rite of 

passage, an incredibly symbolic honor and 

a much-anticipated event. I now walk past a 

bleak and empty Law Quadrangle, wishing 

so desperately I had gotten my senior pictures 

taken earlier. I walk past my academic buildings 

where I had spent so many grudging moments 

— only to wish I had appreciated it more. I 

found out the news that in-person classes were 

canceled after having stepped out of my last 

one. I immediately wanted desperately to go 

back and enjoy that experience one more time. 

There are a myriad of memories and 

experiences that are now unable to occur, 

an entire bucket list gone unchecked. 

With a reminder to be grateful for these 

past four years, I comfort myself with the 

opportunities I’ve been presented with at 

this university, the friends I’ve made and the 

knowledge I’ve gained. There is truly never 

a time that can echo this experience, and for 

me and thousands of others to be ripped from 

that closure is disheartening to say the least. 

I have been told repeatedly to look 

beyond this, beyond my own pain and see 

the world’s suffering. And while I am just 

as anxious for this trying time to pass for 

all of us, I would like to take a moment to 

grieve the loss of my graduation and all the 

memories that come with it. It is alright 

to feel heavy and disconcerted, but all the 

while reminding ourselves how lucky we 

truly are to have an experience so beautiful, 

which makes it hard to step away.

To 
all 
my 
fellow 
graduates, 
I 

congratulate you, I mourn with you and I 

celebrate you. Forever, Go Blue!

Let’s vote by mail now and in the future

G

lobal society is going through 

a rather confusing, and even 

depressing, time given the recent 

outbreak of COVID-19. Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer recently issued a stay-at-home 

order for all residents of Michigan, and the 

University of Michigan has been strongly 

encouraging students to leave Ann Arbor 

to return to their homes. Self-quarantine 

has become an everyday vocabulary word. 

Not many of us have been through anything 

remotely close to what is currently happening 

in our lives and as we all try to understand and 

adapt to these circumstances, social media 

culture has been surprisingly helpful. TikTok 

and Instagram in particular are promoting 

self-quarantine in the most lighthearted — 

and therefore perhaps appropriate — way 

possible, and at least people are finding some 

entertainment while maintaining social 

distance. This trend of social media bringing 

people together in a virtual way is certainly 

worth our attention. 

TikTok is one of the fastest growing social 

media platforms to date, with more than 1.5 

billion downloads worldwide. The Chinese 

video-sharing social media application is 

dominating the market and continuing to 

sweep the Generation-Z population globally 

off their feet with its unique filters and 

effects. As the pandemic stopped people 

from meeting their friends or reporting to 

work, TikTokers worldwide took advantage 

of this and started to create more content at 

home. There are more than 7 billion views on 

TikTok videos with “#quarantine” and the 

numbers are only expected to grow as the 

virus spreads.

Most of such videos capture moments in 

the creators’ lives of self-quarantine and are 

aimed to be funny. Some videos poke fun 

at the online class format most universities 

have adopted; in one, a student presents a 

Barbie doll instead of their face as a form of 

attendance, while another has a computer 

graphic aurora in the background to make it 

look like he is in Antarctica. Another about 

a family enjoying creative dinners from one 

of their children also received millions of 

likes. More content like this is giving people 

who are actively practicing self-isolation 

something to laugh about in their now 

relatively less eventful lives. 

On the other hand, there are some TikToks 

that send a rather serious message. People 

from areas struck the hardest by the virus, 

including Wuhan, China and various parts 

of Italy, created videos to let the rest of the 

world know how those areas were surviving 

and raised alarm to those who might not be 

taking the pandemic seriously enough.

Instagram is a more familiar social media 

platform for many adults. Ever since the 

importance of self-quarantine had been 

emphasized by public health authorities 

like the Centers for Disease Control and 

Prevention, Instagram has put forth a 

new trend of its own called “Stay Home.” 

Influencers and athletes with millions of 

followers started creating new at-home 

challenges, such as doing as many pushups as 

possible in one story. 

A good friend of mine from U-M’s club 

soccer team tagged me in a challenge to 

juggle a roll of toilet paper as if it were a soccer 

ball. These challenges might seem easy and 

simple, but as I tried multiple times to make 

the best “TP juggling” video, I soon realized 

it was one of the best workouts I had done for 

the past two weeks. I never went regularly 

to the gym during the semester but I love 

playing soccer and I tried my best to play for 

at least a couple of hours every week until 

the self-quarantine. Being on the verge of 

sweating for the first time in weeks trying to 

perfect the challenge reminded me how it felt 

to stay active. An Instagram challenge, which 

some might view as pointless, made me think 

about ways to not only stay safe but also stay 

healthy. It was also a good way to connect 

with some of my friends because I got to 

nominate the next five users to continue with 

the challenge. I never thought I would enjoy 

recording myself juggling toilet paper and 

posting it for the world to see, but I did. 

TikTok was created in China and 

Instagram is one of the most used apps 

worldwide. Though I have been exposed to 

mostly U.S.-made content, I think it is fair to 

assume that this trend is widespread across 

the entire world. Looking at people having, or 

at least trying to have, some fun during such 

confusing times was mesmerizing. Social 

media and its culture are not only effectively 

promoting 
self-quarantine 
through 

informative short videos and simple workout 

challenges, but also keeping us mentally alive 

with something to laugh about and friends to 

talk to — at least through our phones.

Social media culture to the rescue?

MUSIC REVIEW

There’s a point in everyone’s life when they 

suddenly become an oldhead. Well, the act of 

becoming an oldhead isn’t sudden. It’s a years — even 

decades — long process, and its onset can be quite 

jarring. Say that in your younger days, you enjoyed 

1990s and 2000s hip-hop a la 50 Cent, Notorious 

B.I.G., Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and Kanye 

West, but now in 2020, you find yourself repulsed 

by new schoolers like Lil Uzi Vert, YoungBoy Never 

Broke Again, Trippie Redd and Travis Scott. You 

only identify with new school revivalists like Dababy 

and YBN Cordae (BLEGH!), and you’re dying 

for another rapper like Kendrick Lamar (or even 

Kendrick himself) to show face. You might hate the 

new school’s maximalist, booming beats, but you 

hate their muddled and mumbled deliveries even 

more. You may even begin to find yourself looking 

forward to nice home-cooked breakfasts, waking up 

for blunted Sunday morning television sessions, and 

enjoying some good, old-fashioned peace and quiet. 

That’s when you know you’ve become an oldhead. 

It’s not a bad thing! It sucks, but at some point, 

everyone will metamorphose into the proverbial 

old man. This doesn’t mean you have to be a sour 

and jaded curmudgeon, though. The secret to 

gracefully becoming an oldhead is respecting, or 

even admiring, the sonic innovation of the new 

school even if you don’t necessarily enjoy it. Just take 

it all in stride and give it an honest try, like resident 

oldhead Glen Boothe.

You see, Glen Boothe, better known as 

Knxwledge, is only 32 years old, but you wouldn’t 

guess it from his throwback beats. He’s a student 

of J Dilla and Madlib that crafts dusty yet highly 

nuanced loops using samples ripped from YouTube. 

He’s more than just a revivalist, though. In his 

mixtape series Wraptaypes, he lifts vocal samples 

from popular rap songs, processes and distorts them, 

then overlays the samples onto his beats to fuse the 

old school and the new school (these hastily-made 

remixes often have surprisingly good results, just 

listen to this charming rendition of Drake’s “God’s 

Plan”). He’s truly a master of what he does, expertly 

and deftly placing every drum kick and sample 

burst. Each beat is fresh, even when his source 

material is anything but. He isn’t some reclusive 

artist who releases every once in a blue moon, 

either. He’s prolific. In fact, he’s released a total of 

I-can’t-even-count-how-many albums since 2009. 

His work has even landed him some impressive 

placements. He’s featured prominently on Kendrick 

Lamar’s “Momma” and has collaborated with 

superstars like Anderson .Paak and underground 

headscratchers like Mach-Hommy, Roc Marciano 

and Tha God Fahim.

With friends like this, you’d expect his most 

recent major release to be a star-studded affair. 

Instead, Knxwledge places himself, a hermetic 

stoner with an affinity for Carhartt and sweatbands, 

at center stage on 1988, his follow-up to 2015’s 

outstanding Hud Dreems. He lets his off-kilter 

beats do the talking. He doesn’t need high-profile 

features to prove his talent to the world. All he needs 

is himself, and 1988 is proof of that. 

With only five of the 22 songs clocking in at 

over two minutes in length, 1988 is a brief affair, 

but it’s a deep one with plenty to dive into. Though 

the songs have few words, the tracklist itself tells 

a story and acts as a ciphered guide for listening. 

When decrypted, it roughly expresses: “Don’t be 

afraid because tomorrow’s not promised. Do you; 

that’s all we can do. Listen and learn how to cope 

with reality. You only get one, so live life. Be safe 

and watch who you call your homie; they come and 

they go. You don’t have to be gangsta all the time. 

Believe me, it can be so nice. Make use of the time. 

Make it live forever. A woman’s life is love. A man’s 

life is love. Keep on minding my business.” Each 

sentence is composed of one to three songs that 

are somehow related, whether it’s in the tone of the 

track or the style of the sample; they all culminate to 

form a reassuring, comforting collection of smudgy, 

crackling vignettes.

Each segment of the album is absolutely stunning, 

but 1998 is truly at its best when ingested in its 

entirety. That’s not to say there aren’t highlights. 

Early standout “Do You” is a bouncy yet subdued 

tromp featuring countless layers of twinkling 

pianos, 
shimmering 
chimes 
and 
oscillating 

synthesizers, with a concluding sample that 

proclaims, “You creative like a broke bitch, man. 

That’s what it is, bro,” as if Knxwledge knows that 

he just cooked up something special and is giving it 

his seal of approval. On “Be Safe,” he starts with a 

brilliantly implemented sample that says, “Word up, 

you know what I’m sayin. I ain’t frontin with nobody 

else. You know what, Smitty gave me the word, you 

know what I mean, I gotta let Knxwledge be heard” 

and then pushes into a gorgeous, reinvigorating 

instrumental driven by 

warped strings and a 

trunk-rattling 
bassline. 

He fills the track with the 

occasional “Yo, wassup?” 

or “What’s the deal, baby? 

It’s 
Knxwledge 
right 

here,” 
seemingly 
from 

Knxwledge himself. 1988 

is littered with little gems 

like these, and thanks to 

their fleeting runtimes, 

you’ll want to listen to them again and again. 

Despite how wonderful Knxwledge’s brief works 

are, he shines brightest on full-length tracks. Take 

“Itkanbe[Sonice],” for example. It is the only song 

with a big-name feature on it, and it still doesn’t break 

the two-minute mark, even though the featured 

artist is none other than Anderson .Paak. Despite 

the limited time, .Paak delivers a slick and boastful 

verse detailing his expensive lifestyle centered 

around the line “I don’t even know how it feels [to 

be broke] anymore.” Where “Itkanbe[Sonice]” is 

celebration of wealth, “Amanslifeislove_Keepon” is 

both a celebration of life and a reminder to stay true 

to yourself even when it’s difficult, delivered by an 

instrumental that would be right at home on a ’90s 

RnB album. Closing song “Minding_MyBusiness” 

ends 1988 with a pacifying message to listeners: 

“Why stress myself out about my life / My n*****, 

what for? / What good is 

it gon’ do me / Ignore the 

sunshine / I know it can 

get ugly but you can find 

the beauty in life.”

So yeah, Knxwledge is 

an oldhead, but that doesn’t 

mean that he resists the 

modern world. With 1988, 

he forged 22 outstanding 

beats and arranged them 

in such a way that the 

project as a whole is far greater than its already-

great pieces. The project proves that Knxwledge, 

despite his music’s throwback nature, can still be 

an innovator in the game’s ultra-modern landscape. 

Oldheads can still be on the cutting edge of music; 

they don’t have to be dismissive, heckling cranks. 

Knxwledge is proof of that.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Review: ‘Council of Dads’ My grandfather, out of coffee

JOSHUA THOMAS

Daily Arts Writer

ZOE PHILLIPS
Senior Arts Editor

On the surface, a council of dads isn’t a bad idea. 

Reconciling with his terminal diagnosis, loving 

father Scott Perry decides to form a council to 

guide and support his family after he’s gone. The 

series premiere serves as a prologue for the rest 

of the show. “Council of Dads” is a familial tear-

jerker in the same vein as “This is Us,” but where 

the latter succeeded in being a genuinely gripping 

emotional rollercoaster, 

the former can’t even get 

off the ground. What’s 

wrong with “Council of 

Dads” is precisely what 

works so well in “This 

is Us.” The characters. 

Namely, the characters 

in “Council of Dads” are 

just perfect, so perfect 

in fact, that they are 

unrelatable.

Take for example, Robin (Sarah Wayne 

Callies, “Prison Bream”), the matriarch of the 

family. She’s hardworking and self-reliant. Even 

at her husband Scott’s (Tom Everett Scott, “The 

Healing Powers of Dude”) funeral, she’s bossing 

people around. Her issue is, in the words of her 

husband, she “doesn’t know how to ask for help.” 

Even her flaws sound like strengths. Another 

example is Luly (Michelle Weaver, “Portals”), the 

narrator of the first episode. Her main conflict 

centers around dealing with her dad’s illness 

while engaging in a (boring) will-they-won’t-they 

relationship with her old crush (shocker: they do). 

At the end of the episode, just months after her 

father’s passing, she marries him. Any sort of 

tension which the episode painfully drew out was 

simply obliterated in the last few moments of the 

premiere. It also doesn’t help that the show itself 

is set in the absolutely gorgeous city of Savannah, 

Georgia, or that the family owns a picturesque 

beachfront home. Or that all the friends of the 

Perry’s are successful entrepreneurs or doctors. 

The world of “Council of Dads” and the people 

who live in it are perfect, but perfection isn’t 

relatable. 
Shoehorning 

a cancer diagnosis into 

a family isn’t going to do 

the dirty work of making 

them real people. The 

show 
creates 
these 

characters 
whose 

virtues 
are 
endless, 

whose flaws are too 

good to be true, whose 

dilemmas are resolved 

in an instant and then 

politely asks the audience to see themselves in 

these characters. By making these characters’ 

lives and virtues so lofty, it’s hard to see how 

anyone in the U.S. can honestly keep watching 

the show without hating themselves. Not only do 

the perfect characters make the show completely 

disengaging, it also begs the question: Where 

does the show go from here?

My grandfather has run out of coffee. Every 

morning, he mixes a blend of Colombian dark 

roast from Costco that he pours into a thermos 

to keep hot for the rest of the day. No milk, no 

cream and no sugar. Just coffee. He buys the 

grounds in three pound cans that will last 

him a few months, but right now he barely has 

enough for two more days. 

On March 17, the retirement community 

where he and my grandmother live locked 

its gates in response to the coronavirus 

pandemic. They cannot leave, and if they do 

they will not be allowed back in. Packages 

cannot be delivered and meals usually 

eaten in community spaces are dropped at 

residents’ doorsteps. Staff will take care of the 

grocery shopping. “They’ll shop tomorrow, 

or tomorrow afternoon,” my grandfather — I 

call him Granny — recently told me over the 

phone. “We turn our order in and I included 

coffee on that but it won’t be the kind of coffee 

that I like.” He paused. “But it’s coffee.” 

“Granny, how many years have you been 

drinking coffee?” I asked. He said it’s been 

since he was drafted to the Army. That was 

1956 — a lot of cups of coffee ago. 

But it wasn’t until the 90s, when he started 

visiting my parents across the country in 

California that Granny discovered dark roast. 

“People here just drink weak coffee. It’s all 

Folgers coffee.” My grandparents live in North 

Carolina. They both speak with graceful 

southern accents, and Granny’s voice hugs the 

“o” in “Folgers” as he describes his distaste 

for the brand: “I’d rather just have a glass of 

orange juice if I’m going to have weak coffee.” 
 

Regardless, my grandparents aren’t mad 

at the potential strong coffee shortage. They 

feel safe in their retirement community and 

respect the actions taken to protect them 

and their friends. The delivered meals and 

canceled game nights feel appropriate for the 

challenges at hand — both my grandparents 

are over 80 and neither of them can remember 

anything similar to COVID-19 in their 

lifetimes. 

This is what I had called them about. I can’t 

remember anything similar to coronavirus, 

but I also can’t remember 9/11, and I only 

have snippets of the 2008 economic crash. My 

database is limited — I thought Granny and 

Grandma might have something else to say. 

“The polio epidemic.” My grandparents 

jinxed each other, overlapping their words to 

answer my question. I figured they’d say that 

— Grandma recently told me a story about 

waving to her friend across the street during 

quarantine, unable to go out and play. The 

corner of my mouth had tipped into a smile; 

just last week I had also waved to a friend from 

across the street as we tried to maintain our 

friendship amid social distancing guidelines. 

Eighty years of distance between the same 

distancing behavior.

“The Authenticity Project” gets its title from a 

notebook a lonely old man leaves behind. As he searches 

for authenticity in a world full of lies, he begins by writing 

his own truth in the pages of a notebook. In return, he 

only asks for one thing: that the reader who finds the 

authenticity project writes their own truth. And maybe 

then we can be more honest with each other. 

“The Authenticity Project” is a successful attempt by 

Clare Pooley to show how isolated 

we all are. While we uniquely find 

ourselves physically isolated in real 

time, Clare Pooley brings to light 

that many of us hide behind facades: 

from our misleading social media 

personalities to our carefully conveyed 

daily dispositions. The characters 

Pooley dreams up emphasize the extent 

to which we are separated; however, 

with an enticing plot, Pooley shows just 

how easy it is for us to reconnect. 

Pooley uses a unique structure 

to introduce the characters. The 

authenticity project is first left behind 

by Julian Jessop, its creator, in a small 

cafe. Monica, the owner of the cafe, 

is the first to find the notebook and read Julian’s story. 

Following suit with the project, Monica writes her own 

truth before leaving it in another location. The man to pick 

it up becomes our third character, and so on. 

The unique structure allows for the profound 

immersion of each distinct character: Julian, the creator of 

the authenticity project, is a lonely but fierce artist whose 

persona lights up the pages; Monica, who first finds the 

authenticity project, is a strict but caring woman; Hazard, 

the proceeding reader, is a man whose name perfectly 

sums him up. The book moves on to include several 

other specific characters who appear to clash more than 

coincide.

However, as the characters read each other’s secret 

personal stories, they routinely find that they can relate. 

It was humanizing to see how such clearly different 

characters, each with different priorities and interests, 

could relate to each other, and even more humanizing to 

see the effort of each person to help the other out. 

In light of current events, it is easy to get lost in the chaos 

of news cycles and mandates and global statistics. Of course 

it is important to stay updated on the global pandemic, but 

it can be incredibly draining to read about it, let alone for 

those who are experiencing it in more intrusive ways. Yet, 

a glimmer of positivity has emerged 

from the pandemic in how strongly 

people — specifically strangers — 

have cared for one another: when an 

airline threw a mini-graduation for 

onboard seniors, when New Orleans 

quarterback Drew Brees donated $5 

million to Louisiana, and when little 

kids posting their drawings to their 

windows to spread joy. 

The willingness of strangers to help 

each other out is continuously explored 

within the novel: We see the characters 

go distances (some in a literal sense) 

to help one another. Most of the 

characters spilled their struggles and 

trauma onto the pages of the notebook, 

feeling that the cathartic process was comforting enough. 

Yet, as they go on their own missions to help previous 

writers, all fail to realize that someone is looking out for 

them, too.

Though I appreciated the book providing a distraction 

from our disorderly world, as the project touched 

more characters, I felt them becoming more and more 

stereotypical in contrast to the original people Pooley had 

introduced.

LILLY PEARCE
Daily Arts Writer

Farewell, 
our 
adopted 

Michiganders. Sudden virus has 

taken the Midwest, turned it 

upside down and shook the life out 

of it like an old piggy bank. Streets 

are empty. Human interaction has 

vanished from our lives. Memories 

of people hang like smoke in the 

room. Counting Crows once sang, 

“If dreams are like movies, then 

memories are films about ghosts.” 

The flat, gray expanse that is Ann 

Arbor is haunted by these ghosts. 

By you, by the Arborites holed up 

at home, by the gothic mythology 

woven into the fabric of this region.

The true horror of the Midwest is 

the excessive generalities applied to 

it. Midwesterns are not one people. 

Michiganders and Kansans are no 

more Protestant and hardworking 

than 
New 
Englanders 
or 

Southerners. It is not all cornfields 

and folk tradition. The cornfields 

hide no monster other than the 

rising suicide rate among farmers. 

The folk traditions mask nothing 

besides our industrial fallout and 

the sharp segregation of our cities. 

The Midwestern identity is not one 

identity, but rather the quiet and 

torturous struggle between these 

competing identities.

The western corners of the 

Midwest — Nebraska, the Dakotas, 

Kansas — know this pain. Take 

Prairie Madness: the deep isolation 

and 
torrential 
winds 
often 

caused prairie settlers to suffer, 

succumbing to depression, violence 

and even suicide. Some farmers still 

claim to hear voices in the fields. 

Similarly, the Midwest’s literary 

canon chronicles not the self-

sufficient do-gooder of popular 

consciousness, but the trauma of 

isolation.

Gene Wolfe’s “Peace” is one 

such 
example. 
Published 
in 

1975, the novel tells the story of 

Andrew Weer, an elderly man in a 

small Midwestern town, through 

scattered memories and dreams. 

The narrator’s memories are often 

nonlinear, transcending both time 

and the traditional bounds in 

which memories exist. While its 

patience may at first seem gentle, 

this novel is truly harrowing. 

Weer’s narration is contradictory 

and ambiguous. Scattered like 

breadcrumbs are hints of murder. 

It is a meditation on the danger of 

religiosity and the inevitability of 

sin. Perhaps most terrifying of all, 

Weer is likely dead, his narrative 

told by his ghost. But it is worth 

wondering 
whether 
he’s 
truly 

dead, or if he has always been a 

ghost — another Midwesterner 

floating through his conflicting, 

claustrophobic landscape.

“Universal Harvester” by John 

Darnielle is a novel with similar 

disturbances. This novel tells the 

story of a video store clerk in 1990s 

Iowa. When some video tapes come 

back with strange clips spliced into 

the tape, so begins an unusual and 

patient tale of obsession and terror, 

set against the backdrop of the 

isolating rural landscape. People 

might cry out for help in cornfields, 

“but nobody usually hears them. A 

few rows of corn will muffle the 

human voice so effectively that, 

even a few insignificant rows away, 

all is silence,” Darnielle writes. 

It is, at the same time, both a 

reflection of belonging and grief, 

and a realization that the true 

horror of life is scattered among 

the daily banalities. The narrative 

shifts, splits, mutates. The ghost 

and the narrative are one and the 

same.

While not Midwestern — it 

takes place in Dallas — I cannot 

help but return to the 2017 film, 

“A Ghost Story.” Starring Casey 

Affleck (“Manchester by the Sea”) 

and Rooney Mara (“The Girl with 

the Dragon Tattoo”), this film is 

heartbreaking, quiet and caustic. 

Affleck’s character passes away, 

but returns as a ghost, draped in 

a sheet like a child. He watches 

the life he knew — and his wife 

— slip away from him. Shots in 

this film are long, dragging like 

Affleck’s white sheet along the 

ground. But Affleck’s pain — one 

of confinement, of dormancy, of 

helplessness — feels pertinent and 

relatable for both the identity-

conflicted Midwestern and the 

quarantined 
alike. 
Affleck’s 

struggle to communicate and his 

longing for affection are poignant 

and understood best in this era of 

agonizing torpidity.

The world is quieter now, hollow 

and overcast. Like a decrepit 

house come nighttime, the ghosts 

have come out. But they were 

always here. The isolation, the 

claustrophobia, 
the 
loneliness. 

Once you exit the once-crowded 

Ann Arbor streets, everything 

goes flat. Pickup trucks sag rusty 

in fields. Gas station lights are the 

only evidence of life for miles. The 

cornfields are alive with whispers. 

For those of us left in the Midwest, 

we again become the ghosts from 

which we once hid, trapped with 

nowhere to run in our enforced 

confinement. We have all become, 

like the Midwest, full of ghosts. So 

have our memories.`

MUSIC REVIEW
5 Seconds of Summer grows 
up and impresses on ‘CALM’

KATIE BEEKMAN

Daily Arts Writer

In 2020, One Direction is a distant memory and 

Fifth Harmony feels like a fever dream. But the 

groups of the 2010s haven’t completely withered away 

yet. While other successful acts have succumbed to 

certain members going solo, Australian pop rock band 

5 Seconds of Summer has persisted in staying relevant. 

Their latest release CALM shows how they’ve managed 

to make it in the new decade. 

On CALM, the band sounds like they have moved 

out of their first studio apartment and into a sleek 

new bachelor pad — a far cry from their debut record’s 

garage-style grittiness. If their transition hadn’t been 

as smooth, the change in sound might be interpreted 

as selling-out to appease a more mainstream audience. 

However, their satisfyingly linear progression into 

crisper instrumentation makes their evolution feel 

inevitable.

On CALM the 5SOS soundscape is dark, bold and 

surprisingly tidy; however, they’ve matured without 

losing sight of their boyish beginnings. The strut-

worthy “No Shame,” for example, is a confession that 

the boys really do like the attention they’ve been getting. 

Wrapped up in shimmery production, they playfully 

admit “I love the way you’re screaming my name.” 

Though their refined new direction was a logical 

next step, 5SOS still had to stretch themselves to get 

there. The album opener “Red Desert” sounds as airy 

as the song title suggests. All four members harmonize 

throughout the track — something you’d be hard-

pressed to find anywhere else on their discography. 

On “Teeth,” lead singer Luke Hemmings’s breath 

functions as a beat. Overall, the effort they’ve put into 

experimenting while sounding polished can be heard 

throughout the album .

Still, CALM feels safe. The group walks the same 

lines they’ve drawn out for themselves since their 

beginning, just at glossier new heights. They continue to 

juggle sounding simultaneously sweet and edgy. They 

continue to build up acoustic production that explodes 

into euphoric pop moments. Most importantly, 5SOS 

continues to keep hold of their signature balancing act: 

being pop punk and mainstream radio-friendly.

Sometimes that means they sound kind of boring. On 

the first stretch of the album 5SOS comes out swinging, 

but by the last stretch they lose their momentum. “Best 

Days” and “Not in the Same Way” are sunny and soft, 

but easily grow drowsy. 

Similar to the band’s sound, CALM also marks a 

gradual expansion in 5SOS’s thematic territory. A 

throughline is the exploration of chaotic relationships. 

On rock-leaning “Easier” and rollicking “Lonely Heart,” 

Hemmings’s relationship hangs by a thread. Even in 

the more secure-sounding relationships detailed in 

“Wildflower” and “Lover of Mine,” subtle hints at 

past mistakes seem to anchor all of 5SOS’s romance in 

uncertainty.

It’s unsurprising then that CALM navigates identity 

in a way that feels very 20-something. On “Old Me” the 

group literally “shout outs” their old selves to thank 

them for all the good and bad they’ve brought into their 

lives now. They take a step back, however, on “Thin 

White Lies” to grieve their old selves.

B

y the Thursday of our first week 
of remote classes, I was already 
bored out of my mind. Time 

seemed no longer relevant; My days weren’t 
broken up by things like club meetings, 
office hours and trips to the dining hall. My 
classes were still being held at their original 
times, but everything else had abruptly 
ended. At first, I found myself filling the 
empty space with Netflix and YouTube 
videos, but they too lost their color quickly. 

One afternoon, out of sheer boredom, 

I decided to go through the bookshelf in 
my bedroom to see if I could find anything 
interesting to read. I started from the 
bottom shelf, which had collected a slight 
amount of dust since I left for college last 
fall. It was mostly full of books I’d read when 
I was younger, a large majority of them 
either The Boxcar Children or Magic Tree 
House. For some time, I sat there, studying 
the remnants of my childhood until I came 
across a stack of brightly colored spiral-
bound notebooks — my old journals. 

I first started journaling when I was little. 

My parents had encouraged me to write so 
I could improve my handwriting. One of 
my first notebooks dates as early as 2005, 
which means I would have been around age 
five. I wrote very simply — I listed how I 
was feeling at the time of writing and why, 
like “Today is Monday and I feel happy!” — 
accompanied by a self-drawn “Sketch of 
the Day.” In other entries, I decided not to 
write about myself; In a rainbow-colored 
notebook from 2008, I’d chosen to write 
about a cool glitter pen I’d found. A couple 
pages later, I told a story about a made-up 
princess. 

My journal entries varied in length, too. 

For example, one simply reads, “In a few 
days it will be my birthday!” while an entry 
a few pages before it reads, “Dear Diary, I 
am bored!” and then details exactly why for 
three whole pages. 

Regardless of the length or simplicity of 

the entries in my journals, it was clear that 
journaling was something I enjoyed doing. 
In many of the notebooks, there seemed to 
be an entry for nearly every day. Without 
fail, I had taken the time out of my day to 
write, reflect or say whatever else I wanted. 

By the sixth grade, with tennis and 

orchestra keeping me busy, I was starting 

to fall out of practice, 
and 
by 
high 
school, 

I’d dropped it entirely, 
with most of my time 
devoted to academics and 
extracurriculars. 
While 

my life was certainly full 
of more things I could’ve 
written about or worked 
through 
— 
crushes, 

failed 
assignments, 

disagreements 
with 

friends — it felt like there 
was just no time. My 
social life filled the gaps 
when I might’ve had time 
to write, and without my 
journals, I found myself 
feeling overwhelmed at 
times. 

Not only did I yearn 

for the ability to write 
down and reflect on my 
thoughts but I also missed 
the sheer art of journaling. 
To me, there had always 
been something relaxing in the act: It was 
comforting to write with a nice pen and see 
my thoughts unfolded before me in ink. 

Toward the latter half of high school, I 

attempted to restart my habit, a big motivator 
being the rise of the self-care movement. 
Journaling, thanks to its potential ment
al and physical health benefits, became a 
staple of self-care — and in the midst of it all, 
the bullet journal surged to popularity.

It’s very easy to see the appeal of bullet 

journaling, a practice in which one numbers 
their journal pages, creates an index and 
organizes their tasks, calendars and weekly 
logs from there. With one quick search on 
Google Images, you’re faced with a plethora 
of notebook pages covered in beautiful 
cursive letters, neatly written to-do lists 
and weekly schedules. In my eyes, the sheer 
amount of organization that went into a 
single bullet journal was both aesthetically 
pleasing and something to be envied. 

But, even after I did some research, which 

basically consisted of me skimming through 
articles and watching bullet journal setup 
videos on YouTube, I never successfully 
started my own bullet journal. While I 
definitely wanted to, I couldn’t bring myself 

to actually plan a whole notebook out. To be 
honest, I think I found the “aesthetic” part 
of bullet journaling too intimidating, too 
much of a commitment.

Instead, 
I 
tried 
another 
method: 

digital journaling. After typing those two 
words into my search bar, I came upon 
an article titled, “Think you’re too busy to 
journal? These apps let you do it on the go,” 
which detailed a list of five journal apps for 
iOS and Android. 

Journaling apps seemed like the perfect 

solution to everything I wanted — I wouldn’t 
have to set anything up if an app already did 
it for me. It seemed more efficient. An app on 
a phone, after all, is the epitome of efficiency. 
I could already see myself writing entries as 
I waited for orchestra practice to start. 

After trying several of the apps suggested 

in the article, I still wasn’t satisfied. Typing 
away on a phone, while quick and easy, 
didn’t feel the same as journaling. Not only 
was it a bit strange to not have a physical 
journal to write in, but it completely lacked 
the intimacy of handwriting. As far as I 
know, there is no digital way of accurately 
recreating the feeling of pressing pen to 
paper. 

Until I came across my old notebooks, I 

hadn’t thought about journaling in a while. 
As I sat in my bedroom flipping through 
pages, home from college two months early 
because of a global pandemic, I realized 
that now more than ever would be the best 
opportunity for me to start again. In the 
middle of this sudden, chaotic crisis, writing 
down my feelings and thoughts could be 
one of the best ways to mentally process the 
situation we’re all experiencing. 

Now, a new notebook sits on my bedside 

table. It’s a far cry from the colorful 
notebooks of my childhood: It’s a pale cream 
color with an exposed spine and softcover. 
I started it very recently. Its organization 
is practically nothing compared to a bullet 
journal. Instead, most of its entries are a 
stream of consciousness — all of my joys 
and sorrows bundled together in threaded 
binding. 

Each time I pick up the notebook, its 

pages still mostly empty, I feel no pressure 
to draw in colorful headers or write in neat, 
organized lines. I just write, with a simple 
black pen, and let the thoughts tumble from 
my brain and onto the page.

Wednesday, April 1, 2020 // The Statement 3B

Solomon and Matt are roommates. As 

roommates, they typically only see each other 
in the morning, maybe in between classes and 
before bed. However, COVID-19 said “LOL” 
and they have been shut together in their 
apartment for three weeks. These pieces, one 
by each roommate, were written in whatever 
fraction of isolation they could find on 
opposite sides of their shared living room.
S

olomon:

My biggest pet peeve is people 

using the idiom “It’s a small world.” 

It is often used to describe how privileged 
worlds overlap with one another (in my 
experience, the intersection of coastal Jews 
and the University of Michigan), rather 
than the actual size of the world. I have 
delivered PowerPoint presentations on the 
subject many times. But since we began 
social distancing, I have begun using the 
phrase unironically. 

Matt and I were randomly assigned as 

roommates in South Quad Residence Hall. 
Though our beds were four feet apart then, 
we have never lived as close together as we 
do now. Our world has literally become the 
size of our apartment, our rooms separated 
only by the staple room [EDIT: Clarify? 
What does “separated only by the staple 
room” mean?] of college houses — where 
one lives, dines and exists — and the kitchen 
whose full sink greets us every morning. 
As a result, we have perhaps learned more 
about one another in the past three weeks 
than we ever had, and are figuring out how 
to exist in a non-stop friendship. 

Three weeks ago, on the first day of social 

distancing, I brought a 2x4 whiteboard 
(formerly for our other roommate’s physics 
homework and personal account balance) 
out to the living room and nailed it to the 
wall. I was excited about it because I like 
making elaborate plans, and wanted to 
have agency over our future routines. Matt 
seemed skeptical, sitting on the couch as I 
divided up the board into the sections that 
would define our life. However, since then, 
it has become a mainstay of our life.

I titled the boxes on the upper-right 

corner “What are you?”, initially as a joke, 
but I quickly realized it was actually fitting. 
Our boxes show how we want to spend 
quarantine, our idealized vision for this 
unexpected time in our lives. Matt has 
continuously redone his box to reflect his 
biggest projects, including GarageBand 
exploration, Minecraft time limits for the 
day and to “finish the fucking play.” I have 
not erased anything from my section, which 
has progressively gotten fuller, explicitly 
laying out my aspirational basic daily plan 
(meditation, 
working 
out, 
journaling, 

etc.) and the long-term projects I have not 
started (clearing space off of my iPhone 5, 
research ideas and cooking adventures). 

It’s not just “What are you?” that 

uncovers our internal desires. We have 

connected more with every new communal 
section. Matt has taken ownership over the 
“Intellectual Flexing” section, where we 
write down the titles of the books we have 
read since we began isolating. Two weeks 
in, and he is already at five. (Buoyed by his 
rapid reading rate, he has since launched 
a bookstagram to literally no one’s surprise.)

My favorite section is “Principles,” 

where we lay out a mini-constitution to 
guide how we are supposed to share the 
space. To little surprise, the principles 
have not been followed, either because 
they were impossible to accomplish (“Give 
space”) or because they risk unsettling 
the equilibrium we have established (“Air 
grievances”). Our other, notably not Jewish, 
roommate has taken to chronicling the time 
we spend here by creating a new calendar 
system oriented around Shabbat dinner. 
Even in communal spaces, we have charted 
our own territories. 

I thought quarantine would strain our 

friendship by revealing all the ways in which 
our personalities are incompatible and 
how our interests do not overlap. To some 
extent, that has been true: I am not going 
to play Minecraft or Mario Kart, our band 
practice sessions have not really gotten off 
the ground and our sleep schedules remain 
out of sync. 

Yet, instead of just emphasizing how 

we are different, we are learning to 
coexist only as the most honest versions of 
ourselves. Quarantine has shown a more 
confident version of Matt than I have ever 
experienced before. He has been able to 
take our lifestyle change in stride, still 
waking up early to read, abiding by his 
whiteboard goals and remaining deliberate.

I have not had the same smooth 

transition. Without my usual stimuli of 
meetings and events, I anxiously await new 
full-length soccer games getting posted 
on YouTube and continue to cook without 
any big-picture vision — just assembling 
vegetables, carbs and some flavor in any 
combination. 

It has made me think about the difference 

between quarantine friendships and those 
we are used to. In most friendships, I have 
an escape route, but not here. I cannot take 
a break from Matt or my other roommate 
for a day. It has forced me to reveal the 
parts of my personality I usually reserve for 
myself, like my addiction to soccer media 
and inability to stay focused or fix broken 
items around the apartment. These details 
that may fall under the radar during the 
hectic pace of our everyday now are seen 
and felt. 

Our situation’s inescapability has also 

forced a level of honesty that is often hard 
to reach in masc friendships (friendships 
between masculine-identifying people). 
We are working on being more consistently 
honest with one another, airing out our 
grievances 
and 
asking 
for 
feedback. 

Without the ability to get the kind of 

emotional support we get from other parts 
of our lives in our normal lives, we have had 
to do more for one another than we used to. 

I don’t want to think about how COVID-

19 will impact my future, be it from worse 
job prospects or loved ones lost, so instead 
I am looking for quarantine’s silver linings. 
I know how lucky I am to be able to stay 
in Ann Arbor with Matt and my other 
roommates, and together we are learning 
how to share ourselves with minimal 
presentation or performance. Even after 
living together for almost two years, we are 
just now learning to coexist.
M

att: 

Dressed 
in 
presentable 

tops 
and 
less-presentable 

bottoms for virtual class, Solomon and I 
stare up at the whiteboard hanging in our 
living room. Our daily to-do lists, goals for 
the week, list of movies to watch and an 
elaborate time-keeping system revolving 
around communal meals and our aloe plant 
photoshoot schedule adorn its scuffed 
canvas. Meant to give our quarantined lives 
order, the whiteboard has since become 
another roommate, a projection of our 
cramped, hectic thoughts in this apartment.

“So what’s the order this week?” Solomon 

asks with an Expo marker bouncing 
between his fingers.

The recycled air that has been hanging 

in our living room since March 11 is filled 
with a mix of serious contemplation and 
nihilism.

“I think I did well. Read some books, 

started an essay,” I offer in the silence.

Solomon acquiesces and writes my 

name at the top of the “Who’s Winning 
Quarantine” list. Part of me is ashamed 
of trying too hard. Another is proud 
of my powering through the anxiety 
surrounding the state of the world and 
actually maintaining a semblance of my 
past schedule.

I don’t quite remember when the list 

appeared. It should be easy to recall a 
moment like this from the past two weeks. 
However, two weeks can feel like years 
when you spend every waking moment — 
and sometimes sleeping ones, if our nap 
times align — with the same person.

Before the United States began taking 

COVID-19 as seriously as it should have 
been months ago, we would share the highs 
and lows of our days if our paths happened 
to cross. Now, our daily highs, lows and the 
many shades in between are on full display 
without the need for a nightly debrief. Even 
in our rooms, I know if Solomon is on one 
of his many daily BlueJeans calls or if he’s 
doing laundry just from the small noises 
that leak throughout our apartment.

Our to-do lists are under a microscope 

in quarantine. Our new, two-dimensional 
roommate, looming over our living room, 
was supposed to maintain a sense of 
balance in our day-to-day. Instead, the 

whiteboard has become hell-bent on pitting 
our schedules against one another to see 
who is making the most of what everyone 
considers to be a shitty situation. 

Luckily, Solomon and I have been able 

to resist the temptation to compare our 
whiteboard schedules. During quarantine, 
I’ve embodied the full spectrum — from 
barely getting out of bed to planning my 
schedule minute-by-minute. Each day 
begins with a roll of the dice: Would 
crossing tasks off the whiteboard or making 
cup after cup of coffee and curling up with a 
book make me fulfilled today? 

I’m so thankful to have a roommate that 

greets me with a “I’m so proud of you” 
no matter what decision I make. I try to 
do the same. I do this to be a supportive 
partner in this quarantine dream but also 
to show our whiteboard roommate it’s our 
quarantine and we get to choose the coping 
mechanisms.

Solomon once wrote an opinion piece 

for this fine journalistic establishment 
about “The Grind” and our tendency to 
valorize being busy. Since our world is our 
living room for the foreseeable future, I’m 
learning to live über-communally without 
comparing myself to Solomon’s levels of 
productivity. 

Everyone and their cousins are writing 

think-pieces on what they think the world 
is going to look like when we reach the 
end of the COVID-19 tunnel. I will not 
add to this cacophony. However, I do hope 
that when social distancing is a by-gone 
practice, I take my personal wants instead 
of outward expectations into account when 
planning my day. I have a long way to go, 
but if there’s one thing we both share the 
most, it’s time.

T

hink about the last time you 
interrupted someone during 
class. I won’t judge. Was it 

because they were taking too long to 
finish their thought? Did you think of a 
better argument and decide to jump in? 
Were you simply asking them to speak 
louder? 

Now, think about the last time 

someone interrupted you. Did it bother 
you? Did you want to call them out, but 
were too afraid to speak up? When you 
tried to speak again, did you forget what 
you were going to say? 

If the first set of questions resonated 

with you more, it’s possible you’re an 
extrovert. If the second set of questions 
felt truer to you, it’s possible you’re 
an introvert. Though you might think 
you’re fully an “ambivert,” a mixture of 
these two traits, you probably do lean 
toward one side or another. It depends 
on if you get your energy from alone 
time or social interaction.

For me, I’ve always been more 

introverted. My parents caught onto 
this early in my childhood, though I 
admit it was pretty obvious — while 
my brother’s biggest fear was the dark, 
mine was talking to adults. But who 
could blame me? Every distant relative 
and family friend would tower over me, 
ask how old I was and expect me to say 
something cute or witty. I usually gave 
one-word answers and avoided eye 
contact. During holidays and dinner 
parties, I always had to escape to my 
room for a few minutes alone after every 
hour of socializing.

Growing up, I spent most of my 

time in my bedroom. Knowing this, 
my parents wouldn’t send me to my 
room as a punishment and instead told 
me to sit on the stairs as a “time-out.” 
It was agony, so close to the safety of 
my room yet completely vulnerable to 
interacting with anyone who decided 
to walk past me. It was forced social 
interaction. Maybe the possibility of 
this punishment was why I was so well-
behaved.

As I’ve gotten older, the amount 

of forced interactions has grown 
exponentially. I can’t live peacefully in 
my room anymore: I have to finish my 
extracurriculars, group projects and 
presentations before I can have my 
alone time. Adulthood is beginning to 
feel like one big networking event.

Like most introverts, I find myself 

deciding if I should over-exert myself 
at social events or stay at home and 
disappoint people by canceling on them. 

It’s a fine line because, even when I do 
socialize, I’m often interrupted or not 
taken seriously because I don’t speak 
much. When I stay in my bedroom for 
the night, my friends think I don’t want 
to spend time with them. There seems 
to be no right answer.

In her book, “Quiet: The Power 

of 
Introverts 
in 
a 
World 
that 

Can’t 
Stop 
Talking,” 
author 
and 

psychologist Susan Cain traces our 
extrovert-centric culture to the early 
20th century, when Dale Carnegie and 
other businessmen began their ascent 
to success through public speaking and 
sales. As consumerism grew, the more 
our culture shifted toward selling the 
appearance of a product, which quickly 
translated into personality as well.

While smaller businessmen and 

farmers once valued “inner quality” 
over “outer quality,” when louder 
personalities entered the scene with 
bigger voices and bigger ideas, they 
took hold and became mainstream. As 
companies grew, the American ideal for 
success matched their faces: it doesn’t 
matter what you’re selling, it’s how you 
sell it — and if you sell yourself well, 
you’ll be successful.

Today, our society is centered around 

this ideal, so identifying as one of the 
quiet ones isn’t exactly something 
to call attention to. Many introverts 
find themselves “pretending” to be 
extroverts, as I have done in my time 
working in corporate America, waiting 
for the release of alone time in the 
bathroom between meetings or on my 
commute home. 

Though this extrovert norm may 

feel natural in the United States, 
other 
cultures 
don’t 
all 
function 

like ours — other nations have more 
introverted norms like independence, 
while the United States is among the 
most extrovert-centric. Open floor 
plans, required participation grades and 
large social circles fuel our capitalist 
society, equating sociability and stage 
presence with success.

In her book, Cain goes on to cite the 

University of Michigan Ross School 
of Business and its push toward group 
projects and constant collaboration to 
promote extrovert tendencies. She calls 
this idea the “New GroupThink,” or the 
mainstream preference of collaborative 
work over individual work. She goes 
on to mention that solitude can be 
the clearest path to efficiency and 
innovation, particularly pointing to the 
top computer scientists, musicians and 

college students who always prioritize 
working individually. Still, business 
schools are weaving social skills into 
their degree requirements, taking a cue 
from Carnegie and other businesspeople 
of his time. (For the record, I’ve been 
searching for years and still have never 
met an introvert in Ross. Let me know if 
you find one. I want to talk.)

Though it may not be to the same 

extent, the rest of the University sets 
itself up as an extroverted school where 
the “Leaders and the Best” — or maybe 
“loudest and the best” is more fitting 
— are constantly connecting. 
Students are heavily encouraged 
to go to office hours and may find 
themselves without letters of 
recommendation if they are too 
socially anxious to do so. Grades 
will suffer if students do not 
speak up frequently during class. 
As I’ve written about before in 
The Daily, career fairs are often 
framed as mandatory and the 
only way to find a job post-grad. 
In a place where many students 
feel like they’re not doing 
enough, introverts face the same 
pressures but often have less 
social energy to keep up with 
everyone else.

To an extrovert, the introvert’s 

dilemma may be a simple fix. 
“Can’t you just go up to someone 
and start talking to them?” 
they might ask, or “Shouldn’t 
everyone get a rush from going 
to a party?” This might be a good 
time to point out that people 
don’t “choose” to be an introvert; 
as Cain cites in her book, it’s 
been psychologically proven that 
acetylcholine is more active in 
introverts’ brains, which gives 
them pleasure from remaining 
calm and focusing on one thing 
for a long time. To contrast, 
dopamine is more active in 
extroverts’ 
brains 
which 

provides the motivation to seek 
external rewards like earning 
money and climbing the social ladder.

Cain also points out the contrasting 

effects of these neurotransmitters on the 
brain: Introverts are more likely to share 
private information online because of 
the removed social cues. Extroverts 
are often more impulsive. Introverted 
babies are often the ones that cry, 
not 
extroverts, 
because 
they’re 

more reactive and have a lower threshold 
for stimuli. Other species have introverts 

and extroverts that find specific 
habitats to suit their personality, such as 
“sitter” fruit flies that tend to stay in one 
place and “rover” fruit flies that tend to 
explore more. 

Curious about the effects of this 

personality difference on the University 
community, I met with four students 
who identify as introverts, each at 
various points in their college careers, 
and asked about how they’re managing 
to thrive despite the pressures of hustle 
culture.

I

n early March, just a week 
before 
classes 
were 
moved 

online, I met with LSA senior 

Alexandra Niforos (she/her) at the 
Michigan League. She was sitting by 
herself doing work in Maizie’s Kitchen 
& Market before I arrived. As an 
executive producer for MUSKET, the 
largest student-run musical theatre 
organization on campus, she had been 
working nonstop for the past few 

weeks preparing for their upcoming 
production. I imagine her Google 
Calendar was completely filled with 
meetings and rehearsals.

Based on her schedule, you might not 

have guessed Niforos is an introvert. In 
fact, she even chose her major, English, 
based on its level of introversion, 
recognizing that her need for alone time 
conflicted with her love for musical 
theatre.

“I actually wanted to apply to SMTD, 

but decided not to because I don’t thrive 
in performance,” she said. “That world 

is too extroverted for me, so I like 
dictating things from the administrative 
side (through MUSKET).” 

Though Niforos is often energized by 

spending time with friends or producing 
a show, she always reaches a limit with 
these interactions. Some situations may 
be quicker to exhaust her than others, 
but she always hits a point when she 
needs to go home.

“Ideally, I would spend 50 percent of 

my time alone,” she said. “But I never 
get that.” 

When I asked why not, she scoffed, 

“Because I do a million and one things!”

Niforos lamented the pressure of 

being successful in college, which 
includes going to classes (although 
she has purposefully never taken a 
course that includes the phrase “group 
project” in the description) and having 
an impressive resume. She does enjoy 
being productive and made clear that 
she only involves herself in what she’s 
passionate about, but even her passions 

leave her in desperate need of alone 
time. Yet, it’s difficult to clear the time 
in her day for it.

“I don’t know, it just seems selfish 

to prioritize (solitude),” she said. “It’s 
hard to say that I need an hour at home 
because that’s not socially acceptable. 
I just feel this pressure all the time to 
adapt to a world that doesn’t fit (my) 
personality style and the way of being 
my best self.”

To 
cope 
with 
the 
pressure, 

Niforos said she does spend equal 
time recovering after intense social 
interaction. For example, by taking 
a week off after an intensive week 
finishing a MUSKET production.

Sanjay Das (he/him), a U-M alumnus 

with a degree in biomolecular science 
and current medical student at Central 
Michigan 
University, 
expressed 
a 

similar sentiment to Niforos in needing 
equal recovery time to interaction time. 

“If I go through a period of 

extrovertedness, 
I 
then 
have 
to 

go 
through 
a 
phase 
of 

introvertedness,” Das told The 
Daily in a phone interview. 
“I do prefer to be more in an 
introverted 
zone, 
because 

every day I feel like I have 
only a certain amount of social 
battery charge.”

As a freshman at the 

University, Das did what many 
introverts 
would 
probably 

avoid — he joined Beta Theta 
Pi, a social fraternity. Rather 
than being burned out by 
constant social interaction, 
however, Das noted that the 
fraternity helped him make 
friends as an introvert.

“Actually, the only thing 

that made the University 
bearable was Beta Theta Pi,” 
he said. 

Throughout 
his 
time 

as a pre-med student, Das 
constantly felt the need to be 
productive, which conflicted 
with his introversion and left 
him feeling burned out.

“I just thought, ‘I have 

to take this extra class or 
stay extra hours in the lab 
just to put myself in a more 
advantageous place for when 
I apply to medical school,’” he 
said.

Now in medical school, he’s 

hoping to become a surgeon or 
incorporate research into his 

career to make more time for solitude 
within his work.

Though Das has found great success 

through his introversion, he also 
believes 
extroversion 
is 
necessary 

for the medical field and often finds 
himself assuming those who are social 
are the most successful. He noted his 
University experience would have been 
easier had he not been introverted.

“If I were an extrovert, I wouldn’t 

have avoided stuff because it was too 
far out of my comfort zone,” he said. 
“I think I would have gotten more out 
of U-M, since I felt shell-shocked with 
everything that was going on.”

Parker 
Kehrig 
(they/them), 
an 

LSA sophomore studying sociology 
and women’s studies, is also dealing 
with a University culture that values 
productivity and extroversion. Kehrig 
and I are from the same competitive 
hometown, Grosse Pointe, so I related 
to a lot of their points. Our interview 
in the Shapiro Undergraduate Library 
ended up being a lot louder than one 
would expect from two introverts. 

“I just think there’s a certain amount 

of extroversion that’s expected here, 
with an emphasis on networking and 
party culture,” they said. “There’s 
this idea at ‘top-tier’ universities that 
everyone has to be running all the 
time and if you’re not running, you’re 
failing ... If you don’t pass out, you’re not 
working hard enough.”

Kehrig pointed out the relationship 

between this productivity mindset and 
capitalism, which leads one to think 
that missing out on anything is turning 
down a valuable opportunity. Because 
Kehrig wants to get into graduate school 
and make a living wage, they said they 
have to buy into this mindset somewhat 
and load up their schedule.

When asked about their schedule 

this semester, they responded, “I’m 
taking 16 credits, working at Spectrum 
Center, helping with a UROP project 
about criminalization confinement, and 
participating in the Telluride House.”

As a result, there are times when the 

fear of missing out, or FOMO, keeps 
Kehrig from getting enough alone 
time to recharge. They also experience 
anxiety, 
which 
exacerbates 
their 

introverted tendencies and often makes 
it difficult to focus in public spaces.

“If I wasn’t so anxious, maybe I 

would be more extroverted,” they said. 
“Sometimes I do have to leave a function 
when I’m not in the right headspace, but 
I also can’t cancel … (because) I have 
FOMO.”

Kehrig still made it clear that they 

love spending time with people and 
making new friends, they just need to 
balance their social life with their alone 
time to avoid becoming overwhelmed.

Trevor McCarty (he/him), a graduate 

student in the School for Environment 
and Sustainability (SEAS) who received 
his 
bachelor’s 
in 
Biopsychology, 

Cognition and Neuroscience, mirrored 

similar feelings as Kehrig in his 
sociability. McCarty reached out to 
me a few months ago to respond to 
my first Daily article about introversion, 
recognizing the similarities between us, 
and I was intrigued by his confidence 
in cold-emailing a stranger. We met at 
Amer’s Delicatessen for an interview in 
early March.

McCarty reiterated that introversion 

doesn’t mean you don’t like being 
around people, it means you need a 
recuperation period afterward because 
it takes energy.

“People 
think 
introversion 
is 

synonymous with shyness and there 
are probably correlations, but it’s 
not the same thing,” he said. “I’m 
very expressive with my friends. 
And I actually do really well in both 
collaborative and individual learning 
spaces, I think learning with people is 
better.”

McCarty compared the introversion 

and extroversion of his undergraduate 
program with his graduate program, 
which offered him different outlets for 
socializing.

“BCN is so big that you can just be a 

fly on the wall — I just went to class then 
came home and did my homework,” he 
said. “SEAS is much smaller than most 
undergrad programs and lends itself 
to people socializing outside of class. 
Being an extrovert is definitely better 
there because you can connect easier 
with a wider variety of people.” 

McCarty 
is 
studying 
climate 

adaptation and resilience, focusing on a 
framework that will allow communities 
to adapt in the face of climate change. 
Because McCarty is so passionate about 
his work, he said that it’s easy to talk to 
people who are interested in the same 
thing as him, even though big program 
events can be draining.

McCarty has never been ashamed 

of his introversion and rather sees it 
as a way to find “the spaces that make 
(him) feel the most (himself).” Because 
of his positive outlook on introversion, 
McCarty wishes others valued it more.

“As a child, I felt like I had to get out 

of my shyness, like I was thrown into 
the water and couldn’t swim,” he said. 
“That seems wrong … We need to have 
a society where extroversion is not seen 
as the default, where we cultivate the 
kind of value that can be gained from 
introverts.”

I

n March of 2019, my younger 
brother Jack and I found ourselves 
shoulder to shoulder on an itchy 

cot in the lemon-scented, linoleum-tiled 
hallway of the University of Michigan 
emergency room. He assured me for the 
umpteenth time that I was fine, but the 
sharp pain in my chest told me otherwise. 
Jack’s pragmatic mind knew enough about 
my history of anxiety and hypochondria 
to know that I was suffering from a panic 
attack, and not heart failure, but he sat 
patiently beside me for the five enduring 
hours. He stayed there, empathetic, until 
my vitals were declared perfect, my chest 
clear and I was handed a blue-grey inhaler 
for “exercise-induced asthma” and a 
bubblegum pink discharge slip. 

There’s one word to describe my brother, a 

first-year pre-med student: sensible. He acts 
with realism and quietude. He’s easygoing, 
down-to-earth and erudite. Going to school 
on the same campus as my brother Jack 
is uncomplicated and bright; he has an 
inherent impulse to put others at ease. 

This is why Jack didn’t object to the 

10-and-a-half hour drive we had to endure 
together from Ann Arbor, Michigan to 
Fair Haven, New Jersey, when University 
President Mark Schlissel urged students 
to go home to avoid further exposure to 
the rapidly spreading COVID-19. For all of 
college, we had never driven to or from New 
Jersey: It was too long of a drive, mostly 
on open highways, which triggered my 
anxiety. There was, then, a sentimentality 
to the departure, and its intangible ironies. 
The last time leaving Ann Arbor as an 
undergraduate student would be nestled 
among a first. 

After bartering with my parents to stay in 

Ann Arbor for a few more days before leaving, 
so I could give my goodbyes to hulking 
buildings and people who have impacted my 
journey in immeasurable ways, we rented a 
2018 silver Mitsubishi. 

As it drew closer to when I had to leave 

town, I treated every goodbye as a “see you 
soon” and pushed sentimentality from my 
mind as if it had no place there. Pathetic 

fallacy welcomed sorrow to the array of 
emotions I was feeling as it poured rain my 
entire last day in Ann Arbor. I packed the 
backseat of the car with trash bags of grey-
purple bedding, boxes of faded The Michigan 
Daily newspapers and suitcases bursting 
with heavy sweaters and rainbow scarves. 
In my chest lived an unnerving cocktail of 
isolation and desolation. I’d never felt so 
without a home before, as I did now, being 
uprooted from Michigan, a place where I 
had learned, lost and grown: I started college 
with long hair, pink bedding and dreams of 
sorority houses and fraternity boys, and I 
ended with short, chin-length hair, a lack 
of Greek life affiliation and a deep-seated 
passion for writing poems and telling stories. 

I knew it would never truly feel like the 

right time to leave Michigan, but there 
definitely is a wrong time. There I was, 
standing in front of a rental car packed with 
my entire life, seven weeks before the closure 
that was supposed to make a semi-sweet 
goodbye feel, at the very least, conventional. 

That’s why, as I got into the driver’s seat 

of that same overpacked Mitsubishi the 
next morning, a road trip playlist titled “It 
is 100% Coronatime” playing softly in the 
background, I focused on our drive and 
destination — not the departure. 

The plan was for Jack and me to split 

the drive in half. We spent the first five 
hours of the drive on a road trip euphoria. 
We laughed and reminisced, telling 
one another stories about the questions 
smartass kids asked in humid lecture 
halls, roommates that go to Chipotle for 
brunch every Sunday, sweaty parties full of 
theater majors where something ironically 
dramatic happened and the idiosyncratic 
people we’d left behind. We listened 
through the Camp Rock 1 and 2 soundtracks 
and sang along to Bruce Springsteen songs. 
There was strange tranquility as I drove 
down Ohio’s stretch of I-80, sipping on a 
Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. After a while, we 
just drove quietly, both lost in thought.
J

ack began begging me to drive once 
it hit noon. At 1:30 p.m., I pulled 
into the nearest gas station. Jack 

filled the gas while I got into the passenger 
seat, both glad he was to drive the rest of 
the way. We ate yogurt-covered pretzels 
and sang along to the Hamilton soundtrack 
for the first half-hour that he sat behind the 
wheel. The Pennsylvania highway began to 
empty of cars and fill with thick, foggy air. 

At 2 p.m., an aunt of ours who we hadn’t 

spoken to in a while called. She wanted 
to see how the drive was, and perhaps, 
subliminally, make us feel some strain 
of guilt for not leaving Ann Arbor five 
days earlier. She went on for 20 minutes 
about what her family had been doing to 
quarantine, referencing terrible stories of 
people in New Jersey who’d passed away 
due to the virus. 

“Have you been social distancing at 

school?” She asked, poking around for 
information about Ann Arbor, where the 
first few cases had begun to pop up just as 
we pulled away from campus. 

“Uh … sort of, I mean, things were just 

starting to close when we left. We said 
goodbye to our friends,” I said, trying to 
understand why it was important to her. I 
didn’t know what to say, feeling suddenly 
guilty, 
even 
though 
every 
goodbye 

was from a distance — light taps of our 
sweatshirt-covered elbows. 

“Well, what’s your plan when you get 

home? What have your parents been 
doing?” My brother and I shared a muddled 
glance. When we finally hung up, dread and 
apprehension hung in the air-conditioned 
car that hadn’t before. 
A

s we continued driving, I noticed 
that Jack had been coughing 
and yawning for the bulk of the 

drive. I knew this wasn’t abnormal for him, 
as he’d been on allergy medication since he 
was a toddler and sometimes his symptoms 
come back when he forgets to take it. “Have 
you been taking your meds?” I asked.

“No,” 
he 
answered, 
yawning 
and 

focusing on the road. 

“Do you think you should tell mom and 

dad you’re coughing then? So they can 
refill your meds or something — you don’t 
want them to freak out,” I said cautiously, 
noticing him yawn again. 

“Maybe,” he said, yawning and coughing 

again. He’d told me he went to bed at 2:30 
a.m. the morning before we left, and I 
figured his impending exhaustion and 
the intermittent bursts of coughing would 
distract him from the road, which was 
growing foggier as we found ourselves 
deeper in Pennsylvania. 

“Pull over,” I said, referencing a wide 

shoulder off the highway. “I think I 
should drive. You’re tired and you seem 
distracted.” 

Without any sort of argument or 

rebuttal, he pulled over onto the shoulder. 
That’s when I sensed something could 
be wrong — an edge of anxiety rising 
in my chest. Though I normally worry 
relentlessly about everyone I care about, 
this time I suppressed the urge and focused 
on being responsible, nurturing and 
cautious. Jack went relatively silent for the 
next 90 minutes and I tried to keep my leg 
from cramping to drive with ease. I figured 
he was tired. I glanced in the mirror, 
eventually, and met his eyes. I know my 
brother, and I can see it in his face when 
something is wrong.

Finding peace in the Mitsubishi

H

ave you ever hated someone? If so, did you feel it 
consume or distract you? Did it eat away at your 
thoughts in the hours before falling asleep or 

as you daydreamed in class? Did you avoid going to certain 
places or partaking in certain activities because you knew 
that person would be present? 

Most of us have or will hate someone else in our lives. Hate 

appears in many forms, from hating entire groups of people 
down to individuals. It is an intense and raw emotional 
state that requires focus, energy and dedication. If you 
actively choose to say you hate someone, you have to really 
concentrate on how and where your hate is being directed. 

The strange, fluid nature of human hatred leads me to 

frequently wonder if anyone out in the world is brooding 
around, hating me. It’s an unhealthy concept to dwell upon, 
but I’m a curious person by nature. 

The only story of substance I ever received about being 

truly hated by someone was told to me from a friend in 
middle school. In the seventh grade, her friend started hating 
me because I did not apologize after letting a loose basketball 
hit her in the face. I distinctly remember asking if she was 
OK, but I guess I didn’t say “sorry.”

Hindsight is 20/20, and I definitely should’ve been smarter 

and apologized. Children can be petty, but was that one 
moment of being unapologetic enough for me to be perceived 
as the villain in another’s eyes? Can a single moment of neglect 
forever define how you can be viewed by someone? Surely, 
there are countless times where I was painfully singled out 
in middle school dodgeball, but I can’t claim that those who 
threw those rubber balls at my own head were my enemies. 
Though childhood hatred is a natural aspect of growing up, 
feelings of contempt can permeate into adulthood.

Looking back, I’ve definitely disliked people before. A 

physics teacher who never called me by my full first name. 
An ex-girlfriend who didn’t like it when I danced in public. 
Some colleagues after a fallout about work. A family member, 
maybe for a day or two. Individuals in college with whom I 
desperately wanted to be friends, only they didn’t give me 
the time of day only because I didn’t go to the same church 
as them. 

Over time, I questioned whether outright avoiding 

confrontation with those whom I dislike would eventually 
just lead me down a deep road to truly hating them. If you 

spend enough time with someone, you 
eventually realize they’re not really so 
terrible, and it’s harder to full-heartedly 
hate them. But if you actively choose not 
to encounter them, it’s easier to let your 
mind run wild, creating feelings and 
ideas and memories that might make it 
easier to hate the person.

Despite all these experiences, I can’t 

honestly say I’ve ever “hated” anyone. 
But it would be unfair to myself and my 
experienced emotions to move these 
people from the “dislike” side of my brain 
to the “like” side as if it were nothing. 
I’m fighting against a human instinct to 
want to separate individuals into mental 
boxes of good and bad. I definitely have 
friends who have no problem separating 
individuals into categories with varying 
degrees of hate: This person is on my side, 
but this person did me wrong. This friend 
from graduate school can come to the 
wedding. This family member can’t see 
my baby. 

When we initially see someone as different than us, the 

amygdala region of the brain affiliated with fear begins to 
spike. Our emotions can be unknowingly validated by our 
brain if those fears are substantiated by a negative interaction. 
As negative feelings toward someone increase, our fight-or-
flight instincts become the only way to deal with such a large 
irritant. But people’s actions are more gray and less two-sided 
than what our primal social instincts want to let on. Everyone 
has someone who loves them, but everyone has their own 
faults. Most people claim to be for civil rights, but nobody is 
born woke. People contain multitudes.

Whether you’re an ideological extremist or just a normal 

person learning how to navigate the world, learning how 
to un-hate — or recognize hate in the first place — can be a 
difficult process. I feel the bumps of this journey myself: 
I know I have to learn to accept that no matter how hard I 
might try to appease everyone, some people in my own life 
will just dislike me. But what about the people who claim to 
hate me? What about my actions caused them to cross the line 
between general distaste to focused, meaningful hate? Was it 
a moment of carelessness that they chose to remember? Was 
it a habit that I didn’t have the perspective to correct? Was I 
sexist? Too political? Flat-out annoying? 

Learning to let go of those worries is a difficult 

commitment. In time, you may begin to realize how letting 
go of anger makes it easier to embrace love; not necessarily 
the romantic kind of love, but the fraternal kind as well.

There’s a similar relationship with hate that exists with 

the concept of love. The two emotional states, love and hate, 
rest on placing people, objects and ideas into subjective 
categories — black and white binaries of good and bad. Both 
hate and love requires care and some sort of reasoning for 
why you choose to treat that person, thing or abstract thought 
differently than others. Does the sight of your grandmother’s 
empty rocking chair bring up intense, confusing emotions? 
Even if your feelings are mixed, you might have to resort to 
either “loving” it or “hating” it due to colloquial constraints. 
In the end, the only difference in how strongly one feels 
regarding their love versus their hate is that hatred is much 
easier to practice.

Another aspect that links love and hate is how their usage 

in the English language has evolved superficially. From 
an idiomatic standpoint, “hate” is a word that is thrown 

around pretty loosely among young people. It has become so 
entrenched in our hyperbolic descriptions of the world that 
after a while, it kind of loses its meaning. I hate kale. I hate 
going to the gym. I hate Donald Trump. The word’s own 
substance dissipates when it’s used to equally describe one’s 
feelings toward a bitter salad base and the leader of the free 
world. 

The blurred lines of defining our distaste for petty 

misdeeds come in tandem with the limitations of the English 
language. There are very few ways to express a strong dislike 
without coming across as explicit or serious. If you look up 
the word “hate” on thesaurus.com, chances are you’ll find 
that the synonyms that come up come across as far too 
pompous and bombastic for daily usage. Hate becomes one 
of the softest words in its own category. You could mention 
that you dislike something. You dislike school. You dislike a 
particular restaurant. But if you dislike something more than 
normal, how do you articulate that feeling? You’d prefer not 
to eat at Quiznos? That sounds even weirder. Your resentment 
has to come across as stronger if you want to make a point. 
Would you tell others that you loathe hummus? Do you hold 
hummus in animosity? No, you simply resort to telling people 
you hate hummus out of the simplicity that we’ve associated 
with the word.

There will never be a time in life where you won’t have 

to deal with difficult people. It’s a truth most will have to 
learn the hard way by virtue of simply growing up, through 
first heartbreaks, being on the e-board of a club or trying to 
start out at a job. However, there lies trouble with how we 
use the word “hate” in our vernacular and usage: If we use 
such a powerful word so frequently, it will only diminish its 
meaning where it’s needed most. In addition to lessening our 
fundamental understandings of hate speech and hate crimes, 
we numb ourselves to the emotional weight that a word like 
“hate” carries. If our perception of hate becomes so skewed, 
we’ll be unable to recognize the truly perverse and evil kinds 
of hate that seek to pull us apart. 

The most important concept to grasp in learning to let go 

of anger is learning to acknowledge your ego. Hatred often 
arises when we have been wronged in a way that lowers 
our self-esteem. We want to protect ourselves by projecting 
emotions on others. What steps can I take to ensure there 
are no “me versus them” mentalities lingering along in my 
subconscious? 

I don’t intend to proclaim I’ve figured out how to stop 

hating; nobody has. Even though I’m able to boast about not 
personally hating anyone, I desperately crave the mental 
capacity to open up and become aware of what I may still 
be overlooking. I think we can all take small steps forward 
to improve our understanding of hatred and how our 
casualization of language might end up hurting it.

We come to college to challenge our ideas and assumptions, 

and more importantly, to grow through thought. But how 
do we begin to recognize when we might find ourselves 
putting groups into boxes? How can I work harder to extend 
myself beyond the communities in which I’ve been brought 
up and confined to? What clubs haven’t I explored? What 
events might help me meet new people? Through consistent 
engagement with social settings that we might individually 
deem uncomfortable, the hard path to letting go of hate just 
might become easier.
