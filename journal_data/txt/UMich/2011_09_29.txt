UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
New women's
hospital hosts
discussion on
cervical cancer

Journalist Joan
Lunden, doctors
promote screenings
to detect disease
By TAYLOR WIZNER
For the Daily
In anticipation of the grand
opening of the newly constructed
C.S. Motts Children's Hospital
and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital in November, more than
400 people came together yester-
day to promote women's health.
The Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital - part of the University
of Michigan Health System -
hosted a panel yesterday morning
at the North Campus Research
Complex to commemorate Wom-
en's International Health and
Fitness Day. The panel, moder-
ated by journalist Joan Lunden,
discussed cervical cancer screen-
ing and health issues that affect
women across the globe.
Lunden, a long-time television
host for ABC's Good Morning
America, has reported numerous
stories on women's health, which

helped her realize the impor-
tance of cervical cancer screen-
ings.
"(We are doing this) to try and
get each and every woman out
there to commit herself to her
own health, educate herself on
how to make better nutritional
choices, to get the proper screens
she needs throughout her life-
time and to keep her weight in
check and to put regular activity
into her life," Lunden said.
The benefit aimed to encour-
age women to take advantage of
screenings for cervical cancer
since the cancer is treatable if
detected early.
"Fifty percent of all cancers
are preventable," Lunden said.
"Right here in our country there
is so much that we can do to make
sure that we get screens available
to the public."
Liz Lange, founder and cre-
ative director of clothing line
Liz Lange Maternity and Com-
pletely Me by Liz Lange and
a panel member, said she was
shocked when the results of
her routine scan showed she
had cervical cancer. Lange, a

updates, hybrid buses

Federal grant to
fund Blake Transit
Center renovation
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily Staff Reporter
Not only will Ann Arbor's
public transit system be getting
a facelift in upcoming years, it
will also be reducing its carbon
footprint.

The Ann Arbor Transporta-
tion Authority announced on
Tuesday that it will receive a
$2.7 million grant from the Fed-
eral Transportation Adminis-
tration. The funding will be used
for infrastructure improve-
ments to the Blake Transit Cen-
ter in downtown Ann Arbor and
the addition of 10 hybrid buses
to join the 31 currently operat-
inginthe city.
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) wrote in an e-mail inter-

view to The Michigan Daily
yesterday that the addition of
hybrid buses will reduce harm-
ful gas emissions. The new
buses, along with the Blake
Transit Center updates, will
create more jobs in the state,
Dingell wrote.
"This funding will play a
critical role in expanding and
enhancing transportation
options for Ann Arbor to help
us retain, create and attract jobs
to Washtenaw County," Dingell

wrote. "Both of these projects
will help the AATA operate
more efficiently and effectively,
working to better public trans-
portation and economic secu-
rity for Southeast Michigan."
The addition of the 10 hybrid
buses will bring the total num-
ber of TheRide buses to 78,
including the non-hybrid buses.
The grant for the purchase of
the buses comes from the Clean
Fuels Bus and Bus Facilities

Daily Staff Reporter
Instead of calling the police in
an emergency, new mobile appli-

cations allow students in dan-
gerous situations to receive help
with the click of a button.
Safety mobile apps collect
users' personal information,
which is sent to police in an
emergency when the user acti-
vates the app. However, while
app developers say the technol-
ogy is intended to increase stu-

should primarily dial 911 or
activate the blue light system on
campus during an emergency.
One of the mobile apps is

Magazine calls

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA and

Daily StaffReporter and
Daily News Editor
University Prof. Hashim Al-
Hashimi, a biophysical chemist,
has moved beyond his lab to the

pages of Popular Science.
The magazine recently
named Al-Hashimi one of this
year's "Brilliant 10"- agroup of
young researchers recognized
for their accomplishments -
for his project involving nucle-
ar imaging of DNA and RNA
movements. Popular Science
gave him the title "Molecular
Filmmaker."
Al-Hashimi, who has worked
for the University since August
2002, is using nuclear magnetic

spectroscopy, which he com-
pares to an MRI with a higher
magnetic field, to examine
individual atoms that make up
structures such as DNA and
proteins. Using this technol-
ogy, Al-Hashimi and his team
- including several University
graduate students -have found
that DNA is a moving molecule,
rather than a static structure.
Unlike previous methods of
studying molecules, the nuclear

Bringing Latin to life

Why did you decide to
bring spoken Latin to the
University?
When I was hired, I was
asked by my colleagues if
I could speak Latin, and I
didn't know that anyone
did. So I decided to do an
exploration of that, and it
brought me to Rome and
to California. And in the
process, I discovered that
there were pedagogical
reasons for incorporating
spoken Latin into the cur-
riculum.
How did you make
your way to the Univer-
sity?
I was a graduate student

here because it's one of
the great programs in the
country. I was an under-
graduate for nine years,
but my last four years were
at the University of Wash-
ington. I'm from Seattle. I
started at Boston Universi-
ty as a music major. Iended
up with a double degree in
classics and comparative
literature.
Is Latin a dead lan-
guage? Do you feel that
there will be a revival of
Latin?
No.I don't see it as a lan-
guage that one is going to
learn as a first language.
I know people who have

taught their children Latin
pretty much from birth, so
I've been around kids who
are quite young, who speak
quite well. But it's still not
the only language they
learn, and it's not their
primary language. I can't
really imagine an envi-
ronment where it could
become the primary lan-
guage. On the other hand,
Latin has never stopped
beingspoken.
What is your favorite
class to teach?
Whichever one I'm
teaching at the moment.
What are the goals of
your courses?

I want what students
learn in my class to go
with them outside of the
class and beyond. I want
them to have a differ-
ent relationship with the
classical world, whether
it's the Latin language or
the Greek language or the
civilization. I want them
to think about language
differently. I want them to
understand English better.
I want the kind of work
we do in class and the
kind of thinking that they
learn to do to go with them
throughout life.

The Rev. Al Sharpton says he
will lead a march in Washington
next month in support of Presi-

criticize Obama over high black

As Sharpton announced plans

whether there is a double standard
in failing to hold Obama account-
able for joblessness among blacks.
The leader of the Congressio-

The double standard, Sharpton
says, is that most black politicians

Gov't gives patients
monthly supply of
medical marijuana
The U.S. government consid-
ers marijuana among the world's
most dangerous drugs, classifying
it as a highly-addictive substance
that has no medical use.
But there's a catch: The gov-
ernment also supplies four people
with 300 marijuana cigarettes
each month. They are patients in
the government's Compassionate
Investigational New Drug Pro-
gram.
The program began when a
Washington, D.C., man sued the
government in order to get access
to marijuana to treat his glau-
coma. He won, and the program
was born.
The pot is grown in Missis-
sippi as part of the government's
research into marijuana. It's then
sent to a facility in North Caro-

rettes.

U.N. reports gains
in fight against
* famine in Somalia
The U.N. yesterday said food
assistance has reached nearly
half the Somalis in need, though
it warned cases of diarrhea and
cholera could spike with the sea-
sonal rains expected in October.
Famine relief has gotten to
about 1.85 million Somalis, the
U.N. Office for the Coordination
of HumanitarianAffairs said.
The World Health Organiza-
tion, meanwhile, reports that
cases of diarrhea and cholera
are down, though October rains
could pose a high risk of trans-
mission of waterborne diseases in
highly populated camps for those
displaced by the famine.
Tens of thousands of Somalis
already have died from a lack of
food, and the U.N. says 750,000
more are at risk of death from
famine in the next four months.
Six areas in southern Somalia
have been declared famine zones.

still needed more help, with 58
percent of them being frequent
or monthly users.
"Those dollars don't go very
far," said Vicki Escarra, presi-
dent of the Chicago-based Feed-
ing America.
The report "really puts kind
of a fine point on the fact that
food banks are becoming the
new normal for a large percent-
age of the population," she said.
It's not the role they were
created for, she said, "but we are
doing that right now because we
have to."
According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, 14.5 per-
cent U.S. households, about 17
million, were termed "food-
insecure" in 2010, a jump from
about 11 percent in 2007. Of
those households, 6.4 million
had very low food security,
meaning one or more members
of the household had eating pat-
terns disrupted because of lack
of money or other resources for
food.

Violent incidents
up 39 percent from
same time last year
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
The monthly average of armed
clashes, roadside bombings and
other violence in Afghanistan
is running 39 percent ahead of
last year's figure, U.N. reported
yesterday, with more complex
suicide operations involvingmul-
tiple bombers and gunmen.
The statistics show that the
intensity of the nearly decade-old
war is growing, not abating, as
the U.S. and other nations start
to withdraw some forces with
an eye toward pulling all combat
troops out by the end of 2014. The
Taliban's resilience raises ques-
tions about whether the Afghan
government and its Western
allies have a solid grip on secu-
rity - and whether the Afghan
forces can ever secure the nation
by themselves.
NATO says it has made prog-
ress in taming the Taliban insur-
gency by routing its strongholds
in the south. But the Taliban have
hit back with several high-profile
attacks in the capital and assas-
sinations of government officials
and senior Afghan leaders.

In its quarterly report on
Afghanistan, the U.N. said that
as of the end of August, the aver-
age monthly number of incidents
stood at 2,108, up 39 percent over
the same period a year earlier.
It did not provide comparable
data. The figures include insur-
gent attacks as well as assaults
by NATO and Afghan forces on
Taliban figures and positions.
"Armed clashes and impro-
vised explosive devices contin-
ued to constitute the majority of
incidents," U.N. Secretary-Gen-
eral Ban Ki-moon said in his
report. "The south and south-
east of the country, particularly
around the city of Kandahar,
continued to be the focus of mili-
tary activity and accounted for
approximately two-thirds of the
total security incidents."
The U.S.-led coalition said it
disputes the U.N. figures and
planned to hold a news confer-
ence today to release its own sta-
tistics related to overall violence
trends in Afghanistan.
Kandahar, the birthplace of
the Taliban insurgency, was
where most of the 33,000 addi-
tional U.S. troops that President
Barack Obama sent to Afghani-
stan were deployed. The extra
U.S. and other NATO . forces
succeeded in routing insurgents

from their stronghold and now
are trying to hold those areas in
the south.
The militants, however, have
opened new fronts in the north
and west and have stepped up
attacks in the east, including
ones inside the heavily secured
capital, Kabul.
According to the U.N. report,
while the number of suicide
attacks remained steady, insur-
gents conducted more suicide
operations involving multiple
bombers and gunmen. It said
that on average, three complex
attacks have been carried out
each month from January to
August - a 50 percent increase
compared with the same period
last year.
"Complex suicide attacks
made up a greater proportion
of the total number of suicide
attacks," the report said.
Many of these attacks have
taken place in Kabul.
On Aug. 19, Taliban suicide
bombers stormed the British
Council, the U.K.'s international
cultural relations body, killing
eight people duringaneight-hour
firefight as two English language
teachers and their bodyguard
hid in a locked panic room on
the anniversary of the country's
independence from Britain.

President of Haiti plans to
reinstate military presence

Human rights
groups wary of
army's restoration
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) - Haiti's president is mov-
ing forward with a controversial
campaign pledge to restore the
country's disbanded military
with an initial force of 3,500 sol-
diers, according to a document
obtained Tuesday by The Associ-
ated Press.
The role for the army replacing
the former discredited military
would be to patrol Haiti's border,
keep order during times of crisis
and provide opportunities for
young people, says the document
outlining the plan.
President Michel Martelly's
government proposes spending
$95 million to train and equip the
new armed force with the goal of
eventually replacing the 12,000
U.N. peacekeepers in the country.
"The fragility of the Haitian
state now makes it vulnerable to
the risks of internal unrest that
could plunge the country into
anarchy," the document says.
Martelly spokesman Lucien
Jura said Tuesday afternoon that
he was unaware of the document,
and referred questions to security
consultant Reginald Delva, who
told the AP he would comment
later.
Haiti has not had a military
since it was disbanded in 1995
under President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide after years of coups and
human rights abuses. Some Hai-

tians have said in recent months
they welcome the creation of a
new army, a reflection of patrio-
tism but also of the expectation
that it would create jobs in an
impoverished country.
Human rights groups have
expressed uneasiness with the
idea of restoring a military that
was notorious for abuses.
The Martelly administration's
proposal has been circulating
among foreign officials in Haiti
and would need the approval of
Parliament as well as funding
that would likely have to come
from international aid.
The AP obtained the document
from an official on condition of
anonymity because the person
was not authorized to distribute it.
Haiti's government notes in
the report that it does not face
any threat from other countries
but says a new army is necessary
to patrol the porous border with
the Dominican Republic, now fre-
quently used by drug traffickers
and for other types of smuggling.
The budget for the project,
known as the National Council
of Defense and Security, includes
$15 million to compensate for-
mer military personnel who lost
wages and pensions when Aris-
tide disbanded the military. That
is a long-standing grievance of
the former soldiers.
The 22-page proposal says
organizers would initially name
an interim military staff and
identify sites for military bases
in the countryside, with the first
class of troops recruited from
November to January.

The plan also calls for cre-
ation of a "national intelligence
service," a special unit to deal
with terrorism threats, criminal
syndicates and illegal trafficking
networks. It would also moni-
tor "extremist organizations and
movements intended to spread
anarchy."
A U.S. Embassy spokesman,
Jon Piechowski, said by email
that Haitian government officials
had recently met with embassy
personnel to discuss the plan.
"We are reviewing the informh-
tion theyhave shared in support of
their vision," Piechowski said.
A human rights lawyer criti-
cized the idea, noting that the
military has long been used in
Haiti as a tool to quash democrat-
ic movements.
"The problems raised in the
proposal are real, but there is
little basis for believing that the
army would be an effective solu-
tion," said attorney Brian Con-
cannon, director and founder
of the Institute for Justice and
Democracy in Haiti.
"The (army) did not success-
fully defend the borders against
foreign attacks, and the other
listed functions - development,
disaster response and policing
are done more cheaply and effi-
ciently by civilian entities. What
the army has done w611 through-
out its history is attack unarmed
civilians and stunt democracy."
Haiti-born political observer
Jocelyn McCalla said the country
would be better served by creat-
ing a job program thatfocuses on
young people.

E. coli scare leads
son to recall
ground beef

Ohio family
becomes ill after
eating Kroger beef
CINCINNATI (AP) - Tyson
Fresh Meats Inc. is recalling
about 131,300 pounds of ground
beef because a family in Ohio
fell ill after eating meat pro-
duced by the company that was
contaminated with E. coli, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported yesterday.
The recall involves beef sold
as Kroger brands at Kroger Co.
supermarkets; Butcher's Beef
at Food Lion supermarkets; and
generic beef sold to SAV-A-LOT,
Spectrum Foods, Supervalu and
the Defense Commissary Agen-
cy, company spokesman Gary
Mickelson told The Associated
Press.
Tyson produced the affected
meat at its plant in Emporia, Kan.,
on Aug. 23, the USDA said in a
news release.
Four children became ill after
eating the meat with their family
in Butler County, Ohio, in the sec-
ond week of September, said But-
ler County Health Department

director Pat Burg. A 9-year-old
child was hospitalized for about
10 days with severe diarrhea, said
Burg, who declined to release the
family's name.
Ground beef from the family's
home tested positive for the bac-
teria. No other cases have been
reported in the southwest Ohio
county, Burg said.
The Ohio Department of
Health confirmed that two But-
ler County siblings received
medical treatment after becom-
ing sick from E.coli, while other
two children reported to be ill
didn't get medical treatment,
spokeswoman Tessie Pollock
said.
The family told health officials
that they bought the beef at a
Kroger supermarket.
Cincinnati-based Kroger
spokesman Keith Dailey said
the ground beef in question
would have been taken off store
shelves on Sept. 12, because of
when it was produced. He said
Kroger tracked beef to three
geographic divisions where it
was distributed and will have
in-store signs notifying custom-
ers of the recall and details of
the recalled beef.

Problematic panhandling
City officials must help alleviate safety concerns
In the wake of a worrying series of crime alerts the past few
months, students returned to campus this fall with a differ-
ent mindset than in years past. The comfortable atmosphere
in Ann Arbor has been compromised as a result of an increase in
reported sexual assaults - one occurring in the Liberty Street park-
ing structure near many downtown businesses - and noticeably
aggressive panhandling. These changes to the character of down-
town Ann Arbor have many local business owners concerned, and
they fear that safety concerns throughout the Ann Arbor area are
driving away business. The city needs to allocate funds to address
the problem of Ann Arbor safety concerns and support local busi-
nesses and residents.

I can't remember what my life was like
before I had my driver's license. The ineffi-
ciencies of "Michael's mom can drive us there
if we see the 8 o'clock, but my dad can't come
get us until 11..." astound me. Why didn't I just
get in the car and start driving? It's not that
hard. Gas on the left, brakes on the right, fun
all around!
In the same vein, I have no recollection of
my life before Netflix revolutionized it. No,
my memory loss wasn't caused by my exces-
sive methamphetamine usage (though that
does explain my teeth falling out). I must
have blocked the memories of having to get up
and change out the "Golden Girls" disc in the
DVD player for the next one. All that physical
movement - what were we thinking?
It should come as no surprise that we live in
an increasingly digital world. Physical books
are being replaced with e-readers. Money is
no longer paper currency, it's numbers on a
computer screen. Our e-mail inboxes are by
far more useful than our physical mailboxes.
And though Netflix started as a DVD-by-mail
service, its online streaming capabilities have
clearly become the main draw for consum-
ers. With hundreds of thousands of titles to
peruse and watch instantly, DVDs or Blu-ray
discs are simply unnecessary.
Netflix pioneered online streaming and
remains the clear leader in the market. Its
profits continue to rise as competitors dwin-
dle. According to some estimates, 20 percent
of peak-hours Internet traffic is Netflix users.
Still, recent controversial business decisions
leave room for speculation if Netflix can
retain its crown.
Netflix stock reached an impressive $300
in July. Then, in a surprise announcement,
monthly subscription prices were significant-
lyraised. The movegarnered noticeable media
attention, along with Starz and Sony drop-
ping content from Netflix's streaming library.
Perhaps as a result of the hype surroundingit,
rather than the price change itself, Netflix's
stock price plummeted - currently valued at
$127 - and approximately 1 million out of 25

million customers canceled their subscrip-
tions. The mass exodus of customers and dra-
matic stock price drop prompted Netflix CEO
Reed Hastings to apologize to consumers. An
apology, but no price reduction.
Last week, in a substantially less publi-
cized move, Netflix announced in a short post
in their blog that the company would be split
in two. Netflix will continue operating as an
online streaming service, and the DVD-by-
mail service will spin off into a new company:
Qwikster. So, if you want to continue getting
movies in the mail and streaming online, you
now have to deal with two websites, twq com-
panies and two prices. Customers were upset,
and stock prices continued to drop. Despite
the obvious backlash against the two-compa-
ny confusion, it's obvious why Netflix made
this decision.
DVDs, Blu-rays and any physical media are
going by the wayside. They're not gone yet,
but looking at the music industry as an exam-
ple, it's easy to see a not-too-distant future
when all of our media is web-based. Netflix
knows this. It knows that the DVD side of its
business isn't viable in the long run. And with
the rapidly changing technology market, "the
long run" could be less than three years away.
Hastings and Co. didn't want the shrinking
DVD market to kill their streaming empire by
bringing the whole company down.
The stock price drop and customer loss
were a large price to pay, but they probably
saved the business. With an innocuous name
like Qwikster, Hastings seemed to be prepar-
ing for the inevitable failure of the spin-off
brand. When the DVD market dies for good
in three, five, or even 10 years, Netflix can
quietly kill Qwikster without dramatically
upsetting Netflix investors.
Despite ups and downs, it appears Netflix
has the brains to evolve with the market. And
thank goodness, because a life without Netf-
lix hardly seems worth living.

For those who attended University President Mary
Sue Coleman's sustainability speech on Tuesday,
many things were made clear. For one, I was finally
convinced of her existence, and the audience was con-
vinced of the University's strong and growing commit-
ment to sustainability.
"Sustainability" gets thrown around quite a bit,
especially in an eco-conscious town like Ann Arbor;
its overuse often leads to a softening of its meaning.
However, Coleman made it abundantly clear to all
those in attendance that sustainability isn't a mere
buzz word but a deep, underlying theme that's to guide
this University into the future. "I want this message to
be clear," Coleman asserted, "Sustainability drives the
University of Michigan. Combine maize and blue, and
you get green."
The goals the University has set are commendable,
highly attainable and are large enough in scope to
truly make an impact. Among the goals Coleman enu-
merated were a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse
gas emissions, a 40 percent reduction of waste sent to
landfills, the use of 40 percent fewer chemicals to treat
grass and trees around campus and the transformation
of the University bus fleet to hybrid vehicles.
All these changes are scheduled to be fully imple-
mented by 2025, and judging by Coleman's Hoke-like
resolve and steel-like gaze, I have no doubt she meant
every single word she said.
However, the eventual success or failure of these
ambitious plans lies not in firmly pressed pantsuits or
paraphrasing ubiquitous Hoke-isms but squarely in the
laps of all Michigan students, regardless of year or con-
centration. In order for sustainability to truly take hold
at the University, it must become a part of campus life,
not just a message preached to us by the administra-
tion. As current students, we all have a deep obligation
to begin to alter the way the student body thinks and

acts in relation to the natural world. Just like Denard
Robinson's dreads are the source of his speed, the stu-
dent body is the source of the University's vitality. Col-
lectively, we have the power to take the University in
any direction we choose. All we need to do is "plant
(the) seeds of ideas" and "forge new trails."
The continued development and expansionof student
groups committed to various areas of campus and global ,
sustainability is a sign that students are beginning to
realize their enormous potential to bring about change
on campus and in the community we love. In addition
to the numerous student organizations' that already
exist, Coleman announced the formation of a $50,000
annual "Planet Blue student fund," which will be used
to support the best and most innovative student-devel-
oped campus sustainability ideas. We not only have the
dreams and the plans, but we now have the money to
make it happen. Anyone who thinks they don't have
ample opportunities to become involved with sustain-
ability on this campus and to truly make a difference is
as blind as the Ohio State NCAA compliance office.
It's imperative that students seek out the opportu-
nities that exist all around them. Even the smallest
change for good, when done on a scale as large as the
University of Michigan, has enormous potential to
bring about real, tangible results. So, fellow students,
I implore you all to seriously consider your everyday
actions and reflect on the ramifications these actions
have on the local and global environment. We sit here
today with the tremendous opportunity to direct our
University in a direction few, if any, other universities
across the country, or across the globe for that matter,
can achieve. We have a duty to ourselves, to future gen-
erations, and as Wolverines, to seize this opportunity
and bring our University into a new era.

Michigan red-zone package tough to defend

Offense a perfect
13-for-13 scoring
inside the
20-yard line
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
offense is a perfect 13-for-13 in
red-zone conversions through
four games this season.
There, the secret's out.
"Why do you say that?" said
Michigan offensive coordinator
Al Borges, when reminded of the
red-zone success. "Doggone it.
It's just like that kiss of death,
OK?"
OK then.
The Wolverines, led by junior
quarterback Denard Robinson,
have scored 12 red-zone touch-
downs, tearing up defenses for
the nation's second-leading red-
zone touchdown percentage
(92.3).
But that success is nothing
new. Michigan's identical 4-0
starts the past three seasons
have been due in large part to
the offense's success inside the
20-yard line.
In 2010, Robinson tortured
defenses in the opening four
games to the tune of 18-for-19
in red-zone conversions with 12
touchdowns.
The Wolverinesnevergotclose
to those numbers in the previ-
ous three seasons under former
quarterbacks Chad Henne, Ste-
ven Threet, Nick Sheridan and
Tate Forcier. The 2007-09 totals
through four games were 10, six
and 10 touchdowns respectively,
for touchdown percentages of

66.7, 60.0 and 62.5.
Clearly, Denard Robinson
makes a difference. But he's not
the only factor in the red-zone
equation.
"I don'tknow if there's a magi-
cal answer," Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said. "I mean, I think
part of it is always you have some
pretty good luck."
Even with one of the nation's
most-feared rushers handling
the ball at quarterback, Michi-
gan hasn't favored spreading out
the field to open running lanes in
enemy territory.
Inside the red zone, Borges
has called in what Hoke referred
to as "jumbo personnel" - I-back
sets and three tight ends stacked
up close to the line of scrimmage
in a classic goal-line look.
Facing the red-zone offense
in practice seems to have helped
defensive coordinator Greg Mat-
tison's defense. The unit has
allowed just seven scores on 13
red-zone attempts this season,
with just five touchdowns.
The Wolverines have the low-
est opponent red-zone conver-
sion percentage (53.9) in the Big
Ten and the eighth-lowest in the
nation.
"Some offenses you can really
get a tendency on," Mattison said.
"And you can just say, in this per-
sonnel group they're going to do
this, and in this personnel group
they're going to do this.
"Coach Borges, now, if you're
playing against him, just when
you think they may run it, he's
going to throw it. Just when you
think that he's goingto be in this,
he's going to spread out and be in
that. I think that it's because he's
so sound in every group, where
some teams aren't."
The goal-line tenacity is

TERRA MOLLt
Junior quarterback Denard Robinson and the Michigan offense have come away with at least three points on every red-zone possession this season.

emphasized in practice, where
the offense and defense square
off inside the red zone everyday.
"One thing I'll say for this
football team - we are not per-
feet by any means, 'we are not
there - but we've got pretty
good will," Borges said. "A lot of
times, teams don't have a great
will and you tend to fold. We've
shown no signs of that. Not yet,
anyway."
Michigan's 4-0 start will be
tested against Minnesota on Sat-
urday. But if you're going by the

numbers, Robinson should have
his way with the defense.
When backed into the red
zone, the Goldon Gophers have
allowed 14 scores on 16 chances.
That spells a busy day for Min-
nesota.
"(The red zone) is a point of
emphasis," Borges said. "There's
nothing more distressing than
getting the ball down there and
not scoring. And you're not going
to score a touchdown every time,
but you're not coming away with
something."

They're not perfect in his eyes,
but they've been perfect in the
red zone.
"There you go again," Borges
said, laughing.
NOTES: Gophers coach Jerry
Kill, who was admitted to the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
on Sunday after suffering a sei-
zure earlier in the day, returned
to practice Wednesday.
The first-year coach has had a
seizure disorder for nearly two
decades.
It caused him to collapse dur-

ing a game against New Mexico
State earlier this year.
"I ain't changing," Kill said
after his return from his first
seizure. "What the hell am I
supposed to do? Stop? I mean,
sit in the chair and wait for the
next God-dang seizure to come
along?"
He hasn't stopped. Kill was
back in practice and defensive
coordinator Tracy Claeys said
Tuesday that he expects Kill
to coach the Big Ten opener at
Michigan Stadium on Saturday.

Congress shutdown
due to disagreement
about disaster relief

A

FEMA only has
enough emergency
funding to last
through the week
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Congress is once again allow-
ing shutdown politics to bring
the federal government to the
brink of closing.
For the second time in nine
months, lawmakers are bicker-
ing and posturing over spend-
ing plans. The difference this
time is that everyone agrees on
the massive barrel of money to
keep the government running
for another seven weeks.
"It is embarrassing," Sen.
Mark Warner, D-Va., admit-
ted Sunday on CNN's "State
of the Union." Warner asked:
"Can we, once again, inflict on
the country and the American
people the spectacle of a near
government shutdown?"
At issue is a small part of
the almost $4 trillion budget
intended for an infrequent pur-
pose: federal dollars to help
victims of floods, hurricanes,
tornadoes and other natural
disasters and whether some of
the expense should be offset
by cuts in other governrent

spending.
This sort of crisis man-
agement has cost Congress
credibility in the eyes of the
electorate, with about eight in
10 Americans disapproving of
the institution's performance
after this summer's debt crisis.
A major credit agency down-
graded the nation's ratings as
a result, unnerving the world's
financial markets.
FEMA estimates that as of
Monday morning, it had $114
million left in its disaster relief
account, enough to last until
Thursday or Friday, said agen-
cy spokeswoman Rachel Racu-
sen. That is a couple of days
longer than FEMA estimated
last week, which an agency
official attributed to unused
money FEMA has been able to
reclaim from grants to states
for recovery projects that have
been completed.
Those extra days are signifi-
cant because that means FEMA
may not need additional money
to function until Saturday,
when the government's new
fiscal year begins. That takes
some pressure off House and
Senate leaders who have been
unable to strike a compromise
on a bill providing disaster
relief and financing the govern-
ment until mid-November.

A police car sits in the driveway of the home of 26-year-old Rezwan Ferdaus, in Ashland, Mass., yesterday. Ferdaus has been arrested and accused of plttint to destroy

Man accused of attack

Suspect allegedly
discussed
terror plot with
undercover agent
BOSTON (AP) - A Massachu-
setts man was arrested yesterday
and accused of plotting an assault
on the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol
using remote-controlled aircraft
armed with explosives - the lat-
est of several terrorism cases to
spring from federal sting opera-
tions.
Rezwan Ferdaus was arrested
in Framingham after undercover
federal agents delivered materi-
als he had' allegedly requested,
including grenades, six machine
guns and what he believed was 24
pounds of C-4 explosive. Federal
officials said the public was never
in danger from the explosives,
which it said were always under
control and closely monitored.
Yesterday's arrest was similar

to other cases in which reput-
ed would-be terrorists were
caught in sting operations that
revolved around fictional plots
against various targets, such as
Dallas skyscapers or a Chicago
nightclub. In this case, though,
authorities say Ferdaus planned
the scheme.
According to a federal affi-
davit, Ferdaus, 26, of Ashland,
became convinced America was
evil through jihadi websites
and videos, and began planning
"jihad" against the U.S. in early
2010. He contacted a federal
informant that December and
months later, allegedly began
meeting to discuss the plot with
undercover federal agents he
believed were members of al-
Qaida.
Ferdaus said he wanted to deal
a psychological blow to the "ene-
mies of Allah" by hitting the Pen-
tagon, which he called "head and
heart of the snake," according to
the affidavit.
"Allah has given us the privi-

lege," he allegedly told the infor-
mant. "... He punishes them by
our hand. We're the ones."
Ferdaus, a U.S, citizen who
graduated from Northeastern
University with a bachelor's
degree in physics, made a brief
initial appearance yesterday
in federal court on charges of
attempting to destroy federal
buildings and providing sup-
port to a foreign terrorist orga-
nization, in this case al-Qaida. A
detention hearing was scheduled
for Monday.
Telephone messages were left
at the office of his attorney, Cath-
erine Byrne, and at the address
listed for Ferdaus in the affidavit.
Several alleged domestic plots
have been thwarted since the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,
including in Lackawanna, N.Y.;
Portland, Ore.; and Virginia.
Terrorism arrests involving
federal stings have often been
followed by claims of entrap-
ment, but none of the cases
brought since Sept. 11 has been

thrown out by a court on such
grounds.
U.S. Rep. William Keating of
Massachusetts, a member of the
Homeland Security Commit-
tee, said lawmakers have been
warned for months of an emerg-
ing threat from homegrown
extremists. He said al- Qaida
is casting a wide net to radical-
ize individuals or small groups
already in the country because of
the significant advantages.
"They're already here, so they
don't have the hurdles of getting
into the country, they know the
country better.... They know how
to move around," Keating said.
"The testimony we heard, things
like this (the Ferdaus arrest)
were inevitable."
Ferdaus is accused of planning
to use three remote control air-
planes measuring about from 60 to
80 inches in length. Ferdaus alleg-
edly planned to pack five pounds
of explosives in each plane, while
saving some of it to blow up bridg-
es near the Pentagon.

AL-HASHIMI
From Page 1A
magnetic resonance allows Al-
Hashimi, who is the University's
Robert L. Kuczkowski profes-
sor of chemistry, to see how the
atoms and nucleic acid move in
three dimensions.
"The advantage of using this
nuclear magnetic resonance
method is that in principle, it can
provide us with insight as to how
the atoms jiggle and wiggle and
not just the static arrangement
of how they look in a structure,"
he said.
By getting a detailed picture of
the atoms "dancing," AI-Hashimi
said he and his team examined
the RNA molecule for HIV and
identified the compound that can
stop HIV replication. Al-Hashi-
mi compared the imaging meth-
od to identifying the proper lock
or molecule shape, so research-
ers can determine which key or
drug can unlock it.
"By imaging the whole image
of the lock ... we increase our
chances of finding the key," he
said.
This method of imaging can

also be applied to finding the
proper drug to combat multiple
diseases found in RNA including
cancer and Alzheimer's.
As his experiment progresses,
Al-Hashimi said he would like
to begin imaging larger pieces of
the cell and eventually take 3-D
images of the entire cell in order
to see large-scale movements.
The goal, Al-Hashimi said, is to
make a movie of a cell and anoth-
er of a drug interacting with the
cell.
"It's a big game changer," he
said.
Al-Hashimi said he found out
about his Popular Science award
in an e-mail and was honored to
hear that he was selected.
"It's wonderful to be recog-
nized," he said. "It's great to
share this with my students and
collaborators."
Al-Hashimi said the Univer-
sity community, including his
wife, Allison Aiello, the John G.
Searle assistant professor of epi-
demiology in the School of Pub-
lic Health, has encouraged his
work.
"It's nice to be at the Univer-
sity of Michigan where you're in
a very supportive environment,"

Al-Hashimi said.
Al-Hashimi added that he
also received support from LSA,
as the college purchased more
space for his research expan-
sion. In turn, Al-Hashimi said he
likes to use his research to better
engage his students.
"I love teaching and I often
try to mix (research and teach-
ing) together," he said. "I have
lots of undergraduate students,
for example, doing my research
and learning science by doing
science at the lab, and it's a nice
compliment to the lecture mate-
rial."
When he teaches about ele-
ments, for example, Al-Hashi-
mi doesn't teach the concept
abstractly. Instead, he likes to
focus on one or two elements
that he's currently researching
to make a more interesting and
concrete connection for stu-
dents. Al-Hashimi added that he
also makes an effort to have an
undergraduate student work on
each of his academic papers.
"I often in the lectures talk
about science from a research
perspective ... I present the
material in a way that a scientist
might think about it," he said.

cancer screening until it saved
her life.
"I was very lucky that I had
an excellent OB/GYN who
explained to me that pap smears
were a necessity to me once
a year, and I was obedient, so
I did that," she said. "But the
truth is I knew pap smears were
important, but I wasn't exactly
sure what they were for. Then it
turned out that this pap smear
was positive for cervical cancer."
Hope Haefner, a professor in
the Department of Obstetrics

cal School, said having access
to and knowledge about cervi-
cal cancer tests can be the dif-

estimated to cost $5.5 million.
The $2.7 million grant will be
divided into $1.013 million for
improvements to Blake Transit
Center and $1.697 million for the
cost of the 10 hybrid buses.
The $2.7 million is part of
the $4.195 million that has been
allocated to AATA for the proj-
ect thus far. In Oct. 2010, AATA
received a $1 million federal
grant for the Blake Transit Cen-
ter renovation. AATA has also
applied for an additional federal
grant to aid the project.

Ford's success stirs UAW
resentment in labor talks

Union employees
looking to get
raises, bonuses
DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -
Ford's turnaround over the last
five years has resulted in big
profits and won its CEO a repu-
tation for brilliant management.
But those same achievements
are stirring resentment among
many of its factory workers. And
that is complicating contract
talks between the company and
its union employees.
At The Rouge, Ford's massive,
94-year-old factory complex in
Dearborn, Mich., there's talk
along the assembly lines of win-
ning back raises and bonuses
lost when the company was near
 financial collapse in 2007. Work-
ers, who assemble F-150 pickup
trucks at the site, are upset that
Ford is trying to cut labor costs,
especially after nine straight
profitable quarters and a $26.5
million pay package for CEO
Alan Mulally.
A few miles to the north, inside
Ford's 13-story headquarters
known as the Glass House, exec-
utives are worried because work-
ers, on average, cost the company
$58 an hour in pay and benefits,
the highest in U.S. auto industry.
Both sides are trying to find
a compromise this week while
work continues at Ford factories
under a contract extension. A top
union bargainer told workers on
a telephone recording Monday
night that talks are accelerating
and he is "hopefully optimistic"
a deal can be reached this week.
Ford's profits and the possi-
bility of a strike could force the
company into a deal that's more
generous to workers than the one
already negotiated with General
Motors Co. Chrysler, meanwhile,

continues to negotiate its own
contract with the union.
Differences between Ford and
the union date to 2007, when all
three Detroit automakers were
on the verge of financial ruin.
The year before that, Ford lost
$12.6 billion, and U.S. sales were
down 8 percent. Worried that
the company would collapse,
Ford workers began a series of
givebacks.
Like workers at GM and Chrys-
ler, they eventually gave up cost-
of-living pay raises, performance
bonuses and other benefits. GM
and Chrysler needed government
bailouts and bankruptcy protec-
tion to stay in business, but Ford
took billions in private loans and
endured on its own.
As a result, Ford became a
consumer favorite and the com-
pany prospered. It paid Mulally
for engineering the turnaround
and restored merit pay and some
other benefits for white-collar
workers, angering union, mem-
bers.
"The compensation for the
CEO has been widely publi-
cized, and those kinds of things
wend their way up and down the
assembly line," says Harley Shai-
ken, a professor at the University
of California at Berkeley and a
specialist in labor issues. "It cre-
ates higher expectations."
At Ford, bargainers are expect-
ed to use the deal with GM as a
template. But it's unclear if its
provisions will be acceptable to
Ford or its union workers. Under
the deal, GM workers would get
a $5,000 bonus for ratifying the
contract, more profit sharing and
higher pay for entry-level work-
ers. Although the deal has no pay
raise for most workers, it appears
headed for approval.
It's the lack of raises that has
rankled many of Ford's 41,000
factory workers.

"Ford has to do a lot more,"
says Gary Walkowicz, a worker
at the company's Dearborn plant,
the epicenter of union dissent.
Walkowicz says many work-
ers are ready to strike, especially
in Dearborn. Workers there led
the rest of the company in reject-
ing a round of concessions in
2009. Ford sought the conces-
sions to match deals given to GM
and Chrysler as they were going
through bankruptcy protection.
Ford is the only Detroit auto-
maker where the union can
strike, something it has not done
at Ford since 1976. Walkouts over
pay are banned this year at GM
and Chrysler Group LLC under
the terms of their government
bailouts. At Ford plants, workers
are making picket schedules in
case they need to strike. But get-
ting ready is standard procedure
during contract talks.
Gary Chaison, a professor of
labor relations at Clark Univer-
sity in Worcester, Mass., says
Ford can cut the risk of a strike
if it doesn't stray too far from the
GM contract. But if Ford tries for
big labor cost cuts, the odds of a
strike rise to 50-50, he says.
UAW President Bob King has
said he's not thinking about a
strike. But he thinks workers
should get a piece of the profits
because they have each given
up $7,000 to $30,000 a year in
concessions since 2007. He also
has called Mulally's pay "outra-
geous."
Mulally, in a recent inter-
view, defended his compensa-
tion, saying it was determined
by the company's success and
the free market. He said much
of his pay is "at risk" because it
comes in stock that can rise and
fall in price based on Ford's per-
formance. Mulally's salary is $1.4
million, with the rest coming in
stock and a bonus.

8A - Thursday September 29 2011 The MicIgnDiy-mcgaalco


The new Kirkland & Ellis Caf, located in the Law School's Hutchins Hall, opened earlier this month.

APPS
From Page 1A
the user's location using GPS and
can emit a high-pitched alarm to
deter anyone who appears to be a
threat.
University alum Marsha New-
man, president of AMP, LLC - the
company that operates OnCall
Defender - said the app also has
a stealth mode, which can be used
in situations when speaking might
be dangerous.Throughthestealth
mode, the app sends information
to OnCall Defender's monitor-
ing station at the touch of a but-
ton. OnCall Defender's licensed
monitoring station then contacts
authorities and passes on the
user's information.
"A lot of times in an emergen-
cy situation you're not in a posi-
tion to say, 'I feel uncomfortable
with this guy,"' Newman said.
"It has particular relevance on
campus because you can do the
stealth mode, you don't have to
get parents involved, (and) you
don't have to get anyone else
involved."
In light of the recent assaults
in Ann Arbor and attempted
robberies on campus, Marsha'
and her husband Fred Newman,
also a University alum and CEO
of AMP, LLC, said they hope
students with iPhones will use
the mobile app. Marsha said
she believes OnCall Defender is
faster and more efficient than
callingt911 and, like a home alarm

system, the monitoring station
immediately knows who's call-
ing.
"The main goal is for people
to protect themselves - to have
a monitored emergency security
system," Marsha said.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the University's Department
of Public Safety, said though she
is unfamiliar with the mobile
app, she believes calling 911is the
"most effective way to get help."
Brown suggested that stu-
dents use the Blue Light Emer-
gency Phone System on campus
or text DPS in situations when
speaking aloud is difficult.
The OnCall Defender mobile
app is free to download, but
iPhone users pay a subscrip-
tion fee of $6.99 per month for a
year-long subscription or $11.99
for month-to-month service. A
similar mobile app, MyForce,
is compatible with the iPhone,
BlackBerry and Android. While
it costs the same for amooth-long
subscription, it is more expensive
than OnCall Defender for a year-
long subscription at $119.
Similar to OnCall Defender,
the MyForce program has cus-
tomers register personal infor-
mation and upload a picture of
themselves. MyForce also uses a
GPS tracking system that helps
local police departments find the
reportee when the distress signal
is sent.
The main difference between
the two apps is that MyForce also
records the incident once the dis-

tress signal is sent. According to
the MyForce website, the com-
pany aims to serve as an alterna-
tive to blue light phones and to
provide users with an additional
emergency and safety resource.
"Wherever students are on
campus when they send their
alert from their smartphone, you
get an instant alert notification
in an emergency, alleviating the
student's need to find a blue-light
phone," the MyForce website
states.
According to the MyForce
Facebook page, the company
has a current three-month free
promotion because September is
National Campus Safety Aware-
ness Month.
LSA junior Kelly Lenkevich
said she is unfamiliar with the
mobile apps and doesn't feel the
need to pay for the services.
"I don't feel threatened enough
for it to be a worthwhile invest-
ment," Lenkevich said.
However, Lenkevich added
that this kind of mobile app might
be a good resource in an emer-
gency.
"If you're in a situation, you
can't always take the time to call
911," she said.
Similarly, LSA junior DeJone
Miles said she is not interested
in paying for a safety mobile app
service, though she supports
their purpose to increase stu-
dent safety. She said if a similar
and free smartphone application
were available, she would con-
sider using it.

CAFE

priced," Pizana said. "We hope to
gain thetrust of the students, that
they can come here and not feel
that we're taking more money out
of their pockets than whatthey're
already putting into the school."
Pizana added that the Kirkland
& Ellis Caf6 uses local ingredients
- including produce from East-
ern Market in Detroit - and sells
homemade goods.
"We have a bakery out of
Detroit that we use that brings
in fresh muffins and donuts and
(other products)," Pizana said.
"We also provide our own fresh
baked goods: scones, cookies, rice
krispie treats, brownies - that
sort of thing we all take care of in
house here."
The cafe also imports Star-
bucks coffee. But Pizana said
the caf6 offers the full Starbucks
menu at a slightly cheaper price
than the franchise's stores.
"We'd done our research, and
Starbucks was what we felt was
wanted by the people that both go
to school here and study and then
also the people around town,"
Pizana said.
The opening of the Kirkland &
Ellis Cafe was on Sept.-7 around
the same time as the closing of
the Law Library's snack bar, a
small cafe previously located on
the library's lower level. Though

Pizana recognizes that the snack
bar was a popular choice for
many students, he said he hopes
the new cafe can fill the snack
bar's void.
"We've been well accepted due
to the change with the snack bar
downstairs," Pizana said. "A few
people had mixed feelings about
it, but now that we've been up
and running and we've strived
for customer service and gained
those customers on a one-on-one
level ... I think we've kind of won
them over with our caf6 and the
products that we serve."
Business at the cafe has been
going well during its first three
weeks, Pizana said. He added that
the Sept. 7 grand opening ceremo-
ny of the Robert B. Aikens Com-
mons increased the number of
students and staff visitingthe cafe.
The business is also in the
process of setting up a system
to accept Blue Bucks, but Pizana
said he hopes the caf6's cus-
tomer demographic will expand
beyond Law School students and
staff.
"We are really hoping that the
public finds out about us - people
passing through from classes,
people passing through to work,"
Pizana said.
Pizana said he believes the
personal'nature of the caf6, along
with the quality of food it serves,
will draw customers.
"You can go into any caf6 and
get a sandwich, but the experi-

ence, I think, is what brings peo-
ple back," Pizana said. "We are
very personable here. We make
it an effort for everyone, not just
our cooks but our cashiers, to
know our customers on a person-
al basis."
First year Law School student
Elisabeth Madden said she has
been to the cafe everyday since
it opened and finds the location a
convenient stop between classes.
"We have a lot of one-hour
breaks in our classes, so it's not
really enough time to go home,"
Madden said. "So it's'nice to have
a place to be able to sit down and
have a snack or coffee."
First year Law School student
Laura Jacobson said she also fre-
quents .the new cafe and enjoys
the salads, sandwiches and muf-
fins. She added that the snack bar
was "awful," and she doesn't miss
it, even if products at the new cafe
are slightly more expensive.
"I know everything at the
snack bar was like a dollar or two,
but it's really not that expensive
(at the Kirkland & Ellis Cafe),"
Jacobson said.
Madden also said the new cafe
is an improvement over the snack
bar and offers a better space for
students.
"It's a nice place to kick back
after class and relax and see
friends, but it's also quiet enough
that it's a good place to study and
get ready for the class you have
the next day," Madden said.

M useuin The word
soon as it leaves your
lips, like Grecian col-
umns with straight-backed arches
and gilded chandeliers slinking
along the walls of the Louvre and the
Hermitage. It suggests impenetrabil-
ity. A slight, sneering inaccessibility.
Behind the exhibit is a sea of ster-
ile white. Objects and viewers are
divided by glass. Museums make us
uncomfortable, forcing us to. recon-
cile with the fact that the things we
have created can have a standing life
much, much longer than the human
race does.
Perspective plays a large role
in creating these biases, wheth-
er they're from a terrible child-
hood vacation or a grouchy curator
screaming at you to stay at least 10
feet awayfromthe exhibit. But muse-
ums are organic, living, changing
institutions. And each of the seven
public museums at the University -
the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology,
the University of Michigan Muse-
um of Art, the Sindecuse Museum
of Dentistry, the Exhibit Museum
of Natural History, the Matthaei
Botanical Gardens, the Nichols
Arboretum and the Detroit Obser-
vatory - challenges this definition
in several ways. Ultimately, these
establishments merely act as tools
of our self-signification, and what a
museum has to present has more to
do with what society expects from it
than what it expects of society.

The age of collecting
Though the relationship between
people and things has existed since
the beginning of time, the 18th-cen-
tury aesthetic of curatorial thought
was what gave rise to the modern
museum. The artists and painters of
the Age of Exploration viewed the
way their minds worked very much
like the collections they maintained
- fabulous collections that ranged
from rare butterflies to old coins,
botanical specimens to "suckling
pigs" (as Foucault introduced in his
preface to "The Order of Things") -
and ascribed a separate meaning to
the items they assembled and took
out of circulation. These collections
were eventually displayed to the
public and deemed "cabinets of curi-
osity."
"Youhave people traveling all over
the world, things coming to Europe,
things people had never seen before,"
said Prof. Ray Silverman, director of
the Museum Studies program at the
University. "And people admiring
them and putting them into these
rooms - jam-packed, creating these
incredible spectacles."
Context, the cloud of classifica-
tion that surrounds an object and
influences people's expectations of
it, evolved a little later. Darwin and
his contemporaries ushered in the
Age of Reason and influenced its
corresponding practices: grouping
the objects into taxonomies, being

FOOD WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
FALAFEL

COURTESYOFVERAYU AND DAVID LI

PITA PIT
615 East University Avenue
Service is fast, but prices are a bit steep.
Meat costs extra and this addition brings
the falafel to more than $8, while the veg-
etarian option plays around $6. The ingre-
dients lack pizzazz; they don't embrace
one another. The result is a pita of Philly
cheese steak, hummus and pickled vegeta-
bles that sit in your mouth but never blend
to make something greater.
OASIS
1106 South University Avenue
At Oasis, the falafel itself - the little
fried spheres of heaven incarnate - are
clearly cooked with a carefully seasoned
touch. While the wrap in totality could
use a little less tahini and a bit more fla-
vor, the crispy chickpea shells and the
crunchy pickles come together to bring
the dish to a new scrumptous textural
level.

PITA KABOB
619 East William Street
Pita Kabob knows what falafel is. It's fast
food - no matter how you slice it - and
here, they embrace it. Deep fried falafel
balls, lathered in the patron's choice of
excellent hummus or baba ghanouj (at no
extra charge, too!), and garnished with
pickled parsnips so that every bite is as
savory and flavorful as the last. And all this
deliciousness at only $4.89? Not bad at all.
LA MARSA
301 South State Street
La Marsa's falafel comes in a warm,
crispy pita with yogurt sauce, tomatoes, let-
tuce and pickles. The consistency is flawless
with the crunch of the pita, the crispy fried
goodness of the falafel and the fluffiness of
the delicious chickpea inside. There is also
a surprising cilantro-lime taste that coats
the falafel, giving it a zesty flavor. At first
bite, the tastes blend harmoniously.

Why do you think people like wearing creative things on their

To get in touch with their creative side. I think for a lot of people, it's
kind of repressed, but I think everybody has something to offer.

A head for fashion Manufacturing nostalgia

'U' students are
making an age-old
tradition their own
By ERIN STEELE
Daily Arts Writer
In a fashion industry where
avant-garde is the name of the
game and style icons like Lady
Gaga parade around in scandal-
ous outfits made out of every-
thing from stuffed animals to raw
meat, dressing according to a rel-
atively conservative set of rules
may be thought to stifle one's cre-
ativity. But Muslim students at
the University are demonstrating
the exact opposite.
Verse 33:59 in the Shakir trans-
lation of the Qur'an - "O Proph-
et! Say to your wives and your
daughters and the women of the
believers that they let down upon
them their over-garments; this
will be more proper, that they
may be known, and thus they will
not be given trouble" - explains
the idea behind hijab, an Islamic
style of dress that promotes mod-
esty among both women and
men. Those who choose to wear
hijab are to cover their heads
and wear loose, non-transparent
clothing with long sleeves and
pant legs or skirts.
While followers of Islam have
different beliefs about the tech-
nicalities - whether feet are
allowed to be shown or whether
women have to cover their entire
face - the underlying principle is
the same for all.
"It's about the modesty and
how you carry yourself," said
political science doctorate stu-
dent and former hijab fashion
blogger Imaan Ali. "Men, for
example, they're not supposed to
wear something shorter than to
their knee."
The hijab, according to Asso-
ciate Professor of Near Eastern
Studies Mohommad Alhawary, is
described in the Qur'an as a way
of allowing people, especially
women, to actively participate in
society and maintain separation
of the public and private spheres.

about the very recently thriving

"You see now in social net-
works, Facebook and other
places - people have no separa-
tion," Alhawary said. "They get
in trouble whether with them-
selves, with their peers (or) with
their employers because there's
no observance of separation in
private life and public life."
Over thousands of years,
observers of hijab have used their
creativity to dress themselves
according to worldly trends with-
out violatingthe rules set forth by
the Qur'an.
Ali began wearing hijab at 20
years old, a fashion-conscious
age for many. A fan of H&M and
Forever 21 scarves, she follows
the latest runway collections for
inspiration.
"You can kind of modify and
make the trends (to) what you
want to wear," she said. "You
have to use your imagination.
It was really a challenge at the
start."
Ali also said hijab styles vary
widely across all Muslim coun-
tries. Generally, women in the

Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain,
Qatar and Kuwait) tend to wear
long black dresses and cover
everything but their eyes, while
women in Egypt and the Levant
(a region including most of Leba-
non, Syria, Jordan, Israel and
the Palestinian Territories) wear
more colorful scarves and expose
their faces.
"You can tell where people are
from based on how they tie their
scarves," Ali said. "Lately, the
borders are a little bit smudged.
I wear this one day, I wear the
Spanish (scarf) another day. It's
totally up to you. You use your
imagination. It takes some prac-
tice to know what looks good and
what doesn't make you look really
weird."
Alhawary cites Turkey as one
of the largest current influences
in hijab fashion, saying this is
likely due to the country's recent
secularization and people's
attempts to maintain the hijab in
a less jarring way.

D ''BOY MEETS WORLD' (1993-2000), ABC
Good friends, young love, wise mentors in 'Boy Meets World'

By PROMA KHOSL A
Daily TV/New Media Editor
You call yourself a '90s kid?
Let's put that to the test: "When
this boy meets wooorld ..." Did
you start singing in your head (or
out loud)? Did you feel that inter-
nal leap of joy associated with the
start of an episode of "Boy Meets
World?" Congratulations. You
have enough taste to recognize
one of the greatest sitcoms ever.
Of course, even those of us now
in college - in our humble opin-
ion, the last of the true '90s kids
- were probably still too young to
catch "Boy Meets World" when
it first aired during the T.G.I.F.
block of Friday night program-
ming on ABC. Chances are, you
fell in love with Cory, Shawn,
Topanga and Eric once the show
went into syndication on the Dis-
ney Channel around 1999. Since
its conclusion a year later, "Boy
Meets World" has become the
cult favorite of a generation.
"Boy Meets World" began in
1993, during the golden age of
situation comedies. It was born

of the wholesome family humor
and hilarious teen shenanigans
that infuse other beloved sit-
coms of the decade, like "Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air" and "Sabrina
the Teenage Witch." Young Cory
Matthews (Ben Savage) deals
with the daily ups and downs of
high school, family and romance.
Nothing earth-shattering. Then
why is it so damn good?
Watching a show more than 10
years since it ended is an excel-
lent way to test its merit. (Warn-
ing: "Captain Planet" doesn't hold
up.) "Boy Meets World" was to its
television contemporaries what
"30 Rock" is today: individualis-
tic and downright weird.
There's a scene that exempli-
fies this, during season three's "I
Was a Teenage Spy," the episode
in which Cory dreams he's in
1957. During the scene in ques-
tion, he goes home only to find
Tom Bosley and Anson Williams
of "Happy Days" eating brownies
in the kitchen. It's utterly bizarre
- then and now - but that doesn't
stop it from being hilarious.

main cast shares in his classroom.
Alongside the usual sitcom
fare, "Boy Meets World" tackled
its fair share of topical subjects.
Among the episodes that never
aired on the Disney channel is
one in which Cory and Shawn go
on a drinking binge as Cory copes
with his break-up. Yet another
sees Cory and Topanga planning
to sleep together after senior
prom. Though there is little talk
of race or religion, there is a con-
stant theme of social class strug-
gles that comes to the forefront at
least once a season. All these epi-
sodes choose the altruistic route
- no more drinking, wait until
marriage, don't judge people -
without the preachy voice of, say,
"Full House."
The show's greatest strength is
the sheer perfection of Cory and
Shawn's friendship. Best of bud-
dies before Harry and Ron; a bro-
mance to rival Turk and JD; the
boys meeting the world. They are
unfailingly loyal to one another
throughout the most turbulent
years of their young lives when
siblings, parents and girlfriends

prove unpredictable. They dress
in drag, pee on a cop car, spend
a night.sleeping in Splash Moun-
tain and always come to school to
sit in the same desks, one in front
of the other.
It's best summed up by the
boys themselves in the season
four episode "Easy Street": "Why
are we on the ground?" Cory asks,
after the duo mistakes a backfir-
ing car for a gunshot. "Because
it's fun," replies Shawn. "And we
do everything together."
A decade later, with the final
season comingto DVD next week,
"Boy Meets World" illustrates the
importance of relationships in
ourlives. If nothingelse, itinstills
a fervent desire to spend the rest
of your life with your best friends
at your side, helping you make
sense of a random and chaotic
universe. The fact remains that
"Boy Meets World" is more intel-
ligent, funny and relevant than
most shows marketed toward
today's teens.
As Shawn puts it, "TV is the
true mirror of our lives." Amen,
buddy.

The Exhibit Museum of Natural History was founded under 19th-century ideals.

MUSEUMS
From Page 1B
preoccupied with authenticity and guar-
anteeing that one object could be repre-
sentative of the whole - among others.
The University's Exhibit Museum of
Natural History stands as testament to
these 19th century ideals - the skeleton of
an ancient sea creature hangingtenuously
off the ceiling, chasing its prey; a mag-
nificent diorama of a reptile-like animal
prowling the lands; a display case crowd-
ed with specimens taken directly off the
pages of Audubon's "Birds of America."
Director of Education Kira Berman refers
to the museum's organization as a "great
chain of being," with the primordial tri-
lobites at the bottom of the chain and the
Planetarium and space-age discoveries
peering benevolently from the top.
At the entrance of the museum's Hall of
Evolution sits a massive hunk of petrified
wood, one of Berman's favorite objects in
the building.
"We use it td talk about the process of
fossilization," she said. "How water car-
ries the minerals into the tissue of the tree
while the tissue is still there, fills into the
interstitial spaces and then eventually the
wood itself rots away - leaving only the
minerals."
Of course, not all object collections
consist of decayed skeletons and hol-
lowed-out rocks. At the Matthaei Botani-
cal Gardens and the Nichols Arboretum,
the living and blooming flowers, fruits
and vegetables take center stage. The
phrase "botanical garden" hasa monastic,
medicinal bent to it - Mendel's pea plants
spring to mind - and indeed, the first
area of its kind sprung from the medieval
"physic gardens" that doctors maintained
to treat their patients. While nowadays
the term has atrophied into something
with more of a public face, the plants
inside certainly haven't.
"It's like a living museum," said Prof.
Bob Grese, director of the Botanical Gar-
dens and the Arboretum.
For Grese, the purpose of the museum
always has been to educate the public on
the greater concerns of plant conserva-
tion and maintenance, whether through
an interactive display of edible cocoa
plants or a stunning recreation-of a desert
biome.
"I think people have always been
dependent on plants for food, for medi-
cine, for all kinds of things," Grese
explained. "Today, people don'trecognize
their connection quite as readily. They're

not as involved in collecting plants that
they might use for medicine, or they buy
food in grocery stores and don't necessar-
ily connect with growing it. So in some
ways that becomes a real opportunity or
challenge for us in the botanical gardens
to tryto re-forge that connection." The Matthei Botanical Gardens are turning their

efforts toward increasing sustainability.
"I can continue to love the fact that
early settlers in this country thought
that mastodon skulls were the skulls of
Cyclops," she said. "I continue to teach
that during (docent training sessions),
saying, 'Here's a story that can show you
the different ways of looking at that one
object.'
"I think that we're beginning to be able
to tell those kinds of stories again - to be
more inclusive, rather than saying, 'Well,
that's not objective, so we can't display
that.'
A new direction
Recently, museums have been under-
going a radical change.
"Whereas originally museums were
about things, there's been a shift in think-
ing that museums are really about people.
They're social institutions," Silverman
said.
Fundamentally, a person will visit a
museum with his or her own individual
way of thinking, and as a result that per-
son experiences what's offered up at the
museum differently from anyone else
there - in spite of the relative stasis of the
objects themselves.
Originally, however, the absolute model
for a museum was for an authority on the
topic, the curator, to offer up his own nar-
rative on the exhibit to a passive audience.
To Silverman, it resembled a monologue:
"Here it is, take it or leave it."
Now, museums have gained reputation
as more dialogical spaces, with the audi-
ence, the curator and museum conversing
with each other - a relationship con-
stantly in flux.
"They're becoming places where
exhibits can be multi-vocal," Berman
said. "There's not just one voice of author-
ity and there can be more forums for dis-
cussion."
Of course, this assembly of voices is not
without its critics. Especially within the
practice of digitalization - museums put-
ting up the entirety of their collections on
the Internet in an effort to become more
accessible to the public - people question
whether the physical institution will lose
some of its hold on the public audience.
"There's been a lot of dust that's been
kicked up in the air as a result of (digi-
talization)," Silverman said. "There are
some people that are running around like 
Chicken Little saying, 'The sky is falling,
the sky is falling, museums are extinct,
nobody's going to want to come anymore
because it's all available on the Web.'
"But I'm a really firm believer in the
object, the original object - what we refer
to as the 'aura' of the original. And the fact.
that that is somethingthat will ensure the
museums' future."
For Grese, maintaining the Arboretum
and Botanical Gardens has helped him
to understand people's relationship with
nature.
"For a lot of people, having a place to go
out and understand plants, to reflect on
their relationship with the natural world
is important," he said. "It's not just con-
serving nature by itself but showing how
people relate to it."
Grese's efforts for the museum's future
are rooted in sustainability. The Michi-

gan Solar House (otherwise known as the
MiSo* house), an entry in the 2005 Solar
Decathlon and designed by the Univer-
sity's Taubman College of Architecture
and Urban Planning, sits on one side of
the Botanical Gardens. Within the house,
all the appliances are powered by the sun-
light outside and the plants that frame the
front yard.
. Over time, he is also trying to reduce
the areas where the lawn is mowed.
"The goal is to get to a point ... where we
won't do as much planting, a buffer that
provides better habitat value," he said. "A
mowed lawn is notcvery diverse. The taller
grasses and blooming plants have more of
a habitat value and food value for butter-
flies and bird species."
To create a place where new objects
spring forward from old ones is an inter-
esting consideration - a permutation of
the concept of "aura."
All the directors admit that running
their respective museums has influenced
their experiences of visitingone.
"We joke around inthe museumstudies
program, that once you've been through
this course, museums will not be the same
for you," Silverman said. "Before, you go
into a museum of art and you go to see the
art. Now ... your experience of looking at
the art is going to be competing with you
thinking about, 'OK, well, how are they
fixing the light?' and, 'What kinds of col-
ors are they using on the wall?' and also
to look at how other people are engaging
with the exhibits."
Berman described herself as "jaded."
"I look with more of a professional eye
than spme people," she said. "I look at
things that people don't see.
. "But, when Igo with my six-and-a-half
year old to a museum, I'm just like any-
one else. I think that museums are places
where we form memories and we find
inspiration. That's what the word means,
right? 'Muse."'

HIJAB
From Page 3B
"For the first seven years (I wore a
headscarf), it was about matching my
hijab to my outfit," LSA senior and Mus-
lim Student Association president Eman
Abdelhadi said. "For the next seven
years, it was about matching my outfit to
my hijab!"
Abdelhadi has been wearing hijab
since she was nine years old and is a fan
of the colorful silky scarves she finds
during her visits to Egypt.
"They're just so gorgeous," she said. "I
tend to wear more solid colors, so I love
just wearing a pretty normal outfit that's
just solid colors ... and then having the
hijab be the thing that pops out. Every-
one's looking at it, so might as well make
it pretty!"

Abdelhadi is used to getting atten-
tion everywhere when she wears hijab in
public, although it doesn't bother her as
much in Ann Arbor.
"There is a sense of being different and
being stared at," she said. "The reason I
know this is because I travel to the Mid-
dle East relatively frequently, and when I
travel, it's a different feeling. At first, it's
hard to pinpoint, but then I realize it's
because people aren't staring at me when
I walk in a room. I'm used to (walking)
into a room and everyone (looking) at me.
... There's sort of the lingering gaze."
Both Ali and Alhawary also pointed
out the misconceptions surrounding the
practice of hijab and the thought that it
intrinsically oppresses women. Ali said
she has had trouble finding work at hone
in Norway because some people refuse
to employ wearers of hijab. Alhawary
argues that it is important to separate

the religious foundation of hijab from
its cultural contexts - the other stricter
practices that sometimes occur in con-
junction with it. He said the intent of the
religious ruling can be equally misun-
derstood by Muslims and non-Muslims
because it is observed in countries where
policies are employed that affect the lives
of women for political reasons rather
than religious ones.
Despite its potential to be miscon-
strued, Ali and Abdelhadi are proud to
wear hijab on their own terms and repre-
