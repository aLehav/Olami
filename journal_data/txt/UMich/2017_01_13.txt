M-Write 
— 
a 
program 

promoting 
conceptual 

learning 
through 
writing 

housed inside the Digital 
Innovation Greenhouse in the 
Office of Digital Education 
— continues to grow as it 
introduces 
writing 
and 
a 

peer 
review 
program 
to 

introductory-level 
STEM-

oriented and social science 
courses, though this is the 
third semester of its use.

M-Write will be utilized 

in 
three 
courses 
during 

the winter 2017 semester: 
Economics 
101, 
Material 

Science 
Engineering 
250 

and Biology 174. Economics 
is the largest class that will 
use M-Write, with over 300 
students.

A computer program called 

M-Write 
II 
anonymously 

distributes prompted writings 
to three other members of the 
course for peer review. The 
program then returns the 
student commentary to the 
original student, who revises 
their work accordingly.

Anne Gere, professor of 

education and English and 
Director of the Sweetland 
Center for Writing, initiated 
the project and said the goal 
is to promote deeper learning 
through the inclusion of a 
writing component.

Around 300 gathered in the 

Lydia 
Mendelssohn 
Theater 

Thursday night to see the 2016 
National Book Award-winning 
novelist Colson Whitehead read 
passages shining light on the 
horrors of slavery from his book 
“The Underground Railroad.”

Throughout 
his 
speech, 

Whitehead explained the novel’s 
conception; he first thought of 
writing about slavery in the year 
2000, but he didn’t begin writing 
it until three years ago, when he 
felt he had matured. 

“I knew if I had started then, 

I would have fucked it up,” 
Whitehead said. “So I was like, ‘I 
will wait and write more books 
and perhaps become a better 
writer … and hopefully I will be 
more mature and able to tackle 
it.’ ”

Whitehead said he is fortunate 

to be able to use his novel and 
platform to illustrate the torture 
and abuse his ancestors and 
others suffered under slavery in 
America.

“When I was working on the 

book, I had to start grappling 
with the horrors of slavery,” 
Whitehead said. “I don’t know 
where my family came from 
… I don’t know who they were 
or where they died, but part of 
writing this book right, writing it 
good, was honoring them.” 

Whitehead 
also 
offered 

commentary 
on 
America’s 

current racial climate, stating 

the election of Donald Trump 
as president is proof white 
supremacy is still prominent in 
the country.

Whitehead said he believes 

certain passages of the book, 
such as when free Blacks are 
stopped and frisked, have greater 
meaning now.

“When the election happened, 

I did start reading different 
sections 
from 
the 
book,” 

Whitehead said. “The book sort of 
does read differently now that we 
have this sort of re-entrenchment 
of white supremacy.”

LSA sophomore Colin Page 

said he attended the event 

both because he has read “The 
Underground 
Railroad” 
and 

because one of his professors 
recommended students attend.

Page said his interest piqued 

when Whitehead talked about 
his approach to writing about the 
theme of oppression, specifically 
the parallels he drew between 
race relations during slavery and 
today.

“I specifically enjoyed when 

he talked about how he mingled 
historical aspects of the book 
with realism in order to comment 
on society and the oppression he 
sees that was prevalent 200 years 
ago, and is still unfortunately very 

prevalent today,” Page said. “He 
used the mixture of the two to 
show the duality between the two 
ages and how we’re still wrestling 
with a lot of the same issues that 
we were.”

LSA freshman Scott Bays 

echoed 
Page’s 
sentiment, 

saying his major takeaway from 
Whitehead’s lecture was his use 
of the past in his novel to draw 
parallels to and comment on 
oppression in today’s society.

“I 
thought 
it 
was 
really 

interesting how he could use 
fiction and genre to expand the 
scope of what he was saying,” 
Bays said.

The beginning of a new 

semester is traditionally a time 
of recruitment and increased 
student involvement in different 
organizations on campus. At 
Winterfest, the University of 
Michigan 
chapters 
of 
both 

College Republicans and College 
Democrats had tables to promote 
mobilization and their respective 
agendas for 2017.

With President-elect Trump’s 

inauguration 
only 
a 
week 

away, the two political groups 
are focused on how the new 
administration will affect their 
future efforts to promote various 
ideologies, as well as increasing 
student political efficacy, which 
would lead to wider involvement 
and student knowledge about 
current political events.

While the University College 

Republicans 
are 
“thrilled” 

about 
President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s victory, according to 
LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 
president of the organization, 
they plan to focus largely on local 
Michigan state politics during 
the winter semester. They have

Congressional Republican initiative spurs discontent from campus community

On 
Jan. 
5, 
Speaker 
of 

the 
House 
Paul 
Ryan 
(R) 

announced a budget bill that 
would begin to repeal President 
Barack Obama’s health care law 
and would include language 

that 
would 
strip 
Planned 

Parenthood of more than half 
of a billion dollars in annual 
federal funding.

“Planned 
Parenthood 

legislation would be in our 
reconciliation bill,” Ryan said at 
a press conference.

Republican 
lawmakers 

have tried for years to strip 

the 
reproductive 
health 

organization 
of 
its 
federal 

funding, particularly since it 
faced an investigation by the 
House Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform in 
2015 dealing with the purported 
illegal sale of fetal tissue.

Although the investigation 

found no evidence of illegal 

acts, 
it 
placed 
Planned 

Parenthood and its Democratic 
allies on the defense. Ruth 
Lednicer, Planned Parenthood 
of Michigan director of media 
and communications, said in 
an interview the protestors are 
active even at the traditionally 
liberal Ann Arbor locations.

It’s 
possible 
Michiganders 

could soon see the reduction or 
even elimination of the state’s 4.25 
percent income tax, as discussions 
on different proposals in both 
the state House and Senate are 
underway.

House Bill 4001, which would 

reduce the 4.25 percent tax to 3.9 
percent in 2018 and then reduce 
the tax by another 0.1 percent 
each year over a span of 40 years 
until the income tax is eliminated, 
was introduced by state Rep. 
Lee Chatfield (R–Levering) on 
Thursday.

Additionally, state Sen. Jack 

Brandenburg

In a move taken straight 

out 
of 
the 
“Parks 
and 

Recreation” 
playbook, 
the 

Michigan Secretary of State 
rolled out a cool and hip rap 
video 
featuring 
Secretary 

of State Ruth Johnson and 
Roo — a kangaroo — in order 
to advertise the Secretary of 
State’s website, expressSOS.
com.

The website is intended 

to save Michigan residents a 
trip to the Secretary of State’s 
office, 
offering 
services 

like 
renewing 
vehicle 

registrations, 
replacing 
a 

driver’s license and updating 
personal information.

Johnson’s rap emphasizes 

that “nobody has time to lose 
and that time to lose is such 
old news”. Instead of getting 
in line, Johnson says, we 
should follow the example of 

Roo, and hop online. And, in 
what seems to be an homage 
to the Sugar Hill Gang’s song 
“Rapper’s Delight,” Johnson 
instructs 
the 

audience 
to 

“bang bang your 
keyboard to the 
‘boogiest’ 
of 

beats.”

The video is a 

combination 
of 

clips of Johnson 
speaking, 
whether 
to 

the 
camera 
or 

in 
public, 
and 

several other non 
sequitur 
stock 

videos, including 
a 
man 
playing 

golf, an airplane 
taking 
off 
and 

people riding a 
roller coaster.

Though 
in 
the 
video 

Johnson claims to be “rapping 
to the beat,” the song can’t be 
described as anything other 

than rather unpleasant, or 
just bizarre.

KEVIN ZHENG/Daily

Circus Bar & Billiards on South 1st Street is closing on Saturday night.

Ann Arbor mainstay Circus Bar and 
Billiards to close over the weekend

Patrons reflect on nights of karaoke, pool and 25 cent beers ahead of final night

Thirsty patrons lined up 

for 25 cent beers as billiard 
balls clanked off one another, 
a 
solitary 
singer 
tackled 

Styx’s “Renegade” and people 
took selfies in the fun-house 
mirror, it was the beginning 
of a normal Wednesday night 
of debauchery, revelry and 
camraderie at Circus Bar & 
Billiards on South First Street. 

For Engineering graduate 

student 
Andrew 
Hartman, 

Circus was the ideal spot for 
him and his friends to spend 
an unusually quiet Wednesday 
night.

“It’s a very different vibe 

in having karaoke and the 
pool being the main focus,” 
Hartman said. “It is a fun place 
to be, you get to hang out with 
your friends, eat free popcorn 

and play pool.”

Yet, 
as 
DJ 
Pete 
took 

control of the microphone, 
he 
reminded 
the 
crowd 

that 
Circus, 
which 
has 

entertained college students, 
karaoke enthusiasts and pool 
sharks from Ann Arbor and 
Washtenaw County for over 20 
years, will be closing its doors 
for good on Saturday.

Circus, which occupies the 

third floor of a multi-story 
nightclub complex, shares a 
space with the Millennium 
Club on the second floor, and 
the Cavern Club on the first 
floor. The Cavern Club, which 
elementary-school 
teacher 

turned bar owner Nick Easton 
opened in 1997, was the first of 
the three clubs to occupy the 
building, with Circus the last 
to open. However, despite its 
recent popularity, Circus has 
recently been sold to buyers 
from New York.

Yet, as the Cavern Club 

became a venue for large 
groups to rent out and the 
Millennium Club a spot for 
those who wished to immerse 
themselves in a world of LED 
lights and disco balls, Circus 
possessed a more laid-back 
atmosphere 
that 
attracted 

swaths of groups.

To longtime bartender and 

former manager Race Rogers, 
Circus’ 
unique 
atmosphere 

allowed 
guests 
a 
diverse 

experience.

“Hundreds of people could 

come here in a night and 
socialize 
with 
each 
other 

without being segregated by 
tables or by segregated by too 
loud of music at the dance 
floor,” Rogers said. “This place 
really is just a place to come 
and hang out and it is one of 
the only places people can do 
that in Ann Arbor in that kind 
of social environment.”

With 
Circus’ 
karaoke 

attracting 
hundreds 
of 

people to the stage to sing 
along 
to 
their 
favorite 

tunes, Rogers feels there is a 
renewed need for a karaoke 
bar in Ann Arbor’s nightlife 
landscape.

“For at least five years, 

we have done karaoke at 
least four times a week 
and it is packed almost 
every night, with three to 
six hundred people every 
Friday and Saturday night,” 
Rogers said. “With that 
said, that means there will 
be a lot of people looking for 
a place to sing karaoke … as 
karaoke is a bonding thing 
to do on any given weekend 
night, as you go out with a 
group of friends and sing 
some ridiculous songs.”

For Rogers, on a more 

personal level, not only is 
Ann Arbor losing a karaoke 
club and bar, but he is losing 
a place that he has come 
to spend a large amount of

“The big piece is that writing 

fosters learning and we need 
to take advantage of that in 
the courses where students 
are least likely to think about 
writing,” Gere said.

The winter 2017 semester 

is the third semester during 
which the M-Write program 
has been used. It was used in 
MSE 250 as a pilot course in the 
spring of 2016 and five courses 
in the fall of 2016. However, 
Gere said she began work on 
incorporating 
writing-to-

learn pedagogy in more STEM 
courses in 2009.

According 
to 
Gere, 
her 

work 
was 
largely 
based 

on her observation of the 
paucity of upper-level writing 
courses within STEM majors 
and on the inspiration of 
Structured Study Groups that 
bring together upper- and 
lower-level 
undergraduates 

to 
facilitate 
learning 
and 

teaching.

Gere said, after receiving 

grants, 
the 
program 
was 

able to expand to include the 
computer program and will 
continue growing over the next 
five years. She added that she 
hopes the program becomes an 
integral part of courses across 
campus.

“The vision would be that 

ultimately this becomes part 
of a bigger initiative, so that 
it’s just sort of assumed that 
in these big courses there is 
going to be writing,” she said. 
“And because of that writing, 
students are going to do better, 
they’re going to learn better 
and they’re going to feel more 
positive about the course that 
they’re in.”

According to a University 

of Michigan press release, 
M-Write 
II 
received 
$1.89 

million over five years from 
Transforming Learning for the 
Third Century Initiative.

M-Write developer David 

Harlan, who is collaborating 
with Sweetland on the project, 
said this program is unlike 
other peer review systems 
used on other campuses, which 
tend not to be user-friendly.

“Sometimes, even if they 

present a pretty face, they 
don’t necessarily track the 
student through the process 
in the specific ways that we’re 
looking to do,” he said. “And so 
one of the things we set out to 
do from the very beginning is 
to involve people who would 

be using the tool in its design.”

Additionally, Chris Teplovs, 

a leading Digital Innovation 
Greenhouse 
developer, 
said 

M-Write is also expanding 
with the research of post-
doctoral students, who analyze 
the 
papers 
students 
have 

written for M-Write classes to 
potentially codify quality work 
in each subject and facilitate 
efficient 
grading. 
However, 

he said the emphasis is not on 
the technology, but rather the 
learning they hope to promote 
with the technology.

“The technology is integral 

and yet should fade away as 
much as possible,” Teplovs 
said. “So we don’t say it’s all 
about M-Write, we say it’s all 
about writing-to-learn. So it’s 
about the pedagogy.”

Another component of the 

M-Write program is the use of 
more advanced undergraduate 
students as writing fellows to 
aid students in the peer review 
and revision process and to 
grade the essays.

Business 
sophomore 

Cassandra Wong, a writing 
fellow for Economics 101 for 
the past two semesters, said 
she felt writing brought a 
different type of learning to the 

course that cannot be achieved 
with the typical homework for 
economics courses.

“I feel like with these large 

introductory STEM classes, 
writing kind of gets lost in 
the process of just learning 
the material because it’s a lot 
of memorization and models 
and graphs and whatever,” she 
said. “I feel like having actual 
writing assignments, you get 
to see students with their 
thinking process when they’re 
answering these prompts.”

Business 
sophomore 

Brandon 
Staarman, 
also 
a 

writing fellow for Economics 
101, said M-Write provided 
deeper 
learning 
not 
only 

from writing itself, but also 
from the student commentary 
component.

“The peer review process 

is really important because 
not only are they receiving 

feedback about what they’ve 
written, they also get to look 
at three other essays that 
students have written,” he 
said. “So they can learn from 
each other.”

Staarman also noted how 

this type of writing is different 
from the writing students are 
exposed to in the first-year 
writing requirement.

“Writing 
is 
such 
an 

important 
skill 
that 
it’s 

important to see how you 
can apply it in other different 
areas, and also important to 
realize you can learn a lot 
through because it teaches 
you how to narrow down your 
arguments and how to be clear 
and concise and really get your 
point across,” he said. 

However, 
Business 

sophomore 
Mira 
Sanghvi, 

another writing fellow for 
Economics 101, noticed how 
several students in the fall 
reacted 
negatively 
to 
the 

program, 
namely 
because 

only two sections participated 
and all other sections did 
the 
typical 
homework 
for 

economics.

“They felt like they were 

kind of at a disadvantage; they 
were not as pleased with it,” 
she said. “But what we noticed 
is that their grades in the class 
were no different than the 
other sections.” 

Gere said she has also 

encountered faculty members 
who 
view 
the 
program 

positively but have doubts 
about 
incorporating 
it 

throughout all STEM classes.

“It’s a mixed picture,” she 

said. “I’ve not talked to any 
faculty who have said this is 
a really bad idea, but many of 
them say ‘it’s too much work,’ 
‘I can’t figure out how I could 
fit it in,’ that kind of thing. 
But everybody says ‘we need 
students to do more writing, 
what you’re doing makes a lot 
of sense, I’d really like to do it.’ 
And then the ‘buts’ come in.”

However, Teplovs said the 

program is an effective way 
of improving both methods of 
teaching and learning.

“It’s 
understanding 
that 

teaching 
and 
learning 
are 

intrinsically linked,” he said. 
“And the role that M-Write 
plays is in facilitating the 
improvement 
of 
both 
by 

reflecting on the opposite. 
So we see improvements of 
prompts and the extension of 
that is thinking deeply about 
how 
you’re 
teaching 
what 

you’re teaching to get to the 
prompt, to get to the answer, to 
get to the understanding.”

“They 
try 
to 
convince 

women not to go in,” Lednicer 
said. “They don’t even know 
what they’re going in for, 
whether it’s something very 
personal, or just a check-up.”

Now, with Republicans in 

control of Congress, Republican 
lawmakers have a renewed 
interested 
in 
defunding 

Planned Parenthood, arguing 
that funding should be routed 
to health care providers that 
provide similar services, but 
not abortions.

LSA senior Rachel Crawford, 

president of Students for Life, 
has a similar plan that she 
would like to see implemented.

“Students for Life would 

like to see Planned Parenthood 
defunded, but we want that 
funding to go elsewhere to 
help women and impoverished 
communities,” Crawford said. 
“(Federally Qualified Health 
Centers) are public clinics for 
women’s care and children’s 
care 
in 
impoverished 

neighborhoods. They actually 
provide more services than 
Planned Parenthood.”

LSA 
freshman 
Matthew 

Brosky, who identifies with 
conservative 
views, 
agreed 

with Crawford’s goals. Though 
he said he doesn’t support 
federally 
funding 
these 

programs, he still believes 
quality health care should be 
accessible.

“Even though I’m not for 

funding Planned Parenthood 
or supporting the Affordable 
Care Act, I don’t think we 
should turn away from those 
who really need support in 
paying for health care,” Brosky 
said. “There are alternatives. 
I’m pretty sure you can get 
contraceptives and treatment 
at UHS.”

Lednicer pushed back at 

claims 
that 
routing 
funds 

toward health care providers 
that 
don’t 
offer 
abortions 

would help those in poverty.

“There’s been an argument 

that if people can’t come here, 
they will just go somewhere 
else,” 
Lednicer 
said. 
“But 

anyone who uses Medicaid 
would not be able to come to 
Planned 
Parenthood. 
That 

would mean that they would 
have to find another willing 
provider who takes Medicaid, 
and many do not.”

Additionally, 
Lednicer 

said 
alternative 
women’s 

health care providers aren’t 

as common or inexpensive as 
Planned Parenthood opponents 
think. Planned Parenthood is 
free of copays, a cost she said 
could burden many patients.

Although 
many 
people 

think 
Planned 
Parenthood 

receives their federal funds 
like an allowance, the federal 
funding they receive is instead 
reimbursed through Medicaid, 
and often at less than the cost 
of services.

“We 
take 
reimbursement 

levels usually lower than the 
costs of the service because we 
fundraise so much,” Lednicer 
said. “The people most affected 
are those in low income and 
rural areas. A quarter of the 
counties in Michigan do not 
have an OB/GYN. For those 
people, often we are the only 
way to access health care.”

Currently, about 40 percent 

of 
Planned 
Parenthood’s 

revenue is federally funded. 
The 
$500 
million 
dollar 

fund has been criticized for 
being too high; Brosky said it 
shouldn’t be the responsibility 
of taxpayers.

“I 
don’t 
think 
it’s 
the 

taxpayers’ 
job 
to 
support 

Planned 
Parenthood,” 

said Brosky. “I am just not 
comfortable 
supporting 

abortions.”

This concern is shared by 

many, as most conservative 
taxpayers 
want 
to 
avoid 

funding abortions. However, 
the Hyde Amendment, which 
was 
passed 
in 
1976, 
bars 

federal 
funds 
from 
paying 

for abortions, unless in the 
case of rape or to save the 
mother’s life. Joanne Bailey, 
a women’s studies professor 
and the director of the Nurse 
Midwifery Service at Michigan 
Medicine (formerly University 
of Michigan Health Service), 
said emotional responses that 
don’t consider the legislation 
we have in place are fueling the 
issue’s polarization.

“I try to de-emotionalize the 

issues in class,” Bailey said. 
“Let’s take it back to the facts. 
Let’s look at actual research. 
It’s not just about emotional 
responses, but is rooted in 
information.”

Although 
emotional 

responses 
could 
confuse 

the issue at hand, Lednicer 
said there could be tangible 
consequences 
to 
repealing 

Planned Parenthood.

“When 
they 
talk 
about 

defunding us, they are talking 
about 
defunding 
patients,” 

Lednicer said. “Across the 
state, we saw about 60,000 
patients last year and in Ann 
Arbor, we saw over 8,500. One 
in 5 women in this county come 
to Planned Parenthood.”

Republican lawmakers are 

attempting to defund Planned 
Parenthood by defunding Title 
X, a federal program devoted 
solely 
to 
family 
planning 

services. 
Although 
those 

lawmakers are interested in 
limiting 
abortions, 
Bailey 

said getting rid of Planned 
Parenthood could actually end 
up directing women toward 
needing the procedures more 
often.

“Ironically, 
what 

(lawmakers) 
are 
trying 
to 

do with this is going to lead 
women 
towards 
needing 

more abortions,” Bailey said. 
“They’re trying to defund an 
institution that provides birth 
control, and with birth control 
hard to obtain, there will be 
more pregnancies.”

Regardless 
of 
the 

consequences 
of 
defunding 

Planned Parenthood, Bailey 
said the premise of defunding 
Planned 
Parenthood 
has 

been altered by the use of 
inflammatory “buzzwords.”

“I believe that our lawmakers 

are really interested in the big 
buzzwords,” Bailey said. “They 
make 
Planned 
Parenthood 

associated with abortions only, 
and the Affordable Care Act is 
nicknamed ‘Obamacare’ and 
associated 
with 
Democrats 

only. When you look at what 
Planned Parenthood actually 
does, most people will get 
behind it. It’s really the label 
that’s leading the charge as 
opposed to reality.”

Regardless of whether or 

not Republican lawmakers are 
successful in the repeal of the 
President Obama’s health care 
law, Crawford said the debate 
alone would inspire change.

“I think that with (Planned 

Parenthood) being in the news, 
whether or not it’s defunded, 
brings up a really important 
discussion about where the 
funding should go,” Crawford 
said. “Even people who are in 
favor of the Affordable Care 
Act want some new changes to 
be made and those are being 
brought into the spotlight.”

specifically decided to support 
University Regent Ron Weiser 
in his campaign for Michigan 
Republican Chair.

“We decided to support him, 

and we’re going to be helping 
him out throughout conventions 
— there’s one convention in 
February that he told us we could 
send as many volunteers over 
there as we can, and we definitely 
plan on doing so,” Zalamea said.

According 
to 
Weiser’s 

website, his campaign for Regent 
included promises to “straighten 
U of M’s books and reduce the 
burden on the taxpayers of 
Michigan.” Weiser also states 
on his website his history and 
political credentials are focused 
centrally on “defeating Barack 
Obama’s liberal agenda” and 
fighting hard against the power 
of Unions. Similarly, Weiser ran 
with the promise of cutting costs 
so students at campuses such 
as UM-Flint or UM-Dearborn 
may receive the same quality 
education 
as 
that 
which 
is 

provided by the University’s main 
Ann Arbor campus.

College 
Republicans 
also 

expressed their plan to tackle 
the issue of identity politics — 
the phenomenon of people in 
particular groups of society, such 
as race, religion or socioeconomic 
status, forming political alliances 
that deviate from traditional 
broad-based parties — within the 
campus community this semester.

The 
Michigan 
College 

Republicans believe this tendency 
has a profound impact on free 
speech on college campuses, and 
has decided to take a firm stance 
on expanding free speech rights 
at the University. On campus, the 
question of what constitutes hate 
speech, and whether or not the 

vocalization of certain ideas may 
lead to an unsafe environment, 
has been called into question. 
Immediately following Trump’s 
victory, certain violent images 
painted on the Rock, a University 
landmark at the intersection 
of Hill Street and Washtenaw 
Avenue, caused the community to 
examine potential divisive issues 

of certain speech.

“We definitely want to address 

identity politics, and how it 
plays a role in the University,” 
said Zalamea. “That’s one of 
our biggest focuses, and how it 
ties into free speech on college 
campuses.”

The College Democrats at 

the University too are changing 
their trajectory for the winter 
semester and replacing electoral 
work, which focused largely on 
the potential success of Hillary 
Clinton in the general election, 
with work toward progressive 
issue 
advocacy. 
Four 
issue 

committees are housed within 
the greater College Democrats 
organization: 
women’s 
rights, 

the LGBTQ community, social 
justice and the environment. 
Each of these committees has 
wide discretion regarding policy 
and the ability to confront 
very specific issues that are 
increasingly relevant.

Despite 
the 
loss 
during 

election 
season, 
Michigan 

College Democrats stated their 
objective is not abandoned, but 
rather that their agenda has been 
altered to promote and recognize 
progressive ideals. According to 
LSA junior Colin Kelly, president 
of College Democrats, they plan 
to mobilize students through 
transparency, Democratic values 
and awareness within the campus 
community.

“Though we don’t have a 

central goal like we did last 
semester, 
we 
now 
have 
an 

opportunity — and obligation 
— to continue fighting for and 
advocating 
our 
progressive 

values that we know are the right 
choices for our campus, state and 
nation,” Kelly said.

Nursing 
freshman 
Kristen 

Reynolds, a member of College 
Democrats at the University, 
agrees that mobilization is vital to 
progress, especially following the 
impassioned atmosphere at the 
University in the wake of Trump’s 
victory in November.

“I read so many Facebook posts 

from friends that aren’t usually 
politically active, but were angry 
with the outcomes,” Reynolds 
said. 
“I 
hope 
that 
College 

Democrats can get more people 
involved on campus politically 
and harness that passion.”

In the wake of the 2016 election, 

many students have shared a 
desire to promote togetherness 
by increasing cordiality between 
Michigan College Democrats and 
Republicans. LSA freshman Haya 
Akbik criticized both the College 
Democrats’ 
and 
the 
College 

Republicans’ 
uncompromising 

natures.

“I think both campus groups 

need to show that compromise 
and respectful dialogue must 
occur in order to create good 
political change,” said Akbik. 
“Being so stuck on being a 
Democrat or a Republican is 

harmful to our country and our 
relations with one another.”

Reynolds agreed with the 

sentiment of togetherness and 
stated that the prevention of a 
hateful atmosphere following the 
Trump victory supersedes loyalty 
to traditionally stagnant party 
differences.

“After 
the 
election, 
many 

College Republican clubs came 
out and said they don’t stand 
for this racism, bigotry, hate 
and sexism,” said Reynolds. “I 
would love for our groups to put 
our political beliefs aside to fight 
the hate and hate crimes that 
have occurred as a result of the 
election.”

the elimination of the 4.25 percent 
income tax could have, saying the 
chief argument for scrapping the 
tax would be that people would 
have more disposable income and 
thus spend more money.

“The one benefit that you can 

see here is that by scrapping 
the tax, you put more money in 
people’s pockets, and they might 
spend more,” Cho said.

Conversely, Cho said the main 

issue with eliminating the tax is 
the loss in revenues.

“If you scrap the 4.25 percent, 

the question then becomes, ‘what 
do you do instead,’ ” Cho said.

Offering 
two 
predictions, 

Cho said the government would 
then be forced to decide between 
either doing nothing and cutting 
infrastructure spending or raising 
revenues another way, such as 
increasing the sales tax. According 
to Cho, the government would 
have to be careful with raising the 
sales tax, because taxes on basic 
goods disproportionately affect 
lower-income individuals.

“If you don’t do anything, you 

have to give up infrastructure 
spending,” Cho said. “If you 
decide to raise the sales tax, that 
would get back revenue, but the 
downside is a sales tax is relatively 
regressive … the tax burden now 
starts to fall disproportionately on 
the low income.”

The 
nonpartisan 
Michigan 

Senate Fiscal Agency reported 
that $9.6 billion — 19 percent — 
of all state revenue was collected 
from the personal income tax in 
2014 and 2015.

Gov. Rick Snyder is willing 

to discuss tax reform with the 
legislature, but he expressed 
concern over the loss of state 
revenues 
from 
Brandenburg’s 

proposal, the Detroit Free Press 

reported.

“The governor is always open 

to new ideas and welcomes the 
discussion on tax reform,” Anna 
Heaton, spokeswoman for Gov. 
Snyder, told the Free Press. “For 
this particular proposal, there 
would need to be concrete data to 
demonstrate that there is adequate 
revenue from sources besides the 
income tax to ensure that services 
for residents and investing in our 
statewide infrastructure would 
not be adversely affected.”

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Republicans, 
said 
from 
a 
conservative 

perspective, he is supportive of 
the tax cut because he believes 
it would benefit business and 
families.

“If you look at all those states 

that have eliminated their income 
taxes, such as Florida, Texas and 
Tennessee, those are all states 
that are characterized by a lot 
of growth, especially in small 
businesses,” Zalamea said.

Zalamea 
also 
said 
he 
is 

supportive of the plan in part 
because people in economically 
weaker cities such as Detroit and 
Flint could benefit from a tax cut.

“When you look at Detroit and 

you see where it’s come from, you 
see the income tax as a way to 
spur growth there,” Zalamea said. 
“When people have more money 
to spend, then they’re going to be 
spending more of it.”

Zalamea said he believes it’s 

evident that Lansing wants the 
tax cut, but they still have to 
explore how to replace the loss in 
revenues.

“The main thing for me 

personally 
is 
I 
think 
there 

shouldn’t be an income tax,” 
Zalamea said. “I approve of 
this plan that they have, but 
realistically speaking, I don’t 
think it’s going to happen for 
another few years.”

For part-time doorman Todd 

Howland, who has worked 
at Circus off and on for eight 
years, Circus was not simply

glimpse into the lives of today’s

time to put myself in the

young 
people,” 

Howland said. “It is nice to see 
young people who really want 
to work hard and seeing young 
people enjoying themselves.”

A

s our bodies change, so 
do our perceptions of the 
body types we consider 

“normal.” As a young white girl 
growing up in a small town, 
surrounded by other young 
white girls, it was easy to pick 
out my own flaws in comparison 
to theirs. In the classic coming-
of-age fashion, I came to realize 
that the world of bodies was 
incredibly diverse outside of my 
community, yet in spite of this, 
the representation of bodies in 
media is still focused narrowly 
on the same young, white, 
feminine bodies with which I 
was so familiar. 

For centuries, there have 

been women who have been 
unhappy with the way they look. 
Though trends have changed, 
this commonality of a negative 
body image has remained. This 
critical self-perception is most 
prominent through adolescence 
and 
typically 
persists 
into 

adulthood. Various literature 
suggests that perfectionism, 
defined by Merriam-Webster 
as “a disposition to regard 
anything short of perfection as 
unacceptable,” is a core factor 
in body dissatisfaction and 
eating disorders among women.

What I quickly learned was 

that the University of Michigan 
is home to an exceedingly large 
population of perfectionists, 
which 
explained 
both 
the 

intense 
academic 
standards 

to 
which 
students 
held 

themselves and the consistent 
physical regime which those 
very same students follow. 
I personally do not have the 
necessary determination and 
work ethic that is required for 
a perfectionist personality, but 
many of my friends and peers do. 
While in various circumstances 
such a personality is useful and 
rewarding (by holding oneself 
to high standards, one is more 
apt to travel upward in terms of 
career and success), in terms of 
body image and the perfectibility 

of the body — specifically among 
women — perfectionism quickly 
becomes dangerous.

The prevalence of thinness in 

the media can explain the ideals 
to which women so strictly 
hold themselves. What various 
studies (and common sense) 
show us is most media outlets 
portray women as thin, and 
representation 
matters. 
This 

topic has many branches, but 
focusing specifically on body 
type, ask yourself how many 
female television characters you 
can think of with body types that 
would wear anywhere between 
a size 16-18 (the sizes of the 
average American woman as 
reported by Psychology Today).

A dangerous mix is created 

when women are told that 
the admirable body type is 
incredibly thin and toned, and 
these same women are taught to 
work rigorously to achieve their 
goals by any means possible. 
While it’s obviously healthy to 
exercise and eat well, excessive 
habits in any form become 
problematic 
quickly. This 
is 

occasionally apparent in the 
young women who go to the 
gym seven days a week without 
fail, who’ve vowed to cut sugar 
and carbohydrates entirely from 
their diets. (I cannot and do not 
wish to define what is or should 
be considered “healthy” because 
that term is purely subjective. 
What is healthy for some may not 
be for others. This subjectivity is 
the kryptonite of dealing with 
eating disorders.)

But when this behavior is 

flaunted and praised, as it often 
is on college campuses, we 
come to consider it as the ideal. 
While for many this lifestyle is 
healthy and at times necessary 
for mental well-being, this is 
not universally the case. When 
subjective methods are applied 
objectively, problems arise. The 
adoption of a strict diet and 
exercise regimen may result in 
significant bodily and mental 
change for some, and not for 
others, 
thus 
perpetuating 

distress among young women 

who are so desperately striving 
for physical perfection.

Even 
further, 
there 
is 

certainly a class divide between 
those who are and are not able 
to afford gym memberships 
and health foods, which are 
considered necessary for these 
idealistically healthy lifestyles. 
The 
distress 
of 
lacking 

requisite resources to attain 
this bodily ideal is greater than 
is immediately visible, and the 
various racial, cultural and 
class-based setbacks to young 
women attempting to achieve 
this ideal are innumerable.

So we ask ourselves, “How 

do 
we 
change 
this?” 
One 

possible immediate response is 
simply to call for more realistic 
representation in media or to 
advertise healthier, less extreme 
lifestyles. But these solutions fail 
to account for the damage that is 
already done. What’s more, this 
norm is already perpetuated by 
the young women it affects and 
those around them.

I do believe that, over time, 

bodily ideals can be modified 
into 
more 
attainable 
and 

inclusive forms on a global 
scale. However, change such as 
this does not happen overnight, 
and there are more personal 
and individualistic efforts that 
can be made in the meantime. 
Instead, I argue, we should 
utilize 
mindfulness. 
Do 
not 

discuss with your friends how 
little or how much you’ve eaten 
that day. Do not boast how much 
weight you’ve lost or gained 
in the past week. By focusing 
less on physical aspects of 
one another, we can end the 
personal perpetuation of these 
potentially harmful ideals and 
simultaneously focus on aspects 
of our peers that do not need to 
be changed by diet restrictions 
and 
gym 
memberships. 
Be 

mindful of how others might 
perceive your words. What 
seems harmless to you may not 
seem so innocent to another.

O

ver 
the 
past 
eight 

years, 
our 
country 

has gone through a 

lot, from mass shootings and 
arguments over gun control 
to 
human 
rights 

crises such as the 
Flint water crisis 
and 
the 
Dakota 

Access 
Pipeline 

protests. Maybe it’s 
just because of the 
consistent flow of 
media making us 
aware of everything 
wrong in the world, 
but times have been 
tough 
lately. 
But 

when it comes to 
the issues of racism and police 
brutality, there was no better 
president to be in office than 
Barack Obama.

Obama’s 
campaign 
from 

2008 seems like a distant 
memory to some, but the slogan 
“Change we can believe in” and 
the chant “Yes We Can” still 
ring loudly in my memory and 
have remained applicable for 
both his terms. I remember 
watching his inauguration in 
my seventh-grade science class 
and feeling such an aura of 
positivity and hope.

It personally meant so much 

to me because someone like me 
(mixed, born to a Black father 
and a white mother) was the 
most important man in the 
country and perhaps the world. 
Who knows when or if that 
will happen again. He was a 
president whom I felt I could 
relate to, who made me laugh 
and smile and cheer him on.

He 
set 
a 
beautiful 

example of a loving, devoted 
husband, father and public 
servant, combating the many 
unfortunate 
stereotypes 

attributed to Black men. He 
didn’t come from a privileged 
background 
and 
faced 

discrimination throughout his 

life, whether he was going to 
a predominately white high 
school in Hawaii or becoming 
the first Black president of the 
Harvard Law Review. He rose 

to the top position 
in the country as a 
Black man, giving 
faith to many that 
they 
can 
achieve 

great things (though 
that isn’t possible 
for 
all, 
especially 

with vast disparities 
in the quality of 
living 
conditions 

and education we’re 
born into).

Obama 
was 
a 

symbol of hope for many 
Americans, especially Black 
citizens, 
and 
certainly 
for 

myself when racial tensions 
were high. No matter the result 
of the most recent election, 
a clear divide has emerged, 
polarizing us to two sides: 
whether 
you 
believe 
race 

relations and racism are still 
prevalent in the country or not.

From my perspective, racism 

can be covert but is still a large 
issue in our country. There 
has been a disproportionate 
number 
of 
Black 
people 

shot by police compared to 
whites, a clear mistreatment 
of Black people all over the 
news and a disregard of the 
fears and feelings of people 
who are afraid of what could 
potentially happen to them or 
their loved ones.

On the nights when I prayed 

that my father or sister would 
be safe and mourned for the 
men and women who have lost 
their lives because of profiling 
or oppression, Obama was a 
symbol of hope for me. I had 
a 
president 
that 
probably 

was mourning over the same 
issues. He shed a tear when 
the Sandy Hook Elementary 
School shooting happened and 

displayed empathy whenever 
a tragedy struck our country. 
And he didn’t just mourn — he 
used his words to bring us all 
together and attempted to use 
his position to pass laws, such 
as the curbing of gun usage.

In the beginning of July, after 

the wrongful death of Philando 
Castile, Obama’s words hit the 
nail on the head about why 
everyone should care that there 
are people dying in the streets 
at the hands of police: “When 
incidents 
like 
this 
occur, 

there is a big chunk of our 
fellow citizenry that feels as 
if because of the color of their 
skin they are not being treated 
the same. And that hurts. And 
that should trouble all of us.” 
This was a president who got it 
and gave extensive statements 
on the topic, not shying away 
from it or dismissing it like 
other politicians.

I smiled at pictures giving 

us glimpses of Obama’s life 
at the White House, such as 
when he hysterically laughed 
at a baby dressed as the pope. I 
felt empowered listening to his 
State of the Union addresses 
as he used his gift of public 
speaking to comfort the nation. 
I know that there’s nearly half 
the country that voted against 
him and perhaps many view him 
unfavorably, but I think there’s 
an argument to be made that he 
is one of the most personable 
presidents we’ve ever had. And 
that side of him is what we 
needed at times. We needed a 
president to make us laugh and 
tell us the reality of situations 
while guiding us through them 
with poise and empathy.

All in all, I’m overjoyed that 

my president looked like me. 
It’s not just that — he cared like 
me, too.

Resolutions for every year

ANTHONY COZART | OP-ED

I

n an episode of “Master of 
None,” the Netflix comedy 
produced by and starring 

Aziz Ansari, there’s a scene 
where a colleague of Ansari’s 
character, 
Dev, 
introduces 

himself to Dev’s friends at a New 
York City bar. The colleague only 
addresses the men at the table, 
which Dev’s romantic partner 
Rachel, played by Noël Wells, 
reacts to immediately. She points 
out the colleague had treated 
her and the other women in the 
group as if they were invisible. 
Dev and his male friends brush 
it off, making up excuses: Dev’s 
colleague was in a hurry, people 
aren’t so awful and they’re 
overreacting.

Two things stand out in the 

scene: the initial sexist, if subtle, 
act by Dev’s colleague and the 
men’s reactions. The men tell 
Rachel and the other women, 
who have just experienced the 
sexist act, that they’re wrong. 
They (and their excuses) reject 
their female friends’ perceptions 
of what just happened and how 
they’re treated more generally. 
Later, Rachel describes what 
this is like: “When somebody, 
especially my boyfriend, tells me 
that I’m wrong without having 
any way of knowing my personal 
experience, it’s insulting.” 

Watching the episode over 

winter break made me think 
more about the experiences of my 
female friends and classmates. 
In the fall, a close friend told 
me that almost the same scene 
and 
treatment 
happened 
to 

her. I’d also heard from others 
about colleagues who regularly 
“mansplain” and about similar 
subtle sexist acts. Apart from 
listening to and encouraging my 
friends after the incidents, I’d 
done little to help.

Like many people, during the 

holidays I also began to consider 
resolutions for the New Year. 
How can I be happier, healthier 
and more successful in 2017? 
While I’ve adopted resolutions 
with this question in mind, I’ve 
also included several addressing 
the 
sexism 
and 
misogyny 

displayed in the “Master of 
None” scene. They’re resolutions 
that we (men, on campus and 
more generally) should keep: 
to avoid these common sexist 
acts, however small, subtle or 
unintended, 
to 
support 
our 

peers, interjecting instead of 
justifying the offense (as Dev did 
in the episode) and to intervene 
whenever possible.

The episode is powerful, in part, 

because it demonstrates these 
acts are ubiquitous and happen 
even in progressive bubbles of 
Manhattan (and Ann Arbor). Like 
the characters in the episode, I’m a 
feminist in principle, likely because 
of my mother’s experiences as a 
leading female lawyer. And while I 
try to be conscious of what I say and 
do toward others — for example, 
by avoiding using stereotypes and 
gendered terms — I’ve found and 
seen how it can be easy to make 
these mistakes. Last week, while 
walking with a female colleague 

to teach our first classes of the 
semester, I made a quick comment 
that, 
while 
well 
intentioned, 

may have sounded demeaning, 
however slight.

How 
can 
we 
keep 
these 

resolutions?

To start, we can stop and stand 

up to “mansplaining,” the not-at-
all subtle or insignificant practice 
of men explaining to others, 
often women, a topic or idea in 
a condescending or patronizing 
way. According to research on 
team building, listening to and 
respecting 
others 
makes 
us 

more successful. (I also plan to 
read more, including the book 
“Men Explain Things to Me,” by 
Rebecca Solnit.)

Another way is to cut out the 

jokes — which are often online and 
justified as “trolling.” At the end of 
last semester, a female classmate 
posted a reminder to Facebook 
about using gendered language 
in instructor evaluations. One of 
my male peers commented “No.” 
Whether joking or not, in doing 
so he delegitimized her point. 
Someone should have responded, 
yet no one did. On the same 
topic, we can abstain from using 
gendered terms and slurs in our 
conversations and messages.

We can stop talking over, 

crowding 
out, 
discounting, 

bulldozing and interrupting our 
female classmates. We can reflect 
on what we said, saw and heard 
in 2016 and when we should 
have stood up for others. We 
can commit to holding our peers 
more accountable, to act in ways 
that reflect our beliefs. And we 
can listen to, learn from, help and 
support our female peers, this 
year and in the future.

‘A Monster Calls’ merits
mockery for mediocrity

J.A. Bayona’s latest feature tramples over premise by painting

in broad strokes and capitalizing in tired, indulgent clichés

“Stories are wild creatures,” 

a CGI tree monster tells 
a young British lad in an 
otherwise 
tranquil 
home 

somewhere 
in 

the meandering 
middle 
of 
“A 

Monster Calls,” 
the latest film 
from 
Spanish 

director 
J.A. 

Bayona 
(“The 

Impossible”). 
The 
monster, 

voiced 
by 

Liam 
Neeson 

(“Silence”), comes at night 
to 
tell 
stories 
to 
a 
boy, 

Conor 
(Lewis 
MacDougall, 

“Pan”), who is confronting 
his 
mother’s 
impending 

death from cancer. Conor’s 
father lives in America and 
his grandmother, his new 
guardian, is more strict than 

caring. At school, he’s bullied 
by his classmates and picked 
on by his teacher.

In other words, Conor’s not 

all right. And the monster, 
armed with a gnarly Northern 
Irish voice and formed from the 
old yew tree in the cemetery 
across the glen, coaches the 
kid to be brave through telling 
three fairy tales, two of which 
are stunningly rendered in 
watercolor 
animation. 
The 

message is clear: Stories are 

important because they teach 
us valuable lessons about life’s 
complexities. The shame in 
including this conceit in “A 
Monster Calls” is that while 
screenwriter and source book 
author Patrick Ness (“Class”) 
puts a premium on the power 

of 
stories, 
his 

story itself lacks 
the 
structure 

and 
potency 

to 
salvage 
the 

film 
from 
an 

onslaught 
of 

poor choices.

Even 
more 

frustrating 
is 

that 
what 
one 

garners to be the 

purpose of the stories — to 
teach that life is complex, that 
there are no easy answers — 
is directly repudiated by the 
simplicity of the characters 
on screen. While Conor, an 
avid and talented artist, draws 
effervescent images of his 
world, Bayona and Ness draw 
in rather wide, bland strokes.

Conor’s 
mother 
(Felicity 

Jones, “Rogue One: A Star 
Wars Story”) is a Dying Family 
Member With Cancer, rapidly 
diminishing, hopeless, soft-
spoken and flawless save for 
a malignant tumor. We’ve 
seen this before, too many 
times. Conor’s grandmother, 
an abnormally off Sigourney 
Weaver (“Avatar”), is just cruel 
and cold, concerned more with 
her house’s orderly appearance 
than her grandson’s sanity. 
Conor’s bully lashes out at 
our protagonist continually, 
for no reason other than that 
Conor is consumed by his art 
during classes. He’s beat up 
outside the school on multiple 
occasions, and his schooling 
life is reduced entirely to this 
two-handed relationship, as if 
they two are the only students 
at the school.

The film, overstuffed with 

both platitudes and extraneous 
thematic vehicles like Conor’s 
art and the stories and the 

monster 
itself, 
becomes 

something 
of 
a 
mockery 

of its central idea. Stories 
surely 
have 
transformative 

potential, 
but 
“A 
Monster 

Calls” is not one of those 
stories. Nor are the monster’s, 
but they at least get credit for 
being jaw-dropping in their 
realization. These fairy tales, 
dreamlike 
and 
captivating, 

provide all-too-brief respites 
from the utter blandness of 
the 
story 
that 
practically 

serves 
as 
their 
bookends. 

They’re pure cinematic candy 
but suffer from a dearth of 
groundbreaking lessons. Life 
doesn’t have easy answers, 
things are confusing and it’s 
all right to make mistakes. We 
get it.

I fear this film may matter 

or mean more for individuals 
older 
and 
younger 
than 

myself, but that should only 
serve to diminish its quality. 
The 
specific 
is 
universal 

insofar as that specific world 
is 
constructed 
to 
lifelike 

specifications. 
“A 
Monster 

Calls” 
is 
cinematic 
dog-

whistle politics, a tale about 
grief told in ways only those 
who have unfortunately and 
severely experienced it would 
truly understand.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

The ethics of the sneaker business is marred with ambiguity

Sneakers have been an inte-

gral part of fashion for longer 
than I have been alive. There 
are hyped-up sneakers being 
released every month and, if you 
are lucky enough to buy a pair, 
the resale price can be astro-
nomical. It’s not unheard of to 
make upwards of a 200 percent 
profit on a pair of sneakers. I 
remember when I was successful 
in purchasing a pair of the Pirate 
Black Yeezy Boost 350 sneakers 
for about $200. I was extremely 
excited to wear them, but I felt 
the need to satiate my curiosity 
and looked at the resale prices 
for my pair. When I saw that I 
could realize a 300 percent profit 
by selling them, I was no longer 
able to look at my sneakers as 
$200 shoes but rather $800 ones 
— I had to sell them.

Some people have even turned 

sneaker resale into a full-time 
job. Recently, a man named Allen 
Kuo entered the spotlight of the 
sneaker 
community, 
posting 

pictures with about 100 pairs 
of the Yeezy 750 Boost sneakers 
released in June of 2016. For ref-
erence, the retail price on these 
sneakers is about $350 and the 
resale price according to StockX, 
a reputable site for finding a fair 
price for resale sneakers, is about 
$950. Some quick math tells you 
that Allen is making at mini-
mum $60,000 on the release of 
a single pair of sneakers (he has 
the sneakers posted on his site 
for $2,000, so he may be seeing 

even more in profits from this 
venture). This isn’t the only pair 
of shoes that he has gotten en 
masse this year: Kuo has posted 
pictures on his Instagram with 
other coveted Yeezys and Jor-
dans whose resale values have 
surely shown him many more 
thousands in profits.

Kuo is not unique in this ven-

ture, though. For every Allen 
Kuo in the sneaker game there 
is also a twenty-something year-
old kid with a “plug” who posts 
on every Facebook buy/sell/trade 
group that you’re a part of that 
they have ten pairs of the new 
sneakers for sale at, maybe, a 250 
percent markup. Sneaker bots 
have also been around for many 
years. A bot essentially functions 
as an “add-to-cart” service for 
prospective sneaker purchasers. 
These script packages capital-
ize on the fact that humans can 
only type in their shipping infor-
mation so fast and, that by the 
time an ordinary customer has 
finished typing in their 16-digit 
credit card number and billing 
address, a customer with an ATC 
service has already successfully 
checked out, or “jacked” their 
cart. Retailers consistently claim 
to be working to stop the efficacy 
of bots, but release after sub-
sequent release show that even 
sites as large as Foot Locker sim-
ply cannot stay ahead of the ATC 
developers. It doesn’t stop with 
sneakers either, large brands like 
Supreme and Palace see the same 
thing happening. A Supreme 
box-logo hoodie (yes, a sweat-
shirt that simply has an embroi-

dery with the brand’s name) can 
retail for around $150 and will 
sell on sites like Grailed for four-
times that amount within a few 
hours of the posting.

A question that I have strug-

gled to answer for myself, even 
in the context of my single pair 
of Yeezys, is the whether or not 
it is fair to use these methods as 
a means of making money. The 
answer that I have been able to 
come up with is a resounding 
“maybe.” I’ve realized that the 
reason why everyone cannot get 
a pair of coveted sneakers or a 
hoodie is not due to the fact that 
full-time resellers are hoarding 
them, but rather because the sup-
ply does not meet the demand. 
Regardless of whether someone 
like Kuo buys all 1,000 pairs of a 
hyped release or if 1,000 distinct 
purchasers are able to buy them, 
the resale market will still exist 
and sellers will still actualize 
greater gains on a pair of sneak-
ers than even some of the riskiest 
stock options. Sure, some people 
may be able to purchase a pair of 
shoes that they intend on keep-
ing if bots are banned. But, I am 
sure that there are plenty of peo-
ple like me who can’t turn down 
a quick buck. I could go into the 
intricacies of a marginal-benefit 
/ marginal-cost analysis, but in 
the end all that will show is that 
even though there are some peo-
ple who are barred from the sec-
ondhand market because of their 
willingness-to-pay, markets will 
still clear and retailers really 
have minimal incentive to do 
anything about bots and plugs.

NARESH IYENGAR

For The Daily

This week Daily Music writers 

look back at — and reconsider — 
less modern pieces of music.

Folk music intersects with 

popular music in interesting ways. 
Classic artists like Woody Guth-
rie, Johnny Cash and most of all 
Bob Dylan have taken root in the 
hearts of fans for generations, and 
today the genre is being freshly 
interpreted 
by 
contemporary 

popular artists as disparate as Bon 
Iver, Fleet Foxes and the Avett 
Brothers. Folk has had its notable 
moments, both on the charts of 
popular music and in coverage 
by major publications. But as an 
umbrella with many subgenres, 
it has also seen more than its fair 
share of artists falling through the 
cracks into obscurity.

John Prine falls somewhere in 

the middle here: He is celebrated 
among folk fans and music critics 
alike, but isn’t widely known in the 
popular sphere. When I mention 
him in conversation to my friend 
who listens to folk music or ask 
for his music at a record store, his 
name is recognized instantly, but 
in most other conversations, it is 
met with blank stares. His catalog 
is almost as extensive as Dylan’s, 
and his songwriting abilities have 
been the source of consistent criti-
cal praise since his eponymous 
debut album in 1971, yet his name 
becomes less generally recogniz-
able with every passing year.

This may be because he has 

failed to produce any chart-top-
ping singles to launch him into 
public attention. Many songs, like 
John Denver’s “Take Me Home, 
Country Roads” and Old Crow 
Medicine Show’s “Wagon Wheel,” 
have left a significant enough 
impact on the general public to 
preserve their artists’ names in 
history indefinitely. Curiously, no 
single song has done this for John 
Prine, which may account for his 
relative deficit in popular recogni-
tion.

This deficit could also be attrib-

uted to Prine’s lyrics. Many of his 
songs are historically specific, 
such as 1971’s “Paradise,” which 
describes the takeover of a small 
Kentucky town by a coal company. 
These songs derive some mean-
ing from context, and Prine often 
approaches their subjects with 
angles of humor, political criti-
cism, or both. This narrow, spe-
cific style of execution, and the 
necessity of context here, may be a 
few of the reasons Prine is looked 
back on less frequently than some 
of his peers. It sometimes takes a 
certain mood to appreciate these 
qualities, which can reasonably 
set them in contrast against the 
often more widely relatable songs 
of Cash or Dylan. But these specif-
ic lyrics are used to tell stories that 
hold true emotionally even when 
removed from the context of his-
tory, and they are among the many 
traits that make him interesting as 
a songwriter.

Folk music has some history in 

political protest, and Prine car-

ries on this tradition in his music 
with a markedly humorous twist, 
often fixating on characters whose 
extreme stories reflect ridiculous 
aspects of our own lives. In his 
early song “Your Flag Decal Won’t 
Get You Into Heaven Anymore,” 
he calls commercial patriotism 
into question, narrating the story 
of a man who crashes his car due 
to the American flag stickers 
covering his windshield. With 
its cheerful tone and hyperbolic 
ending, it is easy to see how a nar-
rative like this would fit along-
side Dylan’s “Talkin’ John Birch 
Paranoid Blues,” or Phil Ochs’s 
“Love Me, I’m a Liberal.” Some-
times Prine’s music focuses exclu-
sively on humor — like in 1973’s 
“Dear Abby,” a satire of advice 
columns — and sometimes it lays 
the humor aside in favor of a more 
serious political tone, like in his 
2005 song “Some Humans Ain’t 
Human,” which criticizes Presi-
dent George W. Bush for invasion 
of Iraq.

Prine is a peculiar case in the 

timeline of American folk music. 
His personality is unassuming, 
and his songs have consistently 
occupied modest but dignified 
positions on popular music charts 
since the early seventies. But 
despite his lack of mainstream 
popularity, his songs offer elo-
quent, natural and at times 
humorous perspectives on the 
world, and given his lyrical abili-
ties and his lasting influence, 
he continues to occupy a crucial 
place in the world of folk music 
today.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

Once, Anna Wintour made 

eye contact with me and I 
almost peed.

That’s the story I tell when 

people ask me what I do “on 
the job.” In one month, I will be 
headed back to Manhattan for my 
fifth season interning at New York 
Fashion Week. As always, I am hes-
itant to tell those around me where 
I’m really going for those seven 
February days, for fear of being 
pinned a “humble-bragger,” or 
receiving endless coos of unjust 
admiration and jealousy. When 
I tell people I’m working Fashion 
Week, they seem to overlook the 
“working” part entirely, so I just 
give them what I know they want 
— juicy little anecdotes without 
any substance, like my lackluster 
Wintour encounter. In the eyes of 
many of my friends, I’ll be skipping 
school this February to attend a 
star-studded affair in Manhattan. 
Though they aren’t technically 
wrong, a few key aspects of my 
work at NYFW consistently go 
unnoticed.

I pay my own way. I spend 

my own money on my own 
flights to my own unpaid job. I 
have worked other jobs, saved 
money from gifts and sold my 
old clothes so that I can accom-
modate my internships. I am 
not asking for pity — I come 
from an upper-middle-class 
family where money has never 
been an issue, and therefore 
have the rare opportunity to 
pursue ventures that involve 
little-to-no pay. Rather, I am 
trying to shed light on an 
industry that outsiders (and 
even some insiders) view as 
full of unrestrained glamour 
and drama. From my vantage 
point, it’s easy to see that fash-
ion is full of humility. It is a 
universe populated by everyone 
from artists to models to pro-
duction specialists. No matter 
their trade, each individual is 
controlled by a select few cor-
porate giants, generally under-

paid unless they manage to 
make it big.

Be it New York, London, 

Milan or Paris, Fashion Week 
sucks the life out of everyone 
involved. No matter their job, 
anyone who has ever worked 
a Fashion Week could tell you 
that it is a grueling seven days, 
both physically and mentally. 
Though I have worked two very 
different jobs over the course of 
my NYFW career — social media 
correspondent for a modeling 
agency and celebrity escort for 
a backstage lounge — each left 
me with a maximum of four 
hours of sleep a night and a 
brutal cold by the end of the 
week. Not even the most beau-
tiful models are exempt from 
the ubiquitous Fashion Week 
eye bags (I always joke that 
mine are Prada). Emergen-C 

tablets are given out at every 
venue like souvenirs. Each of 
us works vigorously in hopes 
of fulfilling traditionally unre-
alistic deadlines. All the while, 
we must elicit stylishness, our 
faces blotted and our outfits 
impeccably chic, to ensure that 
bystanders view Fashion Week 
as the elitist affair it pretends 
to be. We may not be doctors or 
lawyers, but that doesn’t make 
the fashion industry any less 
invested 
and, 
subsequently, 

overworked.

Save for Us Weekly, nobody tells 

you that stars truly are just like us, 
even during NYFW. In fact, affili-

ated publications likely don’t want 
you to know how “normal” many 
celebrities are despite their cir-
cumstances. After all, media out-
lets receive most of their Fashion 
Week related traction from celebri-
ties who use their online platforms 
to create a covetable facade of a life. 
In September of 2016, headlines 
noted that Kylie Jenner sat front 
row at Prabal Gurung’s show, but 
failed to mention that she was likely 
being paid to attend, another shift 
of her extremely well-rewarded, 
yet never-ending job. Season after 
season, blogger Leandra Medine of 
Man Repeller is regularly featured 
in magazines’s “street style” broad-
casts, yet none show the young 
businesswoman hurriedly jetting 
from show to show, taking rushed 
sips of Blue Bottle coffee (a NYFW 
staple — ask anybody) as though 
she fears her cup will run away. The 
same principle reigns when applied 
to celebrities’s most down-to-earth 
behaviors. When Jenna Lyons, 
creative director and president of 
J. Crew, asked for a photo with a 
lowly intern (i.e. me) after a show at 
Milk Studios, not one reporter took 
notice. Like many other human 
beings, Lyons did not feel comfort-
able having solo shots taken that 
day, and instead opted to use me as 
a means of diverting the spotlight, 
if even for a moment. That kind of 
raw humanity does not jive well 
with the image of Lyons contrived 
by the media — intimidatingly 
stern and all business — and so they 
simply left it out. In the most frank 
of terms, envy and fear make New 
York Fashion Week profitable.

It’s true — Anna Wintour is 

scary, and capable of evoking 
involuntary bodily functions. 
But New York Fashion Week is 
more than a brush with fame, 
or even clothes on a runway. 
It is practically its own being, 
layered with great and poor 
qualities alike. It jerks real 
tears out of its victims, but 
always winds up giving them 
some of the most memorable 
experiences of their lives. That 
— you know I had to end this 
way — is something that will 
never go out of style.

SIMON & SCHUSTER

Tilikum died how he lived, a prisoner of human greed and need for spectacle. 
‘Loner’ a pertinent read

In 2015, Brock Turner, a 

freshman at Stanford Univer-
sity, was found atop an uncon-
scious female, hidden behind 
a dumpster, by two passing 
cyclists. The girl, whose name 
was never revealed, later testi-
fied to being unconscious, as 
did the cyclists who found her. 
She didn’t remember Turner 
and she didn’t remember initi-
ating any sexual activity with 
him. She woke up with dried 
blood on her body and pine 
needles in her hair.

Turner, behind a barrier of 

well-paid attorneys, told a dif-
ferent story: one of a typical 
college romance that springs 
from 
alcohol-fueled 
college 

parties. He said they left hold-
ing hands, she had slipped and 
then they kissed. A fairytale 
romance, it must have been, 
especially for the girl who woke 
up with blood on her body and 
pine needles in her hair.

In recent years, these stories 

have become more and more 
familiar in the media sphere. 
Fraternity parties that lead to 
outrageously high blood alco-
hol content and girls with the 
word “no” floating on their lips 
— these are a formula, espe-
cially at universities, that we 
all know too well. And all too 
often they end in six months 
leave — three, if the perpetra-
tor displays “good behavior.”

But take away the alcohol 

and add obsession. Remove 
the darkness and stickiness 
of a fraternity basement, and 
add the ivy walls of Harvard 
University. Take away lowered 
inhibitions and add agency, and 
we get Teddy Wayne’s “Loner,” 
a story told from the point of 
view of David Federman, an 
incoming freshman at Harvard. 
A boy who never stood out 
and was always pushed aside 
in high school, David yearns 
to be someone special, and 

he believes that Harvard will 
grant him this.

The first day of school, David 

sees Veronica, a girl so utterly 
perfect in his mind’s eye that 
he idealizes and romanticizes 
every aspect of her. He seeks 
out her classes and stages casu-
al run-ins just to glimpse at her. 
He enrolls in the same classes 
and eagerly writes entire essays 
for her. She comes from an 
entirely different world than he 
does, one taken from the heart 
of Upper East Side Manhattan 
and all the freedom and riches 
which that upbringing affords.

And so David fixates, and he 

follows. The entire novel, read-
ers are buried deep in David’s 
thoughts, seeing and thinking 
everything he is. And what is 
so attracting about his char-
acter is that we find ourselves 
rooting for him. His unsettling 
knack for manipulating Sarah, 
his girlfriend and Veronica’s 
roommate, is disturbing and 
occasionally 
upsetting, 
but 

often swept aside as excusable 
due to her presentation as an 
obnoxious and whiny creature. 
His fixation on Veronica, which 
escalates to an unnatural and 
violent degree, comes across 
as a simple crush for most of 
the novel. She encourages; he 
reacts. She speaks; he follows. It 
is the obsession that stems from 
the romanticization of those we 
adore. It is a crush that anyone 
who has ever waded through a 
stranger’s Facebook page can 
understand.

Remember, this is all told 

from 
David’s 
perspective. 

He is an intelligent boy who 
worked hard enough in high 
school to get into Harvard on 
merit alone. His presumed air 
of intelligence is what defines 
him, and ultimately reveals to 
the reader the unsettling nature 
of how this boy sees himself in 
comparison to those around 
him. He is intellectual elitism 
at its worst. When his essay is 
praised by a professor in class, 
he entertains grand fantasies 
of becoming this teacher’s TA 
before the semester ends. He 
assumes an air of superiority 
towards his roommate and his 
girlfriend despite having come 
from the high school lunch 
table of rejects and loners. His 
elitism and entitlement runs 
rampant on a campus where 
half the students are bred 
from and raised in families of 
those exact character flaws. 

Even they though can’t seem to 
ascend to the same height of his 
self-made pedestal.

Left alone, these faults form 

the vision of a narcissistic boy 
who has never been told he is 
wrong. When placed beside 
Veronica, he appears as the 
underdog, the nerd, trying to 
get his hands on the cool, chic 
girl who always rejected him 
in high school. And David is 
simultaneously both of these 
people, but with a twisted and 
self-righteous 
agency 
that 

eventually leads him to a simi-
lar position as Brock Turner — 
a man hiding behind a barrier 
of well-paid attorneys.

Remember, this is all told 

from David’s perspective. The 
unnatural nature of his crush, 
though unsettling at times and 
increasingly so, never reveals 
to us the nature of the boy in 
whose head we rest and rely. It 
is an extreme case of the unreli-
able nature that leaves the flesh 
crawling and stomach turned, 
because it is a narrator in whom 

we lend our ears, eyes and mind 
to, only to be betrayed.

Harvard has faced a great 

deal of criticism in recent 
years. Alumni fear the asso-
ciation and rivals look at it not 
with disdain, but pity because 
of the aforementioned criti-
cism. As scandal after scandal 
has emerged the school has 
been able to do little to redeem 
itself, and Wayne, a Harvard 
grad himself, only draws this 
scandal into a more critical 
light. By placing readers inside 
the protagonist’s mind, readers 
have a first-account insight into 
the mind of a loner — a loner 
impaled on the stake of white 
privilege and entitlement that 
has brought unwanted criti-
cism to the country’s oldest and 
most esteemed institution. An 
institution, just like Stanford, 
awash in scandal that will come 
to taint the university’s legacy, 
both past and present.

Wolverines return to Crisler to face 
Nebraska and head coach Tim Miles

Though the conference season 

is still young, few teams in the 
country have had a better stretch 
of 
games 
in 

the past couple 
weeks 
than 

Nebraska.

After 
a 

bumpy 
non-

conference 
slate 
that 

included a loss 
to 
Gardner-

Webb, 
the 

Cornhuskers 
(3-1 Big Ten, 
9-6 
overall) 

have 
found 

new life and 
been the surprise of the Big Ten 
thus far in conference play.

Nebraska has earned road wins 

at Indiana and Maryland, and 

will look to add a win at Crisler 
Center to its resume when it faces 
Michigan (1-3, 11-6) on Saturday.

Senior guard Tai Webster has 

led the Cornhuskers’ resurgence. 
The senior is currently the fourth-
highest scorer in the Big Ten, 
averaging 17.7 points, while also 
producing four assists per game.

Stopping Webster and the 

rest of the offense will be a high 
priority for the Wolverines, and 
based on some news this week, 
that job may be easier than 
Michigan originally anticipated.

Nebraska forward Ed Morrow 

has been ruled out indefinitely 
with a foot injury. Morrow 
currently leads Nebraska with 
7.9 rebounds per game, and was 
one of three sophomores who 
started for the Cornhuskers in 
their last outing, a home loss to 
Northwestern.

The Daily sat down with 

Nebraska coach Tim Miles at 

Big Ten Media Day in October to 
discuss his young roster and his 
relationship with Michigan coach 
John Beilein and the rest of the 
conference’s coaches:

The Michigan Daily: What 

should fans expect when they’re 
watching “Nebrasketball” this 
year?

Tim Miles: I like our group. 

We’re young and there are some 
real unknowns because eight 
of our top 10 guys are freshmen 
and sophomores or new. I think 
if we can handle ourselves, if we 
can get off to a really solid start, 
that will bode well for us. Last 
year we played 21 games in this 
league. We were 8-13. There was 
a .2 difference between our points 
against and our points scored per 
game. That’s insane. It just tells 
you about the depth of our league.

TMD: What comes to your 

mind when you see these stats 
and realize how close you are in 

so many games?

TM: I immediately go, what 

are we weak on defensively? What 
are we weak on offense? How 
can we correct that? What can 
we get better at? For this year, I 
don’t think there’s any way we’re 
going to make as many threes as 
we made last year, so where are 
we going to get our points from? 
But at the same time I think we’re 
going to defend the three much 
better. So scoring might be down 
on both sides, but if it’s more 
favorable for us, I don’t care.

TMD: Can you give us some 

insight into what goes on at the 
coaches’ dinner before media day?

TM: We go out and all have 

a nice dinner with the coaches. 
Quite frankly, Coach Beilein, 
who should be a good friend of 
mine because we’re both St. Louis 
Cardinals fans, was upset with 
me because I don’t follow the 
Cardinals as closely as he does. I 
also have young kids, and I’m not 
as veteran a guy as he is — which 
means old. If I’m not paying 
attention to what the Cardinals’ 
rotation is this week, he’s mad. 
He’s just sensitive.

TMD: Do you call or text Beilein 

about the Cardinals frequently?

TM: I will text him and on 

occasion he will text me back. I’m 
a true Cardinals fan. John Beilein, 
I don’t know. He’s like my father 
who listens to every game, lives 
and dies with them.

TMD: Does your relationship 

with Beilein reflect the dynamic 
between all the Big Ten coaches?

TM: No question. I think 

there’s a great relationship. Guys 
are highly competitive, yet no one 
is easily insulted so you can give 
each other a hard time. We got a 
lot of energetic guys, and some 
guys aren’t. You look at a calm guy 
like Coach Beilein and, when you 
get to know him, he’s a passionate 
person about things. If you 
were just a common viewer, you 
wouldn’t see that every day. I love 
our league. I love the coaches.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan seeks to 
extend home streak

This weekend, the Michigan 

women’s basketball team (3-1 Big 
Ten, 14-4 overall) will be looking 
to 
defend 
its 

undefeated 
9-0 
streak 
at 

Crisler 
Center 

this season. The 
Wolverines will 
be 
squaring 

off 
against 

Minnesota (1-3, 
10-7) on Sunday, 
the only contest 
between the two 
teams this year.

The 

Wolverines are coming off a hot 
win against Indiana, something 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
attributes to focus. 

“We have a lot of growth (this 

season),” Thome said. “And to pull 
it out against a Big Ten team is 
something special. To pull it out 
means we’re still locked in at the 
game and locked in throughout 
the entire game to be able to take 
away what (the opposing team) 
wants to do.”

Michigan has been averaging 

83.7 points per game on 49.2 
percent shooting at home, and 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
has done most of the damage. 
Flaherty has 1,614 career points 
and stands fourth all-time at 
Michigan, though she is just 33 
points away from overtaking 
Trish Andrew, who played from 
1989-93, for third place.

The last time the Wolverines 

faced 
the 
Golden 
Gophers, 

Michigan 
swept 
Minnesota 

and ended the Golden Gophers’ 
three-game winning streak in the 
series — the record stands with 
Minnesota in the lead, 34-27. This 
year, Minnesota is coming off an 
88-point performance in a win 
against Wisconsin, but it hasn’t 
played a game in over a week

Notably, the Golden Gophers 

hold a 31-4 record when scoring 
at least 80 points. The Wolverines 
will try to stop them from 

reaching that number, most likely 
with the help of Thome and junior 
guard Jillian Dunston. Thome 
boasts 129 total rebounds on the 
season, and Dunston leads by one 
with 130. 

Thome has been praised for 

her dominant performances since 
conference play started. She has 
notched two double-doubles in 
the past four games and anchors 
Michigan on both the defensive 
and offensive ends, averaging 20.3 
points per game. 

She currently ranks sixth in 

the conference in scoring, and 
is shooting 69 percent from the 
floor. 

Thome has started all 18 games 

this season, along with Flaherty, 
Dunston and senior guard Siera 
Thompson. New to the starting 
lineup is freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick, 
who 
is 
quickly 

becoming one of Thome’s biggest 
allies on the court. 

“I trust her,” Gondrezick said. 

“I trust all my teammates. I know 
one thing that I do well is getting 
the ball to my teammates to make 
everyone else around me better —
something (Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico) stresses all the time.

“It allows Thome to be visible 

and present; it definitely is a game 
changer in the interior.” 

Yet, Minnesota’s offense is 

nothing to scoff at. The Golden 
Gophers hold two of the Big Ten’s 
top-11 scorers in guards Carlie 
Wagner and Kenisha Bell. Wagner 
and Bell are averaging 18.2 points 
per game and 17.3, respectively. 

This is Barnes Arico’s fifth 

season as head coach, and her 
record at home is an impressive 
59-22. The key to this season’s 
success has been its ability to 
dominate competition in the first 
10 minutes of the second half. 
The Wolverines have outscored 
opponents, 229-108, in that time. 

But as far as Barnes Arico is 

concerned for this game—and 
future games — she’s repeating 
one mantra about the team’s 
performance. 

“Keep it going. Just keep it 

going.”

‘M’ set to resume season in Minnesota 

The last time the Michigan 

hockey team faced off against 
Minnesota was in March of 2016, 
when 
the 

Wolverines 
left the ice in 
Minneapolis 
as 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
champions 
after 
a 
5-3 

win 
over 

the 
Golden 

Gophers.

This 

weekend, 
in 
their 

first 
series 

matchup 
of 

the season, the 
Wolverines 
will travel to Mariucci Arena 
to resume Big Ten play against 
No. 9 Minnesota on Friday and 
Saturday. Michigan (1-3-0 Big Ten, 
8-9-1 overall) is coming off a two-
week break after the Great Lakes 
Invitational on December 29 and 
30, where it finished third overall.

“You’d like to say that you keep 

the same mentality whether you’re 
playing on a weekend or not, but 
it’s just a different feel around the 
rink,” said senior goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort. “I feel like we haven’t 
been playing consistent hockey 
games in months because we’ve 
been off for a couple weeks, so I’m 
excited to play this weekend. … I’m 
hungry to play hockey.”

The Golden Gophers (3-1-0, 

11-5-2) are currently riding a four-
game win streak and won five of 
six in the month of December. 
Captain 
and 
forward 
Justin 

Kloos has been imperative to the 
program’s recent success, tallying 
nine points in Minnesota’s past 
four games with three goals and 
six assists.

Kloos also boasts a record of 129 

career points in 135 games, ranking 
him third in the NCAA and first in 
the Big Ten among active players. 

But it is forward Tyler Sheehy who 
leads Minnesota in points and 
goals so far this season with 25 and 
12, respectively.

“They score a lot of goals at 

home, they’ve got the home crowd 
just like everyone does,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“If we can keep them off the 
scoresheet, that means they’re not 
having a good game and we are. So 
that’s the bottom line. We’ve got 
to shut their best forwards down, 
they’ve got guys with 12 goals and 
so on, so it’s going to be a good 
challenge for us.”

Michigan isn’t without a strong 

roster, either. Junior forward Tony 
Calderone leads the Wolverines 
in goals with 10, while freshman 
forward Will Lockwood leads in 
points with 13. And sophomore 
defenseman Joe Cecconi has just 

returned to Michigan’s lineup 
after winning a gold medal at the 
World 
Junior 
Championships 

with the U.S. team.

However, the Golden Gophers 

do 
have 
one 

interesting 
challenge 
for 

the 
Wolverines: 

Minnesota’s rink 
is Olympic-sized. 
To prepare for 
the 
different 

atmosphere, 
Michigan 
has 

been 
practicing 

at The Cube, an 
Olympic-sized ice 
rink in Ann Arbor.

“Practicing here (at the Cube) 

is big for us,” said Nagelvoort. 
“The only thing I really notice is 
the angles are a little different on 

the power play because the ice is 
wider. They have more room to 
play with the puck on the sides, so 
you have to change your angles a 
little bit. But I feel confident after 

skating here the 
last 
couple 
of 

days. 
We’ve 

worked on those 
kinds of things.”

That work will 

come into play 
this weekend, and 
while this series 
isn’t determining 
a 
tournament 

title, it does decide 
which team will 

tack on additional conference 
wins. With much of Big Ten play 
coming in the next few months, 
both teams could use a step in the 
right direction.

FOOTBALL
Michigan officially 
hires Pep Hamilton

The 
time 
for 
speculation 

has ended. Pep Hamilton has 
officially been hired as the 
Michigan football team’s assistant 
head coach and passing game 
coordinator.

“Pep Hamilton is a proven, 

outstanding 
football 
coach, 

husband 
and 
father” 
said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
in 
a 
released 
statement 
on 

MGoBlue.com. “His teaching and 
mentoring skills have produced 
quality athletes and quality young 
men, including some of the finest 
quarterbacks and wide receivers 
in the country. We are thrilled and 
excited to have Pep and Nicole and 
their children — April, Jackson 
and Elizabeth — as members of 
our Michigan family.”

Hamilton 
is 
joining 
the 

Wolverines’ coaching staff after 
spending the 2016 season as the 
Cleveland Browns’ assistant head 
coach and quarterbacks coach.

His move to Ann Arbor has felt 

probable for roughly a week, but 
the report only became offical 
Thursday.

This 
isn’t 
the 
first 
time 

Hamilton 
has 
coached 
with 

Harbaugh — he was a part of 
Harbaugh’s staff at Stanford in 
2010, where he served as the wide 
receivers coach. 

Hamilton’s arrival helps to 

fill the staff vacancy created by 
Jedd Fisch’s departure from the 
program, as he recently accepted 
a position as the new offensive 
coordinator for UCLA.

It appears Hamilton could 

be a perfect fit to replace Fisch, 
who 
served 
as 
Michigan’s 

quarterbacks 
coach, 
wide 

receivers 
coach 
and 
passing 

game coordinator. Hamilton has 
significant experience coaching 
both positions, as he has served 
as an offensive coordinator at 
numerous stops throughout his 

career. Like Fisch, Hamilton 
brings 
a 
unique 
blend 
of 

experience at both the collegiate 
and professional level.

Hamilton began his career 

at Howard University, where 
he served as the quarterbacks 
coach and later as the offensive 
coordinator before moving on to 
the professional level — coaching 
with the New York Jets, San 
Francisco 49ers and Chicago 
Bears. He returned to college 
football in 2010 to join Harbaugh’s 
staff at Stanford.

Under 
Hamilton, 
Cardinal 

receivers 
combined 
for 
129 

catches for 2,026 yards and were 
part of an offense that scored 40.3 
points per game that year, making 
Stanford the ninth-ranked offense 
in the nation.

After Harbaugh’s departure 

from 
the 
program 
following 

the 2010 season, Hamilton took 
over as the Cardinals’ offensive 
coordinator for the next two years. 
With him at the helm, Stanford’s 
offense averaged 43.2 and 27.9 
points per game, respectively, in 
2011 and 2012, before he left for 
the NFL once again.

Before his stint with the 

Browns, 
Hamilton 
was 
the 

offensive coordinator for the 
Indianapolis Colts, calling plays 
for 
former 
Stanford 
players 

Andrew Luck and Coby Fleener. 
He joined the Browns after being 
fired by the Colts in 2015.

But now, he has landed with 

Michigan for the next step in his 
coaching career. 

“It is an honor and privilege 

to be part of one of the most 
storied 
programs 
in 
college 

football history,” Hamilton said 
in a released statement. “I look 
forward to working with Coach 
Harbaugh and members of the 
staff at Michigan. I am excited to 
get to work meeting our players 
so that I can assist with their 
development on the field and in 
the university community.”

From past to present, mindfulness helps Wilton Speight bounce back

For 
a 
first-time 
starting 

quarterback, 
Wilton 
Speight 

is 
noticeably 
measured 
on 

the 
football 
field. 
Whether 

completing a touchdown pass 
or an interception, the redshirt 
sophomore often reacts in a 
similar way. If he throws a pick, 
he’ll usually jog to the sidelines 
with his head down, but he 
won’t throw a temper tantrum. 
If he throws a touchdown, he’ll 
usually greet his receiver in the 
end zone, but he won’t celebrate 
much more than that. The most 
you’ll see is an emphatic fist 
pump.

When asked if he has a 

chill personality though, he 
responded in a way that might 
surprise many.

“It’s funny, because no, not at 

all.”

Despite his calm demeanor on 

the field, Speight admitted that 
his competitive spirit gets the 
best of him in other aspects of his 
life. He says his temper can flare 
when playing a game of table 
tennis, where he’s been known 
to break the ping pong paddle. 
When he was younger, he would 
sulk and even refuse to talk to his 
mom if she beat him in a game of 
“HORSE” in the 
backyard.

Though that 

competitive 
drive 
is 
still 

in him, he has 
a 
better 
way 

of 
controlling 

that 
intensity 

now. While he 
may 
release 

that 
energy 

when losing a 
no-stakes game of table tennis, 
Speight learned long ago how to 
avoid doing the same during a 
football game.

***

The 22-year-old first learned 

how to remain grounded during 
his freshman year of high school 
at Richmond (Va.) Collegiate, 
when he started working with 
his varsity basketball coach Alex 
Peavey — who also doubles as a 
mindfulness teacher.

Though Speight was a three-

sport varsity athlete at Collegiate 
— he also played basketball and 
lacrosse — it became clear early 
on that Speight’s greatest talent 
lied in football. In order to work 
on what was holding him back, 
Speight went to Peavey to learn 
more about how mindfulness 
could 
translate 
to 
football. 

To this day, Speight still texts 
Peavey every week.

Speight 
slowly 
started 
to 

implement 
the 
technique 
he 

learned after realizing the effect it 
could have on himself and his team.

“(Speight) has always been as 

competitive as anybody on the 
court, on the field, at the bowling 
alley,” Peavey said in December. 
“Wherever you are, he’s going to 
be the most competitive person 
in that setting. Where I’ve seen 
growth is how he funnels that 
competitive energy to maximize 
his peak performance. Some 
of us get so competitive, it’s 
to our own demise, where the 
competition 
undermines 
our 

own performance.”

As Speight grew up, he fit the 

mold of many young athletes, 

allowing his competitiveness to 
be a detriment. The frustration 
from a bad game would affect 
his performance, but because 
he was so much more talented 
than many of his high school 
teammates, it never changed 
the outcome of the game. Still, 
Speight 
knew 
that 
making 

himself miserable would catch 
up to him if he didn’t learn how 
to control it, and the Michigan 
quarterback has come a long way.

“I remember in middle school 

basketball camp, having to calm 
him down in situations and 
again, it’s literally like a week-
long middle school basketball 
camp, but he’s treating it like 
it’s Game 7 of the NBA Finals,” 
Peavey said. “Which is a good 
thing, but again, it’s how you 
funnel your energy so it’s not to 
your detriment.”

From Peavey’s perspective, if 

an athlete practices mindfulness, 
there’s a better chance of being 
able to play from a set of skills 
instead of a set of emotions. It’s 
a process that helps Speight stay 
centered after game-changing 
plays, 
and 
it’s 
an 
essential 

component of his success with 
the Wolverines.

***
If you see Speight clicking 

and unclicking his helmet strap 

between 
plays, 

there 
might 
be 

more to it than you 
would think.

Peavey 
was 

introduced 
to 

mindfulness 
as 

a form of stress 
management 
through Dr. Jon 
Kabat-Zinn, who 
taught a training 
course in stress 

reduction at the Center for 
Mindfulness at the University 
of 
Massachusetts 
Medical 

School. According to Peavey, 
Kabat-Zinn encourages people 

to find things they do in their 
everyday life that they can bring 
mindfulness to, like washing 
dishes or brushing their teeth. 
Peavey teaches mindfulness to 
all of the freshmen at Richmond 
Collegiate, but he also teaches 
his athletes how to utilize 
mindfulness in order to play at 
the highest level.

Mindfulness is used in many 

professions, Peavey said — even 
the medical field. Kabat-Zinn 
trained 
doctors 
to 
practice 

mindfulness 
before 
their 

performance, which can be a 
high-stakes situation in which 
the performance is surgery itself. 
Doctors already have to scrub 
in prior to surgery, so focusing 
on the act of scrubbing in and 
staying in the present moment 
acts as a tool for some doctors to 
release stress before performing.

It may not be surgery, but 

Speight’s responsibilities on the 
gridiron carry their own kind of 
stress.

Though Peavey doesn’t force 

any of his students to utilize 
mindfulness in sports, Speight 
always 
seemed 
particularly 

interested in it. When Speight 
was in high school, Peavey asked 
him what he did that was similar 
to a doctor scrubbing in, and 
he said that he has to click his 
helmet’s chinstrap.

“I 
practiced 
a 
ton 
with 

(Peavey), 
almost 
like 
a 

meditation-type thing,” Speight 
said in November. “We figured 
out whenever I click my buckle 
in my helmet or 
lick 
my 
fingers 

before a snap, that 
kind of brings me 
back to this chill 
mode. In football, 
I feel like I’ve kind 
of mastered it, but 
I’m still working 
on the other stuff.”

Added Peavey: 

“What he’s doing 
when he unsnaps 
and resnaps his helmet is he’s 
tapped in fully to the sensory 
experience of that two-second 
activity. And you’re getting the 
mind not to ignore everything 

that just happened, but to see 
it, to feel it, to experience it, to 
let it go and refocus yourself on 

something that’s here in this 
present moment.”

All of Peavey’s students have 

different 
ways 

of 
refocusing. 

For some, it’s 
squirting 
a 

green Gatorade 
water 
bottle, 

and for others, 
it’s 
wiping 

off 
their 
face 

with a towel. 
The 
common 

thread is that it 
stops a person’s 

internal alarm from going off.

One of the first athletes that 

Peavey coached at Collegiate was 
Seattle Seahawks quarterback 
Russell Wilson. Wilson was 
Peavey’s 
point 
guard 
for 

three years, and at the time, 
Peavey wasn’t yet calling it 
mindfulness. But he taught his 
players different ways to funnel 
their competitive drive into a 
purposeful place rather than 
toward anger or excitement from 
the previous play.

“(Wilson) uses the sense of 

sight,” 
Peavey 
said. 
“Where 

Wilton unsnaps and resnaps 
his chin strap, Russell picks 
something out in the stadium 
and he just kind of looks at it.”

As Peavey explains it, if you 

practice your technique every 
time you make a mistake, you’ll 
get stronger. From a neurological 
standpoint, neurons are fired 
that predispose you to make it 
easier to stay mindful each time 
you practice. If it becomes a 
routine, it should work during 
the game.

Rather 
than 
lament 
the 

mistake that was made, that 
error becomes an opportunity to 
get better.

***
After 
seeing 
his 
former 

student throw an interception on 

his very first play of 2016, Peavey 
couldn’t wait to see what Speight 
would do. He desperately wanted 
the camera to pan to the sidelines 
so he could watch Speight’s 
reaction to the pick.

Throughout 
the 
season, 

Speight faced multiple situations 
where he had to bounce back, and 
it all began with the interception 
that started his career as a 
Michigan quarterback. In stark 
contrast to his first play, he 
ended the game 10-for-13 for 
three touchdowns. He played 
the next three games without 
throwing a pick.

Speight faced more adversity 

against Wisconsin and Michigan 
State, but he cruised throughout 
the middle half of the season 
with relative ease. His next 
biggest 
challenge 
came 
at 

Iowa, where he had his worst 
performance 
of 
the 
season. 

In the electric atmosphere of 
Kinnick Stadium, he not only 
threw for just 103 yards but also 
injured his shoulder late in the 
fourth quarter. He was sidelined 
for Michigan’s next game against 
Indiana.

When Speight 

did 
return, 
he 

had 
to 
battle 

both his injury 
and the weight 
of the Iowa loss. 
Making it all the 
more 
difficult 

was 
that 
his 

return would be 
“The Game” at 
the 
Horseshoe 

against 
the 
second-ranked 

Buckeyes. 
He 
sputtered 
at 

times — throwing a pick-six and 
fumbling on Ohio State’s one-
yard line — but the Wolverines 
scored touchdowns immediately 
after both turnovers. Though 
it wasn’t pretty, and Michigan 
ended 
up 
losing 
in 
double 

overtime, 
Speight 
finished 

23-for-36 for two touchdowns.

Speight 
then 
headed 
to 

the Orange Bowl to play the 
Seminoles, and following a poor 
first half where the Wolverines 
posted just 83 yards of total 
offense, he rallied to lead two 
touchdown drives in the fourth 
quarter and give his team the 
lead.

“I couldn’t sit in here in 

halftime and be all stressed and 
mad about what happened in 
the first half,” Speight said in 
the locker room after the game. 
“That does no good for anybody. 
In the moment of halftime and in 
the moment of the plays we were 
going to run going out into the 
second half, I completely forgot 
about the first half, and that’s 
what I did all year.”

But Florida State took the 

lead back with 36 seconds to go, 
and on the next drive, Speight’s 
season ended where it began — 
with an interception.

Now, heading into 2017, he’ll 

have to bounce back again — not 
just from that final play, but from 

a 
10-3 
season 

that 
caused 

disappointment 
among 
fans 

and 
players 

who expected a 
College Football 
Playoff 
berth 

out 
of 
the 

Wolverines. 
Next season will 
present 
new 

challenges 
that 

the quarterback hasn’t yet seen, 
including taking on a larger 
leadership role as a second-year 
starting quarterback (assuming 
he retains his job). And when 
that time comes, he might need 
to lean on his high school coach’s 
teachings more than ever.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight often doesn’t react too strongly after either positive or negative plays in order to maintain an calm attitude.

That kind of 

brings me back 

to this chill 

mode

He’s going to 
be the most 
competitive 
person there

I couldn’t sit in 
here and be all 
stressed and 

mad
