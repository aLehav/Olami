President to hold
office hours for
students at start of
new semester
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
University President Mark
Schlissel joined 30 students in the
Michigan Union on Thursday for
his fourth and final fireside chat
of the semester.

Covering topics including ath-
letics culture, mental health and
public safety, Schlissel opened by
noting his first semester as presi-
dent is drawing to a close.
He said the fireside chats -
during which a few dozen ran-
domly selected students are
given the chance to participate in
a conversation with their presi-
dent - provided a great forum for
getting to know the University's
student body. However, Schlissel
said he plans to add office hours
in January and begin teaching as
a guest lecturer to further devel-

op these connections.
"All of this is really an effort
for me to get to know and under-
stand you and your fellow stu-
dents, upholding the values here
and how we're doing delivering
that and how I can do my job as
well as possible," he said.
In one of the first questions,
LSA senior Wes Vear, captain of
the men's club rowing team, said
the team's coach is one of just a
few openly gay staff members in
college athletics. He noted that
particularly in men's football,
coaching staff and leadership

positions are predominantly held
by white males,
Vear asked if Schlissel had
any plans to work with interim
Athletic Director Jim Hackett to
increase diversity in the ranks of
the University's athletics staff.
Last week, Hackett hosted a
press conference announcing
that he had decided to fire for-
mer Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke. The firing followed
a tumultuous season. for Michi-

After Morris
controversy, lecture
addresses common
misconceptions
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
When sophomore quarterback
Shane- Morris was pulled out of
the Wolverines' Sept. 27 game
against Minnesota, media atten-
tion was immediately drawn to
his "probable, mild" concussion
and the people responsible for the
care of players on the sidelines.
Monday evening, Associate
Neurology Prof. Jeffrey Kutcher
delivered a presentation refuting
commonly held misconceptions
about concussions and head inju-
ries that he feelshave been widely
circulated by the media in recent
years. The presentation, titled
"Myths and Realities of Youth
Sport Head Injuries," was held
in the Hatcher Library before an
audience of about 30 students,

faculty and members of the gen-
eral public.
Public outcry regarding con-
cussion policies in college ath-
letics has swelled in recent years
following reports of suspected
long-term physical dangers and
mental detriments caused by
concussions. However, scientific
research and media reports have
often told two different stories in
this debate.
Over the course of the hour-
long presentation, Kutcher
touched on many of the greatest
fallacieshe has observed in media
discussions regarding concus-
sions sustained by both collegiate
and professional athletes.
Kutcher drew on his personal
experiences working as a team
physician for the Michigan foot-
ball team, as well as director of
the Michigan NeuroSport Pro-
gram, a laboratory unit located in
the Central Campus Recreation
Building that specializes in con-
cussion research and treatment.
Earlier this year, Kutcher served
as the head neurologist for Team

'Therapaws'
dogs return
to provide
exam relief
Students gather at
UGLi to de-stress
during finals week
By PARISHA NOVA
Daily StaffReporter
A number of dogs were on
hand at the Shapiro Under-
graduate Library on Monday
to provide some extra love to
students stressed by impending
final exams.
The dogs were provided by
Therapaws of Michigan, an Ann
Arbor-based organization that
brings teams of dogs and their
owners to visit schools, health
care facilities and libraries.
The organization first started
by bringing dogs to see patients
at the University of Michigan
Health System.
"Therapaws hosts therapy
dogs, not service dogs," said Jan
Collins, a Therapaws volunteer
who brought her dog Cooper
to the event. "This means that
they love to be pet and love to
give love back."
Therapaws dogs, along with
their owners, must pass exten-
sive tests administered through
the national organization Ther-
apy Dogs Inc. to qualify for the
volunteer opportunity. They
then complete trial runs at local
nursing homes, where their
reactions to strangers are eval-
uated for their ease in interact-
ing with new people.

University group
invites young
faculty members
to develop research
By TANYA MADHANI
Daily Staff Reporter
The U-M African Presiden-
tial Scholars Program held its
Research Symposium for the
fall semester in the Rackham
Assembly Hall Monday. The pro-
gram was established in 2008
following former University'
President Mary Sue Coleman's
visit to Ghana.
Each semester, UMAPS
invites selected early-career fac-
ulty members from institutions
in Ghana, Liberia, South Africa
and Uganda to the University to
conduct post-doctoral research
for up to six months. During

their visits, scholars study top-
ics ranging from breast cancer
detection to literary depictions
of poverty, all under the mentor-
ship of University faculty mem-
bers.
The scholars are placed in
the African Studies Center and
various departments depending
on their discipline and research
topic.
"We started this research
symposium as a way for the
University community to learn
more about the research that
was being done by these excel-
lent scholars," said Devon Keen,
program manager at the African
Studies Center.
She said the program aims to
foster a better understanding of
global issues through the Afri-
can perspective.
"There's someone from the
Law School who did tax law and
we had a visiting faculty person
whoworked on international tax

from the South African perspec-
tive," Keen said. "And asa result
of their collaboration, in his next
publication the University facul-
ty member included a chapter in
his publication about South Afri-
can tax law. He had been writing
about international tax law for
a while but never thought of it
from an African perspective."
Keen said the collaboration
between the University and var-
ious African universities fosters
cultural exchange.
"In this way the program
benefits the visiting faculty and
benefits our faculty and students
who get a chance to learn from,
meet, and expand their net-
works in research agendas," she
said. "It's a big way to interna-
tionalize the University. One of
the big goals of the University is
internationalization."

GOINeG GLOeBoAs
Prof. finds passion in Peace Corps

Mike McGovern is aprofessor of
political anthropology at the Uni-
versity, with afocus on West Afri-
ca. Before coming to the University
in 2011, McGovern taught anthro-
pology at Yale University for six
years. For the past 25 years he has
been living back and forth between
the United States and Guinea. He
has also served as the West Africa
project director of the Internation-
al Crisis Group, a Brussels-based
organization that specializes in
analyzing the causes of armed
conflict. He received a Ph.D. from
Emory University in 2004.
How did youbecome interested
in your fieldof study?
I was a Peace Corps volunteer

in Guinea between 1989 and 1991.
I was a math teacher there, and
I really didn't know anything
about the place when I went. It's
a francophone country in West
Africa, and I spoke some French
and had done calculus in col-
lege. I grew to love the country
and ended up going back sev-
eral years later to do my Ph.D.
research.
What project are you
currentlyworkingon?
I'm currently working on a
book called "A Socialist Peace."
It's about why wars don't break
out in some places. Because the
Ebola epidemic began about 20
miles from where I have lived

on and off for the past 25 years,
I've been doing a lot of stuff on
Ebola for the past four months.
I'm putting what I already know
from years of research on the
history and the culture of that
area.
What project are you most
proud of?
I really very much enjoyed
doing my last book, which is
called "Unmasking the State."
It's about an attempt to eradicate
masks and other kinds of wooden
figurines from a part of Guinea
where I work and what that was
all about.

U.S. has reduced carbon emissions,

University planetarium aims *

but pollution still rising globally to bring stars in full focus

Gasoline and diesel
exports contribute
to overall global
warming trend
GARDI SUGDUP, Panama
(AP) - Heat-trapping pollution
released into the atmosphere
from rising exports of U.S. gaso-
line and diesel dwarfs the cuts
made from fuel efficiency stan-
dards and other efforts to reduce
global warming in the United
States, according to a new Asso-
ciated Press investigation.
Under President Barack
Obama, the U.S. has reduced
more carbon pollution from
energy than any other nation,
about 475 million tons between
2008 and 2013, according to U.S.
Energy Department data. Less
than one-fifth of that amount
came from burning less gasoline
and diesel fuel.

fuel than ever to other parts
of the world, where efforts to
address resulting "pollution are
just gettingunderway, if advanc-
ing at all. U.S. exports of gaso-
line and diesel released roughly
1 billion tons of carbon pollution
into the atmosphere elsewhere
during the same period, accord-
ing to AP's analysis.
This fossil fuel trade has
helped President Barack Obama
meet political goals to curb car-
bon dioxide at home, by taking it
off America's pollution balance
sheet. But that does not neces-
sarily help the planet.
Despite efforts by the U.S.
and others, pollution linked to
global warming is still rising
worldwide.
In Panama, imports of diesel
and gasoline from the U.S. have
nearly quadrupled since 2008.
Panama is the largest recipi-
ent of diesel fuel dirtier and
more carbon-laden than would
be allowed in the U.S., in part

Yet the U.S. is sending more because the fuel is used in cars
H,-,,

and trucks that do not have the
same efficiency standards and,
are not regularly inspected and
maintained, the AP's investiga-
tion found.
Panama's requirement that
drivers test emissions, including
for carbon dioxide, are almost
completely ignored.
"It's a false image," said Onel
Masardule of the Indigenous
People's Biocultural Climate
Change Assessment Initiative,
a Peru-based environmental
group. "In reality, the U.S is still
contaminating."
Obama has overseen a domes-
tic boom in oil and natural gas
production and ordered the big-
gest increases in fuel economy
in history.
That's helped the U.S. reduce
oil imports, create jobs, boost
exports and shrink the trade
deficit.
But for global warming, fuel
exports mean that, at the very
least, the administration is
making a smaller dent than it
claims.
"This is their hidden success
story that they would like to
keep hidden," said Kevin Book,
a Washington-based energy
analyst and a member of the
National Petroleum Council, a
federal advisory group in the
U.S.
"It has done a lot to improve
our balance of trade standing,
but it is not the most climate-
friendly way to do it. There is no
way to avoid that there is a big-
ger emissions impact when you
have more to combust," Book
said.
There is no clear accounting
of what America's growthdas a
fossil-fuel powerhouse is doing
to the global-warming picture.
U.S. projects that increase ener-
gy exports could be considered,
such as huge terminals planned
for the West Coast to send more
coal abroad for power plants.
Trade agreements could factor
in the implications of energy
trade on global warming. But
no trade pactsnegotiated by the
White House mention it.

Natural History
museum offers talks
every Saturday,
Sunday all year
ByKRISTENANDERSON
For theDaily
Every weekend, dozens of
people head inside to observe
the night sky. Q
The University of Michigan
Museum of Natural History
offers the program "Star Talk:
The Sky Tonight" year-round
on Saturdays and Sundays.
Small groups attend each pro-
gram, which runs about 45
minutes long and takes place
in the museum's 36-seat plan-
etarium.
Though each presenter's
content is different, audience
members can expect to see
constellations visible from
Earth, view other planets in
our solar system and leave the
Milky Way to observe celes-
tial bodies far outside our gal-
axy, even those on the edge of
the universe. The planetarium
enables simulated observation
of the night sky based on actual
astronomical data, without the
impacts of light pollution or
adverse weather conditions.
Audience members usu-
ally include the general public,
K-12 students on field trips,

as well as University students
who may find themselves in
the planetarium as part of an
astronomy course.
Planetarium manager Matt
Linke said many people come
to a star talk during the sum-
mer to become familiarized
with constellations and to be
able to identify them on camp-
ing trips.
"We focus on those objects,
those patterns, that are most
dominant over the season,"
Linke said. "What we decide to
do with content really is based
on what do we think people
want to see when they go out-
side."
Each star talk is delivered
unscripted, and each presenter
interacts with the audience in
a different way. All presenters
are University students, most
of whom study astronomy,
physics or a closely related sci-
ence. .
"There is no one star talk,"
Linke said. "I give them the
opportunity to design the star
talk the way it makes sense for
them to present it. If you go to
three different shows, you'll
get three different star talks."
For example, LSA senior
Alyssa Keimach, one of the
planetarium's operators,
included close-up observation
of the International Space Sta-
tion and the Mars rover in her
presentation, as well as further
observation of several galaxy

clusters. She outlined the cri-
teria for classifying planets
and discussed the discovery of
cosmic background radiation,
mentioning that the Milky Way
will collide with the Androme-
da Galaxy in four billion years.
"I believe in probability,"
Keimach said. There is prob-
ably some other form of life
out there. It doesn't have to be
intelligent."
Keimach also explained to
audience members that light
from distant stars can take
billions of light years to reach
Earth. Certain stars in distant
galaxies could have implod-
ed millions of years ago and
ceased to exist, but scientists
may never know.
"When we view deep space
stuff, we're also actually look-
ing back in time," she said.
During her star talks, Kei-
mach sometimes encourages
audience members to sign up
for a NASA program that alerts
participants whenever the
International Space Station is
observable from their city.
Star talks are offered Satur-
days at 11:30 a.m.,1:30 p.m. and
3:30 p.m., and Sundays at 1:30
p.m. and 3:30 p.m. Additional
seasonal programs include
"Season of Light" and "Extra-
solar Planets - Discovering
New Worlds."
Admission to the museum
is free, and planetarium pro-
grams charge $5 per person.

Though Schlissel said hiring a
new head coach is ultimately up
to Hackett, he thanked students
for encouraging more female rep-

improve gender diversity within
the program.
"I think that's a great question
for me to ask and how we think of
issues of gender and other issues

"In the long run, I want
it to just build on existing

said. "The time that we've
been given here to build on
this existing knowledge is so
important. In terms of the
long-term impact, I guess it
will be a collection of what
(I'll) do to promote research in
Africa, about research in our
countries."
DeWet worked at the Popu-

cerns and a disconnect between
students on North Campus and
Central Campus.
LSA senior Alex Abdun-Nabi
spoke about Ann Arbor's cur-
rent moratorium on erecting
new streetlights on campus due
to cost concerns. He said this
poses problems for off-campus
students living in areas such as
Kerrytown and South Campus.
Schlissel said with the recent
election of Ann Arbor Mayor
Christopher Taylor, the Ann
Arbor City Council has looked
into lifting the moratorium and
increasing lighting throughout
the city.
Schlissel also commented on
the amicable relationship he
shares with Taylor, noting that
both are open to meeting regu-

larly to address the concerns of
student residents.
Students also raised issues
related to the seemingly separate
nature of North Campus.
One student with dual enroll-
ment in the Ross School of Busi-
ness and the School of Art &
Design noted the distinct cul-
tures that exist in each school
due to their geographical sepa-
ration. Others said North Cam-
pus tends to get overlooked in
discussions of overall University
improvement, raising concerns
associated with the Bursley Din-
ing Hall and the deteriorating
infrastructure of the Northwood
Apartments.
Schlissel said the discussion
to improve North Campus is a
relatively new one and students

might not see changes in the
near future. However, he said
improvements are in the works.
"It'll take a couple of years,
but the discussion to improve
the campus is happening now,"
he said.
Schlissel asked students for
suggestions to help bridge the
gap between schools and colleg-
es on North Campus and Central
Campus. One student suggested
creating interdisciplinary pro-
grams to facilitate collabora-
tions between students in both
schools.
Another topic of discussion
was the improvement of men-
tal health services on campus.
Because of the stressful nature of
final exam period, more students
seek psychological help and

therapy during the final weeks of
school than duringthe rest of the
semester-
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, who also
participated'in the montly chat,
said the additional number of
students attempting to seek
treatment often results in lon-
ger wait times at Counseling and
Psychological Services.
Both Harper and Schlissel
noted that in the past the Univer-
sity has attempted to hire addi-
tional staff during these periods,
yet has underestimated the num-
ber of students seeking help this
season.
Both said the University is
currently considering increasing
the total number of counselors
and expanding CAPS as a whole.

Policing the police
Body cameras are a good first step towards improving law enforcement
The recent decisions to not indict police officers involved
in the deaths of Black men such as Michael Brown and
Eric Garner have inspired passionate conversations about
our justice system. Across the nation, several police departments
are seeking to rebuild trust in their respective communities by
implementing policies to increase transparency. On Dec. 2, the
Ypsilanti City Council approved a resolution for the purchase of 15
body cameras for its police staff after nearly a year of discussions.
While the Garner case has proven body cameras alone can't be
expected to solve deeply rooted and systemic issues of police
brutality, requiring officers to wear them has been statistically
shown to create more accountability on all sides. Therefore, the
Ann Arbor Police Department, the University of Michigan Police
Department and other law enforcement agencies across the
nation should adopt the use of body cameras as the first step in a
multi-pronged approach to police reformation.

Intheproblem-posingmethod,"The
teacher is no longer merely the-one-
who-teaches, but one who is himself
taught in dialogue with the students,
who in turn while being taught also
teach. They become jointly responsible
for a process in which all grow."
This philosophy considers
the student a human entity with
intellectual value, able to contribute

to his or her own journey of
education. Simply put, dialogue is
stimulating. Lectures are not.
As I come to a close on my four
years as an undergrad, I reflect on the
classes I've taken - those that have
inspired and those that have fallen
short. Unfortunately for me, the ratio
seems a bit off. Some of that has to
do with distribution requirements

forcing me to take courses I'm not
interested in. Much ofithas to do with
my professors' seeming disinterest in
taking a true role in the dialectical
relationship of education. Spare me
your lectures and textbooks and
multiple-choice exams. Provide me
with the tools and freedom to think.
Marls Harmon is an LSA senior.


The Ross School of Business
is located on Tappan
Avenue, in a building so
large, orange
and modern that
it almost looks
as though it was
intentionally
designed to
differentiate
itself from the
rest of campus.
The inside - filled VICTORIA
with hanging NOBLE
artwork, glass
windows that
flood the space
with natural light and small study
rooms each equipped with audio-
visual equipment - looks nothing
like Lorch Hall down the street,
or Mason Hall a few blocks away.
When I visited the University as
a prospective student, this was
intenselyobviousto me.
Last winter semester, I was one of
a handful of people in my Econom-
ics 101 class who had no intention
of applying to the Business School.
One day in discussion section, as my
class and I waited for class to begin,
I listened as students detailed their
concerns that, if they didn't get into
Ross, they wouldn't have anything
else to study atthe University. Trying
to be helpful, I offered economics,
statistics and communications stud-
ies as possible alternatives. "No," one
student told me. They had no inten-
tion of staying in LSA. If they didn't
get into Ross, they would be applying
to the Ford School of Public Policy,
another exclusive "special program."
Happy to have found someone
who I thought might've shared my
interested in politics, I excitedly
asked what kind of policy they were
interested in. Oops, I had again mis-
read my classmate. As it turned out,
they weren't really interested in
policy at all.
Andthatkindof made me wonder
- out of the probably hundreds of
people in my class who were applying
to the Business School, how many
were interested in business? Not
business as a.high-powered career
andaperceived pathtoahighstarting
salary. Not business as a major that
might provide added benefits like
an intense recruiting process, a

?oss and the res
shiny, high-tech class building or a
closer community of students also
in their major. But rather, how many
of these students were interested in
the major for the skills and lessons
it might provide? How many of
them even knew, beyond what they
had been told in mass meetings and
read onthe Ross website, what those
skills were?
There's no doubt that the Business
School, ranked fourth in the country
in 2014, is an excellent program.
Likewise, there's no doubt that
Business School graduates are highly
desired by employers - 92 percent
of 2014 graduates were offered a
job by graduation. But, if a student
finds themselfinthe programforthe
wrong reasons, the overall strength
of the program won't make up for
the missed opportunity to study'
something about which they were
truly passionate.
So to freshmen considering apply-,
ing to Ross, do your best to ensure
that you're doing so for the right rea-
sons. You'll do the best at the thing
you're most passionate about. The
ability to demonstrate that passion
and commitment - not to mention
show off the higher grades that often
follow trueengagement with course-
work - will likely get you a whole
lot further in the job market than
a BBA degree and Ross-sponsored
networking opportunities. Ircan per-
sonallytell you that I've found a lot of
incredible internships and opportu-
nities as an LSA student. If you don't
know what you're passionate about-
this is the time to find out - but
don't settle for a major just because
it's highly ranked, likely to get you a
job or housed in a pumpkin-colored
architectural masterpiece.
While it's important that students
do some serious introspection
before choosing a major, it would be
unwise to ignore the many ways in
which University action has nudged
students toward programs that
they may not truly be academically
iriterested'in.
The Business School also offersso
many resources to its students that
students from other majors usually
don't have access to. For example,
Ross-affiliated student organiza-
tions can get access to special fund-
ing, and can use Ross facilities for

meetings and events. Meanwhile,
non-affiliated groups have to pay
to use University facilities. The
Business School also holds a pro-
fessional recruiting process that
is generally restricted to Ross stu-
dents - though other students can
pay a fee to participate. Many Ross
students also participate in student
organizations explicitly restricted
to or mostly filled with other Ross
students, providing an added sense
of community. Due to the exclu-
sivity of the school, it's completely
understandable that many students
might apply to the Business School,
even if they're unsure whether the
program is right for them.
In some cases, similar resources
are availableto general LSA students.
It's certainly possible for them to get
career guidance and ad-hoc funding
for student organizations. However,
while smaller special programs can
offer a more centralized and struc-
tured approach to connect students
with resources, LSA students are
often on their own. For example,
while .professional planning and
recruitment is heavily emphasized
for Ross students, 36.8 percent of
unemployed recent LSA graduates
didn't begin their job search until
after graduation. The Career Center
can provide resources to help stu-
dents find a job, but they have to seek
that guidance out on their own.
The University has a responsibility
to ensure that the perceived (or
actual) inequality of experiences or
resources between LSA and special
programs like the Business School
is not contributing to students'
decisions to pursue any given major.
When students decide to attend the
University of Michigan, most do
so with the expectation that they
will receive a world-class education
in whatever they choose to study.
Once they arrive on campus, they
deserve the freedom to decide
what that subject is without-feeling
constrainedbyadisparityinavailable
opportunities. By strivingto provide
a uniform quality of experience
and opportunity to all students, the
University can surely make progress
toward that end.

Ypsilanti Police Chief Tony DeGiusti
submitted a request to the Ypsilanti City
Council for nearly $55,000 worth of equipment
purchases andupgrades. While Ypsilanti police
cars currently have dashboard cameras that
can record police interactions in front of the
vehicles, DeGiusti noted that the outdated
equipment has become a problem for the
department. In addition, a bargain offered by
law enforcement technology company L-3
Mobile-Vision, motivated the police force
to purchase the cameras. Similarly, Eastern
Michigan University has announced plans to
invest $17,000 in body camera equipment for
officers, and Ann Arbor officials discussed
the implementation of body cameras
Monday,Dece. ,
Body mcaeras would not only hold police
more accountable for their actions, but also the
civilians with whom they interact. The cameras
could also potentially help with conflicting
witness testimonies that so often result from
encounters with police officers. Furthermore,
a study of the use of body cameras by police in
Rialto, California, shows that the use of force by
police fell by 60 percent and citizen complaints
decreased by 88 percent after their distribution.
Though it is commendable that the Ypsilanti
Police Department and other law enforcement
agencies are taking these preventative
measures, the use of these body cameras must
be accompanied by legislative guidelines
to ensure that the cameras are an effective
measure. The department has mandated that
officers turn their cameras on upon coming
into contact with a citizen. While there are
both pros and cons to this policy, legislators
must create aspecific, uniform policy providing
strict guidelines regarding when cameras

should be on and how they should be utilized.
According to The Atlantic, there is very little
conclusive and consistent evidence, research
or testing regarding the use of body cameras.
With President Barack Obama asking for $263
million in federal funding for the purchase and
training of body camera use, it's imperative
that these devices' role in the justice systembe
closely monitored.
It's important to note that body cameras
will not completely solve the problems that
exist between citizens and law enforcement.
As Obama stated after the Ferguson decision,
"This is a problem that is national." The road
to a solution must include providing police
personnel with better and more extensive
training. Police departmentsacross the
nation should reevaluate their practices
and hold their officers to a higherstandard.
Nonviolent measures should always be
encouraged whenever possible and officers
should be better trained to handle civilians
of all identities,"including those with mental
disabilities and other cognitive impairments.
Being aware of differing cultural identities
will lead police officers to become more
sensitive to the different issues facing groups
within our diverse society. It's becoming
increasingly evident that there is a deep
and extremely problematic divide between
some police forces in the United States and
the communities they police. In helping to
close this divide, body cameras are a piece
of the puzzle, but only that. To attempt
to move toward remedying this divide,
improved legislation and training must be
put into place in order to aid police forces
in their understanding and policing of their
respective communities.

How can we achieve friendly diplomacy

MARIS HARMONI | I M
Are you satisfied with your undergraduate education?

As I am coming up on completing my four
years at the University this spring I am starting
to wonder- could I have done something to feel
more satisfied with my liberal arts education?
Why is it that an outcome of my choice to receive
a liberal arts education is that I can't quite
articulate what I've learned in my classes? Is ita
resultof my class choices or my major selection?
Or is my lack of satisfaction a product of a system
that doesn't really know quite how to teach?
PauloFreire, in "Pedagogyof the oppressed,"
categorizes teaching into two main methods
- the banking method and the problem-
posing method. In the banking approach,
"Narration (with the teacher as narrator) leads
the students to memorize mechanically the
narrated account. Worse yet, it turns them
into 'containers,' into 'receptacles' to be 'filled'
by the teachers. The more completely she fills
the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The
more meekly the receptacles permit themselves
to be filled, the better students they are."
From required statistics courses to history
classes where I was mandated to memorize lists
of terms and capitals, I often felt likea receptacle.
I frequently felt trapped within an uncreative
paradigm of memorize and regurgitate within
classrooms and especially with GSIs. I did not
feel this way about all of my classes at all, but
the majority of survey courses, history seminars
and obligatory requirements fell incredibly short
of worthwhile experiences. Each year we pay
thousands of dollars to attend each course - why
should onlyaselectfewupper-levelcourses really
challenge our intellect and force us to truly think?
"The banking approach to adult education, for
example, will never propose to students that they
critically consider reality. It will deal instead with
such vital questions as whether Roger gave green
grass to the goat, and insist upon the importance
oflearning that, on the contrary, Roger gave green
grass to the rabbit. The'humanism'ofthe banking

approach masks the effort to turn women and
men into automatons - the verynegation oftheir
ontological vocation to be more fully human."
There have been countless instances when
I felt I was learning something so inapplicable
to the real world that it almost wasn't worth
challenging my brain to perform the task at
hand. Hundreds of pages of reading a week
didn't help me critically think or analyze - it
made me into a robot that skimmed some pages
of academic garble every night.
In problem-posing education, Freire's
counter to the banking approach is, "people
develop their power to perceive critically the
way they exist in the world with which and in
which they find themselves; they come to see
the world not as a static reality, but as a reality
in process, in transformation. Although the
dialectical relations of women and men with
the world exist independently of how these
relations are perceived (or whether or not they
are perceived at all), it is also true that the form
of action they adoptis to alarge extent a function
of how they perceive themselves in the world.
Hence, the teacher-student. and the students-
teachers reflect simultaneously on themselves
and the world without dichotomizing this
reflection from action, and thus establish an
authentic form of thought and action."
Students need to learn how to think as
individuals, not as robotic cogs in the academic
machine. That's boring and uninspiring.
University education has so much potential to
create passion and inspire fascination in the
minds of students; all of my friends love learning.
However, most of my friends do not love school.
There is a very big contradiction here that we
need to fix. The problem is not that my friends
and I are lazy or under-stimulated by the world
around us. The problem is that we are at the
mercy of teachers who treat us like receptacles
into whom they dump their knowledge.

A few weeks ago, the famous
author and activist Alice Walker pre-
sented a lecture for hundreds of peo-
ple at Hill Auditorium. Her lecture,
which was incredibly moving and
thought-provoking, was filled with
many feminist/womanist, environ-
mentalist and anti-war sentiments.
The main theme of her lecture was
friendship, which Walker expand-
ed to address friendships amongst
nations or, as it's most commonly
understood, diplomacy.
Later in her lecture, Walker
asserted the need to unlearn what
we have been taught to hold as truth.
Many audience members cheered
in agreement with this idea. In my
opinion, Walker was suggesting that
our formal schooling has presented
us with a very biased and simplistic
view of how things are. While I agree
and believe it is necessary to revise
exactly what we learn in order to
include a greater diversity of experi-
ences and viewpoints, I feel an addi-
tional degree as to how we learn and
how we feel about learning should be
addressed in order to achieve Walk-
er's vision of friendly diplomacy.
Quite obviously, diplomacy
revolves around the need to under-
stand cultures and ways of life of
people from around the world. I feel
that, all too often, our society has a
superficial as well as blindly biased
idea of the way things are in other
parts of the world. This is harmful
because, without a deeper and more
complex understanding of other cul-
tures, our society has the potential to
make decisions that can cause unin-
tended harm to many people.
So, I ask the question: why, as a
society, have we come to be more
comfortable with static, fixed and
one-dimensional views of issues,

ideas and unfamiliar cultures?
My hypothesis is the way in which
children are (generally) educated
within the public school system.
By means of class exams, state-
mandated tests and AP/SAT/ACT
tests, one cannot argue that the pub-
lic school system has come to be pri-
marily concerned with exactly what
students know. These types of tests
and ways of advancing in the public
school system are sending the mes-
sage to childrenthattheir knowledge
and opinions can boil down to being
either right or wrong. This is a gross
misrepresentation of real life - the
very thing education should be pre-
paring students for. Additionally, I
feel that kids are being taught from
a very young age that learning is a
one-time deal. Once students take an
exam on a particular topic, they often
feel they have learned all there is to
know, or, even worse, all they need to
know on that topic. How many times
have you heard asked, or perhaps
even asked yourself, "Will we need to
know that for the exam?"
Test's and exams have trained us
not to be comfortable unless we have
straightforward and immediate
solutions to a problem or question.
To tie this back to Walker's idea of
friendly diplomacy, our discomfort
with complexity becomes
problematic on a larger scale when
society tries to put major ideas and
decisions into tiny boxes labeled
"A, B, C and D." (When in doubt,
always guess C.) Society should
be comfortable with complex and
nuanced understandings of issues.
Additionally, we need to teach
kids from a young age that they will
never completely understand every-
thing and, as a result, they should
have a commitment to continual

learning. It is my belief that exams
do not foster this attitude toward
learning - it merely fosters an atti-
tude centered around passing tests
that are often devoid of any level
of complexity.
In addition to a commitment
to continual learning, I feel that
kids should be taught that they can
and should learn from anyone and
everyone. All too often our society
has underlying assumptions as to
who can learn from whom: teacher-
student, parent-child, developed
nation-developing nation, etc.
We need a generation of young
people who are humble enough
to break this mold of learning. In
my opinion, humility is a crucial
component to Walker's vision of
friendly diplomacy.
In conclusion, we need to restruc-
ture our public education system to
provide students a space in which
they can be comfortable with not
knowing the correctanswer to every
question asked of them. Kids should
be made aware of the complexity of
issues, cultures and societies. They
should be taught to thrive in this
complexity and to continually strive
for a more nuanced understanding
of the world, while always under-
standing their own personal limits
and biases.
It's my belief that all of these
solutions should be practiced on
a larger scale when our society
interacts with other parts of the
world. If we combine humility
and a commitment to continual
learning, Alice Walker's ideal
of friendly diplomacy could
be achieved.

Since 1988, The Smashing
grunge prince Pumpkins
and lead singer BMG
Billy Corgan
has led his ever-changing band
of talented instrumentalists, all
a little afraid of the world and its
blood-sucking tendencies. The

in the early and mid-90s with the
likes of"Cherub Rock"and "1979."
In its heyday, the band achieved
that godly duo: critical and

Every Christmas, there's
somethingI love more
than anything, beyond
the Mariah Careys, Michael Bubs
and Motown classics that populate
every holiday
playlist.While

my car, while
tryingto ADAM
walk through THEISEN
eight inches

in shoes that should only be worn
in the summer, to listen to the
Christmas sounds of a convicted
murderer.
Let me explain.
Phil Spector is,unfortunately, a
huge influence on the development
of pop music. If you somehow
don't know him for his work on.
The Beatles' Let It Be and John
and George's solo work, you know
him for his production on '60s
girl-group classics like "Then He
Kissed Me" and "Be My Baby."
Spector's technique is perhaps
best exemplified by George Harri-
son's "Wah-Wah," fromAll Things
Must Pass. By layering instrument
upon instrument - many ofwhich
played the exact same notes -
Spector produced his trademark
"Wall of Sound," a powerful aes-
thetic that carried songs by sheer
force. On "Wah-Wah," Harrison's
defiant, angry voice is surrounded
on all sides by guitars, percussion
and horns, creating a crashing
wave of music that pummels and

energizes the listeners. Similarly,
over 20 musicians reportedly took
part in the recording of "Be My
Baby," resultinginthe simple,
catchy melody turning into an
all-time classic by a lush, com-
plex orchestra whose percussion

The album marks a slight
departure for the band, which,
in this case, works. Songs
like "Anaiset" are distinctly
Pumpkins but decidedly new,
with interesting yet subtle techno
inflections. "Dorian" follows suit
- it's a catchy, barely electronic
number whose slamming guitars
and characteristically rock vocals
create an awesome juxtaposition
for the ears. Monuments to an
Elegy is laced with dark melodies
andgrungytouchesbutwithcool,
modern beats and conservative
synths. It's not shocking nor
flabbergasting; this is the good
kind of "departure."
Another asset that makes their
modern metamorphosis seamless
is the "throwback" effect. "Anti-
Hero" is the epitome of all that
was great about grunge: angsty
lyrics, clanging guitars, charging
drums and yelling aboutbeingthe
underdog - Corgan's specialties.
It's salvation for the listener to
hear this nostalgia, as it's what
made the Pumpkins smash in
the first place. "One and All (We
Are)" is also a more traditional
one, showcasingbeautifullygrimy
guitars. A few synths find their
way in but at the appropriate
moment and, most importantly,
tactfully. A perfect balance is
struck. a

snaps alongto the beat and whose
stringsglide underneath Ronnie
Spector's beautiful vocals.
Spector also helped record my
favorite Christmas album of all
time, A Christmas Gift For You
From Phil Spector. It's a compila-
tion of classic Christmas songs
performed by Spector-affiliated
groups like The Ronettes and The
Crystals, backed by the Wall of
Sound.A Christmas Gift For You
is everything thatholiday music
should be - upbeat, fun and easy
to sing along to. But ,thanks most-
ly to Spector, it's also extremely
musically advanced. His arrange-
ments combine classic girl-group
tropes (the "ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-
ding-dong-ding" backing vocals
in "Sleigh Ride") with intricate
string and percussion parts, giving
the songs layers of greatness.
A Christmas GiftFor You also
features one of the best Christmas
songs ever cut. Darlene Love,
the record's best vocal asset,
sings "Christmas (Baby Please
Come Home)," the album's only
original song. Theatrical and
impassioned, Love's incredible
powerful voice soars above the
bells and strings and backing
vocals. It's a shout of despair that
somehow sounds triumphant, as
Love through sheer force of will
impresses and energizes listen-
ers.
Although Spector influenced
The Beach Boys and The Beatles
(and, by extension, practi-
cally everyone involved in pop
music from the '60s on), he was
also batshit crazy. He locked
Leonard Cohen out of the stu-
dio while the two were work-
ing on Death of a Ladies' Man
and reportedly threatened the
singer-songwriter with a cross-
bow. Rumor has it he held The
Ramones hostage at gunpoint
while he and the group worked

it over the years. This is especially
evident on "Being Beige," the
first single off the album, where
Corgan hits falsetto in the chorus
for a sweet second and reminds
us of the innate sex appeal in his
nasally nuance. It comes through
on "Run2Me," as well - Corgan's
voice gives the song's electro nods
the edge they need. And he can
bend a vowel like no other singer
in the business, clinging to every

"Monuments" is an interesting
track, with nice, pounding drums
and forceful vocals. But the best
song by far is "Tiberius," the

mimicking the dark melody

melodic rock.
Monuments to an Elegy is

on End of the Century. But the
worst of Spector's actions, obvi-
ously, is his 2003 murder of
singer Lana Clarkson, a crime
that he was convicted of in 2009
and for which he is still serving
a sentence of 19 years to life.
And that's why you should
never listen to the A Christmas
Gift For You's last track, "Silent
Night." Spector talks over sug-
ary, sappy strings playing the
old Christmastime standard,
thanking the listener and the
groups on the record with really
wordy, awkwardly phrased sen-
tences, speaking in his delicate
voice that just sounds slightly off,
probably because you know this
is the voice of insanity. It's slow
and quiet enough to put you to
sleep, but I'd recommend keeping
one eye open. The track will make
your skin crawl everytime.
When I'm listeningto the joy-
ous sounds ofA Christmas Gift
For You, I sometimes snap outcof
it. I realize how awful the person
who created this great music is. I
want to think about the context
and eschew the R. Kellys and the
Ariel Pinks and all the horrible
people who make music. But
somehow, the spiritcof Christmas
overwhelms everything else. The
crazything about pop music is
how it can simplify our lives, fill
our minds with a rush of pleasure
and allow us to forget everything

else. I usually take issue with the
phrase, "Turn offyour brain," but
in the case of Phil Spector, maybe
that's not the worst thing. Maybe,
in this case, it's OK to sit around
the fire and turn on classic holiday
music, focusing on just the music
and what it means to us person-
ally.

Tragic storylines
come together in
'Coda' episode
By MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS
DailyArts Writer d
Spoiler Alert: this review
contains major spoilers for season
five of"The Walking Dead."
"The
Walking A-
Dead" has TeWalking
usually been The i
known for Dead
its explosive
mdesn Season Five
midseason
finales that Mid-Season
serve to Finale
punctuate Returns Feb. 8
the vicious AMC
reality of
the series.
This year's midseason finale,
"Coda," saw a subversion of
the norm for "The Walking
Dead," though, while still
dealing a relatively strong
emotional blow. Rather than
constant escalation, the
episode saw most characters
intentionally avoid killing,
only to see their efforts
tragically fail. "Coda" wasn't
the strongest episode of this
half-season, but it was an
intriguing change of pace that
put previous episodes into
perspective.
Even the opening seemed
to foreshadow an incredibly
violent ending for the Grady
Memorial Hospital storyline,
as Rick (Andrew Lincoln,
"Strike Back") callously
executed the escaping Officer
Bob Lamson (Maximiliano
Hernindez, "The Last Ship").
Lincoln has been a standout
this season, bringing a cold
intensity to Rick, a man who

will protect his group - his
family - at any cost. Rick
eerily echoed Terminus
villain Gareth (Andrew J.
West, "Sguburgatory") saying,
"Can't go back, Bob." Also, it
has not been a good season for
guys named Bob.
Terminus' effect has
resonated differently
throughout the group and
influenced their actions
accordingly. Rick's cold
resolve to leave nothing to
chance was contrasted by the
rest of the group's insistence
that they could rescue fellow
members Beth (Emily Kinney,
"It's Complicated") and Carol
(Melissa McBride, "The
Mist") without killing every
cop in the hospital. While
Rick has seen the events as a
warning about taking a half
measure, other members have
.seen it as a reminder that
they have to maintain their
humanity. .
The Terminus arc
was one of the strongest
storylines for the series and
unfortunately showed some
of the weaknesses of the
Grady Memorial Hospital
story. The group of former
cops, who wielded their old-
world authority tyrannically
while destroying themselves
from the inside, was a unique
opposition. Members of
Grady described the hospital
as "hanging by a thread,"
and this became apparent as
the season moved forward.
The leader of Grady, Dawn
(Christine Woods, "Hello
Ladies"), was treading water,
desperate to maintain her
authority. As she told Beth,
"you have to have their
respect," and Dawn's was
dwindling. However, a lack of
definition for most of Grady's

cops made it tough 'to get a
firm grasp of the hospital.
Who was with Dawn? Who
wasn't? If addressed better,
these questions could have
made Grady a more defined
location.
A major theme 'this season
has been the dynamics
between strength and
weakness, and its effects on
how people survive. Dawn was
a weakening character who
was trying to maintain her
illusion of strength and power
- these attempts led to the
tragic ending of the episode.
The final exchange in the
hospital was a well-executed
climax with tilted camera
angles creating a surreal
tension that painted the scene
as a doomed venture. When
Dawn went back on the deal
(two cops in exchange for Beth
and Carol) and demanded
hospital escapee, Noah (Tyler
Ja'm'es Williams, "Everybody
Hates Chris") as well, she
was making a desperate grab
to maintain her leadership.
While Beth's growing
confidence in opposition
to Dawn was stretched too
far. This over-extension
of strength led to both
charagters' deaths.
However, while previous
finales might have ended this
standout with guns blazing,
the sudden death of innocent
Beth seemed to emotionally
crush the group, while Dawn's
was a weight off Grady. The
group attempted to do the
right thing and still saw its
efforts fail. There was just
no fight left on either side.
The final shot framed the
mourning survivors against
the looming world, with new
wounds, harsh lessons and no
end in sight.

The enigma that is 'the lob'

By MARIAM SHEIKH
For the Daily
Today, a girl in my class
asked me if I liked having
a lob - a long bob. That's a
great question, extremely
relevant to life and all, but
my hair falls past my chest.
Now, is this the byproduct
of pure ignorance or one of
pure confusion from society's
constant need to give every
new trend a short and catchy
name? You be the judge.
Don't get me wrong, I
love the lob - the concept
of it, anyway. It's so very
nonchalant. Not to mention
low-key casually chic. It
serves the purpose of being
sophisticated, but at the same
time it also embodies the
characteristics of its not-so-
distant cousin twice removed
- the mullet, with just that
right mix of business and
party.
Your hairstyle defines you,
I get that more than anyone.

American and NATO troops
end command in Afghanistan

Flag lowering
ceremony marks
emission's formal end
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- American and NATO troops
closed their operational com-
mand in Afghanistan on Mon-
day, lowering flags ina ceremony
to mark the formal end of their
combat mission in a country still
mired in war 13 years after the
U.S.-led invasion toppled the
Taliban regime for harboring
those responsible for 9/1.
The closing of the command,
which oversaw the day-to-day
operations of coalition combat
forces, is one of the final steps
in a transition to a support and
training role that begins Jan.
1. But with President Barack
Obama's recent move authoriz-
ing U.S. forces in Afghanistan
to carry out military operations
against Taliban and al-Qaida
targets, America's longest war
will in fact continue for at least
another two yeays.
Obama's decision to give
American forces a more active
role than previously envisioned
suggests the U.S. is still con-
cerned about the Afghan gov-
ernment's ability to fight. And
agreements signed by Afghan
President Ashraf Ghani to allow
U.S. and NATO troops to remain
in the country are seen as a red
line by the Taliban, further nar-
rowing any hope of peace talks.
Not only are the Taliban a
resilient insurgency, a new gen-
eration of extremists inspired
by Osama bin Laden threatens
the entire region. American
forces are now also involved in
a burgeoning military campaign
against Islamic State group mil-
itants in Syria and Iraq, where
Obama had hoped to end combat
operations three years ago.
As NATO's International
Security Assistance Force's Joint
Command lowered its flag in the
capital, the Taliban carried out
yet another bloody attack, this
time killing a olice officer and
four civilians at a police station
in southern Afghanistan.
Taliban spokesman Zabihul-
lah Mujahid told The Associated
Press that the group would con-

tinue to fight "until all foreign
troops have left Afghanistan."
"The Americans want to
extend their mission in Afghani-
stan, the motive being to keep
the war going for as long as pos-
sible," Mujahid said. "And for as
long as they do, the Taliban will
continue their fight against the
foreign and (Afghan) govern-
ment forces."
From Jan. 1, the coalition
will maintain a force of 13,000
troops in Afghanistan, down
from a peak of about 140,000
in 2011. As of Dec. 1, there were
some 13,300 NATO troops in the
country.
Up to 10,800 U.S. troops
will remain in Afghanistan for
the first three months of next
year, 1,000 more than previ-
ously planned, said a NATO
official who spoke on condition
of anonymity to discuss troop
deployments. By the end of 2015,
however, American officials say
the U.S. troop total will shrink
to 5,500, and to near zero by the
end of 2016.
Obama's recent decision
broadened what had long been
billed as an "advise and assist"
mission set to begin next year,
allowing American forces to
launch operations against the
militants as well as to provide
combat and air support. Afghan
officials have also said that
Ghani is considering a resump-
tion of night raids that could
involve Americans.
Nevertheless, U.S. Gen. John
F. Campbell, commander of
NATO and U.S. forces, said for-
eign troops will now focus on
training and supporting Afghan
soldiers and police, who have
led the fight against the Taliban
insurgents since mid-2013.
"The Afghan security forces
are capable," Campbell said.
"They have to make some
changes in the leadership, which
they're doing, and they have to
hold people accountable."
Ghani, who replaced Presi-
dent Hamid Karzai, is overhaul-
ing Afghanistan's military and
the security apparatus. He has
begun replacing provincial gov-
ernors in volatile areas and his
office said military leaders will
also be replaced. His National
SenrtyConcil kworkng on a

manual that will establish rules
of engagement and battlefield
practices for Afghan security
forces.
As Afghan troops have
stepped up, they have been killed
in record numbers. Afghan secu-
rity casualties spiked 6.5 per-
cent this year, with 4,634 killed
in action. By comparison, some
3,500 foreign forces, including
at least 2,210 American soldiers,
have been killed since the war
began in 2001.
Afghan officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity to dis-
cuss their intelligence analysis,
say they believe Taliban attacks
will only increase in Decem-
ber and January as the mili-
tants react to Ghani's embrace
of a continued foreign military
presence. They also blamed
Pakistan's intelligence agencies
- which they have long accused
of quietly supporting the mili-
tants - for the surge in violence,
even though relations between
the two countries have thawed
in recent months since Ghani's
election.
"I don't think the war will
slow or stop during the winter,
as attacks on cities are not con-
tingent on the weather," Afghan
political analyst Wahid Muzh-
dah said. "I believe attacks in
the cities will increase."
In recent weeks, the Tali-
ban have hit foreign targets,
including military, diplomatic
and civilian installations. Four
foreigners, including a British
Embassy security guard and a
South African charity worker
and his two teenage children,
have been killed in Kabul.
Five attackers died in Mon-
day's attack on the police sta-
tion, including one who blew
himself up, said Samim Akh-
plwak, the spokesman for the
Kandahar provincial governor.
The attack also wounded seven
people.
In the restive eastern prov-
ince of Nangahar, three headless
bodies were found, according
to the governor's spokesman,
Ahmad Zia Abdulzai. He said
four people had been kidnapped
"a couple of days ago." One intact
body was found on Sunday but it
was unclear if the bodies were
those of the kidnapped.

CHARLES KoWALEC/Daily
Neurologist Jeffrey S. Kutcher, Associate Professor of Neurology and the Director of the NeuroSport program, discusses
head injuries, concussions, and post-concussion syndrome during the Myths and Realities of Youth Sport Head injuries
lecture held at Hatcher Graduate Library Monday.

INJURIES
From Page 1
USA at the Winter Olympics in
Sochi, Russia, and he has worked
at various times with the NHL
and NBA in developing concus-
sion policies.
While a large portion of
Kutcher's presentation was dedi-
cated to explaining the science
behind concussion diagnosis
and treatment, he also argued
against false reports inthe media
that can misrepresent current
research or inaccurately corre-
late concussions with a variety of
short-term and long-term symp-
toms.
"This is where medicine is in
the conversation," Kutcher said.
"We're off to the side and pushed
to the back."
One point that Kutcher
stressed was the distinction
between a concussion, post-con-
cussionsyndrome andthe chron-
ic effects of playingsports. While
media reports often address the
three interchangeably or col-
lectively as "concussions," each
has its distinct causes, symptoms
and treatment.
Kutcher denied the belief that
concussions cause depression
and suicide, an idea that has been
perpetuated for many years,
most recently brought to the
forefront following the death of
Ohio State lineman Kosta Kara-
george, whose bodywas found in
a dumpster near his apartment
on Nov. 30, the day after Michi-
gan traveled to Columbusfor its
annual rivalry game against the
Buckeyes.

Authorities believe that the
22-year-old, who had been
reported missing since earlier
that week, took his own life with
a single gunshot wound to the
head..The Wednesday before his
body was found, he sent a text
message to his mother that read,
"Sorry ifI am an embarrassment,
but these concussions have my
head all fucked up."
In an interview with Sports
Illustrated, Franklin County
coroner Anahi Ortiz said Kara-
george's autopsy will include
brain examinations "because
of his history being involved in
high-impact sports, because of
his history of concussions."
In contrast, Kutcher said
reported instances of depression,
dementia and suicide among
athletes are tied to the "chronic
effects of playing sports on the
brain," and should not be viewed
as an outcome of a single concus-
sion.
"(These chronic effects) have
nothing to do with concussions
really at all, it's a separate entity
altogether," he said.
Kutcher blamed media cover-
age for a slew ofhigh-profile play-
er suicides at the professional,
collegiate and high school level,
citing guidelines published by
the Centers for Disease Control
in 2008 that called on such orga-
nizations to realize the potential
for improper or inappropriate
reporting of one suicide to trig-
ger other suicides in the same
community - a phenomenon he
believes may be occurring among
football players.
Kutcher discussed the mis-
guided understanding of the
effects of concussions on long-
term brain damage, another
major issue currently facing pro-
fessional athletics.
A recent study of 5,000 retired
NFL players reported higher
rates of severe brain damage in
retired players than in the gen-
eral population, The New York
Times reported in September.
Additionally, the report found
that symptoms of brain damage
generally manifested at younger
ages amongthis group.
In response to the study, the
NFL, which has faced criticism
for previously denying such
claims, agreed to pay out almost
$1 billion to former players suf-
fering from Alzheimers, demen-
tia, Parkinson's disease and a
variety of other neurodegenera-
tive disorders.
"That's clearly not founded in
any kind of science at all," Kutch-
er said. "It's really an economi-
cally driven, actuarial-driven

(public relations) move and not a
scientific one."
The NFL has also faced criti-
cism based on reports of an
increased prevalence of chronic
traumatic encephalopathy in
retired professional football
players, among other conditions.
CTE, which is presumed to be the
result of repeated impacts to the
head, results in higher observed
levels of the naturally occurring
protein Tau in the brain.
While studies have shown
higher levels of Tau in the brains
of former NFL players, Kutcher
said the clinical symptoms are so
differentbetween patients that it
calls into question the role of the
protein in the brain.
Event attendee Philip Veliz, an
assistant professor at the Univer-
sity's Institute for Research on
Women and Gender, was inter-
ested in learning about the prop-
er age to get children involved in
contact sports such as wrestling.
He said he realizes that many
sports require children to start
learning at a young age, but wor-
ries that doing so could put them
at risk developmentally.
Additionally, Veliz said he
appreciated Kutcher's expertise
in concussion research, but dis-
agreed with his assessment of
violence in sport. While Kutcher
said contact sports are valuable
in providing violence-prone indi-
viduals a physical outlet to vent
their anger, Veliz said he feels
thisputs such individualsat risk
of not being able to cope with vio-
lence after they leave the sport.
Similarly to Veliz, Ann Arbor
resident Bethany Williston was
interested in gathering informa-
tion about head injuries in youth
sports. She said she sometimes
worries about her three children,
who all play soccer.
"Each season there's eight
games, and each season in at least
one of the games I see something
where I ask, 'Is that kid OK?' "
Williston said.
She said the talk allowed her
to gain a better understanding
of how to spot a suspected con-
cussion and ensure that players
remain safe.
Monday's presentation was
the final installment in a series
hosted through the Univer-
sity's Theme Semester, "Sport
and the University." Prior to
Kutcher's address, English Prof.
Anne Curzan, a co-organizer. of
the Theme Semester, discussed
the importance of sport to the
University and the many ways
in which it interacts with the
school's various departments
and disciplines.

and police would have to be out in
larger numbers for two more hours
as well," Root wrote in ane-mail.
The bill stipulates that 85 per-
cent ofthe funds from the extended
hours permit fee would go to local
police departments, which could
potentially alleviate some safety
concerns.
Safetyissues aside, Rootalsosaid
he doesn't think that the two extra
hours of service would necessarily
be good business. He wrote thathe
feels sales would just be stretched
out across those two hours and not
lead to increased revenue, but the
extended hours would certainly
increase operatingcosts.
While Root was skeptical about
the bill's potential benefits for Ann
Arbor businesses, others feel it
could be beneficial in other parts
of the state, especially downtown

Detroit.
"I think in some places in
Detroit (the bill) would probably
help their business big time,"said
David Starzyk, general manager
of Arbor Brewing Company, who
has had extensive past experience
working in Detroit bars. Starzyk
did, however, share Root's con-
cerns about safety issues.
Despite Root's concerns, Irwin
said staying open later would still
be of interest for some South Uni-
versity establishments, but cau-
tioned that the Council "will have
to weigh that with the relationship
the city has had with those opera-
tors (and) with the public safety
concerns that City Council has."
Irwin also added that the Uni-
versity would likely want input
regarding how to treat the South
Universityareaunderthe potential
new law.
"I know the city is always clam-
oring for more input into deci-
sions that the University makes, so
maybe it could be an opportunity
for the city and University to work
together on something and hope-
fully that will be a place where the
two entities can compromise," he
said.

Hoke speaks, 'M' names captains

MEN'S BASKETBALL
In EMU, Michigan
expects to rebound

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
LIVONIA, Mich. - Former
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke walked behind his seniors
on the stage at the team's annual
banquet. He chatted for half
a minute with players before
moving on to the others as if it
were any other day in Ann Arbor.
He received a standing ovation
in a room full of hundreds
of players, family members,
coaches, alumni and fans before
he could speak.
And though it was his first
chance to address the public
since he was fired Tuesday, the 12
seniors who spoke on his impact
overshadowed Hoke's words.
"Brady Hoke, -Greg Hardin
and Michigan football saved my
life," said near teary-eyed fifth-
year senior punter Will Hagerup.
y "Coach Hoke risked everything
for me. He took bullets for me
and my team the entire season.
When it comes to caring and
believing in his players, Brady
Hoke does, more than any head
coach in this country.
"This team has had an
incredible honor and privilege
to follow him and learn from
him for four years."

I have ever been around in my

for everything you've taught me

so much more than football and

The Michigan men's
basketball team didn't lose back-
to-back games last season, and
coming off a loss to New Jersey
Institute of Technology, the
Wolverines will look to continue
that trend Tuesday when they
face Eastern Michigan.
Michigan dropped a 72-70
contest to the nation's lone
independent Division I team
Saturday, a result Michigan
coach John Beilein called
humbling.
So when the Eagles visit
Crisler Center Tuesday, it's a
safe bet Michigan will be itching
to get rolling. But as has been
the case for the Wolverines' last
two games, they'll have to do
so with limited contributions
from sophomore guard Derrick
Walton Jr.
Walton sprained a toe in
Michigan's loss at Villanova in
the Progressive Legends Classic
Nov. 25 and hasn't been at full
strength since. He posted 16
points against the Highlanders
in 38 minutes, but he played
more as a result of surprise
necessity than because he was
fully ready, and he turned the
ball over a season-high four
times. Beilein said Walton sat
out all of Sunday's practice.
"I held him out yesterday 100
percent," Beilein said. "He just
did a little bit of light shooting
and did his weight training. I
thought that was key, because he
wasn't moving well defensively
in the game."
Beilein said he still expects
Walton to play, but the guard is
still in recovery mode.
Junior guard Spike Albrecht,
who was instrumental in
Michigan's win over Syracuse a
week ago, will likely be looked
to against an Eastern Michigan

team that plays the same 2-3
zone as the Orange. The junior
carved up Syracuse with bounce
passes and a dagger 3-pointer.
While the Eagles don't present
the same level of athleticism,
they're a threat in their own
right, especially on the glass.
If Michigan wants to rebound
from its loss, it will have to,
well, rebound.
The Wolverines enter the
game ranked 263rd nationally in
boardspergame at32.8, nowhere
near the Eagles' impressive
mark of 42.5, good for 16th in
the country. Boasting 6-foot-11
center Mike Samuels, Eastern
Michigan should have a height
advantage in the post all night.
And when the Eagles turn to
offense, Ray Lee, coming off a
26-point effort against Dayton
on Saturday, has proven he can
score points in bunches.
"The good news is that it is
very similar to the zone Syracuse
plays," Beilein said. "The bad
news is it's very similar, so now
we've put our whole package out
there. Now, they actually have a
real scout (team), where usually
you can't really tell that.
"They have depth, they really
have put together a good run
here, they gave Dayton a heck of
a game. Just the physical bodies,
how big they are inside (is a
challenge),"
Key to that effort will be
junior guard Caris LeVert, who
scored a career-high 32 points
against NJIT. LeVert shot six-
of-eight from beyond the arc
and, while he won't be expected
to duplicate those numbers, it is
becoming clear he is the go-to
guy when things break down for
the Wolverines.
Eastern Michigan is no
"guarantee game," but it's
hard to imagine Michigan
overlooking the Eagles after
Saturday's loss.

Wolverines faces stiff testin
unbeaten Princetonsquad

By JACOB GASE
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan women's basketball
coach Kim Barnes Arico couldn't
have asked for a better start to
the 2014 campaign.
Despite their lack of size,
the Wolverines have used a
balanced offense to produce a 6-1
record - the team's best start in
Barnes Arico's three seasons at
Michigan.
.But when Michigan takes
the court Tuesday night, it will
face an opponent riding an even
stronger wave of momentum:
undefeated Princeton.
The Tigers (8-0) are off to the
best start in Ivy League history.
Princeton also edged the one
team that bested Michigan. One
week before the Wolverines
suffered their only loss at
Pittsburgh, the Tigers dropped
the Panthers by 16 points on the
same court.
Princeton - Michigan's only
home opponent so far to receive
votes in the AP poll - stands as
the Wolverines' last true test at
Crisler Center before the start of
Big Ten play in three weeks.
To snap the Tigers' unbeaten
streak and continue rolling
into a daunting matchup with
No. 2 Notre Dame on Saturday,
Michigan's offense needs to fire
on all cylinders as the defense
continues to improve. Barnes
Arico emphasized that point
Monday evening on Fox Sports
Detroit's "Inside Michigan
Basketball" special.
"I really like the way our
team shares the basketball,"
Barnes Arico said on the show.
"I really like how unselfish we
are and how we're committed to
improving on the defensive end.
That's something we struggled
with early, and I think we're
getting better and better at it.
Everybody's buying into 'the
team, the team, the team."'
The Wolverines can
take comfort in that they
won't be playing at quite a
size disadvantage Tuesday.

Princeton's starters stand at
an average of 5-foot-10, which
should come as a relief after
Michigan's game against a Wake
Forest team featuring multiple
six-footers,
Instead of doing its damage

But the only time this season

defense in the 21-point loss to
