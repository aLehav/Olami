Decision differs
from recent
rulings across
the nation
By SHOHAM GEVA
DailyStaffReporter
The ban against same-sex
marriage in Michigan was
upheld in a decision announced
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit on Thursday
afternoon, reversing a March
decision from the district
court.
The three-member panel
of judges in the case, who first
heard oral arguments from
both sides in August, along with
five other cases from the region,
voted 2-1 to uphold the ban.
This decision is the first from a
circuit court to uphold a ban on
same-sex marriage following
multiple decisions nationwide
that have made same-sex mar-

riage legal in 35 states.
Thursday's decision also
encompassed rulings against
more narrow measures sur-
rounding the recognition of
same-sex marriages'performed
outside ofMichigan andofdeath
and birth certificate rights for
same-sex couples, both stem-
ming from cases brought by the
other atates in the Sixth Circuit.
The majority opinion in the
case, written by Judge Jeffrey
Sutton, framed the eventual
legalization of same-sex mar-
riage as an inevitability, but
upheld the ban based on one
key issue: whether the decision
on the legalization of same-sex
marriage should be made by the
courts.
"Our judicial commissions
did not come with such a sweep-
ing grant of authority, one that
would allow just three of us -
just two of us in truth - to make
such a vital policy call for the 32
million citizens who live within
the four States of the Sixth Cir-

Middle East
expert talk covers
potential for
two-state solution
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
Discussions of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict continued
Thursday as a member of Sec-
retary of State John Kerry's
negotiating team spoke to a
crowd of more than 60 stu-
dents and community mem-
bers.
David Makovsky, profes-
sor of Middle East studies at
Johns Hopkins University,
lead the lecture in South Hall.
Makovsky is also a Ziegler
Distinguished Fellow and the
Director of the Project on the
Middle East Peace Process at
the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy.
Over a 10-month period,
Makovsky worked with
Kerry on peace negotiations
between Palestinians and
Israelis and over territory in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Though Kerry hoped to reach
a final status agreement by
April 2014, the talks ultimate-
ly fell apart last spring.
"When Secretary Kerry
came in as Secretary of State
and made this a priority, he
said, 'How can it be that both
sides want a two-state solu-
tion? Each one is doing it for
their own self-interest of
course, but they overlap. Why
can't we take this issue and
move on it?"'

Despite intense nego-
tiations, Makovsky said the
teams were able to narrow,
but not close, gaps during
framework talks. He said this
occurred in part because risk-
averse leaders did not want
to jump too far ahead on the
most controversial and emo-
tionally charged issues. How-
ever, ie said Kerry's team was
able to assist in initiating a
ceasefire in August after vio-
lence erupted in the region for
much of the summer.
"The big thing for the gov-
ernment was trying to find
a way to end the Gaza War
and that meant a ceasefire,"
Makovsky said. "We had a
clear strategy that we want-
ed this war to end without
Hamas gaining, but reinstat-
ing the Palestinian Author-
ity in Gaza because Hamas
had taken over this place and
held the Gazans hostage since
2007."
During the lecture,
Makovsky also stressed the
importance of college-aged
students working to promote
values such as acceptance and
dialogue, rather than hostility
of conflict.
"I feel it's very important
that American campuses did
not import the politics of con-
frontation from the Middle
East but rather exports of pol-
itics of coexistence and of tol-
erance and pluralism that are
really hallmarks of American
society," he said. "I feel that as
being an eyewitness to official
dialogue between Israelis and
Palestinians, if they can sit at
the table and narrow their dif-

Students develop
projects designed to

East Lansing
By PARISHA NOVA
Daily StaffReporter
The Spartans couldn't figure
it out, so they're commissioning
Wolverines to fix East Lansing's
parking woes.
The 2014 Ford School Case
Competition is an opportunity
for Public Policy graduate stu-
dents to work collaboratively to
address the parking needs in the
city of East Lansing. The inaugu-
ral kickoff event for the competi-
tion took place in Weill Hall on
Thursday night.
Teams of three to five Master
of Public Policy degree candidates
will collaborate in finding cre-
ative solutions to East Lansing's
parking issues. Home of Michi-
gan State University, the city
struggles to provide an adequate
number of spots for all students
and residents. The team with the
best solution will have the oppor-
tunity to present their proposal to
the East Lansing City Council. If
deemed feasible and efficient, it
might be implemented.
The idea for the Case Com-
petition was created last spring
from Ford School of Public Policy
graduate students. This competi-
tion evolved into medium term
cases of 10 days, as opposed to
solely a weekend or 24 hours -

Council considers
cold-weather shelter

Mobile technology
impacts 'U' learning

Report recommends
expanding warming
stations for homeless
By JACK TURMAN
Daily StaffReporter
With a relatively light agen-
da, Thursday's lame-duck City
Council session featured dis-
cussion on affordable housing
and the Washtenaw County
Office of Community and Eco-
nomic Development's report on
providing shelter for those in
need during this winter.
Following last winter's
extreme weather, the office
formed a response workgroup
to better respond to the chal-
lenges faced by the homeless
during extreme winter weather.
This workgroup, which began
meeting over the summer, lis-
tened to the city's concerns and
-HS

formulated ways to improve
services and shelter offerings.
Mary Jo Callan, director of
the office of Community and
Economic Development, and
Ellen Schulmeister, executive
director of the Shelter Asso-
ciation of Washtenaw County,
went before the Council to pro-
pose four recommendations
to improve shelter services,
carrying an estimated cost of
$178,000.
Callan said this set of recom-
mendations includes expand-
ing overnight warming centers
to three churches on a rotat-
ing basis, expanding a daytime
warming center at the Delonis
Center, expanding services at the
Ann Arbor District Library and
increasing funding for hotel and
motel stays through Community
Support and Treatment Services.
While presenting the report,
Callan emphasized the impor-
tance of overnight and daytime
H-m

warming centers.
Last year, she said the Delo-
nis Centerconstantly struggled
with overcrowding.
"There were nights when
they had 89 people in a space
designed for SO," Callan said.
"That's too many."
Mayor John Hieftje (D) said
he learned 40 percent of the
people cared for at the shel-
ter were not from Washtenaw
County.
He said that while no one was
turned away from the shelter,
the resulting overcrowding took
a toll on the staff.
"The staff at the shelter was
strained to the very breaking
point and they managed to pull
that off," Hieftje said.
With discussion of homeless-
ness, Callan stressed that these
recommendations aren't a per-
manent solution to homeless-
ness and affordable housing.
"This is not a recommenda-
tion for how to solve homeless-
ness this winter," she said. "It is
a set of recommendations that
really looks at some immediate
safety solutions."
In regard to affordable hous-
ing, Hieftje clarified that the
city cannot mandate affordable
housing. Instead, he said it is a
complex process that requires
collaboration with nonprof-
its and the Ann Arbor Hous-
ing Commission, among other
stakeholders.
"We have to work with the
availability of tax-credit financ-
ing," Hieftje said. "We have to
work with people who might be
willing to build that."
Callan said this issue of
homelessness correlates with
affordable housing, an issue
that has been discussed numer-
ous times at Council meetings.
"Until we have enough of
affordable housing and appro-
priate substance use and mental
health treatment, we're going
to have folks who are homeless,"
Callan said. "It's a huge chal-
lenge for policymakers."

MARRIAGE
From Page 1
cuit: Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio,
and Tennessee," Sutton wrote.
Later in the decision, he wrote
that same-sex marriage propo-
nents have not clearly justified
the case to make the definition of
marriage - and the subsequent
rights and recognition attached
to that definition - a constitu-
tional issue.
Michigan's case, DeBoer v.
Snyder, was initially brought by
Hazel ParkresidentsAprilDeBo-
er and Jayne Rowse because they
were unable to jointly adopt their
children. Several months after
the initial case was brought, a
judge offered them the option of
broadening it to an overall chal-
lenge of Michigan's same-sex
marriage ban.
In an interview Thursday
evening, Jay Kaplan, project
staff attorney for the ACLU of
Michigan's LGBT Rights Proj-
ect, said the decision didn't take
into account the function of the
courts as a check on the power of
the legislative branch.
The ACLU stated earlier in the
afternoon that they would appeal
the decision to the Supreme
Court.
"We relyonthecourtsbecause
we know we can't rely on the
will of the majority always to do
the right or the fair thing, and
that's one of the functions of our
courts," Kaplan said. "Judge Sut-
ton, in his opinion, seems to have
totally lost sight of that."
In a statement Thursday
afternoon, Michigan Attorney
General Bill Schuette (R), who
has argued in favor of the ban

and brought the appeal to the
Sixth Circuit against the dis-
trict court's ruling, applauded
the decision and said he looked
forward to a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling on the issue.
"The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit has ruled, and
Michigan's constitution remains
in full effect," Schuette said.
"As I have stated repeatedly, the
U.S. Supreme Court will have
the final word on this issue. The
sooner they rule, the better,, for
Michigan and the country."
Last year, the Supreme Court
chose to rule in favor of federal
recognition for same-sex cou-
ples in a variety of areas, strik-
ing down aspects of the Defense
of Marriage Act. Earlier this
year, the Court declined to hear
appeals to cases striking down
same-sex marriage bans, but was
expected to step in should a cir-
cuit courtuphold the ban.
In Ann Arbor, members of the
LGBTQ community and allies
gathered Thursday night to dis-
cuss the decision at the Jim Toy
Community Center, a Washt-
enaw County organization that
is a self-described local resource
for LGBTQ individuals and their
allies. Sandi Smith, president of
the center, said in an interview
after the event Thursday evening
that the local community was
still exploring its options.
"Right now the people are
gathering; they are a little bit
in emotional shock," she said.
"I think there's some consola-
tion happening, and we've got
some people that are trying to go
through the opinions that were
published ... and trying to make
sense of it."
Smith added that along with

an appeal, the group was also
looking into launching a cam-
paign to place a proposal related
to the legalization of same-sex
marriage on the 2016 ballot.
Another case in the state,
stemming from the same-sex
marriage ban concerning the
legality of the marriages of the
almost 300 couples who married
in the 24-hour period between
the district court's decision to
strike down the ban and the
issuing of an emergency stay
on the decision, as requested by
Schuette, is still pending in the
courts. A preliminary hearing
for the case was held in August.
In a statement Thursday after-
noon, Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der reaffirmed his position on
the legality of the marriages by
following the language in the
state constitution. He wrote that
he "took an oath to support and
defend our state constitution,
without exceptions."
Public Policy junior Nick
Rinehart, chair of Central Stu-
dent Government's LGBT*Q
Commission, said the lack of pro-
gression of the marriage equal-
ity movement in Michigan was
disappointing, especially for
University students considering
their options in the state.
"It certainly doesn't help the
state of Michigan's case in the
circumstance when LGBT stu-
dents or allies see that their state
is not willing to stand up for all
of its citizens," he said. "It's defi-
nitely discouraging for a lot of
people. I know that it's not mak-
ing me want to stay in Michigan

Tennessee vote waves the
protection for abortions

Amendment to
state constitution
oversteps Roe v.
Wade ruling
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)
- While the rest of the South
slowly whittled away at abor-
tion access, Tennessee's clinics
operated under less stringent
restrictions.
That is about to change.
Voters on Tuesday approved
altering the state constitution
to make clear that it does not
protect the right to an abor-
tion - despite the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling
establishing a nationwide right
to abortion - and legislators
are already talking about man-
datory counselling and waiting
periods to bring Tennessee in
line with the eight surround-
ing states. The legislature meets
again in January.
The amendment, approved by
53 percent of voters, was a slow
motion response to a Tennessee
Supreme Court ruling in 2000
that said abortion was protected
by the state constitution. The
amendment was brought before
the legislature four months
after that decision, but it took
nearly 14 years to become law
because of political opposition
and the state's lengthy referen-
dum process.
"Clearly, I think the legisla-
ture wants to put commonsense
legislation in place to make sure
that abortion is a safe procedure
in Tennessee and to restore the
state to being in-line with the
states around us," said House
Speaker Beth Farwell, a Nash-

ville Republican.
Abortion rights supporters
are worried that lawmakers
will go too far. After the amend-
ment passed, American Civil
Liberties Union of Tennessee
Executive Director Hedy Wein-
berg issued a statement warn-
ing politicians that "extreme,
medically-irrelevant laws will
be strongly opposed by voters."
The hard-fought campaign
over Amendment 1 brought in
more than $5.5 million, much
of that raised by abortion rights
advocates from Planned Par-
enthood affiliates across the
country who fought it. The two
sides spent nearly $4.5 million
in October alone, much of that
going toward television adver-
tisements.
Opponents portrayed Ten-
nessee as an "abortion destina-
tion," playing up that almost
23 percent of the women get-
ting abortions in Tennessee are
from out of state, according to
the Tennessee Department of
Health.
That statistic is a little mis-
leading. Before the rules were
relaxed by the state Supreme
Court decision in 2000, 19 per-
cent of abortions here were per-
formed on women from other
states.
Border states include Mis-
sissippi, where the only abor-
tion clinic faces closure over a
2012 state law that is currently
tied up in the courts, and Mis-
souri, one of only three states
that require women to wait 72
hours between when they seek
an abortion and when they can
obtain one.
Elizabeth Nash is a policy
analyst with the Guttmacher
Institute, a research organiza-

tion that supports legal access
to abortion. She said if Tennes-
see adopts laws like those in
the surrounding states, abor-
tion will become more difficult
and expensive for women in the
state. She doubted that lawmak-
ers could cut off access entirely.
"If the goal here is to shut
abortion clinics, I imagine they
will be fairly successful," she
said. "To go from eight clinics to
zero probably won't happen."
Abortion rights advocates
had better success Tuesday in
Colorado and North Dakota,
where voters decisively rejected
measures that-opponents feared
could lead to bans on abortion.
The Colorado proposal would
have added "unborn human
beings" to the state's criminal
code; the North Dakota measure
would have declared in the state
constitution that "the inalien-
able right to life of every human
being at every stage of develop-
ment must be recognized and
protected."
Nationally, advocacy groups
on opposite sides of the abortion
debate drew different lessons
from the election results.
Abortion rights support-
ers, though dismayed by the
defeats of some of their Demo-
cratic allies in Congress, were
heartened that some Republican
candidates triumphed after soft-
ening previous stances on abor-
tion and reproductive health.
Anti-abortion groups, mean-
while, were pleased by the infu-
sion of more conservatives in
both chambers of Congress, and
said they now expect the Senate
- under GOP control as of Janu-
ary - to take up a House-passed
bill that would ban most abor-
tions after 20 weeks.

from," she said. "We want stu-
dents to know that."
The process ofrecoveringfood
is fairly simple but is one that has
a substantial impact, said Engi-
neering senior Joey Letner.

"The dining staff takes the
leftover food, puts in aluminum
pans that we provide, puts it in
freezers, and then our chapter
picks up the food and brings it to
the Ann Arbor Food Gatherers.
From there, it's distributed to
various places, such as the Delo-
nis Center and other homeless
centers or churches that have

food pantries.".
LSA senior Colleen Rathz, the
event coordinator, stressed the
importance of being conscious of
what to do with your food.
"Repurpose your leftovers,
put it in the fridge, or give it to
a friend," she said. "There are so
many better options than throw-
ing food in the garbage."

After his lecture, audience
members asked questions about
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
and other topics. Questions
ranged from Iranian nuclear
negotiations to the influence of
the media on the talks.
LSA junior Becca Levin, one
of the program's organizers, said
the event was sponsored by the
Israeli Campus Coalition and
Hillel with the purpose of bring-
ing another perspective on the
conflict to campus.
COMPETITION

tions.
The teams are provided with
Public Policy alumni as men-
tors, and specifically alumni who
are working in city government
capacities or have other public
sector experience, to incorporate
real-world knowledge and ideas
into the case.
"Mentors will help to guide
students and push them to
think about the different risks
involved with the proposal, how
those risks could be mitigated,
to think about the gaps in their
thinking that would ultimately
be addressed by the city council
when they are presenting their
proposals just so they are ready
and have thought about all the
externalities," Patten said.
The teams are encouraged
to visit East Lansing to better
understand the context and situ-
ation of the problem.

"We wanted to educate stu-
dents onaninsider's pointofview
and talking about these nego-
tiations," Levin said. "I think it's
super important because a lot
of times we get our news from
social media or just one place and
it's really important to take a step
back and really think about the
news and that way we can talk
to each other about ways to move
forward."
Makovsky said it's also impor-
tant for University students to be
aware of issues of conflict in the
Middle East because they impact
other foreign policy objectives as
well.
"If there's instability in the
Middle East, I think what we've

learned is that it affects every-
one," he said. "It leads to wars,
it leads to conflict. There's no
doubt jihadists exploit this
conflict to gain recruits and
we need peace. I think that will
take a card out of their hands. I
don't think it would end terror-
ism but I think it could lower
the flame."
He also stressed the impor-
tance of not giving up on finding
a two-state solution.
"We shouldn't see every
obstacle as a pretext not to do
anything," he said. "If we can't
hit a home run, we should hit
a double, a single, even a triple,
whatever we can do, even if we
can't solve it all."

"I'mgoingt continuetolivehere.
and be ataxpayer," Hieftje said.
Peterson, whose first term on
Council ends this year, ran for
mayor and therefore relinquished
her eligibility to run as an incum-
bent for her Council seat. During
her time on Council, Petersen
emphasized and used her busi-
ness background to focus on eco-
nomic issues in the city.
During her campaign for
mayor, she ran against fellow
councilmembers Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), Steve Kunselman
(D-Ward 3) and Taylor, receiving
15.90 percent of the vote in the
Democratic primary.
As her time on Council ends,
Petersen said she hopes to con-

tinue serving Ann Arbor through
the Disabilities Commission. At
Thursday's meeting, the Council
voted unanimously to tioiinate
Petersen as Chairof the-Disabili-
ties Commission.
Petersen said she was grate-
ful for Hieftje's welcome to the
Council, as he gave her the oppor-
tunity to take a leadership role on
committees.
"I thank everyone here
because people have been open-
minded," Petersen said. "People
have been willing to listen."
Known as a champion for the
neighborhoods of Ann Arbor,
Teall has served on the Coun-
cil for 12 years for the fourth
ward. In addition to her time on
Council, Teall also served on the
Environmental Commission, the
Administrative Committee, the
board of directors for the annual

FestiFools festival and the Labor
Committee, among others.
As Teall's tenure comes to a
close, she said she has been nos-
talgic and has looked at past
e-mails to reflect on what being a
councilmember meant to her and
to sumup her Council experience.
"It's meant a ton," she said.
"You know, I've been here 12
years and I'm floored by how
much we've accomplished in
the 14 years since we've had our
mayor. We don't talk about the
same problems now. I am very
lucky to have served with so
many fabulous staff members."
Teall also said she has no
intentions at this time of running
for public office again.
"Working with organizations,
nonprofits and such," she said,
"(that) would be something I'd
like to do."


"We are going up to visit the
city to gain a personal perspec-
tive. One of my team members
is from there. It should be inter-
esting to see what the city is like,
what lessons we can pile from
having not lived in a University
town," said Rasheed Malik, a
Public Policy graduate student.
The teams are expected to use
problem-solving skills to formu-
late and test hypotheses, develop
work plans and issue different
kinds of analysis. The teams are
provided with real data that they
are expected to analyze and use
for solutions and proposals.
A judging rubric is available
for the first round of the compe-
tition. Based on a numeric scale
of 65 points, the first-round judg-
ing focuses on the identification,
interpretation and analysis of the
case, and the ability of the team
to explain and defend its case
and strategy. Most importantly,
the proposal must be legal, fiscal-
ly sound and politically feasible.
The rubric also includes the need

for the demonstration of origi-
nality and creativity.
The competition attracted
students from different back-
grounds for several reasons.
"I am an international student.
I am really interested in issues of
urban policy. And this would be
my only chance to work within
the local government framework
and I was very interested to see
how they operate," said Sneha
Rao, a Public Policy graduate
student.
The kickoff event will be fol-
lowed by a first round of selec-
tion, designed to engage with
clients for scheduled calls, to ask
questions and request additional
information. The second round
of selection will focus on the
advancing team's improvement
of their submitted proposals and
the development of their oral
presentations.
The 2014 Case Competition
showcase and awards event will
take place at 1210 Weill Hall on
Nov.21 from 12:30 p.m.to2p.m.

HEMA KARUNAKARAM I
Sa
Mylastname, Karunakaram,has a
beautifulhistorythatdatesbackabout
four generations. Karunakaram,
meaning "kind hands" in Sanskrit,
was a title bestowed upon my great-
great-grandfather for his generosity
and service to the local government
of the time, in the coastal region of
Andhra Pradesh, India. Although the
family had a different surname, this
ancestor decided to pass on his new
title of Karunakaram to his children,
preserving the legacy that he had
created.
But four-year-old me didn't know
this story. Four-year-old me cared
less about history and meaning, and
more about finding a way to quickly
say my Indian name in the middle of
an English sentence during school.
Somehow, this meant corrupting
the pronunciation of my last name:
in shortening the "na," stressing the
second syllable instead of the third,
and replacing the soft, malleable rs
with hard, definite ones, four-year-
old me devised a new - and incorrect
- way to say my own name.
The modification was easy enough
to navigate. At Indian gatherings
(such as parties or cultural and reli-
gious activities), I'd say my name
correctly, but in non-Indian crowds
(like in school) I'd use the modi-
fied pronunciation. Conveniently,
because I spent most of my childhood
in a very white school district, these
two sets of people rarely overlapped,
and switching back and forth felt so
natural that I soon forgot I was even
doing it.
It wasn't until my freshman year
of college that these circles began to
intersect and my cover was blown.
One of my best friends pointed out
during a 2 a.m. heart-to-heart the
hypocrisy of claiming to be a proud
Indian-American but compromising
my own name, saying that "if they
can't say your name right, it's their
problem, not yours." She urged me
to, at the very least, "just pick a
pronunciation and stick to it."
So I did. After 14 years, I chose to
use the correct pronunciation of my
name with everyone, for good.
Indian languages (among many
others) do not lend themselves eas-
ily to English adaptation. A single
Indian name could be spelled eight
different ways in English because 26
letters are not nearly enough to cap-
ture the nuances of its pronunciation
and meaning. I'd like to think it's at
least worth the effort to try and say
things properly, but sometimes it's
tiring to have to repeat my name
two, three, five times before you get
it right.
People with non-Western cultural
roots frequently find themselves
in this constant balancing act -
retaining their traditions while
trying to assimilate smoothly into

ityameva Jaya
Western expectations. Stories of
modified or abbreviated names like
mine are so common that they've
come to be expected. All too often,
this is a country where Krishna
becomes Kris and Sandhya becomes
Sandy and Rajeev becomes Raj. Even
everyone's beloved comedienne
Mindy Kaling abbreviated her last
name fromthe authentic, brimming-
with-meaning Chokalingam. The
impossiblegoalseemstobetoappear
different and yet not different all at
the same time. But is it okay to make
a name easier to say at the cost of its
meaning and history?
A prime example of this
compromise on campus is the Indian
American Student Association's
annual cultural show. Although I
was an active member of IASA for
three years and still support its
commitmentto"preserve and cherish
our culture," I have long disagreed
with some of its repeated choices.
Year after year, we see names like
"Samasti," "Zastana," and "Silesha"
plastered across campus in October
and November. And year after year,
performers and audiences alike
assume that since IASA - the oldest
and largest Indian organization on
campus - came up with these names,
they must be authentic.
Unfortunately, a quick Google
search will tell you they usually
aren't.
In most recent years, the title of
the IASA show has generally been
a three-syllable word that might be
loosely based on a Hindi or Sanskrit
word, but has been modified and
embellished to supposedly cater to
a Western audience - a process by
which the title itself ends up with no
real meaning of its own. "Kalyara,"
the title of this year's upcoming
show, is no exception: it's corrupted
and perhaps whitewashed enough
to be easily chanted and repeated
by most students, but just foreign-
sounding enough to fool audience
members into believing it's authentic
and meaningful.
It's a far cry from the IASA
shows of the 1990s, one of which
was authentically named "Satya" -
"truth" in Sanskrit. (The irony is suf-
focating.)
Moststudents across campus
- including Indian-American
students - have no idea that these
shows aren't titled meaningfully.
And that isn't really their fault. But
I believe that self-identified Indian
organizations have a responsibility
to remain faithful to certain aspects
of Indian culture. I believe that
anyone claiming to represent their
culture should make every effort to
portray itto the best oftheir abilities.
So why is it so compelling to rinse
Indian words of their meaning?
What does it mean when Indian

names are kneaded or chopped up
to be made more palatable to an
English-speaking audience? Who
should be held accountable for the
mainstream corruption of Indian
language and pronunciation in
Western settings?
And perhaps, most poignantly: is it
still called appropriationifit'sofyour
own culture?
A community cannot simultane-
ously strive to preserve its culture
while consciously erasing it. Indi-
an-Americans cannot claim to por-
tray something authentically while
replacing traditional Indian names
with disingenuous but sort-of-Indi-
an-sounding ones. We might pres-
ent the most traditional dancing or
the most traditional food or the most
traditional clothing, but our names -
the most visible, ubiquitous parts of
our identities - will betray us.
Throughout my childhood, my
parents always stressed the impor-
tance of saying Indian words cor-
rectly, of staying faithful to where
we came from no matter how
engulfed we became within main-
stream American culture. To this
day they have stayed true to their
convictions, never ever compromis-
ing a name or pronunciation for the
sake of ease or simplicity. They, like
many of my friends, have pushed
back against the forced assimilation
that is still all too prevalent in this
proclaimed melting pot of America,
retaining the fullness and richness
of the Indian names and words that
flow through their veins.
Because here's the thing about a
melting pot: although it initially con-
sists of many different ingredients,
the effect ofthe heat makes the differ-
ences ultimately indistinguishable.
Since reclaiming the true pronuncia-
tion of my own name, I have sought
to stay whole, a solid chunk floating
among the melted ones.
I may wear your clothes every
day and I may speak your language
every day. But when I am asked to
represent where I come from, where
my parents and their parents and
our traditions come from - I will
be myself. I will say the names of
my family, the names of my culture,
names that taste like sweet laddoos
in my mouth, names that color
the air with the bright orange of
saffron and sound like the music
of the veena, names and titles that
overflow with history and meaning
and are unapologetically Indian.
My names. Our names. Honest,
unabridged, and authentic.

REGAN DETWILER I
Tim Cook's equality for all

Last Thursday, the CEO of one of
the most powerful companies in the
world, Apple's Tim Cook, released an
editorial in Bloomberg Businessweek
publicly acknowledging his sexual
orientation as gay. His decision
to do this holds tremendous
weight, making him the only CEO
of a Fortune 500 company to be
openly gay, according to a video
accompanying the editorial on the
Businessweekwebsite.
In response, I'd like to address
the question of why Cook's public
acknowledgement of his sexual
orientation has to be such big news.
My answer? It doesn't.
Businessweek editor Josh
Tyrangiel said in the same video that,
"...itis news today. It is big news. But
[Cook's] hope and I think all of our
hope is that at some point, it doesn't
become news at all."
This is anexcellent point. The fight
for equality among people regardless
of sexual orientation has gone on
for too long. Cook was able to get to
where he is now, being the head of
one of the most influential companies
in the world, without ever having to
address his sexual orientation in the
professional world. When will we
finally be able to see that, ultimately,
in our day-to-day interactions with
people, sexual orientation doesn't
have to matter?
What really matters here is that a
person with international influence

is embarking on a highly public cam-
paign for equality among all groups,
not just people or varying sexual ori-
entations. Is the news that the CEO
of Apple is gay or that someone in
power is taking a personal and pro-
fessional risk inthe name of equality?
Most headlines surrounding the
essay will read something like The
Washington Post's "Apple CEO
publicly acknowledges that he's
gay," or New York Times' "Apple's
Tim Cook Says That He Is 'Proud to
Be Gay.'" But the headline from the
actual Businessweek editorial simply
reads, "Tim Cook Speaks Up," which
another Times article claimed "did
not address the news head on."
Cook's article reads that many of
hiscolleagues atAppleknowhe'sgay.
He says he's neither denied his sexual
orientation nor has never openly
acknowledged it. The fact that he's
gay isn't really news, but rather an
affirmation of something people have
supposed for a while.
The purpose of the essay seemed
to be more of a heartfelt campaign for
equality rooted in Cook's personal
experiences. He called not only
for equality regardless of sexual
orientation, but for equality for all
different groups, writing that he
"will personally continue to advocate
for equality for all people until my
toes point up." The editorial is just
as much about equality and fair
treatment of all people as it's about

equality for people of all different
sexual orientations. The news is
that someone who has the power of
international influence is speaking
up, which is exactly what the
headline reports in Businessweek. In
this way, they're doing a better job of -
addressing the news "head on" than
most other media outlets.
While Cook highlights that per-
sonal privacy is greatly important to
him, helping others trumps his own
individual wants. He wrote that "if
hearing that the CEO of Apple is
gay can help someone struggling to
come to terms with who he or she
is, or bring comfort to anyone who
feels alone or inspire people to insist
on their equality, then it's worth the
trade-off with my own privacy."
And this, I think, is the real
news. Someone in a position of
power is making a personal sacri-
fice, sharing personal information
and taking a personal and profes-
sional risk in the hopes of helping
spread equality among all groups of
people. But if there are people out
there who still insist that the most
important thing about Tim Cook's
essay is that he is "proud to be gay,"
then I'll borrow the words of Busi-
nessweek's editor and say regard-
less, that "truly, we should allbe
getting back to work."

of such an innovation, "Within"
employs a small but ingenious
scare tactic that most major
game review publications have
failed to commend - it messes
with you in the save rooms. In
"RE4," the "typewriter" rooms
in which you saved the game
were the one place that nothing
could harm you or scare you.
In fact, this is a trope in most
video games that utilize save
files - nothing can hurt you
in the save room. Devilishly,
"Within" predates upon
this established convention.
Without giving any spoilers,
know that Mikami's team has
devised some intelligent ways
to never let you feel truly safe
in this game.
While "Within" is clunky
and inconsistent in some areas,
the sick and twisted creativity
permeating every harrowing
situation is enough to make
those terrible boss fights
worth it. "Within" isn't nearly
as innovative as "RE4," nor as
mechanically sound, but it's
often just as fun and exciting.
It's a must-play for fans of the
survival horror genre, and a
beacon of difference in an era
where creativity in mainstream
video gaming is increasingly
hard to come by.

With every trek to the library,
mywalk is devoted to decidingthe
soundtrack to that day's study ses-
sion. Music is crucial in setting the
tone: Am I going to be productive
or spend most of my time bobbing
along to summer hits of the '90s?
Sitting down to browse through
my Pandora stations and, with
some luck, actually beginning to
work, I land on Beyonce radio.
Bey is usually reserved for estro-
gen-fueled gatherings, perfect for
empowerment, but not so great for
studying.
Feeling indulgent, I select the
station and let the first few songs
play. The mix is largely made up
of '90s and early '00s hits from
groupssuch as Destiny's Child and
TLC. I find myself becoming nos-
talgic for a time in which strong
all-girl groups ruled the radio. The
longing is not entirely legitimate
since I never got to really experi-
ence this era in the first place. For
example, I was only four years
old when "No Scrubs" came out,
and songs of this genre are almost
universally seen as classic throw-
backs, even if it technically means
throwing back to infancy for some.
There is something innately infec-
tious about this female-fueled
genre that is missing from today's
popular music scene.
While there is no denying
the positive impact of powerful
women in music today, the domi-
nance of girl groups has shifted
to that of powerfulasolo artists.
Names like Rihanna and-ironi-
cally, Beyonce have replaced these
older groups in favor of solo acts.

matter. The focus became less on
producing bouncy tracks that cel-
ebrated independence and more
on sexuality and, arguably, a high-
er dependence on men. Not to say
that these subject matters were
absent in popular hip hop of the
time (we all remember "Goodies")
but thatthey have become more of
a driving force behind sales and
popularity.
With that in mind, I propose a
return to the bumping female hip-
hop group. There is something far
more impactful and entertaining
about a group of women perform-
ing together rather than a solo diva
as the center of attention. Imagine
if Beyonce, Nicki Minaj and Alicia
Keys decided to band together to
create a super group - I think we
would all buy tickets to that show.
The perception of women would
shift back to one of a united front

ing in music today, and its absence
gives younger female audiences
theimpressionthattheonlywayto
be a strong women is to do it alone.
Aside from any social implica-
tions of girl groups is the fact that
their music is just plain fun. There
is a reason that songs like "Say My
Name" and "Jumpin', Jumpin'"
still get a reaction out of people.
Groups of the '90s and early 'OOs
took the best aspects of music at
the time and improved upon them.
The combination of R&B sound,
hip-hop beat, killer vocals and
feisty lyrics could result in noth-
ing less than timeless widespread
popularity. There is no denying
that it is hard to stop listening
once you start. Bringing back this
lost art form would once again fill
the airwaves with fabulous female
harmonies and soulful sounds of
another era.

Pop goddess partners
with Topshop for new
clothing label
By MARA MACLEAN
For The Daily
The opportunity to get
a piece of Beyonced's closet
has finally arrived, and
fashionistas and athletes
everywhere are trying not to
pass out. Last week Topshop
announced their 50-50
partnership with Bey to launch
a new label, Parkwood Topshop
Athletic Ltd., for 2015.
The line will include apparel
for dance, fitness and sports.
One assumes that while
Beyonce squats, curls and
presses she looks as fierce as-
the "On the Run" tour photos
suggest - and most women
would agree that they would
like to look like Sasha Fierce
while sweating as well. The
sportswear . collection will.
do just that, even if one lacks
Beyonce's famous figure.
Sportswear and streetwear
collaborations have had
unparalleled success, as
of late. Alexander Wang's

collaboration with H&M hit
stores Nov. 6, and images of
structural sports bras and
mesh-paneled leggings have
been haunting fashionistas
ever since the show. Both Rita
Ora and Pharrell Williams
have created colorful lines
with Adidas to fulfill the ever-
growing need for funky and
vibrant streetwear choices. All
three of these lines, though,
while undoubtedly stylish,
lack the necessary technical
elements to allow a full range
of movement. Topshop and
Beyonce hope to produce a
line that allows for an athlete's
workout and a Beyonce look.
As many college women can
attest, while athletic wear is
comfortable, yoga pants lack a
certain aesthetic quality. But
with this new partnership,
campus leggings are about to
undergo a transformation. No
longer will students be limited
to the typical threadbare black
leggings or even the pervasive
lulus. Instead, they can be
comfortable in class and at
the gym, while simultaneously
emulating Beyonce. It's a
dream come true, goddammit.
This line is different than
a typical collaboration. Bey,

as per usual, would not be
satisfied with a collection that
her name was just slapped
onto. The brand is a 50-50
partnership, and Beyonce is to
participate in every phase and
looks forward to working with
the product development team.
After the West family was
recently crowned the First
Family of Fashion, Queen Bey's
new venture was appropriately
timed. She is not one to settle
for second place and her
infiltration of the stylish
athletic wear arena will make
her a contender for the top
spot. Beyonce recognized
that active wear is the biggest
thing in fashion right now, and
intelligently joined the contest.
Seeing as most women
would like to have legs similar
to Beyoncd's, the partnership
was a brilliant choice by both
parties. Beyonce continues
to fiercely empower women,
now entering into the world
of health and fitness - she
expresses that one can look.
stylish while keeping the body
strong. The wait begins for the
day when women everywhere
will be sporting Beyonce
approved leggings while
squatting to "Flawless."

heft is wielded by Francis
McDormand ("Fargo") as the
thorny Olive Kitteridge. Beneath
the seemingly impenetrable
facade of her character,
McDormand furnishes the
psychic interior of Olive with
meticulous facial expressions
andline delivery. The strong cast
also includes Richard Jenkins
("Six Feet Under") as Henry
and a late-in-life love interest by
Bill Murray ("Groundhog Day"),
who both deliver captivating
performances.
The show introduces Olive
as barbed Maine schoolteacher
who has a knack for pissing
people off - at a family dinner,
she calls her son Christopher's
(Devin Druid, "Louie" & John
Gallagher Jr., "Jonah Hex")
homework "lazy, slapdash crap,"
before turning to Henry to say
"Jim O'Casey understands your
son's abilities more than you
do." What it makes it cruel isn't
Olive's maliciousness (she has
none) but the careless quality
of her barbs - which stick -
because more often than not,
they're true.
For all her abuse, Henry is
the rose to olive's thorn, even
if his unfailing deference and
kindness is perpetually cloying
to her. While their marriage
miraculously remains one of
steadfast devotion, itisn't placid.
Early on, Olive is emotionally
involved with a fellow teacher
with her same acerbic tongue
(Peter Mullan,"Trainspotting"),
and 'Henry lusts after a young
employee in his pharmacy
played by Zoe Kazan ("Ruby
Sparks"). Years later, Olive will
bitterly snap at his soft spot for
helpless "mice" (her catch-all
term for dull, anodyne women)
and he will taunt her of her not
quite dalliance. Regardless,
their marriage is a contractual
and voluntary lifetime bond, for
better or for worse, and "Olive
Kitteridge" grapples with the
implications of that dynamic.
As Olive marvels to Henry, "You
married a beast and loved her."
Olive isn't a beast, but she is a
wholly different type of woman
- or person. She constantly
misses socialcues, ifnotoutright
ignores them. Olive burps
without apology, noisily eats
peanuts during Christopher's
wedding and doesn't see the
point of keeping a Valentine's
Day card after she reads it. If the

first episode emphasizes Olive's
many alienating flaws, the other
three illuminate the isolation of
being someone like Olive.
One of the most compelling
aspects of Olive's personality
is how despite her failings as
a mother, she has an intuitive
kindness for other alienated
sons, like a student of hers
with a bipolar mother who she
saves years later from a suicide
attempt. During a scene where
she's held hostage, Olive sees the
acne-ridden face of her captor
and maternally reminds him not
to pick his scars. It seems the
parentless and the clinically lost
strike a personal nerve for Olive,
whose own dark childhood is
hinted at.
As the years unfold,
intergenerational fate becomes
a theme: is Olive's depression
a genetic curse or was it
hammered into her by her own
flawed parents as she does to
Christopher? Mental illness is
not the overt focus of the series,
but its-ahadow looms, After all,
there is something wrong about
Olive to the therapeutically
trained eye of the modern
viewer. She is caustic and
harsh to those she loves -
today we would recognize
that irritability as symptom
of faulty neurological wiring;
there would SSRIs or cognitive
behavioral therapy. But in
Olive's world, mental illness
is endured. It's something of
a catharsis for the viewer to
see Christopher later embrace
therapy and medication. The
series doesn't deliver Olive an
artificial happiness via deus
es machina; it shows a woman
changing, and also not changing
quite enough - this is what
makes "Olive Kitteridge" so
heartrending.
Both uncomfortably familiar
and strange, Olive has a knack
for getting under the viewer's
skin. Usually the adjectives
"difficult" and "interesting"
connote a whole knot of
gendered behavior that the
female protagonist has not
conformed to. Indeed, even
as a proclaimed feminist, it's
challenging to tease out the
exact reasons Olive Kitteridge
simultaneously jars and
interests me. And this is exactly
why the complex, knotty "Olive
Kitteridge" is such a welcome
presence on TV.

Berenson recalls six-goal game

By JEREMY SUMMITT
DailySportsEditor
After Monday's practice at
Yost Ice Arena, Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson was the last
one off the ice.
The long-time coach was busy
working with freshman forward
Dylan Larkin on his backhand
shot near the crease. In a quick,
fluid motion from his forehand
to backhand, Berenson roofed
nearly every shot he took. Larkin
couldn't help but smirk a few
times.
The ice might have been clear
of defensemen and the net was
empty, but even at 74 years old,
Berenson still has a knack for
scoring goals.
Friday marks the 46th
anniversary of one of the
greatest scoring feats in the
history of the NHL. On Nov. 7,
1968, Berenson scored six goals
against the Philadelphia Flyers,
pacing the St. Louis Blues to an
8-0 victory.
Legendary coach Scotty
Bowman - the St. Louis coach
at the time - kept sending
Berenson out for more shifts
in the winding moments of the
game. Despite being one goal
away from an NHL record,
Berenson would have felt
comfortable on the bench.
"I didn't want to go out
and cost our team a shutout,"
Berenson said. "He probably
knew this was a record-setting
occasion. I didn't know. I had no
idea. I just knew I was having
a good game and the puck was
going in."
Berenson netted his first goal
of the game at the 16:42 mark of
the first period.
"When I scored the first goal
I said, 'Thank God I can still
score' to myself," Berenson said.
The rest came in a flurry. Four
second-period goals all within
nine minutes of each other
sparked the Philadelphia fans

With just under six minutes
left in the game, he lined a

Michigan runs away from Rutgers

By CHLOEAI
Daily Sport

UBUCHON
s Writer

The Michigan field hockey
team is exactly where it wants
to be for this year's Big Ten
Tournament.
Seeded second, the
12th-ranked Wolverines opened
postseason play with a 3-0 win
over seventh-seeded Rutgers
(2-6 Big Ten, 9-10 overall) at
Ocker Field Thursday as they
play host to the Big Ten's top-
eight teams this weekend.
The $13.5-million
renovations to the field have
made it a prime location for
the event. The state-of-the-
art complex
includes a
1,500-seat "We ha
grandstand, a
high-definition of empo
video board,
training and
physical
therapy equipment, and vibrant
blue artificial turf, among other
amenities.
But for Michigan (6-2,
13-6), hosting the Big Ten
Tournament is about far more
than the chance to show off
a facility that is garnering
national attention in the field
hockey world. It's about having
the home-field advantage for
the third time ever, and the first
time since 2006.
Michigan is 8-3 at home,
including four straight wins
after the new Ocker Field's
inaugural game and a win over
then-No. 9 Northwestern.
"To be at our 'smurf turf' is
such an honor," said fifth-year
senior back Leslie Smith. "My
friends and family are all here
to see and watch. And I think
it's the same for everyone. Just
being on our field, we have a
sense of empowerment."
That sense of empowerment
served the Wolverines well
in their quarterfinal game,
despite a scoring stalemate in

the first half. The team shut
out the Scarlet Knights and
scored three goals - including
a well-executed corner and
a penalty stroke by Smith
and a breakaway tally from
sophomore attacker Courtney
Enge.
With single-elimination
games leaving little time to
prepare, Michigan entered the
tournament only focusing on
Thursday's game.
"We've played everybody
already, so generally we have
an idea about what everyone's
styles are like and what their
tactics are like," said Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz. "So,
you can only
focus on the
ye a sense first game,
and that's
werment." really all you
can focus
on."
The
preparation paid off, as
Michigan played some of its
cleanest field- hockey of the
season. After a disappointing
loss to Michigan State and a
sloppy win over Ohio State to
close out the regular season,
the Wolverines set a new tone
for the tournament with clean
passes, strong defensive play
and good field transitions using
open players.
With a convincing win
on its home turf, Michigan's
momentum is at an all-time
high as it seeks to continue its
success on the field that has
treated it so well this season.
"(Thursday) helped the team
with some confidence," Pankratz
said. "I think our backfield will
stay steady and hopefully do
the same thing they did today.
And hopefully we can build off
some corner execution from the
second half today and be able to
do that (Friday)."
Playing at the new Ocker
Field will only help the
Wolverines' cause.

sophomore
forward Courtney Enge finally
made the Scarlet Knights pay.
With 9:33 left in the second
half, Enge stole the ball from
a Rutgers defender and raced
down the field on a breakaway
before sliding the ball past the
upright goaltender into the back
of the net.
The goal, Enge's first of the
game, made the score 3-0. The
score held, and the Wolverines
(6-2 Big Ten, 13-6 overall)
advanced to the quarterfinals of
the Big Ten Tournament.
Michigan, playing in the
friendly confines of Ocker Field,
commanded the gameplay from
the start, but that didn't translate
tothescoreboarduntilthesecond

minutes to find the back of the
net, and until then, the Scarlet
Knights did what underdogs
often do - played sound defense
and frustrated the opposition.
Rutgers (9-10, 2-6), playing
to extend its season, gave up
few quality chances through
the first half and largely kept
the Michigan offense in check.
However, the Wolverines
remained patient with the ball
and were eventually rewarded,
breaking through early in the
second half and never looking
back.
Senior back Leslie Smith
struck first, converting the
Wolverines' ninth corner of the
game off a pass from freshman

Thursday's win gives Michigan

needed momentum for a team
that tied for second during Big

"I think (the win) helps the
team with confidence," Pankratz

Wolverines prep for Wildcats

FOOTBALL
Breakdown:'M'
will ride defense

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
You probably don't remember
the first 59:50 of the Michigan
football team's game against
Northwestern last year.
But you likely haven't
forgotten the last 10 seconds.
You remember former wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon catching
the ball at the 27-yard line, and
the offense on the field sprinting
off. And then Michigan coach
Brady Hoke waving his field-
goal unit on. All before the
line got set, holder Drew
Dileo sliding to hold the ball,
and kicker Brendan Gibbons
connecting from 44 yards out.
There were three overtimes
following that period, but you
probably don't remember how
those played out, save for the
fact that Michigan won.
You probably ' don't
remember the first 59:42 of the
Wolverines' game against the
Wildcats in 2012.
But you probably remember
former wide receiver Roy
Roundtree leaping up to tip a
heave from Devin Gardner and
somehow hanging onto the ball
with one hand as it dropped.
Though you likely don't know
howthatovertime periodplayed
out, you do remember Michigan
walking away victorious.
"It just really reminds you
that all of the little things
matter," Hoke said at his
Wednesday press conference.
In both instances, you
remember the Wolverines' grit
and the way they fought back
even though they trailed. And
against Northwestern (2-3 Big
Ten, 3-5 overall) this year, it's
going to take that same effort
for Michigan (2-3, 4-5) to make
something of its season by
reaching a bowl game.
That type of play will be
all the more important as the
Wolverines head to Evanston
again, needing two wins to
be bowl eligible. Fortunately,

Fifth-year senior quarterback Devin Gardner passed for more than 200 yards for the first time all season last Saturday.

Michigan will enter with
momentum after trouncing
Indiana, while the Wildcats
enter after a heartbreaking,
last-minute loss to Wisconsin.
The Wolverines are winless
on the road this season and
are 4-9 on the road in the past
three years under Hoke. But in
Evanston, Michigan could have
a home-like advantage because
of the large alumni base in
Chicago.
You won't remember whether
they played on the road or at
home, though, because you'll
probably remember whether
the Wolverines' offense does or
doesn't perform well. They'll
need to replicate Saturday's
performance against the
Hoosiers, in which they put up
220 yards passing and nearly 150
yards rushing. And they'll need
to do so without committing
some of the same mistakes

they've made all year long.
"I think the biggest thing
we're going to do differently is
take care of the football," Hoke
said Wednesday. "Because
when you look at it, I think
we're minus-11 turnover margin
on the road this year. That
doesn't help.
"I think the familiarity with
going back there (helps). We
understand the locker room,
how to take the field."
Northwestern's defense
ranks ninth in the Big Ten in
scoring, allowing an average of
23.4 points per game, which will
help a Michigan offense that
has scored more than 25 points
only once in conference play.
Fortunately, the Wolverines
can ride the strong play of
redshirt sophomore running
back Drake Johnson, who was
the first Michigan back to rush
for more than 100 yards in a

game since sophomore Derrick
Green did against Miami (Ohio)
on Sept. 13. But that doesn't
mean he'll start or see an
increased share of the carries
over sophomore De'Veon Smith.
You probably don't remember
the Wildcats' offense from last
year, the one that relied on
former running back Venric
Mark, and you likely won't
remember how their offense
is now led by quarterback
Trevor Siemian. But this year,
Northwestern will lean on a
balanced offense, rather than
the one that has been skewed
toward the ground game in
recent years.
Ultimately, you won't
remember the offense or
defense from Saturday's game.
Instead, you'll remember the
defining moments that happen
at the end of the game in a
season that hasn't had many.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
DailySportsEditor
The Michigan football team's
next stop on its path to a potential
bowl game lies in Evanston,
where it will face Northwestern
on Saturday.
Last year's matchup was a
triple-overtimeslogthatendedin
the Wolverines' favor. The result
isarguablyMichigancoachBrady
Hoke's most notable road win
during his tenure in Ann Arbor.
And while the Wolverines are
winless on the road this season,
their best chance for a win
away from Michigan Stadium
comes this weekend against the
struggling Wildcats.
Here's a breakdown of
Michigan's meeting with
Northwestern.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Northwestern pass defense
Against Indiana last week,
fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner exceeded 200
yards passing for the first time
all season. But like Michigan, the
Wildcats rely on their defense,
which has forced 14 turnovers
and 14 sacks, and has allowed an
average of 23.9 points per game.
Northwestern (2-3 Big Ten, 3-
overall) has won 10 of its last 14
games when it holds teams to
fewer than 25 points.
That being said, Michigan
(2-3, 4-5) should be able to
move the ball, as Northwestern
allows an average of 388.4 yards
per game. Redshirt sophomore
receiver Amara Darboh, coming
off of a career-high 107-yard
performance last week, will need
to get involved early alongside
junior receiver Devin Funchess.
The pair can spread the
coverage and give Gardner two
big targets. So, this matchup
lies on Gardner, who has
struggled mightily on the road
this'season and has thrown 11
tstal interceptionsand just six
touchdowns this year. That
will need to change if Michigan
wants to win.
Edge: Push
Michigansrush offense vs.
Northwestern rush defense
Redshirt sophomore Drake
Johnson stormed onto the scene
last week with a 122-yard, two-
touchdown performance. But
Hoke maintained a tight-lipped
approach whennamingastarting
running back for this week. So
look for it to be some combination
of Johnson's elusive speed and
sophomore De'Veon Smith's
power-running abilities to keep
Northwestern's defensive line on
its toes.
The Wildcats are allowing
an average of 166 yards on the
ground, so expect Michigan to
take advantage. Northwestern's
biggest defensive threat is
linebacker Chi Chi Ariguzo, who
is eighth in the conference in
tackles.
Edge: Michigan

Michiganpass defense
The Wildcats are coming off
their worst passing performance
of the season. Last week, Iowa
held quarterback Trevor Siemian
to 8-of-18 passing for 68 yards
and no touchdowns. Over the last
threegames,Siemianhasjust two
total touchdowns and two picks.
Northwestern could be without
starting receiver Dan Vital -
who is questionable with a foot
injury - so its passing offense
should continue its struggles.
In Michigan's secondary,
freshman corner Jabrill Peppers
is officially out for the rest of
the season, but the Wildcats
are averaging just 19 points per
game - last in the conference.
And while the Wolverines are
second-to-last in the Big Ten in
pass defense efficiency, starting
corners senior Raymon Taylor,
redshirt junior Blake Countess
and sophomore Jourdan Lewis
should be able to take care of
business.
Edge: Michigan
Northwestern rush offense vs.
Michiganrsshdefense
Michigan ranks ninth in the
nation in total defense with
its crown jewel being its run
stopping. And with the Wildcat
offense struggling through the
air, the Wolverines' ability to
limit yards on the ground will

Northwestern running back

726 yards and five touchdowns
on the season. Northwesten has
won 9-of-11 games when rushing
for at least one touchdown. But
the Wildcats average just 3.2
yards per carry, so their ground
game also leaves much to be
desired.
Edge: Michigan
Specialteams
Northwestern is second in the
BigTeninpuntreturns;aveaging
14 yrds per opportunity. ut on
the other side of its punting unit,
the Wildcats rank dead last in
the conference in net yards per
punt. Michigan's kicking game
has improved significantly since
early-season struggles, and the
team has full confidence in senior
kicker Matt Wile should it come
down to a field goal.
Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
After a strong start to the
Big Ten season, Northwestern
has struggled badly as of late
and would need to win out to
be bowl eligible. Michigan is
coming off its most balanced
performance of the season, so
look for the Wolverines to carry
that momentum, but they'll need
to overcome their road troubles.
And while this is a home game for
the Wildcats, Michigan fans have
a big following in Chicago and
often fill the stadium with more
maize andblue than purple.

The Daily sat down with
Campbell at Big Ten Media Day
in July.
The Michigan Daily: How

TMD: The Michigan game
specifically last year, has that
served as a motivator? Was that
loss particularly painful with
how it went down in the end
there?
IC: We had a couple tough
losses last year. I don't think one
hurt any more than the other.
Losing a game, losing sucks, bot-
tomline. Whether we lost in that
fashion or whether we lost by a
landslide, no one likes to lose.
Every time we lose a game, we
take something from it, just like

play?
IC: It was a lot happening at
once. I don't necessarily remem-
ber watching that Dileo dive or
anything like that. I remember
seeing that on film and think-
ing back to it. I mean, but at the
moment, honestly, I was kind
of trying to figure out what was
going on because it was like guys
were running on and off the
field, I actually thought we had
too many guys on the field, so I
didn't even realize that they, I
mean, it was a lot.

Campbell
TMD: I see you smiling, kind
of rolling your eyes. Is it still
tough to comprehend that all of
that happened?
IC: Like I said, losing sucks,
it's never fun. I'm just smiling,
because thinking back to it, I
really don't know. Like, it was
just so chaotic those last couple
seconds that it's hard to kind of
put it into words, because I don't
really know. Yeah, I don't know.
TMD: With all of those close
losses last year, does it almost
make you feel good that there is
no way some of that crazy stuff
could happen?
IC: I think if anything, we've
realized that those crazy things
can happen multiple times. And
they happened to us. So, the fact
that they happened makes me
feel no more comfortable that
they won't happen again because
they happened over and over
again last season.
