ACADEMICS

Getting good grades, having 

the best teachers and applying 
to college are all integral parts 
of one’s education. But for 
students of color, many of these 
aspirations cannot be met due 
to structural racism and the 
broken pipeline within our 
educational system.

Nikole 
Hannah-Jones, 
a 

New York Times investigative 
journalist and 2017 MacArthur 
“Genius”, came to the University 
of Michigan’s Institute of Social 
Research Wednesday to discuss 
educational 
segregation 
and 

racial inequities.

Jones 
opened 
the 

conversation 
by 
discussing 

the prevalence of segregation 
within the public education 
system and why the system 
continues to be propagated.

“Segregation has produced 

benefit for white Americans and 
harm for Black Americans,” she 
said.

Jones cited statistics that 

compared schools with a white 
majority 
and 
schools 
with 

students-of-color 
majority. 

Universities 
were 
not 
an 

exception 
to 
the 
presented 

inequality.

“The share of Black freshmen 

at elite schools is virtually 
unchanged since 1980,” Jones 
said. 
“Black 
students 
are 

just 6 percent of freshmen 
but 15 percent of college-age 
Americans.”

Jones continued to explain 

those in positions of privilege 
often 
believe 
they 
are 

fighting for equality, but do 
not acknowledge their own 
hypocrisy in separating their 
children by sending them to 
schools that have extremely 
small populations of students of 
color.

“We cannot say we want equal 

opportunity for all children 
then fight for the advantages of 
our own children,” she said.

Jones also spoke about her 

personal conflict when deciding 
whether to send her daughter to 
a predominately white school

TAL LIPKIN
For the Daily

Event held by University History Department intended to disrupt injustices

On Wednesday evening, the 

University of Michigan History 
Department 
held 
a 
teach-in 

surrounding “Disrupting White 
Supremacy: 
Global 
Histories 

and Local Struggles.” The talk 
included 12 speakers in an effort 
to reclaim and retell the history 
of race in the U.S. and globally. 
The speeches were followed 
by a student “talk back” panel, 
focusing 
on 
the 
historical 

injustices and their inaccurate 
recordings that have shaped our 
current political climate. 

Views could follow the talk on 

twitter and pose questions to the 
speakers using the #UMDisrupt.

Teach-ins have a long and 

storied history at the University. 
The nation’s first “teach-in” took 
place on campus in March of 1965 
with 3,000 students gathering 
across rooms in Angell Hall to 
discuss and protest the war in 
Vietnam. 

Rackham 
student 
Tara 

Weinberg explained the urgency 

to come to events like this, 
especially with the controversy 
surrounding white supremacist 
Richard Spencer’s potential visit 
to campus next semester.

“I think it’s really important 

to counter him because if there 
is no counter, then it’s almost 
taken as a given that he’s been 
received with silence and with 
complicity,” Weinberg said.

Several professors and one 

graduate student spoke on how the 
current political climate has been 
shaped from an international, 
historical 
perspective. 

Katherine French, a J. Frederick 
Hoffman professor of history, 
accompanied 
by 
Rackham 

student Taylor Sims identified 
medieval 
fantastical 
symbols 

used by white supremacists in 
the Charlottesville protests, and 
how their modern use incorrectly 
represents the Crusades at large. 
This misrepresentation has given 
white supremacists an empty 
sense of security and support, 
and 
has 
misconstrued 
their 

presence to the public.

Daily Staff Reporter

On Feb. 12, Detroit workers 

left their jobs and gathered 
in Martin Luther King Jr. 
Memorial Park to protest for a 
$15 statewide minimum wage. 
Linked to the 50th anniversary 
of the 1968 Memphis sanitation 
worker strike, where workers 
walked away from their jobs 
to protest inadequate pay and 
dangerous working conditions, 
similar protests were held in 
other major cities including 
Chicago, 
Houston 
and 

Cleveland.

The movement responsible 

for this, Fight for $15, aims to 
raise the minimum wage to 
$15 and was created when New 
York City fast-food workers 
led a strike for higher wages 
in 2012. Since then, California, 
New York and Washington 
D.C. have crafted incremental 
plans to reach a $15 minimum 
wage in the coming years, while 
Seattle already implemented 
a $15 minimum wage for large 
employers this year.

Despite these large national 

movements, however, public 
opinionis still largely split on 
whether a $15 minimum wage is 
a good idea.

Charles 
Brown, 
an 

economics professor at the 
University of Michigan, worked 
on the Minimum Wage Study 
Commission from 1979 to 1981 
and published several related 
papers in the following decades. 

While the $15 minimum wage 
has been approved in several 
notable cities and states, Brown 
said he views Detroit as a 
different case.

“As a group , these wages are 

in more prosperous areas than 
Detroit,” Brown said. 

Though Detroit is a large city, 

its economy lags behind Seattle 
or San Francisco according to 
the speakers. Wallace Hopp, 
a professor of business and 
engineering, said the prevailing 

wage rate should be considered 
when adopting a new state 
minimum 
wage. 
Michigan 

just raised its minimum wage 
from $8.90 to $9.25 on Jan. 1, 
the last step of an incremental 
minimum 
wage 
increase 

plan enacted in 2014. When 
Seattle began its incremental 
minimum wage raise to $15 
in 2015, its large employers’ 
minimum wage was $11, and its 
small employers with medical 
benefits’ minimum wage was 

$10. 

“In some cities, like Seattle, 

with hot labor markets, low-
wage jobs were much closer to 
$15 per hour than in less hot 
labor markets like Detroit,” 
Hopp said. “So the ability of a 
Seattle to absorb an increase 
to $15 per hour is much greater 
than that of Detroit. Of course, 
the cost of living is also lower 
in Detroit than Seattle. So the 
minimum wage does not need to

Lindsay Haas, an MDining 

Culinary and Nutrition Support 
Specialist, met with University 
of Michigan students last year 
to listen to their concerns over 
the lack of healthy beverage 
options 
at 
the 
residential 

dining halls. After considering 
their feedback, Haas decided 
to test a new healthy beverage 
dispensary machine called Bevi.

A Bevi machine, which offers 

students the choice of either still 
or sparkling water with four 
different flavor options, will 
be installed in the South Quad 
residential dining hall on Feb. 
26, as part of a two-month trial 
period.

Haas found many students 

were looking for a way to 
customize their drinks. Bevi 
gives 
students 
control 
over 

how much flavor goes into their 
drink, with possible options 
ranging from lemon lime to 
blueberry cucumber. All flavors 
are zero calories, unsweetened 
or naturally sweetened. The 
machine functions through a 
touch-screen, and ingredient

CSG party profiles: Meet True Blue, 
Arathi Sabada and Marriane Drysdale

In run-up to March elections, party platform calls for more safe and accessible campus

What are your plans for 
spring break?

“Go back home 
and then fill out 
FAFSA and worry 
about exams 
that are going to 
happen after the 
break.”

LSA sophomore David 
Geering

As students gear up for 

the University of Michigan’s 
Central Student Government 
elections on March 21 and 
22, The Daily sat down with 
executive candidates to talk 
platforms, vision, and plans. In 
this installment, we profile the 
True Blue party, headlined by 
presidential candidate Arathi 
Sabada and vice presidential 
candidate Marianne Drysdale.

Business 
junior 
Arathi 

Sabada, True Blue’s presidential 
candidate, got involved with 

Central Student Government 
almost as soon as she stepped 
onto campus her freshman year. 
She decided it was time to run 
for president after seeing the 
importance of engaging with the 
student body.

“I got involved with CSG my 

first semester freshman year so it 
was a very new experience, and I 
had so many incredible mentors, 
and it gave me an amazing 
platform to work on issues I saw 
on campus,” Sabada said. “When 
I was going through tough times, 
CSG really helped me in terms of 
programs that it had, so seeing 
what the platform did for me 
and seeing what it could do for 

other students in terms of the 
work (was important). I did a lot 
of work in terms of supporting 
student 
organizations 
with 

food 
insecurity 
on 
campus 

and seeing how powerful the 
platform was, and feeling like I 
had the experience to lead that 
organization is what inspired 
me to run. I also just really love 
engaging with different student 
organizations and talking to 
students on the Diag in my role as 
a former executive member, and 
working on a couple campaigns, 
that was something I was really 
looking forward to doing and 
inspired me to run.”

LSA sophomore Marianne 

Drysdale, True Blue’s vice 
presidential candidate, said 
she felt like CSG was her 
first real community on 
campus, and felt compelled 
to run this semester after 
thinking about the impact 
the body has had on her own 
experience.

“When I came to campus 

as a freshman, I knew that I 
wanted to get involved but I 
had no idea what I wanted 
to get involved in so I was 
definitely the kid at Festifall 
talking 
to 
every 
single 

booth,” Drysdale said. “I 
spent first semester feeling 
like really involved, but 
spending a lot of hours doing 
a lot of nothing, I felt like I 
wasn’t involved in anything 
that was really a tight-knit 
community. So when I ran on 
the campaign for CSG it was 
like the first moment where 
I was like, ‘Woah,’ I feel 
like I’m touching this really 
important work … Right now 
I’m a (CSG) chair position 
for communications, which 
is a lot of making sure 
students are engaging in 

student government and student 
government is engaging with 
students, which is a lot of what 
an executive position is. I also 
knew Arathi through working 
on the campaign last year, 
and when I found out she was 
running I was really excited 
to work on her campaign in 
whatever capacity possible and 
then the opportunity presented 
itself to be VP, and I took a 
minute to think about it and I 
thought, ‘You know, this is really 
something I could see myself 
doing and liking’ so it was totally 
unexpected.”

Sabada said one of her party’s 

main policy points has to do 
with food insecurity. She is also 
committed to improving overall 
student experience.

“There’s not a lot of grocery 

stores in the area. It’s really 
hard to have access to healthy 
and affordable food and I think 
there’s so many great orgs who 
are doing so much amazing work 
on campus, from Maize and Blue 
Cupboard to the Food Insecurity 
Taskforce, (and) I think CSG 
would be a really great way to 
scale up that work,” she said. 
“One thing that I’m really 
excited 
about 
is 
potentially 

hosting a pop-up grocery store 
in partnership with a local 
grocery store where they could 
come to campus and students 
could purchase that fresh and 
affordable produce as a shorter 
term initiative, and definitely 
working towards a longer-term 
initiative — eventually opening 
up a grocery store on campus 
where students can buy that 
healthy and affordable food, is 
something we’re really excited

people can’t give it back to you 
in the wrong form,” French 
said.

Lecturer 
Anne 
Berg 

explained how the Nazi party 
used 
fabricated 
scientific 

claims 
to 
promote 
and 

encourage racism in Germany 
and compared this to the 
current eugenics argument. 
In this respect, she admitted 
society 
today 
is 
not 
too 

different from Nazi Germany.

This 
past 
fall, 
protests 

broke out across campus as 
students groups called on the 
University to change the name 
of C.C. Little building and bus 
stop, as their namesake was a 
former University president 
and President of the American 
Eugenics Society. 

“Nazis were lucky that they 

had so much of a rich history of 
scientific evidence and visual 
legacies to draw on to build a 
racial state that thankfully has 
not yet been paralleled,” Berg 
said.

Associate professor Rudolph 

“Butch” 
Ware 
highlighted 

the roots of racism from an 

Islamic perspective in 18th 
century Africa. Despite the 
fact literacy rates were higher 
in regions of Africa than in 
any part of Europe, African 
people were nonetheless seen 
as slaves. Ware cited classical 
Islamic teachings that racism 
stems from pride, and urged 
the audience to set their pride 
aside and engage in dialogue 
to 
understand 
how 
white 

supremacy has occurred and 
what it has done.

Several 
speakers 
also 

focused 
on 
the 
historical 

inaccuracies from a national 
perspective. 

Assistant professor Matthew 

Spooner referenced the Haitian 
revolution and Rebecca J. Scott, 
a Charles Gibson Distinguished 
University professor of history, 
discussed the Reconstruction-
era government of Louisiana to 
highlight the lack of historical 
knowledge many hold, and how 
this ignorance warps views of 
current social problems.

“If we can’t understand the 

past, we will be blind to the 
present,” Spooner said.

information can be found on 
the panel.

According to Elliott Rains, 

the 
MDining 
Marketing 

Coordinator, students wanted 
something 
that 
wasn’t 

necessarily water, other than 
soft drinks.

“We want a good middle 

ground that will satisfy people, 
fit the need of students and is 
also health conscious,” he said.

The University is joining 

in a national movement as 
more Americans are ditching 
sugary drinks for healthier 
alternatives, according to the 
Huffington Post.

“We’ve realized that sugary 

beverages aren’t the way to 
go, but we still like things 
carbonated,” Dana Ferrante, 
Bevi’s 
marketing 
content 

writer said. “So this sparkling 
water trend or unsweetened 
flavored water is definitely in 

right now.”

The healthy drink craze is 

not the only trend Bevi pursues. 
The company also prides itself 
on being ecologically friendly, 
as they reported having saved 
15 million plastic bottles in 
2017.

Business sophomore Victor 

Mahdavi interned at a start-up 
in Cambridge, Mass. that used 
a Bevi machine.

“Some of the appeal was … 

not having to bring a plastic 
water bottle, which would lead 
to waste,” said Mahdavi. “(The 
machine) looks really cool. It 
would add some tech-savviness 
to the dining hall.”

MDining will be gauging 

students’ 
reaction 
to 
Bevi 

with comment cards near the 
machine.

“We’re looking for student 

feedback,” 
said 
Haas. 
“If 

there’s a lot interest from 
students across campus, then 
we would consider keeping it 
and bringing Bevi into more 
locations next fall.”

Mayor Christopher Taylor participates in a conversation with students about public policy in Weill Hall Wednesday. 

M AYOR TAYLOR ON POLICY

Pan wants to analyze the 

effects of genetic mutations on 
obesity, specifically in children, 
in search of ways to reverse it. He 
will be conducting the bulk of his 
experiments on mice to model the 
potential in humans. Though he 
cannot specify the details of the 
study, Pan noted England has a 
large database of sequenced DNA 
from morbidly obese children that 
he will be using in his research.

“I will be using that database 

and going after some of those 
genes to figure out what those 
genes are doing and whether 
we can reverse it and see if mice 
with this mutation can be cured 
with a drug or virus or some 
other treatment,” Pan said. “I 
hope to better understand the 
interface between human disease 
and basic science research to use 
translational research to create 
new therapies for human disease.”

Martin Myers, professor of 

internal medicine and molecular 
& integrative physiology, acted 
as Pan’s doctorate adviser and 
scientific mentor at the University. 
Myers helped train Pan as a 
scientist and worked with him 

throughout his research.

“As his PhD mentor, I know 

how 
smart, 
energetic, 
and 

talented 
Warren 
is,” 
Myers 

wrote in an email interview. 
“Not only does he deserve the 
award because of his talent and 
accomplishments, but also he 
will use the opportunity to learn 
more about translating his basic 
research expertise to the study of 
human disease. He defines what it 
means to be a self-starter!”

The 
Gates 
Cambridge 

Scholarship is given to students 
with high academic ability and 
the dedication to making the 
world a better place, according to

Scholarship 
is 
looking 
at 

leadership 
potential 
and 

demonstrated 
commitment 
to 

improving to the lives of others,” 
Dyson said. “Warren’s research 
in obesity genetics is an obvious 
fit for that, he is an exceptionally 
well qualified applicant.”

Garth

to prepare and apply for the

Strohbehn said. “He’s obviously 
a talented person who’s worked 
exceptionally 
hard 
for 
this 

opportunity –– it’s great to see 
it paying off in this way. It’s 
a really cool step forward for 
his research and for him as a 
developing 
intellectual. 
The 

Gates community is an incredible, 
multidisciplinary 
one 
full 
of 

brilliant people and so he’s going 
to develop even more as a thinker. 
It’s going to be an incredible 
experience.”

Yiran Liu, winner of the 

inaugural 
Knight-Hennessy 

Scholarship, 
graduated 
from 

the University in 2017 with a 
bachelor’s degree in cellular and 
molecular biology. Yiran hopes 
to obtain a doctorate in cancer 
biology but has a diverse range of 
research experiences and an open 
mind. 

“It’s really a huge honor to 

receive this scholarship,” Liu 
said. “I was not expecting at all 
so it’s very humbling to feel that 
I have the opportunity to become 
part of this community. When I 
went to the immersion weekend, 
I met so many people. These 
people were so grounded, kind, 
compassionate and empathetic 
and their work was driven by 
some kind of passion or need 

to make a difference in the 
community and the world and it 
is an honor to imagine myself in 
that community in grad school.”

According to Dyson, Knight-

Hennessy is the newest of the 
major scholarships, comparable 
to the Rhodes, Marshall and Gates 
Cambridge. He categorized this is 
a truly global scholarship with a 
49-student cohort, and 63 percent 
of 
which 
are 
international, 

according to a Knight-Hennessy 
press release. Dyson said Knight-
Hennessy 
understands 
the 

solutions to today’s problems 
are multi-disciplinary, thus the 
scholarship is offered to those 
pursuing a law, medical, doctorate 
and a multitude of other degrees.

“What I think makes Yiran 

really stand out as a candidate 
is 
that 
she 
is 
exceptionally 

well qualified in terms of her 
research credentials. She really 
is as good as any biomedical or 
STEM researcher and I think she 
belongs in that company and her 
leadership 
accomplishments… 

and (her work with) social justice 
and campus climate issues and 
how she wants to combine them 
in the future really makes her 
stand out,” Dyson said. “We have 
exceptional leaders in these areas 
but we rarely see them combined.”

be as high here as it needs to be on 
the coasts in order for our people 
to achieve the same standard of 
living.”

If a $15 minimum wage was 

only enacted in the city of Detroit, 
rather than the entire state, Hopp 
said he worries businesses might 
flock to the metro area to escape 
the high labor costs, harming 
surrounding areas. 

“But 
I 
think 
city-level 

minimum wages are tricky,” 
Hopp said. “While they may 
help workers at restaurants and 
hotels that can’t move out of the 
city, they serve as an incentive for 
factories, landscaping businesses 
and any other business that can 
relocate to move to the suburbs to 
do so.”

Despite these qualms, Hopp 

said he could foresee many 
positives of a statewide minimum 
wage increase, provided it is 
incremental.

“In contrast, a plan to increase 

the Michigan minimum wage in 
stages over time would benefit 
people 
who 
are 
struggling 

financially, help stem the tide 
of rising income inequality and 

do so with minimal harm to the 
economy or job market,” Hopp 
said.

Teia 
McGahey, 
a 
2017 

University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn alum and organizer 
for the Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization, 
said 
she 
first 

became involved with Detroit’s 
division of Fight for $15, D15, 
through the Social Justice League 
on Dearborn’s campus. After 
graduation, she worked as an 
organizer for Jobs With Justice, a 
nonprofit that fights for workers’ 
rights, until accepting a position 
with LEO a couple months ago.

“The first prong of a better 

future is first getting people what 
they need, and I think that’s what 
a lot of the D15 efforts focused 
on,” McGahey said. “Making 
sure people can eat, making sure 
people have adequate housing, 
adequate health insurance, those 
sorts of things that we need to 
just survive.”

Many champions for a higher 

minimum wage argue minimum 
wage has not been adjusted 
properly for inflation. A 2016 
report by Pew Research Center 
stated the $7.25 federal minimum 
wage had lost about 9.6 percent 
in 
purchasing 
power 
since 

its adoption in 2009. In 2015, 

The Economist reported that 
given the United States’ wealth 
compared to other countries, it 
would expect a minimum wage 
of $12.

Sociology 
lecturer 
Ian 

Robinson, who has worked on 
a team to analyze Washtenaw 
County’s wages, said though 
a $15 minimum wage might 
induce productivity losses, the 
magnitude of these effects are 
currently relatively unknown.

“If 
we 
had 
adjusted 
the 

minimum wage for productivity 
growth since the mid-1970s, it 
would now be at about $18 an 
hour,” Robinson said. “From the 
end of World War II through to the 
mid-’70s, the minimum wage did 
tend to keep up with productivity 
growth. In those 30 years, we had 
very low unemployment.”

While others share fears of the 

possible loss of productivity and 
lower employment related to a 
higher minimum wage, Robinson 
said much of this is offset by 
increased purchases from the 
lower class.

“Even if some jobs are lost in 

some sectors, the higher wage 
for millions of low-wage workers 
means 
increased 
purchasing 

power for working class people 
as a whole,” Robinson said. “That 

group will spend more money, and 
that extra spending will create 
more jobs. Maybe not in fast-
food, but from a macroeconomic 
point of view, the important 
questions are how many jobs are 
there and how well do they pay. 
If more money is spent on better 
paying jobs, that’s more good 
paying jobs in the economy.”

While Hopp said job loss is an 

undeniable counterpart of raising 
minimum wage, he has seen 
minimal negative impacts with 
small increases in places such as 
Seattle. However, a rapid increase 
to a $15 minimum is uncharted 
territory, so Hopp recommends 
proceeding cautiously.

“No one doubts that increasing 

wages decreases jobs,” Hopp said. 
“But we’ve had a lot of experience 
with small increases in the 
minimum wage that show very 
little impact on unemployment. 
We don’t have much data on 
large increases and so need to be 
cautious. The policies in Seattle 
and other places who are pushing 
minimum wages up at a faster 
pace look encouraging so far. But 
we’ll know more in a few years 
when we’ve had time to study the 
impacts.”

Among 
low-wage 
workers, 

McGahey note dstudents are 

especially susceptible to unfair 
wages.

“I think in every job I’ve had 

I’ve been underpaid, but that’s so 
many of us right now too, because 
we are an exploitable group of 
people,” McGahey said. “Students 
just need whatever we can get, so 
it’s really easy to pay us less than 
we deserve.”

As prices, especially rent costs, 

continue to soar in Ann Arbor 
and other cities, affordability 
becomes an even more pressing 
issue for many students. With the 
University’s median income of 
parents of students at $156,000, 
about three times the median 
income of Michigan households, 
LSA senior Zoe Proegler finds 
economic inequality on campus 
hard to ignore.

“Affluence is incredibly visible 

on our campus, from the clothes 
people wear to the places they 
live and eat to the ways they talk 
about socializing, vacations and 
more,” Proegler said. “I think 
after spending four years in that 
kind of environment, especially as 
someone who does occasionally 
have to worry about money, it was 
almost a given that I was going to 
be at least aware of the economic 
inequality discourse taking place 
on campus.”

In support of a $15 minimum 

wage in Michigan, Proegler said 
she especially sees a need for 
higher wages in expensive areas 
like Ann Arbor, Detroit, Lansing 
and Grand Rapids.

“A $15 minimum here would 

not only make achieving a livable 
income for working students 
possible, but would do a great 
deal to cut down on the growing 
wealth inequality in the county 
and help address the problem of a 
lack of service and food industry 
workers — or very long commutes 
— in cities like Ann Arbor,” 
Proegler said.

No matter the wage proposal, 

Brown takes issue with the 
process 
of 
minimum 
wage 

increases. He hopes the often 
politically-motivated 
method 

becomes more systematic and 
fair.

“In 
an 
ideal 
world, 
the 

legislators would agree on the 
‘right’ minimum wage for 2018 
and then have that value change 
smoothly 
and 
mechanically 

based on growth in average 
wages,” Brown said. “The current 
pattern –– no change, followed by 
big jumps –– reflects a political 
inability or unwillingness to 
agree on a more orderly process.”

with better resources, versus the 
underfunded school with a higher 
population of Latino and African-
American students.

“I had to make a choice: either 

live my values, when I know how 
harmful these schools can be, or 
was I going to use my privilege 
to get my daughter away from the 
kids who live next door to me” she 
said. “I decided that no child was 
worth less than my child.”

Jones 
explained 
this 

segregation is not occurring in 
remote locations far away from 
the University students she was 
addressing.

“Michigan schools are the 

second most segregated in the 
country,” she said. “Michigan 
schools have the worst test scores 
for Black kids in the country.”

She also explained the obvious 

problem of underrepresentation 
at the University.

“You look at the flagship 

university, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, and it is 5 percent black 
and 30 miles away from a majority 
Black city,” she said.

Jones posed the question of 

which children should be left 
behind in the educational system. 
She gave an example of an African-
American college student, Alicia, 
who was forced behind because 
of the broken educational pipeline 
within the American system.

“Alicia 
was 
part 
of 
the 

Tuscaloosa 
education 
system 

and she spent 13 years in entirely 
segregated schools that looked 
like her grandfather’s,” she said. 
“When Alicia took the ACT, she 
got a 16 … When I asked Alicia if 
she was going to take it again she 
responded, ‘Why? I can’t make up 
for everything, I haven’t had in 
time for this test.’”

Jones ended her talk by saying 

all students should have equal 
opportunities to go to schools 
which provide them with the 
resources necessary for success.

“You shouldn’t have to be an 

exceptional child in this country 
to get a quality education,” she 
said.

The 
presentation 
then 

shifted to a series of smaller 
presentations 
from 
students 

and 
University 
alumni. 
The 

presentations focused on the 
underrepresentation of Black and 
Latinx teachers, the financial 
burden of education for students 
of color and how Students of Color 
of Rackham — a graduate student 
organization — has made its voice 
heard on campus.

SCOR President Rosalyn Kent 

explained 
the 
overwhelming 

burden 
students 
of 
color 

experience 
in 
institutions 
of 

higher education, as they must 
balance their school work and 
while confronting racial issues on 
campus.

“We have to produce this 

scholarly work and be responsible 
for the hateful acts that happen 
around us and make sure we don’t 
drown in that hate,” Kent said.

The presentation ended with 

a Q&A session between Hannah-
Jones and Tabbye Chavous, the 
director of the National Center for 
Institutional Diversity.

Chavous’ 
first 
question 

addressed 
how 
to 
prepare 

students of color for an integrated 
context. Jones responded though 
integration would take careful 
planning and time, it’s vital for the 
future success for the country

“I’m pushing for a radical 

rethinking 
of 
our 
education 

system. It has to be that the 
curriculum is reflective of all 
children 
and 
all 
American 

history,” Jones said. “I’m not 
pushing for small numbers of 
Black children in white schools 
and forced assimilation.”

Jones also spoke about the lack 

of resources that schools with 

majority Black or Latino students 
have compared to white students.

“The 
difference 
is 
the 

concentration of poverty. Ninety 
percent of the parents in my 
daughter’s school cannot make 
up for the difference of what they 
do not get within the school” she 
said. “I wish we could disentangle 
race and resources.”

Rackham student Kayla Fike 

explained the necessity in coming 
to events like these to understand 
ones personal role in these issues.

“I think it’s valuable to come to 

these events because it helps us to 
see where our individual choices 
actually do make a difference and 
uphold inequality.

I

f you haven’t yet seen the 
eye-opening 
documentary 

“What the Health,” I highly 

recommend you watch it. My 
mouth was gaping wide open as I 
watched the entire film.

The directors, Kip Andersen 

and Keegan Kuhn, reveal that 
consuming meat and dairy can 
promote chronic illnesses like 
cancer, heart disease and diabetes. 
They cite the 2015 World Health 
Organization 
report, 
which 

declared processed meats (think: 
bacon, hot dogs and cold cuts) as 
“carcinogenic to humans” and 
also claimed dairy consumption 
is associated with prostate and 
breast cancers. These assertions 
serve as the foundation for their 
argument that adopting a vegan 
diet is optimal.

The 
friends 
and 
family 

members who I forced to watch the 
documentary immediately wrote 
it off as “vegan-propaganda.” 
This is undoubtedly true, but I 
still found it intriguing. From a 
young age, I had always believed 
meat, along with a glass of milk, 
was an important part of every 
meal. I even believed the two food 
products were healthy (unless, 
say, the meat was deep-fried). The 
documentary challenged these 
established beliefs. I decided to 
do some digging on my own to see 
if Andersen and Kuhn were on to 
something.

It turns out that the WHO 

report categorizing processed 
meats 
as 
carcinogenic 
— 

effectively 
grouping 
them 

together 
with 
tobacco 
and 

asbestos — is misleading. The 
WHO panel found “sufficient 
evidence” 
to 
support 
the 

idea that meat consumption 
contributes to cancer, but that 
does not mean that meat is even 
close to being as carcinogenic as 
tobacco or asbestos.

In 
fact, 
much 
of 
the 

documentary 
is 
viewed 
as 

intentionally 
misleading. 

Several sources, including Time, 
have criticized the directors’ 
exaggerated 
claims 
and 

misrepresentations of science.

As I continued to dig for 

information regarding what a 
healthy diet looked like, I found 
a wealth of information but no 
definitive answers. There appears 
to be a general consensus that 
doctors 
are 
recommending 

patients to consume less meat 
along with less sugar, but many 
believe that moderate meat and 
sugar consumption is not as 
harmful as Andersen and Kuhn 
depict it.

Andersen and Kuhn discussed 

claims of deceptive research by 
the meat and dairy industries 
in the documentary, and while 
researching, I, too, came across 
biased scientific studies. The 
New York Times broke a story in 
2016 when it was discovered that 
the sugar industry paid scientists 
to downplay the link between 
sugar and heart disease. Knowing 
this, who are we as consumers 
supposed to trust when it comes 
to determining what is truly 
healthy?

The U.S. government has 

attempted to step in to help 
consumers make wiser, more 
health-conscious decisions, but 
even the government’s efforts 
aren’t completely unbiased. The 
U.S. Department of Agriculture 
introduced their Food Guide 
Pyramid in 1992 as a nutrition 
education tool to recommend 
what types of food consumers 
should eat every day. The USDA 
continues to release updated 
tools like MyPyramid and their 
most recent MyPlate. Despite 
doctors across the country urging 
patients to reduce their meat and 
dairy consumption, the tools 
continue to display meat and 
dairy as prominent portions of 
every meal. It’s clear to see why 
people, including myself, believe 
meat and dairy are necessary 

ingredients to every meal, and 
thus why they are a part of a 
balanced diet.

Meat and dairy have been able 

to persist as a necessary ingredient 
in every meal because of the 
industries’ power (read: money) 
to influence governmental actors. 
The meat industry spent $17.7 
million in 2014 on contributions 
to various political campaigns 
and direct federal government 
lobbying to ensure that their 
products stay a staple in the 
American diet. The Washington 
Post reported years ago about 
how the USDA attempted to 
deemphasize the importance of 
meat and dairy when creating a 
new nutritional tool for consumers 
and how the organization quickly 
abandoned the plan after private 
sector backlash.

I find it worrisome that 

the public can’t even trust the 
government 
to 
produce 
an 

unbiased and accurate depiction 
of what a healthy diet should 
look like. If the private sector is 
willingly taking part in deception 
and 
devious 
marketing, 
the 

government should step in to protect 
consumers, no matter what losses 
may be incurred by producers.

If the government, or any 

organization, were to fund a 
completely independent series of 
studies to decipher what a truly 
healthy diet looks like, the obesity 
epidemic that plagues the world 
could be halted. Research may not 
initially lead to a swift change in 
consumption, but with the passage 
of time, habits are malleable. 
Nobody initially thought that 
tobacco was harmful to humans, 
but 
after 
extensive 
research 

and many years of consumer 
adjustment, people finally began 
changing their habits. I propose 
that the same progression can 
occur with people’s diets.

Mass shootings have a gender

R

ecently, I have been 
feeling a bit stressed 
out about my future. As 

a second semester 
freshman, I already 
feel 
pressure 
to 

get good grades, 
choose my major 
and, not to mention, 
get an internship. 
However, 
in 
a 

strange 
way, 
it 

has felt good to 
be stressed about 
these 
things 

because I feel as if 
I am on the way to becoming 
an adult.

Then, I saw Kylie Jenner’s 

announcement regarding the 
birth of her and rapper Travis 
Scott’s daughter, Stormi. I also 
found out that she had her first 
child at 20-years-old, only one 
year older than I am.

When 
I 
first 
saw 
the 

announcement, I was shocked. 
Granted, I didn’t tweet about 
it and express my anxiety like 
so many others did, but I did 
frantically ask my friends if they 
had heard the news. I wasn’t 
judging Jenner for being “too 
young” or “too immature” to be 
a mother. I freaked out because 
I’m only a year younger than 
her, yet while I can barely take 
care of myself, Jenner manages 
to run a $420 million company 
and keep up with several other 
business 
ventures 
including 

endorsement 
deals 
and 
a 

clothing line. And now, she has 
a child.

I realize now I shouldn’t 

have been so shocked that 
someone my age had a baby. I’m 
at a point in my life during which 
my peers will undoubtedly go 
through critical life changes, 
both in their professional and 
personal lives. I, too, will go 
through these changes. It’s 
terrifying, but then again, the 
prospect of going to college 
scared me a year ago, yet I’m 
getting by. I think the reason 
so many people have something 
to say about Jenner’s baby is 
not because of some misguided 
need to hate on her. It’s because 
young people are taught to 
compare themselves to others 
their age, and when they see 
someone who seems to be more 
“advanced” than them, they 
tend to get frightened.

As 
a 
college 
student, 

I constantly see my peers 
compare themselves to each 

other. 
Students 
ask 

each other questions 
not 
because 
of 
a 

genuine interest, but 
because 
they 
want 

to know how they 
compare. 
Ranging 

from inquiries about 
summer 
plans 
to 

GPAs, these questions 
students 
ask 
each 

other are a way for 
them to gauge where 

they fall on their made-up 
spectrum of success. This need 
to compete is perfectly natural 
and important, because it keeps 
young adults in touch with 
their peers and aware of the 
world around them; however, 
it’s also important to be aware 
of this competitiveness and 
keep it in check.

College pits students against 

each other as well, with exam 
curves 
depending 
on 
how 

others’ score and special awards 
given to those with high GPAs. 
While 
healthy 
competition 

drives students to do their best, 
I’ve found students often lose 
confidence and motivation to 
do well if they feel they are not 
as accomplished as their peers. 
I sometimes feel this way when 
I see how my peers are doing. 
Other times, I become scared, 
because they seem so ahead of 
me in every way. Jenner, while 
not my peer, was a person who 
made people, including myself, 
feel this way.

Seeing Jenner have a baby 

made me feel as if I’m suddenly 
being forced to grow up and 
be an adult. Suddenly, my own 
issues about school seemed 
juvenile and less monumental 
than hers’, as if I was behind 
her developmentally because 
she’s dealing with being a new 
mother while I complain about 
my class workload. I don’t know 
exactly why I feel this way, but 
I think part of it is because I’m 
almost the same age as her and 
she’s going through perhaps 
one of the most monumental 
life changes a person can ever 
go through.

It doesn’t make sense that 

I would suddenly feel this 
way, given her many other 
achievements. Yet, her wealth 

never made me feel as if I had 
some “growing up” to do because 
I’ve 
become 
desensitized 

to young people with large 
amounts of money. There are 
so many young YouTubers and 
celebrities who show off their 
wealth on social media. Yet, 
none of these wealthy people 
around 
my 
age, 
including 

the ones who are married or in 
committed 
relationships, 
have 

children.

Non-wealthy young people 

are waiting to have children, too; 
in January 2016, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
reported, 
“the 
mean 
age 
of 

mothers has increased from 2000 
to 2014 for all birth orders, with 
age at first birth having the largest 
increase, up from 24.9 years in 
2000 to 26.3 years in 2014.” While 
I know there are mothers globally 
who are even younger than Jenner, 
hearing about her daughter still 
shocked me.

Despite 
how 
surprising 

Jenner’s pregnancy was to so many 
people, there’s no need for anyone 
to feel frightened when they see 
Jenner has had a baby at such a 
young age, nor is there any reason 
to criticize her. She’s an extremely 
wealthy celebrity and is therefore 
in a completely different position 
than most people her age; it doesn’t 
make sense for me to compare 
my life to her life. In addition, as 
someone who is in an awkward 
transitional phase in which I feel 
like neither a child nor an adult, I 
believe it’s important for people my 
age to remember there’s no need 
for them to compare their lives to 
anyone else’s, much less to that of 
a beauty mogul with a multimillion 
dollar empire. Everyone progresses 
to different stages of their lives at 
different rates, and that’s okay.

There’s no need for people 

to feel as if they need to compare 
themselves to their peers at all, 
either. Competition should be 
healthy and meant to motivate 
everyone to succeed, not just those 
who have the highest GPAs or 
the most impressive résumé. As 
young adults, we need to focus on 
ourselves and how we are doing 
instead of trying to outcompete 
our peers. Jenner is not our peer, 
and with this in mind, we should 
leave her alone.

W

hen I first decided 
to 
write 
columns 

on mental health, I 

knew I would eventually 
have to write one in 
the wake of a mass 
shooting. In fact, it was 
the only column I was 
positive I would write, 
because, like clockwork, 
mass 
shootings 
keep 

happening 
again 
and 

again. 
Last 
year 
in 

America, a mass shooting 
— 
which 
is 
defined 

as an attack in which 
four or more people are killed 
indiscriminately in a public space 
— occurred about once per month.

In fact, the two deadliest mass 

shootings in American history 
(Las Vegas and Orlando) have 
occured during my time as an 
undergraduate. This is insane.

What is also egregious is the 

use of mental illness as a scapegoat 
by the National Rifle Association 
and their political vassals. People 
with mental health problems are 
easy targets for those looking to 
wash their hands of blood without 
actually doing anything.

According to the Scattergood 

Foundation, one of the most 
common stereotypes about people 
with mental health problems 
are that they are dangerous 
and unpredictable. Per a 2006 
national survey, 60 percent of 
respondents thought a person 
with schizophrenia was likely 
to be violent, and 32 percent of 
respondents thought the same 
of those with major depression. 
This, of course, flies in the face 
of 
reality; 
Jessica 
Henderson 

Daniel, president of the American 
Psychological Association, said in a 
statement after last week’s shooting 
that, “it is important to remember 
that only a very small percentage 
of violent acts are committed by 
people who are diagnosed with, or 
in treatment for, mental illness.”

Despite 
this, 
President 

Donald Trump and the NRA have 
repeatedly 
associated 
mental 

health 
problems 
with 
mass 

shooters. For instance, in the 
aftermath of the recent shooting at 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High 
School, the President tweeted: 
“So many signs that the Florida 
shooter was mentally disturbed, 
even expelled from school for bad 

and erratic behavior. Neighbors 
and classmates knew he was a 
big problem. Must always report 

such instances to 
authorities, 
again 

and again!” Mind 
you, as a candidate, 
Trump 
once 

boisterously claimed 
that he could shoot 
someone and not 
lose any voters.

Like with most 

of the president’s 
sage 
tweets, 
my 

eyes 
rolled. 
First 

off, the FBI received a tip in 
January concerning the Parkland 
shooter. Furthermore, when law 
enforcement is called to the scene 
of an incident where someone is 
having a mental health crisis, that 
person, usually a person of color, 
may well end up being shot, as 
was the case of Quintonio LeGrier 
in Chicago and Bobby Bennett in 
Dallas. Not surprisingly, the victim 
has a mental health problem in 25 
percent of all police shootings in 
the U.S.

But I digress. If Trump, the 

Republican Party and the gun lobby 
want to talk about populations who 
pose a greater risk of committing a 
mass shooting, then we need to talk 
about men, not people with mental 
health problems.

You have probably heard the 

term “toxic masculinity,” which is 
the harmful manifestation of social 
norms associated with masculinity, 
such as aggression and entitlement. 
Mass shootings are a particularly 
bloody manifestation, but toxic 
masculinity also drives sexual and 
domestic violence. For instance, 
classmates of the Parkland shooter 
say that he stalked and abused his 
ex-girlfriend and was expelled for 
fighting her new boyfriend.

If you want to know more of 

what I mean, look no further than 
the final video manifesto posted by 
the shooter who killed six people 
near the University of California, 
Santa Barbara, in 2014.

“For the last eight years of my 

life, since I hit puberty,” the shooter 
says, “I’ve been forced to endure an 
existence of loneliness, rejection 
and unfulfilled desires, all because 
girls have never been attracted to 
me. Girls gave their affection and 
sex and love to other men, never 
to me.”

The transcript of the video 

is hard to read but the shooter’s 
message is crystal clear: He 
believed that he was entitled to 
have women fulfill his desires. 
What was he to do when his 
entitlement was denied, something 
he considered “a crime I can never 
get over?” The answer was, of 
course, violence.

The dangerous sense of male 

entitlement these shooters feel 
and the wrath that consumes 
them when they feel rejected 
extends beyond women’s bodies. 
In 1991, a former postal worker 
killed three people in Royal Oak, 
Michigan because he felt entitled 
to a job. In fact, approximately 30 
percent of mass shootings occur 
in the workplace, usually by angry 
or recently fired male employees. 
Whatever these men feel entitled 
to, they use extreme acts of violence 
as retribution once they perceive 
themselves to have been slighted.

Toxic masculinity is learned. 

About five years ago, I had a 
jarring conversation with an 11- 
or 12-year-old boy and his father, 
who had gone through a rocky 
divorce. During our conversation, 
the boy casually asserted, to his 
father’s approval, that all women 
were deceitful and out to trick 
men. Here was this young boy 
who 
was 
already 
harboring 

sexist 
sentiments 
because 
of 

his disgruntled father, who was 
probably scorned because the 
divorce challenged his perceived 
entitlement over his ex-wife. I am 
not saying that this boy will grow 
up to be a mass shooter, just that 
one does not have to have a mental 
health problem to fall under the 
influence of toxic masculinity.

Discourse on mental health in 

the wake of mass shootings is just 
a red herring in a sea of bullets. In 
order to create a truly safer country, 
we need gun control as well as 
a movement to challenge and 
empower men to unlearn what we 
have been taught about aggression, 
violence and entitlement. Imagine if 
the president had tweeted that toxic 
masculinity is a national problem in 
the aftermath of this latest school 
shooting. Perhaps that will happen 
when our president is a woman.

“Sometimes we just look at each 

other and ask, ‘What would Big 
Bird do?’”

This is the question Pete 

Holmes, creator and star of HBO’s 
comedy show “Crashing,” and his 
writers ask themselves when they 
don’t know where to go with his 
character — a clean and somewhat 
naïve version of his younger self, 
navigating life and laughter in the 
brutal world of show business. 
Holmes recently talked to The 
Daily via a conference video chat to 
discuss the show’s second season, 
his experience in comedy and 
what it’s like to relive his own life 
through the show.

The loveable “Sesame Street”-

esque 
aspects 
of 
Holmes’s 

character 
are 
what 
makes 

“Crashing” special among other 
shows of the same “comedian’s 
life” type like “Louie.” He’s 
completely genuine as a person, 
fallible and sometimes not even 
that good at comedy. But these 
chinks in his armor are integral to 
the show’s overall flavor, bringing 
a fresh perspective to a story many 
comedy fans are already aware of. 
Holmes is really good at telling 
bad jokes, making his character’s 
newbie 
status 
on 
the 
scene 

believable and infusing a youthful 
bounce into the show. “Crashing” 
follows this fictionalized version 
of Holmes through his struggles as 
a comedian coming up in the New 
York scene after his wife leaves 
him, literally crashing on other 
comedians’ couches as he tries to 
make it in the tough club scene. 
Holmes says he “wants to take the 
struggle of doing stand-up and 
add on top of it as many relatable 

jokes and situations as possible.” 
The show definitely achieves this, 
making the difficult journey up 
comedy’s ranks understandable 
from an outside perspective and 
focusing in on the humanity of it 
all.

The first season of the show, 

which came out last spring, laid 

the foundation for an interesting 
look into the realities of a young 
comedian’s life. Holmes’s own 
experiences are the basis for 
“Crashing” — a series of emotional 
and professional ups and downs 
that keep the viewer engaged 
and invested in the show’s plot. 
He created “Crashing” with the 
guidance of co-producer Judd 
Apatow (“Knocked Up”), who 
helped to balance the show’s 
narrative to create something 
unique. After his first endeavor — a 
talk show on TBS called “The Pete 
Holmes Show” — Holmes says he 
asked himself, “What is the story 
that is kind of the most personal to 

me, that only I could tell?” His life 
was somewhat of a rollercoaster, 
Holmes reflected.

“Well, I was raised religious. 

I got married when I was 22. 
My wife left me when I was 28, 
and then I really started trying 
to become a stand-up. I was like, 
‘That sounds like a Judd Apatow 
idea.’” Holmes flew out to New 
York for what he says was “15 
minutes” with Apatow while 
he was filming Amy Schumer’s 
“Trainwreck,” a meeting which 
would prove integral to the show’s 
creation.

The balance between drama 

and comedy is what really stands 
out about “Crashing,” especially 
in its new season, which currently 
airs on Sundays at 10:30 p.m. EST. 
Holmes says Apatow is the real 
master behind this equilibrium.

“I basically tell him what really 

happened in my life and he figures 
out how to make that funny,” 
Holmes said. “I’ll tell him for 
example, ‘There’s a lot of solitude 
and eating Chinese food,’ and he’ll 
be like, ‘OK, you can do that for like 
a scene, but you have to work at 
Cold Stone Creamery.’ So I’ll give 
him credit on that one.”

The second season of the 

show tackles more existential 
and serious topics than the last, 
exploring addiction with frequent 
guest star Artie Lange (“The 
Howard Stern Show”) in the 
episode “Artie” and the battle to 
maintain faith in the spotlight 
with magician Penn Jillette in 
the season’s premiere “Atheist.” 
These themes of self-discovery 
and realization give a new edge 
to Holmes’s character, bringing 
him from “Big Bird” to something 
else — a poignant representation 
of what it means to change while 
pursuing your dreams.

MUSIC ALBUM REVIEW

 
In a trend of music videos 
that have literally nothing to 
do with the song, The Chain-
smokers’ video for “You Owe 
Me” starts off with two solid 
minutes of mundane house-
work. Singer Andrew Tag-
gart vacuums, washes dishes 
and mops a spotless expanse 
of tile while staring blankly 
into the camera as Alex Pall, 
the other half of the duo, 
wipes a suspicious splotch of 
blood off of the stairs outside 
and irons a pair of pants.
 What’s the deal? Some 
greater commentary on how 
EDM-pop musicians are 

normal people too? Pall sets 
down a footstool, then deftly 
uses it to right a crooked pic-

ture. Taggart lights candles 
slowly and robotically, all 
the while gazing at the 
viewer with that same blank 
stare. A wide shot shows 
viewers that he’s standing 
behind a table filled with 

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘YOU OWE ME’

“You Owe Me”

The Chainsmokers

Disruptor Records

DISRUPTOR RECORDS

The 
end 
of 
Feb. 
and 

beginning of Mar. are always 
nostalgic for me. The sky is gray, 
the snow is melting, the green 
that’s been hidden all winter is 
slowly beginning to make its 
resurgence. Everything seems 
melancholic, but hopeful.

I first listened to Lorde in 

the backseat of my best friend’s 
mom’s 
Honda. 
We 
were 

approaching our sophomore 
year of high school, a time I 
now refer to as the summer of 
“Royals.”

“You know,” my best friend 

said, “she’s only a year older 
than us.”

“Royals” played on repeat 

for 
the 
entirety 
of 
that 

summer, 
through 
poolside 

speakers and the car radios of 
the upperclassmen who drove 
us around our small suburban 
town to bonfires and 24-hour 
Coney 
Islands. 
It 
became, 

to me — the naïve, careless 
15-year-old that I was — an 
anthem for the things I could 
not articulate.

Pure Heroine came out that 

Sept. My best friend and I 
danced around her bedroom 

in our homecoming dresses to 
“Ribs,” shouting over the music 
that we should’ve ditched our 
dates and gone to the dance 
with each other. We played “No 
Better” at every party, drunk 
off of wine coolers purchased 
by somebody’s mother.

That Oct., I fell into a 

youthful, foolish kind of small 
town love that only a 15-year-
old could fall into. He was two 
years older than me and the 
captain of our high school’s 
soccer team: the quintessential 
teenage daydream.

He and I didn’t have much 

to do but drive around and go 
for milkshakes at 3:00 a.m. 
Somehow, though, this was 
enough. It was magical. It 
was a feeling I couldn’t put 
my finger on until I heard 
“400 Lux,” a song that, then, 
explained all of the magic 
in our naïve relationship’s 
mundanity; and now, it makes 
me feel 15 with butterflies in 
my stomach again.

Four years later, which might 

as well have been a lifetime, 
I listened to Melodrama for 
the first time in the backseat 
of a taxi. I was leaving New 
York City, the place I’d called 
home for the summer and had, 
in turn, fallen terribly in love 

with. I listened to the album 
in order, and then over again. 
I cried hysterically the whole 
time.

I cried because Melodrama 

was the first album I’d ever 
considered mine — one that 
validated 
feelings 
that 
I’d 

felt 
on 
a 
conscious 
level, 

and 
simultaneously 
pulled 

feelings that I’d never felt out 
of the depths of my 19-year-old 
psyche.

Each song was a masterpiece. 

Each song held a piece of me 
in it. Each song made the 
messiness of what it means to 
be my age OK. Every time I’d 
become infatuated with the 
wrong person, every inevitable 
end of a relationship, every 
night that ended in a failed 
quest for belonging — it was all 
OK.

Lorde’s music has carried me 

through my naïve adolescence 
and 
is 
still 
carrying 
me 

through my messy transition to 
adulthood, through backseats 
and boyfriends and long nights. 
I’d never quite understood that 
music has the ability to save 
someone. But at this moment, if 
there’s anything that I can say 
that I understand completely, 
it’s that Lorde’s music saves me 
every single day.

I recently witnessed a professor 

of 
music 
accuse 
a 
famous 

20th-century composer of having 
“ruined music.” The class was 
discussing important orchestral 
works by 20th-century composers, 
and a student mentioned Boulez’s 
“Le Marteau sans Maitre,” a 
blistering avant-garde work filled 
with rhythmic and harmonic 
dissonances. The professor claimed 
that he hated Boulez, that Boulez 
should not be studied as he had 
ruined music.

Boulez has always been a 

controversial 
figure 
among 

20th-century 
composers 
and 

critics. His death in 2016 left 
behind 
a 
controversial 
legacy 

for musicologists, scholars and 
classical 
music 
aficionados 
to 

pick apart. As a conductor, Boulez 
went through periods in which he 
conducted music primarily from 
the classical era and periods in 
which he conducted music almost 
exclusively from the modern era. 
As a writer and critic, Boulez 
published articles both in defense 
of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of 
Spring” and in condemnation of 
Schoenberg’s (radical) late works. 
His life as a critic and conductor was 
riddled with these inconsistencies.

As the composition professor 

explained to the class, Boulez 
“ruined music” in that he advocated 
for a complete rejection of the study 
of the Western canon of classical 
music. His famed summer program 
in Darmstadt was conceived almost 
entirely in this vein: He refused 
to 
study 
any 
non-modernist 

compositions, claiming that the 
modernist 
movement 
required 

a 
rejection 
of 
the 
historical 

legacies of classical music and the 
use of radical new forms based 
on emancipated rhythmic and 
harmonic dissonances.

Boulez’s 
infamous 
article 

“Schoenberg 
Is 
Dead,” 
for 

example, represents some of his 
most 
scathing 
condemnations 

of anything but the most radical 
modernist 
music. 
Schoenberg’s 

late explorations of tonal music, 
Boulez asserted, had “went off in 
the wrong direction so persistently 
that it would be hard to find an 
equally 
mistaken 
perspective 

in the entire history of music.” 
Schoenberg’s 
was 
erroneously 

attempting “to construct works of 
the same essence as that of those in 
the sound-universe he had just left 
behind,” a practice which “led to 
the decrepitude of the larger part of 
his serial oeuvre.”

“It is time to neutralize the 

setback,” Boulez exclaims, and 
“grasp the serial domain as a 
whole.”

Though 
Boulez 
may 
be 

among the strongest examples of 
modernist and rejectionist artists, 
this idea of rejecting historical 
forms is the true mark of an avant-
garde artist. This is the modern 
legacy of the avant-garde music: the 

desertion of artistic customs that 
had developed over generations, 
the constant need for radical 
innovation and separation from 
historical precedent.

Composers such as Boulez chose 

to break entirely with conventional 
musical forms, writing pieces with 
purely abstract titles in which 
no note occurs more frequently 
than any other note. These pieces 
are hard to palate and harder 
still to learn to love, especially 
for those audiences that do not 
have an extensive background in 

contemporary classical music.

The same can be said of many 

of the avant-garde periods most 
famous plays, particularly Samuel 
Beckett’s 
famed 
“Waiting 
for 

Godot”; while the play has been 
frequently cited by playwrights 
and other theater buffs for its lack 
of plot and intriguing ambiguous 
meaning, few modern companies 
can sell tickets to productions of 
this work.

Modern 
artists, 
however, 

are beginning to find new and 
intriguing means of responding 
to and shaping this rejectionist 
legacy. For many, this involves 
using the language of the pre-
avant-garde styles in avant-garde 
forms and structures. For others, 
this involves using the language of 
the avant-garde in pre-avant-garde 
forms and structures. In both 
instances, however, the influences 
of the avant-garde and the pre-
avant-garde are broken up and 
juxtaposed, sparking the formation 
of unprecedented yet familiar 
works.

Modern playwrights are finding 

new ways of using nonlinear or 
other non-standard forms to depict 
classic subjects. Stephen Adly 
Guirgis’s “The Last Days of Judas 
Iscariot,” for example, used an 
undeniably avant-garde influenced 
plot structure to reference Biblical 
messages 
about 
the 
human 

condition. Though these messages 
were conveyed through the guise 
of a purgatorial trial, they were 
conveyed in the language of the 
decidedly pre-avant-garde.

Modern composers are also 

finding new ways of using non-
standard formal structures as a 
means of reinterpreting Classical 
concepts and forms. Ted Hearne’s 
“The Law of Mosaics,” for example, 
uses humorous juxtapositions to 

deconstruct standard pieces of the 
string orchestra repertoire. The 
result, Hearne explains, is a “law 
of mosaics” in which the meaning 
of the work is derived not through 
the standard idea of development 
but through the piecing together of 
different pieces “in the absence of 
the whole.”

Modern opera also shares many 

of 
these 
tendencies, 
although 

the avant-garde period has had 
significantly less of an effect on the 
genre. John Adams’s many operas 
about recent historical events, for 
example, use standard operatic 
form and convention to interpret 
previously non-operatic thematic 
material. 
Jonathan 
Dawe’s 

“Cracked Orlando,” on the other 
hand, does the opposite — Grazio 
Braccioli’s libretto, used in Vivaldi’s 
opera, is fragmented using fractal 
geometry into a series of ideas 
between onstage and projected 
dancers and singers that interact 
throughout the work.

Our modern idiom is best 

described as an idiom lacking a 
defining characteristic: an idiom 
derived entirely from fragmented 
ideas taken from other historical 
idioms. Unlike the avant-garde 
period, we are no longer obsessed 
with the creation of new forms 
or the rejection of old forms. We 
are obsessed, instead, with the 
deconstruction of old ideas into 
new forms.

It is the nonlinear narrative, I 

believe, that will be the defining 
legacy of the 21st century. Just as 
the 20th century was the century of 
“rejection,” the 21st century will be 
the century of juxtaposition. Just 
as Boulez “ruined music,” so are 
today’s artists de-contextualizing 
and 
reinterpreting 
historical 

practices to the point that they 
cannot be recognized for what they 
were originally intended to do.

Our century, furthermore, is 

defined by benefits of the internet 
and the many different types of 
music that we can all access. Music 
cannot be ruined because it can no 
longer be strictly defined. While 
Boulez and the avant-garde artists 
may have pushed the performing 
arts in a radical new direction, 
the internet has allowed us to 
experience both new and old art 
— the rejected and the radically 
new. We are experiencing a radical 
democratization of art: A period in 
which the artists and artistic work 
that we consume is defined almost 
entirely by our own taste, not that 
of an artistic program director or a 
museum curator.

Boulez may have changed music 

but he did not “ruin” it. The same 
can be said of every artist that 
came before him, and the same 
will be said of every artist that 
comes after. He did redefine art, 
however, and we are still struggling 
to understand the full implications 
of the avant-garde movement he 
propagated.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
On Lorde, love & spring

JENNA BARLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

The balance 

between drama 

and comedy 
is what really 

stands out about 

“Crashing,” 

especially in its 

new season

already blazing candles — a 
séance? Some sort of weird 
Ouija ritual?
 The video’s bloody cli-
max reveals that dinner 
guests are in fact the dinner. 
Funny. A bit overplayed, 
maybe. Kind of like a blood-
ier version of The Ready 
Set’s music video for “Love 
Like Woe” from 2010. We’ve 
gotten to the point where 
blood has almost lost its 
shock value, and although it 
makes for a relatively light 
hearted spin on what might 
otherwise be a drawn out, 
overdramatic piece about 
mopiness and vengeance, it 
isn’t exactly unique in the 
grand scheme of music vid-
eos. “You Owe Me” itself is 
smoother and slower paced 
than a lot of the duo’s pop 
hits, including the obnox-
iously infamous “Closer.” 
Maybe this video heralds a 
new era for The Chainsmok-
ers: less of that snappy four 
chord progression primed 
for radio release and more of 
something different. We’ll 
have to wait and see.

There is a seemingly endless 

stream of movies that render 
the complication and emotional 
devastation that terminal illness 
inflicts 
upon 

love. 
From 
the 

classic “Terms of 
Endearment” 
to 

the teenage tragedy 
“The Fault in Our 
Stars,” moviegoers are eternally 
transfixed by the storyline of love 
persisting in the face of imminent 
death. In Stephanie Laing’s Netflix 
original “Irreplaceable You,” Abbie 
(Gugu 
Mbatha-Raw, 
“Belle”), 

a 
headstrong 
woman 
freshly 

diagnosed with stage four cancer, 

takes charge of her grief by striving 
to find a new love for her fianceé, the 
sheepish yet sweet Sam (Michiel 
Huisman, “Age of Adaline”), before 
she passes. Though Abbie’s life-
changing condition presents new 
challenges, it is the irrationality 
illustrated which shows that the 

soulmate-level love 
shared by Sam and 
Abbie is powerful 
enough 
to 
grant 

an 
immunity 
of 

sorts that prevents 

their relationship from ever truly 
wavering. Despite the frustration 
that the unrealistic resiliency of 
their relationship evokes, there is 
something strangely commendable 
about the film’s ability to restrain 
from trying to do too much with 
such minimal potential.

This acceptance of its limitations 

aside, the film is still fundamentally 
flawed in its initial failure to invest 
viewers into Sam and Abbie’s 
relationship, a misstep that slows 
the already dry and uninspired 
plotline. The brief, commercial-like 
montage filled with slow motion 
flashbacks of Abbie and Sam as 
children and teenagers near the 
beginning of the film serves as a stab 
at providing background. However, 
attempting to sum up Abbie and 
Sam’s history within the span of 
a few unbearably cheesy minutes 
is ineffective, and unintentionally 
forms a gap between the characters 
and the audience. Instead of 
providing detail or substance about 
why Sam and Abbie fell in love or 
giving context for the backbone of 
their relationship, the montage is 

‘Irreplaceable’ plays it safe

In a Poem Unlimited is musician 

Meghan Remy’s (a.k.a U.S. Girls) 
eighth studio album since she 
started exploring the depths of 
the pop genre with the release of 
Introduction in 2008. At first listen, 
U.S. Girls’s In a Poem Unlimited 
is a groovy experimental pop 
record with horn-laced tracks and 
whammy guitar hits that move 
through the decades. It’s a record 
of emotional exploration jumping 
across the base of free psychedelic 
rock to peaks of rigid electronic pop 
all in 37 minutes.

Despite its varied sound, In a 

Poem Unlimited contains three 
constants: 
Remy’s 
disco-era, 

flower petal voice, the theme of 
domestic abuse and her emotional 
reactions to the state of the world 
in her lyrics. While the entertaining 
instrumental diversity makes it 
hard to pick up the emotionally 
exhausting content at first, the 
second listen slams into you with 
each note and every carried out 
synth.

Remy 
begins 
the 
record 

showcasing her talent to hit a 
nostalgic ’70s groove tune with the 
clean and precise sounds of modern 
production using combinations of 

light drum taps and dragging synth 
notes in “Velvet 4 Sale.” Its light 
sounding nature is contradicted in 
Remy’s vengeful lyrics. She sings, 
“But don’t forget the revenge / Act 
like you got some velvet for sale / 
Then, you destroy their hope for 
deliverance / Don’t offer no reason 
/ Instill in them the fear that comes 
with being prey,” offering a piece 

of advice to others who may have 
been taken advantage of or abused 
in a similar way to how she was 
that’s revealed in the later songs of 
the record.

This disco pop tone of the record 

flows through the first few songs 
and grows into a more calm and 
easy flowing beat with hints of 
violin and light ’90s nightclub pop 
notes. It sounds smooth and free, 
even with its noticeably repetitive 
nature and leaves us in a place of 
relief with “Rosebud.” Remy sings 
“Who holds the key is what you 
need to know / you and you alone,” 
giving listeners a note of hope as she 
displays a moment of self-saving 
from the turmoil she’s endured that 

parallels the smooth and forward-
moving sound of her voice.

But, Remy doesn’t allow her 

listeners to get comfortable with 
her style as she moves in an 
entirely different direction and 
circles back into a place of rigid 
trauma in “Incidental Boogie.” 
Remy sings “Life made no sense 
without a beating, you see? / And 
life was just too quiet / Without 
no one screaming at me,” turning 
over ear-aching synths and robotic 
voices expressing the bottom level 
of acceptance with abuse. Her 
troubled vocals move through this 
disturbing numbness throughout 
the 
entire 
record 
until 
she 

interrupts with “Poem.”

Remy moves through the soft 

electric sounds of “Poem” and 
ends with the lyrics, “What are we 
gonna do to change?” and begins a 
journey of recovery in her final song 
“Time.” She sings, “When there is 
nothing there is still time,” over a 
fast and groovy pop sound giving 
herself and listeners a place to step 
out of the muddy past.

Each song on In a Poem 

Unlimited is carefully crafted to 
stand on its own, but listening to it 
in the context of its whole cultivates 
a cathartic experience of heavy 
reconciliation and recovery from 
domestic abuse laid over a deep 
exploration of all things pop.

‘In a Poem Unlimited’ is 
as cathartic as it is groovy

“Irreplaceable 

You”

SELENA AGUILERA

“In books I have traveled, not 

only to other worlds, but into my 
own.” - Anna Quindlen

It’s the end of February, spring 

break is looming and all I want 
to do is get out of Michigan. 
Whenever I’m struck by a case of 
wanderlust, the cause and the cure 
are usually the same: books. So, 
in honor of spring break, here is a 
list of books that will both get you 
itching to travel and allow you to 
do so from the comfort of your own 
home. Accompanying each book is 
a song to listen to while reading — 
something that will set the mood 
for the specific type of adventure 
the author is describing.

1.“Eat, 
Pray, 
Love” 
by 

Elizabeth Gilbert / “Unwritten” 
by Natasha Bedingfield

The first time I read “Eat, Pray, 

Love” was on a family road trip 
to Maine. I was 13, so obviously a 
family vacation was the last thing 
I wanted to do. Like, Mom — I 
can’t believe you made me skip 
Sam Zipin’s bat mitzvah for this. 
In a huff, I ended up reading “Eat, 
Pray, Love” twice over the course 
of that trip. Liz became my guide 
on a journey I hadn’t even known I 
wanted to take. She’s not fearless — 
instead, she is unafraid of her own 
fear. Her descriptions of traveling 
alone make the adult world seem 
exciting rather than scary, which 
was exactly the kind of escapism 
I needed as a nervous middle-
schooler (and also the kind I need 
right now). Gilbert’s eloquent 
rendering of Italy is enough to 
make any snow-sorry Michigander 
sigh: “Just for a few months of 
one’s life, is it so awful to… nap in 
a garden, in a patch of sunlight, in 
the middle of the day, right next to 
your favorite fountain? And then to 
do it again the next day?” I dare you 
to read this book and not want to 
go on a year-long solo adventure of 
self-discovery (and also somehow 
to feel as though you already have).

2. “The Alchemist” by Paulo 

Coelho / “El Condor Pasa (If I 
Could)” by Simon & Garfunkel

I’ll be honest: My inaugural 

experience with this book was in 
my eighth-grade English class, 
and I definitely Spark-noted some 
of it (sorry, Mrs. P). I reread it 
last year, and it’s so good. Coelho 
is a master storyteller. His tale 
takes the reader on a literal 
and metaphorical journey with 
Santiago, the young Andalusian 

shepherd who is searching for 
meaning in the fantastical, mirage-
filled Egyptian desert. Coelho’s 
language is awe-inspiring and 
almost spiritual: “We are travelers 
on a cosmic journey, stardust, 
swirling and dancing in the eddies 
and whirlpools of infinity. Life 
is eternal. We have stopped for a 
moment to encounter each other, 
to meet, to love, to share. This is 
a precious moment. It is a little 
parenthesis in eternity.” It’s hard 
to finish this book without feeling 
like you carry with you a new trove 
of secrets about the nature of the 
universe.

3. “On the Road” by Jack 

Kerouac / “Tangled Up in Blue” 
by Bob Dylan

I know this is cliché. I know, 

I know. Still, it’s hard to deny 
how beautifully ambitious, heady 
and breathlessly raucous “On 
the Road” is. Kerouac clearly 
articulates a youthful, bohemian 
longing for freedom: “There was 
nowhere to go but everywhere, so 
just keep on rolling under the stars. 
Nothing behind me, everything 
ahead of me, as is ever so on the 
road.” Kerouac is particularly 
popular among angsty college 
students, and I get why — he’s 
kind of a hipster, and so are his 
characters. The endless cigarettes, 
the messy hair, the moody nights 
spent drinking black coffee and 
writing poetry — can’t you imagine 
Timothée Chalamet playing Sal 
Paradise? There’s also something 
bittersweet about reading “On the 
Road” in 2018: Kerouac’s beatnik 
America is a place we cannot travel 
to outside of books and poetry. 
We’re lucky, then, that Kerouac is 
such a skilled tour guide, a fanatic 
host who, like us, is “desirous of 
everything at the same time.”

4. “In a Sunburned Country” 

by Bill Bryson / “Down Under” 
by Men at Work

I 
came 
away 
from 
this 

travelogue with two things. The 
first is that I want Bill Bryson to 
narrate my life. The second is 
that Australia seems like the most 
incredible, strange and beautiful 
place on Earth. Australia, Bryson 
says, “is at once staggeringly 
empty and yet packed with stuff. 
Interesting stuff, ancient stuff, 
stuff not readily explained. Stuff 
yet to be found.” It is so delightful 
to hear Bryson discuss all this 
stuff! Like Agatha Christie’s classic 
“Murder on the Orient Express,” 
a large part of the narrative of 
“In a Sunburned Country” takes 
place 
on 
a 
cross-continental 

train trip. Rather than murder, 
however, this trip is dominated by 
Bryson’s boundless curiosity and 
his extensive, detailed recollections 
of his own bumbling American 
ways. Bryson is uniquely talented 
at injecting humor into nearly every 
meandering tangent and anecdote 
about Australian history, and the 
experience of reading is one of 
complete immersion into a richly 
textured and singularly bizarre 
country.

BOOK NOTEBOOK

MIRIAM FRANCISCO

Daily Arts Writer

feebly unoriginal and monotonous, 
framing 
Sam 
and 
Abbie 
as 

simply “meant to be.” Posing 
their love as so eternally perfect 
consequentially makes it near 
impossible for viewers to interpret 
the relationship as genuine or 
believable. This bare-bones and 
over-idealized initial portrayal of 
Sam and Abbie establishes a one-
dimensional foundation and causes 
the first half of the movie to fall flat. 

Despite its rough start, the 

film progressively gains more 
momentum and finds moderate 
success in reviving audiences 
through the tension that emerges 
as a result of Abbie’s search for 
her own replacement. Though 
somewhat morbid and undeniably 
odd, the tension that Abbie’s 
efforts breed between her and 
Sam breaths a bit more life into 
the storyline, creating friction and 
directing the relationship away 

from its preliminary artificiality. 
Perhaps even more responsible for 
the recovery of the later portion 
of the film is the introduction of 
a new relationship: an oddball 
friendship between Abbie and 
Myron 
(Christopher 
Walken, 

“Seven Psychopaths”) — a father-
like, sardonic old man from 
Abbie’s cancer support group. The 
bond formed between these two 
unlikely friends over their illnesses 
adds a sprinkle of spunk and light 
humor that spices up the narrative. 
Myron and Abbie both maintain 
exceptionally “so-be-it” attitudes 
about their impending fates, not 
wasting time dwelling on the 
inevitable and instead exchanging 
pithy banter and enjoying each 
other’s company. 

The overall weakness of its story 

does not exactly set “Irreplaceable 
You” up to triumph. Ironically, 
this works out quite well because 

triumph is not this film’s intention. 
There is no insight offered and 
no 
profound 
message 
mulled 

over when the screen goes dark. 
However, despite its general lack 
of oomph, there is something 
commendable about the film’s 
ability to understand itself. This 
self-awareness comes from a clear 
comprehension of the audience, 
who for the most part is not 
looking to be blown away with 
emotion but rather just wants 
mild entertainment, a tinge of 
sorrow and a familiar narrative. 
Viewers get exactly what they 
expect with “Irreplaceable You.” 
Deficient of pomp, fluff and over-
dramatization, this film does not 
push too hard or dig too deep. 
It accepts the limitations of its 
plotline, conceals nothing from 
the audience and spares itself the 
embarrassment of striving to be 
more than it is.

Grounds crew makes impact for ‘M’

After every game, Michigan 

men’s lacrosse coach Kevin 
Conry gives “The Hammer” to 
the player who he deems made 
the most impact. But after 
the Wolverines’ win against 
Cleveland State on February 
10, the honor was given to Josh 
Fryd — the head of the grounds 
crew.

“We 
wouldn’t 
have 
had 

this game if it wasn’t for 
the 
unbelievable 
facility 

department,” 
Conry 
said. 

“(Junior 
attacker 
Brent) 

Noseworthy may have scored 
five goals, but those guys were 
the real MVPs.”

The 
grounds 
crew, 
who 

spent 48 hours plowing the 
field at U-M Lacrosse Stadium 
after Ann Arbor was hit with 
a terrible snowstorm, worked 
from five in the morning to 
seven at night.

Initially, 
the 
10-day 

forecast didn’t look to project 
anything too serious, but Fryd 
soon learned the hard way 
that Michigan’s weather is 
anything but predictable.

“I’m 
learning 
here 
in 

Southeast Michigan that the 

forecast can change in an 
instant,” he laughed.

Around seven in the morning, 

the team believed that the field 
was finally prepared, but the 
snow continued to fall from the 
cloudy skies above and didn’t 
let up for the rest of the day.

“They 
came 
out 
for 

warmups, and it kept snowing, 
so we had to start hand-
shoveling 
lines,” 
grounds 

crew plow driver Tony Pell 
said. “We plowed out as much 
as we could with the time we 
had left. It was challenging, 
but we had a bunch of people. 
Teamwork helped, and we got 
the job done.”

Pell, who has worked with 

the grounds crew for 15 years, 
is a valued member of the 
team, and his position helped 
to offer him a luxury that some 
of his fellow colleagues didn’t 
have access to — a plow that 
was both heated and allowed 
him to listen to music. 

“We’re 
lucky 
that 
the 

vehicles we have are heated,” 
Pell joked. 

Pell, who heard about the 

praise given to them by Conry 
after the game, was ecstatic. 

Fryd received a shoutout 

in 
the 
locker 
room 
from 

Conry after the win and even 
received the honor of “The 
Hammer.” Fryd appreciated 
the 
honor, 
but 
still 

acknowledged that the effort 
would not have been possible 
without the incredible work 
and determination of his team.

“The team that I am lucky 

enough to be a part of, to have 
on staff, the guys, they are 
amazing,” Fryd said. “I think 
I have some of the best guys in 
the country.”

Fryd feels that his unit is 

an incredibly tight-knit one, 
forming a unit that bonds over 
much more than their passion 
for working the fields.

“We’re a family,” Fryd said. 

“We probably spend more 
time together than we do with 
our own families.”

While they may not be 

playing on the field in front 
of the Wolverine faithful, the 
Michigan grounds crew is 
just as integral as any player 
who dons the maize and blue 
on gameday. Their uncanny 
ability to prepare the fields 
even in the face of a snowstorm 
is an effort that deserves to be 
noticed and celebrated.

“That makes it all worth it,” 

he said.

Senior night provides one last chance

Crisler Center is having senior 

night Thursday, as the Michigan 
women’s basketball team (9-6 Big 
Ten, 20-8 overall) takes on No. 13 
Maryland (11-3, 22-5).

It will be the last home game 

for senior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and senior forward Jillian Dunston. 
The matchup is best described by 
rapper Eminem’s Academy Award-
winning song “Lose Yourself.”

Look, if you had one shot, or one 

opportunity

To seize everything you ever 

wanted, in one moment

Would you capture it or just let it 

slip? Yo!

This is the Wolverines’ last 

chance to end the regular season on 
a positive note. They excelled at the 
start of the year and even reached 
No. 13 in the national rankings.

Michigan looked destined to 

make the NCAA Tournament 
early on. The team found multiple 
successes — including a road 
victory over then-No. 8 Ohio State 
— and was projected by ESPN to be 
a four seed in the Tournament in 
late January.

But things have taken a change 

of course since then. Michigan 
has lost four out of its last five 
contests, falling to Purdue, Rutgers, 
Michigan State and Minnesota — 
all opponents the Wolverines were 
expected to defeat.

Because of yet another end-of-

season collapse, the Wolverines 
find themselves on the bubble, and 
the game against the Terrapins is 
their last shot during the regular 
season to secure a spot.

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes 

gravity

The way things are going, 

Michigan could very well be 
disappointed come post season. 
If the Wolverines fail to make the 
NCAA Tournament it would indeed 
be a snap back to reality — the 
reality being that coach Kim Barnes 
Arico’s squad hasn’t qualified for 
the tournament since 2013.

He’s nervous, but on the surface 

he looks calm and ready

It makes sense for Michigan to 

be nervous. The offense has been 
unsteady during this rough stretch. 
Turnovers have been a problem all 

season, due to sloppy passes. In the 
upsets against the Scarlet Knights 
and the Spartans, the Wolverines 
committed 26 and 23 turnovers, 
respectively. And while Michigan 
had 16 turnovers in the recent loss 
against the Golden Gophers — less 
than the season average of 16.5 — 
they still came at the wrong time to 
the team’s detriment.

Last season, Maryland won 

the Big Ten Tournament, reached 
the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA 
Tournament and finished with a 
32-3 record. Though guards Kaila 
Charles and Kristen Confroy are 
their only returning starters, the 
Terrapins have continued to thrive 
this year.

“Maryland is a tremendous 

team,” Barnes Arico told WTKA.

Maryland is tied with the 

Buckeyes for first in the conference. 
The Terrapins have the highest 
scoring margin in the conference 
and are led by Charles, who 
averages 17.8 points.

“(She’s) just a great scorer around 

the rim,” Barnes Arico said. “Can 
face up, can play with her back to 
the basket.”

Sophomore guard Blair Watson 

and 
junior 
forward 
Eleanna 

Christinaki 
are 
also 
major 

contributors who average 13.8 and 
13.5 points, respectively.

Christinaki — who is from 

Athens, Greece — transferred 
from Florida. She became eligible 
to 
compete 
midway 
through 

December.

“She’s just a shooter, shooter, 

shooter, shooter, shooter,” Barnes 
Arico said.

Freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown sustained a leg injury in 
the loss to Michigan State and has 
been out ever since. She has been 
a starter all season, so her absence 
could cause the Wolverines to be 
even more nervous.

“We don’t think we’re probably 

gonna get her back this season, 
which is tough,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I mean, she’s a freshman for 
us that has had an outstanding, 
outstanding year. Was really kinda 
coming into her own here late in 
the season, playing with a lot of 
confidence.

“Nothing is torn, so really 

positive, positive news, but with the 
end of the season, in the next month 
— month and a half — she’s probably 
not gonna be able to return. So 
that’s tough.”

But the Terrapins have struggled 

recently too. Having lost to Purdue 
and Minnesota, they are now on a 
two-game losing streak. In a sense, 
Michigan is trying to keep calm and 
ready because of this, and wants to 
capitalize.

“They’re a team that’s kinda on a 

tough stretch right now too,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They’re beatable, and I 
think that’s what’s exciting, coming 
into this game.”

Maryland appears to have the 

upper hand, but the game is still 
critical for the Wolverines. Flaherty 
and Dunston have never been to the 
NCAA Tournament, so it will be 
interesting to see if they can make 
the most out of senior night by 
securing a spot.

Because after all, this opportunity 

comes once in a lifetime, yo.

Notebook: Disciplined defense fuels Wolverines in recent surge

During the last weekend of 

January, the Michigan hockey 
team 
suffered 
two 
straight 

defeats to Ohio State.

There are much worse things 

than going on the road and being 
swept by the sixth-ranked team 
in the country. But Wolverines 
coach Mel Pearson saw it slightly 
differently.

“At 
Ohio 
State 
we 
beat 

ourselves,” Pearson said Tuesday. 
“They’re a good team, I give them 
credit, they’ve got good players 
but we beat ourselves down 
there. … Giving (the puck) away 
too much and then being caught 
out of position defensively.”

Over 
Michigan’s 
last 
six 

games, 
however, 
the 
exact 

opposite has occurred. Since Feb. 
2, the Wolverines have given up 
exactly two goals per game, a 
display that Pearson attributes to 
“a little bit of everything.”

Last weekend’s series against 

then-No. 1 Notre Dame perhaps 
best encapsulates this. Michigan 
allowed two power-play goals 
on Friday and nothing else. 
Both contests seemed to follow 
a similar script — the Wolverines 
came out on fire, controlling the 
puck in the Fighting Irish zone, 
and then calmly settled back 
in front of their own net after 
gaining the lead, absorbing Notre 
Dame’s 
desperate 
attacking 

efforts with disciplined team 
defense.

“I 
think 
we’re 
managing 

the puck better — by that, I 
mean we’re controlling it in the 
offensive zone, we’re playing 
with it more,” Pearson said. “In 
our defensive zone we’re doing a 
much better job of our defensive 
zone system, and that’s allowed 
us not to give up as many grade-A 
chances. It’s just better overall 
team defense which starts in 
net and it starts with our play 
with the puck. We’re managing, 
holding on to it and possessing it 

more.”

The 
mistakes 
Michigan 

made 
against 
the 
Buckeyes 

never reared their ugly heads 
against 
the 
Fighting 
Irish, 

signaling the latest step in the 
full implementation of Pearson’s 
overall offensive and defensive 
system.

“We’re not beating ourselves,” 

Pearson said. “Our risk-reward 
— we’re picking our spots when 
to get on the offensive side of the 
puck. Before we were just selling 
out offensively with turnovers 
and we’d get trapped. I don’t 
think Notre Dame — I don’t know 
if they had any two-on-ones — 
we’re giving up a limited number 
of odd number rushes.”

Added 
junior 
defenseman 

Joseph Cecconi: “We always 
preach playing the right side of 
the puck, playing the defensive 

side because that creates offense. 
If you’re playing good defense, 
you’re probably playing good 
offense.”

New Big Ten Tournament 

format

Michigan’s 
win 
in 
South 

Bend on Friday, coupled with 
Michigan State defeating Penn 
State, would have been just 
another night in the Big Ten — 
albeit a very significant one — if it 
had taken place a year ago.

Instead, Friday’s results locked 

the Wolverines into hosting 
the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament. Unlike the format 
from previous seasons, which 
took place over a single weekend 
at a neutral location, this year’s 
conference 
tournament 
is 
a 

three-week event that will take 
place at campus sites.

“Yost Ice Arena — when it 

gets rocking it’s a home ice 
advantage. This Sunday proved 
that,” Pearson said. “We’re a 
better team at home. It’s going to 
be tough wherever you play, but 
it’s really important that you get 
home ice and you get that crowd 
behind you. It’s like you start at 
one-nothing.”

For 
Pearson, 
nothing’s 

changed. Last season, he coached 
Michigan Tech to a victory in 
the WCHA Tournament, which 
followed almost the exact same 
format.

“I thought it was outstanding,” 

Pearson said. “... The crowds were 
great and I remember Bowling 
Green in the last game saying 
they couldn’t believe it — sold-
out building, great atmosphere 
for both teams, and that’s what 
you’re trying to get instead of 
playing in a 15, 16 thousand seat 

building where you get three 
thousand people. We’re trying to 
create that atmosphere in the Big 
Ten and I think it’s a great move.”

There are a few changes to 

the system that Pearson would 
like to see. While the first round 
is a best-of-three series, the 
semifinal and final rounds are 
both single games.

In the seven-team tournament, 

the top seed — Notre Dame — has 
a bye for the first round, meaning 
that if it lost its semifinal game, 
it 
would 
enter 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament 
having 
played 

only once in nearly a month — a 
disadvantageous situation that 
Pearson would like to guard 
against.

“I’ll put my two cents in this 

year,” Pearson said. “I think it 
will be this spring in April when 
we have the Big Ten hockey 

meetings. It’ll come up again, 
I’m going to bring it up and then 
(Notre Dame coach Jeff) Jackson 
will bring it up.”

A deceptive test
The Wolverines came into last 

weekend with an all-or-nothing 
mentality. Failing to earn points 
of any kind against the Fighting 
Irish would have been a serious, 
while not fatal, blow to their 
hopes at securing an at-large bid 
in the NCAA Tournament.

Instead, Michigan shot up to 

No. 11 in the Pairwise rankings, 
and according to College Hockey 
News, it possesses a 95 percent 
chance of qualifying for the 
postseason. The Wolverines are 
safely in the field — for now.

This weekend’s regular-season 

finale against Arizona State is by 
no means challenging, per se. 
The Sun Devils, in just their third 
season as a fully-fledged Division 
I team, rank 55th out of 60 teams 
in Pairwise.

But at this time of year, 

opponents such as Arizona State 
can be even scarier than teams 
like Notre Dame. For all that was 
gained last weekend, Michigan 
falling on its face against the Sun 
Devils — the weakest team on its 
schedule — would take that all 
away, and then some.

“Last weekend was huge for 

us, winning against Notre Dame, 
but if we can’t keep focused this 
weekend it’s all for nothing,” 
said sophomore forward Adam 
Winborg. “We have to come out 
and play our best hockey again.”

Of course, Arizona State is 

No. 55 in Pairwise for a reason. 
Losing even one of the next two 
games is far from likely. But don’t 
tell the Wolverines that.

“We have to treat Arizona 

State like a No. 1 team,” Cecconi 
said. “If we don’t beat them twice 
that’s going to hurt us big time in 
the Pairwise. We have to prepare 
basically just like any other 
game, any other Big Ten game. It 
might be these two games are the 
most important for our season.”

Michigan fends off early second-half run, takes down Penn State, 72-63

Jordan Poole cocked his arm 

back and the Bryce Jordan Center 
crowd gasped.

The freshman guard finished 

the fastbreak dunk with a flush, 
putting 
Penn 
State 
forward 

Julian Moore on a poster and 
sending the Michigan men’s 
basketball team well on its 
way to a statement win, as the 
17th-ranked 
Wolverines 
(12-5 

Big Ten, 23-7 overall) took down 
a resurgent Penn State, 72-63 
Wednesday night.

And just for a little effect, the 

always-affable Poole turned and 
mean-mugged the camera. It 
was the look of a freshman guard 
who was more than happy to ruin 
Senior Night in State College.

“I definitely knew the camera 

was right there,” Poole joked 
after the game.

Once 
again 
Poole 
lifted 

Michigan with a much-needed 
offensive spark, finishing with 
13 points on 4-of-8 shooting. 
Once again, the Wolverines’ 
defense carried them to a big 
win. And once again, Michigan 
showed signs of peaking as the 
Big Ten and NCAA Tournament 
approach.

“I think (Poole is) heading in 

the right direction, that’s for sure, 
of what winning basketball really 
looks like,” Beilein said. “Part of 
that is really making simple plays. 
… He’s sort of learning what to do 
at the right times. But he’s got so 
much swag to him, we can teach 
the other stuff. He’s got so much 
confidence, we can teach the 
other stuff. We can’t teach his 
DNA right now.”

It wasn’t always as smooth 

as the charismatic freshman 
made it seem, though, especially 
offensively.

Michigan 
turned 
the 
ball 

over five times in its first eight 
possessions, but kept the Nittany 
Lions (9-8, 19-11) largely in 
check on the other end thanks 
to strong post defense. Penn 
State seemed content letting 
redshirt sophomore wing Charles 

Matthews, who finished the 
game with zero points and three 
turnovers, attack off the dribble. 
That plan was effective early 
on, prompting Beilein to turn to 
freshman guard Jordan Poole and 
fifth-year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson 
to 

spark the offense.

Both 

responded 
emphatically.

First, Robinson 

dotted a 3-pointer 
in the face of 
his 
defender. 

Then he cut on 
the 
baseline, 

catching a laser 
pass and laying 
it in. Two possessions later, he 
pump-faked his defender and 
pulled up for a smooth, mid-
range jumper.

Robinson 
paced 
the 

Wolverines in the half, scoring 12 
points of his team-high 19 points 
in the frame.

Poole added a 3-pointer and a 

lay-in to his highlight reel dunk 
for eight points of his own in the 

first half. 

But 
the 

Nittany 
Lions 

wouldn’t go down 
without a fight. 
They started the 
second half with 
a jumper from 
star guard Tony 
Carr, a 3-pointer 
from 
forward 

Lamar 
Stevens 

and 
another 

three from Carr. The barrage 
continued, with 10 unanswered 
points in total to grad a 41-38 
lead.

Carr, in particular, grabbed 

the reigns of the previously 
sputtering Penn State offense and 
did his part to rejuvenate it. The 
Big Ten scoring leader finished 
with 21 points on 18 shots, but 
ultimately couldn’t get enough 
support to turn the tide for good.

“We just knew what he was 

capable of doing. He’s a great 
point guard in the Big Ten,” said 
sophomore point guard Zavier 
Simpson, the man tasked with 
guarding Carr for the majority of 
Wednesday’s game. “He’s putting 
up great numbers and leading his 
team to victories. So me being 
the starting point guard for my 
team, I just wanted to come 
in with a defensive mindset to 
make it contagious. He hit some 
good shots, but I think, overall, 
we played some pretty good 
defense.”

From 18:36 to 13:38 of the 

second half, Michigan failed to 
score, offering grim flashbacks 
to road comeback losses at 
Northwestern and Ohio State, 
prompting Beilein to call timeout.

“We seemed like we were tired 

and didn’t want 
to play with the 
same conviction 
we did in the 
first half,” Beilein 
said. “I can’t tell 
you the timeout 
worked, but in the 
last 12 minutes 
we played with a 
lot of conviction.”

With 

Michigan’s back 
against 
the 
walls, 
suddenly 

trailing on the road and in need 
of a basket, junior center Moritz 
Wagner answered the call. With 

the shot clock winding down, 
Wagner nailed a corner three, 
tying the game back up. He 
followed that up with another 
crowd-silencing 
three 
two 

possessions later, wrestling the 
lead back to the Wolverines. 

“Those 
two 
buckets 
were 

definitely 
huge,” 
Poole 
said. 

“Obviously we couldn’t get shots 
to fall. Obviously, the momentum 
was swinging their way. But he’s 
a big-time player — he’s been here 
making big-time shots this year 
and last year.

Wagner finished with 18 points 

and 8 rebounds.

The teams traded haymakers 

as the game headed towards 
its dawn — a Reaves three, an 
Abdur-Rahkman answer. A Poole 
three, a Carr jumper.

It was Robinson who would 

throw 
the 
knockout 
punch, 

blocking two key shots at the rim 
and nailing a transition 3-pointer 
to extend the lead to nine with 
just 1:28 left.

“I just feel a little bit more 

engaged when I step on the floor,” 
Robinson said. “These are the 
final minutes and games of my 
college career. I’m trying to make 
it all count.”

In the end, with the defense 

doing its part to hold Penn State 
in check, Michigan held its slim 
lead for the final 12:04 of the 
game.

And yet, with a 12th conference 

win in tow and just a game left 
in the regular season, Bryce 

Jordan 
Center 

wasn’t the place 
for macroscopic 
reflection on the 
season. That time 
will come.

This is a team 

continuing 
to 

improve at the 
time of year that 
is paramount.

“The 

expectation 

is we’re going to keep getting 
better,” Beilein said. “If that’s 
our rule of thumb, we are getting 
better.”

Wagner finds Michigan’s answer

Early in the second half, the 

“Wagner” chants returned.

It 
was 
reminiscent 
of 

Michigan’s 
January 
trip 
to 

Nebraska. The Wolverines lost 
by 20 in Lincoln, and Wagner — 
opposing crowds’ favorite guy to 
heckle — struggled mightily.

Back then, the junior forward 

had no comeback for the taunts. 
He 
was 
frustrated 
by 
the 

Cornhuskers all night, and at 
the end of the contest, he sat 
quietly on the bench as the crowd 
chanted his name. Nebraska 
trounced Michigan.

Wednesday, the Wolverines 

were in danger of something 
similar. But this time, Wagner 
had an answer.

It was after he had been 

blocked on a layup attempt by 
Penn State’s Lamar Stevens, 
leading to an and-one to put the 
Nittany Lions on top. Michigan’s 
eight-point halftime lead had 
evaporated. Two minutes later, 
Stevens threw down an alley-oop 
to increase the lead to three, and 
the Bryce Jordan Center broke 
out the Wagner chants.

The 
Wolverines 
looked 

helpless on offense. Michigan 
coach John Beilein admitted he 
was frustrated with that side of 
the ball at the time.

The next possession didn’t 

look much better. The shot 
clock was trickling down, and 
the Wolverines still couldn’t 
find their flow. Senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman probed into the lane 
and kicked it out to Wagner with 
five on the clock. The junior rose 
up from the right corner and tied 
the game with a three.

With just over 12 minutes to 

go, Wagner did it again off a pick-
and-pop to give Michigan its 
lead back. The Wolverines never 
trailed again, winning 72-63.

“During that situation, we 

just look to try to get a good 
shot,” said sophomore guard 
Zavier Simpson. “Moe had big 
enough balls to take them, so we 
appreciate him. He made them, 
and we’re glad for that. It kind 
of settled us down and made us 

enjoy the situation of us being 
up. We took advantage of it. So 
we were proud of that, and a big 
shoutout to Moe for knocking 
those shots down.”

Added Beilein: “(We had) very 

poor direction at that time. … 
Usually in the second half, I can 
help them with that. ... He got 
open, luckily, and he made them 
both, and now, all of the sudden, 
it’s a one-point game, and now 
we’re back playing.”

It was that kind of shooting 

that 
sealed 
the 
game 
for 

Michigan. Wagner finished the 
game 4-for-5 from deep with 18 
points. Fifth-year senior forward 
Duncan Robinson went 3-for-6 
from beyond the arc and finished 
with 19 points.

Both hit clutch 

shots when the 
Wolverines 
needed 
them. 
Beilein 

complimented 
how 
they 

“don’t 
have 
a 

conscience.”

That’s 

especially 
important 
for 

Wagner.

He knows he draws the ire of 

opposing crowds wherever he 
goes, and Michigan struggled on 
the road early in the season.

Wagner 
somewhat 
relishes 

the 
villain 
role 
though, 
as 

he’s shooting 46% from three 

in 
opposing 
arenas. 
It’s 
a 

phenomenon 
he 
can’t 
really 

explain, just like he can’t explain 
why he’s the center of road 
crowds’ attention.

“For some reason they hate 

me everywhere, but I just play 
honestly,” Wagner said. “I don’t 
think about that type of stuff. 
Last year, I remember people 
asking me why my shooting 
numbers were so low on the road. 
Now it’s the other way around. 
If you know me, I don’t look like 
I’m not enjoying this out there. I 
definitely have fun, and it’s cool.”

It’s a unique perspective for 

sure.

It would be easy to crumble 

under the pressure knowing that 

13,000 
people 

are dying to see 
you get your shot 
blocked or turn 
the 
ball 
over. 

They’d revel in 
any 
frustration 

at all.

They 
loved 

it in Lincoln. It 
was the sideshow 
to 
the 
game, 

as 
the 
student 

section pestered Wagner into 
submission.

But despite the same chant 

raining down on the court and the 
other team threatening a similar 
run to put the Wolverines away, 
there was one, key difference.

Wagner had an answer.
