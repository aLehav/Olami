Sexual assault survivors

University president
follows up after his
Monday remarks

After delivering candid com-
ments regarding University
athletics at Monday afternoon's
meeting of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs, University President
Mark Schlissel spoke with The
Michigan Daily by phone Tues-
day evening to clarify his state-
ments.
Schlissel arranged the inter-
view through the University's
Office of Public Affairs after a
story Monday resulted in both
praise and criticism of the presi-
dent's frank assessment of the
University's Athletic Depart-
ment. In Tuesday's interview,
he addressed three points:
admission standards for ath-
letes, the Athletic Department's
compliance with countable
practice hours, and its relatIn-
ship with English Prof. Anne

Curzan, who serves as faculty
liaison to the department.
Academic Performance
At Monday's SACUA meet-
ing, Schlissel said, "We admit
students who aren't as quali-
fied, and it's probably the kids
that we admit that can't hon-
estly, even with lots of help, do
the amount of work and the
quality of work it takes to make
progression from year to year.
These past two years have got-
ten better, but before that, the
graduation rates were terrible,
with football somewhere in
the 50s and 60s when our total
six-year rate at the University is
somewhere near 90 percent."
Schlissel told the Daily
on Tuesday that all students
are admitted by the Office of
Admissions, not by athletic
programs or coaches. He said
this process includes a holistic
review of an applicant's quali-
fications, including grades, test
scores and special talents, such
as athletic ability.
"We don't admit students

Speak Out event
encourages
attendees to take
action in community
By LINDSEY SCULLEN
Daily StaffReporter
About 300 people filled the
* Michigan Union's Rogel Ball-
room Tuesday night for the

Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center's 28th Annual
Speak Out - one of the largest
Speak Outs to date. Speak Out is
an annual event aimed to offer
survivors of sexual violence a safe
place to share their stories.
The Speak Out recognized
rape, sexual assault, stalking,
sexual harassment and intimate
partner crimes as "sexual vio-
lence." LSA senior Katelyn Mad-
dock, co-coordinator of SAPAC's
Networking, Publicity, and Activ-

ism Program, said in her intro-
duction that this definition is not
exhaustive.
Maddock and her co-coordina-
tor, LSA junior Anna Forringer-
Beal, also assured attendees that
the event was a "strictly confiden-
tial space."
Survivors were then given the
floor. All was silent at first. In
time, a survivor stepped up to the
microphone.
In the past, University staff
and employees attending these

events have been required to
report incidents of sexual vio-
lence in all situations. However,
the University's Office for institu-
tional Equity now allows Univer-
sity staff and employees to attend
public awareness events and
events like Speak Out without
having any obligation to report
incidents to the University.
"Sexual violence isn't some-
thing that's talked about a lot,"
said University alum Lindsay

CAMPUS LIFE

LGBTQ history

Former service
members address lack
of legal protection,
cultural stigma
By JOEL GOLDSTEIN
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's ROTC pro-
gram hosted a series of events
this week honoring servicemen
and women in honor of Veteran's
Day. One such event sought to
shed light on what life is like for
LGBTQ military members, and
Ariana Bostian-Kentes and Brian
Stone were invited to the Wolver-
ine Room of the Michigan Union
to speak about their experiences.
Stone served in the United
States Navy when the "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" policy was imple-
mented - a law that prohibited
discrimination based on sexual-
orientation but also disallowing

LGBTQ individuals from serv-
ing openly in the military - and
Bostian-Kentes is the program
manager for inclusive leader-
ship education at the University's
Spectrum Center. She is also
the co-founder of the Military
Partners and Families Coalition,
a nonprofit organization that
serves LGBTQ soldiers and their
families.
Though the legislation was
officially repealed in 2011, Stone
said he and many others thought
that DADT would be revoked
sooner after President Obama
took office. Stone added that
the policy required LGBTQ sol-
diers and their partners to lie on
federal documents and to their
co-workers. Before the repeal,
same-sex partners of those in the
military did not the same ben-
efits that spouses in heterosexual
relationships received.
Stone also recalled the dif-
ficulties those in the military

PRESENTATION BORN TO iKE
Police campaign for new bike lanes

A new campaign spearheaded
by Michigan State University
Police is creating a conversation
between students and police
about the lack of bike lanes on
campus, The State News reported
last Sunday.
MSU Police Lieutenant Randy
Holton emphasized the impor-
tance of bikers complying with
motorist practices when bike
lanes are not available.
According to Holton, the most
common accidents on campus
are those in which a cyclist rides
through a crosswalk and makes
contact with a vehicle. He also
blamed motorists and pedestri-
ans for not paying attention when
traveling through campus.

Panelists say
national policy
worsened after 9/11
By JOEL GOLDSTEIN
Daily Staff Reporter
The topic of immigration has
evolved throughout U.S. his-
tory, though never lacking in
complexity and contentiousness
Social Work Profs. Sherrie Kos-
soudji and Laura Sanders took
up the subject on Tuesday, lead-
ing a discussion on U.S. immi-
gration reform.
The panel discussion was
hosted by the groups Common
Sense Action and Social Work
Allies for Immigrant Rights.
Kossoudji and Sanders, who are
activists for immigrants' rights
in the Ann Arbor community,
spoke about -the "push factors"
that motivate people to cross

the borders without documen-
tation.
"It's really important for us to
learn about the issues that cre-
ate the world around us, espe-
cially because you don't get the
whole story on CNN," said LSA
sophomore Daniel Karr, vice
president of policy for Common
Sense Action.
Sanders said immigration
policy took a turn for the worse
after 9/11, following the estab-
lishment of the Department of
Homeland Security, referring to
what many say are violent and
dehumanizing detention and
deportation tactics enforced
on the undocumented immi-
grant community. According to
national reports, 369,000 depor-
tations took place in 2013.
Sanders is a co-founder of the
Washtenaw Interfaith Coali-
tion for Immigrant Rights, an
activist group that represents
immigrants and works to ensure

that they are treated fairly and
within their rights. The group
maintains an open phone line
to help people who are facing
abuse, detention or deportation.
The group also provides educa
rtional programs for immigrants
to make sure they know their
rights.
Sanders said the organization
has received more than 526 calls
over the past six yeais. WICIR
has also worked with the local
government and sheriff to create
a more humane environment for
undocumented immigrants in
the community. Sanders empha-
sized that new national immi-
gration policies have begun to
favor tough border security as
opposed to legal pathways.
"There's a real necessity for
legal pathways for the millions
of people who are here right
now," Sanders said.
She also said the immigration
system that is designed to house

Author discusses
what he sees as link
between capitalism
and imperialism
By EMMA KINERY
DailyStaffReporter
On Tuesday night, the Inter-
nationalYouth and Students for
Social Equality hosted "Impe-
rialism and the World Wars of
the Twentieth Century: His-
torical Lessons and Present
Dangers," a lecture by David
North, the national chairman
of the Socialist Equality Party
in the United States and the
chairman of the International
Editorial Board of the World
Socialist Web Site.
The event, which coinciden-
tally fell on the anniversary
of the signing of the armistice
to end World War I, was one
of 11 occurring in universi-
ties across the United States.
North said his goal in partici-
pating in the lecture series is
to "contribute to the education
of students and the explana-
tion of the basic principles of
socialism analysis made by the
Socialist Equality Party of the
political situation within the
United States and international
(countries)."
North focused on how
he believes capitalism and
the imperialist strategies he
associated with it lead to the
world wars, drawing paral-
lels between the strategies
and goals of the capitalist

world before World War I and
those of today, warning of an
approaching world war. He
started the talk by questioning
the crowd of their knowledge
of how World War I began and
arguing that it was not an acci-
dent or a response to-an assas-
sination.
While the assassination of
Archduke Franz Ferdinand
of Austria triggered the war,
North said even at the Inter-
national Hague Conference of
1907 "it was very well under-
stood that there was an inde-
scribable link between war and
capitalism."
"There was a sense, that
without the intervention of
world groups, political orga-
nizing and socialist move-
ments, not only was war
possible; it was inevitable," he
said.
North went on to say it was
and still is important for the
international workers' move-
ment to actively rally against
war, and that if war is to break
out, the working class and
socialists must work to "bring
it to a speedy termination."
North argued WWI was
instead a "preemptive" war
that Germany chose to wage
to demonstrate its hegemo-
ny. Comparing events such
as the contemporary arms
races, the recent emergence of
one between--nations in Asia
and the militarization that
occurred prior to World War I,
North argued that the believed
link between capitalism and
war is still true today.
He pointed to several events

that have occurred this month
that he said show how close we
are to an accidental war and
how capitalist countries are
leaving Russia and China out
of trade organizations to create
a new and - in his opinion -
dangerous world order.
North ended his lecture by
urging students to learn more
about socialist theory, saying
he feels that the only way to
prevent this World War III is
through the collaboration of
the working class.
The audience mainly con-
sisted of older individuals,
with a few students who only
voiced their opinions during
the question and answer ses-
sion that followed.
Audience members ques-
tioned the validity of North's
strong belief in an approaching
World War III and his com-
ments that neither Russia nor
China is an imperialist nation.
Art & Design sophomore
Wake Coulter, who had previ-
ous interest in learning more
about the socialist movement
on campus and in World War
I's influence on today's politics,
said he was glad to see there
are people who are passionate
about history and how it can
affect today's world.
"There's still an active sec-
tion of even modern society
that is very much not forgetting
the benefits and also the down-
sides of the social movements
of the early 1900s, and I think
that those can have a really
profound effect on today's poli-
tics if we took a deeper look at
them," he said.

permanent residents and the
non-immigrant visitor system
began to merge in the '70s and
'80s, leading to the complicated
bureaucracy we have today.
"If you were to become legal
citizen today, you probably
started around 1992, because of
7 9 2 1 8 how long the waiting lists are,"
Kossoudji said.
At the end of the lecture, Kos-
 9 soudji explained the benefits
Americans gain from allowing
T9 2 immigrants to enter the country.
According to Kossoudji, undoc-
3 7umented immigrants tend to
make less than minimum wage,
doing jobs that Americans don't
want to do, which pushes down
prices throughout the economy.

SAPAC
From Page lA
Walker, an attendee. "I think
that U of M, having SAPAC as a
resource, is really progressive
compared to a lot of other univer-
sities in that it supports talking
about it and having resources for
students to go to."
Walker, who currently works
at Planned Parenthood, joined
SAPAC as a sophomore at the Uni-
versity after hearing about it from
a friend she met in class - the
same friend who sat next to her
Tuesday at the Speak Out.
"It was just a really good expe-
rience for me," she said.
In addition to providing survi-
vors with a safe place to discuss their

experiences, Maddock said Speak
Outencouragespeopletotakeaction.
"When you come to events like
these, you realize that behind
every number, behind every sta-
tistic, is a person, a person who has
a face and a story that's uniquely
theirs," Forringer-Beal said.
Action comes in different
forms, she added. It could mean
volunteering with SAPAC, orga-
nizing events, working at Safe
House Center, an organization
that offers support to survivors of
sexual assault and domestic vio-
lence, working on public policy or
court cases,journaling or produc-
ing artthat "breaksthe silence."
Maddock added that calling out
those who joke about assault is
also an action to counteract nega-
tive influences.

"Every time you challenge
those mentalities, you're chang-
ing something," Maddock said.
Rackham student Ali Chet-
wynd, who donned a pink heart
on his shirt, is a volunteer for the
Networking, Publicity, and Activ-
ism Volunteer Program. He wel-
comed visitors to the event as a
doorman and ensured that survi-
vors sharing their stories were not
interrupted by the opening and
closing of the door.
Chetwynd said Speak Out is a
unique SAPAC event.
"This is just one of those events
where SAPAC itself is essentially
silent. This is an event where peo-
ple, survivors themselves, are able
to come and speak out," he said.
"One ofthe important things about
this is that it's a space dedicated

purely for them to speak, be heard
and recognize themselves in other
people on campus aswell."
In addition to Speak Out,
SAPAC has other forums that
work to counter sexual violence
on campus. They have a dialogue
series that gives targeted com-
munities, such as those of people
of color and the LGBTQ commu-
nity, an opportunity to share their
stories.
"We really just want to get
the message across that SAPAC
is here, we have resources for
people, and we're here for the
students," Forringer-Beal said.
"We'll do everything we can."

been reversed, including official
requests that service members

wouldn't be sleeping or bathing

He also noted that while there
was a lot of anxiety about the
logistics of military members
outwardly acknowledging their
identities, there were almost no
questions about the effectiveness
of LGBTQ soldiers.

students in a brand-new environ-

pick students that will be success-

with the academic support they
need to be successful."
Schlissel said the University
previously struggled with pro-
moting strong academic perfor-
mance for student-athletes, but in
recent years, particularly under
Michigan Football Coach Brady
Hoke, the University has been
more proactive with academic
success programs. Schlissel said
initial performance data indicates
the University could expect to see
further improvements in the next
few years.
Hoke, in response, noted his
team's commitment to academics
during Tuesday's weekly Big Ten
coaches' teleconference.
"The thing we're proud of since
we've been here, is that all 69 of
the 69 seniors we've had have
graduated," Hoke said. "Our APR
(Academic Progress Rate) num-
ber is the highest it has ever been.
We really look at, in recruiting, we
want to get guys who are academi-
cally able to succeed and do the
work. We want the best football
players and the best people."
At Hoke's 12:08 p.m. slot to
speak, he said he had not been
in contact with Schlissel since
his initial meeting earlier in the
year. Schlissel told the Daily on
Tuesday that he had apologized to

The audience included a hand-

and humanities, and students from
each field expressed a need for
more and better research oppor-
tunities. They discussed a lack of
such opportunities for students
not qualifying for the Undergradu-
ate Research Opportunity Pro-
gram and similar programs that
target newer students, as well as a
lack of opportunities for students
majoring in the humanities.
"I think one of the things
that we've done historically well
through a variety of programs is
getting students involved in facul-
ty research early and often," Mar-

adversity transgender soldiers
still face. For example he said,
transgender soldiers are not pro-
tected legally and can be fired for
identifying as transgender. Stone
cited an instance when a trans-
gender corpsman wore clean nail
polish on her toes and was brought
to a superior, even though the mili-
tary had no rules regarding toenail
polish.
"As far as I remember, Ameri-
canmilitaryhaven'truninto battle
barefoot in avery longtime," Stone
said.
He said he feels no one cares
about how transgender soldiers
aretreatedinthemilitary. Because
most of the effort by activists was
put toward making it so gay and
lesbian soldiers could serve openly
in the military, Stone said there is
very little political will to improve
treatment for transgender soldiers.
Bostian-Kentes shared a differ-
ent perspective after entering into
a relationship with a member ofthe
armed forces who was deployed to
Afghanistan in the early 2000s.
She recalled the difficulty she had
getting in touch with her partner,

not wanting to arouse suspicion
that the two were in a relationship.
"Whenever I sent her a picture,
I made sure there was a man in it,"
Bostian-Kentes said.
While her partner was serv-
ing, Bostian-Kentes joined anony-
mous online forums used by other
people whose partners were serv-
ing in the military. Eventually, the
support group was contacted by
the Pentagon and asked to come to
Washington, D.C. Bostian-Kentes
said she spoke to U.S. Army Gen-
eral Carter Ham about the difficul-
ties she and others faced, and that
the general eventually suggested
thatthe militaryend DADT.
Bostian-Kentes felt that the
pressure to not be seen or pho-
tographed hurt her relationship
with her partner. She pointed to
that stress as one of the central
reasons that she and her partner
eventually ended their relation-
ship. Bostian-Kentes said the
stress for LGBTQ soldiers still
exists today, explaining how she
feels when soldiers and their
families need help, it is often pro-
vided by chaplains who are some-

times members of religions that
oppose homosexuality.
"Imagine trying to get help
from someone who thinks of you
as an abomination," Bostian-
Kentes said.
Despite the adversity they
have faced, both speakers still
actively support the U.S. military
and its troops. Stone is a member
of a military family that has sent
members into almost every U.S.
war since the American Revolu-
tion. Bostian-Kentes started a
new relationship with a member
of the Michigan National Guard
and the two made the decision to
come out when Bostian-Kentes'
partner was promoted to the
rank of captain.
"I'm thankful that we get
the chance to hear from these
remarkable folks," said Engi-
neering freshman Jake Biegger,
who attended the talks. "I would
say that anyone who serves in
the military is inspiring, and for
members of the LGBTQ commu-
nity to do it through such adver-
sity is a testament to their love for
their country."

STARTUP
From Page 1A

"We have, a really thriving
entrepreneurial community
around U of M and we have a
lot of resources to support it,"
Kerecman added. "I think it says
a lot about the student initia-
tive."
Competitions to facilitate
the partnership of investors
and later-stage startups. The
focus helps to create business
networks and grow promising
local ideas, benefiting the state
- hence the "Accelerate Michi-
gan" title. At the end of the
event, which is separated into
rounds, the organization awards
a collective $1 million to 10 new
businesses.
Four of the 10 teams receiving
prize money have roots at the
University.
SkySpecs, LLC took the grand
prize of $500,000. SkySpecs is
working toward improving the
safety of drones, which often
crash to the ground, through
technology they call "Sense and
Avoid," said University alum
Sam Debruin, SkySpecs chief
operating officer.
This technology allows
drones to better avoid obstacles
and operate more safely while
also increasing economic effi-
ciency. The technology is being
developed in two of the start-
ups' products: the Guardian, a
"co-pilot" that completely takes
over flight control when a colli-
sion is likely, and the Wingman,
which allows the pilot to priori-
tize missions by automating the
complexities of flight.
"Drones are about to be
everywhere," Debruin said. "For
us, to be drone people and really
think of ourselves as shepherds'
of this industry, we saw a colli-
sion point coming where drones

are getting more and more pop-
ular, but the safety aspects are
really keeping pace with the
flight aspects."
Debruin graduated from the
University in 2012 with a degree
in computer engineering and is
currently pursuing a Ph.D. in
computer science engineering.
He said considering the ways
in which drone technology can
change the world became a top
priority.
SkySpecs was accompanied
at the competition by a variety
of software and online websites.
Cribspot, a website that acts as
a marketplace for student hous-
ing in college towns around the
country, has amassed more than
60,000 users as of late Septem-
ber.
The website, founded by
2013 University graduates Evan
Dancer, Tim Jones and Jason
Okrasinski, took second place
and received $100,000.
Okrasinski said the goal of
the company continues to be
improving the transparency of
what's available in terms of stu-
dent housing.
"There's a huge emphasis on
mobile apps and being able to do
everything on the go," Okrasin-
ski said. "We're moving towards
a more flawless mobile experi-
ence and working to build that
up."
Okrasinski said the Universi-
ty has recently pushed entrepre-
neurship and its students have
become more enthusiastic about
taking chances with their own
ideas. Okrasinski cited the Uni-
versity's new entrepreneurship
minor, the influx of innovation-
focused funds and the ways in
which courses incorporate guid-
ance from established startup
founders.
"When we started Cribspot, it
would have been hard to imag-
ine all of this enthusiasm around
startups," Okrasinski said.


Athletic Director Jim Hackett to
convey an apology to coaches of
all of the University's sports.
"I did talk to Coach Hoke today,
and I apologized to him for really
not providing a full picture of all
things all our teams - and foot-
ball for sure - and our coaches do
to support our student-athletes -
and nooiust-i-ntheir athletlnerm ,
but in their roles as students,"
Schlissel said.
"I also had a discussion today
with our interim A.D., Jim Hack-
ett, and I asked Jim to convey
those same thoughts to the other
coaches and their teams, because
I was concerned that I may have
misrepresented things in a way
that didn't do justice to how hard
our student-athletes work and
how much support they get from
their coaches and the academic
advisingstaff."
Athletic Director's role
in hiring a new coach
In response to a question from
the Daily, Schlissel clarified his
comments from Monday regard-
ing his process in hiring a new
athletic director and his role in
determining Hoke's future.
"That's why I'm taking a bit of
time with the search for Dave's
successor," Schlissel said Mon-
day. "Some folks wanted me to
hire an athletic director (earlier)
so he could fire the current foot-
ball coach and hire the next coach
but I want to take the time to
make sure we get someone who
is not only technically adept, but
can ensure that the program has
financial and academic integrity,
and also someone who shares the
value system of realizing our mis-

slon."
On Tuesday, Schlissel said he
was paraphrasing the large num-
ber of e-mails from Michigan
fans, including those regarding
the Wolverines football program.
"With the football team having
a challenging year, some of that
advice speaks to the head coach.
As I said earlerin the-season,-ll-
of our coaches will be evaluated at
the end of the season on their full
body of work and that will be done
by the athletic director," he said.
"What I was referring to was
the quote, which was accurately
quoted but wasn't clearly stated
by me, is that there are people say-
ing, 'You gotta do this, you gotta
do this. But what I say back is,
it's actually very important - the
personnel that we have in place
- and I want to hire an outstand-
ing permanent athletic director.
I don't want to do the quick easy
thing that some peopl'e are call-
ing for, and that no decision has
been made about the future of
the coach and that's the athletic
director's decision, almost cer-
tainly, at the end of the season."
NCAA compliance rules
Schlissel said the Athletic
Department is fully compliant
with NCAA regulations that limit
the number of countable hours for
which a student-athlete may par-
ticipate in organized team activi-
ties. What he was trying to convey
Monday, Schlissel said, was that
student-athletes often spend far
longer than the weekly 20-hour
limit by participating in non-
countable activities such as travel,
medical rehabilitation, voluntary
workouts and other voluntary

activities.
"If I could wave my magic
wand and really change things for
these student-athletes, I would.
The NCAA says 20.5 hours is the
max, but it turns out nobody fol-
lows that," Schlissel said Monday.
"There are ways that they work
around it and if it was only us, it'd
be ridiculous, I'de-lean-house, but
it's everybody."
Faculty oversight
During his comments to
SACUA on Monday, Schlissel
added that Curzan, the faculty
liaison to the Athletic Depart-
ment, said it "often tries to keep
her at arm's length."
On Tuesday evening, Schlissel
char'acterized his comments as
"an over or misstatement on my
part," though he noted that some-
times there is tension in balancing
academic and athletic priorities.
"There's a back and forth
between pushing hard on the aca-
demic needs of students, while at
the same time, making sure that
the student-athletes can satisfy
their athletic comments and pur-
sue their sport as a member of a
team at a very high level."
"I think Anne has full access
to all the student-athletes, the
coaches value her as a partner,
there may be challenging circum-
stances that arise as students are
balancing their academic commit-
ments and their athletic commit-
ments, but Anne isin the trenches
working directly with both coach-
es and students helping them suc-
ceed in both.

tinsaid. "It's a tough problem, and
it's not a problem that is ever going
to be solvable because it is sort of
the nature of the humanities. In
the humanities, there are lots of
scholarships that are given indi-
vidually. It doesn't have the same
organizational structure that we
would see in other disciplines."
Martin recommended the LSA
internship program to students
searching for new opportunities
beyond classes setting a goal of
placing 1,000 students in intern-
ships next year, a significant
increase from this year's 400 stu-
dents. Students also asked about
specific LSA requirements and
how the school can help students
beyond their time at the Universi-
ty in determining and succeeding
in their chosen field.
"We need to market what we
have that is available to students
and make it clear that we are here
to help in any way that we can,"

Martin said. "One of my big pri-
orities during the first term of my
deanship is to take all of those
programs and consolidate them
into one single entity, and then
bring it up to a scale that can fully
support the breadth of our student
body."
While some students offered
opinions in favor of the Race and
Ethnicity requirement currently
in place in LSA, Martin and other
students questioned the need for
such a requirement, or at the very
least, the need for Race and Eth-
nicity courses to be more concise
and focused on current social
justice issues that would be more
applicable today and to current
racial and social climates on cam-
pus.
One student, LSA sophomore
Karina Sanchez, who attended
the talk, said she feels disap-
pointed with the racial climate
on campus and with the way the

University is handling racial and
socioeconomic disparities.
"One of the main reasons I
transferred here was for your rep-
utation, including your reputation
as a diverse University," Sanchez
said at the forum. "As a Hispanic,
it is important for me to see peo-
ple like myself on campus. It has
been very hard for me to find my
place on campus," Sanchez said.
"This school is very segregated. I
feel like I've traveled back intime,
everything is so segregated. We
need to have a community aspect
where I can look at anyone in this
room andfeelconnectedto them."
While Martin said his posi-
tion is not involved in admis-
sions, something he and students
pinpointed major contributor
to diversity on campus, he said
working toward inclusive com-
munities within classrooms has
been and will continue to be a goal
of LSA.

Nothing to hide.?
A pattern of obstructing transparency has emerged at the 'U'
n the aftermath of former Athletic Director Dave Brandon's
resignation, questions have been raised surrounding
the University's public document retention procedure.
Michigan's Freedom of Information Act requires any public
body to provide access to a public record to any person who
submits a specific request. Additionally, the state provides a
number of Retention and Disposal Schedules for state agencies
to follow regarding appropriate maintenance and disposal of
public records. Despite the fact that these retention schedules
are required for state agencies, University administrators
have argued that the school itself is "not a formal part of state
government" and therefore exempt from the state's document
retention policy. While there are conflicting opinions about
whether or not state document retention policies apply to the
University, it's also unclear why the school has taken itself to be
an exception and is engaging in a larger pattern of behavior that
obscures public transparency.

At the docks

Avery spent the Winter Semes-
ter studying abroad in Vifa
del Mar, Chile.
On Wednesday
I skip my 10:30
a.m. class and
take a train down
to the wharf. It's
a short ride away
from my host
family's house in
the suburbs, and
I can smell the AVERY
fish in the air long DIUBALDO
before the doors
open.
Once inside, I pass along the
stands where fishmongers tear the
guts from conger eels and slop them
in buckets, hacking off the heads
without looking and handing them
to their children to throw to the
gulls. They keep their eyes up at the
crowd shopping for lunch, at me, at
the sea, their knives flashing away
unsupervised. No gloves.
Under a plaster statue of Saint
Peter, a man in rubber overalls
cuts slices from an enormous fish,
vertically, as if from a loaf of bread.
The statue ' memorializes "our
martyrs, fallen in the fulfillment of
their labors," their names carved in
the base and painted black. People
have died for almost everything -
stopwatches, television shows, car
tires. But many people have died
for fish. The want for fish, like for
bread or for gold, is such an old
and elemental thing that the ocean
yawns open to match its hunger for
human destruction.
I walk to the jetties. Of the two of
them, only one charges an entrance
fee: 200 pesos for pole-fishing. The
other is free and good for watching
sea lions. A whole pack of them thud
against the pier. In Chile they're
called lobos del mar - sea wolves,
not lions - but they look more like

living sausages.

That was the height of summer.

When The Michigan Daily submitted a
FOIA request for "all e-mails sent to and from
Athletic Director Dave Brandon between
March 13 and 14,2014," on March 28, Patricia
Sellinger, the University's FOIA coordinator,
informed the Daily that such records did
not exist.
"It's our policy that it's up to individual
users to determine their own document
retention," said University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald. So in this case, it appears that the
University as a whole has no specific e-mail
retention policy, and therefore allows its own
employees to maintain a retention policy that
makes administrative e-mails unavailable
fp the public in just two weeks at best. This
hardly seems like a policy that promotes
transparency. In fact, a document retention
process that forces the public to file a FOIA
request within a two-week window - further
shortenedby the five-day grace period granted
for a response - actually makes access to
public records extremely difficult to obtain.
Regardless of the University's legal status
and responsibility to abide by state document
retention policy, it's morally impermissible for
the University to neglect its responsibility to
diligently maintain public records.
AccordingtoWesternMichiganUniversity's
Record Retention Guide, "E-mail messages,
both those stored in the computer and those
printed out, should not be considered private.
E-mail messages may be considered public
records pursuant to Michigan and federal law
and may be subject to disclosure." WMU has
stipulated that e-mails, along with several
other types of documents, must be retained
under certain established guidelines. For
example, any correspondence designated
under its retention guidelines must be kept
for three years. Similarly, Michigan State
University and Northern Michigan University
closely follow state guidelines pertaining
to record management and retention. MSU
dictates that any record pertaining to general
correspondence involving an administrator
about the workplace must be kept for two
years or as long as the record is active.
While NMU doesn't seem to give specific
timeperiodsforrecordretentiononitswebsite,
it states that according to the Michigan Penal
Code, disposal of university records without
the approval of a university archivist or
authorization of the approved Retention and
Disposal Schedule may result in penalization
by the state courts, suggesting NMU considers
itself a state agency.
But perhaps even more troubling is that in
recent years, the University has developed
something of a bad habit of obstructing access
to public information.
In 2011, the Daily filed a series of FOIA
requests to multiple Big Ten schools and found
that the University of Michigan consistently
charged significantly higher fees for such
requests. Specifically, the Daily requested the
number of parking tickets issued by campus
police within a one-year time frame. While Big
Ten schools such as Indiana University, the
University of Iowa, the University of Nebraska

and The Ohio State University all provided
the information free of charge, the University
of Michigan estimated a fee of $1,240. The
total number of parking tickets provided was
comparable across these schools, suggesting
comparable corresponding costs at each
university - unless, of course, the University
of Michigan's documentation procedure is
highly inefficient relative to similar Big Ten
institutions.
The Daily also requested records for
employee purchasing card transactions in a
one-year span, for which the University of
Michigan charged $1,800 for data on nine
administrators. In comparison, the University.
of Iowa charged $181.50 for records on more
than 2,500 employees. The University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University
of Nebraskaand OSU provided the information
for free. Such excessive fees create a de facto
barrier between the public and its right to
access governmental documents. It is illegal
for the University to charge substantial
fees for the purpose of discouraging FOIA
requests, but a disorganized and inefficient
record-keeping process that leads to high fees
effectively creates identical repercussions. In
the end, the public is financially discouraged
from pursuing University records.'
Earlier this year, the University again acted
in a manner that effectively blocked access
to public information. In late January, after
former Michigan kicker Brendan Gibbons was
permanently separated from the school for a
violation of the Student Sexual Misconduct
Policy, the University refused to confirm
the separation and elected not to respond
to public outrage over the four-year delay of
disciplinary action against Gibbons. Among
other reasons, the University used the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act as an
excuse to justify its silence, even though the
text of FERPA does not prohibit the University
from "disclosing the final results of any
disciplinary proceeding ... against a student
who is an alleged perpetrator of any crime of
violence, or a nonforcible sex offense ... " After
declining to release information pertaining to
Gibbons, Fitzgerald said school administrators
considered "the spirit of the law" as well as
"the letter of the law."
Looking at all these different cases, it is
clear that the University is behaving in a
suspicious manner. The problem is that it
appears as though the University has become
too fond of using "the spirit of the law," often
interpreting the law in different ways that
always appear to be at odds with institutional
transparency. In some ways this makes
complete sense, and a strong sense of self-
preservation is to be expected. But in doing so,
the University is mortgaging its future in order
to inflate an artificial image now. A failure
to openly admit flaws and mistakes prevents
the University from wholeheartedly pursuing
possible solutions. The school must adopt a
long-term perspective for its own well-being,
as engaging in dubious practices that mitigate
today's problems will only allow underlying
faults to fester and reemerge in the future.

Draw back the curtains


A s an incoming college
student, one of the
questions that I was most
frequently asked
- up there with
which classes I
signed up for and
where I was living
- was whether or
not I had bought
football season
tickets, and if I
was excited for VICTORIA
the season to NOBLE
start. Some asked
rather ironically
- my all-girls
high school didn't have a football
team, and unless you counted
skiing, sailing or lacrosse, I never
really cared much for sports. But
some, maybe most, asked with
genuine excitement, eager for me
to experience what was, in their
view, one of the best parts of life as
a University of Michigan student.
Before I even arrived on campus,
I understood the privileged place
that football held at the University.
Things have certainly changed
since then. A series of high-profile
mistakes resulted in glaring media
pressure and student protest, and
ultimately, the resignation of former
Athletic Director Dave Brandon. But
that's not what this column is about.
Enough has been written already
about the trials and tribulations
of Michigan football. Univeristy
President Mark Schlissel, in an
earnest though decidedly awkward
recent talk, put it rather well. "If
we had won Nobel Prizes this year,
we wouldn't have gotten as much
attention as did our A.D.," Schlissel
said. "It's sad but it's really true."
The public scrutiny that natural-
ly follows an athletic program as big
and profitable as ours, intensified
by a lackluster season, prompted
relentless information-gathering
and commentary on a traditionally
opaque organization, revealing key
institutional flaws. This pressure is
rarely, if ever, applied to other areas
of University administration. The
public just doesn't seem as inter-
ested in playing a watchdog role on,
say, the Board of Regents or Office
of Undergraduate Admissions.
But in terms of their effect on
student experience, these groups
are just as important. Yet, just like

FlyingLotus:
A master at work

Acclaimed producer
brings 'You're Dead!'
set to Royal Oak
By ADAM DEPOLLO
Online Arts Editor
I've been mulling this article
over in my head for the better
part of three weeks. Now, not
every waking moment of those 18
days was spent curled in a fetal
position on my bed, marveling in
horror at the utter inadequacy of
written language for the task at
hand, but suffice it to say that the
problem posed by this article has
kept me up nights.
It's the type of problem any
writer faces, but that doesn't
make it any less profound.
Really, it's the problem of
written expression. - to
translate something intangible,
a feeling, a moment, an image,
into words that other people
will understand, to tell the
"truth" about the thing you're
writing about. And the truth is
that two-and-a-half weeks ago
at the Royal Oak Music Theatre,
I experienced something
uncanny, something that I'm
not sure I have the literary
wherewithal to articulate.
In short, I went to a Flying
Lotus concert.
But I've already run into
problems - really, "concert" isn't
exactly the right word to describe
what FlyLo did. Yes, I was in
what you might call a concert
hall. Yes, there was a stage with
a musician on it. Yes, a room
full of people had come there to
watch said musician make noises
at them. But within moments of
FlyLo taking the stage, it became
clear that "concert" and all of
the expectations tacked onto
9 that term - the song, clap, witty
banter, song, clap formula, the
room full of gyrating twenty-
somethings in various states
of inebriation - none of that
imagery would adequately
encapsulate the sublime artwork
happening in that theater.
FlyLo's stage setup consisted
of a massive prismatic cube
flanked on either side by strobe
lights and enormous speakers.
Inside the cube, whose walls
doubled as 3-D projector screens,
a small set of stairs led up to a
podium where the L.A.-based
producer had set up his laptop
and DJ equipment, looking a
good deal like a conductor's
stand. Before he began his

set, FlyLo appeared with little
ceremony from behind the right
side of the cube. He walked out
to the front of the stage, dressed
in an undertaker's black suit, and
addressed his audience as the
sound of funereal organs filled
the room.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're
gathered here tonight for a most
beautiful occasion."
He slowly climbed the stairs
to his perch, putting on a black
mask with glowing yellow
eyes. The organs cut out and he
finished his speech.
"But I'm afraid I have to tell
you ... You're dead!"
The frenetic opening lines
of "Theme" from FlyLo's latest
release, You're Dead!, blared
out of the speakers, and the
music would continue with
only a handful of pauses for
the e tof 4h ,rariy ly e
hour set.* He'.was'dding lairge y
improvised trap renditions of
tracks from his entire Flying
Lotus discography interspersed
with a handful of Captain
Murphy numbers, pairing his
beautifully syncopated rhythms
with stunning visuals projected
onto the walls of the cube
surrounding him.
The one minute and thirty
second track "Fkn Dead"
expanded into a nearly four-
minute-long trap/jazz fusion
accompanied by animations
of tastefully disemboweled
and segmented bodies
provided by Japanese guro
artist Shintaro Kago. "Getting
There," a masterpiece of sound
engineering off of 2012's Until
the Quiet Comes, came across
just as crisply in the live setting
as a lightly rotoscoped version of
the track's music video played on
the screen.
Throughout the performance,
FlyLo stood at his podium, his
mask's yellow eyes shining
through the animations
surrounding him, rocking back
and forth in time with the music.
He was very clearlyuninterested
in providing the sort of inclusive
experience one usually finds at
a hip-hop concert. There was
no call and response with the
audience and certainly no call to
"get turnt"; he didn't even really
ask how anybody was doing, All
in all, he might have said 100
words by the end of the night,
most of those at the very end of
the show.
But if this performance was
impersonal, it was impersonal
in the same sense that an opera

or tragedy is impersonal, which
is to say profoundly beautiful
and moving without feeling the
need to be on a first-name basis.
FlyLo wasn't there to build a
reputation or a fan base - he has
already achieved both in spades,
and his reward is the ability to
create art divorced from the
more practical considerations
that bog down other artists. The
crowd was unusually reticent for
a hip-hop concert, but the gaping
mouths and stunned expressions
around the room showed that
they understood their job: they
were simply there to watch the
master at work.
That room full of awed
expressions illustrates, perhaps
better than any other image, the
uncanniness and intangibility
of this concert. You could
not be in that room, staring
at those glwj49gyes behind
\he prdjtctor srte'ehs,and feel
anything other than a sort of
ecstatic wonder, a bewildered
reverence for the man and his
music. Flying Lotus is one of
those artists, like the AbbeyRoad
Beatles or the "Don Giovanni"
Mozart or the BitchesBrew Miles
Davis or even the MF Doom
and Madlib of Madvillainy, who
seems to have reached as nearly
as one can, however fleetingly, to
perfection.
But perfection is a very
different thing from being
flawless. FlyLo made a handful
of mistakes throughout the
show - a mismatched visual
cue here, a mistimed drop there
- but even the errors seemed
to have a sort of logic to them,
adding to the performance
rather than subtracting from
it. And that's precisely what
makes him perfect: the ability to
reconfigure flaws and mistakes
into a workable whole, shoring
up the gaps with his own
innovations. Where hip hop
falls short, he takes cues from
jazz. When simply standing
on stage with a laptop doesn't
work, he builds a 3-D projector
cube on top of it. Hell, when
Steven Ellison himself doesn't
get the point across, he becomes
a masked, nameless undertaker
with giant, luminescent yellow
eyes.
It is uncanny, it is intangible,
it's a kind of magic you can't
necessarily understand, but
music can approach perfection,
and you know it when you see
it. Two-and-a-half weeks ago
in Royal Oak, it looked a lot like
Flying Lotus.

than epidemic ofsexu-

VYlege campuses across
the nation, as
well as the Uni-

igan, there are
countless topics
of uncertainty
and controver-
sy. In afourpart
series, Jamess
Brennan seeks JAMES
to explore them BRENNAN
with interviews
and personal
research This ispart l.
In the past year, the Univer-
sity has become ground zero for
the crisis of sexual assault on col-
lege campuses. From the school's
bungling of the sexual assault
case involving former Michigan
kicker Brendan Gibbons, to recent
campus demonstrations, includ-
ing the spray-painted phrase
"EXPEL RAPISTS" across the
Diag, students and administration
alike can no longer sweep sexual
assault under the rug. At the same
time, a national movement to
prevent sexual misconduct has
gained steam, highlighted by the
White House-sponsored "It's On
Us" campaign, which Central Stu-
dent Government has enthusiasti-
cally supported.
Meetings have been con-
vened, profile pictures have been
changed and PSAs have gone viral
- but what does this all amount to
for students? What will this mean
for survivors and their allies from
all walks of life? What exactly
does "stopping sexual assault"
look like?
Over the past month, in inter-
views with dozens of peers,
student leaders and members
of administration, along with
additional research, I've tried
to make sense of these ques-
tions and dozens of others. What
follows is the first column of a
four-part series examining sex-
ual assault on college campuses.
My findings and opinions are by
no means conclusive; this is an
attempt to shed light on some
of the many moving parts that
students grapple with when it
comes to this issue, especially
the aspeFtswefind most confus,
ing, painful and pola-izing.
To any perspectives I leftout
or simply glossed over, I hope you
will write to me so I can continue
to learn. I also hope you'll consid-
er writing your own viewpoints
in The Michigan Daily so that all
students can hear your voice.
When it comes to sexual
assault and its endless list of
related problems, the only true
consensus amongst students
seems to be confusion.
While most of the students I
interviewed gave relatively simi-
lar definitions for "sexual assault"
as a term, their ability to confi-
dently draw lines around consent,
alcohol and coercion typically
came up short. This is not because
our student body is stupid, but
rather due to the all-encompass-

ing language that deals with sex-
ual misconduct.
According to the Universi-
ty's Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center, sexual
assault covers a broad range of
behaviors, from violent, penetra-
tive rape, to one-time instances
of groping without consent and
everything in between. This was
pretty consistent with the defi-
nition most students gave me.
But SAPAC doesn't stop there,
also making sure to include
any unwanted sexual contact
obtained through threat of force,
intimidation or coercion. A
handful of students even went so
far as to saythat sexually explicit
speech, gestures or text messag-
ing fell under the increasingly
large umbrella of sexual assault.
Anne Huhman, SAPAC pro-
gram manager for education
and prevention, sat down with
me to try and make sense of this
terminology.
Huhman, who has been at
SAPAC for a decade, explained
that the broad language is meant
to emphasize the core issue
behind consent: the experience
of the individual. Because every
person has a unique life and
perspective factoring into their
boundaries, the language around
sexual assault is intentionally left
open-ended. According to Huh-
manthis is ahuge partofSAPAC's
Relationship Remix workshop for
first-year students in an effort

to get students focusing on what
they as individuals want out of
relationships and sex.
LSA senior Kathryn Abercrom-
bie, a former SAPAC volunteer
coordinator, expressed a similar
viewpoint, saying that handling
sexual assault should be all about
empowering the survivor.
In large part, the ambiguities of
consent come from the intensely
personal nature of sex and sexual
assault. These individual varia-
tions are most clearly present in
what may be the blurriest of the
lines surrounding sexual assault:
the role of alcohol.
Drawing a line between con-
sent and over-intoxication was
by far the most challenging ques-
tion for most of the students I
interviewed. A handful of stu-
dents emphasized a person's
ability to communicate or appear
coherent, with one senior defin-
ing it as a person "doing things
they would not normally do." But
this poses challenges. One senior
noted her ability to appear com-
pletely sober and put together
while blacked out, even to the
point that her friends can't tell
she's been drinking. Moreover,
this strategy is hard to apply to a
person you don't know very well
or have never seen intoxicated.
"We try to validate that we
know that happens," Huhman
said regarding consensual sex
under the influence. However,
she also expressed concerns about
the confusing physiological roles
played by food, sleep and a per-
son's tolerance.
"If what we are aiming for is
good, positive, healthy, satisfy-
ing sex, it's sometimes harder to
accomplish when under the influ-
ence of alcohol or other drugs,"
Huhman wrote in a later e-mail,
also noting that "it's important to
remember that people who sexu-
ally assault others will intention-
ally use alcohol and other drugs as
tools to sexually assault.
"It would be a lot easier if we
could just draw a line," she said,
a sentiment that most students
seemed to share.
Like issues surrounding alco-
hol, there's a lot of gray area
when it comes to getting clear
consent. Of the students I interc,.
vie'wed, most explicitly asked for'
or were asked for' consent less
than half the time they had sex.
One senior told me that while
he usually asks permission,
many times he has been "too
drunk to remember" if he asked
or not. For the most part, how-
ever, men said they didn't ask
because they were familiar with

their partner or they thought
it would be awkward anti "kill
the moment."
Abercrombie, when asked
about these barriers to affirma-
tive consent, answered with a
pointed question of her own: "Are
you honoring awkwardness over
your partner's safety and sense
of security?"
This fear of an awkward
moment may also be unfounded;
most of the women I surveyed had
no reservations about a partner
who paused to ask for consent,
and many in fact preferred it. One
senior said she thinks it would
"actually be kind of awesome" if
men made it a point to stop and
ask. I should note that this line
of questioning was asked, at first,
in a very gendered, heterosexual
fashion: men were asked about
getting consent, women were
asked about giving it. However,
even as I began asking students
without gendering the question
or assuming their sexuality, men
discussed getting consent while
women discussed giving consent.
AsHuhman emphasized inthe
beginning of our conversation,
sexual assault is an intensely
personal concept. From affirma-
tive consent, to alcohol, to just
defining terms, erring on the
side of caution is the only way to
ensure a potential partner's safe-
ty. At first, I was somewhat dis-
appointed by my own inability to
make gray areas black and white;
a frustration that only increased
when dozens of interviews failed
to help me. But rather than being
vague, these concepts are meant
to be inclusive
While .the law may attempt
to draw lines around what is
and isn't assault, and different
levels of sexual violence, it can
never come close to defining the
trauma that each individual sur-
vivor feels from any variety of
forced sexual contact. In accept-
ing these terms as broad, we are
in fact accepting the reality that
caution is our only choice when
faced with a decision that could
potentially permanently ruin
another person's life.

tiful beings ... they just change,"

ring and sold

Now he has sex,

knows what it Island
really means to
be in love and, subsequently, to be
heartbroken. Though technically
still a Jonas brother, Nick Jonas
is desperate for you to realize that
he no longer fitsthe imagethatthe
Jonas Brothers used to embody.
And at certain points on Nick
Jonas, his efforts pay off.
At its best moments,Nick Jonas
is an urban-leaning pop album
with grimy, throbbing beats
and sensual lyrics sung by an
experienced.- emotionally and-
sexually - Jonas. On "Numb,"
which features a verse from
Angel Haze, a brokenhearted
Jonas reflects using a mature
voice that he didn't have before

with lines like, "Fuck with my
head, like it's nothing at all" and
"Swallow my pride, you swallow
me whole" over a pulsating, club-
ready backing. To be sure, there's
very little subtlety here - lyrics
like these help him craft songs
that are borderline erotic - but
that's not what he's striving for.
As has been abundantly clear
from his numerous interviews
and photoshoots this fall, Jonas
is conscious of the need for
Nick Jonas 2.0 to exemplify an
extreme departure from his
previous image. In order for
his fans and the general public
to disassociate him from it, he
needs to shock them. So if he has
to pose inhis Calvins (gratuitous
crotch-grab included) for a
magazine or proclaim that he
wants his fans to have sex to
his new music for people to pay
attention to him, he's more than
game. And the material on Nick
Jonas reflects that.
"Teacher," a funk-infused
dance jam that puts his
impressive falsetto on display,
sounds almost Timberlake-
esque as he entices his love
interest by singing, "It's like
your mama never taught you
how to love / So let me teach
ya." Though Timberlake
comparisons are apt - Nick
Jonas is essentially Jonas's
Justified in that it signals his

emancipation from being just
another boy band standout -
Jonas doesn'tquite stack up.Yes,
there are other bright spots in
the set: The album's declarative
second single "Jealous" has
proven to be a sleeper hit
(and deservedly so) and the
foot-stomping "Wilderness"
channels OneRepublic in all
the right ways. But Jonas's.
strong new perspective and
image too often gets dragged
down by forgettable material.
"Take Over" brings nothing new
to the table and comes across as
just another nondescript pop song.
"Avalanche," a soaring duet with
Demi Lovato, could easily have
been recorded when the pair still
starred in separate shows on the
Disney Channel.
Nick Jonas isn't what you'd
normally expect from a Nick
Jonas album and, in that way, it
proves to be a generally pleasant
surprise. Though he's not being
asgroundbreakingashe probably
thinks he is, Jonas has succeeded
in sheddingsome of the squeaky-
clean boy band shine that the
world had come to expect from
him and replaced it with a racier,
more mature varnish. Nick Jonas
may scream more Timberlake-
lite than oozing full-on sex
appeal, but it is indisputably a
step in the right direction for the
youngest of the JoBros.

media in public relations. And in
the world of classical music, the
SFS has defined the cutting-edge
of the social media savvy.
"(When we created the label)
we wanted to control all aspects
of the media," Kieser said. "So
that includes not only what we
recorded and when we recorded,
but also how that media was
producedandunderwhatformats
and how the distribution would
work. So essentially, we became a
kind of indie label."
This has meant not only an
increasingly global presence
across a variety of platforms and
formats, but also the move to
found an in-house record label.
The SFS has been successful in
centralizing everything from
production to distribution
to media relations. Beyond
constituting a successful business
model, the movement illustrates
the interdependence of economic
and artistic practice. With the
integration of recording and
distribution, the SFS grants itself
that much more artistic license
by not being accountable to an
external agent.
The SFS took an even bigger
gamble by producing a multi-
million dollar project spanning
many years called Keeping
Score, which exhibits broadcasts
of performances, video and
documentary media and
educational resources.
"It's highly unusual for an
orchestra or a performing arts
entity to actually produce their
own PBS miniseries, but that's
what we did," Kieser said.

"There is no other program that
takes a live performance and
builds around it an experiential
documentary."
The SFS popularizes classical
music at multiple levels: first,
at the basic level of bringing
classical music to more listeners
and, second, by humanizing
the people whose lives' work
underlies an area of cultural
commonly associated with the
esoteric, the inaccessible and the
unpopular.
The SFS has made itself
known worldwide through its
partnerships with international
distribution companies. Their
reputation is so well-based
through these efforts that they
were awarded the Preis der
deutschen Schallplattenkritik
(German Record Critics' Award)
for their recordings of Mahler's
symphonies, a grand gesture
for an American symphony by a
German association.
The SFS's first-night program
inAnnArborwillfeatureMahler's
Seventh Symphony, their
second a bill of Liszt, Prokofiev
and Ravel. To choose such
different programs is a bold and
demanding aesthetic decision.
This creative breadth represents
the innovative and adventurous
attitude that the SFS exhibits
in all aspects of its practice.
With acclaimed conductor
Michael Tilson Thomas at the
helm, fans of classical music
can expect a brilliant and
enchanting performance from
this Grammy-award winning
orchestra.

century and does not in any way
reflect "a natural state of things,"
as it concerns music in the public
sphere. Even the ominous,
rending calls-and-responses
between baritone and horn
cannot answer the question of
how an orchestra will get flights
booked, meals cooked and all the
money needed to keep it going.
These facts are so self-evident
that they're often just forgotten.
As John Kieser, general manager
of the San Francisco Symphony
(SFS), discussed in an interview
with The Michigan Daily, the
orchestra is something that lives
by sculpting a public presence
or, to use his phrase, a "brand."
Increasingly, this has meant

Barnes Arico coaches Team USA

By MINH DOAN
Daily Sports Writer
Each year, men and women
from across the country come
to the U.S. Air Force Academy
in Colorado Springs, Colorado
to train so that they can one
day serve their country on the
battlefield.
Michigan women's basketball
coach Kim Barnes Arico also
made the trek to Colorado
Springs this summer to
represent the United States - on
the basketball court.
Barnes Arico was an assistant
coach for the USA Basketball
U-18 National Team this
summer, helping the team win
the 2014 FIBA Americas U-18
Championship Tournament with
an undefeated record.
"The experience in Colorado
was incredible," Barnes Arico
said. "Having the opportunity to
put on a USA shirt and represent
your country was a phenomenal
experience."
The U.S. outscored its
North and South American
counterparts by a combined 530-
306 over five games, which led
to a different problem than one
Barnes Arico is used to facing.
"You don't want to embarrass
the competition, while at the
same time you want to make sure
you're going hard and getting
better," Barnes Arico said. "So it's
a fine line and balance of trying
to do that, but it also gives the
opportunity for everyone to play."
But even while rolling past
opponents, the tournament
victory didn't come without its
difficulties - especially when
it was three college coaches
training12 high schoolers.
"That was a little bit of
transition when you have 12 kids
who have never experienced a
college practice," Barnes Arico
said.

from well-rounded high school
programs, others came from
environments where they were
the superstar and never had a
competitive practice. The biggest
challenge was getting those
players up to speed with the rest
of the team.
USA Basketball stresses
an appreciation of playing for
the country, which helped the
transition.
"They want to be great. So
when they have the chance to
work with college coaches before
they go to college, they embrace
that experience," Barnes Arico
said. "USA Basketball does a
phenomenal job of really saying
how fortunate and how blessed
they are to have this opportunity
and to be respectful of it, to be
mature about the opportunity."

The experience also gave
Barnes Arico a chance to work
with Dawn Staley, whom Barnes
Arico calls "one of the best
women's basketball players ever"
and now coaches South Carolina.
Staley, who owns three
Olympic gold medals for her
play in the 1996, 2000 and 2004
Games, is known for her vocal
leadership on the sidelines,
which is similar to Barnes Arico's
coachingstyle.
Exceptinthissituation, Barnes
Arico had to take a backseat.
"I've only ever been a
head coach so it was a great
experience for me to learn from
somebody else and have the
assistant role, watch (Staley)
work and assist her in any way
I possibly could," Barnes Arico
said. "It was a good opportunity
to have a different role."

The tournament win qualified
the United States for the FIBA
U-19 World Championship,
which will be held next year in
Russia. The United States has
won that tournament the last five
times it has been held.
The FIBA Americas U-18
Championship is supposed to be
"alittle biteasier"thanthe World
Championships, though there is
no denying that the leadership
of Staley, Barnes Arico and
Louisvillecoach JeffWalzhelped
the United States to victory.
But when asked if she would
get a chance to coach in the
World Championships or for her
country in the future, Barnes
Arico said she had no idea.
She may have enjoyed her time
with the red, white and blue, but
now she turns her focus to the
maize and blue.

Field hockey wraps up campaign

By BRANDON CARNEY
Daily Sports Writer
For the second straight year
the Michigan field hockey team
finds itself on the outside of the
19-team NCAA Tournament.
Finishing 13-7 overall and going
7-2 in Big Ten play wasn't enough
to earn a spot, and the Wolverines
were one of the last teams to be
omitted from postseason play.
Three Wolverines were
selected to the All-Big Ten team:
fifth-year senior midfielder
Ainsley McCallister, fifth-year
senior back Leslie Smith and
junior back Lauren Thomas.
That star power was a driving
force behind Michigan's second-
place finish in the conference
standings. But in their Big
Ten Tournament semifinal
matchup with Northwestern, the
Wolverines suffered their fourth
overtime defeat and came a goal
short of an NCAA bid.
With its season concluded, the
Daily breaks down the best and
worst of this oast season.

MVP: Ainsley McCallister
McCallister was left off the
preseason Big Ten Players to
Watch list despite finishing
last season with All-Big Ten
first-team honors. But this
year showed why she deserves
national praise.
Finishing the season with 18
assists - second in the Big Ten
- McCallister was the creative
player Michigan needed to
run the offense. She earned a
majority of her assists in the role
of inserter off penalty corners,
finding her teammates who
capitalized off the opportunities.
Late in the season, McCallister
began to score as much as she
was helping her teammates do so.
In the final two regular season
games, against New Hampshire
and Ohio State, she scored four
of the five goals including game
winners in both contests. She had
six total goals on the year.
The fifth-year senior's
offensive production earned her
another first-team, All-Big Ten
selection. She finishes her career

fourth on Michigan's all-time
assists list and leaves a legacy of
being a positive leader on the field
throughouther career.
Best Win: 3-2 at Penn State
(OT), Sept. 19
After losing their opening two
games against North Carolina
and Wake Forest, the Wolverines
rebounded with a six-game win
streak, with the most impressive
victory coming 'at then-No. 6
Penn State.
Michigan came back from a
2-0 deficit at halftime, scoring
less than four minutes after the
break and again with 15 minutes
remaining in regulation.
McCallister completed the
comeback, scoring the game
winner in overtime to give
Michigan its fifth straight
win. The victory was also the
Wolverines' first conference win,
and the only overtime victory
they achieved this year.
Worst Loss: 2-1 vs. Michigan
State. Oct.24

The Wolverines suffered a
number of heartbreaking, last
minute defeats on the year,
but the loss that hurt the team
the most was to in-state rival
Michigan State at home.
Michigan allowed both
Spartan goals in a two-minute
span in the first half, and could
only score once in the following
half despite drawing four penalty
corners.
The Wolverines dominated all
aspects of thatgame, outshooting
and out-cornering Michigan
Stateontheday,buttheunranked
Spartans had the winning touch
that the Wolverines couldn't find.
The defeat was Michigan's
only loss to an unranked
opponent, and, with it coming
late inthe season, ultimatelyhurt
the Wolverines' chances for an
NCAA Tournament bid.
Top Freshman: Sam
Swenson
The addition of goalie Sam
Swenson to the team created
fierce competition with
sophomore goalie Chris Lueb
for the number one spot. The
freshman from England won the
starting job easily though, and
kept it after not allowing a goal
for over a 230-minute stretch
through five games in September.
Swenson played in all 20
games and started 17. She boasted
63 saves through the year, and
earned three solo shutouts.
Her best game was a seven-
save performance against
then-No. 4 Maryland. Despite
conceding two goals, Swenson
came up with save after save,
singlehandedly preventing a
massive blowout at home, and
kept the Wolverines, who would
go on to lose 2-0, in the game
late against their highest-ranked
conference foe.
The addition of Swenson
this season was a large factor in
Michigan's 13-win campaign.
She improved each game in the
cae eand became a playerthe
defenders in front of her could
constantly rely on. Looking
ahead, Swenson will be one to
watch through her remaining
three years for the Wolverines.

Interim Athletic Director Jim
Hackett could be in office for
another year or another month.
Either way, he will be paid
handsomely.
Following former Athletic
Director Dave Brandon's
resignation Oct. 30, Hackett
will work in an interim role for
an "indefinite" period of time,
for which he will be paid an
annual salary of $600,000. This
information comes after the
University released Hackett's
appointment letter Monday
evening.
The letter also stipulates
that Hackett will be eligible for
University benefits, including
health and life insurance, as well
as compensation for housing for
as long as he is in office.
Hackett's salary is less than
Brandon's $900,000 annual
pay, which also featured
potential bonuses and deferred
compensation that would have
given the former athletic director
a total annual compensation of
more than $1 million.
"The term of your
employment is indefinite at

the will of the president, and is
expected to continue until such
time as a new Athletic Director
is installed," the letter stated.
Hackett signed on Nov 3. -
two days after the appointment
became effective.
University President Mark
Schlissel told The Michigan
Daily last week he had not
yet begun the search for a
new athletic director, nor had
he determined how long the
process would take.
In a speech to the Senate
Advisory Committee on
University Affairs Monday,
Schlissel said he aims to find
an athletic director who will
inspire integrity within the
department.
"Some folks wanted me
to hire an athletic director
(earlier) so he could fire the
current football coach and
hire the next coach but I want
to take the time to make sure
we get someone who is not
only technically adept, but
can ensure that the program
has financial and academic
integrity, and also someone
who shares the value system
of realizing our mission,"
Schlissel said.

The Wolverines have had

would've seemed unachievable

"He's getting stronger, and so
he's a little more stout."
According to his teammates,
Cole no longer acts like a

Cole finished his high school

Sinelli to showcase versatility

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
Every team could usea player
like senior Andrew Sinelli.
And according to Michigan
hockey coach Red Berenson, the
Wolverines are the team that
needs him most.
Seven games into the season,
Michigan is struggling to score
goals, and it's conceding far too
many. For nearly three weeks
- a stretch in which Michigan
has lost three straight games -
Sinelli has been sidelined with a
groin and shoulder injury.
On Monday, he finally
returned to a full team
practice for the first time since
sustaining his injuries against
New Hampshire on Oct. 18.
His welcome-back present was
an opportunity to play on the
top forward line with junior
Andrew Copp and sophomore
Tyler Motte.
Sinelli expects to play this
weekend, and he'll likely be

Sinelli a luxury to have on any
team's roster.
A fine balance between a
player's offensive and defensive
work rate is something
Berenson constantly stresses to
his players. If they don't live up
to his expectations, they'll find
themselves as a healthy scratch.
"Our team needs more of
what he brings to the table,
whether it's on defense or on
forward," Berenson said. "On
forward, it's his speed, playing
with grit, his compete level and
his defensive awareness in the
defensive zone. We can use that
on all our lines."
By placing Sinelli with two of
Michigan's most accomplished
scoring threats in Motte and
Copp, it's Berenson's hope that
the line will gel into a trio that
complements each other in a
way a top line should.
"Sinelli will push the pace for
us a bit on that rightaside," Motte
said. "He's got some speed as
well as the work ethic there.

freshman year, he continued
to be thrown into different
roles. And even in the middle
of his senior season, he's back
to testing out another fresh
opportunity.
"He's played (defense), he's
played forward, he's played
center," Motte said. "He's
played everything but goalie so
far."
While it's highly unlikely
Sinelli will ever strap on the
goalie pads and a mask, if
Berenson asked him to do it,
there wouldn't be any questions
or second thoughts. There's
a reason Sinelli is so well-
respected in the locker room.
"I just want to play. I don't
really care where it is," he said.
"I'll do anything that coach tells
me and anything that the team
needs."
Sinelli does all the gritty and
demanding work of a hockey
player, and many teammates
in the Michigan locker room
agree that he plays like his

DETROIT

are addressing the same concerns.
"I don't think anyone has it solved."
A changing demographic
Not only does Greater Downtown differ
economically and racially from the rest of the
city, many argue that there's a lack of integra-
tion within Downtown. The Black, working
or middle class population and the white,
wealthy newcomers are hardly mixing. Some
even say these new firms, and the people they
bring, are the harbingers of gentrification.
Williams is one person that argues that
gentrification is occurring in Detroit. The
controversial concept is defined as the buy-
ing and renovating of houses and stores by
affluent people in a rundown urban center,
raising property values but displacing poorer
residents as they've gradually priced out of
these neighborhoods. Williams proposed a
,4ew sort of gentrification called "cultural dis-
placement." This phenomenon is reflected by
the strain occurring with the chasm between
the affluent white demographic and lower
income Black demographic.
Retailers in Greater Downtown are
increasingly catering to a white, educated and
mow wealthy demographic. Lunch spots in this
area used to be $5 or $6 for a meal, but now
customers are expected to fork over around

$10.
Even Smith, of UpTo, said his apartment
building changed. When he moved in three
years ago, it was a mix of families, elderly folk,
Blacks and whites. Now, it's entirely young
and white. And rent has increased, too.
"It's very noticeable how the demograph-
ics has shifted toward young white profes-
sionals," Smith said.
This type of interaction is creating "a
Detroit of old and a Detroit of new," Williams
said.
Williams lived in Midtown asa University
student when he participated in the Semester
in Detroit program. Ina city that's more than
80 percent Black, he often socialized with
white people.
"By being based in Midtown and Wayne
State, I felt like I was in a part of Detroit I
did not know growing up," Williams said. "I
felt like I was in the same bubble that Ann
Arbor represents that is shielded from dif-
ferent communities challenged socially and
economically."
Indeed, Smith, of UpTo, said his Detroit
was a "contained community" of young peo-
ple who work at QuickenLoans, Blue Cross
Blue Shield, law firms, nonprofits or start-
ups. Just about everyone is working on com-
munity projects.
"We go out and I know people everywhere

we go," Smith said. "It's awesome. I love the
community."
Foley wrote in his blog last year that tech
startups, microbreweries and vegan cupcake
stands are not going help the city.
"That's not gonna do anything for the old
lady who goes to church on Sundays," he said
in the interview.
However, Thomas emphasized that better-
ing Detroit schools, police and other public
goods requires cash. And that's only going to
come through property and income taxes.
"I used to have arguments with Michael
(Williams)," she said with a small laugh. "He
was trying to shape that thesis of gentrifica-
tion, and my argument would always be but
what's the alternative? Detroit was being
emptied out, completely abandoned. The
quandary is that in spite of what people might
see as cultural displacement or discomfort,
the fact is that Detroit was suffering."
The split of Detroit, into old and new, into
decades-old storefronts and shiny new start-
ups downtown, might be a necessary evil to
rebuild the city and give it the funds it needs.
But Williams is still hopeful Black and
white, rich and poor, college educated and
not, will converge. He said Detroit is the place
where itmust occur.
"We offer an opportunity that allows us to
shift our thinking and our spirit on how we

define our community," Williams said. "You
have different, mixed communities coming
together in a space. If we hone the power of
that, it is a potential to seize on the challenges
of Detroit and do it better than ever before."
Back downtown, in Dan Gilbert's M@
dison Building, University alum Reid Tatoris
works as the co-founder of Are You A Human,
a service that aims to make the process of typ-
ing out words in an image before logging into
a webpage fun.
Many of his employees live in the city. For
Tatoris, the decision to live and work down-
town was a no-brainer; he said Detroit was
the most interesting place he had ever lived
in.
"It's not comfortable yet," Tatoris said."We
don't have a Target or a Starbucks on every
corner. It's kind of like a scavenger hunt,look-
ingfor barsor coffee shops.Butwhenyou find
them, they're some of the most unique places
you'll ever see in the world."
He opened in Detroit because he wanted to
help rebuild the city. He said he has bad days
all the time while growing his startup, but the
exhaustion is ameliorated just from looking
out his window.
"We think to ourselves, 'Maybe this day
was bad for us, but for this community we're
part ofit was agood day,'"Tatoris said. "I find
that really motivating."

the writer's notebook: the 'writing process' process

BY MAX RADWIN
Iread about the writing process
a lot, or talk to people about it.
There's apparently some pro-
cess that you're supposed to devel-
op so that your writing becomes
as good as it can be, some way of
going about writing things that's
the right way. I mean, there's no
right way but there's certainly a
wrong way, or so I've been told.
One Master of Fine Arts stu-
dent told me that before writing a
story, he will, for several months,
just think about plot and themes
without ever writing a word. Some
creative writing teachers have
told me they write everyday. Oth-
ers, only a couple times a week.
On computers, or at first on yellow
pads or on their phones hastily on
the bus. But I don't have a process
yet where I write things in certain
modes systematically, not really.
I tend to write in my room for
about an hour at a time, on my
computer, at my desk or in my
bed. That sounds not-so special.
But I get sort of hyped up for it.
The door has to be closed, and my
phone, tucked away somewhere,
not talking to anyone or going on
the Internet. It's not like doing
homework or writing some paper.
It's like a Zen Buddhist thing
where I clear my mind. Or, at least,
ideally.

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

My grandmother was my
fashion icon. As a single
mother raising six chil-
dren in Queens, her hats always
matched her gloves, which
matched her shoes. Her kids were
always the best dressed on the
block and consistently sported
camelhair coats and knee socks.
Seriously, my dad and his broth-
ers look like British royalty in their
childhood photos.
My grandmother would refer
to my female cousins and me as
the "Glamour Girls," and would
always have an extra sequined
clutch or beret to hand out once
she figured out online shopping.
Sipping her gin martini - which
had the tendency to make her "toes
tingle" - after Christmas Eve
mass each year, she would divulge
her thoughts on the outfits of the
church crowd.
Because of my grandmother,
I dress up to travel. I dress up for
doctor's appointments. Heck, if it
weren't for the Michigan weather
and my lack of a "normal" sleep
schedule, I would dress up for
class, too. One of the most impor-
tant lessons she taught me was
how the effort in your appearance
can convey how much effort you
are willing to put in to other parts
of your life. She hammered that
lesson into my dad, too - his nick-
name around the bleachers at mine
and my siblings' sporting events
was "Blazer Man."
When my parents would go out
of town, my grandmother would
come stay with my siblings and

me. I can't count the number of
times she chided me for throwing
my clothes on my bedroom floor
or wearing a wrinkled school uni-
form. I've never seen anyone so
appalled as when she discovered
my mother donated our ironing
board to a local charity.
My grandmother was also a
creative problem solver. On one
of her babysitting stints, we came
home from one of my siblings'
sporting events to realize we had
locked ourselves out. Being a quick-
thinking10-year-old, I grabbed the
nearest rock and presented it to my
grandmother. Without hesitation
she took it from me and smashed
in our back window to reach in and
unlock the door. The incident has
become slightly embellished in its
repeated retelling within my fami-
ly, and has now become the, "Katie,
get me a brick," break-in of 2003.
My grandmother died the
spring of my sophomore year. My
family knew it was coming. She
had been living and firing on all
cylinders in her apartment in D.C.,
but at 96, had finally started to
slow down. By Easter of that year,
she had moved to an assisted living
facility.
My grandmother's funeral was
during final exams, and my parents
told me to stay in Michigan. I regret
that decision to this day. Though I
dressed to the nines and headed to
St. Mary's in Ann Arbor that day, I
never felt the closure a funeral cer-
emony where you're surrounded
by family seems to give.
One of my last and favorite

memories of my grandmother
is sitting in her apartment dur-
ing Fall Break earlier that year,
drinking coffee and discussing
our favorite topic: clothes. Spe-
cifically, we talked about the per-
fection of navy blue. It has the
slimmingeffectofblack withoutthe
drabness. It goes with almost
anything and adds that put-togeth-
er feel. It can be worn at just about
any time of the year.
Since then, to me, navy blue
has been my grandmother's color
and holds a dominant place in my
closet. It has come to represent her
mantra of looking polished every
time you step out the door - one
I have failed at frequently in my
senior year - and putting your
glittery-shoed foot forward.
Navy blue has been a constant
reminder of my relationship with
my grandmother, one I thought
could never be replicated. This
year, however, I have added a new,
slightly contrasting color to my
closet, which has come to repre-
sent a woman who has had a simi-
lar impact on my life.
Ann and her husband George
run their own cleaning business.
Every Monday and Wednesday
night, they come in and clean the
Student Publications Building on
420 Maynard Street, or the address
of my second home, The Michigan
Daily.
I met Ann shortly after my
grandmother died, when I was
working on the summer staff of
the Daily. The newspaper's weekly
production was on Wednesday

nights, and that summer I had
developed the bad habit of pro-
crastinating by socializing with
anyone willing to chat. Ann calmly
put up with my blabbering about
whatever had happened in my life
that week, and pretty soon, would
come in with some great life advice
for the crisis of the month.
Once the school year
started, Ann beganto ask me ifIwas
keeping up with my homework and
going to class as I gradually started
spending more hours in the Daily
office. She has threatened to call
my mom on more than one occa-
sion if my grades were in trouble of
slipping.
Ann makes sure I'm never
walking alone at night, and that
I'm being safe when I drive to
Detroit. She hugs me when I'm
upset and tells me when I'm freak-
ing out too much over little things.
When the stress is male-related,
she never hesitates to reiterate the
well-known fact among women
that men are generally stupid.
My favorite topic of discussion
with Ann, however, is fashion. Ann
is the first person to tell me if I'm
showing people up in my outfit or
look like I just rolled out of bed.
She tells me about the fabulous
blue jacket she bought over the
weekend, and shows me pictures
of her sundresses when we feel
like complaining about the arctic
weather.
Last winter, Ann showed me
pictures of her well-dressed son,
who had just passed away from
cancer, and the beautiful outfit she

wore to his funeral. Every time we
look at those pictures, she smiles.
Ann is one of the strongest women
I have ever met.
The best days are when my
hot pink sneakers match Ann's
hot pink shirt. Those days always
spark the discussion of how great
hot pink is. It's a bold statement;
it's approachable. It adds some fla-
vor to an outfit and it's visible from
far away.
When Ann came in a few
Mondays ago, she said she had
something for me. She went out to
her car and came back with a hot
pink T-shirt, just like the one that
matched my sneakers. Now I had
the complete outfit, hot pink from
head to toe.
Looking at Ann's gift some
days later, I thought about my
grandmother. I thought about how
she would tell me about going to
the different shops in New York
City to make sure her hats and her
gloves matched. I thought about
her all-white outfit - complete
with white patent leather Go-go
boots - she wore to open presents
with my cousins on Christmas
morning. I thought about her viva-
ciousness, her flair, her strength.
I didn'tgoto mygrandmother's
funeral, and I still regret it. Hoe-
ever, I no longer have the feeling
that I'm missing something, that
the closure I was meant to feel by
being with my family at the cere-
mony will never come. I've learned
to see my grandmother in other ,
people and in other colors. And for
that, I am forever grateful to Ann.

6B Wednesday November12, 2014 // The Statement
Redefining a space: Trotter hopes to expand its community
by Sam Gringlas

In a darkened basement on Washtenaw
Avenue, half a dozen students gathered
Nov. 7 to watch old episodes of "Scandal"
over Coldstone ice cream and waffle cones.
- m Attendance was slimmer than the previous
week's event. On Halloween, a few dozen peo-
ple crowded the Trotter Multicultural Center
for an afternoon showing of the film "Hocus
Pocus." That group was so large the hot soup
bar ran out early.
With new programming and advisory
boards, formed under the leadership of
recently appointed Trotter director Jackie
Simpson, the center is hosting a full lineup
of its own programming for the first time in
years.
Trotter previously served largely as a facil-
ity that student cultural groups, such as the
Michigan Gospel Choir or the Michigan Sah-
ana, used for their own practice or meeting
space. But apart from a 72-hour study break
during finals, Trotter lacked a unifying pro-
gram schedule to directly facilitate interac-
tions between communities of different racial
or ethnic identities.
Many students and Trotter staff say weekly
programming represents a broader shift in
vision for the role the center should play on
the University's campus.
Jessica Thompson, Trotter operations and
events coordinator, said the center is trying to
ado a better job engaging a wide cross-section
of the University community.
"We've got to encourage community, but
we can't just say it," she said. "We've got to be
about it and we have to teach what commu-
nity looks like."
School of Social Work student Charisma
Hoskins, a member of Trotter's programming
board, said she noticed a significant number
of new people to Trotter at last month's Hal-
loween event.
"It gives them the feel that this is an open
space for everybody and everyone's wel-
come," she said.
Founded in 1971, the Trotter Multicultural

some of Trotter's current challenges, but for
now, the center is still grappling with how to
raise awareness about its re-envisioned pro-
gramming mission.
Green said that for many people, particu-
larly white students, Trotter is perceived as a
place primarily meant for people of color. He
said that's just not true.
"Everyone is part of the multicultural-ness,
if you're white, if you're Black, if you're Native
American," he said.
Thompson said there has been a lack of
awareness of Trotter's offerings and the staff
has to do a better job reintroducing the facil-
ity to campus.
"We can'tjust sit right here and expect
folks to come," she said. "We have to go out
and get you."
Many of Trotter's leaders recognize the
potential for increased education about the
center's programs, but Green said the Univer-
sity has failed to introduce incomingstudents
to Trotter's offerings, particularly during
freshman orientation.
"I don't think the University has done
enough. If you talk about diversity and stu-
dent life, it should be the first thing that stu-
dents know."
Though Trotter may not be the most rec-
ognizable building on campus, especially in
comparison to iconic structures like Angell
Hall or Hill Auditorium, it has garnered
increased attention in recent months.
During a year when several incidents, fol-
lowed by a series of protests led by the BSU,
catapulted issues of diversity, identity, race
and inclusion to the forefront of campus con-
versation, Trotter emerged as a key piece of
the dialogue.
Since last year, the University spent
$650,000 to renovate the current facility and
an advisory team has begun meeting with
architects to plan for a new space in the next
three to five years.
And though Green said Trotter should
have a voice at the table, it can't be the only

"I'm sure that at one pointor even now, this
may have felt like a members-only space and it
is so not that," Thompson said. "This is a space
for all of our students ... But for those students
who aren't looking for that, who don't need
that, how do we also support them?"
Simpson, who led the University's Spec-
trum Center before taking the helm at Trot-
ter over the summer, said it's not unnatural
for students to crave a space designated for
people with identities similar to their own.
"If I spend all day in a primarily hetero-
sexual world, well when I go home to relax,
I don't necessarily want to spend my relaxing
time in spaces where I don't know whether

Campus location in the next five years could
exasperate this challenge. Though the Uni-
versity's Black Student Union called for a
Trotter that's closer to campus - a demand
the University has preliminarily agreed to -
the center's off-the-beaten-path location has
shaped the facility asa destination spot.
The current distance from campus means
it is less likely that passersby will stop in to
explore. That reality has resulted in a space
that's feels homey and safe for students who
frequent the facility, but also a space that is
not well known or widely used by the general
student population.
Though a more constant flow of students
into a Central Campus location might make it
difficult to maintain Trotter's atmosphere of
refuge, Simpson said the benefits of increased;

"I would say that we have a responsibility to the changing society ... and racism and
sexism do not have to define the future. I want to see a world where people feel free to
think and love and socialize as equals, and people feel safe to be themselves. I think that
definitely we've seen the society and the campus get closer to that every time we have
fought for human rights and civil rights and immigrant rights."

AS STARTUP SCENE GROWS

DETROIT FACES NEW CHALLENGES

I

BY RACHEL PREMACK, SENIOR NEWS ED

ITOR

Internet memes typically don't reflect com-
plex urban issues or hint at long-running
race and socioeconomic issues. Yet, upon
glancing at the White Detroit Entrepreneurial
Guy meme, a viewer can tell. It's a response to
often misguided public giddiness over "revital-
izing Detroit."
The image, which surfaced in April 2013,
features a background of buildings, set behind
a white man smiling into the distance. The text
on each meme varies, with satirical phrases
like, "Everything tastes better when you're
across the street from an abandoned build-
ing" or "Those that have the capacity to create
change have the right to do so, like me and Dan
Gilbert."
Detroit-based blogger Aaron Foley wrote
about the meme last year in car culture blog
Jalopnik Detroit, owned by Gawker Media. He
affirmed the meme's message, which intend-
ed to show that Detroit's problems cannot be
solvedby techstartups and microbreweries.
Moreover, revitalization efforts have been
focused in Greater Downtown - a 7.2 square
mile region that are comparatively whiter,
wealthier and better educated than other posi-
tions of the city. The Downtown area accounts
for 40 percent of the city's total employment,
despite being just over 5 percent of the city's
space, according to a 2013 data report from the
Detroit-geared Hudson-Webber Foundation.
"We haven't really seen the effect yet on

the rest of the city," Foley said in an interview
with The Michigan Daily. "It's not quite like it's
spreading outward. There's development going
on here and here and here, but there's no rolling
through."
While 98 percent of Midtown and Down-
town apartments are occupied, blight continues
to be a problem in many other parts of the city.
The majority of jobs in these neighborhoods
pay more than $40,000 annually, but 38.1 per-
cent of Detroit residents citywide live below the
national poverty line.
Incorporating the otheri132 square miles into
the Greater Downtown's economic comeback,
which has been hailed by nationwide media,
may soon come. Leslie Smith, president and
CEO of TechTown, Detroit's first and biggest
tech accelerator, named this a key priority at her
organization.
"For me, if that's not the outcome, we can't
declare a success," Smith said.
At the very least, Foley noted there hasn't
been another White Detroit Entrepreneurial
Guy meme since last year.
A new industry
Detroit Free Press business reporter and
author of Reimagining Detroit John Gallagher
said that Detroit's startup scene was integral to
the city's rebranding.
"It's part ofthe culture that gives Detroit this

reputation as on the comeback trail," Gallagher
said. "Startups are sort of a lively phenomena
and they help give Detroit this air that it has
now of a very interesting urban experiment
that's taking place."
Following decades of racial tensions, a noto-
riously high crime rate and setbacks in the auto
industry, Detroit is looking for a new economic
driver. And it might just come in the expand-
ing ,startup scene, where millions have been
invested from the public and private sector this
decade.
Detroit has lost more than 20 percent of its
population 25 years and overin the last decade,
according to U.S. Census Data. But a more
shocking statistic indicates a different narra-
tive: the population of college-educated resi-
dents under 39 year olds increased by59 percent
in the 7.1square mile area ofGreater Downtown
from2000 to 2010, according to a Forbes report
from 201L.
"There is a certain demographic that comes
to Detroit that is well-educated, affluent and
white and wants to do something," said Asso-
ciate Prof. Nick Tobier, who teaches topics like
social entrepreneurship in the University's
School of Art & Design. "i mean that in good
and bad ways."
Now, Detroit is building an ecosystem of
entrepreneurship, including venture capi-
talists - those who provide early-stage
funding to promising startups - entrepreneur-

ship-focused non-profits; lawyers; a tech-savvy
Chamber of Commerce; office hubs, the vibrant
urban areas that innovators crave and months-
long programs that provide funding and men-
torship to innovators.
Jim Martinez, Detroit Regional Chamber
director of communications, said tech entre-
preneurship in Detroit has grown in the last 10
years, particularly in the past three to five years.
He affirmed that the public and private sector
were making a "concerted effort" to develop
the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Martinez added
that Michigan universities, which provide tal-
ent, are also a key part of that growth.
Most cities began their entrepreneurial push
in the '70s or '80s. Until recently, the Motor
City's fortunes were based almost exclusively
on the auto industry. Large manufacturers and
suppliersdominated much of Detroit's econom-
ic history, and leaders were apt to keep their
money rather than invest in creating new busi-
nesses
"Detroit, for the last100 years, was a big cor-
porate market. We relied on big corporations,
big government and big labor," Gallagher said
of business culture in Detroit. "The notion that
someone would let just a little startup in was
just a joke."
Smith, the president of TechTown, said the
corporate culture created a stable and thriv-
ing period for the auto industry in the mid-20th
century. Entrepreneurial activity and innova-

tion blossomed within the auto companies as
the company enjoyed their heyday. In 1955, the
bosses of General Motors weren't losing sleep
over their own job security as they dominated
50 percent of the American vehicle market and
was the world's largest employer. At its peak
in 1979, GM employed around 600,000 Ameri-
cans.
In the decades following oil shocks, fierce
new competition, and increasingly outdated
technology and management practices led to
the Big Three losing their prestige, market
share and steady cash flow. And as that hap-
pened, their employees were laid offand needed
new jobs.
-The biggest factor was that the change was
forced on us," Gallagher said. "We had to do it."
The nascent stage of entrepreneurship is
attracting young people who are excited about
creating something new in a city with a com-
plex past.
"There's not a lot of followers," said Jacob
Smith, a University alum and director of Busi-
ness Development at tech startup UpTo. "If
you're going to be in Detroit right now, you're
not a follower because it's not popular among
the masses. Everybody is here to make their
impact."
it's easier to begin your startup in Detroit
than in more prosperous cities due to cheaper
rents for office space, and the presence of a
wealth of non-profits keen on building Detroit's

startup corridor. The concept of openinga tech
firm in Detroit is also still somewhat revolu-
tionary and press attention is easier to attract,
which concerns Foley.
University alum Michael Williams, a Detroit
native, wrote his Afroamerican and Afri-
can Studies honors thesis on gentrification in
Detroit. He said there was a "hipster aesthetic"
and drive for social justice to those who moved
to Detroit.
"It's hot to move to a place that's struggling,
that's a bit off the beaten path, that's unique or
atypical. It has its appeal with all its challenge
and struggle," Williams said. "We have an
opportunity here not just to work or have a job,
but really be invested in something greater than
yourself, a movement to improve humanity and
quality of life."
Gallagher said the culture and identity of
Detroit is changing.
"Detroit's public space is being identified a
little bit more," Gallagher said. "All else being
equal, they (entrepreneurs) would probably
take the chance on Detroit right now over other
cities. It is viewed as a place where startups and
entrepreneurs are welcome. It's fun - it's get-
ting to be a fun place."
However, building a startup in Detroit is not
as clear-cut a process as creating one in, say, San
Francisco or Austin. Here, Foley said, there are
questions ofwhat happens when a business that
serves and employs almost exclusively college-

educated people - like tech firms - in a pre-
dominantly middle and working class city.
Greater Downtown Detroit vs. everybody
Forty-two percent of Greater Downtown
residents aged 25-34 are college educated, com-
pared to 11 percent citywide, according to the
data report from the Hudson-Webber Founda-
tion and U.S. Census data.
The report also reflected that from 2000 to
2010 in Greater Downtown, the Black popula-
tion decreased 5 percent - 12 full points lower
than the rest of the city - and the white popu-
lation increased 3 percent. The proportion of
whites downtown is twice that of the the rest
of the city.
The differences in privilege cause a chasm
between old and new residents, as well as a dif-
ference in what each segment of the population
can accomplish.
"A lot of entrepreneurswere sort of self-serv-
ing andnot fully conscious of what their actions
had on the community around them," Foley
said. "When people would move into a neigh-
borhood and be completely insular to their
neighbors and what not, it would create tension.
A business would open up shop and say, 'okay,
we're gonna cater to a certain clientele without
being conscious of what other businesses were
doing' It created a problem that shouldn't have
to exist."

Organizations like TechTown are starting
to recognize the tension between the white,
wealthy Greater Downtown and the nearly 132
square miles which don't attract 40-dollars-
a-plate Brazilian restaurants. Leslie Smith of
TechTown emphasized the need especially to
ensure economic developments in Detroit's
neighborhoods as its fractured transportation
structure prevents all Detroiters from benefit-
ing from jobs created downtown.
TechTown partners with community devel-
opment nonprofits to assist initiatives in seven
neighborhoods throughout Detroit. These busi-
nesses aren't start-ups, but daycare providers,
retail storefronts and small- and medium-scale
manufacturers. One tactic TechTown employ-
ees might teach the business owners is how to
effectively track sales, inventory and financials,
easing the local business' process of obtaining
a bank loan.
More difficulty may come with reconcil-
ing longstanding racial tensions in the city,
which Smith said has impeded opportunities in
Detroit. It is a "priority focus" for her organiza- .
tion.
"One of the obvious issues is that most of the
action in downtown and midtown applies to a
primarily white population," Smith said. "How
can you have a city center that doesn't reflect
the balance of the city?"
Smith said her colleagues in Pittsburgh, Phil- Mt
adelphia and other revitalizing Rust Belt cities
