Thursday night, about 100 
Kessler 
Scholars 
gathered 
to listen to Lt. Gov. Garlin 
Gilchrist II in the Michigan 
League 
Ballroom 
for 
their 
annual banquet. The banquet 
serves as a final celebration 
of the scholars’ hard work 
throughout the year. In his 
address, Gilchrist discussed his 
path from engineer to politician 
and the resilience he learned 
along the way.
The 
Kessler 
Presidential 
Scholarship 
Program 
was 

created by Fred Wilpon and 
Judy Kessler Wilpon in 2007 
for first generation students. 
Starting in 2017, the program 
is undergoing an expansion, 
which includes the addition of a 
first-year seminar, professional 
workshops and an enrichment 
fund 
to 
provide 
aid 
with 
tutoring or other minor costs.
LSA 
freshman 
Lance 
Schwiderson said the program 
eased his transition from high 
school to college. Schwiderson 
said he did not feel much 
support from the University 
of 
Michigan 
in 
navigating 
academics, and that he would 

have been lost without the 
program’s guidance. 
“Sometimes I feel like the 
University at large’s issue is 
people tell you to do things, but 
they don’t tell you how to do it,” 
Schwiderson said. “In regards 
to all first-generation students, 
I don’t really feel a connection 
to that community; I feel more 
of a connection to the Kessler 
community.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Kendra 
Beaudoin 
echoed 
this 
sentiment, noting that in the 
wider University community 
first-generation 
students 
are 
scattered.

“I do a lot of work with first-
gens on campus and there’s a 
huge disconnect between what 
the University expects from 
first-gen students and what 
they think of it and then what 
first-gen students actually feel,” 
Beaudoin said. “I know plenty 
of first-gen students that are on 
campus and don’t know anybody 
else but me that’s first-gen.”
During Gilchrist’s address, he 
mentioned how a scholarship is 
an investment for the future.
“Yes, 
a 
scholarship 
is 
a 
check that somebody writes,” 
Gilchrist said. 

More than 80 students gathered 
in Palmer Commons on Thursday 
evening for the Michigan Refugee 
Assistance 
Program’s 
third 
annual capstone event, titled 
“Record Keeping: The Power of 
Stories in the Refugee Crisis.” 
Consisting of a photo exhibit, 
short film and panel, the event 
aimed to showcase the stories 
of refugees in the University 
of Michigan community and 

generate discussion about the 
power of individual testimony in 
the refugee crisis. 
For the first portion of the 
event, attendees were invited to 
mingle over finger food and view 
the photo exhibit, which featured 
the headshots and narratives of 
six University students and staff. 
Each blurb had a quote from the 
individual and information such 
as their title, year, major, hobbies 
and information about their 
immigration process. Among the 
individuals included was Knight 

Wallace Fellow Emilio Gutiérrez 
Soto, a Mexican journalist who 
was denied asylum this February 
after fleeing from Mexico in 2008 
following death threats for his 
reporting on corruption in the 
Mexican military. 
In an interview with The Daily, 
LSA junior Said Al-Jazaeri, one 
of the students in the exhibit, 
explained he came to United 
States 
from 
Syria 
in 
2013. 
Al-Jazaeri 
expressed 
it 
was 
initially 
difficult 
assimilating 
to a different culture and is still 

difficult being away from his 
family, who he hasn’t seen in six 
years. 
“This was a great experience 
sharing my story for the first 
time,” 
Al-Jazaeri 
said. 
“It’s 
important to share my story, as it 
will help people in the future to 
learn from my experience… about 
what refugees and immigrants 
face when they move to the United 
States… It’s not always that we 
want to leave our country, but we 
are forced to leave sometimes.”
This past weekend, four students 
from the University of Michigan 
won second place at the University 
of Chicago’s Midwest Trading 
Competition. The students were 
among 100 competitors across 40 
teams selected from universities 
across the country to participate. 
Teams developed algorithms to 
make automatic trading decisions 
for three different trading cases. 
The first case focused on uncovering 
the relationship between prices of 
assets; the second on making an 
algorithm that is able to adjust to 
various market conditions; and the 
third on managing a portfolio in a 
hypothetical stock market. Each 
case was scored according to profits 
and losses. The University’s team 
placed second in the third case and 
second overall in the competition as 
runner-up to the University of Texas 
at Austin. The team earned a total of 
$5,000 in prize money.
The 
event 
also 
provided 
networking opportunities with a 
number of corporate sponsors of 
the competition. Four platinum 
sponsors — Citadel, DRW, IMC and 
Optiver — hosted unique receptions 
to get to know competitors.

Sophomores 
in Business 
discuss early
recruitment

Students secure summer 2020 internships 
separate from school on accelerated track

Since the late months of 2017, 
news 
media 
has 
increasingly 
published more information about 
the detainment of ethnic minority 
groups in China’s “re-education” 
camps. These internment camps 
have been in operation since 2014, 
and the number and size of the 
camps have increased dramatically 
since 2017. Four speakers and a 
moderator gathered on Thursday 
evening at the Ford School of Public 
Policy to participate in a panel 
titled “The Human Rights Crisis in 
Xinjiang,” with dozens of students 
filling the audience of Annenberg 
Auditorium.
The Weiser Diplomacy Center 
hosted the single-night conference, 
which 
aimed 
to 
discuss 
the 
detainment of Uighur Muslims in 
East Turkestan. Chinese authorities 
recognize East Turkestan as the 
Xinjiang 
Uyghur 
Autonomous 
Region of China, or XUAR.
The detainment of Muslim ethnic 
minorities in China primarily targets 
Uighurs, a group that primarily 
practices Islam and has experience 
a long history of severe religious 
and cultural suppression under the 
Communist Party of China.

While 
many 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
are 
scrambling 
to 
secure 
an 
internship 
for 
the 
quickly 
approaching 
summer, 
some 
Business students have already 
been recruited for the summer 
of 2020. In an effort to land 
prestigious internships at top 
finance and banking firms, 
many 
Business 
sophomores 
have undergone an accelerated 
recruiting process for positions, 
which started winter semester.
Official 
recruitment, 
consisting of interviews for 
jobs at banking and finance 
firms and facilitated by the 
Business 
School’s 
Career 
Development Office, typically 
takes place in the fall of junior 
year. However, many banks 
have taken the initiative to 
start recruiting in the winter 
of students’ sophomore year. 
And companies have moved 
formal recruitment interviews 
off 
campus, 
bypassing 
the 
Business career center, in order 

to expedite their recruitment 
process.
Maria 
Hayes, 
industry 
manager 
and 
associate 
director 
in 
the 
Business 
Career 
Development 
Office, 
said the Business School does 
not permit banks to hold 
on-campus 
interviews 
with 
sophomores. 
“(Accelerated 
recruitment) 
is against our guidelines and 
our timing,” Hayes said. “Banks 
come to us and ask if they can 
host interviews during that 
time and we tell them no. My 
guess is that student worked 
directly with that company 
to coordinate that interview 
— they didn’t coordinate it 
through our office … There are 
interviews taking place outside 
of Ross for these students, but 
that’s something we wouldn’t 
encourage and we wouldn’t 
host here.”
The 
Daily 
reached 
out 
to 
multiple 
banks 
and 
firms for comment on why 
they 
participate 
in 
early 
recruitment, but did not receive 
any responses in time for 
publication.

Thursday, the city of 
Ann Arbor and the Ann 
Arbor 
District 
Library 
held a forum at the library 
on race and class equity 
in 
Washtenaw 
County 
as the final event of its 
annual 
sustainability 
series. Approximately 100 
students and community 
members 
attended 
the 
event.
Teresa 
Gillotti, 
Washtenaw 
County 
Office of Community and 
Economic 
Development 
director, emphasized the 
difficulty of the commute 
for much of the city’s Black 
population because of their 
housing locations.
“The African-American 
population 
is 
located 
primarily on the East side 
near Ypsilanti, but most of 
the new jobs being created 

are on the West side,” 
Gillotti said. “Say you live 
on the East side and want to 
get to some of the new jobs 
on the East side but don’t 
own a car — you would 
need to spend around an 
hour one way to get there 
by bus.”
Gillotti then discussed 
the 
shortcoming 
in 
transportation’s impact in 
the business sector.
“We’re hearing all the 
time from businesses in 
Ann Arbor that they can’t 
find 
enough 
workers,” 
Gillotti said. “We know 
that there is a divide and 
that we can’t get the talent 
where it needs to be.”
Additionally, 
Gillotti 
touched on the declining 
number 
of 
affordable 
housing units in the Ann 
Arbor area. Since 2015, 
Gillotti said 50 affordable 
housing units have been 
added in Ann Arbor, but 
zero have been added in 

Pittsfield 
through 
non-
profit housing developers. 
Through 
private 
developers, 70 affordable 
housing units have been 

added 
since 
2000, 
Gillotti said.
However, 
Gillioti 
contrasted 
these 
additions by sharing 
that 
800 
affordable 
housing 
units 
have 
been lost in the last 
18 months across the 
county.
LSA 
sophomore 
Carolyn Wu said she 
appreciated the wide 
diversity of audience 
experiences 
at 
the 
event.
“I really liked the 
event,” Wu said. “I’m 
currently working at 
the 
Ecology 
Center 
and I think that it’s 
really cool to see the 
conversation 
that 
we talk about in the 
classrooms be applied 
to a more community 
setting with a larger 
variety of ages and 
backgrounds.”
Reflecting 
on 
the 
challenges facing the 
Black community in 

regards to commuting, 
Wu 
said 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
better 
public 
transportation.
“I think (the challenges) 
really show the importance 
of 
having 
a 
public 
transportation system that 
is efficient and on time,” 
Wu said. “Additionally, it’s 
a really important that we 
also build public transport 
between 
Washtenaw 
County 
and 
Wayne 
County.”
Rackham 
student 
Amanda 
Farthing, 
who 
studies sustainability and 
the environment, said she 
enjoyed 
looking 
at 
the 
event’s 
main 
discussion 
points 
through 
an 
intersectional lens.
“I 
think 
it’s 
really 
awesome that they post 
these events that anyone 
in 
the 
community 
can 
come to and make all these 
connections 
between 
these 
really 
important 
topics that all tie into 
sustainability,” 
Farthing 
said. “I think these issues 
of race, housing, energy 
justice and transportation 
are all topics that people 
talk about separately really 
often, but having them tied 
together in this educational 
forum is really valuable.”
Farthing 
said 
maps 
at 
the 
event 
outlining 
where Black residents in 
Washtenaw 
County 
live 
and where the jobs are 
resonated with her.
“I’m new to Ann Arbor, so 
it was nice to see the maps 
that they put up for the 
income distributions and 
think about that in relation 
to people’s daily commutes 
to work,” Farthing said. 
“That was very impactful 
and a very real day-to-day 
representation of some of 
the topics that they talk 
about. That some people, 
due to where housing is 
and where jobs are located, 
are unable to access higher 
paying jobs.”

“One of my favorite parts was being able to connect with my friend David Alger, who goes 
to Michigan Tech, who I really hadn’t talked to in a while and really hearing his perspective 
and digging into what I remember from when we were both applying to college. And then 
in terms of writing it, just find something you’re passionate about, something that’s highly

think. So I was really glad I was able to have that opportunity.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

I’m not completely leaving Michigan — I have a few students, 
I have a few active grants, so those will continue in some way. 
But as a graduate of the University, I will always be affiliated, 
associated with the University. I may be departing from here, but 
the University will never leave me.”

“

City hosts final annual discussion on racial and socioeconomic equity in Washtenaw


Following 
the 
reception, 
LSA 
junior 
Ayah 
Kutmah, 
MRAP 
Vice 
President 
of 
External 
Affairs, 
delivered 
the opening remarks, using 
statistics 
to 
highlight 
the 
extent of the refugee crisis. 
According to Kutmah, the 
current refugee crisis is the 
worst in modern history, and 
the U.S. has limited the number 
of refugees to the lowest since 
the 
U.S. 
standardized 
the 
refugee-accepting 
process 
following the Refugee Act 
of 1980. In light of current 
policies 
around 
refugees 
and asylum seekers, Kutmah 
expressed the ability of stories 
to spur social change. 
“The power of stories is 
often glossed over, but it is 
undeniable 
how 
essential 
they are in creating social 
norms 
and 
attitudes 
that 
move generations and give 
the 
leaders, 
the 
activists, 
the policymakers, the social 
workers, 
the 
artists, 
the 
teachers, and the students 
(what’s) needed to galvanize 
international 
attention 
and 
work to create institutions 
and policies that will welcome 
refugees,” Kutmah said. 
The event then premiered 
“Blurred Canvas: Displacement 
at Michigan,” a film created 
by 
LSA 
sophomore 
Basil 
Alsubee and LSA sophomore 
Colin 
Lucero-Dixon 
about 
displaced 
members 
of 
the 
University 
community. 
The 
film featured interviews with 
Soto, Engineering sophomore 
Israa Ali and LSA junior Dim 
Mang and showcased tidbits 
of their daily lives, such as Ali 
teaching her friend to play the 
ukulele and Mang leading a 
student organization event. 
Alsubee said the film was 
directed 
with 
interview 
format to allow the individuals 
showcased to tell their own 
story.
“The idea was to represent 
all 
these 
narratives, 
their 
complicated 
identities, 

backgrounds, 
stories, 

because of how nuanced and 
complicated this issue is on 
a global scale,” Alsubee said. 
“There’s a lot of heroizing or 
victimizing people for a certain 
purpose. Our goal in doing this 
was to present an opportunity 
for the individuals themselves 
to speak.”
Soto spoke about journalists’ 
lack of safety in Mexico and 
expressed how he feels the 
U.S. immigration system needs 
reform, while Mang discussed 
how her understanding of 
her birth country Burma has 
become less idyllic as she 
learns more about its history. 
Ali 
talked 
about 
breaking 
barriers as an Arab female in 
aerospace 
engineering, 
and 
how this discipline has made 
her consider herself a citizen 
of the world.
After the film, the event 
transitioned to a discussion 
headed by panelists Mang, LSA 
sophomore Sumaya Tabbah, 
Hadji 
Bakara, 
assistant 
professor of English language 
and 
literature 
and 
Ruby 
Robinson, managing attorney 
at Michigan Immigrant Rights 
Center. 
Robinson 
discussed 
the 
importance of recordkeeping 
from 
a 
legal 
standpoint, 
voicing his role as an attorney 
is to tell his clients’ stories in 
hopes of the court granting 
them 
relief. 
To 
withstand 

cross-examination 
and 

maintain credibility, Robinson 
explained clients need records 
to 
present 
an 
accurate, 
consistent and corroborated 
account.
“Being able to keep some 
type of record is critical in 
many areas of law… as there is 
a very high burden of proof for 
clients seeking different types 
of relief in the United States,” 
Robinson said.
Tabbah said she has an 
interest in oral history, which 
began when she interviewed 
Flint residents on the city’s 
economic decline last summer. 
The “Blurred Canvases” film 
and photo exhibit was her 
next project, and she voiced 
the importance of showing the 
people behind statistics. 

Business sophomore Bryan 
Sauer is concentrating in finance 
and has already secured his 
internship 
for 
the 
summer 
of 2020 through off-campus 
recruitment this semester. Sauer 
said he spent months reviewing 
technical accounting questions, 
problem sets and interview 
questions, skills he has not 
been exposed to yet through his 
academic classes in the Business 
School.
“I started preparing for my 
interviews right after Christmas 
because the interview process 
does have a very large technical 
portion to it,” Sauer said. “So you 
have to learn a whole bunch of 
accounting and finance concepts 
that they’ll ask you about very in 
depth in the interview that you 
haven’t learned yet in class.”
Sauer was excited to receive 
his job offer, but he said the 
process to get it wasn’t without 
its difficulties. 
“It 
was 
definitely 
really 
overwhelming at first,” Sauer 
said. “I was kind of mad that 
(the banks) moved it up on us 
because that’s six fewer months 
to prepare for the interviews and 
get those technical questions 
down than you would normally 
have. In the end I kind of liked it 
because I already have my offer 

so I know where I’m working in 
15 months. So there are pros and 
cons but it was definitely very 
overwhelming and not fun at 
first.”
Business sophomore Anthony 
Coffie II is also in the midst of 
recruitment while balancing two 
jobs, 15 credits, participation 
in the Michigan Interactive 
Investments club and exploring 
other extracurricular hobbies.
“Tomorrow I’ll be in New York 
City for an interview,” Coffie 
said. “And I have assignments 
due tomorrow … I recognize 
that it is valuable to learn how to 
overcome these struggles … I’m 
trying to keep that in mind.”
Coffie said his investment 
club, 
Michigan 
Interactive 
Investments, 
significantly 
prepared 
him 
for 
his 
recruitment.
“It would be a much more 
difficult process for me had I 
not been accepted into a club 
called 
Michigan 
Interactive 
Investments, 
MII,” 
Coffie 
said. “That club has been very 
finance-focused, very markets-
focused. These are things that, 
if a student hasn’t been exposed 
to it prior to college or prior to 
being in a basic finance course, it 
would be hard for them to really 
understand what’s going on and 
how to apply that to real life 
situations.”
Business senior Scarlett Ong, 
president of Impact Investing 

Group, discussed how student 
organizations 
can 
alleviate 
stress by offering members a 
comfortable space to explore 
their budding career interests.
Ong said the culture fostered 
within a club can be influential 
in 
reducing 
stress 
brought 
about 
from 
the 
accelerated 
recruitment process.
“With regards to this whole 
accelerated 
(recruitment) 
process, clubs definitely help 
students navigate that area,” 
Ong said. “I think it really 
depends on the culture that the 
club is creating and how they 
are approaching the situation 
to support students rather than 
adding more anxiety to the 
whole accelerated process.”
Sauer came to accept the 
stress of recruitment as part of 
his daily life — he said the time 
commitment and demands of 
networking eventually became 
routine.
“I was taking 18 credits first 
semester so it (recruitment) 
was a full workload,” Sauer 
said. “People say doing that 
technical prep is a full-time job 
on top of it because every single 
moment of free time you have 
it’s lingering in the back of your 
mind, ‘I should be doing prep for 
recruiting right now, I shouldn’t 
be hanging out with my friends.’”
Coffie also mentioned how 
recruiting often feels as if it stops 
students from having a more 

traditional college experience. .
“I don’t get to spend that much 
time hanging out, like I feel a 
young college kid is supposed to 
be doing, because I am looking 
forward to my career,” Coffie 
said. “But the sacrifice is an 
investment that we have to make 
… Students are spending so much 
time recruiting and doing this 
recruiting prep that they are not 
studying as much, not enjoying 
life and the college experience 
as much”
Julie 
Kaplan, 
embedded 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services 
counselor 
in 
the 
Business School, said students 
who are unsure of their career 
path typically experience more 
stress throughout this process.
“The students that I talk 
to 
who 
are 
recruiting 
for 
investment banking and finance, 
or who aren’t sure what they 
want to do, I think those students 
might be even more stressed 
out,” Kaplan said. “The students 
who aren’t sure and were hoping 
to have this summer to figure it 
out, but now feel like they have 
to make a decision, or maybe 
they should recruit just in case 
they decide they want to do it — I 
think that’s been really hard.”
In a December press release, 
JPMorgan 
Chase 
announced 
they 
terminated 
the 
early 
recruitment 
process 
after 
considering it may detract from 
a 
business 
student’s 
ability 

to maintain a holistic college 
experience.
“... 
JPMorgan 
Chase 
has 
been recruiting, interviewing 
and 
extending 
early 
offers 
to sophomores for roles they 
would not fill until the following 
summer,” 
the 
press 
release 
read. 
“This 
high-pressure 
environment distracts students 
from learning and does not allow 
them enough time to focus on 
what’s most important: simply 
put, being a college student ... 
going forward, we will no longer 
be extending early offers for 
summer interns.”
Coffie does not believe the 
burden of added stress from 
early recruitment is the most 
dangerous aspect of the process. 
To him, accelerated recruitment 
potentially 
harms 
young, 
impressionable undergraduates 
eager to figure out their career 
by pushing them into business 
fields prematurely.
“A lot of people are pursuing 
things and they don’t quite 
know why they are doing it, 
but they want to have that 
label, that reputation and that 
respect,” Coffie said. “Being so 
young, people don’t realize that 
the name isn’t everything … I 
think people unfortunately are 
prematurely thrown into this 
without having spent the time to 
reflect on themselves and really 
establish themselves in college 
yet.”

“But a scholarship really is to 
prepare you and position you for a 
new set of processes.”
Gilchrist 
discussed 
his 
background, noting his experience 
attending 
the 
College 
of 
Engineering at the University, 
working for Microsoft and, after 
creating the first wave of social 
media networking for the Obama 
campaign, finding his way into 
politics.

Gilchrist also encouraged the 
scholars to remain persistent in the 
face of failure. He discussed how 
after his loss in the 2017 election 
for Detroit city clerk, he initially 
felt defeated. But he continued 
forward, 
eventually 
becoming 
lieutenant governor.
“My story is one of those that 
everything in life — the wins you 
get, the L’s you take — they all 
prepare you for the next thing in 
your path,” Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist finished his address by 
reassuring scholars that he sees a 
potential in all of them to improve 
both the state of Michigan and the 

country as a whole.
In an interview with The Daily 
after the event, LSA senior Mia 
Choe echoed Gilchrist’s message 
of 
scholarship 
opportunities 
preparing students for the future. 
She is a research assistant at Detroit 
Medical Center and plans to attend 
medical school.
“From freshman year to senior 
year, I’ve really seen the program 
evolve, 
like 
the 
mentorship 
programs and just the different 
events — it was just nice knowing 
that I had a community of people 
who came from a similar situation 
that I did,” Choe said.

Gilchrist told The Daily after the 
event that he personally relates to 
many of these scholars.
“I wouldn’t be able to afford the 
University of Michigan without 
a scholarship, and many of these 
Kessler Scholars wouldn’t be able 
to afford to go to a school like 
Michigan without a scholarship,” 
Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist 
reiterated 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s 
plans 
to 
ensure higher education is a serious 
option for more graduating high 
school seniors, also known as 
the MI Opportunity Scholarship 
Program. Gilchrist also mentioned 

possible plans to get more funding 
for the education system.
“We’re also proposing … to help 
improve and put additional money 
into the foundation lounge for 
helping to fund school districts, 
more money for school districts, 
more money for special education 
and 
at-risk 
youth 
programs,” 
Gilchrist 
said. 
“All 
these 
investments in the K-12 program 
will better prepare students across 
the state of Michigan to have a 
better educational experience, and 
hopefully they’ll all want to come to 
Michigan.”

Robert 
Xu, 
Business 
and 
Engineering freshman, said he 
learned more about trading from 
the competition.
“The 
competition 
definitely 
increased my interest in trading,” 
Xu said. “Even though I knew the 
basic premise of what it was coming 
into the competition, I didn’t really 
know what the industry was like. 
The competition was a great way 
to meet experienced professionals 
who could shed some light on 
that, and also connect with others 
interested in the field.”
Business freshman Benen Ling 
said he joined the competition 
through 
the 
Maize 
& 
Blue 
Endowment Fund, an investment 
management club. The University 
of Chicago extended an invitation to 
the club, and Benen Ling gathered 
a team of coders to apply to the 
event. Once they were accepted to 
participate in the competition, the 

team began preparing.
Benen Ling said he focused 
more on the financial aspect of the 
competition, preparing research 
for the rest of his team to implement 
with coding.
“I just read a lot of research 
papers,” Ling said. “The problem 
with quantitative trading is those 
algorithms you have to use — 
nobody publishes them because 
they’re 
proprietary, 
and 
that 
stuff is worth millions of dollars. 
Obviously not the stuff we do, but 
things along those lines are worth 
a lot of money, so you have to come 
up with it yourself, and most of 
that involves looking at research, 
looking at what’s been happening 
in the field, and synthesizing for 
yourself.”
Engineering 
sophomore 
Bhavish Gummadi said the team 
worked 
on 
their 
algorithms 
extensively in preparation for the 
competition.

The most extreme oppression 
of Uighur Muslims is now taking 
the form of their detention in 
internment camps, where members 
of ethnic minority groups are taken 
for “extremist” behavior— which, 
according to Chinese authorities, 
can include using Islamic greetings 
or choosing to eat halal. Detainees 
in these camps include other 
Muslim minorities in China, such 
as ethnic Kazakhs.
Estimates from various sources 
suggest that between 800,000 
and 2 million people are currently 
detained in China’s internment 
camps.
Ann Lin, an associate professor 
of Public Policy at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
moderated 
the 
event. Lin began the conference 
with a brief overview of China’s 
repression of the Xinjiang region, 
invoking the United States’ history 
of its internment of Japanese 

Americans 
following 
Japan’s 
attack on Pearl Harbor during 
World War II.
“I start with this piece of history 
because when we talk about the 
internment camps of Xinjiang, I 
think it is important to say that the 
Chinese government is not the only 
government that has dealt with 
fears of terrorism and political 
unrest by imprisoning its own 
citizens,” Lin said.
Nury Turkel, a former executive 
director and co-founder of the 
Uighur Human Rights Project and 
a Washington, D.C., staff attorney, 
was the first of the event’s invited 
guests to speak. Turkel is a self-
identified Uighur American, and 
spoke on the urgent reality of the 
human rights crisis in Xinjiang.
He described the extensive 
monitoring by the Chinese state 
that Uighurs experience, such 
as being subject to phone checks 
and data scans and even scans of 
groceries.
“And these are the things that 
are happening in real time, this is 

not a fiction, this is not a dystopian 
science 
fiction,” 
Turkel 
said, 
referencing a statement made by 
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Chinese authorities have stated 
the camps are means of counter-
terrorism, 
meant 
to 
address 
religious extremism in the Xinjiang 
region. However, multiple speakers 
at the conference emphasized 
that incidents of terrorism or 
separatism (of the XUAR from 
China) attributed to Uighurs have 
been almost nonexistent in the 
past few decades, since China 
accelerated its intense crackdown 
on Uighur Muslims.
Sean 
Roberts, 
one 
of 
the 
speakers at the event, is an 
associate professor of the Practice 
of 
International 
Affairs 
and 
director 
of 
the 
International 
Development Studies Program at 
George Washington University 
with a research focus on the 
XUAR.

A

s the curtain falls on 
an era of unity and 
diplomacy, I am sure 
members of the British Parliament 
are asking themselves, “To be or 
not to be?” That is, should they 
be holding British society hostage 
to 
nationalistic 
policies 
that 
could send the global economy 
into a recession? Well, that is the 
question. Just as Shakespeare 
meant this phrase to refer to 
death, it is more than appropriate 
to use this expression to refer 
to the death of international 
stability at the hands of the British 
Parliament.
With the third failure of the 
ratification of the Withdrawal 
Agreement 
paired 
with 
the 
European Union’s strong position 
against changing the terms of the 
agreement, the chances of Britain 
exiting 
the 
European 
Union 
without a deal seems probable. 
Since British Prime Minister 
Theresa May has already begged 
the 
Parliament 
to 
reconsider 
their decision on the agreement 
ratification — and even promised 
to step down from her position to 
do so — we are left to wonder what 
else can members of Parliament 
do? And oh, do we wonder. The 
actions of the British Parliament 
have caused nothing but anger and 
confusion.
When I think of all the 
things that are going to be lost 
from this deal, I am continually 
dumbfounded 
by 
the 
effects 
that the agreement ratification 
decision Parliament has made will 
have on the world economy, or on 
the integrity of European politics 
as a whole. Under a soft exit, the 
EU is predicted to lose 22 billion 
Euros ($24.7 billion) in income, 
and under a hard exit close to $40 
billion, which will predominantly 
fall on Germany, Europe’s largest 
economy and largest exporter. 
Britain is set to experience a 5 
percent contraction in their GDP, 
suffer a loss of 57 billion Euros ($64 
billion) in income and probably 
suffer a major financial crisis that 
would impact the global economy 
as well.
Though the British Parliament 
forced May to to extend the 
deadline to October, it became clear 
that the EU would not budge in 
making any significant changes to 
the more than 550 page document 
that was negotiated and approved 
by the rest of the 27 countries in 

the bloc. Why would they? Brexit 
is like an ugly breakup. Of course, 
the EU is going to be unyielding 
in the terms of the separation. 
Think about the integrity of 
Europe and the European Union 
without the inclusion of one of its 
superpowers. The UK leaving the 
EU negatively affects the entire 
image of unity between Europe 
and the EU. They have no control 
in the UK’s decision, and still must 
bear the consequences.
I, for one, am happy that 
the EU isn’t budging. There is 
nothing stronger than the EU 
flexing its power rather than 
enduring the cost that a No Deal 
Brexit will bring. How can the 
world just bend to the preferences 
of the members of Parliament 
that 
are 
already 
represented 
rather generously in the existing 
Withdrawal Agreement? Britain 
wanted to leave. Now they are, 
and if the world economy spirals, 
it is on them. The EU should not 
be bending to the interests of the 
UK so that the UK can cherry 
pick what relations of the EU 
they want to keep and which they 
don’t. The UK should be the one 
making larger concessions in this 
deal as it was their decision to 
leave. What continues to perplex 
me is how taking the deal is only 
temporary — yet Parliament still 
continues to take on the risk of 
taking the temporary Withdrawal 
Agreement that expires at the end 
of 2020. Let’s highlight that — the 
members of Parliament would be 
to blame. Prime Minister Theresa 
May has done everything she 
possibly could to arbitrate this 
deal, so if No Deal Brexit ensues, 
it will be because Parliament 
has not ratified the Withdrawal 
Agreement despite incentives to 
do so. When the economy and 
stability of the rest of the world are 
at stake, MPs should be ratifying 
the deal.
I can, however, see where 
some of the strong dissatisfaction 
behind the plan comes from. The 
Irish backstop would essentially 
keep EU control over trade in 
Northern Ireland, and would 
keep it bound to the customs 
union that the UK so desperately 
wants to leave. All of this is to 
prevent the border from forming. 
Yes, this is an issue as it would 
keep extend EU influence longer 
than intended. But consider the 
alternative. If there is no deal, then 

a hard border would will increase 
the likelihood of something akin to 
the Troubles conflict, which ended 
with the Good Friday Agreement, 
exponentially. If the UK is cutting 
off relations this quickly, of course 
this issue will continue to persist 
and 
would 
probably 
require 
heavier customs and immigration 
control in Northern Ireland. It 
would just put the UK in a worse 
position. I am not sure why the UK 
is trying to force a different option 
when more harm would likely 
occur at the Northern Irish border 
with a No Deal option. Failing the 
resolution for the third time is 
almost as if Parliament wanted to 
expedite the damages that are set 
to come from the No Deal policies.
And of course, we have 
witnessed the political death of 
Theresa May in this process. In 
an era where our trust in national 
leaders doing the right thing is at 
an all-time low, May, who has put 
her career on the line for the sake 
of her country, has sadly become 
collateral in this messy divorce. 
As May desperately tried to get 
Parliament to vote on the only 
agreement available, she sacrificed 
her entire career as an incentive 
for her country to unite over a 
decision to safely and securely 
leave the European Union. I guess 
my astonishment of May’s sacrifice 
is the fact that she was willing 
to unite her country around 
anything — even the satisfaction of 
her as their leader — as an effort to 
push the UK to do the right thing. 
Maybe the only good thing that 
came out of Parliament failing the 
deal is that we got to see just how 
dedicated May is to her country.
The hardest part of this is that 
we simply will not know what will 
happen. And though I am deeply 
disappointed and worried about 
the state of international politics 
because of the British Parliament, 
all I can do is wait. Though most 
of our attention is on President 
Donald Trump these days, be sure 
to pay attention to Brexit, which 
is proving to be one of the most 
important events in recent history 
Times like these force us to call 
back upon our famous British 
friend Shakespeare, and hope 
he was right when advised that 
“though this be madness, yet there 
is method in’t.”

America’s Islamophobic war on Ilhan Omar
U

.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, 
D-Minn., has received 
boundless 
accusations 
of disloyalty to the United States. 
The first round of fury can be 
attributed to her pro-Palestinian 
views, and callous comments on 
Israel that aligned with certain 
age-old, anti-Semitic conspiracy 
theories. While Omar should 
have 
been 
watchful 
of 
her 
language, we should note that 
she has unequivocally apologized 
and said, “anti-Semitism is real 
and I am grateful for Jewish allies 
and colleagues who are educating 
me on the painful history of anti-
Semitic tropes.”
But more recently, social 
media 
has 
shifted 
from 
antagonizing Omar for anti-
Semitism to demonizing her 
with a 20-second snippet of her 
20-minute 
speech 
about 
the 
9/11 attacks during the Council 
on American-Islamic Relations 
banquet on March 23. The 
speech took place a week after 
the New Zealand attacks, where 
Omar made the case for Muslim 
activism — while many protesters 
gathered outside and chanted, 
“Burn the Koran,” “Ilhan Omar 
go to hell,” and “Shame on you 
terrorists.” Such outcries are 
odiously Islamophobic in origin.
Islamophobic 
onslaughts 
equating 
Omar 
with 
9/11 
bombings found its inception 
before she even uttered a word 
regarding the attacks. In early 
March, on West Virginia GOP 
Day, a poster of Omar was placed 
in 
the 
statehouse 
featuring 
imagery of the 2001 massacre 
and captioned, “‘Never forget’- 
you said.. I am proof - you have 
forgotten.” On March 21, prior to 
her speech at the CAIR banquet, 
a man from New York called 
Omar’s office and told her aide 
that he would “put a bullet in her 
(expletive) skull.” He was later 
arrested for threatening to kill 
Omar.
Last 
Thursday, 
shallow 
journalism 
from 
the 
New 
York Post capitalized on this 
unsubstantiated 
outrage 
by 
smearing vivid images of this 
horrific day in American history 
on an inflammatory cover page 
— only to vilify Omar. After 
facing criticism for irresponsible 
reporting, the editorial board of 
the New York Post tried to justify 
their errors by stating, “What’s 
out of context? She claimed that 
Muslim civil liberties suffered as 
a result of the nation’s reaction 
to 9/11 — even as she completely, 
intentionally 
disregarded 
the 
grim facts of that day.”
The 
most 
perturbing 
element is the willful ignorance 
that leads educated adults to 
eschew middle school reading 
comprehension 
lessons 
and 
misinterpret what Omar meant 
in her speech. The context for 
her comments was “a speech 
about 
the 
prejudice 
against 
Muslims.” Extracting a phrase 
out of this context to infer that 
it’s intentionally ignoring “grim 
facts” requires interpreting in 
a far-fetched manner that is 
optimized to derive offense and 
stir conflict. To straighten this 
out, Omar said: “Here’s the truth 
… Far too long we have lived with 
the discomfort of being a second-
class 
citizen. 
And 
frankly, 
I’m tired of it … CAIR was 
founded after 9/11 because they 
recognized that some people did 
something and that all of us were 
starting to lose access to our civil 
liberties.”
It was later revealed that she 

misspoke about one part: CAIR 
was founded in 1994. She meant to 
say it doubled in size after the 9/11 
attacks to protect the civil rights 
of Muslims who were blamed 
for the violence committed by a 
small fraction of co-religionists. 
What 
is 
so 
ideologically 
objectionable about this clumsy 
but extemporaneous speech? She 
does not assert anywhere that 
9/11 was not a terrorist attack, nor 
that the perpetrators were not 
vile terrorists. Fixating oneself on 
“some people,” and “something” 
to 
purposely 
diabolize 
a 
woman conveys a reprehensible 
message of baseless rejection 
for Muslim leaders who expose 
Islamophobia. Yet, such blowback 
is unsurprising in a political 
climate where civil conversations 
are impossible on account of the 
large number of these “outrage 
exhibitionists.”

On 
Friday, 
President 
Donald Trump amplified the 
widespread 
Islamophobic 
indignation when he tweeted, 
“WE WILL NEVER FORGET!” 
alongside an incendiary video 
that repetitively pans Omar’s 
remarks 
with 
terrorizing 
background music and graphic 
flashbacks of the carnage of 9/11. 
This disrespectful video exploits 
the trauma of dozens of New 
Yorkers for a cheap callout to 
score points against a member 
of Congress. It is these regular 
embraces of divisiveness that 
emboldens 
the 
anti-Muslim 
rhetoric and ensures it stays 
intact against the safety of all 
Americans.
But if we are going to 
censure statements, then we 
should also be appalled by 
Trump’s comments during the 
9/11 attacks. When asked about 
the damages to his building, 
Trump responded, “It was an 
amazing phone call, 40 Wall 
Street actually was the second-
tallest building in downtown 
Manhattan, and it was actually 
before the World Trade Center 
the tallest, and then when 
they built the World Trade 
Center it became known as 
the 
second-tallest, 
and 
now 
it’s the tallest.” Whether this 
constitutes bragging is subject 
to interpretation, as Trump 
supporters 
on 
Twitter 
have 
argued. At the same time, they 
hypocritically saluted Trump’s 
hate 
incitement, 
one 
that 
prohibited the slightest context 
for Omar’s remarks.
To counter backlash, Omar 
quoted the Washington Post’s 
fact checker that concluded 
her remarks were reminiscent 
of 
President 
George 
Bush’s 
“bullhorn speech.” In one of 
the 
top 
replies, 
right-wing 
businessman Dennis Michael 
Lynch wrote, “I must set you 
straight dear because you are way 
out of line. America was always 
founded upon Judeo-Christian 
principles, not the Koran. Unlike 
Muslims who are taught to kill 
infidels, AMERICANS...” This 
irrelevant, 
ghastly 
response 

ignores that Omar’s tweet does 
not suggest America was founded 
on the Quran. Omar simply 
implies that she is receiving 
strident scrutiny for being a 
Muslim. 
Furthermore, 
the 
bullies claiming that Muslims 
are “taught to kill infidels” 
vehemently 
demonstrate 
the 
Islamophobia she is referring to.
The U.S. is supposed to be 

a nation founded on religious 
liberty as enshrined in the 
freedom of religion clause in 
the First Amendment. Yet, even 
in 2019, people are alienating 
Muslims by unconstitutionally 
and 
authoritatively 
asserting 
superiority of Judeo-Christian 
principles. What’s next — falsely 
insisting 
unknown 
“Muslim 
enemies” 
were 
involved 
in 
the devastating Notre Dame 
cathedral fire in Paris, just to 
belittle 
Muslim 
leaders 
and 
intensify Islamophobia? This is 
ridiculous.
Anti-Muslim 
echoes 
in 
social media signify that Omar’s 
unpolished words wouldn’t have 
been so horrendously decried if 
she wasn’t an outspoken Muslim. 
This detestable fact reflects a 
brazen double standard and 
it is our civic responsibility to 
condemn such racist narratives 
that alienate individuals and 
weaponize faith. Yet, I find it 
futile to carol, “We should all 
fight against Islamophobia and 
hate,” as no one is remotely 
willing to listen.
The truth is people only hear 
what they want to hear. Thus, 
I will not reference the book, 
“Behind the Backlash: Muslim 
Americans After 9/11” by Lori 
Peek so people can learn how 
discrimination against innocent 
Muslims 
skyrocketed 
after 
9/11 attacks. I will not explain 
how exposing this fact does 
not translate to denigrating the 
tragic incident. I will not remind 
people that Muslims, ranging 
all ages, died in 9/11 attacks. 
I will not list Muslim victims 
of 
countless 
other 
attacks, 
including one where Muslim kids 
from my neighborhood lost their 
young lives to Islamic terrorism. 
And I will not mention that it’s 
more impertinent to circulate 
images of 9/11 than saying “some 
people did something,” because 
everyone should already know all 
of this or at least have the human 
decency to show willingness to 
grasp it.
But how do we get to the 
bottom of this anti-Ilhan Omar 
narrative? One answer is Omar 
outrightly stating that she does 
not repudiate the viciousness of 
9/11 attacks (even if it’s implicit 
in her comments), and that 
she 
co-sponsors 
9/11 
victim 
compensation fund. Yet, U.S. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., 
has 
already 
pointed 
this out, but many people love 
defaming her as well. A peaceful 
conclusion is only possible if 
people are willing to listen 
to any plausible explanation 
without sprouting empty threats 
and thrusting dialogues into a 
cauldron of partisan politics. 
Reaching a substantive solution 
requires 
every 
individual, 
regardless 
of 
political 
or 
religious ideology, to recognize 
that America is a diverse nation, 
where brewing such pointless 
resentment 
will 
shatter 
the 
tolerance and unity that exists 
today.

S

uccess has not only been 
ingrained in me because 
I am a competitive and 
driven person, but it is also my 
duty because I am the daughter 
of an immigrant. Going away to 
top a university and being the 
first in my family to do so, was a 
pretty big deal at the time. From 
the old days where I skipped nap 
time to do extra math problems 
to having over 30 of my family 
members show up to my high 
school graduation, I knew there 
were high expectations for me. 
My parents made great sacrifices 
not only to be in this country, but 
also for me to be able to receive 
the best education I possibly can.
The culture shock I faced as a 
first-generation minority woman 
within my first semester of college 
was also met with the shock that 
I was no longer on top, and that 
everyone around me also came 
from places where they were the 
best of the best. I spent a lot of 
time coping with this and trying 
to accept it. Much of my freshman 
year was spent in my dorm room 
— crying or sleeping — because I 
couldn’t come to terms with the 
idea that I might not be meeting 
these expectations of breaking 
barriers.
Every time I didn’t do as well 
as I wanted to in school, or any 
time I wasn’t the “best,” I thought 
of my dad, who lived out his 
American Dream and wanted to 
continue the progression of said 
dream through me. I thought of 
my mother, who could not have 
the same opportunity of going to 
college like me and who I knew 
wanted 
to 
live 
vicariously 
through me. Through my college 
career, I wanted to achieve the 
impossible. Coming onto this 
campus my freshman year, I knew 
I needed to take advantage of 
every resource and opportunity 
that I could find on this campus.
It is possible to be the best — to 
be the best versions of ourselves 

possible. It is time to break the 
generational curse surrounding 
mental health and stop the cycles 
of self-hatred and guilt of putting 
happiness first.
I felt like I had no room for 
mistakes, no time for falling 
behind. I felt like this was my 
one opportunity and I couldn’t do 
anything to possibly mess it up. I 
beat myself over every little thing 
that went wrong. I blamed myself 
for not trying hard enough. I told 
myself I wasn’t good enough. I 
convinced myself that I was a 
failure. Most importantly, I drove 
myself crazy over all the pressure.
The best and nothing less is 
what immigrant parents expect 
for their children. The pressure 
to be the “best,” however, is not 
always easy to cope with. While 
setting 
high 
expectations 
is 
important in achieving success, it 
isn’t always possible to meet such 
expectations. Compared to our 
peers, students with immigrant 
parents face a perpetual state of 
guilt. Despite our hard work and 
dedication, we sometimes feel 
we are not enough and that we 
should feel guilty for not being 
good enough.
When this guilt manifests 
into more than just feeling bad 
after getting a bad grade and 
reaches the point of affecting 
our mental health, students with 
immigrant parents feel even 
more like failures and even more 
confused. To many of us, we feel 
too privileged to be able to go to 
our parents about these kinds of 
mental health problems. In their 
eyes, there is never anything to 
be unhappy about. If we have so 
much — from food to money to 
clothes — then to many immigrant 
parents, there is simply no reason 
to be sad. It’s easy to enter a 
cycle of normalization of poor 
mental 
health 
within 
these 
communities. In an essay written 
by 
first-generation 
American 
Betsy Aimee, she emphasizes that 

the reality is that, “immigrants 
learn to live with sadness.” This 
suppression of anxiety often 
manifests in us, to the point 
where we too, also feel like we 
have to live in a normalized 
sadness.
Just as I came to the University 
of Michigan under pressure, 
countless 
other 
children 
of 
immigrants come to college not 
only with the stress of being a 
new, confusing place, but also 
with the pressure of being the 
best in this foreign environment. 
Added onto that pressure is the 
disadvantages that many of us 
face being first-generation college 
students and/or people of color. It 
is so easy for us to fall into this 
trap of “imposter syndrome” — 
the idea that we are imposters 
on this campus because we do 
not belong here and that we are 
not supposed to belong here. 
Research has shown that first-
generation and underrepresented 
minority students face obstacles 
that hinder their academic and 
professional success. I constantly 
felt and continue to feel like I’m 
faking it and that it’ll only be 
a matter of time before others 
realize it. We don’t have the 
generational privileges of many 
of our peers. We don’t have the 
same access to opportunities as 
many of our peers. We simply face 
the reality of others not wanting 
to see us winning.
If there’s one thing I know, it is 
that I want to make my immigrant 
parents proud. No amount of 
“thank yous” could ever possibly 
express my gratitude for them. 
They’ve instilled the best work 
ethic in me and much more just 
to give me the best life possible. 
Despite the pressure, I hope to 
proudly continue their legacy and 
their American Dream.

In the run-up to “Avengers: Endgame,” I’m running down every movie and 
TV show the MCU has ever put out and ranking them based on how well they 
tell their stories with the means available to them. This is part three of a four 
part series.
22. “Marvel’s Luke Cage”: Season one (2016)
As with many Marvel projects on both TV and on film, what makes the 
first season of “Luke Cage” work more than anything else is the casting. 
Mike Colter is electric in the title role, so unbelievably charismatic in every 
scene that you couldn’t take your eyes off him if you wanted to. He’s more 
than matched by his villains, played just as magnificently by Mahershala Ali 
and Alfre Woodard. Seriously uneven narrative aside, the worst part of the 
season might just be that no amount of time with these characters would be 
enough.
21. “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”: Season three (2015-2016)
“Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” truly comes into its own in its third season, 
with Brett Dalton completing his transformation from a “big, brave brick of 
meat” into one of the most deliciously evil villains the MCU has yet offered. 
Meanwhile, Ian De Caestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge prove themselves 
to be the show’s hidden weapons — not just charming, but capable of 
wringing more emotion out of a single glance than some onscreen couples 
can with entire scenes.
20. “Thor: Ragnarok” (2017)
“Ragnarok”’s greatest weakness is that it’s a sequel to “The Dark World,” 
and thus must spend its entire first act cleaning up that film’s mess before 
Taika Waititi can get around to telling his own story. There’s a notable shift 
the moment the story gets to Sakaar, and from there, Waititi is free to realize 
his heavy metal-inspired dreams for all to see. I may not love this as much 
as others, but there’s no denying how 
special it is to watch the God of Thunder 
finally get his due in his third solo film.
19. “Captain America: The First 
Avenger” (2011)
“The First Avenger” is a delight: an 
old-fashioned, pulpy, cheesy delight. 
From the moment he first steps foot 
on screen, Steve Rogers is everything a 
superhero should be — brave, noble and 
selfless — and that’s before he’s turned 
into a beefcake. The film functions in 

much the same way; it’s a big-hearted ode to classic superhero movies, one 
that reminds everyone watching that they don’t need a star-spangled shield 
to be a hero.
18. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” (2017)
Whatever the flaws of the landmark Sony/Marvel effort, director 
Jon Watts absolutely nails the most important parts of “Spider-Man: 
Homecoming” — namely, Spider-Man here feels more human than any 
interpretation of the character since “Spider-Man 2.” Much of this is due 
to the casting of Tom Holland in the title role but just as superb is Michael 
Keaton as the Vulture, grounding the yet another larger-than-life story of the 
film in some semblance of humanist reality.
17. “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015)
People dislike “Iron Man 2.” People are ambivalent about “The Incredible 
Hulk.” But people hate “Age of Ultron,” and I just don’t get it. It would have 
been so easy for Joss Whedon to let his characters stagnate in their second 
team-up flick, but instead, he gives them arcs that admirably walk the line of 
self-containment and feeding into conflicts to come. The action will always 
be a big draw for these movies, but “Age of Ultron” also understands that 
just as important are the moments where the movie slows down to give the 
Avengers time to grow.
16. “Captain Marvel” (2019)
As if proving my point about “Age of Ultron,” the MCU’s most recent big 
screen outing is at its worst during its action scenes, which all-too-often come 
down to people just shooting beams at each other. Thankfully, much more 
plentiful are the scenes focused on the characters and their relationships. 
Captain Marvel is an immediately relatable potential leader for the next 
generation of Marvel movies, the supporting cast is one of Marvel’s best and 
Brie Larson’s performance is nothing short of incandescent.
15. “Iron Man 3” (2013)
Like “Ultron,” “Iron Man 3” achieved near “Last Jedi”-levels of vitriol 
from some corners of the fanbase, and like “Ultron,” I think it’s a gem. The 

title is almost misleading, as “Iron Man 3” is much more interested in Tony 
Stark outside of the suit than it is in him as Iron Man. Most of the movie is 
therefore spent with Tony running around without his armor, struggling to 
cope with his PTSD in the wake of “The Avengers.” It’s a startlingly real story 
to foist upon one of the MCU’s bigger personalities, but under the direction 
of Shane Black, there’s an intelligent sheen to the whole thing that makes it 
irresistible.
14. “Marvel’s Luke Cage”: Season two (2018)
The biggest problem with the first season of “Luke Cage” was that, 
after all the grounded examination of privilege and the politics of Harlem, 
the main antagonist was another guy in a supersuit. The second season 
rectifies this, electing Alfre Woodard’s Mariah Dillard for the role of the lead 
villain and setting the stage for a gripping season where the line between 
what’s right and wrong becomes more blurred than anyone would like. Her 
showstopping monologue in the ninth episode should have netted her an 
Emmy.
13. “Marvel’s The Punisher”: Season one (2017)
“The Punisher” would always face a tricky release, as releasing a series 
centered on a gun-toting mass murderer at a time of great turmoil of 
America’s relationship with gun violence is just a bad idea. There’s no glory 
to the story of Frank Castle, though. There’s not a moment the show asks us 
to actively root for him to shoot a place up in his quest for revenge. Instead, 
“The Punisher” takes a look at PTSD and the soldiers afflicted with it and in 
doing so becomes a mature, surprisingly affecting look at soldiers’ issues in 
modern day America.
12. “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”: Season four (2016-2017)
The fourth season of “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” opens with Ghost Rider 
himself rolling up to a gang of white nationalists in a flaming Dodge Charger 
and crushing a man’s skull with his bare hands, and it somehow only gets 
better from there. By all accounts, the run of twenty-two excellent episodes 
that followed – split into three intensely character-focused arcs that kept 
the pacing lightning quick in seeming 
defiance of TV norms – should have 
changed the way broadcast television 
operated, and the fact that it didn’t is part 
of the reason why traditional TV is going 
the way of Edward Norton’s MCU career.
Next week, with “Endgame” upon us, 
the MCU’s film arm blasts them out of 
the park like nobody’s business while the 
cream of the TV crop make their case for 
why they should have a shot at the top of 
the list.

A Marvel Cinematic Universe ranking, part three

FILM NOTEBOOK

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM
Daily Arts Writer

When “Killing Eve” premiered a year ago, it felt like 
both a peculiarity and a given. Obviously a show like 
this — an intense, stylish drama dealing in espionage 
and assassins and grisly crimes — could spring from 
the 
brilliant 
mind of Phoebe 
Waller-Bridge, 
whose “Fleabag” 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
inventive, 
challenging shows 
of the 21st century. 
Strange as it 
was, 
something 
about it worked. 
The 
show 
has 
found itself an adoring cabal of fans, a perfect coalition 
of Sandra Oh (“Grey’s Anatomy”) believers ready for 
her career resurgence, Jodie Comer (“Doctor Foster”) 
devotees awaiting her time in the spotlight and, of 
course, lovers of exquisite womenswear. So with the 
premiere of Season 2 of “Killing Eve,” which now airs 
both on AMC and BBC America, everyone will be very 
pleased to know that Oh is back, Comer is back and the 
womenswear is back (it’s still quite exquisite).
In the first season, we met Eve (Oh), an MI5 agent 
re-assigned to a secret passion project to hunt down 
a mysterious assassin. That assassin would be the 
glamorous Villanelle (Comer), who is, frankly, quite 
flattered that someone has decided to pay so much 
attention to her. But whatever thrill she derives 
from being the subject of this investigation doesn’t 
distract from what Villanelle does best: killing people 
in rather gruesome, alarming ways. When we last 
left Eve and Villanelle, they had caught each other 
at last in Villanelle’s Parisian apartment and both 
confessed to their deep infatuation with the other. An 

uneasy armistice of sorts is achieved — until Eve stabs 
Villanelle in the stomach and the elusive assassin flees 
again. What a quirky, gory way to end a quirky, gory 
season.
The second season begins not more than a minute 
afterward. Villanelle, nursing an ugly wound, tosses 
herself in front of a cab to get to the hospital. A dazed Eve 
makes her way back to London (along the way she has 
to ditch the bloody 
knife before she 
goes 
through 
airport security) 
where 
different 
problems 
await 
her: Her marriage 
to 
the 
sweet, 
disgruntled 
Niko 
(Owen 
McDonnell, 
“Single-Handed”) 
is on the verge of collapse and she is newly unemployed.
Oh gets to do her best work when Eve is spiraling, 
and there’s a remarkable, gripping scene in the season 
premiere in which a rattled Eve is doing nothing 
more than sit in a bathtub, picking at her still bloody 
fingernails. She doesn’t get much time to wallow 
though. Soon enough, her boss Carolyn (Fiona Shaw, 
“Harry Potter”) has rehired her (this is TV, everyone 
is promptly rehired after being fired) and they’re back 
to investigating the brewing mystery of Villanelle’s 
employer. The stab wound hasn’t kept Villanelle down 
either; she’s quickly back to scheming and manipulating 
(and a little bit of killing too).
The scheming and manipulating, of course, is at the 
heart of “Killing Eve.” At surface-level, the show is a 
kind of mindless, stylish caper. But really, it’s so much 
more: a meditation on the female psyche, a study in 
power and vulnerability, an open question about what a 
woman can or should do to get ahead. And hey, if we get 
some coats and blouses along the way, what’s the harm 
in that?

TV REVIEW
Rejoice, for ‘Killing Eve’ 
has finally returned to us

The sun was setting on a 
gorgeous spring day in Ann 
Arbor. Students milled around 
outside Hill Auditorium, where 
A$AP Ferg would be performing 
shortly. I was occupied in the 
Panera bathroom, mixing a 
noxious concoction of tropical 
vodka, peppermint schnapps, 
Mountain Dew and Sprite in a 
plastic bottle. After my brew 
was prepared, my friends and 
I sat on a concrete ledge on 
the side of Hill Auditorium, 
passing the bottle back and 
forth among us. A$AP Ferg 
was due to take the stage any 
minute.
We entered into a dismal 
scene. The crowd was spread 
out throughout the auditorium, 
the 
energy 
lackluster. 
The 
liquor 
was 
an 
insufficient 
bulwark against the lameness 
of the situation. Soon, A$AP 
Ferg 
came 
on 
stage 
and, 
sensing 
the 
vibe, 
almost 
immediately called everyone to 
rush the front against the futile 
objections of the staff. Good 
move — but not quite enough.
It felt like the concert never 
really got going. One reason is 
that most people there were 
clearly not huge A$AP Ferg 
fans. This is normal — most 
concertgoers don’t know every 

song that is performed, and it’s 
common for non-fans to attend 
a concert. However, Ferg’s 
discography 
is 
particularly 
lopsided towards a few massive 
hits, so most people in the 
crowd only knew him from 
“Plain Jane,” “Work (Remix),” 
“Shabba” and “New Level.”
The real, unsolvable problem 
was the choice of venue — 
Hill 
Auditorium 
is 
packed 
with 
traditional 
auditorium 
seating, meaning the energy 
of A$AP Ferg’s music can’t 
really charge up the crowd 
since, if you move more than 
a foot in any direction, you’ll 
trip over a row of chairs. It is 
an auditorium designed for 
ensemble performances and 
lectures, not for hip hop or 
any other type of concert that 
invokes an active audience. I 
think this arrangement also led 
to a lot of pent-up aggressive 
energy in certain members of 
the crowd, most noticeably 
the guy in front of me wearing 
a Knicks jersey (with what I 
believe was his own last name 
printed on the back) who kept 
trying to fight people. Outdoor 
concerts in the spring are fun; 
maybe MUSIC Matters, having 
done outdoors concerts for the 
day portion, should consider 
that for future events.
While I think by and large 
he did his best, I do have one 
complaint with Ferg’s set. In 

the middle of it, Ferg played 
“First Day Out” by Tee Grizzley 
and “I Don’t Fuck With You” by 
Big Sean. While I understand 
the Detroit homage, it seems 
a little strange to play other 
people’s songs that you aren’t 
involved with at all during your 
set. If all people wanted to hear 
was a set of Tee Grizzley songs 
played over the aux, I would 
have done it for much cheaper.
I respect and appreciate that 
he continued to pretend we 
were a good crowd throughout, 
as many artists would have 
made 
their 
disappointment 
known. It’s a testament to his 
showmanship that he was able 
to keep up a fairly convincing 
facade the whole time, his stage 
presence likeable and serious. 
At the end, when he thanked us 
for being a great crowd, I saw 
some people laugh and shake 
their heads.
When the lights were turned 
on at the end, a quick glance 
around left me questioning 
the heavy use of the n-word 
throughout the concert by the 
audience during the refrain of 
“Plain Jane” given the obvious 
demographic tilt. After the 
show I walked to Fleetwood 
Diner and got a patty melt and 
fries. It was good. It left me 
hoping A$AP Ferg’s impression 
of Ann Arbor wasn’t limited 
to the narrow scope of Hill 
Auditorium.

A$AP Ferg tried his very 
best at SpringFest 2019

Anderson .Paak’s soul side 
is back. It never actually left, 
but it did go on an extended 
vacation. After the release of 
his acclaimed album Malibu 
and a collaborative album 
with Knxwledge in 2016, 
.Paak took some time away 
from recording and went on 
tour as the opening act for 
Bruno Mars. Last fall, he 
dropped his highly-
anticipated 
album 
Oxnard, which, in 
an interview with 
Consequence 
of 
Sound, he claimed 
he 
“dreamed 
of 
making 
in 
high 
school, when I was 
listening 
to 
(Jay-
Z’s) The Blueprint, 
The 
Game’s 
The 
Documentary 
and 
(Kanye West’s) The 
College 
Dropout.” 
With 
the 
star-
studded Oxnard, the 
crooning, 
smiling 
.Paak 
was 
gone, 
replaced by a slick-
talking, 
rapping 
.Paak, and the album 
suffered greatly for 
it. .Paak’s voice and delivery 
are his bread and butter, and 
by reshaping his sound to rap, 
his best attributes were lost.
With the release of Ventura, 
however, the Anderson .Paak 
we all know and love has 
returned 
with 
a 
slightly 
altered version of signature 
sound. Where Oxnard was 
braggadocious 
and 
highly 
manufactured, 
Ventura 
is 
nurturing and organic. Every 
song on the album is there 
because it is the song that 
fits most naturally and not 
because it’s the one that will 
get the most streams. Ventura 
stands in such stark contrast 
to Oxnard that it’s almost 
surprising 
the 
same 
man 
created both of them.
Ventura starts off with 
a 
strong 
one-two 
punch 
consisting of “Come Home” 
featuring 
the 
elusive 

André 
3000 
and 
“Make 
It Better” featuring none 
other than the great Smokey 
Robinson. 
If 
that 
doesn’t 
capture 
your 
attention, 
nothing 
will. 
Both 
songs 
are absolutely sensational. 
“Come 
Home” 
is 
.Paak’s 
take on soul à la Motown. 
It’s warm, it’s inviting and 
it sounds beautiful — not 
to 
mention 
André 
3000’s 
hard-hitting, loved-up verse. 
“Make It Better” keeps the 
ball 
rolling, 
highlighted 

by boom-bap drums, funk 
inflected guitar and bass and 
a sparkling string section. 
This combination lays the 
groundwork 
for 
.Paak 
to 
work his magic as he sweetly 
pleads with his partner to 
work out their issues. Smokey 
Robinson, 
though 
used 
sparsely, makes his status as 
a legend clear as he assists 
.Paak on the final chorus. 
Unlike on Oxnard, Anderson 
.Paak utilizes his features 
sparingly on Ventura, and it 
pays off. The features don’t 
take over each song. Rather, 
they act complimentary to 
.Paak, and the results are 
wonderful.
As 
the 
album 
moves 
forward, more and more funk 
sounds are introduced. Lead 
single “King James” features 
an expressive bass line that 
harkens back to Earth, Wind 

& Fire’s Verdine White. The 
song itself is an ode to Lebron 
James and his willingness to 
spark change despite his high 
profile. The song “Jet Black” 
is exactly what new age funk 
is supposed to sound like; 
it stays true to the spirit of 
funk while using modern 
production techniques. It’s 
familiar, but at the same time, 
it’s still fresh. This can be 
said for the entire album. It’s 
comforting and warm, but it’s 
unlike anything else out at 
this time. Ventura 
bridges the past with 
the future in a way 
that everyone can 
enjoy.
“What 
Can 
We 
Do?” provides the 
album with a smooth, 
easy-going 
closer. 
Anderson 
.Paak 
brings his A-game as 
he goes line for line 
with 
a 
previously 
unreleased 
verse 
from 
the 
late 
Nate 
Dogg. 
The 
two men float all 
over 
the 
track’s 
prominent 
twangy 
guitar 
sample. 
.Paak 
perfectly 
incorporated 
Nate 
Dogg’s verse. It feels 
like the two were in the studio 
together when this song was 
recorded. In a way, it feels 
like a passing of the torch. 
Anderson .Paak occupies a 
lane similar to the one Nate 
Dogg did before his untimely 
death: Both men are singers 
that carry themselves like 
rappers, so it acts as a perfect 
close to an album that leans 
so heavily on its influences.
Ventura does exactly what 
it is supposed to do. It shows 
that Anderson .Paak is more 
than 
capable 
of 
making 
cohesive, enjoyable albums 
that bridge the gap between 
old-school soul and new-
school R&B. Ventura stands 
as .Paak’s tribute to the 
sounds that have influenced 
him so much. It is a wholly 
enjoyable album in which 
Anderson .Paak displays his 
full range of talents.

.Paak has a return to form

Anderson .Paak

Aftermath Entertainment

Don’t see “The Aftermath.” 
Where 
do 
I 
start? 
The 
screenplay is uninspired and 
predictable. The plot is dull and 
straightforward, 
borrowing 
heavily from the litany of other 
WWII films. The film tracks 
the 
developing 
romance between 
Stefan 
Lubert 
(Alexander 
Skarsgård, 
“Straw 
Dogs”) 
and Ms. Morgan 
(Kiera Knightley, 
“Atonement”), 
after 
Colonel 
Lewis 
Morgan 
(Jason 
Clarke, 
“Zero 
Dark 
Thirty”) and his 
wife 
requisition 
Lubert’s house in 
Hamburg 
after 
the Allied Victory. 
What appears to 
be a half-hearted 
attempt to infuse 
the 
film 
with 
meaning through an aversion 
to Naziism is unsuccessful, 
leaving “The Aftermath” weak 
and soulless.
Much of the drama in the 
film seems exploitative against 
the post-war backdrop. Out 
of pity, Lewis allows Stefan 
and his daughter Freda (Flora 
Thiemann, 
“Tigermilch”) 
to 
stay in the house but asks that 
they relocate themselves to 
the cold attic. Lewis is always 
out, conducting his military 
work on the streets of Hamburg 
— streets populated by now-
homeless Germans searching 
for loved ones in the rubble 
and ashes. Ms. Morgan, lonely 
and missing her son who died 
during 
the 
Blitz, 
ends 
up 
having sex with Herr Lubert 
on the dining-room table after 
her dinner party guests bid 
goodnight.

This rendezvous flourishes 
into an affair after the Colonel 
is called away to the “Russian 
Zone” to deal with an unnamed 
Nazi who offers nothing in 
terms of plot development, 
aside perhaps from an attempt 
at 
showing 
the 
Colonel’s 
merciful nature. While he’s 
away, Rachel and Stefan don 
very stylish outfits and go 

stroll in the woods to Lubert’s 
well-furnished 
cabin. 
Here, 
they have more sex. During 
one of these trysts, the viewer 
is treated to an unexpected 
and very full-frame shot of 
Alexander Skarsgård kissing 
Kiera 
Knightley’s 
nipples. 
Rachel and Stefan plan to run 
away to the Alps once Lewis 
returns from his trip. They 
make it all the way to the 
train platform before Rachel 
gets cold feet and runs back to 
her husband, now that he has 
proved to her that he actually 
does miss his dead son. This 
overused “running away but 
turning back at the last second” 
business plays as predictably as 
you might imagine.
The acting is terrible, though 
the 
lackadaisical 
screenplay 
might have something to do 
with that. In particular, Jason 

Clarke 
gives 
a 
passionless 
performance. 
Skarsgård 
manages to inject fervor here 
and there, but he leans into 
stereotypical German stoicism 
at the expense of originality. 
Knightley too, adds little of 
herself to the role; the romantic 
arc 
between 
Rachel 
and 
Stefan could easily be plopped 
into another setting without 
changing 
a 
thing. The Nazi 
drama is mere 
ornament. 
I 
found 
myself 
looking at my 
watch 
after 
only an hour. I 
feel that it isn’t 
often that I see 
a truly bad film. 
Some 
things 
just 
don’t 
speak 
to 
me 
(like the recent 
“Mandy,” 
starring 
Nicolas 
Cage) 
but I appreciate 
the 
aesthetic 
or 
literary 
value. This one, 
though … yikes.
I’ll 
give 
director 
James 
Kent (“Testament of Youth.”) 
one compliment: The filming 
locations are gorgeous. The 
German forest and chic cabin, 
the 
beautiful 
wood-paneled 
great room with a Mies van der 
Rohe chair and Steinway piano, 
the river views from the balcony 
– all gorgeous. Honestly, stitch 
the b-roll together and you’d 
have a lovely short film. And a 
thank you to casting director 
Arwa Salmanova; Alexander 
Skarsgård and Kiera Knightley 
are at the very least nice to look 
at.
“The Aftermath” is a flop. 
If you’re into cheesy romance 
and WWII period pieces, be 
my guest. If you’re after a 
thoughtful and original work 
of art, this is not the film you’re 
looking for.

‘The Aftermath’ is a total
and utter mess of a movie

The Aftermath

Michigan Theater

Fox Searchlight Pictures

Sunday 
afternoon 
at 
the Michigan Theater, the 
Monterey 
Jazz 
Festival 
concluded its month long 
U.S. and Canada tour. The 
Monterey Jazz Festival has 
been around for over 50 years, 
putting 
together 
diverse 
and international millennial 
talent who are blazing trails 
for the future of top level 
jazz music. Having originally 
come to this concert to see 
millennial 
jazz 
prodigy 
Cecile McLorin Salvant, I 
was excited when I gazed at 
the merchandise table and 
saw multiple artists’ albums 
for sale.
Salvant, 
winner 
of 
the 
Thelonious 
Monk 
International 
Jazz 
Competition as well as three 
Grammy awards for “Best 
Jazz Vocal Album,” held down 
the majority of vocals. She 
started by looking out into 
the house. “Take a moment 
to appreciate who’s around 
you,” said Salvant. Her voice 
held 
incredible 
vibrancy 

and control, as she expertly 
flipped from a classic swing 
number to an acapella folk 
song. Intermittently, Salvant 
would leave the stage, and the 
charming 
drummer-singer, 
Jamison Ross, would take 
over vocals.
It 
was 
clear 
that 
the 
ensemble 
adored 
their 
art form. They all were in 
conversation, 
joking 
with 
each other and the audience 
the entire time. They weren’t 
afraid to address the audience 
directly as they explained 
their backgrounds and why 
they chose to perform the 
songs that spoke to them as 
artists. 
The 
ensemble’s 
ability 
to storytell was incredibly 
impactful. They were able 
to communicate such depth 
of 
emotion 
through 
their 
intermingling 
sounds 
that 
the audience gave a standing 
ovation 
mid-show. 
There 
were a multitude of times 
that I found my steely self 
blubbering like a baby during 
arrangements. They weren’t 
a typical, male dominated 
jazz band either — a woman 
in front of me exclaimed 

“They’re all women!” once 
they filled onstage.
Melissa 
Aldana, 
tenor 
saxophone player, was the 
first female instrumentalist 
and first ever South American 
to win the Thelonious Monk 
Competition. Aldana played 
her original composition “El 
Castillo” from her time spent 
at Lincoln Center in New York 
City. Immediately following 
was 
five 
time 
Grammy 
nominated 
piano 
player 
Christian Sands. Sands played 
an arrangement of Puccini’s 
“Tosca” along with the help 
of bass, played by Tokyo born 
Yasushi Nakamura, and Ross 
on drums. The arrangement 
left everyone in the audience 
on their feet. 
The show concluded with 
Canadian born trumpet player 
and singer songwriter Bria 
Skonberg heading a rendition 
of Valaida Snow’s “High Hat.” 
Snow was a Black female 
instrumentalist most known 
for trumpet and vocals in 
the ’30s. People were nearly 
jumping out of their seats 
while singing and dancing 
to the ending of a perfectly 
thrilling performance.

“You’re no longer the underdog”
How Michigan women’s lacrosse learned how to win

Before the start of the season in 
February, coach Hannah Nielsen 
set up a board with challenging 
but attainable goals for her team.
Finish over .500. The Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team, in its five 
years of existence, had never had 
a winning season.
A winning record in Big Ten 
play. The Wolverines had never 
done that either — or even won 
more than two games.
Make the Big Ten Tournament. 
The last time that happened was 
2016, back before there were just 
four teams in the tournament. 
Michigan 
was 
winless 
in 
conference that year and exited 
unceremoniously with a 20-5 loss 
to Northwestern. Its presence 
was not missed.
Follow team values, on and off 
the field. The mantra upon which 
Nielsen bases her culture.
Now, the Wolverines have 
done all those things.
They’re 14-2, having already 
clinched an undefeated home 
record and a spot in the Big 
Ten Tournament. Those old 
objectives have been checked 
off and replaced by new ones 
— ones that seemed completely 
unrealistic just months ago.
Make the Big Ten Tournament 
championship game.
Get a bid to the NCAA 
Tournament.
Win the opening contest there.
“There was no specific mile 
marker for what we were going 
to achieve and when,” Nielsen 
said. “I set out, when I took over 
the program, to build this team 
into the best it could possibly 
be, the quickest it could possibly 
get there. But at the same time, 
it needed to be done in the right 
way. … So to be where we’re at is 
kind of — it’s excellent.”
In one season, the team that 
was once a cautionary tale on the 
difficulties of starting up a high-
major lacrosse program from 
scratch has become a success 
story.
***
Nielsen came into Michigan in 
2018 as one of the most decorated 
lacrosse players of all time, a 
four-time 
national 
champion 
and 
three-time 
All-American 
at Northwestern who set three 
NCAA assists records during her 
career.
She’d won everywhere she’d 
been. She’d won so much that 
she’d 
never 
experienced 
a 
losing season — not as a player, 
not during assistant coaching 
stints at Penn State, Towson or 
Northwestern, not even when 

she was an assistant at Colorado 
in the first two years of the 
program’s existence.
With the Buffaloes, Nielsen 
learned how to build a team from 
scratch. She took the lessons she 
learned about laying a foundation 
with her to Ann Arbor, but this 
was her toughest task yet. After 
all, Colorado was a blank slate. At 
Michigan, losing was all anyone 
knew.

As recruits in 2014, senior 
goalkeeper 
Mira 
Shane 
and 
senior attacker Adriana Pendino 
— along with several other East 
Coast commits — attended the 
Wolverines’ 
inaugural 
game, 
at Villanova. They watched as 
Michigan scored the first goal 
only to eventually fall, 20-7.
For years, that was what the 
program was. Any sparks of 
hope were quickly extinguished 
en route to constant defeats. 
To survive in that environment 
almost requires a numbness to 
failure, a numbness rarely found 
in high-level athletes.
Nielsen saw that first-hand 
in her debut as head coach. 
Following a 20-10 loss to the 
Buffaloes, the players boarded 
the bus, laughing and talking like 
normal. So Nielsen stepped in 
and addressed her team.
That’s not OK. You can’t be 
coming onto the bus laughing 
after a first game where you lost 
by 10.
Two days later, Michigan lost 
to Jacksonville. Again, there was 
a sense that it was just fine. The 
Wolverines hadn’t played badly, 
per se. The defense was alright. 
They scored more goals than they 
usually did.
When Nielsen let them know 
that their complacency wouldn’t 
fly, it came as a shock.
“We were OK with losing 
because that was the culture 
around 
Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse earlier, previously,” said 
sophomore midfielder Maggie 
Kane. “And so when we were 

losing a lot of those games, it was 
obviously frustrating. But I think 
everybody was just used to it.”
Nielsen worked to rebuild her 
program’s culture from the inside 
out. She knew it would take time, 
and she wanted to make sure it was 
done the right way. Nielsen’s goal 
was to change the team’s mindset 
and to establish the values 
of 
accountability, 
consistent 
improvement 
and 
leadership 

by example. Her methods were 
stricter than previous coaches, 
but she simultaneously made 
sure her team had fun, gelled 
with each other and played with 
confidence.
Her biggest message to the 
team was the first step of building 
a winning culture:
“You’re 
never 
gonna 
go 
anywhere if you don’t set your 
expectations high.”
***
It was the last game of the 2018 
season, and once again, it was 
meaningless.
The Wolverines were in State 
College for a tilt with No. 16 Penn 
State. They weren’t going to finish 
over .500 or make the Big Ten 
Tournament. They had nothing 
left to play for but themselves.
But sometimes, when pride is 
the only thing on the line, funny 
things happen.
With 
seven 
seconds 
left, 
Michigan trailed by one. With 
six seconds left, Molly Garrett 
picked up a ground ball and 
shoveled a pass to Catherine 
Granito. Granito’s shot plopped 
into the top of the net. The game 
was tied.
With one second left, Kane 
sprinted down the field after 
winning a draw, took a last-ditch 
blind shot and stood, speechless, 
watching the net ripple as her 
shot went in. She looked around to 
see if anyone else had processed 
what had just happened.
Everyone 
was 
speechless. 
Then, they began jumping up and 
down and embracing each other.

“I think I peed my pants,” 
Shane said.
The Wolverines had won, 
11-10, beating a ranked team 
for the first time — ever. To this 
day, they get chills watching the 
replay.
It was the first time all the 
puzzle pieces clicked. Michigan 
was 
nowhere 
near 
a 
real 
championship, but this could be 
its little championship, the small 

victory to pave the road for bigger 
ones.
“We realized what a good, 
big win felt like,” Kane said. “I 
think everyone geared up and 

was like, ‘Wow, that isn’t OK to 
lose to these teams that are even 
mediocre, and it feels awesome to 
beat a top-20 team.’ ”
Suddenly, drawn in by the 
taste of victory, Michigan had 
confidence and momentum going 
into the 2019 season. It was a 
lethal combination.
On Feb. 26, the 5-0 Wolverines 
faced a three-goal deficit at No. 9 
Denver with less than 15 minutes 
remaining. At altitude, on the 
road, against a ranked team, 
Michigan stormed back to win, 
12-10.
“I think win after win, game 
after game, when we were 1-0, 
2-0, 3-0, 4-0, all the way up, it 
was like we went into each and 
every game, the following game, 
like, ‘We will win this game,’” 
Pendino said. “Not, ‘We can win 
this game,’ or ‘We might win this 
game.’ So I think the confidence 
aspect 
just 
came 
with 
our 
success.”
The first step in learning 
how to win was setting the 
expectation of winning as the 
norm. The second — winning 
close games and coming from 
behind — came in Denver.
Through February and March, 
the Wolverines kept winning, 
stretching their streak to 13 
games with their first-ever win 
over No. 18 Johns Hopkins on 
March 30. But the unexpected 
success 
wasn’t 
without 
its 
drawbacks.
“The hardest struggle was 
with winning, you’re no longer 
the underdog,” Pendino said. 
“People have more expectations 
and there was pressure.”
As the wins mounted so did 
the pressure. Michigan had never 

before faced the phenomenon of 
a winning streak, of each game 
feeling more and more important 
and more and more like a burden.
“As the ladder kept climbing, 
where it was just like six, seven, 
eight, nine, it was like, ‘Oh my 
God, I’m really happy, but holy 
moly,’ ” Shane said. “And the 
stage got bigger. I think that 
people were definitely rising to 
the occasion but … it was hard at 
some point.
“It’s hard to know how to win 
and this program hasn’t known 
how to do it in the past and I 
think Hannah and our whole 
entire coaching staff is teaching 
us how to do that, to walk away 
with — even if you feel like there’s 
pressure, how do you rise to the 
occasion and come off the field no 
matter what, with a win?”
In its 13-game winning streak, 
Michigan learned how to do that. 
But then came the third step: 
learning how to lose again.
Not losing chronically, like the 
Wolverines did before, but losing 
— as all teams do — and coming 
back from it.
On April 6, Michigan scored 
the first goal of the game against 
Maryland, then the No. 2 team 
in the country. An hour later, the 
Wolverines had to deal with the 
consequences of a 14-3 drubbing 

by the Terrapins.
“It was really just a relief to 
get the one loss out of the way,” 
Nielsen said. “Get it early-ish 
in the campaign, I’d rather lose 
in April than lose in May. So it 
was just, it was a really good 
measuring stick, and to come 
back and reflect on the game and 
say, ‘Alright, guys, we need to be 
better. We need to be a little bit 
more confident in what we’re 
doing, play a little harder, play a 
little faster.’ ”
While Nielsen focused on 
the positives, the players were 
crushed. It was a far cry from 
the athletes who had laughed 
on the bus after a loss to a team 
far inferior to Maryland. The 
complacency was gone, but in the 
immediate aftermath, so was the 
confidence that had carried the 
team so far. A year after working 
to teach her team that losing was 
never OK, it was up to Nielsen to 
pick Michigan back up after the 
suddenly forgotten phenomenon 
of defeat.
That, in itself, showed just 
how much the expectations had 
shifted.
The coaches had a pulse on 

their athletes. Practice that week 
was light and fun, designed to get 
the Wolverines back on board and 
ready for the rest of their season. 
This time, they’d earned it.
And in a way, the loss took 
the pressure off. No longer 
was each game the one that 
threatened to end the streak. 
Instead, each successive win 
would be gravy. The following 
week, the Wolverines clinched 
an undefeated home record by 
beating Rutgers, something that 
seemed unthinkable just months 
before.
Nielsen always pushed her 
players to think bigger and set 
loftier goals. Now, as they’ve 
thought bigger and won bigger, 
she’s struggling to temper her 
own expectations as the bar for 
success gets higher.
“You win games and your 
expectation levels get higher and 
higher and you forget to just sort 
of reflect and say, ‘We’re probably 
not supposed to be here,’ ” Nielsen 
said. “And so we’re a little harder 
on them than maybe we need to 
be sometimes.”
But even if the season does end 
in disappointment for Nielsen, it 
will be a symptom of the winning 
culture 
she’s 
successfully 
established. Even her talk of April 
losses being preferable to May 

losses would have been unheard 
of before, when May lacrosse 
existed simply as a figment of 
their collective imaginations.
Michigan is no longer the 
laughingstock. Now, it’s a team 
that could play a few weeks 
into May if everything breaks 
right. Nielsen, of course, is no 
stranger to postseason lacrosse 
and the way that anything can 
happen there. She sees that in the 
Wolverines’ future — if not quite 
this year, then soon, because with 
the foundation she built, the sky 
is the limit. Finally, the team 
is full of people who — top to 
bottom — know how to win.
Nielsen has teased the players 
about her experiences with May 
lacrosse, but she hasn’t gone into 
too much detail. She wants them 
to stay hungry, after all — and 
she wants them to experience the 
feeling for themselves.
To know they’re more than 
capable, all she has to do is look at 
how her goal board has changed 
since February.
To know they’re more than 
capable, all she has to do is look at

Michigan prepares for nationals

In order to be the best, you 
have to compete against the best.
The best teams can thrive 
under pressure. And thrive when 
it is super close.
Can’t break steel.
Bev Plocki has been giving 
her team of 14 gymnasts these 
nuggets of wisdom all season, 
and for the thirty years she’s been 
Michigan’s women’s gymnastics 
coach. 
But this year is something 
different. This group of gymnasts 
is different. This season has 
been so different. So the nuggets 
of 
wisdom, 
naturally, 
mean 
something different. 
The Wolverines have been 
through hell and back. Riddled 
with coaching scandals, injuries, 
and some less-than-stellar scores 
throughout the past few months, 
they have been in the spotlight 
and a topic of conversation 
throughout 
the 
gymnastics 
world. 
However, as of late, Michigan 
has been making waves for all 
the right reasons. After tying 
for second place at the Missouri 
Quad Meet on Feb. 15, a meet 
they were highly favored to win, 
the Wolverines bounced back 
to convincingly win the Big 
Ten Championship. And then, 
riding the momentum of their 
conference title, marginally beat a 
talented Alabama team to qualify 
for the National Championship. 
And this was no easy feat. 
The NCAA changed the format 
of nationals at the beginning 
of 
the 
season, 
consequently 
allowing four less teams to 
advance to the championship 
round. There is an initial duel 
meet to determine the last team 
in to compete at regionals, and 
then there are two sessions of 
four teams competing on the 
first day. The top two teams from 
each of those sessions advance 
to compete in the regional final 
the following day, and the top 

two teams from the regional 
competition advance to nationals. 
Michigan, ranked seventh in 
the country, is now one of the 
eight teams that performed at 
the caliber that allowed them 
to advance from their regional 
competitions to compete on the 
biggest stage. The Wolverines are 
ready. And they know it. 
“I think the biggest thing for 
us is going to be believing that we 
belong,” said junior captain Lexi 
Funk. “Because, you know, it was 
a big deal for us to get to nationals, 
especially because they changed 
the format and there’s less teams 
that get to go. But there’s no 
reason that we don’t belong at 
nationals. There’s no reason that 
we can’t qualify to the final day. 
There’s no reason we can’t win.”
Though 
the 
2018-2019 
season isn’t over yet, Michigan 
has already outperformed its 
previous season. The Wolverines 
had a solid record, then won the 
Big Ten Championship, but failed 
to qualify for nationals. 
So, as a team that thrives in the 
face of adversity and missteps, 
they made sure that wouldn’t 
happen again and — in this team’s 
fashion — have found the silver 
lining in the dark clouds from the 
past. 
“Since we didn’t make it to 
nationals last year, we’re already 
a step ahead of where we were 
last year,” said Funk. “So I think 

I just want to go into nationals 
giving nothing but 110 percent 
and just enjoying all of the 
experiences that come along with 
it. … We’ve had such a good team 
chemistry this year and this is 
our last meet all together, so I 
think just enjoying each other’s 
company and just ending it with a 
bang. That’s all we can ask to do.”
Along with a stacked roster 
of accomplished athletes that 
continue to impress with every 
next competition, Michigan has 
one outstanding quality that has 
given it the ability to outshine the 
ups and downs of the season: its 
chemistry.
“It makes all the difference 
having that kind of a team 
dynamic,” Funk said. “… When 
you’re competing, you’re up on 
that event all by yourself. And I 
look around on floor while I’m 
dancing and I see my team doing 
my choreography with me on the 
sidelines. It’s comforting to see 
that my teammates are having 
fun with me and they want me 
to do well so that we can all 
do well together. And I think 
you can see the great dynamic 
that we have in the meets — we 
obviously say that, but I think 
you can see that in our actions … 
it’s indescribable.”
