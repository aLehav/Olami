CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In Iowa speech,

Obama announces 
initiative to adjust 

FAFSA deadline

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

With the aim of helping more 

Americans see college as an 
affordable 
option, 
President 

Barack 
Obama 
announced 
a 

new initiative to align the Free 
Application for Federal Student 
Aid due date more closely with 
college applications. 

Obama’s 
plan, 
which 
he 

announced 
Monday 
in 
Iowa, 

would potentially move FAFSA’s 
application date to October — 
rather than its current January 
due date, which falls months after 
students have already applied to 
college. The changes will go into 
effect in the 2017-2018 fiscal year.

FAFSA is a mechanism to check 

students’ eligibility for federal and 
state government scholarships, 

grants and loans. It is also used by 
higher education institutions to 
determine how much financial aid 
to allot students.

Packing college acceptances 

with delivery of financial aid 
packages is something that the 
University has been working 
toward in the last year. In an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily 
earlier 
this 
month, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said these efforts could 
result in “modest incremental 
changes 
in 
the 
direction 
of 

diversity.”

As a result, Kedra Ishop, 

associate 
vice 
president 
for 

enrollment 
management 

at 
the 
University, 
sees 
the 

announcement as positive for both 
higher education institutions and 
students.

“The president’s order makes 

the financial aid timetable much 
more palatable for families and 
will broaden what they think is 
possible for themselves,” she said. 
“This is a win-win for both our 
University and our students and

SACUA meeting 
addresses diversity 

plan, excessive 

alcohol consumption

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

More classes might be offered 

only early Friday morning next 
semester — and it is no accident.

University Provost Martha 

Pollack presented two key issues 
Monday for the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs’ consideration: diversity 
and 
student 
drinking. 
One 

suggestion she made to SACUA 
members in regard to quelling 
campus 
drinking 
involved 

increasing 
the 
number 
of 

large 
enrollment 
classes 
on 

Friday mornings, in addition 
to encouraging faculty to give 
short talks about the dangers of 

excessive alcohol consumption 
in class.

On the topic of quelling 

excessive 
student 
drinking, 

Pollack said faculty involvement 
could play an important role.

Art & Design Prof. Anne 

Mondro, a SACUA member, said 
it might be helpful if faculty 
suggested dry events to students 
in class.

“Let us say, ‘Hey, here’s a 

whole list of other events that are 
happening.’ ” she said.

Greek and Latin Prof. David 

Potter, a SACUA member, said the 
solution must involve changing 
the school’s image and culture.

“One of the difficulties is that 

students come here with the 
expectation of partying,” Potter 
said. “They’re told this is a four-
day school.”

Before classes commenced 

last week, the University rolled 
out a package of new initiatives 
designed to combat drinking on

ACADEMICS

Administrators lack 

nuance to reach 
target audience 
with mass event

By THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Editorial Board

For the first time in University 

of Michigan Greek life’s 170-year 
history, chapter members from all 
four councils — Interfraternity, 
Panhellenic, 
National 
Pan-

Hellenic 
and 
Multicultural 

— were required to meet with 
administrators 
last 
Thursday 

evening to discuss party culture 
and how it affects perceptions of 
our school. With problems such as 
sexual assault and alcohol abuse 
disproportionately affecting Greek 
life members, it’s obvious some 
sort of action is required. However, 
administrators should not be led 
to believe that holding a large 
meeting, during which they talked 
at instead of with members, was 
a productive use of time. Instead, 
they should realize they failed 
to engage their target audience 
and made little, if no progress in 
initiating needed reforms.

Each chapter was required 

to send at least 70 percent of its 
members to the meeting at Hill 
Auditorium or else face a semester 
of social probation, a letter to their 
national organization and a $1,000 
fine. Perhaps due to this attendance 
requirement, the mass meeting 
was met with some resistance. 
Members of the crowd disrupted 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel and other members of the 
administration with loud coughs 

and laughter when issues such 
as alcohol abuse, sexual assault 
and other problems pertaining to 
Greek life were discussed.

However, this behavior did not 

go unreprimanded. Alex Krupiak, 
the 2015 IFC executive board 
president, ended the meeting by 
commenting on the disrespectful 
behavior as “flat-out embarrassing” 
for the entirety of Greek life. While 
only a small minority of members 
displayed this massive immaturity, 
it demonstrated stomach-churning 
ignorance toward the serious 
issues facing Greek life that must 
be addressed.

That said, the initiative to bridge 

gaps between Greek life and the 
administration 
was 
admirable. 

However, the lack of awareness 
within 
the 
administration 

about the underlying roots from 
which alcohol abuse, property 
destruction and sexual assaults 
stem, coupled with the “not in 
my backyard” attitudes of some 
students 
involved 
in 
Greek 

life, resulted in an ineffective 
dialogue that sought to appeal to 
emotions instead of proposing real, 
substantive changes.

During 
the 
meeting, 
the 

University called on members 
of Greek life to internally create 
a 
more 
constructive 
campus 

culture 
and 
lead 
progress 

toward upholding school values. 
However, administrators stated 
they couldn’t find short-term 
solutions for the cultural problems 
permeating campus, and didn’t 
give specific policy suggestions 
that could provide a framework 
for the student-led changes to 
occur. While members of Greek 
life ultimately decide how they

Scott Campbell, associate professor of Urban Planning and a member of the Pedestrian Safety and Access Task Force, 
presented objectives on making changes to protect pedestrians to the Ann Arbor City Council on Monday.

Task force offers 
proposals intended 
to reduce pedestrian 
fatalities, accidents

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Pedestrians in Ann Arbor, 

many of whom are students 
and young people, are at risk of 
injury according to a recent study 
conducted by Ann Arbor officials.

Vision Zero — an initiative 

endorsed 
by 
the 
city’s 

Pedestrian Safety and Task 
Force Committee that strives 
to eliminate fatalities or serious 
injuries to pedestrians — was 
presented to the Ann Arbor 

City Council Monday night 
in an attempt to address this 
issue, along with survey results 
reguarding pedestrian safety in 
Ann Arbor. The report included 
several 
policy 
proposals, 

including improved crosswalks 
and a ban on using hand-held 
devices for drivers.

Though Ann Arbor crashes 

involving pedestrians represent 
only 16 percent of all crashes, 
pedestrians account for one-third 
of the fatalities and one-fourth of 
all serious crash-related injuries. 
The study states that Ann Arbor 
averaged 55 pedestrian crashes 
per year for the five-year period 
2010-2014, which was a 22 percent 
increase from the previous five-
year period.

Council did not vote on 

the report on Monday, but 

will continue to consider the 
proposal at future meetings.

After 17 months of studying 

Ann 
Arbor’s 
road 
system, 

pedestrian fatality and surveying 
the community, the Pedestrian 
Safety and Task Force created 
a 59-page document report. 
Linda Diane Feldt, chair of the 
Pedestrian Safety and Access 
Task Force, said the report was 
created in an effort to have a 
cohesive and effective plan for 
pedestrian safety.

“There 
was 
disconnect 

between 
the 
experience 
of 

those people walking, those in 
cars, and of course, distracted 
roadway users,” Feldt said.

The objectives of the report 

is to improve pedestrian access, 
improve understanding of traffic 

Thursday’s 

meeting agenda 
also set to include 

bond proposal

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

For the most part, the agenda 

for 
Thursday’s 
University 

Board of Regents meeting 
is pretty standard. Pending 
construction projects will be 
up for approval, a new round of 
professors will likely be granted 
tenure and the Central Student 
Government president will give 
his first monthly report of the 
school year.

For this month’s preview, 

The Michigan Daily perused 
the agenda and sifted out 
some of standout items on 
Thursday’s agenda. 

Public Health major

A resolution to create a 

two-year 
major 
program 

through the School of Public 
Health, if passed, would allow 
undergraduate students to 
declare a public health major 
as of the fall 2016 semester.

The program will focus on 

“the importance of critical 
thinking applied to important 
health problems of the 21st 
century,” according to an 
action request written by 
Provost Martha Pollack and 
Martin Philbert, dean of the

Medical School hosts admissions chat

‘U’ alum announces 
candidacy for House

Group of current 
students answer 
questions about 

admissions process

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
Medical 

School’s admissions office took 
to Twitter on Monday night, 
answering questions during an 
hour-long live chat with prospec-
tive students who had questions 
about the admissions process.

Students interested in apply-

ing to the M.D. program tweeted 
questions and concerns to @
UMichMedAdmiss and including 
#GoBlueMed in their 140-char-
acter posts.

Eight current Medical School 

students helped run the Twitter 
account, providing first-person 

stories to help answer questions.

A prevalent concern among 

the prospective students was 
the availability of research and 
extracurricular 
opportunities 

at Michigan. In addition, many 
applicants asked about student 
life in Ann Arbor, as well as study 
abroad and volunteering oppor-
tunities.

“The faculty/staff here are 

incredibly responsive to your 
interests in clinical and basic 
science research,” the Medi-
cal School Admissions Twitter 
replied. “Students are happy, 
mentorship and support are 
amazing, (and there are) many 
strong research programs.”

According to U.S. News, the 

University Medical School cur-
rently ranks 10th nationally in 
research and fifth nationally in 
primary care. For the class of 
2014, 10.1 percent of 5,776 appli-
cants were interviewed, and 177 
were eventually admitted.

The Twitter chat also revealed 

an interest among prospective 
students in patient care in under-
represented or underserved pop-
ulations.

“How does learning to practice 

medicine in Ann Arbor contribute 
to one’s preparedness for serving 
the underserved?” one Twitter 
user, Meghan Schmitt, asked.

“Our Doctoring and Patient 

Centered Care parts of the cur-
riculum prepare us to work with 
the underserved,” the admissions 
profile wrote. “And there are 
opportunities to volunteer with 
homeless/uninsured 
popula-

tions in Detroit and around (Ann 
Arbor).”

Many 
students, 
including 

Nicole Elmblad, Michigan Wom-
en’s Basketball guard, inquired 
about the student culture and 
sense of cooperation among M.D. 
candidates.

“How’s the student culture?” 

Elmblad asked. “Is there more of 

a sense of working together (ver-
sus) competing among students?”

“There’s definitely a sense of 

huge collaboration among class-
mates,” the profile replied. “I’ve 
yet to see real competition among 
my classmates.”

In response to a prospective 

student, a second-year Medi-
cal student answering ques-
tions from the account who 
identified herself by the hashtag 
“#MeghanM2” echoed the senti-
ment of collaboration.

“My classmates are definitely 

the best part,” she wrote. “They 
bring so many different perspec-
tives and ideas.”

Medical School Admissions, 

in addition to pointing out the 
diversity of student culture and 
extracurricular 
opportunities 

available, noted that the Medical 
School offers about $10 million 
in aid to students each year.

The next Twitter chat will be 

hosted on Oct. 7.

Yousef Rabhi to 
run in Michigan’s 

53rd district

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Washtenaw County Commis-

sioner Yousef Rabhi announced his 
candidacy for state representative 
to the 53rd Michigan House Dis-
trict in the Buhr Park Children’s 
Wet Meadow Project Monday 
afternoon.

Rabhi said he chose to launch 

his candidacy at the park because 
it was the place that spurred his 
political career — when he was in 
pre-school.

“This is where I realized, not 

only the power of the environment 
and nature to make good change, 
but the power of community to 
come together and make it hap-
pen,” he said.

In his address to his supporters 

and family, he noted some of the 
change he brought to Washtenaw 
County as commissioner, includ-
ing building a community dental 
clinic for low-income residents, 
passing preferred ordinances for 
local and environmentally-friendly 
businesses and extending munici-
pal ID cards to residents without 
other forms of identification, such 
as undocumented immigrants, the 

elderly and those living under the 
poverty line.

While creating programs to spur 

social justice, Rabhi said he also 
produced a balanced municipal 
budget for four years and achieved 
a triple-A bond rating for the first 
time in Washtenaw County histo-
ry. He said his success both socially 
and economically proves him a 
worthy contender for the race.

“This shows you that you can 

have fiscal stability and you can 
have social change all in one,” he 
said. “One does not have to com-
promise the other, we can work on 
both and still achieve a better com-
munity.”

Rabhi has resided in Ann Arbor 

his entire life, attending Huron 
High School and earning a bach-
elor’s degree in environmental sci-
ence from the University in 2010. 
Along with being county commis-
sioner, he works full-time at the 
Matthaei Botanical Gardens and 
Nichols Arboretum. 

City Councilmember Sabra Bri-

ere endorsed Rabhi and attended 
the event in support of his cam-
paign.

She said his ability to work 

within a local community, as well 
as enthusiasm and dedication to 
his job, made him an outstanding 
county commissioner.

Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, “to develop a 
curriculum for student-athletes 
to learn about sexual assault 
prevention and raise awareness 
about this issue.”

Funding campus construction
Kevin Hegarty, executive vice 

president and chief financial 
officer, has submitted an action 
request for the University to 
issue general revenue bonds. If 
approved, proceeds are estimated 
not to exceed $110 million.

Bonds are often issues by 

companies or institutions needing 
to raise money. How it works: 
Investors loan the institution, in 
this case the University, a specific 
amount of money in exchange 
for periodic interest payments. 
The loan is repaid when the bond 
reaches maturity.

The funds brought in by 

these 
bonds 
would 
pay 
for 

recently completed and ongoing 
renovation projects — including 
the Munger Graduate Residences, 
Intramural Sports Building and 
Central Campus utility tunnel 
reinforcements.

“The 
University 
seeks 
to 

provide 
long 
term 
financing 

for the construction cash flow 
requirements of authorized new 
projects,” the action request reads.

The plan would also likely 

involve refinancing “commercial 
paper,” or money issued by 
corporations or institutions to 
help them meet short-term debt 
obligations — in the University’s 
case, 
this 
refers 
to 
money 

that went toward funding the 
collective renovation of West 
Quad and the Michigan Union 
Cambridge House.

Subsequently, total proceeds 

from 
issuing 
bonds 
and 

refinancing “is not expected to 
exceed $435 million.”

“These bonds, like commercial 

paper, will be supported by a 
pledge of the University’s General 
Revenues,” the action request 
reads. General Revenues refers 
to 
“revenues 
from 
students, 

athletics, housing” and a plethora 
of other University cash flows.

campus. Central to that effort is 
a plan to alert the parents of first-
year students who incur a second 
violation 
of 
the 
University’s 

alcohol policies. The University’s 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security also plans to increase 
engagement efforts in off-campus 
neighborhoods.

Citing 
current 
work 
to 

develop a campus-wide diversity 

initiative, Pollack asked members 
of 
SACUA 
to 
consider 
how 

the faculty governance could 
be involved with the ongoing 
planning process.

Last 
week, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel said 
the University would finalize a 
campus-wide strategic diversity 
plan by the end of the school year. 
For now, Schlissel said individual 
University units and departments 
would play a role in suggesting 
policy changes or new initiatives 
designed to improve equity and 
inclusion at the University — a 

process in which faculty are 
expected to play a key role.

Kinesiology 
Prof. 
Stefan 

Szymanski, a SACUA member, 
suggested the University improve 
its outreach efforts in Detroit.

“Walking 
down 
Woodward 

Avenue 
there’s 
a 
wonderful 

building 
with 
MSU 
slogans 

everywhere and big bold letters 
everywhere, and then we have 
a little building with little block 
‘M’s and it just seemed very 
striking,” he said.

While Pollack acknowledged 

that the University needs to 

families.”

FAFSA has already changed 

dramatically under the Obama 
administration. Last January, the 
president announced significant 
cuts to the application’s length, 
shaving the process down by 
approximately 20 minutes to 
make applying easier and faster.

University alum Cecilia Muñoz, 

director of the White House 
Domestic Policy Council, and 
Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of 
Education, further explained the 
new initiative in a media phone 
conference Monday afternoon.

Muñoz said the administration 

decided to change FAFSA’s due 
date because the current January 
deadline falls during a time where 
filing taxes for most families 

coincides with FAFSA deadlines 
and 
the 
release 
of 
college 

decisions.

“These 
changes 
will 

essentially eliminate the largest 
roadblocks to FAFSA completion, 
as well as this truncated time 
period during which people — 
students and their families — are 
making what could be the most 
important financial decision of 
their lives,” Muñoz said. “So this 
administrative effort is going 
to mean an easier, and earlier, 
FAFSA.”

Currently FAFSA uses a tax 

retrieval tool to fill-in financial 
information, 
which 
is 
only 

available to families after they 
have filed their taxes. Four-
million students currently file 
their FAFSA information prior to 
their taxes.

Now, 
family 
income 

information will be evaluated 

from each of the two years prior 
to a student’s college application 
— or “prior-prior year data” — to 
determine if income has changed 
significantly over that period of 
time. The change will make it 
easier for families to record their 
financial data.

Mark 
Kantrowitz, 
senior 

vice president and publisher of 
edvisors.com, is an expert on 
student financial aid and said 
the shift to using prior-prior year 
data will have a serious impact 
on students’ financial aid and 
graduation rate.

“Prior-prior year will also 

yield an improvement in college 
graduation rates,” Kantrowitz 
said. “Currently, about 2 million 
low income students don’t file 
the FAFSA, even though they 
would qualify for a Federal Pell 
Grant. Some don’t do it because 
of the complexity of the form. 

Some don’t do it because they 
are enrolled at low-cost colleges 
and think they can work their 
way through college. But people 
who work a full-time job are half 
as likely to graduate as students 
who work 12 hours or less a 
week. Some don’t do it because 
they think they aren’t eligible for 
grants, just for loans. So, making 
the process easier will encourage 
more students to file the FAFSA. 
If these students then use the 
financial aid to reduce their work 
hours, they will be more likely to 
graduate.”

Duncan said he believes the 

changes will help students and 
families make more informed 
decisions earlier.

“We think this small step to 

make students’ lives easier could 
have a huge impact over time,” 
Duncan said. “We’re estimating 
that over the next several years, 

literally hundreds of thousands of 
additional students will actually 
gain access to critical student 
aid each year because more 
students and their families will 
find it easier to apply for that aid. 
That’s financial aid that students 
absolutely need and deserve, and 
that historically, sadly, they were 
leaving on the table.”

Pamela W. Fowler, executive 

director 
of 
the 
University’s 

Office of Financial Aid, said the 
University is eager to get started 
with the new changes.

“Those of us in the higher-

education field have advocated 
for this change for some time,” 
Fowler said. “This is a positive 
move for our students and 
families and will allow our 
prospective families to assess 
their financial situation earlier in 
the decision-making process.”

laws, improve the physical 
conditions of the roadway, 
address the safety and access 
for 
all 
users 
and 
reduce 

distractions. The task force 
said their goal is zero traffic 
fatalities.

The task force surveyed more 

than 1,000 members of the Ann 
Arbor community, as well as 
consulted experts in the field.

“The Task Force wants these 

recommendations to become 
reality and hopes that you 
will work to implement them 
through creation of a formal 
Pedestrian Safety Plan that 
recognizes pedestrian safety 
and access as an important 
component of City policy, and 
practice and one that deserves a 
level of funding commensurate 
with its importance to the City 
and its residents,” Feldt wrote 
in an opening letter to the 
Council.

After 
addressing 
the 

statistics, 
the 
report 
then 

goes on to outline the five 
underlying issues that Council 
and the city of Ann Arbor 
needs to address. These issues 
include the unavailability of 
comfortable and convenient 
sidewalks, 
as 
well 
as 

unfamiliarity 
with 
traffic 

laws, a disconnect between 
roadway 
user 
expectations 

and 
conditions, 
failure 
to 

consider the perspective of all 
transportation system users 
and distracted roadway users.

Members of the Ann Arbor 

community identified a variety 
of potential causes, including 
situations where motorists fail 
to yield for pedestrians, as well 
as snow and ice accumulation 
on sidewalks and speeding in 
residential neighborhoods.

To 
conclude 
the 
report, 

detailed 
descriptions 
of 

how the city could address 
these 
issues. 
Each 
solution 

or 
recommendation 
was 

related back to an objective 
aforementioned in the document.

Scott 
Campbell, 
a 
task 

force 
member, 
presented 

said Council should consider 
different 
ways 
to 
address 

crosswalks on busy roads.

“One of the biggest issues 

that we’ve seen is the danger 
of multi-lane traffic in each 
direction,” Campbell said. “One 
thing recommended is to have 

advanced stop bars, which give 
a good distance between the 
stopped car and the crosswalk.”

Anthony 
Pinnell, 
another 

task force member, discussed 
speeding and distracted driving.

“One idea is implementing 

local ordinance banning hand-
held (devices) and even hands-
free devices,” Pinnell said. “More 
and more states have statewide 
bans and it’s mostly becoming 
a topic because using devices is 
overtaking alcohol accidents.”

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(D–Ward 2) raised questions 
regarding police enforcement 
of pedestrian laws.

“My sense is that there is 

no magic and there aren’t 
officers 
sitting 
around 

doing nothing,” Lumm said. 
“Additional enforcement would 
require more officers, or more 
overtime, therefore some parts 
of policing may be sacrificed.” 

Councilmember 
Stephen 

Kunselman 
(D–Ward 
3) 

wanted to know how the task 
force addressed jaywalking, an 
element that he felt was missing 
from the report.

“We have a lot of young 

pedestrians in the downtown,” 
Kunselman said. “It seems like 
they are the ones that need 
enforcement, not the drivers 
that are trying to dodge them.”

Feldt 
responded 
to 

Kunselman’s question by noting 
that pedestrians are similar in 
behavior to deer. She said that 
one of the best solutions to 
addressing pedestrian safety is 
for motorists to slow down as 
they would for deer.

After 
discussing 
general 

pedestrian safety, the task force 
then addressed snow and ice 
removal in the city.

“Everyone 
is 
demanding 

higher standards when it comes 
to snow and ice removal,” 
Pinnell said. “The current 
ordinance and its enforcement 
are inadequate.”

The solution to inadequate 

snow removal included defining 
an 
exact 
ordinance 
with 

standards that are easy to follow 
and fulfill. The task force also 
recommended low and no-cost 
solutions 
for 
community 

members that need assistance.

The 
task 
force 
also 

empathized to the Council the 
significant effect of inadequate 
snow removal on the elderly 
and disabled citizens of Ann 
Arbor as another issue the 
proposal would address.

Martha Pollack, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, discusses the new HAIL scholarship for high-
achieving, low-income students at a SACUA meeting in the Fleming Administration Building on Monday. The new scholar-
ship program will pay full tuition and fees for four years and make the admissions process more accessible. 

continue to expand its presence 
in Detroit, she also noted the 
University programs already in 
place with that aim.

She said a recent survey 

indicated 
the 
University 
has 

more than 300 research, outreach 
and service initiatives active 
in Detroit. Among them is the 
University’s 
Detroit 
Center, 

which assists local students in 
completing college application 
and FAFSA forms.

SACUA 
member 
Angela 

Fagerlin, associate professor of 
internal 
medicine, 
questioned 

how the University was planning 
to help students from under-
resourced high schools adjust to 
the University’s level of rigor.

“(They) don’t know how to 

interact with the system as well so 
they get lost here among the other 
40,000 kids,” Fagerlin said.

While 
Pollack 
said 
the 

University 
is 
continuing 
to 

develop initiatives to address 
this issue, she pointed to the 
University’s high graduation rate 
as evidence that many students 
are successful here no matter 
their background.

The next SACUA meeting will 

take place Sept. 21.

represent 
themselves, 
these 
organizations 

are also University-sanctioned and operate under 
the University’s jurisdiction. Administrators 
have the power and the responsibility to 
facilitate cultural shifts by establishing concrete 
guidelines and engaging in collaborative 
efforts with student organizations. The 
meeting identified negative aspects of Greek 
life, but ultimately failed to offer genuine 
policy solutions.

The structure and emphasis of the meeting 

were also problematic. E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, remarked in 
an interview with the Michigan Daily that 
the meeting was intended to emphasize the 
University’s concern for students’ health and 
wellness, not to scold them. However, Harper 
made clear at the meeting that others often 
perceive Greek life as racist, homophobic, 
sexist and unsafe. Further, the consensus after 
the meeting reflected disapproval of the event. 

Ultimately, the administration came off as 
punitive, putting many students on the defensive 
and risking creating a rift that could damage 
future efforts to effectively enact policy.

Given that the administration highlighted 

more problems than it provided solutions, and 
that no actual progress is likely to come of it, 
the meeting comes off as a publicity stunt that 
wasn’t meant to cause any tangible change.

Rather than condemn the entirety of Greek 

life, the University should seek to acknowledge 
the positive contributions individual chapters 
make to campus and the community at large. 
Reforms are needed, but generalizing the 
collective behavior of the students within these 
organizations will not bring forth any substantial 
solutions. The problematic actions of individuals, 
or even specific chapters, should not overshadow 
Greek life members who are instituting reforms 
and portraying the University in a positive light. 
To remedy these issues, the University needs to 
modify its approach in order to establish an open 
dialogue and a more cooperative relationship 
with these groups.

N

ews has been pouring out of 
Ann Arbor all summer. No 
matter how far away you 

were from hoMe, whether you were 
studying abroad in Barcelona, intern-
ing on Wall Street, waiting tables on 
Main Street or simply soaking up the 
sun on the shores of Lake Michigan, 
no Wolverine could bear four long 
months without checking in on their 
beloved campus. Between the dawn-
ing of the Harbaugh Era, the open-
ing of Mcity and the renovations on 
North Campus, the summer of 2015 
was by no means uneventful. One 
Ann Arbor resident, Joshua Wade, 
has been particularly busy.

In June, Wade filed a lawsuit 

against the University (which by 
itself is not entirely rare). This case, 
however, has nothing to do with 
affirmative action or sexual miscon-
duct. This case is about gun control.

Wade’s charge is simple: Univer-

sity policy states that no weapons can 
be carried on University campuses 
by anyone other than law enforce-
ment or the military. To Wade, this 
policy violates the rights he finds in 
both the United States and Michigan 
constitutions. He carries weapons 
for the defense of himself and his 
loved ones and “just want(s) U-M 
to come into compliance with state 
law,” because “police unfortunately 
can’t be everywhere … they can’t 
protect everyone, as evidenced by 
the fact that crime happens.” Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
issued a statement shortly thereafter 
announcing that the administration 
will “vigorously defend” their policy 
as a matter of safety.

Most observers of this case will be 

able to see the merits of each side of 
the argument, the complex conflict 
of interest between Mr. Wade’s Sec-
ond Amendment rights and the Uni-
versity’s desire to ensure the safety 
of its students. But in this case, there 

are not two sides. Contrary to popu-
lar opinion and the agenda perpetu-
ated by thousands of gun advocates 
in America today, this case should be 
a no-contest, easy win for the Uni-
versity. Because when it comes to his 
rights, Mr. Wade is absolutely and 
without a doubt dead wrong.

Let’s break down the argument 

in this case. The University can-
not ban the possession of weapons 
on campus because the Second 
Amendment guarantees the right 
to bear arms, right? Wrong, and for 
more than one reason. 

If Joshua Wade read the exact 

phrasing of keystone of his legal 
argument, he would see that the 
amendment begins: “A well-reg-
ulated militia, being necessary to 
the security of a free State…” To the 
founders, the right to bear arms was 
exercised at Lexington and Concord, 
not by Mr. Wade at the corner of Lib-
erty and State streets. Not until 2008 
did the Supreme Court recognize the 
right to bear arms as one belonging 
to the individual. Not 1908, but 2008 
— the year Rich Rodriguez came to 
Michigan, President Barack Obama 
was elected and the No. 1 song on the 
charts was “Low” by Flo Rida. Up 
until then, in Washington D.C. and 
in school zones around the country, 
there were local bans on owning a 
firearm until cases like D.C. v. Hell-
er and United States v. Lopez at the 
Supreme Court changed this (though 
dissent remains).

Perhaps the greatest accomplish-

ment of conservatives on the issue of 
guns is the heinous and widespread 
oversimplification of what the Sec-
ond Amendment says. Americans like 
Mr. Wade tend to adopt summarized 
views of the Bill of Rights. The First 
Amendment gives me the right to 
free speech, the Second Amendment 
says I can bear arms, etc. Reading 
opinions from the Supreme Court, 

however, this is hardly the case.

“The Gun Lobby’s interpretation 

of the Second Amendment is one of 
the greatest pieces of fraud … on the 
American People … that I have ever 
seen in my lifetime. The real purpose 
of the Second Amendment was to 
ensure that state armies — the militia 
— would be maintained for the defense 
of the state. The very language of the 
Second Amendment refutes any argu-
ment that it was intended to guarantee 
every citizen an unfettered right to 
any kind of weapon he or she desires.” 
And this wasn’t one of your run-of-
the-mill liberal justices. This came 
from Warren Burger, stalwart conser-
vative from the Midwest.

Even if the Second Amendment 

read as simply as most people imag-
ine it does, they would still have a 
problem. As star-spangled awesome 
as Americans see themselves, no 
right is absolute. Look no further 
than the conservative champion 
and author of the opinion in the Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Heller decision, 
Justice Antonin Scalia. “Like most 
rights, the Second Amendment right 
is not unlimited. It is not a right to 
keep and carry any weapon whatso-
ever in any manner whatsoever and 
for whatever purpose.”

Misconceptions have made guns 

an integral part of our Constitution, 
and this delusion has gone too far for 
too long. Why Wade cannot see how 
a community that is often plagued 
by sexual assault, depression and 
inebriated college kids would have 
a vested interest in decreasing 
the number of guns on campus is 
beyond me. Read the amendment 
for yourself, free from prejudice or 
preconceived notion. And know that 
gun control is not a liberal fantasy, 
but a modern imperative.

JAMIE BIRCOLL | VIEWPOINT

CLAIRE BRYAN | VIEWPOINT

Dear Mr. Vice President,
As I write this, I am watching 

your interview with Stephen Col-
bert. You crack jokes; you are pen-
sive and reflective. You are at times 
incredibly sad, and then you are 
smiling again. I see you, the real 
you. It’s the same Joe Biden who I’ve 
seen on MSNBC and CNN, who sat 
behind President Barack Obama at 
the State of the Union and cheered 
his accomplishments and his goals. 
You do not put on the political game 
face, switching personas with each 
new interview or address or fund-
raiser. You are always Joe Biden.

Watching this interview, I feel 

like I know you, have known you. 
And not in the “I’d grab a drink 
with that guy” sense with which 
we so often measure our politicians. 
You feel real, human. I see it in the 
way you stare at the ground when 
Colbert brings up your late son, 
Beau. I see it in the enthusiasm with 
which you talk about your son. It 
feels genuine and loving, as a father 
should talk about his son. I see your 
strength, your ability to withstand 
tragedy, to take it in stride and say, 
“but I’m not yet finished with my 
work.” You honor your loved ones’ 
memories by doing what you love, 
by devoting yourself to the service 
of others.

And that is why, Mr. Vice Presi-

dent, you need to run for the Office 
of the President.

When I look out at the field of 

candidates throughout the politi-
cal spectrum I don’t see people. I 
see slogans, sound bites, names. 
These candidates represent ideolo-
gies, with or without the party. But 
you are human, you are real. You 
represent beliefs, beliefs that, when 
combined, create a mantra that says, 
“this is me, this is Joe Biden.” 

And those beliefs are good, hon-

est beliefs. You don’t fight for the 
votes. You fight because it’s the right 
thing to do. You are a practicing Cath-
olic, but you support both abortion 
(with restrictions) and gay marriage 
because you know that your views 
should not restrict the rights of oth-
ers. You fight for middle and working 
class America because you’ve seen 
their plight, you know firsthand what 

others can only read about.

Donald Trump thinks we need 

to “make America great again,” but 
we need to make Americans great 
again. At some point, we Ameri-
cans started to accept that the First 
Amendment was to be brandished 
like a sword to cut down our neigh-
bors, rather than a shield to defend 
against oppression. We became 
complacent. Those in power looked 
out and saw all that they had cre-
ated at the expense of others, at the 
rights ignored, at the lives lost. And 
in biblical fashion they said “and it 
was good.” We have accepted the 
status quo.

But you, Mr. Vice President, push 

onward. You continue to draft and 
push for policy even as the admin-
istration enters its final 16 months. 
You are progressive, but not so 
much as to alienate those who fear 
the word “socialist.” You are pro-
gressive in the sense that you are 
not content with the status quo; 
you recognize that in our modern 
political culture, “conservative” has 
come to mean to look backwards 
rather than forwards. But you know 
better. As John F. Kennedy said 
in 1963, “Change is the law of life. 
And those who look only to the past 
or present are certain to miss the 
future.” We need someone who rep-
resents those aspirations to lead us. 
So that when we look to him, we can 
say that he not only represents our 
beliefs, our values, but the very fab-
ric of being upon which this nation 
was founded.

You’re a career politician but you 

do it not for the status or the power, 
but because you want to help people. 
And all that time in office has given 
you more experience than any other 
candidate in the field. You have 
demonstrated an acute understand-
ing of foreign affairs with more 
experience in this field than Hillary 
Clinton and John Kerry combined; 
perhaps had we listened to you back 
in 2006 and broken down Iraq into 
specific regions for the Shiites, Sun-
nis and Kurds, we would not find 
ourselves in this most splendid 
quagmire we now face.

And on your own personal quag-

mires, those gaffes that the media 

craves, that the public loves to 
devour, I think you slip up because 
you are friendly. You see everybody 
as a good friend and there are few 
boundaries between good friends. 
And even so, those gaffes make you 
authentic — you make a mistake and 
you learn from it, as is human to do.

We need someone authentic to 

enter the fray, difficult as that may 
be for you. We need someone who 
feels no entitlement to the presi-
dency, by name or by wealth or by 
outsider status. We need someone 
who has held more than one term 
in office, someone who hides no 
secrets, someone who can run a 
sustainable campaign for a main-
stream, moderate American people.

We need someone real, someone 

good. You wrote this in your book, 
“Promises to Keep,” “For the world 
to follow, we must do more than 
rattle our sabers and demand alle-
giance to our vision simply because 
we believe we are right. We must 
provide a reason for others to aspire 
to that vision. And that reason must 
come with more than the repetition 
of a bumper-sticker phrase about 
freedom and democracy. It must 
come with more than the restate-
ment of failed policy. It must come 
with the wisdom to admit when we 
are wrong and resolve to change 
course and get it right.” That sounds 
real and good to me.

And if I cannot convince you, 

then at least let me praise you for 
your interview on “The Late Show.” 
You said, “Nobody has a right, in 
my view, to seek that office unless 
they’re willing to give it 110 percent 
of who they are … but I find myself … 
it just sometimes overwhelms you.” 
This country was founded on the 
idea of personal success, on a go-
get-‘em attitude. To admit that you 
are not prepared, that you might not 
have the fire, takes incredible cour-
age and principle. I understand why 
you don’t want to run, but it’s the 
exact reason you should.

Sincerely,
A cynic who has found his faith 

restored.

Jamie Bircoll is an LSA senior 

and a Daily arts editor.

Last Thursday, I sat in Hill Auditorium along 

with thousands of other Greek life members 
listening to the University’s top administrators. 
I sat next to my best friends and role models, 
whom I love and respect, but when my gaze wan-
dered past the faces around me, I was ashamed to 
be a member of the entire Greek life population.

At this point, I know I’m not alone in lack-

ing Greek life pride. Interfraternity Council 
President Alex Krupiak said it at the conclu-
sion of the meeting. Students interviewed by 
the Daily said it afterward. My own soror-
ity’s former head of recruitment said it a few 
days later. And I’m certain if most members 
of Greek life sat down to write their own ideas 
into some concrete form, they would also 
say it.

This lack of pride isn’t just because of this past 

January’s ski trip, or just because the campus 
climate survey on sexual misconduct results told 
us that Greek life members are 2.5 times more 
at risk to be sexually assaulted than non-Greek 
students, or just because of any of the negative 
headlines that were screened in the PowerPoint 
as we all took our seats.

In my experience, Greek life members often 

critique the system (and by system I mean both 
the chapters and the recruitment process) as 
being weird, enormous and bizarre, but it has 
“introduced me to my very best friends so I 
couldn’t imagine not being a part of it.”

I heard those words when rushing during my 

freshman year, I’ve texted those very words to 
high school students who have asked me advice 
on whether to rush or not rush, and I believe 
those words are accurate and fair. In an entirely 
unnatural and fun way, you can efficiently be 
exposed to mass amounts of people. That in itself 
is simultaneously exhilarating and comforting 
for certain people, especially when entering a 
very large undergraduate population.

But these accurate, fair and seemingly harm-

less words are exactly what’s so detrimental to 
our Greek life system. It’s easy, in fact natural, 
to identify and be proud to stand with the indi-
viduals who surround you: your friends and the 
people you look up to. The values those individu-
als stand for are what you stand for, and if you 
and these individuals make up the group — your 
chapter — then you are proud of your chapter.

But when it comes to the larger picture — 32 

Interfraternity Council fraternities, 16 PanHel-
lenic Association sororities, 12 multicultural 
organizations and nine National Pan-Hellenic 
Council organizations — you do not know the val-
ues of members in every single one of these chap-
ters, and therefore it becomes a lot harder to know 
if you’re proud of the community as a whole.

In 1913, French engineer Maximilien Rin-

gelmann coined this fundamental idea in social 
psychology: as a group becomes larger, each 
individual member of the group becomes less 
productive. That Greek life’s size is negatively 
contributing to productivity is an argument I 
wish I could be making. But size isn’t really the 
crux of the issue. Yes, many members of Greek 
Life are strangers to each other, but so are thou-
sands of other University students.

The problem with the Ringelmann effect lies 

in identifying group goals. When it comes to 
joining Greek life, it feels like there’s a lack of a 
concrete, common and unifying end goal. In fact, 
some of the best advice I have received when 
wondering why I’m a part of an organization like 
my sorority is to not take it too seriously.

When I get disheartened that an initiative 

doesn’t launch or not enough girls show up to 
the events I plan, I remind myself that I joined 
this organization for fun. It isn’t a job that will 
help further me along my career path. It isn’t a 
class that will transfer to a letter grade on my 
transcript. I’m choosing to learn from it: con-
versational skills, time-management skills, net-
working skills. It’s a positive experience in my 
life but it isn’t my entire life or a portion of my life 

that I’m dedicated to more than other organiza-
tions or jobs I have on campus. I’m not saying 
this is true for everyone; there are some leaders 
who are working really hard, but for the majority 
of members I believe it is.

As part of the very large institution that is the 

University, your goals are to grow as a leader, 
student, person, what have you. As part of my 
sorority, my goals are to grow as a leader and 
organizer, understand myself through getting to 
know different people and provide a community 
for younger girls. As a part of the community of 
Greek life my goals are to … what?

Answering that third question is a lot harder 

than answering the previous two. This blank is 
the reason for the disrespect, the lack of change 
and the apathy I saw in my fellow Greek mem-
bers on Thursday.

The newest idea that came out of Thursday’s 

meeting was Schlissel’s call to action: to save the 
University’s reputation, because if we do not, it 
will devalue our own reputation as Michigan 
graduates, as well as that of those who came 
before and will come after us. The call to action 
feels like the closest thing Greek life has ever 
come to in terms of a collective goal.

It’s troubling considering the Office of 

Greek life has done a ton of work to answer my 
question. They have outlined strategic goals 
of what Greek life should be accomplishing: 
unity, safety, public service and tradition, to 
name a few, and outlined plans of how these 
goals will be accomplished. These goals and 
detailed plans aren’t really focused on when 
freshmen are deciding to rush or not rush, 
when bid-day pictures are posted or when 
weekly chapter meetings are held.

Schlissel ironically pointed to the fact that 

leadership and change must come from our 
student leaders: the presidents of each of the 
four councils. Something Greek life does pride 
itself on is being a student-governed organiza-
tion, and it’s pretty impressive when you think 
about it. Hundreds of young adults dedicate 
hundreds of hours a week to systematically 
categorizing themselves (even using complex 
coding systems to do it) into social groups, cre-
ating rules to be followed and a police force to 
enforce these rules.

But this leadership and organization that 

students are motivated to participate in is 
just a sliver of pride that needs to be utilized 
more. Though I know council presidents have 
been working hard to generate change, it does 
feel as if the Office of Greek life has done the 
planning for us and that administrators are 
overseeing us. That combination inspires no 
member of Greek life.

I believe the common reasons for joining 

Greek life — please hear me when I say are not 
at all the wrong reasons — are to meet new peo-
ple, attend events that get you out of your dorm 
room freshman year and give back to the com-
munity through service and philathropy. But 
very rarely do these initial reasons evolve into 
the highly important goals of bright, driven 
University of Michigan students. Very rarely 
do students take on sorority or fraternity lead-
ership positions with the same sincerity that 
they take their summer internships or their 
 

job recruiting.

The people sitting in Hill Auditorium Thurs-

day evening are not apathetic people, but they do 
not prioritize their chapter in a professional way. 
Neither do I. I care about it in a way where I take 
the good relationships it has given to me, but I 
look at it as a social institution, just one part of 
me, not my entire life and learning environment. 
I know I can escape it if I don’t want to tailgate 
one Saturday morning, so it doesn’t force me to 
look it in the eye and work for policies that pro-
mote safer tailgating. 

That’s the heartbreaking thing about Kru-

piak’s final statement, because though his 
chapter means the world to him, it just doesn’t 

Dear Joe, please run

Apathy toward accountability

mean enough for so many members. 
University students are doing a lot 
and, frankly, their social organiza-
tion isn’t going to keep them up late 
at night thinking of ways to innovate 
(though it might keep them up for 

other reasons). It isn’t a student orga-
nization or an internship or a class 
that they are passionate about. It isn’t 
creating enough collective good for 
the masses to take enough pride in it 
to change it.

Petite Noir is unique 
but still frustrating

ALBUM REVIEW

“Noirwave” artist 

restructures 

electronic music in 

debut

By DANIEL SAFFRON

Daily Arts Writer

Yannick Ilunga, under the 

stagename 
Petite 
Noir, 

releases 
his 

first full-length 
album Le Vie 
Est Belle // Life 
Is 
Beautiful 

through 
Domino 
Records. Ilunga 
labels the music 
“Noirwave,” 
a 
subgenre 

derivative 
of 

the New Wave 
movement 
of 
the 
’80s. 
The 
album 

offers 
Ilunga’s 
interesting 

interpretation and restructuring 
of electronic music and pushes 
the ears of its listeners to accept 
rhythmic and harmonic patterns 
seldom explored by the larger 
genre’s “popular” counterparts.

The first track of the album, 

“Intro 
Noirwave,” 
does 
as 

it 
promises. 
It 
softly 
and 

surreptitiously introduces the 
album’s unique approaches and 
emphases. While easily glossed 
over as a soft start to the later, 
replay-friendlier tracks, there’s 
a lot more going on than one 
might think. “Intro Noirwave” 
is structured on two different 
sections, 
the 
differentiating 

characteristic of which being the 
two different polyrhythmic and 
strongly syncopated structures 
on which the relatively static 
harmonic padding is buttressed. 
From here things get slightly 
more 
involved. 
The 
song’s 

principal phrase length is 16 
bars, and it is from these 16 bar 
cycles that the music derives 
all of its overarching pulses and 

transitions. The sections, call 
them A and B respectively, are 
introduced as 16-bar sections. 
Each 
section 
then 
further 

reworks the 16 bars. The A 
section is based on a repeating 
two-bar rhythmic phrase; the 
B section is based on a four-bar 
phrase, broken into repeating 
two-bar phrases. The harmonic 
padding in the B section changes 
in 8 bar phrases, while in the A 
section the harmonic rhythm is 
a little more obscured. It is also 
broken into eight-bar phrases, 
however there is motion in the 
second pulse of the first phrase 
then again on the downbeat of 
the second phrase.

This involved interpretation 

illustrates that hiding within 
the 
apparent 
simplicity 
of 

Petite Noir’s music is a nuanced 
complexity, a look at which 
helps to understand where the 
music is coming from — a place 
where rhythm and structure 
are monarchical over harmony 
and melody. These rhythmic 
processes are integral to Petite 
Noir’s sound and it’s their 
emphasis that allows Petite 
Noir to free himself from the 
strictures of more mainstream 
music — the trend for which has 
been an overwhelming reliance 
on harmony and melody for 
structure — only using rhythm 
for groove and feel.

With one notable exception 

— “Seventeen (Stay)” — the 
album struggles with its song’s 
endings, which are too similar 
between 
tracks 
and 
don’t 

feel very complimentary to 
each track’s groove; the songs 
feel like they end because 
they need to end, leaving an 
organic 
ending 
longed 
for. 

“Seventeen (Stay),” however, 
grows into itself rather nicely. 
It is always appreciated when 
an artist attempts a long-
form composition. The song 
showcases 
Ilunga’s 
ability 

to work with and maintain a 
dynamic energy throughout a 
seven-minute 
track. 
Proving 

with this track the ability to 

allow a song to take its course, it 
is a shame that the other songs 
on the album are cut short. 
The album is a very successful 
miscegenation 
of 
electronic 

sounds, acoustic instruments 
and 
Ilunga’s 
distinct 
voice, 

whose peaty, girthsome timbre 
is smoky-sweet in the low 
registers and horn-like at the top 
of its range. “Best” and “Colour” 
are upbeat and danceable, while 
the title track and “Chess” are 
slower, sultry and seductive. “Le 
Vie Est Belle // Life Is Beautiful 
(feat. Baloji)” boasts one of 
the album’s highlights, when 
the hearty inertial drive of the 
track is minced and tossed up 
by a French verse from Baloji, 
a 
Congolese, 
Belgium-based 

rapper.

Le Vie Est Belle // Life is 

Beautiful also finds issues with 
its song placement. There is no 
real sense of narrative structure 
emerging from the track listing. 
There is nothing wrong or bad 
about any track placement, but 
I struggle to locate any intra-
album dialectic between songs. 
Furthermore, the sandwiching 
of 
the 
penultimate 
song 

between “Chess” and “Down,” 
tracks released months prior to 
the album release, don’t serve 
the album well. Having listened 
to these two tracks many times 
outside of the context of this 
particular album – in the case 
of “Chess” within the context 
of a different album, The King 
of Anxiety EP – I was pulled out 
of the album’s vibe right at its 
end, an album’s most sensitive 
moment.

The tracks released on Le Vie 

Est Belle are good, and some have 
a secure spot on my playlists 
for the foreseeable future. Its 
utilization of rhythmic phrasing 
and reinterpretation of the 
electronic sound make it good, 
but its many shortcomings put 
it shy of being a great album. I 
do, however, suspect a positive 
trajectory for Petite Noir and 
look forward to his next full 
length release.

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Black Sheep’ beats 
its own damn drum

By CLAIRE WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

I’m three shots down when I 

hear it. 

“Ohhhhhhhhhh.”
Silence.
“Ohhhhhhhhhh.”
Not 
choir 
Ohs. 
Nothing 

delicate or dainty. These Ohs 
rumble, thick and thunderous, 
the kind you’d hear while 
engaging in some zealous tribal 
ritual around a bonfire.

Drums pound. Tambourines 

tremble. 
Piano 
cascades 

beneath a robust, arpeggiated 
voice line that sucks you under 
like a waterfall.

“Everybody’s doing it, so why 

the hell should I?”

Vocals cut the chaos. It’s 

Gin Wigmore singing “Black 
Sheep” from her 2013 album 
Gravel and Wine. Her words 
ring with raspy soul, and you 
wonder if she downed a shot 
of Jack Daniels before hitting 
the studio. It’s the kind of voice 
that wears a leather jacket, and 
those shiny black boots with 
the spurs on the side. Confident 
and contagious. Potent and 

powerful.

“I wasn’t born a beauty queen, 

but I’m OK with that,” she sings. 
“Radio won’t mind if I sing a 
little flat.”

The lyrics are honest and 

open, and I’m taken by surprise. 
I hear healthy standards for 
body image; I hear a realistic 
response to flaws. It’s self-
acceptance — and it’s refreshing. 

“I’m a black sheep,” Wigmore 

announces. “I’m a black sheep.”

Black Sheep. 
The phrase catches me off 

guard. The only “black sheep” I 
knew was “Baa Baa” — the one 
my grandmother used to ask for 
wool, back in my nursery-rhyme 
years. Yes Sir, Yes Sir, Three Bags 
Full.

But the phrase has more 

definitions. 
Enter: 
Urban 

Dictionary 
— 
Black 
Sheep: 

“Someone who doesn’t follow 
mainstream 
ways. 
Someone 

who doesn’t care what is in or 
out.” 

And over a soul-quaking, 

earth-shaking 
ensemble 
of 

drums and piano, Gin Wigmore 
screams this. Her words tingle 
with ballsy confidence — an 

irresistible invincibility that 
drags me in. She says, I am who 
I am. I beat my own drum. Bite 
me. 

So I’m sitting here, three 

shots down, my back pressed 
against the bottom half of a red 
sofa stained with God-knows-
what on the apartment floor 
of God-knows-who. And I’m 
hooked — completely hooked. 
Not just because the drums 
pound, and the piano thunders. 
Not just because the vocals soar.

I’m 
hooked 
because 
Gin 

Wigmore is right. 

“Black Sheep” is a song about 

self-acceptance. 
It’s 
a 
song 

about loving yourself for who 
you are, what you are, and what 
you stand for. It’s about going to 
medical school, because that’s 
your passion. It’s about dying 
your hair orange, because that’s 
your color. It’s about moving 
to the city, because that’s your 
dream. Or rocking medical 
school, dying your hair orange, 
and then hitting the Big Apple 
because that’s who you are, and 
hey — why not?

We all have our own drums. 

Hell, let’s pound them.

If you don’t know who The 

Libertines are, don’t feel bad. 
It’s not every day you find a 
’90s-bred 
college student 
fluent 
in 
the 

early 
2000s 

Brit-garage-
rock 
revival. 

While we were 
watching “Dora 
the 
Explorer,” 

Libertines 
frontman Pete 
Doherty 
was 

injecting illegal 
substances, 
courting Kate Moss and singing 
about the “Boys in the Band.” 
But hey, here we are — and here 
The Libertines are with a brand 
new release, just 11 years after 
their last album. No big deal.

A 
more 
proper 
biopic: 

Four 
strapping 
chaps 
from 

the mean streets of London 
banded together around 1997, 
at the prompting of Doherty 
and co-founder/guitarist Carl 
Barât, to form the group some 
of us — particularly Brits — now 
know and love. They put out 
two incredible albums in 2002 
and 2004 (Up the Bracket and 
The 
Libertines, 
respectively), 

but underwent an ugly breakup 
in 2004 that stemmed from 
Doherty’s 
profound 
romance 

with crack, cocaine and heroin. 
Ahem. Forgive me, Your Majesty. 

So what’s the point, you 

ask? Why are we bothering 
with these sloppy, short-lived 
hooligans who obviously can’t 
seem to get their shit together? 
Well, to start, The Libertines’s 
music 
is 
nothing 
short 
of 

consistently 
brilliant 
(see: 

“Can’t Stand Me Now,” “Time 
for Heroes” and “The Good Old 

Days”). And though they have 
lost a smidgen of their edge now, 
it seems, Anthems for Doomed 
Youth is a valiant comeback for 
these resilient Redcoats.

The aptly titled “Barbarians” 

begins 
the 
punk-throwback 

journey, and here The Libertines 
rest in familiar territory. Catchy 
tempo changes, rebellious lyrics, 
clanging guitars — it’s all good 
stuff, even if Doherty sounds the 
tiniest bit soggier than before 
(sobriety’s a bitch). “Belly of the 
Beast” is similar in its nostalgic 
allure, and “Glasgow Coma Scale 
Blues” adds some chutzpah to 
the Libertinian formula with its 
nifty stop-start riffs and great 
rock feel.

Whatever it means, “Fury 

of the Chonburi” works just 
as well. It brings the group’s 
coolest defining characteristic 
back to the forefront: messy 
choruses that are the sonic 
equivalent of a train-wreck bar 
fight too fascinating to look away 
from. “Gunga Din” is also stellar 
— 
a 
ska-esque, 
Californian 

ditty with chords that aim to 
please. Easy, breezy, beautiful. 
Libertines.

The band starts to fall off 

the 
bracket, 
though, 
with 

the slow songs. Yes, balance 
and diversity is the key to 
any 
proportional, 
successful 

compilation, but Anthems for 
Doomed 
Youth 
overestimates 

the temporary charm of a yawn. 
“You’re My Waterloo” is lovely 
but underwhelming, and then 
“Iceman” starts, along with the 
listener’s desire to doze off. By 
the time “The Milkman’s Horse” 
comes 
around, 
the 
stretchy 

argot of Doherty’s lyrics and 
sleepy background drums have 
the listener itching to abuse 
the fast-forward button. Here’s 
the problem: The Libertines 
have proven they can do truly 

inventive slow stuff (“Music 
When The Lights Go Out”) in 
the past. As a result, these new, 
yet trite tracks sound studio-
ized and lackluster at best. If 
anything, the closing “Dead for 
Love” is effective because of its 
deep lyrical content detailing 
the passing of one of Doherty’s 
druggie friends. “Fame and 
Fortune” completely misses the 
mark, as it mostly sounds like 
a creepy musical number the 
Artful Dodger would sing to 
little punk rockers in training.

The album hits the nail on the 

head, though, at precisely two 
locations. “Heart of the Matter” 
is a gritty triumph, showcasing 
The Libertines in their most 
perfect, traditional form. No 
resting, no slowing down, just 
pure, 
unadulterated 
garage. 

And what’s that I hear? Ever-so-
slight synths in the background? 
Score one for Team Doherty.

“Anthem for Doomed Youth,” 

the titular track, is perhaps the 
biggest accomplishment. “Was 
it Cromwell or Orwell who 
first led you to the stairwell, 
which leads only forever to 
kingdom come? Rushed along 
by guiding hands, whispers of 
the promised land

. They wished you luck 

and 
handed 
you 
a 
gun,” 

Doherty philosophizes against 
desperate acoustic guitars. This 
is where “lackluster” can work 
in favor of the band — when 
the theme of the tune is that 
of the simultaneous beauty 
and ennui of youth. The music 
then conveys the longing, the 
aimlessness 
of 
feeling 
the 

world at your fingertips. The 
Libertines know what it’s like 
to muck up that potential. But 
maybe there’s something to 
mucking it up and getting it 
right — bloody right — in the 
end.

The media’s trouble 

with girlfriends

INT. CROWDED NEW YORK 

CITY SUBWAY – MORNING
I

t’s an unbearably hot, humid 
July 
day. One 

sweaty, 
solitairy 
20-year-old 
girl stands 
against 
the center 
pole. Her 
appearance 
is marked 
by heels she 
obviously is 
not handling well, a University of 
Michigan umbrella that negates 
any pretense of style and white 
headphones resting innocently in 
her ears. She laughs uncontrol-
lably.

* * *

Obviously, that perspiring loser 

was me. I spent my summer riding 
New York subways, and to pass 
the time I became enamored with 
podcasts. (Yes, I’m a Millennial, 
come at me.) I’ll admit, I had never 
really understood the podcast 
game, as a lifelong reader myself. 
But my much more cultured friend 
gave me a list of ones she thought 
I would like, and my summer 
became marked with having 
strangers’ voices constantly in 
my ear.

Now back at school, one of 

those podcasts is still a weekly 
touchpoint for me — “Call Your 
Girlfriend,” a podcast primar-
ily about two long distance best 
friends catching up every week. 
Ann Friedman and Aminatou 
Sow — both warm, accomplished 
and well-read women in their late 
20s — spend an hour each week 
talking about a range of topics, all 
squarely within my wheelhouse: 
Feminism, politics, Beyoncé, 
menstrual cramps and “The Good 
Wife.”

Ann and Aminatou are the 

long-distance besties that I hope 
my close female friends and I to 
be someday. But they also are one 
of the few external expressions of 
close female friendship I’ve felt 
connected to in a long time. Bar-
ring 2005’s seminal “Sisterhood 
of the Traveling Pants” film and 

Monica and Rachel’s relationship 
on “Friends,” pop culture has a 
dearth of accurately represented 
girl best friends. Other than my 
close family members and few 
friends of the male inclination, I 
can say pretty much exclusively 
that the most important people 
in my life have been my female 
friends, and I want to see more of 
that in the media I so reverently 
consume.

There are shows and movies 

that stab at it: “Gilmore Girls,” one 
of the most feminist shows of all 
time, is a celebratory homage to 
strong and intelligent women. And 
yes, Lorelai and Rory each have a 
best friend: positive, supportive, 
slightly dependent figures in both 
their lives. But on a show that is 
so female-focused it barely passes 
the reverse Bechdel test, there 
are few Gilmore female relation-
ships beyond these singular best 
friends during the seven-season 
course of the show. In contrast, 
“Girls” doesn’t lack a variety of 
friendships, but the show spends 
more time engaging with the self-
ish, destructive side of friendship, 
never building up the warmth and 
connection that can and should be 
present.

On the other hand, “Friday 

Night Lights” never pretended to 
be an expert on female friendship. 
It was a show about a small-town 
football coach and his luminous 
wife. But since its debut in 2006, 
“FNL” has been rightfully her-
alded as a show that thrives in its 
relationships — the spectrum of 
intimacy is palpable between all 
the different types of characters 
that exist in Dillon, Texas. But 
while we see Coach and his play-
ers connect, young teens fall in 
love, fathers and sons crumble and 
one marriage stay blessedly strong 
throughout, “FNL” never gives us 
the relationship that I find most 
relatable: The close female friend-
ship.

Why do some of the best writ-

ers of our time struggle with this 
relationship? Is it that writing is 
still a man’s game in Hollywood? 
Or that executives can’t imagine 
a female relationship that isn’t 
sexualized in some form? I really 

don’t know. But I can count on 
one hand the number of friend-
ships I have seen in pop culture 
that reflect my own, and I don’t 
like that.

Enter: USA’s “Playing House.” 

I’ll admit, I’m way behind the 
times with this show, now deep 
into it’s second season. “House,” 
a half-hour sitcom written by and 
starring real-life best friends Len-
non Parnam and Jessica St. Clair, 
follows two adult women at cross-
roads in their lives. Maggie is eight 
months pregnant when she discov-
ers her husband is cheating on her, 
and Emma quits her high-powered 
job to come home and help her 
raise the baby.

It’s the perfect domestic part-

nership my best friends and I 
dream of having, if sexual prefer-
ence wasn’t an issue. But really, this 
show gets it. Maggie and Emma 
are comfortable with one another 
in ways only female friends can be. 
They fight, but it’s never overblown 
or disastrous. They understand 
each other’s strengths and weak-
nesses deeply, and feed into one 
another’s insecurities only when 
feeling insecure themselves. They 
have fun together. They laugh 
often. They talk about boys and sex 
and careers with equal measure. 
As a show, “Playing House” isn’t 
perfect — the humor is risk-free 
and the plot points are never 
particularly strong. But like “Call 
Your Girlfriend,” it’s a comfort-
ing and rarely seen expression of 
female friendship. I see myself and 
my friends in Maggie and Emma, 
and I’m grateful that their rela-
tionship is never belittled.

I know I am lucky in the female 

friendships I have had, to hold 
such a high standard within pop 
culture. But in a world infatuated 
with bromances, I’d love a little 
more representation. As I sit here 
on my porch, drinking a beer with 
my best friends — all smart and 
kind and interesting and funny — 
I can’t help but think: Why hasn’t 
anyone made a show about us? 
Hollywood, please get to work.

ALBUM REVIEW

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Over the 42-minute finale of E!’s 

docu-series, “I Am Cait,” the first 
chapter of a long, groundbreaking 
journey came to a close. Cait 
and Kris Jenner 
reunited. Cait met 
the pastor who 
would 
officiate 

her name-change 
ceremony. 
And, 

finally, 
Bruce 

Jenner 
officially 

became 
Caitlyn 

Jenner — her authentic self — 
and struck the chord of a new 
beginning.

Caitlyn Jenner’s marriage to 

Kris seemed as if it was only a 
dream at this point, but for the 
Kardashian/Jenner clan, it was 
the glue that held their antics 
together. Like most imminent 
sit-down discussions, this began 
tense: Curt hellos, “Where should 
we sit?” and “OK, let’s get to it.” 
But in contrary to E! culture, 
there wasn’t a cat fight; there 
were minimal tears and a sensible 
Kris Kardashian. Over the course 
of “I Am Cait” ’s first season, the 
Kardashian side had often felt 
like guest stars as opposed to 
Caitlyn’s new group of girlfriends, 
which is fine — the show wasn’t 
about the Kardashians, it was 

about Caitlyn’s journey into the 
transgender community — but 
it’s hard to ignore Kris’s feelings 
of being left behind. Conversely, 
it’s hard to ignore Caitlyn’s hurt 
feelings over how the marriage 
ended and Kris’s lack of support. 
Nonetheless, the women and 
audience settled on the notion 
that from now on it will be better. 
*Scene closes with a selfie.*

Ultimately, this episode and the 

entire season led into Caitlyn’s 
official transition into herself. 
She hosted a gorgeous ceremony 
in her newly-redecorated Malibu 
home complete with her girl 
squad, Boy George and a gay 
men’s choir. Shandi read different 
meanings of the name “Caitlyn” 
inviting smiles; Jennifer read a 
touching E.E. Cummings poem; 
and finally, Candis sang “Amazing 
Grace.” 
Everyone 
dressed 
 

flawlessly in white. ’Twas an 
occasion that would give any 
Kardashian wedding a run for its 
money. Next, Cait and her friends 
discussed the role of religion in 
the transgender community over 
lunch. The conversation covered 
many bases: A man shouldn’t 
dress like a woman. You shouldn’t 
touch a pig. Yes, those are both 
biblical verses discussed, and yes 
they do not hold much weight in 
today’s society. No, that doesn’t 
make anyone godless. It’s a 

poignant 
scene 
that 
touches 

on the presence of spirituality 
in the trans community while 
concurrently acknowledging the 
fact that many are pushed away 
from religion as they move toward 
their true selves.

Ultimately, Caitlyn Jenner bid 

her first-season audience farewell 
make-up-less from her bedroom 
webcam: “We’ve got a long way to 
go, but at least we’ve got a really 
really good beginning. And that 
makes my heart feel good.”

Before “I Am Cait” aired, 

E! got a lot of side eye for the 
term “docu-series.” And as the 
series 
premiered, 
progressed 

and finished, the show itself has 
been judged based on the merits 
of reality television as opposed 
to the documentary it aimed to 
be. “I Am Cait” can pride itself 
on showing the best in its cast 
as opposed to capitalizing on 
the less-than-desirable parts of 
human nature.

“Can my hat BE any bigger?”

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

I’m a hard fightin’ soldier, and 

I’m on the battlefield

I’ll keep bringing soul to Jesus 

by the service 
– the service. 
That I bring.

The service 

... is hard.

So sings an 

old Bible song; 
the 
voice 
of 

some essential 
elder. 
Enter 

Gary Clark, Jr. 
on the electric 
guitar, 
soon 

to be followed 
by a gospel choir for the opening 
track, “The Healing,” of Clark’s 
second studio release, The Story 
of Sonny Boy Slim. This track, like 
most of the album, is spiritual, 
it’s personal and it’s powerful 
— it’s blues, it’s rock and, at 
times, it’s funk. Clark’s sound is 
warm and empowering, charged 
with a relaxing undercurrent of 
momentum.

His voice evokes John Legend 

and his verging-on-psychedelic 
guitar solos evoke remembrances 
of Jimi Hendrix. These evocations 
make up the skeleton of Clark’s 
full-bodied 
musical 
aesthetic, 

nuanced 
and 
completely 

unique. And it’s this muscular, 
multifaceted sound that over the 
years has earned him collabs with 
artists like Foo Fighters, Alicia 
Keys and Sheryl Crow.

The longest track on The Story 

of Sonny Boy Slim, “Down to 
Ride” has a promising title, but 
reaches only 7:52 in length, and 
the time that would have been 
occupied with an awesomely 
intense guitar solo instead was 
met with a mellow but repetitive 

synth beat and much less guitar; 
it comes off as stingy, almost 
lazy in comparison to Blak and 
Blu’s “Third Stone from the Sun/
If You Love Me Like You Say,” 
which opens with that burning 
solo we were aching for, followed 
by heavy drums fortified with 
integrity. What’s worse is that 
“Down to Ride” is the last song 
on Sonny Boy Slim; Clark bids his 
audience farewell with a circling 
electronic beat (really?). Clark’s 
first studio album, Blak and Blu, 
back in 2012, was much grittier 
than Sonny Boy Slim, with songs 
over nine minutes long as he 
seamlessly filled the timespace 
with those incredible Hendrixian 
solos.

I’m making it sound like I hate 

the album, but The Story of Sonny 
Boy Slim is strong in many ways: 
most notably, it has more variety 
than Blak and Blu. “Church” is 
an easy acoustic ballad that uses 
a 
harmonica 
and 
gospel-like 

background vocals. Songs like 
“Hold On” and “BYOB” use jaunty 
electric guitar, horns and bass in 

ways that give this album much 
more of a funk undertone than we 
have seen Clark use in the past; 
instead of focusing on long and 
intense guitar solos (which some 
fans may miss), this album covers 
more ground. And he manages to 
do this without sounding forced, 
which is a testament to Clark’s 
versatility and musical fluency. 
This kind of variety also gives the 
album potential to garner more 
widespread appeal than Blak and 
Blu, and luckily Clark has enough 
talent to pull off a slightly more 
popularized release.

Less grit may make him easier 

to listen to for people who found 
his first album a little too intense, 
but the Austin native is best when 
he’s at his most soulful, grinding 
on the guitar and chiming in 
with his honey-toned voice only 
every now and then. Sonny Boy 
Slim will make you feel cool, 
calm, collected and ready to take 
anything as it comes, because 
as he sings to you like velvet, 
“Everywhere you go, just know 
that you’re a star.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Fifth-year senior punter Blake O’Neill grew up playing Australian-rules football and uses the same technique for Michigan.

Morris redshirt 
a ‘consideration’

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

After 
a 
hotly 
contested 

quarterback 
battle 
between 

junior Shane Morris and fifth-
year 
senior 

Jake 
Rudock 

ended 
with 

Rudock as the victor, it was 
assumed those two would take 
all the snaps under center for 
Michigan unless the season took 
a severe turn for the worse.

So when sophomore Wilton 

Speight trotted out on the field 
instead of Morris to close out 
a game where everything had 
gone right for the Wolverines, 
confusion and speculation filled 
Michigan Stadium.

Following 
the 
35-7 
win, 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
cited respect for the veteran 
Morris as the reason for using 
Speight in meaningless minutes. 
But when addressing the media 
Monday, the coach addressed the 
rumors that the decision was to 
keep Morris eligible for a redshirt.

“That’s a possibility. That’s a 

consideration,” Harbaugh said. 
“You don’t know how it’s going to 
play out. You don’t have a crystal 
ball. We’re all seeing this exactly 
the way it is taking place.”

Though Morris has recorded 

just two starts in his career, he 
has never earned a redshirt. 
He was still listed as the No. 2 
quarterback in the Wolverines’ 
updated depth chart Monday, but 
has yet to see the field this season, 
keeping him in line, for now, for 
the added year of eligibility.

“We’re 
in 
control 
of 
it,” 

Harbaugh said. “He is the No. 2 
quarterback, but not the No. 2 
guy going in to take two kneel-

downs at the end of the game.”

BUMPS 
AND 
BRUISES: 

With two games under Michigan’s 
belt, 
the 
team 
has 
avoided 

devastating injuries so far. More 
fortunately for the Wolverines, 
senior 
running 
back 
Drake 

Johnson and sophomore receiver 
Freddy Canteen — both of whom 
were expected to contribute to 
the offense this fall — appear to be 
rounding into form.

Both 
played 
sparingly 

Saturday, but got their feet wet in 
game action.

“I had a feeling that, when you 

haven’t played in a while because 
of an injury, your nervous system 
can put your body in a position 
that it can’t recover from if you’re 
not 
careful,” 

Harbaugh said. 
“It’s 
almost 

like an iron fist. 
Your 
nervous 

system 
does 

that 
to 
your 

body. 
You 

want 
to 
get 

acclimated 
to the feelings and emotions of 
playing a game. … I think we’ll 
be better for that this week and 
next.”

On the other side of the coin, 

junior cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
has yet to be cleared to play 
against UNLV. Though still listed 
as the starting cornerback on the 
latest depth chart, Harbaugh is 
letting his team’s medical staff 
make the call on a timetable for 
Lewis’ return.

“I’ve 
never 
really 
gotten 

into the business of predicting, 
when it comes to concussions,” 
Harbaugh said. “I’m not into 
predicting. It’s not my area.”

Senior fullback Joe Kerridge, 

junior 
running 
back 
Wyatt 

Shallman, junior linebacker Mike 
McCray, sophomore tight end 
Chase Winovich and freshman 
tight end Tyrone Wheatley Jr. are 
also questionable for the week 
ahead with unspecified injuries.

TECHNIQUE THE KEY FOR 

OFFENSIVE LINE: It’s been 
well documented that Michigan’s 
offensive line showed night-and-
day improvement in Week Two 
compared to Week One. That was 
especially true in the run game, 
where yards per carry increased 
from 2.6 against Utah to 4.7.

Though it seemed to happen 

overnight, the Wolverines insist 
it wasn’t that easy.

“(Offensive line coach Tim 

Drevno) really 
stressed 
the 

practice 
and 

technique and 
fundamentals 
and practicing 
the way you’re 
going to play 
in the game 
on 
Saturday,” 

Harbaugh said. “So it wasn’t 
simple. It was a lot of hard work 
during the week. We’re striving 
for that again this week.”

Despite 
the 
growth, 
the 

improvement comes with the fact 
that Oregon State has a below-
average defensive front, while 
Utah had one of the nation’s best 
last season. Regardless of the 
opponent, the unit is trying to 
implement a simpler approach.

“We have to do it every play,” 

Magnuson said. “It gets hard 
focusing on a big goal, which is 
to become an offensive line, so 
play in and play out was out focus 
in practice, and it paid off in the 
game.”

Michigan ties for 11th 
at Gopher Invitational

Five golfers earn 

spot in lineup 

after coach holds 
qualifying matches

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

There are eight golfers on the 

Michigan men’s golf team, but 
just five spots were available 
for the Gopher Invitational. So 
before traveling to Minnesota, 
Michigan coach Chris Whitten 
held 
qualifying 
matches 
to 

determine who would compete 
in the weekend tournament.

The 

Gopher 
Invitational 
was the first 
event 
of 

the 
season 

for 
the 

Wolverines, 
and 
for 

those 
who 

competed, it 
was the first chance to maintain 
their spot in the lineup. In a 
sport where an outcome can be 
uncertain and frustrating, the 
top five golfers had to be precise 
and consistent.

Sophomore 
Kyle 
Mueller, 

freshman 
Nick 
Carlson, 

junior Tom Swanson, senior 
Chris O’Neill and junior Reed 
Hrynewich made the cut from 
the qualifiers for their right 
to play three rounds at the 
Windsong Farm Golf Club. 
Their next round of competition 
was against 15 other teams, 
which 
included 
No. 
14 

Oklahoma and No. 21 Baylor and 
a field of 76 other golfers in a 
crowded invitational, which ran 
from Sunday through Monday 
afternoon.

The five combined for a score 

of 895, good for an 11th-place tie 
in the tournament.

Michigan ended the first 

two rounds on Sunday near the 
bottom of the team standings. 
With a combined score of 604, 
the Wolverines finished 13th 
out of 16 teams. Weather and 
darkness delayed and postponed 
play 
for 
parts 
of 
Sunday, 

hindering golfers from posting 
their best scores. The standing 
was no disappointment, though, 
as Michigan was within five 
strokes of five teams ahead of 
it. Swanson and O’Neill both 
tied for 16th place individually, 
poised to lead the Wolverines out 
of the bottom of the standings 
toward a higher finish.

“(After the first round), we 

got back to playing normal 
golf,” Whitten said. “The first 
round 
was 

the 
atypical 

round. I don’t 
know if there’s 
really a good 
explanation 
other 
than 

being in the 
wrong 
spot, 

and the wind 
blowing really 
hard. But it 
played the same for everybody.”

Four of the five golfers made 

improvements from their first 
rounds to their second time 
on the course. Hyrnewich had 
the highest score, but also the 
biggest 
difference 
in 
score 

between the first two rounds, 
shooting eight strokes better 
in his later round on Sunday. 
Carlson, making his collegiate 
debut, also made significant 
headway, shooting a 75 after 
posting an 81 in his first round 
as a Michigan golfer. At the end 
of the first round, he racked up 
nine strokes on the 18th hole, 
but made a quick turnaround to 
make his weekend memorable.

“He ran into some really bad 

luck and compounded that with 
a bad shot or two (on the 18th 
hole),” Whitten said. “But he got 
right back to playing steady golf 
for us for the rest of the way. … 

He started his college career on 
one of the tougher courses we’ll 
play, and he handled it great.”

The 
Wolverines 
entered 

Monday’s 
final 
round 
with 

momentum and a familiarity of 
the course. Those two factors 
contributed to their success, 
as Michigan vied to make its 
way up the standings. The 
Wolverines only climbed one 
spot, finishing 12th, held back 
by a first round that prevented 
them from placing in the top 
10. Michigan shot significantly 
better in the last two rounds, 
but the effort wasn’t enough to 
overshadow the first round.

“After being behind by so 

much after the first round,” 

Whitten said, 
“the 
guys 

had 
to 
dig 

deep a little 
bit, 
toughen 

up and play 
better 
golf 

after that.”

Swanson 

shot 
a 

stroke 
lower 

compared 

to his last outing on Sunday, 
earning an even-par 71. Swanson 
— the only Wolverine to post 
a score that wasn’t over par 
— finished a team and career-
high tie for sixth place. Mueller 
and Carlson both shot three 
strokes better, each posting 72 
on the scorecard. Hrynewich 
remained steady with a 77, and 
O’Neill dropped two strokes to 
finish the weekend with a 76.

Without an abnormal first 

round, Michigan would have 
had a more impressive outing. 
But the challenge was another 
sort of qualifying round after 
the one the Wolverines had 
before the tournament. The 
lineup may change as the 
season matures, but for those 
who competed at the Gopher 
Invitational, 
the 
experience 

already gives them a leg up on 
the rest.

NOTEBOOK

FOOTBALL

“You don’t know 
how it’s going to 

play out.”

Michigan punter O’Neill 
an Australian Zoolander

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Before Michigan punter Blake 

O’Neill ever considered playing 
American football, he was a 
fashion model in Melbourne, 
Australia.

“I 
was 
a 
little 
budding 

Zoolander,” O’Neill said Monday.

His 
modeling 
in 
fashion 

magazines and other publications 
provided a way to make some 
extra money while he completed 
his undergraduate degree in his 
native country.

At 
no 
point 
during 
his 

modeling career did O’Neill ever 
expect that he’d one day punt for 
the Michigan football team.

As 
many 
football 
careers 

begin, 
O’Neill 
first 
became 

familiar with the sport when he 
was a little kid, playing with his 
dad. But O’Neill and his father 
played Australian rules football.

O’Neill’s father had played the 

sport locally, so naturally, O’Neill 
did too. Describing Australian 
rules football in simple terms that 
an American would understand, 
with its many kicks and near-
constant action, is difficult even 
for a seasoned player.

“If you were to combine rugby 

and soccer, and then you pass 
with your feet, maybe that’s 
getting close,” O’Neill said.

In Australian rules football, 

O’Neill’s role was different from 
what it is in American football. 
Because the ball is moved with 

kicks and not through passing, 
O’Neill played a position called 
halfback, 
which 
entailed 

attempting to spread the defense 
and creating misdirection to give 
his teammates an advantage.

His 
decision 
to 
pursue 

American football came after 
he finished his undergraduate 
degree and decided it would be a 
good way to see the U.S. and add 
on to his education. He decided 
to 
attend 

ProKick 
Australia, 
an 
academy 

that 
helps 

Australian 
football 
players 
transform 
into 
American 
football 
punters 
in 

the hopes of earning college 
scholarships. O’Neill estimated 
that it normally takes about six 
months to make the transition for 
a punter from Australian rules 
football to American football.

O’Neill 
believes 
the 

Australian style of punting has 
its advantages. He kicks the ball 
at an angle, making adjustments 
depending on the situation, as 
opposed to the typical American 
punter who dropkicks the ball in 
a repetitive motion every single 
kick.

“Traditional punting, as great 

as it is, it really is one thing, 

and it’s high and long and then 
you have to cover down there,” 
O’Neill said. “Where if you can 
change the launch point, you 
can change the block point, you 
can change where your guys are 
covering, it really makes it tough 
to scheme for another team.”

The 
advantages

Aide job draws 408 applicants

Head coach’s 

communications 
director becomes 
popular position

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

For most Michigan fans, 

opportunities 
to 
see 
Jim 

Harbaugh in person had been 
fleeting before his first game 
coaching in Michigan Stadium 
on 
Saturday. 
Throughout 

the eight months before his 
coaching debut, Harbaugh spent 
much of his time hunkered 
down in Schembechler Hall 
preparing for the upcoming 
season or traveling the country 
and the world.

So 
when 
the 
University 

posted a job opening on June 
16 to be the director of internal 
communications and operations 
for the head football coach, 
people jumped at the chance to 
apply and work with Harbaugh. 
According to a Freedom of 
Information Act request filed by 
the Daily, 408 people applied for 
the position in the week the job 
was posted.

The selected applicant was 

Zach 
Eisendrath, 
who 
had 

previously been an assistant 
director of public and media 
relations 
in 
the 
Athletic 

Department, working with the 
football and men’s tennis teams. 
Eisendrath declined comment 
for this story through an Athletic 
Department spokesman.

The job posting summarized 

Eisendrath’s 
role 
as: 

“The 
Director 
of 
Internal 

Communications 
assists 

the 
football 
coach 
in 
all 

areas, 
including 
day-to-day 

operations, 
communications, 

office 
management 
and 

administration. 
He/she 

works directly with the U-M 
administrators, coaches and 
student-athletes 
to 
promote 

and maintain a positive brand 
image 
for 
the 
Michigan 

football 
program. 
This 

individual is also responsible 
for working with all related 
departments to ensure that the 
football program is providing 
a collaborative message that 
integrates with the athletic 
department initiatives.”

According to the original job 

posting, the role is 80 percent 
operations 
and 
20 
percent 

communications. The operations 

part of the job involves tasks 
such as maintaining the coach’s 
personal 
and 
professional 

contacts and assisting the head 
coach with personal appearances 
and off-season engagement.

And yes, the communications 

portion of the job description 
does mention helping out with 
the coach’s personal Twitter 
account, though Harbaugh has 
said that his famous Twitter 
account contains only his own 
thoughts.

So 
what 
does 
Harbaugh 

think about Eisendrath? On 
Eisendrath’s 
birthday, 
four 

days before the job was posted, 
Harbaugh 
tweeted: 
“Happy 

Birthday to Zach Eisendrath! 
He’s a quick study! Moved 
swiftly 
from 
obscurity 
to 

Known 
Friend 
& 
Trusted 

Agent!”

ProKick and worked with O’Neill. 
Utah, Oregon State, Rutgers, 
Penn State and Ohio State all have 
Australian punters who O’Neill is 
familiar with.

“We’re all good mates,” he said.
The 
exception 
among 

Australian 
college 
football 

special teamers, O’Neill noted, is 
Maryland kicker Brad Craddock, 
last year’s Lou Groza Award 
winner for college football’s top 
kicker. Craddock did not train 
at ProKick, and O’Neill and 
Craddock have never met.

The 
bond 
between 
the 

Australian punters has been 
apparent on the field during the 
first two games of Michigan’s 
season. O’Neill was the last 
Wolverine on the field after the 
season opener at Utah, delayed 
as he greeted Hackett after the 
game. This week, O’Neill said 
he felt for his friend and Oregon 
State punter Nick Porebski as 

he took the roughing the kicker 
penalty that Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh vehemently argued. 
(O’Neill agreed with Harbaugh 
that the penalty should not have 
been called and that Porebski was 
out of the pocket.)

For now, O’Neill is enjoying his 

final year of his college football 
career. 
Sure, 
his 
teammates 

occasionally have pictures of his 
modeling career in the locker 
room, but he doesn’t seem to 
mind. O’Neill has punted six 
times in Michigan’s first two 
games for an average of 42.8 
yards. Two of his punts have 
pinned the Wolverines’ opponent 
inside its own 20-yard line.

O’Neill is working toward 

his master’s degree in sport 
management, and said he would 
love to punt in the NFL, though 
he acknowledges there are just 
32 jobs. If worst comes to worst, 
he can always take a page out of 
Zoolander’s book.

“The Blake O’Neill School for 

Kids Who Can’t Punt Good” has a 
certain ring to it.
