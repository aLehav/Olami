N. Campus Grove 

project also up 
for approval at 

Thursday meeting 

By GEN HUMMER 

and ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporters

The University’s Board of 

Regents will consider two North 
Campus construction projects at 
their monthly meeting on Thurs-
day.

The regents will vote to 

approve a $13 million proposal to 
renovate the North Campus Rec-
reation Building and schematic 
designs for a $6.9 outdoor public 
space on North Campus.

Built in 1976, the NCRB will 

be updated as a part of the larger 
initiative to improve the Univer-
sity’s unions and recreational 
sports facilities.

The proposed NCRB renova-

tion will add 18,000 square foot 
to the existing space — making 
room for a new gymnasium, car-
dio and group exercise spaces 
and a new entry to the building.

A 50,000 square foot renova-

tion of the existing building is 
planned to update the racquet-
ball courts, restrooms and lock-
er rooms. The project will also 
include electrical, heating and 
plumbing system upgrades.

The improvements will be 

funded by the Student Life Stu-
dent Fee for Facility Renewal. 
The $65-per-term student fee 
was approved by the regents in 
April 2013.

The design phase of the proj-

ect is scheduled to begin imme-
diately, pending authorization 
from the Board, and will be 
contracted to Integrated Design 
Solutions in association with 
RDG Planning and Design.

During February’s meeting, 

the Board approved a $21.4 mil-
lion construction budget for 
renovations to the University’s 
Intramural Sports Building, also 
funded by student fees.

Thursday, the regents with 

likely allow the University to 
move forward with seeking bids 
and awarding construction con-
tracts.

The IM Building was the first 

university recreational sports 
facility in the country, built in 
1928.

Panelists celebrate 
20th anniversary of 
women and gender 

institute 

By EMMA KINERY

Dauly Staff Reporter

In celebration of the 20th 

anniversary of the University’s 
Institute for Research on Women 

and Gender, a panel of feminist 
scholars looked back on the his-
tory of various academic depart-
ments related to feminism and 
considered the future of feminist 
research.

Panelists explored key focuses 

of discussion over the past 20 
years, including gender and sex-
uality.

Kathleen Canning, professor 

of history, women’s studies and 
German, discussed how the focus 
of feminist theory has shifted 

from an emphasis on the body to 
defining gender, and ultimately 
toward the study of sexuality. 
Canning said while instructing a 
recent course on gender and sex-
uality, students were most inter-
ested in components pertaining 
to sexuality.

She noted that of the incoming 

class of women’s studies gradu-
ate students, about half of the 
students’ focus was on sexuality 
in some way.

“Now I would say sexuality 

is much more in the foreground 
than body or gender,” Canning 
said.

Both the University’s Center 

for the Education of Women and 
the women’s studies major were 
established prior to the Institute 
for Research on Women and Gen-
der’s founding in 1995.

Patricia Gurin, a former pro-

fessor of psychology and women’s 
studies, provided panel atten-
dants with a brief history of the

MCards will no 

longer link to TCF 

bank accounts 
starting in April

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

TCF Bank announced Monday 

that it will end its Mcard partner-
ship with the University effective 
April 30. According to an e-mail 
distributed to students, TCF 
account holders will no longer 
be able to use an Mcard as a valid 
ATM or debit card.

The announcement marks the 

end of an almost 14-year partner-
ship between the University and 
TCF.

Kim Broekhuizen, a University 

public affairs representative, said 
TCF informed the University last 
fall they would not renew their 
partnership.

“While the features associated 

with TCF bank accounts held by 
students and employees won’t 
change after the contract ends, 
it will no longer be possible to 
use the Mcard as an ATM card,” 
she said. “Customers can still use 
their TCF Visa Check Card to 
access their accounts, including 
through ATMs.”

Mark Goldman, TCF director 

of corporate communications, 
said the bank and the Univer-
sity have worked well together 

throughout their partnership.

“Whenever our contracts with 

our various University partners 
are due to come up for renewal, 
we look at a variety of factors, 
including the length of agree-
ment, service expectations and 
overall financial commitments,” 
Goldman said. “We ultimately 
make a decision that in the best 
interest of both the University 
and TCF.”

Goldman said he could not 

comment on the process by 
which the decision was made or 
whether there were negotiations 
between TCF and the University 
for renewal.

“The same benefits that stu-

dents are receiving through the 
specially-designated 
student 

account with TCF will continue 
despite the exit of the relation-
ship with the University,” Gold-
man said.

According to a 2014 University 

finance department document, 
about 40 percent of new students 
open a TCF Bank account.

The announcement also states 

that some of the bank’s ATMs 
will stay in University buildings. 
Goldman said the exact buildings 
and ATMs are up for consider-
ation and TCF is working close 
with the University to keep as 
many as TCF ATMs possible.

“This discussion is ongoing 

and we expect some kind of reso-
lution in the very near future,” 
Goldman said. “And of course we 
are committed to letting our cus-

Meeting continues 

despite silent 
protest over 

police brutality 

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

extensively debated changes 
to an ordinance that addresses 
the maintenance of sidewalks, 
specifically related to snow and 
ice removal policy. A vote on 
the amendment was ultimately 
postponed.

Monday’s meeting proceeded 

amid a silent protest condemn-
ing police brutality surround-
ing the killing of Aura Rosser, 
an Ann Arbor resident who 

was shot by a police officer in 
December. Protesters held signs 
and remained silent during the 
meeting, and Council continued 
with the meeting as scheduled.

The current city policy states 

residents must clear their side-
walks of snow within 24 hours 
if snow exceeds one inch. New 
language 
proposed 
would 

require residents to remove 
snow on their sidewalks within 
24 hours regardless of the accu-
mulation.

During discussion, council-

members argued that the cur-
rent snow removal policy is 
difficult to enforce. Multiple 
amendments 
were 
proposed 

and additional changes were 
discussed after members of the 
public were allowed to express 
their concerns. These stricter 
amendments 
would 
directly 

affect students living off cam-
pus, who could be subject to 
more severe consequences if a 
future ordinance were to pass.

The Pedestrian Safety and 

Access 
Task 
Force 
recom-

mended several changes to 
the ordinance. The changes to 
the ordinance clarify property 
owners’ responsibility in regard 
to snow and ice removal. The 
changes also seek to clarify the 
consequences for noncompli-
ance.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) said 
he would support amending 
the ordinance, though he noted 
critics who argue a dusting of 
snow does not present a hazard 
to pedestrians.

“Let’s have the conversation 

after we’ve tried it,” Warpe-

FDA approved the 
machine earlier this 
week for patients in 
need of transplant

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

A team of University research-

ers is successfully keeping lungs 
alive outside the body — with the 
help of a new machine.

In a clinical trial, the Universi-

ty is working to evaluate a recent-
ly developed machine — called 
the XVIVO Perfusion System — 
to keep donated organs viable for 
transplant while they’re outside 
of the body. The machine was 
first developed in Sweden in 2011.

The trial is in collaboration 

with Gift of Life Michigan, an 
Ann Arbor-based organ donation 
non-profit, and the Henry Ford 
and Spectrum health systems.

When an organ is removed 

from a body under normal cir-
cumstances, the cells begin to 
deteriorate quickly, making the 
transplant process difficult. Not 
only do the organs have to be a 
match for the patient, doctors 
must also transplant the organs 
quickly before they are damaged.

The U.S. Food and Drug 

Administration 
approved 
the 

machine earlier this week for 
patients in need of a transplant.

AMANDA PARKER

Fashion blogging

RITA MORRIS/Daily

LSA freshman Kelly Guerin enjoys the warm weather 
playing catch on Palmer Field on Monday. 

SPRING THAW

Two months ago, Business 

sophomore Amanda Parker found-
ed “Mittens and Manolos,” a fash-
ion blog dedicated to showcasing 
her personal style with influence 
from her hometown, Alexandria, 
Va. Looking to expand her content, 
Parker plans to review runway 
trends for the upcoming summer 
season.

What inspired you to start 

your blog?

I’ve always been really inter-

ested in fashion and since the 
blogging scene in the fashion 
industry has become so big, I’ve 
thought about starting my own 
blog for a while. As I’ve become 
more serious about wanting to 

pursue a career in fashion, I fig-
ured there was no better time 
than right now to launch a blog 
and start getting more involved 
in the industry.

What is the focus of your 

blog?

Currently, my blog focuses on 

my personal style, which I would 
describe as classic with a bohe-
mian twist. I want to expand it 
soon to include more content 
about seasonal runway trends. I 
love watching and seeing pictures 
of the runway shows at fashion 
week, so I think it would be cool 
to incorporate content about that. 
I want my blog to be a source of 
inspiration for people looking for 

new ideas, so updating content 
and introducing new topics is 
important.

How does being in Ross 

School of Business give you 
a unique perspective on the 

fashion industry?

I think being in Ross has 

helped me think of my blog from 
an entrepreneurial perspective 
and consider how I can develop 
it from a business standpoint. I 
am always looking for ways to 
increase my viewer base, so cre-
ating marketing strategy is really 
important in getting new readers 
and subscribers.

McDonald’s employees 
detail burns, job hazards 

Workers across the 
country campaign for 

unionization and
 $15 an hour pay

NEW YORK (AP) — McDon-

ald’s workers in 19 cities have filed 
complaints over burns from pop-
ping grease, a lack of protective 
equipment and other workplace 
hazards, according to labor orga-
nizers.

The complaints are the latest 

move in an ongoing campaign to 
win pay of $15 an hour and union-
ization for fast-food workers by 
publicly pressuring McDonald’s to 
come to the bargaining table. The 
push is being spearheaded by the 
Service Employees International 
Union and began more than two 
years ago. Already, it has included 
protests around the country and 
lawsuits alleging workers weren’t 
given their rightful pay.

The burns and other haz-

ards were detailed in complaints 
announced Monday and filed 
with U.S. Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration in recent 
weeks. Workers cite a persistent 
lack of gloves for handling hot 
equipment and say they’ve been 
burned while cleaning grills that 
have to be kept on. One worker 
says he was told by a manager to, 
“put mayonnaise on it, you’ll be 
good.”

The complaints also detail a 

lack of training for handling 
hot fryers and slipping on wet 
floors.

A representative for the Labor 

Department, Laura McGinnis, 
confirmed the complaints were 
received by OSHA but said the 
agency does not discuss ongoing 
investigations.

In a statement, McDonald’s 

Corp. said the company and its 
independent 
franchisees 
are 

committed to providing safe 
working conditions for employ-

ees, and will review the allega-
tions. “It is important to note 
that these complaints are part 
of a larger strategy orchestrated 
by activists targeting our brand 
and designed to generate media 
coverage,” 
Heidi 
Barker 
Sa 

Shekhem, a McDonald’s spokes-
woman, said in the statement.

The complaints extend a cen-

tral theme of the “Fight for $15” 
campaign, which has been to 
hold McDonald’s accountable 
for working conditions at its 
franchised locations. 

That would ease the way for 

worker negotiations and union-
ization across the company’s 
more than 14,000 U.S. res-
taurants, the vast majority of 
which are run by franchisees. 
McDonald’s and other fast-food 
chains, including Burger King 
and Wendy’s, have said they’re 
not responsible for employment 
decisions at franchised restau-
rants.

The matter has reached the 

general counsel of the National 
Labor Relations Board, which 
said late last year that McDon-
ald’s could be named as a joint 
employer 
in 
complaints 
by 

workers. Those complaints have 
yet to be heard, but whichever 
side loses is expected to appeal 
the decision.

Kendall 
Fells, 
organizing 

director for Fight for $15, said 
the injuries at franchised and 
company-owned 
restaurants 

mostly came about because 
understaffing and employees 
being told to work too quickly — 
both of which he said were the 
result of a computer system that 
tracks sales and staffing met-
rics.

The computer system was also 

cited in lawsuits last year that 
allege “wage theft” by McDon-
ald’s and its franchisees for the 
denial of breaks and overtime 
pay. That system has been key 
in the argument by labor groups 
that McDonald’s exerts enough 
control over franchised restau-
rants to be considered a joint 
employer.

European powers, Iran 
talk nuclear agreement

Little progress made 

towards finding a 

solution to 

weapons problem

BRUSSELS (AP) — European 

powers and Iran made little 
progress late Monday toward 
reaching an agreement to end 
the 
standoff 
over Tehran’s 

nuclear program as an end-of-
March deadline closes in.

“We’re still making progress 

but there is a long way to go if 
we’re going to get there,” Brit-
ish Foreign Secretary Philip 
Hammond said, after talks in 
Brussels with his French, Ger-
man and Iranian counterparts 
plus European Union foreign 
policy chief Federica Mogh-
erini.

The talks were aimed at nar-

rowing gaps in the positions 
between Iran and the world 
powers, as part of a 15 month 
negotiating process that could 
see Iran freeze its nuclear pro-

gram for at least a decade in 
exchange for the gradual lifting 
of international sanctions.

Iran says the program is 

aimed at generating electric-
ity and at medical research, 
but many in the West fear the 
Islamic republic is trying to 
covertly build atomic weapons.

“It’s always useful to talk but 

we, the French, want a solid 
deal,” said French Foreign Min-
ister Laurent Fabius. “Certain 
points are yet to be resolved, we 
hope we will be able to resolve 
them but as long as it’s not done, 
it’s not done.”

Mogherini, who is negotiat-

ing with Iran on behalf of the 
world’s five nuclear powers 
and Germany, said that all sides 
were aware how important it 
is to seal a good deal and that 
it was not clear whether “a 
technical solution” to fill the 
remaining gaps can be found.

“I see the elements for a deal 

to be reached but I still see the 
gaps that need to be filled,” she 
said.

Ahead of the meeting, Ger-

man Foreign Minister Frank-
Walter Steinmeier urged his 
international partners and Iran 
to “seize this opportunity” of 
talks in Brussels and in Swit-
zerland this week to finally 
clinch an elusive deal.

The world powers and Iran 

have 
set 
an 
end-of-March 

deadline to reach a framework 
accord on the way ahead. 

Some officials have said 

persistent 
differences 
mean 

negotiators could settle for an 
announcement 
that 
they’ve 

made enough progress to jus-
tify further talks.

Senior officials from the 

world powers will continue 
negotiations with Iran in Lau-
sanne, Switzerland on Wednes-
day.

Iranian 
Foreign 
Minister 

Mohammad Javad Zarif, who 
represented Iran in Brussels, 
will also hold several days of 
discussions with U.S. Secretary 
of State John Kerry in Switzer-
land this week, as momentum 
builds in the nuclear negotia-
tions.

the entire community.”

The end of the partnership 

may not mean the end of the 
Mcard as a banking tool.

“The University has been 

reviewing proposals to select 
a new banking partner and 
expects to finalize its decision 
in the near future,” Broekhui-
zen said.

The project includes the addi-

tion of new racquetball courts, 
locker rooms and group fitness 
and weightlifting rooms, as well 
as infrastructure upgrades.

“The project will preserve the 

history of the 87-year-old iconic 
facility,” said E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, at 
the February regents meeting. 
“It will also promote the health 
and wellness of our students, 
faculty and staff.”

North Campus Grove 

project

The regents will also consider 

schematic designs for the North 
Campus Grove project, as well 
as grant the University autho-
rization to award construction 
contracts.

The existing North Campus 

central lawn spans four acres 
and serves as the main outdoor 
gathering space on North Cam-
pus. The grove project will cre-
ate an informal amphitheater 
and add a new central plaza to 
the lawn, as well as walkways, 
seating, trees and improved 
lighting, water and electrical 
infrastructure.

The proposed improvements 

will facilitate more opportuni-
ties for outdoor events, activities 
and displays on North Campus.

The regents approved the 

project at their meeting last 
April.

The project will be funded by 

gifts and College of Engineering 
resources.

Scheduled for fall of 2015 

completion, the improvements 
are projected to create 27 on-site 
construction jobs.

Dr. William Lynch, Univer-

sity associate professor of sur-
gery, said with the system, the 
lungs are able to remain healthy 
outside of a body for 15 to 16 
hours, which gives surgeons 
more time to determine their 
viability for transplant.

“The main purpose is to 

get more lungs to transplant 
patients,” Lynch said.

Since the implementation 

of the system in 2011, nine 
other centers in the United 
States have been 
involved in this 
clinical 
trail, 

resulting in about 
68 
lung 
trans-

plants.

The trial seeks 

to 
demonstrate 

the safety of the 
machine 
and 

the procedure to 
ensure the FDA requirements 
have been met. It also gathers 
data that will allow scientists 
to get an idea of the technique’s 
efficiency.

Through a process called ex 

vivo lung perfusion, the lungs 
are attached to a machine that 
keeps them alive outside of 
the body. One tube from the 
machine pushes fluid through 
the lungs, which pulls water 
out of the lung tissue and keeps 
it healthy. The other tube 
pumps air into and out of the 
lungs, allowing oxygen to cir-
culate.

The machine was first used 

for a transplant at the Univer-
sity two weeks ago and involved 
transplanting lungs that were 
kept outside the body for 15 to 16 
hours, almost twice the amount 
of time normally safe for lungs, 
Lynch said.

“Right now, we have about 

15 to 20 minutes to decide if 
the lungs will work well in the 
patient,” Lynch said.

Since there is no time to 

observe the lungs before they 
are transplanted, surgeons are 
forced to be overly cautious.

Currently, only about 20 per-

cent of available lungs are actu-
ally being transplanted. In the 
United States, there are about 
1,600 to 1,700 lung transplants 
a year, but there are 160,000 
people that would benefit from 
a lung transplant. There are 

about 8,000 lung donors, but 
less than 2,000 of them are 
being used.

University alum Fares Algha-

nem, a research assistant in the 
Extracorporeal Life Support 
Lab, said the trial could have 
lasting impacts for organ trans-
plants.

“There’s a weird disconnect 

now,” Alghanem said. “We’re 
not using all the lungs avail-
able for transplant, but we’re 
not able to give transplants to 
everyone who needs it.”

In addition to keeping lungs 

viable outside a body, the 
machine also allows more lung 

transplants 
to 

occur.

“You can take 

the lungs for a test 
drive,” Lynch said. 
“By being able to 
take the lungs out 
and observe them 
for a few hours, 
surgeons would be 
able to confidently 

transplant the lungs that may 
get wasted currently because 
there is a slight doubt about 
them and not enough time to 
observe.”

Lynch said he is especially 

excited about the future possi-
bilities that could arise from the 
clinical trial.

“The real interesting future 

is going to be when these kind 
of machines can support organs 
for a prolonged period of times,” 
Lynch said.

Currently, lungs can only be 

kept outside for hours, but it 
is a possibility that soon there 
will be ways to keep them 
viable for days.

“Conceptually, there’s no 

reason we can’t take a cancer-
ous lung out of a person, keep 
them alive, cure the lung, and 
then put it back in.”

This clinical trial is a step in 

that direction, Lynch said, and 
the future of medicine could 
change dramatically with this 
new technology.

Alghanem said the research 

could allow for a type of organ 
bank, where organs are kept 
alive with machines like the 
XVIVO Perfusion System, and 
they could be readily available 
for transplant when needed.

“This 
type 
of 
cutting-

edge research inspires you to 
want to push the boundaries 
of medicine even further,” 
Alghanem said.

development of these depart-
ments. Gurin, who began her 
tenure at the University in 1966, 
also discussed her experience 
with a particular University pol-
icy, the Michigan Mandate.

Gurin said former University 

President James Duderstadt’s 
1988 policy, which aimed to cre-
ate a more inclusive commu-
nity at the University, but didn’t 
address women as part of the 
framework. In response, Gurin 
participated in an assembly to 
address the issue.

“He listened to that,” Gurin 

said. “That’s when President 
Duderstadt 
enunciated 
the 

women’s agenda, and IRWG 
comes along as a really wonder-
ful place where it’s not just about 
women’s lives, it’s about wom-
en’s scholarship. Twenty years 
later, there is really an enormous 
amount of scholarship that has 
come out of IRWG.”

Each panelist discussed their 

individual work and how it 
changed over time.

Canning spoke first about her 

interest in feminist scholarship 
and the body, particularly what 
the definition of the body is and 
what it has meant throughout 
time. During the research for 
her article “The Body as Meth-
od? Reflections on the Place of 
the Body in Gender History,” 
Canning found that the defini-
tion is not fixed and is dependent 
on other elements.

“I see the three terms: gen-

der, body and sexuality, as a set 
of moving parts that are almost 
always connected to one anoth-
er, even if one or another might 
be very hegemonic at any given 
point,” Canning said. “So I see it 
as our task to actually dig down 
and try to excavate the ways to 
which the terms relate to each 
other.”

As a psychologist, Gurin’s dis-

cussion concerned how feminist 
theory has become increasingly 
prevalent in the field of psychol-
ogy. Twenty years ago, Gurin 
said feminist scholarship was 
alien in the field of psychology.

Gurin also said gender has 

now become more than just a 
variable in research groups and 
that the movement away from 
binary gender has opened up 
psychology to more research. 
Today the focus is not as much 
on men or women, but rather 
different types of men and 
women as the groupings have 
become broader.

Valerie Traub, professor of 

English and women’s studies, 
said she doesn’t see the study of 
feminism fading from academic 
spheres anytime soon.

“Circulating 
within 
the 

humanities are a variety of criti-
cisms about feminism’s fate: 
fears of the success of a conser-
vative reaction against femi-
nism within in the academy and 
without … ambivalence about 
feminism’s 
entanglement 
in 

academic knowledge, anxiet-
ies about the displacement of 
feminism,” Traub said. “My own 
sense is that announcements of 
the death of feminism in literary 

studies are premature.”

Many attendees were inter-

ested in how feminist studies 
expanded in disciplines beyond 
the humanities. As a psycholo-
gist, Gurin was able to speak on 
behalf of feminist practices in 
the medical field, but others dis-
cussed how feminist theory has 
been involved in business and 
engineering.

Monday’s venue was filled 

with about 50 graduate students, 
many of whom were happy to 
make use of the forum to further 
their own studies.

Engineering freshman Diana 

Thompson, who is in the women 
in science program, was also 
interested in where the two 
fields intersect.

“I thought that this would 

kind of relate but not directly, 
so I could see a different per-
spective of where feminism 
is,” Thompson said. “Feminism 
in these fields is a lot different 
than engineering. It’s very much 
more theoretical.”

Matthieu Dupas, a graduate 

student of French literature and 
gender studies in the Depart-
ment of Romance Languages 
and Literatures, enjoyed the 
variety of disciplines involved in 
the conversation.

“It was very nice to have femi-

nist scholars coming in from dif-
ferent disciplines and together 
endeavoring 
to 
picture 
the 

evolution of the interdisciplin-
ary fields of women’s studies,” 
Dupas said. “For us, these schol-
ars are at the peak of their field, 
and so it’s very cool to have their 
perspectives.”

hoski said. “We are unable to 
enforce the ordinance in years 
that there is been frequent 
snow … The existing ordinance 
requires that each citation have 
a warning before it so if we are 
getting snow after snow after 
snow... we have property owners 
that can just ride that out with-
out citation.”

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1) offered a substitu-
tion amendment. Briere suggest-
ed Council consider removing 
language that implied a property 
owner must remove snow or ice 
immediately, as snow may fall 

at inconvenient times such as in 
the middle of the night or day.

After 
an 
extensive 
pub-

lic hearing session in which 
eight residents expressed their 
concerns pertaining to this 
resolution, Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor said the 
need for clear sidewalks is cru-
cial to the citizens of Ann Arbor 
and that standards should not be 
lowered.

According to research by 

the Ann Arbor Pedestrian Task 
Force, changes requiring snow 
removal at any accumulation are 
necessary and would bring Ann 
Arbor to state standards.

“What we’ve heard from the 

Pedestrian Safety Task Force is 
that truly dozens of Michigan 

cities have an all snow stan-
dard,” Taylor said. “Buffalo has 
an all snow standard.”

“... I think that we’ve heard 

today that our residents rely 
on the sidewalks for transit, 
and we should do all we can to 
ensure that they’re passable to 
all that need them, and although 
I appreciate a lot of what’s in 
here, I think walking back for 
me, walking back from that stan-
dard, is a place I’d rather not go,” 
Taylor said.

Council will reevaluate this 

issue after a public hearing 
scheduled for April 20, where 
they hope to listen to more com-
ments from members of the Ann 
Arbor Commission on Disability 
Issues.

Iran, European nations 
make little progress in talks

Negotiations aim 
to freeze Iranian 
nuclear program

BRUSSELS (AP) — European 

powers and Iran made little 
progress late Monday toward 
reaching an agreement to end 
the 
standoff 
over 
Tehran’s 

nuclear program as an end-of-
March deadline closes in.

“We’re still making progress 

but there is a long way to go if 
we’re going to get there,” British 
Foreign Secretary Philip Ham-
mond said, after talks in Brus-
sels with his French, German 
and Iranian counterparts plus 
European Union foreign policy 
chief Federica Mogherini.

The talks were aimed at nar-

rowing gaps in the positions 
between Iran and the world 
powers, as part of a 15 month 
negotiating process that could 
see Iran freeze its nuclear pro-
gram for at least a decade in 
exchange for the gradual lifting 

of international sanctions.

Iran says the program is 

aimed at generating electric-
ity and at medical research, but 
many in the West fear the Islam-
ic republic is trying to covertly 
build atomic weapons.

“It’s always useful to talk but 

we, the French, want a solid 
deal,” said French Foreign Min-
ister Laurent Fabius. “Certain 
points are yet to be resolved, we 
hope we will be able to resolve 
them but as long as it’s not done, 
it’s not done.”

Mogherini, who is negotiat-

ing with Iran on behalf of the 
world’s five nuclear powers and 
Germany, said that all sides 
were aware how important it 
is to seal a good deal and that it 
was not clear whether “a techni-
cal solution” to fill the remain-
ing gaps can be found.

“I see the elements for a deal 

to be reached but I still see the 
gaps that need to be filled,” she 
said.

Ahead of the meeting, Ger-

man Foreign Minister Frank-

Walter Steinmeier urged his 
international partners and Iran 
to “seize this opportunity” of 
talks in Brussels and in Switzer-
land this week to finally clinch 
an elusive deal.

The world powers and Iran 

have 
set 
an 
end-of-March 

deadline to reach a framework 
accord on the way ahead. Some 
officials have said persistent dif-
ferences mean negotiators could 
settle for an announcement that 
they’ve made enough progress 
to justify further talks.

Senior officials from the 

world powers will continue 
negotiations with Iran in Laus-
anne, Switzerland on Wednes-
day.

Iranian 
Foreign 
Minister 

Mohammad Javad Zarif, who 
represented Iran in Brussels, 
will also hold several days of 
discussions with U.S. Secretary 
of State John Kerry in Switzer-
land this week, as momentum 
builds in the nuclear negotia-
tions.

CALEDONIA TOWNSHIP, Mich. 
15 year-old boy held 
for stabbing sister 

A 15-year-old western Michi-

gan boy was ordered held Mon-
day as authorities investigate the 
stabbing of his 13-year-old sister 
in their Caledonia Township 
home.

Kent County Family Court 

Referee Lynn Perry made the 
ruling while acting on a motion 
from prosecutors, The Grand 
Rapids Press reported.

Sheriff’s deputies found the 

girl with multiple stab wounds 
about 1 p.m. Saturday after her 
15-year-old brother called 911. 
She was taken by an emergency 
helicopter to a Grand Rapids 
hospital. Authorities have not 
released the condition. 

NEW ORLEANS
Real estate tycoon 
charged in murder

Los Angeles prosecutors have 

filed a murder charge against 
real estate heir Robert Durst that 
could carry the death penalty.

Prosecutors said Durst was 

charged 
Monday 
with 
first-

degree murder in the killing of 
his friend, Susan Berman.

Durst was arrested in New 

Orleans over the weekend on 
a murder warrant and waived 
extradition to return to Los 
Angeles to face the charges.

Berman had acted as Durst’s 

spokeswoman after his wife dis-
appeared in 1982.

She was shot in the back of the 

head in her Los Angeles home 
in December 2000 just before 
New York authorities planned 
to interview her about Kathleen 
Durst’s disappearance.

LOS ANGELES 
Arrest warrant 
issued for cop

An arrest warrant was issued 

Monday for a rookie Los Angeles 
policeman suspected of killing 
a man during a fight in Pomona 
while he was off duty.

The murder warrant is for 

Henry Solis, 27, who should be 
considered armed and danger-
ous, according to a statement 
from Pomona police.

Solis’ 
Volkswagen 
Jetta 

was found Sunday about four 
blocks from where the shooting 
occurred, and he may be driving 
a 1992 brown or tan Ford pickup 
truck with license plate number 
4J79703, police said.

Solis is suspected of shooting 

Salome Rodriguez, 23, of Ontar-
io, around 3:30 a.m. Friday dur-
ing a fight near Third and Main 
streets in this city east of Los 
Angeles. He died at a hospital.

KINSHASA, Congo
Diplomat freed 
from detention

An 
American 
diplomat 

has been released after being 
detained in Congo during a raid 
in which journalists and democ-
racy activists were also arrest-
ed, the Congolese government 
spokesman said Monday.

Sunday’s detentions come at a 

time of rising tension in Congo, 
where 
some 
fear 
President 

Joseph Kabila is attempting to 
prolong his time in power after 
his term ends next year.

The raid followed a news con-

ference in Kinshasa to support 
a Congo’s Filimbi movement 
that aims to get more youths to 
participate in politics. Those 
arrested were suspected of being 
a threat to national security, 
according to Lambert Mende, 
the government spokesman.

The 
U.S. 
diplomat 
was 

released overnight, Mende said, 
adding that the news conference 
was “no place for a diplomat.” 
He did not disclose the diplo-
mat’s name or position and the 
U.S. State Department has not 
offered any additional informa-
tion.

S

he told me she was collecting little 
white pebbles. We sat on the green 
bench of our senior lawn and talked 

about blackness.

She asked me if I had ever 

had that feeling that I was 
missing out. That feeling 
that 
creeps 
up 
on 
you 

when you realize there is 
something else. Something 
more. 
Something 
bigger 

than you. Or outside of you. 
You know the feeling, like 
you are almost there, but 
not quite. Hovering under 
the threshold but needed 
someone to reach up from 
above and pull you through the ocean’s 
surface. She told me that’s what she needed. 
“I think that’s it,” she questioned. One 
 

more stroke.

Sometimes that shallow pond is more 

similar to swimming from the ocean’s base 
with a bag of bricks roped around your feet. 
Or maybe it’s just someone peeling open 
 

your eyes.

She asked that the feeling be lifted off of 

her chest. The boulder of darkness. Lift off. 
She told me it was just a white pebble. Perhaps 
jammed in the palm of her hand. Or caught 
beneath her fingernail. Or worst, caught in her 
ear. It seemed to me that it was lodged in her 
throat, or the tear duct of her eye. She told me 
it was nothing serious. Only white she said, 
not too dark, not too black. More translucent. 
It will pass.

She called me one evening. I was sitting by a 

friend’s fire pit. Her more-than-a-friend at the 
time sat there too. Wearing yellow, I danced 
with the fire.

My friend buzzed in my pocket. She asked 

me if I remembered her little white stone. The 
collection, she reminded me. Her little bag of 

white stones that she kept beneath her bed. The 
ones that strapped her to Earth’s floor.

“It seems we have a problem” she hushed 

over the phone. The little white stones, she 
had misplaced them. She thought she had 
tucked them away into a place where they 
would stay put. Where they couldn’t run too 
far. Or drag her down too hard. Wreak havoc. 
“I thought maybe I would pass them to my 
children one day, but it seems this may no 
longer be the case.” She hummed some more.

“The stones have been replaced. Would you 

come over and see what I found. It’s hard to 
explain,” she told me.

“Of course,” I said. I asked if I could tell 

her more-than-a-friend what had happened. 
She said he wasn’t a rock collector himself. 
He may not understand. Or maybe he just had 
too many to count.

I left the fire and arrived at her front 

door. Down the steps. Her younger sister 
watched television. The middle child painted. 
A mother and friend took tequila shots. 
Unaware of where their sister and daughter 
and friend was taking me. Glassy eyes globed 
in milk. Ignore them, she told me.

We descended down the staircase, past 

the rainbow cave and hookah pipes. Past the 
portraits of the four siblings, once jovial.

Peering 
into 
the 
mother’s 
room, 

where a new boyfriend stood, staring 
 

into nothingness.

The last photograph that normally hung on 

the wall was a picture of her “old” family with 
her father who had found another woman. 
The picture and frame had been removed.

We arrived at the bottom of the stairs. She 

told me her light switch was broken. The door 
was also jammed, but if you push really hard 
you may be able to peer in.

T

his semester, I was given the oppor-
tunity to write and direct my first 
short film. A narrative about men-

tal health, it’s to premiere 
along with other student 
films at the Michigan The-
ater in April.

This has been a passion 

project pent up in my head 
for so long, now one I can 
finally bring to life. As a 
creator, there is a certain 
responsibility to myself and 
to the narrative that bur-
dens me. In the past week, 
I have slept less than 24 
hours, tossing and turning 
in anxiety, planning late at night to ensure 
everything could be as perfect as possible. 
We just finished filming this past weekend; I 
feel like I just gave birth. Despite the stress, I 
have learned more about creative teamwork 
than I ever have on any other project.

“Creativity” and “artistry” have always 

been elusive concepts. How does one actually 
be creative? Are certain types of creativity 
more effective? To what extent can you label 
or self-identify as an artist? Quite paradoxi-
cally to its name, creativity can often be the 
most rigid.

I am the writer and director — which in 

many cases could have been synonymous with 
dictator. In many instances, I would typically 
want complete, unhindered, uncontested con-
trol. I have this immense connection to the 
work I toiled over for so long; it is a story that 
has deep meaning to me, a creative vision that I 
want to bring to life exactly as it is in my head. 
I wanted to insist more takes when the image 
didn’t adhere word for word to the script. How-
ever, in this exactness, creativity becomes more 
of a science than the art it should be.

Filmmaking is a process that requires cre-

ative decisions to come in the moment — and 

also with the input of a team. To me, creativ-
ity always seems like an individual pursuit. 
Creativity means being introspective, tap-
ping into deeper emotions and finding inner 
inspiration based on outside influence.

Quite the contrary, especially as a first-

time director, I needed the input of indi-
viduals with far more experience than I had. 
Filmmaking is not — and cannot be — a solo 
process. The insight of the director of photog-
raphy, producer, assistant director and other 
crew members are what enhance the vision. 
Since childhood, group work has always been 
the bane of every student, as it’s unlikely 
every group member will pull an equiva-
lent weight and also see eye to eye on every 
decision. On a film set, though, collaboration 
is not what makes the process a nuisance. 
Rather, it is an integral, vital part of the 
creative process. 

I could have never completed this project 

without a team that, albeit with a few artistic 
disagreements, was so dedicated to putting its 
best interests into this movie. Essentially, in 
the process of translating work onto a screen, 
creativity becomes about the relinquishment of 
control and the contribution of a team.

What I have struggled to learn is that cre-

ativity is not about perfection. Maybe I am 
just realizing this now, but it is a struggle 
many other creators have regularly as well. 
Now, I can only imagine how those in Holly-
wood could ever manage feature-length proj-
ects without the help of massive teams — it 
just wouldn’t be possible. It has been a diffi-
cult, incredibly stressful process putting my 
vision to life — but I am learning to relinquish 
control and trust others.

For now, I am incredibly grateful for this 

opportunity and so immensely proud. And 
that’s a wrap.

BEN KELLER | VIEWPOINT

Mike Mansfield’s birthday

Recently, 47 U.S. Senators sent 

a letter to the leaders of Iran 
in an effort to derail current 
negotiations with President Barack 
Obama. 
Forget 
party 
politics 

for a minute — this was an overt 
attempt by members of Congress 
to go behind the back of a sitting 
President while he was conducting 
foreign policy. This kind of action 
is 
unprecedented, 
and 
reflects 

the sorry state of affairs not just 
between Capitol Hill and the White 
House, but also between almost 
every branch and department of 
our federal government.

Yesterday, March 16, would have 

been the 112th birthday of Michael 
Joseph Mansfield. He held many 
titles throughout his life — Marine 
Corps private, member of the U.S. 
House of Representatives, majority 
leader of the Senate and U.S. 
ambassador to Japan, among others. 
He presided over the Senate’s 
functions for 17 consecutive years — 
something no other majority leader 
has surpassed. Mansfield was a 
soft-spoken, humble, generous and 
pragmatic giant of his time. It’s the 
way he conducted himself within 
our nation’s capital that should 
be remembered on March 16, in 
the face of so much congressional 
stagnation and petty politics.

A terrific biography written about 

Mansfield by Don Oberdorfer reveals 
the life of a man who spent much of 
his time trying to stay away from the 
limelight. Oberdorfer describes the 
Senator’s many accomplishments 
while he was a member of our 
nation’s Upper House — including 
the successful passage of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and other Great 
Society programs, as well as a 
continuous objection to military 
escalation in Vietnam, advice that 
President Johnson unfortunately 
did not heed. Being a Democrat 

or a Republican was much more 
of a nominal title back then, and 
Mansfield consistently stayed above 
party politics and led, for the most 
part, a very apolitical career.

Legislative achievements aside, 

Mansfield may be most remembered 
for his remarkable persona. When 
President John F. Kennedy was 
assassinated in 1963, Jacqueline 
Kennedy, the president’s widow, 
asked that Mansfield give a eulogy 
while the president lay in state at 
the Capitol. There was a reason 
Mansfield led the Senate through 
five 
different 
presidencies 
and 

served as ambassador to Japan — 
a job that is typically reserved for 
political benefactors — even after 
Ronald Reagan took office from 
Jimmy Carter in 1981.

It could have been his humble 

beginnings: a boy from New York 
City raised in Montana by a distant 
aunt and uncle, only to run away at 
an early age and subsequently live 
in an orphanage for over a year. He 
worked as a coal miner without a 
high-school degree for almost a 
decade. His future wife, Maureen, 
convinced him to work his way 
toward a bachelor’s degree, and 
he went on to get his master’s and 
teach at the University of Montana.

A few years ago, James Grady 

wrote 
a 
wonderful 
piece 
on 

Mansfield in Politics Daily. In it, 
Grady recalls an episode in which 
Mansfield “Caught a Democratic 
colleague 
breaking 
a 
promise 

to a Republican, (so) Mike used 
the rules of the Senate to give 
the Republican his promised fair 
shot.” There was little pettiness 
in the Mansfield Senate, very 
small-scale 
bitterness 
and 

hostility among its members; Mike 
regularly reminded his colleagues 
to, as Grady puts it, “Act like they 
belonged to ‘the world’s greatest 

deliberative body.’ ” During the 
Watergate 
scandal, 
Mansfield 

made sure to make a non-partisan 
investigative committee to oversee 
the 
hearings, 
something 
that 

secured 
constitutional 
integrity 

throughout the process to remove 
a corrupt politician from the 
 

White House.

Mansfield once said, “When I’m 

gone, I want to be forgotten.” This 
kind of modesty, statesmanship and 
respect for everyone surrounding 
him makes Mansfield a politician of 
his own kind, from a different era. 
Today, seldom do you see a member 
of government deliberately try to 
avoid taking credit, solely focusing 
on bettering the people of the state 
of Montana and the country that he 
fought for and loved.

I wish I could truly express the 

excellence that embodied the life 
of Mansfield; however, I believe the 
best way to do that is to review his 
life, and realize that he was truly 
one of the greatest leaders to ever 
set foot in Washington, D.C.

He is now buried in Arlington 

National Cemetery, in the same 
simple gravestone that marks the 
thousands of soldiers lying with 
him, still keeping watch over our 
nation and its lawmakers.

I hope that those who work 

in our government, and those 
who aspire to one day be in our 
government, take notice of the 
lessons taught to us by Mansfield. 
The state of American politics is in 
fragile condition, constantly being 
tested by the extreme partisanship 
of our country’s leadership. Let us 
hope that the words and wisdom of 
Michael Mansfield can once again 
be realized, especially by the ones 
who walk in his footsteps.

Ben Keller is an LSA freshman 

and Editorial Board member. 

T 

rayvon Martin was killed 
during my first semester 
in college. I remember 

sitting in my civil 
rights 
history 

class, where our 
professor 
asked 

if any of us had 
heard the name. 
I knew the loose 
facts of the story, 
but it was still 
a 
little 
while 

before 
George 

Zimmerman 
became 
an 

anathema 
and 

hoodies a symbol of solidarity.

Three years later, I ran into that 

same professor at a small gather-
ing of students and faculty. I hadn’t 
seen him in some time, but the event 
was tragically fitting. Along with 
others, he had helped organize a 
space for us to watch the announce-
ment from Ferguson about Darren 
Wilson’s indictment.

After we listened to the decision, 

everyone sat quietly to observe 
a moment of silence for Michael 
Brown. The only sounds came from 
a woman in the front of the room, 
who was crying. As four and a half 
minutes passed, a professor asked 
if anyone had thoughts or reactions 
to share. Between tears, the crying 
woman asked, “When are our lives 
going to matter?”

During my time in college, it 

has often been hard to believe life 
is genuinely improving for Black 
Americans. Between the deaths of 
Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown, 
there have been countless Black 
people killed by police and vigi-
lantes: Renisha McBride, Jordan 
Davis, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and 
more. The milestone of the nation’s 
first Black president has, in some 
ways, been overshadowed, and not 
just by the frequent destruction 
of innocent Black life. The Voting 
Rights Act has been gutted, state-
level bans on affirmative action 
have been upheld and it is likely 
that the Fair Housing Act is on the 
chopping block next.

And 
this 
is 
just 
the 
past 
 

three years.

It is very easy to look at American 

history — especially as it is pre-
sented in schools — and see a clear 
progression toward racial equality. 
The end of slavery was followed by 
the end of segregation, which led to 
expanded voting rights, which was 
followed by the nation’s first Black 
president, etc., etc. The improved 
state of Black Americans from 
chattel slavery to explicit protec-
tion in the Constitution is undeni-
able, but a deeper understanding 
of the history 
and 
structural 

flaws of educa-
tion, 
criminal 

justice, 
voting 

and other insti-
tutions 
muddy 

the waters.

Neighbor-

hoods 
and 

schools 
across 

the country are 
overwhelmingly 
segregated by race, with “Black” 
schools 
finding 
synonymy 
with 

“poor” or “violent” schools. Prisons, 
from local holding cells to federal 
penitentiaries to death row, are dis-
proportionately filled with Black and 
brown bodies. Inequity in the educa-
tion and criminal justice systems is 
nothing new when it comes to race 
in America, but these discrepancies 
are not necessarily stagnant. It could 
be argued that, if current trends con-
tinue, the average Black child born 
today will face worse discrimination 
than his or her parents.

Perhaps this gloomy outlook is a 

bit cynical, even fatalistic. But as a 
realist, I don’t find it unreasonable 
to fear that our generation may hit 
a brick wall when it comes to racial 
progress. I don’t say this to be a 
provocateur or a contrarian, but to 
reflect the urgency of crisis and the 
necessity for action.

At the very least, we must accept 

that a perpetually unequal soci-
ety is possible; in December 2013, 
however, the Black Student Union 
decided it would not be inevitable.

During a time when college stu-

dents are criticized for “slacktiv-
ism” and general political apathy, 
the BSU has been able to convert 
national media attention into con-
crete progress. A new multicultural 

center is on its way, and the Uni-
versity has been pushed harder for 
increased diversity than it has in 
years. Though many of the experi-
ences discussed through #BBUM 
reflected a campus unwelcoming 
to Black students, perhaps most 
importantly — though less con-
crete — there has been a noticeable 
change on campus when it comes to 
discussions of race.

Similarly, the killing of Michael 

Brown 
and 

attacks on pro-
testers in Fer-
guson 
should 

not purely be 
seen for their 
horrors. 
The 

day after pros-
ecutors 
chose 

not 
to 
indict 

Darren Wilson, 
hundreds of stu-
dents and com-

munity members gathered on the 
Diag for a vigil. After a few short 
speeches, local activists moved the 
gathering into a planned march. 
Leaving the Diag, more than 1,000 
people filled Ann Arbor’s streets, 
bringing downtown traffic to a 
halt. Massive anti-racism demon-
strations like these have broken 
out across the country, and paral-
lels with tipping points during the 
1950s and 1960s are hard to ignore.

During college, there has been 

no issue that I have studied or writ-
ten about more than racism. It’s a 
poetic note that my undergraduate 
years began with the senseless mur-
der of a Black 16-year-old and will 
conclude with the nation declaring 
“Black Lives Matter.” However, no 
matter the neat symmetry of my 
experiences, this isn’t poetry. This 
is the future of civil rights and civil 
liberties; this is the destiny of an 
entire people, both as a collective 
and as millions of individuals. This 
is a turning point.

In explaining why he came that 

day to a community dialogue on 
Ferguson, a Black graduate student 
fought back tears as he told us:

“This is my life on the line.”

Kendrick’s new 
album surprises

Lamar’s ‘To 

Pimp a Butterfly’ 

is mandatory 

listening

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

All of us have voices in our 

heads that tell us we’re not good 
enough. They feed into our inse-
curities, 
say-

ing we’re not 
strong enough, 
smart enough, 
talented 
enough, 
rich 

enough, deter-
mined enough, 
sane 
enough 

to be success-
ful, to do what 
we need to do. 
Kendrick Lamar hears these 
voices, too — probably much 
louder than most of us. But these 
voices don’t stop Lamar. Instead, 
they’ve fueled him, providing 
the unrelenting engine that has 
created To Pimp a Butterfly, an 
album that will never be forgot-
ten by anyone who listens to it.

You could compare To Pimp 

a Butterfly to other anti-fame 
albums, ones that express the 
dangers of celebrity. You could 
compare it to other records that 
seem to capture mental break-
downs on tape. You could even 
compare it to other trippy, para-
noid masterpieces that have 
been produced in studios. But 
you won’t, because while there’s 
other music that tries to capture 
some of To Pimp a Butterfly’s 
essence, Kendrick Lamar’s lat-
est work is so strong and singu-
lar, grabbing you by the collar 
and dragging you into its world 
from the opening seconds, that 
your mind won’t be able to focus 
on anything except what Lamar 
wants you to hear.

The trajectory of the album 

can be summarized by a poem 
repeated and expanded upon by 
Lamar throughout the tracklist. 
Lamar’s self-doubt and conflict 
leaves him “screaming in the 
hotel room,” surrounded by evil. 
So he goes home (to Compton? 
To Africa? To his true inner self? 
All are possible interpretations). 
“But that didn’t stop the survi-
vor’s guilt,” Lamar says, so he 
realizes he needs to teach oth-
ers about his message of respect, 
unity and love.

The biggest reveal of To Pimp a 

Butterfly is just how deep Lamar’s 
post-fame 
depressive 
spiral 

was. Opener “Wesley’s Theory” 
recalls Kendrick’s early dreams 
of hitting it big and reminds him 
that the rise is the easy part — it’s 
staying on top that’ll stress you 
to the point of insanity. Next, 
on “For Free?” Lamar is berated 
by women who attack his inse-
curities over a classic jazz beat. 
Additionally, “u” simulates a 
true breakdown in a hotel room, 
as Lamar hears a drunk former 
friend from his neighborhood 
tear him to shreds for abandon-
ing where he came from. Lamar 
raps these verses with theat-
rical pathos that he’s brought 
before on songs like “Sing About 
Me,” and these tracks are just 
as intense. But Lamar saves his 
sharpest barbs for celebrity, 
record companies and the cul-
ture of fame. The album’s char-
acter of Lucy (possibly short for 
Lucifer?) tempts Lamar on “For 
Sale?” Lucy promises to move 
Lamar’s mother out of Comp-
ton and into a mansion — all she 
wants in return is trust, loyalty 
and a signed contract.

Considering 
how 
wide 
in 

scope the album is, it’s incredible 
that the songs of To Pimp a But-
terfly are somehow even more 
cohesive than the songs of the 
good kid, m.A.A.d city. good kids’s 
subtitle, “A Short Film by Kend-
rick Lamar,” was well-deserved 
— when you closed your eyes, you 
really could see Compton — but 
the singularity of Lamar’s cre-
ative vision is even more mature 
and more intense on this latest 
release. Every song plays a very 
specific role in the overall state-
ment that To Pimp a Butterfly’s 
narrative makes. While on its 

own, “The Blacker the Berry” 
may have sounded like a com-
plete indictment of the streets 
Lamar comes from, in context, 
it’s presented as one of many 
aspects of the Black experience. 
Lamar sweats blood through 
his verses, alternating between 
proud and self-hating as he spits 
lyrics so deep that even Michael 
Chabon could only scratch the 
surface when he annotated them 
for Genius.

Lamar fans who got angry and 

disappointed every time dozens 
of drunk people sung along to 
“Swimming Pools” at house par-
ties, have no fear: While To Pimp 
a Butterfly is far too dense and 
layered for every part of Lamar’s 
message to be immediately and 
completely understood, there’s 
no way that any of these tracks 
will be mistaken for commercial 
turn-up party anthems. Lamar 
unequivocally eschews anything 
that would even remotely sound 
like a Mike Will Made It or DJ 
Mustard joint, even messing 
with previous single “i” enough 
that none of these songs will be 
played on the radio. Instead, he 
brings in artists like Thundercat 
and Terrace Martin, who ground 
the disorienting trippiness of 
songs like “Wesley’s Theory” 
and “King Kunta” with strong 
bass, jazz instruments and afro-
centric beats. The only credited 
A-list cameo comes from Snoop 
Dogg on “Institutionalized,” but 
even he is raspy, nearly unrec-
ognizable and gone in a flash of 
smoke. In fact, there’s not even a 
Black Hippy member to be found 
— a very noticeable omission that 
doesn’t bode well for the future 
of rap’s best collective. The most 
non-Lamar bars actually go to 
the little-known Rapsody, who 
delivers a verse of pride and love 
on “Complexion.”

Lamar’s music touches on sub-

jects including racial identity, the 
plight of inmates, Black beauty, 
the trials of fame, gang violence, 
police brutality, personal depres-
sion, the need for love and unity 
among all races and many more. 
Lamar spends To Pimp a Butter-
fly’s 80 minutes sharing almost 
all of his thoughts, and what he 
has to say is fascinating, a little 
schizophrenic 
and 
scattered, 

and incredibly smart. The com-
bination of the sheer power of 
Lamar’s rapping with the hyp-
notic jazz fusion production 
makes it impossible to tear your-
self away from the record and 
commands an endless number 
of listens. Lamar’s talent makes 
it feel like you’re pulled entirely 
into his own separate world, but 
everything his says has relevance 
in our own.

The most perfect, beautiful 

moment on To Pimp a Butterfly 
comes on “i.” After the confusion, 
anger and heavy, heavy darkness 
of the first 14 tracks, we hear the 
familiar voice of the same pastor 
who began this track when it was 
released six months ago. Except 
on that old release, the pastor 
said “He’s not a rapper; he’s a 
writer!” On this proper album 
track, he introduces Lamar as 
“the number-one rapper in the 
world.” It’s hard to understate 
exactly how important that dif-
ference is. For a while, it seemed 
like Kendrick Lamar was maybe 
too good for hip hop, preferring 
to be talked of in the company of 
dead white guys instead of 2Pac, 
Nas or Kanye. But that change, 
coupled with the faux-live set-
ting that places Lamar right in 

the heart of his neighborhood 
and disarms any accusations of 
selling out for radio play, con-
firms the emergence of Lamar’s 
true inner self, the Lamar we’ve 
been waiting the whole record 
to hear. “i” ’s catharsis of self-
acceptance, of putting the gun 
down and embracing love, cre-
ates a truly glorious moment.

However, as the song goes on, 

Lamar’s audience doesn’t nec-
essarily accept his message of 
love with open ears, and Lamar 
doesn’t exactly take their mixed 
reaction kindly. The unified 
clarity of the album doesn’t last 
long. An argument breaks out 
between fans, and Lamar stops 
the music, admonishing his 
crowd to “save that shit for the 
streets” and proceeding to deliv-
er an a capella lecture/verse on 
the word “Negus.” On To Pimp a 
Butterfly we hear a certain kind 
of militancy in Kendrick Lamar 
— not militancy in the tradition-
al Black Panther sense, but an 
indestructible conviction in his 
message that refuses to allow 
dissent.

12 years ago, Jay-Z released 

his “final” album, titled The 
Black Album. If Hov hadn’t taken 
that name, it would’ve been an 
appropriate descriptor for To 
Pimp a Butterfly, a release that 
overflows with knowledge of 
Black history, attempts to cover 
as many parts of the Black 
American experience as it can 
and name-checks everyone from 
Moses to the Black Panthers to 
Malcolm X, MLK, Nelson Man-
dela and 2Pac. Nowhere is this 
more apparent than the album’s 
closer, “Mortal Man.” 12 min-
utes long and dedicated to Nel-
son Mandela, “Mortal Man” ’s 
verses deal with Lamar’s fear 
of being abandoned by his fans. 
“When the shit hit the fan, is you 
still a fan?” he asks. The actions-
speak-louder-than-words mes-
sage and the line “How many 
leaders you said you needed then 
left ’em for dead?” ring true, but 
Lamar might be a little too para-
noid about the public’s potential 
betrayal. Of Michael Jackson, he 
says, “That nigga gave us Billie 
Jean, you say he touched those 
kids?” Hm.

“Mortal Man” ’s lengthy outro 

that closes To Pimp a Butterfly is 
a conversation between Lamar 
and 2Pac, who’s recreated from 
old interview tapes. They dis-
cuss the future of Lamar’s gen-
eration, and Lamar explains a 
metaphor that “a good friend” 
wrote describing Lamar’s world. 
In the metaphor, which gives the 
album its title, there are enlight-
ened “butterflies” and bitter 
“caterpillars” who are trapped 
in cocoons of their own envi-
ronments and try to “pimp” the 
butterflies. The mission of the 
butterfly, Kendrick says, is to 
shed light on the caterpillars in 
order to end the “eternal strug-
gle.” “What’s your perspective 
on that?” Lamar asks 2Pac. Pac 
doesn’t answer, and thus ends 
To Pimp a Butterfly. After taking 
in the whole album, you may be 
ready to follow Lamar to the ends 
of the earth, or you may dismiss 
him as an overdramatic egotist, 
but one thing is indisputable: To 
Pimp a Butterfly is mandatory lis-
tening from a rapper whose trials, 
tribulations and immeasurable 
ambition have helped create a 
once-in-a-lifetime record, one 
whose words, if their creator 
achieves his goal, will inspire and 
endure for generations.

‘Cinderella’ dazzles

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

It’s hard to justify a live-action 

remake of an animated movie 
like 1950’s “Cinderella” — a movie 
that 
doesn’t 

particularly 
need 
to 
be 

retold despite 
its 
abundant 

number 
of 

adaptations. 
To remake a 
film like “Cin-
derella,” 
one 

would expect 
the 
filmmak-

ers 
to 
take 

a 
different 

approach, perhaps shifting the 
viewpoint to that of Anastasia, 
one of the evil stepsisters, or 
presenting the story in a histori-
cal setting with a feminist per-
spective, as 1998’s “Ever After” 
did. Ironically, though, 2015’s 
“Cinderella” succeeds so well 
precisely for the opposite reason. 
Instead of nixing the fantastical 
elements, the fantasy is piled on, 
and the film is a vivid and color-
ful live-action remake instead of 
a dark or gritty interpretation.

Ella (Lily James, “Downton 

Abbey”) finds herself in the care 
of a wicked stepmother (Cate 
Blanchett, “Blue Jasmine”) and 
two cruel stepsisters, Anastasia 
and Drizella (Holliday Grainger, 
“The 
Borgias” 
and 
Sophia 

McShera, “Galavant,” respec-
tively) after both of her parents 
pass away. Here’s where the story 
changes a little: Rather than 
meeting Prince Charming for the 
first time at his lavish ball, Ella 
meets him during an afternoon 

of horseback riding in the forest, 
and he misleadingly introduces 
himself as Kit (Richard Madden, 
“Game of Thrones”), an appren-
tice who works at the castle.

This change benefits the logic 

of the story, for the most part. 
When Kit goes home and finally 
does throw the ball, he opens 
it to all eligible maidens for the 
purpose of finding Ella. The film 
rarely attempts to inject femi-
nism into a story that naturally 
denies its female protagonist her 
agency, but putting Ella and Kit 
on more equal footing aids the 
storytelling and makes their love 
more credible. With Kenneth 
Branagh’s (“Jack Ryan: Shadow 
Recruit”) direction, the camera 
makes circular pans around Ella 
and Kit, drawing a natural paral-
lel between their horses circling 
around each other as they meet 
in the forest and their later diz-
zying dance scene. There’s noth-
ing complex, exactly, about their 
love, but there rarely is in a fairy 
tale.

The film puts other slight spins 

on the original. In the hands of a 
gloriously unlikable Blanchett, 
Lady Tremaine is both enter-
taining and a little more tragic 
than the 1950 stepmother; Chris 
Weitz’s (“The Golden Compass”) 
script insinuates that Tremaine’s 
resentment for Ella is born out of 
grief and a deep-seated jealousy 
of Ella’s late mother, whose place 
Lady Tremaine will never be able 
to fill. When a man arrives to tell 
the family of Ella’s father’s death, 
he says to Ella, “He spoke only of 
you and your mother.” The pain 
on Lady Tremaine’s face in that 
one shot signals the beginning of 
the disdain Ella will face in her 

stepmother’s servitude.

The film is also occasionally 

quite funny, especially when 
Helena Bonham Carter (“Les 
Misérables”) appears as the Fairy 
Godmother who revitalizes the 
film with a self-aware spin on the 
character, turning a passing liz-
ard and goose into the footman 
and coachman of Ella’s pumpkin 
carriage. The coachman, with a 
nose resembling a goose’s beak, 
says, “I can’t drive; I’m a goose,” 
and though it’s silly, the coach-
man’s perplexed delivery earns 
laughs.

The willingness to indulge 

the fantastical aspects of Cin-
derella’s story is also its great-
est flaw. The film’s existence in 
the first place is a little hard to 
justify, since it stays so close to 
the 1950 version, hardly giving 
Ella any complexity beyond the 
obvious emotions: sadness at 
her parents’ passing and happi-
ness when she’s with the prince. 
When the film does try to go 
more complex, elaborating on 
Ella’s embarrassment at her 
lack of noble standing, it falters 
a little, especially because this 
film’s Prince Charming never 
cares even slightly about wheth-
er or not the love of his life is a 
princess. The main conflict feels 
forced as a result.

Thankfully, though, the pres-

ervation of the original film’s 
sense of adventure overrides any 
major flaw “Cinderella” might 
have. Always fun and featuring 
a dazzling array of bright colors 
and costumes, the movie might 
not deliver a daring new take on 
the original story, but its tradi-
tional nature is what makes the 
film so appealing.

FILM REVIEW
‘Red Army’ elevates 
sports documentary

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

Early on in “The Red Army,” 

Viacheslav 
Fetisov, 
the 
leg-

endary defenseman of the Red 
Army 
ice 

hockey 
club 

and 
star 
of 

the documen-
tary, 
refuses 

to 
cooperate 

with 
Gabe 

Polsky 
(“The 

Motel 
Life”), 

the documen-
tarian. 
Wry 

smile on his 
lips, he checks his phone, mak-
ing a crack about American 
work ethic, as Polsky — unable 
to restrain himself — pelts him 
with questions. The comedic 
dance between director and star 
is just one facet of humor in “The 
Red Army,” Polsky’s film about 
the iconic Russian hockey team 
and its Soviet-era backdrop. It’s 
funnier than you would expect: 
kids sing propaganda songs, on-
screen lyrics marked by a bounc-
ing hammer-and-sickle, Fetisov 
slings jabs at Polsky, a dictatorial 
coach’s habit of hitting his play-
ers draws audience laughs. Yet 
for its levity and flashy graph-
ics, “The Red Army” still wields 
a hefty thematic load as it 
explores the politics that played 
out on ice, as well as the aesthet-
ics of an aggressive, beautiful 
sport. 

Cultural 
critic 
Roland 

Barthes wrote in “The World 
of Wrestling” that in the U.S., 
“wrestling represents a kind of 
mythological combat between 
Good and Evil … the ‘bad wres-
tler’ always presumed to be a 
Red.” This maxim latches eas-
ily onto ice hockey, especially 
during the monumental 1980 
Winter Olympics when Ameri-
can “underdogs” (as if the U.S. 
could ever be the humble long 
shot) defeated the Soviet Union 
in Lake Placid, New York. Amid 
Russia’s 
recent 
invasion 
of 

Afghanistan and plunged deep 
in the Cold War, both media and 
President Jimmy Carter took 
every advantage to situate the 
game within ideological signifi-
cance as athletes were blown 

into symbolic manifestations of 
Communism versus Capitalism. 
For the U.S., this grand narra-
tive spawned “Miracles on Ice,” 
but for the Russians, it was a 
frustrating — yet small — battle 
lost. 

Up until 1972, the beloved 

coach Anatoli Tarasov led the 
team, which is where “Red 
Army” elevates a sports docu-
mentary into a sophisticated 
look at the art underlying the 
game. Tarasov’s brand of coach-
ing drew inspiration from mae-
stros of ballet and chess alike 
to create the complex plays 
that defined the team’s tech-
nical prowess. The film deftly 
characterizes what makes Rus-
sian hockey so distinct from its 
clunky rivals’ type of play — that 
is, the team’s point of intersec-
tion between individual talent 
and collaborative, spontaneous 
creativity. At times it appears 
like the team shares one hyper-
active brain, especially as they 
weave labyrinthine and grace-
ful passes up and down the rink, 
gliding as quickly as synapses 
firing off, leaving opponents stu-
pefied.

The test point for a documenta-

ry is its ability to draw the viewer 
into its niche universe, to assimi-
late them into its rhythms of local 
culture. “Red Army” achieves this 
and more, by not only exploring the 
close-knit dynamics of the team, 
but by tracking the interposition of 
world politics on a group of talent-
ed players who just want to, well, 
play hockey. After the spectacular 
failure of the Olympics that played 
out on the global media stage, 
the Soviet Union immediately 
regrouped their patriotic sport par 
example by radically restructur-
ing: a swath of longstanding mem-

bers are out, and Viktor Tikhonov, 
Tarasov’s 
successor, 
doubles 

down. Intractably embedded in 
politics, the Red Army Team was 
actually an official part of the Sovi-
et Army during the era and Tik-
honov plays the general with the 
full brunt of his government-sanc-
tioned authority. Training length-
ens and intensifies, and the idyllic 
relations between the team start 
to crumble. “Red Army” draws its 
narrative work from interviews 
with the core team members who 
don’t hold back in their criticism of 
Tikhonov, a figure who encapsu-
lates the worst impulses of his gov-
ernment. Isolated for 11 months 
of the year and treated with little 
compassion (a teammate recalls 
not being allowed to visit his dying 
father) the team culls viewer sym-
pathy easily. Intriguingly though, 
the film doesn’t shy away from the 
logistical success of Tikhonov’s 
tactics — a slew of wins follow. 
While never becoming an allegory, 
“Red Army” elegantly aligns these 
tailing years of the Soviet Union 
with the team’s own declining 
morale, as team members ulti-
mately defect to U.S. teams with 
much resistance from their own 
government.

Through its final leg, “Red 

Army” explores questions of 
national identity. Far from being 
opponents of Russia, the players 
retain a complicated solidarity 
with not just their country, but 
with the state they were shaped 
by. Even as 1991’s failed coup 
brings a wave of economic free-
dom, this post-Union period is 
marked by lawlessness and cor-
ruption, which Fetisov and his 
teammates 
mourn. 
Similarly, 

the team’s various moves to the 
U.S. are portrayed with vex, but 
“Red Army” still finds a quietly 
triumphant ending, as five mem-
bers reunite in Detroit’s own Red 
Wings team, bringing their elabo-
rate style of hockey to Ameri-
can ice. For the sheer breadth of 
thematic ground “Red Army” 
moves through, its run time of 
76 minutes could have felt slight. 
Yet just as its subject springs to 
life through feats of astonish-
ing choreography, “Red Army,” 
too, displays remarkable talent in 
spinning its far-flung narrative 
threads together.

‘Stars’ for a cause

Comedy Central 

charity event raises 

awareness for 

autism

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

In a room packed with enter-

tainers who tell jokes for a living, 
it’s sometimes hard to see the big-
ger 
purpose. 

The fact is that 
people laugh at 
misfortune 
— 

comedians make 
light of atrocities 
such as Ebola 
virus or dictator 
Kim Jong Un. 
When not joking 
about 
deathly 

serious matters, 
they impersonate the most glam-
orous and ridiculous of Hollywood 
— stars like Kim Kardashian (who, 
coincidentally, tops Kim Jong Un in 
a Google search of her first name). 

With a parody platform that 

alternates between topics too ter-
rible to believe and celebrities living 
unimaginable lives, a gaping space 
is left for reality. Few Americans 
(thankfully) are affected by North 
Korean politics and even fewer by 
Justin Bieber’s 21st birthday antics. 
What they are affected by are the 
unglorified challenges in life: For 
one in every 68 children and their 
parents, this means living with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 
Laughing at tragedy and mockery 
may allow a person to escape the 
moment, but is that all comedy can 
do?

The folks at New York Collabo-

rates for Autism (NYCA) didn’t 

think so. With its motto, “NYCA 
sees the possibility and creates the 
path,” the non-profit organization 
strives to dramatically improve 
the lives of people living with ASD 
through 
innovative 
programs, 

helped by partner charities and col-
laborations. 

“Night of Too Many Stars” 

was the brainchild of a collabora-
tion with Comedy Central, air-
ing first in 2006 as a marathon 
broadcast flooded with A-list 
comedians and performers. This 
year’s lineup included Steve Carell 
(“The Office”), Paul Rudd (“Parks 
and Recreation”), Maya Rudolph 
(“Bridesmaids”), 
Chris 
Rock 

(“Everybody Hates Chris”) and 
Adam Sandler (“Happy Gilmore”) 
to name a few, all raising awareness 
and funds for NYCA. 

Hosted by Jon Stewart (“The 

Daily Show”), the 2006, 2012 and 
2015 shows have collected well 
over $18 million for NYCA through 
ticket sales for the live show in New 
York City’s Beacon Theatre, online 
donations and (perhaps the best 
way) miscellaneous celebrity auc-
tions. Currently on Comedy Cen-
tral’s website, bidders can enter to 
win the chance to be drawn into an 
episode of “The Simpsons,” or bid 
on a gold rotary phone signed by 
“Call Me Maybe” babe Carly Rae 
Jepsen ($230 current bid) and a 
“World’s Best Boss” mug signed by 
Steve Carell ($750 current bid). And 
unlike throwing down hundreds 
of dollars for a birthday candle 
blown out by J-Biebs, the money is 
going towards an excellent cause — 
allowing hundreds of people diag-
nosed with ASD access to proper 
education and the attention neces-
sary to live a happy, fulfilling life. 

If the online auctions are fun, the 

live auction on the show was even 
better. Between watching stand-up 

acts like Amy Schumer’s fantastic 
riff on being a “real” woman in Hol-
lywood, audience members could 
buy an endorsement from Chris 
Rock (won by designer Tommy 
Hilfiger for $35,000) or the chance 
to “commit a crime” with British 
comedian John Oliver.

Good humor and grand dona-

tions aside, the best part of “Night 
of Too Many Stars” was when the 
real purpose took the spotlight. 
Owen Suskind, a teenager with 
ASD, had grown up reenacting 
scenes from Disney’s “Aladdin” 
with his father as a way to commu-
nicate. He would play Jafar while 
his father acted as Iago, the parrot 
who’s voiced by Gilbert Gottfried 
(“The Celebrity Apprentice”). In 
the most heartwarming appear-
ance in the show (surprising even 
Jon Stewart), Gottfried brought 
Suskind onto the stage to reenact an 
“Aladdin” scene with the real Iago. 
Though Gottfried forgot his lines 
— “Ah fuck, it was 20 years ago!” 
— Suskind filled in for both parts, 
his megawatt smile outshining the 
celebrities on stage. 

Though we seek comedy to for-

get the seriousness of life, moments 
like these remind us that our basic 
routines — like pretending to be 
Disney characters — are the most 
powerful, because they make us 
who we are. “Night of Too Many 
Stars” is unique because though it 
has a stacked roster of celebrities, 
the stage is given to the real all-
stars in our lives.

TV REVIEW
FILM REVIEW
‘Timbuktu’ unnerves

By ZAK WITUS

Daily Arts Writer

“Timbuktu” transports us. 

Not simply in the sense of trans-
porting us through space and 
time, as any film does, but in 
the sense of 
transport-
ing us into a 
foreign 
con-

sciousness. To 
tell its story, 
“Timbuktu” 
intervenes 
in 
the 
nor-

mal flow of 
Western con-
sciousness. 
This 
begins 

with simple changes of scenery 
(vast and mostly empty desert 
backdrops, black and silent des-
ert nights, sand-colored cities, 
humans with brown skin liv-
ing in tents, etc.) and ends with 
changes in our cultural and ide-
ological filters through which 
we experience life. Whether 
and to what degree these deep-
er changes endure after the film 
has ended is up to you.

“Timbuktu” stations view-

ers in the highly volatile city 
of Timbuktu, Mali, located 
in northwestern Africa. The 
infamous black flag that most 
Americans will associate with 
the Islamic State appears in the 
first few minutes of the film. 
Interestingly, the characters 
never call this ruling band of 
Islamic jihadists by that name 
or any of its variations (IS, ISIS 
or, Obama’s preference, ISIL). 
That’s because the militant 
jihadists occupying Timbuktu 
in this film are not in fact ISIS, 
but Ansar Dine. To many Amer-
icans the difference may appear 
negligible – these Islamic fun-

damentalist militants are still 
killing people for seemingly 
ridiculous reasons, like playing 
music or smoking cigarettes. 
But American audiences cannot 
avoid noticing that these mili-
tants’ victims are not Ameri-
cans, but Africans. (Indeed, 
the United States is never men-
tioned in the film.)

The film’s slow pace builds 

tension 
gradually, 
accenting 

key moments of action and vio-
lence (similar, in this regard, 
to “Foxcatcher,” and the polar 
opposite of the “Fast and Furi-
ous” series). The strict economy 
of dialogue and the effective 
use of silence may irk (and 
perhaps intrigue) those of us 
accustomed to rapid-fire con-
versation, either in our personal 
lives or in film. As it turns out, 
everything need not always be 
communicated 
so 
explicitly 

or done so obviously. Indeed, 
“Timbuktu” demonstrates great 
reservation in dialogue, and yet 
the precise diction along with 
choice of shots and other non-
verbal elements develops into 
a language that communicates 
more than the most verbose 
Hollywood motion picture.

One might think that the 

stark 
cultural 
differences 

between us (e.g., Westerners) 
and them (e.g., the characters 
in “Timbuktu” and the people 
they represent) would over-
whelm us to the point of not 
understanding basic aspects of 
the drama. Not so. The weight 
of the drama hangs heavy on 
us all the more. Though we 
may not fully agree with, say, 
Kidane’s 
retaliation 
against 

the fisherman who slayed his 
cow, if we allow ourselves to 
be cinematically immersed in 
this other world and its people’s 
way of life, we can understand 

the causes and motives of his 
action. “Humiliation” is the key 
word here, as elsewhere in this 
film, to describe the enduring, 
underlying cause that moves 
the people toward desperation 
and then toward evil. But I don’t 
wish to mislead: You won’t be 
spoon fed any easy moral truths 
in “Timbuktu.” If you’re looking 
for that, I hear pirated copies 
of “American Sniper” are now 
available. 

Where “American Sniper” 

failed, “Timbuktu” succeeds: 
The film invites us to empa-
thize 
with 
its 
characters, 

including the Muslims. It does 
not invite empathy with the 
so-called “terrorists,” although 
there’s certainly room for that; 
rather that is to invite us to 
empathize with the ordinary 
folk, like the poor fisherman, 
the orphan shepherd boy or the 
odd-but-wise rooster lady. By 
empathizing with these char-
acters, we extend our minds 
across the artificial boundaries 
set between ourselves (e.g., the 
U.S.) and other peoples, and we 
recognize that “they” are fun-
damentally just like “us.”

“Timbuktu” doesn’t let one 

drop of blood go unnoticed: 
It’s almost as if the filmmakers 
are crazy enough to believe that 
human blood is sacred! (an idea 
for which Hollywood war mov-
ies rarely have regard). Instead 
of Call of Duty-style shootouts 
killing faceless, soulless non-
entities, “Timbuktu” makes you 
realize that when you kill your 
enemy, an actual person dies. 
This highly sensitive treatment 
of human life might challenge 
our 
gun-slinging, 
American 

cowboy sensibilities, but it’s 
worth experiencing if for no 
other reason than to appreciate 
the contrast.

STYLE RECAP
New Miu Miu 
collection

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

Since its founding in 1993, 

Miu Miu has been intellectual-
turned-fashion-mogul 
Miuccia 

Prada’s outlet for her playful, girl-
ish side. The brand prides itself 
on being a cheekier version of its 
older, more sophisticated parent 
brand, Prada, and often does so in 
a bold, whimsical fashion. For its 
fall ready-to-wear line for Paris 
Fashion Week, Miu Miu show-
cased its strengths — opting for 
a collection consisting of vibrant 
colors, conspicuous prints, bold 
statement jewelry and its signa-
ture over-the-top footwear. 

While a vast majority of fashion 

houses showcased ’70s inspired 
collections, Miu Miu wasn’t overtly 
subject to a specific decade, though 
it did feature the era’s exaggerated 
blouses and generous amounts of 
gingham. Pastoral button-downs 
mimicked 
19th-century 
fash-

ion, A-line dresses channeled the 
mod ’60s and metallic outerwear 

added a futuristic flair. If anything, 
the show exuded mainly ’80s 
vibes with chunky jewelry and 
a soundtrack fresh out of a John 
Hughes film. Overall, the collec-
tion offered uber-feminine silhou-
ettes, with no pants in sight and 
figure flattering cinched waists. 

The show’s overarching theme 

seemed to be one of refined chaos, 
shying from any succinct mini-
malism and brimming with ener-
gy. The collection’s overzealous, 
youthful overtones extended to 
the accessories as well, featuring 
footwear in a Candyland-esque 
color scheme, accentuated with 
clunky heels and belts. Smaller 
handbags complete with braid-
ed handles also stood out. The 
quintessential quirkiness of Miu 
Miu defined the collection, as it 
included polished separates con-
trasted by avant-garde additions. 
Ultimately, a refreshing depar-
ture from common fall shades of 
jewel tones and greys, Miu Miu’s 
coquettish aesthetic is arguably 
PFW’s biggest standout.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, left, speaks during a news conference as St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar listens Sunday, March 15, 2015, in Clayton,

Williams declines 
to make statement 
during trial briefing 

CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) — The 

man accused of shooting two 
police officers last week in Fer-
guson appeared in court Mon-
day, a day after his arrest on 
charges that he fired on the men 
during a late-night protest.

Williams, 20, did not make any 

statements during the brief hear-
ing. St. Louis television station 
KTVI said a judge read the charg-
es — felony assault, armed crimi-
nal action and a weapons offense 
— and gave Williams a list of pos-
sible private attorneys. His next 
appearance was set for March 31.

Williams is accused of shooting 

the two officers Thursday outside 

Ferguson’s police station, which 
has been the scene of protests 
since last summer’s fatal shooting 
of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Williams told investigators he 

was not targeting law enforce-
ment and had been aiming instead 
at someone with whom he was in 
dispute, authorities said.

“We’re not sure we com-

pletely buy that part of it,” St. 
Louis County Prosecutor Robert 
McCulloch said.

Williams used a handgun that 

matches the shell casings at the 
scene, McCulloch said. He was 
being held on $300,000 bond.

Ferguson activist Derrick Rob-

inson said Sunday that Williams 
told him during a jail visit that he 
had been robbed earlier on the 
day of the shooting and returned 
to the protest zone to retaliate. 
On Monday, Robinson referred 

inquiries to Wiliams’ lawyer, who 
did not immediately respond to an 
interview request.

The shooting happened as 

a demonstration outside the 
police department began to 
break up. The protest followed 
the resignation of city Police 
Chief Tom Jackson in the wake 
of a Justice Department report 
that found widespread racial 
bias in the city’s police practices.

Protesters did not recognize 

Williams as one of their own, 
and he was not well known 
among neighbors.

Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest 

leader with the group Millen-
nial Activists United, said no 
one in her group knew Williams, 
and they checked with other 
frequent protesters, who also 
had not heard of him.

John Gaskin, a St. Louis 

NAACP leader, said of Williams, 
“I don’t know him. I’ve never 
seen him.”

On Monday, no one answered 

the door of the north St Louis 
County home Williams listed 
as his address on court records, 
and several neighbors said Mon-
day they did not know him. The 
home is about 5 miles northeast 
of the police department.

According to 2014 county 

court records, Williams lived in 
the nearby community of Jen-
nings, parts of which border 
Ferguson. But no one answered 
the door at that home either.

Online state court records 

show a man by the name of Jef-
frey Williams at the address 
police provided Sunday was 
charged in 2013 with receiving 
stolen property and fraudulent 
use of a credit/debit device.

New protocol 

aims to broaden 

participation 

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Seven-

teen years after Oregon decided 
to become the first state to hold 
all elections with mail-in ballots, 
it took another pioneering step 
on Monday to broaden participa-
tion by automatically registering 
people to vote.

Gov. Kate Brown signed a bill 

that puts the burden of registra-
tion on the state instead of voters.

Under the legislation, every 

adult citizen in Oregon who has 
interacted with the Driver and 
Motor Vehicle Services Division 
since 2013 but hasn’t registered 
to vote will receive a ballot in 
the mail at least 20 days before 
the next statewide election. The 
measure is expected to add about 
300,000 new voters to the rolls.

“It just changes expectations 

for who’s responsible for mak-
ing elections work,” said Barry 
Burden, a professor of political 
science at the University of Wis-
consin in Madison and director 
of the Elections Research Cen-
ter. “In every other state it’s the 
responsibility for the voters to 
make sure it happens.”

Some other states have consid-

ered such legislation but none has 

gone as far as Oregon.

Minnesota nearly implement-

ed automatic voter registration in 
2009 before the plan was vetoed 
by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who said 
“registering to vote should be a 
voluntary, intentional act.”

Similar concerns were raised 

by Oregon’s minority Republi-
cans.

“Simply because it makes us 

unique or makes us first does not 
necessarily mean that it actually 
improves on what we’re doing,” 
said state Sen. Jackie Winters, a 
Republican from Salem.

Oregon 
Republicans 
also 

voiced worry about potential 
voter fraud, the cost of imple-
menting the measure, and wheth-
er the DMV can ensure personal 
information remains secure.

Information the DMV has on 

file, such as age, residential infor-
mation, signature and citizenship 
status, will be transferred to the 
secretary of state, who will then 
automatically update registration 
information.

When it came up for a vote 

in the state Senate last week, all 
Republicans and one Democrat 
voted against it. The Democrats 
hold a 18-12 advantage in the Sen-
ate so the bill easily passed.

State Sen. Elizabeth Steiner 

Hayward, a Portland Democrat 
who carried the bill in the Senate, 
said there were rumblings the 

measure was a “secret plot” to 
enroll more Democrats. But she 
denied that was true.

Oregon already has one of the 

highest voter registration rates in 
the nation — 73 percent of Orego-
nians were registered to vote and 
70 percent of them cast ballots 
during the 2014 general election.

Tony Green, spokesman for 

the secretary of state, said the 
legislation is expected to even-
tually capture all unregistered 
voters who are in the DMV data-
base after taking actions such as 
obtaining or renewing a driver’s 
license.

Two years ago, when the mea-

sure was first proposed, Green 
said there were questions about 
whether the Driver and Motor 
Vehicle Services Division records 
were confidential under fed-
eral law. The legislative coun-
sel determined the secretary of 
state and the division could share 
information as long as it was for 
legitimate government purposes, 
he said.

People eligible to vote will get 

a postcard saying they’ve been 
registered and have three weeks 
to opt out. They’ll be automatical-
ly registered as unaffiliated but 
can select a political party from 
the postcard and return it to elec-
tion officials through the mail.

Automatic registration is not 

uncommon in other countries. 

Police reflect on 

moments leading to 

suspect’s arrest

BOSTON (AP) — Three police 

officers on Monday described an 
onslaught of gunfire and bombs 
thrown during a violent confron-
tation with the Boston Marathon 
bombers days after the deadly 
attack and one suspect’s furious 
escape in a stolen car that ended 
with him dragging his brother’s 
body through the street.

The testimony by Watertown 

officers came hours after jurors 
in the federal death penalty 
trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 
went to see the bullet-ridden 
boat he was found hiding in the 
evening of April 19, 2013.

Earlier that day, shortly after 

midnight, one officer spot-
ted a carjacked Mercedes SUV 
on a quiet residential street. 
That set off a frenzied clash in 
which Dzhokhar and his older 
brother, 
Tamerlan, 
hurled 

explosives at police, including 
two pipe bombs and one pres-
sure-cooker bomb similar to 
those used near the marathon 
finish line that killed 3 people 
and injured more than 260 oth-
ers, the officers testified.

Joseph Reynolds, the first 

officer at the scene, said he 
“locked eyes” with the SUV 
driver, who was later identified 
as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Reyn-
olds said Tamerlan got out of 
the car and began firing at him.

“All I could see was muzzle 

flashes,” he said. “I couldn’t 
count it. It was nonstop.”

The shots continued as other 

officers began to arrive, Reyn-
olds said.

He saw a wick and a lighter 

and then watched as an object 
flew through the air, landed 
in the street and exploded, he 
said, shaking him to his knees.

“I could feel all the debris 

landing on top of me,” he said.

Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese said he 

cut through backyards to get 
closer to the bombers, and he 
eventually could see their feet 
illuminated by car headlights. 
He said he aimed at the ground 
near their feet in the hope that 
the bullets would ricochet into 
their ankles.

But Tamerlan saw him and 

came charging up the street, 
firing at him, said Pugliese, 
who fired back.

The two men came face to 

face, with only 6 to 8 feet sepa-
rating them, Pugliese said. But 
Tamerlan had a problem with 
his pistol, the officer said.

“He kind of looked at his 

gun. He looked at me. We 
looked at each other,” Pugliese 
said. “I think out of frustra-
tion, he threw his gun at me.”

Pugliese 
said 
Tamerlan 

began to run away, but he tack-
led him. Tamerlan struggled 
as three officers tried to hand-
cuff him, even though he was 
wounded and bleeding, Pug-
liese said.

That’s when they saw the sto-

len car speeding toward them 
with 
Dzhokhar 
behind 
the 

wheel, Pugliese said.

The officer stepped out of the 

witness box to demonstrate how 
he tried to pull Tamerlan out of 
the way and how he rolled over to 
get himself out of the car’s path.

“The black SUV, it was right 

in my face,” he said. “I looked 
down, and I saw the front wheels 
were over Tamerlan.”

Marina and the Diamonds 
mines new depth in ‘Froot’

Pop musician 

balances 

bubblegum and 
meaning in latest 

album

By REGAN DETWILER

For The Daily

With the 

release 
of 

her 
third 

album, 
Froot, 
Welsh-born 
musician 
Marina and 
the 
Diamonds 

appears 
to 

have found 
her artistic 
center. Froot features bubblegum 
pop beats juxtaposed with lyr-
ics steeped in meaning, ranging 
from intimate personal reflec-
tion to dark social commentary. 

It’s impossible to take a good 

look at Froot without Marina’s 
previous two albums in mind. 
Marina first came into the spot-
light with her 2010 debut album 
The Family Jewels, which fell 
somewhere along the lines of 
electronic indie-pop, being remi-
niscent of Lily Allen or The Ting 
Tings. Branded as more personal 
by the alternative music press, 
the album secured her place as 
opener for Katy Perry on her Cal-
ifornia Dreams Tour and Cold-
play’s Mylo Xyloto Tour. 

Her 2012 album Electra Heart 

leans much more heavily toward 
pop. With tracks “How To Be 
A Heartbreaker,” “Bubblegum 
Bitch” and the popular “Prima-
donna,” the album’s themes are 
centered in a ruthless depic-
tion of American culture and 
especially its expectations for 
women. Without listening to 
the lyrics, Electra Heart might 
seem like an album filled with 
top-down 
convertible, 
feel 

good pop beats, but Marina’s 
highly intellectual and socially 
charged words create a differ-
ent picture. Her second release 
definitely widened the artist’s 

audience with its pop sound, 
but also served to upset some of 
her original fans who liked what 
was perceived as her more per-
sonal side.

Interviews with the musician 

reveal that this is exactly what 
she’s about: she’s an artist whose 
work is highly personal, but is 
also created within a broader 
social and musical context – and 
she knows it. She explains Elec-
tra Heart in an interview with 
music website The Line of Best 
Fit that “when I was projecting 
cynicism, or when I was being 
snarky or whatever, I was myself 
all the time.” She emphasizes her 
personal relationship with her 
music again in a 2013 Huffington 
Post interview, Marina said of 
her music, “I’ll always be present 
because I’m writing it.”

The artist, who will turn 30 

years old later this year, seems 
to have matured with Froot. 
After years of unhappiness and a 
lack of self-assuredness, her lat-
est release opens with the song 
“Happy,” with peaceful, dreamy, 
yet still slightly melancholy mel-
ody and lyrics of vulnerability 
and self-acceptance that com-
municate, “So now you know, 
you know it all/That I’ve been 
desperately alone,” but that “I’ve 
found what I’ve been looking 
for in myself.” She lets listeners 
know right away that although 
she’s faced hardship and regret, 
she’s at peace. 

Without 
a 
dull 
moment, 

Marina picks things up straight 
away 
with 
the 
title 
track 

“Froot,” which appeals to her 
pop side with a fast, electronic 
and swinging beat. Its candy 
sweet, feel good sound is remi-
niscent of some kind of hybrid of 
Katy Perry’s “California Gurls” 
and ABBA’s catchy ’70s beats. 
Similarly, listeners won’t be able 
to keep their shoulders from 
swaying to subsequent tracks 
“Blue,” “I’m a Ruin” and “Can’t 
Pin Me Down.” These tracks are 
fun and upbeat but with an edge, 
“Blue” and “I’m a Ruin” being 
about bad relationship habits 
and “Can’t Pin Me Down” play-
ing with some ideas about the 
American female archetype she 
explored in Electra Heart.

While 
she 
does 
let 
her 

pop 
tendencies 
show 
with 

Froot, Marina doesn’t forget 
the 
explicitly 
personal 
and 

insightful 
musician 
she’s 

always 
been. 
Even 
her 

brightest, lightest songs have an 
underlying eeriness because of 
the electronic minor vocals she 
incorporates into the harmonies 
of all her songs. In addition, no 
matter how happy and light 
her melodies and beats may 
seem, Marina’s lyrics are always 
steeped in critical introspection 
or insightful social commentary.

Directly 
appealing 
to 
her 

darker side are tracks “Solitaire” 
and “Weeds,” both covering 
deeply personal subject matter, 
using bass beats and dreamy 
electronic 
sounds 
in 
the 

background to create a heavier, 
more serious tone. “Solitaire” 
pairs sweet, twinkling, chime-
like instrumentals and echoing 
vocals with lyrics describing the 
emptiness of consumerism and 
materialism, saying “I see people 
and cars covered in gold / And I’m 
happy to be on my own.” 

So many songs with weighty 

lyrics about bad habits, mistakes 
and a certain cynicism do seem 
a little unexpected in the context 
of the album’s opening track, 
“Happy.” It seems like this song 
should be at the end of the album, 
the conclusion to all of the inner 
turmoil expressed throughout 
the rest of the collection. Instead, 
Froot ends with “Immortal,” its 
dark sounds and lyrics dealing 
with issues of human life’s 
meaning in context of its brevity, 
making sure listeners know she’s 
not to be taken lightly as an artist 
and a mind. 

Froot is undoubtedly a step 

forward for Marina and the Dia-
monds. She clearly has reached 
a level of self-acceptance as an 
individual and an artist with 
songs appealing to both pop 
elements and deeply personal 
elements, and not without the 
streak of intellectual social 
commentary that she’s become 
known for. People who aren’t 
yet Marina fans are sure to gain 
a newfound respect for her as an 
artist if they give this album a 
serious listen.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Freshman forward Dylan Larkin was a unanimous selection as Big Ten Freshman of the Year on Monday.
Larkin, Hyman lead 
All-Big Ten honorees

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Writer

Despite ending the regular 

season on a sour note, the 
Michigan hockey team found a 
small bit of consolation Monday.

Forward Dylan Larkin was 

unanimously selected the Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year, and 
was joined on the All-Big Ten 
first team by senior forward 
Zach Hyman and freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski. 

Meanwhile, 
junior 
forward 

Andrew Copp and sophomore 
defenseman Michael Downing 
picked up second team honors.

Larkin led all freshmen in 

the conference with 43 points 
(15 
goals, 
28 
assists) 
and 

became the first Wolverine 
freshman since 2008 to top 40 
points in a season. Playing on 
Michigan’s 
most 
productive 

line throughout the season, 
Larkin never missed a beat 
adjusting to the college game, 
which Berenson attributed to 
his speed.

“What’s 
most 
impressive 

about him is his skating,” 
Berenson said. “His quickness 
off the mark is as good as 
anybody. One step, and he’s 
moving, whereas some guys 
you watch and it’s two or three 
or four steps and they get some 
speed, and he’s already past 
them.

“We knew about his puck 

touches and scoring ability and 
skill level, but I didn’t know 
he would be this quick off the 
mark, and he does it every 
night.”

Joining him on both the first 

team and the All-Freshman 
team is his roommate, Werenski. 
The freshman led all Big Ten 
defensemen with nine goals and 
rose to become Michigan’s top 
defenseman 
despite 
graduating 
high school a 
year early.

Both 

highly touted 
well 
before 

arriving 
to 

campus, 
the 

pair led their 
respective 
units 
throughout 
the 
year, 

exceeding even the highest 
expectations.

“Early in the fall, I felt we 

had two impact freshmen,” 
Berenson said of the pair. 
“That’s what we got, which is 
hard for them because they had 
to live up to a lot of expectations 
— and they’ve handled it really 
well. I think either one of them 
could’ve won (Freshman of the 
Year), but good for Dylan, no 
surprise here.”

Also unsurprising is Hyman’s 

unanimous selection on the first 
team. The senior had a breakout 
season, leading the Big Ten 
with 49 points and drawing 
serious consideration for the 
Hobey Baker Award, given to 
the nation’s top player.

More surprising might be 

Michigan 
State 
goaltender 

Jake Hildebrand’s selection as 
Big Ten Player of the Year. The 
junior paced the conference 
with six shutouts, a .930 save 
percentage and a 2.12 goals-
against average, propelling an 

otherwise-mediocre 
Spartan 

team to a late-season surge and 
a second-place Big Ten finish.

But still, with a mix of 

playmaking 
ability, 
team-

focused 
efforts on both 
ends of the ice 
and a flurry of 
highlight reel 
goals, Hyman 
presented 
a 

compelling 
case for voters, 
including 
Berenson.

“Absolutely, 

as deserving as anyone (for 
the award),” Berenson said. 
“But you can make the case 
for 
anyone 
else 
up 
there 

in 
the 
conference. 
There’s 

(defenseman Mike Reilly) from 
Minnesota, (Hildebrand) from 
Michigan State, (forward Casey 
Bailey) from Penn State — I’m 
sure they were all up there in 
people’s minds. But the player 
we see every day, it’s pretty 
hard to say anyone’s any better 
than he is.”

In total, Michigan led the 

Big Ten with five honorees, 
while 
Minnesota 
had 
four, 

Michigan State had two and 
Penn State added one. Berenson 
sees the quantity of awards as a 
reflection of what the team has 
done, and what it’s capable of 
down the road.

“To me, this is team time,” 

Berenson said. “As much as 
we’re happy for the players that 
win the awards, they’ve got to 
realize that the reason they won 
the awards is because they had a 
good team around them.”

“His quickness 

off the mark 
is as good as 

anybody.”

Michigan battling through 
March ups and downs

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

With the bulk of its non-

conference season behind it, the 
first quarter of the season was 
very much an 
up-and-down 
experience for 
the Michigan baseball team.

It has shined in an eight-game 

winning streak and slumped in 
losses to sub-.500 competition, 
but the record reflects that 
the Wolverines are heading 
to the Big Ten portion of their 
schedule with three more wins 
than they did at the same point 
last year.

By getting off to quick starts in 

games, grooming a serviceable 
bullpen and allowing freshmen 
to step up when injuries occur, 
the team has accumulated a 11-7 
record.

Michigan has scored during 

its first turn at bat in five of its 
last six games, often kicking 
the opposition into catch-up 
mode in the early innings of 
the game. Staples at the top of 
the lineup include junior Jacob 
Cronenworth, freshman Jake 
Bivens, 
sophomore 
Carmen 

Benedetti and senior Jackson 
Glines.

“One of our offensive goals 

is to score first,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “When you 
can jump out to an early lead it 
gives you more opportunities 
to take chances on the bases. 
It’s just a good feeling to pitch 
with a lead and hit with a lead — 
it’s kind of the old adage to get 
ahead and stay ahead. I think 
our hitters come out every game 
ready to play and have quality 
at-bats.”

This season, the Wolverines 

have outscored opponents by a 
total of 13-6 in the first inning, 
which has ended up being the 
third-highest-scoring frame for 
Michigan.

INJURIES LINGER FOR 

KEY 
PLAYERS: 
Junior 

shortstop 
Travis 
Maezes 

has remained unable to play 
in many of the Wolverines’ 
games since the team traveled 
to Savannah, Georgia in late 
February. 
Recently, 
Bakich 

has inserted him in the lineup 
for a few games, but Maezes 
hasn’t been able to make it 
much longer than his first at-bat 
without retreating to the bench 
for a replacement. The team is 
calling his ailment a “lower-
body injury.” In an effort to cut 
down on the amount of ground 

Maezes has to cover defensively, 
Bakich shifted him to third base, 
pulling Eric Jacobson, who 
usually plays second base, to 
anchor shortstop for Michigan.

“(Maezes) was shut down 

all weekend,” Bakich said. “He 
tried to give it a go in the first 
game on Friday, but after his 
first at-bat, (he) realized that he 
just wasn’t able to contribute to 
the team the way he wanted to. 
I know he’s very frustrated, but 
he’s one of the best players in 
the country and a huge part of 
our team.”

An injury to look for in the 

coming week is to Lamb, who 
was shaking his arm after 
being taken out of the game 
last Friday. Bakich said Lamb 
will undergo tests this week 
to determine the extent of the 
injury.

The Wolverines have also 

long been awaiting the return 
of 
junior 
left-hander 
Evan 

Hill, who has been rehabbing 
a knee injury for a number of 
months. It has been the goal 
to have the team’s ace return 
to the Michigan rotation early 
in Big Ten season. Still, Hill 
will not be available to pitch in 
next weekend’s series against 
Nebraska.

NOTEBOOK

Michigan earns WNIT bid

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team’s season will 
continue for at least a little 
while longer. Monday night, the 
Wolverines earned the Big Ten’s 
automatic bid into the WNIT. 
The 
invitation 
marks 
their 

sixth straight postseason bid — 
the longest streak in program 
history.

Michigan will host Cleveland 

State in the first round of 
the 
tournament 
Wednesday 

night, with game time yet to be 
announced. The Vikings (10-6 
Horizon League, 19-12 overall) 
are coming off an appearance 
in their conference tournament 
semifinals, when they lost by 12 
to Wright State.

If the Wolverines (8-10 Big 

Ten, 16-14 overall) advance past 
Wednesday, they will play the 
winner of Friday’s matchup 
between Toledo and Wright 
State. Other teams in Michigan’s 

region include Akron, Missouri 
and a team the Wolverines 
defeated in December: Eastern 
Michigan.

The WNIT berth comes after 

a blowout loss to Michigan State 
in the Big Ten Tournament, 
eliminating 
any 
chance 
of 

reaching the NCAA Tournament 
for the second time in three 
years.

For much of the 2014-15 

season, Michigan appeared to 
be a contender for the NCAA 
Tournament with an impressive 
resume 
that 
included 
an 

overtime win against Ohio State, 
a 
comeback 
victory 
against 

Northwestern and a regular-
season sweep of in-state rival 
Michigan State.

After posting a 5-2 record in 

January, though, the Wolverines 
found themselves in a downward 
spiral 
during 
February. 
En 

route to going 3-6 that month, 
Michigan 
couldn’t 
finish 
a 

comeback bid against then-
No. 21 Rutgers, relinquished a 

sizable lead over Ohio State in 
Columbus, lost at the buzzer 
to Northwestern at home and 
couldn’t 
hold 
together 
long 

enough against Minnesota in 
double overtime.

With a poor February showing 

and an embarrassing conference 
tournament performance, it was 
inevitable that the Wolverines 
would be heading for the WNIT.

This year’s WNIT appearance 

is Michigan’s second straight 
and seventh overall, and the 
second under the tutelage of 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. Last 
year, the Wolverines hosted the 
first two rounds before suffering 
a third-round loss at Bowling 
Green.

Michigan’s best run in the 

tournament 
came 
during 

the 
2009-10 
season 
under 

then-coach 
Kevin 
Borseth. 

During 
that 
campaign, 
the 

Wolverines earned an at-large 
bid and hosted every game they 
played, ultimately losing in the 
semifinals to Miami.
