Students 
blared 
various 

demands for accountability and 
administrative action after weeks 
of racist provocations on campus 
earlier this semester, but one 
question echoed throughout all 
the protests.

“What 
happens 
to 
racist 

students 
who 
get 
caught?” 

LSA senior Arlyn Reed asked 
at a de-stress event held by the 
Black Student Union last month 
to rounds of applause from the 
audience.

“(A University of Michigan) 

investigation just means it is 
going to be swept under the rug, 
and I actually want punishment 
for these people, because I want 
to feel safe on campus,” LSA 
freshman 
Madison 
Peterson 

echoed at a protest the next day.

Reed, a former Central Student 

Government 
representative, 

went on to propose a student 
sanctioning process — similar 
to one mandated by the sexual 
misconduct policy — in the 
face of an uptick in bias-related 
incidents. The Dean of Student’s 
Bias Response Team has logged 
52 bias incidents since this July, 
but students are correct to point 
out neither University Division 
of Public Safety and Security 
officers nor administrators have 
publicly released apprehensions 
of any perpetrators.

The role of OSCR and a 
changing statement

The catch to Reed’s proposal 

is that the institutional process, 
in large part, already exists. 
The Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution 
is 
tasked 
with 

enforcing the Statement of Student 
Rights 
and 
Responsibilities 

and litigates cases spanning 
from alcohol abuse to falsifying 
University 
documents. 
OSCR 

uses a spectrum of tools to 
address formal violations of the 
statement, 
including 
conflict 

resolution, 
restorative 
justice 

or 
adjudication. 
Informal 

workshops include the option for 
unconscious bias training.

OSCR director Erik Wessel 

said the unit has handled more 
than one case of bias this year. E. 
Royster Harper, the University’s 
vice president for student life, 
however, said in a September 
interview she was not aware 
of one bias investigation to her 
knowledge addressed through 
OSCR. The statement’s language 
is ambiguous, and does not have a 

clause expressly sanctioning bias 
or discrimination. 

While the statement gives 

students the right “to be treated 
fairly and with dignity regardless 
of race, color, national origin, 
age, marital status, sex, sexual 
orientation, 
gender 
identity, 

gender 
expression, 
disability, 

religion, 
height, 
weight, 
or 

veteran status,” the document 
does not task students with 
the 
reciprocal 
responsibility. 

The only clause broaching bias 
Former

Rep. Jeff Irwin is launching his 
campaign for Michigan Senate, 
running in the 18th District. State 
Sen. Rebekah Warren, D-Ann 
Arbor, currently holds the seat, but 
is term limited and is unable to run 
again in 2018.

Irwin served in the House from 

2011 to 2016 in the 53rd District, 
which comprises the southern 
part of Ann Arbor and most of the 
University of Michigan’s campus. 
State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 
Arbor, succeeded Irwin earlier this 
year.

Irwin, known for his strong 

advocacy for public education, 
plans to continue to push for 
increased 
funding 
for 
public 

education, as well as addressing 
the 
criminal 
justice 
system, 

environmental concerns and the 
issues in Flint, among other issues. 

“I want to fight for tangible 

improvements to the quality of life 
for the people in Michigan,” Irwin 
said.

The Detroit Connector, a bus 

service connecting Ann Arbor to 
Detroit, will now provide service 
seven days a week, instead of four, 
and open full-time service to the 
public Oct. 30.

The 
bus 
service, 
which 

used to serve only University 
of Michigan staff, faculty and 
students, will include stops at the 
Central Campus Transit Center, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Detroit Center and, newly, at 
the University of Michigan at 
Dearborn campus. Service hours 
are also being expanded, with new 
hours on Fridays and Saturdays 
beginning at 7 a.m. and ending at 
1 a.m.

The bus was piloted in 2013 

after student demand was assessed 
via survey. The initial results of the 
survey indicated over 75 percent of 
possible riders were ‘very likely’ to 
use the service if it were provided. 
The bus was a free service with a 
suggested $5 donation, and Mcard 
holders were able to bring four 
guests on the trip per day. There 
was also a rudimentary reservation 
system for the bus rides in 2014.

Fayrouz 
Saad, 
who 
is 

currently running for Congress 
in Michigan’s 11th District, says 
her political story started right in 
her dorm, freshman year at the 
University of Michigan.

As a Muslim and Arab 18-year-

old after the terrorist attacks 
on 9/11, Saad’s parents took her 
home from campus, wary of the 
discriminatory backlash against 
their identities.

But to Saad’s relief, waiting 

at her dorm was a collection 
of her roommates and friends, 
welcoming her home and ensuring 
her they would help combat hate. 
From that moment on, Saad knew 
she wanted to dedicate herself to 
protecting those values.

“It was just this really fine 

moment of humanism that was 
so very much what our country’s 
about 
and 
really 
profound 

experience that impacted me 
for the rest of my life,” Saad said. 
“That is America and that is what 
America should represent.”

Even today, Saad keeps up 

with events on the University 
of Michigan campus, and the 
racially charged incidents that 
have happened recently have only 
reiterated what she wants to fight 
against.

“It broke my heart when I heard 

about the racially charged hate 
crimes on campus because I don’t 
remember hearing about any of 
that even after 9/11. I remember 
quite the opposite,” Saad said. 
“That got me thinking about why 
I want to get in public service. I 
really want to protect ... our values. 
I want to fight for those values that 
I know we all believe in.”

Rep. 
Dave 
Trott, 

R-Birmingham, decided not to 
run in the 2018 congressional 
race, leaving no incumbent to run 
against, and making what used 
to be a clearly Republican leaning 
district more of a toss-up between 
new Republican and Democratic 
runners. 
College 
Republicans 

did not respond to requests for 
comment. 

Still, Saad said she has a long 

road ahead of her. If elected, she 
will be the first Muslim woman 
in Congress, setting a precedent

Councilmembers facing backlash for kneeling at last week’s meeting, defend their decisions

Aug. 26, 2016, San Francisco 

49ers 
quarterback 
Colin 

Kaepernick 
remained 
seated 

during the national anthem of a 
National Football League preseason 
game to protest the oppression of 
people of color and ongoing issues 
of police brutality in those 
communities. Over a year 
later and thousands of 
miles away from Levi’s 
Stadium, Councilmember 
Chuck 
Warpehoski, 

D-Ward 5, tweeted he 
would take a kneeduring 
the 
evening’s 
City 

Council meeting “out of 
respect for the aspiration that 
we be a nation ‘with liberty 
and justice for all.’”

Four of the 11 City Council 

members decided to follow in suit 
of Kaepernick — Jason Frenzel, 
Sumi Kailasapathy, Chip Smith and 
Warpehoski. During the council’s 
meeting, Kailasapathy explained 
her decision to kneel, wanting 
others to judge her patriotism “by 
her actions.” In an interview with 
CNN later in the week, she touched 
on about inclusion — citing her 
experiences as a refugee — and 
brought up police brutality with 
The New York Times on Thursday. 
 
 

Smith had not planned to 

kneel before the evening, but 
upon entering the City Council 
chambers, 
Kailasapathy 

approached him and asked him 
to join her in protest.

“She is the only member of 

Council who’s a person of color, 
she’s a woman, she’s a refugee, she’s 
a naturalized citizen,” Smith said. 
“If she asks me to kneel in solidarity 

with her — for this absolutely, I 
didn’t give it a second thought.”

He later released a statement, 

stating he knelt to stand in solidarity 
with those who experience racism, 
sexism, classism and homophobia 
every day. 

Councilmember 
Graydon 

Krapohl, D-Ward 4, was one of 
the council members who chose to 
remain standing, citing disrespect 

to military service members. 

Kaepernick, 

however, 

switched 
from sitting 
to kneeling 
over a year 
ago 
after 

consulting 
with 
veterans 
on 
an 

appropriate 

action.

“Personally I didn’t think it was 

appropriate, that’s not something 
I would do; I would like people 
not to do it,” Krapohl said. “But I 
understand and respect the folks 

that do do it, that they feel that they 
have a message, something they 
want to say, and it’s their right to do 
it. From my perspective I’ve served 
30 years in the military and I think 
it’s disrespectful.”

Following 
the 
evening’s 

meeting, council members who 
knelt received criticism, echoing 
Krapohl’s 
sentiment 
that 
the 

gesture was disrespectful to the 
U.S. military. Others condemned 
the council’s “empty gesture,” 
noting a lack of political action in 
regard to issues of police brutality 
in the Ann Arbor community.

Austin McCoy, a postdoctoral 

fellow at the University, took to 
Twitter to call on City Council to 
do more to address racial inequality 

than kneel during the Pledge of 

Allegiance.

In an email interview with 

The Daily, McCoy explained 

his condemnation of the 
council’s actions centered 
largely 
around 
their 

failure 
to 
mention 

the fatal shooting of 
Aura Rosser in their 
reasoning for kneeling. 
Rosser, a Black woman, 

was shot by an Ann Arbor 

police officer in her home 

on Nov. 9, 2014 — her death 
sparked dozens of local protests 
and calls for police reform.

“The original intent 

of Colin Kaepernick’s protest was 
not just to highlight structural 
racism, but to call attention to police 
killings of African Americans,” 

McCoy wrote. “Failing to link that 
intent explicitly with Rosser’s death 
demonstrates a denial of local law 
enforcement’s role in contributing 
to the national trend of the police 
killings of African Americans. It 
also continues the troubling trend 
of rendering black women like 
Rosser invisible in conversations 
about racism and policing.”

More recently, the Ann Arbor 

Police Department came under fire 
for a violent arrest of local Black 
teen Ciaeem Slaton September at 
the Blake Transit Center. AAPD 
Police Chief Jim Baird wrote 
an email to the council that a 
personnel 
complaint 
is 
under 

review. Council members have not 
brought the arrest up at meetings 
in the last month.

McCoy 
noted 
City 
Council 

members have the ability to 
actually influence policy and if 
they care about racial inequality 
in policing, they should use their 
position to change local law.

“I think it is important for 

elected officials, and those in 
power, generally, to be more 
specific about how they plan 
on going about addressing the 
relationship 
between 
policing, 

structural racism and sexism, and 
poverty here in Ann Arbor,” McCoy 
said.

Last month Rackham student 

Dana Greene knelt on the block ‘M’ 
for 21 hours. While he appreciates 
the thought behind City Council 
members’ kneeling, he too believed 
as public officials, they can do more.

“The reason I protest and many 

other people protest is we feel like 
we don’t really have the ability to 
make progressive change outside 
of our ability to protest and so that’s 
why we decide to do it,” Greene

Citing modern and historical 

human rights crises, Sheri Fink, 
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author 
and University alum, challenged 
an audience of over 100 students 
and 
community 
members 

gathered Monday evening in the 
University of Michigan Museum 
of Art to consider how they would 
aid the most vulnerable members 
of society in an emergency.

Fink spent the majority of 

her lecture delineating how 
government 
agencies 
and 

response teams handled various 
emergencies, ranging from the 
Balkan Wars to Hurricane Irma, 
and subsequent effects on the 
critically injured and sick.

She 
noted 
emergencies 

function as a sort of test for 
the level of human rights in a 

society. The way individuals and 
organizations 
work 
together 

under extreme pressure, she 
argued, has the potential to have 
a major effect on the outcome of 
the crisis at hand.

“How much power do we 

have when our infrastructure 
is not what it should be? When 
we’re in situations that we can’t 
control that have problems,” she 
said. “Even in these situations 
of 
extreme 
emergency, 
that 

individual decisions and the way 
organizations are setup to run, 
all of that can have a really big 
impact, a life and death impact.”

Fink, who won a Pulitzer 

Prize in 2010 for her reporting 
on doctors’ decisions during 
Hurricane Katrina and in 2015 for 
her work during the 2014 Ebola 
crisis, described the immense 
rationing 
of 
medical 
and 

comfort supplies that occurred 
inside the volunteer tents. She 

questioned the rationale used in 
the division of the supplies, and 
said Americans usually received 
a much higher level of care.

“Who gets access to the 

higher standard of care?” she 
asked. “Can you really set up 
an advanced treatment unit on 
Liberian soil for Americans when 
the Liberians are losing their 
lives?”

She stated hospitals have 

a difficult time procuring the 
highest 
attainable 
standard 

of health care during times of 
relative tranquility, so these 
disparities become especially 
pronounced in emergency due 
to the scarcity of medicine and 
intense need for health care.

Fink concluded by asking 

students to consider what they 
would do if faced with such a 
situation — once again noting the 
importance of thinking critically 
and responding rapidly in an 

emergency where hundreds of 
lives are at stake.

“That 
ability 
to 
retain 

flexibility, to think clearly 
about what your goals are, 
whether 
it’s 
maintaining 

health care or promoting 
human rights or the best 
possible medical ethics, in 
situations of great stress and 
emergency — that these are 
possible,” she said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Jordan 

Brady said she attended the 
event as an addendum to 
her political science class, as 
well as its relevance to recent 
natural disasters and what she 
wants to study.

“Just discussing how we 

go about choosing who lives 
through these situations, and 
it really stuck out to me how 
hospitals and big organizations 
don’t really have a great plan 
until the last minute hits 
and then they’re panicking 
trying to help people and save 
people,” she said.

First lady Melania Trump 

and Secretary of Education 
Betsy Devos visited Orchard 
Lake Middle School in West 
Bloomfield Township, Mich., to 
kick off the “Week of Inclusion,” 
a part of National Bullying 
Prevention Month.

The first lady urged the 

students she spoke with to make 
new friends through sitting 
with people they didn’t know 
and promoting an inclusive 
environment.

“I encourage you to find a 

new friend and eat lunch with 
the new friend — you know a 
friend — ask them what they 
like, what their problems are — 
so nobody becomes sad,” said 
the first lady, according to CBS 
Detroit.

In a statement released by 

the White House, the visit was 
part of the first lady’s anti-

bullying initiative, “No One Eats 
Alone.”

“As part of my ongoing 

commitment to the overall 
well-being of children, I am 
looking forward to today’s 
visit,” the first lady said. “By our 
own example, we must teach 
children to be good stewards of 
the world they will inherit. We 
need to remember that they are 
always watching and listening. 
It is our responsibility to take 
the lead in teaching children 
the values of empathy and 
communication that are at the 
core of kindness, mindfulness, 
integrity and leadership.”

The first lady’s anti-bullying 

initiative has not been very 
popular in light of her husband’s 
use of Twitter to often belittle 
others.

that could mean a lot for younger 
generations looking to get involved 
with politics.

“I think what I’m trying to do is 

change the face of leadership and 
that starts at the most grassroot 
level –– college campuses,” Saad 
said. “Just get involved. Get engaged 
on campus.”

Public Policy senior Nadine

Central 
Student 

Government vice president, said 
seeing a Muslim woman continue 
to break the glass ceiling and 
strive for positions of power was 
inspirational.

“I believe she is doing the work 

that lays the foundation for girls and 
women, including myself, to keep 
shattering the glass ceiling,” Jawad 
said.

Jawad said Muslim women are 

particularly underrepresented in 
all levels of government. She added 
while there is diversity within the 
Muslim world itself, Fayrouz is a 
great step in the right direction for 
the community.

“Fayrouz is challenging the 

normalization of this exclusion and 
setting an example to empower 
others to run for office,” Jawad said. 
“Muslims aren’t a monolith and 
within our identity we have a lot of 
diversity, but I believe it is important 
to have Muslim voices in all levels of 
governments, as so often decisions 
are made about us without us.”

Prior 
to 
this 
campaign, 

Saad worked on John Kerry’s 
2004 campaign, in the Obama 
Administration’s Department of 
Homeland Security department 
and was the director of immigrant 
and international affairs for Detroit 
Mayor Mike Duggan.

Students on campus seem to be 

enthusiastic about Saad’s campaign. 
LSA junior Meaghan Wheat said 
Saad has a lot of merit and would 
be a step in the right direction 
regardless of her identity.

“I’m interested in following 

her 
campaign, 
and 
definitely 

support the need for a different 
representative in District 11,” Wheat 
said. “She seems to have good 
experience in government.”

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Zoha 

Qureshi agreed with Jawad in 
that diversity in government is 
necessary to involve all perspectives 
in the process. Qureshi, a CSG 

representative, said Saad’s story 
is particularly inspiring to her 
political aspirations.

“Especially in today’s political 

climate, 
it’s 
super 
important 

to 
increase 
diversity 
in 
our 

government at all levels,” Qureshi 
said. “With diversity comes more 
representation, more perspectives, 
and a stronger understanding 
of each other and how we can 
collectively and positively impact 
our communities. As a woman and a 
minority interested in public office 
myself, I love that Fayrouz Saad is 
running.”

Saad said her focus for her 

Congressional race will be on health 
care, as she wants to work toward 
universal health care. She also cited 
economic growth as a goal, and 
wants to incentivize automation 
within the economy. Saad said 
she hopes that in implementing 
these goals she inspires younger 
generations to set lofty political 
goals.

“U of M is probably one of the 

most 
dynamic 
campuses. 
It’s 

right for activism and student 
engagement in so many ways,” Saad 
said. “Find an issue or cause you 
believe in and become a leader on 
campus.”

The service has faced a tenuous 

future in recent years; in July of 
2015, University officials were 
planning to cancel funding for 
the service by the end of 2016. 
However, 
Central 
Student 

Government passed a resolution to 
encourage the University to extend 
it back in April of 2016. 

Riders 
can 
now 
make 

reservations online and one-way 
trips range between $6 and $10. 
Students who have Pell Grants 
will be able to use the Connector 
for 
free. 
University 
students 

and faculty who participate in 
community service and class 
activities in Detroit will have 
reduced fares.

Chief diversity officer Robert 

Sellers, vice provost for equity and 
inclusion, spoke on the bus service 
in a press release.

“The University of Michigan 

is deeply committed to creating 
a more diverse, equitable and 
inclusive campus environment,” 
Sellers 
said. 
“The 
Detroit 

Connector helps us break down 
existing 
barriers 
and 
better 

connect the Ann Arbor, Dearborn 
and Detroit communities. By 
expanding service and opening it to 
the public, the Detroit Connector 
can improve access to the region’s 
numerous research, academic and 
cultural opportunities.”

The Detroit Connector has 

operated from donations, grants 
and some funding from the Office 
of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
and Detroit Center since 2013. The 
buses are wheelchair accessible 
and include Wi-Fi, restrooms, 
electrical outlets and bike storage 
on board.

Craig 
Regester, 
associate 

director of the Semester in Detroit 
program, is one of the two central 
originators of the proposal for the 
Detroit Connector with the U-M 
Detroit Center. He said he hopes 
the expansions will build ridership 
that will be mutually beneficial to 
all.

“The original vision of the 

Detroit 
Connector 
always 

sought the building of mutually-
beneficial connections and access 
for residents in both Ann Arbor 
and Detroit, not just an easy way 
for UM students to get to the big 
city,” Regester said. “Now that 
the service is open to the general 

public, and provided daily, we 
believe this vision can be fully 
realized. Of course, now, we all 
need to help build ridership and 
to spread the word to our friends, 
colleagues and neighbors to ‘Get 
on the Bus!’”

Feedback from students, like 

LSA junior Jenny Ghose, has been 
positive. 

“I used the Detroit Connector 

a ton during my freshman year 
when I was really homesick and 
went home once a month. For the 
past couple years, I have used it 
when I go home for the weekend, 
about twice a semester,” Ghose 
wrote in an email. “I have been 
hoping for extended hours since I 
first learned about the connector 
during my freshman year. The 
original hours were better than 
nothing, 
but 
extending 
the 

hours really expands the realm 
of possibilities for students like 
myself who rely on the connector 
to go home or for students who 
use the connector to go back-
and-forth to events in Detroit. It 
really provides a great service for 
students from the Metro Detroit 
area and connects our campus to 
all of the great things going on in 
Detroit these days.”

incidents prohibits students from 
“harassing or bullying another 
person−physically, 
verbally, 
or 

through other means,” but proving 
such a violation in a clear and 
persuasive manner can be a high 
standard to clear.

The lack of language also means 

OSCR does not automatically 
collect data on cases of bias the 
office receives.

“We don’t have many metrics 

around that, no,” Harper said.

With the statement up for 

revisions next fall, some students 
are trying to change that.

CSG Rep. Andrew Watkins, a 

Public Policy senior, is leading a 
team of students working with 
OSCR, the Office of General 
Counsel and the Dean of Students 
to explore an amendment to the 
statement that explicitly bans bias 
incidents. Proposed amendments 
are community-based and go 
through rounds of review from 
CSG, 
Senate 
Assembly 
and 

executive officers.

“Bias 
incidents 
against 
an 

identity group on campus don’t 
classify as a violation under the 
current 
statement,” 
Watkins 

said. “The legal definition of 
harassment is much too strict — 
like if somebody does something 
offensive to a student, that doesn’t 
(always) qualify as harassment 
unfortunately, so they can’t be 
disciplined under that section.”

LSA junior Ayah Issa, a former 

CSG representative and a member 
of the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion Student Advisory Board, 
echoed Watkins.

“It’s 
almost 
unrealistic 
to 

assume things that affect students 
daily or what’s been happening 
this past month fit within that 
realm of harassment — and 
that’s wrong,” Issa said. “We are 
looking for a realistic turnover. 
We don’t know whether that’s 
amending the students’ rights 
and 
responsibilities 
statement 

or adding a new academic honor 

code.”

Harper, 
Wessel 
and 
Dean 

of Students Laura Blake Jones 
are amenable to the proposed 
amendment. Wessel maintained, 
however, no matter the language 
in the statement, it’s up to the 
community to change.

“Do I think that mere change 

to language in a policy is going 
to change ideology? No.” he said. 
“Do I think that a double-down 
on our University’s commitment 
to values and the pathways that 
we have available to us … when 
harm is created in our community. 
… Do I think that’s always a good 
approach? Absolutely.”
Bureaucracy and challenges

All students and administrators 

cited inherent tension, though, in 
weighing campus climate with 
students’ constitutional rights to 
free speech.

Issa said CSG is working 

alongside Student Legal Services 
to avoid infringing upon students’ 
rights and instead help protect 
them.

“How do you mention (bias) 

without being too broad?” she 
said. “Too vague leads to too much 
power.”

OSCR’s 
complaint-driven 

structure itself raises barriers 
to victims of bias incidents; 
administrators cannot officially 
respond to incidents that are not 
reported.

Harper said in her experience, 

students 
might 
be 
wary 
of 

retaliation, or more often are simply 
unaware of the processes available 
to them. The Bias Response 
Team — which focuses more on 
documentation and support — 
does not always refer reporters to 
OSCR as a potential channel, often 
because perpetrators’ identities 
remain unknown.

“Students 
of 
color 
aren’t 

involved in crafting the process,” 
she said. “There are gaps between 
the Bias Response Team and 
OSCR, and we need to make sure 
students know how to use the 
codes. But sometimes they just 
don’t want to report.”

On a more surface level, many 

are unaware of the statement’s 

existence.

Engineering senior Nick Morris, 

for example, said he remembers 
agreeing to the statement, but 
could not recall what it specifically 
outlined. He said it seemed to be 
a generic document of rules and 
regulations.

“I remember signing that, but 

I don’t remember exactly what 
was in it,” Morris said. “Is it just 
that we have the right to receive 
equal and fair treatment, and that 
as a student, we must abide by 
University rules and respect other 
students and faculty? I remember 
it seeming like a generic rules, 
regulations and respect kind of 
document.”

Issa and Watkins emphasized 

boosting the statement’s visibility 
and 
publicizing 
bias-specific 

language. Students, they argue, 
will be more aware of what they 
are opting into.

“The first problem with the 

current statement, is that nobody 
knows it,” Watkins said. “Everyone 
did sign it. … There’s no exposure 
to it and students don’t know 
about it. What we are hoping 
with a separate document would 
be, maybe during the admissions 
process … that you explicitly agree 
to these terms.”

“People won’t do things if they 

know they will get punished or 
if we have a policy in place,” Issa 
said. “If there’s no accountability, 
then what do you hold a person up 
to?”
Precedent ––or a lack thereof 

Though 
a 
bias-minded 

amendment would be the first of 
its kind at the University, several 
other schools already have these 
kinds of policies in effect.

The University of Virginia 

includes a section called “Freedom 
from 
Discrimination” 
on 
its 

policy for Students Rights and 
Responsibilities. The University 
of Michigan’s Nondiscrimination 
Policy, on the other hand, is more 
concerned with employment and 
institutional inequity.

said. “City Council members on 
the other hand have the ability 
to do so. I can appreciate them 
kneeling in solidarity but I also 
want to see action followed up by 
that.”
Policing in Ann Arbor

On July 13, 2016, the Ann Arbor 

Human 
Rights 
Commission 

published a statement calling 
on city officials to expedite the 
formation of a civilian police 
oversight board. The oversight 
board was originally suggested 
following the shooting of Aura 
Rosser, but Jim Baird, Ann Arbor 
Police Chief, strongly urged no 
action be taken until the city 
completed a third-party audit of 
the police department.

Seven months later, Feb. 21, 

2017, City Council approved a 
$200,000 contract with Chicago-
based 
security 
consulting 

firm Hillard Heintze to assess 
community relations between 
police and AAPD, and offer 
suggestions in implementing a 
civilian police oversight board. 
In March, the council moved 
forward with phase one of the 
review.

Many Ann Arbor residents 

were upset with the council’s 
decision 
to 
ignore 
the 

Human 
Rights 
Commission’s 

recommendation and postpone 
the potential implementation of a 
oversight board.

“Instead of throwing full 

support 
behind 
the 
Human 

Rights 
Commission’s 
report 

calling for citizen oversight, the 
city spent another $200,000 on 
an external review conducted by 
a private consulting firm founded 
by 
police 
officials,” 
McCoy 

wrote. “The snail-like movement 
of this process makes me wonder 
whether or not city government 
wants citizen oversight. It is 
clear that the police do not want 
it because (Baird) has already 
said so. However, I do not care 
what the chief says, every police 
department in this country needs 
citizen oversight, including Ann 
Arbor’s.”

Frenzel explained the process 

halted in an effort to ensure it 
expands to be more inclusive.

“Certain council members, 

myself included and certain 
community 
members 
pushed 

to have more voices included in 
the collection of information and 
that postponed the output of the 
report from them,” Frenzel said. 
“We were suppose to get that 

report in August and now we’re 
getting it in November because 
they had to take a step back and 
collect more information. It’s 
still debatable how inclusive that 
report is or is not, but that work 
has from some vantage points 
attempted to be more thorough.”

According 
to 
Krapohl, 
a 

comprehensive review of the 
police department takes time.

“I don’t think we have many of 

the problems a lot of communities 
do across the country,” Krapohl 
said. “There are always ways we 
can get better and unfortunately 
many of these things take time. 
There has to be a deliberate 
process of review to ensure 
fairness for everyone involved.”

Phase 
one 
of 
the 
study 

consisted of collecting data on 
community members and law 
enforcements 
perspectives 

through surveys and forums. 
This took place over the summer 
meaning student voices were 
largely excluded.

City 
Council 
will 
discuss 

the Hillard Heintze phase one 
study in a work session Nov. 16. 
Smith anticipates it will suggest 
comprehensive reform.

“I fully expect it to challenge 

some of the standard ways we 
have always done things in Ann 
Arbor, I expect it to recommend 
a citizen oversight committee, I 
expect it to recommend changes 
to some of the departmental 
operating 
procedures; 
it 

might even go so far as to say 
real 
reorganization 
of 
the 

department,” Smith said.

“For 
reasons 
beyond 
my 

understanding, 
the 
Hillard 

Heintze 
study 
— 
the 
data 

collection component — the 
community 
conversation 

happened during the summer 
predominately when obviously 
students aren’t around, that 
predispositioned 
the 
data 

collection to a certain scenario,” 
Frenzel also noted.

Minority 
communities 

on 
campus 
have 
frequently 

expressed 
issues 
with 
over 

police. A Daily article published 
last Friday found at least six 
citations were issued to houses 
associated with Kappa Alpha Psi, 
a historically Black fraternity, 
and Latino fraternity Lambda 
Theta Phi during the Oct. 7 
football game against Michigan 
State. Of the 10 predominantly 
white 
fraternities 
surveyed 

by The Daily, none received 
citations.

Many of these lie within in 

Smith’s ward. Smith said he 
acknowledged changes must be 
made.

“I see the communication 

issues and gaps our police 
department 
has 
with, 
in 

particular, the African-American 
community here and I think 
we have to address that. To 
address it means we need to 
take a pretty self-critical look,” 
Smith said. “And taking a knee in 
solidarity with Councilmember 
Kailasapathy is my way of saying, 
‘Hey, I’m going to look hard in 
the mirror and see if their are 
better ways to do this.”

There is still concern that 

acknowledging a problem simply 
is not enough.

“There have been several 

instances of police brutality 
and I haven’t seen action being 
taken behind those incidents 
and so kneeling in solidarity is 
a nice gesture, but city council 
members are in a position to 
make greater change than that,” 
Greene said. “I would be ecstatic 
if I saw policy being developed 
to actually address these issues 
of police brutality and white 
supremacy but I am not sure if I 
am necessarily seeing that.”
Co-opting versus allyship

In 
late 
September 
2017, 

President 
Donald 
Trump 

tweeted a call on NFL players to 
stop kneeling during the national 
anthem and “disrespecting our 
Flag & Country.”

The tweet brought the debate 

back into the national spotlight. A 
growing number of professional 
athletes, high school athletes and 
fans subsequently began to kneel 
during the national anthem.

On Sep. 27, 16 members of New 

York City’s city council knelt 
during the Pledge of Allegiance 
and a dozen members of San 
Diego’s city council did the same 
on Oct. 10.

Some argue the popularization 

of this gesture detracts from 
Kaepernick’s original goal: to 
comment on oppression and 
police brutality in the Black 
community.

“While councilwoman Sumi 

Kailasapathy 
acknowledged 

that policing issue was on her 
mind, neither her nor Chuck 
Warpehoski 
mentions 
Aura 

Rosser by name, again, rendering 
her invisible in all of this,” McCoy 
said. “They haven’t said anything 
about Ciaeem Slaton’s violent 
arrest last month.”

Greene suggested protesters 

should expand on why they kneel, 
but as long as they recognize its 
original intent.

Y

ou, sir, are killing us!” 
shouted 
one 
of 
the 

students, 
as 
fellow 

protesters flashed signs accusing 
Charles Murray of being a white 
supremacist 
and 
a 

fascist. One went even 
further, pointing at 
Murray and accusing 
him of “denying her 
existence” 
since 

she is a woman of 
color in science. The 
protesters had been 
driven 
to 
disrupt 

Murray 
in 
large 

part 
because 
of 

his book “The Bell 
Curve,” which drew 
correlations between race and 
IQ and has rightly inspired a lot 
of suspicion among academics. 
Yet, to suggest Murray, who 
supports same-sex marriage and 
is an openly anti-Trump member 
of the Republican Party, is part 
and parcel of the white nativist 
movement is beyond a stretch — it 
is a lie.

The disruption of Murray’s 

speech 
at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
represented 
a 

worrying 
national 
trend 
— 

activists 
erroneously 
labeling 

the speech of a controversial 
speaker as hateful to prevent a 
free exchange of ideas. These 
mischaracterizations harm the 
very causes activists seek to 
bring attention to, by driving 
away legions of supporters from 
moderate students like myself. 
If they must disrupt speech, 
they would be wiser to target 
the outspokenly racist, sexist or 
“alt-right” ideologues who visit 
college campuses.

Murray is but one example 

of a mislabeled speaker — radio 
host Ben Shapiro, psychologist 
Jordan Peterson or even Claire 
Gastañaga, executive director 
of the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Virginia, have been 
grouped 
together 
with 
the 

genuinely incendiary like Milo 
Yiannopoulos, or worse, self-
proclaimed white nationalists 
like Richard Spencer. All have 
had their speeches canceled 
or disrupted despite their only 
shared belief being their support 
for absolute freedom of speech. 
Claire 
Gastañaga 
was 
even 

prevented from speaking at an 

event titled “Students and the 
First Amendment” when the 
ACLU announced its defense of 
the right for “alt-right” speakers 
to march in Charlottesville, Va.

Perhaps 
if 
the 

anger and labels were 
reserved 
for 
neo-

Nazis 
like 
Richard 

Spencer, the public 
would 
sympathize 

more 
with 
the 

goal 
of 
ridding 

these 
ideas 
from 

our 
communities. 

Unfortunately, 
the 

current 
state 
of 

activism leaves many 
Americans 
to 
fear 

that 
campuses 
have 
become 

completely intolerant of opposing 
ideas. 
After 
an 
Intelligence 

Squared debate at Yale University, 
66 percent of the audience agreed 
with the view that free speech is 
being threatened on campus, a 17 
percent increase from the tally at 
the start of the debate.

According to a Pew Research 

poll, four in 10 millennials believe 
the government should be able 
to prevent people from making 
statements that are offensive to 
minority groups, so I shudder 
at the thought of my generation 
becoming 
future 
legislators 

who take cues from the activist 
movement. 
They 
would 
be 

working on a slippery slope — how 
can you truly define offensive 
speech 
if 
every 
individual’s 

tolerance level to verbal abuse 
differs? While I can understand 
their sympathy for those hurt 
by racist speech, I am more 
skeptical of the nebulously defined 
microaggression that could nudge 
its way into such legislation; 
policing this type of language 
would be virtually impossible due 
to the limitless ways one can claim 
they were targeted.

It is important to understand 

the divide in reasoning that some 
activists seem to have compared 
to the general public, which 
widely 
condemns 
restrictions 

on hate speech. Some who seek 
to restrict speech apparently 
justify their belief with the notion 
that once words are perceived 
to be racist, they are justified 
in restricting it because these 
words can amount to mental 
and physical violence; in other 

words, it seems that those who 
defend free speech are condoning 
violence toward others. Since 
the police and administration 
aren’t preventing these attacks, 
it appears that some activists 
see it as their duty to disrupt 
supporters 
of 
free 
speech, 

sometimes resorting to tangible 
physical violence.

This 
reasoning 
is 
flawed. 

Most students who listen to 
“controversial” 
speakers 
are 

interested 
in 
an 
intellectual 

exchange of ideas or a chance to 
sit in and attempt to understand 
the ideas of the other side. Yet, at 
some universities, these curious 
listeners have had to dodge the 
fists of radical protesters who 
equate dialogue or interest in the 
other side with the same vigor as 
a line of marching Nazis. Their 
other equally unjustifiable tactics: 
blocking 
entrances, 
seizing 

microphones 
and 
mocking 

listeners leads to an atmosphere 
of fear on campus — but not to 
their intended targets. Ordinary 
students are the ones who feel 
the heat — at Yale University, 42 
percent of students and 71 percent 
of conservative students report 
that they feel uncomfortable 
giving their opinion on politics. 
This fear makes it harder for 
students to grasp onto their own 
unique set of political values, for 
they worry about straying too far 
from the party line on campus.

At 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, 
conservatives 

have 
felt 
this 
tension 
in 

their 
discussions, 
first-

year 
seminars 
and 
clubs. 

After 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s election, hundreds 
of community members on 
campus signed a petition in 
response to an open letter by 
a student at the University, 
affirming that they, too, felt 
unwelcome on campus. We 
should ensure our campus 
remains welcoming of these 
students, and stand up to 
unwarranted 
claims 
that 

associates them or the speakers 
they show up to listen to 
with the same anger directed 
toward fringe racist elements 
in our society.

C

harles 
Murray 
— 

controversial 
social 

scientist — delivered 

a speech on campus Oct. 11, 
despite somewhat significant 
protest. This, once again, 
raises two questions we seem 
incapable of escaping for the 
foreseeable political future: 
What are the limits of free 
speech, especially on college 
campuses? And who and what 
deserves to be protested? 

To immediately undermine 

myself, I don’t think free 
versus censored speech in a 
traditional sense is actually 
the 
interesting 
question. 

Murray is allowed to speak on 
this public university campus, 
whether or not the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 

College Republicans invite 
or sponsor him. What we 
as students, and many of 
us as activists, seem to be 
concerned 
with, 
though, 

is whether one should try 
to silence someone who, at 
best, walks the line between 
academic science and racism.

There is a distinction — and 

a majority of college students 
agree with me — between 
intentionally offensive rhetoric 
(such 
as 
racial 
slurs) 
and 

legitimate academic discourse, 
even over contentious topics. My 
resistance to protests designed to 
silence one’s opposition applies 
only to this sort of dialogue, 
where our primary question 
can safely be “What best checks 
speech we disagree with?” In 
this case, I think the answer is 
often counterspeech, not protest.

One of the forces keeping 

Murray’s ideas alive well past 
their expiration date is the 
allure of dangerous or forbidden 
ideas. I presume we’ve all met at 
least one person convinced that 
feminism is a grand conspiracy 
against men or that trans rights 
are just the result of wild liberal 
overreach. The same principle 

applies here: Some faction of 
people will believe individuals 
protest Murray’s ideas because 
they undermine the liberal lie, 
not because they’re relics from a 
worse part of our history.

A 
response 
designed 
to 

produce converts, then, meets 
the ideas of Murray and others 
like him directly. There is a 
definite place for general protest 
and I want to reiterate that this is 
not a condemnation of those who 
prefer that method; I only want 
to argue that when people frame 
themselves as trying to bring up 
opposing arguments in a world 
of political correctness, meeting 
one idea with another will be 
more effective than trying to 
drown them out. 

Physical protections of the 

University 
and 
University 

security aside, there are few 
places as well structured for 
counterspeech as a university. 
There were several professors 
among 
those 
protesting 

Murray; would none of them 
have been willing to make a 
counterpresentation, debunking 
Murray’s claim or defending an 
alternative philosophy? What 
about 
our 
student 
activists, 

who have proven themselves in 
the past to be quite persuasive? 
A parallel speech would offer 
interested parties the critical 
opportunity to show up for, 
rather than against, something.

It’s impossible to guarantee 

complete 
safety. 
One 
group 

divided, though, seems obviously 
more apt to dissolve into ugliness 
than two groups looking to be 
swayed. Each speech’s audience, 
thus, would be united in their 
demand 
from 
the 
speaker: 

Persuade me that you’re right, 
whether it’s for the first time or 
the fortieth time.

Protest 
asks 
whether 

certain ideas are “permitted”; 
counterspeech asks what ideas 
are more persuasive. The ability 
to mobilize is important, but — 
and I think this is fairly universal 
— the end goal is persuasion. Our 
highly monitored — especially 
in public spaces — environment 
here, along with the ideal of 
academic freedom, creates a 
safe space for dangerous ideas. 
What do we have to gain from 
forfeiting a chance to convert 
rather than contain?

Anger in response to people 

like Charles Murray is justified, 
and there are times when 
containment is the only rational 
course of action. Enabled here 
as we are to act politically, 
however, that anger might more 
effectively be directed toward 
winning the conflict of ideas. I 
don’t think Murray’s claims are 
hard to succeed against, but one 
cannot win a debate without 
first having one. If we are right, 
what ideological threat does a 
debate pose?

The effectiveness of otherwise 

feebly constructed arguments 
comes from their framing. As 
long as one gives their opposition 
grounds to claim that they are 
being silenced for speaking the 
uncomfortable truth, not for 
espousing bankrupt ideology, 
they cede their strongest tool 
for argument. In the context of 
a university, winning debates 
will be more effective than 
preventing them.

Mugging at the gym

COREY DULIN | COLUMN

I 

can’t just get up and go to 
the gym — it’s a process. 
I 
need 
to 
get 
there 

physically and mentally. The 
Intramural 
Sports 

Building is an easy 
enough 
walk, 
but 

there is a ton of 
mental preparation 
that 
takes 
place 

before 
anyone 

swipes my Mcard. 
Anytime I go to the 
IM building, I put 
myself in a mood. I 
replay Cardi B and 
DMX in my head to 
get to a place where 
I feel slightly less awkward and 
misplaced entering the gym.

I, like many other people, 

have a mug when I go to the 
gym. I try to make myself look 
tough, to look like someone you 
don’t want to mess with.

My gym mug is completely 

different from any other facial 
expressions I make. People 
have a hard time believing 
that I can drive, so I’m used 
to trying to make myself seem 
less like a wide-eyed kid and 
more like an actual adult. I 
walk around campus with a 
straight face and tunnel vision, 
but when I go to the gym I take 
the look a bit farther.

Picture me, a 5-foot-4-inch 

skinny 
teenager, 
deadpan 

with a slight furrow in my 
brows. This creates a look 
meant to intimidate, but at its 
core is my sad attempt to look 
threatening, a way to show I 
know what I’m doing, even 
though I don’t. Anytime I 
step into a gym I mainly focus 
on making sure I don’t do 
something worth putting in a 
gym fail compilation.

I think that most people do 

some version of this when they go 
to a gym; I believe only a minority 
of 
society 
feels 
completely 

comfortable and confident every 
time they walk into a building and 
see weights, treadmills and other 
exercise equipment.

Those Planet Fitness 

commercials get it — 
“gymtimidation” 
is 

real and most people 
suffer from some form 
of it. I can’t help but 
constantly worry at 
the gym. I wonder if 
I’m doing the exercise 
I found on YouTube 
correctly. 
I 
wonder 

if this exercise looks 
stupid 
or 
weird. 
I 

wonder if I can lift this 

weight without a spotter and if I 
couldn’t, I wonder how loud and 
how embarrassing it would be if it 
fell. Most of all, I wonder if anyone 
caught on to the game of pretend I 
play and who will be the first to call 
me out.

If I’m going to get called 

out anywhere, it’s going to 
happen in the weight room. 
There I’m an easy target: I 
stick out because the space is 
dominated by guys and I look 
like I have no business there. 
I didn’t come with a weight 
belt and I’m not a muscular 
person. The weight rooms 
are my least favorite area of 
the gym and the whole place 
makes 
me 
uncomfortable. 

They have so many mirrors; 

they force you to confront 
yourself. 
You 
can’t 
stare 

blindly ahead like you would 
on a stationary bike or a 
treadmill, you have to squat 
and stare at your reflection.

I don’t want to stare at 

myself but I also don’t want 
to be forced to look at other 
people. That’s why going to the 
gym after 4 p.m. is one of my 
nightmares; I can’t function 
during peak time. After 4 p.m., 
using a machine becomes a 
challenge because there are 
so many people. Also, as more 
people lay claim to machines, 
grunt and pace around, the 
more insecure I get.

I know that this whole idea 

of mugging at the gym and the 
awkwardness and insecurity 
that comes with it is silly — I 
shouldn’t feel a need to justify 
my presence by making a 
face; I shouldn’t pretend like 
I belong. However, I do, and 
I don’t just do it when I go to 
the gym.

We all act a certain way to 

try to look a certain way to 
fit situations in life. Mostly, 
because we want acceptance 
or maybe because of imposter 
syndrome. 
But 
regardless, 

we shouldn’t ever have these 
concerns. I should walk into 
places and situations without 
so much concern about how I 
fit in and whether I stick out. 
I need to get more comfortable 
taking 
up 
space 
and 
get 

over deciding if I belong 
somewhere. My scrawny arms 
can use the bench press, I can 
use the squat rack — I don’t 
need to explain myself. Just 
like I don’t need to explain 
myself or justify my presence 
in any other situation I find 
myself in.

Diaries from the Chicago 
Int’l Film Festival: Day 4

My fourth day of the Chicago 

International 
Film 
Festival 

featured 
perhaps 
both 
the 

best and worst of what I’ll see 
here. At 3:45 p.m. was a press 
and 
industry 
screening 
of 

“The Confession,” the follow-
up to Georgian director Zaza 
Urushadze’s 
Oscar-nominated 

“Tangerines” from a few years 
back. “The Confession” follows 
a 
preacher, 
Giorgi 
(Dimitri 

Tatishvili, 
“Scary 
Mother”) 

and his assistant, Valiko (first-
timer Joseph Khvedelidze) as 
they fill in at a church in a town 
after the local preacher dies. 
They bring with them American 
DVDs and a projector to show 
in the church, believing that if 
the townspeople come for the 
movies, they’ll come to church.

The film series begins with 

“Some Like It Hot,” the 1959 
Billy 
Wilder 
classic 
with 

Marilyn 
Monroe, 
leading 
a 

number of the villagers to note 
that one of the women in the 
village, a music teacher named 
Lili 
(Sophia 
Sebiskveradze, 

“My Dad’s Girlfriend”), looks 
an awful lot like the blonde 
bombshell herself. And sure 
enough, though she is far from 
identical, Lili’s styled platinum 
blonde hair makes a compelling 
case. Lili and Father Giorgi 
become 
friendly, 
with 
the 

preacher encouraging her to 
come to a confession, where she 
notes not her sins but rather her 
place in the village: since her 
husband’s death, many men lust 
after her, but she’s not interested 
in loveless sex.

At about 89 minutes, the film 

moves fairly quickly, aided by 
an occasionally arresting shot. 
One of note happens a few 
times: Father Giorgi, out for an 
evening walk, finds a solitary 
Lili, illuminated and alluring, 
sitting aside a building in a 
large-scale shot. And there are 
some occasional laughs, too: 
One woman, concerned that 
her dead husband will know she 
cheated, asks Father Giorgi if 
spirits know everything. When 

he replies yes, she asks, “In 
detail?”

But when the film tries to 

actually say something, or make 
an argument, as Urushadze did 
with success in his previous 
film, “The Confession” sputters. 
The 
dichotomy 
between 

modern culture and religious 
traditions is present, but not 
dissected in any meaningful 
way. Father Giorgi went to film 
school, explaining his love of 
the medium, and dropped out to 
become a clergyman. So what? 
Father Giorgi feels torn between 
his lust and love for Lili and his 
promise to remain celibate. So 
what?

The cardinal sin, though, is 

the film’s finale. It would be 
unfair to ruin the “surprise,” but 
it should suffice that the film’s 
inclusion of a (false) female 
accusation of sexual assault 
is not only eerily repulsive 
given the recent scandal out of 
Hollywood involving producer 
Harvey Weinstein, but it also 
feeds a meninist nightmare to 
the point of propagandizing a 
vile hatred of women. I’m not 
one to dislike a movie for the 
ideas it depicts or proselytizes 
— hell, I’m a Jew who admires 
the craft of “The Triumph of 
the Will” — but Urushadze’s 
inclusion of the plot point, 
whether it was to articulate 
an idea or simply a method of 
moving the story forward, feels 
rather putrid.

“Lady 
Bird,” 
the 
solo 

directing 
debut 
of 
writer 

and 
actor 
Greta 
Gerwig 

(“20th Century Women”), is a 
fictionalized autiobiography. In 
other words, little to nothing 
that happens to high school 
senior Christine “Lady Bird” 
McPherson (an excellent Saoirse 
Ronan, 
“Brooklyn”) 
actually 

happened to Gerwig, but the 
film captures a spirit. Lady Bird, 
who gave herself the name, is an 
academically floundering and 
rebellious senior at a Catholic 
girls’ school in Sacramento. She 
dreams of going to college at an 
elite school on the east coast, but 
her family can hardly afford it 
(and her grades barely merit it). 
Roughly spanning the school 
year, we witness Lady Bird’s 

first loves, her experience in 
theater, parties, prom. Gerwig’s 
screenplay brilliantly swings 
between the heights of comedic 
achievement and the emotional 
caverns 
of 
anxiety, 
stress, 

growing up and everything else.

Films 
about 
adolescence 

often live or die by their casts. 
Fortunately, the actors behind 
“Lady Bird” are some of the 
most 
accomplished 
of 
their 

generation. 
Chicago 
theater 

legends Tracy Letts (“Wiener-
Dog”) 
and 
Laurie 
Metcalf, 

who just won a Tony for her 
performance in “A Doll’s House, 
Part 2,” are pitch-perfect as 
the parents of the household, 
navigating 
the 
struggles 
of 

raising a rebellious, sometimes 
insolent, daughter and grappling 
with their financial woes, and 
their 
Steppenwolf 
partner, 

Lois Smith (“The Nice Guys”), 
is authoritative and superbly 
funny as Lady Bird’s Catholic 
School’s mother superior. Lucas 
Hedges (“Manchester by the 
Sea”) and Timothée Chalamet 
(“Interstellar”), who play two of 
Lady Bird’s love interests, nail the 
sexual anxiety and performative 
coolness of youthful rebellion, 
respectively, better than any of 
their contemporaries. Beanie 
Feldstein 
(“Neighbors 
2: 

Sorority Rising”) is so funny as 
Lady Bird’s friend Julie that I 
actually snorted in the theater.

Gerwig, who has been the 

creative force behind a number 
of great films that explore 
the 
lives 
of 
rambunctious 

young women, has arrived as 
a director. She can keep her 
distance, letting characters live 
in the scene without a forceful 
intrusion of the camera. But 
she can also be tender, nailing 
dramatic moments with just 
as much force and ease as the 
comedy. Granted, a film that 
takes place in and is something 
of an ode to the writer-director’s 
hometown 
(in 
this 
case, 

Sacramento, Calif.) can often 
be good precisely because the 
filmmaker has spent so much 
time thinking about how to 
shoot the city. But “Lady Bird” is 
no standard debut and audiences 
should already anticipate what 
she has to offer next.

FESTIVAL REVIEW

HEALTH & WELLNESS COLUMN

The Alpha Female - Part I

I’m writing this from the 

Law Library, where every 
seat at my table is filled by a 
girl. Different races, ages and 
majors, various laptop stickers 
and textbooks — all of these 
girls are intensely studying 
and focused.

I’m empowered by this sight. 

Never at my time here at the 
University have I sat at only a 
table of women, with no words 
shared, but just studied and 
learned independently. They 
look tough and determined, 
and they make me want to be 
the same.

As an advocate for female 

empowerment and feminism, 
I’ve dabbled with the idea 
and definition of “the alpha 
female.” Seemingly, based off 
context clues, the girls around 
me sure look like they would 
be in this category. Those type 
of women exist, because the 
alpha male exists as well, so I 
could not help but soak up the 
divine feminine power around 
me and do some research.

From Dictionary.com, the 

definitions for alpha male 
and alpha female remarkably 
different. The alpha male is 
defined as both “a male animal 
having the highest rank in 
a 
dominance 
hierarchy” 

and “the leader of the pack, 
being 
the 
most 
dominant, 

powerful, or assertive person 
in a particular group.” Despite 
the word in terms of the 
animal kingdom, I found this 
definition to be appropriate for 
the human alpha male, with a 
nice use of characteristics 
like “highest rank,” “leader,” 
“dominant,” “powerful” and 
“assertive.” I had no suspicion 
in this definition, but it wasn’t 
until I searched my sex’s 
definition when things got 

frustrating.

The 
website 
gives 
two 

definitions 
and 
terms 
for 

what I was searching: alpha 
female and alpha girl. Alpha 

female is defined as “the 
dominant female animal in a 
pack,” meanwhile alpha girl 
is defined as “the dominant or 
primary girl within a group, 
esp. one who bullies.”

This boils my blood.
What is it about an alpha 

female that can’t be defined, 
like the alpha male, as “highest 
rank,” “leader,” “powerful” 
or “assertive”? We get two 
adjectives 
(dominant 
and 

primary) and a noun (bully), 
and they’re all crap.

In silence, I watch the 

women 
surrounding 
me, 

punching 
away 
at 
their 

keyboards, 
vigorously 

highlighting and memorizing, 
that are powerful and contain 
glimpses of qualities of alpha 
females. It’s these actions 
that demonstrate hard woman 
at work in a space that once 

did 
not 
allow 
women 
at 

all. Collectively, we paint a 
glorious image of taking back 
what is ours: the right to an 
education and the right to sit 
where we please.

It’s important to notice, 

also, the energy difference 
between a table of all woman 
and a table with all men and 
one woman. That one female is 
still strong in her own, being 
the representative for all of us 
in her scenario. But in most 
cases, that position can feel 
lonely or uncomfortable.

Yet the idea of these women 

and I sitting here, together, is 
evidently compelling –– we 
are dominant because we are 
together. I am comfortable, I 
am focused, I am invigorated 
by the idea that we’ve all sat 
here enriching our education 
and working our asses off for 
about four hours.

There was an unspoken 

supportive energy that was 
shared among us. It’s the same 
feeling I got when I used to 
practice with my women’s 
swim team, the same feeling I 
got when I walked through the 
Diag for the Women’s March 
and the same feeling I get 
every day when I come home 
to my house with six other 
female roommates. I believe 
women, especially those that 
are alpha females, emit an 
energy that is best received 
by other women. It’s those 
women that bring all of us 
together, reminding us of our 
place and our value.

If a boy sat down next to me, 

it wouldn’t make me or any 
of these women less of alpha 
females. We wouldn’t glare at 
him with hatred or disgust. 
We’d embrace it, recognizing 
that he belongs here equally as 
much as we do and vice versa.

No, maybe not all of these 

girls at the table are alpha 
females. 
They 
might 
not 

all lead their groups or are 
socially adept or rule with 
an iron fist. But who am I to 
say who is an alpha female 
and who is not? Clearly, there 
isn’t even a valid definition 
to prove any of this (thanks, 
Dictionary.com). I know one 
important 
thing, 
however: 

every 
female 
and 
every 

individual identifying as a 
female is strong in her own 
way. We sit here, individually 
in our own worlds and our 
own focus, but this table 
alone represents the future 
of supportive and successful 
females.

Author 
Vanessa 
Van 

Edwards 
gives 
her 
own 

definition of an alpha female: 
“Female alpha-hood is not 
like pregnancy (you are or 
you aren’t). It is more of a 
spectrum. Some women have 
a high tendency to be alpha. 
They enjoy social conducting, 
being the leader and/or the 
center 
of 
attention. 
Some 

women only like being female 
alpha’s in their home, but not 
in the business environment. 
Some women are only social 
alphas around certain groups 
of friends.”

One of my fellow female 

students at the table gets 
up to leave, when quickly, 
another 
girl 
replaces 
her 

spot. Hopefully, regardless of 
her alpha female-ness, she’s 
feeding into and receiving this 
same powerhouse energy that 
I feel. She replaced the seat 
of those before her, and she 
represents the future of strong 
women to come.

STUDENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW
‘One Hit Wonder’ brought breathtaking charm to AA

The minute I sat down in 

my seat I was captivated. I 
didn’t know what I expected: 
a production that described 
itself as a “pop / rock jukebox-
musical about music, love and 
second chances” was bound 
to be full of energy, nostalgic 
hits and blinding color. But the 
School of Music, Theatre and 
Dance’s “One Hit Wonder” was 
so much more.

“One Hit Wonder” is a story 

of 
high-school 
sweethearts 

Rick 
(played 
by 
Senior 

Musical Theatre major Noah 
Kieserman) and Ashley (played 
by 
Junior 
Musical 
Theatre 

major Leanne Antonio) who 
had a fleeting taste of fame in 
their teen years after winning 
Battle of the Bands at their 

high school. The song they 
composed, “One Hit Wonder,” 
is predictably at the heart of 
the entire musical plot. Their 
song is just that: the night after 
performing, Rick and Ashley 
break up and the band fizzles 
out. After leading separate lives 
for almost two decades, a video 
of Rick and Ashley singing their 
hit song goes viral, and both 
decide to take advantage of the 
second chance. Thus begins 
the whirlwind story of pride, 
heartbreak and rekindled love.

The musical is one of the 

newest creations of Jeremy 
Desmon, 
an 
award-winning 

musical 
theatre 
bookwriter 

whose previous works include 
“Good News” and “Pump Up 
The Volume,” both of which 
received rave reviews from 
the New York Times. “One 
Hit Wonder” was produced in 
collaboration with The Arca 
Group, an esteemed Broadway 

production company, and was 
directed by Hunter Foster, a 
graduate of the University’s 
SMTD and a Tony award-
nominated Broadway actor.

“One Hit Wonder” adds a 

cutesy twist to its plot –– each 
song performed was once a real 
one-hit wonder.

The 
opening 
act 
thrust 

its energy onto the stage so 
suddenly that the audience 
gasped. 
Rick, 
wearing 
the 

iconic Pink Floyd Dark Side of 
the Moon shirt, black jeans and 
an unbuttoned plaid shirt ran 
onto the stage, followed by his 
fans from the dive bar where 
he plays every night. His fans 
circled around the bottom of 
the stage while Rick, sweat 
already 
dripping 
down 
his 

face, belted out a high tempo 
rendition of “Closing Time,” 
originally performed by the 
American-rock band Semisonic 
in the late ’90s. Strobe lights 

flashed around the theatre, and 
Rick’s bassist Gunner (played 
by 
Musical 
Theatre 
major 

Elliott Styles) jammed with all 

the charisma of a rock star. By 
the time the number ended, I 

had been transported from the 
Lydia Mendelssohn theatre to a 
rock concert. It was hard to tell 
who was cheering more –– the 
actors playing Rick’s fans or 
the audience. And this level of 
passion and exuberance never 
died down.

The performance continued 

with a beautiful rendition of the 
famous “Walking on Sunshine,” 
originally performed by Katrina 
& The Waves, in which Ashley 
celebrated her new position 
as a partner of the Dunham, 
Parker & Lutz accounting firm. 
Her powerful voice stunned the 
audience; whoops and hollers 
sounded 
from 
the 
balcony 

above me. Ashley responded, 
dazzling the audience with 
her liveliness. Right before 
the 
intermission, 
a 
slowed 

down and somber rendition 
of 
“Rescue 
Me,” 
originally 

performed by Fontella Bass, 
provided a perfect break from 

the exhilarating first half.

The real genius of “One Hit 

Wonder” lies in the humor. 
Actors performed the classic 
“What is Love?” by Haddaway 
after the intermission with a 
clever spin. Stewart, Ashley’s 
ex-boyfriend 
(played 
by 

Musical Theatre major Simon 
Longnight) 
lamented 
the 

loss of his girlfriend. Ashley, 
dressed in sweats and clasping 
a beer bottle, fumed about 
Rick’s hook-up with pop singer 
Mercy Faith, played by Musical 
Theatre major Grace Bydalek. 
Rick, shirtless and handcuffed 
to a bed frame by Mercy, belted 
out in a panic, “Baby don’t 
hurt me / Don’t hurt me / No 
more.” The interplay of these 
three scenarios, all occuring 
at the same time but meaning 
very different things, had the 
audience roaring with laughter.

It’s rare to find a musical that 

excels like “One Hit Wonder.”

COMEDY CENTRAL

What ‘Broad City’ gets 
right about depression

“Broad City” has been back for 

its fourth season for a little over a 
month, and the season might be its 
best yet. Creators and stars Abbi 
Jacobson (“Portlandia”) and Ilana 
Glazer (“Rough Night”) know their 
show’s past well, often winking 
to moments in previous seasons, 
but they don’t let their characters 
remain stagnant.

Abbi was working as an assistant 

to an ad executive (hilariously 
played by Wanda Sykes (“Bad 
Moms”)) 
before 
getting 
fired 

in a shrooms-related incident. 
Ilana gets a job in an upscale 
sushi restaurant, managed by 
Marcel (Ru Paul, “Ru Paul’s Drag 
Race”), where she is making the 
most money she’s ever had. Each 
character also loses some baggage 
from 
previous 
seasons: 
Ilana 

reached closure with Lincoln in 
a bathroom after shitting herself; 
Abbi left things on a positive note 
with Trey after training Shania 
Twain (yet another amazing guest 
star) and breaking his penis. And 
even though the show isn’t saying 
Trump’s name audibly, this season 
— the first to take place in winter, 
and under Trump’s administration 
— doesn’t shy away from the 
current state of affairs. In one 
episode, the pair escorts women in 
and out of a Planned Parenthood, 
eventually blowing a vape cloud 
into the face of an angry protester, 
thus changing his view on the 

topic (obviously). In another, Ilana 
complains about the decreasing 
quality of cell reception and 
subway service since “becoming a 
fascist state.”

None of this is especially new 

for the show as it has leaned 
into the woke, white-girl stoner 
sitcom we know it as today, but 
“Broad City” took its approach 
to new levels last week, devoting 
almost 
an 
entire 
episode 
to 

Ilana’s struggle with depression. 
Titled “Abbi’s Mom,” the episode 
opens with Abbi preparing for 
a visit from her mother while 
Ilana struggles to overcome her 
mounting depression, made worse 
by Seasonal Affective Disorder.

Ilana is struggling to give Abbi 

her attention, sitting quiet and 
distant before turning on her SAD 
lamp and popping back into her 
signature boisterous style. She has 
been steadily lowering her dosage 
of antidepressants (a goal she set 
in the second season’s finale) and is 
relying on the SAD lamp to make it 
through the winter.

The remainder of the episode 

plays out while Abbi and her mom 
(Peri Gilpin, “Fraiser”) dine at 
Sushi Mambeaux, where Marcel 
has cancelled the evening’s tips 
pool and promises to fire the server 
who earns the least and give all the 
tips to the server who earns the 
most. Emphasizing how depression 
doesn’t care about or stop for life, 
even when your job is on the line, 
Ilana spends half of her shift in a 
storage closet hugging her SAD 
lamp and the other half struggling 
to make it through customer 

interactions.

The show’s approach conveys 

the 
experience 
of 
crippling 

depression so well by taking the 
internal symptoms and placing 
them in plain view. Through 
special effects, scenes where Ilana 
is struggling to do her duties play 
out the overwhelming feeling of a 
depressive episode — that feeling 
of being slightly removed from 
your present — shown by slight 
slow-mo and the echoing of her 
customer’s requests. My therapist 
uses the metaphor of walking 
through peanut butter to visualize 
the struggle of everyday life 
with depression, but this episode 
acknowledges that sometimes you 
aren’t only walking through peanut 
butter, 
but 
sometimes 
you’re 

swimming through it, using all of 
your mental will power to move, 
breathe and exist.

As her shift progresses, Ilana 

has to up the intensity of her SAD 
lamp, lining the closet with tin foil, 
bringing in the kitchen’s meat lamp 
and finally switching to a higher 
wattage bulb. When Abbi swaps the 
bulb, Ilana slowly rises out of a fetal 
position, relishing in the lamp’s 
sweet relief. But as is with most 
ineffective coping mechanisms, 
all the time and energy put into it 
is a waste, as they blow one of the 
restaurant’s fuses. Band-Aid fixes 
to depression — or any mental 
health problem — feel good in the 
moment but won’t change your 
situation, as exemplified by Ilana’s 
lamp.

St. Vincent straddles the 
coasts in her latest record

St. Vincent is a fabrication. 

It’s a creation slowly built 
and carved by Annie Clark, a 
project that came to resemble 
a human but wasn’t entirely 
meant to be. The name itself 
suggests the unreal, like the 
abstraction taken from an icon, 
a wistful sense 
of the holy that 
never was and 
isn’t still. That 
it’s Annie’s face 
which 
graces 

the cover of over 
half St. Vincent’s 
studio albums is beside the 
point: They share the same face, 
but St. Vincent is the image, 
Annie the person. Clark likes 
to play with that line between 
the persona and the person, 
but no matter how sweetly 
she has danced between the 
two, she still makes it known 
that it’s a performance. That 
creation has been her appeal 
to universality, and her Chloes 
and Johnnys, her “You”s and 
“I”s are all characters in this 
world building. 

On 
MASSEDUCTION, 

her fifth album, the tension 
between 
Annie 
and 
St. 

Vincent dominates. It means 
everything and still it’s more 
unclear 
than 
ever 
before. 

That’s St. Vincent on stage 
bemoaning the seduction of 
the masses. There’s the created 
image fearing the future. And 
yet, when we move beyond the 
plastic surgery she both mocks 
coyly and wears herself, there’s 
an unflagging clarity that feels 
new.

Never 
has 
she 
made 
a 

song like “New York.” Never 
has she felt so naked; never 
has 
her 
songwriting 
been 

so simply beautiful, so free 
of alien metaphor, straight-
talking yet poetic all the same. 
Here, she sings to a friend 
about definitions, about what 
a 
city 
means 
when 
those 

who made it everything are 
gone. Loss is consuming on 
MASSEDUCTION.

“New York” is the heart of 

this album, and so is the city. 
This is an album of love within 
a disease — within powerful 
addictions 
and 
temptations 

that rip people apart. And when 
she’s talking about love, she’s 
talking about New York. Her 
relationships mold that city, 
and when she walks through 

Time Square with her friend in 
“Happy Birthday, Johnny,” the 
loss she feels in the tear of that 
friendship is inexorably tied to 
those buildings. She sings him 
happy New Year and the ball 
drops for them both, far apart 
as they may be.

When she’s on the other 

coast, 
she’s 
singing 
about 

longing too, but it’s more 

lustful there, and 
a bit cheeky. On 
“Los 
Ageless,” 

she’s grinning at 
the 
superficial 

desires of that 
city. It’s a story 
of 
wants 
in 

Hollywood, this dying yearn for 
youthful perfection that will 
forever remain unattainable: 
“How can anybody have you? 
/ How can anybody have you 
and lose you?” That song and 
that city are a degree separated 
from 
reality. 
Los 
Ageless 

isn’t a place, and whoever or 
whatever you take the “you” 
as, it’s gone regardless. Like 
that illusion, the song itself 
is overly concocted, complete 
with the ’80s drum pattern 
and synths signature of pop 
producer Jack Antonoff, who 
co-produced this album. This 
formula appears all throughout 
MASSEDUCTION, and it can 
be relentless in its forced smile. 
Of course that’s the point, but 
it can make for a less than 
gratifying listen. “Los Ageless” 
never really goes anywhere. It 
hardly wavers from the straight 
line laid out by its chorus.

We can read the tension 

between St. Vincent and Annie 
Clark 
through 
the 
tension 

between 
the 
two 
coasts, 

and this album rides these 
two 
modes: 
She 
alternates 

between the plastic of San 
Bernardino and the wrought 
confessional of the concrete 
jungle. Loneliness and loss 
move between these coasts, 
certainly, but the separation 
between the cities defines how 
she processes these feelings. In 
New York she looks inwards; in 
Los Angeles she looks outwards 
(and 
isn’t 
too 
impressed). 

MASSEDUCTION is very much 
about flying between them.

The stretch from “Pills” 

to “Los Ageless” is that West 
coast concern for the outward. 
The seductions she tackles 
are broader and more of the 
masses, as the album title 
suggests. 
There 
aren’t 
the 

hyper-specific moments we get 

on the tracks about New York, 
like that hotel room where 
Johnny lights up his Bic lighter 
in “Happy Birthday, Johnny.” 
Instead we have abstractions; 
in the title track she sings of 
“A punk rock romantic” and 
“Nuns in stress position.” On 
“Pills,” she dances to a chipper 
club beat while describing a 
pill-induced haze that could 
be anyone’s. She sounds almost 
celebratory, and she gets away 
with it because she’s right 
there in it too, seduced by the 
drugs and technology herself. 
She avoids what easily could 
have been a gratingly haughty 
tone.

This slew of songs is the 

most upbeat on the album, 
and St. Vincent hardly lets up 
the guise. They’re interesting 
thought experiments, but they 
can grow a bit tiresome as they 
push farther in the album, 
almost 
monotonous. 
When 

that sound reappears as late as 
“Fear the Future,” it’s nearly 
exhausting. It’s what makes 
those New York tracks so 
stunning, such breaths of fresh 
air among all the sickness.

For a while we’re not sure 

whether the two sides of this 
album will ever truly meet: 
drug- and sex- fueled nights 
lead into confessionals without 
a clear sense of narrative. It’s 
not until the end that we see 
MASSEDUCTION as a single 
story, on the closing track, 
“Smoking Section.” The song 
is an absolute triumph. It 
brings the unresolved ends 
to light, and the apparent 
contradictions are explained. 
St. Vincent draws a sketch of 
someone on the edge, someone 
who sees how easily it could 
all burst into flames and kind 
of likes it, maybe wants it to 
happen. “Let it happen,” she 
sings. And yet she doesn’t. 
By the end she decides, “It’s 
not the end,” though it very 
well could have been. The 
track moves slowly, explodes, 
recoils and does it all over, like 
the turns this album makes 
track by track. It’s a glam 
rock ballad about pop suicide, 
which she contemplates like 
a dark game on her stage, 
waiting for someone to light 
her up. But she doesn’t want to 
step over that edge. She stays 
behind it, toying with her own 
destruction, reveling in the 
seduction all the same.

Hua bests teammate Knight to capture 
singles title at ITA Midwest Regionals

This weekend, the Michigan 

men’s tennis team hosted this 
year’s edition of the ITA Midwest 
Regionals with a bid to the 2017 
ITA Fall Championships at stake.

In the quarterfinals, Michigan 

senior Alex Knight, ranked 51st 
nationally, faced off against Ohio 
State freshman John McNally 
with a chance at a spot in the 
semifinals. McNally was the No. 
1 recruit in the nation coming 
out of high school and played in 
three of four junior Grand Slams 
before entering the Buckeyes’ 
freshman class, making it as far 
as the Round of 16 at Wimbledon 
and the doubles quarterfinals at 
the French Open.

Knight, a former blue-chip 

recruit ranked as high as No. 
5 nationally, fought well in the 
most high-profile match in the 
tournament.

With the majority of the men’s 

team out in early rounds, Knight 
struggled at first against the 
talented Ohio State freshman, 
with all attempts to break serve 
thwarted. He faced a break of 
his serve in the first set’s game 
four but managed to stave off 
McNally. 
Knight 
regained 

momentum and broke McNally 
in the eighth game, eventually 
taking the set, 6-4. Knight’s 
second set was remarkably easy, 
as he stomped to a 6-1 set victory 
to take the match.

Knight’s teammates, senior 

Runhao 
Hua 
and 
freshman 

Mattias Siimar, also faced tough 
competition in the quarterfinals. 
Hua was pitted against No. 
104 Alex Lebedev, who had 
previously made the doubles 
semifinals in the tournament. 
Hua jumped out to a first set 
lead, winning 6-4, but struggled 
early in the second set against 
Lebedev. He fell behind 1-3, 
before ultimately dropping the 

set 3-6. But in the third set, 
Hua broke his opponent early 
and took a commanding 3-0 
lead, ultimately resulting in a 
dominant set and match, which 
ended 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.

Siimar 
came 
up 
against 

an 
eventual 
semifinalist 
in 

Ohio State’s Martin Joyce. He 
took the first set 7-6, despite 
some controversy with calls 
overturned by the court umpire. 
Siimar had a chance to break 
and take the second set at 6-5, 
but he was unable to muster 
the points. The second set went 
to a relatively uncompetitive 
tiebreaker, 
with 
Joyce 

dominating 6-7 (3) and taking 
the set.

After two grueling sets, Siimar 

managed to get an early break on 
Joyce, but nothing materialized 
out of the positive momentum, 
and the third set ultimately 
resulted in a 2-6 thrashing with 
the match point sealed on an 

unfortunate net foul.

“I’m thrilled, but we obviously 

wanted three (in the semifinals),” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Adam 

Steinberg. “Alex had a great win 
against (McNally), one of the best 
of his career.”

Both 
Alex 
Knight 
and 

teammate 
Runhao 
Hua 

progressed to the semifinals, and 
ultimately faced each other in the 
singles final. Hua took the final 
and the title, 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4).

Both Knight and Hua also 

competed together in doubles 
and managed to progress to the 
final against Wisconsin’s duo 
of Chema Carranza and Josef 
Dodridge. Together, Hua and 
Knight had played in about a 
dozen matches previously, and 
the physical toll showed on 
the court against the Badgers. 
The Wolverines jumped out 
to a strong 7-5 first set victory, 
but they could not put away 
their challengers. They were 

broken early in the second set 
and the Badgers duo served 
out the second set comfortably, 
winning 3-6. In the final frame 
of the doubles final, the tension 
increased and each duo broke 
serve points and dropped served 
points, but the Badgers managed 
to pull out a 10-12 victory and the 
doubles title for Wisconsin.

Steinberg said Monday that it 

was a great performance for the 
team and that it was especially 
good to gain experience against 
both national and international 
players who compete in major 
tournaments on a global stage.

“Our guys need to experience 

that as much as possible,” he said.

The 
Wolverines 
managed 

to secure one title, and they 
will take away a wealth of 
experience against conference 
rivals 
and 
other 
nationally-

ranked competitors that will 
only further prepare them for 
conference play in January.

WOMEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ keeps season alive

Just after they were honored for 

Senior Night on Saturday, seven 
Wolverine seniors took the field 
knowing it could be the last home 
game of their collegiate careers. 

Coming off a three-game losing 

streak, the Michigan women’s 
soccer team knew one loss would 
eliminate it from a Big Ten 
Tournament spot.

The game got off to an 

inconspicuous start for both teams. 
Both teams had scoring chances, 
but neither managed to find the 
back of the net.

And with eight minutes to go in 

the first half, frustrations boiled 
over, as fifth-year senior midfielder 
Ani Sarkisian got into a fight with 
an Illinois player.

The incident didn’t seem to 

have a tangible effect at first. Both 
players were issued yellow cards 
and play resumed. But it seemed 
to give Michigan a spark, as soon 
afterward, it caught fire. While the 
two teams were tied at halftime in 
shots and fouls, in the second half, 
the Wolverines (2-4-3 Big Ten, 
5-5-6 overall) looked dominant, 
holding Illinois (2-7-0, 5-12-0) 
to just three shots the rest of the 
game en route to a 3-0 victory. 

“We regrouped in the locker 

room and realized … if we wanted 
to win this game we had to give 100 
percent,” Sarkisian said. “We went 
out there and got the job done.”

Michigan’s 
aggressiveness 

in the second half paid off. In 
the game’s 69th minute, junior 
midfielder Abby Kastroll took the 
ball downfield into the penalty 
area on a breakaway. Junior 
forward Reilly Martin did the 
rest, knocking one past the Illinois 
goalkeeper from 12 yards out.

In 
that 
moment, 
senior 

goalkeeper Sarah Jackson put her 
hands up in celebration from the 
other end of the field as the ball 
sailed into the opposing net.

Jackson’s gesture was both a 

celebration and a signal to her team 
to not let up.

“Next five minutes, don’t let 

down. If you let down, you give the 
other team a chance to get right 
back in,” Jackson said. “We’ve been 
waiting for that breakthrough.”

“Our main goal was to try and 

attack as much as we could,” said 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan. “We 
knew a tie wouldn’t do us any good, 
so our focus was just to go after 
them. As the game went along, we 
really caught our stride. Tonight 
was the first night where I thought 
… there was just a consistent level 
of understanding connection and 
attacking.”

Not long after, Michigan was 

awarded a penalty kick after 
an Illinois handball infraction. 
Sarkisian took the kick — and 
promptly scored to give her team 
crucial breathing room with a two-
goal lead.

And with just 30 seconds 

remaining in the game, Kastroll 
again 
snuck 
through 
on 
a 

breakaway with no defenders in 
sight and scored another goal, 
putting the finishing touches on an 
incredibly important win for the 
Wolverines. 

The Fighting Illini countered 

with an opportunity of their own, 
but Jackson fell on it just as time 
expired, securing the shutout for 
her team. One would have to go 
back to September to find the last 
time the Wolverines got a shutout, 
in a 0-0 draw with Wake Forest.

“Getting (the shutout),” Jackson 

said, “was really special.” 

For 
Jackson 
and 
fellow 

senior goalkeeper Megan Hinz, 
combining for the shutout on 
Senior Night made the night feel 
even more special.

“Sarah 
and 
I 
have 
been 

training together for four years 
and you couldn’t ask for a better … 
teammate,” Hinz said. “To be able 
to share this with her is just unreal.”

With a win against Rutgers next 

week needed for the chance at a 
spot in the Big Ten Tournament, 
Hinz feels the team is finally 
clicking at the right time.

“We’re meshing really well,” 

she said. “We’re having fun but 
working so hard, and I think we’re 
in a good place to give it our all.” 

FIELD HOCKEY
No. 4 Michigan takes 
down No. 7 Louisville

After clinching the regular 

season Big Ten championship, 
the No. 4 Michigan field hockey 
team continued its season-long 
string of success against elite 
competition by beating No. 7 
Louisville, 6-2.

The Wolverines, who haven’t 

lost since Sept. 8, wasted no 
time showing the fans at the 
Marshall Center which of the 
two postseason-bound squads 
was the superior one.

Two minutes into the game, 

the 
Cardinals’ 
goalkeeper 

Ayeisha 
McFerran 
deflected 

senior 
midfielder 
Katie 

Trombetta’s 
corner 
shot, 

but 
freshman 

defender 
Halle 

O’Neill recovered 
the rebound and 
shot the ball into 
the 
bottom 
of 

the goal. Two of 
the Wolverines’ 
three goals in the 
first half resulted 
from 
penalty 

corners in which Michigan took 
advantage of the chaos in the 
Louisville defense to score.

“Both of my assists were off 

two corners,” Trombetta said. “I 
think that they were both great 
corner calls from the coaches, 
and on the first one, Halle did 
a great job of just staying low 
and getting to the ball no matter 
what.”

The Wolverines scored three 

times on goalkeeper-deflected 
balls, including a goal by Emma 
Way in the 10th minute. The 
junior forward danced her way 
through a crowd of Cardinals 
defenders 
in 
the 
box 
and 

waltzed right past Louisville’s 
goalkeeper for an easy finish.

Louisville 
wasn’t 
able 
to 

find much success against the 
Michigan back line. Although 
the Wolverines allowed two 
goals — above their season 
average of 0.81 allowed per 

game — one came after three 
consecutive penalty corners.

“They just played with a lot 

of heart and they defended 
really 
well,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Marcia Pankratz. “Their 
transition from attack to defense 
and vice versa was excellent. 
They lead hard, double team 
hard for each other and did all 
those little things that matter.”

Arguably the best of the six 

goals of the game occurred in 
the 40th minute. Trombetta 
streaked down the field and 
fired a pass toward the stick of 
fifth-year senior forward Carly 
Bennett. But rather than picking 
her stick up, the forward laid 
her stick down, angled it slightly 

upwards 
and 

didn’t 
move. 

The 
result 
— 

much like many 
of 
Michigan’s 

shots Sunday — 
was a score.

“That’s 

actually a play 
that the corner 
offense 
has 

been practicing 
for 
a 
while,” 

Bennett said. “We kind of 
established that that would be 
an open play in this game. We’ve 
been practicing it a lot, and 
Katie’s shooting has been really 
on for us lately. She scored the 
winning goal at Northwestern, 
so all of us as a corner unit were 
saying ‘Do this exactly how we 
practiced.’ Katie set me up with 
the perfect pass, and it worked.”

While the game did not have 

any regular season implications 
for the Wolverines, Michigan 
faced a Louisville foe akin to 
many of the elite teams it may 
see in the postseason.

“It’s always great to play a good 

team like Louisville,” Pankratz 
said. “There are still things we 
want to improve on before the 
tournament starts next weekend. 
They’re also an in-region team, 
so beating another team in our 
region certainly helps us for the 
NCAA Tournament.”

Series takeaways: Underclassmen rise to 
occasion, power play struggles continue

Following an opening weekend 

split, the Michigan hockey team 
(3-1) came back from a short break 
with newfound energy, going 
on to sweep Vermont (2-3) this 
weekend with 4-1 and 3-2 victories 
on Friday and Saturday night, 
respectively. The Daily highlights 
four key takeaways from the series, 
including the areas the Wolverines 
excelled and the areas the team 
needs to improve before Michigan 
travels to Penn State for its first Big 
Ten series of the season. 

Underclassmen 
steadily 

rising to the occasion

In Friday night’s home opener, 

freshman forward Josh Norris 
scored two goals to put the game 
out of reach. Fewer than 24 hours 
later, sophomore forward Jake 
Slaker converted two of his own 
to complete a comeback victory 
over the Catamounts and the 
Wolverines’ first weekend sweep 
of the season.

Michigan’s average age of 20 

years and 324 days is the third 
youngest in Division I. But that 
doesn’t stop the underclassmen 
from stepping up, and it doesn’t 
stop coach Mel Pearson from 
depending 
on 
them 
in 
big 

moments.

“We’re relying on sophomores 

and freshmen and a few seniors 
to lead us,” Pearson said following 
Saturday’s matchup.

Through solid and consistent 

play from the likes of Slaker, 
Norris, 
sophomore 
forward 

Will Lockwood and freshman 
defenseman Quinn Hughes, the 
youngsters look to be guiding 
the team — a silver-lining to 
the obvious issue of certain 
upperclassmen underperforming 
thus far in the season.

Power 
play 
struggles 

continue

Though the Wolverines eked 

out two wins this weekend, their 
inability to capitalize on the power 
play persists. After going 2-for-5 

with a man advantage in its first 
regular season game against St. 
Lawrence, Michigan has gone a 
collective 0-for-17 on the power 
play in its last three contests.

For a team that finished 17th 

nationally on the power play 
just last year, the Wolverines 
went 0-for-9 this weekend and 
surrendered a shorthanded goal to 
Vermont in Friday’s slate.

While Pearson has stressed 

special teams early in the season, 
the coach admitted that continuing 
to emphasize power plays in 
practice will be crucial to the 
team’s success moving forward.

“We need to simplify things,” 

Pearson said. “We get a little too 
cute and don’t get many shots. … 
We need to move the puck quicker 
and get in sync a little bit. We were 
a little out of sync, but that’s up to 
me and that’s my responsibility 
and we’ve got enough good players 
and skill players, so we should be 
converting. But we’ll get there.”

Strong 
goaltending 
keeps 

Wolverines in contests

With three goals allowed this 

weekend, 
sophomores 
Hayden 

Lavigne and Jack LaFontaine 
proved that Michigan has a sturdy 
backbone.

Most notably, Lavigne notched 

his first win for the Wolverines in 
a 28-save performance Saturday.

The two goaltenders, who are 

splitting time for the first eight 
games of the season, boasted a 
total 43 saves with a .936 average 
save percentage over the weekend.

“Two good goalies in both 

Hayden and Jack,” said sophomore 
forward Adam Winborg. “… As long 
as we do our job in front of them, 
they’re there, so they’ll always give 
us a chance to win the games.”

While the Wolverines’ defense 

allowed just 16 and 30 shots Friday 
and Saturday, respectively, the 
duo still wasn’t fazed, making 
both routine and clever saves in 
the crease to ensure Michigan 
victories.

Early roadblocks appear late 

in games

During Friday night’s matchup, 

the Wolverines let 16 shots fly 
in the first period, none of them 

finding the back of the net. They 
came back with another 16 in the 
second period, this time with two 
goals to show for it — albeit late in 
the period.

On Saturday, Michigan took 

15 shots in the first and second 
periods combined, with only one 
goal to show for it.

What seemed like such high-

octane starts to both games still 
didn’t give the Wolverines a 
dominant grip on the match.

However, the four combined 

goals in the third periods of both 
matchups proved that Michigan 
offense’s relentless pursuit of the 
net takes time, but is ultimately 
lethal.

“I’m happy for them,” Pearson 

said. “It’s good they get rewarded 
for staying with the game plan and 
hanging in there. And our third 
periods have been pretty good this 
year so far.”

Going 
up 
against 
stronger 

opponents, though, the Wolverines 
will have to net these shots early if 
they want momentum on its side 
when it matters most.

Peters improving, but O’Korn 
the starter for the Wolverines

The plan was for Brandon 

Peters to get the ball in garbage 
time.

With just over three minutes 

remaining 
in 
the 
blowout 

Saturday 
night, 
Penn 
State 

took over possession. Backup 
quarterback 
Tommy 
Stevens 

kept the ball for an 11-yard rush 
on the first play of the series. The 
ball came free, and Michigan 
seemingly recovered the fumble. 
Upon further review, though, 
Stevens was ruled down, and the 
Nittany Lions killed the clock 
from there.

On Monday afternoon, Jim 

Harbaugh said that if the call had 
not been overturned, Michigan’s 
redshirt freshman quarterback 
would have led the Wolverines’ 
final offensive series.

That doesn’t mean much, 

if anything at all. Harbaugh 
said 
nothing 
Monday 
that 

would suggest fifth-year senior 
John O’Korn is no longer the 
Wolverines’ starter.

“I won’t go into everything, but 

he managed the game very well, 
got everything communicated, 
ran the offense 
very 
well,” 

Harbaugh 
said 

of 
O’Korn’s 

performance 
at Penn State. 
“There was some 
duress and some 
plays 
that 
we 

could have made, 
et cetera. (We’ll) 
go back and look 
at it. That’s what 
we’re 
in 
the 

process of doing. (There was) 
some good, kind of a theme for 
our offense. There were some 
(missed opportunities) out there 
as well.”

The outside clamor for Peters 

has escalated throughout the 
year, and the 42-13 loss to the 
Nittany Lions — a game in which 

O’Korn averaged six yards per 
attempt with a fumble — has 
pushed that din to excess.

Harbaugh did say Peters has 

been improving since he began 
taking backup snaps in the wake 
of redshirt junior quarterback 
Wilton Speight’s injury.

But based on Harbaugh’s 

comments, the clamor is just 
that. While the 
progress is there, 
the starting job 
— as the situation 
currently stands 
— is not.

For Peters to 

see time on the 
field this year, 
it appears that 
Michigan 
will 

need to establish 
comfortable 
leads 
or 
find 
itself 
in 

insurmountable 
deficits. 
And 

with an offense that ranks 
98th in pass offense, that first 
hypothetical does not fall in the 
redshirt freshman’s favor.

As 
for 
the 
players’ 
own 

outlook, there is no discrepancy.

“Kind of a little tidbit from 

Coach Harbaugh, I don’t like 
to 
compare 
people 
because 

someone 
gets 

demoted in the 
comparison,” 
said 
junior 

wide 
receiver 

Grant 
Perry. 

“But 
they’re 

both great guys; 
they’re 
both 

great 
leaders. 

But Brandon is 
learning 
from 

John and John 
is learning from 

Brandon, and that’s just kind of 
the scheme of things — people 
learning from each other.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

fullback Henry Poggi: “Brandon’s 
been developing really well. I 
remember when he came in for 
spring ball his freshman year. 
He’s just really grown from 

there. He’s going to be a really 
good player for us.”

The quarterback controversy, 

of course, is not new. Speight 
faced his fair share of criticism 
prior to sustaining a hit against 
Purdue on Sept. 23 that left him 
with three cracked vertebrae.

Harbaugh never confirmed 

that the injury would rule Speight 

out 
for 
the 

season, but did 
address Speight’s 
status 
Monday 

afternoon, 
drawing from his 
own experience 
in 
1984 
when 

he 
missed 
an 

entire 
season 

after 
breaking 

his arm against 
Michigan State.

“First 
and 
foremost, 
get 

healthy,” Harbaugh said. “That’s 
where you concentrate most 
of your efforts. That’s where 
most of his efforts are being 
concentrated. 
Every 
single 

minute of the day he’s getting 
treatment they tell me, the 
doctors and trainers. He’s at 
practice; I know he’s chomping 
at the bit. The bones healing back 
together, that takes time.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

running back Ty Isaac: “I talk 
to (Wilton) all the time. (He’s) 
just dealing with an injury like 
anybody else would. You’ve gotta 
rehab and work to get back, and 
I know how bad he wants to 
keep playing right now, so I don’t 
think his spirits are diminished 
at all. He’s got a task at hand right 
now, even though it’s not playing 
for us, it’s getting healthy so he 
can get back on the field.”

Whether Speight does get 

back on the field this season 
remains to be seen.

And until then, the outside 

noise will continue to surround 
the 
man 
under 
center 
for 

the 
Wolverines. 
But 
taking 

Harbaugh’s 
comments 
into 

consideration, it’s just noise.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Fifth-year senior quarterback John O’Korn’s job is not in question after the blowout according to coach Jim Harbaugh. 

Bushell-Beatty finding his place 

Two Saturdays ago, redshirt 

junior offensive lineman Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty came off the bench 
against Michigan State. 

The Wolverines were trailing 

14-3, and nothing was going right 
for Michigan’s offensive line.

Redshirt 
sophomore 
Nolan 

Ulizio started at right tackle, and 
he continued to get beat. The 
Spartans’ larger, more physical 
defensive front kept pounding 
at Ulizio, and Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh saw that it was 
necessary to bring on a substitute.

Enter Bushell-Beatty.
Sure enough, Michigan State got 

another sack just a few drives later. 
Michigan’s offensive line couldn’t 
hold off the Spartans’ pressure, 
and over the course of that game, 
fifth-year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn was sacked four times.

Saturday night at No. 2 Penn 

State, 
the 
problem 
persisted: 

O’Korn was sacked seven times.

The offensive line has been 

penetrable 
against 
ranked 

opponents this season, but there is 
one area in which it has grown.

It finally found its fifth man. The 

right tackle position had gone back 
and forth all season. Sometimes 
Ulizio played, sometimes Bushell-
Beatty came in, and other times 
redshirt 
junior 
Jon 
Runyan 

entered the fray.

But since coming off the bench 

against Michigan State, Bushell-
Beatty has started in every game. 
Still, the switch hasn’t kept O’Korn 
upright. 

“He’s in there playing, being 

available, 
being 
durable,” 

Harbaugh said. “(Bushell-Beatty’s) 
play has improved, and striving to 
be even better.”

Harbaugh said that he wouldn’t 

use the word “well” to describe 
the offensive line’s performance 
against Penn State — after all, 
the team lost. But there were 
components of the line’s play he 
thought were good nonetheless.

“After watching the tape, the line 

played very physical,” Harbaugh 
said. “Their performance had 

some really good things and some 
things we’d like to have done 
better. Juwann, being part of that 
line, I really thought he matched 
up physically and really fought 
hard.”

Bushell-Beatty’s 
consistency 

is one of those “good things” that 
Harbaugh talked about.

One advantage Bushell-Beatty 

has over many of his teammates is 
experience. It’s his fourth season 
with the team. He redshirted the 
year that Michigan went 5-7 in 
2014. Though he wasn’t playing 
that year, he learned how valuable 
it is to face and overcome adversity.

Now 
that 
Michigan 
has 

suffered its second loss of the 
season, Bushell-Beatty hopes his 
teammates can embrace the same 
mindset that he did a few years ago.

“Although we may not want to 

learn through (a loss), it can teach 
us a lot,” Bushell-Beatty said. “It 
helps you shape yourself as a player. 
Winning every game doesn’t really 
teach you anything.

“It may be nice, but when you 

learn from losing games and 
trying to come back from upsets 

and disappointing events in your 
season, it teaches you to refocus 
and re-compartmentalize what 
you have in mind.”

Bushell-Beatty found that all 

out early in his career, and now 
he’s seeing it all again. A Big 
Ten championship and a spot in 
the College Football Playoff — 
Michigan’s goals at the start of the 
year — won’t come without outside 
help.

“Things aren’t necessarily in 

our hands anymore,” Bushell-
Beatty said.

But the Wolverines need to 

play as if their fate still is in their 
hands. Bushell-Beatty took on that 
mentality individually four years 
ago, and the dividends are just 
starting to show.

He’s getting more playing time 

than ever and improving each 
week.

He relishes the fact that the 

outcome may not always turn out 
the way he wants.

“I want it to be a challenge,” 

Bushell-Beatty said. “I don’t want 
everything to be handed to me that 
easily.”
