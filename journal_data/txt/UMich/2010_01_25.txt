PATROLLNG CAMPUS POLICE
For problems
with DPS, a
choice of two
distinct paths

Lieutenant Carl Hein of the Ann Arbor Fire Department shows where a team of firefighters threw a burning mattress out the window of a room in Baits I yesterday.
After microwave mishap starts
fire,

Depending on
how one files a case,
outcome could have
different implications
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
The main function of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety Oversight
Committee is to make sure campus
police officers are acting in accor-
dance with internal policies and
state laws governing their actions.
The committee does this by
addressing citizens' grievances
against campus police officers and
making recommendations to Uni-
versity officials so that action can be
taken to amend a situation and pre-
vent it from happening again.
When someone has a problem
with DPS, campus policy dictates
that acitizenhastwo options totake
action: file a complaint with DPS
itself or file a grievance with the
DPS Oversight Committee.
A grievance is essentially the
same thing as a complaint, except
that a different body handles the
case.
When a citizen files a complaint,
DPS officials handle the investiga-
tion themselves, and the oversight

committee is only notified about it
when it's completed. On the other
hand, if a citizen files a grievance
with the oversight committee, there
is a possibility that top University
officials could review the grievance.
While a DPS officer may be pun-
ished as a result of a complaint, Uni-
versity executives have the power
to change policies to try to prevent
a similar-incident from occurringin
the future.
But a detailed look at the two
separate processes sheds light on
how similar issues may be handled
differently by each system - and the
implicationsthose differences could
have on a case's ultimate outcome
and its impact on campus police
policy moving forward.
GOING THE COMPLAINT
ROUTE
Any citizen who has a problem
with an officer or DPS can go to DPS
and directly file a complaint. With
this option, the incident is not thor-
oughly reviewed by the oversight
committee.
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown
said DPS deals with complaints on
an individual basis.
"We look at what the initial com-
plaint is, and depending on thatspe-
cific complaint and the severity of

Eight students
displaced from their
rooms last night
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily Staff Reporter
Eight students were unable to
return to their rooms last night
after a microwave mishap set a
Baits II Residence Hall room on
fire.
University Police spokes-

woman Diane Brown confirmed
that fire alarms went off in Cross
House in Baits II Residence Hall
just before 3
p.m. yester- First seen on
day for what - w
was later
deemed a
structural fire by the Ann Arbor
Fire Department. No injuries
were reported.
The fire started when a student
tried to reheat food in a container
in his microwave, Brown said.
After a few moments, the food and

container caught fire.
Brown said the studentstopped
the microwave and tried to
remove the container when some
of the burning material dropped
onto a pile of clothes on the floor.
That is when, according to Brown,
"everything ignited."
The student ran out of the room
and was uninjured, Brown said.
Because Cross House is not yet
equipped with a sprinkler system,
firefighters used a hose to put out
the fire, according to Brown.
LSA freshman Ankur Shah said

he was walking from his room
in Baits I when he saw a ladder
leading up to a window at Cross
House. According to Shah, the
window appeared to be broken in,
and smoke was pouring out.
Shah said he and other students
observed that smoke continued to
come out of the room for longer
than he expected.
"We thought the fire was
out," he said, "but apparently it
wasn't."
Brown said that much of the

Student groups bring health
care reform debate to campus

A2 landmark to shut its doors

College Dems,
Republicans look to
mobilize students
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily Staff Reporter
With the debate over health
care reform raging around the
country and in the halls of Con-
gress, campus organizations are
mobilizing to try and bring the
conversation to the Diag.
The most recent health care
reform bill passed in the United
States Senate on Dec. 24 of last

year. A conference committee
will now meet to reconcile the
differences between the United
States House of Representatives
and Senate's version of the bill.
The House's version will cost
more than an estimated $1 tril-
lion, while the Senate's version
will cost about $848 billion over
the next decade.
The House seeks to extend
health care coverage to roughly
40 million uninsured Americans
by reducing the cost of health
care, while the Senate's bill pro-
poses to expand health care cov-
erage to approximately 31million
uninsured Americans through

various subsidies and mandates.
It also requires that Medicaid
services are provided to 15 mil-
lion additional people.
The University's chapter of
College Republicans has been
bringing in experts to provide
students with a conservative per-
spective on health care reform
and explain their opposition to
the legislation. Meanwhile, the
University's chapter of College
Democrats has been working to
garner support from students
and ordinary voters for health
care reform.

After 58 years, John
Leidy Shop will
close in February
By LINDSAYKRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
After 58 years of selling
chotchkies and china on East
Liberty Street, the John Leidy
Shop will close its doors at the
end of February.
Since the shop's opening in

1951 bytAnn Arbor resident John
Leidy, the store has been known
as a high-end family gift shop,
which sells fine china and other
goods. But, as has been the case
with many mom-and-pop shops,
the economy and the changing
gift shop market took a toll on
the store, prompting the family
to decide to close the shop.
"It wasn't something we
decided a year ago and just
announced," said Leidy's son,
Peter Leidy. "It was just the
economy and changing practices

in the way people do theirshop-
ping. It wan a recent, final deci-
sion after a long couple of years
heading in a direction we would
have liked to turn around."
Since the family's announce-
ment in late December, the shop
has received an outpouring of
community support and has been
very busy with customers who
are taking advantage of their last
chance to buy the store's unique
merchandise. The family hopes
this business will continue until

Nikolai Wasielewski, a
19-year-old Michigan State

HARVARD RECEIVED
RECORD APPLICANTS
A record-breaking 30,000
students have applied for
admission to Harvard Uni-
versity, according to an arti-
cle in The Harvard Crimson.
William Fitzsimmons,
dean of admissions and finan-
cial aid, told the Crimson that
the number of received appli-
cations represents a 5-percent
increase from last year.
Fitzsimmons said the
increase is a result of more

financial aid offered, the
elimination of early-admis-
sion and Harvard's newly-
founded engineering school,
according to the article.
According to the article,
admissionsto Harvard's School
of Engineering and Applied
Sciences increased substan-
tially since it was created in
2007. Despite the increase in
applicants, Fitzsimmons said
Harvard will still continue its
conservative acceptance rate,
according to the article. Last
year, the university accepted 7
percent of applicants, accord-
ing to the article.
U. OF CHICAGO TO HIRE
60 NEW PROFESSORS
As many schools through-
out the country are cutting
faculty positions, the Univer-
sity of Chicago plans to hire

60 tenure-tracked faculty
members, according to the
UniversityofChicago Maroon
newspaper. The faculty body
will grow 1 percent each year
for the next five years as part
of the university's expansion,
according to the article.
University of Chicago Pro-
vost Thomas Rosenbaum told
the Maroon that most of the
new employees will be junior
faculty members so that they
may frise in rank over the years.
The expansion is part ofuni-
versity President Robert Zim-
mer's plan to strengthen the
university "across the board."
Rosenbaum said in the
article that the university
wanted new hires in "par-
ticularly exciting areas...with
intellectual need and educa-
tional impact."

smoke clearance and ensuring
there were no flames behind walls
and deep within the structure of
the building.
She said the room where the.
fire started as well as the hallway
where the room was located, were
damaged by fire - with minor

water damages to other rooms
in that hall: No other floors were
affected.
While she does not yet have an
estimate as to the cost of dam-
ages, Brown said some electri-
cal and structural repairs will be
required.
"The fixtures in the hallway are
all melted," Brown said. "But the
student's room had the most dam-
age. There's really no other way to
describe how it looked than to say

his room is destroyed."

NEWS BRIEFS
AUBURN HILLS, Mich.
* New models a big
part of Chrysler
turnaround plan
Chrysler sold more than
118,000 Sebring sedans in 2001.
Eight years later, the automaker
barely sold 27,000 as its bank-
ruptcy filing sent customers
fleeing to the car's newer, better
competitors.
Chrysler now has a turnaround
plan that promises improved
quality and a stream of new
models. But it won't work unless
Chrysler can get cars like the
Sebring back on people's shopping
lists. To do that, Chrysler is going
back to the basics: Reinventing its
car brands - Chrysler as a luxu-
ry line, Dodge as a quirky value
brand - and reintroducing them
with head-turning ads.
It's a tall order, but Chrysler
insists it can be done.
"We've had troubles. Yeah. We
saw death. But the whole world
needs to realize we're serious
about this plan," Dodge brand
chief Ralph Gilles told The Asso-
ciated Press in a recent interview.
"We're no dummies. We know
what a good car is and what a
good car isn't."

Man who attempted
to open airplane
door released
A man accused of attempting to
I open an airplane's exterior door
while in flight has been released
after investigators determined it
wasn't a terrorism matter, author-
ities said yesterday.
The incident occurred Saturday
on a United Airlines jetliner en
route from Washington, D.C., to
Las Vegas. The plane, which had
more than 100 people aboard, was
diverted to Denver International
Airport.
FBI spokeswoman Kathy
Wright said a passenger tried
opening one of the front doors of
the airplane and may have tried
to open the cockpit door before
passengers restrained him. The
man wan taken into cuatody, ques-
tioned and released for a medical
evaluation, she said.
Authorities will decide on
charges after reviewing the inci-
dent, Wright said.
WASHINGTON
Unemployment
rates rose in 43
states last month
Unemployment rates rose in 43
states last month, the government
said Friday, painting a bleak pic-
ture of the job market and illus-
trating nationwide data released
two weeks ago.
The rise in joblessness was a
sharp change from November,
when 36 states said their unem-
ployment rates fell. Four states -
South Carolina, Delaware, Florida
and North Carolina - reported

record-high jobless rates in
December.
New Jersey's rate, meanwhile,
rose to a 33-year high of 10.1 per-
cent while New York's reached a
26-year high of 9 percent.
Analysts said the report showed
the economy is recovering at too
weak a pace to generate consistent
job creation.

Lashing, prison for
* Saudi teen accused
of attacking teacher
A teenage girl has been sen-
tenced to a 90-lash flogging and
two months in prison as punish-
ment for assaulting a teacher, a
Saudi judge said in an interview
published yesterday.
Human rights group Amnesty
International said the assault hap-
pened after the girl was caught
with a camera phone at school.
The teenager's name was not
immediately available. She could
be spared with a pardon from King
Abdullah, said Judge Riyadh al-
Meihdib.
"The verdict was read out to her
at the court and she did not object,"
al-Meihdib told Al-Watan, a nation-
al Saudi daily newspaper.
He said the teacher refused to
forgive the girl, who will not appeal
the case. Camera phones are banned
at the school. Al-Watan quoted the
school headmaster describing the
girl as "about twenty" years old.

Bin Laden claims credit for terrorist plot

Authorities say bin
Laden endorsed
Christmas Day
attack for visibility
CAIRO (AP) - Osama bin
Laden endorsed the failed attempt
to blow up a U.S. airliner on
Christmas Day and threatened
new attacks against the Unit-
ed States in an audio message
released yesterday that appeared
aimed at asserting he maintains
some direct command over al-
Qaida-inspired offshoots.
However, U.S. officials and sev-
eral researchers who track ter-
rorist groups said there was no
indication bin Laden or any of his
top lieutenants had anything to
do with or even knew in advance
of the Christmas plot by a Yemen-
based group that is one of sev-
eral largely independent al-Qaida
franchises.
A U.S. State Department
spokesman said al-Qaida's core
leadership offers such groups
strategic guidance but depends on
them to carry it out.
"He's trying to continue to
appear relevant" by talking up the
attempted attack by an affiliate,

the spokesman,.P.J. Crowley, said.
The one-minute message
was explicit in its threat of new
attacks. Like the airline plot, bin
Laden said they would come in
response to America's support for
Israel.
"God willing, our raids on you
will continue as long as your sup-
port for the Israelis continues,"
bin Laden said in the recording,
which was released to the Al-
Jazeera news.channel.
"The message delivered to you
through the plane of the heroic
warrior Umar Farouk Abdulmu-
tallab was a confirmation of the
previous messages sent by the
heroes of the Sept. 11," he said of
the Nigerian suspect in the Dec.
25 botched attack.
"If our messages had been able
to reach you through words we
wouldn't have been delivering
them through planes."
Directing his statements at
President Barack Obama - "from
Osama to Obama," he said - bin
Laden added: "America will never
dream of security unless we will
have it in reality in Palestine."
The message, which White
House officials said could not
immediately be authenticated,
raised again the question of how
much of a link exists between

al-Qaida's top leadership along
the Afghan-Pakistani border and
the handful of loosely affiliated
groups operating in the Arabian
Peninsula, North Africa and Iraq.
The al-Qaida leader, who was
last heard from in September,
seemed intent on showing he
remains more than an ideological
figurehead, as most analysts have
suggested he has become during
the terror network's evolution into
decentralized offshoots. But some
questioned whether al-Qaida's
core leadership was involved.
"They weren't putting the
final touches on this operation,"
said Evan Kohlmann, a senior
investigator for the New York-
based NEFA Foundation, which
researches Islamic militants.
Still, the Saudi and Yemeni
leaders of al-Qaida in the Ara-
bian Peninsula, which formed
in Yemen a year ago, have a long
history of direct personal contact
with bin Laden. It is plausible
that - if they were able to - they
would have informed bin Laden
of the airliner plot and sought his
approval, Kohlmann said.
The Yemen-based group's lead-
er, Nasir al-Wahishi, was once bin
Laden's personal secretary, and its
top military commander, Qassim
al-Raimi, trained in bin Laden's

main camp in Afghanistan, Kohl-.
mann said.
Two of the group's top mem-
bers were detainees at the Guan-
tanamo Bay U.S. military prison
who were released in November
2007.
The Yemen offshoot is largely
self-sustaining, with its own theo-
logical figures, bomb makers and a
network for funneling in recruits.
"The training and the definition
of the attack was by the local lead-
ers of al-Qaida in the Arabian Pen-
insula," said Rohan Gunaratna,
author of "Inside Al Qaeda: Global
Network of Terror."
"So, in many ways you can say
bin Laden is exploiting for his
benefit this particular attack. Bin
Laden still wants to claim lead-
ership for the global jihad move-
ment."
U.S. investigators say the
Nigerian suspect in the Dec. 25
attempted bombing told them he
had been trained in Yemen and
given the explosives there by al-
Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.
Abdulmutallab is accused of
attempting to blow up the plane
with an explosive powder hidden
in his underwear as the aircraft
approached Detroit Metro Air-
port. The device failed to deto-
nate.

Bin Laden's message came
four weeks after the Yemen-
based group made its own claim
of responsibility for the bomb
plot with a differeut justification
- linking it to Yemeni military
attacks on al-Qaida targets with
the help of U.S. intelligence.
There was no way to verify the
voice on the audio message was
actually bin Laden's, but it resem-
bled previous recordings attribut-
ed to him. U.S.-based IntelCenter,
which monitors militant messag-
es, said the manner of the record-

Aiding diversity
'U' must make financial help accessible to those in need
hile the University may claim to hold a strong commit-
ment to diversity, its actions haven't always support-
ed that claim. A recent study by The Education Trust
group found that the University of Michigan was one of several
universities where levels of accessibility and success of minority
and low-income students is on the decline. Though many of these
public universities, including the University, assert that they value
diversity, the study shows that they aren't backing up their words
with action. A diverse student body is important to a comprehensive
learning environment and the University must act upon its declared
commitment to diversity by increasing minority outreach programs
and directing financial aid to those who need it most.

Preparing a flatter world

The report, which was released last
week, rated the accessibility of financial
aid to minority and low-income students
at public universities from 2004 to 2008.
The Education Trust group revealed that
in recent years, many public universities,
including the University, were awarding
more financial aid to well-off students and
less support was being given to students of
low-income backgrounds. As reported by
the Daily last week, the study identified
the University as one of the worst public
institutions in the nation for its decreased
accessibility to financial aid.
Part of the worth of attending a large uni-
versity is that students gain knowledge of a
diverse population. But with racial diversity
at the University continuing to decline, stu-
dents are losing a valuable opportunity to
learn. And it's a slippery slope - as diversity
decreases, the University is less appealing
to a diverse group of students.
Officials at the University have claimed
that they are doing everything in their
power to foster diversity, according to a
Daily interview with University Senior Vice
Provost of Academic Affairs Lester Monts.
But since the ban of affirmative action at
public universities in Michigan in 2006, the
University has clearly faced new challeng-
es. But its responses haven't translated into

success. There have been outreach initia-
tives by University officials within the past
year like the Wolverine Outreach Workshop
held in Detroit in late 2009, but these pro-
grams haven't produced the desired results
- minority figures at the University have
dropped every year since 2006. The Univer-
sity needs to scale up existing programs and
investigate new ways to attract a diverse
student body.
But the real shock of the Education Trust
group's study was that the University has
been, in recent years, giving more money
to wealthier students. It's alarming to learn
that the University hasn't been directing
as much aid as possible to the low-income
students who actually depend upon it to pay
for tuition. There is no acceptable explana-
tion for spending less on students with more
need and giving more to students who don't
actually require aid. The Office of Financial
Aid has a responsibility to ensure that the
students who need aid the most have access
to it. The office should redouble its efforts to
offer more aid to low-income students.
The University must remember that
proof is in results, not rhetoric. It needs to
increase outreach and aid to minority and
low-income students to make sure that the
next time a financial aid study is published,
it isn't at the bottom of the rankings.

love Ann Arbor, but my favorite
part of college took place about
2,200 miles away from the Diag,
the Big House and
Rick's. I had want- .
ed to study abroad
since high school,
and in May 2008, i
went to Costa Rica
as part of the Ross
School of Business's a'
three-week study
abroad program.
Even though the COURTNEY
trip was everything RATKOWIAK
I could have hoped
for, Costa Rica was
never one of the
places where I had been itching to live
and learn about international business.
But I went to Alajuela because as a Ross
student, my options for study abroad
were limited to just three locations.
Rankings show that Ross is one of
the best business schools in the nation.
(The 2010 U.S. News rankings have
us ranked fourth, which is a disap-
pointment after being ranked third
for years.) But in terms of pushing stu-
dents to learnmore about global econo-
mies and international business issues,
it's clear Ross isn't even atthe top of the
BigTen - and that's ridiculous.
There are a lot of reasons why busi-
ness school students can't just leave
Ann Arbor for a semester like many of
our LSA counterparts, BBA Program
Director Scott Moore explained to me.
The biggest is the school's sequential
structuring, where every core class
(for example, Marketing 300) has to be
taken during a certain semester (first
semester, junior year). Even though I
understand the need for prerequisites,
the strict scheduling for every single
class - like being required to take mar-
keting a year after accounting, even
though the classes aren't related what-
soever - unnecessarily limits students'
study abroad opportunities.
Moore also raised the point that
with on-campus internship recruit-
ing during junior year and full-time
recruiting during senior year, it would
disadvantage Business School students
to travel during those years unless they
had jobs lined up before leaving.
It's also almost impossible to get

Business School credit for non-Ross
study abroad programs, and the only
sponsored programs for credit are
the three-week trips to Costa Rica,
Germany/Slovakia and China. That
means that if students want to go
abroad during the school year and
join an LSA program, they will prob-
ably end up staying at the University
an extra semester or two to make up
for lost credits.
The way I see it, though, most of
those issues are just logistics, things
that the Business School administra-
tion could work around or change -
if it wanted to. But with an intense
focus on job placement and mov-
ing up that rankings ladder, the real
problem is that promoting study
abroad opportunities just isn't high
on the priority list.
In my internship last summer,
working for a multinational company,
it didn't take long for me to wish I had
the same international opportunities
as fellow interns from other busi-
ness schools. Two of the girls I met
on the first day, one from Purdue and
one from Indiana, had returned from
semester-long trips to Spain less than
a week before.
My friend from Indiana's Kelley
School of Business worked 11 hours per
week at an internship and also earned
12 business school credits taking
classes like International Operations
and International Marketing. Now,
with a full-time job offer in hand, she
says our summer internship "felt like a
breeze" after working in Spain because
she had already learned how to handle
herself in an unfamiliar business set-
ting, where she had often felt lost and
confused because of the culture differ-
ences.
Michigan should take a few lessons
from Indiana's business program. Kel-
ley has an "International Dimension"
requirement, for which students need
to take a minimum of six credits in
international business classes or study
abroad classes. Ross doesn't have any--
thing close to that. (The foreign lan-
guage distribution requirementdoesn't
count - I learned nothing about Span-
ish business while sitting in the MLB
as a freshman.)
To be fair, Ross is trying to catch up.

Moore estimated 80 to 100 students
this year have signed up for the three-
week summer study abroad programs.
And while talking with Leslie Davis
and Vicki Simon from the Ross School
of Business's Center for International
Business Education, I learned about
interesting options I didn't know exist-
ed, like CIBE-funded international
summer internships and the fact that
business students with international
studies minors receive up to $750 in
funding toward the three-week study
abroad programs.
Ross should offer
more international
opportunities.
But for Ross students who truly
want to immerse themselves in
another country's business culture,
three weeks just doesn't cut it. The
fact that I didn't know about the
other CIBE options - even though
I've studied abroad once already and
have been in the school for three
years - means that a lot of other
students probably don't either. And
that's where Ross falls far below the
elite standards it has set for itself.
It's obvious that the world is becom-
ing flatter every day, as Thomas L.
Friedman detailed in his book of a
similar name. Every business school
student knows that - we had to read
the book for our Business Informa-
tion Technology core class, after all.
But compared to other schools, Ross
doesn't encourage us to get out there
and experience that flat world. If Ross
took the time and energy to make
international studies a graduation
requirement, maybe we'd be graduat-
ing from one of the premier business
schools with a little more knowledge of
what goes on outside of just Ann Arbor
and Wall Street.

Change beyond party lines

Had I been writing a Facebook status at the
time of Scott Brown's victory in Massachu-
setts, I surely would have typed an incoherent
"ajdasghgyg!!" to express my extreme displea-
sure and unhappiness at the election outcome.
In the land of the late Democrat Ted Kennedy,
in the state with the most progressive health
care in the country, I struggled to grasp how
a Republican was elected. The whole thing
seemed like one bad dream. While the Republi-
cans were shouting how "the nation's voice had
finally been heard" and Democrats were scram-
bling to try and figure out a plan for health
care, I began thinking about how our brief
and relatively unproductive era of progressive
dominance was over and why it seemed that we
could never fully get the upperhand.
The Nobel Prize-winning economist and
The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman
expressed this idea when he stated in his blog,
"He Wasn't The One We've Been Waiting For," in
reference to President Barack Obama. After the
2006 midterm elections, when Democrats finally
took back Congress, and the historic 2008 elec-
tion, it seemed as though our time had finally
come. Progressives finally had their chance -
with all the power in hands of the Democratic
Party - to implement the legislation we had been
pushing for. Progressive deliverance and salva-
tion had come with Obama, but we have yet to
see any tangible results. Why is that? Despite
the statements of naive cynics, it isn't the fault of
Obama or the supposed "ineffective" Congress
led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). It
is merely the political environment of today and
the realities of beinga progressive on the left.
Whether majority or minority, being a pro-
gressive is the most difficult political position
to have. It represents change, reform and the
constant perfection of policies. Being a pro-
gressive means working for the ideal and being
idealistic. Compare this to conservatives on
the right, who merely have to defend the status

quo and the reality of the system today. Isn't
it much easier to fight for what already exists
than for what could be? The public understands
the inadequacies of current structures, such as
the health care system, but is fearful of reform.
After all, the devil you know is better than the
devil you don't, right?
Progressives fight for the interests of the
underprivileged and underrepresented, the least
socially and politically mobilized. It is always
said that interest groups have a wealthy upper-
class bias, so how much easier is it for conserva-
tivesto rep'esentthe needsofcorporatebusiness,
with enough capital to invest in their own politi-
cal interests? This becomes especially true now,
as the Supreme Court has most recently decided
to rid corporations of any limits on campaign
funding. Your vote may soon become void to the
benefits of large companies who buy legislation.
On the contrary, when progressives work to fight
poverty, they are generally advocating for groups
with little electoral benefits. Conservatives have
the luxury of enjoying a platform that feeds the
interests of greedy and economically unhealthy
self-interest. How much easier is it for the public
to hear "tax cut" than "the hard and difficult road
ahead to economic stability?"
Such is that of the progressive puzzle and
why it may never be solved. It is simple enough
to understand that the political policies of
conservatives on the right are easier to sell
despite the many times they are not in the best
economic or social interests of the country.
Progressives may never have the upperhand
politically. The only consolation that can ever
be had from being a progressive is that eventu-
ally reform will come. It is only inevitable. With
all the frustrations that come with pushing and
working to change the system, progressives can
always keep in their minds that it is not in vain.
However slow or however prolonged, progres-
sive goals will be achieved.

f you believe everything you hear,
then Republican Scott Brown's
victory last week in a special elec-
tion to choose Ted
Kennedy's succes-
sor as senator from
Massachusetts was
an Earth-shatter- k
ing event. But even
those of us who are
too smart to buy
that nonsense must-
admit that Brown's
victory does kick IMRAN
off a very impor- SYED
tant election year,
especially here in
Michigan.
With Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm ineligible for re-election
due to term limits, a crowded field
of potential candidates has emerged.
While the list will certainly be pared
down well before the August prima-
ry, the muddle that currently exists is
very telling of where this state stands
politically.
Granholm - a perpetually unpopu-
lar governor who miraculously won
two terms - inherited a state on the
verge of ruin. She stood tall atthehelm
through what was certainly Michi-
gan's toughest decade in a long time.
She will leave the state in its most fam-
ished condition yet,but her failure was
really a failure of circumstance,
That unemployment is unforgiv-
ingly rampant in the state, and that its
most powerful corporations have been
brought to their knees is no secret.
As a result of the poor economic out-
look, Michigan will likely lose elec-
toral votes after this year's census. As
troubling as those situations are, an
equally important consideration here
is Michigan's political identity.
Like most of America, Michigan
has a reputation for being a little
right of center. The influence of labor
unions and a large urban center like
Detroit often push the state into the
blue, but the general perception has

always been that this state is closely
divided. Today, Michigan has eight
Democrats and seven Republicans in
the U.S. House of Representatives.
Even accounting for some skillful ger-
rymandering, it doesn't get more even
than that.
Considering the events of 2009, it
seemed that while Michiganders may
retain their centrist values, the state
would not go red in a major election
any time soon. As the Detroit auto-
makers struggled to survive and the
Obama administration considered a
bailout, national Republicans engaged
in an alarming line of rhetoric that
surely dissipated support their party
may have otherwise had among blue-
collar Michiganders.
Following the strategy of squealing
against anything Obama did (not to
mention the jobs brought to their own
states by foreign automakers), southern
Republicans railed against the bailouts
for American automakers. As Michi-
gan bled jobs, resources and a sense of
well-being, many national Republicans
turned their backs, even goingso far as
to speak of the Big Three's troubles as
necessary and long overdue.
Michigan's workers surely would
never forgive those who hung them
out to dry at their darkest hour. And
for that reason, it's hard to imagine
even today that Michigan will go red
in a presidential election any time
soon. But that does not mean that
Republicans are a non-factor in state
level races in Michigan.
Contrary to what the national
media has said about Republican vic-
tories in Massachusetts, Virginia and
New Jersey, those events will not
cause a snowball effect in places like
Michigan. If Republicans win the gov-
ernorship in 2010, it will be because
they were smart enough to distance
themselves from the national party
and remain relevant to Michigan's
suffering middle class. Regardless of
national Republican victories, the real
factor in Michigan will be who voters

trust to turn things around.
On the Democratic side, no one
associated with Granholm stands a
chance. For that reason, Lt. Gov. John
Cherry's decision to leave the race
came as no surprise. That's also why
there has been so much buzz around
the race's potential wildcard, Univer-
sity Regent Denise Ilitch.
Red/blue won't
matter in the
governor 's race.

0

0

Ilitch is exactly the type of hybrid
candidate the Democrats need to
retain the governor's mansion. Repub-
licans have hammered Granholm on
jobs and her relationship with busi-
nesses. Of course, no such allegations
can be hurled at Ilitch, an accom-
plished businesswoman who can
couple her familial fortune with her
moderate progressivismto bethe ideal
candidate in 2010.
But Ilitch may not run at all, in
which case other contenders like
state House Speaker Andy Dillon
and Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero
will have to step into a similar hybrid
position to counter what the Republi-
cans offer. Republicans for their part
can do no wrong, so long as they avoid
making this a national race.
Regardless of the ultimate out-
come, the muddled and disparate
nature of the current pool of candi-
dates is indicative of where this state
stands at the end of a brutal decade.
Michiganders aren't so worried about
what party their potential savior may
come from: We just know we need to
get it right.

DPS OVERSIGHT
From Page lA
that complaint, we'll decide wheth-
er or not to step up to an internal
investigation," Brown said.
She said most complaints are
from people who are not satisfied
with the way an officer treated
them and from people who are not
happy about being thrown out of a
football game for being drunk.
Regardless of the incident, DPS
reviews each complaint by talking
to the officer in question, available
witnesses, the person who filed the
complaint and viewing any evi-
dence like video footage.
Brown said an investigation is
never led by the supervisor of the
officer in question "so that there's
some sort of independent eye."
" After an investigation is com-
pleted, a complaint is deemed
either unfounded or founded.
Brown said DPS investigations
determine most of the complaints
to be "unfounded," meaning a citi-
zen voiced concern about an offi-
cer, but the investigation concluded
that the officer acted appropriately
in the particular situation.
A complaint also will be labeled
unfounded if there is a lack of evi-
dence.
Out of 17 complaints received by
in 2007 and 2008, 13 were classi-
fied as unfounded.
A complaint is only labeled
founded when it is determined
an action a person is complaining
about did take place and that the
officer did not follow protocol or
engage in proper conduct.
Depending on the incident, DPS
Executive Director Ken Magee will
determine any final discipline orcor-
rective action. Brown said an officer
will typically attend counseling, but
that it's possible for an officer to be
suspended or terminated. .
According to the February
2009 Commission on Accredita-
tion for Law Enforcement Agen-
cies (CALEA) report - a document
obtained by the Daily through
a Freedom of Information Act
request - one DPS officer was sus-
pended and one was terminated in
2008 while five officers were sus-
pended in 2007.
Once the investigation of a com-
plaint is completed, the person who
brought the complaint receives a
written response about the out-
come from the investigating lieu-
tenant officer. If the complainant
has further concerns, he or she can
appeal to Magee, who is informed
of any complaint filed with the
department and is updated on its
investigation.
While the DPS Oversight Com-
mittee's main role is to act as a
check on the campus police, it does
not have any direct involvement
in dealing with complaints filed
with DPS. Instead, the committee
HEALTH CARE
From Page 1A
October, College Democrats has
teamed with Organizing For
America - the grassroots con-
tinuation of President Barack
Obama's campaign - to hold
phone banks where they have
called more than 6,000 Demo-
cratic supporters, encouraging
them to contact local legislators
to lobby in support of health care
reform.

College Democrats also holds
Diag Days to urge students to
make phone calls to local leg-
islators to support health care
reform.
By encouraging University
students to contact legislators,
Samuel Marvin, chair of the
University's chapter of College
Democrats, said he hopes to get
young voices heard in the health
care debate.
"We know that a lot of people
voted in 2008. They voted for
Obama, they voted for Demo-
cratic senators and they voted for
Democraticcongressmenbecause
health care is an issue, and it's
something people want," Mar-
vin said. "We want to be as big a
part of that as possible, so we can
reallyget the student perspective
as something that's talked about
and something that's respected
in the debate."
The College Democrats have
also worked closely with United
States Congressman John Dingell
(D-Mich.), the sponsor of the bill
in the House of Representatives,
who has been a strong advocate
of health care reform during his
54-year career in Congress.
In an e-mail interview with
The Michigan Daily yesterday,
Dingell wrote that the best way
for students to get involved in
health care reform is simply to
start speaking up.
"The message is really the
same for everyone - make your-
self heard," Dingell wrote. "It
could be as simple as sharing
your thoughts around the dinner
table when you go home, but the
important thing is to keep talk-

receives a list of complaints at one
meeting each year.
Brown said if a complaint of
"substantive nature" is presented,
DPS makes sure the committee
hears about it before the annual
report. But besides these infre-
quent instances, Brown said the
department doesn't contact the
committee.
"We don't pick up the phone and
tell the oversight committee when
somebody has made a complaint
that they were thrown out of a foot-
ball game, and then we've discov-
ered in the investigation that yeah,
they were thrown out because they
were drunk and disorderly," Brown
said. "We don't take up the com-
mittee's time to go back that day to
say 'oh, this was one of those com-
plaints."'
Brown said given the work DPS
does, it's impressive that they
receive so few complaints each
year.
"We have very few complaints
yet we're dealing with difficult
people all the time and difficult
situations all the time," she said.
She cited the CALEA assessment
report DPS officially received in
August, which made DPS the 13th
out of about 600 police agencies
in the state to be accredited. DPS
was also the first law enforcement
agency from the Big Ten confer-
ence to receive accreditation by the
commission.
Brown said DPS excelled in han-
dling citizen complaints and inter-
nal affairs investigations - one of
the categories the report evalu-
ated.
The report listed that DPS
received 12 citizen complaints in
2008,11 in 2007 and 13 in 2006 and
concluded that DPS appropriately
managed the complaints.
"The agency is keenly aware that
complaints against the agency or
employees are to be taken serious-
ly," the report stated. "The agency
provides the opportunity to file the
complaint online, in person, or in
writing. Persons who wish to file a
complaint can do so anonymously."
Brown said DPS was happy with
the overall results from the assess-
ment.

I think that, 'yes, indeed, we're one
of the best there is in the country,"'
Brown said.
Though DPS receives less than
15 complaints each year, police
agencies at other colleges in the
state of Michigan, receive far fewer
complaints than DPS.
Fred Harris, associate director
of the Central Michigan Univer-
sity Police Department, said the
department has received either
zero or one complaints each year.
Greg O'Dell, police chief of Eastern
Michigan UniversityPolice Depart-
ment, said the department receives
between zero and five complaints

taurants.
"The June event exceeded our
expectations, and the January
(event) was bigger and better
than June," Thomson said.
Restaurant Week is organized
by the Main Street Area Asso-
ciation, a non-profit organiza-
tion that works to attract people
to downtown Ann Arbor. Res-
taurant Week, which the MSAA
plans to make a biannual event,
is purposely scheduled during
traditionally slow times for Ann
Arbor businesses, Thomson said.
"January, for downtown, is a
slow time," Thomson said. "(The
goal of Restaurant Week is) just
to bring people downtown, give
downtown a little boost and give
people the chance to eat a little
something special and afford-
able."
Despite the usually lighttraffic
this time of year, downtown res-
taurants were packed last week,
according to Thomson.
"I don't know if you've ever had
lunch in downtown Ann Arbor
here in the week, but it's typically
not very busy," Thomson said. "I
just love seeing crowds - crowds
in restaurants at lunch. It's won-
derful!"
Thomson said the event was
originally inspired by a trip by
local business owners James
and Kathy Macdonald to Cali-
fornia, where they attended San
Francisco's Restaurant Week. At
the time, they owned Bella Ciao,
a restaurant on West Liberty
Street, and thought that copying
the event could draw attention to

Ann Arbor's diverse cuisine.
Brandon Johns, owner of Ann
Arbor restaurant Grange Kitchen
& Bar, which opened last August,
said he did not hesitate to partici-
pate in Restaurant Week.
"It's a good way to bring busi-
ness in January, simple as that,"
Johns said. "We haven't been
able to take a reservation for four
days."
On its regular menu, Grange
Kitchen & Bar's main courses
start at $21, but for restaurant
week they offered select menu
items at a discount based on vari-
ety and cost.
"We want to be cost-effec-
tive as well, because it is such a
deeply discounted dinner for us,"
Johns said.
Grange's Restaurant Week
dinner offered a choice of soup or
salad, a main dish of pan roasted
chicken, grilled lake trout or
cider braised beef, and a choice
of dessert - all for $25.
Binod Dhakal, manager at
Shalimar Restaurant, said that
in addition to bringing in new
customers, Restaurant Week
can also be a good time to test
potential new items on its menu,
which offers traditional Indian
dishes.
"We are introducing new items
so we can get feedback to refer-
ence so we can put those items on
our menu," Dhakal said.
Hope Mleczko, manager of
vegetarian restaurant Seva on
East Liberty Street, said Restau-
rant Week can be a great chance
to reach new patrons.
"We did see a lot of regulars
as well, but in addition to them
there are alot of other people - a
lot of new faces," Mleckzko said.


LEIDY
From Page 1A
all of its products are sold before
the lease on the shop's space ends
on Feb. 28.
"A lot of our regular customers
know that the store is closing,"
Peter Leidy said. "Our hope is
that it continues to be busy and
that most, if not all, of the mer-
chandise that we still have will
be gone hopefully sooner than
the end of February."
Because of the store's fam-
ily atmosphere, the shop and its
owners have developed relation-
ships with customers and the
Ann Arbor community through-
out its existence.
"Our family has relationships
with hundreds - if not thousands
- of people," Peter Leidy said.
"It's a sad time of saying good-
bye to the John Leidy Shop, but
it's also years and years of great
friendships and memories."
The store has suffered from the
changing gift market in which
customers shop for gifts at large
chain stores online instead of at
smaller, local shops. Peter Leidy
said the family has tried to strike
a balance between maintaining
the store's identity while keep-
ing up with customers' changing
tastes.
"There are certain lines of
crystal and china that the store
has been carrying since almost
day one," he said. "There is other
stuff that goes with how people's
tastes have changed over the
years. The tricky thing is you
can only change so much before
the whole identity of the store
changes."
For both loyal customers and

the occasional shopper, the shop
has been known to have a variety
of gifts that can suit almost any
person's needs. In 1959, the shop
not only occupied one storefront
next to the Michigan Theater but
also another on the other side.
One shop sold China, while the
other sold dinnerware.
The second storefront closed
in 2006, and the Leidy fam-
ily consolidated the shop's goods
into one space.
The store has always been a
family business, and upon John
Leidy's death in 1993, his wife
and children continued to run
the store.
Four of the five Leidy children
have other careers, but Peter
Leidy said his sister Liz will be
the most impacted by the store's
closure because she is most
actively involved in the day-to-
day business operations.
"She's not really thinking a
whole lot about that because
there is a whole lot of energy
with the store right now," Peter
Leidy said.
All the merchandise in the
store is on sale. For now, the fam-
ily is focusing on selling as much
of it as possible before the lease
runs out.
As of now, there are no defi-
nite plans for the space the shop
currently occupies. However,
the landlord has been talking to
potential new tenants, according
to Peter Leidy.
While the Leidy family is sad
to say good-bye to the shop, Peter
Leidy said the family takes com-
fort in having 58 years of memo-
ries they can reflect on.
"It's a bittersweet thing and
not all doom and gloom but years
of joyful memories," he said.


ing."
Marvin said he hopes to get
students involved because they
are one of the groups that would
be most affected by the passage
of health care reform. The bill
would allow students to have
continued coverage under their
parents' health insurance plan
until age 27.
"That's a big hurdle for a lot
of people when they graduate
because if they don't have a job
with good benefits, they're out of
health insurance," Marvin said.
Despite the optimism among
College Democrats and other
Democrats across the nation
regarding health care reform,
the Republicans gained a cru-
cial victory with the election of
Republican Scott Brown as Mas-
sachusetts senator last Tuesday
- a win many officials speculate
could put the passing of a health
care reform bill in jeopardy, at
least in the near future.
Charles Bogren, co-chair of
the University's chapter of Col-
lege Republicans, said the vic-
tory proves the nation is unhappy
with current health care reform

efforts and is ready for a change,
which is why his group is work-
ing to mobilize student opposi-
tion to reform.
Bogren added that he has seen
an increase in College Republican
membership this year, which he
attributes to students' opposition
to Obama's work as president.
"We've seen a lot more mem-
bers this year that have joined
because of what the Obama
administration has been doing so
far, and it's great to see this cam-
paign and this special election
show that a lot of people do agree
with us," Bogren said.
Last Thursday, College Repub-
lieans invited physician and
University alum Robert Steele
to speak about his concerns of
how the health care reform bill
would negatively affect the state
of Michigan.
Steele has been involved in
various health care debates over
the years and has been a member
of The Heritage Foundation - a
conservative think tank that does

research and analysis of public
policy issues - for more than 20
years.
With his background in the
medical industry and concern
for the current state of health
care reform in the United States,
Steele is considering running
against Dingell in the 2010 elec-
tion.
At the College Republicans
meeting, he said his idea to run
for Congress stems from his con-
cern for future generations, cit-
ing his four children and nieces
and nephews, who are facing a
country with an uncertain and
debt-ridden future.
"As I look out at the crazy
spending that's going on right
now, really the opportunities for
(younger generations) are basi-
cally disappearing with every
year of the exponential growth
of the budget and the deficit and
how the math is turning against
the next generation," Steele said.
"So that's why I wanted to get
involved."

Actors hog the
spotlight

Monday, January 25, 2010 - 7A
xhuming MTs dignity

t is an honor to be here in a
room full of what I consider
to be the most important
people on the planet: actors," said
Ricky Gervais as
he opened last
week's Golden
Globes. "They're
just better than
ordinary people,
aren't they? No,
but we all know
that." ANDREW
We'd like to LAPIN
hope everyone
in that star-studded room was able
to chuckle good-naturedly at Ger-
vais's ribbings, and that no one was
self-absorbed enough - or drunk
enough - to mistake his sarcasm
for groveling sincerity. Unfortu-
nately, we know enough about
Hollywood to know this probably
wasn't the case. Come awards
season, many actors really do
think they're better than ordinary
people, and they have all the shiny
golden trinkets to prove it.
This mindset has heen in place
since the dawn of films, simply hy
virtue of the fact that the actors
are the most visible aspects of the
movie; they're the ones on screen,
they're the ones engaging the
audience. So we see it fit to reward
them and praise them to the skies.
That's all fine and dandy.
The part that gets me is how dis-
proportionately actors are praised
when compared with the screen-
writers who tell them what to say,
the directors who tell them how to
say it, the costumers who tell them
how to dress, the cinematographers
who make sure they're being shown
in their best light, the makeup art-
ists who make sure no one ever has
to see what they really look like,
the people in post-production who
re-dub their singingvoices, the
special-effects guys who make sure
their skin is the right shade of blue,
etc. The list goes on and on, but
according to the studios campaign-
ing for the gold or the general pub-
lie that casually follows the Oscar
race, the movies begin and end with
the actors.
Look, acting's tough. I'm not dis-
putingthat. Very few people in the
world can do what Johnny Depp
and Meryl Streep do. But films are
a collaborative medium. You can't
make a good movie with just good
actors - though with star-studded
dreck like "Nine" and "Every-
body's Fine," Lord knows they've
tried. And so many other people
have input into what the actors
produce on screen, even though we
eventually interpret something like
Sandra Bullock's turn in "The
Blind Side" as entirely the prod-
uct of Sandra Bullock.
Not only that, but as much as
it kills me to say, actors are inter-
changeable. The presence of a
specific actor, in most cases, does
not make or break the impact of
a film. As much as I loved "Up in
the Air" - and I did love it - I
don't see my love as being entirely
dependent on George Clooney's
presence in the film. He could've
been replaced with any other
snarky-sweet actor type, like
Robert Downey, Jr. or Aaron
Eckhart, and I'm sure my enthu-
siasm for the movie wouldn't
have diminished in the slightest.
On those rare occasions when
an iconic, one-of-a-kind perfor-

mance is given by a specific actor,
like Depp in the "Pirates" movies,
we only view the performance in
that light because we have no way
of knowing how any other actor
might have fared in the role. All we
have is the finished product.
Our culture's ever-growing
obsession with actors is justbeg-
ging to be put into perspective,
which is part of the reason why I'm
baffled more attention hasn'tbeen
paid to the brilliant "The Imagi-
narium of Doctor Parnassus." The
mind-bending quadruple perfor-
mance by Heath Ledger, Jude Law,
Colin Farrell and the Deppmeister
elevates the film from a whimsical
fantasy into a wry commentary
on the transformative nature of
performance. Tony, the character
all four of them play, takes on new
Movies are a
team effort.
forms whenever he passes through
the door of someone else's imagi-
nation; he's playingnew roles for
these different "directors." And
in the process, he/they achieve a
certain kind of immortality justby
virtue of being onscreen, a theme
that especially resonates from Led-
ger's unfinished performance.
"Nothing's permanent, not even
death," says the Depp incarnation
of Tony, and we believe him. Actors
live forever, thanks to the movies.
Hell, nominate all four of these
guys for one Best Actor award.
They certainly created a more
memorable and complex character
between the four of them than
most other performances last year.
When the Oscar nominations
are finally announced next Tues-
day, expect, as usual, the major-
ity of attention to be paid to the
acting awards. But if you can tear
yourself away from Mo'Nique's
name for a few minutes (it's hard,
I know, because she has such a
great name), take a look at some
of the other categories, too. Then,
like me, you can find new things
to get indignant about. I'm already
rallying the troops for attack in
the event that "Fantastic Mr. Fox"
and "Coraline" don't receive Best
Animated Feature noms. Join my
cause, and forget about all those
pretty people on screen.
Lapin is an actor - he'll act like he
cares if you e-mail him. To test this,
e-mail him at alapin@umich.edu.

'The Buried Life'
adds a dash of hope
to a bleak lineup
By ROBERT SOAVE
Daily Arts Writer
What do you want to do before
you die? This is the question at the
core of MTV's
latest real-
ity show, "The
Buried Life," *f~~~
which follows
the adventures
of four guys as Mondays at
they check off 10 p.m.
items on a list of MTV
things to achieve
before they die.
The twist is that every time they
accomplish something on their
list, they have to help a random
person do something, too.
"The Buried Life" received

decent media coverage for heing
part of MTV's new brand of pro-
gramming intended to go beyond
the network's traditional terri-
tory of skanky dating shows. The
New York Times ran an article last .

as "MTV for the era of Obama."
Praising the existence of "The
Buried Life," the article celebrated"
that social consciousness was now
going to be a higher priority than
the sexual escapades of attractive
young people.
Not so fast, New York Times.

way, ridiculously good looking and COURt or TV

Commercialism is stealing my bands

By KRISTYN ACHO
Daily Arts Writer
As much as I hate to admit it, I am that
girl. The one whose Google Reader is flood-
ed with news on the latest lo-fi Brooklyn
grunge, gritty London punk or disco-vibe
L.A. bands via the burgeoning indie blogo-
sphere. When I find a band that's nowhere
close to the peak of stardom, I feel like I - in
the twisted workings of my ridiculous mind
- discovered them. At least I know I'll never
be in need of hard drugs; I get a high from
constantly being on the lookout for the latest
up-and-coming bands.
But then something happens. i'll be in a
store or have the television on and I'll hear a
song - my song, by my band - being played.
Cut to last summer for instance: I'm mind-
ing my own business, when I hear a familiar
beat playing in the background of a car com-
mercial. Is that Phoenix, the band known for
making innovative French synth-pop? No,
they wouldn't. But it was. And yes, they did.
What's happening here? These are my
bands. And I'm not trying to come off like a
pretentious bitch here, but I don't want my
favorite bands to go big. Once they're dis-
covered by the masses they'll no doubt get
overplayed - and then the allure dies. I love
having my own bands that barely anyone else
knows about, because, in a way, it makes me
feel connected to them. Is that so wrong? And
I know it's not fair for me to say that they're
"selling out" by wanting to be successful; they
have to make a living somehow. It's illogical,
but I just can't help it. I guess you can say I
have a habit of growing painfully attached.
But how did it get like this? How did the

high-pitched squeals of Passion Pit's "Sleepy-
head" - a track you would think the masses
would find painfully annoying - attract
advertising executives at Palm Pixie? Did The
Magnetic Fields seriously lend its track to a
Caesar Canine Cuisine dog commercial? Talk
about suffering for your art.
Some picks are more predictable, though.
Take Santigold's new-wave, electro-pop slice
"Creator." The track's throbbing bass and
reggae-hipster vocals made Bud Light's lime-
flavored beer seem infinitely cooler. Hell, if
Bud Light is good enough for one of 2008's
hottest new indie artists, it's good enough for
you, too.
You have betrayed me,
Of Montreal. Enjoy
your bloomin' onion.
Companies are clamoring to insert sounds
into their ads to give their products a hip
appeal. Executives would rather use artists
like Wilco in Volkswagen commercials to give
their cars a sleek, cool vibe than do the grunt
work themselves. Financially, bands reap
the benefits of lazy execs, but their integrity
somehow seems lost.
But it might not be fair to throw that in the
faces of artists anymore - the music industry
isn't what it used to be, and bands need to do
whatever possible in order to survive, even if
that means selling their artistic souls to big
business. Still, if we want our favorite bands

to keep making music and commercial adver-
tising provides a means to an end, we all ben-
efit, don't we?
This isn't a new dilemma. Of course, Apple
has used the catchy-bands-plucked-from-
obscurity stunt most prominently in recent
years. The company paired each slick new
version of its iPod with an artist that the
masses had not yet heard of. If any artist was
catapulted into fame by Apple, it's alternative
Canadian artist Feist. You couldn't go any-
where in 2007 without hearing the painfully
overplayed "1234." Unknown no more, Feist
became a Billboard-topping artist thanks to
the psychedelically fresh iPod commercials.
After tracks by indie artists become lost
in a sea of brand-name attachment, they lose
the indie cred that once made them unique
and actually independent. It's hard to proj-
ect a free-spirited, edgy persona when your
once innovative, trippy synths are being tied
to random products (I'm looking at you, Sil-
versun Pickups, in that recent Pontiac Com-
mercial).
That's not to say that I'm willing to give up
on my indie bands that take the mainstream
route; I just know deep down I will never feel
the same about them. Sure, I will continue
shuffling them through my playlists, but at
some point their mainstream appeal will lose
me, and I'll move on to the next up-and-com-
ing thing and hope that they won't go down
the same road. ,
I'm still bitter about Phoenix, and that's
okay. Even though Iam starting to understand
where these bands are coming from, I know
that every time I hear Outback Steakhouse's
debasement of Of Montreal - "Let's go Out-
back tonight" - I am still going to cringe.

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
This is an interesting day. It's a time
when friends could become lovers. All
kinds of intense, flirtatious energy is in
the air. (And it's aggressive, too!)
TAURUS
(April 20to May 20)
Today, some of you will fall in love
with your boss or an authority figure in
your life. Perhaps just a flirtation will
stun you. Others will feel strongly about
creative issues.
GEMINI
(May 21to June 20)
You want to travel today. You want to
go someplace different. You want adven-
ture! Religious, political and artistic
ideas excite you!
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
This is a passionate day for your sign!
(You will feel passionate with partners
about intimate issues.) However, you
also feel passionate about shared prop-
erty and financial matters. Oops.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
An interesting emotional tug of war
exists today between you and partners or
close friends. Even if you have differ-
ences, you'll enjoy the differences!
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
You feel strongly today about health
issues, issues at work or both! Perhaps
you're defending your point of view?
Whatever it is, you're not going to back
down.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
This actually can he a fun-loving,
exciting day for you. Flirtations are pas-
sionate. Sporting events will he compel-
ltive. You want to have fun - or else!

SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
You're determined to accomplish
something at home, perhaps related to
renovations or redecorating projects.
You intend to have your way. And that's
it.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
Today, you're persuasive and forceful
in all your communications. Because of
this quality, it makes now the perfect
time to ask for what you want. (Ya
think?)
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Financial matters are testy today. You
might have squabbles about shared prop-
erty or how you earn money. Disputes
over possessions are possible.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Relations with others definitely are
stimulated today! You can be passionate
and sexy, or full of excitable arguments.
Either way, your exchanges with loved
ones are not boring!
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
You're determined to accomplish as
much as possible at work today. In truth,
you might be better off working alone or
behind the scenes. Give others a wide
berth. (Forewarned is forearmed.)
YOU BORN TODAY You are very
bold about going after what you want. In
fact, sometimes you end up in contro-
versy. You think very carefully about
how to go about getting what you want.
When the moment comes, you act
quickly. Because you're full of decisive
energy, children admire you; ironically,
you often rebel against authority. In the
year ahead, an important decision or
choice awaits you.

An unholy nightmare

Pepa with a
grain of salt

Senselessly villainizing God
in a boring diner, 'Legion'
has no means of redemption
By NICK COSTON
Daily Arts Writer
Religion is a tough plot device to wrangle
for even the hardest-boiled veteran filmmaker.
The balance of maintaining creative license and
deigning to the pressures of
the almighty Box Office is a
delicate one, and its, success-
ful maneuvering can lead to Legion
critical praise and commercial
success for the resulting film. At Quality 16
One misstep, though, can undo and Showcase
a lifetime of sincere effort. ScreenGems
Fourteen missteps, well, that
just turns into "Legion."
"Legion" is ostensibly about a boring diner
full of boring people, including a pregnant
young grouch who unknowingly carries anoth-
er Messiah in her womb. These unlikeable stock
characters ramble interminably about things
in which the audience has no interest - in one
scene, the diner's owner hits the TV to improve
the reception for what might be ten uninter-
rupted minutes - until Paul Bettany ("The Da
Vinci Code") shows up with a car trunk full of
guns and a bloody back where his wings used to
be. He's the archangel Michael, and he's here to
save us from the evil forces of God.
That's right, God is the villain in "Legion."
The Big Man Upstairs is sick of humanity turn-
ing its back on Him, and He has decided to wipe
us all out using His famous strategy of sending
angels to possess weak-willed humans like zom-
bies - an attack He hasn't employed since the
Book of Applebee's.
There's a precedent in scripture for God's dis-
satisfaction with mankind. Angels have been
characterized as warriors in films past. But
"Legion" introduces the concept that those who

everyone knew Mondays at
who they were. 10:30 p.m.
But what goes VHl
up must come
down eventu-
ally, and Salt-N-Pepa have been
down for the past decade. They
have yet to accept their slip into
the has-been abyss and instead
are making regular appearances
on VHI celebreality shows to
boost their image. Their latest
publicity stunt is an insight into
Pepa's dating life with "Let's Talk
About Pep."
Not only has Sandy "Pepa"
Denton lost her star power, but
she has also fallen off the dating
radar. After four years of celi-
bacy, she has decided to get out
there and resume the search for
Mr. Right. Apparently, this war-
rants a TV show. And what girl
wouldn't go on a man hunt with-
out her BFFs at her side?
"Let's Talk About Pep" follows
Pepa and her three besties who
fit neatly into convenient female
stereotypes. Joumana Kidd is
the sweet and compassionate
divorcee looking for some fun.
Jacque Reid is the ambitious
career woman who's ready for a
family, but doesn't want to wait
for love. That's why she's look-
ing first and foremost for.sperm.
And then there's Kali Troy, or
"Kittie" - the wild child who
went on a date to a strip club and
loved every minute of it. The four
go outwith guys and convene at
brunch to dish the details while
the cameras catch every moment.
The entertainment factor of
"Let's Talk About Pep" is based

on what females do with theil
everyday lives. There's no need to
listen to Pepa and her gang when
the girls down the hall have gos-
sip that's just as juicy. While it's
true that Pepa's dating life is a
little more exciting than most
(no one in real life is showered
with gifts on the first date), she's
not exactly starring in her own
personal romantic comedy. Still,
the creators did everything they
could to create suspense.
Each scene is accompanied
by what can only be described
as porno music - that funky
music that screams "Let's get
it on," creating the expectation
that someone will do just that.
But other than the requisite VH1
hot tub and stripper pole, "Let's
Talk About Pep" is quite tame
for a show centered on whether
or not Pepa is going to get laid.
Too cryptic to
resolve its
sexual intriguer
When that question is finally
brought to the table, Pepa coyly
refuses to divulge any details (as
though the line separating trashy
and classy hadn't already been
crossed with all the love-making
music). All that build-up with
no satisfaction makes for a total
waste of a half hour.
However, when it comes down
to the bottom line, "Let's Talk
About Pep" is fun and flirtatious
if not a little cheesy - all that it
hoped to be and nothing more
than other similar shows. Hard-
core Salt-N-Pepa fans will love
the glimpse into Pepa's personal
life, but the show doesn't explore
any deeper than her previous
forays into reality TV. It's not a
comeback by any means, but it
might beat some of Michelange-
lo's later stuff.

and the audience is expected to accept them
without question. It doesn't matter whether the
viewer believes in God; he or she deserves more
than to be thrown into a film where mankind's
traditional source of compassion and mercy
becomes a zombie warlord.
So yes, "Legion" will grossly offend any practi-
tioner of an Abrahamic faith. But it should offend
everyone else, too. It's not terribly important that
the film vilifies God so lazily when everything
else in itis such indefensible garbage.
Michael's introductory wing removal is the
crown moment of the film's idiocy. He falls out
of the sky, wings and all, in a patented Termi-

nator bubble and lands in a Los Angeles alley
before dragging a heavenly dagger across his
nipples. Apparently angels' wings are loosely
affixed at the chest, because he then appears in
a dirty bathroom with holes in his back before
moving on to a room full of automatic weapons.
Oh, you don't know about the secret gun depot
for fallen angels in Los Angeles?
Calling "Legion" stupid gives it too much
credit. Stupidity implies some innocence.
"Legion" is an aggressive defiance of reason.
It should not have gone straight to Blu-ray. It
should not have gone straight to Betamax. It
should have gone straight to Hell.

A jolt of lostlove from Eels.

A-AVEDAINSTITUTE

By BRIAN FLAHERTY
Daily Arts Writer
Now in the throes of middle age, Mark Everett is as
ambitious, forthright and melancholy as ever. Often
going by the moniker "E," the tor-
mented singer-songwriter behind
Eels confronts his experience of
divorce with potency and matu- Eels
rity in the band's latest album End
Times. Weaving a tale replete with End Times
Eels's customary themes (alienation, Vagrant
loss, insecurity and loneliness), the
album adds a dimension of social
commentary as Everett draws parallels between his
failed relationship and a society that manufactures
failed relationships.
End Times is an experiment that occasionally
wants to cry "Eureka," but often doesn't pan out. At
times, E draws gripping connections between his own
experiences with intimacy and an outer world that
lost its authenticity. When he describes "People sleep-
ing / In Hazmat suits / Taping up their window" in
"On My Feet," he makes a haunting assertion that fear
and alienation in society has invaded and spoiled his
most intimate relationships. But when Everett likens
his grief-stricken self to a suicide bomber looking for
an easy way out in "Paradise Blues," the lyrics seem to
have been written more for shock value than mean-
ingful artistic purpose.
Following six months after a previous album
that explored the topjc of desire, the 14 tracks in E's
"divorce album" gravitate between angst-filled bum-
mer-rock and intimate melodies in Everett's hypnotic
vocals. End Times's volatile blend of musical styles
adds breadth to the album but it unfortunately falls
short of coalescing into a unified work.
Sometimes the album's tracks blend and comple-
ment each other harmoniously. Other times, they
clash together in head-on collisions that just aren't
pleasant for listeners. This problem first rears its head
between the opener and second track. The album's
opener, "The Beginning," is a butterflies-and-rain-

bows indie-folk tune of a relationship in its beginning
stages. But the second track, "Gone Man," features
beefy riffs and an overpowering rhythm, both very
much discordant with the song it follows. Everett's
attempt to represent the spectrum of his relationship
is respectable, but it doesn't go off without a hitch.
Still, End Times glimmers with tracks like "A Line
In the Dirt," which recounts in beautiful melancholia
the growing distance between E and his partner, the
final argument that broke E's marriage and his weigh-
ing uncertainty over whether he would ever return
home. Spare details and subtle piano arrangements
convey the vision of the gentle, troubled artist without
devolving into sentimentalism.
In "I Heed A Mother," E's confessions border on
heartbreaking when he links his desire for an affec-
tionate relationship to the loss of his mother to can-
cer. "I been your daddy for too long of a time / Need
a little help, you know / Just once in a while," he
sings with an echo. Perhaps the best moments on the
album are those like this one - when E's confessions
of personal experience trigger nuanced, penetrating
self-assessments.
Everett offers a candid
look at his own
experience with divorce.
For a work fixated on alienation and lost love, the
album is refreshingly upbeat and honest. "Well, it's
a wonder I survive," E admits in the album's hope-
ful final track, "And I'll be all right." There's little bad
faith and no villain in the story. Rather, it's an artist
making a candid and sometimes lacerating evalu-
ation of his experiences, his former partner and his
environment. End Times may not be groundbreaking,
but it's a welcome escape from the myopic, one-sided
breakup albums that so often line store shelves.

The fact that only two of them

work out) lends a sense of realism to
"The Buried Life" - it's clear that
Playboy Mansion security doesn't

know what's going on. This sense
is heightened by the documentary-
style filming, which seems genuine
and especially appropriate for the
more contemplative moments.
As for the socially-conscious half
of the show, it's nice to see under-
privileged kids get a new computer
for their classroom. But watching
the guys swear, strip and party with
Playboy bunnies in one scene and
then talk to kids about the impor-
tance of education in the next is

jarring, no matter how well inten-
tioned they are. MTV will need to
reign in their wild sides - or at least
commit to more substantial acts of
generosity - if the network wants
to reconcile the split personalities
of "The Buried Life."
If MTV really wantsto update its

"The Buried Life" is a decent start-
ing point. Now all it needs is more
maturity - so put your pants back

WATER POLO
*Wolverines impress
in opening weekend

Penalties plague Michigan in split

Michigan becomes
first program to
notch 250 wins in
modern era
By JAMES BLUM
For theDaily
Coach Matt Anderson was
screaming, dual-fist pumping and
jumping for joy on the floor of Can-
ham Natatorium. The Wolverine
bench displayed a similar senti-
ment as the pool room exploded
with a beautiful cacophony of
cheers.
The excitement was for red-
shirt senior goalie Brittany May
whose stunning performance led
the 10th-ranked Wolverines water
polo team over the seventh-ranked
Aztecs of San Diego State, 9-4.
"There was one save I didn't
think I even made," May said. "I
looked at Coach and saw his face
and thought maybe I just saved
that shot."
Hold your seahorses: Michigan
water polo is officially underway.
The Michigan Wolverines host-
ed the fifth annual Michigan Kick-
off this weekend at the Canham
Natatorium, and over the course of
two grueling days, the Wolverines
finished with an impressive 3-1
record.
Michigan (3-1) opened strong,
winning its first two games on Sat-
urday against UC San Diego (0-4)
and Colorado State (0-4).
In a closer-than-anticipated sea-
son-opener against unranked UC
San Diego, the Wolverines pulled
out an 11 - 8 victory. The game
marked the first career goals of
freshmen Kiki Golden and Lauren

Colton, both of whom would prove
to be major players over the course
of the invitational.
In the process of leading Michi-
gan to a win, senior captain Leah
Robertson tallied her 300th career
steal, continuing her record-break-
ing career.
"It is pretty exciting," Robertson
said. "I think it is just a testament
to the talented players I have got-
ten to play with over the last four
years and the solid defensive foun-
dation that coach Matt (Anderson)
has instilled upon us."
After scraping by UC San Diego,
the Wolverines brought their all
against a Colorado State team
that could not compete. Michigan
grabbed an early seven-point lead
after one quarter, putting up an
impressive nine opening-period
goals, four of which came from
Colton.
"We're on the
same level as
them now."
"We call her Coltan the Cobra,"
coach Anderson said. "She has the
ability to strike like a Cobra."
Her venom took only eight min-
utes to down the Rams.
The win brought Michigan to
2-0 and also helped Michigan
become the first women's water
polo team since the establishment
of the NCAA tournament in 2001 to
reach 250 wins.

The M


Devin Gardner is not
next year's savior

So, Devin Gardner is officially on
campus - but be careful what you
wish for, Wolverine fans. He's not
the answer for next season.
Sure, he's tal-
ented, and his
running abili-
ties are a step
up compared
to Tate Forcier
in Rich Rodri-
guez's spread-
option attack.
Sure, in a few ANDY
years, with his REID
natural athletic
ability, Gardner
has the potential to leave his mark
on Michigan football history.
But he needs to sit next year.
If Gardner doesn't redshirt -
which would make him the first
quarterback in the Rodriguez era
with enough time to fully learn
the complicated offensive scheme
before being thrust onto the field
- it's going to negatively affect the
quality of the position in the long
run.
And, if you think about it, the
best possible scenario for the Wol-
verines would be if they were in a
position to sit Gardner, anyway.
That would mean that Forcier
continues to progress through the
spring and summer, becoming
more comfortable in the pocket and
reading defenses.
It would mean that he gets big-
ger, stronger and faster in another
year of strength and conditioning
under coordinator Mike Barwis's
rigid system.
And it would mean Michigan has
some consistency at the quarter-
back position - not another over-
whelmed first-year starter. That's
something maize-and-blue fans
completely took for granted during
Chad Henne's illustrious career. Or
even John Navarre's for that mat-
ter, though some might not look on
him fondly.
Next season, then, Denard Rob-
inson should stay at quarterback
- for at least one more year. He's
not the best option, but, barring

an injury to Forcier in which case
you could burn Gardner's redshirt
if it became necessary. He's a solid
backup quarterback with a great
change-of-pace running style.
That way, Gardner has two
seasons (2011 and '12) to back up
Forcier and play a Denard-like,
two-drive-a-game role (and, who
knows, possibly wrestle the start-
ing job away from him) and learn
the offense the right way.
Wolverine nation, I understand
that you're upset and want to win
right now. But Gardner isn't the
answer - this season.
How is another freshman quar-
terback going to solve anything?
He's talented, but the "freshman
moments" that plagued Forcier
last season aren't going to just
magically disappear. Henne was
an exception, not the norm, and
a freshman Gardner - no matter
how many Vince Young compari-
sons are thrown around by over-
excited national recruiting analysts
- would have plenty of cringe-wor-
thy mistakes if he's forced to start
next season.
Give him time to learn the
offense.
I think Rodriguez knows that
this would be the right decision.
But I'm worried that, under the
extreme pressure to perform in his
third season the helm, the coach
will be forced to make bold and
rash choices, including pulling the
gun on his ace recruit, which would
hinder not only Gardner's develop-
ment but also the team's future.
And it's not like the alternative is
a bad move.
I have full confidence that Forci-
er is going to be a good quarterback
at Michigan. He's got the skills,
poise and moxie to lead this offense,
given he has a talented surrounding
cast, which the Wolverines should
have next season.
I know it's tough, but hang in
there. PlayingGardner prematurely
would prove to be a very bad move.

By CAITLIN SMITH
DailySports Writer
Junior Chris Cameron ended his
routine, let out a shout of enthusi-
asm while holding up a victorious
fist and sprinted over toa line of his
teammates, waiting for high-fives.
It was only the first rotation, but
Cameron celebrated his 15.40 floor
performance as if he knew the
Wolverines were going to finish
the day with a win.
No. 3 Michigan did indeed

beat No. 6 Penn State in front of
a crowd of nearly 700 fans. Last
year, the Wolverines fell to the Nit-
tany Lions by just hundredths of
a point. But yesterday, Michigan
held a comfortable 10-point lead
throughout most of the match and
finished off with a total score of
355.65 to 344.75.
Though the Wolverines had a
shaky start to the season at last
weekend's Windy City Invitation-
al, they proved yesterday that they
deserve their third-place ranking.
"A lot of the time there is a tre-
mendous improvement between
meet one and meet two," Michigan
coach Kurt Golder said. "You kind
of knock the rust off and you figure
out some things about competing
again that you've learned a few
times before."

Cameron and junior Thomas
Kelley led Michigan in scoring.
Kelley took first place in both the.
horizontal bar and still rings, and
finished third on the floor event.
Cameron finished first on the floor
and second on both the pommel
horse and the parallel bars. He also
won the all-around competition
with a score of88.75.
Senior Mel Anton Santander
also performed well against the
Nittany Lions. Santander recorded
a top-three finish in two out of his
four events, and set a career best on
the pommel horse with a 14.95.
"Mel was just super," Golder
said. "I think he will be an All-
American this year. He's been on
a roll since the NCAA finals last
season and hopefully he can just
continue that through the rest of

the year because we need his help."
Golder gave the Newt Loken
Outstanding Performance award
to Santander for his strong routine
on the horse.
This award is given to a Wol-
verine after each meet, in honor
of long-time Michigan gymnastics
coach, Newt Loken.
Though Santander was proud
of his performance against Penn
State, he doesn't plan on becoming
complacent anytime soon.
"It's my senior year and it'sgreat
to come out strong in the beginning
for the first home meet," Santander
said. "However, I wanted to add
a couple more skills into my rou-
tines, to add more difficulty and
get a higher start value. Hopefully
that will help the team even more
than I did today."

Less than a month ago in the
Great Lakes Invitational, a puck
bounced off his glove and into the
net as Hogan's mistake put the
game nearly out of reach. In Sat-
urday's first period against Ferris
State, Ewigleben Ice Arena was
already preheating.
In a goal that was eerily similar
to the one that got him pulled in
the GLI, a manageable wristshot
from the top of the circle found its
way just above Hogan's left pad and
under his glove.
But despite his history, Hogan
didn't crumble in the heat created
by the Ferris student section locat-
ed behind his net.
 He rebounded from the early
goal Saturday to return to his Fri-
day-night shutout form, making 29
stops and keepingMichiganwithin
reach of the Bulldogs.
"He gave us a chance to win,
that's all you can ask for a goalie to
 do," senior defenseman Chris Sum-
mers said.
After getting a lot of defensive

help on Friday en route to his third
shutout of the season, Hogan was
forced to make two saves on break-
aways to keep it tied at 1-1 midway
through the game Saturday.
With eight minutes left, Ferris
State's Casey Haines drove around
sophomore defensemen Brandon
Burlon, only to meet Hogan's poke
check.
About three minutes later, a
long pass out of the Bulldogs' zone
beat freshman Lee Moffie and left
Hogan one-on-one with the shoot-
er. Hogan got his left pad on the
backhand shot, and after a late goal
in the second that occurred when
Hogan had to contend with traffic
in front, the Wolverines escaped
the period down by just one.
"Hogan kept us in the game,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said. "We got great chances and
their goalie played well. Both goal-
ies played well. I didn't think we
finished."
The Wolverines finally capital-
ized on one of their many scoring
opportunities' with just over two
minutes remaining. But Hogan's
work wasn't finished as he was
forced into the spotlight one final
time as Michigan took a penalty 14
seconds later.
With just 24 seconds left, a one-

timer from the high slot trickled
through Hogan's legs into the net
for the final goal, winning the game
and overshadowing Hogan's stellar
weekend in the net.
"It was heartbreaking for our
team after battling back from a def-
icit and tying the game in the last
minute and a half," Berenson said.
"It's a tough pill to swallow because
we're right back in the game and
we have the momentum."
A day before, Hogan didn't feel
the heat, stopping 22 shots in a
shutout of the top offense in the
CCHA.
It was the sixth of his career.
In a low-scoring game, it was the
defensive effort that made the dif-
ference.
"Hogie played outstanding
tonight, stood on his head, made
some bigsaves forus," senior defen-
semen Steve Kampfer said after
Friday's game. "To shutdown that
(Blair) Riley kid was a huge step for
us. That was our goal all week."
Even with the 'oven ready'
light off, the red light behind the
net ultimately stayed on, despite
Hogan's play in front of it. Even

Wolverines avenge
early loss to Indiana

Beam dooms Blue again

With lead for most of
match, Michigan
loses to Nebraska
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
Entering their final rotation, the
No. 16 Michigan women's gymnas-
tics team held a meager lead, but
with just three performers left,
their Achilles' heel once more led
to their downfall.
The Wolverines led by one tenth
of a point as they approached the
balance beam. All three Wolverines
toppled off to give No. 9 Nebraska
a 196.025-194.725 home victory on
Sunday.
"Obviously, overall I'm disap-
pointed because we didn't hit beam
again," Michigan coach Bev Plocki
said. "But that being said, I was
very pleased with the other three
events."
The event almost led to a similar
demise in last Wednesday's contest
against Michigan State, when three
falls from atop the beam almost
gave the Spartans a late victory.
"Thebeam is definitelyour prob-

lem area, and has been our problem
area for the last couple meets,"
junior Kylee Botterman said.
"We're disappointed. We're upset.
We just need to find the swing of
things, and we just haven't found
it yet. We have such talented girls
on beam, we just need to find what
works for us to hit six-for-six every
time."
Even with the slips, a few ath-
letes stepped up and competed
very well in an underdog role on the
road. Senior captain Kelsey Knut-
son took first place on the beam,
and freshman Natalie Beilstein was
runner-up on the vault.
Botterman had the strongest
showing ofthe afternoon, pacing the
team by winning the individual title
on the uneven bars, taking two sec-
ond-place spots and capturing the
all-around award with a 39.350 total.
"Kylee had a great meet every-
where," Plocki said. "She is a very
powerful athlete, so she was able to
adapt to equipment changes pretty
well."
Against such a high-profile
squad in Nebraska, it was essential
for an all-around athlete to show-
case her talents.
"It wasn't my best day by any

means," Botterman said. "ButI had
four solid performances, and I'm
happy with that. I'm glad that I can
contribute for my team when they
need me."
As a team, Michigan (2-0 Big
Ten, 3-1 Overall) set season-bests
on the floor exercise, despite some
differences with the equipment in
Nebraska (4-0). Both players and
coaches agreed that warm-ups
were not crisp due to the challenge
of overcoming the floor exercise
mat.
"The equipment here was very
different," Plocki said. "I thought
that the athletes did a great job
from warm-ups adjusting to the
equipment and coming through
to perform like we did in the first
three events."
Looking ahead to their next
meet - a tri-meet matchup in Iowa
against Iowa State and BYU next
Friday - the Wolverines under-
stand that they have plenty of ele-
ments to refine.
"We just have to continue to
keep working," Plocki said. "We
need to reevaluate the lineup and
make sure we're practicing under
pressure and are just preparing
ourselves to get better."

The Michigan women's basket-
ball team was up by 14 points with
just14 seconds remainingin its game
against
Indiana INDIANA 56
at Crisler MICHIGAN 70
Arena yes-
terday, and it was safe to say they
would come out victorious.
But that didn't stop senior Krista
Phillips from diving for a loose ball
when freshmen guard Dayeesha
Hollins overthrew a pass to Phil-
lips. The result of the hustle play
wouldn't change the final result, but
Phillips dove regardless.
Even though the ball rolled out
of bounds and the effort failed, the
Wolverines certainly did not, notch-
ing a 70-56 win and showing their
dedication along the way.
"I was laughing for the last 15
seconds of the game," sophomore
forward Carmen Reynolds said.
"We are taught to always dive for
the ball, give it your all and grab it.
So that's what she did."
Michigan (3-6 Big Ten, 11-8 over-
all) hasn't had much to laugh about
recently. The win ended a three-
game losing streak and was the
team's first against Indiana in six
tries.
But when the Wolverines were
down 27-22 at halftime, Michigan
went to the locker room with expec-
tations of a victory kept in check.

The Wolverines are all-too famil-
iar with mediocre first-half perfor-
mances and they weren't going to
settle for another close loss, espe-
cially after losing their last two
games by a combined five points.
In their last game against Indiana
(4-5, 11-9) less than two weeks ago,
Michigan was down by as much as
11 in the first half before they came
back in the second.
But when a layup at the buzzer
that would have sent the game into
overtime rolled out of the rim, the
Wolverines dropped the comeback
effort.
And this time, it was halftime
modifications that saved the Wol-
verines from another loss.
"(At halftime) we decided to
push the ball, penetrate and keep
the lane open," Hollins said. "We
had noticed that the lane was pretty
much wide open and our goal (in the
second half) was to penetrate. For
me to get myself involved was easy
when the lane was wide open."
Hollins did just that. And with no
one in the Indiana post to block her
under the basket, Hollins was able
to score 6 points in the paint in the
second half.
Fastbreaks by Hollins and junior
guard Veronica Hicks within a min-
ute of each other opened the second
half and set the pace for the remain-
ing20 minutes.
Michigan went on a 20-7 run to
take an eight-point lead. The Wol-
verines never looked back from


there, improving their lead to 20
with two minutes remaining.
"In the locker room we all looked
at each other and had kind of a 'not
again' moment," freshman guard
Jenny Ryan said. "We were like,
'We've been through this, we know
what it'slike to lose and we don't want
to do it again.' You could sense it that
we justweren't losing this game."
Michigan's lead ballooned with
help from Hicks, who got hot from
behind the arc in the second half.
She finished the game with a game-
high24 points, 20 inthe second half.
Reynolds led the team in 3-pointers
with four, two of which were Michi-
gan's only 3-pointers in the first half.
Ryan picked up her game in the
second half as well. After a couple of
misread passes in the first, she fin-
ished with a game-high 11 rebounds.
"It was just one thing after anoth-
er," Ryan said. "Once it's done it's
done, I can't go back and fix it. So
when I came out in the second half
I knew the first half was over and I
just wanted to play from there."
With their record and tenth-place
ranking in the Big Ten, Michigan
must string together a few consecu-
tive victories in order to entertain
thoughts of postseason play.
But with the pressure off, the
Wolverines can just look ahead one
game at a time.
"Words cannot describe that
we are back on a winning streak,"
Reynolds said. "Hopefully we will
be able to continue that in Illinois."


Ohio State ends Wolverines
25-year win streak in rivalry

Brunemann leads
Blue with two
victories, but team
loses in dual meet
By FELIX CARREON
Daily Sports Writer
Heading into this weekend's
matchup with Ohio State, the
Michigan women's swimming and
diving team hadn't lost a dual meet
to the Buckeyes in 25 years.
Since 1985, the Wolverines have
won 16 consecutive dual meets
against Ohio State and they were
looking to extend that streak
against their rivals this weekend.
But despite a strong perfor-
mance from fifth-year senior
Emily Brunemann, Michigan was
on the wrong end of a dominant-
ing performance, falling 162-132 in
Columbus.
Brunemann led a fatigued
Wolverine squad into McCorkle
Aquatic Pavilion with three event
victories. The fifth-year senior
captured event victories in the
1000-yard freestyle and the 500-
yard freestyle. The distance
specialist also displayed her ver-
satility, touching the wall first in
the 400-yard individual medley,
an event she's been itching to com-
pete in.
"My freestyle is kind of tired
right now which is evident in my
1000 and 500," Brunemann said.
"And normally when my freestyle
is tired, my 400 (individual med-
ley) is pretty good."

After a strong performance last
weekend against Northwestern,
senior Margaret Kelly stepped up
once again. Kelly won the 100-yard
backstroke but came in a close sec-
ond in the 200-yard backstroke,
losing by nearly five tenths of a
second.
"I don't care if you play Ohio
State in tiddlywinks or football or
swimming," Richardson, who had
never lost to Ohio State in his 25
years as head of the program, said.
"Anytime you compete with Ohio
State, you're part of the greatest
rivalry in the sport. If you pay the
price on Monday, Wednesday and
Thursday sometimes you don't
have a whole lot to give on Satur-
day.
"I don't have any complaints
about the effort we gave."
But the Wolverines didn't leave
Columbus empty-handed. They
made progress in fulfilling the
lack of depth at breaststroke.
Freshman Julia Andracki
started the 200-yard breaststroke
strong, leading with 50 yards to
go in the race. At that point, fresh-
man Mattie Kukors was in fourth
place. But then, she stole the spot-
light. Kukors finished the final 50
yards in 35.39 seconds, coming
in eight hundredths of a second
ahead of second place. Andracki
wasn't far behind, grabbing
fourth place.
Michigan also received a strong
performance from sophomore
Alexa Mehesan. She captured an
event victory in the 100-yard but-
terfly and finished second in the
100-yard backstroke.
Despite some individual suc-

cess, Brunemann lamented the
streak's end.
"I was pretty disappointing
because we haven't lost that meet
since 1985," Brunemann said. "I
know it was a dual meet but our
main focus is Big Tens and I know
we're going to be really prepared
to kick butt there."

rady likely to rejoin basketball team-

Beilein says Grady
will remain on foot-
ball team, practice
with basketball
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
WEST LAFAYETTE - Current
Michigan football player and for-
mer Michigan basketball player
Kelvin Grady has met with coach
John Beilein
about the possi- NOTEBOOK
bility of return-
ing to basketball, Beilein said in a
press conference after the team's
69-59 loss to Purdue on Saturday.
"Kelvin contacted us, asked if
he could help us out," Beilein said.
"We're having trouble on scout
teams, guarding quickness. Kel-
vin's volunteered to help us as a
scout team guy. That's probably all
it will be."
Beileinsaid Grady would remain
on the football team, and that they
would have to work around sched-
uling conflicts with spring football
practicen.
"He'n not giving up football,"
Beilein naid. "He known our nys-
tem. He's asked us to do it. We
talked with him. We love Kelvin,
and we said, 'You know what, we
can use that.'"
A short bench and inexperience
at point guard mean Grady's see-
ing playing time this season isn't
entirely out of the question, espe-
cially considering the Wolverines
have had three recent departures.
Walk-on Eric Puls left the team
in December to focus on his engi-
neering degree while redshirt
sophomore Ben Cronin's playing
career is likely over - the 7-footer
left the team due to complications
from a surgery he had on his hip
last season.
And most recently, freshman

the reserves took plenty of shots,
especially with junior guard
Manny Harris suspended.
But they had essentially the
same effect, going a combined
5-for-13 for the game, with most
of those made shots coming when
the game's outcome was all but
decided. They also went 0-for-4
from beyond the arc.
Senior forward DeShawn Sims
took all of Michigan's shots for the
first seven minutes of the game.
He made most of them, but it
meant a lot of standing around for
the rest of the Wolverine offense,
which struggled once called upon
to shoot.
"I think that pressure that
they put on us in the first half, we
weren't used to it and that's hard
to substitute in practice for the
new guys like me and Matt," Mor-
ris said. "But at halftime, we made
adjustments. ... I think we just
learned a little too late."
EARLY GLASS TROUBLES: It's
no secret that the Wolverines have
struggled to grab rebounds all sea-
son. They've been outrebounded
in nearly every game.
But during Saturday's game
against Purdue, it became painful-
ly obvious how offennive rebounds
can be game-changern.
In the first half, Michigan shot
55 percent from the field, compa-
rable to Purdue's 58 percent.
But the Boilermakers' seven
offensive rebounds gave Purdue
a multitude of chances to build a
16-point lead by the half. In fact,
in the first half, the Boilermakers
had more offensive rebounds than
the Wolverines had total rebounds
with six, all defensive.
Even though the second half
brought better results on the
boards, Michigan's first-half
struggles had already given Pur-
due complete control of the game.
The stat sheet might have looked
better by game's end, but the dam-
age had been done early.

On Saturday against Purdue,


With Harris out, Blue
struggles to find scorers

By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Editor
WEST LAFAYETTE - It's never
good to go into a key matchup on
the road missing any players. But
without the Big Ten's leading scor-
er - junior forward Manny Harris
- Michigan's chances to upset No.
15 Purdue seemed handcuffed from
the get-go.
Citing "an act of unsportsman-
like conduct," Michigan coach John
Beilein announced that he had sus-
pended Harris before Saturday's
game at Purdue. Harris had started
in 85 straight contests.
"Manny has made great strides
both on and off the court over the
last three years," Beilein said in
a statement through the athletic
department. "Unfortunately he
used poor judgment on Friday. We
will meet with Manny and the team
again when we return to determine
if he has learned enough from this
suspension to rejoin the team for
Tuesday's game. I am confident
that this learning experience will
be valuable in the future to both
Manny and our basketball pro-
gram."
But it was clear that without
their .star in action, it would be a
long day for the Wolverines.
Michigan struggled without
Harris, particularly in the first
half. With redshirt junior Anthony
Wright starting, the Wolverines
couldn't find a scorer to comple-
ment senior forward DeShawn
Sims.
In fact, Sims scored the team's
first 13 points. And it wasn't until
sophomore Zack Novak hit a
3-pointer with 7:28 to play in the
first half that someone other than
Sims had even registered a point.
"I think early on we were pret-
ty darn good getting the ball to
DeShawn Sims," Beilein said. "I
mean really good getting the ball
to DeShawn, then they shut some-
thing down that we were doing and
for usnto adapt, it was difficult."
Perhaps the biggest challenge
for Michigan was being forced to
adapt to Harris's absence just one

to at least get a good shot. With-
out his security blanket-like pres-
ence, the Wolverines looked lost
at times near the end of the shot
clock.
Harris is the only player on
the team (I'm excluding fresh-
man Darius Morris, who certainly
seems to have the skills to be a
playmaker, because he still seems
about a year away) who can consis-
tently take his man off the dribble
and create open shots with the ball
in his hands.
He is an invaluable asset - a
player who can create his own
shot - particularly so for Michi-
gan, which doesn't have a wealth
of those kinds of players.
So does this mean Michigan,
which will in all likelihood lose
Harris to the NBA in the summer,
is doomed next season?
No, no, no.
It means Michigan, as it should,
struggled without one of its stars.
Does it mean Michigan relies on
Manny a little too much?
Probably, but that's normal for
a team with a player of Manny's
caliber.

Junior Manny Harris was suspended from Saturday's game against Purdue.

day after the incident at practice
took place. As the Big Ten's lead-
ing scorer, any gameplan is going to
involve Harris, but with little time
to adjust their strategy, Michigan
really struggled keeping pace.
"Outside of guarding DeShawn
Sims for the first 20 minutes, we
did a really good job guarding
everyone else," Purdue coach Matt
Painter said. "They obviously took a
huge blow with Manny not playing
this game, and that's 20 points just
ripped off your lines. It's a difficult
thing to count on somebody and
they're not there."
And in many cases it seemed that
Michigan's only option was to force
it to Sims, even when he wasn't
there.
"I think I was really looking to
get the ball to DeShawn," Wright
said. "That was pretty much my
first option."
It wasn't until the second half
that Michigan finally found that

alternate scorer, but by then Purdue
was firmly in control of the game,
stretching their lead to as many as
27 points.
Novak contributed 16 points for
the Wolverines on 6-for-11 shoot-
ing, but scored 13 of those in the
second half when Michigan was
already out of the game. Perhaps
more important, without Harris in
the lineup, the Wolverines forced
their offense, committing 15 turn-
overs, and losing the rebound battle
to Purdue 16-6 in the first half.
It wasn't the first time Harris
has created mid-season contro-
versy. Last year, Beilein benched
his star in a key overtime game
against Iowa - which Michigan
lost - down the stretch when the
Wolverines were chasing an NCAA
Tournament berth.
Beilein has not announced
whether Harris will play against
the Spartans. He said it would be a
team decision.

PURDUE
From page 1B
juniors Robbie Hummel,
E'Twuan Moore and Johnson
combined for 37 points on 16-of-
25 shooting in the first frame. The
Boilermakers tallied 13 assists in
that span, easily working around
the Wolverines' defensive pack-
ages and cutting to the rim for
layups.
"We just had trouble with how
efficient they are on offense,"
Beilein said of Purdue's 22-5 run
in the first half that blew the
game open. "There's not a whole
lot of people that can even come
here and get 60 points (to keep
up)."
And with Purdue throwing
extra defenders at Sims to disrupt
him in the post, Michigan's four-
guard lineup - without Harris -
looked helpless. The Wolverines
turned the ball over nine times
in the first half, which helped
Purdue generate 10 more shot
attempts.
"They're so stingy," Beilein
said. "You can call whatever you
want in the huddle, and they're
going to make you run something
else. So countering and reading
it and doing things like that very
quickly. Very experienced play-
ers can do it, and we had trouble
with it.
"You really have to have great
experience to be able to handle
that."
Novak said the Wolverines'

first-half turnovers were the dif-
ference in the game, and that the
team had a lot of problems against
a defense so fiercely dedicated to
"pass denial." Even simple fun-
damentals like reversing the ball
around the perimeter looked at
times like a chore.
Purdue's lead swelled to as
many as 27 points in the second
half before Michigan took advan-
tage of the Boilermakers' reserves
and closed the gap to 10 in the final
score.
The team saw some silver lin-
ing in the fact that role players like
redshirt-junior Anthony Wright
and freshman Matt Vogrich saw
extended time.
In the context of a puzzling
season growing dimmer for the
Wolverines with each loss, the

team tried to muster up some
shreds of optimism after its latest
setback.
"This is definitely a game we
can grow from, because it gives
people a lot of valuable time,"
Novak said. "Give them credit.
Guys from the bench fought back,
and we didn't just roll over and
die."
But in the end, the post-game
focus was on Harris, who had
played in all 85 career games
before staying behind when the
team traveled to Purdue. With no
one to slash to the basket or snag
