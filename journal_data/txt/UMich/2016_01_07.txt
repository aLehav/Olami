Members teach 
incoming recruits 

how to fox trot, 
swing and rumba

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
12-time 
national 

championship-winning 
Michigan 
Ballroom 
Dance 

Team 
opened 
its 
doors 

Wednesday 
evening 
to 

newcomers 
interested 
in 

joining the group this semester.

Students who attended the 

meeting learned the basics of 
ballroom dance, including how 
to swing and foxtrot. Amid 
lessons on how to dance, the 
team also showcased some of 
their best dancers.

The center of the Rogel 

Ballroom quickly filled with 
over 250 students as the lesson 
began by separating attendees 
by gender. First, the males 

were taught step by step how 
to lead a basic swing dance. As 
current members demonstrated 
the dance, the female side was 
then instructed.

“It was a lot easier than I 

expected, and I want more” 
said 
LSA 
freshman 
Erica 

Edwards “My friends on the 
team have been begging me to 
come out and give it a try and 
after seeing how fun it was, I’m 
definitely considering it.” 

Soon 
after 
experienced 

members 
finished 
teaching 

their planned steps, the team 
moved on to a showcase of 
their more seasoned members. 
It 
opened 
with 
a 
rumba 

performed by LSA sophomore 
Jenelle Rofe and Art & Design 
junior Jonny Pang. The couple 
has performed on the national 
level. Prior to joining the 
Ballroom Dance Team both had 
no experience whatsoever.

Rofe said her time on the 

team has been rewarding and 
has given her opportunities 

Barbour and 
Newberry 

residents respond 
to center’s move

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

A planned relocation of 

the 
Trotter 
Multicultural 

Center to Central Campus has 
garnered mixed reactions from 
the 
University 
community 

ranging from excitement to 
apprehension. 

Dec. 17, the University’s 

Board of Regents approved 
a proposal to relocate the 
Trotter 
Multicultural 

Center, currently located on 
Washtenaw Avenue, to State 
Street in an area behind Betsy 
Barbour and Helen Newberry 
Residence Halls on Central 
Campus.

In Winter 2014, the Black 

Student Union called for the 
relocation of Trotter as part 

of the #BBUM movement — 
a 
student-driven 
campaign 

sharing the experiences of 
Black students on campus.

After the years of public 

discourse on the issue, many 
students lauded the approval, 
including Rackham student 
Austin McCoy. 

McCoy, a leader of Ann Arbor 

to Ferguson, a protest group 
advocating 
against 
police 

brutality, said he welcomed 
the accessibility and visibility 
of the new location. He noted 
that replacing the current 
multicultural center with a 
facility on Central Campus 
illustrates the importance of 
issues of inclusion and equity. 

“I 
think 
students 
of 

color 
and 
some 
various 

underrepresented 
backgrounds need to have a 
space that’s more accessible 
than 
on 
the 
margins 
of 

campus,” McCoy said. “I think 
Trotter’s 
current 
location 

actually 
symbolizes 
how 

students 
feel 
marginalized

DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY

Boilermakers’ stout 

defense matches 
up with Michigan’s 

sharpshooters

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

John Beilein says he doesn’t 

decide until a season’s end which 
games are more important than 
the rest. It seems safe to assume, 
however, that Thursday’s trip to 
No. 20 Purdue (1-1 Big Ten, 13-2 
overall) will make the list. 

It’s 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team’s 
(2-0, 
12-3) 

second visit of the year to a team 
ranked in the top 25. The first 
one — an 82-58 shellacking at the 
hands of then-No. 19 Southern 
Methodist — left plenty of room 
for improvement.

“You all can just go through 

your books,” Beilein said. “How 
many times has Michigan beaten 
a ranked opponent on the road? 
You won’t find very many times. I 
don’t care who the coaches were 
and who the players were. It is 
difficult to do.”

It 
won’t 
help 
if 
senior 

guard 
Caris 
LeVert 
remains 

unavailable as he recovers from 
an unspecified injury to his lower 
left leg. The plan, Beilein said, 
was for LeVert to attempt to 
practice Wednesday and do the 
same Thursday in West Lafayette 
prior to tipoff. Beilein declined 
to elaborate further on LeVert’s 
status or the nature of his injury, 
saying only that LeVert will play 
if he can practice without pain 
prior to tipoff.

With 
or 
without 
LeVert, 

Purdue’s 
perimeter 
defense 

presents a tall task. Though 
Michigan 
shooters 
such 
as 

redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan Robinson have excelled 
in recent games from beyond the 
3-point line, the Boilermakers’ 
size from top to bottom will likely 
create a space crunch for the 
Wolverines. Michigan is shooting 
42.8 percent from beyond the arc 
as a team, but Purdue is holding 
opponents to 28.3 percent 3-point 
shooting.

To 
combat 
the 
size 

disadvantage, Michigan has been 
practicing with sticks and pads 
that extend defenders’ reach by 
inches or even feet.

Snyder accepts 

resignations of key 

city officials in 
light of issue

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

After 
building 
concern 

about 
water 
quality 
and 

public 
outcry, 
Gov. 
Rick 

Snyder (R) declared a state 
of emergency for Genesee 
County Tuesday.

The move comes as part 

of an effort by the state 
to provide restitution for 
the health damages Flint’s 
residences experienced due 
to tainted water and ensure 
the city’s water safety in the 

future. Snyder had previously 
accepted the resignation of 
Dan Wyant, director of the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Environmental Quality, on 
Dec. 29. Brad Wurfel, the 
public information officer 
for 
the 
Department 
of 

Environmental Quality, also 
resigned.

Daily Staff Reporter

From helping on campaigns to 
running for office, University 
students are making an impact 
in politics, often with the 
help of classes focused on the 

election process.

University alum Zachary 

Ackerman, who graduated in 
the fall 2015 semester with 
a political science degree, 
is indeed making an impact 
in the city of Ann Arbor. He 
ran for city office this past 
November and defeated four-
term 
incumbent 
Stephen 

Kunselman, 
making 
him 

the youngest member of the 
council.

Ackerman’s age was an 

initial challenge during his 
campaign, but it forced him

Salary raises proposed for Ann Arbor mayor, council members
Salary raises proposed for Ann Arbor mayor, council members

Pay will increase 
by one percent 
for numerous 
city leaders by 

February

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

For the first time in seven 

years, Ann Arbor’s mayor and 
City Council are slated to get 
a raise.

The 
increase, 
proposed 

by the city’s Local Officers’ 
Compensation 
Commission, 

amounts to about a 1 percent 
bump 
in 
each 
official’s 

respective 
salaries 
— 
a 

monthly increase of $35 for 
Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor and a $13 monthly 

increase for all 10 City Council 
members.

The LOCC, a seven-member 

body appointed by the mayor 
and council, suggested the 
increase in a memo before 
Monday’s 
City 
Council 

meeting. 
The 
change 
will 

automatically take effect 30 
days 
after 
LOCC’s 
memo, 

unless 
two-thirds 
of 
city 

council 
members 
vote 
in 

objection.

The 
memo 
proposed 

that annual pay for Mayor 
Christopher Taylor be raised 
to $42,860. Additionally, it 
recommended that the annual 
pay for council members be 
adjusted to $16,073. Currently, 
Taylor makes $42,436 and 
City Council members make 
$15,913.50 annually.

Though the city’s charter 

states 
that 
members 
of 

Council — with the exception 

of the mayor — should serve 
without compensation, state 
law allows cities to establish 
an LOCC, which can then 
supersede salary provisions 
in city charters. Under the 
state law, these changes do not 
require voter approval, unlike 
changes to the city charter. 

If 
the 
raise 
goes 
into 

effect, 
the 
mayor 
and 

councilmembers’ salaries will 
collectively total $203,587 for 
each of the next two years, 
a 
$2,000 
overall 
increase 

compared to previous years.

City 
Council 
members 

gave no indication that they 
objected the proposed change 
in compensation at Monday’s 
meeting.

“This pay raise is just one 

more cup of coffee at one 
more 
meeting,” 
said 
City 

Councilmember Sabra Briere 
(D-Ward 1). “It’s not a big 

deal.”

Taylor, who nominated a 

majority of LOCC’s current 
appointees, 
said 
he 
was 

willing to accept whatever 
determination the commission 
made, whether that was an 
increase or decrease in pay.

In an interview Wednesday, 

Briere said the LOCC did 
not disclose to City Council 
members the criteria used to 
determine the 1 percent pay 
raise.

She added that the body 

had asked councilmembers to 
report how much time they 
spent doing their jobs prior 
to meeting in December. The 
LOCC meets every two years 
to discuss pay changes.

Briere said that this was the 

first time she had ever been 
asked to explain how much 
time she spent working for the 
community, and that she had 

reported working about 30 
hours weekly and about 90 to 
110 hours monthly.

“Honestly, I didn’t feel I was 

being underpaid,” Briere said. 
“I’m not in this for the money. 
The 
money 
is 
convenient, 

especially at this point in my 
life, but I didn’t run for office 
expecting to make money. I 
ran for office expecting to 
work.”

City 
Councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D-Ward 
4) echoed Briere’s sentiment 
about the increases.

“I don’t think any of us are 

in it for the money,” Ackerman 
said. “We’re all in it to serve 
the community. I know I 
certainly am.”

Pay increases for the mayor 

were more common in past 
years, which saw the mayor’s 
salary rise from $18,300 for 
then-mayor John Hieftje in 

2000 to its current level of 
$42,436 in 2009.

Yearly 
pay 
for 

councilmembers saw a similar 
trend, rising from $9,200 in 
1997 to its currently level of 
$15,913.50 in 2009.

The 
rest 
of 
the 
city’s 

employees 
have 
also 
seen 

increases, 
ranging 
from 

between 1-3 percent in the 
past four years. Before that, 
from 2009 to 2012, most 
city 
employees 
saw 
little 

to no pay increases as the 
city 
experienced 
budget 

challenges. Some voluntarily 
accepted decreases in pay in 
order to help close budget 
gaps, such as the Ann Arbor 
firefighters, who experienced 
a 3 percent pay decrease in 
2010.

within the University.”

While 
McCoy 
added 

that 
he 
supported 
the 

administration’s decision, he 
emphasized that the driving 
force behind the change was 
student activism.

“For the University to follow 

through on that demand is 
a 
welcomed 
development, 

but I also think that this is 
an example of how student 
activism works,” McCoy said. 
“If it weren’t for the years of 
student activists, I don’t think 
this would’ve happened.”

Echoing 
McCoy’s 

sentiment, 
Elizabeth 

James, 
a 
Department 
of 

Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies 
program 
associate 

and adviser to the Black 
Student 
Union, 
expressed 

feelings of relief and joy in 
response to the approval. She 
also highlighted the symbolic 
nature 
of 
the 
relocation, 

seeing it as representative of 
the University community’s 
commitment to diversity.

“By relocating the new 

Trotter to the heart of Central 
Campus, we are saying that 
we want everyone to feel this 
is an inclusive campus and 
that this is a University that 
will provide a welcoming 
environment for all of our 
students, regardless of race, 
creed or color,” James wrote 
in an e-mail to the Daily.

However, 
while 
many 

community 
members 

commend the development, 
others 
have 
hesitated 
in 

supporting the relocation.

Rackham 
student 
Pete 

Haviland-Eduah, 
vice 

president of Students of Color 
of Rackham, said though he is 
in favor of the relocation, he 
has reservations about how 
the project will be executed. 

“We’ll also see how the 

new space works functionally. 
I would hate to see it be a 
space that’s not necessarily 
as functional for what it was 
meant to serve,” Haviland-
Eduah said. “With any type 
of move, there’s always room 
for negative impact to happen, 
and I hope that’s minimized if 
it exists at all.”

In recent months, other 

students have voiced concerns 
over the relocation of Trotter 
as well. During a September 
forum at Trotter, Rackham 
student 
Asya 
Harrison, 

secretary of Students of Color 
of Rackham, told E. Royster 
Harper, 
the 
University’s 

vice president for student 
life, 
that 
moving 
the 

center to Central Campus 
would threaten its quiet 

atmosphere and separation 
from the stresses of classes 
and schoolwork.

At the meeting, LSA senior 

Bree 
Sullivan 
expressed 

unease regarding the move 
as 
well, 
highlighting 
the 

history and importance of the 
current building. She noted 
that the facility has served as 
a home for underrepresented 
minorities, and she worried 
that the space may not feel as 
safe on Central Campus.

“This is a lot of history, this 

building,” she said. “I want it 
and I want future generations 
to have it.”

Former 
BSU 
Treasurer 

Robert Greenfield said he 
hopes the new center will have 
designated spaces for Black 
students on campus as well as 
students of other identities.

“I really hope they don’t 

minimize the identities of 
other cultures,” Greenfield 
said.

He added that he hopes 

the new multicultural center 
will be named after someone 
who is representative of the 
ongoing 
campus 
struggle 

to 
improve 
diversity 
and 

inclusion.

“Already 
on 
campus, 

we have a lot of buildings 
that are named after a lot 
of 
people 
who, 
although 

their accomplishments with 
regards 
to 
the 
University 

were great, were very racist 
people,” he said. “I don’t want 
it to be named after a past 
president of the University 
from the late 1800s. I want it 
to be named after someone 
that’s representative of this 
newfound 
struggle 
that 

minority students have on 
campus.”

Regardless of the mixed 

feelings 
surrounding 
the 

move, for some, the relocation 
of 
Trotter 
signifies 
the 

beginning of a new chapter 
at the University that will 
affect 
future 
Wolverines.

Kendall, BSU speaker, said 
she was pleased with the 
relocation of Trotter despite 
the fact that she will not be 
able to take advantage of the 
new center herself.

“Though I won’t be here to 

experience it, I am comforted 
with the notion that countless 
numbers of my peers and 
I 
have 
done 
something 

that I hope will change the 
experience of generations to 
come,” Kendall said.

from 
the 
U.S. 
Attorney’s 

Office that it, in joint with 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency, will investigate the 
crisis.

The crisis began after the 

city of Flint switched from 
Detroit city water to using the 
Flint River as their primary 
water 
source. 
Following 

the switch in April 2014, 
residents began to notice a 
change in the water’s quality 
as well as adverse health 
affects like hair loss and 
rotted teeth. Testing later 
revealed an unsafe amount 
of lead and trihalomethanes 
— a carcinogenic chlorine 
byproduct — in the water.

The Flint Water Advisory 

Task Force was assigned to 
investigate the mishaps in 
Flint’s handling of their water 
in 
October 
2015. 
Wyant’s 

resignation, as well as other 
state efforts, are in response 
to the task force’s findings.

“The health and welfare of 

Flint residents is a top priority 
and we’re committed to a 
coordinated approach with 
resources from state agencies 
to address all aspects of this 
situation,” Snyder said in a 
press release on January 5. 
“Working in full partnership 
with the Flint Water Advisory 
Task Force, all levels of 
government and water quality 
experts, we will find both 
short-term 
and 
long-term 

solutions to ensure the health 
and safety of Flint residents.”

In a statement, Attorney 

General Bill Schuette said 
despite knowing Wyant to 
be a hard working public 
servant, he believed Wynat’s 

resignation was necessary to 
rebuilding the public’s trust 
in the state.

“In my 20-plus years of 

knowing him, Dan has been 
a 
hardworking, 
dedicated 

public servant,” Schuette said. 
“I am committed to working 
with all parties, including the 
legislature and Governor, to 
ensure the public’s health and 
the well being of Michigan 
residents.”

Though the city admitted 

to 
violating 
the 
federal 

Safe 
Water 
Drinking 
Act 

for the unsafe amount of 
trihalomethanes in January 
2015, 
Flint’s 
emergency 

manager chose to keep their 
current 
water 
filtration 

system for nine more months.

In October, the city struck 

a deal to begin purchasing 
water from Detroit again, 
amid investigation into Flint’s 
water quality concerns.

“When I became aware 

that the city of Flint’s water 
showed elevated lead levels... 
I appointed an independent 
task force to identify possible 
missteps 
and 
areas 
for 

improvement,” Snyder noted 
in a statement released in 
December.

The 
state 
government’s 

response to the crisis has 
drawn significant criticism, 
especially 
from 
interest 

groups 
in 
the 
state, 
as 

well 
as 
engagement 
from 

colleges in the area. Lonnie 
Scott, 
executive 
director 

of 
Progress 
Michigan, 
a 

political organization whose 
mission is to hold government 
officials 
accountable, 
said 

in a statement he believes 
Michigan officials have not 
taken responsibility for the 
crisis 
surrounding 
Flint’s 

water supply. 

“Dan Wyant gets to walk 

away from this crisis, but the 
people of Flint do not,” Scott 
saidW. “We need complete 
transparency so that justice 
for the families of Flint can be 
realized and the proper people 
can be held accountable. All 
documentation related to this 
crisis needs to be released to 
the public immediately.”

The crisis has also prompted 

University 
engagement. 

Faculty 
at 
UM-Flint 
will 

offer a special course on the 
water crisis and other local 
issues. Starting this semester, 
the class will feature panel 
discussions with leaders and 
experts in the field.

Suzanne 
Selig, 
director 

of the Department of Public 
Health and Health Sciences 
at 
UM-Flint, 
hopes 
this 

class will benefit the entire 
community, she said in a 
statement.

“We 
want 
to 
promote 

a 
further 
understanding 

of this crisis and discuss 
lessons learned as we move 
forward together to promote 
better health for all in our 
community,” 
Selig 
said. 

“The 
students 
will 
have 

an 
opportunity 
to 
‘see’ 

community engagement and 
how we can all benefit from 
an open dialogue.”

In a January release, Snyder 

said he hopes the actions 
being taken now will help 
to protect the health of Flint 
residents both in the short 
and long term.

“I want the Flint community 

to know how very sorry I 
am that this has happened,” 
Snyder said. “And I want all 
Michigan citizens to know 
that we will learn from this 
experience, because Flint is 
not the only city that has an 

to compete with accredited 
dancers.

“It was amazing to see the 

professionals 
showcased 
at 

Nationals and compete in the 
same field as some of the best in 
the country,” she said. “Ballroom 
has given me so many great 
memories I know I’ll take with 
me later on in life.”

Their 
performance 
was 

followed by a samba jive done to 
“Jailhouse Rock,” a combination 
piece, and finished with a cha-
cha from two alumni.

Wednesday’s 
event 
was 

the first free lesson of four 
more to come. The lessons 
are designed to demonstrate 
what membership in the team 
looks like, according to LSA 
sophomore Saharsh Hajela, the 
team’s public relations chair.

“We really think for people 

to get the ballroom experience 
individuals need to actually 
experience the dancing itself,” 
he said. “This is just a taste on 
how a lesson would work.”

He added that the team has 

a positive environment that 
doesn’t require any previous 
experience, 
which 
other 

members of the team also 
emphasized.

“Just be brave and go for it; 

you never know until you try,” 
Hajela said. “Most of our team 
has little to no experience. I 
would say that around 95 percent 
of the team, including those we 
showcased today, started with 
no prior experience. We have 
all different kinds of people 
on the team from all different 
backgrounds majors and career 
paths — no one fits a mold for 
Ballroom.”

with voters in order to gain their 
trust.

“I had to run a different 

campaign,” Ackerman said. “It 
was very grassroots. We knocked 
on 4,000 doors, and 2,000 of those 
were done by myself. I just had to 
introduce myself to the voters and 
prove to them this was something 
I have been passionate about for a 
long time and I will continue to be 
passionate about it.”

Ford School Prof. Rusty Hills 

, whose class — Elections and 
Campaigns — Ackerman took, 
said he advocates for students like 
Ackerman, who make political 
change. If there is one lesson Hills 
hopes students acquire from his 
classes, it’s that everyone can 
make a difference.

“One 
person 
can 
make 
a 

difference and that person can be 
a young person,” he said. “There’s 
no reason why a student at the 
University of Michigan can’t make 
a difference.”

Ackerman’s love for politics 

began as a high schooler in Ann 
Arbor. He said he was a nerdy 
15-year-old boy, and he channeled 
his nerdiness into government and 
politics. In high school, he first 
began attending the Ann Arbor 
City Council meetings and he said 
“it kind of stuck.” 

His education at Michigan, he 

said, allowed him to grow in his 
love and understanding of politics. 
An 
introductory 
course 
on 

comparative politics with Political 
Science Prof. Andrei Markovits 
was particularly influential for 
Ackerman. 
The 
comparative 

nature of the class allowed him to 
realize the value of government 
systems outside of Michigan.

“And while this isn’t directly 

applicable 
to 
municipal 

government and my work on 
student council, it did give me 
a frame that there are practices 
that exist in other communities 
and that we can’t always look 
internally,” Ackerman said.

Additionally, interning with a 

congressional race in Michigan for 
credit instead of taking a class also 
helped fuel Ackerman’s political 
education. 
The 
action 
based 

learning, he said, was as important 
to him as his formal education.

“If 
you 
want 
to 
make 

a 
difference 
in 
your 
local 

community, your state or nation, 
you really have to dive right into 
it,” he said. “I think the greatest 
educational experience I’ve had 
has been working on campaigns 
or for elected officials. This class 
gave me a good excuse to do this.”

Along 
with 
Ackerman, 

University alum Travis Gonyou, 
who graduated in 2012, said his 
University education allowed him 
to get a greater understanding of 
politics that he used for his current 

job as a community outreach and 
communications manager at the 
Regional Transit Authority of 
Southeast Michigan. Gonyou said 
Political Science Prof. Arthur 
Lupia’s political persuasion class 
was 
especially 
formative 
for 

Gonyou, and inspired him to think 
about politics in a different way.

“It really changed the way I 

thought about the field of politics 
and what I could actually do in 
the realm of politics,” he said. 
“The research he presented was 
really inspiring. He changed the 
trajectory that I went on and I 
have to say it was influential as a 
mentor and advisor to me.”

Gonyou said his experience 

during 
the 
undergraduate 

research opportunity program 
also allowed him to think beyond 
what he believed to be the basis of 
politics.

“It was then that I started to 

realize that it wasn’t just about the 
difference in theory and what you 
see in political practice or learning 
about 
the 
actual 
structures,” 

Gonyou said. “But rather how our 
words and hand gestures portray 
a certain meaning within political 
debate.”

Gonyou said his Michigan 

education not only gave him 
career opportunities, but also 
helped him reach an extensive 
alumni network — especially since 
connections can have an influence 
on politics.

“It is incredible having an 

alumni network that is one of 
the largest in the world and of 
politically-minded and incredibly 
intelligent people who all are 
looking out for you,” he said. “I 
think that is a huge influence on 
the political world.”

Law Prof. Michael Barr also 

noted that the education at 
the University aids students in 
internships and post-grad life.

“One of my students from last 

year, Kate Fitzgerald, is currently 
an intern for the Clinton campaign 
in New York working on policy 
issues,” Burr said. “I think her 
strong analytic timing at Michigan 
has helped her be an effective 
writer and analysist and is helping 
her help the campaign.”

Hills said he has also seen 

numerous examples of his students 
succeeding in the political world, 
including former state Rep. Paul 
Scott, who chaired the House 
Education Committee during his 
term.

Overall, Ackerman said many 

details from his classes still 
resonate with him in his day-to-
day career.

“There are some sound bites 

I still remember from Professor 
Hills,” Ackerman said, “Like be 
bold, which means knowing what 
you want and be willing to fight for 
it when it’s the right time. Also you 
can do as many things as you want, 
but you can only do one thing well. 
Which is an important perspective 
for a political leader.

A

fter about 20 minutes of unceasing 
pestering — the kind 9-year-old little 
sisters possess an innate talent for 

— 
my 
then-18-year-old 

brother finally agreed to 
go for a bike ride with me 
on some trails near our 
house. 
Throughout 
the 

ride, I fumbled about on 
the narrow dirt trails, 
bumping into my brother’s 
bike, alternating between 
falling too far behind and 
pedaling too far ahead. 
I was at a very talkative 
point in my childhood, and 
with every bump or wrong 
turn of my handlebars, I merely apologized 
and continued gabbing.

Though I was very talkative, my brother had 

become aware of another pattern of behavior 
I’d recently picked up. He suddenly braked in 
the middle of the trail, turned his bike around 
to look at me and, with a perturbed tone in his 
voice, asked me why I kept saying “sorry” so 
often. Apparently, I’d been doing that awhile, 
and even when I wasn’t causing collisions, I 
had begun almost every sentence since we’d 
left the house that afternoon with the word 
“sorry.” I didn’t know how to respond, nor 
did I have an explanation for the frequency 
of my apologies, so I replied with what was 
probably the last thing my brother wanted 
to hear — yet another apology. He shook his 
head and, in a true broth-
erly fashion, curtly told 
me I should stop because 
I was being annoying. As 
he began to slowly pedal 
onward, he amended that 
statement by adding the 
warning that people may 
not take me seriously if I 
was always apologizing.

The memory of that 

conversation 
with 
my 

brother still resurfaces 
from time to time, espe-
cially when my apologies 
seem too numerous and 
unnecessary. In fact, that 
conversation was in the 
back of my mind during 
Winter Break when I had the opportunity to 
catch up with a mentor and some colleagues 
from a project I worked on a couple of years 
ago. As our mentor gave us all advice about our 
individual work and our creative pursuits, she 
stressed the importance of language — how 
our words carry a specific magnitude into the 
world. But one of the most influential pieces of 
advice I took away from meeting with her was 
that what we communicate about ourselves 
through our words and our actions is one way 
we can decide how we’ll be perceived.

After she said that, I sat there recalling 

moments when I didn’t display confidence in 
myself or in the work I was producing. While 
I took my older brother’s advice all those 
years ago, I still catch myself apologizing in 
situations where an apology is unnecessary 
and second-guessing myself in discussions. I 
thought of all the times I asked questions by 
first saying, “So, this is a stupid question but … 
” I remembered moments when I would apolo-
gize for asking a question or saying something 
I didn’t think furthered the conversation.

But in these thoughts, I know I’m not alone.
Women, researchers and journalists alike, 

noticed this general and gendered pattern of 

over-apologizing years ago. In fact, a 2010 
study found that women apologize more 
often than men on a consistent basis, and that 
this is because women are often more likely 
to perceive themselves committing social 
offences or transgressions. As a result, we 
apologize, offering up acquiescence in a soci-
ety where women are continually expected to 
be polite, to be unobtrusive, to be perpetually 
pleasant and to be unaggressive.

Since then, there has been a slew of com-

mentary in the media — from articles to 
comedy sketches — describing this societal 
pressure, which also plays a role in the fre-
quency of women apologizing. According to 
linguist Robin Lakoff, “sorry” is a method 
women can use to obtain some of the power 
usually denied to them while still conforming 
to contemporary norms. Lakoff states that 
apologizing “lets people — especially women 
— get away with saying what the other person 
doesn’t want to hear.” At the same, another 
linguist, Deborah Tannen suggests that the 
act of apologizing is often viewed negatively 
as a form of dismissal or defeat.

Awareness of this trend and its capabil-

ity to make women appear less competent 
and confident has even prompted the cre-
ation of a Chrome app called Just Not Sorry. 
This app highlights particular phrases in an 
e-mail that could come as across as language 
that would dismiss or undermine the profes-
sional abilities of the writer. The app’s cre-
ators at Cyrus Innovation, a consulting firm 

specializing in women-led 
companies and tech teams, 
created the app to alert 
women about the subcon-
scious word choices they 
may regularly use to avoid 
seeming too demanding.

As I wrote through a 

draft of this column, I 
realized there is already 
so much information on 
this topic. Oddly enough, I 
began to wonder if I should 
apologize 
for 
bringing 

up a subject people have 
discussed for years. This 
goes to show that after so 
much discussion, women 
still feel compelled to say 

“sorry” for things that don’t require an apol-
ogy, and many women may still feel anxiety 
about appearing too aggressive. When gender 
norms are so ingrained in our society, they 
can persist for a long time and contribute to 
trends of inequality. To counter this, we need 
to continue to facilitate awareness and dis-
cuss the causes of such trends. Whether it’s 
through apps, journalism, art or educating a 
variety of groups, this is clearly a conversa-
tion worth continuing.

Each time “sorry” is the initial phrase in a 

sentence, it usually masks a far more impor-
tant statement such as “I have an idea,” “I 
have a point to contribute” or “I have a ques-
tion.” These words introduce sentences that 
people need to hear and respect, regardless 
of gender or any other identity trait. “Sorry” 
may have a proper place in our general eti-
quette. However, no individual should ever 
feel so restricted by norms that they apolo-
gize for questioning the world around them, 
for having confidence or for wanting to 
express their ideas.

Sick of sorry

Not a nice neighborhood

W

e’ve all done it: riding 
around in a car, going 
down a street that has 

seen 
better 

days and saying 
something 
like, 

“This isn’t a nice 
neighborhood.”

I’ve 
been 
a 

passenger with my friends many 
times over the past year, and I’d 
estimate that I would have to use 
both hands to count how many 
times I’ve heard someone say a ver-
sion of this. It struck a chord with 
me, being from a city that people 
look down upon because of its name 
and the media’s portrayal of it rath-
er than because of an unpleasant 
visit. These comments don’t add 
anything to the drive.

It made me frustrated, mostly 

because what I heard came across 
as a blanket statement for all neigh-
borhoods that looked similarly 
“bad.” The majority of the places we 
passed looked perfectly fine — and 
familiar.

Everywhere we passed looked 

similar to my neighborhood in 
my city, Flint. If they thought my 
neighborhood was bad, what would 
they think of me? I’ve lived in and 
been to less-than-affluent neigh-
borhoods in Flint, Detroit, Philadel-
phia, Mississippi and other areas 
across the country.

Yes, the neighborhood doesn’t 

look great, but it isn’t bad. It isn’t 
“not nice.”

“This isn’t a nice neighborhood” 

can come across like “I’m used to 
better — we shouldn’t go in there 
because in there, crime is possible, 
and the people there are danger-
ous.” In reality, those statements 
might or might not be true. What’s 
really dangerous is making those 
assumptions before you meet some-

one who actually lives there.

There’s a difference between the 

action of not entering the neighbor-
hood and the reason behind it. It’s 
perfectly fine to stay away because 
you don’t feel safe in an area where 
you don’t know the people. It’s 
harmful to avoid driving on that 
street because you assume you’ll 
get robbed if you stop at a certain 
gas station, or feel certain you’ll get 
a dirty look if you make eye contact 
with a pedestrian. We all face this 
catch-22, myself included.

The high frequency of crime 

coverage in the media has given 
people the idea that bad things and 
only bad things happen in poorer-
looking areas. There’s no message 
of hope. There’s no story of people 
working together or of comradery 
between neighbors. The more nega-
tive viewpoint may be the more 
accurate, but the stories about areas 
like this never consider that the 
glass is half-full, not half-empty.

I realize, since I’m from a poor-

er-looking area, my perspective is 
different. I’m more accustomed to 
seeing areas like this, while others 
aren’t. I’ve had experiences in more 
run-down neighborhoods, and I 
came out of those places just fine. 
Through volunteer projects in plac-
es like Detroit, I’ve even left them in 
a better state than they were when 
I entered. I’ve seen my great-uncle’s 
garden (with many stalks of corn!) 
on Flint’s north side, and have met 
some of the sweetest people I’ve 
ever had the pleasure of knowing in 
Philly and Kokomo, Ind.

While others may not feel safe, 

I’m kind of reminded of home. I 
don’t live in the most crime-cen-
tered area in Flint by any means, 
but my neighborhood may look 
“bad” if someone from out of town 
visited. Like every neighborhood 

in the world, we are not immune to 
crime. I’ve been affected by crime 
personally, but it doesn’t affect my 
concept of this area as home to me.

On the other hand, people who 

live in especially crime-ridden and 
downtrodden areas may desper-
ately be trying to get out. They may 
want to leave, and may not feel like 
their house is their home because 
they feel uncomfortable and unsafe. 
Their lives could be at stake. But 
that gives them the strongest of 
grounds and credibility to talk 
about their neighborhood. They’ve 
lived there and have gone down 
the same street every day, possibly 
looking at another neighborhood 
and saying, “I’d like to live there.”

We’re 
all 
culprits 
of 
look-

ing down on a neighborhood just 
because of its appearance. We’ve 
all been quick to assume, quick to 
judge a book by its cover. On the 
outside, we can see an area that’s 
poor, struggling, dangerous. But 
the inside might reveal a commu-
nity living as a team, a group of 
people who have had tough breaks 
and are doing their best for a safe 
place to live.

The assumptions we make can 

sometimes be well-founded, but it’s 
also possible we have been misin-
formed. Until we’re completely cer-
tain our assumptions are true or we 
have lived in the area in question, 
we shouldn’t say, “That isn’t a nice 
neighborhood.”

In response to the next time I 

hear this, I hope to speak up and say 
that we can’t be sure.

You know what you should say 

when you come across a neighbor-
hood like this?

Nothing.

Playing in the mud

I

n late December 2015, Amanda 
Bouldin, 
New 
Hampshire 

state representative, posted a 

Facebook status 
that 
objected 

to a proposed 
state law that 
would make it 
a misdemeanor 
offense 
for 

a 
woman 
to 

expose 
her 

nipple in public.

Josh 
Moore, 

another 
New 

Hampshire state 
representative, 
commented that if Bouldin feels 
exposing the female nipple is natu-
ral, then she must also feel it is tol-
erable and natural for men to grab 
women’s nipples. She said nothing 
remotely related.

When anyone shares a politi-

cal opinion — whether on social 
media, through art or in a column 
like this one — they expose them-
selves to commentary and criticism 
from anyone who might disagree. 
Unfortunately, as courteous civil 
discourse quickly evaporates from 
the political sphere, policy advo-
cates increasingly find their words 
contorted far beyond their original 
meaning, and their character or 
intelligence attacked simply due to 
their opinion.

Google almost any issue, click on 

a random op-ed and read the com-
ment section. There’s a pretty solid 
chance someone’s called the writer 
an idiot, racist, socialist or worse. 
Or you could try looking up Hill-
ary Clinton, Donald Trump, Bernie 
Sanders or any of the other presi-
dential candidates. You’re sure to 
find at least one piece comparing 
him or her to Hitler, Stalin or a war 
criminal. The Twitter world has 
even taken a few swings at Ben Car-
son’s wife’s appearance.

Our collective inability to play 

nice and avoid hyperbolizing seri-
ous issues on the Internet no doubt 
threatens our ability to objectively 
evaluate candidates and high-stakes 
political issues. It also likely deters 
otherwise competent people who 
are passionate about serving our 
country from attempting to do so 
through political channels for fear of 
seeing their family’s name dragged 
through the mud. I’ve even heard a 
few of my peers in the Ford School 
of Public Policy remark that they’d 
be unwilling to publicly advocate on 

certain issues for fear of backlash.

U.S. political discourse has dete-

riorated into disparaging, meaning-
less mud tossing. But the issues that 
face our community and country — 
muddy or not — require our atten-
tion, thoughts and voices.

I have learned the hard way that 

contributing my voice to political 
issues requires me to subject myself 
to criticism and mud tossing. But 
the willingness to subject my work 
to potential criticism has made me 
a better writer and advocate for the 
issues I care about.

The summer after my freshman 

year, I wrote a Michigan Daily 
column titled “The Problem with 
Feminism.” It received dozens of 
comments — most of them negative 
and written by people who hated 
my piece.

Their words seethed with anger 

and disgust with my writing. To 
this day, I remember word for word 
some of the many comments about 
how awful or stupid I was, not 

only as a writer, but also as a per-
son. When I first read all the com-
ments, the sense of pride I once felt 
in my work quickly dissipated. I felt 
dejected and defeated, and definite-
ly cried.

At the time, I might have 

described myself as offended by 
the mean comments. On a surface 
level, I was. But the real disappoint-
ment arose out of the dissonance 
between the commenters’ and my 
own perception of my work. Origi-
nally, I had agreed with my own 
opinion and had thought the col-
umn was a good one. 

But after reading so many nega-

tive reactions to my work, I began 
to adopt the overly negative view of 
the commenters. I started to believe 
I was as stupid as so many of them 
suggested, and began referring 
to the piece as “the worst column 
ever.” I told my editors I wasn’t 
going to write a column ever again.

But as I processed the event over 

the next couple of days, I began 
to read my own writing through a 
new lens. I came to understand that 
neither the commenters nor I had 
adequately evaluated the piece. It 
wasn’t “the worst column ever,” but 
it did have objective flaws. Some 
of my word choice wasn’t precise 
enough to accurately represent my 
opinion. There were holes in my 
argument that I didn’t notice when 
I proofread it the first time. Some of 
the sentence structure was off.

This realization quickly became 

motivating. I knew where my work 
needed to improve. I reversed my 
decision never to write columns 
ever again less than a week after 
I had made it. For better or worse, 
I’ve been sharing my opinions with 
Daily readers ever since.

Last 
semester 
during 
finals 

week, a Michigan Review writer 
published a reply to a column I had 
written on gun control. The piece 
took quotes from my “insane” col-
umn out of context before tearing 
them to shreds.

But truth be told, the reply 

piece didn’t really bother me. I 
had already come to accept — even 
welcome — the opportunity to read 
dissent from my work. I had gained 
something invaluable from my first 
experience with critics: the abili-
ties to more objectively evaluate my 
work and process criticism as sug-
gestions for improvements instead 
of personal attacks.

As a columnist, I have developed 

a more durable self-confidence 
grounded in appreciation of my 
abilities, and an acceptance of my 
weaknesses and capacity for error. 
I have become more willing to take 
risks, accepting of the possibility 
that I might fail.

To anyone who cares about our 

world and the people in it, don’t be 
afraid to share your opinions with 
those who might disagree. Read-
ing negative feedback and personal 
attacks against you, and seeing 
your words taken out of context is 
hardly fun. But it’s certainly worth 
it. Our country needs thoughtful, 
passionate people willing to share 
their views. Accepting the risks of 
advocating and discussing difficult, 
divisive issues certainly represents 
an opportunity not only to help 
make our country a better place, 
but for personal growth as well.

Michigan’s quiet superstar

Freshman Connor 
responds to World 
Juniors snub, earns 
GLI MVP honors

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

Through the smears on fogged 

glass, it is possible to just make 
out the Michigan hockey team’s 
star freshman forward crouched 
low in net.

Fishing out pucks after a 

grueling midweek practice, Kyle 
Connor is the last player to leave 
the ice. Connor doesn’t seem to 
mind; he’s only worried it might 
make him late to conditioning.

But that’s the 18-year-old’s 

demeanor in a nutshell — the 
attention never mattered to him 
anyway.

December was Connor’s best 

month of his fledgling collegiate 
career. The 17th overall pick by 
the Winnipeg Jets in the 2015 
NHL Draft led the nation in 
college goals (seven) and points 
(13). He had two game-winning 

goals 
during 
the 
stretch, 

including a third-period tally on 
Dec. 29 that sent Michigan to the 
Great Lakes Invitational final.

The accolades came, too, as 

Connor earned GLI MVP honors 
and was named the Hockey 
Commissioners’ 
Association 

National Rookie of the Month for 
December.

But it was a snub, delivered 

by e-mail no less, that grabbed 
the 
headlines. 
When 
Team 

USA announced the roster for 
the 2015 IIHF World Juniors 
Tournament 
in 
Finland, 

Connor’s name wasn’t on the list. 
He hadn’t even been invited to 
the selection camp.

Connor, who has a career .81 

points per game with USA teams 
and starred in 2014’s U18 World 
Junior 
Championship, 
was 

shocked.

“Any time you don’t make 

a team — yeah, sure it hurts,” 
Connor said. “But you know, 
they 
did 
a 
good 
job 
over 

there. Congrats to (Michigan 
sophomore 
defender) 
Zach 

Werenski and the rest of the 
team.”

Team USA finished as bronze 

medalists.

Some think the tryout snub 

may date back to Connor’s USHL 
days 
with 
the 
Youngstown 

Phantoms. After a tremendous 
rookie year, Connor returned 
to Youngstown despite interest 
from 
the 
National 
Talent 

Development Program in Ann 
Arbor. In his sophomore season, 
Connor set a record for career 
points (74) with the Phantoms.

Sleights of this sort can be 

hard for Team USA to forgive.

“There is a loyalty towards 

players who have gone through 
the program in the past,” Dan 
Marr, chief scout for NHL 
Central 
Scouting, 
told 
The 

National Post. “It’s a little harder 
for someone who hasn’t been 
part of the process to break in.”

So was that chip on his 

shoulder the catalyst for another 
breakout performance at the 
GLI?

“I don’t think so, I just played 

my game,” Connor said.

Even Michigan coach Red 

Berenson seems to be incredulous 
at his star’s unflappability.

“I was worried how he would 

take the weekend he had against 

Minnesota and put that on the ice 
after Christmas, but there was no 
question when he came back for 
practice,” Berenson said. “That 
was good, because I was worried 
he might start worrying about the 
World Juniors and everything. 
He maxed out his weekend.”

Connor 
always 
seems 
to 

be doing exactly what he is 
supposed to do. He brings it in 
practice, wants to be a better 
defender and always gives the 
credit to his teammates.

Asked about his favorite goal 

this season, the left-winger said 
he doesn’t have one, offering 
only, “When you score, they 
don’t ask you how.”

The 
routine 
borders 
on 

monotony.

But the strategy is paying 

dividends. Opposing teams can’t 
ignore the freshman when he is 
scoring at this clip, and Connor 
is quickly becoming the most 
dangerous offensive weapon in 
Michigan’s deep arsenal.

He has found the most boring 

possible path to stardom, but 
that doesn’t seem to bother 
Connor at all — he never did 
care about the attention.

Freshman forward Kyle Connor didn’t earn a spot on Team USA’s roster for the World Junior Championships, but he kept up his stellar play nonetheless.

Michigan hosts 
Big Ten leaders

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is on a rough 
two-game skid to start the Big 
Ten season, and the schedule 
will only get 
tougher 
from 

here 
as 
the 

Wolverines 
(0-2 Big Ten, 
8-5 
overall) 

host Big Ten-
leading 
Iowa 

and No. 5 Ohio 
State for two 
out of the next 
three 
games. 

Thursday 
night, 
they 

will play the 
Hawkeyes (3-0 
Big Ten, 12-3 overall), looking to 
right the ship.

In its past three games, 

Michigan fell by two points 
or fewer to Eastern Michigan 
and Purdue, and suffered an 
overtime defeat to Indiana. Last 
year, aided by senior leadership, 
the Wolverines handled each of 
those teams with ease. Though 
the Big Ten season has just begun, 
it is evident that losing former 
seniors Cyesha Goree, Nicole 
Elmblad and Shannon Smith has 
created a tough transition period 
to begin the season.

This year’s Michigan team 

is certainly different than last 
year’s. 
The 
Wolverines 
are 

talented, 
and 
the 
freshman 

class of center Hallie Thome, 
guard Boogie Brozoski, guard 
Nicole Munger and forward Sam 
Trammel will bring Michigan 
success 
by 
the 
time 
their 

careers are over. But for now, 
inexperience has hurt this team, 
especially in the close losses. 
The clearest example is Thome, 
who has gotten into foul trouble 
early, unable to play late in games 
when the team needs her 6-foot-
5 frame for an inside presence on 
both offense and defense. 

“We started the season playing 

exceptionally well, and then we 
hit a little bit of a bump in the 
road,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico in an interview 
with WTKA. “For the most part, 
(we have) kids who have never 
been in that position before 
down the stretch of tough games. 
So they’re learning and their 
confidence is shaken a little bit, 
but it’s something we continue to 
work on in practice.”

Against Eastern Michigan, the 

Wolverines had a 12-point lead 
going into the fourth quarter. 
The Eagles kept pecking away at 
the lead, even though they were 
facing a more talented team. 
Talent didn’t beat effort, and 
Eastern Michigan clinched an 
upset win on its home floor.

In the last home game against 

Purdue, 
the 
Boilermakers 

scored the go-ahead basket in 
the waning seconds. When it 
was Michigan’s turn to step 
up, it wasn’t accustomed to the 
pressure. The Wolverines took 
the ball up the court, passed 
off for a worse shot and missed. 
After a foul, Brozoski — who is 
shooting 75 percent from the 
charity stripe this season — had 

an opportunity to tie the game 
by making three straight free 
throws, but missed the first.

Against 
Indiana, 
the 

Wolverines surged in the fourth 
quarter to cushion a lead going 
into the final minutes. The 
Hoosiers then went on a 12-3 
run to end the quarter, forcing 
the game into overtime, when 
Michigan eventually lost again.

Iowa lies just outside the 

top 25, but was ranked 23rd at 
the beginning of the season. 
The Hawkeyes also lost three 
seniors — the highest-scoring 
trio of all time in the Big Ten 
with 42.3 points per game — but 
are trending the opposite way 
as Michigan. Iowa is currently 
on a four-game winning streak, 
including kicking off Big Ten play 
2-0. Led by guard Ally Disterhoft, 
who is averaging 17.1 points, the 
Hawkeyes boast three players 
who average double figures.

In the two conference games 

Michigan has played thus far, 
it has allowed an average of 71 
points, while scoring an average 
of 66. Iowa has done nearly 
the reverse, on average scoring 
71.5 points and allowing 66.5. 
It would not be a surprise if the 
trend continued, especially since 
Iowa already has a challenging 
road win on its resume, in 
Lincoln on New Year’s Eve 
against Nebraska.

With the toughest games 

ahead of the Wolverines, a win 
against the Hawkeyes could 
change 
the 
momentum 
of 

their whole season. Iowa is the 
better team on paper, but the 
Wolverines are not guaranteed 
a loss. If the contest is close in 
its last minutes, Michigan will 
face another situation in which 
the game is down to the wire, 
needing not just one player on the 
floor to step up, but all five.

“The last couple weeks we 

watched a lot of film on areas 
where we need to improve 
and things we’re not doing 
exceptionally well,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We’re going to really watch 
some things and some times 
where we played exceptionally 
well. We had a 30-point win 
over Pittsburgh, a team that is 
doing pretty well right now, and 
(against) Xavier, a team that 
has only two losses, we had a 
30-point win.”

At the moment, Michigan 

does not look like a Big Ten 
contender. It is near the bottom 
of the standings and has lost 
three 
straight 
games 
that 

should have ended differently. 
If the Wolverines had closed 
out those games with a win, 
they would have just two hard-
fought losses to Princeton and 
No. 15 UCLA.

But instead, they started off 

with three Big Ten losses, and 
face another difficult obstacle in 
Iowa. Michigan is aware of its 
challenge ahead, though.

“I was coming over to Pizza 

House for the radio show, leaving 
the office at 6:45 (p.m.), and I had 
three freshmen walking into the 
gym to get some extra shots up,” 
Barnes Arico said. “It’s a great 
thing to see that they haven’t lost 
their determination and they’re 
still fighting.”

It’s (not) about Jake Rudock

Fifth-year senior 
ends college career 
with strong season 

at Michigan

By MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editor

Wearing 
a 
Citrus 
Bowl 

Champions T-shirt and a wide 
smile, Jake Rudock stepped onto 
the stage and, for once, there was 
nowhere to deflect the attention.

With an MVP performance 

in the Citrus Bowl, Rudock 
had just secured one of the 
greatest 
statistical 
seasons 

by a quarterback in Michigan 
history, 
finishing 
with 
the 

second-most yards, completions 
and completion percentage in a 
single season.

The only Wolverine on the 

stage at that time, Rudock 
walked along the front of it, 
high-fiving teammates who took 
delight in the moment.

Then, 
Rudock 
noticed 

someone standing on the field 
near stage left. Redshirt junior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson, who 
had left the Wolverines 41-7 win 
over Florida with an apparent 
leg injury, was 
back 
on 
the 

field.

Rudock, 

who will likely 
someday 
be 

either a doctor 
or 
an 
NFL 

quarterback, 
paused to ask 
Chesson if he 
was OK.

Two days before the game, 

Rudock’s father, Bob, could have 
explained the moment before 
it happened. Rudock’s personal 
mantra, his father said, is “It’s 
not about me.”

This was a game, mind you, that 

Rudock had owned. He threw for 
278 yards and three touchdowns, 
wrapping up a season that put 
him in contention to make an 
NFL roster in the summer.

Rudock routinely makes sure 

it’s not about himself, but this 
moment, on the stage at the Citrus 
Bowl, was entirely his own.

So how did it feel for him to be 

there alone on the stage?

“Oh, it was fun,” Rudock said.
And 
then 
he 
gave 
his 

teammates the glory anyway.

“The guys were loving it, they 

know how I am. I’d rather have 
the five big linemen up there — 
they’re the reason we were able 
to do everything we were able to 
do. But yeah, it was awesome. I’m 
just really happy for our guys.”

* * *

Before the Citrus Bowl or the 

records, and before Jake Rudock 
even thought about the University 
of Michigan, he had a chance to 
play professional baseball.

The son of a baseball coach, 

Rudock had been around the 
game from a young age — one 
or two years old, by his father’s 
estimation. The idea was that the 
more Jake was around the game, 
the more he would learn to love 
baseball and sports in general.

He played throughout his 

childhood, and when he arrived 
at St. Thomas Aquinas High 
School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
— where his dad was coaching 
— he joined a roster filled with 
talented athletes.

In Jake’s junior year, he hit 

cleanup in a batting order that 
featured 
James 
White, 
now 

a running back for the New 
England Patriots, and Giovanni 
Bernard, now of the Cincinnati 
Bengals, who hit first and second, 
respectively, in some games.

Bernard and White are now 

veterans of the NFL, a level 
Rudock may someday attain if 
he can impress scouts in the 
coming months.

But it won’t be the first time the 

quarterback has faced the scouting 
process for professional sports.

By the end of his senior year 

of high school, even though Jake 
had committed to play football 
at Iowa, Bob Rudock was getting 
phone calls about his son’s 
baseball future.

“When the draft was coming 

up, I had a number of calls from 
some (Major League Baseball) 
teams seeing if he was really 
going to go to Iowa,” Bob Rudock 
said. “Because they were going 
to draft him — not early, but they 
were going to draft him late (or 
sign him as a free agent).”

If Rudock thought he would 

have been a high-round pick, he 
might have taken a shot at the 
MLB Draft. But as things stood, 
he had another love developing 

with football.

He went to 

Iowa and had 
a 
successful 

career by most 
standards. 
Rudock started 
for two seasons 
as a Hawkeye, 
compiling 
an 

impressive 

touchdown-interception 
ratio, 

but he earned a reputation as a 
game manager.

For a quarterback, the term 

“game manager” can sometimes 
have 
an 
underwhelming 

connotation. Broadly speaking, 
it means he wouldn’t hurt the 
team, but he wouldn’t be the 
difference in many games, either. 
After two years of Rudock under 
center, the Hawkeyes handed 
the reigns of their offense to 
C.J. Beathard. Rudock’s days at 
Iowa were numbered, and he had 
to do what was best for him, so 
he sought a fresh start in Ann 
Arbor. The “game manager” 
label followed him.

Rudock, though, never seemed 

bothered by it. He wanted to 
help the team win games, and 
whatever that meant for his role 
was fine by him.

By the end of summer camp, 

he was the Wolverines’ starting 
quarterback. He won the job, and 
then he started winning games. 
Late in the season, he found 
a rhythm on deep passes, and 
that’s when he started breaking 
records. Ironically, his season 
seemed to pivot after he was 
knocked out of a game against 
Minnesota. In the aftermath 
of Michigan’s goal-line stand 
victory over the Golden Gophers, 
Rudock’s arm and resilience 
began to come into focus.

He absorbed hits at the end 

of runs and still never seemed 
scared to take off the next time. 
For being a “safe” option, Rudock 
was showing a curious amount of 
toughness. And Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh wasn’t shy about 
weighing in.

“In terms of respect and 

appreciation, he left a deep, 
indelible warmth in our heart for 
him,” Harbaugh said of Rudock 
on Nov. 23, before the Ohio State 

game. “He is so tough. This 
past game (against Penn State), 
I mean, the toughness was on 
display. I know I’ve said it, and 
maybe saying tough as a two-
dollar steak doesn’t even give it 
real justice. This guy is tough as 
nails, hard as hen’s teeth. He’s 
been a godsend for our team.”

But where did it come from? 

How did Jake Rudock become hard 
as hen’s teeth or tough as nails?

That gave Harbaugh pause.
“Hmm. 
That’s 
a 
great 

question,” he said. “I don’t think 
it’s — it’s a talent. I’ve always 
looked at toughness as a talent, 
that it’s trained. It’s not just 
granted upon somebody.

“He’s been trained well.”

Asked 
how 
Jake 
Rudock 

became 
Jake 
Rudock, 
Ken 

Mastrole has little hesitation.

Mastrole, a former quarterback 

at Maryland who had stints 
in the AFL and NFL Europe, 
started as Rudock’s quarterback 
coach his sophomore year of 
high school. And in their time 
together, Mastrole has noticed 
that his pupil has benefitted from 
a strong support system.

“Bob’s always had him around 

just good people,” Mastrole said 
on the phone last Thursday, 
the day before the Citrus Bowl. 
“Everything that Harbaugh said 
about him, the two-dollar steak 
comments and stuff, are totally 
dead-on accurate of his kind of 
personality and demeanor.”

Jake 
Rudock 
learned 
his 

first three-step drop from Dave 
Shula, the former head coach 
of the Cincinnati Bengals and 
the son of legendary coach Don 
Shula. Shula and the Rudocks are 
friends, which meant Rudock got 
to learn the most basic skill of 
quarterbacking from Shula in one 
of the two families’ living rooms.

That was the beginning of 

football for Rudock.

“He made (the local) All-

Star team (in middle school) 
and won the MVP as the safety, 
and the next year he switched 
to quarterback and he won the 
MVP as the quarterback in 
the local All-Star (event),” Bob 
Rudock said.

But by the time he got to high 

school — when then-St. Thomas 

Aquinas coach George Smith 
saw him — quarterback was the 
position that stuck.

That could have led to an 

inflated ego for a kid who had 
only been playing football for 
a short time. But those close to 
Rudock say it’s just not in his 
nature to let the cart get ahead of 
the horse.

Spend a few minutes on the 

phone with Bob Rudock, and it’s 
not hard to see why the refrains 
on Jake Rudock are about his 
selflessness and leadership. Just 
like his son, Bob is thoughtful. 
He thinks through questions 
before jumping right to an 
answer, and it seems to have 
rubbed off on his son.

“(Jake is) a guy that actually 

listens to his dad,” Mastrole said.

“His dad uses a great line all 

the time, it’s about two lines in 
life. … Basically, the one line has 
your parents, your girlfriend, 
your friends ... because they 
tell you what you want to hear. 
Jake’s got a couple guys in the 
other line that are the guys that 
are really going to hold him to a 
higher standard.

“A lot of kids don’t want to — 

they want to listen to the long 
line of people who tell you, ‘Hey, 
you’re great, you’re fantastic,’ 
and I get that. But I think people 
that are looking out for your best 
interest … you making the right 
decisions, using your time wisely, 
learning to control your emotions 
and 
being 
a 

good 
student 

and 
being 
a 

good 
leader, 

Jake’s 
really 

focused on that 
line.”

That 
line 

of 
people 

cultivated 
a 
leader 
in 

Rudock, which 
turned out to 
be crucial when playing at talent-
rich St. Thomas Aquinas.

Aquinas is the definition of a 

football powerhouse. The school 
has won six state titles since 
2007, and its alumni — including 
White, Bernard, Indianapolis 
Colts’ 
wide 
receiver 
Phillip 

Dorsett and others — litter NFL 
rosters.

According to Smith, Rudock 

has started more games than any 

quarterback in school history. 
And while he was there, Rudock 
and a teammate, Austin Barron, 
who now plays at Florida State, 
started a saying the school still 
uses: “You go, we go.”

“They would point around 

the room and point fingers at 
everybody and go, ‘You go,’ and 
then ‘You go,’ ‘You go,’ ‘You go,’ ” 
Smith said. “And when everybody 
is going, then, ‘We go.’ ”

As a football player, it’s hard to 

find a better place to play than St. 
Thomas Aquinas, where Smith’s 
program churned out top-flight 
college talent regularly. But in “You 
go, we go,” Rudock left something 
lasting at the program even among 
so many other star players.

After the school fell short of 

the state title his junior year, all 
Rudock did in his senior season 
was lead it to a 15-0 record 
as well as regional, state and 
national titles.

His final game, fittingly, was 

a state championship victory at 
the Citrus Bowl.

There’s a side to Jake Rudock 

that’s rarely seen by the media. 
In public, he’s loose, but he rarely 
lets on much about himself, 
preferring to deflect praise onto 
his teammates and coaches.

Even when it is about him, it 

isn’t about him.

And that’s where the curiosity 

with Rudock comes to a head. 
Rudock is unanimously referred 
to as a leader, mature and 
business-like, but few people 
seem able to articulate who 
Rudock is at heart — the reason 
he is the way he is in the huddle.

Asked this question over the 

phone Wednesday, two days 
before the Citrus Bowl, Bob 
Rudock put it better than just 
about anyone else could.

“Jake is very … how do I say 

this? He’s very unassuming,” 
Rudock said. “He does not 

like the limelight. … He’s very 
friendly. He’s funny — he will 
give you movie lines left and 
right if you let him get into it — 
but he does have the mentality 
where it’s his job to make sure 
everything gels.

“It’s 
about 
him 
getting 

everybody else better.”

That makes sense given his 

aspiration to go to medical 
school and someday, you know, 
make people better.

And in a football context, 

that’s exactly what he has done at 
Michigan. Twenty-one different 
Michigan players caught a pass 
this season, assuming you don’t 

count 
the 

pass 
Rudock 

completed 
to 

himself 
off 

a 
deflection 

against 
Michigan 
State.

He 
started 

slow, 
but 
as 

his chemistry 
with Chesson, 
Jake 
Butt 

and Amara Darboh developed, 
he ultimately turned in one of 
the best statistical seasons by a 
quarterback in school history. 
He threw for 3,017 yards and 
20 
touchdowns 
while 
also 

solidifying 
the 
second-best 

completion percentage in school 
history at 64 percent.

Still, no matter how much 

success he has, Rudock’s public 
image only recently began to 

shake the “boring” or “safe” label.

But redshirt junior running 

back Drake Johnson says that’s 
a product of the quarterback’s 
humor and personality being 
more subtle.

“He’s got a very sarcastic 

sense of humor,” Johnson said 
last Wednesday. “If you’re not 
keen to it, you’ll be (obliviously) 
like, ‘Oh, yeah, yeah.’ … He’s 
so smart that he can play with 
simple things.”

A 
couple 
nights 
earlier, 

Johnson, 
Rudock, 
Chesson 

and junior quarterback John 
O’Korn were at Buffalo Wild 
Wings having dinner. They 
were having a fairly normal 
conversation 
when 
Johnson 

picked up on one of Rudock’s 
jokes below the surface.

Johnson didn’t recall the joke, 

but he did remember his reaction.

“It hits you a minute late,” 

Johnson said. “I was like, ‘Wait, 
Jake…’ and he just gave me the 
wink. Once I see the wink, I’m 
just like, ‘Damn, he got me.’ ”

By most accounts, Rudock has 

a good sense of humor, even if it 
takes a bit of time to understand it.

If left entirely to his own 

devices, 
with 
no 
schedule, 

Rudock’s dad said he would 
think Jake would prefer to just 
watch a movie with friends or 
family. But it’s hard for him to 
say for sure.

“Gosh, as long as I can 

remember 
there’s 
been 
a 

schedule,” Bob Rudock said. 
“And you’ve gotta keep the 
schedule. You get your classwork 
done, you get your football done, 
you get your baseball done, you 
get your lifting in. There has not 
been a whole lot of free time.”

* * *

The coming months will put 

all of Rudock’s gifts — on the field 
and off it — to the ultimate test. 
In the next year, he will either 
be trying out for NFL rosters 

or applying to medical school, 
a slightly ironic dichotomy he 
seems destined to fulfill both 
sides of eventually.

He’s 
considering 
attending 

scouting camps, plus Michigan’s 
pro day and, if all goes well, 
possibly the NFL combine.

For Rudock, being drafted 

to the NFL is not out of reach. 
Otherwise, there’s a damned 
good chance he becomes a doctor 
— not a bad fallback plan.

In any case, Rudock will be 

doing what he’s always done 
best: making other people better.

“You 
hear 
the 
Bo 

Schembechler, ‘The team, the 
team, the team,’ ” Bob Rudock 
said. “Well, Jake was living that 
as long as I remember.”

In the waning moments of his 

Michigan career, after Rudock 
had answered his last postgame 
interview question, a Michigan 
spokesman approached him with 
a visitor. Jack Harbaugh, Jim’s 
toddler son, wanted a picture 
with Jake.

“Mighty 
Jack 
the 

Quarterback,” 
as 
Harbaugh 

called his son at his introductory 
press conference last December, 
had stolen Rudock’s hat, as they 
posed for a picture.

Rudock, after the last game 

of his college career, told him to 
keep it.

“It 
looks 
better 
on 
you 

anyway,” he said.

Simply put, “Jane the Virgin” has it all. It’s the most compulsively watchable show of the 

year, with deftly executed plot twists and breakneck pacing. In the style of Mexican tele-
novelas, there are juicy secrets, lies and betrayal. Where the typical show would wait until 
a season finale to reveal the truth, “Jane the Virgin” plays its cards early and efficiently, 
cutting out needless wheel-spinning. One of the most refreshing aspects of the show is the 
characters’ willingness to admit their feelings and work through their conflicts maturely. 
It’s refreshing, too, to see such an expertly balanced love triangle, with co-stars Michael 
(Brett Dier, “Ravenswood”) and Rafael (Justin Baldoni, “Everwood”) equally appealing in 
both Jane’s (Gina Rodriguez, “The Bold and Beautiful”) and the audience’s eyes.

The greatest strength of “Jane the Virgin” is its ability to marry its strong sense of humor 

with genuine sweetness and emotion. Practically every episode is a tearjerker, but practi-
cally every episode has at least a few guaranteed laughs. Whether you judge the show as a 
comedy or a drama, 2015 saw “Jane the Virgin” at the top of its field.

Pixar’s animated movies are famously both kid-

friendly and parent-friendly, and this year’s “Inside 
Out” continues that pattern. By telling the story of 
young Riley (Kaitlyn Dias, “The Shifting”) through 
the personification of her emotions, the film perfectly 
grasps the delicate balance of the feelings that wage 
war in our minds. It’d be enough just to spread a mes-
sage of optimism, but “Inside Out” goes above and be-
yond by choosing to illustrate the importance of feeling 
sad and being open about one’s emotions. In addition, 
it’s hilarious and imaginative, crafting a complex inte-
rior world of memory orbs and islands representing 
Riley’s biggest passions. TV comedy stars Amy Poehler 
(“Parks & Recreation”) and Phyllis Smith (“The Office”) 
are perfect as Joy and Sadness, but who could forget 
Bing Bong (Richard Kind, “Red Oaks”), the year’s most 
heartbreaking tragic character? “Inside Out” shows 
that Pixar’s ability to create the funniest, most affect-
ing movies of the year won’t be ending anytime soon.

Kendrick Lamar’s attitude and musical style has significantly grown since the 

release of hit single “Swimming Pools (Drank)” that was mostly played at frat par-
ties with gross beer and nightclubs with strobe lights. It evolved into a mature plea 
of self-expression on his newest album, To Pimp a Butterfly, that throws away the 
glorification of fame and instead burns people with the ugly truths of racism and 
socio-economic class issues.

BET named Kendrick Lamar the “Lyricist of the Year”, as the album showcased his 

talent of creating poetry and intertwining it with music to create the masterpiece that 
is To Pimp A Butterfly. Songs like “Hood Politics,” “Institutionalized,” and “The Blacker 
the Berry” are perceptions about the experience of being Black today. Kendrick’s lyrics 
are raw and emotional — it’s impossible to not empathize or get pissed off with the rac-
ism that still exists creating an ache for change in the world.

He sets these lyrics in front of music that has influences from multiple decades and 

genres to create this well rounded diverse piece of artwork. The opening song “Wes-
ley’s Theory” sounds very Howard Johnson-esque with its funky vibe paired with some 
R&B components. There’s also heavy jazz influence that artists like Terrace Martin and 
Kamasi Washington contributed that make To Pimp A Butterfly even more eccentric.

To Pimp A Butterfly became one of the best pieces of art released in 2015 because 

each separate component melts into the other, creating this message that helps us grow 
inside of our own individual cocoon. Hopefully, we’ll all be able to emerge into the 
monarch that is Kendrick Lamar.

On October 13, Piper Kerman, author of memoir “Orange is the New Black: 

My Year in a Women’s Prison” spoke at Rackham Auditorium on the larger 
significance of her story in the context of prison reform. Kerman became 
famous in the past few years due to the overnight success of Jenji Kohan’s 
Netflix series “Orange is the New Black,” loosely based off Kerman’s memoir. 
As an affluent, college-educated white woman, Kerman is not representative 
of the demographics of people incarcerated in the United States, as the coun-
try’s prison system is one that disproportionately arrests and incarcerates 
people of color. Kerman spoke of the manner in which she was able to use 
this privilege to generate conversation about the severity of mass incarcera-
tion. She articulated the way that her own privilege put her at a relative ad-
vantage which highlighted the inequality within the justice system. She has 
been traveling to prisons across the U.S. to teach and raise awareness of the 
need for prison reform. Kerman discussed that within University communi-
ties, people are less likely to commit crimes and be incarcerated compared to 
areas where there are fewer educational and cultural resources available. She 
also touched on the fact that the criminal justice system relies heavily on vio-
lence and fails to address the untreated mental health issues that can cause 
individuals to commit crimes. As a person who has gained monumental suc-
cess, Kerman spoke to show her commitment to raising overall awareness of 
the deep-rooted injustices of the prison system. Furthering the dialogue “Or-
ange is the New Black” has opened through popular culture, she spotlights a 
community that is systematically silenced.

Best Student Productions of 2015

1. Spring Awakening

Standing out among the 

student productions of 2015, 
“Spring Awakening” presented 
edgy and bold material that 
left the audience dazzled, if 
not slightly unsettled. Brought 
to 
campus 
by 
MUSKET, 

Michigan’s oldest student run 
theater group, this pop rock 
opera enthralled its audience 
with shouts of adolescent rage 
and passion as it followed 
German 
school 
children 

through their struggles with 
sexuality and independence. 
The musical ebbed and flowed 
with the music as characters 
broke out of their scenes in 
moments of climactic emotion 
to 
relay 
their 
unbearable 

state of mind to the audience. 
Presenting songs that ranged 
from 
heartfelt 
ballads 
like 

“The Dark I Know Well” to 
fits of anger like “The Bitch of 
Living,” the music alternately 

tugged 
at 
the 
audience’s 

heartstrings and inspired them 
to jump out of their seats and 
join the cacophony on stage. 
Meticulously 
choreographed 

and 
designed, 
MUSKET 

once again graced us with an 
adaptation of a Tony Award 
winning musical that broke 
every boundary, changed the 
meaning of taboo and left 
nothing to the imagination. 
Months 
of 
preparation 

and 
production 
member’s 

dedication made this musical 
a standout production of 2015, 
and 
of 
MUSKET’s 
lengthy 

repertoire. 
Sensuality 
and 

anger 
melded 
together 
to 

create a musical that made 
problems faced by children in 
19th century Germany relevant 
to modern college students, 
and that is an achievement of 
epic proportions.

3. Henry IV

SMTD’s 
MainStage 
pro-

duction of “Henry IV Part 1” 
showcased the depth of tal-
ent that SMTD students offer, 
while 
providing 
audiences 

with a captivating perfor-
mance of one of Shakespeare’s 
most well-known plays root-
ed in history. This play tells 
the story of King Henry IV, a 
king fearful for the fate of his 
kingdom once he steps down 
from the throne, given that his 
son Hal is next in line and is 
driven more by free spirit and 
youth than the constitution 
of a prince. Lord Northum-
berland and Hotspur threaten 
King Henry’s throne believ-
ing the king to be a usurper of 
it, and plot to overthrow the 
royal family. The SMTD cast 
was lively, demonstrating a 
clear grasp of the difficulty of 
Shakespeare’s language and 
the vocal complexity of the 

text, which required accents 
for multiple characters. Char-
acters Falstaff and Hotspur 
gave particularly captivating 
performances, as they added a 
layer of humor that was well-
received 
and 
appreciated. 

Directed by Performing Arts 
Prof. Rob Najarian, the com-
bat scenes were well-staged 
and executed and displayed 
the hard work and rigorous 
effort put in by cast members. 
The production took place 
in the Power Center, with a 
respectable audience turnout, 
many of whom were frequent 
Shakespeare-goers. For a play 
like “Henry IV Part 1,” which 
is a challenge for modern audi-
ences to follow, SMTD did not 
fail to deliver a performance 
of both understanding and est
eem.

Best Films of 2015

Plot-driven and emotionally 

powerful, “Marvel’s Jessica 
Jones” makes us believe that 
superheroes are people too. 
Private 
investigator 
Jessica 

Jones (Krysten Ritter, “Don’t 
Trust the B in Apartment 23”) 
puts her superhuman strength 
aside as she struggles to move 
on from her past. The Netf-
lix show, based on the Brian 
Michael Bendis comic series, 
explores common dynamics 
of power and manipulation 
within the context of a super-
natural world. Among other 
outstanding accomplishments, 
the Marvel series captures 

the 
all-consuming 
psycho-

logical manipulation of sexual 
assault without ever showing 
the abuse on screen. Instead, 
the show focuses on develop-
ing complicated characters to 
drive the 13-episode arc for-
ward. Unapologetic, witty and 
inarguably 
flawed, 
Jessica 

brilliantly exhibits a raw vul-
nerability often lost in flashy 
dramas, and is able to tell a 
moving story while sporting a 
single pair of faded jeans and 
downing countless bottles of 
whiskey.

“Hello 
friend,” 
Elliot 

Alderson (Rami Malek, “Short 
Term 12”) says, introducing 
the viewer to the world of “Mr. 
Robot,” a haunting mirror of 
today. Unexpectedly hosted by 
USA Network, Sam Esmail’s 
(“Comet”) “Mr. Robot” draws 
from the crises and worries 
surrounding 
technology 

to 
explore 
loneliness 
and 

uncertainty in a time of constant 
connection and information.

Anchoring the show with 

a 
powerhouse 
performance, 

Malek captures the disturbed 
figure of Elliot, a hacker that 
simultaneously knows so much 
and so little about himself 
and those surrounding him, 
including the enigmatic title 
character devilishly played by 
Christian 
Slater 
(“Breaking 

In”). Wracked by social anxiety, 
addiction and hallucinations, 
Elliot becomes the unreliable 
narrator of a series that begins 
as a techno-thriller and spirals 
into a dark, twisted odyssey of 
personal identity in modern 
times.

In an era where people project 

carefully constructed identities 
online and corporations wave 
an invisible hand of influence 
over every aspect of everyday 
life, “Mr. Robot” challenges 
viewers to look through the 
shadows of ambiguity, peel 
back the layers of deception and 
dig through all the bullshit that 
makes up society to reveal the 
insanity behind it all and ask 
the question: What is real?

2. “Mad Max: Fury Road”

Someday, there will be a 

wonderful documentary in the 
vein of “Hearts of Darkness” 
about the making of “Mad Max: 
Fury Road.” The film went to 
development hell and back — 
and emerged an iron-clad war 
machine, roaring its engines 
and screeching its tires through 
the cosmic roads of Valhalla. 
Here, the unparalleled star 
power of Tom Hardy (“The 
Dark Knight Rises”) and Char-
lize 
Theron 
(“Prometheus”) 

combines 
with 
impeccable 

cinematography 
and 
heavy 

reliance on practical action set-
pieces to form a rhythmic chase 
movie that’s simultaneously 
larger-than-life and painfully 
human. This is a tremendous 
action film that even manages 
to eschew the “guy movie” 
label with its refreshing inclu-
sivity. It’s amazing to see a new 
blockbuster that excels in both 
cinema art and crowd-pleasing 
so flawlessly. “Mad Max: Fury 
Road” is an achievement that 
anyone can enjoy. 

-JACOB RICH

No one had quite the breakout 

this year like comedian Aziz Ansari 
(“Parks and Recreation”). Any fan 
of Ansari’s standup knows that he 
loves to talk about modern issues, 
whether it’s the growing omnipres-
ence of technology or the underly-
ing insanity of monogamy. With 
his new 10-episode Netflix series 
“Master of None,” Ansari further 
infuses insight and depth within 
his topical humor by giving viewers 
a refreshing take on the coming-
of-age narrative. In an age where 
hyperconnectivity and ambition 

reign over the average millennial, 
Ansari captures the deep-seated 
anxiety and excitement that comes 
with life’s unpredictability. Not 
only is the show endlessly funny, 
beautifully filmed and well-acted, 
but “Master of None” also works 
on multiple levels. It charms as a 
witty romantic comedy, thrives as 
a thought-provoking commentary 
on race and gender and gives a poi-
gnant portrayal of a man uncertain 
of what he wants in life.

-SAM ROSENBERG

3. “Room”

For 9-year-old Jacob Trem-

blay, who plays 5-year-old Jack, 
this will be known as “the per-
formance that started it all.” As 
Jack and his 24-year-old mother, 
Ma (Brie Larson), physically and 
mentally transition from their 
kidnapped life in captivity in 
a tiny shed to “the real world,” 
emotions spin out of control both 
on screen and in the audience. 
Instead of distinct bursts of sad-
ness, anger, or happiness, it’s a 
powerful movie-long sensation of 
sadnessangerhappiness.

Watching a young boy experi-

ence his firsts (first friend, first 
bowl of ice cream, first haircut) 
while also seeing his mother 
struggle with PTSD makes us 
feel everything at once. Compos-
er Stephen Rennicks enhances 
these moments with a soundtrack 
that causes streams of crocodile 
tears just as a wide smile starts 
to spread. When the end cred-
its appear, this amalgamation 
of emotions subsides and one 
thought remains: our past is and 
always will be a part of us, but it 
doesn’t define us.

2. Tribe

What defines a person? The 

group they were born into or the 
group they identify with? How 
does this personal association 
influence a person’s interests? How 
does it affect the way they treat 
those they love? Rude Mechani-
cals, a student run theater group, 
posed these questions and more in 
their production of “Tribes” this 
past fall. Exploring the strained 
dynamic of an aggressive and 
overwhelmingly critical family of 
five, “Tribes” centers on the deaf 
Billy and his talkative and highly 
opinionated British family. The 
play expands on the silent world 
of the deaf when Billy is thrown 
into the path of Sylvia, a woman 
who grew up in a deaf family and 
is slowly growing deaf herself. 
Having lacked support and emo-
tional guidance in his bitterly sar-
castic family, Billy seeks support 
in Sylvia, and begins exploring 
the tribes he never before identi-

fied with. Distinguishing itself 
among the student productions of 
2015, “Tribes” consisted of a cast 
of six, all of whom worked to bal-
ance the family’s cries of anguish 
and anger with Billy’s silent, stoic 
demeanor. Tirelessly rehearsing to 
perfect their British accents, the 
cast worked with coaches simulta-
neously to accentuate their vowels 
and enunciate with their hands. 
The set introduced a version of 
closed captioning, allowing the 
characters to mime out the lines in 
American Sign Language and have 
the audience experience no loss 
of understanding. Rude Mechani-
cals’ dedication to their characters 
and production reflects a level of 
integrity that usually character-
izes plays that come and go in 
nationally renowned theaters, but 
instead is conveniently available 
right here on campus by passion-
ate students of all majors.

4. “Spotlight”

“Spotlight” is not a hero’s film. 

Portraying the journalists who 
uncovered the 2002 child abuse 
scandal in Boston’s Catholic dio-
cese, the film adopts its reporters’ 
restraint and illuminates the story 
rather than engaging in “prestige 
cinema” self-promotion. Stripped 
of stylistic frills and cheap sensa-
tionalization, no one escapes its 
critical eye. Both the victim and 
perpetrators’ lawyers navigate 
moral grey areas, and refresh-
ingly, the complexities of each 
party’s strategic decisions are not 
demonized, glorified, or glam-

ourized. The victim portrayals are 
also handled with care, appeal-
ing to audience empathy without 
exploiting personal experiences.

This unobtrusive cinematic 

philosophy lets “Spotlight” ask 
big-picture questions. How do 
institutional 
structures 
affect 

transparency? Are strategic sac-
rifices morally unacceptable or 
necessary? And most importantly, 
if people all over Boston turned a 
blind eye to this for years, what 
could you be missing?

-VANESSA WONG

5. “Brooklyn”

“Brooklyn” follows a woman 

faced with a series of tough alter-
natives. Eilis loves living at home 
in small-town Ireland with her 
mother and sister — but what if 
she left for America and forged an 
independent life? Eilis loves Tony 
— but what about all the other 
men out there, especially the ones 
she has more in common with? 
Eilis finds a spot of happiness in 
her rapidly-changing life— but 
what if homesickness and grief 
threaten to wreck it all? What’s a 
girl to do?

It speaks to “Brooklyn” ’s quali-

ty that viewers are so immediately 

invested in Eilis’s fate. You’re right 
there with her, weighing every 
option, feeling every stab of pain 
and smiling at every turn of fate. 
Saoirse Ronan provides Eilis with 
the subtle shades of a true master. 
Her nuanced performance is easi-
ly one of the best of the year. Eilis is 
a relatable everywoman, but she — 
and the film itself — doesn’t want 
for surprises. “Brooklyn” isn’t a 
thriller (thankfully, there aren’t 
any explosions or jewel heists), 
but the movie successfully ramps 
up the tension and delivers unex-
pected delight.

2. “Master of None”
3. “Marvel’s Jessica Jones”

4. “Mr. Robot”
5. “Fargo”

After a remarkable inaugural 

season, “Fargo” had to answer 
questions about whether lightning 
could strike twice. Much like “True 
Detective,” expectations were high 
for its sophomore effort. However, 
unlike the HBO limited series, 
“Fargo” was able to pull off a sec-
ond season that improved upon the 
first. The series told a story which 
had a higher degree of difficulty, 
featuring a full-on gang war among 
the Gerhardt crime family, which 
runs the Fargo and Kansas City 
crime syndicate. This intersected 
with the story of Ed Blumquist 
(Jesse Plemons, “Breaking Bad”) 
and his wife Peggy (Kirsten Dunst, 
“Spider-Man”), who accidentally 
run over the youngest Gerhardt son 
with her car. What’s truly remark-
able about this season is how it 
brings the disparate stories togeth-
er, and has everything click. The 
season builds the individual pieces 
into a whole that is as tense as it is 

quirky. There’s an extraordinary 
juxtaposition between the “Min-
nesota Nice” tone and the brutal 
violence of the gang war. It’s as hor-
ribly gruesome as it is hysterically 
funny. (Only “Fargo” could insert a 
UFO into a scene and have it actu-
ally make thematic sense.)

Meanwhile, the show’s cinema-

tography remained top-notch, as it 
again made good use of the snowy 
landscapes. An expanded ensemble 
features magnificent performances 
from Patrick Wilson (“The Con-
juring”), Jeffrey Donovan (“Burn 
Notice”) and Jean Smart (“Frasier), 
each of whom look like they’re hav-
ing a great time playing tough char-
acters. This year, “Fargo” showed 
that it could do something unex-
pected in its second season: bring 
even the most contrasting elements 
together into something better 
than its first.

6. “Phoenix”
7. “Creed”

A beautiful web of secrets 

and 
suspense, 
“Phoenix” 

takes a loud plot and quiets 
it, finding power in subtlety 
rather than overt drama. Nelly 
Lenz (Mina Hoss, “Barbara”), 
rendered unrecognizable in a 
concentration 
camp, 
returns 

to Berlin at the end of the 
war in search of her husband. 
She finds him at Phoenix, the 
location of her prewar gig as 
a nightclub singer. He doesn’t 
recognize her but offers a cut 
of her own inheritance if she 
agrees to impersonate herself. 
Why does she agree to it? We 

don’t know, for “Phoenix” itself 
is as secretive as its characters, 
keeping its audience on the edge 
of epiphany. Because it doesn’t 
get lost in its own plot, the film 
is able to become a powerful 
picture of the world in the 
aftermath of trauma, where 
victims and their tormentors 
walk 
the 
streets 
together. 

“Phoenix” is a mystery of 
identity, a drama of betrayal, 
and a beautiful testament to 
human survival capped by one 
of the strongest final scenes in 
recent history.

-MADELEINE GAUDIN

In a year filled with franchise 

reboots like “Mad Max” and 
“Star Wars,” “Creed” rises above 
them all. Taking the “Rocky” 
mythos and turning it on its 
head, director Ryan Coogler 
delivers an honest and often 
brutal picture about fathers and 
names. It’s a distinctly millenni-
al meditation — making a name 
in a world already dominated 
by those of our parents — that’s 
placed front and center in the 
unforgiving, vicious boxing ring. 
The struggle of our hero, Adonis 
Creed (Michael B. Jordan, “Fan-
tastic Four”), perfectly inter-

links with the struggle of his 
mentor, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester 
Stallone, “The Expendables”), a 
relic of a time long past, search-
ing for meaning in the modern 
day.

The result is a beautiful 

reflection of love, legacy and 
family, captured by some of the 
finest cinematography of the 
year (including a one-shot, two 
round fight scene), tense action, 
powerful performances and a 
marvelous score. “Creed” has 
the heart of a fighter, and the 
punch of a champion. 

-JAMIE BIRCOLL

6. “Orange is the New 

Black”

The 
highly 
anticipated 

third season of “Orange is the 
New Black” brought a new set 
of unexpected twists, backsto-
ries and comical and endear-
ing subplots that underpin 
the series by adding a unique 
flavor to the overarching plot. 
Like previous seasons, the 
precarious balance between 
comic relief and poignant 
storytelling succeeds in its 
eccentricity. Its supporting 
characters continue to come 
out of the woodwork through 
flashbacks, 
allowing 
their 

individuality and vulnerabil-
ity to shine. In the third sea-
son, the inhumane treatment 

of the inmates by Litchfield’s 
new 
business-minded 
cor-

porate managers renders the 
deputies powerless in making 
decisions that affect the day-
to-day lives of the women. 
However, the show illustrates 
how through small acts of 
defiance and creativity, the 
women take some of their 
power and individuality back. 
Netflix’s binge-worthy sea-
son has no lack of hilarious, 
uncomfortable 
and 
touch-

ing moments that continue to 
weave together an unconven-
tional and moving story.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Lyrically, the track is life-

affirming. For most, it was a 
groovy, easy beat that many 
matched with the windows-
down, 
warm-summer 
and 

smooth-drinks moments of their 
summer. Artistically, the track 
is exceptionally accomplished. 
What is more important than 
the catchiness and happiness of 
the track are the names attached 
to it: “I Know There’s Gonna Be 
(Good Times)” put Young Thug 
on popular radio. Jamie xx intro-
duced Young Thug, one of the 
most important rappers of this 
year and, surely, the upcom-
ing, to those who had not found 
him yet. Thug and his gloriously 
eccentric, outwardly clever, and 
quietly complex rasps were sam-
pled by the American public in 
this 2015 summer jam. We were 
given something a little more 
strong, a little more sonically 
pungent, to counter the sugary 
overload of the summer’s pop 
music circus. Jamie xx set the 
rap weirdo free on the track, bal-

ancing out his raspy words and 
screams with samples from The 
Persuasions’ 1972 single, “Good 
Times.” Popcaan, an up-and-
coming Jamaican dancehall art-
ist, added inventive twists and 
turns to the tracks. His added 
reggae undertones, pressed up 
against Thug’s melodic, strange 
screams, encourage that invol-
untary head and hip sway.

Jamie xx’s “I Know There’s 

Gonna Be (Good Times)” is a 
smooth balance of something 
tangy and something sugary. It’s 
the second-best banger of the 
year, and it’s actually good. And 
it actually introduced new, dar-
ing artists of the sometimes myo-
pic music industry. It mixed the 
mainstream, Billboard Top 100 
with that which is harder to find. 
Jamie xx is helping you be bet-
ter. He is helping you grow. And 
Young Thug is helping you get 
better. Because “you don’t got to 
struggle/ baby girl sit it down….”

Best Singles of 2015

Opening a TV season with a 

four-minute-long take of a wed-
ding portrait session is a bold 
move. For any other show, start-
ing with a static camera and 
bickering family might appear 
a desperate attempt to appear 
cinematic — clever filmmaking 
tricks have been enough to win 
movies Oscars and earn shows 
their fanboys for life. But Ama-
zon’s “Transparent” isn’t trying 
to show off. That opening shot 
is meant to reacquaint viewers 
with the Pfefferman clan and 
remind them just how uncom-
fortable it is to spend time with 
that family.

“Kina Hora,” “Transparent” 

’s second season premiere, is 
full of gorgeously framed shots 
and top-notch performances, 

but the episode never feels like 
it’s bragging. The swoops across 
hotel windows and claustro-
phobic tight shots augment the 
episode’s 
dramatic 
tension. 

Writer-director 
Jill 
Soloway 

(“United States of Tara”) pulls 
out all the stops to portray the 
horror show that is Sarah (Amy 
Landecker, “A Serious Man”) 
and Tammy’s (Melora Hardin, 
“The Office”) wedding — and 
imperfect wedding portraits are 
only the beginning. “Kina Hora” 
shatters the illusion of normalcy 
and happiness for almost every 
character, sending them spin-
ning on arcs that take them 
through to the end of the sea-
son. Family dysfunction never 
looked so good.

-CHLOE GILKE

3. (Tie) “Kina Hora” 

“Transparent”

“Parks and Rec,” like “30 

Rock” and “The Office,” sig-
nified the end of an era. For 
seven whole seasons, we grew 
along with Pawnee through 
marriages, children and town 
mergers.

What was most beautiful 

was watching Leslie Knope’s 
(Amy Poehler, “Saturday Night 
Live”) 
“pipeline 
dreams” 

become 
a 
tangible 
reality. 

Though we were left with a Lil’ 
Sebastian-shaped hole in our 
hearts, the series finale offered 
the perfect closure — even 
bringing back our beloved Ann 
Perkins (Rashida Jones, “The 
Office”). After the finale, we 
were left desperately YouTub-

ing gag reels, madly scrolling 
through Tumblr GIFs — any-
thing for a little more time 
with these characters. All we’d 
ever wanted was a happily ever 
after for each of them — and we 
got that.

For so many actors — Aziz 

Ansari and Nick Offerman, 
to name a few — “Parks and 
Rec” was their big break; for 
Leslie, Pawnee was her own 
big break toward her presiden-
tial dreams. But for both the 
fictional characters and their 
real-life actors, they will never 
be “too good” for Pawnee, even 
when they move on.

4. “One Last Ride”
“Parks and Recreation”

Was there a more purely 

joyful moment this year than 
when the inmates of Litchfield 
briefly escaped from prison 
and spent the day at a nearby 
beach? Everyone knows that 
it’s just a temporary excursion; 
soon, they’ll be rounded up 
and brought back. But for now, 
that’s okay.

Even forgetting about that 

moment at the lake, though, 
“Trust No Bitch” is full of excru-
ciatingly beautiful moments. 
Black Cindy’s (“Adrienne C. 
Moore, “30 Rock”) attempts to 
prove her Jewish beliefs turn 

from selfish to sincere in a stun-
ning monologue about faith. 
Morello (Yael Stone, “Spir-
ited”) weds her frequent visi-
tor Vince (John Magaro, “Not 
Fade Away”), inspiring tears 
from the stoic Healy (Michael 
J. Harney, “Deadwood”). In a 
series that usually (and right-
fully) lingers on the injustices 
of the criminal justice system, 
“Trust No Bitch” is the rare epi-
sode that celebrates life, friend-
ship and love. It’s absolutely 
awe-inspiring.

-BEN ROSENSTOCK

5. “Trust No Bitch”

“Orange is the New Black”

“We’ve got to wake up at a cer-

tain point and recognize what’s 
going on here!”

In perhaps the most poeti-

cally ironic statement of the year, 
Fox News correspondent Ger-
aldo Rivera made a resounding 
appeal for the Black Lives Matter 
movement when he attempted to 
criticize Kendrick Lamar’s per-
formance of “Alright” on the BET 
Awards. Forget that his idea of 
waking up involves completely 
disregarding the concerns of Black 
Americans and condemning rap 
music as the primary cause for 
their struggles (because it’s cer-
tainly not discrimination!). Wak-
ing up to Black Americans’ reality 
is what rap music — and Kendrick 
Lamar’s music especially — has 
always been about.

Accordingly, Lamar’s sopho-

more album, To Pimp a Butterfly, 
is a masterpiece of Black protest 
art. With the weight and intri-
cacy that carries this album, the 
genius of “Alright,” one of its most 
straightforward and commercial 
tracks, could be initially missed — 
it doesn’t take more than a single 
play to understand what “n***a, 
we gon’ be alright” means. But this 
kind of blunt activism is exactly 
what 2015 calls for. With its clear 
message highlighting police bru-
tality and the roiling racial ten-
sions across the country, “Alright” 
has become a clearly articulated 

rallying cry for the fight. Dem-
onstrations across the country 
have featured the infectious hook 
shouted alongside speeches by Al 
Sharpton and prayers for Freddie 
Gray, Sandra Bland and the scores 
of other Black men and women 
killed by police in 2015.

“Alright” also happens to be a 

fantastically well-executed hip-
hop song. The psychedelic pop 
energy that opens the track sus-
tains itself from start to finish, 
propelled by Lamar’s urgent deliv-
ery. It’s this energy that allows 
“Alright” to function both as a 
party-ready single and a protest-
ready chant. Many have listened 
to this song during a pre-game or 
on the way to the bar, enjoying the 
beat but failing to listen to the lyr-
ics and recognize its poignancy.

The powerful music video for 

the song, however, makes it clear 
that this isn’t typical radio fod-
der. Ending with a police offi-
cer shooting Lamar down like a 
hunter takes out a waterfowl to be 
hanged on the wall, the message 
of “Alright” is by no means made 
quaint or complacent. Yet, even 
with such a heavy burden, Lamar 
manages to keep the positivity. 
It’s something that we all need to 
remember, whether we’re facing a 
mountain of racial issues or you’re 
just worried about that upcoming 
test: we gon’ be alright.

-MATT GALLATIN

1. “Alright”

Kendrick Lamar

Is it R&B? Reggae? Meren-

gue? Drake drew from innu-
merable sources to synthesize 
“Hotline Bling,” seeming to 
anticipate 
everything 
con-

sumers would want as their 
anthem. A mix of musical styles 
just eclectic enough to be inter-
esting, but not enough to alien-
ate the mainstream listener, 
with lyrics specific enough 
to be believable but general 
enough for everyone to get 
behind and with a video from 
Director X with the potential 
for infinite meme adaptations: 
“Hotline Bling” has exploded 

into omnipresence. Drake said 
himself he drew inspiration 
from the creative process of 
dancehall — a derivative of 
reggae in which one or more 
DJs improvise over the same 
recorded or live beat — and the 
merengue-esque rhythm (and 
dance moves) are impossible 
to ignore. Take it for what you 
will — as a sexist anthem of a 
commodity fetish, that song 
you hate to love, that song you 
love to love or all three — we all 
know when that hotline bling.

5. “Hello” Adele

I’ll never shut up about her eye-

liner, and neither should you. And 
who knew sepia was still available 
as a filter? Was that a flip phone? 
Is that faux fur coat from Saks? 
Do they have Saks in London? 
These are the thoughts that cross 
our minds when “Hello” starts 
playing on the radio. All we have 
to do is hear those fatal opening 
lines in our cars, and we’re toast. 
Doomed. Goners. “Hello … it’s 
me.” (The ellipsis is essential.)

This instantaneous recall — 

and depression — is a testament 
to the strength of a signature aes-
thetic, of her music videos, her 

ballads, her voice. These ingre-
dients blend into one another, 
creating the acrylic-nailed, cher-
ub-voiced conglomeration that 
can only inhibit one name: Adele.

Let us not forget that Adele 

released this monumental tune 
a mere three months ago, in 
October. It quickly broke many 
records, achieving over a mil-
lion digital sales and 4.79 million 
online streams in a week. Its video 
surpassed Miley Cyrus’ “Wreck-
ing Ball” in acquiring around 27.7 
million views on YouTube within 
a 24-hour span. What more is 
there to say? After a painfully 

One of the many excellent 

aspects of AMC’s “Breaking Bad” 
spinoff, “Better Call Saul,” is its 
winning performances. While 
Bob Odenkirk (“W/ Bob and 
David”) continues to make Saul 
Goodman the most charismatic 
crooked lawyer of Albuquerque, 
it’s Jonathan Banks’s (“Commu-
nity”) acting as the hapless Mike 
Ehrmantraut that made “Better 
Call Saul” such a standout this 
past TV season. In the show’s 
sixth episode, “Five-O,” the non-
linear plot delves into Mike’s 

backstory as a Philadelphia cop 
and the mystery behind his son’s 
untimely murder. Though Oden-
kirk showed both comedic and 
dramatic depth as Saul, viewers 
got to see some raw emotion from 
the usually expressionless Mike. 
As both Saul and Mike grapple 
with morally ambiguous deci-
sions, “Five-O” plays out like some 
of “Breaking Bad” ‘s best episodes; 
it’s heartbreaking, thrilling and 
devastating to watch, making for 
powerful television.

-SAM ROSENBERG

2. “Five-O”

“Better Call Saul”

What happens when a self-

actualizing 
housewife, 
her 

stressed out husband and a 
misogynistic criminal are con-
fined inside a small cabin? The 
result is “Fargo” ’s eighth epi-
sode, “Loplop.” Fleeing from 
both sides of the law, Ed and 
Peggy Blumquist (Jesse Plemons, 
“Breaking Bad” and Kirsten 
Dunst, “Spider-Man”) hold one 
pursuer, Dodd Gerhardt (Jeffrey 
Donovan, “Burn Notice”), hos-
tage in a desperate bid to save 
their skins. A near-perfect dis-
play of dark humor unfolds as 
Ed realizes how in over his head 
he is and Peggy slowly loses her 
grip on reality to the detriment of 
Dodd. Between stabbings, failed 
extortion and cheesy Ronald 
Reagan movies, cabin fever sets 

in as everyone starts to go crazy.

As the couple bumbles through 

their kidnapping, the terrify-
ing Gerhardt enforcer Hanzee 
Dent (Zahn McClarnon, “Long-
mire”) circles closer and closer 
on their location, leaving a trail 
of violence in his wake. Stoically 
intimidating, 
Hanzee 
injects 

pure tension into every scene he 
inhabits. The show slowly brings 
his suffering to light as he lashes 
out against ignorant degradation.

A large part of “Fargo” ’s suc-

cess comes from its ability to 
make viewers laugh through 
their gasps of horror. “Loplop” 
exemplifies this tendency, setting 
itself apart in a season full of stel-
lar episodes.

Best TV Episodes of 2015

3. (Tie) “Hardhome”

“Game of Thrones”

Season five of “Game of 

Thrones” had its ups and 
downs. On the one hand, it 
failed to grow interest in 
major 
plotlines 
(*cough* 

Dorne *cough*) and completely 
ruined the character arc for the 
once strong Sansa Stark. How-
ever, there were some moments 
where the show reminded me 
why I loved it, and the biggest 
example was “Hardhome,” an 
episode of television that made 
every battle that came before it 
in the series look cheap. In the 
hour, Jon Snow (Kit Haring-
ton, “Pompeii”) leads a group 
of the Night’s Watch to a town 
of Wildlings to save them from 
the incoming White Walkers. 
What they, and us as view-
ers, were not expecting was a 
full-fledged battle between the 

parties. The episode’s visuals 
could compete with any from 
cinema, with broad landscape 
shots and brutal but beauti-
ful violence. One of the last 
shots of the episode, where the 
lead Walker raises his arms to 
bring the battle’s dead back to 
life, still sends shivers down 
my spine when I think of it. It 
established the White Walkers 
as a real threat, forever chang-
ing the course of one of televi-
sion’s most important series. 
There was nothing on TV in 
2015 that matched the scale 
and size of “Hardhome,” and 
there will likely be nothing 
that comes close, at least until 
the next season of “Thrones.”

4. “Let It Happen” Tame 

Impala

One of the most sacred respon-

sibilities in friend groups is 
bestowed upon he who manages 
the aux cord. In a room or car full 
of people with eclectic tastes in 
music, it’s crucial to select some-
thing that everyone can vibe to. 
There’s always the classic rock 
enthusiast, the hip-hop head, the 
“whatever is on the radio” type, 
and the aux cord DJ has to manage 

all of these personalities by play-
ing something universally agreed 
upon as “dope.”

“Let It Happen” is just that: a 

certified aux cord crowd-pleaser. 
Despite clocking in at damn near 
eight minutes, no one ever seems 
to notice its ridiculous length. The 
only moment that might cause 
some head-scratching is about 
halfway through, when Kevin 

lengthy hiatus, people wanted 
Adele back. And she came to us, 
finally, in 2015.

The thing is, though, it’s 

not the videos, the glitz or the 
glam that cemented her place 
on our list. All of that helps the 
situation, yes, but Adele’s funda-
mental magnetism is her voice. 
Equally smoky as it is powerful, 
that London-laced instrument 
has spawned some of the best 
ballads of the decade. Drake 
couldn’t have sung the sump-
tuously 
devastating 
“Some-

one Like You.” Selena Gomez 
wouldn’t be able to carry “Chas-
ing Pavements” past the first 
verse, not in a hundred years. 
Can Ellie Goulding’s pint-sized 
pipes handle “Rolling in the 

Deep”? Ahem.

Alas, no one could’ve said 

“Hello” to us as melodiously 
as our most favorite Brit, prob-
ably the finest talent to cross the 
pond since Winehouse. Adele is 
able to twist a phrase, a banal 
word, into a mellifluous plea 
that somehow taps at that little 
empty space in our hearts, put 
there in the first place by some 
awful ex-boyfriend, girlfriend, 
lover, life. And in doing so she 
reassures us we’re not alone out 
there, in the sepia-toned day-
light. She’s here for us.

“Hello,” she says, unapologet-

ically. “It’s me.” 

And I can’t stop staring at her 

eyeliner.

Parker seems to mash his fist on a 
particular excerpt that loops just 
long enough for everyone to notice. 
But then there’s “the drop.” Across 
all genres and personalities, every-
one loves a good drop, and this one 
more than delivers.

At this point in the song the 

vocals return for a now-familiar 
melody, but this time soaked in 
a Daft Punk-esque vocoder that 
makes it pleasantly indecipherable 
(word to Young Thug). Countless 
synths layer on top of one another 
to build a tastefully pop, angelic 
banger. The title alone suggests 
some sort of divine advice you 

already know but need to hear 
from someone else. Parker almost 
commands you towards the end of 
the track with “Try to get through 
it / Try to push through it / Take 
the next ticket / Take the next 
train.” Does the power of Tame 
Impala compel you to fight the 
current, as the vortex-shedding 
album cover suggests? Or perhaps 
just let it happen and see where 
the tide takes you? Or maybe you 
should focus on what you’re play-
ing after this? I don’t know, man.

Best 

Albums of 

2015
2. Currents
Tame Impala

Apparently, 
people 
actually 

take the time to stalk my music 
preferences on Tinder because I 
got a message from Luke, eager to 
know what I thought of Currents. 
Both Tame Impala fans, Luke and 
I hit it off immediately. We both 
agreed — Currents is the Austra-
lian band’s best album to date. But 
unfortunately for us, we disagreed 
on the album’s best songs. Luke 
jams to “Let It Happen” and “Past 
Life,” but when I claimed that 
“The Moment” and “Eventually” 
are the best songs on the album 
I was promptly unmatched. It’s 
whatever; I’m over it. I’m over it 
because obviously I’m right. “The 
Moment” and “Eventually” are 
both smooth indie classics that 
have already secured a tenured 
spot on my “car tunes” playlist and 

my “summer vibes” playlist. These 
songs, like the 11 others that com-
prise Currents, demonstrate just 
how ephemeral psychedelic indie 
rock can be. Tame Impala man-
aged to produce a magical 13-track 
album that’s perfect for any occa-
sion. You can play it when you 
~chill~, you can burn incense and 
dream about Coachella to it and 
you can even use the soundtrack 
to justify buying things you can’t 
afford at Urban Outfitters. Addi-
tionally, it makes for the perfect, “I 
don’t want to go to class but let me 
walk melancholially to class any-
way” album. You can even *gasp* 
just lay in bed and listen to the 
album on repeat without wanting 
to look at your phone to Snapchat 
the moment.

3. Sometimes I Sit and Think 

and Sometimes I Just Sit

Courtney Barnett

Last March I volunteered to 

review Courtney Barnett’s debut 
album Sometimes I Sit and Think 
and Sometimes I Just Sit with-
out knowing anything about her 
music. In the review, I gave it a B+. 
Almost ten months later I can only 
think “what the fuck?” My review 
wasn’t wrong, I thought her album 
was good, but it’s stunning. It’s 
without a doubt an A+.

Sometimes I Sit … is a lyri-

cal masterpiece. Barnett throws 
11 short scenes at listeners and 
expects them to keep up through-
out the entire ride. Every track is 
lyrically dense no matter the speed 
of delivery. “Pedestrian at Best,” 
“Nobody Really Cares If You 
Don’t” and “Debbie Downer” are 
the catchiest and offer the most 
insight into Barnett’s internal (and 
beautiful) ramblings.

Others offer less catch and 

drone on. “Small Poppies” morphs 
rock star guitars and monotone 
delivery of “an eye for an eye for 
an eye for an eye,” creating one 

of the most weirdly pleasurable 
tracks on the LP. “Kim’s Caravan” 
is soft-spoken reflection on Aus-
tralia’s coral reef that builds with 
repetition and tone. “Depreston” 
does the opposite — Barnett talks 
through a story of looking to buy 
a house in Depreston that “seems 
depressing.” The track ultimately 
finds its center on the repetition 
of the realtor’s line “If you’ve got 
a spare half a million, you could 
knock it down and start rebuild-
ing.” Each delivery drives home 
Barnett’s point. It emphasizes 
the ridiculousness of the trip and 
exemplifies Barnett’s ability to 
beautify the mundane.

Barnett killed 2015. Her debut 

album was praised. She was one 
nomination the VMAs got right. 
She played killer shows across the 
world. (I saw her at Bonnaroo and 
it was transcendent.) Now, in 2016 
she’s going for “Best New Artist” 
at the Grammys. It should be a no-
brainer who wins this year.

4. Carrie & Lowell

Sufjan Stevens

Listening to Sufjan Stevens is 

great for when you need a good 
cry, when you miss someone or 
when you suddenly remember that 
abandoned cat you saw three years 
ago and can’t stop wondering 
what happened to it. But really, he 
makes you think. Playing Stevens’s 
record requires a confrontation 
with your being — it’s impossible 
to take in his signature spry instru-
mentation and delicate vocals 
without at least being prompted 
to think about something big-
ger than yourself. Carrie & Lowell 

tackles Stevens’s relationship with 
his mother and stepfather — their 
lives, struggles, deaths and beliefs. 
Stevens holds nothing back, tack-
ling the most intimate of questions 
regarding what it means to be in a 
family, both the good and the bad. 
The album is gentle and beauti-
ful, with Stevens’s pleasant voice 
contrasting his emotionally heavy 
lyrics. Carrie & Lowell is a master-
ful, standout addition to Stevens’s 
already impressive body of work.

5. Art Angels

Grimes

Artist and producer Claire 

Boucher, better known for her 
most recent project as Grimes, 
delivers in her highly anticipated 
follow-up to her 2012 release, 
Visions. Released in November, 
Art Angels is avant-garde; it’s 
kawaii; it’s horrifying; it’s incred-
ible. Grimes ushers listeners to 
their seats with “laughing and 
not being normal,” violin and 
synth chords clashing against one 
another, a sinister organ and her 
vocals verging on choral yielding 
a sonic aesthetic that places 19th-
century gothic in the present. But 
straightaway we’re brought into 
“California,” which plays with 
juxtaposition once more, its fluid 
guitar and sugary sound pushed 
against melancholic lyrics of the 
ephemeral 
and 
dehumanizing 

nature of hype. Juxtapositions 

and contradictions are every-
where in this album: “California” 
sounds sweet but then we get 
“SCREAM,” an ice-hot and semi-
horrifying nu-metal collaboration 
with Taiwanese DJ Aristophanes. 
She’s avant-pop but unrelentingly 
claims to represent the alternative, 
to press against what we think 
of as going together. Art Angels 
shows us that women can do the 
technical work of producers, that 
producers can be experimental 
artists, that cute can be “too scary 
to be objectified” (in the artist’s 
own words), that happy and angry 
can coexist, that pop can be alter-
native, that the individual can be 
whatever they want to be, and that 
life is fucking confusing and dark 
and fun all at once, all the time.

2. Audra McDonald

On the evening of Septem-

ber 17, Hill Auditorium was 
packed with an audience eager 
to see the widely known and 
beloved 
Audra 
McDonald, 

who returned to UMS for her 
sixth appearance in concert. 
McDonald is a six-time Tony 
Award winner and has found 
her place both on the stages 
of Broadway and the opera. 
Her concert’s set list borrowed 
from various works, opening 
with “Sing Happy” from Flora 
the Red Menace, and including 
Sondheim’s “Moments in the 
Woods” from “Into the Woods,” 
“Maybe This Time” from “Cab-
aret,” “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” 
from “The Sound of Music” 
and concluding with “Over the 
Rainbow” from “The Wizard 
of Oz.” The concert also fea-
tured music from McDonald’s 
most recent recorded work, 

an album titled Go Back Home. 
UMS ticket holders responded 
to McDonald’s performance 
with raving reviews, describ-
ing the concert as “amazing” 
and 
“fantastic,” 
believing 

McDonald to be someone who 
has an “incredible understand-
ing of what drives the human 
soul.” McDonald’s vocal range 
is remarkable and audiences 
are continuously amazed by 
the range of musical theater 
pieces she is able to perform. 
Her most compelling gift, aside 
from the inordinate talent she 
already demonstrates, is her 
storytelling 
through 
music 

which leaves audiences cap-
tivated and in awe of not only 
her vocal abilities, but also the 
stories she tells through them.

3. Patti Smith

On October 8th at the State 

Theatre, musician and writer 
Patti Smith read from her new-
est book “M Train,” a book that 
serves as something of patch-
work, chronicling moments of 
her life spanning from Café Ino, 
a lower Manhattan coffeeshop, 
to Frida Kahlo’s Casa Azul in 
Coyoacán, Mexico. Smith invites 
the reader to explore various 
settings, historical moments and 
landscapes that influence the 
writing and music she has pro-
duced. The stories are punctu-
ated by Smith’s black and white 
photographs 
and 
moments 

where the lines between poetry, 
prose, reality and imagination 
are blurred. During the event, 
she read from a couple of chap-
ters of the book and an audience 
Q&A followed. In her responses 
to the Q&A, Smith was blunt and 
direct, providing unvarnished 
insight into the philosophies 
that have inspired her work as 
an artist. She spoke of her art 
as an obligation, one that she 
had always managed to fit in 

around raising a family, work-
ing odd jobs and coping with 
the loss of her beloved hus-
band, Fred “Sonic” Smith. She 
boldly denied the notion that 
art is a mere hobby or profes-
sion — stating that to artists it is 
like food or shelter, a need that 
is crippling when unfulfilled. 
When asked about the practice 
of well-known artists pursu-
ing activism, Smith, who has 
often called for an alleviation of 
injustice in her music and writ-
ing, suggested that artists were 
not responsible for activism. She 
did suggest, however, that pop 
stars should “pool together their 
money and bail out our cities.” 
Although only the reading and 
Q&A were advertised, Smith 
surprised the audience with 
a performance of her 1983 hit 
“Because the Night,” accompa-
nied by her son Jackson Smith, 
leaving her signature mark as 
the godmother of punk.

4. Sankai Juru

As the lights slowly dimmed, 

an audible diminuendo spread 
throughout the Power Center, 
which was filled to capacity with 
people 
sitting 
collectively 
in 

stilled breath. There in the quiet 
and 
semi-darkness, 
the 
lone 

source of light emanated from 
the stage before the audience, in 
the form of a soft glow reflecting 
off a pillar of falling sand, which 
gracefully streamed from the 
ceiling to the floor. If one were 
to listen closely enough, the soft 
sound of the earth-bound par-
ticles landing could be heard; as 
the minutes passed, the shift-
ing pile beneath the pillar began 
to multiply. Into the light of the 
stage stepped a figure of some-
what androgynous appearance, 
bald and covered in white powder, 
wearing long flowing garments. 
Slowly, the figure began to dance, 
and over the course of the evening 
he was joined by others similarly 
adorned. The dancers were all 
members of the Japanese dance 
group Sankai Juku. The ensemble 

is dedicated to Butoh, a Japanese 
avant-garde dance form which 
originated in the 1960s as a means 
to express the intensely grotesque 
and perverse. Throughout the 
performance, the dancers embod-
ied numerous moods and ideas, 
often juxtaposing extreme still-
ness with rapid movement, mov-
ing in and out of shifting scenes 
of colored light, as ethereal music 
enveloped the space. At one point, 
the dancers opened their mouths 
and seemed to scream silently at 
the sky in a moment of cathartic 
release. At another moment, they 
lay on the floor, curled fetus-like 
into balls, periodically scrabbling 
against the ground in order to 
shift their position. At the end of 
the evening, the audience walked 
away from the performance with 
a melancholy mix of emotions, 
having witnessed something pro-
foundly sad, yet undeniably beau-
tiful.

Best Viral Videos of 2015

1. Drake’s “Hotline Bling” 

Music Video

It seemed like the Internet 

was imploding when Drake 
blessed us with his flashy new 
moves in the “Hotline Bling” 
music video. The minimalistic 
set allowed viewers to gawk 
indefinitely at the 28-year-old 
rapper’s quirky dancing, which 
quickly racked up over 307 mil-
lion views and infinitely more 
imitators. In true 2015 fashion, 
fans took to social media to 
share their interpretations of 
Drake’s choreo. Memes circled 
the web of Drake tossing pep-
peroni slices, destroying at 
Wii tennis and playing with 

light sabers. Even Democratic 
presidential candidate Bernie 
Sanders joined the revolution 
as Ellen DeGeneres super-
imposed his Drake-inspired 
moves onto the “Hotline Bling” 
music video stage, yet another 
example of the way politics 
were taken just as seriously as 
this generation’s most promi-
nent rappers. Drake taught us 
to pair turtlenecks with sweat-
pants and reminded everyone 
in 2015 to dance like no one 
was watching.

2. Alanis Morissette sings 
“Ironic” with James Corden

2015 was the last year of a 

period of upheaval in the late 
night space, as staples such as 
Jon Stewart and David Letter-
man said goodbye, and new-
bies, like James Corden, took 
the reins. Cordon treats his 
show like a variety show, with 
similarities to the current ver-
sion of “The Tonight Show.” He 
is best known for his Carpool 
Karaoke segment, where he 
and a singer will drive around 
in a car. However, my favorite 
segment was this one where 
Corden and Alanis Morissette 
updated the lyrics of Moris-
sette’s hit “Ironic” for the 
digital age. Instead of “rain on 

your wedding day,” there’s “An 
old friend sends you a Face-
book request / And you only 
find out they’re racist after you 
accept.” Or, “It’s a traffic jam 
when you tried to use Waze.” 
He and Morissette have a clear 
chemistry, which makes their 
mid-song 
interactions 
even 

more fun. Corden is an under-
the-radar talent and is actually 
beating Jimmy Fallon at his 
own game. Hopefully 2016 is a 
year where more people notice 
his talent because he’s only 
going to be creating more seg-
ments like this.

3. “Things Everybody Does 
But Doesn’t Talk About, Ft. 

President Obama”

BuzzFeed has no shortage of 

hilarious videos to distract us from 
our responsibilities, but this video 
takes the cake. The video, featur-
ing the leader of the free world, 
promotes the launch of health-
care.gov, but mostly reminds us 
how cool the President is. No plat-
form is out of bounds for Obama to 
reach constituents, and BuzzFeed 
is no exception. In under two min-
utes, the President shows us how 
relatable he is by practicing his 
finger guns and checking himself 
out in the mirror, taking pictures 

with a selfie stick, stumbling over 
the pronunciation of “February,” 
doodling a picture of Michelle in 
a notebook and practicing some 
fake free throw shots while no 
one’s looking. He even sarcasti-
cally mutters “Thanks, Obama” 
after he fails to dunk a cookie in 
his glass of milk. Though 2015 was 
filled with criticism for Obama, he 
takes amusement in it while get-
ting a message out, making this 
one of the year’s most entertaining 
videos.

4. “Close Encounter”

“Saturday Night Live” might 

not be as funny as it once was 
— according to my parents and a 
bunch of other people who were 
watching it before I was born, 
etc. — but every once in a while, 
they come up with something 
truly hilarious. A sketch titled 
“Close Encounters” is one of the 
best that “SNL” has seen in the 
past few years, and it went viral 
for good reason. Cecily Strong, 
Kate McKinnon and host Ryan 
Gosling are interrogated by 
government officials (Aidy Bry-
ant and Bobby Moynihan) about 
their alien abduction. While 
Strong and Gosling had experi-
ences with a creature made of 
“pure light,” McKinnon’s char-
acter had a different ordeal, 
with 40 gray aliens, steel bowls 

and a lack of pants.

McKinnon’s 
performance 

is what makes the sketch an 
instant hit. Breaking character 
is something “SNL” ’s actors 
generally try to avoid, but 
“Close Encounters” wouldn’t 
have been nearly as funny if the 
actors didn’t break. The mirth 
in McKinnon’s eyes as she ashes 
her cigarette and gently begins 
“batting” Strong’s “knockers” 
as a demonstration is reason 
enough to press “replay.” Gos-
ling just gives up, laughing into 
his shirt. They are having just 
as much fun performing as we 
are watching, and that’s what 
makes it great. That, and Kate 
McKinnon.

5. DJ Khaled’s 
Inspirational 

Video

I 
watched 
DJ 
Khaled’s 

“Motivational 
Speech” 
on 

YouTube for the first time 
before finals in December. My 
roommate, her sides splitting, 
grabbed me as I was heading 
out to study and handed me her 
phone. Just under two minutes, 
the video centers on Khaled, 
wearing a sweatsuit and bling, 
as he delivers an inspirational 

speech 
that’s 
absurd 
and 

uplifting at the same time. 
The gist of the speech is this: 
“We the best. You smart, you 
very smart. You loyal,” and his 
catch phrase, “Another one.” 
As he explains, “another one” 
refers to push-ups or crunches, 
where you get on the floor while 
Khaled coaches you to your 
better self. The “All I Do is Win” 

producer repeats the phrase 
several 
times, 
emphasizing 

that we should “win no matter 
what,” whether it’s finishing a 
set of push-ups or buying houses 
for our mamas. Ridiculous? Yes. 
But exactly what we needed 
to get through the semester. 
Another one!
