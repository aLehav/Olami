Landmark research
will test new
Lou Gehrig's
Disease treatment
By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter
In a major victory for propo-
nents of stem cell research, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion approvedthe first-ever human
clinical trial of a stem cell treat-
ment for Lou Gehrig's Disease last
Friday. The study will be lead by a
University of Michigan expert in
the field.
Dr. Eva Feldman, the director
of both the U-M Amyotrophic Lat-
eral Sclerosis (ALS) Clinic and the
Program for Neurology Research
and Discovery, helped develop the
treatment and will act as principal
investigator for the landmark trial.
Feldman worked with a team
of neurologists to develop the new
protocol for injecting stem cells
into the spinal chord of patients.
This system, researchers hope, will
reconnect severed lines of com-
munication between the cells of
paralyzed ALS patients and delay
or reverse some of the disease's
effects.
In an interview yesterday, Feld-

man discussed the study and what
lies ahead for her team of research-
ers.
ALS, commonly known as Lou
Gehrig's Disease, is a progressive
neural degenerative disorder that
affects roughly 30,000 Americans,
according to the ALS Association.
About 5,600 people in this coun-
try are diagnosed with the disease
every year - or 15 new cases every
day.
The disease affects nerve cells
in the brain leading to the degen-
eration of motor neurons in the
spinal chord. The patient eventu-
ally loses control of all voluntary
muscle movement. Cognitive func-
tions are usually left undamaged.
Notable figures suffering from
ALS include renowned physicist
Stephen Hawking and musician
Jason Becker.
"Currently ALS is a fatal neuro-
degenerative disease," said Feld-
man. "The only available treatment
is medication given by mouth."
Though these medications
slow the progression of the dis-
ease, Feldman said, they may only
increase survival by around three
to five months.
The clinical treatment injects
stem cells directly into the spinal
cord, protecting at-risk motor neu-
rons and potentially rebuilding
severed connections.

700 seats meant to
accomodate more
than 3,000 residents
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Staff Reporter
Waiting to get food at the Hill
Dining Center in Mosher-Jordan
Hall can be a long process.

During prime dining hours -
from 12-1 p.m. and 5-6 p.m. - the
line to enter the dining center can
extend up the stairs that lead to
the dining hall. And once inside,
students say finding a seat can be
an even more demanding task.
For example, LSA sophomore
Emily Bozeksaid she triesto avoid
the cafeteria's peak hours because
the food lines can be a pretty big
hassle.

"When I see a long line I usu-
ally just don't go in it," she said.
"It really affects what I eat. When
I see a line for the regular food
that's going out the door I just
go and make myself a sandwich
because I don't have time."
The cause of the bottleneck?
The obvious answer is the sheer
number of students living near
the dining center, which, after the
University stopped serving meals

in the Couzens and Alice Lloyd
Residence Halls, is one of the only
cafeterias left in that area.
Peter Logan, director of Hous-
ing Communications, said the
dining center was built to accom-
modate about 640 people in the
larger dining area and an addi-
tional 70 people can find seating
in the dining area upstairs around
the Victors plaza - so room for

Squirrel starts power outage

MICHIGAN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
MSA considers health care help

Many campus
buildings left in dark
yesterday evening
By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
A power outage that swept cam-
pus yesterday evening was brought
on by an unlikely culprit.
Most University buildings on
the Central and Medical Campuses
were left in the dark just after 6 p.m.
yesterday when a squirrel shorted
a transformer at the University's
Central Power Plant, according
o Department of Public Safety
Spokeswoman Diane Brown.
Throughout yesterday night,
the Daily received reports of out-

ages in the following buildings:
Shapiro Library, Hatcher Graduate
Library, the University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art, Michigan
Union, C.C. Little, South Quad,
West Quad, Angell Hall, the LSA
Building, Tisch Hall, the School
of Education, the School of Social
Work, the Ross School of Business
and the Dennison Building.
The outages lasted anywhere
from a few minutes to hours,
Brown said.
"Often when electricity is lost,
depending on how the circuits
are impacted, it can sometimes ...
reboot easily and in other cases it
may affect a fuse or something,"
she said.
Aslate as9:30p.m.lastnight,some
buildings were still without power,
including the School of Education

Building, accordingtoBrown.
LSA sophomore Kendra Furry
said she was in an English class
on the ground floor of Angell Hall
when the power went out.
"Wewere allsortofweirdedout,"
she said. "The teacher went to look
for another classroom we could go
in but the lights were all out."
Furry said the class was moved
outside, but had to be ended early
since the teacher needed a chalk-
board.
Naomi Makofsky, president of
Michigan Advertisement and Mar-
keting, was leading a mass meeting at
the Union when the lightswentoff.
"We continued in the dark," she
said. "Everyone stayed."
She said power in the Union
came on after about 15 or 20
minutes.

Assembly also
addresses budget
woes, homecoming
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily News Editor
A resolution was presented to
the assembly last night to support
U.S. Senate legislation that would
provide health care assistance to
students.

The legislation, drafted by the
Senate Committee on Health Edu-
cation Labor and Pensions, would
allow individu-
als to remain on NOTEBOOK
their parents'
health care plans until the age 26.
If the resolution passes, MSA
willeducate the studentbody about
the legislation during an MSA Diag
Day and will provide students with
resources to write their represen-
tatives in Congress.
"(The legislation is) impor-

tant for students in this economy
because it's hard to find a job,
especially one that provides health
care," said LSA Rep. Chris Arm-
strong, who authored the reso-
lution with Business Reps. Alex
Serwer and Jason Raymond.
The resolution stated that indi-
viduals from ages 19 to 29 make
up the largest group of uninsured
individuals in the country, which
the authors said makes the legisla-
tion a significant issue for college

BAR FIGHT
Altercation at Charley's leaves one

With knife drawn,
man misses target,
stabs bystander
By JACOB SMILOVITZ
ManagingNews Editor
Just before 1:15 a.m. early yes-
terday morning, a fight broke out
at Good Time Charley's that ended
with one bystander being sent to
the hospital with "superficial" stab
Uwounds and another man in police

custody.
The fight began between two
men who were standing inside the
popular bar located on South Uni-
versity Avenue, according to Lieu-
tenant Myron Blackwell of the Ann
Arbor Police Department.
As the two people fought, a knife
was pulled at some point which
didn't appear to scare the other
person in the fight who was "obvi-
ously not afraid of the guy with the
knife," Blackwell said.
After the knife was drawn, the
second person said something

along the lines of "get that knife out
of here," Blackwell said.
The first person then made a
move with the knife that, as Black-
well describes, apparently missed
the second person, but struck a
third person in the chest causing
"very superficial wounds."
Thethirdperson,whowas"total-
ly not related to anything" accord-
ing to Blackwell, is not believed to
have played any role in the original
fight. That person is expected to be
treated and released from the hos-

150 years of singing

With a history extending
hack to 1859, the Men's Glee
lob is the oldest continually
run student organization at
the University.
"at formed mainly at first
not necessarily as a singing
group but as more of a social
group," Glee Club President
Drew Smith said. "But at the
same time, singing was a big
part of it."
Smith said the club was ini-
tially a loose arrangement of
both vocals and instrumen-
tals but eventually evolved
into a more structured cho-
rus. Now it stands alongside
Harvard's Glee Club as one
of the most prestigios of its
type in the United States.
The club is comprised of
four vocal sections and cur-
rently has 103 members. The
group performs repertoires

chosen by Director Paul Ear-
din, who is also an associ-
ate professor in the School
of Music, Theatre '& Dance,
with music selections vary-
ing from folk songs to Latin
Renaissance pieces.
The club rehearses twice a
week and performs every fall
and spring at Mill Auditorium.
In addition, it tours the state
of Michigan and the Midwest
twice a year and internation-
ally every four years.
"We've been to every con-
tinent except for Africa on
our tours," Smith said. "So
we're pretty well traveled as
a group."
For its 150th anniversary,
the club plans to celebrate by
premiering a piece commis-
sioned from former faculty
member William Bolcom. The
group plans to invite Glee

Club alumni to a celebration
weekend in the spring.
Maintaining connections
with alumni is an important
part of the Glee Club.
"One thing that's great
about the Glee Club is that
you get such a strong alumni
base. We'll talk to people
from 20, 30 years ago," said
Joe Wieciek, the assistant
alumni relations manager
and co-150th anniversary
coordinator.
Wieciek also said the group
is trying to create an alumni
tour group to further main-
tain the alumni bond.
As part of its 150th celebra-
lion, the Glee Club is set to
perform Nov. 21 at Hill Audi-
torium featuring an Ameni-
can-themed repertoire.

GM raising output
at three factories
General Motors Co. will go to
24-hour operations at factories in
Kansas, Michigan and Indiana to
handle an expected increase in
demand and to make up for produc-
tion lost from a large-scale factory
consolidation announced earlier in
the year.
The automaker says it will add
a third shift at its Fairfax plant in
Kansas City, Kan., in January. That
will be followed in March or April
by third shifts at factories in Delta
Township, Mich., near Lansing, and
Fort Wayne, Ind.
About 2,400 production work-
ers will be recalled as a result of the
added shifts, and another 600 will
be recalled at parts factories across
the country, said Tim Lee, group vice
president for global manufacturing.
The increases announced yester-
day, coupled with other production
increases unveiled during the sum-
mer, will allow GM to raise North
American production from about 1.9
million vehicles this year to 2.8 mil-
lion in 2010, Lee said.

Local police working with federal
agents carried out a string of early-
morning raids seeking key members
of the Avenues street gang, a long-
standing group that claims as its
territory a swath of northeast Los
Angeles. About 90 suspects were
named in a massive federal rack-

China vows action on climate threat

In first U.N. speech,
Obama says
United States is
"determined to act"
China laid down a significant
plan for curbing greenhouse gases
yesterday, outlining ambitious goals
of planting enough forest to cover an
area the size of Norway and gener-
ating 15 percent of its energy needs
from renewable sources within a
decade.
Chinese President Hu Jintao
also promised at the opening of the
United Nations climate summit that
the communist nation would take
"determined and practical steps"
to boost its nuclear energy, improve
energy efficiency and reduce "by
a notable margin" the growth rate
of its carbon pollution as measured
against economic growth.
Experts were watching the Chi-
nese closely because it had in the
past largely ignored global efforts
to diminish emissions. The goals Hu
outlined also were held in contrast to
the United States, where the Senate

hasyet to take up climate legislation
and likely will not have produced a
new law by the time world leaders
gather this December in Copenha-
gen, Denmark, to negotiate a treaty
to replace the 1997 Kyoto pact.
"At stake in the fight against cli-
mate change are the common inter-
ests of the entire world," Hu said.
"Out of a sense of responsibility to
its own people and people across the
world, China fully appreciates the
importance and urgency of address-
ing climate change."
But China and some other
major fast-developing econo-
mies will not agree to binding
greenhouse-gas cuts. Developing
nations "should not ... be asked
to take on obligations that go
beyond their development stage,"
Hu said. Beijing wants to link
emissions to growth in gross
domestic product, meaning itnstill
may increase emissions even as it
takes fundamental steps to curb
them in the long run.
Much attention also was fixed on
U.S. President Barack Obama's first
U.N. speech, where he said the Unit-
ed States is "determined to act."

Students eat at the Hill Dining Center last night. Some have complained that the dining hall can't accomodate nearby residents.

DINING CENTER
From Page 1A
about 710 people.
But according to the University
Housing website, about 3,090 stu-
dents live in the Hill area.
Delays became a greater con-
cern this year when the 400 or
so residents who moved into the
recently re-opened and revamped
Stockwell Residence Hall this fall
joined the crowd of approximately
2,700 students who reside in the
Mary Markley, Mosher-Jordan,
Couzens and Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Halls.
Logan said that though no resi-
dence hall is technically assigned
to a specific dining hall, due to its
location, the Hill Dining Center
generally serves students living in
the Hill residence halls. He added
that that was not the main point of
the dining center, though.
"The Hill Dining Center was
really built as more of a dining
destination location as opposed
to a specific dining hall designed
only for certain students," he
said.
Though Logan said he recog-
nizes that because of the dining
center's location and the lack of
dining halls in most of the Hill
residence halls the Hill Dining
Center would be the most logical

students.
"We tried to take this complex,
giant issue and bring it to fun-
damentals and relevancy to stu-
dents," Raymond said. "It's less
symbolic and more action based."
The resolution is likely to be
voted on at next week's meeting.
MSA REFORMS BUDGET TO
CUT COSTS
MSA presented a summarized
budget last night that demonstrat-
ed a clear move to increase fiscal
discipline in assembly spending.
The executive board noted that
a spending cut was necessary
because the current system won't
be viable for the assembly in the
following years.
"We will look to see that MSA's
budget is sustainable for year's
forward, which right now it's not,"
said MSA Treasurer Vishal Bajaj.
MSA Vice President Mike
Rorro said the budget issues are
not because of fiscal irresponsibil-
ity or overspending, but because
of a shift in professional staffing.
Rorro said that about five or six
years a9o the Division of Student"

choice for all students living in the
Hill area.
Despite the additional 400 stu-
dentsfrom Stocklwgl livingithe
Hill area this year, Kathy White-
side, Menu Systems & Nutrition
Information manager, said there
aren't too many more students
going to the Hill Dining Center
than there were last year.
"It might appear to be more
crowded," she said. "But I think
part of it is just students settling
in and adjusting to their schedules
and figuring out where they want
to eat."
Logan echoed this senti-
ment, saying he anticipates that
once students settle in, the din-
ing center will probably be less
crowded.
"It has been busy," he said. "We
were anticipating all along that
we would need to provide seat-
ing for students who used to eat
in the variety of four different
dining halls. We figure that the
rush is due to new students prob-
ably not yet settled into their meal
routines and their daily campus
schedules."
He added that the Hill Dining
Center is fully equipped to accom-
modate the Stockwell residents.
Logan said students from Mar-
kley and Oxford Hall also tend to
use the Hill Dining Center.
Whiteside said there is a mas-
Affairs provided professional
assistance to MSA, but because of
budget cuts at the University, Stu-
dent Affairs limited those profes-
sional resources.
MSA was then forced to hire
more professional staff to fill the
void. Although this transition
happened years ago, Rorro said
the financial burden has finally
caught up to MSA.
Rorro said that rollover funds
covered these costs in previous
years but that the surplus is now

MSA President Abhishek Mah-
anti said the limited funds were
also a result of more money being
allocated to committees and com-
missions because of increased
activity on campus.
He added in the decreased rev-
enue from AirBus as a factor too.
AirBus is an MSA-funded shut-
tle to the airport during official
school breaks. He said MSA plans
to advertise the shuttle more, in
hopes of increasing revenue.
MSA funded student groups
will not be negatively affected and
they might even see an increase
in their budgets because of the
changes, Mahanti said.
He also said if MSA can't make

HOMECOMING BUDGET
APPROVED
In its weekly meeting last
night, the Michigan Student
Assembly passed a resolution to
authorize expenses for three days
of homecoming events that will
begin tomorrow.
This year's homecoming -
themed, "Those who stay will be
champions" - will kick off with
a "Burrito Mile" on Palmer Field.
Participants will eat a burritothen
race for one mile. bd's Mongolian
Grill will donate $5,000 worth of
food for participants and specta-
tors at the event.
Several student performances
by groups like Dance 2X and
the Michigan Bhangra Team - a
group that tries to raise awareness
of Punjabi culture through perfor-
mance - will follow the race.
The assembly will also host an
alumni tailgate Saturday before
the game.
Last year, the assembly spent
$12,000 on homecoming, accord-
ing to Rorro. Homecoming will
be about one-quarter of that cost
this year.

Bulking up rec programs
University must renovate campus recreational facilities
he University's recreational sports facilities need to
get in better shape - or at least that's what a Univer-
sity committee determined last spring. But instead of
implementing the committee's suggestions, the University has
decided to slim down the hours that recreational facilities will
remain open. Citing financial reasons, less-attended morningand*
evening hours at the Intramural Sports Building have already
been cut. But the quality of the buildings will only continue to
worsen if they aren't improved for faculty members who pay
to use them. The University needs to invest in the health of its
students and faculty by investing in the health of its recreational

sports facilities.
In 2007, the University created the Rec-
reational Sports Task Force to examine
how to improve recreational sports facili-
ties at the University. The task force's find-
ings, which were made public in March,
showed the University lagging far behind
its peers. For example, only Purdue and
Penn State have fewer square feet of rec-
reational facilities per student than Michi-
gan, and only Penn State and Michigan
haven't built new facilities since 1983. The
task force's findings have been for the most
part set aside, and the decision to cut the
IM Building's early morning and evening
hours seems to contradict the intentions of
the task force's recommendations.
Administrators have argued that the
change in IM Building hourswas necessary
because income from faculty membership
dues to University recreational facilities
has decreased. But declining member-
ships have probably been brought on by
neglect of these facilities. Cutting hours
in the morning and the evening will only
further discourage faculty use by increas-
ing overcrowding at facilities during peak.
hours, and in turn lose the University more
memberships. Unless the University starts
making improvements, the facilities will
only get worse.
And they're already in poor condition.
Gym users frequently complain about
long waiting lines, inadequate equip-

ment and unsanitary conditions. The task
force has recommended increasing floor
space by 60,000 square feet, replacing
old machines, reworking space to create
a more inviting feel and making needed
improvements to things like the ventila-
tion systems. These aren't unreasonable
changes - schools like Miami University
in Ohio have opted to build entirely new
facilities - and if administrators are seri-
ous about encouraging a healthy campus
community, they must fix the recreation-
al centers.
Considering that health care costs are an
enormous expenditure at the University,
fitness centers shouldn't be where cuts are
made. While the budget is certainly tight,
increasing the quality of recreational cen-
ters is an investment in the future health
of the University community. The enor-
mous necessity to students and faculty out-
weighs the costs.
The University's comparatively deficient
facilities are embarrassing, especially con-
sidering the University's supposed dedi-
cation to a healthy community. While the
University should look for ways to cut costs
and keep tuition affordable, it shouldn't do
so at the expense of recreational facilities
that are already lagging. Administrators
should expand services and upgrade exist-
ing facilities to the level of quality that stu-
dents and faculty deserve.

Before we get to today's exciting
topic, I'd like to clear up some
rumors:
It's true that I
solved the health
care problem
before any other ~
Daily columnists.
But I have more
important news.
Yesterday, the
autumnal equi-
nox occurred for WILL
the billionth time GRUNDLER
in a row, meaning
today it's officially
fall, meaning our
warm weather will disappear soon.
Honestly, you would think just once,
we could have a year-long summer. But
thisis Michigan. Fall isn'tsobad,right?
There are pretty colors and nice smells
and a profound sense of the cyclical
nature of life as our little world starts
to die, only to be reborn in the spring,
and also the squirrels start to starve,
right?
Wrong. As everyone knows, fall is
the best weather for walking animals
like dogs and children. What does
this mean? It means we can expect
to see more dogs and children on
leashes. Specifically, and in an alarm-
ing trend, we can expect to see more
men walking little dogs around Ann
Arbor. Has anyone else noticed this?
Does anyone find it odd and possibly
threatening in some way, besides the
Michigan Review?
Well, I don't feel threatened, exact-
ly. This is because the men have MOL-
ECULE-SIZED dogs. What's going on
here? Where are the Dobermans, the
German Shepherds, the Black Labs?
Was a Bichon Frise really intended

to be man's best friend and not, say,
something fun to feed to alligators?
I suppose I'm confused. Maybe
these guys just like little dogs. Or
maybe they're professional dog walk-
ers. Then again, maybe I'm going to
graduate with a job. The only realis-
tic conclusion that comes to mind is
that these men have created a new
strategy to meet women. Women love
a Bichon Frise, right? Women see a
Bichon Frise and say, "Wow! THAT
could go with my shoes," right? So
I getr at. But does havinga small
dog really make a guy more date-
able? Doesn't guiding a Papillon or
a Pekingese around and talking to
it affectionately give off some weird
vibes? Doesn't it seem to say, "I also
have an unmarked white van, not just
my littleLuluhere?"
There's also the sheer amount
of effort involved. Like most guys,
I didn't even know what a Bichon
Frise was before I started writing
this. It sounds like an entree, doesn't
it? (Actually, it's a white dog that's
approximately the size of a soccer
ball, only you can kick it further.) I
had to look itup on the Internetso you
think I know what I'm talking about.
(English majors: This is called adding
"ethos" to your writing.) I tend to do
this with most issues when their key
concepts elude me, which is why my
editors only let me write about cer-
tain things and fail to invite me to
parties. Anyway, if you're like me and
don't have a solid grasp of small dogs
in general, I'll save you some time. It's
safe to say that all small dogs either:
1. Look as though they've been
tossed ina dryer, or
2. Look as though they've been
tossed ina washing machine, or

3. Have no dog friends.
But let's get back to the effort of

be embarrassing.
Guy: Hi, I'm here for the - um
what's it called - Filet Mignon?
Breeder: You mean the Bichon
Frise?
Guy: Oh. That's it.
Real men don't buy
Dobermans. They,
buy Shih Tzus.
But who knows? Maybe small dogs
will be huge in a few years. Perhaps
in a short time, everyone will own
a small dog and large dogs will be
frowned upon and we'll be one step
closer to stopping global warming.
Perhaps the Chihuahua could be the
new symbol of masculinity. Maybe
in the near future when we turn on
the TV and a Wrangler Jeans com-
mercial comes on, it won't be guys'
playing football and enjoying one'
another's pants just a bit too much. It
will be guys walking their Shih Tzu's
and enjoying one another's pants just,
a bit too much, and we'll just have to
accept that.
In other, but not wholly unrelated,
news: Guys with small bikes who go
around doing stunts are still dumb.

DIANA FLORA |
The other side of Detroit

"This is an exciting time to be in Detroit,"
said Grace Lee Boggs, a 94-year-old activist.
"We're engaged in creating something new."
As I sat in the dimly-lit upstairs of the Boggs
Center, where many social justice activists had
sat before me, I looked to the other participants
of Semester in Detroit and saw women who
were as deeply moved and inspired by Grace's
words as I was.
This was April, and we had all spent the past
four months living, working and taking classes in
the city. Many of us had been challenged by the
harsh reality that Detroiters live with daily, but
beyond that, we had spent the past four months
having our preconceptions of Detroit shattered.
For this self-selecting group of liberal arts
students (and one arts student), the opportu-
nity to live in Detroit meant a variety of things.
For me, it was a way to connect with a city that
I was interested in on both an academic and
human level. After the program had finished,
we had collectively spent 3,000 hours volun-
teering for social service agencies, community
development corporations and community arts
organizations. I chose to work with Rashida
Tlaib (D-Detroit), the state House of Repre-
sentatives member for Southwest Detroit and
one of the few state legislators with an active
district office.
Largely because of my positive experience in
Semester in Detroit, I decided to take root in
the city after I graduated in May, and chose to
live in the district that I once served. Nestled
in the heart of southwest Detroit, I have more
daily interactions with my neighbors than I did
even in Ann Arbor. There's a community gar-
den two blocks from my house where I can go
pick a head of broccoli that I know was tended
to by neighbors and friends.
Though I'm still involved with Tlaib's office,
I now work as an AmeriCorps member for
Gleaners Community Food Bank on the east
side of the city. I set up nutrition education and
cooking classes for low-income folks in south-
east Michigan through a national program
called Operation Frontline. These classes are

facilitated by volunteer chefs and registered
dietitians who teach participants how to eat
healthily on a limited budget.
After living and working here for nine
months, I can't deny that there is some truth
to the media's negative portrayal of the city.
Violence and institutional corruption are pain-
ful realities that result from a history of racial
segregation and deindustrialization, which has
divided Detroit's population for more than a
century. This history is like a scar - physical
proof of the trauma the city has suffered and
yet evidence that there has been healing.
There is this Detroit, the one that people
fear, but the Detroit that interests me is the
one that is realistic about its own potential. I
see this in perspectives like those offered by
Boggs. These visionaries go beyond the idea of
"saving" the city. Rather, they recognize that
a complete restructuring is needed not only of
the city's infrastructure, but of what we think a
city is. Given Detroit's scars, revitalization will
necessarily be painfully critical and rational,
and people have already begun to think cre-
atively about it. This is the "something new"
that Boggs and many other Detroit residents
are engaged in.
I see a lot of hope in this kind of realistic
pragmatism. This is an exciting time to be liv-
ing in Detroit because the moment has come
for its re-imagining and restructuring. Detroit
residents have both the unique privilege and
the responsibility to engage themselves in this
revitalization. I'm happy to be part of this in
some way as a new resident of the city.
For those interested in learning more about
the program and our work in the city, come
to "Engaging Detroit - A Panel and Discus-
sion on Doing Community Work in Detroit" on
Wednesday, Sept. 23 from 7:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m.
in Dennison HAll, Room 110.

cations are due September 30. Get the applica-

As oversight specialist for People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Animals, I spend a lot of time pouring over records
pertaining to the abuse of animals in laboratories - labo-
ratory inspection reports filed by governmental agencies,
animal use protocols outlining graphic details of experi-
ments and veterinary records describing the day-to-day
lives of animals that have suffered painful and deadly
tests in university laboratories.
I am sometimes surprised when I speak with college
students and others who imagine that animals are no lon-
ger used to test cosmetics (they are), that it's illegal to use
dogs and cats in invasive or painful experiments (it's per-
fectly legal), that animals are retired to sanctuaries after
they've been used in laboratories (most animals either die
in the course of the experiment or are killed afterward)
and that every precaution is taken to minimize the suffer-
ing of animals (this is demonstrably false).
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. After all, experi-
ments conducted on animals are done out of public view,
and when animal experimenters do discuss their "work,"
they use euphemistic terms that mask the cruelty that
they inflict on animals.
More than 115 million animals - including 70,000 non-
human primates, 72,000 dogs, 22,000 cats and 236,000
rabbits - are used in U.S. laboratories every year. And
the treatment of these animals is abysmal. Studies from
2005 and 2009 reveal that SO to 60 percent of rats and
mice who are subjected to painful experiments in which
deep incisions are made in their abdomens, chests and
skulls receive no post-surgical analgesic pain relief. A
2003 Harvard study found that nearly 90 percent of mon-
keys caged in laboratories engaged in abnormal behaviors
indicative of extreme psychological distress, including
self-mutilation and repetitive, neurotic behaviors such as
circling madly or incessantly running from side to side in
their cage.
Virtually nothing is prohibited in animal laboratories,
no matter how redundant, pointless or cruel it is. Animals
have holes drilled into their skulls, their spinal cords sev-
ered to cause paralysis, their eyes sewn shut and their
skin burned off. Even when modern alternatives to ani-
mal use are available, experimenters are not required to
use them and most of the time they don't.
There is only one federal law in the U.S. - the Animal
Welfare Act of 1966 - that governs the treatment of ani-
mals in laboratories, although this law fails to cover mice,
rats, birds and fish, who account for at least 95 percent

of the animals used in laboratories. That said, according
to multiple federal audits, even this law - which deals
mainly with caging and husbandry issues and covers only
a tiny fraction of the animals used in experiments - isn't
adequately enforced. These audits have also found that
the animals' last line of defense - oversight commit-
tees at individual laboratories, called Institutional Anir-
mal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) - are failing at
their jobs, functioning as rubber-stamping committees in
which anything goes.
At the University, where 350,000 animals are used
each year, experimenters have addicted monkeys to every
drug under the sun, including cocaine, ecstasy, barbitu-
rates, methamphetamines, nicotine and alcohol. Rats and
mice have been used in studies of fear, anxiety, depression
and helplessness. One experimenter is using rats to study,
the benefits of green tea and another uses mice to study
the benefits of soy.
It's not just that the University's IACUC seems to be
happy to approve every scientifically fraudulent or cruel
protocol that crosses its desk. The University has also'
failed when it comes to basic, day-to-day animal care.
Mice in University laboratories have died of starvation,
and dehydration because people didn't notice that these.
animals had no food or water for days. In another instance,
cases of live mice were placed out with the trash, and thf
animals were crushed to death in a compactor.
In other instances, experimenters have conducted pro
cedures that had not been approved by the oversight com-'
mittee, causing animals immense pain and suffering. In'
fact, over a 6-month period from 2006 to 2007, the Uni-
versity violated federal animal protection regulations and'
guidelines more than 70 times.
Imprisoning and inflicting harm on other thinking,
feeling beings because they are weaker or look differ-,
ent, or because some people believe that our pain is more
important than theirs, is cruel and unethical. Students
deserve to know what happens inside the laboratories a
their school. I encourage all University students, staff and'
faculty to attend the "Testing ... One, Two, Three" forum'
today at 7 p.m. in Angell Hall, Auditorium B. People of all
opinions and backgrounds, particularly those who work
with animals or may work with animals in the future, are{
encouraged to attend.
Dr. Alka Chandna is a senior researcher with PETA. She,
will be speaking at the "Testing ... One, Two, Three" forum.

STEM CELLS
From Page 1A
"We very much want to find
a way to stop the progression of
ALS," Feldman said, "rather than
just slow it down."
The Investigational New
Drug application was submitted
to the FDA by Neuralstem Inc.,
a Maryland-based biotherapeu-
tics company that is sponsoring
the trial and providing all of the
neural stem cells used in the
treatments.
"They were doing a project
where they were using this stem
cell to treat spinal cord injuries,"
Feldman said. "The really sig-
nificant results clearly became
obvious to me that we should
strongly consider doing similar
work."
The first phase of the clini-
cal trials will assess the safety
of the treatment. Feldman and
her team will conduct the trials
at Emory University in Atlanta,
Ga., pending the approval of
Emory's Internal Review Board.
j Twelve ALS patients at vari-
ous stages of the disease will par-
tciipate in this phase of the initial
trial, which will allow for five to 1O
stem cell injections. Patients will
be examined at regular intervals,
aid a final report will be released
after approximately 24 months.
The FDA's approval of this trial
ftllows the downfall of some key
obstacles to stem cell research in
thte past year.
'Proposal 2 was met with con-
troversy by the citizens of Michi-
gan, passing narrowly with 51
percent of the vote. The passing
of the referendum allowed for an
amendment to the state's Consti-
tution drawing back restrictions
on stem cell research.
Last March, President Obama
reversed an executive order by
President Bush that restricted
the federal funding of stem cell
research.
Asthefirstclinicaltrialofastem
cell-derived treatment, Dr. Feld-
man's work could hold far-reach-
ing effects for the research and
treatments of other neurodegen-
erative disorders, like Alzheimer's
disease and multiple sclerosis.
- 'The potential role of this trial
to increase our understanding of
other neurodegenerative diseases
is actually quite high," Feldman
said. "However, we won't really
know until we see how stem cells
affect the brain."

CRIME
From Page lA
pital last night, Blackwell said.
After the third person was
stabbed, the fight evidently con-
tinued, Blackwell said. It is at that
point when the suspect with the
knife is believed to have "received
injuries to his face area, possibly a
broken nose," Blackwell said.
The clash ultimately was bro-
ken up, Blackwell said, "by the
bouncers and the police officers
who were right around the cor-
ner." The whole altercation is not
believed to have lasted very long at
all, Blackwell said.

The manager working at Good
Time Charley's at the time the
fight broke out would not com-
ment on the incident.
None of the people involved in
the fight are University students,
Blackwell said. He also said that he
did not know as of 3:45 a.m. yester-
day morning if any of the people
involved were AnnArbor residents.
The suspect with the knife was
taken into police custody, accord-
ing to Blackwell, and was set to be
arraigned yesterday. When con-
tacted today about the arraign-
ment charges, Blackwell said he
had no new information, but said
the AAPD recommended feloni-
ous assault.

Walk-on impact felt under Rodriguez

By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
Daily Sports Editor
Rich Rodriguez remembers
exactly where he was when he
heard the news. He was an incom-
ing sophomore at West Virginia,
stretching at two-a-day camp two
weeks before his football team's
opening game against Oklahoma,
when Mountaineer coach Don
Nehlen called him over.
"He said, 'You can tell your
mom and dad that I'm going to
give you a scholarship, but it's only

have to earn it again next year.' I
said, 'That's good, Coach, I'll be all
right,' "Rodriguez recalled. "But I
can remember it like yesterday."
Current Wolverine redshirt
sophomore Kevin Leach's story is
almost identical to Rodriguez's -
and just as poignant. About two
weeks before this year's opening
game against Western Michigan,
Leach was lifting in the Michi-
gan weight room when Rodri-
guez called the linebacker into his
office to tell him he had earned a
scholarship for the 2009 season.
Leach immediately called his
father, Mike, who put the phone
on speakerphone so his whole
family could hear the news at the
same time.
Redshirt junior wide receiver
Jon Conover's scholarship was a
long time coming. He had already
earned two varsity letters and
played in 18 games before the start
of the 2009 season, mainly on spe-
cial teams. As the team's seniors
were about to leave this year's
end-of-camp senior dinner, which
was held at Rodriguez's home in
Saline, the coach asked Conover to
hang back. After three years, Con-
over received a scholarship and a
hug from his coach.
Both Leach and redshirt junior
Jon Conover had similar begin-
nings - they attended Catholic
Central High School (Leach in
Grand Rapids, Conover in Detroit)
and came to Michiganas preferred
walk-ons. Both have difficult
majors - Leach is a mechanical
engineering major and Conover

In last Saturday's 45-17 win
against the Eagles, Leach started
at linebacker after usual starter
Jonas Mouton was suspended by
the Big Ten for one game. Leach
finished with a team-high 10
tackles.
Though Leach's start was a sur-
prise to many, it shouldn't have
been - he is listed second on the
official depth chart at the posi-
tion, behind Mouton but in front
of rivals.com four-star recruit
and redshirt freshman Brandon
Smith.
"If the walk-on's good enough
to play, then he'll play, and man,
that's huge," Leach's father, Mike,
said. "Whether he was a walk-
on or the first guy they signed on
Signing Day, it didn't matter. That
says a lot. It says a lot about Rodri-
guez's character and the way he
runs his team, just a message of
fairness like that."
Since Leach was a "school-
start" walk-on, he didn't partici-
pate in spring or summer practices
with the rest of the team before
coming to Ann Arbor in the fall of
2007. He made friends with a few
of the scholarship players early,
after getting to know them while
regularly giving them rides home
after football practice, but Mike
Leach said it wasn't until two-
thirds of the way through Leach's
freshman season before he felt
like "one of the guys" on the team.

The Michigan field hockey team celebrates after a goal in Michigan's win over Stanford last September.
Field hockey coach returns to A2
with NCAA Championship as goal

By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
Two Olympic appearances.
It soundslike an accomplishment
most athletes would dream about,
but it was Michigan field hockey
coach Marcia Pankratz's reality.
Pankratz was a Big Ten field
hockey player at Iowa before play-
ing in two Olympic games in 1988
and 1996. She went on to coach the
Wolverines from 1996 to 2004.
Then, she left to start her own
company, which she has since run
successfully.
"It's always fun to take on new
challenges and kind of push your-
self outside your comfort zone,"
Pankratz said. "You only get to live
once. ... I'm a bit of a risk taker."
After a four-year hiatus at Four
Goals, the consulting business she
founded to help high school ath-
letes with the recruiting process,
Pankratz ached to be back coach-
ing and teaching student-athletes.
Before this season, Pankratz
hired an associate to run the busi-
ness for her because she could no
longer stay away from Ann Arbor.
She returned to coach at Phyl-
lis Ocker Field in January after
former head coach Nancy Cox
resigned. Back at the helm of the
Michigan field hockey program,
Pankratz hopes to help the Wol-
verines win their second NCAA
Championship in school history.
In 2001, during Pankratz's first
coaching stint at Michigan, the
field hockey team picked up the
first NCAA title for any female
sport at Michigan.
"I remember when I used to be
the assistant at North Carolina
years and years ago, back in the
early 90's, we were talking about
coaching," Pankratz said. "I said
the only coaching job I would e r

look at would be the University of
Michigan.
"It's a phenomenal institution
and has great potential to be a
national power, and I'd like tobe a
part of that and to be back in the Big
Ten where I was a student-athlete."
When Pankratz got the call that
the job was open, she packed up as
soon as the 1996 Olympic games
were over, left Atlanta and headed
to Ann Arbor, where she earned a
reputation to expect the best from
her players at all times.
"Marcia brings a certain
level of intensity to practice and
games, and she's a little bit more
outspoken," former Wolverine
and current assistant coach Kristi
Gannon Fisher said.
A natural athlete, Pankratz
played ice hockey until high
school, when the closest equiva-
lent they offered for girls was
field hockey.
"I found out who the best team
in the country was," Pankratz
said. "So I called up (Iowa) and
went outthere. I loved the Big Ten
atmosphere and how they treated
the student-athletes."
And that was that. Pankratz
played at Iowa for four years
before making her two Olympic
appearances, and she was induct-
ed into the U.S. Field Hockey
Association Hall of Fame in 2004.
The same year, she left Ann Arbor
to start Four Goals.
The Wolverines turned their
record upside down the first time
Pankratz arrived in Ann Arbor.
They were 7-11 in Pankratz's first
year in 1996 but won their first
Big Ten title in 1997, got an NCAA
tournament bid in 1999 and won
the NCAA title two years later.
For Pankratz, the success was
more of an expectation than a
surprise.

"I think all of the young
women, including the team that's
here now, came here because they
want to be a leader, they want to
be the best," Pankratz said. "They
want tobe champions."
But this year's team (2-6) is off
to a less-than-exceptional start,
and with the Big Ten opener this
weekend, they are hoping to fit
the pieces together and perform.
Pankratz isn't concerned though.
She welcomes failure - what she
calls "new paths on your journey"
- and claims it is a contributing
factor to where she is today.
"It's okay sometimes to all of a
sudden have some bumps in the
road because it helps focus you in
the direction you want to go in,"
Pankratz said. "You learn a lot
from it.
"Especially when you are
coaching a team and you lose a
game. You are going to learn a lot
from not winning the game. So
that makes you better."
Gannon Fisher recalls the 2001
season leading up to the champi-
onship.
"We weren't expected to win,
by any means," Fisher said. "We
won because we had a great team
and not just great players on the
team.We allalways have (the 2001
title) in ourback pocket as a great
experience and something that
we use every day in our lives."
Luckily for everyone involved,
Pankratz has set high standards
for this year's team while simulta-
neously embracing adversity. She
brings a level of intensity through
her vocalization and expectations
of the girls that, in the past, has
brought them a championship.
"That's why we are here,"
Pankratz said. "We are trying to
bring another national champion-
ship back t Michigan."

A cold United States welcome

ext spring, I graduate and
leave Ann Arbor for good.
Even with still two semes-
ters to go, I am already feeling
myself terribly nostalgic at the
prospect of bidding farewell to
the only place in this country I've
called home.
But when I first arrived on cam-
pus, I was less inclined to label
Ann Arbor the best college town
in the world. At the beginning of
freshman year, I saw the campus
as a collection of unappealing,
brick academic buildings dotting a
largely barren countryside. And in
this unwelcoming dystopia, people
rarely talked - they only nodded
soundlessly in recognition. Who
would have blamed me for see-
ing that? I was, after all, an inter-
national student who had, upon
arriving to Ann Arbor, been mer-
cilessly placed in the sedate, outer-
most edge of campus - Baits I.
On one of my first days on cam-
pus, I watched a deer outside my
residence hall search despon-
dently for food. It was an unsuc-
cessful attempt, of course, for
Baits housed no dining facility.

On a casual foray near the shrub-
bery outside the building, I found
an odd-smelling sofa and squirrels
large enough to devour the deer. A
drunken, haggard man lay uncon-
scious by a walking path. Where
- and how else - could I have cre-
ated a preconceived general image
of Ann Arbor that was farther
from the truth?
Fortunately, a lifetime's expo-
sure to cable television in Pakistan
had me sufficiently well versed in
American pop culture to stop me
from applying generalizations to a
city I had only partly experienced.
So I remained cautiously optimis-
tic, convinced that I would soon
witness America in all its quintes-
sential Rambo-esque glory.
Not even an earlier encounter
with a brusque immigration officer
at Chicago airport had dampened
my excitement or euphoria. After
requesting passengers holding
Pakistani and United Arab Emir-
ates passports to step aside, the
officer proceeded to make us wait
three hours until our names were
called out in ominous tones. The
subsequent interview had been

straightforward. Until, of course,
we got to a harder question: what
color was my hair? "Black," I had
answered coolly. "No, it isn't," he
replied angrily. "It's dark brown."
Then he needlessly reprimanded
Why my first
months in Ann
Arbor were
difficult
me for my flippant outlook on life
as I stood bewildered and per-
plexed before a scared South Asian
student audience.
Still, it seemed the University
was determined to test how much
my optimistic patience would
endure. Following University pro-
cedure, first-year international
students had to register in the
final weeks of August, later than
all other freshmen. Caught in the

urgency of simultaneously pick-
ing classes and figuring out how to
use Wolverine Access and CTools,
I found myself with a class sched-
ule that required four hours of
travel time shuttling back and forth
between Baits and the corridors of
Angell Hall.
On my first day of classes, with
my head still spinning from orien-
tation lessons and tentative class
schedules, I waltzed absentmind-
edly onto a bus when I was ready
to return to North Campus. Instead
of being conveniently deposited at
the Baits bus stop, I found myself
looking at scenery I had never seen
before, realizing far too late I had
taken the wrong bus and ended up
near the Northwood apartment
complex.
Sadly, that wasn't my last
exhausting bus ride. Later that
year, the state of Michigan, eager
to contribute to the international
student's freshman-year obstacle
course, decided to impose a blan-
ket ban preventing temporary
residents from acquiring driver's
licenses. Limited to travel itiner-
aries that depended on Amtrak

and Greyhound routes, I spent fall
break touring Midwestern cities
like Grand Rapids, Cleveland and
Toledo. But unfortunately, I wasted
much of the time waiting at Grey-
hound stops in Jackson, Mich., Gary,
Ind., and a host of other cities with
names that would be more appro-
priate in a University yearbook.
Luckily, first appearances can be
deceiving. Infollowingyears, I man-
aged to erase lingering memories of
monotonous bus rides, immigra-
tion waiting rooms and needless
detours to Detroit and develop a
thorough appreciation of the city.
Now, from the heart of Central
Campus - driver's license in hand
and officially brown-haired - I
find myself in my senior year at
the University. But it was only
after successfully maneuvering an
obstacle course - that may well
have skewed perceptions, for me
or any other international student,
the other way - that I learned to
make the most of my foreign expe-
rience.

The real-life application of medical marijuana
From page 5B

Right now, Joe has 12 plants in
a small grow room that he is pre-
venting from flowering by keeping
them in 22.5 hours of light a day.
He is working on finishing a larger
grow room with the help of some
younger friends, who often come
over to work on projects in Joe's
loft and mechanic shop. When he
moves the plants into the main
room later, he will change their
lighting schedule to 12 hours of
light so they will flower.
"See how tall that ceiling is?" he
said. "We're going to make them
big."
Joe hopes to convince his doc-
tor that marijuana can be benefi-
cial if managed in a safe way. If the
doctor still won't see the value in
medical marijuana, Joe said he
will find another who has learned
about the treatment.
"How can you make a decision

about something you haven't stud-
ied or been to a seminar on?" Joe
said. "I would rather have a doctor
who's trained in the treatment of
leukemia than a doctor who (has)
just heard of the treatment of leu-
kemia."
Joe is used to figuring things
out for himself. It's what he prid-
ed himself on during his 18-year
career as a Dodge mechanic, and
it's what he prides himself on now
as a cancer patient who is making
the most of his remaining years.
"You tell me I can't do some-
thing, I'm going to ask you why
and I'm going to figure out a way I
can do it," Joe said.
Joe's home in Ionia is a testi-
mony to his determination and
indomitable spirit. After he was
diagnosed, Joe moved to be with
his mother on a large plot of land
his niece inherited. With his

mother in the house, Joe decided
to turn a barn loft on the property
into a makeshift apartment. The
loft has no glass windows, and the
only heating is a radiation system
in the walls and concrete floors.
It is not the type of living situ-
ation you would expect for a leu-
kemia patient who has lived much
longer than expected in blast cell
crisis. But Joe has more plans for
the place. Along with the grow
room, Joe is currently adding a
master bedroom and bathroom.
Originally a car mechanic,
Joe has made himself a jack-of-
all-trades through researching
building and growing techniques
online. In that way, Joe is a model
for all of the state's medical mari-
juana patients who, in the absence
of a state-run dispensary system,
have had to engineer their own
way to get medicated.

Pandemic
paranoia
Campus life during swine
flu hysteria
Kleenex - check. Hand sani-
tizer - check. Molded surgical
masks? Check. This year, with the
introduction of a new strain of
flu - H1N1, dubbed swine flu -
in addition to the run-of-the mill
seasonal flu, University health offi-
cials are fighting infection in more
creative ways.
Swine flu mania is upon us, and
there isn't a place you can go on
campus that won't remind you of
that. First, there was the e-mail
from Provost Teresa Sullivan,
instructing fever-ridden students
to stay quarantined for 24 hours
after the fever broke. (The e-mail
also provided a get-out-of-class-
free card for anyone bold enough
to fib about having the flu.) Now,
every bulletin board seems to fea-
ture this cute reminder of flu safe-
ty: "Coughs and sneezes spread
diseases!"
But the University is also doing
some innovative things behind the
scenes to battle the flu. A "flu bus",
for example, will transport two
sick students at a time from resi-
dence halls to University Health
Services.
The University's All Hazard
Planning Group-a group of about
50 individuals from various Uni-
versity departments- is respon-
sible for such initiatives. After the
avian flu scare a few years ago, the
group has been working behind
the scenes to combat any pandemic
that might threaten campus.
Amid the flu craze, UHS is a

beacon for ill students. In the
clinic, signs give tips for avoiding
the transmission of flu and urge
visitors with flu symptoms (fever,
sore throat, cough, headache, body
aches) to put on surgical masks.
But UHS hasn't been able to pro-
vide much more than helpful tips
to some students - since the flu
mania began, walk-in appoint-
ments have sometimes been harder
to get into than Rick's on a Satur-
day night.
At around 4 p.m. last Friday, a
half hour before the clinic closed,
all the waiting rooms were occu-
pied with people wearing surgi-
cal masks. The sign that hung
above the appointment check-in
desk displaying the wait time for
a walk-in appointment simply read
"OVERBOOK."
Aniuska Rovaina, a Public Pol-
icy junior, made an appointment
at UHS that day on account of her
roommate's weariness over her
recentcough and congestion symp-
toms. Although she respected her
roommate's concern over catch-
ing the flu, Rovaina said she thinks
there's too much hype about being
safe this flu season.
"I think that kids are thinking
way too much about (contracting
the flu) when it's not that big of a
deal," she said.
But according to Robert Win-
field, the University's chief health
officer, these safety measures are
necessary during such an aggres-
sive flu season such as this one. *
"It's very uncommon for us to
see this," Winfield said.
About 15 years ago, Winfield
said that there was an outbreak
of flu that overwhelmed Univer-
sity Health Services for about two
weeks - an amount of cases close

. Other universities are experi-
encing even more aggressive flu
outbreaks. At Cornell University,
one student died on Sept. 11 due
to complications with H1N1. The
number of Cornell students diag-
nosed as probable H1N1 cases
amounted to over 550, The Cornell
Daily Sun reported Sept. 14.
Cornell's Greek scene has put the
kibosh on germ-swapping social
activities like beer pong tourna-
ments and massive house parties.
The Interfraternity Council voted
to place a moratorium on social
events for an undefined amount of
time because of severe outbreak,
the Sun reported.
So with an increasing amount of
flu cases and extreme surges of the
virus on other campuses, should
students be really worried?
Winfield doesn't think so. He
said that last Friday, UHS saw 16
people with flu-like symptoms,
which is a decrease of about 20-30
people per day.
He cited three possible reasons
for the decrease: the outbreak
could be winding.down, students
who caught it at the Sept. 12 foot-
ball game are overcoming the virus
or students are going home when
they feel sick and not checking into
UHS.
Despite the heightened aware-
ness of flu on campus, Winfield
said he believes that most students
are not letting themselves get too
worked up.
"I think that students are han-
dling this well," he said. "We've
had occasional students that are
very frightened, occasional par-
ents that are very worried, but I
think overall, people are being
very sensible."

to what he is currently seeing.
On a typical day, UHS sees about
40 to 50 people who are possi-
bly infected with H1N1. Just two
weeks ago, UHS only saw 50 peo-
ple who reported to have flu-like
symptoms. Last week, UHS treated
190 people.
Although the University is no
longer testing patients for the flu,

UHS is a surveillance site for a
study within the School of Pub-
lic Health that submits five to 10
anonymous specimens a day to
a laboratory to be tested for flu.
Based on these studies, it's evident
that there are people on this cam-
pus who are infgcted with HIN.
So there's a real chance your room-
mate isn't just being dramatic.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK
just saw that stick "There is an inherent feeling
going through her neck among many in this country
and I knew I needed to that an African-American
get help quick." should not be president."

Looming on Washtenaw Ave-
nue, surrounded by quaint
homes, is a cavernous, Swiss
chalet-style mansion that might, on
a dark night, fill a passerby with a
sense of dread.
If you were to guess the build-
ing's purpose, you might think
it was the headquarters of some
clandestine, powerful society-- or
Ann Arbor's own haunted man-
sion. But the story behind the thick
fieldstone and menagerie of shrub-
bery is really nothing so lurid. The
mansion is the Vitosha Guest Haus
Inn, the city's most interesting
hotel.
This imposing stone fortress is
home to the Vitosha Guest Haus,
as well as owner Kei Constantinov
and family. Located just west of
fraternity row, Vitosha is named
for Constantinov's ancestral con-
nections to Bulgaria.
Greeted by Constantinov - and,
most likely, her gigantic, snaggle-
toothed Mastiff-mix named
George - a visitor to the bed and.
breakfast is immediately dazzled
by the strange, elaborate interior.
Exposed ceiling beams combine
with dark slate flooring to invoke
a rustic but sophisticated lodge in
the European countryside.
From a close examination of the
decor, it is clear that Constantinov
.. - has thought about every detail: the
Victorian literature 'lghe, book-
case, the Holtkamp pipe organ in
the hall and the period furniture
in every room. Even Constantinov
herself adds to the ambience -
with her rich dark red hair pulled
into two braided buns, she com-
poses herself like the grand dame
of a manor frozen in time.
Constantinov's fantasy time
warp was years in the making.
A former art teacher from Indi-
ana, Constantinov purchased the
manor 11 years ago after her hus-

band was transferred from a New
York art firm.
The 32-room inn has a rich his-
tory dating back to 1917, when it
was the home of Dean Meyer, a
professor at the University's medi-
cal school and Ann Arbor City
Council member. Before the Con-
stantinovs, a Unitarian church
had used the property for services
and office space, adding a chapel,
parsonage and a few outhouses.
George Brigham, a modernist
architect who taught at the Uni-
versity, designed the Unitarian
sanctuary in 1956. And according
to the Ann Arbor Historical Dis-
trict Commission, famed archi-
tect Frank Lloyd Wright praised
Brigham's work.
But despite prestigious acclaim,
Constantinov said the manor was
a far cry from the living dollhouse
it is today when she bought it. The
Unitarians had left many of the
interior rooms as plain as hospital
rooms.
"When we purchased the place,
the big house had been used as
an office by the Unitarians and it
seemed like the entire interior had
been spray-painted white," Con-
stantinov said. "And there were
absolutely no gardens around the
place. It looked very stark."
Constantinov renovated anTl
landscaped the property for years
before opening for business. After
her English roses had flourished
and each room had been exquisite-
ly furnished, Constantinov set her-
self to creating an unforgettable
experience for her guests. Visitors
are treated to a china-laden break-
fast and, if they come at the right
time, a variety of entertainment.
"When guests come, I see they
are immediately able to relax and
sink it to their surroundings here,"
Constantinov said. "It's really
about details and finding the time

to establish these details that
makes this place unique."
Norbert Klusen, a visiting pro-
fessor from the University of
Hanover in Germany, sat with his,
13-year-old daughter in the con--l
cert hall listening to the 1930s
jazz stylings of Stolen Sweets. As
is commonly the case with visitors
to Vitosha Guest Haus, Klusen had
chosen to stay there on the recom-
mendation of his University con-
tact. He was very happy that he
had done so.
"I've been about 30 different
states and this place definitely has
a more European feel than many
places we've stayed," Klusen said.
"Immediately when I walked in, it
reminded me of a Scottish or Eng-
lish place."
Constantinovs concert hall will
be busy this year, with a new con-
cert series hitting the stage featur-
ing acts from the former Firefly
Jazz Club.
"Much of the music featured is
along the lines of jazz, classical,
and indie folk music," she said.
Tickets are sold prior to each per-
formance.
But Constantinov's vision for
Vitosha Guest Haus doesn't stop
at a bed and breakfast with occa-
sional entertainment. She wants
to expand into the art world, mak-
ing Vitosha a "cultural center with
lodging."
Right now, she is currently
accepting residency applications
from artists who would live at the
inn for extended period, teaching
workshops, exhibiting work and
participating in panel discussions.
Constantinov's plan to make
Vitosha Guest Haus the creative
hub of Ann Arbor is right in line
with the character of the magnifi-
cent house, which has been a piece
of art at every point in its long,
winding history.

YOUTUBE
VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
YouTube's greatest
Since YouTube launched in Febru-
ary 2005, there have been hundreds
of epic videos that have attracted
millions of viewers on the web. This
video does a great service forYou-
Tube fanatics by compiling all those
hits into one hilarious video.
Titled "100 Greatest Hits of You-
tube in 4 Minutes," this video serves
as a concise and entertaining sum-
mary of some of Youtube's highlights,
many of which have individually
received more than a million views.
The video is set to a song that's a
heady mix of rap and techno, with
the bass thumping in the background
and the clips quickly cycling through
one after another.
This reel of clips combines incred-
ible feats with catastrophic (and pain-
ful) failures. Itincludesseveralpeople
wiping out on treadmills, dirt bikes,
and diving boards, while one man
does a backflip and lands into a pair
of pants being held up by his friends.
A significant portion of this video is
devoted to the baby clips that have
been wildly popular, including the
one about Charlie biting his brother's
thumb, the one with the baby who
laughs nonstop, and the one with the
child who repeatedly says, "blood." In
addition, the video features the hilar-
ious clip of Leroy Jenkins, the crazed
videogamer, screaming his own name
as he engages in virtual combat.

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
CiderFest - It's official: autumn has finally arrived.
To celebrate the start of the season, you should host
a hard apple-cider party with all your friends. You
can either buy your beverages or, if you're feeling
ambitious, you can make your own with fresh apples
from one of the nearby orchards. Either way, there
are three critical components to this party: lots of
cider, some argyle sweaters and a bonfire. Playing
the board game Apples to Apples is optional.
Throwing this party? Let us know. TheStatement@umich.edu
STUDY OF THE WEEK
Frugal people are more likely to marry spendthrifts
People who are frugal with their money often tend to marry those
who spend more liberally, a difference that often creates marital ten-
sion, according to a study published by Scott Rick, an assistant profes-
sor of marketing at the Ross School of Business.
In the study, Rick and researchers from the University of Pennsyl-
vania and Northwestern University conducted three different stud-
ies in which they surveyed more than 1,000 married and unmarried
adults. The researchers were looking at whether sentiments about
spending can indicate people's marital preferences, as well as wheth-
er differences in views on spending affect the health of a marriage.
The researchers concluded that both tightwads and spendthrifts
are dissatisfied with their own feelings about spending money, and
this discontent often motivates them to seek out people with opposite
spending habits. In addition, the researchers noted that this diver-
gence in fiscal views tends to produce tension in a marriage.

-

n the afternoon of Aug. 11, Domin-
ick's was as bustling as could be
expected on a sunny summer's day.
With barely a table available on the back
patio, the tin of friendly chatter and the
tinkling of sangria-filled jars created a
lighthearted atmosphere. But tucked
away in the far back, a much more seri-
ous conversation was going on. There,
people from all walks of life had come
together to discuss their one unifying
factor: the desire to treat themselves or
others with medical marijuana.
While from the outside seeming like
a casual gathering like any other taking
place on the patio, this meeting of the
Michigan Marijuana Patient Collective
was anything but carefree. Nearly all of
the 30 or so participants suffered from
a debilitating condition, from leukemia
to chronic migraines. Some people were
so ill they said they barely leave their
homes except for doctor appointments.
But for registered patients, such meet-
ings are one of the only available means
to figure out how to get marijuana.
Michigan took a progressive step
when voters approved the Michigan
Compassionate Care Initiative last
November. But in some crucial ways,
the program is out of touch with needs
of the patients it serves. Michigan isn't
alone - out of the 13 states that admin-
ister medical marijuana programs, only
California provides a means for dispens-
ing to patients through cannabis phar-
macies. Dennis Hayes, an Ann Arbor
lawyer who specializes in drug law, said
that states declined to operate dispensa-
ry systems to avoid being direct suppli-
ers in the face of federal laws prohibiting
marijuana.
"One of the problems is that the state
can't encourage people to act collective-
ly," Hayes said. "The reason is no state
can publicly endorse breaking a federal
law."
But chances that the War on Drugs
will heat back up and target medical
marijuana are slim to none. Following
California's example, states could - and
many people say, should - provide guid-
ance for marijuana patients who, by vir-
tue of being approved for the program,
have serious conditions that make extra
help all the more valuable.
As it stands right now, the Michigan

Medical Marijuana Program presents
a catch-22 for patients: You can smoke
weed, but it's up to you to figure out how.
Vague regulations governing the pro-
gram also induce anxiety for patients
who are afraid that in trying to get their
medicine, they'll run afoul of state drug
laws.
EELING LIKE A CRIMINAL
Even though marijuana is now legal
for thousands of people in Michigan,
registered patients are still skittish
about speaking outright about it. All
patients and caregivers interviewed for
this story asked that their full names not
be printed so as not to draw attention to
their activities.
Several people talked about how
smoking marijuana still feels illicit even
with a registered patient card in pocket.
The same people who passed around lit
pipes at the Dominick's meeting were
unwilling to be identified as marijuana
smokers to the outside world. Some cited
the stigma attached to the vilified sub-
stance.
"We're from the Reagan Drug War
era," a patient named Kirk said. "This is
crazy."
But besides a residual feeling of guilt
surrounding marijuana, there are other
more tangible threats dogging patients
and caregivers. The Michigan Medi-
cal Marijuana Program has only been
operational since April, which means
the nuances of the law are not yet well
known by both patients and law enforc-
ers. A patient couple in Madison Heights
ranintotrouble in March whenthe police
raided their house and confiscated 21
plants, The Detroit News reported. The
two had been approved by a physician
as patients but were waiting to receive
their cards in the mail. A judge later dis-
missed the charges and derided the new
marijuana law for its lack of clarity, say-
ing it was the "worst piece of legislation
(he) has ever seen in (his) life."
The problem comes down to the law's
guidelines, which initially seem clear
but become confusing when applied to
the transfer of marijuana from caregiver
to patient. The law stipulates that a care-
giver may possess up to 2.5 ounces of
usable marijuana and 12 plants for each
of up to five patients. A patient who has

authorized a caregiver to grow mari-
juana may possess 2.5 ounces of usable
product. But does that mean that 5 ounc-
es can be held in the name of one patient,
or just 2.5?
It may seem like splitting hairs, but
patients feel like they need to be as care-
ful as possible. They do live in a state
that has a long history of throwing the
book at marijuana offenders. Ann Arbor
lawyer Dennis Hayes knows just how
bent against marijuana the courts can
be. Hayes has worked on drug law since
1972, when he helped create Ann Arbor's
infamous pot law - which instituted a
small fine as the maximum punishment
for marijuana possession in the city. He
represented defendants in drug cases
until the '90s, when he stopped taking
those cases out of frustration toward the
war on drugs.
But as soon as Hayes heard about
the campaign to put medical marijuana
on the 2008 ballot, he came back to the
cause. The tide had turned for medical
marijuana in Michigan, he said. Unlike
less organized attempts to put it on the
ballot, last year's movement had better
leadership and wider support.
"It was very clear when I saw what
was going on with this one that these
people had it together," Hayes said.
The medical marijuana law began as
a grassroots effort, and deciding how
the program will operate has also been
a community affair. Before the medical
marijuana program began, Hayes and
many other advocates attended public
hearings regarding proposed regulation
guidelines. Advocates shut down plans
to record the actions of caregivers and
patients to an extent that could threaten
privacy or incriminate them in the case
of a federal investigation.
"They first proposed that there be
detailed inventories of who got what
pot, when, from whom - very, very
detailed tracking," Hayes said. "I guess
the threshold issue here is that the
state strongly opposed this leg to begin
with."
COMMUNITY IN LIEU OF
PHAR7MACIES
Michigan might not know how to
treat marijuana users as anything but
criminals. Since the state offers little

assistance in obtaining medical mari-
juana, a network of community support
groups has helped patients get their
needed drug.
The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation,
a marijuana advocacy group stationed
in eight medical marijuana states, has
already set up four clinics in Michigan
designed to examine patients and issue
recommendations for medical marijuana
cards. The foundation not only educates
patients about the effects of medical
marijuana, but also advocates the legal-
ization of marijuana for recreational and
industrial use.
Organizations like the Michigan
Medical Marijuana Association main-
tain websites with articles and forums
to educate patients and caregivers. The
Ann Arbor-based Association of Medi-
cal Marijuana Caregivers is currently
establishing a database that will locate
available caregivers within a certaingeo-
graphical area. The locator tool doesn't
yet yield results, but the volunteer effort
to help patients shows a system that is,
in fact, rooted in compassion.
"When you have someone who is
chronically ill, you need to make it easy
on them, not hard, to find their medica-
tion," said Jacqueline Cooke, who vol-
unteers for the Association of Medical
Marijuana Caregivers. "You see a lot of
blogs and a lot of forums with patients
who just have these questions. Your
heart just sort of goes out to them. It's

just so difficult and it shouldn't be dif-
ficult because it's legal."
Hayes, the Ann Arbor lawyer, is also
the co-founder of the Medical Marijua-
na Patient Collective. He said he formed
the group to help patients and caregiv-
ers find each other, learn about growing
techniques and compare experiences.
For patients who were never recreation-
al smokers, medical marijuana commu-
nity meetings are invaluable in figuring
out how to attain their medicine.
At the Dominick's meeting in August,
patients seemed split between people
who had been already using marijuana
to treat their pain previous to the ini-
tiative and people who are just trying it
now.
One marijuana convert at the meet-
ing was a professor at Eastern Michigan
University, who asked to remain anony-
mous to protect her reputation at work.
Suffering from glaucoma, back pain and
chronic headaches, the professor had
been taking so much morphine that it
interfered with her teaching.
"It was such heavy doses," she said.
"It just makes you sick. What would I do
if I even had more pain?"
The professor had never smoked
marijuana except once in high school,
but when a friend suggested she try
marijuana, she found it suited her much
better than the morphine. After being
approved as a patient, she was able to
find a caregiver at a patient meeting who

would grow and harvest marijuana for
her.
Her caregiver, Brenda from Man-
chester, Mich., was also at the Aug. 11
meeting. Sitting with her fiance Randy,
a registered patient she also grows for,
Brenda was on the lookout for prospec-
tive patients. As a caregiver for both
Randy and the EMU professor, Brenda
can legally serve three more patients,
which would allow her to grow 60 plants
in total. She said she is considering mak-
ing her caregiver service a full-time job.
"The more and more people that I
meet, the more that appeals to me," she
said.
PORTR AIT OF A PATIENT
Among the networking patients and
caregivers on the Dominick's patio was
Joe, a leukemia patient at the Univer-
sity Hospital. Joe was different from
the others from the meeting. He wasn't
trying to find a caregiver - he had been
doing that for himself for years. He
wasn't looking to become a caregiver. In
fact, he hasn't even become a registered
patient yet.
Even though he has an obvious quali-
fying condition, Joe hasn't applied for
a card because he has been waiting to
have a consultation with his main doc-
tor at the University Hospital to get his
approval.
Earlier in the year, his doctor had been
concerned about Joe smoking marijuana

and inhaling chemicals on the buds. As a
substitute, Joe was prescribed Marinol,
which is a synthetic cannabinoid meant
to mimic the effects of marijuana. But
Joe said the drug was less effective and
took longer to work - "I was going bon-
kers," he said.
Since being diagnosed with cancer
in 2002, Joe has realized the place for
medical marijuana in his pain manage-
ment system. At first, he said, he turned
to marijuana for the first time in years to
deal with his feelings about his diagno-
sis. But he soon learned that marijuana
can't be used to avoid your problems.
"You'll box it up and box it up, and
sooner or later, your box is full and you
have to deal with," he said. "It doesn't
work. I've tried."
Joe now uses marijuana for moderate
daily pain that doesn't require some-
thing as heavy as morphine. It helps
him overcome nausea, develop an appe-
tite and get on with his life. For a can-
cer patient as active as Joe, the ability
to lessen pain without getting bogged
down by heavy-duty pain killers makes
for a more fulfilling life.
That is why he is working on a project
that he hopes will placate his doctor's
concerns about street-bought marijua-
na while keeping his medicine always
at hand: his own organic hydroponics
grow room.
