ADMISSIONS
Increased
number
of early
applicants

Nearly 25,000
students apply for
early action
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
By Christmas, thousands of
Wolverine hopefuls across the
nation had feverishly checked.
their inboxes, waiting for the
block-'M'-headed e-mail that
would relieve weeks of sweaty
palms, restless nights and an
obsession with hitting "refresh"
on their browsers.
As of Dec. 24, the University's
Office of Undergraduate Admis-
sions finished releasing about
22,000 decisions on early action
applications, a number up 3,000
from last year. With an increase
in applicants, an acceptance let-
ter was tougher to obtain.
While some students opened
e-mails congratulating them on
their acceptance to the Universi-
ty's class of 2017, others scanned
theirpages to find the less-than-
hoped-for response.
The deferral letter reads:
"Given our surging application
volume and very strong creden-
tials of our applicants, admission
to the University is becoming
increasingly competitive. As a
result, your application has been
deferred for a final decision until
a later date."
Some applicants also received
letters of denial, though deferrals
are more common.

Although the University has
not yet released precise data on
the number of deferred students
or the demographics of those
accepted, Erica Sanders, Office
of Undergraduate Admissions
managing director, wrote in an
e-mail interview that, "... any
increase we may see in Early
Action deferred decisions would
be due to stronger qualifications
among this year's early applicant
pool."
Even with an increase in appli-
cations, Sanders wrote that each
application received the stan-
dard "holistic" evaluation and
was reviewed multiple times.
"The quality of the applicant
pool remains strong even with
the increase in applications,
making our decisions even more
difficult," Sanders wrote.
And while the University
granted hundreds of extensions
to prospective students affected
by Hurricane Sandy in late Octo-
ber, Sanderssaidherstaffworked
tirelessly to meet the decision
deadlines for all applicants. No
geographic or high school order
is used, and it takes several days
to send out all the decisions.
She added that decisions are
only released once all applica-
tions have been processed.
"Our only concern in the
release of decisions is to ensure
accurate decisions are released
without causing the system to
crash due to the size of the file,"
Sanders wrote.
Despite the added pressure

Jason Daida, an associate
research scientist and lec-
turer at the University, died
Wednesday night after a battle
with cancer. He was 53.
Daida was an instructor
for Engineering 100 and 101
courses, and was also a fre-
quent visiting faculty member
at the University's Shanghai
Jiao Tong University joint
institute. in China, where he
also taught first-year engi-
neering courses.
He is survived by his wife,
Sandy, and his three children.
Engineering Prof. James
Holloway sent an e-mail on
Thursday morning to Engi-
neering undergraduates
announcing Daida's death and

expressing sympathy to stu-
dents and faculty.
"He will be'sorely missed by
colleagues, students and staff
in the College, across the Uni-
versity and at SJTU," he wrote.
"Jason's loss is tragic, but he
had such a positive impact on
so many, that truly his life was
blessed."
In a joint statement, Jim
Slavin, chair of the Depart-
ment of Atmospheric, Oceanic
and Space Sciences, and Engi-
neering Prof. Mark Daskin,
expressed grief for students
who will never be able to ben-
efit from his instruction.
"We are especially grieved
to think of the students who
will now never be able to learn
from this extraordinary teach-
er and mentor," the statement
said. "Jason's ENG 100 stu-
dents were always inspired by
their first taste of working on
engineering design teams and

malpractice
approach
wins praise
'Michigan Model'
focuses on honesty

By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Claims Man-
agement Model, or "disclosure,
apology and offer," is a shock-
ingly honest approach in an
environment better known for
high-priced lawyers and expen-
sive legal battles.
The system, to combat medi-
cal malpractice claims, has been
a beneficial tool for both patients
and medical staff since its incep-
tion in 2001. The University of
Michigan Health System's new
response to medical errors and
unintended, unanticipated out-
comes was commended in the
December issue of the Milbank
Quarterly, a prestigious health
care journal, for its emphasis on
honesty and disclosure.

LANSING, Mich.
State gov. to spend
more in key areas
Michigan's budget outlook
is stable despite softer-than-
expected economic growth, put-
ting the governor in position to
spend more in key areas while
socking away money and address-
ing long-term costs of retirement
for public workers, the state's
budget director said Thursday.
John Nixon told The Associated
Press that while tax revenues are
lower than projected eight months
ago, much of the dip was expected
because of tax cuts and other pol-
icy changes. He also attributed it
to a "little softer" economy that he
says is turning around.
"We're starting from a posi-
tion of stability. ... We have some
money to invest and to make stra-
tegic investments," he said.

Richard Wayne Landers Jr.
was just 5 years old when he and

ments, disappeared from Wol-

north of Fort Wayne.
Indiana State Police said the
now 24-year-old Landers was
found in Long Prairie, Minn.,

were living under aliases in a
nearby town and confirmed his
identity, investigators said.

Unemployment in
 Greece highest yet
Unemployment has reached
new highs in Greece, with Octo-
ber 2012 figures showing the job-
less rate at 26.8 percent, a major
increase from the same month in
2011.
The country's Statistical
Authority said Thursday that
unemployment increased from
the 26.2 percent in September
2012, and marked a significant
jump from the 19.7 percent of
October 201L The young are the
worst affected, with 56.6 percent
of those aged between 15 and 24
out of work in October 2011.
Greece has been struggling
through a severe financial cri-
sis since late 2009, and has been
dependent on international
rescue loans since May 2010.
In return, the government has
imposed strict austerity mea-
sures that have slashed salaries,
increased taxes and plunged the
country into a recession. Tens
of thousands of businesses have
shut down.

Yemeni tribal chief
killed by al-Qaida
Yemeni security officials say a
prominent tribal chief has been
killed in an ambush, an apparent
revenge attack by al-Qaida for his
security links.
The officials said suspected
al-Qaida militants fatally shot
Ali Abdul-Salam Thursday and
wounded two of his guards as they
rode in his vehicle in the southern
province of Abyan.
Security and tribal officials
said Abul-Salam, an elected local
council member in Shabwa prov-
ince, was accused by militants of
providing information to security
agencies and foreign intelligence
that led to'the targeting of al-Qai-
da members.
The officials were speaking on
condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak
to reporters.
The government, backed by the
U.S., has been going after al-Qaida
militants who have established
strongholds in Yemen's south.

Taliban keeps
bloody insurgency
alive in face of drone
strike attacks
QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) - A
series of bombings in different
parts of Pakistan killed 115 peo-
ple on Thursday, including 81
who died in a sectarian attack
on a bustling billiard hall in the
southwest city of Quetta, offi-
cials said.
The blasts punctuated one
of the deadliest days in recent
years in Pakistan, where the
government faces a bloody
insurgency by Taliban mili-
tants in the northwest and Bal-
uch militants in the southwest.
The country is also home to
many enemies of the U.S. that
Washington has frequently tar-
geted with drone attacks. A U.S.
missile strike Thursday killed
five suspected militants in the
seventh such attack in two

weeks, Pakistani intelligence
officials said.
The billiard hall in Quet-
ta, the capital of Baluchistan
province, was hit by twin
blasts about 5 minutes apart on
Thursday night, killing 81 peo-
ple and wounding more than
120 others, said senior police
officer Zubair Mehmood.
The billiard hall was located
in an area dominated by Shi-
ite Muslims, and most of the
dead and wounded were from
the minority sect, said anoth-
er police officer, Mohammed
Murtaza. Many of the people
who rushed to the scene after
the first blast and were hit by
the second bomb, which caused
the roof of the building to col-
lapse, he said.
Police officers,journalists and
rescue workers who responded
to the initial explosion were also
among the dead, police said.
The sectarian militant group
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed
responsibility for the, attack
to local journalists. One of the

group's spokesmen, Bakar Sad-
diq, said the first blast was car-
ried out by a suicide bomber
and the second was a bomb
planted in a car and detonated
by remote control.
Radical Sunnis groups often
target Pakistan's Shiite minority,
whom they believe hold heretical
views and are not true Muslims.
Earlier in the day, a bomb
targeting paramilitary soldiers
in a commercial area in Quetta
killed 12 people and wounded
more than 40 others, said Sha-
keel, the senior police officer.
The United Baluch Army,
a' separatist group, claimed
responsibility for the attack
on the soldiers in calls to local
journalists.
Elsewhere in Pakistan,
a bomb in a crowded Sunni
mosque in the northwest city
of Mingora killed 22 people and
wounded more than 70, said
senior police officer Akhtar
Hayyat.
No group claimed responsi-
bility for the attack.

Half of Mali is under
Islamic extremist
control
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Mali's president asked France
for help Thursday to counter an
offensive by extremist and ter-
rorist groups who control the
northern half of the country
and are heading south.
France's U.N. Ambassador
Gerard Araud told reporters
after an emergency meeting of
the U.N. Security Council that
urgent action is needed against
the groups who captured the
city of Konna Thursday and
are now threatening the city
of Mopti, which has 100,000
inhabitants.
The Security Council
expressed "grave concern" at
the military action by the ter-
rorist and extremist groups and
called on U.N. member states
"to provide assistance to the
Malian Defense and Security
Forces in order to reduce the
threat posed by terroristorgani-
zations and associated groups."
Araud said it was urgent to
act against the threat and to
work to restore the country's
stability.
"This terrorist attack weak-
ens even more the stability of
Mali and thereby that of its
neighbors," he said. "Sustain-
ability of the Malian govern-
inent and. the protection of
civilian populations are now at
stake,"
Araud said Mali's President
Dioncounda Traore sent'a let-
ter to Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon, which he transmit-
ted to the Security Council, and
a similar letter to French Presi-
dent Francois Hollande seek- .
ing assistance from France,
the country's former colonial
power, against the offensive.

"It's up to the authorities
of my country to decide and
announce the nature of this
assistance," he said. "It will be
announced in Paristomorrow."
Araud said council resolu-
tions "call on all member states
to provide assistance in resolv-
ing the Malian crisis in all its
aspects, including military and
political - and I emphasize - to
provide support to the authori-
ties of this country to put an end
to the terrorist threat."
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice,
asked whether the president of
Mali requested specific kinds
of military support and troops,
said: "It wasn't specific, but it
basically said, 'Help!France."'
Mali was* plunged into tur-
moil after a coup in March 2012
created a security vacuum. That
allowed the secular Tuaregs,
who have longfeltmarginalized
by Mali's government, to take
half the north as a new home-
land. But months later, the reb-
els were kicked out by Islamist
groups allied with' al-Qaida,
which have imposed strict Sha-
riahlaw throughout the north.
Late last year, the 15 nations
in West Africa, including Mali,
agreed on a proposal for the
military to take back the north,
and sought backing from the
United Nations.
The Security Council in
December authorized an
African-led force to support
Malian forces in recover-
ing the north - an area the
size of Texas - but set no
timeline for military action.
Instead, it set out bench-
marks to be met before the
start of offensive operations,
beginning with progress on a
political roadmap to restore
constitutional order, politi-
cal reconciliation, elections
and training of the Malian
and African troops and
police.

Owners lease space
formerly used by
Snyder campaign
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
On the corner of Washing-
ton and Fourth streets, several
blocks away from an empty
building formerly leased to
Borders, a dark-green building
will soon become the home of
the Literati Bookstore. '
The 2,600 square foot build-
ing - empty since last being
used as the office for Michi-
gan Gov. Rick Snyder's 2010
campaign - will open some-
time before spring, according
to owners Hilary Lowe and
Michael Gustafson.
Lowe and Gustafson are
repurposing old shelves from
Borders and are not doing
any construction in the store
before it opens. Because of the
turnkey setup, Lowe and Gus-
tafson are cautiously optimistic
about their ability to open the
storefront within two to three
months.
Both owners spent years
in the publishing and writing
industries, but moved to Ann
Arbor in July to begin opening
the store.
Lowe said she and Gustafson
decided that in the absence of
Borders, it was the right time to
open a bookstore in Ann Arbor.
"The book market is rapidly
changing and evolving," Lowe
said. "Small bookstores have
been able to pick up the market
that Borders left."
Lowe added that although
online retailers like Amazon
offer stiff competition to inde-
pendentbookstores, she believes
Ann Arbor has a strong enough
market to support another
entrant to the market.
"We can't provide the dis-
count pricings of Amazon ...
but (we can provide) a superior
customer service experience,"
she said. "We can (also) try to
carry as diverse an inventory as
possible and pinpoint what the
community needs."

The Literati Bookstore will
join several other independent
book retailers in the downtown
Ann Arbor area such as Aunt
Agatha's, the Crazy Wisdom
Bookstore and Tea Room, the
Dawn Treader Book Shop and
the West Side Book Shop.
Robin Agnew, co-owner of
Aunt Agatha's, a bookstore that
sells new and used myster-
ies, said she's excited about the
opening of another independent
bookstore.
"It is a good synchronicity... it
gets more book shoppers down-
town," Agnew said.
. Agnew said her store had its
best year in 2012. She added that
Lowe and Gustafson have the
potential to be successful if they
limit their variety of titles.
"They might have a good
match if they can keep it lean
and mean," Agnew said. "Ann
Arbor is one of the better (book)
markets ... I don't know what is
happening long term, but I'm
enjoying the moment."
LSA senior Jessica Chick said
she was looking forward to the
arrival of Literati because she
prefers purchasing and reading
physical books over the plethora
of digital media available from
online retailers like Amazon.
"I'm from a small town, so
supporting local businesses is a
huge thing for me," Chick said.
Keith Taylor, coordinator of
the University's creative writing
program, said in an e-mail that
having downtown bookstores
was important because it fosters
a sense of community among
readers.
"Those of us who love to read
books talk to each other," Taylor
wrote. "It can be a very impor-
tant part of our lives."
Taylor added that he spends
large amounts of his money and
time in bookstores around Ann
Arbor and that he intends to
become a regular at Literati if it
has meaningful events in addi-
tion to a desirable book supply.
"I will discover . things
there. I will certainly pur-
chase things there. I will hang
out there," Taylor said. "I only
hope they won't have to ask me
to leave."


Interactive tool
translates rare
papyrus
By CHELSEA HOEDL
Daily StaffReporter
With just the tap of a finger,
some of the University's great-
est ancient documents are now
viewable by anyone.
In late December, the Uni-
versity Library released its
famous Epistles of St. Paul
papyrus, the earliest known
copy of the Letters of St. Paul,
to the general public in the
form of an app available for
download at the Apple App
Store. The papyrus, which was
once only available to a limited
audience, is now accessible by
iPhone or iPad and .offers an
interactive viewing experi-
ence.
The 30-leaf papyrus -
which was purchased by the
University in the 1930s - can
now be downloaded, flipped

through and translated on the
Apple devices.
Arthur Verhoogt, an associ-
ate professor of papyrology and
Greek, developed the free app,
PictureIt:EP, with the help of
the University's 3D Lab in the
Digital Media Commons at the
Duderstadt Center. Verhoogt,
who is the acting archivist for
the University Papyrology Col-
lection, said the app is useful
for academics and interested
individuals.
"For scholars like myself it is
very important to be able to see
the papyrus in its book form,
to be able to flip the page and
things like that," Verhoogt said.
"More importantly, for the gen-
eral audience it's an opportuni-
ty to touch this ancient papyrus
and flip through it."
"That's not something that
can happen with these precious
artifacts in the real world," he
added.
The app provides line-by-
line translations as users drag a
finger over the papyrus. Anno-
tations about peculiarities as

well as the variations between
the papyrus and the common
version are also easily acces-
sible.
3D Lab manager Eric
Maslowski said the innovative
technology shows the ancient
documents in a new way.
"I've seen quite a few other
iBooks out there, a few that
deal with other languages, but
many of them don't have a very
nice interface for translation,"
Maslowski said. "No one else
is really doing this, where they
are showing this rare collection
in new ways."
Although the content of the
papyrus can be found online,
actual images have not been
available until the release of
this app. Verhoogt said similar
texts are often not available on
the Internet because of differ-
ing attitudes on copyright.
He said his colleagues have
expressed enthusiasm about
the technological advancement
and have shown interest in put-
ting other text collections inthe
same format.

COmmunity first
Make renewable energy an inclusive process
's widely acknowledged that renewable energy has tangible
environmental and economic benefits. Always progressive,
Ann Arbor is making steps toward a clean-energy future with
the recent installation of solar panels on University of Michigan
property on Plymouth Road and the planned installation of two
wind turbines in partnership with Ann Arbor Public Schools. How-
ever, community members feel as though they were not consulted
and are understandably upset. While it's indisputable that renew-
able energy is beneficial in the long-term for the Ann Arbor commu-
nity, these projects don't send the right message to the people who
will be directly affected by their presence.

n May 13, 2012, I left JFK
International Airport and
embarked on my three-
month jour-
ney to China.
My first month
would be spent
teaching Eng-
lish, in the
southern city
of Hangzhou,
considered to be -
one of China's PATRICK
"smaller" cities MAILLET
- with a met-
ropolitan popu-
lation of a mere 14 million people.
While I was there, I was able to
travel around Zhejiang Province. I
met middle school and high school
students and taught them about
what my life is like in America.
Naturally, like any truetblue
fan, I took this opportunity to give
a 20-minute presentation about
Michigan football and why there's
truly no place like Ann Arbor. I can-
not even begin to express how ful-
filling it is to hear a chorus of 300
young Chinese students practicing
their English by chanting in unison,
"Go Blue!" and "Oh how I hate Ohio
State." There are now approximately
3,000 students roaming Southern
China who, for some inexplicable
reason, hate everything about Ohio.
Perhaps I abused my privileges, but
I digress.
I was never worried about my
month in Hangzhou because I knew
that meeting new students eager to
learn about my culture would never
get old, and, quite frankly, it never
did. However, I was afraid of June
15, the day I would move to Beijing
and start my intensive two-month
Chinese learning program through
China Educational Tours.
CET Beijing is a well-respected
language program that has been
known to produce stellar results for
those seeking to learn Chinese. I'm a
Chinese minor and have been study-
ing Chinese at the University for
the past two years. My Chinese was
dreadful and desperately needed the
help. Part of me hoped that perhaps
they would just connect a wire to
the back of my brain and somehow

inject the language into me without
actually having to work too hard.
Instead, I was forced to=adjust to
the infamous "language pledge."
This pledge, part of what . makes
CET so renowned, is a signed docu-
ment prohibiting any student from
speaking English in. or outside of
the classroom for the entirety of the
two-month program. If caught three
times breaking the pledge, the stu-
dent is sent home without a refund
and with an unavoidable "Fail" on
their transcript. Quite intimidating
to say the very least.
I knew the pledge would be diffi-
cult, but I had no idea what was in
store for me. As someone who seri-
ously enjoys expressing himself -
perhaps too much - I felt constantly
suffocated once the pledge started..
This pledge, combined with a daily
five hours of class and five to six
hours of homework per night, cre-
ated quite a taIl mountain for me to
climb. I found myself going crazy
and instead of embracing the lan-
guage and culture, I just entered a
terribly depressed and lonely state.
Days seemed like entire weeks, and
the concept of surviving for two
months seemed entirely implausible.
After desperately trying to tackle
this problem on my own, as I always
had before, I began to realize that
this obstacle would not be overcome
alone - I needed help. I needed to
reach out to my friends and family
for the support.
Luckily for me, my sister Kait lived
abroad in Thailand fortwo years and
understood the challenges associ-
ated with living away from home. I
sought her advice and asked how to
overcome this feeling of being alone
in a country of 1.3 billion people. She
gave ne the best advice that anyone
could have. ever given me: Go for a
walk with no destination.
At first I didn't really understand
this concept and waved it off as an
irrational fix to a bigger problem.
But one day, I tried it. I put on some
sneakers, left my map of Beijing in
my room and packed a couple bot-
tles of water. After all, it was about
100 degrees outside and, combined
with a particularly high pollution
rating that day, walking was cer-

tainly going to be.difficult.
Soon after I started my walk, I
started to immerse myself in the
language. I began soaking in more
of the minor details of Chinese cul-
ture and learning more about nor-
mal everyday life in China. This
truly was a turning point in my trip.
3,000 southern
Chinese students
hate Ohio State

At a Jan. 7 City Council meeting, a nearly
$1 million grant from the U.S. Department
of Ann Arbor community was approved for
the construction of two wind turbines. The
turbines will be constructed on Ann Arbor
Public School property. According to Annar-
bor.com Brian Steglitz, a senior utilities engi-
neer for the city, says, "... this is going tobe an
educational tool for the school system, their
kids." He goes on to say it will provide Ann
Arbor Public Schools a hands-on tool to teach
students about wind energy.
While the goal of giving students' tan-
gible means to learn about renewable ener-
gy is admirable, these wind turbines are
not viable options for renewable energy.
Wind farms consist of many wind turbines,
two will not provide sufficient energy to
power a school. Council Member Sabra
Briere (D-1) also noted that Ann Arbor
wind speeds are slightly lower that the 13
mph winds turbines traditionally require.
This sends the message that the city of Ann
Arbor is willing to spend on forms of energy

that aren't suited to the city.
Hundreds of solar panels have been
installed recently on the North Campus
Research Complex on Plymouth Road, with
DTE Energy paying the University for using
the land. Ann Arbor City Council member
Jane Lumm said in a memo to the Michigan
director of community relations that there
was a lack of notice or community engage-
ment prior to the solar panels. The University
should continue tobe on the forefront of new
green technology, but it shouldn't come at the
expense of community members.
Though these environmentally conscious
projects may be well-intentioned, the lack of
community engagement and forethought in
both the turbine and solar array construction
is problematic. When considering changes to
the ways communities are powered, project
leaders and officials must seek the interest
and acceptance of the public. Surveys, forums
and-town hall meetings should be utilized to
gauge public interest before such operations
are implemented.

After that first walk with no des-
tination, I began going on personal
adventures every day after class.
Considering that a ride on Beijing's
incredibly convenient subway is a
mere 30 cents, I took advantage of
this asset as much I could. Every
day, I made it a goal to go to a differ-
ent subway stop; pretty soon, I had
a decent understanding of Beijing's
geography. Some stops were boring,
some were eye-opening, but every
experience helped me become a
stronger person.
Within the coming months,
many students will be embarking
on their own study abroad experi-
ence. Don't be afraid to reach out
for help. Realize that you are not
the only one who has had a bad day
because of missing friends, family,
school or maybe just a slice of pizza.
When you take off the armor,
embrace your vulnerability, and
allow yourself to soak in a foreign
culture, you will learn more about
yourself than you ever thought
possible. When I went to China, I
learned a lot about the language,
the people and the culture, but the
thing I learned most was about
myself and how I handled a par-
ticularly challenging obstacle. I can
only hope that others will take my
sister's advice and discover more
about themselves as I discovered
more about myself.

Have you ever known someone with a
mental health disorder or are you one of the
one-fourth of adult Americans that have
been diagnosed with one? According to the
National Association of Social Workers, "the
primary mission of the social work profes-
sion is to enhance human well-being and help
meet the basic human needs of all people,
with particular attention to the needs and
empowerment of people who are vulnerable,
oppressed, and living in poverty."
The profession of social work impacts indi-
viduals, families and communities not only
through clinical services, but also through
,advocacy. Social workers address issues of
post-traumatic stress disorder, drug and
alcohol addiction, depression and suicid-
al tendencies in the veteran population of
22,658,000 individuals, which is continuous-
ly increasing. In addition, social workers pro-
vide services to other vulnerable populations
including the homeless, mentally ill, abused
children and the elderly.
To enhance services provided and to better
serve clients, we must reinvest back into the
profession. The Dorothy I. Height and Whit-
ney M. Young, Jr. Social Work Reinvestment
Act is a piece of legislation whose a main goal
is to "ensure access to a range of critical social
work services provided in hospitals, schools,
clinics, agencies, the military, and in private
businesses." The bill was introduced to the
U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Edol-
phus Towns (D - Md) and to the Senate by
Senator Barbara Mikulski (D - N.Y.)w. This
piece of legislation, if passed, will reinvest in
the profession of social work by focusing on
the areas of research, retention and recruit-
ment. A commission, working in conjunction
with Congress, will be established and will
collaborate with universities, researchbodies
and various social workers to analyze their
services and programs to develop strategies
for improvement. The Social Work Reinvest-
ment Act will also allocate grants to various
programs to address workplace improve-
ments, research, education and training.
Although social -workers play such an
inportant'role in the well-being of society,

the profession faces the issue of burnout. It
is in dire need of trained professionals with
an expected 130,000 empty social worker
positions in 2016. Social workers earn among
the lowest salaries for master's level gradu-
ates and for professionals in general. Profes-
sionals with lower-paying salaries are more
likely to work in difficult agencies, serve
the most vulnerable clients and leave the
social work profession early. Social workers
face high burnout rates including emotional
exhaustion, depersonalization or cynicism
and diminished personal accomplishment.
The Social Work Reinvestment Act would
reduce the turnover rate in the profession
and increase the quality, consistency and
stability of social work services. The United
States is ranked 10th in G.D.P. spending in
the health care and social services category.
Its spending on social services is especially
low. It spends 90 cents on social services for
every dollar spent on health care. Contrast
this to many of our peer countries who spend
two dollars on social services for every dollar
spent on health care. Allocating more funds
to social services has proven to reduce emer-
gency room visits due to poor nutrition, poor
hygiene, infections, muggings, beatings and
rape in homeless populations.
Rep. Towns once stated, "Not everyone will
need a social worker, but when life presents
serious obstacles to one's well-being, a social
worker can be an invaluable ally. We want to
make sure that when people do need a social
worker, professional help will be available."
The Social Work Reinvestment Act not only
affects those currently employed in the field
of social work and students in social work
programs, but individuals, families and com-
munities who may one day need the assis-
tance of a social worker. Help us advocate
for the future of society and its well-being
by spreading the word to family, friends and
peers, and by letting your congressional rep-
resentative know this bill is important to you.

Malmberg are masters students at the

TO THE DAILY:
Sanctions on Iraq may have

months before residents are
scheduled to move inis "irregu-
lar of the industry."
"Any time we begin a develop-
ment we're extremely sensitive
to the fact that we will have stu-
dents depending on us for their
housing needs," Shinskie said.
"Fortunately, since we've had
a mild winter, we are already
ahead of schedule ... (we have)
ample time to prepare the prop-
ertyfor resident move-in."
Campus Apartments, the
management company, will
equip the building with furni-
ture, gym equipment, televisions

and other finishing touches once
the construction is completed in
June. These features should take
between two and three weeks to
install.
Two months after Landmark
- the new high-rise on South
University Avenue - opened in
September, several promised
amenities were still unavailable.
Residents were given $500 Visa
gift cards or $500 in rent reduc-
tions to as a result.
To assure prospective resi-
dents that a similar situation
won't occur, Campus Apart-
ments is offering the "Varsity
Vow," which promises a $150
rent reduction every month that
amenities are not complete.
Sarah Tatum, Campus Apart-

ments regional sales and training
specialist, said she is planning to
avoid chaos on move-in day by
assigning residents staggered
move-in dates. She added that a
staff of extra managers, cleaners
and vendors will be. on-site dur-
ing move-in to accommodate any
needs that residents may have.
Shinskie said he plans on giv-
ing small tours to residents who
have already signed leases once
interior finishes are completed
to "give them the comfort that
their building is going to be done
on time."
"We don't ever stop trying
to refine and make our product
better," Shinskie said. "I think
students are going to be really
impressed."

EARLY
From Page 1
associated with a greater vol-
ume of applications, Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon
expressed excitement about
the growing number of appli-
cants in an e-mail interview.
"As application numbers at
some of our peer schools seem
to be decreasing or flattening
out, the continuing applica-
tion increases to Michigan
are very gratifying," Hanlon
wrote. "It affirms our stand-
ing as a really great school
that provides some of the
best-quality and most desir-
able educational opportuni-
ties in the country."
Still, an increase in appli-
cations does not necessarily
equate to a greater yield, which
is the number of students who
accept their admittance and
enroll at the University.
In a September interview,
Hanlon said the class of 2016's
freshman enrollment is the
smallest since 2008. This
decrease occurred in the same
year that the number of total,
applications, including regular
decision applicants, reached a
record high with a 7.5 percent
increase over the previous
year.
Beyond the number of early

action applications received,
officials at the office of Under-
graduate Admissions declined
to release or predict any indica-
tors of the number of deferrals
from this year or past years.
The office has traditionally
declined to release prelimi-
nary statistics before the next
cycle of admissions.
"We are extremely pleased
with how the 2012-2013 Early
Action process went," Ted
Spencer, Office of Under-
graduate Admissions execu-
tive director and associate vice
provost wrote in a statement.
"Beyond that, it is too early to
analyze the type of trend ques-
tions ... at this point."
While admissions officials
continue to review deferred
decisions, the results are still
sinking in at high schools
like North Farmington High
School, located about 25 miles
from Detroit in Oakland Coun-
ty.
While North Farmington
may not be representative of
overall admissions trends, it
does provide insight into this
year's release of early action
decisions. Last year, 42 stu-
dents from a class of 350
accepted their admittance to
the University.
"There were a number of stu-
dents who were deferred that
surprised us, which just goes to

show that the level of competi-
tion is increasing every year,"
North Farmington counselor
Lynn Maher said.
At North Farmington, many
students were taken aback by
what seemed to be an increase
in deferrals.
"I definitely feel as if more
(students) got deferred than in
any of the past years," Morgan
Kiryakoza, a deferred North
Farmington senior who was
deferred, said. "The reaction
at North was shock. It seemed
to shake the confidence of our
grade asa whole."
As in every admissions cycle,
some students expected the
decision they received.
"I was kind of expecting
deferral," Nick Kipper, a North
Farmington senior, said. "My
ACT score is low for Michigan,
but I have a good GPA and tons
of extracurricular (activities).
Both of my brothers attend-
ed Michigan and were also
deferred before their admit-
tance."
Despite deferred decisions,
many students continue to hold
out hope for acceptances when
final decisions are released in
early April.
And for these deferred stu-
dents, as well as their counter-
parts across the country, the
waiting game will continue.

Egypt names a new central
bank governor

President chooses
new leader in wake
of economic troubles
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's presi-
dent on Thursday named a new
head for the country's central
bank, after the resignation of
the longtime chief amid a crip-
pling economic crisis and pound
devaluation.
Hesham Ramez, an execu-
tive from one of Egypt's larg-
est private banks, will replace
Farouq el-Oqdah, who has been
the bank's governor for nine
years, according to presidential
spokesman Yasser Ali. .
El-Oqdah and Ramez sought
on Thursday to reassure mar-
kets, investors and Egyptians
over the handover of a key post
at a deeply uncertain time. The
central bank says Egypt's for-
eign currency reserves have hit
a "critical minimum level" after
being drained by more than half
over the past two years to around
$15 billion. Revenues from tour-
ism and foreign investment have
tumbled amid the unrest since
the uprising that toppled Presi-
dent Hosni Mubarak, even as
the government has had to bleed
hard currency to prop up the
Egyptian pound, keep up with
debt payments and buy vital
imports.
At the same time, the gov-
ernment of Islamist President
Mohammed Morsi tried to put
together a plan for halting the
economic slide, which is likely
to include the reduction of some

vital subsidies on foodstuff and
fuel that Egypt's poor rely on.
"We had a difficult two
years," el-Oqdah said, appear-
ing Thursday with Ramez at the
presidential palace. "Despite
that, the economy is tenacious.
We have problems no doubt, but
we have what it takes to get out."
El-Oqdah has made clear for
the past year that he wanted to
step down, but there were wide-
spread concerns that his depar-
ture could further unsettle the
economy. Egypt is negotiating a
critical $4.8 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund,
already delayed because of the
political tension. A report of his
resignation last month rattled
markets briefly until it was
announced he was staying on.,
El-Oqdah said the solution
of the economic problems lies
in resolving political disputes
which have further hit investor
confidence in the economy. The
country has been deeply divided
since a political dispute over the
recently adopted constitution
spiraled into street protests and
violence.
He said the worry now was not
the value ofthe pound since asys-
tem is in place to regulate it. The
bank recently shired auctioning
dollars to coat "the drain of
the dollar in ktet because
of hoarding a , eculation. In
only a few weeks, the pound fell
to around 6.5'to the dollar down
from 6.1 in December.
"The last thing I need to worry
about is the exchange rate," he
said. The chief concern now is
to increase revenues to cover

increasing budget and trade defi-
cit and bring in foreign invest-
ment.
Ramez, who previously was
the central bank's deputy gov-
ernor for foreign reserve and
monetary policies, said the bank
has "all the tools to intervene
if we think there is speculation
or against the market. What we
care about isto make it a natural
balanced market."
"I would like to reassure you.
There is nothing to make us
worry because we look at the
prices momentarily and daily. It
is not out of control. We will be
able to control it."
Some in the political party of
the Muslim Brotherhood, from
which Morsi hails, have sug-
gested el-Oqdah was to blame
for mismanaging the country's
reserves. There have been hints
of tension between the bank
head and Morsi's administra-
tion, which came into office in
June.
But on Thursday, el-Oqdah
said his resignation was not
from political reasons but in line
with the newly passed constitu-
tion that limit terms of public
office. Trying to sound a further
note of reassurance, he referred
to Ramez as his "student."
Ramez has been vice chair-
man and managing director of
the Commercial International
Bank since 2011, and has been
on the board of several banks.
He is expected to start in the
governor's post in February
after his nomination is formally
approved by the upper house of
parliament.

MALPRACTICE
From Page 1
chief medical officer Darrell
Campbell, based on three cen-
tral principles: compensating
patients quickly and fairly when
unreasonable care caused injury,
supporting clinical staff when
the treatment was sensible or
did not negatively impact the
clinical outcome, and reducing
patient injuries by learning from
patients' experiences.
Rick Boothman, executive
director of clinical safety and co-
author of "The Michigan Model,"
observed issues with malprac-
tice lawsuits as a trial lawyer for
more than 20 years before devel-
oping the new approach.
"One, there was a lot of unnec-
essary litigation that occurred
because people simply didn't talk
to each other," Boothman said.
"But more importantly, two, I
felt that the process of litigation
got in the way of patient safety
improvements."
The development of this new
approach to malpractice dramat-
ically changed the way suits are
handled, accordingto Campbell.
"We were trying to improve
the culture of the hospital by
advocating for openness and
honesty," Campbell said. "Rick
(Boothman) was able to put in
place a mechanism that would
take the big picture goals for this
institution into a-legal environ-
ment and it has worked beauti-
fully."
Although the approach was
developed to decrease malprac-
tice claims, the true efforts were
aimed at medical care.
"But the real goal was not
necessarily to lower our medical
malpractice claims numbers, the
real goal was to improve patient
safety," Boothman said.
The authors of the article in
Milbank Quarterly, researchers
from Harvard Medical School
and the Massachusetts Medical
Society, view the University's
strategy as promising and advan-
tageous for the state. The article
included 37 physician interviews,
which unanimously said "The
Michigan Model," better known
as the DA&O model, has a pos-

sibility of improving medical
liability and patient safety.
Campbell added that he sees
honesty as the underlying suc-
cess of the strategy.
"Honesty and transparency
- that is the main principle,"
Campbell said. "If the people that
you're talking with think you're
being honest, you can solve a lot
of problems."
Basing the model around the
principles of honesty has been a
dramatic change in the culture of
malpractice lawsuits.
"Honesty and transparency
was revolutionary at the time
because most lawyers, like me,
were telling doctors 'for God's
sakes, don't talk about things'
for fear that a stray comment
would somehow compromise
our defense in court," Boothman
said.
Since changing from a deny-
and-defend approach to the
DA&O model, malpractice claims
per month and total liability
costs have decreased, claims are
resolved faster and UMHS has
made a habit of avoiding litiga-
tion.
Despite doubts and predic-
tions of increased malpractice
suits, "The Michigan Model" has
silenced the nonbelievers.
"Everybody said when we
started doing this, 'Oh my god
the floodgates are going to open
up and you are going to be inun-
dated with lawsuits,' because
we're honest," Campbell said.
"That didn't happen. In fact, it's
the opposite."
The DA&O model not only
avoids litigation and decreas-
es the number of malpractice
claims, but it is also a useful
tool for identifying problems in
patient care, according to Booth-
man.
"The transparency and hon-
esty has opened the door and
opened our eyes to pockets of
problems," Boothman said. "So
right now we can target spe-
cific areas that are dangerous.
For instance, we know that the
culture in the operating room,
which tends to be very hierarchi-
cal, is dangerous because nurses-
that do not feel comfortable
speaking up to surgeons can lead
to bad things."
In 2010, after DA&O was fully

implemented within UMHS,
the average monthly rate of new
claims decreased from 7.03 to
4.52 for every 100,000 patients
seen, according to the Annals of
Internal Medicine.
According to the Journal of
Health and Life Sciences Law,
the number of new claims in 1999
was 136 and the number of new
claims decreased by 2006 to 61.
This modelwas also praised by
the Annals of Internal Medicine
in 2010 and the Journal of Health
and Life Sciences Law in 2009. It
was featured in the American
College of Healthcare Execu-
tives' publication, the Frontiers
of Health Services Management,
in 2012.
On Dec. 13, 2012, Campbell
and Boothman presented DA&O
to the University's Board of
Regents as a feasible option for
hospitals throughout the coun-
try.
The full version of DA&O
received additional research
grants from the Agency of
Healthcare Research and Quali-
ty to study the effect of the model
as a principal response system
for malpractice crises.
"We've been trying to under-
stand whether it's portable to
other places or not," Campbell
said. "We have our own malprac-
tice insurance and that makes it
easier. People wonder if it's only
applicable to groups who have
their own insurer, or is it just a
function of Boothman's success
as a leader."
Legislation and research
efforts have also been launched
in New York, Illinois, Washing-
ton, Massachusetts, Oregon and
Florida based on "The Michigan
Model."
DA&O has shifted the focus of
medicine from the physicians to
patients, according to Boothman.
"We have recognized that
medicine for generations has
been physician-centric. Even
though we are treating patients,
the whole system is built around
more the convenience of the phy-
sician than the interests of the
patients," Boothman said. "This
experience has caused us, now
going forward,.to work hard on
becoming patient-centered."

among 106 organizations across
the country named ACOs Thurs-
day.
Jonathan Blum, deputy
administrator and director of
the Center for Medicare, said in a
conference call thatthis program
is a prelude to the eventual status
of health care as a whole.
"We feel this program is
not only our future but really
the future 'of health care, and
that is really as we are chang-
ing towards value-based health
care," Blum said.
At a press conference, not-
ing that the program is specifi-
cally targeted to improve care for
particularly susceptible patient

groups. .
"Our mission is ... really about
improving the quality of care -
especially for vulnerable and at
risk populations," Blum said.
David Spahlinger, associ-
ate dean for clinical affairs, will
be leading POM, according to
UMHS. According to a study
in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, POM's
forerunner group saved Medi-
care $22 million between 2005
and 2010. The overall savings
averaged $2,499 per patient.
"Their focus on transition
calls, needs assessment for ongo-
ing care management, develop-
ment of comprehensive care
plans, integration with primary
care sites and medication rec-
onciliation played a role in the
resource reductions of this vul-
nerable population," Spahlinger

said in a Sept. 2012 statement.
"We know that quality improved
in addition to our cost reduc-
tions, making this a double win
for patients and the agencies that
provide their coverage."
U.S. Secretary of Health and
Human Services Kathleen Sebe-
lius was one of the speakers on
Thursday's conference call.
"Accountable Care Organiza-
tions save money for Medicare
and deliver higher-quality care
to people with Medicare," Sebe-
lius said. "Thanks to the Afford-
able Care Act, more doctors and
hospitals are working together
to give people with Medicare the
high-quality care they expect
and deserve."
Blum said it's "too early for us
to talk about results" but is opti-
mistic about the success of ear-
lier ACO programs.

highlight the
Frieze Memorial Organ, which
is housed in Hill.
The concert will also feature
the UMS Choral Union, who
will perform along with DSO
brass and-percussion and Organ
Professor James Kibbie in the
opening piece, "Tu es Petrus"
by James MacMillan. The Cho-
ral Union is a choir consist-
ing of a wide variety of singers:
some faculty, some students,
some young and some old, led by
Director of Choirs Jerry Black-
stone. The group has been fea-
tured in concerts with the DSO
as well as the Ann Arbor Sym-

phony Orchestra.
"The pieces in this particu-
lar concert were chosen to be
a kickoff celebration for Hill's
birthday," Blackstone said, "And
for this first concert, we wanted
to celebrate the organ."
The centerpiece of the con-
cert, the Frieze Memorial
Organ, is older than Hill Audito-
rium itself. The organ was built
in Detroit and featured at the
1893 World's Columbian Expo-
sition in Chicago. The follow-
ing year, it was shipped to Ann
Arbor and named after Henry
Simmons Frieze, a Latin pro-
fessor and interim University
President. Frieze was a principal
founder of UMS, and the organ
was named in his honor after his
death in 1889.
"This event is a very big deal
for organists," Kibbie said.
It is rare that an organ should
be featured in a concert accom-
panied by a symphony orches-
tra, and this will be Kibbie's first
time playing with the DSO.
"A group of organists have
actually purchased a large block
of seats up in the mezzanine, and
they're all going to sit up there
together as a cheering section,"
Kibbie added.
The Frieze Memorial organ
isn't the only organ on campus.
Organs reside in Moore Hall,
Burton Tower, various prac-
tice rooms and even the School
of Public Health, the location
of Brown Bag recitals on every
other Wednesday at 12:15 p.m.

Watts is the on-screen stand-
out. She's electrifying.as a physi-
cally wounded and emotionally
broken mother who experiences a
role reversal (again, the maternal
archetype is challenged here, but
in another fashion). Maria must
rely on Lucas to play caretaker as
both her mind and body fall apart.
In a delicate portrayal, Watts
embodies the agony of total pow-
erlessness during horrific circum-
stances, butthough all signs point
to defeat, she is still determinedto
fight for her life.
It's no surprise that Watts's
authentic performance has
earned her both Golden Globe
and Oscar nods, two more fights
of which the winner is yet to be
determined. But, win or lose,
there's no life-or-death situation
there.
"The Impossible" puts things
into perspective. It's a stagger-
ing look at the bigger picture,
which is certainly not shiny, gold
statues - it's a healthy, loving
family. Lose that and there's no,
"you'll get 'em next year."

Fashion show to
raise funds for arts

EnspiRED to host
seventh annual
charity event
By CARLINA DUAN
Daily Community Culture Editor
On Saturday, the student orga-
nization EnspiRED will host its
seventh annual charity fashion
show in the
Biomedical Sci- EnspiRED
ence Research
Building at 7 Pnts
p.m. This year's The Year
show revolves
around the
theme "The Fashion

ture," and will

tiques across the U.S.
EnspiRED, created in 2006,
promotes arts awareness and
passion for the arts across cam-
pus by showcasing various arts-
based events throughout the
year.
"EnspiRED started essen-
tially to highlight the arts and
different artists on campus,"
said LSA junior Tyrell Collier,
the show's production manager.
"We promote the collabora-
tion of arts through the various
events that we host, but our big-
gest event of the year is always
the fashion show."
"The Year of Couture" will
be a charity fundraiser for Art
Roads, a nonprofit group that
aims to restore arts classes in
southeastern Michigan elemen-
tary schools where budget cuts
have diminished arts programs.
LSA senior Chatoris Jones,
president of EnspiRED,
explained the logic behind
choosing Art Roads as this year's
fashion show charity organiza-
tion.
"When I was in elementary
school, we had art classes. Now-
adays, art's gone," Jones said.
"Art Roads keeps art within
schools. That's what we want
to do at Michigan. Yeah, we're a
research institution. Some stu-

dents here are going pre-med,
are more into engineering and
are getting into B-School ... but
what about those individuals
that are here to keep art alive?"
By choosing Art Roads, Jones
hopes to sustain the importance
of art both on campus and with-
in schools across Michigan.
"Although art is something
that's fun, it also helps you feel
good. You can express yourself,"
Jones said.
Other than the fashion show,
EnspiRED also creates several
gallery-like events throughout
the year, titled "Arts Experienc-
es," which showcase local and
student artists and musicians.
Collier noted a similar theme
of accentuating the arts in the
fashion show.
"Although ('The Year of Cou-
ture') is a fashion show, we do
showcase and highlight vari-
ous forms of art throughout the
show," he said.
The fashion show will fea-
ture clothing designs and fuse
together differing art forms like
dance, visual art and live music.
This year's show promises a
hip-hop performance by rap-
per Mahd, and host James "Mr.
GQue" Stratford.
"The Year of Couture" pres-
ents a different spin on the tra-
ditional couture, high-class art
sphere.
"Our fashion show is not sup-
posed to be like New York Fash-
ion Week - it's supposed to be
arts through fashion. It's all
about individuality. When you
wake up, whatever you dress
up as, that's what inspires you,"
Jones said.
Rather than focus on the tra-
ditional meaning of "couture"
as high-fashion, EnspiRED
chose to craft a new definition of
"couture," one that proves more
accessible to the arts.
"What we're taking is whole,
high-fashion European kind of
couture, and making it an every-
day kind of couture," Jones said.
"We are not a fashion organiza-
tion. We are an arts-based orga-
nization."
Collier added: "It's 'The Year
of Couture,' so basically we want
to bring legendary concept of
couture but compare it to every-
day-wear as well. We want to
basically show that couture can
be represented by more demo-

graphics than it's usually repre-
sented in."
Instead of primarily featur-
ing clothing from local fashion
boutiques like last year's fash-
ion show, "The Year of Cou-
ture" showcases designers from
across the country.
"This year, we've gone out to
up-and-coming fashion design-
ers, and also to other boutiques,"
Jones said.
Ann Arbor local fashion
boutiques Wendy, Launch and
Cool Club Clothing will also be
highlighted. All four seasons of
clothing - spring, summer, win-
ter and fall - will be featured
throughout the show, emphasiz-
ing the year-round couture look.
The student models, chosen by
EnspiRED through a modeling
call at the beginning of the year,
will pose in various clothing
designs.
New to this year's fashion
show will be three levels of
tickets available for purchase:
Premium VIP, VIP and General
Admission. Premium VIP guests
can attend a pre-show reception,
where they will be treated to a
catered meal, in addition to live
musical entertainment by three
singers, two of which are Uni-
versity students. Both Premium
VIP and VIP guests willbe given
preferred seating, as well as a
"Swag Box" of gift items. The
pre-show reception begins at
6 p.m. and doors open at 7 p.m.
for VIP and General Admission
guests.
Collier explained the deci-
sions behind adding the Pre-
mium VIP, VIP and General
Admission.
"Last year, we hit capacity.
We didn't have enough seats.
This year, we added the pre-
show reception because that
was another aspect of doing
something different and another
way to showcase more artists as
well," he said.
For both Jones and Collier,
anticipation for the show is blend-
ed with excitement.
"I'm excited to see how it looks,
to see if we sell out, and I'm hoping
to give a good amount of money to
the charity," Collier said.
Jones added, "This will be the
best thing that hits Michigan.
That's something that we do in
EnspiRED. We push the edges.
We dare tobe different."

Standout defender
transfers to Michigan

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Writer
In 2012, the Michigan women's
soccer team shut out more than
half of the teams it played. With
the addition of its newest mem-
ber, finding the back of the Wol-
verines' net might prove even,
more challenging next season.
Michigan' coach Greg Ryan
announced the transfer of Olivia
Brannon on Wednesday - one of
the nation's top defenders - into
the program. A member of the
United States National Team's
under-20 squad, Brannon comes
from Virginia looking to improve
a Wolverine defense that record-
ed 13 shutouts and allowed just
17 goals in 2012, both program
bests.
"Olivia is going to be an impact
player for us," Ryan said. "Hav-
ing Olivia join us will only make
us stronger. It's going to really
solidify the defense and give us
new tactical options."
A graduate of Athens High
School in Troy, Brannon was
named the Gatorade Michigan
State Player of the Year in 2011.
After representing the United .
States in international compe-
tition at various age levels, she
was Ryan's most sought-after
recruit and one of the top pros-
pects in the country. But Bran-
non enrolled at Virginia, where
she started all 24 matches as a
freshman and earned ACC All-

Freshman honors.
The Cavaliers were one of the
nation's best teams in 2012, but
were upset by Duke in the Sweet
16 of this year's NCAA Totirna-
ment.
"Our soccer program, at the
time we were recruiting (Bran-
non), wasn't nearly as strong as
the University of Virginia's,"
Ryan said. "So she chose to go to
Virginia."
It's not like that anymore. In
2012, the Wolverines finished
third in the Big Ten and made a
deep run into the NCAA Tour-
nament, and the majority of
that team will return next sea-
son. Brannon will likely line up
alongside junior Shelina Zador-
sky, an All-Big Ten defender who
plays for the Canadian Women's
National Team.
The NCAA grants athletes -
except those competing in foot-
ball or basketball - a one-time
transfer exception, which will
allow Brannon to play immedi-
ately.
With the resurgence of the
soccer program, a coaching
staff that has succeeded at an
international level and the Big
Ten's recent expansion into the
East Coast, Ryan hopes Michi-
gan's appeal will keep vaunted
recruits in-state in the future.
"We may see more like Olivia
down the road," Ryan said. "She
wanted to come back home and
play in her home state."

In wake of Alaska series, M1me defects

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
Michigan will host Alaska at
Yost Ice Arena - the last time
the two schools will meet for
the foreseeable
future - this NOTEBOOK
weekend for a
two-game set. w
The Nanooks, who currently
sit in a tie with the Wolverines
for seventh place in the CCHA,
haven't played since Dec. 8 -
34 days prior to tonight's series
opener.
With Michigan razor thin
on its blue line due to a pair of
injuries during Tuesday night's
loss to Bowling Green, coach
Red Berenson will need to get
creative. But when the team has
given up more goals in confer-
ence play than any other league
team, creativity isn't exactly
what you want to see.
And while it's difficult to
anticipate how exactly the
Nanooks will look coming off a

month-long break, it isn't as hard
to predict how Berenson plans to
fix his patchwork defense - or
as Berenson called it, a "rotating
defense" - long thought to be
the team's strength entering the
season.
One coping strategy will be
moving senior forward Jeff
Rohrkemperback to the blue line.
Rohrkemper filled in on defense
against Northern Michigan ear-
lier this season.
The Wolverines will also make
adjustments in how ice time is
allotted. During the Great Lakes
invitational, sophomore defen-
seman Mike Szuma was thrust
into action despite being one of
the unit's less experienced play-
ers. Berenson compensated by
limiting the number of minutes
he played.
The lone bright spot the
defense is the return of its long-
awaited top pairing of freshman
Jacob Trouba and senior 'Jon
Merrill, who will take a huge
chunk of the ice time.

"Trouba and Merrill are going
to play a lot more than the other
four," Berenson said of the Alaska
series.
Berenson said that he usually
puts a 25-minute ceiling on his
top pairing's ice time going into
games. Forwards, by contrast,
are typically in the eight to 18
minute range.
DEFECTION TO MAJOR
JUNIORS: Freshman forward
Daniel Milne has left the Michi-
gan hockey program, the team
confirmed Thursday.
Milne, a Unionville, Ont.
native, played in seven games
this season without tallying
a point. He signed an Ontario
Hockey League Standard Player
Agreement with the Owen Sound
AttackThursday.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said in a statement that Milne
informed him of the decision to
leave Ann Arbor on Thursday.
"While we are disappointed
with his decision, it is important
to note that he is leaving in good

academic standing," Berenson
said in the statement.
Milne was selected in the
third round of the 2010 OHL Pri-
ority Selection.
"We are extremely thrilled
that Daniel has chosen the Attack
and the OHL to further his hock-
eycareer,"said Owen Sound gen-
eral manager Dale DeGray. "In
2010, we felt that he was a player
that could contribute greatly to
our team and our feelings have
not wavered in that regard."
KEEPING THE PIPELINE
STRONG: While one former St.
Michael's Buzzer left the pro-
gram Thursday, another one
joined it on Wednesday.
Defenseman Jared Walsh
committed to join the Michigan
program for the 2015-16 season.
Walsh has 16 points, including
15 assists, for the Buzzers of the
Ontario Junior Hockey League.

release from the Buzzers, he was
offered "several" NCAA scholar-
ships and an OHL contract.

game. It's a return to the place
where he grew up.
"It means a lot for all of us, but
I'm definitely excited to be back
playing in front of my home-
town," Burke said. "It's a real big
game."
Burke, the reigning National

gan (3-0, 16-0) has improved'
since last year's Big Ten Tourna-
ment championship, when the
Buckeyes thumped the Wolver-
ines, 77-55.
Michigan has matched its best
start in program history, and a
big reason for that is its dynamic
offense. Led by Burke's team-
high 18.3 points and 7.3 assists,
the Wolverines rank 10th in the
countryin points per game (80.8),
fourth in field-goal percentage

(51.4) and have four starters scor-
ing in double figures.
The Wolverines cooled off a
bit.in their gritty 62-47 win over
Nebraska, posting their lowest
offensive output of the season
and shooting 3-of-17 from behind
the arc, but will try to return to
their efficient ways on offense
against a Buckeye team that
allows less than 60 points per
game.

Last year when the Michigan
basketball team went down to
Columbus in a mid-season Big
Ten showdown, it didn't come
back to Ann Arbor happy.
The Buckeyes bullied the
Wolverines around all game,
beating them on the boards and
getting second-chance points
throughout. The 64-49 Ohio
State win gave Michigan its fifth
consecutive loss in true away
games. The storyline for that
game was then-freshman point
guard Trey Burke returning to
his hometown to take on child-
hood best friend Jared Sullinger.
Since then, things have
changed. Michigan went 4-1 on
the road after thatgame and has
continued its run this season,
remaining undefeated in its first
16 contests.
And with Sullinger now play-
ing with the Boston Celtics in
the NBA, Burke has taken his
place in the National Player of
the Year conversation.
But the Wolverines (3-0 Big
Ten, 16-0 overall) will have to
worry about a different domi-
nant force in the middle. Versa-
tile 6-foot-7 forward Deshaun
Thomas, who busted out-for the
Buckeyes down the stretch last
season and earned himself a pre-
season'player of the year nomi-
nation. The junior is averaging
over 20 points and nearly seven
rebounds per game this season
for No.15 Ohio State (2-1,12-3).
The Daily got a chance to talk
with him at Big Ten Media Day
in October.

The Michigan Daily: Do you
ever think about how you com-
pare to the other top players in
the country, like last year did
you compare yourself to Thomas
Robinson or Anthony Davis?
Deshaun Thomas: Not really.
I was just trying to go out there
and be the best player I could be.
They were great players and if.
you noticed - I don't know why
people always get on me about
my defense - but I held Dray-
mond Green, Robbie Hummel,
I held them pretty well. But I
never try to be like them or tryto
fit my role like them.
TMD: Last year, Sullinger
took on the role of guarding the
opposing team's best big man.
Do you think you'll have that
role this year?
DT: To me, I don't think I
will. It just depends on the sys-
tem, how coach (Thad Matta)
wants us to run it. We have a
shot blocker now, Amir Wil-
liams. So he can be our starter,
and if he gets in foul trouble or
(Evan Ravenel) gets in foul trou-
ble, I'll probably have to hold
(the opposing player) for a little
bit, frustrate him a little bit. But
I don't think I'll be that player
like Jared that was holding the
best player on the team.
TMD: Do you feel more com-
fortable guarding someone on
the perimeter where you can use
both your size and quickness?
DT: By me getting my body
right and being in shape, I can
be that player who can hold
some of the perimeters. If you
think about it, Cincinnati had all
guards out there (in the NCAA
Tournament last year) and one

big and I did that pretty well.
Note: The Buckeyes beat the
Bearcats 81-66 in the Sweet 16.
Thomas was effective offensive-
ly too, leading all scorerswith 24
points.
TMD: What's the change in
your leadership role with Sull-
inger and William Buford leav-
ing? Is it harder?
DT: I don't think it's really
that hard. By me coming back
last year and freshman year,
I learned a lot - you've got to
learn to be more vocal from
the older guys. You've got to be
more of a leader. I don't think
it's hard because in practice,
coach has pointed me out and I
talked to the guys and I have no
problem talking to them. And
they listen, and we had a great
practice.
TMD: How long did it take to
get used to that?
DT: Freshman year, I don't
remember saying nothing. I
wasn't even talking. I came a
long way. Sophomore year it was
getting there, getting better.
Then junior year it just got way
better. By having experience in
being here and learning from
David Lighty and Jon (Diebler)
and Jared and learning from
(Aaron) Craft - but it was natu-
ral for him. But being that lead-
er is not so bad and being that
more vocal.
TMD: Do you feel more com-
fortable on the court when you
have that type of role?
DT: I feel more comfortable
on the court and off the court.
Just talking to my teammates,
texting them, asking them how
they're doing off the court.
