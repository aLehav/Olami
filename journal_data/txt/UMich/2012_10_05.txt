RANKINGS
- 'U' places
20th in
new global
rankings

* British publication
lists 400 best
universities
around the world
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
The University was ranked
20th on a 2012-2013 list
released Thursday of the top
400 universities in the world.
The list is released annu-
ally by the Times High-
er Education, a British
higher education publication.
The rankings are based on 13
variables divided into five cat-
egories that measure univer-
sity performance: teaching,
research, citations, industry
income and international out-
look.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said though he's
proud of how the University
fared, rankings aren't the most
important indicator of a uni-
versity's success.
"What you or I may have
picked for a college is some-
thing that's unique and indi-
vidual," Fitzgerald said. "So
rankings are nice, but they

are not what students should
be basing their decisions on
where to attend college."
Though the University
dropped two spots from last
year's rankings, Phil Baty, the
editor of the Times Higher
Education Rankings, said
it was a difficult year for
American and British institu-
tions. Specifically, she noted
tough competition from Asian
institutions benefitting from
significant funding and gov-
ernment support, according to
a University press release.
California Institute of
Technology was ranked first,
followed by the University of
Oxford and Stanford Universi-
ty. The University of Michigan
was the third-highest ranked
American public institution in
the Times' rankings. The Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley
came in ninth and the Univer-
sity of California, Los Angeles
ranked 13th.
Baty said in the release that
the top 200 schools comprise
just 1 percent of the world's
colleges and universities.
In addition to ranking the
world's top institutions, the
Times Higher Education also
ranks world universities by

SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. - Slip-
pery Rock, the Division II school
whose football team's scores are

games, has engaged in discus-
sions with the Michigan Athletic
Department about playing a foot-
ball game at Michigan Stadium,
according to multiple sources at
the school.
Slippery Rock Athletic Direc-
tor Paul Lueken said on Thursday
that Slippery Rock is "exploring
the options" with the Michigan
Athletic Department, but said,
"nothing is definite." A potential
plan would have Slippery Rock

son.
"We love our positive relation-
ship with Michigan football fans
and how supportive they are of
our program and look forward
to a possible game in the future,"
Lueken said.
Michigan declined to discuss
the matter, but Associate Athletic
Director Dave Ablauf cautioned
that these conversations aren't
uncommon and in many cases,

nify a deal is imminent.
"We have discussions with a
lot of schools, some that come to
fruition and some that don't due
to a multitude of reasons," Ablauf
wrote in an e-mail. "As a matter
of policy, we won't comment on
any on-going discussions that we
might have with a school until
the ink is dry on a contract."

In light of the increasing
prominence of women's health
care issues in national politics,

the University's Institute for
Research on Women and Gender
is hosting a Sex and Justice Con-
ference this weekend to promote
discussion on the many forms
that sexual injustice takes in
today's society.
Multiple campus departments
are also involved in the confer-
ence, which began Thursday and
will continue through Saturday.
By focusing on the intersection

between sexual identities and
other factors, such as race, the
conference aims to change the
conversation on how sex and jus-
tice are intertwined.
The conference will focus on
intersectionality, a feminist soci-
ological theory that examines
how institutions, such as gen-
der, race and sexual orientation,
are connected. The theory holds

Romney picks up steam after
strong first debate showing

Turks hold banners that read "no to war, no to fascism" during a protest in Istanbul Turkey, on Thursday. v
Turkey expands m m1 1 ar
operati ons wiin Syria

Shelling of Turkish
territory prompted
strong retaliation
AKCAKALE, Turkey (AP)
Turkey sanctioned further
military action against Syria
on Thursday and bombarded
targets across the border with
artillery for a second day, rais-
ing the stakes in a conflict that
increasingly is bleeding outside
Syrian territory.
Although both sides moved to
calm tensions, Turkey's parlia-
ment overwhelmingly approved a
bill allowing the military to con-
duct cross-border operations into
Syria-makingelearthat Ankara
has military options that do not
involve its Western or Arab allies.
It was the most dramatic
escalation in tensions between
the countries, which were close
allies before the revolt against
Syrian President Bashar Assad
began in March 2011. Over the
past 18 months, however, Tur-
key has become one of the stron-
gest critics of the Syrian regime,
accusing it of savagery and mas-
sacres against the opposition.
The rebels who are trying to

bring down Assad have used
Turkey as their base, enraging
a regime that accuses foreign
countries of fomenting the
unrest inside Syria.
The spark for the latest hostil-
ity was a mortar shell fired from
Syria that slammed into a house
in the Turkish border village of
Akcakale on Wednesday, killing
two women and three children.
"(The shell) hit my neighbor
next door. His wife, his children
died," villager Bakir Kutlugil
told The Associated Press. "Now
I worry whether the next one
will hit me or my neighbor."
MehmetYasin, anothervillag-
er, said he feared Turkey will get
drawn into more violence. "They
are warring over there anyway.
Why should we battle against
anyone?" he asked.
The Turkish response to the
Syrian shelling was swift - it
fired salvos of artillery rounds
inside Syria, contacted its NATO
allies and convened Parliament
for a vote authorizing further
cross-border military operations
if necessary.
The bill opens the way for uni-
lateral action by Turkey's armed
forces inside Syria. Turkey has
used a similar provision to repeat-

edly attack suspected Kurdish
rebel positions in northern Iraq..
Syria's U.N. envoy said Thurs-
day that his government was
investigating the source of the
cross-border shelling and did not
want any escalation of violence
with Turkey.
Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari
said the Assad regime sent
its "deepest condolences" to
the families of the victims,
but stopped short of an apol-
ogy, pending the outcome of the
investigation. He alsourged Tur-
key to act "wisely, rationally" and
prevent infiltration of "terrorists
and insurgents" and the smug-
gling of arms across the border.
Turkish officials, however,
characterized the statement as
an apology.
Ja'afari said that the return
shelling from Turkey early
Thursday injured two Syrian
army officials.
Syrian opposition figures in
Akcakale, which has a clear sight
line into Syria, said the targets
of Turkey's retaliatory attacks
included at least one tank and
one anti-aircraft gun in the town
of Tal Abyad in Raqqa province,
where the Syrian regime and
rebels are battling for control.

Democrats prepare
for political fallout
from apparent loss
DENVER (AP) - Buoyed by a
powerful debate showing, Mitt
Romney said Thursday he offers
"prosperity that comes through
freedom" to a country struggling
to shed a weak economy. Presi-
dent Barack Obama accused the
former Massachusetts governor
of running from his own rescord
in pursuit of political power.
Both men unleashed new
attack ads in the battleground
states in a race with little more
than a month to run, Obama
suggesting Romney couldn't
be trusted with the presidency,
and the Republican accusing the
president of backing a large tax
increase on the middle class.
The debate reached 67.2 mil-
lion viewers, an increase of 28
percent over the first debate in
the'2008 presidential campaign.
The measurement and infor-
mation company Nielsen said
Thursday that 11 networks pro-
vided live coverage of the debate.
Not even Democrats disputed
that Romney was likely to ben-
efit politically from the debate
Wednesday night in which he
aggressively challenged Obama's
stewardship of the economy and
said his own plans would help
pull the country out of a slow-
growth rut. Still, there was no
immediate indication that the
race would expand beyond the
nine battleground states where
the rivals and their running
mates spend nearly all of their
campaign time and advertising
dollars.
Debate host Colorado is one
of them, and Virginia, where
Romney headed for an evening
speech, is another. So, too, Wis-
consin, Obama's destination for
a mid-day rally. Nevada, Ohio,
Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida
and North Carolina are the oth-
ers.
Among them, the nine states
account for 110 electoral votes
out of the 270 needed to win the

White House, more than enough
to tip the campaign to one man or
the other.
"Victory is in sight," Romney
exulted in an emailed request
for donations to supporters. It
was a show of confidence by a
man hoping for a quick rever-
sal in pre-debate public opinion
polls that showed him trailing
in battleground states as well as
nationally.
Reprising a line from the
debatehetold anaudienceofcon-
servatives in Denver that Obama
offers "trickle-down govern-
ment." He added, "I don't think
that's what America believes in.
I see instead a prosperity that
comes through freedom."
Another possible pivot point in
the campaign neared in the form
of Friday's government report on
unemployment for September.
Joblessness was measured at 8.1.
percent the previous month..
Obama campaigned with the
energy of a man determined
to make up for a subpar debate
showing. Speakingto a crowd not

far from the debate hall, he said
mockingly that a "very spirited
fellow" who stood next to him
onstage Wednesday night "does
not want to be held accountable
for the real Mitt Romney's posi-
tions" on taxes, education and
other issues. "Governor Romney
may dance around his positions,
but if you want to be president
you owe the American people the
truth," he said.
Later, before a crowd of tens
of thousands in Madison, Wis.,
he said Romney wants to cut fed-
eral funding for Public Television
while repealing legislation that
regulates the banking industry
"I just wantto make sure I've got
this straight: He'll get rid of regu-
lations on Wall Street, but he's
going to crack down on Sesame
Street," Obama said.
Taxes were a'particular point
of contention between the two
men, although they were sharply
divided as well on steps the cut
the deficit, on government regu-
lation, on education and Medi-
care.

Jose Eduardo Moreira, a

FIRST GEN

- said the club provides her
with a support network of stu-
dents experiencing the same
uneasiness she felt when she first
arrived at the University.
"We're from schools where a
lot of our students don't usually
come to universities like this,"
Johnson said. "When I first came
I didn't even identify as a first
gen, so this group has been really
helpful."
She said her parents and older
sister encouraged her to pursue
a college education, and she rose
to the challenge, graduating as
valedictorian of her high school
class.
"My parents really pushed me
and my sisters to go to college,"
she said."School was everything."
Johnson said it can be difficult
for first-generation students to
interact in a university setting,
since they aren't accustomed to
the system.
"Financial aid is a hassle
sometimes because no one in
our family has done it before,"
she said. "I know my roommate's
like, 'Yeah my parents edited my
paper for me,' and I'm like 'My
parents would have no idea how
to do that."'
Carson Phillips, an LSA junior
and president of First Gens, said
the club abides by "Three Rs" -
raise awareness, resolve and rec-
ognize.
"We just try to present our
group as a resource for other
students, and support and help
them," Phillips said. "I think one
of the biggest struggles for most
of the first gens is the lack of a
support network."
He said one of the organi-

More recently, Michigan hon-
ored members of the Slippery
Rock football team and ath-
letic department during a game
against Wisconsin in 2010.
The announcement of Slip-
pery Rock scores had long been
a tradition in Michigan Stadium
dating back to 1959 when fans
cheered the school with the
funny-sounding name. The tra-
dition spread to other schools,
and Slippery Rock has played

garnering membership from stu-
dents concerned about a stigma,
noting that of the 1,500 first-
generation undergraduates, only
about 15 regularly come to meet-
ings.
"The University focuses a lot
on diversity on the racial level
and on sexuality and a lot of
different areas," he said. "But I
think that social class and stuff
like that isn't discussed at this
University."
Phillips said the club would
like the University to recognize
that diversity transcends more
than just race or sexual orienta-
tion, and is largely embedded in
socioeconomic status.
Greg Merritt, a senior associate
director for University Housing,
encouraged a first-generation stu-
dent to form the club in 2007. As
a first-generation student himself,
Merrit recalled experiencing the
same problems first-generation
students dotoday.
"I felt it important ... that I
could and should give back to
current first gen students and
hoped that I could offer an expe-
rience that could resonate," Mer-
ritt said.
Elise Harper, the student ser-
vices manager for undergraduate
and graduate programs in the
Political Science department and
a group mentor, said she became
interested in how first gen stu-
dents identify themselves during
her graduate studies at Eastern
Michigan University.
"I've heard many students
say that having First Gens as
a place to go, even if only to lis-
ten, made a difference in their
Michigan experience," Harper
said. "Sometimes (the club) even
helped them make the decision
to stay enrolled when they con-
sidered transferring or leaving
school."

yl Norton said in an interview
that a potential game at Michi-

football is a "bridge between the

"I think it would be a won-

schools that started 35 years ago
and hopefully will continue,"

that a person's multiple identities
are not mutually exclusive and
cannot be examined separately
from each other.
Leading academics, legal
experts and activists invested
in the causes will give presenta-
tions and lectures. Topics range
from "The Right to Know: Public
Documents and How to Access
Them," to "Controlling Deviant
Sex," to "How Criminalization
Affects People Living With HIV
in Ontario."
The conference will also fea-
ture smaller workshops and
panel discussions between lec-
tures. On Saturday, there will be
a catered brunch and film screen-
ing of "HIV is Not a Crime," a
film that investigates laws that
treat HIV-positive individuals
unfairly.
Robert Suttle - a conference

speaker and member of the Sero
Project, a not-for-profit human
rights group working to end the
stigma attached to HIV - said
learning from the presenters
who study other topics has been a
highlightof the conference so far.
"To have other people come
and speak about other issues
that are somehow related, yet
we don't really focus on, is a big
help," Suttle said. "A lot of times
you think you're the only one ...
talking about certain issues."
He said the conference seeks
to unite scholars who focus on
sex issues with those who study
justice issues, which provides a
rare opportunity to learn about
the topics in a new context.
Public Health student Tori
Adams, who works in the Uni-
versity's Sexuality and Health
Lab, said she attended Thurs-
day's lectures because of her
work with sex, social justice and
non-profit organizations.

"Hearing about the political
climate in a bunch of different
areas, I'm disconnected with
what's happening," Adams said.
"I don't really know a lot about
the specific state laws ... but I've
been learning a lot, I've been tak-
ing a lot of notes."
LSA junior Audrey Armit-
age said she came because she is
interested in social justice issues,
as well as sex-positivity, a move-
ment that promotes the accep-
tance of all sexualities. She said
she was particularly inspired
by the "Who's Family?" work-
shop she attended Thursday
which discussed how the 1980s,
the drug wars and HIV shaped
homophobia in the black com-
munity.
"It was just a really, really
good conversation," Armitage
said. "It's good to talk about the
intersectionality of all of these
issues ... about how they all fit
together."

den on campus.
UMSFP oversees a number
of other sustainable food initia-
tives, and it utilizes the Student
Campus Farm as its master's
project. Rackham student Lind-
sey MacDonald, program man-
ager of UMSFP, said the idea for
a campus farm spurred from the
Campus Sustainability Integrat-
ed Assessment, an organization
where students report and make
recommendations on a number
of sustainability issues.
University administrators
initially dismissed the idea of a
student farm due to the amount
of work it would entail, but Mac-
Donald said their persistence
eventually led to the establish-
ment of a farm that educates
students and provides food for
campus dininghalls.
LSA senior Lauren Bariont, a
participant in the class project
that initiated the farm's develop-
ment, worked with MacDonald
to write a grant proposal for the
Planet Blue Student Innovation
Fund, which resulted in $42,000
to open the farm. The money was
contingent on receiving addi-
tional funding for a full-time
farm manager, according to Mac-
Donald.
If the grant money comes
through, it will cover costs like
a hoophouse, equipment and
sheds, butUMSFP is still looking
for a farm manager to begin by

next spring.
UMSFP has also reached out
out to University departments
and faculty members who might
be willing to integrate food sys-
tem education into their classes,
like Joe Trumpey, an associate
professor of natural resources,
who is teaching a class this
semester on sustainable food
design through the Penny W.
Stamps School of Art & Design.
MacDonald said the energy
she and her peers experiences
inspired her to collaborate with
existing food groups on campus.
"The second someone learns
about what is happening with
sustainable food on campus they
are excited about it and they
want to get involved," Macdon-
ald said. "But so many people still
haven't heard."
MacDonald added it's impor-
tant to emphasize the difference
between"hippies" andthose par-
ticipating in farming and envi-
ronmental work.
"Everybody makes decisions
about what they eat every day,"
MacDonald said. "I think it's
a social thing too. I'm trying
to figure out how to get people
engaged that aren't engaged just
based on their interest in dirt."
LSAjuniorClaire Jaffe attend-
ed the event said she is in sup-
portive of a UMSFP's efforts.
"This campus farm is a really
important addition to our Uni-
versity," Jaffe said. "I think it's
a long time coming, I think it
should have happened a long
time ago.

Thirty five people
in six states have
contracted the
infection
NEW YORK (AP) - The
potential scope of the menin-
gitis outbreak that has killed at
least five people widened dra-
matically Thursday as health
officials warned that hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of patients
who got steroid back injections
in 23 states could be at risk.
Clinics and medical centers
rushed to contact patients who
may have received the appar-
ently fungus-contaminated
shots. And the Food and Drug
Administration urged doctors
not to use any products at all
from the Massachusetts phar-
macy that supplied the suspect
steroid solution.
It is not clear how many
patients received tainted injec-
tions, oreven whether everyone
who got one will get sick.
So far, 35 people in six states
- Tennessee, Virginia, Mary-
land, Florida, North Carolina
and Indiana - have contracted
fungal meningitis, and five of
them have died, according to
the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention. All had
received steroid shots for back
pain, a highly common treat-
ment.
In an alarming indication the
outbreak could get a lot bigger,
Massachusetts health officials
said the pharmacy involved,
the New England Compound-
ing Center of Framingham,
Mass., has recalled three lots
consisting of a total of 17,676
single-dose vials of the steroid,
preservative-free methylpred-
nisolone acetate.
An unknown number of
those vials reached 75 clin-
ics and other facilities in 23
states between July and Sep-
tember, federal health officials
said. Several hundred of the
vials, maybe more, have been
returned unused, one Massa-

chusetts official said.
But many other vials were
used. At one clinic in Evansville,
Ind., more than 500 patients got
shots from the suspect lots, offi-
cials said. At two clinics in Ten-
nessee, more than 900 patients
- perhaps many more - did.
The investigation began
about two weeks ago after a
case was diagnosed in Tennes-
see. The time from infection to
onset of symptoms is anywhere
from a few days to a month, so
the number of people stricken
could rise.
Investigators this week
found contamination in a sealed
vial of the steroid at the New
England company, according to
FDA officials. Tests are under
way to determine if it is the
same fungus blamed in the out-
break.
The company has shut down
operations and said it is work-
ing with regulators to identify
the source of the infection.
"Out of an abundance of cau-
tion, we advise all health care
practitioners not to use any
product" from the company,
said Ilisa Bernstein, director of
compliance for the FDA's Cen-
ter for Drug Evaluation and
Research.
Tennessee has by far the
most cases with 25, including
three deaths. Deaths have also
been reported in Virginia and
Maryland.
Meningitis is an inflamma-
tion of the lining of the brain
and spinal cord. Symptoms
include severe headache, nau-
sea, dizziness and fever.
The type of fungal meningi-
tis involved is not contagious
like the more common forms.
It is caused by a fungus often
found in leaf mold and is treated
with high-dose antifungal med-
ications, usually given intrave-
nously in a hospital.
Robert Cherry, 71, a patient
who received a steroid shot at
a clinic in Berlin, Md., about a
month ago, went back Thursday
morning after hearing it had
received some of the tainted
medicine.

"So far, I haven't had any
symptoms ... but I just wanted
to double check with them,"
Cherry said. "They told me to
check my temperature and if
I have any symptoms, I should
report straight to the emergen-
cy room, and that's what I'll do."
The New England company
is what is known as a com-
pounding pharmacy. These
pharmacies custom-mix solu-
tions, creams and other medica-
tions in doses or in forms that
generally aren't commercially
available.
Other compounding pharma-
cies have been blamed in recent
years for serious and sometimes
deadly outbreaks caused by
contaminated medicines.
Two people were blinded
in Washington, D.C., in 2005.
Three died in Virginia in 2006
and three more in Oregon the
following year. Twenty-one
polo horses died in Florida in
2009. Earlier this year, 33 peo-
ple in seven states developed
fungal eye infections.
Compounding pharmacies
are not regulated as closely as
drug manufacturers, and their
products are not subject to FDA
approval.
A national shortage of many
drugs has forced doctors to seek
custom-made alternatives from
compounding pharmacies. The
steroid suspected in the out-
break has been in short supply.
The New England company
at the center of the outbreak
makes dozens of other medical
products, state officials said.
But neither the company nor
health officials would identify
them.
The company said in a state-
ment Thursday that despite the
FDA warning, "there is no indi-
cation of any potential issues
with other products." It called
the deaths and illnesses tragic
and added: "The thoughts and
prayers of everyone employed
by NECC are with those who
have been affected."
A 2011 state inspection of the
Framingham facility gave the
business a clean bill of health.

The windy state
Michigan should implement turbine farms
n Joyfield Township, Mich., plans to build wind turbines have been
met with a bizarre form of resistance. Amid concerns over poten-
tial noise and lowered property values, some residents of Joyfield
protested the turbines' construction by building heliports - small air-
ports just for helicopters - in their backyards. Because wind turbines
cannot be built near heliports, several people applied for permits to build
landing pads on their property. Though property owners have the right
to use their land as they wish, using a loophole to combat the construc-
tion of wind turbines is simply an abuse of the law. Citizens of Joyfield
and the rest of Michigan should consider the statewide benefits of wind
power and other forms of clean energy before exploiting regulations.

Romney's 'morals'

W ednesday night, Mitt
Romney played the mor-
als card. During the
debate, he stated
that the budget
deficit is not just
an economic
issue, but moral
as well. What
Romney was
referring to was
the supposed
moral violation JAMES
of borrowing BRENNAN
money that will
have to be paid
back by future generations. I think
most Americans would agree. It
really isn't OK for the federal govern-
ment to borrow trillions of dollars,
allowing for debt to accrue and pass-
ing the bill onto the next generation.
What I found most compelling about
this statement, however, was the use
of the term "moral."
We're not talking about far-right
religious morals. This morality is one
of simple right and wrong - mor-
als in their most basic sense. I find it
interesting that Romney would ref-
erence morality when talking about
deficit reduction, given his policies
and his choice of running mate.
"The Path to Prosperity," better
known as VicetPresidential nominee
Paul Ryan's budget proposal passed
by House Republicans, calls for mas-
sive cuts to Social Security, Medi-
care, Medicaid and Pell Grants. This
essentially amounts to balancing the
budget on the backs of the poor. In a
recent New York Times article, Lar-
kin Warren, a self-professed "former
welfare mom" told her story of get-
ting through four years of college by

heavily relying on government assis-
tance. She took out student loans,
accepted Pell Grants and used food
stamps. Her road was an arduous one,
but with perseverance, hard work
and a lot of help, she eventually grad-
uated and found gainful employment.
Romney's injection of morality
into the debate will likely go unno-
ticed, but it shouldn't. The plans
that he and his running mate have
put forward are, at best, of question-
able morality. Though Romney and
Ryan both preach "self-reliance" in
accordance with their religious mor-
als, they're largely dodging the ele-
phant in the room. Cutting welfare,
whether it's for students, the elderly,
children or just people down on their
luck, is horrifically immoral. People
need these programs, especially dur-
ing a period of economic crisis - not
just to advance in society, but to get
by day-to-day. If Romney wants to
talk morals, he needs to justify how
he can propose hurting the poor so
badly to balance the budget.
Yes, I realize that paying off
our federal debt would be a moral
achievement. The massive debt we
carry makes our country extremely
vulnerable, as well as weak in diplo-
matic relations. It would be good for
us to be debt-free, or at leastamini-
mally in debt. But we cannot allevi-
ate this problem on the backs of our
poor. The people in this country
who have the hardest lives already
shouldn't be asked to sacrifice even
more when there are other ways to
balance the budget.
As President Obama asserted,
the very wealthiest in America can
afford to pay a little more. I'm not
proposing we balance the budget
purely through increased taxes on
the rich - that isn't moral either.
Plus, it would staunch economic
growth. The facts, however, are
that the richest 1 percent of the
country own more than 40 percent
of the nation's wealth and pay his-
torically low tax rates. Everyone
needs to pay his or her fair share,
especially those who can afford a
little extra. By increasing taxes,
we can begin to cut down our defi-
cit while still providing essential

services to grow the economy.
I commend Romney for bringing
morals into the discussion - morals,
after all, are the basis of law. Rom-
ney's ideas on economic morals,
however, are just plain backward. If
I were President Obama, I'd be sure
to point that out at the next debate,
especially considering the sharp
contrast his economic policies pres-
ent. Romney was the clear winner
of Wednesday night's debate, but
he shouldn't have been. After tak-
ing such extreme positions during
the primary, not to mention a slew
of gaffes and Obama's campaign ads
- which have painted a less than
flattering picture of the former gov-
ernor - I was expecting Romney to
be left in the dust during the first
debate. President Obama, however,
faltered, while Romney pounded his
best talking points home.
The wealthiest
can afford to pay
a little bit more.
Here's a piece of advice for the
president: if he wants to win, he
should remind everyone that the
guy at the other podium wants to
decrease help for the poor. Then he
should ask the American people if
they'd consider someone willing to
do that to be "moral."

As Michigan begins to move to alternative
energy sources (as evidenced by the consid-
eration of Prop 3), citizens must inform them-
selves on the reality of current clean energy
methods. A lack of public knowledge of wind
farms is evident: only 12 percent of respondents
in a Michigan State University Land Policy
Institute survey reported agreement or strong
agreement when asked ifthey considered them-
selves well-informed on the topic. As green
technology improves, concerns regarding the
noise, safety and property value decline associ-
ated with wind energy are often put to rest.
According to Jim Cummings, the execu-
tive director of the Acoustic Ecology Institute,
improvements in turbine designs, including
adaptive controls that allow rotation speed to
be adjusted, have resulted in quieter turbines.
Other manufacturers have begun to incorpo-
rate a nighttime mode, which slows the tur-
bine's speed in order to reduce noise. Duke
Energy Renewables, the company that was
hired to install the turbines in Joyfield, main-
tains that noise is not a problem in modern
wind technology. Further research from the
U.S. Department of Energy suggests that prop-
erty values are not affected by the presence of
turbines, stating that neither the view of wind
turbines nor the distance of the home to such
facilities appear to have a statistically signifi-

cant impact on property value.
While residents should continue to research
and make informed decisions regarding clean
energy, energy companies and local govern-
ments that hire them must do a better job sur-
veying community interest in such projects. In
the case of Joyfield, where residents resorted to
building backyard helicopter pads to stop tur-
bine construction, it's clear that widespread
consent was not sought by contractors. Con-
ducting surveys before embarking on clean
energy initiatives would allow companies
and residents to determine what technology
best fits the community's needs. Public dis-
cussions on pros and cons of wind facilities
could also appropriately gauge interest and
further community knowledge on clean ener-
gy. Open dialogue is key to keeping contrac-
tors and citizens satisfied with community
development and its realities.
As the United States moves toward inde-
pendence from foreign oil, alternative sources
like wind energy are poised to supply power to
more American communities. It's imperative
that citizens continue to educate themselves
on improvements in the field, and express their
concerns in the public forum. Open communi-
cation between companies and the communities
they serve will ensure effective implementation
of fossil fuel's greener alternatives.

Deliberately disenfranchised'

Lies and tall ta

First, a public service announcement:
"Hey black people, old people, poor
people and students! Guess what you
all have in common? Law-
makers are trying to fuck
you in your assholes!" says
Sarah Silverman about
new voter identification
laws in a video introduc-
ing a new initiative, "Let
My People Vote."n
On that note, let's talk
about voter registration. YONAH
In dozens of states, the LIEBERMAN
final day to register to vote
is during this coming week.
In the Michigan it's Tues-
day, Oct. 9. So all the hubbub about new voting
laws and getting people registered is about to
come to a head.
Of the 11 states that have passed strict voter
ID laws since 2005, 10 have been passed by
Republican-controlled legislatures. Their justi-
fication is to crack down on voter fraud. How-
ever, since 2000 there have been only 10 cases
of voter fraud nationally that would've been
prevented by these new laws.
Pennsylvania's state legislature passed a
voter ID law that's currently being challenged
in court. University of Washington political sci-
ence prof. Matt Barreto determined that more
than 1-million Pennsylvania voters - nearly
13 percent of registered voters in the state -
would be taken off the voter rolls for not hav-
ing the right voter ID. On top of that, this law
disproportionately affects black voters.Accord-
ing to a study by Azavea, a geospatial analysis
firm, voters in predominately black precincts
of Philadelphia are 85 percent more likely than
voters in predominately white precincts to lack
state-issued IDs.
New laws in Texas and Kentucky ensure
that students - who reliably vote Democratic -
cannot use their university IDs. But those same
laws allow gun owners - who reliably vote
Republican - to use firearm permits. This was
an explicitly political act.
Stepping back, across 23 states, up to 10 mil-
lion registered Latinos could be taken off voter
rolls, according to a study by the Advancement
Project, a civil rights activist group. This is
for a hodgepodge of reasons: strict photo IDs,
requirements to prove citizenship and purg-
ing the records of alleged non-citizens. Each is
more disgusting than the last.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has the

courage to call these laws out for what they are:
"We call those poll taxes," he said in Houston
on July 10. He was referring to the Jim Crow
laws, which systematically denied blacks in the
South the right to vote inthe early 1900s. Clear-
ly this is just a 21st century version.
On the contrary, the Obama campaign has
made it a priority to register voters. It has done
so by actively shaping its strategies to combat
the new restrictive laws and by seeking out
neighborhoods with historically low voter
turnout and registration. It's also created an
entire website, gottavote.org, devoted to giving
people state-specific information about how to
register and what they need at the polls.
This week, as you walked around campus,
you were probably repeatedly asked if you're
registered to vote - chances are those people
are with organizations trying to get Barack
Obama re-elected.
Provingthe Democrats' greater emphasis on
fair voter registration is as simple as compar-
ing one sentence from the leaders of each party.
From the Republicans: "Voter ID, which
is gonna allow Governor Romney to win
the state of Pennsylvania: done." said Mike
Turzai, Pennsylvania State House majority
leader, after listing a number of legislative
victories for the Republicans.
From the Democrats: "What I want is for
people to vote. And yes, of course we want
people to vote for the President. But that's not
what voter protection is about ... A victory is
when people are casting their ballots." said
Courtney Wheeler, national voter protection
coordinator for Obama for America.
The bottom line is this: While one party is
doing all it can to make it harder for U.S. citi-
zens to vote, the other is pulling out all the stops
to register new voters and keep existing ones on
voter rolls.
Let me be clear. I'm not angry at all people
who identify as Republican and I don't dis-
agree with all ideologies commonly associ-
ated with that party. What I struggle with is
a campaign strategy aimed at undermining
our fundamental ability to participate in the
democratic process.
Voter registration strategy is possibly the
starkest contrast here between Democrats and
Republicans. The future of Americans' basic
right to vote is at stake in November.
To me, the choice is clear.

Wednesday night, about 40-mil-
lion people tuned in to watch
President Barack Obama and
Republican presidential nomi-
nee Mitt Romney duke it out in
the first presidential debate of
the 2012 election. These viewers
watched and listened as Romney
and Obama went back and forth
about their plans for America and
what the future would hold for the
country if they were elected presi-
dent. Obama continually talked
about Romney's supposed plan for
a $5-trillion tax cut, and Romney
responded with accusations that
the president plans on increas-
ing taxes. They argued over what
the government's role should be
in health care and big business
regulation. Numbers and dollar
amounts were being thrown out
left and right by both candidates,
such as Romney claiming Obama's
$716-billion Medicare cut, or
Obama claiming that approximate-
ly 5-million jobs have been created
since he took office. But how many
of these numbers are accurate -
how much of what the candidates
are saying is actually true?
In last night debate were numer-
ous accusations that didn't hold up
after careful investigation. Now,
the only reason I'm aware of this
is because I've been following poli-
tics and the election, and because I
tuned in after the debate on CNN
to watch an analysis and fact-
checking discussion. One claim put
forth by Romney was that there are

23-million people outof work. Upon
further research, it was discovered
that this number isn't completely
correct. According to a fact check
by the Chicago Tribune, Romney
would've had to add together the
number of unemployed people, the
number of people who're employed
part-time but want to work full-
time and people who've completely
stopped looking for jobs. Accord-
ing to a breakdown by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics in August, the
number of officially unemployed
people is 12.5 million - this is also
where we get our figure of 8.1 per-
cent unemployment among eligible
workers.
In order for Romney's claim to
be accurate, he needed to say it
was the number of unemployed
or underemployed, an extreme-
ly misleading omission. Also,
Romney's claim that $716 billion
would be cut from Medicare as a
result of the Affordable Care Act
is false, according to a fact check
by USA Today. Romney's claim
that he wouldn't cut taxes for
the wealthy also turned out to be
inaccurate. And according to USA
Today and Chicago Tribune's fact
checks, Obamacare hasn't actually
reduced costs in health insurance
yet.
So what do viewers of the debate
walk away with when so many of the
things the candidates claim about
themselves, their opponent and
their plans seem to be untrue? Well,
for people who follow the election,

des
keep up with politics, make sure
to get all the information and tune
into the fact checking, maybe they
walk away with a mostly factual
view of what's going on. However,
for the people who tuned into the
debate with little prior knowledge
of the political process, where the
candidates stand and what they've
done, they walk away with an inac-
curate and falsified view of the can-
didates and their claims.
After the debate, a poll from
CBS News revealed that support
for Romney from undecided vot-
ers increased by 12 points, though
other estimates are lower. During
the debate, Romney shied away
from his harsh, conservative view,
which he has been running his
entire campaign on, and adopted
a more centrist attitude. However,
for those who know nothing about
Romney's campaign thus far, this
could result in completely inac-
curate views of his policies, which
have become more and more con-
servative. This affects the polls and
could ultimately affect who wins
the election.
The presidential debate is a dan-
gerous thing for the uninformed.
The sheer number of lies can have
detrimental effects on people who
don't know enough about the elec-
tion and are using the debate as
their ultimate source of informa-
tion about the candidates, policies
that don't align with their own.

In an effort to raise aware-

of creative contributions, Fic-
tion Writers Review and the
University's MFA Program in
Creative Writing will co-host a
literature convention commem-
orating the long-standing liter-
ary accomplishments of native
writers by naming Michigan the
"State of the Book."

The idea behind the sym-
posium began with Jeremiah
Chamberlin, Fiction Writers
Review publisher and associate
director of the University's Eng-
lish department's writing pro-
gram. Chamberlin's desire for
Michigan's creative recognition
stemmed from a desire to influ-
ence young minds and help them
uncover the writers within.
"I hope that there's a moment
where someone hears one of
these 30 authors speak and
thinks, as I did as a teenager,
'that's what I want to do with my

it's inspiring."
The event will kick off with
an introduction from Pulit-

author of best-selling memoir
"A Heartbreaking Work of Stag-

of 826 Valencia, a project devel-
oped to help kids and young

will be able to walk through the
book fair in the lobby of Rack-
ham, a congregation of writers,
publishers and editors promot-
ing literature, their works and
programs in support of literary

acceleration.
"It's so rare to have 15 of the
most important literary presses,
literary journals, editors and
publishing houses all in one
room together in the book fair,"
Chamberlin said. "And that's
really where people can wander
around, and get a feel for what
we're trying to accomplish."
At 3:30 p.m., a panel of jour-
nalists including GQ Features
Editor and Knight-Wallace Fel-
low at the University, Donovan
Hohn, will discuss the future
of journalism and what it will
mean when everything "goes
digital."
"They want to talk about not
just the practical side of what's
going to happen when all this
goes digital: is there room for
both print and pixel, but also,
what'sthe hook, the spark that
sends a journalist across the
world (in search of a story),"
Chamberlin explained.
The day-long celebration will
culminate in an hour-long key-
note conversation with Charles
Baxter, award-winning author
and former director of the Cre-
ative Writing MFA program,
and Pullitzer Prize-winning
author and Detroit native,

Philip Levine. The two, with
their combined background and
interest in Michigan, will hold
a conversation in front of 1,200
individuals, discussing their
personal and professional lives.
"Both Charlie and Phil have
come out of huge generosity,"
Chamberlin said. "The evening
will be a conversation, not a
Q&A. We really want to give
the audience a rare experience
of overhearing a conversation
between friends, about writing,
about life, about politics, about
the state of their careers and the
roots of their careers."
Throughout the day, special
events will be held, such as the
revealing of books and antholo-
gies, author readings and book
signings. The symposium looks
to entice individuals into the
creative world while encourag-
ing and recognizing those that
already run in the circle.
"You can't get more authors,
editors and publishers in one
space at one time and have that
kind of access," Chamberlin
said. "Between the practical side
of who you can encounter, what
you can learn coupled with the
abstract-inspiring element, this
should be very interesting."

Hotel Transylvania is stupid,
lame and, most of all, adorable. It
accomplishes its objective of vali-
dating cartoon
romance, and ***
does so with
pizzaz. And Hotel
though intend-
ed for children,
the eminently AtQuality16
likable charac- and Rave
ters will put a
smile on a per- Sony Pictures
son of any age. Animation
The anima-
tion easily hits the marks of cute
and light. Selena Gomez ("Wiz-
ards of Waverly Place," also of
Bieber ruboff fame), the voice of
Mavy, puts on an astonishingly
good vocal performance for an
actress out of the Disney Starlet
Factory. Critics may enter the
theater very ready to hate her
character's guts, but her voice
has the shine to win them over.
There is little in this movie that
is not over-the-top, but if ter-
ribad cartoon love stories are
your thing, you'll appreciate its
excess.
The entire plot is short enough
to fit in the trailer: Dracula's
(Adam Sandler, "Just Go With
It") wife was killed long ago by
a mob of xenophobic humans,
so he built Hotel Transylvania
as a sanctuary for his daughter
and all monsterkind. Mavy, pre-
dictably, does not want to live
in safety forever - she wants to
interact with humans. Her dad
does everything in his power to
keep her away from civilization.
These efforts explode in his face
on Mavy's 118th birthday, when a
human named Jonathan crashes
her party.
Johnny (Andy Samberg,
"Celeste and Jesse Forever") is a
stereotyped character, there's no
getting around that. But he's the

adventurous and warmhearted,
he is exactly the kind of idiot that
a smart girl with a helicopter
family yearns for. He is an escape,
but more than that, he doesn't
suffocate. He and Mavy immedi-
ately "zing," which is Hotel Tran-
sylvania's form for "fall in love at
first sight." Again: stupid, lame,
adorable.
Invite
'Transylvania'
into your life.
The discrete jokes are honestly
bad, and the emotional transi-
tion of Dracula from paranoid to
accepting is obvious and method-
ical. This movie is a bildungsro-
man for the father figure, not the
daughter: Mavy's father learns,
kicking and screaming, that his'
daughter needs to live on her
own terms, and that the world
might be worthy of her presence
in it. His role as Count Dracula
is an afterthought to his role as a
father.
The supporting cast, an array
of comically animated monsters,
is uniformly corny, and their pur-
pose as a sort of Gaze, or Greek
chorus, is overdone. But their self-
referential charm provides a way
to forgive them, and this movie,
for beingso facepalmingly dumb.
Without a readiness to engage,
and participate in, whatyou know
as idiocy, this movie would have
held no appeal. Be this movie's
friend, and it will be your friend.
Take somneone you're comfortable
with and bond via mutual stupid-
ity. Genndy Tartakovsky's "Hotel
Transylvania" has enough sub-
stance to be worth your time, if
you let it be.

side of Korean Natural Science
entertainment, Auditorium
the University Free
is hosting the
first ever Inde-
pendent Korean Film Festival in
the United States.
The Nam Center and the
University's Screen Arts and
Cultures Department, in asso-
ciation with the Museum of
Modern Art and The Korea
Society, will run the festival Fri-
day through Sunday, Oct. 7 in
the Natural Science Building's
Kraus Auditorium. The event is
free and open to the public.
Sangjoon Lee, a postdoctoral
research fellow in Screen Arts

and Cultures, said the Center
for Korean Studies is supportive
of any kind of cultural event that
showcases the Korean lifestyle.
"I decided to go with indepen-
dent film because independent
film has not been considered
important, not even in South
Korea," Lee said. "I just want
to show the diversity of Korean
cinema."
Lee explained that an inde-
pendent Korean film is produced
outside of the three main pro-
duction studios in South Korea
- CJ Entertainment, Showbox
and Lotte Entertainment, which
are comparable to Paramount,
20th Century Fox and Univer-
sal Studios in the US. Lee said
about 90 percent of South Kore-
an films are produced through
these three studios.
"Many people ... are produc-
ing their own films with (an)
extremely low budget," he said.
"But the ideas and scope and
the styles and their creativity
are many times better than the
mainstream film product."
According to Lee, similar to the
United States, independent films
in South Korea are shown almost
exclusively at film festivals. That's
why he decided to organize this
festival for students at the Uni-
versity who may have never been

Michigan coach Chaka Daley and the Wolverines have another big test upcoming.
Wolverines ready for
talented Penn State .

Freshman shortstop Sierra Romero went 2-for-3 with a game-tying home run against the NFP All-Stars on Friday.
M' s
s e aSgame vs. l- Sars

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
In its first home game since
this spring's Big Ten title-clinch-
ing series against Purdue, the
Michigan softball team returned
to form in an exhibition game
against the National Pro Fast-
pitch All-Star team Thursday
night.
Like last NPF ALL-STAR 2
season, the MICHIGAN 3
Wolverine
freshmen stepped up, as rookie
shortstop Sierra Romero hit a
game-tying two-run home run
in the bottom of the fifth inning.
In the bottom of the seventh with
the bases loaded, NPF pitcher
Jamee Juarez walked in senior
second baseman Ashley Lane
and Michigan won, 3-2. It was
just the second loss in 49 games
in the 'Back to School' tour for
the NPF All-Stars.
The Wolverines had plenty
of offensive production on the
night. Romero headlined the
Michiganoffense, goingaperfect
3-for-3 and finished just a triple
short of the cycle. Junior center
fielder Lyndsay Doyle went3-for-
4 and senior third baseman Amy
Knapp went 2-for-3 as Michigan
tallied total 12 hits.

But the Wolverines' returning
power hitter, sophomore pitcher
Sara Driesenga - who will take
a larger role in the offense after
Michigan lost slugger Amanda
Chidester to graduation - strug-
gled. Driesenga struck out in all
three of her at-bats.
"I'd like to see us hit with run-
ners in scoring position a little
better," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "Some of our key
hitters, I think sometimes you
can think too much, and we had a
couple of our kids doing a little bit
of that. But I was pleased to see
people step in. This is the time
of year you see who's got what it
takes."
Hutchins was very pleased
with her freshmen, but noted
that Driesenga didn't hurl her
best game Thursday. Hutchins
still has plenty of confidence
in her sophomore's all-around
game - "We all know she's a
great hitter," Hutchins said.
Reigning Big Ten Pitcher and
Freshman of the Year sophomore
Haylie Wagner pitched a solid
four innings, and senior Stepha-
nie Speierman and Driesenga
finished up in relief. Wagner
gave up one run on three hits and
Speierman struck out two in her
sole inning of work. Driesenga

recorded the win.
Wagner took a while to find
the strike zone at the begin-
ning of the game, but Michigan's
defense helped her out as the
Wolverines recorded a 1-2-3 first
inning.
"Going into it, I was definitely
nervous, probably the most ner-
vous I've ever been," Wagner
said. "But once the game kept
going, the adrenaline kept going,
and my team had my back the
entire time and just felt great
afterwards."
Thursday's game was the first
competitive game Michigan has
played this fall, and Hutchins
said it was good experience for
the freshmen to play in a higher-
stakes game. Michigan played
five games in the Traverse City
Collegiate Tournament last
weekend.
"It's just good for us to com-
pete," Hutchins said. "This is
such a different environment
than Traverse City ... (a trip
that) is very practice-oriented
and this is very game-oriented.
To practice competing, and to'
do it in a big-game environment,
is a lot like the stretch of our
season when the games matter.
"It was so fun to be on our
field (with) the crowd we had.

It was meant to be a big-game
environment."
The game also featured
Michigan softball alum Nikki
Nemitz, Thursday's starting
pitcher for NPF. Nemitz was an
All-American as a junior and is
a current volunteer assistant for
the Wolverines in addition to
playing for the Chicago Bandits
in the NPF.
Hutchins and Nemitz were
in contact over the summer
when the deal between the
NPF and Michigan was made to
have the All-Stars stop in Ann
Arbor in the fall, and Hutchins
said Nemitz was "so excited" to
return to Alumni Field.
When Nemitz was announced
in the lineup before the game
began, the crowd gave her a
standing ovation to welcome her
back to Ann Arbor.
"This place means a lot to
these kids, and that she's so
excited to come back and be on
this field is really meaningful,"
Hutchins said. "I was excited for
her and excited to see her again.
It really macede m ile when
the crowd gave her the ovation
when she was announced."
Michigan will wrap up its fall
play next Tuesday at Alumni
Field against Eastern Michigan.

The Michigan men's soc-
cer team is looking to carry the
momentum from its last-minute
win against Ohio State into its
game SaturdayagainstPennState.
The Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten,
3-5 overall) managed a spectacu-
lar late goal at midfield from the
foot of freshman Jack Brown in its
overtime con-
test. Penn State Penn State

time period.
The win TV/Radio:
wi BTN
against the
Buckeyes may
be the turning point in this young
season for the Wolverines, as the
month of September had been
characterized by close losses
against four top-25 teams. Michi-
gan coach Chaka Daley has put his
team in contention late in nearly
every game, but in most the Wol-
verines fell short.
Michigan looks to continue
riding high on its first conference
win, while the Nittany Lions aim
to jump back into the national
rankings after- a heartbreaking
loss at home.
"I think that it was important
to get the mental edge (against
Ohio State) and hopefully turn the
page against Penn State," Daley

said.
Both teams will look to build
on a .500 conference record and
a middle-of-the-pack standing in
the Big Ten. The Wolverines have
been able to garner momentum
early in games, outscoring their
opponents 7-3 inthe first half.
That may be a challenge this
weekend, going up against the
conference's best defense. The
Nittany Lions have allowed just
five goals this season, putting
more pressure on Michigan to
create early scoring opportuni-
ties in order to compete with their
stingy back line. Daley says he
believes he'll have the Wolverines
ready for another tough contest.
"We've played a lot of ranked
opponents this season," Daley
said. "It's been tough because
guys have second guessed if we
can get results, even though we've
played well."
The crucial victory against
Ohio State seemingly indicates an
edge in momentum for the Wol-
verines on Saturday. Michigan
will also look for the continued
support of the rowdy Ultras, the
Michigan student section, who
rushed the field after last week-
end's overtime thriller.
"The expectation when you're
at home is to win," Daley said.
"There's so much energy and the
Michigan Ultras are always in full
effect."
'The Wolverines will look for
the same energy that carried the
squad over the Buckeyes, as they
hope to turn their hard-fought
efforts against quality opponents
into the positive results Daley has
been lookingfor.

Looking to remain undefeated
at home, the No. 15 Michigan field
hockey team will take on No. 10
Northwestern on Friday at Ocker
Field in Ann Arbor.

The Wol-
verines hope
to carry the
momentum
from last week-
end's 7-1 drub-
bing of Pacific.
In that game,
Michigan took
numerous shots
on goal, with
the final tally
of seven goals
on 31 shots. The

sion has the confidence of the
young team riding high as it heads
into BigTenplay.
"I definitely think it's impor-
tant for everyone to have their
confidence scoring and knowing
that we can work together and put
the ball into the net," said junior
forward Michelle Roberts.
Against Pacific, the Wolverines
were able to practice new strate-
gies as well as give younger play-
ers time on the field.
"We'll try to build on that for
next weekend," said Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz. "Getting
a lot of players in the game, espe-
cially getting some experience at
different positions."
Inadditiontobuildingonexpe-
rience, Michigan hopes to contin-
ue its barrage of shots on goal and
its aggressive mentality.
"I think if we go out with
that attitude and mentality and
keep fighting, fighting, fight-
ing, because they are going to
be determined against us so we
1

have to fight hard and hopefully
get another 31 shots on goal,"
said freshman midfielder Aisling
Naughton.
But it won't be an easy task.
Northwestern stands as one of the
nation's best teams and will pose a
big challenge for the Wolverines.
The Wildcats are coming off an
overtime victory over No. 6 Penn
State last weekend and the Wol-
verines lost to the Nittany Lions
in their Big Ten opener, 4-3.
Michigan's impact player,
junior forward Rachael Mack,
will be called upon to lead the
scoring charge for the Wolver-
ines. Mack has scored in seven-
straight games with 11 goals over
that stretch. She is currently
ranked fifth in all-time scoring for
Michigan with 44 goals to date.
Mack, a team captain as well as
a two-time All American, will be
asked to lead this young Michigan
team once again against a high-
caliber opponent.
Due to the recent low-scoring
games against Northwestern,
redshirt junior goalie Haley Jones
will likely have a big impact on
the game. Jones, who has started
all 11 games this season, is hold-
ing opponents to 1.58 goals per
game. As a team captain, Jones
has upped her game against top
opponents this year with a career-
high 14 saves in the loss against
Penn State. Michigan has had the
upper hand against Northwest-
ern in recent years. Dating back
to 1997, the Wolverines have won
20 straight matches against the
Wildcats. Last year's game was a
double overtime thriller in Evan-
ston, which Michigan won 3-2.
In addition to trying to stay
unbeaten at home, the Wolver-
ines will also try to gain their first
conference win when they host
Northwestern.

Breakdown: Blue will answer
questions against Purdue

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Things happen when you're a
football team with a .500 record
or when you've committed six
turnovers in your most recent
game. Things like being just a
three-point favorite against Pur-
due.
The unranked Michigan foot-
ball team's first Big Ten game
looks a lot more questionable than
it did four weeks ago when it was
ranked No. 8. It's not just the two
losses this early in the season,
losses that came against two top-
10 teams. It's not the record so
much as how the Wolverines have
arrived at that record.
At times, the defensive line has
been gashed in the running game
and the offensive line has been
bullied.
Michigan has missed too many
assignments and turned the ball
over too many times. Last year's
glut of turnovers for the defense
has turned into a famine. Redshirt
junior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint has stalled.
Yet despite it all, a wide-open
and talent-deficient Big Ten beck-
ons. The Wolverines remain one
of the favorites to win the con-
ference, but the gap between the
Michigans and the Purdues of the.
Big Ten world is as close as its ever
been.
Michigan pass offense vs. Pur-
due pass defense
In the pass game, Michigan can
expect quite a different look than
it saw against Notre Dame. That
cannot possibly be a bad thing for
the Wolverines.
Two weeks ago, the Fighting
Irish defense pressured senior
quarterback Denard Robinson
into four consecutive intercep-
tions. On three of those intercep-
tions, Robinson was hurried or
knocked down, and was hustled
into poor decisions. (His final
interception was a Hail Mary).
Purdue tends to not bring pres-
sure at all, though defensive tackle
Kawann Short, who averages a
sack per game, can wreak havoc
all by himself. Instead, the Boil-
ermakers will rely on its talented
secondary to shut down Michi-
gan's receivers while Robinson
enjoys time in the pocket.
Cornerback Josh Johnson
should shut down any Michi-
gan receiver he covers - he has
recorded two of the team's eight
interceptions this season - and
there isn't much drop off in the
rest of the secondary. Robinson's
best option will likely be freshman

tight end Devin Funchess who
should exploit Purdue linebackers
that have struggled in coverage.
Notre Dame and Marshall had
success through the air against
Purdue this year, combining for
763 passing yards, mainly because
the Boilermakers couldn't get to
the quarterback. Still, Michigan
has a lot to prove in the passing
game. The edge goes to the team
that has generated plenty of inter-
ceptions this year.
Edge: Purdue
Michigan rush offense vs. Pur-
due rush defense
The Purdue rush defense
begins and ends with Short, who
commands attention from the
offensive line. Other than Short,
though, Michigan has the advan-
tage.
Robinson should have success
on designed runs, but the lack of
blitzes frees up Purdue lineback-
ers to spy and limit Robinson's
scrambling ability.
Toussaint's production could
dictate the outcome of the game.
Last week's game showed the
effects of shying away from the
run on the road. Michigan must
control the edge and spring Tous-
saint.
Edge: Michigan
Purdue pass offense vs. Michi-
gan pass defense
The big question mark entering
Saturday's game is the status of
quarterback Robert Marve
Marve tore his ACL for the
third time of his career in the
fourth quarter against Notre
Dame on Sept. 8. Purdue coach
Danny Hope said that he "couldbe
ready" for Saturday's game.
Caleb TerBush has played in
Marve's absence, as he did for
much of last season, and he has
performed solidly, if unspectacu-
larly.
TerBush has completed nearly
64 percent of his passes for seven
touchdowns and 531 yards, with
four interceptions. But as Michi-
gan and its five consecutive inter-
ceptions against Notre Dame can
attest, four interceptions isn't too
bad. Whoever gets the start will
have plenty of speedy options at
wide receiver. Antavian Edison
(24 receptions, 285 yards and five
touchdowns) is the main target,
though O.J. Ross has hauled in 27
receptions and Gary Bush adds
four touchdowns.
The screen is the staple of the
Purdue offense, though. They
love slip screens. They love tunnel
screens. They love bubble screens.

That puts pressure on the sec-
ondary to make tackles in space
against some shifty ball carriers,
something it has struggled to do
this year.
Edge: Push
Purdue rush offense vs. Michi-
gan rush defense
Michigan's line play has been
frustrating this year. Purdue's has
too.
Despite the mediocre play in
the trenches, Purdue averages
more than 200 yards per game on
the ground, largely due to running
back Akeem Shavers, who aver-
ages 4.1 yards per carry.
The Boilermakers' rushing
stats become much less impres-
sive when you take out the 392-
yard anomaly against Eastern
Michgian. Purdue gained just 90
yards on the ground against Notre
Dame, for example, significantly
less than Michigan's total against
the Fighting Irish.
The Michigan defense has been
slowly improving and had its best
showing of the seasons last week.
A forgettable Purdue rushing
attack won'treverse the trend.
Edge: Michigan
Special teams
Remember that Short guy? He
even dominates on special teams.
Short has blocked a mind-
blowing three kicks in just four
games this year, adding to the two
he blocked in 2010 and the one he
blocked in 2011. Purdue's place
kickers are even less tested than
Michigan's. Sam McCartney and
Paul Griggs have each made the
only kicks they've attempted.
Return man Raheem Mostert
has struggled to get going this sea-
son, averaging less than 23 yards
per return. Last year he averaged
10 yards more per return and a
scored touchdown.
Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
Michigan has many questions
to answer on Saturday. How will it
respond to the tough loss to Notre
Dame? Can it play well on the
road? Will Toussaint be a factor?
The bye week helps. Plus,
Michigan recognizes its road
struggles and has taken steps to
correct past mistakes. The Wol-
verines' goal is always a Big Ten
title, and that campaign starts
Saturday.
Michigan gets the edge.
Edge: Michigan

the hazing didn't bother him too

that similar kinds of treatment

Berenson instituted a policy

Sitting in prime position to
make a run for the conference
championship, the No. 23 Michi-
gan women's soccer team has
taken the Big Ten by surprise this
season.

in three years.
But overshadowed by Michigan's
remarkable back four and its
opportune offense is a solid mid-
field that has been instrumental
inthe team's success:
The Wolverines' midfield has
already accounted for eight goals
and nine assists, but its confident
style of play has provided the big-
gest boost to the team. Anchored
by fifth-year senior Clare Sta-
chel and junior Meghan Toohey,
the middle four sets up offensive
attacks, supports the defense and
effectively controls the pace of
the game.
Perhaps the most exciting
member of Michigan's midfield
is sophomore Christina Murillo.
Since her return from the under-

20 women's World Cup in Japan,
Murillo has tallied only one goal
and one assist, but contributes
to the team in ways that aren't
reflected on a statsheet. The
sophomore controls the ball like
a professional, makes pinpoint
passes from 30 yards away and
has surprised many goalkeepers
with long-range, powerful shots.
And she does it all with a soft-
spoken humility.
"I don't care how many goals I
score, as long as the team is win-
ning," Murillo said.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
knows that having a player like
Murillo is rare. After she scored
the game-winning tally against
Oakland on Sept. 9, Ryan said he
felt like Murillo was playing at a
level above everyone else: faster,
stronger and smarter.
"I don't see many college play-
ers playing the way she is right
now," Ryan said. "She's not play-
ing like a college student - she's
playing like a pro."
The Wolverines face North-
western on Saturday on the road
knowing that if they don't win,
they risk dropping further behind
conference-leading Penn State.
The fourth-ranked Nittany Lions
(5-0,11-2) are perched atop the Big
Ten with 15 points. Despite being
undefeated in conference play,
Michigan trails by two points
because of a draw with Iowa.
The Wolverines have never
finished first in the Big Ten, but
Murillo hopes to change that this
fall.

"We're performing to the best
of our abilities right now," Muril-
lo said. "Our biggest goal is to win
the Big Ten championship."
Halfway through the confer-
ence schedule, Michigan is poised
to do just that. The midfield has
controlled the tempo of every
match, and its ball movement and
precise passes have worn down
opponents. It will look to assert its
dominance in the remaining Big
Ten games, but that won't be easy.
Standing in their way on Saturday
are the Wildcats, who have not
lost to the Wolverines since 2005.
This year, Northwestern is
struggling to find the back of the
net, but has improved since last
year. The Wildcats (0-5, 4-7-2)
have already doubled its 2011 win
total.
Northwestern's attack, led by
junior forward Kate Allen, has
only scored once in five confer-
ence matches, but the Wildcats'
solid defense has kept them in
almost every game this season.
Breaking them down will pres-
ent a challenge for Michigan's
midfield, but Murillo knows how
much a win would mean for the
team.
"Beating (Northwestern)
this weekend would prove how
much the soccer program has
improved," Murillo said.
Facing a conference opponent
on the road is never easy, espe-
cially in a must-win scenario. But
the Wildcats are a college team.
And, according to Ryan, Murillo
just isn't at that level.
