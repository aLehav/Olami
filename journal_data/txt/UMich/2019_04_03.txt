The second Democratic 
presidential debate will be 
hosted in Detroit on July 
30 and 31. The Democratic 
National 
Convention 
approved 12 debates, which 
will start in June 2019.
The 
DNC 
told 
the 
Detroit 
Free 
Press 
the 
primary 
debate 
will 
host 
approximately 
20 
candidates including Bernie 
Sanders, 
Kamala 
Harris, 
Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker, 
Kirsten 
Gillibrand 
and 
Elizabeth Warren. 
DNC 
Chairman 
Tom 
Perez told the Detroit Free 
Press the debate is being 
held in Detroit because of 

the character of the city.
“Detroit 
embodies 
the 
values and character of the 
Democratic 
Party,” 
said 
Perez. “It’s a city of grit and 
determination, a city that 
has gotten knocked down, 
only to get back up stronger 
… Detroit is the perfect 
place for our party’s second 
debate.”

Camille 
Mancuso, 

LSA 
sophomore 
and 
communications director for 
the University of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 
College 
Democrats, 
said 
the debate in Detroit is a 
reflection of the state of 
Michigan’s important role in 
the upcoming election.

In the first meeting of 
the 
Ninth 
Assembly, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Central Student Government 
elected 
15 
members 
to 
different positions on the new 
assembly. CSG President Ben 
Gerstein, LSA sophomore, and 
CSG Vice President Isabelle 
Blanchard, LSA junior, were 
officially sworn into their 
positions and gave their first 
executive communications of 
the semester.
The meeting began with 
Gerstein, Blanchard and new 
members of the Assembly 

taking the Oath of Office. 
In the March 27 to 28 CSG 
election, 
Gerstein 
and 
Blanchard 
won 
executive 
seats as president and vice 
president, respectively. Both 
Gerstein and Blanchard ran 
with the Engage Michigan 
Party, which also elected 
31 
individuals 
to 
CSG 
representative positions.
The Assembly then settled 
a 
tie 
between 
Education 
junior Cameron Keuning and 
Education junior Isra Elshafei 
for the School of Education 
representative, 
ultimately 
choosing Elshafei by a secret 
ballot vote. Both candidates 
had the opportunity to speak 

to the Assembly for two 
minutes about why they chose 
to run as a representative.
Keuning said he decided to 
run after discovering no one 
was running for the position.
“I want to do this because 
I want to serve the other 
(School 
of 
Education) 
students 
because, 
like 
myself, they wouldn’t have 
gotten represented in this 
body,” Keuning said. “I like 
to hold high the democratic 
values that Central Student 
Government 
also 
holds 
up (and) to represent my 
fellow students and to serve 
them, just as you do to your 
classmates.”

Elshafei, who was unable 
to 
attend 
the 
meeting, 
wrote 
in 
a 
statement 
to 
the Assembly she believes 
the 
School 
of 
Education 
is 
underrepresented 
on 
campus and would love the 
opportunity to represent the 
school through CSG.
“I 
am 
an 
Afro-Arab 
American 
who 
was 
born 
and raised in Ann Arbor to 
immigrant parents, so I was 
raised to be a Wolverine,” Elshafei 
wrote. “Truthfully, it was a little 
disheartening to see that there 
were not any candidates running 
for the position for the School’s 
assembly representative. 

University of Michigan alum 
Lori Lightfoot won Chicago’s 
mayoral race Tuesday night, 
making her the first Black 
woman to be elected to the 
position. 
With 
Lightfoot’s 
victory, Chicago is now on track 
to become the largest U.S. city 
with an openly gay mayor.
Lightfoot, a former federal 
prosecutor, 
beat 
out 
Toni 
Preckwinkle, 
Cook 
County 
Board president, in a landslide 
victory. The two emerged from 
a field of a dozen candidates to 
compete in Tuesday’s runoff 
election.
Lightfoot, who has never 
held elected office, said she 
looked forward to taking on 
the role, noting Preckwinkle’s 
efforts to portray her as a 
political novice.
“I feel very humbled and 
honored,” Lightfoot said. “I’m 
going to do everything I can to 
earn it. We were hoping, based 
on our polling, that we would do 
really well. But, this is amazing. 
More than I ever dreamed of.”

In March, the Southern 
Poverty Law Center’s released 
its annual Hate Group Report. 
Each year, the nonprofit civil 
rights organization releases 
a report on groups engaging 
in incisive or hateful political 
activity in the United States. 
This year, 31 Michigan-based 

organizations were identified 
for white supremacist, anti-
Muslim, anti-LGBT or general 
hate activity, including one 
group from Ann Arbor — 
the American Freedom Law 
Center. 
The AFLC, a conservative 
law firm, was listed for its 
anti-Muslim 
stance, 
along 
with 
groups 
such 
as 
the 
Sharia Crime Stoppers and the 

Southeast Michigan Tea Party. 
Ann Arbor lawyer Robert 
Muise, the co-founder and 
senior counsel for the AFLC, 
identifies 
as 
a 
“devout 
Catholic,” and his colleague and 
co-founder, David Yerushalmi, 
practices Orthodox Judaism. 
The two attorneys collectively 
founded 
the 
AFLC 
in 
January of 2012 after several 
years 
of 
collaborating 
on 

Constitutional 
law 
cases 
regarding issues such as free 
speech and abortion.
Following its foundation, the 
AFLC gained negative media 
attention as early as 2013 for 
representing 
conservative, 
anti-immigrant 
organizations 
such as the American Freedom 
Defense Initiative.

On Tuesday afternoon, 
while 
pro-Israel 
and 
Jewish student groups held 
their annual Israel Day 
on the Diag event, about 
15 students in support of 
Palestine gathered in the 
corner of the Diag and held 
a Palestinian flag. The Diag 
Day is centered around 
the celebration of Israel, 
but dissenters arrived to 
represent Palestine. The 
event prompted a passerby 
to call the Division of 
Public Safety and Security, 
despite 
the 
gathering 
remaining peaceful.
An LSA junior, who asked 
to remain anonymous for 
fear of being placed on 
anti-Palestinian blacklists, 

said the gathering was not 
formally 
planned, 
with 
word spreading through 
group chats. He said it 
was intended to serve as a 
reminder of the Palestinian 
people and the oppression 
they have suffered.
“There 
wasn’t 
much 
mobilization to this, there’s 
no affiliation with any org 
— it’s just that we wanted 
to be here to reaffirm 
Palestine’s existence, its 
people’s 
existence, 
the 
struggle, the oppression, 
the occupation,” he said.
Information sophomore 
Sofia 
Levinson 
serves 
as the Israel community 
coordinator 
for 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Hillel, a Jewish student 
group 
on 
campus, 
and 
organized 
the 
event. 

Levinson said the event 
this 
year 
highlighted 
Israeli 
elections 
and 
provided an opportunity 
for students to write their 
hopes for their futures on 
sheets of paper, which will 
be placed in the Western 
Wall in Jerusalem, a sacred 
site for Jews.
According to Levinson, 
Israel Day is a way to bring 
people together. She also 
acknowledged there are 
diverse opinions of Israel.
“We wanted to celebrate 
Israel, and we also have 
a 
table 
where 
we’re 
hoping for a better Israel 
in the future as well, 
so 
acknowledging 
that 
there are many different 
opinions 
of 
Israel,” 
Levinson said. “I think 
that any country can hope 
to improve in the future, 
so 
we 
also 
recognize 
that there is room for 
improvement.”
Despite 
this 
attempt 
to bring people together 
to celebrate Israel, many 
students 
supporting 
Palestine 
expressed 
frustration at the event.
One LSA sophomore sat 
at the side of the Diag to 
remind those celebrating 
Israel Day of the human 
rights violations against 
Palestinians. The student 
also 
asked 
to 
remain 
anonymous for fear of 
getting blacklisted.
“Never let them feel 
like there’s nothing going 
on over there,” he said. 
“They 
can 
peacefully 
put up that flag with no 
conflict at all, as if it’s 
a 
completely 
peaceful 
country 
that’s 
done 
nothing wrong. Because 
the 
human 
rights 
violations are going on 
every second, and people 
here today need to make 
that known to everyone.”

Tilly 
Shames 
is 
the 
executive director of U-M 
Hillel. Shames said she 
thinks it is positive that 
pro-Palestinian 
students 
gathered on the Diag. She 
said pro-Israel groups have 
done the same in the past.
“I 
think 
it’s 
positive 
that there are Palestinian-
identified students that are 
here, and I don’t see them 
interacting 
negatively 
with 
the 
students 
that 
are 
celebrating 
Israel,” 
Shames said. “I see them 
here to provide support for 
their peers, possibly. When 
we at Hillel see that there 
is an anti-Israel display 
on the Diag, often we will 
come so that students who 
are triggered by something 
that they see as anti-Israel, 
those students can come to 
us when they’re concerned 
or 
upset 
about 
what 
they’re seeing. I see this 
pro-Palestinian group as 
offering the same for their 
community.”
Shames said the pro-
Palestinian group did not 
disrupt 
the 
celebration, 
and she does not view the 
gathering as a protest.
DPSS received a call 
from 
a 
student 
that 
reported 
there 
was 
a 
confrontation 
between 
student groups. However, 
DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Melissa Overton said there 
did not appear to be an 
issue. 
Additionally, 
pro-
Palestinian students said 
the decision to hold Israel 
Day 
three 
days 
after 
the 
murder 
of 
several 
Palestinian 
civilians 
showed what they claim 
to be hypocrisy and a lack 
of willingness to engage in 
real dialogue.

STUDE NTS SHARE DE I IDE A S

ON THE DAILY: SNL OFFERS ‘U’ MUG SHOT

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: HEALTH SERVICE TO OFFER 
FREE, ANONYMOUS AIDS TESTING

Over 
the 
weekend, 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 
mug was spotted on the 
late night television show 

“Saturday Night Live.”
The March 30 episode 
was hosted by Sandra Oh. 
The University mug made its 
special appearance during a 
skit in which cast members, 
featuring cast member Kate 

McKinnon, along with Oh, 
sat together around a table 
in an office kitchen setting. 
The mug was placed in front 
of McKinnon, and remained 
visible during the entirety 
of the skit.

Though 
neither 
the 
mug 
nor 
the 
University 
received any special shout 
out, questions have been 
raised regarding the reason 
behind featuring the maize 
and blue prop on the show.

In response to rising concern, 
University Health Service will 
offer 
anonymous 
testing 
for 
acquired 
immune 
deficiency 
syndrome beginning next week.
Health Service Director Caesar 
Briefer said that, with anonymous 
testing, he expects the number of 
AIDS tests the service administers 
to increase dramatically. 

Currently, Health Service tests 
about 30 people a week.
Health Service developed the 
anonymous testing service to 
remove some of the fear of being 
identified with a high-risk group 
for AIDS. 
“There’s clearly a fair amount 
of sensitivity regarding this issue,” 
Briefer said.
AIDS testing at Health Service 

includes two blood tests which 
screen for the AIDS antibody. 
The testing is free for students but 
costs $35 for others. 
Students will have to identify 
themselves for the anonymous 
testing by showing an ID card 
or by putting the card in a cover 
which would show their eligibility 
but hide their name.
Anonymous testing is used in 

many clinics, Briefer said, but is 
not available in Washtenaw
County or through most health 
services. 
Fourteen people are infected 
with the AIDS virus in Washtenaw 
County, including one University 
student, according to Briefer.
Briefer said the anonymous 
testing program has been in the 
works for months.

Diag event celebrating Israel Day 
draws pro-Palestinian students

Annual commemoration of declaration of Israeli statehood prompts opposition

blacklists, 
called 
the 
decision “unconscionable.”
“The state of Israel killed 
four Palestinians — three 
of them were under the 
age of 18,” she said. “They 
did that on Saturday, and 
today is Tuesday, and we’re 
celebrating the state that 
murdered four people just 
a few days ago… So even 
though I understand that 
this is an annual event, the 
audacity for them to still 
organize this event within 
that context, when Israel 
and IDF (Israel Defense 
Forces) 
soldiers 
have 
been killing paramedics, 
children, 
amputees, 
people 
with 
disabilities, 
mothers, 
just 
blatantly 
and so aggressively within 
the 
past 
year 
is 
just 
unconscionable to me.”
Another pro-Palestinian 
student, a recent University 
alum 
who 
identifies 
as 
Jewish and asked to remain 

anonymous 
for 
fear 
of 
blacklists, said he believes 
the event worked to silence 
Palestinians.
“Obviously 
you 
have 
to book the Diag well in 
advance — I don’t blame 
(Israel 
Day 
organizers) 
for coming out today, I 
just think it’s a little bit 
hypocritical, 
because 
when 
SAFE 
(Students 
Allied for Freedom and 
Equality) has events on the 
Diag, basically whenever 
SAFE does anything, that 
side calls them out for 
insensitivity or brings up 
recent events, that in some 
cases 
happened 
weeks 
beforehand,” he said. “So, 
for (Israel Day organizers) 
to be here so soon after 
four civilians were killed, it 
just shows that’s not really 
what they care about. They 
don’t care about sensitivity 
— they care about silencing 
Palestinians.”

In 2013, the AFDI sued King 
County, Washington, for refusing 
to post a bus advertisement titled 
“The Faces of Global Terrorism.” 
Another branch of the AFDI 
called “Stop Islamization of 
America,” 
had 
already 
been 
blocked 
from 
attempting 
to 
post similar advertisements a 
year earlier in New York City’s 
subway system.
By 2015, the case was brought 
to the Ninth Circuit Federal 
Court of Appeals, where Muise 
and Yerushalmi claimed the 
AFDI had the First Amendment 
right to advertise its views freely. 
Following the court’s siding 
with King County, the AFLC 
attempted to appeal and take 
the case to the Supreme Court, 
though their request to be heard 
by the court was rejected 7-2 in 
2016. 
Within the SPLC, Yerushalmi 
is listed as “a key figure in 
the 
U.S. 
anti-Muslim 
hate 
movement,” 
and 
has 
been 
monitored by the SPLC for the 
past several years. According to 
SPLC Communications Director 
Rebecca Sturtevant, the group 
has 
gathered 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
information 
on 
Yerushalmi and his legal and 
political activity.
In a 2017 video interview 
cited by the SPLC, Yerushalmi 
explicitly 
stated 
his 
views 
toward the Muslim community 
and its presence in America.
“I don’t have a problem saying 
that 
Western 
cultural 
and 
civilization is simply supreme,” 
Yerushalmi said. “It’s superior 
to that which is conquered, 
and I have no problem with 
saying that Islamic culture 
is 
violent, 
it’s 
misogynist, 
it’s 
discriminatory 
and 
it’s 
backward, and all I have to do 
is point to the entire Muslim 
world.”
According 
to 
the 
SPLC, 
Yerushalmi is also the founder 
of the Society of Americans 
for National Existence, which 
was established in the wake of 

the 9/11 attacks and promoted 
the idea that Islamic religious 
law is “a criminal conspiracy 
to 
overthrow 
the 
U.S. 
government.”
The AFLC’s work for anti-
immigrant 
causes 
and 
its 
founders’ anti-Muslim views 
brought 
it 
to 
the 
SPLC’s 
attention. Following the SPLC’s 
report 
released 
in 
March, 
Michigan 
Attorney 
General 
Dana Nessel established a unit 
to investigate and prosecute 
Michigan 
organizations 
perpetuating 
hate 
crimes. 
Muise is currently in the midst 
of ongoing litigation with Nessel 
and the Michigan Department 
of Civil Rights over the unit.
After filing an initial lawsuit 
on Feb. 28, the AFLC filed its first 
amended complaint on March 
12 against Nessel and MDCR 
Director Agustin Arbulu. The 
legal document cited First and 
14th Amendment violations in 
Nessel and Arbulu’s conduct 
toward the AFLC in recent 
weeks.
According to Muise, while 
the hate crimes unit has yet to 
prosecute the AFLC for hate 
crimes, Nessel’s inclusion of the 
AFLC as a potential hate group 
represents 
an 
infringement 
on the group’s Constitutional 
freedoms.
“(The 
attorney 
general’s 
office) is a government agency 
that 
has 
law 
enforcement 
authority, 
targeting 
us 
as 
engaging in illegal conduct 
against minority organizations,” 
Muise said. “Now that the state 
is involved, the government is 
involved, that’s triggered our 
constitutional 
protections. 
And we seek to protect those 
in federal court by a court 
declaration that protects us, 
that keeps us from being a target 
of the attorney general and the 
Department of Civil Rights.”
According to Muise, none of 
AFLC’s past or current actions 
would 
justify 
prosecutorial 
measures by the Office of 
the Attorney General. As he 
explains, the AFLC classifies 
itself as “a public interest law 

firm defending the rights of 
those 
who 
promote 
Judeo-
Christian values.”
Regarding the case against 
the state of Michigan, however, 
Muise 
argues 
that 
defense 
of 
civil 
liberties 
against 
government 
infringement 
remains the sole rationale of the 
AFLC’s legal argument.
“I took an oath as a marine 
officer to support and defend 
the Constitution against all 
enemies foreign and domestic 
and that’s what I do,” Muise 
said. “And right now, I consider 
the Michigan AG’s office to be 
a domestic enemy, because of 
what they’re doing in violating 
our Constitutional rights.”
Furthermore, Muise claims 
the 
MDCR 
and 
attorney 
general’s use of information 
from the Southern Poverty Law 
Center is not only inaccurate, 
but represents a problematic use 
of information from a partisan 
group by a government agency.
“You 
have 
the 
attorney 
general, 
who’s 
weaponizing 
that office in a way that they’re 
targeting political opponents,” 
Muise said. “So now in the mind 
of the public, the American 
Freedom 
Law 
Center 
is 
a 
criminal organization operating 
here in Michigan, and that’s just 
plainly wrong, it’s illegal for the 
government to do that.”
The AFLC built on this 
argument in its first amended 
complaint, writing, “Defendants 
and SPLC are conspiring and 
working 
jointly 
to 
promote 
SPLC’s 
radical 
political 
agenda, by targeting political 
opponents, such as plaintiff, 
for investigations, surveillance, 
public 
condemnation, 
public 
scorn, 
and 
other 
efforts 
designed to harm their work.”
In response to the accusations 
against the attorney general, 
state 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, said the AFLC’s 
decision to sue the state was 
not a surprise, considering the 
group’s past actions and the 
progressive goals outlined by 
the MDCR.
“It’s not surprising to me 

that an organization like the 
American Freedom Law Center 
or other far-right organizations 
would attack them, because 
what they’re doing is actually 
protecting 
marginalized 
communities,” 
Rabhi 
said. 
“They’re protecting people of 
color, they’re protecting the 
LGBTQ community and these 
are people that these groups 
are coming after actively. If you 
have an organization like the 
Michigan Department of Civil 
Rights and the Civil Rights 
Commission that’s helping to 
protect them, of course they’re 
going to come after them.”
Rabhi explained that the 
AFLC’s legal action against 
Nessel 
not 
only 
represents 
opposition to the progressive 
measures 
she 
has 
pursued 
during the first three months of 
her term, but also demonstrates 
opposition 
to 
the 
potential 
for social change her recent 
election proved to the people of 
Michigan.
“They also came after our 
attorney general as well, Dana 
Nessel, who is the first openly 
LGBT attorney general of our 
state, and so of course they’re 
going after her,” Rabhi said. “She 
is a champion of the people, she’s 
done amazing work already in 
the first three months, standing 
up for the people of this state 
and protecting people’s rights. 
It’s not surprising that far-right 
organizations would come after 
her and sue her in her pursuit of 
having a more just and equitable 
society here in the state of 
Michigan.”
AFLC’s lawsuit against the 
attorney general and MDCR 
made reference to several state 
and federal statutes permitting 
free expression and open legal 
representation.
Law student Kevin Deutsch 
explained the basis of the 
AFLC’s lawsuit against the 
attorney general’s office, as set 
out in the organization’s first 
amended complaint.

“I think obviously our 
organization has talked a 
lot about how Michigan 
is going to be a really 
important state in the 2020 
election,” Mancuso said. 
“And I think that having 
the debate in Detroit is 
just another example of 
politicians recognizing the 
importance 
of 
Michigan 
and a lot of Midwestern 
states 
for 
the 
2020 
elections.”
Mancuso also noted the 
significance of holding the 
debate in Detroit, a city 
with a history of economic 
issues important to many 
Democrats.
“Specifically 
having 
it 
in Detroit I think is going 
to 
be 
really 
exciting,” 
Mancuso 
said. 
“Detroit 
is a city that has been hit 
pretty hard with a lot of 
economic 
struggles 
and 
there are a lot of issues 
that are really prevalent to 
the people of Detroit that 
I think will be brought up 
by Democrats during the 
debates so it’s going to be 

really interesting how that 
all works out.”
LSA 
junior 
Kate 
Nachazel, vice president 
of the University’s chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 
echoed Mancuso’s points 
of Michigan being a key 
state in the 2020 election. 
Nachazel also said she was 
glad to see an opportunity 
for Detroit residents to gain 
attention in the election.
“I’m excited about it,” 
Nachazel 
said. 
“There 
was one in Detroit for the 
Republican Party in the 
2016 election. I’m really 
excited 
that 
Detroit’s 
getting a lot of recognition. 
I’m 
from 
a 
suburb 
of 
Detroit, so anything that 
boosts economy and gives 
Detroiters 
an 
influence 
and power in the national 
stage is really a good thing. 
I’m really interested to see 
what the Democrats have 
to say because I don’t want 
to just blindly support the 
incumbent and I want to 
make sure I hear all views.”
The first debate will be 
held in Miami, Florida.

Lightfoot 
received 
her 
bachelor’s degree in political 
science from the University, 
graduating 
with 
honors 
in 1984. According to her 
campaign website, Lightfoot 
“paid her own way through 
college with loans and a series 
of work-study jobs” and went 
on to get her law degree from 
the University of Chicago.
Law 
professor 
Barbara 
McQuade tweeted her support, 
noting Lightfoot’s time as a 
resident adviser at Bursley 
Hall in the 1980s.
“Hey, Chicago! Here’s your 
chance to elect a tremendous 
leader, 
@LightfootForChi,” 
McQuade tweeted. “I have 
known and respected Lori 
Lightfoot since she was an RA 
in Bursley Hall at @Umich. 
She solved problems with great 
integrity then, and has spent 3 
decades learning and serving. 
Vote for Lori.”
University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald 
congratulated 
Lightfoot on her victory.
“It’s always gratifying to 
see our graduates succeed at 
the highest levels, especially 
for those who choose public 
service,” Fitzgerald said.
LSA senior Maddie Sinder, 
a resident of Chicago, said 
Lightfoot’s win has the ability 
to inspire change in the city.
“This is an exciting time in 
Chicago politics,” Singler said. 
“In such a competitive mayoral 
race, it is remarkable that a 
candidate willing to stick to 
her convictions could rise to 
victory. I believe that Lightfoot 
has the political ability and 
determination 
to 
make 
a 
positive difference in Chicago… 
Her focus on inclusion and 
helping the underserved will 
promote substantive progress 
for our city.”
The election saw low voter 
turnout, with only 35 percent 
of registered voters showing 
up to the polls. According 
to the Chicago Sun-Times, 
Lightfoot won over a majority 
of 
demographics, 
including 

white, Black and Hispanic 
voters, a group reminiscent 
of the “rainbow coalition” 
that helped elect the city’s 
first 
Black 
mayor, 
Harold 
Washington, in 1983.
Business sophomore Hollya 
Israil, a resident of Chicago, 
said she was excited to see 
Lightfoot win.
“I 
think 
electing 
Lori 
Lightfoot is significant for 
Chicago, especially for a city 
that is stereotypically known 
to be segregated, and feel as 
if her strong background as 
a diverse lawyer resonates 
with residents concerned with 
City Hall corruption and low-
income/working class minority 
groups being left behind in 
political 
decision-making 
because she is a supporter 
of 
neighborhood 
school 
improvements, 
expanding 
housing 
affordability, 
job 
expansions 
and 
other 
social issues that divide the 
population,” Israil said.
Lightfoot will succeed two-
term mayor Rahm Emanuel, 
a former chief of staff to 

President 
Barack 
Obama. 
Emanuel decided not to seek 
re-election as his approval 
ratings 
dropped 
in 
recent 
years, due in large part to 
anger over the city’s response 
to the 2014 police shooting of 
17-year-old Laquan McDonald.
During Emanuel’s tenure, 
Lightfoot led a task force that 
pushed for broad changes to 
the Chicago Police Department 
to 
combat 
discrimination. 
On the campaign trail, she 
pledged to reform policing in 
the city and root out abuses of 
power by law enforcement. She 
also touted her understanding 
of the inner workings of city 
government.
“I think I’ve had a lot of 
experience in helping run most 
challenging 
city 
agencies,” 
Lightfoot said. “I have a very 
deep knowledge of how the 
city works, both from that 
experience, and also I helped 
a lot of different individuals 
in business navigate a lot of 
byzantine processes in the 
city.”

Jennifer Hall, the executive 
director for the Ann Arbor Housing 
Commission, said in an email 
interview that affordable housing 
projects are actually beneficial for 
both residents and the city. Hall 
noted programs like the voucher 
waitlist reduce the number of 
people who have to find alternate 
living situations.
“When people cannot pay their 
rent, they end up losing their 
housing and end up moving in 
with family and friends or living 
in their vehicles or living on the 
street,” Hall said. “It is much less 
expensive to build housing than it 
is to provide emergency services 
to homeless households in shelters, 
schools, hospitals and jails.”
Housing choice vouchers are 
subsidies given by the federal 
government to assist low-income 
families with demonstrated need. 
Public housing agencies, which are 
specific to each county, manage 
the vouchers. According to a fact 
sheet from the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, 
the individual public housing 
agencies determine a family’s 
eligibility for a housing voucher 
and ask that each family allocate 30 
percent of their income to rent and 
utilities.
According to Hall, more than 
90 percent of Washtenaw County 
households that make less than 
$20,000 spend more than half 
of their income on rent. Hall 
said the high cost of living in 
Ann Arbor is due in part to the 
University, which is the largest 
employer in the community and 
often forces low-income residents 
to seek housing elsewhere.
“The 
University 
does 
not 
pay property taxes to support 
the city’s infrastructure and 
continues to purchase private 
properties, which removes them 
from the tax rolls,” Hall said. “The 
University continues to increase 
student 
enrollment 
and 
hire 
more faculty and staff without 
providing 
additional 
housing 
opportunities in the community. 
It’s simple supply and demand 
and the demand is far outpacing 
supply, which drives up housing 
costs for everyone.”
Lauren 
Schandevel, 
Public 
Policy senior and chair of Central 
Student 
Government’s 
Food 
Insecurity and Affordability Task 
Force, echoed Hall’s statement 
and said the affordable housing 
crisis can even affect areas 
outside of Ann Arbor.
“There aren’t enough dorms 
for the students we are admitting, 
and that’s a huge problem,” 
Schandevel said. “But also Ann 
Arbor is becoming increasingly 
expensive, so students have to 
move far away from campus or to 
Ypsilanti, which is subsequently 
gentrifying Ypsilanti, which is a 
city-university dynamic going on 
that makes it really unaffordable 
to live near campus.”
A few weeks ago, Schandevel 
and the other members of the task 
force contacted a pastor at a local 
church to turn that church into 
an affordable housing complex 
for students in need of more 
low-cost 
housing. 
Schandevel 
also noted how most of the 
solutions to affordable housing 
are organized and implemented 
by students rather than the 

University administration itself.
“None of this stuff is initiated 
by the University, which is a huge 
problem,” Schandevel said. “If 
it’s students doing all the work, 
there’s only so much we can do.”
In the past year, a variety of 
student housing developments 
have been proposed in Ann 
Arbor with mixed success. These 
proposals include a plan for 19 
units designated as affordable 
housing for low-income students.
Hall said the city has taken 
steps to fix the issue of affordable 
housing but has not yet been 
able to address the needs of all 
residents. She said the city’s 
current measures, which include 
donating over $1 million per 
year to local nonprofits, do not 
confront the root causes of 
housing unaffordability.
“The root cause is that the 
housing stock in the community 
does not match the income of the 
community,” Hall said. “We either 
need to increase the amount of 
housing stock that is affordable 
to low-income households and/
or people need to make a living 
wage so that they can afford the 
housing that is available.”
Susan Beckett, publisher at 
Groundcover News, a news outlet 
focusing on the needs of low-
income Ann Arbor residents, 
said the plans currently in place 
for 
affordable 
housing 
were 
made 15 years ago and are no 
longer sufficient. She also noted 
how people from across the 
country apply for housing choice 
vouchers in Washtenaw County 
because there are no restrictions 
on where applicants’ geographic 
location is.
“It was done with these low-
income housing tax credits, 
which 
only 
required 
those 
places to stay affordable for 
15 to 30 years,” Beckett said. 
“So that’s one thing. And there 
aren’t enough housing choice 
vouchers available and then the 
way those things work is that 
anyone can apply for a housing 
choice voucher anywhere in 
the country, they have to live in 
whatever place they first came 
from for a year, but after that 
they can transfer it anywhere. 
So people who live in places 
where housing choice vouchers 
have never come up because 
they’re in such high demand, 
they apply for them no matter 
where they come from.”
Beckett, who said the high 
number of applicants indicate 
that 
the 
system 
is 
“highly 
distressed,” also highlighted how 
the U.S. government as a whole is 
often unwilling to spend money 
on housing subsidies. She said 
this lack of funding contributes to 
affordable housing crises across 
the country.
“We’ve got a Congress that has 
been unwilling to spend money on 
anything except tax cuts for quite 
a long time,” Beckett said. “I don’t 
think it’s that they don’t want to 
spend it on affordable housing 
— if it’s not a tax cut, they don’t 
want to spend it at all. But the 
other side of it is that a lot of them 
associate 
subsidized 
housing 
with housing projects and that 
being a failure, and nobody wants 
to be part of a failure. So I think 
part of it is a matter of education, 
letting them build places that 
have done integrated housing — it 
works.”

The School of Education 
has been my window of 
opportunity to pursue my 
passions of making a difference 
in the education system.”
Following Elshafei’s election, 
Law student Victoria Allen 
gave a final report on the CSG 
election. In her presentation, 
Allen 
addressed 
concerns 
regarding 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Dylan 
Haugh-
Ewald’s presidential candidacy, 
of which he previously told The 
Daily he was uninformed.
According to Allen, Haugh-
Ewald turned in an election 
packet with multiple items 
filled out incorrectly, which 
were not initially caught by the 
Election Commission. She said 
she did not hear of any changes 
that needed to be made to the 
candidate list when she sent it 
out March 13.
Allen 
said 
Haugh-Ewald 
reached out to her March 21 
regarding his name on the 
ballot. She changed his election 
status, but failed to respond 
to him to inform him of the 
change. Haugh-Ewald filled 
out a filler platform on the 

sample ballot, and Allen said 
he asked her if he could change 
it once he saw his name on the 
presidential ticket.
“(Haugh-Ewald) 
reached 
out to me about (the filler 
platform) on March 27, which 
was when the election ballot 
was live, and it would’ve been 
inappropriate to change it,” 
Allen said. “I note that in my 
report that it was an error on 
my end and I did not follow up 
with him, but at the same time 
he had four days to change 
his platform and review the 
sample ballot, so that’s human 
error on both sides.”
The 
Assembly 
then 
nominated Whit Froehlich, 
third-year medical student, for 
speaker of the Ninth Assembly. 
Assembly 
members 
also 
nominated LSA sophomore 
Ben Glass to serve as vice 
speaker.
For the next portion of 
the meeting, the Assembly 
nominated members to serve 
as chairs and vice chairs of each 
of the six CSG committees. 
The 
Assembly 
nominated 
Rackham student Austin Glass 
for chair and Engineering 
freshman Carla Voigt for vice 
chair of the Rules Committee. 

LSA freshman Joey Schrayer 
was elected as chair and 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Sandra Dubaisi as vice chair 
of 
the 
Communications 
Committee.
In addition, the Assembly 
voted 
Engineering 
junior 
Mario Galindez as chair and 
LSA freshman Marwan Bazzi 
as vice chair of the Finance 
Committee. 
LSA 
freshman 
Sujin Kim became chair and 
LSA sophomore Selena Bazzi 
became vice chair of the 
Resolutions Committee, and 
Rackham 
student 
Hayden 
Jackson was elected chair 
and LSA sophomore Audrey 
Lynch was elected vice chair 
of the Executive Nominations 
Committee. 
Lastly, 
Law 
student 
Martese 
Johnson 
became chair and Engineering 
junior 
Zeke 
Majeske 
became vice chair of the 
Ethics Committee, and LSA 
sophomore Mia Kalt became 
the 
Bystander 
Intervention 
Training liaison.
At the conclusion of the 
meeting, 
Gerstein 
and 
Blanchard gave their first 
executive 
communications 
of 
the 
semester. 
Gerstein 
discussed the privilege of his 

position as CSG president and 
said he and Blanchard hope to 
serve as a valuable resource to 
the Assembly and University 
students.
“During the election, we 
all ran with the individual 
promises and action to make 
a change on campus, being a 
voice for the student body and 
an advocate to the University 
administration,” Gerstein said. 
“This responsibility shouldn’t 
be taken lightly, and our 
collective mission to encourage 
students in civic engagement, 
to voice student concerns and 
actively welfare the Michigan 
experience for everyone is a 
task we will all hold ourselves 
accountable for.”
In her statement, Blanchard 
encouraged 
Assembly 
members to find topics they 
believe 
are 
important 
to 
address 
through 
CSG 
on 
campus during their last weeks 
of the semester on campus.
“Your time spent in this 
organization ... it does not 
go unnoticed and it’s greatly 
appreciated,” Blanchard said. 
“… I hope you find what you’re 
passionate about as well as 
the resources you need to 
accomplish those goals.”

L

ike so many others, 
it 
seems 
that 
my 
adolescence 
has 
been 
characterized 
by 
an 
ongoing 
and 
increasingly 
fraught battle with 
my own skin. It was 
an all-out offense 
against an enemy 
that I wasn’t even 
really sure I knew. 
I had patches of dry 
skin on my cheeks 
as well as a perpetually oily 
forehead, and it felt like I was 
in a never-ending state of 
redness. It seemed that when 
I finally got rid of the zits 
on my chin, they’d reappear 
with vengeance below my 
nose, and as an athlete in 
high school, it seemed I was 
constantly sweaty and oily. 
I’d rip gunk out of my pores 
with a pore strip, only to 
re-clog them with makeup 
and moisturizer. You’re not 
supposed to pop zits, but I 
would anyway and then I’d 
dry them out with OXY, a 
chemical that came in a roll-
on and smelled like cleaning 
solution. This was obviously 
very astringent and harsh 
on my young, teenage skin, 
and then I’d justify it by 
washing my face and treating 
it with various products from 
Lush, a company I knew 
to be ethical — and more 
importantly in my teenage 
brain — handmade and all 
natural. Did this do anything 
for my skin? Probably not. 
I didn’t know what half of 
the products I used did, and 
I probably would have been 
just as well off had I simply 
washed my face every day. 
If we’re being honest, I still 
don’t totally know what half 
of my skincare regimen is 
really for. I have products 
I use and a routine I follow 
daily, but what is it actually 
doing for my skin? I don’t 
know, but it makes me feel 
good — like I’m taking care of 
myself, like I’m controlling 
something that I can control.
Skincare has emerged in 
recent years as a common 
form of self-care. Something 
utilitarian 
and 
ordinary 
became an easy way for 
people, especially women, to 
feel like they were living a 
healthy lifestyle and making 
themselves beautiful in the 
process. 
Skincare 
culture 
and makeup culture go hand 
in hand, especially in recent 
years. No matter how positive 
a spin you put on it, or how 
much feminist praxis you 
apply, these are multibillion-
dollar industries that exploit 
the insecurities of women 
for a profit. Makeup has 
been 
through 
an 
image 
rehabilitation in recent years: 
“It’s an art form,” people say, 
or “It’s meant to highlight 

your natural beauty and hide 
blemishes.” The fact remains, 
however, 
that 
women are under 
enormous amounts 
of 
pressure 
to 
wear 
and 
spend 
money on makeup, 
often at the risk of 
getting paychecks 
cut. 
Skincare 
is 
a little easier to 
frame in a positive 
light: It’s all about 
finding 
your 
natural 
beauty, 
achieving 
beauty without makeup. But 
is it really natural beauty if 
you’re altering the chemical 
makeup of your face?
In 
her 
article 
“The 
Skincare 
Con,” 
Krithika 
Varagur writes about the 
rise of skincare in popular 
culture, 
with 
her 
thesis 
being, 
“Perfect 
skin 
is 
unattainable 
because 
it 
doesn’t exist.” She writes of 
women who have gone to see 
dermatologists after using a 
cocktail of products that has 
left their skin badly burned. 
One woman described her 
face as being “one big open 
wound,” with visible cracking 
everywhere. 
Dr. 
Whitney 
Bowe, a dermatologist based 
in New York, criticized the 
sheer number of products 
on the market, describing 
how 
people 
“haphazardly 
combine 
products 
not 
realizing that many of them 
are overlapping, rather than 
complementing, one another 
when it comes to mechanism 
of action.”

This results in inflamed 
and irritated skin, a situation 
she describes as “far from 
atypical.” 
The 
fact 
also 
remains that engaging with 
the skincare industry can also 
be prohibitively expensive. It 
costs money to afford all the 
goops and creams that are 
supposed to give you dewy, 
glowing skin (although the 
trend of dewy skin seems to 
be on the way out, a deeply 
unfortunate occurrence for 
me, a naturally shiny (read: 
sweaty) person). According 
to 
one 
survey, 
American 
women apply an average of 
16 skincare products per day, 
and the serums the website 
advertised to me were $28 at 
the cheapest and $281 at the 
most expensive. Not from 
Costco-sized 
tubs, 
either, 

but little containers ranging 
from 1 to 7 ounces. Despite 
all of this nonsense, spending 
this money on skincare seems 
almost necessary. In one of 
her most interesting points, 
Varagur 
posits 
that 
the 
skincare industry frames it 
as an almost moral question: 
If you don’t have good skin, 
you’re not taking care of 
yourself.
Your skin is good. It is 
your 
largest 
organ 
(yes, 
the skin is an organ, don’t 
think about it too much) 
and it is protecting you 
and keeping you safe all 
the time. It protects you 
against diseases and foreign 
bodies, regulates your body 
temperature, prevents water 
loss, 
insulates 
your 
soft 
tissue, 
produces 
vitamins 
and is the reason you feel 
physical sensations. It is a 
complex and finely tuned 
machine, and it has evolved 
to function to protect you. 
A zit isn’t a bad thing; it’s 
your 
body’s 
reaction 
to 
protect you from a foreign 
antibody. 
The 
world 
is 
constantly 
assaulting 
our 
skin, 
with 
mineral-heavy 
and 
toxic 
water, 
ever-
changing weather and the 
bone-crushing, soul-sucking 
stress 
that 
comes 
from 
simply existing in today’s 
society. All the flaws and 
blemishes that multibillion 
dollar companies are trying 
to get you to fix with their 
creams 
and 
serums 
are 
natural reactions from your 
body to keep you healthy.
So what now? Will I stop 
buying 
skincare 
products 
and stop using them all 
together? 
Probably 
not. 
Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
know, logically, that zits are 
normal well into adulthood, 
I 
will 
almost 
certainly 
continue to rub my Lush 
products 
on 
problematic 
spots until they go away. I 
do think that my deep dive 
into the skincare industry 
has made me more critical, 
however, of the products 
I’m buying. I’m wary of 
very 
astringent 
products 
that wear away at skin, and 
I’m hesitant to purchase 
something that will disrupt 
my skin’s natural patterns 
too much, even if it means 
I’ll look like a big bottle of 
olive oil during the summer 
months. 
There’s 
no 
easy 
answer, as participation in 
these 
multibillion 
dollar 
industries seems inevitable, 
and indeed, mandatory at 
times. The only thing I can 
really do with any amount of 
certainty is to trust my body 
and trust the skin I’m in. It’s 
good skin, and I’m lucky to 
live in it.

f you were to look at 
the header portion of 
any 
of 
my 
school 
notebooks, 
regardless of subject 
or year in school, 
you would find an 
amalgamation 
of 
monochromatic 
doodles done with 
my favorite pen.
Art has always 
been an outlet for 
me in a variety of 
forms. Whether it 
be sketching, singing along 
far too loudly in the car or 
creative 
writing, 
art 
has 
served 
as 
something 
that 
can make change and impact 
individuals 
on 
numerous 
levels.
Coming to college, entirely 
unaware of how I would best 
embrace 
this 
passion 
and 
outlet as someone planning 
to 
study 
government, 
I 
mentioned this anxiety to 
my academic counselor who 
pointed me toward what I 
believe is one of the most 
impactful 
organizations 
this campus supports. The 
Prison Creative Arts Project, 
housed in the University’s 
LSA 
Residential 
College, 
makes the restorative aspect 
of art accessible to those in 
prison facilities throughout 
the state of Michigan. It is 
via 
this 
organization 
and 
the complimentary academic 
course that this notion of art 
as restorative, as an outlet 
and as something to create 
small and large scale change, 
is fostered.
The 
power 
of 
art 
is 
something that has become 
apparent to those involved 
with 
the 
organization, 
also known as PCAP. LSA 
sophomore Zoey Horowitz, 
creative writing facilitator, 
explained 
that 
the 
organization has given her 
a greater understanding of 
how engaging in artistic and 
creative 
processes 
can 
be 
personally 
rewarding. 
She 
stated that, through PCAP, 
she has been able to hone 
her 
own 
appreciations 
of 
creative expression while also 
introducing and facilitating 

that mechanism to others.
Through 
my 
own 
participation 
in 
this program in the 
past, I have seen 
the 
unique 
and 
singular ability of 
art 
as 
something 
that 
can 
bring 
people of differing 
experiences 
and 
from 
entirely 
separate 
spaces 
together. 
This 
is 
due to the shared 
experience that many forms of 
art can provide. Working with 
art in this capacity has only 
reinforced my appreciation 
and understanding of all art 
forms — both within popular 
culture and in an individual 
capacity. 
It 
was 
working 
with 
this 
organization 
that 
gave 
me 
a 
personal 
understanding that art can be 
something lighthearted while 
simultaneously tapping into 
something 
more 
profound. 
The sheer joy that the shared 
experience of singing a song 
or discussing the first time 
one 
heard 
something 
on 
the radio brought a sense of 
lightness and understanding 
that truly took me aback.

There 
is 
something 
unique 
about 
art. 
While 
brainstorming, I truly do not 
believe there is something 
else akin to the depth of 
individual 
and 
collective 
experience that art can create. 
We can sometimes take this 
experience 
for 
granted, 
like when we casually come 
together and converse about a 
shared memory about a movie 
or that one Taylor Swift song 
that was popular in middle 
school. Art is something that 

can bind us together in a way 
that 
most 
other 
mediums 
cannot.
In an age where funding 
for art programs is routinely 
cut, and creative expression 
sometimes takes a backseat 
to other programs, let us 
challenge this notion of art 
as something to be rid of or 
stripped from a budget. Let 
us champion as a community, 
as students and as people the 
importance of what art can 
be and do for each and every 
one of us. It is organizations 
like 
PCAP 
that 
recognize 
and validate the importance 
of the transformative effects 
both individual and collective 
experiences 
engaging 
with 
art can provide.
Seeing 
the 
beauty 
of 
creative 
expression 
in 
a 
variety of forms and watching 
how 
memories 
of 
songs 
can bring people together 
and 
experience 
emotions 
connected to written word 
or 
movies 
exhibits 
the 
power 
art 
has 
to 
shape 
individual 
dynamics 
and 
transform 
individual 
and 
group experiences. Art has 
the unique ability to offer 
an outlet for so many — as it 
has for me. Let us celebrate 
those bringing creative or 
expressive opportunities to 
others, as it can be just one 
of many methods for growth, 
understanding and change. 
Having the ability to express 
oneself in a society clouded 
with divisive rhetoric and 
channeling 
those 
energies 
in a positive or individually 
beneficial 
way 
is 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance. 
Art 
does not have to be what one 
would 
traditionally 
define 
it as. It can be something as 
simple 
as 
humming 
along 
to something or doodling at 
the top of a page. Whatever 
one’s definition may be, let us 
make art accessible, because 
it, in its variety of forms and 
means, has the power to bring 
change.

Living in “The Lorax”
W

hen I was 5 years 
old, every night, I 
would lie in my bed 
under a mountain of covers, 
snuggled up next to my mom 
so she could read me a bedtime 
story. Usually I would fall 
asleep instantly — the warmth 
that resonated from her, the 
comfort I experienced, and the 
soothing voice she read with 
would catalyze what seemed 
like an explosion of melatonin, 
and my eyes would flutter then 
close. I would fall into my pillow 
and promptly drift into the 
nighttime, typically before she 
even got past the first couple 
pages. However, one night in 
particular was different as I was 
tired and curled up under the 
covers.
My mom picked up a new 
book and read the title aloud, 
“The Lorax,” and immediately 
I was intrigued. It was the 
first time in weeks she read 
something other than the usual 
“Biscuit” or “Magic Treehouse” 
book. Instead of dozing off, I 
attentively absorbed all of the 
information she read. However, 
it 
was 
not 
Ted 
Wiggins’ 
hankering ambition to plant a 
tree for his fancied Audrey that 
sticks with me today, but it was 
the sweet and simple moral of 
the story: respect nature. It 
was this sentiment that has 
stayed with me 14 years later 
as a student in the Program in 
the Environment yearning to 
salvage what we have left of 
the natural world as personal 
interest degrades what Mother 
Earth gifted us.
In “The Lorax,” The Once-ler 
let his own intrinsic motivation 
to profit from the Thneed, his 
product, kill the animals, spoil 
the flamboyantly colored trees 
and ruin pristine nature. The 
Once-ler’s actions resulted in 
the establishment of a city called 
Thneedville, a city full of fake 
vegetation run by a businessman 
who 
commercialized 
fresh 
oxygen. Beyond the walls of 

the cities, hidden from public 
view, lay the harsh realities of 
the Once-ler’s selfishness: a 
desolate and barren terrain.
“The Lorax” and I quickly 
transcended to a nostalgic state. 
It took me back to being five 
years old, when all I wanted to 
do was chase butterflies and 
smell the roses, a time before I 
could even enunciate climate 
change let alone tell you what 
it is. The event that reminded 
me of “The Lorax” is the super 
bloom unfolding in California. 
Formerly 
green 
and 
barren 
mountains, after a heavy winter 
rainfall, have transformed into 

brightly colored fields painting 
the terrain vivid shades of 
purple, orange and yellow. As 
I scrolled through pictures, I 
was quickly reminded of the 
scene in “The Lorax” when 
the Once-ler first arrives in 
the Truffula Forest — before 
he catalyzes mass destruction. 
However, beyond the striking 
similarities in scenery, there 
was also an eerie familiarity in 
the destruction of nature from 
“The Lorax.” Jean Rhyne, a 
California State Parks employee, 
made the comparison to humans 
and invasive species. This is 
because the influx of tourists 
following the flowers for the 
idealistic picture are stepping 
on and in between the flowers, 
which crushes the roots and 
kills them. The human desire is 
killing the flowers of the super 
bloom.
Yet this is not the only means 

by which humans are destroying 
nature. 
Since 
1993, 
humans 
have 
tarnished 
3.3 
million 
square kilometers of the world’s 
wilderness, equivalent to an area 
twice the size of Alaska. Each 
year, we have lost over 7.3 million 
hectares, or 7.3 million Michigan 
Stadiums, worth of forest due to 
deforestation, an additional 1.5 
acres of rainforest being removed 
every second. Anecdotally, Lake 
Poopo in Bolivia is completely 
dry due to human-caused global 
warming, as a body of water 
comparable to an expanse the 
size of Rhode Island is now just 
a salt-crusted lake bed. As of 
2014, we have lost 52 percent of 
biodiversity, as we have lost 76 
percent of freshwater wildlife 
and 39 percent of marine and 
terrestrial wildlife since 1970. If 
these trends continue at the rapid 
rate they are moving, we could 
be without wilderness by the 
end of the century and a world 
with no trees, dry waterways 
and limited biodiversity that will 
look much like the area outside of 
Thneedville.
This all prompts the question: 
Are we living in “The Lorax?” Is 
the Once-ler a metaphor for the 
omnipresent human destruction 
of nature? Currently, there are 
many 
entrepreneurs 
actually 
capitalizing on the pervasive 
issue of pollution and poor air 
quality by actually selling air. 
Vitality Air traps air and sells it 
in bottles of 160 “breaths” of pure 
oxygen for $32. The company is 
constantly growing and is not 
the only business in the market. 
Sounds 
similar 
to 
Aloysius 
O’Hare and his company O’Hare 
Air. So what can we do to keep 
“The Lorax” a fable and not allow 
the story to materialize? Well 
I think the Once-ler answers it 
best, “Unless someone like you 
cares a whole awful lot, nothing 
is going to get better. It’s not.”

Wednesday, April 3, 2019 — 5A

About 20 minutes past the intended start time, we still stood 
outside the Michigan Theater’s screening room in claustrophobic 
gridlock. I realized I had no idea what I had gotten myself into.
Welcome to the Ann Arbor Film Festival’s ‘Films in Competition 
9: Animation.’
My editors and fellow film writers warned me, an AAFF first-
timer, these films would be weird. Fourteen animated shorts and 
countless emotions, all derivatives of discomfort, later, I don’t 
know if “weird” is the right word.
They kicked off the competition with a 1975 animated short, 
“Quasi at the Quackadero.” Anthropomorphic ducks go to an 
amusement park, the one named Anita repeatedly croons the 
name “Quasi” in a bone-chilling way, and I can’t tell you much 
more than that because I think I’ve blocked it out.
I learned two things. First, this festival attracts a crowd. I’m 
talking an eventual 30-minute delay to the start-time, due to the 
monumental task of getting everyone into the theater. I’m talking 
energy: The AAFF title sequence began, and someone clapped 
along to the moderately catchy backing tune. Someone shouted, 
“Oh, Quasi!” Oh, Quasi. I did not laugh once. My reaction was 
fight or flight. As I registered laughter around me, I came to a 
second understanding: This festival attracts a subcommunity, one 
I am not a part of, and don’t plan on joining. It felt like one of those 
scenarios where you’re sitting among a group of friends, closer to 
each other than you are to them. They’re laughing at something 
and you only vaguely understand it, let alone find it funny, so you 

experience this discomfort — equal parts pain and longing — not 
so much for inclusion but for the vexation to cease.
As my level of discomfort became unbearable, I began to coach 
myself through it. Yes, a few of the shorts were so thoroughly, 
unproductively disturbing, that I had to go to my happy place. I 
think “Hedge” did the most damage: Child leashes, squadrons 
of women kissing each other nonstop, and again, I can’t tell you 
much more than that because I’ve blocked it out.

I wasn’t the only one who reacted this way. During one of 
several films that should have come with a warning for those 
with photosensitivity (but didn’t), consisting of a stream of 
flashing shapes, I glanced over, and my fellow moviegoer’s face 
encapsulated everything I now try to render in words. Her mouth 
was slightly open: Shock. It was shaped in a partial smirk: Slight 
bemusement, or the facial version of Where am I? Her eyes were 
wide: What am I looking at?
When I realized I had over an hour of this ahead of me still, 
I attempted a change in mindset. To try and find it funny, too. 

Resign to the absurdity. Stop expecting art to have a purpose and 
seek pleasure alone.
It didn’t work. I still saw text used profusely and always for 
the purpose of propagandistic, stale messages. I saw half-
assed, hypocritical criticisms of human dependence on religion, 
technology and other familiar targets. Underneath it all, I saw 
a troubling idleness that shrugged and said, yes, this is enough. 
Flash some shocking graphics, prop up the images with recycled 
critiques, pepper it with opaque, self-indulgent tidbits and you’ve 
got yourself a work of art. What about the audience? What do we 
have to gain from that?
There was one, fleeting moment of reprieve in the competition: 
“Sun Zoom Spark.” Containing some of the most stunning 
graphics of the night, the film alternated between images of 
industrialized and untainted geography, appearing like blotted 
graphite compositions. A poetic, mesmerizing voiceover stitched 
the scenes together, providing compelling commentary on 
our changing notion of mistakes in a world with the CTRL + z 
function. At times, the speech felt stilted, but I’ll take preachy 
over pointless any day. At least the former is direct and aware 
of the communicative potential of art, rather than smugly self-
content.
Granted, I did experience some version of the subcommunity I 
spoke about. Leaving the theater with my friends, we debriefed on 
our almost synonymous experience of the shorts as a bad omen of 
a direction artists are moving in. We had the same questions for 
each other: What was that? What was that for?
And I’m still not convinced that weird is the right word. I’d say 
puzzling at best, dispiriting at worst.

For ‘Animation,’ weird doesn’t feel like the right word

ANN ARBOR FILM FESTIVAL COVERAGE

JULIANNA MORANO

I’m going to put the following 
very 
plainly: 
The 
music 
of 
Liverpool group Her’s is fuzzy 
dream pop, pleasant and dynamic. 
They released their latest studio 
album, Invitation to Her’s, last 
summer. On Mar. 27, 2019, while 
touring to support the album, 
both members of the group were 
killed in a traffic accident. The 
band was driving through the 
desert of Arizona around 1 a.m. 
on the way from Phoenix to Santa 
Ana when a truck driving the 
wrong way down the highway 
hit them head-on. All parties 
perished in the crash. The bodies 
were unidentifiable. Everything 
in the car was lost to fire.
It’s a cliche at this point for an 
artist to die a tragic death, only to 
finally gain the appreciation they 
sought after they have passed. 
This is not the case for Her’s. It 
is unlikely that they will gain 
posthumous fame in the manner 
of Van Gogh. More likely, they 
will slowly fade into obscurity. 
Many who stumble upon their 
music won’t even know they have 

passed. To their fans, it is an 
unspeakable tragedy. To most of 
the world, it is meaningless.
Her’s second-to-last Instagram 
post features them posing in the 
diner from Twin Peaks. In the 
comments, they promise a fan 
that they will return to Phoenix 
for another show. Their social 
media pages have now become 
a jarring, unplanned memorial 
to the dead that once occupied 
them, unfulfilled dreams and 
shattered plans, once-innocent 
posts now a depressing reminder 
that the good times can’t last.
It’s not just Her’s. Facebook 
and 
Instagram 
are 
digital 
graveyards; millions of users 
have perished since they created 
their 
accounts. 
They 
aren’t 
quite memorials — memorials 
are 
planned, 
crafted. 
More 
accurately, they are snapshots, 
their profiles eternally frozen in 
time the moment before tragedy 
struck.
The implication of this for the 
legacy of the artist is drastic. So 
much of the legend of a musician 
comes 
from 
the 
mystery 
surrounding their lives, but the 
wall 
between 
the 
cultivated 

output of an artist and their 
personal lives has been eroded, 
for better or for worse. It’s no 
wonder we’ve seen artists like Jai 
Paul (and, initially, The Weeknd) 
who react to this new form of 
public scrutiny by embracing 
anonymity.
The Exploding Hearts, a turn-
of-the-century power pop band, 
suffered a similar fate as Her’s. 
They crashed outside Eugene, 
Oregon while on tour when the 
driver fell asleep at the wheel — 
only the guitarist was spared. 
This was before the Internet 
became omnipresent, so they 
live on solely (in a broad sense) 
through the one album they 
released.
For a lot of people, myself 
included, music is a way to escape 
into another world, akin to sports 
or reality television. The stakes 
seem lower, fake somehow, but 
sometimes 
it 
becomes 
clear 
that 
the 
walls 
keeping 
our 
distractions separate from the 
pain and mundanity of our day-
to-day lives are thin. At any 
moment, a few seconds of chaos 
could bring them crashing down. 
All it takes is a mistake in traffic.

Her’s: Death in a digital age

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

JONAH MENDELSON
Daily Arts Writer

When 
“Get 
Out” 
hit 
theaters two years ago, people 
were pretty confused: Why is 
the guy from “Key and Peele” 
making a scary movie? What 
does a comedian know about 
horror? After I saw “Us” 
last weekend, I started to 
contemplate how a comedic 
mind could leap over to the 
dark side. The film — as 
unsettling and horrifying as 
it was — provoked moments of 
chuckles from the audience. 
I couldn’t help but wonder 
(cue 
Carrie 
Bradshaw’s 
contemplative 
pose) 
what 
is the connection between 
horror and humor?
I 
immediately 
thought 
of Mel Brooks. In my mind, 
horror and humor had one 
place and one place only, 
in 
Mel 
Brooks’s 
“Young 
Frankenstein.” The monster 
made the film “scary,” but 
overall the film is a comedy. 
Brooks and the late Gene 
Wilder 
sprinkled 
horror 
tropes throughout the film 
by 
mocking 
them, 
from 
dance 
numbers 
to 
Frau 
Blucher (neigh!). Yet, Brooks 
and Wilder’s parody of old 
monster horror is just that, 
a parody. The same goes for 
“Scary Movie,” “Shaun of 
the Dead” etc. So where does 
horror and humor lie for 
Jordan Peele? Has comedy 
influenced his horror? What 
about vice versa? Are they 
connected at all? Did he have 
a midlife crisis and realize 
comedy was dead? How did 
this sketch comedian turn 
into a master of fear? And 
most 
importantly, 
is 
the 
continental breakfast sketch 
a spiritual prequel to “Get 
Out”?
For answers, I turned to the 
true master of horror himself, 
Stephen King. King does a 
good job at explaining the 
overlap of humor and horror 
in a 1993 CBS interview. “It’s 
a childish thing the way that 
humor is the two (humor and 
horror) closely allied,” he 
explained, “They both elicit 
— when they work to their 
best — a vocal reaction in the 
audience.” According to King, 
there is a connection between 
horror and humor because 
they both create some sort of 
eruption within us, one of fear 
or amusement, respectively.
Personally, I can’t stand 
being 
scared. 
In 
fact, 
I 
actively do things to avoid 
being scared. I will not enter 
my bathroom if the shower 
curtain is closed because 
there is a 1000 percent chance 
someone is in there, trying 
to 
kill 
me. 
Additionally, 
I 
distrust 
any 
mirrored 
medicine cabinet, because I 
know for a fact when I open the 
cabinet no one is behind me, 
but when I close that cabinet 

there will be a murderer and I 
will not be prepared. I detest 
surprises so much that when I 
was thrown a surprise party I 
cried because I thought I was 
getting kidnapped and I never 
fully recovered. Obviously, if 
you like being scared you’re 

probably not OK, but I get it 
if you follow Stephen King’s 
logic. The same way I like to 
be amused by comedy and 
elicit a vocal reaction, also 
known as laughter, you may 
like to get the shit scared 
out of you to elicit a vocal 
reaction AKA bloodcurdling 
screams — if you’re into that 
kind of thing.
In 
an 
interview 
with 
Cinemablend back in 2017, 
Eric Eisenberg asked Jordan 
Peele about the relationship 
between comedy and horror. 
“They’re two sides of the 
same coin,” Peele said, “Any 
really successful or great 
horror movie, you go and see 
an audience there’s going to 
be laughter from nervousness. 
They’re both about building 
the tension and releasing in 
some way.” For Peele’s horror, 
it’s all about building tension. 
Look at “Us” and “Get Out,” 
they build in tension, making 
the 
audience 
physically 
uncomfortable and nervous. 
I swear, after I saw “Us,” I 
didn’t have any fingernails, 
meaning I bit them all off 
from the anxiety the movie 
caused me.
Similarly, look at humor 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
tension. Comedy asks the 
same questions as horror, 
just with a lighter take. The 
building tension in comedy 
is the setup, a question to 
be answered, a premise to 
explore; the answer is the 
punchline. Like in horror, the 
question begs the audience 
to 
wonder, 
what’s 
going 
to happen? The changing 
answers in both genres elicit 
different 
reactions 
in 
us 
based on how those answers 
make us feel. They keep us on 
the edge of our seats with fear 
or leaning back in stitches.
I started thinking about 
what 
makes 
things 
scary 
versus funny. If the setup is 
a question and the answer is 
the punchline is the answer, 

what is the horror equivalent? 
And what makes something 
scary instead of funny? If 
building 
tension 
creates 
questions, then the answer 
has to be the thing that elicits 
our reactions. For example, in 
“The Shining” the question 
is, what is in room 237? If the 
answer was a walrus with 
a British accent instead of 
a rotting corpse, does that 
make it funny? What if in 
the SNL digital short “D*** 
in a Box” Andy Samberg and 
Justin Timberlake revealed 
that the thing inside the 
box was a hungry poisonous 
tarantula? Is that scary? If a 
family identical to your own 
showed up in your driveway 
but the only difference was 
that they all wore bowties, is 
that still scary?
All this tension makes me 
think of the 2014 “Key and 
Peele” short titled “Aerobics 
Meltdown.” The sketch is 
an old video from the 1987 
Jazz Fit Championship. The 
video opens with a line of 
text that reads: “Everything 
you are about to see is true.” 
A line of spandex-clad women 
with big hair stretch as two 
male 
dancers, 
Flash 
and 
Lighting, played by Peele 
and Key respectively, enter 
in 
similarly 
shiny 
purple 
costumes. All is well in this 
aerobics video until the video 
cuts into behind the scenes 
footage that displays itself 
more clearly. The news is 
given to Lighting through 
various cue cards that his 
wife and daughter have been 
hospitalized from a hit and 
run. Between pieces of bad 
news, cards are interlaced 
to remind Lighting to “Keep 
dancing.” Lighting’s face falls 
as he continues to dance. The 
tension builds as the director 
asks if Lighting would know 
anyone 
that 
might 
want 
to hurt him or his family. 
The recognition comes to 
Lighting as he looks over 
to his competitor and Flash 
gives him a sadistic wink. 
The clip ends with Lighting 
strangling 
Flash 
and 
the 
video cutting out. But the 
reason I bring this sketch 
up is it is a perfect example 
of the building tension that 
Peele loves to utilize in both 
his humor and horror. This 
sketch, albeit dark, provokes 
a shocked kind of laughter 
that can only be attributed to 
the genius tension-building of 
Jordan Peele.
I think the answer to 
the 
horror 
and 
humor 
conundrum 
lies 
in 
the 
answers themselves. If the 
answer makes us laugh, it’s 
comedy. If the answer makes 
us shit our pants, odds are it’s 
a horror film (or you need to 
get your bowels checked).

In the next week, the Book Review 
will be featuring works from Willow 
Books, an imprint of the Detroit-
based small publisher Aquarius 
Press. Aquarius was co-founded in 
1999 by author and professor Randall 
Horton and Heather Buchanan, 
its current owner, a University of 
Michigan-Dearborn 
alum and former Poet-in-
Residence at the Detroit 
Public Library. In 2007, 
Aquarius Press launched 
Willow Books, a project 
“to develop, publish and 
promote writers of color” 
that quickly became its 
flagship imprint. Willow 
Books 
publishes 
over 
40 single-title authors 
a year and uplifts writers through 
an impressive network of funds and 
resources. Writers were recently 
recognized at Willow Books’s annual 
LitFest readings, which took place in 
Portland, Oregon on Mar. 30.
“Don’t let your heritage be 
past tense.” It’s a warning and 
a plea, the title of the last poem 
in Sokunthary Svay’s “Apsara in 
New York,” a collection of poems 
in which Svay does just that: Fight 
to keep her culture a part of her 
present while exploring her roots 
and their intersection with her life 
as an immigrant living in the Bronx 
on an intimate and moving level.
Svay and her family came to the 
U.S. as refugees from the Khmer 
Rouge regime, which held power 
in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. The 

regime, guided by its communist 
philosophy, sought to turn the 
country 
into 
a 
self-sufficient 
agrarian 
society. 
People 
were 
forced into the countryside to work 
as laborers on farms, where many 
died from starvation or overwork. 
By the time the regime was 
overthrown by the Vietnamese 
in 1979, it was responsible for the 
deaths of just under two million 
people.

Central to many of the poems 
is, as Svay puts it, the Khmer 
American communities’ struggle 
with the dark legacy of the Khmer 
Rouge. Poems about the genocide 
and its aftermath are interspersed 
among those detailing Svay’s life 
in the Bronx, giving readers the 
distinct feeling that while the lives 
of the Khmers continue on, they are 
never really free of the aftermath of 
the regime.
The crossroads of Svay’s identity 
as a Khmer and American are 
reflected in the title of the work. An 
“apsara” is a female celestial figure 
in Buddhist and Hindu religions, 
something that is placed among 
food vendors, one dollar pizza and 
the 2 Line in “An Apsara in New 
York.” Svay’s poetry depicts her 

experiences in a startlingly vivid 
and emotional way. It is easy to feel 
her annoyance at being repeatedly 
mistaken as Chinese and her 
pain from the loss of her brother, 
who readers know is dead but not 
exactly how or why. Svay is a gifted 
writer who transports readers 
from the Bronx to Cambodia with 
ease.
A highlight of the collection is 
the focus on Svay’s relationship 
with her mother. As her 
mother’s only surviving 
child, the two share 
a special bond which 
Svay 
communicates 
flawlessly. In “Mother’s 
Call,” 
the 
strong 
personality 
of 
her 
mother and the dry, 
witty 
humor 
Svay 
employs 
throughout 
her 
poetry 
are 
fully showcased. The “Mother 
Monologue” poems also provide a 
more serious but touching insight 
into the relationship between 
the two women as they grapple 
with issues like money problems 
and marriage. Svay portrays the 
personalities of herself and her 
mother in such a realistic way they 
feel familiar and known just a few 
pages into the collection.
Svay, a singer herself, reveals her 
love of music through poems like 
“Diction” and “Music Doesn’t Put 
Food On the Table,” as well as her 
mother’s occasional exasperation 
with that love.

‘Apsara’ a beautiful tribute

THERE’S A
CROSSWORD
ON THIS
PAGE.

DO
IT.

What is a man to do after he kills off his friend and former fellow 
Marine, most of the leaders of a Chechen crime ring and (probably) 
the cop who was dating his acting teacher? These are just some of 
the questions that the titular protagonist faces in the early episodes 
of season two of “Barry.” They’re also some of the many questions 
Bill Hader (“Saturday Night Live”) faced in his development of the 
second season, as writer, director and star of the show.
Hader and Alec Berg (“Silicon Valley”) created “Barry” as a dark 
comedy about a Midwestern hitman who travels to Los Angeles, 
where he finds himself joining an acting class and beginning to 
question the nature of his profession. By the end of season one, 
Barry (played by Hader) knows he wants to leave his violent past 
behind him, but can’t seem to escape his entanglements with 
criminals like his handler, Fuches (Stephen Root, “On the Basis 
of Sex”), and Chechen mobster NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan, 
“Gotham”). In the second season, these conflicts are only going to 
ramp up, as well as the internal moralistic conflict that Barry now 
has to address head-on.
“In the first season, he would have these daydreams about what 
he wanted, and what he thinks his life could be,” Hader said to The 
Daily in a group interview. “And we were thinking, in season two, 
instead of daydreams about what his future could be — in order to 
have those things, you have to kind of reconcile your past.”
For Barry, this means looking back to his time spent as a Marine 
in Afghanistan: the place where he learned how to kill. Barry’s 
approach to remembering the war seems to carry traces of post-
traumatic stress disorder, but Hader says the writer’s room was 
more focused on Barry having to confront his current relationship 
to killing.
“It was more about Barry’s current position as a contract killer, 
and him realizing, ‘Oh, I actually, the first time I killed someone, 
at war, was the first time I ever felt any sense of community in my 
life,’” Hader said. “It was less about PTSD, and more about this 
question of, ‘What happens when I get angry, and am I evil?’”
Barry isn’t the only one forced to reflect on his past in season 
two. In fact, it seems poised to become one of the season’s central 
trends.
The violence of Barry’s past and the tension of his present 
collide in his acting class, taught by Gene Cousineau (Henry 
Winkler, “Arrested Development”). At the end of season two, Gene 
has to deal with the mysterious disappearance of his girlfriend, 
Detective Moss (Paula Newsome, “Chicago Med”). According to 
Hader, we can expect Gene to “look inward” in the episodes to 
come and consider whether he is really “just a narcissistic idiot.” 
Meanwhile, the nature of Moss’s disappearance — other than that 
Barry had a hand in it — is still unresolved.
“We had no idea what happened to her,” Hader said. “That was 
the very first day of writing season two. I said, ‘What do you guys 
think happened to Moss?’ and everyone started laughing.”
Whatever direction the show takes with Moss, we can expect 
it to be deeply significant for Gene’s development as a character 
— as well as for Barry, who we know is responsible for whatever 

happened to her.
After his military friend Chris (Chris Marquette, “All Wrong”), 
Moss marks the second major character that Barry has unwillingly 
attacked out of his own self-interest, despite knowing her and 
liking her. The fatal actions he’s taken to hold onto his new life 
leave Barry “trying to forgive himself,” but also “in massive, 
massive denial.”
“We’ve come to this place where the main character is the one 
that’s right,” Hader said. “The main character is us, that’s the 
audience surrogate. And I like movies and books and stuff where 
the main character’s really flawed, but he thinks he’s right … He’s 
lying to himself on this big thing, but hopefully it’s a thing that can 
be really relatable to people.”
The goal is that these complicated levels of reflection will 
extend to the audience, as the show offers new and deeper ways 
of understanding each character. Another compelling character is 
Sally, played by Sarah Goldberg (“The Report”), whose relationship 
with Barry hinges on, as Hader put it, the two of them “giving 
each other what the other one wants” when it comes to emotional 
support. This relationship is likely to become rockier following 
her season one finale revelation about her abusive and violent 
ex-husband.
“You meet Sally, and she seems like this sweet actress that cares 
about him, and then you see her turn. You try to play both sides of 
it, and say, ‘I totally get why she doesn’t like Barry, but I also think 
she’s a little narcissistic,’” Hader said. “So then, this season, it was 
kind of like: I’ve gotten to know you. I’ve hung out with you for a 
year. And now these are the kind of things that you would find out 
about people. People opening up about an abusive ex-husband or 
the time they were in Afghanistan, or these sorts of things. And 
then also, when you’re in an acting class, that stuff comes up a lot.”
The irony of Hader playing a bad actor in an acting class has 
been one of the show’s strengths from the beginning, creating 
plenty of opportunities for comedy and allowing Hader to stretch 
and expand his own acting talent. He received an Emmy last year 
for his portrayal of Barry, who struggles in his acting class with 
awkward and sometimes emotionless delivery. Hader himself has 
taken improv classes, but never the type of acting classes portrayed 
in the show.
“Improv acting classes is like, you just have to go up and trust 
your instincts, and kind of play off the other person, and you’re 
creating a scene up on stage,” Hader said. “Alec and I sat in on 
an acting class, on a couple of acting classes, before we wrote the 
pilot. And that’s the only real acting classes I’ve seen. A lot of it 
is actually asking the actors on the show. Like, ‘Is this what they 
would do?’”
In season one, the acting class became the perfect arena for 
central characters working through their personal issues. In a 
season likely to turn its attention toward the repercussions of the 
past, it will be intriguing to see how characters like Barry, Gene 
and Sally further evolve, reveal themselves and come into conflict 
within the walls of Gene’s acting studio.
And then there’s NoHo Hank. The audience favorite played by 
Anthony Carrigan has become the stand-in representative for the 
other side of Barry’s life, the one Barry is trying so desperately to 
escape. Yet it’s hard to watch the show and not want to see even 

more of Hank — which the show’s creators luckily realized early 
on, scrapping their decision to kill Hank off at the end of the pilot.
“Initially, that character was supposed to die in the pilot. That’s 
why he gets shot in the car,” Hader said. “And then when the show 
got picked up, Alec and I both were like, we can’t let that guy die. 
He was so funny. And then every writer we hired when we were 
staffing the show went, ‘You’re not getting rid of that guy, right? 
’Cause that guy was amazing.’”
The mobster character was originally inspired by a Genius Bar 
employee who helped Hader at an Apple store. Since the initial 
conception of a “nice” and “polite” henchman for season one 
villain Goran Pazar (Glenn Fleshler), NoHo Hank has grown into a 
compelling onscreen presence and a crucial part of the show.
“Anthony owns that character,” Hader said. “We try to find 
funny positions for him to be in, and his apparent kind of love for 
Cristobal, and this kind of love triangle that he has going on. But 
then Anthony takes it and runs with it.”
Even Hank, who often bears the role of comic relief, may be 
grappling further with the contradictions of his own identity in 
season two.
“Everyone’s kind of fighting their nature, and I think he wants 
to be a villain,” Hader said of NoHo Hank. “He wants to be a badass 
kind of tough guy. But his nature, I think, is that he’s very sweet 
and polite, and only sees the good in people, which is ironic for 
what he does for a living.”
The show so far has done a spellbinding job of weaving together 
comedy and drama using dark irony, sometimes on a broader scale 
— some of the heaviest moments come from the acting class, while 
genuine (albeit morbid) humor is gleaned from Barry’s endeavors 
as a hitman — and sometimes on the level of individual lines. 
The further Barry tries to distance himself from his violent past, 
the darker the show seems to get, all while keeping its comedic 
integrity intact.
“That’s always the hard thing about the show, is going too far one 
way or the other. But what we end up doing so we don’t overthink 
it is, you just try to follow the truth of the character. You try to be 
as honest as you can with all of the characters, and just say, well, 
what would they do right here? And sometimes that can lend itself 
to being funny, and sometimes it can be really sad,” Hader said. “It 
kind of works, because we’ll write it straight for so long, and Alec 
and I are comedy people, so then we start to get bored and we’ll 
start making fun of our own writing, and then that’s where a lot of 
the comedy will come in.”
It’s hard to describe Barry as anything other than a tightly-
produced show: The writing is sharp on both the comedic and 
the dramatic ends, each scene is packed with conflict, and the 
characters are expertly conceived and rendered. Season one 
developed at an mastered pace, aided on its way by captivating 
acting and an almost total absence of filler, and season two is set 
to continue along the same masterful trajectory, featuring even 
darker ventures into these characters’ psyches.
“A lot of shows or stories … you want to do 20 seasons of these 
things, you know? And so you try to let that happen slowly. But 
I think that’s why television, sometimes, for me, I get really 
exasperated,” Hader said. “For us, it was like, no, let’s just let that 
happen now. What are we waiting on?”

Bill Hader talks confronting the past in ‘Barry’

TV INTERVIEW: BILL HADER

LAURA DZUBAY
Daily Arts Writer

The 
opening 
track 
of 
The 
Hands 
Free’s 
self-
titled 
debut, 
“Yes/No,” 
starts with an explosion 
of 
instrumental 
sound, 
pulling in every direction 
at once. It almost sounds 
like a folk festival band 
warming up — the group’s 
instrumentation of violin, 
accordion, 
banjo/guitar 
and double bass is usually 
employed for things much 
more twangy and down-
home — until it’s repeated, 
and spins out into a frenetic 
phrase that collapses almost 
as soon as it gets going. The 
rest of the track is no less 
of an onslaught, at times 
coalescing into fragments 
of melody before dissolving 
into the joyous chaos of 
the 
opening. 
After 
the 
aggression 
of 
“Yes/No,” 
the second track, “Kellam’s 
Reel/Rusty 
Gully,” 
is 
a 
comforting relief. A jaunty 
melody is passed from the 
accordion 
to 
the 
guitar, 
the 
other 
instruments 
sometimes 
joining 
in 
on 
regular accompaniment and 
sometimes 
just 
smearing 
chords around the edges of 
the ensemble. The effect is 
breezy and nostalgic.
The 
Hands 
Free, 
whose 
members 
have 
backgrounds 
in 
classical 
music composition, chamber 
music and musical theater, 
are a group that focuses on 
structured 
improvisation. 
In the liner notes to their 
debut, they write that they 
“incorporate 
elements 
of 
improvisation, 
making 
every performance unique.” 
The 
performers 
are 
able 
to draw on their extensive 
knowledge and experience 
of 
performing 
music 
to 
re-interpret what they have 
inherited in an open-ended, 
playful way, in the moment. 
The album is in dialogue with 

several intersecting musical 
traditions, but it splits them 
open and rummages around 
for useful material, adding 
the 
performer’s 
unique 
sensibilities. In particular, 
the composer and violinist 
Caroline Shaw contributes 
the 
sense 
of 
suspension 
she’s known for, with the 
hovering 
harmonics 
and 
finely-sketched 
melodies 
she contributes forming a 
sort of ceiling for the group. 
The guitarist James Moore 
contributes at times a quasi-
minimalist flow and at times 
a 
pointillistic 
stream 
of 
consciousness, which also 
characterizes his work with 
the electric guitar quartet 
Dither.
More than anything, what 
one gets out of this album is a 
sense of several personalities 
colliding, 
a 
conversation 
between 
friends 
about 
a 
familiar topic with natural 
ebb and flow. The group 
references the “late-night 
folk jams” that formed the 
group, and one gets the sense 
that the group’s backbone 
is 
somewhere 
between 
their 
respective 
classical 
backgrounds and bluegrass 
and folk music. There’s a 
dialogue between sense and 
nonsense, 
structure 
and 
freedom, 
aggression 
and 
suspension. One gets the 
sense that were all of this to 
be written down, a lot of the 
spontaneity that makes this 
album so stunning would be 
lost — trailing off and trailing 
between is baked into even 
the most structured music 
that the group plays. There’s 
a recombinant sensibility to 
this music, like a collection 
of half-remembered songs.
Mary 
Halvorson 
and 
Robbie Lee’s album Seed 
Triangular is much more 
open-ended 
than 
The 
Hands Free’s debut. There 
are much fewer reference 
points, and the music seems 
to be instead built from the 
sounds of their instruments 
themselves: 
Halvorson’s 

18-string (!) harp guitar and 
Lee’s collection of unusual 
woodwind 
instruments, 
including 
several 
from 
the Renaissance and the 
Baroque. Halvorson and Lee 
seem intent on playing their 
instruments 
in 
strange, 
extreme ways. The guitar 
snaps and buzzes and at 
times 
makes 
thunderous 
sounds, 
Lee 
bends 
pitch 
and overblows, producing 
all kinds of noisy, out-of-
tune sounds that he uses for 
striking expressive effect. At 
times it’s hard to tell how the 
two musicians are relating 
their material to each other 
and the listener is left with a 
nervous composite.
As 
daunting 
as 
Seed 
Triangular 
is 
for 
people 
not accustomed to freely-
improvised music, it’s also 
a remarkably organic and 
instinctive album. It’s the 
chaos of an overgrown lot in 
the middle of summer, dusty 
and wide open. Their music 
can accumulate astonishing 
amounts of tension before 
emptying out into a few 
languid 
plucks 
and 
long 
bending notes. As avant-
garde as the music sounds, 
Halvorson’s guitar can be 
almost folk-ish at times, and 
Lee’s old instruments, played 
in markedly unconventional 
ways, 
combine 
to 
give 
the 
album 
a 
distinctly 
ancient feeling. It feels like 
stumbling on an abandoned 
house being reclaimed by 
nature, wiry plants forcing 
their way through the brick.
The 
avant-garde 
is 
so 
frequently about trying to 
make music take on abstract 
shapes and structures. What 
improvisation 
allows 
for 
these two albums is instead 
a kind of exploration of 
musical space: Both in the 
sense of the instruments used 
and what they’re capable of 
producing in the hands of 
a skilled player, but also an 
exploration of material, of 
tradition as interpreted in 
every direction at once.

Michigan’s leading goal scorer Will 
Lockwood returning for senior year

Michigan’s 
leading 
goal 
scorer from the 2018-19 season 
will return for his senior year, 
a team spokesperson confirmed 
on Tuesday morning.
Junior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood was in discussion 
with the Vancouver Canucks 
to forego his senior year and 
join the professional ranks, 
but he elected to return to the 
Wolverines for a final year.
The 
Canucks 
drafted 
Lockwood in the third round 
of the 2016 entry draft with the 
64th overall pick.
In his first two years at 
Michigan, Lockwood battled 
shoulder 
injuries 
that 
left 
him 
unable 
to 
reach 
his 
full 
potential. 
A 
dislocated 
shoulder his freshman season 
caused him trouble for most 

of the second half of that 
year. In his sophomore year, 
Lockwood suffered a season-
ending shoulder injury while 
competing 
for 
the 
United 
States at the World Junior 
Championships in January of 
2018.
But in his third season, 
Lockwood 
worked 
his 
way 
back to full health and was a 
valuable offensive threat for 
the Wolverines. He played in all 
36 games and tallied 31 points, 
good for second on the team 
and just two points behind 
Quinn Hughes, who signed with 
Vancouver on March 10.
Lockwood’s 16 goals — five 
more than junior forwards Nick 
Pastujov and Jake Slaker, who 
tied for second in goal scoring — 
led the team. Six of those tallies 
came on the power play, which 
made Lockwood the team’s 
leader in man-advantage goals. 

His 
goal-scoring 
acumen 
also left him ranked second on 
the team in plus-minus with a 
plus-eight rating, just behind 
freshman 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg at plus-11.
After the Wolverines’ season 
ended in the first round of the 
Big Ten Tournament, attention 
turned to Michigan’s group of 
underclassmen NHL draft picks 
and their imminent decisions. 
Hughes chose to depart after 
his sophomore season for the 
NHL, but Lockwood returning 
gives the Wolverines one of 
their top offensive threats back 
for next season.
If junior defenseman Luke 
Martin and sophomore forward 
Josh Norris also choose to 
return, Michigan could be in 
position to return to its form 
from the 2017-18 season — 
when the Wolverines made the 
Frozen Four.

Junior forward Will Lockwood led the Wolverines in 2018-19 with 16 goals, and will return for his senior season.

Deja Church to leave U-M program

In a stunning turn of events, 
sophomore guard Deja Church 
announced via Twitter that 
she will not be returning to the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team for next 
season.
“Thank you to 
The University 
Of 
Michigan!” 
Church said on 
a tweet shared 
on her official 
account. 
“I 
appreciate 
all 
your support and 
for accepting me 
with open arms! 
However I will not be returning 
to UM next season. Forever will 
love UM, but I know God has 
something else special planned 
for me! Go blue forever”
Church was the Wolverines’ 

starting shooting guard this 
season after spending much of 
her freshman campaign serving 
as the team’s backup point 
guard to Katelynn Flaherty. 
Playing off the ball allowed 
her to attack the rim more 
frequently and emphasize her 
skill as a driver.
The position 
switch 
helped 
Church average 
career bests of 
8.9 points and 
4.0 
rebounds 
per 
game, 
in 
addition 
to 
routinely 
dominating 
on 
the 
defensive 
end, 
averaging 
just over one steal per game.
Most 
recently, 
Church 
displayed 
her 
value 
to 
a 
relatively 
young 
Wolverines 
squad 
in 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament, when she posted 

12 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 
assists in a 84-54 first-round 
win over Kansas State. Even 
as the seconds dwindled down 
to zero in the final moments 
of Michigan’s season-ending 
defeat to Louisville, the future 
for next season’s campaign 
appeared bright, and Church 
was expected to be among the 
team’s key pieces.
Now, the Wolverines will 
march into 2019 without one 
of its starters and biggest 
personalities both on and off 
the court. While the loss will 
be a tough one, senior guard 
Akienreh Johnson will likely 
be more than ready to step into 
Church’s shoes as the team’s 
starting shooting guard after an 
impressive run to close out the 
season’s second half.
When asked for comment, 
a U-M spokesperson directed 
The 
Daily 
to 
Church’s 
aforementioned tweet.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Putting things in perspective

W

hat will we remember 
about the 2018-19 
Michigan men’s bas-
ketball team?
Like, really 
remember?
I only ask 
because .... 
in terms of 
memories, 
Wolverines 
fans have had 
it pretty darn 
good lately.
You’re 
going to be 
telling your 
grandchildren about 2013 and 
Trey Burke toppling mighty 
Kansas. Your heart’s probably 
still racing from that wild 2017 
run triggered by near-disaster. 
You’re never going to forget 
where you were last year when 
Jordan Poole ran laps around 
the arena in Wichita, Kan.
But when you look back on 
Michigan’s 2018-19 season, 
which ended with a 63-44 loss 
to Texas Tech in the Sweet 
Sixteen last week, there likely 
won’t be a specific game, 
moment or player that sticks 
under your eyelids above any 
other.
Maybe it’s Charles Matthews 
roaring as he hung on the rim at 
Villanova. Maybe it’s the Wol-
verines running North Carolina 
and Purdue out of the gym. 
That all happened by Decem-
ber. And sure, Michigan started 
out a program-record 17-0, but 
you can learn that in a book.
That torrid start was cer-
tainly impressive. In terms of 
banners, championships or 
indelible moments, though, it 
ultimately meant little.
It might sound like I’m 
about to imply that a lack of 
memorable moments makes a 
season disappointing. That’s 
hardly the case, and I’ll get to 
that later. But it can serve as 
something of a proxy for how 
we view the Wolverines’ most 

recent campaign, and it’s espe-
cially key in understanding the 
ending.
On Jan. 13, when Michigan 
rolled Northwestern behind a 
barrage of Zavier Simpson and 
Jon Teske 3-pointers, it looked 
almost invincible. That was 
its 17th win, and at the time, 
everything was seemingly in 
play — promised, even. John 
Beilein’s teams don’t start out 
like this team did. There were 
blemishes like always, but fix-
ing them is exactly what the 
Wolverines do under Beilein. 
Who could even imagine how 
good they would be in March — 
and maybe April?
The games, players and plays 
that are a part of recent Michi-
gan lore were accompanied 
by triumphs both expected or 
improbable. The Wolverines 
played for a national champion-
ship in 2013. They hung Big Ten 
banners in 2014, 2017 and 2018. 
The symbols of those successes 
are easily brought to memory, 
and they happened when it 
mattered most.
This season had none of that.
That historic start was the 
high point, and while it wasn’t 
all downhill from there, Michi-
gan never made it back. Its 
depth issues were never fully 
resolved. The question of who 
would score when the Wolver-
ines needed a bucket was never 
litigated to satisfaction. In the 
Sweet Sixteen, they were beat-
en by the Red Raiders and their 
top-ranked defense with almost 
eerie ease.
The season’s first three 
months set up the potential for 
a supernova. Instead, Michi-
gan, on that court in Anaheim, 
Calif., more closely resembled a 
candle being blown out swiftly 
and simply.
Is that a disappointment?
Thirty wins? A school-record 
start? A Sweet Sixteen run?
The answer to that question 
depends a lot on the person 

being asked. But the fact that 
it’s even being asked is a bell-
wether for where the Wolver-
ines are right now. And your 
answer says a lot about the 
memories you’ve made over the 
last few years and before then.
I’ve only lived in Michigan 
since I’ve been in college, so 
I’m not going to pretend to 
totally understand this part. 
But when Beilein was hired in 
2007, Michigan hadn’t made 
an NCAA Tournament in nine 
years. It won 10 games his first 
season. Even in 2012, Beilein’s 
future with the Wolverines 
wasn’t entirely certain. Now 
he’s headed for the Hall of 
Fame and he’ll be Michigan’s 
coach until he doesn’t want 
to be anymore. It’s easy to 
overlook how this reality was 
hardly fathomable less than a 
decade ago.
This next part, though, is 
much easier for me to under-
stand: 2019 was supposed to be 
something of a rebuilding year.
The Wolverines lost Moritz 
Wagner, Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman and Duncan 
Robinson from what already 
wasn’t the most talented Michi-
gan team in history. Even with 
the addition of Ignas Brazdekis, 
a brash freshman from Ontario, 
this was still a limited roster, as 
every key player suffered from 
some glaring deficiency.
But somehow — despite 
Simpson and Matthews’ come-
and-go shooting, Brazdeikis’ 
inability to pass, Teske’s still-
developing offensive game, 
Jordan Poole’s wildness, Isaiah 
Livers’ passiveness — that ros-
ter came together to the point 
where a third-place finish in 
the Big Ten feels lacking.
The Wolverines were greater 
than the sum of their parts, 
but their deficiencies were still 
present. And when Michigan 
lost, it was easy to see why. 
Everything went wrong against 
Texas Tech, yes, but in ways 

that weren’t hard to see coming 
— only one 3-pointer in 19 tries, 
for instance — even if it was to 
a much greater extent than pre-
dicted. It was simply a loss to a 
better team.
“How many wins, 28 wins, 
right?” Beilein asked after the 
Wolverines lost to Michigan 
State in the Big Ten Tourna-
ment championship game on 
March 14. “We lost four pretty 
good players from last year, 
that took us to the Final Four 
and now all of a sudden, we’re 
not a new team, but we’re not 
an experienced team in playing 
games like this.”
Beilein expressed that senti-
ment more frequently as the 

season drew to a close. Through 
all of Michigan’s shakiness in 
Big Ten play, dwelling too much 
on that could feel like nitpick-
ing. This was still a top-10 team 
that few people outside of the 
program saw coming.
Taken by itself, there’s no 
reason to regard the 2018-19 
season as a disappointment. 
But with the way it began — 
and the years that preceded 
it — it’s easy to be left wanting 
more. It’s natural to be yearn-
ing for the indelible memories 
and unforgettable successes 
of years past that didn’t come 
this season but often felt like 
they should have.
So if we don’t remember 

the 2018-19 Wolverines in the 
same way we remember other 
great Wolverine teams of 
recent years, we’ll still remem-
ber them. Not as a moment, 
necessarily, but as a group of 
the greatest era of Michigan 
basketball history.
Even without the titles. 
Even without the single 
enduring image. Even without 
NCAA Tournament glory.
This was a damn good 
Michigan basketball team. It 
deserves to be remembered 
that way.

Position review: Offensive line

The Michigan football team’s 
most 
important 
addition 
for 
2018 likely wasn’t a new recruit 
or even junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson. Instead, it was new 
offensive line coach Ed Warinner, 
hired to fix what was a major area 
of weakness in the Wolverines’ 
8-5 season in 2017.
While the beginning of the 
2018 season made the much-
maligned offensive line seem 
like more of the same, the unit 
improved throughout the year 
under Warinner’s tutelage. And 
though the season ended with 
a thud in losses to Ohio State 
and Florida, the offensive line’s 
growth under Warinner bodes 
well for the future.
Junior guard Ben Bredeson 
became a leader on the line. 
Elected 
a 
captain 
by 
his 
teammates, Bredeson ended up 
an All-Big Ten Second Team 
selection. Bredeson flirted with 
entering the NFL Draft but 
ultimately told reporters at a pre-
bowl press conference that he 
planned to return for his senior 
year.
Redshirt 
junior 
offensive 
tackle Jon Runyan — who made 
his first career start at left tackle 
in the season opener — was 
named to the coaches’ All-Big 
Ten First Team and joined his 
father in winning the team’s 
award for best offensive lineman 
after steadily improving through 
the course of the season. Junior 
guard Michael Onwenu was 
an All-Big Ten Third Team 
selection.
Though 
Michigan 
loses 
Bushell-Beatty 
to 
graduation, 
Runyan, Bredeson and sophomore 
center Cesar Ruiz — an All-Big 
Ten Third Team honoree — will 
be back to anchor the unit in 
2019. Warinner returns as well, 
hoping to bring consistency back 
to a program once known for its 
bruising offensive linemen.

HIGH POINT: Karan Higdon 
sat at the podium and made a bold 
declaration.
“No question, we have the best 
offensive line in the country.”
Three times in eight minutes, 
the senior running back gave a 
variation of that quote.
To be clear, the Wolverines 
didn’t and don’t have the best 
offensive line in the country. But 
the fact that Higdon — Michigan’s 
top running back — felt like he 
could make that proclamation, 
after all the criticism the line 
received, spoke volumes.
The Wolverines were fresh off 
a win over then-No. 15 Wisconsin 
on Oct. 15. Higdon ran for 105 
yards, partly thanks to the push 

generated by the offensive line. 
The unit had shown improvement 
in earlier games, but those were 
against far inferior opponents. 
This game was a sign that the 
improvement 
was the real deal.
For 
an 
offensive 
line 
that just a month 
before 
had 
to 
defend 
itself 
against all kinds 
of social media 
backlash after a 
season-opening 
loss 
to 
Notre 
Dame, Higdon’s 
declaration was a vindication.
LOW 
POINT: 
Michigan’s 

offensive 
linemen 
promised 
before the season kicked off that 
the unit would be a strength. 
Because the unit had notably 
lacked production the year before 
and 
needed 
replacements 
at 
both 
tackle 
spots, many were 
incredulous.
After 
the 
first 
game 
of 
the season — a 
24-17 loss to the 
Fighting Irish — 
the 
incredulity 
reached a fever 
pitch.
The running game struggled, 
gaining just 58 yards. Patterson 

was sacked three times — one of 
those a strip sack that resulted in 
a lost fumble. Even when he got 
the ball off, Patterson constantly 
had defenders in his face, and 
his highly anticipated Wolverine 
debut ended with a thud.
After the game, the offensive 
line got the lion’s share of the 
blame. Fans blasted it on Twitter, 
laughing at the idea that this 
unit could ever be considered a 
strength. After a season when 
two quarterbacks got hurt behind 
a lacking line, it seemed like 
this would be more of the same. 
Linemen defended themselves, 
maintaining that fans didn’t 
understand the full story. But 
skepticism 
persisted 
until 

Michigan finally demonstrated 
improvement on the field against 
a quality opponent.
THE FUTURE: When fifth-
year 
senior 
offensive 
tackle 
Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty 
got 
injured near the end of the 
season, he sat out both the Ohio 
State game and the Peach Bowl. 
The unit sagged a bit in his 
absence, leaving some question 
marks in the future. However, 
Runyan will return for his final 
season, providing stability and 
leadership at left tackle.
Sophomore offensive tackle 
Andrew Stuber earned the start 
at right tackle against the Gators, 
indicating that he could be the 
next man up. Freshman offensive 
tackle Jalen Mayfield, who saw 
limited snaps in 2018, is another 
who will fight for the open 
tackle job. With an extra year of 
development under their belts, 
the two former four-star recruits 
have 
plenty 
to 
potentially 
contribute.
Ruiz, Bredeson and Onwenu 
return 
for 
another 
year 
to 
anchor the interior offensive 
line. Their experience should 
help onboard younger and less 
experienced starters, and if Ruiz 
and Bredeson can continue the 
momentum from their breakout 
seasons, it could be a boon for the 
Wolverines.
Michigan also landed three 
four-star offensive line recruits 
in tackles Trente Jones and 
Trevor Keegan and guard Nolan 
Rumler. None are likely to start 
right away, but they give the line 
more depth and high potential for 
years to come.
Warinner, too, will coach the 
offensive line again in 2019. His 
results in 2018 — taking a unit 
that was a liability the year before 
and producing four All-Big Ten 
linemen — were promising for 
the future.
This time, with the Wolverines 
going into the season saying their 
offensive line is a strength, it’s a 
lot easier to believe them.

After starting the year as a supposed weakness, Michigan’s offensive line grew into a strength. What’s next in 2019?

Junior guard Ben Bredeson is returning to Michigan for his senior season after a year which saw his unit steadily improve from a team weakness to a strength.

Culture key to season turnaround

This 
past 
weekend, 
the 
Michigan softball team was 
scheduled to play a three-
game series spread out over the 
course of three days at Rutgers. 
Instead, 
the 
coaches 
from both teams decided to 
schedule a doubleheader for 
Saturday, providing Michigan 
the opportunity to fly home 
Saturday night and have an 
extra day in Ann Arbor to relax 
and catch up on homework. But 
instead of adjusting their travel 
plans, the Wolverines stuck 
with their original itinerary and 
spent Sunday on an impromptu 
trip to New York City.
Generally, events like these 
are meant for players and 
coaches alike to bond in hopes 
of building team morale and 
chemistry. And it was evident at 
the beginning of the season that 
Michigan was one of the most 
talented teams in the country 
that also placed a premium on 
team culture.
“I think our team especially 
has fantastic chemistry this 
year,” 
said 
senior 
second 
baseman 
Faith 
Canfield 
on 
Feb. 5. “There’s 
definitely a great 
dynamic among 
our 
players, 
our 
staff, 
our 
coaches, 
and 
our locker room 
and everything. 
Everyone 
works hard and 
everyone’s really 
excited 
to 
be 
here every day.
“I think this program has 
always had, traditionally, a 
strong culture. Our main word 
this year was ‘respect.’ Respect 
Team 
42. 
Whether 
that’s 
respect individually and how 
we treat people or just saying 
things that need to be said 
because we’re respecting the 
goals that we’re going after.”
After an uncharacteristic 9-9 
start that included Michigan 
dropping out of the top-25 
rankings for the first time in 

several years, however, the 
Wolverines’ 
tried-and-true 
morale was tested. Veterans 
struggled 
during 
crucial 
moments and lineup changes 
happened on a 
game-by-game 
basis, especially 
in the infield 
– resulting in 
sloppy play and 
fielding errors.
“(The infield) 
is as good as 
just 
about 
anyone,” 
said 
sophomore first 
baseman Taylor 
Bump after the Big Ten/ACC 
Challenge on Feb. 19. “They 
don’t make it easy for me over 
there, but I know what to expect 
from them and whenever they 
mess up, I’m owning that it’s 
my job to try and help them 
out. So, I think our entire 
infield is working on the trust 
relationship.
“I think that’s something 
we’ll get toward by the end of 
the season.”
However, it seems like the 

team has already gotten there, 
and it’s only halfway through 
the season. The veterans are 
finally stepping up to the box 
and swinging with confidence, 
providing stability to a once-
volatile batting order.
But what’s been more evident 
is that the team’s culture and 
chemistry has given Michigan 
something to fall back on 
throughout this unusual season. 
This 
culture 
has 
given 
freshman outfielder Lexie Blair 
the confidence to take the No. 3 
spot in the batting order and hit 
at a .407 clip – which leads the 
team. This culture has allowed 
freshman 
right-hander 
Alex 
Storako to look up to and learn 
from an All-American pitcher 
in sophomore Meghan Beaubien 
without feeling any pressure. 
This culture has given direction 
to a team that seemed like it was 
it in reverse.
So 
the 
next 
time 
the 
Wolverines spend a day or two 
during their road trips to travel, 
know that this isn’t anything 
new. They’re just following the 
Michigan way. 

Nelson’s fight for a starting spot

This season, senior infielder 
Blake Nelson has the second-
best batting average, the third 
most doubles and is tied for the 
fewest walks from batters with 
more than 50 at-bats on the 
Michigan baseball team.
Though 
Nelson 
was 
the 
opening-day starter at third 
base after playing at that 
position most of last year, he 
had a flaw — his defense.
In just the second game of 
the season, Nelson made a 
mistake. And then another, 
and another, and another; he 
had four errors that day — two 
throwing, two fielding. He was 
a liability.
That liability was quickly 
taken care of. Nelson didn’t 
play the next game, and was 
the designated hitter for the 
next series, a placeholder while 
junior 
outfielder 
Dominic 
Clementi 
was 
recovering 
from an abdominal sprain he 
suffered early in the season. 
When 
Clementi 
returned, 
Nelson had one pinch-hitting 
opportunity in seven games 
and he struck out.
Nelson was relegated to 

covering 
shifts. 
He 
didn’t 
play in big games and only 
got the opportunity to prove 
himself when senior infielder 
Ako Thomas’ nagging injury 
deemed 
that 
the 
second 
baseman would need a weekend 
to rest.
In his first game in two 
weeks against Manhattan, he 
went 3-for-4 with two RBIs 
and two doubles.
“He had a great night,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
after the game against the 
Jaspers. “It’s even more special 
because he hasn’t played in a 
while and it would be very easy 
for him to come out and use the 
lack of playing time as a reason 
for not being in a rhythm to 
do well, but he’s been a great 
teammate even when he’s not 
in there. It’s great for a guy to 
have success because of the 
type of teammate that he is.”
Added Nelson: “It starts 
with 
our 
team. 
We’re 
all 
bought in for win. Whether 
that’s warming up with the 
outfielders, doing the chart or 
playing in the game. It doesn’t 
really matter, we all know our 
roles and we’re all ready to 
come in when our number is 
called.”

It wasn’t a fluke. Over the 
next three games, Nelson hit at 
a .583 clip with five RBIs.
“We saw that this weekend, 
he’s going to be a hard guy 
to keep out of the lineup,” 
Bakich said. “I really like what 
Blake brings from an energy 
standpoint, and offensively he 
just brings a knack for quality 
at-bats 
and 
making 
hard 
contacts. He delivered some 
clutch hits.”
Unless Nelson experiences 
another drastic collapse of 
defensive 
competence, 
a 
replacement won’t be needed 
for a while. His two competitors 
— Thomas and Clementi — 
have two of the worst batting 
and slugging percentages on 
the team and are both plagued 
by injuries, the same reason 
Nelson got his chance in the 
first place.
Meanwhile, 
Nelson 
has 
been firing on all cylinders. 
His defense has been nearly 
impeccable — just two more 
errors — and his offense has 
been invaluable, hitting .377 
with 14 RBIs since the game 
against Manhattan. Even if 
there were people to take his 
spot they would be hard pressed 
to replicate his performances.

Repaint the wall, Annie Hall: 
Rethinking Ann Arbor’s 
bookstore mural


F

or the past few months, my col-
umn has covered hefty topics 
such as Facebook data breaches, 
Blackberry’s pivotal strategy and Bud 
Light’s false advertising. This week, I am 
switching things up and digging into the 
economics of something worth far more 
than the multibillion dollar bottom lines 
of corporations: joy.
It’s been a while since many of us took 
Economics 101, but most remember the 
first fundamental pillar of microeco-
nomics: supply and demand. Demand 
illustrates how much of a product or ser-
vice is wanted by consumers at a certain 
price, and supply represents how much 
the market can offer. When consumers 
buy more electric vehicles, the demand 
for gas decreases. When a drought ruins 
a strawberry harvest, consumer demand 
is often higher than the number of straw-
berries available, and the price of straw-
berries jumps. But what happens when 
supply is infinite and the price is $0? An 
economist’s nightmare and a consumer’s 
dream, this is a commodity named joy.
S

o, what exactly is joy?
A barista who compliments 
your haircut. The sun peeking out 
on a cloudy day. “Congratulations” in the 
subject line at the top of your inbox. At a 
university that demands enduring focus 
and a pervasive culture of “multi-taskers 
or nothing,” our minds gravitate to things 
outside of our control in order to find 
what we call joy. After all, we don’t have 
time on our calendars to pursue grandi-
ose activities with the sole purpose of 
comfort.
And the world isn’t wrong when it tells 
us that there is joy in the little things. 
But the problem with “the little things,” 
or even the big things that bring us hap-
piness, is that they are circumstances 
often out of our control. While I admit to 
euphoria in the face of a sunny day and 
an unhesitating grin in exchange for a 
compliment, I believe there is a sizable 
concept we miss in our quest for joy: joy 
in perspective.
But what does economics have to do 
with it? Take mornings, for example. 
Many of us wake up to our alarms with 
two goals in mind: maximize sleep and 
get to class on time. Every hindrance 
along the way contributes to our vexation, 

and our unrelenting focal point is to sim-
ply beat the clock. One missed breakfast 
too many, and we find ourselves confront-
ing what inevitably becomes a bad day.
Welcome to marginal analysis. In eco-
nomics, marginal analysis examines the 
benefits of an activity compared to the 
additional costs incurred of continuing 
that activity. In the pursuit of joy, positiv-
ity can often prove to be the more expen-
sive option compared to pessimism.
When positive, perspective takes on 
a snowball effect. One positive thought 
prompts our brains to seek another, and 
we watch our attitude build on optimism 
as the snowball runs its course. This illus-
trates increasing marginal returns. But 
the hardest part is packing 
the first snowball, or rather, 
seeking out our first positive 
thought. This is an upfront cost 
to consider in our marginal 
analysis of joy.
Yet when a perspective is 
negative, the opposite of the 
snowball effect occurs: The 
domino effect. Since negative 
thoughts are easier to conjure, 
they reproduce in our brains 
quicker causing us to seek out 
complaints more frequently. 
Unlike the snowball effect 
which reaps positive marginal 
effects as positive thoughts 
gain 
momentum, 
negative 
thinking occurs quickly and 
effortlessly — like standing 
dominoes.
To understand the human 
tendency to pursue the cheap-
er, negative perspective, con-
sider common conversation: 
“It’s finally nice outside.” “My 
day has been good, can’t com-
plain.” Can’t complain. This is 
our tainted rendition of posi-
tivity — a mere extension of 
negativity. Because joy comes 
at a cost measured by the cur-
rency of our effort, marginal 
analysis deems negativity to 
be cheaper. There is no upfront 
cost to set the domino effect in 
motion.
Just as we can’t control posi-
tive occurrences, we can’t con-

trol their negative counterparts either. 
Economics shows us that negativity is 
easier, but one concept trumps any temp-
tation to abandon joy in perspective: 
opportunity cost.
When we choose joy, we trade in effort 
to focus on what is going right. We choose 
celebration and we choose organic ener-
gy. We abandon the easy and elect the 
challenge to reap its subsequent benefits. 
On hard days, it is a hefty price to pay. 
Complaint runs in our culture and we 
aren’t trained to run against the grain. 
But the fruits of this labor are generous; 
when we choose optimism, we develop 
the capability to control the definition of 
our good and bad days.

At the heart of economics rests the 
acknowledgement that human behav-
ior can only be modeled into supply and 
demand graphs to an extent. Ultimately, 
we are irrational. We make decisions 
spontaneously and sometimes need a day 
to relish in gloom. But the value is found 
in taking the variable cost of positive 
thought into a long-term consideration. 
The practice of continually choosing joy 
will pay higher dividends than continu-
ing our rituals of negativity. The supply of 
both is perpetually in surplus, but it is up 
to us to fuel our demand of joy.
In support of Stress Awareness Month, 
happy April.

Do you 
know 
your 
options?

F

rom the viral spread of the 
#MeToo movement to the brave 
testimony of Dr. Christine Bla-
sey Ford, it’s not a secret that sexual 
violence is pervasive in our society. 
However, we are now living in a politi-
cal and social climate where many sur-
vivors of sexual violence are feeling a 
sense of empowerment to speak up about 
their experiences. It’s a time of increased 
awareness, accountability and ultimate-
ly, a call for change.
Living during this important time for 
social change, I began wondering how 
my own community, the University of 
Michigan, can better inform students 
about this situation. While organizations 
that you may be familiar with (e.g. the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center) and the University admin-
istration should continue to focus on 
preventative efforts, it’s equally impor-
tant for these institutions to understand 
that sexual violence on college campuses 
is indeed a widespread issue that stu-
dents and universities must be equipped 
to handle.
The addition of an in-person hearing 
— a process that allows students who 
have been involved in sexual miscon-
duct allegations to ask questions of each 
other and witnesses — to the Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy motivated me 
to write my senior honors thesis titled 
“Legal Underpinnings and Implications 
of Sexual Assault on College Campuses: 
Perceptions, Attitudes and Policy Rec-
ommendations.” My thesis focused on 
the potential implications of the changes 
to the SSMP and student’s knowledge 
about reporting sexual misconduct on 

this campus. Are these changes help-
ful? Are students informed about them? 
Are these attempts by the University 
to reform reporting sexual misconduct 
enough?
Prior to the adoption of this interim 
policy, students were able to circum-
vent many of these legal proceedings, 
including an in-person hearing, and 
report directly to the University. When 
I began at the University of Michigan, 
survivors had the option to report to the 
University about their experiences. In 
response to these allegations, the Uni-
versity may have responded by changing 
a student’s classes or moving their dorm. 
In contrast, students could report to law 
enforcement where they would have a 
formal trial. However, the adoption of 
this policy blurs the line between the 
traditional criminal justice system and 
the ways the University approaches sex-
ual misconduct. With this policy change, 
in the eyes of many, what was once two 
distinct ways of reporting sexual mis-
conduct coalesces into two indistin-
guishable options.
As such, with the number of reported 
incidents expected to decrease, I wanted 
to collect data surrounding students’ per-
ceptions of reporting and adjudicating 
sexual misconduct on campus. To gain 
an understanding of what is currently 
available to survivors, I had conversa-
tions with various offices on campus 
(i.e., SAPAC, Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services, Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment and Division of Public Safety and 
Security). My goal with these conversa-
tions was to identify what makes their 
office unique and especially valuable to 

survivors. For example, CAPS is geared 
toward creating positive mental path-
ways while SAPAC services can help 
with crisis intervention and can help 
survivors formulate an individualized 
healing plan.
Building off of these conversations 
with campus officials, I interviewed 
students across all three University of 
Michigan campuses—Ann Arbor, Dear-
born and Flint. I asked students vari-
ous questions including what resources 
they would recommend if a friend came 
to them after experiencing intimate 
partner violence or sexual assault. The 
results from a sample of 32 participants 
indicated that half of the participants 
said they did not know of any on or off 
campus resources to which they would 
direct a friend.
The lack of awareness of the inter-
viewed students was disturbing and per-
plexing. For many students, reporting is 
not an option they are interested in pur-
suing. However, for those who are inter-
ested in exploring their options, how can 
students feel safe when they don’t even 
know where to report their grievances or 
seek resources?
Currently, the University has various 
prevention programs in place. U-M Ann 
Arbor offers a three-step process for all 
incoming undergraduates. This includes 
an online module about alcohol and sex-
ual violence; the peer-delivered program 
Relationship Remix, aimed at teaching 
college freshmen about consent, person-
al values, and healthy relationships; and 
a bystander intervention program called 
Change it Up!, which is delivered as a 
skit-based performance by students.

U-M Flint and U-M Dearborn also 
offer online programs to educate their 
incoming students. The University needs 
to consider whether efforts solely target-
ing incoming students (freshmen and 
transfer students) are sufficient to pro-
vide education related to campus mis-
conduct policies and reporting options. 
At least from a reporting standpoint, 
with 50 percent of my sample unclear of 
where to report, it seems that these edu-
cational programs are clearly not suffi-
cient.
It’s difficult to say with certainty how 
the new policy will be embraced by stu-
dents on campus. However, what is clear 
is that students do not have adequate 
knowledge of current campus resources.
It might be instinctual to blame the 
University for these lapses in knowledge, 
as many students in my sample did. How-
ever, it is also equally likely that students 
are part of the problem. Despite the 
known prevalence of sexual misconduct 
on college campuses, no student wants 
to think that they or someone they know 
will ever be in need of reporting sexual 
misconduct or of survivor-centered ser-
vices.
A knowledgeable and aware student 
body requires the efforts of both stu-
dents and the University. As a tangible 
product of my thesis and in hopes that 
my research will help students under-
stand what resources exist on our cam-
pus, I created a graphic. My hope is that 
this resource will educate students, 
emphasize the importance of knowing 
your options, and prove that you are never 
alone at the University of Michigan.

Repaint the wall, Annie Hall: Rethinking 
Ann Arbor’s bookstore mural

Wednesday, April 3, 2019 // The Statement 
 

I 

have walked past the “Bookstore 
Mural” hundreds of times during my 
two years living in Ann Arbor. When-
ever my errands drag me across the Diag, 
my heels instinctively turn the corner and 
put me onto the perpetually busy street of 
East Liberty. I find myself momentarily dis-
tracted from whatever music I have blaring 
through my earphones, and I glance up to see 
it, exactly where it has been since 1984.
Situated kitty-cornered from the fluores-
cent glow of the State Theatre and just down 
the way from the light-bulb encrusted Michi-
gan Theater sign, it looms over downtown 
as one of the city’s most prominent pieces of 
public art. Beautiful and deliberate strokes of 
red, yellow and blue accentuate the features 
of the five portraits that are laid upon a con-
trasting black background, coming together 
to create what is colloquially known as the 
“Bookstore Mural.” The memorialized are 
writers Anaïs Nin, Franz Kafka, Hermann 
Hesse and Edgar Allan Poe — as well as 
screenwriter and filmmaker Woody Allen.
Painted in 1984 by artist Richard Wolk, 
a University of Michigan alum, the mural 
stands on the side of what was originally 
David’s Books and Discount Records. Later, 
Borders Books was located next to the mural. 
As reported by The Michigan Daily during 
the mural’s production, Wolk had previ-
ous experience creating public art, having 
painted a mural of famous figures on a record 
store on South University Avenue the year 
before. He then took his talents to the owner 
of David’s Books, Ed Koster, who commis-
sioned the piece in order to replace an exist-
ing mural that was deemed unsatisfactory by 
the State Street Area Association, a merchant 
group that aimed to increase business in the 
area.
After the mural’s completion, however, 
this same group of critics did not give the 
replacement much praise. As it was put by 
Ann Arbor News reporter Charles Child in a 
July 8, 1984 report, “Oftentimes, years must 
pass before great art is finally appreciated 
by the public. Perhaps the mural needs more 
time.”
It has been 34 years since its creation, and 
the “Bookstore Mural” remains one of Ann 
Arbor’s most symbolic images. Appearing on 
seemingly every promotional video, social 
media post or Ann Arbor must-see list, the 
mural has become visually synonymous with 
downtown and the Ann Arbor community. 
This recognizability has increased since its 
2010 restoration, when Wolk estimated it 
would not need to be re-touched for another 
10 years. Wolk claimed he would again do 
the restoration, but also noted that if Oxford 
Property Management — the owner of the 

building the mural is on — wanted to replace 
it with another mural in the future, he would 
pass the opportunity on to a new, younger 
artist.
It’s been nine years since this restoration, 
and maybe it is time for the Ann Arbor com-
munity to start thinking about the mural’s 
next touch-up. When looking at the authors 
included in the mural, Woody Allen stands 
out for more than his film career. Having been 
accused of sexually assaulting a minor, he 
was thrown into a controversy that involved 
his image, work and influence on the film 
industry. Is this something Ann Arbor wants 
to promote through its public art?
T

he allegations against Woody Allen 
date back to Aug 5, 1992 when 
he was accused of molesting his 
7-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan Far-
row. The allegation came to light along with 
the revelation of his affair with the adopted 
daughter of his long-term partner Mia Far-
row, 21 year-old Soon-Yi Previn. This affair 
is claimed to have begun when Allen was 56 
years old. He confirmed the relationship in a 
press release on August 18, 1992 — the same 
day the Connecticut State Police announced 
an investigation regarding Dylan’s abuse 
allegations. Four days before, Allen had filed a 
lawsuit for custody of his and Farrow’s three 
children — the mutually adopted Moses and 
Dylan Farrow, as well as their biological son 
Ronan Farrow.
After seven months of inquiry, Allen’s 
lawyers announced on March 19, 1993 that 
he was cleared of the molestation charges, 
despite Farrow’s lawyer claiming the report, 
done by a team of child abuse investigators 
from Yale-New Haven Hospital that were 
brought in by Connecticut State Police, to be 
“incomplete and inaccurate.” The custody 
battle began the next day, which led to over 
two months of trial, until its verdict in Mia 
Farrow’s favor on June 7, 1993.
Acting Justice Elliott Wilk claimed Allen 
is “self-absorbed, untrustworthy and insensi-
tive,” also denying him visitation with Dylan. 
Frank Maco, a state’s attorney from Con-
necticut, announced he would not further 
try Allen for the abuse against Dylan despite 
probable cause, as he did not want to subject 
her to further trauma through the trial.
Over the next 26 years, these allegations 
continued to be supported by the Farrow 
family. Dylan went on the record for the first 
time in 2013.
“There’s a lot I don’t remember,” she told 
Vanity Fair, “but what happened in the attic 
I remember. I remember what I was wearing 
and what I wasn’t wearing.”
Since this interview, Dylan has consis-
tently and publicly supported her accusa-

tions through an open letter to The New York 
Times in 2014 and an op-ed for the Los Ange-
les Times in 2017. Both Mia and Ronan Far-
row have shown public support for Dylan’s 
story, questioning the lack of accountability 
toward Allen and writing their own pieces in 
defense of her, like Ronan’s 2016 guest col-
umn for The Hollywood Reporter asserting 
his belief in his sister and documenting her 
struggles.
T

he downtown mural featuring 
Allen and his controversy was 
an early part of the mental map I 
began building for myself when I first came 
to the University. As an amateur artist and 
someone who finds joy in the works of oth-
ers, this piece used to mean a quick smile and 
feeling of warmth. The stark contrast of light 
and dark, white and color would lift my mood 
and prompt my admiration before I was again 
bopping along, my music intact. But early this 
semester, my friend Sophie ReVeal, an LSA 
sophomore studying Film, Television and 
Media, began a conversation with me about 
the impact of having certain idealized images 
within our community — like this glorified 
portrait of Woody Allen.
The question of how to regard influential 
artists after allegations of sexual misconduct 
has become a difficult debate in recent years, 
especially when their body of work is signi-
fied as having notable cultural capital. At the 
time of the mural’s creation, Woody Allen 
was regarded as the hip, progressive and 
culturally relevant filmmaker — and even 
today, he maintains recognition in the film 
industry. His 1977 Academy-Award-winning 
“Annie Hall” is considered one of the earli-
est and most successful romantic comedies, 
and his emphasis on incorporating nervous 
humor into his films has made him one of the 
most well-known and appealing filmmakers 
of the modern era.
With these oustanding allegations against 
him, the question, Can you separate the art-
ist from the art? is more than warranted. 
And this question is doubled when referring 
to the mural, as it layers the issue by having 
to think not only of Wolk and his art, but the 
lives and artistic work of the five featured 
artists as well.
This question becomes difficult to answer 
when an artist has made notable cultural and 
academic influences. And this same argu-
ment stands for Woody Allen, whose cultural 
influence on American cinema seems to be 
unignorable. A 24-time Oscar nominee and 
a four-time winner, Allen has been charming 
audiences since his emergence in the 1970s. 
However, is there a way to acknowledge this 
historical importance without creating pub-
lic glorifications of him?

The subjects of the “Bookstore Mural” are 
understandably linked to the piece, as each is 
a prominent author. However, Woody Allen 
has more of an industrial connection to the 
mural, which is placed within sight of both 
the Michigan and State theaters. But is his 
image truly the best representation of what 
the film industry is? And if this image were 
to be changed, would that be erasing history, 
or simply avoiding a personal glorification of 
him?
LSA senior Sophia Georginis is studying 
both communication studies and Film, Tele-
vision and Media. She is currently one of the 
general managers of WOLV TV, a student-
produced television network on campus, and 
works with Sisters in Cinema, an organiza-
tion intending to give female and non-binary 
filmmakers a chance to tell their stories. She 
said she is in favor of erasing Allen from the 
mural due to the abundance of other film 
icons without assault allegations.
“I don’t think it’s erasing him from his-
tory as much as it is putting people up on 
that mural who haven’t sexually assaulted 
somebody. There’s so many people that have 
impacted film — there’s so many women, so 
many people of color that have impacted film 
and have made changes. Greta Gerwig, Spike 
Lee, so many people that I can just name 
here.”
She also spoke on Allen’s existing influence 
on the film industry, stating that his position 
in academia is secure regardless of his place 
on a piece of public art.
“Yes, he has made impacts to the film 
industry,” Georginis said. “But it’s also like 
so many people have who haven’t done these 
disgusting things. And we’re not erasing him 
by taking him off that mural, he’s very much 
so in people’s memory. But it’s like putting 
somebody up on that mural that shows what 
the film industry is and where we’re moving.”
This attitude toward academic acknowl-
edgement is echoed by another LSA senior 
studying Film, Television and Media, Maria 
Mikhailova, who works as outreach coordi-
nator for Sisters in Cinema. In terms of the 
academic uses of film, Mikhailova said there 
is a way to keep relevant directors in the con-
versation without glorifying them and keep-
ing them in positions of power.
“It’s just a matter of being transparent 
and saying, ‘This is why I want to show this 
film,’” Mikhailova said. “It’s not because this 
person in particular did it, it’s because this 
particular scene is relevant to what we’re 
studying right now. If we eliminate everyone 
who’s ever had allegations against them or 
anything like that, then we don’t have any-
thing to study.”
This academic debate around the relevance 

and usability of Allen’s work remains justifi-
able, but this doesn’t seem to reflect directly 
on the use of his imagery and personal brand 
as a cultural symbol. To that point, Mikhailo-
va also spoke in support of the idea of more 
worthy subjects for the community.
“It’s not erasure of history, it’s just making 
way of better history, for celebration of better 
history,” Mikhailova said.
These questions of erasure versus glorifi-
cation were touched upon in a conversation 
I had with Tara Ward, a lecturer in the His-
tory of Art Department, who also has vested 
interest in gender issues. Ward said the battle 
between these combating ideas is a compli-
cated conversation that should be dealt with 
seriously.
“(This) essentially (is) the debate. Is this 
about history, or is this about our contempo-
rary values?” Ward said. “And it’s a hard call, 
and you know, it’s unclear what’s broadly the 
right thing to do politically. White-washing 
history doesn’t stop it from happening it 
again, but allowing for a celebration of prob-
lematic figures is equally an issue. And so it 
does become, I think, a case-by-case choice.”
And in terms of a case-by-case decision, 
Ward said it is important to look at both the 
historical and modern context surrounding a 
piece of discussion in order to come to mea-
sured choices.
I

n the fall of 2017, #MeToo was pushed 
to the forefront of societal conversa-
tion as the hashtag gained a strong 
following on Twitter, revitalizing the move-
ment that activist Tarana Burke began in 
2006. This then spurred the Time’s Up move-
ment, which was created with the intention 
of stopping widespread abuse by men in the 
workplace. The growth of these movements 
has increased social awareness of sexual 
assault and harassment, publicly challenging 
powerful, influential men who exploit their 
positions of power, and sometimes are still 
able to retain strong levels of cultural weight 
after allegations become public. 
Also during the fall of 2017, strong inves-
tigative reporting uncovered suppressed sto-
ries of abuse and brought survivors of assault 
to the public eye, playing a crucial role in 
increasing public awareness of institution-
al issues like sexual assault. One of these 
reporters is Ronan Farrow, Woody Allen’s 
son, who broke the Harvey Weinstein scan-
dal in October 2017 in a piece for The New 
Yorker. His reporting opened the floodgates 
for a series of journalistic pieces regarding 
similar systems of abuse.
Farrow and Ken Auletta visited the Uni-
versity on March 19 for a Wallace House 
event. Auletta, another reporter for The New 
Yorker, took a moment during the event to 

briefly comment on Farrow’s connection to 
Woody Allen, citing it as his initial concern 
over Farrow’s motivations to pursue these 
stories. Farrow’s response to these claims, 
then and now, is that his sister’s abuse func-
tioned as a contribution to his passion, not a 
conflict of interest.
Farrow used the event to speak to the big 
strides that were made in these movements, 
but referenced the remaining changes that 
need to occur.
“I don’t think we’ve achieved accountabil-
ity … I don’t think we’ve extended the tenta-
tive steps towards accountability to all the 
segments of society that desperately need it,” 
Farrow said.
And in order to promote that much-needed 
accountability, Farrow claimed we need to 
“keep holding their feet to the fire.”
A

nd how do we do that? A clear place 
to start seems to be one’s own com-
munity. It’s easy enough to broadly 
and indirectly recognize the existence of 
power structures and imbalances that give 
certain people greater authority. It’s more 
difficult to look internally and see the ways 
one’s own city is supporting problematic 
people, like Ann Arbor’s inclusion of Woody 
Allen in the “Bookstore Mural.” But this type 
of identification takes self-reflective work 
that is often strenuous to community memo-
ries and values.
While speaking with Ysabel Bautista, an 
Ann Arborite and LSA sophomore studying 
biopsychology, cognition and neuroscience, 
she reflected on her experiences seeing the 
mural as a staple piece of public art in Ann 
Arbor.
“My mom and I used to go (to Borders 
bookstore) every weekend to get books, and 
then we’d walk down to Ben and Jerry’s and 
get ice cream, so when you’d turn that corner 
you’d see that mural,” Bautista said. “Every 
time I think of that mural I think of … going 
to Borders to buy books with my mom.”
This 
type 
of 
emotional 
attachment 
enhances the need for productive communi-
ty dialogue about questionable public works 
in order to understand dissenting opinions. 
Bautista did, however, note her understand-
ing of community concerns after reflecting 
on her new perspective as a student rather 
than a local Ann Arbor resident.
“I feel like everyone who’s lived in Ann 
Arbor who goes to the University of Michi-
gan, you just see Ann Arbor in a different 
light when you’re living on campus because 
now you see perspectives of people who 
aren’t from Ann Arbor,” Bautista said. “And 
you’re like, ‘Oh wow, maybe Ann Arbor’s not 
as picture-perfect as I thought it was before.’”
Public art can act as a representation of 

a community, blending together an artist’s 
intention and the values of the place where 
their art resides, seemingly bringing the resi-
dents of an area together in acceptance of an 
image. But this does not necessarily need to 
be a permanent assertion of personal or com-
munity value. As perceived by Art and Design 
freshman Gabe Consiglio, art is allowed to 
change with the times given our new cultural 
landscape.
“With learning of allegations like the ones 
against Woody Allen, I don’t think an art-
ist should be obligated to keep that stance 
that they had when they originally made 
the piece,” Consiglio said. “So I think if they 
wanted to, they definitely should be able to 
go in and change it based on new informa-
tion that they learned. Because opinions on 
that should be ever-changing, you know, you 
shouldn’t ever need to hold the same stance 
on one issue. So I think definitely art is some-
thing that can be revisited and tweaked.”
Making a point of calling out damaging 
imagery or perpetuations of unfair power 
structures, like those that allow for the exal-
tation of prominent men like Woody Allen, is 
how community perceptions can be adjust-
ed to champion more conscientious values. 
Being able to rally behind a change, or at the 
very least, generate a greater conversation 
about what our art says about our commu-
nity, is how a community is able to challenge 
its own internalization of social hierarchies.
By continuing to talk to ReVeal, it has 
become clear that a conversation needs to be 
had about the art that is so prominently dis-
played in Ann Arbor.
“If we’re allowing someone who has hor-
rible allegations against them in this public 
space, we’re perpetuating this idea that men 
who have done things like this can remain 
in power because of (professional) things 
that they’ve done, and we’re not taking into 
account the whole picture,” ReVeal said.
ReVeal and I are now in the early stages of 
reaching out to property owners and affili-
ates with the mural to start a broader con-
versation within the Ann Arbor community 
about the type of imagery that we promote. 
Woody Allen’s history of abuse exists clearly 
in downtown, but remains ignored in favor 
of an artistic glorification of his cultural 
impact. What exactly should happen to the 
mural is unclear, and requires the engage-
ment and perspectives of the entire Ann 
Arbor community. But the city must take 
some agency over what is being displayed in 
their own backyard, because, in the words 
of lecturer Ward, “No painting, no film, no 
technical ability should let you get out of the 
ethical rules of humanity.”

isa nearly dropped the plate she 
was cleaning when she heard 
a large truck door slam shut. It 
was the new neighbors at last. She opened 
her curtains wide, allowing sunshine to 
burn the dark, dustless countertops, and 
peered out of her kitchen window. They 
were a typical young family: a husband, a 
pregnant wife and a toddler in a stroller. 
They looked nice enough, but she couldn’t 
tell much about them yet. She just hoped 
that they wouldn’t be anything like the last 
ones. The husband put his arm around the 
wife. He stood half a foot above her, just 
enough so that she could place her perfect, 
brown curls on his perfect, sturdy shoul-
der and look longingly at their new house 
together. They stared at the two-story 
house, and Lisa stared too. It was similar to 
Lisa’s house, just like all the houses in the 
neighborhood. The outsides looked differ-
ent of course: different colored brick, dif-
ferent shapes of windows and sometimes 
a different colored door. Yet, the insides 
were all the same. The staircase was on the 
right just as you got in, the living room on 
the left and the kitchen straightforward. 
All relatively the same size and structure, 
but you wouldn’t know from looking at 
just the outside. The husband and the wife 
turned back to facing each other. They 
stared longingly at each other, stared long-
ingly for their future together. Lisa stared, 
too.
When Jill and Todd, the old neighbors, 
moved out, she was so relieved. She could 
breathe the fresh, free-of-Jill-and-Todd-
air now when she stepped outside. The 
new “sold” sign in front of their house cre-

ated such an excitement in Lisa that she 
made cookies to welcome the new neigh-
bors. So far, she had made four batches. 
Batches one and three were too burnt, 
batch two had fallen to the ground and 
batch four was perfect but made prema-
turely. This fourth batch had been sitting 
in a Tupperware bowl waiting for the new 
neighbors for three weeks until they got 
stale and it was time for them to be thrown 
away. Now, after six weeks, the neighbors 
were here, but she had no cookies for them.
A new list of priorities instantly 
appeared in Lisa’s mind. Her unfinished 
dishes fell to the bottom of the list and a 
fifth batch of cookies for the new neigh-
bors rose urgently to the top. She gath-
ered the materials, followed her recipe, 
and mixed the ingredients together while 
looking outside her kitchen window.
Light from the outside could barely 
sneak past the thick curtains of Lisa’s 
window into her dimly lit kitchen, but 
she adjusted them just enough so she 
could peek through and watch the neigh-
bors move in. The stacks of boxes getting 
unpacked made her question if moving was 
ever really worth it. There was the physi-
cal labor of moving everything, of course, 
but there was also the mental labor. Leav-
ing a place that’s comfortable, a place that 
makes sense, and going to a place where 
your whole life just becomes about trying 
to adjust to it. She was just happy that Jill 
and Todd made this sacrifice.
The neighbors were on a break now. 
She watched them chat and monitored 
their expressions. The couple was social-
izing with the movers. They all had bright 

eyes, glowing faces, shining smiles. When 
they laughed it looked genuine, like they 
were actually enjoying themselves. The 
wife’s hair would fly through the wind as 
she threw her head forward with laugh-
ter. The husband’s strong hands would 
slap his thighs as if the laughter was too 
much for him. She wondered what kind of 
jokes existed that would create so much 
laughter when first meeting someone. The 
neighbors began to point out things to the 
movers, asking them questions, or some-
thing, but suddenly they looked at Lisa 
like they could see her right through her 
window. She could swear right then that 
their laughter turned to frowns, disgust 
and irritation. The sun burned their faces. 
Their skin turned a bright red. Maybe they 
knew this was her fifth batch and the cook-
ies weren’t ready on time. Whatever it was, 
Lisa knew she made a bad first impression 
and all she could hope for was that the 
cookies would taste good enough to make 
up for it. When the neighbors turned back 
away, Lisa closed the curtains and began 
to mix with more fury.
Soon enough all the ingredients became 
one consistent bowl of dough ready to 
again be separated from the rest onto a 
pan. Lisa scooped the mixture out, making 
several even piles of dough one and half 
inches in diameter. She had such a good 
eye for measurements that she didn’t need 
a ruler anymore while she baked, but at 
that moment she was having trouble see-
ing. The brightness of the sun was still 
affecting her vision, creating more and 
more dark spots every time she blinked. 
Lisa placed the spoon down back into the 

bowl and pressed her fingers to her eyes 
trying to get them to adjust. Each time she 
closed her eyes for too long, the sight of the 
neighbor’s frowns would appear and take 
over her vision. She had trouble remem-
bering the size of their noses or the width 
of their eyes, but she knew exactly what 
their frowns looked like.Judging frowns, 
hateful frowns, they burned her brain.
She opened her eyes back up and felt 
adjusted to the comfortable, dim lighting 
of her kitchen. However, even when she 
went back to scooping, she couldn’t get 
the image of their frowns out of her mind. 
With each scoop, Lisa couldn’t help but 
continue to ponder the details of the inter-
action she just had with the new neighbors. 
With each scoop she became more anxious 
to know why on Earth her new neighbors 
reacted this way. By the time she was at the 
scoop that ended the third row of cook-
ies, Lisa knew why the neighbors were 
disgusted by her. She started to slam the 
cookie dough onto the pan, careless about 
the evenness, and imagined each one as 
the heads of Jill and Todd. Every other 
scoop would be Jill then Todd, Jill then 
Todd, getting what they deserve. Because 
Lisa knew it was their fault. They had told 
the neighbors every bad thing about her, 
lies about her, just to get back at her. This 
infuriated Lisa, but still, she had hope that 
the sweetness of the cookies would change 
their mind about her. She quickly fixed the 
unevenness in the last row and threw the 
pan into the oven.
The question continued to pound inside 
Lisa’s head. She didn’t actually know what 
Jill and Todd would’ve told the new neigh-
bors, since she rarely allowed herself to be 
seen by them. But maybe Lisa was a bad 
neighbor in ways that she didn’t even real-
ize. Maybe they could hear her TV playing 
too loud, too late on those nights when she 
couldn’t sleep or they could tell when she 
was late mowing her lawn and her grass 
had grown too long next to theirs. Every 
morning when she left early for work, she 
could see their lights turn on as she pulled 
out of the driveway as if the sound of her 
car had woken them up. And every night 
when she came back home late and they 
were sitting on their porch, Jill and Todd 
would wave to her. The wave itself was like 
any friendly, neighborly wave, but their 
eyes were squinted as if they were focused 
on something else. Sometimes it was star-
ing at her grass that was too long, or her 
car that was too loud, and sometimes it 
was just an exhausted look that told Lisa 
that their misery was her fault.

Is the craft blog dead?

T

he first blog I ever read reli-
giously was called “Mod Podge 
Rocks.” It was 2011 and I was 
a devoted decoupager. In fact, I was 
so devoted that my birthday wish list 
resembled the Pinterest board of a shab-
by chic bride; all I wanted was mason 
jars, tissue paper, burlap, and buttons. I 
looked forward to the Sunday morning 
newspaper delivery purely because of 
the craft store coupons and the animat-
ed color explosion from the pages of the 
Michael’s and JoAnn’s advertisements. I 
still remember the home economic les-
son from my mother: Never go to a craft 
store without a coupon.
“Mod Podge Rocks” was founded by 
the Northwestern mom turned craft 
blogger, Amy Anderson, and I read her 
daily posts like gospel. When Anderson 
posted “How to Paint a Colorful Clock 
Face” I ran straight up to my room 
and unhooked my Target clock from 
my bedroom wall, eager to follow her 
step-by-step instructions. After some 
mechanical twiddling, I decoupaged 
the clock face with patterned scrapbook 
paper. Admittedly, after waiting the 
24-hour drying period, the clock never 
ticked again.
As Anderson gained notoriety in the 
blogosphere, I became an even more 
enthusiastic fan of Mod Podge. When 
she published a book with directions of 
how to Mod Podge everything from a 
bike helmet to acorns, I of course bought 
the book and completed all the projects. 
 
Certainly, as a 12-year-old blog read-
er, I was a rare breed. I didn’t grow up 
with the rise of Myspace and LiveJour-
nal that ushered in the era of the blog-
ger. And Instagram had not yet become 
mainstream when I was reading blogs in 
middle school. The year 2011 was a rare 

in-between time in the social media 
landscape where the next big technol-
ogy platform had not been determined 
by the masses yet.
Yet, by the time I reached eighth 
grade, the list of blogs bookmarked 
under “Shannon’s Blogs” on the fam-
ily computer had grown. Added to my 
daily diet of “Mod Podge Rocks” was 
the trendier “A Beautiful Mess” craft 
blog. Founded by two sisters, the blog 
widened my purview of crafting beyond 
the water base sealer, glue and finish of 
Mod Podge.
That summer, I spent countless craft-
ernoons inspired by a slate of bloggers 
to attempt the most ridiculous do-it-
yourself projects. I made a mesh ribbon 
wreath. Concocted a clay formula for 
Christmas ornaments. Ordered bees-
wax from Etsy to make candles. Pressed 
flowers. Scrapbooked. Dyed fabric. 
Beaded chunky necklaces. Sewed a 
skirt.
I even stuffed dozens of cucumber 
spears into mason jars in an attempt to 
make a batch of pickles. After eagerly 
waiting a week for 
them to ferment, I 
learned only certain 
types of cucumbers 
are 
appropriate 
specimens for pick-
ling. Most picklers 
agree Kirby Cukes 
are the best. I 
unfortunately 
did not use 
Kirby Cukes. 
Instead 
of 
crisp 
pick-
les, I was 

left with soggy cucumbers. But it didn’t 
matter. I loved the hokey, do-it-yourself 
world of crafting.
The craft bloggers on my bookmarked 
list did not wear the crisp white button-
down like Martha Stewart. Their sites 
did not feature the polished typography 
of “Real Simple.” Their posts were often 
bogged with junky code and poorly lit 
photos. No one was trying to create a 
brand or win sponsors. There was abso-
lutely no consistency with the content 
— part of the reason why it was so fun 
to read.
 But when I entered high school, 
Instagram took an axe to the doorway 
of the blogosphere subsequently trans-
forming the world and its creators into 
valuable social capital. The authenticity 
of Mod-Podging mothers and crafty sis-
ters dissipated into the observable pres-
sure of these new platforms to maintain 
a brand aesthetic.
Soon the dusty craft blogging cor-
ner of the internet shifted from candid 
posts to much more poised articulations 
of the same projects I had attempted 
in the past. Granted, I 
probably would have 
not missed the memo 
that you have to 
use Kirby Cukes 
for pickling with 
this much more 
tactile shift of 
craft bloggers. 
But there is 
something to 
be 
said 
for 
what was lost 
due to the for-
malization of 
blogging and 
the shift to 

full blown professional influencers. 
It is often glossed over how these plat-
forms have caused more humans than 
ever before to become a brand. Prior 
to social media, branding was reserved 
for celebrities or professional athletes 
with a public presence. But now, even 
craft bloggers are expected to maintain 
a precise curation of their digital selves 
in order to survive the algorithms of the 
search engines.
This became clear as I saw the can-
didness and complexity of the craft 
blogger personality become diluted for 
the sake of easy-to-understand content 
and “reliability.” I don’t think humans 
are necessarily built to become a brand. 
The packaging of a human identity in a 
brand requires the filtration of all the 
paradoxes, complexities, and things that 
“don’t quite make sense” about a person. 
A brand has to be streamlined, succinct 
and intentional — characteristics that 
do not always align with the spontaneity 
of human character. Laundry detergent 
is supposed to have a brand, but people? 
I am not so sure.
A few days ago I logged onto “Mod 
Podge Rocks” and “A Beautiful Mess” 
and saw a completely different interface 
than the websites I remembered visiting 
every day in middle school. New logos, 
a full staff of contributors, sponsored 
content, and product lines crammed 
the masthead. The last remnants of the 
coded blogs I remembered were gone. 
Only the URL remained — the tomb-
stone of the 
hokey 
craft 
blog.

The birds of the Leslie Sci-
ence and Nature Center 
are a hidden gem of Ann 
Arbor. The predatory birds 
in the collection include 
a bald eagle, several spe-
cies of owls and vultures. 
Other animals at the exhib-
its include insects, reptiles 
and amphibians. Also on 
the grounds are nature 
trails, ponds and gardens. 
The property previously 
belonged to Dr. Eugene 
Leslie, a former professor 
at the University of Michi-
gan and his wife, Emily, 
a nature and gardening 
enthusiast. 
The 
couple 

planted gardens across 
their land over the course 
of their lives. Seeing how 
their neighbors’ children 
engaged with nature, the 
Leslies worked to create an 
educational hub to instill 
curiosity and respect for 
nature. Wanting to spread 
their love of nature to 
future 
generations, 
the 
Leslies gave the deed to 
the city of Ann Arbor in 
1976. Since then, the city 
has honored the wishes of 
the Leslies and has worked 
to maintain and expand 
the non-profit’s property.
