and Editor in Chief
Authorities are investigating a
second night of "suspicious fires"
in Ann Arbor Friday night, this
time at four off-campus loca-
tions, according to a crime alert

released Saturday morning.
Two fires were reported in
the 700 block of South Forest
Avenue, one in the 900 block of
Church Street and another in the
1000 block of Oakland Avenue.
All of the fires are said to
involve vehicles, and no struc-
tures were impacted last night,
the crime alert states.
In an interview Saturday,
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
the first firewas reportedat about
1:45 a.m. Brown said all four fires
occurred within the span of one
hour, with the last taking place at

Men's gymnastics coach Kurt Golder accepts the NCAA Championship trophy on behalf of the team at the NCAA Championships on Friday.

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
WEST POINT, New York -
After four hours of competition
and six rotations of events, the
No. 3 Michigan men's gymnas-
tics team was leading the NCAA
Championship finals by .3 points
over Stanford.
And the Wolverines wouldn't
need much more than that on
Friday night, as the men's gym-
nastics team took home the pro-
gram's fourth national title and
Michigan's first team varsity
national championship since
2005. In the process, the team
avenged last year's 1.3-point
championship loss to Stanford.
Leading the way for Michi-
gan was junior Chris Cameron.

He was selected as the Big Ten
Gymnast of the Year two weeks
ago and won the all-around com-
petition at Big Tens. So winning
this year's NCAA all-around
victory came as no surprise to
spectators in Christl Arena.
Cameron posted a total score
of 90.5, which was good enough
to upend the defending champ
from Oklahoma - Steve Legen-
dre - by 1.55 points. Senior Mel
Santander placed third in the
all-around with a score 88.90.
"I usually grasp everything
I've done right away," Cameron
said. "Not this. This hasn't hit
me yet."
Michigan coach Kurt Golder
said afterward that he thought
the experience of coming up
just short last season helped the

Wolverines.
"Finishing second last year
gave us alot of incentive," Gold-
er said. "They had a team meet-
ing last year after the NCAA
Championships, and they made
a commitment to do everything
in their power to win it. It's just
great for all of us that it worked
out."
In the team's losses this year,
the pommel horse and the fifth
rotation were weak spots for
Michigan. These routines were
plagued with mistakes and
falls. With a score of 58.85 on
the pommel horse and a meet-
high 59.50 on the rings during
the fifth rotation, victory was
almost assured for the Wolver-
ines.
Placing first on Thursday

allowed Michigan to choose
its starting event on Friday.
Knowing they would end on the
highest-scoring event - vault
- allowed the Wolverines to
remain confident, despite trail-
ing Stanford the entire meet.
Going into the last event, Michi-
gan was down by 3.05 points.
After scoring a 62.70 on vault,
they looked sure to win.
But it wasn't over. Due to a
broken ring, anybody who fell on

OBITUARY
Distinguised Ross
School Prof. C.K.
Prahalad dies at 68


* Prahalad known for
his groundbreaking
theories on
management
By SUZANNE JACOBS
' Daily StaffReporter
C.K. Prahalad, a Paul and
Ruth McCracken Distinguished
University Professor of Strategy
in the Ross School of Business,
passed away in San Diego, Cali-
fornia Friday.
In an e-mail to the Ross com-
munity, Dean
Bob Dolan
said Prahalad
died "after a
brief illness."
Prahalad,
68, was
internation-
ally recog- PRAHALAD
nized for his
research in
corporate strategy and the best
ways top management can navi-
gate the often-complex waters of
running large, multinational cor-
porations. At the University, Pra-

halad was a well-respected and
deeply admired member of the
community, both as an expert in
his field and as a teacher.
Dolan said in an interview
Saturday that Prahalad was a
"quintessential" professor who
pushed students and taught them
to appreciate the resources avail-
able to them at the University.
"He was really terrific with
the students in terms of setting
an enormously high standard for
them to follow," Dolan said. "He
really did have a way of trans-
forming their lives. He really was
a very special guy."
Dolan said with Prahalad's
passing the University not only
lost someone with an incredible
personality, but also a man with
a unique understanding of the
impact of business.
"The very special thing about
him was that he really had a very
inspiring view of what business
can do for the world," Dolan said.
Dolan added that students
who had the opportunity to work
with Prahalad were truly fortu-
nate.

Group formerly
known as
Michigamua lists
Class of 2011
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
Order of Angell released the
list of its new class of members
on Friday, which includes stu-
dent leaders from a variety of
campus organizations ranging
from varsity athletic teams to
student government.
Named after its founder and
former University President
James Burrill Angell, the group
was established in 1902. The
group, which accepts no more
than 25 student leaders from
various campus organizations
each year, is an exclusive senior
society that aims to better the
University community, accord-

ing to its leaders.
The organization changed its
name in 2007 from Michigamua
in an effort to distance itself
from a controversial past.
LSA junior James Stinson,
spokesman for this year's new
class of Order of Angell wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
group strives to improve the
campus community by bringing
leaders from different organiza-
tions together.
Alumni of the group include
prominent University gradu-
ates like United States President
Gerald R. Ford, five University
presidents and former Michigan
football players Mike Hart and
Jake Long.
"The true purpose of our organi-
zation (is)to create an environment
of proven senior student leaders to
better Michigan through humble
service and cross-campus syn-
ergy," wrote Stinson, an executive
board member of the cultural stu-

INIVAL IN CRISLER

Michigan State University police
have identified an infamous panty-
thief on MSU's campus, according
to an April 14 article in The State
News.
The suspect, a 19-year-old male
student, was caught in the act while
attemptingto steal underwear from
an MSU residence hall laundry
room on April 7, according to the
article.
A witness said he saw the suspect
placing women's thong underwear
into his laundry basket, according
to the article. Upon investigation,
the suspect was reportedly found
with 79 pairs of women's thong
underwear valued at more than
$200.
"I think (the theft) is really
weird, because you don't know
what that person is capable of or
what they're thinking," Advertis-
ing junior Sunni Schoenberg told
The State News.

LSU PROFESSOR DISMISSED
FOR TOUGH GRADING POLICY
A biology professor at Louisiana
State University was removed by
school officials for being too hard on
students, accordingto an April 15 arti-
cle published on insidehighered.com.
The professor, who teaches an
entry-level biology course, does not
use curves for her tests and, among
other methods, gives students 10
possible answers on multiple choice
questions, as opposed to the expect-
ed four, accordingto the article.
According to a statement released
by Kevin Carmen, dean of the Col-
lege of Basic Sciences at LSU, more
than 90 percent of students in the
class were either failing the class or
had dropped it by the midterm.
"The extreme nature of the grad-
ing raised a concern," Carmen said
in the statement, which was pub-
lished in the article. "We felt it was

important to take some action to
ensure that our students receive a
rigorous but fair education."
TEXAS STUDENT SETS
MULTITASKING RECORD
A student at the University of
Texas at Austin has set a new multi-
taskingrecord, accordingto an April
12 article in The Daily Texan.
Lauren Moore, a liberal arts hon-
ors and philosophy freshman, was
able to recite successfully the first
100 digits of pi, while simultaneously
balancing 15 books on her head and
solving a Rubik's cube, according to
the article.
Moore can balance 21 books on her
head without doing the other tricks
and can also solve a Rubik's cube in
40 seconds, according to the article.

PRAHALAD
From Page 1A
done (with his class)," Dolan said.
"You were going to have higher
aspirations and more confidence
in yourself."
Prahalad was born in the Tamil
Nadu province in southern India.
His father was a well-known
scholar and judge in Chennai,
India. Prahalad earned a Bach-
elor of Science degree in physics
at Loyola College and the Uni-
versity of Madras and received
a postgraduate degree in busi-
ness administration at the Indian
Institute of Management. While

in school, Prahalad worked as a
manager of a Union Carbide Co.
battery plant.
During his time at the Indian
Institute of Management, Pra-
halad met his wife Gayatri, and the
couple later had two children.
In 1975 Prahalad graduated
from the Harvard Business School
with a Doctor of Business Manage-
ment and wrote his doctoral thesis
on multinational management.
According to Business Week,
Prahalad's thesis was one of the
first studies to claim corporations
needed to restructure so that they
could employ global strategies
while addressing local concerns.
After graduating from Har-

vard, Prahalad went back to India
to teach at the Indian Institute of
Management for two years before
joining the faculty at the Business
School here at the University of
Michigan in 1977.
In 1990, Prahalad and colleague
Gary Hamel published "The Core
Competence of Corporate Strat-
egy" in The Harvard Business
Review, which explained the idea
of "core competency," - a concept
businesses now identify as a cru-
cial factor in how they and their
employees work.
Among Prahalad's many pub-
lications, he had several interna-
tional bestselling books, including
"Competing for the Future," "The

Future of Competition" and "The
Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyra-
mid: Eradicating Poverty through
Profits."
Dolan spoke highly of "Fortune
at the Bottom" and said the book
has had a profound impact in the
business world.
"('Fortune at the Bottom') ... is
one of the most influential man-
agement books ever written," he
said.
The book offered new models
for providing goods and services
to people in third world countries.
In the book, Prahalad claimed
people at the "bottom of the pyra-
mid," who were often dismissed
as outsiders of the international

economy, were actually the future
of the global market.
"If we stop thinking of the poor
as victims or as a burden and start
recognizing them as resilient and
creative entrepreneurs and value-
conscious consumers, a whole new
world of opportunity will open
up," he wrote.
According to Dolan, Prahalad
wanted to involve students in his
research for "Fortune at the Bot-
tom," so he conducted 10 field-
based projects through which
students could "document phe-
nomena throughout the world."
A 2006 article in Business Week
said the book "turned Prahalad
into a celebrity in the field of inter-

national development."
Throughout his career, Pra-
halad received a number of honors
and awards. In 2009, he received
the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman -
an award given by the president
of India to men and women who
make exceptional and praisewor-
thy contributions in their respec-
tive fields. In the same year, the
Indian government honored Pra-
halad with the Padma Bushan
the third highest civilian award
in India - for his distinguished
service to the nation. The Times
of the United Kindom also named
Prahalad the most influential busi-
ness thinker on its The Thinkers
50 List in October 2009.

Officials say U.S.
withdrawal from
Iraq is on track
The planned withdrawal of
nearly 45,000 U.S. troops from Iraq
by the end of August is on track in
spite of a recent increase in attacks
by militant forces, the top U.S. mili-
tary commander in Iraq said yes-
terday.
Army Gen. Ray Odierno said
that al-Qaida's strength in Iraq is
steadily degrading. Unless there's
a dramatic and unforeseen change
in the security situation, the U.S.
troop drawdown will go ahead as
scheduled, he said.
There are now about 95,000
U.S. troops in Iraq, according to
Odierno. The U.S. plans to cut that
number to 50,000 by Aug.31, when
it will end combat operations.
"I fully expect us to be at 50,000
by the first of September," Odierno
said on "Fox News Sunday."
As part of an agreement with
Iraq, the U.S. will withdraw all
forces by the end of 2011.

Flood of aid reaches
China's remote

Badly needed aid finally is
arriving in a remote western
China town shattered by an earth-
quake, including enough food and
shelter for tens of thousands of
suddenly homeless, though some
complained it wasn't reaching
everyone in need.
The surge in aid coincided with
the arrival yesterday of Chinese
President Hu Jintao, who cut short
an official trip to South America
to deal with the disaster in this
remote Tibetan region where resi-
dents have frequently chafed under
Chinese rule. The quake Wednes-
day killed 1,706 people and injured
12,128.
The president's carefully script-
ed trip included visits with dis-
placed families living in tents and
rescue teams as they dug through
debris looking for the 256 still miss-
ing. He promised that the Commu-
nist Party and the government was

doing everything they could. Tibet-
an anger over political and religious
restrictions and perceived econom-
ic exploitation by the majority Han
Chinese have sometimes erupted in
violence.
China Central Television
showed Hu sitting with a Tibetan
middle school student at a field
hospital and comforting her as she
wept. Her right arm was bandaged
and supported by a sling.
"Rest assured, you will have a
full recovery," he told the girl. "You
will have a bright future. Grandpa
will be thinking of you."

Tearful pope says

With tears in his eyes, Pope
Benedict XVI made his most per-

children and bring abusive priests
to justice, the Vatican said.
The emotional moment carried
no new admissions from the Vati-
can, which has strongly rejected
accusations that efforts to cover up
for abusive priests were directed by
the church hierarchy for decades.
But the pontiff told the men that
the church would "implement
effective measures" to protect
children, the Vatican said, without
offering details.

Retired art teacher Adrienne Rudolph discusses the history behind a replica of a painting by Georges Seurat created by patients at C.S. Mott Children's Hospit
years ago. Several patients who contributed to the painting reunited yesterday for the anniversary of the completion of the work.
ARTISTIC HEALING
Hospital patients reunite, celebrate 15-year
anniversary of bed sheet painting's creation

By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
In a hallway of the C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, past the col-
orful lobby with a large Big Bird
statue and the patient check-
in, hangs an eight-foot-wide
bed sheet showcasing a replica
of pointillist painter Georges
Seurat's "A Sunday on La Grande
Jatte."
Yesterday - 15 years after the
replica was finished - patients
who created the piece, their
families and hospital employees
gathered around the painting for
a small reunion as they reflected
on their experience creating the
work.
Though the painting took
Seurat two year to complete, the
135 hospital patients who par-
ticipated in the project took three
months to complete their imita-
tion, which has been hanging in
the hospital ever since.
Adrienne Rudolph, Ann Arbor
native and a retired art teacher,
orchestrated the pointillist rec-
reation after years of struggling
to bring artistic expression to
the children being treated at
Mott.
According to Rudolph, bring-
ing art to the hospital was a
struggle because many patients
lacked the energy after heavy
treatments to take part in activi-
ties like painting, sculpting and
making collages.
"Many of them were too sick,"
Rudolph said. "They were tak-
ing medications that made them
too sleepy, or a technician would
whisk them away for a test before
we could begin."
Rudolph began painting on the
casts of patients as well as face
painting their bodies, which she
said was sometimes easier than
trying to coordinate an art proj-
ect. In the 14 years she worked
at the hospital, Rudolph said she
painted every image imaginable,
including cowboys, animals and
superheroes.
Rudolph said she even painted
on the heads of children with leu-
kemia in the cancer ward.

According to Stinson, the mem-
bers ofthis year's classuwere chosen
based on leadership and achieve-
ment in their respective campus
activities.
"We value diversity, and we
value individuals who have earned
the greatest respect from their
peers," Stinson wrote.
In the recent past, each class of
order of Angell was referred to as
a "pride," but on the list released to
the Daily this year the term was not
used.
Stinson wrote that while the
organization no longer considers
itself "secret," members prefer to
do work without recognition.
The group decided to change its
name in 2006 in response to claims
that the name insensitively referred
to a fictional Native American tribe,
officially becomingOrder of Angell
in 2007. The group was also histori-
cally known for engaginginvarious

Native American rituals.
In 1989, the group agreed to
stop all Native American rituals
in its ceremonies, due to criticism
from people not affiliated with the
group who were offended by their

knew they were going to lose
their hair, they asked to have it
shaved right away because they
were so anxious to get their heads
painted," she said.
Despite her success with using
art to lift spirits, Rudolph contin-
ued to search for a way to encour-
age children in the hospital to
express themselves artistically.
She said she found a solution dur-
ing a visit to the Art Institute of
Chicago, where she was blown
away by Seurat's masterpiece,
"A Sunday on La Grande Jate."
To create the picture of people
sitting and strolling in a park,
Seurat developed pointillism - a
technique that involves forming a
picture with dots of paint.
"I thought, 'This is it. Eureka!
I've found it.' Because I knew any-
one could paint dots," Rudolph
said of seeing the painting.
Rudolph immediately contact-
ed the institute for permission to
replicate the painting and used a
recycled, old hospital bed sheet in
place of a heavy canvas.
By splitting the painting into a
grid, Rudolph was able to trans-
form the 10-foot work onto the
eight-foot sheet. Patients could
choose which square they want-
ed to paint, which allowed them
to work individually on a small
portion of the painting in their
rooms.
Because it was easy to trans-
port, the recycled bed sheet trav-
eled through burn units, bone
marrow transfer units and sev-
eral other hospital areas with
patients who had injuries that
prevented them from participat-
ing in other art projects.
Rudolph said even if patients
only had a fewminutes, they were
able to contribute a few dots.
During her presentation yester-
day, she pointed out sections of
the painting where different art-
ists worked.
"The young person who did
this figure had to have extensive
surgery," Rudolph said while ges-
turing to a woman strolling in the
painting. "She painted until the
minute the gurney came to get
her."
Because of the pointillist style,
practices.
In 2000, members of Students
of Color Coalition allegedly found
Native American artifacts in Mich-
igamua's meeting space in the
Michigan Union tower. The Coali-
tion subsequently alleged that the
group was in violation of the 1989
agreement.
After the Students of Color
Coalition occupied the office for 37
days, Michigamua chose to move
out of the office in the Union per-
manently. Accordingto past Michi-
gan Daily articles, it has never been
confirmed why the Native Ameri-
can artifacts were in the office.
Also in 2000, the group began
tapping women for membership for
the first time.
Stinson wrote that Order of
Angell will work this year to
rebuild trust with all communities
- particularly those hurt by the
group's past actions.
"We do not consider any cur-
rent disagreements or hostility as
permanent or immutable," Stinson
wrote. "History cannot be undone,
but we, as progressive, conscien-
tious leaders can change the future
and act with sensitivity and pride

for all members of the Michigan
community."
- Because of his membership
in the group, Editor in Chief Jacob
Smilovitz did not edit this article.

patients with every kind of injury
could partake in the project. The
border of the painting was done
by sick toddlers as young as 22
months old, and Rudolph said
two paralyzed accident victims
painted their dots "painstaken-
ly" with special brushes in their
mouths.
Rudolph said a young blind
patient was able to paint the sun
in the painting, as his mother
guided his hand. She said that
though he had never seen the sun,
he said he had felt its warmth,
and she explained to him that
there are warm colors that corre-
spond to the sun.
"All of the time he was paint-
ing he was thinking about what
yellow could look like," she said.
"And I really think that he got
it, because he not only used his
yellows, but he mixed in some
oranges and did an absolutely
beautiful job."
Though it has been 15 years
since they painted their portion
of the painting, several patients
returned to the hospital to reflect
on their experience at Mott.
For many of them, the painting
is an important relic of the dif-
ficulties they faced during their
hospital stays.
Joe Pollack, a patient who par-
ticipated, said he is doing much
better today than he was when he
painted his dots.
"I worked on this painting 15
years ago when I was waiting on
a heart transplant," he said. "My
heart is now as old as this paint-
ing."
LSA junior Erin McElhenie
said she was only four years old
when she contributed to the bed
sheet, and Sunday was her first
time returning to the hospital
since her treatment.
"I had cancer when I painted,"
she said. "Now I'm 15 years can-
cer-free. Most of my time here
is kind of blurry, but being here
today helps me to remember."
After the presentation,
Rudolph explained that because
hospitalized children have rigid
existences and are unable to
make any of their own decisions,
giving the patients a chance to do

art is important because it allows
them to make choices.
"Art is very empowering," she
said. "It's a wonderful method of
self-expression and sick children
really relate to it.
Rudolph, who spoke during
the presentation with tears in her
eyes, said she feels a strong con-
nection to the patients. She keeps
in touch with some of them and
recently attended the wedding
of a girl she worked with many
years ago.
Rudolphalsosaid shehadnoth-
ing to do with the accomplish-
ment of the piece itself. Though
she said she never painted a sin-
gle dot, some of the ex-patients
were inspired by her work and
the work of hospital staff.
Rudolph said after the "last dot
was dotted," she wanted to do
something significant with the
painting. In honor of Mott's 25th
anniversary, the patients and
their families decided to donate
the work to the hospital.
The piece, which is now framed
and hung, holds a special mean-
ing to the patients who come to
the hospital, Rudolph said.
"It is a monument to all of the
children who dame to this hospi-
tal, and all the children who ever
will come here," she said.
Melissa Barghs is a mother of
one of the patients who contrib-
uted to the painting with a few
dots atthe lower left corner of the
scene. Her daughter was an infant
when she painted, but Barghs
said the hospital did everything
to keep her happy.
"It was a great distraction from
what was happening in our lives
at the time," she said.
Now, years after the paint-
ing was finished, her daughter
is attending college, and Barghs
said little things like this remind
her that she is very fortunate.
"We never thought it would be
finished all the way," she said. "I
think it turned outbeautifully."

their dismount on the rings was
given a second chance to compete.
Oklahoma was a full three points
behind Michigan at this point, so
the likelihood of them catching up
was slim to none, even with two
competitors left. And as it turned
out, junior Thomas Kelley was
able to compete again, increasing
Michigan's score, and sealing the
deal for the national champion-
ship.
The top eight scorers in each
event Friday were crowned All-
Americans and went on to com-
pete for individual event titles on
Saturday. Redshirt senior Kent
Caldwell was named All-Ameri-
can on the floor exercise and vault
and redshirt senior Ryan McCar-
thy won the only event title for
Michigan on high bar.
"I had to focus on making sure
that I was aggressive on my high
bar set," McCarthy said. "Every-
thing came into place after that.
I caught my release move, did a
good dismount, and a clean land-
ing."
Following McCarthy on the
high bar, junior Ian Makowske
placed second and Santander tied
for third. Santander and junior
Thomas Kelley placed second and
fifth on the parallel bars. Cam-
eron and McCarthy were also
All-American on the parallel bars,
tying for seventh.
Though the season is over, some
Wolverines are not done yet. Gold-
er and freshman Rohan Sebastian
left immediately after that meet to
travel to England for the European
championships as coach and par-
ticipant of the Irish national team.
Cameron will be traveling to Aus-
tralia for the Pacific Rim Champi-
onships for the U.S. national team.
As the Wolverines hoisted the
national championship trophy at
the conclusion of the meet, they
began to chant: "It's great to be a
Michigan Wolverine." The voic-
es resonated all through Christl
Arena as everybody watched.
"With ourtlast national champi-
onship that we won, when we got
back on Monday it was the best
day of work in my life," Golder
said. "So unfortunately, I'm going
to miss that this year."

Reform the vote
MSA must fix problems with its online elections
F ourteen percent should never sound impressive when
it comes to voter turnout. But when figures for the last
Michigan Student Assembly election were released, 14
percent seemed pretty good - because it was the highest turn-
out the elections had seen in years. Yet, recent disclosure that
Rackham Rep. Hamdan Yousuf voted for himself more than once
in the elections has called into question MSA elections, its rules
and the quality of the online voting system it employs. To val-
idate the democratic system, MSA must fix the flaws with the
online voting system and take action to prove to students that
voting matters. And students must remember that they have a
civic duty to vote.

Risky business

In the MSA elections held in March, You-
suf received 28 weighted votes all of which
were cast by him. He was able to vote for
himself more than once because the online
voting system counted different spellings
of Yousuf's name in write-in boxes as sepa-
rate votes. According to an Apr. 15 Daily
report, Michael Benson, outgoing chair
of MSA's Rules and Elections Committee,
considers this flaw in the system "undem-
ocratic" and believes that issues with the
voting system being made public would be
problematic for the Assembly.
Yousuf seems to have voted for himself
more than once in an effort to draw atten-
tion to the inconsistencies in the MSA vot-
ing system and election rules. But good
intentions don't justify unethical behavior.
And even though Yousuf's election was
uncontested - meaning no other candi-
date was harmed by his actions - casting
multiple votes for oneself is an affront to
the validity of a democratic election.
There are other ways Yousuf could have
gone about addressing what he called in
a phone interview with the Daily "gray
areas" in the All-Campus Constitution's
rules on elections. He could have con-
tacted Benson before the election with his
concerns, worked with other representa-
tives to encourage updates to the system or
made the problem public - without com-
mitting an act that would amount to fraud
in any other election.
Though Yousuf's methods weren't the best
way to show concern about MSA's election
rules, he has revealed a flaw in the election
system. MSA election rules are somewhat
ambiguous and confusing, but it's clear that
no one should be able to vote for the same
candidate more than once - that's simply
undemocratic. And now that MSA is aware
of the defect, it has a responsibility to fix the
problem. MSA should implement a system
in which each ballot is reviewed to ensure

it doesn't contain multiple votes for a single
candidate. But to protect voters' privacy,
ballots should remain anonymous during
the review process. This would increase the
amount of time required to count votes, but
time is a small price to pay to ensure that
elections are fair.
But ultimately, the biggest problem is stu-
dents' lack of interest in MSA. Yousuf ran
uncontested in the election. And according
to Benson, graduate students usually only
cast 500 votes during elections. Graduate
turnout is especially low, but student turn-
out to vote for elections is always uninspir-
ing. This year's 14-percent overall turnout
was an increase from last year's 9-percent.
MSA clearly doesn't have the student body's
support. Graduate students, who make up 40
percent of the student population on campus,
believe they aren't given enough representa-
tion in the Assembly, according to the Daily
report. Most students' perception of MSA is
overwhelmed by scandal after scandal and
few tangible results. MSA must show suc-
cessful results that impact students' every-
day life to spark the interest of the student
body and increase voter turnout.
But interest is a two-way street. Stu-
dents should take responsibility if they
want MSA to change. Students don't have
the rightto criticize MSA if they don't vote.
They must take the time to elect capable
leaders that will work to better students'
lives. Students must increase their interest
in MSA if they want to see a change in the
way MSA operates.
Yousuf's actions, though unethical, have
exposed a flaw in MSA's voting system that
needs to be addressed. MSA must work
toward increasing student participation by
showing students that it is relevant. But for
their part, students should stand by their
responsibility to vote in order to hold their
student government accountable for its
actions.

n the spring of 2000, I was pre-
paring to study abroad in Coch-
abamba, Bolivia when a local
dispute of water
service got out over
control. Residents
and campesinos
staged a general
strike and barri-
caded the streets.
Since the city
serves as a key node
in Bolivia's trans-
port network, the PATRICK
country shut down.
Clashes between O'MAHEN
police and protest-
ers turned violent
and several dozen people were killed,
leading to a declaration of martial law.
Rather concerned, I contacted the
head of my language school, and he
replied that he'd be happy to refund
my deposit, but added that these
things weren't too out of the ordinary
and that it would still be safe for me
to come.
I did not tell my mother.
That was how I ended up studying
Spanish in a city under martial law
that summer. The dispute died down
and nothing happened to me or any
other of my classmates. I had a fan-
tastic time, met fascinating people
from all over the world and learned
more Spanish than I ever have before
or since.
I keep that experience in mind as I
think about the University's current
ban on travel to northern Mexico.
I do understand the University's
caution. Violence has spiked in the
region, and a few incidents seem to
have specifically targeted U.S. govern-
ment employees, which is disturbing.
Certainly the number of homicides
in Ciudad Juarez reaching 2,600 last
year - a rate of200 perl100,000 inhab-
itants, roughly 20 times the rate in
Detroit - is a cause for caution, as are

shoot-outs in broad daylight between
police and well-armed drug gangs.
The desire to keep students safe, as
well as potential liability concerns,
favor a travel ban. Getting caught in
a gun-battle with automatic weapons
probably isn't the educational experi-
ence the University has in mind.
But I also want to interject a note
of caution before any sober analysis of
the situation turns to hysteria. Some-
thing that struck me about the Apr. 12
U.S. State Department travel warning
to northern Mexico was how much of
it consisted of rather mundane state-
ments - drive on main roads, travel
in groups and don't engage in ostenta-
tious displays of wealth.
My personal favorite is an invoca-
tion to patronize only "legal" busi-
nesses. It's good advice, sure, but
avoiding prostitutes and not buying or
selling drugs seems like a no-brainer.
"Don't go looking for trouble and
trouble probably won't find you" is a
good rule to follow in any foreign or
U.S. city. Several of my friends and
colleagues who have recently trav-
eled extensively in border cities, like
Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Piedras
Negras and Tijuana, say that rule will
keep you as safe now as it always has.
Beyond using common sense, it's
important to keep risks in perspective.
We take risks every day in the United
States that we tend not to think about
because they're an intrinsic part of the
environment. Before I went to Bolivia
in 2000, I read the United Kingdom's
foreign ministry's travel information
section on the U.S. The section noted
America's high levels of violent crime
and elevated rates of auto accidents
as problems to avoid. A section on
the dangers of Florida in particular
caught my attention. After reading
that, I felt reassured about undertak-
ing my Bolivian adventure.
Today as well, our British cousins
and their commonwealth brethren

in Australia and New Zealand note
the risk of potential terrorist attacks
in the U.S., as well as the widespread
incidence of severe weather, like tor-
nadoes, hurricanes and blizzards.
Throw in the high risk of earthquakes,
tsunamis and volcanic activity on the
West coast and in Alaska, and sudden-
ly America sounds like a pretty risky
trip. In fact, New Zealand's foreign
ministry lumps us in with Mexico as
the two destinations in North Amer-
ica that involve some risk of travel. I
guess Canada, Cuba and Costa Rica
are safer. And that's not even con-
sidering a specific warning about the
rabid raccoons in New York City's
Central Park, from the U.K.'s foreign
ministry (seriously).
Studying abroad
is worth potentially
facing some danger.
Suddenly my University of Roch-
ester-sponsored 1998 studies in Oax-
aca, Mexico (a state with an active
communist insurgency, high levels of
marijuana production, a thoroughly
corrupt local police force and quite
a few earthquakes) doesn't sound all
that risky.
All of this isn't to make light of a
serious situation. Northern Mexico
has some significant problems right
now and any traveler should exercise
extreme caution. Certainly, better safe
than sorry, but let's keep the situation
in perspective - considering many of
the risks we blithely face every day
without realizing it.

Out-of-classroom experience

BRENDAN FRIEDMAN AND JULIA FRIEDMAN
Support Greek housing

This week, over 100 college students from
across the country will venture to the Capi-
tol Building in Washington, D.C. to lobby on
behalf of the 2009 Collegiate Housing and
Infrastructure Act. Their goal is simple. Each
student will meet with his or her representa-
tive to advocate for the passage of the bill. The
creation of the act is part of a campaign to drive
down the overall cost of college and is critical
to the longevity and sustainability of safe and
affordable non-university owned housing on
college campuses across the country.
The 2009 Collegiate Housing and Infra-
structure Act proposes to alter the federal
tax structure to include a tax deduction for
people who make monetary contributions to
non-university and non-profit housing, such as
fraternities and sororities. The current federal
tax structure discourages people from donat-
ing to non-profit, non-university owned houses
by not granting them tax deductions for their
donations. Currently, an individual will only
receive a tax deduction for a donation to a non-
profit housing structure if the house is univer-
sity-owned.
Changing the law will undeniably lead to
more charitable contributions to non-uni-
versity affiliated housing on campus. These
houses can use tax-deductible contributions to
renovate their facilities by updating fire safety
devices or replacing old pipes, thus driving
down the cost of living in such housing.
Here at the University, over 4,000 students
live in non-University owned and not-for-
profit housing each year. Many students who
reside in these facilities don't consider alumni
contributions when trying to cope with the
increasing cost of housing on campus. They
simply force themselves to take out more loans.
However, loans shouldn't be the only answer.
Many of the 460,000 living University alumni
lived in non-University affiliated housing and
might possibly take advantage of the opportu-

nity to make a donation for the betterment of
that facility if granted tax deductions for their
contributions.
University alumni of fraternities or sorori-
ties won't receive the tax benefits for donating
to their non-profit chapter house, but would
receive these benefits for donating to Univer-
sity housing. Where is the logic in that?
Chi Phi Fraternity President Matthew Eral
faces the same struggle. Eral stated, "My chap-
ter's housing corporation is already non-profit
and there is no reason that our alumni should
not be able to donate tax-free to a social, aca-
demic, and philanthropic studentorganization."
In many cities, there are new regulations
and safety codes that deem current houses
unfit. Rent and security deposits across col-
legiate campuses are increasing for students
who live in non-University owned housing.
And current students will shoulder the entire
burden of keeping their house up to date.
It is necessary for the continued success of
non-affiliated housing that the students and
faculty at this University get behind the bill.
Since so many undergraduate students live in
non-profit, non-University owned housing,
passage of the bill will have a great effect on
the cost of living in these facilities.
On Tuesday, MSA unanimously voted to sup-
port the passage of the bill in Congress. This
monumental decision should set a precedent
for the rest of campus. Regardless of your affili-
ation, lowering the cost of higher education is
something every student at this University can
relate to. Thus, we urge you to join us in our
fight. Please contact your representative and ask
them to supportthe 2009 Collegiate Housing and
Infrastructure Act. We must make our voices
heard in order to keep college affordable.

MSA's Greek Relations Committee and

As my first year at the Univer-
sity comes to a close, I want-
ed to share some of the most
interesting things
my parents paid
$50,000 for me to
learn. Here are the
top 15 "outside the
classroom" lessons
that I've learned
during my first
year at the Univer-
sity:
1. Working for ALEX
The Michigan
Daily is an excel- SCHIFF
lent way to pro-
crastinate on your
homework while being able to con-
vince yourself you're being produc-
tive. Unfortunately, this doesn't hold
true for playing "Madden 2010."
2. Drinking only on days that end
in "-day" is not the best compromise
between work and fun.
3. If you can muster yourself out
of bed around 10 am. the day after
Halloween, it's worth it. It's the only
day of the year you'll see President
Barack Obama perform the walk of
shame through the Diag.
4. The new smoking ban on cam-
pus has caused quite a controversy,
but I think we're failing to realize
the real rising danger:lskateboarders.
They are infinitely more annoying
than the occasional smell of smoke,
and I shouldn't have to dodge rolling
12-year olds to get to class.
5. Since college started, I haven't
been able to study in a normal study-
ing area like my room, a library, a
lounge, etc. When I need to study,
I go to a pub on South University
called the Blue Leprechaun, my most
productive spot on campus. But after
about 10 p.m., the drunken custom-
ers become fascinated with the idea
of someone studying in a bar and feel
compelled to engage with you in con-
versation, limiting productivity.

6. Dorm life is interesting. In
the span of 20 minutes one Thurs-
day night, I played a game of putt-
putt in my hallway, was given a free
vegetarian pizza (that turned out
to have sausage on it) and tied my
neighbors doors together by linking
closet "space savers" that had previ-
ously served no other purpose than
to make my closet look like a war
zone. Their new function was a vast
improvement.
7. Soup cans are a perfectly legiti-
mate way of supporting a broken
futon.
8. Those - like your mom - who
tell you you're insane for supporting
your broken futon with soup cans
clearly don't understand the awe-
some strength of Healthy Choice
Chicken with Rice.
9. The most essential dorm room
product isn't ramen noodles - it's
duct tape. Sure, ramen noodles offera
cheap snack. But ramen noodles can't
manufacture a strategically placed
cup holder against my bedpost.
10. It's absolutely impossible to get
anywhere off-campus by bus. And I
prefer not touse taxis, as the last time
I used one the driver told me he left
his last job with another cab company
because he "was in an accident and
they wouldn't let me drive the nice
cars anymore."
11. No Thai! is more effective at
healing illness than any other medi-
cine I've taken. If the University were
really serious about stopping the flu,
they would just give people gift cer-
tificates to No Thai!
12. We're going to school to be
lawyers, engineers, doctors, etc.,
yet judging by the computer screens
during my Econ 101 discussion class
last semester, the consensus favorite
activity of University students is pre-
tending to be a farmer. Once, some-
one asked me to borrow my MacBook
charger so that they could continue
playing Farmville until class was

over. It was on that day that I lost
faith in humanity.
13. The phrase "So while I was
Facebook-stalking you in class yes-
terday..." has gone from warranting
a restraining order to an entirely
acceptable way to start a conversa-
tion.

Things I've learned
outside of a lecture
hall this year.

14. There was nothing more
euphoric than watching Tate Forcier
literally be carried over the goal line
like a crowd-surfer in the comeback
against Indiana. There was also
nothing more depressing than watch-
ing Tate Forcier fumblethe ball in the
end zone against Ohio State ... besides
his four subsequent interceptions.
15. Everyone is nuts about foot-
ball here, but hockey games at Yost
are the most fun sporting events I've
been to at the University. Plus they
had the added benefit of beating more
than one Big Ten opponent this year.
When I enrolled at the University,
I expected to study economics, learn
another language and have a good
time with friends new and old. At
the end of my first year, I'm writing
this column in a bar and I'm staring
into a summer during which Iwill be
leading The Michigan Daily's opin-
ion page. It's been a year of new and
interesting experiences, as any fresh-
man year at college should be. But
above all - I'm just glad I don't go to
Ohio State.

Flint and Dearborn campuses. Taylor
said one of the committee's main jobs
is to seek feedback on the smoking
ban from University students.
"The whole notion is that our
approach should have great trans-
parency; it should have a lot of stu-
dent involvement," Taylor said.
Taylor said committee members
range from "being militant non-
smokers to militant smokers," as
well as people who are ambivalent
about the issue.
"We were quite intentional
about having a group of folks that
ran the gamut because we felt that
that brings the greatest voice to the
table," Taylor said. "And if you can
surface what the issues are, you are
most likely to make decisions that
are based on full input of the com-
munity at large, and you know what
the controversies are and you can
address them."
Malinda Matney, senior research
associate in the Division of Student
Affairs, is in charge of gathering
student input on the University's
decision to move toward a smoke-
free campus.
Last October, Matney compiled
a survey that was sent to 5,000 ran-
domly selected University students.
The University's three smoke-free
committees - focused on student
input; health and wellness; and
education - planned to use survey
results for determining how to help
smokers on campus and make the
smoking ban effective.
According to Matney, 1,332 stu-
dents responded to the survey - a
number she said is "pretty miracu-
lous."
* The survey evaluated students
on their smoking behaviors. Results
showed that about 23 percent of
people surveyed reported partaking
in smoking behaviors.
Matney said this data, as well as
information from the University's
first-year student survey, University
Health Service surveys and Coun-
seling and Psychological Services
surveys, show that relatively few
University students smoke.
Though the majority of students
don't smoke, the Smoke-Free sur-
vey sought to evaluate how the ban
would impactstudents. When asked
"to what extent will a non-smoking
campus affect you?", 27.4 percent
responded "not at all," while 21.4
percent responded "a great deal"
The rest indicated that they would
be "slightly," "moderately" or "con-
siderably" impacted.
In addition, the survey asked
students to report their ethnicity,
gender, origin and involvement in
student organizations on campus,
among other characteristics.
Despite differences among
respondents, Matney said a com-
mon theme students articulated
in the survey was their concern
for fairness for all students, facul-
ty and staff regarding the Smoke-
Free University Initiative. She
added that many expressed mixed
views of the University's decision.
"The students aren't of one
voice within this," Matney said.
"Some students are very stri-

dently against the initiative, and
some students are very stridently
in favor of it and saying'Let's do it
tomorrow. Now. Let's do it now."'
In March, a similar survey was
sent to a new sample of 5,000
students to compare results with
those of the first survey and for the
smoke-free committees to use for
making policy recommendations.
Matney said she is currently
sorting through the data. Though
she did not have any specific
information, she said there was a
10-percent response rate.
When asked why 5,000 stu-
dents were sampled in the sur-
veys, Matney said it was a number
large enough to get a "powerful"
response. She added that the Uni-
versity doesn't want to "burn out"
students by sending a ton of sur-
veys because they don't want stu-
dents to stop responding.
While these surveys questioned
students about the Smoke-Free
University Initiative, a separate
committeeisinchargeofsurveying
theUniversityfacultyand staff.
One of the main differences
between results of surveys sent
to students and those sent to fac-
ulty and staff was the fear of gain-
ing weight as a result of quitting
smoking. Matney said it came as
a surprise that faculty and staff
were concerned about this effect,
but students were not.
"One of the big concerns that
people have is issues around
weight. If I stop smoking I will
gain weight. It was just assumed
that our students would have that
same concern," Matney said.
However, students reported
that they smoked for reasons other
than weight loss or gain. Accoxd-

ing to survey results, the most com-
mon listed reason that students
smoke is to alleviatesstress, followed
by smoking as a means of relaxation
and an activity to do while drinking.
The majority of students responded
that they smoke while at parities.
CAPS Director Todd Sevig, co-
chair of the health and wellness
division of the Student Life Sub-
committee, has been working with
several focus groups of University
students - who indicated in the
Smoke-Free surveys that they would
be willing to participate - to gather
students' advice for ideas on how to
improve health services for students
who may need resources when the
ban is in place.
Sevig said feedback from the
focus groups matched the outcome
of the survey, which found that stu-
dents smoke when feelingstressed.
As a result of information gath-
ered from these discussions, Sevig
said UHS is going to try to create
new stress management programs
for students as well as "repackage"
existing CAPS and UHS services to
cater further to students' needs.
Sevig's committee has also looked
at what other smoke-free universities
across the country have done to help
students quit smoking.In its research,
Sevig said the committee discovered
that traditional quitting methods
like smoking cessation products and
weekly support sessions are not nec-
essarily effective for students.
"The thing is gum, patches, sup-
portgroups, they may work once we
get out in the work world - older
adults so to speak - but for some
students that's not a good fit," Sevig
said. "That's not going to work. We
need to think of different things,
creative things."
As of now, Sevig said he does not
know if CAPS or UHS will offer
smoking cessation products for free
or for purchase, but he said the com-
mittee will do further research dur-
ing the spring and summer terms to
determine how best to helpstudents
who want to quit smoking.
Taylor said one of the main goals
of offering new programs through
CAPS and UHS isnto assist students
in "self-conscious decision making."
"We're not presuming to make
decisions for people," Taylor said.
"What we'd like to do is create the
avenues for them to make informed
choices about their own behaviors
because, ultimately, smoking is a
very personal choice."
According to Taylor, the edu-
cational measures committee is
examining ways to enforce the
smoke-free policy. Taylor explained
that the committee is recommend-
ing educational approaches instead
of disciplinary actions, adding that
the ban will serve as an opportunity
to teach students how to engage in
"peaceful conflict resolution."
"It's not at all about law and
order," Taylor said. "Itcreally is about
education and development and try-
ing to really capture that moment
and use it as a way for students to a
lot of times engage with one another
in holding themselves accountable."
Taylor added that Department of
Public Safety officers will not issue
citations to students smoking in the

Diag. However, she said there might
be consequences for repeat offenders.
LSA senior Michael Rorro, for-
mer Michigan Student Assembly
vice president, was one of the stu-
dents who sat on the Student Life
Subcommittee and gave input on
how to enforce smoking penalties.
Rorro, who is a smoker himself,
said committee members agreed
that there should be no severe sanc-
tions within the first two years of
the initiative. Instead, the Univer-
sity should focus on educating stu-
dents about the initiative so that
there are "no surprises," he said.
"We wanted to make sure people
know what was going on rather than
slapping fines on people," Rorro
said. "We didn't want to see people
getting tickets right off the bat."
To promote education of the
smoking ban, Rorro said the com-
mittee made recommendations for
the University to set up information
tables throughout campus as well as
send online and print materials to
incoming freshmen informing them
of the initiative.
While forming recommendations,
the committee reviewed policies at
other smoke-free Big Ten schools.
According to Rorro, committee
members liked Purdue University's
"campus concern form," in which
anyone on campus could anony-
mously fill outa form and share con-
cerns about smoking issues.
LSA senior Chris Chiles, a mem-
ber on the Student Life Subcommit-
tee who founded the University's
chapterof Studentsfor SensibleDrug
Policy, said he thinks building man-
agers will ultimately be in charge of
addressingthese concerns.
"It would not be right to burden
DPS with anything like this," Chiles
said, adding that he thinks the poli-
cy is "pretty unenforceable."
In committee discussions, Chiles
said he advocated for the University
to keep cigarette containers on cam-
pus - saying that removing them
would result in unnecessary litter of
cigarette butts.
Though Chiles said he doesn't
agree with the idea of a campus-
wide smoking ban because it
infringes on students' rights, he said
he understands the University's
mindset in wanting to promote a
healthier campus.
"My personal view is that (stu-
dents) should still have the right (to
smoke) because they're not harming
anyone else," he said. " However, I
think the University is trying to
create a culture of health and well-
ness, which is an idea I support!'
While much work still needs to
be done to figure out the logistics
of implementing the ban and pro-
viding students, faculty and staff
appropriate health resources,
Sevig said he thinks the Smoke-
Free University Initiative will
benefit the campus community's
knowledge of smoking.
"I think there's actually a lot
of misinformation about smok-
ing, smoking behaviors (and) the
effects and consequences, so I
think one really cool outcome
will be reducing some of the
myth and misinformation around
it," he said.

Ann Arbor firefighters investigate car fires early Saturday morning. Ann Arbor Police Sgt. Matthew Lige said or
morning that upon preliminary investigation, no injuries had been reported.

From Page 1A
roughly 2:45 a.m.
Brown emphasized that while
DPS is not directly involved in the
ongoing investigations, officials
are concerned about the proximity
of the fires to the University com-
munity.
"These (fires) are happening in
areas which are heavily populated by
students, and we want to ensure stu-
dents are aware of that," Brown said.
As of Sunday evening, Ann
Arbor Police Department officials
said they would not comment on
the incident, but said they are cur-
rently working with the Ann Arbor
Fire Department in the investiga-
tion.
In interviews Saturday after-
noon, students who live in the area
said they witnessed commotion
and smelled smoke around the time
of the fires.
LSA senior Alicja Sobilo, who
lives in an apartment complex on
the 700 block of South Forest Ave-
nue, said she went into the lobby
of her apartment building at about
1:45 a.m., soon after the fire there
began.
Sobilo said a large group of
women from Alpha Delta Pi soror-
ity house located across the street
at 722 South Forest Ave. had con-
gregated in the apartment com-
plex's lobby, adding that the lobby
was packed.

"There were girls with blan-
kets," Sobilo said. "Some of them
seemed really worried."
Sobilo said several of the women
in the lobby told her a truck was
on fire in their parking lot. Sobilo
added that though she smelled
smoke, at no point did she see actu-
al flames.
When contacted Saturday, Busi-
ness School sophomore Ashley
Anderson, Alpha Delta Pi's presi-
dent, declined to comment on the
night's fires.
Another member of Alpha Delta
Pi answered the door of the soror-
ity house today but also refused to
provide comment.
LSA senior Harrison Taylor,
who lives on South Forest's 700
block, also said he smelled smoke
but did not see fire.
"I saw an ambulance, fire trucks,
a bunch of cops and I could smell
smoke, but I didn't see any fire,"
Taylor said.
Another fire occurred in an alley
behind The Abbey, according to
another tenant of the apartment
complex.
Jessica Miller, a student at Ann
Arbor's Washtenaw Community
College who shares an apartment
in the complex with several Uni-
versity students, said she was in
her apartment at the time of the
fire and witnessed the commo-
tion.
"People said they had been
walking and then they saw bright
lights and realized it was fire,"

Miller said.
In a similar incident two weeks
ago, a blaze charred three cars
beneath The Abbey complex. That
fire caused smoke damage to some
of the units near the flaming cars,
according to an April 3 article in
The Michigan Daily.
Miller expressed concern and
fear about the two separate inci-
dents occuring so close to one
another.
"It's really disconcerting, it's
really scary," she said.
The Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment is offering up to a $5,000
reward for information on the
fires. As of 9 a.m. Saturday morn-
ing, authorities said there were
no suspects. If anyone has any
information about the "suspicious
behavior around parked cars,"
they're being asked to contact
police immediately.
Saturday's string of fires come
exactly two weeks after a similar
series of fires in Ann Arbor. Though
all of the April 3 fires reportedly
started outside of buildings, the
blazes did reach at least one build-
ing and caused structural damage.
That fire gutted a rental house at
928 S. State street, killing 22-year-
old Eastern Michigan University
student Renden LeMasters and
injuring two others.
According to an April 7 report
in the Daily, Ann Arbor's police
and fire departments are split over
whether or not the fires on April 3
can be classified as arson.

Taking a final bath

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles": corrupting our nation's youth since 1984.
'Kick-Ass' c C ass

Awkward action comedy
can't find its identity,
secret or otherwise
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
"How come nobody's ever tried to be a
superhero?" The answer is never fully pro-
vided in "Kick-Ass," but

when the end rolls around
we don't particularly care,
either. Heralded by crit-
ics as the perfect cross
between gritty realism
and fantasy, "Kick-Ass"
manages to be both and
neither at the same time.
The film opens like a

Kick-Ass
At Quality16
and Showcase
Lionsgate

of awkwardness surpasses the likes of
Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg as his
voice cracks and falters in his numerous
voiceovers. He and his friends try hard to
keep the banter going, and sometimes it
works, but once the cast of over-the-top
characters enters the picture, all becomes
lost in the land of dialogue. Henceforth,
the film proceeds to devolve into some
kind of unwieldy mash-up of "Watchmen"
and "Kill Bill."
The biggest problem with "Kick-Ass" is
its inconsistency. It's understandable that
a film modeling itself after a comic book
world should be unrealistic, but the char-
acters are so one-dimensional and hammy,
they border the line of ridiculousness.
Moretz (who was quite possibly the
worst thing about "(500) Days of Summer")
grates as she attempts to mix her tough-
girl attitude with snaggletoothed charm.
Unquestionably, she gets the best lines -
"Contact the mayor's office, he has a special
signal he shines in the sky; it's in the shape
of a giant cock" - but the ways she executes
them are just so uncomfortable you want to
cover your ears. Child actors are given a lot
of flak for just standing there and looking
cute, but Moretz confirms all that can go
wrong when they get to do more.
And as for the mustachioed Cage, the
man loses any shred of good will left over
from his neurotic turn in "Bad Lieuten-
ant" last year, playing his insufferably
caricatured Big Daddy to the T of weird
tics and scenery chewing. Truly, the only
thing more cheesy than Cage is the array
of bizarre Italian mobsters following him,

each equipped with a fake Brooklyn accent
and swagger to match. The mobster king-
pin's nerdy son Chris, played by Christo-
pher Mintz-Plasse ("Superbad"), is the only
character that sticks, managing to provide
some much-needed comic relief in his lim-
ited screen time.
Of course, all becomes forgiven once the
real "ass-kicking" begins. As soon as the
mouths stop moving, "Kick-Ass" features
action scenes full of jaw-dropping kineti-
cisni that rival the best of Japanese kung fu
flicks. There's a delirious, manic bloodlust
to the film, as Moretz's character flips up a
wall and careens 360 degrees over it, show-
ering the killers in a stream of bullets and
butterfly knives. Blood with the consistency
of nail polish streams down their faces, as
they slowly collapse and Joan Jett pounds
out in the background. The girl can't act,
but damn is her body double good.
"Kick-Ass" is undoubtedly a fun movie,
with its fight scenes sparkling in a way
even non-action lovers will be able to get
on board with. But since it doesn't do real-
ism or escapism correctly, it ends up tee-
tering in a limbo zone that pleases no one
and confuses everyone. In the end, the film
becomes too facile to be any kind of com-
mentary on society's increasingly schaden-
freudian mindset, too unidimensional tobe
a typical loser bromance comedy, but too
clunky to be the sort of neorealist escap-
ism inhabited by the likes of "Sin City" and
"Watchmen." It's a film that could have
had so much more to deliver had the story-
line been less ambitious, less awkward and
less full of Nicolas Cage.

T his is my final music column.
And, for this reason, thinking
about writing it has filled me
with a stomach-churning mixture of
exasperation, latent
self-righteousness
and straight-up writ-
er's block. Needless.
to say, this feeling
has not been over-
whelmingly pleasant.
There's just some-
thing so petty about JOSHUA
a final column; like, BAYER
this is my "last grand
musical statement"
- my last chance to inform Ann Arbor,
for the umpteenth time, about how
much better FM radio was in the '90s.
(Seriously, if "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
or "Loser" were to crack the Billboard
Top 20 in this day and age, I think my
disbelief might even rival Miley Cyrus's
inevitable aneurysm).
The point is that, over the course of
my year-and-a-half reign as the Daily's
music columnist, I have not been sav-
ing up. Every half-baked theoretical
notion about the politics, ontology and
evolution of music, every last mor-
sel of intellectual deliberation about
what influences the way in which we
process recorded noises - essentially
every musical thought that has passed
through my mind over the last handful
of months, I have already consolidated
and vomited out onto this page.
Of course, I could have just gone the
noble route and not even mentioned
the fact that this is my last column.
Who cares anyway, other than myself?
I could have just quietly snuck out the
back door with a cute little rant about
how much I love it when a band knows
exactly how and when to use miscel-
laneous percussion. There's something
so simple yet so stomach-tightening
when a tambourine or a shaker bursts
into the mix at just the right moment,
being shaken just the right way.
It's just that, given the fact that I've
already said everything major I could
have possibly ever wanted to say about
music, and that I don't really feel like
writing that column on miscellaneous
percussion, I feel like I'm kind of stuck
between a rock and another rock.
In a nutshell, I didn't want this last
column to be incredibly lame, but I also
didn't want it to be incredibly indul-
gent (although this column is swiftly
becoming both of these things). And,
while I definitely wanted to feel some
sort of personal attachment to it, I also
sort of felt like this was just my ego
being a bit of a dick. After all, the last
time I wrote a column about the role of
music in personal life, someone com-
mented, quite concisely: "No one cares
about your family. Stop writing."
But I'm not going to stop writ-
ing, even thoughI probably should,
since my word count is telling me I've
reached the halfway point and my con-
sciousness is telling me I have accom-
plished absolutely nothing so far. In
fact, I'm probably just going to regress
and talk about why I'm here.

I am here because I used to take
baths with my dad. I would take baths
with my dad and he would blast me glo-
rious noises on his boom box: Nirvana,
Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Def Leppard,
Led Zeppelin, Stone Temple Pilots,
Alice in Chains, The Offspring, etc.
He would take me to concerts too
- I remember having to leave Metal-
lica early because the stage was alleg-
edly supposed to "blow up" during the
encore, and my parents, both psycholo-
gists, didn't want me tobe trauma-
tized. I remember thinking the smell of
marijuana was the smell of rock music.
But, most of all, I remember thinking
music fans were terrifying: big, husky
men with intimidating moustaches
and leather Harley Davidson jackets;
men who exemplified the term "heavy
metal." And, of course, their chain-
smoking, red-lipsticked girlfriends.
But if my dad had taken me to jazz
shows instead, I would have perceived
music fans as a tender, warm-souled
group of African American head-bob-
bers. And if he'd taken me to indie rock
concerts, I would have perceived music
fans as dressing incredibly ironically
and all having eating disorders (not to
stereotype at all).
Bathing myself in
self-indulgence.
I guess my point that I've kind of
stumbled across as I've been writing
this column is that music is big. Sure,
film is divided into millions of sub-
genres as well, but when it comes down
to it, there's the people who go to regu-
lar theaters and the people who go to
"artsy" theaters. And the people who
go to the "artsy" theaters are all more
or less the same: They all love the Coen
brothers, they all pretend not to love
Quentin Tarantino and they all hate
"Twilight."
Basically, there's the people who go
to the movies to be diverted, and the
people who go to the movies because
they crave artistic expression. But,
with music, there's not such a rigid
divide. Sure, I think Panic! at the Disco
is bourgeoisie scum, but, for whatever
reason, I've been to a Panic! concert
before, and trust me: The atmosphere
there was just one giant ball of prepu-
bescent passion.
At a concert, there's no such thing as
a half-assed music fan - you went out
of your way to buy that ticket, and you
are there to lose yourself in the sound
waves. And, asI sloppily wrap up this
cow pie of a final testament, there's one
thing I need you to know: If you are
reading this column, whether you're a
Schubert aficionado or a metalhead, the
fact is that you love music. And, for that
reason, I love you. See ya later!

Dum Dum a smart choice

.'Dragon Tattoo' is a marked success

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
Lisbeth Salander is not simply a girl with
a dragon tattoo. She's a girl with many tat-
toos and many piercings
and an attitude to match. ***
She's a fascinating char-
acter, but unfortunately The Girl With
"The Girl With the Drag- the Dragon
on Tattoo" isn't solely
dedicated to watching Tattoo
Salander fight crime Atthe Michigan
while roaring around on
her motorcycle. Music Box
Salander (Noomi
Rapace, "Daisy Diamond") gets involved
with Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist,
"Downloading Nancy"), an ordinary jour-
nalist who is swept up into an extraordinary
investigation of an almost-40-year-old mur-
der of a 16-year-old girl. Salander and Blom-
kvist join forces to solve the twisted mystery
that involves uncovering a family's darkest
secrets, a series of grotesque killings, some
Nazis and some sadists.
Needless to say, "The Girl With the Drag-
on Tattoo" is a pretty dark film. For the most
part, it takes place in the bleak but beautiful
Swedish countryside that has been scarred
by the murder. The film's note of haunting

emptiness is offset by an extreme amount of
graphic violence. "The Girl With the Dragon
Tattoo" is based off the bestselling book of
the same title by Stieg Larsson, and the film
stays true to the author's original depictions
of brutality.
The majority of the violence is direct-
ed toward women - there are two rape
scenes and an endless host of female
mutilated bodies. If the film had kept its
official, international title - "Men Who
Hate Women" - then the graphic images
wouldn't be as unexpected. The violence is
incredibly shocking and gets increasingly
difficult to watch, as it's not the imper-
sonal, mainstream gunfight violence that's
found in most movies. The violent scenes
in this film are very real and disturbing,
but the movie provides no commentary on
the acts or on the problems in society that
gave rise to them.
Perhaps director Niels Arden Oplev
("Worlds Apart") chose not to focus on
delivering a message on violence against
women because he was too caught up in his
jumpy storyline. It's hard enough as it is to
keep track of the various suspects, who's
dead and who's not and how each suspect is
related to the others. In addition, Salander
and Blomkvist each have a separate, minor
storyline. But neither of their individual

stories is as intriguing as the main one.
While Oplev is able to keep the combined
narrative engrossing on the screen, the
story is not easy to follow, which makes for
a tangled tale.
The one aspect of the film that encour-
ages the audience to stay on top of the story
is Salander herself. She is an effortlessly
cool and tough heroine with impressive and
Gothic superwoman

diverse skills - from hacking computers to
having a photographic memory. Unfortu-
nately, she's so engaging that it's hard not
to wish Blomkvist would just disappear or
let her handle everything. Rapace brings
a surprising amount of depth to Salander.
While she is basically a gothic superwom-
an, she's also tortured by a disturbing past
and has difficulty reaching out to the world
around her. At times, she's as hard to figure
out as the case she's trying to crack. Luckily,
sequels are already in production, so there
will be more chances to discover exactly
what Lisbeth Salander is capable of.

girl bands have tobe willing to play the
part: the copious reverb of Brooklyn's
finest juxtaposed
with an aesthetically *
pleasing vintage per-
sona via Vivian Girls; Dum Dum
Or L.A.-vibing to-fi
garage-grunge riffs Girls
melded with a hazy I Will Be
underground perso- Sub Pop
us a is Pearl Harbor.
Whatever the gim-
mick may be, if indie girl bands plan on
making it big, it seems they better be
willing to conform to a certain precon-
ceived (or at least stereotypical) guise.
If it's any consolation, Dum Dum
Girls - the name being an homage to
The Vaselines's album, Dum-Dum, and
the Iggy Pop track "Dum Dum Boys" -
definitely fits the latter bill. Sure, they
don't fill any conspicuously neglected
void in California's burgeoning fuzz-
pop scene, but their endearingly-serrat-
ed throwback sound has still managed
to make them queens of the L.A. to-fi
culture.
Dum Dum Girls's debut album I Will
Be is 30 minutes of addicting pop haze.
Lead singer Dee Dee (who goes by her
first name only), who describes the
sound as a "blissed-out buzz saw" on
Sub Pop's website, wrote and recorded
lead vocals for each track. The album
is full of high profile collaborations
including Nick Zinner's (Yeah Yeah
Yeahs) brilliantly brooding guitar riffs
on "Yours Alone" as well as Crocodiles's
Brandon Welchez's velvety vocals and
guitar on duet "Blank Girl."
Although Dee Dee first formed Dum
Dum Girls as a solo project - she pro-
duced an impressive self-titled EP and
a slew of shoegazy singles - she quick-

ly decided to form a legitimate band
and recruited three of her friends to
turn her idle-rock hobby into a fervent
career.
Both opener "It Only Takes One
Night" and "Jail LA LA" wax the band's
take onbadass femininity. Behindfuzzy
synths and a gritty bass line, Dee Dee's
vocals become submerged in pounding
reverb on the former. While "Jail LA
LA" is an '80s-vibing nostalgic treat
where the girls cause a not-so-dainty
ruckus - they get thrown in jail, grab
their motorcycles and go on joy rides
behind the coy chorus "Someone tell
my baby / Or else he won't know I need
saving" - Dee Dee plays up her rebel-
lious, cigarette-smoking demeanor.
Like she'd ever really need saving.
But it's not all aboutfilthy guitar riffs.
Concluding track "Baby Don't Go" feels
like the quintessential indie romance,
complete with hints of yearning and
Rocking the indie
girl identity.
soul spilling. Embedded within a slow
acoustic backdrop, Dee Dee confesses,
"I never had a mother / I hardly knew
my dad / I've been in town for18 years /
You're the only boy I've had." Although
corrupted by a sense of desperation,
she whispers her lines with a seductive
voice that yields an undeniable allure.
With I Will Be, Dum Dum Girls
aren't necessarily revolutionizing the
to-fi retro scene. Their sound is similar
to L.A. lo-fi standards Nite Jewel, Best
Coast and plenty of other gals - but
that's OK. Lovey balled "Rest of Our
Lives" succinctly sums up their mis-
sion. "Oh baby let me take you for a ride
for the rest of our lives": These girls are
in it for the long haul.

After a runner-up
finish last season, the
Michigan men's
gymnastics team won
its sixth national
title, while junior
Chris Cameron
took home the
all-around title.



Despite slumping start,
Santander finds his role


m

By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
WEST POINT, New York - Competing
to his potential never was his forte. But in
his last competition for the Michigan men's
gymnastics team and on the biggest stage,
senior Mel Anton Santander laid four years
of hard work in the gym out on the floor.
He finished with a
score of 88.900 Friday at NOTEBOOK
the team NCAA Cham-
pionships, good for third
in the all-around competition, his first-
ever All-America honors. His high scores
qualified him for the parallel and the high
bars in the individual championships on
Saturday where Santander placed second
on the parallel bars with 15.050 points and
tied for third on the high bars with a score
of 14.475.
Santander spent most of his freshman,
sophomore and junior years in a slump.
Notorious for sitting quietly at meets, mull-
ing over his routine in his head and letting
the pressure build up inside him, it wasn't
until the end of his junior season that he

began to excel in competition.
"It's just been a journey for me,"
Santander said. "To come all the way from
the beginning and I just feel like I peaked
at the right time, and it's just awesome. To
finally be an All-American is just absolute-
ly amazing. I'm pretty speechless."
Before the end of his junior season,
Michigan coach Kurt Golder sat down
with the whole team to discuss staying
loose when competing. It took Santander
a few meets to take Golder's advice toj
heart, but when he hit every routine at last
season's NCAA team finals-in which the
Wolverine's finished second-it was clear
he had set the pressure aside and just had
fun.
"People would say that he under-
achieved for his first three years," junior
.and fellow All-American Chris Cameron
said. "At this point in the year, he's been
10 times what many teams hope out of one
of their gymnasts. He's just been a rock.
And seeing Mel do that, it feels so great to
watch my teammate realize his potential
like Mel did this year."

Daily Sports Writer
WEST POINT, New York -
Fifth-year seniors Ryan
McCarthy, Kent Caldwell and
Phillip Goldberg made that extra
year well worth it Friday when
they won the national champion-
ship.
After a successful season last
year, all three chose to return
for one last shot at a title. Having
finished as the NCAA runner-up
last year, they easily could have
walked away satisfied with that.
"It wasn't all in vain," Gold-
berg said. "I remember last year
at NCAA, Ryan and me started
talking and we were like 'dude
we got to come back'. I kind of
already had the mindset that I
was, but with that NCAA run-

ner-up finish, I knew we had a
chance to win it all. So, I came
back with that mission to do what-
ever I could to help the team."
In the trio's first year on the
squad as freshmen in 2006, the
Wolverines failed to make the
top six at NCAA for the first time
in nine years and the first time
in Michigan coach Kurt Golder's
tenure at Michigan.
Prior to Golder's arrival in 1997,
they failed to make the NCAA
Tournament for 12 years in a row.
"When us fifth years came in,
we had a lot of hardships," Gold-
berg said. "We were one of the
laughingstocks of all the NCAA
teams. And to come from the bot-
tom all the way to the top, and
take it to the promise land, feels
real good."

FOOTBALL
Converted safety Cam
Gordon makes debut

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
While most of the 35,000 sets
of eyes huddled in the cold at Sat-
urday's Michigan football spring
game were focused on the quarter-
backs, one player
was making his NOTEBOOK
debut at a posi-
tion that was far more troubling for
the Wolverines last year.
Saturday's spring game meant
the much-anticipated public debut
of redshirt freshman Cameron
Gordon at safety, where he was
moved from wide receiver this
spring.
For weeks, the reports out of
practice had indicated it was a
smooth transition. At one point
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said it was one of the better person-
nel moves the staff had made.
Before the game, Gordon was
recognized as the team's breakout
player of the spring. And during
the game, he seemed comfortable
at the safety spot - not spectacu-
lar, but he didn't seem to blow any

coverages.
"I feel like I transitioned over to
a new position in a good way," Gor-
don said. "Playing offense last year,
that's where I wanted to stay at, but
I felt like I had to help the team."
Gordon played on both sides
of the ball his entire high school
career. He didn't practice as a safe-
ty last year, but the position isn't
entirely unfamiliar to him.
Gordon's continued progress
should be a huge help for a Michi-
gan team that had its share of trou-
bles at the safety position last year.
"I did good in the spring ball,
could have been better," Gordon
said. "Still, got things to learn,
hopefully when camp come along
with more practices I can keep on
moving forward."

Bodnar, Michigan's ticketing

Robinson
By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
A year ago, as the Michigan
football team took the field for its
annual spring game, high school
senior Denard Robinson stood on
the sidelines at the Big House.
Donning his bright red and yel-
low Deerfield Beach High School
letterman jacket, the dual-threat
quarterback looked on as early
enrollee quarterback Tate Forci-
er impressed Michigan fans and
coaches to the tune of three touch-
downs through the air.
But in this year's edition, Robin-
son didn't spend much time on the
sidelines.
The sophomore, who contribut-
ed mostly with his legs last season,
threw three touchdowns and ran
for one Saturday while working
with the first-team offense, stand-
ing out in comparison to the other
two quarterbacks in contention to
start - Forcier and early enrollee
Devin Gardner.
"He's developed a whole new
aspect of his game as far as mak-
ing great reads and making great
throws," senior defensive line-
man Ryan Van Bergen said. "His
throws are on lasers now, he's not
throwing balls up for grabs. He's

shows off
putting it right on receivers. ...
He's dangerous and he's probably
made the most progression (this
spring)."
"He's always had the ability to
throw it," Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez added.
Backed up to his own three-yard
line, Robinson stood comfortably
in the pocket and delivered a rope
straight into the hands of sopho-
more wideout Roy Roundtree
who had been streaking on a post
route over the middle of the field.
Roundtree took the catch the dis-
tance, completing the scrimmage's
most electrifying play- 97 yards
long - and solidifying Robinson's
impressive performance.
After the game, Roundtree
insisted that Robinson's improved
passing ability has become obvi-
ous over the course of the spring,
as he has focused more on adding
touch to his throws.
Without that necessary touch
last season, Robinson threw four
interceptions to just two touch-
downs.
"His arm is way better than it
was freshman year," Roundtree
said. "He's not throwing it as hard
like he was, jamming people's fin-
gers."

When I was in middle school,
my grandpa - the man who
introduced me, at a very young
age, to Michigan football, and
was consequently my hero - had
a stroke. The articulate, well-
read and always interesting man
was never quite the same after
that, but he'd
have moments
where his eyes
would light up "The D

lounging around,
watching TV, when he sprang up
and hurried down to his bedroom
to grab something.
"I want you to have this," he
said, holding out his hand to
reveal his class ring from the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
When I got into the school, my
grandma cried. It almost felt like
fate - to follow in his footsteps.
But that's where I diverged from
the path he set for me.
Mom, dad, grandmas, grandpa:
Thanks for helping me out so
much the last few years; there's
no way I could ever repay you for
what you've given me. ButI have a
confession to make:
In the last four years, I've
worked upwards of 60 to 80 hours
a week putting out a newspaper
for college students. As you can
probably imagine, that doesn't
leave the time one would like
to be able to allot for studying.
I've stayed up until four in the
morning sometimes, desperately
playing Tetris with InDesign and
newsprint to put outa paper that
inevitably ended up soaking wet
on the floor of the UGLi bath-
room.
I've driven the equivalent of
the earth's circumference in
University-owned mini vans,
rocketing through Pennsylvania
in the middle of the night to make
it back in time to host the weekly
story meetings.
I've screamed at some of my
best friends I've made in col-
lege, and broken friendships over

seemingly petty happenstances
(well, for those who never worked
at the paper). And I can't tell you
how many times I've questioned
whether all this bullshit was real-
ly worth the terrible things I had
to put my body and mind through,
just so bored students had a Sudo-
ku puzzle in Biology 118.
I'm not exaggerating, and I
thought it was probably time to let
you in on this little secret of mine.
ButI promise, I wouldn't have
made such a sacrifice if I didn't
look back at my work at the Daily
as one of the best things I have
ever done - and probably will
ever do.
The friends I've made, I'll have
forever. The people I love, I'll
never forget.
And the people who have been
affected by the words I've writ-
ten for the Daily (both positively,
like the teacher who called to
tell me she used my story to give
her inner-city students hope,
and negatively, like the Maize
Ragers who deemed me the Bum
of the Game, twice, and focused
their unwieldy
heckling talents
at me), are all the
lally will proof I need that
sports writing is
e with my passion, and I
hope to do it for a
rery step long time.n
It's h ard not
y lfe, to be corny in
a column like
this. So I'll just
come out and say
it: Courtney, Mike, Scott (and
Brody), Nicole, Ruth, Clif, Gare-
bear, Peej, Felds, Jason, Meisner,
Jake, Chanel and everyone else
I've worked with - I fucking love
you. You probably don't all feel
the same, especially now that
your life doesn't involve "Chair
Monkey" anymore, butI fucking
love you.
Pyzik, Alex and all the other
eager sports youngsters - don't
you dare quit, even though I
promise there will be times you'll
want to.
And the reason I say that will
become painfully clear when
you're all standing in a circle with
your fellow seniors after the last
nightside, taking straight pulls of
Johnny Walker and crying and
reminiscing.
I still can't retrace all the steps
that led from my grandpa's ring
to The Michigan Daily managing
sports editor. It doesn't seem to
flow, but I know it does.
All I know is this: just short
of tattooing an English-style 'D'
on my buttcheek, the Daily will
always be with me, and it will
affect every step of my life, both
professionally and personally.
And I don't care if you enjoy the
Daily or you wipe your ass with
it. Thanks for picking it up day-in
and day-out.

the Wol-
verines came up to bat.
Michigan (9-0 Big Ten, 33-5
overall) racked up 26 hits and as
many runs over two games to send
the Wildcats on their way in a
series sweep.
Saturday's 11-7 win over
unranked Northwestern marked
the first time the Wolverines gave
up more than two runs in confer-
ence play this season. Starting the
first night game at Alumni Field
this season, junior Jordan Taylor
pitched a rollercoaster of a game
for Michigan.
Taylor was called for an illegal
pitch on the first pitch of the ball-
game - the umpires said her back
foot came off the mound - and
struggled most of the evening, giv-
ing up three earned runs and walk-
ing six. But Taylor was aggressive
when she needed to be and man-
aged to pitch herself out of jams -
striking out14 Wildcat batters.
"I thought (Taylor) hung in
there and her offense picked her
up tonight," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "That's what their
job is. In all, I thought ourteam did
a very nice job of hanging on and
playing for the win. We kept com-
ing back.
"Even when we gave up runs,
we turned around and came back.
That's what good teams do. You
don't always have your 'A' game. I

didn't think Jordan had hers, but
she persevered through the game."
While Taylor didn't have her
best stuff on the mound Saturday,
the rest of the Wolverines stepped
up defensivelyto pick their pitcher.
Senior catcher Roya St. Clair threw
out three Wildcat base runners to
stifle Northwestern (4-5, 18-18) on
the base paths.
"The scouting report on (North-
western) is they like to steal," St.
Clair said. "We were expecting
that. We just got good tags by our
shortstop and second baseman,
and there were some good throws
there. It was nice to help (Taylor)
out and get some outs for the team."
All nine Wolverine starters got
at least one hit on Saturday, though
the Michigan bats were quieted
in the middle of the game. Junior
Dorian Shaw went 2-for-3 in game
one, with a rocket home run to
center field in the bottom of the
sixth inning while senior captain
Maggie Viefhaus continued to
swing a hot bat in conference play,
going 2-for-3 with 2 RBI in the
night game.
"You can go through our order,"
Hutchins said. "We've always got
someone to look forward to. (Vief-
haus) is a great leader out there
from both sides of the ball. (Shaw)
continues to impress me with her
one-pitch focus."
The offensive parade- car-
ried over to Sunday, as Michigan
mercy-ruled the Wildcats 15-0.
Three home runs - a grand slam
from senior starting pitcher Nikki
Nemitz, a two-run shot by senior
Angela Findlay and a solo blast by
Viefhaus - helped the Wolverines
score in every inning en route to
the win.
Nemitz's shot to right center
field was her second grand slam of
the season and third of her career.
The slam was part of a five-run

Senior Maggie Viefhaus hit a solo home run against Northwestern on Sunday in
Michigan's 15-0 win.

first inning that helped the Wol-
verines get on the board early and
they never turned back.
"I was feeling good so I was
excited to hit," Nemitz said. "I
actually got down in the count and
I was just like 'just base hit, I just
need a base hit.' I actually swung
at a really bad pitch but it felt good
off the bat and I just watched it as
it kept going. I got excited and got
lucky that I actually hit a decent
part of it."
The senior also carried her offen-
sive successes overto the mound, as
she struck out eight Wildcat batters
and walked just one.
"(Nemitz is) such a great play-
er," Viefhaus said. "All around,
she's a great pitcher, she's a great
defender, she can make any play. At

the same time she's a great hitter.
It (was) fun to see that grand slam
go over the fence and just watch
her perform as she can."
Michigan hosts Penn State in
a doubleheader on Wednesday to
close out its three-series homes-
tand. Atop the Big Ten and defend-
ing a current 27-game home win
streak, the Wolverines are playing
their best ball of the season.
"It's tough for the pitcher to
face our lineup," Hutchins said.
"They can't pitch around us. I'm
really pleased with my kids bring-
ing their game and making them
throw it in the middle of the plate.
We've done a nice job of laying
off bad pitches and that is a great
quality. It makes you very tough to
pitch to."

And the lineup is only one part

While it's tough to compare
this year's pitching duo - junior
Jordan Taylor and senior Nikki
Nemitz - to the hurler that set all-
time Michigan records in nearly
every major pitching category,
they're still performing among the
best of the NCAA.
Through the first 51 innings of
conference play, they've given up
just 11 runs and tallied 74 strike-
outs.
The mere fact that there are two
of them could be advantageous in
the long-term. Ritter took on the
bulk of the work in the 2005 run,
getting the start in 15 of the 16
postseason contests. This season,
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
distributes the work more evenly,
as both Taylor and Nemitz have
tossed more than 100 innings
through the first 37 regular season
games.
"What's great about it is, num-
ber one, it promotes a sense of
competition between the two, so
you have the ability to want to step
it up a little bit more," Ritter said.

"But at the same time, you know
that if you're having an off day,
there's someone there to pick you
up. And all pitchers have off days."
But there's still only one fac-
tor that could decide whether this
team can go the distance - moti-
vation.
When a team as balanced as
Michigan is in a weak conference
like the Big Ten, it can uninten-
tionally lull itself to sleep as it
sweeps inferior teams in a lengthy
season.
Just like the fans, the players
wish they could speed ahead to
face the field in Oklahoma City.
"They have every single chance
to win it," Ritter said. "But some-
body's got to push them. Some-
body's got to give them a tough
game. Try their patience. Test
them out. Give them a chance to
understand what it takes to get to
that World Series."
Time will tell if there is any
team that can challenge the 2010
squad before the postseason starts
on May 21.
Until then, the team, the fans
and Ritter will just have to wait
patiently.

Blue keeps tie for Big Ten
lead, wins in rubber match

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer
A 17-1 victory in the opening
game of a series would seem to

"(Burgoon) gave us a valiant

early, and to his credit, he was
just marvelous. He came in with

CALAMITY ON THE RINGS: A
20-plus foot ladder isn't normally
part of the scene on the floor at the
Christl Arena. But Friday night,
the ladder was a staple for much of
the meet. After the rings broke as
an Illinois gymnast was doing his
routine, officials had to bring in a
whole new set of rings.
It took 40 minutes to secure
them and after almost every rota-
tion, the rings were tweaked
again.
"We were like alright, just con-
trol what you can," Chan said.
"So we stayed loose and when we
came back we just came on again.
Everyone just picked it up and we
rocked the sets."
The team is accustomed to
practicing on the rings at the
Coliseum in Ann Arbor and com-
peting on different ones at Cliff
Keen Arena. Those rings are noto-
riously crooked at times so the
issues just made the competition
feel more like a home match, even
SENIORS
From Page 1B
Since freshman year, the three
have been the building blocks
behind the rebirth of the gymnas-
tics program. After Michigan's sev-
enth-place finish during the trio's
freshman year, it went on to place
fourth in 2007, sixth in 2008, and

second in 2009.
"It's all about that saying 'Those
who stay will be champions,' "
McCarthy said, referring to the
famous sign put up in the Michigan
football team's locker room in 1969
by first-year head coach Bo Schem-
bechler. "And I'm living it in the
moment and that's incredible. It's
what the team's all about. It's just
an incredible feeling to be a cham-
pion."
The three contributed high
scores this past weekend. McCar-
thy was the only individual event
winner on the high bar, Caldwell
was an All-American on the floor
and vault, and Goldberg had the
second-highest score on a crucial
ring routine Friday during the team
finals.

the punting drills.
He dropped two of them, but the
fact that the balls were even going
near him doesn't bode well for the
Wolverines' punting unit next year.
"We didn't have too many that
landed in the white lines," Rodri-
guez said. "Which is concerning."
In fact, sophomore quarterback
Tate Forcier looked like the team's
best punter on Saturday, at one
point booting the ball 53 yards.

Berset knocked the winning run
home with a single to right field
with no outs, scoring junior out-
fielder Ryan LaMarre.
It was an outburst akin to the
events of Friday night, when the
Fighting Illini (4-5, 16-15) help-
lessly looked on as the Wolver-
ines came into Illinois Field and
laid a beating on them in the
series' opening game.
Michigan got on the board
early, putting up two runs in the
top of the first. And by the time
the next inning was over, the
team was up 9-0, and the rout
was on. Maloney stresses the
importance of "big," "shutdown"
innings all the time, and his team
answered the bell Friday and
Sunday.
The offense wasn't even nec-
essary in the opener, as the Wol-
verines' ace, senior right-hander
Alan Oaks, shut down the Illini to
the tune of just five hits and one
run over eight innings.
It was a welcome sign, as the
big righty had struggled recently.
Oaks began the season on a tear,
accumulating a 2.63 ERA over his
first five starts, including solid
performances against ranked
teams North Carolina, Louisville
and Coastal Carolina.
But Big Ten play had been his
bane during the first two weeks,
as he was subpar against Indiana
and Purdue.
That changed in Champaign,
though.
"We needed to get him back
on track," Maloney said. "We're
going to have to pitch really well,
especially on (Friday), through
the rest of the season if we're
going to have some success. It's
good to see Alan get going, and
hopefully he'll build momentum
and get back to where he was."
The other bright spot was the
long-awaited first home run, of
the season for senior Mike Dufek,
who led all Big Ten first basemen
with 17 a year ago.
While the rest of his offensive
game remained strong, earlier
this season Dufek nonetheless

had to watch painfully as less
powerful teammates like fresh-
man centerfielder Patrick Biondi
and redshirt junior second base-
man Anthony Toth went deep.
The co-captain finally got on
the board with his blast in the
third inning Friday, part of a
4-for-5, four RBI day. And though
his teammates mockingly greeted
him with silence back in the dug-
out, it was a satisfying moment.
"It's a huge relief," Dufek said.
"Right when I hit it, I knew it was
out, with the wind blowing out
like it was. Really, (Maloney) just
wants us to knock in runs, the
guys in the middle of the line-up.
But it was nice to have it."
The team's goal every week-
end is to win the series, and three
weeks into Big Ten play, Michi-
gan is 3-for-3, good enough for a
first-place tie in the conference
with Ohio State.
While a home stand against
the Buckeyes looms in two weeks,
Michigan first hosts Iowa next
weekend.
"We're in the hunt," Malo-
ney said. "We're where we need
to be right now. When you're in
first place at this point and in the
thick of things, that's huge.
"I definitely like the way the
team's shaping itself out right
now."
KRANTZ UPDATE: Redshirt
freshman outfielder/infielder
Kevin Krantz, who fractured
his thumb in the March 26 game
against Indiana University-Purdue
University Fort Wayne, is likely out
for the rest of the season.
Krantz had been one of a
number of players attempting to
replace LaMarre in the lineup
when he was out with his own
broken thumb, though now with
senior Mike Kittle's emergence
and LaMarre's return, Krantz was
unlikely to see much playing time
had he not gotten injured.
Maloney said he will be re-
evaluated in about three and a half
weeks, but as of now, it does not
look good for the Traverse City
native's return.

ROBINSON
From Page 1B
The talk surrounding Robinson's
spring maturation had been getting
louder and louder as spring prac-
tices went on, and with Robinson's
performance Saturday in front of
35,000 fans, the talk of him chal-
lenging incumbent starter Forcier's
job is now at its loudest.
But Rodriguez insists that the
competition remains too close to
call, with all three quarterbacks
making strides in the spring's 15
practices.
"I'm pleased that they've gotten
better (but) nobody has taken the
position and grabbed it," Rodri-
guez said. "I was hoping more than
one guy would anyway... I don't
know if it will be solved, who's the
No. 1 guy, by the first game."
Forcier - who had injured his
ankle in practice on Thursday -
looked much less impressive than

he did in his first spring game,
nearly throwing an interception
on his second play of the afternoon
while also losing a fumble.
After leading Michigan to a 4-0
start last season, Forcier's produc-
tion dropped off significantly in
the second half of the season, as
the Wolverines stumbled to a 5-7
finish.
Despite the well-publicized bat-
tle between Robinson and Forcier,
the day's biggest ovation came
when an entirely different signal
caller took the field.
Gardner, whose hype had pre-
ceded him as the nation's top dual-
threat quarterback, struggled at
first in his debut in the Big House,
fumbling his first snap and throw-
ing an interception. But his poten-
tial was obvious as the game went
on, as he launched a perfectly
thrown deep ball to junior slot
receiver Martavious Odoms late in
the scrimmage, which Odoms let
fall between his hands.

"Tate and Denard are a little bit
ahead of Devin," Rodriguez said.
"They have a little more experi-
ence."
Despite the fact that Robinson's
performance took place ina spring
scrimmage, his obvious improve-
ment in the passing game could
open the door to him being named
the winner of Michigan's quarter-
back battle.
As he stood on the sidelines last
spring, even then, Robinson knew
being in the starting lineup could
be in the cards for him.
"I've got a pretty good chance,"
Robinson told the Daily after
last year's spring game about his
opportunity for playing time last
fall. "That's my gut feeling, but the
coaches are telling me I've got a
chance to start."
And that chance could be draw-
ing near in his second season, as
spring practices end and the sum-
mer competition heats up under
center.

Srocyzinski and Navas end career
with doubles loss, singles victories

By ANDREW HADDAD
Daily Sports Writer
Senior Day for the Michigan
men's tennis team almost turned
into a disaster for George Navas and
Mike Sroczynski.
After an emotional ceremony
before the Wolverines' eventual
5-2 victory over Purdue, the two
seniors lost a heartbreaker at No. 1
doubles, 9-8 (3), surrendering the
doubles point to a mediocre confer-
ence foe they were heavily favored
to beat.
"We came out a bit flat in doubles
and weren't really on top of our
game," Sroczynski said. "We kept it
close there for a while, but couldn't
get that one bounce we needed to
overcome."
Things got worse when Sroczyn-
ski dropped the first set of his No.
3 singles match, and Navas's oppo-
nent at No. 4 singles took him to a
second-set tiebreaker. For a while, it
appeared that Navas's match would
come down to a third set.
"I'll admit it, I was pretty ner-
vous," Navas said. "I tried not to
think about it, but the idea that I
would lose on Senior Day to Purdue
was hard not to think about."
Fortunately for the two seniors
and the Wolverines (7-1 Big Ten,
11-8 overall), Sroczynski came back
and won his match 2-6, 6-4, 6-3,
and Navas took care of business in
the tiebreaker to win 6-3, 7-6 (5).
"I'm a little disappointed in our
performance, especially in dou-
bles," Michigan coach Bruce Ber-
que said. "We came out a little flat
in an area that is usually our strong
point. We'll need better efforts than

Senior George Navas helped the Wolverines to a 5-2 victory on Senior Night.

this from now on. But I'm proud of
the way we bounced back, especial-
ly George and Mike."
Victory came a little more easily
for the other Wolverines. At No. 1
singles, freshman Evan King put on
a dominant performance, winning
6-1, 6-0. Junior Jason Jung won
6-2, 6-3 at No. 2 singles and junior
Chris Madden won 6-0, 6-3 at No.
5 singles.
Still, the story of the day was
Navas and Sroczynski. The two
have been key contributors to the
team for four years and were hon-
ored on the court with their fami-
lies before the match in a special
presentation.
"It was definitely emotional for
me," Sroczynski said. "I was for-
tunate enough to spend four great
years here and met a lot of people
that have helped me. It's sad, it's my
last match at home. It was difficult."
"The pre-match ceremony was
nice... but all of the emotions of the
day didn't really hit me until the
second set of singles," Navas said.

"I don't think I've been like that in
a long time. For the rest of my life,
I'll be really proud of my four years
here. I'll look back and remember
more than just the matches; I'll
remember the connection I had
with everyone else on the team. I
love this university and I'll always
be a part of this program in some
way or another."
Navas will have a quick transi-
tionfromthe life ofacollege athlete
to the real world. He startsworking
at Bank of America in late June, just
weeks after the season ends, while
Sroczynski will continue to pursue
tennis.
After the match, Berque had a lot
of praise for both players, lauding
their contributions to the program.
"I'm always going to have fond
memories of them, not just for the
success they have endured, but for
the commitment they have made to
this program," Berque said. "They
bring so much to this program and
this team, it was nice to see them
have a strong finish."


though it was 600 miles away.
"I gathered the team together
and told them, 'This is adversity,'
" Golder said. "The team that han-
dles the adversity the best is going
to win this championship."
And Michigan did just that.
Although junior Thomas Kelley
fell off the rings, four of his team-
mates scored above 15 to help
propel Michigan to first place-.3
points better than defending
champions Stanford, who finished
this year in second place.
Soon after, it was ruled that due
to the irregularities of the new set
of rings and the issues with the
ones that had broken, anybody
who had fallen off the rings would
be permitted a second attempt.
The scores weren't finalized until
.those second chances were grant-
ed.
Kelley took his second chance,
turning in a score of 14.750, good
for third on the squad to up the
Wolverines' score by .4. Kelley's
final performance widened the
gap between Michigan and the
Cardinal to .7 points., Michigan
was the very clear winner while
Illinois remained in fourth place.
Looking past their direct effect
on the team, they were the type of
leaders that the team needed to be
successful.
"It was great to have them stay
for the fifth year," junior Thomas
Kelley said. "They've been true
Wolverines for five years now. They
taught us what it meant to really
love Michigan and give it every-
thing you have. I remember telling
Kent right before his floor routine
to do it for Michigan, because that's
what he taught me."
The success they accomplished
this year didn't come easily. They
had to overcome many hurdles
early and later on in their careers
to achieve so much. Caldwell had
a torn stomach muscle as a sopho-
more, forcing him to have surgery.
And McCarthy broke his hand dur-
ing his freshman year, causing him
to redshirt.
"Losing is worse than injuries,"
Goldberg said. "When you lose, it
does a mental one on you. And to
bounce back and keep fighting, to
keep working through all the blood
sweat and tears, makes it all worth-
while."
These three, along with seniors

ROHAN'S SEASON CONTIN-
UES : Freshman Rohan Sebas-
tian, one of two freshmen on the
team, is scheduled to compete in
the European Championships for
Ireland this week and the compe-
tition will provide him with much
needed experience. Grover will be
coaching the Irish national team.
With only a year under his belt,
the learning curve remains high
for performing in competition -
and Golder loves the idea of any
extra experience for the fresh-
man.
"He still needs to learn how to
compete better," Golder said. "I
try to play the psychologist and
try to get a little sudden reinforce-
ment, some subtle hints. I have a
style of not making a big deal over
anything, just try to move in the
direction we have to go."
Sebastian competed on the
floor, the steel rings and the vault,
but only his vault score was count-
ed towards the NCAA Champion-
ship. Golder hopes practicing in
the high pressure situation will
help him to perform to his poten-
tial when the team needs him in
the future.
Torrance Laury will be missed next
year. But the departing seniors are
confident the team will continue
the success.
"You set the precedent by your
work ethic and what you preach,"
Goldberg said. "If you walk your
talk, the young guys will follow.
And that's what I told them at the
end of this championship. I was
like, 'Guys it doesn't end here. I
want this team to become a dynas-
ty With all the new freshmen com-
ing next year, these guys have to set
the tone and show these youngguys
what Michigan is all about."
Not only are the graduates con-
fident Michigan will continue its
recent success, but future leaders
on the team are also confident.
"(The leadership) will be really
important because we'll have a
young team next year," Kelley
said. "We have quite a few fresh-
men coming in, so it's going to be
a lot of seniors and a lot of fresh-
man. There's going to be a nice
established system in place for the
freshman to come into and take a
part of, so they'll know right away
what it means to be a Michigan
Wolverine the second they walk
into the gym."

BrandonGrhm'Inx
t arget: NFL quarterbacks

N obody ever beat Jake Long.
Long, the eventual first team All-
American, No.1 pick in the NFL Draft and
Pro Bowl left tackle, an always impenetra-
ble wall, stood tall against all challengers
- literally and physically.
The 6-foot-7 behemoth served as the
gatekeeper of the left side of Michigan's
offensive line from 2004-2007.
Then-head coach Lloyd Carr would
always pit a defensive lineman against an
offensive lineman in one-on-one practice
drills throughout the season.
Long was king, that is, until Brandon
Graham lined up across from him.
The 6-foot-1 defensive end, two years
younger than Long, unleashed his arsenal
of moves against the tackle - speed rush,
bull rush, whatever it took. Graham tested
his will against Long's to get to the quar-
terback.
"Once you got around him your confi-
dence went up and you see him get mad
for real," Graham recalled. "Then it's like,
'C'mon I'm serious now,' - like he wasn't
serious before."
These epic struggles lasted just two
years. Long eventually went on to play for
the Miami Dolphins, while Graham was
left to develop his game. A quarterback-
hungry defensive end with an insatiable
appetite, Graham's work ethic and motor
became legendary to those around the
program.
"Brandon is a very humble guy," Carr
said. "Nobody beat Jake Long, very
much. That was infrequent.

f~Tim Huan Datix Spo t Xr 

f you saw Graham around Ann Arbor
he'd come off unassuming, humble
even, certainly not the monster that came
to play on Saturday afternoons in the fall
- no, not him, they couldn't be the same
guy.
"He's just all smiles every time," fellow
captain Zoltan Mesko said. "I didn't know
someone could have so many smiles in
them throughout the day."
Graham's impact was felt on the field
during his junior and senior years as his
teammates voted him Bo Schembechler
Team MVP twice (the first time for a
defensive player in school history).
As a captain this past season, Graham
was the one who would get up in front of
his teammates and deliver speeches after
tough losses.
"They weren't forced, and that's what
I liked about it," Mesko said. "He really
came from his heart. People paid atten-
tion because it's generally what he meant,
what he felt about that certain situation,
so he spoke his mind and put it the right
way.
"It's easy to talk off adrenaline before a
game, but who's goingto be the guy to pick
the rest of the guys up after a game. He's
not about getting the attention because
it's before the game, 'Look at me how
hyped I am.' He's the guy who really loves
to get up one more time than he's fallen."
Graham tried to instill in his team-
mates the same fire, love and passion for
the game that he played with
every snap. A fter his junior
eyseason in 2008, Graham
could have made the jump
to the NFL, but he decided to
stay at Michigan to accomplish more.
"He was a guy who had humility," Carr
said. "You know when you make the tran-
sition from high school to college, if you
have those qualities, it makes your adjust-
ment a lot easier. Because (you) realize,
'I've got a lot to learn, (but) I'm confident
in my ability.'
"And the same thing applies when
you leave college and (go) to the NFL....
You have a better chance of fitting in and
being accepted and you have a work ethic
(too), then you're on your way."
The way Mesko and current coach
Rich Rodriguez talk about the graduating
senior, it's as if there's a conversion chart
for Graham's impact on the Wolverines.
Mesko said Graham was worth at least
three to four seniors, and Rodriguez said
last month that it would take all 12 of next
year's seniors to fill Graham's spot.
He led the team on the field through
his play and off the field with his speeches
and by example. NFL teams won't have to
spend too much time checking Graham's
background or being concerned with him
away from the game.
"I tell them, if you get me, I'm about
football and I'm about my business,"
Graham said. "You won't have to worry.
I'm not a risk off the field because I'm all
about football."

Before the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala-
bama, back in January, Graham start-
ed to get a little nervous. The guy who was
known for bone-crunching hits was let-
ting doubts about his own abilities creep
into his mind.
So he went and talked to his strength
coach, Mike Barwis.
"Man, this is my first time I'm gonna be
on stage," he told his coach.
"Do what got you there, and you'll be
fine," Barwis responded. "You play in front
of a hundred thousand people. The same
people you see down there will be watch-
ing you on TV, or watching you in the
stands, from scouts to just coaches. They
know what you're about. Just go out there
and do your thing."
And Graham did, to the tune of five
tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in
a game featuring the country's top senior
college football players. Graham took
home the game's MVP.
On display for all to see was what Mich-
igan fans have been witnessing for the
past two seasons - Graham's motor. It's
the first thing analysts talk about when
Graham is mentioned and it has almost
become synonymous with his name.
"When you say motor, you're talking
about a guy who's going as hard as he can
as fast as he can from the snap of the ball
to the whistle," Carr said. "And he doesn't
seem to allow fatigue to factor in and
that's due to his work ethic. But the natu-
ral explosiveness and the motor, those are
God-given talents."
Graham never takes a down off, and he
does a lot of his damage in the fourth quar-
ter after wearing down opposing tackles
throughout games.
"I don't think there's a guy in this draft
who plays with a better motor than Gra-
ham," Director of college football scout-
ing for ESPN Scouts Inc. Todd McShay
said. "It starts with the effort. From the
first play to the last play, he's just nonstop.
He really is. And I think he's technically
sound. He's the one guy who's in the posi-
tion he should be, doing the right things
and all that. I just think really the effort
and the toughness are what will impress
scouts the most."
When Graham got to Michigan in
2006, Carr probably gave him the
best advice to advance the young defensive
lineman's development.
"Hey, if you don't know what to do, just
watch LaMarr (Woodley)," Carr told him.
"Watch the way he practices. In meetings
make sure you're paying attention and you
can always ask him because he knows he's
been here. And if you try to model yourself
after him, then you couldn't have someone
better."
Woodley, who was a senior when Gra-
ham was a freshman, was selected as a
first-team All-American that year and was
drafted 46th overall in the second round of
the NFL Draft by the Steelers.
Since being drafted, Woodley has made

the transition from predominantly playing
defensive end in college to a full-time out-
side linebacker in the 3-4 for the Steelers.
And he has done it masterfully.
Woodley had six sacks in the 2008 play-
offs as Pittsburgh won all three of its play-
off games, including the Super Bowl. He
was an instrumental part of the modern-
day Steel Curtain.
Graham heeded Carr's advice and
soaked up everything he could during his
one year as Woodley's teammate.
Before Woodley graduated he gave his
prot6g6 some advice of his own.
"You're going to be a good player,"
Woodley told Graham. "Eventually you're
going to have to lead this team. You're
going tobe the man on this team."
And Graham did just that, following in
the tracks that Woodley had laid before
him.
The comparison is something Woodley
sees and acknowledges.
"It's a big similarity," Woodley said of
his play on the field and Graham's. "The
only thing is Brandon is faster than me. I
tell you that. Brandon is faster than me,
hands down faster than me. Other than
that, everything is the same."
In the NFL, Woodley made the Pro
Bowl for the first time in his career this
past season, and has posted 29 sacks in his
first three years in the league.
The two still stay in touch via text mes-
sages. Woodley will make sure Graham
is doing alright off the field and will also
offer advice on how Graham can improve
on it.
Woodley, at 6-foot-2 and 265 pounds,
is the physical and logical comparison to
Graham and he could be considered one
of the poster boys for making the switch
from the 4-3 to the 3-4.
"They always compared us," Woodley
said. "When (Graham) came out of high
school, they compared us. Leavingcollege,
they're comparing us again. It's actually a
good thing, because the team's that passed
up on me better not pass up on him."
Michigan's tradition of producing NFL
caliber talent is continuing with Gra-
ham. He had a chance to compete early
on against the likes of Long and alongside
Woodley - and other future NFL players.
Now, carries the pro-bound tradition that
has been ingrained in the historic pro-
gram.
"It felt good because just watching him
those two years before I got there, it was
like, 'Man, I'm playing with Woodley, I'm
playing with Mike Hart, Chad Henne, all
those guys,' " Graham said. "I was scared,
because it's like I've got to really come up
there and be able to fill their shoes. It felt
good, once I started seeing that I could do
it."
Before he even played a down of foot-
ball for Michigan, Graham found
himself in Carr's office facing a tough
decision. The Detroit native was recruited
as a linebacker coming out of high school

and weighed about 240 pounds during his
senior year of high school, as Carr recalls.
But when Graham showed up for summer
practices, he had gained 20 to 30 pounds.
So Carr decided to meet with the young
man.
"Now look, there's no way from a con-
ditioning standpoint that you can come in
here and play linebacker," Carr told him.
"I mean you're going to have to cut some
weight,"
He didn't cut any weight. So Carr gave
him an ultimatum.
"The best we can (do), is we can redshirt
you, or if you want to play, we'll put you
down and put you on the defensive line,"
Carr told him.
He wanted to play - was there any
doubt that he would?
The move paid off. But Graham feels
right at home now despite questions from
reporters, scouts and general manag-
ers speculating whether he can make the
transition from defensive end to standing
up and playing linebacker in a 3-4 defense.
He's been playing linebacker since he was
seven years old - it comes natural for Gra-
ham.
"He's one of those guys, he's got won-
derful explosion and burst and so he was a
natural," Carr said. "As I look at him, I've
had a lot of people call me from the NFL,
as I look at him, he can be a 4-3 defen-
sive end. But there's no doubt in my mind
that he can also be a stand-up linebacker,
because he's very athletic, very quick. So I
don't know what's going to happen to him.
But he gives any defensive coordinator
incredible flexibility."
With the growing popularity of the 3-4
defense in the NFL with the league split
about 50-50 between teams that predomi-
nantly run the 4-3 versus the 3-4 scheme,
the need for 'tweeners' like Graham has
soared in recent years. The transition from
playing with your hand on the ground to
starting every play standing up and having
to drop into coverage more as a linebacker
is a big move for defensive ends.
Guys who can play defensive end and
outside linebacker are valuable, but it's an
inexact science when it comes to evaluat-
ing who can make the switch to the 3-4.
"There's a little bit of a leap of faith
there with a lot of players who come into
the league and play outside linebacker in
a 3-4 system," Denver Broncos head coach
Josh McDaniels said. "A lot of them are
defensive ends and you've never seen them
stand up."
Green Bay Packers General Manager
Ted Thompson added: "There's more pro-
jecting of pass rushers to those 34 outside-
linebacker positions, it's a very difficult
thing to do. Because if a guy has never
stood up and played before, just because
he can run fast or do drills, it doesn't nec-
essarily mean that he can stand on his feet
and play the game. But it does work out
sometimes. As much as we can, we try and
stick with guys who have proven they can
play the game."

The switch doesn't work for everyone.
Before the 2009 season, when the Pack-
ers switched to a 3-4 defense, they decided
to keep their premier pass rusher Aaron
Kampman in the mix and shifted the
6-foot-4 260-pound defensive end to out-
side linebacker.
Kampman's season was cut short due
to injuries and in nine games he recorded
only 3.5 sacks.
Known for a motor of his own, Kamp-

managers who prefer their pass rushers to
be the taller prototype ends.
At just 6-foot-1, Graham is comparable
to the 5-foot-11 Dumervil and the 6-foot-0
Harrison.
Dumervil easily led the NFL in sacks
last year with 17, and Harrison is one year
removed from being the NFL's Defensive
Player of the Year, helpingthe Steelers win
a Super Bowl.
"That has changed with the growth of

you could do it, once a month, you'd feel

ly, some success against Jake, which told
us all that he was the real deal."
Graham ripped and clubbed his way
through Michigan's opponents through-
out his career and was named co-winner
of the Chicago Tribune Silver Football
last season, given to the best player in the
Big Ten as voted on by the coaches.
The 29.5 career sacks and 56 career
tackles for loss speak for themselves. And
all that production came in just 28 starts
at defensive end.
On Thursday, the first round of the
NFL Draft will take place in prime-
time and Graham has a good chance of
being among the first 32 selected.
His sights are set on NFL quarter-
backs now.
"What happens if you watch a game,
and all of a sudden a guy appears to
come from nowhere, and he did that I
can't tell you how many times," Carr
said. "All of a sudden, the quarterback
is there, he's looking down the field
and bang! He's on the ground. And
somebody has hit him and knocked him

I watched him."

man was a force off the edge for the Pack-
ers in the 4-3 defense, racking up 37 total
sacks the previous three seasons in the
system and was probably one of the rea-
sons he was signed by the Jacksonville
Jaguars this past offseason after leaving
the Packers.
Graham, on the other hand, has had
experience standing up before his time as
a Wolverine, and even stood up a little in
some plays while at Michigan and dropped
back into coverage.
"I knew I always wanted to stand up,
because that was my dream, coming out
playing that linebacker (position)," Gra-
ham said. "on the D-line I had to adjust.
I think I'll fit straight in as soon as I get
back.
"I feel good coming off (the edge). I got
the speed and strength to come off that
ball. And most tackles are scared of that.
After every game I always get a compli-
ment about (my) tackling. That's always
been my dream for somebody to come
compliment me after a game."
It all came together for Graham: the
pursuit, the motor, the pass-rush moves
and the ability. It might not matter which
position he plays in the NFL - he can do
either.
There's one thing that's never going to
change nomatter what scheme a teamruns
- gettingito the quarterback is important.
"That's unbelievably valuable in our
league," Thompson said.
When Graham's name is called dur-
ing the NFL Draft he may have to
send thank you cards to the Denver Bron-
cos' Elvis Dumervil and the Pittsburgh
Steelers' James Harrison. The pair paved
the way for Graham to make an impact in
the NFL despite narrow-minded general

the tackles," Steelers Director of Football
operations Kevin Colbert said of the stero-
typical thinking. "As the tackles get taller,
they have a little more trouble with the
Elvis Dumervil's and James Harrison's
who aren't quite 6-(foot)-3 because they're
great leverage players. I don't think you
ever want to get locked into a prototypical
size, we all want that, but you can't shut
out a good player just because he mightnot
be 6-(foot)-3."
But both of those players play as out-
side linebackers in 3-4 defenses, a posi-
tion Graham might be asked to switch to
because of his lack of height.
Graham plays with leverage though,
even against tackles who are much taller
than him and often have more than 50
pounds on him. One way to combat a lack
of size is having long arms to work around
bigger tackles. But Graham's arms are just
over 32 inches long, almost four inches
shorter than Dumervil's. It's those long
arms that McDaniels attributes to Dumer-
vil's success.
Without the arm length, Graham has to
play with that leverage and avoid staying
in the shadow of towering tackles when
the ball is snapped. In the NFL, there is
no shortage of tall good offensive tackles,
especially considering that the average
height of offensive tackles selected to the
2010 Pro Bowl was over 6-foot-5.
Either way, whether he stays as a 4-3
defensive end or switches to become a 3-4
outside linebacker, Graham knows how to
get to the quarterback. Scouts and coaches
who have watched his tape leading up to
the draft can see that, he's a pass rusher no
matter where you play him.
"I look for a good player," Thompson
said. "There are probably ideal heights
and lengths and stuff like that in terms of

the body makeup that you look for, but it
doesn't necessarily translate into the best
3-4 outside linebacker."
With his stout stature and sneakily fast
speed, Graham can use a whole book of
moves on a left tackle when trying to get
to the quarterback. It may have helped
him best Jake Long years ago, and it
makes up for his lack of height at the posi-
tion.
"Leverage and hands," McShay said
of how Graham overcomes his size. "He
does a good job of staying low not let-
ting offensive linemen get into his body
as much. And he does a great job of get-
ting offensive linemen's hands off, swim
moves, rips, clubs, all those different
techniques. He has a lot in his bag he pulls
out in terms of pass rush moves and just
ways to disengage, and I think that really
helps him."
Like Dumervil, who was initially
undervalued because of his size and
widely considered a situational pass
rusher instead of an every-down player,
and like Harrison who went undrafted,
Graham is a guy anyone would want on
their team because of the heart, because
of the motor, and maybe most important-
ly because of his will.
"Even though I'm 6-1, or whatever size
I am, I've got the heart to go out there and
compete with everybody any size, it don't
matter," Graham said. "Because between
those lines it doesn't matter, it's all about
mentality."
It's almost fitting that the start of Gra-
ham's Michigan career didn't exactly
go the way one might have expected.
The intense worker, who always
brought his best on the field fell asleep
while sitting at an abdominal machine
in the early afternoon of one of his first
workouts on the football team. Mesko
said the guys gave him a hard time about
it, but Graham's career as a Wolverine
certainly finished with a bang.
Graham had seven tackles and two
sacks in his last game at Michigan, wrap-
ping up a senior year with 26.5 tackles for
loss and 10.5 sacks.
"I think he's a great football player,"
McShay said. "He's a monster. He's
strong, tough, technically sound."
McShay said that he would easily take
Graham somewhere in the top-20 picks
in the draft. But Graham's goal is to be
picked in the top 10. Still, his mindset is
going to be the same, no matter where he
goes or what position he plays.
"I've just said that I'm going to go out
there and compete," he said. "And I've
asked them what they want to see from
me, since I'm so small. I think they want
to see (me) to go out there and work hard.
"I just go with my motor, I just know
I'm going to get to the ball on every play.
I'm going tobe around the ball on film on
every play. That's what I take pride in."
The motor man is going to keep on
going, and going and going.
