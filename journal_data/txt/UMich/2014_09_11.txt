Ridesharing' legality in
IA still under evaluation

Limousine drivers
bemoan varied
regulations
By JACK TURMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Following the Ann Arbor
City Council's resolution to fur-
ther regulate ridesharing com-

panies in the city, traditional
taxi companies are frustrated
with the exceptions granted to
companies such as Uber and
Lyft.
Last week, councilmem-
bers voted to request that City
Administrator Steve Powers
negotiate operating agree-
ments, which included lia-
bility insurance, passenger
safety and vehicle inspection,

with ridesharing companies.
Contrary to traditional taxi or
limousine services, rideshar-
ing companies employ non-pro-
fessional drivers who use their
own vehicles.
Uber, which uses a smart-
phone app to connect drivers
and riders, has multiple trans-
portation services. However,
the service that has faced the
most scrutiny is UberX, Uber's

driving service with less-
stringent driver requirements.
Michigan residents have ques-
tioned this service because
some believe that it violates
the 1990 Michigan Limousine
Transportation Act.
Under the Act, limousine
drivers are required to obtain
commercial insurance, have
their vehicle inspected, register

DINNERTIME

Doximity ranks
12 specialty
programs in top 10
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
The rankings are still roll-
ing in.
Starting Wednesday, a web-
site called Doximity began
offering ranks of different
medical residency programs
across the country, and the
University of Michigan Health
System stood out among the
3,700 programs listed.
Doximity is a social net-
working site for doctors. The
rankings are based on input
from physicians, who give
their opinions on the top resi-
dency programs within their
specialties. Of the 20 residency
programs ranked, 12 UMHS
programs ranked in the top 10
in their fields, including Anes-
thesiology, Dermatology, and
Surgery. Most of the other
eight programs placed in the
top 20, with the lowest, pediat-

rics, ranking at 22.
Doximity's Residency Navi-
gator is the first of its kind.
According to Monica Lypson,
interim assistant dean for
graduate medical education,
residency programs have never
been ranked before. Previ-
ously, people looked at overall
hospital rankings to assess
the strength of residency pro-
grams.
"Since most training pro-
grams happen in a hospital
where teaching occurs, people
would assume that if a hospital
got ranked at a certain level,
then the residency programs
would follow," Lypson said.
"There really hasn't been clear
rankings for residency pro-
grams."
The rankings did not come a
moment too soon. Applications
for residencies that start in
September 2015 are due in less
than a week. Students unsure
of where they can receive the
best possible physician train-
ing now have a resource avail-
able to help them choose.
Lypson said the University's

By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
The debates - or lack there of -

Grand Rapids television station
WOOD-TV had a debate scheduled
Mondayeveningbetweenthe Repub-

running for U.S. Senate - Terri Lynn
Land, former Michigan Secretary of
State, and U.S. Rep. Gary Peters (D-

However, because Land did not
reply to the station's invitation to
the debate, WOOD-TV postponed
the event. Peters, who had accepted
his invitation, held a forum in Grand
Rapids where he "debated" an empty
chair with Land's name on it.
The postponement was the lat-

whether a public debate between the
two candidates will be held before
the November general election. A

Quarterback is
OK after Saturday
"cheap shot"
By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSportsEditor
In his time at Michigan,
Devin Gardner has been a
backup quarterback, a starting

wide receiver and the face of
the football program.
Now in his second full
season under center, the
fifth-year senior has received
significant criticism for his role
in the Wolverines' struggles,
particularly following his
performance Saturday against
Notre Dame.
But coach Brady Hoke
believes the harsh reactions

are unwarranted.
"You're going to have opin-
ions. That's fine," Hoke said at
Wednesday's press conference.
"When your quarterback takes
some criticism, that might be
unjust because of things that
transpired. I guess that's the
way we are as a society now.
But at the same time, I don't
know if that's called for.

Living in the Dark Ages

For a student, knowledge is power.
But that kind of power doesn't help
whenastormknocksoutyourelectric-
ity for a few days - and that's exactly
what happened to LSA junior Tucker
Schumacher and his five roommates.
Their power went out last Friday,
and they were subsequently stuck in
the dark for four days. Schumacher
had gone home for the weekend, and
though his roommates informed him

via text that they lost electricity, he
forgot about it until his return Mon-
day night.
"I went to my room, flipped on the
light switch and nothing happened,"
Schumacher said, adding that this
barred him from doing any work
there. "I had to go to the bathroom in
the dark. I had to shower in the dark.
Pretty much I had to do everything in
the dark"

The outage spared one working
outlet in the home, which meant that
all six roommates were forced to
share. Luckily, they had a power strip
handy to extend their device charging
capabilities and ultimately avoid any
squabbles.
Food also became an issue for the
students, Schumacher said, as their
stove would not work during the
power outage.

"I was forced to basically provide
BTB (Cantina) with their monthly
revenue by myself," he said. "They're
right next to our house. I mean, damn
it, it's good."
The loss of power was resolved
Tuesday, Schumacher said, and now
all is well. In fact, he found the experi-
ence illuminating.

high ranking should result in a more
dense applicant pool.
Even without extra applicants, the
University's residency programs are
extremely competitive. UMHS cur-

rently has 1,199 residents. This year, it
brought in 379 new residents, and Lyp-
son said UMHS usually takes between
300 and 400 per year. The number of
applicantsvaries from program to pro-
gram. In the internal medicine pro-
gram, only 1.5 percent of applicants
were acceptedfor the2014 cycle.
Most residencies last between

three and seven years, depending on
the specialty.
In spite of the potential benefits of
a larger applicant pool for the Univer-
sity and more information for medi-
cal students, Lypson did mention a
possible drawback to the rankings.
She said students may feel inclined
to apply to the top-ranked programs

rather than those that they feel would
best suit their needs.
"When you are trying to weigh so
many possibilities, one of the ways to.
shorten your list is to go to these rank-
ings to help you start to make some
decisions," she said. "Sometimes that
lessens a student's ability to really
make the best choice for themselves."


DEBATES
From Page 1A
which Democratic challenger Mark
Schauer and Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder have yet to accept invitations
to the same debate.
In the Senate race, Peters has
called for multiple televised debates
and has accepted invitations from
Michigan State University, WXYZ
and the League of Women Voters
along with the postponed WOOD-
TV debate, none of which Land has
replied to. The Peters campaign
announced Tuesday that Peters'
debate negotiator John Cherry, lieu-
tenant governor under Jennifer Gra-
nholm, would work to set up planning
meetings with Land and groups who
have offered to host debates.
"This is the first open U.S. Sen-
ate seat in over 20 years," said Zade
Alsawah, deputy communications
director for Peters' campaign. "And
that's why Gary feels it is so impor-
tant that Michiganders hear from
both candidates on the issues that
matter most."
The Senate seat Peters and Land
are competing for is currently held
by Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, who
announced last year that he would be
retiring and would not seek another

term. Levin has represented Michi-
gan for more than 30 years since win-
ning his first race in 1978.
Land spokeswoman Heather Swift
wrote in an e-mail that the campaign
is currently evaluating opportuni-
ties for debates. Following the Peters
event in Grand Rapids, Swift said he
has differences in his Congressio-
nal Record and campaign material
regarding issues such as equal pay,
immigration and outsourcing.
"It's only appropriate that Gary
Peters's first debate would be against
Gary Peters," Swift wrote. "Con-
gressman Gary and Candidate Gary
disagree on the issues that matter to
Michiganvoters."
Aaron Kall, director of the Univer-
sity of Michigan Debate Team, said
when it came to the state Senate race,
it was unusual to see no debate in a
race without incumbents. He pointed
to Land's previous public speaking
experiences, however - she has most-
ly spoken from notes and in smaller
settings - asa potential explanation.
"Because there's no incumbent,
both candidates are going to be less
known by the public," Kall said.
"Debates, several of them, would give
both candidates the opportunity to
introduce themselves and make their
positions more clear."

their limousine for $50 pnd have
a Certificate of Authority, which
is a one-time fee of $300 with a
renewal fee of $50.
Uber Michigan Manager
Michael White said UberX driv-
ers are usually part-time driv-
ers who are students over 21 and
retirees trying to make money to
pay off student loans or pay bills.
White added that UberX driv-
ers have to pass federal, state
and county background checks, a
driving record review, a mechani-
cal vehicle inspection and online
safety training.
However, UberX drivers
use their own vehicles and are

required to have their own Michi-
gan insurance policy rather than
commercial insurance, which is
the center of the argument.
White said whenever an UberX
driver is transporting someone,
he or she is covered by Uber's
primary commercial insurance
policy, which includes $1 million
of liability insurance.
"Any time that that person is
actually providing transportation
to somebody, they are covered by
a commercial insurance policy
that meets or exceeds the state
requirements for a limousine and
is more than double the require-
ments for an Ann Arbor taxi,"
White said.
Michael Frezell, communica-
tions manager for the Michigan
Department of Transportation,

and John Heed, former chief
operating officer of Select Ride -
the parent company of Arbor Lim-
ousine and Yellow Car - argue
that UberX violates the Limou-
sine Transportation Act because
it does not require drivers to
have a chauffeur's license, acom-
mercial vehicle plate or full-time
commercial insurance.
According to MDOT, UberX
drivers can be pulled over by
police officers, pay a maximum
$500 fine and face imprisonment
Frezell also said UberX drivers
selectively using the commercial
insurance from Uber and their
personal insurance while trans-
porting individuals is putting the
driver at risk.
"Your own personal insurance
for your vehicle will state that if

you operate a vehicle ina for-hire
commercial basis, your policy is
not valid if you get into an acci-
dent," Frezell said.
Heed said by not having to pay
for a chauffeur's license, rideshar-
ing companies are at an economic
advantage compared to compa-
nies with commercially insured
vehicles.
"They can be cheaper because
they geta huge price advantage of
not obeying laws that are on the
books," Heed said.
When Uber came to the Detroit
area last year, MDOT notified the
company about the Limousine
Transportation Act by sending
them a letter in December. Frezell
said they have not received a
response from Uber.
"It's not like the company isn't

aware of the law," Frezell said.
White believes that Uber is not
breaking the law because the idea
of connecting riders and drivers
through technology was not con-
sidered.
"The whole idea of what we're
doing was not even conceptual-
ized yet," White said. "That was
not written to address the type of
service we're providing asa tech-
nology company."
Councilmember Sally Petersen
(D-Ward 2), a sponsor of the reso-
lution passed last week, said the
first step in addressing these com-
panies is the operating agreement.
From the operating agreement,
she said she hopes state lawmak-
ers can recognize the significance
of this issue and draft legislation.
White said Uber is happy to

work with Michigan and its cit-
ies to draft legislation that would
emphasize the transparency of its
pricing and its quality of service.
"We're open to working with
both the state and the cities in
Michigan in order to put in place
regulations that would apply to
our service aslong as they provide
for economic development, pro-
vide for competition and provide
for consumer safety," White said.
However, Heed said UberX
needs to obey law as it has been
written - not as it suits them.4.
"Until the laws change, they
should comply with the law,"
Heed said. "If they are complying
with the law, there is no reason for
an operating agreement. If they
aren'tcomplying with the law, the
operating agreement is not legal."

these training items."
In a statement, the University's
NROTC unit apologized for the

incident and said it resulted from
a break of standard operating
procedures and subsequent mis-
understanding.
"One midshipman was in pos-
session of a rubberized, non-firing
training weapon," the statement

- -o5S

read. "Weunderstand the implica-
tions and optics of armed persons
appearing on college campuses
and the serious concern and
response caused ... The midship-
man should nothave attempted to
transport this equipment through
campus while on foot, out of uni-
form and formation."
The statement also said the
unit would "implement proce-
dures to ensure this mistake
does not recur." In addition,
Commander Scott Howell, exec-
utive officer of the University's
NROTC unit, said in an inter-
view that in a typical situation,
training weapons are transport-
ed ina less conspicuous manner,
which would avoid alarmingstu-
dents.
Howell said if NROTC stu-
dents or officers are not in uni-
form and in formation while
holding the training weapons,
the students are either in a van
or holding the weapon in bags or
cases around campus.
Kinesiology sophomore Vic-
toria Norris was in a lecture in
one of the Chemistry Building's
auditoriums when the first alert
went out. She said a student sit-

ring in the front of the class stood
up and showed the professor the
message, at which point, she said,
"everyone started kind of panick-
ing."
The students ultimately
worked together to turn off the
lights, shut down the projector,
silence their phones and shel-
ter themselves under desks and
between seats, she said.
Norris added that the students
neither saw nor heard anything
suspicious, and some hadn't even
received the emergency alert in
the first place. She received hers
solelyvia e-mail, even though she is
signed up to receive textwarnings.
"We had absolutely no idea,"
she said. "And actually, a lot of
people didn't get the alert until
minutes after it had already hap-
pened. I didn't get the alert until
about 10 minutes after they had
already cleared it.
"It was probably the scariest
thing that ever happened to me,"
Norris added.
Norris wasn't the only stu-
dent to receive delayed warn-
ings, an issue that Neumann said
"depends alot on the technologies
involved."

Inclement weather, service
providers and other related inter-
mediary systems were cited as
potential reasons for scattered
message receipt times, something
that Neumann said University
Police are constantly working to
improve.
Some students, including Nor-
ris, said the e-mail alerts were
significantly more delayed than
the texts. University Police said
e-mail is not expected to be the
primary mechanism for emer-
gency messaging as it is not the
fastest way to reach students.
Regardless, University Police said
the hope is that sending the mes-
sages over a variety of media will
reach a large area of the campus
community.
"We're always trying to get
the best technology to help us
make those mass notifications,"
Neumann said. "We continue to
evaluate each emergency alert to
try and find ways to make it bet-
ter. In this case, we would say the
system worked."
LSA sophomore Eldar Hoessel,
an office assistant in the Housing
Information Office, agreed that
the system worked. The office is

stationed in the Student Activities
Building and went into lockdown
after Hoessel's boss received the
notification about a potential
gunman.
"It was kind of shocking,
because no one really expects
that (to happen)," Hoessel said. "I
thought it was a good effort. I felt
pretty safe, just because I think
that thetiming of everything (was
good) in case it was actually areal
emergency."
Though the notification sys-
tem appears to have been effec-
tive, Norris was concerned by the
content of the alert informing the
campus community once the situ-
ation was resolved.
"It was never clear as to what
actually happened," she said.
Though the information
became available onthe DPS web-
site, Norris felt that a text follow-
up would have been beneficial.
"If we got that text right away,
I would say 99 percent of students
are going to have their phones on
them, so it's going to be the quick-
est way to communicate with the
student body," she said.

Dowling begins
second season

'M' hoops aces 'The Program'

By MATTHEW KIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
Year one is in the books for
Michigan women's golf coach
Jan Dowling. This fall, though,
four of the seven athletes on
her roster will be beginning
the first year of their own
Wolverine careers.
Freshmen Megan Kim,
*Kathy Lim, Emily White and
sophomore transfer Julia
Montgomery will replace all four
graduated players, immediately
looking to revitalize a team that
finished 11th

in the Big Ten
Tournament
last year.
"We have
four new
faces, which is
very exciting,"
Dowling said.

"Havingi
is a reju
feels

"I think they
are going
to push each other this year
and make some noise very
quickly. Having new faces is a
rejuvenating feeling."
With more than three weeks
of practice under their belts,
the new players already have a
strong grasp of mechanics, but
developing consistency is what
sets elite golfers apart.
"They know how to play golf,
that hasn't changed," Dowling
said. "You have got to make sure
you are taking care of all the
elements outside of golf. If they
adjust to the outside well, their
games are going to be just fine."
Dowling will rely on her
three returning players this
year to lead her team and its
newest members. Senior Lauren
Grogan, junior Catherine Peters
and sophomore Grace Choi will
anchor the team as the new
members make the transition.
Last year, Grogan, Peters
andChoi were Michigan's most
consistent golfers, making up
three of only four golfers to
start all 10 tournaments for the
Wolverines. Choi led the team
with an average score of 75.64,
while Grogan and Peters were
not far off, averaging a 77 and
GARDNER
From Page 1A
"He's a kid. He's not a
professional athlete."
In South Bend, Indiana,
Gardner went 19-for-32 passing
for 189 yards, averaging 5.9
yards per completion and
guiding the offense into field
goal range in its first two
drives. But the quarterback also
accounted for four turnovers
- three interceptions and a
fumble - and the Wolverines
never reached the red zone.
"Was he perfect? No. He
wasn't 100 percent," Hoke said.
"Do we want to be perfect? Yes."
After the game, Hoke
explained that the several
factors were at fault for the
program's first scoreless
performance since 1984,
mentioning the offensive line,
the receivers' routes and Notre
Dame's defensive adjustments.
"When those things happen,
it happens as a team," Hoke said.
Despite Saturday's blowout,
Gardner and the first-team
offense remained in the game

Following an interception,

"Our

that takes time. We trust in our
process, and we are going to go

The Wolverines struggled
in the fall portion of the
schedule last year, never

"He's our quarterback," Hoke
said. "He's proved it how he's

OH, LINE: Though Michigan
rushed for just 100 yards
Saturday, its offensive line was
serviceable enough for Hoke.
"Right now, we like the group
wehave,"the coach said."They're
not making many mistakes."
Saturday's line consisted of
freshman Mason Cole at left
tackle, redshirt sophomore
Erik Magnuson at right guard,
redshirt junior Graham
Glasgow at right guard, redshirt
sophomore Ben Braden at right
tackle and redshirt junior Jack
Miller at center.
The Wolverines averaged 2.9
yards per carry, but the backs
found some success, especially
early in the contest.
Sophomore Derrick Green
had a seven-yard carry on
Michigan's first possession, and
De'Veon Smith followed with a
nine-yard burst later in the first
quarter.
But the backs had only one
carry of more than five yards in

the second half.
Hoke hinted that perhaps
some of the blame fell on the
backfield, which may have
missed holes created by the
offensive line.
"The guys up front, they
weren't perfect, but you can't
put it all on them," Hoke said.
KENNY KICK?: Matt Wile's
first two games haven't exactly

The senior kicker went 1-for-

then missed both attempts in
South Bend. And that might be
enough for a change.
Hoke said Wile and redshirt
sophomore Kenny Allen are
"fighting like heck" in practice
for the starting role.
Allen has made two collegiate
appearances but has never
attempted a field goal.

Nostalgia sparks Smith.in last year

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
Leslie Smith has a lot of
stories to tell about field hockey,
but her favorite took place on
the sidelines of a high school
state championship game when
a former coach and Michigan
player called her a Wolverine for
the first time.
Just thinking about that story
gets her choked up, she says.
Smith, a redshirt senior, played
her firstgame for the recreational
league Weed Whackers in
kindergarten. Later this fall,
she'll play her last in college.

But one thing isn't lost among
the myriad memories and
nostalgia - Smith is determined
to make this season count. So far,
she has.
In just four games, Smith
has netted five goals to lead all
Michigan players, and she has
emerged as the team's top option
on set plays.
The offensive production has
been remarkable, even compared
to her 2013 totals, when she led
the team with 10 assists. All five
tallies have come inthe last three
games, including a pair of multi-
goal efforts against William &
Mary and Central Michigan,

and a dramatic overtime-forcing
score as time expired against
Wake Forest.
Michigan coach Marcia
Pankratz called Smith a big-time
player after the back's effort led
the Wolverines to a 2-0 win over
William & Mary.
"Being the old lady on the
team, I've definitely learned
a lot in my past few years,"
Smith ,said. "This is my last
chance to make a statement, to
make my name known, to give
everything I can to Michigan
field hockey. I came in with
that kind of attitude knowing
this is my last shot."
The bounce in Smith's voice
doesn't betray any hint of
sadness about her final season.
Instead, the Michigan back
with a nose for set-piece goals
talks like a girl raised in the
sport's heartland.
Smith, a Hershey,
Pennsylvania native, tells story
after story about her career, her
teammates and what it means to
be a Wolverine. She talks about
loving the pressure of overtime,
tells stories of club coaches who
set her in front of a net with
buckets of balls and warns about
the self-admitted poor dance
,moves she likes to bust out in the
locker room.
Smith fondly remembers the
private lessons her dad arranged
with former Michigan standout
Kelly Fitzpatrick and admits her
teammates would probably call
her the team goofball.

After Michigan's
disappointing 2013 finish, the
offense Smith is generating is
crucial to a team which has
struggled to score with a young
front line.
As the set-piece specialist,
though, Smith is no stranger to
scoring in spurts.
Smith has always had a knack
for burying the ball off set plays.
Though she's a defender, the
steady cockiness and hint of flair
she carries onto the field is not
unlike that of a striker taking a
penalty or a clutch kicker staring
down a field goal.
"I love that feeling of now
or never, do or die," Smith
said. "You have to have a lot of
confidence. "You have to put
that look on your face like, 'I'm
the best, I can do it, and no one's
going to beat me."'
It's a mental game that Smith
wins frequently, and one that
promises to keep her a focal
point of the offense this year.
She brought that same
attitude everywhere, from club
teams, to the Hershey High
School Trojans and even to a
stint with USA Field Hockey.
But this last stop at Michigan
has been even more special.
Smith remembers thinking
on the sideline of that state
championship game about all
the Wolverine alumni she would
be representing while in college.
This fall, she's determined not
to waste her last opportunity to
make them proud.

The housing headache
As students scramble, help is needed to navigate the housing market
n.light of the recent overflow of students from University
Housing, other concerns facing the student housing
market have surfaced. Due of the University's apparent
shortage of student housing, thousands of students are forced to
enter the Ann Arbor's housing market each year - now subject
to the questionable business practices of property management
companies in the city. Furthermore, the pressures of the open
market and the timing of University Housing sign up leaves
too many students gambling on their housing situation in
the next year. While there are University programs in place
to help students with off-campus housing, there remains a
need for additional assistance. Furthermore, the City of Ann
Arbor must more closely monitor leasing practices in the city's
housing market.

Vapors and vapers

t tou mean I can smoke
these indoors?!?"
So goes the typical
reaction of
an American
cigarette smoker
examining their
first electronic
cigarette. It's
a revelation
in a country
where, unlike
the rest of the ELI
world, cigarette CAHAN
smokers must
crawl outside,
tail between their legs, to satisfy
their craving. The pitch only gets
betterwhenthemarketinggeniuses
at Blu tell smokers that "vapor,
rather than smoke" has cured
their impending cancer prognoses.
Sounds like a-miracle - all thanks
to our good friends at Big Tobacco.
But could it really be true? There
certainly seems to be some allure to
the blue glow in the hazy nightclub.
And yet, the health facts on e-cigs
are just that - hazy.
Scientifically, though it's true
that e-cigs vaporize liquid, rather
than flaming tar, to create the
"smoke" effect, the data remains
inconclusive on the health
implications of the vapor. Though
they have been shown to contain
fewer carcinogenic substances
than the nicotine tar present in
traditional cigarettes, the market
is highly unregulated and harmful
substances have been found in
liquid samples.
Additionally, since other
smokeless tobacco products, such
as snuff or dip, have been shown
to cause numerous cancers, there
is fear that e-cigs might induce an
analogous problem.
Further concerns parallel the
technical name for e-cigs, which
is "Electronic Nicotine Delivery
Systems" (ENDS): The name still
speaks to the addictive nature of
the product.
So there is concern that while
e-cigs might well reduce cancer cases
amonglong-timesmokers,theymight

also prove a "gateway substance"
for new, prospective smokers. The
theory is threefold: First, regarding
the addictive nature of nicotine;
second, regarding the pleasurable
"burning" sensationuponinhalation;
third, regarding the mimicked
"pulling motion" of hand to mouth.
Accordingly, the Centers for Disease
Control released a report in 2013
showing that the number of e-cig
smokers under l8years old doubledin
the past two years. The CDC recently
released another report saying that
the number of youths who have
"tried" e-cigs tripled between 2011
and 2013. Big Tobacco's aggressive
marketing campaigns (spending
increased tenfold from 2010 to 2012)
and creative "candy" flavors are
indicative of its awareness of this $3
billion future "market opportunity,"
so to speak.
The counterargument regarding
e-cigs' benefits is made by a study
conducted by the University of
Nottingham. The study, by looking
at recent statistics in the United
Kingdom as well as illustrative.
case studies in

All of this came to a head in the
recent report released by the World
Health Organization. In the report,
WHO recommended regulatory
action against e-cigs equivalent to
that of typical cigarettes, claiming
the potential risks are greater than
the benefits. Of particular concern
is the idea that e-cigs might
"perpetuate the smokingepidemic,"
through "glamorization" and
"implicit targeting of minors." Big
Tobacco, as well as various public
health experts, immediately fought
the report, claiming that proposed
regulation would be "overly
restrictive" and would limit the
health benefits of the product.
So what does all of this mean
for us? In my opinion, it means
that e-cigs will only increase in
prevalence. Powerful lobbying
campaigns in Washington and
marketing campaigns on television
are seductive, especially when they
addresshealthstigmas.Furthermore,
as we've seen with trends in the food
industry with labels like "organic"

As of 2013, total student enrollment
was 43,710. The University only houses
about 9,500 undergraduate students in 18
different residence halls and apartments.
There are also only 1,100 apartments for
graduate students and their families on
North Campus. An additional 600 spots for
single graduate students will be added when
Munger Hall opens in Fall 2015. During the
Fall 2013 semester, 28,283 undergraduates
were enrolled at the University. Freshmen,
however, are the only undergraduates
guaranteed a spot in University Housing,
and about 98 percent accept first-year
dormitory positions. According to statistics
from the office of the Registrar and the
University Housing website, 66 percent of
undergraduate students live off campus
- not necessarily by choice. While it's of
course impossible for the University to
generate more physical land near campus
for dormitories, it's important for the
administration to continually search for new
and creative ways to guarantee housing to a
larger portion of the student population.
Many undergraduates begin looking for
and enter into leasing agreements for the next
academic year within weeks of a semester's
start. This early rush for off-campus housing
places non-freshman undergraduates in an
uncomfortable situation. Since the signup
for university Housing opens and closes
in mid- to late January, non-freshmen who
want to sign up for University dorms must
forgo the chance to solidify reasonably
priced and located housing for the following
academic year. Furthermore, since every
freshman is guaranteed one of the 9,500
available residence hall spaces, less than half
of University living spaces are open to non-
freshmen. Looking at the student enrollment
numbers from the previous five years, this
means that the University has been unable to
accommodate at least 80 percent of all non-
freshmen undergraduates. With such poor
odds, returning students who wish to live in
University dorms are stuck taking the serious
risk of being rejected by University Housing
due to space constraints. Not only are these
students left without a guaranteed place to
live, having missed the rush for leases early in
the fall semester, many are stuck in a seller's
market with few quality prospects.
This is a tough predicament to resolve,
but one way to begin remedying it is to fix a
loophole in Ann Arbor's Housing Code. The
code states that landlords aren't permitted
to "... enter into an agreement to rent the
leased premises to another tenant for a
subsequent lease period until 70 days of the
current lease period has passed," nor are
they permitted to show these properties
during this same time period. Despite these

restrictions, many students searching for off-
campus housing find themselves signing pre-
lease agreements with property companies
and going on unaccompanied tours well
before the required wait period has passed.
Landlords, in order to sidestep these Housing
Code regulations, often have students sign
"Priority Lease Agreements" as early as mid-
September. These agreements simply state
that the students are legally bound to sign a
lease for a certain property when it becomes
available after the 70-day wait period, and
are often obligated to pay a deposit for the
property upon signing these preliminary
agreements. In addition, landlords ask their
currentresidentstoshowcasetheirrespective
houses to other students who are interested
in leasing them for the next school year.
These tours are unofficial and employees of
the leasing company are absent. In doing
so, this sidesteps the 70-day wait period for
opening properties to tours. If Ann Arbor can
close these pre-lease contract loopholes, the
city will at least give students more time to
weigh their already difficult choices.
Non-freshman students who live off-
campus constitute a large population of
captive customers who mustlivenear campus,
or otherwise commute. In recent years, high-
rise apartments such as Landmark, Varsity,
Sterling 411 Lofts, Zaragon Place and Zaragon
West have been constructed close to Central
Campus. These complexes are expensive -
prohibitively so in many cases. High-rise
apartments aren't the only exorbitantly
expensive housing in Ann Arbor; based
on the city's average rent figures, it's more
economically sound to purchase a house
instead of renting after 2.6 years.
The University has shown that it cares
about itsstudents seeking off-campus housing
through its Beyond the Diag program.
In order to maintain some semblance of
equitability, however, the University should
make itself more available to students who
are looking for off-campus, non-university
housing. It might also consider using its
substantial influence as an economic force in
the city to act as an advocate for its students
by reporting - and thus, hopefully preventing
- the kinds of loopholes in the Housing Code
that put students in stressful and precarious
predicaments. In addition, the city should be
more vigilant in enforcing its own legislation,
ensuring property management companies
follow Housing Code standards more closely.
Between expensive pricing and the business
practices of housing operations, the current
state of the student housing market is
bleeding many students' funds and cornering
them into unwanted and less-than-ideal
situations when searching for and leasing off-
campus housing.

alternatives to cigarettes have
shown marked decreases in lung
cancer rates. Thus, the study
concludes that while information
on e-cigs remains inconclusive,
they may prove a useful tool as a
smokeless alternative for nicotine
users, an important opportunity
worth consideration for public
health organizations globally.
This is the same argument that
traditional tobacco companies
(Lorillard, Phillip Morris, Altria,
Reynolds, etc.) are backing and
lobbying for.

and having to stick around until the
last possible day of finals.
It felt odd, then, to attend last Fri-
day's ceremony inaugurating Mark
Schlissel as the 14th president of the
University of Michigan and to hear
him speak about the future of the
University. In his speech, Schlis-
sel emphasized his priorities for
the University as a public institu-
tion, focusing on the importance of
diversity, accessibility and appreci-
ation of all voices. He expressed his
desire for the University to address
the world's biggest challenges
through liberal education and the
promotion of cultural understand-
ing alongside the pursuit of scien-
tific and technological advances.
For students current and future,
though, no part of Schlissel's
speech will have been more impor-
tant than his statement that "stu-
dents and their parents must hear
clearly and rest secure that the Uni-
versity of Michigan values curios-
ity and intellect, not ZIP codes or
family income." With those words,
Schlissel echoed another presiden-
tial address: one given by James B.
Angell in 1879. Angell, the Univer-
sity's third president as well as the
namesake of a large campus build-
ing and a leadership organization,
argued in his speech that the Uni-
versity's greatest task is "to reach
with our best training men drawn
from all classes, from all pursuits in
life, and men who are to return to
all honorable and worthy vocations

... in all parts of the land," and that
"it is by this diffusion of the edu-
cated men ... that a great school of
learning does its highest work."
Judging from the amount of time
he has spent acquainting himself
with the state of Michigan and the
corners of this campus, Schlissel
appears to understand this task
- and his leadership role as
University president - quite well.
He also has an undeniably strong
background as the former provost
of Brown University and dean of
biological sciences at the University
of California, Berkeley. All of this
combined in his speech to justify
the loftiness of the occasion and its
accompanying atmosphere.
And what an atmosphere it was.
Even considering the event's impor-
tance to the
University, the
amount of pomp
and circum- Schlis

ing it was almost
absurd. Dozens and convi

leaders from

higher educa-
tion institutions
paraded around the acoustically
perfect Hill Auditorium in full com-
mencement gear at the beginning of
the event. As they took their seats, a
University representative took great
care in placing the University's cere-
monialmaceon a101-year-oldlectern
while the organist (the organist?)
brought his fourth and final piece to
a close. Speakers rhapsodized about
the richness of the University's his-
tory, with past presidents such as
Angell and Mary Sue Coleman held
up as nearly equal in importance to
some of the great American leaders
of the past century.
Truly, though, many of these
leaders are University graduates.
They and their University affilia-
tion are vital parts of the institu-
tion's history and image, and it's
appropriate to invoke their achieve-
ments at an event like last Friday's.

Most importantly, a good number
of students aspire to similar promi-
nence and to see their names on
buildings, academic programs and
school awards alongside the likes of
real estate mogul Stephen Ross, U.S.
President Gerald Ford and Dorothy
McGuigan, a former University pro-
fessor and distinguished feminist.
But the fates of these great men
and women are not for every gradu-
ate of this university - and that is
OK. Many will go into their fields
and conduct essential, world-chang-
ing work that will never attain the
public prominence and wealth this
school loves to display on campus
and in the public sphere. It would be

of time would
begin to alienate those students who
don't aspire to attain great fame or
fabulous riches. Carried out over an
entire presidential term, this would
be disastrous for the University and
for society in general.
Due to his prior experiences as
an educator and self-proclaimed
lifelong student, Schlissel hasn't
fallen into that trap. From his words
and actions so far, I have high hopes
that he never will. But to live up to
Angell's vision and ensure that the
University diffuses dynamic, well-
educated men and women across all
ZIP codes and into families of every
socioeconomic status, Schlissel must
prioritize that vision for the full
course of his tenure and convince
those beneath himto do the same.

we may even miss the beauty of
summer turning to fall.
Technology is becoming less
of a commodity and more of a tool
used to isolate humans from their
environment.
Back in April, I was inspired
to make a change in my life after
watching a video called "Look Up,"
which has more than 46 million
views on YouTube.
The premise of the video, written
and directed by Gary'Tuirk,' is thif
we search for ways to connect
with each other, but instead end
up spending more time alone as
we cling to technology. Rather
than enjoying the sunset, we must

Instagram it; while we're physically
with two friends, we're virtually
with 600.
Turk then tells a love story,
in which a man finds and asks a
woman for directions. The confron-
tation initiates a friendship, which
then leads to a first date, marriage
later on and ultimately a life togeth-
er with children and
grandchildren. It's love
at first sight, but Turk
reintroduces the situa-
tion with the man using
an app on his phone to
find his destination. As
a result, the two would-
RIPPLE be lovers never glance at
Roundup each other.
or The moral of the story
isn't "Don't use your
phone or you'll never find true love."
Rather, it's an example of how the
butterfly effect - how small chang-
es have larger implications - may
affect our path in life. Turk's solu-
tion to counteracting this effect:
"Look up from your phone, and shut
down the display. Take in your sur-
roundings, make the most of today."
It's an important takeaway
that people can easily forget, and
something we should try our best
to be mindful of on a day-to-day
basis. So as I became fixated on my
iPhone in economics last Thursday,
I thought back to Turk's video and
promptly hit the lock button..
This isn't meant to be a cynical
view about the dangers technology
poses to basic human interaction.
We're at the point in society where
technology is a necessary tool, but
we must learn which times call for
its absolute necessity.
College is said to be the best
time of your life. It's where you can
find a passion and stick to it; where
you'll make friends you'll have for
the rest of your life; where you'll
have a professor who changes your
perspective on life; and where you
grow as an individual.
Why waste that time on a
cellphone nra laptop?
As Ferris Bueller said, "Life
moves pretty fast. If you don't stop
and look around once in a while,you
could miss it."
So remember to look up.

getting you down? Then soak
up the sun while you can. If you
want to take advantage of the
roughly two remaining weeks of
summer warmth, here are a few
things to do before students are
stuck in coats for the rest of the
school year.
RELAX ON THE DIAG
The Diag is one of the most
beautiful spots on campus when
it's in full bloom. There will be
many opportunities this winter
to hole up in the UGLi, so instead
spend some time between class
laying out in the shade and catch

location for group meetings.
BUILD A SLIP 'N SLIDE
This is your last (and quite
possibly only) chance to show
off your bathing suit while on
campus. Find some friends,
a tarp and a hose to create a
makeshift slip 'n slide. This may
be the most fun thing you could
do with a large piece of plastic.
KAYAK IN THE ARB
The beginning of the school
year is a great time to kayak in
the Huron River. Many groups,
like Outdoor Adventures, have
kayaking trips available to
students. You could also grab
some friends and rent your own
kayaks. Argo Canoe Livery and
'ln^"i U- " - rn -n-^^ ixmr ^nf ^-

do whi le
s still warm
river trips down the Huron River.
SPORTS AT PALMER
Before Palmer Field is covered
in snow, it's a great location for
any outdoor activity. Students
can play soccer or Frisbee on the
field, lounge on the hill or utilize
the tennis courts before the nets
are taken down.
EAT ICE CREAM
While this is not something
youstop doingwhenitgetscolder,
warm weather is ice cream's best
companion. There are many ice
cream and frozen yogurt places
near campus including Ben and
Jerry's, Stucchi's and Amer's.

Obama orders first airstrikes
in Syria to combat ISIS

President to
dispatch nearly 500
personnel to advise
Iraqi armed forces
WASHINGTON (AP) - Opening
a new military front in the Middle
East, President Barack Obama
authorized U.S. airstrikes inside
Syria for the first time Wednesday
night, along with expanded strikes
in Iraq as part of "a steady, relent-
less effort" to root out Islamic State
extremists and their spreading
reign of terror.
"We will hunt down terrorists
who threaten our country, wher-
ever they are," Obama declared in
a prime-time address to the nation
from the White House. "This is a
core principle of my presidency: If
you threaten America, you will find
no safe haven."
Obama announced that he was
dispatching nearly 500 more U.S.
troops to advise and assist Iraqi
security forces, as well as conduct
intelligence and reconnaissance
flights, bringing the total num-
ber of American forces sent there
this summer to more than 1,500.
He also urged Congress anew to
authorize a program to train and
arm Syrian rebels who are fight-
ing both the Islamic State mili-
tants and Syrian President Bashar
Assad.
Obama's plans amounted to a
striking shift for a president who
rose to political prominence in part
because of his early opposition to
the Iraq war. While in office, he has
steadfastly sought to wind down
American military campaigns in
the Middle East and avoid new wars
- particularly in Syria, a country
where the chaos of an intractable
civilwarhasgiventheIslamic State
space to thrive and move freely
across the border with Iraq.

Speaking on the eve of the
anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks, Obama's planswere also an
admission that years of American-
led war in the Middle East have not
quelled the terror threat emanating
from the region.
Obama insisted that his plan to
"degrade and ultimately destroy"
the Islamic State militants would
not involve returning U.S. combat
troops to the Middle East. Even so,
he acknowledged that "any time we
take military action, there are risks
involved, especially to the service-
men and women who carry out
these missions."
"But Iwant the American people
to understand how this effort will
be different from the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan. It will not involve
American combat troops fighting
on foreign soil," he added.
The president's speech, which
lasted about 15 minutes, followed
a summer of deliberation at the
White House over how to respond
to the violent Islamic State mili-
tants. While administration offi-
cials have said they are not aware
of a credible threat of a potential
attack by the militants in the U.S.,
they say the group poses risks to
Americans and interests across
the Middle East. Officials are also
concerned about the prospect that
Westerners, including Americans,
who have joined the militantgroup
could return to their home coun-
tries to launch attacks.
In recent weeks, the militants
have released videos depicting the
beheading of two American jour-
nalists in Syria. The violent images
appear to have had an impact on a
formerly war-weary public, with
multiple polls in recent days show-
ing that the majority of Americans
support airstrikes in both Iraq and
Syria.
The U.S. began launching lim-
ited airstrikes against Islamic State
targets in Iraq earlier this summer

at the request of that country's for-
mer prime minister. But Obama
vowed that he would not com-
mit the U.S. to a deeper military
campaign until Iraq formed a new
government that allowed greater
participation from all sects, a step
Iraqi leaders took Tuesday.
Officials said Obama plans to
proceed with both the broader air-
strikes in Iraq and the strikes in
Syria without seeking new authori-
zation from Congress. Instead, he is
to act under a use-of-force authori-
zation Congress passed in the days
after 9/11 to give President George
W. Bush the ability to go after those
who perpetrated the terror attacks.
Obama has previously called for
that authorization to be repealed,
but he has also used it as support
for strikes against terror targets in
Yemen and Somalia.
Obama said his approach in
Syria is modeled after those long-
running U.S. counterterrorism
campaigns. But it is different in
important ways, starting with the
fact that it marksthe first time since
9/11 that a U.S. president has autho-
rized the bombing of terror targets
in another nation without seeking
permission or at least notifying it in
advance.
House Speaker John Boehner,
R-Ohio, praised Obama for
acknowledging the "grave and
growing threat" 'that Islamic
extremists pose, but he said Obama
was coming to that conclusion far
too late.
"He has finally begun to make
the case the nation has needed him
to make for quite some time: that
destroying this terrorist threat
requires decisive action and must
be the highest priority for the Unit-
ed States and other nations of the
free world," Boehner said.
As if to answer the criticism that
he has been too cautious, Obama
declared of his plan: "This is Ameri-
can leadership at its best."

Why September
matters

ARIST AVANT GARDE

was still in high school
and it was a few days after
Christmas. I dragged my
loot of presents into the house
and began sorting through them,
analyzing
and mak-
ing mental
notes of who
stuck to my
color coded
Christmas
list and who
made the bold ERIKA
decision to HARWOOD
go off script.
My dad men-
tionedthatthere was one gift that
he forgot to give me, presumably
because he ordered it on Christ-
mas Eve and it just arrived. Then,
with absolutely zero enthusiasm
or feigned holiday joy, my dad
tossed me an unwrapped DVD.
I shrieked and gasped and
did everything in my power not
to pee all over my fleece pajama
bottoms.
"Do you want to watch it right
now?" I asked my dad, knowing
the answer would be something
along the lines of an eye roll,
forced chuckle and then a very
frank "no."
"No," he responded after fol-
lowingthe order of motions listed
above.
"Dad, this is 'The September
Issue'," I stressed. "That's the
most important issue and now I'll
have inside information on it."
He didn't care and I was only
slightly offended, soI went
downstairs and watched it, kick-
ing myself for not owning 2007's
issue with Sienna Miller on the
cover and Vogue's biggest issue
at that point with 840 pages of
glossy ads and Grace Codding-
ton-styled features.
Fast forward to 2014 and
I've probably watched "The

September Issue" 30 times. The
R.J. Cutler documentary isn't
as gritty and revealing as it was
expected to be in 2007. Anna
Wintour didn't come off as the
"ice queen" she's been painted as
over the years and Vogue didn't
seem as "The Devil Wears Prada"
as we all probably expected. And
as with all documentaries, there's
the question of whether or not
everythingshown is amatter
of Conde Nast'sbottom line or
actual authenticity.
I don't really care. Cutler still
gives one of the most in-depth
looks into the cities, personalities
and clothes that go into crafting
the 800+ pages of the year's most
important magazine.
I anticipate September every
year mostly (possibly only)
because of the issue's release.
After I get a copy, I bring it
around with me for about a week,
slowly turning the pages, exam-
ining every ad, reading every
article, weeping until my eyes dry
out after it's all over. Not really,
but I'm definitely not above cry-
ing about a magazine with Anna
Wintour's seal of approval.
With every year there seems
to be a new crop of family or
friends who ask me why I make
such a big deal out of it and why
it's thicker than most of our text-
books. I usually act over-the-top
annoyed and say "It's the Sep-
tember issue" and leave it at that.
Because to fully answer those
questions would take me a long
time and a lot of retelling of anec-
dotes like the one that opened
this column.
Of course, there is one rela-
tively easy and straightforward
answer. September is the begin-
ning of fall, which marks a time
of sartorial change. Back before
the days of the internet and
smartphones and everything my

mom still doesn'tunderstand,
this was the issue that debuted
the fall collections that were
showcased during spring fashion
week, and that was some excit-
ing shit.
Today, we can watch runway
shows in real time because
technology is a mysterious and
cunning dame that we will
never master, so the issue's task
of displaying these collections
is less of a surprise and more
of a refresher. Despite the
change, people still love the
September issue. Vogue's
issues keep getting bigger and
bigger, showing off designer's
most beautiful campaigns and
include unexpected articles like
"Cooking With Marijuana."
It's not just Vogue that pulls
out all its stops for this month.
Every fashion magazine from
Elle to Lucky views September
as its most valuable issue. That
said, few push themselves as hard
and claim as much dominance
as Vogue, which in part can be
accredited to the nostalgia factor.
The magazine has always
sought to create some sort of
spectacle, something to separate
it from the rest and establish
itself as the leader of fashion
editorial with its September
issues. Because of that, we're
left with hundreds of pages that
will eventually double as prized
possessions for those of us who
squeal every time a picture of the
cover is released weeks before
the pages themselves hits news-
stands. Whenever I feel as though
the world of fashion has become
stale or I find myself losing inter-
est, it's this issue, every year, that
reels me back in.
Harwood is crying over
Anna Wintour. To stop her,

OnineArts Editor
For Art & Design senior Nick
Tilma, inspiration comes from
seeing the beauty in the objects
liningthestreetsandhangingfrom
the sides of buildings; the ones that
most of us pass by every day with
little more than a casual glance.
"I've always been fascinated
with the urban landscape, and just
these things in parking lots, and
weird things that come up ... even
that sort of block at the end of a
parking space," Tilma said. "Just
howheavyit is and how permanent
it is."
While Tilma is currently using
his appreciation for form to work
toward a BFA with a concentration
in Product Design, his interest in
the aesthetic qualities of everyday
objects grew out, of a game that
he and his father played to pass
the time while driving around the
streets of Grand Rapids.
"My dad and I used to just
drive around, running errands or
whatever, and one day we were just
like 'Let's start a list and name all
of the different cars wesee,"'Tilma
said."So,while doing that, Istarted
really studying the shapes of the
cars and drawing them, studying
car design."
As Tilma explained, his studies
of car design gradually grew
into a broader study of form and
function.
"Fundamentally, it was just
understanding form. You know,
studying every detail of the car
and understanding how the
lights work, how the different
shapes come together in three
dimensions."
Tilma transferred to the
University three years ago after a
year at Kendall College of Art and
Design in Grand Rapids. During
his time here, he has assembled
a portfolio of minimalist pieces
that crystallize the strange
beauty of everyday objects into an
exploration of the intersection of
form and function.
For his senior thesis, which

q

NICHOLAS WILLIAMS/Daily
Nick Tilma holds one of his concrete lamps.

will be presented in an exposition
this comingspring, Tilma decided
to expand on that exploration
with a series of lamps made of
fiuorescent tubes set into concrete
in a variety of geometric shapes. A
pyramidal lamp reminiscent of an
M. C. Escher staircase sat on the
desk in his studio as he described
his vision for the project.
"(The concrete) is going to last
forever, which is kind of scary to
think about," Tilma said. "And
then the idea of contrasting that
with this glass tube was another
sort of play within the object
itself. It's actually set in the
concrete - you can't replace it. So
it's a kind of commentary or just
playing around with the ideas of
permanence and fragility."
At the same time, Tilma is cog-
nizant of the fact that his pieces
are, above all, functional objects.
"So it's like a product - it's a
lamp, you can look at it, it's not
super bright - but it's also ... there
is a concept behind it. I don't want
to push that, at the end of the day
I just want someone to view it as
a beautiful object, but there are

those underlying ideas."
In the future, he sees himself
working as a product designer
either on a freelance basis or as
part of a larger consulting firm.
That type of commercial work, he
explained, is, in a way, easier than
the sort of work he's currently
doing for his thesis.
"There is a kind of joy in
(designing products for a
company) because designers
love working with constraints.
The more constraints the easier
it is for us because there are less
unknownfactors."
But he certainly doesn't see
himself giving up the creative
outlet that more personal projects
like his lamp series provide. For a
person like Tilma, who constantly
looks at the world through an aes-
thetic lens, it's impossible not to
find something for inspiration.
"I'm a super observant person
. I'm always seeing my whole
environment,"he said."I find allof
these interesting-looking ... I call
them 'unintentional sculptures.'
You'd be really surprised if you
just look around."

No Wi-Fi?
Give, art a try

Appreciating the finer
things in (an Internet-
dominated) life
ByALEXBERNARD
DailyArts Writer
It didn't happen all at once.
It was a process. First, my
phone's reception dropped from
MWireless to "4G" and finally
to "E," whatever that means.
Texting slowed down, then
stopped altogether. Spotify
"couldn't be played without a
connection." The TV turned on,
but is it really TV when the only
channel is a little blue box that
says, "Signal Lost"?
What remained was
desolation. Nothing but our
poorly stocked fridge and five-
dollar fans to keep us company.
The humidity in the apartment
rose to an intolerable level. It
was as though the walls had
collapsed (which just made us
want to go on YouTube and look
up the trash compactor scene
from "Star Wars." We could not.).
We had no Internet. It was yet
to be installed. What could we
do?
We tried everything. We
purchased a football. My
roommate bought seven fish.
I hummed lightly to myself,
hugged my knees to my chest and
rocked from side to side. Nothing
worked. What had occurred was
the systematic dissolution of our
connection to the outside world
and, ultimately, to each other.
How were we to interact if not
by Snapchats sent from the other
side of the couch?
I found myself bereft of energy
just days before the beginning of
classes. Instinctively, I collapsed
onto my unmade bed and gazed
blankly out at-what some have
called - a "bookcase." My eyes
fell upon the spines. The letters
were there next to each other, but
they wouldn't form words.
What were these strange,
colorful packages and why were
they in my room? What did they
want?
I suddenly had a powerful urge
to look up these questions on
SparkNotes, was met again and
again with "NO CONNECTION
FOUND" until, out of furious
impulse, I hurled one of these
English language puzzles across
the room, nearly striking the
powerless TV.
The book fell on its back and
flipped open. There they were,
lines and lines of text, filling
each page from front to. back.
It's like SparkNotes, I thought,
only longer and more detailed!
My professors aren't going to
know what hit 'em!
I lifted the book to my eyes
and read "The Devil in the
White City" by Erik Larson, a
haunting piece of nonfiction
about the mystery, murder and
mania surrounding the Chicago
World's Fair. I laughed. I cried. I
hid under my ex-girlfriend's old
blanket.
The book ended. I sat. I
stared. I shouted, "What is life!"
I wanted more. Give me more,
Larson!
Or better yet, I'd do it myself.
I sat down to my disconnected
laptop and opened the only
program still accessible in

my Internet-less wasteland:
Microsoft Word. The letters that
had before seemed so disjointed
and isolated from one another
stuffed myvblank document with

blocky black text.
A boy named Willem leaped
over an old cart. A girl named
Arianna learned to paint. A
cat talked. A farmer flew. An
elephant read the morning
paper while riding a unicycle
made of anchovies.
The night wore on, squeezing
the words from my brain like
dirty water from a sponge. I
needed more than .my own
choppy stories though, but
where to find it?
My feet clamored up to me.
"Walk!" they demanded. "Stop
propping us up on your faux-
wooden desk and walk!" So I
did. The feet carried me into
downtown Ann Arbor where
a movie theater sign screamed
out in all capital letters:
"BOYHOOD."
For the next three hours, I
sat in The Michigan Theater's
screening room, crossed my
legs, drank a Coke and watched
an epic cinematic achievement
destined to influence
filmmakers, critics and biblical
interpretations for centuries to
come. It was all right.
Not once during the film's
duration did I realize I had
a Wi-Fi connection and,
consequently a Snapchat of
noodles.
When I left later that night,
that same unsatisfied feeling
returned to the pit of my
stomach, the same one you get
after eating dining hall tater
tots. But suddenly, there was
purpose. There was more to see,
more to do. There was more to
it than that little blinking circle
that tells you your Facebook is
loading. There was color.
I checked my phone, saw
the "4G" in the corner, and
promptly used up my parents'
data package looking up Ann
Arbor's art scene.
For once, I was blind, but now
I see!

The Yourist Studio Gallery is
outoftheway.Tuckedintoasmall
space on Broadway Street, on the
way to an alienated North
Campus, everything about the
location suggests seclusion.
The liquor store next door.
A small parking lot littered
with a few SUVs. A cracked
sidewalk, veined in weeds.
And a layer of dust, wafting
from the nearby construction
work, covering everything
else. Until one walks through
the front doors, nothing
about the facility suggests
it could be thriving creative
workspace in the middle of a
liberal college town.
But the studio-gallery
has been surviving for close
to 40 years - founded in
the late 1970s by owner and
resident artist Kay Yourist,
the facility was originally
established as a place where
Yourist could continue
developing her work. As
years passed, the small studio
grew with Yourist's brand,
eventually hosting classes
for developing professional
and student artists. Though
one fact remained constant:
Ever since its inception,
the studio has been solely
dedicated to ceramics. Every
piece displayed in the gallery,
situated toward the front
of the facility, is clay-based
and every one of the classes
Yourist or her employees offer,
from beginner to advanced,
is dedicated to perfecting
clayworking.
"I've just always been
drawn to clay," Yourist said.
"There's something really
special about being able to
hold a piece in your hands
after having molded it from
start to finish."
On her website, Yourist
further describes that
molding process.
"I begin my artistic
process by throwing the clay
into classic vessels that are
as recognizable today as a
thousand years ago," Yourist
wrote. "I then alter their form
by pushing and pulling and
stretching the walls of the
pot. When the clay dries to
a leather hard consistency, I
carve into the walls to give the
piece surface relief detail and
texture. The last step involves
coating the completed forms
with copper and iron rich
glazes, chosen to emphasize
the organic and timeless
nature of clay."
The entire methodology
culminates in a final product
that attempts to bridge a time
gap between past and present
- classic, traditional pottery-
making furnished with her
own uniquely contemporary
style, glazed in highly metallic
format. The art that Yourist
produces is often sold at the
Ann Arbor Art Fair but is also
showcased in her own gallery,
where she displays pieces
made by the other artists
working in her studio.
"I've been really fortunate
in having had the opportunity

to develop this passion for
ceramics," Yourist said. "But
I think what's even more
rewarding is that I was able to
learn how to run a business."
That business now allows
Yourist to host community
artists in her studio space,
where, for a fee, they can take
advantage of her equipment
to produce their own pieces.
Usually, the community
artists working with Yourist
are people who have taken
classes with her in the past,
and in many cases, for years or
even decades.
Marilyn Edington, one
of the community artists
who regularly works at the
Yourist Studio, first became
interested in pursuing
ceramics as a side career
after enrolling in a beginner
class under Yourist's tutelage.
After years working as a
statistician at the University
of Michigan Health System,
Edington decided she needed
to flex her creativity after
retiring. She described how,
in her first beginner class, she
was immediately given that
chance to use her hands as she
continued working with clay.
"Kay suggested I continue
taking classes because it was
clear I was getting a lot out
of them," Edington said. "So I
kept coming back and I fell in
love with clay."
"There are just so many
nuances with this medium,"
she said. "It's more than just

urist struggled to "I was always encouraged

to pursue art," Bowden said.
"And I guess I always just
gravitated toward expressing
myself creatively. I studied art
in college and after moving to
Ann Arbor, I decided to create
a space for myself pretty
soon."
Over the decades, the
Yourist Studio Gallery has
oscillated between periods
of profit and success, but has
flourished in the last few
years. Yourist hopes to use the
developing business in order
to launch an online version of
the gallery that can reach new
customers.
In addition, she has been
trying to reach out to college
students who she feels can
benefit from the freedom
claywork offers.
"I've had students,
engineering majors come in
who absolutely blew me away
with the type of work they
were able to produce," she
said. "I think a lot of college-
age kids don't realize the ways
in which this art can help you
calin your nerves and be at
peace."
Through another recently
launched program, she
rents out her studio space
to small parties who, under
supervision, can work with
ceramics while celebrating
a special occasion. Which
means, yes, alcohol-infused
nights around a pottery wheel.
"We haven't had anything
inappropriate happen," she
said, laughing. "We're just
hoping to find a place for
ceramics in the future. Because
it really is something that we
all should experience at least
once in our lives."

hard as she can, before taking
an open seat right next to where
the band is playing and letting
them jam. When she introduces
and explains the songs, most of
them seem to be about falling in
love, out of love or both, but an
exception here is "Beat Ohio."
The track on Heartspace
Timepiece with the most clearly
Ann Arbor-inspired name, "Beat
Ohio" is also one of the new
record's highlights. The song
opens the show and also gets a
reprise in the second set, before
which O'Leary explains that
it's about "never being able to
be from here." Syrupy sweet,
O'Leary's vocals sing-song over
aguitarthat's essentiallysoloing
for the entire song. Mandolin,
piano and the mellow trot of the
drums join in as O'Leary seems
to criticize someone who'd
rather be from the East than the
Midwest, telling him "you're
doing it wrong."
This night at Crazy Wisdom is
bittersweet for O'Leary, Church
and the band. "This is closing
the book on a chapter tonight,"
Church says. He's been really
busy with the band and his fap-
ily, but is finishing up a solo
project that he's been wanting to
do for a long time. Sindelar and
Martin Maginity, The Cham-
pions' drummer, are also play-
ing together in a separate band
called The Landmarks. Most
dramatically, though, O'Leary
now lives in North Carolina.
But they remain confident that
they'll continue to work togeth-
er, once the timing gets better.
In explaining the album's
name, O'Leary says Timepiece
comes from the fact that the
year in which the record was
made was seared into the band's
brain, and the album is "a
document of a very specific time
in our lives." Heartspace, she
says, "comes from whenwe were
talking about being stressed out
by personal tragedy, and how
we didn't have the headspace
to think about music sometimes
and how sad that was for us,
and I was like, 'It's not even our
headspace, it's heartspace.' Our
heartspace is not big enough
to encompass all this tragedy."
However, now that the band
has lived through the tragedy,
O'Leary says "I will never undo
the pain of that time, but I feel
triumphant."

Poignant lyrics

Daily Music Editor
To open her second set,
Alejandra O'Leary decides to
performacoversongwithouther
band. Wearing a denim jacket
over a farmers market t-shirt
and jeans, she sits on a stool
with her acoustic guitar as the
packed-in coffeehouse crowd
watches her play a stripped-
down cover of the normally
bombastic, over-the-top "No
Surrender," a Bruce Springsteen
song whose words, O'Leary

says, "perfectly express how I
feel about this band." With all of
the attention focused on her, she
sings, "We made a promise we
swore we'd always remember.
No retreat, no surrender."
This show on the upstairs
level of Crazy Wisdom, a spiri-
tual bookstore on Main Street, is
a homecoming for O'Leary. Less
than a week after the release
of her new album, Heartspace
Timepiece, she's already staring
down a new chapter of her life.
But the Crazy Wisdom show
allows her to bring together
everyone who played on the
record, to celebrate the fact that
they've all made it through diffi-
cult times to produce the fantas-
tic finished product. "It's like the
butterfly that lives for one day,"

O'Leary says. She and her band,
The Champions of the West,
only rehearsed three times for
the nearly two-hour show, but
aside from occasional feedback
from the amps (probably more
the fault of the unconventional
venue than the band), the group
sounds tight, mostly playing an
old-school style of rock 'n' roll,
with odder instruments like the
mandolin mixed in. The fact
that Mich Rickman plays his bass
upright on some songs is indica-
tive of the classic authenticity
of the band's aesthetic. Led by
O'Leary and guitarist Jamie
Church, The Champions com-
municate well and never step on
each other's musical toes. Their
love for music and playing in the
band shines through.

While promising themes -
the ethical issues of providing
headline-grabbing news and
the intoxicating nature of suc-

point of the film, the trailer
itself is poorly constructed. A
clumsy montage of clips dilutes
the tension with unnecessary
comedy and even the lip-sync
is way off in some places. Still,
the trailer makes it look like a

clip, it'slike the New York of
