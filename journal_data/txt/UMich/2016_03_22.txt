‘U’ researchers use 
mice in experiment 
on element’s effect 

on weight 

By KEVIN BIGLIN 

For the Daily

The long-term effects of lead 

exposure at young ages could 
increase the risk of obesity later 
in life, a University of Michigan 
School of Public Health study 
found. 
The 
study 
— 
which 

researchers noted shows a possible 
life-long impact in the state for 
Flint residents in particular, due 
to the cities water crisis — was a 
controlled experiment performed 
on young mice from 2012 to 2014 
that considered the impacts of lead 
on the mice’s weight.

The study was performed by 

Dana Dolinoy, associate professor 
of environmental health sciences, 
along with Chuanwu Xi, associate 
professor of environmental health 
science.

The mice used in the study 

were the offspring of female mice 
who were exposed to lead before 
breeding, Dolinoy said in an 
interview. The female mice were 
exposed to lead for a three-week 
period of gestation and another 
three-week period of lactation 
after birth. Then for nine months, 
the 
newborn 
mice 
matured 

without further lead exposure, 
while 
their 
weight 
and 
gut 

microbiome compositions were 
measured. 

Unlike other similar studies 

about the effects of lead, Xi said 
this study focuses on the long-

term effects of short-term lead 
exposure.

“It is not immediate,” he said. 

“We are particularly interested in 
the long-life effects.”

Xi added that the team was 

able to show that lead exposure 
changes 
the 
composition 
of 

bacteria in the gut microbiome. 
Specifically, the ratio of anaerobes, 
bacteria that can grow without 
oxygen, to aerobes, bacteria that 
grow with oxygen, indicated links 
to obesity in both male and female 
mice because of the ratio was at 
levels corerlated with obesity. In 
the experiment, these microbe 
populations each have specific 
groups where some populations 
of anaerobic bacteria increased, 
and others of aerobic bacteria 
decreased 
since 
the 
oxygen 

concentration became limited due 
to lead exposure.

Though both female and male 

microbiota changed, only male 
mice were found to have body-
weight gain.

“The composition of the gut 

microbiome is quite complex,” 
Xi said. “So what we found is, we 
don’t really see a dramatic change 
in terms of complexity of the gut 
microbiome. But what we see is 
that the abundance of specific 
microbe 
populations 
change. 

That’s clearly demonstrating you 
have a changing gut microbiome.”

The study used a range of lead 

levels on mice, including a level 
higher than the current levels to 
simulate historic levels from the 
1960s and 1970s, Dolinoy said. 
Xi added that this is because the 
concentration of lead from the past 
can still be found today in paint 
and old lead pipes, such as those

Daily Staff Reporters 

A team of University of 

Michigan alumni and athletes 
are bringing back the iconic 
restaurant Pretzel Bell back to 
Ann Arbor.

Open from 1934 to 1984, the 

original Pretzel Bell served 
as a city hotspot for students, 
faculty 
and 
community 

members 
to 
celebrate 

birthdays, spend game days 
and enjoy time with friends, 
Greg Lobdell, owner of the 
new restaurant, said. It’s new 
location on Main Street will 
open on April 14.

“The spirit of this place was 

really celebrating everything 
that is good about Ann Arbor 
and everything that is great 
about 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan,” Lobdell said at a 
walk-through of the restaraunt 
on Monday, which is currently 
under construction. “We 
thought, ‘Let’s create a new 
place that has those traditions 
that will live on.’ ”

Jon Carlson and Lobdell, 

two of the restaurant’s nine 
owners, joined a team of 
former University of Michigan 
athletes 
and 
University 

alumni, who they said had 
great memories at the Pretzel 
Bell and are invested in 
bringing it back to Ann Arbor, 
for a restaurant walk-through.

“Traditionally 
we 
have 

three or four partners at each 
restaurant,” Carlson said. “For 
this one we formed a team. We 
thought that was important. If 
we’re going to represent what 
the University meant to us, we 
can’t do it from two guys who 

were here from ‘89 to ‘93. So 
we have a team of 22 investors, 
some of them fairly prominent 
either athletes, or business 
people in the United States.”

Steve 
Seyferth, 
one 
of 

the 
restaurant’s 
investors, 

graduated from the University 
in 1977. He said because his 
brother played football for 
the University, he quickly 
discovered 
that 
Pretzel 

Bell was a popular place on 
campus.

“When I came out here 

from Connecticut to watch 
my brother play, the place to 
go was the Pretzel Bell,” he 
said. “We quickly learned 
that you can get a great 
environment, great ambiance, 
great tradition. It made you 
feel like you were part of the 
whole Michigan athletic scene 
as well as just the downtown 
flavor of Ann Arbor at the 
time.”

newMICH — a Central Student 

Government 
party 
running 

against Your Michigan and the 
Defend Affirmative Action Party 
in the upcoming election — held 
a speak out in the Diag to spread 
awareness 
about 
the 
party 

Monday. 

newMICH co-chair Shamaila 

Ashraf, an LSA junior, said the 
speak out aimed provide an 
opportunity for University of 
Michigan students to talk to the 
representatives about what they 
wished to see in CSG next year.

“A couple of our main initiatives 

is putting the student voice back 
into 
the 
administration 
and 

University in total,” Ashraf said. 
“Another thing we want to do is 
connect the students back to CSG 
and offer them scholarships.”

Representatives spoke about 

various topics during the speak 
out, including increasing funding 
for mental health facilities and 
hydration stations during game 
days. Speakers also emphasized 
they are the only party advocating 
for a student representative on 
the Board of Regents.

newMICH campaign manager 

Anushka 
Sarkar, 
an 
LSA 

sophomore, said the speak out 
was meant to give students a fun 
setting to personally connect 
with CSG representatives.

The 2016 Central Student 

Government 
elections 
are 

March 
23 
and 
24. 
Here’s 

everything you need to know 
about the three parties running 
for executive offices. 

Party: Defend Affirmative 

Action Party

Who: LSA junior Keysha Wall 
and LSA sophomore Chalse 
Okorom
Platform: LSA junior Keysha 
Wall 
and 
LSA 
sophomore 

Chalse Okorom are running 
on DAAP’s executive ticket for 
president and vice president, 
respectively. The party hasn’t 
released a platform for the 2016 

elections; however, much of the 
DAAP platform fromprevious 
years applies to the group’s 
current mission. In a recent 
debate hosted by The Michigan 
Daily, the candidates stressed 
the 
need 
for 
increasing 

minority enrollment at the 
University, pointing to the 
Texas 10-percent rule, which 
guarantees students in Texas 
high schools who graduated in 
the top 10 percent of their class 
admission to state universities. 
They have also proposed several 
other initiatives to increase 
diversity, equity and inclusion, 
such as removing standardized 
testing from the admissions 
process 
and 
expanding 

financial aid programs. The 
party also pushes for creating 
a safer, more inclusive campus 
atmosphere for all minority 
groups, 
including 
racial 

minorities and undocumented 
students, 
and 
has 
spoken 

about the need for greater 
accessibility to mental health 
resources.

Body also approves 
proposal to rezone 
land along Pontiac 

Trail

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter 

During 
their 
meeting 

Monday 
evening, 
the 
Ann 

Arbor City Council approved 

measures 
regarding 
new 

housing 
developments 
and 

improvements to Ann Arbor 
streets and sidewalks.

The Council approved a 

resolution to rezone 31.77 acres 
of land on Pontiac Trail from 
multiple-family dwellings to 
single-family 
and 
multiple-

family 
dwellings 
for 
the 

North Sky Development. This 
new housing development is 
one of three proposed large 
residential housing units in 

the area.

Though it passed, many 

Council members, such as 
Councilmember Jane Lumm 
(I–Ward 2), expressed concern 
over the potential impact on 
the area from a large influx of 
new residents

“If 
this 
were 
the 
only 

residential 
housing 

development 
proposed 

in northeast Ann Arbor I 
would not have any of the 
reservations and concerns I 

have,” Lumm said. “We are 
talking about almost 1,000 
new residential units in this 
area — let me pause when I 
say that — 1,000 units, that’s 
a huge amount of new traffic 
volume.”

Transportation 
was 
also 

a central theme during the 
evening’s 
Council 
meeting.

Nicholas Mirzoeff, professor of media, culture, and 
Communication at New York University, discusses the role 
protest performance has played in the #BlackLivesMatter 
movement in Angell Hall Monday. 

Central Student 

Government hopefuls are 
looking to members of the 
University of Michigan football 
team to help them gain student 
support ahead of campus-wide 
elections Wednesday and 
Thursday.

Both newMICH and Your 

Michigan have released video 
endorsements, from freshman 
safety Jabrill Peppers, a LSA 
sophomore, and junior tight 
end Jake Butt, a LSA junior, 
respectively. Each of their video 
endorsements have received 
more than 3,000 views from 
Facebook users. 

In his endorsement, Peppers 

echoed newMICH’s platform 
to reform CSG, and said he 
intended to vote for the party’s 
executive ticket —presidential 
candidate David Schafer and 
vice presidential candidate 
Micah Griggs, both LSA juniors 
— in the upcoming election.

During the campaign, 

Schafer and Griggs have 

stressed fostering a more 
inclusive environment on 
campus by creating a leadership 
scholarship for low-income 
students, increasing funding for 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services and the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness 
Center and putting a student 
on the University’ Board of 
Regents. 

“It’s time for a Central 

Student Government that is 
inclusive, representative and 
productive,” Peppers said.

In his endorsement, Butt 

had a similar message about 
Your Michigan, saying that the 
party represented student voice. 

Your Michigan has also 

heavily emphasizes increasing 
support for SAPAC, as well 
as improving mental health 
resources on campus. Led by 
Ford junior Thomas Hislop and 
LSA junior Cam Dotson — who 
are vying for president and vice 
president respectively — the 
party also has a slate of other 

initiatives, including creating a 
team of trained volunteers who 
will transport students from 
North to Central Campus who 
are in need of counseling from 
CAPS.

“This is your time, your 

voice, your Michigan,” Butt said.

The third party with an 

executive ticket, the Defend 
Affirmative Action Party, led by 
presidential candidate Keysha 
Wall, an LSA junior and vice 
presidential candidate Chalse 
Okorom, an LSA sophomore, 
have not announced an 
endorsement from a member of 
the football program. On their 
public Facebook group, DAAP 
states their platform is to double 
minority enrollment at the 
University and to build a new 
civil rights movement with the 
spirit of Ferguson.

The Michigan football team 

as a whole does not endorse any 
party vying for CSG executive 
office.

ROLE OF PROTESTS

Senate Assembly votes to add new members 
to SACUA to fill up to six open positions

Number of seats 

available still unclear 

for term-blind 

election

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The Senate Assembly voted 

on new members to replace up to 
six open positions on the Senate 
Advisory Committee on University 
Affairs at their meeting Monday.

The 10 nominees included 

Classical Studies Prof. Sara Ahbel-
Rappe, Engineering Prof. Michael 
Atzmon, Radiology Prof. Ruth 
Carlos, University of Michigan 
Librarian Beau Case, Kinesiology 
Prof. Weiyun Chen, Bob Fraser, 
UM-Dearborn 
Librarian, 

Medical School Prof. Paul Kileny, 
Chemistry 
Prof. 
Neil 
Marsh, 

Social Work Prof. Robert Ortega 
and Engineering Prof. Bill Schulz.

At the last Senate Assembly 

meeting, the assembly voted 
unanimously to hold a term-blind 
election, meaning the candidates 
would not be associated with the 
term length then want to have. 
Instead, nominees were ranked 

by number of votes received. The 
person who received the most 
votes will serve for the longest 
term they are willing to hold, at 
a maximum of three years. The 
next candidate with the most 
votes also got their choices, given 
there is an available position, and 
so on.

The candidates in order of 

most votes were Schulz, Atzman, 
Carlos, Marsh and Ortega tied 
for fourth, Fraser, Kileny, Ahbel-
Rappe, Case and Chen.

As of now, there are four slots 

open for candidates. However, 
SACUA 
Chair 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck and SACUA member 
Stefan 
Szymanski, 
Sports 

Management prof., may also be 
vacating their positions due to 
sabbaticals, so up to six positions 
may be available.

Because Marsh and Ortega are 

tied for fourth, this may lead to a 
runoff election at the next Senate 
Assembly, unless Weineck and 
Szymanski step down as well. If 
not, Marsh and Ortega will have to 
face off in a second vote.

Weineck said the assembly will 

know if another vote is needed at 
their next meeting on April 18.

The next steps for the nominees 

are to choose term lengths and 

fill the positions in order of votes 
received. This process will be 
completed when Weineck and 
Szymanski finalize each of their 
plans regarding their positions on 
the committee.

Before the vote took place, 

candidates 
discussed 
their 

platforms with many saying they 
felt the role of faculty governance 
on campus needed to be changed.

“We need to remind our 

administrators of our values,” 
Atzman said.

Third-place candidate Carlos 

echoed 
Atzman’s 
sentiments 

and said she did not feel that the 
University provides the faculty 
with 
enough 
power, 
instead 

leaving them in an explicitly 
advisory role.

“We do not have a strong 

tradition of centralized practice in 
the University,” Carlos said.

Marsh 
said 
he 
felt 

administrators 
treat 
faculty 

as employees and one of his 
initiatives on the committee would 
be to change this dynamic.

“More and more, there are 

administrators who see faculty as 
not being citizens of academy, as 
essentially being employees to be 
managed,” Marsh said.

Schulz, who currently serves on 

SACUA, said administration will 
not give SACUA what they want: 
more governing power.

“We have peers that have much 

stronger faculty governance than 
us and that’s not been a recent 
phenomenon,” Schulz said. “We’ve 
always been weak, we’ve been 
more advisory than a real player in 
shared governance.”

In addition to elections, Weineck 

also updated the Senate Assembly 
on 
the 
Faculty 
Governance 

conference that happened last 
week. The conference hosted 
faculty governances from across 
the country to discuss topics 
such as due process protections, 
Title IX, academic freedom and 
the role of faculty members in 
higher education. The conference 
also 
hosted 
Northwestern 

Communications 
Prof. 
Laura 

Kipnis, who delivered her lecture 
titled “Stupid Sex.”

Overall, 
Weineck 
said 

the conference shed light on 
weaknesses in the University’s 
current system.

“The University of Michigan has 

the weakest faculty governance 
system of any of the students we 
talked to,” Weineck said. “Our role 
is almost entirely advisory, with 
very few decision making powers.”

proposal to include a street 
and sidewalk millage on the 
upcoming August municipal 
election ballot.

Councilmember Chip Smith 

(D–Ward 5), a sponsor of the 
resolution, noted that the 
current millage for street and 
sidewalk expires in November, 
emphasizing the importance 
of continuing to fund road 
repairs.

“Also, I think it is worth 

noting how important the 
sidewalks millage component 
is — we put in over 22,000 
slabs of sidewalk since this was 
first passed by voters,” Smith 
said. “I think this is a really 
elemental tool to making our 
streets and sidewalks better 
— keeping them up to the 
standard we expect.”

Councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1) said she 
she thought it was crucial 
that the resolution appear 
on the August primary ballot 
as opposed to the November 
ballot. Though there will be 

a lot of people voting in the 
November 
election, 
Briere 

said the new implementation 
of straight-party voting in that 
election will mean a lengthy 
ballot that may overwhelm 
voters.

“August 
however 
is 
a 

primary,” Briere said. “It’s 
focused 
on 
local 
issues; 

there will be most likely 
other initiatives on the ballot 
that are also focus on local 
initiatives.”

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 
5) 

expressed 
some 
concerns 

over current restrictions on 
millage funds.

“I support the resolution as 

written because it will allow 
us if we so choose to have 
flexibility in terms of how the 
millage funds would be used,” 
Warpehoski said. “Right now 
it is difficult to use millage 
funds to address things like our 
ability to put in handicapable 
accessible 
ramps, 
improve 

crosswalks or fill sidewalk 
gaps — key features that all of 
our community use — and my 
hope is that when the millage 
is passed we will have some of 
that additional flexibility.”

Gov. Snyder calls 
for stricter lead 
standards for Flint

Gov. Rick Snyder released 

a plan on Monday, which will 
decrease the tolerance for lead 
in drinking water with a more 
stringent base level to trigger 
a response by regulators, the 
Detroit Free Press reports. 

The plan was released 

following criticism of the 
governor for his delayed response 
to the Flint water crisis. 

Snyder’s plan addresses issues 

ranging from children’s health 
to economic development. It 
also sets up both short-term 
and long-term goals for health, 
infrastructure, educational and 
economic development.

In a press release, Snyder said 

he is working on plans to support 
the residents of Flint into the 
future.

“These action plans lay out our 

next steps as we continue to work 
together as one Michigan to solve 
the challenges residents face,” he 
said.

The announcement of his 

plan follows Synder’s testimony 
before a congressional committee, 
where members of the committee 
accused him of negligence.

Heavy snowfall 
expected in Lansing, 
Grand Rapids

Large portions of Michigan 

are expected to experience 
several inches of snow 
Wednesday night and Thursday 
morning, according to the 
National Weather Service.

The storm will move in 

from the Great Plains and will 
cover the counties surrounding 
Lansing with up to six inches 
of snow. Areas farther north of 
Lansing could experience more 
than six inches. 

The snow could come in a 

mixed form of sleet and freezing 
rain. The National Weather 
Service additionaly issued a 
storm warning for Sunday, 
but the affected area does not 
include Ann Arbor. 

The Ann Arbor area is 

expected to miss the bulk of the 
snow and instead experience 
rain.

University physician 
honored as a top 
doctor in the U.S.

University physician and 

researcher Eva Feldman was 
honored as one of the nation’s 
top doctors in the 11th Annual 
National Physician of the Year 
Awards in New York, presented 
by the Castle Connolly Medical 
Ltd. 

Feldman is one of three 

recipients of the Clinical 
Excellence Award. The annual 
award honors doctors who 
pratice exemplary clinical 
medical practice. 

“It is such an honor to be 

recognized, but this is truly the 
result of tremendous teamwork,” 
Feldman said in a press release. 
“The University attracts such 
talented and dedicated people to 
serve our patients in every way, 
through brilliant staff, cutting-
edge research and world-class 
facilities. I feel deeply privileged 
to be a practicing clinical 
scientist at the University of 
Michigan.”

Feldman’s research team is 

overseeing trials for stem cell 
research in Lou Gehrig’s disease.

Feldman was named as the 

first director of the A. Alfred 
Taubman Medical Research 
Institute in January 2008. The 
institute was created to support 
research in diseases like adult 
and childhood cancer, ALS, 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease 
and hearing loss. 

Feldman has published 

325 original peer-reviewed 
articles, 60 book chapters 
and three books. She has 
previously recieved the 
University’s Distinguished 
Faculty Achievement Award and 
has been elected to the Johns 
Hopkins Society of Scholars.

NEWS BRIEFS

FYI: 
In 
last 
year’s 

platform, DAAP called for 
the restoration of affirmative 
action practices. It is important 
to note that affirmative action 
was deemed illegal in the 
state of Michigan following 
a statewide vote in favor 
of ballot measure Proposal 
2 in 2006, which bans the 
use of affirmative action in 
public college admissions in 
Michigan.

Party: newMICH

Who: 
LSA 
junior 
David 

Schafer and LSA junior Micah 
Griggs
Platform: 
On 
newMICH’s 

executive ticket is LSA junior 
David Schafer, running for 
president, and LSA junior 
Micah Griggs, running for 
vice president. The party’s 
platform emphasizes issues 
surrounding 
diversity, 

inclusion 
and 
student 

engagement. 
In 
terms 
of 

amplifying student voices, the 
party has urged for student 
presence on the Board of 
Regents 
and 
a 
semesterly 

meeting 
between 
regents 

and the University Council, 
a student governing board 
comprised 
of 
members 

from each degree program. 
Recently, the candidates have 
been stressing that a student 
regent would further several 
wellness initiatives, including 
the expansion of mental health 
resources and the addition of 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services staff members — 
a goal Your Michigan has 
publicly supported as well. 
The platform also proposes 
Q&A sessions with students, 
administrators, faculty, staff 
and the Division of Public 
Safety and Security. Both 
newMICH and Your Michigan 
have discussed the need for 
outreach to underrepresented 
communities such as Detroit, 
and newMICH expanded on 
this goal in their platform, 
calling 
for 
mandatory 

Intergroup 
Relations 
and 

identity training for Central 
Student 
Government 

Executive 
and 
Assembly 

members 
and 
in-state 

tuition 
for 
undocumented 

graduate students. Currently, 
undocumented 
students 

qualify for in-state tuition, 
typically if they attended and 
graduated from an American 
high school.
FYI: Schafer 
is 
currently 

an 
LSA 
representative 
on 

CSG and assists in the Office 
of 
Academic 
Multicultural 

Initiatives. Griggs is also an 
LSA student representative, 

and this year she was a member 
of the LSA Race and Ethnicity 
Review 
Committee, 
which 

was tasked with investigating 
the R&E requirement and 
making recommendations to 
improve it.

Also noticible is the debate 

surrounding 
the 
party’s 

initiative to add a student to 
the Board of Regents, as the 
creation of a voting position 
on the board for a student 
would require amending the 
state constitution. However, 
in an interview with the Daily, 
Schafer noted that a non-
voting position was also a 
possibility, saying that in that 
capacity, a student presence 
on the Board of Regents would 
be invaluable.

Party: Your Michigan

Who: Public Policy junior 
Thomas 
Hislop 
and 
LSA 

junior Cameron Dotson
Platform: Public Policy junior 
Thomas Hislop and LSA junior 
Cam Dotson are running on 
Your 
Michigan’s 
executive 

ticket for president and vice 
president, respectively. The 
party’s platform focuses on 
increasing the transparency 
of CSG and the inclusivity 
of the University Council, 
cultivating a strong sense of 
community 
across 
campus 

and making the University 
more 
accessible, 
beginning 

with incoming freshmen. Your 
Michigan’s 
five-step 
plan 

includes electing a freshman 
council delegate to the UC, 
updating 
meeting 
minutes 

regularly for UC, increasing 
collaboration between CSG 
and 
the 
UC, 
hosting 
UC 

meetings in different campus 
locations 
and 
allowing 
a 

diverse 
group 
of 
smaller 

student organizations to sit 
on the council. They’ve also 
highlighted plans aimed to 
create a more positive campus 
environment by uniting The 
Maize Rage and increasing 
school spirit — according to 
the party’s website, Hislop 
has already met with now-
former 
Interim 
Athletic 

Director Jim Hackett and the 
Athletics Department to begin 
discussing the initiative.
FYI: Hislop is an elected 
representative on CSG and 
currently serves as chairman 
of the Ethics Committee, and 
Dotson is a representative 
in CSG and a leader on the 
Student Renovations Advisory 
Committee, a group involved 
in 
the 
upcoming 
Union 

renovations that are expected 
to be completed in 2018. He 
has been vocal about ensuring 
that the renovated Union have 
more appropriate, extensive 
spaces for mental health and 
student organizations.

used to carry water in Flint.

“Lead is a historical problem,” 

Xi said citing severasl ways 
humans can be exposed to 
lead. “The other route (to lead 
exposure) is lead-contaminated 
pipes for drinking water, like 
Flint.”

Though a 10-percent average 

increase in body weight in 
adult male mice was recorded, 
when predicting human weight 
effects, Dolinoy said it gets 
more difficult since the mice 
experiment 
was 
controlled, 

whereas 
many 
factors 
can 

impact human health.

“Along with this mouse model 

we have different human cohorts 
where we study similar things,” 
Dolinoy said. “But as you can 
imagine, waiting for a human 
baby to grow up takes decades 
when we can answer similar 
questions in mice over just a few 
years.”

Xi 
emphasized 
that 
this 

study, though revealing new 
information, should be seen 
only as a risk, not a concrete 
outcomes. 

Speaking to ways to avoid 

weight gain, Xi said the weight 
gained 
from 
lead 
exposure 

can be controlled or reversed. 
Referencing 
the 
heightened 

levels of lead found in Flint water 
in 2015, Xi suggested those 
exposed to lead adopt a lifestyle 
of eating healthy and exercising. 
Dolinoy added that a having a 

strong social network of family 
and friends helps too.

“They (the children of Flint) 

have the long-lasting effects,” 
Xi said. “You need to pay more 
attention to your own lifestyle 
to mitigate the potential risk. 
This is more like an alert to the 
individuals.”

Kinesiology freshman Devlin 

Francis, a volunteer in Flint, 
said he thought Dolinoy and Xi’s 
research shows there is still a lot 
of work to do in Flint. 

“This was already a crisis 

to begin with, so now it’s only 
worse,” Francis said. “I just 
think it gives an even larger 
reason as to why we all need to 
do something to help out. And, 
like, we’re not going to achieve 
anything by pointing fingers at 
the governor or the city officials 
or anyone, like a lot of people 
have. You can do that later when 
the problem’s been solved, but 
right now there isn’t really time 
for that because people actually 
need help.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Charlie Velis, philanthropy chair 
of Delta Tau Delta, said he thinks 
it is unethical to ignore the water 
crisis in Flint, especially in light 
of the new research and the help 
residents require to rebuild their 
infrastructure.

“We live in a bubble as college 

students, and I think that one 
of the hardest things for me is 
when I see peers try hard to 
remain in that bubble and refrain 
from understanding the really 
important issues around them,” 
Velis said.

Xi said it will be difficult 

to know until further studies 
are done, despite the changing 
microenvironment of the gut 
microbiome, what other types 
of health impacts lead exposure 
could have.

In the future, he said he hopes 

to take a retrospective look at 
past human populations to find 
causal effects of disease and 
health on current populations. 
Xi noted this could be helpful 
for helping the children of 
Flint, noting action should still 
be taken to help them in the 
meantime.

Dolinoy added that Flint is 

a public health issue, and work 
should be done to ensure that 
residents have the knowledge to 
combat the risks of lead to the 
best of their abilities.

“This really tells us that we 

need to invest in our public 
health infrastructure,” Dolinoy 
said.

While studies on mice are the 

start, Dolinoy said they have five 
cohorts of human populations 
being studied, which will be the 
next indicator in this process. 
This additional work being 
done to work will be completed 
when the human cohorts reach 
adulthood.

“Now we know the kids are 

already exposed to the lead, so 
they need to take a mitigation 
approach,” Xi said. “We know 
this information is really good 
for the kids. It is unethical (to not 
take action). If we know a certain 
population is exposed to lead, we 
know there is an increased risk.”

newMICH vice president candidate Micah Griggs , a LSA junior, at the newMICH Speak Out Monday at the Diag. 

spirit of the restaurant will 
stay the same, he added there 
will be changes in the food and 
traditions.

“You don’t want to get too 

much in the past,” Seyferth 
said. “There’s great tradition, 
but we want to bring that 
tradition forward and build 
new memories. The food is 
going to be different, the 
ambiance is going to be a bit 
different.”

Executive chef Neal Diebold 

said the focus of the food will 
be to bring a sense of home to 
the students. He noted that 
students come to campus from 
all around the country, and 
he wants the food to have a 
relaxed and homey feel.

“We are trying to create a 

sense of home,” Diebold said. 
“You are away from home, 
and you have studies, you have 
stress — then you come here 
and you are supposed to relax 
and have memories. This is 
like your second home and this 
is what I am trying to create 
menu-wise.”

One 
of 
the 
restaurant’s 

original traditions was to let 
students celebrating their 21st 
birthdays stand on a stool and 
a ring a bell after drinking 21 
beers. Carlson said he and the 
other owners want to keep the 
birthday aspect of the tradition 
alive, 
but 
will 
not 
make 

drinking 21 beers necessary to 
ring the bell.

“So what we are going to do 

is take that tradition and have 
it for everyone’s birthday,” 
Carlson said. “When you come 

here you will get a special gift, 
which is a little brass bell. You 
will be able to go behind the 
bar upstairs or downstairs and 
ring the bell, and you also get a 
couple gifts.”

Past 
traditions 
and 

memories 
will 
also 
be 

maintained 
through 
black 

and white photos on the 
restaurant’s walls. The photos 
will be of the owners and 
University sports, arts and 
academics.

“We 
feel 
that 
this 
is 

important to show our partners 
and the history of Michigan,” 
Carlson said. “Not just sports 
… This has to be about the arts, 
this has to be about music, has 
to be about student life. We felt 
that was significant to get a 
feeling of why we all are here. 
It is the University of Michigan 
that brings us all together.”

“CSG is about representing 

the students of this body, not 
arbitrary power grab.” Sarkar 
said.

Other executive candidates 

include Public Policy junior

president and vice president, 
respectively, with the Your

Parties 
recently 
debated 

their platform points at a debate 
on Wednesday, as newMICH 
presidential candidate David 
Schafer, 
an 
LSA 
junior, 

repeatedly calling into question 
Hislop’s 
position 
at 
the 

University, which he said was 

priveleged. Hislop emphasized 
his prior leadership in Greek life 
as a way to bring about change.

Schafer and vice presidential 

candidate Micah Griggs, an 
LSA junior, also spoke out 
about inclusion within CSG at 
the rally.

“newMICH was created by 

passionate people from across 
campus who really think that it 
is time to make CSG and campus 
inclusive, representative and 
productive,” Griggs said. 

Sarkar also emphasized the 

speak out aimed to highlight 
what the University community 
wanted to see from student 
government, citing the Idea 
Box on the newMICH website. 
The Idea Box is a suggestion 
form that allows students to 
let newMICH know what they 
would like to see on campus.

Along with remarks from 

newMICH members, the event 

featured 
performances 
by 

dance groups such as Michigan 
Manzil and a capella groups, 
such as Angels on Call and 
58 Greene. There were six 
groups in total, performing 
for 15 minutes each. The 
performances alternated with 
newMICH members detailing 
what they hope to achieve if 
they win the election.

LSA junior Samer Alkhalili, 

who attended the rally, said 
he was enthusiastic about the 
party, despite having a negative 
opinion of CSG in the past. 

“Honestly I’ve had mixed 

feelings towards CSG, and 
that’s 
because 
everyone 

approaches you talking about 
diversity 
and 
inclusivity,” 

Alkhalili said. “But this year 
I got aboard with newMICH 
because they are actually going 
to enact that change rather 
than throw buzzwords.”

“Y

our Time, Your Voice, 
Your Michigan”

Election season is 

in high gear on campus as we take 
to our annual tradition of deciding 
who will lead the student body in 
the upcoming school year. The six 
words quoted at the beginning of this 
article have no doubt been seen by a 
significant portion of our campus. 
These six words are the words being 
used by one party, Your Michigan, 
to campaign on a platform of unity 
on our campus. These six words, 
I fear, are a campaign promise by 
this party’s leaders that will go 
unfulfilled.

Last 
week, 
Central 
Student 

Government hosted its presidential 
and vice presidential debate. As the 
School of Education representative 
on 
CSG 
and 
as 
a 
concerned 

student, I attended to see if the 
debate would sway my vote in the 
election. Both parties, after all, 
offer solid platforms based on real 
changes needed to improve our 
University. From safety and mental 
health to minority representation, 
both 
mainstream 
parties 
are 

represented by a presidential and 
vice presidential candidate who 
have done amazing work to make 
the University of Michigan better. 
This article, I hope, is seen not as 
an attack of their character, but 
rather a discussion of their ideas. 
After hearing their ideas in the 
debate, I now believe that only one 
party’s leadership has a conception 
of leadership that will truly let it 
represent Michigan in full, and that 
leadership is David Schafer and 
Micah Griggs of newMICH.

Now, mine is an opinion that is 

but one voice. However, after being 
on this campus for five years, being 
a student leader for three of those 
years, having worked in and with 
University administration, and now 
looking forward to becoming an 
alum in just a little over a month, I 
believe I have gathered a perspective 
that can be viewed as valuable. Over 
my time at Michigan, I’ve learned 
how to think about the narratives 
people use to discuss issues facing 
communities 
— 
including 
our 

community of Michigan — and it is 
precisely those narratives that, for 
me, distinguish the groups most.

Take the narrative on working 

with administration. At the debate, 
Thomas 
Hislop, 
presidential 

candidate 
for 
Your 
Michigan, 

made a clear distinction between 
how he would “work with” the 
administration 
instead 
of 
just 

“demanding” things as newMICH 
planned to do. Where I believe this 
narrative fails is that the history of 
our own University demonstrates 
that the changes that have most 
greatly affected students on campus 
have only come when students 
demanded 
them. 
Some 
prime 

examples 
are 
female 
students 

working to build the league and 
the Black Action Movements only a 
few short decades ago and even the 
#BBUM movement currently.

Demand does not have to be 

combative — in fact, it can be 
cooperative — but what demand 
does 
is 
hold 
our 
University 

accountable to a student body that 
changes every year. Student leaders 
can have demands and still be 
cooperative and accomplish many 
great things, which the #BBUM 
campaign has surely demonstrated. 
Surely, many — if not most — of the 
great things about this university 
have come from such demands on 
the parts of students. Michigan’s 
students make Michigan great. 

Then there were the narratives 

concerning 
representation 
on 

campus. In terms of discussing 
identity, I honestly believe both 
party’s leaders have a long way to go, 
but I do believe David and Micah are 
much better equipped to handle this 
topic from their first day in office 
than Thomas and Cam.

One way these narratives were 

demonstrated in the debate was 
the discussion about increasing 
minority enrollment. Thomas and 
Cam both discussed their plans 
of outreach to “urban” or “inner-
city” schools. While these outreach 
programs may certainly be helpful, 

they do ignore the fact that a student 
being from an urban city implies 
nothing about their race or other 
identities. Their narratives also 
spoke of these students in very 
privileged ways, assuming that they 
merely lack motivation to succeed 
and decide to come to a place like 
Michigan. As a future educator in the 
city of Detroit, a narrative like this 
is not one I would want my students 
exposed to from college leaders they 
would otherwise admire.

Rather, I would elevate the 

narrative both David and Micah 
discussed 
of 
improving 
the 

environment on campus where 
students 
from 
all 
backgrounds 

would feel welcomed, a theory the 
administration would do well to 
consider in addendum to its current 
initiatives. Minority students do not 
come to this university to appease 
our ideals or bolster our image, 
they come for an education. The 
conversations on campus sorely 
need to shift from what we can 

do to get students from different 
backgrounds here to what we can do 
to make them want to come and stay 
and be proud to become a Michigan 
alum. Schafer and Griggs made it 
clear to me that they understand 
that. Hislop and Dotson made it 
clear that they did not.

This lack of true reflection on 

identity was apparent numerous 
other times in the debate as well. 
When discussing Greek life, all those 
debating generalized our Greek life 
community in problematic ways. 
Both parties seemed to forget that 
numerous identities are present 
within and between Greek life 
organizations.

For instance, Schafer and Griggs 

made the point of CSG not seeming 
representative because of its heavy 
Greek life presence; however, the 
issue is significantly more complex, 
as there are plenty of Greek life 
students who most likely don’t 
feel represented by the Greek life 
students on CSG. While CSG does 
need diversification, looking solely 
to lower the proportion of Greek life 
students present is an essentialist 
rhetoric that does little to solve the 
true problem of representation.

The same issue of missing the 

true problem was present in the 
discussion on mental health. All 
four candidates wanted to discuss 
increasing resources — something 
truly and definitely needed — but 
only the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party candidates discussed working 
past these reactive measures and 
finding proactive ways to improve 
mental 
health 
on 
campus, 
in 

addition to working to figure out 
what on our campus is causing our 
mental health to worsen.

So 
while 
Your 
Michigan’s 

leaders may want their campaign 
to be based on your voice, the 
narratives they use to describe 
the University’s students and their 
experiences make me question 
whether that voice is simply one 
of a majority or one that is truly 
inclusive of all the University’s 
students. Who would be leading 
if they were to be elected: the 
leaders who think all voices 
should be heard or the ones who 
actively 
silenced 
some 
voices 

during our last assembly meeting? 
If we want our fellow Wolverines 
to feel “heard, protected and 
empowered” — as Hislop and 
Dotson have claimed they want 
to — erasing their experiences in a 
guise of unity is merely a negative 
peace which removes contention 
instead of a positive peace which 
promotes inclusion. So as we take 
to the polls, I ask our student body, 
who will lead CSG?

streaming 

service. 
I 

already pay to 
stream 
music 

with 
Spotify, 

and I don’t need a second monthly 
subscription payment for this one 
particular album.

But then, Kanye announced he 

would be making adjustments to 
the album, tinkering with songs and 
fixing instrumentals. This is great 
news for Tidal as it may cause fans 
like myself to return to the platform. 
These adjustments to the album are 
hardly surprising — given Kanye’s 
recent manic behavior — but equally 
unheard of. Changing an album after 
its release hasn’t been possible to this 
extent before the age of streaming.

TechCrunch is calling Kanye’s The 

Life of Pablo the first “Streaming as a 
Service” album. What that means is 
by adding bonus tracks and updating 
existing songs, Kanye can transform 
The Life of Pablo from a static 
product to a fluid service. Treating 
albums like software — with minor 
updates, new artwork and additional 
content — redefines the album 
experience. Instead of streaming 
simply being a more convenient way 
to listen, its convenience enables 
albums to live and grow in real 
time on these platforms. It took an 
overconfident, experimental artist 

to show us an opportunity that’s 
been here all along. We’ve been too 
focused on streaming as a means to 
greater efficiency, rather than what 
that efficiency can make possible.

However, there are questions 

that need to be answered: How will 
this change consumer habits? Does 
having multiple versions of an album 
improve or detract from the value 
of an album? Could this be applied 
to playlists as well? In my opinion, 
the most important question is how 
to effectively display each version. 
Should new versions replace the 
old ones or exist concurrently? 
Should you be able to identify new 
updates similarly to annotations via 
SoundCloud and Google Docs? The 
answers are not intuitive because we 
haven’t historically thought about 
music in this manner.

Such a model, if it catches on, 

could mean that we are entering a 
more interactive era of music. At a 
time when experiences seem to be 

valued more than material objects, 
an interactive model could very 
plausibly have large-scale appeal. I 
expect some amount of resistance 
toward such a large philosophical 
shift.

People 
will 
argue 
that 
it 

diminishes the art in some way, 
evidenced by the fear that iTunes, 
for example, would disrupt the 
recording industry. However, if we 
can embrace a contemporary way to 

engage with the creative process of 
music, the economic implications of 
adoption are large.

This is good news for streaming 

services. Tidal has an opportunity 
to lock in subscribers and guarantee 
return users. This is even better 
news for artists if they can generate 
revenue throughout the process of 
building an album. This would not 
only potentially impact the way 
we perceive albums, but also how 
we think about album releases. 
Kanye is showing us that artists 
need not complete an album before 
capitalizing on it financially — that’s 
the untapped power of streaming.

Kanye is known for treating 

each album as an opportunity to 
do 
something 
completely 
new. 

His previous albums (i.e. 808s & 
Heartbreak and Yeezus) each took 
risks sonically that influenced how 
hiphop sounds. The Life of Pablo 
may change music in a much larger 
way. It’s possible that his decision to 
publicly change the album’s name 
and tracklist multiple times was part 
of an attempt to frame this album 
as the first of its kind. He has even 
acknowledged the project as a “living 
breathing creative expression.”

If Kanye were aware of the 

implications this innovation could 
have on the album format and 
contemporary music in general, 
perhaps 
his 
manic 
behavior 

was more calculated than we 
thought. Maybe his rants about 
the greatness of this project were 
not alluding to lyrical content 
or instrumentation — he’s still 
updating those elements anyway. 
I think Kanye knew what he was 
doing all along and we’re just 
realizing it now.

The untapped power of streaming

MICHAEL CHRZAN | OP-ED

Who will lead CSG?

“Treating albums 

like software... 

redefines the album 

experience.”

“Minority students 
do not come to this 
university to appease 

our ideals or bolster our 
image, they come for an

O

n Feb. 1, 2016, I heard the words 
coming from presidential candidate 
Donald Trump’s lips on national 

television:

“I want to thank the 

people of Michigan,” after 
he won the Michigan 
Republican primary.

Seeing 
the 
popular 

support for Trump in my 
home state sparked my 
curiosity to answer the 
question: Why do people 
support 
Trump? 
What 

I discovered was many 
Trump supporters want 
security for themselves, 
a strong leader who does 
not walk on eggshells and/or economic 
prosperity from a leader they think cannot 
be bought by lobbyists. Trump gives people, 
at face value, exactly the type of anti-
establishment rhetoric they look for and he 
always has a solution for problems presented 
to the public, but at what cost?

Trump supporters highlight that his hate-

filled rhetoric and hasty generalizations 
are not the source of the problem, but are 
instead simply the manifestation of fear that 
U.S. politicians and mainstream media have 
perpetuated 
for 
years. 

He puts the blame on 
minorities, which causes 
an increase in the negative 
portrayal of minorities 
— a cost that has great 
ramifications in Black and 
brown communities. This 
also encourages people 
to 
express 
themselves 

using 
hateful 
speech, 

essentially normalizing it. 
This is dangerous in itself 
because instead of taking 
a nuanced approach to each issue, people 
look for action and quick solutions.

As Trump supporters use the slogan 

“Make America Great Again,” we should 
think about the implications of such a 
statement and what it means to go back to 
an America of the past. Trump’s rhetoric 
really is not so far from what people have 
been hearing in the past years, but what he 
is doing is offering solutions that are hard-
lined and to the point. As Islamophobia 
in America is perpetuated by the media, 
illegal immigrants are used as a scapegoat 
for America’s economic problems and Black 
youth are portrayed as thugs, the American 
people are left with the fear of seemingly 
imminent threats with no tangible solutions. 
Trump is thus seen as the savior from the 
same chaos that has been prophesized by 
the very media and the very politicians who 
speak against him now. When the foundation 
of fear has been built up this high, it is 
possible that there is no stopping the chaos 
from unfolding if Donald Trump becomes 
president. As many of us try to separate 
ourselves from the comments that Donald 

Trump makes, we should see him for what 
he is, which is a reflection of what America 
has become today. As we try to separate 
ourselves from his words, we should take a 
good look in the mirror and ask ourselves:

Are we all Trump?
Do we, even to a small extent, all 

embody what Donald Trump portrays on 
international news stations? Do we fear 
those who are different from us or hold 
implicit prejudice views of others, which 
Donald Trump is simply stating without 
apologizing for it? Do we really do things 
only for our own monetary success without 
thinking of the consequences of our actions? 
If we are Trump, then how is it that we can 
point to Trump supporters as bigoted or 
outliers in the American viewpoint? After 
all, these supporters claim themselves even 
more American than say, a small Muslim 
woman from the suburbs of Oakland County, 
Mich. And maybe they’re right, maybe they 
are just more American and we cannot blame 
them for wanting Donald Trump to become 
president — they just want someone to give 
them what politicians and the media refuse 
them: A secure future.

People are tired of living in fear, but the 

people they blame for their problems are 
their American neighbors. Donald Trump 

runs the slogan “Make 
America Great Again,” 
but what does that really 
mean? Is it back to the 
time 
when 
blackface 

was worn in theaters 
and put in headlines? 
Is it one where we have 
a 
president 
that 
the 

Mexican president and 
Pope liken to Stalin?

Progress 
is 
about 

moving 
forward 
and 

recognizing 
mistakes, 

and Donald Trump is just showing us what 
those mistakes are. What Americans are 
brought up to believe is that this nation was 
built on ideals of liberty and freedom, but the 
truth is that the constitution was not written 
to include minorities or women. Since that 
time, great progress has been made in the 
way of obtaining rights for these groups, but 
in a time when police brutality, racism and 
Islamophobia are on the rise, the movement 
to rid political correctness is a dangerous one.

As people begin to believe that hate speech 

is an acceptable form of freedom of speech that 
should be upheld as something progressive, 
more and more people are harmed by the 
rhetoric of Donald Trump and find it acceptable 
to unleash the part of us that is Donald Trump 
— the part of us that lives our lives based on fear 
of one another and clings to an old glorious past 
that never existed.

On the chance that Donald Trump does 

become president, I will not live my life in fear.

I will not let myself be Donald Trump.

Gwen’s bright ‘Truth’

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

One of the many great lines from 

the vastly underrated 2014 rom-
com “Obvious Child” seems to 
speak to strug-
gling 
artists 

everywhere: 
“Creative ener-
gy 
sometimes 

comes from the 
lowest 
point 

in your life.” 
Whether you’re 
a writer, film-
maker or musi-
cian, a crappy 
moment in life 
can be the best 
starting point to something great, 
even if means starting over com-
pletely.

Gwen Stefani is no stranger to 

grappling with this kind of expe-
rience. After ending her 13-year 
marriage with Gavin Rossdale, 
Stefani hit a few bumps on the road 
to her comeback record, which was 
originally scheduled to be released 
in 2014. Luckily, a fresh perspec-
tive on her songwriting and a bur-
geoning romance with “The Voice” 
co-star Blake Shelton culminated 
into what would become her third 
record, This is What the Truth 
Feels Like, a relentlessly optimistic 
album about letting go of the past 
and relishing in the glory of the 
present. 

Throughout the record, Stefani 

focuses on this duality between the 
past and the present, especially on 

the bouncy opener “Misery,” where 
she discusses forgetting about a 
previous lover as she accepts a new 
one. Even after “Misery” trick-
les to a close, Stefani manages to 
keep the song’s refreshing energy 
going throughout the rest of This 
is What the Truth Feels Like, such 
as with the trap-inspired “You’re 
My Favorite” and the ska-infused 
“Where Would I Be?” But perhaps 
Stefani’s 
biggest 
breakthrough 

moment comes at the record’s 
fourth track, “Make Me Like You.”

In addition to its wonderful, 

bright music video, “Make Me 
Like You” is Stefani’s best and most 
polished work since 2006’s “The 
Sweet Escape.” The track’s buoy-
ant, glamorous rhythm and infec-
tious lyrics perfectly encapsulate 
the giddy adrenaline rush of start-
ing a new romantic relationship (in 
this case, with Blake Shelton). But 
while Stefani’s gushes are playful 
and sweet, her true feelings and 
emotional maturity are palpable. 
This isn’t just a silly love song 
about a girl with a simple crush — 
it’s about someone who’s ready to 
move on with her life and who has 
found someone new to share her 
life with.

The central theme to This is 

What the Truth Feels Like may 
grow tiresome at times, but Ste-
fani’s glowing ambition only fuels 
more innovative breakup anthems 
and romantic odes. The acoustic-
heavy “Truth” and saccharine 
synth jingle “Used to Love You” are 
sensible both in their sound and 
lyrical delivery; the groovy dance-

hall jam “Send Me a Picture” and 
the vaudevillian “Naughty” are fun 
detours into flirtation; “Me With-
out You” and “Rare,” the record’s 
final tracks, are among the album’s 
catchiest and funkiest. There are, 
of course, a few weak moments on 
the record, particularly with “Ask-
ing 4 It,” a trivial hip-hop exercise 
with a head-scratching feature 
from Fetty Wap. Even more cringe-
worthy is Stefani quasi-rapping on 
the strange, operatic “Red Flag,” 
which slightly undermines Ste-
fani’s personal growth. But honest-
ly, what would you expect from the 
singer who did “Hollaback Girl” 
and “Wind It Up”?

If there’s one person who’s an 

expert in expressing the ups and 
downs of relationships through 
pop music, it’s Gwen Stefani 
(though Taylor Swift also has a 
compelling case). This skill can be 
traced back to 1995, when Stefani’s 
rocky romance with her No Doubt 
bandmate Tony Kanal inspired hits 
like “Sunday Morning,” “Hey You” 
and most notably, “Don’t Speak.” 
But what makes This is What the 
Truth Feels Like so distinctive from 
other pop records is its ability to 
deftly balance both the closure of 
old relationships and the excite-
ment of new ones. Considering Ste-
fani’s scope and breadth of musical 
experience, her words have been 
able to transcend the barriers of 
music. Despite only three albums 
under her belt, Stefani’s influence 
over pop is powerful, especially 
with an album as wholesome as 
This is What the Truth Feels Like.

TV REVIEW
An off the rails start 
to ‘Bates’ season four

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

The season four premiere of 

“Bates Motel” leads the show 
from a slow-burning thriller to 
the 
unavoid-

able trainwreck 
it was always 
meant 
to 
be. 

Freddie 
High-

more (“August 
Rush”) portrays 
the young Nor-
man Bates in 
the series, who, 
in the span of a 
season, has gone 
from the creepy 
kid down the 
street to the psychotic killer and 
motel manager in Hitchcock’s 
1960 
thriller 
“Psycho.” 
From 

the beginning, fans have always 
known what to expect out of 
“Bates Motel,” as the concrete five-
year track the showrunners estab-
lished at the start will lead up to 
Marion Crane’s doomed check-in 
to the motel. Norman Bates, previ-
ously only psychologically unbal-
anced, is about one grain of sand 
away from becoming the infamous 
son-turned-psychotic serial killer.

Season three was arguably the 

most thrilling season, starting 
with a funeral and ending with 
a bang — and by “bang” I mean 
another murder. We (almost) 
saw Norman escape his mother 
for good, despite her restrain-
ing attempts to keep him home, 
and finally run away into the 
theoretical sunset with Bradley 
(Nicola Peltz, “Transformers: Age 
of Extinction”). Even though Nor-
man, during this time, is psycho-
logically unstable, maybe some 
time away from his mother (Vera 
Farmiga, “The Conjuring”) would 
help him work out those incestual 
desires he’s been having? Well, we 
were wrong. So, so wrong. It only 

took an exit sign at the city’s bor-
ders before Norman ultimately 
became “Mother.” He’s no lon-
ger hallucinating his mother; he 
actually thinks that he’s Norma 
Bates. So “Mother” bashed Brad-
ley’s head against some rocks, and 
season three ended with a lov-
ing embrace between mother and 
son. All of this chaos just makes 
up the precursor to season four’s 
premiere.

After killing Bradley, Nor-

man has been missing for a few 
days. While Norma is out of her 
mind with worry, Norman is just 
out of his mind. He’s found in a 
field, seemingly yelling at nobody, 
but we all know he’s talking to 
“Mother.” This scene is impor-
tant because before it, we didn’t 
really have any idea just how far 
Norman had gone. Highmore’s 
performance is out of this world 
and believably psychotic. Not 
shortly after, Norman is admit-
ted into a psychiatric hospital (at 
which point I’m certain there was 
a chorus of “finally!” among fans) 
and we once again get to see High-
more creepily staring at the ceiling 
with a blank, expressionless face. 
I don’t think Norman is all right. 
But apparently Norma does, as 
she discharges him and takes him 
back home ASAP.

Meanwhile, 
Emma 
(Olivia 

Cooke, “Me and Earl and the 
Dying Girl”) is receiving the lung 
transplant that could save her life. 
Amid all of the drama and lies … 
more drama. But this is a different 
kind of drama. Whereas the “Nor-
man drama” of the show leads to a 
skin-crawling feeling that leaves 
you thinking that he’s finally 
lost all touch with humanity, the 
“Emma drama” focuses more on 
the emotional, heart-wrenching 
aspect of the series. Who wouldn’t 
be scared to get a transplant? We 
get to see Dylan’s (Max Thieriot, 
“Point Break”) love for Emma, 

which really adds an emotional 
relief to the darkness that’s been 
falling on the Bates family recent-
ly. Especially now that Emma is 
out of the woods, we can focus 
more on what we’re going to do 
about Norman, who just sponta-
neously murdered Emma’s absen-
tee mother in the psyche of none 
other than “Mother.” The murders 
are coming quicker now, and Nor-
man’s mannerisms are shifting to 
become more feminine. Highmore 
is becoming completely invested in 
his character’s transition from the 
son to the mother — all it would 
take is a wig and the audience 
could become thoroughly con-
vinced that Highmore is a woman.

Yup, Norman has finally lost 

it. And Norma is thinking that 
she should have gotten him help 
a lot sooner. From there, we get 
to see Norma’s poor care, or lack 
thereof, of Norman’s psychiatric 
issues. During the episode, mul-
tiple psychiatrists get to call her 
out for abuse, so maybe Norma is 
finally coming to the realization 
that blackouts that lead to mur-
derous rampages is something she 
should look into. Overall, it’s ulti-
mately unclear the direction the 
show will be taking for the sea-
son. To keep Norman out of state 
care, she has to find him a doctor 
and obtain a diagnosis. Especially 
since Norman can no longer dis-
tinguish dreaming from blacking 
out, a wedge in their relationship 
will surely form over who is actu-
ally committing the murders — 
Norma or “Mother”? However, it 
won’t be too long until something 
sets him off again, leading to the 
final murder of Norma Bates and 
the ultimate climax in the birth 
of Norman’s persona as “Mother.” 
Although Hitchcock coined “we 
all go a little mad sometimes” 
from an older Norman Bates, our 
Norman is too far gone for “some-
times.”

TV REVIEW
Heartbreaking ‘Day’

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

It was a hot summer day in 

July when my dad and I stepped 
into the Circle in the Square The-
ater 
in 
New 

York 
City 
to 

see “Lady Day 
at 
Emerson’s 

Bar & Grill.” 
We were ush-
ered into our 
seats, an area 
with tables and 
chairs set up 
like a jazz club 
in the center of 
the theater’s in-the-round seating. 
The band was playing some music, 
setting the mood for the evening 
to come. Then, the lights came 
down, Audra McDonald (“Private 
Practice”) walked from the back of 
the “club” to the stage and we were 
taken for a journey neither of us 
will ever forget.

That was my perspective before 

watching HBO’s taping of a special 
New Orleans performance. “Lady 
Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill” is 
one of my favorite productions I’ve 
seen on Broadway. I hoped I could 
relive the experience of being 
in the room where it happened 
through the taping. And relive it I 
did. McDonald brought the same 
power to her portrayal of Billie 
Holiday as she did during that day 
nearly two years ago, bringing back 

the same emotions from me as she 
is nothing short of amazing in it.

“Lady Day,” billed on Broadway 

as a play with music, portrays a fic-
tionalized account of one of Holi-
day’s last concerts in Philadelphia 
in March 1959, four months before 
her death in July at age 44. Dur-
ing the “concert,” she sings several 
of her seminal jazz hits, including 
“God Bless the Child” and “Strange 
Fruit.” 
Interspersed 
between 

the songs are scenes of dialogue, 
where Holiday tells stories from 
her life and of her troubles, as she 
loses control of herself throughout 
the evening due to drinking and 
drugs.

While the vocal transforma-

tion McDonald does to play Holi-
day could easily become a bad 
impersonation, McDonald is able 
to bring layers to the character 
through pure emotion and perfor-
mance ability. The most impres-
sive element of her performance 
is how she modifies her voice to 
match Holiday’s. McDonald tra-
ditionally has a big, bold and gor-
geous soprano, but to play Holiday, 
she restrains it. Instead, her voice 
is soft and sweet, gradually grow-
ing weaker as Holiday deteriorates 
throughout the night. She embod-
ies Holiday’s voice, bringing a 
sense of beauty to every note she 
sings.

What stops the performance 

from being a pure impersonation is 
the amount of pathos she brings to 

the character through the show’s 
dialogue. She delivers a remark-
able amount of emotional layers to 
her performance as Holiday talks 
about how she was raped at age 
ten, how she was a prostitute as a 
teenager, her tough relationship 
with her mother and the racism 
she faced as she toured around the 
country. When Holiday got to the 
point where she needed to take 
drugs to continue performing, 
McDonald made me feel Holiday’s 
pain. This show is just Holiday, 
her band and a microphone, and 
McDonald carries it all the way 
through.

“Do you know what I want? I 

want a beautiful home. And some 
kids. And I wanna cook. And I want 
something else too. I want a club. 
My own club. It’s very small, it’s 
very cozy. It’s just someplace where 
I can sing to all my friends. What 
else is there?”

That’s the last line of dialogue 

in the show, and it breaks my 
heart every time I hear it. Holiday 
never had a chance at that life and 
deserved so much better than what 
she had, and that’s the tragedy 
that drives “Lady Day.” McDon-
ald won her record-setting sixth 
Tony Award for her performance 
on Broadway, and HBO giving 
people this opportunity to see her 
brilliance makes me so happy. Or 
at least as happy as being able to 
relive one of my favorite theatrical 
experiences.

Stamps presents 
unique animator

David O’Reilly gives 
St. Patrick’s Day talk 
on his creative life

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

On St. Patrick’s Day, The 

Michigan Theater and Penny 
Stamps Lecture Series appropri-
ately welcomed Irish-born ani-
mator David O’Reilly. Known for 
his stripped-down 3D graphics, 
O’Reilly has earned acclaim for 
his short films, video games and 
animation work on the hilari-
ous video games in Spike Jonze’s 
“Her.”

“It started when I was about 

fifteen, and I discovered the 
work of Egon Schiele,” O’Reilly 
said of his career Thursday night.

He 
walked 
the 
audience 

through the past fifteen years of 
his creative career, explaining 
how he went from a technique-
obsessed draftsman to an uncon-
ventional 3D animator.

“For years when I first started, 

I just wanted to be good at draw-
ing,” he said.

This obsession with being 

“good” 
structured 
much 
of 

O’Reilly’s early career as a con-
cept painter, until he discovered 
3D animation.

“I sort of threw that all away 

when I made my first film which 
is ‘RGB XYZ.’ ”

When he first dove into the 

world of 3D animation, the medi-
um was reserved almost exclu-
sively for commercial work.

“This wasn’t something that 

people were doing alone … It 
wasn’t something for a creator 
to do,” he said. “You couldn’t do 
anything poetic in it.” 

O’Reilly has extensively stud-

ied the history and theory of ani-
mation. He points to the work of 
John Kricfalusi as an inspiration 

and, in his opinion, as the peak of 
2D animation.

“It felt like 3D was something 

totally different, like it didn’t 
have to play by those rules,” he 
said.

As with any new medium, the 

process of learning and master-
ing 3D animation was not an 
easy one. O’Reilly keeps a folder 
of screenshots of his glitches, 
which he views as sketches of his 
finished work.

“When you make something 

in 3D it’s a constant process of 
everything falling apart,” he said.

What O’Reilly seems to strive 

for — and achieve — more than 
anything in his work is empathy. 
The films he considers “failures” 
share a certain lack of empa-
thy, and likewise his successes 
abound with it. Even “RGB XYZ,” 
one of his earlier and visually 
cruder films, finds tremendous 
emotional depth and complexity.

“Somehow there is empathy 

going on with this character, and 
that was mind-blowing to me,” 
O’Reilly said.

The emotional response the 

film sparked in his audiences was 
surprising to O’Reilly, he added.

“So many rules are discarded 

here, so much of this is about let-
ting go of this nostalgia that was 
around animation.”

But, O’Reilly doesn’t necessar-

ily think of himself as a storytell-
er. “I think the word storyteller is 
mostly bullshit and its just kind 
of a meme word nowadays,” he 
said. For him, film is about col-
lecting ideas and information 
and presenting it to the viewer in 
a way that is compelling.

Even his more narrative work, 

like his most popular film “Please 
Say Something,” is more a collec-
tion of related scenes that it is a 
linear story. And despite its lack 
of narrative, the film is tremen-
dously compelling and heart-
breaking. O’Reilly riffs on the 

classic animation cat and mouse 
story as he follows their passion-
ate and tumultuous relationship.

The film’s lack of narra-

tive and basic, stripped down 
design lends an air of absurdity 
to O’Reilly’s work. The films 
are hilarious on their own — a 
short O’Reilly screened Thurs-
day about a horse trying to 
make friends was met with an 
uproar of laughter — but the 
crude quirkiness of their visuals 
heightens the humor.

Recently, O’Reilly has focused 

his attention on video games. 
In 2014, he released the game 
“Mountain,” a role-player game 
without any controls in which the 
user plays as a mountain floating 
in space. O’Reilly laughed as he 
discussed the uproar from the 
gaming community at the game’s 
unconventional structure.

“I think for a lot of people this 

felt very abstract or conceptual, 
but it’s very, very simple and it 
just follows the line of thinking 
that we can emphasize with any-
thing,” he said.

That thinking carries through 

into 
his 
forthcoming 
game 

“Everything,” which he demoed 
on Thursday night. Like the 
name would suggest, the game 
allows players to play as any-
thing, moving through the world 
as a rock or a bear or an atom 
or even, as O’Reilly showed the 
audience, a dancing solar system.

O’Reilly is a master of emo-

tional responses. He finished 
his talk by reading a letter from 
a mother whose son was deeply 
affected by “Mountain,” finding 
himself both mentally stimulated 
by and empathetic to the moun-
tain. Despite his unconventional-
ity, O’Reilly taps into something 
deeply emotional and personal 
in everything he does — whether 
it’s a short film about a cat and 
mouse or a video game about a 
mountain.

‘Allegiant’ destroys 
the young adult genre

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

The moral universe of “Alle-

giant” is insane. The film picks 
up where “Insurgent” left off. 
The “Faction-
less,” led by 
Four’s 
(Theo 

James, 
“You 

Will 
Meet 

a Tall Dark 
Stranger”) 
estranged 
mom 
Evelyn 

(Naomi Watts, 

“While We’re Young”) have 
miraculously succeeded in their 
rebellion against the powerful 
technology-wielding 
central 

government of post-apocalyp-
tic Chicago (yes, the Divergent 
series is set in Chicago). But 
Tris (Shailene Woodley, “The 
Fault in Our Stars”) believes 
there’s humanity outside the 
walls of the city, on the word 
of her martyred mother. So 
far, things make sense. Now 
that the power-hungry psy-
chos have been deposed, we’re 
going to install a central gov-
ernment that doesn’t divide 
people based on categories so 
lurid and inane they could only 
come from a childish dystopian 
thriller, right? And next, we’ll 
send a small envoy outside the 
wall, because blindly remain-
ing inside a city and forbidding 
everyone to leave for no appar-
ent reason is crazy, right?

Whatever. The trials for the 

dethroned 
Chicago 
govern-

ment thugs begin. The trials 
turn into executions. The Fac-
tionless have done away with 
the defunct Faction system of 
government, and without neat 
little categories, Chicago has 
fallen under mob rule. Johan-
na (“Octavia Spencer, “Snow-
piercer”), former leader of the 
“Amity” faction (read: the obvi-
ous good guys), sees everything 
going to hell and wants to rein-
state the Factions so people stop 
killing each other. She takes 
charge of the dissenters and 
names them the “Allegiant,” as 
in, allegiant to the old system 
of government. So now, Evelyn 
and Johanna sit down at a table 
with a handful of their top advi-
sors, including Tris, de-facto 
leader of the former “Daunt-
less” — despite being cute, 
sixteen and apparently well-
shampooed — and they all dis-
cuss how they can preserve the 
infrastructure, prosperity and 
humanity of their tiny nation, 
right? Instead, they all pull 
out guns. Including the former 
members of Amity.

Tris, our hero, cares deeply 

about the people of Chicago. So 
she speaks up and tells every-
one they’re being stupid, right? 
She tells her boyfriend’s mom 
that violence isn’t cool, right? 
Nah, she’s out. She escapes the 
walls of Chicago with Four, her 
brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort, 
“The Fault in Our Stars”) and 
a couple other eye-candy party 
members. They’re greeted out-
side by the Real Government, 
who tell us that Chicago is a 
big genetic experiment and 
that everyone in dystopian Chi-
cago is merely a specimen in 
a hyper-sophisticated breed-
ing terrarium overseen by the 
Bureau. 
Apparently, 
human 

genetic modification caused a 
nuclear apocalypse and Chi-
cago is an attempt to get the 
human genome to revert to an 
au naturel state. A minute of 
nonsensical scientific justifica-
tion later and we’re mostly cool 
with this status quo. David (Jeff 
Daniels, “The Newsroom”), the 
head of the Bureau, tells Tris 
that the “Divergent” (i.e. her-
self) are everything the experi-
ment has been looking for. Tris 

is upset that everyone she’s ever 
known is currently killing each 
other, and asks David to inter-
vene in the experiment. David, 
the biggest liar who’s ever lied, 
says, sure, honey, just come with 
me and I’ll talk to the Council, 
who are the Real Bosses.

Meanwhile, the Bureau has 

Four suited up, skimming the 
post-apocalyptic 
hellscape 

for settlements. He descends 
upon one with a hundred other 
Bureau meatheads and witness-
es the Bureau taking children 
back to its not-irradiated tech 
castle. They leave the parents 
of the kids to die out there, or 
in some cases, shoot the parents 
themselves. Then they wipe 
the kids’ memories. They seem 
to have the technology to com-
pletely de-irradiate people, but 
they rip the families apart any-
way. No explanation. This isn’t 
one of those moral cliffhangers 
that turns out to have a twisty-
but-reasonable explanation. It’s 
just insane. They fly around 
saving starving, irradiated kids 
whose families have no weap-
ons that could possibly pierce 
their personal force fields, and 
yet they tote giant guns and 
screw the parents for no iden-
tifiable reason. This is top-shelf 
nonsense.

So Tris goes to the Council, 

finds out that David is a liar, and 
hightails it back to Chicago to 
save her people. Four has already 
tried this, but he was remarkably 
ineffective, so his rebel-turned-
dictator mom locked him up and 
now Tris has to save him in addi-
tion to stopping the war. Only 
now, David wants to mass-wipe 
the memories of everyone in 
Chicago with the same memory-
wipe gas he’s been using on the 
settlement children. Why is he 
suddenly cool with intervening 
in his own experiment to save 
lives? No idea, but if there were 
ever a good reason to mind-con-
trol an entire city, it would be 
to stop ongoing genocide. Tris 
isn’t cool with this, however. 
She saves Four and they blow up 
the gas machine. The kids save 
the day, except for that geno-
cidal war that’s still going on. 
But we’ll get to that in the next 
movie.

The last moral lesson in 

this movie is that violence 
solves problems and nuclear 
unmanned drones are an awe-
some idea. Tris’s crew puts a 
bomb in an unmanned craft, 
sets it on autopilot and sends 
it back to the Bureau. The last 
scene in the movie is the crown 
jewel of unintentional Holly-
wood irony. Tris and her homies 
watch their drone-nuke blast 
the Bureau to smithereens from 
the edge of Chicago, while Tris’s 
overdubbed voice explains the 
importance of working together 
and eschewing constructs that 
divide and hurt people.

I mostly blame the main 

writer, Noah Oppenheim (“The 
Maze Runner”), but frankly, no 
one involved with this movie 
has any excuse. This whole fran-
chise is The Hunger Games on a 
bad acid trip. My IQ has dropped 
twenty points and my soul needs 
a shower. Let Chicago burn. I’m 
done.

FILM REVIEW
‘Home’ depicts a 
somber New York

Re-release of 1977 
experimental film 

shows a cold Big Apple

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

1977 was New York’s year in 

film. Between “Annie Hall” and 
“New York, New York,” cinema’s 
two unabashed 
New 
York-

lovers, 
Woody 

Allen 
and 

Martin 
Scors-

ese, 
released 

their love let-
ters to the city. 
That 
same 

year, 
Belgian 

experimen-
tal 
filmmaker 

Chantal Aker-
man (“Jeanne Dielman”) released 
her ode to the city: “News from 
Home,” shown on Wednesday at 
the Ann Arbor Film Festival in a 
new 16 mm print that was mak-
ing its American debut. “News 
from Home,” simply enough, is 
85 minutes of Akerman reading 
aloud letters sent to her from her 
mother when she lived in New 
York in the early 1970s. Essential-
ly, we read what she was reading. 
And we see what she was seeing, 
too. Each shot is a meticulously 
crafted slice of New York life.

Akerman’s New York is far 

from idyllic. Rather, it’s cold and 
empty. Its residents seem unwel-
coming and always on the move. 

Akerman was all of 21 when she 
moved by herself from Belgium 
to New York. For a young woman 
alone in its streets, the expanse of 
New York is at once captivating 
and terrifying. Akerman refuses 
to romanticize. She is document-
ing. From the first shot of the film, 
a narrow corridor, only slightly 
wider than an alleyway, with an 
occasional pedestrian or car pass-
ing, it’s clear that Akerman wasn’t 
living as a tourist in the city. She 
was, instead, a quiet resident, 
observing the character and char-
acters of the “real” New York. At 
times dark and eerie, and at times 
whimsical, Akerman shows us the 
daytime (and occasional night-
time) New York of Sidney Lumet 
and Woody Allen, Martin Scors-
ese and Spike Lee.

The letters from Akerman’s 

mother are our only characters. 
Each letter reprimands Chantal 
for not immediately responding, 
describes some bit of minutiae 
in the older Akerman’s every-
day life, or requests that Chantal 
spend some of the money she has 
sent. Time seems to slow as the 
film progresses, with the space 
between each letter widening and 
widening. Towards the beginning, 
the letters come frequently, and 
her mother’s nagging is, frankly, 
annoying. And yet, as time passes, 
we begin to miss the letters. The 
New York scenes can grow repeti-
tive, or even mind-numbingly 
boring, that we begin to cling to 
something new. For a later por-
tion of the film, in which Aker-
man is driving along the coast of 

Manhattan, looking inward to 
the city, seconds, minutes, hours 
seem to pass until when we next 
hear from the mother. Perhaps, 
for Akerman, the thrill of inde-
pendence died after a few weeks 
or months, and the painstaking 
ache for contact from loved ones 
grew and grew.

To the extent of determining 

whether the film captures Aker-
man’s experience in New York 
from 1971 to 1972, “News from 
Home” is impossible to judge. The 
film is miniscule in its aim — to 
capture one person’s emotions 
and city experiences over the 
course of year — yet could stand in 
to represent the New York immi-
grant artist experience of the 
1970s, or perhaps even the entire 
immigrant experience. And yet, it 
never seems like a complete depic-
tion of her time there. Where does 
she live? What does she do daily? 
How do people treat her?

In the film, everyone is going 

somewhere — walking, driving 
and riding the subway. We rarely 
see a destination, a place where 
people have arrived. Even Times 
Square — the ultimate New York 
tourist spectacle — is reduced to 
its corresponding subway stop. 
Perhaps this is how Akerman 
perceived the New York experi-
ence — always on the move, never 
stopping at a destination, only 
endless ambition. Whether that 
determination is to be respected 
or detested is never addressed. 
The experience is left up to end-
less interpretation, but only Aker-
man knows the answers.

Michigan’s long-awaited return

T

he night the streak ended, 
they rolled out a red 
carpet.

It was March 24, 2013, at 

Joe Louis 
Arena, and 
that carpet, 
extending 
from the 
rink’s 
entrance, 
became the 
only thing 
separating 
Notre 
Dame from 
its CCHA 
Championship trophy.

Its purpose was to celebrate 

the Fighting Irish, but as the 
carpet unrolled, bit by bit, it also 
served to taunt Michigan, which 
saw its streak of 22 consecutive 
NCAA Tournament appearances 
reset to zero that night.

Still in his net several minutes 

after the final horn stood Steve 
Racine, embraced by his senior 
captain A.J. Treais, watching a 
strip of red cross out his team’s 
sparkling record.

For the ensuing three years, 

the broken streak has been all 
anyone cared about. Racine’s 
senior class, and those that came 
after it, were burdened with a 
historic legacy as a measuring 
stick. Making the tournament 
was the expectation that came 
with signing a letter of intent for 
Red Berenson.

In 2000, when Mike 

Komisarek signed his own letter, 
that standard was apparent.

Even then, Michigan had 

already appeared in the NCAA 
Tournament for a decade 
straight, and he added to that 
total during his two-year career.

When Komisarek returned to 

Ann Arbor as an undergraduate 
assistant coach in 2015, the 
winning standard neither 

changed around him nor within 
him. To him, the goal for the 
Wolverines’ current squad was 
simple.

“It’s about getting back to 

where we were, where we’re 
supposed to be,” Komisarek said 
in October.

Saturday, with a 5-3 win 

against Minnesota, Michigan 
made damn sure it would be back 
this year — earning an automatic 
bid to the NCAA Tournament 
with its victory.

And in a season that has come 

full circle from 2013, the fact that 
the Wolverines will face Notre 
Dame for the first time since that 
March night seems like a symbol 
of fate.

The road back to this point has 

been a long and painful one, to 
be sure. It only recently became 
a straight path — one on which 
Michigan exorcised the demons 
that have followed it since Racine 
and his senior classmates were 
left on the wrong end of the red 
carpet.

In 2013, they were tasked with 

starting over when, in reality, 
a fresh start was impossible. 
Twenty-two years on the 
national stage erase that option.

For three years, that pressure 

continued to mount on their 
shoulders, and consistently, it 
proved too daunting to overcome.

Each of those years, the 

Wolverines entered the conference 
tournament needing one extra win 
in order for their season to live on. 
And every time, their season died 
there — first against Notre Dame, 
then in the opening round against 
Penn State in 2014 and finally 
in the championship against 
Minnesota in 2015.

Recollections of mid-season 

stumbles and late-season 
collapses began to simultaneously 
push the 22-year run farther 
from people’s memories and 

further cement it as the measure 
of success.

The team’s legacy was being 

written, and they didn’t have any 
way to edit it.

Michigan entered this season 

having felt the pain that comes in 
place of a postseason too often. 
Its players had fielded questions 
at a final press conference with 
bloodshot, teary eyes too many 
times. And while they never 
said it, it sure seemed like they 
had heard enough of the 22-year 
streak they had yet to rekindle.

That’s why, to begin their 

campaign, the Wolverines didn’t 
want to leave anything to chance. 
They didn’t want to scrape into 
the NCAA Tournament. They 
wanted to earn their bid in 
February. They didn’t want to 
just beat teams. They wanted to 
bury them.

And while Michigan wasn’t 

perfect, it started to turn heads, 
and quickly.

The Wolverines won the Great 

Lakes Invitational and lost just 
three games through Jan. 27. 
They swept Penn State on the 
season, outscoring the Nittany 
Lions, 33-11. Freshman forward 
Kyle Connor and junior forwards 
JT Compher and Tyler Motte 
emerged as a first line that could 
be the engine behind Michigan’s 
postseason push.

Then it all culminated in a 

rematch of the 2015 Big Ten 
Tournament championship — 
only this time, the script had 
been flipped.

The Wolverines had their 

NCAA Tournament bid in 
hand before the puck dropped 
Saturday. Minnesota was on 
the wrong side of the bubble, 
and Michigan was playing for 
reparation. The Golden Gophers 
were playing for survival.

And just like the season before, 

the team in desperate need of a 

win had a nail hammered firmly 
into its coffin.

“I wouldn’t say it was a chip 

(on our shoulder),” Compher said. 
“But I think that we had teams 
— we called it, ‘We owed these 
teams’ — Penn State being one of 
them, Minnesota (was another).

“We came here to play in big 

games. That’s why you come to 
Michigan, that’s why you want to 
be a part of this tradition.”

Compher was right; the 

Wolverines “owed them.” But 
that would be an understatement.

Minnesota and Penn State 

weren’t just teams Michigan had 
lost to. They were two teams 
that had begun to write the 
Wolverines’ legacy for them. 
They were two teams responsible 
for piling the pressure onto 

Michigan’s shoulders. They were 
two teams that continued the 
wrong streak.

But this past weekend, the 

Wolverines made a statement. 
They dominated Penn State. 
Then they finally won the close 
game they had lost for the 
previous three years. For the first 
time in what felt like forever, 
Michigan sent another team to a 
press conference with bloodshot 
eyes and buried its demons 
somewhere deep in Xcel Energy 
Center. It ended another team’s 
season, and now the Wolverines 
are back where they were, where 
they’re supposed to be. And 
not even that provides enough 
satisfaction.

“We know the group we 

have in that room, though, that 

this isn’t enough,” Racine said 
Sunday. “We need to go further, 
so we’re just trying to stay in the 
moment, be humble and keep 
working hard and try to get past 
this (round).”

It’s only fitting that Racine is 

the man to push the boundaries 
of what this team defines as 
success.

After all, he was the man in net 

when Notre Dame ended the old 
streak — the same one he’s been 
measured by his entire career.

Now, he’ll be between the 

pipes against the Fighting Irish 
in Cincinnati.

There will be no red carpet 

waiting that night.

If the Wolverines are really 

back, they’ll make sure Notre 
Dame has no chance to see one.

Erik Bakich has stressed how 
important consistency is for a 
game as volatile as baseball.

In 
its 
three-game 
series 

against No. 19 Oklahoma State 
(13-7), 
Bakich’s 
team 
was 

consistent, but for all of the 
wrong reasons. Despite picking 
up a win in Sunday’s game 
to avoid getting swept, the 
23rd-ranked Wolverines (12-
5) struck out 34 times over the 
weekend.

It was Michigan’s pitching 

that once again anchored the 
team in its victory and kept 
the previous two games within 
reach. 
Wolverine 
pitchers 

allowed a total of 11 hits while 
letting up just 13 runs between 
the three contests, typically a 
stat line conducive to winning 
games.

But as was true in its earlier 

season losses, Michigan’s lineup 
struggled to even make contact 
at the plate versus Oklahoma 
State. The 7-8-9 hitters had an 
especially rough weekend, as 
they contributed 15 of the 34 
strikeouts.

The problem was not entirely 

with the bottom end of the 
lineup, though. In Saturday’s 
matchup, 
Cowboy 
pitchers 

fanned 17 batters, and every 
batter struck out at least once.

Bakich 
was 
especially 

astonished 
by 
Oklahoma 

State 
starter 
Trey 
Cobb’s 

performance — he punched 
out 13 batters and allowed one 
run in six innings against the 
Wolverines on Saturday.

“(Cobb) 
was 
throwing 

a 
slider,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“It 

tunneled just like his fastball, 
and when you get a guy who has 
an exploding slider like that, 
it’s really tough to hit. He had a 
great day. A good pitcher had a 
great day.”

Michigan struck out 10 times 

in its final game on Sunday and 
collected 11 runs in its three 
games, but Bakich was reluctant 
to point out any notable high 
points for the offense over the 
entire series.

“I think the easy answer would 

be the inside-the-park home 
run (by designated hitter Drew 
Lugbauer on Saturday),” Bakich 
said. “But there are no offensive 
highlights when you strike out 17 

times and lose the game.”

Currently, 
the 
Wolverines 

rank 66th in batting average 
with a .295 clip. Though that 
puts them in the top quarter of 
Division I baseball teams, they 
are tied for 10th in the Big Ten 
for runs scored.

Michigan players and Bakich 

have shown confidence that 
they can win the Big Ten 
Championship once again, but 
its problems at the plate have 
already 
proven 
costly 
this 

season. They struck out just 5.6 
times per game last year and 
have climbed to 7.1 to begin this 
season.

Bakich gave advice to his 

team how to combat the issue.

“When 
you 
do 
get 
two 

strikes,” Bakich said, “you just 
got to choke up and have the 
mindset that, ‘There’s no way 
I’m not putting the barrel of my 
bat on this ball.’ ”

Cole, McCallum 
taking on leading 
roles as freshmen 

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

For 
the 
Michigan 

men’s 
gymnastics 
team, 

“upperclassman” is almost a 
foreign word this season.

After winning back-to-back 

national titles in 2013 and 
2014, the senior-led roster was 
drained, forcing the team to 
rebuild with younger gymnasts. 
With just four seniors and three 
juniors out of a group of 24, this 
year’s team dynamic is different 
than two years ago — and almost 
any other in the country.

“It’s been a little hard so 

far coming in with all of these 
freshmen,” 
said 
freshman 

Emyre Cole. “We’re definitely 
learning; 
we’ve 
made 
some 

mistakes.”

The team is led by 13 freshmen 

and four sophomores, a recipe 
that has been causing some 
issues for the Wolverines (1-6 
Big Ten, 4-9 overall) this season.

Yet, 
as 
the 
season 
has 

progressed, the athletes stepping 
up the most for Michigan have 
been a pair of freshmen: Cole and 
Anthony McCallum.

“They both got off to a slow 

start,” said Michigan coach 
Kurt Golder. “This is quite 
an 
adjustment 
from 
junior 

programs, (where) you go to 
long competitions where there 
is no support, nobody cheering 
for you, and you have a meet 
every three to four weeks. Now 
you have one every weekend … 
but they’ve been picking it up.”

Throughout the year, both 

McCallum 
and 
Cole 
had 

competed in multiple events 
each meet, with McCallum 
having 
competed 
in 
the 

all-around 
previously. 
But 

Saturday’s meet against Penn 
State marked the first time both 
of them competed in the all-
around.

In his debut performance, 

Cole showed that he had been 
making the progress Golder 
was talking about, narrowly 
finishing in second with a score 
of 86.850. In every event but the 
rings, Cole came in the top five, 
including finishing second in 
the vault only 0.050 points shy 
of first.

McCallum also had a good 

night, finishing third in the 
all-around with a score of 
85.400. Though he was more 
inconsistent than his teammate, 
he also excelled in the vault, 
narrowly beating out Cole to take 
home the crown in the event.

“It’s still strange because 

I didn’t know how much the 
team was going to rely on me,” 
McCallum said. “Now I’m kind 
of comfortable in that position 
(where) the team needs me, and 
hopefully the rest of the team 
can get stronger so I’m not as 
relied on. But I kind of own that 
position now; I think that’s the 
best thing to do in the situation.”

Fortunately for the rest of 

the team, McCallum and Cole 
seem to be peaking at the right 
time. The Wolverines have only 
one more dual meet, against a 
University of Illinois at Chicago 
team 
they 
defeated 
earlier 

this season, before competing 
in the Big Ten and NCAA 
Championship meets.

And even if this season 

doesn’t 
end 
in 
anything 

special, McCallum’s and Cole’s 
early-learned 
expertise 
and 

leadership should be beneficial 
down the road.

“Now that we’re in March, 

they’re finally in shape,” said 
senior Nolan Novak. “They’re 
getting the groove of things. 
They’ve stepped up and kind 
of fit the shoes of being an all-
arounder already, so that will 
bode well for them when they’re 
seniors.”

Michigan readying for San Diego

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has reached the 
Sweet Sixteen 
of the Women’s 
National 
Invitational 
Tournament, 
but 
anything 

less 
than 
a 

championship 
will 
leave 
a 

bad taste in the 
Wolverines’ 
mouth.

On 
paper, 

Michigan (9-9 
Big Ten, 19-13 
overall) 
is 

talented enough to advance to the 
WNIT Final Four and possibly 
run the table to hang a banner in 
Crisler Center. But before they 
can start thinking about that, 
the Wolverines must get past San 
Diego on Tuesday at 7 p.m. at 
Crisler.

The 
Toreros 
(13-5 
West 

Coast Conference, 25-7 overall) 
got to this point by defeating 
Michigan’s 
Big 
Ten 
foe 

Northwestern and IUPUI by four 
and 11, respectively. Against the 
Wildcats, San Diego had control 
for the most of the game even 
though they were away from 
home. The Toreros led by as 
much as 20 in the fourth quarter, 
but allowed Northwestern to 
cut the deficit to as little as two 
before pulling out a victory. After 
a tie ballgame at the half facing 
the Jaguars, San Diego pulled 
away and didn’t look back.

When the Wolverines traveled 

to Evanston to face the Wildcats, 
Michigan squeezed out a five-
point victory. In that matchup, 
the Wolverines surrendered 23 
turnovers 
that 
Northwestern 

turned 
into 
30 
points. 
If 

Michigan had taken better care 
of the ball, the margin of victory 
would have been much larger. 
Lately, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 

been valuing their possessions. 

After surrendering 16 turnovers 
in the first round of the WNIT 
against Wright State, Michigan 
had just seven turnovers in the 
next round against Bucknell. The 
Wolverines will have to be even 
more careful Tuesday night.

“San Diego is a real tough 

team, they’ve had a tremendous 
season,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico on her weekly 
radio appearance with WTKA. 
“They’re playing exceptionally 
well. 
They’ve 
been 
in 
the 

Midwest for the duration of the 
WNIT.

“They’re 
a 
great, 
great 

defensive 
team, 
and 
they’re 

gonna change the pressure on 
us. They’re really going to get up 
and force turnovers, they forced 
25 turnovers the other night. 
They’re gonna be scrappy and all 
over the place.”

Along with cutting down on 

turnovers, the stellar play of 
junior guard Siera Thompson 

has also been a boost for the 
Wolverines. 
Thompson 
is 

known as a lockdown defender, 
guarding each team’s respective 
best player. But in the WNIT, 
Thompson has topped her career 
high in points in both games with 
19 and 20, respectively.

Against 
the 
Toreros, 

Thompson will likely be given 
the task of defending guard 
Malina Hood, who averages 18.5 
points per game. Malina’s twin 
sister, Maya, is second in scoring 
for San Diego with a 14.4 average. 
With the twins leading the way, 
the Toreros have lost all but one 
game by single digits.

San Diego is strong in guard 

presence, 
but 
lacks 
height, 

priming 
Michigan 
freshman 

center Hallie Thome to have 
another standout performance. 
Against Bucknell, Thome tallied 
24 
points 
and 
four 
blocks. 

With San Diego’s tallest player 
standing at 6-foot-2, Thome’s 

6-foot-5 
frame 
and 
shifty 

footwork could allow her to pad 
the stat sheet in the paint. Her 
scoring has been instrumental in 
the Wolverines’ 81- and 95-point 
displays so far in the WNIT.

“If we can continue to score 

like we have the last couple 
games, that’ll put us in great 
shape,” Barnes Arico said.

Michigan’s best seasons may 

lie in the future with younger 
players continuing to develop and 
another ranked recruiting class 
coming in next season, but the 
seniors are still the focus of this 
year’s Wolverines. They want to 
send guards Madison Ristovski 
and Halle Wangler and forward 
Kelsey Mitchell off with a WNIT 
championship.

It wouldn’t be as prestigious as 

the NCAA Tournament bid that 
Michigan wanted, but the WNIT 
is an opportunity to finish the 
season the way the Wolverines 
started it — with a win.

Wolverines’ ‘D’ 
sees resurgence

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Writer

Nearly three weeks ago, the 

state of the Michigan hockey 
team was in flux.

Prior to the Ohio State series, 

the Wolverines had only trended 
upward. Senior netminder Steve 
Racine was playing his best 
hockey of his life. The feared 
CCM line — freshman Kyle 
Connor and juniors JT Compher 
and Tyler Motte — was scoring 
endless goals and the defense 
was finally erasing the kinks 
that plagued it in past years.

Then came the series against 

the Buckeyes.

The Wolverines traveled to 

Columbus, eager to continue 
their strong season, but couldn’t 
forge ahead. They let in 13 goals 
and were swept — one coach 
said prior to the series that 
Michigan’s goal was to limit 
the 
Buckeyes 

to five goals on 
the weekend. It 
was a giant step 
backward, and 
the team was 
playing a type 
of hockey that 
you don’t want 
to play with the 
postseason just 
weeks away.

But it didn’t faze them. The 

Wolverines went on to promptly 
sweep Penn State by a margin of 
13-2 before beating the Nittany 
Lions again, 7-1, and Minnesota, 
5-3, to capture the Big Ten 
Tournament championship.

If you ask the team what 

changed 
defensively, 
they’ll 

tell you it was a whole-team 
effort. Every player became 
accountable: 
forwards, 

defensemen and Racine.

Starting with the forwards, 

Compher mentioned throughout 
the year that the forwards 
needed to backcheck more. But 
backchecking was all but absent 
in Columbus.

However, 
the 
captain’s 

message rang deep during the 
Big Ten Tournament.

“We won more battles, we 

were harder working, harder to 
play against, especially against 
Minnesota,” 
Compher 
said. 

“Our ‘D’ did a really good job 
gapping up and taking away 
space from their forwards. It 
was probably the hardest our 
team has backchecked all year, 
and it really took away a lot of 
what they were trying to do.”

Added Berenson: “A lot of 

things had to happen and our 
team battled harder as a group. 
But then there were individuals 
who made plays that saved goals, 
which are just as important as 
the individuals who scored goals, 
starting with Racine and then 
(sophomore defenseman) Cutler 
Martin on that two-on-one.”

Berenson 
referenced, 

perhaps, the play of the game. 
And it wasn’t another goal from 
the CCM line. Knotted at three 
midway through the period 

after Michigan let in three 
unanswered goals, Minnesota 
capitalized on a turnover to force 
a two-on-one opportunity. With 
the way the game’s momentum 
was shifting, it felt like the 
Gophers would capitalize.

Instead, 
Martin 
decided 

to challenge the puck-carrier 
head-on, diving toward him 
and knocking the puck toward 
Racine, who scurried the puck 
away from the danger zone.

“I told Marty that it was the 

play of the year for him,” Racine 
said. “It was an awesome play. 
He took a chance and it worked 
out.”

Added 
sophomore 

defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski: 

“We work on two-on-ones a 
lot throughout the week and it 
seems to have paid off. I don’t 
know if that was safest play 
or way to do it, but it was one 
of the plays of the game in my 

opinion.”

Martin’s 

play 
shows 

that 
when 

Michigan 
takes 
chances, 
it 
plays 
its 

best hockey. 
When 
the 

defensemen 
have pinched 

down the boards to keep the 
puck in the offensive zone, more 
goals have occurred.

In the Ohio State series, the 

defensemen got away from that. 
They tried to play to close to home, 
allowing the game come to them 
rather than being the playmaker.

“I think we are buying into 

what is in front of us. We know 
we can make a run,” Werenski 
said. “When we want to, and 
commit to playing defense, we 
can do it. It’s just, as a team, it 
hasn’t been there all season, 
which is a tough pill to swallow 
thinking about what we could’ve 
done earlier in the year.

“I think when you can gap up 

on the other forwards and not 
give them much time to make 
plays, it helps us a lot. It’s been 
nice having our forwards do a 
good job coming back hard and 
it gives us more confidence to 
step up and make plays.”

Then there’s Racine, who has 

looked like a bona fide goaltender 
for the majority of the year, but 
has also suffered through down 
weekends like the one three 
weeks ago in Columbus.

“He didn’t have his best series 

at Ohio State and he was the first 
to admit that,” Compher said. 
“We’re going to help as much as 
possible, and when he gives you 
big saves like the one he had on 
that two-on-one last night, that 
was a game-changer. If he can 
make those saves and we can 
put in our opportunities, then 
we can beat anyone.”

If that’s true, it has to start 

with the forwards backchecking 
hard 
and 
the 
defensemen 

playing aggressive. The rest 
should take care of itself.

“I think we 

are buying into 
what is in front 

of us.”

‘M’ wraps up non-conference play 

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 2 Michigan softball 

team has had a long buildup to 
conference play.

The 

Wolverines 
(21-2) 
have 

traveled across 
the country to 
tournaments 
in 
Florida, 

California 
and 
Kentucky, 

facing 
a 
host 

of 
nationally 

diverse — and 
talented 
— 

opponents, 
including No. 
1 Florida, No. 
7 
Washington, 

No. 11 Florida State, No. 13 
Missouri, No. 14 Oklahoma and 
No. 16 UCLA.

But the team finally returned to 

Ann Arbor last Wednesday to play 
its first home game of the season, 
clobbering Eastern Michigan, 14-1.

Tuesday’s home game against 

Western Michigan represents the 
end of Michigan’s journey to Big 
Ten play.

After 
facing 
the 
Broncos 

(8-12), the Wolverines will begin 
a 23-game conference schedule, 
with the exception of one game 
against 
Central 
Michigan 

sandwiched 
between 
series 

against Maryland and Penn 
State at the end of April.

Michigan’s strong start has been 

boosted by an offense that ranks 
fourth in the nation in scoring and 
10th in batting average.

Its 
pitching, 
however, 
lags 

behind in comparison, with the 
rotation giving up four or more 
runs in five games this season 
and ranking 38th in the nation in 
earned-run average.

For a team with championship 

potential that has been ranked No. 
2 all year — and came in at No. 1 in 
the first RPI rankings of the season 
— the Wolverines haven’t been 
very balanced.

But that seems to be changing.
Over its last eight games, 

Michigan’s pitching staff has 
hurled five shutouts and has 
a combined team earned-run 
average of 0.94.

For junior right-hander Megan 

Betsa, walks have been a thorn in 
her side all season. Currently, she 
has given up more free passes than 
hits.

In her past two starts, she has 

tempered the problem, giving up 
just two walks and tossing what 
was easily her best game of the 
season in her most recent start. 
Betsa threw a complete game 
shutout with 11 strikeouts and no 
walks.

Betsa is building off of an 

All-American season last year, 
and Michigan will need her to 
continue to return to her previous 
excellence if it hopes to experience 
more postseason success.

Sophomore right-hander Tera 

Blanco has bounced back as well. 
In her first start of the season, 
Blanco gave up seven runs (five 
unearned) in an 8-0, run-rule loss 
to No. 1 Florida, but she has since 
thrown two shutouts in her past 

three starts.

Fifth-year senior right-hander 

Sara Driesenga has been the most 
consistent of all the pitchers, 
sporting a gaudy 11-0 record 
with a team-best 2.12 ERA. But 
even she struggled earlier in the 
season, giving up 13 runs in 20.1 
innings pitched at the Mary Nutter 
Collegiate Classic.

Since then, however, she has 

given up only one run in the past 18 
innings she has pitched.

With its staff rounding into 

shape, the Wolverines are an even 
more dangerous team than before. 
Even if pitching alone can’t win 
championships, consistently good 
pitching can only help a team 
with the caliber of offense that 
Michigan has.

“If we can get our pitching to 

consistently keep us in the game, 
our offense has the ability to do 
their part, which is score more 
runs,” Hutchins said. “That’s 
really what we try to stress every 
day with our pitchers to take the 
pressure off them. They don’t have 
to be perfect.”
