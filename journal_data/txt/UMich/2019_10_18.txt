A 
court 
case 
focusing 
on 
Harvard 
University’s 
consideration of race in their 
admissions 
process 
could 
impact 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s future admissions 
policy. On Oct. 1, U.S. District 
Court 
Judge 
Allison 
D. 
Burroughs ruled that Harvard 
University’s admissions policy, 
which accounts for race, did 
not discriminate against Asian 
American 
applications 
and 
would be allowed to stay in 
place. 
Students for Fair Admissions, 
the organization that represents 
a group of Asian-American 
students rejected by Harvard, 
has filed for appeal with the 
First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
If the case reaches the Supreme 
Court and the court rules in 
favor of Harvard University, it 
would reverse precedent and 
result in policy changes for the 
nine states that have banned 
affirmative action. 

The Independent Community 
Police Oversight Commission 
met Thursday night to hold 
elections 
for 
leadership 
positions. Former acting Chair 
Commissioner Lisa Jackson and 
Former Commissioner Frances 
Todoro-Hargreaves 
were 
elected as Chair and Vice-Chair, 
respectively. 
The 
commissioners 
also 
passed a resolution to establish 
social 
media 
platforms 
and 
discussed 
the 
budget 
and 
workplan for the commission in 
the 2020 fiscal year. There were 
eight commissioners and two 
non-voting county liaisons in 
attendance; two commissioners 
were absent and one seat is 
currently vacant.
The 
Police 
Oversight 
Commission was founded in 
March in order to increase 
transparency in the Ann Arbor 
Police Department. 

The 
2019 
Hanes 
Walton 
Jr. lecture featured Dianne 
Pinderhughes, political science 
and Africana studies professor 
at the University of Notre 
Dame. About 50 people were 
in attendance for the event 
Thursday afternoon.

The lecture is given annually 
in honor of the late Hanes 
Walton Jr., former political 
science 
professor 
at 
the 
University of Michigan. 
Pinderhughes gave a lecture 
titled “Racial Dynamics in the 
American Context: A Second 
Century of Civil Rights and 
Protest” 
and 
covered 
the 
historical 
progression 
of 
racial dynamics in relation to 

governmental structures in the 
United States. She discussed 
the development of U.S. racial 
politics, Black politics after civil 
rights reform, the 2018 midterm 
election and the unexpected 
politics surrounding the Obama 
and Trump presidencies.
Citing 
historian 
Rayford 
Logan, 
Pinderhughes 
said 
the 
19th 
to 
20th 
century 
represented the “nadir,” or 

lowest point for Black political 
development 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
“...After the Civil War, after 
abolition, African Americans 
had begun to exercise some 
power. They’d been able to 
register to vote. They’d been 
able 
to 
elect 
numbers 
of 
Blacks to office at the local 
level and the national level,” 
Pinderhughes said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Thirty-five people came out 
to Weill Hall to hear media 
entrepreneur 
Mike 
Muse 
talk about the intersection 
between public policy and 
pop culture Thursday. Muse 
is the host of radio show “The 
Mike Muse Show,” co-host of 
“Sway in the Morning” and 
is also an ABC News political 
contributor. Throughout the 
event, he analyzed politics 
and pop culture topics such as 
film, environment, music and 
sports.
Muse 
started 
the 
conversation 
by 
talking 
about film and television, 
specifically the movies “When 
They See Us,” “The Kill Team” 
and 
the 
“Dave 
Chapelle” 
series. He discussed their 
effectiveness 
in 
creating 
conversation by addressing 
topics that are controversial 
and come off as offensive. He 
also said film can illustrate 
stories that have been hard for 
others to understand, which 
was the case for “When They 
See Us.”
“We heard the story of the 
‘Central Park Five,’ but we 
never got a chance to witness 
it for those who may have been 
too young, including myself,” 
Muse said. “To see it on the 
big screen, it takes on a whole 
new narrative. When you see 

it, you can feel it. The policies, 
law, the courtroom become 
humans, and then it becomes 
lives at stake. You can see how 
lives are impacted, so when 
you see it on the big screen 
that allows you to say: ‘OK, 
how can we change things?’”
Before his media work, 
Muse 
was 
an 
industrial 
engineer. 
He 
said 
his 
engineering background led 
to an opportunity to serve as 

a Google NextGen Tech Policy 
Fellow. 
The 
intersection 
between 
technology 
and 
climate change came into 
the 
conversation 
when 
Muse talked about his time 
at Formula E, a car race 
consisting entirely of electric 
cars. 
“These (Formula E workers) 
are climate fanatics and they 
wanted to make a better 
impact on the world, but it 

was a marketing strategy,” 
Muse said. “Businesses are 
not rocking with electric cars 
and hybrid vehicles because 
it’s not sexy enough. 
They don’t see them as 
strong cars with the ability to 
go fast. So, what they decided 
to do was create an entire 
racing industry to impact 
climate, and I thought that 
was the coolest thing.”

The University of Michigan 
Board of Regents approved a 
number 
of 
finance 
property 
agreements, 
listened 
to 
an 
investment 
and 
endowment 
report and appointed Valeria 
Bertacco, 
associate 
professor 
of electrical engineering and 
computer science in the College 
of Engineering, as vice provost 
for engaged learning on the Ann 
Arbor campus during a meeting 
in the Northbank Center Grand 
Ballroom on the University’s Flint 
campus Thursday afternoon.
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel opened the meeting 
by 
congratulating 
Elizabeth 
Anderson, 
professor 
of 
philosophy at the University’s 
Ann Arbor campus, for being 
named a 2019 MacArthur finalist. 
The MacArthur fellowship, also 
known as a “genius grant,” awards 
people of “outstanding talent” 
$625,000 to pursue independent 
projects. 
Schlissel also mentioned the 
recent announcement that the 
University’s Ann Arbor campus 
will host a presidential debate 
in October 2020, saying he and 
other University officials will 
work to plan debate watch parties 
and other activities in the months 
before the debate takes place. 
“This 
event 
places 
the 
University and state squarely 

at the center of next year’s 
presidential election,” Schlissel 
said. “It provides a tremendous 
opportunity 
for 
our 
entire 
community to do as we always 
have, which is to lead the way 
examining major national issues 
while advancing democracy in 
the United States.”
Schlissel told the board the 
University 
began 
to 
collect 
feedback from the community 
on their draft policy in the 
Standard Practice Guide relating 
to sexual misconduct. According 
to Schlissel, the external review 
committee that first evaluated 
the 
University 
recommended 
they create a single policy that 
could apply to all sectors of the 
University, 
including 
faculty, 
staff and students on all three 
campuses. 
“Though the procedures for 
different groups will remain 
distinct, 
we 
are 
seeking 
community input on the draft 
policy,” Schlissel said. 
Erik 
Lundberg, 
the 
chief 
investment 
officer 
at 
the 
University, then presented the 
latest investment and endowment 
report for the three campuses. 
Lundberg spoke about the state 
of the University’s investments 
and said while the University 
is ranked among the top 10 
schools based on the size of its 
endowment, it is ranked lower 
in terms of endowment per 
student.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Institute 
for 
Social Research hosted Eric 
Hemenway, an Anishinaabe/
Odawa from Cross Village, 
Mich., on Thursday morning 
to speak about the history, 
culture and repatriation of 
the 
Anishinaabek 
Odawa 
tribe. 
About 
35 
students, 
faculty and staff attended the 
event.
Hemenway is the director 
of 
Repatriation, 
Archives 
and Records for the Little 
Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa 
Indian, a federally recognized 
tribe in northern Michigan. 
He has done extensive work 
with the repatriation of Native 
American 
remains 
under 

the Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation 
Act by working with museums 
and 
universities, 
and 
has 
brought roughly 300 people 
back 
to 
their 
homelands, 
according to his website. 
Hemenway 
began 
by 
acknowledging the Odawa, 
Ojibwe, 
and 
Bodewadmi 
tribes who are indigenous to 
the land that the University 
currently 
resides 
on. 
He 
explained how his stories 
about culture and heritage 
may not apply to his entire 
tribe, but rather his own 
experiences and traditions 
growing 
up 
in 
northern 
Michigan as an Anishinaabe/
Odawa.
“I always say you could 
have 10 Natives up here, and 
they can give you 10 different 

perspectives 
and 
answers, 
and 
they’re 
all 
correct,” 
Hemenway 
said. 
“So, 
I’m 
not speaking on behalf of all 
Odawa, I’m not speaking on 
behalf of all Anishinaabek, 
I’m speaking on behalf of 
myself and everything I’ve 
learned on my time here.”
Hemenway 
spoke 
about 
repatriation, 
the 
idea 
of 
returning 
someone 
or 
something back to their home 
land, and how it connects with 
the land where Natives buried 
their ancestors. As a historian, 
Hemenway 
explained 
how 
hundreds of thousands of 
Native 
Americans 
were 
forcibly removed from their 
native lands.
“When things were very 
tumultuous, and we were 
forced with removal, that 
connection 
with 
their 
heritage, their history and 
their culture is severed,” 
Hemenway said. “One of 
the main things that kept 
us in our homelands was 
our ancestors.”
The idea of home is 
deeply rooted in Native 
culture, 
Hemenway 
explained. 
Hemenway 
shared 
his 
experience 
of reading letters Native 
leaders 
wrote 
to 
the 
federal government 200 
years ago explaining the 
necessity of staying on the 
land of their ancestors.
“Reading these letters 
from 
200 
years 
ago 
has 
been 
rewarding, 
impactful and very deep,” 
Hemenway said. “When 
you’re being forced with 
this choice of ‘Do I leave 
my land? What do I do to 
stay home?’ I’m thinking 
of my grandfather, my 
grandmother, my dad, my 
mother, and you have to 
be there with them. So 
that idea and feeling of 

home goes beyond a house. It 
goes beyond this area I visit 
occasionally. It’s literally my 
DNA, my roots. My ancestors 
are in this land, and that’s why 
I consider this my anchor.”
Hemenway 
also 
shared 
his own family’s meaningful 
traditions 
for 
a 
yearly 
ceremony 
during 
the 
fall 
called the Ghost Suppers. 
Ever since he was a child, 
Hemenway’s 
family 
has 
participated in the ceremony, 
which included many home-
cooked 
dishes, 
Hemenway 
said. Eating at least one bite of 
every single dish is part of the 
ceremony because it signifies 
that someone on “the other 
side” — an ancestor who has 
passed away — is also eating. 
“We open the house to not 
just our immediate family, but 
to anybody. If you hear about 
the supper you’re invited,” 
Hemenway said. “That’s how 
it works, it’s the hospitality … 
It’s these activities that show 
this continuity of connection 
and culture and beliefs in 
a home. And it would be 
very, very difficult to have 
this connection if I was in 
(somewhere 
like) 
Kansas. 
You could do it, but it doesn’t 
have the impact, doesn’t have 
the power that it does when 
you’re going to the grave 
of your grandmother, and 
putting a reef on, and then the 
next day, feeding her.”
LSA sophomore Lindsey 
Smith attended the event 
after hearing about it from 
sociology professor Arland 
Thornton, who coordinated 
the event. Smith also works in 
a museum studies class that 
focuses on repatriations, and 
was interested to hear more 
about Hemenway’s work.

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
I think we should lower the voting age to 16, which would make 
every American high school a hotbed of political activity,” Yang said. 
“And the fact is you can pay taxes at 16 - you’re going to be on this earth 
for longer so you should have a say in the future.”

Andrew Yang, Democratic Presidential Candidate, told The Daily in an interview after the Democratic Debates in Ohio.

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore Liat 
Weinstein discussed attending a court hearing that led to 14-year-
old Bobby Reyes discontinuation of life support at Michigan 
Medicine.

“It was difficult because it was really tragic. [The judge said ] it was 
impossible for the judge to do anything but dismiss the case, and so 
when he did dismiss the case, everyone started crying because that 
meant Michigan Medicine had the legal right to take the boy off life 
support. It was definitely difficult to know how to reach out, if at all, 
and how to be sensitive about that.”

Liat Weinstein, Daily Staff Reporter

For the state of Michigan, 
this would mean the University 
could 
resume 
its 
previous 
practice 
of 
affirmative 
action and the use of race in 
admissions decisions. 
The lawsuit was filed in 
November 2014, claiming that 
the practice of racial balancing, 
commonly known as affirmative 
action, in Harvard’s admissions 
process was discriminatory. 
In Burroughs’ conclusion, 
she described her belief that 
racial balance positively affects 
Harvard University’s student 
body and explains why she 
upheld their affirmative action 
policy. 
“(Students) will have the 
opportunity 
to 
know 
and 
understand one another beyond 
race, 
as 
whole 
individuals 
with 
unique 
histories 
and 
experiences,” Burroughs wrote. 
“Until we (can all do that), race 
conscious admissions programs 
that survive strict scrutiny 
will have an important place 
in society and help ensure that 
colleges and universities can 
offer 
a 
diverse 
atmosphere 
that 
fosters 
learning, 
improves 
scholarship, 
and 
encourages mutual respect and 
understanding.” 
Rob Sellers, the University’s 
vice provost for equity and 
inclusion and chief diversity 
officer, 
commented 
on 
the 
Harvard admissions case and 
how it could ultimately affect 
the University in an email 
statement to The Daily. 
 “The decision is important 
in reaffirming the compelling 
nature of [the] benefits [of 
diversity] -- an argument that U 
of M successfully championed 
before the Supreme Court in 
the Grutter and Gratz decisions 
-- but ultimately does not affect 
our admissions practices, as 
we remain subject to Prop 2,” 
Sellers wrote. “On a national 
level, 
the 
case’s 
ultimate 
impact is not yet clear: SFFA 
has reportedly already said it 
will appeal to the First Circuit, 
and to the Supreme Court if 
necessary. 
LSA senior James Lee, the 
advocacy chair of United Asian 
American 
Organizations, 
similarly 
expressed 
that 

affirmative action would benefit 
the University.
“I think we very much need 
it,” Lee said. “I think affirmative 
action 
is 
a 
good 
thing, 
inherently. It gives people the 
channels and avenues that they 
historically weren’t given into 
the top tier elite universities. So 
I guess as a blanket statement, 
yes, we do support affirmative 
action.” 
In 
contrast 
to 
Harvard 
University, the University of 
Michigan has not considered 
race as a part of the admissions 
process since 2006. This change 
occurred after a statewide ballot 
initiative when the Proposal 
2 amendment, which banned 
the use of race in admissions 
in education, was added to the 
state constitution. The Supreme 
Court ruled the amendment 
was constitutional in 2014. 
Following this change, the 
University 
saw 
declines 
in 
the enrollment of minority 
students. To combat this shift, 
the 
University 
established 
programs through The Center 
for 
Educational 
Outreach, 
such as collaborations with 
K-12 
schools 
and 
service 
organizations 
on 
campus. 
University 
administration 
has 
confirmed 
they 
will 
continue to be an affirmative 
action 
employer, 
ensuring 
all individuals have an equal 
opportunity for advancement, 
and 
have 
reaffirmed 
their 
commitment 
to 
diversity, 
implementing 
a 
five-year 
plan for diversity, equity and 
inclusion efforts that began in 
2016. 
Sellers also commented on 
how these programs and the 
University’s 
commitment 
to 
diversity affect students, despite 
not being able to use affirmative 
action in admissions. 
 
“As 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan enters the fourth year 
of its five-year strategic plan for 
diversity, equity and inclusion, 
we continue to make progress 
in transforming the university 
into a place where everyone 
has an equitable opportunity 
to succeed and contribute,” 
Sellers wrote. “These changes 
can be seen and felt throughout 
our 
campus, 
as 
programs, 
practices 
and 
initiatives 
continue to reflect our values 
in making Michigan a more 
diverse, equitable and inclusive 

university.”
Despite 
the 
University’s 
commitment 
to 
diversity, 
Public Policy junior Cydney 
Gardner-Brown said she is one 
of only two Black students in 
her cohort at the Gerald R. Ford 
School of Public Policy. This 
has often forced her to be the 
spokesperson of her race, she 
said.
“Black 
students 
entering 
spaces where they are the racial 
minority 
can 
be 
extremely 
difficult for them to navigate,” 
Gardner-Brown said. “As one 
of the only two Black students 
in the Ford Class of 2021, my 
presence is hyper-visible to my 
classmates and instructors. My 
voice, face and opinions are 
often amplified, whether I want 
them to be or not, because a 
Black perspective is quite rare.” 
She 
thinks 
the 
state 
of 
Michigan’s lack of affirmative 
action 
in 
admissions 
has 
negatively 
impacted 
the 
University and student body. 
“I’ll 
say 
that 
repealing 
(affirmative action) made a 
significant negative impact on 
diversity on campus which is 
harmful to the university as a 
whole,” Gardner-Brown said. 
“Its repeal was a demonstration 
of the Supreme Court’s lack 
of empathy and resolve for 
social reform and of its failure 
to recognize and honor the 
dire need for trailblazers in 
public educational settings to 
help rectify institutionalized 
racism.” 
In Harvard’s case, though 
Burroughs’ ruled in favor of 
the school, she also suggested 
there were ways the admissions 
process could be improved. 
“Notwithstanding the fact 
that 
Harvard’s 
admissions 
program 
survives 
strict 
scrutiny, it is not perfect,” 
Burroughs 
wrote 
in 
her 
decision. 
“The process would likely 
benefit 
from 
conducting 
implicit 
bias 
trainings 
for 
admissions 
officers, 
maintaining clear guidelines 
on the use of race in the 
admissions process … That 
being said, the Court will 
not dismantle a very fine 
admissions 
program 
that 
passes constitutional muster, 
solely because it could do 
better.”

“But with the Plessy v. 
Ferguson decision, with the 
overall 
understanding 
that 
the 
national 
government 
would not be aggressive about 
implementing 
and 
ordering 
and protecting the rights of 
African 
Americans, 
voter 
registration collapsed.”
From 
this 
concept, 
Pinderhughes 
said 
she 
developed her own notion of 
a “contested nadir,” showing 
resistance 
in 
the 
face 
of 
systematic struggle for the 
African-American community. 
The contested nadir represents 
a new resurgence of the civil 
rights movement in the United 
States. 
“This is a kind of optimistic 
future,” 
Pinderhughes 
said. 
“I’m 
arguing 
that 
there 
are challenges — there’s no 
question 
that 
the 
Trump 
administration 
has 
worked 
very hard to undercut all the 
reforms that were being put 
in place over the last 40 to 50 
years — but that there’s enough 
structural changes that make 
this (stable) long term.”
Rackham student Michelle 
Mann, a doctoral candidate 
in history, said she thought 
the 
historical 
comparisons 
throughout the lecture allowed 
for a better understanding of 
racial dynamics in the country.
“I think it’s great,” Mann 
said. 
“I 
appreciated 
the 
comparison of the nadir to 
a new nadir. I think there’s 
definitely something to that. 
You can’t understand where 
you’re at if you don’t know 
where you came from.”
According 
to 
Rackham 
student 
Kamri 
Hudgins, 
connecting 
concepts 
of 
academics 
and 
activism 
is 
effective 
in 
starting 
conversations 
about 
institutional change.
“I think it’s always good 
to bridge the gap between 

academia 
and 
activism,” 
Hudgins 
said. 
“So, 
I 
feel 
like a lot of times when you 
think about people like Ralph 
Bunche — he was a scholar and 
an activist — so when you have 
these people on the ground 
doing the work, the grassroots-
type-thing that are going on, 
it’s good to have things like 
this because you almost need a 
framework to pull from.”
When asked about modern 
movements like Black Lives 
Matter, 
Pinderhughes 
said 
social media has allowed for 
the resurgence of a large-scale 
civil rights movement.
“In a sense, what we’re 
seeing is the full mobilization 
of 
the 
African-American 
community,” 
Pinderhughes 
said. “I think we’re not afraid 
to rise up and take public 
stands about it and protest in 
the streets and do things that 
people wouldn’t necessarily 
think you’d be safe doing all 
the time. Ella Baker used 
to say ‘Strong people don’t 
need strong leaders.’ It seems 
to me that’s where we’re 
seeing community organizing 
and 
grassroots 
organizing 
happening 
frequently, 
and 
those local organizers rising up 
and challenging the police and 
local officials successfully.” 
Hudgins said she appreciated 
the acknowledgment of a new 
era of civil rights in the lecture.
“I thought it was really good 
because you don’t necessarily 
hear people talking about this 
new era of civil rights that we’re 
in. People don’t really frame it 
in that context,” Hudgins said. 
“It’s like everybody knows 
something is going on. There’s 
a lot of movements and a lot 
of talk. There’s a lot of stuff 
happening, but you don’t really 
know what is going on, so I 
think it’s good to even just 
start baseline.”
According to Pinderhughes, 
the 
Obama 
presidency 
and 
subsequent 
Trump 
presidency was the result of an 
overwhelming change in racial 

dynamics and politics in the 
country.
“Decades of work seemed 
to be moving in the right 
direction, 
and 
then 
the 
improbable 
election 
of 
Obama surprised many of the 
most astute observers into 
saying ‘not in my lifetime,’” 
Pinderhughes said. “And then 
Trump was the opposite and 
the inverse of an Obama, and 
yesterday was the 1000th day 
of Trump’s presidency and he 
may have lost his base.”
When asked about how the 
modern ideological landscape 
pertains to the 2020 election, 
Pinderhughes said candidates 
appealing 
to 
“old-school” 
Black politics are struggling 
to garner the attention and 
support 
of 
young 
African-
American voters.
“You could argue that Harris 
and Booker are out there on 
the 
edges,” 
Pinderhughes 
said. “Partly — I’m pointing to 
the race test — how Black are 
they, issue, and then there’s 
the 
issues 
of 
they’re 
not 
liberal enough for the young 
population. I wonder what this 
means in terms of what people’s 
definition is of ‘liberal.’ How 
do we judge that?”
According 
to 
Rackham 
student 
Zoe 
Walker, 
discussions regarding racial 
dynamics 
are 
especially 
important on the U-M campus.
“The University of Michigan 
is still a predominantly white 
campus in the Midwest, so I 
think diversity is going to be an 
ongoing issue and the question 
of civil rights is going to be an 
ongoing issue in a place like 
Michigan, especially in Ann 
Arbor,” Walker said. “Even 
though there’s only 4 percent 
black students here at this 
school, as Prof. Pinderhughes 
was saying race has become a 
national issue and it’s always 
been an issue in national 
politics, 
but 
especially 
in 
the era of Trump it’s going 
to continue to be a national 
conversation.”

Nickxit 
Bhardwaj, 
Flint 
senior and president of the Flint 
campus Student Government, 
also addressed the board about 
issues facing Flint students 
and the ways the University 
should support students across 
the three campuses. Bhardwaj 
urged the board to understand 
the unique challenges that 
many 
Flint 
students 
must 
overcome in order to get an 
education. 
“The story of a University 
of Michigan-Flint student is 
not the same as Ann Arbor, 
Dearborn 
or 
any 
other 
campuses,” Bhardwaj said. “On 
average, most of my student 
peers have two jobs or ... are 
involved in different projects 
or organizations that impact 
student life on campus. On 
top of that, our students have 
multiple 
demands 
on 
their 
time or resources. Many of our 
students are veterans, single 
parents, transfer students or 
nontraditional students over 
the age of 25.”
Bhardwaj asked the board 
to take steps to ensure Flint 
students feel included in the 
University system and have 
access 
to 
resources 
made 
available by the University. 
“So, the question stands: 
How does the University of 
Michigan provide for the needs 
of students in Flint?” Bhardwaj 
said. “How, as a University, do 
we think about the student who 
works two jobs, takes 18 credits, 
struggles 
with 
economic 
disadvantages and still has to 
go home and take care of their 
family? ... We are a different 
campus, and hence we have 
different needs.”
The 
remainder 
of 
the 
meeting was centered around 
23 finance agreements, all of 
which were approved by the 
board. A few of the agreements 
centered around renovations to 
University buildings, including 

a $9 million renovation to the 
A. Alfred Taubman Health Care 
Center. 
The 
public 
commentators 
then took the stage to address 
the Board of Regents and 
Schlissel, 
most 
of 
them 
speaking on behalf of the One 
University Campaign, which 
advocates for equal funding 
on 
the 
University’s 
three 
campuses.
Daniel 
Birchok, 
assistant 
professor of anthropology at 
the U-M Flint, argued some 
of the University’s initiatives 
to promote equality, such as 
the Go Blue Guarantee, don’t 
actually promote equity on all 
three campuses. 
“The public knows that you, 
the regents, have the resources 
to pursue equity for students 
on the U-M Flint and Dearborn 
campuses,” Birchok said. “But 
when you set aside 50 million 
dollars to education innovation 
that does not include the Go 
Blue Guarantee for Flint and 
Dearborn, 
something 
that 
would help our students avoid 
crushing debt, you send a 
message that your interest in 
equity is more about image than 
the well-being of students.”
Birchok 
said 
though 
students who attend U-M Flint 
and Dearborn may not be as 
wealthy as students on the Ann 
Arbor campus, they deserve 
the same level of education and 
opportunities. 
“Our staff, my colleagues 
and our community have not 
given up on a vision of equity 
that includes our students,” 
Birchok said. “Our students 
may not come from the wealth 
that many Ann Arbor students 
do, but they are of equal worth.”
LSA junior Solomon Medintz, 
who writes for The Daily’s 
opinion section, addressed the 
board regarding climate change 
during the public comment 
period. Medintz criticized the 
University for its investment in 
the fossil fuel industry and for 
arresting students for sitting 
in the Fleming Administration 

Building last March. 
“You should stop trying to 
throw 
students 
who 
speak 
out in jail,” Medintz said. “It’s 
absurd 
that 
students 
who 
peacefully sat in last March 
asking to schedule a one-hour 
public meeting with President 
Schlissel 
were 
arrested 
by 
University police and are still 
in and out of court rooms today. 
It is a stain on this University.”
Flint 
senior 
Brooklyn 
Golden, president of the Black 
Student Union, discussed how 
many students at U-M Flint 
are first-generation students 
or low-income students, and 
she said many of them feel like 
the University does not value 
their opinions. She noted the 
negative reputation U-M Flint 
has.
“Unfortunately, many of us 
have the feeling that the faculty 
and staff and administration 
at this University do not hear 
or value what students have 
to say,” Golden said. “There 
are three universities under 
the University of Michigan 
umbrella ... The University of 
Michigan-Flint is commonly 
known 
as 
the 
non-tuition 
university. The majority of our 
students fall under the category 
first-gen, commuter students, 
parents, transfer or low-income 
students.”
Golden concluded by saying 
that while the University says 
it prioritizes diversity, she and 
her peers often feel unwelcome 
on campus. 
“The University makes it a 
point to talk about diversity, 
equity and inclusion on campus 
without seeking any course 
of action to exemplify change 
for students of color,” Golden 
said. “It is a shame that in 2019, 
students of color on this campus 
share experiences of prejudice 
and derogatory remarks and 
actions from faculty, staff and 
even peers. Many students of 
color, 
particularly 
African-
American 
students, 
feel 
unwanted and out of place here 
at this University.”

Muse then transitioned to 
music, where he said catch 
phrases are a big part of pop 
culture, such as Megan Thee 
Stallion’s “Hot Girl Summer.” 
After her song went viral, 
Muse said Stallion went to 
patent a copyright for her 
famous 
phrase 
and 
was 
successful. Muse emphasized 
the importance of Stallion 
being 
able 
to 
obtain 
a 
copyright due to a history of 
Black Americans being unable 
to in the post-slavery era. 
“The patent office, when 
it was created, Black folks 
could never get a patent for 
anything they did during the 
post-slavery 
days 
because 
they 
weren’t 
look 
at 
as 
citizens,” Muse said. “They 
weren’t viewed as having the 
ability to get a patent and they 

were viewed as (not) having 
intellect. So, if you didn’t have 
intellect, then you couldn’t be 
considered a U.S. citizen. And 
considering having intellect 
meant you had a patent.”
Rackham 
student 
Aloka 
Narayanan told The Daily she 
was interested in the policy 
involved in the copyrighting 
of “Hot Girl Summer” and 
other viral catch phrases.
“The copyrighting of ‘Hot 
Girl Summer,’ I didn’t know 
that had been done. I had 
heard about recent efforts to 
copyright ‘Taco Tuesday’ and 
some other big catch phrases,” 
Narayanan said. “I thought 
it was interesting that he 
introduced it as an intellectual 
copyrights issue. What we 
traditional see purely related 
to pop culture and cultural 
norms can also have public 
policy implications that we 
don’t typically think about.”
Muse also talked about 
the 
platform 
that 
sports 

players have and how that 
has turned political in recent 
years. For example, Daryl 
Morey, general manager of 
the Houston Rockets, posted 
in a now deleted tweet a 
statement supporting Hong 
Kong protestors and China 
responded by removing all 
events and coverage of the 
NBA in mainland China. 
“I think sports has a hell 
of a way of really moderating 
our discourse in ways that 
we don’t really think about 
it,” Muse said. “I encourage 
you 
when 
you’re 
doing 
your studies, think tanks, 
internships to think about the 
ways that sports could help 
elevate things you guys care.”
Public Policy senior Ethan 
Ramer told The Daily he 
thought the discussion around 
sports and public policy is

It’s time for sustainable agriculture
F

ollowing 
the 
recent 
climate 
strike 
that 
took place on campus 
last month, I have 
been thinking a lot 
about how I show 
my 
concern 
for 
the future of our 
environment. I was 
proud 
of 
myself 
for 
participating 
in 
an 
event 
that 
only 
resembled 
a microcosm of a 
greater 
movement 
and 
a 
period 
in 
our lives that will become 
a distinguished part of our 
history. Even through that 
sense of pride, I realized 
that this one event doesn’t 
represent my entire lifestyle. 
I should be creating more 
habits to cultivate my own 
consciousness 
about 
the 
quality of our environment. 
How can I truly care about 
our future when I continue 
to practice a lifestyle that is 
leading to its destruction? 
With that being said, I think 
it’s time that all of us — myself 
included — begin to uphold an 
environmentally-conscious 
mindset 
that 
starts 
with 
sustainable agriculture.
Among the many aspects 
of 
our 
daily 
habits 
that 
contribute to climate change, 
our nutrition and appetite are 
major ones. While admittedly 
a habitual and unconscious 
decision, the simple choice 
of consuming meat or not 
consuming meat has become 
one of the most important 
debates influencing the future 
of the food industry today. Not 
only has the food industry been 
where this matter becomes 
important, but it has expanded 
to the public health sector, 
the 
environmental 
sector 
and the agricultural sector. 
Donald 
Scavia, 
University 
of 
Michigan 
professor 
emeritus of environment and 
sustainability, reflected in a 
recent article on the way many 
of our current diets contribute 
to the gradual destruction of 
our surrounding environment. 
For instance, it’s logical 
to connect the increase in 
algal blooms in Michigan and 
throughout the country with 
the strain our diets put on 
agriculture. As we contribute 
to climate change through the 

emission of greenhouse gases, 
we also contribute to these 
destructive algal blooms by 
allowing 
surface 
runoff 
to 
contain 
contaminants such 
as 
fertilizers 
and 
pesticides. 
Surface 
runoff 
poses 
a 
threat because an 
increase 
in 
the 
amount of nutrients 
present in a body 
of 
water, 
coupled 
with the increasing 
temperatures 
of 
those waters, festers large 
amounts of algal growth. Thus, 
it appears that the quality of 
our water resources has been 
hindered both by our demand 
for mass agriculture and by 
our other actions heating our 
planet, which are aspects of 
our lives that we can control.

In an unintentional and 
almost 
oblivious 
way, 
our 
agricultural 
practices 
are 
leading to the destruction of 
the resource that best serves 
them and are jeopardizing the 
functionality of the industry 
as a result. At this point, it’s 
imperative to speculate how 
we can allow the agriculture 
industry to sustain itself and 
realize that it’s going to require 
drastic measures of change 
for self-sustained, deferential 
agriculture to be possible. 
Despite the challenges that 
will surface in this effort, we 
should be aiming to continue 
our mentality of being able 
to 
provide 
for 
ourselves 
as 
a 
civilization 
through 
agriculture, but only if we 
make the alterations necessary 
to make it a sustainable and 
conscious process.
In an effort to promote 
the 
action 
of 
government 
and 
businesses 
to 
make 
agriculture 
sustainable, 

Scavia comments on reducing 
several components of the 
food 
industry 
system 
and 
implementing other techniques 
that reduce the effects of 
contaminants in our natural 
settings. For one, reducing 
the necessity for industrial-
scale corn production would 
eliminate the extent that corn 
production 
contributes 
to 
nutrient pollution. In addition, 
reducing meat consumption 
would reduce the demand for 
corn production, again limiting 
the effects our actions have on 
the environment by controlling 
sources of nutrient pollution. 
Similarly, 
implementing 
a 
two-stage drainage ditch in 
the topography of agricultural 
areas would allow for the 
shape of the land to naturally 
capture 
nutrients 
without 
dispensing 
them 
into 
the 
groundwater 
during 
heavy 
rainfall 
periods. 
Thus, 
we 
should expect that the quality 
of our water resources can be 
salvaged in part by altering the 
demand for several types of 
infrastructure and all aspects 
of our lives and our society 
that we are able to influence 
and control. 
As Scavia concludes, it’s 
more surprising that little to 
no action has taken place to 
mitigate industry’s negative 
impacts on our environment 
than 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
environment is suffering as 
a result. Perhaps we aren’t 
able to contribute immediate 
change to the policies and 
laws we live by, but we have 
to realize that our social 
lives and habits today have 
been sculpted by the reaches 
of 
corporate 
influences 
since the beginning of the 
Industrial Age. We have the 
opportunity to influence the 
companies and the products 
that serve us. Therefore, to 
show them that we are truly 
concerned about sustainable 
practices, it’s crucial that 
we support shifting toward 
agricultural 
sustainability 
by reducing our interest in 
degrading 
processes 
and 
demand corporations become 
the primary proponents in 
creating institutional change.

Why pulling out of Syria is a massive mistake

The Gettysburg of the Trump presidency
F

our months after the 
Union and Confederate 
armies 
receded 
from 
Gettysburg, 
President Abraham 
Lincoln 
boarded 
a 
train 
bound 
for 
the 
southern 
Pennsylvania 
town 
that had witnessed 
the costliest battle 
in American history. 
The following day, 
He 
delivered 
a 
two-minute speech 
that redefined our 
nation’s mission and has since 
come to be counted among 
the greatest speeches of all 
time. But the president did 
not anticipate his Gettysburg 
Address to be as revered as it 
has been, or at least, he did 
not believe his words could 
ever match the sacrifice made 
by the Union soldiers four 
months prior. “The world will 
little note, nor long remember 
what we say here,” Lincoln 
said. “But it can never forget 
what they did here.”
Lincoln, 
of 
course, 
was 
only half right. America did 
note and does remember what 
was said on that Thursday in 
November in Gettysburg. 
There are few times in 
American history when the 
words of our leaders have 
become 
so 
entrenched 
in 
our national consciousness. 
Our collective remembrance 
of these times is usually 
associated 
with 
significant 
moments in American history. 
The words of the Declaration 
of Independence, for instance, 
encapsulate 
the 
zeitgeist 
of 
Revolutionary 
America. 
The 
immortal 
reassurance 
of 
FDR’s 
first 
inaugural 
address — “the only thing 
we have to fear is fear itself” 
— reflects the uncertainty 
Americans felt during the 
Great Depression. Unlike in 
November 1863, America is 
not engaged in a Civil War of 
cannons and rifles — but we 
are most definitely engaged in 
a civil war over our national 
character. 
We are quickly arriving 
at one of these momentous 
junctures. 
As 
House 
Democrats 
promote 
impeaching President Donald 
Trump — and justly so — two 
realities are clear: In the event 
of impeachment, all of America 

is curious as to what Congress 
will say, and posterity will 
most definitely applaud or 
condemn them for 
what they do.
As 
much 
as 
Trump 
and 
his 
loyal 
Republican 
minions 
wish 
to 
discredit 
the 
impeachment 
inquiry, the drama 
is 
no 
trumped-
up 
theater. 
Our 
president 
attempted 
to 
persuade 
a 
foreign 
government to investigate a 
political rival for personal 
gain. It was against the law, 
and if unpunished, it puts 
the integrity of American 
democracy in peril.

By no means was Trump’s 
solicitation of the Ukrainian 
government 
to 
investigate 
former Vice President Joe 
Biden and his son appropriate 
or 
acceptable. 
Even 
Fox 
News’s 
Tucker 
Carlson, 
a 
long-time cheerleader for the 
president, 
recognized 
the 
severity of Trump’s offense. 
“Some 
Republicans 
are 
trying,” Carlson wrote with 
Daily Caller co-founder Neil 
Patel, “but there’s no way to 
spin this as a good idea.” 
House 
Democrats, 
who 
launched 
an 
impeachment 
inquiry after news of the 
Ukraine 
scandal 
broke, 
certainly agree. Unfortunately 
for 
the 
president, 
impeachment 
resides 
entirely within their control: 
Impeaching 
the 
president 
only requires votes from a 
majority of the House, which 
the Democrats hold 234-197. 
After his impeachment on the 
House’s charges, the president 
would then be tried by the 
Senate. To convict Trump 
and thereby remove him from 

office would require 67 Senate 
votes. 
Given 
the 
current 
partisan composition of the 
Senate, a conviction would 
necessitate 
20 
Republican 
defections.
According to an Oct. 3 
USA 
Today 
poll, 
only 
17 
percent of Republicans favor 
impeachment. 
Let’s pretend, for a moment, 
that every Senate Democrat 
were to vote to convict the 
president; that’s 47 of the 
necessary 67 votes. If the 
way Senate Republicans vote 
roughly 
reflects 
public 
opinion, 17 percent of the 
GOP’s 53 Senate seats would 
bring in nine more votes for 
conviction. The final tally 
would be 56 votes in favor 
of conviction to 44 against; 
the Trump presidency would 
survive by the grace of 11 
Republican senators.
But that simulation assumes 
Republican 
voting 
would 
follow public opinion (it very 
well may not), and that public 
opinion won’t be different 
come a Senate trial (it very 
well may). It also ignores the 
possibility, 
however 
slim, 
that Republican senators — 
however deferential to the 
president in the past — may not 
defend him from conviction. 
As CNN’s Frida Ghitis reports, 
“Former Republican Senator 
Jeff Flake said if the vote were 
private, at least 35 Republican 
Senators” would vote to convict 
the president — well over the 
20 defections necessary for a 
two-thirds majority.
Flake’s implication is rather 
upsetting: Because America 
will 
know 
how 
individual 
senators voted, a good deal of 
Republicans — perhaps enough 
to save Trump — will vote to 
acquit despite their better 
judgement. A principled stand 
against our criminal-in-chief 
will fail out of Republican 
cowardice.
The Senate would do well 
to remember that this could 
potentially be the Gettysburg 
of the Trump presidency and 
perhaps even the era. In the 
event of impeachment, the 
bitterly judgmental eyes of 
history will fall upon them, 
and the country will note and 
long remember what they did.

We are quickly 
arriving at one of 
these momentus 
junctures

I

n 
early 
October, 
President Donald Trump 
announced his plan to 
call back troops from northern 
Syria. This was immediately 
followed by Turkey invading 
Syria. Trump claimed he was 
completing 
his 
campaign 
promise of bringing home our 
troops and that “great nations 
do not fight endless wars.” 
While his base will see this 
as him fulfilling a campaign 
promise — which he is — 
I view this as a colossal 
mistake. 
The Middle East is known 
as one of the most unstable 
regions in the world. It has 
been plagued by war and 
chaos for the entirety of the 
21st century. By removing 
our troops from the area and 
allowing the Turkish forces 
to invade, the chaos in Syria 
would increase immensely. 
A nation that has been torn 
apart by an ongoing civil 
war cannot handle a Turkish 
invasion. David Ignatius, a 
Washington Post columnist 
tweeted that “a bad situation 
in Northeast Syria is about 
to get much worse...The US 
will do nothing.” While I am 
typically one to say that the 
United States should not have 
to be the world’s policeman, in 
this case, I believe there is no 
choice. By leaving the region, 
we are leaving our Kurdish 
allies 
in 
Syria 
vulnerable 
to the Turkish forces. The 
Kurds 
were 
instrumental 
in helping us defeat and 
quell the presence of ISIS in 
Syria. They were the boots 
on the ground that helped 
us tackle one of the world’s 
most 
dangerous 
terrorist 
organizations. Nikki Haley, 
the 
former 
United 
States 

ambassador to the United 
Nations under Trump, said it 
best when she tweeted, “We 
must always have the backs of 
our allies, if we expect them 
to have our back. The Kurds 
were instrumental in our 
successful fight against ISIS 
in Syria. Leaving them to die 
is a big mistake.” If we allow 
our Kurdish allies to die, 
why would any of our other 
allies trust us to stand up 
for them? Trump is not only 
throwing Syria, specifically 

Syrian Kurds, into a war with 
Turkey, but he is also showing 
our allies around the world 
that we don’t care about 
them. It’s a very dangerous 
game to play. In a world as 
interconnected as ours has 
become, it is vital to make 
sure that we keep strong ties 
with our allies in the event of 
an emergency, or even worse, 
a war.
Even 
Republicans 
are 
lashing out at Trump. Senate 
Majority 
Leader 
Mitch 
McConnell was critical of the 
president’s decision, stating, 
“A precipitous withdrawal of 
U.S. forces from Syria would 
only benefit Russia, Iran, and 
the Assad regime. … I urge 
the 
President 
to 
exercise 
American leadership to keep 

together our multinational 
coalition 
to 
defeat 
ISIS 
and 
prevent 
significant 
conflict between our NATO 
ally Turkey and our local 
Syrian 
counterterrorism 
partners.” It is unusual to 
see top Republicans, such as 
McConnell, criticize Trump. 
Despite the many issues I 
have with McConnell, he is 
completely right. In no way 
would pulling out of Syria 
benefit the U.S. It would 
only help Russia and other 
disruptors in the area, like 
Iran. Leaving Syria allows for 
hostile nations to influence 
the region and create more 
chaos. Russia knows that a 
war with the U.S. would end 
in catastrophic loss for both 
sides, but with the U.S. out 
of Syria, they will be able to 
assist the Turks in taking over 
the region and killing Kurdish 
allies. There is no reason for 
Russia to be fearful with the 
U.S. gone. 
I believe that Trump needs 
to reconsider his stance on 
pulling out of Syria. This could 
be far worse for his campaign 
than not bringing home the 
troops. The aftermath of what 
will happen in Syria will be a 
permanent stain, among many 
other things, on his foreign 
policy resume as president. 
Our allies will have less faith 
in us, and our word will mean 
nothing. The next time we 
make a promise to an ally they 
will take it with a grain of salt 
because of our actions in Syria. 
It will result in countless lives 
of allies lost and will throw 
the Middle East further into a 
downward spiral.

The alias Blood Orange is etched in Dev 
Hynes’s discography. He does embrace other 
noms de plume, though, and assigns each to a 
signature style. But “Lightspeed Champion,” the 
spacy, genre-defying brand that carved a delicate 
niche in the R&B and soul game, never gained 
the traction that Blood Orange has. The latter’s 
dreamy, sometimes melancholic synth-pop has 
given Hynes the recognition he deserves from 
artists Empress Of, Carly Rae Jepsen and A$AP 
Rocky. And since the release of Negro Swan last 
fall, Hynes has been on a creative streak, releasing 
an EP Angel’s Pulse this summer and Fields last 
Friday. 
Fields is a significant departure from any work 
previously released. A classical music album, it’s 
published under Hynes’s official name alongside 
Third Coast Percussion. Hynes composed all the 
music in a digital audio workstation and sent the 
recordings and sheet music to the members of 
Third Coast Percussion to arrange and orchestrate 
for their own instruments. “This was the first 
time I’ve written music that I’ve never played, 
and I love that,” Hynes said in a press release. 
“It’s something I’ve always been striving to get to. 
Seeing what Third Coast Percussion had done with 
these pieces was magical.” This relationship is 
symbiotic, with Third Coast Percussion partaking 
in the collaborative energy and increasing the 
potential to reach new groups of people. 
An 11-song-suite titled “For All Its Fury” gives 
way to “Perfectly Voiceless” and “There Was 
Nothing,” the two final tracks on the album that 
each individually span more than ten minutes. The 
songs of the suite have been regularly performed 
live along with “Perfectly Voiceless,” which was 
intended as a musical 
interlude. 
Despite the new 
packaging, the album 
doesn’t stray too far 
from the conventions 
of a Blood Orange 
album. 
Within 
its 
dreamy 
membrane 
are 
songs 
that 
reach for particular 
emotions 
within 
us, 
striking 
the 
good and the bad 
in 
equal 
measure. 
A 
contemplative 

aura radiates throughout the project as one song 
leads to another, especially within the “For All 
the Fury” suite. The songs are characteristically 
sparse and embody a minimalistic appeal, keys 
and flutes beckoning in a new emotion the way 
synths generally would in a Hynes album. At 
its core, this album, especially within the suite, 
strives to tell a story. 
Intro track “Reach” is sheer. It wades in a pattern 
of sparse glockenspiel and sharp xylophones 
that loop over a subdued, humming percussion 
that slowly gives way to plinking bells. There’s 
a wistful, nostalgic energy as the song gently 
invites listeners to follow along in the eleven track 
journey. Conversely, its follow-up “Blur” conveys a 
somber side. The title is fitting, as a hazy buzz that 
revs with only a few chimes to offset the tension 
dominates the track. This general pattern of 
zigzagging from serenity to anxiety develops the 
album track by track. It triggers and blends both 
emotions well, most notably in “Curl,” a brief track 
with a background sound akin to a car trudging 
through the snow. All of this culminates at the end 
of the suite with eponymous “Fields.” It traverses 
effortlessly through xylophone and glockenspiel 
based choruses that build over one another. In its 
last stretch, a chaotic rhythm with too many beats 
at once — a fascinating conundrum, given the 
minimalist appeal of the entire album. 
Concluding with “Perfectly Voiceless” and 
“There was Nothing” is questionable. The tracks 
are undeniable standouts, especially the former, 
but they operate on a different plane than the very 
cohesive “For All Its Fury” and keenly differentiate 
themselves with their combined 23-minute length. 
Though they borrow similar elements from the 
suite, they’re more lavish and stretch themselves 
over longer schemes like a slow burn. 
As an introductory project between Dev Hynes 
and Third Coast Percussion, Fields functions as 
a stunning mashup 
between forces. The 
album 
effortlessly 
embraces the magic 
of 
both 
artists 
in 
its 
captivating 
portrayal of emotions 
and 
diligent 
instrumentals. 
Despite 
its 
sparse 
appeal, 
this 
burgeoning 
branching-off 
from convention is 
rich, 
exciting 
and 
addictive.

ALBUM REVIEW

The CW’s new teen mystery series “Nancy Drew” is 
far more CW than it is Nancy Drew. Despite the similar 
character names and occasional cheeky references to the 
original book series’s titles, there is not much carrying the 
iconic girl detective’s legacy in this gritty reboot.
The series premiere of “Nancy Drew” opens on the 
titular sleuth’s hometown legend of a beauty queen who 
committed suicide the night she won her title. Nancy 
wins the same crown years later and spots the girl’s ghost 
in a cemetery, and the story transitions into Nancy’s 
abandonment of her teenage mystery solving after the 
death of her mother.
Still living at home a year after graduating high school, 
Nancy spends her time waiting tables at a local diner 
with George, her manager and former classmate, and 
Bess, a city girl summering in the beach town. She also 
is revealed to be casually hooking up with the show’s 
version of book character Ned Nickerson, who now goes 
by “Nick” and is a mechanic with a dark secret. After these 
four and the diner’s dishwasher stumble upon the body of 
a rich socialite from out of town, they become the prime 
suspects in her murder investigation.
As the group of less-than-friends works to clear their 
names to the police, Nancy finds herself reluctantly 
reentering the amateur detective game and uncovering 
secrets about the victim, the other suspects and even her 
own family members. Mounting evidence reveals that the 
ghost of the tragic beauty queen may be seeking revenge 
on the town and ends the episode looming over Nancy 
as she kneels over the 
recovered dress the girl 
wore when she died.
“Nancy Drew” itself 
is not a bad show. In fact, 
it has plot twists and 
character reveals fellow 
CW show “Riverdale” 
wishes it could pull off. The 
mystery is compelling, the 
setting is spooky and the 

characters are more complex than expected. Where the 
show falters, however, is in its strange relationship to the 
rest of the Nancy Drew franchise.
Throughout the premiere, the show makes it 
exceedingly clear this isn’t your grandmother’s Nancy 
Drew. The title character maintains almost none of her 
iconic traits of optimism and friendly resourcefulness and 
substitute it with aloofness and intense arrogance to prove 
Nancy’s struggle with grief has warped her personality. 
While the original book series’ happy disposition may 
seem out of place in modern television, the overt attempts 
(particularly the gratuitous sex scenes) to make the show 
edgy are ridiculous and almost laughable.
Again, on its own, the show could work. It lays a 
foundation for the kind of drama and intrigue that thrives 
on the CW network and embraces the fun of a local urban 
legend as a backdrop. However, by forcing the Nancy 
Drew label onto a show that desperately tries to shirk all it 
represents, it feels like the writers are struggling to strike 
a balance between old and new.
“Nancy Drew” really, really doesn’t want to be 
“Nancy Drew.” So why does it bother? With the success 
of “Riverdale” and “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” 
it’s easy to assume these shows work because they are 
updated versions of popular classics. By embracing more 
adult themes for shows aimed at teenagers, “Nancy 
Drew” assumes it can gain a following through overlaying 
salacious material on a wholesome series. Unfortunately, 
this combination misses the mark and suffers because of 
it.
If “Nancy Drew” wants to justify its attachment to 
its source material, the solution lies in returning to what 
made the books so timeless: focusing on the thrill of a 
mystery, rather than the complexities of the characters. 
Sure, the Depression-era 
Nancy Drew may not 
be memorable on her 
own, but the escapism 
of her stories captivated 
audiences for a reason. 
“Nancy Drew” could do 
the same; it just has to 
focus on being fun, not 
inexplicably steamy and 
comically ominous.

TV REVIEW

“Fractured,” directed by Brad Anderson 
(“The Machinist”), is a psychological thriller 
meant to make viewers doubt themselves and 
their observations. It follows Ray Monroe, 
played by Sam Worthington (“Avatar”), in a 
hospital that has no record of his six-year-
old daughter having 
ever been admitted.
Though the movie 
begins 
slowly, 
it’s 
well worth the wait. 
Throughout 
the 
entire first quarter 
of the movie, the 
film 
is 
saturated 
with 
dark, 
muted 
colors, 
slowly-
building piano music and unnerving action 
that makes the audience aware of the trauma 
that awaits. When it does, it takes a turn that 
no one is expecting.
Worthington’s dedication to the portrayal 
of Ray Monroe is what makes the story and 
character so believable. The movie centers 
around this man, lost and confused in a rather 
terrifying and unnatural situation, which 
makes Worthington’s role crucial to making 
the story plausible and moving it forward. 
Because we see events unfold from his 
perspective, we are naturally seeing what he 
sees, believing what he believes. The audience 

can’t help but side with him, and that’s 
the point. “Fractured” makes the audience 
sympathize with a man lost in a confusing 
world, then makes them doubt him and then 
brings it back to sympathy (before finally 
ending with doubt once more).
While there are surely other stories and 
movies that are similar in plot and maybe even 
in direction, the unsettling nature of this film 
is truly what makes it stand out. The film is 
purposefully slow and dragged-out so as to 
make the audience 
wonder how it will 
end. 
And 
after 
a 
solid ending begins 
to slowly form and 
the audience begins 
to feel confident in 
their understanding 
of how the plot will 
unfold, 
the 
movie 
takes a turn that 
is wholly unexpected at the time and yet 
completely predictable after the fact.
The 
ending, 
though 
not 
completely 
satisfying in the traditional way, is somehow 
perfect. It drives home the idea that no one 
can really understand anything or believe 
what is even right in front of his or her face, 
which makes it completely satisfying in its 
own right. The chilling final scene left me in 
shock as I wondered how I missed something 
so obvious. Coupled with Worthington’s 
stellar performance as Ray Monroe, that 
single moment of shock and wonderment 
makes the movie worth watching.

‘Fractured’ makes for a
spooky, satisfying whole

When Billboard removed “Old Town Road” from 
the Hot Country chart in early April, media and 
listeners alike were quick to shout racism. And with 
good reason. Lil Nas X is Black and country music 
is known for its whiteness and conservatism. Then, 
when Blake Shelton released his single “Hell Right” 
near the end of the record-breaking “hip-haw” hit’s 
reign, the lyrics “Then the girl from the small town 
took off the ‘Old Town’/ put on a little Hank Jr.,” 
reignited the argument that country music is racist, 
after Hank Jr. compared Obama to Hitler and was 
removed from EPSN. As a white, life-long country 
music fan, I followed the saga closely and was 
disappointed in Billboard and Blake. In the midst of 
country music’s identity crisis, why else would only 
the Black country rapper be excluded? While there’s 
no excuse for Lil Nas X’s unequal treatment, I’ve 
found the full story to be a bit more complicated than 
it looks at first glance. 
Today’s country music stars include Hootie and the 
Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker, R&B influenced 
Kane Brown and traditional-leaning up-and-comer 
Jimmie Allen. All Black men, all successful under the 
country label. Additionally, I’d be remiss if I didn’t 
acknowledge the powerful Black men in country 
that came before them, including Charley Pride and 
Ray Charles. Pride recorded 30 number one hits 
spanning 1966 to 1987 and Charles’s 1962 release 
Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music sold 
extremely well. (All this said, it should be noted there 
aren’t any Black women in mainstream country music 
today, likely because of the compounded difficulties 
they face from being part of both a gender and race 
that the genre marginalizes.)
But country music isn’t just whiteness with a 
few token Black male artists. Country music is 
fundamentally both Black and white. Hear me out. In 
the early stages of country music, black artists were 
often left out, which painted the entire genre as one 
just for white individuals. Additionally, the banjo 
has African roots. There’s plenty more to the story 
of country music’s origins, but regardless, it’s clear 
that at its birth the genre was never the ultra-white 
Anglo-Saxon Protestant music it’s been made out to 
be today. 
So what is country music then? Country artists 
and fans have been arguing about this over radio 
waves and in YouTube comments for years. What 
“real” country music is always seems to be what was 

happening 20 years ago, no matter the decade. Still, 
instruments like the banjo, fiddle and acoustic guitar 
are generally understood as “country.” Working-class 
themes and rural imagery are also accepted as well 
as lyrical storytelling. These loose requirements also 
tend to push that country music reflects “real life” 
and has a deeper meaning. But again, all of these 
“rules” have exceptions and conditions like having 
“meaning” are up for interpretation.
“Old Town Road” doesn’t tell a story. It doesn’t 
feature a fiddle or a banjo and I’m not sure what its 
“deeper meaning” is. But this doesn’t let the Nashville 
executives who kicked it off the chart off the hook. 
In other ways, “Old Town Road” is absolutely country 
music. Another piece of its history, the reason that 
“country” was recorded in the first place was to make 
money. Lil Nas X’s commercial success is the stuff 
Nashville dreams about. Also, the artist himself has 
a “country”-esque origin story as he is both from the 
South and self-made. Finally, in a genre where what’s 
authentic is constantly up for debate, the artist’s self-
identification as “country” holds a lot of weight. If 
Lil Nas X says his song is country music we should 
believe him like we believe Sam Hunt.
Ultimately, Lil Nas X’s juggernaut defies genre. 
That’s part of what made it so popular. However, 
if the success of “The Git Up” by Blanco Brown, a 
Black country rapper, is any indication, the genre 
was already making room for “Old Town Road” 
predecessors. The hip-haw “Cupid Shuffle” spent five 
weeks atop the Hot Country chart and was generally 
made welcome by the country music community. 
Although both songs can be dismissed as fun, Tik 
Tok-ready genre-blending earworms, refuting the 
idea of country music as white music is not only 
empowering but historically accurate. 
So, what were the intentions behind Billboard’s 
removal of “Old Town Road” from the country chart? 
Likely a mixture of racism and genuine anxiety over 
the preservation of “authentic” country music. But, as 
noted before, attempts at either are futile. The genre 
has never been fully white and is characteristically 
ever-changing. Even songs supposedly poised 
against the rise of artists like Lil Nas X actually 
lean in to what he’s doing. Remember “Hell Right,” 
the Blake Shelton song that takes a jab at “Old Town 
Road” from the beginning? It uses autotune in its 
pre-chorus. That’s why I’m expecting to hear a lot 
more about “the horses in the back” against hip-hop 
instrumentals in the future.

a LATTE

“Pockets of Silence at the Glorified Disco.” Fourteen 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance students stare at this 
strange amalgamation of words, amazed (and perhaps a 
little intimidated) by the fact that they have named a show 
they haven’t even created yet. 
“They did a photo shoot almost immediately after, where 
they made a poster for the show,” Assistant Professor of 
Dance Charli Brissey added in an interview with The Daily. 
“There was suddenly this strange camaraderie for a show 
that no one had made yet.”
This is what the first day of class looked like for 
DANCECHAMBERDANCE, a five week mini course 
that is expanding and testing the definitions of dance, 
chamber music and collaboration. In SMTD there 
has been an increasing interest in these collaborative, 
interdepartmental classes. Among an emerging gaggle of 
such classes, DANCECHAMBERDANCE has come forth 
as an “infrastructure” for cross-department collaboration. 
Brissey, who teaches the class, describes their role as 
“facilitator.” 
“I don’t choreograph for the show, I don’t tell the students 
what their collaboration needs to look like,” Brissey said. 
“I’m just there to teach them a little bit about production.” 
The show is entirely left to the students to run and 
organize. So how does a group of fourteen students — 
ranging from ages 19 to 35 with varied experiences in 
production and their respective fields — create a show from 
nothing but a title? 
The students at DANCECHAMBERDANCE break 
the rules a bit and test the limits of their project and each 
other’s artistry. In an interview with The Daily, students 
in the class Jacob Taitel and Aislinn Bailie described the 
process of creating this show as “exploratory” and “wildly 
improvisational.” They said that the first few rehearsals 
were mainly used to figure out what everybody could 
bring to the table. From there, it was clear the line between 
“dancer” and “musician” was going to become blurred: One 
dancer professed that they could DJ, another could play the 
drums, a tuba player was trained in ballet for a year and a 
bassoon player could beatbox. It is a piece where everyone 
does everything. It’s less about setting a dance piece to 
chamber music and more about artists creating a fusion 
piece with movement and sound as their primary tools. So 

the class tumbled forward, tossing out concepts, interesting 
words and scraps of music or choreography, and instead 
created a space to improvise with other artists and create 
something risky in a low-stakes environment. 
“It’s so nice to just let out energy and put something 
out there knowing that someone else will pick it up. Like, 
everyone’s just trying stuff,” said Taitel, a second year 
Masters student in Tuba Performance and Chamber Music 
and student in this class.
In addition to this class being a space for artists to 
experiment without the pressure of perfectionism, it has 
also become a space to learn about one’s own craft through 
a different kind of artist’s eyes. 
“I get some of my most effective criticism from 
other people within the arts,” Taitel said on the idea of 
collaborating with dancers, “because they don’t deal with 
the things that I have to deal with as a musician — they just 
hear the music.” Musicians who have never played improv 
before were met with the challenge of thinking and creating 
beyond the music stand (of which there are none of in this 
show). Same goes for the dancers; this class has become an 
opportunity for artists to expand their vocabulary and skill 
sets across artistic mediums.
And the results seem pretty exciting. And weird. “There 
are a lot of pockets, some disco, and, I don’t know, we break 
into a line dance at one point? And that’s pretty cool?” said 
Bailie, a Masters student in Bassoon. 
Other notable cameos in this piece include a metronomic 
solo dance piece, a set of pieces on the seven deadly sins and 
a good many dancers playing music and musicians dancing. 
“Sometimes we don’t even know what’s going to happen!” 
Bailie laughingly explained, “Not in a bad way … in an 
exciting way. You have to be present for it.”
In live performance, there is often a pressure to make 
capital-A Art, art that is supposed to feel deep and complex 
and cryptic, but oftentimes just renders the audience 
confused and feeling a bit left out. This group of artists have 
relieved themselves of that pressure and seem to just be 
creating for creation’s sake, reacting honestly from moment 
to moment, in what will be a unique, strange and genuine 
experience. 
“I think that what an audience member takes away 
from a piece is pretty up to them and their experiences and 
however they feel,” Taitel said, “but I guess if I had to choose 
something I want them to take away from this, it would be 
that weird things can create emotion too, and things that 
you wouldn’t expect can be extremely effective.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

STEPHANIE GURALNICK
For The Daily

In PBS’s “Press,” a cheerful yet outdated melodrama 
set in contemporary London, two British newspapers — 
The Post and The Herald — find themselves engaged in 
a war where the journalists that cheat and lie the most 
appear to be the victors. While the offices may be close 
in proximity, their journalistic practices and financial 
conditions differ significantly. 
The lowlife Post is led by uber-confident editor-in-
chief, Duncan Allen (Ben Chaplin, “Kiss Me First”), 
who was once an impressive and ethical journalist. His 
profession and unnecessarily high opinion of himself, 
though, have eroded these attributes in favor of seeking 
sensationalist stories.
Holly Evans (Charlotte Riley, “Dark Heart”) brings us 
inside the left-leaning, award winning, serious reporting 
Herald that prides itself on exposing corruption and 
hypocrisy. She is a humorless investigative journalist 
who marches on with the hunch that a new injustice is 
always around the corner. She represents what Duncan 
used to be — she abides by the highest journalistic 
practices, but lacks the cut-throat attitude of Duncan. 
Duncan, however, is not the one calling the shots 
for The Post. George Emmerson (David Suchet, “His 
Dark Materials”) is the CEO of World Wide News, 
the company that owns The Post. Emmerson is not 
motivated by financial gain, but is instead determined to 
wield his influence around the world.

The central focus of this six part mini-series is the 
differing practices of journalistic integrity of these 
respective papers. The result is continuous action that is 
impossible not to become entrenched in, even when the 
practice is as simple as reminding us that it’s wrong to 
steal. Holly represents the heroine: She fearlessly fights 
her way through the cruel and dark tabloid world, full 
of reporters who blackmail parents of kids who have 
committed suicide with threats of humiliating publicity 
if the grieving parents fail to meet interview demands. 
While it’s an entertaining show, “Press” comes up 
short in being mostly about print media, as if the Internet 
is not central to contemporary London journalism. The 
setting might be off by about two decades, but it doesn’t 
hinder the pacing or quality of the show. On the flip side, 
“Press” brings in real-world issues such as declining 
sales, press regulation, difference between public 
interest and interest to the public and whether or not 
something that is in the public domain is fair game.
Beyond its lame attempt at being relevant, “Press” 
also fails to humanize its characters, as most of them 
lack personal lives. Even Duncan, whose screensaver is a 
picture of his wife and kid, prefers to spend every second 
creating stories that will ruin other people’s lives and, 
consequently, his own in the process. Maybe because 
“Press” is a mini-series with a tight narrative, there is 
no time to explore the lives of the characters outside 
of work. The only reason it’s problematic is because 
the characters have been framed to make it seem like 
journalism is the only thing in their lives and they all 
have absolutely no interest in anything else.

‘Press’ is 20 years too late

TV REVIEW

JUSTIN POLLACK
For The Daily

PBS

Jesse 
Pinkman 
(Aaron 
Paul, 
“BoJack 
Horseman”) is, in many ways, the unsung 
hero of “Breaking Bad.” Even as Walter White 
(Bryan Cranston, “Malcolm in the Middle”) 
became just a tad too deplorable to sympathize 
with by the end of the series, Jesse maintained 
as a character viewers could see the humanity 
in, despite his crimes. After all, he was just 
a kid when he partnered up with Walter, his 
chemistry teacher, to join the meth trade. And 
though his youth is no excuse for what he ends 
up doing, it does make us more forgiving of his 
actions, more inclined to cling to him.
Yet, “Breaking Bad” was never really Jesse’s 
story. It was Walter White’s. It was the story 
of just how far a normal man will go to find 
wealth and power, confidence and meaning, 
even when it costs him the safety of his family 
and, eventually, his own life. The series 
finale wrapped up this story perfectly with 
Walter, or rather Heisenberg, making peace 
with himself, or at least as close to peace as 
he could manage. But for me there was still 
a looming question in the back of my mind: 
What about Jesse? How does his story end?
This is where “El Camino”, Netflix’s latest 
extension of the “Breaking Bad” universe, 
comes in, arriving more than six years after 
the show’s final episode. “El Camino” tells 
viewers everything they could want to know 
about Jesse’s fate, picking up exactly where 
“Breaking Bad” left off, with Jesse fleeing the 
neo-Nazis who kept him hostage in Todd’s 
(Jesse Plemons, “Fargo”) 1978 El Camino. 

Shootings and heists ensue, but Jesse isn’t in 
it for the reasons he once was. He’s desperate 
for money, not to fuel his own greed but to 
pay Ed (Robert Forster, “Mulholland Drive”) 
for a new identity and a new life. All in 
all, it appears that Jesse has learned from 
Walter’s mistakes. Meth dealing, despite its 
profitability and its thrills, just isn’t worth it 
for him, at least not anymore.
Jesse wants to escape his past, but can he? 
The short answer is no. Mike (Jonathan Banks, 
“Better Call Saul”) even tells him so in the 
film’s first scene, saying, “Sorry, kid, that’s 
the one thing you can never do.” No matter 
how far away from New Mexico he manages 
to run, he can’t run away from himself, from 
the people he’s killed and from the people 
he’s lost. You can see his torment, his grief 
written all over his face, covered in dirt and 
scars from his time in captivity. You can see it 
in his eyes, too, even after he succeeds in his 
mission. There’s no way for him to rid himself 
of it. There are only two options: die, or learn 
to live with himself. He chooses life, and I’m 
happy for it.
“El Camino” doesn’t need to exist, but 
I’m glad it does. It’s given Jesse’s journey a 
closure I never knew I needed. It doesn’t tie 
up every loose string, but it’s all the better 
for it. Had “El Camino” given Jesse a happier 
ending and a less ambiguous future, the movie 
would be devoid of the realism and complexity 
that made “Breaking Bad” so challenging 
and so exciting to watch. Because this film 
exists, “Breaking Bad” fans can take comfort 
in knowing that, even if Jesse isn’t okay now, 
maybe he might learn to be, and that’s more 
than enough for me. 

‘El Camino’ lets fans say
goodbye to Jesse Pinkman

Behind Enemy Lines with Penn State writer (and friend) Mike Persak

Ahead of No. 16 Michigan’s clash 
with No. 7 Penn State this weekend, 
The Daily called up an old friend. 
Mike Persak, former Michigan 
Daily Managing Sports Editor, 
now covers Penn State football for 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. We 
dialed up his number, turned on the 
recorder and let the (half-baked) 
thoughts flow. 
The Michigan Daily: So, what 
do you want to talk about?
Mike Persak: Do you want to 
know what I cooked for dinner? 
TMD: What did you cook for 
dinner?
MP: I figured out that it actually 
isn’t that hard to just make 
homemade 
chicken 
parmesan, 
so I’ve just been making chicken 
parmesan for myself like four 
nights a week.
TMD: I’m happy for you.
(awkward pause)
TMD: What else do you want to 
talk about?
MP: What do you think about 
tomorrow?
TMD: Tomorrow? Tomorrow’s 
Friday, it should be a good day—
MP: (Expletive) off. Saturday.
TMD: What do I think? I 
think (Michigan) is going to get 
blown out, honestly. I said two 
touchdowns, and I think it could 
be more.
MP: I’m not so sure.
TMD: Why? Why not?
MP: Penn State, their offense 
hasn’t been good against good 
defenses. I think Michigan has 
arguably the best defense that 
they’ve played so far.
TMD: Yeah, but are we sure 
Michigan’s defense is really good?
MP: Well, I don’t know. That’s 
the thing. Michigan, when they 
show up on defense, they’re 
really good. But, yeah, it’s a good 
question. I think — I split Penn 
State’s schedule into two spots. 
And they’ve played Idaho, Buffalo, 
Maryland and Purdue. Those four 
teams are not that good, and they 
really beat up on them. And those 
two teams have good defenses 

and they scored 17 points in each 
game. The only way I see it being 
more than two touchdowns is 
if it’s, like, 24-3, which I’m not 
necessarily ruling out, but it seems 
like unlikely. I don’t see Penn State 
running up the score here.
TMD: To me, it’s the kind of 
thing where if Michigan, let’s say 
they turn the ball over early and 
Penn State goes up a score or two 
scores, it’s over. It’s done.
MP: 
Yeah, 
it 
might 
just 
avalanche quickly. But the thing 
that’s funny to me is that I actually 
think these two teams are kind of 
similar offensively in that I think 
that both offenses are really close 
to like breaking out. Like, really 
breaking out. Penn State has 
technically broken out already, 
they have a top-10 scoring offense 
because they really kicked the 
you-know-what out of the teams 
they’ve beat up. But if you told 
me that one of the offenses kind 
of exploded on Saturday, and it 
was like kind of crazy and out of 
nowhere, I wouldn’t know which 
offense it would be, even if I think 
it’s probably Penn State.
TMD: I would be kind of 
shocked if Michigan’s offense went 
to Penn State during the night 
game and exploded.
MP: No, no. I don’t necessarily 
think that’s going to happen. But I 
think Michigan’s offense is closer 
than people think it is.
TMD: That’s interesting. Go on.
MP: I was reading a stat … 
comparing when Joe Morehead 
came in as OC at Penn State in 
2016 and when Josh Gattis came 
in as offensive coordinator for 
Michigan. (unnecessary rambling) 
Through the first six games, it’s 
extremely similar. The difference is 
that Michigan is 5-1 and Penn State 
was 4-2 at that time. And that was 
the year Penn State won the Big 
Ten championship. I’m not saying 
Shea (Patterson) is going to turn 
into Trace McSorley and Hassan 
Haskins or Zach Charbonnet is 
going to be Saquon, but the offense, 
it’s more different than people 
think it is. I think people thought 
it’s just a matter of scheming guys 

open, but that’s not the case, you 
know?
TMD: I think that’s interesting. 
People here talk about 2016 Penn 
State as the optimist’s take on this 
year, because they do have so much 
talent.
MP: Yeah. And it’s a different 
kind of talent, because Penn State 
was just like quarterback — they 
had Gesicki, Sayid Blackwell on 
the outside. They had some good 
receivers. But it was like, Trace 
McSorley was sick, and they 
finally just had to trust him. And 
Saquon was a god. But the other 
thing was, I remember watching 
that Penn State team and being 
like, ‘Jesus Christ, they just throw 
bombs and that’s all they do.’ The 
Big Ten Championship Game 
against Wisconsin that year, they 
just threw bomb after bomb after 
bomb.
TMD: McSorley throwing those 
slot fades on Michigan. I don’t 
know, I think the optimist’s take on 
this Michigan team is 2016 Penn 
State, and the pessimist’s take on 
this team is 2017 Michigan.
MP: For sure. And whatever 
way it goes. … I could see it either 
way.
TMD: How has your perspective 
on—
MP: Hold on, shh shh, listen.
TMD: I’m listening.
MP: (Crackling noise)
TMD: What was that?
MP: That was a beer can.
(Laughs)
TMD: Anyway. How has your 
perspective 
on 
the 
Michigan 
football program changed since 
you flew away from the nest?
MP: I mean, it’s pretty much the 
same. The answer is what everyone 
says. Michigan is convinced that 
it’s still the late ‘90s and Michigan 
is Michigan. I heard it put well 
by someone that, like, I’m not 
writing off — Michigan I think 
in any given year could make the 
College Football Playoff under 
Jim Harbaugh. But to expect 
them to be a perennial contender 
for the Playoff, it’s just not where 
the program is right now. I think 
people outside of Michigan get 

that, and I think people who watch 
Michigan every year don’t quite get 
that. But that’s just fandom.
(Random Lions blabber. Super 
Bowl bound. Other nonsense.)
MP: 
Do 
you 
think 
that 
Michigan currently has a Big 
Ten 
championship-winning 
quarterback?
TMD: Yes. 
MP: You do?
TMD: I mean, it depends how 
you define “Big Ten championship-
winning quarterback”. They don’t 
have the best quarterback in the Big 
Ten. But they have a quarterback 
who’s capable of leading a Big Ten 
— I still think this roster is talented 
enough to be good enough to put 
themselves in a position to win a 
Big Ten title. I just do. And I still 
think the talent is there with Shea 
Patterson. I just don’t know.
MP: Last year, I would have 
told you that I thought Shea was 
good enough to be a Big Ten 
championship, potential College 
Football 
Playoff. 
This 
year, 
obviously, he hasn’t been great. 
But I also don’t know… if I see 
Joe Milton or Dylan McCaffrey 
as being that either. Who knows. 
Maybe it’s J.J. McCarthy.
TMD: J.J. McCarthy, the next 

reason for Michigan fans to point 
two years down the road.
MP: I’m old enough to remember 
when Alex Malzone was that guy.
TMD: Then Shane Morris. 
Remember him?
MP: I do. What’s he up to? Still 
at Central?
TMD: Uhhhhh. We’ll cut this. 
TMD: 
I 
have 
two 
more 
questions because I don’t want to 
transcribe more. First question: 
prediction?
MP: I don’t know. I’m really bad 
at predictions. … I’ll go 28-10.
TMD: That’s pretty convincing.
MP: Yeah, 28-10, but it’s like 
closer than that. Do you know what 
I mean?
TMD: 28-10, but really it’s an 
eight-point game. Got it.
(Laughs)
MP: 28-10, but really Michigan 
wins by 35.
MP: I don’t know that’s just 
reaching into my gut and pulling 
out a random score that I think 
might happen. But if I have to 
make a prediction, don’t think 
Michigan’s going to be able to score 
on Penn State very well. See, man, 
the other thing is Penn State really 
hasn’t faced an offense like this 
from one of the good teams... 

TMD: I don’t know how much 
of the Michigan offense you’ve 
watched, but uh…
MP: I mean, I watched pretty 
much the whole game last game, 
and I watched pretty much the 
whole Wisconsin game. And Army. 
I have got the spectrum of both 
(good and bad). Either way, yeah, 
prediction: 28-17.
TMD: If we talk to you on 
Saturday morning, that’ll be 28-26.
MP: It’ll be 45-2, Penn State.
(Random Vegas spread talk. 
Mike offers gambling advice. Isn’t 
sure what can feasibly be printed, 
per his contractual obligations. 
Swears he’s not betting on Penn 
State games. That’s unethical.)
TMD: Last question, where 
should I go —
MP: Wait, is Louisville at home 
against Clemson? 
TMD: I don’t know.
MP: Because if so, that’s my 
pick: Lousiville to cover against 
Clemson.
TMD: Last question, where 
should I go for dinner tonight?
MP: How about a good Piada 
push?
TMD: 
Interesting. 
Very 
interesting. I’m going to turn off 
the recorder now.

Howard at home during media day

On 
Thursday, 
freshly-
minted Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard 
sauntered 
into 
the 
room full of reporters at Crisler 
Center. 
Greeting 
the 
crowd 
and recognizing some familiar 
faces, the 19-year NBA veteran 
sat down in the Ron and Eileen 
Weiser 
Family 
Club 
— 
an 
exclusive area of the arena 
shrouded in maize and blue — 
and looked like a man who’s been 
doing the job for years.
Answering questions about 
the state of the team, the 
development of his roster, the 
city of Ann Arbor and more, 
Howard gave a glimpse into what 
the men’s basketball program 
is going to look like under his 
tenure.
Blending key aspects of the 
program’s identity under former 
coach John Beilien and a new 
scheme and value set under 
Howard, a few key aspects of 
the team appear to be making 
their way into the limelight: 
work ethic, coachability and 
athleticism.
Going one by one, detailing 
his players’ strengths, a few key 
words kept making their way to 
the forefront. Chief among those 
was dedication.
Junior forward Isaiah Livers? 
He’s in the best shape of his life 
after hitting the weight room 
hard all off-season. Sophomore 
forward Brandon Johns Jr.? 
He’s been hustling in practice 
attempting to gain confidence in 
his position. Senior guard Zavier 
Simpson? He was working so 
hard his coach had to tell him 
to ease off the three-a-day 
practices. 
Howard lent further insight 
into this mentality through a 
story of one of his first weeks on 
the job this summer.
He was in his office late, 
around 10:30 p.m., when he 
heard music blaring from the 
gym at the Player Development 
Center. 
Startled 
and 
a 
bit 
confused, Howard made his 
way to the floor, where he saw 
a group of his guys putting up 
shots and getting in a workout. 

“I enjoy it,” Howard said. 

“Guys were in there working out. 
Whatever it takes for you to get 
into that zone, get comfortable, 
come into the gym and get a 
workout. You can blast your 
music or whatever music it is. I 
don’t care. At 10:30 I heard music 
playing, and there’s always one 
or two guys in there working out, 
and it’s not policed by me, I don’t 
see it. They do what they want to 
do.”
In the summer, these late-
night 
music-
blaring workouts 
became a staple 
of 
the 
off-
season regimen. 
Especially 
for 
sophomores 
Colin Castleton 
and 
David 
DeJulius, junior 
guard Eli Brooks, 
and Johns — the 
usual 
suspects 
for late-night shenanigans.
Howard also noted that his 
players are inherently coachable, 
always striving to get better — a 
skill perhaps most embodied by 
Johns.
The sophomore struggled to 
find the floor in his first year 
with the Wolverines. Confidence 
problems, difficulties adjusting 
to 
a 
new 
position 
and 
a 
complicated offensive scheme 
were used as reasons for his 
benching. This offseason, the 
name of the game has been 
building 
up 
confidence 
and 
getting ready to take a larger role 
in a team that saw its top three 
offensive producers take off for 
the NBA.

“Brandon is a very athletic 
guy who has a beautiful stroke 
in his jump shot,” Howard said. 
“I’m just instilling more and 
more confidence in Brandon. 
He’s competing hard in practice. 
He’s grasping a lot of the new 
responsibilities in teaching what 
is asked of him. He’s a joy to 
work with.
“I see that he’s gonna have his 
chance to play a lot this year, but 
as he knows, it starts in practice. 
You gotta earn your minutes.”
Straying away 
from basketball, 
Howard 
also 
delved into what 
made Michigan 
and the city of 
Ann Arbor such 
a great place — 
especially 
for 
any top recruits 
who 
may 
be 
making 
their 
college decisions 
soon.
Discussing the diverse food 
scene, the Art Fair and the 
unparalleled academics, Howard 
provided a snapshot into his 
recruiting toolkit. After all, 
basketball is only one of many 
factors going into a recruit’s 
decision of where to spend their 
lives for the next one to five 
years. 
But 
his 
larger-than-life 
personality and sense of humor 
snuck into his description of the 
city, too. 
So when he added, “And we 
have me,” when listing off what 
makes Michigan the place to be 
as a student athlete, he seemed 
right at home.

Michigan ready for physical play

End-to-end hockey. Battles 
on the boards. Body checks, 
poke checks and forechecks. 
Anything to bother a player 
and get position in between a 
Michigan player and the net. 
Grinding hockey.
That’s 
the 
first 
phrase 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
used to describe the scrappy 
play style the team had faced 
thus far. It was gritty. It was 
extremely 
physical. 
The 
Wolverines had to fight for 
every inch of the ice.
They saw it last weekend 
against No. 10 Clarkson — 
every loose puck required a 
battle. The space in front of 
the net was clogged by Golden 
Knight players. They outworked 
Michigan without the puck, 
and the moment the Wolverines 
had the puck on their stick a 
Clarkson player was preparing 
for a hit. These little details 
ultimately led to a loss and a tie. 
 
Michigan will see the same 
style of play again this weekend 
with Lake Superior. 
While all teams aim to play 
with a high level of physicality, 
in the Big Ten, speed and skill 
reign supreme over strength and 
size. There’s much more open 
ice to skate and make plays. But 
non conference opponents like 
the Golden Knights and Lakers 
force the Wolverines to adjust 
their play style slightly. 
“We played Lake State last 
year,” said senior forward Jake 
Slaker. “They definitely play 
the same kind of similar style 

(as Clarkson). Kind of a grindy, 
simple game so now we’re 
expecting what we had last 
weekend so we can change a 
few things and be ready for the 
weekend.”
All 
week 
in 
practice, 
Michigan has been prepping 
and fine-tuning its play in the 
wake of the series with the 
Clarkson. 
There’s been a lot of battle 
drills, contact drills — really 
anything 
to 
get 
the 
team 
further attuned to the physical 
play. Ultimately, its focus is 
on competing hard, especially 
from the get-go. Just like last 
weekend, the Wolverines know 
if they want to win, they have 
to get off to an early lead. They 
cannot afford to play from 
behind. 
Last year, when Michigan 
played Lake Superior, the games 
almost didn’t resemble hockey. 
Whether the puck was nearby 
or not, the Lakers were hitting 
hard. The Friday night game 
had 18 penalties, and Saturday’s 
had 10.
And Lake Superior has the 
personnel to make that play 
style work. Its roster is stacked 
with big, strong defensemen. 
Only one of its blue line players 
measures under six feet tall. 
Offensively, the Wolverines 
aren’t necessarily known for 
being physical. Against the 
Golden Knights, the forwards 
showed 
they 
could 
handle 
matching up against defenders 
with a size advantage. But 
playing a stronger team gives 
Michigan a chance to win with 
a different skill — speed.

“It’s nice when you play 
those physical teams,” Slaker 
said. “Usually they’re a little bit 
slower and clunkier. It’s a time 
for the fast guys like myself to 
use that to our advantage.”
While playing a gritty team 
offers the Wolverines a chance 
to 
display 
their 
quickness, 
there’s also a catch — less open 
ice to play. Big, physical teams 
take away space to move the 
puck in the offensive zone, 
particularly around the net. It’s 
an issue Michigan battled with 
last weekend, and will have to 
overcome this weekend to have 
a chance of winning.
“As a team we’ve all agreed 
upon (the fact) that we need 
to drive the net better,” said 
fifth-year senior forward Jacob 
Hayhurst. “When we see shots 
going towards their net we need 
to get in front of their goalie’s 
eyes and drive the back post in 
order to create more scoring 
opportunities.”
Crashing the net will require 
the Wolverines to perfectly 
balance 
both 
speed 
and 
strength.
To 
make 
matters 
more 
difficult, the team will be 
without one of its most physical 
players, 
senior 
defenseman 
Griffin Luce. He was suspended 
one game after hitting a player 
from behind in the closing 
minutes of last Saturday’s game. 
In his place, another defender — 
maybe sophomore Jake Gingell 
or 
fifth-year 
senior 
Shane 
Switzer — will have to step up.
“Their forwards aren’t real 
big,” Pearson said. “They play 
strong, but we have to use our 
quickness and our speed. Would 
I like to have Griff in the line 
up? Yes. But Gingell is physical. 
Switzer is a big guy so I think 
we’ll be fine there.”
But after Clarkson, Michigan 
is better prepared to handle 
situations where every puck is 
a battle to get to. A game where 
ice space, especially in front of 
the net, won’t be easy to come 
by. And now, the Wolverines 
know what they’ll have to do 
to find success against a team 
that plays an extremely physical 
brand of hockey.

As much as any single game in college football, 

the Penn State whiteout is a spectacle. This year’s 

edition — Penn State-Michigan on Saturday night 

— was announced way back in April, when college 

football is the last thing on most fans’ minds.

The announcement wasn’t much of a surprise. 

The Nittany Lions have been holding whiteouts 

since 2004, and Saturday’s will be their sixth 

against Michigan, the most of any team.

For home fans, the whiteout is a way of life. The 

stadium is surrounded by open fields and parking 

lots, perfect for huge tailgates and RV parks. 

Fans buy into the experience. Their dedication to 

wearing white combined with a metal stadium 

that shakes under the weight of more than 

100,000 screaming fans makes it an imposing 

experience for away teams and fans.

But for those away fans, it’s also an experience 

rarely matched by any other in the sport — for 

better or for worse. The Daily spoke with seven 

Michigan fans who have attended whiteout games 

to get a picture of what a whiteout is like from an 

outsider’s perspective.

THE ATMOSPHERE

Most people interviewed said that the whiteout 

was unlike anything they’ve seen at Michigan 

Stadium, perhaps with the exception of the first 

“Under the Lights” game in 2011. Penn State is 

located two-and-a-half hours from Pittsburgh, 

the closest city, and it’s hard for casual fans to get 

to — so those that come are the diehards, and the 

whiteout game is the crown jewel of every season. 

The diehards all buy in.

Kelly Heller, attended in 2013: When you walk 

into the stadium, you can’t miss it.

Zack Kessler, attended in 2013 and 2017: This 

is gonna sound dumb, but it is very white. It is 

astoundingly white.

Brendan Warren, attended in 2017: I was 

the only one not wearing white in the entire 

student section. Actually, there was one other 

guy in yellow. But out of like 20,000 in that whole 

section, it was all white.

Steve Rosenberger, attended in 2010 and 

2017: The first game wasn’t as hyped up … because 

it wasn’t an undefeated ranked matchup like the 

one I went to two years ago. But Penn State kind of 

got better at the whiteouts since then.

Ken Davidoff, attended in 2015: I didn’t 

know about the whiteout until I showed up at the 

stadium. It’s actually very funny because I had a 

white Michigan golf shirt, like a polo shirt. Just 

having no idea about the whiteout.

Warren: I was getting booed the entire time.

Davidoff: (Penn State fans) were turning to 

high-five me and I would pull my zipper down 

and show them the block ‘M,’ the blue ‘M,’ and 

they were like … ‘What are you doing? It’s a 

whiteout! Why are you wearing a white Michigan 

shirt?’ And I laughed, I said ‘I’m a wolf in sheep’s 

clothing, I didn’t know about the whiteout.’

Dan Mickelson, attended in 2010 and 2017: If 

you go to a night game in Ann Arbor, life is still 

going on outside the game. But everyone in Happy 

Valley is wearing white except for the away fans 

there for that game.

Heller: It’s something that I’ve never seen 

Michigan pull off. … Even a maize out, people 

wear gray, people wear white, people wear blue. 

There was not a person 90 years old or an infant 

that wasn’t wearing white.

Rosenberger: When I was there two years ago, 

the fireworks got amped up and the rock music 

gets turned up. … They do it to a point where it 

takes a bunch of inauthentic things, combines it 

and it kind of becomes something authentic just 

by, they’re not apologetic about it.

THE GAME

The Wolverines haven’t had much luck in 

whiteout games, losing three of the five matchups. 

Though Michigan won in 2006 and 2015, the 

matchups it lost were perhaps more memorable. In 

2010, the Nittany Lions won, 41-31, in a shootout.

Jack Warner, attended in 2010: We were sort 

of licking our chops the whole time, the whole 

drive out there, and we were pretty optimistic 

that this was gonna be Rich Rod’s signature win 

and this was gonna jump-start the program. And 

obviously that’s not how it turned out.

In 2013, Brendan Gibbons missed three field goals 

en route to a 43-40, quadruple-overtime loss.

Heller: For (Penn State) it’s the best part. 

For anybody else it’s the worst part, is that the 

students come in early, they stay until the end, 

and their goalposts are white. So at night, when 

they’re behind the goalposts and they’re going for 

a field goal, the students start swaying and you 

can’t see the goalposts.

Mickelson: It’s hard to go into a stadium like 

that. … I was a student manager back in ‘07 so I 

know you can’t replicate that in practice. There’s 

no way to pump in noise like that and prepare a 

team for an away game like that.

Heller: I fully believe, obviously if they were at 

home, they would’ve totally won. But if not for the 

whiteout … they would’ve made those field goals.

And in 2017, Saquon Barkley ran for 121 yards, 

cutting through the Wolverines’ defense in a 42-13 

blowout.

Warren: (Michigan) started the game on 

defense, so everyone was silent. Dead silent. And 

I was just screaming because we were on defense, 

and then Saquon Barkley scored very quickly and 

that kinda shut me up.

Mickelson: From our vantage point, (Barkley) 

was running towards us. It was just wild to see the 

whole place shake.

The environment provides what many believe 

is a built-in advantage for the Nittany Lions.

Rosenberger: I don’t think it (affected) as 

much for Denard (Robinson), because they were 

used to going no-huddle all the time and Rich 

Rod’s teams … called their plays in with hand 

signals from the sideline. But when you’re trying 

to huddle up, the sound is of another — it’s even 

louder than any other stadium I’ve been to.

Warner: We’ve seen better Michigan teams go 

into Penn State in a similar environment and win, 

like in 2015. … I think the impact of the crowd is 

often overstated, and that’s often especially the 

case with Penn State because I think the whiteout 

is more a marketing scheme than an actual 

difference maker on the football field.

Rosenberger: They make the whiteout their 

biggest game of the year, so they see it as an 

advantage, and they move it around. They use it as 

a weapon.
