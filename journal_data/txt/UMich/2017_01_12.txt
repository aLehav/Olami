On Wednesday, Secretary of 

the Army Eric Fanning spoke 
to a crowd of students, staff 
and faculty during a fireside 
chat with Alec Gallimore, dean 
of the College of Engineering, 
at the Chrysler Center on 
North Campus. Fanning met 
with University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel earlier 
in the day.

During the talk, Fanning 

focused on the importance and 
versatility of public service 
careers, as well as his path 
to 
becoming 
the 
secretary 

of the Army. He discussed 
his beginnings in the public 

service 
sector, 
stating 
that 

he 
first 
became 
interested 

in government work as an 
undergraduate at Dartmouth 
University.

“I was (at Dartmouth) in 

1988,” 
Fanning 
said. 
“Both 

parties had open primaries, 
so there were quite a few 
candidates 
running 
for 

president. It’s a small state; there 
aren’t many places to go and 
they were always on campus. I 
just got the bug for government 
politics, government service.”

Fanning, a Kalamazoo native 

and the self-described “CEO 
of the Army,” is responsible 
for overseeing its $140 billion 
budget and personnel matters, 
among other things. Though 

Robertson Auditorium was 

filled with about 500 students, 
faculty and staff who came 
to see the first talk of the 
University of Michigan’s Ross 
School of Business Positive 
Links Speaker Series this 
semester 
which 
featured 

University alum Adam Grant 
Wednesday afternoon. Grant, 
a Wharton School top-rated 
professor, 
discussed 
the 

seven characteristics he sees 
original thinkers exhibit in 
the workplace to the sold 
out event. The speaker series 
aims to spreads ideas about 
positive business practices in 
the workplace.

Grant received his Ph.D. 

in organizational psychology 
from the University in less 
than three years. The author 
of multiple bestselling books, 
he is currently co-writing 
a 
book 
with 
technology 

executive and author Sheryl 
Sandberg about being resilient 
in times of hardship.

He posited that original 

thinkers: 
brainstorm 

differently, 
take 
risks 
on 

novel ideas, harness anxiety, 
make the unfamiliar familiar, 
are tempered radicals, find 
the right allies and fight 
“groupthink.”

“If you track 40 years of 

data, we know that if you 
were to take five people and 
instead of putting them in the 

same room, if you were to put 
them all in separate rooms to 
brainstorm alone, you would 
get more ideas and better 
ideas,” Grant said.

Grant 
further 
explained 

original thinkers avoid the 
typical prototypes that leaders 
and managers may come up 
with. 
He 
highlighted 
the 

importance of brainstorming 

one’s 
own 
ideas, 
as 
this 

promotes divergent thinking.

“Before you judge others’ 

ideas, spend five minutes 
brainstorming 
your 
own 

ideas,” Grant said.

Grant 
also 
incorporated 

his psychology background 
into his lecture. He noted 
anxiety is a resource that can 
be converted into productive 

emotions, such as excitement 
or enthusiasm.

LSA freshman Leann Abad 

said Grant’s lecture was a 
great opportunity to learn the 
positives of business, as he 
is currently applying to the 
Business School.

“I 
really 
liked

Spin the Bottle, a new dating 

app launched at the end of 2016 
by entrepreneur Matt Cohen and 
software 
developers 
Andrew 

Stanton and Nish Patel, is aiming 
to revolutionize the world of 
dating apps. Instead of swiping 
left or right on dozens of photo 
profiles, Spin the Bottle utilizes 
video chatting in hopes that it 
will help users develop stronger 
connections right away.

The app became available to 

University of Michigan students 
in early December, but is available 
on other college campuses across 
the country and is most popular 
at Columbia University and New 
York University, where it launched 
in September.

Like other dating apps, users 

set a geographic range and 
preferred gender, but the rest is up 
to chance. Modeled after the party 
game of the same name, users find 
a match by “spinning the bottle.”

When someone opens the 

app, they are met with a circle of 
profile pictures centered around 
a graphic of a bottle. The user

Officials assert increase in international students instead result of foreign interest

A new national report released 

by 
the 
National 
Bureau 
of 

Economic 
Research 
concludes 

recent increases in international 
student enrollment nationwide 
are the result of a decrease 

in 
state 
funding. 
University 

administrators, however, maintain 
that this is not case, despite 
popular 
student 
perception. 

Though both trends hold true 
at the University of Michigan in 
recent years, administration points 
to other factors that may influence 
international attendance.

The NBER paper, released in 

December 2016, finds that between 
1996 and 2012, a 12-percent 
increase in foreign enrollment 
at public research universities 
correlated 
with 
a 
10-percent 

decrease in state funding.

From fall 2012 to fall 2016, total 

international enrollment at the 
University increased by 15 percent 
— from 5,881 to 6,764 students 

— according to the Office of the 
Registrar’s Enrollment Summary.

International 
undergraduate 

enrollment alone went up 14.25 
percent, 
while 
international 

graduate 
and 
professional 

enrollment 
increased 
15.35 

percent.

Over 50 faculty, students and 

city residents attended a teach-
in Wednesday night at Hatcher 
Graduate Library to discuss 
issues pertaining to the creation 
of a sanctuary campus for 
undocumented immigrants, as 
well as local initiatives planned 
for the future.

A sanctuary campus is defined 

as any college or university 
that adopts policies to protect 
undocumented students from 
deportation. More than 1,000 
University of Michigan students 
took part in a walkout protest 
on Nov. 16, where they called 
for the University to become 
a sanctuary campus, as well 
as for administrators to better 
represent minority students.

The event was the first in a 

series of teach-ins sponsored 
by the University’s Department 
of 
History, 
Department 
of 

American Culture and the LSA 
Democracy in Action Fund. 
Event organizers created the 
teach-in as a space where a

Nonpartisan elections, new holiday 
resolutions passed at CSG meeting

Student Government discusses initiatives in conjunction with City Council 

ON THE DAILY: HARBAUGH SIGNS 2035 RECRUIT

Arriving 
earlier 
than 

expected, Jim Harbaugh and 
his wife Sarah’s newest son 
John Harbaugh was born 
yesterday at Mott’s Children’s 
Hospital. 
According 
to 

Harbaugh’s 
Twitter, 
John 

weighs 4 pounds and 13 ounces 
with an 18 inch wingspan.

On 
Twitter, 
Harbaugh 

called 
John 
“our 
newest 

Wolverine.”

On January 6th, Harbaugh 

tweeted while at the White 
House with Sarah that the 
baby was expected to arrive 
on February 6th. Despite this 
former expecting date, John 
had other plans.

The Harbaughs announced 

the pregnancy on June 20th. 
This is the couple’s fourth 
child 
but 
is 
Harbaugh’s 

seventh. One of his sons, Jay, is 

a tight ends and special teams 
coach for the Wolverines and 
another son, James, 
is a current student 
at the University.

“There’s nothing 

I’d 
rather 
be 

defined than as a 
dad. People define 
us men in a lot 
of 
ways: 
doctor, 

lawyer, 
dentist, 

construction 
worker, 
teacher, 

coach. But being 
called a dad is the 
defining moment,” 
Harbaugh 
said 

in a Free Press 
interview.

This 
new 

addition 
to 
the 

Wolverines 
could 

not have come at a 

better time, replacing safety 
Jabrill Peppers who declared 

for the NFL draft on Tuesday.

- MATT HARMON

A resolution urging the 

city of Ann Arbor to adopt 
nonpartisan 
November 

elections was passed by the 
Central Student Government 
Tuesday night during its first 
meeting of the year.

According to the resolution, 

August 
primary 
elections 

make it hard for students to 
vote as they are usually not 
on campus during the summer 
months. This has resulted in 
a remarkably low turnout — 
under 20 percent — over the 
past few years.

City 
Council 
rejected 
a 

2015 University of Michigan 
proposal to move the 2016 
primary election date from 

August to July.

The 
authors 
of 
the 

resolution, 
Public 
Policy 

junior Nadine Jawad and LSA 
senior Noah Betman, point to 
prior initiatives the University 
has 
taken 
to 
promote 

political 
participation, 
like 

the Edward Ginsberg Center 
for Community Service and 
Learning — a center dedicated 
to 
engaging 
University 

students 
with 
the 
greater 

Ann Arbor community — and 
emphasized the fact that civic 
engagement is an ideal held by 
the University.

Jawad and Betman also 

argued the resolution would 
strengthen the relationship 
between the city of Ann Arbor 
and the University.

The resolution requests CSG 

to support of this proposal, 

and the authors to present 
it to City Council at its next 
meeting.

CSG held a town hall last 

semester, discussing the high 
costs of housing in the city. 
A major topic of the town 
hall was discussing students’ 
historically 
contentious 

relationship with Ann Arbor. 
State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–
Ann Arbor), who served as a 
panelist, emphasized impacts 
of increasing housing costs, 
like the exclusion of students 
of lower socioeconomic status.

“(Ann 
Arbor’s) 
diversity 

is slowly escaping us,” Rabhi 
said. “If we don’t work hard 
and make sure we have our 
full options on where to live, 
not only will our student 
body become less diverse, our 
community will become less 

diverse.”

Panelist 
Mary 
Jo 

Callan, director of the 
Ginsberg 
Center, 
a 

University 
organization 

focused 
around 
social 

change, 
said 
students 

can be a huge ally in the 
efforts to combat high 
costs — Councilmember 
Zachary Ackerman (D–
Ward 3) agreed during 
the panel, adding that 
during city elections in 
August, the median age of 
the voter is 61 years old.

 
“(Ackerman) is a true 

ally, but he is one of 11,” 
Callan said. “Politicians 
only 
have 
as 
much 

courage as we, voters, the 
community, have.”

Jawad also mentioned 

that 
after 
holding 
a 

town hall and speaking 
with many residents of 
Ann Arbor, there was 
widespread support for 
the initiative.

he was appointed to his current 
position by President Obama 
only last year, he worked as a 
congressional aide during the 
Clinton administration and has 
spent much of the last 25 years 
in various jobs with the Army, 
Navy and Air Force.

“My team likes to call me 

the oldest millennial, because 
I’ve had a bizarre career path,” 
Fanning 
said. 
“But 
I 
was 

moving into many different 
things, seizing many different 
opportunities. People can get 
very focused on wanting to do 
‘X’ and that’s not necessarily 
the best way to come into 
Washington. The best way to 
come into Washington is to find 
good bosses doing interesting 
things and start there.”

Fanning also offered advice 

given to him by his first boss 
to students looking to go into 
any 
kind 
of 
management 

position. According to Fanning, 

communication is crucial to 
managing any organization.

“Never 
underestimate 

the 
degree 
you 
need 
to 

communicate,” Fanning said. 
“That is a non-stop, ongoing 
requirement for any leadership 
job. I find that even in a large 
organization like the Army, you 
can drive change very quickly, so 
long as you have the right people 
involved and you just prioritize 
and focus on them. If I tried to 
have a handle on everything 
the Army did, I would grind to 
a halt. You have to size up the 
people you trust and tell them, 
‘Come to me when you need help 
because you’re on your own.’ ”

The event was put on by the 

College of Engineering as part 
of Entrepreneurship 390, a class 
taught by Max Shtein, associate 
professor of material sciences 
and 
entrepreneurship. 
The 

event was open to anyone, and 
the auditorium was nearly filled 
by students, staff and faculty 
from all areas of the University.

The advice Fanning gave, 

Shtein felt, fit perfectly into his 

curriculum. 
Entrepreneurship 

390 
focuses 
mostly 
on 

entrepreneurial 
design, 
but 

the class also deals with more 
general 
topics 
regarding 

business and management.

“He wanted to talk about the 

importance of public service, 
and how they do need somebody 
with 
entrepreneurship 
skills 

and desire to innovate and 
business acumen, as well as 
technical skills, to get into the 
service line of work,” Shtein 
said. “In the class we focus a 
lot on problems — what are 
high quality problems, what 
are difficult problems, what 
are problems that affect a lot 
of people. And this is certainly 
within that realm, so I think it 
was good for folks to see that, 
yeah, this is a huge organization 
… how do you run something like 
that?”

The audience responded to 

Fanning’s talk enthusiastically.

spin it, and whoever it lands on is 
immediately called through the 
app for a thirty-second video chat. 
After the chat, users can give each 
other “kisses” to signify interest; 
if both people give a kiss, the pair 
matches and can message further 
through the app’s interface.

Safety features are included 

to 
protect 
users 
from 
the 

uncertainties 
that 
could 
be 

involved in video chatting. For 
instance, the app operates using 
facial 
recognition, 
so 
if 
the 

camera doesn’t recognize what it’s 
pointed at as a face, the call will be 
immediately blurred out.

Cohen 
is 
confident 
video 

chatting can lead to a more 
successful 
online 
dating 

experience. He wrote the Daily 
in an email he found it difficult to 
learn any real facts about a person 
from a dating profile through his 
own online dating experiences. 
But he thinks adding video chats to 
the mix can change this.

“Sure you can get some insight 

from a profile or photo, but you still 
don’t know how they act, how they 
sound and what their personality 
is like,” Cohen wrote. “When it 
comes to online dating, video is 
better because it allows for face-to-
face interaction right from the very 
first contact, meaning that you can 
assess not only physical attraction 
but also personality and chemistry, 
all from your mobile device.”

Columbia 
University 
junior 

Chapman 
Hughes, 
the 
app’s 

campus representative at Columbia 
and a junior at the university, 
thinks the impromptu video-
chatting 
feature 
is 
partularly 

well-suited to college students — 
especially those who are looking to 
enter a more serious relationship.

“It’s well-suited to a college 

campus, especially in our day 
and age, because it’s so hard to 
find someone who’s willing to 
take the time to possibly be in a 
relationship,” Hughes said. “When 
you have an app where you’re 
immediately facing this person, 
you kind of have to be on your feet 
and able to say why you’re there 
and what you’re looking for.”

According 
to 
Hughes, 
her 

classmates have found that the 
type of person who uses Spin 
the Bottle is much more likely to 
follow up online communication 
with actual dates than people on 
other apps, like Tinder. Because of 
this, she sees the app moving more 
toward older college students.

“I personally see this moving 

more towards older students,” 
Hughes said. “Juniors and seniors, 
and possibly our large graduate 
student 
population, 
because 

they’re (more often) the ones 
who are looking for a meaningful 
relationship… On other apps, 
there aren’t a lot of people who 
are coming out of that with a 
relationship, or even a great story.”

Stanton, who helped to build 

the app’s interface from scratch, 
is 35 and married. He doesn’t have 

much personal experience with 
online dating, but he’s hopeful 
that breaking into the college 
demographic can be a gateway to 
other groups of users.

“It’s kind of like what the 

college kids do is cool for people 
my age,” Stanton said. “It just 
spreads. We feel that if we can 
capture the college market, it will 
grow from there.”

For now, though, the app is 

concentrating on college students. 
Cohen said the team has begun 
promoting Spin the Bottle in 
Ann Arbor, and is currently in 
the process of hiring a campus 
representative 
to 
help 
with 

promotion efforts here.

Though 
the 
app 
isn’t 
as 

popular at the University yet, LSA 
freshman Ben Fu thinks Spin the 
Bottle could become a campus 
fixture. He said he has only used 
Tinder in the past, but said he 
would be open to trying Spin 
the Bottle if he was looking for 
something more serious.

“I 
think 
it’s 
better 
than 

(Tinder),” Fu said. “You get a 
better sense of who the person is, 
rather than just reading their bio. 
Most people don’t even read the 
bio anyway. They just swipe right 
or left.”

On the other hand, Fu hasn’t 

used dating apps in a while and 
he thinks he might try his luck 
outside the digital realm.

“My success with women was 

a lot better after I stopped using 
Tinder,” Fu said. “I just learned 
how to approach them in real life.”

enrollment increased 25 percent.

Meanwhile, in this same time 

span, total enrollment of U.S. 
citizens and permanent residents 
has increased by only 1.09 percent.

An 
article 
published 
by 

Bloomberg in late December 
references the report and notes its 
finding that, since the recession, 
there has been a demand for “full-
tuition-paying” students at state 
schools.

Statistics from the Institute of 

International Education show that 
565,000 international students 
enrolled at U.S. postsecondary 
schools 
in 
the 
2005-2006 

school year, versus 1.04 million 
international students in the 2015-
2016 school year — an 85 percent 
increase. 
Further, 
according 

to the State Higher Education 
Executive Officers Association, 
while tuition made up only 35.8 
percent of public universities’ 
revenue in 2008, it made up 46.5 
percent in 2015.

However, the article notes 

that while in general, reliance on 
tuition has dropped recently, it is 
still above 2008 numbers.

State Funding and University 

Response 
to 
International 

Enrollment

The University faced a 21.6 

percent funding cut by the state 
in 2011, as part of a general cut in 
higher education funding under 
Gov. Rick Snyder. 2016 saw a 4.3 
percent increase in state funding 
overall, bringing most schools’ 
numbers back to where they 
were before the 2011 cut, but the 
University’s allotment remains 
7.8 percent less than it was prior 
to 2011.

In June 2016, the University’s 

Board of Regents voted to increase 
tuition for both in-state and out-
of-state students, leading to an 
overall increase of $86.35 million 
in University funds. Lower state 

funding was cited as one reason 
for the increase.

State Rep. Adam Zemke (D–

Ann Arbor), who has voiced his 
opinion in the past about the need 
for more state funding, said he is 
confident the University is acting 
appropriately given the decrease 
in funding.

“I’m certain that the University 

is taking steps that they have 
deemed necessary, unfortunately, 
to figure out another way to 
generate revenue due to the 
fact that the state has been 
underfunding them for quite 
some time,” he said.

Zemke said the 2011 funding 

cut was very significant, and does 
not think it is fair for the schools to 
have to generate its own revenue.

“The idea that we as a state 

have decided through our lack 
of appropriation that it is okay 
for universities to generate most 
of their operating revenue from 
tuition, I think is really terrible 
and speaks to the tremendous 
amount of student debt in this 
country,” he said.

University officials, however, 

are quick to emphasize that the 
spike in international enrollment 
does not represent an explicit 
strategy to make up for lost 
funding.

Kedra Ishop, vice provost for 

Enrollment Management, said it 
makes sense that international 
enrollment 
has 
increased 

nationally overall. She explained 
other schools that have a difficult 
time appealing to domestic out-
of-state students look to potential 
international student.

“(In admissions,) your ability 

to market to your residents, your 
non-residents and international 
students varies,” she said. “You’re 
going to have, in some cases, 
institutions that are able to recruit 
and market themselves amongst 
students from foreign countries, 
perhaps more than they are 
able to do the same for students 
domestically, out of state.”

She 
added 
that 

foreign interest in a 
U.S. education has increased 
exponentially over the past decade. 
However, she said the University 
does not use a purposeful or 
deliberate recruitment strategy 
for international students because 
there has never been a shortage of 
applicants.

She noted that according to 

the enrollment summary’s new 
freshmen enrollment data, the 
percentage 
of 
international 

students in incoming classes has 
been very consistent since 2012, 
lingering around 4 percent — a 
statistic that often surprises 
people.

“There is a belief that our 

international student population 
in our freshman class and in 
our new student population is 
much larger than it is, when in 
reality, it hovers between two 
and a half and 4 percent, which 
is considerably smaller than 
many institutions who are more 
deliberately recruiting from an 
international population,” she 
said.

Ishop said about two-thirds 

of 
University 
applicants 
are 

out of state — the bulk of that 
being U.S. citizens — and these 
numbers have grown drastically 
since 2010 and 2011. She said 
admissions focuses more on 
balancing the in-state and out-of-
state populations, and there is no 
need to fill a financial quota.

“We are able to attract a high-

quality class from the state of 
Michigan and also respond to 
almost overwhelming demand 
from an out-of-state population of 
students who are equally strong,” 
she said. “We haven’t been in a 
position to need to bring forward 
an 
international 
recruitment 

strategy to fill financial coffers.”

She noted that the University’s 

out-of-state and international 
fees are the same.

International 
Student 

Response

Despite 
Ishop’s 
evidence, 

international 
students 
said 

they feel that admitting more 
foreign students does benefit the 
University financially, and had 
mixed responses to the increase.

Engineering 
freshman 

Edmond Tsoi, an international 
student from Hong Kong, said he 
thinks the rise in international 
enrollment is a more direct effort 
to boost the University’s ranking.

Though Tsoi completed three 

years of high school in the United 
States, he pointed to what he 
called the “high standard” of 
students coming directly from 
other countries. He added these 
students bring in more revenue.

“I have a couple of friends 

who came directly from China or 
even Korea or other countries,” 
he said. “Usually they are one of 
the top students in their country. 
By accepting more international 
students, 
especially 
those 

who come directly from other 
countries, they are bringing the 
standards up. They can also get 
more tuition money from them 
too.”

Tsoi noted that international 

admissions 
and 
out-of-state 

admissions are more competitive 
than 
in-state 
admissions, 

allowing the University to accept 
superior applicants to increase 
ratings.

He also thinks, as Ishop 

mentioned, a significant reason 
for the increase stems from 
the desire of Asian students — 
particularly those from countries 
like China or South Korea — to 
come to American schools.

According 
to 
Tsoi, 
most 

students in China aspire to go to 
Peking University, the country’s 
top school, which he said is 
ranked lower than the University 
internationally. 
However, 
he 

said, it is incredibly difficult to 
get accepted.

“In order to get into a better 

college and also to compete in a 
less competitive area, they are 

trying to go to the U.S. or to the 
U.K. for college,” he said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Daria 

Belyaeva, 
an 
international 

student from Russia, said she 
didn’t think an increase in 
international 
students 
would 

serve the University’s rankings as 
much as it would serve funding.

“Michigan is a great, huge 

school in general,” she said. “I feel 
like we never had a huge shortage 
of international students. I feel 
like the financial aspect is more 
currently important.”

In addition to mentioning 

that her tuition has increased 
by 4 percent since last school 
year — as is consistent with 
the 
aforementioned 
tuition 

increase 
— 
Belyaeva 
noted 

that international students can 
receive very little money from the 
school through grants, studies 
or other special circumstances. 
Most international students, she 
explained, pay full tuition.

“This feels very unfair,” she 

said. “Obviously, it’s a state 
school, so why should I get stuff 
from the state of Michigan? 
But still it’s a crazy burden for 
international students.”

Engineering 
junior 

Madhav 
Sharma 
addressed 

the 
University’s 
engineering 

program specifically, noting a 
significantly larger international 
student 
population 
in 

Engineering than in LSA.

Looking at raw numbers from 

the aforementioned enrollment 
summary, Sharma noted the 
decrease in in-state enrollment 
between 2012 and 2016 — from 
24,095 to 23,095 — a small but 
evident 
decrease, 
given 
the 

increase in out-of-state students 
from 19,331 to 21,623.

“What I’ve heard from other 

students is that maybe the 
undergraduate 
admission 
is 

turning more to out-of-state 
students, because less financial 
aid can be given and more tuition 
can be collected,” he said.

organizational psychologist, 
because you can see his 
passion for the research he’s 
done,” Abad said.

Grant disagreed with the 

belief that seeking advice in 
the workplace makes them 
seem amateur. He discussed 
the importance of asking for 
advice, as it may further one’s 
goals and ideas.

Series host Jane Dutton, 

a

administration 
and 

psychology, 
said 
Grant’s 

efforts 
have 
improved 

attitudes toward relationships 
in the workplace.

“He’s really had a huge 

impact on the conversation 
in business and in work 
organizations,” she said.

This semester’s Positive

continue 
throughout 

January, 
February

from the Business School

include promoting a society

confidently, 
and 
building 

positive organizations and 
their impact on modern day

“I

about creating more life-

local activists, could come 
together 
and 
share 
their 

knowledge 
about 
sanctuary 

campuses while also answering 
questions from the community. 

Many students in attendance 

said they were proponents 
of making the University a 
sanctuary campus. LSA senior 
Jerry Graham said he thinks 
the change is an important one, 
adding it would benefit some of 
his friends and professors.

“This is something that I’d 

like to see for this campus,” 
Graham said. “I’ve spoken 
with a professor and friends 
that could really benefit from 
something like this, and that 
know people that could benefit 
from something like this. So I 
think it’s very important.”

The difficulty of working 

with both campus and city 
police in ensuring that the 
forces do not inadvertently 
inform 
U.S. 
Immigration 

and 
Customs 
Enforcement 

of 
undocumented 
students 

on 
campus 
was 
frequently 

discussed 
by 
speakers. 

Christine Sauvé, member of the 
Michigan Immigrant Rights 
Center, offered strategies to 
build a trusting relationship 

with the police.

“We have found, in Michigan, 

a lot of local police end up 
calling ICE or border patrol 
for their translation services,” 
Sauvé said. “So if your local 
police does not have something 
as simple as Language Link, 
which is very imperfect, even if 
they don’t have something like 
that, it could be something that 
pushes people to involve ICE 
and border patrol. Investing 
in language access is very 
critical for local communities. 
Community policing strategies 
and 
building 
that 
trust 

relationship 
with 
police 
is 

going to be critical.”

Another 
common 
theme 

evident throughout the teach-in 
was taking the meaning of the 
word “sanctuary” and making 
it a practical and operational 
concept to apply to the campus. 
Rackham 
student 
Vikrant 

Garg, a member of campus 
organization Students4Justice, 
said the University must make 
quantifiable 
policy 
changes, 

rather than merely applying the 
concept.

“For us, I think, as a 

campus, what we need to think 
about is how we’re going to 
operationalize what it means 
to advocate for a sanctuary 
campus,” Garg said. “It means 
tuition affordability, it means 

decreases in the cost of living … 
it means to actually take what 
sanctuary means, and turn 
it into an actual, operational 
definition.”

In a December interview, 

University 
president 
Mark 

Schlissel 
explained 
his 

hestitation to employ the term 
“sanctuary campus” due to its 
possible ambiguity.

“There’s 
some 
confusion 

about what that term means,” 
he said. “It’s a label that has no 
specific fixed definition and I 
don’t want to put a label on us 
that other people can define 
that may not be accurate.” 

Schlissel penned a statement 

in support of undocumented 
students in late November, while 
many University departments 
made 
resources 
available 

to members of the campus 
community in fear following 
the election of president-elect 
Donald Trump. Trump has 
repeatedly deemed executive 
orders signed by President 
Barack 
Obama 
protecting 

undocumented 
adults 
and 

children unconstitutional. 

“We already do many of 

the things that come under 
definitions 
of 
‘sancturary,’” 

Schlissel 
said. 
“We 
offer 

resources but don’t keep lists...
it maintains everyone’s privacy 
and safety.” 

SANCTUARY

A 

few years ago, a friend 
told me that she thought 
the world would be a more 

peaceful place without religion. 
Considering all the violence that 
has been committed in the name 
of religion, from the Crusades 
to 9/11, it’s an easy conclusion 
to draw. As a Catholic, though, 
the statement felt more like an 
accusation, and it stung.

I was raised Catholic and 

went to Catholic school for 
most of my life, so Catholicism 
is a central component of my 
identity. 
My 
Catholicism, 
my 

religion, always promoted love, 
tolerance, acceptance and peace. 
My religion taught me to value 
and cherish human life, so what 
does the Lord’s Resistance Army 
have to do with my Christianity? 
Fundamentally, I felt that the 
actions of others, in history 
and present times, could not 
define my religion. The way I 
understand Jesus, his actions 
and his message means that to 
me, human life is sacred and 
precious. 
Thus, 
anyone 
who 

claims to be Catholic but acts in a 
way that disregards that value of 
human life cannot be practicing 
my Catholicism.

For 
me, 
my 
faith 
means 

the opposite of violence and 
hatred. 
Having 
my 
religion, 

and by extension, my values, 
associated with the promotion 
of violence and intolerance was 
alienating and demeaning. The 
same is likely true for hundreds 
of millions of Muslims around 
the globe when their religion is 
deemed inherently violent by 
pundits, respected publications 
and the U.S. president-elect.

Recent 
attacks 
committed 

by terrorist organizations who 
preach a radical, violent version 
of Islam have seemingly brought 
the entire religion up for debate. 
The question of whether Islam 
is inherently violent has led 
to discrimination against and 
alienation of Muslims in the 
West. In France, where many 
terrorist attacks have occurred 
in the name of ISIS, towns have 
been banning Muslim women 
from wearing burkinis at the 
beach. 
Despite 
court 
rulings 

that mayors do not have the 
right to ban burkinis, several 
French 
mayors 
continued 

to enforce the ban. In the 
United States, as we know, our 
president-elect responded to the 
Orlando massacre by saying he 
“appreciate(d) the congrats on 
being right on radical Islamic 

terrorism” and reiterating his 
call 
to 
suspend 
immigration 

“from areas of the world when 
there is a proven history of 
terrorism 
against 
the 
United 

States, Europe or our allies.”

And 
so, 
fear 
begets 

discrimination. As one recent 
ISIS defector put it, “we were 
happy when Trump said bad 
things about Muslims because 
he makes it very clear that there 
are two teams in this battle: 
the Islamic team and the anti-
Islamic team.” Essentially, when 
more than 1.6 billion Muslims are 
grouped in with extremists and 
Islam is painted as violent, we 
are taking the bait and playing 
right into ISIS’s hands.

But, if Islam is not violent, 

how 
should 
we 
understand 

groups like ISIS? I think it’s 
useful to look at the intersection 
of violence and Islam the same 
way I viewed the intersection of 
violence and Christianity. Last 
semester, I took a class called 
“Anthropology of Islam,” and 
the more I learned about Islam, 
the 
more 
similarities 
I 
saw 

between Islam and Christianity. 
Both religions have sacred texts 
that are at times conspicuously 
violent 
because 
they 
are 

ultimately 
products 
of 
their 

times. But just as the Catholic 
Church 
promotes 
pacifism 

because it interprets the Bible 
in a more nuanced manner, so 
too do many Muslims interpret 
Islamic texts in more intelligent 
and holistic ways than ISIS does.

For example, I can read in 

Exodus 
35:2 
that 
someone 

who works on the Sabbath Day 
should be put to death, but I 
can recognize the endorsement 
of violence as an indication 
that violence was tolerated in 
6th-century 
B.C.E. 
Therefore, 

I prefer to focus on the Bible 
verses that encapsulate Jesus’s 
values 
and 
promote 
love, 

peace and understanding, like 
Galatians 
5:22-23: 
“The 
fruit 

of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, 
forbearance, kindness, goodness, 
faithfulness, gentleness and self-
control.” This isn’t just willful 
ignorance or selective reading; 
it’s an informed analysis that 
looks at the bigger picture. 
Similarly, cherry-picked quotes 
from Islam’s texts are used to 
justify violence, but these violent 
quotes entirely miss the point.

Since there is no Muslim 

equivalent of a pope who gets 
to have a final say on what 
the 
Quran 
means 
or 
what 

is 
considered 
Islamic, 
there 

are 
varied 
interpretations 
of 

Islam. Islam is shaped by those 
who practice it, and since it is 

practiced in different countries 
all over the world by people with 
different life experiences, there 
is a wide array of forms and 
understandings of Islam.

In 
fact, 
more 
than 
120 

Islamic scholars from around 
the world published a letter 
to 
ISIS 
saying: 
“You 
have 

misinterpreted 
Islam 
into 
a 

religion of harshness, brutality, 
torture and murder. This is a 
great wrong and an offense to 
Islam, to Muslims and to the 
entire 
world.” 
Importantly, 

these 
scholars 
used 
Islamic 

theological arguments to refute 
ISIS’s interpretation of Islam. 
As Nihad Awad, the director 
of the Council on American 
Islamic Relations said, “They 
have a twisted theology. They 
have relied many times, to 
mobilize 
and 
recruit 
young 

people, on classic religious texts 
that have been misinterpreted 
and misunderstood.”

The 
subjective 
nature 
of 

religion means that it often can 
be a reflection of each person, 
group and society that practices 
it. When I attend Mass in 
different areas, I often find that 
churches vary according to the 
values of each area. In Ann Arbor, 
for 
example, 
my 
experience 

at St. Mary’s Catholic Church 
has shown me a church that 
values social justice, promotes 
inclusion 
and 
is 
actively 

involved 
in 
the 
community. 

Other churches that I have 
attended, 
however, 
have 

pushed 
more 
conservative 

agendas. Religion manifests 
according to the social and 
cultural conditions in which 
it is practiced.

Thus, it stands to reason that 

religious violence says more 
about the area it emerges from 
than it does about the religion. 
ISIS, after all, does not exist 
in a vacuum. It emerged from 
the chaos and conflict in Iraq 
and Syria, and it continues to 
exploit these factors to gain 
power and control. So, when 
examining 
the 
intersection 

of 
religion 
and 
violence, 

we should not assume that 
correlation 
means 
causation. 

This means that we should look 
more critically at ISIS’s claims 
to Islam instead of taking their 
propaganda at face value. It 
also means that the solution to 
homegrown terrorism in the 
United States isn’t a blanket 
ban on Muslim immigration.

M

y family and I first 
decided 
to 
take 
a 

vacation 
to 
Hawaii 

in early 2008. It just so happened 
that these islands of paradise were 
also the birthplace of our newly 
elected president, a 
Black 
man 
named 

Barack 
Hussein 

Obama. And on this 
vacation to Hawaii, I 
recall the passion and 
enthusiasm of some 
Americans 
being 

grossly outweighed by 
the negative dismissal 
and 
condemnation 

others had toward our 
new president.

This 
was 
when 

I began to understand what 
resistance against our president 
meant. 
Eight 
years 
ago, 
my 

political views were misinformed, 
bordering 
on 
ignorant. 
My 

positions were rooted in the trust 
I placed in adults, alongside my 
lack of education. I was taught 
to believe our new president was 
more than dangerous — he was a 
threat to our way of life. Looking 
back now, the amount of content 
from the right dedicated to the 
condemnation 
and 
steadfast 

resistance to President Obama 
was staggering. Statements from 
individuals 
commanding 
large 

audiences like Rush Limbaugh, 
who hoped four days before the 
inauguration that Obama would 
fail, or the dedication of Fox News, 
which began a campaign of anti-
Obama stories prior to his first 
days in office.

And I, a 13-year-old on vacation, 

blindly developed an anger and 
hatred of a man solely because of 
my young mind’s susceptibility to 
propaganda. I distinctly remember 
being told that Hawaii wasn’t even 
his real birthplace, and like the 
adults around me who believed the 
same lie, I needed no evidence. I 
fell prey to propaganda and could 
have easily become one of the 
constant Obama-blamers we have 
all come to love on Facebook.

Yet, eight years later, my family 

and I returned to the islands 
of Hawaii, and as a testament 
to freedom of thought and the 
attainment of a proper education, 
I 
traveled 
this 
time 
reading 

“The Audacity of Hope.” It was 
extremely fitting, now eight years 
later and being enlightened to some 

extent, reading the 2006 words 
of a passionate and extremely 
optimistic Sen. Obama — while 
simultaneously 
watching 
and 

listening to the now departing two-
term President Obama comment 

on what he believed 
his 
administration’s 

success 
and 
failures 

were.

And 
what 
struck 

me most about the 
difference 
between 

President 
Obama’s 

two 
mindsets 
was 

the way in which he 
condemned, yet was 
somewhat 
impressed 

by, the audacity of 
the resistance against 

his platform exalting hope and 
change. The discipline and degree 
of 
precision 
that 
Republicans 

such as Mitch McConnell, John 
Boehner and Paul Ryan enforced 
over their party was incredible. 
During Obama’s term, Republicans 
executed plans for a lack of 
compromise and an unwillingness 
to work towards resolutions, while 
pandering towards an uneducated 
growing electorate being fooled by 
radical members of the right who 
have now ascended to power. 

Reading the optimism within 

“The Audacity of Hope,” I felt 
what many Americans must have 
in 2008 and 2009 — the feeling 
that this man had somehow 
developed the capability to push 
for 
rational, 
Democratic, 
yet 

centrist, measures to compromise 
and 
solve 
the 
several 
issues 

plaguing this nation. However, 
hearing President Obama speak 
recently to his ex-senior adviser 
David Axelrod on his podcast “The 
Axe Files,” his tired voice reveals 
the constant strain the attempts at 
progress have personally cost him 
over his eight-year tenure. Every 
step, action and moment of the 
administration 
was 
scrutinized, 

politicized and radicalized by 
an aggressive opposition, all in 
the name of defending their core 
party beliefs.

To what extent does defending 

your beliefs allow for lack of 
compromise 
or 
acceptance 
of 

the opposition? Whether it be 
through failing to fulfill your 
constitutional 
obligations, 
like 

in the case of the Senate not 
voting on Merrick Garland for 
the Supreme Court vacancy, or of 

Paul Ryan and the Republican-
led House, who engaged in the 
most aggressive gerrymandering 
in the hopes of minimizing 
Democratic influence — was this 
all done in the name of defending 
Republican beliefs? Or perhaps a 
better example would be Sen. Ted 
Cruz’s insane quest to default 
on our national debt unless we 
accept his beliefs on abortion?

That 
is 
the 
audacity 
of 

resistance. 
Republicans 

imposed a strict dogma upon 
their followers in the hopes 
of reclaiming the positions of 
power they once held, in order to 
impose dated ideas that have not 
only failed the American public 
but stagnated the progression 
of our society and economy as 
a whole. In the process they 
radicalized 
generations 
of 

Americans, even myself for a 
brief time, blatantly pandering 
to every irrational position and 
claim about a president who 
promised progressive change.

And now they have elected 

a man I have no fear calling a 
childish monster. A six-year-old 
with nuclear launch codes. A 
child who is the polar opposite 
of the man inaugurated eight 
years ago. And this is where 
I 
ask, 
how 
shall 
Americans, 

Democrats 
and 
Republicans 

alike impose a resistance against 
an administration that does in 
fact pose a threat to our nation? 
An 
administration 
that 
sides 

with foreign dictators over our 
own intelligence communities? 
An administration that elevates 
the 
reactionary 
“alt-right” 
to 

the uppermost levels of policy 
making 
within 
the 
White 

House? 
We 
as 
a 
collective 

citizenship should take a lesson 
from 
the 
uncompromising 

Republican party that sought 
oh-so-patriotically to “defend” 
and 
“protect” 
America 
from 

President Obama those eight 
years ago. The only way we 
can hope to once again enact 
those ideas found within the 
pages 
of 
“The 
Audacity 
of 

Hope” is through a strict and 
uncompromising 
resistance, 

checking our future president 
every step of the way.

The case for a six-team playoff

DAVID DONNANTUONO | OP-ED

N

ow 
that 
the 
college 

football 
season 
is 

officially 
over, 
I’ve 

begun to reflect on some of the 
debates I have had the past few 
weeks over the future of the 
postseason. I think we can all 
agree that whatever keeps the 
door open for more games, like 
Monday 
night’s 
all-time 
title 

rematch and last week’s Rose 
Bowl, is the way to go. After 
listening to a friend insist on the 
need for an eight-team playoff
 

and my dad suggest the return 
of a one and two seed title rather 
than an expansion of the playoff, 
I figured I’d throw my two cents 
out there.

Some argue that if a team isn’t 

among the top four in the country, 
why would they deserve to even be 
in the conversation? Not the worst 
point, especially given the past two 
title games have been between 
teams that would have faced each 
other regardless of there being a 
playoff in the first place. Others 
are adamant that an eight-team 

playoff is both the right thing to do 
and an inevitability.

Let me preface this by saying 

there are strong arguments for 
keeping 
the 
College 
Football 

Playoff as is, but here’s where 
my argument comes in: If an 
expansion of the CFP is in our 
future, there’s a right and a wrong 
way to do it. In my opinion, a six-
team playoff would preserve many 
of the elements that have made 
the current playoff such a success, 
while providing an answer to what 
it has left many of us to want. My 
vision is as follows.

Format

The format would include the 

top six teams in the country and 
a maximum of two teams from 
a single conference. This year, 
the six teams would have been 
Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, 
Washington, 
Penn 
State 
and 

Oklahoma. (Sadly, this structure 
would have still kept Michigan 
out of the playoff this year). That’s 
one from each of the five major 
conferences, and a second from the 
Big Ten, which was measurably 
the strongest conference at the end 
of the regular season.

Contrary 
to 
some 
people’s 

presumptions, 
Power 
Five 

conference champions should not 
be 
automatic 
qualifiers. 
Think 

of it this way: Had Alabama 
dropped this year’s Southeastern 
Conference 
championship, 
a 

three-loss Florida still wouldn’t 
have been worthy of a spot in the 
playoff. Instead, they would earn 
a Bowl Championship Series bowl 
over Auburn, and a 12-1 ‘Bama 
would remain in the playoff
 

as a high seed. Conferences 
would still be free to decide 
whether or not they schedule a 
championship game.

The one and two seeds would 

have byes while two quarterfinal 
games would be played in mid-
December between the three seed 
and six seed, and the four seed and 
five seed. From there, the playoff
 

would proceed as it stands. The 

top team would play the lowest 
remaining seed, and the two seed 
would play the other quarterfinal 
winner at the end of December 
or beginning of January. The 
championship would then occur 
on Monday the following week.

Arguments against an eight-

team playoff

When considering doubling the 

four-team field, there are a few 
realities one must accept. First 
and foremost, it would make other 
BCS bowls less meaningful, while 
diluting the playoff itself. With 
four quarterfinals on the same 
weekend, ratings for each game 
would likely drop (casual fans 
won’t watch 15 hours of football 
in one weekend), while both the 
caliber and prestige of BCS bowls 
not part of the playoff would lower. 
A six-team playoff would allow 
for two or three high-stakes BCS 
bowls, as they would still include 
the second-best teams of each 
conference (or the third best from 
the strongest conference in a 
given year).

Second, the top two teams in the 

country shouldn’t be given another 
additional 
postseason 
game 

against a lower-ranked opponent. 
Nick 
Saban 
would’ve 
been 

livid if his 13-0 Crimson Tide 
had been forced to add three-
loss Wisconsin to their already 
difficult path toward the title. The 
top two teams in the country 
should be rewarded for their 
consistency 
and 
dominance 

throughout the season.

Finally, it would lower the 

stakes for each year’s biggest 
rivalry games. With an eight-
team 
playoff, 
this 
year’s 

Michigan 
versus 
OSU 
game 

would have just been a battle of 
seeding, as opposed to the fight 
for a title.

ICE HOCKEY
Cecconi makes return 
to ‘M’ defensive unit

Joseph 
Cecconi 
doesn’t 

remember 
much 
of 
what 

happened after the final goal. 
What the sophomore defenseman 
does remember is skating from 
his team’s bench to its goal faster 
than he ever has before.

After Cecconi and the rest 

of the United States national 
junior team notched a 5-4 
shootout victory over Canada 
in the 2017 IIHF World Junior 
Championship, the post-game 
celebration could have been 
best described as raucous, and 
rightfully so — four long years 
had passed since the Americans 
last captured gold.

“(United States) hockey is 

getting better,” Cecconi said. 
“It’s always been good, but I 
think there’s more and more 
players who are getting better 
in this country and want to 
represent (the country).”

For Cecconi, the opportunity 

was the realization of a long-
time dream. He had made it his 
personal goal to play for the team 
since learning about it a few 
years ago.

The process of making the 

team was a long one. Cecconi 
first attended a camp with nearly 
40 other players last summer, 
before he was invited back 
before the tournament. Then, he 
made it past a final round of cuts 
to join the team.

Cecconi called the overall 

experience “fantastic”, and also 
said that the tournament gave 
him a chance to enter the second 
half of the season with some 
momentum.

In Canada, he also had the 

opportunity to play with some of 
the United States’ most talented 
players, such as Luke Kunin, 
Kieffer Bellows and Charlie 
McAvoy. After playing alongside 
so many elite players, Cecconi 
learned 
lessons 
from 
their 

different playing styles. The 
higher level of talent helped him 
improve his hockey IQ as well, 
among other aspects of his game.

“I think coming into the 

second half, I have a lot more 
confidence than I did in the 

first,” Cecconi said. “I did have 
confidence the first half of the 
season, but after playing in this, 
I feel like I’ll be an even better 
player for the team.”

Cecconi 
wouldn’t 
be 
the 

first Michigan player to heat 
up after returning from the 
tournament. Dylan Larkin and 
Zach Werenski each finished the 
season on a tear after playing for 
the United States in 2015 and 
2016, respectively.

Larkin had just three goals 

and 16 points before leaving for 
the World Juniors. After the 
tournament, he erupted for 12 
goals and 31 points — perhaps 
one of the reasons why his career 
at Michigan lasted only one 
season.

“(Larkin) was okay in the 

first half,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “Second half, he 
came back from that tournament 
and he played really well. He 
just took off. Put him right in 
Detroit.”

Werenski’s sabbatical from 

the Wolverines had a similar 
effect. The former defenseman 
wasn’t having the impact that 
Michigan had expected of him 
entering the season, but turned 
things around upon his return. 
After tallying just four goals and 
12 points before the tournament, 
Werenski posted seven goals and 
24 points after the break.

While Cecconi may not have 

the offensive ability of Werenski 
— he has posted just eight 
points in 54 career games — 
defensemen don’t need to put up 
points to be difference-makers, 
and Berenson believes Cecconi 
will still make an impact in his 
return to the team.

“When you play on a gold-

medal winning team and you 
realize what it’s like to sit in that 
locker room with guys that win 
and what it takes — and not that 
our team is far off the mark — 
but I think he’ll come back with 
an added confidence,” Berenson 
said. “Confidence in himself, 
confidence in how to play, and 
so on. And maybe he can add 
that to our defense corps — pride 
in defense, and how important 
it is to play good on defense. 
I’m hoping he’ll add that to our 
team.” 

Winning tight games essential
to Michigan’s postseason hopes

Last 
year, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team had 
ambitions of securing a berth 
in the NCAA Tournament. But 
in large part due to their six 
losses by ten or fewer points, the 
Wolverines fell short and were 
forced to settle for their third 
consecutive NIT appearance.

In one of them — a 77-69 

overtime defeat at the hands 
of Indiana last January — the 
Wolverines held a nine-point 
lead with four minutes to go in 
regulation yet were unable to 
sustain their lead in the most 
important moments.

On Tuesday, Michigan faced 

Indiana for the first time since 
that heartbreaker. Once again, 
the Wolverines held a nine-point 
advantage late in the fourth 
quarter. 

But 
this 
time, 
Michigan 

successfully found a way to 
close out the game. Senior guard 
Siera 
Thompson 
made 
four 

critical free throws in the final 
15 seconds to solidify a 78-74 
victory over the Hoosiers.

“That was a game we really 

talked about a lot last year,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico on 
WTKA 
radio. 

“Moving 
into 

this 
year 
and 

how we wanted 
to 
grow 
and 

how we wanted 
to improve, we 
knew 
closing 

out games like 
this was going 
to 
be 
really 

important. 
We 

found a way to 
inbound the basketball, which is 
something we struggled with in 
last year’s game.”

Thanks to the performance 

of sophomore center Hallie 
Thome, who notched her third 
double-double of the year with 
21 points and 11 rebounds, the 
Wolverines managed to secure 
the victory. 

More 
importantly 
for 

Michigan, 
she 
committed 

only one foul in the first half, 
which allowed her to play for 
36 minutes. In the Wolverines’ 
prior game — a 96-87 loss at 
No. 11 Ohio State — Thome was 
called for two fouls early in the 
second quarter, which forced 
her off the floor and allowed the 
Buckeyes to win the rebounding 

battle, 47-34.

With 

games 
against 

Minnesota, 
which 
sits 
in 

the top 30 in 
the 
Ratings 

Percentage 
Index, and No. 3 
Maryland on the 
horizon, keeping 
Thome 
out 
of 

foul trouble will 
be of the utmost 

importance for the Wolverines.

“That was the difference in 

the game,” Barnes Arico said on 
WTKA about the game against 
Ohio State. “At the end of the 
first quarter we were up 12-6 
in rebounding. We were really 
getting 
the 
second-chance 

opportunities. 
We’ve 
been 

working the past several days on 
becoming a better rebounding 
team, even when Hallie gets into 

foul trouble.”

Another 
key 
factor 
that 

Michigan will need to monitor 
as conference play progresses 
is the amount of playing time 
its reserves see. On Tuesday, all 
five of the Wolverines’ starters 
played at least 35 minutes.

While 
that 
arrangement 

worked 
for 

Michigan 
against 
Indiana, Barnes 
Arico 
knows 

that 
it 
is 
an 

unsustainable 
formula 
and 

promised more 
reserve 
action 

against 
the 

Golden Gophers 
on Sunday.

“I 
definitely 

think (the rotation) will be 
expanded again,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I think it depends a lot 
on matchups. We knew that 
Indiana would be a difficult 
matchup 
for 
some 
of 
our 

younger 
kids. 
They’re 
an 

experienced team that makes 
you pay for your little mistakes. 
I foresee as the conference 
schedule goes on, we’re going 
to have some more people that 

will get into the rotation and 
impact our team.”

One wild card the Wolverines 

have up their sleeve is the 
addition of senior center — and 
former volleyball player — Abby 
Cole, who Barnes Arico hinted 
may see the court in the near 
future. Cole, in addition to 

Thome, 
would 

give 
Michigan 

a 
favorable 

size 
advantage, 

especially 
on 

defense.

“We 
think 

(Cole) 
will 
be 

ready 
to 
go, 

hopefully within 
the next week,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said. 
“She’s 

just resting her 

legs and resting her shins after 
coming off of the last year of 
playing volleyball.”

Regardless of whether or not 

Cole plays anytime soon, the 
Wolverines will need to find ways 
to replicate their performance 
from Tuesday night in tight 
contests if they plan to reach 
the NCAA Tournament for the 
second time in Barnes Arico’s 
five-year tenure.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico has been emphasizing rebounding in the Wolverines’ practices as of late.

Michigan’s defensive problems 

start in the post

C

HAMPAIGN — The 
emergence of Moritz 
Wagner and DJ Wilson 

has given the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team an 
offensive 
dimension it 
hasn’t seen 
in the John 
Beilein era.

The forwards, who both have 

two years of eligibility remaining, 
have shown flashes of upside in 
their respective scoring abilities. 
Just over a week ago, Wilson 
hung 28 points on an Iowa team 
that couldn’t find an answer for 
stopping the 6-foot-10 redshirt 
sophomore. Wagner, too, had 
a solid 17-point performance 
against Penn State seven days 
ago.

But while much of the 

attention around the two 
forwards was centered around 
what the pair can add offensively, 
the defensive liabilities of 
Wagner and Wilson were 
severely underestimated.

The cracks have always been 

there, but have especially begun 
to show themselves since the 
start of Big Ten play.

Against the Hawkeyes, the 

Wolverines were a possession 
away from stealing a conference 
road win. But an offensive 
rebound and putback could have 
been prevented, or at least made 
more difficult, by having a big 
box-out below the hoop allowed 
Iowa to tie the game and send it 
to overtime.

Penn State and Maryland saw 

the defensive flaws the Hawkeyes 
had managed to unearth and 
built game plans around them. 
Nittany Lion forward Lamar 
Simmons and Terrapin forward 
Demonte Dodd were both key to 
their teams building substantial 
leads against the Wolverines in 
their own building.

With those performances 

in the past week, it wasn’t 
hard for Illinois to come up 
with the blueprint to expose 
the Michigan defense, but the 
degree to which the Fighting 

Illini dominated the interior is 
the most concerning.

Illinois attacked the 

Wolverines at the post early and 
often. Fighting Illini forwards 
Maverick Morgan and Leron 
Black scored Illinois’ first 10 
points jumpers and hook shots 
that Wolverine defenders allowed 
too much space on. Morgan, who 
entered Wednesday averaging 
9.4 points per game, finished the 
first half with 12 points on 6-for-7 
shooting.

Morgan simply outsmarted 

Michigan’s post defenders. He 
varied his shot selection, passed 
the ball out when he needed 
to and used 
his experience 
to outplay the 
defense.

“Everything 

they were doing 
out there we saw 
on film,” Wilson 
said. “They hit 
a lot of short 
rolls, 15-footers. 
(Morgan) in 
general, he was 
8-for-9 from the 
field and it felt 
like he didn’t 
miss one of those. We scouted it. 
We watched a lot of film. They 
just executed well.”

Physicality has also been 

an element of the Wolverines’ 
struggles down low, especially 
in the case of Wagner and 
senior forward Mark Donnal. 
Wagner has been timid in using 
his body and frame to box out 
and take on opponents crashing 
the boards, while, at 6-foot-9, 
Donnal is undersized at the 
position.

Michigan’s pair playing the ‘5’ 

had no rebounds in the first half 
and as a team the Wolverines had 
given up just as many offensive 
rebounds as defensive rebounds 
they grabbed themselves.

Those are the stats that will 

make winning any game in the 
Big Ten just about impossible.

Much has been made of 

Michigan’s struggles defending 
the perimeter the past couple 

games. The Wolverines are last 
in the conference in 3-point 
defense and had another 
concerning outing, allowing 
Illinois to shoot 64-percent from 
behind the arc.

But much of the Fighting 

Illini’s success shooting the ball 
from deep on Wednesday came 
from their plays in the paint.

Illinois forwards were 

drawing Wolverine perimeter 
defenders inside to play help 
defense, leaving guards open on 
the outside to make shots.

Morgan, again, was the one 

making this happen, and earned 
four assists on the night.

It’s hard 

to completely 
put the blame 
of Michigan’s 
defensive 
struggles solely 
on its post 
players, because, 
as tonight 
showed, they 
just don’t have 
the experience 
to matchup with 
mature Big Ten 
forwards.

Wagner and 

Wilson both started just their 
fourth Big Ten game Wednesday, 
and multiple times every game 
they seem to have forgotten 
their fundamental defensive 
principals.

That’s what’s been holding 

back the Wolverines’ defense the 
most.

And now it’s solely up to John 

Beilein and his assistants to solve 
a problem that is so simple to 
identify yet so hard to fix in the 
middle of a conference season.

“Our worst defensive teams 

were not like this,” Beilein said. 
“I don’t think schematically it’s 
anything to do with anything. 
We get there. We know where we 
are. But we don’t get there and 
guard people and effect people’s 
shots. It’s that simple.”

Wolverines blown out by Illinois in Champaign

CHAMPAIGN — After Illinois 

guard Te’Jon Lucas nailed a wide 
open floater — made possible by 
three Wolverines all guarding 
one man — 
to put the 
Fighting 
Illini 
up 

by 20 with 8:57 left in the game, 
Michigan men’s basketball coach 
John Beilein buried his head into 
his hands on the bench.

The play was indicative of a 

defensive effort that gave too 
much room for Illinois’ offense 
to operate as Michigan lost, 
85-69, on Wednesday night at 
the State Farm Center.

With both teams giving up 

over 78 points per game in Big 
Ten play, a high-scoring game 
was expected.

From the get-go, the two 

teams traded buckets, as both 
the Wolverines (1-3 Big Ten, 
11-6 overall) and the Fighting 
Illini amassed 1.3 points per 
possession in the first half.

Just like last Saturday against 

Maryland, 
Michigan 
couldn’t 

handle the opposing team’s big 
men. Illinois (2-2, 12-5) forward 
Maverick Morgan, who averages 
9.4 points per 
game, 
put 
up 

12 points in the 
first 
half 
on 

6-of-7 shooting. 
Morgan finished 
the game with 16 
points.

“Morgan’s 

really 
improved 
his 

game,” Beilein 
said. “I love the 
way they’ve developed him over 
time. Frankly, he hasn’t been 
a factor every time we played 
them in the past. ... The hook 
shots early hurt us, and that 
15-foot jumper; I don’t recall 
him making those in the past. 
We were playing off him, and 
he was great.”

The 
Fighting 
Illini 
also 

dominated the glass, grabbing 
16 rebounds (six offensive) to 
Michigan’s six (zero offensive).

“I did not like that our two 

biggest guys did not have 
a defensive rebound or an 
offensive rebound at halftime,” 

Beilein said. “And 
(Illinois forward 
Kipper Nichols), 
who barely made 
our 
scouting 

report, had four. 
The 
(defensive 

rebounding) was 
more troubling to 
me.”

Much has been 

said 
about 
the 

Wolverines’ weak 

perimeter 
defense 
through 

their first three conference 
games, and it wasn’t much 
better against Illinois. The 
Fighting Illini made 9-of-14 
from beyond the arc and shot 63 
percent overall.

Illinois 
stayed 
strong 

throughout the first half while 
Michigan 
faltered, 
and 
the 

Fighting Illini closed the break 
on a 17-2 run after senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. was given a 
technical foul to give the home 
team a 49-36 lead heading into 
halftime.

“I’ve coached Derrick for a 

long time,” Beilein said. “When 
I saw him do that, I couldn’t 
believe what I was seeing. He’s 
never done that, not in practice. 
I don’t think he can explain why 
he did that.”

Added Walton: “It’s inexcusable 

to kind of react like that. I 
understood the call, but it was 
costly to our team and I apologized 
to the ref and my teammates.”

Junior guard Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rakhman led the 
team with 12 points in the first 
half, but ended the game with 
just 14. Redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson was right 
behind him with 10 points in 
the first half, but unlike Abdur-
Rakhman, 
Wilson 
finished 

strong with a game-high 19 
points.

The second half didn’t start 

much better for the Wolverines, 
as Illinois scored on five of its 
first seven possessions while 
Michigan’s 
offense 
waned. 

The Wolverines shot just 37.5 
percent in the final stanza after 
finishing the first half shooting 
63.6 percent.

After 
Beilein 
said 
the 

Wolverines spent much of the 
week working on defensive 
fundamentals, he had hoped 
Michigan would answer against 
a team ranked 80th in the 
NCAA in scoring offense.

Instead, the Wolverines will 

travel home to Ann Arbor with 
many 
more 
questions 
than 

answers.

“People find a way to get 

open,” Beilein said. “When Lucas 
is 2-for-5 (from beyond the arc 
this season), and he banks one 
in, we’re not even surprised 
anymore. Kipper has not made 
a three yet. When he put it in, 
we’re not surprised anymore.

“The ball is just small and the 

basket’s real big when you’re 
playing Michigan right now.”

‘Lion’ flawed but evocative

UofMixtape: Cold Open

Oscar bait is a funny thing, 

isn’t it? The notion of film 
for the purpose of awards 
attraction 
is 
troubling, 
not 

only because the film’s quality 
may be affected 
by 
studio 
or 

distributor 
attempts to make 
it more palatable 
or 
moving, 
but 

because the entire 
content of a film is 
dependent on its 
supposed “social 
importance.” 
Consider 
the 

advertisements 
that 
appeared 

across 
Los 
Angeles 
before 

the 
Oscars 
in 
support 
of 

“The Imitation Game,” the 
2014 biopic of gay computer 
science pioneer Alan Turing. 
“Honor this man,” read the 
advertisement. But that’s not 
the film’s fault (though, no 
doubt, the screenplay, with 
its repetitive “inspirational” 
platitudes, had Oscar gold on 
its mind); the problem with the 
Oscar bait-centered criticism 
is that it can deride a perfectly 
good movie.

“Lion” might be one of those 

movies — which is a shame, 
because 
it’s 
emotionally 

powerful and well-constructed, 
and doomed to a marketing 
campaign 
that 
directs 

filmgoers to see this movie 
because 
it’s 
an 
Important 

Movie. “Lion” begins a few 
decades ago in an Indian slum, 
where 
Saroo 
(the 
aborable 

young newcomer Sunny Pawar) 
becomes separated from his 

brother 
at 
a 
train 
station. 

Saroo goes looking for his big 
brother and ends up napping 
on a stationary train, which 
later begins to move across the 
country. Saroo, lost in Calcutta, 
where the natives speak Bengali, 
not Hindu, bounces from a home 
to a group of children on the 

street to, finally, 
an 
orphanage, 

from which Saroo 
is 
later 
adopted 

by 
the 
Brierley 

family, a couple 
from 
Australia 

(Nicole 
Kidman, 

“Genius,” 
and 

David 
Wenham, 

“300: Rise of an 
Empire”).

The first half of 

“Lion” is some of 

the best filmmaking of the year. 
Pawar’s performance is riveting, 
perhaps because he doesn’t fall 
for any of the typical mistakes 
child actors do, namely line 
recitation rather than acting. 
Pawar is not only convincing 
as 
the 
young 
Saroo, 
he’s 

captivating. So is his brother, 
Guddu (another first-time actor, 
Abhisek Bharate), but he’s given 
considerably less screen time, 
understandably. Greig Fraser’s 
(“Rogue One: A Star Wars 
Story”) cinematography is partly 
responsible, transforming an all-
too-typical cinematic image of 
Indian poverty (see: “Slumdog 
Millionaire”) into breathtaking 
storytelling. It’s all the more 
surprising that the film was 
directed by Garth Davis, who 
only has a few short films under 
his belt, and no feature films. 
Davis demonstrates a mastery 
of the camera, especially in the 
first half, that should serve as a 
calling card for years to come.

“Lion” 
finds 
its 
premise 

in the second half, where a 
20-something 
Saroo 
(Dev 

Patel, “The Man Who Knew 
Infinity”) — adorned with a 
mane of long hair that, perhaps, 
hints at the film’s title — has 
all but renounced his Indian 
heritage, proudly boasting his 
Australian upbringing. But it’s 
the mid-2000s, the inception 
of the information age, and 
when someone mentions Google 
Earth, then new, the idea of 
locating his home strikes at 
Saroo. The film thus becomes 
a procedural, long takes of 
Saroo obsessively working on 
his 
computer, 
mapping 
out 

the region and possible train 
routes. He descends into a sort of 
chaotic fugue state; he becomes 
aggressive towards his girlfriend, 
Lucy (an uncharacteristically 
bland Rooney Mara, “Carol”). 
He doesn’t get along with his 
adopted 
brother, 
also 
from 

India, who did not adjust as 
well twenty years before. The 
second half is stuffed with these 
tropes of procedural drama, 
and it proves rather distracting. 
Screenwriters (in this case, Luke 
Davies, who also wrote last year’s 
“Life”) often must take dramatic 
liberties with source material, 
but must it be so melodramatic?

But the power of “Lion” is 

indisputable. 
Its 
emotional 

potency is in no small indebted to 
its heartbreaking subject matter 
— just imagine mysteriously 
losing your family with no 
closure — but Davis’s direction, 
far 
superior 
to 
Davies’s 

screenplay, breathes life into a 
fascinating story, which could 
have made for an otherwise 
achingly dull movie in another 
director’s hands.

Quality 16

What you have here, folks, is 

one hour and fourteen minutes 
of frustration, sadness, and 
longing (in more or less that 
order). The finest collection 
of melancholy this side of 
the Mississippi, if I do say so 
myself. These are the songs 
that soundtrack my late walks 
in the falling snow — the less 
visibility, the better. This is the 
music in which I find comfort 
during long drives, the snow 
not only piled high on the sides 
of the road, but obscuring the 
street itself, challenging our 
tax dollars to wake someone up 
at three or four or five in the 
morning so that we don’t lose 
our minds come morning rush 
hour.

The 
playlist 
begins 
with 

harsher 
sounds 
— 
the 

unforgiving 
guitar 
riff 
on 

“Sister” is a recent favorite, 
Cloud 
Nothings’ 
distorted 

power-punk album features a 
cover reminiscent of a ski lodge 
(a detail that has always had 
an important bearing on how I 
hear their music), the bombast 

of Preoccupations’ “Continental 
Shelf” features chunky guitars 
and 
stark 
production, 
and 

Will Toledo’s work as Car Seat 
Headrest is pleasantly fuzzy 
lo-fi.

Songs by Ypsilanti-local Fred 

Thomas 
and 
The 
National-

soundalike 
Black 
English 

provide 
the 
transition 
to 

acoustic, where Pedro The Lion 
begin the “sadness” portion 
of the ‘list. The 
Microphones’ 
“I 
Want 
Wind 

To 
Blow” 
is 

an 
unhurried, 

cluttered 
piece, 

juxtaposed 
with 
the 
quiet 

urgency of Super 
City’s “Run The 
Home.” 
Next, 

we 
introduce 

quiet urgency to 
electric guitar (and a full band) 
with Rainbow Kitten Surprise’s 
poignant “Cold Love” — just 
wait for those harmonies in the 
final minute.

From here, we enter the 

“longing” portion, beginning 
with a chamber-pop detour 
featuring the likes of Stars, 
Beirut, and San Fermin, as well 

as a track by Owen Pallett (whose 
work is appropriate in context, 
but too experimental for me to 
comfortably label “chamber-
pop”). Net we have an arguably 
indulgent pair of songs, “Too 
Much” by Sampha — a piano-
and-vocals-only version of the 
Drake song (which Sampha 
helped write and produce) — 
and “Sweet Chin Music” by 
Milo, a whimsical downbeat 

rap that casually 
samples a Bon 
Iver song.

Rounding 

out 
the 
final 

fourteen minutes 
is 
the 
glitchy 

“Murmurs,” the 
hollow-sounding 
“Chamakay” 
with 
its 
oddly 

dark 
vibe, 
the 

excellent, pared-

down 
“Chinatown” 
from 

Girlpool’s even more excellent 
2015 debut and, finally, “Coldest 
Night of the Year,” by Vashti 
Bunyan (probably most well 
known for her collaboration 
with 
Animal 
Collective), 
a 

track which I’ll readily admit I 
may or may not have tacked on 
for novelty.

Do you ever experience 

that feeling when you open 
your 
refrigerator 
to 
find 

that you have absolutely no 
desire to make what you 
would normally make with 
the items before you? Does 
a gloom settle over you? Do 
you then pray to the food 
gods for inspiration to strike, 
awaiting the deliverance of 
an 
important, 
life-altering 

culinary message from above?

I found myself precisely 

in 
this 
position 

just 
a 
few 
days 

ago, staring into a 
refrigerator packed 
with items I had 
no 
right 
moping 

over. But just as 
you 
look 
into 
a 

bursting 
closet 

without 
a 
clue 

what to wear, you 
may find yourself 
looking into your 
food supplies at a 
standstill — feeling 
hungry and lackluster. 

But just as this feeling 

began to settle in, growing 
more pressing with each growl 
emitted 
by 
my 
frustrated 

stomach (if it could talk, it 
would have probably said 
“Just feed me already”), an 
idea took form in my head — 
a beautiful, appetizing idea. 
At that moment, I decided to 
make pierogis. 

Yeah, I bet you didn’t see 

that coming. 

Some 
people 
have 

photographic memory; most 
people, like myself, have just a 
normal memory. But because 
it’s in my nature to constantly 
be thinking about food, I have 
a peculiar habit of recalling 
bygone recipes at a moment’s 
notice. 

This time, I remembered 

seeing a recipe for caramelized 
onion and mushroom pierogi 
that had stood out to me while 
browsing the many appetizing 
recipes concocted by online 
food bloggers. I remembered 
that the dough seemed fairly 
easy, 
requiring 
just 
flour 

and yogurt (in addition to 
the eggs, water, oil and salt I 
already had on hand). I also 
remembered that it sounded 
freaking amazing, and long 
ago, I had tucked it away in 
some abandoned bookmark 
or Pinterest board like the 
countless 
other 
recipes 
I 

excitedly resolved to make 
before saving them for later. 

So, after the recipe that 

had faded from my memory 
suddenly 
sprung 
back 
to 

mind, I got to work 
by assembling my 
already 
available 

ingredients before 
making the little 
Polish 
dumplings. 

Pierogis remind me 
of 
my 
grandma’s 

kreplach (a Jewish 
dumpling 
filled 

with 
meat), 
only 

layered 
and 

typically filled with 
potato and cheese 
instead. 
Perhaps 

the methods of preparation 
are similar, but they both 
comprise the collection of old-
school recipes brought over 
by families from countries 
outside the U.S. and passed on 
through generations. Therein 
lies the essence of comfort 
food, and the appeal of both 
making and consuming the 
pierogi. 

The 
dough 
required 

surprisingly minimal effort 
and was easy to handle (aside 
from my practiced pie dough 
making, 
I’m 
pretty 
much 

doomed when it comes to 
dough). I sautéed my onions, 
garlic and mushrooms in a pan 
before adding the spinach and 
letting the leaves wilt in the 
pan of steaming vegetables. I 
took a lot of liberty with this 
step of the process, opting 
to stray from the recipe’s 
filling and make a simplified 
version suited to my own taste 
instead — adding goat cheese 
and spinach in place of the 
prerequisite mashed potato. 

Finally, the pierogi dough 

was ready to be rolled out, cut 

into circles using (what I think 
was clean — it’s sometimes 
hard to tell in our kitchen of 
seven) glass and carefully 
dealt a spoonful of stuffing 
before 
being 
folded 
over 

into their familiar crescent 
shapes. 
With 
mounting 

anticipation (the water could 
not have taken longer to boil) I 
carefully dropped my pierogi 
into the salted, bubbling water 
and watched as, one by one, 
they lazily floated up. 

Then, after scooping them 

out and letting them rest, I 
fried them in a generous pat 
of sizzling butter until they 
crisped up to a nice golden 
brown. And after less than 
an hour’s work, I had a whole 
tray of savory mounds of fried, 
mushroom filled dough to 
show for my efforts.

Though 
delicious, 
the 

doughy pockets aren’t the 
moral of this mouth-watering 
tale. I had, in an instant, been 
transported to another world. 
One where I could access 
memories, tastes and feelings 
that are otherwise unavailable 
to me. And all because I had, 
in the depths of complacency, 
decided to do something to 
counter the immobility that 
comes with feeling uninspired 
and weary. 

People generally shy away 

from 
the 
unknown, 
idly 

resigning 
to 
the 
familiar 

ease of a meal repeatedly and 
unceremoniously 
prepared. 

While there’s nothing wrong 
with this, it’s the very habit 
that we vow each January to 
spur in favor of something 
new and better. It’s the time of 
year again when we all resolve 
to do something different. 

So, maybe start with the 

small changes that seem more 
daunting than they really are. 
Do 
something 
differently. 

Make 
something 
different. 

And 
even 
if 
your 
dough 

betrays you and tears as you 
fold a particularly overstuffed 
dumpling, at least you tried 
and can feel assured that 
you’re better for it. 

New year, old pierogies

This is the music 
in which I find 
comfort during 

long drives

Emotional drama shines in its first half but a change in storytelling 
approach leaves the film’s cumulative impact marred in melodrama

Vivienne Westwood
This 
was 
Westwood’s 

first men’s show ever on the 
London schedule, but it would 
be silly to call it just a show 
for men. Her runway showed 
both men and women wearing 
everything 
from 
double-

breasted, 
broad-shouldered 

suits 
to 
garish 
dresses. 

Westwood’s collections have 
been fairly adventurous for 
as long as I can remember, 
but this collection may take 
the cake in terms of blurring 
the gender normative lines of 
clothing with men in dresses 
and miniskirts. 

One of the themes that 

was 
ever-apparent 
during 

this collection was the sea of 
faces printed onto garments: 
faces from puppets, comical 
faces and even what looked 
like Westwood’s own face. All 
in all, this collection felt like 
a day spent at the carnival, 
and sometimes that sort of 
whimsical look is just what 
you need.

 

Craig Green
Recently crowned British 

menswear designer of the 
year, 
Craig 
Green 
doesn’t 

miss a beat jumping into his 
Fall 2017 collection. This feels 
like 
Green’s 
furthest 
dive 

into textures and fabrics like 
wool and fleece — which were 
heavily used in this collection. 
When viewing this collection, I 
personally threw the question 
of “Could I see myself wearing 
this?” out the window. Not 
because it doesn’t feel wearable, 
but because when looking at an 
outfit, it’s a bit difficult to tell 
how many distinct garments 
are being worn, but that’s a 
common theme with Craig 
Green’s shows.

I started asking myself what 

sort of story this collection told. 
All of the looks felt particularly 
utilitarian: 
Some 
models 

were wearing helmets while 
others wore what can only be 
described as body armor. What 
is this looming doomsday or 
battle that many of his models 
seem so adequately prepared 
for? Maybe it’s a war or maybe 
it’s just the general dismal 
feeling in the air these days.

 

J.W. Anderson
Simply put, this collection 

was a lot of fun. From the 
barrage 
of 
colors, 
to 
the 

crocheted 
patches, 
pockets, 

scarves and sleeves. It all makes 
me want to call up my mom and 
ask her to break out the crochet 
hook and make me a cool patch 
for a sweater so I don’t have to 
spend my rent money on one of 
these when they drop.

One thing, for me, was 

that this collection felt quite 
wearable in general (which 
can be refreshing). When I 
first viewed the collection, I 
remember thinking to myself, 
“Wow, I could totally see 
myself wearing this” on many 
occasions, which was certainly 
more difficult to say during 
the Craig Green and Vivienne 
Westwood 
collections. 
This 

collection 
confirmed 
two 

things for me: that oversized

the b-side
Thursday, January 12, 2017 — 3B

This week Daily Music writers 

look back at — and reconsider — 
less modern pieces of music.

On his 2005 track “The Food,” 

Common wonders aloud about 
sincerity in rap, questioning “if 
it’s for the art or for the dough.” 
It’s a critical distinction, staying 
away from the material mindset, 
and it’s one that was echoed just 
a year later by fellow Chicagoan 
Lupe Fiasco.

Fiasco has made a career out 

of distinguishing the “real” from 
the inconsequential. A Chicago-
born Muslim, he visibly carries 
both of these characteristics 
with him, channeling their 
relevancy 
into 
a 
heartfelt 

characterization of himself. As a 
result, he has the voice, for he is 
a real one, embracing positivity 
and flipping negativity on its 
head, essentially functioning 
through 
purposeful 

compartmentalization. 
2006’s 

Food & Liquor is the first sign of 
this. His studio debut operates 
in dichotomy — rebellion and 
conformity, 
sin 
and 
virtue, 

optimism and pessimism, good 
and bad.

In effect, he pulls off a rare 

feat, one we might today call the 
Kendrick formula, only before 
Kendrick. Exuding an air of 
cool, calm and collectedness 
in light of otherwise gloomy 

circumstances 
–– 
shattering 

perceptions of how to tackle 
obstacles that just might not be 
institutionally conquerable.

But, maybe they are. Because, 

maybe, 
Lupe 
can. 
Amidst 

characteristically 
grandiose 

production, with blaring strings 
and Jill Scott’s forceful hook, 
the poised Lupe shines. He 
neglects an idealized Chicago, 
instead describing a grimmer 
reality: 
“Now 
there’s 
hoes 

selling hoes like right around 
the toes / And the crackheads 
beg at about the lower leg,” he 
tells us. “There’s crooked police 
that’s stationed at the knees / 
And they do drive-bye like up 
and down the thighs.”

This locality lends itself to 

universal social consequence, 
and the result is home-cooked 
poetry that manifests as a 
unique brand of “cool.” With 
fresh retrospect this Chicago 
cool becomes more apparent. 
It’s the same self-assured cool 
that 
produced 
a 
president 

who pumps out Al Green at 
fundraising events and almost 
nails “Sweet Home Chicago” 
in the White House. The same 
worldly cool paved the way to 
stardom for Chance the Rapper 
(“Lil Chano from the 79th”), 
later 
acknowledging 
that 

influence by returning to help.

Though abstract in nature, 

what begins earnestly quickly 
turns 
— 
appropriately 
— 

preachy. In “Real,” it morphs 
into adversity-defining (“Just 

Might Be OK”). “Kick, Push,” 
shrouded in production similar 
to that on “Daydreamin’,” comes 
across as a coming-of-age tale 
(“When things got crazy they 
needed to break out, they’d 
head / To any place with stairs, 
any good grinds the world 
was theirs”). Humanizing the 
youth through skateboarding 
anecdotes, 
Fiasco, 
in 
turn, 

continues an impossibly subtle 
yet effective narrative of hope.

Food & Liquor, Fiasco and 

the collective ethos behind 
both is helplessly, yet positively 
foundational in nature. For 
many, the magic of Food & 
Liquor is just how formative 
it proved to be. It enlightened 
and resonated with those inside 
and, most impressively, those 
outside. Through it all, Lupe 
had the proverbial swagger, in 
a time when it was culturally 
relevant 
to 
exhibit 
— 
no, 

trailblaze — such a thing.

Even at its most vulnerable, 

like 
the 
dead 
ends 
and 

brokenness of “Hurt Me Soul,” 
there’s substance, comforting 
overtones 
and 
lingering 

glimmers 
of 
confidence. 

Accompanied 
by 
a 
sound 

(though eventually repetitive) 
that proves ahead of its time, 
the rebelliousness — the cool 
factor — anchors Food & Liquor. 
A timeless album that examines 
while it tells, it thrives in the 
organic, making it engaging for 
nearly every genre of listener.

Have you heard Imagine Dragons latest single?

When it comes to The School 

of Music, Theatre, and Dance’s 
annual Collage Concert, not 
a seat in the house is left 
empty. Every year 3,500 people 
saunter into Hill Auditorium 
to soak up the brilliance of 
this 
concert’s 
mosaicism. 

Highlighting 
and 
combining 

the University’s 
large ensembles 
with 
the 

top 
student-

comprised 
groups, 
the 

Collage 
Concert’s 
inclusion of all 
aspects of SMTD 
makes 
for 
a 

riveting, diverse 
performance.

Through a very selective 

application 
and 
audition 

process, 
eight 
student 

ensembles 
were 
chosen 
to 

showcase short performances 
that will be integrated into 
the 
program, 
alongside 

the 
University 
Symphony 

Orchestra, 
the 
University 

Choir, 
Jazz 
Ensemble 
and 

University Symphony Band. 
With hardly a minute between 
each different performance, 
the 
exhilarating 
continuity 

keeps 
the 
audience 
on 

their feet, while spotlights 
illuminate 
different 
areas 

of the auditorium back to 
back, cueing the next piece to 
immediately begin after the 

antecedent.

“It goes from one end of the 

spectrum to the other. It’s a 
great ride — you’ll go from a 
mass orchestra piece, to a folk 
duet, to a dance piece,” said 
Janet Lyu, a senior violinist in 
the School of Music, Theater 
and Dance. “It’s a night of a lot 
of stimulation.”

In addition to performing 

in Collage with 
the 
University 

Symphony 
Orchestra, 
Lyu 

is 
one 
of 
five 

student 
liaisons 

for 
the 
school. 

When 
applying 

for the job, Lyu 
specifically 
had 

Collage in mind 
as 
something 

she 
particularly 

wanted to be a 
part of.

“It’s really special to me,” 

Lyu 
said, 
regarding 
why 

Collage is one of her favorite 
concerts 
of 
the 
year. 
“It 

proves that this school is not 
your 
typical 
conservatory. 

It’s a great coming together 
of community. There’s really 
nothing like it — a lot of schools 
copy the model that we have. It 
brings me a lot of pride to be a 
part of.”

Lyu, who will be performing 

in Collage for her sixth time, 
is excited for the audience to 
feast on the wide variety of 
performances.

“It’s a wild showcase,” Lyu 

said. “It’s one of the only times 
in the year where the entirety 

of SMTD gets together on a 
complete level. All different 
genres and all different aspects 
of the school get a chance to 
showcase themselves — not 
just to the audience, but to each 
other.”

Every year, all the numbers 

are 
unique. 
There’s 
quite 

an 
assortment, 
including 

incorporation 
of 
different 

instrumentation, 
electronic 

music and theatre skits; the 
Collage 
Concert 
aims 
to 

challenge the norm of typical 
University performances.

“They’re constantly trying 

to make it exciting,” Lyu said.

This 
year, 
the 
Collage 

Concert will spend part of 
the evening paying tribute 
to the man who originally 
brought the idea of Collage to 
the University, Gustav Meier. 
Meier, who passed away in 
May 2016, was the professor 
emeritus 
of 
conducting 
at 

SMTD for 19 years.

Additionally, because 2017 is 

the University’s Bicentennial, 
performances will showcase a 
few pieces that were written 
the year the University was 
founded 
to 
celebrate 
its 

inception.

“I think that Collage is a 

great array of different pieces 
and a great focal point of 
pushing the boundaries of 
our art. It’s a beautiful way of 
tasting everything SMTD has 
to offer in a compact and fun 
way,” Lyu. “There are so many 
different people on stage, yet 
at the same time, we’re all 
representing the same family.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

ALLIE TAYLOR
Daily Arts Writer
 Migos have a lot to celebrate 
at the moment: after years of 
fighting their way through 
hip-hop’s underground and 
trekking toward a commercial 
peak, they 
finally seem 
to be on top 
of the world. 
Next week, 
the rap 
supergroup 
will release 
its second LP, “Culture,” while 
the album’s first single, “Bad 
and Boujee (featuring Lil Uzi 
Vert),” will hopefully continue 
its reign as the number one 
song in America. So, it should 
be no surprise that amidst their 
current hype, Quavo, Takeoff 
and Offset are celebrating like 
kings, and in the new visuals 
for the third single off of 

“Culture,” entitled “T-Shirt,” 
the three emcees do so in high, 
wintry style.
The music video for “T-Shirt” 
finds Migos towering atop a 

snowy mountain 
and dressed 
in full-fur 
wardrobes that 
seem to take style 
tips from both 
Cam’ron and 
Leo’s Revenant. 

Quavo, Takeoff and Offset, who 
are also wearing royal amounts 
of jewelry, dance, bounce and 
floss in their quintessentially 
braggadocios ways while each 
delivers an ice-cold verse in 
the group’s staple start-and-
stop flow pattern. Eventually, 
attractive women and race-
ready snowmobiles arrive 
without any precedents at 

all, as do brief glimpses of a 
luxurious cabin, all of which 
seems to insinuate that the 
rap group has conquered 
the wilderness and turned it 
into their own comfortable 
playground, much like they did 
with the streets, then the rap 
game.
“T-Shirt” and its extravagant 
visuals might have arrived 
just in time to prolong Migos’ 
residency in pop’s spotlight. 
It also is pretty random, as it 
never explains why they’re on 
that mountain, like at all. But 
that’s okay. Quavo, Takeoff and 
Offset standing there in all of 
that fur — that’s iconic. That’s 
culture. Digital culture at least. 
That’s why “T-Shirt” is perfect.

It’s time for some game theory.

Entirety of SMTD to come together for showcase this Saturday evening


4B — Thursday, January 12, 2017
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

This 
week 
Daily 
Music 

writers 
look 
back 
— 
and 

reconsider 
— 
less 
modern 

pieces of music.

In 
elementary 
school, 

Sunday mornings were known 
as golden mornings to me in 
a way that stood completely 
independent of the weather 
outside. 
Golden 
mornings 

existed nowhere else but my 
kitchen, where my parents 
liked to lounge after eating 
a late breakfast and where 
Norah Jones made herself at 
home. There wasn’t a Sunday 
morning that went by without 
her invisible presence filling 
the empty seats at our table.

I used to perch myself on the 

countertop and observe, with 
utter tranquility: the quiet 
rustle of newspapers turning, 
the gentle murmur of my 
parents’ voices curving around 
steaming mugs of coffee and, 
most 
importantly, 
Norah 

Jones’s voice flowing out of 
speakers as her album Feels 
Like Home played on repeat. 
With the sun reaching out 
from behind clouds, her voice 
seemed to paint the walls of our 
kitchen in shades of gold. Even 
in the dead of winter, when the 
snow that clung to the windows 
bleached the world outside into 
a monochromatic bleakness, 
our kitchen on those Sunday 
mornings never failed to glow 
with warmth. Music melted 
over my sleep-heavy limbs 
like the honey my dad liked to 
spread over his toast, filling 
every corner of our kitchen 
with tarnished sweetness.

So intertwined are Norah 

Jones’s harmonies with those 
Sunday mornings that when I 
listen to Feels Like Home today, 
nearly 13 years later, I am once 
again in that sun-drenched 

kitchen, filled with the same 
serenity I felt then. Feels Like 
Home isn’t just an album to me; 
it’s a collection of memories, 
holding between its notes and 
rhythms a reflection of my 
family’s Sunday morning sliver 
of paradise.

Like Norah Jones filling the 

cavity of my kitchen, music in 
general, I’ve come to realize, 
quietly fills the spaces in life 
that you didn’t even notice 
were empty; it weaves itself 
into the very underlining of 
an experience, embellishing 
and shaping the details around 
harmonies and melodies.

My kitchen holds the weight 

of many songs. For me, Norah 
Jones digs her way through the 
floorboards like a sunflower. 
For my mother, the song of 
her youth travels through the 
steam that emerges when she 
is cooking. In the hours before 
dinner is served, she likes to 
sometimes play the song out 
loud for herself as shadows 
begin to stretch across the 
floor. The bruising violet of the 
dusky sky outside 
perfectly matches 
the 
song’s 

haunting 
vocals. 

She 
explained 

to me once that 
her song is one 
of revolution, of 
childhood 
hope 

and 
resistance 

during 
dark 

times. 
To 
me, 

it’s 
beautiful, 

but to her, it’s something else 
entirely; the song folding in on 
itself to reveal an assortment 
of reminiscences so powerful 
that when listening, she has to 
close her eyes against the ache 
of remembering.

A lifetime has passed since 

she 
last 
heard 
its 
melody 

reverberate among the rolling 
slopes in the mountains of her 
adolescent home, but I know she 

will never forget the memories 
irrevocably stained by this 
song. I know because her face 
as she listens to the familiar 
notes is continually distant. 
She is instantly transported to 
a place I don’t dare trespass. 

The influence of a simple 

song lies in this: In the utter 
depth of memories it has the 
potential to hold, in the way 
it is simultaneously both a 
finished piece of music and 
also an empty canvas laying 
bare, waiting for listeners to 
splatter their own input over 
its unfilled expanse. When 
we flee to the long-standing 
songs of our past for solace, 
for strength, for bittersweet 
nostalgia, we don’t seem to 
be seeking out the comfort of 
the song itself but rather the 
various memoirs trapped in its 
notes. With music, the stories 
of the past are easily brought to 
mind.

For my mother, these stories 

are substantial and compelling. 
For me, Norah Jones brings 
about a simpler, gentler kind 

of recalling. It 
is something I 
turn on when 
the cold makes 
even my bones 
start to wither 
away. 
When 

I 
can 
barely 

bring to mind 
what the inside 
of my kitchen 
looks like with 
light 
spewing 

from the walls like a mosaic; 
when I notice myself spending 
more time in bed, heavy with 
an 
unexplained 
loneliness, 

drained with an unexpected 
sadness. I turn on Feels Like 
Home and allow myself to be 
enveloped in the kaleidoscopic 
memories of bygone golden 
mornings.

ALL THINGS RECONSIDERED

“Hag-Seed” 
is 
Margaret 

Atwood’s latest masterpiece. It 
is not only a modern retelling of 
Shakespeare’s “The Tempest,” 
but revolves around that play 
as well. At times, it’s hard to 
believe that the same person 
who orchestrated the somber 
drumbeat of “The Handmaid’s 
Tale,” or the hypnotizing pulse 
of “Surfacing,” has penned the 
frenetic third person narration 
in this novel, but Atwood 
once again smoothly reveals a 
deftness of craft 
and the power 
that the art of 
storytelling has, 
no matter the 
vehicle or venue. 

“Hag-Seed” 

follows 
the 

story of Felix, 
who 
considers 

himself 
an 

avante-garde 
director and misunderstood 
genius. Some consider him 
eccentric; others view him 
as essential to the Canadian 
theatre festival; a few consider 
him 
a 
nuisance. 
While 

wrapped up in his artistic 
visions of a bold retelling of 
“The Tempest” — including a 
possibly paraplegic Caliban 
and a cape for Prospero sewn 
out of plush animal skins — the 
signs of a mutiny by his right 
hand man go straight over his 
head. 

After Felix is ousted, he 

opts for self-banishment. He 
lives alone for years, before 
stumbling into a position that 
he never would 
have considered 
at the peak of 
his 
career 
— 

bringing theatre 
to 
felons. 
He 

grows 
to 
love 

it, 
wearing 

a different identity in the 
prison, enjoying the romantic 
anonymity and the opportunity 
to delve into Shakespeare’s 
work with those whom society 
has largely forgotten. Felix 

eventually 
learns 
of 
an 

opportunity 
for revenge too 
satisfying 
to 

pass up — which 
includes putting 
up his beloved 
production 
of 

“The Tempest” 
— 
and 
takes 

full 
advantage 

of it. Felix holds all the 
similarities between himself 
and Prospero close to his 
heart, even maintaining an 
unsettling relationship to his 
dead daughter Miranda. This 
relationship takes precedence 
over 
his 
relationship 
with 

reality, which is often tenuous 
at best.

“Hag-Seed” includes not only 

two stunning interpretations 
of “The Tempest,” but witty 
barbed pop culture references, 
including 
the 
Illuminati, 

political correctness and kale. 
Atwood’s strongest prose is not 
the economical storytelling in 
which the plot unfolds neatly 

(for 
the 
most 

part) but the rare 
moments in which 
we are allowed a 
prolonged glimpse 
into Felix’s own 
introspection and 
uncertainties. 

The relationship between art 
and grief is prominent, but 
it’s shown not only as a venue 
to solace but to spiraling into 
desperation. The arc of how a 
person goes from frightening 
themselves with their own 
delusions to relying on them is 
eerie, but Atwood draws it in 
one steady hand.

Some of the themes — how 

do we create our own prisons, 
and how do we find our way 
out of them— may seem kitschy 
when laid forth plainly, which 
is why Atwood’s weaving them 
under plot, over subplot makes 
them work. 

 “Hag-Seed” is part of an 

initiative by the publishing 
company Hogarth to release 
a series of novels based on 
Shakespeare’s most beloved 
texts, but the intent to reinvent 
is subtle. Like Felix, Atwood 
has somehow succeeded at 
something highly improbable: 
taking a text already thought 
to 
have 
been 
thoroughly 

exhausted 
and 
breathing 

something new into it.
