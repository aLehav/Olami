W EST LAFAYETTE
- Welcome to the
place where inter-
ceptions fall into Michigan
hands as if dropped from a
" cloud. Where the Michigan
linemen can dictate games.
Where good just might be good
enough.
After wandering for four games
in the non-conference desert,
Michigan can finally see the
promised land. Football fans,
welcome to the 2012 Big Ten.
It's a strange place here, one
where Denard Robinson's
toughest decision is to try to

score or
duck out of
bounds and
avoid a hit.
Here, the
ineffective-
ness of a cer-
tain tailback
matters not, ZACH
nor does a HELFAND
kicker that
just doesn't
have the legto hit from far out.
Here, Michigan dominates the
line of scrimmage. It started
with the offense's first touch.
Robinson rushed for a modest

five yards, and all of a sudden,
78-yards and 8:48 of game time
had gone by and there was
Fitzgerald Toussaint, pounding
the ball in for the score, 7-0.
The drive was 17 plays of line-
men colliding and Robinson
checking down and Toussaint
grinding for a short gain. No
play went for more than 10
yards, save a facemasking pen-
alty on Purdue's Kawann Short.
This isn't Bo Schembechler's
Big Ten, and it wasn't exactly

he was disrupting the potent

At a conference Friday
morning held at the Michigan
Union, Samuel Zell, chairman
of the Equity Group Invest-

for the world economy.
Speaking to about 200 busi-

the audience that opportuni-

combination of European fiscal
weaknesses, slowgrowth inthe
developing world, government
investment in the private mar-

"What is private equity?"

Despite the crisp fall air
Saturday morning, individu-

Rackham Auditorium where

journalists, authors and pub-

their area of expertise, while
students integrated themselves
into the folds of the conversa-

State of the Book symposium,
was the beginning to the day-
long celebration of literature.
The event consisted of a
series of panels, performances
and speakers that included some
of Michigan's most notable
writers, such as fiction writer

Charles Baxter and former U.S.
Poet Laureate Philip Levine.
Local booksellers and repre-

selling work from predominant-

STATUE OF LIMITATIONS
TO REPORT SEXUAL MISCON-
DUCT ELIMINATED
Duke University announced the
elimination of a statute of limitations
for reporting sexual misconduct, the
Duke Chronicle reported Sunday.
The statute of limitations, the
time in which students can report
misconduct, was eliminated due to
student pushback.
Larry Moneta, Duke'svice president
for student affairs, wrote in an e-mail
to students: "The discussions about the
statute of limitations have brought to
light our need to continue our aggres-
sive approach to minimizing sexual
harassment and assault at Duke."

Libyan parliament ousts
prime minister in vote

No-confidence
vote comes after
overthrow of
Gadhafi

Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi waves to the crowd gathered for a speech marking the 1973 war with Israel.
Egypt's new president gives
h imself high grades in speech

Leader is first freely
elected president of
Egypt
CAIRO (AP) - Egyptian
President Mohammed Morsi has
given himself high grades on his
handling of some of the nation's
pressingproblems,spendingmuch
of a nearly two-hour speech late
Saturday talking in painstaking
detail about fuel, trash and
bread, while sidestepping key
issues in the nation's transition to
democratic rule.
But the speech in many ways
was also as much about style as
it was about substance, and the
61-year-old Morsi, the first freely
elected president in Egypt's
history, used his address to
project the image of an energetic
leader in touch with the needs of
the people. That appeared aimed
at drawing a sharp contrast with
his 83-year-old predecessor,
Hosni Mubarak, who was widely
perceived in the waning years of
his long rule as out of touch with
reality.
Morsi, who hails from the
Muslim Brotherhood, the
country's largest and best-
organized political group, made
a slew of promises during his
campaign, vowing to end Egypt's

fuel shortages, improve the
quality of the heavily subsidized
bread, check surging crime,
clean the streets of trash and
ease traffic congestion.
Speaking to a crowd of tens
of thousands in Cairo at Egypt's
largest sports stadium, Morsi
claimed that scientific methods
used to gauge progress on the
five issues gave him a success
rate of 80 percent on bread, 60
percent on traffic, 40 percent on
garbage collection, 85 percent on
fuel and 70 percent on security.
But he also sought to stress
the magnitude of the challenges
he faces, and hit back at critics
who charge that he was spending
too much money and time
traveling abroad and that his
habit of offering Friday prayers
at a different mosque every week
was costly and disrupted traffic
on what is supposed to be the
quietest day of the week.
He said his nine foreign trips
to date - Saudi Arabia (twice),
China, Iran, Belgium, Ethiopia,
Turkey, the United States
and Italy - secured for Egypt
pledges of billions of dollars of
investment and monetary aid
and that his Friday prayers,
which entails the deployment
of hundreds of policemen and
troops, were cost free.
"I am still living in a rented

apartment," he said to bolster
his argument that he was not
abusing his authority. "If anyone
sees me driving a new car that
is not owned by the state should
report it."
"They are trying to find a hole
in a seamless white dress," he
said of his critics. "We have a
glorious future ahead of us."
But his speech touched only
in passing on the simmering
dispute over the drafting of a new
constitution. Liberals, women
and minority Christians say the
process has been hijacked by
Morsi's fellow Islamists. He also
did not touch on the restrictions
that critics say have been placed
on freedom of expression in the
three months since he took office
and the return of abuses by the
police - documented by human
rights groups.
Morsi also offered no vision for
the future of the nation, where
nearly half of its estimated 83
million people live below or
just above the poverty line. He
declared himself married to the
fight against corruption, but
offered no ways to improve basic
services such as medical care,
education or housing for the poor.
The president's critics
remained unimpressed, by both
the speech and the successes he
touted in it.

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -
Libya's parliament ousted the
country's new prime minister in
a no-confidence vote on Sunday,
the latest blow to hopes that
political factions could agree
on a government charged with
restoring stability after last
year's civil war.
Mustafa Abushagur was
the first prime minister to
be elected after the 2011
overthrow of dictator
Moammar Gadhafi. He
represented an offshoot of the
country's oldest anti-Gadhafi
opposition movement, and
was considered a compromise
candidate acceptable to both
liberals and Islamists.
But his proposed Cabinet
was struck down by a
legislature representing
dozens of divided tribes,
towns, and regions across
the country, many of whom
feel they are owed the spoils
of victory over Gadhafi. He
was forced to withdraw
his first ministerial line-
up under pressure and his
second attempt to submit one
resulted in his ouster.
In a short statement on
Libya al-Wataniya TV after
the vote, Abushagur said he
respected the decision made
by the General National
Congress as part of Libya's
democracy but warned of
instability if it takes too long
to elect his replacement.
"There should be quickness
in the election of the prime
minister and formation of the
government so the country
does not slip into a vacuum,"
he said.
Hehad25daysfromhis Sep.

the legislature's approval,
but that deadline expired on

A

125 to 44 in favor of removing
him as prime minister, with 17
abstaining from voting. He had
just put forth 10 names for key
ministerial posts Sunday when
the no-confidence vote was
held.
Until a replacement can
be elected by the parliament,
management of Libya's
government is in the hands of
the legislature.
The Congress will have to
vote on a new prime minister
in the coming weeks. The
incoming leader will be

The pharmacy that distributed
a steroid linked to an outbreak of
fungal meningitis has issued avol-
untary recall of all of its products,
calling the move a precautionary
measure.
The New England Compound-
ing Center announced the recall
Saturday. The company said in
a news release that the move
was taken out of an abundance
of caution because of the risk of
contamination. It says there is no
indication that any other products
have been contaminated.
The Food and Drug Admin-

American artist's
mural vandalized
A vandal scrawled graffiti on a
mural by modern American mas-
ter Mark Rothko at London's Tate
Modern on Sunday.
The mural, one of Rothko's
Seagram series, was defaced
when a visitor to the Tate applied
"a small area of black paint with
a brush to the painting," the gal-
lery said.
A photograph posted on Twit-
ter by a gallery visitor showed
words, including the name Vladi-
mir, scrawled in the corner of
the painting. The gallery, which
attracts 5 million visitors a year,
was briefly closed Sunday after
the incident.
The graffiti on the painting
also appears to read "a potential
piece of yellowism." According to
an online manifesto, Yellowism is
an artistic movement run by two
people named Vladimir Umanets
and Marcin Lodyga.

MOSCOW
Putin comments
on Russia's issues
in documentary
Russian President Vladi-
mir Putin said in a first-person
documentary aired on his 60th
birthday Sunday that the current
generation of opposition lead-
ers needs to be cast aside and he
brushed aside concerns the two-
year jail sentence for punk bank
Pussy Riot was too severe.
The documentary that aired
Sunday portrays Putin as a tireless
and no-nonsense leader contemp-
tuous of domestic and internation-
al criticism.
Putin says in the program that
he welcomes opposing views, but
that they should come from people
willing to take responsibility for
running the country.
Celebrations took place Sunday
all over Russia to celebrate Putin's
birthday, although the Kremlin
has said the president opted for
low-key celebrations with friends
and family.

Daily wire reports

France ups security at
Jewish religious sites

Cmdr. Jeffrey Self, of U.S. customs and Border Protection, flanked to his left by Acting Chief Patrol Agent Manuel
Padilla, releases a statement on Friday at the Tucson Sector Headquarters in Tucson, Ariz.
Agent who died last week
was killed from friendly fire

Ivie thought two
other agents were
drug smugglers
PHOENIX (AP) - The U.S.
Border Patrol agent killed last
week in a shooting in southern
Arizona apparently opened fire
on two fellow agents thinking
they were armed smugglers and
was killed when they returned
fire, the head of the Border
Patrol agents' union said Sun-
day.
The two sets of agents
approached an area where
a sensor had been activated
early Tuesday from different
directions early Tuesday and
encountered each other in an
area of heavy brush, National
Border Patrol Council president
George McCubbin said.
Agent Nicholas Ivie appar-
ently opened fire first and
wounded one of the other
agents but was killed in the
return fire.

"I don't know what it was
he saw or heard that triggered
this whole event," McCubbin
said. "Unfortunately it resulted
in his death and another agent
injured."
Acting Cochise County Sher-
iff Rod Rothrock confirmed the
scenario but would not say if
Ivie was the first to shoot, say-
ing that was up to the federal
agencies involved.
The new details add to a FBI
statement Friday that the shoot-
ing appeared to be a friendly
fire incident that involved no
one but the agents.
Sensors are set up in differ-
ent areas along the U.S.-Mexico
border to detect smugglers or
illegal immigrants, with Bor-
der Patrol agents responding
when they're set off. The shoot-
ing occurred in a rugged hilly
area about five miles north of
the border near Bisbee, Ariz.,
an area known for illegal traf-
ficking.
McCubbin and Rothrock
both said the two sets of agents

knew the others were heading
to the area on foot but appar-
ently didn't know they were so
close. McCubbin said he'd been
briefed by the agency, while
Rothrock's agency has been
involved with the investigation.
"It was dark, very, very rug-
ged terrain, and what they
could see of each other was fur-
ther obscured by the fact that
there was brush and cacti and
stuff like that between them,"
Rothrock said. "I have no doubt
that these agents were in as
heightened a state of alert as
you can get due to the proxim-
ity to the border and the history
of trafficking in that area."
Rothrock said that when the
agents spotted each other in
the dark, "they apparently took
defensive postures, which was
probably interpreted as aggres-
sive postures. Like readying
your weapons, for example."
Ivie, 30, died at the scene,
and one of the other agents was
wounded but has since been
released from the hospital.

Turkey, Syria exchange artillery
mortars for fifh consecutive day

Damascus gives
unusual apology,
fighting continues
AKCAKALE, Turkey (AP)
- Turkey and Syria fired artil-
lery and mortars across their
volatile border for a fifth con-
secutive day on Sunday, in one of
the most serious and prolonged
flare-ups of violence along the
frontier.
The exchange of fire stoked
fears that Syria's civil war will
escalate into a regional con-
flagration drawing in NATO
member Turkey, once an ally of
President Bashar Assad but now
a key supporter of the rebels
fighting to topple him.
Turkish Foreign Minister
Ahmet Davutoglu warned on
Saturday that Ankara would
respond forcefully to each
errant Syrian shell that lands on
Turkish soil.
Ankara's warning was cou-
pled by an apparent diplomatic
push by the Turkish leadership
to promote Syrian Vice Presi-
dent Farouk al-Sharaa as a
possible figure to head a transi-
tional administration to end the
conflict in the country.
In an interview with Turkish
state television TRT Saturday,

Davutoglu said that al-Sharaa
was a figure "whose hands are
not contaminated in blood" and
therefore acceptable to Syrian
opposition groups.
Al-Sharaa, 73, a close associ-
ate and longtime loyalist to the
Assad family, has been a contro-
versial figure since the start of
the uprising.
He appeared in public in
late August for the first time in
weeks, ending repeated rumors
that he had defected. The
regime has suffered a string of
prominent defections in recent
months, though Assad's inner
circle and military have large-
ly kept their cohesive stance
behind him.
Early on in the uprising, the
Syrian president delegated to
al-Sharaa, a skilled diplomat,
responsibility for holding a dia-
logue with the opposition. A
Sunni from the southern town
of Daraa, birthplace of the Syr-
ian uprising, al-Sharaa's silence
since the start of the uprising
made him a prime candidate for
rumors that he broke with the
regime.
Meanwhile, there was little
sign that the exchange of fire
near the border, although still
at a fairly low level, was ebbing.
It began five days ago when a
Syrian shell killed five civilians

in a Turkish border town. Tur-
key's parliament subsequently
approved a bill that would allow
cross border military operations
there.
Damascus offered a rare
apology, but shells and mortar
rounds continue to fly into Tur-
key.
On Sunday, an Associated
Press journalist witnessed a
round landing some 200 meters
(yards) inside Turkey, near the
border town of Akcakale. A short
time later, eight artillery shells
could be heard fired from Turkey.
In the Turkish town of
Akcakale, mayor Abdulhakim
Ayhan said shrapnel from the
Syrian mortar round caused
some damage to a grain depot,
but no one was hurt. He con-
firmed that Turkish artillery
immediately returned fire.
Inside Syria, forces loyal to
Assad clashed with rebels across
the country, from the northern
city of Aleppo to the southern
border with Jordan, killing
according to activist groups at
least 90 people across the coun-
try. Activists said opposition
fighters were strengthening
their hold over the village off
Khirbet al-Jouz, in the northern
province of Idlib, which borders
Turkey and where violent clash-
es broke out a day earlier.

SpaceX sends
supplies, ice cream
to astronauts
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
- A commercial cargo ship rock-
eted into orbit Sunday in pursuit
of the International Space Sta-
tion, the first of a dozen supply
runs under a mega-contract with
NASA.
It was the second launch of
a Dragon capsule to the orbit-
ing lab by the California-based
SpaceX company. The first was
last spring.
This time was no test flight,
however, and the spacecraft car-
ried 1,000 pounds of key science
experiments and other precious
gear. There was also a personal
touch: chocolate-vanilla swirl ice
cream tucked in a freezer for the
three station residents.
The company's unmanned
Falcon rocket roared into the
night sky right on time, putting
SpaceX on track to reach the
space station Wednesday. The
complex was soaring southwest
of Tasmania when the Falcon
took flight.
Officials declared the launch a
success.
In more good news, a piece of
space junk was no longer threat-
ening the station, and NASA
could focus entirely on the deliv-
ery mission.
NASA is counting on private
business to restock the space sta-
tion, now that the shuttles have
retired to museums. The space
agency has a $1.6 billion contract
with SpaceX for 12 resupply mis-
sions.
Especially exciting for NASA
is the fact that the Dragon will
return twice as much cargo as it
took up, including a stockpile of
astronauts' blood and urine sam-
ples. The samples - nearly 500
of them - have been stashed in
freezers since Atlantis made the
last shuttle flight in July 2011.
The Dragon will spend close to
three weeks at the space station

before being released and para-
chuting into the Pacific at the end
of October. By then, the space
station should be back up to a full
crew of six.
None of the Russian, Euro-
pean or Japanese cargo ships
can bring anything back; they're
destroyed during re-entry. The
Russian Soyuz crew capsules
have limited room for anything
besides people.
Space Exploration Technolo-
gies Corp., or SpaceX - owned by
PayPal co-founder Elon Musk - is
working to convert its unmanned
Dragon capsules into vessels that
could carry astronauts to the
space station in three years. Other
U.S. companies also are vying to
carry crews. Americans must ride
Russian rockets to orbit in the
meantime, for a steep price.
Musk, who monitored the
launch from SpaceX Mission
Control in Hawthorne, Calif.,
called the capsules Dragon after
the magical Puff to get back at
critics who, a decade ago, con-
sidered his effort a fantasy. The
name Falcon comes from the
Millennium Falcon starship of
"Star Wars" fame.
An estimated 2,400 guests
jammed the launching center to
see the Falcon, with its Dragon,
come to life for SpaceX'sfirst offi-
cial, operational supply mission.
It was no apparition.
"Just over a year since shuttle
retirement, to be able to do that
is, I think, what people are very
excited about," said NASA's dep-
uty administrator, Lori Garver.
Across the country at SpaceX
headquarters, about 1,000
employees watched via TV and
webcast.
SpaceX is shooting for its next
supply run in January.
Another company looking to
haul space station cargo, Vir-
ginia's Orbital Sciences Corp.,
hopes to launch a solo test flight
in December and a demo mis-
sion to the station earlynext year.
ruled that the men had no more
grounds for appeal and could be
sent to the U.S. immediately.

Michigan shouldn't sacrifice welfare for attendance
n Oct.1, the Michigan Department of Human Services imple-
mented a new law in an attempt to ensure consistent class-
room attendance by students ages six to 15. The law stipulates
that any student who accrues 10 or more unexcused absences in a sin-
gle school year renders their family ineligible for state welfare. This
initiative fails to take multiple extenuating factors into account and
may inadvertently punish families and students for circumstances
beyond their control. Furthermore, it's counterintuitive to make the
welfare of entire households contingent on a single student's atten-
dance, since students depend on the food and rent government assis-
tance affords to maintain a healthy attendance record.

(Im)polite politics

f you're like many politically-
aware students at our uni-
versity, you probably spent
last Wednesday
night snuggled
in front of the
television ready
to watch the
first presidential
debate between
Mitt Romney
and President
Barack Obama. SARAH
Youleftthe UGLi SKALUBA
early, maybe
even skipped
Wine Wednesday, with big hopes of
gaininginsight into the various pol-
icies of the Republican presidential
nominee and the incumbent.
We wanted fierce debate. We
wanted to leave our couches with
an understanding of exactly where
Romney and Obama stand on differ-
ent issues and how they each plan to
drag our bruised nation out of the
economic shambles in which it's
found itself.
But it didn't take long to realize
we set our hopes too high. Much
too high. In fact, it felt like I was
watching a passive-aggressive
squabble between two suburban-
ites, rather than a presidential
debate. Poor Jim Lehrer clearly
didn't have any power to mediate
the discussion, and seemed to act
as more of a comic figure than an
actual moderator.
Beneath the layers of political
rambling, unanswered questions
and blatant lies, however, is an
extremely interesting idea regard-
ing debate etiquette. Or maybe
debate tradition, for lack of better
words.
Let's be honest, we know that
Romney and Obama are far from
close pals. They're fighting a nasty
battle withless than amonthuntilthe
ultimate winner is finally announced
and the loser can walk away with his
tail between his legs. They trash each
other's policies, approve humiliating

commercials and spend whatever
it takes to make the opponent look
absolutely awful.
From this perspective, the sly
smiles and uncomfortable greet-
ings between the candidates prove
noteworthy. They raise the ques-
tion: Is this staged performance
and fagade a product of debate tra-
dition, or the realization of an ever-
growing animosity between two
distinct political parties?
The performance was prefaced
by a dramatic introduction thanks
to Lehrer, the poor fellow who was
talked over, cut off and pretty much
completely ignored throughout
the 90-minute ordeal. He began
the night by saying, "The audience
here in the hall has promised to
remain silent. No cheers, applause,
boos, hisses - among other noisy
distracting things - so we may all
concentrate on what the candidates
have to say." (Although in this case,
it apparently wasn't much.)
After Lehrer announced the
"house rules" the candidates
strolled on stage, smiles gleaming
and arms outstretched to greet the
audience and eventually each other.
It doesn't take a psychology major
to gauge the immense tension that
permeated this handshake and the
uncomfortable feelings the candi-
dates shared.
Maybe, just maybe, this fagade
is used to show a united front that
crosses party lines and connects
all Americans. However, as Nov. 6
nears, the divide between parties
is continuously growing and each
side seems to be moving further
and further in opposite directions.
The two candidates did greet each
other on stage with a stark smile
and handshake, though just how
genuine these gestures were is up
for further debate.
In "girl world," passive aggres-
sion is the sneakiest form of aggres-
sion out there. It's being nasty,
without actually bearing fangs. It's
the ability to be sly, without coming

across as an angry, psychotic bitch.
And in the political realm, from
what I saw Wednesday 'night, this
doesn't change much.
Debates have
a passive
aggressive
undertone.
President Obama introduced
himself and wished his wife a
happy anniversary in front of mil-
lions of viewers, only to be outdone
by a rather feisty Romney. The
Republican nominee proclaimed,
"And congratulations to you, Mr.
President, on your anniversary.
I'm sure this was the most roman-
tic place you could imagine here
- here with me, so I - congratula-
tions." Well, wasn't that chock-full
of uncomfortable undertones.
The presidential debates are a
hybridized performance. One part
competitive game, two parts dra-
matic performance, topped off with
enough unspoken tension to make
even the meanest mean girl seem
like an angel. So yes, the majority of
the claims made by each side were
false, none of our questions were
actually answered and at times we
forgot we were in fact witnessing a
serious political debate.
But this just leaves more room for
us to ponder the social etiquette and
underlying tension of this historic,
American tradition. Although we'll
never know exactly what either can-
didate is thinking as he scribbles
notes down and smiles eerily during
his opponent's turn to talk, I don't
think it takes much imagination on
our part to fill in the blanks.

According to The Detroit News, reoccur-
ring truancy is a serious problem among lower
income families and can result in a domino
effect of negative behaviors such as dropping
out of school, criminal activity and jobless-
ness. In 2012, Robert Balfanz, a Johns Hop-
kins University researcher, said "poverty is
the main driver of absenteeism," meaning it
can ultimately determine why and how often
a student is truant from school. If they fail to
adhere to this new rule, low-income families
will be deemed ineligible for any state welfare
assistance.
According to The Detroit News, "hunger,
transportation, lack of proper school uniforms
and sexually transmitted diseases" are among
the most cited reasons for truancy. Since the
mitigation of these obstacles to consistent
attendance largely depends upon a lower-
income family's ability to apply for and receive
welfare, it's unfair to respond to unsatisfac-
tory attendance by depriving families of the
resources they need to ensure attendance.
The law is especially troubling when con-
sidering that at many schools, a student's out-
of-school suspension will count against them
as an unexcused absence. This means that a
student who attends school but commits an
offense worthy of suspension could put his
entire family's welfare eligibility in jeopardy.
Other schools require a student's presence in
homeroom for them to be counted present for
the entire day, meaning a student who attends
school regularly but arrives an hour late on any

givendaycouldsimilarlydisqualifytheirfamily
from assistance. Parents can't necessarily hold
their child's hand all the way into the building,
either. A student could potentially step off the
bus and abscond without their parents' knowl-
edge. Such offenses should not be put entirely
on parents who value their child's education
and encourage their consistent attendance. No
law should grant a wayward student such inor-
dinate power to determine the future wellbeing
of their family.
Rather than punishing parents by threaten-
ing their family's welfare status, schools should
focus on improving the quality and marketing
of their educational services to students and
their parents. It's more effective to incentivize
good attendance - by emphasizing the avail-
ability of engaging coursework for students
and opening communication between parents
and teachers - than it is to punish poor atten-
dance. The state could also consider raising a
family's maximum welfare eligibility by a small
percentage if a student maintains satisfactory
attendance for a predetermined amount of
time.
While Michigan's rising levels of truancy
demand a swift and decisive response, link-
ing welfare eligibility to student attendance
may exacerbate the problem by withholding
the basic resources families need to ensure
their children are on the bus each day. The
state should revert to policies that incentiv-
ize proper attendance, rather than punish the
lack of it.

Tuesday is the voter registra-
tion deadline in the state of
Michigan. But never mind
that. This col-
umn isn't about
the election.
You're smart,
you're busy.
You're the
I-have-no-time-
to vote student. I
don't need to lec-
ture you on the DANIEL
importance of CHARDELL
voting in general
or in this election
in particular. I don't need to remind
you that your vote will determine our
next president, the balance of power
in Congress and the guiding philoso-
phy at the helm of our politics for the
next four years. I don't need to tell
you that we have four Supreme Court
justices in their mid to late seventies,
or that their imminent retirements
may put our next president in a posi-
tion to drastically alter the political
leanings of the bench. Who cares
that the Supreme Court will soon be
ruling on the most contested social
issues of our time? It's also not worth
mentioning that Supreme Court jus-
tices will outlast the president who
appoints them - just one of the many
ways we live with the legacies of
presidents after they leave office.
But we're not going to talk about
all that, because this column isn't
about the election. Besides, I know
life isn't easy for you, the I-have-
no-time-to-vote student. It's an
election year, and you're a U.S. citi-
zen above the age of 18. People irra-
tionally expect you to vote. As the
election approaches, you're inevi-
tably bombarded with an unend-
ing supply of e-mails, commercials,
editorials, celebrity-sponsored
PSAs and student campaign vol-
unteers hounding you on all four
corners of the Diag, all demanding
that you register to vote. With all
the noise people make about vot-
ing, you'd almost get the impression
that it's meaningful or something.
But don't worry. Those daily
reminders to participate in your
democracy will disappear soon
enough (I predict no later than Nov.

6), and then you'll be free to think
about topics outside the election
as much as you want. In the mean-
time, I won't subject you to more
election talk.
And does it really matter which
candidate you vote for, anyway?
After all, President Barack Obama
and Republican presidential nomi-
nee Mitt Romney have so much in
common. Obama believes in a pro-
gressive tax code. Romney believes
in taxing progress. Obama wants to
balance the budget through a com-
bination of discretionary spending
cuts and modest revenue increases.
Romney will fix the global econo-
my by defunding PBS and Planned
Parenthood. Obama is an advocate
of the DREAM Act and humane
immigration reform. Romney's
polygamous great-grandfather
lived in Mexico. Obama has two
young daughters. Romney is con-
stantly toying around with an Etch
A Sketch. Obama supports same-
sex marriage, repealed "Don't
Ask Don't Tell" and opposes the
Defense of Marriage Act. Romney
has this one gay friend, Richard
Grenell, who served as Romney's
national security spokesman. Well,
until Grenell resigned just one
week after his appointment under
pressure from leaders on the far
right who took issue with his sexu-
ality. Regardless, Obama and Rom-
ney are basically the same person.
So let's not talk about the elec-
tion anymore. Never mind your
moral obligation to vote. It's not
like young people across the Mid-
dle East are dying in their efforts to
depose tyrannical regimes. It's not
like American 18-year-olds spend
their youth in uniform defending
the freedoms you're hardly aware
you have. It's not like untold num-
bers of nameless, faceless individu-
als have sacrificed themselves for
your chance to cast a ballot. Right?
Why should you bother?
I hope you're enjoying this not-
about-the-election chat as much
as I am. If anything, people need
to understand that the average
I-have-no-time-to-vote student is
the real victim. How can we possi-
bly set aside 10 minutes to vote for

a president once every four years
when we're already so busy check-
ing Facebook, watching football
and doing other important non-
election things? It's unreasonable
to expect so much of us. I under-
stand that you, a student with no
time to vote, faces discrimination
every day. Those volunteers on the
Diag aren't asking you if you're reg-
istered to vote because they want
you to fully exercise your rights.
No, they do it because they're jeal-
ous you're above all this voting
stuff. They don't understand you.
But I do, and I commend your arro-
gance. That's why this column is
absolutely not about the election.
There's no time
to vote when we
have to check
Facebook.
And besides, even if you wanted
to vote, registering is too compli-
cated to understand. There's defi-
nitely at least one form involved in
the registration process. Well, I say
that's one form too many. We're just
college students! Sure, we'll ace that
exam in organic chemistry. But ask
us to complete a simple survey of our
basic information? That's beyond us.
We'd probably just go cross-eyed
at the sight of it. No, better leave
all that to the seasoned voters, the
elderly. Their interests can't be too
different from yours, right?
As an I-have-no-time-to-vote
student, you're exhausted con-
stantly telling people why you're
too busy to register and vote. But
this is the home stretch; the dead-
line for Michigan voter registration
is Tuesday. So stay strong! Hold
your head high! You only have to
complain about not having time to
vote for one more day.

South Korea to obtain
longer-distance missiles

Agreement with U.S.
likely to upset
N. Korean officials
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- South Korea will be able to
possess longer-range missiles
capable of hitting all of North
Korea under a new agreement
with the United States that is
likely to draw an angry response
from the North.
Under a previous 2001 accord
with Washington, South Korea
had been barred from deploying
ballistic missiles with a range of
more than 300 kilometers (186
miles) and a payload of more than
500 kilograms (1,100 pounds)
because of concerns about a
regional arms race.
The restriction has made South

Korea's missile capability inferior
to that of rival North Korea, and
some key militaryinstallations in
the North have been out of South
Korea's missile range.
South Korea announced
Sunday that the U.S. accord has
been altered to allow the South
to have ballistic missiles with
a range of up to 800 kilometers
(500 miles) to better cope with
North Korea's nuclear and missile
threats.
Under the new agreement,
South Korea will continue
to limit the payload to 500
kilograms for ballistic missiles
with an 800-kilometer range,
but it will be able to use
heavier payloads for missiles
with shorter ranges, senior
presidential official Chun Yung-
woo told a news conference. The
heavier a payload is, the more



destructive power it can have.
"The most important
objective for our government in
revising the missile guideline is
to contain North Korea's armed
provocation," Chun said.
The Defense Ministry said in

Faith Medical Clinic with her hus-

has developed to be mutually ben-
eficial.
"It really is a win-win situation
because for the students they're
going to get hands on experience
and for the people who have no
medical insurance are going to get
some of the best medical attention
in the world," Goldman said.
In addition to serving unin-
sured individuals in rural
Michigan, the clinic also offers
invaluable experience for medi-
cal students, according to Medi-.
cal School student Natalie
' Hoffmann, a student director for
the clinic.
"There's a peer education
component as well, in addition
to the student-physician com-
ponent," Hoffmann said. "The
point of having first and second
year medical students is to give
them experience with the hos-
pital process before they go into
the hospital. There was student
interest in getting more patient
contact up front before their
third year."
Medical student Moham-
ad Issa, a student director of
the clinic, said the center has

. "Let's face it. There are only
two bookstores left in town,"
he said. "It's a sad commentary
on a town like Ann Arbor ... so,
yeah, it's obligatory for us to be
involved."
Though Michigan may be
home to some of the nation's best
writers and non-profit writing
organizations, the dismal econ-
omy has given Michigan a "bad
rep" in the past few years, accord-
ing to Jeremiah Chamberlin,
associate director of the English
department's writing program.
This overshadows much of the
state's achievements in creative
writing, Chamberlin said.
Citing Detroit's shrinking
population as a major topic of
national conversation regarding
Michigan, Chamberlain said he
aims to remind people of Michi-
gan's storied literary past, and
present. To do that, the list of
speakers began earlier in the day
with writers just starting out and
1 culminated with masters of the
craft.
"You've got people at the start
of their career to people at the
peak of their career," Chamberlin
said.

undergone major changes since
the implementation of the free
primary care services. He spe-
cifically noted that the appoint-
ment-only Faith Medical Clinic
has begun to accept new unin-
sured patients since medical stu-
dents became involved, and they
have been able to decrease wait-
ing times.
Issa said that in the pilot
phase, students saw patients
every other week, at an aver-
age of about 6 to 8 patients, and
once fully launched will be able
to take up to 15 patients at a time.
All medical students working
in the clinic are there on their
own volition. Volunteer medical
students conduct an interview
with patients and take vitals
before the physician consults on
the case, and students are com-
pletely in charge of the clinic's
administration.
Issa said the experience has
served as a reminder that prac-
ticing medicine transcends sci-
ence, and is critical in fostering
human relationships.
"Speaking on a personal level,
this has been one of the most
influential things that I've been
involved in as a student," Issa
said. "We go into medicine for
the sciences, but also for the

humanitarian aspect ... This
serves to remind me and as an
opportunity to remind alot of my
classmates why we go into medi-
cine and why we do what we do."
The Student-Run Free Clinic
is looking to expand its services
beyond primary health services
for the uninsured Conjeevaram
said. He noted that the clinic
specifically hopes to integrate
women's health services, includ-
ing pap smears and mammogra-
phy, as well as colonoscopies and
dental hygiene.
"We're trying to go beyond the
just usual care we provide when
they come in, we are very much
interested in health prevention,"
Conjeevaram said. "
Administrators have also
expressed that they want the
center to become more of a long-
term primary care facility, but
Williams said he is proud of the
progress and success thus far of
an idea that was conceived just
two years ago by five medical
students.
"We hope to make a long term
presence in the Pinckney com-
munity and to put down roots
here through the student-run
free clinic," Williams said. "Then
we'll just see what spins off over
time."

to the Rose Bowl."
To avoid that loss, the rules
are different this year. The
Wolverines' offense just needs
to be smart. On Saturday, offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges let
Denard be Denard. Gone were
the wild throws downfield. They
were replaced by a heavier dose
of run and rendered moot by a
few throw aways. Gone, too, was
the constant pressure that foes
such as Notre Dame and Ala-
bama had created.
See, in this conference, offenses
don't need to be as flashy. Here
an offense that limits mistakes
and a defense that attacks can
wait for something good to hap-
pen.
On Saturday, it happened three
times.
The first gift was a ball tipped
off a Purdue receiver's hands
and into those of sophomore
cornerback Raymon Taylor.
Taylor sped 63 yards the other

way for Michigan's third score,
a touchdown so easy that it was
a something "I could've done,"
joked Michigan coach Brady
Hoke.
The second gift, again unforced
but pounced upon by an aggres-
sive Michigan defense, was on
the ensuing kickoff. Purdue
returner Akeem Hunt just
dropped the ball, and sopho-
more cornerback Delonte Hol-
lowell just scooped it up.
The drive stalled when redshirt
junior kicker Brendan Gibbons
missed a 44-yarder into the
wind. Two weeks ago, in a hos-
tile Notre Dame stadium, Gib-
bons's miss would be crippling.
But here, it was a blip. It didn't
matter. Michigan already led by
three touchdowns.
In the fourth quarter, another
interception fell from the sky
like a leftover raindrop from
last night's showers. Again, it
was a ball tipped off a receiver.
This time, redshirt junior safety
Thomas Gordon was there.
By then, the Wolverines led by
three scores with nine minutes

left, and Michigan had locked
up a victory against one of the
Big Ten's better opponents. It's
a conference as wide-open and
ordinary as ever.
On a day when Michigan State,
the Wolverines' likely chal-
lenger for the Legends' Division
title, eked out a victory over
lowly Indiana, Michigan ran off
the field fresh.
Freshman Dennis Norfleet ran
off singing to himself. Senior
defensive end Craig Roh jogged
off and laughed with a team-
mate. Athletic Director Dave
Brandon ran off with a grin,
then pointed at someone and
pumped his fist.
Afterward, howls filled the
musty air outside the Michigan
locker room. The victory yells
and off-pitch singing echoed
toward the podium where
Brady Hoke was speaking.
"There's a lot of noise back
there," the Michigan coach
said.
The victory's cries were jarring
and new and beautiful. Sounds
like Big Ten football.

Among other events, a panel
on the future of literary journal-

authors who discussed the direc-
tion journalism is headed in and
how to seek out opportunities to
further journalism.
"I enjoyed hearing about how
journalism is changing and about
their work," said LSA Junior
Michael Nevitt. "About the dif-
ferent opportunities in the field
that these authors have been able
to pursue."
Though the event lasted for its
scheduled hour, Nevitt said there
was a lot more to discuss.
"There should have been
something where prospective
journalists and people interest-
ed in the field would go to hear
information," he said. "It turned
into the writers and the authors

"I really became a writer in
many ways by hearing Charlie
Baxter read when I was 15 in

the conversation. "I had a trans-

'Wow, I want to be a writer, and

Despite the packed auditori-

said.

Decades-long
dispute has resulted
in thousands of
deaths
MANILA, Philippines (AP) -
The Philippine government and
the country's largest Muslim
rebel group have reached a
preliminary peace deal that is
a major breakthrough toward
endinga decades-longinsurgency
that killed tens of thousands and
held back development in the
south.
Philippine President Benigno
Aquino III said the "framework
agreement" calling for an
autonomous region for minority
Muslims in the predominantly
Roman Catholic nation was an
assurance the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front insurgents will
no longer aim to secede.
The agreement, announced
Sunday and to be signed Oct.15 in
Manila, spells out principles on
major issues, including the extent
of power, revenues and territory
of the Muslim region. If all goes
well, a final peace deal could be
reached by 2016, when Aquino's
six-year term ends, officials said.
"This framework agreement
paves the way for final and
enduring peace in Mindanao,"
Aquino said, referring to the
southern Philippine region
and homeland of the country's
Muslims. "This means that
the hands that once held rifles
will be put to use tilling land,
selling produce, manning work
stations and opening doorways of
opportunity."
He cautioned that "the work
does not end here" and that
details of the accord still need to
be worked out. Those talks are
expected to be tough but doable,
officials and rebels said.
Rebel vice chairman Ghadzali
Jaafar said the agreement
provides a huge relief to people
who have long suffered from
war and are "now hoping the day
would come when there will be
no need to bear arms."
The deal marks the most
significant progress in 15 years
of on-and-off negotiations with

the 11,000-strong Moro group on
ending an uprising that has left
more than 120,000 people dead,
displaced about 2 million others
and held back development in
the south. Western governments
have long worried that rebel
strongholds could become
breeding grounds for al-Qaida-
affiliated extremists.
"The parties agree that the
status quo is unacceptable,"
the 13-page agreement says. It
calls for the creation of a new
Muslim autonomous region
called "Bangsamoro" to replace
an existing one created in 1989
which Aquino characterized as
a "failed experiment," where
poverty and corruption have
forced many "to articulate their
grievances through the barrel of
agun."
The accord also calls for the
establishment of a 15-member
"Transition Commission" to
work out the details of the
preliminary agreement and draft
a law creating the new Muslim
autonomous region in about two
years.
Rebel forces would be
deactivated gradually "beyond
use," the agreement says, without
specifying a timetable.
The Philippine government
would continue to exercise
exclusive powers over defense
and security, foreign and
monetary policy in the new
autonomous region, where
Muslims would be assured of
an "equitable share of taxation,
revenues, and the fruits of
national patrimony ... and equal
protection of laws and access to
impartial justice," according to
Aquino.
Philippine officials said the
preliminary accord would be
posted on the government's
website for public scrutiny, and
would be signed in Manila in the
presence of Aquino, Malaysian
Prime Minister Najib Razak and
Moro rebel chief Al Haj Murad
Ibrahim.
"It's been a long journey and
this is an important milestone
in our search for lasting peace,"
presidential peace talks adviser
Teresita Deles told AP.
The United States, Britain,
Malaysia and other countries

welcomed the accord.
"This agreementis atestament
to the commitment of all sides
for a peaceful resolution to
the conflict in the southern
Philippines," U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton
said in a statement. "The next
steps will be to ensure that the
framework agreement is fully
implemented."
The new Muslim region would
be built upon an existing five-
province autonomous territory,
among the country's poorest and
most violent, with more than 4
million people.
The Moro rebels earlier
dropped a demand for a separate
Muslim state and renounced
terrorism.
Their negotiator, Mohagher
Iqbal,earliersaidhisgroupwould
not lay down its weapons until a
final peace accord is concluded.
He said the insurgents could
form a political party and run
in democratic elections to get a
chance atleading the autonomous
region for which they have been
fighting.
In Kuala Lumpur, Philippine
government negotiator Marvic
Leonen said both sides face the
enormous task of workingoutthe
details. "We are not naive to say
that there would be no obstacles.
But the Philippine government
will defend the agreement,"
Leonen said.
The challenges are many.
In 2008, the planned signing
of a similar preliminary pact
was scuttled when opponents
went to the Supreme Court,
which declared the agreement
unconstitutional. Fighting
erupted when three rebel
commanders attacked Christian
communities, and an ensuing
military offensive killed more
than 100 people and displaced
about 750,000 villagers before a
cease-fire ended the violence.
One of the hardline rebel
commanders, Ameril Umbra
Kato, broke off from the Moro
rebels last year and formed a
new group opposed to the talks.
Kato's forces launched attacks on
several army camps and outposts
in August, prompting another
army offensive that killed more
than So fighters in the 200-strong

remains mystery,
leaves friends
unsatisfied
MOBILE, Ala. (AP) - Class-
mates and friends are question-
ing why a police officer fatally
shot a University of South Ala-
bama freshman who was naked
and had been banging on a win-
dow at police headquarters.
Campus officials didn't give
any indication that Gil Collar,
18, of Wetumpka had a weapon
when he was shot. A university
spokesman said he was fatally
wounded about 1:30 a.m. Satur-
day after an officer heard a bang
on a window and went outside to
investigate.
A statement issued by uni-
versity spokesman Keith Ayers
said Collar, who wrestled at
Wetumpka High School before
enrolling at South Alabama,
assumed a "fighting stance" and
chased an officer before being
shot. The officer tried to retreat
numerous times to defuse the
situation before opening fire, the
school said.
But sophomore Tyler Ken-
drick said campus authorities
haven't provided any satisfying
answers about why Collar was
killed.
"Really, it just upsets me that
there's no other way to appre-
hend an unarmed student rath-
er than shooting him. I don't

understand that," Kendrick
said.
Student Joshua Frye said it
seemed the officer could have
used something other than a fire-
arm to stop Collar.
"What I feel is that a cop has
more than a gun," he said.
The officer was placed on paid
leave, and an autopsy will deter-
mine if drugs or alcohol were
involved.
Campus officials said the
confrontation was recorded by
security cameras. The video
and other information has been
turned over to the district attor-
ney and the Mobile County Sher-
iff's Office, which will review the
shooting.
Colgan Meanor went to high
school with Collar and then
enrolled at the same college.
"He was a great, loving guy
who always made people smile,"
she said. "He's not the kind of
guy that people knew him and
said he would do something like
this."
Collar was the second person
killed on the South Alabama
campus since last year.
A university freshman was
charged with murder in the fatal
stabbing of another teenager
who was slain in an on-campus
apartment in July 2011. The vic-
tim was a visitor to campus and
was not enrolled, authorities
said.
Ayers said South Alabama,
located near downtown Mobile,
was still "a very safe campus,"
despite Collar's death.

Students celebrate
Ghandi Day in A2

200 participate
in service day in
honor of renowned
leader
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Despitetemperatureshovering
in the low 40s, LSA freshman
Juhi Rattan braved the cold at
the City of Ann Arbor Natural
Area Preservation on Saturday
to pull up honeysuckle weeds,
shivering alongside fellow
volunteers.
Rattan was among 200 other
students participatingin Ghandi
Day, a service event sponsored
by the University's Indian
American Student Association
and designed to celebrate
activism. The event coincided
with the birthday of renowned
Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi.
This year, the University of
Michigan also collaborated
with Michigan State University
and Wayne State University
to celebrate Ghandi's work.
Around 8 a.m., students
gathered to watch a short
introductory video. 'Lose
Yourself" by Eminem played in

the background as organizers
invited participants to "lose
themselves in helping their
community."
Before boarding University
buses en route to nine service
sites around Ann Arbor,
participants gathered around
the Gandhi Rock, a memorial
located on the Diag outside the
Shapiro Undergraduate Library.
LSA junior Ravi Shah, an
IASA community service chair,
said the idea of dedicating a
Gandhi Rock started 15 years
ago when IASA members sought
out to further celebrate the
leader's message.
Each day, a member affixed
a plaque to a small boulder
outside the library, which
was subsequently removed at
night, since the group had not
obtained official permission for
a memorial.
The students maintained
the temporary memorial every
day until the University, moved
by their efforts, allowed a
permanent commemoration.
Shah said Gandhi Day's
roots began around the official
founding of the Gandhi Rock,
noting the memorial is an
important symbol of IASA's
dedication to the leader's
philosophies of peace and

understanding.
"It's something we're really
passionate about," Shah said.
Shah said his biggest
challenge was finding venues
that could accommodate such a
large number of volunteers. This
year, the event had its highest
number of registrations yet, and
participants came from a diverse
array of campus groups.
"People are willing to wake
up so early, it shows people want
to help their community," Shah
said.
While checking in on the
multitude of sites, Shah said he
noticed that students not only
enjoyed their projects, but also
appreciated the opportunity to
bond with their fellow group
members.
Working alongside a nature
trail, Rattan and her team
dragged throngs of invasive
species into piles at the City
of Ann Arbor Natural Area
Preservation. Often, her work
crossed paths with hikers and
she apologized for blocking
their way, but she noted many
took a moment to thank the
students for their work.
"Not a single person was
warm, but it was worth it
because it was for a greater

Samuel Zell, the founder and Chairman of Equity Group Investments, speaks at the Michigan Union on Friday.

From Page 1A
him one of the wealthiest men
in the world. Known as one of the
pioneers of private equity invest-
ments, Zell began his career in
real estate - even dabbling in it as
a student at the University - and
has since diversified his invest-
ments to include interests in
media, sports and energy.
Zell is chairman of seven com-
panies, including the Tribune
Company, which owns The Chi-
cago Tribune, The Los Angeles
Times and 23 television stations
nationwide.
When discussing the Euro-
zone crisis, Zell said the countries
were foolish in joining a system
without determining a means of
leaving.
"They created a system with-
out an exit strategy," Zell said.
"You guys are in the PE business.
What's the first rule you learn?
Don't cut a deal unless you know
the exit strategy."
Zell also noted that the Bud-
get Control Act of 2011 - which
will take effect Jan. 1, 2013 - will
serve as an impending fiscal cliff.
The policy, a series of drastic
automatic cuts to federal spend-
ing and benefits coupled with
tax increases, is the result of the
failure of Congress and President
Barack Obama to reach a compro-
mise to reduce the federal deficit.
If there is no action to pre-
vent the fiscal decline, many
economists project that the U.S.
economy would enter another
recession.
"Grab your ass and hang on,
because we don't know what's
going to happen," Zell said.
"There's some people who sug-
gest that maybe nothing could be
better for our country than to get
some horrific incident medicines,
and that might change the whole
world... Obviously, most people
are deathly afraid of it."
Compared to other recessions,
Zell said the current economic
downturn is far more severe than
what he has experienced in the

past. He added that his company
is currently in the "9-11 business,"
meaning that distressed com-
panies call Zell's firm, request a
buyout, and hear back within two
weeks.
"In 1999, I was 98 percent lev-
eraged and I was a multi-billion-
aire," Zell said. "In '91 and '92 I
was a billionaire (but) I couldn't
make payroll or I was worry-
ing about making payroll. But it
was all within the scale of what
you could do, and the uncertain-
ties were a great deal less and the
ports in the storm seemed more
obvious."
Zell is also a vocal public sup-
porter of Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney. Since the
beginning of 2011, Zell has donat-
ed at least $378,500 to political
action committees, candidates
from both parties and the Repub-
lican National Committee. His
single largest contribution was
$100,000 to American Cross-
roads, a PAC co-founded by Karl
Rove, a former adviser to former
president George W. Bush.
Since December 2011, Zell
has also contributed $180,000
to Restore our Future, a politi-
cal action committee supporting
Romney. According to the Chris-
tian Science Monitor, Restore our
Future has raised $96.7 million
to date, and The New York Times
reported in May that nearly half
of the February total of $60 mil-
lion stemmed from donors con-
nected to Wall Street.
Although Zell did not overtly
state his political preference dur-
ing his remarks to the conference
attendees, he later expressed his
views to a group of investors as he
was leaving.
"It seems to me no matter who
is elected, 2013 is going to suck,"
Zell said during his remarks.
"There's no way, whether it's
Romney or it's Obama, that 2013
is going to be a pleasant environ-
ment."
During his discussion with
the investors, Zell also criticized
Obama's performance in last

week's presidential debate.
"Take away his teleprompter -
he can't talk," Zell said. "He went
toe to toe with Romney on num-
bers. Barack can't add."
David Brophy, the director of
the Office for the Study of Private
Equity Finance at the Ross School
of Business, said Zell's involve-
ment at the University and his
role in founding the Samuel Zell
and Robert H. Lurie Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies has been
critical in aiding student efforts.
"One could argue he's the most
important contributor to every-
thing entrepreneurial here on
campus," Brophy said. "Without
them, the seed capital, you might
say for this, wasn't there."
Brophy added he wasn't sur-
prised to hear Zell speak about
political issues given how out-
spoken the billionaire has been in
the past about issues affecting the
global economy.
Edward Hightower - the
managing director of Motoring
Ventures LLC, an automotive-
focused private equity firm - said
conferences like these are impor-
tant to see how other private
equity companies are handling a
rough economy.
"What's most valuable is you
get to know what another investor
is looking for, and you get to share
what you're looking for," Hight-
ower said.
Despite the economic difficul-
ties, Hightower said the private
equity business remained a prom-
ising field for interested students,
but agreed with Zell's assessment
that adaptability was crucial in
the current market.
"Economies go in cycles, and
what (the current state of the
economy) really does is put the
onus on private equity firms
to create value through really
improving the operations and
improving the health and success
of the business over the longterm,
rather than just financial gains in
the hopes that the business will
be better after a few years," High-
tower said.

UMHS online portal
aids information sharing

Program sends
records to doctors,
patients on secure
server
By ROBBIE AUSTEN
For the Daily
In order to more easily
share medical information, the
University of Michigan Health
System and University Health
Service launched a shared
online portal and mobile app
this fall that will share health
records, allowing patients to
easily connect to their doctor's
office online.
On the website,
MyUofMHealth.org, users
can request appointments,
place prescription renewals,
review health history and test
results, view immunization
records and send secure
messages to their health team.
The server is more secure
than previous communication
methods, like e-mail, in order
to ensure privacy for all medical
information.
Proxy accounts are also
available so users can request

access to view their child's
health information and can
grant access to others to view
their health information.
In the situation of a sensitive
lab test, such as a cancer biopsy,
the test results will not be
available for two weeks until
the doctor signs off and the
patient has been notified, so as
to prevent them from receiving
information online first.
According to the online
patient portal, more than 17,000
people have signed up for the
program, which officially
launched on Aug. 15. In order to
register, an activation code must
be assigned by a clinician or
the online request form, which
enables a user to create a secure
username and password.
UHSdirectorRobertWinfield
said he believes the portal is
revolutionary for the health
system, noting that with the test
results and doctor summaries
online, the portal will also help
to prevent miscommunication.
"It's exciting, making
patients better partners and
improving quality care,"
Winfield said. "For example, if
you go to UHS, the emergency
room can see all the results. If
you go to a specialist, they can

see all of your UHS results. This
portal provides a tremendous
amount of interconnectedness
and patient background
information."
Robert Ernst, the medical
director of UHS, said the patient
portal will be especially useful
for students that enjoy using
technology.
"It's terrific, and the most
efficient way to communicate
test results to students," Ernst
said. "I am sure that the tech-
savvy students. of U-M will
rapidlylaunchintothe program."
LSA freshman Alyssa
Deronda said she plans to use
the new system to prevent
unnecessary trips to the
doctor's office.
"I definitely plan on using it,"
Deronda said. "It's a lot more
convenient, and I have to make
less trips down here from North
Campus."
However, LSA junior Ivan
Miller said he believes the
nature of his visits won't
warrant portal usage.
"Since I just get allergy shots
at UHS, I don't plan on using the
online health portal too much,"
Miller said. "But I will use the
portal if I need to reschedule
appointments."

Before long, the town is overrun

All of the characters Burton
has created in this film are dis-
tinct and memorable, but perhaps
the funniest and creepiest one is
Edgar (Atticus Shaffer, TV's "The
Middle"), an Igor-like hunchback
who eventually becomes Victor's
"friend" and accomplice. Voiced

lence, Edgar's presence on screen
is likely to scare younger audi-
ence members, but that subtle
scariness, coupled with a strange
sense of likability, is a demonstra-
tion of Burton's ability to flesh out
interesting characters.
Apart from the collection of
surprisingly complex characters,
"Frankenweenie" is also memo-
rable for its distinct approach to
claymation. Unlike previous films
that have adopted the same tech-
nique, "Frankenweenie" is shot
in black and white with 3D. It
seems like a strange combination,
but works perfectly with Burton's
take on the innate creepiness of
everything around us. The bleak
Victorian houses and crooked
trees in the form of skeletal
hands grasping for life are just
a few examples of how well the
approach works. Ultimately, it's
this visual brilliance that make
this movie an otherworldly expe-
rience.

Saturday, a horrid performance son.

It amounted to a plus-three
day for the Wolverines in turn-
over margin against the Boiler-
makers, a big factor in helping
Michigan to an easy win in its
Big Ten opener.
For the defense, it was espe-
cially sweet. The unit performed
exceedingly well last season in
the turnover column, but that
hadn't shown up so far this sea-
son - better late than never.
"Very encouraging," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.

"That's got to be a big part of
how you win. Again, talking
about playing on the road, that's
taking care of the ball offensive-
ly, which we did a pretty good
job ... for the most part."
The Wolverines entered Sat-
urday's tilt with a minus-seven
mark in turnover margin, a
polar opposite of the plus-seven
figure that they totaled for the
season a year ago. And Michi-
gan was coming off its worst
performance in that area in its

last game - the team turned the
ball over six times en route to a
minus-four day against Notre
Dame two weeks ago.
On Saturday, senior quarter-

WEST LAFAYETTE - The
nondescript black lettering is
only slightly visible against
the camouflage canvas of

the Michigan football team's
undershirt: Team 133, Road
Warrior.
Until their visit to Purdue on
Saturday, the Wolverines had
been anything but road war-
riors. Since Michigan coach
Brady Hoke arrived in Ann
Arbor, Michigan has posted an
unbeaten 11-0 record at home.
Away from Michigan Stadium,
though, the Wolverines were
3-4.
With the goal of winning the
Big Ten title on the line every

weekend and four road games
on the conference slate, some-
thing needed to change.
"If we lose Saturday, then we
might not go" to the Rose Bowl,
said fifth-year senior lineback-
er Kenny Demens. "It's do or
die, basically."
There are no days off. The
Michigan defense took matters
into its own hands in a 44-13
victory against Purdue, hold-
ing the Boilermaker offense to
just 213 total yards.

straddle that
line.
The tapestry is built for Big
Ten football, stitched together
for blue-collar men and a blue-
collar game. The conference has
historically been big, brawny
and bruising.
But this fall, the Big Ten foot-
ball programs have failed again
and again on the national stage.
Respect in college football isn't
just given, it's earned. Right
now, the Big Ten deserves none.
On Sunday, the USA Today
coaches poll was released and,

for the first time in its history,
no Big Ten teams were ranked
among the top-25 teams in the
nation. (Ohio State is undefeated
but ineligible for ranking while
serving punishments for the
program's 2011 sanctions.)
During the non-conference
slate this fall, the 12 Big Ten
teams posted a combined 34-13
record. Those losses can't be
chalked up to strength of sched-
ule, either. Just five of those
losses were to ranked teams,
and only one win was over a
team in the top-25.
The powerhouse programs
plummeted early.
Ohio State and Penn State
entered the season crippled by
sanctions. Neither is in conten-
tion for a bowl appearance, a
national ranking or a stab at the
Big Ten championship.
Wisconsin began the year
ranked No. 12 before a tumultu-
ous three-week stretch against
consecutive unranked oppo-
nents - a five-point win over
Northern Iowa, a three-point
loss to Oregon State and a two-
point win over Utah State.
Michigan lost to No. 2 Ala-
bama in the season opener,
barely escaping with its dignity
in a nationally televised blow-
out.
Michigan State snuck by No.

24 Boise State in week one and
climbed the polls. Then the
Spartans lost to No. 20 Notre
Dame, who then beat Michigan
the following week.
The Leaders Division has
become a two-horse race
between Purdue and Wisconsin.
And neither team is a thorough-
bred.
The Legends Division crown
is expected to go to Michigan,
Michigan State or Nebraska at
season's end. All three teams
have two losses on their sched-
ule, with the Spartans and
Cornhuskers already losing a
Big Ten game.
Now nobody can crack the
nation's top 25. C'mon, even
teams you barely recognize
made the top 25. Iowa State?
Louisiana Tech? Cincinnati?
The Big Ten can't stand up
to the rest of the nation. It's
become a bit of an embarrass-
ment for a once-proud confer-
ence. And it's nothing new.
The discussion rises up every
winter when bowl games come
and go: How does the Big Ten
stack up with the SEC, the ACC,
the Pac-12? The truth is that it
doesn't. Not right now.
It's not only the teams that
haven't kept pace in college
football this fall, it's the Big
Ten's headlining players too.

Michigan senior quarterback
Denard Robinson, Wisconsin
running back Montee Ball,
Michigan State running back
Le'Veon Bell and Nebraska
running back Rex Burkhead all
entered the season with Heis-
man hype.
Bell, averaging 129 rushing
yards per game, is the only one
putting up the numbers expect-
ed of him, but he's nowhere near
the Heisman frontrunners after
six weeks.
The Big Ten just doesn't make
a lot of sense.
That brings us back to West
Lafayette and Michigan-Pur-
due, a game in which the Wol-
verines rolled to a 44-13 victory
in front of a crowd of less than
50,000 scattered throughout the
Ross-Ade Stadium horseshoe. It
really was never close.
The scary part is that Purdue
has a legitimate shot at a Big
Ten division crown - ESPN
analyst Kirk Herbstreit even
called Purdue a Big Ten favorite
prior to the game. The blue-
collar conference is one marred
by futility. And national respect
isn't easy to get.
It's the big life, big stage, big
problems.

in 1-1 draw vs. PSU posts shutout in visit to Evanston

By DAN HARTLEP
For the Daily
After stunning Ohio State last
week with ashot from midfield by
freshman midfielder Jack Brown
early in the second overtime,
the Michigan men's soccer team
looked to keep the momentum
rolling on Saturday against Penn
State. PENN STATE 1
The MICHIGAN 1
Wolverines
raced out to an early lead, but
failed to keep Penn State from
scoring as the teams fought to a
1-1 draw.
The Wolverines (1-1-1 Big Ten,
3-5-1 overall) had the upper hand
offensively in the early minutes of
the match, scoring in the fourth
minute off the head of junior for-
ward T.J. Roehn. After a strong
cross into the goal boxby redshirt
freshman midfielder Colin McA-
tee to a streaking Roehn, the ball
slid underneath the left arm of
the Nittany Lion goalkeeper for
Roehn's second goal of the year.
"Colin McAtee had a great
game," Roehn said. "He sent in a
great low ball and I got my head
on it and beat the (keeper) near
post."
From that point on, it was all
Penn State.
The Nittany Lions (1-1-1, 6-3-
2) threw everything they had at
redshirt sophomore goalkeeper
Adam Grinwis, who had a career-
high 13 saves. Grinwis and the
Wolverines'backline consistently
kept the Penn State out of the net
with the help of the hard-nosed
play of junior defender Ezekiel
Harris. Harris made several key
defensive stops when the Wol-
verines needed them most, as the

Nittany Lions continued to bring
pressure.
By the end of the match, Penn
State had recorded 26 shots. First-
year Michigan coach ChakaDaley
praised the play of his keeper, but
recognized that having a career
day from a goalie is often times a
sign of defensive turmoil.
Lineup changes stemming
from injuries and suspensions
have prevented the Wolverines'
defensive four from becoming
familiar with each other this sea-
son.
The number of scoring chanc-
es that the Wolverines allowed
would come back to haunt them
in the 82nd minute. The Nit-
tany Lions found an equalizer
from defender Akil Howard, who
tapped in a low line drive from
the right edge of the goal box.
After two overtime periods of
evenly matched play and equal
scoring opportunities, the two
squads settled for a draw.
Looking to get the season back
on track, Roehn had only positive
things to say after the game.
"Getting an early goal in a
game like this was crucial," he
said. "We would have liked to get
the win, but we'll take the point."
The result ties Michigan with
Penn State for third place in the
Big Ten. The Wolverines next
take the pitch Wednesday against
undefeated Oakland University at
the U-M Soccer Complex.
Daley said he knows what his
team needs in order to be ready
for the Grizzlies.
"From here on out, there isn't
much training," Daley said. "It's
pretty much just about resting
and getting yourself ready emo-
tionally for the next big game."

The N'WESTERN 0
Wildcats'
defense could do little to slow
down an overpowering Michigan
attack. The Wolverines (5-0-1 Big
Ten, 11-2-1 overall) controlled
possession from the opening
whistle, generating a barrage of
offensive opportunities. Despite
being outshot 8-1 in the first fif-
teen minutes, Northwestern
goalkeeper Rachel Bergman held
strong and kept Michigan off the
scoreboard.
The Wolverines finally capital-
ized 17 minutes into the contest.
Junior midfielder Tori McCombs
headed a ball toward net that
was misplayed by a defender, and
Ezurike took advantage of the
mistake. Alone against the goal-
keeper, the forward lifted a shot
over Bergman and into the back
of the net, breaking the scoreless
draw. A humble Ezurike refused
to take credit for the tally.
"It's totally agroup effort," she
said. "I wouldn't get those goals
without the team."
The goal seemed to awaken
Northwestern (0-6, 4-8-2) which
began creating its own scoring
chances. Junior forward Kate
Allen, the Wildcats' greatest
offensive threat, fired a strong
shot on goal in the 27th minute,

Junior forward Nkem Ezurike scored twice against Northwestern to give the Wolverines a 2-0 Big Ten victory.

effort. That attempt was North-
western's last on target, but
Michigan's offense wasn't done
-the McCombs-to-Ezurike com-
bination soon struck again for
Michigan.
Just six minutes into the sec-
ond half, McCombs curled a low
cross into the 18-yard box. The
ball landed perfectly at the feet
of Ezurike, who had made a long
run from midfield. The forward
poked a shot past Bergman for
her eighth tally in six games.
Ezurike said she understood
the importance of the 2-0 lead,
since itvirtuallyassured a Michi-
gan victory.
"We have to win every game
from here on out," she said. "Each

game we play is like a Big Ten
championship to us."
The result temporarily pushed
Michigan into first place in the
Big Ten. Conference-leading and
4th-ranked Penn State (5-0, 11-2)
had the night off, and will face
Indiana on Sunday afternoon. If
the Nittany Lions win, they will
regain sole possession of first
place; a tie would put them even
with the Wolverines.
Once Michigan took a two-
goal lead, the defense did the
rest, holding an opponent score-
less for the tenth time this sea-
son. The back four surrendered
eight shots, but just two threat-
ened Kopmeyer. The Wolverines'
fifth clean sheet in six confer-

ence games dropped their goals-
against average to 0.36.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
has been impressed with his
defense all season long, and Sat-
urday night was no different.
"The back four were great,"
Ryan said. "There were very
few chances (for Northwestern)
throughout the game."
The victory in Evanston
helped the Wolverines match a
program record with four con-
secutive road wins. But facing a
quick turnaround before a crucial
midweek game against Michigan
State, Ryan has moved on.
"Tonight's win was nice," he
said. "I'm already focusing on
Michigan State."

On the other side of the ball,
the Michigan defense played
remarkably, shutting down Pur-
due's offense from start to finish.
Following Toussaint's second
score at the beginning of the sec-
ond quarter, sophomore corner-
back Raymon Taylor picked off
Purdue quarterback Caleb Ter-
Bush on a pass that was tipped
by the receiver, and he returned
it 63 yards down the sideline for
the score. It was the defense's
first touchdown of the season and
Taylor's second interception in as
many games.
"He ran a curl," Taylor said.
"He missed it - itwas high, and it
just fell in my hand. I saw it, I took
off with it."
Added Hoke: "I know one thing
about Raymon: Raymon's aggres-
sive. And I'd rather have guys
who are aggressive, and they're
going to run the hitches and the
rockets and the screens and that
kind of thing ... Obviously he did
a nice job with the ball. He didn't
have to make anybody miss - he
just ran up the sideline, which I
could've done."

locked out NHL players - on
each team. Most notable was the
presence of Columbus Blue Jack-
ets defenseman Jack Johnson on
the Blue team.
Along with Johnson, former
Capitals forward Mike Knuble
made an appearance, and was
able to tally a goal for the White
Team. They were joined by Colo-
rado Avalanche defenseman Matt
Hunwick, New York Islanders
forward Andy Hilbert and alum-
nus Matt Rust.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said playing with the the profes-
sional players was a good oppor-
tunity for the Wolverines to see
what it takes to play in the NHL.
Guptill agreed with Berenson
concerning the former Wolverine
players.
"It's pretty cool," he said. "You

The Boilermakers' only touch-
down of the first half came after
a Michigan fumble on a botched
handoff. Robinson attempted to
hand the ball to senior running
back Vincent Smith in the back-
field when Purdue defensive end
Robert Maci broke through the
line and blew up the play. The
Boilermakers took over posses-
sion in Michigan territory with
just under two minutes left in the
half, and TerBush led his team to
the end zone with just10 seconds
left. Even with the hiccup, the
Wolverines entered the locker
room at the half with a command-
ing 28-10 lead.
About midway through the
third quarter, following a Purdue
punt, Robinson broke the pocket
on a first down and rushed 46
yards down into the Boilermak-
er red zone. The play led to an
easy field goal for redshirt junior
placekicker Brendan Gibbons,
who redeemed himself after
missing a 44-yarder off the cross-
bar in the second quarter.
Following a Purdue field goal

line for 59 yards - his longest

Besides the opportunity to
skate with professionals, the
intrasquad competition also
allowed the new freshmen to get
some ice time with the rest of the
team in a game setting. Though
they only played two periods and
the officiating was less strict than
in a regulation game, Berenson
was able to mix up the lines.
"I thought (the freshmen) all
held their own," Berenson said.
"None of them were out of place.
On the flipside, I thought they all
had glimpses of why we recruited
them."
The most notable debuts were
that of the two freshmen in goal

offense settled for a field goal
again, as Gibbons booted one
through to give Michigan a 34-13
lead.
On the following Boilermaker
drive, Purdue quarterback Rob-
ert Marve was under center in
place of a struggling TerBush, and
threw an interception on a pass
tipped by the receiver, this time
to redshirt junior safety Thomas
Gordon. Gibbons was called on
yet again, chipping one through
the uprights from 28 yards.
And to put an exclamation
point on the afternoon, sopho-
more running back Thomas
Rawls scored a touchdown with
just over two minutes left in the
game on a 7-yard scamper to add
to the Michigan lead.
Following the Big Ten-opening
victory, the players spoke confi-
dently and consistently restated
their objective of winning the Big
Ten Championship.
"We want to go to the Rose
Bowl," said fifth-year senior
Kenny Demens. "(Hoke) treats
every game in the Big Ten like it's
the Big Ten Championship. And
we understand it, he understands
it and he puts a lot of emphasis on
it."
Hunwick graduated last year, he
left a gaping hole at goaltender,
which is still a question mark
for Michigan. Sunday was also
the first appearance of highly
touted freshman defenseman
Jacob Trouba in a Michigan uni-
form. He didn't have any standout
plays, but he notched a solid first
performance, holding his own
against some of the upperclass-
men and the professionals.
"(Trouba) got me with a nice
elbow in the side of the head
in the first shift, so I was really
