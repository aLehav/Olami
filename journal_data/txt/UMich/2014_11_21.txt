Carrying signs and shouting
"Open it up, or shut it down,"
about two dozen members of the
organization By Any Means Nec-
essary shut down the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents monthly
meeting Thursday afternoon.

The protesters pushed past
barriers intended to separate the
public from the table of regents
and University's executive offi-
cers inside the Union's Anderson
Room. They refused to be seated
after interrupting remarks by
recently inaugurated Ann Arbor
Mayor Christopher Taylor just a
few minutes into the meeting.
"The University of Michigan
can no longer ignore the growing
segregation and intense hostil-
ity towards minority and'women
students unless they want a rude
awakening on this campus,"
BAMN organizer Jose Alvarenga
said during the protest. "Actions

speak louder than words."
Several security officers
struggled to hold protesters
behind the ropes. Both plain-
clothed and uniformed officers
stood with their arms stretched
out, at times pressing against the
small crowd to keep them from
approaching the boardroom
table. After a few minutes of pro-
test, University President Mark
Schlissel asked if the students
would step back from the rope,
but apart from those comments,
the University did not directly
ask the protesters to sit down or
stop chanting.
After staying for a few min-

utes of the protest, the regents
and executive officers left the
room at the recommendation of
public safety officers. Accord-
ing to DPSS spokesperson Diane
Brown, additional officers were
dispatched to the Union but
made no arrests or ejections.
BAMN - a national organiza-
tion that advocates on behalf of
affirmative action and inimigra-
tion rights, among other issues -
held a press conference near the
entrance of the Union before the
meeting and rallied on campus
earlier this month, listing several
demands directed toward the

BAMN demands
increase in minority
enrollment
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
After the chants of about two
dozen BAMN protesters forced
University President Mark
Schlissel to relocate Thursday's
meeting of the University's Board
of Regents, several BAMN mem-
bers called on the University to
increase its minority enrollment
by guaranteeing admission to
every in-state student in the top
10 percent of their high school
graduating class.
Despite the adoption of simi-
lar plans in Texas, California
and Florida, it's unclear whether
such a policy would be feasible in
Michigan.
In recent years, the Univer-
sity has struggled to increase the
representation of minority stu-
dents, particularly since the pas-
sage of Proposal 2 in 2006, which

banned the consideration of race
in admissions.
The number of underrepre-
sented minority students in this
year's freshman class remained
roughly stagnant, though the
proportion of minority students
reflected a slight decrease due to
the largerthan average class size.
Along with a list of several
other grievances, BAMN has
demanded that the University
double its minority enrollment
through an initiative similaruto
Texas' "Top 10 Percent Rule." In
Texas, every public university
automatically admits students
who rank in the top 10 percent of
their high school classes.
LSA senior Tara McManus, a
BAMN member who attended
the protest, said the University
uses the statewide ban on affir-
mative action as a cover for its
failure to improve its enrollment
of minority students. She said
adopting a plan similar to the
policy in Texas would increase
minority enrollment while stay-
ing within the lines of the state's

Two months after 43 stu-
dents went missing after being
taken from Iguala, Mexico by
police during a protest, Uni-
versity students commemo-
rated the missing students'
lives during a vigil on the Diag

Thursday evening.,.
Around 5 p.m., a group of
students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents marched from Mason
Hall to the Diag, carry-
ing posters with the phrase
"Vivos los Queremos," rough-
ly translating to "bring them
back alive," and a string of
images depicting the faces and
names of the missing students.
They chanted: "Where are the
43 students? Where?"
On Sept. 26, 43 students
from Raul Isidro Burgo Ayo-
tzinapa Normal School were
protesting for education
reform in Iguala when police

officers shot, at the students
and then rounded them up
into police vehicles. They have
not been seen since.
Mexican government offi-
cials have since stated that the
students were killed by a car-
tel, however their bodies have
not been accounted for.
The protest and vigil comes
on the eve of a global day
of action, which is slated to
include more than 250 pro-
tests across the world. On

people created a large circle

University's administration.
Most prominently, BAMN has
criticized the University for fail-
ing to increase minority enroll-
ment. According to the Office of
the Registrar, the University's
population of underrepresent-
ed minority students remained
roughly stagnant over the past
year, totaling just above 10 per-
cent.
After about an hour, Schlissel
reconvened the meeting inside
the Regents Room in the Flem-
ing Administration Building,
noting the meeting had been
adjourned for "public safety
reasons" and a transcript of the
reconvened portion would be
posted online.
"I certainly respect the right
of the group to speak up and tell
us their opinion about some-
thing important," Schlissel said
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily after the meeting. "I'm
disappointed that they chose to
disrupt the meeting, but we were
able to conduct the business of the
University in this separate venue
as needed."
The meeting in Fleming last-
ed about 10 minutes. The board
quickly voted to approve the
renovation projects listed on the
November agenda, including

the truth is also obscured for
political reasons.

facturer Phillip Morris filed a

M. Dennison Building and the
new Biological Science Building.
Though staff members of the
University's Office of Public
Affairs alerted the media to the
venue change and noted a tran-
script of the meeting would be
made available to the public, a
general announcement regarding
the venue change was not made
inside the Anderson Room.
The University maintains that
relocating the meeting did not
violate Michigan's Open Meet-
ings Act, which specifies that
decisions of public bodies - like
the University's Board of Regents
- must be made at a meeting open
to the public.
Across Regents Plaza, signs
on the Administration Build-
ing doors read, "The building is
LOCKED." Security officials ini-
tially declined entry to Michigan
Daily reporters until a regent told
the officers to permit entry.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed that only
news media were allowed into the
meeting.
Apart from the regents and
executive officers, the only mem-
bers of the public present inside
the Regents Room were members
of the media, Central Student
Government President Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy senior, and
public affairs staff.
Though the Open Meetings Act
says meetings must be held "in a
place available to the public," it is
$10 billion lawsuit against ABC
alleging its "Day One" special
report was libelous. The series -
which also included another law-
suit, which resulted in the same
settlement - reported that the
companies used extra nicotine in
their cigarette products to keep
people smoking.
Lewis said ABC not only opted
to apologize for the report, but

likely the University could have
legally excluded the protesters
from entering the new meeting
location. The law states, "A per-
son shall not be excluded from a
meeting otherwise open to the
public except for a breach of the
peace actually committed at the
meeting."
After the regents had left the
Anderson Room, BAMN group
members shouted their demands
to a half empty room for more
than an hour. The group later
marched toward the Student
Activities Building, which
houses the University's Office
of Undergraduate Admissions,
and continued chanting as they
moved up and down streets near
the Union.
BAMN has called on the Uni-
versity to adopt a "10 percent
plan," similar to a policy in Texas,
where the top 10 percent of every
in-state high school graduating
class is guaranteed admission to
any of the state's public institu-
tions.
In addition to increasing
minority enrollment, BAMN
has demanded the University
improve transparency related to
sexual assault allegations.
"We don't want to wait another
year to see the results of another
failure of another committee,
another failure of another lan-
guage campaign, and see those
numbers of minority enroll-
ment drop again like they have
also retracted another documen-
tary on U.S. tobacco exports to
other countries.
"People in ABC were told to kill
a half-million dollar documentary
about how U.S. has been exporting
tobacco outside the U.S. In the name
of free trade, tobacco was allowed
be grown, sold, manufactured and
advertised to children and others
around the world," he said.

been doing over the last five to 10
years," Alvarenga said at a press
conference before the meeting.
He said the efforts the Univer-
sity has made in response to their
other requests have been inad-
equate.
"The University's solutions for
this year are the same solutions
the administration has been giv-
ing for years and years at this Uni-
versity," he said. "They have just
created more campaigns about
inclusion but in reality they don't
address the real problem, which
is that drop of minority enroll-
ment."
In an interview after the meet-
ing, E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, said the
board was trying to listen, but
BAMN made it difficult.
"I was disappointed," she said.
"They are talking about issues
that are important to us, but in a
way that makes it hard for them
to be heard. I'm not going to
hear you if I'm scared that you
are going to hurt me. I'm just not
going to hear it. That is the down-
side of the strategy."
BAMN has not requested a
meeting with administrators,
Harper said.
"If you want to sit down and
talk about the issue we can cre-
ate an environment to do that to,"
Harper said. "This isn't a situa-
tion where people have asked for
a conversation and they have been
refused.
However, Lewis did not entire-
ly place blame on institutions for
delayed awareness of tobacco's
harmful effects on health. He said
public apathy is also responsible,
and he is concerned that the pub-
lic is not as media-literate as it has
been in the past.
"News consumption and paid

ban on affirmative action.
"I believe the 10 percent plan
works because to say that these
students, the top 10 percent of
students at these schools, aren't
intelligent enough or aren't
equipped enough to come here is
just a complete joke," she said.
However, University President

Mark Schlissel said the Univer-
sity would not be likely to imple-
ment admissions strategies like a
percentage-based plan, arguing
they are ineffective in an Octo-
ber interview with The Michigan
Daily.
"I'm not sure that's necessar-
ily the answer, or at least there's
not strong evidence that that's the
answer in the context of our laws
here in the state," he said.
The 10 percent rule was origi-

H,.-,m

nally conceived to increase diver-
sity on campuses after the Fifth
Circuit Court outlawed other
affirmative action policies in
Texas during the 1996 court case
Hopwood v. Texas. Hopwood
was eventually invalidated by the
2003 U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sion in Grutter v. Bollinger, which
upheld the use of affirmative
action for a narrow interest like
ensuring diversity.
In 2009, the state legislature
modified the law to allow only
the University of Texas at Aus-
tin to cap admissions from the 10
percent plan when the numbers
made up more than 75 percent of
reserved spots for in-state stu-
dents. The other 25 percent of
enrolled students are admitted
through a race-conscious, holis-
tic review process.
In the 2013 case Fisher v.
University of Texas at Austin,
the Fifth Circuit Court, after
having the case remanded back
from the U.S. Supreme Court,
decided that the university's use
of the "holistic," race-conscious
admissions process for the 25
percent of reserved spots was
valid in addition to the effects of
the 10 percent plan.
Gary Susswein, director of
University Media Relations at
the University of Texas at Aus-
tin, said the original version of
the law limited the university's
ability to have any discretion
over the admissions process
because automatically admit-
ted in-state students were filling
almost the entire cohort of each
entering freshman class. The
4

modification went into effect in
2011.
California and Florida have
also implemented top 9 percent
and top 20 percent plans, respec-
tively, after those states banned
affirmative action.
Shortly before the Supreme
Court ruled in Grutter v. Bol-
linger and Gratz v. Bollinger, both
in 2003, the University issued a
release responding to percent-
based plans enacted in Texas,
California and Florida.
The statement argued that the
plans failed to evaluate students
holistically, encouraged racially
segregated high schools, discour-
aged students from attending
competitive schools and disad-
vantages universities with large
out-of-state populations.
The release also notes that
adopting the plan would require a
statewide university system, like
the University of Texas or Univer-
sity of California system, which
does not exist in Michigan. In
Michigan, admittance to one pub-
licly funded university does not
guarantee admittance to another.
According to University of
Texas at Austin enrollment data,
the policy has yielded mixed
results.
In the last two decades, the
school has practiced several dif-
ferent admissions policies. In
1996, the university's admis-
sions office practiced affirmative
action. That year, Black and His-
panic freshman enrollment was
4 percent and 15 percent, respec-
tively.
By 1998, the Hopwood decision

barred the university from con-
sidering race in admissions. After
the legislature enacted HB 588,
Black and Hispanic enrollment
hovered between 3 to 4 percent
and 14 to 16percent, respectively.
In 2004, with affirmative
action upheld in the Grutter deci-
sion, Black freshman enrollment
jumped slightly to 5 percent and
Hispanic freshmen enrollment
reached 16 percent.
Though minority enrollment
numbers have increased slightly
at the University of Texas at Aus-
tin, this jump has been partly due
to the reinstatement of affirma-
tive action, which is currently
banned in Michigan.
In California and Florida,
states with similai- percentage-
based plans, the results have also
been mixed.
Susswein, the director of
media relations at the University
of Texas at Austin, said automati-
cally admitting the top 10 per-
cent of in-state applicants allows
hardworking students to attend a
top state college or university. He
noted the policy has resulted in
improved attendance from rural
parts of the state, historically
underserved by the school.
In addition to the policy, the
school uses a holistic review pro-
cess, provides financial assistance
for first-generation college stu-
dents and employs academic pro-
grams in underperforming high
schools within the state.
Though Susswein declined to
comment on the efficacy of the
percent plan - citing ongoing
litigation in Fisher v. Texas - the

university's legal brief in the case
argues for the necessity of race-
conscious admissions, noting that
just relying on the 10 percent plan
is not an effective method for
achieving full racial diversity. 14
The brief, which argues for the
need to maintain an affirmative
action policy in the absence of
race-neutral alternatives, states
that the 10 percent plan failed to
significantly increase underrep-
resented minority enrollment.
The brief also states the policy
made it more difficult for under-
represented minority students to
gain admission under the normal
holistic review admission pro-
cess.
Law School Prof. Mark Rosen-
baum, a visiting law professor
at the University of California,
Irvine and chief counsel with the
American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California, said per-
cent plans in California had "no
impact" on improving diversity
at the state's most elite "flagship,"
like the Berkeley and Los Angeles
campuses.
"In a state as segregated as
Michigan and with Michigan at
the bottom of the nation when it
comes to resourcing K-12 public
schools, particularly those in high
poverty communities, a percent
plan is unlikely to achieve much
(of) anything in the way of diver-
sity, and runs the risk of diverting
focus from measures that might
have some impact," he wrote in an
e-mail interview.
Instead, he said he would

ers .discussed the situation,
speaking in English and Spanish.
Jorge Najera Godinez, a math
student from Guerrero - the
state where the students disap-
peared - came to Ann Arbor in
the fall to complete his master's
degree at the School of Educa-
tion. He said he was shocked and
saddened to hear that his friends
and fellow students from the
region were abducted and likely
killed.
"It was just really hard to con-
centrate on my studies so that's
why I went to ask for help and
they helped organize it," Godi-
nez said in an interview before
the vigil: "It's important that
everybody knows what's hap-
pening in the city - especially
my town - because this is not
the first time that something like
this has happened. Right now
there are 43 students but before
that there were many."
Godinez said the abducted
students traveled to Iguala, an
hour and a half away from their
hometown, to raise money for
the schools. He said every few
years a few students go missing,
and it is often blamed on the car-
tels.
Without support from the gov-
ernment, receiving an education
is a challenge for many people in
the region where these students
were from, Godinez said. He
explained how many students
live on mountains, sometimes
hours away from the closest
school, and have to walk there in
extremely hot conditions.

zations before polls opened.
"It's (the constitution and
bylaws) been around for a couple
of decades and still has the same
structure, but at the same time,
the College of Engineering itself
has changed dramatically both
in size and in structure," said
UMEC President Max Olender,

an Engineering senior. "We
decided it'd be best to start from
scratch, evaluate the needs of
the College and our students to
come up with a completely new

"What's needed is not a10 per-

of commitment to students who
must attend public schools that
no state official would send his or
her child to," he wrote.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent of student life, said that
even if Michigan were to enact
a percent-based policy, it would
not help increase the numbers of
minority students who choose to
enroll at the Ann Arbor campus.
Harper noted that the fac-
tors that usually deter qualified
admitted students from choosing
Michigan include campus cli-
mate, class size and affordability.
Efforts to increase enrollment
numbers are to help convince
admitted students to choose the
University over other schools.
"Our state legislature could

dents.
"To be able to support a stu-I
dent who comes from so far
away, who's very isolated, to be
experiencing this where he'sj
here and he feels like he can't do,
anything," Valadez said. "This isi
an opportunity that feels like we
can do this together. So for us to
do it here, that's very powerful
for us .People are not going to
be quiet. People are not going
to be silenced in Mexico, and in
the United States and around the
world."'
Valadez said the attack, which
targeted a large group of stu-
dents, resonated with many]
across the world.]
"They were being brought up1
to be critical thinkers and I think
that alot of the fighting of what's
happening there is because
these students were speaking
out against injustice and harm
that was happening through the
government's responsibility," she
said.
Eduardo Garcia, one of the
protesters involved in creating
Thursday's event, said the pur-
pose of the demonstration is to
show the University community
that there is a massacre happen-
ing in a neighboring country.
"I think that the U.S. govern-
ment has been really connected
to the Mexican government and
in this case the U.S. government
should pressure the Mexican
government. In the past few
years, many Americans have also
disappeared," Garcia said. "We
want to conjoin all the anger,
direct it at something good, that
will bring change."
During the vigil, Garcia said
there were nearly 30,000 forced
disappearances in Mexico over
the past seven years. At its core,
Garcia said Mexico is really hav-
ing a crisis of student rights.
"It's a war against the people,
a war against the poor, a war
structure for the student govern-
ment."
The new constitution dif-
fers from the old constitution
in aspects relating to legislative
body and executive positions.
Engineering senior Kelsey Hock
stad and Engineering graduate
student Kyle Lady, who sued
UMEC, claimed that UMEC
elections violated their equal
protection and democratic rep-
resentation rights.
Under the current consti-
tution, the legislative body is
composed of delegates from
Engineering student organiza-
tions. To maintain eligibility for
funding, these delegates were
required to attend the General
Council meetings.
"You have a situation where
individuals are almost forced
to participate in this governing
body andtheymaynot want to be
there, theymaynotbe interested.
It's a rather ineffective method,"
Olender said. "It also can make it
fairly difficult for students who
aren't in or heavily involved in
student organizations to have
equal representation."
The new constitution calls for
student-elected representatives
for the legislative body and does
not require representatives to be

appointed by members of Engi-
neering student organizations,
unlike the design of the con-
tested constitution. It has also
reduced the number of members
to any university in the state of
Michigan, but that doesn't mean
that more students would show
up at U of M," she said. "There's
nothing we're going to be able to
put in place that fundamentally
changes students' choices about
where they want go to school."
She further noted how the
University accepts more under-
represented minority students
than those that choose to enroll.
The University admitted
16,047 students this fall, roughly
40.5 percent of whom decided to
enroll.
Harper and Schlissel both
noted steps to increase the num-
ber of minority admits who ulti-
mately enroll.
The University recently hired
Kedra Ishop, who previously
worked at the University of
Texas at Austin, as the Univer-
sity's associate vice president for
enrollment management. The
position was created this sum-
mer.
The role of the enrollment
manager is to increase coordina-
tion between the Office of Under-
graduate Admissions, the Office
of Financial Aid, the Registrar
and the Office of New Student

against the youth, a war against
the students," Garcia said.
Some of the speakers called
for the United Nations to seek
justice while others reminded
each other that as long as the stu-
dents were missingtheir families
would have no peace.
As the speakers recited the
names of each missing stu-
dent, many University students
stopped to listen, take pictures
and sign up for a mailing list to
receive more information.
LSA freshman John Mathew
stopped to check out the protest
and sign up for the e-mail list on
his way to class. He said he had
heard about the news, but didn't
know much about the ongoing
situation in Mexico.
"I think it's an appealing
cause to college studentsabecause
they see the government tak-
ing advantage of the students,"
Mathew said. "Almost like they
are (being) put down, and not
included as amember of the pop-
ulation."
LSA senior Tatiana Bravo met
Godinez earlier while working
on a class project and decided
to attend the vigil to support
him. While she was raised in the
United States, many of her family
members live in Mexico and she
visits there often. She said the
event has affected her greatly, as
she is around the same age as the
disappeared students and also
fears the corruption in Mexico.
"A lot of it is people are really
fed up, people are disappearing
in Mexico and it just gets thrown
under the rug or people look
the other way, that's the norm
and it shouldn't be the norm,"
Bravo said. "If 43 of my friends
went missing on a school day on
campus, the entire nation would
know and it would be a huge
deal, but there it happened and
it's OK."
on the executive board.
DPS Oversight Committee
student representative to be cho-
sen
LSA junior Michael Fakhoury
and Law School student Alan
Nagel are ronning to become the
DPS Oversight Committee's stu-
dent representatives.
The purpose of the committee
is to respond to complaints and
grievances against the depart-
ment or campus police officers.
The group can make recommen-
dations to the executive director
of DPSS on how to address griev-
ances. Recommendations may
include disciplinary action.
The committee comprises of
six members: two student rep-
resentatives, two faculty mem-
bers and two staff members.
All members are elected by
their peers. Student represen-
tatives are elected for one-year
terms, while other members
are elected for two-year terms.
Last year's representatives were
Fakhoury and LSA senior Alexis
Wyckoff.
"When Michigan's legislature
made students one-third of the
DPS Oversight Committee, they
effectively made us one-third of
the conscience for the primary
law enforcement body on cam-

pus," Nagel wrote in an e-mail
to The Michigan Daily. "That's
a significant role for us and rep-
resents a significant amount of
trust in our capabilities."
Programs in an effort to provide
support and resources for newly
admitted students.
Harper said the role of the
enrollment manager is to "court"
students who are admitted to the
University and deciding whether
to attend. She said Ishop thinks
about the process of choosing
schools from the beginning to
the end and is guides students
considering the University with
information such as scholarship
options.
Ishop could not be reached for
an interview.
Harper said many other uni-
versities ask prospective stu-
dents to show them what other
schools are giving them and
attempt to match it - another
initiative Ishop is looking into
implementing.
Harper said the University
needs to better persuade under-
represented minority students to
enroll at the University.
"From the moment we see
someone that's really good,
we're not done until they say that
they're coming and they arrive
on campus," Harper said. "We're
not taking anybody for granted
anymore."

Why we do this

n a recent night in Che-
sebrough Auditorium,
doz-
ens of engi-
neering
students gath-
ered to hear
Prof. Emerita
Lynn Conway
speak on a
topic that was
decidedly and
unashamedly JULIA
atypical for an ZARINA
engineering
lecture: gen-
der dynamics.
Conway, an electrical engineer
credited with developing some of
the design principles responsible
for revolutionizing microelec-
tronics and advanced comput-
ing, was speaking as part of the
Own It keynote lecture, Lead-
ing Inclusion: Gender in Engi-
neering. Own It is a student led
initiative to promote awareness
of social topics in the College of
Engineering.
Throughout her career as an
engineer and prominent trans-
gender activist, Conway has
inspired radical changes in both
the technological standards
and social climates of her field.
In addressing some of her own
experiences as an acclaimed
innovator at both IBM and the
Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, and as associate
dean of engineering here at the
University, Conway's message to
the audience gathered before her
was clear: in your personal and
professional lives, strive to be
daring and adventurous in both
what you do and who you are.
It's a point that speaks to one
of the most elusive and rarely
addressed issues faced by the
engineering community: as peo-
ple who are largely expected to
define ourselves by our compe-
tencies, we often struggle with
identity in the variety of forms
in which it presents itself. On a
societal level, we grapple with
some of the issues Own It works
to discuss. How do we reconcile
our identities as diverse indi-
viduals with a culture that places
the utmost emphasis on uniform
technical capability? On an intel-
lectual level, how do we balance
our curiosity for the abstract
with the concrete demands of
real life? And on a technical
level: how much do we value the
less quantifiable, less practical,
but more human aspects of the
people we are designing for?
When it comes to research in
STEM fields, one of the biggest
hurdles engineers and innova-
tors face is relatability. Beyond
the cultural stereotypes that
all scientists are socially awk-
ward recluses, translating what
we consider to be beautiful and
timely ideas into marketable,
applicable products or systems
comes with its own set of chal-
lenges. In a world motivated
largely by financial and material
gain, the usefulness and neces-
sity of a venture is often framed
and quantified in terms of its
profitability, whether that be
economic or otherwise.
There is no more striking
example of this external justi-
fication than the progression of

our national space program. In
the United States, space explora-
tion has never been more widely
or ardently supported than it
was when it aligned with our
natioqal security interests dur-
ing the Space Race. Even today,
the upcoming Orion mission
to Mars is often justified in the
media as worthwhile because of
the arguably feasible potential
for interstellar mineral mining
or as an alternate habitat in a
not-so-distant future where our
environmentally unsustainable
habits have led to the destruc-
tion of Earth.

A united approach
The 'U' has an opportunity to lead the prioritization of academics
common narrative of late surrounds the separation of
athletics and academics at the University. President
Mark Schlissel has accurately pointed out that "Athletics
isn't part of the mission statement of the University." However,
an attitude of disregard perpetuates a culture that allows the
impact of the Athletic Department's demands on student-
athletes to go unchecked. It has been previously documented
that successful collegiate athletic programs contribute many
academic benefits to their associated universities, indicating that
academics and athletics are not independent. Unfortunately, this
reality creates incentives for the exploitation of student-athletes.
The University is poised to upset this status quo and fix it with
careful hiring of a new athletic director.

LAUREL RUZA I

Regardless of the lengths universities go
to separate athletics from their academic
principles, the two are deeply intertwined.
Collegiate athletics provide universities with
perhaps their most prominent and far-reaching
advertising platform. The NCAA's staggering
television contracts highlight the value the
nation places on collegiate sports, and this
attention inevitably increases for universities
with successful teams. The intimacy of the
relationship between college academics and
athletics cannot be denied; it has even been
quantified in a study by Dong Chung, Harvard
Business School assistant professor of business
administration. His paper, "The Dynamic
Advertising Effect of Collegiate Athletics"
outlines that "when a school goes from being
'mediocre''to being 'great' :on the football
field, applications ,increase by,17.7 percent."
The leading example of this trend took place
in 1984 when Boston College's Doug Flutie
threw a last-second, game-winning Hail
Mary touchdown to trump the University of
Miami. The so-called Flutie Effect caused
the school's application pool to increase by
30 percent in two years. Furthermore, Chung
has found that the sports-induced attention
drew a 4.8-percent increase in the average SAT
score of admitted students, confirming the
influence athletic success has on students of
all academic abilities. A boost in the academic
standing of a university is associated with
a rise in ranking and thus a rise in funding.
These benefits explain whya university would
encourage good athletic performance. To
deny the positive impact successful athletics
has on our university would be unrealistic
and irresponsible.
Unfortunately, it seems that academics
are often sacrificed for athletic performance.
Earlier this year, CNN filed open records
requests at 37 universities and found that 7 to
18 percent of revenue sport athletes players
performed at elementary school reading
levels as indicated by admissions exams such
as the SAT and ACT. If these students cannot
keep up with the rigorous curriculum of the
universities, it is at the fault of the school
for placing unprepared students in a no-win
situation.
The University of North Carolina's solution
to the issue of admitting underprepared
athletes has been the most widely publicized.
An independent investigator found that for
about 18 years, UNC had its athletes take
fake classes to inflate GPA to eligible levels.
Some 3,100 student-athletes were found to
be involved in the scandal. In 2009, similar
athletic fraud occurred at Florida State
University, involving 60 student-athletes.

In 2008, the Ann Arbor News released a
four-part series highlighting the University of
Michigan's questionable practices, including
pressuring student-athletes into certain
majors. The report said, based on a 2007
audit, counselors even used athletes' own
login credentials to alter their schedules. In
2009, the University was found to violate the
NCAA's practice time limits - limiting the
amount of time student-athletes had to devote
to academics - and was placed on probation
for three years.
Many universities have removed the
emphasis on "student" from student-athlete.
If student-athletes are supposed to receive a
top-tier education in exchange for the revenue
they bring universities, it has been found
that they are too often'cheated out of, this
compensation by pressure from counselorsx
and demands from coaches. This culture
continues because of a lack ofleadership from
the NCAA and a universal cowardice from
schools that has led to a textbook prisoner's
dilemma. As Schlissel stated, enforcing
the NCAA limit on practice and workout
hours would be ideal, but doing so would be
"ridiculous" if other universities don't follow
suit. Enforcing the standards may lead to
diminished athletic performance, and no
university will act without the guarantee that
all others will begin to comply as well.
But there is hope. The Big Ten conference
has provided a blueprint to solving the
athletics-academics paradox with a unified
approach that eliminates the cost of being the
first and only school to prioritize academics.
This year the Big Ten conference passed a
resolution that guarantees scholarships to
athletes of all its member colleges for the
entirety of their academic careers. Given they
are in good standing with the institution, this
would no longer allow academic opportunity
to be contingent on athletic performance and
health. The Pac-12has passed a similar reform.
These guarantees are monumental steps
in securing the educational compensation
athletes are entitled to.
Still, more needs to be done. It is
unacceptable that, as Schlissel pointed out,
nobody obeys the NCAA cap on practice hours.
The University of Michigan is in a uniquej
position to deal with these controversies: the
athletic director is currently undetermined.
There is an opportunity to hire a director who
is dedicated to protecting and providing for
the student-athletes as they deserve; one who
is willing to spearhead reform and reach out
to other universities to band together - as the
Big Ten and Pac Twelve conferences have - to
improve the welfare of our student-athletes.

It's On
This week is the first National
Week of Action for the "It's On
Us" campaign. "It's On Us" is a
campaign that was launched by
the White House and the Center
for American Progress' Generation
Progress, an advocacy organization
based in Washington, D.C., this
past September. This campaign was
launched in order to fundamentally
shift the wayin which we think about
sexual assault. It's an opportunity
to say, "not on our campus," "not
anymore" and build off the amazing
momentum that has already
been generated by groups such as
#CarryThatWeight and I Will.,;,
As President Barack Obama said
when launching this campaign, "It's
on all of us to reject the quiet toler-
ance of sexual assault." The goal of
"It's On Us" is to engage students
across campuses in an effort to curb
campus sexual assault and empower
them to be part of the solution rather
than passive bystanders to the prob-
lem. It calls on all ofus to step up and
pledge to create safe environments on
our campus.
Generation Progress made contact
and a coalition of student leaders
was formed. Given the current
campus climate and the ways in
which issues surrounding sexual
assault have been handled in the
past, we believe many students are
becoming disheartened by what they
are seeing. Based on this, we chose to
lead a series of inclusive roundtable
discussions to come up with tangible
policy solutions on how to continue
to improve sexual assault prevention
throughout our college careers.
We also aimed to evaluate our

responsibilities as individuals and
as a community. In order to do this,
the other student leaders and I felt it
was best for this event to be removed
from student organization affiliation
and be a nonpartisan space where all
students felt comfortable expressing
their views and opinions.
Throughout the week, I came
together with other campus leaders
and a wide range of students. The
studentgroupsrangedfromfreshmen
still exposed to first-year sexual
assault prevention programming
to law students who have limited
exposurewto our University's
programming or: misconduct policy.
During the roundtables, we broke
off into small groups with student
facilitators leading the discussion,
and brainstormed ways in which the
University can ensure each student
has and knows what resources are
available for students on campus.
We also dialogued about what we
as students can do to create an
environment where sexual assault
is unacceptable and survivors are
supported and empowered.
Many action items were gener-
ated, including broadening the tra-
ditional narratives regarding sexual
assault. The conversation currently
tends to revolve around assaults
committed by strangers or assaults
that occur at fraternity parties. Yet,
studies have shown perpetrators of
sexual assault are often friends or
acquaintances of the person they
are assaulting. This conversation
also- needs to expand to include
individuals with varying identi-
ties, including: non-binary genders,
sexual orientation, racial and ethnic

minorities, ability status and reli-
gious affiliation. Our current conver-
sations lack diversity and therefore
inclusivity. We know that assaults
affect already marginalized commu-
nities and many students often feel
even more isolated and vulnerable
after an assault. At the roundtables,
we discussed University-sponsored
annual sexual misconduct educa-
tional programming. The University
has beneficial programs in place cur-
rently for freshmen, and expanding
these programs would provide posi-
tive feedback as well as an opportu-
nityfor potential changestoincrease
their overall effectiveness.
It's onus to start the conversation,
but more importantly, it's on our
campus community to listen and act.
These roundtables were the start to
inclusive productive conversations,
but byno meansaretheyour end goal.
Conversations and policy solutions
should be collaborative between sur-
vivors, the student body and admin-
istrators. Our collaboration is needed
to authentically address the needs of
survivors while acting in effective,
legal parameters. There are steps
we need to take, and the planners,
facilitators and many participants
will be meeting in the coming weeks
to determine various impactful stu-
dent-led initiatives moving forward.
In the meantime, we all must pledge
to actively intervene when we think
our friends are in danger. We pledge
to take our peers' and our own safety
seriously. It's on all of us to change
the culture on campus and prevent
sexual assault.

A similar version of this article
was previously published on SAFE's
website.
As students at the University of
Michigan who are committed to the
self-determination and humanity of
all people, we, Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality, call for our
University to stand by its history of
supporting civil and social justice
movements, as well as holding this
institution to the high standard of
leaders and best. We specifically
call upon the University to divest
from companies that profit from the
systematic violation of Palestinian
human rights. In standing by our
moral obligations as University stu-
dents, SAFE officially announces
the launch of its #UMDivest cam-
paign for the 2014-15 academic year.
Palestinian suffering is thor-
oughly documented by scholars,
human rights activists, and world
leaders. Since 1967, Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza have been
living under Israeli militaryoccupa-
tion. This occupation is recognized
as illegal under international law,
with Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories subjected to a system of
discriminatory and arbitrary laws.
Segregated bus systems, restricted
freedom of movement and routine
incarceration without due process
are part of Palestinians' daily real-

ity. In clear violation of the Geneva
Convention, the Israeli government
also forcibly removes Palestin-
ians from their homes which are
demolished to make way for illegal
settlements in the occupied West
Bank. More than 500,000 settlers
currently inhabit the West Bank in
over 100 illegal settlements, which
are subsidized and facilitated by the
Israeli government.
As part of the occupation, Pal-
estinians in Gaza also face routine
military assaults killing thousands
of civilians. Most recently, this past
summer's Operation Protective
Edge, a 50-day long war on Gaza
in which the Israel Defense Forces
killed more than 2,200 Palestin-
ians, wounded 11,000 and displaced
500,000 Gaza residents.
In the case of the University
of Michigan, we are invested in
multiple companies that aid and
facilitate this system of violence and
oppression against Palestinians.
Two examples include Caterpillar
and United Technologies. The
following are examples of the
crimes our University funds:
Caterpillar "manufactures
and provides bulldozers and
civil engineering tools ... used in
demolitions of Palestinians' houses
in the occupied territories, in the
construction of the separation wall

and settlements on Palestinian
land, in military incursions and as
weapons. The Israeli armyhas used
unmanned D9 bulldozers (Dawn
Thunder) in the December 2008
attacks in Gaza" and in the murder
of Evergreen State College student
Rachel Corrie.
United Technologies "produces
Blackhawk helicopters which are
used by the Israeli military to
attack Palestinian cities, refugee
camps and villages. Many civilians
have been killed in these attacks."
As our University remains
invested in these companies, we as
students are complicit in human
rights violations. SAFE calls
upon the University of Michigan
student body to reflect and learn
more about the current situation.
We announce a year-long series of
events to educate our campus and
allow for open discussion on the
#UMDivest initiative. We refuse
to be unwillingly implicated in the
oppression of others and believe
that any prospect for justice and
peace begins with an unconditional
respect for human life and dignity.
In Solidarity,
Students Allied for Freedom

Irrelevent'Newsroom'

ByALEXINTNER
DailyArts Writer
This season of "The
Newsroom" almost didn't
happen. HBO spent months in
negotiations
with Aaron B
Sorkin The
("The Social
Network"), Newsroom
who finally Season 3
agreed to Premiere
return for
six final Sundays at9 p.m.
episodes. The" HBO
announcements
came after
a problematic season with
too many boneheaded and
frustrating moments to make up
for the truly special ones. Sorkin
often has trouble reigning
himself in, loading the dialogue
with pretentious, broad claims
about politics and America.
While the final season premiere
is a bit more controlled, "The
Newsroom" still gets lost in the
big statements.
"The Newsroom" follows
the inner workings of "News
Night with Will McAvoy" on
the fictional network ACN. The
premiere picks up after the
Genoa incident wrecked the
program's reputation with them
getting a chance to "do the news
correctly" during the week of
the Boston Marathon bombings.
In the premiere, the staff tries to
figure out what happened on the
day of the attack itself and the
manhunt that lasted for a week
after.

'Missing' navigtes

New Starz drama
springboards off
strong main cast
By MATTHEWBARNAUSKAS
DailyArts Writer
Starz's new eight-episode
miniseries "The Missing,"
produced by BBC One, opens
with Tony.
Hughes A
(James
Nesbitt, The Missing
"The Series
Hobbit") Premiere
in a French Saturdays at 9 p.m.
pub as he Starz
stares at a
young teenager. He proceeds.
to ask the-kid how ;old he is.
"Thirteen," the boy says. The
boy's mother looks back with
apprehension. "I'm sorry, I
have a son his age," Tony tries
to reassure her.
However, Tony's son Oliver
(newcomer Oliver Hunt) has
been missing for eight years,
and a puzzle bridging the
} past and present begins to
unfold. Alternating between
the initial disappearance of
Oliver eight years prior and
Tony's renewed search in
2014, "The Missing" lays its
pieces expertly in its premiere
episode "Eden."
Visually, "The Missing"
immediately captures the
dynamic between flashbacks
and the present. The past is
rendered in bright colors, a
vibrant life for Tony, his wife
Emily (Frances O'Conner,

"Al.") and Oliver. As soon as
Oliver goes missing, this ideal
vision gives way to darker
tones. The present, with muted
colors, seems sapped of life
and happiness for any of the
characters. The welcoming
French town of Chalons du
Bois becomes an isolating
place for the characters that
return to it.
Nesbitt is fantastic as a
man grasping for straws in
his search for a needle in a
haystack. Nesbitt's joy in the
opening flashbacks gives
way to panic then transforms
to quiet desperation in the
present day. His situation is
described by retired French
detective Julien Baptiste
(Tchdky Karyo, "The Patriot?%
"Tony is in Chalons duonBois
because there he can believe
that his son is not gone -
that somewhere he is now 13
years old and playing football
and starting to think about
girls." As he wanders through
the French town, Tony is a
small, lost man dwarfed by
the mystery around him and
overwhelmed by the fanatical
belief that his son is still alive.
While Tony holds onto
the past, others try to move
forward. Emily seems to
have started a new life with
Mark Walsh (Jason Flemyng,
"X-Men: First Class").
However, Oliver's specter
is a shadow over her and its
hold on her is worsened as
she becomes aware of Tony's
search. Although Julien
discourages Tony from going
any further when he says,

"This isn't good for you," he
slowly finds himself climbing
down the rabbit hole again.
Tony's obsession is a black hole
that draws others in no matter
how much they try and escape
it.
Written by Harry and Jack
Williams ("Roman's Empire"),
"The Missing" skillfully
handles its interlocking past
and present. The mystery
around Tony's search begs the
question "What will happen?"
as Tony is joined by Julien to
follow the one lead he has.
Meanwhile, the state of the
characters in the present
asks, "What happened?" Both
questions are equally enticing,
and the secret of Oliver's fate
serves as the focal point -
but just as intriguing are the'
reasons for Tony and Emily's
separation and the origin of
Julien's limp. "The Missing"
drops hints in the present
around the initial investigation
eight years ago that naturally
lead to curiosity about what
went wrong, while events and
details from the past echo
hauntingly in the present.
The title "Eden" captures
the sanctuary of happiness
for Tony's family in the past
that is ripped away suddenly.
While in the present, the new
gardens that people have made
are in danger of being torn
down by Tony's temptation to
find the truth. "The Missing"
is a visually and cerebrally
engrossing series whose
answers may destroy any
semblance of safety left for the
characters' past and present.

'Getting' hilarious TV

and sterile,

lit hallways, Getting On

walls and Premiere
wards that Sundays,

paranoid vibe
of impending H B
doom -
warranted or not. It's no suprise
that a hospital, with its literal
undertones of life and death,
is one of Hollywood favorite's
backdrops. In today's long-lived
medical dramas "House" and
"Grey's Anatomy," hospitals
are morbidly glamorous,
with beautiful nurses and
brooding doctors who perform
miraculous procedures by day
and enjoy Scotch by night, all
while looking irresistible in
latex gloves.
What do these shows lack?
Well, quite frankly, a reality
check, because hospitals are
awkward spaceswithoutscripts
on how to act. While death is
often glamorized on TV, the
dark reality is that death simply

happens - usually not due to an
erupted vein in a simultaneous
brain-heart-kidney transplant,
but rather by an old fart justi
kicking the bucket. So where's
the show presenting hospitals
in their unglamorized glory?
Enter "Getting On," HBO's
version of the British show
of the same name, a darkly
comedic series following the
day-to-day happenings in a
geriatric hospital ward. The
show premiered in November
of 2013 with a short six-
episode season. Despite its brief
airtime, the series stirred up
enough critical praise for it to
be renewed for a second season,
withtheravingconsensusthatit
captured the unfiltered reality
of the hospital and its irritable
patients and exasperated
workers, addressing the futility
of life ina darkly comedic way.
The core crew is back this fall
for season two, made up of fast-
talking Dr. Jenna James (Laurie
Metcalf, "The McCarthys"), a
greedy and egotistical doctor
who likes to use her patients
for her own research purposes;
Dawn (Alex Borstein, "Family
Guy"), the emotionally unstable
head ward nurse who is
victimized by Dr. James; Didi
(Niecy Nash, "Reno 911"), a
grossly underpaid nurse who

is probably the most competent
and empathetic worker in
the ward; and Patsy (Mel
Rodriguez, Gommunity");
the new, sexually-confused
supervising nurse romantically
linked with Dawn, whose
modern ideas clash with those
of Dr. James.
"Getting On" continues to
follow the working lives of the
crew with zooming close-ups a
la "Office Space," a wink at the
irony of a hospital being more
similarto acorporateworkplace
than a dramatic stage. The
geriatric ward of Mt. Palms
Hospital is dull, run-down and
overwhelmingly depressing, as
if someone drained all the color
from the walls, the croaking
patients and their caregivers.
In such a morbid place, with
death literally knocking on the
door, black humor is the only
way to process what's going on.
Season two promises the
same bleak humor that made
the first season stand out - a
unique blend of situations that
are at once horrible and weirdly
moving. "Getting On" is the
kind of show that makes it both
hard to laugh and hard to cry,
where doctors aren't heroic and
patients aren't sympathetic. It's
sickly, darkly and disturbingly
funny because it's real.

The weird, amazing,
freaky Deschanel duo

COURTESY OF TONY LUCCA
"I hear CeeLo whenever I sing. I can't help it anymore."
Lucca brings his
'Voice' to Detroit

ByHAILEY MIDDLEBROOK
DailyArts Writer
In an interview with Emily
Deschanel, Conan O'Brien
asked whether she and her
younger sister, Zooey, were
competitive growing up
together, considering they're
acting on the same TV network.
"Well we get along very well
now," Emily said slyly. "I would
kind of torture her. I was the
older sister, and it was just.
the two of us. So I would play
mental games with her. My
favorite one was where I would
tell her that I was from Neptune
(that I was Neptunian) and I'd
killed her sister, taken over her
body, and I was going to kill her
next."
I'd expect no less from
the woman who has become,
at least for me, the living
embodiment of Temperance
"Bones" Brennan on FOX's
nearly decade-old crime
comedy-drama "Bones." The
eldest Deschanel debuted in
2005 as the brilliant, highly
rational and sometimes cold
anthropologist, who works with
her sexy FBI sidekick to solve
crime murders in the D.C. area.
Her partner, Booth, is
usually in charge of the more
"personal" side of cases, like
talking with mourning families.
Bones, on the other hand, scorns
relationships and cuts the crap

subject between the two. Once,

"(Tony and I) are friends,

Pearsall said. "Especially when

kind of inspire each other to get

Lucca and Pearsall both
currently reside in Nashville
and are sure to bringtheir Music

Detroit's revitalization, the city
is brimming with potential.

creativity comes innovation;
Detroit is experiencing the

fashion meets attitude. As

about the motives and ideas
behind his company. Marcial
noted that the idea came about

"We wanted something fun

Marcial, who has roots in
Detroit, constantly promotes
the- city as the Paris of the

a reason Detroit natives have
remained proud despite the
bankruptcy and negative media
coverage in the past two years.
"Creative people in the

"That's a key element, when

Wolverines survive Detroit

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Bogged down by a ,sloppy
start, the Michigan men's
basketball team found itself tied
with Detroit, 52-52, with just five
minutes to play.
The Titans had just chipped

great and
Fab Five member Juwan Howard
- and were in position to make a
late push for an upset.
But the Wolverines simply
wouldn'tlet ithappen.
Michigan's "big three" -
junior guard Caris LeVert,
sophomore forward Zak
Irvin and sophomore guard
Derrick Walton Jr. - put up 16
of Michigan's final 19 points
down the stretch to put away
Detroit, 71-62.
LeVert led Michigan (3-0)
with 21 points, nine rebounds
and three assists, and Howard
led all scorers with 24 points.
Coming off a sluggish start
in the first half, LeVert and
company made their presence
felt after the break behind 17
second-half points from the
junior captain, who scored 10
straight to give Michigan a 43-34
lead and allthe momentum.
"I got an easy layup in
transition, and I felt my rhythm
coming back a little bit," LeVert
said. "I took it upon myself
to be a little more aggressive.
The coaches put the ball in my
hands and had a great deal of
confidence in me. I just wanted
to come through for the team."
The Wolverine run started
when Irvin and redshirt
freshman forward Mark Donnal
forced a turnover on a trap
behind the arc, and while Irvin
missed the transition 3-pointer,

Junior guard Caris LeVertescored a team-high 21 points as the Wolverines pulled away late to beat Detroit, 71-62.

the increased energy on defense
made a noticeable difference.
Donnal added a block on the
next Detroit possession, and
LeVert took a steal coast-tp-coast
for a lay-in two minutes later to
give the Wolverines a 35-34 lead
that they would relinquish only
momentarily on Howard's and-1
layup to tie the game.
Over the course of LeVert's
takeover, the Michigan defense
held Detroit without a point for
six minutes.
"That was something
definitely, at halftime, that was
an adjustment we wanted to
make," Irvin said. "Just heat 'em
up a little bit. When our defense
turns into our offense, we're
pretty good."
In the first half, though,
Michigan showed no reason to
believe anoffensive outburst was
coming.
The Wolverines started
slowly and didn't break out of
it until the half's final minutes,

ultimately shooting just 10-for-
29 from the floor and 3-for-12 on
3-pointers in the first half Still,
midway through the frame, they
found themselves up by a bucket
despite their sloppy play.
Even Irvin, usually a sure-
handed shooter, wasn't able to
get going initially, starting 1-for-
8 from the field.
"Wereallyjustweren'tmaking
shots," Irvin said. "We got sped
up a little bit with the way they
were playing defensively.
"We figured we were going
to see that - pressuring the ball
a lot, (trying to) take away our
offense. We've just to stay poised
and stay in the flow of our game
and not get sped up."
Irvin sank two triples to give
the Wolverines a lead late in the
first, buta put-back jumper atithe
buzzer by Detroit guard Anton
Wilson sent the Titans into the
breakup a point, 28-27.
Riding some carry-over
momentum, the Titans came out

firing the second frame, putting
up six points in the first minute-
and-a-half But once Michigan
turned up its defensive intensity
and LeVert got going, the Titans
had to rely on Howard to keep
them in it.
And for a while, he did, but
the - Wolverines quieted the
Detroit comeback with a decisive
11-point run on the shoulders of
their big three.
LeVert, Irvin and Walton
combined for 45 of the team's 71
total points.
After his slow start, Irvin
finished with 18 points on 4-for-
10 shooting from three, while
Walton posted six boards to
accompany his 16 points.
But ultimately, it was LeVert's
takeover that swung the game
for Michigan.
"He's one of those guys
that's multi-dimensional," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.
"He's so quickand he can get into

Michigan opens BIG play vs. Penn St.

First meeting since
Nittany Lions
ended Wolverines'
season in 2013-14
By JEREMY SUMMIT
Daily Sports Editor
This weekend is personal for
the Michigan hockey team.
The Wolverines (4-5) will
open Big Ten play with a bitter
taste in their mouths when
they host Penn State (6-2-2)
for a weekend series. While
Michigan hasn't had the start
it would've liked to begin the
2014-15 campaign, the ending
of last season was far more
tormenting.
The simple utterance of
'Penn State' might still haunt
some Wolverine fans after the
Nittany Lions, who won, 2-1, in
a double-overtime loss against
Penn State in the inaugural Big
Ten Tournament. The loss left
multiple Wolverines with tears
in their eyes.
"That was a tough loss for
our team," said junior forward
Andrew Copp. "If we win that

game, we're in the (NCAA) A fresh season doesn't

Nittany Lions.
"We saw some breakdowns

Penn State ranks among the
nation's best in goals scored
with a hefty average of 3.80
per game. It boasts the nation's
leading scorer in forward
Taylor Holstrom, too, who has
16 points thus far with three
goals and 13 assists.
But if Michigan's blue
liners aren't able to stymie the
Nittany Lions' potent attack,
there might be one man who
can. Sophomore goaltender
Zach Nagelvoort picked up his
first two wins of the season
in net last weekend, and with
that came some much-needed
confidence. Most importantly,
he has a respectable track
record against Penn State.
In the same heartbreaking
loss to the Nittany Lions last
year, Nagelvoort set a school
record for saves in a single
game.
The Holland native stopped
63 of 65 shots in a remarkable
outing when the defense in
front of him couldn't do much
to keep opposing shot attempts
off target.
"(The game) was
disappointing," Nagelvoort said.
"There were a lot of guys that
played really well in that game.
... No one was giving anything
up easy, so it was good but at the
end of the day they came out on
top, and I don't think our guys
are going to forget that.
"I think that's going to be
something that will be fueling
us for not just this game, but
every time we play them this
year."
But this Penn State squad
isn't the same one that broke the
Michigan players' hearts last
season. They're much improved,
which will mean an even larger
uphill battle for each Wolverine
that wants to fulfill the sweet
feeling of revenge.

was a different story.
Despite having four players
in double figures for the third-
straight game, the Wolverines
(2-1) shot just 38 percent from
the field. Pittsburgh (2-1), on the
other hand, knocked down over
half of its shots - including 13,
of 26 3-pointers - en route to an,
85-64 victory.
"(The Panthers) definitely
shot the ball really well," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "Every time we did make
arun, itwasliketheyhitadagger
three, and then easily followed it
up with another three."
Though they won the war in
the paint, frequent turnovers
prevented the Wolverines from
getting momentum, save for a
9-0 burst to start the second
half. Freshman guard Katelynn
Flaherty had six turnovers
despite her 13 points, and Goree
had five before she turned up her
game in the second half. Overall,
the Panthers picked up 31 points
off of turnovers.
"If we took care of the
ball a little more, coming in
and winning the rebounding
battle, it would've been a
different ballgame," Goree said.
"(Progress) comes from taking
care of the ball, making smart
decisions, being disciplined."
Pittsburgh's offense came
out strong from the get-go, and
Michigan simply couldn't match
its energy level. A quick 17-7

uncharacteristically cold, which
prevented them from getting
back into the game. Sophomore
guard Siera Thompson went
0-for-6 from the floor, snapping
her record streak of 36 straight
games with a 3-pointer to start
her career. Flaherty threw upt
17 snots, but only yfive fund the
net.
Senior guard Shannon Smith
scored a team-high 17 points,
and junior Madison Ristovski
added 11 off the bench, but
neither could energize an
offense that came out flat from
the start.
"I hope that's something
our younger kids will really
see," Barnes Arico said. "You
can't go on the road (and win
easily), especially when a team
is coming off a loss and not
shooting the ball very well and
playing at home. (The Panthers)
had their crowd, they had their
energy and they really came out
of the gates. They had a lot of
confidence."
As the Wolverines head back
home to face Western Michigan
on Sunday, Barnes Arico said
they will look to increase their
effort and intensity to avoid a
repeat performance.
"It's a wake-up call, not only
for the freshman but for us
seniors as well," Goree said.
"We've got to put everything
together or it's going to be a long
ride."

One final chance
to succeed at home

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Managing Sports Editor
DuringBrady Hoke's firstyear as
the Michigan football team's coach
in 2011, he could do no wrong.
Ace the introductory press
conference? Check. Pull out a
miraculous comeback against
Notre Dame, a major rival? Check.
Successfully run a fake field goal
to help blow out a good Nebraska
team? Check. Beat Ohio State?
Check. Make a BCS bowl game
(ahead of Michigan State, no less)
and win it? Check.
Almost every break fell
Michigan's way that season.
The Wolverines recovered 20
fumbles and lost just six. Ohio
State quarterback Braxton Miller
overthrew a wide-open receiver
to miss what would have been a
game-winning touchdown for the
Buckeyes, and Michigan somehow
converted an ugly botched field
goal against Virginia Tech in the
Sugar Bowl.
But three years have passed, and
things aren't quite so rosy anymore.
Saturday marks Senior Day
at Michigan Stadium, when the
program will honor the 12 student-
athletes who will play in their final
home game. It might also be Hoke's
last game there, too.
Since that honeymoon year,
things have only gotten worse
for Hoke and his team - on the
field, at least. Off the gridiron, the
Wolverines insist they're more
tight-knit than ever, and Hoke
expects to be fueled by emotion
Saturday.
"You look at guys who have
worked their tails off for four or
five years," Hoke said Wednesday.
"You look at guys as a coach and as
a mentor (and) how they've grown,
not just from a football standpoint
but guys are graduating, guys
who've grown as men, so there's
always that. I don't know if you get
emotional about not being able to
coach this guy again, that part of
it, but the relationships that you've
built, I think those things really are
the emotional part of it."
Saturday marks the final
home game for fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner and
fifth-year senior middle linebacker
Jake Ryan, among several others.
And while this season hasn't
featured much winning at the Big

House, the group is determined to
end on a positive note.
"I'm just really excited,"
Gardner said. "There's a lot more
at stake than just my last game at
Michigan. It's never been about me,
and it's not going to be about me on
Saturday. I'm just going to go out
and give it everything I have, like
I've always given, to try and get a
win for the team."
But the opponent is no cupcake.
Maryland (3-3, 6-4) boasts road
wins over Iowa and Penn State, so
it shouldn't be fazed by Michigan
Stadium.
The Terrapins aren'tstatistically
dominant in any category; they
rank67th overall inpassingoffense,
67th in points for and 84th in points
against. Most notably, they average
just 113.7 rushing yards per game,
good for just 114th in the nation.
That should play well into the
Wolverines' strength. They rank
seventh in the nation in rushing
yards allowed (103.2) and have
surrendered fewer than three
yards per carry.
But Michigan's defensive line
will be tested in its first game
without senior defensive end
Frank Clark, who was dismissed
from the team Monday amidst
allegations of domestic violence. In
his place, junior Mario Ojemudia
and sophomore Taco Charlton will
likely each see more time at the
position.
"Taco, we all know Taco. He's
made some really good plays
already in his young career,"
said defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison on Monday. "Mario, I
mean, if you really focus, Mario's
done some unbelievable things,
and Brennen Beyer, you don't have
to say much about him. And there's
more and more guys. That's just
the guys at that position or at that
category, so we justkeep going."
Mattison did praise Maryland's
passing attack, which is led by
quarterback C.J. Brown, and
receivers Deon Long and Marcus
Leak. However, the Terps' best
offensive threat, star wideout
Stefon Diggs, will miss the game
with an unspecified injury.
And that might just be enough
for Michigan's veteran defense to
dominate Maryland and - four
seasons after Hoke's tenure began
- end the 2014 home slate on a
positive note.

PAUL SHERMAN/
Fifth-year senior linebacker Jake Ryan will be tasked with keeping Maryland's offense at bay, which
otherwise hasn't been better in one area or the other at making plays.

Fifth-year senior quarterback Devin Gardner hasn't been consistent this season by any means, but he
should see a Maryland pass defense that lacks depth beyond defensive back Sean Davis.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Saturday could mark Michigan football coach Brady Hoke's last game at Michigan Stadium. Last year, the Wolverines' 19-game home winning streak ended.

Having lost three of
last five, Maryland
offense can't keep up
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Let's not beat around the bush: If
the Michigan football team wants
to make a bowl game, it needs to
beat Maryland this weekend.
A matchup with rival Ohio State
looms large next weekend, where
they'll be on the road against a top-
10 team, so the Wolverines need to
take advantage of their last home
game of the season against the
visiting Terrapins.
Michigan (3-3 Big Ten, 5-5 over-
all) is coming off a bye week and
two straight victories, but Mary-
land and its offense could pose
some challenges despite having
lost three of its last five games.
As a new member of the Big Ten,
the Terrapins (3-3, 6-4) haven't
played at Michigan Stadium since
1990, when they lost, 45-17. But with
Michigan native C.J. Brown leading
Maryland under center, the Terra-
pins are ready to challenge the Wol-
verines' chances at a bowl berth.
Here's a breakdown of Michigan's

Senior Day meeting with Maryland.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Maryland pass defense
For better or worse, fifth-year
senior quarterback Devin Gardner
will be playing his last game at
Michigan Stadium, so expect it
to be an emotional one. Gardner
struggled against Northwestern
two weeks ago, but the offensive
line kept his jersey clean for the
first time all season.
The biggest question mark for
the Wolverines will be junior wide
receiver Devin Funchess, who has
struggled with drops in recent
games. And while the emergence
of redshirt sophomore wideout
Amara Darboh has opened things
up, it could be Funchess' last game
in the Big House if he opts to head to
the NFL, so expect him to do every-
thing he can to get back on track.
Michigan's offense could also be
helped by a Maryland defense that
ranks No.84 in the nation in points
against and allows 238.5 yards per
gamethroughthe air. But defensive
back Sean Davis is fourth in the
conference in tackles (94) and held
Michigan State's top receiver, Tony
Lippett, to 46 yards last week, in
what was his least productive game
of the season. Davis will probably

shadow Funchess for much of the
game, but he won't be able to shut

Michigan rush offense vs.
Maryland rush defense
The Wolverines are continuing
their running back-by-committee
approach and will have sophomore
De'Veon Smith and redshirtsopho-
more Drake Johnson splitting car-
ries until one gets the hot hand.
Whoever gets the majority of the
carries should have an easy time
getting by Maryland's defensive
line, though. The Terrapins allow
nearly 200 yards on the ground, so
both backs should be able to keep
up their recent production on the
ground. Gardner said Monday he
has gotten healthier over the bye
week, so the threat of his feet could
also help the backs.
Edge: Michigan
Maryland pass offense vs. Mich-
igan pass defense
Sixth-year graduate quarterback
C.J. Brown should lead Maryland's
offense on Saturday, but the
question is if he will finish. Brown
has struggled mightily this season,
throwing nine interceptions to
11 touchdowns while hovering

around a 50-percent completion
percentage.
The Terrapins top weapon, wide
receiver Stefon Diggs, was ruled
out for Saturday after reportedly
suffering a lacerated kidney. While
Maryland's second receiver, Deon
Long is a strong player, he lacks the
explosive game-changing abilities
that Diggs brings.
For Michigan's secondary, this
game has been circled. Senior
cornerback Raymon Taylor is
playing his last home game for the
Wolverines, while Maryland native
redshirt junior cornerback Blake
Countess will be facing off against
his hometown team.
Edge: Push
Maryland rush offense vs.
Michigan rush defense
Michigan is eighth in the nation
in total defense, and its crown
jewel is its rush defense. The front
seven ranks seventh in the country,
allowing just 103 yards per game.
Brown will keep the defense on
its toes with his mobility, but the
quarterback is the Terrapins'
leading rusher with a paltry 375
yards on the year.
Maryland lacks a true starting
running back and has no other
players that have rushed for more

than 300 yards on the season.
The Wolverines lost senior
defensive end Frank Clark when he
was kicked off the team for alleged
domestic violence charges, but
junior Mario Ojemudia and sopho-
more Taco Charlton should be able
to make up for Clark's absence.
Edge: Michigan
Special teams
This is the one area where
Maryland truly holds the edge.
The Terrapins sport kicker Brad
Craddock, who is a perfect 14-for-
14 on field goals this season. He's
the only kicker in the Big Ten
that's perfect on field goals, but
conditions might be difficult
Saturday with high winds and rain
expected throughout the day.
Edge: Maryland
Intangibles
This is as big of a must-win game
for Michigan as it gets - Senior
Day with a postseason bid on the
line. And after the Wolverines'
tumultuous season, they need
to close out the home slate on a
positive note.
Edge: Michigan

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
People such as Brady Hoke,
Jake Ryan and Jack Miller are all
correct: No one knows what the
Michigan football team is going
through this season.
They don't know about the
distractions off the field that
pop up like a surprise quiz. They
don't struggle with the learning
curve - which can feel more like
a mountain - that comes with a
new offense. Nor do they know
about handling thousands upon
thousands of fans who are quick
to speak out.
But if there's one person who
does know, it might be Steven
Threet. Yes, the same guy
who played one year with the
Wolverines maybe one the people
most familiar with what this
year's team has had to handle.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
This isn't the first rodeo for
Maryland sixth-year graduate
quarterback C.J. Brown, who
has struggled with injuries
throughout his tenure in College
Park. And while Brown is finally
healthy, the Terrapins' starting
quarterback is struggling -
throwing nine interceptions and
just 11 touchdowns on the season.
But through 10 games, the
Michigan native is the team's
leading rusher and has the ability
to keep defenses on their toes
with his mobility.
The Daily sat down with
Brown at Big Ten Media Day in
July to discuss his return to his
home state.
The Michigan Daily: What

are you most excited about with
Maryland joining the Big Ten?
C.J. Brown: I'm just excited
for the new opportunities that
we have, the new attention on
our institution and how we can
represent it in the big light. I
think joining the Big Ten gives us
a lot of opportunities. Obviously,
it brings us revenue, a media
rise in the market that we are in
and the ability to advertise our
athletic ability as well as our
academics.
TMD: How do you think the
Big Ten can help Maryland's
program and bring it into the
national spotlight, something it
struggled to do in the ACC?
CB: It's by ' recognition.
Everyone knows the Big Ten,
especiallyinterms offootball, and
that's huge for us. To go into Ann

Arbor, Penn State, Wisconsin,
Michigan State, just all the
different venues that they have
and become more recognizable.
I think we were recognizable in
the ACC, but now we come to the
"There was no
'go blue' in our
house. It was all
'go green.' "
Big Ten and you understand the
upper-echelon games that they
have really helps us.
TMD: You've had a history of

injuries, what's it been like getting
your body and play to where you
want it to be for the season?
CB: For this season, it hasn't
been too bad. In the past, it's been
challenging to get knocked down
and then get back up. At times,
strength, mobility, confidence, it
takes a wear and tear, but going
into my sixth year I understand
what I need to do to be successful,
to make i through the season by
taking every opportunity I can as
it comes.
TMD: You grew up in Troy,
Michigan; did you grow up a
Michigan fan?
CB: I was absolutely not a
Michigan fan. There was no "go
blue" in our house. It was all "go
green" in my house. Both my
parents are alums of (Michigan)
State, and then my sister is

studying there in the fall.
TMD: How does it feel to have
them on the schedule though?
Are you excited to play at the Big
House?
CB: Absolutely, my whole
family is very excited. That
was the first thing we looked
at when the schedule came
out. Where do we play? Where
do we get to go visit? We get
Wisconsin, the Big House and
Penn State, we get them all. So,
I'm excited for the opportunity,
and now I'm just ready for the
season to start.
TMD:Willyour parents be there?
CB: I'm pretty sure they'll
make the trip to that one.
Honestly, they'll probably be
rooting for Maryland more than
anyone else there because they
have two reasons to.

And Threet is here to tell you
he's right.
"The locker room always
tends to come together in times
of difficulty, or any time you get
some adversity," Threet said.
"There's a lot of turmoil outside of
the football building, and in times
like that, it's good to look inward
to guys who are going through
the exact same situation and work
hard for each other."
Indeed, Threet says he did
the same thing when Michigan

finished 3-9 in 2008, his lone
year in the program. That
season, Threet listened as fans
complained about a coach, losing
to rivals and the
abysmal record.

the scenario where losing out
would mean missing a bowl
berth. They've lost to rivals Notre
Dame and Michigan State in
humiliating fashion, and face the
possibility of losing to Ohio State.
"These guys want to perform
at their best," Threet said. "But
there's the added motivation of
having your back against the wall
and your coach's back against the
wall that plays into it."

opted to leave for his third team,
Arizona State, after his lone year
of playing in Ann Arbor.
But he speaks from.experience
when he says that handling this
season and winning isn't as easy
as it may seem.
"At this point in the season,
it's about trying to make the
best outcome you can with what
situation you're in," Threet said.
"You can't change what happened
in the first 10 games of the year,
but getting the opportunity to
accomplish some positive things
is a big motivator. You want to
leave a positive taste in your
mouth at the end of the year."
He, as much as anybody, would.
know how much of a difference
that would make.
