Pi Kappa Alpha
condemns campus
chapter for party
invitation
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
The national chapter ofPi
Kappa Alpha Fraternity, com-
monly known as Pike, has issued
an interim suspension to their
Beta Tau Chapter at the Uni-
versity following controversy
stemming from the rapid online
spread of semi-nude photos of
its members.
The photos, which featured
members mostly naked with
American flags, were attached
to an e-mail that was sent as a
party invitation to members of
the Alpha Phi sorority this past
Friday.
The e-mail with the pho-
tos stated that Pike members
"paddle pledges because it is
a comprehensive upper body
workout" and that any sorority
member who considered her-
self a "red-blooded, God fearing
American girl who has a spe-
cific spring time gym routine
to accommodate her summer-

time jean shorts" should attend
a party.
Justin Buck, executive
vice president of the national
Pike organization, released
a statement on the organiza-
tion's website condemning
the actions of the University's
chapter, stating that they were
"in violation of Fraternity
Standards."
"Countless undergraduate
and alumni members through-
out our organization have con-
tacted the office voicing their
displeasure," Buck wrote. "The
Fraternity is taking this situa-
tion very seriously."
Buck added that the national
chapter was working with the
Interfraternity Council, the
governing body for fraternities
at the University, to "imple-
ment appropriate punitive and
educational conditions for the
chapter."
The IFC met Monday night to
begin discussing what actions,
if any, to take against the fra-
ternity, University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said. No mem-
bers of the IFC or the Beta
Tau Chapter of Pike could be
reached for comment Tuesday
evening.

Foundation awards
$50K grants to
three professors
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Three University faculty mem-
bers are recipients of the 2013
Sloan Research Fellowships, a
$50,000 research grant present-
ed to early-career researchers.
Assistant Biology Prof. Sara
Aton, Assistant Ecology Prof.
Gregory Dick and Assistant
Chemistry Prof. Stephen Maldo-
nado are three of 126 promising
investigators to receive fellow-
ship. In the last three years, six
University researchers received
SRFs, which is issued by the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
which gives grants to institutions
focused on science, technology
and economics.
Aton - who graduated from
the University in 2001 with a
Bachelor of Science degree and
set up her lab in July 2012 -
expressed her gratitude to be
included with future Nobel lau-

reates. She will use the fellow-
ship, to continue investigating
what she called the "unsolved
mystery of biology."
Aton's lab analyzes two
aspects of memory and sleep:
consolidation - where informa-
tion is encoded into long-term
memory storage - and how neu-
rons in the visual cortex change
after the organism has seen
something new.
"When you're asleep, you're
not looking for food, you're not
looking for mates and you're not
reproducing," Aton said. "So,
from an evolutionary standpoint,
you would think it would not be
selected again unless it was serv-
ing them a very, very important
role that we don't understand
yet."
Most sleep studies involve
sleep deprivation. Uniquely,
Aton's lab studies sleep by turn-
ing on and off certain neurons
and analyzing how those tweaks
affect consolidation.
For Dick, the grant will sup-
port ongoing research in deep-
sea hydrothermal vents. He said
some vents include plumes that

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
For the Daily
One word: Shakespeare.Undis-
putedly one of the greatest liter-
ary and cultural influences of all
time, his works have enthralled
artists, scholars and, most impor-
tantly, audiences, for centuries.
But Shakespearean works often
seem to exist in a type of contra-
dictory space. On one hand, they
can be utterly intimidating, with
"thees" and "thous," the com-
plex soliloquies and the failed
ninth-grade English exams. On
the other hand, there's been a
very real movement, spearheaded
by publications such as No Fear
Shakespeare, to make the works
"accessible" to new generations.
The challenge then, for current
Shakespearean companies, is to
work within the original text to
facilitate and maintain a modern
audience's interest.

N ew e-payment method at Duke

A GRAND SLAM 

Ivy, a new electronic payment
application for students that
automatically connects to either
a bank account or a credit card
number, is being endorsed by
Duke University's student gov-
ernment, The Duke Chronicle
reported Friday.
The new system allows stu-
dents to make transactions elec-
tronically with any other member
of the system, eliminating the
hassle of having to keep track of a
card or even cash.
Duke freshman Alex Semien
introduced the new method of
payment to the student govern-
ment which showed support for
the adoption of this new system.
"Ivy is really innovative, and

it is quick," Semien said. "Hon-
estly, it is the fastest peer-to-peer
system that I have seen. Students
almost never have cash with
them anyway."
Duke sophomore Tre' Ellis
Scott added that Ivy has the
potential to become synced
with students' Duke University
accounts, making online access to
transactions and expense records
simpler for students.
Cornell takes measures to
increase safety for students
traveling abroad
Cornell has implemented a
new online travel registry that
will make traveling abroad safer

for both students and staff, the
Cornell Sun reported Friday.
When students organize a
study abroad semester they are-
automatically registered with the
system and will have access to
emergency travel insurance.
Alexis Santi, coordinator of
travel safety for Cornell Abroad,
said although a number of stu-
dents who independently planned
their trips have registered with
the system, there are still 1,000 to
1,500 who have yetto do so.
Dean of Students Kent Hub-
bell said the system will be bet-
ter able to respond to emergency
situations.

Preparing people to lead extraordinary lives

Gov. may appoint
emergency manager
to handle crisis
-DETROIT (AP) - A state-
appointed review team has
determined Detroit is ina finan-
cial emergency, paving the way
for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
to appoint an emergency man-
ager who would need to come up
with a new plan to get the city
out of its fiscal crisis.
The team released its find-
ings Tuesday, saying in a report
to Snyder that "no satisfactory
plan exists to resolve a serious
financial problem."
The review team pointed to
the city's ongoing cash crisis,
which have threatened to leave
the city without money to pay its
workers or other bills. It noted
that the city's deficit could have
reached more than $900 mil-.
lion in fiscal year 2012 if the city
had not borrowed enormous
amounts of money; that Detroit
has long-term liabilities, includ-
ing underfunded pensions, of
more than $14 billion; and that
the city's bureaucratic structure
makes it difficult to solve the
financial problems.
"The cash condition has
been a strain on the city," said
state Treasurer Andy Dillon,
a member of the review team.
"The city has been running def-
icits since 2005 ... (and) mask-
ing over those with long-term
borrowing."
Under Michigan law, Snyder
has 30 days to decide for him-
self whether there's a financial
emergency. Mayor Dave Bing
would have 10 days to request
a hearing: Snyder could then
revoke his decision or appoint
an emergency manager.
The emergency manag-
er would be responsible for
overseeing all of the city's
spending. Bing and the City
Council would keep their jobs,
but the manager would decide
all financial matters. And only

the manager would have the
power to authorize the city to
take the bankruptcy route.
James McTevia, president
of a Michigan-based firm that
specializes in turnaround man-
agement, said an emergency
manager could halt the city's
borrowing, freeze debt and
restructure finances, including
voiding contracts. "The check-
book needs to be taken from the
politicians," he-said.
However, others said that
even with an emergency man-
ager, municipal bankruptcy
may be the city's only way out
of the financial mess.
"Is it imminent?. Well not
tomorrow," said Doug Ber-
nstein, managing partner of
the Banking, Bankruptcy and
Creditors' Rights Practice
Group for Michigan-based
Plunkett Cooney law firm "You
need to give a financial man-
ager the opportunity to formu-
late a plan and let the plan have
a chance to succeed or fail. It
may not avoid a bankruptcy,
but you don't need to do a bank-
ruptcy today."
Snyder spokeswoman Sara
Wurfel said he will review the
team's report carefully.
"He won't make a determi-
nation immediately, but sooner
rather than later," she said.
"The governor believes that a
strong and successful Detroit
is key to Michigan's continued
comeback."
Bing said Tuesday's report
shouldn't have surprised any-
one. -
"My administration has been
saying for the past four years
that the city is under financial
stress," Bing said in an emailed
statement. "If the Governor
decides to appoint an emer-
gency financial manager, he or
she, like my administration, is
going to need resources - par-
ticularly in the form of cash and
additional staff.
"As I have said before,
my administration will stay
focused on the initiatives that

most directly impact the citi-
zens of Detroit: public safety,
public lighting, transportation,
recreation and neighborhood
blight removal."
Each of the six review team
members agreed on the finan-
cial emergency determination,
Dillon said.
If Snyder moves ahead and
appoints an emergency man-
ager, Detroit would be the sixth
and largest city in Michigan to
have one. The cities of Benton
Harbor, Ecorse, Pontiac, Flint
and Allen Park are currently
under state oversight. School
districts in Detroit, Highland
Park and Muskegon Heights
also have managers.
A new state law taking effect
in late March gives local gov-
ernments the chance to choose
their own remedy when a
review team finds a financial
emergency exists: However,
Detroit loses those options if
an emergency manager is put in
place before the new law goes
into effect, said Terry Stanton,
Treasury spokesman.
City Council President Pro
Tem Gary Brown said the pace
of fiscal change in Detroit has
been too slow.
"The political will has often
not been there to make the nec-
essary and bold fiscal reforms,"
Brown said in a written state-
ment. The statement went on
to say, "Without a doubt, we
need the support and account-
ability that a State of Michigan
partnership offers. We cannot
address our legacy obligations
alone. And, as Detroit goes, so
goes Michigan."
Now that the depth of
Detroit's woes is clearer, the
most efficient path to recovery
needs to be taken and that falls
to Snyder, Dillon said.
"A lot of the ingredients for
the turnaround of the city are
in place," Dillon said. "Now we
just need to execute. I do believe
strongly that Detroit is fix-
able and can see brighter days
ahead."

Colorado's Democratic-con-

* Syrian missle
strike kills
33 people
A Syrian missile strike leveled
a block of buildings in an impov-

Tuesday, killing at least 33 peo-
ple, almost half of them children,
anti-regime activists said.
Many were trapped under the
rubble of destroyed houses and
piles of concrete and the death
toll could still rise further if
more bodies are uncovered.
The apparent ground-to-
ground missile attack struck a
quiet area that has been held by
anti-regime fighters for many
months, a reminder of how dif-
ficult it is for the opposition to
defend territory in the face of the
regime's far superior weaponry.
In the capital Damascus,

BroBible writer Andy Moore
said the actions of the national

and blatant abuse of the nation-

al fraternity's power." He
added that he believes both the
photos and e-mail are harmless
and humorous.
"The photos were hilarious,
a clear turn of gender norms
that showed the guys could
'objectify' themselves without
asking the women to do the
same," Moore wrote.
Jeezebel contributor Lindy

Pike, while not all that offen-
sive, showcased the immatu-
rity of some college-aged men,
especially those in Greek life.
"Obviously this is not a big
deal, in the scheme of things,
but I think it's worth reit-

America that not everybody is

Regardless of the outcome of
the March election, Swider said
members of momentUM will be
involved in student organizations

COUNCIL ALLOCATES
PACE BONDS
Afterapostponementatthelast
City Council meeting, a resolu-
tion to allocate up to $1 million in
Property-Assessed Clean Energy
bondswas passed Tuesdaynight.
The city's PACE program
was created after it received
$432,800 in bonds from the U.S.
Department of Energy. The goal

In previous research, the team
collected samples from vents and
examined them inthelab.
"So far, what we've done is
cataloging what's there, and
that's generated a lot of hypoth-
eses," Dick said. "Now, we'd like
to test those hypotheses with real
experiments on the seafloor."
Maldonado's electrochem-
istry projects seek to develop
new processes for renewable
energy technology. He predicts
the majority of the funds will be
devoted to researching an effi-
cient way ofproducingcrystalline,
or puresilicon.
In order to produce silicon
chips, which are used in tech-
nologies ranging from comput-
ers to solar cells, the silicon
dioxide found in nature is heat-
ed up with charcoalto yield pure
silicon. The energy-intensive
process releases a large amount
of carbon dioxide,which Maldo-
nado hopes to change.
"We hope that this process
will ultimately fill a niche," Mal-
donado said. "It would allow the
possibility of scaling stuff up
without it having such a huge
energy cost and environmental
impact."
is to improve the city's energy
efficiency and help businesses
increasetheir use of clean energy.
The proposal includes the
allocation of bonds to several
different areas and businesses -
including Big Boy on Plymouth
Road, Bivouac on State Street,
the Goodyear building on S.
Main Street, and Kerrytown
Market & Shoppes - for energy-
efficient upgrades in such as
lighting and infrastructure.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje commended the proposal for
allowing businesses to increase
their energy efficiency at a low
cost to the city.
However, Councilmem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1)
expressed some concern that
single-family homes would not
receive funding.
"Inthe couple ofyears leading
up to the state approving PACE
funding and the city initiating
this project, a lot of us hoped that
we'd have PACE funding for sin-
gle-family homes," Briere said.
However, this concern did
not keep Briere from voting in
favor of the resolution, noting
that she believes these bonds are
extremely effective regardless.

They are investigating a tech-
nique involving liquid metals,
which involves lower tempera-
tures and thus less energy, to
produce the crystalline silicon.
"We use a liquid metal to
both reduce the oxidized silicon
precursor and then we use that
liquid metal as a solvent to grow
crystals," Maldonado said. "You
have control over how the crys-
tals come out, and that's really
important when you want to start
thinking about making devices."
By expediting this and other
processes, Maldonado said solar
energymightbecomecheaperand
more accessible for consumers.
"If you can simplify the
process, you can cut down on
the steps," Maldonado said.
"If you can make it so you
don't have to go to ungodly
temperatures then everything
becomes more affordable,
more scalable."
Maldonado believes that the
SRF is just as much of an acco-
lade as motivation.
"I see it both as a nice honor
for where we're at but it's also
humbling because now I know
where we need to get going or
where our science needs to go."
"I think PACE funding is
one of the most effective ways
of decreasing our energy foot-
print," Briere said.
RESOLUTION TO ADOPT
SUSTAINABILITY
FRAMEWORK
City Council also agreed to
launch theAnnArbor sustainability
framework project Tuesdaynight
The project, which is funded
by the Home Depot Founda-
tion, contains 16 objectives to
improve the city's sustainabil-
ity. It launches a 18-month plan
to improve sustainability, tak-
ing actions such as maximizing
the use of sustainable energy
and promoting the construc-
tion of more sustainable build-
ings. The plan also attempts to
provide more non-motorized
travel options, such as bicycling
and walking, and plan for more
mixed land use.
Although there was not much
discussion on the matter, Coun-
cilmember Jane Lumm (I-Ward
2) noted that there was much
work put into the project before
the approval was granted Tues-
day night.


PERFORMANCE
From Page 1A
looks to strike that delicate bal-
ance with its unique and str enu-
ous physical approach. Propeller,
an all-male Shakespeare company,
strives to vigorously engage and
explore the relationship between
text and performance. There's a
strong narrative structure within
Shakespearean plays that gives
them an energy and rhythm.
"Most of the audiences of these
plays were illiterate and yet they
understood what was going on,"
said Edward Hall, director and
founder of Propeller. "There is
a robustness, and a clarity, and
a formula to how Shakespeare
writes. People name each other at
the beginning of scenes. They say
where they are, who they are, what
they want, and the scene discusses
that.Ifsomebodyhasalongspeech,
however complicated it gets, down
at the bottom you'll find two to four
lines that sumit all up."
Propeller performances utilize
a full range of artistic dimensions,
such as music, film animation and
mask work to further examine the
text. The actors themselves play a
significant role in the actual logis-
tics of a performance.
"I knew I wanted to take away
some of the gifts of the modern
indoor theater and give back to
the performers the task of creat-
ing the performance experience,"
Hall explained. "Scene changing,
sound effects, music - all of those
things would go back to the actors
to author. We don't use recorded
sounds, and we even get the actors
to light the scenes sometimeswith
torches or with lights they carry
around. It seems to fit the bur-
lesque, and certainly metaphoric
energy, of Shakespeare's plays."
Propeller will perform two plays
at the University, "Twelfth Night"
and "The Taming of the Shrew."

"Twelfth Night" encompasses
all the elements of Shakespeare's
best comedies: mistaken identi-
ties, skewed love connections and
a wide array of intriguing char-
acters. The story follows Viola, a
young woman who has been ship-
wrecked on the coast of Illyria. To
gain employment, she disguises
herself as a man named "Cesario"
and begins to work for Duke Ors-
ino. Orsino uses "Cesario" to send
love messages to Lady Olivia. In
true Shakespearean fashion, Viola
falls in love with Orsino, Orsino
continues to pine for Olivia and
Olivia falls in love with "Cesario".
Shakespeare's take on love and
gender is surprisingly modern.
"He's not sayinggender isimpor-
tant. He's saying the opposite: Gen-
der is not important," Hall said.
"What's important is love. We get
very hungup on labels and sexuality
when, in fact, we're all talking about
thesame feelings.Iliketothinkthat
bubbles up a little more readily to
the surface in our production."
"The Tamingofthe Shrew" cen-
ters on two wealthy sisters, Kath-
erine and Bianca. The girls' father,
Baptista, decrees that Bianca may
not marry before her shrewish
older sister. Bianca's suitors team
up with Petruchio, who happens
to be seeking a rich wife, in order
to wed off Katherina. Petruchio
tries to "tame" her through a series
of comical but also rather cruel
antics. Other modern productions
have tried to play off the taming
as ironic or planned, but Propeller
takes a more traditional approach.
"We've embraced both the brutal-
ity in the play and also the high farce
and comedy of the play," Hall said.
"The mixture of those two things
makesforveryinterestingdrama."
So why, after all these years, do
people still care aboutthebard?
"What's lasting about his work is
he makes it pertinent to you, today,
nearly 500 years later, in a way that's
unexpected.'

In second year, Council
faces attendance issues

VP Hashwi remains
optimistic for
future of struggling
University Council
By STEPHEN YAROS
Daily StaffReporter
As most students know from
experience, group work can
be tiresome. The Central Stu-
dent Government's University
Council is learning this the
hard way.
The University Council
was created in 2010 as part of
CSG's new constitution and is
one of two entities that make
up the legislative branch,
the other being the Student
Assembly. It is comprised of
one representative from each
school's respective govern-
ment.
Despite good intentions,
the group seems to be having
trouble getting off the ground
this year. Attendance has been
poor at the group's biweekly
meetings.
The council approved a
CSG election director at last
Wednesday night's meeting,
but only five schools were
there to make the decision.
Michael Benson, Rack-

ham Student Government
president and RSG repre-
sentative on the UC, said
though the council may be
having trouble, its purpose
is clear: to foster collabora-
tion between student gov-
ernments at the various
schools and colleges.
Benson acknowledged
that UC is not living up to its
potential. As a contributor
to the UC's constitution, he
thinks there may be a core
problem.
"Well, the fact that under
our constitution the University
Council has no real authority
for anything is a problem."
CSG vice president Omar
Hashwi, the UC president,
seemed more optimistic.
"I see the UC as a body on
campus that is very highly
respected by the students, by
the administrators, with a lot
of authority to make change on
campus," Hashwi said.
Hashwi also acknowledged
that the UC has issues but
seemed hopeful for future
progress.
"Because this is very new
- let's say it hasn't taken off
yet," Hashwi said. "I think
that it (the UC) has a lot of
potential, and most of it is
untapped."
When asked about the lack

of meeting attendance, Hash-
wi said he's unsure how exact-
ly to solve the problem.
However, Benson said he
believes graduate school gov-
ernments tend to contact each
other directly instead of going
through the UC.
Another issue that may be
stunting the progress of the
UC is the lack of available
information about the coun-
cil.
If someone looks on
CSG's website for specifics,
they find a link to the UC's
minutes, membership and
resolutions. However, all
of these links lead to blank
pages.
The UC's next meeting
is Wednesday, March 27, at
which University President
Mary Sue Coleman will be in
attendance.
Hashwi believes the admin-
istration understands the
importance of the UC and
knows it represents the stu-
dent voice. Although not all
has gone as planned for the
UC, he said he is not discour-
aged.
"We've been trying our
absolute best to make it the
most impactful it can be,"
Hashwi said. "It has not
reached its potential, but we
are getting very close."

Open(er) housing
Gender-neutral options should be campus-wide
fter years of debate surrounding the Open Housing Initia-
tive, the University will begin to offer gender-neutral housing
options in the dormitories fall 2013. The newly renovated East
Quad Residence Hall will allow a small number of students to live in
gender non-restrictive rooms as part of the Gender Inclusive Living
Experience, a new living community. The University's acceptance and
implementation of this policy is a critical step in ensuring the safety
and comfort of all students in the Michigan community. Moving for-
ward, however, the University must become more expansive with their
gender-neutral policies and increase the scope of the housing policy so
all students have access.

Last month, The Michigan Daily reported
that GILE will be based in East Quad Resi-
dence Hall. The new living community will
allow students who "identity as transgender,
gender non-conforming or as allies" to select
a roommate of whichever gender they see fit
and connect with a community of like-minded
students. In order to accommodate these stu-
dents, East Quad has set aside a total of 12 beds
for interested students. This initiative is in
response to the growing support for a petition
introduced in 2008 by the Open Housing Ini-
tiative, which fought for more inclusive living
options. Four years later, the University has
slowly progressed toward expanding its hous-
ing policies.
The GILE community will provide a safe
and accepting environment for students who
do not fit the restrictive, typical gender roles.
Students should be stressing about homework,
not they're living situation. It's also notable
that this is one of the few programs around the
country that allows freshmen to participate,
according to the National Student Gender
Blind campaign.
In comparison to other schools across the

country, however, the University has a long
way to go. Wesleyan University, for example,
has been accommodating its gender-neutral
students since 1995. Rather than a limited
number of beds - as is the case with the
University's current plan - Columbia Uni-
versity has standardized gender-neutral
housing into its housing application process.
Although moving in the right direction, the
University is lagging behind both in scope
and technique. Twelve beds can hardly be
expected to be enough to accommodate
a school of 27,000 undergraduates. And
although a gender-neutral living community
can offer support to those who want it, some
students may prefer to not to be so visibly
labeled and would rather opt for gender-neu-
tral housing without automatically entering a
living community.
Instead of limitingthis to a specific commu-
nity, all residence halls should be tolerant of
student identity. The University of Michigan
prides itself on promoting diversity within our
community. In order to live up to that reputa-
tion, gender-neutral housing needs to be made
available to all students.

a

Continual scientific progress is one of the
few things that we can count on in this world.
With millions of researchers conducting mil-
lions of experiments every year to probe every
niche this universe has to offer, we are close to
certain that every day we will know just a little
bit more about ourselves and our world. Every
step made by a researcher may not be in the
right direction, but it invariably contributes
to science's ceaseless march forward into the
unknown. The work of science is some of the
best work that human beings have ever taken
up. And yet the journalism describing it is often
misguided, overly ambitious or erroneous.
From my experience, the vast bulk of writing
on science can take one of two approaches: the
boring and the bombastic. Most popular publi-
cations let us leave aside the boring for now and
focus on the bombastic. Rarely a week goes by
without seeing a news outlet declaring some
major advance in scientific knowledge that
will revolutionize humanity in some way or
another. Cures for cancer, new energy sources
and genes of all sorts - this is fodder for con-
temporary science journalism, grist for the
24-hour news cycle milling out content as fast
as it can. The journalistic apparatus we have to
work with is a great machine for getting facts
out, but given the noise from the constant hum
of news, if anything is to be heard - such as a
great discovery by scientists - the signal must
be amplified.
This amplification lies at the heart of the
disconnect between science and writing about
science, though there are a few overlapping
qualities between the fields of science and
journalism: curiosity, attempted objectivity
and the search for answers. They operate on
vastly different time scales and seek vastly dif-
ferent ends. Where scientific writing requires
immense context to be understood, journalistic
writing should be understood at first glance.
The journalistic formula relying on bold, con-
cise headlines and a skeletal structure fleshed
out with handpicked quotes doesn't effectively
communicate the scientific enterprise. If a
headline in a newspaper read, "Bomb blast in
Afghanistan kills dozens," we would all read-
ily understand it. The significance of something
like, "Largest known prime number found,"
is harder to assess. This speaks to the chasm
between the public's and the scientists' under-
standings of science.
That second approach to scientific writing

is partly to blame. It's boring. Not only that,
but leafing through nearly any scientific jour-
nal will serve to convince just about anyone
that the material is thoroughly unintelligible
to the uninitiated. Worse yet, the language
scientists use to write to other scientists is
often barren, tedious and dreary. Rare is the
occasion that one finishes reading a scientific
publication with the same excitement with
which one began.
There are several reasons for this situation.
Partly it's from the fact that researchers chose
to be scientists, not writers, partly because
scientists often merely catalogue and report
their findings - a rarely inspired form of writ-
ing - and partly because there's an unspoken
convention that being too dry is better than
personalizing one's prose. If journalists had to
explore journals to get scientific stories, there
would be far fewer scientific stories than there
already are.
Thus, the rise of the scientific press release.
Straddled uncomfortably between the boring
and the bombastic, the scientific press release
has to express often quite humdrum research
in a rousing way in order for it to get pub-
lished. Unfortunately, this frequently leads
to overstated conclusions and deemphasized
methodologies, while skirting aspects of peer
review and validation. Much of the noise in
scientific journalism - that is, much of the
confusion among lay readers -- comes from
the clangs of press releases falling through
the press's echo chambers.
How we express information can be nearly
as important as the information we express -
the signal matters only if it is sufficientlylarger
than the noise. The information that scientific
enterprises have given us is among the most
important we could have. We know where
we've come from, what we're made of and how
we relate to the entirety of the cosmos because
people have sought evidence, created theories
and shared what they learned with others. If
we are to understand further frontiers, we can-
not be afraid to take a moment to assess our sit-
uation and discuss it clearly with those around
us, be it the bounds of science or the limits of
writing about science. If our march forward is
to be certain, it helps forcus to be as surefooted
as we can.

Death penalty's real cost

Let's talk chump change, pocket
change, nickels and dimes - that
lucky penny you see on the floor but
walk right past because ultimately,
hey, what good is a penny in the
grand scheme of things? Now let's
talk millions. $308 million to be
exact. We just changed ball games
there - not sure if you noticed.
When someone says the death
penalty is more expensive than
a life without parole, they seem
wrong. However, they're in fact
telling the truth. The death penalty
is millions of federal and state tax
dollars more expensive than a life
in prison without parole. In Cali-
fornia it costs an estimated $308
million per execution. While this
is a morally charged issue, at that
price do we really care what crime
the defendant committed?
In 2012, California voted on the
abolishment of the death penalty.
Since 1977, the current flawed sys-
tem has cost the state about $4 bil-
lion dollars. With 725 people on
death row, California warehouses
almost 25 percent of the country's
total death row population. It costs
about $47,000 to incarcerate a man
for one year in California, but it costs
$90,000 extra per year to house a
man on death row. This puts the
annual death row bill at $137,000 per
person. The cost of one year in gener-
al population is derived from mainly
security and health care, but also
includes food, rehabilitation pro-
grams and facility costs. Additional
death row costs include the officer,
or officers, constantly escorting the
inmates in and out of their prison
cells. Each person awaiting a death
sentence is placed in an individual
cell, while those in general popula-

tion typically share a cell. Individual
supervision is also required for the
two hours of physical recreation
time inmates receive daily.
These are the only costs of incar-
ceration. The court fees are where
the bulk of the costs lie. The trial for
death sentences takes three to five
times longer, needs twice as many
lawyers, has a far more difficult jury
selection process and has a practical-
ly endless appeals process as opposed
to life without parole cases. Of the
725 people on death row in Califor-
nia, only thirteen have exhausted
the appeals process. The majority of
individuals on death row are poor.
Tax dollars are funding virtually
the entire process. However, the
answer is not to try and repair this
practice because every time a state
has attempted to mend it, the death
penalty has become unconstitution-
al. Less than 2 percent of the crimi-
nals who commit the most shocking
of crimes are sentenced to the death
penalty. After the 2008 recession and
more stringent economic policies
with the federal deficit at the fore-
front of discussion, it's time to look at
this issue from a new angle.
The public is a finicky group
to understand, and especially the
American public. People are rarely
aware of when or why they change
their opinions on political issues
unless the change was derived from
a radical experience. In the case
of capital punishment, the radical
experiences are typically nation-
wide and are delivered to individu-
als by the media. If the key factor
to changing the public's attitude
stems from radical experience, then
it's possible that presenting radical
enough information would be able

to change public opinion and, in
turn, public policy. When a singu-
lar execution costs millions, and the
system in general generates a bill
to the tune of billions of state and
federal tax dollars, perhaps we've
reached "radical enough." Politi-
cians are seen as flippant if they
take a monumental policy, such as
capital punishment, and continually
change their stance.
Economics produces hard facts -
just as hard as scientific facts. So, if
radical enough economic facts were
disseminated amongst the public,
those may potentially sway the peo-
ple. Money affects all of us - people
have to pay taxes. That $308 million
being spent per execution in Cali-
fornia comes from state and federal
taxes. That means that every U.S.
citizen is directly affected. Most
people don't realize that a death
sentence is more expensive than
life without parole. The economics
of the death penalty may be radical
enough to change public opinion.
So what if people knew? What if
the general public suddenly became
aware of this completely counter-
intuitive fact? Would it have an
impact? It seems yes. National sup-
port for the death penalty tends
to be around 63 percent, and yet

Pimps of Joytime
to rock Blind Pig

Eclectic band to
mix funk, soul and
rock 'n' roll
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
There are few bands out
there that have a magical abil-
ity to walk into a venue in what-
ever part of
the world and The Pimps
simply play of .oytime
music that gets
feet moving. Thursday
The Pimps of at 9 p.m.
Joytime are
one of them. Blind Pig
Since 2005, $10
the group, led
by frontman
Brian J, has grown from playing
basement parties in Brooklyn to
playing over 100 shows per year,
including stops along the fes-
tival circuit at Bonnaroo, High
Sierra, Outside Lands and more.
Despite a grueling, seem-
ingly nonstop tour schedule, the
band - Brian, Chauncey Year-
wood, Mayteana Morales, Clark
Dark and Eric Bolivar - puts on
show after show of high-energy,
danceable and bone-shakingly
funky music.
"Most of the time, because
there's a lot of heavy grooves
going on, it turns into a dance
party," Brian explained in a
Skype interview from Costa
Rica, where the group is playing
a few shows before coming to
Ann Arbor on the 21st.
"I know when I go to see a
band, one of my favorite things
is if you can make me dance and
hit me with some cool melo-
dies and cool songs at the same
time. I just love that," Brian said.
"That's something I strive for -
not just to make it a dance party,
but we're also sneaking bits of
quality in there."
The origins of the band's
distinctive multi-genre sound,

Brian J said he likes to get the crowd on its feet at his shows

which includes elements of funk,
soul, rock and world music, were
part of Brian's childhood. His
father listened to a variety of
blues and soul music as well as
early 1960s and 1970s rock 'n'
roll. He grew and immersed
himself into funk, heavy rock
and, later, a variety of world
music from Latin America and
Africa.
This eclectic musical growth
was only further compounded in
the late 1990s and early 2000s,
when Brian and his future band-
mates were making music in New
York City. "(Brooklyn) just got to
be this ultra-hip place. In 1999 or
2000, it really started to be this
special place where you had kids
of different cultural backgrounds
all sort of mixing together," he
said. "And for me, that was really
cool. I had never experienced
that."
"In most places, the cultures
wouldn't mix together," Brian
added. "But (in Brooklyn) there
were those couple places where
everyone got together and par-
tied and got down to the same
DJ. That was special."
Given the band's frantic tour
schedule, recording can be
drawn out. The group laid down

Janxta Funk - a follow up to the
2008 debut, High Steppin' - on-
and-off over the course of the
year in Brian's own studio and
on the road.
The frequent touring hasn't
stopped Brian from thinking
ahead, however, and a third
record is taking shape.
"I have the feeling it will be
the fall by the time it comes out,
because we're really trying to do
this one right," he explained. "I'm
trying to make it the best album
yet," he added. "Just the most
powerful album we can do."
Ultimately, at a time when art-
ists appear increasingly focused
on commercial success, the
Pimps of Joytime concentrate on
one basic thing: music.
"My philosophy is I want to
make good music. Just the best
music I can make that I love,"
Brian said. "I really want to be
successful, but I'm not going to
sacrifice any integrity musically."
"To be aware of what's hap-
pening around you in the era
that you live in but to make
music that comes from your
heart, that is really a statement,
that is unique to you," he added,
pausing for a moment. "That's
what I'm doing."

. Beyonce's life uncovered in
all-new HBO documentary

By GIBSON JOHNS
OnlineArtsEditor
Between her slaying of the
National Anthem at the Inaugura-
tion, her rebuttal to haters at her
"Any Questions?" press confer-
ence and her bar-raising Super
Bowl halftime show performance,
Beyonce has been delightfully
unavoidable this year, and "Life
Is But A Dream" continues that
trend.
This self-produced HBO doc-
umentary - which combines
footage from at-home camcord-
ers, professional recordings and
Beyonce's intriguingly active
webcam - follows the star start-
ing with her decision to part ways
(professionally) with her father
and become her own manager as
she begins recording her fourth
studio album, 4.
From the film's opening min-
utes, then, Bey proves that for the
next hour and a half,nothing is off-
limits. We get immediate reactions
to her first pregnancy and subse-
quent unpublicized miscarriage.
We see home video footage of her
tearful toast at Jay's birthday cel-
ebration from 2006. And we even
get our first good look at daughter
Blue Ivy (who looks an awful lot
like Jay-Z, by the way).
Interspersed between these
intimate moments are clips from
her comeback concert in Atlan-
tic City, N.J. and an interview in
which she elaborates on all of the
topics above. As a whole, it serves
as a video collage of a two-year
period of her life during which a
myriad of ups and downs forced
her to reevaluate her career, gain
a greater appreciation for her
family and

"Zero Hour."
Ever since "Lost" proved
that science fiction, mythology
and conspiracy story-telling
could sell to mass audiences,
the networks have been franti-
cally searching for a show that
excites viewers in the same
way. There was the short-lived
"FlashForward" and the even
shorter "The River," both of
which were canceled within the
first season. "Zero Hour" tries
desperately to fill the void of
the powerhouse "Lost," break-
ing the one rule of television:
Never try to imitate one of the
greats.
To put it frankly, "Zero
Hour" is batshit crazy. Hank
Galliston (Anthony Edwards,
"ER") - the owner of Modern
Skeptic, a suspiciously success-
ful paranormal magazine - is
thrown into a decades-old con-
spiracy when that evil, white-
eyed guy abducts his wife Laila

Not so solid 'Gear'

Latest installment of
popular video game
lacks in content
By JULIAN AIDAN
Daily Arts Writer
It's about time someone capital-
zed on the distinct lack of sword-
wielding cyborg-on-cyborg action
in the gam-
ing industry. ,
Half-human,
half-robot mer- Metal Gear
cenaries are few Rising
and farbetween,
and fortunately Revengence
superstar pro- Playstation 3,
ducer Kojima 360 and PC
Productions
decided to fill KONAMI
that niche.
The newest
game in the "Metal Gear" series
focuses on cyborg sword-for-
hire Raiden as he tries to keep
an overzealous private military
company full of bloodthirsty half-
man half-machine warmongers
from igniting a new war in the
name of profit. Ignoring conven-
tional weaponry in favor of flashy
swordplay, "Revengeance" and its
frantic hack-and-slash gorefest are
in stark contrast with the series-
defining stealth focus.
Oscillating between high-speed
dashes and slow-motion eviscera-
tion, battles in "Revengeance"
require split-second decision-
making. Often outmatchedboth in
number and in size, Raiden finds

himself constantly flanked by roid-
raging bionic hitmen and their
massive mechanical allies. Once
weakened, an enemy can be cut
in half during a bullet time-esque
sequence that challenges players
to exploit enemies' soft spots and
subsequently reduce them to quiv-
ering piles of trash.
Set in varying locales world-
wide, players are greeted by stun-
ningly detailed environments
that are every bit as susceptible to
Raiden's blade as his foes. Every
clash is orchestrated by a sympho-
ny of metal-on-metal clangs and
the sounds of tearing sinew, high-
lighting the top-notch aesthetics
expected of a "Metal Gear" game.
While all this is great, and while
it's difficult to argue that half-
human, half-robot, ninja-sword
wielding mercenaries tearing
each other to pieces would consti-
tute anything other than top-tier
entertainment, "Revengeance"
falls short in a number of areas.
Raiden's "Ninja Run" trivializes
combat by automatically deflect-
ing oncoming bullets and, to a
lesser extent, exploration by allow-
ing him to avoid obstacles without
additional input from the player.
Even worse, the mechanic fails
intermittently, leading to frustrat-
ing deaths.
Saying that Raiden's sprinting
mechanic hinders exploration is a
bit of misnomer. The game is pain-
fully linear, with the series staple
of being able to approach a situ-
ation from multiple angles being
reduced to trying to determine
whether or not it'd be possible

to one-hit kill an enemy before
engaging the rest and environ-
ments offering few to no alternate
paths to advancement. Invisible
walls plague engagements, artifi-
cially confining the player within
their bounds.
The previously mentioned
slow-mo cutting apart of enemies
(think "VATS" from the "Fall-
out" series) isn't just a bonus - it's
the most efficient way of dealing
with enemies as well as the best
way to earn points (which allow
Raiden to buy upgrades). It's fun
as a novel tool for taking care of
frustrating baddies, but after the
200th time it starts to get a bit old.
The boss fights - against consis-
tently more difficult and chal-
lenging enemies - unfortunately
always boil down to a quicktime
sequence and slowed-down juli-
enning, slicing and dicing.
The other characters in the
game are almost as forgettable as
the combat. Various token allies
and foes make an appearance, with
overdone accents and some of the
worst writing this side of "Twi-
light." The hero and antagonists
alike are privy to terrible voice act-
ing and cheesy lines. Raiden espe-
cially stands out, sounding more
like a wimpy smoker from a 1950s
sitcom than a morally conflicted
killing machine.
While a fun and mindless foray
into the hack-and-slash genre with
top-notch aesthetics, "Reven-
geance" isn't to be pursued if
you're seeking varied gameplay,
interesting characters or remotely
decent scripting.

"Man, beaches are so last year."
Signature Beach Fossils

Several years ago, the greater
New York City area caught an
unbridled obsession with the
"beach." Surely

ticized sandy Cash the
getaways, from Tuth
the glamorous-
in-1950 Rocka- Beach Fossils
way Beach to Captured
the constantly
battling-for-
chieness Hamptons. But, for some
reason, 2009 encouraged every-
one in the city (the young adults,
specifically) to lavish the burning
August beach days of their fan-
tasized youth - the Beach Boy-
soundtracked and Snoball-dieted
years they were born 40 years too
late to ever actually experience.
The city was culturally bom-
barded, from trendy minimalist
surf shops in downtown Manhat-
tan (Saturdays Surf NYC, the surf
shop that no actual surfer has
ever been to) to suddenly cool ice
cream trucks offering the latest
gluten-free alternative to salted
caramel frozen yogurt (a food that
isn't healthy no matter how much

organic cream is used in it). Even
the area's music was affected by
this contagion: A sleepy New Jer-
sey band named Real Estate cre-
ated a beautiful, strummy, beach
opus in its self-titled debut. A
Florida band named Surfer Blood
crafted a not-as-good coastal
punk album named (unsurpris-
ingly) Astro Coast. And a single
man named Dustin Payseur,
going by the name Beach Fossils,
created (but did not release until
2010) another self-titled debut of
chordal beach-guitar elegance.
The supposed corniness of a fam-
ily beach vacation was cool again,
restored to its Americana glory
through the wonderful combi-
nation of modern irony and lo-fi
recording.
Fast forward four years, how-
ever, and the New York "surfer"
scene is quite different. Like any
other NYC trend, the illusion of
urban beachiness soon washed
away with the coming of new
iPhone editions and the dete-
rioration of the very bands that
helped make the scene what it
was (one of the members of Surfer
Blood was later arrested for beat-
ing his girlfriend in Florida). The
goody-goody strumming of vin-
tage coastal times wasn't so fresh

and happy anymore, and the
scene - along with the sounds of
it - evolved into the electronic-
infused mish-mash we now have
today. With the exception of
Beach Fossils, that is.
The band itself has grown and
changed with coming and going
members, but its overall beach-
influenced sound has remained
remarkably solid - as illustrated
in its latest commercial album,
Clash the Truth. The album
opens with the group's char-
acteristic swaying guitars, the
chords singing back and forth in
1980s-influenced oceanic harmo-
ny, mimicking the attitude of Pay-
seur when he croons "All of what
you said / It went right over my
head" - as if the supposed death
of surf rock never even happened.
Payseur
preserves
beach theme.
The entire album seems to
carry this beach-proud attitude,
from "Clash the Truth" all the
way to "Crashed Out" With
the exception of three tracks -
"Modern Holiday," "Brighter"
and "Ascension," each similarly
graceful in its heroin ambience
- the songs of the album follow
a similar heavy-chord to riding-
drum to skipping-guitar break-
down, often beginning subdued
and harmless only to rise into
severe instrument-filled climax.
They shift in tempo and feel
- "Generational Synthetic" is
proud and exuberant in classic
speedy-punk bassline, whereas
"Sleep Apnea" is laconic and
mesmerizing. But they all paint
some larger beachy picture,
from their squealing aquatic
guitar sounds to the muffled
singing of Payseur himself, as
if the Rockaway's sound system
has been clogged with sand par-
ticles on a melting July Sunday.
None of the tracks are bad,
per se, but they all begin to fade
together into one dragging gui-
tar strum by the fourth song (at
least). On an individual basis,
they're actually quite incred-
ible - a track like "Careless,"
edgy and abrasive but some-
how soothing in its chordality,
would stand out as perhaps one
of the deepest and most soni-
cally diverse singles this year.
However, it nearly gets lost in
the overtly beachy fervor that
is Clash the Truth. The album's
sound - what it stood for amid
the fall of the once-unstoppable
trend - gets slightly repetitive
with strummy-guitar climax
after strummy-guitar climax,
sort of like how the beach gets
tiring with sandcastle after
sandcastle in burning sun. Iron-
ic how that all works.
Nonetheless, Clash the Truth
is a very solid album. It stands
for the sound it delivers, and
stays behind it throughout its
near-45-minute entirety - for
better or for worse. Like the
fossils its name represents, the
group remains a relic of the
beach while nearby blood from
surfers drags away in white-

washed waves. Beach Fossils
doesn't seem to be changing any
time soon.

'M' can't find stroke

Michigan finishes
last in Puerto Rico
with disappointing
42 over par
ByJUSTIN MEYER
For The Daily
A trip down to the Puerto
Rico Classic in the middle of
February wasn't the quasi-
spring break the Michigan
men's golf team washoping for.
Instead, Michigan was mus-
cled into last place with a team
score of 42 over par by a field
that proved the freshman-lad-
en Wolverines still have much
work to do. The team sifted
through the rubble on Tuesday,
searching for bright spots amid
a performance that left every
Michigan golfer outside the top
half of the field.
"I thought a couple of the
guys were in pretty solid control
of their game," said coach Chris
Whitten. "The biggest thing is
that guys can come back and
practice based on what's hap-
pening in tournament play. We
all work on our fundamentals
all the time, but what we really
need to practice are the mis-
takes we make under pressure."
The Wolverines certainly
have their work cut out for
them. Michigan sent seniors
Matt Alessi and Miguel Echa-
varria, as well as freshmen
Chris O'Neill, Brett McIntosh

and Andrew Yeager, on the trip.
McIntosh continued an
impressive freshman cam-
paign, finishing tied for 39th,
but every other player's scores
came as a bit of a disappoint-
ment.
"Brett posted a very solid fin-
ish and knows that he had a lot
of opportunities to even shoot
lower," Whitten said.
McIntosh said he kept his
confidence up - even after a
few double-bogey missteps -
by remembering that he'd been
shooting well all weekend and
knowing that he needed a clear
mind to continue playing well.
It all came together for
McIntosh on the 15th hole -
his last of the shotgun-style
tournament - when he made a
25-foot shot for an eagle and par
onthe day..
Despite the poor perfor-
mance on the team leaderboard,
the Wolverines feel like they
have the ability to post better
scores, and a respectable first
round seems to be indicative
of that. Michigan was flirting
with a par performance before
a series of stumbles on the last
two holes dropped it to 12th
out of the 15 teams. The first
day left the team frustrated but
excited for the next round and a
chance to improve its position.
"I think we got it out of our
system. ... we could move up a
lot," O'Neill said after the first
round. "We're so close to really
clicking."
Instead, day two sank the

Wolverines for good. The team
posted a 313 for the round,
which, at 25 over par, was
almost enough to guarantee it
last place.
One area Michigan could
look to for encouragement
after the tournament was the
more-impressive third round.
McIntosh and O'Neill shot par
for their best scores of the tour-
nament, and the team posted a
relatively successful seven over
par.
In the end, however, the
southern schools proved far
superior to the competition
from the Big Ten. No. 5 Ala-
bama won the tournament with
a score of 33 under par and
Northwestern was the only Big
Ten school not to finish in the
bottom three.
"We come (to the Puerto Rico
Classic) because the field is
really, really strong every year,"
Whitten said, "I think the guys
know that there's work to be
done. This is a really competi-
tive field we just played, but it's
not at all where we wanted to
finish."
Michigan's next tournament
is the Colleton River Collegiate
in South Carolina on March
6, which gives the team a few
weeks that Whitten noted are
crucial. When spring break
rolls around and most of cam-
pus empties, the team will be
on the range trying to make
sure it doesn't replicate what
happened on the ocean course
this weekend.

Senior guard Jenny Ryan was named Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday for the first time in her Michigan career.

Three straight wins
have propelled
Wolverines to third
place in Big Ten
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team is the hottest in the
Big Ten.
Winners of three straight,
including a road victory over
then-No. 13 Purdue for the first
time since 1998 and a win over
Michigan State for the first time
in five years, the Wolverines are
playing their best basketball
of the season. Actually, they're
playing some of their best bas-
ketball ever.
And it couldn't have come at a
better time.
With four conference games
remaining, Michigan (8-4 Big
Ten, 19-6 overall) is in the home
stretch of its Big Ten season, and
it's heating up again just in time
for the NCAA Tournament. Last
year, the Wolverines had to cross
their fingers and pray they'd
be selected to join the dance in
March, but if the season were to
end today, they'd be a lock - no
praying necessary.
Currently, Michigan sits tied
for third place in the Big Ten.
The Wolverines have the same

conference record as Purdue and
Illinois, but they recently beat
both teams during their three-
game win streak.
RYAN LEADS THE PACK:
Leading the way during Michi-
gan's hot streak is senior guard
Jenny Ryan, who was named Big
Ten Player of the Week on Mon-
day - the first time in her career
that she's won the honor.
"Jenny is a really emotional
kid, and I was worried about
her (before the Michigan State
game)," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "I kept telling
her to relax, but I also told her
before the game she was going to
have to score, and golly, she did."
Against the Spartans on Sat-
urday, Ryan had a career-best 24
points on 7-for-16 shooting, while
also adding eight rebounds, five
assists and -four steals. Most
importantly, Ryan hit four free
throws in the final 17 seconds to
seal the win. +
For Ryan, however, the stat
that stoodabove the rest was her
zero turnovers. The guard aver-
ages 2.9 turnovers per game.
"That's unusual for me," Ryan
said. "People were setting good
screens, coach Barnes Arico
really came up with a great game
plan to find me on comfortable
spots on the floor and passes that
were comfortable for me."
Ryan has been the leader of
this team from day one, and now
it's showing on the stat sheet.

"I've coached a lot of really
good point guards in my career
as a coach and she leads the pack
just because of everything she
does," Barnes Arico said.
BRUTAL FINAL STRETCH:
The Wolverines have entered
the home stretch of their brutal
conference schedule. Michigan
is within striking distance of the
top Big Ten spot, and it plays the
top two teams in the Big Ten in
the next five days.
First up, at home on Thursday,
is No. 24 Nebraska (9-3, 19-6),
which sits in second place in the
conference, followed by a visit to
No. 7 Penn State (11-1, 21-3) on
Sunday.
The Wolverines lost to the
Lady Lions earlier this season in
a close 59-49 matchup at Crisler
Center.
The loss to Penn State was
the beginning of a slump during
which Michigan lost four of five,
which nearly kicked it out of Big
Ten title contention.
After those two tough games,
the Wolverines play their final
home game against Northwest-
ern on Feb. 28, before ending on
the road against Ohio State on
March 3.
If Michigan can come away
with a victory against one of its
two remaining ranked oppo-
nents, the Wolverines will set
themselves up for a serious run
at the Big Ten title before head-
ing into the madness of March.

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Editor
As of Wednesday, senior for-
ward Kevin Lynch has appeared
in 158 games for the Michigan
hockey team.
How many has he missed?
Two.
He sat out the Wolverines' first
series last year against Bentley
because of back spasms. He said
that he'd been struggling with
back spasms for the entirety of
the preseason, and the pain was
to the point where he knew his
back wouldn't recover if he didn't
take any games off.
Though senior forward A.J.
Treais has littered the stat sheet
more than Lynch the past two
years, he hasn't matched Lynch's
stability and consistency over
the four-year period. The youth-
ful struggles that affect most
freshmen transitioning to col-
lege hockey, the injuries that are
constantly a problem in a physi-
cal, grueling sport like hockey
or even the rare one-game sus-
pension that can result from a
game misconduct never resulted

Lync
in Lynch regularly watching the
game from the stands.
It's neither his goal-scoring
prowess nor his good fortune to
avoid bad injuries that have sepa-
rated Lynch from his classmates.
Berenson attributes Lynch's suc-
cess to his hard work, physical
play and bigbody.
"I think he's a mentally tough
kid and he's mature physically,"
he said. "He's one of our stronger
kids, too, so he not only plays and
has been a bit of an iron man, but
he's strong."
How lucky has Lynch been in
avoiding a serious injury? This
season, for example, four of the
seven Michigan defensemen have
missed multiple games due to an
injury. That number might be
higher than average, but it shows
how difficult it can be during the
long college hockey season - the
Wolverines' first exhibition game
against Windsor came on Oct.
9 and their last regular-season
game will be played on March 2
- to stay healthy.
And Berenson, who not only
played three seasons at Michigan
but also went onto have a20-year

NHL career, relates to t
and tribulations these
face every day of the sea
"When you're a hocke

currently ranks last in the CCHA
in goals allowed per game, and
third worst in the NCAA.
And it's not that Lynch is
physical to the point of being
too aggressive. Though he ranks
second on the team in penalty
minutes with 34, he has just four
more than senior defenseman
Lee Moffie and 36 fewer than
freshman defenseman Jacob
Trouba. Not only does Lynch's
physicality force turnovers and
give Michigan a necessary pres-
ence deep in the other team's
zone, but it also helps him create
offensively.
"When he's on, all he has to do
is hit guys," said junior defense-
man Mac Bennett. "If he hits
guys, people give him more space,
and if you get that space, he's able
to make plays. He doesn't put
himself in a position to get hit
awkwardly, and I think that kind
of attributes to him always being
in a position where he can hit you
instead of you hitting him."
And Lynch didn't become the
physical player that he is today
overnight. He says that his physi-
cal mindset came from when he

was a freshman, struggling to
find the back of the net. Instead
of just working o'n honing his
offensive skills, he worked on
other intangibles that a good for-
ward should have - transform-
ing into the physical player that
bangs bodies every night.
Even after Lynch upped his
physicality, offensive production
didn't always come effortlessly.
- or at all. His freshman cam-
paign endured a 13-game point-
less streak, and a year later he
experienced an even more bru-
tal 18-game pointless streak. But
during this time, his physical-
ity and defensive presence were
constants. It's these attributes,
not his line on the stat sheet, that
have made him the consistent
player Berenson has seen for so
long.
"Lynch has gone through some
slumps of all slumps," Beren-
son said. "But I can tell you that
he never gave up and never quit
working. He never quit check-
ing, never quit hitting so you still
wanted him in the lineup even
though he might not have been at
his best."


Before arriving at Michigan,
Lynch played two seasons with
the National Team Development
Program in Ann Arbor where he
was one of the best goal scorers
- he compiled 24 goals and 24
assists for a total of 48 points in
63 games during his last year.
Lynch's consistency and pro-
ductivity for the U-18 team was

It's this physicality that has
made Lynch a regular name on
the Michigan line chart over the
years. Listed at 6-foot-1 and 210
pounds, he uses his big body to
play a physical type of hockey.
Especially this year, his physical
presence has been something of

Beilein hopes week off will do wonders for Michigan

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
Beginning with a Jan. 24 win
>aver Purdue and culminating
With an embarrassing road loss
toMichigan State on Feb. 12, the
Michigan men's basketball team
flayed a stretch of seven games in
20 days..
The Wolverines won the first
three games comfortably, but lost
hree of the final four contests. By
- The time the gantlet had ended,
they'd played four road games,
four teams in the current Top-25
-poll (includingtwo of the nation's
top;four teams), and two over-
times but held just one practice
that wasn't devoted to a specific-
ame preparation in the three
week period.
After a few days to get over the
loss to the Spartans and prepare
for Sunday's win over Penn State,

Michigan now finds itself at the
beginning of a 20-day stretch with
just four games before the regu-
lar-season finale at home against
No.1 Indiana.
Michigan coach John Beilein,
who said after Tuesday's loss in
East Lansing that the time off will
be a "great time to get back to the
basics that we were doing earlier
in the year," was relieved to finally
be done with the toughest portion
of the schedule.
Beilein gave his players Mon-
day off in hopes they'd come back
fresh on Tuesday. The Wolverines
don't have a game until Illinois
visits Ann Arbor on Sunday.
"We don't usually take (a day
off) the day after a game," Beilein
said Sunday. "We like to watch the
film, video, and take the following
day off, but the way I looked at it
during this week is get healthy

Tuesday and Wednesday andhave
another day off Thursday for most.
of our guys. That way we get guys
two days of rest this week."
The regular wear and tear of a
season can slow down anyone -
perhaps an explanation for why,
Penn State was able to score 10
points more than its season aver-
age on Sunday - but. the Wol-
verines are facing more pressing
injury issues. Redshirt junior for-
ward Jordan Morgan has been
severelylimitedbyan ankle sprain
he suffered on Jan. 27 at Illinois.
Since then, he's missed two games
and has yet to play double-digit
minutes in the other four contests.
"We had no idea that Jordan
Morgan would take this long,"
Beilein said. "He wants to play,
he's insisting on playing, he's
insisting on coming to practice, so
you've got to trust him. But when
you watch him move outthere, it's
not happening. He's delayed.
"He's rehabbing all day long....
He's very slow. Until he gets bet-
ter, that really affects us."
Freshman guard Caris LeVert
is also dealing with a sprained
ankle sustained on Sunday, pro-
viding more evidence that this
time off couldn't have come at a
better time for the Wolverines.
But even ' with the injuries,
Michigan has several issues to
correct, mainly on defense. The
Wolverines allow an average of
61.4 points per game, but they
have given up 70-plus points in
five of their last seven games.
Some of that has to do with the
nature of the opponent, but Michi-
gan's defense has also committed
numerous defensive breakdowns,

such as slow rotations or failure
to box out, which Beilein hopes he
can correct in practice.
"We're going to get back and
guard some people, play defense,"
Beilein said of this week's plans.
With the postseason less
than a month away, this week
off is crucial for Michigan to get
back ontrack. But with so many
young, inexperienced players,

Beilein cautioned of the difficul- teachers, but there were some

ties between allowing for slower
learning curves and trying to get
his messages to stick.
"It's a sweet spot that we real-
ly have to be very careful with,"
Beilein said. "If this is the 80th
practice and you're still not talk-
ing on defense, then you have to
get after them.
"We pride ourselves on being

moments these last couple weeks
that we just say, 'Enough is
enough. We're going to do this
because you won't do that' It's
that area where you don't want to
get them to where they lose their
confidence, but at the same time,
gettingtougher right now through
all these things is important for
us."

An ode to LBJ
by Josephine Adams

On fine COmnt what's wrong with students today?
"Of course, what isn't mentioned here is the corruption of our
for-maximum-profit businesses, who grab fresh-out-of-college
grads, burn them up for 5-10 years, then spit them out, exhausted
and unable to carry on so they can hire another college grad at half
the salary and repeat the process."
- USER: Jaym Esch

paige's pages: revisions, revisions by paige pearcy

Having admittedly failed at
reading the one book I promised
myself I would read for the first
of these columns - Zadie Smith's
"White Teeth" - I was deter-
mined to read it for this one. I'm
thankful that I tackled it, though
tackle is a strong word because it
was hardly unwieldy or difficult.
It was more of a pleasurable hug.
I chose to read Smith's first
novel for two reasons: One,
because I admire the essays and
literary journalism that I've
already read by her and two,
because I was told that she
always revises her work, even
during public readings. And
considering I re-wrote this
column five times and have
been editing it for two weeks,
that sounded all too familiar.
How does she know when
something is good enough to
publish it? When does she
make that distinction? And
when can we accept we've
done something well enough
to say it is "well enough?"
When do we give up on
the pursuit of perfection to
settle for something we deem
acceptable? Perhaps Smith
found it in "White Teeth"
when she wrote my favorite
line from the book: "Pulchritude
- beauty where you would least
suspect it, hidden in aword that
looked like it should signify a
belch or a skin infection."
Perhaps I found it when I was
accepted to attend to this fine
institution, or when I was in
fourth grade and won an essay
contest about conserving electric-
ity (with the impressive monetary
prize of $1.) Maybe that's when
I decided I did something well
enough. But that doesn't mean I
wouldn't have been completely on
board to go back and make revi-

sions. There is always room for
revisions, something that is hum-
bling and scary but also strangely
calming; we can always scratch
out words to make a sentence be
more visceral, just like we can
always turn back around and talk
to that crush and say what we
actually mean. We can always
change something we don't like.
Having that ability to never settle
but still determine when some-
thing is "good enough for the time

~ t
V
being" keeps us going.
Yet, when I read Smith's book,
I couldn't find any areas where
it needed revising - not that I
have an authority to say. It was
exceptional. The words are so
perfectly selected that sentences
like this: "But surely to tell these
tales and others like them would
be to speed the myth, the wicked
lie, that the past is always tense
and the future, perfect," come up
and you just have to stop for a
minute and breathe because, yes,
this book is something great. And
that's where Smith excels. She can

hide the flaws. Hide the areas that
she would revise. That's a skill
harder to do than one may expect.
How do you say something is your
best when you know it's not? It's
the decision you have to make
at that moment when you run
out of time and you have to do
something. Even if it's not quite
what you want, you still have
to go with it. You have to meld
the good and the bad so well
that the average onlooker can't
distinguish a difference - or
else you're screwed. You'll
constantly be faced with
disappointment and dissatis-
faction that is impossible to
fix. That act of being so good
(but not perfect) at covering
up your imperfections, and
accepting where you wish you
could revise but you just can't,
yields contentment. Smith
had to decide she was content
enough with the published
"White Teeth." And so is the
reader.
Likewise in "White Teeth,"
the characters are seeking
contentment. Clara wants a
'normal' family, but how can
she get that when she marries
a 40-year-old man when she's
17? And he wants a normal
life but is plagued with memories
of war. Samad works to find true
love, but grapples with it because
it requires him to go against his
religion. So instead the charac-
ters hide. Sound familiar? They
keep on searching for the life they
want, oh yes, but they also keep
living their same lives. They keep
their eyes open for the moment
when it's acceptable to change, to
revise, but until then they cover
up.
But it's never to late to make
that correction. Revisions, revi-
sions.

J'm in love with my car. That sounds weird, I
know, but it's true.Ask anyone.
Ask my sister, who gave me the car as a
hand-me-down six years ago; ask my friends
from home, who love the fact that I volunteer to
be designated driver; ask my mechanic, who has
told me multiple times that the car is shit and
should probably be given to Cash for Clunkers
as soon as possible. They'll all agree - I'm in love
with my car.
I learned to drive in a Dodge Caravan. Sexy,
I know. You don't need to tell me. At the time
- when I was 15 - I liked to say "jank." Why? I
don't know, but I thought I was cool and "jank"
was cool, so everything was cool. So my friends
and I named this Dodge Caravan "Whip Jank."
You can mock me all you want - if you're reading
this online the comment boxes are down below
- but I drove around in a car named Whip Jank.
And then ...he died. Myfamilyhas a habitofpay-
ing for cars that are bound to be worthless in less
than five years. Anyway, moral of the story: I got
LBJ.
LBJ, you ask? Like the president? Well, per-
haps. The Honda Civicwassmaller than the van,
so he immediately became "Lii Whip Jank,"
which became "LWJ," which became "Lil Wil-
liam James," which became "Lii Billy James,"
whichbecame "LBJ." Some people call him Lyn-
don B. Johnson, but that just doesn't flow off the
tongueaswell. So, LBJ itis.
If I'm being honest, which I'm normally not,
it's a pretty crappy car. It's a 1994 Honda Civic.

It's black, the "Check engine" light has been on
for three years and the "Maintenance required"
light has been on for four. It failed the emissions
inspection required in Washington, D.C. two
years in a row, so now we just pay the fine. The
windshield wipers somehow manage to smear
rain across the glassso it's actually harder to see,
and when it's cold enough - which it always is
in Michigan - the driver's side window doesn't
roll down. The trunk isjammed and hardly ever
opens, especially when you're running late for
the airport and need somewhere to putyour bag.
The two back doors make dying-animal sounds
whenever they open and close. If you're easily
embarrassed, you probably don't want to get out
of my car in a crowded parking lot because peo-
ple are undoubtedly going to stare.
You're confused - I get it. How could I possi-
bly love a car that is in worse shape than Subway's
Jared before six-inch Veggie Delights came into
his life? The answer isdivided into three parts.
One
I like to tell people that I peaked in high
school. That at 17, I was the coolest I was ever
going to be. And while that's not necessarily
true - nobody is as cool as they think they are
at 17, and I am no exception - I'm still a sucker
for reliving the glory days. That car is count-
less road trips to Nantucket and the Eastern
Shore. It's 2009, appalling top-40 hits, mid-
night drives to 7-Eleven to buy eigarottes for

friends who weren't yet18. It's Trident Tropical
Twist, Febreze and Diet Coke. It's sneaking off
campus during fifth period to go to Chipotle.
It's following the bus to lacrosse games in the
boondocks of Maryland. And I get to relive all
of these moments every time I turn the key.
Two
I've been taking my car to school since the
beginning of my sophomore year. The drive
from D.C. to Ann Arbor takes me about seven
and a half hours, and I love every minute of it.
First of all, I love being alone. That makes me
sound extremely antisocial. I swear I have
friends. Really, I do.
Second of all, the speed limit on the Ohio
Turnpike is 70. 70! So really that's 80, and, if
you're feeling really brave, it's 90. Cops are
somewhat of a downer, but I've managed to
avoid them so far. And I definitely just jinxed
myself with that lastasentence.
Third, you can't do anything but drive when
you drive. That sounded better in my head, but
what I'm trying to say is that you're completely
free from everything. All you've got to do is
drive. I promise, there's really nothing better
than the Pennsylvania Turnpike at three in the
afternoon on a Sunday in August.
Three
And then there are the little things, like the

way the steering wheel is in just the right place
so I can drive with my knee (although everyone
else hates it because they thinkI'm going to kill
them), or the tiny compartment by the dash-
board that fits an unfinished pack of gum per-
fectly, or the slight stick of the gas pedal when
you jump above 30 mph.
In the end, it all comes down to familiarity.
My friends tell me I'm scared of change, and,
in a lot of ways, they're right. I just had to cus-
tom-order a pair of shoes because they stopped,
making the style I've been wearing since high
school, and I just couldn't bring myself to
branch out and buy something different. So
maybe I'mjust overly attached to a piece of crap
because I've had it for so long. But I'm okay with
that.
One of these days, I want to go through all
the repair receipts from the last few years and
add up the money my parents have spent on
keeping my car alive. I probably could have
purchased a not-piece-of-shit used car with the
money spent on repairs in the past six years.
Actually, I probably could have purchased
an Audi. Or a Ferrari. Or one of those Justin-
Bieber-customized batmobiles. But I'm in love
with my car. So, if you need a ride - and you
don't mind squeaking doors, funky windshield
wipers and driving 20 mph above the speed
limit -call me.

he University, launched a now-sus-
pcn ed Orphan Works Project that aimed
to make works with unknown rights hold-
ers available. Aiken pointed out that many
works that the University determined to be
orphaned had living authors or were still in
print.
"This is interference with the authors'
commercial rights. It's not the job of a uni-
versity to make the decisions about these
rights," Aiken said.
Courant affirmed that the initial process
of orphan-work identification was flawed,
and the project was suspended.
"No orphan works -not one - were made
available to readers in error," Courant said.
"However, it's now clear that reliable iden-
tification of orphan works is difficult and
costly."
U.S. law dictates that 70 years after the
author's death or if the rights are otherwise
waived, the work enters public domain.
Two-thirds of HathiTrust's contents are not
accessible for full reading for this reason, as
these works retain copyright and cannot be

freely distributed. In the HathiTrust, public
domain works are fully viewable, a practice
Aiken affirms as legal and approved by writ-
ers.
Works that still retain copyright, how-
ever, may be searched, and users can see the
pages where their keyword exists.
Google Books often provides a "snippet"
of text to show the keyword in context of the
searche,s. Both providers show the book title,
author's name and other basic information
about the text.
Hasbrouck said this prevents readers
from using the book itself. For instance, an
author may offer the book on his or her ad-
supported website that readers could use,
and the author would get money from ad
revenue on the website.
With HathiTrust, this is money lost.
Google's "snippet" technique is even more
undermining.
"Looking at the index does substitute
for looking at the book itself," Hasbrouck
said. "There's been an attempt to portray it
as something'that has no economic corise-

quence for authors at all."
Only individuals who are scanning books
to develop the archive can read the copy-
righted books in full.
Laine Farley, executive director of the
California Digital Library, said HathiTrust
is spawningnew academic studies even with
books that aren't fully accessible.
"We're already seeing evidence of new
types of scholarship that can come out
of access to these works," Farely said. "If
they're not (readable), just knowing that
they exist has increased the ability of our
scholars as well as the public to find those
materials."
Twenty-first century enlightenment
While authors, publishers and the enti-
ties who seek to publicize their work slog
through legal disputes, technology surges
ahead.
"I sometimes say that, every once in a
while, this University stumbles across some-
thin'g that' changes the world," Duderstadt

said. "This is one of those world-changing
things."
Duderstadt hailed HathiTrust, along with
massive open online courses, as a factor in
the current "21st century Enlightenment."
"Now if you have a cell phone, you not
only have access to millions and millions of
volumes of books' knowledge, but you have
access to learning capability for free," Dud-
erstadt said. "We're providing access, not
only to knowledge, but to learning for the
world."
Duderstadt recalled a friend, who recent-
ly relocated to China, having his furniture
moved in his new country when one of the
movers approached him.
"You know, I'm taking a course in com-
puter programming from MIT," the mover
said. "It's pretty hard."
Duderstadt's friend replied, "Well, why
are you moving furniture if you're taking
this course?"
"Well, five years from now I don't wanna
be a furniture mover," he replied. "I wanna
be a computer programmer."

JIM Wensa.Fbur 2001 / -TeStte en-

Wednesday, February 20 , 2013 // The Statement B

ean of Libraries Paul Courant tossed an
academic journal on a table in his office.
The earwax-colored front cover read:
The National Tax Journal, March 1980.
"Read that for as long as you can before you
get bored," Courant, a silver-haired man with a
tiny earring in his left ear said, smiling.
Like most writing published in the past 100
years, the journal was printed on acid paper,
which quickly deteriorates. Its pages are already
yellow around the edges.
Courant said these pages will have the consis-
tency of corn flakes in 50 years. The knowledge
it holds, too, could evaporate like soggy cereal -
and so could countless other tomes.
And that's just one problem HathiTrust tries
to eliminate. The HathiTrust Digital Library, a
four-year-old initiative led by the University and
involving over 60 other research libraries, seeks
to digitize the record of human knowledge.
A hathi never forgets
The University was part of HathiTrust's
small founding group, according to Courant,
who is also a professor of economics and pub-
lic policy and a member of HathiTrust's Board
of Governors. It is the world's largest digitized
library collection with more than 10 million cur-
rent volumes, 3.7 trillion pages and 8,467 tons of
knowledge; Google Books, a wing of
the online giant founded in 2004,
digitized most of it.
President Emeritus James
Duderstadt - current director
of the University's Millennium
Project and the Program in Sci-
ence, Technology and Public Policy
- has watched digitization become part
of the University's culture since his tenure
as president from 1988 to 1996. Two projects in
the early 1990s, with the National Science Foun-
dation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
pioneered the concept.
Engineering alum Larry Page worked with
the University on the NSF project in 1994 and
1995. In 2004, Page, now the CEO of Google,
approached the University, offering to digitize
its collections. Google would shoulder the costs,
and no books would be destroyed in the process
- then a major advancement in the business of
digitization.
Google Books has more than 20 million vol-
umes, according to Duderstadt, and they aim for
30 million. Nearly five million are from the Uni-
versity's libraries.
After working with Google, the University
collaborated with 26 other research universi-
ties to combine their individual digital collec-
tions in one venue, creating HathiTrust in 2008.
"Hathi" is the Hindi word for elephant, a gentle

giant famed for its impressive memory. Google
digitized the work for universities involved in
HathiTrust, and both the libraries and Google
own a copy.
"Throughout most of human history we have
rationed access to knowledge," Duderstadt said.
"But now it all comes to you. And in a world
where knowledge is the ultimate power, we've
kind of redefined how the world works."
However, HathiTrust and Google Books have
raised intricate legal questions. These orga-
nizations do not ask the permission of authors
or publishers before digitizing their books, nor
do they compensate either party. Paul Aiken,
Authors Guild Executive Director, and others
aren't happy with this interpretation of copy-
right law.
"There are tens of thousands of out-of-print
books that are becoming available again," Aiken
said. "These are still literary works under copy-
right, the result of thousands of hours of hard
work, and they're entitled to copyright protec
tion."
Legal strife
The Authors Guild filed a federal copyright
infringement suit in September 2011 against
HathiTrust. In October 2012, Federal District
Court Judge Harold Baer ruled against AG,
which is currently devising an appeal. Baer
wrote in his ruling that digitization was a trans-
formative act, or one that does not infringe upon
copyright.
"I cannot imagine a definition of fair use that
would ... terminate this invaluable contribution
to the progress of science and cultivation of the
arts " Baer wrote in the decision. He defined "fair
use" as copyrighted material that benefits the
public in "scholarship, teaching and research."
HathiTrust also allows readers to view books
in large print or listen via text-to-voice technol-
ogies, which Baer championed as an expansion
of options for print-disabled readers.
In Aiken's opinion, copyright law does allow
libraries to duplicate and digitize work for pres-
ervation reasons, but on a book-by-book basis
rather than complete collections. Aiken said
nothing states that a company, like Google, may
keep a copy of the work as well.
"It's not about going from one end of the
stacks to the other," Aiken said. "The digital
copy is supposed to stay with the library."
. Law Prof. Jessica Litman - author of "Digital
Copyright" - said that before digitizing, Google
announced they would be undertaking the pro-
cedure and anyone who did not want their works
digitized could opt out. The process of asking
each author for permission would have been
immense.
Litman said HathiTrust is a sort of project

that copyright should not and does not illegal-
ize.
"It seems to me that it was a very clear fair
use argument," Litman said. "The only thing I
can speculate about is that the authors felt so
strongly that the existence of a digitized copy
was a dignitary wrong."
In Litman's view, the authors were inaccu-
rate about this interpretation of the law, adding
that organizations do not need to ask permission
when digitizing a work.
Aiken argues that digitization is a duplication
of work, which necessitates the copyright hold-
er's consent. Without this, some writers don't
profit from their work.
Edward Hasbrouck, co-chair of the Book
Division in National Writer's Union, said many
authors support the creation of a digital copy of
their writings. But the fact that they cannot give
their permission is unlawful.
"If you have read many of the legal cases,
Google Books and HathiTrust have tried to cre-
ate an entirely false impression that authors
oppose the scanning of the books and want to
oppose digitization," he said "We very strongly
endorse and support digital libraries."
Many authors don't agree with Google and
HathiTrust bypassing them when digitizing
works, which he feels denies authors and pub-
lishers their fair compensation.
"It's profoundly disingenuous for Google to
claim a benign public purpose in its efforts,"
Hasbrouck said. "They are investing lots of
money in this project because they can make lots
of money in this purpose."
According to Courant, however, most of the
works in HathiTrust lack profit possibilities.
"Most ofthe books in the HathiTrust are long,
long out of print," Courant said. "Nobody's been
making any money to speak of in a long time.
There really isn't much of an income stream at
risk here."
While both Google Books and HathiTrust
will take down works if asked, Hasbrouck said
this is problematic. For instance, an academic
author with hundreds of works would have to
demand each work be removed. It may be an
endless battle if projects like Google Books goes
international.
The HathiTrust case is an echo of a previ-
ous class action suit filed in 2005 by the AG and
the Association of American Publishers against
Google Books.
The agreement reached involved a retail

product of Google's digitized works, Courant
said, where 37 percent of profits went to Google
and the rest to the right holders. The product
required that readers would pay to read online
works and those readers affiliated with certain
research institutions could access works for
free.
The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the settle-
ment in 2008 on the basis that too many people
- holders of books not inAG or AAP - were not
represented, adding settlement ought to rep-
resent the opinions of all people who would be
affected by it.
Hasbrouck said the settlement tapped into
the question of whether the author or publisher
holds electronic rights.
Google and AAP have since settled out of
court, while Google and AG are still at odds.
Google declined to comment due to ongoing liti-
gation.
Aiken stressed that this settlement would
have allowed AG to distribute their work to
libraries and students in an equitable way.
"It (mass digitization) should be done by con-
tractual agreements," Aiken said. "It should be
done so the value of the books are recognized by
the owners of the works."
Pamela Samuelson, director of the Berkeley
Center for Law and Technology, said the 2012
ruling in favor of HathiTrust improves the out-
looks for Google's litigation.
"The underlying issue of fair use is pretty
similar, so I would think that if the HathiTrust
victory is affirmed by the Second Circuit Court
- good news for Google," Samuelson said.
Who holds the rights?
Even once it's decided if the -?
consent of right holders - who-
ever can license a work for certain
uses, often the author or publisher
- is needed for digitization, two little
words destroythe concordance: orphan
works. These are works that have no
owner because the publisher is out of
business, the author is deceased or there
are other complications.
Samuelson said these works might be digi-
tized after "due diligence" has been served to
find thecopyright holders.
That may involve researching the author, the
publisher, the relatives of the author and so on,
but the legal term is subjective.
