Traditional college housing
- the rickety, aging homes and
rarely renovated apartments that
smell like Ramen noodles - has
had competitors from new luxury
apartment buildings near cam-
pus.
Landmark Apartments, Ster-
ling 411 Lofts, Zaragon Place and
Zaragon West have all opened in
the past five years, and several
new luxury apartment complexes
are on the rise.
Maggie Ladd, executive direc-
tor of the South University Area
Association, said prior to 2006,
the association researched retail
business and housing that was
offered to students at different
universities. Ann Arbor's offer-

filling the demand,"Ladd said,
Landmark is one complex
erected to meet some of those
demands. Its amenities are abun-
dant; a hot tub, sauna, free bagel
breakfasts, a built-in fitness cen-
ter, granite kitchen countertops
and more.
The catch: monthly rent in
some units can exceed $2,000 per
person.
"We have a very sophisticated
student body," Ladd said. "They
are looking for state-of-the-art
places to live as opposed to sin-
gle-family places that have been
turned into student apartments."
Other universities seem to be
attracting this "sophisticated"
populace as well. Newspapers
nationwide are commenting on
the new amenities colleges and
their surrounding towns are
offering, matching their higher-
income student body.
Rick Perlman, founder and
president of Zaragon, Inc., said

Celebrating and protecting
the planet has been promoted
by the University for years, but
Wednesday, Planet Blue injected

new energy into the spirit of sus-
tainabilitywith its annual Earth-
Fest - a "Party for the Planet"
that included food samples, live
entertainment and the chance to
win an iPad.
Music could be heard from
beyond the Diag, where about 60
booths weresetuptoeducatepass-
ersby about topics ranging from
how to make environmentally
friendly food purchases to guide-
lines for proper drug disposal.

To meet sustainability goals,
the University promotes creating
healthy environment, climate
action, community awareness
and waste prevention. Barbara
Hagan, a sustainability repre-
sentative with the Office of Cam-
pus Sustainability, said student
groups, individual University
units and outside nonprofit orga-
nizations had all come together
for the sake of sustainability and
to raise awareness at EarthFest.

"The University has goals to
reduce our waste, to increase
our sustainable food purchases,
to reduce the chemicals that we
put on the lawns," Hagan said.
"So all this is to bring awareness
to that initiative as well as all the
cool things we have on campus
that are working towards those
goals."

DETROIT
Pilot program
uses texting for
data collection

Researchers
survey Detroiters
through real-time
communication
By NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily StaffReporter
Though texting is generally
used as a casual form of com-
munication, University research-
ers are exploring the medium as
a new means of collecting data
and interacting with communi-
ties. Their pilot participants: low-
income Detroit residents.
Dr. Tammy Chang, assistant
professor of family medicine at
the Medical School, and mem-
ber of the Institute for Health-
care Policy and Innovation, is
leading a team of researchers for
the pilot. The goal is to collect
data on subjects' medical knowl-
edge, literacy and numeracy. The
study focuses on the residents of
the Villages at Parkside, a low-
income predominantly African-
American community in Detroit,
Chang said texting is differ-

ent from other forms of collect-
ing information, such as online
or physical surveys and phone
interviews, because it allows
researchers to receive real-time
information from the group they
are trying to learn more about.
She also said cell phone owner-
ship and use has been found to be
particularly high within African-
American communities, making
it easy to focus the sampling to
that demographic.
"You're not necessarily going
to go to a community meeting
after working two jobs," Chang
said. "You're not necessarily
going to feel like filling out a five-
page survey and when somebody
calls you on the phone, you may
not necessarily feel like talking
to them about your opinion about
x, y, z things. What's awesome
about text messaging for this
group is that it's allowing them
to speak to us in a language, in
a modality that they're used to.
They can do it on their time when
they feel like it."

tor of Friends of Parkside, a Detroit
nonprofit that focuses on the well-

By EMMAKERR
Daily StaffReporter
Wednesday evening, attendees
at the Ford School of Public Policy
got an expert's take on violence
in Colombia and its government's
inability to keep the peace.
Alejandro Castillejo-Cuellar,
associate professor and chair of
the Department of Anthropology
at the Universidad de los Andes in
Colombia, stressed the need for
leadership and new government
strategies for understanding the
country's political conflict and its
effect on Colombian communi-
ties.
Castillejo-Cuellar emphasized
both the potential and shortcom-
ings of Colombia's controver-
sial 2005 Justice and Peace Law,
which provides a path for former
paramilitary antigovernment
fighters to reintegrate into main-
stream society.

Document's
birthday marked
with discussion of
longevity, progress
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
To honor the 227th anniver-
sary of the U.S. Constitution's
signing, Adam Liptak, U.S.
Supreme Court correspondent
for The New York Times, spoke
Wednesday afternoon about

the Roberts court and the Con-
stitution's role in public policy
today.
In front of a crowd of about
100 people, consisting mostly
of students and Ann Arbor
residents, Liptak discussed
some of the unique aspects of
the Constitution, focusing on
its longevity - since the aver-
age constitution lasts 19 years
- and the short length of the
document, which leaves room
for ambiguity.
One of the more interesting
aspects of the Constitution is
the Bill of Rights, Liptak said,

because of the argument for-
warded by many of the feder-
alist Founding Fathers that it
is unnecessary and danger-
ous. Some argue its existence
proves that a few select rights
need to be protected, without
detailing how they should be
enforced and excluding other
considered rights.
"It's the Bill of Rights rather
than the Constitution's struc-
tural provisions that really cap-
ture your imagination," Liptak
said.
Liptak said a strong focus of

TAHE TROUBLE WI T H C oApRf
AArescues pre-law hopeful

z

Having your car break
down while wearing high
heels in the middle of a week-
night is a less than ideal start
to the semester, LSA junior
Starr Ford can attest.
Running late to an event for
her pre-law fraternity, Ford
and a few friends hurried to
find parking and ran to Angell
Hall in their business attire
without paying much atten-
tion to whether or not they
had shut off the car's hazard
lights.
Returning to her car after

the meeting, she noticed her
car lights "flashing like it was
possessed."
"We marked it up to anoth-
er incidentof#StarrProblem,"
Starr said.
Her calamity still not over,
Starr returned all the way
hometogetherjumper cables,
only to be driven back by a
friend and find out that the
cables were broken - after 30
minutes of tryingthem.
"At this time it was just
comical," she said.
She finally resolved to call

AAA, who came to her aid
after another hour.
Looking back on the night,
she said it was "not surpris-
ing" that she forgot to turn
her hazard lights off, as she
received four tickets and had
her car towed three times
since the beginning of sum-
mer.
"Parents should really feel
at ease knowing that these
are the type of drivers that
inhabit the roads at a school
they pay thousands of dollars
for," Starr said.

the University's high tuition, which
surpasses that of the other univer-
sities surrounding his properties,
factors into the demand for high-
rises.
"The fact that people are paying
that large amount for out-of-state
tuition generally shows a higher
income per capita per family," Perl-
man said.
Last year, The Washington Post
reported on George Washington
University's "rich kid" stigma.
It describes the scene at a roof-
top deck at one of the city's most
expensive apartment buildings -
surprisingly populated mostly by

students.
"The number one thingthat makes
you popular at GW is money," one
GW student told the Post.
Back in Ann Arbor, the housing
market reflects income disparity as
well. LSA junior Amina Fishburn
began her lease at Landmark this
September after living in Baits Hous-
es on North Campus her freshman
year and a sorority house her sopho-
more year.
"There have been times when I
don't necessarily want to tell people
where I live," Fishburn said. "A little
bit of a judgment does pass when you
live in Landmark or Zaragon or any of
the luxury apartments."
The first high-rise to sprout near
Central Campus was Zaragon Place,
which Perlman developed in 2009. It

is located about 1,200 steps from the
Diag, Perlman said. Three years later,
Perlman opened Zaragon West.
Perlman also owns property near
the campuses of Western Michigan
University and East Carolina Univer-
sity.
He said Ann Arbor is an expen-
sive town in terms of real estate. Ann
Arbor's urban settingmeans less land
and thus less area on which to build
housing.
"There isn't a bunch ofland to build
so you're forced then to build verti-
cally and that kind of construction is
much more expensive," Perlman said.
"With much more expensive con-
struction, you have to charge more to
rent."
On average, depending on the
occupancy of the unit, residents pay

from $1,000 to $1,400 per person
each month in Zaragon Place. The
International Center approximates
that the rent per person at a two-bed-
room apartment in Ann Arbor ranges
from $400 to $600 per month.
Fishburn said the cost is worth it.
"When it comes down to it, I don't
think people necessarily realize that
for what you're paying, you're actu-
ally getting a lot," she said.
Ladd said the storefronts in the
area are doing better because of the
additional business brought in by
high-rises such as Zaragon Place,
Landmark and the soon to open
ArborBLU.
"We're hopingthat long-term, stu-
dents will move out of the neighbor-
hoods and neighborhood houses will
revert back to family use."

to connect with groups they might
want to get involved with, including
exploring volunteer positions with
community organizations and join-
ing on-campus clubs.
For example, Art and Design junior

Dustin Park recently joined UMBees,
a student group that works to raise
awareness about the dwindling popu-
lation of bees - a topic that has gar-
nered national attention. Members
also take part in a variety of activities
to support healthy bee populations.
LSA senior Mary Hirt belongs to
the Undergraduate Sustainability
Scholars Program, part of the Gra-

ham Sustainability Institute. This
learning community for juniors and
seniors is a nine-credit course that,
upon students' graduation, grants its
members a certificate in sustainabil-
ity and provides up to $3,000 in fund-
ing for field experiences.
"I used my money to go study agro-
ecology in Cubathis summer," Hirt said.
She also said she particularly

appreciated the educational diversity
within the program.
"We come from all different
backgrounds," she said. "We have
engineers, people from the English
Department, International Studies,
so it's a really great community to get
involved with because you get many
differentperspectives on the issues of
sustainability."

being of the community's resi-
dents, collaborated with Chang. He
also created the program Parkside
Connected!- a repository of cell
phone numbers of the residents of
Parkside. FOP uses this program
to send out information such as
the time and location of important
community events, including food
giveaways or health fairs. During
Chang's research project, individu-

als who were part of Parkside Con-
nected! were recruited to be part of
the pilot study.
Twenty participants who were
familiar with receiving texts from
FOP received and answered mul-
tiple texts at varying times and
days regarding a range of topics.
"In our study, we asked them
what they would do in different
medical scenarios," Chang said.
"Another one we piloted was lit-
eracy and numeracy questions
where we basically used these
validated questions to understand
illiteracy and innumeracy of the

community. We were able to get
really great information that
could potentially be used to tailor
interventlions." -
In one medical 'scenario, the
participants received a text mes-
sage asking them what they
would do if one side of their body
became numb and they could
not talk. Because many people
responded that they would prob-
ably stay home, the researchers
determined that many residents
did not know the signs of a stroke.
This finding led to programming
to help spread the word in Park-

side about receiving proper medi-
cal care and being on watch for
health warning signs.
"'We sent the texts at differ-"
nt times of the day and different
days of the week because some-
times their regular doctor's office
would be open and sometimes
it wouldn't," Chang said. "We
would want to know, oh, would
they stay home, or would they go
to the emergency room."
Karen Daniels, a Parkside
resident who participated in the
study, said she heard about the
study from a text message she

received
and decid-

ed to par-
tiipate so she could improve her
texting skills. Danielsalso said
she now prefers texting to other
forms of communication.
"It's faster than talking on the
phone and you get to the point
faster," Daniels said. "I would defi-
nitely answer a text before I would
answer avoicemail."
Using texting to gather infor-
mation also has many impli-
cations for nonprofits and
community organizations. These


groups could potentially direct
'quhstifisn to members of the com-
munities they are trying to help
about how to use the nonprofits'
resources, and about what those
communities' top priorities are.
"I don't want just me to use this
technology," Chang said. "I hope
that other people see how easy it
can be and then how they may be
able to incorporate the opinions
and the viewpoints of the people
they're working with as well."


REPORTER
From Page 1A
Chief Justice John Roberts' court
is First Amendment protection.
"And it has, without question,
ruled for free speech in hard
cases," he said.
However, Liptak noted while
many view the Roberts court
as favoring freedom of speech
to the extreme, the court has
heard fewer cases than the pre-
vious three courts. Recent First
Amendment cases focus on laws
regarding campaign funds.

For example, Justice Antonin
Scalia respects the Constitu-
tion's guarantee of free speech,
Liptak said, defending it even
when it conflicts with his own
ideologies.
"(Justice Scalia) likes to tell the
story of how much it pained him
when he voted to strike down a
law making flag-burning a crime,"
Liptak said. "Here is what he said:
'If it was up to me, if I were king,
I would take the scruffy, bearded,'
sandal-wearingidiotsburningthe
flag and I would put them in jail.'
They come to the bench not with
an agenda, but with a sense of

neutral and dispassionate frame
of law."
Liptak also noted that this
viewpoint is often an outlier, and
politics do make their way into
the court.
"With the exception of Justice
(Stephen) Breyer, who's really
pretty much 50-50, all of the jus-
tices were more likely to favor
(their party line); the liberal jus-
tices were more likely to favor
liberal speakers, and conservative
justices conservative speakers,"
Liptak said.
He said while the Roberts
court is generally straying away

from sweeping rulings on hot-
button issues such as abortion,
gay rights and affirmative action,
Liptak said Zivotofsky v. Kerry, a
case the court is currently hear-
ing that deals with the stance on
listing Jerusalem versus listing
Israel as one's birthplace on U.S.
passports, stands to impact U.S.
foreign policy.
"Whatever the Supreme Court
decides, in the matter of Ameri-
can Constitutional law, the Mid-
dle Eastern press will report on
it in a kind of shorthand; and the
Supreme Court decision itself
may have an impact on their for-

eign policy," Liptak said.
Liptak said the court will also
address whether someone can be
prosecuted for issuing threats on
Facebook that are quotes from rap
lyrics.
At the reception, when asked
about his opinion of the Constitu-
tion's effectiveness, Liptaksaidhe
is behind the document as a legal
device.
"It's a work of genius," Liptak
said. "It's endured for a longtime,
and we are lucky to have it."
Public Policy junior Julie Sarne
said she came to the event because
of her interest in the constitution,

and how the current Court inter-
prets it.
"I think this event provided
a great forum for that because it
was more about how we report on
the court and how the court has
evolved and how that reflects the
Constitution today," she said.
Public policy junior Nick Rine-
hart said he was interested in a
reporter's take onthe court.
"It was interesting to hear
from his unique perspective,"
Rinehart said. "He gave pretty
candid comments and that's
something you don't usually get
from a reporter."

groups are said to be responsible
for a significant amount of this
violence, and while the Justice
and Peace Law attempts to quan-
tify the disruption and violence
within communities, Castillejo-
Cuellar emphasized Colombia's
need for a strategy that is more
sensitive to the individuals and
communities at the heart of these
conflicts. He described current
methods as the "surgical extrac-
tion of testimony."
"There exist some forms of
violence that are not perceived
as such," Castillejo-Cuellar said.
"We require institutional proce-
dures as well as direct testimo-
nies in order to fully understand,
but what happens when testi-
monials cannot be easily classi-

fied? Extended narratives are not
investigated, officials speak in
Spanish, notilocal languages, and
we see a domestication of testi-
monies."
Through anecdotal stories and
personal experience, Castillejo-
Cuellar described the varyingkinds
of violence and poverty Colombi-
ans experience. He implored pol-
icy makers and researchers to use
methods of analysis that include an
understanding of individuals and
the histories of their communities
in a waythatdoes notdisregardthe
past.
To rectify what Castillejo-
Cuellar said he considers the
shortcomings of the Peace and
Justice Law, he wants to rede-
sign these short and 'uninvolved
methods of data collection sothat
they better reflect the experienc-
es of Colombians.
"Imagine a different kind of

investigation that includes these
kinds of conceptions of harm and
violence in a different way," he
said. "There is a need for histori-
cal clarification."
Following the lecture, Cas-
tillejo-Cudllar offered a Q&A
session with students and attend-
ees. Some of these queries per-
tained to his take on entering and
interacting with communities
like those in Colombia, as well
as his opinion on the prospects
for peace in Colombia. He said
with new methods of research
and policy-making, Colombia
has an opportunity to move for-
ward, though its past is still key
in determining its future.
"When I say I am from Colom-
bia, everyone knows this means
political conflict and drug wars
and all ofthis,"he said. "That term,
'political conflict,' is now some-
how engraved in our identity."

While at this point Castillejo-
Cuellar remains somewhat pessi-
mistic about a peaceful future for
Colombia, there remains some
hope for his country. The Justice
and Peace Law and other policies
may give Colombians a sense of
false security, of only aesthetic
change. Castillejo-Cuellar hopes
to bring this history of violence
and the victims of this violence
to the forefront of policy-making
moving forward.
"I think we still lack the politi-
cal leadership to move the pro-
cess even further forward. We
lack the leadership of someone
like Nelson Mandela," he said.
"You live, in my experience,
there and you have this sense of
everything is cool, everything is
fine and moving forward, butyou
have this sense that underneath
there is something wrong, a war
going on."

Defining the Michigan man

n the wake of the Michigan men's
basketball team's successful season last
year, the news of both Mitch McGary's
failed drug test and
subsequent decision to
leave for the NBA was
startling. Failing they
NCAA-administered drug
test left McGary with a
one-year suspension from
play, and reportedly forced
his hand in his decision
to begin preparing for LAUREN
a career in the NBA. MCCARTHY
The University Athletic
Department attempted
to appeal the decision in
early April, but was ultimately unsuccessful.
Acornerstone ofthe Michiganbasketballteam,
prominent leader and enormous personality was
leaving campus - and the stpdents responded.
Many defended McGary, claiming that the
punishment did not fit the crime. It was argued
that McGary had only smoked "just this once,"
and countless students and fans maintained that,
nonetheless, McGary would forever in their eyes
be considered a "Michigan Man".
The definition of a "Michigan Man" is
generally understood to be an upstanding, loyal
and passionate individual; someone who is not
only dedicated to the values of the University but
who also embodies those virtues in his everyday
actions. Bo Schembechler, the legendary
Michigan football coach of 21 remarkable
seasons, is universally regarded as a "Michigan
Man" and remembered for his superior ethics.
However, there are more "Michigan Men" out
there who do not coach a sports team, and (sorry
Bo)they hail from alloverthe country and planet.
Too often is this term used to describe or
commemorate the obvious candidates: the
athletes who herald championships or the select
few campus leaders who run Central Student
Government. The University of Michigan has
nea , 0,00 undergraduate students, more,
than 15,000 graduate students, and yet for years
on end those who often lead the discussion about
who deserves to be categorized as a "Michigan
Man" select from only a small pool of students
when crowning whom they believe deserve to be
categorized as "MichiganMen".
I can't comfortably justify Mitch McGary
as the epitome of a "Michigan Man", not when
there are countless other students, alumni

and faculty who are far more dedicated to
the embodiment of true Michigan values.
This campus is littered with unsung heroes
and passionate leaders who deserve the
recognition of the student body as well as
student publications. They may not be lead
scorers or team captains, and nonetheless the
contributions they make to the University are
oftentimes significantly more pertinent than
almost winning a national championship.
With a trend of personality journalism on the
rise, many writers, publishers and producers are
all too concerned with their own public image -
trolling their social media sites and shamelessly
promoting their articles or on-air appearances
via their personal, online platforms. This
industry is sliding into a worrisome environment
of ownership, neglecting to focus on their
subjects and their stories and too often inserting
themselves into the discourse.
In a community as expansively rich as this
campus, I view it as wildly irresponsible not to
invest the time and energy into seeking out the
"Michigan Men"(and women) who I have heard
of time and time again:the friend of a friend who
has impacted many through his or her unfailing
kindness and grace, the boyfriend of a sorority
sister who started a revolutionary new student
organization or the quiet classmate who subtly
mentionstheir involvementin andutter devotion
to social justice on campus.
A "Michigan Man" (or woman) is an
individual who is rooted in tradition, yet seeks
innovation and strives for constant progress.
He works within the rules, while also making
the rules work for him. A "Michigan Man" takes
full advantage of the opportunities provided by
the Michigan community, while also lending
a hand to those who may be less advantaged. A
"Michigan Man" is intent on being a successful,
well-educated and fair citizen who invests his
time back into the betterment of the University.
He takes pride in the institution as a whole, as
well as his own personal accomplishments. A
"Michigan Man" is a loyal, steadfast and true
leader, who rises to the occasion and inspires
others to do the same.
Please assist me in finding these Michigan
men and women on campus (students and
faculty alike), and please e-mail me at laurmc@
umich.edu with suggestions.

HEMA KARUNAKARAM I
T,
There's half a tube of Fair and
Lovely in the bottom drawer of my
bathroom. I haven't used it in years,
but I can't bring myself to throw it
out. Scattered elsewhere among the
drawersaretubesofFaireverMantra,
Vicco Turmeric Fairness Cream, and
Himalaya Fairness Cream, all in
various states of usage. Part of me
hates that I've used these products. I
should be above all these superficial
notions about ideal complexion by
now. But part of me clings to them
- clings to the insecurity I've had
since I was a little girl about the color
of my skin, clings to my subsequent
obsession with lightening my skin
and changing people's perceptions
of me.
I am Indian-American, and I am
dark-skinned. To be specific, I'm
closest to HTML color #A0522D, or
what I call a "dull mocha." They say
it's genetic; but save for my maternal
grandfather, I'm the darkest person
on both sides of my family. So? It's
just the color of my skin - it's not
who Iam.
Or at least it shouldn't be.
The societal preference for light
skin is no new phenomenon in
India. Billboards promoting fair
skin are embellished with the face
of actress Katrina Kaif - who is in
fact half white. Commercials feature
girls who've used fairness creams
getting movie offers from the likes
of noted director Rakesh Roshan.
Matrimonial ads ubiquitously seek
women who are not just smart and
talented, but, more importantly,
fair-skinned. These unrealistic
expectations and their effects on
the self-esteem of women in India
has been well documented and
frequently discussed. But the bias
toward light skin isn't confined to
India. It's traveled across the world
to Indian-Americans as well, and has
followed me for the 19 years I've lived
in the U.S.
This isn't a subject I generally feel
comfortable discussing because it
seems ridiculous that such notions
persist in a country as diverse as
the U.S. For all the education and
awareness about equality found
in America, Indian-Americans
seem, too often, to still harbor this
preference for the fair-skinned.,
Indians in America are proud to

treat other races with respect, but
they often overlook - or in fact
perpetuate - the bias that occurs in
our own community. Sure, there are
plenty of Indian-American youths
who proudly decry Fair and Lovely
ads and eagerly support looking past
skin color. But there are also obvious,
unforgettable instances in which
I'm reminded of how being dark is a
bad thing.
I have been told to my face, here
in America, that some people will
never find me attractive because my
skin is too dark.,I have heard with
my own ears, here in America, that
character is the most important
factor in assessing a potential Indian
groom, but a potential Indian bride
must first and foremost be fair-
skinned, and therefore beautiful. I
have seen people right in front of me,
here in America, judge afair-skinned
Indian as likely more intelligent and
successful than a dark-skinned one.
All the self-esteem promotion out
there is great to see, to hear, to nod
at - but it's not helpful in a world
where people are still judged by
their complexion.
Young girls are repeatedly told
not to idolize what they see in the
media, because "no one actually
looks like that." To that end, I don't
think I've ever wanted to look like
Katrina Kaif or Kareena Kapoor or
any other fair-skinned Bollywood
celebrity. My insecurity comes from
frequently, being surrounded by
Indian-Americans who are lighter
than me and keenly being made
aware of that fact. And thus I keep
wishing I look more like my fairer
peers. Because my skin isn't glowing
against the lights like everyone else's
when I'm on stage. Because I'm the
least visible person in that picture
taken outside at night. Because I
can't borrow my friend's makeup,
whose colors wouldn't suit me. These
are simply facts that naturally arise
from differences in complexion, but
I've been brainwashed to repeatedly
look at them in a negative light.
When someone calls me "dark," I
take it as an insult. The problem, I tell
myself, isn't what they've said - it's
my reaction. I reassure myself with
the copious amounts of research
I've done, almost obsessively, on, the
science of complexion (jn short: you,

Jncomfortable

can darken your skin, but you can't
lightenit). Ilookinthemirrorandtry
to accept myself for who I am. And
then I hear a joke the next day about
me looking "dull" or "invisible." Cue
the incessant water consumption,
the herbal remedies, the salon face
bleaching, and the use of one of those
tubes from my drawers for another
week or two. I know I'm so much
more than the color of my skin, but
somehow that one trait has become
one of my primary identifying
features over the years - and it's
stuck as something wrong with
myself that I can never change.
I have dark brown eyes, black
hair, long fingers, a birthmark
above my left knee, and, medium-
dark brown skin. That's what I
look like, but it doesn't define me.
I'm a student, a leader, a dancer,
a writer, a musician, a daughter
and a friend. That's what defines
me, and that's who I hope people
accept me as. But reality is not
so simple. No amount of writing,
discussing, or convincing will
likely make me truly comfortable
in my own skin. So for now I turn
to the new Himalaya Clarifying
Fairness Face Wash on my desk I
bought yesterday, knowing fully
well that it won't do anything for
my complexion, but hoping anyway.
Author's note: This piece has
been nearly three years in the
making, but it still rings just as true
today as it was when I first wrote it.
I had the opportunity to present a
version of this piece at this year's
Yoni Ki Baat monologue show - a
big step in the long journey toward
my self-acceptance. Finally, I am
ready to take a giant leap, to be
vulnerable in front of the largest
audience in the world: the Internet.
Although emotions may evolve over
time, these words have an impact
on me every time I read over them
- reminding me that no matter
where we go and no matter how we
change, we carry our experiences
forever in our back pockets.

LINDSEY LAIRD I
Arts as a means for womens issues

In my opinion, art can be an extremely
accessible, sensitive and diverse medium. If
we are looking in the right places, we can find
voices in art that are not typically included in
mainstream discussions. One of these is the
voice one of women, specifically women from
other parts of the world that are operating
under different cultural and social norms.
The first artistI'mbringingto the forefront
is Amanda Heng. Heng is a contemporary
artist currently living in Singapore. Her
exhibit seen above is entitled "Missing."
The picture isn't incredibly clear, but the
work is a collection of white paper mkch6
dresses in a black room. Heng created this
piece as a memorial for the female victims of
infanticide. Female infanticide is the killing
of a female child before her first birthday.
Selective female fetus abortion is considered
female infanticide since it represents the
same desire. Currently, female infanticide is
a prominent phenomenon in places such as
China, India, Taiwan, Korea, Bangladesh,
Nepal and Pakistan.
Though sex-selective abortion is illegal in
most places worldwide, it remains a significant
issue in countries where the rejection of
females and desire for male children is deeply
rooted in the cultural fabric. One source of
this desire for male children is patrilocality,
which is practiced in many of these countries.
Patrilocality is the custom by which a woman
leaves her birth family to join her husband's
upon marriage. This allows sons to care for
their aging parents while daughters aren't able
to offer this security net to their family. Dowry
payments upon a daughter's marriage are
another custom that causes strain (though this
time economic) on families with daughters.
Additionally, the one child policy announced
. in 1978 in China has drastically increased the
number of female infanticide victims. With the
possibility, nowadays, to determine the sex of a
fetus prior to birth, sex-selective abortion is the
most common form of female infanticide.
Female infanticide offers us another lens
through which to view the common Western
and American feminist debate on abortion
rights. If one were to enter into a discussion with
a feminist living in one of the aforementioned
societies,theirstanceonabortionwould probably
be influenced by the prevalence of female

infanticide. While notwantingto speak forthese
women, I speculate that they wouldn't be as
fervent in their advocacy for cheap, widespread
access to abortion. Obviously, I'm not suggesting
a regression of the progress the pro-choice
movement has (or hasn't...) made in America
and other countries. I'm simply suggesting that
Western pro-choice movements are limited to
their own cultural circumstances. Because of
this, I'm advocating for us to incorporate into
our stance on abortion the very real, yet different
realitiesofwomenlivinginsocietiesandcultures
thatplace greater importance onmale children
You may be wondering why it is important
for us to have these cultural sensitivities when
thinking about issues such as abortion in the
United States. For one, we need to recognize
that our (America's/the West's) actions often
have far-reaching consequences throughout
the global realm. This, in and of itself, may be
a problembut is often still the case nonetheless.
As anexample, one can clearlyseethe influence
of the West even in the origins of feminism in
China in the late 19th and early 20th.
Liang Qichao's 1897 essay entitled "On
Women's Education" makes it very clear that
much of the early thoughts on and progress
made for women in China had to do with the
West's approach to similar issues. An excerpt
from his essay states, "If we were to have a small
schoolboy from the West walk side by side with
our majestic and aged official-scholars, the
boy's varied knowledge and ambitions would
certainly exhibit features with which our
scholars could not compete" (Liu 194).
This quote shows how Chinese scholars of this
erawerebothcompetingwithandtryingtomimic
the West. (For more essays and information on
the beginnings of Chinese feminism reference
"The Birth of Chinese Feminism" cited below).
This pattern of influence is one to be cautious of
even in the 21st century.
Secondly, it's obviously important for
us, as students and scholars, to broaden
our knowledge of women's issues globally.
This will only strengthen our own feminist
movements and studies at home aswe attempt
to take a more nuanced and culturally aware
approach to issues such as abortion.

n an intellectual sense, the
University isn't lying when
it boasts about diversity on
campus. The
sheer number
of academic
programs t

even Harvard
- sorry, the
Michigan of ERIC
the East - to FERGUSON
shame, and
creates a vibrant
body of students with unique
backgrounds and differing
viewpoints. The University has
its share of excitement as well -
it has attracted President Barack
Obama here three times since
2010, and a century-old obsession
with football turns campus into a
madhouse on a regular basis. All
of this and more makes this town
the most interesting place to live
in (and, somehow, the second-
best city in the United States for
dating. Go figure).
But Ann Arbor isn't always
the best place to be for four full
academic years. Study abroad and
away programs provide unique
opportunities to learn, intern,
use language skills and mature
on a personal level. These places
offer students of all.majors new
opportunities and a different
brand of excitement than the
norm, and thanks to copious
amounts of scholarship funding,
they have become increasingly
accessible to students in
recent years.
In other words, all of us at
Michigan face a question: If not
Ann Arbor, where?
For this American politics
and international relations-
obsessed Public' Policy major,

Washington, D.C. was the only
answer. I spent last winter
taking classes and interning
there through the Michigan in
Washington Program, and it was
the Holy Grail of off-campus
undergraduate experiences. The
work experience was interesting
and useful, the classes were
unique, and living in the heart
of D.C. afforded me some of the
best access I may ever get to its
attractions - from congressional
hearings and rallies on the Hill to
events hosted by institutions such
as the Bipartisan Policy Center
and the Atlantic Council.
It's hard to find flaws in
the city to which you intend
to move after graduation, but
D.C. doesn't have the kinds
of spaces good for thinking,
reflectingand working without
interruption that are spread all
over the University's campus.
The tradeoffs, though, more than
made up for that particular weak
point. In addition to the seats of
all three branches of government,
famed and historic landmarks
like the Lincoln Memorial, the
Smithsonian's National Air and
Space Museum and the National
Mall were all accessible on a
whim. And in all of their fame
and history, these places within
a placechanged me in ways no
internship, book or Mason Hall
class could have possibly done.
Let me give you an example.
One frigid Thursday night late
last January, my roommate and I
decided to brave the cold and go
down to the western end of the
Mall. The city was nearly as dead
at 11 p.m. as Ann Arbor usually
is at 4 a m., and seemed about as
safe. We made our way through
the city, down past the long

Reflecting Pool and to the steps
of the Lincoln Memorial. It was
my roommate's first time there,
and he listened to Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s "I Have A Dream"
speech while standing where he
once stood - a fitting act for a
future civil rights lawyer.
Afterwards, we moved on
to what I wanted to see for the
first time: the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial. Few places in D.C.,
Ann Arbor or elsewhere compare
to this, and entering it that night
was one of the most powerful
experiences I have ever had.
As my roommate and I started
walking along the Memorial
Wall, it rose from just 8 inches
to over 10 feet tall - the height
of one American soldier's name
to several, to dozens and then
scores of names etched into a
sober sea of burnished black
granite. It immersed us in the
memories of those lost in a war
overwhelmingly rejected by a
generation of college students,
for whom conscription rendered
it far too close to home. Even now,
back home in Ann Arbor at last for
a little while longer, it lingers in
my mind as both a memorial and
a reminder of how devastating
governmental failure can be for
nations at war.
That night, those thousands of
names seared the human costs
of war into my mind in a new
and very permanent way. I am a
better person for it, and will (I
hope) make a better policymaker
someday as a result of that
experience and my time in D.C.
That place is my answer.
What's yours?

Sar kisian shines in B Ten

By SHAWN HEROOR
For the Daily
Big Ten coaches watched
Nkem Ezurike bully defenses
for four years and were glad to
see Michigan's all-time leading
scorer graduate.
Unfortunately for conference
foes, they may have a new
headache to deal with on the
Michigan women's soccer team:
redshirt freshman forward Ani
Sarkisian.
Sarkisian, a transfer. from
Florida State, introduced herself
to the Big Ten with three goals
in a pair of Wolverine victories
last weekend. After netting her
first on Friday against Minnesota,
Sarkisian added a pair of goals
against the ninth-ranked Badgers
on Sunday, scoring the decisive
goal with only one second left in
the match.
The red-hot weekend for the
freshman helped her garner
Big Ten Offensive Player of
the Week and Freshman of the
Week honors.
Following a decorated high

school career, Sarkisian joined
the heralded Seminole program,
but spent the 2013 season on the
bench for a talented Florida State
squad. Sarkisian then decided
she wanted a change, making
the jump to the Wolverines this
summer.
"I've never met a group so
family-oriented," Sarkisian said.
" I came right in and fit right in.
... Everything about the program,
the teammates, the coaches, the
academics, everything was just
perfect for me."
After a slow start to the season,
in which she failed to register
a goal in the first four games,
Sarkisian has caught fire during
Michigan's recent four-game
winning streak. She scored four
times to go along with four assists
for the Wolverines (2-0 Big Ten,
6-2 overall). Most of her goals
have been simple tap-ins and one-
time shots, a result of Sarkisian
putting herself in the right spot at
the righttime.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
credits Sarkisian's poacher
mentality as the reason for her

recent outburst.
"She's been making hard runs
to the ball, getting herself open
in dangerous positions for us to
get her the ball," Ryan said. "She's
really performed well in every
game."
Ryan admitted there was a
learning curve for the freshman
as she transitioned from different
schools, teammates and a new
system. Sarkisian is one of
several new starters the team has
introduced after losing the core of
last season's Elite Eight squad.
"She is just learning like
everyone else," Ryan said. "We're
so young, we're just learning the
basics of playing with each other.
We're just lackingthat chemistry.
"For Ani to play so well so early
for us is huge for our growth."
Sarkisian's big weekend
helped vault Michigan to the
top of the conference standings,
where they sit tied with Iowa
and Penn State. With the bulk
of the Big Ten season remaining,
conference opponents will get no
reprieve from the Wolverines'
relentless attack.

reporters
didn't even have to ask to get
the response. It took all of 37
seconds before he reiterated his
stance in his opening statement
at his Wednesday press
conference.
"We're notgoingtotalkabout
injuries, and I might as well
bring that up now," Hoke said.
"And some of that is because
you can say something and then
you're wrong. Everybody heals
a bit differently.
And then the other thing is,
for our kids, I want to make
sure that we're doing a good job
protecting them."
Hoke offered up little about
who would fill in for his four
injuredstarters, includingthree
on a depleted defense that will
face a potent passing offense
against Utah this weekend.
Cornerback Raymon Taylor,
safety Jarrod Wilson and
linebacker Desmond Morgan

vs. Miami (Ohio).

quarterback Travis Wilson -
currently ranked second in the

Hoke pointed to his depth
chart for who would replace
the duo, though the depth

at the top of their respective
positions.

Freshmen, defense adjust

Wolverines look to
regain focus after loss

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
The games may have finished,
but hockey never truly left Ann
Arbor.
While many students moved
out of residence halls and
apartments, for
the returning NOTEBOOK
players and
incoming freshmen of the
Michigan hockey team, Yost Ice
Arena remained a second home
during the offseason months.
"Alotofourguys stayed around
for the summer, so we not only
got some good workouts in but
developed some team cohesion
early on," said junior forward
Andrew Copp. "I think all of the
freshmenwere here atsome point
this summer."
Copp, who was voted team
captain by his teammates and
coaches at the conclusion of last
season has helped lead summer
and preseason workouts alongside
assistant captains, senior forward
Zach Hyman and sophomore
forward JT Compher. Due to
NCAA regulations, Michigan
coach Red Berenson and the rest
of his coaching staff are unable
to be on the ice with the team for
more than 30 minutes during each
practice until Oct. 3, only one day
before Michigan's first regular-
seasongame.
That's left much of the
responsibility to the trio of
captains. Amidst the role
of mentoring another large
recruiting class, Copp, Hyman,
and Compher had the added
pressure of guiding Michigan
back to the NCAA Tournament
for the firsttime since 2012.
"Andrew's been through it
before as an assistant captain
and I think he has a good feel for
the team," Berenson said. "Zach
Hyman is a really good role model
for this team, and then JT is the
young blood on that group and
he's obviously a good young role
model and he's into it big time."
Freshmen Frenzy: After the
Wolverine coaching staff brought
in a nine-member freshman class
last season, it nearly replicated

that mark with an eight-player
class for the upcoming campaign.
The notable freshmen that
Berenson expects to make
an immediate impact include
forward Dylan . Larkin and
defenseman Zach Werenski.
Larkin and Werenski are
roommates this year, and
Werenski claims "their basically
the same person." In some sense,
he's correct.
Both were the two most
highly sought-after recruits.
Larkin produced a standout
season in 2013-14 with the U-18-
United States National Team
Development Program, recording
56 points (31 goals, 25 assists).
He was drafted 15th overall by
the Detroit Red Wings in this
summer's NHL draft.
"Dylan Larkin is really good,"
Copp said with a wide grin. "He's
got great hockey instincts, he's
good with
the puck and
he's got some
speed." "He's a

a year early after committing to
Michigan.AsamemberoftheU-17
U.S. NTDP, Werenski finished
with 27 points (seven goals, 20
assists) in 47 games last year.
According to the 2014-15 NHL
CSS Futures North American
List, he's considered one of the
top draft-eligible defensemen for
the upcoming NHL draft.
"He bit off a lot when he made
the decision to come in early,"
Berenson said. "He just turned 17
around April or May, and he's a lot
more mature than his age would
indicate. He's catching up quick.
He's not out of place in any of the
workouts."
Unknown D-Zone: Werenski
has made such great strides in
minimal time that Berenson has
firmly stated the youngster should

find his way into the top-two
defensive pairings this season.
Sophomores Michael Downing
and Kevin Lohan figure to place
among the top-four defensemen,
as well.
Similar to the beginning of last
season, Berenson has expressed
his pleasure with the depth of
his defensive corps. But, then
again, by the end of the 2013-14
season, the Wolverines' defense
had surrendered an average of
2.54 goals per game, much to the
disappointment of Berenson and
his staff. So whether or not his
assessment will hold true remains
to be seen.
"Last year, I thought we were
deep on defense and that didn't
hold up," Berenson said. "The
team didn't live up to some of
our expectations. Defensively, I
can go, 'Oh we were better,' but
defensively, we were still short."
With a full

Bate." so, last year's
promising
play of senior
Andrew
Sinelli should
provide a necessary boost to what
became a depleted defensive unit.
Berenson confirmed Tuesdaythat
Sinelli has officially made the
full transition from his natural
forward position to a starting
defenseman.
,"Sinelli, the way he played at
the end of last year, he's going to
help our defense," Berenson said.
"He's the guy that can hopefully
replace some of Mac Bennett's
puck carrying and speed on D."
If Sinelli can fill such big skates,
especially in both ends of the

For the Daily
The Michigan men's soccer
team may have lost its focus ina
1-0 loss to Bowling Green (5-1)
on Tuesday, overlooking a team
that dropped its first game last
week.
Now, the Wolverines will
have to regain that focus
before they play a team that
also suffered its first loss of the
season last week when it travels
to Northwestern.
"Sometimes you think about
things a little bit too much,"
said Michigan coach Chaka
Daley, "and you might put
yourself ahead of where you
are."
The season is still young,
but as Michigan sits fifth i
the conference (0-1 Big Ten,
1-3-1 overall), this weekend'
game could prove to be pivotal.
It marks Michigan's second
away game and second Big Ten
matchup of the season.
"There's still plenty to play
for, both out of conference an
in the Big Ten," Daley said.
"It's not the end of the season.
I think we've demonstrated
that we can compete against
some of the better teams and I
think we've demonstrated that
sometimes we're inconsistent."
Contributing to the slow
start could be the great
deal of change the team has
undergone. The Wolverines
have six new freshmen, made
a tactical switch to a 4-4-2
formation in place of the old
4-3-3, and more recently, a
intriguing goalkeeping battle
has been brewing.
Freshman goalie Evan Louro
got the nod over fifth-yea
senior Adam Grinwis for his
third start of the season against
the Falcons. Though his tea
lost, Louro let up only one goal
and made some exceptional
saves to keep the Wolverines i
the game.

Daley was unwilling to name
a starter for the Northwestern
game, but his decision may not
have big implications for the
rest of the season.
"We have two excellent
goalkeepers," Daley said.
"Whichever goalkeeper we feel
is best for a particular game,
they're both going to be ready,
so we'll see how that goes."
The final result wasn't
representative of the game,
though, as Michigan outplayed
Bowling Green for most of the
match.
Despite outshooting their
opponents, 20-10, dominating
possession and ceding very few
quality chances, the Wolverines
couldn't stick one in the back
of the net. It cost them dearly,

as Bowling Green was able to
capitalize on a counterattack
in the 17th minute, which
ultimately proved to be the
deciding goal.
Even in the face of this
difficult loss, Daley held
steadfast to his belief that
chemistry and victories will
come with time.
"This is a program that we're
building for the long term.
It's not just for tomorrow or
just for today versus Bowling
Green," Daley said. "We have
to continue to work, be positive
and continue to find solutions."
The Wolverines have five
days to do just that, and on
Sunday, Daley will find out
just how resilient his Michigan
team is.

Event Spotlight: 2014 Parents' Weekend
featuring guest speaker John U. Bacon

By BRAD WHIPPLE
WeekendRoundupEditor
This Saturday, 100,000-plus
people will file into the Big House
for a college football tradition
like none other.
Some will be students,
others alumni and 25 percent
will not have even attended
the University. But according
to John U. Bacon, a renowned
sports journalist and a University
lecturer, it won't matter what
background you come from. If
you put your hand in the air and
say, "Hail,"you'rewelcome.
These are traditions that
define college football programs,
each with rich cultures and
histories surrounding them for
future generations to discover
andbecome apartof. Thatiswhy
the preservation of the sport's
integrity is now more important
than ever.
1 Friday at 4 p.m., Bacon will,
address his concerns about the
future of college football in his
event "The Fight for the Soul of
College Football: Who's Winning
and Why it Matters."
The event is a University

histories. According to Bacon,
NFL teams "have no cultures,
and players go to the highest
bidder rather than a senior in
high school who chooses the
school they love.
Another example is how the
Wisconsin Badgers' current
football stadium, Camp Randall
Stadium, was a Union Army
training camp during the Civil
War. Meanwhile, the Detroit
Lions have changed stadiums
three times in the last 76 years,
so their field lacks sentimental
value.
One of Bacon's main
talking points this Friday'
will be his distress over the
commercialization of college
football.
- "The biggest scandal is
greed," Bacon said. "If there's
anything that's going to bring
it down, it's not going to be a
student athlete and it's not going
to be the fans; it's goingto be the
greed of those who realized how
much money is to be made from
this institution."

Parent's weekend for many
students is an opportunity to
show the couple-in-charge just
how awesome and independent
you now are in college.
However, others may cringe
at the thought of having to
entertain their family for an
entire weekend. Don't worry,
though, because we've planned
your whole weekend for you.

Pretty standard, but you can
probably expect your parents
are going to want to see your

Ann Arbor named most
educated city in America
Tuesday, WalletHub.com named
Ann Arbor the most educated city in
the United States.
WalletHub analyzed 150 of
the largest metropolitan cities
across the country, with rankings
determined by two key metrics:
"education level" and "quality of
education."
The number one ranking came
two days after the city earned the
number 13 spot in Livability.com's
Top 100 Best Places to Live.
University awarded grant to
studyalgalblooms
Wednesday, state officials
announced that University
researchers will be awarded a
$653,097 federal grant from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
According to Sen. Carl Levin (D-
Mich.) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.), researchers will use
the grant to create tools that will
predict water quality and harmful
algal blooms in the Great Lakes.
Domestic violence crackdown in
National Football League
On Sept. 8, video footage was
released of . Baltimore Ravens
running back Ray Rice knocking
out his then-fianc in a domestic
violence incident, which led to his
indefinite suspension by NFL
Commissioner Roger Goodell.
Back in July, the NFL suspend-
ed Rice for the first two games of
the season. But with the new evi-
dence, Goodell enforced a harsher
punishment and Rice, represented
by the NFL Player's Association,

appealed the decision Tuesday.
On top of the Rice incident,
Minnesota Vikings running back
Adrian Peterson was indicted on
charges of beating his 4-year-old
son with a tree branch. Peterson
was benched Sunday against the
New England Patriots, but rein-
stated Monday. After the Vikings'
decision was met with criticism of
being insensitive to child abuse, the
team banned Peterson from all team
activities on Wednesday morning.
Wednesday night, Arizona
Cardinals deactivated their backup
running back Jonathan Dwyer,
after he was arrested for domes-
tic abuse allegations. A report filed
to .the Phoenix Police Department
last week cited consecutive days in
July when the incidents occurred.
Police said the alleged victims
include a 27-year-old female and an
18-month-old child.
Scotland to vote on separation
from United Kingdom
Thursday, Scotland could
become the 31st country to be
formed since World War II.
The Scottish National Party is
staging a referendum on whether
or not Scotland should become
independent from the United King-
dom, which would end a 300-year
history of unification. Eligible
voters include Scottish residents
aged 16 and older.
The issue has stirred mass
controversy on both sides of the
debate. Alex Salmond, first minis-
ter of Scotland, said it is time for the
country to be free from the "shack-
les" of the London-based U.K. Par-
liament, but British Prime Minister
David Cameron, in his final visit to
Scotland, pleaded against the initia-
tive, saying the separation would be
a "painful divorce."
Voting results will likely be
released on Friday, September 19th.

The whole
No ketchup on a
hot dog thing

ARTIST AVANTNGARDE

f you go to Amer's Deli
on State Street, you'll
see a poster on the wall
that seems to advertise a movie
about hot dogs. At the bottom of
said poster is
a little box,
where you
would expect
the MPAA
rating to go.
But insteadx
of reading
"Rated R, for GIANCARLO
language and BUONOMO
brief nudity,"
it says "NK-
17- No ketchup unless under 17."
No matter how hard you try, you
can never escape the most perva-
sive rule about food in the United
States: No ketchup on a hot dog.
Ever.
Now, there are innumerable
"rules" concerning certain dishes,
but these are usually a reflection
of regional traditions and tastes.
Texas chili is beanless. Chicago
pizza is deep dish. Most Phila-
delphia purists will insist that a
cheesesteak be made with Cheez
Whiz. The list goes on and on.
In fact, hot dogs are probably
the most region-specific food in
our country. A hot dog from a cart
in Manhattan will be a Sabrett-
brand frank with brown mustard,
stewed onions and tomatoes, and
sauerkraut. In Chicago, it will be
an all-beef Vienna dog in a poppy
seed bun with yellow mustard,
chopped onion, green relish,
pickle spears, sliced tomatoes,
hot peppers and celery salt. Right
here in Michigan, we have Coney
Islands (ground beef chili, yel-
low mustard, onions), the com-
bination whichtfunny enough,
is called in upstate New York a
"Michigan," and in Rhode Island
a "New York System."
Whether it be chili or pizza
or hot dogs, the specifics for
these specialties are often more
positive than negative. In other
words, a certain preparation is
demanded, certain ingredients
must be used, and it must be
eaten in a certain way. Yes, the
differences can seem petty and
even unappetizing - it took rpe
a solid year to transition from
kosher hot dogs with brown
mustard to Coney Islands - but
food is one of the most powerful
sources of regional identity, and

to literallytaste that identity is a
potent experience indeed.
Given all of this regional speci-
ficity, the whole "no ketchup on
a hot dog" thing becomes quite
puzzling. Why? Because "no
ketchup on a hot dog" isn't a
regional taste, but rather a uni-
versal condemnation. One of the
heads of Nathan's Famous Hot
Dogs in NYC referred to putting
ketchup on ahot dog as a sign
of a "less sophisticated" palate.
Superdawg in Chicago is so anti-
ketchup that they refuse to put
it on their dawgs - if you must
violate one of their famous franks
with the goopy red stuff, they'll
give you a packet of it and you can
apply it yourself.
Now if New York and Chicago,
whose hot dog rivalry is the stuff
of legends, independently issue
damning indictments of ketchup,
then that should be a pretty good
indicator of how universally
hated ketchup is by wiener enthu-
siasts. But this universal hatred is
precisely whatis so weird about
ketchup-phobia. When some
variation of a common food is
disliked in one region, it's usually
chalked up to differenceswith
other regions, a sort of "we don't
do 'x,' that's what those other
people do." But as far as I know,
no one puts ketchup on ahot
dog, or should I say, no region
prescribes it. It's as if people
in Boston, New York, Chicago,
Detroit, Los Angeles and pretty
much everywhere else have
created this imaginary region
where everyone slathers their
poor, innocent hot dogs with
evil ketchup.
And since I'm pretty sure
that this Democratic Republic
of Ketchup doesn't exist, we're
left to assume that ketchup on a
hot dog is hated because it's an
intuitively disgusting food pair-
ing, like cinnamon in spaghetti
sauce or blue cheese with choc-
olate syrup. But is it really that
intuitive? Look at the ingre-
dients of the typical hot dog:
ground beef, water, spices and
some preservatives. Look at the
ingredients of ketchup: tomato,
vinegar, sugar and spices. Does
that really sound like such a
bad combination? If it does,
then hamburgers with ketchup
should be disgusting, not to
mention stewed tomatoes and

onions on a hot dog, aila NYC.
Now, I should probably men-
tion at this point that I don't
put ketchup on my hot dogs.
However, I don't put ketchup
on anything, because I hate the
taste of ketchup. I don't put it
on burgers, fries, eggs, corned-
beef hash or anything else. I
just think that in the interest of
honesty, the irrational prohibi-
tion against ketchup on hot dogs
should be exposed for what it is:
an invented rule, proclaimed for
so long, by so many people that
it has become an unimpeach-
able fact. It's as if in Leviticus,
in between the prohibitions
against cloven hooves and mix-
ing fibers, there is a passage
which states "Thou shalt not put
ketchup on thine frankfurter,
for it is an abomination."
So if the "no ketchup on ahot
dog" thing is a fabricated rule,
why was it fabricated in the first
place? Why does Dirty Harry in
"Sudden Impact" tell a detective
that it's not the rampant crime
and corruption that get to him,
it's really "watching you stuff
your face with those hot dogs.
Nobody, I mean NOBODY puts
ketchup on a hot dog."? Why
does Anthony Bourdain, when
guiding a reader to Papaya King
in Manhattan, warn that "if you
put ketchup on your hot dog I
will fucking kill you."?
It's all a sort of elitism. Hav-
ing defined dislikes is often con-
sidered a sign of one's depth of
knowledge. By stating that you
hate country music, you give off
the impression that you know
enough about music to know
what you do and don't like. It's
the same with ketchup.By stat-
ing that putting it on a hot dog is
wrong, you place yourself in this
imaginary in-group of people
who know so much about food
that they are the protectors of
all things proper. But when you
really examine this unques-
tioned rule, you'll realize that
not only does it not make any
sense, but that it also requires
zero knowledge or passion to
adopt. So if you want to, put
ketchup on your hot dog. Deep
down, no one really cares.

Juicy J's voice is instantly rec-

Literacy
missions are
vital

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Literary Columnist
L ast Monday was
significant for quite
a few reasons. For
many of us it marked our first
Monday classes of the semes-
ter. For some of us it may also
have marked the first classes
of the year we attended hun-
gover. No judgment, it was a
rough weekend to be a Wol-
verine.
And for others, includ-
ing myself, we went to check
our Tumblr and learned that
Monday also marked the UN's
annual International Literacy
Day.
The United Nations Edu-
cational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization first
proclaimed Sept. 8 as Inter-
national Literacy Day in 1965.
Since then, UNESCO and
other partners have worked
together to advocate globally
for the importance of literacy
to individuals, communities
and society as a whole. The
critical point of UNESCO's
mission with International
Literacy Day is that literacy is
a human right and a basis of
education.
According to UNESCO,
some 781 million adults are
illiterate. That's nearly 16
percent of the world's popu-
lation. Women make up 64
percent of the adult illiterate
population, and those liv-
ing in conflict-affected areas
face even greater barriers to
education. Poor literacy rates
are'directly connected with
increased levels of severe
poverty, poor health outcomes
and prejudice against women.
Even within the United
States the numbers don't look
good. According to a 2013
study by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education and the
National Institute of Literacy,
32 million adults in the United
States, or 14 percent of the
population, demonstrate a
"below basic" literacy level.
Internationally and domes-
tically, the benefits of literacy
are vast. For example, literate
individuals are more likely to
participate in the democratic
process, contribute to sustain-
able economies and advocate
for better healthcare and
education opportunities for
themselves and their chil-
dren.
While the numbers paint a
disturbingly clear picture of
just how much is at stake, they
don't quite express the heart
of the issue. To be illiterate
is to be disenfranchised from
one of the most powerful
forms of imaginati6n. It is to

be denied the critical think-
ing and comprehension skills
that enable one to make sense
of the world and one's place
within it. It makes language a
prison when it should in fact
be a site of transformation, of
transcendence.
In "A Dance With Drag-
ons," George R.R. Martin
writes, "A reader lives a thou-
sand lives before he dies. The
man who never reads lives
only one." Books can fill our
lives with so much more:
more time, more color, more
intensity. Think of your favor-
ite book. Think of the places,
the characters and the emo-
tions. Now imagine that you
had never read that book, that
you couldn't read that book.
It's like a piece of you would
be missing.
Who would I be if I never
fought against the Dark Lord
with Harry?
How else could I take a
turn about a regency ballroom
and trade witty barbs with a
handsome gentleman?
How would I know about
the rolling green hill of
Hobbiton, the underground
Dwarven city of Moria, or the
white city of Minas Tirith?
Shakespeare, Dickens, Tol-
stoy... the list goes on and on
with authors and works that
have not only delighted and
entertained me, but chal-
lenged me and profoundly
informed who I am today.
I can't imagine my life
without being able to read a
good book and I don't think
anyone else should have to live
without being able to either.
And I'm not alone. Countless
writers, including Margaret
Atwood, Toni Morrison and
Amy Tan, have all contributed
to UNESCO's literary mission
to promote the importance
of the written word and the
power of a literate society.
International Literacy Day
may have already passed this
year, but there's still plenty
you can do to make a dif-
ference. I encourage you to
donate your time or your
money to literacy outreach
programs, like the Residential
College's partnership with
Telling It, a children's literacy
community service program.
You can be sure that your
efforts will go toward improv-
ing someone's quality of life.
And remember just how lucky
you are the next time you
crack open a book.
Prosniewski is thankful for books.

From Page 1B
"(By 1964), people said 'I like
this director, I like this star, I
like this type of movie, I'm going
to go to that movie,'"he said.
Intense competition from
other Ann Arbor theaters,
though - along with a declining
quality in Hollywood films
- meant that by the '70s
the Michigan Theater was
struggling. With the building
itself also needing some serious
repair, and the Power Center
less than10 years old, many were
advocating tearing it down and
replacing it with a food court or
a shopping mall.
"When things get to be 30
years old, they don't tend to be
thought of as historic, they're
just thought of as old." Collins
said.
Despite a downturn in
the economy, a group of Ann
Arborites including Henry
Aldridge, then-mayor Lou
Belcher and key donor Margaret
D. Towsley helped gather
support for the nonprofit
Michigan Theater Foundation.
But while they were able to save
the Theater, they still needed
somebody to run it.
Enter Russ Collins in 1982. At
just 26 years old, the Ann Arbor
native was fresh out of graduate
school at the University with a
Master'sin Theater Management
(a program that no longer exists
at the University). Back in the
baby-boomer decades, there
was a vibrant film culture on
the University's campus, where
student film clubs would host
screenings of a diverse selection
of movies for other students to
enjoy.
"It seemed like you'd go watch
a movie at every building at some
point during the semester," said
ScottBultman, aFilm/Video and
Music composition double major
who attended the University in
the'80s.
The. success of screenwriter
and University graduate
Lawrence Kasdan told students
that Hollywood success was
possible, but at the same time,
a culture of experimental films
also thrived.
"We all had Super 8 cameras
and went out and did a lot of
experimental work and then
come back to wind them up
into the projector and watch
them," Bultman said. "A lot of
people were doing some really
interesting kinds of things,
drawing on film and stop-
motion animation. You were
at a big university and there
were obviously Hollywood
connections, but at the same
time you really felt like you were
doing these really low-level film
projects."
"It was a real postwar passion
of students," Collins said. "It was
before the Internet, and these
foreign films, documentary
films and classic films were
considered alternative media. In
much the way that students are
passionate about the alternative
media they can get over the
Internet, students back in the
'50s, '60s, '70s and into the '80s
were passionate about cinema."

This pre-Internet, intense
film culture was centered on
hard-to-get, non-commercial
movies. Out of 50 people who
applied for the CEO job in 1982,
it was Collins who was hired and
faced the difficult task of piloting
the nonprofit into a new era.
"It was exciting and daunting.
I was 26 years old, so on one level
I knew everything in the world,"
he laughed. "Butin reality Ihad a
lot to learn. So that was scary, but
in a good way."
It's Friday, Aug. 1, 2014.
"Boyhood" is playing at the
Michigan Theater on its opening
night in Ann Arbor. The 7:00
showing is sold out (probably
because it's in the smaller, newer
screening room instead of the
main theater), but there are still
seats available in the regular
theater for the 8:00 show. The
audience is pure Ann Arbor
- a well-dressed collection of
people from all age groups, who
look like they spend their days
listening to NPR and chatting
about literature in coffee shops.
Not only the main floor, but
even the balcony has a fair
share of excited moviegoers.
They listen to a young man on
stage talk about the theater and
thank them for coming, discuss
among themselves which of the

'U' alumn Russ Collins took over as CEO of The Michigan Theater in 1982.

previews seem worth seeing,
and then they sit back in their
chairs as the opening chords of
Coldplay's "Yellow" plays over a
blue-sky backdrop, signaling the
start of the film.
The incredible, nostalgic
movie - potentially one that
will join the ranks of many
now-classic films to have had
their main Ann Arbor runs at
the Michigan - is in part about
noticing the subtle changes
as things get older, but the
Michigan Theater today looks
as pristine as it did in 1930.
Bathed in the golden glow of the
walls and ceiling, everything
from the concession stand to
the drinking fountains seems
to take on a greater historical
importance. Everything from
the towering staircases that
lead up to the balcony to the
ticket booth out front has been
designed to meet pre-remodeling
specifications. According to the
book "The Michigan Theater" by
Henry Aldridge, the much more
modern-lookingScreeningRoom
in the annex was added in 1999.
When production companies like
Miramax became frustrated at
live events'interrupting the runs
of popular independent movies,
generous gifts, grants and a fifty-
cent surcharge on tickets helped
fund the new room.
In addition to first-run art
house movies, the Michigan
Theater is the setting for year-
round live events and special
film series. For the theater's
entire history, even before
the renovations, the place has
attracted top national talent -
particularly the ones with large
followings in college towns. Iggy
Pop, Journey, The Replacements,
Gil Scott-Heron, R.E.M., The
Police and King Sunny Ad6 all
played here, as well as current
indie acts like Death Cab for
Cutie and Bright Eyes, and
experienced, respected legends
like Elvis Costello and David
Byrne.
While the 1,700-seat theater
doesn't have a bar and can't
accommodate standing general
admission like Detroit venues
such as The Fillmore, it's still
an attractive place for artists in
between the club- and arena-
show levels.
"Artists like playing (in Ann
Arbor) because the audiences are
very receptive and smart about
what they see," Collins said.
"They tend to be better informed
than your average audiences and
more appreciative of artists of a
certain caliber. And that can be
old-fashioned classical artists, or
it can be contemporary artists."
Besides the musical acts, the
theater also has run regular
film series, which deal with
a wide variety of topics from
live music accompanying silent
films to Hitchcock to Martin
Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces
of Polish Cinema and the
Science on Screen series. It even
had a Valentine's Day .sing-a-
long presentation of R. Kelly's
"Trapped in the Closet" hip-
hopera.
Events unique to the Ann
Arborscommunity populate
the schedule, as the Michigan
Theater is home to the Ann

Arbor Film Festival, which is the
longest-running experimental
film festival in the country.
Because there's no international
film festival in Detroit, the
theater also worked with the
DIA, the University and other
t partners to pitt on the Cinetopia
festival. This summer, the third

year of the festival, saw a 25th
anniversary screening of "Do
the Right Thing," hosted by
Spike Lee himself. On top of
all of this, the Michigan runs
a national conference for art
houses in association with
the Sundance Institute called
the Art House Convergence,
cementing its reputation as a
top-notch cinema and creating a
nationwide network of cutting-
edge art house theaters that can
exchange ideas.
The next step for the Michigan
Theater actually involves the
theater across the street. Last
summer, the Michigan Theater
Foundation purchased the State
Theatre, which lies just a few
steps away on State Street. The
closing of the Ann Arbor Forum
- previously the top art house
in the city - when its owners
built Quality 16 in 1998 left the
State and the Michigan as the
only two theaters in downtown
Ann Arbor. The main floor
of the State, which has been
around nearly as long as the
Michigan Theater, was turned
into Urban Outfitters by Tom
Borders in 1989, but the former
balcony remains as a two-screen
theater. While the Michigan
has partnered with the State in
selecting and marketing films
since 1999, now there's a chance
to make real improvements
to a theater that isn't even
handicapped-accessible yet. No
immediate improvements will
be made without approval from
the community, but Collins
hopes that the remodeling work
will be done in time to celebrate
the State's 75th anniversary in
March 2017.
Despite media articles that
constantly depict the movie
industry as one on the edge of a
cliff, ready to free fall, Collins is
adamant that the business he's in
is a stable one. Since TV became
ubiquitous in the '60s, movie
attendance has been trending
slightly upwards. There are ups
and downs, and in 1988, when
everybodybought a VCR, Collins
said "business went to hell,"
but in '89 and '90 the receipts
rebounded. Online streaming
doesn't worry himeither, andhe
said that increased accessibility
in the Internet age has actually
made for more informed movie
watchers, and even though
everything is available at home
nowadays, people still enjoy the
experience of going out to the
cinema.
The theater also has
something unique to offer at
many of its evening movies: the
Historic Barton Theatre Pipe
Organ, which has been at the
Michigan since its 1927 and is
today one of the-few of its kind
still in its original location. Still
in excellent condition (though
at the moment undergoing
maintenance), talented
organists entertain Ann Arbor
audiences before films and give
them a rare taste of what going
to the movies was like when the
pictures were still black and
white. Credit the passionate
work of Henry Aldridge and a

group of organ enthusiasts for
repairing the organ and saving
it from destruction in the '70s.
"In 1970, about half of (the
organ) didn't work," said
Aldridge, organ curator and
recently-retired film studies
professor at Eastern Michigan
University. "So we got a bunch

of people together, and we
would meet down there on
Sunday mornings, and we took
everything apart and cleaned
it up and resoldered wires and
put things back together, and
got it going in about a year."
The organ was originally
meant to accompany silent
films, but was played regularly
until 1950. After the restoration
and repair, the organ has been
played regularly before evening
films and lectures, with four
different organists on staff to
playthe demandinginstrument.
The Barton Organ is a
special attraction that always
impresses theatergoers. "The
fact that we have this beautiful
instrument and the fact that
people are playing it regularly
tells patrons that somebody
really cares about the Michigan
Theater," Aldridge said.
The theater also receives
financial help from its donors
- a base of 4,000 members
who (including their families)
Collins said represent around
10,000 people. 40 percent of
its budget, the part that doesn't
come from ticket sales, come
from these dnots. Whfn
fundraising, Collins said,
"you not only have to ask in a
compelling way, but you also
have to prove that what you're
doing is valuable."
Under his tenure, the theater
has striven to showcase its
connection and value to
the community, and Ann
Arborites have responded with
contributions that have led to
impressive tangible results.
When you're confident and
have a good relationship with
the community, "it's really kind
of magical the way people will
support you."
"The Michigan was
not built for today only,"
a booklet available at the
Bentley Historical Library
commemorating the theater's
openingreads, "butconstructed
in the hopes that it might be a
monument for years to come
and a credit to the community
even when the city is many
times its present size."
Back in 1928, it was easy to
read those words as empty
rhetoric, but today, they
seem oddly prescient. While
it has undergone changes
over time, 80 years later the
Michigan Theater still fulfills
its intended purpose, and
then some. The famous pipe
organ remains in its original
location, the movies are still
shown in a gorgeous setting
and the community supports
the programs that the non-
profit coordinates.
Collins attributes the
popularity of the many
programs offered and the
continued resilience of the
Michigan to the tastes of the
town.
"(Ann Arbor) is a town that's
genuinely interested in the
arts,and whether it's cinema or
whether it's music, or theater
or dance, there's a genuine
interest in the population," he

said. "So consequently, you're
always pushed ... the very smart
people that are attracted to this
town, they're alwayspushingyou
to say 'What about this? What
about this? What newinteresting
programs are you going to do
next? I like this one but what are
you going to do next?"'

LSA junior De'Mario Longmire is the co-Music Director of the Angels on Call a cappella group.
the es a

should expect to sing for hospital
patients as often as for undergrad
crowds, it's crucial that they are in
it for more than just achance to sing.
During the first round of
auditions, prospective members are
asked to sing scales - working their
way to their highest and lowest
notes so the board can determine
range. Then, theysight-read a piece
ofmusic andsingaverse and chorus
of the song of their choosing. This
is standard procedure for many
seasoned singers, but the Angels
also encourage unscheduled walk-
in auditions from performers who
might not have as much formal
experience. LSA sophomore
Augusto Costa walked by the
sign-in table, guitar in hand after
an impromptu performance with
friends, when he was asked if he
knew how to sing. Costa had been
planning to rush a few a cappella
groups, but the Angels weren't
really on his radar until he walked
by Au Bon Pain and just "took the
opportunity." Though he didn't
have a chance to prepare for his
audition and confesses that his
sight-reading skills aren't strong,
Costa isn't nervous about how his
audition went.
"So what if they didn't like me?"
he shrugs. "So that'sit."
Another auditioner, Engineering
freshman Sophia Sproul, said the
thing that stands out most about
Angels on Call to her is the group's
community service work (or as
she so beautifully stated it, "the
opportunity to fill people's hearts'
with joy.") Angels on Call is her
favorite of the eight a cappella
groups.she's auditioningfor,but she
didn't lether nervesgetinthe wayof
showcasing hertalent.
"I'm a freshman, I have room to
fail, time to try again, so t'm not too
worried,"she said.
Sproul also cited the refreshingly
friendly attitude of the group for
a successful audition (And the
admiration must have been mutual,
because Sproul was called back for
a second audition a few days later).
Music, Theatre & Dance
freshman Hanna Rumora is also
enthusiastic about her chance to
join Angels on Call, and says that
she's "really into the outreach side
of music." A trained cellist, Rumora
has done many auditions before,
but said that her experience with
Angels has been one of her more

easygoing audition experiences.
The hardest part for her was picking
a song to showcase her talent (she
went with "King of Anything" by
Sara Bareilles). Though Rumora
humbly described her performance
as having gone "fairly well," she
wowed the board enough to earn a
callback spot. Her goals in joining
an a cappella group, whether or not
she eventually decides to heed the
call of the Angels, are to "go enjoy
(herself), and maybe make some
friends,too."
Though it isn't advertised on
their website or written on a club
manifesto, another crucial aspect
ofthe Angels' DNA is their tightknit
and supportive community. While
the first round of auditions is
primarily used to judge singing
ability, the callback phase is
crucial to determining whether an
auditioner's personality meshes
well with the Angels as a whole.
LSA junior De'Mario Longmire,
another Angels board member,
boils the criteria down to "people
who love to sing, but also love to do
charity work, but also are chill and
relaxed and know how to have fun."
At callbacks, potential Angels
were split into sectionals, in which
they worked with other singers in
their category (e.g., altos). Board
members watch especially closely
for good teamwork skills, as these
groups would be the ones with
which Angels spend much of their
time rehearsing. At the end, the
entire group reconvened to sing
"Lucky" by Jason Mraz and Colbie
Caillat, and auditioners' ability to
harmonize with their peers was
put to the test. This was also an
opportunity for the board to see if
auditioners are "musical people," as
Leung put it, and can do something
unique with the sample piece of
music they're given.
The Angel newbies "lucky"
enough to be called back already
possessed that characteristic
Angels camaraderie. Before
callbacks officially began, Sproul
and the 11 other auditioners relaxed
in a hallway in the Union. They
asked each other their majors and
years in school, making small talk
and engaging with the competition.
Though the auditioners were
competing for the same spots,
there's no bad blood. Sproul
reiterated that the group is "so
friendly and welcoming," but she

might as well be talking about the
little community that's begun to
form outside the callback room,
all smiles and shaking hands and
borrowed pens.
The current members of Angels
on Call take extra care to make
sure the whole process is easy on
those who apply. An estimated 100
people auditioned to join Angels on
Call, but only 15 were called back,
and likely only 10 of those will
actually be offered a spot in the
group. The competition is tough,
but the applicants aren't feeling the
pressure. Music, Theatre & Dance
freshman Kat Ward is auditioning.
for six other a cappella groups,
but appreciated that the Angels in
particular handled the inevitable
competition with grace: "I believe
that they just really want you to
do well." LSA sophomore Sarrah
Hakim confesses that this is "really
(her) first audition, since (she
hasn't) done these kind of things
before."Hakimwas anxious priorto
her walk-in audition, but her nerves
quickly dissipated with the Angels'
smiles and warm reception.
"It's been really nice. I don't feel
as nervous as I thought I would,"
she said as she walked away -
visibly relieved and proud of her
accomplishment.
Though Angels on Call doesn't
decide which auditioners will be
offered spots in their group until
later this week (and potential
Angels are given a grace period to
decide whether they'd like to join
a different a cappella group), the
hardest part of the deliberation is
over. The remaining contenders
all have the singing chops and
philanthropic goals to be Angels in
full, and all it comes down to is the
politics of how well the auditioners
fit into their respective sections.
But ultimately, Angels on Call isn't
just a club -, it's a community of
warmheartedandcharitablepeople
wholoveto"singgoodanddogood,"
as Longmire so aptly puts it. Even
those potential Angels who didn't
get their wings and auditioners
who weren't calledback don'tleave
empty-handed, as theyhavehad the
invaluable experience of putting
themselves out there and trying
somethingascary.
Auditions don't always end in
acceptance, but the simple hope of
joiningsomethingspecial isenough
to keepdiese Angels singini.
