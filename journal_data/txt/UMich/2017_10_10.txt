In response to recent racist 

events on campus such as 
the racist graffiti in West 
Quad Residence Hall and the 
“Make America White Again” 
posters found near Stockwell 
Residence Hall last week, the 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs and 
University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

met Monday to discuss how 
administration and faculty 
can respond to discrimination 
on 
campus 
afternoon. 

Schlissel also updated SACUA 
on the progress of the official 
request to rename the C.C. 
Little Science Building.

Prior 
to 
Schlissel’s 

appearance at the meeting, 
David Potter, a Greek and 
Latin professor in LSA and 
Student Relations Advisory 
Committee chair, summarized 
a meeting with SACUA Chair 
Robert Ortega, the Student 
Relations Advisory Council 
and 
members 
of 
Central 

Student Government on the 
current campus climate.

In this meeting, the CSG 

representatives 
suggested 

ways to systematically combat 
racist 
incidents, 
including 

statements 
addressing 

the lack of penalties for 
threatening conduct based on 
racial bias, a training program 
for all incoming students on 
living in a racially diverse 

community and a statement 
reminding 
faculty 
of 
the 

impact of student biases.

In his opening remarks, 

Schlissel 
mentioned 
the 

difficulty 
of 
releasing 

statements 
in 
response 

to 
acts 
of 
discrimination 

on campus. He said he is 
often criticized whether he 
releases a statement every 
time discrimination occurs 
publicly or if he can’t manage 

to get a statement out quickly 
enough for the student body.

Kinesiology 
professor 

Stefan 
Szymanski 
said 

Schlissel’s 
statements 

represent the administration’s 
stance on these issues and 
events as well as the faculty’s. 
He said even if some students 
believe the statements are too 
constant and lack urgency, 
Schlissel should continue to 
respond.

“Even at the risk of (the 

statements) becoming banal, 
what’s 
the 
alternative?” 

Szymanski 
said. 
“These 

are terrible times to live 
in. … Certainly I think you 
need to carry on (with the 
statements).”

Schlissel and many SACUA 

members 
reaffirmed 
the 

difficulty 
of 
responding 

to 
crises.

Monday 

to demand the school take 
more steps to respect Native 
Americans and acknowledge 
its tenuous history in the first 
year of Ann Arbor’s official 
recognition

Earlier this year, Central 

Student Government passed 
a

the University to recognize

Five 
startups 
focused 

on 
autonomous 
vehicle 

technology will be partnering 
with 
Mcity 
to 
accelerate 

their progress in the race for 
driverless cars. TechLab, an 
initiative from the University 
of 
Michigan 
College 
of 

Engineering’s 
Center 
for 

Entrepreneurship, 
allows 

students to register for an 
independent 
study 
course 

and work with one of the 
“companies in residence.”

The 
Center’s 
executive 

director, Jonathan Fay, laid 
out the criteria for picking the 
five companies.

“We tried to get a cross 

section of different companies 
from across the autonomous 
ecosystem,” Fay said. “So we 
didn’t want all the companies 
doing similar type of work. 
Tome for example, we thought 
it was really important to have 
a company that was actually 
close to home so a Detroit, 

Southeast Michigan company. 
In addition, we wanted to 
pick companies where we 
could identify a project that 
matched the interest of our 
students.”

TechLab offers students 

an alternative to traditional 
co-op programs or internships 
because it is an independent 
study class students receive 
credit for. Fay said though 
different, TechLab is no less 
enterprising.

“We’ve 
seen 
students 

get 
paid 
internships 
over 

the summer and students 
likely getting hired by these 
companies,” he added.

Mcity 
and 
TechLab 

function as a partnership, 
where Mcity allows TechLab 
companies to use its facilities 
like the state-of-the-art test 
track.

Panel of “joy soldiers” demonstrate yoga, meditation and positive psychology

Center for Yoga instructor 

Kara Baruzzini sat cross-legged 
and barefoot in the middle of 
the stage calling the attendees 
of Head Talks — part of the 
University of Michigan’s first 
ever mental health week — to 
breathe, an introduction that 
set the tone for the evening’s 
event. Students attended this 
Ted Talk-style panel at the 
Ross School of Business, aiming 

to explore a variety of ways in 
which 
mindfulness, 
mental 

health and positive psychology 
manifest 
in 
the 
workplace, 

classroom and everyday life.

The 
seven-person 
panel, 

made up of “joy soldiers,” was 
designed to be an outlet for 
professors, University students, 
Ann Arbor community members 
and business leaders to convene 
and have a conversation mental 
health.

Business senior Sarah Wood, 

who coordinated the event, 
explained the meaning of “joy 

soldiers” as a term she uses to 
name her life’s purpose.

“You’re 
not 
a 
therapist,” 

Wood said. “You are trying to 
alleviate pain and bring joy to 
the people around you. To be 
a good ‘joy soldier’ you need to 
take care of yourself and I think 
that taking care of yourself first 
allows you to help others.”

Each speaker drew attention 

to a different way in which 
mindfulness affects their life.

“You never know when that 

moment of grace is going to 
come and so this Head Talks 

idea came from the thought 
that you never know what’s 
going to click with someone,” 
Wood said. “I know all these 
amazing ‘joy soldiers’ could 
come together and make an 
impact.”

Bryan 
Bennett, 
a 
yoga 

instructor at Center for Yoga,

his talk on being present for the 
journey of life.

LSA Student Government 

kicked off its Mental Health 
Week Monday afternoon 
by gathering student 
organizations focused on 
mental health for a Diag Day.

At the far end of the Diag, 

LSA SG representatives Eli 
Rachlin, an LSA junior, and 
Kristen Ball, an LSA senior, 
blew bubbles and blasted music 
as students walked by.

Rachlin, spouting 

positive encouragement to 
passersby said the Diag Day 
is an important part of the 
Awareness Week because of 
its ability to reach so many 
students.

“You got to do something 

where you get exposure … 
everyone’s down this week, it’s 
right before fall break, there 
are probably a lot of midterms, 
whatever it is — also the game 
result,” Rachlin said. “But it’s 
really important to get out 
there to people who are maybe 
very stuck in their own path, 
or whatever’s going on in the 
day, and say: ‘Hey, be happy! 
Do something that makes you 
feel good!’ and just try to take 
some stress out of your life.”

LSA SG has been planning 

the week since last year’s 
winter semester, which will 
also include events like yoga 
in the Michigan Union, panels 

discussing mental health 
awareness and the annual 
Send Silence Packing event, 
where hundreds of backpacks 
will be laid on the Diag to 
encourage discussion about 
suicide prevention. LSA junior 
Nick Meier, chair of LSA SG’s 
Mental Health Task Force, 
wrote in an email interview he 
finds the topic of mental health 
on campus to be extremely 
important and not discussed 
enough.

“I’ve seen the effects of the 

poor mental health up front,” 
he wrote. “I’ve had friends 
attempt suicide, fail tests due 
to depression, and been hurt 
by anxiety. UofM is one of the 
most stressed campuses in 
Michigan. Long-term stress 
can lead to depression and 
subsequently suicide. We 
can’t stand idly by and excuse 
systematic anxiety.”

Meier said he knew there 

needed to be more dialogue 
about mental health on 
campus after an eye-opening 
discussion with University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel.

“(A)t a Fireside Chat, I 

had the opportunity to talk 
to President Schlissel about 
mental health,” Meier wrote.

University Council explores policy 
to protect targets of bias incidents

Agenda items include academic extensions, ME/NA box and course evaluations

The 
University 
Council 

convened Tuesday evening in 
the Michigan Union to discuss 
topics 
such 
as 
documenting 

student racial categories and 
the possibility of a resolution to 
academically protect students 
targeted by racist incidents.

To 
begin 
the 
meeting, 

guest speaker Jad Elharake, 
an LSA senior, presented an 
initiative to the council calling 
for all University documents 
and applications to include a 
racial category checkbox for 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 

students who identify as Middle 
Eastern / North African. He 
explained the state of Michigan, 
outside of the Middle East, has 
the 
largest 
concentration 
of 

Middle Eastern / North African 

individuals. In working with 
faculty and staff from the Ann 
Arbor and Dearborn campuses 
of the University, Elharake hopes 
those who identify as ME/NA 
individuals will no longer be 
included in the “white” category 
on University documents.

“Those who can identify with 

the category include the 22 Arab 
countries and the three non-
Arab countries that may identify 
because of regional purposes,” 
Elharake 
said. 
“That 
also 

includes communities that don’t 
have nationalities … just so that 
we’re more inclusive and we’re 
not creating an Arab box.”

CSG Vice President Nadine 

Jawad, a Public Policy senior, 
expressed her support of the 
initiative, one that has been 
promoted for several years within 
Central 
Student 
Government. 

Last year, CSG unanimously 
passed a resolution supporting 
the initiative. Jawad highlighted 

problems 
of 
unsustainable 

discussion 
within 
student 

governments.

“I 
think 
right 
now 
it’s 

especially relative because of the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
planning, there’s a large push, 
and I think that finally there’s 
a larger sense of urgency to the 
issue,” she said.

In discussion of the campus 

climate, Jawad introduced a 
resolution that would encourage 
a codified policy to protect the 
academic pursuits of students 
victim to bias incidents. She 
explained a hypothetical policy 
could, 
for 
instance, 
provide 

students who are targeted by a 
racist act during exam season 
with a few extra days to prepare.

“There’s so many ways you 

could write this policy,” she said. 
“I think just encouraging people 
to start having this conversation 
with something standardized in 
place should be the first step.”

While 
council 
members 

voiced their interest in the 
resolution, a common theme 
among members’ comments 
was ensuring the resolution 
be very specific, so as to avoid 
exploitation by those wishing 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
its 

protections.

Public Health Rep. Taylor 

Sullivan, a master’s student 
in Public Health, suggested 
such a policy could provide 
professors currently unsure of 
how to address racist incidents 
on campus with a concrete way 
to help their students directly 
affected by such acts.

“Maybe 
this 
is 
an 

opportunity somehow to talk to 
professors … and (explain) this 
is a way that you can actually 
make this inclusive, equitable 
environment,” she said.

Following 
discussion 

from council members, the 
resolution 
was 
tabled 
for 

further conversation at a future 
meeting.

an 
associate 
professor 
of 

accounting at the Ross School 
of Business, brought up the 
Leadership Crisis Challenge, 
a leadership simulation for 
Business students that puts 
students in the seat of a 
business leader or executive 
during a crisis of any kind. 
Students then must handle the 
crisis, talk to reporters and 
maintain their public persona. 
Wright said this program could 
be adapted for faculty to teach 
them how to respond to campus 
crises through their leadership 
positions at the University.

The 
posters 
found 
at 

Stockwell last week highlighted 
the low enrollment rates of Black 
students at the University and 
at Michigan State University, 
and 
connected 
these 
rates 

to alleged differences in IQ 
levels between Black and white 
students. A similar comparison 

was made last year when other 
racist flyers were found around 
campus. 
University 
faculty 

released a statement on the 
LSA 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Inclusion page debunking this 
relationship between race and 
intelligence.

Szymanski said a University-

wide statement from Schlissel 
regarding the faulty logic of 
these 
posters 
would 
show 

students 
the 
University 
is 

dedicated to combating racism 
through academics.

“A lot of research about race 

and race issues comes out of 
the University so I’m thinking 
of things of, in the scientific 
area, where there are a number 
of articles in recent years in 
the scientific journals pointing 
out that race is not a scientific 
category,” Szymanski said. “I 
think that’s something that our 
students often don’t understand 
and they need that pointed out 
to them and if it comes with the 
voice of their whole University, 
I think that’s a strong point.” 

Schlissel 
also 
responded 

to the suggestion of putting 
closed-circuit 
television 

cameras in the hallways of 

campus dorms to find the 
culprits 
behind 
any 
future 

racist acts like the graffiti in 
West Quad. He said cameras 
are already positioned at the 
entrances and exits of most 
residence halls but he said 
he’s wary of putting cameras 
in 
residence 
hall 
hallways 

because he wants to protect 
student privacy.

“Many 
things 
go 
on 
in 

dormitories that I think if 
students really thought about 
it, they’d prefer not to be on 
video,” Schlissel said.

Ortega replied to queries 

from students about why the 
University hasn’t caught any 
of the people committing these 
acts by saying victims must deal 
with the burden of continuing 
to interact the police and 
University administration until 
the perpetrators are caught.

“The extended period of time 

to pursue some of these matters, 
even when they know who the 
students are or they have some 
idea, it doesn’t erase the pain of 
the students who are victims of 
this and so there’s some sense 
on their part to do something 
more 
urgent,” 
Ortega 
said. 

“They’re set saying, ‘So where’s 
the justice for us as victims?’”

Schlissel went on to provide 

SACUA with an update on the 
proposed name changing of the 
C.C. Little Science Building. 
He said the formal request 
made last month is now being 
reviewed by the President’s 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University History.

The 
proposal 
is 
being 

compared 
to 
a 
rubric 
the 

committee 
developed 
last 

year for renaming University 
buildings. 
Some 
principles 

for 
name 
changes 
include 

respecting 
the 
University’s 

commitment to pedagogy and 
considering the original name 
within its historical context.

Schlissel said this second 

principle 
is 
important 
in 

the example of C.C. Little 
because of Little’s confirmed 
belief in eugenics, a method 
pseudoscience that promotes 
human 
progress 
through 

selective breeding.

“What (the name) meant 

to people 100 years ago or 80 
years ago might have been quite 
different than what it means 
now even if we’ve learned 
nothing over the interim but 
these two ideas of looking, 
in context, ‘Was this person 
representative of their times or 
were they, in some fashion an 
outlier, an extreme version of 
something that we would not 
want to be associated with,’” 
Schlissel said.

U.S. 
Secretary 
of 

Transportation, Elaine Cho, 
unveiled new guidelines for 
the testing site.

The 
Center’s 
marketing 

specialist, 
Jane 
Sugiyama, 

explained the scope of the 
student’s work at TechLab.

“The students are required 

to 
attend 
lecture 
that’s 

two hours once a week,” 
Sugiyama said. “In the first 
couple weeks they’re learning 

project management, business 
models, ecosystem mapping 
and basically all the tools that 
you would need to help launch 
a startup and create a valuable 
value 
proposition. 
Then 

later we bring in some guest 
speakers.”

Sugiyama 
detailed 
the 

experience 
and 
work 
that 

students are doing with Tome, 
the Detroit-based company.

“They’re going to be doing 

B-to-V 
testing 
which 
is 

bicycle-to-vehicle testing so 
the students will actually be 
doing the bicycle-to-vehicle 
detection out at Mcity on the 
test track,” she said. “The 

students are really engrained 
within the companies and 
treated 
just 
like 
a 
team 

member.”

The companies also test 

software and work on data sets 
that are less track-intensive, 
as 
track 
time 
at 
Mcity’s 

facility can be exclusive and 
expensive.

Though the innovations are 

important and applicable, Fay 
prioritizes the talent pipeline 
that is made up of TechLab’s 
students.

“(Google and Ford) could 

have 
great 
autonomous 

vehicles on the road, but 
what I really want is that 

machine 
learning 
company 

that supplies both of them to 
be here in Michigan,” Fay said.

Engineering 
junior 
Matt 

Jankowski 
spoke 
to 
the 

benefits and drawbacks of 
doing independent study work 
as opposed to a traditional 
co-op. He expressed his desire 
to work for mobility startups 
in the future.

“I think being in a co-op is 

still more of a real workplace 
experience because it shows 
you what working full time 
is like,” Jankowski said. “A 
work-study 
course 
doesn’t 

allow for that.”

possibly could.”

While a student at the 

University and student body 
president, 
Armstrong 
was 

subject of an anti-gay blog, run 
by then-Michigan Assistant 
Attorney 
General 
Andrew 

Shirvell, 
which 
defamed 

Armstrong.

“Me and my community, 

we 
were 
suddenly 
being 

tested with this outing — 
where people were finding 
themselves having to interact 
with being outed,” Armstrong 
said. “And that power and 
privilege of coming out (being) 
taken away from them.” 

Following 
the 
keynote 

speech, 
five 
students 

and alumni of the LGBT 
community, 
including 

Armstrong, gathered for a 
panel discussing coming out, 
allies and intersections of 
identities.

LSA freshman Juan Orozco 

was interested in the discussion 
of different identities and the 
representation of each as a 
Latino student.

“The intersectionality from 

being a brown person and also 
being queer was kind of cool to 
see,” Orozco said.

University 
alum 
Steph 

Parrish, who uses gender-
neutral pronouns, discussed 
coming out and realizing their 
sexuality. 
Parrish 
realized 

they weren’t like the rest of 
their soccer team when they 
began to realize they were 
attracted to the girls on the 
team.

“I’ve always kind of known 

I was different, to use the 
cliche, both with my gender 
and my attractionality, but it 
really wasn’t until the very end 
of high school that I started to 
realize that there were words 
and language out there for 
people like me,” Parrish said. 
“I came to realize, wow I 
have a crush on half my team. 
That’s awkward. But I started 
to realize that’s a thing, that’s 
OK.”

The panelists talked about 

people who have supported 
them in their coming out, 

which varied from friends to 
parents to siblings. University 
alum S. Kerene Moore spoke 
about her sister, who is also 
gay, and how she helped her 
come out, especially when it 
came to their parents.

“It’s still important to me 

today to have this older sister 
that I can call and clear things 
with or talk to my parents 
for me because I’m not good 
with that,” Moore said. “And 
you know, I come from a very 
Christian household and I 
was actually president of my 
high school Christian club 
... but I still can’t have those 
conversations with my parents 
that she can because she’s 
just older and more willing to 
stand up to them.”

established 
through 
the 

removal of Potawatomi people 
from this land and the treaty 
of Fort Meigs, as well as the 
establishment of the U of M 
Biological Station, which was 
established subsequent to the 
burning of an Ottawa village 
in Burt Lake by the County 
Sheriff,” 
MInode’e 
said. 

“Several people died, and that 
happened in 1902 and the bio 
station was established in 1907. 
So we went to different points 
around campus and discussed 
their historical significance.”

The 
march 
stopped 
at 

the School for Environment 
and Sustainability, a plaque 
commemorating 
the 
Native 

American “land gift,” and the 
Michigan Union, to discuss 
Michigamua — now known as 
the Order of Angell — a senior 
honor society that came under 
fire for appropriating Native 
artifacts and rituals.

The other goal of the march 

was to articulate demands 
towards 
the 
University 

regarding 
their 
treatment 

of 
the 
Native 
American 

community, which makes up 
0.8 percent of the student 

body. 

“The treaty of Fort Meigs, 

which established the land on 
which this University sits, has 
a clause in it that guarantees 
education for Native American 
youth,” MInode’e said. “So 
our 
concern 
is 
increasing 

American Indian enrollment, 
and we want the University 
to establish a position in 
admissions or another relevant 
department 
to 
work 
with 

tribal communities, schools 
and colleges in order to recruit 
and retain Native American 

students.”

MInode’e also said a goal 

of the march was to build 
up the community of both 
Native 
American 
students 

and people of color more 
broadly. To accomplish this, 
they 
reiterated 
Students 

for 
Justice’s 
demand 
the 

University establish a Central 
Campus multicultural center.

Issa, who was instrumental 

in the passing of the CSG 
resolution, said she found the 
demands of today’s march very 
reasonable.

“The 
University 
of 

Michigan prides itself on being 
inclusive and making people 
feel welcome, and if these 
demands can be met, as long 
as they’re not hurting other 
people, then why not?” Issa 
asked. “There’s a bad history 
there, and if the U of M can 
do its part in sort of helping 
indigenous students feel more 
welcome, then I think this is a 
great thing. I think this is an 
amazing initiative.”

MInode’e said he found the 

march today to be an uplifting 
experience 
and 
seemed 

optimistic for what the future 
held.

“I’ve been really humbled 

and amazed by how dedicated 
students are on this campus, 
particularly students of color, 
to fighting for justice and 
not settling for any less,” 
MInode’e said. “I think that 
it’s a beautiful thing when 
we support each other, and 
I’m really indebted to all the 
organizers who worked to 
make tonight a possibility. And 
I would encourage the rest of 
the student body to participate 
in 
civil 
disobedience 
and 

protest 
whenever 
possible, 

because it’s what makes our 
democracy 
worth 
fighting 

for.”

you want to go,” Bennett said. 
“The end goal doesn’t matter. 
What matters is that you put 
the effort in. Accept your past 
for what it is and don’t let it 
affect you in your current 
journey.”

In her speech, Business 

professor 
Amy 
Young 

mentioned an anecdote about 
a former student with a speech 
impediment who overcame his 
hurdle in a public speaking. 

Her story struck a chord 
with LSA sophomore Rachel 
Mazzotta.

“I thought that Professor 

Young’s 
presentation 
one 

of her student and how he 
fostered a sense of reimagining 
the 
possible 
even 
with 
a 

stutter,” Mazzotta said. “He 
really seems to have taught 
her more about her teaching 
abilities and touched everyone 
in his class.” 

Wrapping up the panel was 

Business senior Sam Orley, 
the 
executive 
director 
of 

Wolverine Support Network, 

who discussed how events in 
his personal life led him to get 
involved with mental health 
matters on campus.

“In 2013 as I was entering 

my senior year of high school, 
and my brother was a junior 
at Michigan, he took his life,” 
Orley said. “This is of course 
had 
a 
profound 
traumatic 

impact 
on 
my 
life 
both 

being with him and not. But 
experiencing from a distance 
his time at Michigan, and how 
his experience with mental 
illness was largely affected 
by the climate around him. 

It’s not that there weren’t 
people or outlets to get help 
— it’s just that he didn’t feel 
comfortable doing so. That’s 
why I’m here today, and that’s 
what motivated me to join 
Wolverine Support Network.”

Other speakers at the event 

included 
Patrick 
Borchert 

and Lars Gruss, exchange 
Ross 
MBA 
students 
from 

Copenhagen, 
and 
Mark 

St. 
George, 
principal 
at 

PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP and board member for 
National Alliance on Mental 
Illness.

“He said ... ‘I don’t see 
how many people can be 
depressed if all I see is smiling 
Wolverines.’ 
After 
hearing 

this disconnect between the 
University and the students, 
we decided we needed to host 
a week of events.”

According to Ball, chair 

of LSA SG’s Public Activities 
Committee, this is the second 
annual Mental Health Diag 
Day, but the first year an entire 
week has been scheduled to 
promote awareness.

“We felt like last year, 

when we would just do a 
single day, it wasn’t enough 
to increase the amount of 

awareness that we wanted to 
bring to mental health and 
positivity,” Ball said.

While 
Ball 
is 
excited 

about the other mental health 
awareness events, she said she 
loves the Diag Day because of 
the energy it brings to campus.

“Personally, 
I 
have 
a 

personal 
attachment 
to 

Mental 
Health 
Diag 
Day 

because I feel like it’s the 
most lively,” she said. “But 
I’m definitely excited for the 
City Health Forum that we 
have. We’re also going to be 
having a TEDx talk which is 
really exciting. But honestly, 
all of it’s great. As long as it’s 
celebrating 
mental 
health, 

that’s all that matters.”

Aside from LSA SG’s table, 

several other organizations 

had booths set up around the 
edges of the diag. LSA senior 
Emma Abed attended as a 
representative from CAPS in 
Action, the student-run mental 
health group connected to 
CAPS. The group, which is 
in its third year, wanted to 
let students know about its 
action-based 
programming 

and the support people can 
find within different mental 
health groups.

“We’re the only student 

mental health org on campus 
that has a direct connection to 
CAPS, which gives us a really 
unique position and a lot of 
different resources than other 
student orgs,” Abed said. “I 
hope that students learn that 
there are so many resources on 
campus and people that want 

to support them. So if they 
are struggling or they know 
people who are struggling, 
just learn who’s out there and 
who they can talk to.”

LSA sophomore Ammar 

Affan stopped by the CAPS in 
Action booth to learn about its 
workshops and mental health 
on campus. He said he thought 
the Diag Day was a good way 
to get the word out about 
mental health awareness.

“I’ve been studying since 

morning and I just needed a 
break and I think that mental 
health is pretty important 
so I just wanted to see what 
the University does,” Affan 
said. “We always talk about 
physical health but I guess it’s 
equally important because it’s 
still health, all in all.”

The debate about abortion 

often 
ignores 
that 
the 

procedure is primarily an issue 
of women’s health. Women 
compose less than 25 percent 
of the overall makeup of the 
House 
of 
Representatives. 

As such, the clear majority 
of people voting on the issue 
of abortion are not directly 
affected by their votes. This 
is particularly troubling given 
much of this vote fell along 
party lines — politicians were 
likely more motivated by party 
pandering than the wants and 
needs of their constituencies.

Though this bill would not 

affect the majority of women 
getting 
abortions 
— 
only 

about 2 percent of abortions 
are performed after 20 weeks 
of pregnancy — the passing 
of such a ban is an insidious 
attempt to add to the stigma 
regarding 
women 
who 
get 

abortions. It acts as a politically 
sanctioned 
mechanism 
to 

shame women who are making 
decisions 
based 
on 
their 

individual 
needs, 
whether 

they be medical, financial or 
personal. Additionally, passing 
introductory restrictions on 
abortion sets a precedent, only 
making it easier for stricter 
laws to be passed against it in 
the future.

And 
as 
many 
have 

pointed out, this bill would 
disproportionately 
hurt 

women who are already in the 
most 
vulnerable 
positions. 

It 
would 
overwhelmingly 

affect 
low-income 
women, 

who might have no choice but 
to wait longer than 20 weeks 
as they save up money to pay 
for the expensive procedure. 
Furthermore, many late-term 
abortions are performed for 
medical reasons, such as saving 
the life of the pregnant woman 
or 
terminating 
pregnancies 

that would result in stillbirth. 
Therefore, rendering abortion 
illegal after 20 weeks would 

not eliminate these abortions 
altogether. It would eliminate 
safe ways for women to have 
this procedure.

The bill also rests on the 

tenet that fetuses can feel pain 
at 20 weeks, thus claiming it 
is unethical to abort them. 
However, no sound scientific 
evidence 
currently 
exists 

to prove fetuses feel pain at 
this 
point 
in 
development. 

Basing a policy decision on 
the potential pain of a fetus is 
also entirely hypocritical. By 
solely considering the potential 
pain of the fetus, the argument 
neglects 
the 
emotional, 

psychological 
and 
physical 

pain the pregnant woman faces 
in making this decision and 
after the birth of the child. 
Furthermore, the same party 
tried many times this year to 
repeal the Affordable Care 
Act, which would perpetuate 
the 
pain 
of 
thousands 
of 

Americans by ridding them of 
their health care.

Thus, this bill not only serves 

to push aside women’s health 
rights, but also showcases the 
blatant disregard of definitive 
science to further political 
goals. Whereas conservative 
politicians are quick to dismiss 
climate 
change 
research 

as 
a 
partisan 
sham, 
they 

accept 
carefully 
selected, 

unsubstantiated 
medical 

“studies” that support more 
conservative 
anti-abortion 

ideals. 
Endorsing 
unclear 

scientific ideas solely because 
they align with their political 
end goals leads to hypocritical 
policy making, as well as 
policymaking that endangers 
public health.

Political 
maneuvers 
are 

being used to further the 
anti-abortion agenda with 
little regard to the women 
who are most affected by 
these decisions. Those who 
want a society focused more 
around anti-abortion values 
should instead be working to 
create and enforce programs 
that 
make 
it 
easier 
for 

women and families to be 
financially 
and 
medically 

stable, 
instead 
of 
taking 

away the choices of women.

A

s 
the 
kid 
of 

psychoanalysts, 
I’m 

often asked whether my 

parents analyzed me 
while I was growing 
up. And I don’t really 
know 
the 
answer 

to that question. I 
used to immediately, 
assuredly say, “No, of 
course not,” thinking 
that there was no 
way my parents saw 
me as they saw their 
patients. I was their 
youngest 
kid, 
their 

baby, not some confused, sad, lost 
person who paid for their service 
twice a week.

But as I’ve grown up I’ve 

recognized 
that, 
like 
any 

profession that our parents take 
on, it leaks into the rest of their 
lives. How could it not? Not 
surprisingly, this primarily took 
form in how my parents helped 
me deal with my own problems. 
They would have me simply talk 
about what was going on as a way 
of expressing myself, even when 
things 
seemed 
unfathomably, 

incomprehensibly confusing or 
sad — I was terrible at math, I 
was chubby and I was part of a 
friend group that bullied other 
kids. These, in addition to general 
adolescent dramas, were some of 
the things I’d be struggling with.

In other words, the idea was 

to share my mind with the rest of 
my family, to let them know what 
I was thinking. If I couldn’t do 
that, if things seemed too grave 
or too murky, I was taught that 
nothing really could be done to 
help my cause.

And now, thinking back on my 

childhood and the ways in which 
it has leaked into my own psyche 
today, I see, among all the beautiful 
and 
enriching 
experiences 

my 
childhood 
afforded 
me, 

that I struggle. I struggle to 
maintain privacy, to maintain a 
distance between myself and the 
surrounding world, potentially 
because of the emphasis that was 
placed on sharing my mind at 
home.

When I write things (plays, 

stories, 
columns, 
essays), 
I 

immediately feel the need to share 
what I’ve written. If I think the 

thing is good, somehow that 
doesn’t carry enough weight. I 
need the affirmation of other 

people. Often, this 
stunts my writing 
entirely, 
since 

before 
the 
thing 

I’ve written has any 
chance to breathe, 
before I can form any 
specific, 
intimate 

relationship 
with 

it, it is in somebody 
else’s hands, it has 
the marks of their 
critiques on it. I 

have endless writing projects 
waiting for me in my Google 
Drive, projects I know I’ll 
never return to, because the 
connection has been snapped 
by my insistent sharing.

This idea of having a thought 

and immediately needing to share 

it — out of a sense that containing 
it within me will not feed the 
thought its sufficient affirmation, 
that I am unable to affirm my 
own thoughts separate from my 
friends and family — extends not 
just to the things I write, but to the 
private fantasies I have.

I often imagine what could be 

better about any given situation. 
I imagine whose presence I 
would love to have, where else I 
would love to be. I imagine how 
swell it would feel to have some 
skill or trait that I don’t actually 
have. I focus on the absences, 
and so I pull away.

But I often share these fantasies 

with my friends. And I often 
do this without actually letting 
others know that this is a fantasy; 
instead, I’ve lied. And this has led 
to the end of dear friendships, to 
people I love feeling confused, 
manipulated and, ultimately, to me 

feeling profoundly terrible about 
myself. Why couldn’t I just keep 
my mouth shut? Why couldn’t 
I just appreciate the beauty of 
whatever I had in front of me?

I lie to share my fantasy. I 

lie because my fantasy doesn’t 
count if it’s just in me. It needs to 
spread, take root in the minds of 
others, too.

And over the past several 

months, in an effort to gain more 
of a sense of personal privacy, 
I have begun to keep a journal. 
I write in it every couple of 
days. My entries wander, they 
fantasize, they contradict. All of 
this is OK, because it’s in a space 
that only I have access to. My 
journal represents me figuring 
out aspects of myself before 
anybody else has to.

In my journal, there are 

words and ideas that come out 
of me when I am in a meditative 
state, when I’m not consciously 
working to think or to formulate 
thoughts, but instead simply 
commenting on what I am seeing 
as I saunter through my mind. 
Like a toddler standing with a 
clipboard and a piece of paper in a 
fancy museum who is told, “don’t 
worry about the technical jargon, 
just draw what you see.”

And then, since I’ve been 

abroad this semester, I have 
been meditating for 10 minutes 
per day. Pausing for a second, 
momentarily getting out from 
beneath the cutthroat hustle-
and-bustle 
of 
my 
rattled 

conscience. Taking a private 
moment for myself, to focus on 
my breath, my body. To establish 
distance 
between 
me 
and 

everything else. Some distance is 
certainly necessary. 

This 
lesson 
lies 
at 
the 

foundation of what it means 
for me, as an individual, to be 
growing up and becoming more 
independent. 
Understanding 

the 
potential 
beauty 
in 
a 

thought that no one else sees. 
Realizing those thoughts do not 
need affirmation from anybody 
else in order to be full, to have 
real meaning.

F

or 
a 
long 
time, 
I 

thought 
of 
taking 
a 

gap year as a strange 

thing — something only for 
the 
eccentric 
or 

routinely contrarian. 
This 
may 
have 

been a product of 
my 
upbringing: 

Years at a college 
preparatory 
school 

made it difficult to 
imagine any option 
beyond 
immediate 

enrollment into the 
best college I could 
get into. The option 
of taking time off in between 
didn’t even occur to me.

Of my class of 115 students, 

only 
two 
chose 
to 
defer 

attending a system of higher 
education. As some of my 
friends heard of their plans, 
rumors quickly spread that they 
weren’t “good” or “mature” 
enough to go to college. Today, 
I shudder at that ignorance. Far 
from being naive, those two 
made the most mature decision 
an 
18-year-old 
can 
make: 

ignoring the voices of others to 
hone in on their own.

At 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, I’ve always felt a bit 
uncomfortable seeing so many 
of my peers having their lives 
figured out already. It seems 
as if every other student is pre-
something — pre-med, pre-law, 
pre-engineering, 
pre-finance. 

I often feel as if I’m the only 
one who’s still in the process 
of discovering what path bests 
suits me. At the same time, 
however, I’m also a bit skeptical 
of those who decide on a track 
from a young age. Surely, a good 
number of students must pick 
predefined paths as the result 
of certain pressures rather than 
genuine interest.

The opportunity to take a 

high school gap year may have 
passed, but there remains an 
equally intriguing alternative. 
A post-college gap year should 

appeal to both people like me as 
well as those who think they’ve 
already 
figured 
out 
their 

career paths. The options are 

virtually 
limitless 

— solo backpacking, 
teaching 
English, 

working odd jobs, 
volunteering — it’s 
just up to you to 
figure 
out 
what 

clicks best.

Wherever 

students 
choose 

to go on their gap 
year, they’ll likely 
be 
away 
from 

the 
societal 
and 
parental 

pressures that may have over-
exerted 
their 
influence 
on 

their path. Even for students 
set on their plans, a gap year 
could provide time to unwind 
and 
declutter 
their 
minds 

from the relentless regiment 
of 
exams 
and 
homework, 

especially if graduate school 
is in the picture. As former 
Yale 
University 
professor 

William Deresiewicz put it in 
his book “Excellent Sheep: The 
Miseducation of the American 
Elite,” “I can’t tell you the 
number of students who did 
that and (became) strikingly 
different people — fuller, more 
independent, more present in 
their lives, and ready to cut 
through not only the academic 
but also the social bullshit.”

Skeptics of the gap year often 

berate it as an opportunity 
cost to develop a career or get 
a leg up on graduate studies to 
prepare you for professional 
work. I see it another way — 
think of the doctors or lawyers 
who drain years of training, 
hundreds of thousands in loans 
and time away from friends 
just to realize that a career in 
medicine or law isn’t right for 
them. Wouldn’t they rather 
pay the “opportunity cost” of 
a few months off then wake up 
years later and wonder what 
they’ve wasted all their time 

and money on? They likely 
won’t have the privilege of 
a break during their career 
— unpaid sabbatical leave is 
offered by only 12 percent of 
employers, according to the 
Society for Human Resource 
Management, 
and 
only 
4 

percent of employers offered 
paid leave programs last year.

Our early twenties shouldn’t 

be spent laying the foundation 
for a cozy mid-life career. As 
author and entrepreneur Gary 
Vaynerchuk put it, “This is not 
the time to play it practical and 
safe. It is not the time to get 
the job mom and dad wanted 
or 
the 
time 
to 
maximize 

your salary so that you can 
buy a fat whip.” In other 
words, don’t stress over being 
“successful” the second you 
graduate. Sure, parents might 
get uncomfortable at cocktail 
parties when the couple next 
to them brags about their 
daughter’s starting salary at 
some Fortune 500 company, 
while they’re explaining why 
their child is off eating on 
the floor with villagers in 
Peru. Those lucky enough to 
have parents who had such 
experiences when they were 
younger need not worry, but 
students should never let their 
fear of disappointing them (or 
anyone else) stop them from 
exploring the unconventional.

I do not mean to romanticize 

the gap year — rarely is it a 
magical elixir that spits you 
out with purpose and passion. 
Traveling alone and working 
odd jobs can lead to bouts of 
loneliness and a longing for 
the safety of a routine. Yet, it is 
often by enduring these trials 
that they become valuable 
experiences for those who 
have done them.

FROM THE DAILY

Prioritize women’s health

W

ith the endorsement of President Donald Trump, the House 
of Representatives recently passed a bill that criminalizes 
abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill introduces 

fines and prison sentences of up to five years for those who perform the 
procedures, allowing exceptions only in cases of rape or incest, or when 
the health of the pregnant woman is threatened. The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board believes our representatives should not play politics 
with women’s health. The bill’s introduction itself demonstrates that our 
representatives are placing political goals over the importance of women’s 
health and using unsubstantiated scientific claims to drive those goals.

‘I Tell a Fly’ is innovatively 
avant-garde, intersectional

Benjamin 
Clementine 
is 

nowhere close to done innovating. 
On I Tell a Fly, we see the Mercury 
Prize winner experiment more 
than on his 2015 
debut, connecting 
disparate 
influences 
from 

Baroque era music 
all the way up to 
modern pop art. 
That being said, 
it’s hard to classify 
what I Tell a Fly 
really is. Bridging 
so many styles and influences, 
the atmosphere shifts from the 
operatic to the African tribal 
down to meditative soliloquy.

While Clementine is at heart a 

piano singer-songwriter, on his 
most recent album, harpsichord 
emerges dominant. But it comes 
with some cognitive dissonance, 
though, because the last time most 
people have heard its metallic 
twang was high school music 
class. And that’s only the start, 
because Clementine spends the 
whole 45 minute album blending 
this 
extreme 
with 
modern 

sounds and spacy progressions. 
On “Better Sorry than Safe,” the 
sound of a dying Ms. Pac-Man 
is mixed between the Baroque 
instrument.

What remains unchanged is his 

uncanny ability to both explode 
out of nowhere and seamlessly 
distill high-intensity moments 
into subdued piano interludes. 
Take “Phantom of Aleppoville,” 
the 
album’s 
fourth 
track. 

Clementine desperately yearns, 
“Oh leave me / Oh leave me / Leave 
me” between possessive, tribal 
hisses, right before fracturing the 

track into piano, hummed vocals 
and white space.

And 
these 
transitions 
are 

not occurring over the stretch 
of the album, but rather over 
single tracks. In effect, the 
album feels closer to a delicately 
arranged series of movements 
than anything else. Here, we see 
Clementine better reflect classical 
song 
structure 
than 
modern 

composition. Even 
still, accessibility is 
not lost.

As a whole, the 

album 
stretches 

upward. He opens 
“Paris Cor Blimey” 
with the ominous 
“Pandemonium, 
whoa 
/ 

Pandemonium 
/ 

Whoa.” The music is momentous, 
almost 
apocalyptic. 
The 

harpsichord spells doom.

Between the stretches of pure 

instrumentals, Clementine shifts 
sporadically between vocal styles. 
Varying pitch, tone and warmth, 
among other things, Benjamin 
Clementine’s delivery is as unique 
as ever. Just when one expects a 
forceful staccato, he rounds out 
his vowels and stretches them into 
the next line.

At 
points, 
his 
lyrics 
are 

almost incomprehensible, half-
murmured, half crooned. Similar 
to Young Thug’s innovation, he 
takes advantage of these moments 
and finds those internal melodies 
that 
traditional 
song 
would 

obfuscate. In these moments, his 
voice is closer to an instrument 
than it is a medium for language. 
Yet, what is so intriguing in these 
moments is how pushes into 
exciting, unexplored spaces while 
still rooting himself in classical 
traditions.

I Tell a Fly is also intriguing 

from 
a 
technical 
standpoint. 

The soundstage is continually 
manipulated, 
vocals 
and 

instruments alternating between 
center stage and fading into the 
back. Through it all, Clementine’s 
vocals harmonize with either 
his own or with backing singers. 
Generating that same quasi-gospel 
effect that D’Angelo pioneered, the 
album feels massive. Especially in 
those moments where Clementine 
absolutely belts it, I Tell a Fly is 
remarkable. 

“Phantom 
of 
Aleppoville” 

is the most hip-hop influenced 
section of the album, the Spanish 
influenced strings could be easily 
mistaken for a Miseducation of 
Lauryn Hill B-Side. Meanwhile, 
“One Awkward Fish” is the most 
Drum & Bass / Garage influenced 
track on the album. The dampened 
kick / snare feels straight out the 
club. The groovy bassline makes 
contact with early Jungle. Yet, like 
the rest of this album, the track’s 
foundation is stripped down and 
meshed into something larger: in 
this case, echoing, choir music.

Now, when we speak of a 

musician 
having 
“range” 
we 

usually associate to singers who 
can traverse six octaves or multi-
instrumentalist’s with equipment 
taped to every inch of their bodies. 
Yet, what Clementine shows us in 
his “range” is his manipulation 
of auditory space. Just as easily 
as I Tell a Fly explodes and 
oversaturates into the gargantuan, 
it crystallizes into the minimal.

Which is ultimately I Tell a 

Fly’s strength. Here, Benjamin 
Clementine 
simultaneously 

extends across so many discourses 
that it’s hard to trace his influences 
and 
aspirations. 
Avant-garde 

has long been about borrowing 
from the past and reinterpreting 
it to as a response to the present. 
Between the swaths of chamber 
pop to Baroque sonatas to U.K. 
dance, Clementine continues his 
emergence as one of the defining 
singer-songwriters in the U.K. 
right now.

It’s seems like a modern social 

standard to make jokes and jabs 
at vegetarians and vegans. As a 
vegetarian of almost two years, 
and now a vegan of two months, 
I’ve heard enough commentary 
from outsiders to write a whole 
book about it. But to be honest, 
many of them are funny or 
interesting or insightful, so I 
just roll with the punches.

Society 
is 
constantly 

mocking this diet for a plethora 
of reasons — one is the stigma 
that all vegans are bougie-ass, 
arrogant, “Save the animals!” 
activists that will spend a 
whopping six bucks on some 
organic celery stick. Another is 
that the U.S. has a heavy meat 
and dairy industry, and if you’re 
not eating some sort of animal 
product daily, you’re doing 
something wrong.

Some beg the idea that 

vegan diets don’t provide the 
same nutrients that animal-
based products do (which is 
both true and false, though 
mostly 
circumstantial). 
And 

as an athlete, I’ve loved the 

“Well, how do you get protein?” 
question. Oh of course! How 
could I forget? Because the only 
protein source comes from a 
cow or a chicken!

My point here isn’t to give 

comebacks for all the jabs and 
questions. I could throw facts 
or statistics out there, but that 
is why we have the internet and 
food documentaries. Instead, I 
want to reflect on my journey 
of becoming a vegan and how 
my body and mind has so far 
reacted to this lifestyle.

It was January 2016. I was a 

pretty toxic freshman by eating 
crappy foods, picking at my 
acne and partying on weekends. 
I felt nasty, both internally 
and externally, and I knew I 
needed a change. Luckily my 
best friend, Emma, had been 
a vegetarian for a few months 
at the time, and of course, she 
convinced me to do it too.

But it wasn’t as easy as 

“Emma’s a vegetarian, so now 
I will be one too!” I come from 
the Philly area, which is known 
to be meat-heavy area: hoagies, 
cheesesteaks, 
pork 
roll, 

scrapple, etc. I’m also deeply 
involved with my heritage, and 
Ukrainian and Hungarian foods 
are loaded with meat and dairy 
products. Vegetarianism, and of 
course veganism, was not easy 
for me to do.

Nonetheless, after those first 

two weeks of not eating meat, I 

shockingly didn’t miss it at all. 
The taste and the texture of it 
all, it already felt so foreign to 
me. Cheese was still my best 
friend though, and even now 
as a vegan, it is something I do 
miss once in awhile (especially 
when my housemates make a 
bunch of grilled cheese or order 
Domino’s pizza).

Flash 
forward 
to 
June 

of this year. I hadn’t eaten 
meat for eighteen months, I 
had lost weight, both from 
vegetarianism and a lack of 
weight training, and overall, I 
was feeling pretty great. I was 
exercising regularly and filling 
up on as much tofu as possible. 
But there was still something 
about myself that I still wasn’t 
super content with: my skin, my 
constant tiredness, my lack of 
drive.

I visited Emma this summer, 

and she made us a delicious 
vegan 
dinner 
of 
baked 

cauliflower, salad and vegan 
chicken. I was so surprised 
at how easy that meal was to 
cook, and even better, how the 
meal turned out to be delicious. 
It was at this moment when I 
realized if I could eat delicious 
meals like this one, then there 
is no doubt in my mind that I 
could be a vegan.

So I started cutting down 

on cheese, milk and eggs. I ate 
one vegan meal a day, which 

usually consisted of a big bowl 
of black beans, edamame, tofu, 
chickpeas, peas and quinoa. 
Those once-a-day meals turned 
into two and then three. I 
began buying vegan cheese and 
meat to use in my cooking, and 
although it tastes different, it’s 
a taste I am acquiring quickly. 
Regardless of the flavors and 
the specificity of the diet, my 
body and my brain have never 
been better.

Now I feel fuller on just 

two meals, and I eat more 
vegetables 
and 
fruits 
than 

I ever have before. My skin 
cleared up drastically within 
the first month, and I cut down 
on caffeine because I realized 
I didn’t need it — without 
lethargy, I now wake up ready 
to take on the day.

In a way, I simply feel lighter 

— in fact, I feel happier. Maybe 
that’s due to outside factors like 
friends and good classes, but 
regardless, I don’t feel weighed 
down like I used to when I ate 
dairy or meat. I look forward to 
every meal I make, seeing what 

I can add to my diet to make 
it balanced. I’ve opened up to 
new foods that I wouldn’t eat 
in the past (hello, tomatoes and 
kale). And overall, this whole 
experience has given me a sense 
of sureness.

Having a vegan diet has truly 

changed me for the better. 
Beyond the great impact it 
has made to me physically 
and mentally, it’s made me 
a 
more 
committed 
person. 

There is power in committing 
to transforming your body, 
in saying no to foods that are 
wrong for your body and for the 
environment, and in allotting 
time to cook new meals. I 
love seeing what my body and 
brain are capable of doing, and 
veganism has shown me how 
healthy and clean I can be.

It’s time to

 talk veganism

‘Martha P. Johnson’ takes 
on one too many stories

FILM REVIEW

The 
Saint 
of 
Christopher 

Street left this world with as 
much of a bang as she entered it. 
LGBT rights advocate Marsha 
P. Johnson died in 1992, yet 
her death — which was ruled 
a suicide — is still 
open and contested. 
David 
France’s 

(“How to Survive 
the 
Plague”) 

documentary 
gathers stories and 
archive footage of 
Marsha 
and 
her 

friends 
to 
shed 

some light on the 
Stonewall veteran’s 
mysterious 
death. 

“The 
Death 
and 

Life 
of 
Marsha 

P. Johnson” tells the untold 
stories of Johnson, Rivera and 
Nettles. While the film serves 
up a stunning portrait of several 
pioneers for gay and transgender 
rights, it gets confused whether 
it is a cold case crime doc 

or a study of a marginalized 
community who fought for their 
rights.

The 
majority 
of 
the 

documentary follows Victoria 
Cruz, an LGBT rights activist, 
transgender woman and friend 
of Johnson. Cruz tracks down 
many of the cops on Johnson’s 
case to get some answers, of 
which she receives few. For 

the most part, 
Johnson’s 
case 

is 
left 
cold. 

One 
redeeming 

quality 
of 

Cruz’s 
search 

for 
the 
truth 

is 
the 
archive 

footage 
of 

legendary trans-
rights 
activist 

Sylvia 
Rivera, 

Johnson’s friend 
and 
fellow 

Stonewall 

veteran. 
Rivera 
went 
from 

homeless to founding member 
of the Gay Liberation Front, 
an 
outspoken 
activist 
for 

transgender 
rights. 
Without 

Rivera, the documentary would 
be another true crime doc left 

cold, but she deserves more than 
a supporting role — she deserves 
a film of her own.

In addition to Johnson’s case, 

Rivera’s life and Cruz’s quest for 
justice, another story is added 
to the mix, the recent murder 

trial of transgender woman Islan 
Nettles. While the film’s title is 
credited to Marsha P. Johnson, it 
is scattered and busy with telling 

too many stories. Much like 
Rivera, Nettles and even Johnson 
deserve more of a film than they 
got. Yet, the documentary does 
its job in telling the stories that 
need to be told, an admirable and 
difficult task.

Mainstreaming the history 

of the marginalized is no small 
feat, and hopefully through 
France’s documentary activists 
and pioneers alike will get the 
respect and credit they deserve. 
Documentaries have been telling 
stories of the downtrodden for 
ages, the question is whether 
Hollywood can step up to the 
plate. In a post “Moonlight” 
world, 
can 
Hollywood 
tell 

the 
histories 
of 
the 
LGBT 

community 
along 
with 
the 

fictionalized? Past attempts have 
proven to be either tone deaf 
(2015’s “Stonewall”) or masterful 
(2008’s “Milk”).

Perhaps 
France’s 

documentary is better viewed as 
activism than anything else, and 
in that capacity it succeeds with 
flying colors. Filmmakers should 
take note of the difference 
between film as entertainment 
and film as activism; while 
the former leaves audiences 
satisfied, the latter doesn’t. “The 
Death and Life of Marsha P. 
Johnson” is activism incarnate, 
liberating the stories of pioneers 
in the LGBT rights movement 
for the world to be inspired by.

COMMUNITY CULTURE
UMMA exhibition shows 
diverse alumni collection

FILE PHOTO/DAILY

With 
intriguing 
works 

by titans of the modern art 
world — from Jasper Johns 
to Pablo Picasso — on display, 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 

Museum of Art 
has 
continued 

its 
yearlong 

focus on works 
from 
alumni 

collectors. 
“Victors 
for 

Art,” 
which 

serves 
as 
the 

museum’s 
remarkable 
contribution to 
the University’s Bicentennial, 
has 
brought 
together 
an 

extraordinary 
array 
of 

abstract art, all of it borrowed 

or donated by prolific alumni 
art collectors.

At first glance, it seems 

like a strange idea: borrowing 
dozens 
of 
vaguely 
similar 

works of art from collectors, 

then trying to form a cohesive 
whole from the hodgepodge of 
artistic styles and traditions. 
The curators had their work 
cut out for them, basically 
working backwards — rather 
than 
coming 
up 
with 
an 

exhibition theme and then 
selecting art to fit the theme, 

they had to take 
the alumni pieces 
and 
somehow 

make 
sense 
of 

them as a body of 
work.

Yet, 
to 
the 

curators’ 
credit, 

the 
exhibition 

is 
surprisingly 

cohesive, with a 
clear arrangement 
of 
artwork 

that 
provokes 

reflection 
and 
comparison. 

This was no small feat, as 
the 
abstract 
pieces 
range 

from big name contemporary 
to 
midcentury 
monocolors, 

casual sketches to disturbing 
collages.

Even abstraction itself is 

only broadly referenced in 
the 
display, 
which 
places 

modern pieces side by side 
with 
works 
not 
usually 

considered abstract, let alone 
art: Ancient Chinese scrolls 
and an Amish quilt make 
appearances 
as 
“abstract” 

art. While some might take 
offense to this extremely loose 
interpretation, it’s a bold move 
that expands our definition of 
“real” art and questions the 
legitimacy of clear-cut artistic 
definitions.

This 
boundary-pushing 

attitude 
undoubtedly 

reflects the diverse group 
of curators involved in the 
exhibition: 
Joseph 
Rosa, 

the former UMMA director, 
guest-curated the exhibition 
alongside 
specialists 
in 

African 
art, 
photography, 

Asian art and Western art. 
Employing 
such 
a 
varied 

group 
of 
curators 
was 
a 

smart move, ensuring that 
global 
artistic 
traditions 

were respected and placed 
on 
equal 
footing. 
Luckily, 

the curatorial team had an 
exceptionally 
cosmopolitan 

collection to work with — the 
University alumni lent a far-
ranging assortment of art, 
from 
European 
Modernist 

sculpture 
to 
Colombian 

canvases.

Rather than throwing a few 

“token diversity” artists in for 
good measure, the exhibition 
makes 
diverse 
artwork 
a 

main focus and often seems 
to challenge the status quo by 
placing works by established 
white male artists in direct 
conversation 
with 
lesser 

known pieces.

On one thin white wall, 

a 
Picasso 
sketch 
called 

“Weeping Woman” sits next 
to Grace Hartigan’s painting 
“Untitled (The Second Mrs. 
Nash).” The pieces, one by a 

man famous for painting his 
mistresses nude, the other by 
a woman whose work often 
focused 
on 
gender 
issues, 

depict a woman’s emotional 

inner 
world 
in 
starkly 

contrasting ways. “Weeping 
Woman” is a brash, beautiful 
sketch of a woman in torment, 
her childlike anguish and dark 
sexuality rendered in violent 
strokes. It’s striking, and yet 
placed 
next 
to 
Hartigan’s 

work, a murky watercolor in 
shades of orange, a woman’s 
dreamlike 
figure 
scattered 

around the canvas as if divided 
internally, the Picasso piece 
seems oversimplified.

The Picasso is a lovely 

sketch of an unhappy woman, 
drawn by a man who loved but 
did not really understand the 
women in his life. It seems 
to ask: Why is she crying? 
Hartigan 
tells 
a 
different 

story, at once more complex 
and more heartbreaking — 
it shows us a woman whose 
torment 
is 
internal, 
not 

written on her face and body; a 
woman with an interior world 
as labyrinthine as Hartigan 
herself. Picasso’s woman is 
sad, so she cries, a fantasy 
woman 
enchanting 
in 
her 

simplicity. Hartigan’s “Mrs. 
Nash” is harder to read, her 
cloudy 
emotions 
rendering 

her as unfathomable as, well, 
a real woman. This intriguing 
juxtaposition, 
just 
one 
of 

many in the exhibition, shows 
the profound thoughtfulness 
the UMMA curators put into 

artistic arrangement.

Somehow, 
despite 
the 

overwhelming 
diversity 
of 

artworks and genres, it all 
just works. More than that, 

“Victors for Art” offers a 
refreshing alternative to the 
ubiquity of Old White Dudes in 
abstract art. You’ll see plenty 

of big name artists scattered 
around the exhibition, but 
even then, they’re rarely the 
expected or familiar pieces. 
There’s a Jasper Johns, of 
course, but rather than one 
of his over-used flags, the 
curators selected a wonderful 
sober 
painting 
in 
gray 

tones, a prescient selection 
considering the current art 
world fervor over his later-life 
work.

Beyond 
these 
familiar 

faces, the exhibition really 
shines, 
with 
a 
superb 

selection of abstract work 
by women artists and global 
artists. This should come as 
no surprise considering the 
diversity of curators involved 
in the project, but it’s still 
depressingly 
rare 
to 
find 

such variety and respect for 
women and artists of color, 
with compelling works by 
Louise 
Nevelson, 
Seikichi 

Takara, Betty Woodman, and 
Jordan 
Eagles 
prominently 

displayed. 
Whether 
you’re 

a fan of abstraction or not, 
nearly every art lover will find 
something to admire in this 
sprawling exhibition — it may 
well be one of UMMA’s most 
ambitious efforts in recent 
years. “Victors for Art” will 
remain on display through 
October 29 in the A. Alfred 
Taubman Gallery.

Advantage in shots not enough

Senior forward Dexter Dancs 

lined up the puck and let it fly — 
wide past the goaltender. 

Dancs’s first-period misfire 

would prove to be a recurring 
theme in the Michigan hockey 
team’s first loss of the season 
Saturday night.

The Wolverines (1-1-0) faced 

off 
against 
two 
opponents 

this weekend at St. Lawrence 
University 
and 
Clarkson 

University 
on 
Friday 
and 

Saturday, 
respectively. 
They 

outshot 
their 

opponents, 
56-43, 
but 

had just three 
combined goals 
to show for it.

They 
would 

go on to split 
the 
weekend, 

earning a 3-1 win 
before suffering 
a 3-0 loss.

The start of 

Michigan’s outing against the 
Saints went just as expected 
after its 10-1 exhibition opening 
win against Western Ontario 

the week before. The team let 27 
shots fly and amassed three goals 
as a result.

Senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone was a part of the 
offensive onslaught, tacking on 
the Wolverines’ first goal in the 
opening period off a power play. 
His five shots led the team on a 
night that had seemed to be a 
trend for the season thus far.

In 
its 
matchup 
Saturday, 

though, the Golden Knights 
proved that even if Michigan 
outshoots its opponents, it still 
has vulnerabilities.

“In some regards, we played 

better 
than 

we played last 
night,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Mel 
Pearson 

after Saturday’s 
game. “And some 
nights the puck 
just doesn’t go in 
the net for you.

“I 
thought 

we 
created 

some 
good 

opportunities, you know. We got 
behind the 8-ball early and got 
down a couple goals, but from 
that point on, I thought we were 

the better team.”

Going 
into 
the 
Clarkson 

matchup, the Wolverines knew 
they would face a real challenge, 
according to Pearson.

With the Wolverines’ 29-19 

advantage in shots, onlookers 
would have been left puzzled by 
their inability to net a single goal.

“We stayed with the game 

plan, we kept pushing, we kept 
working,” Pearson said. “We just 
didn’t get any puck luck tonight, 
and some nights, it’s going to go 
that way for you.”

While a non-conference, early-

season loss is certainly not the 
end of the world, the offensive 
juggernaut that Michigan had 
seemed to be was stymied due 
to the simple fact that the puck 
didn’t find the back of the net.

Though 
the 
performance 

of the Wolverines so far looks 
promising, to say the least, they 
will have to figure out how to 
overcome situations when they 
struggle to score, even with 
numerous opportunities.

Without another game until 

October 20, Michigan has almost 
two weeks to fix its special teams 
woes and focus on finding the 
net.

Offense looks for improvement 

“Improvement week” came and 

went for Jim Harbaugh and the 
Michigan football team.

It wouldn’t be surprising if the 

Wolverines feel like they need 
another one. 

But there aren’t any more 

bye weeks on the schedule. The 
Wolverines will have to play 
Indiana this weekend, and progress 
will have to be made regardless.

Michigan, quite simply, has some 

soul-searching to do on offense after 
an abysmal performance Saturday 
in a 14-10 loss to Michigan State.

Fifth-year senior center Patrick 

Kugler summed up the state of 
the team pretty well on Monday 
afternoon — it’s go time for the 
Wolverines.

“There can’t be any more errors 

now,” Kugler said. “We’ve got to 
win out now, plain and simple.”

Kugler was a starting member 

of a unit that had easily its worst 
outing of the season against the 
Spartans. Michigan gained just 300 
total yards of offense, converted 
5-of-17 third downs, averaged 2.6 
yards per rush, completed 5.7 yards 
per passing attempt — and most 
glaringly, turned the ball over five 
times.

“We played a sloppy game,” 

Kugler said. “Everyone can see 
that.”

The issues with the offense read 

like a laundry list. Kugler didn’t 
agree that the sloppiness was a 
recurring issue — but through five 
games, it certainly seems like that 
may be the case.

The Wolverines currently rank 

97th in total offense, 83rd in passing 
offense, 75th in rushing offense, 
105th in offensive efficiency and are 
tied for 110th in turnover margin.

“We’ve just got to play better 

as a whole,” Kugler said. “Little 
things we’ve got to improve on. No 
turnovers, we’ve got to eliminate 
turnovers. That’s our main thing. 
But it’s a collective effort and as a 
group, we’ve got to play better.”

As Kugler alluded to, there were 

many different components of 

the offense that struggled against 
Michigan State.

Fifth-year senior John O’Korn 

started in place for an injured 
Wilton Speight and struggled, 
completing just 16-of-35 passes for 
198 yards with three interceptions. 
According 
to 
Harbaugh, 
he’ll 

remain the starter going forward, 
and Kugler reiterated his trust in 
O’Korn.

“He’s 
our 
quarterback,” 

Kugler said. “You’ve got to have 
100 percent (confidence) in your 
quarterback, and I know he’s going 
to play better next game.”

One position the Wolverines did 

change was right tackle. Midway 
through the game, the coaching 
staff replaced redshirt sophomore 
Nolan Ulizio with redshirt junior 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty. Harbaugh 
wouldn’t confirm whether Bushell-
Beatty has taken over the starting 
job going forward.

Meanwhile, 
Michigan’s 
play 

calling — especially in the second 
half, as it rained heavily — came 
under criticism. Just when it 
seemed 
the 
Wolverines 
had 

finally grasped momentum, three 
consecutive 
possessions 
ended 

with interceptions.

Harbaugh was defensive when 

asked about the staff’s calls, which 
he confirmed he has the final 
say over. And like at right tackle, 
it remains unknown whether 
any major changes will occur 
schematically.

“I want to look at the film, I want 

to learn from it,” Harbaugh said. 
“I’m not gonna get into questioning 
the play-calling.

“It’s a very convenient thing, 

right? Play worked and, ‘Hey, it was 
a great play,’ because it worked. 
Play doesn’t work, ‘Would you wish 
you had done something else, had a 
different play call?’ Sure, that’s very 
easy to do. Hindsight is 20/20.”

A complete overhaul of the 

offense may not be realistic at 
this point in the season. And if 
Harbaugh and Kugler’s comments 
on Monday are taken at face value, 
sweeping changes don’t appear to 
be on the way.

Of course, the platitudes and 

curt responses could be hiding 
something else.

Canned answers aside, one 

thing is for sure. Michigan knows 
it has to improve, and improve fast.

“Everyone’s just got to sack up,” 

Kugler said. “It’s time to go.”

Despite strong performance, ‘M’ 
defense tasked with moving on

This defense has no business 

claiming 
responsibility 
for 

Saturday’s outcome. And yet, it 
is anyway. 

Senior 
linebacker 
Mike 

McCray did so in the immediate 
aftermath 
of 
Michigan’s 

14-10 loss to Michigan State. 
Sophomore cornerback David 
Long followed suit Monday 
afternoon.

“We left some plays out there 

on the field that could have 
changed the game,” he said. 
“I’m right there with Mike. I 
think we definitely could have 
helped.”

But then, of course, there 

is 
this 
fact: 
the 
Spartans 

recorded only one first down 
in the second half of Saturday’s 
contest. It’s hard to ask for 
much more, especially given 
who Michigan’s defense was 
facing.

While Long was quick to 

say Michigan State’s Brian 
Lewerke 
was 
no 
different 

than any other quarterback 
the Wolverines have faced 
this year, that isn’t necessarily 
the case. In Lewerke — who 
leads the Spartans with 342 
rushing 
yards 
and 
three 

rushing 
touchdowns 
while 

still boasting an average of 211 
passing yards per game — the 
Wolverines encountered the 
most 
dangerous 
dual-threat 

quarterback they have faced all 
year.

And Michigan’s secondary 

rose to that challenge, finally 
legitimizing its rank as the 
second-best passing defense in 
the nation despite a lineup that 
featured new faces across the 
board entering the year. The 
Wolverines are allowing just 
126 yards per game through the 
air, trailing only Air Force, and 
they held Lewerke below that 
average.

The 
Spartan 
quarterback 

mustered 
just 
94 
passing 

yards and averaged just 4.3 

yards per attempt. Six of his 
11 completions came on the 
Spartans’ touchdown drive in 
the second quarter, and his 
sole passing touchdown was 
a screen pass to running back 
Madre London.

The 
secondary 
notched 

four 
pass 
breakups, 
one 

from sophomore safety Josh 
Metellus and another three 
from sophomore cornerback 
Lavert Hill. Metellus credited 
Hill’s 
dedication 
to 
his 

technique as the main source 
of 
his 
consistent 
success 

this season, calling it “just 
something you’re born with.”

“Lavert, he takes pride in his 

technique,” Metellus said. “He 
doesn’t like being on the short 
end of the stick. Lavert, he just 
plays his heart out every play, 
makes sure that nobody can 
catch a ball on him. And if they 
do, he comes back the next play 
trying even harder.”

On Saturday night, that is 

exactly what the unit as a whole 
did. Michigan State scored two 
touchdowns in the first half. It 
mustered just 66 yards in the 
second.

And yet, the Wolverines lost 

anyway.

Through four games, the 

17th-ranked 
Wolverines 
got 

away with making mistakes. In 
reality, they were just delaying 
the 
inevitable. 
Against 

Michigan State, though, there 
was no more delaying it — their 
five 
turnovers 
had 
drastic 

consequences.

For 
Metellus, 
those 

consequences materialized in 
the immediate aftermath of 
Saturday night.

He 
admitted 
he 
was 

emotional. He confessed it 
“just really hurt to see all my 
brothers 
with 
their 
heads 

held down.” And more than 
anything, the image of the 
Michigan fans that remained 
in the stadium was implanted 
in his mind.

“Everybody in the crowd, 

they looked at us like they was 

kind of disappointed,” he said. 
“So you know, that just hurt. I 
just don’t like having somebody 
else having a better hand (than) 
me, having a one up on me.”

But 
the 
Spartans 
did, 

and 
Saturday’s 
outcome 

left 
Metellus 
admitting 

Monday afternoon that these 
Wolverines 
hadn’t 
faced 

adversity 
before. 
He’s 
not 

wrong.

Now, Michigan has a tally in 

the loss column, staring down 
the road at a season that will 
likely require an undefeated 
run for the Wolverines to have 
any hopes of playing for the 
Big Ten Championship. And it 
remains to be seen what impact 
Saturday night’s loss could 
have.

“I think this is gonna bring 

us more together as a team,” 
Metellus said. “… Everything’s 
been going pretty smooth for us 
so, you know, I feel like this is a 
big test. What we had planned 
for the season, I feel like this 
is gonna bring us all together, 
bring us to our full potential.”

That potential remains to 

be seen. On the offensive side, 
Michigan’s identity remains a 
mystery — even more so now 
that fifth-year senior John 
O’Korn is the quarterback. As 
for the opposite side of the ball, 
there’s almost no doubt about 
where this defense stands.

From Chase Winovich to 

Devin Bush Jr., and everywhere 
in between, this defense speaks 
with an uninhibited confidence 
in its ability.

“We as a defense, you know, 

we’re hungry,” Metellus said. 
“We want to be the ones to win 
the game. We want to be the 
ones that everyone can count 
on.

“We like competing, so we 

just take it upon ourselves to 
give everything we got, no 
matter how hard it is, no matter 
how tough it is, no matter what 
the situation is. The defense, 
we just want to handle things 
our way.”
