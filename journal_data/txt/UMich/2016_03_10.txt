Campus voters, 

independents aid in 
upset victory over 
Hillary Clinton

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. Sen Bernie Sanders won a 

heavily unexpected upset victory 
in Michigan’s Democratic primary 
Tuesday — and that victory was 
marked by a historic voter turnout 
for the state, especially among 
young voters.

Multiple polling places ran out 

of ballots as a record 2.5 million 
voters went to the polls or voted 
absentee — soundly beating a 
previous 1972 record of 1.9 million 
votes cast.

In 
previous 
primaries 
and 

caucuses, 
much 
of 
Sanders’ 

support has come largely from 
young, white, middle class voters, 
while Clinton has fared better with 
Black voters. In Michigan, Sanders 
held onto his usual demographic, 
earning 57 percent of the white 

vote and 67 percent of voters under 
45 with numbers closer to 80 
percent for millennials, according 
to CNN exit polls.

Charles Shipan, University of 

Michigan political science and 
public policy professor, said large 
turnout numbers were one of 
the main factors contributing to 
Sanders’ victory in Michigan.

“A huge turnout happened,” 

he said. “And that’s the biggest 
predictor of how Sanders is going 
to do in an election. If he can get a 
high youth turnout ,then he does 
better.”

Locally, Sanders did extremely 

well in Washtenaw County, where 
he won by an 11.7 percent margin. 
Voter turnout in Washtenaw was 
slightly higher than the state 
average: 39.85 percent of the voting 
age population in Washtenaw cast 
ballots, compared to 31.6 percent 
statewide. 
Turnout 
was 
also 

elevated in Clinton County, home 
of Michigan State University, at 
38.31 percent.

Panels talk 
depression as 
it connects to 
relationships

By WILL FEUER

Daily Staff Reporter

The Depression on College 

Campuses conference — a two-
day event hosted by the University 
of Michigan’s Depression Center 

— began Wednesday afternoon in 
Rackham Auditorium.

The 
conference 
aims 
to 

discuss causes and treatments 
of 
depression 
on 
campuses 

throughout the United States, 
with a focus on relationships. It 
has been held at the University for 
the past 14 years, with 150 people 
attending this year, a handful of 
which were undergraduates.

Becca Lindsay, project manager 

in Health Management and Policy, 
said she thought that despite 
the low undergraduate turnout, 

the conference was extremely 
relevant on campus.

“This conference is really great 

for students on campus because 
it gets you thinking more about 
issues that really impact you and 
your peers,” she said.

Wednesday’s portion of the 

conference consisted of a keynote 
speech 
delivered 
by 
Bernice 

Pescosolido, 
director 
of 
the 

Indiana Consortium for Mental 
Health Services Research at the 
University of Indiana. Pescosolido 
discussed 
how 
different 

generations respond to and treat 
depression in different ways.

“A confluence of forces have 

shifted the place of mental health 
at U.S. universities and colleges,” 
she said. “This provides a unique 
opportunity to rethink the way we 
construct learning environments, 
engage in institutional social 
change, 
and 
create 
a 
less 

stigmatizing society regarding 
mental health and illness.”

the 
keynote 

speech, attendees broke up into

National Institutes 
of Health provides 
grant for Fathers 
and Sons Project

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Father and Sons Project, 

a 
Flint-based 
organization 

that works with male African-
American youth living apart 
from their fathers, will expand 
their preventative project to 
the Chicago area through a 
$3 million grant awarded to 
the University of Michigan’s 
School of Public Health.

The program, which works 

to 
conduct 
preventative 

research on early substance 
abuse, early sexual initiation 
and 
youth 
violence 
among 

African Americans, was funded 
through the National Institute 
of Child Health and Human 
Development, 
part 
of 
the 

National Institutes of Health.

According to a study by 

the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored 
People, 
African 
Americans 

represent 
26 
percent 
of 

all juvenile arrests and 12 
percent of the total drug-using 
population in the United States. 
The NAACP also found that 35 
percent of African-American 
children in seventh to 12th 
grades have been suspended or 
expelled at some point in their 
education.

For 
Cleopatra 
Caldwell, 

principal investigator in the 
Fathers and Sons Project and 
director of the Center for 
Research on Ethnicity, Culture 
and Health at the University’s 
School of Public Health, the 
NAACP’s 
recent 
statistics 

demonstrate 
the 
need 
for 

programs like the University’s.

Caldwell said looking at the 

effects of nonresidential fathers, 
or fathers that live separately 
from their biological children, 
has often been disregarded 
in 
research. 
However,

Some, but not all 
institutions to see 
return to pre-2011 

appropriations

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

This 
year’s 
budget 

recommendations 
from 

Gov. Rick Snyder (R) for 
the 
2017-2018 
fiscal 
year 

included 
recommendations 

for increases in a number 

of areas, including higher 
education spending.

 The increase is larger than 

what’s been seen in the last 
several years, after an initial 
slash to funding of 15 percent 
when Snyder entered office 
in 2011. Following the cut, 
funding has been increased 
steadily — this year’s increase 
of 4.3 percent brings the 
total state funding back to 
pre-2011 levels. However, at 
individual institutions, the 
proposed 2017 numbers could 
still be lower than pre-2011 — 
including at the University.

 In 2011, the across the 

board cut resulted in a 21.6 
percent decrease of funding 
for the University. Because 
of how money is distributed, 
the University still receives 
7.8 percent less funding that 
it did prior to 2011, though 
institutions like Grand Valley 
State University and Ferris 
State University have seen 
increases in funding over their 
2011 levels of 5.25 percent and 
3.6 percent, respectively.

 For many, the cut resulted 

in changes to operations —

New tool could 
aid children with 
aggresive brain 

tumors

By SOPHIE SHERRY

Daily Staff Reporter

Researchers at the University 

of Michigan have developed a new 
tool to test potential treatments 
for pediatric brain cancer.

A team led by Maria Castro and 

Pedro 
Lowenstein, 
professors 

of neurosurgery and cell and 
developmental 
biology, 
has 

created a mouse model which 
harbors all the genetic alterations 
found in pediatric brain tumors. 
Using 
the 
new 
model, 
the 

researchers 
have 
replicated 

pediatric brain tumors in mice 
that will allow the mice to serve as 
test beds for new pharmaceuticals 
and immunotherapies designed to 
shrink children’s brain tumors — 
specifically high-grade glioma, 
which is an aggressive and 
malignant type of brain tumor.

Exercise studio 
seeks to attract 
millennials with 

new venue

By EMILY DAVIES

Daily Staff Reporter

Exercise studio Pure Barre is 

adding to its hundreds of stores 
nationwide with the addition 
of a downtown studio in Ann 
Arbor, opening on East Liberty 
Street, in an aim to increase 
the demographics it attracts. 
The store is the second in Ann 
Arbor, with another on Oak 
Valley Drive.

Two years ago, Pure Barre 

moved to its Oak Valley Drive 
location after a studio on Felch 
Street, closer to the University 
of Michigan, failed to meet the 
company’s needs. Anna Locke, 
an owner of the Oak Street 
studio and of the new studio on 

East Liberty, said the location 
didn’t provide the right amount 
of space.

“Our current studio started 

downtown 
on 
Felch 
Street 

and then we moved locations 
a few years ago just because 
of parking and our studio at 
the time could not fit nearly 
as many people as our current 
studio can,” Locke said. “We 
just outgrew that location.”

With their earlier move, 

however, came a loss of younger 
customers. 

“After we moved to this 

current location, we lost a 
certain demographic,” Locke 
said. “We lost a lot of college 
students and young working 
professionals from downtown, 
so 
our 
goal 
going 
back 

downtown and moving into 
Liberty is that we are going to 
target that demographic and 
bring Pure Barre back to those 
people.”

Pure Barre is a barre studio 

that uses the ballet barre, 
body weights and small space 
movements 
to 
build 
lean 

muscle mass. The workouts are 
popular among some University 
students, such as LSA freshman 
Lexi Dubreuil.

“I like that it’s lower impact 

stuff,” Dubreuil said. “I have 
a lot of shin problems from 
running track in high school, 
and it gives me a way to stay 
toned and in shape without 
doing a lot of high-impact 
stuff.”

LSA freshman Sarah Guss, 

who said she plans to join Pure 
Barre’s studio on East Liberty, 
echoed Dubreuil’s sentiments.

“I love how challenging it 

is and how you are told the 
parts of your body that you are 
working out in the class. I also 
feel like you’re getting a great 
workout and it burns but you 
don’t break much of a sweat.”

The studio is expected to 

open in June.

PROTEST ON M AIN

The University of Michigan’s 
own 
Daniel 
Passino’s 

audition for NBC’s The Voice 
has 
generated 
organized 

student support of their 
classmate.

Passino is a senior study-

ing opera in the school of 
Music, Theatre and Dance.

In his audition, Passino 

sang the Charlie Puth and 
Meghan Trainor song “Mar-
vin Gaye.” Blake Shelton 
and Christina Aguilera both 
turned around in their seats 
indicating that they wanted 
to mentor Passino, and he 
ultimately opted to join Team 
Christina for the upcoming 
season of the Voice.

“You have been one of my 

biggest idols and inspira-
tions,” Passino told Aguilera 
as he accepted a spot on her 
team.

Passino tweeted last night, 

thanking all those who sup-
port him on his musical jour-
ney

In addition to those who 

viewed it live on television, 
a video of the audition post-
ed on The Voice’s Youtube 
channel had gathered over 
147,680 views in only 24 
hours, and this number con-
tinues to grow.

Passino’s friends and peers 

at the University are excited 
to support their classmate. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Michael 

Funkhouser is a friend of 
Passino and said he has no 
doubt of his impending suc-
cess.

“The first time I met Dan-

iel he was singing and right 
away I noticed how passion-
ate he was about what he 
does,” Funkhouser said. “He 
doesn’t just sing, he doesn’t 
just listen to music. He’s con-
stantly working on getting 
better, he’s honestly one of 
the hardest working people I 
know. Whether he wins The 
Voice competition or not he’s 
going to achieve his dream 
one way or another, I know 
it.”

Unlike 
adult 
with 
brain 

tumors, 
children 
cannot 

receive 
radiation 
therapy 

because children’s brains have 
a highly impermeable blood-
brain barrier, meaning most 
chemotherapeutic agents are 
not responsive.

Carl Koschmann, a cancer 

specialist at the UM Mott’s 
Children’s Hospital and the first 
author of the study, explained 
children with high-grade glioma 
are even more challenging to 
treat.

“Pediatric 
high-grade 

glioma remains very difficult 
to treat effectively, and most 
children will not survive beyond 
two years of receiving this 
diagnosis,” Koschmann said. 
“The difference is that some 
of the tools that work for other 
cancers, including surgery and 
radiation, are difficult to use on 
a child’s brain. Chemotherapy 
works for some brain tumors, but 
high-grade glioma is resistant to 
almost all chemotherapy.”

The 
inability 
to 
use 

chemotherapy has led to the 
exploration of several alternative 
methods of treatment, including 
DNA damaging drugs. 

DNA-damaging drugs have 

existed for many years and are 
used for various purposes in 
adult patients, but University 
researchers have found that, 
when used on the new model 
mice, they shrank the size of 
their brain tumors.

One-third of children with 

brain tumors have a mutation in 
the ATRX protein that already 
helps repair damage to the cells 
— Castro said by furthering that 
damage to the cells with the 
drugs, they were able to kill it all 
together.

“If you have bad mutations, 

your DNA is unstable, so you 
treat it with a drug that induces 
further damage, and the cell 
dies more readily, that means 
you are going to be able to treat 
these children in a better way,” 
he said.

Third-year medical student 

Flor Mendez worked on the 
research project, and said she 
thought the progress they have 
made will help future treatment.

“Our work on the role of 

ATRX mutations, prevalent in 
pediatric GBM, uncovered that 
ATRX deficient tumors have 
a defect in a mechanism of 
DNA repair which makes them 
more sensitive to therapies that 
induce DNA damage to destroy 
tumor cells,” she said. “This 
knowledge 
will 
help 
guide 

the development of improved 
therapies 
for 
patients 
with 

ATRX mutations.”

Other University researchers 

within the same lab have also 
been working to develop new 
treatment techniques through 
immunotherapy, 
which 
the 

mouse model can also be used 
for. That form of treatment 
trains the immune system to 
recognize and attack cancer 
cells, which Castro said is 
incredibly difficult due to the 
complex nature of cancer cells.

“Tumors have mechanisms 

by which they can hijack the 
immune 
system, 
they 
trick 

the immune system and they 
become kind of invisible so what 
you need to do is unmask it,” 
Castro said. “And you need to be 
able to allow the immune system 
to be able to see the tumor as an 
invader in a way as they would 

see a bacteria or a virus.”

The new mouse model 

allows for developments in 
immunotherapy 
because 

the model has a fully 
functioning 
immune 

system Castro said. Most 
models 
currently 
used 

for research take tumors 
from human patients to 
prepare cells for testing, 
but these cells are not 
compatible with animal 
models. 
Therefore, 

researchers 
cannot 
test 

immunotherapeutic 
strategies. 

Lowenstein said he finds 

immunotherapy appealing 
as a scientific avenue for 
treatments for a variety of 
reasons.

“The ability to harness 

the power of the immune 
system to treat cancer is a 
very attractive treatment 
modality 
for 
these 

devastating 
childhood 

brain cancers, as it could 
provide an effective, safe 
and non-invasive treatment 
strategy,” Lowenstein said.

though it followed a downward 
trend 
of 
funding, 
it 
was 

much more significant than 
previous years. Michigan State 
University, which saw a 23.7 
percent decrease as a result of 
the cut and is still 7.9 percent 
below 2010 levels, has shifted 
funding resources, aiming to 
raise more of its operating 
budget through sources like 
increased tuition and donations. 
At the University, the 2011 cuts 
resulted in a series of changes, 
including the closing of the 
Center for Ethics in Public Life 
and offering several smaller 
classes, along with a 6.7 percent 
tuition increase. It was also 
accompanied by a similar push 
in fundraising. In November 
2013, the University launched 
the 
Victors 
for 
Michigan 

campaign 
— 
the 
largest 

fundraising campaign for any 
university at the time — with 
an overall goal of $4 billion, $1 
billion of which is specifically 
set aside for student financial 
support.

In an interview on Feb. 

15, Cynthia Wilbanks, vice 
president 
of 
government 

relations for the University, 
noted that despite remaining 
below 2011 funding, the amount 
the University receives is still 
high by comparison, as it’s 
allocated 21 percent of the total 
higher education funding in 
Snyder’s budget proposal.

“It’s important to keep in 

mind that of the $61 million 
that has been recommended 
by the governor, the University 
of 
Michigan 
will 
receive 

21 percent,” she said. “The 
percentages mask the resources 
that actually are being provided 

to the University, so from my 
perspective 21 percent of $61 
million is a good outcome.”

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) said he does not believe 
the state’s largest institution 
should still have funding below 
2010 levels, but added that he is 
glad to see overall progress in 
increasing funding.

“Our flagship institution is 

going to be below where they 
were when the governor took 
over,” he said. “I’m happy about 
the increase — it is moving in 
the right direction. I was happy 
when I found out it was going to 
be back from the cuts in 2011, 
but I found out that wasn’t true. 
There are certain institutions 
that are not being treated as 
well as the others.”

Speaking to previous year’s 

increases, 
Zemke 
said 
he 

thought they were too low to 
compensate for inflation, also 
noting that higher education 
funding 
rates 
could 
have 

bigger impacts on the economy 
because 
of 
student 
debt 

burdens.

“The 
increase 
last 
year 

was very small, I don’t even 
think it amounted to the rate 
of inflation,” he said. “I don’t 
think we are putting enough 
money in higher ed. Student 
debt is stymieing our economy 
— 
everybody 
acknowledges 

this.”

Along with the changing 

levels of funding, over the past 
several years, state increases 
in funding have also come 
with new performance-based 
stipulations, based on a number 
of categories such as graduation 
rate as well as a requirement 
that institutions cap tuition 
increases for the year at a 
certain 
percentage 
point. 

This year’s funding increase 

was paired with a 4.8 percent 
tuition increase cap for every 
institution.

In the past, the University 

has not supported any sort of 
tuition caps correlating with 
funding increases, saying they 
believed decisions about how 
to fund the University should 

be made internally. However, 
it has kept within them, unlike 
several 
other 
institutions.

The University’s most recent 
increase last year of 2.7 percent 
was under the 3.2 percent state 
increase cap and correlated 
with a 5.9 percent funding 
increase for the University.

Wilbanks said it was too 

soon to project how this year’s 
funding increase would interact 
with the University’s financial 
model, such as tuition.

The 
budget 
won’t 
be 

finalized until it’s voted on by 
the state House and Senate, a 
process that typically doesn’t 

occur until the summer and 
during which numbers can 
often change.

“I would say that it is too early 

to make any kind of projection 
as to what the University is 
going to do in regard to a tuition 
increase,” Wilbanks said.

turnout strongly aided Sanders’ 
victory in Michigan.

“I would definitely say that 

students helped Sanders’ cause in 
Michigan,” he said. “In most states 
we’ve seen Sanders perform well 
in, students have been taking to the 
polls to make their opinion heard.”

Shipan said youth turnout is 

historically lower because many 
young people are not registered 
to vote. However, when they 
are registered in equal numbers 
to other age groups, turnout is 
approximately the same, he said.

Since the beginning of the year, 

several 
student 
organizations 

have launched large efforts to 
encourage registration, including 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 

College Democrats and Central 
Student Government, with voter 
registration booths across campus. 
On election day, the groups — both 
of which don’t endorse specific 
candidates in the primary — also 
distributed information on polling 
locations and encouraged students 
to go vote.

Shipan said this sort of activity 

would largely benefit Sanders, 
given the portion of the youth vote 
he typically earns.

“There’s no doubt that it helps,” 

he said. “Given that Sanders draws 
a lot of support from young voters, 
any effort in general to increase 
student awareness of how to vote 
and how to register is going to help 
him disproportionately.”

Another component to Sanders’ 

victory was his overwhelming 
support 
among 
independents 

— CNN exit polls showed him 
winning 71 percent of independent 
voters.

Michigan has an open primary 

system, meaning individuals can 
vote in a party’s primary without 
needing to be registered with that 
party.

Shipan said that system likely 

benefitted Sanders, noting that 
many Democrats who would have 
supported Clinton may have felt 
confident that she would win based 
on the polling numbers and instead 
voted in the Republican primary in 
opposition to frontrunner Donald 
Trump.

In polls leading up to Tuesday’s 

vote, Clinton was projected to take 
the state by over 20 points.

“I suspect that the extent that 

there were Democrats who crossed 
over to vote in the Republican 
primary as an anti-Trump vote, 
Clinton lost more people than 
Sanders did,” he said. “The open 
primary aspect benefitted him.”

Sanders also did well among 

Black 
voters 
in 
Michigan 

compared to previous primaries, 
competing roughly at a 2:1 margin 
with Clinton in Michigan and 
decreasing leads in counties she 
was expected to win handily, such 
as Wayne County. The breakdown 
of voters was a significant contrast 
to Clinton’s win in Mississippi the 
same night, where she captured 89 
percent of the Black vote according 
to exit polling.

Shipan said Sanders’ improved 

performance among Black voters 
was one factor in why the polls 
were wrong, with voters who were 
predicted to go for Clinton sticking 
with the senator instead.

“He didn’t do great, but he 

did far better than anywhere in 
the South,” he said. “That has 
previously provided (Clinton) with 
a huge margin of victory in states 
with a large Black population, but 
not to the same extent.”

Kolenda 
said 
he 
thought 

Sanders’ record on trade policies 

like the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, instituted under 
President Bill Clinton, were a major 
player in his success.

Sanders has repeatedly come out 

against various free-trade policies, 
arguing that they negatively impact 
blue-collar workers, a demographic 
prevalent in the state of Michigan.

Clinton 
has 
responded 
to 

Sanders’ claims by citing her 
decision to vote against a trade pact 
while serving as senator, the only 
trade agreement to be put to a vote 
during her term. 

Kolenda said these types of 

workers are largely impacted by 
Sanders’ strong stance on this 
issue, noting that they may have 
helped combat a predicted drop 
in young voter turnout from many 
college campuses being on Spring 
Break Tuesday.

“Blue 
collar 
workers 
of 

Michigan have not forgotten that,” 
he said. “This factor may also have 
contributed to high millennial 
turnout despite the fact that many 
campuses are on vacation this 
week.”

Echoing this idea, Shipan said 

Sanders’ message resonates with 
blue-collar workers in Michigan 
who feel that they have been 

slighted.

“Sanders’ message resonates 

more in Michigan than in some 
of the earlier states due to the fact 
that Michigan workers have the 
perception that they have been 
hurt more by trade deals in the 
past,” he said.

As the election cycle continues, 

with four more states headed to 
the polls or to caucus in the next 
week alone, the question remains 
whether Sanders’ performance in 
Michigan should be seen as a one-
time occurrence, or an indication 
for how he will do in the remainder 
of the race.

Communications Studies Prof. 

Josh Pasek said since the Sanders 
campaign has a large base of small 
donors and remains well-funded, 
the senator will likely remain in the 
race until the convention in July.

However, Pasek said despite his 

ability to stay in the race and recent 
successes, he is likely too far behind 
Clinton in the delegate count to win 
the nomination.

Currently, Sanders has 574 

delegates. 
Clinton 
has 
1,222 

delegates, though 461 of those are 
superdelegates, who pledge support 
independent of voter outcomes and 
can switch candidates at any times. 

2,383 delegates are required to 
secure the Democratic nomination.

“The problem for Bernie is if 

he fares just as well as he did in 
Michigan for the remainder of the 
race, he will lose by a considerable 
margin,” he said. “It appears — 
based on Michigan — that he is 
improving his performance, but it 
is not clear if that improvement is 
enough that he can actually win the 
nomination at this point.”

Students for Hillary outreach 

director Anushka Sarkar, an LSA 
sophomore, said the group is 
proud of Clinton’s performance 
overall in Tuesday’sprimaries as 
she ended the night with more 
delegates. Students for Hillary will 
continue campaigning for Clinton 
moving forward in the election by 
holding phone banks including one 
tomorrow aimed at Ohio voters 
given the state’s upcoming primary. 

“We are very proud of the 

secretary’s performance because 
she came out ahead in the net 
delegate total,” she said. “In 
Michigan she had a very close 
competition, and we congratulate 
Sanders on winning the state. We 
are looking forward to winning 
in Ohio and will keep chucking 
forward.”

workshops 
and 
panels. 
These 

smaller 
groups 
talked 
about 

bystander intervention, evidence-
based treatment for depression, 
relationships and ways to support 
students with autism. About 50 
attendees made up each group, most 
of whom were professionals, faculty 
or graduate students in the field of 
psychology.

However, even though there 

were low numbers of undergraduate 
attendees, many of the speakers 
were undergraduate students.

A discussion on relationships, 

called Relationship Remix, was 
among the least formal of the 
panels. The gender breakdown of 
the audience was notably skewed 
toward women, with only about 
four men in attendance out of the 
fifty total attendees.

Anne 
Huhman, 
program 

manager at the University’s Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center, said though the number of 
men in this group was low, it was 
important to continue to include as 
many identities as possible in these 
discussions.

“One thing that we’re trying 

to do by gathering feedback from 
our colleagues is get that range of 
identities in the room, including 
men,” she said.

Among the topics discussed 

were consent, safe sex and how to 

communicate in a healthy way.

When going over healthy options 

for engaging in safe relationships, 
LSA senior Madison McCullough, 
a Relationship Remix leader, said 
UHS offers many options for 
students

“Many University of Michigan 

students are not having sex,” she 
said. “You can choose to have sex 
less often, or with less partners, or 
get the HPV vaccine, which UHS 
offers.”

After the panel, LSA junior Emily 

Liu, a SAPAC member, echoed 
Huhman’s 
sentiments, 
saying 

the conversation may have been 
different with more undergraduates 
in the room.

“It’s funny to think about how 

this (discussion) might differ with 
students,” Liu said.

Many of the speakers stressed 

that mental health is an issue that 
needs to be addressed on not only 
on the University’s campus, but also 
campuses across the country.

Laura McAndrew, sexual health 

educator at Wolverine Wellness, 
said mental health is an ongoing 
issue for young people that requires 
further discussion and focus.

“Mental 
health 
for 
college 

students is a huge factor in their 
wellness, in their academic success 
and in their well-being during their 
time in school.” McAndrew said. 
“So it’s a really complex issue that 
requires a really complex set of 
solutions to try to improve mental 
health for students.”

DEPRESSION

father figures could benefit 
African-American 
youth 

and 
protect 
them 
from 

compromising 
health 

behaviors.

“African-American 
male 

youth are at risk for a number 
of poor health outcomes,” 
Caldwell said. “The approach 
that we are taking to address 
this problem involves not only 
the child, but also his father 
who doesn’t live with him … 
Although the father does not 
live in the household with the 
child, he is there to provide 
support for the child, and the 
intervention that we do with 
the fathers helps him in terms 
of improving his parenting 
behaviors.”

The Fathers and Sons project 

currently uses a community 
based 
participatory 

research 
process, 
meaning 

its 
organizers 
work 
with 

community partners including 
community organizations in 
Flint, the Genesee County 
Health Department and the 
University’s School of Public 
Health.

Cassandra Brooks, project 

manager 
for 
Fathers 
and 

Sons, said the project serves 
many 
different 
purposes 

crucial to the enhancement of 

African-American father-son 
relationship development.

“One (purpose) is to reduce 

negative 
health 
behaviors, 

and particularly in the son, 
such as early sexual initiation, 
introduction 
to 
violence, 

substance use, things like that,” 
Brooks said. “Also, to promote 
positive 
health 
outcomes, 

better communication skills, 
better 
identity 
with 
their 

culture (and) better dialogue 
between fathers and sons.”

E. Hill De Leony, director 

of the Flint Odyssey House 
Health 
Awareness 
Center, 

said 
she 
thought 
Fathers 

and Sons was an important 
program for the community 
because of the United States’ 
history of African-American 
enslavement. Because of this, 
many African Americans had 
not received an education, had 
no real work experience and 
often could not read.

De 
Leony 
said 
despite 

equality efforts made from the 
Emancipation Proclamation to 
the Civil Rights Act, African-
American 
males 
had, 
and 

still have, difficulty getting 
jobs to support their families, 
resulting in negative effects on 
African-American families as 
a unit.

She added that she believes 

society has made it seem as 
though a family has to have 

both a father and a mother 
in the home, furthering the 
negative 
perception 
about 

having fathers not in the home. 

“Society also said that if 

they’re nonresidential, they 
didn’t care about their families 
because they’re glad to be 
away,” De Leony said. “Our 
research proves that’s not 
true. They want to be with 
their families, and they are 
committed … there’s some 
obstacles 
that 
kept 
them 

away that we address in our 
research project, so we reduce 
or eliminate those problems.”

Along with the program’s 

components 
of 
performing 

community 
service 
and 

engaging 
in 
small 
group 

discussion, Caldwell said she 
thought 
African-American 

history is also an imperative 
topic to focus on in intervention 
efforts.

“Within this intervention, 

we 
also 
have 
tailored 
it 

specifically 
for 
African-

American families, because 
we take a cultural approach 
in terms of the activities that 
we do, some of the issues 
that we discuss, some of the 
ways that fathers are focused 
on parenting their sons, for 
example, 
with 
regard 
to 

race socialization,” Caldwell 
said. “This intervention can 
eventually be adapted to other 

ethnic groups as well.”

In 
Chicago, 
the 
project 

is slated to follow a similar 
approach as the program in 
Flint, with several additions — 
the group also plans to use the 
grant to collect long-term data 
through pretests and post-
tests, as well as six-month, 
12-month and 18-month follow-
up evaluation data collection to 
examine the long-term effects 
of the intervention.

“Our goal is to release this 

project so that it becomes 
a model for the nation once 
we are able to scientifically 
demonstrate the components 
of the intervention that are 
effective,” Caldwell said.

Brooks said she thought 

Fathers and Sons is different 
from other intervention and 
prevention programs because 
it includes family members, 
such as mothers and legal 
guardians, to aid productive 
communication between the 
father and son.

“It’s an important project 

because it’s bringing families 
together,” 
Brooks 
said. 

“Oftentimes, when a father 
does not live in the same 
home with their son they are 
considered 
to 
be 
absentee 

fathers, and a nonresidential 
father and an absentee father 
are not the same thing.”

T

he winter of my freshman 
year, I met a boy in class 
who I liked. Let’s call him 

Greg. We got along well, held 
similar family values and both 
ran 
Instagram 

accounts 
for 

our pet dogs. It 
was a perfect 
match, 
right? 

Despite the fact 
that Greg and 
I spent endless 
time together in 
social 
settings 

and in the UGLi, 
our relationship 
never 
seemed 

to 
progress. 

Almost a full year later, deep 
into a serious relationship with 
a different boy, I decided to ask 
Greg why he had never seemed to 
reciprocate my obvious affection. 
“I liked hanging out with you, but 
I really didn’t want to commit to 
anything,” he casually wrote me 
over text. All this time I’d been 
thinking Greg never liked me 
when, in reality, Greg was scared 
I might hoodwink him into being 
my boyfriend.

In my experience, one of my 

generation’s 
favorite 
activities 

is 
complaining 
about 
hookup 

culture. Recently, however, I have 
noticed a common misconception 
about hookup culture: a gap 
between the genders. Women have 
come to believe that all men want 
is an easy lay and then to ignore 
them on the Diag. Meanwhile, 

men have come to believe that all 
a woman wants is an emotional 
connection and a bouquet of roses 
on Valentine’s Day.

Love is a complicated game and 

the dating scene at Michigan is 
extremely hard to navigate, but this 
strong set of beliefs often doesn’t 
hold true. I have heard stories: 
“Every time he takes someone to 
a date party, he takes them out 
to dinner beforehand — isn’t that 
weird?” That’s right ladies, there is 
a boy out there who wants to take 
you out on a date. Girls have grown 
accustomed to feelings of confusion 
and surprise when a boy shows 
genuine interest and even — gasp! 
— desire to get a meal with them. 
My personal favorite line used on a 
female friend recently: “Maybe we 
could do something sober together 
next week.”

Meanwhile, in “girl world” as 

they call it in Tina Fey’s “Mean 
Girls,” 
the 
complete 
opposite 

development 
is 
happening. 

Newsflash for the gentlemen: 
Not all women are trying to tie 
you down for life! College-aged 
“dudes” are afraid their friends 
might 
tease 
them 
for 
being 

“whipped,” meaning they’ll do 
anything for their girl, or “wifed-
up,” meaning they and their 
partners act like a married couple. 
I have watched countless boys lose 
their opportunities with great girls 
because they fear they are walking 
into a relationship. Just as much 
as guys sometimes want an “easy 
lay,” so do girls. I’d even argue a 

double standard exists. Boys are 
constantly judged for using girls 
for sex, but girls manage to avoid 
judgment when they do the same.

We 
have 
to 
stop 
making 

assumptions about someone of 
the opposite sex’s agenda because 
it might be completely different 
from what one may expect. I’ve 
been in situations where a boy 
is trying to tie me down and I 
am trying to be free, and vice 
versa. It is difficult not to make 
assumptions when getting to know 
someone, but these assumptions 
hurt our ability to progress. 
These 
assumptions 
cause 
us 

harm, as we lose opportunities 
on both sides. We are losing 
opportunities to form good, strong 
relationships, and opportunities 
to have expectations-free sex from 
someone we are attracted to, but 
not necessarily interested in for a 
relationship.

So men, I urge you to be open-

minded toward women’s affection, 
and to not assume she wants a 
relationship, because she may not. 
And women, I urge you to be open-
minded toward men’s affection. 
Don’t assume he wants sex and 
nothing else. People will surprise 
you. Until you talk through it, or 
not talk about it at all and instead 
focus on the physical, you can’t make 
decisions to start or end a relationship 
without the other person involved in 
those very decisions.

Y

ou consider your family:

1. Upper class
2. Middle class

3. Lower class
Every 
time 

I 
encounter 
a 

question 
like 

the one above, 
I’m 
stupified. 

The distinction 
between classes 
is so ambiguous 
and 
my 

experiences 
so 

unquantifiable 
that 
I 
never 

quite know how 
to answer.

Like 47 percent of the U.S. 

population, 
I 
considered 
my 

family solidly “middle class” for 
most of my adolescent life — I 
hadn’t realized there are actually 
four distinct middle classes. I 
grew up in a small farm town that 
my dad had never left and that 
my mom had moved to from the 
outskirts of Jackson County. For 
the first 12 years of my life, my dad 
owned and operated a sheet metal 
fabrication business on the edge of 
the village limits. After marrying 
my dad, my mom worked as the 
shop secretary. It was the 1990s 
and the manufacturing industry 
was booming.

In 1992, my parents bought a 

one-bathroom, 
two-bedroom, 

three-story house on Main Street 
in Parma, MI for around $30,000. 
By 1996, my parents had four kids, 
a house double its original size and 
a 
successful 
industry-centered 

business.

During my early elementary 

years, my family had a weekly 
housekeeper, two lots we rented 
at a campground an hour away, a 
large-sized boat (paid for in cash) 
and three gas-guzzling vehicles. 
Presents littered our backroom 
Christmas 
morning 
and 
our 

birthdays were lavishly celebrated.

Though I’ve never asked my 

parents about their annual income 
during the first years of my life, 
I know they made more than the 
people we acquainted ourselves 
with. My sister, brothers and I 
reminisce on this period of our 
lives as the glory days: In my naive, 
childish 
perception, 
we 
were 

Parma’s version of “upper class.” 
But really, it was the beginning of 
the end.

Less 
than 
10 
years 
later, 

a 
combination 
of 
mental 

illnesses, 
addiction, 
financial 

irresponsibility, 
ignorance 
and 

systematic influences led to a 
drastic change in our lives.

By 2006, my parents struggled 

to put food on our table. My dad 
lost his fabrication shop and 
was consumed by debt. Both my 
dad and my youngest brother, 
separately, spent a week in the 
hospital, resulting in astronomical 
medical bills. The campground 
we had once vacationed at nearly 
every weekend held our camper 
as collateral for the money my 
parents owed. Child Protective 
Services 
visited 
our 
house 

claiming our toilets didn’t work 
and that my parents had no food to 
feed us.

My mother dragged my brothers 

and I along as she picked up 
random custodial jobs in the area: 
the Vietnam veteran’s residence in 
the trailer park down the street; 
the giant Methodist church in 
the town north of ours; the fur-
covered, nearly-condemned trailer 
of the angry old man with shingles. 
Meanwhile, our own house looked 
like an animal shelter littered with 
remnants of junk food. The bank 
sent several foreclosure notices. 
My dad borrowed money to keep 
our home. 

However, in the second half of 

2008, our economic status shifted 
once again — this time for the better. 

My mom secured a stable job 

(that she still has to this day) and 
my dad controlled his drinking 
enough to hold a credible reputation 
with his employer. My parents were 
constantly fighting, but our family 
was able to retain some normalcy. 
Things seemed OK for the time being.

When I first applied to FAFSA 

during my senior year of high school 
in 2011, according to the numbers, 
my family was probably considered 
upper-middle class. Though physically 
separated, my parents were not legally 
separated, and so their combined 
income was about $100,000 — well 
above Michigan’s current median 
household income of $49,847. During 
my first semester of college, my family 
was expected to contribute over 
$4,000 to my education, an amount 
that’s easily attainable for most higher-
income families.

Yet, two days before moving 

into my dormitory, my dad was 
permanently “laid off” from his job 
of five years. My 21-year-old sister 

and her newly-wedded husband 
were struggling to support their 
two children. My youngest brother 
was constantly in legal trouble. I 
was the only one in my family who 
wanted to go to college; putting 
aside money for my education when 
we lived day-by-day was a joke.

Since 
then, 
my 
family’s 

economic struggles have been an 
uphill battle. In the 10 semesters 
I have been enrolled at the 
University, I have yet to pay the 
remaining balance on my account 
— my expected family contribution 
— on time. Each semester, I 
become more and more anxious, 
constantly calling my mom as the 
end of the semester approaches. 
In the second semester of my 
sophomore year, my mom couldn’t 
afford the $2,000 we still owed. I 
took out a personal loan through 
our local credit union and made 
monthly payments for two years 
until it was paid off.

Today, I don’t know what to call 

myself.

My dad works as a welder at a 

car-parts factory. My stepmom is a 
third-shift stocker at Meijer. Their 
combined income is part of the 
“working middle-class.”

My mom still works at the 

company she applied to in 2008. 
Her salary has only increased as 
the years have passed. Last year, 
she married my now-stepdad, who 
works in a top managerial position 
in his industry. Combined, they 
make more than 90 percent of 
what most U.S. households earn: 
definitely upper-class. 

For the past three years — before 

my 
stepmom 
started 
working

FROM THE DAILY

Budget fails to help schools in need 

Higher-ed funding increased, but evaluations remain unfair
G

ov. Rick Snyder cut 15 percent of higher-education funding 
at the beginning of his first term as governor of Michigan 
in 2011, heavily affecting 15 public universities and colleges, 

including the University of Michigan. Snyder has since incrementally 
increased state funding for higher education, and the increase 
proposed for the 2017 budget will allow funding levels to return to 
those of 2011. Funding allocated to higher education will increase 
by $61.2 million, with a cap on public university tuition hikes at 
4.8 percent as a condition for receiving some of the funds. This is 
uncharacteristically generous compared to last year’s $28 million in 
funding and a 3.2-percent cap on tuition increases.

However, it is important to note that not all 

schools benefit equally from this increase in 
funding. Instead, schools are evaluated and 
deemed deserving of different levels of funding 
based on criteria that deceivingly slights some 
schools. While it is encouraging to Michigan 
residents that stronger efforts are being made 
to support the state’s higher education system, 
measurement of each university’s performance 
should correspond to each university’s specific 
goals and demographic composition.

Schools receive funding for two different 

purposes: costs of everyday operation and 
performance-based spending. Operational 
funding is tied to university activities and 
helps 
run 
schools, 
while 
performance 

funding is incentivized by a standardized 
performance evaluation — and performance 
funding is the type Snyder is increasing with 
his new budget proposal.

This 
type 
of 
funding 
takes 
three 

categories into consideration for each school: 
undergraduate degree completions in critical 
skills 
areas, 
research 
and 
development 

expenses and national rankings to Carnegie 
peers. National rankings depend upon six-year 
graduation rates, total degree completions, 
institutional support and number of Pell 
Grant recipients from each school. The 
highest-performing schools in all categories 
subsequently receive the highest percentage 
increase in funding, but this trend punishes 
schools that perform poorly by denying them 
the appropriate funds to succeed in the future.

Students at such schools are suffering as 

well. Schools such as Wayne State University 
and Grand Valley State University, which tend 
to perform the worst on the standardized 
criteria for funding evaluation — including 
graduation and retention rates — are the same 
schools dedicated to admitting students from 
urban areas. The goal of increased funding is 
to better support universities and colleges, but 
the current system ultimately benefits those 
already doing well and harms those who need 
more assistance.

Wayne State University is expecting 

this year to be the fifth consecutive year 
yielding the statewide lowest percentage 
of funding increase. Wayne State follows a 

mission statement rooted in helping at-risk 
students, and therefore cannot compete 
with 
the 
schools 
receiving 
the 
most 

funding. It is slated to receive a 3.5-percent 
increase. This is contrary to the schools 
receiving the most funding, such as Grand 
Valley State University, which is planned to 
receive 6.8-percent increase. These schools 
are intentionally designed to do well on 
evaluations such as the performance funding 
model.

In addition to hurting schools who have 

fewer resources but also have goals to aid 
students of lower socioeconomic status, the 
current evaluation system rewards schools that 
have previously disregarded the tuition cap set 
by the state. Oakland University, for example, is 
scheduled for a 6.1-percent increase in funding, 
despite raising tuition last year above the 
maximum 3.2-percent increase.

The current system used to evaluate schools’ 

performances is too standardized. It does 
not account for the unique needs of certain 
institutions that cater to students who simply 
cannot compete with students from other 
institutions. Ultimately, the current metrics 
funding model does not adequately meet 
the needs of all students. Rather, it gives the 
biggest benefit through a large sum of money to 
students who already attend colleges capable of 
offering superb education.

It is refreshing to see Snyder acting to benefit 

Michigan residents, but the execution of this 
funding plan prevents those in most dire need 
of funding from getting the appropriate and fair 
amount. Though the idea of doling out funds 
based on meritocracy does not need to change, 
the value of such funds given to schools cannot 
be determined by a standardized test that 
cannot possibly take the school’s personal goals 
and situation into consideration.

The manner in which schools are evaluated 

for increased funding should instead be more 
individualized. A new evaluation system 
should be adopted to allow schools to be 
judged based on how well they are meeting 
their own goals given their individual 
circumstances, rather than how well they fit 
into the current mold.

‘M’ heads to Hawaii

Wolverines play 
four games in 

Honolulu for first 

time ever

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

will be flying over, and to, 
uncharted waters this weekend. 

The 19th-ranked Wolverines 

will 
travel 

to 
Honolulu 

to 
face 
the 

University 
of 

Hawaii for the 
first time since 
2008 
— 
and 

just the second 
time 
ever. 

The last time 
Michigan and 
the 
Rainbow 

Warriors 
met 
was 
at 

the 
Arizona 

State 
Coca-

Cola 
Classic 

tournament, where the then-
18th ranked Wolverines stole 
the game, 11-5. 

Since then, however, a new 

face has taken over the program 
from former Michigan coach 
Rich Maloney. 

“I’ve 
never 
coached 
or 

played a game (in Hawaii),” 
said 
fourth-year 
Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “I spent a 
lot of times calling coaches who 
have coached there multiple 
times asking about how to best 
prepare for the time change. 

“Another thing I heard quite 

often from other coaches and 

players is that when you’re 
coming from the Eastern or 
Central time zones, you need to 
build in some down time, some 
rest time, some nap time. I think 
that’s important for conserving 
their energy and making sure 
that they have everything they 
got for game time.” 

To adjust to the time zones, 

the team shifted its training 
hours this past week so that 
practice was at night and 
academic work was in the 
afternoon. It seems like a 
minor adjustment — typically 
the schedule is reversed — but 
the first game is at 6:30 p.m. 
Hawaii time, which is 11:30 p.m. 
Eastern time. The new training 
schedule is helping the players 
adjust to competing later in the 
night. 

According to the advisory 

coaches, it’s important to get 
the players some beach time, but 
they warned that it’s imperative 
the players get out of the sun 
before the heat kicks in mid-day.

But the goal isn’t just to get a 

tan. It’s still about baseball.

“We’re just looking to make 

more positive strides, that’s what 
we talked to the team about,” 
Bakich said. “To continue to 
advance the program, (and) to 
continue to get better.” 

The team is looking to improve 

on 
execution 
and 
getting 

the pitchers to continuously 
attack the zone. Even more 
importantly, Bakich is looking 
to improve defensively. 

This 
year, 
Michigan 
is 

heading into the series with a 
7-3 overall record — a promising 
start considering its opponents’ 
6-7 start to its season. As of 

now, Hawaii is batting .299 
while posting a 4.49 earned-
run average through 13 games. 
A Rainbow Warrior to watch 
will be senior infielder Jacob 
Sheldon Collins, who boasts a 
.404 batting average and a .429 
on-base percentage. 

Michigan 
will 
send 

sophomore left-hander Oliver 
Jaskie 
to 
the 
mound 
first 

on 
Thursday, 
since 
Jaskie 

hasn’t pitched since Feb. 29 at 
California. The Wolverines will 
follow with left-hander Brett 
Adcock on Friday and Ryan 
Nutof and left-hander Evan Hill 
for Saturday. The defense will 
have the same 10 players that 
have consistently started. 

With more than two weeks 

until Michigan’s home opener, 
the Wolverines will have to be 
comfortable on the road for now.

Redshirt junior Mike McCray should play a much larger role at linebacker this fall.
New linebacking 
corps ready for a 
challenge in 2016

With Morgan, Ross 
and Bolden gone, 
young group takes 
over in new season

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

When looking for statistics to 

explain the Michigan football 
team’s success in 2015, a few 
jump out right away: Three 
straight 
shutouts. 
Fourth-

fewest total yards allowed in 
the nation. Only one touchdown 
conceded in a 41-7 Citrus Bowl 
victory over Florida.

There’s 
no 
question 
the 

Wolverines’ 
biggest 
strength 

was their defense, led by then-
defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 

Durkin, who has since parlayed 
that success into a head coaching 
job at Maryland. To replace 
him this year, all Michigan did 
was hire former Boston College 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown, whose 2015 defense was 
the best in the nation.

Under Brown’s leadership, the 

Wolverines believe they have a 
chance to be just as good — or 
better — in 2016. Nearly the entire 
defensive line will return, as will 
most of the secondary. Even 
the departure of hard-hitting 
defensive 
tackle 
Willie 

Henry, 
who 

forwent 
his 

final season of 
eligibility 
to 

enter the NFL 
Draft, could be 
offset by the 
arrival of No. 1 
recruit Rashan 
Gary, 
who 

plays the same 
position.

However, 
one 
looming 

challenge 
remains 
for 
the 

defense. With the graduation 
of 
linebackers 
Joe 
Bolden, 

Desmond Morgan and James 
Ross, 
Michigan’s 
most 

experienced 
position 
group 

suddenly becomes its least.

In order to maintain the level 

of performance it enjoyed last 
season, the defense will have to 
find a way to replace a trio that 
accounted for 758 career tackles 
— 189 last year alone. To do so, 
the Wolverines will need to rely 
on a combination of returning 
talent and fresh blood.

It will also have to do so 

under new leadership, as Chris 
Partridge replaces Durkin as 
linebackers coach.

Five practices into Michigan’s 

spring 
season, 
Partridge 
is 

well aware of the challenge, 
but he doesn’t seem worried at 
all. In fact, he’s enjoying the 
experience.

“It’s 
awesome,” 
Partridge 

said. “And then Coach Brown is 
there with me, with the backers, 
and he’s a seasoned, veteran 
coach that understands how 
to get guys ready to go. So, it’s 
been pretty smooth. They’re 
working hard.”

Even the Wolverines’ most 

veteran backers — senior Ben 
Gedeon 
and 
redshirt 
junior 

Mike McCray — have very little 
starting experience this late in 
their careers. 

Though Gedeon has made 42 

appearances and registered 70 
tackles over the last three years, 
he has started only one game. 
McCray, on the other hand, has 
appeared in just 11 games and 
recorded two tackles. He didn’t 
see the field at all last season 
because of a shoulder injury.

Despite their meager career 

statistics, though, both players 
turned heads last week with 
their play during Michigan’s 
practices at IMG Academy in 
Bradenton, Fla. 

“Ben Gedeon has stepped in 

and been an incredible leader 
right off the bat,” Partridge said. 
“(McCray) has been incredible 
the first five practices. He’s a 
pleasant surprise. You kinda 
knew he had it in him, and his 
first five practices have been 
phenomenal.”

If Gedeon and McCray are 

as 
good 
as 

advertised, 
the remaining 
challenge will 
be to get some 
of the younger 
players 
acclimated. 

Partridge 

said that all 
freshman 
recruits 
will 

have 
the 

opportunity to compete for a job, 
citing linebacker Devin Bush — 
a 6-foot, 200-pound freshman 
from Pemberton Pines, Fla. — as 
a player who has adjusted well to 
the college environment so far 
and will be “looked highly upon” 
to contribute this season. 

And if that doesn’t work 

out, the Wolverines even seem 
willing to play their ever-present 
wild card: do-it-all safety Jabrill 
Peppers, who played multiple 
reps at linebacker in Bradenton 
last week.

Replacing 
last 
year’s 

linebackers is no easy task, but 
it’s one Michigan is already 
willing to tackle head-on, even if 
it has to get creative to do so.

“It’s 
what 
I 
live 
for,” 

Partridge 
said. 
“I 
love 
it. 

When I came in here, it was a 
challenge. I’m a competitor — I 
wouldn’t want it any other way. 
We’ll get those guys going, we’ll 
take on the challenge and we’ll 
make it work.”

“I love it. When 

I came in 

here, it was a 
challenge.”

Wildcats up first in Indy

Michigan takes on 
Northwestern in 

second round of Big 

Ten Tournament

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

It’s March — the magical 

month when every team entering 
a conference tournament has 
at 
least 
one 

conceptual 
path 
to 

the 
NCAA 

Tournament, 
even a national 
championship, 
if it can just 
keep winning.

If 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team is going 
to 
reach 

the 
NCAA 

Tournament, however, it needs 
to create some madness of its 
own. When the Wolverines tip 
off their Big Ten Tournament 
slate 
against 
Northwestern 

in Indianapolis on Thursday, 
they’ll know a single win likely 
won’t be enough for a ticket to 
the Big Dance.

To secure an at-large bid, 

Michigan would also need to win 
the next day against top-seeded 
Indiana, creating an instant 
catch-22. To beat Northwestern, 
the 
Wolverines 
might 
need 

their starters to give everything 
left in the tank. To beat the 
Hoosiers, Michigan likely needs 
its starters to have fresh legs, 
especially since Indiana will 
have been off since Sunday.

“You can’t balance it,” said 

junior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
“You give it your all every time. 
No matter who’s off and who’s 
having to play, guys are tired at 
this point, either way it goes. To 

make that excuse would just be 
a cop-out.”

The 
circumstances 
are 

different this time, but Michigan 
has won two or more Big Ten 
Tournament games only once 
in coach John Beilein’s eight 
attempts.

To even try for two, though, 

the Wolverines 
first 
need 

to 
quiet 
the 

Wildcats. 
Northwestern 
presents 
a 

sizable obstacle 
in its own right, 
especially 
center 
Alex 

Olah, who has 
developed 
a 

reputation as a Wolverine killer 
over the course of his career. In his 
last three games against Michigan 
dating back to the 2014-15 season, 
Olah is averaging 22 points and 
eight rebounds.

Much of the scoring has come 

from mid-range jump shots that 
most Big Ten centers wouldn’t 
even attempt, and has proved 
particularly tough to defend for 

the Wolverines in particular.

“The way we hedge ball 

screens — he’s been doing a 
good job taking advantage of 
that,” said junior forward Mark 
Donnal. “Most of his shots 
are coming from jump shots. 
There’s little coming from inside 
the paint his last few games. I 

think we need 
to 
adjust 

(our) 
help 

defensively so 
we can slow 
him down a 
little bit.”

Olah scored 

19 points in 
Michigan’s 
72-63 win on 
Feb. 
24, 
in 

which the Wolverines struggled 
to recover from an 11-0 deficit 
early on after missing their 
first eight field goals. A pair 
of 
second-half 
threes 
from 

sophomore 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins, who combined with 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman to score 30 
points, put the Wildcats away.

Michigan’s mentality entering 

this weekend is substantially 
different from that in its last two 
trips to the Big Ten Tournament. 
In 
2013-14, 
the 
Wolverines 

finished 
the 
regular 
season 

and secured in their NCAA 
Tournament 
bid, 
and 
had 

relatively little to gain through 
their 
conference 
tournament 

performance. 
Last 
season, 

Michigan entered knowing it 
needed to win the tournament 
with four victories in four days.

This year, the Wolverines’ 

must-do list is more realistic, 
though still unlikely. Needing 
just a pair of wins has Michigan 
playing 
with 
a 
sense 
of 

desperation it hasn’t needed at 
a Big Ten Tournament for years.

“We hope so,” Beilein said of 

the no-holds-barred mentality. 
“We’re trying to just go down 
there and win it all. If your 
team’s not very good and you’re 
down in the bottom half of the 
league, the chances are that 
you’re not making it to Saturday 
night. If your team is really 
good, they’re probably already in 
the NCAA Tournament. The real 
crown has been done.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan working 
on preventing fouls

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

In the Michigan women’s 

basketball 
team’s 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament matchup against 
Iowa, the Hawkeyes used a 
steady diet of hard cuts off 
of passes to draw fouls in the 
first quarter. Iowa kept doing 
it — rinse, lather, repeat — until 
junior guard Siera Thompson 
fell victim early, picking up her 
first foul and checking out of the 
game soon thereafter.

Fouls have plagued Michigan 

all season long, and in coach Kim 
Barnes Arico’s interview with 
Inside Michigan Basketball on 
Monday, that’s exactly what the 
discussion focused on — mainly 
keeping players from picking up 
fouls and when to take them out 
of games.

In the matchup against the 

Hawkeyes, it was especially 
unusual for Thompson to pick 
up a healthy dose of fouls. She 
averages just two per game and 
is touted as the Wolverines’ best 
defender, counted on to shut 
down her opponent without 
fouling. But as soon as she put her 
hands up to defend, the whistle 
blew. After the point guard and 
team captain headed to the 
bench, Michigan’s dynamic was 
never the same.

Sometimes, when players pick 

up fouls, they’ll tell their coach to 
keep them in and to trust them, 
wanting to continue playing for 
their team. Ultimately for Barnes 
Arico, it’s her decision, based on a 
player’s experience and prowess 
for evading foul trouble.

“I think it depends on the 

person,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 

“With (freshman center) Hallie 
Thome, when she picks up her 
first foul, we take her right out of 
the way because we know they’re 
attacking her right away. She’s 
young, she’s a freshman.

“When we have (Thompson) 

who plays that many minutes for 
us, we’re a totally different team 
without her. She’s a junior, she’s 
averaged 36 minutes in her career 
since she stepped onto campus 
running the team for us. So when 
she’s not in the game, we’re a 
really different team.”

Barnes 
Arico 
was 
hoping 

Thompson would be able to avoid 
Iowa’s goal of drawing fouls on 
her and that her point guard 
would stay out of foul trouble like 
she has all season. Thompson’s 
defense 
has 
been 
invaluable 

all season, shutting down or 
slowing the progress of stars 
like Minnesota guard Rachel 
Banham, who set a Big Ten record 
with 60 points in another game 
this season. But Thompson, and 
therefore the rest of the team, did 
not recover Thursday.

“It’s really important that you 

know your team,” Barnes Arico 
said. “With Siera, I thought she 
was going to be OK. We switched 
her matchup, we took her off 
their best player, and they were 
experienced and went at her and 
that really hurt us.”

The outing was a fluke for 

Thompson. 
It’s 
usually 
the 

Michigan bigs like Thome and 
senior forward Kelsey Mitchell 
who find themselves in foul 
trouble, coming out of the game 
when their presence is needed 
the most. With the WNIT on the 
horizon, the Wolverines have 
been working on defense and 
breakdown drills to play more 
aggressively without the ball and 
without fouling.

For Michigan to make a deep 

run in the WNIT, it’ll need to be 
mentally tough to avoid picking 
up fouls that can be prevented. 
Michigan is determined to work 
on it, because even if it’s not 
where it would like to be at this 
point in the season, there is still 
more basketball to play.

SOFTBALL
Sobczak answers the call

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

Heading into the season, the 

No. 2 Michigan softball team had 
few question marks on its roster.

It knew which pitchers would 

be throwing fastballs from the 
circle. It knew who would be 
catching the ground balls and 
making double plays in the infield. 
And it knew the players in charge 
of manning the outfield grass.

It was not certain, however, 

who 
would 
replace 
the 

Wolverines’ 
departed 
starting 

catcher of the previous four years: 
Lauren Sweet.

Through 20 games, freshman 

catcher Alex Sobczak looks to 
have filled the void in Michigan’s 
veteran-heavy lineup.

In 37 at-bats, Sobczak has hit 

.270 with two home runs and 13 
RBI with just four strikeouts.

Before 
the 
season 
began, 

Sobczak expressed concern about 
her potential impact, but she soon 
realized that high school softball 
and college softball are similar in 
many ways.

“I was worried coming in 

because (we face) All-American 
pitchers and there’s going to be 
such a difference — and such 
a change — but it’s actually 
just the same,” Sobczak said 
on Wednesday. “The pitchers 
throw a little bit harder and the 
movement is a little bit greater, 
but (our team) has gotten so much 
better as hitters — just focusing on 
the ball — that I don’t really notice 
too big of a difference.”

Where 
there 
is 
a 
clear 

difference, though, is in the 
personalities of the bubbly Sweet 
compared to the quiet Sobczak.

While Sweet was often vocal 

in the dugout, junior right-hander 
Megan Betsa points out that 
Sobczak leads in other ways.

“Alex isn’t the verbal catcher 

that Lauren Sweet was,” Betsa 
said. “She’s more of a lead-by- 
example type of catcher, and I 
think that’s good because we have 
a lot of vocal leaders on the field, 
(and it gives us) a good balance.”

Sobczak 
has 
experience 

behind 
the 
plate 
for 
every 

Michigan starter this season and 

thus understands the importance 
of forging connections with the 
pitchers, each of whom have 
different needs, strengths and 
weaknesses.

“I think that’s been the coolest 

thing so far,” Sobczak said. “Being 
a freshman, they don’t know you 
coming in, and getting to have a 
different relationship with Tera 
(Blanco), Leah (Crockett), Sara 
(Driesenga) and Meg (Betsa). 
It’s 
weird 
catching 
pitchers 

for the first time, because you 
(personally) have to make that 
relationship.” 

While some players may shy 

away from comparisons to an 
esteemed 
player 
like 
Sweet, 

Sobczak embraces it. In the fall, 
she had the opportunity to speak 
with Sweet, whom she called her 
“role model.”

“Lauren Sweet is awesome,” 

Sobczak said. “I talked to her 
about controlling and leading 
the team because that’s what you 
do behind the plate. You’re in 
charge of everything, and that’s 
a very hard position to walk into 
as a freshman. You have to know 
every play and every person.

“She pretty much told me to 

relax, to own my position and 
embrace it … that it’s OK not to 
know everything at the start, just 
do what you know how to do.”

Another 
core 
aspect 
of 

Sobczak’s development involves 
visits 
to 
the 
circle. 
These 

conversations can be used to 
motivate, assist or calm down a 
struggling pitcher.

Sometimes, 
though, 
the 

pitchers themselves utilize the 
trips to the circle to mentor their 
young catcher.

While the talks usually initiate 

with the catcher coming to the 
mound on her own conviction, 
Michigan’s pitchers sometimes 
call the conference themselves. 
Betsa 
and 
Driesenga, 
now 

veterans 
compared 
to 
their 

catcher, call time and allow 
Sobczak to gather herself.

Sobczak now plays the catcher 

position 
regularly, 
which 
is 

a major difference from her 
experience in travel ball, where 
she also played third base.

That 
was 
not 
the 
only 

adjustment for the freshman, 
though. She also needed to get 
acquainted to more than just the 
speed and pace of the college game.

“You’re in front of a lot more 

people, and the pressure is 
definitely a lot more (because) 
you’re fighting for a national 
championship,” Sobczak said. “In 
high school and travel, you’re not 
playing for nearly as much.”

According to Michigan coach 

Carol Hutchins, Sobczak has the 
potential to impact the team, but 
she simply needs to continue to 
improve and grow.

While the current Wolverines 

are reminded of the outgoing and 
confident Sweet in the dugout, 
Hutchins remembers a drastically 
different Sweet as a freshman.

“None of the kids on this team 

knew Sweet as a freshman,” 
Hutchins said. “Lauren didn’t 
have nearly the presence that 
she had by the time she was a 
junior and a senior, and that 
comes from confidence and 
trusting your game. And right 
now it’s really typical, freshmen 
are just trying to keep their head 
above water.”

Hutchins also explained that, 

compared to other positions, 
catcher proves to be the most 
challenging to grasp for freshmen 
in particular.

“(Catcher 
is) 
the 
biggest 

learning curve on the field,” 
Hutchins said. “There’s a lot 
going on, the pace of our team 
is 
extremely 
fast, 
and 
that 

information can really get into 
kids’ heads. (Sobczak is) going 
through a lot of the things 
that (Sweet) went through as a 
freshman. She’s got to be able to 
see the play and do the play and 
not let her mind get in the way. 
She’ll be all right.”

After all, as a recently named 

Co-Big Ten Freshman of the 
Week, Sobczak remains confident 
in herself.

“I wouldn’t be here unless I 

wanted to compete,” Sobczak 
said. “I committed here knowing 
I wanted to compete for a 
position, and I think more than 
anything, the pressure is why we 
play. If it was easy, no one would 
want to play.”

Third line reunited, 
finally healthy again

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Editor

With a minute gone in the third 

period Friday night, Michigan 
hockey team coach Red Berenson 
threw his third line out at Yost 
Ice Arena.

But this third line was different 

than the one that started the 
game. After trotting out a third 
line of senior Justin Selman and 
freshmen Cooper Marody and 
Brendan Warren, Selman was 
replaced by sophomore Tony 
Calderone, reuniting the third 
line that started off the season.

After leading the team in 

scoring through November with 
14 goals, the line of Marody, 
Calderone and Warren has tailed 
off since then, scoring just five 
goals in the subsequent months.

And in mid-January, when 

Marody 
came 
down 
with 

mononucleosis, the line that was 
so prolific early in the season was 
split up. With Marody out, Selman 
was brought in to center the line.

A month later, just as Marody 

was healthy again, Calderone 
came down with a lower-body 
injury, which, once again, pushed 
back the date for the trio’s return 
to the ice. 

But Friday, the third line that 

started the season was brought 
back together and rekindled its 
scoring spark.

On 
their 
first 
shift 
back 

together, 
Calderone 
retrieved 

the puck in the corner of the 
offensive zone and dished it off 
to Marody, who got tied up and 
lost it. Calderone gathered the 
loose puck, spun around and fired 
at the goal, beating Ohio State 
goaltender Christian Frey to cut 
the Wolverines’ deficit to three.

Later in the period, Marody 

found Calderone open inside the 
left circle and Calderone ripped 
the puck past Frey to cut the 
Buckeyes’ lead to two.

“(Berenson) just kind of put us 

out there, and our first shift (on 
the ice), we scored, and we stuck 
after that,” Calderone said. “We 

kind of just connected after that.”

Sunday, the line got on the 

board late in the second period 
on the power play. Once again, 
Marody found Calderone in the 
slot, and Calderone backhanded 
the puck past Buckeye goaltender 
Matt 
Tomkins. 
Marody 
also 

scored the game-tying tally to 
push the game into overtime.

With the first line of junior 

forwards Tyler Motte and JT 
Compher and freshman forward 
Kyle Connor leading the way 
offensively for Michigan, the 
three 
other 
lines 
are 
often 

forgotten.

But with so much attention 

given to the first Compher-
Connor-Motte line, it creates 
opportunities for the other lines, 
especially the third.

“We’re 
the 
depth 
guys,” 

Calderone 
said. 
“Everyone 

looks at the CCM line and 
saying, ‘We need to shut them 
down.’ But our line can produce 

every night, too, and it gives 
(the team) more depth on any 
given night. The opponent has 
to watch all of our lines.”

On the line, each of the three 

players has a role on the team, 
a trait similar to the CCM line: 
Warren is the grinder, Marody is 
the passer and Calderone is the 
shooter.

“Warren’s good in the corner,” 

Calderone said. “He’s a real good 
working guy. He wins all his 
battles, which is big. Cooper’s an 
unbelievable passer. He sees the 
ice very well. He’s got great hands. 
And then both of those guys try 
to give me the puck to shoot. I’m 
more of the shooter on that line. 
We really complement each other 
very well.”

With the third line back 

together and rolling, evident in its 
four-goal weekend against Ohio 
State, the depth might be exactly 
what Michigan needs to win the 
Big Ten Tournament next week.

ART ON 

THE DIAG:

By Ben Rosenstock
Senior Arts Editor

REDEFINING CREATIVITY ON 

CAMPUS

“I just wanna give people weird-ass things 

that are super fun.”

DELANEY RYAN/Daily


2B — Thursday, March 10, 2016
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

It’s a crisp afternoon in 

October, and I am sitting on a 
bench near the center of campus. 
I watch a small group of students 
huddled in the center, gesturing 
to different areas on the ground 
below them. Every few feet 
across the Diag, there are long, 
wide strips of plastic bubble 
wrap.

Groups 
of 
students 
slow 

down 
and 
step 
deliberately 

on 
the 
bubbles, 
laughing 

ecstatically with every loud 
pop. When somebody shoots 
by on a longboard or a bike, the 
explosion of plastic sounds like 
machine gunfire. What sticks 
out the most to me, though, 
are the solitary students, the 
random guys stepping gingerly 
on the plastic and smiling a little. 
The simple, small reactions.

This is “Bubbled,” the first 

installation of Art on the Diag, 
or D/ART, a new club on campus. 
Like the Do Random Acts of 
Kindness club filtered through 
an artistic lens, the group plans 
elaborate pieces of art using 
interactive materials. So far, the 
group has only planned one piece 
each semester due to the scale 
and ambition of the projects.

The president of D/ART is 

Daniel Sharp (a junior in the 
Ford School of Public Policy) 
with a minor in Art History. 
Sharp first conceived of the club 
as a sophomore, wanting an 
outlet to explore contemporary 
art in visible areas. Transferring 
to the School of Art & Design 
was one option, but most of the 
Stamps artwork is displayed 
in their own building rather 
than on Central Campus, where 
most students live and work. 
Working at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art would 
enable him to facilitate or sell 
artwork, but not actually create 
any. None of the arts student 
groups on campus were focused 
on creating large-scale works in 
public spaces, so Sharp and a few 
other friends decided to make 
their own.

“It would hopefully create 

an outlet for any student, in any 
major, to directly practice and 
hone their skills in large-scale 
art creation and facilitation,” 
Sharp said.

There are between 10 and 15 

dedicated members of the group, 
most of whom joined the group 
at Festifall. Several others joined 
after the October installation.

“Bubbled” 
was 
originally 

Sharp’s 
idea, 
but 
it 
was 

workshopped 
for 
over 
two 

months 
between 
Sharp, 
D/

ART 
Vice 
President 
Sarah 

Rusinowski, 
Treasurer 
Holly 

Sterling and Central Student 
Government. 
After 
changing 

the installation’s specifications 
so it complied with fire codes 
and handicap protections, the 
group spent some time applying 
for grants. Once the materials 
were purchased, though, it was 
just a matter of waiting for 6,000 
square feet of bubble wrap to 
arrive at the door.

“Naturally, it arrived when 

I was in class,” Sharp said. “My 
roommate was a bit surprised 
when 
a 
Uline 
bus 
began 

depositing rolls and rolls and 
rolls of bubble wrap on our front 
lawn.”

Now, D/ART ideas go through 

a very collaborative process 
before they come to life.

“Anyone in D/ART can submit 

an artwork idea,” Sharp said. 
“Then, for one entire day, we 
discuss the possible works for 
next semester, tweak or change 
some designs, materials and 
conceptual concepts, and arrive 
at some amazing ideas.”

Rusinowski, a LSA junior, 

emphasized the low stress of the 
club, partly due to its low time 
commitment.

“We meet semi-regularly to 

discuss upcoming projects, but 
involvement usually depends on 
the 
installation,” 
Rusinowski 

said. “In general, D/ART is a 
super low-stress organization 
because 
it’s 
so 
reliant 
on 

collaboration. We all participate 
because it’s fun.”

Creating large-scale public 

installations 
doesn’t 
come 

without its challenges. According 
to Rusinowski, D/ART has been 
able to count on grants from Arts 
at Michigan, a program within 
the Office of New Student 
Programs, and CSG. In addition 
to planning and holding most D/
ART meetings and organizing 
the building and maintenance 
of 
the 
installations, 
Sharp 

finalizes grant applications and 
deals with the purchases and 
reimbursements of art materials.

“We 
actually 
collaborated 

with 
the 
Rackham 
Student 

Government to apply to the 
Michigan Bicentennial Student 
Grant Initiative for next year,” 
Sharp said, explaining his hopes 
for the future of the club. “If we 
win the grant, D/ART’s funding 
will be secured and expanded 
for next year. So expect quite 
the hubbub and excitement next 
year, if this comes to fruition.”

The installations themselves 

involve 
the 
whole 
team’s 

collaboration on the day they go 
up.

“We 
always 
have 
D/ART 

members present,” Rusinowski 

said. “We have to take care of 
setup and tear-down because 
our installations typically only 
stay up for one day.”

“The day of the installation 

went by in an instant,” Sharp 
said. “Everyone was absolutely 
excited, running on adrenaline 
and amazed at how many people 
— at least eight for me — came up 
and told us how much popping 
bubble 
wrap 
turned 
their 

day around. It was absolutely 
rewarding in the end to see how 
a specific, niche organization 
could still impact a wide range of 
people.”

D/ART has also had to deal 

with the absence of Sharp this 
semester, as he studies abroad 
in Berlin, meaning the group is 
only doing one instead of two 
installations this semester.

However, the “D/ARTboard” 

has a number of members who 
have stepped up to the plate in 
Sharp’s absence, and Rusinowski 
and LSA freshman Anne Tsaloff 
have played a major roles in 
putting 
together 
D/ART’s 

second big installation, “Mirror 
Mimesis,” which will come to 
fruition on March 17. For the 
installation, D/ART will put 
50 reflective cubes on the Diag 
open for anyone to tear down 
into different shapes and sizes. 
Passersby can build the cubes 
into structures or deconstruct 
them in creative ways.

“We 
want 
to 
start 
a 

conversation 
about 
what 

constitutes 
art,” 
Rusinowski 

said. “Just because we put 
bubble wrap on the ground 
and call it art, does that make 
it valid, or is it just garbage? 
Art is always constructed, and 
for so long I didn’t get that. 
There is no real explanation for 
valuing a prestigious symphony 
performance that costs $50 to 
attend over a talented street 
performer. I think starting that 
conversation has been one of 
my favorite things about being 
involved with D/ART.”

As the team started to clean up 

the bubble wrap at the end of the 
first installation, Sharp looked 
out at the Diag and beamed.

“I just wanna give people art,” 

Sharp said. “I just wanna give 
people weird-ass things that are 
super fun.”

As I sat and looked at the joyful 

reactions of random passersby, 
the wild bursts of laughter and 
the tentative grins, I knew that 
D/ART was accomplishing just 
that.

“Chic” and “comfort” are 

two words that describe 
Chloé’s latest collection 
perfectly. The first look to 
grace the runway was a huge 
poncho. I’m not quite sure 
how anyone under 5’8” would 
look in this. For someone 
of my short stature, it may 
appear like I’m drowning, but 
you know what? I don’t care 
because the poncho is flawless.

Not everything was made 

with comfort and flattery 
in mind. Within the first 
minute, a full-on leather zip-
up jumpsuit came down the 
runway. This was slightly 
unflattering on the stick figure 
model, so I try not to picture 
myself in this garment. The 
idea of this piece is great, super 
chic with an edge.

Oversized ponchos and 

capes seemed to be a big theme 
throughout the show, if you 
haven’t caught on already. 
Whether they were worn 
on top of a beautiful chiffon 
dress or paired with cropped 
leather pants, they were 
certainly a dominating factor. 
These capes and ponchos 
were truly inspiring, bringing 
the oversized look into high 
fashion this season. I’m not 
exaggerating when I say 
this: immediately following 
the show, I went to my dad’s 

closet looking for oversized 
sweatshirts. Maybe, just 
maybe, they could somehow 
resemble this look to a fraction 
of a degree. I can try, can’t I? 
Many of the fashion-obsessed, 
such as myself, would truly try 
anything to look Chloé-esque.

Almost every piece, aside 

from the classic leather 
ensembles were oversized 
and feminine. So if you are a 
couple of pounds over your 
“summertime goal weight,” 
it won’t matter in these free-
flowing Chloé pieces. Another 
theme of the show was the 
scarf tied tightly around the 
model’s neck. If you can picture 
the Pink Ladies from “Grease” 
and the scarves they wore on 
their necks, that’s what these 
Chloé scarves resembled. It’s 
no wonder the fashion world 
has been favoring scarves as 
of late. Think about it: you can 
literally wear a scarf like this 
with anything, and your outfit 
will be effectively 10 times 
cooler (don’t believe me? Try 
it). Almost everything in this 
collection was constructed 
from soft colors and loose 
edges, which lent a sense of 
boho-chic. Carefree and cool 
vibes radiated off of each 
garment, perfectly curated for 
this collection.

Surprisingly, no handbags 

came down the runway with 
any of the models. This was 
disappointing; the world has 

never seen a Chloé bag that it 
wasn’t immediately impressed 
with. Most of the shoes in the 
show were boots; most boots 
had a high shaft, above the 
ankle but still below the knee 
for more wearability. They 
came in different colors, such 
as black, brown and tan.

However, the coolest 

piece of all came out nine 
minutes into the show. It was 
a multicolored, oversized coat 
that stopped at the knee. Made 
of a thick wool-like material, 
the coat was completely and 
unapologetically fringed. This 
jacket was by far the biggest 
statement piece of the show 
this season.

To sum it up, I basically 

want everything that came 
down the runway. The 
oversized and free-forming 
designs bring about a pure 
form of femininity, which is 
something I can get behind. 
These high-end fashion 
garments are something that 
you can wear out to a gala, or 
wear inside when you’re alone 
in the apartment eating your 
leftover Chinese food. Now, 
that’s versatility at its finest. 
This collection receives an A 
from me. The designer really 
had every kind of woman in 
mind while creating these 
pieces, and I know I am among 
the many women who hope to 
be lucky enough to wear them 
one day.

FASHION RECAP

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

The early and middle 20th 

century was a period of profound 
darkness. The spasms of war 
wracked the whole of the spin-
ning globe, 
washing 
the world in 
blood as vio-
lence spread 
like a con-
tagion. The 
carnage of 
the Second 
World War 
shattered 
nations 
— human-
ity heard 
“Rolling 
Thunder” in 
the distance 
and saw 
an “Iron 
Curtain” 
descend-
ing. And 
of course, after a fateful August 
morning on Honshu Island, the 
world came to live with the omni-
present menace of Oppenheimer’s 
monster.

While this temperament is 

present in visual arts, dance, 
music, poetry, literature and other 
areas, it is perhaps most noticeable 
in theatre. Starting around World 
War II, existentialism and absurd-
ism began to surface in dramatic 
art. In France, Sartre’s “Huis Clos” 
explored a personalized existen-
tialist Hell of people and Albert 
Camus’s “Le Malentendu” probed 
the depths of the absurd. The 
Irishman Samuel Beckett incorpo-
rated both Sartre’s existentialism 
and Camus’s absurdist outlook 
into his masterpiece “Waiting for 
Godot.” But in English language 
arts, the culmination of absurdist 
theatre is possibly Tom Stoppard’s 
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern 
Are Dead,” a tragicomedy first 
staged in 1966 in Edinburgh that is 
coming to the Arthur Miller stage 
in Ann Arbor this weekend.

“Because it’s absurdist theatre 

at its heart it doesn’t have the arc 
to it that people often expect from 
theatre. And the characters by the 
end aren’t necessarily changed 
by it — Rosencrantz and Guilden-
stern never escape their fate,” said 
David Widmayer, the director of 
Ann Arbor Civic Theatre’s pro-
duction of the play, in an interview 
with the Michigan Daily.

Widmayer started acting in 

eighth grade, and continued 
throughout high school. As a stu-

dent at the University of Michigan 
— though not a theatre major — he 
joined the improv group Witt’s 
End in its inaugural year. Fol-
lowing his time at the University, 
Widmayer auditioned for a role in 
“The Tempest” at the Ann Arbor 
Civic Theatre, where he has been 
working ever since. “Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern” will mark Wid-
mayer’s directorial debut at the 
Civic Theatre.

“I’ve always loved it. I first saw 

scenes from it in high school,” 
Widmayer said of his decision to 
stage Stoppard’s work. “It’s very 
much about sort of discovering 
the play.”

The title of “Rosencrantz and 

Guildenstern Are Dead” is taken 
from a line in the final scene of 
Shakespeare’s famous tragedy 
“Hamlet,” and the action of Stop-
pard’s play mostly occurs on the 
sidelines of Shakespeare’s, with 
the title characters largely isolated 
from the events of the elder trag-
edy. Woven throughout the play, 
however, are scenes and lines from 
“Hamlet,” interspersed between 
the philosophical contemplations 
of the two title characters.

“[Rosencrantz and Guilden-

stern] move inexorably from the 
start of the play to the end where 
they die, constantly sort of futilely 
fighting against the idea that they 
can’t do anything about their fate,” 
Widmayer said. “It shares a lot in 
common with ‘Waiting for Godot’ 
… because it’s not about the plot, 
it’s about what the characters are 
going through and their internal 
struggle and the way that Stop-
pard uses that to make us think 
about death or destiny or prede-
termination.”

Widmayer and his colleagues 

have approached much of the set 
design for the play with a mini-
malist, abstract perspective which 
lends itself to the somewhat intan-
gible nature of the play’s setting.

“We brought in a minimal 

amount of set pieces,” Widmayer 
said. “Mostly what will occupy 
the thrust stage are very simple 
rehearsal style blocks, which can 
represent tables or chairs, and sort 
of fit the character of Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstern being in a loca-
tion of no particular character.”

The Civic Theatre’s production 

will also use updated costuming, 
eschewing traditional Shakespear-
ean garb for 20th century fashion.

“I’ve got a really great costum-

er, Anni Fox, who has sort of taken 
us in a little bit of a modern direc-
tion,” Widmayer said. “We were 
originally thinking we would go 
with a more Elizabethan feel for 

it … but as she started to develop 
it she pitched to me a little more 
modern feel, with some designs 
inspired by current designers 
making fashion for runways, high 
fashion stuff with deconstructed 
suits and things like that.”

A large portion of the play 

features a group of tragedians — 
ostensibly the same who feature 
in Act III of “Hamlet” — and this 
presented an opportunity for a 
great deal of original music and 
musicians in the cast.

“We wrote all original songs for 

it as a group … singers would go 
off and look at Stoppard’s text and 
also the text from “Hamlet and 
pick out phrases that they liked for 
the lyrics, and the instrumental-
ists would work together on laying 
out a basic instrumental part,” 
Widmayer said. “Then we’d bring 
everyone back together and jam 
it out until we [had our songs] … it 
has sort a modern American folk 
music feel to it, but each song has 
its own character.”

Widmayer and the cast also use 

the music to provide commentary 
on the play, exploring many of the 
questions raised within the script.

“[Listening to the lyrics, one 

will] notice that they either have 
just heard some of the things that 
they’re singing or they’ll find that 
just afterwards the lyrics appear 
in the text … so the songs either 
seem to be echoing something 
that’s just happened or predicting 
something that’s about to hap-
pen.,” Widmayer said. “That’s a 
feel I really enjoy with it, because 
it plays up some of the metathe-
atrical issues that we’re dealing 
with in the show where there’s a 
lot of playing with place and play-
ing with time and playing with 
the idea of ‘has all this happened 
before?’”

By the end of the play, con-

cepts ranging from the differ-
ences between art and reality 
to the extent of an individual’s 
significance are explored, leaving 
audience members with plenty of 
material to ponder.

“There isn’t necessarily an 

answer to the questions raised 
by it — or at least we don’t have 
one answer in mind that we 
want them to come away with,” 
Widmayer said. “What we want 
them to come away with is having 
asked interesting questions, hav-
ing made them think about things 
in a different way, particularly 
about what the value of knowledge 
is — if you had perfect knowledge 
about how everything was going 
to turn out, would that make you 
happier or not?”

‘Dead’ performance

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

By ARIANA ASSAF

Daily Arts Writer

“We had playdates. It was tight,” 

Aseem Mangaokar said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily 
of his early days with childhood 
friend turned musical collabora-
tor Chris Gavino. Now producing 
together as DJ duo Hotel Garuda, 
you could say their playdate activi-
ties have progressed beyond swing 
sets and sandboxes to a playground 
of nightclub stages and music fes-
tivals.

Though 
living 
on 
opposite 

coasts — in L.A. and D.C., respec-
tively — Mangaokar and Gavino 
began working together in Janu-
ary 2014. Since then, they’ve made 
a name for themselves putting 
out a variety of remixes — of Lana 
Del Rey’s “Summertime Sadness,” 
Chromeo’s “Jealous” and Galantis’ 
“Gold Dust” to name a few — and 
already have a set at EDC Vegas 
under their belts (real talk, I didn’t 
know that until after our interview, 
which is probably good consider-
ing EDC is practically Mecca and I 
don’t know how to process having 
talked to someone who’s reached 
it). Hotel Garuda’s relatively rapid 
rise has most recently landed 
them on their first-ever tour with 
Amtrac, who released his Lost in 
Motion EP about a month ago. A 
six-week engagement, the Lost in 
Motion tour made a stop at Popu-
lux last Friday, drawing crowds 
from the local Detroit area and 
as far as East Lansing — plus Ann 
Arbor …*waves*.

Last summer, Gavino temporar-

ily left D.C. to work on music with 
Mangaokar in L.A., and together 

they’ve set off on a journey away 
from remixes and into the world 
of their own original music. Hotel 
Garuda’s first single began to take 
shape in September, after Gavino 
was already back at school in D.C. 
Working remotely, they completed 
the track by January, but as of now 
it’s still tantalizingly mysterious to 
most of the world.

“There’s a method to the mad-

ness,” Mangaokar said of his agen-
cy’s marketing strategy behind 
new releases. “Now that we’re 
involved with a label, there’s a lot 
more that goes into it than us just 
making a song and putting it up.” 
Luckily, that means tons of sup-
port and industry resources for 
their work which — combined 
with undeniable talent, seems to 
be a recipe for success. The single 
is set to be officially released on a as 
of yet undisclosed date in the near 
future, and I can only imagine it 
will benefit from the hype coming 
off the tour.

Of course, it will also benefit 

from the fact that it’s a total jam. 
That’s right, the Populux crowd 
was treated to an early listen of the 
very first Hotel Garuda original, 
and I must say my ears felt honored. 
Imagine an echo-y, liquid tune that 
quickly opens up to Emily Warren-
esque vocals held together by an 
overall dance vibe that perfectly 
leaves listeners wanting more, and 
you’ll have a sense of the song that 
will (hopefully) hold you over until 
it you can listen for yourself.

Before Hotel Garuda, local duo 

Golf Clap warmed up the room 
with their deep house stylings. 
Apparently I’m totally out of the 
loop because they play at Can-

tina with some regularity and I’m 
embarrassed to say I’ve never been. 
They’ve got plenty of upcoming 
shows scheduled around here—I’m 
particularly excited for the Hash 
Bash Official Afterparty at The 
Blind Pig (who wouldn’t be?). Any-
way, the room continued to fill as 
Hotel Garuda took the stage, and I 
can only imagine that from an art-
ist’s point of view watching people 
flock to your music is as promising 
as watching the sun rise. The set 
that followed was as refreshing as a 
Sunday morning, and as energetic 
as a Friday night in your twenties 
should be.

Characterized by quick transi-

tions and plenty of opportunities 
to sing along, Hotel Garuda estab-
lished a steady flow of house beats 
mixed with fun samples (not the 
kind from pop songs that the radio 
beats to death), creating an envi-
ronment that buzzed like a great 
college house party, but with bet-
ter music and LED lights. Amtrac 
finished off the night, working the 
crowd into a frenzy by letting his 
build-ups simmer until they were 
good and ready to explode; it really 
did have something of a detonative 
quality, like a glitter bomb of music 
raining down over a happy crowd. 

Perhaps one of the most won-

derful things that comes from talk-
ing to an artist about their work is 
the chance to get a sense of their 
passion behind it. Sure, watching 
a DJ rock out in the booth is great, 
but listening to them geek out over 
their own music and that of their 
friends is pretty cool, too. Though 
still in the early stages of his career, 
Mangaokar seems committed to 
keep the good times coming.

SINGLE REVIEW

 Tyler, the Creator and A$AP 
Rocky bring the public much 
needed material after having 
spent what felt 
like weeks in the 
studio together. 
With “What 
The Fuck Right 
Now,” they 
bring a musical 
chaos and 
frenzy that fans 
of Tyler have 
been missing 
for some time 
now (with the 
accompanied 
video of Tyler 
and A$AP wilding out in the 
studio being icing on the cake).

 The track’s title and beat are 
both borrowed from Kanye 
West’s “Freestyle 4” — fitting 
considering the release comes 
on the heels of Tyler’s various 
creative collaborations with 
West. While the track itself 
was a nice addition to The Life 
of Pablo, providing listeners a 
candid illustration of Kanye’s 
menacingly confident psyche, it 
also felt a bit bare relative to an 
otherwise frenetic collection of 
songs. In typical Tyler fashion, 
he reworks the beat with surreal 
and raucous lyrics — “I hope 
you dressin’ yourself and not 
followin’ niggas opinions on 
fashion, I hope them cars you 
drivin’ ain’t rented just to get 

some comments on ‘Gram.” 
Elsewhere, you can find A$AP’s 
ever present bombastic persona, 
serving as a hypeman for Tyler 
and the track.
 A$AP Rocky and Tyler’s 
newfound relationship definitely 
seems to have rubbed off on 
Tyler in a positive way. After 
recently publicly announcing 
his ambivalence toward hip-hop 
and his rap career, his release 
of “What The Fuck Right Now” 
denotes a positive musical 
direction for the artist. Hopefully 
this rejuvenation carries enough 
momentum for Tyler to create 
even more material worth of his 
potential.

Shows of our youth 
more substantial 
than you think

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Senior Arts Editor

The years of 2003 to 2007 were 

great for science fiction on TV. No, 
I’m not talking about the premiere 
of “Lost” or “Battlestar Galactica.” 
I’m not referring to the relaunch of 
“Doctor Who,” or the one-season 
wonder “Invasion.” No. I’m talk-
ing about “Phil of the Future” and 
“That’s So Raven,” two of the best 
TV shows Disney Channel ever 
created.

Okay, yeah, maybe we all like 

to romanticize the shows we were 
irrationally obsessed with when 
we were kids. But I recently went 
back and re-watched a couple epi-
sodes of “Phil of the Future,” and 
they hold up! Aside from the ridic-
ulous overabundance of sound 
effects that characterized Disney 
shows of the time, the show is fun, 
thoughtful, funny and surprisingly 
emotional.

People tend to dismiss stories 

targeted at children once they get 
older. When I bring up “Phil of 
the Future” in casual conversa-
tion, people laugh, because they 
remember it as a show they kind 
of liked back in elementary school, 
but not one that still holds any sig-
nificance to them. I get the same 
reaction when I tell people that 
last year, I read the entirety of the 
“Animorphs” series, most known 
now for its iconic covers of tweens 
morphing into animals.

Just because something is writ-

ten for kids, though, doesn’t mean 
the writers don’t put real thought 
and care into it. I mean, sure, there 
are some kids’ shows that only do 
the bare minimum to keep kids 
watching with simplistic morality 
lessons and ugly, uninventive ani-
mation. But for every shitty show 
like “Caillou,” there’s something 
thoughtful out there. After all, 
it’s not like these shows are being 
written by kids. They’re written by 
adults with kids in mind, and many 
of them have a lot to offer to adults, 
too. I mean, have you seen “Adven-
ture Time?” It’s imaginative, funny 
and dark when you least expect it.

Last year, I touted “Inside Out” 

as the best science fiction film of 
2015, because it uses its fantasti-
cal concepts to establish essential 
truths about human nature while 

providing a rich world of cool sci-
fi details to take in. “Phil of the 
Future” does the same thing. When 
you sit down and take it seriously 
instead of seeing it as some juve-
nile program from back when our 
brains weren’t developed enough 
to know when TV was good or bad, 
you can see that many of these Dis-
ney Channel shows pull off science 
fiction better than most of the sci-fi 
shows that make it to air now.

There’s a tendency now for sci-

ence fiction to get bogged down in 
a mass of undecipherable mythol-
ogy, even in the best shows. “Lost” 
became notoriously convoluted 
because of the number of questions 
it raised, and “The X-Files” did 
the same, even this year during its 
return. “Orphan Black” is almost 
always better when it backs off 
the complicated conspiracy theo-
ries and luxuriates in the inherent 
coolness of its premise: a bunch of 
clones played by the same (amaz-
ing) actor.

“Phil of the Future” is never 

convoluted, 
and 
sure, 
maybe 

that’s because it’s made for kids, 
but so what? Maybe if the writ-
ers of “Lost” had kept a possible 
adolescent audience in mind, its 
reputation wouldn’t have taken a 
nosedive in the eyes of half its fan 
base.

The first episode of “Phil of 

the Future” I re-watched was 
“Unification Day,” in which Phil 
Diffy (Ricky Ullman, who briefly 
returned to acting for a cameo in 
“Broad City” last season) and his 
family celebrate the day when the 
Earth will, in the future, achieve 
world peace. Phil and his dad 
(Craig Anton, “MADtv”) have 
a tradition of playing a game of 
“laser squash” each Unification 
Day, but this year Phil blows him 
off to go to a party with his friends, 
including 
Keely 
Teslow 
(Aly 

Michalka, “Easy A”). Eventually, 
Phil inevitably decides to ditch the 
party and play some laser squash 
with his dad, and I swear, guys, 
I almost teared up seeing Lloyd 
Diffy smile with pride and relief at 
his son coming back home. Watch-
ing your kids grow up is hard, even 
in the future.

In any normal sitcom, this 

would be a Christmas episode, or 
a Thanksgiving episode. “Phil of 
the Future,” though, manages to 
hit the traditional emotional beats 
of a holiday episode while filter-
ing it through a sci-fi lens. There’s 
something fun and unusual about 
seeing a kid and his dad playing 

laser squash where a regular sit-
com would just use basketball. 
And there are these little giddy 
moments of world-building that 
sci-fi fans crave, like the future 
sport of laser squash, or the spray 
cans of meatloaf that Pim (Amy 
Bruckner, “Rebound”) uses, or 
the strange finger-wiggling ges-
ture Phil and his family casually 
make to somehow indicate their 
appreciation of Unification Day. 
But for the most part, “Phil of the 
Future” is content to use these sci-
fi elements as little cool touches 
to enhance the fun of an episode 
that’s otherwise concerned with 
the same reliable themes of grow-
ing up and parenthood that other 
family sitcoms use.

You can also find this with 

“Wizards of Waverly Place,” or “So 
Weird,” or any other Disney Chan-
nel show with paranormal or fan-
tastical elements. Every episode of 
“That’s So Raven” involves Raven 
(Raven-Symoné, “The View”) get-
ting a glimpse into the future and 
using that information to solve 
some human crisis — urging her 
best friend to break up with the 
boyfriend Raven sees cheating on 
her, for example, or trying to save 
her dad’s job after a vision of him 
getting fired. And the writers are 
still able to imbue these human 
stories with cool world-building 
flourishes. One of the most mem-
orable episodes, for example, is 
“Clothes Minded,” which involves 
Raven getting a vision of the school 
bullies putting a wheel of smelly 
cheese in the hot air vent. Raven 
approaches the group and says, 
“Uh, you guys weren’t planning 
on putting the cheese in the vent, 
were you?” They reply, “Well, we 
weren’t … until you just said that.” 
It doubles as a great joke and a clas-
sic example of the self-fulfilling 
prophecy concept that crops up in 
practically every time travel plot.

Look, I’m not saying people 

should drop whatever they’re 
watching and regress to the TV 
they loved when they were tod-
dlers. We should read widely and 
watch widely. But part of that 
means making a space for sto-
ries traditionally designated “for 
kids.” If you’re an artist, what you 
consume when you’re little can be 
enormously influential in what you 
create as an adult, but you don’t 
have to be a child to form those 
connections. Just because you 
watched it as a kid doesn’t mean 
it can’t offer you anything as an 
adult.

EPISODE REVIEW

Due to its 30-minute run-

time and its 10-episode sea-
sons, “Girls” is a show that 
frequently struggles to give 
each of its many main char-
acters their 
own complete 
story arcs. 
The first 
two episodes 
of this sea-
son were 
so strong 
because they 
had a sense 
of focus and 
efficiency; 
while the 
premiere confined all the 
characters to one convenient 
location, the second episode 
dropped Shoshanna (Zosia 
Mamet, “Mad Men”) and 
Marnie (Allison Williams, 
“Peter Pan Live!”) entirely to 
focus on the other characters.

This week’s episode, 

“Japan,” might’ve worked 
better if it had focused on 

Shosh for the entirety of the 
episode. The change of setting 
works great for “Girls,” and 
it’s fascinating to see Shosh 
flourishing in an entirely new 
environment, making friends 
with a pair of Japanese girls 
and crushing on her boss, 
Yoshi (Hiro Mizushima, 
“Black Butler”). Even more 
pleasantly surprising, Shosh 
makes the choice to stay in 
Japan, going against “Girls” 
’s tendency to reset the sta-
tus quo every time there’s a 
change of scenery (see: Han-
nah’s brief stay in Iowa last 
season). If we’re lucky this 
time, we’re in for some more 
episodes set in Japan.

Instead of confining the 

whole episode to Japan, there 
are two subplots crammed 
in. Adam (Adam Driver, “Star 
Wars: The Force Awakens”) 
and Jessa (Jemima Kirke, 
“Tiny Furniture”) are devel-
oping some really nice chem-
istry, so the lack of progress in 

their budding romance is for-
givable. The subplot involv-
ing Hannah (Lena Dunham, 
“Happy Christmas”) discover-
ing naked pictures of Fran’s 
(Jake Lacy, “Carol”) exes is 
less substantial, though it still 
leads to some great moments 
of comedy as Hannah makes 
Ray (Alex Karpovsky, “Inside 
Llewyn Davis”) and Elijah 
(Andrew Rannells, “The New 
Normal”) take nude pictures 
of her. There’s also the Skype 
call between Hannah and 
Marnie, whose pronunciation 
of ‘Ecuador’ is such a brilliant 
and hilarious encapsulation of 
her character.

Despite lacking the focus of 

the first two episodes, “Japan” 
tells an unusually effective 
Shoshanna story and provides 
plenty of comedy to go along 
with it. And, if nothing else, 
you can replay the clip of 
Marnie saying “Ecuador” a 
hundred times like I did.

‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ 

100th Episode 

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind do the same activity 

and write about their experiences.

this week’s event:

I. love. this. fucking show. I have given my metaphorical blood sweat and tears to every season 

of this show (except 1 and 3, sorry bout it), and i am 110% excited for season 8. you all have no idea what 
this show means to me.

II. 
Here is my ranking of the best entraces: Naomi Smalls kicking off, mmm girl, serving fish to the 

maxxx. Dax exclamation point: sickening. Acid Betty in and out of drag, absolutely terrifying. 

Robbie Turner giving me a mix of Violet Chachki and Jinx Monsoon and I don’t hate it. 

Kim Chi: 1000% fab. Bob the Drag Queen, I know i will love you this season already. 

Laila mcqueen: You’re actually pretty hot out of drag. Not Pearl hot mind 

you, but there’s something for this straight gal. Derick, are you fucking 

Courtenay Act??? I had to make sure it wasn’t the same person.

Honestly, RuPaul comes into the workroom and I am l 

i v i n g. But mostly because I can’t figure out what 

the fuck is going on with this outfit. circus 

pimp realness perhaps.

So the first challenge starts 

and it’s a photoshoot with all 

the previous winners! Yay! But what 

happened to Sharon Needles?? And where is 

Bianca??? My fave queen is nowhere to be found 

:(.

so the main challenge begins and its a shit show. nobody 

knows what they’re doing per usual, we figure out which queens 

cannot sew (if you’ve been watching this show and want to be on it, 

you know that you won’t last 5 episodes if you can’t sew). One of them gets 

the dog challenge where they dress like a poodle then walk said poodle down the 

runway with you. This challenge sounds amazing, but i would be disqualified for not 

making my look and just petting the dog.

The results are in: Kim Chi wins! Yay! Layla something loses. Sad. But to be honest she was the 

most boring one in my opinion, and now that she’s gone everyone is exciting and I can keep them apart 

in my head. that was fun. time to sleep

Neon sign that says werk!!! Need in my home bc lauren 

conraad wrote a blog post once about how crucial neon 
signs are to decorate your home with bless her paper 
crown for kohl’s heart tbh. Four scorn and two weeks ago I 
procrastinated my Shakespeare essay and had the revelation 
that he literally invented the drag queen, so thanks be to you 
RuPaul for honoring that guy who probably doesn’t need any 
more praise. I’ve never watched this show, and here I am 
watching the 100th episode. Drag “race”? What’s the race? 
Where are they going? What’s the prize? Oh my god someone 
just said, “Go back to party city where you belong” … that 
is an iconic insult that I will definitely use tomorrow on an 
innocent victim. Drag names are iconic. I want a drag name. 
Oh my god this first contestant got his drag name from Naomi 
Campbell. When will I get mine? When will you get yours? 
You won’t, because you belong at Party City and I belong with 
kate middletons parents and their party goodie bag company. 
OK this first guy is so objectively attractive as both a man and 
a woman good for him because I cant even master my #lewk. 
He’s obsessed with ‘90s supermodels! So am i! Everyone 
loves Naomi ugh no one walks like Naomi ugh. HAHA Dax 
ExclamationPoint rn: “what’s up nerds!!!” Dax also wants 
brunch. Dax I will brunch with you. And this entire cast for 
that matter. OMF Acid Betty just made an entrance af. Robbie 
Turner is literally wearing the robe you would wear to answer

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

The video for Halsey’s 

newest single “Colors” is 
devoid of 
just that. A 
platinum 
blonde 
Halsey is 
painted in 
a white-
washed, 
upper-middle class suburbia 
— she’s dating the son (Tyler 
Posey, “Teen Wolf”) of the 
man her mother is dating. 
Her wig is only halfway 
convincing; everyone is oddly 
great at tennis; and there are 
loads of polaroids — you get 
the picture.

The video is almost 

entirely candid as the song 
just plays over videos of the 
characters. The mom seems a 
tad desperate, Halsey is aloof 
toward her boy-hunk and 
Dad’s mustache screams that 
he’s up to no good. The first 
chorus ogles Tyler Posey in 
a way that’s not unenjoyable: 
he jogs, smiles, changes in 
a steamy locker room (with 
his dad?). You know, typical 
pretty-boy shit. Meanwhile, 
Halsey is snapping pics 
through door cracks and 
rolling around some white 
sheets between flirty glances.

Finally, the third-act twist 

comes when she drops a 
handful of polaroids in front 

of her boyfriend, only for him 
to see they’re all of his father. 
The twisted would’ve had 
more success had the video 
played up the mysterious 
romance more, instead it only 
lead in with the odd, healthy 
suspicion uber rich white 
families most of us have.

The seemingly out-of-

context video is supported 
by a fantastic song, without 
a doubt. And while the

If MaxMara is known for one 

thing, it’s his signature camel coat. 
As anticipated, the designer’s 
timeless item once again graced 
the Milan runways; this time, 
however, it came adorned and 
paired 
with 
unprecedented 

gilded upgrades. A change so 
dramatic, the revamped camel 
coat signaled the arrival — as 
put by W Magazine — of a “new 
MaxMara woman.”

The notion of new permeated 

the entire collection. The brand 
dubbed the collection “a wave of 
modern and progressive energy,” 
boasting a fabulous array of 
vibrant fabrics, contrasting colors 
and reinvented silhouettes. Mara 
dressed the ‘working woman’ as a 
bold go-getter, unapologetically 
decked out in lime green and 
turquoise. 
But 
what 
makes 

this season’s collection most 
fascinating, and what brings the 
oddly colored clothes to life, was 
the story behind the collection. 
Mara was not merely playing 
with color blocking, but rather 
curating a decadent fusion of 
history and fashion; modern 
energy fueled, ironically, by the 
past.

The notion of a new MaxMara 

woman is a nod to the designer’s 
unlikely muse for this season’s 
collection: the New Woman 
of Weimar Germany. Mara’s 

pieces 
embodied 
the 
free-

spirited feminism that defined 
the Weimar Republic, while also 
incorporating fixtures inspired 
by the era’s art movements. Set 
amongst a reimagined Berlin 
cabaret, MaxMara’s Fall 2016 
ready-to-wear collection revived 
the Weimar period’s cultural 
achievements in an ode to both 
Europe’s past and today’s present 
(leaving me wondering if the 
designer is secretly a student in 
my History class).

A 
time 
period 
whose 

cultural significance is easily 
overshadowed by its stereotype 
as a dismal age for the defeated 
country, the Weimar Era was 
much more than debt and inflation 
and anger; it was an age of both 
political and culture revolution. 
Weimar 
Germany 
birthed 
a 

variety of cultural changes, from 
the sexual revolution to the 
Dada movement, the Bauhaus 
to the New Woman. A symbol 
of Weimar modernity, the New 
Woman represented feminism 
and individuality during the time 
period. The New Woman was 
fabulous, and feared not when it 
came to exploring who she was 
and asserting her individuality. 
Mara encouraged his customers 
to do the same. The designer 
recreated the traditional pantsuit 
Weimar woman typically sported 
with girlish touches and feminine 
necklines. Vogue UK describes 
the collection as “clothes for the 

confident modern woman.”

Mara’s collection was also 

heavily influenced by Dadaism, 
a satirical, existentialist art form 
that came to fruition during 
the Weimar era. Dada declared 
art was dead and rejected the 
typical social order in an effort to 
create a new set of values. Mara’s 
collection reflected the basic 
principles of Dadaism in that he 
reinvented traditional silhouettes 
to forge a new order for fashion. 
Each individual look evoked the 
spirit of Dada; reimagined coats 
and pantsuits, dress and sequined 
rompers. Mara attempted to 
shatter the image of a typical work 
suit, delivering the traditional 
ensemble in lime green, bright 
yellow 
and 
soft 
pink. 
The 

designer brings versatility and 
color to a season so often tainted 
by nature’s darker colors. Elegant 
blue leather gloves are matched 
with ruby red shoes and a punchy 
orange coat; aquamarine gloves 
accompany a baby pink pantsuit, 
decorated with a random array of 
black and white stripes.

Mara’s 
use 
of 
color 
and 

reworked silhouettes evoked the 
Weimar spirit to defy fashion 
norms and create a new way of 
dressing, a new order which, in 
the words of the brand itself, 
“breaks all the rules.” It was a 
solid effort, but the designer 
could have used more than mere 
colors and shapes to make his 
point.

FASHION RECAP
MaxMara brings a 
modern twist to past

It was Friday afternoon, the 

last day of spring break. Naturally, 
it was the best weather we’d 
had all week in Destin, FL, with 
the 
wind 

brought 
down to a 
whisper 
and 
the 
sun 

scorching 
our 
pasty 

skin. 
Maybe not 
scorching 
— it was 
only about 
60 degrees, still cold enough for 
cover-ups over swimsuits — but 
it felt like summer compared to 
Ann Arbor.

I came to Florida with the 

University 
Triathlon 
Club, 

tagging along on their annual 
spring break training trip. Though 
the majority of our days were 
filled with biking and running, 
some swimming was inevitable 
in the three-leg sport, with the 
help of full-body wetsuits. The 
swimmers in our crew zipped up 
as the rest of us sat on the beach. 
We watched as they ran into the 
flat ocean, stroking in sync, their 
bodies perfectly parallel to the 
shore.

Near the water’s edge, a burly 

man with leathery skin and a 
bucket hat was staking fishing 
poles into the sand. He lumbered 
over to our towels and introduced 
himself, asked about our vacation; 
he grinned like a guy who spends 
his days with a tackle box and a 
cooler of beer.

“I want that life,” said someone 

beside me.

The fisherman had wandered 

back 
down 
shore 
and 
was 

chatting with his fishing buddies, 
tan men with wrinkly smiles. We 
unanimously agreed: we wanted 
what that guy had.

Turns out the happy beach 

dweller we met isn’t an anomaly 
in Florida. Last month, both 
Naples, FL, and the community of 
North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, 
FL, were respectively ranked the 
first and third happiest cities in 
the U.S., according to the Gallup-
Healthways Well-Being Index.

To compile the list, researchers 

collected self-reported data from 
members of 190 U.S. communities, 
asking participants to evaluate 
their health, social relationships, 
community strength, financial 
security and sense of purpose. 
The 
happiest 
communities 

reported were those with less 
reported stress, little depression, 

healthier diets and more frequent 
exercise.

They also had more fun. “Many 

(residents of Naples, FL) like 
their daily activities and enjoy 
an intellectually lively culture, 
telling interviewers they learn or 
do something interesting every 
day,” TODAY reported. Tucked 
in the Everglades on the state’s 
southwestern coast, Naples offers 
something for everybody, from 
world-class hotels to swamp 
tours, sprawling mansions to fish 
shacks. And when tourists leave, 
two mainstays linger: retirees 
and the rich.

On the surface, happiness 

seems 
to 
have 
an 
obvious 

correlation 
with 
wealth 
and 

leisure time. The two aren’t 
exclusively 
related, 
however. 

For example, take a CEO in 
Bellingham, WA, the city with the 
highest levels of stress in the list, 
with 53 percent of adults reporting 
overwhelming daily stress. The 
CEO may have a large paycheck 
to spend on fun activities (which 
would significantly decrease her 
stress), but she has no time to take 
a vacation from work.

Similarly, an unemployed man 

from Charleston, WV, which 
ranked dead last on the Well-
Being Index, may have free time 
in his day, but he is crippled 
with fear of not having food 
on the table (about a quarter of 
the population reported they 
couldn’t 
afford 
groceries 
or 

medical expenses, TODAY said). 
It makes sense, then, that the 
affluent, predominantly retired 
community of Naples is the 
happiest: they have plenty of 
money to spend, and endless time 
to do it. 

But 
something’s 
missing 

here. On the beach, we didn’t 
necessarily envy the Floridian’s 
yacht or wish our days could 
be spent fishing like his. What 
struck me the most about him 
— why I wanted that life — had 
nothing to do with money, leisure 
time, or even the beach itself, but 
everything to do with the wrinkly 
friends the man was laughing 
with.

In the rankings, Naples wasn’t 

the richest, healthiest or most 
purposeful city, but it scored first 
in perhaps the most important 
(and often overlooked) category: 
community well-being. People 
weren’t happier just because 
they could shop or spend their 
days fishing; they were happiest 
because they had others to share 
their experiences with. Being 
an active part of a community — 

whether it’s a weekend golf crew, 
book club or church congregation 
— seems to boost our health and 
happiness more than anything 
else.

When we’re not connected, 

our happiness — and health in 
general — can spiral downward 
quickly. As an article in the 
Guardian about the secrets of 
happy cities said, “As much as 
we complain about other people, 
there is nothing worse for mental 
health than a social desert. The 
more connected we are to family 
and community, the less likely we 
are to experience heart attacks, 
strokes, cancer and depression. 
Connected people sleep better 
at 
night. 
They 
live 
longer. 

They consistently report being 
happier.”

Stanford University’s wellness 

report also addressed community 
influence, saying “The problem: 
we often do not recognize the 
importance of social connection. 
Our culture values hard work, 
success, and wealth, so it’s no 
surprise some of us do not set 
aside enough time for social ties 
when we think security lies in 
material things rather than other 
people.”

For college students, these 

findings are incredibly important. 
As we dip our toes into adulthood, 
we start to realize how big the 
world is — how many cities we 
can live in, careers we can pursue, 
degrees we can accept, fitness 
goals we can achieve — and it’s 
easy to lose our social lives in the 
thick of it.

We’ll get back to our friends 

and family, we think, after the 
MCAT exam. And the marathon. 
And graduation. Because when 
the 
“important” 
things 
are 

accomplished, we’re convinced 
we’ll be happier. And we’re 
wrong.

We 
didn’t 
want 
to 
leave 

Florida on Saturday morning. Not 
because of the sun or the sand, the 
sports bra runs and 100-mile bike 
rides on snow-free roads, or even 
the poolside pina coladas. We’d 
miss them all in Ann Arbor, no 
doubt, but what we’d miss most is 
our connection with each other: 
22 people in a house, crowded and 
cramped, happily sharing every 
experience.

Let’s do that more often.
