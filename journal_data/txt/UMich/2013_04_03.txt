The realities of incidents
like the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil
spill were portrayed on a much
smaller scale on the Diag mid-

In front of prospective stu-

walking to class, four students
donned yellow HAZMAT
suits and scrubbed oil off of
inflatable sea creatures and
held signs that read, "Oil Hits

forUM to defend
Osborne, Sakwa in
CSG legal battles
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Judi-
ciary will be hearing appeals
this weekend as Central Student
Government parties youMICH
and forUM remain locked in a
legal battle for both the presi-
dency and control of the assem-
hly.
The University Elections
Commission will be defending
its rulings before CSJ in a hear-
ing against forUM Saturday
morning and a hearing against
youMICH Sunday morning.
forUM appealed the UEC's
decision to disqualify LSA junior
Chris Osborn, the presidential
candidate of forUM, and his
running mate, LSA junior Hay-
ley Sakwa, for influencing voters
while voting.
youMICH appealed the UEC's
ruling to award no demerits to

forUM for charges it abused an
e-mail listserv. While the UEC
ruled that there wasn't enough
evidence, youMICH is presum-
ably attempting to bring the
total demerits against forUM -
which already has eight - to 10
or more, which would disqualify
the party that won a majority of
seats on the assembly.
As a party, forUM was award-
ed eight demerits after the UEC
found forUM guilty of violat-
ing donations limits to a party.
According to the election code,
students are to donate only $150
to a party, hut both Osborn and
Sakwa gave $300 to the party.
During the UEC hearing,
forUM counsel argued that the
money was given to the party as
part of its dues before the rule
took effect.
The UEC, however, found that
campaign finances are subject
to accrual accounting, meaning
that the timeframe of a dona-
tion is less important for what
purpose it was used. forUM was
awarded four demerits for both
Osborn's and Sakwa's dona-

Diag in honor of Earth Week.
The mock oil spill was
designed to show the "dirty and
dangerous" side of oil depen-
dence and garner support for a
future with more environmen-
tally-friendly fuels.
In front of the oil spill, the
group set up a mini wind farm.
Probably unplanned, wind
power also blew pamphlets and
posters off tables and the oil
spill loose from its position.
Beth Wallace of the National

Wildlife Federation and Vir-
ginia Shannon from Environ-
ment Michigan spoke at the
event.
Wallace discussed the
Obama administration's deci-
sion last year to approve
drilling in the Arctic Ocean.
She said off-shore drilling is
"extremely risky" referring to
recent major oil disasters, such
as the Gulf of Mexico Spill and
the Embridge Energy pipeline

SCIENCE
Research to
better plastics
manufacturing

'U' researchers
study effects of
copper and light
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
You're likely touching some-
thing right now that had its
roots in propylene oxide.
The compound is used to
produce plastics, and thanks to
University researchers, its pro-
duction may be revolutionized.
A paper published in the
March 29 issue of Science Maga-
zine reveals that the addition of
copper and intense light - near-
ly 140 times more intense than
an average sunny day - pro-
vides a more environmentally
friendly way to bond propylene
and oxygen.
Suljo Linic, an Engineering
associate professor, who led the
research, said the substance
that could catalyze propylene
oxide would be the "holy grail"
of the chemical engineering dis-
cipline because the highly ver-

satile compound has an intricate
synthesis. Engineering graduate
student Andiappan Marimuthu
and University alum Jianwen
Zhang also authored the article.
"It's a gateway chemical, and,
ideally, you would just be able to
use it by just combining propyl-
ene and oxygen," Linic said.
Currently, producing pro-
pylene oxide requires or yields
hazardous compounds, such
as chlorine or isobutane. Linic
said copper can be used in the
process of catalyzing propylene
and oxygen if in its pure metal-
lic form. However, when oxygen
bonds with copper on the sur-
face of the copper nanoparticle,
it negates its catalytic abilities.
Though copper remains
metallic in the core, the reaction
between the substances occurs
at the surface of copper, so its
core is insignificant. The addi-
tion of a light source, though,
retains copper's catalytic func-
tion.
Linic said light removes
oxygen and reduces the cop-
per oxide coating on copper

MSU receives donation

BABY TALK.

The U.S. Agency for
International Develop-
ment granted $24.5 million
to Michigan State Uni-
versity's Feed the Future
Innovation Lab, The State
News reported Monday.
This money will be used
to research how grain
legumes could be a sustain-
able food source.
Grain legumes are rich
in protein and other nutri-
ents and are cost-effective.
Grown commonly by poor
working families, the beans
provide economic benefits,
especially for women who
must provide food for their
families.

The 12 sub-projects of
the research project will
cover topics like climate-
resilience and nutrition.
The grant will fund the lab
through September 2017.
Dartmouth residences
under investigation
for carcinogen
Dartmouth College
investigators are currently
looking at the presence of
trichloroethylene, a car-
cinogen known as TCE, in
properties the college owns
off campus, The Dart-
mouth reported Tuesday.
The investigation stems

from a concern that TCR
may have traveled from
the nearby the U.S. Army
Cold Regions Research and
Rngineering Laboratory.
Last month, Dartmouth
College was informed TCE
vapor might have extended
beyond its border, and the
army lab discovered Thurs-
day that the basement of a
vacant house nearby levels
of TCE at or above a level
that would require further
investigation.
The nearby Richmond
Middle School is also show-
ing signs of TCE.

LANSING, Mich.
Crew working to
contain oil spill on
Grand River
Cleanup crews were work-
ing Tuesday to contain about
300 to 500 gallons of hydraulic
fluid that spilled from a Lansing
power plant and left a sheen on
the Grand River.
The Board of Water and Light
installed booms - inflated buoys
with pads to absorb the fluid
- across the river, said Brad
Wurfel, a spokesman for the
Michigan Department of Envi-
ronmental Quality.
It was too soon to assess the
spill's effects on the environ-
ment, Wurfel told The Asso-
ciated Press early Tuesday
afternoon.
The spill started Sunday night
and was blamed on a gasket fail-
ure at the utility's Eckert Power

GOP Sen. Kirk
endorses gay
marriage
GOP Sen. Mark Kirk of Illi-
nois on Tuesday became the sec-
ond sitting Republican senator to
endorse gay marriage - a move
that also could shift the political
debate over legalizing gay mar-
riage in Kirk's home state.
Kirk, who has opposed a consti-
* tutional amendment banning gay
marriage, said in a post on his blog
that "same-sex couples should
have the right to civil marriage."
"Our time on this Earth is limit-
ed, I know that better than most,"
said Kirk, who suffered a stroke in
January 2012. "Life comes down
to who you love and who loves you
back- governmenthasno place in
the middle."
Kirk went through months of
rehabilitation before returning to
work in Washington this Janu-
ary. He said in his blog post that he
promised himself he would return
"with an open mind and greater
respect for others."

David Smith, a parent of a

other schools.
Engineering senior Mardan
Niyaz said the event allowed
him to gain a new understand-
ing about drilling for oil.
"I am a chemical engineer,
and this is what we do," Niyz
said. "It is good to know what
political scientists think
about this because we have
totally different views and
a different perspective than
they do."
CSG student general counsel,
said it's quite possible that CSJ
could remand the cases back to
the UEC to hear with a differ-
ent interpretation of the elec-

days after the election has been
ratified and postponement of
the ratification could extend the
terms of current CSG leaders by
several weeks, as was the case

public display and, hopefully,
people will come by," Ortega
added. "We start at the ground
level - working with children
and families - and also in com-
munities."
Social Work student Joyce
Reese-Bey said she helped initi-
ate and plan this event and other
events throughout the month to
achieve better student aware-
ness.
"I feellikeeverychild deserves
to have a childhood that's free
from harm," Reese-Bey said.
"Children don't have anyone to

speak up for them because they
rely on the adults in their lives.
We have to be that voice for those
kids who don't have parents to
stick up for them."
Social Work student Lidi
Armenta saw the event as a way
to reach all students by extenu-
ating the concern for these
children in a visual and easily
accessible way.
"I'm a Child Welfare Scholar,
and there's a cohort of about ten
of us every year," Armenta said.
"We really felt like we wanted
to commit to taking it beyond
our academic endeavors by rais-
ing awareness of child abuse and
neglect."
Ortega said many students in
the Social Work School decide to

come to the University because it
affords them more opportunities
to help children.
"Students who come here have
experienced working with chil-
dren and come back to school to
work on their master's degree so
they can go out and do a lot more
in terms of advocacy and social
change," Ortega said.
Social Work student Dominic
Ortega said there will be other
events later this month that aim
to highlight Child Abuse Preven-
tion.
"We're doing the pinwheels
today, and then we have some
signs that kids came up with
about why kids matter," he said.
"There's been a lot of involve-
ment in this program."

While Linic and his team
have discovered a way to halt

be used to reverse the effects of

He said the University's aca-

gram's focus on leadership and
communication help to build a
well-rounded individual.
In his speech, Shun said even
as the world and armed forces
change, it is important to be
an active, invested leader. He
stressed that a good leader is a
good learner, working together
with those in his or her com-
mand.
"You can't be an e-mail lead-
er," Shun said. "They want the
real thing."
Nursing senior Courtney
Pierce, a member of the Army
Nurse Corps, received the
Daughters of the American Rev-
olution Award, which honors
those with lineage to the Revo-
lutionary War. She has received
two awards for academics in
previous years but said this
award was special.
"I kind of like this award a
little better," Pierce said. "It
doesn't focus that much on aca-
demics and I like it because it
represents the whole half-rea-
son why I joined ROTC, for the

simple as shining light."
Additionally, the compound's
commercial possibilities

bined to form propylene oxide.
Though this is an improvement
from the 20-percent yield rate
of a light-free reaction, Linic
said the commercial sector
would likely prefer a rate above
80 percent.
Commercialization of the
compound would also entail
designing a special reactor to
ensure the light reaches each
particle of copper. However,
Linic said the research's bot-
tom line was its development of
a theory.
"The most important thing
here is that you can shine light
and change the outcome of a
reaction fundamentally."

LSA senior Kyle Ayers, a Cadet
Sergeant Major in Army ROTC,
received recognition as a gradu-
ating member of the Scabbard

the Lt. Norman Carl Anschuetz
II Memorial Award. This award
included a sword, signifying
Aires's substantial success in
leadership and advancing the
battalion.
Ayers said even though he
joined the ROTC only last year;
the battalion has improved leaps
and bounds since he's been there.
"They make sure that they
can complete the Michigan
course load and still have time
to do the ROTC prep that they
need," he said.
Ayers said he was happy to
see the increased interaction
between the older students
and the underclassmen. He
said members have a sense that
ROTC is not just a hobby, but
also a career.
"I'm proud of the ability that I
had to really mentor underclass-
men and bring them up and try
to instill a sense of respect for
the uniform and respect for the
Army in general."

U.S. votes to
approve the arms
regulation treaty
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- The U.N. General Assembly
overwhelmingly approved the
first international treaty regu-
lating the multibillion-dollar
global arms trade Tuesday, after
a more than decade-long cam-
paign to keep weapons from
falling into the hands of terror-
ists, warlords, organized crime
figures and human rights viola-
tors.
Loud cheers erupted in the
assembly chamber as the elec-
tronic board flashed the final
vote: 154 in favor, 3 against and
23 abstentions.
"This is a victory for the
world's people," U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon said. "The
Arms Trade Treaty will make it
more difficult for deadly weap-
ons to be diverted into the illicit
market. ... It will be a powerful
new tool in our efforts to pre-
vent grave human rights abuses
or violations of international

humanitarian law."
The United States, the world's
biggest arms exporter, voted
yes.
Iran, North Korea and Syria
- all facing arms embargoes
- cast the only no votes. They
argued, among other things,
that the agreement favors major
arms suppliers like the U.S. over
importers that need weapons for
self-defense.
Russia and China, which
are also major arms export-
ers, abstained along with India
and Indonesia, while nuclear-
armed Pakistan voted in favor.
Many Arab countries, including
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and
Qatar, abstained, while Lebanon
voted yes.
Never before has there been
a treaty regulating the global
arms trade, which is estimated
to be worth $60 billion today and
which Amnesty International
predicts will exceed $100 billion
in the next four years.
"Today's victory shows
that ordinary people who care
about protecting human rights
can fight back to stop the gun
lobby dead in its tracks, help-


ing to save countless lives," said
Frank Jannuzi, deputy execu-
tive director of Amnesty Inter-
national USA.
"The voices of reason tri-
umphed over skeptics, treaty
opponents and dealers in death
to establish a revolutionary
treaty that constitutes a major
step toward keeping assault
rifles, rocket-propelled gre-
nades and other weapons out of
the hands of despots and war-
lords who use them to kill and
maim civilians, recruit child
soldiers and commit other seri-
ous abuses."
What impact the treaty will
actually have remains to be
seen. It will take effect 90 days
after 50 countries ratify it, and
a lot will depend on which ones
ratify and which ones don't, and
how stringently it is implement-

Funding mental health
The University and CSG need to make sure CAPS is well-funded
With rising student debt and a shaky job market, stressors
for college students are taking their toll. In the last 10
years, the number of psychological disorders found in
college students has increased: One study by the National Alliance on
Mental Illness shows that 40 percent feel overwhelmed by stress on
a daily basis. Like many colleges and universities, the University has
its own mental health service, Counseling and Psychological Services
to combat these issues. Because of its proven benefits, CAPS has been
flooded with students seeking counseling. It has become increas-
ingly obvious that it does not have the resources to help everyone
who needs it. To ensure that these programs are continued and made
more accessible to students, the responsibility lies in the support of
CSG and additional funding from the University.

The current wait time for a CAPS appoint-
ment is an estimated eight days; however,
students sometimes have had to wait two or
three weeks for an opening. This delay could
be quite damaging to the students who need
help. For urgent cases, CAPS offers imme-
diate appointments as well as a 24/7 crisis
phone line, but the wording on their website
judges an "emergency" with arbitrary time
frames. This wording may make students
question whether their problem is urgent
enough and may discourage them from mak-
ing an appointment. CAPS would also ben-
efit by implementing late-night and weekend
hours so students can get help as soon as they
need it. The necessity of CAPS for students on
campus is growing, and making these chang-
es now is critical to the continued success of
the program.
The fact that CAPS is struggling to keep up
with the demand for its services points to a
problem with University mental health ser-
vices. This issue was brought to light in the
CSG election by independent candidate Scott,
Christopher, who campaigned to expand the
mental health services program in order to

promote campus safety. Though he did not
win the election, it's still crucial that his
promise to work on improving CAPS is car-
ried out by the new CSG president. Although
the University has had budget cuts, a pro-
gram as effective as CAPS should not have to
feel these effects. If anything, CAPS should
receive more funding to expand services.
For example, CAPS offers group counseling,
a form of counseling some students prefer in
order to learn from others. Yet, CAPS only
offers a handful of group counseling sessions
that only apply to a small percentage of stu-
dents. With increased funding, CAPS could
offer more diverse group sessions that appeal
to more students.
With its capable counseling staff, health-
education seminars and stress-reducing
events like Puppy Day, CAPS is an important
and appreciated student resource. Because of
its direct connection to students' well-being
and campus safety, continuing and strength-
ening the success of CAPS is not something
that Qan be casually thrown on the back burn
er. An improvement in the mental health ser-
vices benefits the entire student body.

ately, I've been watching
the popular YouTube web
series "The Lizzie Bennet
Diaries." The
show, which
offers a tart spin
on the Jane Aus-
ten classic Pride
and Prejudice,
reincarnates the
heroine, Eliza-
beth "Lizzie"
Bennet, as a E JENNIFER
modern-day XU
24-year-old
graduate stu-
dent who starts a video blog for a
school project.
I want to put it out there that this
show is brilliant. Each of the 100
episodes is six minutes long at most,
running every Monday and Thurs-
day as a continuous vlog series. And
though the program was designed
to be consumed in short, digestible
diary segments, I've ingested 30 or
40 of them in a few breathless gulps.
There's somethingto be said about
the staying power of the romance
between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.
Darcy, which has endured so many
reformulations over the years yet
isn't stale. One might presume that
"She is tolerable; but not handsome
enough to tempt me" would get old
after its umpteenth utterance by
Darcy doppelgangers in an assort-
ment of coiffures and colloquialisms.
But if you are of this camp, prepareto
be surprised, because "LBD" bursts
with freshness and ingenuity.
Take Mr. Bingley, the adorably
clueless object of Jane Bennet's
affections, who's reinvented as a
rich Chinese medical student from
Los Angeles called "Bing Lee,"
or Mr. Darcy, re-imagined in the
21st century as a taciturn hipster.
What's more, the five Bennet sisters
have become three, with angsty
Mary Bennet relegated to the role
of the forgotten emo cousin and

Kitty Bennet reincarnated as, quite
literally, a kitty cat.
But I think the show's greatest
appeal is the expansiveness of its
fictional cosmos. By that I mean the
characters are dealt with as if they
were real people operating in real
time. Most of the characters have
their own Twitter accounts, where
they flirt, scheme and occasion-
ally reply to real-world followers.
They reblog fan Gifs on their tum-
blrs. Jane Bennet even has a Look-
book, on which she posts links to
the painfully adorable outfits she is
spotted donning in her sister's vid-
eos. For all intents and purposes,
this show is an exercise in voyeur-
ism, perfect for a generation raised
on a healthy diet of Google-search-
ing and Facebook-stalking.
It struck me one day how potent-
ly the show might act as a commen-
tary on the fictionality of real-life
YouTube video bloggers, a large
number of whom have become
brands and characters of their
own. It's not insignificant to men-
tion that "LBD" was co-created by
Hank Green, who together with
his brother John has revolution-
ized the YouTube community with
his own special brand of vlog style.
Part storytelling, part chatty con-
fessional - this style straddles the
line between fiction and nonfiction,
private and public.
Take this guy, who made a name
for himself after reading the entire
"Twilight" series on camera and
endured a very messy (and very pub-
lic) break-up with his girlfriend, who
just so happens to also be aYouTube
star. or this guy, who embarked on
a yearlong project that ordained his
viewers to decide what he ate, when
he shaved and where he moved. Out-
side of the conceit that they've made
the decision to throw their lives onto
the screen for the world to see, these
YouTube "celebrities" aren't distin-
guishable from anybody else you'd

encounter walking down the street.
They're college students with aver-
age faces and average body weights -
they're people who would otherwise
meld in with a crowd full of strang-
ers. Real people.
Reality television
has long occupied
a curious space in
popular culture.
Yet, in many ways, they're not.
Because there's an invisible compo-
nent at play here: money. The You-
Tube Partner Program, a business
venture which awards dollars for
view counts, has imposed a tightly
regulated economic system on what
is and isn't broadcasted online.
Everyone you see onscreen, osten-
sibly engaged in his or her everyday *
lives, is working. They compete for
Twitter followers; they return real-
life events into fodder for video
narratives. They have fans, but fans
of what? Of their characters, their
acting? No, of their lives.
Reality television has long occu-
pied a curious space in popular
culture, with scholars and viewers
alike contending on it's grouping as
art or anthropology. A more accu-
rate genre categorization might be
somethinglike anthropology as art.
When people simultaneously juggle
their lives with their livelihoods,
what makes a pedestrian vlog about
the deliciousness of a Chipotle bur-
rito any different from a television
episode from "The Lizzie Bennet
Diaries?" When does a life cross the
line from fact into fiction? Is there a
difference anymore?

AARICA MARCH I
A powerful partnership

The hunt is on

The state of Michigan is ranked 33rd in
the nation for highest teen birth rates. Last
year alone,- 10,947 children were born to
girls between the ages of 15 and 19. Though
teen birth rates have been declining for
decades now, teen pregnancy continues to
be a problematic issue in the United States,
especially for individuals more susceptible
to poverty and unaccommodating circum-
stances. In order to combat the negative
effects of young motherhood - such as pre-
mature birth, delayed education for infants
and financial troubles - the state of Michi-
gan has looked to the Colorado-based Nurse-
Family Partnership program, which helps
young women, particularly from low-income
backgrounds, smoothly transition from preg-
nancy to motherhood. On March 28, a Michi-
gan law went into effect mandating the use
of evidence-based or promising practices if
the Nurse-Family Partnership receives state
funding. The state should further support the
Nurse-Family Partnership Program by imple-
menting program standards that educate
young mothers and improve the health and
development of their children.
In the early 1970s, David Olds, a professor
at the University of Colorado, Denver, created
the initial idea for the Nurse-Family Partner-
ship program after witnessingthe difficulties
lower-income children face at urban day-
cares. Olds developed a program to help first
time, low-income mothers and their children,
which eventuallytransformed into the Nurse-
Family Partnership Program. As of July 2012,
'41 states across the nation have adopted some
-form of Nurse-Family Partnership.
Basically, the program assigns nurses to
"visit struggling mothers around their 28th
week of pregnancy. The at-home visits last
,approximately 90 minutes and cover a variety
of topics. The nurse will work with the moth-

er to counsel her on maternity health and give
her advice on child development, health and
education. These visits last until the infant
reaches the age of two. Many of the nurses
also help the teen mothers start a career. In
2010, it was estimated that the program cost
$12,500 per woman for three years of vis-
its. On average, states that have adopted the
program will prevent 78 premature births,
73 second-births to teen mothers and 3.4
infant deaths per 1,000 low-income families
enrolled.
Currently, Michigan has programs in
every county, but they vary in funding and
services. The state government should imple-
ment clearer standards and help finance
the non-profit organization in order to help
Michigan's teen mothers raise their children
to meet developmental milestones. Instead of
independent operations, each county should
collaborate to potentially increase the posi-
tive effects of the program throughout the
state. Some counties are struggling with long
waitlists while other counties are actively
searching for families to fit its models of ser-
vice. "There's not a shortage of people who
need services; we just need to do a better job
of connecting people to programs," said Amy
Zaagman, executive director of the Michigan
Council for Maternal and Child Health.
In the long run, Nurse-Family Partner-
ship programs will save the state money by
preventing children from entering Child
Protective Services and juvenile homes, and
preparing them for their future education.
Michigan - and states throughout the nation
- should implement a Nurse-Family Partner-
ship program standard across the board. It's a
first step to creating healthier and better edu-
cated mothers and children.

t's that dreaded time of the
year again: internship season.
The hunt is on, and it's a fierce
one. Resembling
something very
close to The
Hunger Games,
internship sea-
son is a battle.
Findingthe
perfect summer
internship to SARAH
complete your SKALUBA
resume, pro-
vide you with
much needed experience and pos-
sibly - just possibly - help you snag
that coveted dream job is invalu-
able. Regardless of school, class or
concentration, University students
across campus are putting on their
bestgame face and compiling
resumes that make even the bright-
est of us envious.
As if midterms weren't reason
enough to worry, add to this the
immense pressure of finding an A-list
internship -innowhere else but New
York, Chicago or Washington D.C., of
course - and it's easy to understand
why so many of us are feeling rather
anxious. It's a cutthroat, dog-eat-dog
world out there, and when it comes to
landing the ideal summer internship,
the competition only heightens.
I mean, there's no shame in call-
ing it quits and spending a fifth
consecutive summer lifeguarding
at home, right?
Don't get me wrong, there's
absolutely nothing wrong with life-
guarding, waitressing or babysit-
ting for the millionth summer in a
row. That's exactly what I did my
first summer back home, and my
measly salary almost managed to
cover the six weeks I spent "study-
ing" in Spain. But this summer is
different. I'm no longer the hope-
less, confused freshman I was three
years ago. As much as I'd love to roll

aimlessly around my hometown all
summer or travel the world with the
money I don't have, it's no longer a
viable option. Somewhere along the
way I grew up. I declared a double
major, discovered my niche and
decided it's time to plunge into this
season's Hunger Games.
So here I am: still internship-less,
anxious and ready to politely smack
the next person who brags about
his or her killer salary and summer
bonus to me - if you're a friend or
person I actually care about, I'll glad-
ly make an exception. Nevertheless,
I'm on a serious prowl to lock some-
thing down for the summer before
I'm stuck back home living on the
streets, considering my mother will
most definitely be barricading the
doors if I can't find some useful way
to spend my four-months of freedom.
But when I accidentally overhear
my fellow peers bragging about the
multitude of internships they've
already applied for, or learn about
the casual $25-an-hour my friends in
the Business School will be making,
I can't help but feel a touch disheart-
ened. Just last week one of my room-
mates in the College of Engineering
received a gift basket from a compa-
ny before even accepting their offer.
Were we ecstatic for her? Yes. Were
we wondering where our presents
werePOf course.
At this point, I'm praying my LSA
expertise will land me a job sort-
ing paperclips or counting ballpoint
pens somewhere on the East Coast.
Rather melodramatic, I know, but I
truly wish this whole process wasn't
so damn cutthroat. I have friends
who legitimately avoid B-Schoolers
during recruitment so that they don't
have to listen to the constant rant-
ing and stressing which just adds to
everyone's anxiety, fueling the manic
nature of the hunt.
The tears and sobs following a
rejection letter, the excited Face-

book status following an offer
- I've witnessed both. Hell, I've
even received those much-dreaded
rejection letters myself and man-
aged to survive. I think at times
we become so wrapped up in this
hunt that we fail to recognize that
regardless of what happens, we'll
be alright. In the grand scheme of
things, landing the ideal summer
internship may seem like the end-
all be-all of our college careers, but
there's so much more to it than that.

And it resembles
something very
close to The
Hunger Games.

When one door closes for us, new
ones open. We gain the opportunity
to explore different interests, try
something new and push ourselves
out of our comfort zone. Maybe we
didn't land that incredible intern-
ship in the heart of New York City
with a fabulous wage and bonus.
But on the plus side, we did gain the
opportunity to seize a new experi-
ence and explore the boatload of
other options out there.
No one likes being rejected from
anything whether it's an intern-
ship, job or coveted leadership posi-
tion. However, we need to step back
for a moment and realize that the
internship quest is not the earth-
shattering situation we make it out
to be. There will always be more
opportunities that lie ahead, and,
in the meantime, whoever said Ann
Arbor isn't a classy place to spend
the summer?

One final practice at Crisler
for seniors before Final Four

SOFTBALL
Michigan offense
on feverish pace

A graduating class
that didn't play
much but found
ways to contribute
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan men's basket-
ball team was standing around
the top of the key at Crisler
Center Tuesday, watching each
senior take the final shots of
practice.
Josh Bartelstein dribbled
to the paint and slammed the
ball home while his teammates
cheered him on, and Eso Akunne
and Matt Vogrich each took a
final 3-pointer. The Wolverines
gathered at center court for a
talk and then practice was over.
Just like that, the five seniors
- Bartelstein, Akunne, Vogrich,
Corey Person and Blake McLi-
mans - had wrapped up their
careers at Crisler.
"I'm happy for them," said
freshman guard Nik Staus-
kas. "They've all had success-
ful careers for them, there's
no better way to end it going to
the Final Four in their last year.
We're proud for them, and we
want to win this one for them."
For most of the team, the last
practice of the year is a weird
feeling - they won't have man-
datory practice until the fall
- but it's even stranger for Bar-
telstein, Akunne, Vogrich, Per-
son and McLimans, who won't
return after spending four, or,
in Person's case, five years at
Crisler.
The five seniors haven't been
an integral part of the team on
gameday, as each player aver-
ages no more than six minutes
per game. Vogrich started six
contests before being replaced
by Stauskas, and Person does a
dance in the huddle before tipoff
in each game, but besides that,
none of the five have seen much
playing time.
But they got to experience
0 things that most Michigan bas-
ketball seniors never got to
experience. Bartelstein was the
first player to cut down the net
at Cowboys Stadium on Sunday,
signaling Michigan's return to
the Final Four for the first time
in 20 years, and the five seniors
got to watch the unveiling of the
2012 Big Ten Champions banner
from the Crisler Center rafters
this season. The title was Michi-
gan's first in 26 years.

has said all season that the five
seniors have played an equally
important role on the team. Bar-
telstein was named captain at the
beginning of this season because
of his selflessness and dedication
to the team, and Akunne and
Person are vocal leaders on the
bench.
But their most important role
has been as the scout team. The
seniors spend hours studying
opponents' offenses during film
sessions, and Beilein has even
joked that the five seniors know
the other Big Ten teams' offenses
better than Michigan's own.
"I know how important they
are," Beilein said. "That scout
team we have is really impor-
tant. That's one of our biggest
concerns next year - what are
we going to dowithout those five
guys?
They have hardly done any-
thing on the court this year
except cleanup time, what are we
going to do to simulate that?"
Though the departure of the
five seniors is overshadowed by
the possibility of multiple play-
ers leaving for the NBA, the loss
will still be felt by Michigan.
Beilein has stressed the value of
the scout team and how each of
the five seniors has a specific role
on the team, and Beilein doesn't
know how to replace that. But
Beilein may be faced with anoth-
er challenge should sophomore
Trey Burke or junior Tim Hard-
away Jr. decide to leave for the
NBA.

In the second game of a
doubleheader against Penn
State on Saturday, sophomore
catcher Lauren Sweet delivered
the Wolverines' first run with
a double to right-center field
en route to a career day at the
plate.
"We're contagious," Sweet
said.
Of late, offense for the No. 12
Michigan softball team (6-0 Big
Ten, 28-7 overall) has been just
that: contagious.
Michigan sent 12 batters to
the plate in the first inning of
game one, capitalizing on five
walks with four hits. With two
runners on in the third, fresh-
man shortstop Sierra Romero
drove her 11th home run of the
season over the right-field wall.
The Wolverines sent all nine
batters up to the plate to extend
the lead to 11-0.
Before the contest, Sweet
was the Wolverines' weakest
hitter, batting just .167 through
the first 30 games of the season.
But recently, it appears that
Sweet too has caught a case of
power hitting.
Sweet's hot hitting began in
the second game of a double-
header versus Purdue. Down
7-2, the sophomore drove a ball
into the last row of the right-
field bleachers to start the
comeback.
This past weekend, Sweet
set four personal records with
four hits - three of which were
doubles - three runs and five
RBI. In her second at-bat, the
sophomore extended the lead to
5-0 with her third home run of
the season and her third in two
weeks.
"We have the offense to come
back if we're down," Sweet said.
"It's a huge weapon."
For an offense that relied
primarily on the bat of fresh-
man shortstop Sierra Romero
through non-conference play,
production throughout the
batting order has resulted in
10-straight victories by an aver-
age margin of 5.6 runs. The
streak has improved the Wol-

verines' team batting average
to.329.
"We're a very contagious
team," Romero said. "When one
of us is hitting, we just all keep
it going. Sometimes it's bad if
we're not hitting because we
rely on one another. It's really
nice when we get into those
streaks because everyone is
seeing the ball come off the bat
really well."
The same contagious offense
has produced 62 runs in Michi-
gan's first six games of Big Ten
play, moving it up to 12th in the
polls and earning the team sole
possession of first place in the
conference.
After a slow March, sopho-
more pitcher Sara Driesenga
moved from the clean-up spot
down to sixth in the batting
order.
In her place, Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins called on junior
first baseman Caitlin Blanchard
to hit behind Romero. In an
18-run mercy-rule victory over
the Nittany Lions, Blanchard
went 3-for-4 with three runs
scored.
"I think (Blanchard) has
done a job great in her role
behind (Romero)," Hutchins
said. "It's been the theme of our
season of late. I think we have
hit through the lineup. If Romo
is going to get on base, we need
to make her a run. We've done a
good job of that."
Among the other Wolverines
starting to heat up is freshman
outfielder Sierra Lawrence.
During opening weekend at
Alumni Field, Lawrence had six
hits and three RBI to improve
her season batting average to
.341
Michigan is undefeated in
the six games in which Law-
rence has helped turn the line-
up over. ,., ,t t ,
"She's definitely matured,"
Hutchins said. "She's had to
work through a lot this season,
and she's almost there."
With the pitching staff hold-
ing opponents to just five hits
and two runs per game, Michi-
gan is in position to dominate
the Big Ten in pursuit of its
sixth straight conference title.

After senior pitcher Ben Bal-

Michigan coach Erik Bakich
gathered the team around him
and offered up three simple
words: "Win it for Ben."

a combination of pitchers held
the Falcons (2-4 Mid-American
Conference, 6-17 overall) score-
less, making it just the second
shutout of the year.
"We were some big hits away
from blowing the game open
offensively," Bakich said. "But
the pitching did exactly what
we needed it to do, we needed to
keep it at a shutout or a one-run
(game).
"Pitching had to step up, and
pitching stepped up."
Michigan took the early lead
by scoring a single run in both
the first and second innings.
With two outs in the first inning,
junior right fielder Michael
O'Neill laid down a perfect bunt
for a hit to lead off and then stole
second.
Sophomore left fielder Zach
Zott singled O'Neill home for
the first run of the game.
In the second inning, the Wol-
verines were able to score with-
out ever recording a hit. Two
walks followed by two errors
were enough to plate sophomore
Dylan Delaney for Michigan's
second run for the game.
"It's nice to score first, it's

Michigan coach Red Berenson
noted last week that it was a toss-
up whether Trouba would stay
for another year or leave. Beren-
son and Trouba both added that
the desire to stay another year to
work toward an education was
on Trouba's agenda.
"Being here has been probably
one of the most fun years I've
ever had playing hockey on and
off the ice," Trouba said. "This is
a lot of fun, and it's a hard place
to leave. Getting my education
is something I want to do, and
another year towards that would
be a big step."
Trouba's loss leaves the Wol-
verines with five returning
defensemen: juniors Mac Ben-
nett and Kevin Clare as well
as sophomores Mike Chiasson,
Mike Szuma and Brennan Ser-
ville. Michigan has three incom-
ing freshmen on the blue line,

the pressure off the guys when
they are playing with the lead
versus playing from behind."
Heading into the third
inning, it was the pitching staff's
responsibility to hold that lead.
But that's when Ballantine got
injured. He was covering first
base on a ball hit to the right side
of the infield and severely hurt
his ankle. Ballantine, who was
visibly and audibly in pain, has
been a key factor in the pitching
rotation with a 2.91 ERA on the
year, and had three strikeouts
during his short appearance
today. Ballantine underwent
surgery Tuesday night, and his
status is unknown for the rest of
the season.
If Ballantine is unable to
return this year it will be a big
loss for Michigan, since he has
been a key right-handed arm in
the rotation.
"You never want to see a
friend or a teammate go down,"
O'Neill said. "As the game goes
on, you don't really think about
stuff like that, you just have to
let it go and think about it after
the game and give him his con-
dolences."

But pitching without Ballan-
tine wasn't an issue after he got
hurt. Sophomore right-hander
Matt Ogden, senior right-hander
Kyle Clark and freshman right *
hander Jacob Cronenworth gave
up just five hits and struck out
seven in the shutout.
"We pitched well today, from
Ballantine to Ogden to Clark to
Croney," Bakich said. "Those
guys pounded the strike zone.
That's what we talked about
before the game, like we always
talk about, quick tempo, force
contact. And that's exactly what
happened, and they did a really
good job of doing that."
The defense also played an
integral part in the shutout,
helping the pitchers escape from
several jams. Cronenworthmade
a diving catch up the middle in
the fourth that likely saved a
run from scoring, and freshman
infielder Travis Maezes, with
the help from Cronenworth,
turned a double play in the
eighth that thwarted a poten-
tial rally. O'Neill also recorded
a running, over-the-shoulder
catch in the eighth inning steps
short of the warning track.

letter from the editor
We tell stories.
We get tackled by football players, side-eyed
by the U.S. Secret Service and our motto is to ask
forgiveness, not permission. You can always go
back to ask for another quote, do another interview
or pull a brilliant phrase out of a corner of your
mind. But when the people leave and the lights go
down, you cannot capture another frame.
These are the photos of the year; moments
pulled from life, our photo staff's viewfinders and
the pages of the Daily. They range from portraits
of professors and fire chiefs to action shots
highlighting the human emotion that comes from
winning an election or a spot in the Elite Eight.
We don't have pens and notebooks. The
recorders we use document images, not sound. And
while we all have our preferred subjects - sports,
students, puppies - we are bound together by our
desire to tell stories through photographs. They say
a picture is worth a thousand words, and so this
issue is essentially a 22,000-word love letter to
you from the photo staff of The Michigan Daily. We
freeze moments in time so you can remember them
or discover them for the first time.
Our photographs are our stories, and these
are our photos of the year.
