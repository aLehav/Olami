Around 50 people gathered 

in the Vandenberg Room of the 
Michigan League on Thursday 
for 
the 
Communication 

Studies Department’s annual 
Howard R. Marsh Lecture 
in 
Journalism, 
delivered 

this year by investigative 
journalist Will Potter.

Potter’s talk, titled “From 

Protester 
to 
Terrorist: 

The Mechanisms of State 
Repression,” highlighted his 
own career as a journalist 
and the ways he discovered 
the United States government 
systematically 
discredits 

activist movements in order 
to protect corporate interests.

He said he became obsessed 

with investigating the FBI’s 
tactics after he was arrested 
for hanging leaflets against 
animal testing on doors. The 
FBI then offered him career 
help in exchange for becoming 
an informant.

“Two FBI agents came to 

my home, and they knew all 
about where I worked, and 
how my dad had to cosign 
for our apartment at the time 
because I didn’t have enough 
money, and I had a Fulbright 
(scholarship) 
pending, 
and 

my girlfriend at the time had 
some Ph.D. funding, and they 
said they could make all this 
go away, unless I helped them 
by spying on protest groups,” 
he said. “And they made a 

point of emphasizing you 
know, you have this upward 
career trajectory, you’re doing 
everything right, just make it 
all easier on yourself, or you’re 
going to be put on a domestic 
terrorist list. It scared the 
daylights out of me.”

The majority of Potter’s 

talk was spent breaking down 
his “10 easy steps to turn 
protesters 
into 
terrorists”: 

using the power of language, 

waging 
media 
campaigns, 

holding government hearings, 
dividing, 
conducting 

surveillance, advocating for 
disproportionate 
sentences, 

creating informants, passing 
laws against dissent, creating 
special prisons and expanding 
to the mainstream.

Many 
of 
the 
laws 

criminalizing dissent, Potter 
pointed 
out, 
were 
passed 

without the knowledge of 

many 
people, 
including 

lawmakers. 
To 
pass 
the 

Animal Enterprise Terrorism 
Act, which makes causing a 
loss of profits to an animal 
enterprise an act of terrorism, 
Congress used an obscure 
procedure called “suspension 
of the rules” to get the bill 
through with the minimum 
oversight possible.

“This is how a lot of bills 

Economic 
Prof. 
Edward 

Cho was teaching his Econ 
102 
class, 
macroeconomics, 

Thursday afternoon when a 
student raised his hand to ask 
a question. When called on by 
Cho, the student asked: “Do 
you like apples?” 

Cho appeared confused and 

the student reiterated, “What 
about a golden apple?” The 
doors at the back of the lecture 
hall then opened to reveal the 
other members of the Golden 
Apple committee, the graduate 
student instructors for the 
class and other members of 
the Economics department, all 
holding balloons and flowers.

This was how Cho was 

awarded the Golden Apple

The Michigan Legislature is 

currently addressing expansions 
and limitations to the Freedom 
of Information Act in Michigan 
through two bills: Senate Bill 
0069 and House Bill 4149.

FOIA, a federal law that took 

effect in 1967, allows individuals 
in Michigan to submit requests 
to access public information. 
Michigan has ranked poorly in 
issues of transparency, in part 
because of weak or absent state 
laws about public records and 
disclosures.

HB 
4149 
would 
expand 

FOIA requests to include the 
governor’s office and the state 
legislature. The Committee on 
Michigan Competitiveness is 
currently evaluating the bill in 
the House of Representatives.

In a phone interview, state 

Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi 
(D–Ann 

Arbor) said he believes the 
legislation is a priority and feels 
encouraged to see bipartisan 
support on the issue.

“We live in one of the 

worst states when it comes to 
transparency in government, we

One former University of 

Michigan faculty member and 
one current University faculty 
member are joining together 
to bring a lawsuit against the 
University under the Michigan 
Elliott-Larsen 
Civil 
Rights 

Act, making claims of racial 
discrimination and harassment. 

The 
Elliott-Larsen 
Civil 

Rights Act, passed in 1976, 
prohibits discrimination based 
on “religion, race, color, national 
origin, age, sex, height, weight, 
familial 
status, 
or 
marital 

status,” in employment and 
education, among other areas.

The 
plaintiffs 
— 
Scott 

Kurashige, 
an 
assistant 

professor in the History and 
American Culture Departments 
from 2000 to 2014, and Emily 
Lawsin, 
a 
lecturer 
in 
the 

Women’s Studies and American 
Culture 
Departments 
since 

2000 –– are seeking over 
$25,000 in damages in the form 
of lost salaries and emotional 

harm. Kurashige and Lawsin 
have been married since they 
began teaching at the University 
in 
2000, 
and 
are 
being 

represented by attorney Alice 
Jennings and Carl Edwards of 
the Detroit law firm Edwards & 
Jennings, PC. 

According to Jennings, the 

University violated the Elliott-
Larsen Act in multiple ways, 
including discrimination based 
on the plaintiffs’ marriage.

“The 
primary 
issue 
is 

disparate treatment,” Jennings 
said. “They have been treated 
differently than others who 
are 
not 
similarly 
situated 

for racial reasons. Secondly, 
there’s an issue of hostile 
work 
environment, 
meaning 

that individual is made to feel 
different in a way that is painful 
both intellectually as well as 
emotionally.”

The 
lawsuit 
claims 
both 

Kurashige and Lawsin were 
consistently passed over for 
promotions and raises, despite 
each receiving high acclaim in 
their respective fields.

S4J wants activism space separate from Trotter, similar to former Baker-Mandela Center

In response to the racist and anti-

semitic email hackings last month, 
the University of Michigan student 
organization 
Students4Justice 

published a public list of demands for 
University President Mark Schlissel, 
one of which was the creation of 
a physical space for students of 
color on campus to organize and 
enact social change. The request 
has since gained traction. S4J Core 
Organizer Lakyrra Magee, LSA 

junior, has confirmed the group has 
found a temporary space for student 
activists to work, but has no official 
funding or physical center as of yet.

In its demands, S4J said the new 

activism center should be separate 
from the Trotter Multicultural 
Center and should be specifically 
for students of color — allowing 
students 
access, 
with 
special 

recognition toward minorities. 

Magee said S4J wants the 

center’s budget to include a library 
for social movement literature for 
activists. She also said the use of 
the library as an archive for the 

University’s activism history is 
crucial to the group’s plan.

“We also want archived past 

University work, so we want it to 
have access to previous movements 
from students, both online and 
in paper and news articles and 
things like that, that documents 
all of the activism that’s happened 
throughout 
the 
years 
at 
the 

University of Michigan,” she said. 
“We also just want it to be a space 
for students to get together in order 
to better prepare themselves to do 
said work.”

S4J Core Organizer Vikrant 

Garg, a Public Health student, 
said a new activism center would 
spark more social innovation on 
campus. He cited institutions such 
as the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center, minority 
cultural lounges and others as ideas 
that have been created by students.

“If you think about it ideologically, 

what a student activist center would 
be would be a center that really 
fosters a lot of what has made this 
University better over time,” Garg 
said. “There are so many things that 
have been created at this University

LSA senior Lakshman 

Mulpuri and Rackham student 

Trevis Harrold, Central Student 

Government representatives, 

recently launched a program through 

the University of Michigan app 

that allows students to view how 

many people are currently in the 

Recreational Sports facilities, as well 

as what equipment is being used.

The model is very similar to 

one of the app’s features that tracks 

how full dining halls are. Mulpuri 

and Harrold worked with College 

of Engineering students and 

Information and Technology Services 

to create the program and add it to 

the official University app.

The representatives said CSG 

made a donation to the recreation 

buildings to buy iPads. Then, every 

half hour, recreation employees walk 

around the building and count how 

many people are using the equipment. 

“It gives you a sense of how busy 

(the gym) is,” Mulpuri said. “It tells 

you how many people are in each 

room, lifting, running, swimming 

is actually on there too, the lounges, 

the racquetball courts. At the top of 

the app, it’ll also say what time it’s 

been updated at, and it’s really useful 

because a lot of students 

have told me that this is 

something that they’d like.” 

Mulpuri added this was 

a project he and Harrold 

been trying to work on for 

a while, and they had to go 

through multiple meetings 

with managers and faculty 

at different centers to have it 

implemented.

Harrold said he was 

proud to see the application 

running after their hard 

work.

“It was a really long 

process, even getting the 

money allocated to different 

(recreation) centers, we were 

very involved with that, but 

it was good to see it actually 

usable and working,” Harrold said.

The program can be accessed 

through the University app from 

the Student Life tab and is currently 

collecting data from the Central 

Campus Recreational Building, the 

North Campus Recreational Building 

and the Intramural Sports Building.

Discussions 
surrounding 

issues of race and gender in the 
world of University of Michigan 
research and academia were 
prominent during a lecture 
for undergraduate researchers 
held Thursday afternoon. 

Around 
40 
students 

gathered in a classroom in 
Haven Hall to hear a panel 
of 
speakers 
discuss 
issues 

of gender and race in the 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity 
Program, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

program 
for 
involving 

undergraduates in research 
projects with faculty.

The panel was moderated by 

one of UROP’s social science 
peer 
advisors, 
LSA 
senior 

Adedolapo Adeniji who asked 

the panelists questions. At 
the end of the discussion, 
the students were allowed to 
ask the panelists their own. 
 

Adeniji sought answers that 
would help students learn 
more about research, including 
how to find a mentor, how to 
seek out support and how race 
and gender have played a role 
in the paths of the panelists.

Panelist 
Sara 
Adlerstein 

Gonzalez, 
an 
associate 

research 
scientist 
in 
the 

School of Natural Resources 
and Environment, discussed 
what it means to be a woman 
in a male-dominated research 
field.

“Being a person of color and 

a female and younger, you get 
questioned a lot in terms of 
your research or your ideas,” 
she said. “You get challenged 
in ways that maybe your male 
or white counterparts aren’t 

challenged. So, if anything, 
you learn to push back, you 
learn to defend your ideas.”

American 
Culture 
Prof. 

Yeidy Rivero, another panelist, 
discussed 
mentorship 
in 

research and how it relates to 
race.

“Because I am a woman and 

I am Latina does not mean I 
am the perfect mentor for a 
Latino person, you know what 
I mean?” she asked. “My first 
mentor was a white male. 
And he was wonderful and 
I adore him and he was my 
dissertation adviser.”

In an interview following 

the panel, Rivero discussed 
the importance of talking to 
undergraduates.

“We 
as 
scholars 
should 

devote a lot of attention to 
our undergraduates and part 
of that is to talk about what is 
going on in society, and gender 

and race are key issues 
today,” she said.

In the interview she also 

commented on the way the 
University addresses racial 
issues higher up in the 
research community.

“I think the University 

is trying very hard to tell 
you the truth, to deal with 
those issues,” she said. “I 
think each department is 
different, of course, but 
I think the University is 
putting in a lot of effort and 
funds for that … I think many 
people are unaware of their 
own sexism and racism. 
They make comments and 
you are like ‘Oh my god.’ 
Believe it or not, I think 
people should be trained. It 
doesn’t matter that you have 
a Ph.D.”

Kinesiology junior Riley 

Engstrom commented on 
the diversity within UROP.

of the Golden Apple Award, 
naming him Professor of the 
Year. The whole lecture hall 
erupted in cheers, and Cho 
looked on, smiling from the 
front of the room. After the 
award was explained, Cho 
delivered an impromptu thank 
you speech. 

“When I was a little kid, I 

thought my dream would be 
to be a professional wrestler,” 
Cho started, causing the class 
to erupt with laughter. “I 
realized that wasn’t going to 
happen with this body, and so 
this is more or less a dream 
come true.”

This was the 27th annual 

Golden Apple Award, which 
is the only award at the 
University that is comprised 
soley of student nominations. 
Economics Prof. Jim Adams, 
who 
received 
the 
Golden 

Apple Award in 1998, made 
a speech in front of the class 
congratulating Cho on this 
honor.

“There 
are 
about 
4,100 

members of the instructional 
faculty at Michigan,” Adams 
began. “In the entire history 
of this award, only 26 people 
have won it. If you do the 
math, 26 divided by 4,100, you 
get something under 1 percent. 

More like one-half of one 
percent of the faculty at the 
University of Michigan have 
won this award. I would say 
that’s in the A+ category.”

Adams went on to discuss 

the importance of this award, 
noting that the fact that it is 
chosen only by students makes 
it 
a 
particularly 
priceless 

recognition for someone who 

values his students as much as 
Cho.

However, 
it 
isn’t 
only 

students who say they love 
working with Cho — his GSIs, 
when asked, say they find him 
to be a great teacher. Rackham 
student Ivy Tran, who started 
working with Cho this year, 
said he has been one of her 

favorite teachers to work 
with.

“In terms of the energy 

he brings to the classroom, 
(Cho) is really great,” Tran 
said. “He always has jokes 
and finds a way to make 
economics really interesting, 
even for a graduate student. 
It’s a way different experience 
than I ever had taking these 
courses. He really cares to 
make sure the students have 
the resources with me, and 
I feel like even though it’s 
a 300-person lecture, each 
student still feels like they 
have a personal connection 
with Dr. Cho.”

During 
the 
class, 
the 

students had multiple things 
they 
chanted 
throughout 

the surprise announcement, 
which students said were 
things Cho and his students 
often do as a way of bringing 
the 
class 
together. 
Cho 

said “Yuh!” The students 
responded by repeating the 
call in unison, laughing as 
they celebrated this award 
with their professor.

On April 3, Cho will accept 

his award and deliver a “last 
lecture.” LSA senior Rachel 
Liang, a who was a part of the 
award 
selection 
committee, 

described 
the 
last 
lecture, 

which is a tradition that all 
of the winners of the Golden 
Apple Award participate in 

as a reminder that professors 
should always teach as though 
it was their last day teaching.

“The theme of the lecture is 

basically to convey the idea of 
teaching every day as if it was 
your last, and giving your best 

every day to students,” Liang 
said. “The winner every year 
embodies that idea and that 
spirit that we want to spread 
throughout the University, and 
that’s why we do what we do.”

At the end of the surprise, 

Cho gave one final speech to 
show his gratitude.

“I’m pretty much speechless 

right now,” Cho said. “You 
know when in this situation, 
I have a call that we all 
understand.”

According to the plaintiffs, both 
of whom are Asian-American, the 
reason they weren’t considered 
for 
advancement 
was 
racially 

motivated.

“Even 
with 
the 
requisite 

raise 
for 
promotion 
effective 

Fall 
2012, 
Plaintiff’s 
salary 

remained at the university’s scale 
minimum, far below average for 
his rank, and well below that of 
faculty with comparable or less 
accomplishments,” 
the 
lawsuit 

reads.

The lawsuit asserts Kurashige’s 

continued pursuit of discrimination 
claims against the University led to 
his 2013 termination as Director 
of the Asian and Pacific Islander 
American Studies Program, and his 
later blacklisting by his colleagues, 
which 
effectively 
forced 
him 

to resign from his position as 
professor in 2014.

Additionally, 
the 
University 

attempted to terminate Lawsin’s 
employment in 2015, while she was 
on leave to care for a baby with 
Down syndrome, and has barred 
her from teaching her previously 
scheduled classes for the winter 
2017 semester, which the lawsuit 
claims was a result of her reporting 
discrimination against herself and 
other faculty and students. 

In addition to their own personal 

accounts of discrimination, the 
plaintiffs’ 
complaints 
contain 

demographic information about 
the University for the purpose of 
illustrating a culture of racial bias 

and censorship.

“The composition of UM faculty 

also contradicts the institution’s 
rhetorical commitment to diversity 
and equity,” the complaint reads. 
“Of the 3,096 tenured and tenure-
track faculty at UM, 74 percent are 
white, 15.8 percent are Asian (a 
large portion being international 
scholars), 4.3 percent are Black, 
4.1 percent are Hispanic, 0.4 
percent are Native American, and 
0.1 percent are Native Hawaiian/

Pacific Islander. At the rank of full 
professor, 80 percent are white and 
73 percent are male.”

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
would be contesting the charges, 
but provided no further details.

“We will vigorously defend the 

university against this lawsuit,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email to 
the Daily. “In fact, the university 
already has filed a motion to 
dismiss much of the complaint.”

have been fighting this issue 
for years,” Rabhi said. “House 
Republicans and Democrats 
are starting to work together 
on 
legislation 
around 
the 

Freedom of Information Act 
expansion.”

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, 
echoed 
this 

sentiment in an email interview 
and said he fundamentally 
believes 
in 
holding 
the 

government 
accountable 

through FOIA, agreeing that 
more transparency is needed 
in Michigan’s state government 
in order for these values to be 
protected.

“I believe that government 

officials, as public servants 
to 
the 
people, 
must 
be 

obliged to a higher standard 
of 
transparency,” 
Zalamea 

said. 
“The 
people 
cannot 

hold 
their 
publicly 
elected 

officials accountable if crucial 
information 
regarding 
their 

performance 
and 
activities 

remain 
private 
— 
with 

more 
transparency 
in 
our 

government, we the people 
have more influence in making 
sure the people we elect lead 

this state efficiently.”

Rabhi said part of the push for 

this recent activity regarding 
FOIA has come from Michigan 
voters who want to hold the 
state government accountable 
for its actions, particularly in 
light of the Flint Water Crisis.

“This is a very important 

issue 
that 
really 
resonates 

with 
voters 
in 
Michigan,” 

Rabhi said. “People believe 
that government should be 
open, they believe it should be 
transparent and this is one of 
those issues where we need 
to jump in and make sure that 
happens.”

The state House passed a 

similar 
package 
to 
expand 

FOIA to government officials 
with bipartisan support last 
session, but the measure died in 
the state Senate when Majority 
Leader Arlan Meekhof (R–West 
Olive) refused to bring the 
package to a vote, the Detroit 
Free Press reported.

In a response to comment, 

Meekhof’s office said his reason 
for not supporting the earlier 
legislation was out of concern 
that 
sensitive 
constituent 

information could be exposed 
through FOIA.

“The Majority Leader is 

opposed to legislation that 
would 
make 
constituent 

correspondence available under 

FOIA,” a representative from 
the office of Meekhof wrote. 
“Constituents 
often 
contact 

legislative 
offices 
seeking 

assistance 
with 
the 
state 

and may supply personal or 
financial information in seeking 
to resolve issues and the Senator 
does not think such information 
should be available for review 
by the public or media.” 

Rabhi disputed Meekhof’s 

claim 
and 
said 
sensitive 

constituent information would 
continue to be protected from 
FOIA as a part of any legislation 
passed in the House.

“Certain 
sensitive 

constituent information like 
medical information, financial 
information, 
social 
security 

numbers would be redacted 
if an email or communication 
were released,” Rabhi said. 
“That privacy concern I believe 
is dealt with.”

The other bill, SB 0069, would 

work to expand restrict FOIA 
further by exempting company 
secrets and bids from FOIA 
requests in order to promote 
competitiveness. It passed both 
the state Senate and House with 
unanimous bipartisan support.

Rabhi said he voted for the 

bill because he agreed with the 
idea of limiting FOIA requests 
to ensure the bidding process 
for state contracts is fair.

“When a company is bidding 

for 
providing 
services 
to 

the state, there was concern 
that a competitor company 
could FOIA that bid and then 
undercut that bid,” Rabhi said. 
“In a sealed bid environment, 
every company submits their 
bid not knowing what the other 
company has done.”

Zalamea 
said 
he 
fully 

supports the passage of the 
bill and agrees with the idea 
of protecting businesses from 
certain aspects of FOIA to 
promote competition.

“The 
government 
can 

and 
has 
directly 
impeded 

companies’ 
competitiveness 

when they release sensitive 
trade secrets,” Zalamea said. 
“Such information should only 
be released after the trades 
have been made.”

Conversely, 
Public 
Policy 

junior Rowan Conybeare, chair 
of the University’s chapter of 
the College Democrates, said in 
an email interview her position 
is to support FOIA expansions, 
believing limitations of the act 
are a threat to democracy.

“Transparency 
and 

accountability in government 
are essential to our democracy,” 
Conybeare wrote. “Legislative 
attempts to limit the scope of the 
FOIA are impediments to civic 
life and citizen participation.”

get moved through that are 
ostensibly 
non-controversial,” 

Potter said. “That same week, 
the same procedure was used to 
honor the St. Louis Cardinals for 
winning the World Series. Then 
it was used to pass the Animal 
Enterprise 
Terrorism 
Act. 

There were only six members 
of Congress in the room. The 
rest were on the National Mall 
breaking ground on a new 
memorial honoring Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.”

Information master’s student 

Jay Choi said he appreciated 
being 
exposed 
to 
an 
issue 

he wouldn’t otherwise have 
been 
aware 
of 
as 
a 
non-

communications student.

“I actually didn’t give it too 

much thought before I came 
here, but I was really surprised 
at the content of the actual 
lecture and some of the issues 
that journalists are facing,” 
he said. “It’s not every day 
that students from different 
departments get exposed to 
such events and trends in other 
industries so this really helps 
expand 
those 
horizons 
for 

students, in my opinion.”

At the end of the talk, Potter 

warned repression was an issue 
that applied to more than just 
environmentalists, saying the 
power of the state was especially 
dangerous 
under 
President 

Donald Trump’s administration.

“Now of course I lied in my 

BuzzFeed listicle presentation 
here, that there’s not just 10 
steps to how all this happens,” 
he said. “The most important 
point 
is 
that 
there’s 
this 

unspoken final step to repeat the 
entire thing over again against 
different political groups. Right 
now, the main target has been 
environmentalist groups. But 
even if you don’t care about the 
environment, this still affects 
everyone in this room.”

LSA sophomore Lena Dreves 

said 
she 
thought 
Potter’s 

remarks 
were 
something 

everyone needed to hear.

“I thought he really put it 

together really well, and that 
needs to be known by people on 
campus, and, if possible, people 
need to read his book because 
it’s really well-written,” Dreves 
said. “I really liked how he said 
the way that they’re constructing 
this 
certain 
dynamic 
with 

environmentalists, they can do 
with any social group. I thought 
that was a very important piece 
of information.”

by students and by their activism.”

In the University’s 35-page 

response to all of S4J’s initial 
demands, released in February, 
the University said cross-cultural 
spaces already exist on campus, 
an example being The Connector 
that bridges the Michigan Union 
and West Quad Residence Hall. 
The report said the current plan 
for a new Trotter Multicultural 
Center closer to Central Campus 
addresses S4J’s original demand. 
Another future idea outlined in 
the response would create a social 
justice institute, which would 
include areas for student activists 
to work.

However, 
University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
the document is just a starting 
point for discussion, not a final 
decision.

Many students and faculty 

are comparing this request to the 
Baker-Mandela Center for Anti-
Racist Education, a social activism 
space for students that was active 
in the ’80s and ’90s. The BMC 
was founded in 1988 by students 
Premilla 
Nadasen, 
Barbara 

Ransby, Tracye Matthews and 
members of the United Coalition 
Against Racism.

The 
circumstances 

surrounding the BMC’s closing 
are unclear. However, according 
to Fitzgerald, there was never an 
official decision to remove the 

BMC from campus. He said the 
center slowly faded away after the 
founding students started to move 
away or focus on other issues. The 
University could not give specifics 
on when the BMC dismantled 
and the Daily last reported on its 
existence in September 1994. A 
Daily article from November 1995 
reported on students’ calls for its 
reinstatement. 

Nadasen said the incidents 

leading up to the founding of 
UCAR in 1987 and subsequently 
the creation of the BMC, involved 
racist 
flyers 
around 
campus, 

similar to the flyer incidentslast 
semester. She said the purpose 
of the BMC was to not only help 
student activist find resources 
but to bring racial issues into the 
classroom.

“One of the goals of the BMC 

was to create an alternative 
curriculum, one that made the 
theories that we were learning in 
our classes relevant to everyday 
people and to our lives so we 
sought to link intellectualism and 
activism,” she said. “We wanted 
to have a space that was available 
for students of color and we were 
available to all students on the 
campus who were interested in 
anti-racist education.”

In 2013, Rackham student 

Garrett Felber cofounded the 
United 
Coalition 
for 
Racial 

Justice, which took inspiration 
from Nadasen’s UCAR. After 
researching the UCAR and talking 
with former UCAR members 
about the BMC, Felber began 
researching the original center as 

part of a racial justice proposal. In 
an email interview, Felber said the 
BMC had ingrained diversity into 
the center’s functions.

“BMC by-laws specified that the 

board must be a majority women 
and people of color,” Felber wrote. 
“For example, in 1993, it was 74 
percent female, 61 percent Black, 9 
percent Latina, 9 percent LGBTQ.”

Felber said getting funds for 

the BMC was a similar process to 
S4J’s proposal for the new center: 
primarily by the University.

“Funding was provided by 

outside 
philanthropic 
grants 

such as the social justice group, 
Funding Exchange, as well as 
small donations from community 
members, 
fundraising 
events, 

and donations from UM offices,” 
Felber wrote. “Almost 90% of 
funding came from grants, most 
of which were provided by the 
University.”

In response to S4J’s new 

proposal, Felber wrote the plan 
reflects the long traditions Garg 
mentioned of students creating 
change on campus. He wrote 
students are the main purveyors 
for racial justice and program 
innovation at the University.

“Nothing meaningful for racial 

justice on campus comes from 
top-down 
leadership 
models,” 

Felber wrote. “It is only through 
organized, thoughtful study and 
agitation by students and the 
community that administrators 
are pressed to come up with a 
program.”

Research 
fellow 
Austin 

McCoy, who studies and teaches 

about 
racial 
justice, 
believes 

the 
University’s 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion plan needs 
student-run resources like S4J’s 
activism center in order to make a 
difference in campus climate and 
change the University’s outlook on 
social activism.

“If the administrations are 

trying to implement any sort of 
campus-wide Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan, a lot of times 
they’re going to need to be able 
to draw on resources from 
undergrads and grad students 
who are on the ground,” McCoy 
said. “These students are actually 
a resource who are trying to … 
implement DEI policy so I think 
such a (S4J) resource center could 
directly assist this institution.”

Instead of seeing the need for 

another student activism center 
as repeating past efforts with no 
change in between, Nadasen said 
the new center builds off the BMC 
and provides another stepping 
stone in the fight for diversity and 
racial justice.

“There are cycles of student 

organizing and student activism 
and I think those cycles are 
important and they do lead to 
incremental change,” she said. 
“I think the universities of today 
and the University of Michigan 
looks very different today than 
it did 60 years ago and part of 
the reason for that is because 
of the ways in which student 
activism has made demands on 
the University and the ways in 
which they have tried to hold the 
University accountable.”

A

s 
my 
college 
career 

draws 
to 
a 
close, 

I’ve spent some time 

reflecting 
on 
my 

experiences 
here. 

Looking 
back 
at 

the sheer volume of 
work I’ve done, the 
new things I’ve tried 
and the amount I’ve 
grown as a person over 
the past four years 
is 
simultaneously 

amazing 
and 

overwhelming. 
I’m 

proud of the things I’ve 
accomplished as a University 
of 
Michigan 
undergraduate, 

largely because they reflect 
the love I felt for (most of) the 
classes I took and activities I 
participated in.

But, at this point during my 

senior year of high school, I 
envisioned myself spending my 
Wednesday nights partying with 
fraternity men, not attending 
an informational session about 
graduate school fellowships and 
then coming home to write this 
column.

It’s not that I didn’t care 

about school, or really even that 
I was really very interested in 
partying (or fraternity men for 
that matter). Rather, it was just 
what I thought people were 
supposed to do in college. Most 
of the images I had seen of 
college — both on older friends’ 
social media accounts and in 
popular culture — involved 
stylish blonde women either 
wrapped around tall, tan men 
or huddled in massive groups of 
women laughing in Instagram-
worthy 
places. 
I 
imagined 

college 
through 
rose-tinted 

lenses adorned with pearls and 
bows. I didn’t realize that the 
ideas I had developed about how 
college women were “supposed” 
to look and act were not only 
unrealistic but, if left unchecked, 
could be detrimental to my long-
term goals.

Fortunately, 
that 
changed 

shortly after I arrived at the 
University. Older students on 

the Daily staff and 
in 
other 
student 

organizations 
during 
my 
first 

semester 
helped 

me 
get 
involved 

on 
campus 
in 

organizations that 
led me to discover 
deeper 
interests 

in things I ended 
up liking far more 
than the superficial. 

They gave me the courage to 
share my thoughts and opinions 
with the rest of campus through 
the Daily — something I’ve 
been doing ever since. In doing 
so, they taught me to value my 
own voice and to take myself 
seriously 
as 
someone 
who 

deserves to be heard.

I did end up joining a 

sorority 
as 
a 
sophomore 

— when I had personally 
matured enough and learned 
enough about myself and my 
personal priorities to pick an 
organization with ideals and 
women I respected, rather 
than 
just 
an 
aesthetically 

pleasing Tumblr page or an 
impressive 
social 
schedule. 

Through my sorority, I gained 
a community of women who 
support me when I need it and 
respect me for who I am.

Too 
frequently, 
we’re 

encouraged to be pretty faces 
for Instagram posts instead 
of 
strong 
people 
with 
the 

ability to make a real impact. 
Though these things aren’t 
mutually exclusive, living up 
to these outrageous standards 
impedes our efforts to excel in 
school and pursue the things 
we’re passionate about. In 
the workplace, especially in 
male-dominated fields, these 
pressures only intensify.

Yet, with the support of 

older students willing to act 

as my mentors, I learned to 
navigate the pressures and 
expectations 
of 
women 
in 

college and, later, in office 
environments. Many of these 
women were busy themselves, 
but still took the time to serve 
as resources for me as I began 
to get involved on campus, 
search for internships and 
apply to my current college, the 
Ford School of Public Policy.

At my internship this past 

summer, 
management-level 

female employees made an effort 
to mentor and advocate for 
lower-level female employees, 
including 
the 
interns. 
They 

helped me feel welcome at work, 
encouraged me to share my ideas 
and opinions in meetings and 
gave me opportunities to work 
on incredible projects.

Women face challenges at 

school and work that men often 
don’t, such as wage gaps and not 
being taken as seriously as their 
male counterparts. Big picture: 
building a society where women 
have the full opportunity to 
contribute all they can to our 
economy and government will 
require that we remove social, 
legal and economic barriers for 
women 
pursuing 
educational 

and occupational opportunities. 
Greater female representation in 
every arena — from government 
to engineering — can help make 
that happen. As it does, all 
women become better off.

But first, we need to help 

each other get there. From 
challenging 
the 
stereotypes 

that hold women back, to 
serving as resources for other 
women, to simply being real 
and honest with our friends and 
on social media, we can help 
make it easier for women to 
deploy their talents and efforts 
to improve society as a whole. 

C

urrently, 
there 
is 
a 

variety of undeniable 
signs 
cropping 
up 

around me that indicate I’m 
graduating, 
from 

the flood of emails 
in my inbox about 
commencement 
to 

the small mountain 
of coffee cups I have 
near my study spot 
from 
late 
nights 

with senior capstone 
projects. It would be 
hard to write off the 
amount of evidence 
sitting in front of 
me that I need to start 
preparing for college to be 
over. However, until recently, I 
was a master of denial; without 
a clear path in front of me for 
my post-grad steps, I just didn’t 
want to think about the future. 

It wasn’t until I was talking 

with my mom at the end of 
Spring Break that I knew I 
needed a better way to think 
about 
this 
upcoming 
life 

change. She pointed out that, 
while I can continue seeing 
graduation 
as 
seven 
long 

weeks away, or an entire half a 
semester away or even as being 
more than 1000 hours from 
now (a lifetime!), graduation is 
next month now — which is, in 
fact, not a lifetime. 

When I resumed breathing 

after that chilling realization, 
I tried to sort through some 
new coping mechanisms for 
tamping down the desire to dig 
my heels in harder against time. 
Ultimately, I’ve found that, 
above all else, the knowledge 
that time is completely relative 
has been a massive help in 
making my way through my 
final semester in a relatively 
calm way.

One of the hardest things to 

overcome in handling the fear 
that comes with graduating is 
a lack of concrete plans after 
getting kicked out of the dorms. 
This anxiety gets even worse 
when people around you do, 
in fact, have things figured out 

already, whether it’s grad school, 
a career or some turf picked out 
for 
panhandling. 
Considering 

the relativity of time can give a 

healthier perspective 
on this, though.

This 

understanding 
of 

the relativity of time 
comes from a couple 
places for me. First, 
a couple semesters 
ago, I took a course 
on rocket science 
(which does mean 
that I am officially 
a rocket scientist 

and get to pretend 

to be superior). While doing a 
refresher course on physics, 
we covered Einstein’s laws of 
motion and theory on general 
relativity, which show that 
time is relative. That is to 
say, bodies being acted upon 
by different levels of gravity 
will experience the passage 
of time differently.

The other classes I can point 

to where the relativity of time 
was discussed are my linguistics 
courses. It was pointed out that 
some languages, like Hopi, don’t 
conceptualize time in the same 
way that English does. Based on 
theories of linguistic relativity 
and, more specifically, Sapir-
Whorf’s hypothesis that our 
language shapes our experience 
of 
reality, 
this 
language 

difference has the implication 
that even our experience of time 
differs based on how we express 
it. 
Someone 
speaking 
Hopi 

instead of English might have a 
completely different perception 
of the passage of time.

In short, time is an illusion, 

changing based on how we 
think about it or what our 
frames 
of 
reference 
are 

compared to others’. What’s 
“slow” 
or 
“early” 
for 
an 

individual is completely open 
to interpretation in the grand 
scheme of things. 

While 
Einstein’s 
theories 

are usually applied to physical 
motion, and linguistics uses 

the idea of time as a tool for 
comparing worldviews, I find 
that these ideas can very easily 
be applied to dealing with the 
fear associated with being “on 
time” in life.

When I begin to compare my 

own progress to that of those 
around me, it’s easy for me to 
see how relative time is. More 
often than not, the timing of 
milestones and the general 
timelines that others operate 
on are different enough from 
my own that it’s pointless or 
even misleading to use them 
for myself.

Most notable for me was 

that many of my friends are 
in engineering fields, which 
began to hire months before 
any of the jobs I would be 
applying to. Seeing people 
around 
me 
settled 
with 

concrete 
plans 
made 
me 

more panicky than normal, 
until I recontextualized the 
timeframe. 
Their 
timelines 

are not my own, and I’m not 
running late or falling behind 
at all; I’m running on my 
own 
time, 
figuring 
things 

out and trying out avenues of 
possibility at my own speed.

While there are deadlines 

that I need to hit soon (I am 
more than aware that I need 
a job soon, don’t remind me), 
as soon as I stopped looking 
at what others were doing as 
a direct comparison to what I 
was doing, I felt infinitely more 
relaxed. My first post-grad job 
is probably not going to be my 
last, and I can take my time 
to build up to my dream job of 
being a football-playing queen 
in space.

So, while I am still hyper 

aware of the passage of time 
right now, and I’m still not 
exactly racing toward that 
finish line, I at least know that 
I have options, I have ideas 
and, more than anything, I 
have time.

C

onfession: I (probably) 
had norovirus.

Confession: I damned 

10 of my housemates to making 
offerings before our soon-to-be-
besmirched porcelain idols for 
two to three days.

Confession: I spent my 

precious few conscious 
hours 
binge-watching 

“Rick and Morty.” 

Despite 
not 
being 

made for Netflix, “Rick 
and 
Morty” 
is 
the 

perfect show to binge-
watch. The jokes are 
fast, the episodes are 
short, the animation is 
colorful and the premise 
is simple. The show has very 
loose continuity (and because 
inter-dimensional travel is a 
key plot device, I don’t think a 
viewer would have to watch the 
episodes in order to necessarily 
understand what’s going on).

But as I finished my latest 

binge-watching session, I had 
a bizarre realization: I didn’t 
have anyone to talk to about 
the show with. It’s not because 
the show is an empty calorie 
cartoon: “Rick and Morty” is 
unafraid to explore themes of 
existentialism 
and 
mortality 

alongside diverse topics such 
as feminism and imperialism 
(and do so coherently! It really 
is a testament to the sheer 
imagination of creators Dan 
Harmon and Justin Roiland). 

Upon some reflection, I think 

the biggest cause of this void was 
the way I consumed “Rick and 
Morty.” Instead of watching the 
show week-by-week, I watched 
the bulk of it at once on a sketchy 
Chinese website offering to sell 
me “Mail Enhancement Pills.” 
I indulged myself alone both 
spatially and temporally.

My memories of “Rick and 

Morty” don’t exist solely as 
a 
relationship 
between 
the 

program 
and 
me, 
they’re 

constructed by how I watched 
the show. Instead of watching 
it with a bunch of friends, I 
saw each episode in solitude. 
This has implications for how 

I interacted with 
it. 
According 
to 

Robert R. Provine, 
a 
neuroscientist 

and 
psychology 

professor 
at 
the 

University 
of 

Maryland, people 
laugh 
nearly 
30 

times more when 
they’re in a group 
than when they’re 
by 
themselves. 

The content may be the same for 
everyone, but how you engage 
with it changes depending on the 
individual. At the end of the day, 
I probably enjoyed the show less 
because of how I viewed it.

Our 
consumption 
has 

also 
become 
asynchronous. 

Television used to be a communal 
experience, even if you weren’t 
with anyone per se. The nation 
was tuned in to the same show 
each night. Cliffhangers had 
meaning. People could make 
predictions with each other 
while they waited with bated 
breath for the next episode. This 
doesn’t happen with shows that 
are available all at once, like 
“House of Cards.” The ebb and 
flow of the whole season doesn’t 
mean much if it’s all consumed 
in one week (or as is often the 
case, one night).

This phenomenon falls into a 

broader paradigm of the internet 
destroying synchronous rituals. 
Once again, we lose something 
tangible 
in 
our 
collective 

cultural 
consciousness. 

Memories are formed through 
repetition, and when we all 
devour a show like “House of 
Cards” in such a short time, we 
are more likely to forget the 

show’s content. It has become 
more difficult to mull over 
the show long after its time 
has passed.

I don’t want this column to 

be a simple polemic about how 
the internet is ruining society. 
There are historical analogues 
to this. Back in the ’90s, if you 
got into a TV show late, you 
would watch it on VHS after 
everyone else. However, VHS 
faced physical constraints on 
the number of episodes its 
viewers could access at a given 
time; viewers didn’t have access 
to every tape at once, and tapes 
held a limited amount of footage. 
But the accessibility of shows 
on streaming services — and 
the advent of shows released in 
bulk on those services — makes 
the phenomenon a much more 
common occurrence.

I don’t want to understate how 

awesome 
streaming 
services 

are; they let people watch shows 
when they want for them rather 
than forcing people to watch 
whatever is on. In addition 
to 
making 
television 
more 

convenient, people from all over 
the globe can enjoy “Rick and 
Morty.” Once again, this isn’t 
a totally unique process and 
there are additional important 
ways 
we 
can 
historicize 

this: Reading in the secular 
context has often been a solo 
endeavor. Book clubs are the 
exception, not the norm. But 
we do lose something when 
we watch a show all at once, 
not as individuals, but as a 
collective. That’s emblematic 
of what the internet does 
as a society: It empowers 
the individual but atrophies 
everything around them.

‘Rise’ and LGBT issues

On Friday June 26th, 2015, 

the justices of the Supreme 
Court of the United States ruled 
that same-sex couples had the 
right to marry nationwide, 
sending 
the 
country 
into 

a state of celebration and, 
in 
some 
places, 
fervent 

opposition. 
Although 
the 

White 
House 

may have been 
lit up in rainbow 
lights that day 
in 
solidarity, 

the 
SCOTUS’s 

decision 
wasn’t 

unanimous; 
it 

was a 5 to 4 vote. Ever since 
then, the rights of the LGBTQ 
community have been under 
assault, in situations that both 
do and do not receive national 
attention.

“When We Rise,” ABC’s 

four night TV special, begins 
in the ‘70s to tell the story of 
a few individuals who were 
fighting 
for 
these 
rights, 

which did not end with the 
right to a marriage certificate. 
These years were by no means 
the beginning of the struggle 
for the LGBTQ community, 
but a time in which issues 
surrounding sexuality — and 
the right to love and/or sleep 
with someone of any gender — 
were receiving more national 
attention than ever before. 
It travels through time to 
the beginning and growing 

fear of the AIDS crisis, often 
focusing on cities. While most 
of the people themselves are 
fictionalized — though the 
show does follow the story of 
Harvey Milk’s rise, fame and 
assassination — the challenges 
that 
they 
face 
feel 
more 

relevant now than ever.

At times, the stories in 

“When We Rise” are woven 
together with precision and 
delicacy; at others, they are full 

of schmaltz and 
sentimentality 
(it 
includes 

the line “Your 
summer of love 
turned 
into 
a 

winter of heroin 
a long time ago.”) 
In the opening 
episodes 
the 

show reveals the dislike and 
exclusion 
of 
lesbians 
and 

other queer women in certain 
groups in the women’s rights 
movement. But the rendering 
of this feels like a tongue-in-
cheek move; the women who 
voice those views sound more 
like the white women from 
“The Help” whose ideas are 
also framed to be laughed at 
at times, rather than people 
with 
harmful 
views 
who 

were fracturing a movement. 
However, the writing of the 
show captures the flipsides 
of issue like these with more 
accuracy: the reluctance to 
associate 
with 
terms 
like 

lesbian or dyke even if there 
is a personal connection to the 
connotations. A few quiet but 
powerful scenes show a black 
man’s progress in fighting 

racism in the military while 
still having to deal with the 
pervasiveness of homophobia 
— 
all 
while 
keeping 
his 

sexuality a secret.

The writers of the show are 

more successful in showing 
how the struggle for LGBTQ 
rights was impacted by and 
affected by other movements 
for social progress — the 
Women’s Rights Movement, 
the Civil Rights Movement 
and the Antiwar movement 
— than it is in showing 
complications 
of 
personal 

stories in such a short amount 
of space and time. While the 
performances are fine, they 
skew 
towards 
feeling 
like 

those hokey reenactments in 
historical documentaries.

“When 
We 
Rise” 
isn’t 

always the heart-wrenching 
drama that it often tries to 
be. It’s overtly sentimental, 
several makeout scenes are 
awkwardly 
high-school 

worthy, and there are subplots 
revolving around the lesbians 
that feel more like a joke’s 
punchline than an attempt 
at a real story. But the show 
does get a few things right: 
the momentum of youth, the 
importance of physical spaces 
for queer communities, the 
fierce pride and joy of loving 
acceptance — and, perhaps 
most chillingly, the shock that 
a gunshot-like sound makes 
in the middle of an upbeat 
scene 
because 
we 
already 

believe that someone would 
threaten the safety of those 
involved because of their quiet 
happiness.

SOPHIA KAUFMAN
Daily Book Review Editor
‘Fall’ & the millenial condition

The film adaptation of Lauren 

Oliver’s 
YA 
novel 
“Before 

I Fall” is the philosophical 
“Groundhog Day” for the selfie 
generation 
that 

pensive 
teens 

have been waiting 
for. Director Ry 
Russo-Young 
(“Nobody Walks”) 
ensures that the 
young adult flick 
goes 
beyond 

the 
overused 
YOLO 
theme 

and approaches the familiar 
plot with a certain nuance 
that many teen movies lack. 
The film follows Samantha 
Kingston (Zoey Deutch, “Why 
Him?”), who seemingly has 
it all: the douchey boyfriend, 
the giggly clique and the legs 
of Gigi Hadid. Sam realizes 
that her life may not be as 
flawless as it seems as she 
relives the day leading up to a 
fateful car accident again and 
again. Throughout her déjà vu 
adventures, Sam shifts from a 
selfish queen bee to a caring, 
mindful friend.

At the film’s start, Sam and 

her posse are unbearably basic. 
They 
Snapchat 
everything, 

they shriek one too many 
times and they say things like 
“bae” and “Should I post this?” 

What at first is an irritating 
representation of today’s teens 
soon becomes a scarily accurate 
portrayal of this generation. 
While Sam is evolving with 
each rendition of her last day, 
her friends are stagnant. No 
matter how much she grows 

one 
day, 
her 

buddies make the 
same 
immature 

remarks the next 
day. 
Yet, 
the 

friendship of Sam 
and 
her 
clique 

goes far beyond 
the surface level. 

While other teen movies may 
focus on the romantic, “Before 
I Fall” brings some much-
needed attention to the value of 
friendship for the average teen 
girl.

“Before I Fall” manages to 

capture Sam’s personal growth, 
while allowing her to develop 
relationships 
and 
storylines 

with her surrounding cast of 
characters, all within the frame 
of one repetitive day. From 
the loving gaze of a childhood 
crush 
to 
the 
unapologetic 

sexuality of the token lesbian, 
from the relentlessly bullied 
misunderstood loner to the 
adorable little sister with a 
lisp, Sam attempts to mend the 
relationships she has failed 
to foster. Sam is, at the film’s 
beginning, self-absorbed and 
cruel, but after repeating the 

same day the same way, she 
realizes 
something 
needs 

to 
change. 
What 
begins 

as 
confusion 
turns 
into 

indifference, then anger. Only 
then does Sam decide to take 
charge of her fate and make her 
last day a worthy one.

What 
“Before 
I 
Fall” 

accomplishes is Sam’s struggle 
to discover what she needs to 
change in herself and in her 
relationships in order to end 
the cycle that afflicts her. Sam 
becomes 
increasingly 
more 

aware of her shortcomings 
with each rendition, leaving 
everyday a little wiser. While 
the film is a loop of the same 
day, Deutch turns what might 
initially feel mundane into 
a captivating narrative. Her 
performance 
adds 
layers 

of 
depth 
and 
sincerity 
to 

her 
character’s 
struggle, 

making Sam’s redemption an 
endearing one. Sam’s growth 
is the hallmark of the film, 
leaving viewers satisfied by 
her metamorphosis, yet the 
ending is exactly that — an 
ending. What the audience fails 
to realize at the film’s finish is 
that Sam is in fact reliving her 
last day, the last day before she 
fell. Sam’s path to discovering 
empathy is paved with the 
lessons she has learned and 
the love she has gained, yet the 
viewer still craves redemption 
for Sam after February 12th.

FILM REVIEW

‘Refugees’ humanizes

It takes a certain type of 

genius to write endings the 
way Viet Thanh Nguyen does: 
with candor, poetic grace and a 
haunting emotional spark that 
sticks. In his newest collection 
of short stories, “The Refugees,” 
Nguyen’s endings 
don’t 
merely 

slap 
on 
some 

haphazard 
finishing touches; 
they ripen each 
story’s 
content, 

leaving them to bloom and 
tickle the mind even after the 
book has finished.

“Black-Eyed 
Women,” 

the first story of the book, 
is 
a 
satisfying, 
immersive 

introduction 
to 
Nguyen’s 

style. It follows a Vietnamese 
ghostwriter who lives with her 
aging mother; the two women 
are visited by the ghost of the 
writer’s 
brother, 
who 
died 

years earlier when the family 
was fleeing the war. Nguyen is 
intimately masterful in the way 
he describes the awkward first 
meeting between the sister, 
now a middle-aged spinster, 
and her brother’s waterlogged 
spirit, who swam for years to 
get to America. As the details 
of her brother’s death and 
the circumstances of that day 

are revealed, the suspenseful 
buildup to the story’s broiling 
emotional 
climax 
is 
heart-

stoppingly memorable, at times 
difficult to read and persistently 
hard-hitting.

The 
stories 
in 
“The 

Refugees” 
have 
several 

common 
themes 
— 
family, 

alienation, independence and 
personal growth — but the book 
never feels repetitive. This is 

due in part to 
the 
drastically 

different 
main 

characters 
and 

situations 
that 

live in each story 
world, 
from 
a 

woman whose ailing husband 
mistakes her for a former lover 
to a young man with a host 
family comprised of a gay couple 
adjusting to life in America. 
Many 
of 
the 
stories 
also 

involve strained relationships 
between parents and children. 
Sometimes the problem is due 
to a generational conflict, and 
other times it’s more influenced 
by culture, but the pain and 
anger depicted is immediately 
understood by anyone who has 
ever argued with their parents 
(or their children!).

Most 
characters 
in 
the 

book 
are 
either 
related 

to 
an 
immigrant 
or 
an 

immigrant themselves. “The 
Refugees” 
implores 
readers 

to remember that, in the end, 
refugees are people. Nguyen 

delicately balances relatable, 
fundamentally human conflicts 
with cultural identity issues 
that not everyone may have 
personal experience with.

“The Refugees” is almost 

disarmingly 
realistic 
in 
its 

candid depictions of imperfect 
lives; it’s easy to forget that 
the stories are fiction and read 
them as a collection of memoirs. 
“Fatherland” recounts 23 year 
old Phuong’s excitement when 
Vivien, her stepsister from her 
father’s first marriage comes 
to visit Saigon; the first contact 
the two have ever had. Because 
she grew up in Chicago, Vivien 
is glamorous, wealthy, and 
successful, everything Phuong 
wants to become. But when 
Phuong finds out that Vivien’s 
“perfect” life is actually a 
facade, she’s left to deal with 
the 
rubble 
of 
her 
broken 

expectations, a process that 
reveals her inner strength to 
herself and the reader. 

Nguyen reminds us that 

regardless of where we are 
from, 
human 
beings 
react 

to conflict in the same ways. 
When faced with those who 
are unlike us, it’s important not 
to close off, as Carver learns 
when he struggles to reconcile 
with his daughter in “The 
Americans,” and not to judge 
too quickly, as Phuong realizes 
in “Fatherland.” The best we 
can do is to keep an empathetic, 
open mind.

‘Pass’ and life after loss

From the opening pages of 

“This Too Shall Pass,” it’s clear 
that this book is more than what 
meets the eye, and definitely 
a book not to be judged from 
its cover. The summary on the 
book explains that the story 
follows Blanca, 
a 
40-year-old 

mother of two 
who 
is 
now 

having to cope 
with the loss 
of 
her 
own 

mother through dementia, but 
this sells the story short. At first 
this seems like the book would 
be a harrowing experience for 
the reader; however this is 
entirely not the case. This book 
is a treasure trove of witty 
insights, with a very modern 
take on living with loss.

Translated from the original 

Spanish — and set in Spain — 
reading this book feels like a 
lovely trip to the Mediterranean 
with a few friends. Despite 
the sombre beginnings, and 
Blanca’s constant referrals to 
“you,” her deceased mother, the 
book maintains an unusually 
optimistic tone. Blanca is a deep, 
real and quirky main character, 
and despite the brevity of the 
book, her insights on the world 
are 
both 
inspirational 
and 

intelligent. Her interactions 
with other characters in the 
book are unusually brief, and 

no quotation marks are used; 
instead dashes indicate the 
start of speech, and the end has 
to be inferred by the reader as 
there is no clear change from 
the end of a character talking 
to Blanca’s personal thoughts. 
This 
quickly 
draws 
the 

attention back to our heroine’s 
inner monologues, which are 
the highlight of the book, and 
definitely more interesting that 

what 
the 
side 

characters have 
to say.

The 
entirety 

of 
“This 
Too 

Shall 
Pass” 

feels 
like 
an 

in-depth character analysis of 
the main character, more than 
a romance or tragedy. Blanca 
stumbles through encounters 
with lovers and ex-husbands 
in several scenarios, but these 
men are just fleeting moments 
before we are returned to 
Blanca once again pondering 
her 
relationship 
with 
her 

lost 
mother. 
Although 
this 

may seem to distract from 
the current events, it is these 
flashbacks 
and 
ponderings 

that are really the highlight of 
this book. Through these we 
learn the convoluted history 
between 
Blanca 
and 
her 

mother, and throughout the 
book these emotions of loss 
and conflicted love between 
mother and daughters serve 
to create a lovely mosaic of 
the history between the two 
women. 
Because 
the 
book 

is written from the author’s 

own experience of losing her 
mother, it is easy to see where 
the emotional inspiration came 
from; at times it feels like the 
reader is peeking into a diary.

This book is a completely 

uplifting 
and 
eye-opening 

experience, as it goes through 
emotions that many people 
may 
not 
have 
experienced 

themselves, and shows how 
there’s always a way out of 
the other side of hardship. 
Regardless of the reader’s age, 
it’s incredible insightful and 
all the characters offer small 
tidbits into their lives. Blanca 
is a wonderful protagonist 
that isn’t perfect in many 
ways, but her bumbling and 
convoluted ramblings make her 
compassionate and someone 
who you’d want to get a beer 
with. The book never feels 
dragged out, and the ending 
is open for interpretations; 
it doesn’t feel like it has a 
conclusion. It is both wistful 
and upbeat and fits the theme 
of the hopefulness that the 
book carries with it.

‘Taken’ a stale outing

Remember 
the 
2008 
film 

“Taken?” Given that the movie 
grossed over $200 million and 
spawned a cult around Liam 
Neeson (“Schindler’s List”) as 
an unstoppable action force, the 
chance that you remember it is 
high. However, the average movie-
goer likely doesn’t recall — or 
chooses to forget — 
the 2012 and 2014 
sequels, 
“Taken 

2” and “Taken 3,” 
respectively. 
While 

these films generated 
solid 
box-office 

figures, they were 
replete 
with 
trite 

dialogue, 
rushed 

storylines and a generic brand of 
supporting cast.

Unfortunately, NBC’s television 

adaptation of the film trio, the 
unoriginally-dubbed 
“Taken,” 

reeks entirely of the latter two 
movies. 
As 
the 
series’ 
title 

indicates, the show attempts to ride 
off the coattails of the first movie, 
while simultaneously paying little 
attention to the qualities of the film 
that made it successful. This lack of 
awareness dooms the show, with 
“Taken” offering nothing in the 
way of a compelling storyline or 
decent cast, along with containing 
some of television’s most bland 
writing.

From the series’ first scenes, 

“Taken” gives off the impression of 
lazy production. The show opens 
with Clive Standen’s (“Vikings”) 
character, Bryan Mills, aboard a 
train with his sister Cali, forgettably 

played 
by 
Celeste 
Desjardins 

(“Lost & Found”). The entire 
setup doesn’t attempt to hide the 
obvious: their lives are in danger, 
evidently being pursued by men 
donning trench coats and refusing 
to remove their hands from their 
pockets. Such suspicious-looking 
attire immediately sticks out to any 
audience member as a poor excuse 
for a criminal’s garb. It’s the type 
of outfit that is so stereotypically 
and classically linked with shady 

activity 
that 
it 

leaves 
viewers 

wondering 
just how much 
effort the show’s 
creators put into 
“Taken.” 
While 

some programs do 
have 
predictable 

elements, the fact 

that it was clearly apparent from 
this scene that Cali was going to 
be murdered by these assassins 
is a sign of sloppiness — the sort 
of which prevents “Taken” from 
gaining any momentum.

The show’s overall lack of care 

and creativity extends into its 
writing, which is plagued by a 
continuous stream of unoriginal 
and banal lines. Outside of a solid 
speech by Romano Orzari (“White 
House Down”) as the series’ central 
antagonist, 
“Taken” 
has 
only 

generically-written conversations 
that sound as if they are ripped 
straight from any terrible action 
movie of the past 20 years. Even the 
briefest, simplest scenes contain 
vague, nonspecific language that 
does little to entertain viewers or 
present “Taken” ’s plotline in an 
interesting or exciting way, with 
Standen describing his late-sister 

by saying: “She was something, 
let me tell you. Beautiful. Kind. 
Smart.” With such general lines 
filling the show, it’s no wonder 
none of the characters display any 
depth.

To make matters worse for 

“Taken,” it is composed of an 
unconvincing cast that lacks any 
semblance of chemistry. Playing 
the show’s star, Standen brings 
little emotion or intrigue to his 
part, claiming extreme remorse 
over his sister’s death yet never 
showing any. As an intelligence 
officer, Jennifer Beals (“The Book 
of Eli”) is also content to read 
monotonously from the series’ 
generic script. Despite possessing 
terrifying roles on the surface as 
characters with cartel connections, 
Gaius 
Charles 
(“Friday 
Night 

Lights”) and Monique Gabriela 
Curnen 
(“The 
Dark 
Knight”) 

inspire zero fear in either viewers 
or Mills himself. For the cast of 
“Taken,” its only redeeming quality 
is Kris Holden-Ried (“Lost Girl”), 
who delivers a quality performance 
as a corrupt DEA agent driven by a 
sincere emotional desire to protect 
his family, unlike Standen.

Though Holden-Ried is solid in 

his part, his role is far too minor and 
his performance not memorable 
enough to fix the inherent flaws 
of “Taken,” which are extreme. 
The series’ lazy production value 
extends to nearly every aspect of 
the show, begging the question 
as to why NBC elected to market 
it so heavily and with such high 
expectations. As a television show, 
“Taken” bears nothing in common 
with the successful film beyond 
the names of its characters, and it 
should be avoided like the plague.

‘The Good Fight’ laudable

I’ll admit, when I first heard 

about CBS’s plan to make one 
of its first series for its new 
online portal, CBS All Access, 
a spinoff of “The Good Wife” 
(after “Star Trek Discovery” 
was 
delayed), 
my 
reaction 

was an eyeroll. At its peak, 
“The Good Wife” was one of 
the best shows 
on 
television. 

However, by the 
end of its run, it 
was 
struggling. 

Its finale ended 
on such an angry 
and bitter note 
that I didn’t know if I wanted 
to ever spend more time in 
the universe and with these 
characters. Still, my love for 
the majority of “The Good 
Wife” ’s run piqued my interest 
just enough to get me to tune 
into “The Good Fight,” and 
I’m so glad I did. With the new 
series, Robert and Michelle 
King’s (“BrainDead”) writing 
feels reinvigorated and fresh 
as they somehow make old 
characters more compelling 
than before.

“The Good Fight” follows 

Diane 
Lockhart 
(Christine 

Baranski, “Into the Woods”) 
who, as she’s about to retire, 
loses her life savings when 
a ponzi scheme run by her 
investor, Henry Rindell (Paul 
Guilfoyle, “CSI”) is exposed. 
She’s forced to postpone her 
retirement and go to work for 
the firm Reddick, Boseman, & 

Kolstad. Lucca Quinn (Cush 
Jumbo, “Vera”) works there as 
well, and Diane brings along 
Maya Rindell (Rose Leslie, 
“Game of Thrones”), a new 
associate who is also Henry’s 
daughter.

“The Good Fight” continues 

what 
“The 
Good 
Wife” 

started in terms of letting a 
great ensemble of New York 
City actors work with strong 
material. 
Something 
“The 

Good Wife” did 
so very well was 
build out a deep 
cast 
of 
strong 

actors, from the 
regulars to the 
guest 
stars. 
It 

all 
starts 
with 

Baranski, 
who 
provides 
a 

compelling center for the show. 
She portrays layers of Diane 
that we haven’t seen before. 
She’s clearly hurt after her 
husband cheated on her and 
Alicia 
(Julianna 
Margulies, 

“ER”) exposed it publicly in the 
“Good Wife” ’s finale. As she 
works her way through losing 
her life savings and starting a 
new job, Baranski brings these 
emotions to life. Jumbo also 
does excellent work as Lucca, 
as we see her take the lead 
on cases and become a more 
relevant character.

Being on CBS All Access 

means “The Good Fight” can 
do more in terms of language 
and sexual content than “The 
Good Wife” ever could. As 
Diane finds out about the 
Rindell’s ponzi scheme, the 
show cuts to commercial, but 
not before she can exclaim, 
“Fuck!” It sounds jarring at 
first, but the show takes its 
extra abilities and runs with 
them, and the language is now 
a part of the fabric of the show.

It’s through the story where 

“The Good Fight” truly stands 
out on its own. The case-of-
the-week format remains from 
“Wife,” but fewer episodes 
seems to allow for them to 
come up with cases are more 
interesting than later seasons 
of “Wife.” This year, we’ve seen 
a surgeon fight for the right to 
assist a surgery in Syria over 

Skype and a woman try and 
regain the rights to her eggs in 
order to have a child, running 
into twisty legal hurdles along 
the way. The show’s also found 
a more natural way to integrate 
politics into the show. The 
first episode opens with Diane 
watching 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s inauguration with a 
shocked look on her face, and 
the show had a story in its third 
episode where the lawyers at 
Reddick, Boseman, & Kolstad 
struggle to keep a client who 
wants to go to a firm where the 
leaders are close with Trump. 
Throughout “Wife,” the Kings 
showed an interest in keeping 
up with current affairs, but on 
“Fight,” they have found a way 
to be relevant without forcing 
it.

“The Good Fight” reminds 

me of exactly what I missed 
about “The Good Wife” in the 
first place. It has a similar 
cast 
of 
extremely 
talented 

actors 
with 
a 
compelling 

central character in Diane. 
It’s surprising how well the 
pieces of this show fit together, 
and I’m excited to see where 
they take these stories and 
characters.

‘M’ set for 
rematch 
vs. Purdue

WASHINGTON — Wednesday 

afternoon, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team was set to fly to 
Washington 
D.C. 
for 

the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament.

But a plane 

accident 
derailed 
the 

Wolverines’ 
plans, 
and 

they 
were 

forced to fly 
out 
Thursday 

morning, 
landing 
just 

three hours before the noon tip-
off and not arriving at the Verizon 
Center until about 10:40.

That didn’t stop Michigan, 

though, as it came out on fire, 
jumping out to a 20-point lead and 
ultimately won, 75-55.

Now, less than 24 hours after 

that victory, Michigan will have an 
even tougher test in No. 13 Purdue.

“That’s the beauty of the (Big 

Ten Tournament),” said sophomore 
forward 
Mortiz 
Wagner. 

“Somehow you gotta get to the next 
one in any way. It doesn’t matter 
what happened. We (did) it once 
now, we can do it twice.”

“Luckily, we just played Purdue, 

so we still know the strategy, we 
still know how they play.”

The two squads met just 12 days 

ago back in Ann Arbor, where 
the Wolverines pummeled the 
Boilermakers, 82-70, on Senior 
Day. Wagner scored 24 points, 
including 20 in the first half, on 
10-of-15 shooting.

Even more impressively, he did 

it with Big Ten Player of the Year 
Caleb Swanigan on him for most of 
the game. Swanigan couldn’t keep 
up with Wagner, allowing him to 
get open frequently for pick-and-
pop shots.

On the other side of the court, 

Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson shut down 
Purdue’s duo of big men Swanigan 
and Isaac Haas, holding the pair 
to a combined 26 points and 11 
rebounds. They average 31.3 points 
per game in addition to 17.7 boards 
per game.

“I think for me personally it 

helps a lot too because (they) won’t 
change 
their 
whole 
playbook 

through two weeks or one week,” 
Wagner said. “So you know what 
they’re going for.”

Added Wilson: “My biggest 

thing is trying to stay in front of 
them and box them out. They’re 
two great rebounders, especially 
on the offensive glass. So I need to 
try to stay in front of them, chest 
them up and box them out.”

Michigan, 
though, 
shot 
an 

astronomical 65.5 percent in the 
first half, and replicating that 
performance against the No. 1 seed 
in the Big Ten will be a tough act.

“We know that they’re Big Ten 

champs,” Wilson said. “They’re a 
great team, they have a great post 
presence and they shoot the ball 
well from 3.”

Outside of its frontcourt, Purdue 

boasts guards Carsen and Vince 
Edwards (no relation), who average 
12.3 and 10.6 points, respectively, as 
well as guard Dakota Mathias, who 
is one of the Big Ten’s most prolific 
3-point shooters, shooting 47.8 
percent from behind the arc on 136 
attempts.

The Wolverines will also see 

a familiar face in guard Spike 
Albrecht, 
who 
transferred 
to 

Purdue this past offseason after 
four years in Ann Arbor, though 
Albrecht has played a minimal 
role on the Boilermaker team. He 
averages just 12.9 minutes per game.

Since Senior Day in Ann Arbor, 

Purdue has won twice. But as 
well as the Boilermakers have 
played this season, Michigan’s 
confidence might be at an all-
time high after it has won seven 
of its last nine games.

“To be honest with you, I think 

this group can beat anyone,” 
Wagner said. “That’s how much I 
believe in this group.”

That confidence grew Thursday 

when the Wolverines beat the 
Fighting lllini just hours after their 
flight. Now, the biggest challenge 
for Michigan will be to play with 
the same adrenaline when a bit of 
normalcy returns to their lives.

Wolverines have a chance to play spoiler

It is fitting that the Michigan 

hockey team will end the regular 
season against No. 11 Penn State. 
Nearly 
three 

years 
after 

a 
bitter 
loss 

that continues 
to 
linger 
in 

the minds of 
six 
seniors, 

the roles are 
reversed in this 
weekend’s two-
game 
series 

against 
the 

Nittany 
Lions 

in Ann Arbor. 

One storied 

program 
has 

endured 
a 

recent but significant decline — a 
downward trajectory that began 
with an opposing program seeking 
to make a name for itself in the 
wake of its birth. In the aftermath, 
a rivalry has blossomed between 
two schools that share just four 
years of history between them.

Senior weekend at Yost Ice 

Arena is upon Michigan, and with 
the finality there is inherently 
introspectiveness — especially 
for the home team, as it concludes 
a long season that has not gone 
the way anyone had hoped. The 
Wolverines 
will 
look 
across 

the rink and find an offensive 
juggernaut clawing its way to an 
NCAA Tournament bid — a team 
that resembles Michigan teams 
of years past. Penn State will take 
the ice against a team that, in some 
ways, resembles early iterations 
of the Nittany Lions: hungry and 
desperate, with nothing to lose.

Just how did these two teams 

end up in this position, mirroring 
each other’s pasts?

The rivalry began four years 

ago during the 2013-14 season — 
the second year of Penn State’s 
existence as a Division I program 
and its first in the newly formed 

Big Ten. The Nittany Lions were 
upstarts looking up at teams like 
Michigan, a program that already 
had decades to establish its place 
within the hierarchy of college 
hockey. The Wolverines were the 
class of the conference, coming 
off a 22-year NCAA Tournament 
streak that had ended the year 
before. Their success as a program 
was what Penn State would hope 
to emulate.

The Nittany Lions spent much 

of that year punching up at other 
teams, hoping to knock down a 
few of them. It just so happened 
that they first experienced success 
against Michigan — and in doing 
so, 
derailed 
the 
Wolverines’ 

season.

Michigan’s 4-0 loss in State 

College on Feb. 8 that year was 
Penn State’s first Big Ten win in 
program history. The Wolverines’ 
5-4 overtime loss on Feb. 21 was 
the Nittany Lions’ first road Big 
Ten victory. And then, the final 
blow came at the inaugural Big Ten 
Tournament, where Penn State 
beat Michigan in the first round. 
The Wolverines’ unexpected loss, 
coupled with the previous two 
losses to Penn State that had hurt 
their PairWise Ranking, ended 
their season and attempt to return 
to the postseason. And a rivalry — 
however improbable its existence 
may have seemed before the 
season — was forged.

“It kinda came out of nowhere 

… especially in hockey, they’re a 
new team,” said senior forward 
Alex Kile. “You just didn’t really 
expect it. That first year, they 
basically ruined our season. They 
ended our season in the Big Ten 
Tournament, but throughout the 
year they just beat us, and the 
same with sophomore year — 
they beat us. We kinda felt like we 
always had the better team, but 
they found a way to beat us.”

The Nittany Lions got the 

better of Michigan the following 
year as well, splitting a series in 
Ann Arbor before sweeping the 

Wolverines at home. Through 
two years, Michigan had just a 
3-6 record against Penn State, 
with each of those losses playing 
a crucial role in keeping the 
Wolverines 
from 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament.

This year, again, the Nittany 

Lions have owned Michigan, 
winning the first two meetings by 
a combined score of 11-2.

Nagelvoort 
attributes 

Michigan’s difficulty against Penn 
State to the Nittany Lions’ “run-
and-gun” style — a high-octane 
offense that peppers opposing 
goaltenders with shots. The past 
few years have also seen the 
Wolverines struggle tremendously 
on defense, often giving up many 
more shots than they generate. 
That slide, coupled with Penn 
State’s offensive strategy, is one of 
the reasons why the Nittany Lions 
had so much early success.

It’s 
not 
inconceivable 
that 

those earlier Michigan teams 
made the mistake of overlooking 
Penn State, all while the Nittany 
Lions 
regarded 
those 
games 

as benchmarks for the young 
program’s progression — the type 
of games to circle on the calendar. 
It is true that Michigan coach Red 
Berenson has instilled his team 
with a mentality to take games one 
at a time. But the regular season is 
long, and players are acutely aware 
of how talented their opponents 
are. And in those early years, 
the Wolverines had the definite 
on-paper advantage over the 
Nittany Lions — perhaps leading 
to some glancing past them.

“They surprised some teams,” 

Nagelvoort said. “We were one of 
those teams. … I think they had 
performances that were above 
their paygrade at the time — 
which, give them credit for. They 
beat us and they beat some other 
teams that they quote-unquote 
shouldn’t have beat.”

At this point, though, there 

appears to be little possibility that 
Michigan overlooks Penn State, 
which is 21-9-2 and in position for 
its first NCAA Tournament berth, 
or is surprised by its offensive 
scheme going forward.

They have finally accepted their 

new role — however unfamiliar 
or unexpected it may be — as the 
scrappy underdog. It is a different 
type of reality: Michigan can no 
longer move up in the Big Ten 
standings. An NCAA Tournament 
berth won’t be on the line for them 
this weekend. But the motivation 
is easy to find — for the six seniors 
whose careers will be celebrated 
after 
Saturday’s 
game, 
the 

weekend provides one last chance 
for retribution against Penn State. 
They have an opportunity to end 
their careers differently than how 
they began them, as the spoiler 
instead of the spoiled.

“Last year, we got our way with 

them, and this year, as seniors, we 
remember the feeling (from) our 
freshman year of them knocking 
us out of the tournament,” Kile 
said. “We have an opportunity 
where if we sweep them, we can 
make it really hard on them to 
make the tournament, so that’s 
our goal. … We want to sweep 
them this weekend and screw up 
their season.”

SOFTBALL
Michigan tries to ease 
pressure in Kentucky

Michigan 
softball 
coach 

Carol Hutchins has noticed 
a simple theme plaguing her 
team. 

“I think when the kids feel 

the pressure, they try too hard,” 
Hutchins said. “That’s exactly 
what is going on with them.”

Despite the success that 

the 17th-ranked Wolverines 
typically enjoy against the 
nation’s 
elite 
programs, 

Michigan has gone just 2-5-1 
against 
ranked 
opponents 

this season — including three 
shutout losses in California 
over Spring Break.

So in this weekend’s Jim 

Cropp Classic, which features 
two matchups against No. 19 
Kentucky and contests with 
Evansville and 
Kent 
State, 

Hutchins 
simply 
wants 

her hitters to 
relax 
at 
the 

plate.

 “This year’s 

been 
tougher 

than previous 
years 
— 
we 

haven’t started 
the 
way 
we 

wanted to,” said senior right-
hander Megan Betsa. “One of 
the biggest things (Hutchins) 
keeps stressing is do less. One 
of the biggest things we need 
to focus on is that it’s just a 
softball game.”

Thus, this week’s practices 

were centered around mental 
composure 
and 
hitting 

under pressure — both of 
which have developed into 
significant shortcomings in 
the opening month. Michigan 
even took two practices off 
at the beginning of the week 
following a 10-day California 
trip in hopes of collecting 
themselves. 

Junior first baseman Tera 

Blanco has fallen victim to 
this tension more than any 

Wolverine, as her batting 
average has plummeted 180 
points from last season’s .404 
mark. Blanco — statistically 
Michigan’s 
best 
returning 

hitter 
from 
2016 
— 
has 

especially been a focus of the 
relaxed approach Hutchins is 
trying to instill in her team. 

“Tera tries too hard, and 

tried so hard that her swing 
gets really big,” Hutchins said. 
“We did a couple good drills 
that helps you stay short to the 
ball and smack it, and she was 
better at my station today, but 
she’s got to quit trying.”

Sidelined with an injury, 

sophomore outfielder Natalie 
Peters didn’t play in the second 
California tournament over 
spring break. Hutchins said 
that she hopes to use Peters 
this weekend and will continue 

to 
tweak 

the 
batting 

order 
until 

Michigan finds 
consistent 
offensive 
production 
— 

not 
a 
single 

lineup 
was 

repeated 
in 

the team’s five 
games 
last 

weekend.

Sophomore 
second 

baseman 
Faith 
Canfield 

combated the sluggish trend 
set by Wolverine hitters last 
week, suggesting that she 
could see more at-bats near 
the top of the order. She hit 
.538 and provided the team 
with its only two runs in a 
2-0 victory over Cal State 
Fullerton last Friday.

While Canfield has enjoyed 

recent progress, a matchup 
with a ranked Kentucky team 
provides Michigan with the 
challenge the Wolverines have 
faced all season, balancing 
pressure with performance.

But for the team to have 

success, 
as 
Hutchins 
has 

reminded them all week, it’s as 
simple as not trying too hard.

“I think when 
the kids feel the 
pressure, they 
try too hard.”

‘M’ heads to Lipscomb for series

The Michigan baseball team 

(9-3) is fresh off a stellar spring 
break trip in California, but the 
Wolverines couldn’t care less. 
The only thing on their minds 
is their upcoming series against 
Lipscomb (8-4) this weekend. 

“Hank Aaron told us when 

he spoke to us, ‘What you did 
yesterday is only good for 
wrapping dead fish,’ ” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“Spring Break has nothing to 
do with today or the weekend 
moving forward. We’ve got to 
re-center, get back to training 
and busting our butts and 
working hard to allow us to have 
success moving forward.”

Michigan will kick off the 

three-game 
series 
Friday 

afternoon in Nashville, Tenn. 
Though the team may not be 
interested in what happened 
last week, it has surely garnered 
some national attention.

The Wolverines entered the 

D1baseball.com poll at No. 24 and 
the Collegiate Baseball News poll 

at No. 19. If Michigan continues 
with its impressive offense, these 
rankings will only improve.

After a hot start, redshirt 

sophomore 
outfielder 
Miles 

Lewis has not cooled down and 
has led the Wolverines with 
a .340 batting average, while 
three of his teammates are also 
batting above 300.

Sophomore 
infielder 
Ako 

Thomas follows closely behind 
Lewis with a .333 average, 17 
hits and 10 RBIs. He’s also tied 
for fourth in the nation in stolen 
bases, in which Michigan also 
ranks first as a team, success that 
comes from a more aggressive 
style of play.

“We’re just as fast as we were 

last year,” said senior infielder 
Michael Brdar, who also already 
has seven steals this season. “It 
was (Thomas and my) first year, 
didn’t have all the confidence 
we do now. I think now when 
we run the bases we have more 
confidence and trust ourselves.”

The Wolverines may not have 

faced any similar opponents to 
the Bisons this season, but they 
know what to expect.

“Our coaches do a very good 

job at scouting,” Thomas said. 
“They’ll give us the scouting 
report on who we’re going to 
face: pitching, types of hitters 
they have, the kind of defense 
we’re going to be in and things 
like that. That usually helps 
prepare us most for teams we’ve 
never played before.”

Michigan’s junior left-hander 

Oliver Jaskie has established 
himself as the best on the mound 
for the Wolverines. He boasts a 
2.25 earned-run average, 16 
strikeouts and has only allowed 
11 hits through 16 innings.

Lipscomb’s 
biggest 
threat 

on the mound is right-hander 
Dayton Tripp, but due to a 
rescheduled 
game 
against 

Tennessee Tech, Tripp pitched 
on Wednesday and is unlikely 
to see the field against the 
Wolverines.

The Bisons may be riding 

a high from a two-game win 
streak, most recently beating 
Tennessee Tech and Auburn, 
but if they’re anything like this 
Michigan team, they will only be 
looking ahead.

CAPITOL WILL

Just hours after arriving in Washington 
following plane accident, ‘M’ powers past 
Illinois in Big Ten Tournament, 75-55

WASHINGTON — The past 24 

hours have been a whirlwind for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team.

After attempting to take off 

for the Big Ten Tournament 
on Wednesday afternoon, the 
Wolverines’ team plane slid off 
the runway amid turbulent winds. 
Though no one faced serious 
injury, Michigan faced a long delay 
in reaching Washington, D.C.

The 
Wolverines 
didn’t 

arrive at the Verizon Center 
until approximately 10:40 a.m. 
Thursday morning — less than 
an hour and a 
half before their 
scheduled 
noon 

tip-off 
against 

No. 9 seed Illinois 
(18-14 overall) — 
after a 7:30 a.m. 
flight from Detroit 
courtesy of the 
NBA’s Pistons.

With 
their 

game 
uniforms 

still on the plane 
that crashed in 
Ann Arbor, the Wolverines took 
the court in their practice attire of 
maize jerseys and blue shorts.

But different clothes and a 

different time didn’t slow down 
No. 8 seed Michigan (21-11) against 
the Fighting Illini, as it rode a 
red-hot start to a 75-55 victory 
to advance to the tournament 
quarterfinals. 

“What these guys have been 

through the last 24 hours has been 
incredible,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “… It’s made them so 
resilient. They played connected 
like they were yesterday when 
we got a hundred-some people off 
an airplane it seemed like in two 
minutes.”

The Wolverines looked fresh 

from the rescheduled 12:20 p.m. 
tip, dominating the majority of the 
first half before Illinois began to 
climb its way back. While those on 
the outside looking in might have 
expected Michigan to fall victim 
to tired legs or distracted minds, 
the Wolverines were locked in like 
men on a mission.

“Sometimes it’s more than 

just basketball we play for,” 
said sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner. “We played out there 
to prove ourselves, that we’re 
tough and that nothing can stop 
us really. And for the sake of this 
group, it helps us so much to 
stick together.”

Michigan opened the game on 

an 15-4 run, punctuated by a rare 
four-point play from junior guard 
Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
to take a double-digit lead just five 
minutes into the contest.

The Wolverines kept rolling 

in the next five-minute stretch, 
forcing Fighting Illini coach John 
Groce to call timeout. After senior 
wing Zak Irvin stole the ball from 
Illinois center Maverick Morgan, 
he lobbed an alley-oop pass to 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 

DJ Wilson, who took flight and 
emphatically finished at the rim to 
put Michigan ahead, 22-9.

The 
Wolverines 
built 
a 

20-point lead soon thereafter, 
capitalizing 
on 
nine 
forced 

turnovers which they scored 12 
points off in the stanza. 

“I think that’s the No. 1 team 

offensively in the Big Ten,” said 
Illinois guard Tracy Abrams. 
“When you play guys like that, 
little things matter. Every play, 
every possession matters.”

But Illinois responded with a 

15-4 run of its own to close the half, 
led by Abrams. With a personal 
10-0 stretch, he drove through the 
lane with ease and finished from 

both the key and 
the perimeter to 
limit Michigan to 
a 40-29 halftime 
lead.

On the other 

side of the break, 
Abrams 
started 

where he left off, 
nailing 
another 

triple to narrow 
the 
Wolverines’ 

lead 
to 
single 

digits for the first 

time since the first five minutes of 
the opening stanza.

As has often been the case 

for the Wolverines this season, 
though, in the moments when the 
Fighting Illini began to threaten, 
senior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
provided the steady hand to right 
the ship for Michigan. Walton 
immediately answered back with 
a 3-pointer of his own, part of his 
12-point outburst in the second 
half to finish with a team-high 
19 total.

Though the Wolverines thought 

they had the game all wrapped 
up down the stretch, Illinois 
began another comeback attempt, 
cutting Michigan’s lead to 10 with 
just four minutes left on the clock. 
That’s when Walton nailed back-
to-back 3-pointers to give the 
Wolverines all the breathing room 
they would need to close out the 
blowout win.

Despite 
the 
challenging 

circumstances of their journey 
to Washington, D.C., Michigan 
proved that it still had much 
to play for in the tournament. 
But in this particular game, the 
Wolverines put their bodies on the 
line for one particular man.

Thanks to their high energy 

and clear focus, Beilein earned 
the 210th victory of his Michigan 
career to become the winningest 
coach in program history. 

“It’s 
an 
awesome 
feeling, 

especially with Coach B, one 
of the best coaches in the 
country,” Irvin said. “He’s done 
so much for this program, for 
the players. …It’s just an amazing 
accomplishment, and I’m just so 
happy to be a part of it.”

As chaotic as the past 24 hours 

have been for Michigan, the next 
24 hours won’t let up — as they 
now have another game to play in 
the tournament against No. 1 seed 
Purdue on Friday at noon.

play for.”

Abdur-Rahkman sets stage for postseason encore with season-high 17 points

WASHINGTON 
— 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
wasn’t 
the 
hero 
Michigan 

expected as it put together its five-
game postseason run last year. He 
was the one it needed.

With guard Caris LeVert lost 

for the season due to injury, then-
junior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
caught in a shooting slump and 
then-junior wing Zak Irvin bogged 
town by the heavy scoring load 
already placed on his shoulders, the 
Wolverines knew they needed to 
find a new source of points heading 
into the Big Ten Tournament or 
start planning for an early summer.

From there, the stage was set 

for Abdur-Rahkman to put on his 
best show. The then-sophomore 
guard entered Michigan’s opening 
round game of the conference 
tournament playing the best 
basketball of his young career. 
He posted double-digit scoring 
figures in three of the Wolverines’ 
final four regular season games, 
and looked as consistent as he ever 
had in a Michigan uniform.

Abdur-Rahkman was ready 

for a breakout performance on 
the big stage, just when his team 
needed it the most to reach its 
postseason goal.

In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
five 

combined games in last season’s 
Big Ten Tournament and NCAA 
Tournament, 
Abdur-Rahkman 

averaged 15 points per game — the 
highest of any five game stretch 
of his career — and stepped up to 
keep Michigan’s season alive.

Abdur-Rahkman 
peaked 
at 

the right time then, and as the 
calendar flips to March again, 
it looks like he’s about to do the 
same for the second straight year.

After finishing the regular 

season with six straight double-
digit point tallies, the now-junior 
guard has peaked at the right 
time, and is ready to play an 
integral part of the Wolverines’ 
next tournament run.

“You just want to play your 

best in the postseason,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “I just try to 
channel that and focus on the 
little things, try to hone my skills 
and up it in March.”

Thursday 
against 
Illinois, 

Abdur-Rahkman scored a season-
high 17 points, grabbed three 
rebounds and notched three 
assists to push Michigan to the 
quarterfinals of the conference 
tournament. The junior set his 
tone that, just like last season, his 
mind is set on bringing his best 
stuff to extend his team’s season.

Like his usual self, Abdur-

Rahkman’s offense derived from 
being aggressive driving the lane, 
and finishing easy buckets at the 
rim. The guard kept Fighting 
Illini defenders on their toes by 
dialing up from deep — four of 
his 13 shot attempts were from 
beyond the arc.

But Abdur-Rahkman’s outing 

Thursday was different than 
those he had in the previous 
postseasons. Not only was the 
junior scoring points for the 
Wolverines, he was preventing 
Illinois from scoring itself.

“Maybe before we — even 

myself — were guilty of caring 
about 
offense 
too 
much,” 

Abdur-Rahkman said. “I think 
now 
we’re 
worried 
about 

defense, and getting out and 
running, instead of worrying 

about offense. We’re letting our 
defense turn into offense.”

Abdur-Rahkman finished with 

three steals, made plays on the fast 
break and opened up opportunities 
to convert on the Fighting Illini’s 
offensive mistakes.

His finest stretch came on a 6-0 

run halfway through the second 
half, 
which 
Abdur-Rahkman 

single-handedly 
constructed. 

After driving to the hoop for two 
straight layups, the guard started 
a fast break off a steal, dribbled 
all the way to the hoop and found 
senior wing Zak Irvin under the 
hoop for the assist.

“It’s a conscious effort trying to 

get buckets in transition instead of 
half-court sets,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “In order to do that, you have 
to play defense.”

If Abdur-Rahkman can catch 

fire like he did last year over this 
stretch, his abilities to make plays 
on both ends of the court could lift 
Michigan to uncharted heights as 
it looks for postseason glory. He 
saved the Wolverines last season, 
now Abdur-Rahkman could be a 
paramount piece in Michigan’s 
plan to surpass expectations.

Michigan sheds the stigma

W

ASHINGTON — “It 
felt like pain. I was 
thinking, you either 

submit to the pain or you keep 
pushing.”

Derrick Walton Jr. was 

talking about running away 
from the plane. He could have 
just as easily been talking about 
Michigan’s season roughly a 
month ago.

The Wolverines could have 

submitted to the pain and 

accepted a season that was 
spiraling toward mediocrity 
and an NIT bid, or keep pushing 
and earn an 
invitation 
to the only 
March 
tournament 
that matters.

Michigan 

chose the 
latter, and 
the 33 days 
that followed 
all led to 
Thursday afternoon, as the 
Wolverines took the floor for 
their opening matchup of the Big 
Ten Tournament against Illinois.

They had all the excuses in 

the world to swallow one loss, 
pack their bags and go home.

Less than 24 hours earlier, the 

power went out in Crisler Center. 
Michigan chose to practice in 
the dark.

A few hours later they 

boarded a plane to Washington 
D.C. They never made it in the 
air — skidding off the runway 
due to high-speed winds and 
an aborted takeoff. Walton 
picked up a gash on his knee 
that needed five stitches. He still 
tied fellow senior Zak Irvin for 
a team-high 37 minutes played 
against Illinois.

After the accident, they went 

back to Ann Arbor. They woke 
up this morning at 6 a.m., took 
a bus to Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport, departed at 7:30, landed 
at 8:45 and took a bus straight to 
the arena.

“Curfew was 10 last night,” 

said senior forward Sean 
Lonergan. “I’ll give you five 
dollars if you can find anybody 

who probably fell asleep at 10 
o’clock. Everybody was just — 
still had that adrenaline kicking.”

Michigan was supposed to tip 

off at noon. The Big Ten told the 
Wolverines that they were willing 
to move the game time. Michigan 
asked for 20 minutes instead.

Illinois was playing for an 

NCAA Tournament bid. The 
Wolverines could have lost and 
still gone dancing.

And then 

there was the 
issue of jerseys 
— albeit the least 
of Michigan’s 
worries. The 
Wolverines were 
required to leave 
their gear on 
the plane as it 
was part of the 
Federal Aviation 
Administration’s 
investigation of the accident.

They improvised, hitting the 

hardwood at Verizon Center in 
their practice jerseys — outfitted 
more like an AAU team than a 
Division I basketball program. 
Then they punched Illinois in 
the mouth, finishing with a 
20-point victory to advance to 
the quarterfinals of the Big Ten 
Tournament.

“That was kind of the question 

walking back into the locker 
room, like, ‘If we get our real 
jerseys back tonight, what do 
we do tomorrow?’” Lonergan 
said. “I’m sure we’ll have a 
conversation about that.

“I don’t have any clue what 

the status of our actual jerseys 
are, so who knows at this point? 
… I like it. I like it a lot.”

This is the same team Illinois 

center Maverick Morgan called 
“white collar” back in January.

And in truth, maybe they 

were. Maybe the stigma of 
being “soft” that has followed 
the Wolverines in the modern 
era was warranted. Then again, 
that’s the point.

As senior guard Andrew 

Dakich said: “Sometimes they’re 
right, and sometimes it makes us 
mad that they’re right.”

Michigan’s 

senior class has 
seldom gone 
a day without 
hearing the 
outside chatter. 
The five seniors 
walked into 
it, and they’ve 
spent their 
careers denying 
it. But on 
Thursday, they 

finally made you believe them.

“A lot of people question our 

toughness, and I think that kind 
of sums it up right there,” said 
senior forward Mark Donnal. “It 
takes a tough team to be able to 
move on from that. … It tells a lot 
about our team — the type of guys 
we have, the type of characters, 
that are able to just kind of move 
on from something that happened 
to them so recently. We were not 
feeling bad for ourselves, we were 
ready to play basketball.”

So call the Wolverines soft. 

Tell them they’re a white-collar 
team. After the last 24 hours, 
frankly, they don’t give a damn.
